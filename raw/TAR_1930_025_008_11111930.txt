CARNEGIE FAILS TO REGAIN CITY CHAMPIONSHIP TROPHY 
FROM PITT BY SINGLE POINT
Tartans Score Seventeen 
First Downs to 
Pitt’s Six
EYTH AND KAVEL GAIN
Plaids Outclass Panthers 
in All But Second 
Quarter of Game
By G. O. Myers
Saturday saw one of the most 
colorful and- spectacular football 
games in the history of the pigskin 
regime in Pittsburgh. However, 
with all . its color it was a damper 
in the hearts of the Tartans, and 
added one more to the alarming 
number of defeats that they have 
suffered this season. Three times 
the Tartan machine thrust down to 
the Pitt 10-yard line, and three 
times the Schcnlcy rivals held, 
without a flaw, while the Tech 
fans hoped and prayed for a 
touchdown.
Carnegie found the Panthers a 
harder nut to crack than they had 
anticipated. The first quarter was 
a scc-saw affair, and things did not 
liven up until the second period, 
when Hood of Pitt, after a march 
down the field, plunged over the 
goal and put the Blue and Gold 
ahead. It was also in this quarter 
that the Plaids received their first 
chance to score after recovering a 
Panther fumble on. their nine-yard 
line. However, as hard as they 
tried, the ball was still one yard 
from the coveted line on the fourth 
' down. [
Pitt Line Holds
CarncgiQ's hopes rose high iii 
the last half of the game when 
Karcis'plunged, over the goal and 
made «lie score 7-6, but then , fell 
again ajftcr Pitt stopped the Tartan 
••¦tf'Tvsc dead when they threatened 
To put over another score.
If the final score was counted 
according to the number of first 
downs and yards gained from 
scrimmage the Tartans would have 
won by a two to one bet. They 
gained 276 yards from scrimmage 
to Pitt's 128, and made 17 first 
and tens to their opponents' 6, 
nearly three times as much in both 
cases. However, when the ball was 
within scoring . distance everything 
seemed to go wrong and things 
went to a near standstill.
Pitt Scores First
The Blu.c and Gold made the 
first score of the game in the sec­
ond quarter. Heller .gained ten 
yards on two plays for Pitt’s initial 
first and ton and placed the ball on 
the Tech 44-yard line. Then on a sc­
ries .of line plays Reidcr and Clark 
bucked down to the 23 yard stripe 
for another first down, and follow­
ing this came a pass from Heller 
to Reidcr who got to within six

chain of Kingsley Halls every­
where. . She delivers lectures on 
"Adventures fn Fellowship;” Think­

and Tagore” and "The Art of Life.” 
The cabinct thinks the girls will be

Kingsley Hall was started in 
1914 in London, England, by men 
and women who arc bound to 
frankness and the facing of the 
facts. They believe "We must ap­
proach the poor with, the mind of 
the poor.” They do their best in 
organizing demonstrations, dispatch­
ing food and clothing, and awak­
ing public opinion to alleviate bad 
conditions.

the National Student Y. W. Com 
mittce and twenty-five dollars to

By George H. Follows
“When evening shadows softly fall 
As firelight dances on the wall 
Old days and dreams come hack lo vie
And fill- my heart 'with ’memory."
If I Were a painter I would dedi­
cate a canvas to "Memory.” I would 
mount him on an old and faithful 
war horse, his fighting days over, his 
battles won—or lost—as the case 
might be. And I would’ make of 
Memory himsclj: a noble figure, of 
great strength of limb and breadth 
of shoulder, with shock of iron-grey 
hair. But what you would notice mc>st 
about him would be his serene and 
kindly eye, forgetful of all but the 
best of things, touching • ever the 
humor in life, the things that bring 
the smile, the. quiet chuckle over 
some of those happenings that seemed 
perhaps of 110 great import at the 
time but that have lived on while so 
'many others have faded into the 
mist of the forgottc...
Surely 110 member of the faculty 
as it was 011 October 16, 1905, that 
"first day,” when the doors of Car­
negie were opened, will ever forget 
the tumult, the feverish excitement 
and enthusiasm, the willingness to 
be anywhere and do anything to 
make the thing a "go”—I think of 
no other word that means just what 
I want to mean—a willingness that 
was shared by everybody, as we 
followed, or tried to follow, a tenta­
tive “schedule of classes.” I did what 
every other instructor did . . . met 
classes every hour, and talked to 
them about whatever was 011, top of 
my mind; and I could give those1 
talks again today, if it were at all
desirable. What, the other members 
of the faculty talked about I have 
not the remotest idea now, although 
3rou may be sure we swapped stories 
afterwards. On our occasional meet­
ings during those rush hours, our 
eyes were wide open; and our modths 
too, I suspect; for our jaws were 
too tired to close, and our voices 
grew fainter with the passing of the 
hours.
Just now . . . Memory insists, and 
seems to know where he is going 
. . . 1 am thinking of the Sunday 
before the opening day, and of 
other Sundays before that, when 
members of the faculty", scattered 
groups of students-to-be, and a 
sprinkling of the cvcr-curious public, 
used to wander into Schcnlcy Park 
and find their way into those first 
Carnegie buildings— .t the tail end 
of what is now the Industries Col­
lege—which were being so feverishly 
prepared for October 16. The mem­
bers of “Ye Old Guard” were all 
wont to be there. We used to wander 
about and wonder \yhere our own 
"quarters" were to be; everything 
was in a mess—crates full and crates 
empty; rooms filled and in some 
sort of order; rooms empty and ap­
parently unassigned to any purpose 
whatever; stairways incomplete, the 
way out uncertain, we never knew 
where we were, and were continual­
ly getting lost. But what J. really 
have in mind is that no matter what 
those rooms were used for original­
ly, they . have been used for some­
thing else since—occupied and rcoc- 
cupicd beyond recalling. Just where 
was the original Physics Lab.? the 
Chemical? the Electrical?

GRADUATES OF 1910 
MEET AT LUNCHEON
Dr. Baker celebrated the reunion 
of the class of 1910 by giving a 
lunchcon in its honor in his -offices 
Friday, November 7. This was the 
annual luncheon for the class hav­
ing-its twentieth reunion, which is 
held just before 'the Pitt-Tcch 
game.
Mr. Ed-ward Crump, '15, presided 
at the reunion meeting, which was 
held on Saturday morning. The 
class of 1910 fulfilled tradition with 
their presentation of a brass plate 
to Dr. Baker, which is dated and 
placcd in the floor in the Hall of 
Administration Building. This year 
the classcs of 1910, ’15, ’20, ’2o, and 
’30 each gave a plate to be added’ 
to the design in the floor. Mr. 
C- F. Borsbhncck presented the 
plate for the class of ’10; W. N. 
Flannagan for ’15; J. P. Beatty for 
’20; V. S. Mollenaur for ’25; and 
Mildred Bastian for '30. This was 
the first reunion of the youngest 
alumni—those of 1930.
under the supervision of Mr. 
Winniger.. The - novelty is that the 
scenery will be changcd in full 
view of the audience.
Another feature that will make 
the play colorful is the fact that 
John Masefield, the author, who is 
England’s present poet laureate, has 
based it upon the Japanese legend 
of the forty-seven ronin. The play, 
a tragedy in three acts, is a story 
of a. Japanese nobleman’s revenge" 
for the unjust death of his friend. 
Mobs have a very important part 
in the action.
The principal members of the 
cast are: Stanton Cooper, Richard-
Bürrall,’ Clayton Thompson, Robert 
Gill, Burtt McKee, Edmund Smith, 
Raymond Neihart, Ruth White, 
Frances Ardan, Isabella Yealy, 
Elizabeth Drake, Freda Cazcn, and 
Helen Siscnwain.

How Sea Swine Became Mollusk
In First Carnegie School Of 1905
By Willibald Trinks
When Mr. Carnegie had decided 
to found the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, or, as it was known in 
the early days, the Carnegie Tech­
nical Schools, lie called on Dr. 
Brashear to assist him in the §elec- 
tion of the proper personnel. Dr. 
Brashear found in Mr. Hammcr- 
sclilag the man whom he con­
sidered suitable for the position as 
director, and Mr. Hammcrschlag 
began to make appointments in the 
summer of 1905. Among the earliest 
appointees were Mr. Connelley and 
Mr. Wurts. The latter was ap­
pointed professor of Electrical 
Practice, the term "Engineering" 
not being used in the early days. 
Soon afterwards were appointed 
Miss Smith, who took charge of 
the Margaret Morrison School for 
Women; Professor Gibbs, who took 
charge of Physics, and Professor 
Keller, who took charge of Matlie- 
matics. In rapid succession fol­
lowed the appointments of Pro­
fessors Trinks, James, Follows, and 
Leeds, Mr. Pfouts and Professor 
Willett. Some amusing incidents 
occurred in the early days. Each
new application had to be inter­
viewed by all prior appointees, and 
then the director asked each man 
what he thought of the applicant. 
Mr. Pfouts, head instructor in Pat­
tern Making, had to interview Pro­
fessor Willett^ professor of Eco­
nomics, but did not get very far 
because Professor 1 Willett found 
out from Mr. Pfouts all about liv­
ing conditions in Pittsburgh.
The offices of the Carnegie Tech­
nical Schools were in the. old Ger­
man National Bank building, on 
Sixth avenue at the corner of 
Wood street, opposite McCrecry’s 
store.
Mr. Connelley took charge of the 
School for Apprentices and Jour­
neymen, which is now the College 
of Industries. School opened up in 
October, bccausc it was impossible 
.to get the buildings ready in Sep­
tember. The original buildings 
consisted of those which now form 
the College of the Industries, minus 
the Administration hall. In those 
few buildings were located the 
School of Applied Science, which 
is now the College of Engineering, 
(Continued on Page Four)
On Friday, November 14, at 9 p. 
m. the military ball will be held in 
the Union. This is the first annual 
all-college formal on the Carnegie 
social calendar. Each year this event 
is taking a more prominent place 
among the social activities. It has 
the distinction of being the only 
military function on the campus open 
to all students. Last year’s ball was 
Carnegie’s first military formal, and 
it is chicfly due to-its success! that 
this dance is to be formal.
The Venetian Serenaders will fur- 
nishc the music for the occasion. If 
this ten-piece orchestra, composed of 
some of the best musicians in this 
scction, can keep up the record it 
has made for itself so far this year, 
the music will be all anyone can 
hope for.
Decorations To Be Militaristic
The, decorations for the ball will 
be militaristic, aiid arc expected to 
surpass any of former years. A large 
collection of flags, colors, and stand­
ards have been obtained from various 
posts and from the divisional head­
quarters. Spccial arrangements have 
been made to have a unique lighting 
system which will help considerably 
to make this affair one that will be 
remembered for many years by those 
who attend.
The patrons of the ball have beer 
chosen from the faculty members an* 
prominent people conncctcd with Pitj 
burgh military activities. Amon,^ ’ 
those who have acccptcd invitations\ 
arc: Dr. Thomas Stockholm Baker, \ 
Dean and Mrs. A. W. Tarbcll, Col. 
and Mrs. George E. A, Fairley, Mr. 
and Mrs. William E. Mott, 'Mr. and 
Mrs. R. V. Davis, Jr.,"Dr. and Mrs. 
W. R. • Work, Capt. and Mrs. A. S. 
Ackerman, Lt. Vmd Mrs. Wiley V. 
Carter and Lt. F. E. Cothran.
Present Honorary Commissions
The cercmony 'of the presentation 
of the honorary cadet commissions 
will be' most colorful. ‘ Each of the 
honorary officers will be cscortcd by 
the cadet officers of the unit which 
she sponsors. A column, composed of 
the officers and their escorts, will ad­
vance through an arch of sabres and 
be presented to the cadet coloncl. 
Pic will then award the honorary 
commissions, and the insignia of 
rank. They will then facc about, and 
march again through the arch ' of 
swords. The orchestra will play a 
special selection, for this ccrcmony.
The price. of admission will be 
the same as that for last year’s ball, 
$3.50 a couple. Tickcts may bfc se­
cured from members of the Scabbard 
and Blade, or from any of the R.
O. T. C. representatives. . -r
The Scabbard and Blade will make 
its annual call from the junior and 
senior.. men registered in the R. O.
T. C. course.
Max Eastman 
Will Lecture To 
Y.M. & W.H.A.
Max Eastman, an American poet 
and psychologist, copies to the 
Young Men’s and Young Women’s 
Hebrew Association on Tuesday 
evening, November 18, as the sec­
ond lecturer in the current'series 
of lectures.
Mr. Eastman has built up a great 
following in both America and in 
Europe, where many of his books 
have, been translated into the 
German. One of his recent fascin­
ating experiences Jias been an ex­
tended visit to Russia where he 
not only made a thorough study of 
the Communist movement but also 
learned the Russian language. His 
recent book on that country creat­
ed a sensation among leading phil­
osophers in both Europe and Amer­
ica. • 1
While Mr. Eastman was a mem­
ber of the department of psychol­
ogy and philosophy at Columbia 
University he made many contri­
butions to scientific 'thinking radi­
cally differing from those views of 
Pavlov, Frucd and Dewey. Max 
Eastman’s book "The Sense of 
Humor” has been considered by 
Professor McDougal! of Harvard 
University as being "a distinct ad­
vance in the scicncc.” ’
Bccausc his mother and father 
have .been joint pastors of the Con­
gregational Church in Elmira, New 
York.for several years, it have been 
said that Mr. Eastman represents 
the souls of two preachers sur­
vive in the restless prophet of the 
new’ era.”

"Wlmt are our chanccs next year?” 
is a question which has occurred to 
many Carnegie followers after the 
surprise defeat in the recent city title 
battle. One looks at the names on 
the starling line-up of last Saturday’s 
game. Both' ends, both tackles one 
guardrail but two linemen will be 
lost by graduation. In the backficld 
we find two sophomores teamed with 
a pair of seniors.
Crfrncgie will miss these seven men 
and others too, Joe Morbito and 
Thayer Flanagan, both sterling backs 
will also be lost by graduation. After 
spreading all this gloom one might 
really begin to inourn our chanccs 
for a victory in the years to come. 
Next year the ends will be one of 
the biggest problems to , face the 
coaches. Replacing two such alert per­
formers as Rosenzweig and Flanagan 
is no small task. "Marv" Potts and 
Croissant arc the outstanding con­
tenders for their positions. Both of 
them have shown well in the games 
they have seen action in this fall 
and the only thing they lack before 
they can be rated finished performers 
is experience. They by no means have 
the positions clinched, however, for 
Bill Sketres and “Kcd” Stcwcrt, cap­
tain of this year's undefeated Plcbc 
team, are ready lo make them prove, 
thejr worth. At tackle "Don” 
Fletcher is a sure starter and the 
other side ,of the line will probably 
be filled by one of the members of 
this year's Plcbc weleven. The guards 
will be well caijcd for by Sample 
and Burzio, sophomores who have 
alternated on starting opposite Cap­
tain Drcsha'r this year. Then, too, 
another Drcshar will be in there 
fighting for the assignment. John's 
younger brother was a member of 
the Frosh outfit this year and dis­
played much the same fighting quali­
ties as those that carried John so far. 
Ducanis will hold forth at center 
again with Jones in all probability 
furnishing most of the opposition.
Although the backficld will loose- 
Ivarcis and Eyth, the men generally 
regarded as the biggest threats to’the 
opposing outfits, we should have a 
combination that .will strike 'fear to 
the hearts of the enemy next fall. 
McCurdy land Ducgcr will still he 
on hand for the quarterback posi­
tion. The running halfback job should 
be capably handled by Arisen trout, 
Gravino and Sfiylcs. "Army”. has 
proved hi.4 worth during the past 
seasons and is generally conceded the 
edge. Gravino, however, has domi­
nated the game every time he has 
played and Saylcs was a big .gun 
for the Plcbcs. The outside half 
position is a cinch for George Kavcl. 
The way the Norwin boy plays this 
position makes one believe that the 
Steffen style of play was built with 
just such a man in mind to handle 
this assignment. George may be 
shifted to fullback, however, which 
will leave "Chuck” Ewing and 
Duegar as possibilities for this job. 
Otherwise no veteran material will 
be available for the fullback post 
butVTcsser of the yearlings looks 
good for this job. He is a fine punter 
and much will be cxpcctcd of him 
in the role of kicker as well as 
plunger.

ALONG Green Street, where

one pipe tobacco which always rolls

Edgeworth, every time.
A pipe—Edgeworth. That is the

Natural merit has made Edgeworth 
the favorite tobacco in America’s

NOVEMBER 12
NIGHT ENGINEERING 
ELECT OFFICERS
Well, of "all things—Fire—Fire— 
Firc-r-that was the cry one day last 
week in Arts. Did it cause any 
excitement? Well, you should have 
been there. The drafting room 
turned out in their usual good 
form. Sirens- were sounded, and 
one would think a real city fire de­
partment was on the scene. It 
happened like this. About 10:15, 
yes it was P. M., as you came 
down from the advanced Life class, 
your nose was treated with the 
pungent odor of smoke. It was in 
all the hallways, and seemed to 
coming from the third floor were 
'the P. & D. Department holds 
sway. The night watchman was on 
the job and he rushed everywhere 
to find the source of the fire. No 
place could be found on the third 
floor, and still the smell of burnt ma­
terial was getting stronger and 
stronger. Going down to the Mu­
sic Department the odor, bccamc 
irery pronounced and the watchman 
with his eagle eye set for fire 
found the cause of the excitement, 
which happened to be a short cir­
cuit in one of the music rooms. 
Whew, that was an exciting time. 
Everybody took it in good spirits, 
although the “fixitive” odor from 
the third floor suggested other spir­
its—class was just out, you sec.
Speaking of fire, though, it is a 
surprise that tfiere isn’t one over 
there in Arts most -any time. The 
amount of “fags” which are con­
sumed during an evening certainly 
swells the sales in a good many 
brands of “Not a coaid iri a boat­
load,” or “It’s roasted,"' etc. It 
wouldn’t be so bad if they con­
fined their habits to the place pro­
vided for the sweet herb, but no, 
they indulge in the classrooms, 
Even in; recitation rooms, to the 
discomfort of everybody. We Arts, 
you know, we must have our way.
A new use for the Shelter Pa- 
vilipn—A recently saw a group of 
students ^earnestly, engaged, in writ­
ing on paper and a casual look 
disclosed that they were doing 
some of the assignments which 
they had received, in the Shelter.
The annual election smoker of 
the College , of Engineering was 
held'November 1 in the auditorium 
of the Men’s Gymnasium. The 
committee in charge of the affair 
made plans for a very' lively and 
entertaining gathering. A well bal­
anced entertainment was furnished 
and kept those present interested 
during this part of the program.
Mr. Sansonetti, president of the 
Night Student Council, was next 
introduced and he gave a talk on 
the qualifications necessary for 
night student to hold office. After 
some discussion on the qualifica­
tion, the important function of the 
evening was taken up which con­
sisted of the election of officers to 
represent' the College of Engineer 
ing in the Night Student Council. 
Nominations «were made and the 
nominees challenged as to the nec­
essary qualifications stipulated . by 
Council. The nominations were
closed and the candidates were bal- 
lottcd upon, and the final count 
disclosed that Mr. Robert W. Gra­
ham, Mr. William R. Hodder, Mr 
T. J. Werner, and Mr. Matthew A. 
Crawford had been elected presi­
dent, vice president, secretary and 
treasurer,- respectively.
Refreshments had been provided 
and the late combatants broke
bread together, lending a peaceful 
air to the sinoky battleground.
PUPPET
The “Who’s Whoocy" number of 
Puppet will be out on Wednesday, 
November 12.. This number promises 
to be the best issue of the year and 
from all indications the sales will be 
big. You better get your copy as 
soon as'they are placed on sale be­
cause they will not last long af\cr 
the night salesmen £ct on the job.
It struck me funny and I resolved 
that the -builders of the Shelter 
built better than they knew. WJio 
knows, we may yet be forced to. 
have class , rooms on this spqt. 
Open air class rooms where the 
profs, could direct traffic and give 
those wonderful assignments which 
keep us up all night and half of 
next day doing the work, but that’s 
what you git for being a night 
student.
About the Big Game
In every newspaper office, before 
some popular event like an election, 
a prize fight, a world series baseball 
game, a football game, or any other 
affair that has aroused the enthusiasm 
of the general public, there arc two 
forms set up. One form gives the 
story with some anticipated details if 
A wins and the other iorm gives 
the same line of dope if B, wins. 
The purpose for this two-form busi­
ness is this; it takes considerable 
time to make up a page of type and 
if the page is already made up and 
ready- for the press, to which the 
correct form goes as soon as the 
event is over, the paper conics . out 
away ahead of time with the correct 
story, specific details lacking of 
course. /
But what has all this got to do 
with* the Plaid? And the big game 
with Pitt? Surely our College paper 
which comes out once a week can­
not be in such a rush as to want 
to beat some competitor with • the 
story. Here’s the dope, take it or 
leave it. By the time you read, this 
you will know the result of the 
game but of course you always like 
a little first hand information. Very 
little of coursc.
The honorable editor insists on 
having material by Friday p. 
and as the game is not played until 
Saturday, we just had to follow the 
style of other big newspapers and 
write two forms, one fo^m if Car­
negie wins and the other to be used 
if Pitt wins. I hope the latter as 
sumption is incorrect, for I don’t 
mind being wrong once in a while.
If Carnegie wins, read this:
It was a marvelous game and : 
tough one for them to lose. A 
harder fought contest such as this 
otic will not' be seen here for some 
time to come. The closeness of the 
score docs not begin to tell half 
of the battle waged back and forth 
between the uprights before the team 
from the Smoky City finally emerged 
victorious. The game abounded ir

The Night Student’s social activi­
ties have commcnccd .and from the 
enthusiasm shown thus far, a most 
enjoyable season is anticipated. Two 
smokers have been held, one by the 
Industries and one by the Engineers. 
The Industries was, as usual, a very 
successful affair. The Engineers 
smoker was moderately succcssful. 
This was the first attempt of this 
collcgc at holding a smoker on a 
Saturday evening and the attendance 
was not as large as cxpcctcd but 
this did not affect the enthusiasm 
of those who did comc out.
The next social event on the Night 
Calendar is the first Night Student 
Council Dancc, on Friday, Nov. 28. 
The Council dances are usually very 
brilliant affairs so when tickets arc 
on sale, get yours early from one of 
the salesmen you will find in the 
corridors of the various Colleges.

the duty of every night student in

College dances the mjoyable affairs 
they have always been.
Dame Rumor has it that the new­
ly clcctcd officers in the Engineer­
ing College have already started 
work on the annual night Engineers’ 
banquet and say they have several 
surprises in store for this affair.
The above mentioned functions arc 
only a few which the Night Student 
Council and the officers have worked 
up for your entertainment. The 
school year would be a very dark 
and drab season if it were not for 
these little periods of relaxation that

*TSTUDY ROOM POPULAR 
WITH NIGHT STUDENTS
The study room in the Collcgc of 
Industries building, adjacent to the 
Council office and t Y. M. C. A. 
is very popular with the night stu­
dents of that college. Many students 
from Engineers use this room also 
because of the lack of such facilities 
in their own building.
Through the efforts of Mr. R. V. 
Davis, the Y. M. C. A. secretary, 
this room was redecorated and re­
furnished last year and now it is 
about the nearest place to home 011 the campus. That the night stu­
dents deeply appreciate the success 
of Mr. Davis’ efforts is evident by 
the number who make the room a 
regular meeting place with their 
friends and as a place for study and 
preparation.
Our request to the night students 
is that. they treat this room as they 
would their home. The magazine rack 
is in there for a purpose and facili­
ties arc available for those who 
smoke. There isn't much that the Y. 
M. C. A. can do for the night stu­
dents so let us respect what has 
been done.

FOURTH down! Seconds to play! Defending a slender onc- 
point margin of victory, eleven husky bodies have valiantly 
repulsed three smashing attacks which have advanced the ball a 
scant foot to the fifteen-yard line. With success almost certainly 
¦within the defender’s grasp, the field goal specialist drops far back 
b'ehind his stalwart line. A crashing impact — a blur of rushing 
bodies — and his nimble foot sends the ball high between the goal 
posts for the winning points!
Shift this scene to a battle ground of modern business. The goal 
is an important contract... a substantial order for equipment or 
appliances. Salesmanship, backed by a product of established 
quality, plays its important part; but a Westinghouse representa­
tive is more than a salesman. The background of specialized engi­
neering skill that enables him to serve his customers as a consultant 
in electrification is what supplies the necessary “punch” to win.
To many a younger college man with Westinghouse has comc 
the opportunity to dpply his talent toward the conclusion of a 
worthwhile transaction. The young men whose photographs 
appear on this page arc but a few of the many who, with college 
only a fcw years behind them, arc finding success with an organiza­
tion offering such .a variety of opportunities in the world’s elec­
trical work.

by Westinghouse in recent years, wherein younger college

SYRIA MOSQUE
Pittsburgh, Pa.6 Nights 
Nov. 17-22
was present in the lecture room 
and took the lectures down. Of 
course some funny incidents 'oc­
curred. Thus Professor Gibbs gave 
a lecture on .Evolution and stated 
that in the course of time the sea 
slime had developed into a mol- 
lusk. The stenographer had put 
down that in •¦the course of time 
the sea swine had 'cTcvclopcd into 
a walrus.
' In the early days the faculty was 
one large family. Everybody knew 
everybody else, and everybody did 
not only his own work but helped 
the others. Thus, Professor Trinks 
assisted in the purchase of ma­
chinery for the machine shop and 
designed the “A” frames for sup­
portings the counter shafts. He 
also took charge of the equipping 
and operation of the Strength of 
Materials laboratory foe one year.
Soon, after the opening of day 
school, night school was opened 
with a terrific rusJi. There had 
been no night Engineering or Trade 
schools to speak of in Pittsburgh, 
and an enormous number of stu­
dents or prospective students had 
accumulated. The number of ap­
plications was so great that calr- 
toons ,werc published throughout 
the United States showing the Car­
negie Technical Schools with 'stu­
dents trying to climb in through 
the windows in order to gain ad­
mission. In the early days, every 
applicant for admission had to take 
an examination which was to test, 
mainly, his. intellectual capacity. 
He also had to be interviewed by 
the director.\ The director .shook 
hands with the young man, looked 
into his eyes and immediately knew 
whether the applicant would make 
a good engineer or' not. Director 
Hammerschlag had a remarkable 
memory. He used to sit on\ the 
stone railing outside of the en­
trance to the College' of Industries 
which entrance was at that time 
the only one in use. He discussed 
all sorts of problems (particularly 
the fitness of the teachers) with 
the students, and knew every stu­
dent by name.
When school, had been in oper­
ation one ,or two weeks, a splendid 
offer was received from the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh. That .uni­
versity offered a scholarship to the 
best graduate from the School' of 
Applied Science. Acceptance of 
that offer, of course, would have 
established the fact that the'Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh was located 
on a higher plane than the En­
gineering school of the Carnegie 
Technical Schools. - ?
Among the men who were en­
gaged quite early was William P. 
Field, secretary to Dr. Hammer- 
schlag. He was quite a wag. At 
the time of one of the severe 
earthquakes in the West, a re­
porter came out to see Mr. Field 
for the purpose, of finding out 
whether anything of the earthquake 
had been noticed in our scientific 
laboratories. Mr. . Field reported 
that'the Fourcault pendulum in the 
Physics laboratory had acted 
strangely; that notice went out 
through all the newspapers in the 
United States. It did not- add to 
the dignity qf the^institution.

The stiff shirts will • make their 
initial appearance on the campus for 
this season Friday evening, when the 
soldiers put on their annual Mili­
tary Ball in Carnegie’s. Union. Here 
and there amid the bright-buttoned 
splendor of the officers’ uniforms, 
mentioning especially those of Head 
Man Bennie V. Stcpaniak and Kernel 
Frank Mueller, will be found the 
faithful old boiled shirts belonging 
to those who always go to Military 
Balls, and to those few umvorthics 
whose friends were elected Honorary 
Officers and were given free tickets.
Among the pleasant occurrences of 
the evening will be music by the 
Venetian Sqrcnaders and the pre­
sentation ’of commissions to the new 
Honorary Officers. Among the un­
pleasant occurrences will be a.speech 
by ;(Captain W. W. (Won’t Work) 
Ware of Scabbard & Blade. He 
promises to’make it short, however. 
Many; •scarred shins will probably re­
sult from the inevitable spurs worn 
by the officers, but. they must be 
borne in silence. (The scars, not 
the spurs.)
A freshman class •'with lots of 
fight has been found at last. The 
freshman elections Tuesday caused a 
miniature revolution among the Glass 
of r93/l-; Even the impressive dignity 
of Marve (The Great) Pox, Presi- 
'dent of: Ye. Studcnte Council, failed 
to quiet the />lobes' in General As­
sembly.
The gist of the trouble ¿cemed .to 
be that the election. scheduled 
previously for November 18, had 
been moved up to November. 4 by 
Student Council, and the plcbcs 
claimed they didn’t know the nomi-. 
nees> well, enough to vote. Organized 
cheering," to the effect •that “We 
won’t vote'!” shocked the staid upper­
classmen from their habitual-.lethargy? 
One enterprising plebe rose up and 
gav.c a ,pep-talk for the revolters.' A

S.oliie,'-Well-placed words by Marve 
Fox '¦ about “No election, 'no_. fresh­
man dance” served to smooth things 
out for the remainder of the -As­
sembly. After the votes were all 
counted, Engineering and Industries 
freshmen had cast a total of thirty 
votes, iyhich nitmbc- Was far below 
the necessary half o ' the class. An­
other election will be held soon.

THE GOOD OLD ROTC
Was it only twelve years ago? 
It seems centuries and then again 
it seems just j-cstcrday that I stood 
in my father’s office in the Jcnkin’s 
Arcade and watched the snowfall 
and- waste 'paper and ticker tape on 
the first Armistice Day. The crowds 
were wild that November 11th; the 
Avar to end wars had. ended.
We arc not going to refer you 
to the adjoining columns and iron­
ically point out headlines like 
“FRANCE LAUNCHES SPEED­
IEST CRUISEfc,” or “200,000 
BRAZILIANS IN ARMS.” Every 
editorial column in town will be 
doing that. What we want to do is 
to discuss the ROTC.
Nor ' are we going, to call them 
the “ROT Corps,” or the Rotten 
Officer’s Thieving Corps, or any of 
those kindred • names, many of 
which are frankly unprintable.' We 
are going to come right out with a 
statement that we., imagine - will 
shock any of you, if there be, such, 
who have been steady readers of 
this colum.n. ^Briefly, we .like the 
ROTC, we approve of'its basic 
idea, and we actually hold a com­
mission in it ourselves.
If this be heresy to the tribe of 
would-be-' radical column conduc­
tors, then make" the most of it. 
Brushing the trifling matter of war 
aside with the few phrases that it 
was once a biological necessity for
the destruction of the unfit; that 
itv has unfortunately changed to an 
economic mistake for the destruc­
tion of the most fit; and that the 
only panacea for war is to make it 
so terrible that it will become a 
physiological impossibility—a treat­
ment which the machine age is 
rapidly perfecting, we come to the 
ROTC.
General Sherman, with doubtless 
a wider knowledge than our own, 
has called war hell. The ROTC 
in its training camps is doing all 
that it can to reverse this ober- 
dictum. At a camp which I visited, 
there were concrete floors to the 
tents, electric lights, hot and cold 
showers, and real sheets and pil-! 
lows. The • mess was superb, in 
quantity and quality with a flavor­
ing of music from the Regimental 
band. There were weekly dances, 
fully paid trips and excursions to 
places of interest, and a variety-of 
extra military sports—-swimming, 
golf, tennis, and horseback riding. 
And the men were not only sup­
plied with aU clothing and laundry, 
but received rt living daily wage, 
not to mention a generous rail 
transportation rate to their homes 
and back.
Now the army is not giving any­
thing away—their motive is clear 
enough; we’ll. pay you today, you 
come to us when we need you. But 
on the other hand, every man was 
benefited. After camp the boys 
knew that such a thing as discipline 
existed. It was a good thing for 
the utter lack of supervision that 
the college man had grown accus­
tomed to.’ The physical benefit was 
tremendous. From a mass of round 
shouldered rookies, the fraters be­
came an almost straight line of, 
well, rookies. Mostimportant, they 
received a faint inkling x>f that 
tion, of true esprit de corps, that 
can only come with a well trained 
organization or from constant uni-

It is of interest to the editorial staff of the TARTAN that’ 
the part of their platform for the celebration of the twenty-! 
fifth anniversary which provided for a tag sale on Carnegie Day 
has been acted upon by the Student Council. It is indeed grati­
fying to learn that their suggestion has been so heartily , and 
promptly endorsed by the student governing body.
The time is hardly ripe to urge’a proper response on the 
part of the students. Suffice it to say that such a tag day is 
coming, that it will support a Carnegie need, and that" in these 
hard times., it is never too soon td’ start saving those nickels 
and dimes.

Among; the down-trodden ^traditions 
of. Carnegie's camp.us is one that 
should be re-established. The last 
..three or lour years . have witnessed 
the 'infringement of1 undcrciassmcn 
upon the edifice known as the Senior 
Fence, which affords the name for 
this column, liesidcs being a land­
mark of the campus. If we are al­
lowed to be serious for a moment, 
we would like;-to say that it should 
be to the interest of all under- 
classment lo .refrain from sitting on 
the Senior .Fence, in order that they 
may appreciate the privilege in their 
own senior year. It would also 
Seem proper that the Senior men’s 
honorary, Dragons, use their in­
fluence to keep all but Seniors off 
the Fence, by asking them to move 
if necessary. Traditions help to make 
the college!
The Wrong Slant
Last week a part of the student body of one o,f the leading 
eastern universities was penalized very severely for its activities 
following a football game. From recent similar activities that« 
took place in this city previous to and following last, Sat­
urday's game, we gather that the students of Pittsburgh’s t\vo 
leading institutions of le.arning are either negligent about read­
ing the daily papers or have no desire .to profit bv the mistakes 
of others.
Apropos of the recent discussions that have appeared in the 
editorial columns of the TA'RTAN in regard to- traditions and 
spirit at Carnegie, we feel justified in saying that students who 
take part in such engagements have the wrong slant. Undigni­
fied free-for-alls do. not make for, traditions any more than dis­
respect for the law makes for spirit.. A bottle throwing con­
test helps very little toward cheering a team on to victory, and 
pep-rallies that have to be quelled by force are of negligible aid 
in building up the morale of a team. The basis for engagements 
of this sort, if there can be said to be such/ is certainly one that 
is childish and-petty.
It might be well to remember in the future that Pittsburgh 
is not a small college town. Business, and industry have to

importance is being played or not. It might be well to remem­
ber also that when a student body is received in the home town 
of their opponent, it is always with some degree of hospitality 
and friendship. Preaching under such circumstances' does little 
good, but it is quite evident from past history* that overly, en­
thusiastic pre- and post-game, celebrations are not appreciated

MODERN 
TRANSPORTATION ROLLS 
ON TIMKENSLess talk and 
more taste —Swiftly ... smoothly ... silently ... the modern train 
gathers speed or slows to a stop without a jar or jerk. 
Looking for the reason, student engineers find Timken 
—the same bearing that has licked the toughest jobs 
throughout all Industry—the most powerful weapon 
available to them in their future war against mechanical 
waste and inefficiency.
In. railroad cars Timkens have justified their use and 
proved their supremacy in one hundred million car miles 
of travel on one railroad alone.
And why not? For thirty years and more, Timken Bear­
ings have reigned supreme over^friction; have carried not 
one type of load, but all loads—radial and thrust— 
measured in pounds or thousands of tons.
In the air and on the water, by road and rail, Timken 
tapered construction and Timken-made steel roll on to 
new triumphs—saving power and lubricant... promoting 
dependability ... assuring extreme economy of mainte­
nance with supreme defiance of depreciation.
In train service they afford the luxury of smooth, silent 
travel, with starting resistance reduced 88%.
One hundred and thirty-four railroads are now using or 
testing Timken Bearings, so it does not seem a far cry 
to the time when all transportation—passenger cars, 
freight cars, mine cars, motor trucks, buses and motor 
cars will be traveling totally Timken Bearing Equipped.

The cheering effects of a telephone chat

For several tomorrows, you will feel the

"What arc our chanccs next year?” 
is a question which has occurred to 
many Carnegie followers after the 
surprise defeat in the recent city title 
battle. One looks at the names on 
the starting line-up of last Saturday's 
game. Both ends, both tackles one 
guardrail but two linemen will be 
lost by graduation. In the backficld 
we find two sophomores teamed with 
a pair of seniors.
Ciirnegic will miss these seven men 
and others too. Joe Morbito and 
Thayer Flanagan, both sterling backs 
will also be lost by graduation. After 
spreading all this gloom one might 
really begin to fnourn our chanccs 
for a victory in the years to come. 
Next year the ends will be one of 
the biggest problems to , face the 
coaches. Replacing two such alert per­
formers as Rosenzweig and Flanagan 
is no small task. “Marv" Potts and 
Croissant arc the outstanding con­
tenders for their positions. Both of 
them have shown well in the games 
they have seen action in' this fall 
and the only thing they lack before 
they can be rated finished performers 
is experience. They by no means have 
the positions clinched, however, for 
Bill Skctrcs and "Red" Stewert, cap­
tain of this year’s undefeated Plcbc 
team, are ready to make them prove, 
their worth. At tackle ‘‘Don’’ 
Fletcher is a sure starter and the 
other side ,of the line will probably 
be filled by one of the members of 
this ycar!s Plcbc ..eleven. The guards 
will he well cai'cd for by Sample 
and Burzio, sophomores who have 
alternated on starting opposite Cap­
tain Dreshar this year. Then, too, 
another Dreshar will be in there 
fighting for the assignment. John’s 
younger brother was a member of 
the Frosh outfit this year and dis­
played much the same fighting quali­
ties as those that carried John so far. 
Ducanis will hold forth at center 
again with Jones in all probability 
furnishing most of the opposition.
Although the backficld will loose- 
Karcis and Eyth, the men generally 
regarded as the biggest threats to the 
opposing outfits, we should have a 
combination that .«till strike fear to 
the hearts of the enemy next fa!!. 
McCurdy and Ducgcr will still be 
on hand for the quarterback posi­
tion. The running halfback job should 
he capably handled by Armentrout, 
Gravino and Sayles. "Army”. has 
proved hia worth during the past 
seasons and is generally conceded the 
edge. Gravino, however, has domi­
nated the game every time lie has 
played and Sayles was a big gun 
for the Plcbcs. The outside half 
position is a cinch for George Kay cl. 
The way the Norwin boy plays this 
position makes one believe that the 
Steffen style of play was built with 
just such a man in mind to handle 
this assignment. George may be 
shifted to fullback, however, which 
will leave "Chuck" Ewing and 
Ducgar as possibilities for this job. 
Otherwise no veteran material will 
be available for the fullback post 
but »Tesscr of the yearlings looks 
good for this job. He is a fine punier 
and much will be expcctcd of him 
in the role of kickcr as well as 
plunger.

A pipe—Edgeworth. That is the

Natural merit has made Edgeworth
