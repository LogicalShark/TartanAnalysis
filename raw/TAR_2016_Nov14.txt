Donald Trump won the 
presidency despite the fact 
that most college-aged vot-
ers were strong proponents 
of Hillary Clinton. The morn-
ing after the conclusion of 
the tumultuous election, the 
country is largely in disbe-
lief as to how this happened.
It seemed that the number 
of swing states this year had 
signi?cantly increased. Polls 
predicted who the likely 
winner would be, politicians 
rallied, and the media re-
ported on the progress of the 
election, but did any of those 
factors truly affect student 
voters’ decisions? The Tar-
tan interviewed a randomly 
selected group of nearly 100 
Carnegie Mellon students and 
many agreed that these exter-
nal factors did not really affect 
or inform their ?nal decision.
Pennsylvania has been a 
key swing state for several 
previous elections. This year, 
however, Nate Silver, the 
founder and editor-in-chief of 
FiveThirtyEight dubbed it as a 
“tipping-point state,” mean-
ing a Republican victory in 
Pennsylvania would propel 
the party to the White House 
(and ultimately, it did). But 
many Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents sat anxiously in McCo-
nomy auditorium Tuesday 
night wishing for the exact op-
posite. How could a state that 
was visited by the Clintons, 
the Obamas, Tim Kaine, and 
countless other politicians still 
vote red? Pennsylvania, with 
its incredibly diverse income 
demographic, was a crucial 
victory for either party. Both 
sides poured countless dollars 
of campaign funding into tar-
geted ads, propaganda, and 
rallies to claim victory. Yet, it 
seems it was all to no avail.
Trump personally visited 
Pittsburgh twice within the 
past year, while Clinton chose 
to speak at both Carnegie 
Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh. Further, the Clin-
ton campaign brought in sev-
eral high-pro?le politicians 
to advocate on her behalf. 
Amongst the students sur-
veyed, however, most actually 
did not attend any of these 
events.
In fact, as consensus 
shows, students were likely to 
only attend a rally or event if 
they already were in favor of 
the person speaking. As Lena 
Vlahakis, a junior materials 
science and engineering major 
stated, “The rally was to see 
the candidate, but the inter-
net was there to inform.” Ro-
shan Sajjad, a junior mechani-
cal engineering and physics 
double major, furthered, “You 
can be informed without go-
ing to a rally. A rally is going 
to be biased and it won’t ac-
curately present informa-
tion, and won’t convince me 
otherwise.”
Students re?ect on the effectiveness of presidential campaigns

The Tartan conducted two 
exit surveys on Election Day: 
an online survey of Carnegie 
Mellon undergraduates and 
an in-person survey of people 
who voted on campus. Both 
surveys revealed overwhelm-
ing support for Hillary Clin-
ton. However, possibly due 
to hesitancy among Donald 
Trump supporters to reveal 
their preferences in person, 
Trump fared significantly 
better in the online survey.
Which candidates did 
students vote for?
Of the respondents to the 
online survey who voted in 
the 2016 U.S. Presidential 
Election, 77 percent 
supported Hillary Clinton, 
13 percent supported Donald 
Trump, 7 percent supported 
Gary Johnson, 1 percent 
supported Jill Stein, and 2 
percent supported another 
candidate.
In contrast, 88.6 percent 
of respondents to the in-per-
son survey supported Clin-
ton, 5.7 percent supported 
Trump, 2.9 percent support-
ed Johnson, 1.9 percent sup-
ported Stein, and 1 percent 
supported another candidate 
(Figure 1 on A3).
How did voting vary by 
college?
The online survey reveals 
significant differences in 
voting behavior among 
students in different 
Carnegie Mellon colleges 
and schools. 93 percent of 
students surveyed in the Col-
lege of Fine Arts supported 
Clinton, while only 67 per-
cent of students in the Tepper 
School of Business did. The 
rest of Carnegie Mellon col-
leges and schools were in the 
middle, with rates of support 
for Clinton between 73 and 
81 percent.
Which issues were most 
important to students?
We also asked about the 
issues that were important 
to people when deciding 
their vote. In the in-person 
survey, we asked respon-
dents to select from a list the 
single issue that was most 
important to them, and the 
most common answers were 
(1) foreign policy/national 
security, (2) energy/environ-
ment, and (3) immigration.
In the online survey, we 
allowed respondents to se-
lect as many issues as they 
wanted (Figure 2 on A3). The 
most commonly selected is-
sues were immigration (60 
percent), education (60 per-
cent), and foreign policy/na-
tional security (57 percent). 
We split up economic issues 
into trade, taxes, jobs, stu-
dent debt, and economic in-
equality, which could explain 
why the economy seemed less 
important to respondents.
Which issues mattered 
most to Clinton and Trump 
supporters?
In the online survey (the 
only one in which there were 
enough Trump supporters 
to draw conclusions) there 
were significant differences 
in the issues that mattered 
to Clinton and Trump sup-
porters. Clinton supporters 
were twice as likely as Trump 
supporters to vote based on 
economic inequality, nearly 
four times as likely to vote 
based on energy/environ-
ment, nearly twice as likely 
to vote based on healthcare, 
and twelve times as likely to 
vote based on LGBTQ Rights.
On the other hand, Trump 
supporters were nearly three 
times as likely as Clinton sup-
porters to vote based on cam-
paign finance (although the 
issue wasn’t very important 
to many of either candidate’s 
supporters), significantly 
more likely to vote based on 
foreign folicy/national secu-
rity, more than twice as likely 
to vote based on jobs, twice as 
likely to vote based on taxes, 
and more than three times as 
likely to vote based on trade.
Despite the repeated 
chants of “CIT, CIT CIT, we 
have job security!” during 
Carnegie Mellon’s fresh-
man convocation, College of 
Engineering students were 
more likely than students 
of any other Carnegie Mel-
lon school/college to vote 
based on jobs. (The issue was 
important to 54 percent of 
them when deciding which 
candidate to vote for).

On the evening of Nov. 10 
in McConomy Auditorium, 
Carnegie Mellon students 
gathered for Here is My CMU, 
a student-organized event in-
tended to discuss and enhance 
Carnegie Mellon’s diverse 
community. Six undergradu-
ate students and Associate 
Head of School of Drama 
Dick Block shared their per-
spectives, experiences, and 
thoughts on diversity here.
Olivia Roy, a senior 
mechanical engineering ma-
jor, organized the event with 
the help of her advisors and 
other active members of the 
community. “I have been 
thinking about this [event] 
since my sophomore year,” 
said Roy, in an interview with 
The Tartan. In the spring of her 
sophomore year, Roy partici-
pated in the spring break ex-
change to CMU Qatar through 
the IMPAQT program. She 
was moved and inspired by 
Diversity Diaries, an event 
that allowed members of the 
Qatar campus community to 
come together and share their 
unique experiences.
With the help of her 
advisors and supporters 
around her, she applied for 
and received a ProSEED 
grant — a university-wide 
grant program to encourage 
new interdisciplinary ideas 
— which she eventually used 
to organize Here is My CMU. 
“I believe very strongly in the 
power of storytelling,” said 
Roy, “and all the events hap-
pening on campus prompted 
me to do this.” She talked 
to and interviewed students 
around the university in the 
fall to speak at the event and 
received a lot of support from 
different communities.
Rob Stephens, a senior 
international relations and 
politics major, shared his 
early experience with insti-
tutional racism. He pointed 
out the misconception that 
diversity comes from racial 
minorities and discussed how 
this perception is ?awed and 
harmful.
Grif?n Tang, a ?rst-year in 
Dietrich College, spoke about 
his ?rst few months of experi-
ence with the Carnegie Mel-
lon culture. Born and raised in 
New York City, Tang felt that 
the people at Carnegie Mel-
lon had, comparatively, more 
patience and respect for each 
other.
Sandra Ho, a sophomore 
biology major and a member 
of the Carnegie Mellon Varsity 
Swimming and Diving Team, 
shared her struggles with rac-
ism as a foreign athlete at an 
elite boarding school before 
coming to Carnegie Mellon. 
She was condemned for “be-
ing too Asian” and “trying too 
hard to please the coaches” at 
swimming practices, bringing 
up the often overlooked topic 
of discrimination against 
Asians. In her speech, she also 
thanked her friends and team-
mates at Carnegie Mellon who 
have helped her to restore her 
mental and physical health.
Nathan Willis, a senior 
decision science major, shared 
his experience growing up at 
a predominantly white school 
and interacting with a variety 
of cultures. “Diversity is not to 
bridge the differences,” Willis 
said, “but rather to integrate 
them.”
Alex Cerny, a senior 
chemical engineering major, 
spoke about her struggles 
as a student coming from a 
lower ?nancial background 
and the dif?culty of making 
friends with “students from 
the other end of the ?nancial 
spectrum.”
Ashwini Ganpule, a junior 
mechanical engineering ma-
jor, talked about her fear of 
the Donald Trump presidency 
and her experience with sexu-
al harassment and discrimina-
tion at her workplace during 
an internship.
The speeches by these 
students shone a much-
needed light on the 
acceptance of the Carnegie 
Mellon community. Although 
Roy claimed that it was 
not intentional to schedule 
this event around the elec-
tion, Here is My CMU was a 
timely event that encouraged 
students to cherish individual 
identities and uniqueness at 
a time when many beliefs are 
challenged. Such an event 
encourages conversations 
between different groups of 
students and allows students 
to share their different values.
Students share experiences with diversity at Here is My CMU

students to comfortably share their unique experiences with diversity.

Carnegie Mellon students determine that internet voting faces security concernsProfessor Neil Donahue receives Pittsburgh award from the American Chemical Society
Neil M. Donahue, the 
Thomas Lord Professor of 
Chemistry, professor of 
chemical engineering and 
engineering and public 
policy at Carnegie Mellon 
University, has received the 
2016 Pittsburgh Award from 
the American Chemical Soci-
ety’s Pittsburgh Section. Do-
nahue is being honored for 
his research in atmospheric 
chemistry and his leader-
ship in climate science, both 
locally and nationally.
Donahue joined the 
Carnegie Mellon faculty 
in 2000. He is now a mem-
ber and founding director 
of Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity’s Center for Atmo-
spheric Particle Studies 
(CAPS), where he collabo-
rates with colleagues and 
students in science and en-
gineering to understand or-
ganic aerosols. His research 
focuses on the behavior of 
organic compounds in the 
atmosphere that adversely 
affect our health and impact 
our climate. 
He also investigates such 
topics as fundamental quan-
tum chemistry and the for-
mation of molecules that 
stick to particles in the air 
such as wood smoke.
In a university press 
release, it states that Dona-
hue has published over 200 
peer-reviewed articles and 
is one of the most cited sci-
entists in the ?eld of geo-
science. He is also an asso-
ciate editor of the Journal 
of Geophysical Research: 
Atmospheres and co-editor 
of Atmospheric Chemistry         
and Physics.
Donahue received his 
bachelor’s degree in phys-
ics in 1984 from Brown Uni-
versity, and a Ph.D. in me-
teorology and atmospheric 
chemistry in 1991 from the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology.

DOMINIQUE ESCANDON
Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabinet 
Writer of The Student 
Government. 
When we think of our 
time at Carnegie Mellon, 
something that might not 
immediately come to mind is 
how we will help out the fu-
ture generations of students 
who’ll eventually sit in our 
favorite seats in our lecture 
halls or continue our re-
search after we depart from 
this institution.
As a student who 
struggles to cover the cost 
of tuition, I would love to 
see this school continue to 
strengthen its ?nancial aid 
program and I believe that 
giving is a way to ensure 
this effort. After all, my ex-
istence on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus has relied on the 
kind donations from past 
students. Student Body Vice 
President Aaron Gutierrez 
says that the reason why he 
gives is that he “wants to pay 
forward all the opportuni-
ties [he] was provided to 
the next generation.” To me, 
donating as an undergradu-
ate indicates my gratitude 
to Carnegie Mellon and my 
investment in its future, and 
thus the students who will 
?ll this school with wonder 
after I’m gone.
As it turns out, I’m not 
the only one excited about 
making Carnegie Mellon a 
better place. Giving Tuesday 
on Nov. 29 is a full day dedi-
cated to promoting this act 
of giving back to our com-
munity. This 24-hour event 
will offer multiple giving 
challenges throughout the 
day, including prizes of $500 
to gift to a Carnegie Mellon 
fund of your choice, a tour of 
the Steam Tunnels with Vice 
President of Student Affairs 
and Dean of Students Gina 
Casalegno, or even a lunch 
with President Subra Suresh. 
Opportunities for entry in 
these competitions will be 
available across campus, as 
well as throughout several 
social media platforms, such 
as Facebook or Twitter, so 
students and alumni across 
the globe can show their ap-
preciation and engagement. 
There will also be special 
events for student organiza-
tions where the organization 
with the most unique donors 
will be able to win $500.
However, it shouldn’t be 
interpreted that the impor-
tance of giving is what you 
can get back. Contributing 
to a cause ensures that all 
students will be able to en-
joy warm food and safe labs, 
or that faculty and staff will 
be able to take sick days for 
themselves or their fam-
ily without worrying about 
being able to afford it. Re-
gardless of the contribution 
value, it indicates an invest-
ment in Carnegie Mellon’s 
principles of providing a 
high-quality life and engage-
ment with its community. 
When the Class of 2015 ac-
complished a record giving 
rate of 32.3 percent, it indi-
cated to our community that 
there were approximately 
1500 people who were 
months from leaving but 
wanted to make sure Carn-
egie Mellon would continue 
to provide amazing resourc-
es and opportunities for its 
students. How will you pay 
it forward?
A group of Carnegie 
Mellon students in the H. 
John Heinz III College’s 
Master of Science in 
Information Security Policy 
and Management (MSISPM) 
program found that online 
voting in the United States is 
poor and will require strong 
encryption measures in      
the future.
The main concern of the 
project was to ?gure out how 
we could develop a better 
internet voting system for 
the United States. In a uni-
versity press release, Susan 
Dzieduszycka-Suinat, presi-
dent and CEO of the U.S. 
Vote Foundation, said that in 
order to tackle this problem, 
“the students were asked to 
do research on existing sys-
tems and to put together a 
competitive analysis.” The 
students found that the 
current end-to-end veri?-
able (E2E-V) voting system 
needed to be improved.
Many Americans have 
determined that the gold 
standard for voting in 
elections has been paper 
ballots, since they can be 
veri?ed and re-counted by 
hand. However, many states 
now use a system where 
voters can return ballots 
electronically.
Randall Trzeciak, director 
of the MSISPM Program, be-
lieves that there are risks 
with online voting. “There is, 
in my opinion, not an accept-
able level of fraud that could 
occur in a voting process. We 
should have con?dence that 
every vote would count as 
was intended.”
The students developed 
this report in collaboration 
with Galois, an Oregon-
based research and develop-
ment ?rm, and the U.S. Vote 
Foundation.
After it was announced that Donald Trump won the presidency, Carnegie Mellon students placed signs promoting unity and love all over campus. Students joined local Pittsburgh residents in protests, both on campus and 
downtown at Point State Park, and also staged a protest against this outcome downtown. Protesters also held signs with similar messages as those posted around campus. The march spread a message of love across campus.

How did male and female 
students vote?
Breaking it down by 
gender, we notice signi?-
cant differences both in the 
candidates voted for and the 
issues  found important.Of 
female respondents to the 
online survey, 89 percent 
voted for Hillary Clinton, 
compared with 65 percent of 
male respondents. Not a sin-
gle female respondent voted 
third party, while 14 percent 
of male respondents sup-
ported Gary Johnson and 1 
percent of male respondents 
supported Jill Stein.
Unsurprisingly, female 
respondents were far more 
likely to select abortion as 
an issue that was important 
to deciding their vote. (74 
percent of females chose it, 
as opposed to only 32 per-
cent of male respondents.) 
Female respondents were 
also far more likely to select 
education, LGBTQ Rights, 
healthcare, guns, and stu-
dent debt as issues that 
were important to them. 
On the other hand, male 
respondents were signi?-
cantly more likely to select 
foreign policy/national se-
curity, jobs, taxes, and trade 
as important issues. Male 
and female respondents 
demonstrated nearly equal 
interest in criminal justice 
and energy/environmental 
issues.
There was a signi?cant 
enthusiasm gap between 
male and female Hillary Clin-
ton supporters. Of female 
Hillary Clinton supporters, 
82 percent expressed enthu-
siastic support, while only 
54 percent of males did. 
There was also an enthusi-
asm gap between male and 
female Donald Trump sup-
porters. Female Trump sup-
porters were equally likely 
to express “enthusiastic” 
and “reluctant” support for 
Donald Trump, but male 
Trump supporters were 
nearly twice as likely to ex-
press “enthusiastic,” rather 
than “reluctant,” support for 
their candidate.
Female respondents were 
also more likely to consider 
themselves to be “very lib-
eral” or “somewhat liberal” 
than male respondents, and 
were more likely to sup-
port Democratic Senate and 
House candidates.
A link to the online sur-
vey was posted in the Face-
book groups of the four 
Carnegie Mellon classes. 
The link was also released 
on The Tartan’s Twitter ac-
count. For unclear reasons, 
far more juniors answered 
the survey than members 
of the other classes, while 
sophomores were underrep-
resented. There were no sig-
ni?cant differences between 
the classes.
Questions about the 
surveys can be sent to 
zpg@thetartan.org.
The Tartan conducts exit surveys for 2016 presidential election
Most students surveyed 
were already in favor of Clin-
ton before they chose whether 
to attend a political event. 
Perhaps one of the few students 
to truly attend a live event 
for information was Victor 
Tavarez, a junior international 
relations and politics major, 
who attended a Trump rally to 
give the candidate a chance. 
However, he states “what I saw 
was pretty disappointing and 
[the supporters] received us 
with a lot of animosity.”
Most students also 
chose to register to vote in 
Pennsylvania instead of their 
home state, as they felt their 
votes mattered more here. 
Carnegie Mellon students 
come from a broad range 
of states across the country, 
many of which are already af-
?liated with particular parties. 
Students from New York, New 
Jersey, and California, states 
that tend to vote democratic, 
favored registering in 
Pittsburgh to give Clinton her 
much needed “blue wall” edge.
“I come from California so 
my vote doesn’t really matter 
there,” said Ben Snell, a senior 
art major. “I registered here in 
Pennsylvania and I felt so much 
more different and much more 
proud and important voting 
here.”
Participating in this election 
while living in a swing state 
has been an interesting expe-
rience for many Carnegie Mel-
lon students, to say the least. 
Pennsylvania is not just home 
to many universities and col-
lege-educated youth, but also 
to countless blue-collar lower 
class workers. With such a 
wide scope, how could a single 
candidate appeal to every de-
mographic?
Carnegie Mellon student 
Alex Hauschild has been pas-
sionate in attending Demo-
cratic National Committee 
(DNC) rallies, and has gone to 
hear Bernie Sanders, Michelle 
Obama, and Hillary Clinton. 
“I’ve been around,” he said, “ 
but it did not change my opin-
ion because I was always going 
to vote democratic. This elec-
tion is a lot like open heart sur-
gery, would you rather have a 
doctor with a malpractice suit 
or the manager of Wendy’s?” 
which is a reference to a popu-
lar internet meme.
Few people went out of 
their way to hear or listen to an 
opposing candidate, because 
ultimately, the waiting in lines, 
security, and capacity of rallies 
tend to pose an inconvenience. 
Russell Hawkins, a junior 
electrical and computer 
engineering major, supported 
this sentiment by sharing “I 
watched what I wanted to 
watch.” Moreover, students 
confessed that one would have 
to feel pretty strongly about ei-
ther candidate to subject them-
selves to the headaches of a 
political event. Henri Fitzmau-
rice, a ?rst-year drama student 
with Students for Hillary, felt 
that the rallies did serve a pur-
pose. “I work for the Clinton 
campaign, and I do think ral-
lies have had an effect in the in-
forming and attendance of col-
lege students. There’s always 
been massive over?ow.”
As for the next election 
cycle, whether Pennsylvania 
will remain a key state remains 
up in the air. Trump invested 
what seems minimal personal 
effort into reaching out to local 
voters but won the state, while 
Clinton invested millions of 
dollars and dispatched notable 
politicians only to win a few 
counties. This tactic, perhaps, 
was not as effective in the 2016 
election cycle.
Voters mostly admitted to 
having previously established 
decisions and identi?ed ral-
lies more as celebrity sightings 
than as informational events. 
In addition, ?rst time voters 
wanted their votes to matter, 
or at least have more weight 
than in their respective home 
states. So while Pittsburgh area 
campaigning might not have 
swayed individuals’ decisions, 
it certainly did encourage more 
people to get out and vote.
Students explain why campaigns didn’t impact their decisions

The Carnegie Mellon 
University International Film 
Festival is the only interna-
tional ?lm festival in the world 
run completely by students. 
Established in 2006 by the Hu-
manities Center at Carnegie 
Mellon University, the festival 
aims to expose the Carnegie 
Mellon and greater Pittsburgh 
community to ?lms which 
they otherwise may not hear 
about.
This year the festival will 
run from March 23 to April 
9, 2017. There will be 16 ?lms 
shown, with most of the ?lms’ 
directors available for Q&A 
sessions after the viewings. 
To enhance the experience, 
receptions following the 
showings will feature food and 
artistic performances from the 
?lms’ respective cultures. The 
?lm premieres often trans-
form into cultural celebrations 
as people come together to 
discuss both the ?lm and the 
culture it came from.
This year’s festival is built 
around the theme “Faces of 
Identity” which has become 
an increasingly signi?cant so-
cial issue in the recent past. 
The festival’s goal is to relate 
to the entire community by 
selecting ?lms from a global 
scale. Throughout the festival, 
students have the opportunity 
to become familiar with ?lms 
that are not blockbusters. 
Some of these ?lms have never 
been screened in Pittsburgh, 
which makes this event even 
more exciting.
The organization aims to 
bring the student body to-
gether by providing students 
with a space to explore vari-
ous cultures that are repre-
sented in the school commu-
nity. Megan Mell, a masters 
student in entertainment in-
dustry management, serves 
as the logistics coordinator 
for the festival. Mell stated 
in an interview with The 
Tartan that these ?lms “aim 
to stimulate conversations 
about who we are as people 
and as a community. The 
festival is perfect for starting 
conversations that are really 
important and may otherwise 
not occur.” She also added 
that the ?lms allow people 
from different backgrounds 
to “come together to watch 
these movies and discuss 
them after. It’s a very positive 
atmosphere.”
Outside of Carnegie 
Mellon, religious and social 
groups from the Pittsburgh 
area come together during 
past festivals to put differ-
ences aside and have mean-
ingful discussions. “Everyone 
is going through similar is-
sues and seeing these issues 
depicted in multiple ?lms 
forms a stronger sense of 
community,” Mell added.
Peter Geyer, a sophomore 
in business administration, 
stated in an interview that the 
?lms the organization screens 
“are rarely seen anywhere else 
in the U.S. and give people the 
opportunity to see stories from 
different international points 
of view, opening audiences’ 
eyes to issues and viewpoints 
they may have never known 
existed.”
On Nov. 18 at 6 p.m. there 
will be a sneak preview of the 
Film Festival where the ?lm 
Interrogation will be shown. 
Director Vetrimaaran will be 
present for a Q&A session after 
the showing. Interrogation has 
won many awards including 
Best Feature Film at the Indian 
Film Festival of Los Angeles 
2016, Best Feature Film in 
Tamil, Best Supporting Actor, 
and Best Editing at the Indian 
National Film Awards in 2016, 
and the Amnesty Internation-
al Italia Award at the Venice 
Film Festival in 2015. The ?lm 
tells a true story about human 
rights, police violence, and so-
cial injustice. Vetrimaaran is 
a critically-acclaimed Indian 
?lm director who produces 
under his own company, Grass 
Root Film Company.
Tickets for the screening 
are available online and cost 
$5 for students and $10 for 
general admission.

This article was meant to be a 
celebration. It was conceptualized 
last week when many of us thought 
the United States was on the cusp of 
electing its ?rst female president. We 
at The Tartan expected to be releas-
ing this issue in the afterglow of Hill-
ary Clinton’s success, and we wanted 
to use that success to call for even 
more progress, namely, an increase 
in the number of women serving in 
the president’s Cabinet. After the 
startling upset Tuesday night where 
Donald Trump was elected as the 
next president of the United States, 
there isn’t as much to celebrate. 
Trump’s victory can hardly be called 
a victory for feminism. Still, even un-
der President Trump, there is poten-
tially room for progress.
The ?rst woman appointed to the 
U.S. Cabinet was Frances Perkins, 
who served as Secretary of Labor 
from 1933 to 1945 under President 
Franklin Roosevelt and for a few 
months under President Harry Tru-
man. After Perkins’ appointment it 
was two more decades before an-
other woman was appointed to the 
Cabinet, this time Oveta Culp Hobby 
as Secretary of Health, Education, 
and Welfare. This set the pace for the 
slow, plodding progress women have 
made in this portion of the political 
sphere.
Female representation in the 
Cabinet peaked in the 1990s when 
President Bill Clinton appointed nine 
women as part of his Cabinet for his 
second term. Still, this only meant 
that 41 percent of the Cabinet was 
female, falling far short of the female 
share of the general population. 
Since Clinton’s presidency, the prog-
ress has stalled, with women only 
making up 19 percent of President 
George W. Bush’s ?rst Cabinet and 
inching up to 35 percent in President 
Barack Obama’s current term. This 
negative trend isn’t very promising 
for women trying to reach gender 
parity in the Cabinet any time soon.
Clearly, women are underrep-
resented in politics in general, and 
in the Cabinet speci?cally. But why 
does this matter? When Canadian 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was 
asked why he thought it was impor-
tant to appoint a Cabinet that was 
50 percent women at the start of 
his term, he responded, “Because 
it’s 2015.” Trudeau’s decision to pri-
oritize gender parity in his appoint-
ments was controversial, with some 
people claiming that it would require 
him to make incompetent appoint-
ments. This statement assumes that 
there are no, or signi?cantly fewer, 
women quali?ed for cabinet posi-
tions. Usually, people appointed to 
cabinet positions come from a back-
ground in politics, academia, or law. 
In the U.S, women made up 53.3 per-
cent of people with Ph.Ds as of 2010. 
As of May of this year women made 
up 36 percent of the legal profes-
sion. There are well-educated, quali-
?ed women out there who are being 
passed over due to our country’s leg-
acy of sexism.
Having gender parity in political 
bodies can have huge positive effects 
for a nation. Without adequate rep-
resentation, women are sidelined in 
the political sphere, with their voices 
only being heard through the ?lter of 
a male representative. Women have 
different experiences that tend to 
emphasize different priorities, and, 
according to Time magazine, coun-
tries with a representative gender 
distribution in their lawmakers tend 
to make more progress on issues 
such as education, labor-force par-
ticipation, and paid leave. Gender 
parity can also improve trust in gov-
ernment, something the U.S. is cur-
rently lacking, with surveys ?nding 
that both men and women view po-
litical institutions as more fair, legiti-
mate, and democratic when women 
are proportionally represented. Fi-
nally, putting women in positions of 
power can shift public perceptions 
of women in leadership, improving 
gender equality across the board.
Making signi?cant strides in one 
administration can have lasting ef-
fects. In 1986, the ?rst female prime 
minister of Norway, Gro Harlem 
Bruntdland, appointed a govern-
ment that was 40 percent women. To 
this day the government still re?ects 
gender parity, and women are now 
required by law to make up at least 
40 percent of corporate boardrooms 
in Norway.
The Cabinet is a particularly good 
place to push for women’s represen-
tation because it consists of appoint-
ed positions. Elected bodies in the 
U.S. are notorious for being male-
dominated. This happens for several 
reasons. First off, fewer women tend 
to run for of?ce or even consider run-
ning. Our society doesn’t tend to en-
courage women to run or to think of 
themselves as political leaders. Even 
once they decide to run, women tend 
to face an uphill battle against ste-
reotypes and gender-based double 
standards that have been discussed 
before in these pages. These barri-
ers make it very dif?cult for women 
to make progress in elected posi-
tions, and are why women made 
up only 19.4 percent of Congress in 
2015. In contrast, gender parity in 
the Cabinet only requires one person 
to realize the importance of female 
representation, and once women are 
in Cabinet positions they can start to 
break down some of the double stan-
dards surrounding women in power.
With a new administration com-
ing into power in January, a new 
Cabinet will have to be appointed 
along with it. Trump has an opportu-
nity to make a lasting positive change 
with his appointments. However, 
only four of the Cabinet positions 
even have women on his “short list” 
for the job, and of those it is unlikely 
that all four will go to female candi-
dates. Even if all four positions were 
?lled by women, Trump’s proposed 
cabinet would only be 17 percent 
women, a level that hasn’t been seen 
since President Jimmy Carter left of-
?ce in 1981. This would be an unac-
ceptable setback for gender parity, 
and something we the people must 
?ght to remedy before the Cabinet is 
set in stone.
CALEB GLICKMAN
Well, America. Here we are. Our 
18-month election nightmare is 
over. And for a majority of Ameri-
cans, a four-year nightmare has just 
begun. Before I respond to Staff-
writer Brandon Schmuck’s counter-
article in our ongoing discussion of 
the two-party system, I would like 
to start by addressing the events of 
Tuesday, Nov. 8.
Many people are angry. Many 
people are scared. Most are both, 
and understandably so. For these 
members of our society, this mo-
ment begins a dark chapter in our 
nation’s history. But there are sever-
al things that we need to clear up be-
fore crucifying any particular group 
about why this has occurred. 
We should not solely blame any 
one group. Voter turnout statistics 
show that while Latino voter turn-
out was high, Trump won a higher 
percentage than Romney in 2012. 
Black voter turnout was slightly 
lower, and Clinton won 5 percent 
less than Obama did in 2012. White 
voter turnout was high, and more 
non-college educated women voted 
for Trump than expected. In addi-
tion, Clinton did not win college-
educated women by the margin she 
was expected to. There are many 
reasons for this; some have specu-
lated that these women were reluc-
tant to discuss with pollsters their 
support for Trump given the media’s 
focus on his treatment of women, 
while others point to the population 
metrics of the polls themselves be-
ing incorrect. 
We should not solely blame the 
pollsters. While some gave Clinton 
overwhelming odds heading into 
the election, FiveThirtyEight’s fore-
cast had the odds at 65 percent to 35 
percent in Clinton’s favor two days 
before Election Day. These odds are 
lower than the Obama-Romney odds 
in 2012, and it is common for polling 
errors to account for such margins. 
Just because she was ahead does not 
mean that she was guaranteed to 
win. A 35 percent chance was high-
er than many were willing to admit. 
When it comes down to it, polling is 
a science that continues to improve 
with time and data. Polling can be 
helpful and inform our political un-
derstanding of an electorate. I do 
not believe for one second that we 
would be better off if we simply got 
rid of the pollsters. 
We should also not solely blame 
third-party voters. While a small 
percentage of votes were siphoned 
off by the Johnson and Stein cam-
paigns, it is safe to assume that not 
all of these votes would have gone 
to either major party candidate. The 
margins they won were not going to 
be enough to ?ip the states that Clin-
ton lost. 
We should also not believe, as 
some on the left have already hy-
pothesized, that Bernie Sanders 
could have done any better. It is un-
knowable how that race would have 
played out, but we do know from the 
primaries that he would have under-
performed with minorities, and that 
the GOP would have attacked him 
?ercely (which they never did dur-
ing the primary) with an anti-social-
ist ?restorm.
We should also not solely blame 
Trump supporters. They live in an 
America far different from the one 
in our university bubble. They chose 
to put certain things aside for their 
candidate, and people can (and 
should) criticize them for that. They 
did, however, send a clear message 
to Washington after being fed a par-
ticular narrative for years about the 
inability of our government’s elites. 
Whether the narrative is true does 
not matter to them, because elec-
tions are not won with facts alone — 
this one in particular.
Many of these factors came to-
gether to form a perfect storm. And 
while many people, including my-
self, are stunned by the result, there 
is one thing to take note: Clinton 
won the popular vote. 
For the sixth time in the last sev-
en races, Democrats have won the 
popular vote. Despite everything she 
had going against her, and Trump’s 
unexpectedly strong performance, 
the Democrats still won the popu-
lar vote. This reinforces something 
I described many weeks ago about 
how our country as a whole leans. 
I described it brie?y in my third ar-
ticle discussing the stress about the 
2000 election. A Republican won 
against the majority’s desires. That 
left our country divided and more 
partisan than before. But our nation 
as a whole has and always is shifting 
and evolving. We are still the same 
growing, diverse nation we were last 
week. 
If there is one ultimate culprit in 
this election, it is the Electoral Col-
lege. For the ?fth time in our history, 
the winner of the popular vote lost 
in the Electoral College. That is a 
failure rate of 9 percent in determin-
ing who is the leader of the country. 
I’ve written about the Electoral Col-
lege in the past, and unfortunately I 
would not get your hopes up about 
changing this system. It works to 
give more power to rural voters to 
balance out population centers, en-
suring a president has support from 
around the country. You can thank 
the Founders for that one. 
The most important thing to re-
member is that our country is rep-
resented by those who vote at all. 
If you did not vote, you do not have 
the right to complain about this out-
come. Your ideals will never triumph 
in an election if you do not express 
those ideals in the voting booth. 
This brings me to my response 
to Schmuck and his counter-article 
published last week. He reiterated 
his claim that voting your conscience 
may still be your best option, and 
that the two major party candidates 
were equally “terrible.” He also

In the weeks before its release, 
Marvel’s new movie Doctor Strange 
generated controversy and confusion 
surrounding its choice to cast Tilda 
Swinton, a white actress, in the role 
of The Ancient One, a character who 
was a Tibetan monk in the original 
comic series. Many people saw this 
casting choice as taking the role away 
from an actor of Asian descent and 
whitewashing the character.
Whitewashing is a term used to 
describe instances where ?lmmak-
ers (or theatre makers, or TV makers, 
etc.) cast a white actor to play a non-
white role. Essentially, a role writ-
ten as a person of color is given to a 
white actor, occasionally with some 
attempt at an explanation as to why. 
This usually happens when the ?lm 
is an adaptation of an existing story 
— as the character already exists as 
a person of color outside of the ?lm 
— but can happen in original stories 
if the character is written to be non-
white and yet a white actor is cast to 
play them as a non-white character. 
An example of the former is Johnny 
Depp playing a Native American in 
The Lone Ranger, and an example of 
the latter would be Emma Stone play-
ing a woman of Chinese and Native 
Hawaiian descent in Aloha.
There are three common argu-
ments as to why whitewashing is not 
a problem. The ?rst of these is the 
claim that the ?lm cast for talent, not 
race, and that the white actor play-
ing the character of color was simply 
better at it than the actor of color. 
Even ignoring the fact that, very of-
ten, ?lmmakers don’t even consider 
actors of color for main roles, this 
argument implies that white actors 
are not only generally better at pre-
tending to be a different person than 
actors of color, but that white actors 
are better at pretending to be a per-
son of color than actors of color are 
at actually being people of color. This 
is clearly ridiculous.
The second argument is that ?lm-
making is a business, and actors of 
color simply don’t earn as much box 
of?ce proceeds as white actors. If, 
again, we ignore the fact that in the 
Motion Picture Association of Amer-
ica’s Theatrical Market Statistics for 
2014, audiences of color bought 46 
percent of tickets sold despite being 
37 percent of the U.S. population, 
there is a point to be made here. Hol-
lywood, much like many other cul-
tural and political institutions, has 
dif?culty supporting people of color 
as much as it supports white people. 
If ?lmmakers truly wanted actors 
of color to rise to more prominence 
despite Hollywood’s inherent rac-
ism, then the ?rst 
step is to ?ght to 
normalize prominent actors of color, 
especially when casting characters 
of color.
The last argument is less of an 
argument and more of an attempt-
ed catch-22. Why is whitewashing 
considered such a problem when 
actors of color playing traditionally 
white characters is not? The answer 
is a matter of quality and quantity. 
There have always been more roles 
for white actors than actors of color. 
A study by two professors at the Uni-
versity of Southern California found 
that in the 700 top grossing ?lms 
from 2007 to 2014, an average of 25 
percent of actors were not white. This 
includes stereotypical portrayals as 
well as characters with virtually no 
screen time. Of the top 100 ?lms of 
2014, only 17 had a lead or co-lead 
actor of color. Not only do actors of 
color receive fewer 
roles than white 
actors, but the 
roles they do 
get are less complex, dynamic, and 
engaging. Taking roles away from 
actors of color compounds this fact, 
while giving them roles tradition-
ally played by white actors helps to 
remedy it.
Why is this lack of representation 
a problem, though? Multiple studies, 
including one from two University 
of Indiana professors, have shown 
that consistent exposure to media 
that lacks positive representation of 
black characters negatively affects 
the self-esteem of black children. 
Lowered self-esteem goes on to affect 
nearly every aspect of life, including 
impaired academic and job perfor-
mance and increased vulnerability to 
depression and substance abuse.
But let’s argue, for a moment, 
that you don’t care about any of 
this. Representation in media is 
unimportant to you, you don’t care 
about anyone’s self-esteem except for 
your own, and you just want superhe-
ro movies starring white guys named 
Chris to keep coming out without all 
these ‘social justice warriors’ com-
plaining about them.
A study published in the Journal 
of Applied Psychology found that 
exposure to characters in media as-
sociated with stigmatized or minor-
ity groups reduced prejudice towards 
those groups. The empathy that see-
ing complex representation of people 
other than ourselves cultivates is 
necessary for a just and equal society. 
Lack of empathy and understanding 
of marginalized groups only increas-
es that marginalization.
The media that a society creates 
and consumes shapes that society 
irrevocably. Media that reinforces 
negative stereotypes and fails to pro-
vide positive representation will cre-
ate a society that is not inclined to 
view people of color as complex, real 
human beings. Because Hollywood 
?lms are so prominent in our cultural 
consciousness, they have a huge ef-
fect on shaping the culture we live in.
Doctor Strange’s director, Scott 
Derrickson, has stated in an inter-
view with The Daily Beast that the 
role was given to Swinton because 
he “felt like [he] was going to be con-
tributing to a bad stereotype” by cast-
ing an Asian actor in a role related 
to mysticism and other Asian stereo-
types. This is, of course, an admirable 
goal. The way to combat stereotypes, 
however, is not by erasing them, but 
by negating them. A character is not 
a stereotype if they are complex and 
multi-dimensional, and the only way 
to refute stereotypes is to examine 
them and show why they are reduc-
tive and dehumanizing. The char-
acter of The Ancient One may have 
been an insulting stereotype in the 
original comics, but adaptations are, 
at their heart, a means to right the 
wrongs of the original story.
insinuated in his piece that I seem to 
have some covert goal of advocating 
for a Democrat-only government.
I am not going to take up more 
space debunking all of the claims 
that Republicans have already dis-
proven. The nine Congressional 
Benghazi investigations con?rmed 
there was no scandal, and the FBI 
investigations into emails found 
Clinton had not broken the law. This 
is the reality behind most Clinton 
“scandals” (ahem, Whitewater). And 
of course the Russian email hacks 
were designed to in?uence our elec-
tion in only one direction. 
I am not going to blame 
Schmuck’s ?rm libertarian ideology 
for swinging the election either; I ad-
dressed the third party vote earlier. 
And if he chose to vote, he has every 
right to complain about the Trump 
presidency as I do, because voting is 
the most patriotic thing a citizen can 
do in this country. 
However, I believe that Schmuck 
has forgotten what I was originally 
arguing for. He wrote that I have 
an agenda “not in promoting even a 
system of two choices, but one with 
what [Glickman] believes to be a 
clear-cut choice: Hillary Clinton or 
Hillary Clinton.”
My series of articles has been 
based around the argument in favor 
of a two-party system. The fourth 
article focused on the recent elec-
tion and how Trump has turned 
this system upside down and how 
Republicans and Democrats who do 
not align with him should still send 
him into the abyss. This is where 
Schmuck discerned my “clear-cut 
choice.” So yes, obviously, I was 
advocating for a candidate. That 
should not come as a surprise in an 
opinion column. 
Schmuck and I do agree on a fun-
damental problem with our govern-
ment that I touched on in earlier ar-
ticles: our partisanship has reached 
astronomical levels. 
It seems that, now with full Re-
publican control of our government, 
that partisanship is unlikely to less-
en. Expect Democratic ?libusters 
akin to those of the Republican ob-
struction under Obama. 
Still, I argue that the two-party 
system can work. It has worked. 
However, several things need to 
change for us to return to an age 
where conservative Democrats 
and liberal Republicans even exist. 
And many of these things involve 
you, reader. 
For one, try to take as many high 
roads as you can. As easy as it may 
seem, resist the urge to block your 
friends and relatives who supported 
the other candidate. This will only 
increase the problem of people get-
ting information from only one side. 
You have to be informed; seek out 
all paths of data and information to 
ensure a healthy exchange of ideas 
once again. Our country needs to 
realign itself, and you can play a 
signi?cant role in that. We have to be 
willing to talk politics and remain on 
good terms with our fellow students, 
friends and family when we disagree. 
There is not an easy road ahead 
for many people of color, non-
heterosexual orientations, or dif-
ferent nationalities. And what I am 
asking is not an easy task. But by 
defending the people who feel disen-
franchised by this election result, we 
can be pragmatic and realistic about 
returning to common sense in this 
nation. Many people have poured 
out their emotion and support for 
one another in the past week. 
It lifts me up to see people simply 
caring for one another, but our work 
has just begun. 
For those of you upset with this 
election, we cannot simply grieve and 
then accept defeat while the Trump 
administration follows through on 
any number of campaign promises 
sure to set our nation back decades. 
The most patriotic thing one can do 
is vote. The next most patriotic thing 
one can do is protest and organize. 
We must remain vigilant in remind-
ing Trump that a majority of the na-
tion is ready to oppose any illegal or 
retrograde actions. If we simply fall 
back into a complacent state of mind, 
then we are lost.
Our work has just begun.
And my heart is in the work.

posed to the completion of a multi-
billion dollar pipeline project that 
runs by the Sioux tribe reserva-
tion. In recent weeks the con?ict 
has turned violent as property has 
been destroyed and protesters have 
been arrested.
The project at the center of the 
controversy is the Dakota Access 
pipeline. The $3.8 billion project, 
upon completion, is intended to 
transport more than 450,000 gal-
lons of crude oil per day from North 
Dakota through South Dakota and 
eventually connect with an existing 
pipeline in Patoka, Illinois. The pipe-
line is to stretch 1,172 miles when 
completed, but has had to break 
from plan as protesters have squat-
ted on the public area.
Opponents of the project ini-
tially responded with litigation and 
quiet protest in an attempt to slow or 
halt the pipeline. The now roughly 
1,000 protesters, consisting of both 
Native Americans and activists, in-
cluding movie stars Mark Ruffalo 
and Shailene Woodley, assert that 
the pipeline threatens the safety of 
the only water supply for the area. 
Further, the commercial company 
behind the project, Energy Transfer 
Partners, is infringing on land that 
belongs to the local Sioux Tribe and 
threatening their public health and 
cultural resources. They view the 
pipeline as a continuation of the de-
cades of slights and torn-up treaties 
that Native American tribes have 
had to endure.
Supporters, on the other hand, 
claim that the risk of a leak is mi-
nuscule, and that the construction 
would create 8,000 to 12,000 addi-
tional jobs in the North Dakota area. 
In addition, observers attest that 
alternative energy sources are not 
realistic, and crude oil is the only 
practical solution. Finally, the pipe-
line would lessen U.S. reliance on 
foreign oil.
In recent days, Bearcat armored 
vehicles, tasers, bean bag shotgun 
rounds, and tear gas have been in-
troduced by law enforcement to at-
tack and quell the protesters. More 
than 400 of the protesters have 
been arrested.
Pittsburgh residents have recent 
history with Energy Transfer Part-
ners, the parent company heading 
the Dakota Access pipeline project. 
The company was responsible for a 
spill of 55,000 gallons of gasoline 
in the Susquehanna River last week 
threatening to contaminate the wa-
ter supply for all areas downstream.

The 2016 presidential primaries 
were bruising and probably left both 
parties more split and internally an-
gry than they were at the start. This 
has nearly always been the result of 
one-party primaries. To understand 
why they can have such an effect, it’s 
important to understand how they 
came to exist in the ?rst place.
During this election cycle, sup-
porters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-
VT) were planning to hold a protest 
near the Democratic National Con-
vention. Political pundits were saying 
this Democratic presidential primary 
had shades of the 1968 debacle which 
resulted in police violently putting 
down anti-Vietnam War protests and 
the selection of Vice President Hubert 
Humphrey, who had participated in 
zero of the 13 primaries that cycle.
Every political pundit who made 
that claim was completely wrong. 
The 2016 Democratic primary was 
divisive, but the 1968 Democratic 
National Convention was a tragedy.
With opposition to the Vietnam 
War growing, President Lyndon B. 
Johnson realized his political pros-
pects were dwindling after he only 
eked out a narrow victory over one 
of his ?ercest critics, Sen. Eugene 
McCarthy (D-MN), in New Hamp-
shire. Johnson exited the race, creat-
ing room for Humphrey and former 
United States Attorney General and 
then-Sen. Robert Kennedy (D-NY). 
Humphrey’s campaign actively pur-
sued delegates to the convention 
from states that held no primaries. 
McCarthy and Kennedy won six and 
four primaries, respectively, though 
Kennedy won most of the states 
where they were competitive.
Kennedy won his ?nal primary on 
June 4, 1968, taking a 4-point victory 
in a tightly contested race in Califor-
nia. The delegates committed to the 
three frontrunners were split; 561 
were committed to Humphrey, 393 to 
Kennedy, and 258 to McCarthy. Since 
1304 delegates were needed to win 
the nomination, this left a pathway 
for any of the three candidates to ?nd 
his way to the nomination.
After Kennedy’s victory speech at 
the Ambassador Hotel in California, 
he was walking to the press room 
when he was assassinated. Kennedy’s 
death stripped the Democrats’ anti-
Vietnam War contingent of its best 
chance to capture the nomination.
To make matters worse, anti-
Vietnam War protests were brutally 
put down by police of?cers outside 
the convention. This disturbed many 
of the people watching the conven-
tions at home and also exacerbated 
acrimony between the pro- and anti-
Vietnam War wings of the party.
As the convention came to a close, 
despite McCarthy gaining a plu-
rality of the vote in primaries and 
Humphrey gaining none, Humphrey 
ended up winning an overwhelm-
ing victory on the ?rst ballot. How-
ever, the campaign was never able 
to recover from the lack of support 
from the Democratic base, and Hum-
phrey ended up losing the electoral 
vote badly to Vice President Richard 
Nixon despite a near deadlock in the 
popular vote.
The Democrats then created the 
McGovern-Fraser commission to 
ensure that primaries would never 
result in such a blatant failure of 
democracy again. This commission 
wrote a series of rules designed to en-
sure fairer and more transparent se-
lection of delegates. Most states com-
plied by having primary elections to 
determine who they would send to 
the convention, leading to the mod-
ern primary.
The ?rst Democratic primary 
campaign in 1972 was nearly as bru-
tal as the lead up to the 1968 Demo-
cratic National Convention. Early fa-
vorite Sen. Edmund Muskie (D-ME) 
was sunk by a pair of articles in the 
Manchester Union-Leader, one of 
which was eventually attributed to 
the Nixon campaign, claiming that 
Muskie had insulted French Canadi-
ans, and the second amounted to a 
sexist attack on Muskie’s wife, claim-
ing that she drank and swore. The 
prominent Democrats left in the race 
traded positions as leaders at any 
time. Humphrey was able to win sev-
eral rust belt states, Congresswoman 
Shirley Chisholm (D-NY) managed 
to win the popular vote in New Jer-
sey even though zero delegates were 
at stake, and former Alabama gov-
ernor George Wallace backed off of 
his aggressive segregationist views 
and managed to stake a good posi-
tion for himself until he was shot and 
paralyzed from the waist down,

Last week, Governor Tom Wolf 
signed a law that prohibits any agen-
cy of the Pennsylvania State govern-
ment from contracting with any 
business that boycotts Israel. The in-
tention behind the law is to discour-
age businesses from participating 
in the “Boycott, Divestment, Sanc-
tions,” movement (BDS), which tries 
to put economic pressure on Israel to 
end its occupation of Palestine, put a 
halt to Israeli settlements on Pales-
tinian land, and cease its discrimina-
tory treatment of Palestinians. The 
law’s sponsor, Republican State Rep-
resentative Matt Baker stated, “This 
legislation makes it very clear that 
companies can either perform a BDS 
action or they can do business with 
Pennsylvania. However, they cannot 
do both.” This is the wrong move for 
Pennsylvania, for both practical and 
moral reasons.
First of all, this law doesn’t really 
make practical sense — it will be 
hard to implement and it could have 
unintended consequences down 
the line. In terms of implementing 
the law, how will Pennsylvania de-
termine if businesses with which it 
has contracts have boycotted Israel? 
Israel is not a large country, and 
there are certainly many businesses 
that contract with Pennsylvania 
that don’t do any business with Is-
rael, or even any international busi-
ness whatsoever. Under this statute, 
are these businesses boycotting 
Israel? If not, what’s the difference 
between a business that naturally 
doesn’t do business with Israel, and 
one that chooses not to do so? Why 
is one unworthy of doing business 
with Pennsylvania?
The law could also have unin-
tended consequences that will harm 
Pennsylvanians. A recent poll from 
Pew showed that American support 
for Palestine is on the rise, particu-
larly among millennials. This means 
that support for BDS is also on the 
rise, and more and more businesses 
will consider boycotting or divesting 
from Israel.
Already, major institutions like 
the Methodist Church, United Elec-
trical Workers Union, and Deutsche 
Bank have already boycotted or di-
vested from Israel. Even the United 
States government requires prod-
ucts from Israeli settlements to be 
labeled, a milder form of boycott. 
Pennsylvanians stand to miss out if 
major businesses choose to boycott 
Israel in the future, thus closing off 
their services to the Pennsylvania 
government.
Taxpayers might also end up 
paying more if Pennsylvania must 
contract with a more expensive 
business because its cheaper com-
petitor boycotts Israel. Pennsylvania 
has an obligation to its taxpayers 
to conduct its business in the most 
cost-effective and ef?cient way pos-
sible, not to put the needs of citizens 
after special interests and ideologi-
cal stances.
This law also has legal and moral 
issues. I’m not convinced that Penn-
sylvania has constitutional leeway 
to refuse businesses based on their 
political stances. Imagine if Penn-
sylvania passed a law stating that 
its government could not make 
contracts with businesses owned by 
Democrats. Surely even conserva-
tive Republicans would balk at such 
a statute. This law is no different, it 
discriminates against businesses for 
acting on their principles in a way 
that has no impact on Pennsylva-
nia or its citizens. Don’t business-
owners have a constitutional right 
to voice their opinions without be-
ing punished by their government? 
Shouldn’t the only factor that Penn-
sylvania considers when making 
contracts be prices and the quality 
of service? Governor Wolf justi?ed 
the law by saying, “We, as a Com-
monwealth, must make sure that 
Pennsylvania is not contributing to 
a cause that is antithetical to our 
country’s position on the world’s 
stage,” yet Governor Wolf had no 
problem signing a law legalizing 
medical marijuana this year, even 
though it directly contradicts federal 
law.
But this law is also the mor-
ally wrong choice for Pennsylvania. 
Rather than punishing businesses 
that practice BDS, Pennsylvania 
should join the ranks of the BDS 
movement, divesting all state funds 
from any Israeli businesses and 
boycotting all Israeli products, es-
pecially those made in illegal Israeli 
settlements. Governor Wolf said 
that Pennsylvania “will not encour-
age economic punishment in place 
of peaceful solutions to challeng-
ing con?icts.” I wonder if he would 
have said the same thing about 
companies that divested or boycot-
ted South Africa in the 1980s, or the 
Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1956. 
I wonder if he feels the same about 
sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North 
Korea today.
The truth is, we ought to use 
every peaceful tool at our disposal, 
including economic pressure, to dis-
mantle situations of injustice and 
oppression. Experts from Jimmy 
Carter to John Kerry have likened 
the Israeli-Palestinian con?ict to 
apartheid in South Africa and seg-
regation in the United States. Not 
only has Pennsylvania stayed on the 
sidelines rather than standing up for 
justice, with this law it has actively 
and willfully chosen the side of the 
oppressor.

It recently went public that a study 
on injectable hormone contracep-
tives for men was terminated early 
due to adverse side effects reported 
by a signi?cant number of men par-
ticipating in the study. These side 
effects included acne, injection site 
pain, increased libido, headaches, 
weight gain, and mood disorders.
The premature discontinuation of 
this study has stirred up a consider-
able amount of upset and has been 
receiving a great deal of critical press 
coverage the past few weeks. Women 
are infuriated by the fact that this 
study was halted, seemingly as a re-
sult of risk factors that women taking 
oral contraceptives are expected to 
tolerate as part of the cost of using 
this form of contraception.
After looking into the most recent 
study on male contraceptives and the 
history of the female birth control 
pill, I soon discovered statistics that 
are upsetting, unsettling, and high-
light blatant misogyny and the clear 
double standard that exists when it 
comes to hormonal contraceptive 
options.
Women’s health has been an im-
portant issue this past election sea-
son, and the results of the election 
have made many concerned that 
many women will no longer be able 
to afford birth control. Under Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s Affordable 
Care Act, female oral contraceptives 
dropped signi?cantly in cost, and, 
with some insurance coverage, have 
become free of cost. Donald Trump 
has promised to repeal the Afford-
able Care Act (ACA) during his ?rst 
one hundred days in of?ce, and with 
ACA will go inexpensive birth con-
trol options for women. So isn’t this 
all the more reason to look into new, 
alternative contraception methods?
The results of this most recent 
study, along with an explanation as 
to why the the study was terminat-
ed, were published in the Journal of 
Clinical Endocrinology and Metabo-
lism (JCEM) this past month. If you 
have the time, I do highly encourage 
you read the article, as it illustrates 
in greater depth many of the statis-
tics I highlight here. This publication 
indicates that although the drugs had 
a 95 percent ef?cacy rate, 65 of the 
913 participants (around 7 percent) 
reported the development of mood 
disorders soon after beginning the 
study.
However, none of these mood dis-
orders were described as “severe.” 
In fact, only two of these cases were 
considered “moderate,” and the oth-
er 63 were categorized as “mild.” It 
is also interesting to note that 62 of 
these 65 cases were all reported at 
the same center in Indonesia. During 
the course of this study there was a 
death by suicide of a single partici-
pant; however, his family stated that 
he had been diagnosed with depres-
sion prior to beginning the study and 
“he could not cope with his academic 
pressure,” essentially ruling out the 
conclusion that his death was in any 
way caused by the drugs he was be-
ing administered.
So why was the study canceled?
Well, two private safety commit-
tees deemed the study unsafe to con-
tinue because of the rate at which 
mood disorders were being reported.
I do not see a problem with the 
fact that the study was terminated 
due to the adverse side effects the 
participants were facing; however, 
I do have problem with the double 
standard this creates by default. A 
woman taking oral contraceptives 
faces the same risks these men faced 
in this study, yet it is commonplace 
for a woman to take a birth control 
pill in spite of these side effects.
It is interesting to look into the 
history of the birth control pill, 
particularly looking at preliminary 
studies in the 1950s with Enovid, the 
?rst hormonal birth control pill. Tri-
als were conducted in Puerto Rico in 
order to avoid American anti-birth 
control laws, and, within the ?rst 
few months, the study appeared to 
prove that the pill was 100 percent 
effective. However, there were so 
many adverse side effects that Dr. 
Rice-Wray, a female doctor working 
on the trails, wanted to discontinue 
the study.
Early on in the study two women, 
who appeared entirely healthy prior 
to taking Enovid, died of unknown 
causes, yet no autopsies were con-
ducted to determine the cause of 
death and the study was continued 
without hesitation.
This is what absolutely infuriates 
me: to say that the study on male 
birth control should not have been 
stopped because ones on female 
birth control were not is not the cor-
rect answer. Two wrongs do not make 
a right, but in the case of this most 
recent male hormonal contraceptive 
study, it was stopped abruptly af-
ter the death of a single participant 
whose death was entirely unrelated 
to the use of the drug.
People make the argument that 
the additional side effects of the 
drug are what caused the commit-
tees to halt the study, but, as already 
discussed, these side effects are the 
same ones that women who take 
birth control as part of their daily 
routine face. In fact, the “high rates 
of depression” which were reported 
during this study are markedly lower 
than the rate of depression reported 
by women on birth control.
While 30 percent of women taking 
oral contraceptives report depres-
sion, only 3 percent of men from this 
study reported depression.
In surveys conducted during and 
following the study on male hormon-
al contraceptive injections, nearly 90 
percent of couples involved in the 
study responded by saying that they 
would use the injections as a primary 
form of birth control should it be-
come available on the market.
So the problem is not with the 
participants as much as it is with the 
sponsors and donors for this research. 
When a sponsor pulls out funding 
halfway through a study there is no 
way a drug can be approved and mar-
keted. The study is terminated, and it 
goes back to square one.
As it is with most things, money 
is the issue, and people are not will-
ing to put the necessary money into 
research to improve contraceptive 
options for men.
Women’s health issues and con-
traception are a branch of health 
care that is expected to change tre-
mendously in the upcoming months, 
?rst and foremost from a ?nancial 
perspective. It will be interesting 
to see if these changes further in-
hibit research on male contraceptive 
methods or if they encourage such 
research.
I certainly hope the latter.

This past season, 271 football-
related concussions were recorded 
by the National Football League 
(NFL), one of the highest numbers 
documented in the past several 
years. Helmet-to-helmet contact ac-
counts for about one-third of these 
mild traumatic brain injuries. While 
more and more people become 
aware of the severity of concussions, 
medicine has no treatments and in-
terventions that could reconstruct 
severely damaged brains.
Now, it is a fact that football play-
ers are heavy men composed largely 
of muscle mass. With so much weight 
being thrown around on the ?eld, 
imagine the force that one player has 
when running directly at another — 
and the damage that it can do when 
all of that force is directed at the 
brain, our most vital organ! When 
we think of football players, the im-
mediate image typically conjured is 
an iconic American one, a picture 
of toughness and colossal strength. 
But in this vision we often forget that 
these ?gures of power, too, are sub-
ject to natural human frailty, some-
thing that cannot be conquered by 
physical feats and happens to be our 
greatest vulnerability.
The brain is our powerhouse, 
which makes it slightly ironic that 
it is such a fragile and sensitive cre-
ation. The brain is cushioned by 
cerebrospinal ?uid, and while this 
serves as a protective measure in the 
case of small impacts, when a much 
larger hit is sustained, it allows 
space for the brain to rock back and 
forth, causing repeated hits against 
the skull, effectively bruising the 
brain. At the same time, the brain 
also endures other types of motion 
– including twisting, pulling, and 
stretching forces, a result of the curi-
ous fact that, while the brain is be-
ing violently rocked, not every part 
of it moves at the same speed. These 
harmful forces can then cause tears 
in the nerve tissue, impairing 
its ability to communi-
cate through syn-
apses, or killing 
the nerve cells 
altogether. 
The extent 
of the injury continues in the days 
to come after the initial impact. The 
brain experiences various changes, 
including in?ammation and de-
creased blood ?ow that can lead to 
a decreased supply of oxygen and 
necessary nutrients and ions (key 
elements to recovery), which can in 
turn continue to lead to further cell 
death. In some cases, brain function 
can be restored to normal if it is left 
to heal. Other times, the damage can 
become permanent.
Relatively little is still known 
about concussions and traumatic 
brain injuries of their type, a result 
of the incredibly complex nature of 
the brain. The damage done by a 
concussion is usually not visible in 
most brain scans. The effects of a 
concussion vary from person to per-
son. There is no speci?c treatment 
that can be administered, other than 
time to rest to leave the brain to heal 
itself (though it is a fragile organ, it 
is at the same time remarkably resil-
ient). This includes restricted physi-
cal exertion and restricted mental 
activity, or, in extreme cases, sur-
gery. After sustaining a concussion, 
the most common symptoms include 
headaches, fatigue, decreased cogni-
tive function, dizziness, and a sensi-
tivity to sound and light. Typical pain 
relievers are ineffective in treating 
the pressing pain from headaches 
caused by concussions.
Two summers ago, I sustained 
a severe concussion while sur?ng 
after I was hit in the head twice, in 
the same place, by a surfboard. Two 
isolated, momentary events, ones 
that have impacted me in the follow-
ing months, going on years – and yet 
this impact was nowhere near the 
impact that football players often 
take. I experienced a large decrease 
in cognitive function, trouble with 
focusing my eyes, dizziness, and 
horrible headaches. To this day I still 
experience painful, localized head-
aches as a result of something called 
Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS), 
an umbrella term for the lasting 
symptoms even after the initial in-
jury component of a concussion has 
healed. I feel overwhelming fatigue 
when I study a lot, and I ?nd myself 
making stupid mistakes in areas I 
have never done so before. There is 
never any telling how long PCS can 
plague a person — and if I am still 
being affected over a year later, I can 
only wonder at the impact that an 
even more severe concussion from 
more force can have on a football 
player.
To add to the fact, football play-
ers in particular are incredibly sus-
ceptible to receiving not just one, 
but multiple concussions. Secondary 
concussions, especially if they occur 
before the brain has had the chance 
to reach a full recovery, can lead to 
life-long cognitive decline and dan-
gerous brain swelling that can even 
be life-threatening. It can also lead 
to a degenerative condition called 
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy 
(CTE) in which the brain experi-
ences atrophy, and massive amounts 
of cells die over time. Depending on 
the part of the brain, this can dra-
matically impact things such as bal-
ance, emotional control, judgment, 
and memory. It can even trigger a 
gradual onset of dementia. The even 
bigger issue? The symptoms of CTE 
bear resemblance to several other 
conditions, and CTE can only be di-
agnosed by examining brain tissue 
after death.
So here’s the upshot: if football 
players are particularly vulnerable to 
receiving concussions — to sustain-
ing injuries to the most important 
part of the body — and if we are 
so aware of it, why are they still on 
the rise? The best treatment for a 
concussion is to prevent one in the 
?rst place, so why aren’t more pre-
ventative measures in place? While 
players may participate in the sport 
for 20 or so years, those 20 years 
shouldn’t dictate their health and 
mental condition for the rest of their 
lives; those 20 years shouldn’t di-
minish the quality of their life for the 
next many decades.

ending his campaign. Somewhat 
hilariously, Sen. George McGovern 
(D-SD), chair of the McGovern-Fras-
er Commission which had written the 
rules for the primary, put together an 
anti-establishment campaign. De-
spite only coming in second in the 
popular vote, McGovern was able to 
secure the delegates necessary for 
the nomination.
McGovern’s views put him at odds 
with the party’s leadership, and left 
plenty of room for the Nixon cam-
paign to paint him as a left-wing 
extremist. Nixon won 49 states and 
cleared 60 percent in the popular 
vote, which no one has done since. 
The Democrats have still not put an 
“establishment” candidate in the 
White House since Johnson.
Primaries were so successful that 
the Republicans followed suit in 
1976, leading to a bitter contest be-
tween President Gerald Ford, who 
took over after the Watergate scandal 
forced Nixon out of of?ce, and former 
California governor Ronald Reagan. 
Though Ford won this round, he lost 
the general to Georgia Governor Jim-
my Carter. Reagan came back with a 
vengeance in 1980, crushing social 
and foreign policy moderate, former 
CIA Director George H. W. Bush and 
unexpectedly steamrolling President 
Carter. Reagan’s brand of movement 
conservatism permanently derailed a 
shift of the Republican Party towards 
the center and inspired a generation 
of rock-ribbed conservatives that be-
gan to take control of the government 
in the Republican Revolution in 1994 
and continues to control most seats 
in local, state, and federal govern-
ment. Even Bush and his son, George 
W., governed from a position closer 
to Reagan’s than their own.
The erosion of entire ideologies 
like Bush’s within parties is the natu-
ral result of primaries. When a candi-
date only has to appeal to voters who 
will not only vote for one party, but 
show up to low-turnout primaries to 
do so in order to gain the nomination, 
that candidate has a new generic vot-
er to consider. A Republican needs to 
win the average Republican, not an 
average voter, before participating 
in a general election. The same goes 
for Democrats.
Most general elections for local 
and state representatives, the House 
of Representatives, and even the Sen-
ate are so lopsided that winning the 
primary might as well be a free pass 
to the contested of?ce. Our State 
Senator from Allegheny County, Jay 
Costa, ran unopposed. No Republi-
can would have a chance of taking 
him down right now. This is true for 
many electoral districts in the na-
tion. While the divide between urban 
and rural voters creates a lot of these 
differences, some congressional dis-
tricts are drawn to concentrate one 
party’s votes into a single district, 
an act known as gerrymandering. 
This creates districts that are nearly 
impossible to wrest from the other 
party. This disenfranchises people in 
those districts in the minority party 
because they cannot help select the 
candidate that will get an automatic 
win. This happens in statewide elec-
tions, too. While 34 Senate seats 
were up for grabs on Tuesday, fewer 
than 10 were considered competitive.
This means people getting elected 
don’t even have to consider the ideas 
of the other side. If they do, they risk 
losing their jobs. Bipartisanship is 
a major target, and candidates like 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) are excori-
ated for daring to reach across the 
aisle. If working with the other side 
will alienate your only constituents 
who matter, why do it?
With elections so focused on one 
ideology, it makes it easy for politi-
cians to win by actively trashing the 
other side. Negative campaigning is 
very effective, so when you don’t even 
have to think about Republicans to 
win your election, why not drag them 
all through the mud? It’s an easy way 
to score political points. This broken 
incentive system leads to extreme an-
ger at the other party. When voter’s 
local of?cials are so hell-bent on the 
idea that the ?gureheads of the op-
posing party are directly causing 
their economic anxiety, voters are 
going to wonder who on earth could 
possibly back those monsters.
Getting rid of primaries entirely 
could result in a repeat of 1968, but 
this incentive system that has led to 
brutal levels of political polarization 
needs to be broken.
One of two systems could break it.
The ?rst would be instituting a 
single transferable vote or ranked 
choice vote for all candidates who 
have entered into an election with 
no primaries. For example, in this 
election, Hillary Clinton, Donald 
Trump, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, 
Gary Johnson, and all of the other 
candidates would all be on the same 
ballot and voters would rank all 
of them. Whoever won the ranked 
choice vote would win. This means 
that candidates would have to appeal 
to all segments of the population in 
order to gain popularity on the bal-
lot. Further, while some people fear 
that this would be unfair to the party 
with more candidates, as rounds go 
on, those extra candidates will be 
the ?rst one dropped from the ballot 
and their votes will probably disperse 
more heavily among the candidates 
in their own party than the other.
The second, which could be use-
ful considering how technically dif?-
cult that ?rst method of voting could 
be on a scale as grand as the United 
States, would be top two primaries. 
Again, every candidate would appear 
on the same ballot in the primary, 
and two would come out on top 
and contest the general one on one. 
Parties would be forced to thorough-
ly vet their candidates, lest they split 
their own party’s votes.
Both of these systems give candi-
dates an incentive to move towards 
the ideology of their whole region in-
stead of just the dominant one. They 
disincentivize the hardline partisan-
ship that has become an increasingly 
prominent feature of our politics 
since primaries were created. This 
could help to heal the vicious divides 
that have left our country protracted 
battles that end in unproductive leg-
islative sessions and bitter feelings.
This “anti-establishment” wave 
taking over the world and culmi-
nating in the stunning election of 
Donald Trump on Tuesday night is 
a very real existential threat. It re-
jects global norms because they are 
removed enough from people’s lives 
to be painted as a convincing villain. 
The policymakers whose incom-
petence does cause the trials and 
tribulations of people continue to 
retain their obscurity and keep their 
popularity where it needs to be by 
toeing the party line at every turn. 
Primaries make for fun news cycles 
sometimes, but must be eliminated 
for the government to respond to all 
of its citizens and function at some 
acceptable level.

Teachers play vital role in polarization
Other voting methods could end primaries, salvage democracy

Somewhere at a high school in 
America, there is a student sitting at 
a desk, eagerly awaiting today’s lec-
ture. The teacher walks to the front 
of the room, takes a deep breath, 
and then says “before I begin today, 
there is an issue I need to address.”
But it turns it out, it wasn’t even 
an issue. Instead, the teacher pro-
ceeds to give a pitch for their po-
litical candidate. The student who 
moments ago was excited to learn, 
slouches in their seat a little. This 
student doesn’t support this candi-
date, and looks around the room to 
see if others feel the same.
Instead, almost all the students 
nod their heads in agreement with 
the teacher, especially when this 
teacher makes a derogatory com-
ment about those on the other side 
of the political spectrum.
The student who was eager to 
learn now dreads every day they 
will have to spend in this class, fear-
ful that speaking their opinion will 
cause the teacher to view them in 
a negative light. The student who 
once valued learning above all now 
becomes a reluctant participant 
in discussion.
This is happening to students all 
across the country. It happens every 
week, if not every day. I know be-
cause it happened to me.
It is a teacher’s job to educate 
their students. It is their job to en-
sure that students become citizens 
who are civically responsible, and to 
inform them of political issues. High 
school students should be taught 
both sides, and middle ground, on 
“hot button” political issues our na-
tion faces today, such as gun control, 
health care, and abortion.
Research by social learning theo-
rist Albert Bandura has shown that 
children are likely to imitate the be-
havior of others and therefore likely 
to share the political beliefs of adults 
in their life. Given that children 
spend most of their time at school 
and home, they are then highly like-
ly to share the political views of their 
parents and teachers. 
Furthur research by psychologi-
cal researcher Judith Harris shows, 
however, that children often deviate 
from their parents’ political views 
after leaving home if their parents 
share extremist views and often 
talk politics. 
This change in political af?lia-
tion is due largely to the fact that 
these are children are more likely to 
engage in political discussions and 
are then exposed to different points 
of view on issues that they simply 
did not know about before.
But imagine if we exposed these 
children to different political opin-
ions from the beginning. Exposing 
children to differing views allows 
them to form their own beliefs, but 
this needs to be done in an inclu-
sive environment. An environment 
where “liberal” or “conservative” 
isn’t equivalent to a dirty word, 
where “Democrat” or “Republican” 
is simply a self-descriptor and not 
an indication of who you are as a 
person. Not only does this allow stu-
dents to form beliefs that they may 
not have otherwise, but it teaches 
them compromise. By having teach-
ers foster discussion, they can be 
sure that these conversations are 
held as more of a debate than an 
an argument. Doing this will un-
doubtedly create more politically 
engaged, considerate citizens, es-
pecially in a time when America is 
more polarized than it has been for 
over a century.
While introducing students to 
viewpoints from across the political 
spectrum, it is important that teach-
ers do not discuss their own political 
opinions. They should, in no way 
whatsoever, try push their politi-
cal beliefs onto their students. They 
should generate discussion, and ad-
dress the opposing side (whether 
they believe in it or not) if no stu-
dents seem to acknowledge it. Had 
my teacher, after stating that “there 
was an issue that [he] need[ed] to 
address,” proceeded to have an open 
discussion about the upcoming elec-
tion, it would have been a differ-
ent day for everyone. I would have 
been exposed to a different view in a 
more inclusive environment, and my 
classmates would have been as well. 
The teacher could have ensured that 
our conversation stuck to policy and 
did not get personal, and I would 
have been in a classroom of students 
debating the issues. An entire class-
room could have learned a different 
opinion and how to compromise 
that day.
But we didn’t. It’s important that 
this generation grows up learning 
how to have a civil discussion and 
how to debate without personally 
attacking their opposition. It lies in 
the hands of high school teachers 
today to allow their students to ex-
plore political issues in an unbiased 
manner, creating a generation of 
free thinkers that will help keep this 
country great.
Bigotry, in shadows since Obama’s election, comes to light with Trump’s
SAHANA THIRUMAZHUSAI
Junior Staffwriter
Since the election last week, the 
country has been full of heated argu-
ments on the President-elect. Many 
of those upset with the outcome have 
taken to the streets protesting, while 
others use social media to share their 
opinions. Race, religion, and identity 
have all played major roles in many 
of these interactions.
One particular idea keeps being 
repeated online: this idea of a “lib-
eral bubble” that has now been bro-
ken, that the protesters are ?nally 
seeing what the world is like and are 
now appalled. However, for most of 
the people upset about this election, 
these results aren’t showing them 
something new. Rather, it’s a huge 
blow against an already failing hope 
for this country to not allow bigotry.
Eight years ago, when Barack 
Obama was elected President of the 
United States, I was in sixth grade. 
Until then, I had always accepted 
that if I wanted to, I could run for 
President. It wasn’t really a dream, 
but rather something that was just 
known. If you were born in the U.S, 
you worked as hard as you could, and 
you tried to be a good person, you 
could be president. A simple view on 
the issue, de?nitely, but the kind el-
ementary school kids often hold.
Sure, no one who had ever looked 
like me had been President. No wom-
an, and certainly no one brown. But 
that didn’t bother me. I knew how 
the Constitution worked. There was 
an inherent equality to it all, and I 
loved it.
When I ?rst learned about Presi-
dent, then Senator, Obama, I felt so 
many emotions. I was amazed that 
he was running, and charmed by his 
hope. Politicians had mainly existed 
in the abstract. I knew I had sena-
tors and representatives and may-
ors, but I didn’t know much about 
them. President Obama was real and 
exciting. He represented something 
so much bigger than just one elec-
tion. It was about change.
Yet, for all the excitement he 
brought, the campaign of President 
Obama began to reveal a darker side 
of this nation, an intolerance with an 
unexpected intensity.
I was born in the U.S., and 
throughout my life, I had never ques-
tioned my identity as an American. 
But when I saw the brilliant senator 
get attacked for not being a “real” 
American, I began to doubt myself. 
Because of the color of his skin, Pres-
ident Obama was attacked. 
If a man that inspiring could be 
distrusted because his middle name 
was Hussein, why would anyone 
trust me, with a last name no one 
could pronounce? He did not look 
the way Americans should, and so he 
was ridiculed.
It wasn’t just his skin color. He 
was accused of being Muslim, and 
there was an implied statement that 
being Muslim was an unacceptable 
trait for a President. There were ru-
mors of how he was a terrorist.
No one expected the election of 
the ?rst non-white president to go 
smoothly. But since the beginning, 
the level of dissent against Presi-
dent Obama that has its roots in his 
heritage, rather than his policies, has 
been high. Racist caricatures, jokes 
rooted in stereotypes — everything 
seemed to be fair game. The prestige 
and sanctity of the presidency didn’t 
seem to extend to President Obama. 
Even his family was open to the same 
types of attacks.
There were always going to be 
groups that were unhappy about 
President Obama. The Ku Klux Klan 
wasn’t supposed to be ecstatic about 
the new president. But instead of 
a historic presidency that brought 
people together, what was created 
instead was an environment where 
anything was okay. Photoshopped 
jokes comparing Obama to a monkey, 
or calling for him to be lynched have 
somehow entered the public sphere. 
People hid behind the First Amend-
ment, claiming that political correct-
ness was destroying America.
Racism existed before President 
Obama. It was widespread and hor-
rendous. It did not just start again 
because of President Obama. How-
ever, for so many people, the elec-
tion of a black president was meant 
to herald the beginning of a differ-
ent time. It was supposed to mean 
that equality was a legitimate part of 
American life. Instead, it meant that 
there was a new central target, a po-
larizing ?gure.
Since that election, race-based 
issues have become more relevant. 
The Voting Rights Act was repealed. 
Police brutality has become a divi-
sive issue in many cities. Black Lives 
Matter has become a national move-
ment. All of these issues bring up dis-
cussion that is now tinged with racial 
slurs, among other things. Bigotry 
has been expected.
The 2016 election cycle only ex-
empli?ed this more. The man who 
pushed the birther movement to new 
levels in 2011 is now our president-
elect. He has made comments dis-
paraging a judge based on race and 
has promised a ban on Muslims en-
tering the country.
When Donald Trump was elected, 
it added a certain credence to the 
words he spread.
The people who are dismayed 
about the election of Trump aren’t 
overreacting. Rather, the election of 
a man who spews awful comments 
is the culmination of what people 
have heard for a long time. For far 
too many Americans, racism isn’t a 
worthwhile problem. It’s easily out-
weighed by many other things. The 
protests of this election are about 
more than just the results — they’re 
about a loss of faith in the ability of 
Americans to see the racial problems 
that besiege this country.
It is a teacher’s job to educate their 
students. It is their job to ensure that 
students become citizens who are 
civically responsible, and to inform them 
of political issues. High school students 
should be taught both sides, and middle 
ground, on “hot button” political issues.

In today’s media-run 
world, Bluetooth technology 
surrounds us in our cars, in 
our pockets, and on our ears. 
With its beginnings rooted in 
the ‘90s, back when people 
used Nokia 9000s, Bluetooth 
has revolutionized the way de-
vices communicate wirelessly. 
With Bluetooth, we can wire-
lessly play music on speak-
ers from our phones, transfer 
photos between devices, and 
so much more. The Bluetooth 
Special Interest Group origi-
nally consisted of ?ve com-
panies: Ericsson, IBM, Intel, 
Toshiba, and Nokia. Now, it 
has over 20,000 member com-
panies, and its growth does 
not show signs of stagnat-
ing. Bluetooth is a wireless 
technology standard used to 
exchange data across devices 
in close proximity. To commu-
nicate, industrial, scienti?c, 
and medical devices (ISM) 
send short-wavelength radio 
waves across 79 designated 
Bluetooth channels on the 
globally unlicensed ISM radio 
frequency band. It is inex-
pensive, automatic, and low-
energy. Even with Bluetooth 
running in the background 
of a smartphone, the battery 
is hardly drained. The most 
recent Bluetooth standard, 
version 4.2, has a theoretical 
maximum speed of 25 mega-
bits per second (Mbps) and a 
theoretical maximum range of 
100 meters, or 330 feet. The 
upcoming version, 5.0, will 
have a theoretical maximum 
speed of 50 Mbps and a theo-
retical maximum range of 800 
meters, over 2600 feet. Blue-
tooth allows for eight devices 
to be connected at once, and 
the devices can automatically 
detect each other. Each Blue-
tooth device has a small com-
puter chip with a Bluetooth 
radio and software. Communi-
cation between devices occurs 
over networks called piconets, 
or personal-area networks 
(PAN) — individual networks 
of devices connected using 
Bluetooth protocols. One of 
the devices becomes the “mas-
ter,” and all other connected 
devices act as “slaves.” A mas-
ter and a slave could switch 
positions, too; the positions 
are not rigid. Moreover, while 
the master can have multiple 
slaves, as of right now, slaves 
cannot have more than one 
master. This type of network 
is called an ad-hoc computer 
network — it is spontaneous, 
decentralized, and does not 
rely on a pre-existing infra-
structure of hardware.
Bluetooth uses a radio 
technology called frequency-
hopping spread spectrum in 
which transmitted data is di-
vided into packets, and each 
packet is transmitted on one 
of the 79 channels. There are 
“even slots” and “odd slots” of 
time in which a packet can be 
transmitted. For single-slot sit-
uations, the master transmits 
data in even slots and receives 
in odd slots, while the slave re-
ceives in even slots and trans-
mits in odd slots. So, if there is 
more than one slave, how does 
the master transmit packets to 
all? Using an algorithm called 
round-robin scheduling, the 
master handles each slave 
without priority in a circular 
order, and switches rapidly 
between devices; transmit-
ters change frequencies 1600 
times per second. The specs 
of Bluetooth technology elimi-
nate the problems of infrared 
wireless technology, which 
television remotes use. First, 
Bluetooth does not need the 
devices to be in each others’ 
lines of sight, contrasting with 
how we need to point televi-
sion remotes at the television 
for them to work. The devices 
only need to be visible in a 
quasi-optical wireless path, re-
ferring to an invisible network 
in which two things are in the 
same region. Second, Blue-
tooth works across multiple 
devices at the same time, as 
mentioned before.
While the impacts Blue-
tooth has had on our society 
are far from simple, Bluetooth 
protocols operate with the ide-
als of simplicity and low cost. 
As the technology advances, 
the effects it has will only be-
come more widespread and 
crucial to our daily lives.
Deteriorating plastics hinder seabird scavenging
Plastics are contained in 
every disposable product 
imaginable, and when we 
throw such products away, 
some inevitably end up in the 
ocean, where they are broken 
up into “microplastics” by ul-
traviolet radiation, waves, 
and other factors. Seabirds 
are skilled at managing to 
?nd food — krill and other 
related crustaceans — in vast 
areas of open ocean, but they 
have been found to consume 
microplastics as well. A new 
study by two scientists at the 
University of California, Da-
vis, found that seabirds have 
a strong sense of smell and 
use the smell of dimethyl sul-
?de to ?nd their prey. This 
is a chemical released when 
phytoplankton gets broken 
down or eaten, a signal to 
the birds that the predators 
of the phytoplankton — krill, 
for instance — are likely to 
be nearby. In the study, after 
small plastic beads had been 
in the ocean for several weeks, 
dimethyl sul?de was found at 
high enough concentrations 
that seabirds could mistake it 
for food. This has implications 
for the health of the marine 
ecosystem in general, not just 
the seabirds, since other ani-
mals may use similar methods 
to ?nd food in the ocean.

Dr. John Roberts, organic chemist, passes away
John D. Roberts, an organic 
chemist and professor at Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology, 
passed away of a stroke at age 
98 on Oct. 29.
Roberts was responsible for 
using nuclear magnetic reso-
nance spectroscopy and other 
techniques to study the way 
atoms rearranged themselves 
in chemical reactions, which 
played an important role in 
the ?eld of physical organic 
chemistry. His studies have 
paved the way for the com-
mercial development of many 
organic compounds, rang-
ing from drugs to synthetic 
clothing ?bers.
Besides opening up our 
understanding of organic 
chemical reactions, Roberts 
also popularized the use of 
isotope tracers in studying 
reactions and wrote about 
molecular orbital theory.
Roberts won several 
awards for his work, includ-
ing the National Medal of 
Science in 1990. Yet, despite 
all of these accomplishments, 
he claims the best thing he 
did in his decades at Caltech 
was to spearhead the effort to 
make Caltech coed in order to 
bring one of his female gradu-
ate students with him from 
Harvard.

Trump election may mean exacerbated climate change
The election of Donald 
Trump likely means the unrav-
eling of environmental regula-
tions that intend to stave off 
dangerous anthropogenic cli-
mate change. The President-
elect has called global climate 
change “a hoax created by 
and for the Chinese in order 
to make U.S. manufacturing 
non-competitive.” He has also 
tapped Myron Ebell, a lead-
ing climate-change skeptic, 
to lead his Environmental 
Protection Agency transition 
team. Trump has also prom-
ised a return of the U.S. fossil 
fuel industry at the expense of 
current environmental regula-
tions, and has proposed that 
the U.S. decrease its payments 
to United Nations climate 
change programs. The Presi-
dent-elect has also vowed to 
scrap the Paris Climate Agree-
ment. Even if every other 
country did its part, the agree-
ment would not be able to pre-
vent the planet from warming 
more than 3.6 degrees Fahr-
enheit in the next few decades 
without the U.S., the second 
largest carbon emitter. Beyond 
this point, scientists warn we 
could irreversibly damage the 
planet and disrupt weather 
patterns, leading to more 
droughts, stronger storms, 
and agricultural disruptions.

Narwhals use echolocation to navigate in dark
For years, many scientists 
have been puzzled about how 
narwhals, whales with long 
tusks native to the frigid, ice-
strewn waters of the Arctic 
Ocean, are able to locate ?sh 
and other prey in the dark 
waters of the ocean and ice 
cracks in the surface in order 
to breathe. 
Scientists understood that 
whales often use echolocation 
rather than vision to navigate, 
so they planted special under-
water microphones to listen to 
narwhals.
The study found that nar-
whals use clicks of sound in-
audible to our ears at rates of 
up to 1,000 clicks per second 
to scan their environment. The 
waves will bounce back when 
they hit an object, signaling to 
the narwhal that there is an 
obstacle. 
Narwhals may also be able 
to narrow and widen their 
beams at different stages of 
tracking their prey.
Narwhals seem to be able 
to produce an acoustic image 
of a resolution higher than any 
other animal, except possibly 
beluga whales. 
As for the single tusk that 
de?nes male narwhals, it seems 
to be for mating displays only 
and not any sort of “antenna.”

Tsunami caused by volcano near Santorini revisited
Santorini is a volcanic 
island near Greece, and in 
the 17th century B.C. during 
the Late Bronze Age, it was 
the home of the Akrotiri civi-
lization. The region was later 
destroyed when a nearby vol-
cano erupted in what was es-
timated to be one of the most 
powerful eruptions of the last 
10,000 years with a volcanic 
explosivity index of 6–7. It 
caused a tsunami, a factor that 
enabled outside invaders to 
come and conquer the region. 
Before, it was thought that 
the tsunami was the result of 
a caldera collapse, which is 
when the region above a mag-
ma chamber collapses down-
ward during an eruption, dis-
placing enough water to cause 
a tsunami. 
But new data shows that 
the caldera was not under-
water at all, so the tsunami 
could not have been triggered 
by such a collapse. Pyroclastic 
material up to 200 feet thick 
was found located just off the 
island, however, giving rise to 
the new theory that pyroclas-
tic ?ows were responsible for 
the tsunami. Since pyroclastic 
?ows are extremely hot and 
can move extremely fast, they 
are able to transfer that en-
ergy to the ocean and create 
a tsunami.

New Delhi closes schools due to air pollution
Recently, the government 
of New Delhi, India took 
the drastic step of closing 
1,800 public primary schools 
due to dangerous levels of 
air pollution.
Many people blamethe in-
creased air pollution on ?re-
crackers and ?reworks set off 
during the Diwali celebration.
Levels of the most 
dangerous particles, known 
as PM 2.5, reached about 600 
micrograms per cubic meter in 
parts of the city, exposure to 
which is equivalent to smok-
ing 40 cigarettes in one day.
The particles can penetrate 
the lungs and bloodstream, 
increasing the risk for asth-
ma, pneumonia, stroke, and 
a variety of other conditions. 
Children have experienced 
eye irritation, coughing and 
congestion due to the pollu-
tion, and the pollution has 
been particularly bad this past 
week due to the stagnant air 
over the city.
Parents were advised to 
keep children indoors, but, 
unfortunately, the air quality 
indoors is generally no better 
unless the windows and doors 
are shut and sealed.

RoboVote service helps facilitate group decisions with AI
JULIA EVE NAPOLITANO
SciTech Editor
Whether it’s the 
presidential election or decid-
ing what toppings to order on 
pizza, group decisions can be 
dif?cult. However, researchers 
at Carnegie Mellon University 
and Harvard University have 
created a nonpro?t academic 
project called RoboVote that 
uses arti?cial intelligence 
(AI) to make optimal group 
decisions. According to their 
website, RoboVote “builds 
on research conducted over 
decades in the multi-agent 
systems community, which 
aims to facilitate collective 
decision making among au-
tonomous software agents via 
computational social choice.”
The service was created 
by Ariel Procaccia, an assis-
tant professor in Carnegie 
Mellon’s Computer Science 
Department and an af?li-
ated faculty in the Machine 
Learning Department; Nisarg 
Shah, who previously earned 
his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mel-
lon under Procaccia and is 
currently a postdoctoral fellow 
at the Center for Research on 
Computation and Society at 
Harvard University; Phillip 
Wang, a Carnegie Mellon ?rst-
year in computer science; and 
Brian Merlob, an independent 
researcher in Silicon Valley.
“We’re leveraging the latest 
work in optimization and AI 
to help people make deci-
sions in their daily lives,” said 
Procaccia in a university press 
release. “We have taken what 
years of research have proven 
to be the best algorithms for 
making collective decisions 
and made them available with 
an interface that anyone can 
use.”
RoboVote uses two 
fundamental algorithms, 
which depends on whether 
the poll is subjective or objec-
tive. For subjective preferenc-
es, the team uses an approach 
called implicit utilitarian vot-
ing, whose goal is to maximize 
utilitarian social welfare, or 
the total utility assigned to the 
outcome by all participants. 
In order to minimize a par-
ticipant’s cognitive burden, 
the team asks for a ranking of 
alternatives.
For objective opinions, the 
team again uses ranking of al-
ternatives to pinpoint a list of 
options that is closest to the 
true ranking, as determined 
by the available information 
and the relative quality of the 
alternatives. The difference 
between an alternative’s rank-
ing and true ranking is known 
as the Kendall tau distance, 
which describes the number 
of disagreements. The service 
then selects the ranking that 
minimizes the Kendall tau dis-
tance for each alternative.
RoboVote’s algorithms are 
very vigorous, and they seek 
solutions that are the closest 
to the truth.
“In political elections, we 
know the voting rules are not 
good, but they are dif?cult to 
change,” Procaccia said in a 
university press release. “In 
computational social choice, 
however, we can build systems 
like RoboVote and implement 
the rules we think are best.”

Developing   an arti?cial

one of this century’s most am-

every crevice of daily life as we

they have also pondered the 
ethical challenges accompa-
nied by any such an invention. 
Like any other tool with 
incredible power, AI presents 
equally lucrative bene?ts and 
dismal chaos, depending on 
how it is made and applied. 
In fact, premonition of 
AI is everywhere in popular 
culture, spawning prevalent 
apocalyptic stories set often in 
dystopian worlds such as the 
Terminator series where the 
omni-present arti?cial gen-
eral intelligence system Sky-
net ?ghts the near-extinction 
human race, and the chilling 
futuristic opera 2001: A Space 
Odyssey in which the protago-
nist’s spaceship’s AI control 
system HAL goes rogue. De-
spite their differences, these 
two ?lms have one thing in 
common: unethical AI.
Predictably, these ethical 
concerns found their way to 
Carnegie Mellon University. 
On Nov. 1, U.S.-based inter-
national law ?rm K&L Gates 
Foundation made a dona-
tion to further research in the 
ethics of AI at the university. 
The endowment, worth $10 
million according to a Carn-
egie Mellon press release, 
will materialize in the form 
of the K&L Gates Endowment 
for Ethics and Computational 
Technologies research center.
This donation is most 
appropriate for this research 
university. Carnegie Mellon 
hosts cutting-edge research 
in computer science, robot-
ics and AI, so the K&L Gates’ 
Presidential Fellowship En-
dowment Fund will aid two 
research professors and three 
doctoral students in research 
concerning computational 
technology ethics. The K&L 
Presidential Scholarship Fund 
and the annual K&L Gates 
Prize will be awarded to ex-
ceptional undergraduates in 
the ?eld.
This endowment will be 
used to launch an internation-
al biennial conference that will 
allow academics and policy-
makers to come together and 
discuss critical issues, share 
research and raise awareness 
among the public. 
Carnegie Mellon president 
Subra Suresh admitted in an 
article by The New York Times 
that, “We are at a unique point 
in time where the technology 
is far ahead of society’s ability 
to retain it.” K&L Gates’ chair-
man Peter J. Kallis echoed 
Suresh’s sentiments, saying, 
“Law and technology converge 
at a profoundly 21st century 
challenge: how to de?ne the 
ethical boundaries of arti?cial 
intelligence.”
Kallis appropriately refers 
to AI as a challenge. Many re-
alize the immoral practices 
AI could perform or aid if left 
unchecked. Speci?c areas of 
concern include user privacy, 
robot rights, and transpar-
ency. The apprehension is 
what inspires open-source 
research organizations dedi-
cated to establishing the best 
practices for AI, like OpenAI 
and Partnership on AI — the 
collaborative coalition of tech-
industry competitors Google, 
Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, 
and IBM.
AI evolved from science 
?ction and theory to foresee-
able reality in recent decades, 
thanks to crucial innovation in 
computing technology. The in-
ternet and big data, along with 
faster and cheaper processing 
hardware, grant computer 
scientists access to extensive 
resources which are essential 
for AI experimentation to be 
remotely possible. 
Yet, despite ardent 
research, AI itself is still hard 
to de?ne. This can be attrib-
uted to factors including our 
nebulous understanding of in-
telligence and consciousness. 
According to Computer-
World, AI is the sub-?eld of 
computer science whose “goal 
is to enable the development 
of computers that are able to 
do things normally done by 
people — in particular, things 
associated with people acting 
intelligently.” 
These intelligent attributes 
include decision making, vi-
sual learning, pattern recogni-
tion, heuristics, and inference. 
1940s philosopher and math-
ematician Alan Turing devel-
oped the well-known Turing 
test for AI, also known as the 
imitation game. If a human 
holds two conversations, one 
with another human and one 
with a machine, and cannot 
tell which conversation is with 
whom, then the machine is 
deemed arti?cially intelligent.
AI has abundant uses in 
society. Currently, the most 
ubiquitous application to 
emerge from it is machine 
learning, which enables a 
computer to learn from expe-
rience, without intervention 
from its programmer. Machine 
learning is already in?uential 
in millions of users’ everyday 
interactions with technology; 
social networks, like Face-
book, Pinterest and Tumblr, 
employ machine learning to 
sort feed content according to 
what users would be most in-
terested in. 
Furthermore, corporations 
use it to display advertise-
ments that re?ect a user’s 
spending or browsing hab-
its — these programs need 
only receive enough data to 
heuristically learn from it. 
AI’s potential does not end 
there. Once strong AI is tan-
gible, it may be incorporated 
into autonomous vehicles, the 
internet of things, digital per-
sonal assistants, and warfare.
This century’s techno-
logical future is inevitably 
intertwined with AI. It is not 
a matter of ‘if’, but ‘when’ 
the computer that thinks 
will eventually be ingrained 
in all aspects of life. Clearly, 
policies concerning AI’s use 
and treatment are essential 
to protecting user and robot 
interests from mishap or cor-
porate and institutional gain, 
and K&L Gates’ donation is a 
prudent step.
Computer simulation used to study viral capsid breakage 
NAVIYA SINGLA
Assistant SciTech Editor
Markus Deserno, from 
Carnegie Mellon’s Depart-
ment of Physics, and Chris-
tine Peter, from the University 
of Konstanz in Germany, led 
a research team that devel-
oped a method to study the 
structure of viral capsids, the 
protein shell that houses the 
virus. The team used multi-
scale modeling to understand 
the molecular assembly of the 
viruses and proteins by break-
ing the capsid apart. This re-
search was published in The 
European Physical Journal 
Special Topics.
Viruses are essentially 
just genetic material (RNA 
or DNA) enclosed in nano-
containers made of protein, 
called viral capsids. Given the 
limitations of genetic mate-
rial carried by a virus, viruses 
encode for a small number of 
proteins to form round, sta-
ble, crystal-like structures on 
repeated combination. 
This process of self-
assembly of the capsid is ex-
tremely rapid and takes place 
on a microscopic scale of 30 to 
50 nanometers, which makes 
it hard to study using current 
microscopic methods. 
Thus, Deserno and Peter’s 
team used computer simu-
lation to ?rst construct the 
model of a viral capsid and 
then break it apart to under-
stand capsid assembly.
In a university press 
release, Deserno said, “The 
concept of breaking some-
thing to see how it’s made 
isn’t new. It’s what’s being 
done at particle accelerators 
and in materials science labs 
worldwide — not to mention 
by toddlers who break their 
toys to see what’s inside.” He 
explains, “with a simulation 
we can build the virus, crush 
it and see what happens at a 
very high level of resolution.”
In the study, the research 
team studied the stability of 
the capsid of a particular vi-
rus called Cowpea Chlorotic 
Mottle Virus (CCMV) using 
a coarse-grained simulation 
model of the virus. They me-
chanically compressed the 
virus in the simulation, then 
studied the location and se-
quence of breakage events 
and the change of interactions 
between the forces that hold 
the proteins together. 
In the paper, they say that 
this method, though very 
similar to the Atomic Force 
Microscope (AFM), provides 
a better resolution of the lo-
cation of the capsid breakage 
than what is possible with the 
AFM model. 
The study also creates a 
hierarchical model of assem-
bly order based on “binding 
strength and mechanical sta-
bility.” This order suggests 
a likely model for the com-
ponents of viral capsids that 
assemble before others, thus 
giving a fair idea of what the 
intermediates look like.
This research could be used 
to identify the factors that are 
responsible for structuring 
the viral unit, and therefore, 
can help to provide a greater 
understanding of the effect of 
drugs on the mutation of this 
unit. For instance, researchers 
are looking into combating 
the Hepatitis B viral infection 
by creating a drug that inter-
feres with the virus’ capsid 
assembly process.
Another application of this 
information, as mentioned in 
their paper, is to engineer cap-
sid proteins to build “contain-
ers” to encapsulate chemicals 
for targeted drug delivery.
The research concludes 
that the bonds that break 
?rst are the ones that form 
last during capsid assembly. 
During the assembly process, 
the proteins form pairs called 
dimers, where ?ve proteins 
meet or hexamers of dimers, 
where six proteins meet. 
They found that hexamers of 
dimers broke before pentam-
ers of dimers, which implies 
that hexametric contacts are 
weaker. 
This, in turn implies that 
hexamers of  dimers are not 
formed in the preliminary 
stages of assembly and sheds 
some light on the order in 
which intermediates of viral 
capsid structures are formed.

The Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus was studied using computer 
simulation, which determined that the bonds that form last break ?rst.

Thrilling week nine for The Tartan fantasy football league
INDIA PRICE
Online Editor
I would just like to start 
off by happily acknowledging 
that I am not this week’s big-
gest loser. After remembering 
at the last minute that ?ve of 
my players had bye weeks, 
I had to scramble to make 
ends meet. I picked up play-
ers I knew nothing about and 
set my lineup based on noth-
ing but projected scores, and 
I prayed for this best. I was 
lucky enough to play Forum 
Editor Sinead Foley’s What is 
going on?, who I believe forgot 
to set her line up. I came out 
on top, despite not breaking 
100 points, and despite having 
a score that would’ve lost to 
any other team in the league. 
So here’s to being the second 
worst ... again. Now let’s dive 
into the week nine recap.
Plaidie Daddies over What is 
going on? 97–86
Week nine proved to be a 
tough week for both my own 
Plaidie Daddies and Foley’s 
What is going on? Foley’s run-
ning backs and wide receivers 
de?nitely underperformed. 
Carolina running back Jona-
than Stewart only managed to 
rush the ball for four points, 
and Detroit wide receiver 
Marvin Jones only managed 
to throw up one point for Fol-
ey. Jacksonville quarterback 
Blake Bortles did his part, 
however, and brought in 21 
points. 
I owe my victory to my 
quarterback and wide re-
ceiver, Buffalo’s Tyrod Taylor 
and Baltimore’s Mike Wal-
lace, respectively. Despite the 
win I still suffered a pretty low 
score, thanks to the Titan’s 
defense that brought me in an 
astounding -7. The good news 
is that this was the ?rst week 
the Plaidie Daddies maxi-
mized their players and didn’t 
leave any points on the bench, 
although I de?nitely should’ve 
benched the Titans. Even so, I 
ended the week on top.
Dreamland Warriors over 
extremely dank team 
135–110
This matchup was one I 
was particularly excited to see 
unfold. It was Sports Editor 
versus Assistant Sports Editor. 
Wood’s extremely dank team 
versus Tanaya’s Dreamland 
Warriors. Though both teams 
fought hard and served up re-
spectable performances, poor 
performances from Seattle 
running back Christine Mi-
chael and Dallas wide receiver 
Dez Bryant likely cost Wood 
the win. Wood’s team did put 
up two 30-point scores how-
ever, from New Orleans run-
ning back Mark Ingram and 
Seattle tight end Jimmy Gra-
ham, but it wasn’t enough to 
top the Dreamland Warriors’ 
135 points. Top performances 
from Tanaya’s team included 
24 points from New Orleans 
quarterback Drew Brees and 
31 points from Oakland run-
ning back Latavius Murray, 
who ran the ball for 114 yards 
and three touchdowns against 
Denver.
McManus’s Anus over Mass-
hole Knickerbockers 114–108
Another exciting week nine 
matchup was between McMa-
nus’s Anus and the Masshole 
Knickerbockers. It was Pub-
lisher Sarah Gutekunst versus 
former personnel manager 
Lula Beresford, best friend 
versus best friend, and it was 
a close one. Even with strong 
performances from Tampa Bay 
quarterback Jameis Winston 
and Jacksonville wide receiver 
Allen Robinson, the Masshole 
Knickerbockers couldn’t make 
up for the one-digit scores 
from Baltimore running back 
Terrance West and Minne-
sota tight end Kyle Rudolph, 
who only managed to bring 
in 3 and 7 points respectively. 
The matchup eventually went 
to McManus’s Anus, whose 
quarterback, Russell Wil-
son of the Seattle Seahawks, 
landed two touchdowns and 
282 total yards over Buffalo 
for 26 points. Other notable 
performers from Gutekunst’s 
team included 21 points from 
Indianapolis running back 
Frank Gore and 11 from Den-
ver kicker Brandon McManus.
DeMarco DePolo over 
Loquacious Losers 197–114
One word — wow. Layout 
manager Zeke Rosenberg’s 
team, DeMarco DePolo, played 
a fantastic week of football. 
With two players scoring in 
the 30s and all but the Vikings 
defense throwing up double 
digits, it was impossible to 
beat DeMarco DePolo. San 
Diego running back Melvin 
Gordon had a stellar perfor-
mance, running the ball over 
190 yards for 35 points. Tampa 
Bay wide receiver Mike Evans 
had an even better week, com-
pleting 11 receptions for 150 
yards and two touchdowns, 
for a total of 38 points for De-
Marco DePolo. Pillbox editor 
Abhishek Tayal’s Loquacious 
Losers put up an admirable 
?ght with the help of Atlanta 
wide receiver Julio Jones, who 
brought in 25 points for Tayal. 
But with a majority of scores 
in the low- to mid-teens, it 
wasn’t enough to keep up with 
Rosenberg, who nearly broke 
200 points.
Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood 
over How does this work? 
152–119
This was a tough week 
for Foley, whose How does 
this work? lost to operations 
manager Jade Crockem’s Mr. 
Rodgers’ Neighborhood, af-
ter already suffering a loss 
to the Plaidie Daddies. How 
does this work? saw strong 
performances from Detriot 
wide receiver Golden Tate, 
and Minnesota wide receiver 
Stefon Diggs, who scored 24 
and 22 points respectively. 
It unfortunately wouldn’t be 
enough to top Crockem’s 152 
points. Green Bay quarterback 
Aaron Rodgers, Dallas run-
ning back Ezekiel Elliot, New 
Orleans wide receiver Michael 
Thomas, and Dallas tight end 
Jason Witten all brought in 
over 20 points each for Mr. 
Rodgers’ Neighborhood. Week 
nine also saw a solid 15-point 
performance from Kansas 
City kicker Cairo Santos who 
kicked for four ?eld goals and 
an extra point, scoring 13 of 
the Chief’s 19 points in a win 
over Jacksonville.
We’ve got four weeks left 
in the regular season, and 
some teams have set them-
selves apart as forces to be 
reckoned with in the coming 
weeks. Rosenberg’s DeMarco 
DePolo and Tanaya’s Dream-
land Warriors both boast 6–3 
records. Crockem’s Mr. Rod-
ger’s Neighborhood, in ad-
dition to also having a 6–3 
record, is also in command of 
a three game winning streak. 
And don’t overlook Gutekunst, 
whose McManus’s Anus is hot 
off of a four game winning 
streak. 
A matchup to keep an eye 
on this week is Crockem ver-
sus Wood, as both are look-
ing to roast each other over a 
win. Tune in next week for the 
week 10 recap.

College football’s champi-
onship system can be cruel. At 
the end of 12 games, only four 
teams can ?nd their way into 
the playoff. With so few games 
to make a statement, one slip-
up can completely derail a 
team’s hopes of lifting the Col-
lege Football Playoff National 
Championship Trophy come 
January. This week, three of 
NCAA Division I’s top four 
teams suffered brutal blows 
to their playoff hopes — a loss 
with a couple games left to go 
in the season to regain their 
footing and standing in the 
eyes of the selection commit-
tee.
Second-ranked Clemson 
with their high-octane of-
fense was the ?rst to suffer a 
loss and probably has no hope 
of playing for a title after the 
University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) 
vanquished them in a shoot-
out. Neither team was ever 
able to pull away by more than 
one score, as both defenses 
seemed helpless to stop the 
other from marching down 
the ?eld. Clemson quarter-
back Deshaun Watson put up 
580 passing yards, good for 
the Atlantic Coast Conference 
record, while Pitt put up over 
300 yards in the air and over 
150 on the ground.
Clemson was the ?rst team 
to draw some semblance of 
separation. They were lead-
ing 21–14 when Pitt quarter-
back Nathan Peterman put 
up a jump ball down the right 
sideline for tight end Scott Or-
ndoff, which Orndoff hauled 
in and took to the house. Pitt 
wasn’t able to convert the ex-
tra point, so when Clemson 
scored touchdowns on either 
side of the half, they went 
up by eight points, meaning 
Pitt would need a two-point 
conversion to tie the game 
if they couldn’t put together 
consecutive scoring drives 
without intervening points by 
Clemson. Pitt ?nally went for 
those two points after running 
back James Conner cut to his 
right and broke a tackle in the 
back?eld to score and shrank 
the gap to 42–40 in the middle 
of the fourth quarter. They 
were unable to convert, giv-
ing Clemson the ball and the 
opportunity to try to run the 
?ve remaining minutes off the 
clock.
Clemson came close to 
successfully putting the game 
away. They marched from 
their own 23-yard line into 
Pitt territory, taking just over 
four minutes off the clock. 
After a completion to set up 
a third down and one situa-
tion for Clemson, Pitt’s rush 
defense, which held up nicely 
throughout the game, stopped 
Clemson running back Wayne 
Gallman for no gain on con-
secutive plays, giving the ball 
to their offense in good ?eld 
position, needing just a ?eld 
goal to take the lead. Pitt took 
52 seconds to drive down the 
?eld, setting up a long ?eld 
goal for kicker Chris Blewitt, 
who split the uprights to give 
Pitt the win.
Pitt became the ?rst un-
ranked team to top Clemson 
in ?ve years. Fourth-ranked 
University of Washington 
struggled to put up yards 
against 20th-ranked Univer-
sity of Southern California 
(USC) and eventually was 
outgained 400–276. Wash-
ington’s non-existent running 
game allowed USC to commit 
to the pass, leaving little space 
for Washington quarterback 
Jake Browning, who threw 
two interceptions, including 
one with four minutes remain-
ing in the game that effective-
ly ended Washington’s hopes 
of coming back.
Washington and USC trad-
ed ?eld goals in the middle of 
the ?rst quarter, but Brown-
ing’s interception on the en-
suing drive turned into a USC 
touchdown, putting USC up 
10–3. 
This lead was never relin-
quished. Washington and USC 
exchanged a ?eld goal and a 
touchdown, respectively, and 
Washington went into the half 
down by 11.
Washington threatened to 
tighten the gap early in the 
second half. Browning found 
wide receiver John Ross all 
alone down the left sideline 
for a 70-yard touchdown. USC 
quarterback Sam Darnold 
threw an interception on the 
next drive, and Washington 
was set up to kick a 38-yard 
?eld goal that would bring 
them within one. This kick 
was blocked and the ball was 
returned to USC’s 40-yard 
line, setting up a touchdown 
drive by USC and restoring the 
lead to 11. Washington never 
got back within one score, and 
USC took home the upset.
Third-ranked University of 
Michigan was the last of the 
top-four teams to suffer a loss 
on Saturday night. The Michi-
gan offense let the defense 
down, averaging merely four 
yards per pass and less than 
three yards per rush. The of-
fense also gave up a safety 
when they left University of 
Iowa defensive lineman Jaleel 
Johnson essentially unblocked 
on a run from their own goal 
line that turned out to be the 
difference between a win and 
a loss. Michigan got off to a 
good start and led 10–0 by the 
middle of the second quarter, 
but that lead quickly faded. 
One drive after relinquishing 
a safety, the Michigan offense 
stalled deep in their own ter-
ritory and ended up giving 
the ball to Iowa near mid?eld. 
Iowa took advantage of the 
?eld position and scored their 
?rst and only touchdown of 
the game. They failed to con-
vert the 2-point play, but hit a 
?eld goal on the ?rst drive of 
the second half to put them 
up 11–10. After Iowa took the 
lead, Michigan would only top 
25 yards on one drive, a 60-
yard ?eld goal drive to open 
the fourth quarter, putting 
Michigan up 13–11. With 1:49 
left in the game, it seemed like 
Michigan would be able to 
hang on for the victory when 
they took over possession on 
their own 16-yard line. How-
ever, their offense was unable 
to make any meaningful prog-
ress, and Iowa’s remaining 
timeouts kept nearly a minute 
and a half on the clock when 
they got the ball back. A face-
mask penalty on the punt gave 
Iowa the ball on Michigan’s 
36-yard line. Iowa was able 
to put together a short drive 
to get into ?eld goal position, 
setting up kicker Keith Duncan 
to put the game away on a 33-
yard ?eld goal.
All three teams have reason 
to worry about their playoff 
standing with just a few games 
left in the season. Washing-
ton’s loss to USC was ugly and 
they looked overmatched all 
throughout the game.
Clemson and Michigan 
lost by one point on last-
second ?eld goals, but the 
selection committee won’t 
take the losses to unranked 
teams very lightly, especially 
with Clemson’s loss coming 
at home. Michigan will have 
the best shot at redemption 
when they travel to Columbus 
to play Ohio State, the cur-
rent ?fth-ranked team, in two 
weeks. Clemson’s win over 
sixth-ranked Louisville earlier 
in the season may help keep 
them a?oat, but late losses 
could stick out in the selec-
tion committee’s minds when 
they go to decide the regular 
season’s titans.

Tartan football wins All-Academic Bowl for second year
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
This Saturday, the Carn-
egie Mellon football team 
traveled to Cleveland, Ohio to 
face off against Case Western 
Reserve University in the 31st 
Annual Academic Bowl. The 
game counted toward stand-
ings in both the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
and the President’s Athletic 
Conference (PAC), and the 
Tartans were victorious for 
the second year in a row and 
the 10th time in the history of 
the matchup, taking the game 
26–21. The thriller of a game 
saw junior running back Sam 
Benger become Carnegie Mel-
lon’s all-time leading rusher, 
with 4,243 yards so far in his 
career. The win puts the Tar-
tans’ ?nal regular season re-
cord at 7–3, with a 6–2 record 
in the PAC and 2–1 in the UAA.
Even though the Tartans 
were victorious by the game’s 
end, it started off with Case 
Western Reserve setting the 
tone. After what would end 
up being the longest drive of 
the game for either team, the 
Case Western Spartans com-
pleted an 11-yard touchdown 
pass and the extra point to 
take the ?rst lead of the game. 
They continued to hold that 
lead until a few minutes into 
second quarter, when the Tar-
tans ?nally found the rhythm 
in their offense with a rela-
tively fast drive. They charged 
down the ?eld in just under 
two minutes, and eventually 
found the endzone with the 
help of a four-yard pass from 
sophomore quarterback Alex 
Cline to senior running back 
Zach Cree. This score and the 
ensuing extra point tied the 
game at 7–7 and the Tartans 
saw their chance to take over 
the game and take down the 
then-undefeated Spartans.
On the Tartans’ ?rst drive 
of the second half, they used 
up almost four full minutes of 
game time while driving 59 
yards down the ?eld, capped 
off by a 21-yard ?eld goal 
from senior placekicker Gabe 
Renna. This score gave the 
Tartans their ?rst lead of the 
game at 10–7, but they weren’t 
even close to done scoring. It 
took the Tartans almost ?ve 
minutes to regain possession, 
but once they did they scored 
almost immediately. Benger 
found a hole in the Spartans’ 
defense on a run play with 
six minutes left in the third 
quarter, and he was off to the 
races to put the Tartans up 
17–7. At this point it seemed 
like Carnegie Mellon would 
continue to steamroll the op-
position, but Case Western 
Reserve had other ideas. With 
just under four minutes to play 
in the third quarter, the Spar-
tans put together an explosive 
drive of their own and found 
themselves in the endzone af-
ter a 37-yard run. This score 
brought the Tartans’ lead to 
only three points, and it was 
anyone’s game at this point.
The fourth quarter was 
quite similar to the previous 
quarter, with both teams trad-
ing scores while the Tartans 
maintained their small lead 
from Renna’s earlier ?eld goal. 
Carnegie Mellon was the ?rst 
to strike in the fourth quarter 
with a quick drive that lasted 
only one and a half minutes 
but ended with a one yard run 
from Benger for his second 
score of the game and the ?-
nal touchdown of the game 
for the Tartans. The Spartans 
then had to ?ght against a 
formidable Tartan defense to 
move the ball down the ?eld 
on their next drive. They did, 
but it took twice the plays and 
twice the time of the Tartans’ 
previous score. The Spartan 
running back punched it in 
from the one-yard line, but it 
still wasn’t enough to put his 
team in the lead or even tie the 
game. 
The Tartans held on for a 
little bit more with the score at 
24–21. That would be the ?nal 
score of the game for the Spar-
tans, but the ?nal nail in the 
cof?n came with 17 seconds 
left in the game as the Tartans 
corralled their opponent into 
their own endzone and even-
tually came up with a safety by 
senior defensive lineman Jack 
Fagan for an extra two points. 
When the clock ?nally ticked 
down to zero, the Tartan side-
line erupted in celebration, 
and with good reason. After 
a hard-fought game against 
a previously undefeated 
opponent, the Tartans ?nished 
their season on a high note. 
Benger ended the game 
with 158 rushing yards on 31 
carries, and junior wide re-
ceiver John Prather led the 
receiving core with 178 yards 
— his ?fth 100-yard perfor-
mance of the season. He also 
broke the school record for 
single-season receiving yards 
with 1,011 on the season. 
Cline recorded 266 yards and 
a touchdown of his own while 
completing 19 of 29 passing 
attempts. Cree also ?nished 
with a career-best ?ve catches 
for 49 yards along with his 
touchdown.
Stanley Bikulege led the 
defense with 13 tackles and 
one sack, while senior Brian 
Khoury and junior Kyle Brit-
tain each had nine tackles. 
Khoury also recorded a sack, 
a forced fumble, and a fumble 
recovery, and his counterpart 
in the secondary, senior Samer 
Abdelmoty, had an intercep-
tion at the end of the game to 
put it away for good.
The Tartans may be able 
to continue their season if the 
Eastern College Athletic Con-
ference (ECAC) selects them 
to be a part of the 2016 ECAC 
Division III Football Fest. That 
announcement is set to take 
place on Monday, Nov. 14 at 
12 p.m. For now the Tartans 
can take a breather and appre-
ciate their hard work.
Men’s soccer ?ghts through second round to end seasonCross country runners earn bid to national tournament

This weekend, Carnegie 
Mellon University hosted the 
?rst and second rounds of the 
NCAA Division III Men’s Soc-
cer Championship. On Friday, 
the 18th ranked Carnegie 
Mellon men’s soccer team 
faced off against the Ohio 
Wesleyan Battling Bishops in 
the ?rst round of the tourna-
ment. 
The game started quickly, 
with Ohio Wesleyan scoring 
in the fourth minute to take 
the early lead. The Tartans 
immediately fought back, 
pushing their offensive attack 
into Ohio Wesleyan territory, 
with two shots on goal that 
were saved by the opposing 
goalkeeper. After trading sev-
eral possessions, a penalty 
kick attempt awarded to the 
Tartans resulted in a goal by 
junior Jimmy Jameson in the 
20th minute, tying the game 
at 1–1. Both teams created 
chances and each had a shot 
on goal that was saved by the 
goalkeeper. Ohio Wesleyan 
found their way into Tartan 
territory on several occa-
sions, but was unable to break 
through Carnegie Mellon’s 
defense. The Tartans played 
aggressively, maintaining 
possession in Battling Bishops 
territory. First-year Elliot Co-
hen scored in the 39th min-
ute with an assist from senior 
Devin Keane who entered 
the game less than a minute 
before. The goal brought the 
score to 2–1 and gave the 
Tartans the lead, which they 
would not relinquish.
The second half of the 
game was scoreless. Carnegie 
Mellon almost scored in the 
half but the call was reversed 
as the player was offsides. 
The Tartans had some great 
looks and several chances to 
widen their lead, but Ohio 
Wesleyan fought back. The 
Battling Bishops had two cor-
ner kicks late in the second 
half, but did not capitalize on 
their chances to tie the game. 
The game ended in a victory 
for the Carnegie Mellon team, 
who moved on to the second 
round of the tournament the 
next day. 
Saturday’s second round 
game of the NCAA Champion-
ship against the 16th ranked 
Calvin College Knights began 
slowly, with neither team 
scoring in the ?rst half. The 
Tartans had many opportu-
nities to score, with multiple 
shots that went just wide. 
Sophomore Zack Masciopinto 
had two shots on goal, both of 
which were saved by Calvin’s 
goalkeeper. Consistent play 
on both sides of the ball led to 
a 0–0 score at the end of the 
?rst half. 
The second half began as 
the ?rst half did, with the Tar-
tans and the Knights both cre-
ating chances to score. After 
receiving a corner kick, Calvin 
players made a series of head-
ers that ended in a header 
goal, bringing the score to 
1–0. The Tartans nearly tied 
the game twice, with one shot 
hitting the post and the other 
stopped by Calvin’s goalkeep-
er. The Tartans’ offense drove 
into Calvin territory several 
times, with quick runs and ef-
?cient passing. As opposed to 
the Knights’ only shot on goal 
in the game that resulted in 
the goal, the Tartans had ?ve 
shots on goal, but were un-
able to score. The game ended 
with the 1–0 score, as the Tar-
tans fell to the Knights in the 
second round of the NCAA 
Championship.
The Calvin Knights ad-
vance to the third round of 
the NCAA Championship as 
the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team ends its 2016 sea-
son with a 13–4–2 record.

The Carnegie Mellon 
University men’s cross coun-
try team has reason to cele-
brate this week, because they 
were given an at-large bid to 
the 2016 NCAA Division III 
Men’s Cross Country Cham-
pionships. It is the largest and 
most important tournament 
in NCAA Division III, so the 
stakes are high and the play-
ers are excited. With this bid, 
the Tartans will be attending 
the tournament for the third 
straight year, and for the 
10th time in the last 12 years. 
Success has been a tradi-
tion for the Carnegie Mellon 
cross country team, and that 
doesn’t look to be changing 
this year. 
On Saturday Nov. 12, the 
Tartans competed at the Mid-
east Regional tournament 
and placed third. This place-
ment won them the bid to the 
NCAA tournament, and ?ve of 
the seven Tartan runners that 
attended the meet earned all-
region status after placing in 
the top 35. The representa-
tives from Carnegie Mellon 
will be joining three other 
teams from the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
at the national tournament. 
Carnegie Mellon tied for the 
UAA title with rival Washing-
ton University in St. Louis in 
October. The NCAA champi-
onships will be held at the E.P 
“Tom” Sawyer Park in Louis-
ville, Kentucky on Saturday, 
Nov. 19. The race is set to start 
at noon, and even though the 
Tartans have to travel, they’ll 
be hungry for high place-
ments in the upcoming race 
so they can prove themselves 
to the nation. 
The regular season went 
quite well for the Tartan 
squad, but that’s not an un-
common occurence for the 
team from Carnegie Mellon. 
The cross country team has 
placed at least third in every 
single meet this season, and 
even placed ?rst at ?ve of 
those competitions. 
Regional competition was 
a breeze for the Tartans, as 
they placed ?rst in the Uni-
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) tournament, and third 
overall out of 52 total teams 
in the NCAA regional tourna-
ment at DeSales University. 
The Tartan men will look to 
replicate the success they saw 
in the regular season by bring-
ing their trademark vigor and 
aggression to the course.
The men of the Tartan 
cross country team weren’t 
the only people to make it 
to a national competition, 
though. Junior Aparn Alavilli 
of the Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s cross country team also 
earned herself a spot at the 
NCAA tournament. Alavilli 
is now the eighth Tartan in 
history to earn an individual 
nomination to competition at 
the national level. She earned 
the bid after she competed at 
the Mideast Regional compe-
tition at DeSales University in 
Center Valley, Penn. on Sat-
urday. Alavilli placed 13th in 
that race with a time of 22:01 
which greatly helped her bid 
to the NCAA championship. 
Alavilli also has a leg up 
on the competition in that she 
has already ran the course 
that the NCAA champion-
ships will take place on. Her 
team competed at the Greater 
Louisville Classic in Kentucky 
earlier this season, where 
she ?nished with a time of 
22:31.62. Now she’ll have to 
push herself to the limit if she 
wants to take a top spot at the 
national competition. 
That race is set to begin 
an hour before the men at 11 
a.m., at the same location. 
The Tartan athletes will sure-
ly head to Kentucky ready to 
make the Tartan name proud 
and bring home a trophy.

Sarah Gutekunst | Publisheradvice for awkward people
on coping with disaster
Dear Sarah,
I’m dead, and the election killed me. 
I guess I was too stuck in my so-called liberal elite 
bubble (where I’m perfectly happy, thank you very 
much) to realize that it was going to happen. I was 
nervous back in the summer when I was living with my 
parents in central Pennsylvania, but once I got back 
to Pittsburgh, the debates happened, and Trump’s 
“locker room talk” scandal hit, I thought there was 
NO POSSIBLE WAY IN HELL anyone on the fence 
could swing to the right.
So Tuesday, as I sat in McConomy watching the live 
coverage, I kept telling myself I would leave to start 
my homework as soon as Clinton secured her com-
fortable lead. I kept saying, just another half hour, just 
another half hour. And as the half hours passed, it 
was Trump who secured his comfortable lead, not my 
girl Hill-Dawg. So I left, but I couldn’t do homework. I 
numbed myself up and went to sleep, hoping some-
thing crazy would happen overnight that would make 
things right.
But Wednesday when I woke up, nothing was right. 
I’m not ashamed to say I cried. Since Wednesday 
morning I haven’t been able to escape it. On 
Facebook and Twitter, in conversations with friends, 
in the hallways on campus, and in emails from school 
officials, President Trump is everywhere. He’s also in 
my hometown, at York County School of Technology, 
where racial tensions escalated into a video circulated 
on Facebook showing students carrying Trump signs 
through the hall and shouting white power. This isn’t 
an isolated incident. Our nation is erupting with vitriol 
on both sides. How can I be happy again?
Dead Inside Since Trump Remains An Ugly Goddamn 
Half-wit Troll
Dear DISTRAUGHT,
This has been a very challenging week for many 
people on campus, in Pittsburgh, in America, and in 
the world. The fact that Trump will be president has 
shaken us. The reality that so many Americans voted 
for him is shocking.
Thinking on this large scale about the election and 
its potential consequences is really scary. There are 
so many massive problems that we’re left to tackle 
without the government’s help — climate change, 
student debt, racism, sexism, LGBTQ rights, immigra-
tion reform, etc. Now, there are countless organiza-
tions in America working for these things that need 
our help. When the Trump administration tries to 
halt progress, join the corps to keep pushing back. 
This is the best thing you can do, but it’s unlikely to 
make you happy again.
What might be more helpful is thinking small. The 
big issues are like scary monsters out to eat us all. 
But when we think small, we can remember the 
good. Sit in your room and look around. You have 
a home and that is good. What’s in that room? 
Good things, like a comfy bed, a laptop that plays 
good shows and movies with the click of a but-
ton! In my case, two small hamsters that embody 
all the innocence and goodness that make Trump 
less significant. Do you also have a phone in your 
hand? Call your mom, brother, grandma, aunt, or 
whoever. Remind them you love them, and they’ll 
remind you that they love you, too. Reminisce on 
that Christmas when you were 11 and got your first 
PlayStation. Remember how happy you were.
Remember the good to feel better. Remember that 
you have good in your life, but don’t forget that 
there is still evil. Go forth with the joy and power 
that comes from the good and happy, and use it to 
make the evil insignificant.
You are loved. You are important. You are wanted. 
You are more than your president.
Love, Sarah.

the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens are the ultimate near-campus de-stresser
Phipps Conservatory is a public conservatory and 
botanical garden right next to our campus that 
is free to all Carnegie Mellon students. It’s the 
perfect place to go to when you’re tired of the 
midterms and gloomy days, and just want a ray of 
happiness in your life.
Unlike most botanical gardens, Phipps has a 
constantly changing main exhibition. In November, 
the new winter flower show will open, featuring all 
of the holiday season’s events and fun educational 
programs. 
Also, Phipps is one of the most green and 
environmentally friendly conservatory and 
garden sets. Most of the gardens in Phipps are 
designed to be environmentally sustainable, and 
Phipps’ greenhouse production facility is the first 
greenhouse anywhere to receive a platinum LEED 
certification.
Besides all the flowers and plants, Phipps has some 
of the cutest decorations ever. Each small garden 
has a theme of its own. You can walk into a romantic 
french-styled garden with the moon and stars 
decorated above, or a fall-season themed garden 
with scarecrows and pumpkins.
As it gets closer to the holiday season, plenty of 
Christmas trees are placed and decorated with 
sparkling lights, and various gardens are winter-
themed with cute snowmen, and snowflakes 
hanging on the ceiling.
One of the most mesmerizing exhibits is the 
“Garden Railroad: 200 Years of Pittsburgh.” 
The garden features miniature models of all the 
important sites in Pittsburgh, capturing its history 
over the past 200 years. Here, you can see the 
H.J. Heinz Factory back in 1869, the Cathedral of 
Learning, the Duquesne Incline, the renovated 
2013 Point Park fountain and even a small model of 
Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood that takes us back to 
childhood.
Maybe it’s because I’m in college, or because I just 
suffered through a midterm and have two more 
on the way, but I was really inspired by my visit 
to Phipps. It was colorful. It was vivid. Everything 
seemed so full of life.
Do you want a nice break, and a quick and easy way 
to stay happy? Go to Phipps! Pretty colors, warm 
temperatures, and fantastic smells. Why not?

Ukraine is one of the weirder places to tell people 
you are going. This is especially true when you tell 
your professors and friends, “Sorry, I won’t be able 
to be there next week. I’m going to be in Ukraine. 
For music.” That will get you a reaction that is a 
blend of surprised and confused. When I first found 
out, I pretty much had the same reaction. I have 
probably submitted pieces to at least 50 calls for 
scores. I have received a few yesses and a plethora 
of nos. This was my first big orchestral gig. I did 
not expect to be told that they wanted to play my 
piece. After that initial shock, I realized I had no 
idea what to expect from Ukraine.
“Okay so what did you know about Ukraine, before 
coming to Lviv?”
“Ummm, well I know what I read on Wikipedia. 
I know what I learned in European History in 
high school. Oh, everything that we read about 
Crimea—”
“Of course. The world now knows Ukraine exists 
because we’re being taken over. And it’s even 
worse because it’s Russia.”
I was chatting with these two Ukrainian college stu-
dents that I had met at a bar in the city center called 
Pravda. “Pravda” means “truth” and was also the 
name of the Soviet propaganda magazine. There are 
a number of these restaurants and bars that are So-
viet- or Ukrainian Revolution-themed. The city has a lot 
of tourists, but not from the West. Lviv, the city I was 
based in, is one of the cultural capitals of Eastern Eu-
rope. On the weekends, families, university students, 
school groups, lood into the city to see the big city 
and old buildings.
When I irst arrived at the airport, I wandered over 
to the small bus stop next to the arrivals port through 
the swarm of taxi drivers offering me “a great price.” 
There were three other people waiting for the bus: this 
other American and a Ukrainian woman and her child. 
The Ukrainian woman turned out to be a Jehovah’s 
witness and promptly began working at convincing 
the other American and me that we should join her 
that coming Sunday. She also gave us directions to our 
hostels and excellent recommendations about the best 
bakery in town. The other American turned out to be a 
retired fashion executive who had quit his job to travel 
the world and write novels; he was currently en route 
to a pilgrimage to follow the steps of Buddha in India 
and working on a novel exploring his family’s immigra-
tion to the U.S. from Japan.
After waiting 40 minutes, the bus pulled up. Well, a 
“bus” that was the size of a large van with wooden 
seats, packed wall-to-wall with standing room only. It 
was bright yellow and swayed around every corner.
I always love being on public transit in the cities I visit. 
I like getting to see the people go about their days on 
their commute. See the streets. Feel the energy of the 
city.
Despite the feeling that at any moment, this large yel-
low box on wheels could lip and kill us all, this was 
deinitely one of my favorite moments. The vibrancy 
and soul of the city lickered by through the smudgy 
windows: brightly colored orthodox churches, ciga-
rette kiosks, decadent 18th century apartments (with 
plaster chipping), a sprinkling of grey Soviet block 
apartments, and people luttering about the streets. 
From this start and through my time there, Lviv struck 
me with a particular kind of dichotomy that makes it so 
exciting and interesting.

---------------------------------------------------

Lviv is now in the northeastern part of Ukraine. For 
reference, Crimea is in the southeast. Lviv used to be 
part of the Soviet Union, and before that, Poland, 
and before that Austria, and before that Ukraine 
again. It also goes by different names: Lviv, Lwow, 
Lvov, Lemberg; each a relection of the people that 
used to govern this place and their language (Ukrai-
nian, Polish, Russian, German). 
The Ukrainians are very proud of their language. 
Most of them also speak Russian, but are deinitely 
quite offended if you ask them “Aren’t Ukrainian and 
Russian the same thing?” (luckily, I didn’t ask this).
“The Russians stole our language, just like they stole 
our history for themselves and their mythology. We 
[the Ukrainians] founded Russia thousands of years 
ago, and then they spent the time since trying to take 
us over and steal our culture.”
The sentiment here is deinitely very anti-Russian. 
And there is also a surge in pro-Ukrainian national-
ism: a strain of nationalism that is constructive … for 
now.
The Ukrainians have been oppressed for a very long 
time. When the Soviet Union irst dissolved in 1991, 
there was an initial urge to become “western.” A re-
lection of this is the sheer number of knock-off Apple 
Stores, and the bright and shiny new shopping cen-
ter near the city center that stocks all the standards: 
Levi’s, Zara, H&M, etc. Now there is a bit of a push 
to move against this. The country of Ukraine is poor-
er than its neighbors to the west.
This push for imported western goods means that 
these items are extremely expensive for consumers 
and also leave the domestic economy rotting. There 
are new groups of clothing designers and product 
designers whose mission is to show the world that 
Ukraine can make its own products that match or 
beat the western equivalents in quality, while main-
taining their own sense of culture and supporting 
the domestic economy of design and production, 
all while making products at prices that are much 
more affordable for Ukrainian consumers. This is not 
a permeating trend among all groups for a variety 
of reasons.
The college students were deinitely on trend with 
American fashion. One of them went to high school 
in Los Angeles and ranted to me about how much she 
missed Whole Foods and Chipotle. The trends toward 
nationalism extend beyond the realm of clothing. 
I was there from Oct. 25th to Oct. 31st. As I met 
Ukrainians (patrons at bars and cafes, musicians 
in the orchestra, people at my hostel), they ex-
pressed as much anticipation and concern with 
the coming American election as with their own 
political landscape.
While I was there, there were a number of pro-
tests by the Ukrainian Liberation Army. They 
marched through the city and demonstrated 
outside the enormous statue of Ivan Franko, the 
father of modern Ukraine, and distributed pam-
phlets proclaiming themselves as “Terrorists for 
the Nation” and decrying the “Russian aggres-
sion in the east.”
This city and this country are definitely split 
and being pulled in many different directions. 
There are those that are progressive and for-
ward thinking and those that are conservative 
and traditional, those that want the nation to 
become more like the West, those that want it 
to be more like Russia (a scant minority in these 
parts), and those that proclaim their pride at be-
ing Ukrainian.

The a cappella dream show, right here at Carnegie MellonKaty Dyer
 Junior Staffwriter
Last Friday night, as I sat in the very front row of 
folding chairs in Rangos and stared at the impos-
ing “#VERTIGO” projected on the curtain, I quite 
frankly wasn’t sure what to expect. I’d never been 
to an a cappella performance in my entire life, and 
I’m a die-hard classic rock fan. Needless to say, 
I was a little apprehensive about my ability to sit 
through two hours of enthusiastic harmonizing.
Boy, oh boy, were those fears misplaced.
As soon as The Originals, Carnegie Mellon’s 
all-male a cappella powerhouse, burst onto the 
stage to cheers and screams from the audience, 
the energy in the room became palpable. As The 
Originals slid smoothly into a sugary, slick rendi-
tion of “Levels” by Nick Jonas, I suddenly under-
stood the electricity that had been steadily building 
since I’d taken my seat. The group’s voices cycli-
cally diverged and converged, swelling together at 
times to hit chill-inducing notes and fanning out at 
others to create funky twists on Jonas’ pop classic.
With my apprehensions swiftly obliterated by 
the first song, I spent the remainder of Vertigo 
rooted to my chair, unwilling to peel my eyes and 
ears away from the spectacle for even a second. 
The Originals transitioned into Beyoncé’s soulful 
power-ballad named, “I Care,” followed by a del-
icate and poignant performance of Bianca Ryan’s 
“Alice.” This song was sang with amazing clarity 
and vocal range by junior Drama major Kyle Pitts. 
Next, the group jumped with gusto into Justin 
Timberlake’s “Strawberry Bubblegum,” a sexy, 
jazzy number that the crowd went wild for. Finally, 
to cap off the night, The Originals gave us a final 
hit of what they do best with Demi Lovato’s “Stone 
Cold,” an intoxicating display of raw emotion. The 
group finished their set with a plug for their new 
EP, VOID, which dropped the same day as Vertigo.
Next, the stage was turned over to Voices in Your 
Head, a coed a cappella troupe from the University 
of Chicago. The members filed onstage wearing 
spiffy black suits and cocktail dresses, combined 
with a rainbow of colored leggings and ties for 
a business-formal-with-a-twist aesthetic. As they 
launched into their first song, I was struck by the 
incredible vocal range of the group. Their songs 
were often stripped-down and slower-paced, with 
interweaving harmonies and precise background

beats that elevated their performance. As they sang, I simply sat and let 
their smooth voices wash over me, awed by both their technical precision 
and their clear camaraderie as a team.
Voices in Your Head was followed by University of Maryland’s premier coed a 
cappella group, Faux Paz, who gave a wonderfully passionate and sleek per-
formance, comprised mostly of vamped-up pop hits. Members strutted across 
the stage in self-assured synchrony, and soloists poured their heart into each 
note. They had alluring confidence, hair-raisingly tight harmonies and beats, 
and a dedication to the drama of their performance that evoked a Broadway 
show. One of the best moments of the night came when one of Faux Paz’s 
soloists took on “Dog Days Are Over” by Florence + The Machine, bringing 
the house down with stunning vocal gymnastics and incredible finesse.
Faux Paz was succeeded by Lark, an all-female a cappella group from the 
University of Colorado. Having been introduced by The Originals as, “a 
group that redefined a cappella,” I immediately understood why as soon 
as the troupe walked out onstage. They were dressed in ‘50s-era vintage 
dresses and suits, but each member brought an edgy twist to the look that 
made it more badass than demure. A wide berth was given to bubblegum 
pop fare, with the group instead ranging from Sylvan Esso’s layered, kalei-
doscopic “Hey Mami” to “Mad Hatter” by Melanie Martinez. This last song 
was performed to perfection, with creepy, doll-like choreography, sick 
beatboxing, and theatrical, echoing vocals.
After Lark’s departure, we all enthusiastically clung to the appearance of 
the night’s final a cappella group, The Nor’easters, unwilling to acknowl-
edge that Vertigo would be ending soon. Traveling all the way from 
Northeastern University in Boston, The Nor’easters’ reputation had pre-
ceded them. However, they far exceeded the hype, effortlessly combining 
silky harmonies and swelling, passionate solos delivered with razor-sharp 
vocal precision. The large group, dressed in all black and cloaked in confi-
dence, moved as one through recent EDM-pop fusion hits such as Bieber’s 
“Sorry,” much to the delight of the audience. Ending the night with 
Sam Smith’s swelling, operatic Bond theme, “Writing’s on the Wall,” the 
Nor’easters gave the crowd more chills than the November weather ever 
could.
After attending a concert, I normally say I can feel the beat in my body – but 
after Vertigo, I felt the beat-boxing in my bones instead. Every member of 
the crowd came together in awe of the sheer vocal power displayed, and 
we were all emotionally moved by Vertigo to a degree we hadn’t anticipat-
ed. As one member of Faux Paz put it while reflecting on America’s divisive 
political climate, “Music is a way that all of us can connect and heal,” and 
Vertigo was a perfect example of just that.

iLOVEMAKONNEN
Ab Fall concert in Wiegand Gymnasium 
enthralls & entertains audiences
K.FLAY
&
It’s been ten years since I’ve last gone to a concert. I’d always wanted to go to one since then, but I never had the time 
in high school. So when I first stepped foot into an almost unrecognizable Wiegand Gymnasium, I had no idea what to 
expect. I got to the concert early, so there was a lot of space right in front of the stage. The fog machines and blinding 
strobe lights were already on, creating some cool effects as the stage crew continued to set up; at the same time, more 
and more people were arriving.
I came in not knowing too much about either of the performers: iLoveMakonnen and his opening act, K. Flay. To be 
honest I only knew of one song by iLoveMakonnen, which was “Tuesday” ft. Drake (although I probably wasn’t the only 
one), while I had never listened to K. Flay’s music before. Luckily for me, seeing them perform live would help me learn 
a lot more about them as artists.
Starting off the entire concert, K. Flay came out on stage wearing a rocker outfit with ripped jeans, Doc Martens, and 
a black t-shirt. With her bassist, guitarist, and drummer starting off the song, I first expected to hear rock or alternative 
music. But once the Chicago-based artist started rapping the first verses of her single “Can’t Sleep,” I found that the 
music was like nothing I’ve ever heard before. It was so unique, combining alternative and rap. K. Flay’s indie-sounding 
voice transformed the rap into something totally different from the music heard on the radio, and the instrumentals 
complemented everything so well. All the while, the passion she had for her music was clearly shown on stage as she 
danced around all the flashing lights; because she was having a good time during her performances, the audience had 
a good time, too, with people swaying and bobbing their heads. Everyone, including myself, had a chill time listening to 
her music. Some of the other songs in her set included “It’s Strange,” a song by Louis The Child, which she is featured in, 
“Dreamers,” “You Felt Right,” and “FML.” Her performance overall was worth watching, and it definitely put the crowd 
in a lively mood for iLoveMakonnen.
We had to wait about 30 minutes after K. Flay’s performance to see iLoveMakonnen. During that time, the stage crew 
cleared the entire band’s set and left a turntable on stage for one of iLoveMakonnen’s DJs. Just from the stage setup you 
could tell just how different both artists’ music styles were, even though they both rapped. Once the DJs came on stage, 
they started remixing popular rap and R&B singles to pump up the crowd. With all our hands in the air and everyone 
moving to the rhythm, the concert turned into a huge dance party. All of the lights were flashing right in our eyes, and fog 
from the fog machines covered almost the entire front of the stage.
The DJ finally had iLoveMakonnen come out on stage, and he started off his set with his song “Home (Hating On Me).” 
He came across as cool, and seemed like he wanted nothing but a fun time with the audience. Whether it was when he 
took a few minutes in between songs to talk to members of the audience, or when he’d wipe off his sweat on t-shirts and 
throw them into the crowd, he seemed to love interacting with all of us. The greatest thing was that the audience loved 
interacting with him and his music, too. His music gave off another feel-good vibe, but one different from that in K. Flay’s 
music; this was the R&B and rap music that we often hear nowadays. People right next to me were dancing the milly rock, a 
large crowd to my right was jumping and waving their hands in the air, and right behind me a number of people had made 
a dance circle. iLoveMakonnen got everyone in the gym to let loose and have a great time with him. Thirty minutes into 
the set he performed his hit, “Tuesday,” and had everyone singing along. Other songs he played throughout the night 
were “I like Tuh,” a song by Carnage which he’s featured in, “I Don’t Sell Molly No More,” “Flippin All Night,” and more.
Although I’m still recovering from all the music having been blasted in my ears (it was my fault, I stood right by the speak-
ers), I had really great time. Activities Board did an amazing job organizing the entire concert, and it was obvious that 
everyone in the gym, including the performers, enjoyed themselves. I’m definitely satisfied with my first concert experi-
ence in a long time, and I can’t wait for all the other upcoming concert events this year.

Sarah Gutekunst | PublisherOn Baking
Sugar, butter, and all things delightful
10
Design by Aisha Han | Assistant Visual Editor
When I tell people I like to bake cakes, it makes me laugh how often they 
assume that passion extends to cooking.
Cooking is actually among my worst nightmares. I don’t like to have any part in 
the creation of savory, mouth-watering delights — only the consumption. 
I’m far too impatient, too poor at multitasking, and even worse at 
time management. I’d rather lie in bed just up until dinner is ready, 
then sit down and massacre a plate full of hearty sustenance. All 
of the reasons I hate to cook make baking such a delight for 
me. Cooking is a scary forest where you have to machete your 
way to safety. Baking is a three-lane highway. Cooking requires 
multiple processes to co-occur. Baking only asks that you can 
follow the recipe a step at a time. Cooking produces food I des-
perately want to eat, making the waiting unbearable. But I’ve never 
had a sweet tooth, so I can revel in the process of baking without slob-
bering over the end result.
From butter and sugar to a polished, frosted, and occasionally even filled cake, each 
step is a delight. In fact, the butter and sugar step is the biggest delight of all. As much 
as those fun-sucking nutritionists try to vilify butter and sugar, they are the essence of 
flavor. No finished baked good will ever excite me as much as their union. And this is the 
basis for every cake (that isn’t an angel food or sponge cake). Not only is there comfort 
in the smell that fills the whole room while my mixer works to smash the butter and sugar 
into a light yellow cream from heaven, there is also much comfort in this consistency. No 
matter what, if I want to make a cake, I start in this place. This wonderful, intoxicating place.
And while the measurements and individual ingredients can change from cake to cake, I know 
that right after this I will add eggs and vanilla extract. And to bring it all together, the mix of dry 
ingredients, like flour and baking soda and salt, go in alternating thirds with halves of the liquid, 
like milk, buttermilk, water, or even sour cream. (It also makes me laugh when people realize there 
can be sour cream in cakes. Sometimes they’re surprised, like sour cream shouldn’t be there, but it 
does wonders for a rich, moist cake.) Then while the cake is in the oven, I have a perfectly carved out 
period of time to make the frosting. I’ve perfected a buttercream base that never fails. Cream the butter 
with the vanilla, add powdered sugar back and forth with milk until the frosting is shiny, but doesn’t run off 
a spatula held straight up and down. The road map is so easy, like a route I’ve driven a hundred times — 
except I sing even louder in the kitchen than I do in the car, with room to actually dance!
Because I’m so comfortable, even enthralled by the process, I can be more comfortable pushing the 
boundaries. A basic vanilla cake with vanilla frosting is too boring; the fun is in the flavor, and there are so 
many ways to create it. In my arsenal, I have fruit, zest, juice, jam, powders, extracts, creams, liqueurs, and 
more. Then I get to find combinations of all of those flavors that taste delicious, but also don’t screw up 
the texture. It’s a balancing act, and I’m pulling the strings. And in the end, I get to decorate it. It doesn’t 
have to be perfect, but the time I spend with a piping bag, deciding on a round versus star tip, then 
getting the swirl just right, is so satisfying. Little tricks I’ve picked up over the years that look so fancy 
but aren’t that hard. All of this leads up to the most exciting part of all — feeding people I care about. 
Getting to see my cake bring joy to others brings me more joy than any cake ever could.
