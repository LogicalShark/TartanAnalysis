Morewood Undergoes 
Population Explosion
by Sue Attinson
Morewood Gardens has been filled beyond capacity this semester. The 
women’s residence hall which normally houses no more than 657 is pre­
sently filled with some 750 students: approximately 280 freshmen, 440 
returnees, and 25 transfers.
Because of the overflow of stu­
dents, residence applicants living 
within commuting distance have 
been asked to live at home.
Rooms on each floor which are 
ordinarily used as doubles (B2, B5,
Cl, C9, D5, DIO, C5, and 6A5)have 
been converted into triples making 
39 additional spaces. Also, six stu­
dents have been housed tempor­
arily in 1A1 (previously the guest 
apartment) which has no telephone 
hook-up, and 29 others have been 
placed in A, D and E Tower loun­
ges. These students were placed 
on the basis of their date of appli­
cation. Students who applied early 
received permanent quarters.
The old tower lounges, each of 
which is located at the end of a 
hall, have no closets but have been 
furnished with beds, dressers and 
desks. The new tower lounges, each 
of which does have a large walk-in 
closet (originally designated as the 
luggage room), have been furnished 
in a likewise manner. None of the 
lounges has a door but each has 
been partitioned off with a folding 
screen.
According to Virginia B. Milli­
gan, dean of women, the lounges— 
particularly those in A (the iionors’ 
tower)—will be emptied out as soon 
as possible. The A Tower rooms 
will also be cleared of freshmen.
After sorority pledging, qualifying 
women will be moved into available 
rooms in A,
At the end of this semester, fin­
ancial consideration will be given 
to those students who were forced 
to triple up for any extended period 
of time.
Said Dean Milligan with regard 
to the housing problem’s temporary 
solution, "We felt that if we had sat 
down and talked to the girls, they 
would have made the same de­
cision.*
She credited the problem itself 
to both increased enrollment and 
the changes in women’s housing 
regulations. «The creation of an 
‘honors’ dormitory took some of 
the steam off girls who had wished 
originally to move off campus.”
Thus, she feels, there were less 
openings than expected throughout 
the dorm.
She went on to say, however, 
that Morewood Gardens had been 
over-crowded in previous years;
"This is the way we grow. When 
we did this before, it was obvious 
that we were going to need more 
ddrm space and E tower was 
built...now I imagine that the ad­
ministration will think right away 
of expansion.*
Tech Orients New Frosh;
Class Size Sets Record
The largest class in the history of Carnegie Tech is taking part in 
this year’s orientation program. It contains 890students(480 Engineer­
ing and Science, 238 Fine Arts, 180 Margaret Morrison) a majority of 
whom are from Pennsylvania (47%), New York (11%), and Ohio (8%) 
although 38 states and four foreign countries are represented.

Dr. H. Guyford Stever and his 
family recently moved into a 15- 
room residence at 1045 Devon Rd., 
opposite the Carnegie Tech cam­
pus.
His new home was purchased 
last February by the school for 
$100,000. It has a living room, 
dining room, music room, family 
room, kitchen, a master bedroom, 
three other bedrooms, a library- 
study, spore room, three guest 
rooms and a maid’s room.

AH Designed 
ToConsolidate 
Office Space
The six-story administration 
building which is being constructed 
at the corner of Forbes and More­
wood Avenues is slated for com­
pletion by August 1966.
The structure and its parking 
garage will occupy what was for­
merly the site of Forbes Hall and 
parking lot. Upon completion of 
the building, the presently dis­
mantled front gate and concrete 
walk will be restored.
A $1.7 million gift from the 
Scaifes, the glass-enclosed rec­
tangular structure has been de­
signed to consolidate—so far as 
possible — all administrative 
offices. Its first floor will be de­
voted almost entirely to admissions 
and a centralized campus recep­
tion area. The deans of men and 
women, financial aid and housing 
offices, and graduate and under­
graduate day and night school re­
gistrars will operate from the 
second floor.
The entire west side of the third 
floor will be designated for per­
sonnel use and other parts of the 
floor will be used by the pur­
chasing office. The accounting and 
payroll staff will occupy the fourth 
floor and fund-raising functions 
will be handled on the fifth. The 
president, his administrative offi­
cers, and the Board of Trustees 
will have sixth floor offices.
A Concourse Level with its own 
entrance, will contain the Cash­
ier’s Office and a Management In­
formation Center. Computers will 
eventually be installed in the Cen­
ter to handle all administrative 
data processing.
To the Students of Carnegie Tech
A Letter Of Welcome 
From CIT’s President
Greetings and welcome to all Carnegie Tech students, especially to 
the freshmen and others who are new on our campus. As an experienced 
veteran of one semester at Tech, I can tell you newcomers that it is a 
dynamic place to be. ________________________________
Your college life here at Car­
negie Tech will provide rich op­
portunities to establish personal 
standards and values at the same 
time that you are developing pro­
fessional ones. And seldom has 
the need for individual values of 
the highest order been needed
more. The serious international 
troubles, the domestic and foreign 
civil rights activities, the inten­
sity of our economic growth, the 
increasing demand for the highly 
educated professional, the greater 
interest by all leaders of our 
country in higher education, the 
greater demand for beauty and 
culture in our civilization, all add 
a new dimension, a new strength 
of purpose to our educational 
scene.
I hope you will participate in and 
benefit from all aspects of your 
college experience and that you 
will continue to make this a goal 
for yourself throughout your Car­
negie career.
I am looking forward to my first 
complete year with you. All my 
best wishes go to you for a success­
ful and enjoyable time.
Cordially Yours,
Grants Awarded 
For Grad Studies
Various scholarships are now 
available for graduate studies.
The Danforth Graduate Fellow­
ships provide students preparing 
for college teaching with funds for 
their Ph.D graduate study. Appli­
cants must be nominated by Car­
negie Tech not later than Novem­
ber 1.

The class’s enlarged size, 80 
more students than last year, is 
due mainly to an increased E&S 
enrollment.
The orientation program itself 
began on Friday with an afternoon
of receptions. The deans of each 
college and President H. Guyford 
Stever and his wife greeted the 
frosh and their parents.
In the evening, Dr. Stever gave 
his welcome address and a dance 
was held.
Summer Reading 
On Saturday, in addition to the 
usual testing and Sports Day, stu­
dents participated in a revised 
summer reading discussion pro­
gram. A faculty panel consisting 
of James P. Romauldi (Civil En­
gineering), James L. Rosenberg 
(Drama), KentC. Bloomer (Archi­
tecture), and Richard R. O’Keefe 
(English), and moderated by ¦m 
Fred Sochatoff (English) present­
ed and discussed diverse views 
on the nature of the creative proc­
ess. (Ghiselin’s "The Creative 
Process* was required reading.) 
Later, 40 upperclassmen led the 
frosh in further discussions.
A movie, "The Maltese Falcon,* 
and folk singing with "We Three* 
were offered as evening entertain­
ment.
Activities Fair 
At Sunday’s Activities Fair more 
than 20 campus organizations pre­
sented information about them­
selves. (see "What’s Doing On 
Campus). In the evening, freshmen 
attended a concert of classical 
cello and jazz after which a spon­
taneous dance was held.
"Freedom and Decision in the 
Community of Learning* was the 
topic of a Monday night Y present­
ation dealing with the major de­
cisions frosh have to make during 
their first months of school.
On Tuesday evening, the Dorm­
itory Councils sponsored a dance 
and scotch’n’ Soda entertained.

Council Cities Changes
In Women’s Housing
Women’s Dormitory Council for 1965-66 has assumed the responsi­
bility for demonstrating to incoming students and for showing once more 
to upperclassmen that it can be — is — a vital and relevant organiza­
tion.
Major changes in the dormitory 
living situation and in the Council’s 
structure have been adopted by this 
past year’s Council. This year sees 
the inauguration of: sorority suites 
and other special floors, *A* 
Tower as an honors tower, off- 
campus living for seniors and wo­
men over 21 years of age, and a 
separate Judiciary.
Will the benefits gained by those 
residing in these new living ar­
rangements more than off-set the 
voiced disadvantages of class and 
group segregation? What effects 
will group living units have on 
Council? Will the interests of the 
majority become secondary to 
those of the minorities? This year 
Council must observe, evaluate, 
and act on matters related to 
these and other questions.
Functioning primarily as a legis­
lative and executive body with the 
introduction of the separate Judi­
ciary, Council will be in a better 
position to consider ways of making 
dormitory living more pleasant for 
all residents. More mixers, art 
displays, open houses, additions to 
the record library, further meal 
exchanges, and the purchase of de­
sired major appliances head the 
list.
The means? At present, the 
limited commissions received

from food and washing machines. 
This year we hope the need for 
additional funds to expand in these 
areas will be recognized and will 
lead to the institution of an activi­
ties fee for all women students— 
all women because Council should 
no longer consider solely the wel­
fare of dormitory residents, but 
should begin thinking in terms of 
an association of women students.
To carry on its work, Council 
needs your support, comment, and 
criticism. In turn, we must pro­
vide channels for your communi­
cations and then must be respon­
sive to these communications.

As president of Panhellenic Council, an organization representing 
the seven national sororities on campus, I extend a warm welcome to
all incoming freshmen.
Each of the seven Greek sor­
orities; AEP, CO, DDD, DG, KAT, 
KKG, and SK, has its own charac­
teristics, standards, and teach­
ings. Yet, one can see these seven 
distinct groups work together in a 
successful Panhellenic Council.
Outwardly it would appear that 
the function of sororities is to 
serve as social organizations. It 
appears this way because you see 
the results of our activities. But 
we are members of Greek groups 
for more than social reasons. We 
are united by similar ideals and 
purposes. Our Panhellenic Creed 
emphasizes the need for good 
scholarship, cooperation with col­
lege policies, high standards, good 
citizenship, and service to the col­
lege community.
The Panhellenic Council, com­
posed of officers and two dele­
gates from each group, works un­
der the guidance of the adminis­
tration and advisors. We solve 
problems common to all seven 
groups, help to organize mass acti­
vities and friendly competition, and 
decide upon the sorority rushing 
rules and schedule for the Carnegie 
Tech campus.
This coming academic year pro­
mises to be an active one. As usual, 
Panhel will be involved in the tradi- 
^ tional big campus weekends Home­
coming, Greek Swing, and Spring 
Carnival. In addition, plans are 
underway for another Best Dressed 
Girl contest sponsored by Glamour 
Magazine, an extended cultural 
program of guest speakers, a fash­
ion show for freshman women, and 
Greek Week.
Initial introductions to sorority 
women will be held at the Round 
^Robins on October 3 and 24. Offi­
cial Rush will start with Open 
House, November 7, and Rush 
Week, itself, will take place Nov­
ember 14 through 20.
I would like to encourage the 
freshmen and hope that all other 
Carnegie Tech women will come 
out to *meet the Greeks.”
> ROTC Starts 
47th Year 
At Carnegie
This fall, the Carnegie Tech 
ROTC detachment begins its 47th 
year of preparing students for 
commissions in the U.S. ArmyRe- 
\ serve.
The program is voluntary: 
freshmen must take gym or ROTC 
and must complete a full year to 
qualify for graduation. The cadets 
earn five units per semester for 
two class periods and one drill 
period each week. The first two 
years of courses are spent in 
learning basic subjects required of 
all Army officers. All books, uni­
forms, and other equipment are 
supplied.
At the end of their sophomore 
year, students who elect not to 
continue are given course comple­
tion certificates, which permit 
them to enlist in the U.S. Army 
Reserve in the third level pay 
grade. Those who elect to continue 
become members of the reserve, 
and receive a $40 monthly subsis- 
1tence pay.
1 Although the normal course for 
advanced corps ROTC calls for 
five hours of class weekly, Car­
negie Tech advanced corps cadets 
may make an academic substitu­
tion, cutting the requirement to 
three hours weekly.
During the junior year, empha­
sis is on signal or engineer sub­
jects. The summer of that year 
cadets attend a six week summer 
camp. on graduation from Car­
negie Tech, they are commiss­
ioned in the Army Reserve of Re­
gular Army.
Competition

basis of academic and/or profess­
ional record, the feasibility of the 
applicant’s proposed study plan, 
and personal qualifications. Pre­
ference will be given to candidates 
who have not had prior opportunity 
for extended study or residence 
abroad and who are under the age 
of 35.

Reviews Tech Publications
Quiet in the station! - Mike #3 on the air. Scrap the lead news, Ev, 
Woodlawn just burned up. Get a photographer down there fast.
Writing a poem, balancing budgets, experimenting in offset graphics, 
practicing management skills, communicating a unique design problem, 
illustrating, editing, script writing, copy reading and color photography.
All these are part of Carnegie 
Tech’s five publications; WRCT, 
24 hour day radio station; the Tar­
tan, weekly newspaper; the Car­
negie Technical, campus profess­
ional magazine; the Thistle, award 
winning yearbook; and Patterns, 
annual literary magazine.
On a diverse campus such as 
Carnegie Tech’s these publications 
serve the major lines of communi­
cation between undergraduates. 
Gone is the high school public 
address system. In its place are 
WRCT and the Tartan.
But perhaps more important are 
the services that the publications 
do for their members. Over 150 
students are active, making them 
Tech’s biggest group of extra cur - 
riculars other than athletes. Each 
publication provides students with 
the opportunity to practice real 
life skills in an atmosphere free 
of faculty control.
The electrical engineer, graphic 
artist, painter, English major, or 
industrial manager readily finds 
artist, painter, English major, 
drama student or industrial man­
ager readily finds in the publica­
tions a chance to do what he is 
learning about. And he can im­
prove his communication and or­
ganization skills as well.
Each publication is like a min­
iature firm. Each has a product, 
either on paper or over the air. 
Each has expenses and each has 
income in advertising, subscrip­
tions and grants from the school. 
Each must balance its books and 
prepare budgets. And each must 
combine the efforts of people from 
all sides of the campus to achieve 
its goals.
Coordinating the five publica­
tions is the Carnegie Tech chapter
of Pi Delta Epsilon, the national 
journalism honorary. The group 
serves to honor outstanding mem­
bers of each publication and deal 
with problems of mutual concern. 
The PiDE executive committee, 
consisting of all editors and the 
officers of the honorary, evaluates 
the standards and quality of each 
member publication. It also ap­
proves the appointment of major 
personnel. The PiDE treasurer has 
the job of keeping and evaluating 
financial reports and budget re­
quests.
PiDE is sponsoring an open 
house for all the publications this 
Sunday, September 19, at 2 p.m. 
Each publication will open its offi­
ce to interested underclassmen. 
By stopping into these Skibo head­
quarters, freshmen will be able 
to get a clear idea of the oppor­
tunities in each publication.

Editorial
Challenge Remains
During the last academic year, 
a number of significant steps were 
taken, aimed at achieving solutions 
to problems existing on the Car­
negie Tech campus. The admin­
istration, acting with a more stu- 
dent-oriented viewpoint, now de­
veloping under the leadership of 
Carnegie Tech's new president, 
Dr. H. Guyford Stever, responded 
to student petitions with surpris­
ing readiness.
Several of the new programs 
which were instituted, and some of 
revisions applied to existing pol­
icies are particularly noteworthy 
and are, most certainly deserving 
of comment.
The hours of operation for The 
Hunt Library were extended, pro­
viding students with far greater 
opportunity to profitably employ 
its facilities. Also, the student 
government and the administration 
undertook to investigate the nature 
and desirability of Carnegie Tech's 
present academic calendar. Com­
parisons between Carnegie Tech's 
calendar and those of other in­
stitutions of higher learning, not­
ably the University of Pennsylvania 
«B* calendar, were published. Fol­
lowing these comparisons, polls 
were conducted to determine stu­
dent and faculty opinions concern­
ing the most advantageous form 
which such a calendar should take. 
Work on this matter is still in 
progress.
Dr. Stever recently approved 
the establishment of an experi­
mental honors tower in More- 
wood Gardens. The women who 
have been chosen to reside there 
will be granted unprecedented 
freedom, and will not be subject to 
the imposition of curfews. Finally, 
concomitant with the honors tower 
program, sorority floors were es­
tablished in Morewood, a step de­
signed to aid these organizations in 
achieving the unity and cohesive­
ness which they have previously 
not experienced.
Significant as these achieve­
ments are, there still remain, how­
ever, many pressing problems to­
ward the solution of which the stu­
dents, faculty, and administratif 
must direct their energies. The 
challenge which the Carnegie Tech 
academic community must face is 
still very real.
The Tartan, in light of this, does 
not offer, in perfunctory fashion, 
any superficially optimistic view­
point concerning the degree of 
success which students, faculty, 
and administration might achieve 
during this academic year. The 
Tartan, rather, chooses to pre­
sent this challenge by outlining 
the major goals to be pursued, 
and to urge the Carnegie com­
munity to face that challenge with 
enthusiasm and vigor.
One major difficulty which has 
manifested itself quite clearly dur­
ing the past two weeks is that 
oversubscription of dormitory 
space has resulted in severely 
crowded conditions — both in the 
men's dormitory complex, and
Morewood Gardens. Expansion of 
the dormitory facilities is urgent­
ly needed. It is imperative, how­
ever, that prior to the adoption 
of any prospective housing plans, 
comprehensive investigations in­
to the nature of the education-liv- 
ing process at Carnegie Tech be 
conducted to insure that new liv­
ing facilities will fulfill the needs 
of students in all the diverse aca­
demic programs offered at Car­
negie Tech.
A somewhat less pressing, but 
nonetheless equally important 
problem is the need for a student 
union. Skibo serves only as an 
activities center; it does not pro­
vide satisfactory recreation and 
dining facilities, nor does it pro­
vide suitable student gathering 
places. It is basically a collection 
of meeting rooms, which has failed 
to substitute for a student union.
Furthermore, a mutual misun­
derstanding exists between the in­
dependent men on the one hand, 
and the fraternity men on the 
other. These two groups, rather 
than striving to maintain a har­
monious relationship with one an­
other, have established rivalries, 
have remained in ignorance of one 
another's attitudes, values, and 
goals, and have made virtually 
no attempt to establish a spirit of cooperation. This intolerable sit­
uation has served only to the 
detriment of the student govern­
ment, impairing its efficiency, and 
has seriously undermined enthu­
siasm and school spirit, especially 
among the independents.
Finally, the present constitution 
of the student government has 
proved, in many respects, very un­
satisfactory. The primary difficul­
ty is that the delineation of the 
responsibilities, privileges, and 
jurisdiction of the various 
branches of government is vague, 
resulting in infringements by some 
branches on what should be the 
responsibilities of others, and nul­
lifying the effects of check-and- 
balance systems which are incor­
porated within the frame of gov­
ernment. The conflicts which have 
arisen out of these deficiencies in 
the constitution have impaired the 
I j l^’tv of the student government to 
achieve its full potential as a dy­
namic force on campus.
To solve these problems, how­
ever, it is necessary to raise the 
level and increase the scope of 
communications on campus. To 
achieve the goals outlined above, 
there must be greater reciprocity 
and more comprehensive pro­
grams allowing for the exchange 
of ideas between faculty members 
of diverse professional fields, be­
tween students with divergent aca­
demic interests, and between the 
student body as a whole and the 
administration.
The solution to these problems 
presents a serious challenge. The 
Tartan forsees a fruitful year for 
Carnegie Tech only if the academic 
community strives to face that 
challenge with resolute deter­
mination.

The Search 
For Understanding
By James Panepinto
University’s Purpose
After enjoying the informalities 
of Freshman Camp and enduring 
the formalities of Orientation 
Week, most Carnegie Tech fresh­
men are now probably ready to 
join the Carnegie Tech Community 
and begin their undergraduate edu­
cation in earnest. Some may real­
ize that they are faced with a gen­
uine search for understanding, 
while others may presently view 
their stay at college as only a 
continuation of their high school 
education. A university such as 
Carnegie Tech, however, serves 
a much greater purpose.
A university's function as both 
Dr. Robert Morgan, Head of the 
Bureau of Measurement and Guid­
ance, and Dr. Hugh Young, Head of 
the Department of Natural Sci­
ences, Margaret Morrison Car­
negie College, pointed out at 
Freshman Camp, is *to discover 
and transmit the truth.* For ex­
ample, a physicist may be con­
cerned primarily with discovering 
the truth which is concealed in the
physical world and formulating it 
into useful principles. A psycholo­
gist, on the other hand, may be 
interested in helping an individual 
stabilize his own identity, and by 
so doing, become a more produc­
tive member of society. Both the 
physicist and the psychologist are 
helping to discover truth, as are 
other professional persons on the 
faculty of a university.
The value that a student de­
rives from his education is pri­
marily dependent upon himself. 
As obvious as this statement is, 
it is often overlooked by the stu­
dents themselves in their ration­
alizations of fruitless educations. 
A student may be able to graduate 
from a university without ever 
having to search for understanding. 
It is easier not to understand one's 
field and one's personal self than 
it is to understand these factors. 
Many will choose the easy way; 
hopefully many more will not.

a great opportunity to search for

The Trip to Jackson
Michael Malakoff, junior, IM, devoted his summer to engage in the 
Civil rights movement in Mississippi, as a member of the Mississippi 
Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). His work there was preceeded by 
ten days of lobbying in Washington, D.C. What will follow in this column, 
today, and in the weeks to come, is his personal account, presented in 
chronological order, of his experiences in and feelings about the civil 
rights movement. — ED.
The lobby has ended for us. It is the beginning for others. * Equality 
for all, let us be brothers, Wallace segregation is bound to fall.* The 
people outside the bus are singing, we on the bus are solemn as the staff 
workers, our friends, who wish us goodby, good luck, and *God be with 
you.* We wonder whether He will be. The justice of the south or rather 
the injustice that will soon surround us, seems to have already engulfed 
us. Life has become a very, very serious affair, the impact of which, for 
some of us, me included, has never hit us before.
The bus has now started moving. The words «Peace, Amen* drift 
through the window. The word Shalom comes into my mind. The bus 
slowly leaves the city that has been characterized as a roulette wheel, 
with the people the chips: Washington, D.C. The odds in Washington, in 
comparison with Mississippi, our destination, were in our favor, which 
we were to learn very shortly.
The fear builds up in me as the night goes on. Reading the paper, beat­
ings, arson, intimidation and harassment were something that didn't 
happen in my world of pushing a pencil for the last fourteen years. Re­
calling people standing up in session after session after session, con­
versing on cattle prods, billy clubs, and cells in a tone which reflected 
the common occurrence of them, left me with another impression. Their 
faces depicted the story of the south and its validity which none could 
now doubt...who listened. The fear increases.
Now I understand even better my own inadequacy as I realize I have 
been trained to work with tangible problems in which one can use logic 
and reason. Now, however, I must learn to cope with the abstract, 
people's ideas and thoughts, which differ quite a bit from my own due to 
trheir environment; one in which sixteen hour workdays are not un­
common, where twenty dollars a week is not uncommon, and where a 
fifth grade education is also not uncommon.
The bus goes on into the night. It stops, we have food, and the bus 
moves on into the darkness. Lakes, forests, moving streams, four- 
dollar-a-night hotels, ten cent hamburgers, world-famous-beyond-belief 
caverns, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, and, twenty hours later, Miss­
issippi, our destination and home for the next two months or longer. The 
asphalt with the white lines runs on, but for you they might just as well 
have ended in Jackson, the state capital....

Dept Gives 
New Focus 
On Biology
A new biology program in which 
methods, concepts, and approaches 
of mathematics, physics, chem­
istry, and engineering are used, 
is available to both graduate and 
undergraduate students in the Col­
lege of Engineering and Science at 
Carnegie Tech.
In the Department of Biological 
Sciences, headed by Dr. Jerome J. 
Wolken, students will probe for 
an understanding of the nature of 
life. Research is being conducted 
on such problems as growth, photo­
synthesis, embryological develop­
ment, nervous activity, brain func­
tion and the special senses of man. ^
An integral part of the new de- 
partment is the Biophysical Re­
search Laboratory, founded by Dr. 
Wolken in 1953 at Eye and Ear 
Hospital, University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center. Last year the 
laboratory moved to the Carnegie 
Tech campus, but continues to 
collaborate with the hospital and 
the medical center.
In this laboratory a decade of 
research has been devoted to stud­
ies of how living systems react 
to light. Further research will 
continue to probe the secrets of 
how living cells receive, convert, 
and use energy for reproduction, 
growth and development.
This kind of research, accord­
ing to Dr. Wolken, can provide ans­
wers to the question of hdw to pro­
vide food for an expanding popula- 
tion. We may also learn to develop ' 
new instruments for navigational 
guidance systems even devices 
that will give, in a sense, eyes 
to the blind, he added.
This type of research is possible 
in the Biophysical Research Lab­
oratory because of the equipment 
housed in its 5,000 square feet of 
space. Research facilities are 
available for biophysics, biochem- <^r 
istry, physical chemistry, biology, 
electron optics, spectroscopy, and 
electrophysiology. There are also 
tissue culture rooms, chemical 
coldrooms, an experimental in­
strument shop, dark rooms, photo­
graphic facilities and offices.
Courses currently offered in 
biology in the undergraduate pro­
gram are; general biology, general 
microbiology, pathogenic micro- ^ 
biology, genetics, immunology and 
serology, microbial physiology, 
parasitology, comparative anat­
omy of vertebrates, embryology, 
radiation biology, undergraduate 
research and seminars in special 
topics.
Graduate teaching, training, and 
thesis research will be continued 
in an enlarged cooperative pro­
gram, because Dr. Wolken is also 
research professor of physiology 
in the University of Pittsburgh 
School of Medicine.
understanding; they should not neg­
lect any facet available to them. 
This column is a search for un­
derstanding — it is hoped that my 
articles will serve as a stimulant 
to understanding, or at least, a 
reminder of this important goal. f.
Understanding is important in 
the world of reality — the world 
we live in — not just the world of 
ideas which primarily flourish in 
the university. It is my belief that 
many large and small scale prob­
lems in this world are caused by a 
lack of understanding by the par­
ticipants involved. An essential 
step in eliminating these problems m 
is obviously understanding. The * 
not-so-obvious factor is how to 
obtain and implement understand­
ing — this is what my column will 
search for this year.

The Artist and His Studies
This is the first of a series of articles exploring the nature of 
our university: its philosophies of education, the sympathies of 
its students, and the relationship between its students and its 
faculty. Norman 0. Rice, author, is dean of the College of Fine 
Arts.
A ‘Fine Arts student' is scarcely a type that can be pinned down by generalities. The arts themselves 
differ from each other and attract different kinds of people. In the end we have in this College everything 
from pragmatists to poets, with a range of characteristics in between that would astonish most people.
Some of the arts require tre­
mendous physical control, others 
do not. Sometimes the control is 
one of narrow tolerances, as in 
the fingering of a violin or the de­
lineation of an exact shape; some­
times it is perhaps no less pre­
cise but involves the whole body, 
as in tumbling around the stage. 
The mental controls have to be 
there, too. These are built up 
very systematically in all of the 
arts, starting with quite simple 
ideas and developing elaboration 
to the point at which reaction be­
comes instinctive. If one has to 
think about the mechanics of draw­
ing he does not draw, if one is 
preoccupied with the techniques of 
acting he doesn’t act. students are 
bound to have deep concern for the 
craft they are learning, but in my 
judgement the craft is perhaps the 
least part of their problem. Craft
course an artist should know all 
of the best literature in his own 
field and the best that has been 
written and said in all related 
fields. The humanities are ex­
tremely important to us if they are 
humanely taught, just as the scien­
ces are impoftant to us if they are 
taught with some recognition of the 
artist’s particular kind of sensiti­
vity and response. The world has 
placed, in recent years, a high 
premium on the capacity to deal 
knowledgeably with verbal and ma­
thematical symbols and it has tend­
ed to ignore the fact that ideas 
can be communicated with great 
force and clarity through other 
kinds of symbols - through struc­
ture, through gesture, through the 
ordering of sights and sounds 
among which creative people of 
some varities feel most at home.
gested are purely arbitrary and 
which may not be at all realistic 
for their purpose) we have de­
veloped programs which vary from 
department to department and even 
between options in the same de­
partment. About 25% of the total 
credit required in the College is in 
the general area of the humanities.
Some years ago the faculties of 
this college, working with Humani­
ties and Social Sciences, developed 
two basic courses. The first year 
we provide a combination writing 
and reading course, which we call 
Thought and Expression; in the 
second year we require a survey 
of man’s cultural history (that is 
to say history with emphasis on 
man’s cultural achievement rather 
than on his military, political or 
economic mutations). This course 
is called History of Arts and Civil-
must be mastered and accessible, 
but the arts begin by assuming an 
adequate base in craftsmanship, 
adequate, that is, for whatever ex­
pression has to be made. If the 
expressive urge is there, the 
means for turning it into art will 
generally be found.
More Than Craft Learning 
The problem of the school then 
is not to bear down on craft train­
ing exclusively for four college 
years. The kind of digital dexter­
ity that musicians and draftsmen 
need goes on and on and must be 
encouraged and practiced and de­
veloped to whatever strength the 
artist needs. The same can be said 
of voice controls as they are prac­
ticed by singers and actors. The 
projection of a tone is important 
just as the projection of a word 
may be. If education in the arts 
ended at teaching these things, our 
task would be much less complex 
and much duller. As it is, we be­
gin in each of our programs with 
the business of mastering adequate 
techniques. The departments ap­
proach this problem differently — 
each in its own way. In general, 
then, all fine arts programs build 
on the assumption of adequate 
techniques with ultimate emphasis 
on the adequate expression of 
ideas, stress on expressive capa­
bility increasing as a student ma­
tures.
Education in the Sciences 
The educational process in the 
arts is one of indirection, suggest­
ion, intimation, stimulation, spec­
ulation, demonstration, critical e- 
valuation and then usually recapu- 
tulation and a new beginning. In my 
observation, everything that an 
artist knows he can eventually use. 
But learning in the arts is consi­
derably more than assembling 
facts. Of course artists need to 
know something about history and 
about the great ideas of mankind. 
Of course artists need to know 
something about history and about 
the great ideas of mankind, of 
course artists should under­
stand the sciences and the politi­
cal systems of the world, and of
Circumventing Obsolescence
There is nothing magical about 
four years as an educational term 
for anyone and I suppose four 
years is never enough time to give 
an artist to learn his trade. We 
talk a good deal on this campus 
about preparing students to cir­
cumvent the pull toward obsoles­
cence. We do not have, in Fine 
Arts, quite the same problems 
that are found elsewhere, but I 
think we can say that the College 
of Fine Arts tries to do precisely 
this for the people it touches. The 
obsolescence we face, as I have 
indicated, is of a different kind. 
A good new idea in architecture 
does not make obsolete a good old 
idea. It is pointless, however, to 
go on simply reproducing old ideas 
or forms or encouraging their re­
production in a school.
Artists, that is to say creative 
and imaginative people, must learn 
how to make out of all the im­
pingements in their lives a syn­
thesis resulting in an overt state­
ment, one of fresh interpretation 
or of new import. «Heard melo­
dies are sweet but those unheard 
are sweeter* is hardly the analy­
sis of a musician; it is a poetic 
verbal image based on still another 
visual image. A musician needs to 
hear the melody to judge its'sweet- 
ness’ and unless he can create it 
according to his standards he has 
no function. We can proceed 
through all the arts and find para­
llels. A design which is described 
in words does not exist for the ar­
chitect, the potter, the painter, the 
playwright, the printer — they can 
imagine all they choose but ulti­
mately they have to produce. It is 
only by making external whatever 
ideas have been generated that the 
artist’s ideas can be judged.
Fine Arts Curriculum
With all of the preamble, what 
can I say about the curriculum in 
the College? I can describe it in 
fairly succinct terms. Architecture 
has five years and the other depart­
ments have four years; into these 
time limits (which as I have sug­
ization. It is possible for scholars 
to be scornful of both of these 
courses because they attempt far 
too much in the time we give them. 
They are intensive, they require a 
great deal of reading and writing 
and they are taught with varying 
levels of success by various mem­
bers of the faculty who have at­
tempted them over the years. In 
spite of their limitations, they do 
stimulate a desire in many stu­
dents to read more widely and they 
provide a base for intelligent read­
ing. In the ten years I have been on 
the campus there have been many 
changes in both of these courses. 
The English and History depart­
ments have worked hard and help­
fully with our own faculties in the 
hope of maximizing their interest 
and effectiveness. Although these 
courses are taken by all Fine Arts 
students, I am not sure that they 
are necessarily ideal for all stu­
dents in the College. For various 
reasons it is simpler to mandate 
these two courses than to give be­
ginning students a wide option, as 
many more complex and diversi­
fied universities have done. In gen­
eral, I believe ours are good 
courses for our people; if I did 
not think they were good college 
level courses for anyone, I would 
not judge them to be good enough 
for the College of Fine Arts. It 
follows that we would be incon­
sistent were we to deny the privi­
lege of taking these courses to 
anyone on campus.
Can Others Benefit?
Within the college we are inte­
grated to the degree that sched­
ules will permit. We do not ex­
clude architects from sections 
which are basically for music 
students, and so on. The long 
laboratory hours required in the 
College make scheduling for mixed 
groups extremely difficult. Be­
cause of our own scheduling pro­
blem, the pattern of classes de­
signed for Fine Arts is apt to be 
unpopular elsewhere on the cam­
pus and this is one practical situa­
tion, I suppose, which keeps us
SC President Urges Frosh 
To Join Student Government
As President of the Student Congress I would like to welcome the 
Class of 1969 to Carnegie Tech. I sincerely hope you enjoyed what we 
planned to be our most comprehensive orientation program.
We have given you the oppor-
tunity to benefit from the numer­
ous campus activities. We hope 
that these extra-curricular activi­
ties as well as the student govern­
ment itself will help you attain a 
well-rounded education at Car­
negie Tech.
Our Student Government is the 
governing organization for all stu­
dent activities. In order to insure 
an efficient student government it 
is necessary to have extensive par­
ticipation by the student body in all 
campus activities.
Student government is concerned 
not only with upper-classmen, but 
freshmen in particular bec aus e 
they will be the future leaders of
the students at Carnegie Tech.
There are 13 committees of Stu­
dent Congress, memberships of 
which are open to all. The com­
mittees perform functions ranging 
from Homecoming and Spring Car­
nival to a new Student Congress 
constitution and student handbook, 
revised student organization bud­
gets, pictured identification cards, 
humor magazine and new student 
union.
Freshmen should not only benefit 
from but contribute to Student Con­
gress and its activities as well.
I hope that you will join with me 
in making the Carnegie Tech Cam­
pus one we can be proud of.
from enrolling students from other 
colleges in these courses. There 
is nothing mystical in Thought and 
Expression or History of Arts and 
Civilization, however, that in it­
self makes either course more or 
less valuable than another course 
in the same field. I happen to 
agree that cultural history for 
people in the arts has more mean­
ing and excites more interest and 
response than does political his­
tory. To an historian who is 
differently oriented, this may seem 
incomprehensible but for many 
people man’s cultural achieve­
ments can be as significant as his 
exchanges of power. Because man 
leaves behind him artifacts that 
can be looked at and evaluated, his 
record in cultural terms is quite 
clear; it does not depend on a 
phrase or value judgement seen 
through an overlay of many years.
Elective Time
Most students in the College 
take a psychology course in the 
third year and thereafter they are 
free to spend their elective time 
on anything that presents itself. A 
year or two ago I made a survey 
of the kinds of courses that art 
students get into at junior and 
senior levels. The range is sur­
prisingly wide, and the number of 
students moving into areas of 
mathematics, science, languages, 
humanities and the arts other than 
their own, surprisingly great. Art­
ists are, after all, people — some­
times, if they are good artists, 
people with perceptions heightened 
by experience and possessing a 
vast curiosity about everything 
that goes on.
We do not of course achieve this 
high state of receptivity with ev­
ery student. No art school does. 
We have our full share of good 
people, however, and in my view 
we are one of the more highly 
favored schools in this respect. 
I have lived among student and 
faculty artists through all of my
days and I assure you they are 
as diverse, as subject to periods 
of exaltation and exhaustion, as 
keenly concerned about the world 
as it is or as it could be, as an­
xious to assist others, as full of 
frailty and nobility, as prone to 
the ordinary and the exotic as 
any other group you can imagine.
The Overprojectors 
Art students tend to respond ex­
ternally to the ideas they are try­
ing to absorb internally. Thus 
drama students who are learning 
how to project, sometimes over­
project in the presence of others.
I suppose this is disturbing to the 
underprojectors around them. In 
the interest of international good 
will and understanding, however, I 
suggest that we could practice on 
this campus a bit of tolerance 
toward those whose ideas are not 
like our own and this applies to the 
painters who look at the actors, the 
actors who look at the musicians, 
the musicians who look at the ar­
chitects and all of the engineers, 
scientists, and humanitarians who 
regard the College of Fine Arts and 
its inhabitants. Some of the most 
luxuriant beards a few years ago 
were being worn (I think) by elec­
trical engineers, though theCol- 
lege of Fine Arts got the credit 
for them. College years are ex­
pressive years and a time when 
young artists (and others) are ra­
pidly growing in their awareness 
of all the possibilities the world 
holds for them. It neither shocks 
nor surprises me when the evi­
dence of this phenomenon is over­
stated and thus badly presented to 
the public view. Eventually a good 
artist learns restraint as well as 
expression. He learns to develop 
his individuality in terms of his 
work rather than his person. At the 
beginning stages it is hard to learn 
everything at once and I guess I for 
one would rather see an over­
statement of personality than a 
flaccid kind of conformity.

1965 Freshman namp
Freshman Camp 1965, held at 
Lutherland Camp near Butler, 
Pennsylvania, was attended by 338 
freshmen (80 more than last year), 
48 counselors, and 15 faculty mem­
bers.
The orientation project was un­
der the direction of Dr. Robert 
Morgan, head of the Bureau of 
Measurement and Guidance, and 
Tom Glassberg, student coordi­
nator .
Before the frosh assured the 
counselors and faculty staff drove 
to Lutherland on September 7 in 
order to rehearse programs and 
finalize plans made last spring. 
Wednesday morning a group of 
counselors returned to lead the 
busloads of incoming freshmen. 
They arrived at camp at appro­
ximately 3 p.m. without mishap, 
with the exception of two buses 
which broke down, were lost and 
rerouted through Coraopolis.
Campers were greeted by their 
cabin counsellors and given a ra­
pid tour of the grounds. This was 
followed by a recreation period in 
which the freshmen showed their 
skill at swimming, volleyball, 
badmitton, basketball, softball, 
football, and frisbee. After din­
ner, the games as well as groups 
of folksinging centering around 
guitarists and harmonica players, 
were interrupted by the surprise 
appearance of the Carnegie Tech 
pipers who performed several se­
lections and introduced Mary Lou 
Ramsey, a freshman experienced 
in highland dancing, who execut­
ed the Shear Truse in full cos­
tume.
At 8 p.m. the freshman were 
formally welcomed and Dr. Rob­
ert Kibbee, assistant to the pres­
ident for planning, delivered the 
keynote address.
In the course of his speech, 
he analyzed the causes of con­
flict between students and fa­
culty at a university.
First, students perceive the ma­
jor role of faculty members to 
be that of teaching them, while 
professors view their responsi­
bility as commitment to three 
areas: research in their parti­
cular fields, community service, 
as well as teaching. Second, fa­
culty members feel that the ma­
jor area of student interest should 
be one of intellectual pursuit, while 
students desire a wider spectrum 
of experience. Third, the univer­
sity itself, represented by its fa­
culty, stresses theory, discipline 
and restraint, while students yearn 
for reality and action. The faculty 
may urge the study of a situa­
tion the civil rights controver­
sy, for example, but discourage 
demonstrations.
Kibbee stated that the Admini­
stration acts as arbitrator in this 
student - faculty split, but ap­
preciates both viewpoints and is 
often unable to completely solve 
the situation. Rather than attempt 
to resolve the conflict, he urged 
the freshmen to exert energy to 
create satisfaction within the 
bounds of both the faculty and the 
student views. He further admon­
ished the freshmen to understand 
the motives of others before char­
ging duplicity on their parts, to 
realize that it is possible for two 
people who disagree honestly to be 
equally correct, and to avoid jud­
ging issues solely in blacks and 
whites.
Following the address, the camp­
ers were free to participate in 
square dancing and folk dancing. 
Ten members of NEFYOU and 
NEECE (two secret agent orga­
nizations dedicated to the eradi­
cation of evil), Ray Boorstein, 
Kay Morgan, Peter Stewart, Chris 
Macosko, Joe Califf, Becky Smith, 
Pat Bonner, Ian Raffel, and Penny 
Reed revealed the presence of an 
enemy Canary agent, Zook, on the 
camp premesis. The danger was 
imminent and all campus pledged 
loyalty to the cause oi his cap­
ture with an intensely spirited 
hate rally. Both freshmen and 
counselors watched for Zook
by Marcy Stern
throughout camp, and checked sus­
picious looking people for the tell­
tale canary marked palms. Thurs­
day night at midnight, Zook tipped 
his hand and was nabbed by the 
alert NEFYOU and NEECE agents. 
Penny Reed, coordinator of the or­
ganizations, reassured the camp­
ers that the area was safe.
Thursday's activities began with 
an optional 7:45 swim which over 
fifty attended. Earle Swank, dean 
of men, reported his dip to be 
very refreshing.
The morning program consisted 
of a series of counselor's state­
ments concerning their views on 
the college experience and their 
goals within that experience which 
were followed by discussion groups 
intended to provoke the freshmen 
into examining their own thoughts 
on the matter.
The presentation was divided into 
two sections in order to accomo­
date the entire group. Bernie Co- 
broski, Carol Kurtz, Frank 
Vigliotti, Beth Carten, BevPhilov- 
sky, Dick Londergan, and George 
Hunter spoke to half of the fresh­
men, The others were addressed 
by Larry Sulak, Lorna Hershber­
ger, Maurice McCall, Marcy Stern, 
Jim Panepinto, Tina Wick, and 
Joe Bowman. The moderators were 
Dr. Robert Parks, drama depart­
ment professor, and Miss Betty 
Jane Lloyd, assistant dean of 
MMCC.
In reflecting their present life 
philosophies, some of the speak­
er's talks were related directly 
to their major area of study, while 
others involved different aspects of 
their college experiences. The 
panel members represented a wide 
range of ideologies and explained, 
for the most part, the manner 
in which each had developed.
Because it had been raining for 
several hours, the small discus­
sion groups met inside auditorium 
rooms. Counselors reported sa­
tisfactory to excellent results in 
their groups and many freshmen 
were heard discussing the ques­
tions posed in them more fully 
after the formal period was con­
cluded. Until lunch time, the more 
ambitious freshmen began spirit­
ed volleyball and basketball games 
by straddling or splashing through 
puddle obstacles on the courts.
The afternoon program involved 
a panel of faculty members who 
spoke on their personal views of 
“The Nature of a University.'’ 
The presentation was again done 
in two sections, the first of which 
was addressed by Ned VanderVen, 
assistant professor, physics, E
& S; Stephen L. Rosen, assistant 
professor, chemical engineering, 
E & S; Ruth Beach, assistant pro­
fessor, Psychology, H & SS; Timo­
thy W. McGuire, research asso­
ciate in Economics, GSIA; and 
Jewel Walker, assistant profes­
sor, Drama, CFA. The second 
group heard Hugh Young, asso­
ciate professor and head, Natural 
Sciences MMCC, associate profes­
sor Physics, E & S; Clayton Mote, 
Jr., assistant professor, Mechani­
cal Engineering, E & S; Shirley 
Angrist, research sociologist, Of­
fice of the Dean, MMCC; Daryl 
Bern, assistant professor Psycho­
logy and GSIA, H & SS; and How­
ard Glasser, assistant professor, 
Graphic Arts and PDS, CFA. The 
panels were moderated by Jow 
Nirschl and Ian Raffel, pro­
gram committee heads.
The faculty viewpoints of the 
major function of a university 
were varied. Ideas of the most 
important role of the university 
included researching rather than 
training students, teaching stu­
dents “ how to think and analyze," 
giving background for student’s 
self-identification processes, ex­
isting as “an active political in­
strument of social change," and 
awakening of a “a student to an 
awareness of his senses and his 
reaction to the things in nature 
around him,"
Another set of discussion groups
met after the panel presentation 
to examine the conflicting con­
cepts. It was reported by both 
campers and counselors that the 
discussion was a difficult one be­
cause freshmen had had no col­
lege experience to support their 
views of what it should be.
In the evening, Marion Bauman, 
camp entertainment chairman, in­
troduced the talent show perfor­
mers. “Mr. Carnegie Tech'’, Rob­
ert Schmertz, emeritus professor 
of architecture, headed the agenda 
with several humerous folk songs 
which he accompanied on a banjo. 
Next, Chuck Gilmore, junior me­
chanical engineering student, sang 
three more classical songs and was 
followed by “We Three,’' the win­
ners of last year's SpringC arnival 
talent competition. The members 
of this folk group are Martha 
Hodgson, Joan Jaques, John Guth, 
Ed Ketterer, and Bill Anderson.
Square dancing was then begun 
on the volleyball courts, and a cof­
fee house opened in a completely 
transformed auditorium. The 
smoke and incensed filled area 
was lined with tables, lit by bird's 
nests, candle holders, spotted with 
charcoal sketchers working on 
portraits of the crazy foam beard­
ed and nosed guests, sleeping bag­
ged campers and poets spouting 
verses from an elementary school 
reader. A Christmas movie and a 
cartoon were projected onto the 
walls foreward the backwards as 
well as right side up and up side 
down. Ballet dancers performed 
piano selections as well as jazz 
records. Guitarists and groups 
of folk singing enthusiasts gath­
ered in the remaining space. 
The “Pot House,” organized by 
Elissa Parker, drew crowds long 
after the coffee supply was ex­
hausted.
Later in the evening the “Crit­
ters,'’ a campus combo, played 
for a large group of dancers. 
The entertainment was conclud­
ed by the cheerleaders and Scotty 
dog who led a pep rally at 12:15.
Friday morning the campers and 
counselors attended an evaluation 
of Freshman Camp delivered by 
Dr. Robert Morgan. He enumerat­
ed the purposes of camp as a gene­
ral orientation of the college ex­
perience and illustrated each ac­
tivities’ part in carrying out this 
purpose.
Soon after his speech the buses 
returned the tired counselors and 
freshmen to the Carnegie Tech 
C ampus.
Frosh Camp?
There might not be any fresh­
man camp for 1966.
For years it has been a mandate 
on the part of the Carnegie Tech 
deans to organize orientation in 
one location. They recognize that 
camp is «very pleasant, especially 
for counselors," but they also feel 
that freshman attending camp — 
and constituting only one third of 
their class — are generally «those 
who do not need it.*
They have considered using a- 
nother camp and running the com­
plete orientation program in that 
location although a number of them 
would be opposed to the resulting 
size of the camp. They have also 
thought of simulating the camp ex­
perience on the Carnegie Tech 
campus or disregarding it entirely 
in favor of a formal program.
In 1963 a survey of student opin­
ion about orientation week was 
conducted by the college which 
showed that the best-attended 
events, in the “administrative* 
category, were also enjoyed the 
least; that freshman camp, although 
relatively poorly attended, was en­
joyed the most.
The deans are aware of these 
findings but they wish to hear more 
current student opinion. We suggest 
that students write the Tartan, c/o 
Box C, Campus Mail.

MDC Prexy Cites Plans
For New Academic Year
by David J. Ritchie 
President, Men’s Dormitory Council
As president of Men's Dormitory Council (MDC), I would like to wel­
come each and every freshman to Carnegie Tech. We hope that your four 
years here will be a most pleasant, interesting, and valuable experience 
for you. ------------------------------------------------
Because you men of the Fresh­
man Class make up over half of 
those students living in the men’s 
dormitories, the members of MDC 
(the majority of whom you and the 
other men’s dormitory residents 
will elect shortly) are particularly 
interested in your views on every­
thing concerning dormitory life— 
from the type of social program 
which we should have to the quality 
of the study conditions which should 
be maintained.
Our interest in yours and the 
other men's dormitory residents' 
opinions and our decisions on such 
matters cannot effectively accom­
plish anything, however, unless we 
have the active participation and 
help of all residents in carrying out 
those decisions. If every men's 
dormitory resident would give us 
this kind of support and a little of 
his time when necessary, we would 
together be able to accomplish 
many things for the benefit of us all.
Our plans this year, which with 
your support will be realized, in-

Tech To Offer 
New Program 
In Sciences
A graduate program in earth 
and astronomical sciences is being 
offered in the College of Engineer­
ing and Science at Carnegie Tech 
this semester.
The program is under the dir­
ection of a committee headed by 
Truman P. Kohman, professor of 
chemistry.
Masters and doctoral programs 
have been initiated in the earth 
sciences and include geology, geo­
chemistry and oceanography.
An undergraduate course in 
earth science is available to stu­
dents who have completed fresh­
man and sophomore mathematics, 
physics and freshman chemistry. 
Each semester will carry 12 units 
of credit, including three units of 
laboratory and field work.
These courses are offered as 
part of the Inter-disciplinary Pro­
gram in Earth and Astronomical 
Sciences and will serve a variety 
of needs: (1) to enable students in 
all departments of the College of 
Engineering and Science to broaden 
their scientific backgrounds; (2) 
to provide undergraduates in basic 
science or engineering who might 
be considering some field of earth 
science for graduate study at Car­
negie Tech or elsewhere (3) to 
provide an introduction and over­
view of the field and (4) to give 
new graduate students in the Earth 
and Astronomical Sciences Pro­
gram whose basic training has been 
in other fields an introduction to 
earth science.
Earth Science, one which is being 
given this semester, will consider 
mainly the solid earth, its surface 
features, its interior, its materials 
and processes on both short and 
long time scales. The spring se­
mester, Earth Science two, will 
consider the oceans, the atmos­
phere, as well as the biosphere 
and the interactions between the 
various parts.
Ronald G. Ostic, assistant pro­
fessor of geophysics from the Uni­
versity of California at San Diego, 
Edward J. Green, assistant pro­
fessor of geochemistry, Ralph 
Gagnon, assistant professor of 
electrical engineering and radio 
astronomy, and Alexander B. Spen­
cer instructor in geology, are join­
ing the Carnegie Tech faculty for 
the new program.
Carnegie Tech does not intend 
to provide complete course offer­
ings in this area. Through a co­
operative arrangement with the 
University of Pittsburgh, Carne­
gie Tech students can take courses 
in Pitt’s Department of Earth and 
Planetary Sciences. Pitt students 
can also take Tech courses.
Further plans for the program 
include additions to the staff, 
course offerings and degree pro­
grams in the astronomical scien­
ces.
of dormitory residents’ participa­
tion in intramurals through the 
formation of dormitory teams, (3) 
improvement of present recrea­
tional equipment and purchase of 
additional items, and (4) dis­
cussions with the administration on 
the criteria for the ideal dormi­
tory, and ways to make the pre­
sent ones approach the ideal. Fin­
ally, we also invite any men's 
dormitory resident to come and 
discuss with us any suggestions he 
has for change and improvement in 
the men's dormitories.

Tech’s Tartans Knuckle Down 
For Onrushing 1965 Season
Coach Joe Gasparella’s Carnegie Tech Tartans open the 1965 football season at Wooster College Sept. 25 
with a squad of 32 players, including 14 freshmen. Only eight lettermen, four backs and four linemen, are 
back from last year’s team which won one game and lost seven.
Sophomore Tom Hubka, who let-
Tartan Harriers To teet
For Fall Sports Practice
tered last season while sharing the 
quarterback duties with graduated 
senior Paul Wisniewski, is back. 
So is fullback Dick*Smokey* Mer­
rill, who gained over 700 yards 
rushing in 8 games last year 
and was elected to the All-Dis­
trict small college team. Merrill, 
a senior, is one of the co-captains.
Two more lettermen in the back- 
field are running back Chuck Zak 
and flanker Dick Bell, both sopho­
mores. Promising new prospects 
are 205-pound quarterback Larry 
Getto and running backs Jim Wil­
liams and Dave Thomas.
At center, Coach Gasparella will 
rely on 160-pound Ron Horn, a 
freshmen from Garrett Park, 
Maryland. Two experienced let­
termen, juniors Pete Bair and 
Bill Patula, return at the guard po­
sitions. Pete’s brother Larry, a 
freshmen, is also out for guard.
One tackle post will probably 
be filled by Glenn DeRusha, who 
lettered last year as a freshman. 
Other tackle candidates include 
sophomore Bruce Burggraf, a 6’2*, 
200-pounder, and freshmen Har­
ry Dodds and Jeff Klein.
The other Tech co-captain, sen­
ior Bill Coleman, is at end. Soph­
omore Nick Lyman, 6'2* and 180 
pounds, and freshman Ken Stalker, 
6’4* and 205 pounds, are also after 
end positions.
Six-foot-two, 200-pound junior 
Jim Clark, who was on the team 
as a freshman, is back again and 
could play flanker or end.
Last year Carnegie Tech, which 
does not give athletic scholarships, 
beat Case Tech of Cleveland 21-6 
and lost 27-0 to Wooster, 32-13 to 
Grove City, 18-14 to Franklin & 
Marshall, 13-3 to Allegheny, 27-7 
to Denison, 39-0 to powerful West­
minster, and 21-6 to Washington & 
Jefferson.
After this years opener on Sat­
urday, September 25 at Wooster, 
Tech plays at Case Tech October 
2, Allegheny (home) October 9, 
at Grove City October 16, Frank­
lin & Marshall (homecoming game) 
October 23, Denison (home) Octo­
ber 30, at Westminster November 
6, and Washington & Jefferson at 
home on November 13.
The «winningest* athletic team in Carnegie Tech’s history, the cross 
country squad starts practive this week. This afternoon at 4;30 in the 
locker room below Donner Hall the team will hold its first meeting. All 
interested freshmen are invited.
Stretching back to.the 1961 sea­
son, the Tartan harriers (sports 
talk for long distance runners) 
have won 33 meets in a row. There 
is no one now on the squad who can 
remember a defeat.
Carl Olson, Tech’s grizzly coach 
and former Pitt track mentor and 
Olympic team head, credits *a 
real spirit and hard work* to the 
team’s amazing record. “You can’t 
get anything without putting out for 
it,* says Coach Olson.
Returning are five lettermen 
from last season. Junior and Most 
Valuable Player for two years, 
Harry Burkholder, promises to
lead the team again. Senior Chris 
Macosko’s course record of 23 
minutes one second should be brok­
en early in the season. Roger 
Cairns, a fleet-footed junior in 
P & D, may be the one to do it. 
Other lettermen are lean sopho­
more Tom Keim and hard fighting 
Kem Phillips. Other returning var­
sity members include Herb D’Alo, 
Dave Simons, Denny Collins and 
Russ Jones.
The team’s home course is a 4.3 
mile run through the rugged hills 
of Schenley Park. Races begin at 
the base of Flagstaff Hill across 
from Scaife Hall.

BTP Wins I.M. Trophy
Edges Out G.S.I.A. Teams
With a total of 45 intramural points Beta Theta Pi won the 1964-1965 
Intramural All Sports Trophy. Beta edged out G.S.I.A. by one point to be 
the first fraternity to win the trophy in five years.
G.S.I.A. finished second with a ¦--------------
44 point total; the Grad Nads were 
third with 38 points. With 27 points,
ATO was fourth and SAE fifth with 
26 points.
Beta received points in 11 out of 
21 intramural sports. School 
championships were captured by 
the Betas in basketball track, golf, 
rifle, and foul shooting. The Betas 
placed second in football and 
wrestling and also won points in 
volleyball, badminton, table ten­
nis, and squash.
G.S.I.A, was the champion in 
football, tennis, water polo, and 
squash. G.S.I.A also scored points 
in softball, track, co-rec volley­
ball, table tennis, bowling, golf 
and basketball.
The Grad Nads came along 
strongly at the end of the year 
to place third overall. The Nads 
won the championship in softball, 
and all spring sports. They also 
captured points in squash, track, 
six-man volleyball and basketball.
Alpha Tau Omega received 
points in swimming, foul shooting, 
co-rec volleyball, basketball, 
water polo, rifle, and won the 
school bowling title.
Sitma Alpha Epsilon won its 
26 points by making a clean sweep 
of the volleyball sports. SAE took 
first and third in six-man volley­
ball, first in co-rec volleyball and 
first in three-man volleyball.
For the past 5 years the Grad 
Eagles had run away with the All- 
Sports Trophy scoring an average 
of 30 points over its nearest rival. 
The 1964-65 season was the first 
year that the grad teams split up 
into two major teams. The volun­
tary split by the graduate students 
into the Nads and G.S.I.A. teams 
proved to provide an interesting 
and highly competitive race for the 
All Sports Trophy.
The outcome of the trophy was 
not decided until the last I.M. 
competition of the year, which was 
a handball match to determine the 
third place winner in that sport 
worth one point between Beta Sig­
ma Rho and G.S.I.A. Beta Sig won 
the event depriving G.S.I.A. the 
one point they needed to tie Beta 
for the Trophy.

I had little trouble finding a seat in Scaife Hall Auditorium at 4 p.m. 
last Wednesday. I was there to cover a story on “The Civil Rights 
Movement — Does it Have a Future?**
Seated at the panel were three members of Carnegie Tech's history 
department and the head of the Pittsburgh NAACP. The gallery consisted 
mostly of members of the community although several Carnegie Tech 
students were present.
Dr. Irving H. Bartlett, head of 
the department, introduced the 
first speaker, Eugene Levy. Levy 
traced the Civil Rights movement 
from the days of Reconstruction 
which saw the dispairing Negro 
isolated in the South and the com­
plaisant White willing to take ad­
vantage of his weakness. The fede­
ral government would not ally the 
Civil Rights cause of that time as 
the Negro was considered a poli­
tical handicap. Civil Rights lead­
ers admitted defeat to the adverse 
public opinion.
In the first decade of this cen­
tury the NAACP was formed with 
the goal of opening social, politi­
cal, and economic opportunities 
to the Negro. Slowly the way was 
opened so that today the Negro is 
the “master of his own fate.”
With this relative “establishment 
of power’* he has forced the com­
mitment of the federal govern­
ment. This commitment along with 
a winning fight against despair and 
complaisancy will insure a future 
for Civil Rights.
Professor David Fowler, the 
second speaker, had a more 
pessimistic view. He spoke of the 
achievement of secondary aims, 
mostly since World War II, in the 
fields of education, job opportuni­
ties and property rights. He cited 
the main goal, however, as being 
respect and self respect. Projects 
such as “Head start*' are alright 
for the time but do not have the 
dedication of the white communi­
ty. Fowler defined his goal of total 
respect as the day when intermar­
riage is not only accepted but com­
monplace - a day far in the future 
indeed.
The last speaker on the program 
was Mr. Brown, head of the Pitts­
burgh NAACP. He came with no 
notes, no facts nor figures. He 
simply expressed a feeling that one 
must live in order to understand.
The feeling that was the real story 
behind the demonstrations and de­
spair - the fact that (think of 
yourself in this position) “I am a 
Negro” and no matter how many 
political victories I win or how 
much money I make I am still a 
Negro and when I meet a white 
man I can see in his eyes that I 
am a Negro.
Brown could not answer specific
Tobey Exhibit 
OpenThrough 
November 5
A collection of sketches and 
paintings by Mark Tobey, winner 
of the Pittsburgh International in 
1961, will be on display in Hew­
lett Gallery, Fine Arts through 
Friday, November 5.
The exhibition entitled “Seattle 
Market Place Sketches” contains 
45 sketches of the Seattle land­
mark as well as paintings.
Tobey, 75, is now living in 
Basel, Switzerland. He lived in 
Seattle for many and turned out 
the sketches and paintings between 
1939 and 1942 after having traveled 
widely in Europe and the Orient.
His sketches were done in small 
Chinese notebooks. According to 
critics “The delicate paper proved 
especially appropriate for Tobey’s 
mood-filled expression of mar­
ket’s character and personalities 
he found there.”
From these studies, Tobey de­
veloped a series of oil and tem­
pera easel paintings, of which four 
are in the exhibition. The show was 
gathered together from 16 private 
collectors, one gallery and the 
Seattle Museum of Art and was 
organized for circulation by The 
Museum of Modern Art in New 
York.
Tobey became nationally known 
in 1944 after a one-man show was 
held at the Willard Gallery in New 
York. In 1946 he was included in 
The Museum of Modern Art’s 
’Fourteen Americans. In 1958 he 
was awarded the first prize of 
the Commune of Venice for his 
paintings at the XXIX Biennale, 
becoming the first American to 
be so honored since Whistler in 
1895. In 1962 a large exhibition 
of his work was staged by The 
Museum of Modern Art.

Choir To Perform 
For Tech Alumni 
At Homecoming
Carnegie Tech alumni will re­
turn on Homecoming to hear a con­
cert given by the Cameron Choir.
The choir, formed 13 years ago, 
is made up of approximately 65 
male and female singers.
Robert L. Camp, director of the 
choir, is also supervisor of music 
for the Wilklnsburg Public Schools. 
He received his master's degree 
in music at Tech in 1953. Besides 
the fact that Andrew Carnegie used 
the Cameron plaid, the students 
felt the name had the right sound, 
according to Mr. Camp.
All of the departments on Car­
negie Tech are represented in the 
choir. Auditions are held twice a 
year at the beginning of each 
semester. There are generally 
more than 60 candidates and any 
over that number are used as 
alternates to fill in when the aca­
demic schedules keep members at 
their books.
The choir usually meets twice a 
week — after regular class hours 
— in Mary Breed Hall In Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie College.
When performing for Carnegie 
Tech alumni, the choir includes a 
sing-a-long session of campus 
songs, usually reserved for the 
end of the program. The students 
give two formal concerts a year, 
usually at the end of each semester. 
They also give three or four con­
certs a year at district high 
schools.
The choir also travels for alumni 
concerts. They have performed In 
New York City, Columbus, Erie, 
Philadelphia, Hartford, Washing­
ton and Baltimore. On many of 
these trips the choir also sings 
at high schools.
They have also performed on 
radio and television. Locally, the 
Camerons have performed in Car­
negie Music Hall and Stephen Fos­
ter Memorial.
“Music is the only thing I know 
of where you can use your voca­
tion as a hobby — I do it every 
day and still love it,” said Mr. 
Camp. When asked about his 
schedule, he replies: “It does make 
for a full week.*

Alumna Displays 
Watercolors 
In Hunt Library
An exhibition of more than 100 
original drawings and water colors 
of botanical illustrations by Mrs. 
Anne Ophelia Todd Dowden is on 
display at Carnegie Tech's Hunt 
Botanical Library.
The exhibition marks the first 
one-man show at Carnegie Tech of 
Botanical illustrations by an alum­
na. Mrs. Dowden graduated in 1930 
with a degree from the College of 
Fine Arts and continued her stu­
dies at the Art students League 
and the Beaux Art Institute of De­
sign in New York.
On three occasions, she was a 
Tiffany Foundation Fellow. She 
taught at Pratt Institute and was 
chairman of the art departmental 
Manhattanville College for 20 
years.
Full-color spreads of her botan­
ical illustrations have appeared in 
numerous issues of Life, Natural 
History Magazine and House Beau­
tiful. More recently she has been 
both author and illustrator of pop­
ular books specializing on such 
subjects as birds and flowers. 
Among them are Look at A Flow­
er (1963), The Secret Life of Flow­
ers 0964) and the latest Roses. 
Copies of these will be part of the 
display.
Much material of special inte­
rest to students of graphic arts 
and book design has been includ­
ed by her publisher, The Odyssey 
Press. This includes preliminary 
sketches, working drawing draw­
ings, progressive color proofs and 
ozalid prints. Not all of Mrs. 
Dowden's work will be on display.
The exhibition will be open to 
faculty, students and the public 
every Monday through Friday from 
1 to 5 p.m. until next May.
The exhibit will be open to the 
public from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. 
on Thursday, October 21 and Sat­
urday October 23.

Grove nity Stops Tech, 28-0, 
Wolverines’ Defense Tough
by Larry Sikon
Wolverine Defensive End Joe Stupar Chases Tech’s Larry Getto
Tartan Photo by John Mera
Homecoming was happy at Grove City College last Saturday as the 
defense and rolled to a 28-0 victory overWolverines played fierce 
Carnegie Tech’s Tartans.
The Grovers completely bottled 
up the usually dangerous Tech 
passing attack, limiting them to a 
gain of only 71 yards passing, 
The Tartans’ ground attack was not 
a poor one, picking up 152 yards, 
but it was not enough to push over 
a score.
The first half was almost en­
tirely a defensive struggle, with no 
scoring being done until late in the 
second quarter. The Tartans won 
the toss and chose to receive. Af­
ter an exchange of downs, the Tar­
tans began what was to be one of 
their biggest scoring threats of the 
day.
On fourth down and eight for the 
Tartans on their own 30-yard line, 
Jim Williams was brought in to 
punt. His kick was a high, 30-yard 
boot which landed among a group 
of Grove City players, but, in the 
confusion, one of the Grovers 
touched the ball and an alert Tar­
tan quickly jumped on it to re­
claim possession for Tech.
Two 7-yard gains for Larry 
Getto and a Wolverine penalty put 
the Tartans on the Grove C ity 18- 
yard line. But two Tech penalties, 
one a 15-yarder, quickly moved the 
Tartans out of scoring position and 
killed the threat.
After this both teams were un­
able to move the ball successful­
ly until late in the 2nd quarter 
when Grove City started its first 
scoring drive. After a 15-yard 
run by Thom Shear, Mike Zeigler 
tossed a 40-yard pass to his right 
end, Ken Wyman, on the Tech 21- 
yard line.
Two plays later, zeigler threw a 
20-yard aerial to Tom Behr, and, 
with Barry Ross's successful con­
version, the Wolverines led 7-0 
at the half.
In the second half, the Grovers 
quickly added another score when, 
on third down and 20 yards to go 
from their own 17 yard line, Mike 
Zeigler daringly went to the air 
and found Behr downfield. Behr 
grabbed the pass on the sidelines, 
eluded a couple of tacklers, and 
went all the way. Ross added the 
PAT and the Wolverines led 14-0.
TiiP Grovers added two more 
touchdown^ in the final quarter 
when Bob ifctwns ran the ball inÖQwns
from the Tech 1 and Russ Snead 
caught a 9-yard pass from Tom 
Philips in the end zone. Ross and 
Emil Solomon added the extra 
points to make the final score 28-0 
in favor of Grove C ity.
Individual leaders for the Wol­
verines were halfback Thom Shear 
(65 yards rushing), and quarter­
back Mike Zeigler. Zeigler only 
completed 4 passes, but they were 
good for 152 yards.
The big men on the Grove City 
team, though, were those on the de­
fensive unit. By frequent blitzing, 
they managed to keep Tom Hubka 
from throwing the long bomb and 
they stopped the Tartan ground 
attack every time it threatened.
Larry Getto and ailing Dick 
Merrill carried the ball for 34 and 
36 yards respectively for Tech.
Tech, now 1 and 3, plays host to 
Franklin and Marshall Saturday at 
1:30 in the Homecoming game. 
Last year an undefeated F & M 
team nipped Tech 18 to 14, and 
the Tartans will be out to gain 
revenge in front of the home fans.

Eight Teams 
Gain Spots In
1.M. Playoffs
by Charles Beard 
Intramural football playoffs 
started yesterday with the two top 
teams in each league participat­
ing. SAE, GSIA “D", PIKA, ATO, 
BTO, GSIA *«F”, the Grad Dads, 
and the E.J.'s go at each other to 
determine an all-school champion.
SAE, Beta Theta Pi and the 
Grad Nads all got through league 
play undefeated as the regular 
season closed out last Sunday.
In the Browns League 
Top-seeded PiKA moved into the 
playoffs by sweeping three big 
games. They dumped previously 
unbeaten ATO 16-9, beat TDP 13- 
8 on Dennis Cash's last-period 
runback of an intercepted pass, 
then coasted past Kappa Sig 20-9. 
ATO swamped the Grad Nads **B" 
69-14 to ice the other playoff 
berth. TDP scored a TD on the 
last play of the game to upend 
the stubborn Dorm Trojans 33- 
29. The Trojans then gave the 
Nads *«B" a perfect record by 
handing them a 33-19 loss. PiKA 
and ATO played again Monday to 
determine first place. Final stan­
dings; ATO and PKA 4-1, TDP 
and Dorm-Trojans 3-2, KS 1-4, 
and Nads *«B" 0-5.
In the Eagles League 
Underestimated SAE shocked 
GSIA *«D", last year's school 
champions, 24 to 3 to capture first 
place. GSIA settled for second, 
beating the Civil Hammers 27-16 
and scoring 24 points in the last 
quarter to break open a tight de­
fensive game and eliminateDU 25-
2. In other action the Architects 
beat TDP “B" 13-6. Standings; 
SAE 5-0, GSIA **D’» 4-1, DU 3-2, 
Civil Hammers and Architects 1-4, 
and TDP *‘B” 0-5.
In the Giants League 
The Grad Nads brushed off their 
competition to take first, beating 
BSR 29-8 and BTP "B" 36-19. 
GSIA **F" captured second by al­
so beating BSR 22-4 and by de­
feating the Laundrymen 27 - 9. 
Other defeating the Laundrymen

Grad Nads 6-0, GSIA “F" 5-1, 
BSR 4-2, BTP *‘B” 3-3, DTD 2- 
4 Laundrymen 1-5, and SN **B'' 
0-6.
In the Steelers League
Beta Theta Pi coasted to first 
place. They beat PKT 32-2 and SN 
32-14. The surprising E.J.'s grab­
bed second place, taking SN 26 to 
24 and then knocking over the Civil 
Nails 14-11. Final standings; BTP 
5-0, E.J.'s 4-1, Civil Nails 3-2, 
SN 2-3, PKT 1-4, and ATO “B" 
0-5.
Frats vs. Independents
Coming up this Friday at 1;30 
p.m. is the annual I.M. All - 
Star game. This year it will be 
changed a little; in the past it has 
always been the Eagles and Steel­
ers Leagues against the Browns 
and Giants Leagues, but this year 
the fraternity all - stars will battle 
the combined grads, dorms, and in­
dependents. This should make for a 
very interesting game.

F & t
Bethany Ties Tech 
In Cross - Country
by Chris Macosko
Carnegie Tech's four-year streak of success in cross-country 
was nearly ruined this past week as a fired-up Bethany team tied the | 
Tartans 28-28 last Wednesday at Bethany.
In a triangular meet at Cleve­
land on Saturday, the Tartans ed­
ged Case Tech by a point, 27-28, 
and crushed John Carroll 18-39, 
stretching their ««undefeated'’ 
string to 40, although the ««win­
ning” streak was broken.
It was Carnegie Tech’s first 
encounter with either Bethany or 
Case. Both schools were aware 
of Tech's winning streak and were 
out to break it.
Bethany Was Ready
Running can be psychological, 
and Bethany, a West Virginia 
cross-country power with a 50-4 
record over the last five years, 
used this to its advantage. Smart­
ing from a 24-31 upset at the hands 
of Case the week before, Bethany 
even practiced on Sunday to get 
ready for Tech.
Herb D'Alo's car broke down 
on the way to Bethany with half 
the Tech team aboard. When the 
Tartans finally arrived, they were 
somewhat taken aback by the un­
familiar Bethany course, which 
features a 200-yard vertical hill 
at the 2-1/2 mile mark.
Tech's Harry Burkholder walk­
ed the hill but still took first in 
21; 26, one second off the course 
record. After that, though, Be­
thany’s depth told.
Chris Macosko couldn't catch 
Bethany's Rick Ward and finished 
third. Eric Levine and Roger
Cairns took sixth and seventh for 
Tech, and Kem Phillips managed 
eleventh. Bethany had second, 
fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth, and 
tenth, and the five low places ad­
ded up to 28 for a tie.
A Treacherous Course
At Case, the school that beat Be­
thany, the shaken Tartans saw ano­
ther unorthodox course, one that 
combines confusing repeated loops 
in an open field with a tortuous 
path over creek beds and fallen 
trees. And the Case course is 
mostly level, a difficult change- 
of-pace for the Schenley Park 
hill-and-gully runners of Tech.
Case’s twin stars, Gary Stern 
and Jim Papp, took first and sec­
ond in 21;26 and 22;44, pulling 
away from Burkholder. But Burk­
holder, Cairns, and Macosko all 
finished at 22;48, and Levine took 
sixth at 23;13 despite falling in a 
ravine.
The final margin of victory was 
provided by hard-driving Kem 
Phillips, who nosed out Case's 
fifth man for ninth place.
This week's contests should be 
a little easier with Geneva at 4; 30 
this afternoon and St. Francis at 
11;30 a.m. Saturday, both at home. 
Waynesburg is the next big hurdle, 
away next Wednesday. They have 
a rough course and several promi­
sing new runners.
