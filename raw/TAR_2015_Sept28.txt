Indian Ambassador Verma visits CMU
VALENE MEZMIN
Staffwriter
U.S. Ambassador to India 
Richard Rahul Verma visited 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
campus last Wednesday. 
The ambassador spoke 
about his personal connection 
to Pittsburgh and its Indian 
community, the growing re-
lationship between America 
and India, and how India will 
grow and thrive in the future. 
It was, in essence — “Why In-
dia Matters.” The Indian pop-
ulation in America has been 
steadily increasing in recent 
years. 
There are more than three 
million Indian Americans in 
the U.S. alone, and, accord-
ing to University President 
Subra Suresh, “This is the 
group with the highest family 
income in the US.”
The same increase in the 
Indian-American population 
re?ected at Carnegie Mellon. 
Founded by Andrew Carnegie, 
a native of Scotland, Carn-
egie Mellon values the impor-
tance of diverse international 
contributions.
Verma traces his roots just 
up north; the ambassador 
was born in Edmonton, Can-
ada. His father taught Eng-
lish at the University of Pitts-
burgh, specializing in Indian 
Literature. 
Verma knows the Pitts-
burgh area well and calls 
himself a lifelong Steelers fan. 
When re?ecting on his times 
in western Pennsylvania, Am-
bassador Verma described 
his family ?rst arriving here 
broke in a station wagon, but 
still feeling welcomed with 
open arms. “I really do think 
there is something special 
about this area, and what im-
migrants in particular have 
done in this area,” Verma said.
Verma stressed that edu-
cation is a vital part to the 
immigrant story. 
For many immigrants, edu-
cation is their motivation be-
hind leaving their homelands 
and undergoing the arduous 
task of starting over in a new 
country. Because of this, many 
immigrant children value 
education from an early age.
Ambassador Verma re?ect-
ed on his time growing up with 
his parents and grandmother, 
who were teachers. He invited 
the audience to picture just 
how strongly the importance 
of education was imposed on 
him at a young age.
“You can imagine growing 
up in a house with two Indian 
teachers as your parents,” 
Verma said.
He then recounted a par-
ticular memory of him coming 
home in ninth grade with his 
report card. It reported ?ve A’s 
and one A-. 
For the next three days he 
was plagued with questions of 
concern from his parents over 
the dreaded A-.
“ ‘What could have hap-
pened? Was there a problem 
with the teacher? Did you not 
study?’ ” they asked.
“No matter where you 
come from, access to educa-
tion can be the ladder that 
helps you climb from one so-
cial class to another and is 
the ultimate key to achieving 
the American dream,” Verma 
said, citing values already 
familiar to many Carnegie 
Mellon students.
Verma also talked about 
the importance of personal 
connections — it is not only 
what you know, but who you 
know. India and America

As the Syrian Civil War 
rages on, Syrian refugees are 
looking anywhere to escape 
the violence. 
One Syrian refugee fam-
ily ?ed from Aleppo to Iraq, 
where, without adequate hu-
manitarian aid, they lacked 
access to education, work, 
and even food and shelter. 
The family of fourteen was 
forced to live in an aban-
doned construction lot beside 
a major highway.
Senior Advocate for the 
Middle East at the D.C. non-
pro?t Refugees International 
Daryl Grisgraber encounters 
refugee families similar to 
the one described. 
On Wednesday, Grisgra-
ber met an eager 130 mem-
bers of the Carnegie Mellon 
community at Baker Hall’s 
Steinberg Auditorium for her 
discussion “Refugees from 
the Syrian Crisis: Re?ections 
on the Changing Needs and 
the International Response.” 
The event was hosted by 
the student organization Fa-
cilitating Opportunities for 
Refugee Growth and Em-
powerment (FORGE), and 
the Center for International 
Relations and Politics (CIRP).
Senior decision science 
and public policy major, and 
co-president of FORGE Rosii 
Floreak explained the pur-
pose of the event. “We re-
ally just wanted to get more 
awareness on campus,” Flo-
reak said. “We wanted to give 
people the opportunity to 
learn more about the Syrian 
and Iraq crises.”
Since the Syrian Civil 
War began ?ve years ago, 4 
million people have ?ed the 
country, 7.5 million are inter-
nally displaced, and 12 mil-
lion still inside Syria rely on 
humanitarian aid. 
According to Grisgraber, 
only 1 percent of the millions 
of refugees throughout the 
world are resettled by the 
United Nations (UN) each 
year. The UN High Commis-
sioner for Refugees deter-
mines who is a refugee and 
who can be resettled, yet of-
?cial refugee status is still no 
guarantee of safety. 
Usually, being approved 
for resettlement as a refu-
gee requires a critical medi-
cal condition, an unaccom-
panied minor, or a case of 
torture. The process can be 
‘Taste of the Tartans’ event showcases campus vendors 
TORREY HART
Junior Staffwriter
One question prevails 
throughout the hectic day of 
the average college student: 
“What should I eat?”
Once a year, Carnegie Mel-
lon Dining Services attempts 
to answer this question.
Taste of the Tartans, an an-
nual event that showcases the 
dining options at Carnegie 
Mellon, occured on Tuesday,  
September 22. Vendors ?lled 
Rangos Ballroom in the Uni-
versity Center, prepared to of-
fer students and staff a taste of 
what they’re all about.
Head of University Din-
ing Services Pascal Petter de-
scribed to The Tartan what 
the event means to him: “It’s 
truly an opportunity to give 
the community the chance to 
try our services, and for us to 
showcase the diversity of the 
dining program.”
Indeed, the event was di-
verse. The 35 vendors in 14 
different buildings at Carnegie 
Mellon include every type of 
cuisine from Japanese to Med-
iterranean, with options for 
every possible dietary restric-
tion. Petter stressed that the 
event is not just for students, 
but also for the larger commu-
nity of faculty and staff, many 
of whom eat the majority of 
their meals on campus.
The university’s dining 
system is drastically different 
than that of other schools. 
Instead of the typical dining 
hall ?lled with soft-serve yo-
gurt, pizza, and other tempt-
ing treats, the Carnegie Mel-
lon system makes it easy for 
students to keep up a healthy 
lifestyle if they so choose.
In addition to the food at-
tractions, Carnegie Mellon’s 
Peer Health Advocates made 
an appearance at the event. 
Representatives from the or-
ganization manned a trivia ta-
ble where students could spin 
a wheel to answer questions 
about nutrition, learn impor-
tant facts, and receive prizes.
The advocates, also Carn-
egie Mellon students, were 
there to emphasize maintain-
ing a diet that supports the 
many activities in which stu-
dents participate. According to 
the Harvard School of Public 
Health, for each meal, half of 
the plate should be fruits and 
vegetables, a quarter of the 
plate should be whole grains, 
and the ?nal quarter should be 
sources of high protein.
Students and staff alike en-
joyed the event. “I’m absolute-
ly enjoying it and I do every 
year. I’m here [on-campus] all 
the time, and it can be dif?cult 
to get away from my regular 
routine and try something 
new,” Bonnie Lack said, who 
works in the Financial Aid De-
partment.
Vendors offered samples 
of some of their most popular 
items from La Prima cappuc-
cinos to The Pomegranate’s 
falafel sandwiches to El Gallo 
de Oro’s burrito bowls.
When asked about the 
event, Psychology Department 
research assistant Mary Mac-
Whinney said, “I think that 
they’ve outdone themselves, 
it’s so generous. I particularly 
like the mashed potatoes and 
meatloaf.”
Chris Bovard from the 
Carnegie Mellon PNC of?ce 
told The Tartan, “I wish this 
was everyday. Everything I’ve 
tried is great.”
While students were eager 
to try the free samples, some 
expressed their concern with 
the dining system as a whole.
“I’m a sophomore and both 
times I’ve gone the samples 
have been better than the food 
we actually get for meals,” 
said sophomore biology major 
Sandra Ho.
The food offered at Taste 
of the Tartans was the best of 
what the vendors have to offer, 
which is not always available 
to students every day. 
However, not all students 
are disappointed in the eating 
accommodations on-campus. 
Sophomore chemical engi-
neering major Sarah Winget 
noted that she “loves going to 
Resnik, because they have so 
many different options.”
“I just stumbled upon this 
event and there is so much 
food and variety, and it really 
showcases what we have on 
campus,” ?rst-year undeclared 
Dietrich student Julia Adams 
said.
Regardless of the reality of 
the CMU dining system, Taste 
of the Tartans expressed the 
University’s interest in student 
welfare.

Assistant physics profes-
sor Shirley Ho, who works in 
the ?elds of cosmology and 
astrophysics, has been of?-
cially recognized as a great 
contributor to answering the 
ultimate question: How did 
we get here?
This year, Ho was named 
an Emmy Noether Fellow, 
“an international award 
for young faculty members 
seeking to do collabora-
tive research,” according to 
a university press release. 
Ho’s collaborative research 
stressed heavily the subject of 
dark energy, helping her gain 
the 2014 Outstanding Young 
Researcher Award, an an-
nual award provided by the 
International Organization 
for Chinese Physicists and 
Astronomers.
On dark energy, Ho gives 
very simple explanations for 
her very complex work. “In 
the children’s museum, when 
you drop a coin and it goes 
around in the center — that’s 
gravity. Imagine a force that 
does the opposite. We’re try-
ing to ?gure out what that is,” 
Ho said.
The answer to the funda-
mental nature of gravity lies 
in Ho’s work: “People like to 
call [universal data collec-
tion] data mining or big data 
— really, I’m just looking to 
make sure I get all the inter-
esting physics that you may 
not expect from the massive 
amount of data,” Ho said in 
the university press release. 
Ho analyzes this data, search-
ing for intuitive ways to re-
work essential theories like 
the Big Bang or the theory of 
gravity.
Ho’s international impor-
tance in the ?eld of cosmol-
ogy is remarkable for Carne-
gie Mellon’s recognition, and 
its strong support of women 
in technical ?elds. Carnegie 
Mellon’s female-to-male ratio 
in the cosmology department 
is one of the highest in the 
world, according to the uni-
versity press release.
Cosmologist named Emmy Noether Fellow
Finance Alum gives personal advice
Carnegie Mellon’s stu-
dents are not unfamiliar with 
the costs that come with be-
ing a student in a top tier 
institution, nor are they un-
familiar with student debt. 
With Carnegie Mellon’s stu-
dent population increasing, 
more students graduate ?nd-
ing themselves in debt.
CEO of BNY Mellon 
Wealth Management (and 
Carnegie Mellon alum) Don-
ald J. Heberle (‘94 GSIA) 
wishes to give personal ?-
nancial advice to current 
students so they can avoid 
this future. 
“Diversi?cation and dis-
cipline — that’s pretty fun-
damental,” Heberle said 
in a press release from the 
university. Students leav-
ing Carnegie Mellon should 
take this to heart, and it 
should not be very dif?cult, 
as the concept of diversity is 
a key talking point at a uni-
versity whose most recent 
class is more than 54% non-
white. Diverse portfolios 
are constantly on Herberle’s 
mind, as he is the head of 
wealth management for the 
?fth largest bank in the U.S. 
Heberle keeps a steady focus 
by removing emotion into 
his work. “Good investors 
are disciplined in terms of 
sticking to a plan. Emotion, 
almost every time, works to 
the disadvantage of an inves-
tor — you tend to make the 
wrong decision at exactly 
the wrong time,” Herberle 
said of investment.
Herberle did have fore-
boding words for students. 
Even with the recent market 
corrections, Herberle said, “I 
de?nitely think there’s more 
volatility ahead,” so a quick 
rush into investment for stu-
dents still in debt would not 
be the most prudent idea. 
All students really need to 
remember is that diversity 
is key.
Boehner announces resignation from speaker of the house position
INTERNATIONAL NEWS IN BRIEF
WASHINGTON — House 
Speaker John Boehner an-
nounced his resignation Fri-
day morning in a meeting 
with fellow Republicans. The 
announcement came amid 
a struggle to avert a govern-
ment shutdown next week. 
The shutdown is now less 
likely to occur because of 
Boehner’s decision. 
Boehner had also been 
under pressure from increas-
ingly conservative members 
of the Republican Party. 
These members, outspoken 
Tea Party advocates, threat-
ened to vote against him, 
alligning with democrats. 
This is mostly because strong 
conservatives do not appre-
ciate the way that Boehner 
has handled congress in the 
important position.
He intends to leave at the 
end of October.

September 28, 2015 « The Tartan thetartan.org/news » A3
long — Grisgraber described 
cases where client refugees 
died while waiting to com-
plete the resettlement process.
The enormous number of 
Syrian and Iraqi refugees has 
overwhelmed neighboring 
host countries such as Leba-
non, Jordan, and Turkey. 
Syrians who ?ed their 
country several years ago, as 
well as those who are ?eeing 
Syria now, are becoming in-
creasingly desperate. 
In Lebanon, Jordan and 
Turkey, many refugees can-
not obtain work permits or 
enroll their children in school. 
As a result, more refugees are 
homeless. Grisgraber said 
that development assistance 
to host countries would help 
alleviate the burden on those 
countries’ infrastructures and 
resources. 
“For Syrians in particular, 
the desire to go home — and 
the fear that it won’t happen 
for a very long time — are 
at the front of everyone’s 
minds,” Grisgraber said in an 
email to The Tartan. There is 
also a distinct fear of not be-
ing safe even in a country of 
asylum, and many Syrians 
have expressed concern about 
the Syrian regime ?nding out 
where they are and targeting 
them even outside of Syria. 
As the crisis becomes more 
and more protracted, the abil-
ity to earn a living and provide 
for their own basic needs is 
clear: “Perhaps that particular 
fear could be called the fear 
of becoming dependent upon 
aid to survive” Grisbrager said 
via email 
Grisgraber added that in-
ternally displaced people in-
side Syria and Iraq can have 
an even more dif?cult time re-
ceiving primary aid. Refugees 
face insurmountable security 
issues that hinder humanitar-
ian groups, which makes it 
impossible for them to enter 
Syria and parts of Iraq. 
International aid agencies’ 
funding is spread thin with 
several other recent con?icts, 
such as those in South Sudan, 
the Central African Republic, 
and Myanmar. 
This strains the money 
and resources available for 
the Syrian refugees, and puts 
severe limits on methods to al-
leviate the crisis.
Grisgraber outlined the 
underlying problem of the 
refugee crisis: humanitar-
ian aid does not develop with 
the ever-changing needs of 
refugees. 
Many refugees enter neigh-
boring countries and receive 
some basic necessities, but 
sustainable, long-term aid is 
dif?cult to provide. 70 percent 
of Syrian refugee children do 
not attend school. 
When lack of basic resourc-
es is paired with the inability 
to ?nd stable work, refugees 
?nd themselves considering 
returning to war-torn Syria 
with the hopes of ?nding bet-
ter opportunities at home. 
Helping refugees become self-
suf?cient is an issue yet to be 
solved.
In the lecture, Grisgraber 
emphasized that the United 
States has the greatest ability 
of any country to provide aid, 
and therefore has an obliga-
tion to lead the effort of refu-
gee support. 
Through the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees, 
the United States recently an-
nounced that it will increase 
the amount of refugees ac-
cepted into the country to 
100,000 people by the year 
2017.
Still, more problems re-
main with resettlement. Gris-
graber explained that the 
United States’ national secu-
rity concerns often take pre-
cedence over the humanitar-
ian responsibility to ease the 
crisis. Fear of extremism has 
resulted in many people being 
denied resettlement due to 
obscure relations to any sort 
of extremist activity. 
Grisgraber cited one ac-
count of a woman who was 
not allowed to resettle in the 
U.S. because she had “aided 
terrorists” after being forced 
at gunpoint to provide water 
to a Syrian rebel. “What hap-
pens in Syria and to Syrians 
affects all of us, albeit in dif-
ferent ways,” Grisgraber ex-
plained. “The relatively recent 
migrant crisis in Europe, and 
the EU’s ability to help people, 
is a perfect example of this. 
As Syria became old news 
and as the focus on provid-
ing aid drifted away, Syrians 
started moving again looking 
for help, and now we have 
an additional humanitarian 
situation to address.” 
Several Carnegie Mellon 
students weighed in on how 
to help address the crisis both 
in Pittsburgh and around the 
world.
Morgan Reed, a ?rst-year 
studying civil engineering, 
took a hands-on approach. 
“I joined FORGE with sort of 
just the thought in mind of 
helping refugees after I heard 
that there were refugees in 
Pittsburgh,” Reed said. “Just 
doing little things, and getting 
involved in organizations that 
are trying to reach out in these 
situations.”
Floreak has volunteered 
with the same Nepali refugee 
family from Bhutan for three 
years as part of FORGE’s effort 
to pair students with refugee 
families to help them resettle 
in the Pittsburgh community.
 “I think that FORGE is a 
really great way because you 
meet with resettled refugees 
on the weekends, you get 
to build a relationship with 
someone who’s really gone 
through something terrible, 
and you get to help them settle 
in the United States,” Floreak 
said.
“I think a really easy way is 
to be informed,” ?rst-year in-
ternational relations and poli-
tics major Philip DeCicco said. 
“The more aware you are, the 
more steps you can take to-
ward changing those things.
Verma discusses India’s growth, future challenges
Refugee crisis addressed by talk
Maegha Singh/Junior Photographer
Daryl Grisgraber, senior advocate for the Middle East at Refugees International, addressed the current refugee crisis in a talk on Wednesday.
have formed a close bond 
that has ?ourished for many 
years. Ambassador Verma 
talked about how the “shared 
values, the bonds between 
our [Indian and American] 
people, our cultures … the 
shared commitment to learn-
ing, innovation, and our dem-
ocratic ideals” are what made 
the connection between the 
two countries a strong one 
with much potential and a 
sturdy grounding for sustain-
ability. The strong bilateral 
relationship between Carn-
egie Mellon and India has 
had a noticeable impact on 
the university community. 
One such example of this is 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
agreement with the Indian 
government. 
The agreement provides 
$2.4 million in fellowships so 
students from India can pur-
sue more advanced studies in 
math, science, and engineer-
ing at Carnegie Mellon. 
Another example is the do-
nation the university recently 
received from Tata Consul-
tancy Services, which gave 
$35 million to build a state-
of-the-art 40,000 square foot 
research facility. Relation-
ships like these make a Carn-
egie Mellon education more 
accessible. India has seen its 
share of hardships; currently 
India has 300 million people 
without access to electricity, 
650 million people that still 
live in villages, and 500 mil-
lion people without ?ushable 
toilets. However, India has 
experienced rapid urbaniza-
tion and shown many other 
signs of progress. 
Ambassador Verma dis-
cussed the growth that he 
expects India to have in the 
coming years; he expects In-
dia to have the most young 
people, the highest number 
of college graduates, and 
the most millionaires of any 
country in the world.

for the ?rst time. 
Through X-ray analysis, 
the researchers noticed a 
bean-shaped structure at the 
left lumbar region, which is 
believed to be a putty kidney, 
or a kidney with a calci?ed 
outlining. The calci?cations 
are thought to be a result of 
renal tuberculosis, which is 
a disease that calci?es tis-
sues and causes the gradual 
emergence of ?brous lesions. 
If the diagnosis is accurate, 
the mummy could be the 
oldest recorded victim of the 
disease.
Named Irtieru, the male 
mummy is estimated to have 
existed for about 2,800 years. 
Researchers believe Irtieru 
may have had connections 
with an elite family, and that 
he died when he was between 
35 and 45 years of age.
The mummy has been kept 
at the National Archaeology 
Museum in Libson. The ?nd-
ings were published in The 
International Journal of Pa-
leopathology.

Scammers claim to have Facebook dislike button 
In early September, Face-
book announced that it is 
working on a new button that 
will allow people to express 
their empathy when respond-
ing to a post. 
In response to this an-
nouncement, posts from 
scammers have emerged on 
users’ newsfeeds, with the 
claim that they can “get [the] 
newly introduced Facebook 
dislike button on your pro-
?le.” Through colors and lo-
gos, the posts were designed 
to look like they were brand-
ed by Facebook.
Researchers from Sophos, 
a software security company, 
have found that clicking on 
those posts led to two differ-
ent scam sites, which then 
prompted users to disclose 
their personal information. 
In addition, interacting with 
these posts could lead to the 
download of malware onto 
users’ machines. The posts 
also require the user to share 
the link with their network of 
friends.
Despite the prevalence of 
the term “dislike,” Mark Zuck-
erberg, CEO of Facebook, has 
made it clear that the com-
pany is avoiding the term in 
reference to their button.

Researchers store solar and wind energy in batteries
Scientists and engineers 
at Harvard University have 
found a way to store electri-
cal energy from intermittent 
sources, including solar and 
wind energy, as rechargeable 
batteries.
 Known as ?ow batteries, 
these batteries utilize water-
dissolved compounds, such 
as carbon and oxygen, which 
are non?ammable and abun-
dant in nature. These com-
pounds are used to pick up 
and release electrons during 
the battery’s operation. The 
research for the batteries was 
an expansion upon previous 
work, where the batteries had 
formally incorporated a toxic 
compound.
Another bene?t of these 
batteries is that large amounts 
of energy for the batteries can 
be stored in liquids inside ex-
ternal tanks. Because of this, 
the ?ow batteries have been 
shown to be safer and more 
cost-effective option than 
other battery systems.
Last Thursday, a paper 
about the new batteries was 
published in the journal Sci-
ence. The researchers expect 
that in the near future, the 
?ow batteries will become 
commercially available.

Study contributes to argument that viruses are alive
In a new update, the In-
ternational Committee on 
the Taxonomy of Viruses has 
de?ned seven orders of virus 
based on the categories of 
shape, size, genetic structure 
and reproductive ability. Since 
the evolutionary relationships 
behind most of the viral fami-
lies remain unclear, research-
ers in the Department of Crop 
Sciences at the University of 
Illinois and Carl R. Woese In-
stitute for Genomic Biology 
decided to analyze the protein 
structures or “folds” that can 
be identi?ed from the genome 
of all viruses and cells. The 
folds allowed the researchers 
to see the rapid changes in the 
genomes of the viruses, while 
maintaining the same three-
dimensional shape of the pro-
tein. Through computational 
methods, the researchers dis-
covered many common pro-
tein folds between cells and vi-
ruses, as well as folds that are 
unique to viruses. Not only do 
these data suggest that viruses 
originated and coexisted with 
ancestors of modern cells, but 
they also suggests that viruses 
gained the ability to infect oth-
er cells. Ultimately, the ?nd-
ings challenge the notion that 
viruses are nonliving.

Lawsuit claims that a macaque holds rights to sel?e
Back in 2011, a macaque 
monkey named Naruto took 
a viral photo of himself after 
taking possession of an unat-
tended camera.
In San Francisco, People 
for Ethical Treatment of Ani-
mals (PETA) has recently ?led 
a lawsuit at the U.S. District 
Court Northern District of 
California, claiming that Na-
ruto holds rights to the pho-
tograph. The lawsuit is part 
of an effort to give nonhuman 
animals ownership of prop-
erty, as well as rights beyond 
the basic necessities of life, 
with the belief that animals 
should be recognized for their 
capacity for personality and 
intelligence. Defendants in 
the case are David John Slat-
er and his company Wildlife 
Personalities Ltd., who PETA 
says claim copyright over 
the image. Blurb Inc. is also 
named as a defendant since 
they published a collection 
of photographs including the 
sel?e in question. According 
to a lawyer from PETA, U.S. 
Copyright laws state that the 
being who took the photo-
graph, rather than the owner 
of the camera, has rights to 
the original work, regardless 
of the species of the author.

Top science book prize won by woman for the ?rst time
For the ?rst time in its 28-
year existence, the Royal So-
ciety Winton prize for Science 
was awarded to a solo female 
writer. The Royal Society Win-
ton prize for Science is Britain’s 
most prestigious science book 
award. 
Former recipients include 
prominent names such as Ste-
phen Hawking, James Gleick, 
and Bill Bryson. This year’s re-
cipient was Gaia Vince, an Eng-
lish journalist and broadcaster. 
She won the £25,000 prize 
during a ceremony in London 
last Thursday.
 A former editor at the 
journal Nature, Vince has 
spent over two years journey-
ing around the world, visiting 
places that have been severely 
impacted by humanity’s heavy 
usage of Earth’s resources. Her 
travels led to the publication 
of her book Adventures in the 
Anthropocene: A Journey to the 
Heart of the Planet We Made. 
Her work was praised for its 
exploration of an under-report-
ed area of science, as well as for 
contributing to the ?eld of pop-
ular science books, which are 
said to be essential in reaching 
out to the public.

SCITECH BRIEFS
Single training interventions found to effectively reduce bias
YUE YIN
Junior Staffwriter
Last Friday, the Human-
Computer Interaction Insti-
tute (HCII) hosted a seminar 
by Carey Morewedge. From 
2007 until 2013, Morewedge 
was an assistant and associate 
professor at Carnegie Mellon 
University in the Department 
of Social and Decision Sci-
ences as well as the Marketing 
group at the Tepper School of 
Business, and is now an asso-
ciate professor of marketing 
at the Questrom School of 
Business at Boston University. 
He spoke about the research 
that he has conducted, along 
with a team of researchers, on 
“debiasing” decisions. Their 
paper, which will be pub-
lished in Policy Insights from 
the Behavioral and Brain Sci-
ences on October 1, discusses 
the effectiveness of a single 
training intervention on 
reducing bias.
Morewedge began by 
explaining the importance of 
studying bias, which can be 
de?ned as the deviation from 
an objective standard. More-
wedge noted that bias affects 
nearly every aspect of daily 
life, including ?elds such as 
business, policy, medicine, 
and law. The large presence 
of bias demonstrates the need 
for debiasing strategies.
The most challenging part 
of debiasing is that people of-
ten make biased decisions un-
intentionally. Humans often 
assume that everything they 
do is based on knowledge 
and experience, and can fail 
to pay attention to statistical 
and logical evidence. Prior 
attempts to use training to 
reduce decision biases have 
been largely unsuccessful, 
which pushed scientists and 
policy makers to focus on the 
use of incentives and choice 
architecture, which uses a 
well-designed series of choic-
es to guide people to make 
less biased decisions. These 
approaches, however, are of-
ten ineffective and expensive, 
and can even back?re when 
used improperly. Instead 
of looking at these options, 
Morewedge and his team 
chose to look further into the 
possible bene?ts of debiasing 
training.
Morewedge’s experiments 
began with the development 
of bias testing methods. The 
team spent over a year tailor-
ing their training video game, 
which was eventually used 
in testing. In the ?nal study, 
each participant was initially 
given a bias pre-test, which 
determined the amount of 
bias present in their decisions 
before the training. Partici-
pants were then given proper 
training through the use of an 
educational game or video. 
After the training, they were 
given several post-tests to 
check their bias levels again. 
These tests were adminis-
tered immediately after the 
training and again after an 
extended period of time.
The research team con-
ducted several styles of inter-
vention to test various types 
of bias. 
In the ?rst experiment, the 
intervention training targeted 
three kinds of biases: bias 
blind spot, con?rmation bias, 
and fundamental attribution 
error. Bias blind spot refers to 
people’s tendency to perceive 
themselves to be less biased 
than their peers. Con?rma-
tion bias occurs when people 
seek out information and 
evidence that supports their 
own beliefs, while neglecting 
information that contradicts 
their beliefs. Fundamental at-
tribution error occurs when 
people explain a situation by 
relying heavily on person-
ality, rather than facts. For

Soylent food substitute raises concerns
ROBERT MACEDO
Special to the Tartan
This week at Pugwash, the 
science, ethics and society dis-
cussion club, we discussed the 
“food” Soylent, a drink that 
may drastically change how 
people consume food.
Soylent is a drink that 
claims to contain all the vita-
mins and nutrients one needs 
to survive. According to its 
creators, this beverage, soon 
to be solid block, can replace 
all of one’s meals, thereby 
signi?cantly boosting the con-
sumer’s ef?ciency by elimi-
nating all unnecessary food 
preparation and spending. 
Furthermore, Soylent may be 
the ultimate vegan food since 
it can be produced without in-
volving animals in any way. In 
a sense, Soylent’s dream is to 
replace farms with the poten-
tially ethically superior and ef-
?cient factories.
Soylent certainly sounds 
good, but how does it taste? 
This was the question on 
Pugwash members’ 
tongues as we pre-
pared to collec-
tively try some 
Soylent at 
the meeting. 
After downing 
a small paper cup 
each, in addition to 
the usual pre-topic piz-
za, the conclusions regard-
ing the taste ranged from the 
lukewarm response of “kinda 
like pancake batter” to the 
ominous “it tastes like prison 
food.”
While Pugwash does oc-
casionally market itself as a 
free-food club, we try to in-
corporate discussions too. 
Our ?rst topic was whether 
or not going full Soylent 
was a healthy choice. Major 
points of dispute included our 
ignorance about what consti-
tutes a healthy meal. We know 
as a species that eating natural 
food works, but do we re-
ally know enough to fully 
engineer the food our-
selves? There may 
be many nuances 
surrounding 
our natural 
meals 
that 
may be missed by eating cher-
ry-picked chemicals. As one 
member pointed out, Soylent 
contains “everything that food 
contains except the food.”
In response to this, some 
members explained how 
switching to Soylent needn’t 
be an all-encompassing deci-
sion. Soylent can be a highly 
effective supplement if we use 
it to replace only our already 
arti?cial meals. The natu-
ral foods we already eat do 
not have to go. Furthermore,

You constantly see loud-
speakers, commonly referred 
to as ‘speakers,’ at parties and 
concerts. They’re in every 
sports stadium, music studio, 
and movie theater. They are 
even found in every ?re truck. 
They are an integral part of 
the world around us, but what 
exactly are they, and how 
do they work? Despite their 
multitude of drastically differ-
ent usages, all loudspeakers 
are fundamentally the same: 
they use mechanical energy 
to propagate surrounding air 
molecules in waves that the 
ear detects as sound. Gener-
ally, this process is always the 
same, yet a single loudspeak-
er is capable of producing a 
plethora of different sounds 
at different frequencies and 
decibels. The ability of a 
speaker to produce all forms 
of sound, including tones that 
range from EDM to classical 
music, stems from its unique 
structure.
Speakers are composed 
of several distinct parts that 
work together to produce 
sound. To start, a loudspeak-
er contains at its center a 
voice coil, which is essentially 
just a coil of wire. Surround-
ing the voice coil is a ring-
shaped magnet. When an 
electric current is transmit-
ted through the speaker, such 
as when it is connected to an 
iPod, the current runs through 
the voice coil and induces a 
magnetic ?eld around the coil. 
This magnetic ?eld then inter-
acts with the magnetic ?eld of 
the magnet, causing the coil 
to oscillate back and forth. 
Attached to this voice coil is 
a cone called the diaphragm, 
which oscillates in synchrony 
with the voice coil. The move-
ment of the diaphragm is 
what propagates molecules 
in the air and produces the 
sound we hear. To 
make sure that the 
voice coil and dia-
phragm are proper-
ly aligned, a small 
ring of ?exible material called 
a spider is placed between the 
diaphragm and the voice coil. 
The spider also works with 
the suspension, an outer ring 
of material that surrounds the 
diaphragm, to ensure the cone 
and coil are aligned properly. 
A dust cap is placed at the cen-
ter of the diaphragm to pro-
tect the coil from the outside 
environment. In summary, 
speakers transmit sound when 
current ?ows through the coil, 
the coil oscillates with the dia-
phragm, and the diaphragm 
moves air molecules to create 
sound.
This process sounds rela-
tively straightforward, but if 
all speakers work this way, 
why does a guitar sound differ-
ent from a violin on a speaker? 
How is a loudspeaker able to 
clearly deliver a unique pitch 
that distinguishes one instru-
ment from another, one art-
ist’s voice from the next? The 
answer has to do with the na-
ture of sound, and how sound 
waves are produced. When a 
sound wave is created, it con-
tains two important features: 
a frequency and an amplitude. 
The frequency 
of a sound wave 
determines how 
high or low the pitch will reg-
ister to our ears; the ampli-
tude measures how loud the 
sound will be. Theoretically, 
a pitch with the same fre-
quency and amplitude should 
sound the same, regardless 
of the instrument or device 
producing the sound. Because 
sound is a propagation of air 
molecules, however, frequen-
cies and amplitudes are never 
perfect. Instead, they contain 
small unintentional hiccups 
and movements that give each 
sound its unique tone. This is 
why a piano and a violin sound 
different, even when playing 
the same exact note. Each in-
strument creates movement 
of air mol-
ecules in 
a unique 
way, 
which 
gives each 
instru-
ment — 
and more 
generally, each and every 
sound — its de?ning quality.
These distinct notes are 
then transmitted through 
speakers, which are able to 
distinguish between these 
slightly varied tones by mim-
icking the imperfect frequen-
cies and amplitudes of the 
sound. 
As noted earlier, a speaker 
requires a connection to an 
electric current from an ex-
ternal source such as an iPod. 
The current from this exter-
nal source is called an audio 
signal, which is simply a rep-
resentation of sound in an 
electric current. Just as sound 
waves can have frequencies, 
so can electric currents, which 
is what allows the electric cur-
rent to transmit the frequency 
of the sound wave to the coil. 
When the audio signal is 
transmitted through the coil, 
the coil oscillates with the 
frequencies that will produce 
the sound represented in the 
electric current. This is what 
allows the speaker to transmit 
sound.
Through this unique struc-
ture, loudspeakers are able 
to produce the sounds that 
we are surrounded by every 
day. So the next time you’re 
on the bus and you plug your 
earphones in, make sure you 
think about everything that 
has to happen in the earbud 
that allows you to hear your 
favorite band.
Loudspeakers transmit sound through unique structure
HOW THINGS WORK
Food substitutes surrounded by health and ethics debate
large swathes of society eat 
substances that we fully un-
derstand are destructive to 
the body, such as McDonald’s. 
Couldn’t a cheap substitute 
like Soylent act as a major 
boost to the health of these 
consumers? It is quite possible 
that, via mass production, 
Soylent could compete with 
even the cheapest meals.
Next, we explored the 
philosophical consequences of 
Soylent. What would it mean 
for society if we abandoned 
the feast? Do we want to live 
in the society where most 
people forgo solid food? Some 
members pointed out that 
food is a major part of many 
people’s identities and lives. 
One member explained how 
Europeans already believe 
Americans are processing the 
culture out of food by treating 
meals as fuel rather than as 
something that adds greater 
value to their lives. This mem-
ber then pointed out that a 
European could potentially 
see Soylent as “processing the 
food out of food.”
Another ethical issue arose 
when we considered the pos-
sibility of parents raising their 
children on pure Soylent diets. 
Parents are free to raise their 
children vegan, so why not 
raise them on Soylent? On the 
other hand, raising one’s child 
on a new, unstudied substance 
is sure to raise concern.
Although everyone agreed 
that we should not force 
people to eat Soylent, the 
opinions on Soylent were far 
from unanimous. While some 
members championed the op-
portunity for a high-nutrient 
and vegan diet, others felt 
unease at our uncertainty re-
garding nutrition and the cold 
world of maximum progress 
that seemed far too present in 
Soylent’s bland, yet ef?cient, 
taste.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational organi-
zation that discusses the impli-
cations of science, technology, 
and medicine on society. This 
article is a summary of last 
week’s discussion on Soylent, 
a processed drink containing 
all the vitamins and nutrients 
humans need to survive.

The team helped launch 
the Sign Book project because 
teachers at Mathru’s School 
for the Deaf lacked proper 
sign language dictionaries 
in local languages. Although 
there are many references 
to teach American Sign Lan-
guage, there are over 300 
sign languages with unique 
grammar and signs, and Sign 
Book helps teachers create a 
video sign language dictionary 
with custom signs of the local 
language.
In a similar fashion, Speak 
Up! was developed to help 
educators teach hearing-
impaired students, especially 
those who are unable to work 
with a speech therapist, to 
vocalize.
The team constructed a se-
ries of games to motivate stu-
dents and give them feedback 
as to the type of sounds they 
were making. Games include 
causing birds to ?y at differ-
ent altitudes or ?sh to swim 
up and down depending on 
the pitch the student makes 
at a certain volume. There 
are ten games in total, and 
the package is designed for 
teachers to easily set up and 
adapt to their curriculum and 
local culture.
“Sign Book and Speak Up! 
were developed in such a way 
to empower teachers and en-
hance their teaching experi-
ence,” M. Bernardine Dias, 
associate research professor 
of robotics and TechBridge-
World founder and director, 
said in a press release. “By 
providing teachers with the 
tools to create their own signs 
and come up with their own 
games, these solutions have 
the potential to be relevant 
for different communities and 
their unique needs. By releas-
ing the software open source, 
our hope is that other educa-
tors will ?nd our tools useful 
and that the open source com-
munity will build on the work 
we started.”
Both Sign Book and Speak 
Up! are available for down-
load under the MIT Open 
Source license, keeping with 
TechBridgeWorld’s vision of 
a future in which technol-
ogy is used to build bridges 
across communities instead of 
exacerbate divides.

example, you may attribute a 
student’s silence in class dur-
ing the semester to his shy 
and introverted personality, 
when in reality, the person 
may simply ?nd the course 
boring.
The second type of inter-
vention training tested three 
other kinds of bias including 
anchoring, representative-
ness, and social projection. 
Anchoring looks at whether 
or not people are in?uenced 
by information that other 
people give. For example, if 
participants are asked to es-
timate the average time peo-
ple spend on Facebook, and 
someone states that he uses 
Facebook 12 hours a week, 
people might be more likely 
to answer with a number 
close to 12. This experiment 
also looked at representative-
ness, which causes problems 
when people overestimate 
a single example’s ability to 
represent a whole. The ?nal 
type of bias, social projec-
tion, estimates how people 
assume others’ emotions, 
thoughts, and values are sim-
ilar to one’s own.
After analysis of the ex-
periments, the researchers 
observed a large difference 
between the pre-test and the 
post-test. Both kinds of inter-
ventions showed debiasing 
immediately after training, 
with the bias of participants 
who played games decreas-
ing 31.94 percent and the 
bias of participants who 
watched videos decreasing 
18.60 percent. This debias-
ing effect also lasted over 
time. Two months later, the 
bias of those that had played 
games was still 23.57 percent 
lower than the pre-test, and 
the bias of those that had 
played games had gone down 
even more, to 19.20 percent. 
These results showed that 
training interventions ap-
pear to be an effective means 
to improve decision making 
ability over both the short-
term and long-term.
Another interesting con-
clusion gained from these re-
sults was that training games 
appeared to outperform 
video training. These results 
suggest that active forms of 
training, such as games, ap-
pear to be more effective 
than passive forms of train-
ing, such as videos, because 
of the personalized feedback 
they provide. Still, both are 
effective.
Overall, the team’s results 
suggested that game and 
video training methods could 
be used effectively alongside 
other debiasing methods to 
achieve improved societal de-
cision making. These results 
could impact a variety of 
?elds, and in general, could 
improve the way we make 
decisions as a society.

— the national conversation about 
racism, church and state, and foreign 
policy in the Middle East.
In August, Carson was asked 
whether the Bible or the Constitu-
tion had a greater place in govern-
ment. He responded that it was “a 
very dif?cult question” and that it 
depended on which section of the 
Bible or of the Constitution. Both 
comments — regarding biblical ver-
sus constitutional importance and 
Muslim presidential candidates — 
caused Carson’s polling numbers to 
soar.
As he seeks the highest of?ce 
in the country, it is important to be 
aware of the way Carson views reli-
gion and public life. Carson has si-
multaneously disavowed a Muslim 
individual’s ability to serve a demo-
cratic nation, and diminished the 
value of the Constitution as supreme 
ruling doctrine of the United States. 
He is quickly altering the way a presi-
dent should in?uence and serve the 
people.
Over the course of American his-
tory, many have come to this country 
for the freedom it offers: freedom 
of the press, free speech, and most 
pertinently, freedom of religion. Re-
stricting who can serve America, and 
arguing that a certain religious text 
has more value — or even the same 
value — as texts protecting and nur-
turing citizens’ freedom, is contrary 
to the foundational principles of the 
nation.
Carson has introduced a radi-
cal and irrational transformation of 
government, and his questioning of 
Muslims’ rights and abilities to run 
a just society exempli?es the Islam-
ophobia that runs rampant in this 
country.
 Citizens must acknowledge and 
call out politicians who make a point 
of dismantling the freedom and uni-
ty that the country represents. The 
fact that Carson’s remarks have had 
an unfortunately positive impact on 
his campaign should not be taken 
lightly. Citizens should take it upon 
themselves to prevent ignorance and 
hatred from holding such a promi-
nent place in public life.
Anti-Planned Parenthood means anti-women’s health
Carson’s Islamophobia shows Republican hypocrisy 
Renewables solve world’s energy crisis; just ask Texas
The Senate rejected a move by 
congressional Republicans to de-
fund reproductive, maternal, and 
child healthcare non-pro?t Planned 
Parenthood on Thursday Sept. 24. 
The move comes on the heels of a 
series of videos that seemed to show 
Planned Parenthood employees talk-
ing about selling organs of aborted 
fetuses for pro?t.
By now we have all heard the 
arguments for and against Planned 
Parenthood. Pro-life activists have 
claimed that Planned Parenthood 
was acting illegally in selling organs. 
Pro-choice activists responded that 
the videos were heavily edited, that 
no federal funding goes to Planned 
Parenthood’s abortion services, and 
that pro-life advocates are simply try-
ing to defund women’s healthcare.
Some Planned Parenthood oppo-
nents, such as Ohio governor John 
Kasich, have stated that government 
money should be funneled into other 
women’s health organizations that 
do not sell stem cells or perform 
abortions. 
But since federal funding does 
not actually go toward Planned Par-
enthood’s abortion services, the 
organization would continue to pro-
vide abortions with little change in 
service. However, the availability of 
other healthcare services — such as 
birth control, STD testing, and can-
cer screenings — would change dras-
tically due to the funding cuts.
These changes are where the 
problem with defunding Planned 
Parenthood arises. The organiza-
tion is designed to provide acces-
sible healthcare. Pulling government 
funding would force Planned Parent-
hood either to charge more for their 
services or to accept fewer clients. 
Decreasing the available services 
means that not everyone who needs 
care would have access. Increasing 
the price is another barrier to access 
that restricts who can receive health 
care. 2.7 million women, adoles-
cents, and men visited Planned Par-
enthood’s over 700 centers across 
the country last year. Many of these 
people were low-income. The slogan 
of Planned Parenthood is “Care. No 
matter what.” Increased prices mean 
care unless you can’t afford it.
Another key factor of accessibil-
ity is public knowledge. Everyone 
knows what Planned Parenthood is. 
Switching funding to “other family 
planning organizations” strips the 
public of that knowledge and makes 
researching affordable health care 
even more dif?cult. This excludes 
women who may need care but aren’t 
aware of the speci?cs of government 
funding. They would then be forced 
to sort through more expensive and 
inconvenient options.
Defunding Planned Parenthood 
would strip access to vital repro-
ductive healthcare from millions of 
women in America. No matter how 
hard “compassionate” conservatives 
try to please the base and provide 
“solutions,” such as funding other 
organizations, they are still joining 
a ?ght against women’s access to 
health care.
Early last Sunday morning, wind 
turbines in Texas were producing 
so much energy with such little de-
mand that electricity prices became 
negative for several hours, reaching 
negative $8.52 per megawatt hour. 
There are a few factors that 
make Texas’s energy infrastructure 
unique, but we still need to acknowl-
edge this event as further proof of 
the effectiveness of renewable en-
ergy sources.
This is not the ?rst instance of 
electricity prices going negative, 
either; nuclear, solar, and hydro-
electric power have been known to 
do so as well. While this presents a 
problem for the energy companies 
who may pay buyers to take electric-
ity, it shows us that — with further 
research into storage techniques and 
restructuring of power grid — these 
renewable resources could be our 
future.
With renewable sources that 
work, we must seriously begin to 
reduce our dependency on energy 
sources that are ?nite and damaging 
to the environment, such as natural 
gas, coal, and oil. Not only does the 
process of mining these resources 
harm the local environment, their 
use is harmful to the atmosphere by 
creating greenhouse gases and pol-
lutants that infect the air we breathe. 
Despite massive drawbacks, these 
“unclean” energy sources still re-
ceive massive governmental subsi-
dies annually.
Renewable energy sources do not 
come with the same warning labels. 
Once a wind turbine is installed, 
it has extremely low operational 
costs and does not pollute the envi-
ronment around it. The only pollu-
tion and price tag associated with 
hydroelectric dams is in the initial 
construction, after which they re-
quire little maintenance and are very 
?exible sources of energy. Though 
nuclear energy is not technically re-
newable, the world has enough ura-
nium to last 80 years. Solar energy is 
equally promising.
Proper funding into the research 
and implementation of renewable 
energy sources could overcome the 
current barrier of a high entry price 
and consequently sustain our future 
and our planet. Texas has disproved 
conservative arguments that renew-
ables will blow up energy prices. 
Renewable energy does not cre-
ate nearly the same environmental 
impact as fossil fuels do, and it un-
doubtedly works.
U.S. soldiers cannot keep ignoring crimes of Afghanistan allies

The word “bystander” is de?ned 
as a person who is standing near but 
not taking part in what is happen-
ing. Synonyms include onlooker, 
spectator, observer, etc.
This is a word that I came across 
many times growing up. Every anti-
bullying presentation that came to 
my school would tell us that if we 
saw someone being bullied, being 
a bystander was just as bad as being 
the bully. 
By simply observing and stay-
ing silent, a bystander is not only 
unhelpful to the victim, but also 
supportive of the bully. A bystander 
supports the victim’s suffering by 
not speaking up against it.
It is shocking to hear that the 
United States military is turning 
a blind eye towards the rampant 
sexual abuse of young boys in Af-
ghanistan. Despite accounts of Af-
ghan men lying on the ?oors of mili-
tary bases with children between 
them, and the knowledge that sex-
ual abuse of young boys is common 
practice among powerful local lead-
ers, American military leaders have 
decided not to intervene. 
They have preferred to stay on 
good terms with the Afghan police 
and militia and focus their com-
bined efforts toward ?ghting the 
Taliban. In other words, they have 
chosen to allow blameless children 
to suffer in the name of “good politi-
cal relations.”
The United States military claims 
that it is trying to help Afghan citi-
zens ?ght the Taliban in the name of 
establishing freedoms for said citi-
zens. However, acting as bystand-
ers to obvious violations of human 
rights — which America claims to 
champion — is counterproductive, 
hypocritical, and immoral.
Many local Afghan military 
commanders take part in a tradi-
tional practice known as “bacha 
bazi,” translated into English as 
“boy play,” according to PBS. Young 
teenage boys, usually from poor 
backgrounds, are bought from their 
families to be trained to dance and 
sing for private parties of wealthy 
Afghan men. 
But the practice can go far beyond 
this; the boys are often emotion-
ally, physically, and sexually abused. 
Many local Afghan commanders 
even own a boy of their own as a 
symbol of power. If the boys try to 
escape, they are tracked down and 
killed.
Granted, the United States has 
been put in a tricky situation. In or-
der to keep the Taliban from rising 
to power in Afghanistan again, the 
military must work with the local 
governments and militias. Stepping 
in to take a direct stand against ba-
cha bazi could alienate those com-
manders who see the practice as a 
display of their power.
In order to appease both sides, 
Pentagon spokesman and Navy Cap-
tain Jeff Davis has said that the Unit-
ed States military ?nds the practice 
“abhorrent,” according to Reuters. 
He claimed that “a military mem-
ber could make reports of human 
rights violations to their chain of 
command,” where the report would 
eventually end up in the Afghan 
government. 
Since the offending command-
ers fall under local Afghan jurisdic-
tion, the thought is that by sending 
reports of human rights violations 
to local governments, the American 
military is taking care of the issue 
while washing their hands of any 
actual responsibility.
Of?cially, bacha bazi is outlawed. 
In fact, the Taliban’s rise to power in 
Afghanistan in the 90s‘ was fueled 
in part by outrage over bacha bazi. 
Under Taliban rule, men suspected 
of partaking in the practice were 
executed. After the Taliban fell from 
power in 2001, bacha bazi remained 
banned.
Despite the law, it is practiced 
regularly as a widely recognized 
societal taboo. Many of the local 
Afghan prosecutors, who have said 
that there will be consequences for 
those who partake in bacha bazi, 
have been seen attending bacha bazi 
parties as guests.
Accordingly, it is unreasonable to 
assume that reporting the violations 
to the Afghan government will help 
to protect these boys. Unfortunately, 
this abuse is part of Afghan cul-
ture, and without outside pressure, 
those in power will not give up this 
practice.
It is up to the United States mili-
tary, then, to take a stand on behalf 
of those who are unable to do so. 
Continuing to do nothing, to merely 
report and observe as innocent chil-
dren are abused, makes them as 
guilty as those who see these young 
lives as objects and property. 
If the United States is truly try-
ing to enable Afghan citizens to es-
tablish a government more humane 
and stable than the Taliban, then the 
American military cannot enable 
human rights violations as serious 
as those committed by the Taliban.
The United States needs to com-
mit to ending bacha bazi, both by 
enforcing preexisting laws and 
implementing further prohibitions. 
It needs to put pressure on local Af-
ghani governments, make sure that 
those who partake in bacha bazi 
face consequences, and appropriate-
ly punish those commanders with 
whom the United States is allied. 
In doing so, they will be creating a 
safer Afghanistan for children who 
have no say in the way that their 
country — or their lives — are run.
It is time for the United States 
military to stop being a bystander. It 
is time to stop enabling obvious vio-
lations of what are supposed to be 
universal human rights.
“It is up to the United States military, 
then, to take a stand on behalf of those 
who are unable to do so. Continuing 
to do nothing, to merely report and 
observe as innocent children are abused, 
makes them as guilty as those who 
see these young lives as objects and 
property.”

Pope Francis is unlikely, powerful voice for new generation 
DJAMENO NTOWE-FANKAM
Junior Staffwriter
There seems to be less space for 
religion in modern life. It is hard for 
a culture that keeps growing and de-
veloping to succumb to the rigidness 
that is often associated with religion.
Christianity, for example, teach-
es certain principles that may have 
been the status quo when the Bible 
was composed, but in this politically 
correct era we exist in, there is little 
room for those teachings in every-
day life. Topics such as abortion and 
same -sex marriage have been taboo 
and highly frowned upon by many 
Christians, but Pope Francis is do-
ing what he can to change the way 
they perceive these topics, as well as 
the way the secular world perceives 
Christianity.
Overall, Pope Francis has been 
using his tenure to promote peace 
between various cultures and beliefs 
and to work for the welfare of those 
in need. For instance, he has dis-
cussed how the egocentric behavior 
of international leaders has placed 
the world in a state of sluggishness 
and disarray.
He also has opened his arms to the 
LGBTQIA community and welcomed 
them to embrace Christianity as who 
they are, rather than changing their 
beliefs to accommodate Christian-
ity. Pope Francis has even stated that 
you do not have to believe in God to 
get into heaven. This is a highly con-
troversial claim in the sense that it 
opens up to the possibility that non-
Christians can be considered moral 
people.
Pope Francis’ teachings have re-
ally resonated with millennials, 
such as myself, who feel as if their 
liberal social beliefs bar them from 
the possibility of being a Christian 
or otherwise exploring their faith. 
With religion slowly becoming more 
?exible, it allows our generation the 
possibility of religious growth and 
the chance for a more balanced 
life. People can also 
strive for success-
ful careers in 
science while 
maintaining 
their belief in 
a greater pur-
pose.
In a weird 
way, it feels 
as if religion 
itself, especially 
Christianity, is be-
coming more secular. 
Recent statements by re-
ligious leaders, such as Pope 
Francis and the Dalai Lama, have 
led me to consider that religion is 
moving into a more secular era. This 
progression is necessary, because if 
religion were to remain stagnant, it 
might be left completely behind.
Pope Francis has done much in 
his time in the Vatican to improve 
the general public image of Christi-
anity and bring it into the modern 
age. Whether you believe that this 
is a good or a bad thing, I feel that 
this is the best time to be alive and 
am really excited to see where our 
society can move from 
here.

Nepal can handle its own democracy, India
SINEAD FOLEY
Junior Staffwriter
It has been almost a week since 
Nepal passed its ?rst federal con-
stitution, and tensions continue to 
escalate. As of Friday morning, 45 
people — half of them police of?cers 
— have died in anti-constitution 
protests. Nepal’s southern neigh-
bor India looms large over the con-
?ict. While the crisis itself is worth 
of attention, it also points to bigger 
questions about the role of regional 
leaders.
The new constitution, which 
was enacted on Sept. 20, has been 
in the works for seven years. Nepal 
has been functioning under an in-
terim constitution since its monar-
chy was abolished in 2007. In less 
than a decade, Nepal has gone from 
being a theocratic Hindu Kingdom 
to a secular federal republic. These 
rapid changes have in?amed ethnic 
tensions.
Nepal is made up of several 
ethnic groups, and these minor-
ity groups experienced years of 
marginalization under the former 
monarchy. The two largest of these 
groups, the Madhesis and the Tha-
rus, comprise 40 percent of Nepal’s 
population, and they live mostly in 
the southern plains region along 
the Indian border. In the last week, 
the south has erupted with protests 
against what many Madhesis view 
as their underrepresentation under 
the new constitution.
Most recently, Madhesis protes-
tors have barricaded the two main 
borders between India and Nepal, 
shutting down vital import routes 
and applying pressure to the gov-
ernment in Kathmandu. The new 
constitution divides the country into 
seven provinces and distributes rep-
resentatives based on both geogra-
phy and population.
Each of the 75 districts in the na-
tion will receive a seat on the Leg-
islative-Parliament, while the rest 
of the regionally elected seats will 
be distributed based on population. 
This is helpful for the rural, moun-
tainous regions of Nepal, where 
population is sparse, but it also leads 
to an under-representation of the 
south, which is much more densely 
populated.
India, as the regional leader of 
Southeast Asia, has had much to say 
about the week’s unrest in Nepal. 
After the constitution was rati?ed by 
the Constitutional Assembly, Indian 
Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam 
Jaishankar rushed to Nepal to re-
quest a delay in its implementation. 
When that failed, the Indian govern-
ment in New Delhi recommended 
seven amendments to the Nepalese 
constitution. These amendments 
sided heavily with the southern pro-
testers and pushed for more popula-
tion-based representation.
India certainly has a vested in-
terest in keeping Nepal stable. The 
two countries share an open border, 
and instability in Nepal would in-
crease smuggling and terrorist traf-
?c across it. Also, the Indian govern-
ment fears that violence in Nepal’s 
south will spill over into the already 
unstable Indian state of Bihar.
While these concerns are le-
gitimate, India is overstepping its 
bounds. A constitution is meant to 
re?ect the voice of a nation’s people, 
not that of its allies or neighbors. 
While support and advice during the 
writing process can be constructive, 
proposing amendments and try-
ing to delay a constitution that was 
rati?ed by a democratically elected 
Constitutional Assembly is patron-
izing. Nepal is a sovereign nation, 
and its government deserves to be 
respected.
The violence in Nepal is certainly 
troubling, and the 45 deaths are a 
tragic loss. However, when viewing 
this crisis, it is important to remem-
ber that state-building is rarely a 
peaceful or linear process. 
Although everyone wishes there 
was a peaceful path to representa-
tional democracy, we have yet to 
?nd one. By aggressively enforcing 
its will, India is sti?ing Nepal’s dem-
ocratic progress and turning it into a 
puppet state.
Rajeshwar Acharya, Nepal’s for-
mer ambassador to China, summed 
it up best when he said: “Domestic 
issues of any country are corrected 
by the political actors and authori-
ties of the same country, and there 
is no need for any other country to 
issue instructions. It doesn’t mean 
that Nepal can’t work independently 
just because it is a small nation. All 
of our friendly nations are requested 
not to interfere into our domestic af-
fairs,” as reported in Republica.
The entire political system of de-
mocracy rests on faith. A nation’s 
people need to have faith that their 
vote matters. When more powerful 
nations step in, they undermine that 
trust — no matter how good their 
intentions.
Immigrants want to learn English, despite claims of U.S. xenophobes
KAYLA LEE
Staffwriter
Assimilation has been a critical 
concept since the beginning of our 
history because the United States is 
a country of immigrants.
One result of this is that there are 
a vast number of households that 
speak a language apart from English. 
Bilingual families will typically speak 
their native language at home and 
English outside of their home, since 
English is the most widely used lan-
guage in the United States.
However, regular exposure to 
other languages remains the norm 
in America. At Carnegie Mellon, stu-
dents are exposed to many languag-
es through diverse groups of friends 
and classmates. For most students, it 
has hardly been a concern that non-
native English speakers are seeking 
to impose their languages on Ameri-
can society.
In many areas, however, many 
people do actually believe this and 
other negative things about that the 
newest generation of immigrants. 
The National Academies of Sci-
ences, Engineering, and Medicine 
published a report last week that it 
claimed “should allay fears that re-
cent immigrants committed crimes 
more frequently than Americans, 
that they were generally in poor 
health and [a] burden [on the] pub-
lic health care system, or that they 
were failing to learn English.”
The report contributes to topi-
cal debates around immigration in 
part by saying that, contrary to the 
disconcertingly popular belief, im-
migrants’ desire to learn English is 
very high. 
It assures that Americans do not 
need to worry about immigrants try-
ing to impose their languages upon 
our English-based society. It also 
claims that each new generation 
of immigrants has been progres-
sively more likely to pursue higher 
education.
This is all great news, but as-
similation is often forced upon im-
migrant families. A majority of im-
migrants come to the United States 
for better opportunities, especially 
for their families. Knowing this, 
generational progress is inevitable 
and should be further encouraged 
by the American government and 
its native citizens. While the Obama 
administration was trying to pass an 
immigration reform bill last year, 
we heard countless stories of immi-
grant families struggling and fearing 
separation by deportation. But it has 
been proven that immigrants work 
hard and encourage younger genera-
tions to do the same.
This report had good intentions, 
but it’s problematic in the fact that 
it more or less exclusively addresses 
the xenophobic concerns that immi-
grants will impose their languages 
on society or otherwise become a 
burden. It demonstrates the com-
mon misconceptions around immi-
grants, rather than working toward 
changing those perceptions.

CMU’s visiting policy makers are all talk, not enough action
SATVIKA NETI
We’ve had a busy week here at 
Carnegie Mellon. Secretary of Educa-
tion Arne Duncan visited last Friday, 
the Indian Ambassador to the United 
States Arun Singh arrived on Satur-
day, and his counterpart, the United 
States Ambassador to India Richard 
Verma, showed up on Wednesday. All 
of their talks had one thing in com-
mon: none mentioned the real prob-
lems of the issues they brought up.
This is a huge problem in policy, 
where high-level policy makers seem 
to be having different conversations 
than the grassroots activists and the 
people on the ground. At Carnegie 
Mellon, this culminated in a week of 
policy makers talking about absolute-
ly none of the problems we actually 
have, and waxing poetic about the 
solutions they’ve found to problems 
we don’t have.
Duncan was on a panel along 
with other education professionals in 
Pittsburgh, including Carnegie Mel-
lon faculty and the superintendent 
of the Pittsburgh Public Schools. One 
thing they kept coming back to in 
their discussions was education tech-
nology, or “ed-tech” — the idea of 
creating apps and programs to help 
students or teachers. 
Though ed-tech obviously has 
much potential, people are so busy 
building these apps that no one is 
testing whether they are actually 
doing what they’re supposed to be 
doing: helping students learn. But 
Duncan and the other panelists kept 
talking about how wonderful it was 
that Carnegie Mellon was partnering 
with different organizations in order 
to continue producing ed-tech, in-
stead of actually researching how ed-
tech should be used most effectively.
A similar thing happened with 
both of the ambassadors that vis-
ited this week. University President 
Subra Suresh started off his opening 
remarks for the Indian Ambassador 
with ?owery language about how 
wonderful Carnegie Mellon is and 
how many doors we could open for 
Indian-Americans and Indian-born 
students. Suresh made this speech on 
the same day that the The New York 
Times released its “Top colleges doing 
the most for low-income students” 
list. We were ranked 154th, which we 
should frankly be ashamed of.
I asked both ambassadors about 
an issue that I’ve discussed in The 
Tartan before: the worrying rise of Is-
lamophobia and Hindu supremacy in 
India, speci?cally after Indian Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi’s appoint-
ment to of?ce. Both ambassadors 
waved me off and gave me very well-
thought-out non-answers.
What I didn’t expect was the out-
right arrogant nature of Indian Am-
bassador Arun Singh. He prefaced his 
answer by saying that normally, he 
prefers to speak only about India-U.S. 
relations. Singh proceeded to tell me 
about India’s relationship with vari-
ous religions, mentioning Islam ex-
actly zero times.
Meanwhile, the United States Am-
bassador Richard Verma simply told 
me that if I looked at Modi’s speech-
es, I would see that he was actually 
an asset to combating Islamophobia 
in India. Neither of the ambassadors 
even touched on the issue that has 
been dividing the country recently: 
the massive protests against the use 
of quotas for lower-caste people ap-
plying to educational institutions and 
government jobs.
I think this erasure of the real is-
sues is especially hard to combat at 
a place like Carnegie Mellon, where 
students are mostly apolitical. If the 
Secretary of Education tells students 
about how great ed-tech is, they’ll be-
lieve him. If the ambassadors say that 
Modi is combating Islamophobia, 
students will believe them. 
I urge anyone curious about these 
problems to do their own research, 
form their own opinions, and come 
up with their own solutions. Because, 
sometimes, politicians and policy 
makers simply don’t know or talk 
about the actual issues.

overtime. Senior keeper Eric 
Bykowsky recorded one for-
mal save in the shutout as the 
defense held Westminster to 
four shots. Senior mid?elder 
William Webb led the team 
with seven shots, but the ef-
forts of both defenses prevent-
ed any scores in the game.
Last Wednesday, the Tar-
tans won 3–1 against Grove 
City. Though Grove City got 
the ?rst score of the game, ju-
nior mid?elder Tristan Lock-
wood tied it up at the 59th 
minute. Junior mid?elder 
Devin Keane got the lead for 
the Tartans at the 69th min-
ute, and Lockwood sealed the 
victory with another goal at 
the 77th minute. Bykowsky 
recorded four saves for the 
game.
The Tartans will next play 
at Allegheny on Tuesday, Sept. 
29.

SARAH GUTEKUNST
Operations Manager
To the uninformed ob-
server (read: me), football is a 
lot to process. I didn’t under-
stand the concept of a “down” 
until the third or fourth time 
someone explained it to me, 
let alone all the other termi-
nology like grounding, hold-
ing, sack, false start, etc. But 
then I started watching The 
League and convinced myself 
that I have what it takes to 
start a fantasy football team 
with a group of strangers 
I found in an online public 
league. I didn’t really under-
stand football as a sport in the 
?rst place, so this has been 
quite the learning experience. 
My entire draft strategy came 
from the internet.
I ended up with a pretty 
solid roster, mostly by chance. 
I prepared for draft day by 
picking out my top four or 
eight picks per position, 
which I chose either based 
on ranking or by who had the 
funniest name, which is how 
I got Nick Toon and two sus-
pended players (LeGarrette 
Blount). I did, however, man-
age to avoid getting players 
with overlapping bye weeks, 
which was the happiest ac-
cident I could have made. I 
then established the order of 
positions to draft, prioritizing 
running backs and quarter-
backs and leaving kickers and 
defense/special teams (D/
ST) for the end. I planned to 
pick up four running backs, 
four wide receivers, two tight 
ends, two quarterbacks, two 
kickers, and two D/ST, be-
cause that’s what the internet 
told me to do. Then I learned 
that, per week, I can start 
two running backs, two wide 
receivers, one tight end, one 
quarterback, one kicker, one 
D/ST, and one “?ex” who 
can be either a running back, 
wide receiver, or tight end.
Each week I would decide 
on who is to start and who is 
to sit out based off of project-
ed scores because I’m an ama-
teur, but so far it’s worked out 
alright. It took me until after 
week two to look into what 
those scores actually mean. 
Leagues have the option to 
customize these, but thank-
fully mine didn’t take too 
many liberties. For passing, 
one point is earned per 25 
yards, four points per touch-
down pass, two points per 
passing conversion, and nega-
tive two points for throwing 
an interception. For rushing 
and receiving, players get one 
point per ten yards, six points 
per touchdown pass, and two 
points per conversion.
The defense earns six 
points every time the oppos-
ing offense screws up and 
they return it for a touch-
down, interceptions and fum-
ble recoveries get two points, 
and then it gets tricky. The 
defense starts with 10 points, 
meaning they’ve allowed zero 
points. But allowing points in 
the game means losing points 
in fantasy, which can go down 
to negative ?ve for more than 
46 points allowed. My league 
also assigns points for rushing 
yards, which works the same 
way as points scored. Week 
one, when my D/ST was 
showing 10 points, I thought 
something wonderful had 
happened, but as assistant 
sports editor Ian Tanaya 
pointed out, that’s a default.
So far my team has been 
consistent, putting up 77 
points in week one against 
Team Eatdagroceries, who 
only managed a mere 30 
points against me. Then, in 
week two, my roster scored 
76 points, but War Eagle just 
had a better team, scoring 105 
points.
In week one I had to play 
two terrible running backs 
while Blount and Bell served 
suspensions, earning me zero 
and two points, respectively. 
Luckily my starting quarter-
back, Russell Wilson threw 
for 251 yards and put up 15 
points, and wide receiver 
Nate Washington received a 
total of 105 yards amounting 
to 10 points. But my two stars 
were really the Jets D/ST and 
kicker Brian McManus. The 
Jets earned me 16 points, 
catching two interceptions, 
recovering four fumbles, and 
sacking the Bears’ quarter-
back three times. McManus 
made two ?eld goals from 
over 50 yards, plus two other 
long-range ?eld goals, and 
one extra point.
During week two, I got 
Blount back in the game 
which I thought would bring 
up my score, but he didn’t put 
up a single point, and neither 
did my other running back. 
The Jets D/ST and McMa-
nus helped me keep my head 
above the water with 13 and 
18 points, respectively. Russell 
Wilson really came through 
for me though. My opponent 
started Carson Palmer who 
was expected to score big, 
but Wilson and Palmer each 
scored 21 points. Thanks to 
Wilson my de?cit was better 
than it could have been.
This week I’m hoping that 
I’ve reached the end of my 
running back purgatory, and 
I’ll ?nally stop with the goose 
eggs. Bell is ?nally back, and 
my ?ngers are crossed that 
Blount will actually start scor-
ing some points.
If Wilson and my other 
consistent players continue 
to play to their ability, and I 
start to get the hang of trades 
and the waiver wire, I feel like 
I could have a playoff caliber 
team.

As soon as the of?cial 
theme song for this year’s 
WWE “Night of Champions” 
kicked off, I knew I was in for 
a wild ride. The show’s cham-
pions and challengers were 
introduced in a rapid-?re 
montage as a chorus of—you 
guessed it—CFO$’s “Night 
of Gold” blared in the back-
ground. On top of that were 
voice-overs, proclaiming that 
what I was about to watch 
was a “night of opportunity,” 
“promise,” and “change.” 
Such a melodramatic high bar 
would be hard to reach, or so 
I thought.
But the intro wasn’t lying 
on two crucial points. First, 
since this was my ?rst time 
ever watching professional 
wrestling, I would in fact “see 
what a wrestler looks like” — 
in all his (and, in one case, 
her) exciting, theatrical glory. 
I would also “learn that re-
spect is earned, not given,” be-
cause the totally absurd world 
of wrestling was about to earn 
my begrudging respect.
The premise of the “Night 
of Champions” was that ev-
eryone’s big, shiny champi-
onship belt was on the line. 
The greats had to defend their 
titles or go home dethroned 
and empty-handed. This was 
an alluring gimmick, though 
I’ll admit that I had no way 
of telling how “great” these 
contenders actually were. 
I’d heard of Sting, because 
he’s older than my father 
and looks like he belongs in 
an 80’s glam metal band. I’d 
heard of John Cena because 
he’s a meme. The others, well, 
most of them were large men 
in tights who were really good 
at tackling other large men in 
tights.
The ?rst match in the 
lineup was for the Intercon-
tinental Championship. Ry-
back was the incumbent, a 
large man in a leotard with 
the catch phrase (“Feed me 
more!”) who matched up ex-
actly with every pro-wrestler 
stereotype ever. His opponent 
was rising star Kevin Owens, 
who looked more like some 
guy you’d see at the gym. Ow-
ens was, incidentally, one of 
the few men not in package-
hugging outerwear. It was an 
interesting twist on the “every 
man” shtick to have Owens 
also play the arrogant, enti-
tled jerk. Owens slammed Ry-
back in the shoulder early on, 
then pinpointed his attacks on 
that “injury” until he won the 
belt and got to be smug about 
it.
Next up was an episode 
in what I understood to be a 
long-standing feud between 
playboy Dolph Ziggler and 
Bulgarian romantic Rusev. 
Everyone knows wrestling 
is fake, but I’d never have 
guessed until this point how 
bad some of the acting would 
be. This ?ght was classic 
soap opera. Ziggler showed 
up with Rusev’s ex-girlfriend 
ironed onto his crotch. Rusev 
stormed in, ready to avenge 
his stolen love and armed 
with an anti-American rant 
for the audience to boo at. He 
was trailed by new girlfriend 
Summer Rae — for moral 
support, I guessed, until she 
ended up deciding the match. 
At a pivotal moment, Summer 
passionately (read: melodra-
matically) ?ung herself into 
the ring. After being kicked 
out, she tossed her high 
heeled shoe at the referee. It 
missed, hit her beloved Ru-
sev, and Ziggler was able to 
pin him. As she sat, shoeless, 
on the sidelines, gaping like 
a red-lipsticked ?sh, I could 
only laugh.
The next match — the Tag 
Team Championship — was 
not as exciting, but just as 
bizarre.
The Dudley Boyz were the 
codependent hunter cous-
ins you never had and never 
wanted.
The New Day reminded 
me of that one guy in Green-
wich Village who really wants 
to give you his EP. They came 
complete with a hashtag 
(#SaveTheTables), name-
dropping (Bill Nye signed 
some petition of theirs?), and 
an actual trumpet; the latter 
was tooted in rhythm to blows 
landed on one of the “Boyz.” 
New Day retained their title 
by disquali?cation, though 
I’m unsure where that dis-
quali?cation came from. All I 
know is that the Dudleys had 
the last word and threw one 
of the Days through a table. 
Apparently, that’s their thing.
I perked up a bit for the 
Divas Championship. The 
single women’s match of the 
night was for a pink butter-
?y belt that would’ve been 
perfect for Wrestler Barbie. It 
pinned Charlotte, a legacy to 
her wrestler daddy, Ric Flair, 
and his throne, against Nikki 
Bella, bad b-word about to 
break the record for longest-
reigning Diva champion ever. 
I was naturally put off, and 
unsurprised, by the women’s 
loose hair, perfect makeup, 
and nearly identical crop-
top/booty-short combos. The 
men did seem to have more 
choice in the tight clothes 
department. This match may 
have been my favorite of the 
night. These girls are un-
doubtedly real athletes, using 
all the same fancy moves as 
the dudes (though with a bit 
more gratuitous bodily con-
tortion). Charlotte injured her 
knee at the start, and Nikki 
took such heavy advantage of 
this that I was actually buy-
ing that Charlotte was in pain. 
But Charlotte persevered, 
besting Nikki in a power ?ip 
that shocked even me. 
Charlotte’s proud father 
joined her in the ring, both 
in happy tears, and again I 
believed it. It was honestly a 
nice moment.
By now I was getting tired 
of the whole spectacle, so I 
won’t go much into the pre-
?nale ?ght between the Wyatt 
Family and Roman Reigns, 
Dean Ambrose, and Chris Jer-
icho. I couldn’t tell you who 
was who, or what happened, 
just that several of them had 
pseudo-horror opening se-
quences with soundbites such 
as “It’s okay to be afraid — I 
am your destruction.”
Finally, it was time for the 
?nale: wrestling’s latest big-
shot Seth Rollins (relatively 
normal-sized, resembles Tar-
zan) forced to defend both 
of his titles. However, Rollins 
needed to be knocked down 
a few pegs. First, he and John 
Cena (think “state college 
football player with a heart of 
gold”) went head-to-head in a 
rematch for the United States 
Championship. They threw 
each other around and laid on 
the ground breathing heavily 
a lot.
It went on for a while, but 
John Cena eventually won, 
which I felt was appropriate 
to his meme-ness.
Rollins was pretty beat 
up, and was generally hav-
ing a bad night, so he tried to 
walk off with his remaining 
belt. But “Good Guy” John 
Cena intercepted. Enter Sting, 
the wrestling legend who 
really seems like he should 
be a member of Kiss. Stone-
faced, Sting said not a word 
as he tossed rag-doll Rollins 
around the ring for so long 
that it started to get boring. 
But lo and behold, Rollins 
staged his comeback, throw-
ing Sting full-force through 
the announcers’ table (pos-
sibly actually injuring him, I 
hear). Sting rallied, but Rol-
lins was soon victorious. You 
go, Tarzan, I thought. Live 
your moment.
And then a punk lepre-
chaun and some dude in a 
Hannibal mask stormed the 
ring with a golden briefcase 
and I got really lost.
The “Night of Champions” 
hasn’t converted me into a 
wrestling fan. Still, anyone 
who watches this carefully 
plotted, violent, ridiculous 
spectacle of a thing cannot 
deny that it’s art and sport. 
It’s also something else on its 
own. Something that I can-
not, for the life of me, name.
WWE show truly something

Sam Benger stays focused on wins despite rushing record
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
He may have broken the 
school record for rushing 
yards in a single game, but 
sophomore running back Sam 
Benger remains focused on the 
next game for the Tartans. The 
business administration major 
from Hingham, Mass who has 
received many personal acco-
lades recently such as being 
named the Carnegie Mellon 
Student-Athlete of the Week 
and Corvias Eastern Confer-
ence Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) South Region Player 
of the Week. Despite all the 
hubbub, he is devoted to doing 
whatever he can to ensure the 
Tartans win as many games as 
possible this season.
Benger has always been 
about the team atmosphere in 
football.
“The camaraderie and 
team atmosphere, really prev-
alent in football, have always 
been something really impor-
tant to me,” Benger said.
“I got started in football as 
soon as I could. My dad was 
always into football, and so 
was I.” 
Though the team atmo-
sphere that he loves has al-
ways been present, Benger ac-
knowledges some differences 
in the way the game ?ows as 
his career progresses. “The 
level of commitment and com-
petition changes as you get 
into varsity or into college.” 
Still, Benger has approached 
the sport in the spirit of fun 
and sportsmanship, working 
hard to win but always re-
membering to enjoy himself. 
“If you’re in the sport for any-
thing besides fun or trying to 
win, you’re doing something 
wrong,” he said.
Benger has done well for 
himself and his teams. In his 
junior year of high school, his 
team made it into the playoffs 
and managed to do well. Se-
nior year had a season of ad-
versity: the starting quarter-
back, a close friend of Benger, 
sustained a leg injury early on. 
“We ended up ?nishing the 
year at .500, but we ended on 
a high note in the Thanksgiv-
ing game against our rival.” 
As a member of the Tar-
tans, Benger has become one 
of the most dynamic running 
backs in collegiate football. He 
currently leads Division III in 
all-purpose yards with 244.3 
yards per game. Many outlets 
noted his 303 yard rushing 
performance against Washing-
ton and Jefferson, but Benger 
himself was quick to credit the 
offensive line for stellar run 
blocking. 
“I need to take those guys 
out to dinner sometime,” he 
said. Despite the attention 
on him for his performance, 
Benger remains devoted to the 
team. “I don’t think personal 
accolades are that impor-
tant. To have the respect and 
friendship of your teammates 
is more important to me.”
Outside of football, Benger 
has continued to keep up with 
the extensive Carnegie Mellon 
coursework. “Academics have 
always been very important 
to me. Our coach says it all the 
time: You come to CMU be-
cause you love the challenges 
and you love the environment 
that pushes you academi-
cally.” In addition, Benger is a 
member of Greek life. 
“I’m joining a fraternity: Al-
pha Sigma Phi. Because it just 
started, there’s an opportunity 
to play a part in determining 
its direction.”
His involvement in sports 
has also helped him improve 
his time management skills: 
“Try to utilize any downtime 
in between classes. It can re-
ally be used to make progress 
as far as studying and home-
work go.”
For Benger, the future re-
mains wide open. “I knew 
CMU was a great school, but I 
didn’t know what I wanted to 
do. I thought business would 
help open as many doors as 
possible.”
Rather than getting bogged 
down by uncertainty, Benger 
instead eagerly explores the 
large variety of avenues he can 
take.
“One thing I’m toying with 
is investment analysis and 
investment banking. There’s 
a lot of knowledgeable guys 
on the team that can help me 
out.”
Carnegie Mellon Volleyball wins 3 of 4 on home court
JORDAN SAFER
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s volleyball team came 
back to campus on Friday 
and Saturday to showcase its 
success in front of the home 
crowd at the Carnegie Mellon 
DoubleTree Invitational. The 
Tartans ?nished 3–1 in the 
round robin with wins against 
Stevenson, Pomona-Pitzer, 
and Mount Union. The lone 
loss—the Tartans’ second of 
the season—was to John Car-
roll in a competitive match 
Friday night.
Strong play and positive 
energy through the two days 
of double headers displayed 
the Tartans’ grit as they 
fought back from lost sets and 
cheered each other on, even 
when playing from behind. 
After the team fell behind 19–
11 in their third set against 
Stevenson, senior captain and 
setter Emily Newton could be 
heard calling out “C’mon Tar-
tans!” to rally her teammates.
Play at the line also proved 
to be a strong point for the 
home team, with junior mid-
dle blocker Jackie Gibbons 
and sophomore middle block-
er Eliza Donahue making key 
blocks and kills. The tourna-
ment is one of only a few held 
at home, Newton noted, “It 
was really great to have [the] 
tournament at home because 
[the team] could have all our 
fans here and [they] could 
really show campus … who 
[they] are as a team”.
Re?ecting on the tourna-
ment play, Newton expressed 
pride in her teams’ effort. 
Twice, the Tartans came back 
from losing consecutive sets 
to dominate in the ?fth set. 
She said, “We have our goals, 
and one of our goals is to al-
ways play to win, so we had 
to refocus on our goal and 
we decided that this is our 
game and we’re taking it from 
them. So it’s all our focus and 
energy.”
The team opened up play 
against Stevenson Friday eve-
ning with a strong showing, 
holding off a late Stevenson 
rally to win in ?ve sets. The 
Tartans got ahead early, con-
trolling the ?rst two sets with 
wins of 25–12 and 25–20. 
However, Stevenson clawed 
their way back, leading the 
way throughout the third set, 
winning 25–19.
The Tartans came back 
swinging in the fourth set, 
with an unassisted kill by Gib-
bons and a kill by Donahue 
assisted by Newton leading 
to a 12–7 lead. The Stevenson 
women rallied and surprised 
the Tartans, sending the game 
to a third set, but the Carn-
egie Mellon women came 
prepared to ?nish. First-year 
outside hitter Lauren Mueller 
opened the set with a kill off a 
Newton assist, and the Tartan 
women pressed to a 9–1 lead. 
From there, the team com-
fortably closed out the 5th set 
with a 15–11 win.
In their only loss of the 
weekend, the Tartans fought 
to compete against John Car-
roll in a match coming imme-
diately on the heels of their 
?ve-set battle with Stevenson. 
After splitting the ?rst two 
sets, the women fell behind 
early in the third, with New-
ton getting shaken up three 
points in. The team fought 
back from a 1–6 hole to tie 
the game at 17. The Tartans 
battled back and forth with 
John Carroll in the 4th set. Up 
23–22, Gibbons drove back 
the John Carroll defense with 
a strike, and Newton quickly 
set up the return for a key 
down the line strike by ?rst-
year outside hitter Sarah Ju-
rgens. Although John Carroll 
prevailed in the last set, the 
Tartans put up a good show-
ing coming into the match 
with little rest.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
began play against Pomona-
Spitzer. Coming off a loss, 
the team rebounded well, 
taking the game in straight 
sets. After holding off a rally 
in the second set, the Tartans 
dominated the third, going up 
8–1 and leading to the ?nish. 
They closed out the game in 
dominant fashion, with a kill 
smashed down the middle 
of the court by Gibbons off a 
Newton assist.
The ?nal test for the team 
came from Mount Union, 
who the Tartans again took 
to ?ve sets before claiming 
victory. The team came out 
strong early with kills by Gib-
bons and Mueller to take the 
lead, and continued with the 
momentum to win the ?rst 
two sets. In a ?erce battle, the 
Tartans struggled to establish 
a lead in the third set, with 
the teams tied at 25. This re-
quired an extended set to de-
termine a winner. The team 
looked to have the win after 
a Jurgens kill gave them the 
lead 30–29, but Mount Union 
fought back and claimed the 
tie-break. After another tight 
loss in the second set, the 
Tartans came out ?ring in the 
?fth set again, reminiscent of 
Fridays ?fth set dominance 
against Stevenson. Gibbons 
opened the set with a kill off 
a Newton assist, and the Tar-
tans rallied to a 10–2 lead, 
capped off by a cross-court, 
arcing kill by Mueller, after 
a great save by junior libero 
Molly Higgins. Another New-
ton assisted Mueller kill got 
Carnegie the win.
The Tartans, now 18–2, 
will continue their season Sat-
urday at the 1st UAA Round 
Robin at New York University.
Women’s soccer continues dominant stretch in big win
ALEX WOOD
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team took the 
?eld on Tuesday night looking 
to defend their undefeated re-
cord against the Baldwin Wal-
lace Yellow Jackets. While the 
Tartan women may have been 
tired for their third game in 
?ve days, they certainly didn’t 
show it as they handily defeat-
ed Baldwin Wallace 4–1.
The Tartans came out with 
an early aggressive push that 
paid dividends in the eighth 
minute when senior mid?eld-
er Louisa Pendergast made 
a smooth goal into the lower 
right corner off a great pass 
through the defense from 
sophomore mid?elder Haili 
Adams. The game lulled for 
a bit after the initial score 
as Baldwin Wallace put up a 
strong ?ght against the Tar-
tan’s pressure. But as the 
game went on, the Tartans 
took control of the ?eld until 
the Yellow Jackets seemed 
unable to force the ball to the 
Carnegie Mellon side. In the 
29th minute, the pressure 
proved to be too much for 
the Yellow Jackets as Tartan 
sophomore forward Sienna 
Stritter was fouled making a 
move in the box. This set the 
Tartans up for a penalty kick, 
and Pendergast rose to the 
occasion once again, sending 
the ball past the Yellow Jacket 
goalkeeper to put Carnegie 
Mellon up 2–0. The Tartans 
rode this momentum through 
the rest of the game, and in 
the 38th minute, the Tartans 
seeimngly began to show off 
when ?rst-year mid?elder 
Tessa Allen leapt over the de-
fense and headed a ball into 
the goal off of a corner kick 
from junior mid?elder Del-
aney Lam. The Tartan’s ?nal 
score of the game came three 
minutes later, when Stritter 
found sophomore mid?elder 
Morgan Kontor for a wide–
open touch into the goal, leav-
ing the score at the half 4–0.
The game moved slowly 
through the second half, al-
though the Tartans did ap-
pear to have a ?rm grip on 
their lead. They kept the ball 
on the Baldwin Wallace side 
of the ?eld, maintaining pres-
sure even though they there 
were no Tartan goals in the 
second half.
While the Tartans did not 
manage to score, they did 
manage to hold the Yellow 
Jackets to only one goal. This 
came in the 77th minute when 
Tartan keeper Sarah Mahler 
couldn’t keep her hands on a 
header delivered from Yellow 
Jacket Kelly Gough. With the 
exception of this late goal, 
the Tartans played sound de-
fense, as junior mid?elder 
Anna Vonderhaar kept the 
ball on the Yellow Jacket’s 
side to allow her team to play 
aggressively.
Ultimately, the Tartans 
showed that they deserve 
their undefeated record with 
a dominating performance. 
They will look to put their 
record to the test with real 
stakes in their conference 
games later in the season.
The Tartan women played 
again Friday night against the 
John Carroll Blue Streaks, 
and they displayed another 
dominating performance to 
continue their undefeated 
record. The Tartans emerged 
victorious with a 5–1 score-
line with goals from Haili Ad-
ams, Sienna Stritter, Nicole 
Winegardner, Louisa Pend-
ergast, and Tessa Allen. They 
managed to outdo John Car-
roll in shots on goal by a mar-
gin of 21–3 showing just how 
dominant they can be. 
On Sunday the Tartans 
beat Capital University 3–2. 
Kontor tied the game in the 
90th minute, and sophomore 
forward Grant Wilmer scored 
the winning goal in overtime.
The Tartans look to contin-
ue running the table as they 
move into October.

Drake and Future drop mixtape
What a Time To Be Alive generates minimal life enthusiasm
On Sunday, September 20, Drake and Future released 
their highly anticipated mixtape entitled What a Time 
To Be Alive. The mixtape consists of 11 songs, nine 
performed by both Drake and Future together and two 
performed by each rapper individually.
Drake is both a rapper and a singer. Drake, the rapper, 
as presented in his songs “The Motto,” “All Me,” and 
“Started From the Bottom,” tends to be like any typical 
rapper that raps about money, women, and haters. 
Contrarily, Drake, the singer, as heard in his song “Hold 
On We’re Going Home,” “Marvin’s Room,” and “Shot 
for Me,” is the Drake everyone likes to make fun of for 
being “soft” and “in his feels” about his exes. If you’re 
expecting to hear Drake singing in this mixtape, don’t 
hold your breath. Maybe it is because he is sharing the 
mic with another rapper or trying to maintain a certain 
post-Meek Mill diss track image, but the singing Drake 
hardly makes an appearance on the mixtape. Future 
also sticks to rapping as opposed to his raspy and very 
throaty vocals.
The mixtape begins with “Digital Dash,” which refers 
to an expensive car with a digital dashboard. This song 
sets the tone for the entire mixtape and lets all listeners 
know that Drake and Future are not here to play around. 
If you think Drake and Future have been everywhere 
you look this past year, you would be correct. Between 
the two of them, seven mixtapes have been released in 
the past year and this song shows listeners that they 
don’t plan on stopping anytime soon. Future begins the 
song with Drake only coming in for one verse at the end. 
This is definitely the song to blast when haters from 
high school are still trying to be relevant in your life, but 
you’re too busy preparing for the internship you’re going 
to score at the TOC.
Following this song is another very hype song that 
features a part of Drake the rapper that I like to call 
screaming Drake. “Big Rings” is an anthem for anyone 
whose friend group has squad goals. Drake begins the 
song by rapping — screaming — about how he has a 
big team and they need some big rings and nice things. 
Both rappers also highlight how this is a great time to 
be alive if you’re a part of their crew. Drake begins the 
song very full of energy, but once the baton is handed off 
to Future, most of the energy is lost. Future’s raspy voice 
and slightly slurred words make it seem like he just 
woke up as opposed to Drake who sounds like he’s had 
a full night’s sleep and a Redbull.
Arguably, one of the best songs on the mixtape is 
“Diamonds Dancing.” This refers to not only a rapper 
wearing a lot of chains, but also being surrounded 
by female dancers. Future sets the tone for the song 
with a message about living the celebrity lifestyle of 
reckless spending. This song probably has the most 
infectious hook ever with the line “Diamonds, diamonds, 
diamonds, diamonds on me dancing.” Drake comes 
in following the hook and seemingly did not get the 
memo that Future left as he launches into a verse about 
wanting to spend time with a girl he cares about. If 
you’re a big fan of singing Drake like I am, this is the 
closest you’ll get to him on this mixtape. Future again 
comes in with a verse about money and jewelry trying 
to remind Drake what this song is supposed to be 
about. Drake then spends the rest of the song singing 
about how hurt he is by one of his exes, giving us a little 
glimpse that the old Drake is still in there somewhere. 
Even though Drake and Future showed up to record two 
completely different songs, the contrasting ideas still 
work together to make a pretty good song.
While singing Drake is still slightly present for 
“Changing Locations,” he seems to have remembered 
why he’s here and returns to singing about how he and 
his friends have money to spend. Future stays true to 
the message of the whole mixtape by rapping about 
money, drugs, and women. By this point in the mixtape, 
it starts to sound like all of the songs are the same 
because they are mostly rapping about the same things 
over and over. However, something about the chorus of 
“Changing Locations” still makes it enjoyable to listen 
to. Following this song is “Jumpman,” in which they 
rap about speculated collaboration between them. This 
song also references the Air Jordan logo by saying that 
they are as recognizable as the “Jumpman.”
The mixtape ends with “Jersey” and “30 for 30 
Freestyle,” solo tracks by Future and Drake, respectively. 
If you can still stand Future’s voice long enough to listen 
to an entire song of his by this point, I applaud you. 
Future’s song is primarily focused on him promoting his 
crew, and it isn’t the worst Future song, but I just wish it 
would’ve appeared sooner in the mixtape so I would’ve 
enjoyed listening to it instead of waiting for it to be over. 
Drake chooses to allude to several different events in his 
life recently throughout his song. It is almost like he uses 
this song to get out all the random Drake thoughts that 
didn’t fit anywhere else in the mixtape.
What a Time To Be Alive shows just how excited Drake 
and Future are to be on top of the game together. 
Whether they are the best rappers out right now is 
definitely up for debate, but it is undeniable that they 
have had a large presence in the hip-hop community 
since they came on the scene. Overall, the mixtape does 
have some really good moments. Is this mixtape fire? 
Definitely not, but it is a nice sweater to keep you warm 
while you’re waiting for Views From the 6 or a J. Cole 
and Kendrick Lamar joint album.

Advice for awkward people
Hey, Josh!
Long story short, I am 
not getting enough sleep. 
I’m tired. Like really tired.
Like sleepwalking 24/7 
tired. Like so tired that I 
pass out standing in line 
for lunch. It got pretty 
bad yesterday when I fell 
asleep standing in line at 
Resnik and crashed onto 
a short guy, and I may 
or may not have broken 
his arm in the process. 
It’s not my fault — I’m a 
sturdy lad. Anyway, it’s 
been a month since the 
semester started, and I 
still haven’t adjusted to 
the schedule. Over the 
summer, I would wake 
up at 6 a.m., go for a run, 
make myself breakfast 
and have a really leisure-
filled day, but nowadays, 
my sleep schedule is all 
messed up. 
The worst part is that I 
don’t even feel like I’m 
being productive. I want 
to sleep, but I need to 
stay up and get things 
done. I want to stay 
up until 4 a.m. to have 
more time in the day. I’ve 
tried coffee and energy 
drinks, and I’ve even 
started sitting criss-cross 
applesauce so that my 
legs fall asleep. My legs 
are so well-rested, and 
the rest of my body is 
jealous. Help, please.
Blandly, 
Tipsy, Irate, Red-Eyed 
Dude
Dear TIRED,
Slow down. Take a breath. 
I think that you need to get 
your priorities in order; you 
need to sleep, but you want 
to stay up and get things 
done. I strongly believe in 
the health benefits of sleep. 
I engage in sleep several 
times a week, maybe even 
every night if I’m feeling 
frisky. If you’re finding that 
there are not enough hours 
in the day, you should plan 
your days better, drop 
some commitments that are 
sucking up your time, and 
work smarter, not harder. 
You should never put your 
health on the backburner— 
especially if doing so causes 
you to crush shorter men. 
That’s just not cool.
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown.

The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust knows how to throw a 
good party, and their formula is simple: free food, free 
wine, and art with a purpose. In the Cultural District 
last Friday, artists and art-lovers communed over local 
and international creative works from the Cultural 
Trust’s Gallery Crawl and India in Focus showcase.
The Crawl was hosted by various galleries and 
nonpro?ts primarily residing on the parallel streets of 
Liberty and Penn Ave. Participants included bars and 
restaurants such as Olive or Twist, on Penn Ave., who 
displayed the work of Art Institute students in their 
second ?oor while serving drinks on the ground ?oor. 
Additionally, many of the Market Square businesses 
such as Gaby et Jules, the French bakery, remained 
open late into the night, serving specialties for hungry 
and thirsty “crawlers.”
The Crawl also served to kick off the India in Focus 
showcase, in which for six weeks, dozens of arts 
experiences paying homage to Indian traditions and 
culture will be displayed throughout the Cultural 
District. The kick off was held primarily at the outdoor 
stage where shows of music and dancing such as 
Bhangra were held continuously throughout the 
evening. Wood Street Gallery and SPACE gallery also 
participated in the kick off by opening new exhibits 
curated speci?cally for the showcase.
Wood Street Gallery served as a pseudo-entrance to the 
Crawl due to its prominent location on the Wood/6th 
St. triangular block. Perched above the Wood Street 
subway station were two ?oors of warmly lit, white-
washed walls where the works of artists Nandini Valli 
Muthiah and Hetain Patel were displayed.
The second ?oor is home to the photographic series 
“Eva,” as well as three standalone video works by artist 
Hetain Patel. The series is broken up into diptychs and 
triptychs, each of a different moment. Hetain’s wife 
is the subject of these photos. She is photographed 
from the back, showing only her head and torso. There 
is a drawing on her otherwise naked back in each of 
the moments. In one series, a man joins her in a silent 
conversation through the writings on both of their 
backs. Each moment is composed of two or three 
images which create a disjointed, schizophrenic feeling 
for the viewer and is particularly consistent with the 
stream of consciousness text displayed on the skin of 
the subject. The videos convey Hetain’s compulsion for 
exactitude as he reconstructs scenes from Crouching 
Tiger, Hidden Dragon and from footage of his father 
giving a tour of his factory.
Nandini Valli Muthiah’s photographic prints from her 
series “De?nitive Incarnate” cover most of the third 
?oor space. The work is supernatural in subject and 
cinematic in method. There is a certain canniness to 
her images  — you may even feel as though you have 
seen the image before. But although the lighting, 
background and positioning of extras feels reminiscent 
of the way many modern ?lms are shot, the subject is 
new. An Indian god named Krishna is presented plainly, 
at the focal point of the image, creating a new reality 
that is both familiar and unusual.
The contemporary gallery, SPACE, presented 
another exhibit called “PLUS ONE” as part of India in 
Focus, which included various mediums including 
installation, sound works, prints, and video. Separated 
only by temporary walls, the works of artists 
Shilpa Gupta, Sumakshi Singh, Surabhi Saraf, and 
Avinash Veeraraghavan manage to live in the space 
harmoniously. Each work contributes to the common 
theme of invoking the tradition of repetition and 
pattern-making in Indian visual culture. It is beautiful 
to see all the different ways in which this motif could 
be expressed. Saraf’s video of deconstructed dance 
and the rhythmic clapping of Gupta’s ?ap board piece 
“24:00:01” both served as interesting compliments to 
the music and dancing seen on the stage just several 
yards from the gallery doors. Saraf’s ”FOLD,” a large 
video installation, stitches together a mosaic of videos 
where a woman folds clothing, from shirts to saris, in a 
methodical and mesmerizing fashion. Singh’s projected 
stop-motion animation on silk with embroidery called 
“Light Threads” shows the birth of a pattern from 
nothing.
The Crawl had even more to offer than the experiential 
art exhibitions. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Arts 
Education Center presented a design exhibition where 
Young Architects and 2015 Design Competition entries 
displayed their visions for the future of architectural 
design in a lively and collaborative space. This location 
also invited guests to draw what design means to 
them amidst the inspiring and innovative work of the 
competitive entries.
Overall, the Cultural Trust’s Gallery Crawl was an 
upbeat scene where locals and visitors could commune 
over local and international artwork and experience the 
Cultural District at its very best.

If you like concerts, then you know that October is hands 
down the best month of the entire academic year. Artists 
fall tours are in full swing, and most major fall tours 
usually hit Pittsburgh sometime between late September 
and early November. Just about every week of this sweet 
and scary month is packed with a couple of great shows, 
from rock and indie to electronic and hip-hop. Here’s 
a few in the next two weeks that will surely provide 
some great experiences to remember with your college 
buddies when you’re old and gray and going to the 
bathroom more than once a night.
Yo La Tengo – Mr. Smalls Theater – Tuesday, 
9/29/15
Hailing from Hoboken, New Jersey, this band celebrated 
its 30th anniversary last year and shows little sign of 
slowing down. Their ?fteenth album, Stuff Like That 
There, was released in August and the band is currently 
on a world tour. Billed as “An Acoustic Evening,” it 
stretches into December. This is a great chance to 
catch an intimate performance at one of Pittsburgh’s 
most celebrated and iconic venues. Tickets are $22 and 
available through ticketweb.com.
TAUK – Rex Theater – Friday, 10/2/15
This four-piece prog-jam rock band delivers some funky 
tunes and tight musicianship. Fans of other jam or blues 
rock bands will de?nitely ?nd a lot to get down to here. 
However, this is a 21+ show. Bummer. Sweet Earth is 
opening and tickets are $12 through showclix.com.
Flux Pavillion – Stage AE – Saturday, 10/3/15
For fans of heavy dubstep coupled with loud and bright 
performances, Flux Pavillion’s Tesla Tour stop at AE is 
going to be the highlight of your semester. This is a bit of 
a disappointment, considering October is usually packed 
with bass (Last October, Skrillex, Bassnectar, the Glitch 
Mob, just to name a few, hit the Burgh). Still, Flux is sure 
to be a high-energy show with more anthemic drops 
than you could shake a Rick and Morty themed totem 
at. Wilkinson and Diskord are opening, and tickets are 
$34.10 through ticketmaster.com.
Norma Jean – Rex Theater – Saturday, 10/3/15
Marilyn Monroe, live and in the (zombi?ed) ?esh, at the 
Rex! No, it’s actually the Atlanta-based metalcore band 
named after the actress’s birth name. They are currently 
touring behind the 10th anniversary of their sophomore 
album, O God, the Aftermath, playing the album in 
its entirety during each stop. Get ready for a moshpit 
spanning many generational gaps. Tickets are $18 
through ticket?y.com.
Michal Menert – Club Café – Sunday, 10/4/15
Any fan of purple haze-tinged electro-soul acts such as 
Pretty Lights, GRiZ, and Gramatik will ?nd a lot to love 
for Michal Menert. The soulful producer is known for his 
energetic performances that often contain some freestyle 
poetic rapping. He is currently touring with a six-piece 
live band. Marcelo Moxy and Wildabeast are opening, 
and tickets are $15 through ticketweb.com.
Built to Spill – Mr. Smalls Theatre – Sunday, 
10/4/15
Built to Spill has been playing live for a long time, and 
the experience certainly shows. The lead singer and 
guitarist Doug Martsch takes turns between shredding 
some winding solos and delivering introspective lyrics 
in his distinctive vocal style. Great for anyone interested 
in Pabst Blue Ribbon and vinyl parties. Helvetia and 
Clarke and the Himselfs are opening, and tickets are $22 
through ticketweb.com.
Beats Antique – Mr. Smalls Theatre – Tuesday, 
10/6/15
If you’re a fan of crazy, out-there, trippy weird stuff, then 
California-based Beats Antique is the band for you. This 
electronic act creates sounds straight out of a middle-
eastern gypsy dub and hip-hop nightmare. Member Zoe 
Jakes bellydances throughout much of the performance, 
abstract masks are worn, and blow-up kitty cyclops are 
unleashed, creating a distinct vibe that you’ll be hard-
pressed to easily ?nd at other shows. I’ve seen these 
guys once before, and I’m so excited another opportunity 
is on its way. Moon Hooch (another fantastic act you 
won’t want to miss) and Pinky D’Ambrosia are opening, 
and tickets are $22 through ticketweb.com.
Adventure Club – Altar Bar – Thursday, 10/8/15
The Montreal-based duo Adventure Club make some 
of the most melodic house-infused dubstep out there, 
and their live performances have begun to earn them 
top slots at summer festivals, so this show is de?nitely 
a Thirsty Thursday option to keep on the calendar. 
This is also a case where it’s just as worth going to 
see the opener as is it is the headliner. Snails, known 
for his incredibly unique brand of bass music dubbed 
“vomitstep,” has been exploding in popularity and will 
surely drop a couple of his high-pro?le collaborations 
with the likes of Diplo and Skrillex in a thrashing 
performance. KAYZO also opens, and tickets are $30 
through ticket?y.com.

Based on the Marvel comic book series, Avengers: Age of Ultron reunites a group of superheroes to defeat Ultron, an arti?cial intelligence with a mission of destroying the human 
race. This movie takes place largely in the ?ctional Eastern European country of Sokovia. It begins with Tony Stark (Iron Man), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Thor,  Bruce Banner 
(The Hulk), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), and Clint Barton as Hawkeye (played by Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, 
and Jeremy Renner respectively) in?ltrating a Hydra outpost to steal Loki’s scepter from Wolfgang von Struckter (Thomas Kretschmann,) a man who was using it to experiment 
on humans. Upon stealing the scepter, Banner and Stark discover an arti?cial intelligence that Stark uses to complete Ultron, a program intended to help and defend people. 
However, Ultron has other plans in mind, as it believes that the only way to save the Earth is to destroy human life. Watch how the Avengers come together to stop Ultron, and 
begin to train a new generation of superheroes in this action packed movie.
