WILL PENMAN
Broke Ph.D. Student
School of?cials announced 
Monday that alumnus Turd 
Ferguson will endow Carnegie 
Mellon with an unprecedent-
ed $900 million donation. 
This closely follows William 
S. Dietrich’s $265 million con-
tribution in September 2011. 
Ferguson’s donation is the 
largest single gift to higher 
education in history, nearly 
doubling Carnegie Mellon’s 
current endowment. The gift 
will be used to fund tuition 
increases.
“We’re very thankful for 
Ferguson,” university Presi-
dent Jared Cohon said in a 
press release. “Without his 
contribution, we would not 
be able to fund an increase in 
student tuition. This donation 
serves to show that Carnegie 
Mellon is a quality institution, 
though. Our sticker price can 
now be adjusted upward to re-
?ect that.”
Cohon noted that after Di-
etrich’s contribution, which 
was the seventh-largest single 
contribution in history, Carn-
egie Mellon was only going 
to raise tuition 4 percent per 
year. “Put up a few plaques, 
give out some mini-blankets 
— done,” Cohon said. “The 
rest of the Dietrich money 
was earmarked for tuition in-
creases.”
Monday’s announcement, 
however, changed the plan 
for the next few years. “When 
we heard the good news, we 
immediately commissioned 
a group to study whether we 
could increase tuition again,” 
Cohon said. “The number 
they’ve returned with is some-
thing we’re pleased to present 
to the student body. The cost 
of attendance at Carnegie 
Mellon will increase 10 per-
cent in fall 2013.”
Cohon’s announcement 
was well received by Cohon 
supporters.
Martha Chastity, former 
head of ?nancial aid, lavished 
praise on the gift. “Things are 
pretty tight around here,” she 
said. “The way some schools 
want better education, that’s 
how much we’ve wanted a 
tuition increase. And now we 
can have it. This gift gives us 
the money to pay for tuition 
increases for the next several 
years. We can reprint our bro-
chures to re?ect a new cost of 
attendance, change the web-
site, retrain our ?nancial ad-
visers. We may even be able 
to hire some new accountants 
to deal with our increased in-
come.”
Chastity announced that 
Carnegie Mellon will restruc-
ture the whole ?nancial aid 
department to reduce

With the national un-
employment rate hovering 
around 8 percent, college 
graduates face an increas-
ingly unfriendly job market 
— none more so than arts 
graduates, who are nearly all 
unemployed.
To stem the ?ow of un-
employed graduates, the 
College of Fine Arts (CFA) 
reached out to the largest 
single employer of its alumni: 
Starbucks. “Starbucks has al-
ways employed a large num-
ber of our alumni, so working 
with them to employ our new 
grads was a logical choice. 
Someone needs to make 
those fancy shapes in cus-
tomers’ lattes, and there’s no 
better preparation than four 
years at CMU,” explained 
CFA Dean Martha Kidder-
man.
Though initially skeptical 
of the deal, Starbucks has 
since wholeheartedly agreed 
to it. “What’s great is that 
none of these kids knows the 
value of a dollar, so we can 
pay them cents on the dol-
lar,” Starbucks CEO John Las-
siter said. “I mean, they’re all 
being given money by their 
parents anyway.”
Lassiter went on to cite 
several other reasons Star-
bucks has long employed 
Carnegie Mellon alumni, 
speci?cally mentioned the 
superior attitude and general 
incompetence the graduates 
display that has long been 
critical to Starbucks’ success.
Senior art major Morgan 
DelRoy was excited for the 
news. “I think it’s great that 
they’re hiring so many new 
grads. My parents said if I 
didn’t get a job they’d cut me 
off, so I’ll just work here until 
I have my big gallery opening. 
Once people see my paintings 
I’ll be set. Then I can keep liv-
ing the bohemian lifestyle I 
deserve,” he explained.
Other students were not 
so excited. “This whole thing 
is insulting to us artists. We 
don’t need money! We don’t 
need jobs! We just need our 
art and our emotion! The 
world is our canvas!” sopho-
more art major Lana Ad-
ams said via email from the 
$3,000 laptop her parents 
bought her.
When addressed with stu-
dent complaints, Kidderman 
replied, “I don’t give two s*** 
what those kids do, so long 
as they keep the alumni do-
nations pouring in. Momma 
needs a new pair of shoes.”

ANGELA VERTUCCI
Left CMU, was too attractive
In a recent proposal to the 
university’s Board of Trustees, 
President Jared Cohon called 
for aggressive policy to in-
crease the Aggregate Physical 
Appeal Score (APAS) of the 
student population. 
Cohon, himself a man of 
demure countenance and ex-
ceptional physicality, is dis-
concerted by Carnegie Mel-
lon’s placement in the bottom 
tier of U.S. News’ 2013 college 
APAS rankings. 
He worries that despite the 
university’s prestigious aca-
demic reputation and status 
as an outstanding research 
institution, its sub-subpar 
APAS score will detract from 
its overall image.
“I expected to be beat by 
all the state schools with their 
Division-I football players, but 
those every school in the Ivy 
Leage got us too,” he said.
APAS scores are calculated 
based on four factors for a 
given population. These fac-
tors include natural beauty, 
hygiene, fashion, and cos-
metic maintenance — serious 
problem areas for the aver-
age Carnegie Mellon student. 
To signi?cantly increase the 
university’s score, Cohon and 
incoming university President 
Subra Suresh will have to con-
trive a multifaceted plan of ac-
tion that addresses each of the 
four areas.
“Look, you’ll never see at-
tractive people sporting ste-
ampunk. And Legend of Zelda 
is ?ne when con?ned to the 
hours of your sad Friday 
night. If it’s on your T-shirt, 
however, it’s a problem. But 
CMU students just don’t care 
about their appearance,” Co-
hon said.
Cohon shared that he 
wants to reallocate funds cur-
rently used to stock the cam-
pus with free news publica-
tions to purchase magazines 
like InStyle, Allure, “and even 
People. ‘If that Gosling kid is 
wearing it, then Jared, you 
should be too.’ That’s what I 
tell myself each morning,” Co-
hon said.
Hygiene and cosmetic 
maintenance present more 
pressing issues. In an initiative 
similar to that which brought 
students First Fridays (on the 
?rst Friday of every month, 
campus food venues offer dif-
ferent specials), the campus 
will begin what Cohon is call-
ing Maintenance Mondays. 
Every Monday, Entropy will 
sell shampoo, body wash, hair 
care products, and deodorant 
at half price. For students in 
the School of Computer Sci-
ence, the products will be 
free.
“The other day I was in 
Gates and a robot got in the el-
evator with me — asked me to 
let him off on the sixth ?oor. 
I thought, how can someone 
have the wherewithal to build 
this bot, but not wear deodor-
ant?’ ” Cohon said.
The most drastic piece of 
Cohon’s proposal to the board 
addresses the most dif?cult 
APAS factor: natural beauty. 
The president called for a 
complete restructuring of the 
admissions process to favor 
attractive applicants and to 
“cut down on all this ugly.” 
He also petitioned the univer-
sity for scholarship funds that 
would be granted to current 
aesthetically displeasing stu-
dents willing to transfer out.
“We have to re-evaluate the 
way that we select students,” 
Cohon explained. “I want 
headshots to be a required 
piece of the application. One 
frontal and at least one side. 
You may have scored a 2400 
on the SAT, but, last I checked, 
SAT doesn’t stand for Sex Ap-
peal Test — so if you’re snag-
gle-toothed, you’re out.”
The president pointed to 
alumni from the School of 
Drama as representative of 
his vision for the future: “That 
tasty cake, Ian Harding — you 
know, the cradle-robbing Eng-
lish teacher on Pretty Little 
Liars — he’s a CMU alumni. 
Ted Danson too. Great hair. 
Athletic build. We need more 
incoming students like them 
to bolster our image.”
As a ?nal part of Cohon’s 
proposal, the School of Drama 
would be expanded (at the ex-
pense of the other schools) to 
allow for greater admittance 
of acting majors. “I may be 
an idealist, but Suresh and I 
know what this school needs,” 
he said. “We can do better 
than this. We can look better 
than this.”
President Cohon calls for more attractive student body

Corrections & Clari?cations
The article “Cohon attacked by gaggle of racist hill-
billies” (News, March 27) incorrectly claims that Presi-
dent Jared Cohon is a woman. He is, in fact, a man. Ad-
ditionally, the gaggle in question request that they be 
identi?ed as “white supremacists;” they ?nd the term 
“racist” offensive.
The events described in the article “Several serenad-
ing sirens seduce science students” (News, March 19) 
did not come to pass. We apologize for the confusion. 
The MCS men featured in the article remain virgins.
The photograph in “Beautiful woman exposes herself 
on campus” (Pillbox, Feb. 1) was heavily pixelated due 
to a printing error. We apologize for the mistake. An un-
censored version is available online.
The women featured in the article “Women in your 
area want you” (News, March 3) do not actually want 
you. We apologize for the ?eeting sense of hope it may 
have inspired.
We are issuing a retraction for the article “Student 
Senate seat of scumbags” (Forum, March 7). The Stu-
dent Senate is ?lled with amazing, dedicated people 
who shine a blazing light of leadership over the entire 
campus. Please don’t cut our budget.
If you would like to submit a correction or clari?-
cation, reconsider what you’re doing with your life. 
If you’re still unsatis?ed, please email The Tartan at 
news@thetartan.org or editor@thetartan.org with your 
inquiry, as well as a list of all the things you’ve done 
wrong with your life that has led to you angrily email-
ing a college newspaper. We will print the correction or 
clari?cation in the next print issue and publish it online 
while wondering what drives one to make such point-
less decisions. We’ll then mourn our own irrelevancy 
over the bottle of scotch kept in the editor-in-chief’s 
desk.

Bicycle Theft
March 23, 2013
University Police were no-
ti?ed that a bicycle was sto-
len from the Merson Court-
yard. Upon arrival, of?cers 
questioned the owner, who 
described the bicycle as a 
“minimalist-looking ?xie with 
retro — but still cutting-edge 
— cruiser handlebars.” The 
bicycle also has a basket on its 
front that contained mustache 
wax, a navy beanie, and a 
pack of Marlboro cigarettes at 
the time of the theft. Of?cers 
are currently scouring CFA for 
the stolen bicycle.
Disorderly Conduct

for a report of a ?rst-year 
student ?ghting with another 
?rst-year. Upon arrival, of-
?cers found that the student 
was having a slight allergic 
reaction to oregano, which he 
had bought from the second 
student. The second student 
admitted that he sold it under 
the guise of marijuana. Both 
students will be cited for dis-
orderly conduct.

Harassment
March 25, 2013
A pair of students tabling 
for a sexual harassment semi-
nar was cited for sexual ha-
rassment. The students were 
hooting and hollering at pass-
er-bys, running up to people 
and pouring water on them, 
and then giving them a poster 
saying “If you’ve ever expe-
rienced sexual harassment, 
come to the Sexual Harass-
ment Seminar.” University Po-
lice say the students thought 
they were being ironic.
Suspicious Person
March 26, 2013
There was a report of a 
suspicious person, allegedly 
a student, closely following a 
university employee walking 
the scotty dogs. The employee 
phoned the University Police 
saying the student had a knife 
and fork in hand and was 
blowing a dog whistle. Upon 
arrival, of?cers found no trace 
of the student save for a crum-
pled-up recipe for stewed dog.
Public Intoxication
March 27, 2013
Of?cers patrolling through 
campus in the early morning 
observed a student sleeping in 
the nude on one of the Walk-

woke the student, who was 
found to be intoxicated and 
who could not remember how 
he had climbed up the sculp-
ture. After the student refused 
to come down and started 
inappropriately touching the 
?gurine, of?cers erected a lad-
der, used a stun gun to disable 
him, and brought him down. 
He was issued two citations.
Campus Crime & Incident Reports

A new Tartan distribu-
tion study reveals that copies 
of The Tartan are primarily 
found in trash cans around 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus. 
This is the conclusion of an 
extensive, year-long inquiry 
into the reading habits of The 
Tartan’s readers.
The Tartan is committed 
to being relevant to its read-
ers, and these results will be 
used to guide future Tartan 
distribution points. “We may 
just start by putting them in 
the trash,” Jennifer Coloma, 
publisher of The Tartan, said.
Others were less focused 
on a interpreting the results 
and more on how surprising 
the results were themselves. 
“You mean people take them 
off the racks?” editor-in-chief 
Josh Smith exclaimed. “Every 
time I walk past the stack of 
untouched copies at the front 
of Baker I shudder and think, 
‘what have we done?’ ”
Matt Hesler, senior busi-
ness major and coordinator 
for the study, explains that 
The Tartan has a special pow-
er to draw people in. “Appar-
ently people are compelled 
to actually pick up a copy of 
The Tartan just to toss it in 
the trash,” he said. “We see 
no evidence that they’ve even 
opened it.”
Trash cans were not the 
only place copies of The Tar-
tan were found. Less popular 
points of distribution were 
bathroom ?oors, papier-mâ-
ché projects, student bon?res, 
and administrators’ of?ces. 
“I read The New York Times    
and I read The Tartan,” direc-
tor of student services Justine 
Hess proudly said. “I think  
it’s important to hear what all 
of the students have to say.”
Tartans Primarily found in trash cans
Dutch give it to Pittsburgh, all day long
Gerald Hans, the Dutch 
Minister for Foreign Af-
fairs, will be paying a visit 
to Pittsburgh on behalf of 
the Danish government. 
The visit is in part the result 
of the sister-city program 
being launched to encour-
age an intimate relation-
ship between Amsterdam 
and Pittsburgh.
“As sister cities it’s im-
portant that we be close, 
very close,” said Allegheny 
County Councilman Louis 
Brodkowsky during his visit 
to Amsterdam as he bent 
before the Queen. “There’s 
so much in a fluid relation-
ship like this to exchange, 
and while we don’t want 
to be accused of being too 
eager to jump into bed with 
each other, I think we’d be 
really hard pressed to not 
take this opportunity to re-
lieve some of the pressure 
we have as a result of to-
day’s economy.”
Hans says that Brod-
kowsky was too kind, hav-
ing “an understanding of 
such affairs on par with 
Clinton’s secretary [sic].” 
The minister also said that 
he’s very excited by the 
softly rolling hills and val-
leys of this exciting region. 
He particularly looks for-
ward to his first opportu-
nity on top of a nice piece 
of topography for a while. 
“Holland is a low, low, low 
country. Being above the 
level of most sea men will 
be a pleasant change, al-
though I’ll miss the smell of 
salt in the air.”

STUDENT SENATE MEETING MINUTES
Constitutional AmendmentSpecial Allocation: Slush Fund
Attempted CoupPublicity Campaign
The Student Senate vot-
ed today to change the size 
of a required Senate quo-
rum to one person: The stu-
dent body president. Under 
the revised constitution, the 
president will have absolute 
power in the Senate and the 
ability to distribute money 
where he sees ?t.
The student body presi-
dent petitioned Student 
Senate for $1,000 toward 
the Presidential Slush 
Funds. The money would 
go toward a “rad party” that 
all of the Senate is invited 
to, ?nancing liquid refresh-
ment and herbal supple-
ments. After two hours of 
discussion, Senate unani-
mously supported the mo-
tion (1–0–0).
Student Senate success-
fully put down an attempt-
ed coup by Guiding Light, 
a student revolutionary 
movement. Guiding Light 
claimed that Senate was an 
unconstitutional encroach-
ment on students’ natural 
rights and needed to be re-
placed by a socialist utopia. 
Rebels were summarily ex-
pelled.
The Student Senate 
voted today to begin a new 
publicity campaign in or-
der to inform students of 
the recent constitutional 
changes. Themes include 
“Studying is Peace. Free 
Time is Slavery. Alcohol is 
Strength.” and “Your Pro-
fessors Are Watching You.”

Gets off on close analyses
Following Carnegie Mel-
lon’s expansion from Pitts-
burgh (CMU-P) to Qatar in 
2008 (CMU-Q) and Rwanda 
last year (CMU-R), the uni-
versity has announced eight 
more campuses.
Campuses in Sweden 
(CMU-S), Turkmenistan 
(CMU-T), Uruguay (CMU-
U), Vanuatu (CMU-V), 
Wilkinsburg (CMU-W), 
Xainza (CMU-X), Yugoslavia 
(CMU-Y), and New Zealand 
(CMU-Z) will open in the fall 
semester.
Carnegie Mellon will now 
have campuses on every in-
habited continent, a first for 
any school. “This expands 
our global academic foot-
print,” President Jared Co-
hon said in a press confer-
ence. “A few years ago when 
we started expanding, we re-
alized that it was much more 
fun to spread than to stick 
to doing what’s best for our 
students. There are native 
people to help and oppres-
sive regimes to contribute to 
all over the world.”
Cohon pointed to the 
troubled history of Turkmen-
istan as an example. “A few 
years ago people would’ve 
thought it was crazy to open 
a campus in Turkmenistan. 
People only know Kazakh-
stan is a country because of 
that Borat movie, and half 
of them think it was made 
up. Turkmenistan takes their 
neighbor to the north and 
raises them one in craziness. 
Until 2006 their leader was 
a man who declared him-
self ‘President for Life’ and 
started broadcasts by pledg-
ing that the broadcaster’s 
tongue would shrivel if he 
slandered the country.”
“Even worse, Turkmeni-
stan commits terrible hu-
man rights violations and 
is one of the 10 most cen-
sored countries in the world. 
That’s a tough sell,” Cohon 
continued, “but after we 
opened a campus in Rwan-
da, where genocidal attacks 
occurred in the last 15 years 
and many consider the cur-
rent leader to be a despot 
— well, Turkmenistan didn’t 
seem like a bad choice. But 
now that we’ve spread into 
the country, we can finally 
straighten them out. We’re 
looking forward to being 
such a positive influence on 
the native people.”
When asked specifically 
about human rights viola-
tions in Turkmenistan, pro-
gram director Bruce Little 
replied by email, “We are 
confident that Carnegie 
Mellon University in Turk-
menistan will prepare stu-
dents to become innovators 
and leaders in the informa-
tion revolution that is trans-
forming Turkmenistan and 
Central Asia.”
The other new campuses 
were chosen with particular 
attention to their natural 
characteristics. “Dave [Turn-
er, Vice Provost] loves Swed-
ish Fish,” Cohon said. “Plus, 
those socialists need to learn 
a thing or two about good 
old-fashioned American 
capitalism! It’s what’s made 
our country great, and theirs 
objectively better.”
CMU-Y, in Yugoslavia, has 
been criticized for not being 
placed in a real country. “We 
did hear that technically 
Yugoslavia has been broken 
up into other countries,” Co-
hon admitted. “But techni-
cal matters are our forte at 
CMU, and we weren’t going 
to let local politics get in the 
way of our ambition. Look, 
we may not know anything 
about the area, but we’re 
sure that we can make a pos-
itive difference.”
Carnegie Mellon will es-
tablish and operate a mas-
ter’s degree program in 
experimental geology in 
Vanuatu. “It’s a small island 
and we’ll be having classes in 
how to detect earthquakes,” 
program director Burt Reyn-
olds said. “We are pleased 
to bring our expertise in 
mounting international pro-
grams and our culture of in-
novation to Vanuatu and to 
contribute to the country’s 
emergence as a regional 
earthquake hub.”
Faculty and students are 
already enrolling in spring 
break Vanuatu courses, on-
site at Vanuatu beaches.
Students who do not get 
accepted to Vanuatu may 
have to fall back to the New 
Zealand campus. “New Zea-
land’s pretty much consid-
ered a developed country, 
so it didn’t seem like there 
was much reason for us to go 
there,” Cohon said. “Then I 
remembered they filmed all 
those Lord of the Rings docu-
mentaries there, and I knew 
we had to go. That Sauron’s 
no joke, and I think Gon-
dor’s going to need some 
good engineers to take them 
out. Can’t rely on Legolas to 
do everything.”
“Hey, if we’re really be-
ing honest here,” continued 
Cohon, “I didn’t even know 
what this Xainza place was. 
But I figured that means it 
can’t be that important, so 
they probably don’t have 
any schools. And I said ‘Jay, 
sounds to me like those peo-
ple need some education,’ I 
says. Wouldn’t you know it, 
I was right. Turns out it’s in 
Tibet. That right there’s the 
perfect level of developing 
country and oppressive dic-
tatorship with lots of money 
we look for when we want to 
expand our footprint. Those 
people need our help, and 
we need their money.”
Most impressive in the 
series of announcements is 
Carnegie Mellon’s daring 
foray into the Pittsburgh 
suburb of Wilkinsburg. “It’s 
a dangerous place, but we 
know that the local people 
need our help. If we can help 
the poor people in Rwanda, 
we can help the poor people 
in Wilkinsburg,” said pro-
gram director Noel Zahler.
The borough of Wilkins-
burg plans on raising taxes 
to fund Carnegie Mellon’s 
expansion. Cohon said, 
“We have decided to accept 
Wilkinsburg’s offer to pay us 
to locate there. We hope that 
this program creates some 
success in the region — oth-
erwise, eventually govern-
ments will stop giving us 
money to establish such pro-
grams.”
“It’s a new model of edu-
cation, research, and devel-
opment,” Cohon added.
Carnegie Mellon has no 
plans to open further cam-
puses after this year. “Then 
again,” Cohon concluded in 
the press conference, “we 
didn’t plan to expand after 
Rwanda either. Maybe we’ll 
find a city that starts with 
Greek letters and be able to 
expand more while still con-
tinuing our naming conven-
tion.”

the money handed out. “We 
only have so much to spare,” 
Chastity said.
Not everyone is pleased 
with the tuition increase, 
however. Future Director of 
Monetary Extraction Eric So-
prano emphasizes that we will 
need many more donations if 
we want to break the nation’s 
top 10 largest endowments, 
led by Harvard University.
“It’s a step in the right di-
rection,” Soprano said. “But 
we should spend this money 
on getting other donations. 
Really wine and dine potential 
donors. Buy a jet to ?y donors 
to visit CMU, with a custom 
tunnel from the airport here, 
?lled with bright pictures of 
our wealth and prosperity. 
That would be a wiser use of 
this money. Tuition increas-
es will come naturally with 
time.”
Administrators were 
unanimous with regard to 
direct changes to students’ 
education. Such expenditures 
would be wasted on students. 
“Here today, gone tomorrow,” 
Chastity explained. “Should 
we really spend money on 
?eeting things like individual 
students?”
“Even if you help them as 
freshmen, they’re just going 
to graduate in four-to-?ve 
years,” she said.
This sentiment was echoed 
by Soprano, who noted that 
direct bene?ts like library sub-
scriptions and ?nancial aid 
were overrated. “Our students 
are so resourceful,” he said. 
“They always ?nd a way to 
succeed. If we spend money to 
help them out now, we won’t 
ever catch up to the Ivies.”
For their part, students 
seem to have been paci?ed 
by more mini-blankets. “Oh 
my gosh, they’re in red now!” 
junior economics major Sasha 
Bernstein said. “If I borrow 
money from my friends maybe 
I can buy a needle and thread 
and sew this one together 
with the one I got for the Di-
etrich donation to make one 
whole blanket!”
Sophomore computer 
science major Hank Kaplan 
was more recalcitrant. When 
asked how he thought the do-
nation would impact his edu-
cation, he murmured, “I’ll get 
it to you tomorrow. I’m almost 
done. I’m almost done.”
Whatever the long-term 
results, Ferguson’s donation is 
sure to usher in a new era at 
Carnegie Mellon.
TUITION, from A1University claims it needs more money
Student has sexual intercourse and lives
WILLIAM PARK
Is a size 13
One reason students are 
attracted to Carnegie Mel-
lon can be highlighted by the 
popular phrase — “Sex kills. 
Come to CMU and live for-
ever.”
Campus tour guides might 
need to reconsider using this 
slogan.
On March 22, sophomore 
mechanical engineering ma-
jor Steve Kauffman engaged 
in sexual intercourse with 
May Peterson, a sophomore 
psychology major. Both have 
lived to tell the tale.
Though fornication is often 
thought of as two people giv-
ing in to their bodily tempta-
tions, theirs was not the case. 
Rather, sex was the product of 
their intellectual curiosities. 
For Kauffman, coitus present-
ed an opportunity to further 
explore his knowledge of ?uid 
mechanics, while Peterson 
wished to test Freud’s psycho-
sexual theory.
So when Peterson knocked 
on Kauffman’s Fairfax apart-
ment explaining her wishes, 
he was “more than game.” “It 
really solidi?ed my classroom 
knowledge and helped me ace 
my midterm,” Kauffman said.
On the other hand, Pe-
terson has seemed more am-
bivalent. “I couldn’t really feel 
anything — emotionally and 
physically. Maybe what they 
say about shoe size is true.”   
Kauffman reportedly wears a 
size seven.
As with any historic event, 
there are skeptics and critics. 
Close friends of Kauffman 
have claimed that though he is 
very much alive, his personali-
ty has completely altered since 
the night he lost his virginity.
“He can’t stop singing Ce-
line Dion and has written 
dozens of love poems that he 
stacks on his desk,” said soph-
omore Chris Swiger, Kauff-
man’s best friend and room-
mate. Some students even 
claimed to have seen someone 
looking like Kauffman mum-
bling to himself outside Peter-
son’s apartment.
Many students are curious 
to see the fates of these two 
students. Should Kauffman 
return to his normal self, more 
students might be interested 
in making time in their busy 
schedules for sex.
“I’m de?nitely interested 
[in sex]. I just didn’t believe it 
was possible to survive,” said 
junior Harry Silbert. “I mean, 
I pass out every time I mastur-
bate.... That’s not normal?”
University of?cials have 
yet to release any statement 
regarding student sex. Many 
professors, however, have is-
sued more homework and 
quizzes in the past weeks. One 
can only wonder if this is a 
ploy by the university to over-
work students so that they 
don’t even have time to think 
about sex.
When asked to comment, 
professor of computer science 
Norman Schmidt said, “Don’t 
you know you have a midterm 
tomorrow?”

In an unprecedented 
move, Dean of Dietrich Col-
lege Mary Porter of?cially af-
?liated the college with Huf-
?epuff House.
“Given the historical simi-
larities of our institutions, 
it only made sense,” Porter 
said in the announcement on 
Thursday.
Porter pointed to both 
institutions’ reputations as 
“catch-all” choices.
“At Hogwarts, if you’re 
brave you go to Gryf?ndor; if 
you’re smart you go to Raven-
claw; if you’re evil you go to 
Slytherin; and if you’re none 
of those things, well, Huf-
?epuff will take you anyway,” 
Porter said. “Here at Carnegie 
Mellon, if you’re good with 
computers you go to SCS, if 
you’re good at acting you go 
to the School of Drama, and 
if you’re evil you go to Tepper. 
And if you don’t know what 
you’re good at, then Dietrich 
is here for you.”
Porter said that other 
Carnegie Mellon colleges 
could bene?t from House af-
?liations as well.
“You have to be pretty 
brave to go into CFA consid-
ering today’s economy, so 
Gryf?ndor would be a great 
partner for the college. And 
God knows the CIT students 
are smart enough and self-
contained enough to be 
Ravenclaws,” Porter said.
Some Dietrich students, 
however, say that the af-
?liation with Huf?epuff is ill 
suited.
“It’s nonsense,” said senior 
undeclared Dietrich student 
Ronald Nielsen. “We couldn’t 
be less like Huf?epuff. The 
Sorting Hat thinks you might 
belong in Huf?epuff if you’re 
just and loyal, patient and 
true, and unafraid of toil.”
“I’m sure there are a lot 
of just and loyal people in 
Dietrich,” Nielsen continued. 
“And I’d be willing to bet 
there a lot of true ones, too. 
But every Dietrich student 
I’ve ever met has been very 
afraid of toil.”
The Head of Huf?epuff 
House could not be reached 
for comment.

House leaders met today 
in Washington, D.C. in an 
emergency session to discuss 
an unusual issue in this post-
election season: the sex lives 
of Carnegie Mellon students. 
Or, rather, the lack thereof.
Republicans have long 
campaigned for abstinence-
only sex education, but never 
imagined it would be as effec-
tive as it has been at Carnegie 
Mellon. “No one could have 
dreamed so few people would 
be having sex. I mean, techni-
cally this is what we wanted, 
but it’s just kind of sad,” House 
Majority Leader Eric Cantor 
explained.
Democrats were critical 
of the session. “What do you 
expect when you tell people 
not to do it?” House Minority 
Leader Nancy Pelosi said. “Ei-
ther people keep having sex 
and pop out babies, or they ac-
tually take it to heart, and you 
have a bunch of depressed, 
sexually repressed 20-year-
olds walking around making 
those of us getting laid feel 
uncomfortable.”
This emergency session 
was met with a substantial 
agreement on both sides of 
the aisle. It seems that the one 
thing Republicans and Demo-
crats can agree on is that the 
sex lives of Carnegie Mellon 
students is pretty sad.
However, this was news 
to University Health Services 
head Rhonda Perlman. “Ab-
stinence campaign? What 
abstinence campaign? We do 
everything in our power to get 
students laid. That’s why we 
hand out free condoms and 
spike the water fountains with 
vodka. Nothing seems to be 
working.”
The Federal government 
thought they could do a better 
job. The session resulted in an 
emergency appropriations bill 
for $10 million in alcohol and 
brown paper bags to be sent to 
Pittsburgh before the start of 
Carnival.
“We can only pray they get 
there in time,” Cantor said.

After five days of search-
and-rescue efforts, missing 
first-year Alex Reiser was 
found hungry and severely 
dehydrated on the Gates 
Hillman Complex helix. 
Rescuers believe the me-
chanical engineering major 
had spent those five days 
lost and disoriented after 
mistakenly walking onto the 
helix ramp.
Reiser was reported 
missing on Thursday by his 
roommate Justin Daniels, 
first-year chemical engi-
neering major. “He had a 
15-110 lecture Wednesday 
morning in Gates, so when 
he wasn’t back by Thursday 
night, I just felt something 
was wrong,” Daniels said.
Reiser had inadvertently 
proceeded up the helix after 
the lecture, instead of tak-
ing the stairs. “While up-
perclassmen are well aware 
of the dangers present in 
travelling on the helix, first-
years and new students 
are uninformed,” said Tim 
Green, a University Police 
officer.
After rehabilitation, Rei-
ser recounted his time on 
the helix. “The first day was 
spent constantly climbing 
the helix. I just kept think-
ing that, any minute now, 
I’ll reach the top.”
Reiser spent the morning 
of the second day calling out 
for help, but his efforts were 
in vain. “The frustration of 
seeing people rushing to 
classes on the other side of 
the glass walls, but not be-
ing able to get their atten-
tion, almost broke me,” Rei-
ser said.
Reiser later collapsed 
from exhaustion, and awoke 
when found by campus po-
lice one-third of the way up 
the helix. There were deep 
gashes up Reiser’s left leg, 
presumably inflicted by a 
roving pack of feral dogs.
While the campus is 
thrilled by the news of his 
rescue, Green sees this 
whole ordeal as an oppor-
tunity to reform how the 
campus community views 
the Gates Hillman Complex 
helix. “We need to better in-
form students and faculty to 
avoid the helix unless they 
are well equipped and have 
extensive survival training.”
Reiser, however, will not 
let this experience daunt 
him. “The helix beat me this 
time, but I want to face it 
again, on my own terms,” he 
said. “I’m going to work my 
way up from easier slopes, 
hire a sherpa, and bring oxy-
gen. I’ll not be beaten by Mr. 
Gates!”

Batmanologist
Carnegie Mellon an-
nounced Friday that Batman 
will give the commencement 
address at this year’s gradua-
tion ceremony.
“I’ve always had a strong 
connection to Pittsburgh,” 
Batman said via text message. 
“I’ve cleared out my schedule 
for graduation day and I’m 
happy to announce that I will 
address the student body.”
President Jared Cohon 
was very eager to make the 
announcement, stating that 
“[Batman] is the speaker CMU 
deserves, although maybe not 
the one it needs right now. 
We may boo him for it, but 
he can take it. Because he’s 
not a speaker, he’s a talkative 
guardian, a well-watched lec-
turer, the Dark Orator.”
Batman is expected to 
speak about overcoming 
adversity, following your 
dreams, and using your 
wealth to invest heavily in 
innovative technologies. “I 
would not be here today if 
I didn’t have a Batmobile,” 
he said, hinting at his com-
mencement address. “What’s 
your ‘Batmobile’? Your com-
puter? Your clothes? Your ré-
sumé? Once you make your 
Batmobile, they’ll never be 
able to take it away from you.”
Batman also intends to talk 
about the importance of lat-
eral thinking. “One example 
of the value of lateral think-
ing is the time the Riddler 
gave me a ?endish riddle on 
a piece of paper. I knew ‘pa-
per’ begins with ‘p,’ just like 
‘penguin,’ and the Penguin 
carries an umbrella, which 
you use when it rains, which 
begins with ‘r.’ ‘R’ and ‘p’ are 
two letters, and they are two 
letters apart in the alphabet. 
Two times two is four, which 
led me to the Riddler’s hide-
out in an apartment on Fourth 
Avenue.”
Another important theme 
will be trusting in science and 
rational thinking. “You need 
to think clearly,” Batman ex-
plained, “unlike criminals. 
Criminals are a supersti-
tious, cowardly lot. They plan 
and plot but they always get 
caught. Their evil schemes all 
come to naught.”
Batman receives many 
requests to speak at gradua-
tions across the country, but 
all of them signal to him with 
a strong beam of light in the 
sky. This has become burden-
some to Batman. “All of the 
lights! Cop lights, ?ashlights, 
spotlights, strobe lights, 
streetlights... all of the lights!” 
he said. “Just text me.”
Texting has become Bat-
man’s communication medi-
um of choice since he realized 
that people rarely understand 
his gravelly voice. The text 
of Batman’s speech will be 
simultaneously projected in 
English, Chinese, Korean, and 
Hindi during graduation.
Batman was nominated 
to be the speaker by an over-
whelming number of stu-
dents. Second place, the 
trollface meme, may have re-
ceived fewer votes because of 
an uncertainty in the serious-
ness of the speaker’s willing-
ness to attend.
Senior vocal performance 
major Melanie Brown was 
surprised that Carnegie Mel-
lon actually asked Batman 
to speak. “I remember a few 
years ago we were asked 
to vote on what the mascot 
would be, and though the 
winner was Optimus Prime, 
the administration instead 
chose a scotty dog,” she said. 
“I’m just glad they didn’t 
chose someone equally lame 
to speak, like Aquaman.”
Batman has been to Pitts-
burgh several times to spread 
awareness of his crime-?ght-
ing campaign. “I’ve also en-
joyed Pamela’s,” Batman said. 
“Now there is a good break-
fast. Not as good as justice, 
though, old chum.”
Carnegie Mellon is com-
pensating Batman for his 
considerable travel expenses 
from his home in Gotham 
City to Pittsburgh. But school 
of?cials consider the cost to 
be negligible compared to 
the anticipation of Batman’s 
speech. After all, as Batman 
texted, “I’m Batman.”
Batman selected to speak at 2013 commencement
“I just kept 
thinking that, 
any minute 
now, I’ll reach 
the top.”

Yeah I wrote this one too
The Kappa Alpha Theta 
house was the scene of trag-
edy today, when the sorority’s 
shoddily constructed Carnival 
booth collapsed, injuring six 
girls. The campus response 
was a resounding “meh.”
The collapse occurred af-
ter sophomore vocal perfor-
mance major Tracy Hender-
son attempted to add “more 
?air” to the eastern side of 
the booth. Already leaning at 
a dangerous 22-degree angle, 
the ?air she added was too 
much for the booth, causing 
the collapse.
“Frankly, I’m not surprised 
it happened. I’m surprised it 
lasted as long as it did,” said 
junior civil engineering ma-
jor Kurt Laurie. “They should 
have focused more on mak-
ing sure the booth had some 
structural integrity, maybe by 
recruiting more CivE girls to 
work on it.”
Students walking on the 
Greek quad at the time kept 
walking. Sophomore Kap-
pa Kappa Gamma member 
Christie Linklater said, “We’ve 
had a betting pool going for a 
while now about when their 
booth would collapse. I’m set 
to win 100 bucks!”
Despite others’ apathy and 
excitement, Theta responded 
to the collapse with the ap-
propriate decorum. As the 
dust settled, members raced 
to whip out their phones and 
post consoling words on the 
injured women’s Facebook 
pages. Junior Heather Kim 
currently has the greatest 
character-to-like ratio with 
her post “:(” on Henderson’s 
wall getting 237 likes. First-
year Kasey Angles is a far sec-
ond, with her post “Oh no!” 
sitting at 312 likes.
First responders believe 
that, had the girls acted to 
save their friends, many of 
them would have avoided 
major injuries. Still, members 
maintain that a hospital stay 
is nothing compared to good 
vibes and Facebook attention.
In wake of the incident, 
the administration plans on 
continuing with business as 
usual. “There is no need to 
alter a grand Carnegie Mel-
lon condition just because a 
few people sustained minor 
injuries, and a few more are 
hospitalized,” said Student 
Activities Coordinator Duke 
Laughlin. “This ?ts very nicely 
with our master plan to force 
Greek life out of the school.”
Theta plans to regroup 
and rebuild, dedicating its 
new booth to their fallen com-
rades. “This will get us a med-
al for sure!” Kim said.

Running out of titles
Rampant bros have been 
an increasingly dangerous 
threat to the Carnegie Mellon 
community in recent years, lit-
tering the streets with empty 
Natty cans and hogging the 
machines in the weight room. 
The Pittsburgh Bureau of Ani-
mal Care & Control hopes to 
rectify this problem with its 
new bro-catching program.
Bros were not always a 
problem on campus; they 
use to stick to their native 
Pitt and Oakland neighbor-
hoods. However, they have 
been spreading at an increas-
ing rate, infesting several cel-
ebrated Carnegie Mellon fra-
ternities. The infestation has 
even spread into Beeler Street.
This spread spurred count-
less calls to Animal Control, 
prompting them to institute 
the new program. “We aim to 
serve the needs of the com-
munity,” explained Animal 
Control spokesman Chad 
Jones, “and what the com-
munity needs right now is this 
bro problem taken care of.”
The program has been 
adapted from previous suc-
cessful dog-catching pro-
grams. When Animal Control 
receives enough complaints 
from a neighborhood, it will 
send a bro-catcher out the 
investigate. The catcher will 
then set up several bro-lures, 
usually consisting of a beer 
pong table or some Red Bull 
cases. “The bros ?nd these ir-
resistible,” Jones explained. 
“Once their attention is on the 
game or chugging Red Bulls, 
it’s easy enough to bag ‘em 
and tag ‘em.”
After being wrangled by a 
bro-catcher, the bros are taken 
to a newly built pound. Once 
there, the bros can be adopted 
into a loving fraternity, which 
will hopefully reform them 
and integrate them into nor-
mal society. 
“We believe reformation 
will be a great success,” Jones 
said. “I myself am an exam-
ple of a reformed bro. You 
wouldn’t even know I was one 
were it not for my ?rst name, 
‘Chad.’ ”
The pound features all the 
amenities bros ?nd necessary 
to survive, including a daily 
Natural Light ration, pong 
tables, and an Xbox featur-
ing Call of Duty and Madden. 
In this way, Animal Control 
hopes to keep them safe until 
they are adopted or, should 
the pound be too full, put 
down. “Sadly, we are not a 
no-kill shelter,” Jones said. “If 
we’re too full, or if some bros 
are just unadoptable, we have 
to put them down. It’s tragic, 
but better for the community 
as a whole.”
Members of the commu-
nity were ecstatic about the 
program. “My street is crawl-
ing with bros. They’re always 
digging through my trash and 
trying to convince me to shot-
gun beer,” said Beeler resident 
Alan Folds. “I’m going to put 
the hotline on speed dial. The 
next time I see so much as a 
pong ball rolling down the 
street, I’ll call. This menace 
must be stopped!”
Bros, however, were not 
so enthusiastic about the pro-
gram. “This is, like, another 
way The Man is trying to keep 
us down, you feel me? We 
have a perfectly acceptable 
lifestyle, but they’re trying 
to outlaw us,” said noted bro 
Lance Chester?eld. “What’s 
wrong with wanting to party? 
With playing pong and pound-
ing Natty? Y’all just jealous of 
my ?y popped collar.”
Should you see any bros 
in your neighborhood, the 
dedicated bro hotline can be 
reached at 412-FREE-NATTY 
(Animal Control hopes some 
bros will accidentally report 
themselves). Operators are 
standing by.

Mediocre CS Major
Today, the infamous com-
puter science class 15-410 
Operating System Design and 
Implementation revealed 
it was not a real class at all, 
but is instead a performance 
art project designed to dem-
onstrate the futility of hard 
work.
The class, which tasks stu-
dents with creating a Linux 
kernel over the course of one 
semester, is notorious around 
campus for the long work 
hours, low grades, and emo-
tional strain it places on its 
students — as was intended 
by professor David Eckhardt, 
or as he is actually known, 
Swedish artist Börje Åström.
Åström is a professor in 
the College of Fine Arts, but 
through close cooperation 
with the School of Computer 
Science, he was able to pass 
himself off as a computer 
science professor. “It was ac-
tually quite simple. I merely 
had to doff my customary be-
ret and thick-rimmed glasses, 
and the transformation was 
complete,” he explained. 
“All I had to do was mumble 
some stuff about pages and 
threads, and the students 
would nod in agreement. It’s 
not like they knew anything 
either.”
Students’ reactions were 
widespread. “I can’t believe 
this,” said computer science 
junior Jeremy Odenkirk. 
“You mean all those hours 
of hard work — for nothing? 
All those skills I learned were 
meaningless? But I thought 
they would all apply directly 
to a job! So much wasted 
time! I missed my grand-
mother’s funeral!”
Computer science senior 
Bobby Deserati was relieved. 
“I’m just glad to know that it 
was all meaningless. Now I 
don’t feel like such an idiot 
for never getting P3 working. 
I am smart. This was just de-
signed to make me fail. I hope 
251 is an art project too.”
In CFA, Åström’s work was 
rapturously received. “It’s 
just such a groundbreaking 
piece. He actually got people 
to work themselves to death 
with no hope of success. It’s 
astounding how long people 
will keep banging their heads 
against the wall because they 
think there’s a reason for it,” 
sophomore art major John 
Hatcher explained, whose 
last performance art piece 
involved drinking his own 
urine.
Still, in light of the contro-
versy surrounding the piece, 
the art department agreed to 
create ethical guidelines for 
future performance art piec-
es, limiting student suffering 
to “Milgram-esque levels.”
Åström will be giving a 
lecture Sunday at 7 p.m. in 
Kresge Theatre, where he will 
relate some of his experienc-
es on the project. Of special 
interest is his section on those 
that managed to actually suc-
ceed in OS, to which Åström 
could only respond, “They 
should have spent their time 
trying to get laid.”

Uptight Copy Editor
Cedar Pooke, head of 
Carnegie Mellon’s School of 
Drama, released a statement 
last Wednesday that sent 
tremors through the entire de-
partment: The school will be 
giving preference to straight 
male students for the upcom-
ing fall 2012 semester.
“This is not a purely ex-
ecutive decision on my part,” 
Pooke said apologetically “It’s 
part of a larger university-
wide effort to increase diver-
sity and improve our college 
rankings to show up those Ivy 
Leaguers.”
Carnegie Mellon will be 
the second American drama 
school to implement such an 
admittance policy, the ?rst 
being Yale’s School of Drama. 
President Jared Cohon ex-
plained, “When we learned an 
Ivy League school was doing 
it, we had to do it too.”
One straight male student, 
who requested not to be iden-
ti?ed, is looking forward to 
the implementation of the 
new admittance policy.
“Now they’ll see that we’re 
just as good as they are,” the 
student said. “I’ve only been 
able to come out as straight 
to my best drama friends. 
There’s a stigma about it here, 
and I just feel self-conscious 
with everyone looking at me 
like I have a disease. It’s much 
easier to just gush about one 
of Angel’s monologues from 
Rent. But you know what? I 
just want to be de Niro. I can’t 
stand musicals.”
Most of the School of 
Drama’s faculty, however, 
seemed rather nonplussed 
about admitting more straight 
men, and a signi?cant faction 
deemed the move harmful to 
the program.
“I don’t mean to be of-
fensive — I have a straight 
friend — but gay men are 
much better on stage than 
those straights,” said associ-
ate dance professor Velma 
Kelly. “They aren’t so stiff all 
the time, and they tend to be 
much louder. And better look-
ing.”
There is no written policy 
for accepting students of cer-
tain sexual orientations to 
Carnegie Mellon’s School of 
Drama; the only collegiate in-
stitution that has any restric-
tion is the Julliard School, 
which requires that all male 
dance and theater majors 
identify as either gay or bi-
sexual. Those who identify 
as pansexual or any other ab-
stract sexual orientation, or 
decline to identify, are not ad-
mitted and are sent an email 
recommending that they ap-
ply to a liberal arts institution.
“We never ask a student’s 
sexual orientation upon au-
dition, nor at any subsequent 
time,” said professor of acting 
Moonrise Fitzgerald. “How-
ever, I admit that we do tend 
to accept students who come 
off as more... ?amboyant than 
others. At least if a male stu-
dent comes out as straight 
after we admit him, well, 
we don’t kick him out. Some 
schools would do so.”
Some drama students, 
while not overtly opposed to 
the new admittance policy, 
fear for their own livelihood in 
the program. “I can see where

“I like af?rmative action — I

imagine if they actually liked 
me? Gross! It’s so unnatural.”
There is a signi?cant fac-
tion of drama students, how-
ever, that plans to take the Cut 
by force to protest the policy. 
Frankie Smithers, a senior act-
ing major, is spearheading this 
effort. 
He gave only one com-
ment, directed at Cohon and

Frezza myth keeps mystifying students
PATRICK HOSKINS
PHI Frequenter
Students this week were 
shocked to hear about the 
return of Frezza to campus 
today. A man shrouded in 
myth, known only through 
graf?ti on the bathroom 
walls at Panther Hollow Inn 
(better known as PHI), Frez-
za has mysti?ed generations 
of Carnegie Mellon students.
Senior Ashley Garrett, a 
PHI regular, recounted what 
he knew of Frezza, saying, “I 
heard he can chug a pitcher 
of beer while wiring a bread-
board. He built a robot that 
runs on alcohol and was 
the basis for Bender from 
Futurama.”
Junior Carlos Giralt dis-
agreed, claiming Frezza was 
in fact an art student. “Frez-
za was the one that came 
up with the idea for Lobster 
Man, while doing Irish car 
bombs here on a Tuesday 
night. He got a grant to pay 
for his bar tab by showing 
it was all a performance art 
piece. Professors could do 
nothing during his critiques 
except weep at their own ir-
relevance.”
“That’s a load of horse 
rubbish,” said physics profes-
sor Kurt Langstrom. “One of 
my colleagues taught young 
Frezza. Was forced to give 
him an A after he came up 
with a new beer bong design 
that let you drink it twice 
as fast. Boy was a master of 
?uid dynamics. Came by all 
the time for physics PHI-day, 
back when I was a young ad-
junct.”
Soon, Frezza found his 
way back to his ancestral 
haunt in PHI. Perched on a 
stool with a pitcher of beer 
in one hand and a pitcher of 
shots in the other, he con-
?rmed all the myths. “I’m the 
rip-roarin-est, rootin-tootin-
est, drinkin-est, engineerin-
est, artin-est, sonuvab**** 
to ever walk through these 
doors. I’ll outdrink you, out-
draw you, outthink you, and 
seduce you. And yes, I do 
wear a blazer.”

Governor Tom Corbett    
(R-Pa.) announced plans to 
replace the soon-to-be-cut 
Port Authority bus routes with 
a new rickshaw service for the 
city of Pittsburgh last Thurs-
day. The proposal — originally 
suggested by ?fth-year mate-
rials science and engineering 
and biomedical engineer-
ing double major Matthew 
Biegler — was independently 
constructed by Corbett’s staff. 
The announcement comes af-
ter months of public concern 
over a dramatic reduction in 
bus service to become effec-
tive Sept. 2, 2013.
“This is an opportunity to 
implement new initiatives to 
save a struggling transit sys-
tem,” Corbett said. “With rick-
shaws, the Port Authority of 
Allegheny County will ?nally 
be able to pull its own weight.”
Corbett summarized the 
proposal, with rickshaws and 
other small wooden pull carts 
being phased into the transit 
system throughout the sum-
mer. “[The rickshaws] will 
replace buses on the 46 routes 
previously scheduled for elim-
ination, addressing the need 
for transit in these areas,” 
Corbett said. “We aim to fully 
integrate the carts into the 
system by early September, in 
time for the return of the Pitts-
burgh student population. It 
may be a long process, but we 
just need to keep putting one 
foot in front of the other.”
According to Corbett, the 
proposed rickshaw service 
is the collaborative effort of 
state legislation and the Port 
Authority Planning and De-
velopment Committee. Port 
Authority CEO Steve Bland 
expressed his excitement for 
the proposal in a statement.
“With a $64 million de?cit, 
it’s imperative that we ?nd 
cost-effective solutions while 
continuing to meet the transit 
needs of Pittsburgh,” Bland 
said. “For years we have been 
looking to Harrisburg to ad-
dress the ?aws of how Penn-
sylvania funds transit. It feels 
now that we’re ?nally taking a 
step in the right direction.”
Bland addressed concerns 
about travel times, speci?-
cally for the already hour-long 
28X route. Travelers should 
now expect a ?ve-hour trip, 
but Bland was sure that the 
improved rickshaw system 
would not face the typical de-
lays of a bus trip, “so the total 
travel time is about the same.”
Due to concerns from cur-
rent bus drivers, Bland has 
agreed to institute mandatory 
weighings of all passengers to 
keep the total rickshaw weight 
below 500 pounds. “While we 
recognize that weight dis-
crimination is a growing prob-
lem, we believe the cost sav-
ings to the employee health 
plan make this a requirement. 
Chiropractors are expensive.”
Corbett attempted to ad-
dress many additional con-
cerns that the plan raised. 
“While we realize that Pitts-
burgh’s infamous hills may 
prove troublesome for rick-
shaw pullers, uh…” he said. 
“Next question.”

Google paid $100 million 
yesterday for a tissue alleg-
edly used by Carnegie Mel-
lon computer science profes-
sor Luis von Ahn, who is most 
widely known as the founder 
and creator of the reCAPT-
CHA Internet application.
“When we received nu-
merous reports that the tis-
sue had been placed in a 
canister outside of von Ahn’s 
of?ce, we had to act quickly,” 
Google CEO Larry Page told 
the Associated Press.
Von Ahn’s reCAPTCHA, 
an online application used to 
verify that a user is not an In-
ternet bot, brought von Ahn 
to prominence in the mid-
2000s. Google acquired the 
application from von Ahn in 
2009, and the service is now 
used on popular sites such as 
Facebook, Ticketmaster, and 
Twitter.
Von Ahn will take the rest 
of the year off to work with 
Google on developing appli-
cations for his used tissues. 
One possibility is an integra-
tion into the Google+ social 
network. “It’s part of a long-
term strategy. We’ll use Face-
book to promote von Ahn’s 
work, and when people see 
what he has made everyone 
will join Google+,” Page 
said.
Many speculate that the 
tissue may eventually be sent 
out to the Scotland-based 
Roslin Institute, which in 
1996 cloned the ?rst mam-
mal—the female sheep “Dol-
ly.”
Google’s co-founder, Ser-
gey Brin, declined to com-
ment.
Prior to Google’s acquisi-
tion of the tissue, rumors had 
been circulating around the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
that the tissue was actually 
placed in the canister by a 
passing student, according to 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
“We acknowledge the ru-
mors, but they’re probably 
not true,” Page said. “Better 
safe than sorry.”

Juggler by Night
Marcus Abernathy, 22-
year owner of Abernathy 
Electronics in Squirrel Hill, 
made a real discovery last 
month: No one wants An-
droid tablets, but they’ll pay 
good money for a “broken 
iPad.”
“I’m always adjusting the 
layout of my store,” Aberna-
thy said. “I’m kind of a sci-
entist that way. Setting the 
VCRs above the TVs, or with 
the Walkmans, or putting 
the Microsoft Zunes with the 
record players — applying 
the scienti?c method to see 
what’s best for sales.”
Abernathy ?nds his exper-
iments can affect sales by al-
most 10 percent. On April 14, 
however, Abernathy made 
the discovery of his career.
“It happened by accident, 
really,” he said. “I had all 
these Android tablets and 
I hadn’t sold a single one. 
There’s the Transformer 
Prime, the Slider, the Decep-
ticon, the Sidewipe, the Bum-
blebee, and the Galaxy Tab 
8.9, and so on. Nobody uses 
any of them. I tried my usual 
technique of placing them 
with different merchandise, 
but even that wasn’t work-
ing.”
Abernathy said he started 
to despair.
“One evening I was closing 
up shop and accidentally put 
one of the Android tablets — 
it was a Transformer — in a 
bin labelled ‘Broken iPads.’ 
The next morning, it sold be-
fore lunchtime.”
Abernathy was shocked. “I 
knew I had something big,” 
he said.
In the interests of science, 
he decided to try it again. 
“This time I put a Xoom 2 in 
the ‘Old iPad’ bin. Now, the 
Xoom 2 is a terrible tablet. 
It gives a little whenever you 
pick it up, see? And the screen 
gets all greasy. It doesn’t even 
have 3G.” But again the tablet 
sold within hours when mar-
keted as a broken iPad.
With this in mind, Aberna-
thy tried slapping some spare 
Apple stickers onto the tab-
lets’ boxes. They ?ew off the 
shelves.
Abernathy says that after 
he sold 23 tablets in three 
days this way, he began to 
feel guilty. “I wondered if I 
was ripping people off,” he 
said. “Just because I can use 
Apple’s brand to sell more 
doesn’t mean that’s the right 
thing to do.”
So Abernathy began ask-
ing repeat customers what 
they thought of their tablets. 
“Joe [Schneider, a regular 
customer] came in the other 
day looking for some bat-
teries, and I says to him, 
‘Joe, how’s that broken iPad          
doing you?’”
Abernathy reports that 
Schneider was actually very 
pleased, and commented 
that iPads “sure have come 
a long way since the one he 
bought last.”
Abernathy plans to expand 
his strategy and transforms 
Abernathy Electronics into a 
knockoff Apple store. “I got 
the idea reading about those 
fake Apple stores in China. I 
figured ‘if they can do it, why 
can’t I?’ So I painted the walls 
black, put in more windows, 
and hired some hipsters to 
be unhelpful. Business shot 
through the roof.”
Abernathy contacted The 
Tartan because he cares about 
spreading knowledge. “As 
a sort of scientist, I don’t 
want to just sell 300 tablets a 
month and not reveal my dis-
covery,” he said. “I’ve really 
helped mankind here, and 
that’s what’s important. May-
be one day Google will invite 
me over and I can tell them 
how they can sell their prod-
ucts a little better. Turns out 
it’s pretty simple  — you just 
have to pretend to be Apple.”
Until then, Abernathy is 
satis?ed with being the No. 1 
retailer of Android tablets in 
Pennsylvania. “It’s my secret 
sauce,” he said, standing next 
to the “Broken iPads” sign 
that started it all.

Drunken Lout
First-year philosophy ma-
jor Chad Henderson (or “The 
Chadmeister” as he prefers), 
stunned the mathematics world 
today when he disproved in-
duction.
“So, like, we talked about 
induction in my Intro to Phi-
losophy class, and how it’s all 
B.S. and s***, and then the 
professor brought it up in my 
Concepts of Math class. I’m 
taking that ‘cause I’m smart 
and well rounded and s*** — 
ladies, come at me,” Hender-
son explained. “See, the pro-
fessor’s all like ‘We’re gonna 
use this to prove a bunch of 
cool stuff.’ And I just say, ‘Hold 
your horses Mr. Math! Induc-
tion’s not real!’ ”
Henderson disproved in-
duction through a clever coun-
terexample. “So every time I 
go to a party at my frat — go 
Sig Ep! — I always get a Natty. 
Like clockwork, man. But at 
our last party, get this, I took 
a PBR instead. And it’s not like 
they were out of Natty. I just 
decided to drink PBR instead. 
The prof couldn’t explain that, 
and neither could your pre-
cious induction.”
Henderson will be hon-
ored for his discovery with 
the Fields Medal — the high-
est prize given in mathematics  
reserved for mathematicians 
under 40 years old — and a 
$15,000 prize. At 19, Hender-
son is the youngest recipient 
yet. He plans to celebrate his 
achievement with a wicked 
rager at the Sigma Phi Epsilon 
frat house. No fatties allowed.
As Henderson rages on, 
the math world reels in the 
face of his tremendous discov-
ery. “It’s an exhilarating, and 
terrifying, time,” said Ernest 
Angstrom, an associate profes-
sor of math at the California 
Institute of Technology. “On 
the one hand, literally 90 per-
cent of mathematics is now 
false. Entire careers have been 
destroyed. The land around 
mathematics buildings every-
where is littered with the bod-
ies of those who couldn’t han-
dle it. But there’s a lot of stuff 
that needs to be proven again, 
which means a lot more prize 
money coming my way.”
Other mathematicians did 
not take it as gracefully as 
Angstrom. Professor Eugene 
Fenderfast plans to start a new 
branch of mathematics which 
says “Nuh-uh!” and uses in-
duction anyway. “I’ll not have 
my work destroyed by an inso-
lent whelp!” Fenderfast said, 
ignoring how much he sound-
ed like a Scooby-Doo villain.
Henderson will achieve 
doctorates in both philosophy 
and mathematics at gradu-
ation, and will also serve as 
student speaker. “Yeah, I’ve 
already started working on 
my speech,” he said. “I’m tak-
ing inspiration from those 
great 20th-century philoso-
phers, Bill and Ted, and tell-
ing everyone to ‘party on.’ 
In short, drink Natty, party 
hard, and treat women with 
respect.”

Hysterical Feminist
The ratings for campus 
radio station WRCT have 
soared in the past week, with 
a 300 percent increase in its 
online streaming listeners 
alone. The reason behind this 
sudden burst in popularity? A 
new DJ, Pittsburgh resident 
Wilhelm “The Dictator” Mar-
tin, who has quickly garnered 
a cult following thanks to his 
nonstop broadcasts.
“He like, kind of wan-
dered into the radio station 
last Tuesday,” WRCT general 
manager Kitty Salvador ex-
plained. “I think he got con-
fused because he like, kept 
saying that this was a soup 
kitchen? But he saw the radio 
studio and, it was like it was 
his calling, you know? He told 
me that the station spoke to 
him, which I totally get.”
Martin, who is instantly 
recognizable in the station 
thanks to his mane-like beard 
and tinfoil suit, hasn’t left the 
radio station since arriving, 
but rather has been broad-
casting a mix of a personal 
talk show and musical se-
lections consisting of static-
?lled cassette tapes he claims 
are the government’s record-
ings of his time in the womb.
“You can’t trust the dogs 
— they whisper all your se-
crets in the night to the rats 
that work in the CIA,” he said 
during an afternoon broad-
cast yesterday. “They only 
call me schizo because I know 
the truth about the particle 
collider and the cheese fac-
tory!”
The transition to Martin’s 
nonstop broadcasts hasn’t 
been an easy one. “He kinda 
was freaked out by the com-
puters in the production stu-
dio, because he thought the 
CIA or FBI or whatever could 
control his brain them,” Sal-
vador said. “But we put alu-
minum foil on them and now 
he’s like, super chill about it.”
There were also initially 
issues with him monopoliz-
ing air time. “I was kinda 
peeved at ?rst about him be-
ing on the air all the time, be-
cause I’ve got electronic mini-
mal experimental folk that 
the listening public wants to 
hear, you know?” said fellow 
WRCT DJ Dennison Quaid. 
“But The Dictator’s broadcast 
is, like, such a totally radical 
and subversively ironic com-
mentary on our society, so 
it’s like, mad respect, man. I 
actually have this amazingly 
ironic anti-establishment 
quote from his show that I 
want to get tattooed on my 
forearm — in Helvetica, of 
course.”
Overall, the feedback 
from the community about 
Martin’s show has been over-
whelmingly positive. “The 
Dictator [ITAL]knows[ITAL] 
things, man,” said Barry Low-
ell, a homeless man who was 
blasting a broadcast of Mar-
tin’s show through his stereo 
on Forbes Avenue near the 
Cathedral of Learning. “He 
tells me all sorts of great s*** 
about how to keep the gov-
ernment from recording me. 
Hey, got any beer on you?”
Senior computer science 
major Ned Collins agreed that 
the new programming has 
been an improvement. “At 
?rst, I couldn’t even tell they 
had a new DJ, because there 
was this guy talking about the 
government over static, and I 
was pretty sure I’d heard that 
on an experimental show on 
the station two months ago,” 
he said. “But then I realized 
that this guy’s hilarious. Me 
and my friends actually lis-
ten to WRCT now. We made 
up this drinking game where 
you take a drink every time 
he mentions the government, 
an appliance singing to him, 
or his conversations with 
Goliath. The ?rst time we 
played, I was puking in less 
than an hour. It was totally 
awesome.”

Single and Looking, Ladies
Scotch’n’Soda’s new 
show “Somewhat Dull with 
a Lot of Sex Jokes” pre-
miered last week to thun-
derous apathy. The show 
was a startling break from 
the norm, featuring more 
attempts to be edgy and 
even worse jokes.
Written by junior Eng-
lish major Mitch McKay, he 
said he “wanted to show 
everyone how self-involved 
Scotch’n’Soda really is. I 
wanted to write something 
with a lot of sex in it, be-
cause that’s totally edgy and 
cool. Then I added some 
jokes that only my friends 
and I will know.”
The director did a great 
job of having actors walk on 
stage, say their lines, and 
then walking off. The sets 
were entirely adequate, and 
the lights did a great job of 
lighting the stage.
The high point of the 
night had to be the rousing 
musical number “Closet,” in 
which every character came 
out of the closet, including 
those who were out of the 
closet to begin with.
“I needed a cheap way 
to manufacture drama and 
character development,” 
McKay explained, “and 
there’s no easier way than 
having characters ques-
tion their sexuality. It really 
makes my job easier.”
First-year math major 
Dan Sherwood played the 
lead character, Lance Ga-
lahad, who experiences 
an astonishing lack of any 
personal development or 
humor. When asked about 
the play, he raved about 
everyone’s performances 
— especially his own — be-
fore going on to brag about 
how he hadn’t slept once for 
the past three months of re-
hearsal.
However, not everyone 
was so impressed. “I’m not 
in Scotch’n’Soda, and I’m 
not currently hitting on 
anyone who is, so I have no 
reason to go to their shows,” 
junior design major Sara 
McNutty explained. “I did 
accidentally wander into 
McConomy for one perfor-
mance right as they started 
a song about genital mutila-
tion. At that point I got out 
of there as soon as I could.”
Overall, the show was a 
departure from what you 
expect from Scotch’n’Soda 
performances. Everyone at 
Carnegie Mellon should be 
sure to see “Somewhat Dull 
with a Lot of Sex Jokes” 
before they start rehears-
ing for next year’s play, 
“Startlingly Mediocre with 
a Different Amount of Sex 
Jokes.”

Incredibly Handsome
Local haberdash Marcus 
Kirkpatrick had always been 
on the edge of bankruptcy. 
“The fedora industry isn’t 
what it once was. Back in my 
father’s day, everyone wanted 
to look like Humphrey Bogart, 
and they needed a hat to go 
with each suit. But since then 
fewer and fewer people have 
wanted fedoras,” he said.
However, Kirkpatrick has 
received help from an unlikely 
source: KGB. 
Kirkpatrick traces the re-
cent upsurge in fedora sales to 
the premiere of Mad Men six 
years ago, which caused many 
hipsters to purchase fedoras.
“Mad Men was the start of 
a new golden age in haber-
dashery. Fedoras were sud-
denly cool again, and every-
one wanted one,” Kirkpatrick 
said. However, fedoras quickly 
soon fell out of fashion once 
hipsters realized they were un-
comfortable and only looked 
good with a suit.
But as hipsters stopped 
buying hats, members of KGB 
stepped up to take their place. 
Always two steps behind 
trends, KGB has embraced fe-
doras with unyielding verve. 
“The hat covers up how greasy 
my hair is, so I can go even lon-
ger without showering,” soph-
omore computer science ma-
jor Reese Manderly explained.
Kirkpatrick was initially 
?ummoxed by these new cus-
tomers, but recognized an 
opportunity when he saw it. 
“I expanded my offerings to 
include really long scarves 
and trenchcoats. That way if 
someone’s on the fence I can 
say they look like that Dr. Who 
fella or that guy from Fire?y in 
the coat and they’ll shell out 
$500.”
Senior electrical and com-
puter engineering major Burt 
Macklin said, “My entire 
wardrobe comes from Kirkpat-
rick’s shop. I have the greatest 
combination of trenchcoats, 
shorts, free T-shirts, and hats 
at CMU.” 
Considered a trendsetter in 
KGB, Macklin has created his 
own unique look, despite the 
protestations of everyone who 
has to look at him.
Kirkpatrick is hopeful for 
the future of his business. 
“I’m not going to sit idly by 
any more,” he said. “I’m go-
ing to take my money and ex-
pand even more, this time into 
cloaks. KGB has already preor-
dered forty of them. When the 
next Hobbit movie comes out, 
I’ll be rolling in dough.”

When questioned about the 
fundamental purpose of Stu-
dent College (StuCo) courses 
at Carnegie Mellon, StuCo 
executive committee mem-
ber Barney Ross stated that 
“imparting useful, thought-
provoking, and otherwise un-
available knowledge unto the 
student populous at large” is a 
central pillar of the StuCo mis-
sion statement. “For the 2013 
fall semester,” he said, “we are 
for the ?rst time trying to ad-
dress a speci?c, widely accept-
ed student knowledge de?cit, 
and are allowing a pair of non-
CMU students to teach a Stu-
Co entitled “Pop Pop: How to 
Party like you go to Pitt.”
Brothers Dom and Brian 
Winton, both upperclass stu-
dents of business at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, will co-
teach a self-authored course 
covering both elementary 
and intermediate party-going 
techniques. 
When asked what inspired 
their decision to teach at Carn-
egie Mellon, Brian Winton 
replied, “A couple of months 
ago we crashed a party in the 
basement of Sigma Chi, and 
were shocked and outraged at 
the state of CMU party affairs. 
The ?oors were clean, the guy-
to-girl ratio was unnervingly 
high, and we even ran into one 
girl who was walking around 
with her self-respect show-
ing.”
The Winton brothers ad-
mitted that they have “liter-
ally no respect” for Carnegie 
Mellon, citing the student 
populace as “pretentious” and 
“deeply, unsettlingly unat-
tractive,” but also conceded 
that no male college student 
should have to party in such 
destitute conditions.
“College is about getting 
your nut,” Brian Winton said. 
“We’re all just trying to gradu-
ate. Be in and be out. For the 
rep. YOLO. Swag. Feel me? 
Hashtag Cîroc, hashtag Young 
Money.”
According to Dom Winton, 
the class will be divided into 
theoretical and applied seg-
ments. “For the ?rst month 
or whatever, we’ll take them 
back to basics, you know? 
How to go hard, the signs 
that your shirt is about to be 
yacked on, what to do when 
your shirt gets yacked on, both 
male and female yack scenari-
os, the etymology of the word 
yack, the origins of “YOLO,” 
how to get a dollar sign dol-
lar sign while maintaining a 
political career, the long-term 
effects of casual alcoholism, 
you know. Hashtag Gingrich, 
hashtag MadRespect.”
The theoretical arm of the 
class will include guest lec-
tures from campus and com-
munity members spanning 
a variety of topics, including 
Jessica Noble’s award-win-
ning Self-Respect: Park it at 
the Door, Sister and a segment 
President Jared Cohon is cur-
rently preparing on “the dan-
gers of not going balls to the 
wall as often as possible be-
fore graduating with a degree 
in civil and environmental en-
gineering.”
“Students will be encour-
aged to discuss the content at 
the end of each class,” Dom 
Winton said, “and one student 
each week will have the op-
portunity to give a three- to 
?ve-minute presentation on 
his or her conception. Hashtag 
MistakesOfLastSemester.”
The applied segment of 
the class will take place Sat-
urday evenings, and will allow 
students to test the practical 
applications of their newly 
acquired knowledge. When 
asked about the intended dif?-
culty of the course, Dom Win-
ton said it wouldn’t be easy to 
pass.
“[The students] are gonna 
hit tennis parties, soccer par-
ties, archie parties, drama 
parties, frat parties, faculty 
parties, Chatham parties, the

Yes, that’s his card in the 
picture
The heart of the cards 
means nothing to a hardcore 
Magic: The Gathering (MTG) 
player — and this seems es-
pecially true at Carnegie 
Mellon. Intramural officials 
forcibly disbanded the uni-
versity’s MTG club last week, 
due to across-the-board dop-
ing. Every member of the 
club, which competed inter-
nationally, admitted to hav-
ing used or was in possession 
of performance enhancers.
“Some of us went to ex-
tremes — which was prob-
ably how those idiots got 
caught — but most of us just 
marked our cards somehow,” 
said club member senior Ak-
roma Mackenzie. “I person-
ally use different scents of 
perfume and cologne to get 
the cards I need to the top 
of my deck after shuffling. 
It worked for Mai Valentine 
from Yu-Gi-Oh, and it works 
for me.”
Club president, senior 
Roark Mosswater — known 
by friends and fans as Romo 
— went to such extremes. 
After years of experimenting 
with methods of enhancing 
his game, Mosswater became 
obsessed with the idea of a 
one-turn win. 
“It turns out that pulling 
a gun on your opponent to 
make them concede is illegal, 
even though the MTG hand-
book doesn’t say anything 
about it,” Mosswater said, 
referring to an incident at a 
2011 tournament in Sweden. 
Wizards of the Coast, the 
company that owns Magic: 
The Gathering, banned Moss-
water from casual and tour-
nament play for a year.
In that time, Mosswater 
— a chemistry major — de-
veloped a compound that 
enhances playing ability. 
According to club member 
sophomore Toshiro Umeza-
wa, who actively used the 
drug, it heightens awareness 
about the opponent’s micro-
expressions, and simultane-
ously makes the player more 
perceptive of “combos” be-
tween different cards. Moss-
water calls it a “mana-bolic 
steroid.”
“It’s the perfect playing-
card steroid. I usually run a 
mono-blue control, so with 
mana-bolics helping me read 
my opponent’s play style and 
deck substance, I can counter 
anything important he does 
then use Jace to deck him,” 
Umezawa said. 
A day after the club offi-
cially disbanded, Mosswater 
was sent to a holding facil-
ity, and government officials 
arrived on campus to confis-
cate any and all remaining 
samples of the mana-bolics. 
“The implications for interro-
gation and scientific progress 
with this drug are immense 
and unfathomable,” said as-
sociate chemistry professor 
Draco Niv-Mizzet. “And these 
little assholes wanted to keep 
it to themselves so they could 
cheat at their children’s card 
game. Really cool, guys. Way 
to go.”
When asked about the 
club’s future, Mosswater 
shrugged. “I don’t really care, 
honestly. Toshi will probably 
take it over,” he said, picking 
his nose. “I’m more focused 
on starting a new club at 
the county jail, where I’ll be 
spending most of my time 
for the next 15 years. People 
have surprisingly little to do 
there.”

While initially excited 
to be acquired by the New 
York Jets, after one season 
quarterback Tim Tebow has 
renounced his faith. “If God 
were real, he would not 
have sent me to New Jer-
sey,” Tebow said at a recent 
press conference.
The announcement 
came as a surprise to fel-
low players and the legions 
of Tebow fans. The young 
quarterback became fa-
mous for his string of wins 
in his second year with the 
Denver Broncos, as well as 
his outward expressions of 
faith on and off the field.
The rising quarterback 
star repeated the phrase 
“God is dead,” numerous 
times throughout the con-
ference. “Either that, or the 
devil is alive and well in 
Denver,” Tebow said, refer-
ring to former Indianapolis 
Colts quarterback Peyton 
Manning, who was acquired 
by the Denver Broncos and 
replaced Tebow.
The state of New Jer-
sey released a formal re-
sponse to Tebow’s loss of 
faith. “Yeah, well, he don’t 
believe in God no more 
or something, right? If he 
thinks that his time here in 
the great state of New Jer-
sey has been some kinda 
punishment or something, 
screw ’em,” New Jersey 
said. “He’s got some nerve, 
I’m tellin ya.”
New Jersey garbage man 
Sal Romano was not sur-
prised by Tebow’s loss of 
faith. “Hey, it’s Jersey. The 
only God we pray to is Bruce 
f****** Springsteen.”
Tebow’s many fans are 
left wondering what is to 
become of his career. The 
young quarterback often at-
tributed his prowess on the 
field to the omnipotent be-
ing. Will Tebow’s athiestic 
conversion affect his first 
down conversions? Will he 
finally stop kneeling every-
where? Only time will tell.

Plans went into motion 
yesterday to put down ju-
nior CIA buggy pusher Oliver 
Bellafonte. Bellafonte had 
sprained his ankle during rolls 
early Saturday morning, leav-
ing him incapable of pushing 
for Buggy, among other ac-
tivities such as walking.
CIA chair Donald Meyer 
said that the organization 
came to the decision to put 
down Bellafonte after much 
deliberation. “Bellafonte has 
been with us for quite a few 
seasons now, and we sure 
have grown fond of him. But 
this is no way to live, not be-
ing able to push anymore. 
We’re obligated to put him 
out of his misery,” he said.
Buggy competitor eutha-
nasia is not entirely uncom-
mon. Sophomore Fringe 
driver Ashley Higgens was 
put down in 2009 after being 
unable to compete due to a 
growth spurt.
“Forcing these competitors 
to continue living while not 
being able to race in Buggy 
is inhumane,” Sweepstakes 
chair Nikhil Valjee said. “It’s 
regrettable, but necessary.”
Still, the decision was met 
met with much controversy. 
People for the Ethical Treat-
ment of Buggy Competitors 
(PETBC) will be staging a 
protest on Frew Street. PET-
BC president Leslie Steinfeld 
issued a statement, saying, 
“Putting down a buggy pusher 
of a mild injury is inhumane 
and unethical. Buggy compet-
itors should be treated with 
the dignity they deserve!”
PETBC, a PETA offshoot, is 
well known within the Buggy 
community. “They’ve been 
plaguing us for years,” Valjee 
said. “Every time we make 
pushers practice early in the 
morning, or bind driver’s feet 
so they stay small, PETBC 
is there, protesting all the 
while.” PETBC is not an of-
?cially recognized af?liate of 
PETA, who said in a statement 
that they don’t support “lost 
causes.”
Despite PETBC’s best ef-
fort, the Buggy status quo 
will continue as usual. “Look, 
I love buggy as much as the 
next guy, and I know how 
much these competitors love 
it. If they can’t race, then they 
don’t even want to keep on 
living,” Meyer said. “Buggy is 
just as great and valid a sport 
as horse — or even chariot — 
racing. If it was good enough 
for the Roman Colosseum, 
it’s good enough for Carnegie 
Mellon.”
When asked for a state-
ment, Bellafonte’s family 
said, “It’s for the best. All the 
boy cared about was Buggy. 
He was dead as soon as he 
sprained that ankle.”
CIA still plans to compete, 
stating that its deep stable 
of pushers will be more than 
enough to propel them to vic-
tory.

Really more of a Twilight fan
After the success and 
popularity of Quidditch at 
Carnegie Mellon, President 
Jared Cohon announced 
the inclusion of the Hunger 
Games in Carnegie Mellon’s 
intramural sports, following 
the trend of sports based on 
children’s literature.
“The novels have been ex-
tremely popular with people 
of all ages, and the ?rst movie 
made my grandchildren have 
conniptions — with joy, of 
course,” Cohon said. “Carn-
egie Mellon is dedicated to 
innovation, and this seems 
like the perfect opportunity 
to implement these exciting, 
masochistic games.”
The games will involve 
the recruitment of local high 
school and middle school 
students as tributes in a bat-
tle to the death. Two students 
per school district will be of-
fered up. The winner will re-
ceive admittance into Carn-
egie Mellon (as well as his or 
her life). No scholarship will 
be awarded, although ?nan-
cial recognition for extraor-
dinary accomplishment in 
a survival competition may 
be possible through outside 
institutions or advertising 
proceeds.
At Carnegie Mellon, stu-
dents are expected to work 
themselves to death.
Since [ital]The Hunger 
Games[ital] book series de-
buted in 2008, higher school-
ers have been studying ob-
sessively. “I have wanted to 
be Katniss my whole life,” 
exclaimed a local sophomore 
who would only identify 
herself as Katniss Everdeen. 
“I’ve been training for ages: 
reblogging movie clips, read-
ing the books again, liking 
Hunger Games pictures on 
Pinterest. I even skipped a 
meal once. It was accidental, 
but it shows I’m prepared.”
Central Catholic senior 
Joseph Gale is sure he’ll 
come out on top. “I’ve been 
playing Halo for years, I 
don’t think ?ghting to death 
should be any harder than 
pwning noobs. You know 
that guy who brags about do-
ing your mom? Yeah, that’s 
me. Attention high school-
ers, get ready to have your 
a**** kicked.”
Current Carnegie Mellon 
students have mixed feelings 
on the announcement. Sarah 
Welch, a junior chemical en-
gineering major, loves the 
idea. “People always com-
plain that nothing exciting 
goes on around campus. An 
adolescent bloodbath would 
really help bring some festiv-
ity to CMU,” she said
Kyle Dorian, ?rst-year 
statistics major, feels differ-
ently. “I think it’s unfair. We 
had to study for weeks for 
SATs, score ?ves on all of the 
AP tests, and write countless 
application essays for just 
the chance to get into CMU,” 
Dorian said. “The tributes 
will have it too easy.”

Beta Theta Pi suspended over sexually explicit recordings
JACKSON LANE
Senior Staffwriter
In an email to the entire 
campus community sent last 
Friday, Dean of Student Affairs 
Gina Casalegno announced 
that the university is investi-
gating allegations regarding 
the ?lming and circulation of 
sexually explicit photos and 
videos in the university’s chap-
ter of the national Beta Theta 
Pi fraternity. The university 
is also investigating whether 
these alleged videos and pic-
tures will constitute a viola-
tion of the university’s com-
munity standards or the law. 
Pending the outcome of the 
investigation, both the uni-
versity and the fraternity’s na-
tional chapter have suspended 
the university’s chapter, collo-
quially referred to by students 
as “Beta.”
According to Casalegno, 
University Police initiated 
the ongoing investigation af-
ter an anonymous student 
raised concerns about “al-
leged videos and pictures of 
a sexual nature being taken 
inside the chapter facility of 
the Beta Theta Pi fraternity by 
certain members of the orga-
nization and shared by email 
with other members [of the 
fraternity].”
In a press release on the 
school’s website, the univer-
sity stated, “CMU’s top prior-
ity is the safety, security, and 
well-being of our community. 
Carnegie Mellon does not con-
done nor tolerate violations of 
university community stan-
dards or the law.” The univer-
sity states that it will pursue 
internal disciplinary actions 
against the fraternity and its 
members if they are found to 
have violated the university’s 
community standards. The 
university also intends to re-
fer any evidence of criminal 
wrongdoing to law enforce-
ment of?cials.
The university has not yet 
elaborated on the exact na-
ture of any alleged community 
standards violations or legal 
infractions. Rather, Casalegno 
emphasized, “The investiga-
tion is ongoing, and we do not 
yet know the circumstances of 
the capturing or the sharing of 
images or precisely what vio-
lations of University policy or 
the law may have taken place.”

Four Carnegie Mellon se-
niors launched PayTango, a 
?ngerprint-based payment 
method that eliminates the 
need for identi?cation and 
debit cards. Senior informa-
tion systems majors Brian 
Groudan, Umang Patel, and 
Christian Reyes, and senior 
human-computer interaction 
and industrial design double 
major Kelly Lau-Kee devel-
oped PayTango in the Tech 
Startup Lab course taught by 
computer science assistant 
professor Luis von Ahn in fall 
2012.
Groudan, Lau-Kee, Patel, 
and Reyes effectively com-
bined their talents to search 
for a solution to a universal 
problem: People have to car-
ry around too many cards. 
Credit cards can be lost, card 
numbers can be stolen, and 
it can be a hassle to pull out 
a card while holding a cup 
brimming with hot coffee. 
They invented a much 
easier method of payment 
that uses ?ngerprints instead 
of cards.
“Biometrics was a really 
good way for us to explore 
how to eliminate the need 
to carry around extra ‘stuff’ 
to identify yourself. And 
that’s kind of the vision that 
we have moving forward, is 
that through the use of bio-
metrics, we can strengthen 
the security to verify that a 
person is [who they say they 
are]…. There are a lot of ap-
plications,” Lau-Kee said.
PayTango allows people 
to pay using two ?ngerprints. 
The ?rst time someone en-
rolls with the system, they 
must swipe their card as 
their ?ngers are placed on 
the scanner. 
It takes around 10–15 sec-
onds to associate the card 
data with the person’s bio-
metric data. 
Then, when that person 
returns, they can use their 
card by simply scanning their 
?ngerprints, a process that 
takes only a few seconds.
Although he does not yet 
use PayTango, sophomore 
mechanical engineering ma-
jor Michael O’Connor said, 
“This seems like an amazing 
technology that will make 
my life much easier and that 
will protect people’s ?nancial 
information.”
The PayTango founders 
did not originally think their 
idea would turn in to a full-
?edged business. 
According to Lau-Kee, 
the ?rst time they consid-
ered starting a company was 
when they participated in 
the University of Pennsylva-
nia PennApps hackathon, the 
largest college hackathon in 
the world. 
Groudan, Patel, and Reyes 
attended the hackathon and 
built the device using only 
an iPad, a ?ngerprint reader, 
and a magnetic card reader. 
The product was demoed 
and received recognition and 
multiple awards, demon-
strating its viability.
PayTango has come far 
since the PennApps hack-
athon. Last Tuesday, the 
company graduated from Y 
Combinator, an incubator 
program in Mountain View, 
California that supports the 
development of entrepre-
neurial companies. 
After successfully com-
pleting the three-month 
program along with 46 
other businesses, Groudan, 
Lau-Kee, Patel, and Reyes 
demoed PayTango in front 
of more than 500 investors, 
including many prominent 
Silicon Valley entities.
“We’re still amazed that 
we’ve gotten this far,” Lau-
Kee said.
The business is currently 
going through its ?rst round 
of funding. Additionally, 
PayTango has been installed 
at multiple dining locations 
within Carnegie Mellon, in-
cluding The Underground, 
Skibo Café, and the Ex-
change. 
PayTango dances its way to success
Sparse attendance at election debates 
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Assistant News Editor
Candidates for student 
body president (SBP), stu-
dent body vice president 
(SBVP), student body vice 
president of ?nance (SB-
VPF), and student body vice 
president of organizations 
(SBVPO) responded to ques-
tions about their platforms 
in Monday’s and Tuesday’s 
student government election 
debates. The president and 
vice presidential debate, held 
on Monday in McConomy 
Auditorium, featured Lindsay 
MacGillivray, a junior biol-
ogy and psychology major, 
and Peter Masters, a sopho-
more international relations 
and politics and environ-
mental policy double major, 
against Thomas Healy, a ju-
nior mechanical engineering 
and engineering and public 
policy double major, and 
Caitlin Jones, a junior busi-
ness administration major. 
The audience for the debate 
was sparse; fewer than 20 
of McConomy’s seats were 
?lled.
In addition to represent-
ing the student body’s wishes 
in their decision-making, the 
positions eligible for election 
play an instrumental role in 
dictating the functioning of 
crucial student government 
organizations including the 
Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC) and Committee on Stu-
dent Organizations (CoSO).
The debate began with 
questions asked every year, 
including “What do you be-
lieve is the most important 
role of student government?” 
and “An issue each year is 
how to make student govern-
ment more approachable to 
the general campus, and to 
generate a sense of transpar-
ency — would you say that 
this year’s student govern-
ment has done a good job 
at generating that sense of 
transparency and being ap-
proachable?”
An important part of 
Healy and Jones’ platform is 
the spreading of school spirit.
“We already have a great 
athletics program in place, 
and it’s just a matter of stu-
dents knowing when these 
events are taking place,” 
Jones said.
The second part of the 
presidential and vice presi-
dential debate began with a 
question about Carnegie Mel-
lon’s campus culture: “How 
do you see the student body 
president’s role in addressing 
stress culture and how would 
you address it if elected?”
Healy emphasized the role 
of the student body president 
as implementing ideas, rather 
than coming up with them.
“We’re not going to be the 
ones who come up with the 
ideas of how to cure every 
problem at Carnegie Mellon; 
we’re two students within 
this university. I think the 
university itself and the staff 
of the university are going to 
come up with those ideas…. 
Our main role is going to be 
backing [the administration] 
up on their initiatives.”
MacGillivray continued 
the theme of carrying out 
proposed ideas by addressing 
the perspective of students, 
saying, “I do feel like the 
student body needs to feel 
empowered to speak up for 
themselves and to say ‘this is 
something I want to take on; 
these are the ways in which 
my impact could really help 
campus.’ ”
After the debate, some on-
lookers thought that the can-
didates lacked speci?city.
“They didn’t address spe-
ci?cs; when they answered 
my question they basically 
both said that they were go-
ing to hold a bunch of meet-
ings,” said senior economics 
major Bryan Wade.
Amy Quispe, a senior com-
puter science major who ran 
for student body president 
last year with Wade, agreed. 
“I was thoroughly unim-

Armed Robbery 
March 23, 2013
University Police were 
summoned to take a report 
of an armed robbery. A stu-
dent stated that while leaving 
a party on Wilkins Avenue, a 
black male in a silver sedan 
pulled alongside the sidewalk 
and offered the student a ride 
back to campus. 
Due to the student being 
intoxicated, he only recalled 
various parts of his encounter 
with this unknown male. The 
student does remember the 
male pulling out a handgun 
and ordering him to hand over 
all of his personal belongings. 
The unknown male then 
ordered the student out of the 
vehicle. This investigation is 
ongoing.

Seven multidisciplinary 
Carnegie Mellon students 
took ?rst place in a Depart-
ment of Energy competition 
against 14 university teams 
to create strategies that cut 
energy waste and improve ef-
?ciency among commercial 
buildings.
The Carnegie Mellon 
team received the “Most In-
novative” award for its entry, 
which strives to increase en-
ergy ef?ciency in commercial 
and industrial buildings in 
Fort Worth, Texas by the year 
2020. The team also won 
“Best Proposal” for its “Every-
thing Store” case study.
 Team members include 
electrical and computer engi-
neering master’s student Jie 
Yee Chan; architecture Ph.D. 
students Adrian Chong and 
Chao Ding; business master’s 
student Donald Johnson; and 
engineering and public policy 
(EPP) Ph.D. candidates Alan 
Jenn, Mili-Ann Tamayao, and 
Allison Weis.
“The team was up against 
some challenging competi-
tion, and this is where the 
practical problem-solving, 
interdisciplinary approach 
that is the culture at Carn-
egie Mellon shines through,” 
said team adviser and head of 
Carnegie Mellon’s School of 
Architecture Stephen R. Lee. 
“The jury was particularly 
impressed with the sophisti-
cation of the computer-based 
performance simulation of 
the cases done by the School 
of Architecture students in 
the Center for Building Per-
formance and Diagnostics.”
“This is wonderful recog-
nition for our CMU students 
as they use skills and experi-
ence in a wide range of disci-
plines from engineering and 
?nance to urban planning 
and public policy,” said M. 
Granger Morgan, head of the 
EPP program and director of

Students to test innovative paper airplane
Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents in the mechanical 
engineering and civil and 
environmental engineering 
departments will have the 
opportunity to test ?y the 
world’s most innovative pa-
per aircraft, built by Guin-
ness World Record paper-
airplane ?yer John Collins 
at the Steinbrenner Institute 
Environmental Expo.
Collins will usher in the 
second annual Steinbrenner 
Institute Environmental 
Expo with elaborate demos 
of ?ying machines made out 
of paper. Collins’ designs 
sprout from the ancient art 
of origami, and he works to 
create the most sleek, aero-
dynamic airplanes.
“These exciting paper air-
plane demos are a great way 
to better understand aerody-
namics and to focus atten-
tion on the environment in 
which we work and play,” 
said Jayon Wang, a senior 
mechanical engineering ma-
jor and the leader of Carn-
egie Mellon’s chapter of the 
American Institute of Aero-
nautics and Astronautics.
The Steinbrenner Insti-
tute Environmental Expo 
will be held on April 24 from 
4–6 p.m. in Rangos 2 and 3 
in the University Center. The 
event showcases the best 
environmental research and 
sustainability projects occur-
ring across Carnegie Mel-
lon’s campus.

Senate discussed and voted 
upon funding for the Arts 
Pass program. Student Ac-
tivities is now in its second 
year of collecting data on 
use of the Arts Pass pro-
gram, and encouraged Stu-
dent Senate to continue its 
funding. Student Senate 
voted to fund the Arts Pass 
program for $18,000.Compiled by

Student Body President 
Will Weiner addressed the 
Senate regarding proposed 
changes to the student body 
election bylaws. 
The changes proposed 
ensure that students running 
for student body president of-
?cially have a vice presiden-
tial candidate on their ticket; 
and that campaign spending 
is limited to $500, with the 
maximum value of an item 
that can be given to an indi-
vidual being $25. 
Additionally, the value 
of items used in a campaign 
are also counted against this 
$500 total, so that individu-
als with special connections 
on the pricing of items do not 
gain an unfair advantage.
Table sharing proposal
As part of an initiative 
designed to address over-
crowding in spaces such as 
the University Center and 
Tazza D’Oro, Student Sen-
ate installed signs that can be 
placed on a table that occu-
pants are willing to share with 
someone else. This program is 
designed to maximize seating 
and avoid situations in which 
large tables are occupied by 
only one person each.
Chair Report
The Chair Report to the 
Student Senate addressed 
meetings held with busi-
ness owners on Craig Street. 
There is a proposed Town 
Hall meeting, to be held 
with businesses on Craig 
Street, to address Carnegie 
Mellon’s changing culture 
and the possibilities for in-
corporating Craig Street as a 
social area for the Carnegie 
Mellon community.
As part of the Senate 
With You outreach event, 
there are plans to erect a 
large advertising balloon on 
campus April 8–10, and for 
students to sign the balloon 
with what their dreams are. 
The balloon will be in?ated 
and left on the CFA lawn 
until ?nal exams.

Debates leave students wanting details
pressed with the candidates. 
They did a very good job of re-
iterating how they were going 
to crowd source student ideas, 
and then ?nd other students 
to implement these ideas for 
them, and then take credit.”
“I think that tends to hap-
pen in these debates and in 
these large elections: The 
platforms are generally very 
broad pictures,” said Anshul 
Dhankher, a junior chemical 
and biomedical engineering 
double major.
Dhankher also emphasized 
the importance of experience 
for presidential and vice presi-
dential candidates. “I would 
say that Lindsay and Peter’s 
side — both sides have great 
experience — was a little 
more speci?c in terms of con-
crete ideas and experience in 
student government. Espe-
cially on Peter’s side, with JFC 
and CoSO, that [experience 
is] almost necessary to have, 
going forward.”
Tuesday’s debates for SB-
VPF and SBVPO, held in Ran-
gos Hall, had even fewer at-
tendees than Monday’s.
The ?rst debate, for SBVPF, 
was between Joshua Swan-
son, a sophomore psychology 
and statistics double major, 
and Jaden Potea, a sophomore 
statistics major.
Several debate questions 
asked the candidates about 
how they would strengthen 
communication among stu-
dent organization leaders, 
other branches of student gov-
ernment, and the JFC, which 
allocates money for organiza-
tions’ budgets.
Potea advocated for a 
more transparent approach, 
keeping the JFC and SBVPF 
in constant communication 
with other key ?gures like the 
Student Senate and Graduate 
Students Association’s (GSA) 
?nance chairs.
“One thing I would like to 
do is work with either the ?-
nance chairs to just make sure 
that the JFC’s rationale, their 
reasoning is supplied to them 
in detail…. I think it’s impor-
tant to make sure the reason-
ing the JFC used to budget a 
certain way, to make sure that 
that knowledge is available,” 
he said.
Swanson, too, advocated 
increased communication be-
tween various heads of stu-
dent government.
“I also think continuing 
with the of?ce hours between 
the SBVPF and the SBVPO 
is important, because we do 
overlap in a lot of areas,” he 
said. “It’s going to be very 
close; both of them have 
strong platforms and strong 
ideas. It’s going to be about 
who can muster the most sup-
port,” said Vivek Nair, a junior 
electrical and computer engi-
neering major and member of 
Student Senate.
“It’s going to be interest-
ing because last year it was an 
uncontested position. The fact 
remains that the platform for 
SBVPF doesn’t have that much 
?exibility. How they can dif-
ferentiate themselves from 
that description is what’ll de-
?ne this election,” Nair said.
The debate for SBVPO 
included junior psychology 
major Corinne Rockoff, soph-
omore business administra-
tion major Susanna Park, and 
sophomore mathematics and 
economics double major Rad-
owan Khan.
The Bridge, a website for 
campus organizations, was an 
important part of the SBVPO 
debate. Candidates all empha-
sized its utility when answer-
ing the question, “How will 
you ensure student organiza-
tion leaders use The Bridge to 
its full potential, and how will 
you use The Bridge to help 
student organizations?”
All of the candidates 
agreed that many organiza-
tion leaders and students were 
not fully aware of the Bridge’s 
purpose.
“I think people still don’t 
know what Bridge actually 
is, and what Bridge actually 
does,” Park said. Park advo-
cated meeting with organi-
zation leaders to show them 
how to use The Bridge and 
providing online guides on 
Carnegie Mellon’s website. 
Park, a Computing at Carn-
egie Mellon (C@CM) teach-
ing assistant, also suggested 
incorporating The Bridge into 
C@CM’s curriculum.
“I think it’s incredibly es-
sential that students are 
aware of The Bridge and un-
derstand how to use it; it’s 
especially important now that 
a lot of important administra-
tive functions are being done 
through The Bridge,” Khan 
said.
Rockoff agreed that the 
Bridge was severely under-
utilized, mostly because orga-
nization leaders don’t know 
how to use it.
“A lot of the questions 
about The Bridge at present 
are on the ‘where is the but-
ton for’ level; people just don’t 
know how to operate the sys-
tem,” she said. 
To alleviate this issue, 
Rockoff recommends “very 
detailed, but still at the basic 
level, how-to guides—quick 
questions and answers, most 
commonly asked questions.”
“The Bridge is a huge thing 
that’s happening right now 
that works directly with the 
SBVPO; it seems like that’s 
sort of the next step they can 
take to improve the work the 
SBVPO does, because it’s a 
resource that is meant speci?-
cally for organizations on our 
campus,” said MacGillivray, 
who attended the debate.
Andrew Schwartz, a soph-
omore information systems 
major and Student Senate 
sergeant at arms, considered 
what each candidate had to 
offer the position of SBVPO.
“I think Corinne has a 
deeper knowledge of the 
overall student body, and I’m 
not sure how that perspective 
would affect CoSO but I’m in-
terested in ?nding out. I think 
that Radowan has a very deep 
understanding of the way 
CoSO operates, so I think that 
also makes a very interesting 
dynamic.”
Students can vote for can-
didates as well as view their 
submitted platforms online at 
stugov.andrew.cmu.edu un-
til Tuesday. All three debates 
are also available for online 
streaming by cmuTV.
Beta suspended over sex scandal
Nevertheless, in an email 
following Casalegno’s an-
nouncement, Carnegie 
Mellon President Jared Co-
hon expressed that he was 
“shocked and deeply disap-
pointed when [he] learned 
about these allegations.” He 
further stated, “These al-
leged activities are wholly 
inconsistent with our values 
and will not be tolerated.”
Casalegno’s announce-
ment does not come as news 
to some students. Prior to Ca-
salegno’s email on Friday, se-
nior industrial design major 
Maureen Griswold posted, 
“If you don’t know what this 
is referring to, women were 
raped at Beta and evidence 
was found supporting it,” in 
response to an anonymous 
post on the CMU Confessions 
Facebook page about the sus-
pension of the fraternity.
On the anonymous frater-
nity and sorority rating site 
greekrank.com, a user by the 
name of “Shame” posted on 
March 26, saying that Beta 
should “expect criminal al-
legations along the lines of 
sexual assault, and possibly 
distributing sexual content 
involving a minor.”
Casalegno, in an email to 
the student body, urged “any-
one with related concerns or 
questions to speak to [her] or 
to University Police directly.” 
“The concern raised and 
the focus of our investiga-
tion is on the taking and 
sharing of images. We will 
be reaching out to anyone 
whom we believe may have 
any information that would 
be relevant to this investiga-
tion. And, important to note, 
that if ever anyone has infor-
mation about this matter or 
more serious issues related 
to this investigation or oth-
erwise, I urge him or her to 
come forward,” Casalegno 
added.
Neither the national Beta 
Theta Pi fraternity nor Carn-
engie Mellon’s local chapter 
could be reached for com-
ment.
Plagiarism service solicits students
ALVIN MATHEW
Staffwriter
A website called Lash-
zone, which functions as a 
paper mill service, recently 
sent a number of emails 
to Carnegie Mel-
lon students. 
The university 
staff and admin-
istration views 
these emails 
as threats to 
academic 
integri-
ty. They 
also 
coincide 
with the 
university’s 
current at-
tempt to 
update its 
policy on 
academic 
integrity.
Accord-
ing to Lash-
zone’s website, 
the service offers 
“professional assis-
tance on post-second-
ary homework, assignments, 
essays, lab reports, assign-
ment revision...etc.” Students 
wishing to spend money for 
the site’s services would send 
their assignments to the web-
site, prepare for another ma-
jor event like a test during the 
week, and then simply receive 
the requested, completed as-
signment in a reply email be-
fore the due date.
Holly Hippensteel, dean of 
student affairs, notes that al-
though multiple students for-
warded the Lashzone emails, 
“We don’t know how many 
students were contacted.”
Student reaction to the so-
licitation from Lashzone was 
mixed. First-year electrical 
and computer engineering 
major Taimoor Chatoor says 
he wouldn’t do it himself, but 
he doesn’t mind it. “The kids 
don’t learn anything in the 
end — but it’s their choice. Let 
them do what they want,” he 
said.
Alternatively, Je-Hoon Oh, 
a ?rst-year chemistry major, 
had trouble understanding 
why students would par-
take in a paper mill 
program. “Why 
would stu-
dents want 
to copy 
someone 
else’s work, 
especially in 
this age?” Oh 
asked. 
Ox-
ford 
University stu-
dents received 
similar emails in 
January, with student 
responses akin to Oh’s. 
“I wouldn’t use it — my prose 
style is weird and identi?-
able, and I also quite like my 
degree,” one Oxford ?rst-year 
said. “But I fully encourage its 
proliferation on the basis that 
the ‘yoof’ who do use it are 
more likely to get caught. And 
I am basically a pretty spiteful 
person.”
Although it is unknown 
whether Lashzone is truly 
a homework site or just a 
phishing site aimed to scam 
students, students and ad-
ministration have concerns 
about Lashzone. According 
to Hippensteel, “The emails 
were provocative, which got 
our attention. It’s a relatively 
new website, and some feel 
it’s a phishing site while oth-
ers think it’s a homework site. 
But we felt there was enough 
discussion that we decided to 
let faculty know. Lashzone is 
certainly not the only online 
paper mill out there.”
Hippensteel notes that 
Coastal Carolina Univer-
sity has a website 
that keeps track 
of paper mills, 
with over 250 
already 
identi?ed and 
located. She also feels that, 
besides being morally wrong 
to use, sites like Lashzone 
offer a risky proposition for 
students. There is no guaran-
tee — besides the site’s own 
pledge — that it does not copy 
and paste the same answers 
for different students’ assign-
ments, which would be pla-
giarism by de?nition.
“The idea of using a paper 
mill is probably risky in the 
age of Turnitin,” Hippensteel 
said. Turnitin is a plagiarism 
detection and prevention 
website created by iPara-
digms. 
Hippensteel does admit 
that there may be stressed, 
desperate, or lazy students 
who would attempt to use the 
website to their advantage, 
which is a concern.
Hippensteel also notes that 
Carnegie Mellon is looking to 
update its academic integrity 
policy. 
“The current policy was 
last revised in 1990, so it’s 
long overdue. It came out of a 
conversation from faculty sen-
ate, and thanks to students, 
we had a chance to look at the 
policy in March.” The changes 
look to clarify the current pol-
icy and make it clearer.
Currently, the policy focus-
es on the issues of cheating 
and plagiarism. However, 
the major change adopted 
by the new policy would 
be to clearly list “unau-
thorized assistance” — 
such as services offered by 
Lashzone — with the current 
two categories. Although un-
authorized assistance is cur-
rently covered in the current 
policy, the new policy would 
make it clear to students that 
collaboration is not permis-
sible unless students are ex-
plicitly given permission by 
their instructors. Using things 
like cell phones, cheat sheets, 
and outside help would there-
fore not be allowed unless the 
professor permitted.
“It’s about honest commu-
nication,” Hippensteel said. 
“And if you are unsure about 
a professor’s policies, you can 
just ask professors and you’ll 
get an answer. Students can 
also go online and see the 
policy.”
A few hundred students 
already use PayTango, and 
the device has had, accord-
ing to Lau-Kee, “really good 
reception.”
Lau-Kee continued, “Uni-
versities are a great place for 
us, because where we can 
deliver the most value is in 
these very tight ecosystems 
and networks. Here, you use 
one single ID card to pay for 
everything, to get into your 
dorm…. It’s great for us to 
develop the product and 
?ne tune it in a controlled 
setting.”
Lauren Hartman, a ju-
nior communication de-
sign major and cashier at 
the Exchange, said, “There 
have been mixed responses 
to PayTango; most of them 
have been positive. A lot of 
people think it’s really cool, 
other people have been more 
cynical, thinking, ‘Oh, it’s 
kind of big brother-ish.’ It’s 
the control of it, that other 
people might have access to 
their information, how safe 
is it to actually use.”
The PayTango team is 
working to address and 
counter student concerns. 
They are also planning 
to branch into other uni-
versities and venues such as 
gyms, restaurants, and con-
venience stores.
Lau-Kee is the only Pay-
Tango founder still taking 
classes at the Carnegie Mel-
lon Pittsburgh campus. She, 
as well as Groudan, Patel, 
and Reyes, plan to continue 
their development of Pay-
Tango post-graduation.
“Our plans are pretty 
much to run with this as 
far as we can go. The great 
thing is, we’re so young. We 
don’t have as much at stake 
as if, say, we were 30 years 
old. Over the summer we’re 
going to go out to the Valley 
and develop this even fur-
ther,” Lau-Kee said.

Majidi receives award to continue work on soft robotics
LIGIA NISTOR
Staffwriter
Assistant professor of me-
chanical engineering Carmel 
Majidi recently won an award 
from the Air Force Of?ce of 
Scienti?c Research (AFOSR) 
Young Investigator Program. 
The award comes with a 
$360,000 grant that will be 
used in part to fund a Ph.D. 
student working for Majidi in 
the ?eld of soft robotics.
Soft robotics is a new do-
main in robotics where the 
robots are made of soft mate-
rials, as opposed to the types 
of rigid materials that conven-
tional robots are made out of. 
These soft materials include 
elastomers, which are soft 
rubbers that are elastic and 
very stretchable. They can also 
be composed of ?uids or gels.
One of the motivations be-
hind soft robotics is to make 
robots and machines that are 
more life-like than curren ro-
bots. “The idea is that if robots 
and machines are made out of 
soft materials, then they will 
exhibit more of the functional-
ity and properties that natu-
ral organisms have,” Majidi 
said.
According to Majidi, “The 
award addresses a very im-
portant challenge within the 
broader ?eld of soft robotics.” 
Many of these challenges stem 
from the two necessities in 
soft robotics: electric power 
and materials to help power 
these biologically inspired 
robots. In addition, there is 
a need for materials that are 
able to harvest energy from 
their environment. The pur-
pose of the Air Force award is 
to produce new classes of elas-
tomers that can convert elastic 
deformation into electricity. 
When the soft robots move in 
an environment, they undergo 
large elastic deformations and 
collide with the surrounding 
surfaces. Thus they are go-
ing to absorb a lot of elastic 
energy that would otherwise 
be wasted. These robots con-
tain special types of materi-
als and transducers, and they 
can convert that elastic energy 
into electrostatic energy. This 
energy can be used to power 
different electronics inside the 
robot.
Majidi’s lab focuses on cre-
ating the materials that com-
prise soft robots.
One type of material that 
Majidi researches is an elec-
tronic arti?cial skin that would 
go on the outside of the ro-
bots. Inside the skin are sens-
ing elements that can detect 
surface forces: surface fric-
tion, slip events, impact, col-
lision, and contact pressures. 
The electronic skin can act as 
a stretchable type of electronic 
circuit that can go around the 
robot and support some of its 
electrically powered elements.
There are many potential 
application domains for the 
soft robots, such as  the area of 
actuators (arti?cial muscles). 
Some of the technologies that 
Majidi wants to produce in 
terms of energy harvesting 
could potentially be used to 
help power arti?cial muscles 
and soft robot actuators. This 
energy harvesting could also 
be used for producing electric-
ity to power the on-board sen-
sors, electronic switches, and 
different circuit elements in 
the soft robot.
“The ?eld of soft robotics 
is relatively new, but some of 
the underlying principles have 
been around for decades,” 
Majidi said. One paradigm in 
soft robotics is in?atable soft 
robots — these are elastomers 
that are in?ated with com-
pressed air, similar to balloons. 
According to Majidi, there has 
been decades of effort put to-
ward arti?cial muscles based 
on this principle of pneumatic 
in?ation, which uses pressur-
ized gas to in?ate devices. The 
novelty is that there have been 
a lot of advancements in rapid 
prototyping and in the fabri-
cation and advanced manu-
facturing techniques. Now re-
searchers can take the existing 
principles and apply them to 
create much more elaborate 
types of soft robots at different 
length scales.
“Another area that I’m in-
volved with is soft matter elec-
tronics,” Majidi said. “These 
are not necessarily robots, but 
they could function as a robot 
skin.” They could also function 
as wearable electronics, devic-
es that can be put on human 
skin. These are thin sheets of 
soft rubber embedded with 
micro?uidic channels of dif-
ferent types of ?uidic mat-
ters. A lot of the current work 
in Majidi’s lab is focused on 
that approach to stretchable 
electronics. “That also moti-
vates a lot of the work in this 
Air Force award — which is to 
create electrostatic generators 
to help power the soft matter 
electronics and sensors,” Ma-
jidi said.
“I’m very grateful for the 
award and I’m very excited by 
this research,” Majidi conclud-
ed. “It’s great for the group 
and for the Carnegie Mellon 
community because it creates 
this opportunity to do cutting-
edge research.”
BROOKE KUEI
Assistant SciTech Editor
Bees are a lot smarter than 
most people credit them. How 
do bees know where to ?nd 
the best ?owers? When they 
?nd these ?owers, how do 
they tell other bees where they 
are? These are tasks that may 
appear trivial at ?rst glance, 
but actually involve complex 
and miraculous processes.
Howstuffworks.com ex-
plains that bees use two main 
tools in their search for food: 
a solar compass and an inter-
nal clock. Bees use their so-
lar compass to remember the 
location of objects relative to 
the sun. Since they are able 
to see polarized light, their 
solar compass is unaffected 
by whether it is a sunny or 
cloudy day. The second tool, 
a bee’s internal clock, keeps 
track of how long the bee has 
been searching for food.
What is amazing about 
the combination of these 
abilities is that bees are even 
aware of how the sun moves 
throughout the time that they 
are searching for food. This 
means that when the bee re-
turns to its hive, it can tell its 
hive mates exactly where the 
food is relative to the current 
position of the sun — not just 
relative to where the sun was 
when it found the food.
LiveScience describes a new 
theory regarding how bees de-
tect ?owers: Most plants have 
a slight negative charge rela-
tive to the air around them, 
while ?ying bees have a posi-
tive charge. Wired explains 
the positive charge of bees by 
using the analogy of wings ac-
cumulating charge as they zip 
through the air the same way 
that electrical charge accu-
mulates on a person shuf?ing 
across a carpet.
To test whether these op-
posite charges help bees lo-
cate ?owers, researchers used 
arti?cial ?owers, half of which 
were electrically charged and 
?lled with sweet nectar, the 
other half of which had no 
charge and were ?lled with a 
bitter solution. As expected, 
the bees quickly learned that 
the good food could be found 
in the electrically charged 
sweet ?owers.
But the real test came when 
the researchers switched off 
the electrical charges. When 
none of the ?owers was elec-
trically charged, the bees 
simply visited the ?owers ran-
domly. The results of this ex-
periment suggest that bees do 
indeed use the electric charge 
of plants to ?nd nectar-rich 
?owers. What’s more, biolo-
gists discovered that ?owers 
that have already had their 
nectar harvested become 
more positively charged. This 
way, bees know not to waste 
their time visiting ?owers that 
no longer have much nectar.
After locating where nec-
tar-?lled ?owers are, bees 
need to communicate to their 
fellow hive mates where they 
are. Howstuffworks.com ex-
plains that if the food is close 
to the hive, the bee will per-
form a round dance. This type 
of dance consists of traveling 
in loops in alternating direc-
tions. The round dance does 
not point in the direction of 
the food, it merely tells the 
other bees that food is near-
by. When food is close, the 
other bees can usually ?nd it 
on their own simply by using 
their odor senses.
A more complicated dance, 
which is performed when 
food is far away, is called the 
waggle dance. The waggle 
dance consists of ?ying in a 
straight line followed by re-
turning loops. The direction of 
the straight line indicates the 
direction of the food in rela-
tion to the sun. 
For example, if the bee 
runs straight up the hive 
walls, this means that the food 
can be found by ?ying toward 
the sun. Conversely, if the bee 
runs straight down the hive 
wall, the food can be found 
by flying away from the sun. 
The quality of the ?owers are 
indicated by the speed of the 
returning loops.
The most important part 
of the waggle dance is the 
waggle run. As the bee ?ies 
its straight line and returning 
loops, it vibrates its wings and 
waggles its abdomen. By do-
ing so, the bee moves the air 
around it, allowing other bees 
near it to learn the location of

movement.
Bees are not to be taken 
as mere insects — with solar 
compasses, internal clocks, 
electrical attraction to plants, 
and intricate dances, they are 
a highly ef?cient and coopera-

communicate in astonishing 
ways.
Human – Neanderthal hybrid identi?ed
Skeletal remains found in 
Riparo di Mezzena, a rock-
shelter in northern Italy, may 
belong to the ?rst known 
human-Neanderthal hybrid. 
Current studies focus on 
analyzing the jaw structure, 
which differs drastically be-
tween Neanderthals and 
modern humans. The struc-
ture of this jaw was a blend 
between a Neanderthal’s 
receding lower jaw and a 
modern human’s prominent 
lower jaw. The genetic analy-
sis revealed that the remains 
contained mitochondrial 
DNA of a Neanderthal, sug-
gesting that the individual 
would have been the descen-
dant of a female Neanderthal 
and a male Homo sapien. 
This study indicates possible 
“ethnic cleansing” of the Ne-
anderthals by sexual assault. 
Further research will reveal 
more information about Ne-
anderthal and human inter-
actions.

Robot ants simulate colony behavior
Researchers based at the 
New Jersey Institute of Tech-
nology and the Research 
Centre on Animal Cognition 
built sugar cube-sized robots, 
known as “Alices,” that mim-
ic the behavior of Argentine 
ants. The study was focused 
on their pathway coordina-
tion. The robots leave light 
trails and use light sensors 
to trace the trails, mimick-
ing the pheromone trails and 
antennae of real ants. When 
no light trail is available, the 
robots follow random direc-
tions, which correspond to 
the near-blind Argentine 
ant’s behavior in the absence 
of pheromone trails. The 
researchers found that the 
light-following algorithms 
and the random walking sim-
ulations were suf?cient for 
guiding the ants to their des-
tination. This ?nding indi-
cates that ef?cient navigation 
is possible even with the ants’ 
minimal cognitive abilities 
and geometric consideration.

Shortcut to International  Space Station
Last Thursday, two Rus-
sian cosmonauts and a NASA 
astronaut arrived at the In-
ternational Space Station a 
mere ?ve hours and 45 min-
utes after their launch from 
the Baikonur Cosmodrome 
in Kazakhstan. This express 
route resulted in a trip that 
was about 45 hours shorter 
than the traditional trips. 
Before this trip, the Russians 
had been exploring alternate 
routes over the past three 
years. 
This express route was 
tested during three un-
manned cargo ?ights. The 
expedited route involves very 
precise steering and calcula-
tions, making space debris 
and any other potential prob-
lems even more threatening. 
The abridged travel time also 
allows astronauts to arrive 
at the space station before 
the onset of microgravity-
induced sickness.

Biological indications of criminal recidivism
The Mind Research Net-
work in Albuquerque, New 
Mexico completed a study 
demonstrating that neuroim-
aging techniques can predict 
the likelihood of criminal re-
cidivism after being released 
from prison. The study exam-
ined impulsive and antisocial 
behavior focused in the ante-
rior cingulate cortex (ACC), 
the brain’s regulatory center 
for behavior and impulsiv-
ity. It was determined that 
inmates with low ACC activ-
ity were twice as likely to 
reoffend than inmates with 
high ACC activity. People 
with damaged or inactive 
ACCs tend to have “changes 
in disinhibition, apathy, and 
aggressiveness” and are typi-
cally identi?ed by “acquired 
psychopathic personality,” 
the study states.

The energy climate of the 
nation, and especially south-
west Pennsylvania, was been 
transformed by the discovery 
of the Marcellus Shale. The 
fracking boom has been a 
source of controversy, and has 
brought up many important 
questions regarding the econo-
my, the environment, and pol-
icy. Recently, researchers from 
Carnegie Mellon have traveled 
to Washington, D.C. to speak 
with policymakers and share 
their recently completed 30-
page policy guide on shale gas.
The team that traveled 
to Washington included en-
gineering and public policy 
professor of the work and as-
sistant director of policy out-
reach for the Scott Institute 
Deborah Stine, civil and envi-
ronmental engineering profes-
sor Jeanne VanBriesen, associ-
ate professor of engineering 
and public policy and profes-
sor in the Tepper School of 
Business Michael Grif?n, head 
of the mechanical engineering 
department Allen Robinson, 
and Ph.D. student in engineer-
ing and public policy Austin 
Mitchell. All are also associ-
ated with Carnegie Mellon’s 
Scott Institute for Energy In-
novation, which was launched 
last September.
The team’s main goal in 
Washington was to give poli-
cymakers and members of 
government a primer on shale 
gas, and inform them of the 
current research that was oc-
curring at Carnegie Mellon in 
regards to water resources, air 
pollution, and gas wells. The 
group also focused their atten-
tion on pushing for a research 
initiative between universities, 
government, and industry.
The researchers stressed 
that there are many problems 
on how research is currently 
done in shale gas. According to 
Stine, many academic institu-
tions are working on a “shoe- 
string budget,” with very little 
funds available when it comes 
to shale gas research. Mitchell 
also notes that research con-
ducted by the gas industry can 
sometimes draw skepticism.
“There’s always that ques-
tion of ‘well, is the work bi-
ased?’ and even if the work is 
good, it’s tough to avoid those 
sorts of questions. If somebody 
from the environmental group 
pays for the work, then you 
have the opposite occurring,” 
he said.
Enter the university-gov-
ernment-industry research ini-
tiative. The team believes that 
this collaboration between the 
different parties will result in 
better energy research with 
better solutions. Stine believes 
this setup would allow an in-
dependent board to prioritize 
research funds, and reduce 
the redundancy that is cur-
rently occurring in shale gas 
research. Mitchell also stresses 
the need for communication 
across institutions.
“What we’ve experienced 
is all these different people 
need to come together to sup-
port this initiative and to sup-
port research and understand 
what basically is going to be a 
huge part of the energy land-
scape of what’s to come,” he 
said. “That is something that 
we collectively believe is nec-
essary to set a new agenda for 
conducting research in this 
area. I think it can allow us to 
maximize the bene?ts of shale 
gas but also understand and 
minimize the costs.”
In Washington, the group  
members met with representa-
tives from the Obama adminis-
tration, members of the Senate 
and House of Representatives, 
and representatives from the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) to discuss their 
policy guide and give their 
pitch for the research initia-
tive.
According to Mitchell and 
Stine, the trip seemed to be 
a success. “I think it was very 
successful. We got very little 
negative feedback,” Stine said. 
According to Mitchell, ev-
eryone they met was informed 
and receptive to their ideas. “I 
think we did a really great job 
communicating our research 
and community the need for 
this initiative,” he said.
There were, however, 
questions of concern regard-
ing how this initiative would 
be implemented, who would 
pay for it, and what speci?c 
processes would need to take 
place. According to Mitchell, 
currently all of the budget al-
lotted for shale gas research 
goes to government organiza-
tions such as the EPA and the 
Department of Energy.
To Stine and Mitchell, this 
trip to Washington was just 
the beginning. Moving for-
ward, the Scott Institute will 
continue to publish about 
three to four of these policy 
guides a year, according to 
Stine. In May, a similar group 
within the institute will travel 
to Washington, D.C. to brief 
policymakers on renewable 
energy resources. With shale 
gas estimated to account for 
almost half of the natural gas 
supply in the United States by 
2040, the researchers in the 
Scott Institute hope to impact 
policy as soon as possible.

Engineers push for collaboration on shale gas research
An overview of shale gas:
•	Shale gas production is increasing rapidly and is expected to become half of the U.S.      
natural gas supply by 2040. 
•	Shale gas is trapped within shale formations, which is fine-grained sedimentary rock. 
It used to be very costly to extract this gas, but advances in horizontal drilling and hy-
draulic fracturing have now made it more economical. Shale gas is extracted through a               
combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. 
The costs and benefits of shale gas drilling:
Pros:
•	Economic: potential of long-term job creation and lower energy prices
•	National security: the U.S. will only be reliant on North American energy supplies 
•	Environmental: displaces sources such as coal and oil
Cons:
•	Environmental: shale gas extraction process can affect ground and surface water                    
resources if performed incorrectly; shale gas production has air pollution emissions
An argument for a government-university-industry research initiative:
•	Carnegie Mellon proposes a government-university-industry initiative “to fill critical 
gaps in knowledge at the interface of shale gas development and environmental pro-
tection so the nation can better prepare for its energy future.”
•	The initiative would reduce redundency in shale gas research and provide a firewall     
between the priorities of research. The team believes that collaborative research may 
appear more trustworthy than that funded only by industry or government.
•	The initiative would provide an easier system for policymaking by streamlining                            
information and communications.

Midway Market removal neglectful of organizations
Incentives for student leaders should be considered
Activists protesting organ har-
vesting in China, as well as activists 
from the Human Rights Campaign, 
have begun regularly appearing on 
campus this past week. 
In particular, the issue of alleged 
organ harvesting in China is both 
incredibly important to discuss and 
deeply complex. 
However, perhaps the meth-
ods activists are employing to 
bring attention to this issue could 
be re-evaluated.
One of the activists’ most com-
mon locations is the main entrance 
to campus — the ?rst step on the 
stairs facing Forbes Avenue. This po-
sition requires most students to pass 
them on the way to class. 
While this minor inconvenience is 
not a huge issue, it discourages stu-
dents from being receptive or active 
listeners. If a student is running late 
to class, stopping to talk to a person 
with a ?yer can seem trivial and ir-
relevant.
The other major problem with the 
activists’ campaign is the actual con-
tent of their ?yers. The content bor-
ders on sensationalism in its attempt 
to raise awareness. For example, the 
front page of the organ harvesting 
protesters’ handout depicts a little 
girl in the rain holding a sign that 
reads “Killed for their belief.”
 Furthermore, the content of the 
?yer — speci?cally the explanation 
of Falun Gong — serves as an at-
tempt to sway religious beliefs.
Page six of the packet has an in-
depth description of the faith, as well 
as several charts depicting health 
bene?ts for practitioners, as “many 
people just like you take up the prac-
tice of Falun Gong and experience 
health bene?ts.” This attempt at con-
version is so obviously partisan that 
it detracts from the overall issue at 
hand.
Public activism always has its is-
sues — people are often too busy to 
connect with activists, even for ex-
tremely important causes. Because 
of these dif?culties, organizations 
choosing to promote their causes 
on campus must strike a balance 
between enthusiasm for their cause 
and respect for the busy schedules 
and various beliefs of students who 
pass them on their way to classes.
In 2011, Spring Carnival Com-
mittee erected a tent known as Mid-
way Market on Carnival’s Midway 
in Morewood parking lot. As part 
of a two-year experiment, Midway 
Market served as a location where 
organizations without booths could 
interact with students, alumni, and 
other guests.
However, Midway Market will 
be absent from this year’s Carni-
val celebration.
While the Midway Market tent 
lacks the ?air of the booths, an op-
tion for promotion should be made 
available to smaller organizations 
that are unable to participate in 
booth building.
Spring Carnival embraces every 
aspect of Carnegie Mellon’s unique 
campus culture, and the event must 
continue to represent every part of 
this culture by remaining inclusive 
to all parties involved. While most 
large organizations on campus — 
particularly Greek chapters — have 
the manpower and resources to 
build booths, smaller organizations 
are unable to do so, largely due to 
the limited membership. Midway 
Market provides a way for smaller 
organizations to promote themselves 
during Carnegie Mellon’s annual cel-
ebration.
Spring Carnival is also a celebra-
tion of students’ accomplishments. 
From booth to buggy to Mobot, 
Carnival has always been a way for 
students to show off to those both 
within and outside the campus com-
munity. This opportunity must re-
main extended to all organizations 
and individuals hoping to show off 
their accomplishments.
The Spring Carnival Committee 
must work with organizations to cre-
ate an alternative resource or loca-
tion for the Midway Market tent. Al-
though Spring Carnival Committee 
deemed Midway Market a two-year 
experiment, the committee should 
make an efforts to reach out to orga-
nizations affected by the loss of their 
Carnival venue.
The committee has made clear ef-
forts in the past to represent all or-
ganizations, as is apparent by their 
decision to create Midway Market in 
the ?rst place. 
While these efforts are commend-
able, it is imperative that they are 
continued, not abandoned, in the 
coming years.

This year’s student body election 
for student body vice president for 
?nance (SBVPF) features a 100 per-
cent increase in candidates: from 
one to two. 
In the last election, senior light-
ing design major Jon Mark ran un-
opposed, and while he has done a 
commendable job as the SBVPF, it 
is clearly in the campus’ best inter-
est that more than one or two can-
didates run for these important stu-
dent body positions.
As the of?cial student govern-
ment website describes, the student 
body vice president for ?nance is 
“the ?nancial representative for the 
entire undergraduate and gradu-
ate student population at Carnegie 
Mellon.” The SBVPF has extremely 
important duties that dictate the 
operation of many crucial student 
organizations and activities —  du-
ties that are too important for a can-
didate to win by default. This apathy 
toward crucial student positions also 
applies to more than just the student 
body vice president for ?nance; the 
competition for student body presi-
dent is just two tickets this year.
The key to ?xing this problem 
lies with discernible incentives. The 
heads of student organizations put 
an extraordinary amount of time to 
ensure that our campus functions as 
it should, and this monumental time 
commitment likely deters many po-
tential candidates. 
A system of incentives could at-
tract quali?ed and dedicated candi-
dates to help run our campus orga-
nizations and government, and keep 
our campus community performing 
at its best. 
While options for incentives are 
plentiful, one incentive could be 
payment for serving in positions of 
leadership. After all, the SBVPF’s as-
sistant is paid while the SBVPF goes 
unpaid. Payment could motivate stu-
dents currently compensated for a 
position to move to higher positions 
that are currently unpaid.
Another incentive could be units. 
After all, many of the skills that stu-
dents learn through leadership po-
sitions are also taught in the class-
room, including handling ?nances, 
drafting proposals, and presenting 
plans of action to others on campus.
Many quali?ed candidates hesi-
tate to run for important positions 
around campus, due to the time 
commitment of the job. 
A system of incentives alone 
would not remedy this problem, but 
it could help motivate many of these 
individuals to take a greater role in 
our campus community, and reward 
those who are already devoting a 
great deal of their time toward cam-
pus activities. 
Activists should be respectful of university members
Online activism does not produce lasting change
Internet activists capable of getting the word out
SATVIKA NETI
Unless you don’t use Facebook, 
or you have been living under a rock 
for the past week, you have probably 
seen in your news feed that many 
pro?le pictures are now equal signs.
Internet social activism is a grow-
ing trend that you can advocate with 
the press of a button — and it keeps 
hitting social media users with dif-
ferent campaigns. The most recent 
one before the current campaign for 
marriage equality was Kony 2012.
Obviously, there are many criti-
cisms to this kind of activism, the 
most germane being that it doesn’t 
do anything to further a cause. Lik-
ing a Facebook post and changing 
your pro?le picture does not help 
the Supreme Court decide anything 
in the coming months, just as chang-
ing your pro?le picture to feature 
Kony last April did not end up really 
helping the people of Uganda.
But the silver lining to this — the 
good side to what is almost affec-
tionately called slacktivism, a com-
bination of  “slacker” and “activism”, 
— is that it gets the word out.
Internet activism makes people 
aware of issues and can inform oth-
ers about the issue. People who had 
no idea about Kony but were truly 
interested could do research and 
help provide the Ugandans with 
supplies they needed. On the other 
hand, even if those people did not 
end up giving to the cause, at least 
they were educated about the issue 
from seeing the mass of changed 
pro?le pictures.
Regarding marriage equality, the 
changed pro?le pictures, the Human 
Rights Campaign’s logo, creates kin-
ship against the wave of opposition 
to the repeals of Proposition 8 and 
DOMA. While there are issues of 
making the campaign an “Allies” 
?ght as opposed to LGBTQ individu-
als addressing their own con?ict, 
seeing the mass of equal signs would 
surely comfort someone struggling 
with his or her sexual identity.
Research also shows that slack-
tivists are not necessarily slackers. 
A 2010 survey by TNS Global sug-
gests Internet slacktivists are just 
as likely to donate their money to a 
cause as non-slacktivists, and even 
twice as likely to volunteer. They are 
also more likely to recruit people to 
a cause, request donations, and sign 
petitions that end up changing poli-
ticians’ positions. The bottom line is 
that people’s activities are not de-
?ned by their online activity.
Even if it might not be the best 
way to help win any legal or ?nan-
cial battles, slacktivism can be a key 
to garnering support and promoting 
discussions of controversial issues.
This type of activism helps ?ght 
the social battles — and win them.

Last week, the Supreme Court 
considered the constitutionality of 
Proposition 8 and the Defense of 
Marriage Act (DOMA). Proposition 
8 bans gay marriage in California, 
while DOMA denies federal mar-
riage bene?ts to those in same-sex 
marriages. Inspired by the Human 
Rights Campaign, an organization 
working for LGBTQ rights, many 
Facebook users changed their pro-
?le pictures to a pink equal sign 
against a red background in support 
of marriage equality.
While support for gay marriage is 
admirable, Internet activism doesn’t 
result in true change when it comes 
to controversial issues. If they want 
success, social media campaigns 
must focus on getting people out 
from behind their computer screens.
Currently, social media is un-
able to motivate users to create last-
ing change. According to Malcom 
Gladwell, a staffwriter for The New 
Yorker, social media creates weak 
ties, “[which] seldom lead to high-
risk activism.” Strong relationships 
promote action, but these connec-
tions are hard to build online.
While changing a picture or lik-
ing a campaign page on Facebook 
raises awareness of national and 
global issues, it does little to cre-
ate tangible bene?ts for those in 
need. Gladwell notes that each of 
the 1,282,339 members of the Save 
Darfur Coalition’s Facebook page on 
average only donates $0.09. These 
contributions amount to a mere do-
nation of approximately $115,410. 
This meager donation from well 
over 1 million people for a war-torn 
region shows that, while social me-
dia can garner support for a cause, it 
is unable to motivate people to take 
action.
Additionally, Michigan State 
University research assistant Jessica 
Vitak found in a study that the more 
intensely people use Facebook, the 
less likely they are to participate in 
other forms of political activism. 
While she found that they may be 
in?uenced by others’ posts, people 
are less likely to promote change 
in public the more they promote 
change from their own computer.
In order to promote real change 
through social media, campaigns 
need to reinvent how they advertise. 
Those hoping to promote change 
must do more than ask others to like 
their photo on Facebook or share 
their link, which only raises aware-
ness. While awareness is valuable 
to any campaign, people aiming to 
promote change should focus on 
tangible ways that people can help 
outside the realm of social media. 
Their descriptions of issues should 
not focus on sharing or liking a post. 
Instead, leaders of a cause should 
include ways in which people can 
publicly address an issue in their 
community or nation.
The Supreme Court may rule 
that legislation like DOMA and 
Proposition 8 are unconstitutional, 
but these decisions won't be made 
because of changed pro?le pictures. 
They will be in?uenced by the tes-
timonies of those brave enough to 
present their cases and those who 
leave their computer screens to pro-
test in public.

A PERSON’S OPINION
April 1, 2013 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » B7
Compiled by Jonathan Leung
The Tartan is feeling a bit adventurous. So we asked,
What’s your favorite off-campus location to visit in your free time?
KYLE HENSON
Proposition 8, California’s ban 
on gay marriage, and the Defense 
of Marriage Act (DOMA) which pre-
vents same sex marriages from being 
recognized at the Federal level, went 
before the Supreme Court last week. 
The court has several options regard-
ing these two laws, but it should dis-
miss the Proposition 8 case on proce-
dural grounds and overturn DOMA 
in the name of states’ rights.
Potential rulings on Proposi-
tion 8 could be wide and varied. It 
could strike the amendment for just 
California because the California 
Supreme Court ruled a gay marriage 
ban unconstitutional. This decision 
would be considered a narrow rul-
ing. The court could also say that any 
state ban on gay marriage is uncon-
stitutional and strike it down for the 
country, similar to Roe v. Wade. This 
would be considered a broad ruling. 
Additionally, the court could dismiss 
the Proposition 8 case altogether, 
saying that to continue a lawsuit, 
you must have been harmed in some 
way, and the supporters of Proposi-
tion 8 have not been harmed by gay 
marriage. The court could also de-
clare that civil unions and marriage 
are the same thing, which would 
have very unclear implications.
If the court takes a broad ruling, 
it would give the Federal govern-
ment police power — the power to 
regulate people, not as consumers, 
income-earners, or smokers, but as 
human beings living, breathing, and 
trying to get married. This power is 
reserved for the states.
If the court takes a narrow ruling, 
it would respect states rights and 
police power, but only overturn Cali-
fornia’s gay marriage ban. But there 
is no need to. The court should not 
only respect states rights and police 
power, but also preserve everyone’s 
freedom to marry by dismissing the 
case on the grounds that those suing 
have no reason to be in court.
In all seriousness, if someone’s 
gay neighbors get married, he or she 
is no worse off. Gay people already 
live together. It really doesn’t affect 
anyone else if they’re granted the le-
gal rights of marriage.
When someone sues the Federal 
government, it’s because he or she 
was hurt or otherwise damaged. 
When the gay couples suing the gov-
ernment won their case in California 
court, the damages done to them 
were repaired. They were allowed to 
marry. They didn’t appeal the case. 
The case is in Federal court now be-
cause the supporters of Proposition 
8 continued the case. They have no 
right to be in court because they 
were not damaged.
If the case is dismissed, then gay 
marriage remains a state decision — 
as it should be — and gay couples in 
California get to marry. More impor-
tantly, this decision legally recogniz-
es that gay marriage has no negative 
externalities, and nicely slaps the 
faces of Proposition 8 supporters by 
telling them that their position is so 
invalid that the court won’t consider 
their arguments.
The DOMA case is simpler. Gay 
marriage is a state issue. Conser-
vative justices must limit Federal 
power by saying that the Federal 
government can't invalidate state 
police power in recognizing marriag-
es. I believe that the liberal justices 
will cast four votes for overturning 
DOMA and Chief Justice John Rob-
erts and Associate Justice Antho-
ny Kennedy will join them on the 
grounds of Federalism.
Interestingly enough, Section 2 of 
DOMA isn’t being challenged. This 
section says that states don’t have 
to recognize gay marriages made in 
other states. This ?agrantly violates 
the Full Faith and Credit Clause of 
the Constitution (Article IV, Sec-
tion 1), which states that laws made 
in one state have to be respected in 
another. Why this isn’t being chal-
lenged in court is a mystery — it’d be 
a very quick way to repeal DOMA.
The court is likely to overturn 
DOMA and to at least recognize gay 
couples’ rights to marry in California 
by taking either a narrow ruling or 
dismissing the case altogether. Ei-
ther way, it’s a win for gay marriage 
and a win for limited government 
and states’ rights.

If I had a dollar for every intern-
ship opportunity that had everything 
I was looking for until the ?ne print 
of “unpaid, academic credit avail-
able” — why, I'd probably be able to 
afford to take the job.
As a professional writing and Eng-
lish double major, I have never had 
a paid internship. My work, in and 
out of school, has never been paid. 
When comparing summer plans with 
my peers — coming from a variety of 
majors, mostly in the technical ?elds 
— their reactions are always the 
same: “Don't take the job, then! Hold 
out for someone who'll pay you. Isn't 
that technically slave labor?” And, 
unsurprisingly, my answer is always 
the same: “There are no paid, ful?ll-
ing jobs for me to take, especially in 
this economy.”
I may be biased, but I believe the 
problem of unpaid internships exists 
almost entirely in humanities ?elds. 
I have never witnessed a computer 
scientist forced to choose between 
a fantastic, experience-boosting un-
paid internship and a boring, unre-
lated internship that pays them well. 
But this scenario is something my 
friends in the humanities must deal 
with. Internships rarely allow hu-
manities students to have it all.
That ?ne print in internship ads 
can be a death sentence, particularly 
for those not from af?uent families. 
Money always comes ?rst; you can't 
pay rent with all the “experience” 
you get from an unpaid internship.
It's unrealistic for companies to 
think that their interns will be di-
verse when so many candidates don't 
apply simply because they can't af-
ford it. Even more insulting is when 
companies offer a minuscule stipend 
below minimum wage, thinking that 
it will put them morally ahead of 
those that don't pay at all.
However, my main problem with 
unpaid internships is how perva-
sive they are within the humanities. 
The ?eld is already the butt of many 
jokes — especially at Carnegie Mel-
lon — so why add more problems 
for its students to deal with? When it 
already feels like your major is being 
questioned 24 hours a day, not hav-
ing a company validate your skills 
with a paycheck is depressing.
To illustrate, during my search for 
jobs post-graduation, I ?lled out a  
careerbuilder.com pro?le and signed 
up for email updates on jobs that 
matched my résumé and skill set.
The potential jobs I was matched 
up with? Of?ce assistant, of?ce man-
ager, and secretary.
Out of hundreds of jobs on 
careerbuilder.com, the site couldn't 
?nd a single paying job that remote-
ly matched my interests. Sure, the 
results might just lie with how the 
website’s algorithm works, but it’s 
insulting nonetheless. Meanwhile, 
when I widened my search to include 
internships, the world seemed to 
open up and I found plenty of unpaid 
opportunities waiting for me to take 
advantage of.
For me, the reasoning behind 
this situation seems to be simple. To 
companies, my skills are not worth 
paying for compared to those of my 
technically-minded peers. After all, 
the companies already believe they 
are going out of their way to so gen-
erously give me “experience”; how 
dare I ask for anything more?
To a degree, tech companies are 
able to pay interns because of how 
the economy currently works. But 
that does not excuse the historical 
precedent of the rampant unpaid in-
ternships for humanities students.
I spent the last four years hon-
ing my skills, trying to be a jack of 
all trades so I could become an irre-
placeable asset who deserves to be 
paid. I can do more than just read and 
write — I can think critically, work 
in groups, lead teams, write persua-
sively using time-honored rhetorical 
techniques, evaluate what audiences 
want, translate complicated jargon 
into coherent and concise pieces, 
and use a plethora of software to cre-
ate aesthetically pleasing designs, 
just to name a few of my skills.
These are the kinds of abilities 
that will help keep a company a?oat 
— no matter its ?eld. Successful 
companies balance both technical 
skills and communication skills.
But unpaid internships have be-
come ingrained in society. Humani-
ties students are willing to work for 
free because companies do not value 
their skills. And so, the vicious cycle 
began when students were grateful 
simply to land internships — no mat-
ter the cost — and companies real-
ized how much they could get away 
with when hiring interns.
There is no clear solution to this is-
sue. However, the solution will have 
to start with how society views the 
humanities and the value it places on 
the skills taught in the ?eld.

My preparation for the interview 
to study abroad seemed perfect. The 
opportunity to leave RWTH Aachen 
University, Germany for Carnegie 
Mellon sounded like the opportu-
nity to travel to a better place.
When I found myself being as-
sessed on my capacity to represent 
my home university abroad, I dis-
played my enthusiasm for Carnegie 
Mellon, a place I read about in Ran-
dy Pausch’s The Last Lecture. There 
was, however, one question that I 
had not seen coming:
“As an ambassador for our uni-
versity, what is it that you would tell 
an American in order to make him 
come here for a year?”
At the time, Carnegie Mellon 
seemed to be an escape from a place 
whose strengths I did not yet recog-
nize. There are several ?aws of my 
university and the approach it takes 
to educating future engineers.
With four to ?ve courses each 
semester, the workload in Germany  
— particularly having problem set 
after problem set thrown at me — 
was frustrating. Instead of fostering 
interests in a speci?c subject, the 
weekly workload made it impossible 
to further research a topic presented 
in class. My expectations of a schol-
arly life full of captivating insights 
were not met. Quite the opposite, 
at no point did the university ap-
pear to care about its students, with 
the most dif?cult subjects like ther-
modynamics yielding 40 percent 
fail rates. Achieving a C+ or B- on 
an exam was often considered an 
above-average performance.
I also did not see myself thriving 
in an environment with large class 
sizes and little space to study, both 
due to funding. Even though RWTH 
Aachen is funded more adequately 
than any other university in Ger-
many, according to Financial Times 
Duetschland, our “?rst-year experi-
ence” in engineering is sitting in a 
gigantic lecture hall with over 1,000 
students. During my ?rst year, I had 
trouble coping with the fact that I 
seemed to have turned from an in-
dividual into a mere number. I could 
not help but feel that my institution 
would not notice if I dropped out.
Finding study locations during 
the most intense periods of the se-
mester became an art itself. A long 
queue of students waiting outside 
the library at 8 a.m. was a common 
observation.
This lack of funding hurt the un-
dergraduate experience, as it made 
individual lab experiences impossi-
ble and it impinged on lectures. Mal-
functioning microphones in the lec-
ture halls of Germany’s top technical 
university are expected. Despite the 
university of?cials’ promise to make 
lecture hall equipment re?ect the 
high standards of RWTH, the im-
plementation of these changes are 
slow. If installing a new microphone 
is economically unfeasible, how can 
one even hope for a more practical 
lab experience that utilizes expen-
sive equipment?
Professors also often have lim-
ited availability. The conversations 
I have had with professors always 
inspired me — reason enough to 
fantasize about how great close col-
laboration between students and 
professors would be. While teaching 
assistants were available to speak 
multiple times a week, professors 
were not often available because 
they rarely have set of?ce hours. One 
of the reasons for that is the role of 
professors at a lot of German univer-
sities. Rather than being heavily in-
volved in research themselves, pro-
fessors act as managers who de?ne 
the pathway that research in their 
department should take. Therefore, 
their connection to undergraduate 
students is often limited to the lec-
tures that they give.
Because of these aspects, Carn-
egie Mellon embodied the “Prom-
ised Land” in terms of education. 
I dreamed of small classrooms, 
fair grading, and problem sets that 
taught meaningful material. In 
America, there would be professors 
with regular of?ce hours, available 
computer clusters, and grades that 
re?ected the work put into courses.
My hope was that combining 
experiences from German and U.S. 
universities would help students be-
come better engineers.
 While my experiences at Carn-
egie Mellon have allowed me to re-
alize my home education system’s 
?aws, they have also allowed me to 
identify its strengths, which I will 
talk about in my next article.
This article is the ?rst in a series of ar-
ticles detailing the realizations of an 
exchange student at Carnegie Mellon.

Baseball’s opening night 
game last Sunday between 
new American League (AL) 
West opponents, the Texas 
Rangers and the Houston As-
tros, began a season that will 
introduce one of the most 
sweeping changes in Major 
League Baseball. The season 
will also hopefully see the 
Pittsburgh Pirates achieve 
their ?rst winning season 
since 1992.
The most notable of these 
changes is the Astros’ move 
from the once-six-team Na-
tional League (NL) Central to 
the previously four-team AL 
West in an effort to balance 
the divisions and to give teams 
a more even ?eld in which to 
win their division and guaran-
tee a playoff spot.
With this move, the AL 
and NL are now balanced at 
15 teams apiece, forcing In-
terleague play to shift from 
a three- to four-week novelty 
during May and June to a year-
round necessity.
The Pirates and the rest 
of the NL Central should be 
relieved that their six-team 
divisional logjam is ?nally 
remedied, even if it means 
removing the pitiful Astros. 
Unfortunately for the Pirates, 
the division is still stacked, 
and they face an uphill battle 
to ?nally posting a winning 
season.
Let’s look at each team in 
the NL Central, breaking down 
off-season moves, strengths 
and weaknesses, as well as 
predicting how they will ?nish 
come September.
First Place 
Cincinnati Reds
The Reds ?nished last sea-
son in ?rst place with a devas-
tating offense and a lights-out 
pitching staff. Even though 
they ?nished last year with 
the second-most wins in base-
ball, the Reds were still active 
this off-season, trading center 
?elder Drew Stubbs for right 
?elder Shin-Soo Choo from 
the Cleveland Indians in a 
three-team deal. While some 
people question this move 
from a defensive standpoint 
— Choo has never played cen-
ter ?elder in his major league 
career — the offensive impact 
is quite apparent. Choo ?lls 
the large hole at their lead-off 
spot and turns the already po-
tent Cincinnati lineup into one 
of the best in the league.
Second Place 
St. Louis Cardinals
The Cardinals seem un-
fazed by any loss of talent. 
Each year, several key play-
ers suffer injuries, and yet St. 
Louis keeps winning. This year 
is no different, with ace Chris 
Carpenter and starting short-
stop Rafael Furcal already lost 
to season ending injuries.
All that being said, the 
Cardinals have one of the best 
farm systems and have several 
minor league players who are 
expected to contribute this 
year, including out?elder Os-
car Taveras who will start the 
year in the minors, and three 
young pitchers starting in the 
majors — Trevor Rosenthal, 
Shelby Miller, and Joe Kelly.
Third Place 
Pittsburgh Pirates
After a close call last year, 
this should be the year that 
the Pirates have their ?rst win-
ning season in over 20 years. 
All-Star Andrew McCutchen 
is fresh off his best season 
and still has room to grow. 
Catcher Russell Martin made 
waves in the off-season by 
turning down a contract to re-
main with New York Yankees 
and instead signing with the 
Pirates. Hopefully this in?ux 
of leadership, in addition to 
the continued improvement 
of McCutchen, slugging third 
baseman Pedro Alvarez, and 
former All-Star Gaby Sánchez, 
will help the Pirates avoid 
the late-season slumps that 
plagued the team the past two 
seasons.
Fourth Place 
Milwaukee Brewers
Even after losing slugging 
?rst baseman Prince Fielder 
last offseason, hitting the 
ball was never the Brewers’ 
main issue after leading the 
league in runs and home runs 
last season. Milwaukee’s real 
problem lies with its pitching. 
Milwaukee recently signed 
veteran free-agent pitcher Kyle 
Lohse ago to bolster its start-
ing rotation behind ace Yovani 
Gallardo. While this move cer-
tainly helps ?rm up their start-
ing pitching, there are still ma-
jor questions with the young 
pitchers rounding out the back 
end of the rotation.
The bullpen is also a mess 
for the Brewers. Last year, 
closer John Axford blew seven 
of his ?rst 23 save opportu-
nities — part of the team’s 
league high 29 blown saves.
Fifth Place 
Chicago Cubs
Last year the Cubs were re-
ally bad, and this season ap-
pears to be no different. Play-
ing for the future is Chicago’s 
strategy during the second 
year of general manager Theo 
Epstein’s rein. The Cubs have 
a good group of young play-
ers lead by Starlin Castro and 
Anthony Rizzo, but they still 
need another year or two to 
reach their full potential.
A strong free-agent class 
headlined by starting pitchers 
Edwin Jackson, Carlos Villan-
ueva, and Scott Feldman may 
give the Cubs some spark this 
season, but the real payoff will 
come in a few years when all 
of the prospects Epstein has 
amassed begin to make the 
majors.

In a rematch of last 
month’s Intercollegiate Ten-
nis Association National 
Team Indoor Championship, 
the outcome remained the 
same as Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity nipped the Carnegie 
Mellon women’s tennis team 
5–4 Sunday afternoon. The 
fourth-ranked Blue Jays im-
proved to 7–2 on the season, 
while the seventh-ranked Tar-
tans slipped to 8–4.
The Tartans faced setbacks 
going into the match, with 
junior Katie Cecil out with 
an injury. “It was dif?cult for 
everyone to have to move up 
a position. We hope Katie has 
a quick recovery,” said sopho-
more Angela Pratt.
The Tartans were origi-
nally up 2–1 after doubles 
and gained more momentum 
when sophomore Chelsea 
Motie won at No. 1 singles. 
The pressure was on the No. 6 
singles match, but Johns Hop-
kins junior Abby Clark sealed 
the win with a 6–3 victory 
over Carnegie Mellon sopho-
more Bryn Raschke. Pratt 
gave the team its ?nal victory 
of the day in the No. 3 singles.
The Saturday before, the 
Tartans took on Washington 
and Lee University in Lex-
ington, Va., falling 2–7 to the 
18th-ranked Generals. Carn-
egie Mellon picked up its ?rst 
point with a 8–1 victory from 
the doubles duo of ?rst-year 
Brooke Tsu and sophomore 
Lydia Utkin in No. 3 doubles. 
First-year Abbey Hamstra 
won her 11th match of the 
season when she defeated 
Claire Cahill from Washing-
ton and Lee at No. 5 singles.
The team remains posi-
tive about the outcome of the 
weekend. “We were really 
close in all of our matches,” 
Tsu said.
“The team showed a lot of 
passion, but we couldn’t get 
it done,” Cecil said. “We will 
bounce back.”
The Tartans put the losses 
behind them as they look for-
ward to host the University of 
Pittsburgh on April 10.

The men’s track and ?eld 
team seized victory in its home 
mini-invitational on March 30, 
besting squads from Denison 
University, Allegheny College, 
SUNY Fredonia, and Waynes-
burg University. The men’s 
squad succeeded in both the 
running and ?eld components 
of the competition, winning 
six ?eld events and three track 
events.
The women’s team placed 
second behind Waynesburg 
University, winning four of 
the ?ve events and scoring 
129 points. First-year distance 
standout Rekha Schnepf said, 
“I think that for our second 
outdoor meet, both teams are 
looking pretty strong.... Peo-
ple are just improving a lot, 
because after going through 
indoor, everyone’s had at least 
a few experiences running in 
track events.”
The distance teams for 
both squads are performing 
at high levels. Sophomore 
Erin Kiekhaefer, senior Em-
ily Wobb, and sophomore 
Halley Bayer placed second, 
third, and fourth respec-
tively in the 1500-meter run. 
Bayer also won third in the 
800-meter run, with a time of 
2:25.44. Senior Leila Bouab-
dellaoui won second place in 
the 3000-meter steeplechase, 
with a time of 12:25.01.
Sophomore Sara Kelly 
said, “This was a good starting 
point; hopefully we can get a 
little bit of momentum going 
to the upcoming meets, which 
are going to be bigger.”
The women’s sprint team 
also did well. First-year Jenna 
Asperslag ?nished second in 
the 100-meter dash and third 
in the 200-meter, and fellow 
?rst-year Alexandra Lewis re-
ceived second in the 200.
Junior Jacqueline Guevel 
took ?rst in both the 100-me-
ter and 400-meter hurdles, 
and junior Carineh Ghafa?an 
?nished third in the 400-me-
ter run. “We have a lot of new 
girls this year and it’s nice to 
have some new faces.... We 
have a couple girls who are 
just powerhouses,” Bayer said.
Bayer praised the 4 x 400  
relay team of Kiekhaefer, 
sophomore Sasha Spalding, 
Ghafa?an, and Guevel, giving 
particular credit to Spalding. 
“[Spalding has] really been a 
key player,” Bayer said. “She 
even started throwing and 
jumping.” Spalding also com-
petes in the heptathlon for the 
track and ?eld team.
The men’s side of the team 
captured the ?rst-place prize 
with 234 points. First-year 
javelin thrower Paul Hamer-
ski placed third in the javelin, 
trailing less than three feet be-
hind the javelin winner, junior 
David Markowitz.
Speaking of the throwers, 
Hamerski said, “everyone just 
did their best ... we’re all just 
trying to improve.”
He went on to commend 
senior thrower Pat Robinson 
and Markowitz particularly 
for their personal records at 
the mini-invite, saying, “it’s 
all pretty much a constant at-
titude of getting better.”
Young players were piv-
otal to the men’s team, with 
sophomores Thomas Vanden-
berg and Douglas O’Connell 
?nishing in the top two of the 
800-meter running event, fol-
lowed by ?rst-year Marc-Dan-
iel Julien in third. The men’s 
team captured the 4 x 400 re-
lay, as well as the second-place 
prize in the pole vault due to a 
strong showing by sophomore 
Mike McDermott.
Richard Max Reinertsen, 
a ?rst-year jumper, won the 
triple jump and placed fourth 
in the long jump behind fel-
low ?rst-year Patrick Chang, 
who claimed third. “This 
year’s team is really, really 
large, with a large freshman 
class who’s contributing a lot,” 
Reinertsen said.
The track and ?eld team 
improved its overall unity at 
the tournament as well, with 
competitors making a con-
scious effort to observe and 
cheer on their teammates in 
other events.
“We’re trying to, at meets, 
watch the other events and be 
supportive as a team,” Kelly 
said.
And, at the end of the day, 
the team enjoyed the meet. 
Reinertsen said, “I think it was 
nice to be at a home meet, and 
to be able to relax and have 
fun on a beautiful day.”

Students start vodka label
Fortis uses distinctive distilling process to create sweet taste
Student-made robots, famous fashion labels, and 
top-notch actors and film producers are born 
every now and then from Carnegie Mellon. Senior 
economic and statistics major Doug Heckmann, 
senior mechanical engineering major Casey Parzych, 
and senior information systems and business 
administration double major Anthony Lorubbio are 
taking their own path to success by developing their 
own vodka label, Fortis.
The three have been working on this project since 
the fall of their junior year. Seeing how well they 
work together, one would have thought that they 
had been friends for a long time. Yet, in fact, they 
did not meet until their entrepreneur class that 
semester. As a result of their different majors, 
Heckmann, Parzych, and Lorubbio have knowledge 
and expertise in different areas, making them a 
diverse and solid team. This ability to cooperate 
allowed them to found their company, Midnight 
Madness Distilling.
Fortis’ delicately sweet taste differentiates it from 
other brands, a result of its unique distilling process 
with fair-trade, organic sugar cane. The team 
members thought of the idea while researching 
possible grains to make vodka; they unanimously 
chose sugar cane due to its scrumptious taste and 
individuality.
While they were researching filtering methods, 
the team also decided to invest in a carbon filter 
process. “The product that resulted was some of the 
smoothest vodka we’d ever tasted,” Lorubbio said.
Heckmann, who is in charge of sales and finances, 
decided to target customers who enjoy a locally 
produced hand-crafted spirit. The label is looking 
to launch its Synthe Absinthe next month during 
Carnival weekend.
One of the biggest lessons the team has come 
to learn is time management, both in terms of 
staying on top of the school’s heavy workload and 
maintaining the business’ standards. Nights seem 
to be growing longer and longer: “We did not name 
our company Midnight Madness Distilling for no 
reason,” Parzych said.
The future is a great unknown for many graduating 
seniors, but the trio is committed to further 
building this company and developing not just 
Fortis, but future brands as well. While there are 
many renowned competitors out there, Heckmann, 
Parzych, and Lorubbio know that they are different 
and really believe in their own products, which they 
hope will lead to future success.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I just read the April Fools’ 
Day issue of The Tartan, 
and I am very offended. 
Your article insulted my 
club/major/personal 
identity. I demand 
recompense! What’s the 
best way to go about 
attaining it?
Thanks,
Brusquely Upset, 
Satisfaction Yearned, But 
Otherwise Decent Yarn
Dear BUSYBODY,
Easy now, let’s not start 
throwing around heated 
words like “recompense” 
when we don’t really mean it. 
Okay, so you were offended, 
and you found a joke off-
putting. Why? Does it make 
light of a serious subject? Do 
you just not like jokes at your 
expense? Take a moment 
and think about this. It’s a 
little too easy nowadays to 
cry outrage and complain to 
people in power when a joke 
simply didn’t land well.
If a joke actually was 
offensive, then I’m sure it 
was not intended to be so 
hurtful. Yes, many jokes are 
at peoples’ expenses. They 
are also funny. It’s too easy 
for both the joker and the 
butt of the joke to forget the 
people at either end. Let’s 
not start a witch hunt unless 
someone really deserves it. 
But if we do, I’d rather be 
one of the people holding a 
torch.
This column isn’t funny 
because I’m all out of 
jokes,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m pretty sure my 
boyfriend is a robot. He’s 
usually pretty emotionless 
and cool. He takes all 
instructions very literally. 
This is all well and good, 
except I can’t get him to 
remember to do stuff for 
me! How can I update his 
programming?
Thanks,
Rather Obnoxious 
Boyfriend Oblivious, 
Since Emotions eXcite 
Uninterest, Alterations 
Likely
Dear ROBOSEXUAL,
Your boyfriend isn’t a robot. 
He’s an engineer. Yes, the 
two can be very difficult to 
tell apart. They both can 
seem cold and emotionless. 
Many tread the uncanny 
valley. But while robots run 
only on electricity, engineers 
need electricity and 
Mountain Dew.
If you want to get your 
boyfriend to do what you 
want, then you’re going to 
need to brush up on those 
skills from your required 
programming class and 
write him a script (not the 
drama kind). A few simple, 
straightforward commands, 
preferably commands he 
can enter into his phone 
as reminders. Then he’ll do 
exactly as you ask.
Unless he throws a 
runtime error,
Patrick Hoskins

“Growing up sucks.”
This sentiment was all over the radio in the ‘90s when 
bands like Nirvana, Radiohead, Weezer, and other 
alt-rock mis?ts ruled the airwaves, but it has recently 
been lacking in much of newer popular music. That 
being said, Nathan Williams, who performs under the 
name Wavves, clearly went back to his childhood CD 
collection (remember those?) in preparation for his 
band’s ?fth outing, Afraid of Heights, released last 
Tuesday on Mom+Pop records.
The record draws heavily from and pays homage to the 
greats of punk and alternative music in both musical 
and lyrical style. Like those artists he emulates, Williams 
writes songs about self-loathing, boredom, and a general 
disdain for just about everything — but with melodic, 
quiet verses and choruses with guitars and drums 
turned all the way up, they sound fun enough to shout 
along with the car windows down.
Williams has been recording under the name Wavves 
since 2008 with a rotating lineup of backing musicians. 
Along with Stephen Pope — the only other consistent 
member of the group — Williams recorded the 
entire ?fth album himself and on his own dime. This 
independence afforded the pair a great deal of freedom 
of exploration, as well as a great diversity in music styles 
on the album. Album opener “Sail to the Sun” travels at 
breakneck speed with a ?ying guitar riff that brings you 
all the way up, and then slams you back down before 
you have a chance to catch your breath. “Dog,” on the 
other hand, features haunting strings and calm acoustic 
guitars that, if it weren’t for Williams’s nasal vocal 
delivery, would sound like an unreleased track from the 
Nirvana MTV Unplugged in New York performance.
Unlike 2010’s breakthrough hit King of the Beach, which 
sounded like it was recorded in your mom’s basement, 
Afraid of Heights features slick production that doesn’t 
polish away the rough edges. The greatly improved 
production also coincides with forward leaps in song 
writing; Afraid of Heights is much more consistent than 
many of the previous Wavves outings. He indulges in 
spacey studio experimentation and loose song structure 
at times — such as on “Mystic” and “Everything Is 
My Fault” — but as a whole, nearly every song sounds 
focused and fully realized.
On Afraid of Heights, Williams is just as full of 
self-loathing and boredom as before. But while on 
King of the Beach he sounded like he was having fun 
not having fun, this time the stakes feel higher and 
the mood a little less carefree. Perhaps he’s grown up, 
and realized that the privilege of complaining about 
boredom doesn’t last forever. Afraid of Heights shows 
a songwriter with enough perspective to look back but 
also enough maturity to start looking forward — and 
what he sees in both directions scares him (just listen 
to the title track or the regret-?lled rocker “That’s on 
Me”). In many ways, Afraid of Heights harkens back to a 
time (the early-to-mid ’90s) when it seemed that being a 
slacker counted as a full-time profession to anyone could 
make a career of it. But as Williams now seems to have 
realized, we all have to grow up sometime.

Web series reworks Austen characters
The Lizzie Bennet Diaries applies Pride and Prejudice to the modern day with mixed success
“My name is Lizzie Bennet,” says the title character in 
almost each and every episode of The Lizzie Bennet 
Diaries, usually followed by some clever catch phrase 
that sums up the episode. The 100th and ?nal episode 
should probably have begun with, “My name is Lizzie 
Bennet, and while this whole web series thing is 
awesome, this isn’t actually Pride and Prejudice.”
The web series is an expanding form of media 
entertainment which entails posting videos to the 
Internet, usually in a set of episodes. This style of 
entertainment is relatively new, and has only had its 
own form of awards — the Streamy Awards — since 
2009. The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is an adaptation of Jane 
Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, a novel that follows Lizzie 
Bennet as she struggles with social expectations for 
young women in early 19th-century Britain.
The Lizzie Bennet Diaries was a fantastic idea. Creators 
Bernie Su and Hank Green took a famous and well-
known tale and used it to experiment with web series, 
a burgeoning form of entertainment. In their version, 
modern-day Lizzie Bennet uploads a video twice a week, 
describing the events of her life and starring herself, 
her two sisters Jane and Lydia, and her best friend 
Charlotte Lu (Pride and Prejudice’s Charlotte Lucas.) The 
Diaries are funny, light, and fun, especially in their initial 
episodes.
One of its biggest successes is the character of Lydia 
Bennet. In the novel, Lydia is silly, vapid, and vain. In 
the web series, Lydia is a much more vibrant and living 
character. She’s still a party girl, but the series does not 
disregard her emotions.
However, Lydia’s modern equivalent of her trip to 
Brighton — New Years’ in Las Vegas — was where 
the characterization started to go wrong. The creators 
turn the novel’s scandal — the unwed Lydia running 
away from home with a man — into an emotionally 
abusive relationship. This male character isolates and 
demoralizes Lydia in the web series, and then threatens 
to release an Internet video of the two of them having 
sex.
These two situations are not simply two versions of 
scandal in two separate periods. Pride and Prejudice 
Lydia chose her own course, in a way that Diaries 
Lydia does not. While Austen does not portray Lydia’s 
emotional state in Brighton — we only hear of it when 
Lizzie does, after the fact — Lydia at least had agency 
in the novel. She chose to run away. There is a world of 
difference between running away from home with a jerk 
and being emotionally abused. When a woman in a novel 
written in 1813 has more agency than a woman in a web 
series created in 2012, you have a problem.
But the greater issue lies in The Lizzie Bennet Diaries 
as a retelling of Austen’s most famous novel. Pride and 
Prejudice is not a classic novel because of its improbable 
love story. How many other virtuous yet poor girls were 
swept off their feet by rich men in Victorian literature? 
And how many of them do we remember?
We remember Austen because she was one of the best 
satirists in the English language. She created characters 
that were the epitome of satirical wit: Mr. and Mrs. 
Bennet, Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and even 
Lizzie herself all represented different facets of Austen’s 
own culture during that period. These characters are 
brilliantly written, funny, and memorable on multiple 
levels, but they are not suitable for every age and period.
Austen’s satire is timeless, but it is not applicable to 
modern-day America. The differences between social 
norms, societal expectations, and personal hopes in early 
19th-century England and early 21st-century America 
are vast, and Austen’s humorous critique of the former 
does not apply to the latter. Austen satirizes a 19th-
century phenomenon: the absolute need for women 
to conform if they want to have ?nancial and social 
stability. Though the creators do try to replicate Austen’s 
restrictive world — mostly by having the Bennet girls 
worry about college and ?nancial security — the two 
situations just aren’t the same. Women today must 
deal with social expectations, of course, but their entire 
futures no longer rely on emulating such a strict ideal.
That being said, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is a great 
example of what a web series can become. This new 
form of entertainment is one of the most interactive 
forms ever. Each of the characters in the series has his or 
her own Tumblr and Twitter accounts, updated regularly, 
and they each answer questions and comments in a 
variety of Q & A videos. The writers and creators of the 
show worked hard to make these characters as real and 
accessible as possible. While Pride and Prejudice may 
not have been the most judicious choice of a story to 
start out with, the web series genre has a bright future.

Warning: This article contains spoilers.
Season three is coming — dark and full of terrors. And 
most importantly, when you’re on Game of Thrones, you 
either win or you die.
The long-anticipated release of the third and most recent 
season of Game of Thrones aired last night on HBO. 
Since the end of season two, which aired in late May last 
year, the hype has only escalated recently.
The series, based upon the book series A Song of Ice 
and Fire by American author George R. R. Martin, was 
launched in April 2011. Martin originally intended the 
series to be a trilogy but has since decided to extend the 
series to seven novels, all of which are about as thick 
as encyclopedias. The novels, ?ve of which have been 
released, follow characters whose stories are strewn with 
more plot twists than an M. Night Shyamalan movie.
Because Martin is positively cruel with his characters, 
it’s impossible to say who the main characters are: Just 
as you’re getting used to following one, he or she dies. 
As of the end of season two, the primary characters 
(knock on wood) included Daenerys Targaryen, a 
platinum-haired mother of dragons; Jon Snow, a lord’s 
bastard who ?ghts frozen zombies; Tyrion Lannister, a 
clever dwarf with a family from hell; and Robb Stark, an 
accidental candidate for king who leads an army. On the 
continents Westeros and Easteros, storms are brewing 
over who will take over the throne, and from there, a 
plethora of problems ensue.
The amount of detail that goes into writing the novels 
and the screenplay is arguably the most compelling part 
of the show. The story lines are so intricate that Martin 
has even divulged key plot points from the last two 
novels to the show’s creators, HBO’s David Benioff and 
D.B. Weiss, in case something should happen to him 
before he is able to ?nish writing them.
Few people had heard of the books, which are now 
bestsellers, until the release of the show. For a show 
that’s just turning two years old, Game of Thrones 
has acquired a massive cult following. The story and 
characters have positively exploded in pop culture, 
?ooding the Internet and garnering nods from TV shows 
like The Of?ce and television personalities such as 
Jon Stewart. At the end of season two, episodes were 
attracting more than 10 million viewers, pushing the 
show to the third-most popular in HBO’s history.
Season three started last night with an episode entitled 
“Valar Dohaeris.” In a horrifyingly stressful moment, the 
network’s online service, HBO Go, was overloaded by the 
amount of viewers trying to access the episode, which 
delayed viewers from watching.
During the episode, the story lines of all the major 
players were set up for yet another season of intrigue. 
Jon Snow’s journey beyond the Wall continues, and we 
?nally met Mance Rayder, the King Beyond the Wall and 
a new key player.
It was clear from this episode that the drama beyond 
the Wall, which involves not only a rebellion of Wildings 
but an army of the frozen undead, will be a signi?cant 
portion of the season. Though not much was seen of 
Snow’s half-brother Robb Stark, in this episode he 
continues to deal with the backlash from his mother’s 
decision to release their prime prisoner, Jaime Lannister 
(a.k.a. the Kingslayer) and march North back to their 
home at Winterfell.
In the Southern capital of Westeros, schemes and plots 
continue to emerge: Tyrion, everyone’s favorite witty 
ex-Hand of the King, deals with family and daddy issues 
— and as a result, he loses what little credibility he had 
managed to gain. Sansa Stark, daughter of poor dead 
Ned Stark, is offered an escape from her prison in King’s 
Landing by Lord Baelish, the sneaky whorehouse owner 
and banker of the king. The new queen, Margaery Tyrell, 
butts heads with her mother-in-law, Cersei — the letter-
ripping former queen and mother of Joffery Barathan, the 
worst human being to walk the Earth.
Across the Narrow Sea, the beautiful and badass 
Daenerys Targaryen, faithful adviser Jorah Mormont, 
and her three growing dragons procure a ship and sail to 
Astapor, a new location for viewers. In just one episode, 
she deals with slave traders, a warlock attempting to 
assassinate her, and an army of eunuchs.
All in all, the episode seems to focus on the schemes 
of King’s Landing, the dragon queen of Easteros, and 
the horrifying terrors of the frozen wasteland beyond 
the Wall, leaving viewers both satis?ed and curious for 
the season that will continue to unfold over the next 10 
weeks.

If you love spring break, partying, and Britney Spears, 
go watch Spring Breakers now. If you hate spring break, 
partying, and Britney Spears, go watch Spring Breakers 
now. Go straight to the nearest theater playing it. Even if 
that means taking the 61D all the way to the Waterfront 
in this endlessly miserable Pittsburgh weather, it’s time 
better spent than sitting in your bed whilst having a 
Vampire Diaries marathon with a jar of Nutella in your 
hands.
Spring Breakers is the latest project by controversial 
director Harmony Korine. Selena Gomez, Vanessa 
Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and the otherwise-obscure 
Rachel Korine (wife of the director) star as four bored 
college girls who just want to have fun. However, their 
idea of fun entails stealing a car to rob a local Chicken 
Shack, going to insane parties, and getting tied up with 
some messy drug dealers. James Franco plays one such 
drug dealer named Alien who is incredibly suspicious, 
yet declares himself a “gangster with a heart of gold.” 
Clad with absurdly questionable tattoos, grills, and 
cornrows, Franco decides to take these four girls — who 
seem too dazed to be suspicious of the fact that he is a 
dangerous drug dealer — under his wing. The exception 
is Gomez’s character Faith, who somewhat serves as 
the moral compass of the posse. But when Franco plays 
Britney Spears’ “Everytime” for the girls on his grand 
piano, it is enough to win everyone’s trust and love.
Another great reason to watch this movie is rapper 
Gucci Mane, who stars as rival drug dealer Big Arch. 
The man wouldn’t even take off his ice cream cone 
chains for the movie — but I suppose that it helped 
bring out his character. The rapper honestly didn’t even 
have to act; he was method acting even more than 
Franco simply by impersonating himself. I guess that’s 
all you can ask from a fading rapper clutching at his last 
minutes of fame by the chains.
But don’t assume this is a just a vapid intersection 
of Project X and Girls Gone Wild. Neither is it an 
exploitation of Disney stars. The ?lm makes a very 
dark transformation from a crowd-pleasing party to a 
dark underworld of reckless violence. Also, the “spring 
breakers” themselves are very entertaining and carry 
the ?lm well enough to defy expectations; they make 
debauchery seem like an acceptable art form for cinema.
Never for one second will you be bored watching 
Spring Breakers — and I don’t mean that the director 
continually tries to shove things down the movie-making 
machine so as not to lose your attention. Spring Breakers 
is a believable-yet-fantastical portrayal of four girls who 
decide to ?irt with the dangers of being young, wild, and 
free. You’ll either love it or hate it, and probably for the 
same reasons. Either way, it’s unlike anything you’ve 
seen before, and that alone is worth a trip to the movies.

There is an alien world in the subterranean depths 
of Doherty Hall, a world in which ?ne arts students 
feverishly try to imbue their creations with artistic spirit. 
Last week, a chunk of that world was excavated for the 
rest of campus to see.
Basement Miracle, the 2013 master of ?ne arts thesis 
exhibition, opened last Friday in the Miller Gallery in 
the Purnell Center for the Arts. The MFA thesis exhibit, 
organized annually by the School of Art, features the 
work of graduating master of ?ne arts students and offers 
an opportunity for the students to display their work in a 
professional gallery exhibition open to the public.
The exhibit, which consists mainly of sculptures and 
installations, spans all three ?oors of the Miller Gallery. 
The works use a variety of media and touch upon many 
different subjects, although there are some common 
themes such as the integration of technology and 
science. The exhibition draws a sizable crowd of both 
Carnegie Mellon students and the greater public.
The ?rst ?oor of the exhibit showcases an installation by 
Erin Womack called “Guardian of the Threshold,” which 
consists of a dark room with a shifting face projected 
onto the screen and three African masks protruding out 
of the back of the room. The face, demonic in nature, 
changes in sync to the constant throbs of music in the 
background, creating a tense mood throughout the room.
The second ?oor seems to have a broad theme of 
technology and industrialization. All of the works on this 
?oor feature the use of machinery or engineering.
Luke Loef?er’s works “Bug Out” and “Aqua Vitae” deal 
with the politics of alcohol and seem designed to give off 
an industrial aesthetic. “Bug Out,” for example, features 
a contraption that rotates a liquor bottle in a wooden 
frame. “Aqua Vitae” displays lab materials such as 
beakers and bottles of chemical compounds.
“Aqua Vitae” also showcases recordings of deep sea 
vents and three ?sh swimming in a sink. According 
to Loef?er, “in some cultures alcohol is considered 
the water of life. The ocean is also thought of as the 
birthplace of life, especially deep sea vents. In this piece 
I’m con?ating these two things, and I’m confronting the 
stereotypes of moonshiners.”
In addition to machines and contraptions, many of the 
works allow for audience participation as well.  
“(Un)bound”, by Felipe Castelblanco, for example, 
features an air compressor and a device that packages 
air, allowing viewers to pack and take home their own 
boxes of air.
Castelblanco described the idea behind the piece: “I 
was interested in air as public space that is becoming 
privatized and controlled; even this very common thing, 
air, is not equally distributed,” he said. “Some air is 
polluted and some air is fresh. This looks at the world 
and politics, and what created this social structure.”

Another work that features audience involvement is 
“Borderland” by Craig Fahner, an installation with coal-
?lled jars and speakers hanging from the ceiling. The 
coal serves as radio antennae that change the wave they 
broadcast depending on how far away they are from 
someone.
According to Fahner, the piece was inspired by the 
National Radio Quiet Zone in West Virginia, an area 
where any device emitting radio waves is illegal due to 
the black hole research conducted there. On creating 
the piece, Fahner said, “It took a long time to ?nish. I 
planned it in October and I designed the software and 
electronics for it. It was a long process, but the School of 
Art had a lot of resources I was able to use to make my 
own circuit.”
Some works involve neither intricate engineering nor 
complicated technology but are effective nonetheless. 
Steve Gurysh’s “The Long Cloud,” for example, is a 
Geiger meter clicking away before a picture of a patch of 
desert. It is a simple but nonetheless haunting piece that 
conveys the dangers involved in nuclear technology.
The third ?oor only showcases two works, and therefore, 
there is not as much of a theme. However, the works 
themselves were still highly interesting. Dan Wilcox’s 
“Onward to Mars” featured photographs that Wilcox took 
during his time at the Mars Desert Research Station, 
where he spent two weeks on a simulated Mars mission, 
as well as a book he made documenting his thoughts at 
the time.
According to Wilcox, “I was always interested in Mars 
and I read all kinds of books about it. But these were all 
from a macro perspective, and I wanted to see what it’s 
like for an everyday person to do work and live on Mars.”
Finally, one of the most visually stunning installations 
in the exhibit is Scott Andrew’s “Gilding the Lily,” an 
installation ?lled with elaborately designed oval “mirrors” 
that show projections of surreal glam monsters. These 
mirrors, which are also out?tted with speakers, all play 
at the same time, combining to create a sound akin to 
chanting. This chanting, together with the fantastic 
images, makes viewers feel as if they are stepping into 
some sort of Buddhist Narnia.
“Gilding the Lily” is actually a self-portrait, expressing 
Andrew’s interests in dance, ideas of gender, and sci-?/
fantasy genres. It is also a re?ection of the work he has 
done over the years. As he explained, “I have been doing 
a combination of performance and installations, and I 
have a blend of video and sculpture in this piece. Also, I 
usually work with performers, but in this I performed as 
all the characters.”
Although it features few works from only seven artists, 
Basement Miracle is certainly worth browsing for the 
sheer originality and variety of subject matter that 
it offers. Combining different designs, technologies, 
and a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences, 
Basement Miracle comes together to be something that 
is unique to Carnegie Mellon.

Tucked away in a side gallery on the second 
?oor, Japan Is the Key… is a small and seemingly 
nondescript new exhibit at the Carnegie Museum 
of Art. The exhibit, which opened last Saturday, 
features Japanese color woodblock prints, 
watercolors, and ivory ?gurines made in the ?rst half 
of the 19th century.
Although the exhibit is fairly small — ?lling 
only three small rooms — it probably could have 
been condensed further. The exhibit is largely 
homogenous, mostly because nearly all of the works 
are from the same time period and use the same 
medium. Oftentimes, the walls are lined with a long 
series of works by the same artist. Aside from the 
occasional watercolor and the small ivory collection 
in centrally placed display cases, the works almost 
exclusively consist of color woodblock prints. Even 
the color palette of pale reds and sea blues is very 
similar from print to print.
The exception is a striking series of taller, narrower 
prints by Torii Kiyonaga and Tamagawa Shucho that 
line the middle room. Looking closer, the subjects 
of the prints look oddly cut off, like badly cropped 
Facebook pro?le pictures. Still, from afar, the sharply 
vertical shape makes these prints the most visually 
captivating pieces in the exhibit.
Though the exhibit is not the most eye-catching or 
diverse overall, there is beauty to be found in these 
pieces through the technique and level of detail 
used to create them. Even centuries later, the lines 
of the prints are crisp and precise, and the colors 
fade exquisitely and seamlessly across the paper. 
A particularly striking example of intricate, pristine 
printmaking is “Night Rain at Oyama” by Utagawa 
Toyokuni II, which streaks diagonal lines across the 
page to represent sheets of rain obscuring a view of 
the mountain.
Within the exhibit, there are two distinct categories: 
landscapes that provide wide, sweeping views of 
mountains and lakes, and closer snapshots of human 
life (usually women). Despite the repetition within 
these categories — one can only look at so many 
prints of Mount Fuji — the subject matter is perhaps 
the most thought-provoking dimension to the 
exhibit. Considering the time period during which 
they were made, some of the pieces are surprisingly 
satirical and suggestive. Kitagawa Utamaro’s “The 
Four Accomplishments,” for example, is a parody 
of classical painting style that depicts courtesans 
in an Edo pleasure house, many of them in playfully 
suggestive poses.
These kinds of pieces clash with our highly 
traditional and hierarchical understanding of 
feudal Japan, and challenge us to reassess our 
understanding of the role of art in 19th-century 
Japan. Though on the surface, these prints may look 
repetitive and bland, a few of them make playful 
artistic commentary that is easy to overlook.
In this way, Japan Is the Key… requires more 
patience and willingness to think than many art 
exhibits. These pieces won’t grab your attention 
right away; in fact, they may bore you after a while. 
Japan Is the Key… is not for museum goers who 
want to breeze through an exhibit; it requires a 
closer, more careful look and a viewer who is willing 
to search for the hidden value in a work of art.
