Four Fraternity houses were 
robbed during the early hours of 
Sunday morning, of cash, jewelry 
and other valuables. It was esti­
mated that the thief or thieves 
moved quickly among the houses, 
breaking in or entering by un­
locked back doors, sometime af­
ter 3:00 a.m. Entry was made from 
the back door of Theta Xi, and 
many negotiable items were tak­
en, including cash, checks, watch­
es and rings. Delta Tau Delta was 
invaded through an unlocked win­
dow, after attempts had been 
made to jimmy the doors. The 
Delts estimated a loss of $200, 
stolen from rooms where brothers 
were sleeping.
A spokesman for Phi Kappa 
Theta said that about $300 in cash 
was missing Sunday morning, 
along with four or five watches. 
The vandals had evidently plan­
ned the robbery carefully, using 
the first week of parties in the 
houses to their advantage.
The fourth vandalized house, 
Delta Upsilon, reported a some­
what smaller loss than the others, 
this time primarily in checks and 
cash. Security is investigating the 
crime, and it is hoped that a quick 
recovery of the stolen articles and 
money will be made.

Film Arts Announces New Season
C-MU Campus Responds 
To King Scholarship Drive
Despite the end of the year madhousing, a special effort struck 
a responsive note on Carnegie-Mellon’s campus last May. It was 
initiated by the following, by now well-known, resolutions:
“Be it resolved that there shall be established at Carnegie- 
Mellon University, as a memorial in honor of a great American, 
the Martin Luther King Scholarship Fund. As a symbol of our 
dedication towards an achievement of a more integrated Univer­
sity, the funds are to be solicited within the campus from students, 
faculty and staff.”
The campus drive began May 
7, 1968 with the first gift and the 
latest as of August 23,1968 results 
are exciting:

In additiontoall the individ-
ual pledges, a number of campus 
organizations have pledged funds 
from their treasuries. The Tartan 
contributed $750; the Association 
of Women Students donated $200; 
the General Faculty Organization 
contributed $250; Local 29 of the 
Building Service Employees Inter­
national Union contributed $200; 
and $650 raised from the student 
body via the Campus Chest Com­
mittee has been added to the 
scholarship fund.
Fund-raisers say that compar­
ed to usual fund efforts the amount 
paid thus far on the pledges is ex­
ceptional. However, there still re­
mains about $4,000 in unpaid 
pledges. These pledges may be 
payed at the Cashier’s Office in 
Warner Hall on or before Septem­
ber 30, 19^8. Anyone wishing 
to make a contribution may still 
do so at the Development Office 
on the fifth floor of Warner Hall.
In accordance with the stated 
purposes of the fund drive, the Uni­
versity is administering the funds 
(and will continue to administer 
an endowed scholarship) in a man­
ner deemed most appropriate for 
the achievement of an integrated 
campus. This means that, given 
the present situation at C-MU, 
the scholarship funds will initially 
be awarded to black students. 
When C-MU achieves an inte­
grated campus, the scholarship 
will be awarded only according to 
need. Five thousand dollars is be­
ing allocated as an endowed 
scholarship constituting a perman-

Letter from Momma
The Tartan tends to think of it­
self as circulated almost strictly 
on the campus. Our articles and 
opinions are directed toward the 
students and the faculty, admin­
istration and staff.
While cleaning house for the 
coming year we found a touch­

Tech Grad Protests 
New Food Regime
Editor, The Tartan,
This year, at last, there will 
probably be much talk and action 
on our campus concerning student 
power, its applicability to cer­
tain areas, and the manner in 
which it should be effected For 
those who are considering hav­
ing a revolution, I should like to 
present a subject on which they 
may focus, for it is truly one of 
the most revolting abuses of ad­
ministrative power on our belov­
ed campus. I refer of course, to 
the machinations of the minions 
of the Food Services Department.
Three years ago, or so, Mr. L. 
E. Price came to our beloved cam­
pus to administer a Food Service 
Program which would be ours, and 
which would attempt to do away 
with the arbitrary management 
methods of Stouffer Foods Services 
In carrying out his task. Mr. Price 
delegated a good deal of binding 
advisory power to a committee 
of students. He relied on that com­
mittee’s advice, and sought to 
broaden the base of student parti-
serves to maintain the family ties 
stressed by leaving home for col­
lege. It warms the Tartan’s senti­
mental old heart to be able to aid 
and foster filial affection.
Read the following letter, and 
remember your mother still loves 
you.
cipation in Food Services af­
fairs.
Indeed, I am hard put to think 
of a major decision which was 
carried out by Mr. Price with­
out the consent of at least a few 
members of the committee. Ad­
ditionally, Mr. Price instituted a 
program of employment which 
provided many students with part 
time jobs in the various opera­
tions of the Food Services, and 
he attempted to integrate Food 
Services into the scheme of things 
with relation to the use of Skibo 
as a student union.
Since his departure, Food Serv­
ices has been run by Mr. Steve 
Bucko and Mr. Robert Stewart, 
neither of whom seem to have the 
same consideration for their cus­
tomers as Mr. Price did. At the 
end of last year, it was announc­
ed that there was going to be sub­
stantial change in the form of 
food contracts as well as the 
prices thereof. The decisions on 
these contracts were reached in 
some manner or other without the 
advice or consent of the still op­
erating, but castrated, Student 
Food Management Committee.
New Publication: 
The Banher
Last spring, several students 
felt the need and desire to create 
a new campus publication. The 
first issue of The Star Spangled 
Banner appeared late in May. 
The magazine was designated to 
complement existing publications 
by printing the creative efforts of 
CMU undergrads, grad students, 
faculty, etc. on a regular basis. 
The Banner is now ready, with 
the aid of its sponsor, The Tar­
tan, to begin publication.
The staff is all ready to start 
work on the first issue and Oc­
tober 7 has been set as the dead­
line for submitting any work for 
the first issue. This is an open 
invitation to all CMU people. If 
you write (prose, poetry), draw, 
snap pictures, create satire or car­
toons and would like to see your 
efforts in print, please feel free 
to contact either Barbara Rubel,
682-8897, or Ellen Blissman, 682- 
8895. You can also leave your 
work in the Banner’s mailbox be­
hind the information desk in Ski­
bo.
This year, upon return the stu­
dent body has dicovered that all 
Food Services “catering” to stu­
dents is divided into three parts. 
There is the snack shop, former­
ly the Staff Cafeteria, there is 
the Tartan Grill, and there is the 
Cafeteria for those inclined to 
games of chance, for “you pays 
your money and then you sees 
what you gets.” Menus are avail­
able listing the offerings of the 
day, a castback to the now im- 
Potent student committee,but ad­
vance sight of the food itself is 
not. The commuting students, es­
pecially the Freshmen, will find 
it very interesting indeed to see 
what they have purchased for 
such accommodating prices.
However, the most outrageous 
deed which has been perpetrat­
ed here is the separation of the 
student body into “them what 
has and them what hasn't” got 
the money to eat in the cafeteria. 
As a part of the Student Union, 
the cafeteria should be a place 
where students can get together 
over lunch, even if one does not 
have the means or desires to pur­
chase said meal, and discuss com­
mon problems or whatever they 
want to discuss. As it stands now, 
absent lunch, one cannot enter 
the cafeteria to sit and talk. (In­
deed, one cannot even use the 
cafeteria as a means of exiting 
from the building.)
I believe therefore, that the ac­
tions of the management of Food 
Services are both arbitrary and 
an insult to the rights of the Stu­
dent Body to use the Student 
Union, and that those who port­
end to be the guardians of Stu­
dent Rights should have the afore­
mentioned policies of Food Serv­
ices changed.

CHICAGO 
COMMENT
Editor, the TARTAN
We feel well qualified to re­
ply to the shocking editorial ap­
pearing in the September 18, is­
sue of The Tartan. The correla­
tion between your story and the 
report of out man-on-the-street 
is amazing. Below follows a per­
sonal interview:
“Hello, truth-seeking American 
public. This is Kent Clark, mild- 
mannered reporter for a large me­
tropolitan newspaper, I’m stand­
ing here at the corner of Michigan 
and Balbo Streets. There is some­
thing missing from the mood of 
the city. I feel no carnival in 
the air; just grimness and con­
centration. People are going some­
where to do something. It isn’t 
about to be pleasant, either. Wait.
I see a policeman now. Oh, sir, 
could you describe your reaction 
to this encounter?”
“Out of my way, punk, I’m 
a pot-bellied, leering, tyrannical 
fuzz—and proud as Punch to be 
here at the corner of Michigan 
here tonight.”
The specific concerns and act­
ivities of the new Office will be 
shaped by university and non­
university participants. Possible 
programs will include volunteer 
services through Pittsburgh and 
national agencies, experimenta­
tion in interpersonal communica­
tion, participation in intercolleg­
iate conferences on urban and ra­
cial problems, responsible explora­
tion of social issues, and the de­
velopment of an international di­
mension in the University. Some 
of these activities are, in fact, al­
ready in progress: a student-fac- 
ulty committee has acted to im­
prove the racial diversity of the 
incoming freshman class by broad­
ening recruitment and admissions 
procedures; over three dozen 
CMU tutors have been placed in 
Pittsburgh summer tutorial pro­
grams; Mr. Huff and thirteen stu­
dents participated in the Philip­
pine Project this past summer; the 
initial preparations for interrac- 
cial workshops are completed; ar­
rangements are now being made 
for an International Symposium; 
and, a proposed conference on the 
role of the University in society 
is on the drawing board.
The existing programs have en­
volved in accord with the object­
ives and auspices of the Carnegie- 
Mellon YMCA & YWCA. Because 
both the YM-WCA and the OCA 
share many of the same concerns 
both entities will function jointly 
in the coming academic year. 
Tom Huff and Heathersmith.YM 
CA and YWCA executives will 
serve as coordinators of Com­
munity Affairs; the office facili­
ties will be identical. The Ys will 
still have a separate student ex­
ecutive and student faculty-alum- 
ni boards to work with “Y” busin­
ess and program. However, there 
will be no predetermined distinc­
tion between the programs or styles 
of the two entities. Any func­
tional distinctions which develop 
will be the natural results of op­
eration during the first, experi­
mental year of the OCA’s exis­
tence.

As he spoke I noted the red-neck, 
fists like hams, and fat huge 
arms.
“I have only hate in my eyes,’’ 
he fumed on, obviously enchanted 
by the chance to tell his side.
I really reveal my true personality 
when I satiate my blood lust by 
nothing short of wood on bond.”
I could not help but notice the 
hate in his eyes. To look at him 
made my blood run cold. Here 
was incarnate hate. Obviously 
even Mayor Daley’s power could 
not hold the red-neck back.
The pot-bellied brute belched on: 
“Why just fifteen minutes ago I 
really laid into a former engin­
eer who had given up making 
water-proof toilet paper to attempt 
to engineer a bullet - proof soc­
iety. And that little old lady path­
etically walking up the street 
hunched over caughing. Why I 
think if she had only been forc­
ed to remain on the street she 
might have died. Unfortunately 
some draft-dodgers and hoods heip- 
ed her into a hotel.”
By now my mild manners could 
barely be held in tow. Didn’t he 
realize that these kids weren’t all 
fifteen year-old love-hippies? They 
were shoppers office girls, men 
in the street . . . part of a move­
ment committed to a difficult, 
dangerous path, without a goal or 
a plan of action. I felt like re­
signing myself from it all but 
still the “pig” (I had acquired 
the vernacular) bellowed.
“The worst carnage is yet to 
come. I’m here to hurt first and 
most. Even those Birchers are so 
far left that I need a telescope 
to see them.”
He went on raging in uncontrol­
lable fury, but by now, merci­
fully, the Battle Hymn of the 
Republic overwhelmed the pot­
belly’s amplified brass band. I 
walked down Balbo, midst red­
necks and victims. Truly, the cry 
of dissent foreshadows the end of 
the current marching in search of 
a better way. And that would be 
the end of my news career as 
exploiter of extablishment vio­
lence.”

c/o The Tartan
Carnegie-,ellon University,
Dear Mr. Waneetlk,
Since my daughter le a student at C-K-U,
I subscribe to thè Tartan to keep up with the noose, and 
the many affairs you have on campus. I have found, however, 
that It is almost a hopeless task to Interpret eooe of the 
material your newspaper contains.
In an article on the pros and cons of co-ed 
dorms, I read, or tried to, that hosing condldtlons at C-K-U 
have been oonsldred unacceptable. It was also mentioned 
that girls don’t want to take their curlers out before break­
fast. Perhaps If I knew what a curler was, I could evaluate 
the situation a little better.
I was Interested especially In learning 
that students will have ar> opportunity to take a course In 
creative wlrtlng soon. C-M-U, obviously Is the only school In 
the nation offering such a curse. Also, I planned on attend­
ing the ssnlor painters show In the Skibo looby, but when 
It was revealed that It consisted of 44 paintings in a variety 
of mepla, I decided against it, as I prefer sepia and other 
oolors as a media, rather than mepla, whatever that le.
I sincerely hope that during Ester vacation 
you desk staff brushes up on their prof-reading, as I'd 
really like to know if it's true that Fudge House re-opens 
for dinner on Tues. April 16th.
Typoerltlcally yours.

An Office of Community Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon Uni­
versity has been created to serve the interest among members 
of the University in greater social awareness and growing in­
volvement in the community. The Office reflects the Univer­
sity’s commitment to developing social responsibility as an in­
tegral part of education today. The Community Affairs Office will be 
a base from which students, faculty, and other citizens interact to 
understand and improve the campus community, the metropolitan en­
vironment, and the wider national and international communities.

Lecture Hour 
Open for Meetings
Upon the recommendation of 
the Assembly Committee the re­
sponsibility of the Campus acti­
vities center and budget assigned 
to it have been delegated to Mr. 
Robert W. McCurdy. Manager. 
The scheduling of the 11:30 hour 
on Tuesday will continue to be 
open for cultural and intellectual 
programs and organization meet­
ings.
Since no single auditorium will 
hold the entire campus communi­
ty, it is presumed that no single 
program or activity will be permit­
ted to pre-empt the 11:30 time. It 
is suggested that departments, col­
leges, and student organizations 
schedule programs in campus au­
ditoriums at 11:30 Tuesdays list­
ing them in the Campus Calen­
dar so that information about 
them is widely disseminated. 
Such groups are also urged to 
schedule programs at other hours 
when the campus community is 
likely to be able to attend. In 
the future individual depart­
ments, colleges, or student organ­
izations should reserve the audi­
torium which they wish to use 
and notify the Editor, Sibley Dit- 
mmer, in Public Relations. Her 
files will provide a useful clear­

A.A.P. Presents Environmental Show
The Associated Artists of Pittsburgh is an organization of approxi­
mately 500 professional and semi-professional local artists. Every spring

works in any media. The idea be­
hind the show: To make the arts 
a part of the life of the city and 
to suggest the need for all of the 
people to participate in its crea­
tion. Our environment means Pitts­
burgh. We can make our envir­
onment more meaningful, useful 
and beautiful by changing it—by 
creating some part of it.
We invite all, not only artists, 
but students, business men, school 
teachers, mill workers, mem­
bers of city government, the un­
employed—All citizens to partici­
pate. We owe it to our selves and 
to the community that we share 
to add our own ideas about mak­
ing Pittsburgh a better place to 
live.
We invite you to create a film, 
a poem, a public playground, 
a garden, a tape recording, a 
dance, a total environment, a 
painting, a structure, a sculp­
ture. a photographic essay, a 
musical composition, a play, a 
book. Any idea for a work that 
will reach out from yourself to 
your community (beyond your own 
livingroom. your own home» 
that will affect the Pittsburgh 
environment—is eligible: art in 
buses, offices, schools, streets, al­
leys, parks and public buildings. 
Create art to celebrate being alive 
and being together in Pittsburgh 
now.
1. Eligibility. Anyone, any

“One of the naost meaningful 
tributes to the late Dr. Martin 
Luther King. Jr., has been action.
“And that’s good. Because it's 
black action. And that's what 
Black Power means.''
Speaking was young playwright 
Floyd B. Barbour. Barbour is edi­
tor of the recently published The 
Black Power Revolt, a collection 
of 36 essays examining Black Pow­
er as a concept and a movement.
Since publication a month ago 
by Porter Sargent's Extending 
Horizons Books, the book has 
been acclaimed nationally by re­
viewers and commentators.
The latest review, by Robert 
C. Maynard of the Washington 
Post, called Barbour's book on 
Black Power “the best to date.'
In a recent conversation. Bar­
bour was discussing the possible 
impact of his book on events now 
taking place in America. Since 
the assassination of Dr. King, a 
chain of “black action-’ events 
has caused a faint glimmer of 
hope among some black leaders.
As examples. Barbour cited re­
cent occurrences in Boston, where 
the young writer moved from 
Washington, DC., to compile 
The Black Power RevoLt.:
— Sit-ins protesting the existence 
of parking lots on land that once 
held low-income housing. Demo­
lition of existing dwellings has 
been halted. Spurred by Thomas 
I. Atkins, only black member of 
the Boston City Council, a “con­
flict-of-interest” probe of the park­
ing lots is shaping up.
— Formation of a Small Business 
Development Center in Boston s 
Roxbury section to aid develop­
ment of black-operated businesses 
in black neighborhoods.
— Gift of a former synagogue 
and school to Boston's black com­
munity for development of a 
drama and art center. The facili­
ties — valued at more than $1 mil­
lion — were sold by Jewish organi­
zations to the Elma Lewis School 
of Fine Arts for $1. The scope 
of the donation and plans for fu­
ture development of the cultural 
center are believed to constitute 
historic firsts in the nation.
— Announcement by Avco Cor­
poration of plans to build a print­
ing plant in the heart of the Rox- 
bury-Dorchester Negro Section. 
Employment will be predominant­
ly black. It is believed to be the 
first instance of a white-run cor­
poration building a major branch 
in a black community and turn­
ing over management and opera­
tion to blacks.
— Black student protestors at 
Boston University asking for high­
er numbers of blacks among stu­
dents and faculty and increased 
scholarship aid for black students. 
The University President called 
10 or 11 student demands “reason­
able” and promised they would be 
met.
Essays in The Black Power Re­
volt show just how significant 
these events are. For example. 
Dr. Nathan Wright. Jr., author 
and one-time freedom rider and 
CORE field secretary, defines

ity leadership. In his essay. Dr. 
Wright states:
“However wise it may be. no 
outside leadership has that cru­
cially significant ingredient of 
that inner drive and urgency to be 
free which can come only from 
one who is a part of the oppressed.'
Most black programs, however 
their particular objective or ap­
proach may vary, stress this ques­
tion of leadership — black leader­
ship with black support.
As Barbour points out.
“Black leadership does not nec­
essarily exclude white coopera­
tion. On the contrary, white co­
operation can be important if 
America is to be saved from chaos.
“We’re seeing signs of black 
leadership and white cooperation 
in Boston. There are indications 
that segments of white society 
finally understand the problem 
and, more important, are ready 
to let blacks act, on their own. 
toward solutions.
“This is the kind of white co­
operation that is needed. It en­
courages black action. Not white 
leading black, nor black leading 
white, but black leading black.
“These are all good signs. We 
can only hope they continue and 
that many more follow.”
“Link” Program 
Needs Volunteers
The first meeting of volunteers 
for this fall’s “Link” program will 
be held Friday, September 27, at 
7 p.m. in the Ballroom, Pitt Stu­
dent Union. Now known as “Y's 
Link.” the program was origina­
ted by Vista Volunteers in Pitts­
burgh. which secured Community 
Chest funds to underwrite its ex­
penses.
Through “Link”, college volun­
teers work with small groups of 
children, ages seven to twelve, 
developing with them cultural 
and recreational programs which 
meet their needs and interests. 
A volunteer, is expected to under­
go training and to meet, with his 
group at least once a week for 
three hours. Training will include 
guidance in working with groups 
of children, in using the resources 
of the city to develop projects 
with them, and in tutoring and re­
medial reading skills if the volun­
teer desires to work with a group 
of children with these needs. C- 
MU students who have been “Link” 
volunteers in the past (including 
fifteen this summer) report very 
satisfying experiences in the close 
relationship which developes with 
the group of children.
Additional information on “Link” 
may be securred from Heather 
Smith or Tom Huff at the C-MU

“Prisoners are the greatest audience that an entertainer can perform 
for” says Johnny Cash in the liner notes he has handwritten. Perhaps 
after hearing the response Cash received from these guys, other artists 
might be inspired to play the prison circuit. To put it midly, the al­
bum is very exciting, even more exciting when it is realized that it took 
six years to convince the Columbia record executives that this kind of 
artistand audience relationship might prove successjful.
Johnny Cash, a long-time Country and Western Star, has been play­
ing Folsom Prison for years. Though not a former resident himself, he 
obviously has the warmth and compassion to speak their language. He 
clowns with them, swears a bit and is incredibly honest with the in­
mates.
It is the combination of the songs and Cash’s performance that 
make this album great. Of the sixteen numbers on the record, five were 
written by Cash, including the opening Folsom Prison Blues. The songs 
have an immense appeal to this unique audience but the album is of 
such a nature that the listener outside of Folsom will empathize too.
One song, Twenty-Five Minutes to Go, tells of a man on death 
row experiencing the last moments of life right up until the actual 
hanging. Dirty Old Egg Sucking Dog and Flushed From the Bathroom 
of your Heart are novelties having little or nothing to do with prison- 
more evidence of the intelligence shown by both Cash and producer 
Bob Johnston.
Two of the best songs on side two are Give My Love to Rose-a deva­
stating number about a man released from prison found dying on the 
railroad tracks, never having made it back to his wife and ten year old 
son—and I Got Stripes, a raucous ditty about a guy who managed to 
commit a crime, get caught, arrested, convicted and imprisoned in a 
week. The last selection is one that was sung for the first time by 
Cash the night before this album was made. It is called Greystone 
Chapel and was written by George Shirley, an inmate at Folsom.
The technical aspects of the disc are excellent. With its release, 
Columbia ( notorious for imperfect surfaces and general defects) has 
made an important contribution to the record industry this year. But it 
is Cash who must be given most of the credit, ilt is he, an almost ex­
clusive Country and Western artist, who has risen above this limited 
market with a brilliant idea. It is he who has done the memorable per­
formances and given the Folsom Prison inmates a great time. The album 
is available only in stero CS 9639.
Jazz Band Tryouts
Tryouts will be held Sunday, 
Oct. 6, for the CMU Concert 
Jazz Band. The Tryouts are open 
to all students of CMU. Dennis 
Ferry, the new leader of the Jazz 
Band, has set the tryout schedule 
as follows: Trumpets-1 p.m.;
trombones-l:30 p.m.; saxophones-
2 p.m.; rhythm (Piano, guitar, 
bass ( desperately needed, by the 
way, drums, vibes, etc.) 2:30 pm. 
The auditions will be held in Fine 
Arts, Room 157 (music mezzanine). 
Writers and arrangers are also 
welcome to bring any material 
they might have.
A two to three hour rehearsal 
will be held weekly at a time 
convenient for the members of 
the band. All interested musicians 
(old members included) should 
sign the list posted on the Music 
Department (mezzanine) bulletin 
board.
In previous years the band has 
performed at Pittsburgh area 
campuses, the Three Rivers Arts 
Festival, and intercollegiate jazz 
festivals.
Composer - arranger - perform­
er Ferry has exciting plans for 
the band this year. He plans to 
take the band to at least one jazz 
festival. Also the band will most 
probably play at Three Rivers 
again, and at various Pittsburgh 
area schools. In addition to this, 
there are plans being made for 
the band to appear on Group W 
television.
If enough players are available 
small groups, made up of 5-10 
musicians, will be formed.
Any questions concerning the 
Concert Jazz Band should be di­
rected to Dennis Ferry, 441-2736, 
or by leaving a note on the music 
mezzanine bulletin board.

IN A CRISIS, it takes courage to 
be a leader . . . courage to speak out 
... to point the way ... to say, 
“Follow Me!” In a crisis, it takes 
action to survive . . . the kind of de­
cisive action that comes from a man 
of sound instinct, as well as intelli­
gence.
If America is to survive this crisis 
... if the youth of America are to 
inherit a sane and even promising 
world, wre must have courageous, 
constructive leadership. The kind of 
leadership that only George C. 
Wallace—of all Presidential can­
didates—has to offer. That’s why 
young Americans who really think 
support Wallace.
THEY KNOW that it takes cour­
age to stand up for America against 
the pseudo - intellectual professors, 
the hippies, the press and the entire 
liberal Establishment. And they’ve 
got that courage.

YOU CAN
READ 5 TIMES FASTER
with equal or better comprehension
Thousands of Reading Workshop students are proving it every day
There is nothing magical about speed reading. 
Anyone who has completed the basic reading 
skills can learn—young and old alike. And 
your comprehension, the real worth of what 
you read, is increased too. Recent research by 
the Reading Workshop has made a break­
through in increasing your reading compre­
hension beyond what was formerly possible. 
The thousands of people who have learned 
this method have proven its effectiveness. 
Eight 2 and 1/2 hour class sessions at the
Reading Workshop is all the time that's re­
quired. EVERYONE IS ASSURED SUCCESS.
The teaching staff of the Reading Workshop 
has compiled years of experience in teaching 
this course to business, industry and individual 
students. A local university hires the Reading 
Workshop to teach speed reading to their 
business and industry courses. THE SAME 
TEACHERS THAT TEACH FOR THE UNIVERSITY 
WILL BE YOUR INSTRUCTORS AT THE READ­
ING WORKSHOP.

TARTAN SPORTS
Soccer Team Tops Allegheny AlAl ghn
Wednesday, September 25, 1968—THE TARTAN—Page 9
The CMU soccer tean) in its 
first game, edged Allegheny Com­
munity College Saturday, 2-1. 
This contest, the first Tech var­
sity soccer match since 1950, was 
played in perfect weather on a 
temporary field set up in the in­
tramural area.
Most of the scoring took place 
early in the game. With only 
about two minutes gone, Allegheny 
scored the first goal. Then, thir­
teen minutes into the first quar^ 
ter, right wing Chris Escott dib­
bled deep into Allegheny territory. 
He sent a pass across to Henrik 
Palme, waiting in front of the 
Allegheny net. Palme’s shot was 
partially deflected into the net 
by Louis Rosannes to tie the 
score.
There was no scoring in the 
third quarter, as fatigue began to 
show somewhat on both teams. 
Then, with three minutes gone 
in the fourth quarter, Tech got 
its second goal when Meyer broke 
free up the left sideline, and sent 
a pass toward the center. The ball 
accidentally caromed off a defen­
der’s foot into the corner of the 
goal, just out of reach of the fran­
tically diving Allegheny goalie.
The new varsity team is an out­
growth of the soccer club formed 
last spring by interested students, 
notably Louis Rosannes and Sam 
Wiener. Organized practice un­
der coach Joseph Kruth began only 
about a week before the first game, 
and some players reported even 
later than that. The next home 
game is Saturday, September 28th, 
against St. Francis.

Rebuilding A Dynasty
by Don Baer
For the past ten years the Car­
negie Cross Country Team has had 
a tradition of excellence. Under 
the reign of Coach Carl Olson 
the team compiled a fantastic 
record of 68 wins, only eight losses 
and two ties. Even with only two 
of seven lettermen returning last 
year (and those two being injured) 
the team produced a 7-4 season 
and won the Davis Elkins Invi­
tational Meet. With only one let- 
terman gone from last year’s 
team, the 68 season looks like it 
could be a return to glory. There 
are six lettermen and several 
strong upperclassmen returning, 
but it may be the freshmen who 
steal the show.
Lead by Juan Rodriquez and in­
cluding D. Green. C. Davidson, 
J. Dziedzic, J. Kelly, J. Kilgore, 
and J. Ely (and others) the fresh­
men are letting it be known that 
the position of no upper classman 
is safe. The team has been together 
for only one week and Coach Tre- 
zise has worked the team hard so 
that we can gain a victory over 
the Grove City team that slaught­
ered us on our home course last 
year (for our first home loss in 
six years). If the early practices 
are any indication, excellence 
will remain the tradition of the 
Cross Country Team for many 
years to come and they may even 
break the 42 meet unbeaten streak 
that ran through the 1962,63,64 
& 65 seasons.

THISTLE ON SALE
BAKER HALL
C arnegi- MloU vs- arUtnUyi 
huio Uc vutoul dUUopurr
By Larry Brean
When the opening kickoff takes 
place this Saturday at Thiel Col­
lege. Carnegie will begin its 60th 
season of football. It’s hard to be­
lieve, Tech was once a football 
power that played major colleges 
and left a memorable impression 
on some of the older football fans 
throughout the country.
The first football team was 
fielded in 1906. In the very early 
years, Tech played a small college 
schedule similar to those of recent 
seasons. Until 1914, Tech had 
only one winning season, but in 
that year things started picking up 
as Judge W.P. Stetten, and later 
Robert Waddell, took over the 
coaching chores. Between 1914 
and 1932, these two men guided 
the Tartans through fourteen win­
ning seasons.
Howard Harpster was the most 
famous Carnegie player in the 
20's as he quarterbacked the Tar­
tans through some of the most 
memorable games.
In 1926, Notre Dame was 
on its way to the National title 
when they met Carnegie at Pitt 
stadium. Notre Dame was so over­
confident that Knute Rockne de­
cided to scout his next opponent 
instead of coming to Pittsburgh 
to coach his team. He left the 
team in charge of his assistant. 
Tech responded by crushing the 
Irish, 19-0.
C. I. T. had one of its greatest 
teams ever in 1928 when they fin­
ished the season with a 7 - 1 slate. 
Their victories included decisions 
over Pitt and Notre Dame. Harp­
ster was named first team All- 
American quarterback.
But it was 1938 that earned the 
most national recognition for Car­
negie Tech. Coach Bill Kern 
brought the team through its first 
two games with lopsided victories 
over Davis - Elkins and Witten­
berg.
The next game was against Holy 
Cross, winners of 14 straight and 
one of the strongest teams in the 
East. A crowd of 28,000 watched 
as quarterback Ray Carnelly 
raced 42 yards for the touchdown 
that gave Tech a 7 - 6 victory.
There was no score with ten 
minutes remaining at Notre Dame 
when a disputed fourth down play 
gave the Irish the ball at mid­
field. Notre Dame, which had 
managed only one first down all 
afternoon, scored from there in 
five plays and won 7 - 0
After beating Akron 27 - 13, 
Carnegie played one of the best 
Pitt teams ever assembled. Pitt 
was rated as the best in the na­
tion and had won 22 games in a 
row. Dr. Jock Sutherland’s Back- 
field of Marshall Goldberg, Har­
old Stebbins, Johnny Chickerneo, 
and Dick Cassiano was comparable 
to Notre Dame’s famous “Four 
Horsemen”. To top it off, Tech 
had not beaten Pitt in ten years. 
But Merlyn Condit, Whitey Lee, 
George Muha, and Ray Carnelly 
led a Tech charge which stunned 
the Panthers and a crowd of 61,-
000 with a 20 -10 upset victory.
Tech finished the 1938 season 
with a 7 -1 record and was named 
Eastern College champions. They 
played in the Sugar Bowl where 
they bowed to Texas Christian, 
15-7.
Shortly thereafter, Carnegie 
Tech de-emphasized athletics and 
has never been the football pow­
er it was in the 1920’s and 30’s. 
However, in the past few years, 
the Tartans have made their pre­
sence known because of some 
great players and exciting games.
The most notable Tech foot­
ball player in recent years is 
Tom Hubka. In three years, Hubka 
broke every Carnegie passing 
record. His ability earned him a 
tryout with the American Foot­
ball League’s Atlanta Falcons.
Football Opener at Thiel Saturday
Getto and Squires battle for QB Post
The CMU football team will go into battle against Thiel 
this Saturday with a spirited thirty-eight man squad. They will 
be faced with the formidable task of trying to avenge the 42-14 
trouncing they received by Thiel last season. The most interest­
ing of all the competitions for starting bearths is the one be­
tween Senior Larry Getto and freshman Bill Squires for the 
vital quarterback position.
Getto was All-District and hon­
orable mention All-State line­
backer last season. Currently 
Getto is working at quarterback 
on offense, a position he played 
in high school, and could open 
the season there. If he does, he 
may be the only college quarter­
back around who is an inside 
linebacker on defense. Squires, 
of McKeesport, has looked good- 
in early season practice and his 
ability to handle the job of QB. 
could free Getto for the full back 
slot thereby increasong the Tar­
tan’s offensive potency. Junior 
Kevin Wilson, second team signal 
caller last season, is also back.
Other lettermen back are Joe 
Chernay, fine flanker and split 
end from Cleveland, who led 
the team in scoring with 47 
points last season, and who along 
with Getto has been chosen a co­
captain; backs Ken Batorski, Che­
shire, Conn. Senior, Bob Healea 
(Hay-Ley), a junior from Denni­
son, Ohio, and Dave Thomas, a 
senior from Pittsburgh.
Among the’ returning linemen 
are Tony Bugel, junior tight end 
from West Mifflin, Ken Buzzard, 
sophomore guard from Murrys- 
ville, Dick Helhowski, junior 
tackle from East Vandergrift, Ron 
Horn, senior linebacker from Gar­
rett Park, Md., Denny Morabito, 
junior guard from Avonmore, 
Roger Ohlson, junior tackle from 
Kingston, N.Y., John Slatosky, 
junior center from West Newton, 
Terry Stalker, senior tackle from 
Des Moines, Iowa, and Rudy Tep- 
sic, junior end from Slovan, Pa.
Head Coach Joe Gasparella ex­
pects the team to be stronger de­
fensively with the return of that 
unit intact. While only four let­
termen were lost through gradua­
tion, four others Denny Weakland, 
Bill Scatteragia, Paul Zugates, and 
Gene Giarnelli will not return 
because of academic or personal 
reasons.
Gasparella is extremely pleased 
with the group of freshmen. In 
addition to Squires, halfback Tom 
Lombardo, from Central Catholic 
may have a shot at landing a back- 
field post.
Along the line, Gasparella has 
more size among his freshmen 
than he has ever had at CMU. 
Those rated as fine prospects in­
clude Bob Zeman, a 62”, 236 
pound tackle from Mt. Pleasant; 
Gary Meilahn, a 5’10”, 240 pound 
tackle from Pompano, Fla.; Mike 
Conrad, a 6’3”, 205 pound end 
from Pittsburgh; and Scott Cal­
vert, 6T\ 205 pound center also 
from Pittsburgh. Several other of 
the freshmen have also shown 
promise in early drills according 
to the Tartan coach.
Currently he is one of the assist­
ing coaches of this year’s CMU 
team while completing his five- 
year Architecture course.
Hubka’s favorite target, Dick 
Bell, broke every receiving re­
cord at CMU. Larry Getto last 
year was named All-District 
linebacker and is back for his 
last season.
CMU pulled the biggest upset 
of the 1967 small college season 
as they outscored previously un­
beaten Westminster, 41 - 34. 
Westminster entered the game 
with the best defense in the NAIA, 
but Tom Hubka’s five touchdown 
passes led the Tartan’s to victory 
a week after Westminster received 
notice in Time Magazine.
So, although the “Golden Years” 
of Carnegie Tech football have 
passed, there is still plenty of 
color and excitement remaining 
when a Carnegie team steps onto 
the gridiron.
