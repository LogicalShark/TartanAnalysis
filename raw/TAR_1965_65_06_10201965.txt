In a Student Congress meeting held October 12, the members dis­
cussed the possibility of financial loss that may result from Home­
coming 1965.
Because the loss would most likely be due to the un-expected an­
nouncement of a four day weekend for President Stever's Inaugura­
tion, Dick Elder, president of Student Congress, reported that 
the Administration replied favorably on covering the loss.
All Student Congress members 
were asked to encourage atten­
dance of as many students as pos­
sible to the open inaugural events.
Elder stressed the necessity of 
students interested in the athletic 
policy at Carnegie Tech to contact 
him or the Tech Committee and 
urged members to support Ope­
ration Match on campus.
George Brown, on behalf of the 
General Campus Committee, an­
nounced that the Student Con­
gress bulletin board might not be 
ready until Thanksgiving. The Fi­
nance Committee Chairman, Will 
Anderson, requested that the 
budget forms that were sent out be 
refunded as soon as possible. He 
also stated that inquiries were 
being made about the installa­
tion of candy and coke machines 
in the various school buildings.
Joe Nirschl announced the de­
cision by the Campus Chest Com­
mittee for the allocation of the 
funds received from the drive.
One-third will be given to the World 
University Service, one - third 
to Financial Aid of any worthy stu­
dents; one - third to National Scho­
larship Service for Negro students.
He explained that donors who are 
dissatisfied with these three 
choices, may check the following 
on their envelopes; The American 
Field Service, Ernie Davis Leu­
kemia Fund and / or Korean Wel­
fare Boys Town Children Hospital.
Joe also reported that any pro­
ceeds above the cost of the W. &
J. football game would be delegat­
ed to Campus Chest.
George Vajda moved that the 
pep-rally on Thursday of Home­
coming be an all - school event 
and his motion was passed.
Will Anderson moved that the 
Constitution be retabled until the 
next meeting. This motion was al­
so passed.

Two major administrative appointments have been announced by Dr. H. Guyford Stever, president, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, following action by Carnegie Tech’s Board of Trustees.
Dr. Erwin R. Steinberg, dean of Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, has been named as dean of the 
Division of Humanities and Social Sciences replacing Dr. John R. Coleman, who will leave Carnegie 
Tech at the end of this month to join the Ford Foundation. Dr. Robert J. Kibbee, formerly a special assistant 
to the president, has been named as Vice President for Planning.
Dean Steinberg will hold a dual 
deanship in Humanities and Social 
Sciences in Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College. According to 
Edward R. Schatz, vice president 
for academic affairs at Carnegie 
Tech, the appointment “reflects 
a continuing trend which has seen 
stronger ties develop between the 
Division of Humanities and Social 
Sciences and MMCC including
several joint appointments of
faculty in the two areas. Current­
ly, almost two-thirds of all cour­
ses offered in MMCC are taught 
by faculty members from the 
Division of Humanities and Social 
Sciences, and recently Carnegie 
Tech established a B.A. program 
for women in the college, which 
includes majors in the humani­
ties and social sciences.”
According to President Ste­
ver, Dr. Kibbee's appointment 
“reemphasizes the need of every 
college and university in the coun­
try, especially those of a private 
nature, to spend more time analy­
zing the future and developing far- 
reaching plans so that the uni­
versity may grow in an orderly 
and controlled manner.”
Dean Steinberg has been at Car­
negie Tech since 1946 and was 
appointed Dean of Margaret Mor­
rison Carnegie College in 1960. 
In 1963 - 64, he was Coordinator 
of the national Project English 
sponsored by the U.S. Office of 
Education. He has held offices 
in many professional organiza­
tions, is a past member of the 
executive committee of the Na­
tional Council of Teachers of Eng­
lish and a member of the Modern 
Language Association.
A recognized authority on the 
problems of women's education 
in modern society, he has been re­
sponsible for several studies in 
that area, which have resulted 
in the creation of new programs 
aimed at providing women with 
grown families the opportunity of 
returning to MMCC for training 
aimed at increasing and updating 
their professional skills, and also 
for establishing an honors pro­
gram for advanced undergraduate 
students.

Burns Talks On Management
In Fairless Lecture Series
3td OSrH OYdons 2ly GCsdTg
Dr. Arthur F. Burns, president of the National Bureau of Economic 
Research, will deliver the third annual series of Benjamin F. Fairless 
Memorial Lecture on October 26. November 2 and 9, at Carnegie Tech.
The general subject of the lec­
tures will be “The Management 
of Prosperity." They will discuss 
“Our Longest Expansion,* "The 
Problems of Unemployment,* and 
“Some Pathways to Stable Pros­
perity.”
The lectures, made possible by 
an endowed fund established 
through contribution by companies 
in the steel and other industries, 
were established to honor the for­
mer chairman of the board of 
United States Steel. Each year they 
deal with subjects of business ad­
ministration, economics, relation­
ships between business and gov­
ernment, management and labor, 
or any subject related to the theme 
of preserving economic freedom, 
human liberty, and the strengthen­
ing of individual enterprise.
Dr. Burns received his under­
graduate and graduate degrees 
from Columbia University where
he has also served as a member 
of the faculty. He has been active 
in business affairs, business re­
search, government, and educa­
tion, for many years, and from 
1953-1956, he was chairman of 
the President’s Council of Eco­
nomic Affairs.

The Woman's Athletic Associa­
tion (WAA) at Carnegie Tech is 
an organization open to all women 
students. It’s function is to get 
lots of girls active in sports to 
keep them physically fit, and to 
provide a means for relieving the 
tension of the day.
All WAA members are requir­
ed to participate in at least one 
sport, which meets two or three 
times a week for an hour or two. 
This fall, the two big sports are 
hockey and swimming. The hockey 
team is managed by Meg Esta- 
brook, sophomore scienced, and 
coached by Jane Fisk of the phy­
sical education faculty. On Satur­
day, it participated in an all day 
hockey meet at Slippery Rock 
State Teacher's College along with 
six others schools. Monday there 
was a meet with Chatham, and 
yesterday one was held against 
Waynesburg.
Swimming this year will include 
a water ballet in January, perfor­
med by the Tarquins, the synchro­
nized swimming team. As yet, 
the theme is undecided. In March 
there will be a swim meet with 
several Pittsburgh colleges - in­
cluding Duquesne, Slippery Rock, 
Point Park, Pitt, Fenn, and Kent 
State. There is a possibility of 
having intramural swimming if 
different groups express interest.
In addition, other sports can 
be started if enough people create 
a demand for them. The transfer 
from one sport to another can be 
easily accomplished by speaking 
with the gym instructors.
This semester the WAA dis­
tributed little blue paper “Do Not 
Disburb” signs to Morewood wom­
en. These signs listed WAA sports 
such as tennis, horseback-riding, 
movement education.
The WAA invites all girls to 
participate in its activities.

zISClySoTs
An Action Congress?
The Student Congress has tabled the motion for the adoption of the 
revised constitution at three successive meetings after the one at which 
the motion was initially presented. The controversial nature of this docu­
ment has proved to be such that the congress members believed they 
needed more time during which to study and understand more completely 
its structure.
This, of course, is a healthy and proper attitude for the congress mem­
bers to adopt, for a matter which so directly affects the future opera­
tion and success of the student government cannot be treated lightly. 
The Tartan, in fact, on two occasions during this period of debate, 
presented editorial statements advocating the rejection of the revised 
constitution.
At the last meeting of congress, however, the motion for adoption 
was listed as the last item of congress business to be discussed. All 
other matters which came before the congress were given precedence 
over the constitution, a vitally important subject which cannot bear 
more directly on the operation of student government; a matter which 
has been pending action since the first meeting of the congress. The 
other items on the floor of congress took so much time, time which was 
far out of proportion to their importance, that the constitution was vir­
tually ignored.
There was no discussion, no call to question, nothing. The only action 
which was taken with regard to it was the mere formality of tabling the 
motion for the third time.
It appears that the congress has lost interest in this matter. No 
member questioned the chairman’s relegation of the constitution to the 
end of the agenda, a move which seems oddly inconsistent with the 
chairman’s supposed enthusiasm for student government, which he ex­
pressed in a statement prepared in conjunction with the president of 
the Exeucitve Council, and which was recently published on the editorial 
page of the Tartan. No one asked why the motion was not discussed fur­
ther; no one demanded that it be called to question.
Neither the congress nor its chairman seem willing to take defi­
nitive action with regard to the revised constitution.
In its editorial of October 6, the Tartan stated that the motion for adop­
tion “calls for the establishment of a special subcommittee under the 
Rules Committee of Student Congress to establish* a completely revised 
constitution to satisfy the present, and in so far as possible, future 
needs of the Student Body.’ Such a constitution would be adopted by 
the spring of this academic year . . . But no purpose can be served by 
establishing a new constitution now, when that constitution will be re­
placed again in less than one academic year. It would certainly make 
more sense to establish a constitutional subcommittee under the pre­
sent government . . . . ”
This reluctance to take action on the part of the congress indicates 
that it concurs with the Tartan's opinion.
The congress must not shirk its responsibility to act on the proposed 
revision of the constitution. Rather, it must reject it, and authorize the 
constitutional subcommittee to draw up a completely revised constitu­
tion for student government.
Since congress has recognized the deficiencies of the present con­
stitution, it now has the obligation to present the student body with an 
entirely revised and viable framework for government.
Congratulations!
The Carnegie Tech Tartan extends its sincere congratulations to Dr. 
Horton Guyford Stever on the occasion of his inauguration as fifth presi­
dent of Carnegie Tech.
His concern with “interaction at the student level” has already 
wrought marked, progressive changes in the administrative policies 
of Carnegie Tech. The Tartan anticipate his continued success and wish­
es him a fruitful term of office; for.upon the impact of his achievements 
depends the future prosperity of Carnegie Tech.

Afternoon At The Movies
The scene was the Federal 
Building in downtown Pittsburgh. 
The cast was large and varied. 
Some of the characters looked as 
if they came directly from the 
bread lines, others from the col­
lege campus, and others could not 
be categorized into any reference 
group. The director was Frank 
Goldsmith, from the Pennsylvania 
Committee to end the war in Viet­
nam, and his cast put on a per­
formance worthy of applause.
Their rendition of «‘Down by the 
Riverside” and “We Shall Over­
come” were better than many 
vaudeville performances that 
America has ever seen. Some of 
their signs showed a demonstra­
tion of high imaginative ability. 
“Peace or Pieces,” “War on Po­
verty, not people,” «‘Peace means 
famility security,” and “Johnson 
got the vote, but Goldwater won the 
election” were but a few of their 
attempts to communicate their 
ideas.
Speaking of ideas, the cast seem­
ed to lack any definite ideas con­
cerning their parts. (Maybe they 
missed their cues from the direc­
tor.) Goldstein argued that Ameri­
can soldiers are guilty of war cri­
mes under the articles of the Ge­
neva convention. It is unfortunate, 
however, that the forces we are 
combating have never signed the 
Geneva treaty, and it would be 
extremely difficult to convince 
them to abide by this set of rules. 
The whole group failed to realize 
the consequences of a drastic 
switch in American policy toward 
Vietnam. If the United states aban­
doned Vietnam now, the country 
would definitely become Commu­
nist-dominated. The demonstra­
tors may have had a valid point 
that the United States should never 
have become involved in Vietnam; 
but their position advocating with­
drawal now is unrealistic.
The performance took place all
KKG Officers
The Carnegie Tech chapter of 
Kappa Kappa Gamma social so­
rority has announced the election 
of Its officers for the academic 
year 1965066.
The new officers are Ann P. 
Smith, president; Joan Q. Jaques, 
vice president; Patricia A. Bon­
ner, second vice president; Donna 
-L Horton, recording secretary; 
Maureen E. Pratt, corresponding 
secretary» and Marcia J. Grata, 
treasurer.
over the world. Over 300,000 char­
acters took part in over 38 coun­
tries. There was well over 150,- 
000 in the United States alone. 
These demonstrators were not 
alone. Counter-demonstrations fa­
ced them throughout the world. 
In Pittsburgh, however, the de­
monstrators advocating withdraw­
al from Vietnam outnumbered the 
others by two to one.
It is ironic that both groups 
of demonstrators were different 
in many ways and yet similar in a 
very important way. Even though 
the clothes, facial expressions, 
and manner of expression were all 
different, the lack of definite ideas 
about the issues was the all im­
portant similarity. The counter­
demonstration was different only in 
that it opposed the Vietnam march­
ers. These people felt it was their 
duty to counter-march to dem­
onstrate that they were good Am­
ericans and that the position of 
the others was un-American. Their 
position, however, was not defend­
ed well by their director, Bert 
Lewis, chairman of the Western 
Pennsylvania Young Americans for 
Freedom. He felt that his conser­
vative political action group should 
keep «‘the lunatic fringe of libe­
rals from dictating government to 
the majority.” However, he didn't 
seem too concerned about Viet­
nam.
The whole performance was very 
confusing. A bystander, in fact, re­
marked to me that he had diffi­
culty in distinguishing what each 
group represented. Two similar 
movies . . . similar plot ... simi­
lar characters . . . little signifi­
cance.
Students Receive 
Chemistry Award
Guy M. Bradley, senior Che­
mistry, and Joseph D. Bowman, 
senior chemistry, were award­
ed the Lubrizol Foundation Award 
for 1965 - 66.
Bradley and Bowman were se­
lected to receive the award by the 
faculty in the department of che­
mistry on the basis of scholastic 
performance and professional pro­
mise.
Bradley is a member of the Kil­
tie Band, the Cameron Choir, 
and Alpha Phi Omega, a national 
service fraternity.
Bowman is a member of the 
Student Congress and PI Kappa 
Alpha, social fraternity.
Salinger Speaks 
At Tech Campus
PSdyyd OoTSHrdy

a9 Pdrr9 O,lTdH
««Steve Allen is running for Con­
gress and Pierre Salinger is going 
to take over Bob Hope’s job.” 
The October 12 assembly illus­
trated to the student body Pierre 
Salinger's informative and yet in­
formal manner of speech presen­
tation.
Salinger's topic was the rela­
tions between the president and the 
press; the problems which exist 
and the profits which can be ob­
tained from a well organized press 
system.
He stated that a perfect system 
does not exist at this time. He 
said the main reason for the im­
perfections is the clash between the 
president and press on the topic 
of national security. The press 
naturally wants to get all infor­
mation possible but the president 
tries to keep the necessary in­
formation quiet. An example cited 
was the Cuba missile crisis.
Salinger then told of the time he 
was flying over France and Dean 
Rusk, secretary of state called 
him and said, «‘Pierre, could you 
stop by my office for a minute?' 
Mr. Salinger replied, «‘Do you 
know where I am (He was in an 
airplane over the Atlantic.)
In more serious tones Salinger 
told of the evening of President 
Kennedy's death when he had sat 
up until 6 a.m. talking with Dean 
Rusk. At 8 a.m. he received a 
phone call. «*Hello Mr. Salinger, 
this is the president.” It took him 
a moment to understand the state­
ment. He realized the tremendous 
organization of the United States 
government in that it could give 
responsibility to another as soon 
as it did.

Workshop For Protest
Last Friday night our quest for 
amusement took us to the Vietnam 
Workshops at Pitt. A strange 
assortment of political activists 
provided the entertainment. The 
meeting was called to order, and 
the controversial Professor Rob­
ert Colodny was introduced.
The action started when two tele­
vision photographers covering the 
event were evicted. Dr. Colodny's 
keynote Address rehashed the left­
ist arguments presented at pre­
vious Teach-ins. The moderator 
asked the crowd to break up into 
three discussion groups, when 
a loudmouth in the rear insisted 
on answering Dr. Colodny’s re­
marks immediately. Before he was 
quieted down he had produced two 
large Marine and Navy recruiting 
posters and a sign reading “Let's 
Stop the Commies." Most of us 
stayed in this room anticipat­
ing more of the same, while a 
handful left to form the other two 
groups. We were not disappointed. 
Between interruptions by the pla­
card - carrying anti - communist, 
other characters presented their 
opinions.
One wasClemmie Stubbs, Edi­
tor of The Agitator and protestor 
of nearly everything. The laugh­
ter had just died down from his 
concluding remark: “I'm not red, 
you can see I'm quite black" when 
a little old lady in the back of 
the room rose and in the best 
Norman Thomas tradition deman­
ded to know what was wrong with 
Socialism. Apparently no one 
thought anything was wrong with
socialism, so we logically went on 
to the Negro's stake in Vietnam. 
From among the standees a splen­
didly bearded gentleman repri­
manded the crowd for wasting 
time in discussion when they should 
be urging Negro youths to refuse 
to fight in a rascist war against 
other non-whites. The Wall Street 
Conspiracy, of course, was drag­
ged out again, with Big Business, 
Pentagonians, and Munitions mak­
ers taking their lumps.
Despite the clarity of the argu­
ments previously presented one 
student confessed to be confused. 
A veteran of Berkeley demonstra­
tions, he nevertheless had reser­
vations about joining next day's 
picketing. With pleading eyes and 
voice, he sought advice and in the 
spirit of the meeting was told to 
picket, not to picket, and to con­
tinue vascillating. He was still 
shaking his head in indecision when 
we left the meeting.
But the next day when we ar­
rived at the Federal Building we 
found our political Hamlet lead­
ing the anti-war picketers in chants 
and songs. At the other end of the 
sidewalk another group, compos­
ed largely of Young Americans 
for Freedom, carried signs favor­
ing U.S. policy in Vietnam. We 
joined the latter and marched three 
quarters of an hour until overcome 
by thirst. Over drafts in a nearby 
bar we agreed this had been much 
like all demonstrations - fervently 
confused, with as many causes as 
demonstrators - united for the 
moment by the thought of action.

Mississippi Police State
Mississippi to me is a police state. In Jackson there are over 400 
police not counting game and fish commissioners who act as police. 
They have cage trucks to transport their human cattle. The motorcycle 
police have rifles on their cycles that can be used cowboy style.
Note the case of Mj, a colored man in early twenties.Tie was picked 
up for drunkenness while not drunk. While in jail, he was tried and con­
victed of a crime—simple theft—that was committed while he was In 
jail. The judge sentenced him to 90 days in jail and a $250 fine. MJ 
served his 90 days but did not have the money to pay the fine. The police 
generously let him work it off by working 16 hours a day cleaning cells 
at a dollar a day. This is 6-l/4£ an hour plus an occasional beating. 
When MJ gets out he will have served 340 days for a crime he didn't 
commit, a crime for which a white man would have been acquitted.
It makes me think that there is justice only for those that can afford 
it. A good lawyer can get you more justice than a bad one and a bad 
one can at least prevent you from getting beaten while you serve your 
time. Those who can afford it pay the fine, those who cannot are at the 
mercy of the police. TTiere is no justice involved—just what you can 
or cannot afford. Of course, color is also important when one speaks 
of justice in America.
Justice is expensive. It has taken over 1200 arrests; $200,000 In 
bail money; people being beaten, falling sick due to malnutrition and 
filthy living conditions to alter two laws (that are in direct violation to 
the Constitution) in a single city—Jackson, Mississippi. For the first 
time in over 100 years, people in Jackson can eitfoy some of the rights 
as guaranteed them under the First Amendment.
Amendment I of our Constitution provides that “Congress shall make 
no law... (preventing) people peaceably to assembly and to petition the 
government for a redress of grievances." It was such a mission to 
petition the government that prompted us to march. Jackson’s laws on 
marching were in direct violation of the United States Constitution.
On June 30, 1965, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 
granted the FDP's motion for an injunction. The injunction issued by 
the Fifth Circuit prohibits police authorities in the city of Jackson from:
(1) enforcing in the future the ordinances restricting parades and 
handbills.
(2) interfering with the rights of demonstrators to peacefully distribute 
handbills about the FDP and engage in like activities and peacefully 
walk two abreast on the sidewalks observing all traffic signals; walking 
as close to the building line as possible so as not to Interfere with or 
obstruct pedestrians.
Warner Heads 
New Program
In Education
A new organization - the In­
stitute for service to Education - 
will administer a pre-college pro­
gram for promising but under­
privileged high school students.
Dr. John C. Warner, chairman 
of the institute, is former presi­
dent of Carnegie Tech.
Sargent shriver, director of the 
Office of Economic Opportunity 
(OEO), announced the signing Oc­
tober 6 of a contract for $935,- 
738 with the institute for the first 
year's operation of Project Upward 
Bound.
The institute has headquarters 
in Washington and is operated 
by a board of 14 directors from 
the academic world including Rich­
ard Dr. Strathmeyer, vice presi­
dent for business affairs at Car­
negie Tech.
Mr. Shriver said the institute 
will begin immediately to evaluate 
proposals from colleges.
He said about 25,000 high school 
students will be enrolled the first 
year. They will take courses ad­
ministered by 200 to 250 colleges 
across the country.
“Upward Bound has the same 
potential to strike at the roots of 
poverty that sparked so much en­
thusiasm for pre - school Head 
Start programs this summer," 
Mr. Shriver said.
He said the program would help 
students from poverty backgrounds 
to attend and complete college.
The institute is an outgrowth of 
a committee formed by the Ameri­
can Council on Education in 1963 
to seek college opportunities for 
deprived youths.
Carnegie Tech has operated 
such a program for the past two 
summers, supported mainly by 
funds from the Carnegie Corp.
The University of Pittsburgh 
used money from Pittsburgh foun­
dations to start a similar program 
last summer.
ASIA Exams
Written examinations for The 
United States Information Agency 
and The State Department Foreign 
Service will be held on Saturday, 
December 4, at various locations 
throughout the country.
Those interested should file 
their applications before October 
18 with The Board of Examiners 
for The Foreign Service, Depart­
ment of State, Washington, D.C.
Playhouse Repertory Theatre 
Gives Professional Practice
“TTie Carnegie Tech/Playhouse Company* was established in Pitts­
burgh as a natural outgrowth of a less official exchange of directors 
and instructors between Carnegie Tech and the Pittsburgh Playhouse. 
It has provided a unique repertory theatre program and an educational 
plan for participants.
William Ball and his Ameri­
can Conservatory Theatre Found­
ation will continue to serve in the 
repertory theatre until December. 
Ball is a nationally famous di­
rector and a graduate of Car­
negie Tech, holding both bachelor 
and master of Fine Arts in drama. 
He has directed such acclaimed 
productions as Moliere's “Tart­
uffe" in Lincoln Center, New York.
In March, 1965, he directed “A 
Hommage to Shakespeare" star­
ring Sir John Gielgud, Dame Edich 
Evans and Margaret Leighton.
Ball has been recipient of a Ford 
Foundation Grant, a Fulbright 
Scholarship in England and an 
RCA/NBC Director’s Fellowship.
Administrative officers of the 
company are Earle R. Gister of 
Carnegie Tech and William H. 
Ford, president of the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse. At it’s founding Gister 
explained the reasons for the crea­
tion of this unique company. “It 
will serve as an outlet for drama 
graduates, providing for techni­
cians, designers and actors with a 
certain amount of security, pro­
ducing quality plays. Thete is no 
other theatrical idea like this in
the country.* He continued, “After 
graduation, drama students are us­
ually thrown into the theatrical 
world to prove themselves while 
gaining experience and learning 
through osmosis. The Carnegie 
Tech/Playhouse Company will 
provide graduates with the ex­
perience of playing in quality pro­
ductions before a paying audience. 
Added to the excitement of pro­
ducing four or five different {days 
in a week. Presently 10 to 12 
Carnegie graduates are involved In 
the program.*
Dr. Gister also expressed a 
belief that a professional resi­
dent company is a necessity in a 
city like Pittsburgh. “It constitutes 
a movement away from New York 
as the only place one can see 
quality theatre."
The company is financed through 
box office receipts, subsidies, 
grants and gifts. To succeed, the 
company needs public support. 
Plays produced so far include 
“Tartuffe," “Tiny Alice," “Anti­
gone," “ Servant of Two Masters,* 
“King Lear," “Noah," “Six Char­
acters in Search of an Author," and 
“Rose Tattoo.*

Nature^Of^The^JUm
Bern Discusses Aspects 
Of University Politics
Although it is still clothed in its academic sheep’s clothing, the univer­
sity is increasingly becoming an active political animal, a political 
animal, moreover, that sometimes bites the legislative or alumni, 
hand that feeds it. Whether one looks at the university as an institution, 
at its administrative officers, its teaching staff, or its student body, it 
seems clear that the university is becoming one of the leading agents 
of social change in America.
Proctor and Gamble Honor 
Four Scholarship Winners
a9 3l, fllyd
Four Carnegie Tech students were honored at a dinner held in Skibo 
on the Carnegie Tech campus last week. They are: Michael K. Capko, 
senior, physics; Joseph H. Orens, junior, electrical engineering; 
Joseph N. Weber, sophomore, chemistry; and Franklin L. Thicroff,
Consider first the university 
as an institution. The growing po­
litical involvement of the universi­
ty is now unmistakable as it ac­
tively pushes its local community 
on urban renewal, slum clearance, 
and racial integration.
Nor is today’s university afraid 
to use its considerable economic 
power as well; some universities 
forbid their students to rent apart­
ments from landlords who discri­
minate on racial grounds. It is no 
longer unusual for universities to 
send lobbyists to state legislatur­
es to testify in behalf of social 
legislation, like fair housing laws, 
which have little to do with the 
curricular or financial affairs of 
the university. Universities are 
increasingly willing to clash with 
state and local officials and their 
own alumni over matters of book 
censorship and academic free­
dom as well.
PylI!bSHr OlbSoT itoHrd
Much of the university’s most ef­
fective political activity is not 
quite so overt, but it is political 
activity nevertheless for it is 
aimed directly at producing social 
change. I refer here to one of the 
university’s favorite “extracur- 
ricular activities,” the training of 
social change agents. Consider, 
for example, the fact that the uni­
versity is the major training 
ground for Peace Corps Volun­
teers. I am certain that the very 
congressmen who so eagerly vote 
the funds for the Peace Corps 
would be given pause if they sat in 
on some of the training lectures 
concerning American Foreign po­
licy; such training, given by uni­
versity personnel, rarely follows 
the official Washington line all the 
way. The political implications of 
Peace Corps training are not so 
hard to discern, but there are even 
more subtle extracurricular acti­
vities engaged in by today’s uni­
versity that must be considered 
political in the broad sense. For 
the past two summers Carnegie 
Tech has run special training pro­
grams for history teachers from 
predominately Negro colleges; 
another special training program 
has been designed for cultural­
ly deprived Pittsburgh high school 
students. This year there is a 
group of Southern Negro college 
graduates who are simultaneously 
taking a graduate program at Car­
negie Tech and learning how to di­
rect and»participate in community 
action programs.
zI!boClys SH 1ostSHrClH 
The University as an institu­
tion is not the only political agent 
emerging from the campus. The 
airplanes from academia to Wash­
ington are increasingly clogged 
with university administrators and 
faculty taking extended leaves 
of absence to “advise” the Ameri­
can people on how to run their af­
fairs. From now on it will be every 
American president, not just the 
occasional intellectual one, who 
will assemble a university brain 
trust on his staff. It was univer­
sity-based economic advisers — 
including some of Carnegie Tech 
— who have “sold” the present 
administration on the merits of de­
ficit financing. A Carnegie Tech 
professor has investigated some of 
the problems involved in urging 
underdeveloped nations to accept 
birth control devices. This past 
year, two of us on the faculty were 
asked to advise the Army on how 
to deal with psychological pro­
blems arising between American
armed forces and the Vietnamese 
political leaders and popula­
tion.
The government is also receiv­
ing advice from the campuses it has 
not asked for; The now famous 
Teach-In technique has provided 
a totally new debate across the 
nation on American foreign policy 
accompanied by some very sharp, 
sometimes nasty, exchanges be­
tween government officials and 
university professors. An Inter­
national Teach-In was held in To­
ronto just two weeks ago, and you 
may be sure that the administra­
tion in Washington was listening 
and watching carefully. The ivory 
tower is no longer shrouded in 
clouds of unapplied intellectual 
speculation; it is becoming a force 
of politics.
OC!IdHC PlTSCSbSoHs
Like the university as an insti­
tution and like its faculty, the uni­
versity student has also re-en­
tered the political arena after the 
apathetic decade of the Fifties. 
Student involvement began with the 
Sit-In movement in 1960, expand­
ed into the Freedom Rides, orga­
nized itself into groups like CORE 
and SNCC, and has now fanned from 
civil rights across the entire poli­
tical spectrum from the Young Am­
ericans for Freedom on the con­
servative side through the liberal 
Students for a Democratic socie­
ty to the reactivated socialist clubs 
on the left. Almost every campus 
now has at least one ad hoc com­
mittee on Vietnam, Cuba, or the 
Dominican Republic.
This, then, is the increasingly 
prominent and important facet of 
the university community, its role 
as a social change agent. The meek 
may eventually inherit the earth, 
but it will almost certainly be the 
college - educated who will have
determined what it will look like.
Students from our technical
schools in particular will be mov­
ing into positions of political pow­
er, and will be finding themselves 
unwitting agents of social, not
just technological change whether 
they savor the task or not.
UHoXoydHdss
And yet, unfortunately, because 
this facet of the university has not 
been formalized into the curricu­
lum or explicitly included in the 
more traditional extracurricular 
activities, students can and do 
complete their university years 
without even becoming aware of its 
existence. This is particularly true 
at technical schools — Carnegie 
Tech included — where only a mi­
nority of students choose to ex­
pose themselves to this bustle 
of activity. To avail himself of the 
tremendous potential of the uni­
versity in this area, the student 
does not have to run register 
voters in Mississippi or even pic­
ket in Pittsburgh. The student 
at Carnegie Tech is given the 
opportunity to tutor culturally de­
prived children once a week. At 
the very least the Carnegie Tech 
student can read Section 4 of the 
Sunday “New York Times” or lis­
ten to an occasional newscast. 
Doing just that, he will discover 
the political aspects of the univer­
sity leaping into prominence 
whereas his less informed class­
mates will be completely obli­
vious to them.
Sometime during his career 
every student is advised not to

NSF To Present 
Grad Fellowships
The National science Foundation 
plans to offer approximately 1000 
summer fellowships to graduate 
teaching assistants to be tenable 
in the summer of 1966.
The purpose of the program is

in the United States.
These awards will provide sup­
port to selected graduate teach­
ing assistants of high ability in or­
der to enable them to devote full 
time to their own scientific studies 
or research during the summer 
months.
Awards of these fellowships will 
be made for study or work lead­
ing to masters’ or doctoral de­
grees in the mathematical, phy­
sics, medical, biological, or en­
gineering sciences; anthropology; 
economics; geography; the his­
tory and philosophy of science, 
and linguistics; political science; 
psychology; and sociology.
Application for Summer Fel­
lowships for Graduate Assistants

Dr. Hamerschlag was elected 
as Director of the college in 1903. 
At that time he was a well - 
known figure in New York City 
industrial education work. In 1918 
his title was changed to President 
and under his guidance Carnegie 
Tech was created physically and 
established itself educationally. 
Withdrawing from his educational 
interests in 1922, Dr. Hamerschlag 
took up his private practice as an 
engineering consultant. Soon af­
ter the first president’s death in 
1927 a commemorative speech was 
given by his life-long friend, Dr. 
Frederick Paul Keppel, then presi­
dent of the Carnegie Corporation 
and former assistant secretary of 
war under Woodrow Wilson. Said 
Dr. Keppel: “In many ways it 
(the appointment of President 
Hamerschlag) was a strange 
choice. He was young, he was 
untried in work of that kind, his 
formal educational preparation had 
been slight. But Andrew Carnegie, 
among his other great qualities, 
had the quality of picking men ...
I appreciate the opportunity this
occasion offers me to pay tribute 
to the memory, not of a paragon 
of all academic virtues, but of a 
brilliant mind, a picturesque and 
stimulating personality, and to me 
of a very dear friend.”
Thomas Stockham Baker assum­
ed the presidency of Carnegie Tech 
in 1923. Hie principle achieve­
ments of his administration were, 
according to Tarbell's The Story of 
Carnegie Tech, the establishment 
of a definite research program, the 
sponsorship of three international 
coal conferences and the Coal Re­
search Laboratory, a closer rela­
tionship and understanding between 
the institution and the community, 
and the merger of the College of 
Industries with the College of En­
gineering.
Robert E. Doherty assumed the 
presidency of Carnegie Tech in 
1936.
In a 1964 farewell address to 
students, Dr. John Christian War­
ner said this about him: “In four­
teen years, although his efforts 
were hampered by four years of 
war, Dr. Doherty had converted a
‘know-what’ undergraduate pro­
gram into a ‘know-what’ and a 
‘know-why* program. He had sown 
the seeds of high quality, and they 
were beginning to flower. Presi­
dent Doherty had a vision of Car­
negie as a first-class educational 
institution and asa center of learn­
ing ... By revolutionizing the un­
dergraduate program, firmly es­
tablishing the importance of huma­
nities and social sciences in the 
education of professional men and 
women, and by placing a proper 
emphasis upon quality, Doherty 
had moved Carnegie Tech into the 
forefront as an undergraduate in­
stitution in the professional fields 
represented here."
Dr. Warner, himself, came to 
Carnegie Tech in 1926 and quick­
ly went through the ranks becom­
ing professor and head of the che­
mistry department, a position he 
held until 1949 when he was appoint­
ed vice president and president - 
elect. He also served as dean of 
graduate studies from 1945 until 
1950.
During his administration, Car­
negie Tech experienced its great­
est physical growth. Fourteen 
buildings were constructed. A de­
velopment program, which was 
begun in 1957 with a goal of $29,-
000,000, had raised $26,000,000 of 
that total in the fall of 1964. Dr. 
Warner also raised faculty sala­
ries over 100% during his term.

Peter Hines Wyckoff 
Heads Weather Modification
Peter Hines Wyckoff, one of the country’s most prominent atmos­
pheric physicists, is the director of the Weather Modification Pro­
gram of the Natural Science Foundation.
Wyckoff was born in New York City on June 1, 1913. He attended Car­
negie Tech from 1932-6 and received his bachelors degree in electrical 
engineering. The following year he was awarded his masters in the 
same field by the California Institute of Technology.
After receiving his degree he 
accepted an appointment as a re-; 
search engineer at Westinghouse 
Research Labs in Pittsburgh.
World War n temporarily in­
terrupted his civilian career.;
From 1941-46 he served in the U.S.:
Army Signal Corps as a Lt. Colo­
nel in Research and Development.
He spent fourteen months in Eng-, 
land working with the British Mi­
nistry of Supply on the important, 
radar development project.
Returning to civilian life he ac-j 
cepted a position as chief of the 
Atmospheric Physics Lab at the 
Air Force Cambridge Research 
Labs. In 1960 he was named as­
sistant director of the Illi­
nois Institute of Technical Re­
search.
He left this post in 1964 to be­
come director of the Weather Mo­
dification Program, several post­
war special positions Wyckoff has 
held special significance to 
“Alumnus of the Week.” In 1950 
he traveled to an isolated island 
in the Pacific to serve as the Di­
rector of Cloud physics for Ope­
ration Greenhouse - a series of 
atomic bomb tests. From 1956 to 
1959 he was the Chief Scientist 
for the United states Air Force’s 
Rocket Program for the Inter­
national Geophysical Year. He al-' 
so served as a member of the 
National Academy of Science’s Na­
tional Committee of IGY from 
1954 - 59.

tions. He holds membership in the 
American Physical Society, the 
American Institute of Aeronautics 
and Astronautics, the American 
Association for the Advancement 
of Science, the Scientific Research

Salinger States Opinions
In Private Interview
In an October 13, Hilton hotel- 
room interview with representa­
tives of the ‘Tartan’ former pre­
sidential press secretary Pierre 
Salinger discussed his views on 
government subsidies and the arts, 
education, Vietnam, Kennedy, and 
politics.
Salinger said that he feels the 
government should use its influ­
ence to attract attention to the 
arts but not to subsidize them. 
If subsidies were concentrated in 
teaching the arts, the program 
might be beneficial.
Responding to the much debat­
ed question of whether schools and 
government place too much em­
phasis on the sciences rather than 
the fine and liberal arts - Salin­
ger felt there was an over em­
phasis on science.
With regard to the war in Viet­
nam. He listed alternatives for U.S. 
action: escalate the war; let it 
continue as it is; - - - -
The Vietnamese have time on 
their side, therefore the only 
way the U.S. can achieve peace 
is to try to convince them through 
continued opposition to come to 
the bargaining table.
His point of view regarding U. 
S. censorship in the Vietnam war 
is that it is part of battle field 
intelligence. We wouldn’t have re­
leased information important to the 
enemy in World War H. The peo­
ple do have a right to know what 
is happening. They could be given 
information at universities or civic 
meetings through government 
spokesmen or representatives of 
nation - wide businesses.
The next area discussed was in­
volvement in politics by members 
of the arts. He felt people should 
run for office who have had past 
experience in government. In the 
end, the voters are to blame for 
bad leaders. Naturally a discussion 
of the magnetism of Kennedy as a 
leader arose. Salinger stated “The 
people need an association with its 
leaders in order to make the coun­
try more personal. History will 
judge if Kennedy was a great 
leader.”
Salinger said that he will think 
hard before deciding to run for 
office again. A future government 
position, he feels would probably 
be from a presidential appoint­
ment.

I had little trouble finding a seat in Scaife Hall Auditorium at 4 p.m. 
last Wednesday. I was there to cover a story on “The Civil Rights 
Movement — Does it Have a Future?*’
Seated at the panel were three members of Carnegie Tech’s history 
department and the head of the Pittsburgh NAACP. The gallery consisted 
mostly of members of the community although several Carnegie Tech 
students were present.
Dr. Irving H. Bartlett, head of 
the department, introduced the 
first speaker, Eugene Levy. Levy 
traced the Civil Rights movement 
from the days of Reconstruction 
which saw the dispairing Negro 
isolated in the South and the com­
plaisant White willing to take ad­
vantage of his weakness. The fede­
ral government would not ally the 
Civil Rights cause of that time as 
the Negro was considered a poli­
tical handicap. Civil Rights lead­
ers admitted defeat to the adverse 
public opinion.
In the first decade of this cen­
tury the NAACP was formed with 
the goal of opening social, politi­
cal, and economic opportunities 
to the Negro. Slowly the way was 
opened so that today the Negro is 
the “master of his own fate.”
With this relative “establishment 
of power” he has forced the com­
mitment of the federal govern­
ment. This commitment along with 
a winning fight against despair and 
complaisancy will insure a future 
for Civil Rights.
Professor David Fowler, the 
second speaker, had a more 
pessimistic view. He spoke of the 
achievement of secondary aims, 
mostly since World War II, in the 
fields of education, job opportuni­
ties and property rights. He cited 
the main goal, however, as being 
respect and self respect. Projects 
such as “Head start” are alright 
for the time but do not have the 
dedication of the white communi­
ty. Fowler defined his goal of total 
respect as the day when intermar­
riage is not only accepted but com­
monplace - a day far in the future 
indeed.
The last speaker on the program 
was Mr. Brown, head of the Pitts­
burgh NAACP. He came with no 
notes, no facts nor figures. He 
simply expressed a feeling that one 
must live in order to understand.
The feeling that was the real story 
behind the demonstrations and de­
spair - the fact that (think of 
yourself in this position) “I am a 
Negro” and no matter how many 
political victories I win or how 
much money I make I am still a 
Negro and when I meet a white 
man I can see in his eyes that I 
am a Negro.
Brown could not answer specific
Tobey Exhibit 
OpenThrough 
November 5
A collection of sketches and 
paintings by Mark Tobey, winner 
of the Pittsburgh International in 
1961, will be on display in Hew­
lett Gallery, Fine Arts through 
Friday, November 5.
The exhibition entitled “Seattle 
Market Place Sketches” contains 
45 sketches of the Seattle land­
mark as well as paintings.
Tobey, 75, is now living in 
Basel, Switzerland. He lived in 
Seattle for many and turned out 
the sketches and paintings between 
1939 and 1942 after having traveled 
widely in Europe and the Orient.
His sketches were done in small 
Chinese notebooks. According to 
critics “The delicate paper proved 
especially appropriate for Tobey’s 
mood-filled expression of mar­
ket’s character and personalities 
he found there.”
From these studies, Tobey de­
veloped a series of oil and tem­
pera easel paintings, of which four 
are in the exhibition. The show was 
gathered together from 16 private 
collectors, one gallery and the 
Seattle Museum of Art and was 
organized for circulation by The 
Museum of Modern Art in New 
York.
Tobey became nationally known 
in 1944 after a one-man show was 
held at the Willard Gallery in New 
York. In 1946 he was included in 
The Museum of Modern Art’s 
’Fourteen Americans. In 1958 he 
was awarded the first prize of 
the Commune of Venice for his 
paintings at the XXIX Biennale, 
becoming the first American to 
be so honored since Whistler in 
1895. In 1962 a large exhibition 
of his work was staged by The 
Museum of Modern Art.

Rights movement, itself to him the

but an indefineable one.

Choir To Perform 
For Tech Alumni 
At Homecoming
Carnegie Tech alumni will re­
turn on Homecoming to hear a con­
cert given by the Cameron Choir.
The choir, formed 13 years ago, 
Is made up of approximately 65 
male and female singers.
Robert L. Camp, director of the 
choir, is also supervisor of music 
for the Wilklnsburg Public Schools. 
He received his master's degree 
in music at Tech in 1953. Besides 
the fact that Andrew Carnegie used 
the Cameron plaid, the students 
felt the name had the right sound, 
according to Mr. Camp.
All of the departments on Car­
negie Tech are represented in the 
choir. Auditions are held twice a 
year at the beginning of each 
semester. There are generally 
more than 60 candidates and any 
over that number are used as 
alternates to fill in when the aca­
demic schedules keep members at 
their books.
The choir usually meets twice a 
week — after regular class hours 
— in Mary Breed Hall In Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie College.
When performing for Carnegie 
Tech alumni, the choir includes a 
sing-a-long session of campus 
songs, usually reserved for the 
end of the program. The students 
give two formal concerts a year, 
usually at the end of each semester. 
They also give three or four con­
certs a year at district high 
schools.
The choir also travels for alumni 
concerts. They have performed In 
New York City, Columbus, Erie, 
Philadelphia, Hartford, Washing­
ton and Baltimore. On many of 
these trips the choir also sings 
at high schools.
They have also performed on 
radio and television. Locally, the 
Camerons have performed in Car­
negie Music Hall and Stephen Fos­
ter Memorial.
“Music is the only thing I know 
of where you can use your voca­
tion as a hobby — I do it every 
day and still love it," said Mr. 
Camp. When asked about his 
schedule, he replies: “It does make 
for a full week.*

Alumna Displays 
Watercolors 
In Hunt Library
An exhibition of more than 100 
original drawings and water colors 
of botanical illustrations by Mrs. 
Anne Ophelia Todd Dowden is on 
display at Carnegie Tech's Hunt 
Botanical Library.
The exhibition marks the first 
one-man show at Carnegie Tech of 
Botanical illustrations by an alum­
na. Mrs. Dowden graduated in 1930 
with a degree from the College of 
Fine Arts and continued her stu­
dies at the Art students League 
and the Beaux Art Institute of De­
sign in New York.
On three occasions, she was a 
Tiffany Foundation Fellow. She 
taught at Pratt Institute and was 
chairman of the art departmental 
Manhattanville College for 20 
years.
Full-color spreads of her botan­
ical illustrations have appeared in 
numerous issues of Life, Natural 
History Magazine and House Beau­
tiful. More recently she has been 
both author and illustrator of pop­
ular books specializing on such 
subjects as birds and flowers. 
Among them are Look at A Flow­
er (1963), The Secret Life of Flow­
ers 0964) and the latest Roses. 
Copies of these will be part of the 
display.
Much material of special inte­
rest to students of graphic arts 
and book design has been includ­
ed by her publisher, The Odyssey 
Press. This includes preliminary 
sketches, working drawing draw­
ings, progressive color proofs and 
ozalid prints. Not all of Mrs. 
Dowden's work will be on display.
The exhibition will be open to 
faculty, students and the public 
every Monday through Friday from 
1 to 5 p.m. until next May.
The exhibit will be open to the 
public from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. 
on Thursday, October 21 and Sat­
urday October 23.

Homecoming was happy at Grove City College last Saturday as the 
defense and rolled to a 28-0 victory overWolverines played fierce 
Carnegie Tech's Tartans.
The Grovers completely bottled 
up the usually dangerous Tech 
passing attack, limiting them to a 
gain of only 71 yards passing, 
The Tartans’ ground attack was not 
a poor one, picking up 152 yards, 
but it was not enough to push over 
a score.
The first half was almost en­
tirely a defensive struggle, with no 
scoring being done until late in the 
second quarter. The Tartans won 
the toss and chose to receive. Af­
ter an exchange of downs, the Tar­
tans began what was to be one of 
their biggest scoring threats of the 
day.
On fourth down and eight for the 
Tartans on their own 30-yard line, 
Jim Williams was brought in to 
punt. His kick was a high, 30-yard 
boot which landed among a group 
of Grove City players, but, in the 
confusion, one of the Grovers 
touched the ball and an alert Tar­
tan quickly jumped on it to re­
claim possession for Tech.
Two 7-yard gains for Larry 
Getto and a Wolverine penalty put 
the Tartans on the Grove C ity 18- 
yard line. But two Tech penalties, 
one a 15-yarder, quickly moved the 
Tartans out of scoring position and 
killed the threat.
After this both teams were un­
able to move the ball successful­
ly until late in the 2nd quarter 
when Grove City started its first 
scoring drive. After a 15-yard 
run by Thom Shear, Mike Zeigler 
tossed a 40-yard pass to his right 
end, Ken Wyman, on the Tech 21- 
yard line.
Two plays later, zeigler threw a 
20-yard aerial to Tom Behr, and, 
with Barry Ross's successful con­
version, the Wolverines led 7-0 
at the half.
In the second half, the Grovers 
quickly added another score when, 
on third down and 20 yards to go 
from their own 17 yard line, Mike 
Zeigler daringly went to the air 
and found Behr downfield. Behr 
grabbed the pass on the sidelines, 
eluded a couple of tacklers, and 
went all the way. Ross added the 
PAT and the Wolverines led 14-0.
TiiP Grovers added two more 
touchdown^ in the final quarter 
when Bob ifctwns ran the ball inÖQwns
from the Tech 1 and Russ Snead 
caught a 9-yard pass from Tom 
Philips in the end zone. Ross and 
Emil Solomon added the extra 
points to make the final score 28-0 
in favor of Grove C ity.
Individual leaders for the Wol­
verines were halfback Thom Shear 
(65 yards rushing), and quarter­
back Mike Zeigler. Zeigler only 
completed 4 passes, but they were 
good for 152 yards.
The big men on the Grove City 
team, though, were those on the de­
fensive unit. By frequent blitzing, 
they managed to keep Tom Hubka 
from throwing the long bomb and 
they stopped the Tartan ground 
attack every time it threatened.
Larry Getto and ailing Dick 
Merrill carried the ball for 34 and 
36 yards respectively for Tech.
Tech, now 1 and 3, plays host to 
Franklin and Marshall Saturday at 
1:30 in the Homecoming game. 
Last year an undefeated F & M 
team nipped Tech 18 to 14, and 
the Tartans will be out to gain 
revenge in front of the home fans.

Coming up this Friday at 1;30 
p.m. is the annual I.M. All - 
Star game. This year it will be 
changed a little; in the past it has 
always been the Eagles and Steel­
ers Leagues against the Browns 
and Giants Leagues, but this year 
the fraternity all - stars will battle 
the combined grads, dorms, and in­
dependents. This should make for a 
very interesting game.

Bethany Ties Tech 
In Cross - Country
a9 itySs foblsnl
Carnegie Tech's four-year streak of success in cross-country 
was nearly ruined this past week as a fired-up Bethany team tied the | 
Tartans 28-28 last Wednesday at Bethany.
In a triangular meet at Cleve­
land on Saturday, the Tartans ed­
ged Case Tech by a point, 27-28, 
and crushed John Carroll 18-39, 
stretching their ««undefeated'’ 
string to 40, although the ««win­
ning" streak was broken.
It was Carnegie Tech's first 
encounter with either Bethany or 
Case. Both schools were aware 
of Tech's winning streak and were 
out to break it.

Running can be psychological, 
and Bethany, a West Virginia 
cross-country power with a 50-4 
record over the last five years, 
used this to its advantage. Smart­
ing from a 24-31 upset at the hands 
of Case the week before, Bethany 
even practiced on Sunday to get 
ready for Tech.
Herb D'Alo's car broke down 
on the way to Bethany with half 
the Tech team aboard. When the 
Tartans finally arrived, they were 
somewhat taken aback by the un­
familiar Bethany course, which 
features a 200-yard vertical hill 
at the 2-1/2 mile mark.
Tech's Harry Burkholder walk­
ed the hill but still took first in 
21; 26, one second off the course 
record. After that, though, Be­
thany's depth told.
Chris Macosko couldn't catch 
Bethany's Rick Ward and finished 
third. Eric Levine and Roger
Cairns took sixth and seventh for 
Tech, and Kem Phillips managed 
eleventh. Bethany had second, 
fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth, and 
tenth, and the five low places ad­
ded up to 28 for a tie.

At Case, the school that beat Be­
thany, the shaken Tartans saw ano­
ther unorthodox course, one that 
combines confusing repeated loops 
in an open field with a tortuous 
path over creek beds and fallen 
trees. And the Case course is 
mostly level, a difficult change- 
of-pace for the Schenley Park 
hill-and-gully runners of Tech.
Case’s twin stars, Gary Stern 
and Jim Papp, took first and sec­
ond in 21;26 and 22;44, pulling 
away from Burkholder. But Burk­
holder, Cairns, and Macosko all 
finished at 22;48, and Levine took 
sixth at 23;13 despite falling in a 
ravine.
The final margin of victory was 
provided by hard-driving Kem 
Phillips, who nosed out Case's 
fifth man for ninth place.
This week's contests should be 
a little easier with Geneva at 4; 30 
this afternoon and St. Francis at 
11;30 a.m. Saturday, both at home. 
Waynesburg is the next big hurdle, 
away next Wednesday. They have 
a rough course and several promi­
sing new runners.
