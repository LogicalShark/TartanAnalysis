VOL. ITT, No. 32 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 1909 TEN CENTS
WHITE FRIARS AT SEWICKLEY
Last Saturday evening witnessed the first perfor­
mance of the White Friars show, “His Highness, the 
Chef” in the iSewickley Auditorium. All members 
of the cast and choruses together with many others 
of the company, left the Union Station Pittsburg 
early in the afternoon for Sewickley. Upon arriv­
ing, the entire party went at once to the theatre, and 
after having the dressing rooms assigned, were left 
free until 4 p. m. when a rehearsal was called. The 
majority of the croud went to the Y. M. C. A. and 
took a plunge and swim in their pool and watched a 
portion of a field meet that was in progress at the 
time. Dinner at the Park Place Hotel over, it was a 
case of hustle all the rest of the evening.
The curtain was rung up nearly half an hour late, 
entirely owing to delays in the make-up room. From 
the time of the start of the show until it closed, 
the audience was a live one and encores were de­
manded to every song and dance given; several 
numbers were omitted, as the time ¡before catching 
the last train was limited. Many of the scenes be­
tween different members of the cast were given a 
“hand,” but what brought the house to the point of 
realizing that something very much out of the ordin­
ary was going on, was the work of the dancing 
chorus. The girls, hot with their costumes and wigs, 
were worked almost to the limit to satisfy the spec­
tators. The glee chorus and the orchestra have re­
ceived much favorable comment on their good work, 
and the consensus of opinion in Sewickley was express­
ed iby saying that when the show had been given
several more times to get things running more 
smoothly in the ¡little details, it could be classed 
high among the college clubs of the East.
On Friday it will ibe repeated at the New Castle 
Opera House, and on May 25, at the Majestic Theatre, 
Butler, all before the Pittsburg performances at the 
Nixon, -May 29.

A Solace for Flunkers.
Remember always, students fair,
To keep your minds from boasting; 
And never down the hill Despair 
Too swiftly go a-coasting.
For whether one “H” they portion be 
Or whether a sad and mournful. “D”
A hundred years or so from now 
’Twill be all the same to thee. 
Whether in class thy diligence 
Has won the little “shark”,
Or whether thou art “heavy”
Without a bit of “spark.”
'Tis all the same to Orcus—
He’ll nab you in the end,
And in the boat of Charon 
H's and D’s all blend.

Miss B.—When I think it ought to be one I use the

Hear the recitation bells, iron bells;
What a world of solemn thought their sum­
moning compels!
In the silence of our room,
How we shiver at the gloom
And the melancholy menace of their tone!
How we shudder at the doom 
Which before us now doth loom;
With a desperate desire 
Leading higher, higher, higher,
And a resolute endeavor 
I^ow—now to shine, or never,
In that awful recitation coming soon.
—Ex.
The Senior Household Arts class last Wednesday 
afternoon visited the Roselia Foundling Asylum. 
They were piloted through the institution by the 
sweet faced Sisters who carefully explained every­
thing and saw to it that we missed nothing. They 
even did a small washing that we might see the 
laundry apparatus in operation. But it was in the 
nursery that we created the greatest stir. Each
of the hundred and twenty babies sang its song of 
welcome as we entered quite regardless of harmony, 
rhythm, or unity. A chorus of a hundred and twenty 
voices, each voice in a different key, is something 
calculated to create an impression even on a person 
of little musical intelligence, and we soon fled to 
more peaceful regions. The children of kindergar­
ten age recited for us and sang a couple of little 
songs evidently regarding us, unlike the younger 
ones, as rather interesting and harmless creatures.
On Thursday we visited Werner’s cleaning estab­
lishment at Bryant and St. Clair streets. It was 
very interesting and instructive to follow the pro­
cesses of dry and wet cleaning. We watched with 
wild alarm delicate laces being vigorously scrubbed 
with brush and soap, and felt quite sure that they 
and the plumes in a pan of suds, would be hope­
lessly ruined. But later on we saw the laces per­
fectly clean and whole and the plumes as beauti­
fully curled and fluffy as when new. We found it 
quite difficult to tear ourselves away from the room 
where plumes are finished and each girl came away 
with a firm determination to some day own a hat 
with a pale blue ostrich feather a yard and a half 
in length.
After leaving the establishment we spent a pleas­
ant hour at the home of Miss Woodside, where we 
were served with lemonade and cakes—-to counteract 
the taste of gasoline and naptha (specific gravities 
5S and 65 respectively).
Senior Class in Home Nursing.
Senior—“When treating a baby for croup, how long 
should one leave it in the warm bath?”
Dr. Martin—“Well, I wouldn’t leave it in indefinite­
ly.”
Later on, in the same lesson.
Dr. Martin—“Now, girls, if you ever want to find 
a person’s pulse and his or her wrist is too fat, you 
can get it in the neck.”
M. M. C. S. girls were pleasantly surprised to find 
two of their number occupying the most prominent 
positions in the historical pageant of the Playground 
Festival last Friday afternoon. They certainly 
looked good to us.
We were glad to see Miss Baldwin’s smile among 
us again and glad that she is so nearly recovered. 
Miss Harding is also improving. The Faculty seems 
as badly in need of a vacation as the students.
Answer to the Impertinent Inquirer.
The identity of the M. M. C. S. representative of 
Phoebus is a matter of absolutely no concern to any 
individual other than herself and her own chosen 
confidante. In other words, it is nobody’s busi­
ness!

The editors of the Tartan desire to call attention 
to the fact, that the columns of the paper are open at 
all times to the discussion of any topic or problem 
that may be of interest to the student body or fac­
ulty of Carnegie Tech. It is necessary that such ex­
pressions of opinion be made in Writing, and signed 
with the ‘writer’s name. The Tartan will publish a 
pseudonym upon request, but must know the author’s 
name. It is desirable that all such communications 
be made as brief as possible, and ibe made with some 
definite aim in view toward the betterment of Tech.
The base-ball team has been compelled to close 
its season and cancel the rest of its games, leaving 
the manager to collect the suits and other impedi­
ments as best he may. Incidentally the manager 
seems to be having his troubles locating a great 
deal of the stuff. It should not be ¡part of the duty 
of the manager to take care of the property as well 
as look after the schedule, etc., as he has plenty to 
do without 'that. Right now there seems to be no 
one to take care of the Athletic Association property, 
and, as a result, considerable of it is lost. Witness 
the base-iball suits that some of our ambitious re­
cruits have seen fit to take away with them, not to 
mention the foot-ball jerseys and shoes kept as souve­
nirs.
The tennis nets and other general property depend 
on the kindness of the Treasurer for their safe keep­
ing. The Board of Control should elect a general 
Property Man whose business it should be to take 
care Oi all Athletic property, and if one man could 
not do it all, let him appoint assistants.
The Thistles have arrived in sufficient numbers 
to fill the demand and by this time most everyone 
has looked over a copy. The book this year is a 
very considerable improvement over its predeces­
sors, as we hope each succeeding one will be; but 
like every other school enterprise the work was de­
layed considerably and the editors of the book han­
dicapped by tardy support.
It would certainly seem that we could get out a 
book or conduct some other enterprise in which 
one or two men would not ibe forced to do all the 
work. So far, however, we have not done so, al­
though the Athletic Association seems to have taken 
some semblance of life since the constitution was 
adopted, and shows a disposition to run ,hings that 
will undoubtedly work for the good of the school 
even if one or two mistakes have been made.
We are not exactly sure who is to have charge 
of the Thistle next year, but whoever it is to be 
should begin to cast about for an editorial board 
and material to fill the book, so that the victims of 
student popularity next year may have time to at­
tend a class or two.
About the tennis courts—the student Athletic 
Association owns two nets which are kept in Mr. 
Leeds’ office, sometimes. At the first Signs of 
spring weather the treasurer bought two sets so 
that students could use iboth courts when a chance 
offered without the necessity of borrowing the Fac­
ulty net. Sometimes both these nets can be found, 
sometimes they cannot. Occasionally one or two 
early birds happen to arrive early enough to play 
a set or so before school and then rather than 
put the net back where it belongs, put it away, in a 
locker so that they may have it again when they 
are at liberty. This is fine for the man who has 
the net, but what about the others whose rights to 
the net and court are every bit as good as the first 
ones?
NOTICE* TO THE GLEE CLUB MEN.
The management of the Glee Club has been con­
sidering for some time the advisability of giving a 
concert during commencement week and have finally 
closed a date for a concert on the Schenley Hotel lawn 
for June 15th. The tickets are already out, and as we 
are going to sing at least two new songs, it is necessary 
for every man to come out to rehearsals, as if we 
sing well it will be a big boost for the Club, and 
if we don’t—nuf ced. So every one come out and 
don't forget to bring with you all the Glee Club 
music you have so that the librarian has all the 
club music.

The Director is giving the Seniors a series of 
interesting and helpful talks on Monday mornings. 
He aims to follow them up with general discussions, 
hut the girls are rather slow at discussing. Perhaps 
they are ¡bashful.
The Prettiest Spot in Idlewild Park.
An artificial canal surrounds the island which is 
accessible only by a white iron bridge. As we walk 
leisurely across it we stop in the center to watch 
the little steam yacht as it passes under or an oc­
casional swan move noiselessly by. Except for the 
thug, thug, of the yacht all is quiet.
Leading from the ibridge is a gravel pathway bor­
dered on either side by a thick bushy hedge which 
curves around near the edge of the water and is 
finally lost among the large clusters of laurel.
Looking toward the center of the island we see 
many beautiful colors. Large round beds of cannas; 
oblong ones filled with geraniums surrounded by a 
¡border of coleus; and long narrow beds of helio­
trope, a quiet reposeful shade after viewing the 
violent reds. Hydrangeas, snow-balls and other 
hardy shrubs grow in artistic profusion through the 
island.
To the right of the bridge is a grove of -poplars 
wiiich make a cool and shady retreat out of the 
glaring sun.
Large willow trees grow all along the edge of the 
water and in a cluster of these trees is the boat 
¦house, where one may arrange for a ride in the 
launch or get a boat to row up the inlet for water 
lilies. M. N., ’11.

THE TARTAN9
DUAL TRACK MEET.
Our track team certainly showed its class on 
Saturday morning by defeating - our old rivals, the 
University of Pittsburg, 66 to 51, in a dual meet. 
A large crowd of Tech students were out and were 
very enthusiastic, cheering our men in every race. 
Pitt was clearly out-classed in the sprints, the only 
event of this kind which they won being the 440-yard 
dash. Ross, a last year Tech man who is attending 
Pitt, won this. Capt. Knotts, of Pitt, won the mile 
in the fast time of 4 minutes and 54 seconds.
Tech carried off seven firsts in the thirteen events. 
Dowling and Halferty were easily the stars for Tech, 
the former getting 16 points and the latter 16 points. 
Lefty Weger sprung a surprise by winning the broad 
with a jump of 19 feet and 3% inches. He only 
'beat. Boots, who is Tech's star broad jumper, by one- 
half inch. When Boots rounds into form he can eas­
ily do over 20 feet and should get first place in the 
intercollegiate meet next Saturday.
Because of Tech’s great showing Saturday morn­
ing in the meet with Pitt, every one is looking for 
them to take the intercollegiate meet which is to 
be heid here next Saturday.

The Big Four has presented Illinois with a drop 
testing machine for making impact tests on car 
couplers, wheels, etc. This apparatus consists of a

fifty feet high. Purdue is the only other university 
possessing a similar apparatus.

I PLEBE CLASS §
Prof. Hower spells church C—H—U—C—H. Sim­
plified spelling, doubtless.
Stone was seen in pattern shop eating his lunch 
with one hand and working with the other. Wouldn’t 
it have been awful if he had eaten his pattern?
Mr. Ralph, former Tartan representative, visited 
the schools on last Tuesday after a long illness.
Lamker (in Physics test)—What 
by a going star?
'oes he mean
Spielberg made a gallant dash for Prof. Keller's 
door the other day. Thirst for knowledge evidently 
lent wings to his feet.
McGough (in English)—Professor Doyle ran for 
President in 1820. We certainly have an elderly 
English instructor.
Section D held its class banquet on Thursday 
morning. The after-dinner speeches were fine. 
Prof. Doyle especially should have enjoyed them. 
He learned all about his future life up until the 
year 1932.
For free shaves, go to Blanchard. He shaved 
Skewis with some sand-paper the other day. It s 
hard to tell whether Skewis, Blanchard, or the sand­
paper was the worst hurt..
There’s no hope for us. Dr. James has sounded 
the death-knell for all burglars.
FOOT-BALL SCHEDULE.
Manager Bright, of the foot-ball team, has been 
working on the schedule for next fall and has com­
pleted it and all the contracts signed except two. 
In both these cases, howe^r, the terms offered have 
been accepted, so that there will probably be no 
hitch. *
The schedule is better balanced than the one last 
year and we should not be troubled about the large 
cripple list that distressed us last year, due to the 
concentration of heavy games. The schedule is as 
follows:
