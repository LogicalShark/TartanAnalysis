On Feb. 19, Kiva Han Cafe 
will close its doors for the last 
time. 
Standing at the southern 
corner of Forbes Avenue and 
Craig Street, the cafe has been 
a local landmark for Carnegie 
Mellon students and locals 
alike for 10 years.
Despite high popularity, a 
loyal clientele, and an excel-
lent location, John Mutchka, 
the owner of Kiva Han Cafe, 
has been forced to shut down 
his business. Mutchka said 
that several factors contrib-
uted to his decision, includ-
ing competition from the 
Starbucks directly across the 
street. 
“There are a lot of rea-
sons,” Mutchka said. “We’ve 
been here 10 years. And it’s 
really dif?cult for us to afford 
the rent. And somebody of-
fered more for the space, and 
was willing to build out the 
space.”
The Bagel Factory will be 
moving into Kiva Han’s cur-
rent location and will be ex-
panding upon the current 
property. 
The owners of the Bagel 
Factory — Charles Avalli and 
June and David Feldstein — 
said they plan to entirely reno-
vate the space, putting in new 
windows, all-new signage and 
paint, a larger kitchen, and 
increased seating. They hope 
to provide a more diner-like 
menu and atmosphere. With 
an emphasis on a more ex-
pansive menu, they believe 
the Starbucks across the street 
will not be too dangerous to 
their business.
“That corner will be com-
pletely redone,” Feldstein 
said. “We are putting in new 
windows and everything.” 
Feldstein noted that a new de-
cor will also be used, creating 
a new environment.
“We’ve taken some ?ack 
for [moving into the loca-
tion],” Feldstein said, “but 
we’re not a corporate giant. 
We’re a family business. I’m 
glad they kept it a Pittsburgh 
franchise.”
An applied anthropologist 
by trade, Mutchka conceived  
Kiva Han Cafe as an experi-
ment of sorts. 
While originally planned as 
an employee-owned and oper-
ated enterprise, when sales 
began to ?ag only two years 
after the opening, Mutchka 
felt that he could not, in good 
conscience, give the shop to 
his employees. 
Mutchka claims that some 
longtime patrons were on the 
verge of tears upon receiving 
the news of the shop’s closing.
“We all have the same 
mindset,” Mutchka said of 
the unique community that 
the coffee shop has attracted, 
“and that’s why Kiva Han was 
such a great place for us.”
“My world is literally fall-
ing apart because Kiva Han is 
closing,” said Rokhini Prabhu, 
a ?rst-year electrical and com-
puter engineering major. She 
said she preferred the “hip-
ster” vibe of the cafe over the 
neighboring Starbucks. 
“There’s something nice 
about being able to just sit 
there and enjoy good coffee in 
peace, which is not something 
I can do in Starbucks; [Kiva 
Han is] much quieter,” she 
added. “Although, in retro-
spect, that might explain the 
problem.”

Students receiving pack-
ages to their SMC addresses 
last week may have noticed 
that their pickup noti?ca-
tion came from an unfamiliar 
email address. Instead of the 
ladner@ address that stu-
dents have come to expect, 
sabrown@ appeared in the 
“from” line.
The response that met the 
change was overwhelming. A 
“We Miss You, Ladner” Face-
book group was set up, which 
gained over 250 likes in just a 
few days. 
Speculation regarding 
fraudulent emails and stories 
of epic mailroom mishaps 
almost immediately began 
circulating online. One of the 
stories, quoted on the “Over-
heard at Carnegie Mellon” 
Facebook group, questioned 
whether Ladner had ended 
up in “an epic ?st?ght with 
one of the mailroom robots 
who tried setting packages 
on ?re.”
Mark Ladner, the man 
behind the email address 
students have become 
acquainted with, said it was 
not such an interesting story. 
Instead, Ladner has simply 
moved locations from the 
University Center’s mailroom 
to the loading dock at the 
Mellon Institute.
“I’m looking forward to 
working at the Mellon Insti-
tute,” Ladner said. “I’m not 
going to miss the hard work 
[at the mailroom], but I will 
miss the students.... It’s rare 
that a person can have a job 
that makes a large number of 
people happy on a daily basis. 
I personally know what it’s 
like to order something and 
how happy it makes me when 
I know it’s delivered.” 
Those deliveries, which 
number over 140,000 per 
year, have left Ladner with 
innumerable stories from 
the four-and-a-half years he 
has worked as the University 
Center mailroom student co-
ordinator. “I have so many 
funny stories about package 
pickup ... from deliveries of 
live crickets to my ?rst expe-
rience with kimchi,” he said. 
Kimchi is a traditional fer-
mented Korean dish that Lad-
ner said gets delivered about 
every few weeks. Ladner said 
that he can identify the smell, 
even from among 500 other 
packages.
The strangest package 
Ladner ever received, how-
ever, was a 600-pound car 
transmission. “It arrived in 
a big wooden crate and was 
incredibly heavy. We sent 
the usual email to the stu-
dent, and when he arrived, 
he looked at me and asked, 
‘How do I get it back to my 
dorm?’... I would have loved 
to know what he did with it,” 
Ladner said. 
In addition to stories, if 
the online response is any 
indication, Ladner has accu-
mulated a group of students 
he has come to call friends. 
“Ladner is hands-down one 
of the most kindhearted and 
friendly people that I’ve had 
the chance to get to know 
here,” said ?fth-year senior 
psychology and social and 
decision sciences double ma-
jor Nicole Ickles. “His silly 
and bright attitude is conta-
gious. Even on the dreariest 
days, he never failed to make 
me smile.”
“I’ve made so many friends 
along the way,” Ladner said. 
“I get emails every so often 
from former students that 
just want to keep in touch.” 
However, even Ladner was 
surprised by the student re-
sponse to his departure from 
the mailroom.
“I feel really blessed to 
have had a job where I could 
affect so many people,” Lad-
ner said. “I tried to put myself 
in the students’ place and re-
alize that for each package, 
there was someone waiting 
for it.”

Student attempts to ban smoking
BRENT HEARD
Staffwriter
Postdoctoral physics stu-
dent Patrick Coles has started 
a petition to ban smoking on 
the Carnegie Mellon campus. 
As of last Thursday, the peti-
tion had received a total of 
534 signatures on ipetitions.
com. Coles said that he was 
“quite pleased by the support” 
his petition has received. “We 
are at the point where we 
should start talking to the ad-
ministration,” he said.
“The main issue is to pro-
tect people’s right to breathe 
clean air and to promote a 
healthy campus,” Coles said.
Coles recalled that he was 
inspired to start the petition 
after running on the campus 
track one evening, spending 
the time breathing in second-
hand smoke from one of the 
designated smoking areas. 
The petition’s description 
cites a survey conducted in 
the spring of 2009, in which 
89 percent of Carnegie Mel-
lon undergraduate students 
claimed not to smoke. Kelley 
Shell, health promotion spe-
cialist for Student Health Ser-
vices, said that the survey had 
480 respondents, almost all of 
whom were undergraduates.
Shell said that smokers 
face “a whole array of can-
cers” and are “more suscep-
tible to respiratory infections, 
bronchitis ... and, later in life, 
heart disease and stroke.” The 
Centers for Disease Control’s 
website corroborates Shell’s 
list of side effects.
According to Shell, the 
dangers of second-hand 
smoke vary depending on the 
individual and his or her levels 
of exposure, with children be-
ing the most susceptible. 
She added that “second-
hand smoke is classi?ed as a       
class-A carcinogen,” meaning 
that it contains cancer-causing 
agents. 
Second-hand smoke’s sta-
tus as a carcinogen has been 
the subject of some contro-
versy. The classi?cation was 
struck down in 1998 by a U.S. 
District Court in North Caro-
lina, which claimed that the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency had not followed re-
quired procedures when con-
ducting the study. However, 
this ruling was rejected by the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Fourth Circuit in 2002.
The last proposal for ban-
ning smoking on campus was 
introduced in 2006, with Staff 
Council voting in favor of the 
idea, but with Student Senate 
and the Graduate Student As-
sembly rejecting the proposal.
Since posting the petition, 
Coles said that he has been 
impressed by some of the 
comments it has received on-
line — comments that provide 
additional reasons to support 
a smoking ban, according to 
Coles.
First-year German and in-
ternational relations major 
Jamison Howell said that he 
is in support of the proposed 
smoking ban, especially since 
he is allergic to cigarette 
smoke. “It’s a shame I wasn’t 
at Carnegie Mellon in 2006,” 
Howell said in response to the 
previous attempt at a ban.
Howell complained that 
the current smoking policy 
is not being enforced and 
claimed that the current des-
ignated smoke areas are poor-
ly placed, speci?cally citing 
one in close proximity to the 
Children’s School playground 
and others in popular campus

Music in the Brain: 
Pitch, Plasticity, 
Imagery, and Emotion
Monday at 4:30 p.m. 
Steinberg Auditorium  
(Baker Hall A53)
Robert Zatorre, the James 
McGill Professor of Neuro-
science at McGill University, 
will be giving a talk on the 
brain’s response to music, ex-
plaining the mysteries of how 
the brain perceives music and 
why music sometimes elicits 
an emotional response. The 
lecture will focus on iden-
tifying the portions of the 
brain that deal with music 
processing and musical im-
agery. Zatorre will touch on 
studies that claim the strong 
positive emotion elicited by 
certain types of music seems 
to be mediated by the meso-
limbic dopaminergic system, 
a neural pathway believed to 
be associated with feelings of 
reward and motivation.
Entries from a Built 
Encyclopedia
Monday at 6 p.m. 
Carnegie Museum of Art 
Theater
Charles Rosenblum, an as-
sistant professor at Carnegie 
Mellon’s Schools of Art and 
Architecture, will give a lec-
ture on Henry Hornbostel’s 
School of Applied Design, 
now known as the College of 
Fine Arts. 
The building played an 
integral role in the promo-
tion of the arts on Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus. Unlike 
the buildings he designed 
for Carnegie Tech, and un-
like Hornbostel’s other ma-
jor works, the College of 
Fine Arts building was never 
published in a major archi-
tectural journal. Through an 
in-depth analysis of its design 
and construction, Rosenblum 
will af?rm the architectural 
signi?cance of the building.
Rosenblum has written 
numerous essays on Horn-
bostel’s works, and is cur-
rently working with ?lmmak-
ers on a documentary about 
Hornbostel’s architecture.
Hydrodynamics and 
Elastodynamics of 
Flagellated Bacteria
Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. 
Wean Hall 7218
Henry Shum, a professor 
at the University of Oxford, 
will present a new model of 
bacterial locomotion that 
considers elastic behavior in 
the hook that links the ?a-
gellar ?lament of bacteria to 
the motor in the cell body. 
The model, based on Gustav 
Kirchhoff’s rod theory, pre-
dicts upper and lower move-
ment on the hook’s stiffness 
for effective swimming, and 
hints at the possibility for 
more complex behaviors, like 
cell reorientation.
Google’s Speech 
Internationalization 
Project: From 1 to 300 
Languages and Beyond
Friday at 2:30 p.m. 
Giant Eagle Auditorium 
(Baker Hall A51)
Pedro J. Moreno, a re-
search scientist at Google, 
will present a lecture about 
Google’s speech recogni-
tion team. The team has 
developed speech recogni-
tion systems for more than 
30 languages in a little over 
two years. Moreno will dive 
into the acoustic modeling, 
lexicon, language modeling, 
infrastructure techniques, 
and social engineering tech-
niques used in the project. 
Google’s speech recognition 
team has the ultimate aim of 
building speech recognition 
systems for the world’s top 
300 languages.

Nadine Aubry, head of 
Carnegie Mellon’s mechani-
cal engineering department, 
has been recognized as a 
fellow of the American In-
stitute for Aeronautics and 
Astronautics (AIAA) for her 
work in aeronautical ?uid               
dynamics.
“I am deeply honored by 
this election,” Aubry said in 
a university press release.  
“At a time when aviation has 
become an inherent part of 
our life and our economy, it 
is crucial to continue mak-
ing technological advances 
[that] address reduced fuel 
consumption or sustainable 
fuel alternatives.”
Aubry will be one of 28 
AIAA members, selected 
from a membership of over 
36,000, who will be inducted 
in May as AIAA fellows at the 
AIAA Aerospace Spotlight 
Awards Gala in Washington 
D.C.
This most recent distinc-
tion is one of Aubry’s many 
scienti?c achievements. 
In addition to AIAA, Au-
bry is a fellow of the Ameri-
can Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, the 
American Physical Society, 
and the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers. 
She is also a member of 
the National Academy of 
Engineering, as well as vice- 
chair of the American Physi-
cal Society Division of Fluid 
Dynamics.
“Nadine is undoubtedly 
a leader in her ?eld and a 
wonderful role model,” said 
Pradeep K. Khosla, the dean 
of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, in the press re-
lease. “This latest honor is an 
indication of how widely rec-
ognized she is.”

Carnegie Mellon’s Center 
for the Arts in Society (CAS), 
a research center within the 
Dietrich College of Humani-
ties and Social Sciences and 
the College of Fine Arts, is 
launching a new initiative to 
explore how new media in-
?uences peoples social and 
political lives.
“The media initiative is 
an attempt to draw together 
Carnegie Mellon faculty who 
focus on media — whether 
they are ‘old’ or ‘new’ — and 
support projects that use the 
rubric of media as a vehicle 
to foster new, productive col-
laborations between artists 
and humanistic scholars,” 
said history professor Paul 
Eiss, the director of CAS, in a 
university press release.
The initiative will primar-
ily support three projects. 
The ?rst, Listening Spac-
es, seeks to understand the 
effects of technology on 
personal interactions with       
music. 
The second, entitled 
“Gender/Sexuality/Media,” 
will explore gender expres-
sions and representations in 
new media. 
The third project is cur-
rently open for proposals.
Another major aim of 
the initiative is to encour-
age students to participate 
in the growing and enriching 
dialogue on media-related is-
sues.
Professor of art James 
Duesing and professor of 
English Kathy Newman are 
heading up the project.
“Media allows for the hu-
manities and arts to come 
together around a shared 
theme,” Newman said in the 
press release. “Media and so-
cial change connects immedi-
ately in some way to the kind 
of work that many of us do at 
Carnegie Mellon.”

SUSIE FERRELL
Junior Staffwriter
“If you shut up and listen, 
maybe you’ll learn some-
thing,” The Onion’s head writ-
er Carol Kolb said, beginning 
her talk in McConomy Audito-
rium last Monday.
Sarcasm was to be expect-
ed from Kolb, the previous 
editor-in-chief of The Onion, 
a satirical newspaper. The On-
ion was established at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin-Madison 
in 1988 by Tim Keck and Chris 
Johnson. 
Since then, it has become 
a national publication with 
an online edition and a tele-
vision program. Kolb became 
involved with the paper after 
establishing herself through 
other comedy projects during 
her time at UW-Madison.
Inspiration for The Onion 
comes from serious sources.
“I just read the news,” 
Kolb said. “Either making fun 
of what’s in it or actually just 
making fun of the business 
of news and how ?ashy ev-
erything is and how dumbed 
down some stories are.”
The amount of real re-
search that goes into each 
article or video for The Onion 
varies with the writer’s famil-
iarity with the subject. If, for 
example, a writer knows little 
about how a bill is passed, 
some research will be done on 
the bill before he or she writes 
the article. 
The only news programs 
that are not targets of The On-
ion’s satirical comments are 
ones that are already satirical 
in nature. “You want to make 
sure you’re coming up with 
your own ideas,” Kolb said.
The satire of The Onion 
does have a history, how-
ever, of not being recognized 
as such. News sources from 
China’s Beijing Evening News 
to Fox News have reissued The 
Onion’s stories as true.
Despite the success of The 
Onion, the worry of falling ?at 
still crosses Kolb’s mind.
“Even more than we want 
things to have a point, we just 
want to make people laugh, 
so that always is a fear of just 
sort of making something too 
heavy-handed or not funny 
enough,” Kolb explained. 
“That’s always the hardest 
thing, having a point and mak-
ing it be satirical but also hav-
ing it be fun and silly.”
There is one worry that 
Kolb does not have, however. 
“There certainly are people 
out there who don’t ?nd it fun-
ny or ?nd us offensive, and we 
just kind of don’t care. Don’t 
read us, then.”
With the anything-goes 
style of The Onion, nothing is 
off limits. However, Kolb not-
ed that the publication does 
think about who it’s making 
fun of before they make a joke. 
“[The] 9/11 issue was a good 
example. We didn’t want to of-
fend anyone,” she said.
The one topic that people 
get sensitive about, Kolb said, 
is animals. In response to an 
article titled “Puppy Bowl 
Marred by Tragic Spinal In-
jury,” The Onion received an 
intensely negative response. 
“ ‘You went too far when you 
covered this,’ ” Kolb said, in 
the words of the critics. “Not 
when you made fun of can-
cer, or you made fun of the 
troops...”
In 2007, The Onion intro-
duced the Onion News Net-
work (ONN), a mock news 
program. “We de?nitely did 
have to re-learn what we 
were doing,” Kolb said. “We 
couldn’t just do what we did 
in the paper. We looked into 
modern 24-hour cable news.” 
One major difference is 
the lack of the “stodgy voice” 
the newspaper has. Instead of 
looking to precision in jour-
nalistic formality, the program 
is designed to be ?ashy and 
eye-catching.
“It kind of has to be,” Kolb 
said. “Especially when we 
were doing video, we found it 
just had to be a little more en-
gaging. It’s enjoyable to read 
something, but I think watch-
ing video, you need it to keep 
grabbing your attention — 
otherwise you’re going to turn 
it off.”
The ONN continues to grab 
viewers’ attention. The show 
has been renewed for a second 
season on IFC, thanks to “nine 
billion viewers across 811 
countries,” according to Kolb.
Many members of Carnegie 
Mellon’s satirical newspaper 
readme were in the audience.
Emily Forney, a senior lin-
guistics and Russian studies 
major and editor-in-chief of 
readme, said that she related 
to one of Kolb’s comments 
that  anything can spur satire, 
including a simple comment 
from the writer’s mother.  
Joe Selinger, a junior 
chemical engineering major 
and writer for readme, noted 
a difference between the arti-
cles he writes and those of The 
Onion. “Our articles do a lot of 
more college-related humor,” 
Selinger said.  
Kolb shared advice for 
aspiring satirists in the audi-
ence. “Try to think of some-
thing new. A new format or a 
new voice or something,” she 
said.
“When I started writing, 
as compared to a few years 
of writing, the difference was 
huge,” Kolb said. “You just 
have to write a lot and get peo-
ple to read it who will be criti-
cal of what you’re doing and 
actually say, ‘That’s not funny,’ 
or ‘That’s not good,’ and then 
just keep doing it.”
SMOKE, from A1
areas.
Coles said, “Even if this 
doesn’t go through, the 
administration should be 
aware of the non-ideal 
placement of existing smok-
ing areas.”
However, some people, 
such as ?rst-year informa-
tion systems major Michael 
Probber, are opposed to the 
notion of a campus-wide 
smoking ban. “I believe 
everybody has the right to 
their own decisions,” Prob-
er said. “Students didn’t 
sign up for a smoke-free 
campus.”
Instead, Probber sug-
gested that the petition 
be for the restructuring of 
designated smoking areas 
along with stricter enforce-
ment, as he felt a ban would 
“infringe on the rights of 
others.”
“In theory, [restructur-
ing designated smoking ar-
eas] would be effective at 
reducing people’s exposure 
[to second-hand smoke] on 
campus,” Shell said. But she 
said that this has been hard 
in practice. 
Shell claimed that a 
campus-wide smoking ban 
would be easier to police 
than 30 designated areas 
across campus, which she 
feels are not well marked.
Coles said that his smok-
ing ban proposal is differ-
ent from the 2006 attempt 
because of the changing 
culture at large. “What’s a 
bit different is that there’s 
a national movement, with 
648 colleges, as of Jan. 2, 
now enacting this policy,” 
Coles said. “I think people’s 
minds are changing.” 
A list of the 648 institu-
tions that have passed cam-
pus-wide smoking bans has 
been made available online 
by the American Nonsmok-
ers’ Right Foundation.
Since the last attempt 
at a campus-wide smoking 
ban, the administration has 
taken some steps to improve 
the campus’ environmental 
health. According to the 
Carnegie Mellon Environ-
mental Health and Safety 
website, these steps include 
a $25 ?ne for the improper 
disposal of cigarette butts. 
In the past, the “20-foot 
rule,” which disallows 
smoking within 20 feet of 
any Carnegie Mellon build-
ing, was also implemented.

Exposure to PFCs could reduce immune response
A recent study suggests 
that exposure to per?uori-
nated compounds (PFCs) can 
reduce immune response to 
vaccines. These compounds 
have been used for decades 
and are most commonly found 
in nonstick coatings and food 
packaging. Studies in animals 
have already suggested that 
PFCs suppress immune re-
sponse, but the effects of PFCs 
in humans have not been well 
understood. 
The study, led by research-
ers at Harvard University, 
examined how children with 
high levels of PFC exposure re-
sponded to vaccinations. The 
results showed that ?ve-year-
old children with higher PFC 
levels had weaker responses to 
diphtheria vaccines, suggest-
ing a possible link between 
PFC exposure to an underde-
veloped immune system. The 
EPA is already taking mea-
sures to eliminate certain PFCs 
in manufactured products.

Magnetically responsive soaps could aid in oil spill 
Chemists at the University 
of Bristol in the U.K. recently 
developed magnetically re-
sponsive soap that can poten-
tially be used to clean up oils 
without leaving behind harm-
ful residues. To make the soap, 
the researchers dissolved 
iron particles in water that 
contained chlorine and bro-
mine ions, common materials 
found in household cleaning 
products. The soap molecules 
contain metal centers, which 
allow them to be controlled by 
magnetic ?elds. 
Using magnets, research-
ers were able to pull the soap 
through layered solutions of 
water and oil and demon-
strate a simple way to recover 
the soap from the bulk solu-
tion. The physical properties 
of most soaps are controlled 
by temperature and pH, so 
the addition of magnetic func-
tionality introduces another 
design parameter for creating 
new soap compounds.

New de?nition of autism is more stringent
For the ?rst time in 17 
years, the American Psychiat-
ric Association is reassessing 
the de?nitions of autism and 
related disorders. Researchers 
from Yale University have per-
formed a preliminary analysis 
on the potential impacts of this 
new de?nition  of autism by as-
sessing data from a 1993 study 
on children and adults with 
autistic disorders. They deter-
mined the fraction of those in-
dividuals that would no longer 
be considered autistic under 
the proposed de?nition. 
Their results showed that 
55 percent of high-functioning 
individuals would no longer 
qualify as autistic under the 
new de?nition, whereas only 
25 percent of those previously 
diagnosed with “classic au-
tism” would no longer be diag-
nosed with autism. Narrowing 
the criteria for autistic disor-
ders would make it more dif-
?cult for individuals to qualify 
for health, educational, and 
social services.

North Star slowly fading away in the night sky
The North Star, also known 
as Polaris, may be shrinking 
according to a group of Ger-
man astrophysicists. Over 160 
years of observations suggest 
that the star, which sits over 
the North Pole because of its 
alignment with the Earth’s 
axis, may be shedding an 
amount of gas equivalent to 
Earth’s mass every year. The 
scientists measured the star’s 
pulse — the length of time be-
tween periods when the star 
grows dimmer and brighter. 
The data show that since 
1844, the star’s pulse has been 
decreasing, on average, about 
4.5 seconds every year. The 
changing rate is higher than 
what would normally be as-
sumed to match the standard 
model for stellar evolution, 
suggesting that the star may 
actually be shrinking.

Apple posts $13 billion in pro?ts from latest quarter
Apple Inc. recently re-
leased ?gures for its ?rst quar-
ter earnings, which shattered 
sales records in several cat-
egories. Apple executives are 
“very happy to have generated 
over $17.5 billion in cash ?ow 
from operations during the 
December quarter,” according 
to Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s 
chief ?nancial of?cer. 
The reported net pro?t of 
$13.06 billion this quarter is 
over twice the reported prof-
its from last year, and several 
products have experienced 
growth in sales. A record 37 
million iPhone units and 15.4 
million iPads were sold this 
year, which rounds out to 
128 and 111 percent, respec-
tively, in unit gains compared 
to the previous year. The suc-
cess of the iPhone as a smart 
phone and portable audio de-
vice comes at the expense of 
the iPod, which was the only 
product line to experience a 
decline in sales.

China to ?nally set cap on carbon emissions
The Chinese government 
has called for seven cities and 
provinces to set caps on their 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
This is the ?rst time the Chi-
nese government has ordered 
any absolute caps on emis-
sions, previously setting “car-
bon intensity” targets. This 
act is one of the ?rst concrete 
steps that the country has tak-
en  to address climate issues. 
Thus far, the Chinese gov-
ernment has delayed in set-
ting a national cap on green-
house gas emissions, citing the 
need for prioritizing economic 
growth. Rather than placing 
an absolute cap on emissions, 
targets have instead been set in 
terms of an amount of green-
house gas per unit of GDP. The 
current ?ve-year plan requires 
the country to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions by 17 per-
cent per unit of GDP.

CMU alumnus Scott Draves talks about Electric Sheep 
HOW THINGS WORKMicrophones: Converting sound into electric current
DANIEL TKACIK
SciTech Editor
In September of 1919, President 
Woodrow Wilson spoke to a crowd of 
nearly 50,000 at San Diego’s Balboa Sta-
dium in favor of his proposed League of 
Nations. In addition to the excitement 
surrounding a visit from the president, 
the Journal of San Diego History reported 
that those in attendance also witnessed a 
major triumph in technological history: It 
was the ?rst time the president had used 
an electric device to capture his voice, and 
after ampli?cation, make his voice heard 
to a large live audience. That device was a 
microphone.
The microphone was invented years 
before Wilson’s speech, by German-born 
American inventor Emile Berliner in 1876, 
according to the journal Technology and 
Culture. Wilson’s speech is just one illustra-
tion of how microphones were ?rst used. 
Today, microphones have countless appli-
cations: telephones, hearing aids, radio, 
television, and motion picture produc-
tions. Over the years, the microphone has 
changed in shape and form. However, it 
has retained the same identity at its core: A 
microphone is a transducer, which converts 
one form of energy into another. In the case 
of the microphone, sound is converted into 
electrical signal. 
Sound exists as a result of air vibrations 
and changes in air pressure, and there are 
several ways that microphones capture 
those changes and turn them into electric 
currents. Two of the most common forms 
are “dynamic” and “condenser” micro-
phones.
A dynamic microphone operates through 
a concept called electromagnetic induction. 
Put simply, sound waves travel past a small 
metal plate called a diaphragm, which is 
attached to a coil of wire surrounded by a 
magnet. When the coil vibrates within the 
magnetic ?eld in response to sound, electric 
current is produced, thus converting sound 
energy into electric energy.
Condenser microphones operate on dif-
ferent principles. In these microphones, 
sound waves cause two electrically-charged 
metal plates to vibrate. These two metal 
plates are collectively known as a capacitor. 
The microphone’s diaphragm acts as one of 
the plates of the capacitor, and when the 
distance between the two plates changes as 
they vibrate in response to sound, electric 
current is produced.
One key difference between condenser 
and dynamic microphones is that the use of 
a capacitor in a condenser microphone re-
quires a source of power, whether it is a bat-
tery inside the microphone or some exter-
nal power source. A dynamic microphone, 
on the other hand, can operate without any 
source of electricity.
There are several other types of micro-
phones, such as the ribbon microphone — 
which produces electrical current when a 
metal ribbon vibrates in response to sound 
within a magnetic ?eld — and the electret 
microphone — which is a type of condenser 
microphone that is commonly used in de-
vices such as cell phones and computers. 
One of the ?rst microphones, the carbon 
button microphone, consists of two metal 
plates that are separated by compacted car-
bon granules. When sound enters the mi-
crophone, the vibrations induce a change 
in pressure between the granules. An elec-
tric current traveling through the gran-
ules changes in response to the change in 
pressure.
Microphones have come a long way 
since their creation in the late 19th cen-
tury. Today, microphones can capture 
sound from speci?c directions relative to 
the direction the microphone is pointed. 
For example, omnidirectional microphones 
capture sound in all directions, while “shot-
gun” microphones focus on one certain 
direction and are relatively insensitive to 
other directions.
Despite these additional features and 
improvements in microphone sensitiv-
ity, the inner workings have remained the 
same and enable society to communicate 
through sound, and preserve those sounds 
over time.

Draves’ project, Electric Sheep, creates and strings abstract images together into a video that can be used as 
a computer screensaver. 
BENJAMIN MADUEME
Staffwriter
Can computers be artists? 
Scott Draves, a Ph.D. gradu-
ate from Carnegie Mellon’s 
School of Computer Science 
and developer of the Electric 
Sheep project, has answered 
that question with a de?nitive 
“yes.”
Draves, who now works 
as an engineer in the map-
ping division at Google Inc., 
gave a talk last Monday at the 
Gates Hillman Complex about 
the project. He recalled how 
Electric Sheep began with his 
image-generating Flame Al-
gorithm, which he ?nalized 
in 1991 and later released as 
open source in 1993. 
The algorithm works 
by solving a massive, non-
deterministic equation with 
thousands of parameters and 
millions of variables. Because 
the algorithm is non-deter-
ministic, it generates a unique 
image every time it is run. The 
highly ?uid and organic im-
ages that result are commonly 
known as Flames.
“It takes a long time for 
the computer to draw these 
pictures,” Draves explained. 
“It takes hours to render just 
one frame. Back then, in the 
early nineties, that’s all I was 
able to do ... but now, with 
much faster computers and 
with thousands of computers 
working together, we can ac-
tually make large-scale, ani-
mated artworks.”
The animated works 
Draves referred to come from 
his Electric Sheep project, a 
free program that perpetually 
generates Flames using his 
algorithm. When a computer 
enabled with Electric Sheep 
goes into screensaver mode, 
the Flames are strewn togeth-
er into a highly abstract video. 
Since each Flame is a new 
and unique image, the com-
puter then shares the image 
with other computers over the 
internet.
Over time, Draves added 
additional components to the 
project, including the ability 
for users to “like” or “dislike” 
certain Electric Sheep screen-
savers using the keyboard, 
telling the algorithm what 
sort of images to create.
Many computer users are 
fond of the project. Accord-
ing to a recent post on Draves’ 
blog, there are approximately 
500,000 active users of the 
software, some of whom are 
Carnegie Mellon students.
“I’ve played around with 
the Electric Sheep screensav-
er before,” said Joe Frazier, a 
junior computer science ma-
jor who attended the talk. “I 
thought it was really neat to 
see the guy who sort of came 
up with it all. It was good to 
see what his perspective on it 
was.”
Draves is receiving ongo-
ing recognition for his Flame 
Algorithm and Electric Sheep 
project. His work has been 
featured in the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York City 
and at the Art Basel art show 
in Miami. 
His work has also appeared 
in Discover and Wired maga-
zines. Flames have also been 
used in all sorts of media, 
ranging from big-budget ?lms 
to book covers. The popular 
Flame editor Apophysis uti-
lizes Draves’ algorithm.
“Generation 243,” one of 
Draves’ original Electric Sheep 
screensavers, is currently 
featured on a 24/7 display 
on campus in the Gates Hill-
man Complex. The School 
of Computer Science also re-
cently purchased “Generation 
244,” the next work in the 
series.
Draves, who is involved 
in numerous other artistic 
projects, also touched on a 
website he created called 
“Video Riot.” The site uses Ja-
vascript and WebGL to distort 
and colorize a Youtube video 
that a user can specify with a 
link. The project is located at 
sp0t.org/videoriot.

Researchers study cost effectiveness of storm protection
MICHAEL SETZER
Staffwriter
Last year was plagued with 
monetary losses from tropical 
cyclones — Hurricane Irene 
was estimated to cost over $7 
billion in damages alone, ac-
cording to ABC News. With 
some scientists predicting an 
increase in intense weather 
due to the sea’s rising surface 
temperatures, it is becom-
ing increasingly important to 
protect coastal populations. 
Researchers at Carnegie Mel-
lon and Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology have col-
laborated to study the cost 
effectiveness of different ap-
proaches to storm manage-
ment and to look at possibili-
ties for the future.
Postdoctoral researchers 
Kelly Klima and Iris Gross-
mann and professor M. 
Granger Morgan — all from 
Carnegie Mellon’s department 
of engineering and public 
policy — conducted research 
that compared different pre-
ventative approaches with 
hypothetical tropical cyclones 
in ?ve regions in Florida’s 
Miami-Dade County. Their 
research was published in a 
recent issue of Environmental 
Science and Technology.
The researchers ran model 
simulations to compare two 
categories of preventative 
methods. “Hardening” focus-
es on the physical alteration 
or the building of structures, 
such as raising homes on 
stilts or building a barrier that 
would help block the excessive 
?ooding associated with storm 
surge. “Hurricane modi?ca-
tions” use wind-wave pumps 
to lower sea surface tempera-
ture and lessen a hurricane’s 
intensity. Both of these meth-
ods were tested against storm 
surge damages and wind dam-
ages separately.
When running the simula-
tions with the different sce-
narios, the researchers tested 
the preventative methods on 
conditions under what they 
referred to as “return periods,” 
which range from 10 to 1,000 
years. For example, choosing 
a 1,000-year return period for 
their model simulation meant 
that on average, severe storm 
conditions would only occur 
once in 1,000 years. A 10-
year return period, therefore, 
would assume intense storms  
occur once every 10 years, on 
average.
The initial tests showed 
that the wind and storm 
surges’ intensity would gener-
ally reduce with a lower sea 
surface temperature. It is im-
portant to note, however, that 
each region tested had slightly 
different results.
When the researchers com-
pared the costs of the different 
preventions and adaptations 
for surge damage, they found 
that building a storm barrier 
would be the most cost-ef-
fective solution for hurricane 
damage prevention.
“Many in the community 
think that dams are very ex-
pensive and are not always a 
good return, so [the fact that 
it was the most cost effec-
tive] was surprising,” Klima 
said. The researchers also 
found that certain methods 
were more helpful for differ-
ent regions. Although a surge 
barrier was effective for most 
regions, other options such 
as “hardening” were actu-
ally more helpful for some re-
gions with a 1,000-year return 
period.
For wind, the results were 
similar across the board for 
the ?ve regions. A combina-
tion of all the preventions 
would be the best to help pro-
tect outlying areas from cy-
clone damage. 
However, there is still much 
that the research leaves unan-
swered. For one, all the data 
on lowering sea temperatures 
assumes that, as Klima said, 
“the wind-wave pumps work 
[how] the scientists say they 
should.”
For many, that is a big as-
sumption. The idea of hurri-
cane modi?cation is not new, 
but past attempts may have 
discouraged future research. 
An article in EARTH magazine 
mentions scientists’ aversion 
to hurricane geoengineering, 
citing a failed government 
experiment in weather modi-
?cation named Project Storm-
fury. Until recently, there has 
been little attempt at hur-
ricane modi?cation since 
Stormfury. 
The public has a nega-
tive perception on hurricane 
modi?cation. After interview-
ing Florida residents, Klima 
noted, “Something that po-
tentially modi?es the storm is 
not going to be acceptable for 
a very long time.” 
In her previous paper “Pub-
lic Perceptions of Hurricane 
Modifcation,” she explained 
that the practice was pub-
licly perceived as “relatively 
ineffective.”
Moreover, there is still a 
missing link in terms of how 
much damage storm surge 
and wind cause jointly. Al-
though the researchers were 
able to run the data and com-
pare cost-effective strategies 
against wind and surge sepa-
rately, they currently do not 
have data on the exact rela-
tionship between the dam-
ages of wind and storm surge 
together.
With extensive cost analy-
sis, Klima has given all of her 
research to the Miami-Dade 
County government. It is now 
up to the policymakers to de-
termine what is best for the 
future of hurricane adaptation 
and modi?cation.
Klima has faith. “Policy-
makers are pretty smart peo-
ple,” she said. “They try to do 
the right things.”

Google raises privacy concerns with its new policy
Mayor’s racist remarks highlight strong disconnect
State of the Union deserves more student attention
KYLE HENSON
As the Republican primaries in-
tensify, Republican presidential can-
didate Mitt Romney has been under 
?re from liberals and conservatives 
alike for his 15 percent effective tax 
rate and his time at the ?nancial ser-
vices company Bain Capital. 
Instead of skirting around these 
issues, Romney needs to start using 
both his time at Bain Capital and his 
tax rate to highlight the character-
istics that set him apart from fellow 
Republican candidate Newt Gin-
grich and President Barack Obama.
Romney is often criticized for his 
past tendency at Bain Capital to in-
vest in ?rms and restructure them, 
often at the cost of jobs. 
What people fail to realize is 
that the companies the ?nancial 
services ?rm invested in needed to 
be restructured: They were operat-
ing at losses or had limited growth 
prospects.
As a result, Bain Capital took 
over management and reorganized 
companies like Dunkin’ Donuts and 
Burger King to become pro?table 
again. Because these companies 
were already hurting, many of them 
would have gone out of business, 
resulting in all of those companies’ 
jobs being lost. 
Bain Capital’s intervention had 
served to save some jobs that would 
have been otherwise lost without 
radical shifts in the company’s way 
of doing things.
In other instances, Bain Capital’s 
actions gave struggling companies 
a business plan to become an inter-
national chain, such as with Staples 
and Domino’s Pizza. Bain Capital 
created 110,000 jobs, and saved 
many more, during Romney’s time 
with the company. His time at Bain 
Capital serves to show that he not 
only knows how to streamline the 
government to make it more ef-
?cient, but that he also has experi-
ence creating and saving jobs in the 
private sector.
Romney’s critics also view his 
tax rate of 15 percent as a detriment 
to his candidacy. Though Romney 
earned $27 million last year, most 
of his money came from investment 
income, which is taxed at a rate of 
15 percent instead of the top income 
tax rate of 35 percent. 
Obama and Warren Buffet, CEO 
of Berkshire Hathaway, have both 
criticized this tax rate, citing that 
it allows the top one percent to be 
taxed far less than most upper-mid-
dle class families.
The reason this tax is lower, how-
ever, is because it is a double tax. All 
investment income is already taxed 
at the corporate rate of 35 percent, 
and then again at a rate of 15 per-
cent. This is a tax of 45.25 percent, 
a higher rate than nearly any other 
tax.
Moreover, the initial rate is lower 
because investment income is much 
riskier. There is a 100 percent guar-
antee of wage income, provided that 
you work. There is a very real pos-
sibility that investors will lose large 
sums of money when they make 
risky investments. 
This lower rate is put in place to 
encourage investment and keep the 
economy growing.
If Romney embraces these two 
aspects of his life instead of shying 
away from them, he can provide 
a compelling case for pro-growth 
tax reform and limited government 
regulation. Under this system, more 
Americans can achieve the bene?ts 
of both personal investment and in-
vestment by capital funds. 
Emphasizing this would make 
Romney more attractive to Repub-
licans, who want a nominee that 
can argue the merits of hard work 
and free markets, and to the general 
electorate, who want the economy 
to get moving again.

“Don’t be evil.”
It was an optimistic creed, while 
it lasted. Google: the young, upstart, 
idealistic challenger to the monopo-
listic behemoth that was Microsoft. 
With its simple interface and honest 
business practices, Google could do 
no wrong. Its of?ces were the envy of 
the tech world and its young found-
ers were testaments to the fact that 
success was possible after the dot-
com bubble collapsed. 
Those happy days are now over.
On March 1, Google will aggre-
gate all the information it has on 
each user into single user pro?les. 
Until now, this information was of-
ten split up among many different 
services. Google Latitude location 
data was separate from YouTube fa-
vorite videos data, which in turn was 
separate from Gmail messages and 
contacts. Beginning in March, all this 
data will be linked much more intri-
cately than it is now.
Google claims that these changes 
to its privacy policy and terms of ser-
vice are made with only users’ inter-
ests at heart. Search results will be 
more accurate and advertisements 
more relevant. For most users, what 
Google says will be true. Their expe-
riences will be better, and they will 
see no ill effects.
Yet concentrating the enormous 
amount of data that Google has on 
people presents a profound privacy 
problem. We do not claim that the 
company will suddenly violate its 
policy and sell this data to the high-
est bidder. Google’s past privacy de-
bacles have been due to shortsight-
edness, not malice. Google Buzz 
publicized Gmail users’ contact lists 
without warning — with the new 
policy changes, that mistake would 
likely have revealed users’ location 
histories, photos, and videos. 
Over the last few years, Google 
has demonstrated that it can’t be de-
pended on to protect users’ privacy. 
Regardless of the good intentions of 
Google’s engineers, history shows 
that their efforts often leave user 
information susceptible to security 
breaches. Upcoming privacy changes 
are dangerous to information integ-
rity and should leave users wary of 
how secure their information is with 
Google.
When East Haven, Conn. Mayor 
Joe Maturo blurted out, “I might 
have tacos when I go home. I’m not 
sure yet,” during an interview last 
Wednesday, he most likely didn’t 
envision the backlash that would 
ensue.
The off-color comment was said 
in response to a reporter asking, 
“What are you doing for the Latino 
community today?” In the days that 
followed, the overwhelmingly nega-
tive response to Maturo’s comment 
has grown to epic proportions. CBS, 
FOX, NBC, Time, and The New York 
Times have all covered the “taco inci-
dent” in one form or another.
At ?rst glance, this news cover-
age is a bit excessive for an attempt 
— albeit a bad attempt — at a joke. 
However, a second glance and a look 
into the recent history of East Haven 
reveals something far worse.
Until recently, East Haven was a 
predominantly white community. 
According to MSNBC, 10 percent 
of the city’s population is now La-
tino, but only one of 50 of?cers on 
its police force speaks Spanish. Po-
lice harassment toward Latinos has 
been investigated since 2009, ?nally 
reaching a breaking point this past 
Tuesday when the FBI arrested four 
East Haven policemen for excessive 
force, false arrest, and conspiracy 
against primarily Latino citizens.
It was in this tense atmosphere 
that Maturo said, “I might have 
tacos.”
This statement reveals a disturb-
ing disconnect. How can a man 
whose job consists of being aware  
of and ?xing the problems in his 
community be so ?ippant? It’s hard 
to govern when one is oblivious. We 
think that there really isn’t much of 
an excuse for Mayor Maturo.
The public seems to agree. Short-
ly after Maturo’s comment, activists 
coordinated to deliver 2,000 tacos to 
his of?ce. 
What he needs to do now is either 
acknowledge his ineptness and re-
sign, or put every effort into address-
ing the concerns of the Latino com-
munity. Whether Maturo resigns or 
stays, whoever is mayor in East Ha-
ven must acquaint his or herself with 
the issues of the community before 
positive changes can be made.
Did you watch President Obama’s 
State of the Union address last week? 
We didn’t. It turns out that he talked 
about ?nancial aid and foreign stu-
dents. He even talked about tech 
jobs and became the ?rst president 
to mention “start-ups” in a State of 
the Union.
Here’s a quick rundown: Among 
emphasis on high-tech manufac-
turing, a stable economy with fair 
taxes, energy self-suf?ciency, and 
increased national security, Obama 
?rst encouraged America to become 
“a country that leads the world in 
educating its people.”
Part of that is improving K-12 edu-
cation, Obama said. He outlined pay-
ing teachers more and paying them 
for performance, but at the same 
time lessening the onerous burden of 
standardization, which encourages 
schools to teach to the test. 
Obama also laid out several sug-
gestions just for college students. 
“Congress needs to stop the interest 
rates on student loans from doubling 
in July.” Did you even know that was 
going to happen? The problem is 
that we didn’t help the situation at 
all. As college students who under-
stand these dif?culties ?rsthand, we 
should be taking an active political 
role in shaping the future for stu-
dents just like us.
State schools should have more 
money, but they should also learn to 
teach in a more cost-effective man-
ner. “So let me put colleges and uni-
versities on notice,” Obama warned. 
“If you can’t stop tuition from going 
up, the funding you get from taxpay-
ers will go down.” This is a perfect 
example of an issue that requires the 
input, or at least the attention, of col-
lege students.
Obama also addressed the fact 
that we welcome foreign students 
and then make them go home once 
they graduate. “That doesn’t make 
sense,” he said.
Finally, Obama urged Congress to 
help start-ups and small businesses 
succeed and to support technologi-
cal development so that America will 
have new jobs and industries, “the 
same kind of research and innova-
tion that led to the computer chip 
and the internet.”
So none of us watched the State 
of the Union (although we did see 
a cool four-minute video called “Be-
hind the Scenes: Writing the 2012 
State of the Union Address”). How-
ever, the political landscape needs 
the attention of college students. 
What a change from our usual po-
litical fare: Wikipedia hunger strikes 
to protest SOPA and Photoshopped 
politicians on Reddit. 
More needs to be done; it’s our 
responsibility to be more aware of 
what’s going on, to reach out to 
our representatives, and to make a 
difference.

A PERSON’S OPINION
January 30, 2012 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
Compiled by Jonathan Carreon
It’s the Giants vs. the Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday, so we asked,
What are you doing for the Super Bowl?
ANNA WALSH
In the Pennsylvania General As-
sembly, the House Bill 1077 — also 
referred to as the Women’s Right 
to Know Act — has been making 
headway since its introduction last 
October and has 112 co-sponsors. 
Although the bill claims to be for 
women’s rights, the actual details of 
the bill imply the opposite.
Bill 1077 would require a woman 
to view and sign for copies of her 
fetal ultrasound photos before she 
could get an abortion. 
If the woman had the ultrasound 
more than two weeks before her 
abortion, the doctor would be re-
quired to offer her an ultrasound 
video of the fetus and inform her of 
the fetus’ heartbeat and age prior to 
the abortion.
Proponents of the bill claim that 
it would enhance women’s rights by 
making sure they were giving “truly 
informed consent” before having an 
abortion. Maria Vitale Gallagher, 
the legislative director of the Penn-
sylvania Pro-Life Federation, told 
lifenews.com, “This legislation rep-
resents a victory for patients’ rights. 
Women have a right to all relevant 
information about their pregnan-
cies. With this additional knowledge, 
women can be empowered to make 
informed choices for themselves and 
their families.”
This bill isn’t empowering wom-
en; it’s trying to bully them into not 
getting an abortion. Gallagher claims 
that “women have been pressured 
into making a decision on abortion 
without having all the facts,” but 
statistics on the women who receive 
abortions reveal just the opposite. 
A 2005 study published in the 
journal Perspectives on Reproductive 
and Sexual Health showed that only 
14 percent of women who got an 
abortion said they had the procedure 
because their partner wanted them 
to, and even those women often had 
additional reasons as to why they 
wanted the abortion.
Furthermore, 60 percent of wom-
en who receive abortions are already 
mothers, meaning that they have al-
ready gone through pregnancy and 
are well aware of the facts of child-
bearing. To claim that these women 
do not have all the facts is horri?cally 
condescending.
Pennsylvania has already tried to 
make it extremely dif?cult for wom-
en to receive an abortion. If a woman 
wants an abortion, she must already 
receive state-directed counseling 
that includes information designed 
to discourage her from having one, 
and then wait 24 hours before the 
procedure is provided. 
House Bill 574, which passed last 
year, placed additional requirements 
on abortion facilities with the claim 
that it would make abortions safer 
for women. However, its require-
ments — including dedicated park-
ing spaces, medical-grade elevators, 
and extended hallways — seem less 
about women’s safety and more 
about placing ?nancial burdens on 
abortion facilities.
If the state’s goal has been to 
make it more dif?cult to maintain an 
abortion facility, it has been work-
ing: The number of abortion provid-
ers declined by 11 percent between 
2005 and 2008, and 82 percent of 
Pennsylvania counties do not have 
abortion providers. House Bill 1077 
(whose numerous co-sponsors, it’s 
worth noting, are overwhelmingly 
male) merely hopes to further inter-
fere with a woman’s ability to receive 
an abortion. It places an additional 
hurdle for women to cross — and an 
additional ?nancial burden, since the 
required ultrasound must be billed 
separately from the actual abortion.
This bill is expected to come up 
for vote soon in the Pennsylvania 
General Assembly. Contact Penn. 
House Representative Dan Frankel 
and Penn. Senator Jay Costa, both 
of whom represent our area of Pitts-
burgh, and let them know that House 
Bill 1077 isn’t advancing women’s 
rights — it’s infringing upon them.

Shortly before 9 p.m. on Saturday, 
Jan. 21, Onward State — Pennsylva-
nia State University’s online student 
publication — reported former foot-
ball coach Joe Paterno’s lung can-
cer-induced death. The report ?ew 
through Facebook and Twitter, and 
soon CNN and other news sources be-
gan to report (and tweet) the news. 
Journalists such as Anderson Cooper, 
Howard Kurtz, and Huf?ngton Post 
columnists began to tweet Paterno’s 
death. Many Americans scurried to 
offer their condolences; loved ones 
that knew him and fans that admired 
him united to wish him well.
However, Paterno died on Sunday 
morning. Although family members 
demanded that reports of his death 
be deleted the night prior, the use of 
social media ensured that the state-
ments had been set in stone. Many 
news sources were quick to issue both 
their apologies for misinformation 
and condolences to family members, 
but the initial ?ow of online postings 
was enough to sustain the news.
Social media has everyone in a 
frenzy, and rightfully so. The rapid-
ity of Twitter and other platforms 
has truly changed the way we com-
municate, shifting news to a more 
grassroots process, rather than a “Big 
Media” product. Tweets, paragraph-
long blog posts, or minute-to-minute 
podcasts are slowly replacing tradi-
tional news articles as ultimate dis-
seminators. When this craze blurs 
into a haze, however, is when the 
true problem arises.
When Representative Gabrielle 
Giffords (D–Ariz.) was shot earlier 
last year, NPR and other news sourc-
es were quick to report her death. 
Social media grasped onto the state-
ments, and created a frenzy of “RIP 
Gabby Giffords” posts, solidifying her 
death within the news world. Gif-
fords, however, had not died, and is 
fortunately still alive today.
Traditional news sources are al-
ways dominant because they are 
trusted. Editing processes are com-
plex and constant, thus reassuring 
the reader that he or she has factual 
information. Blogs and social media 
platforms do not usually have an 
elaborate editing process. A lack of 
this process inhibits social media’s 
credibility as a news source.
Many criticize social media plat-
forms for a lack of journalistic in-
tegrity. Bloggers and Twitter users 
usually respond with the idea of 
“crowdsourcing,” the mechanism in 
which social media users will quickly 
respond to misinformed tweets and 
posts, thus ensuring objectivity and 
factuality. 
Although I understand this con-
cept in theory, I feel that it fails in 
practice. The rapidity of social media 
often prevents any source checking.
Social media mistakes should not 
continue to happen. Although the 
quick nature of these media is admi-
rable, accuracy must be maintained. 
Because of social media, false infor-
mation can spread and create public 
opinions based on inaccuracy.
Efforts are constantly made to 
create a balance between new media 
and traditional journalism. Measures 
to build and maintain public trust 
in each ?eld are crucial to media’s 
continued successes. Journalists and 
bloggers often deal with delicate 
news topics, and the ?rst step to im-
proving media is to ensure accurate 
information.
Media sources, whether grass-
roots or mainstream, must check 
their facts and ensure integrity be-
fore publishing. Readers must also 
understand that, in the context of 
more delicate issues, social media 
cannot be their sole source of news. 
Twitter users and bloggers should 
double-check their sources, just as 
traditional journalists do, in order 
to create a more reliable system. Ac-
curacy should never be sacri?ced for 
immediacy in reporting. 
Until this happens, the social me-
dia revolution will never truly occur 
and the balance will always be tradi-
tionally bent.

WILL WIENER
Student Senate is facing an 
exciting semester that presents 
a great opportunity to establish 
more presence on campus. In the 
past we have often been criticized 
for our lack of publicity, and rightly 
so. We are now attempting to take 
large steps to change this, one be-
ing the launch of cmusenate.org. 
This site contains short updates 
from our meetings, information 
about our initiatives, and news on 
university policy changes to help 
you know what we are up to. In ad-
dition, we will be tabling more fre-
quently throughout the semester 
— look for us this Friday where we 
will be handing out hot chocolate 
and collecting feedback.
We are busy working on several 
projects, including investigating 
how effectively the University Cen-
ter’s space is being used — speci?-
cally in the game room, where we 
are looking to make signi?cant 
upgrades and additions. We will 
also be piloting a table-sharing 
program in crowded dining areas, 
expanding the number of courses 
with reserve textbooks, and work-
ing to ensure that all students are 
able to choose their Interpretation 
and Argument course topic. 
Of course there are many more 
projects in progress, which you can 
?nd out about at our meetings or 
by visiting cmusenate.org.
Finally, Senate will be work-
ing with all branches of student 
government to ?ght the proposed 
route cuts by the Port Authority. 
I serve on the Pittsburgh Student 
Government Council (PSGC), 
which is made of representatives 
from all student governments in 
Pittsburgh. It has a tremendous 
amount of political power, as we 
successfully fought against the 
tuition tax of 2009–10 and other 
proposed cuts last year. I will work 
to combine the voices of our cam-
pus and the PSGC to make sure 
we don’t lose the bus services that 
are vital to student life at Carn-
egie Mellon. To do this, I will need 
your help. Resources will soon be 
available on our site to allow you 
to contact your representative and 
demand that the current and nec-
essary bus routes remain.
Our projects and our advocacy 
cannot be successful if we don’t 
hear from you. I encourage you to 
email student-senate@ with initia-
tives and feedback.

The Carnegie Mellon 
swimming and diving team 
hosted its ?nal home meet 
this past Saturday against 
Denison University, last year’s 
national champions.
The women lost with an 
overall score of 164–120, and 
the men also fell to the Big 
Red 178-114.
Performing consistently 
well throughout the season, 
sophomore Soleil Phan won 
the 100-yard freestyle race in 
54.19. Phan later came in sec-
ond in the 200-yard freestyle 
with a time of 1:55.44, im-
proving her time in the event 
by over three seconds since 
the ?rst meet of the season at 
the University of Rochester.
First-year Kelley Sheehan 
also made an impression in 
the pool during the course of 
her ?rst season with Tartan 
athletics. As a member of the 
victorious 400-yard medley 
and 200-yard medley relay 
at Rochester back in October, 
Sheehan continued to come 
through strong at the meet 
last Saturday, placing fourth 
in the 100-yard backstroke. 
She also placed fourth in the 
500-yard freestyle of 5:16.25, 
?nishing with a season-best 
time.
In her last home meet, se-
nior Olivia DeFazio placed 
second in the one-meter div-
ing board with 228.75 points, 
a season best for her. She has 
been a part of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s swimming and diving 
team for four years.
“As a team, the swimmers 
and divers show great support 
for each member,” DeFazio 
said. “It’s impressive how 
the unof?cial leaders on the 
team set such high standards 
for the newer members. It’s 
been an exciting four years as 
a member of the team, and I 
know my college experience 
has been far better because of 
my involvement.”
On the men’s team, sopho-
more Eddie Sears has been 
swimming consistently well 
throughout the season — in-
cluding the 400-yard medley 
relay, 200-yard medley, and 
50-yard freestyle. 
At Saturday’s meet, Sears 
?nished the 50-yard freestyle 
in third place with a time of 
22.03.
Sophomore Austin Bohn 
also swam well this season, 
earning two NCAA “B” cuts at 
the Nike Cup at the end of the 
fall. Against Denison, Bohn 
placed fourth in the 100-yard 
breaststroke with 1:01.28.
Competing in his ?nal 
home meet, senior Eli Fatsi 
?nished ?fth on the one-me-
ter board with 274.34 points 
and sixth on the three-meter 
board with 273.08 points. In 
his ?nal season with Carnegie 
Mellon swimming and diving, 
Fatsi nearly broke both of the 
school diving pool records, 
beating the one-meter record 
while just missing the three-
meter record by a few points.
“This has been my best 
year so far, as I was hoping it 
would be being my last year 
here,” Fatsi said. “Our confer-
ence has gotten pretty strong 
since I was a freshman. Teams 
that used to be guaranteed 
wins [for us] suddenly have 
some great divers and fast 
swimmers. With so many 
freshman on the team, it’ll 
be nice to set the bar high for 
them.”
The women’s volleyball 
team attended the swim and 
dive meet to support their fel-
low Tartan athletes.
“It was my ?rst time watch-
ing a diving competition,” 
said Amy Friedman, a sopho-
more architecture major and 
defensive specialist on the 
volleyball team. “It was amaz-
ing to see the complex dives.”
The Tartans will be com-
peting this Saturday at the 
University of Pittsburgh. The 
meet is scheduled to begin at 
11:30 a.m.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Super Bowl XLVI Preview
CARL GLAZER
Junior Staffwriter
Super Bowls de?ne ca-
reers: They separate good 
players from great players. As 
we look toward Super Bowl 
XLVI, we look at crossroads in 
the careers of two very differ-
ent quarterbacks. Tom Brady, 
the New England Patriots’ 
veteran quarterback, will face 
Eli Manning, the New York 
Giants’ quarterback and little 
brother of Indianapolis Colts’ 
quarterback Peyton Manning.
Brady is the golden boy 
who was picked 199th in the 
NFL draft and wasn’t even a 
full-time starter in college, 
while Manning is a high-ped-
igree, four-year college starter 
who has struggled to step out 
of his famous family’s shadow.
Walking off the ?eld in Su-
per Bowl XLII, Manning was 
the top player and had just 
completed one of the great-
est upsets of all time. Brady, 
meanwhile, was handed a 
crushing defeat that still stings 
him today. On that night, both 
of their career paths changed 
completely. Brady lost his 
aura of invincibility and Man-
ning gained the respect and 
recognition he had been ?ght-
ing for throughout his career.
Now, four years later, we 
are looking at another career-
changing moment for these 
two quarterbacks. On Sunday 
night, their legacies will be 
even more tied together, for-
ever linked.
This game will change not 
only how people will view 
each of them, but also how 
people view at Super Bowl 
XLII. This is a rare opportu-
nity to rewrite history. This 
Sunday, Brady and Manning 
are not just playing for them-
selves but for their legacies, 
along with the legacies of 
those connected to them — 
past and present.
A win on Sunday would al-
low Manning to take another 
huge step out of his brother’s 
shadow. He would solidify 
his preseason claim of being 
an elite quarterback in the 
league and silence most of his 
critics. 
Winning another Super 
Bowl would turn Manning 
into one of the best clutch 
quarterbacks of all time, forc-
ing people to focus on his re-
cord-setting 15 fourth-quar-
ter touchdowns and his 110 
fourth-quarter passing rating. 
Another Super Bowl win and 
people would no longer be 
debating whether he deserves 
the Pro Bowl, but rather if he 
is worthy of the Hall of Fame.
However, a loss would add 
doubt. Losing would increase 
suspicions that 2007 was a 
?uke. Falling to the Patriots 
would devalue all the work he 
has done to become his own 
person and not just Peyton’s 
little brother. Defeat would 
leave Manning in the catego-
ry of good NFL quarterbacks, 
not great ones.
Winning for Brady would 
mean being considered one 
of the best quarterbacks of all 
time. With a win, Brady would 
prove that defense doesn’t 
win championships — record-
breaking quarterback play 
and great tight ends do. Vic-
tory would show that Brady 
doesn’t need superb coaches 
or receivers to achieve great-
ness. With a victory in India-
napolis, the ghosts of 2007 
would fade away.
On the other hand, a loss 
would show decline. A defeat 
would leave Brady’s record 
barely over .500 in the play-
offs since 2006, after starting 
his career 10-0. 
Losing would make people 
question if Brady is a good 
enough quarterback to win 
big games on his own, with-
out a great defensive or offen-
sive talent to back him up. A 
loss would have critics ques-
tioning if Brady was coasting 
on his former glory.
This Sunday, the legacies 
of two men will be changed 
forever. Between the funny 
commercials and the lavish 
halftime performance, these 
quarterbacks will ?ght for 
how history and critics will 
view them.
In the end, it may be out 
of their hands as they watch 
hopelessly from the sidelines. 
But after it’s all over, when 
one is raising the Vince Lom-
bardi trophy and the other is 
sulking in the locker room, 
both of their paths will be 
changed.
The winner will have si-
lenced the critics and proved 
his worth; the loser will have 
a new chorus of doubters 
questioning if he’s worth the 
praise.
Tartans defeat NYU Violets

Sports Co-Editor
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team is 
about three-fourths of the 
way through the 2011–2012 
season, and the team sits on 
a record of 7–11 (2–5 in UAA 
play).
The Tartans’ shooting and 
offensive execution is a key 
determinant of wins and loss-
es. Dating back to last season, 
they won 15 regular-season 
games in a row when shoot-
ing above 50 percent from the 
?oor. Last Friday, the Tartans 
upset the New York University 
Violets by shooting 55 percent 
from the ?eld. However, in 
the previous four games — 
which were all defeats — the 
Tartans shot just 44.1 percent.
“In those games we lost 
I would say our main issue 
was  a lack of execution,” said 
sophomore guard Marshall 
Massengale. “In the games 
we won, we played as one co-
hesive unit, sharing the ball 
offensively.”
Despite the sub-.500 re-
cord, the younger members 
on the team seem to be creat-
ing a promising season.
Sophomore forward Chris-
tian Manoli and sophomore 
guard Rashaun Riley lead the 
Tartans in scoring with 11.6 
and 11.5 points per game, 
respectively. Manoli’s 4.8 re-
bounds per game, 35 assists, 
and 10 blocks rank third on 
the team, putting together 
a well-rounded stat line this 
season.
Riley is shooting 49 per-
cent from the ?eld, including 
45.5 percent from the three-
point line. While those num-
bers also place him third on 
the team, he has shot the ball 
signi?cantly more than his 
two teammates with higher 
percentages.
Sophomore guard Asad 
Meghani is also contributing 
to the Tartans’ rising records. 
He is averaging 8.0 points per 
game on 43.9 percent shoot-
ing, and an astounding 47.6 
percent from behind the arc. 
His 16 points in the Tartans’ 
victory over the Violets led 
the team.
In addition to the younger 
team members, senior guard 
John Duhring is performing 
well during his last season for 
the Tartans, averaging 10.9 
points per game and 4.9 re-
bounds per game. In the up-
set over the Violets, Duhring 
poured in 15 points, shooting 
six of seven from the ?eld. 
During the four-game los-
ing streak before the Tartans’ 
victory over NYU, Duhring 
averaged just 7.25 points. His 
production on offense is prov-
ing essential to the basketball 
team’s victories.
“John is a great leader be-
cause he leads by example, 
works hard in practice, and 
steps up in some games when 
we really need him,” Massen-
gale said.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
lost to the Brandeis University 
Judges with a score of 80–67. 
Manoli scored 21 points, 
while junior guard Andre 
Moore added a career-high 
19 points. However, the poor 
shooting remains a trend in 
the team’s losses, as Carnegie 
Mellon shot only 39.7 per-
cent from the ?eld during the 
game. Allowing the Judges to 
shoot 58.3 percent hurt the 
Tartans even more.
With only conference 
games remaining, if the Tar-
tans step up, they could make 
a statement in UAA play. From 
now until Feb. 25, when Carn-
egie Mellon closes out the sea-
son against Case Western Re-
serve University, the Tartans 
will play ?ve out of seven of 
those UAA games at home in 
Skibo Gymnasium.

SPORTS COMMENTARYMalkin heads the Pens’ hot streak
ADAM GRUBER
Sports Co-Editor
With the All-Star weekend 
in the rear-view mirror, the 
Pittsburgh Penguins come 
back to their regular season 
with a seven-game winning 
streak. Before this streak, 
the Penguins had a six-game 
losing streak, which left fans 
groveling for the return of 
captain Sidney Crosby, who 
is on the disabled list with a 
concussion. For avid follow-
ers, the leader of the Pen-
guins’ surge is by no means 
a mystery. Center and alter-
nate captain Evgeni Malkin’s 
dominance on the ice has the 
Penguins playing their best 
hockey of the 2011–12 sea-
son.
Malkin, being a four-time 
All-Star and former NHL 
Rookie of the Year, is not sur-
prising anybody with his ex-
cellent play. The expectations 
for Malkin are extremely 
high, especially while Crosby 
is still on the disabled list. 
For the Penguins to succeed 
without Crosby, Malkin has 
to lead this team.
Throughout this seven-
game streak of victories — 
including big wins against 
the Florida Panthers, St. 
Louis Blues, and New York 
Rangers — Malkin has been 
in the center of the offense. 
He scored a goal in all but 
one of the seven games, scor-
ing in the shootout of the last 
game. During this streak, he 
is averaging 1.87 points and 
1.29 goals per game.
Even with the Penguins’ 
success guided by Malkin, 
no one would ever question 
Crosby’s position as the cap-
tain and leader of the team 
— until now. Crosby is cur-
rently seeing a doctor in Cali-
fornia to rehabilitate from his 
recurring concussions, while 
Malkin has the Penguins put-
ting together an unbelievable 
string of wins. Maybe it is 
time to take the captain title 
away from Crosby and let 
Malkin wear the “C” on his 
jersey.
Before Penguins fans have 
a tantrum, let me provide 
some clari?cation. I know 
how much Crosby means to 
the team and to Pittsburgh. 
I know, when healthy, that 
Crosby is the best player in 
the NHL. However, the caveat 
in his greatness is his health. 
In just seven seasons, Crosby 
has missed 120 games, pri-
marily due to concussions. It 
doesn’t matter how dominant 
a player he is if he isn’t on the 
ice.
When Crosby is playing, 
he makes the Penguins bet-
ter — I am not disputing 
that. But given the state of 
the team, Crosby’s health, 
and Malkin’s play, why not 
make Malkin the captain? It 
is just a title, but Malkin has 
earned that title. Team own-
ers Mario Lemieux and Ron 
Burkle, as well as head coach 
Dan Bylsma, hold the right to 
give captaincy back to Crosby 
if they desire, but while he 
is rehabilitating on the West 
Coast, they should pay Mal-
kin his dues.
I understand that the 
captain’s job includes speak-
ing to the referees, an aspect 
that the Russian-born Malkin 
might struggle with. This is 
a valid concern, but the Pen-
guins have alternate captains. 
Malkin is the point leader 
this season, even after miss-
ing seven games this season. 
He is leading the Penguins’ 
rise to the top in the Eastern 
Conference. They now ?nd 
themselves ranked ?fth, af-
ter hovering in and out of the 
playoff picture.
I pondered the prospects 
of Bylsma and the owners let-
ting Crosby leave or trading 
him to open up cap space, but 
the NHL is as much a busi-
ness as it is a competition. His 
popularity in Pittsburgh is un-
matched by any other hockey 
player, so perhaps I should 
put a halt to my thoughts of 
demoting Crosby. If he comes 
back with another hockey 
team, reemerges as the great-
est player in the game today, 
and stays healthy, I will have 
to bite my tongue — so hard, 
that I would bite it off.
For now, regardless of 
how strong the love for Cros-
by is in this city, the Penguins 
should stick with a winning 
strategy: Put the “C” on Mal-
kin’s chest.
Tartans take a bite out of the Big Apple
KATIE KNOX
Junior Staffwriter
After winning ?ve of its 
?rst 10 non-conference games 
this season, the women’s bas-
ketball team is making im-
provements from last season’s 
2–23 record.
The start of the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
conference, however, was a 
reminder that the Tartans and 
new head coach Jacqueline 
Hullah still have a long road 
ahead of them before return-
ing to the upper echelon of the 
UAA.
The women’s basketball 
team has continued its strug-
gle to ?nd conference success 
as the team lost its ?rst ?ve 
UAA games, which included 
losses to three top-10, na-
tionally-ranked teams: Uni-
versity of Chicago, University 
of Rochester, and Washing-
ton University in St. Louis. In 
those ?ve games, the Tartans 
were outscored by an average 
of 22 points.
According to ?rst-year 
guard Gabrielle West, the 
team’s focus is ?nishing the 
remaining month of the sea-
son on a high note.
“The mentality of the team 
in this ?nal month of the sea-
son is one of hunger,” West 
said. “We have come so far 
and learned so much from 
the beginning of the season to 
now, and we really want to put 
all of the ?nishing touches to-
gether to get some wins in our 
conference.”
This past Friday night, that 
hunger was momentarily sa-
tiated as the Tartans earned 
their ?rst conference win of 
the season and broke their 
four-game losing streak with 
a 65–48 win over New York 
University. The win moved the 
Tartans to an overall record of 
7–10.
Leading the offensive at-
tack against the NYU Violets 
were West and junior forward 
Emily Peel.
West ?nished the game 
with 15 points, while Peel led 
with 18 points. Sophomore 
guard Jacqueline Shaw also 
had quite a night, recording 
her second double-double of 
the season with 10 points and 
10 boards.
In order to carry the mo-
mentum from Friday’s contest 
into the season’s remaining 
games, the team will rely on 
defensive consistency and 
look to leading scorers Peel 
and West to maintain their 
shooting inside the paint and 
beyond the arc.
Peel is among the top 10 
in eight statistical categories 
of the UAA, which include 
her 15.5 points (second), 
9.8 rebounds (second), and 
1.9 blocks (?rst) per game. 
She has also been named the 
UAA Athlete of the Week two 
times this season and has 
even gained a place on the 
D3hoops.com Team of the 
Week. The website recognizes 
top performances on the bas-
ketball court across Division-
III colleges. 
Guided by the leadership 
of Peel and other upperclass-
men, West has quickly made 
the transition to college-level 
basketball and has found a 
way to make consistent contri-
butions to the Tartans, espe-
cially on the offensive end of 
the ?oor.
“At this caliber of play, 
most of the game is mental,” 
West said. “At the end of the 
day, you just have to go out on 
the court and play basketball 
for the love of the game.”
West is second on the team 
in scoring, with 12.9 points 
per game. Her 40.2 percent 
shooting from beyond the 
three-point line is ranked sec-
ond on the team as well.
The Tartans return home 
this weekend to open up the 
second round of conference 
play.
The stage will be set on 
Friday and Saturday in Skibo 
Gymnasium for rematches 
against NYU and Brandeis 
University, which the team 
faced yesterday in a 56–67 
loss.

ATHLETE PROFILE
Fatsi makes last splashes as a Tartan
Jonathan Carreon/Photo Editor
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
As senior diver Eli Fatsi competes 
in his last season on the men’s swim-
ming and diving team, he re?ected on 
his athletic career at Carnegie Mellon. 
Fatsi is earning his bachelor’s degree 
in the Mellon College of Science as a 
math major.
Fatsi’s interest in swimming and 
diving began at a young age.
“All the neighborhood kids were on 
the swim team at the local pool every 
summer back in elementary school,” 
Fatsi said. “Swimming was way too 
hard, so I dove for a few years back 
then.”
Despite this interest, Fatsi did not 
start diving competitively until his 
junior year of high school, when he 
joined the team with his friend. “It was 
just for fun. I never thought I would 
actually be diving in college,” he said.
As a Carnegie Mellon athlete, Fatsi 
felt that being on a varsity team was 
a particularly rewarding experience. 
“It’s been awesome being a part of 
something for all four years [of col-
lege] but still having the time to enjoy 
everything else I love to do,” he said. 
“Seeing how far we’ve all progressed 
since we showed up as freshmen, it’s 
pretty remarkable.”
Fatsi has made a lot of progress 
since his ?rst year at college; he even 
made nationals last year. With this 
feat, the diver now has lofty goals for 
himself during his ?nal season. “Per-
sonally, I’m shooting for nationals; fel-
low senior Mike Alexovich and I made 
cuts last year, but didn’t make it to the 
meet,” Fatsi said. 
Speci?cally, Fatsi has high expec-
tations for the team and has set tre-
mendous personal goals for the rest of 
the season. “With so many freshman 
on the team, it would be great to take 
second place at UAA’s again and set 
the standard for them,” Fatsi said. “If 
Emory wasn’t so darn ridiculous, ?rst 
place would be the goal, but they’re 
incredible.”
Fatsi explained that post-gradua-
tion he will primarily miss being on an 
athletic team. “I can’t imagine I’ll be 
around diving at all once I graduate, 
so I’ll clearly miss that. It’s kind of a kid 
sport,” he said.
Re?ecting on the team’s leader-
ship, Fatsi noted that he will also miss 
the diving coach after the season is 
over. “My coach, Alicia Gorman, is in-
credible as well. It’ll be sad not to have 
her around looking out for me,” Fatsi 
said.
Gorman agreed, saying that she 
will miss having Fatsi on the team. 
“Eli brings a lot of fun and focus to 
our team,” Gorman said. “Over the 
past four years he has pushed himself 
to the next level on a daily basis. He 
is a hard worker and all of his work is 
paying off. He always comes to prac-
tice with a smile and has fun no matter 
what he is doing. He has been a true 
pleasure to coach and I have enjoyed 
seeing him reach his goals.”
Fatsi re?ected on his proudest 
moment throughout the course of 
his athletic career: “Last year, senior 
Mike Alexovich and I took down the 
school records last year at UAAs. He 
got the one-meter record and I took 
the three-meter one; we’ve both been 
the perfect competition for each other 
over the years, so taking down the re-
cords together was a pretty awesome 
moment.”
After graduation, Fatsi wants to 
cater to his adventurous side by ski-
ing, mountain biking, kayaking, back-
packing, and climbing in Colorado. He 
would also like put his degree in math 
to good use. “I would like to make 
money programming somehow, like 
Aron Ralston but hopefully not too 
much like Aron Ralston,” he joked.

Artist uses body as medium
Wafaa Bilal tests physical endurance through artwork 
Looking at Wafaa Bilal — clad in a gray sweater, pink 
collared shirt, and dress pants — you would never 
guess that he spent the past year with a camera 
surgically implanted in the back of his head as an 
artistic endeavor. The first artist of the College of 
Fine Arts’ spring lecture series, Bilal delivered his 
presentation to a nearly-packed Kresge Theater 
last Monday. Bilal gave an hour-long presentation 
explaining the intentions behind many of his pieces, 
then opened up the presentation for questions for 
half an hour. As an Iraqi-born artist, many of his 
pieces deal with challenging social and political 
comfort zones and with confronting reality. He 
consistently uses his own body as a medium, 
manipulating and even endangering himself for his 
art.
In 2007, Bilal gained initial publicity with a project 
called “Domestic Tension,” in which he lived in a 
make-shift room in a Chicago gallery with a paintball 
gun for 31 days. Video of him was streamed live 
online so viewers could control the movement of 
the gun and fire at will. Bilal released daily video-
logs describing his emotional ride throughout the 
process. When the project’s publicity grew, the gun 
would sometimes fire non-stop. The project was a 
commentary on American warfare, examining the 
lack of physical or psychological contact that modern 
technology provides. This audience interaction is 
one of the most provocative elements of his artwork.
When Bilal puts himself in extreme situations, the 
audience becomes a crucial element in the artwork. 
When asked about how audience interaction added 
to his past pieces he responded, “I am in a situation, 
and the interaction could change that situation.” 
Bilal claimed that one of the hardest parts of being 
an artist is to step back and let things unfold. 
Responding to a question about why he endured 
so much physical pain in his pieces, he shared 
that he was interested in triggering something in 
his viewers’ bodies. He has noticed that there is 
a certain point when his viewers begin to feel the 
same pain he feels.
Bilal’s level of physical endurance was tested in 2010 
with a project titled “And Counting.” It honored 
deceased Iraqi troops, including his own brother who 
was killed by a missile in their hometown of Kufa, 
Iraq. He made a statement about the invisibility 
of Iraqi civilian deaths by first having a borderless 
map of Iraq tattooed on his back, followed by 5,000 
red dots representing fallen American soldiers and 
100,000 dots in permanent invisible ink representing 
the deaths of Iraqi civilians. The entire process took 
20 hours to complete. The dots of invisible ink are 
only seen under a black light, where they emerge as 
an eerie layer of luminous blue all across his back. 
In the videos of the process, Bilal remains cool and 
collected — even after hours of tattooing, his hands 
are steady.
His most recent project, “The 3rd I,” involved 
surgical attachment of a camera to the back of his 
head. For an entire year, starting Dec. 15, 2010, 
this camera streamed an image every minute to 
the project’s website and provided his exact GPS 
location. Through this project, Bilal wanted to 
examine the places that humans leave behind as 
their fixation on the future becomes increasingly 
central to their lives.
The audience’s reaction to these controversial and 
abnormal pieces was surprisingly positive.
“He was the most down-to-earth performance artist 
that I’ve ever seen speak,” said first-year electrical 
and computer engineering major Canute Haroldson. 
The questions asked by audience members lacked 
criticism of the art, and instead were genuine 
inquiries about his opinions and processes.
When an audience member asked how his work will 
change when Iraq is less prominent on the American 
radar, he responded that it is an issue he cannot 
distance himself from. However, he does not want 
to be “the one looking for the next war, the next 
tragedy.” He claimed that his work will be shifting 
slowly in the next few years.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I’m graduating in a few 
months and already have 
a job offer. Basically, 
I’m just killing time until 
graduation. But now I 
have nothing to do. What 
can I do to make the best 
of my last few months in 
Pittsburgh?
Thanks,

Dear SLACKER,
Now is your chance to finally 
enjoy Pittsburgh. Everyone 
at Carnegie Mellon loves 
to hate on the ’Burgh, 
lamenting about how terrible 
it is. They’re all liars and I 
hate them. Pittsburgh is 
awesome, and they’re just 
too miserable to enjoy it. 
Get your crew together and 
start skipping class — it’s 
time to take advantage of 
the ’Burgh. You’ve probably 
done typical tourist-y 
things, like going up the 
Monongahela Incline and 
spending way too much 
time in Squirrel Hill and 
Shadyside. Now’s the time 
to go to South Side. There 
are bars as far as the eye 
can see, and it’s not the 
usual college crowd. You’ll 
have an unforgettable 
evening — or a very 
forgettable one, depending 
on how many bars.
Or just stay inside and 
complain,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I love to dance, but when 
I do, I’m super awkward. 
All my friends tell me not 
to, and I always get weird 
looks when I go out on 
the dance floor. How can I 
be a better dancer?
Thanks,

Dear TWO LEFT FEET,
I am a firm believer that no 
one actually knows what 
they’re doing when they 
dance. Alcohol is the only 
thing that separates most 
parties from those middle 
school dances with guys 
on one side of the room 
and girls on the other. After 
enough to drink, everyone’s 
on the dance floor making 
a fool of themselves, so just 
go out there and have fun. 
The fact of the matter is, 
your friends are projecting 
their insecurities onto you. 
Frankly, you can dance if 
you want to. You can leave 
your friends behind. ‘Cause 
your friends don’t dance 
and if they don’t dance, well, 
they’re no friends of mine.
S-s-s-s A-a-a-a F-f-f-f

My journey into Rome was a little less enchanting than 
I had ?rst imagined. The cab ride from the airport to 
my apartment took me on a tour of the Eternal City that 
mostly showed me graf?ti and garbage — not quite the 
romantic image I had from movies and television shows. 
Don’t get me wrong, Rome certainly has its locales of 
pure beauty, but I was shocked to see beautiful, neo-
classical buildings defaced with signs of anarchy and 
vulgar statements about rival football (soccer) teams.
But I thought to myself: This is a big city, and graf?ti 
and trash dominate all big cities. I had gone to Rome 
to take in all that it had to offer, so I decided to let the 
defacement slide and focus on the positives.
Living 10 minutes from St. Peter’s Square had its 
perks — namely, I was living 10 minutes from St. 
Peter’s Square. It was unreal that I could walk over and 
people-watch in front of the most important building 
in the entire Catholic faith. On one Sunday afternoon, I 
joined thousands of people in the square to watch the 
Pope speak from his window. Regardless of religious 
beliefs, the experience was something that words can’t 
adequately describe.
Geographically, I lived in the northwest part of the city. 
The area was mostly residential, as the tourist hot-spots 
were across the river and surrounding the center. The 
subway system de?nitely had its advantage of getting 
across central Rome, but only having two lines is a 
bit limiting. For example, there are no stops going to 
Trastevere, a popular nightlife part of town ?lled with 
restaurants, pubs, and nightclubs. This could have been 
a blessing in disguise, however. Rome is not exactly 
the worst city to walk around in. Passing by the Castel 
Sant’Angelo and the colossal Palazzaccio — the local 
courthouse with the affectionate nickname of the “Evil 
Palace” — on a night out made every journey to the 
clubs a little more scenic.
One of the biggest differences I noticed about daily life 
was the prevalence of outdoor markets. Whether the 
vendors were selling fruit, clothes, books, or trinkets, 
every other block seemed to have a tent or two offering 
anything and everything. The grandfather of outdoor 
markets, without a doubt, was Porta Portese. In south-
central Rome, this outdoor market only occurs in the 
early hours of Sunday mornings, but it is certainly 
worth a visit. It’s about a mile long, with a side street 
connecting to another half-mile stretch of tents. There 
are lots of hidden treasures — like ?ve ties for ?ve 
euros — if you are patient enough to stroll through the 
market’s entirety.
While in Rome, I saw all the famous sights, but I also 
discovered one of Rome’s best-kept secrets: Dolce 
Maniera. It’s a bakery that’s open 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week. Only 10 minutes from my apartment, it 
was a popular pit stop on my way home after a night 
out. Fifty-euro-cent Nutella-?lled donuts always satis?ed 
my 3 a.m. sweet-tooth cravings. At the end of my time 
abroad, and with a 4:30 a.m. ?ight back to the United 
States, this bakery was the site of my last meal in Rome 
— and I wouldn’t have had it any other way.
Another little-known locale is a Steelers bar. Yes, all the 
way over in Italy is a small bar called La Botticella that 
shows every Steelers game live on a projection screen. 
This certainly was a nice taste of home. In May 2009, the 
bar was featured in an article in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette with information about the bar and an interview 
with the owner.
On one of my last days, I took the ?rst subway ride of 
the morning at 5:30 a.m. to see some of the popular 
monuments without the swarming crowd of tourists. 
Someone had recommended this to me, and it was 
certainly worth waking up so early. The beautiful thing 
about Rome is that all of the major landmarks are within 
walking distance of each other.
I started at my favorite spot, Trevi Fountain, and there 
were only a handful of people there. A few minutes down 
the road was the Colosseum with just one other person 
walking around. When I made my way to the Spanish 
Steps, there wasn’t a soul. The most popular tourist 
spots, the main pedestrian boulevards, and the subway 
stations were all deserted. In a city of almost 3 million 
people and thousands of tourists every day, it’s de?nitely 
not something you see often.
Now that I’m back in Pittsburgh, I still wonder if those 
few months in Rome really happened. When I walk 
outside, I see the Cathedral of Learning, but just a few 
months ago I would have seen the dome of St. Peter’s 
Basilica. It was hard to grasp while I was there, but 
being home and seeing a map — knowing exactly where 
my apartment was, tracing my daily route to school, 
following the river to the major monuments — reminds 
me that it was real, and it’s an experience I’ll never 
forget.

On East Liberty Quarters
Last Saturday, a funk trio played in Pittsburgh.
For some reason, in the late ’80s, we cast off the funky 
sounds that the synthesizers of the era were beckoning 
to produce. Much like a lost balloon, it seems that the 
funk never left Earth’s orbit, but has instead been hanging 
out beyond the exosphere, drenching itself in alpha rays. 
Repeated exposure to these rays has resulted in the funk 
spiraling downward into the troposphere and, as a result, 
we’ve recently been hearing the heaviest of futuristic funks 
radiating from cities like Los Angeles and Pittsburgh.
Last night, members of WRCT’s experimental physics 
department made an excursion to lower Lawrenceville, 
where there seemed to be a radioactive disturbance. 
As they approached the Thunderbird Cafe, the readings 
on their Geiger counter were off the charts. It turns out 
the spikes in radioactivity were the result of an ELQ 
performance.
ELQ, formally known as East Liberty Quarters, a local 
future-funk group, has been creating quite a stir with 
its performances in Pittsburgh. The group has been 
revealing an intricate synthesizer-based funk that it has 
been composing in the studio, and it is impressing a good 
number of well-to-do Pittsburghers. The trio is comprised 
of Grand Ear, Nice Rec, and Buscrates 16 Bit Ensemble. 
On Friday, during their performance at the Thunderbird 
Cafe, they were accompanied on guitar by Zachary Curl of 
the Smooth Tutors.
The show was a blast. The funk radiated in a fashion 
kindred to that of Dâm-Funk, the self-proclaimed Los 
Angeles-based “Ambassador of Boogie Funk.” ELQ played  
a hypnotic array of songs that got a packed two-and-a-
half-story bar grooving. Given last night’s performance, 
one can only expect that the power and exploration in their 
repertoire will be growing.

PSO plays Hollywood classics
Guest conductor Marvin Hamlisch wins over audience
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) had its 
opening performance of “Marvin and the Movies,” 
which paid tribute to some of the most famous 
Hollywood movie scores of all time, last Thursday at 
Heinz Hall. The orchestra — conducted by four-
time Grammy winner Marvin Hamlisch — was 
accompanied by the All-Star College Choir for four 
songs at the beginning of the show and by seven-
time Grammy nominee saxophonist Dave Koz at the 
end of the show.
After the lights dimmed, Hamlisch stepped onto the 
stage to join the orchestra and greeted the audience 
with the casual air of an old friend. “You know, this is 
the perfect time for this show,” he said, “because the 
Academy Awards are coming up.”
Then, after making a joke about how almost no 
one in the audience had seen the nine nominated 
movies, he commented, “Movies have the power 
to touch our lives,” and led the orchestra in a short 
medley that combined “The Murder” from Psycho 
with “Tara’s Theme” from Gone With the Wind.
The second song of the evening was “A Salute to 
Gene Kelly,” featuring musical pieces from the best-
loved scores of Kelly’s movies. The light-hearted 
medley, which included “Singing in the Rain,” 
was coupled with playful theatrics for an enjoyable 
performance.
The most highly anticipated portion of the night 
came after intermission when Koz joined the 
orchestra. His on-stage personality was as suave and 
vibrant as the smooth jazz he unleashed from his 
instrument.
Koz was quick to charm the audience, playing a 
brassy rendition of one of Hollywood’s greatest 
love songs, “Moon River,” which he credited as 
being perhaps his favorite melody of all time. The 
saxophonist even granted the audience the pleasure 
of hearing him sing a line of the famous song.
After performances of “The Pink Panther” and 
“Over the Rainbow,” the orchestra began to play a 
piecemeal composition of the music from the James 
Bond ?lm series. The musicians had barely played 
three notes, however, when Hamlisch interrupted 
the performance. “Wait, this doesn’t feel right,” 
Hamlisch explained, picking up a white jacket from 
atop the grand piano. The audience responded with 
cheers as Hamlisch helped Koz to slip into the iconic 
piece of Bond-esque attire.
“The name’s Koz. Dave Koz,” the saxophonist joked.
After interrupting the music just once more to hand 
Koz a drink — “shaken, not stirred” — Hamlisch let 
the medley recommence with a ?ick of his baton.
Straying from the night’s theme of movie scores, Koz 
treated the audience to performances of two of his 
original pieces, “Cuban Highway” and “You Make 
Me Smile.” The visual experience of watching Koz 
play his music was as stimulating as the acoustics: 
his shoulders rising with the notes of a peaking 
melody, his patent leather shoes never planted 
solidly on the ?oor, back arching, legs bowing. The 
music invaded his limbs. Koz received a standing 
ovation after dropping to one knee to play a complex 
segment of “You Make Me Smile.”
Another highlight of the evening was seeing some 
of Carnegie Mellon’s own students perform as part 
of the All-Star College Choir. After some songs, 
Hamlisch stopped to have onstage chats with 
randomly chosen members of the choir. For example, 
after the choir’s performance of “The Trolley 
Song” from Meet Me in St. Louis, Hamlisch teased 
sophomore Hannah Marks when she shared that she 
is a vocal performance major. “A person who doesn’t 
need any money. Right here, ladies and gentlemen,” 
Hamlisch joked.
Sophomore voice major Kati Richer was also called 
out by Hamlisch. When asked whether she found the 
music of Hollywood classics old-fashioned, Richer 
responded, “I love this music. It’s timeless.”

Audience members were met with twists and surprises 
with the School of Music’s production of Maurice Ravel’s 
short yet provocative L’enfant et les sortilèges. Opening 
last Thursday and running through the weekend, an 
intriguing fantasy land ?lled the Philip Chosky Theater in 
the Purnell Center for the Arts.
With a score by Ravel, libretto by Sidonie-Gabrielle 
Colette, and English translation by Katharine Wolff, 
L’enfant et les sortilèges, or The Child and the Magic 
Spells, follows the chimerical journey of a de?ant young 
boy. After turning his room upside down in a hysterical 
?t, the child’s inanimate household objects come to life 
to teach him a lesson. Much to his horror and surprise, 
the child is ?ung into a world of fantasy not unlike those 
of Alice in Wonderland or Beauty and the Beast.
However, the School of Music’s interpretation 
differentiates itself from these romps through bold 
artistic choices. Directed by Greg Lehane — a professor 
in the schools of drama and music — and musically 
directed and conducted by Andres Cladera — who 
received his master’s degree in orchestral conducting 
from Carnegie Mellon — L’enfant highlights the horror 
that mixes with delight in the blurred line between 
reality and childhood imaginings. Reveling in this darker 
side of the fantastical world, the production team and 
cast crafted a piece that offered a goth, punk twist to the 
characters.
The performers, dressed in gothic plaid, chains, ?shnets, 
and Rocky Horror-esque makeup, were challenged to 
embody a harsher tone than is usually seen in the opera 
that began as a “fairy ballet.” A logistically dif?cult opera 
to begin with, L’enfant was also challenging in terms of 
casting needs, orchestration, and avoiding similarities 
to Disney’s tales of happy anthropomorphic toys and 
dancing objects.
Drama master’s students Britton Mauk and Lindsey 
Vandevier developed the phantasmagoric feel of the set 
and costume pieces, respectively. Their work created 
an eerie tone for the journey through the bizarre world 
of a child’s fantastical imaginings. However, while the 
essence of this absurdity did ?nd its way into the piece, 
the potential to make L’enfant truly frightening was 
not completely realized. Despite attention to musical 
intricacies and spirited performances, the cheeriness 
of the music created a disconnect between the desired 
tone and the ?nal effect.
The production was entertaining nonetheless and 
featured some stand-out performances. Senior voice 
major Gillian Hassert’s presence as The Mother 
commanded attention from the moment she stepped 
onstage. The humor and clowning moments of The 
Clock (senior voice major Martin Schreiner) as well as the 
Teapot (senior voice major Sean Pack) and The Chinese 
Cup (senior voice major Katherine Brandt) also stood out.
The strong physicality and comedic instincts of senior 
voice major Piers Portfolio’s Black Cat stole the show. 
The pairing with senior voice major Kathleen Grif?n’s 
White Cat was delightful.
In the opening sequences, some of The Child’s (played 
by senior voice major Lauren Boyle on Thursday night) 
moments of discovery seemed contrived, while others 
seemed refreshingly genuine as the audience was 
allowed to discover with him; furthermore, vocal overlaps 
at the beginning and end of the piece with The Princess 
(senior voice major Meghan Gatti) were particularly 
striking, showing vocal strength. Senior voice majors 
Gaelyn Elliott Young, Tyler Alderson, and Fiona Ryder 
also gave particularly memorable performances.
And these moments contributed to making the show a 
night of fun for Carnegie Mellon students.
“To me, this production was de?nitely more enjoyable 
than the other operas that I have seen [here],” said 
sophomore music composition major Sean Salamon. 
“Much of this was due to the quality of the writing,” 
he added, “[as] the libretto avoided many [frustrating] 
common conceits of opera.” Sophomore voice major 
Scott Cuva agreed, “I was both shocked and amazed 
with how brilliantly written and performed this opera 
was. It is easily my favorite Carnegie Mellon opera I’ve 
seen to date.”
With regard to the production’s dark interpretation, 
some audience members found the choices to be more 
successful than others did. “There are two ways to 
approach this opera: comically overdone or tangibly 
dark,” Cuva added. “I believe the decision to do the latter 
was an extremely poignant decision on the part of the 
director.”
Design choices were speci?cally noted as successful in 
the play’s darker approach. First-year dramaturgy major 
Meg Martinez particularly enjoyed the strong aesthetics. 
“It really appeared to be the child’s dream world,” she 
said, “[and] was tinged by his guilt for what he had 
done.”
Others, such as senior directing major Christian Fleming, 
saw the opportunity for stronger choices to be made. 
“I think the choice to create a darker, more frightening 
world for the child to wind up in makes a lot of sense,” 
he said.
Regardless of the ?nal effect, the choices engaged 
audience members and made them think. Opera, 
some of the performers said, gets a bad rap, and that’s 
something they wish would change.
Sophomore voice major and L’enfant ensemble 
member James Alexander focused on the storytelling 
opportunities opera creates. “I wish people knew 
how accessible it is. Opera is, like every art form, a 
representation of human emotion or analysis,” he 
explained. “The word ‘opera’ has a reputation for 
implying something is old, or haughty, but the things 
Puccini and Mozart wrote about are still very real, and 
still apply to us now.”
Hassert shared the sentiment: “I wish people knew that 
underneath concepts, loud voices, and occasionally 
women in horns with spears, opera is really just about 
telling moving stories ... and making people think.”

Kresge Theatre was ?lled with an eager audience on 
Saturday night who came to see a production of Greeze, 
a musical tribute to the 1970s hit Grease. There was not, 
however, a single musical theater, vocal performance, or 
acting major on stage.
Instead, the performance was by YinzerStar, a group of 
graduate students in the School of Computer Science 
that puts on musicals, joined in this production by 
some friends unaf?liated with the university. The stars 
of the show were temporarily migrating away from 
their computers towards the glitz and glamour of the 
performing arts.
The ambience before the show screamed of the ’50s — 
audience members appeared to be smoking cigarettes 
but upon closer inspection were actually nibbling on 
Victory candy cigarettes, a clever freebie given out by 
the ushers at the door as people ?led in. Musical hits like 
“Lollipop” and “Yakety Yak” played as audience members 
read the playbill and waited for the show to start.
The house ran out of playbills — which included funny 
character fact cards to prepare the audience for the 
world of the play — well before the start of the show, 
suggesting that many more people attended the 
performance than expected. When asked how they found 
out about the performance, most audience members said 
they were students in the School of Computer Science 
or friends of the performers. The show seemed to be a 
well-kept secret, meant to circulate primarily within the 
computer science community.
Some, however, were skeptical that computer science 
Ph.D. students could put on a successful musical, 
something that seemed so contrastive to their usual 
day’s work. “When [my friend] told me there was an SCS 
musical, I was reasonably con?dent he was pulling my 
leg,” said David Franklin, a ?rst-year computer science 
major.
The performers certainly surprised the audience, though.
Nick Benore, who co-directed the musical and played 
Danny Zuko, bore an uncanny resemblance to the 1978 
?lm version’s John Travolta and had the singing and 
acting skills to boot. Co-star Emily Stiehl as Sandy had 
a sweet voice and disposition, charming audience 
members during intermission when she taught them 
the hand jive so they could join in the classic “Born to 
Hand Jive” scene. The actors’ cartwheeling, singing, and 
dancing were de?nitely sights to be seen.
This was YinzerStar’s second show, produced by 
Thomas LaToza, a software engineering Ph.D. student, 
who put on Jesus Christ Yinzerstar with a group of 
computer science Ph.D. students last year. Greeze 
incorporated clever references to last year’s well-
received show, such as inviting back Gus Xia — a Ph.D. 
student in machine learning who played Zealotes last 
year — to be the Teen Angel Advisor and sing a warning 
against becoming a graduate-school dropout.
“We had a lot of fun with [Jesus Christ Yinzerstar], so we 
wanted to do another show,” LaToza said. He added that 
this year, with the lack of an extensive pit orchestra, he 
wanted to choose a show that revolved around a smaller 
band.
Benore said that Greeze was enjoyable to put on 
because of the students involved. “We worked with such 
an enthusiastic group of people,” Benore raved. The 
challenge was balancing schoolwork with rehearsals, 
although Benore pointed out that the cast members did 
a great job doing so — a surprising feat, considering 
the amount of research and work that Ph.D. students 
undertake here.
The close-knit community was evident as the performers 
made many references to Carnegie Mellon’s graduate 
school, sometimes directly addressing the audience in 
jest. Overall, the success of the show and the audience’s 
enjoyment was no doubt due to the enthusiasm of those 
involved in this performance.

This coming-of-age British “dramedy” was released 
in 2010 and marked the directorial debut of Richard 
Ayoade, a popular British comedian. Submarine follows 
Oliver, a teenage boy who is socially awkward but thinks 
he’s secretly a genius. Oliver lives a relatively normal 
life growing up but is soon surrounded by intensely 
emotional events that threaten to shatter his life goals. 
Submarine is a clever tale of the vulnerability that affects 
all of us as we grow up in the cruel adult world. Fun 
Fact: Alex Turner, frontman of The Arctic Monkeys, 
wrote the original songs for the movie.

Imagine a future in which people stop aging at 25. That’s 
the plot of this movie — with a slight twist — which stars 
Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, and Cillian Murphy. 
The twist is that people are only engineered to live 
one more year after 25, and they must earn more time 
through their private lives. So, the wealthier a person 
is, the longer they live. In Time seems to be a more 
modern and dystopian version of Logan’s Run. Fun Fact: 
Despite the fact that everyone is genetically engineered 
to stop aging at 25 in the movie, Seyfried was the only 
signi?cant character who was actually 25 during ?lming.

“
Some 26,000 books, however, fared worse: In 1957, the Israeli 
government deemed that these books “contained inciting materials 
against the State [of Israel]” and recycled them as paper waste.
Members of The Great Book Robbery — which include historians, 
? lmmakers, students, journalists, and many others who advocate on 
behalf of Palestinian causes — seek to take stock of the remaining 
books and identify their owners through a massive digital library, 
which contains 500 of the original 6,000 books labeled as “abandoned 
property.” The Great Book Robbery’s other primary objective is 
education.
Israeli-Dutch ? lmmaker Benny Brunner, a member of The Great 
Book Robbery’s staff who is based in Amsterdam, has made a 
documentary titled The Great Book Robbery, which recounts the 
looting of Palestinian books. The ? lm, which is ? nished and currently 
undergoing editing, will be released in May 2012.
The website for The Great Book Robbery includes a forum section, 
which provides a space for those interested in the project to discuss 
the events of 1948 and to contribute to the discourse concerning 
a wide spectrum of issues pertaining to Palestinian identity and 
culture.
To many Palestinians, especially those who bore witness to the 
events of 1948, The Great Book Robbery is also an effort to reclaim 
Palestinian cultural and ethnic identity. Amit asserted that the 
collection of Palestinian books by Israelis constitutes a theft of 
Palestinian culture. In The Jerusalem Quarterly, he wrote, “This 
untold story of the fate of Palestinian ‘abandoned’ books clearly 
demonstrates how occupation and colonization is not limited to the 
taking over of physical space. Rather, it achieves its ful? llment by 
occupying cultural space as well, and by turning the cultural artifacts 
of the victims into ownerless objects with no past.”
The Great Book Robbery allows for communication and interaction 
among a wide array of individuals interested in the preservation of 
Palestinian culture. As such, its staff, contributors, and supporters 
hail from across the globe. Here in Pittsburgh, University of 
Pittsburgh student Karina Goulordava, vice president of the 
university’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, is lending her 
efforts to The Great Book Robbery.
As part of its staff, Goulordava — graduating this year with a 
bachelor of arts in Spanish, communication-rhetoric, and Arabic — 
plays an important role in disseminating media regarding The Great 
Book Robbery and garnering publicity for the project.
“I’m the communication manager. My primary task is to get publicity 
for the project. On a daily basis, I run our Facebook and Twitter,” 
Goulordava said. “I also scan the internet every once in a while to see 
if any new press has been written about us.”
Goulordava also contacts writers to contribute to the website’s 
forum. She explained the signi? cance of the section: “We contact 
professors, scholars, students, ? lmmakers, journalists, authors, and 
librarians — anyone who has an opinion about The Great Book 
Robbery. They write a piece for us and we publish it on the forum. 
[For] something this important, you don’t want to just put the 
information out there. You want to create a discussion about this, 
and you want to talk about why it is important.”
Individuals here in Pittsburgh have contributed to the discourse, 
thanks to Goulordava’s efforts. Tom Twiss, a librarian from the 
University of Pittsburgh’s Hillman Library, wrote an article for the 
forum titled “The Destruction of Palestinian Library and Cultural 
Resources in 2002.” Goulordava has booked interviews published 
on The Great Book Robbery’s website with Pappé and Palestinian 
academic Ghada Karmi from the University of Exeter in the United 
Kingdom.
The Great Book Robbery does more than illuminate a new aspect of 
a fraught subject; it demonstrates that the events of al-Nakba had 
other consequences than the physical displacement of Palestinians. 
To the members of The Great Book Robbery, Israel uprooted the heart 
of Palestinian academic and intellectual culture. This comprehensive 
initiative pieces together a fragmented history of two nations.

“Farewell, my library! Farewell, the house of wisdom, the abode 
of philosophers, a house and witness for literature! How many 
sleepless nights I spent there, reading and writing, the night is silent 
and the people asleep. Goodbye, my books! I know not what has 
become of you after we left: Were you looted? Burnt? Have you been 
ceremonially transferred to a private or public library? Did you end 
up on the shelves of grocery stores with your pages used to wrap 
onions?”
In this excerpt from That’s the Way I Am, Gentlemen: From the 
Diary of Khalil al-Sakakini, the late Palestinian poet Khalil al-Sakakini 
mourns the loss of his priceless books. Al-Sakakini had ? ed his home 
in the Katamon neighborhood of Jerusalem in the 1948 Arab-Israeli 
War, leaving behind a vast trove of Palestinian literature. He settled 
in Cairo two months later, never to see his beloved books again.
Israelis consider 1948 as the year they fought for independence. 
Meanwhile, Palestinians consider 1948 as the year of al-Nakba, a 
mass exodus of 711,000 to 750,000 Palestinians from their homes.
Al-Sakakini’s story was not unique. Between May 1948 and February 
1949, the nascent state of Israel seized approximately 70,000 books 
belonging to Palestinians as the exodus was occurring. To many 
scholars of the Israel-Palestine con? ict, this initiative was not 
merely a collection of books, but a systematic looting — one that 
represented the theft of Palestinian culture as well.
“What is important about the looting of the books [is that] it is part 
of the appropriation of the cultural essence of this land [Palestine], 
which is not different from the appropriation of the territories, the 
houses, the natural resources, and everything that Palestine had — 
even its history — could be and should have been part of the new 
Jewish state,” said Israeli-Jewish historian Ilan Pappé in the trailer 
for a ? lm documenting al-Nakba.
A new project titled The Great Book Robbery, described as a 
“multifaceted cultural heritage project” on its website, aims to bring 
the story of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and al-Nakba to light, while 
identifying the books’ rightful owners. The project includes the 
production of a documentary ? lm and the creation of a virtual library 
for the books.
The Great Book Robbery began with an accidental discovery. In 
2006, while searching for reference material at the Jewish National 
and University Library at Hebrew University, Israeli graduate student 
Gish Amit stumbled upon documents detailing the plunder of books 
from Palestinian homes. In an article in The Jerusalem Quarterly, 
Amit detailed the transfer of books that took place between 1948 and 
1949 by the staff of the National Library of Israel.
These librarians collected 30,000 books, manuscripts, and 
newspapers from western Jerusalem that were left behind by 
Palestinian denizens during the course of the war and after 
the depopulation of Palestinian villages. They then transferred 
approximately 6,000 of those books to the National Library’s Eastern 
Studies Department and deemed them “abandoned property.” In 
1948 and subsequent years, employees of the Custodian of Absentee 
Property gathered an additional 40,000 to 50,000 books from other 
cities in historic Palestine, including Jaffa, Haifa, Tiberias, and 
Nazareth.

Last Friday, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust held its 
?rst quarterly Gallery Crawl of the year. The Gallery 
Crawl — which includes over 30 venues in 14 
square blocks of the Cultural District — features 
local, national, and international artists and includes 
visual, audio, and performance art.
Darcy Kucenic, director of Highmark First Night 
Pittsburgh and manager of education and operations 
at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, manages the 
Gallery Crawls. She explained, “The winter Crawl 
is probably our smallest in attendance, because 
it’s, you know, winter. But we still get a couple of 
thousand people that come down.”
With so many venues involved and such a large 
number of attendees, planning the event is a long 
and complicated process.
Kucenic, who received her master’s degree in arts 
management from Carnegie Mellon in 2000, works 
with galleries to determine what type of work will 
be shown and then brings everything else together. 
“Based on what new exhibits are open, I manage 
the whole Gallery Crawl process. I invite other 
participating organizations in the district to have 
something and be in the Crawl,” Kucenic said. 
“Every Crawl is different, so it gives me a chance to 
bring in all different kinds of groups.”
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust operates many of the 
galleries within the Cultural District, including Wood 
Street Galleries, Space Gallery, and 707 and 709 
Galleries, among others.
Murray Horne, curator of Wood Street Galleries, 
provided some insight on what it’s like planning 
for the Gallery Crawl from a curatorial standpoint. 
“We’re always preparing a new show to open with 
the Gallery Crawl,” he said. “So it takes us about 
three weeks to prepare for that before the Crawl.”
Wood Street Galleries is known for displaying 
installation work and art based on technology. 
According to Horne, he’s most concerned about 
“the quality of the work and the variety of it” when 
planning exhibits.
For this Gallery Crawl, Norwegian artist HC Gilje 
explored the perception of space and time through 
light projection with his exhibit in transit. In his 
statement about the project, Gilje wrote, “I try to 
engage in a sort of conversation with the spaces I 
work with, to be able to transform an existing space 
or object using image, light, sound, and motion.”
He added, “Being able to control what is visible 
and when it is visible gives me the opportunity to 
in?uence both the perception of time and space.”
Down the street at Space Gallery was an exhibit 
titled Out of Rubble, which featured work from 16 
international artists, including Wafaa Bilal, who gave 
a lecture at Carnegie Mellon last Tuesday. According 
to the gallery guide, the exhibit was focused on “the 
consequences of war, moving from decimation and 
disintegration to the possibilities of regeneration 
and recovery.” A combination of photography and 
mixed media pieces, the exhibit was politically 
charged and seemed to be a favorite among the 
younger crowd. 
Horne lauded the Gallery Crawl’s knack for 
presenting diverse work and the quality of the 
overall arts scene in Pittsburgh. “I think it’s really 
healthy when you can mix them up — create 
conceptual and visual buzz — and when the work 
[at different galleries] is different from each other 
and different from the previous shows.”
He added, “Cities like New York and L.A. have 
a really large private gallery scene that we can’t 
compete with. However, in the nonpro?ts, I think we 
can compete with anyone in the country, really. The 
quality of the work that’s shown in Pittsburgh is just 
outstanding.”

a Thistle and spend two or three 
evenings showing it to her.” Because 
the best way to get your girl “in the 
mood” is by showing her pictures of 
your classmates.

The pre-payment period opens for 
students to drop off a tuition check 
early for the next semester and avoid 
the cashier’s line. Imagine all 8,500 
students today lining up to pay for their 
tuition, then give a little prayer for the 
advent of online banking.

Our hockey team loses 6–5 to Edinboro 
after the opposition “capitalized on two

A SciTech brief states that the Food 
and Drug Administration would not 
impose success-rate standards on 
birth control medications found on the 
market. Because that’s the last thing 
people look for in the birth control they 
purchase.

A News article’s title reads “CulinArt 
pushes new green water options.” 
Really? Was that the best way to 
introduce a new health initiative? The 
first image in my head was something 
quite disgusting.
