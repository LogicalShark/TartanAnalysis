Glee Club 
To Schedule 
HS Concerts
The Men’s Glee Club has started 
off the year with several new de­
velopments. The first of these 
changes is a new director, Mr. 
Paul Brautigan, who is well- 
known around Pittsburgh as a 
choral director.
The second is the selection of 
student directors from the Glee 
Club. These directors are being 
selected by the members of the 
Glee Club and Mr. Brautigan. In 
addition, either a quartet or a 
double quartet is in the process of 
selection from the club.
Arrangements are in progress 
for several concerts. The club has 
already performed before the stu­
dents at the Carnegie Day exer­
cises, and a half-hour radio pro­
gram is being arranged for around 
Christmas time.
Concerts are being planned for 
students of Pittsburgh high 
schools, and a Christmas caroling 
tour around town has already 
been arranged.
The glee club opened its year 
with approximately 60 voices. Of­
ficers are: Raymond D. Good,
general manager; James G. Gilli­
land, assistant manager; Robert G. 
Hocker, secretary.
Ride A Bus
Delta Skull is sponsoring 
bus transportation to the 
Westminster game this Satur­
day. Reservations can be made 
with Ed Mitchell, SC. 1-9.888, 
or Bob Lynch* SC. 1-9846. All 
reservations must be made 
before midnight tonight. 
Round trip—$2.25 per person.
CFP, Pan-Hel Sends 
Kilties To Westminster
Officers of 3 Organized Classes 
Are Inaugurated By Student Council
The CIT band will receive transportation to the Westminster 
game according to an announcement made at last Wednesday’s 
Student Council meeting. Council members witnessed the formal in- | 
stallation of class officers as a concluding feature of the season.
* The band situation was handled 
through CFP and Pan-Hellenic 
Council. Each campus fraternity 
has been assessed a minimum 
donation of $10, and contributions 
will be made from the sororities 
by the individual members. Don 
Bickelman, who is in charge of 
the project, said the required cash 
would probably be raised in this 
way.
The issue was not taken before 
the entire student body in the 
form of a general solicitation of 
funds, because such action would 
have interfered with the Campus 
Chest campaign. Various Council 
members expressed the opinion 
that in the future participation in 
such projects should be made 
available to the entire school.
The meeting closed with the in­
auguration of officers of the three 
organized classes. This installation, 
the first such ceremony in Car­
negie history, was prepared by 
class organizations chairman Dolly 
Mitchell and executed by Council 
president, Art Christopher.
Vets To Notify 
V.A. Of Recall
GI Payments Cancelled 
For Active Servicemen
Veterans recalled to active mil­
itary duty while they are receiv­
ing benefit payments from the 
Veterans Administration can save 
themselves and the Government a 
lot of trouble by notifying VA im­
mediately of their recall.
These benefit payments include 
GI Bill or Public Law 16 sub­
sistence allowances and compen­
sation for service-connected disa­
bilities.
The law does not permit a vet­
eran to receive such VA payments 
once he goes back into uniform.
If a veteran receives such a 
payment covering any period after 
he has entered active duty, he 
should return it to the VA office 
which has his records, otherwise 
it will remain as an overpayment 
against him until disposed of.
The notification to VA of recall 
to active .duty should include the 
veteran’s “C” (claims) number, 
his complete name and address, 
the amount of the VA payment, 
what it’s for, and the date he is to 
go back into service.
John Burrey Serves 
Tech For 44% Years
By Ivan Sturman and Aline Kerr
Carnegie Tech still has on its campus a man who witnessed the 
first graduation exercises. He is purchasing agent John C. Burrey, 
who has proudly served Carnegie Tech 44% years, at present the 
longest service on campus. ?-----------------------------------------------------
Mr. Burrey can remember An­
drew Carnegie’s visits to the cam­
pus. He especially remembers the 
1914 visit. “He spoke to me, he 
spoke to everybody, and was very 
pleasant on this occasion.” The 
occasion was Carnegie’s visit to 
the newlj completed west wing of 
the Margaret Morrison Building.
Unique Assignment 
At that time a unique assign­
ment was given to Mr. Burrey. 
Automatic elevators, a recent de­
velopment, could not be depend­
ed upon. Because of his ability to 
repair the elevator in case it re­
fused to operate, Mr. Burrey was 
elevator boy for a day.
Fortunately the machine oper­
ated smoothly and the Founder 
was not delayed during his visit. 
Mr. Burrey expressed his deep 
respect for the founder. “His visit 
and every action indicated the 
spirit of democracy there was 
about the man.”
The cashiers office was Mr. 
Burreys first campus employment. 
Two of the ledgers that he kept 
now have historical significance. 
In one of them was entered each 
student’s $20 tuition and $5 
breakage fee. The names of the 
first class were arranged alpha­
betically and he recalls, ‘Norman 
Applegate was the first guy, it ended with a fellow by the name of Zitterraao.”
He kept the payroll ledger 
which was a record of every sal­
ary paid. Everyone including the 
janitors, instructors, and student 
help was paid through this ledger. 
Each person was required to sign 
his name beside the amount that 
he was paid.
Now Instructors 
Among the students signatures 
are those of an algebra instructor, 
Harry McKee who now is an as­
sistant professor in the Mechan­
ical Engineering Department. 
Frank Keck, was a messenger, is 
now superintendent of the power 
plant and power plant connections 
here at Tech. Charles E. Wilson, 
who once marked papers, is now 
the president of General Motors. 
This ledger is one of Mr. Bur­
reys proudest possessions.
Complicated Job 
The weekly payroll was a rath­
er complicated procedure. It was 
one of Mr. Burreys duties to com­
pute the total amount each week, 
have a check for the amount sign­
ed first by Director Hamerschlag, 
then by the secretary of the Board 
of Trustees, Mr. Scaife, then by 
Mr. Frew who was the president of 
th Board of Trustees, then by Miss 
Weir who was the assistant treas­
urer.
From there he went to the Mel-

1951 Script Selected 
By Scotch And Soda

Pash Trophy 
Award To Be 
Made Dec. 2
Cup To Be Presented 
To Winner At ROTC 
Military Ball in Gym
For the ffth consecutive year 
the Joe Pash memorial trophy will 
be awarded to Carnegie’s out­
standing football player of the 
year.
Joe Pash was a former CIT 
gridiron star, a little guy, weighing 
less than 155 pounds. He was a 
Phi Kap who graduated in Me­
chanical Engineering in Dec. 1942 
and entered active duty with the 
navy in Feb. 1943.
Lost In War
Attaining the rank of lieutenant, 
Joe was assigned to duty aboard 
the submarine Legarta. Shortly 
afterwards in “Operation South 
Pacific,” he and all his shipmates 
were reported missing in ac­
tion.
But to everyone who knew him, 
Joe Pash was something more—he 
was something big despite his 
meager 155 pounds. One of his 
former coaches, Walter Burns, 
called him one of the fastest men 
ever to play on the varsity foot­
ball squad. To his temmates, he 
was “a player’s player.” To every­
one he was as regular as they 
come.
17 Inch Cup
To perpetuate his memory his 
fraternity orothers inaugurated 
the Joe Pash memorial trophy, 
Maintained by Phi Kappa, the 17 
inch trophy is inscribed each year 
with the name of the player who 
was voted most outstanding by the 
football coaching staff and his 
teammates. There are four names 
on the trophy at present: Nick 
Simcic in 1948 and 1949. C. B. 
Groomes in 1947, and Ben Baklarz 
in 1946. The recipient of the 
award each year is presented with 
a miniature of the trophy.
This year’s balloting will occur 
after the final game. The winner’s 
name will be announcuo at the 
Military Ball on Dec. 2.
The script selected was written 
by Bob Larimer and Fred Price, 
who will be remembered as the 
authors of last year’s show, “Too 
Much.” Both Larimer and Price 
are seniors in • the Engineering 
School and have been connected 
with Scotch ’n Soda since their 
freshman year.
Fitting Title 
This year’s show has been 
titled, “Light Fantastique.” It is 
a musical and basic revue type 
show. However, it will differ 
from the usual revue in that a 
sub-plot runs thru the whole show 
and generally unites the unrelated 
scenes.
The setting for the show will 
be the Carnegie Tech campus and 
surrounding Pittsburgh area. The 
story, however, does not relate en­
tirely to college life.
New Home 
Big news for all concerned is 
the fact that the show will move 
off-campus. All that can be said 
is that the “new home” will not 
be the gym or the Music Hall, and 
that it has been used for and is 
especially adaptable to the presen­
tation of musical productions.
With the script and place set, 
Scotch ’n Soda is preparing for 
“cast calls.” Casting will take 
place on Saturday. December 9, 
and Sunday, December 10. Every­
one on campus is invited to try 
out. The Tartan will carry 
further information.

Editorials—
A Yearly Occurance
Every year we find that there is one week when we can 
take a welcome rest from distributing nosegays of onions 
to the various campus organizations and instead pin a large 
white orchid on the most diligent of the honoraries—Alpha 
Phi Omega, national scouting honorary. This year they 
have succeeded in publishing the “C” Book on the earliest 
date in recent years.
Beginning during the first week of school, the APO com- 
committee worked conscientiously at copyreading, checking and 
proof-reading (which required painstaking accuracy); they also 
assisted in the binding and selling of the book. The result is 
a non-profit, accurate guide to all Carnegie students at a date 
still early in the school year.
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the APO na­
tional organization and its 21 term on the Carnegie campus. 
Besides being the most active CIT honorary, the organiza­
tion performs many services for the Boy Scouts and allied 
groups—in fact, this is supposed to be its main function. 
But APO has taken the phrase ‘service to the school' to 
heart.
Even an abbreviated list of their projects is impressive. 
In addition to the “C” Book they have handled the dis­
tribution of robes at the Inauguration, conducted elections, 
and checked coats at the dances. They plan to handle the 
food concessions at Spring Carnival and to hold a Christmas 
party for orphans in late December.
So we would like to congratulate APO, as did President 
Warner in his letter of commendation on the “C” Book, “on 
a fine job and to thank the members of the Alpha Phi Omega 
committee for their good work which contributed so much 
to Carnegie.”
... In Glass Houses...
We’ve heard the hue and cry raised against the admin­
istration for its supposed reluctance in allowing a Monday 
morning pep rally following the victory over Case at Home­
coming. It’s time the facts were made known and the 
blame placed on the right doorstep.
On the Friday before the game, a meeting of the mem­
bers of the UAC, composed of students and faculty mem­
bers, was held to consider plans for a proposed rally on Mon­
day. It was suggested that the best method of determining 
student interest in such a rally was to have the student 
members of the committee phone their individual opinions 
to the Dean of Students on Sunday evening. The hope was 
that these students would be in a position to gauge student 
sentiment and would hear of any organized plans being 
formed by campus groups.
Almost to a man, these students informed the Dean of Stu­
dents that they had heard of no organized plans concerning 
Monday morning and that they thought a pep rally was un­
necessary. It was because of this that the school did not sanc­
tion a rally and we had the abortive demonstrations that we did.
Either UAC erred in assuming that its students mem- | 
bers would be able to form accurate opinions of the height 
of campus sentiment, or the students were handicapped by 
the lack of any leaders capable of organizing and controlling 
the rally—or perhaps both. But the administration, while 
it made the final decision, was not at fault. It was the stu­
dents themselves, and their representatives on the Under­
graduate Advisory Committee, who decided that there should 
be no pep rally.

Letter—
PetitionBlasted 
By Student 
Committee
Editor, the Tartan
Although the Homecoming 
weekend is a thing of the past, I 
should like to reply to the peti­
tion signed by the 500 students 
criticizing the choice of band for 
the Homecoming dance. The 
Homecoming committee feels that 
this petition was not valid, in that 
it was not based on any knowledge 
of the problems of the weekend, 
and did not solve any of the prob­
lems. Hence, we do not feel that 
it brought discredit upon the 
weekend, as planned by the com­
mittee.
The facts are these:
1. There was no place on cam­
pus to hold a student dance. The 
tie-up of space facilities by the 
Inauguration and 50th Anniver­
sary events, presented real ob­
stacles. The gym and Thistle Hall, 
which were being used for a 
luncheon on Saturday, could not 
have been cleared and decorated 
in time for the affair. To use the 
Inn, with an undetermined capac­
ity, meant having the floor tested 
to comply with safety regulations, 
which entailed a large expendi­
ture, and might not then have 
been suitable.
2. There was no assurance of 
student attendance at such an af­
fair because of the -day holi­
day declared.
Had we the assurance, before 
final plans were made, of the at­
tendance of the 500 petition sign­
ers plus the 280 couples who at­
tended the dance at the William 
Penn, we might have gone ahead 
with more elaborate plans. How­
ever, the Homecoming committee 
felt that it had no right to risk 
money which belonged to Student 
Council, on a dance which could 
not be predicted to succeed.
Simple mathematics show that 
in hiring a $2000 name band, to 
plan on a miximum of 500 couples 
(which would indeed be optimis­
tic), and charge $5.00 per couple, 
considering the other expenses in­
curred in the Homecoming week­
end, the margin is slim, and many 
would not have been willing to 
pay this.
How would the petition signers 
have solved their problems? I 
would advise, in the future, that 
such critics take their proposals to 
Student Council, where they are 
represented, and have an oppor­
tunity to accomplish their aims. 
Sincerely,
Ruby N. Weisberg 
Chairman,. 1950

MR. PRESIDENT . . . President 
Warner went to the Lehigh game 
to cheer his team to victory. Car­
negie indeed has a wonderful 
president.
PROMOTION . . . There is a 
fairly well-founded rumor on 
campus that when Dr. Dawes, his­
tory prof, was in Boston, he heard 
a Carnegie alumnus make a start­
ling announcement over a Boston 
radio network. He said that any 
high school football player inter­
ested in going to CIT should con­
tact him.
YOUR SLIP IS SHOWING . . . 
The Pitt News ran an article on 
Tech’s apology for the invasion of 
Pitt’s campus after the Case game. 
Both the president of Student 
Council, Art Christopher, and 
Dean Dickinson wrote letters of 
explanation and apology to Pitt. 
Quoting Dr. Dickinson, the Pitt 
article went on to say, “He was 
unhappy about the behavior of the 
students and hoped that such a 
thing would happen again. Typo­
graphical errors can prove mis­
leading at times and this was one 
of those times.
DE’ EARLY BOIDS . . . This 
year APO succeeded in publishing 
the Student Directory by October 
31, the earliest date on which the 
book has been published.
THE SMITH MYTH ... If you 
ever get a spare minute, don’t 
spend it counting the number of 
Smiths and Browns in the Student 
Directory. Here are the figures on 
this astounding bit of information. 
There are 25 Smiths, 10 Browns, 
and 10 Jones listed in the book.
FLANNEL PANEL . . . The 
pair of red flannels walking down 
Morewood on Hallowe’en night 
wasn’t an illusion; it was a Maggie 
Murph and her four friends out 
to “trick or treat” at the fraternity 
houses. The dorm girls got a 
rather wet reception at the Delta 
TaiL Delta house, however, and 
this dampened their Hallowe’en 
spirits.
TIME . . . Don’t miss getting a 
copy of the Time magazine of No­
vember 6. This issue features a 
well-written story on President 
Doherty. Here is another article 
that could be a CIT collector’s 
item.

Darling, and Charm.

44y2 Years of Service At Carnegie
iOle Swimmin9 Hole9 Recalled—
[Continued from page 1]
Ion Bank at 5th and Smithfield 
where he picked up a bundle 
wrapped in newspaper. This bun­
dle contained cash between 300 
and 1000 dollars. This system was 
used until 1909. During all this 
time Mr. Burrey wasn’t even 
bonded. He says the only protec­
tion he had was his ability to “run 
like a deer.” Mr. Burrey appreciat­
ed the way the school’s high of­
ficials treated him courteously 
and trusted him.
Chief Clerk 
In 1908 Mr. Burrey transferred 
to the position of chief clerk in 
Mr. Orbin’s office. At that time Mr, 
Orbin was purchasing agent, su­
perintendent of equipment and 
engineering assistant to the pres­
ident. After working with Mr.
Orbin for 14 years, Mr. Burrey 
was promoted to purchasing agent, 
which means he has bought every­
thing from pins to steam boilers 
for the school. During all his years 
of service Mr. Burrey has never 
had to ask or a raise in salary. 
Mr. Burrey says his employment 
has given him a “very fine chance 
to meet and understand people.” 
With a twinkle in his eye he 
recalls that during the very hot 
summer of 1921 he went swim­
ming with a group of people from 
the cashier’s office. He chuckled 
as he described the snappy bath­
ing suits of the day. Where did

Eight Carnegie Gridders End 
Careers In Westminster Game
Tartans Can Equal Record Of 1938 Team 
By Defeating Improved Titans On Saturday
Eight Tartan gridders will play their final game for Carnegie 
Tech next Saturday as the Skibos travel to New Wilmington, Pa., 
to close the 1950 gridiron season against an improved Westminster

Revenge!
With an opportunity to equal 
the best season record ever com­
piled by a Carnegie grid team 
and a tremendous desire to make­
up for the Lehigh disaster, the 
Plaid gridders will go all out to 
slaughter the Titans.
The 1938 Tartan football team 
rolled to the best season ever ex­
perienced at Skibo U., gaining 
seven wins against a single defeat 
A victory over Westminster would 
give the 1950 Tartans an identical 
record.
An impressive victory over 
Westminster might soften the Tar­
tan’s stunning loss to Lehigh. Car­
negie’s chances for a bowl bid 
have all but gone down the drain 
unless Dr. Baker and the Plaid 
can pull something big out their 
bag or tricks. Surely another de­
feat at • this point would end all 
possibility of a bowl bid.
May Be Rough
Although the Titans have won 
only one game this season, that a 
19-0 romp over Grove City, they 
have shown continued improve­
ment with each succeeding game. 
Last Saturday Westminster held 
Allegheny to a 14-14 tie at half- 
time before weakening in the 
fourth quarter to lose, thus indi­
cating that they are capable of 
giving the Plaid a tough afternoon.
SENIOR GRIDDERS
Pictured above are the eight senior members of the 1950 Car­
negie football team who will play their final game for the Plaid 
this Saturday at Westminster. Front row (1. to r.) are Augie Di- 
Giovanni, Jim Norton, Floyd Wiseman, and Lou Fougere; rear row 
(1. to r.) Tom Haney, Nick Simcic, Jack Magnifico, and Bob 
Dougherty.
Walker, Moore 
Elected Officers 
Of Tarquan Club
At a recent Tarquan meeting, 
Dee Walker was elected president; 
Elva Lee Moore, secretary; and Jo 
Ann Carmen, WAA board repre­
sentative. As a result of the ‘re­
cent tryouts, the club now has 45 
members. Eight fellows are work­
ing out regularly with the group 
and will be used in some of the 
water show routines.
Intramural volleyball is now 
under way every Wednesday at 
4:30 p.m. Anyone interested in 
participating is asked to meet in 
the women’s gym.
Gretchen Arnold was elected the 
archery club representative to the 
WAA board. '
IM Football Playoffs Slowed 
By Deadlock In Scottie League
The intramural touch football program came nearer to its con­
clusion during the past week despite poor weather.
The final standings in three of the leagues were definitely settled, 
and the standings in the fourth league required a three-way playoff.
A strong Theta Xi team man-* 
aged to complete their season 
without a single defeat in league 
competition to take the title in the 
Tartan League, while Emanon was 
the runner up. The Skibo League 
had Kappa Sigma emerging as its 
undefeated leader, while Tau Del­
ta Phi managed to gain the num­
ber two spot.
In the Kiltie League Delta Tau 
Delta and Alpha Tau Omega 
fought fought it out right down 
the line to capture the first and 
second spots respectively.
Three-Way Tie 
After considerable trouble from 
postponed games during the reg­
ular season, the Scottie League 
ended its regular play with a 
three-way tie for first place be­
tween Delta Upsilon, Sigma Nu 
‘B’, and Phi Kappa.
This three-way tie will have to 
be played off before the school 
championships can be completed.
Emanon Wins 
Thus far two of the champion­
ship playoff games have been 
played. In the first one, Tau Delta 
Phi and Theta Xi staged a see­
saw battle last Tuesday, with the
Tau Delts emerging as the victors 
by a 21-14 score.
In the second encounter, which 
proved to be one of the best games 
seen all season, Emanon and Delta 
Tau Delta took turns in holding 
the lead, Emanon finally emerg­
ing with the victory by a 25-17 
count.

Plaid Harriers Place 
Second In Tri-State
Douglas, Cooper Pace Skibo Attack 
Over Tough Slippery Rock Course
Carnegie Tech’s harriers climaxed a mediocre cross country 
season with an outstanding showing in the Tri State Track Associa­
tion Annual Cross Country Championship Run at Slippery Rock
¦?Saturday, November 11.
The Tartans finished second 
against teams which had previ­
ously beaten them in dual meets.Soccer Team 
Sets Record 
In First Win
Carnegie Tech’s oft-beaten soc­
cer team began to live up to its 
pre-season expectations last Fri­
day, defeating Allegheny College 
by a 5-1 margin. It marked the 
first win of the year for Coach 
Pat O’Connor’s proteges after a 
string of five straight losses.
Jack Burrey led the Plaid at­
tack on the muddy Forbes Street 
field, booting all fivf goals. Bur- 
rey’s feat sets a Carnegie record, 
being the first time any Tartan 
player has notched that number 
of scores in a single game. Hribar 
and Richards were also outstand­
ing, particularly on defense.
The Plaid booters close the sea­
son this week with away games 
with the Indiana Teachers today 
and Grove City Friday.
The competing teams included 
Westminster, Slippery Rock, Beth­
any, Geneva, and Carnegie Tech.
Westminster walked off with top 
team honors with 32 points. Car­
negie was second with 56 points, 
and Slippery Rock, Bethany, and 
Geneva followed in that order 
with 77, 87, and 112 points re­
spectively.
Ken Walker of Slippery Rock 
captured individual honors with 
a winning time of 23 minutes, 45 
seconds. Douglas, the first Car­
negie man to finish, was fourth in 
24:15. Cooper (7th) in 24:39, 
Bloom (13th) in 25:00, Carmen 
(14th) in 25:20, and Draper (18th) 
in 26.06 rounded out the Carnegie 
scoring.
These five were presented small 
medals for their individual accom­
plishments. The medals were 
miniature solid silver track shoes.
On the previous Saturday, No­
vember 4th, the Tartans dropped 
a home meet to the Tri State win­
ner, Westminster, 37-18.

Tartan Lineman Of The Week
For the third time the Tartan 
has selected Floyd Wiseman as the 
Lineman of the Week. Wiseman, 
left guard on offense and defen­
sive line-backer, played a spar­
kling defensive game, one of his 
best to date, though the Carnegie 
team went down to defeat against 
Lehigh.
It was Wiseman who shored the 
line up and shortened the gains 
of Lehigh’s powerful backfield unit 
when the going was tough. Floyd 
was in on practically every tackle 
as he held the line together against 
the faster, heavier Lehigh line.
Wiseman, who has played four 
seasons of varsity football for the 
Plaid, will be making his fare­
well appearance in a Tartan uni­
form against Westminster next 
Saturday and ean be counted on 
to turn in another outstanding 
performance.
Lehigh Engineers Too Strong; 
Hand Plaid First Season Defeat
The hopes of the Carnegie Tartans for their first undefeated grid 
season were rudely shattered Saturday as the Engineers of Lehigh 
turned what promised to be a close game into a 66-0 rout before 
12,000 fans at Taylor Stadium in Bethlehem.
For the Plaid team, possessors of*
Floyd Wiseman
Lineman Of The Week
the longest Carnegie victory streak 
since prewar, the defeat was hard 
to swallow as Lehigh marked up 
its most decisive win in 33 years 
and handed the Tartans one of 
their worst losses of all time. How­
ever, the Plaid can still equal the 
all-time Carnegie season record-if 
they defeat Westminster, Satur­
day.
Open Up
Lehigh began the scoring in the 
opening period on a lucky break 
as the Plaid, marking up three 
first downs to the Engineer’s one, 
had promised to give a hard 
fought game. With the ball on the
Plaid forty Simcic faded back to 
pass, but was hit by the Lehigh 
line breaking through and fum­
bled the ball. Ciaravino, Lehigh 
defensive guard, who was behind 
Simcic, caught the fumble in mid­
air and raced alone into the end 
zone to score.
In the second period Lehigh 
scored early on a sustained drive 
with Gabriel tallying the marker 
from the 7 yard line. With less 
than a minute remaining in the 
half and Tech on the Lehigh 37, a 
Holtz to Simcic pass was inter­
cepted by Lehigh and run back 43 
yards to the Carnegie 27. Doyne 
of Lehigh went through the line 
for 15, and then caught a Weiss 
pass in the end zone on the last 
play to make the halftime score 
20-0.
Lost Spirit
During the first quarter the 
Tartans had carried the game to 
Lehigh, but the first quarter TD 
plus the second quarter combina­
tion of two touchdowns, a fast, 
hard-charging Lehigh line, and a 
five man pass defense which 
smothered the Plaid offense, de­
moralized the team.
In the third and fourth periods
Fegley Winner 
Of November 4 
Football Contest
In what proved to be the most 
closely-contested “battle of the ex­
perts” so far this year, Frank Feg­
ley, freshman civil engineering 
student, has been named the win­
ner of the Tartan football contest 
covering games played on Novem­
ber 4.
Three contestants deadlocked by 
selecting nine of the ten games 
correctly and, for the first time, 
the winner had to be chosen on 
the basis of score differential. Feg­
ley proved best at predicting the 
margin of victory by which the 
teams would win.
Fegley’s one mistake came as a 
result of the Columbia upset win 
over Cornell, in which he picked 
the latter to win. Of the other two 
contestants that picked nine out 
of ten, one missed the Columbia 
victory and the other failed to 
call the Texas win over Southern 
Methodist.
the roof fell in, as nothing the 
Tartans tried worked right. Le­
high took advantage of the oppor­
tunities to roll up the score and 
reinforce their bid for a bowl 
game.
Wiseman, Fougere and Oberg 
stood out for the Tartans even in 
defeat as they played a clean,hard­
hitting game. Wiseman was es­
pecially brilliant in his defensive 
work.

INQUIRING REPORTER
Students Believe CIT 
Should Take Bowl Bid
Carnegie has a football team this year that deserves a break for 
the fine playing it has exhibited. What could be a better break than 
a bowl bid?
Of course, the first question to be settled is whether the CIT
team will be offered a bid to play*------------------------------------------ * 
in a class B bowl. There is a good 
chance the team will receive such 
a bid. Secondly, will Carnegie 
Tech accept such a bid?
Student polled by the inquiring 
reporter believe the school should 
accept a bid.
Lou Fugere. senior: “I think we 
should accept a bowl bid. As far as 
the players are concerned it is not 
such a good idea, because they
game, we can. 
scrimmage last
have to stay in 
training until 
News Years. I 
don’t think it is 
going commer­
cial to play in a 
bowl, and the 
team is good 
enough to play 
there. If St. 
Vincent can 
play a bowl 
We beat them in 
spring. The team 
would get a bid to a class B bowl 
like the Alligator, for instance. If 
we lost to Lehigh and won the oth­
er seven games, we'd have a 50- 
50 chance of getting a bid. But if 
we win at Lehigh. I don’t see how 
we can miss.”
Nancy Metcalf, junior: “We
should accept a bowl bid, because 
it is the first time in many years 
we’ve had any­
thing good as 
far as a foot- 
b a 11 team is 
concerned. This 
i» the first year 
that Tech has 
displayed good 
spirit. A bowl 
game would in- 
crease spirit 
and interest in 
football. It would make the com­
munity aware that we are playing
good ball. The fellows who have 
played deserve to play in a bowl; 
they deserve the recognition they 
would receive.”
Dick Duguid, senior: “Tech
should accept a bowl bid. The boys 
have got themselves a good team 
under the de­
emphasis pro- 
gram. Tech 
should take ad­
vantage of ev­
ery opportunity 
to publicize the 
school and show 
that it is possi­
ble to build a 
good team 
without em­
phasis if you stay in your class. I 
can’t think of any reason why it 
wouldn't be wise to accept a bid. 
Playing in a bowl might bring 
some good players here for next 
year’s squad.”
Aline Kerr, junior: “I definitely 
think we should take a bowl bid. 
It would be good publicity for
CIT and it ..........................
would help 
school spirit. I 
think the play­
ers would be 
willing to play.
Everyone would 
go to a game 
like that.”
Still, whether 
Carnegie Tech 
accepts a bid or 
not depends on: whether it gets a 
bid; whether the college’s policy 
makers decide in favor of accept­
ing one; whether the football 
team is willing to play such a 
game; whether the athletic fi­
nances can handle such a game.
In Lincoln, Nebraska, a favorite 
gathering spot of students at the 
University of Nebraska is Hermie’s 
“Inn” because it is a cheerful place 
—full of friendly university atmos­
phere. And when the gang gathers 
around, ice-cold Coca-Cola gets the 
call. For here, as in university 
haunts everywhere—Coke belongs.

the campus has been brought to a successful conclusion, and the con­
tributions from evening students were greatly appreciated.
The organizers of the Campus Chest realize that any 
contributions made by the evening students would be small at best, 
since practically all of the evening students had already contributed 
to the Community Chest drive held earlier in their respective com­
munities, and by their employers. The sum contributed by evening 
school was approximately $75.00, and when w7e consider that the 
men and women of evening school have many financial responsibili­
ties, this sum becomes great beyond its monetary value, for it proves 
that the evening students realize the necessity of helping the less 
unfortunate, and that they are willing to sacrifice a bit more when 
the occasion arises.
The resultant sum contributed this year by evening school was 
greater than it was last year, and although the drive was not as 
well organized as perhaps it could have been, it was, nevertheless 
a job wrell done by the evening school personnel who helped in 
the drive.
Although the drive was to be held Wednesday, Thursday, and 
Friday nights, Nov. 1 to Nov. 3, there was actually no soliciting 
done until Thursday night. This last minute change was not in­
tentional, but was due to the illness of one of the principal drive 
organizers.

BEFORE YOU SMOKE THEM
...you can tell Chesterfields will smoke milder, 
because tobaccos that smell milder smoke milder.
AFTER YOU SMOKE THEM
...you have no unpleasant after-taste.
WHILE YOU SMOKE THEM you get more pleasure than 
any other cigarette can give you — that's why millions of 
smokers say: THEY SATISFY.
