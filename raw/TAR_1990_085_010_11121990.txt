University 
considers 
free fifth 
year plan
By D. A. HENDERSON
Tartan Darkroom Manager
Carnegie Mellon University is considering a 
proposal developed by Student Government 
President Kishore Rao to give a select number 
of undergraduate scholars c. fifth year at CMU 
tuition-free.
“It is my understanding that the president is 
interested in looking at a program that would 
identify the very best students academically, 
and then, after they graduate from Carnegie 
Mellon, give them the opportunity to stay here 
for an extra year and do what they want to do for 
a year at no charge,” said Vice President for 
University Relations Don Hale.
The program, which is still in the development 
stages, would offer students who have completed 
a four or five year undergraduate degree the 
opportunity to stay for an extra year to study 
outside their major. Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy describes the general concept 
of the program as, “Outstanding students would 
be given an opportunity to study further during 
that year.”
The proposed program is loosely based on^ a 
University of Rochester program called Take 
Five. The Take Five program, developed foUT 
years ago, allows approximately twenty students 
a year to stay an extra year and study subjects 
which they could not study as undergraduates, 
University of Rochester Associate Provost Rutli 
Freeman says, “We have outlined a program to 
... significantly broaden the educational expe­
rience.”
“It is not an honors program,” says Freeman. 
“It is really about widening the breadth of 
education.”
At the University of Rochester, students are 
required to write a proposal before their junior 
year detailing the course of study they would

Higher fuel prices compel PAT rate increases
"The alternatives are almost nonexistent

Due to new increases ir diesel fuel 
flsts, Allegheny County’s Port Author- 
ty. Transit has announced a proposal to 
ncrease fare rates beginning January 1. 
f a rider stays within zone one, which 
ncludes the city, Oakland and Squirrel 
fill, the fare will be $1.25, up from 
&1.10.
“It bothers me because the rates also 
went up about two years ago, but I’ll 
have to live with it,” said senior IM major 
Walt Schearer, who uses PAT about once 
every two weeks.
Schearer said he might end up using 
his roommate’s car more often to avoid 
the higher rates.
“It probably won’t affect me, because I 
don’t use it that much, but I can see how 
it would affect people who take it every
day,” said sophomore professional/cre­
ative writing major Robert Dixon. “The 
raise is realistic, because you can see the 
gas prices going up everywhere else.”
Prior to the Persian Gulf Crisis, diesel 
fuel was 61 cents per gallon. When con­
structing the yearly budget PAT did not 
anticipate fuel costs higher than 72 cents
per gallon.
This week prices have lowered from 
$1.09 dollars per gallon, the record high, 
to just under one dollar. PAT estimates 
that every cent over 72 cents per gallon 
will cost an additional $100,000 a year; 
currently, there is a $3.2 million deficit: 
Roughly half of the PAT revenues come 
from local, state and federal subsidies. 
The other half comes from fares. Ac-

In an effort to encourage more students 
study abroad, Carnegie Mellon has 
iken over Stanford’s study abroad center 
Tours, France.
!This study abroad program, how to be 
¿led “Carnegie Mellon Centre de Tours,” 
however, only “one of a number of
President Mehrabian’s initiatives to ex­
pand international opportunities for 
students.”
The two committees on campus re­
sponsible for carrying out those initia­
tives are the International Awareness 
committee, which focuses on campus 
events to promote international under­
standing, and the Education Abroad 
Programs Committee, chaired by Modem
Languages Chair Barbara Freed, a pro­
fessor of French.
“The Education Abroad Committee’s 
goal is to have installed, by the fall of 
1991, additional options for education- 
abroad programs that CMU students 
from all schools on campus can partici­
pate in,” such as the upcoming program 
in France, said Freed.
According to Freed, the Education
Abroad Committee, which consists of 
faculty and staff representatives from 
each school, is designating an education 
abroad coordinator in each department— 
“someone whom students from that de­
partment can see to find out what the 
department has to offer in terms of 
studying abroad.”
The committee is also encouraging each 
department coordinator to work on “in­
creasing the flexibility of the 
department’s curriculum to accommo­
date students with a desire to study 
abroad,” so that students interested in 
studying abroad know they won’t have to 
“sacrifice time or courses” to do so.
According to Victor L. Thacker, direc­
tor of international education, Carnegie 
Mellon currently offers, besides the Tours

College Board reviews SATs
By RHONDA STRUMINGER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon administra­
tors are trying to assess what 
effect the recent changes in the 
SAT will have on CMU’s admis­
sion process.
The changes recently an­
nounced by the College Board aim 
to de-emphasize multipule choice 
and put more stress on reading 
comprehension.
Director of Admissions Mike 
Steidel is not yet sure how the 
changes will affect Carnegie 
Mellon. “The Planning Office,
which does the validity studies 
here, has some time to try to get a 
sense of of what the changes mean 
to CMU,” he said. “If the tests are 
doing what they are designed to 
do, they will be more closely pre­
dictive of student’s abilities.”
“The type of testing is chang­
ing,” said Vice President for En­
rollment William F. Elliott, a four- 
year trustee member of the Col­
lege Board, voted on the new 
proposal. “The test’s philosophy 
is that if the world unfortunately 
follows the lead of the test indus­
try, than the high schools will 
turn to multiple choice. We would 
like to emphasize critical think­
ing as it relates to reading pas­
sages and actual math calcula­
tions. We want to incorporate 
these things into the test so that 
general education will deem this

Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael 
Murphy and other 
University officials TARTAN
are giving new NEWS
thought to the ANALYSIS
problem of funding 
for club sports.
“We’re trying to see whether or 
not we can do a program that can be 
funded,” said Vice President for 
Enrollment William F. Elliott.
Murphy says that the situation of 
club sport funding has been anissue 
for a while, and that the growing 
popularity of club sports has 
prompted the University to explore 
some alternatives to the traditional 
funding sources. He explained that 
club sports fall somewhere between 
being student organizations and 
being athletic teams.
Presently, Student Senate pro­
vides most of the funding for club 
! sport budgets from the Activities 
'Fee. The rest comes from fund-rais- 
ing, donations, or students’ pockets. 
According to Senate Funding and 
; Recognition Committee Chair 
Satería Venable, “This is a huge 
burden on Student Senate. Without 
'financial support from the Univer­
sity we won’t be able to function for 
_ the spring semester.”
Women’s Lacrosse Captain Inge 
Swenson said, “If the administra- 
’ tion wants well-rounded students, 
v non-academic organizations are a

great way to do it. Unfortunately, like 
most improvements, they cost money.”
Venable said that appealing to the 
University is a last resort, but “some­
thing has got to be done.” For ex­
ample, Senate cannot afford the crew 
team even half the funds it needs.
Shawn Ohler, president of the Uni­
versity Rowing Club, said that crew 
runs a full time fund-raising program 
which includes constant selling of dif­
ferent items, working around cam­
pus, and sending letters out to par­
ents and alumni to cover its budget, 
which is “large, compared to a lot of 
clubs.”
“We are trying to run a varsity-l^vel 
program that can compete with pro­
grams that often get a lot more money 
than we db,” he said. “It’s wearing 
people down to practice every day, 
then fund-raise and work as well.”
Mike Petrich, a member of the 
Baseball Club, said the team’s big­
gest concern is its coach’s salary. 
While Senate funded this expendi­
ture in the past, it did not this year; 
therefore, team members had to do 
extensive fund-raising.
Murphy says he is gathering infor­
mation concerning the cost of each 
sport and the nature of the present 
funding to “see what gap exists.”

THIS JUST INMl
Noriega lawyers attempt to end drug trial over tapes
MIAMI (DJ) — An attorney for ousted 
Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega said 
he would seek to have all charges against 
J^Ioriega dismissed because privileged 
phone conversations between lawyer and 
client were taped by the government.
“In a case of this magnitude, it appears 
the government will stoop to any depth 
to win the case” said Frank Rubino, 
Noriega’s lead counsel.
In Washington, Robert S. Mueller, as- 
. .sistant attorney general of the Criminal 
Division, responded in a prepared state­
ment that “public reports that the gov­
ernment has improperly taped telephone
calls between Noriega and his counsel 
are false.”
The controversy arose early last 
Thursday, when Cable News Network 
broadcast a story which aired parts of 
taped conversations between Noriega and 
others. Acting on Rubino’s request, fed­
eral Judge William Hoeveler issued a 
temporary restraining order barring 
CNN from broadcasting the tapes.
But CNN, saying the judge’s order was 
an unconstitutional prior restraint, con­
tinued to broadcast through the day. 
Thursday night, the judge extended the 
temporary restraining order through
Friday. He also ordered the government 
to produce the full reel of its prison tapes, 
so that a magistrate could determine 
whether they compromise the defense 
case.
Rubino said the charges should be dis­
missed because the government’s taping 
violated the attorney-client privilege, 
which guarantees under most circum­
stances that prosecutors cannot inquire 
into the substance of conversations be­
tween lawyer and client.
But Mueller said the tapes were legal 
if they were the product of routine tele­
phone monitoring by the Bureau of
Prisons, which tapes conversations as a 
security measure. “Such monitoring is 
permitted by law,” his statement said. 
Noriega, like all prisoners, had signed 
an acknowledgement of monitoring — 
and his telephone had a notice that calls 
made on it are monitored, the statement 
said.
However, defense lawyers said prison 
authorities have the obligation to stop 
monitoring such conversations, as soon 
as they realize that the inmate is speak­
ing with his attorney.
Mueller noted that the Justice Depart­
ment can’t be sure whether the tapes
came from the Bureau of Prisons and 
investigating the matter.
CNN, a unit of Turner Broadcastiiv 
System Inc., said the tapes shovft 
Noriega trying to rebuild his bases' 
support in Panama and intending" 
implicate the Central Intelligence Agent 
as part of his defense. Legal experts, \vj 
had few details of the tape incident, sai 
they believed the tapes would have lifi 
impact on the outcome of the case. Th 
former Panamanian defense chief ft 
been awaiting trial since his surrericli 
to a U.S. invasion force last Decemb^j
Court allows Playboy Channel
WASHINGTON (AP) — The 
Supreme Court refused to let 
Puerto Rico prosecute some cable 
TV systems for carrying The 
Playboy Channel, rejecting argu­
ments that a lower court ruling 
unduly hampered states’ anti-ob- 
^Scenity efforts.
The justices, without comment, 
LMet stand rulings that such pros­
ecutions are pre-empted by fed­
eral law.
? In another obscenity case, the 
court upheld an Illinois law that 
lets authorities seize the prop­
erty of businesses convicted at 
least twice of obscenity violations.
* The court rejected the argument 
of Sequoia Books, Incorporated 
that the law operates as a prior 
restraint on free expression. At 
issue in the Puerto Rico case was 
the effect of the Cable Communi­
cations Policy Act of 1984, which 
imposes mandatory access obli­
gations on cable operators whose 
systems have at least 36 active 
channels.
The law says such operators 
must make available, on a first- 
come, first-serve basis, a certain 
number of channels for commer­
cial use by programmers not af­
filiated with the cable system.
Once an unaffiliated program­
mer obtains access, the cable op­
erator is prohibited from exercis­
ing any editorial control over the 
programming transmitted on that 
channel.
The federal law also states that 
cable operators cannot be held 
accountable for any libel, obscen­
ity, or false advertising carried on 
a channel that it surrendered un­
der the mandatory access provi­
sions.
In the spring of1987, a prosecu­
tor in Puerto Rico’s Department 
of Justice notified cable operators 
that criminal obscenity charges 
would be filed against all systems 
transmitting The Playboy Chan­
nel.
Within a few months, all cable 
systems but one, Teleponce Inc.,
had dropped The Playboy Chan­
nel, whichfeatures so-called adult 
entertainment.
Playboy Enterprises Inc., which 
through a wholly owned subsid­
iary distributed The Playboy 
Channel, and the Puerto Rico 
Cable Television Association, a 
trade group, then sUed Puerto 
Rico’s Department of Justice.
The suit, invoking a federal civil 
rights law, accused Puerto Rico 
officials of unlawfully interfering 
with free-speech rights.
U.S. District Judge Jaime 
Pieras Jr. barred authorities from 
taking any action against any 
cable operator carrying The 
Playboy Channel under the fed­
eral Cable Act’s mandatory access 
provisions.
The judge said local obscenity 
prosecutions of such cable opera­
tors were precluded by the federal 
law.
The Boston-based First U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld 
that ruling last June.
Gorbachev, Kohl sign treaty
BONN (DJ) — Soviet Presi­
dent Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
signed an historic non-aggres- 
sion treaty with German Chan­
cellor Helmut Kohl Friday and 
got a hero’s welcome for letting 
the Berlin Wall and Iron Cur­
tain collapse.
Gorbachev’s first visit to 
united Germany coincides with 
the first anniversary of the 
opening of the Berlin Wall, an 
appropriate touch of symbolism 
because his reforms helped 
make it happen.
Gorbachev and Kohl both 
stressed the importance of the 
historical changes that have 
made closer ties possible as they 
signed the broad agreement that 
is to serve as the foundation of
future relations.
In the treaty, initialed in Mos­
cow on September 13, both na­
tions make a pledge not to attack 
each other and to honor the bor­
ders of all other European na­
tions.
“We are closing the book on the 
painful past and clearing the way 
for a new beginning,” Kohl said 
in a speech at the ceremony.
Gorbachev arrived at Cologne- 
Bonn airport and was met by a 
27-man German military honor 
guard.
He was greeted by German 
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher.
Later in the morning, Gorba­
chev was greeted by President 
Richard von Wsizsaecker at the
government’s Villa Hammer- 
schmidt palace next to tl%§ 
Rhine River.
Gorbachev and his wife Raisa 
stopped to chat with a large! 
crowd of people waiting for him 
outside the palace before en­
tering.
Mrs. Gorbachev later visitel 
the picturesque city of Linz on 
the Rhine River with Kohl's 
wife, Hannelore.
The 20-year long non- 
sion treaty that Kohl and 
Gorbachev signed aims to as­
sist Gorbachev’s financially» 
strapped nation. Details on the 
magnitude of future German 
aid were expected to dominate 
the behind-the-scenes talks that 
the two had last week.
U.S. fires on Sudanese ship
EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA 
'¦{AP) — Warships of the U.S.-led 
multinational armada in the Gulf 
region fired warning shots three 
times across the bows of a 
Sudanese-flagged cargo ship be­
fore it stopped and was boarded, 
the U.S. Navy reported last week.
¦ • Navy spokesman Cmdr J.D. van 
Sickle said the freighter, the 
Umdurmaiiy refused repeated 
challenges after it was intercepted 
in the northern Red Sea en route 
to Aqaba, Jordan.
Aqaba has been used to tranship 
goods to Iraq to beat a United
Nations-imposed embargo 
against Iraq following its inva­
sion of Kuwait.
The Sudanese freighter 
Umdurmaii was initially inter­
cepted at about 12:35 am EST. 
The warship, whose name and 
nationality were not disclosed, 
fired warning shots across the 
Umdurman’s bow when it refused 
to stop.
A short time later, the guided- 
missile cruiser USS Philippine 
Sea and a third warship, whose 
name and nationality were also 
not immediately disclosed, ar­
rived.
The U.S. warship fired a 50- 
round burst from its 0.50-caliber 
machine gun when the vessel re­
fused to stop at 1:45 am EST, van 
Sickle said.
Ten minutes later, the Philip­
pine Sea fired another 50-round 
machine gun burst as well as two 
rounds from its 5-inch guns, the 
spokesman added.
A helicopter-borne boarding 
team searched the vessel, but no 
contraband was found and the 
Umdurman was allowed to pro­
ceed to Aqaba, van Sickle added.
WASHINGTON (DJ) — Presi­
dent Bush last week signed a bill 
granting most-favored-nation 
(MFN) tariff treatment to 
Czechoslovakia, allowing that 
nation to become the first East­
ern European nation to receive 
the special status for its exports 
to the U.S. since the revolutions 
of 1989.
Bush signed the bill in advance 
of his trip to Eastern Europe, in­
cluding a visit to Prague, next 
week.
“These sharply lower tariffs will 
provide the impetus for greatly 
expanded trade between the U.S. 
and Czechoslovakia and the first 
step toward a normalization of 
our bilateral trade relations,” 
Bush said.
In addition to extending MFN
“[This is] the first step toward a nor­
malization of our bilateral trade rela­
tions.” ;

tariff treatment, the trade agree­
ment contains important guar­
antees for U.S. businesses en­
gaging in trade with Czechoslo­
vakia. These include the right to 
nondiscrimination in renting of­
fice space, in paying for local 
goods, and in establishing bank 
accounts. Any hard currency 
earnings from trade may be re­
patriated immediately.
Czechoslovakia has also com­
mitted to upgrade significantly
its protection of intellects 
property rights, bringing its in 
tellectual property regime to 
level on a par with that of otto 
industrialized nations.

College Board re-works 
scholastic aptitude tests
SAT, from page 1
II Achievement Test that requires the use 
Jfa calculator. During 1992-93 a listening 
component for certain foreign language 
^sts will also be added.
The SAT-II writing tests will combine 
tjie all-multiple choice English Achieve­
ment Tests (Tests of Standard Written 
English) and the English Composition Test, 
previously only offered once a year in De­
cember. As a result, the English Composi­
tion Test, traditionally not required by 
iarnegie Mellon, will be offered five times 
a year, whenever the tests are offered.
1 “The reason Carnegie Mellon never re­
quired the English Composition Test be- 
ore was because it was only offered once a 
Taar. Since the test will now be offered 
numerous times a year, I do not see any 
reason why the test should not be required, 
especially in a place where writing is so 
important,” said Elliott.
The new SAT-I will have fewer multiple 
choice questions as well as fewer questions 
over all, but will focus more on testing 
students’ reasoning abilities. Twenty per­
cent of the questions will be in the new 
'grid-in” question format and the rest will 
“consist of established problem-solving 
Questions in five-choice and quantitative- 
¿bmparison formats,” according to the
booklet released by the College Board on the 
changes.
The math portion of SAT-I will now allow 
for the use of calculators, though they will not 
be required.
“The tests are to determine the student’s 
ability to do the work. I don’t think it is going 
to be a significant advantage or disadvantage 
for the kids from economically disadvantaged 
families,” said Elliott.
The College Board and the Educational 
Testing Service (ETS) have also been focus­
ing their attention on other changes. In the 
booklet released by the College Board, the 
attempt has been to “make the program more 
useful to students, schools, and colleges... An 
absolute commitment to guaranteeing fair­
ness and equity of the SAT has been a guiding 
principle to all explorations.”
College Board President Donald M. Stewart 
has said that the tests do not bias towards 
minorities and women.
“The SAT has been in continual evolution. 
It has never been set in concrete,” he said.
The policy at Carnegie Mellon, as explained 
to applicants, states that “the test scores are 
one small part of a very thorough process.... 
The scores allow us to make a better informed 
decision when used with other information. 
The SAT is never used as the sole factor in 
admitting students.”

PAT hikes 1 
bus fares |
FARE, from page 1
cording to Debra DeCourcy, assistant manager of 
media relations, “there is no reserve to tap into.”
“We are a system dependent upon the govern­
ment as well as riders. We don’t have a dedicated 
tax or a steady income. We make changes [in fares] 
based on cutbacks at the federal and state level,” 
said DeCourcy.
Should the Gulf Crisis subside soon, the need to 
raise fares will lessen. Chances are, however, that 
prices will still rise in order to account for the 
accumulated debt.
PAT is required by the state to have a balanced 
budget and “the alternatives are almost nonexist­
ent,” said DeCourcy.
Until January 1, the price change is still a 
proposal. PAT will reevaluate the proposal should 
fuel prices fall by then.
Bus fares are determined by the zone in which a 
rider travels. Zones are broken down into five 
areas. The first zone begins in downtown Pitts­
burgh and covers a radius of seven miles. The 
zones are concentric rings and each covers another 
seven mile radius.
Zone charges are planned to rise in proportion to 
the zone number, which represents the distance 
traveled from the city. Zone five, which extends 
outside Allegheny county, will see a fare increase 
of 50 cents. However, 80 percent of PAT bus riders 
stay within zone one.
Get your ID re-validated
r. All student, faculty and staff IDs must be re-encoded due to the 
recent theft of campus ID equipment. Throughout this week IDs 
will be processed in the Tartan Lounge, formerly the Tartan 
Brill.

toill be available: Monday, noon to 10 pm; Tuesday through 
Thursday, 7:30 am to 10 pm; Friday, 7:30 am to 1 pm.
- Everyone will be required to produce another form of identifica­
tion before their ID will be processed. New stickers will be placed 
on every re-encoded ID.
Anyone who is unable to have their ID reprocessed during the 
above times may do so by visiting the ID Office in Warner Hall 
beginning next Monday.
After Friday, old IDs will no longer operate in any retail, 
residence or dining facility.

Professors debate death 
penalty at CMU
Tomorrow, two local educators will be on the Carnegie Mellon 
campus to participate in a debate about the death penalty.
Professor Bruce Ledewitz, from the Duquesne University 
School of Law, and professor William Donohue, a sociology 
professor at LaRoche College — both seasoned debaters and 
experts on the delicate balance between ethics and public policy
— will be debating tomorrow night in Doherty Hall at 8 pm. The 
debate is open to the campus community.
The debate is sponsored by the Pennsylvania Association of 
Scholars.
Health department issues 
wildlife rabies warning
The Allegheny County Health Department has issued a rabies 
warning, telling residents to avoid contact with wildlife. The • 
warning was prompted by a report of a rabid raccoon in nearby 
Westmoreland County, the first animal diagnosed this year.
Wounds exposed to animal fluids should be cleansed immedi­
ately with soap and water and the victim should go to the near­
est hospital, or doctor, for treatment. The Health Department;, 
urges “wildlife should be captured and killed, if possible, and the 
body taken to the local health department for rabies testing.”
No animal rabies has been reported so far in Allegheny 
County. However, the disease could turn up here at any time due 
to the erratic and unpredictable nature of wildlife migration.

FIFTH YEAR, from page 1
¡take in four years and the course of study 
'they would take in five years. Then the 
^tudents write essays attempting to per­
suade Rochester to allow them to stay an 
¡extra year. For example, “a'mechanical 
engineering student who has been an 
amateur thespian can take courses in 
¡theatre,” explains Freeman.
The Carnegie Mellon program would 
ie an “academically driven operation,” 
iccording to Vice President for Enroll- 
nent William Elliott.
“The primary attribute of the student 
¡s academic performance and firepower,” 
says Elliott.
| Though the criteria for potential schol­
ars will not be set until the final pro-
University considers free fifth year proposal
posal, the main focus for selection will be 
academic, with some attention paid to 
leadership and extracurricular activi­
ties, according to Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy.
“We will haye to take a careful look at 
how you implement something like this,” 
said Hale.
President Mehrabian has proposed the 
program to the Academic Council, which 
is chaired by H&SS Dean Stephen 
Feinberg. Feinberg said that the Aca­
demic Council has asked the University 
Education Committee to do a more in 
depth proposal.
The UEC is in the process of selecting 
a committee to review the proposal and 
its alternatives. This committee will
“The primary attribute of the student is aca­
demic performance. ”
— William F. Elliott, 
vice president for enrollment
consist of two faculty members and 
Murphy, as well as a student who is yet 
to be selected. The committee will make 
its recommendations in the form of a 
written proposal.
The UEC committee will review the 
options in the early part of next semester 
and then present irs findings to the UEC 
“in three t© four months,” according to
Feinberg. The UEC will then present the 
proposal to the Academic Council.
Feinberg suggests that the University 
must evaluate its priorities and consider 
alternatives. “For example, why not al­
low a group of students to take a fifth 
year and go to Tours [France] and be free 
in their choice of classes,” he said.
The hopes for the program run high.
Hale explains, “[President Mehrabian] 
wants to use this as another opportunity 
to acknowledge outstanding students 
and to do something for undergraduate 
education. That’s really the goal of it.” 
“I think that, in time, this could be­
come a major recruiting asset,” saidRao 
“Secondly and more importantly, I think 
this group and the faculty that are in­
volved with the students can become C 
think tank to develop new and innova­
tive educational programs.
“In general, this university is clearly 
outstanding in developing new and inno­
vative research but in education it is 
somewhat less dynamic. This program 
can create that core group to help make 
education a focus.”

6The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 12 November 1990
University expands education abroad program
ABROAD, from page 1
prdgram to begin next fall, six 
!‘CMU-administered” study- 
abroad programs — one to the 
uEoele Polytechnique Federal de 
Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, 
another to Keio University in 
jJapan, and four other, smaller 
fc&Change programs begun just 
ttti's year by four individual de­
partments.
I In addition to an entire cata­
logue and database, available in 
Carnegie Mellon’s International 
Education Center, that direct 
students to over 2000 other pro­
grams worldwide, there are also 
about 1300 summer programs 
listed in the database.
! “There’s a tremendous variety 
of programs out there,” said 
Thacker.
1 According to Thacker, each of 
the six “CMU-administered” 
programs is “a tuition-exchange 
program, meaning that our stu­
dents pay Carnegie Mellon tuition 
here, which makes them eligible 
for their normal financial aid 
package.... All the credit received 
abroad transfers back and counts 
toward graduation.”
However, due to the added 
academic challenge of learning 
the foreign language, grades re­
ceived abroad are not recorded.
According to senior architect 
Becky Mingo, who studied last 
year at EPFL, students interested 
*in education abroad should not 
let the language barrier dissuade 
them from applying.
“It was a challenge to learn the 
language, but anybody at CMU 
can do it,” said Mingo. “If you saw 
someone in your class who couldn’t 
speak English really well, you’d 
help them out. Well, the students 
you meet abroad help you out, 
too.”
"Based on my personal experience, 
studying abroad is one of the most 
valuable experiences for an under­
graduate. "
— Barbara Freed, 
Modern Languages head
“My university puts an empha­
sis on language studies,” said 
Tomoko Tsuda, one of three study- 
abroad students at Carnegie 
Mellon from Japan’s Keio Uni­
versity, “ but it depends on the 
professors. Those who themselves 
have studied abroad encourage 
us to do the same. There’s not a lot 
of chance to speak informally with 
professors [at Keio] so we don’t 
always know what they think ... 
but Keio University is quite in­
ternational compared to some 
others.”
Currently, three Carnegie 
Mellon students are studying at 
Keio University, and six are at 
the EPFL in Switzerland.
“Based on my personal experi­
ence, studying abroad is one of 
the most valuable experiences for 
an undergraduate,” said Freed. 
Living in France as an under­
graduate “changed my life, my 
attitudes, what I choose to read, 
my friends, my interests in every 
aspect,” she said.
According to senior mechanical 
engineer Anthony Cheng, who 
studied at the EPFL last year, 
“it’s not too hard to get in” the 
CMU education abroad programs.
“In fact, we didn’t have enough” 
students going to Switzerland last 
year, said Cheng.
According to Thacker, “anyone
in good academic standing” is eli­
gible to study abroad.
“My goal,” said Thacker, “is to 
make [the CMU education-abroad 
programs] so popular that we will 
have heavy competition for them.”
Another goal, said Thacker, is 
to get freshmen thinking about 
studying • abroad during their 
sophomore year.
Some education-abroad pro­
grams, according to Thacker, also 
offer internships built in to the 
academic experience.
“Boston University and Butler 
University both have internships 
in London where if you’re an eco­
nomics major, they would ease up 
on the classroom time and let you 
go work with the London stock 
exchange,” said Thacker.
“One CMU student called Bos­
ton University and said ‘I like 
your program. I’d like to go to 
London and work for Estee 
Lauder,’ and they said, ‘Let us see 
if we can get you a position,’ and 
they did. So he spent the semes­
ter in London, getting his credits 
transferred back to Carnegie 
Mellon, and working for Estee 
Lauder. He told me that one day 
they just gave him a credit card 
and said ‘Go buy things from our 
competitors,’ so he spent the day 
just buying things.
“It was good introduction to an
element of business that is educa­
tion beyond the classroom,” said 
Thacker.
According to Thacker, 26 CMU 
students are studying abroad this 
year, and about one percent of the 
CMU student body studies abroad 
each year. Although the national 
average for other universities is 
still only two percent, it is the 
goal of both the Education Abroad 
Committee and of President 
Mehrabian to have ten percent of 
all Carnegie Mellon students 
studying abroad every year.
“The national organizations 
who have looked at the current 
study-abroad figures are worried 
about the U.S.’s ability to maneu­
ver in this new ‘small world,’ ” 
said Thacker, who cited an in­
stance in which an American stu­
dent professed to not knowing 
where Zaire is or even that Africa 
is not a country.
“It’s hard to be credible busi­
nessmen or diplomats or whatever 
we need to do in interacting with 
the rest of the world when we are 
just so ignorant of it,” said 
Thacker. “So one of the ways you 
get out of that is to mix with other 
people. And I think the reason 
that the International Awareness 
Committee has formed is the re­
alization that 90 percent of our 
students won’t be able to study 
abroad.”
Currently, approximately 825 
students — about 11 percent of 
Carnegie Mellon’s student body
— have come from other coun­
tries to study here. Of that figure, 
approximately 125 to 130 are un­
dergraduates, and 15 are one- 
year, foreign-study students. In 
addition to that 825, there are 
also around 250 “foreign schol­
ars,” who conduct research at 
Carnegie Mellon or who are oth­
erwise employed by the Univer­
sity for academic purposes.
“What we [the International 
Awareness Committee] are do­
ing,” said History Department 
Head Peter Stearns, who serves 
as the chair of that committee, “is 
trying to figure out ways to use 
the 800 international students 
that are here, not only to make 
their life more interesting and 
expressive while they are here, 
but also to relate their interests 
more to those of the American 
majority students who are 
around.”
One major International 
Awareness activity, an annual 
event to begin next fall, says 
Stearns, will be a fall festival 
“somewhat comparable in impact
to Spring Carnival.”
The festival is planned to in 
elude such things as plays, inter­
national foods, debates, and cul[ 
tural activities—“somethingthat 
will be entertaining, fun, and also 
educational,” said Stearns.
“And we’re eager for ideas,” 
Stearns. “If people have some ei 
citing new thoughts as to themes 
or activities... and it doesn’t havfc 
to be just this fall thing, becausfe 
we’re going to try to make 
reccommendations about how 
these activities can scattered 
throughout the year.
According to Thacker, it is not 
too late to apply to study abroad 
next September. The deadline % 
receiving applications is Novem­
ber 30.

FORUM
Rao plan widens a deep education
About five years ago, Carnegie 
Mellon’s recruiting slogan was 
¦ ‘The Professional Choice.”
Although the slogan’s been 
dropped, the image remains. Most 
students come to CMU because 
the level of intensive study in a 
particular field, be it engineering 
or art, is the education we’re 
looking for.
Talking about broadening our 
education is great—as long as we 
don’t have to sacrifice the depth 
that was the reason most of us 
picked CMU in the first place.
But still, many of us would like 
a broader education than our lim­
ited electives allow us. We’d like 
to take some of those non-major 
courses in CFA, or maybe pursue 
a sequence in philosophy or history 
or English literature. Some of us 
would like more time to study a 
foreign language, or even go 
abroad for a year; others would 
just love to study the mathemati­
cal foundations of logic.
With such a wealth of stimulat­
ing courses, wouldn’t it be great to 
get a free year here to take what­
ever you wanted?
Student Government President 
Kishore Rao is proposing that a 
select number of students be al­
lowed to stay here for a fifth year, 
after graduating, to broaden their 
education — for free.
Rao’s plan is one of the best 
ideas the administration has 
considered in a long time. How­
ever, the specifics of the proposal, 
we feel, could be improved.
The current fifth-year-free pro­
posal is one that is “academically 
driven,” according to Vice Presi­
dent for Enrollment Bill Elliott.
Each year, the top academic stu­
dents in each college, selected by 
QPA and coursework, would be 
invited to stay for an extra year 
with CMU footing the bill.
Unfortunately, the plan doesn’t 
seem like it would attract those 
budding intellectuals we think it 
should, because straight academic 
standing does not imply well­
roundedness. Instead, we’d point 
to the well-established program 
at the University of Rochester as 
the model to follow.
The Rochester program requires 
students to write a proposal ex­
plaining how they hope to benefit 
by a fifth year. Winners are se­
lected based on the impressiveness 
of their proposals combined with 
their past academic record.
Although the emphasis in the 
Rochester program is still on 
academics — where the CMU 
administration has correctly sug­
gested it belongs — the proposal- 
based approach opens the door for 
any student with a good idea to 
claim the award.
Furthermore, the proposal sys­
tem seems to direct the fifth-year 
scholarships to those students 
with the best ideas for putting 
them to use. Through their pro­
posals, the students themselves 
will tell the administration who 
will be most successful in meeting 
the program’s objectives — and 
therefore who is the most worthy 
of receiving it.
We don’t think the administra­
tion should stop with Rao’s pro­
posal when it looks at broadening 
Carnegie Mellon’s education. But 
it’s a good start — and a 21-year- 
old intellectual’s dream vacation.
We shouldn't start the fire in Gulf
Not all the world’s leaders have 
given up on diplomacy as a solu­
tion to the Persian Gulf crisis 
though it seems President Bush 
has.
Developments overthelastweek 
seem to indicate that the White 
House has turned to saber-rattling 
as its A-l strategy to tighten the 
screws on Iraq’s Saddam Hussein. 
Consider the following events:
•The U.S. has decided to send 
about 200,000 more troops to the 
Persian Gulf over the next two 
months, bringing the total Ameri­
can contingent there to 430,000. 
That’s virtually a man-to-man 
match between American and 
Iraqi troops in the region — and it 
gives the U.S. the capability to 
mount an offensive.
•The U.S., which currently 
chairstheUnitedNationsSecurity 
Council, is lobbying hard for a 
U.N. resolution that allows the 
use of force to oust Hussein from 
Kuwait. This week, the Soviet 
Union gave qualified approval to 
the plan — a key accomplishment 
for U.S. negotiators hoping to 
garner support for the resolution.
•The Bush administration, 
which originally claimed thatU.S. 
troops sent to Saudi Arabia would 
fight only to defend that country 
against further aggression from 
Iraq, has been mouthing more and 
more threatening rhetoric.
The administration is clearly 
adopting a more threatening 
stance toward Iraq. To the extent 
that a U.S. threat backed by some 
troop movements can cause 
Saddam Hussein to lose sleep at 
night — and potentially to leave
Kuwait without shots being fired 
— we favor the White House 
strategy.
However, don’t be fooled: We do 
not support a United States of­
fensive given the current situa­
tion. Words are great — but in 
this case, we want George Bush to 
keep our money the hell away 
from his mouth.
Simply put, we’re afraid of war.
Kuwait is not Panama or 
Grenada. U.S. aggression means 
thousands of U.S. deaths — to 
soldiers our age. George Bush’s 
friends won’t die in the desert. 
Ours will. That’s a high price, one 
we can’t get behind for something 
as silly as a dollar a gallon.
We’re not saying that the United 
States shouldn’t be in Saudi 
Arabia—that strategic move was 
necessary to insure that Iraq didn’t 
try and gobble up even more of the 
world’s oil reserves. Nor are we 
saying that our military shouldn’t 
defend itself and Saudi Arabia if 
Iraqi forces mount an offensive — 
the whole reason we’re there is to 
contain Iraq.
Nor are we ruling out the pos­
sibility of a U.S. attack in the 
future. We just want that possi­
bility restricted to the very di stant 
future — after we know the eco­
nomic blockade won’t work and 
after we’ve exhausted all other 
avenues of diplomacy.
Effectively, when the United 
States moved into Saudi Arabia 
in early August, we drew a line in 
the sand along the Saudi border. 
Let’s wait for Iraq to cross it.
It’s a simple message, George. 
Let the other guy start the fight.

ROTC monitors daily lives too closely
on
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
The discriminatory 
practices of ROTC 
provide sufficient rea­
son for removing it 
from campus, but 
there are many other reasons.
The most significant aspect of the 
ROTC discrimination policy is the fact 
that ROTC monitors the personal lives 
of students. One can be sure that it is not 
only the sexual orientation of the stu­
dents that concerns ROTC, but also any 
sign of non-conformity. ROTC students 
must fear that politically unpopular 
views will also be noted and affect their 
subsequent career.
Just as the military does not want 
sexual non-conformists, it clearly would 
not want left-wing radicals or those who
CARNEGIE MELLON
W 41
question such military actions as the 
U.S. attack on Panama in violation of 
international law. A recent article in 
Focus noted that ROTC members did not 
feel free to discuss the Persian Gulf cri­
sis.
The fundamental role of the university 
in a free society is to provide students an 
opportunity for learning and enquiry in
a free and open environment. The goal of 
ROTC is to train officers who will obey 
the orders of their commanders and the 
President. The so-called faculty of ROTC 
are selected by the Pentagon because 
they have demonstrated their ability to 
follow orders. The whole ROTC envi­
ronment is inconsistent with the role of 
the university.
Students have every right to join 
military organizations just as they may 
join other organizations that believe in 
discrimination. However, these organi­
zations should be strictly extracurricu­
lar. They should not be mixed into aca­
demic activities. It is time to move ROTC; 
off campus.

Editor:
I had to write this 
letter in response to 
the various comments 
that have literally 
scared me in some let­
ters written by CMU students. Michael 
T. Callihan [“Gay issues received too 
much coverage,” 10/29], a freshman in 
MCS, has proven to have all the symp­
toms of a classic homophobic. So, you say 
that gays receive too much coverage and 
the Carnegie Mellon business school 
ranking is really so much more important. 
Let’s be honest here! When you said you 
weren’t homophobic, were you not trying 
to convince yourself and others that you 
did not belong to such a diverse commu­
nity known for its gay-bashing?
Being a Hispanic, how many times can 
you guess I’ve heard “I’m not a racist?” 
To me, it’s still surprising that the “most” 
educated people still haven’t figured out 
Hispanics do not compose a race but an 
ethnic group. Don’t blame them. They’re 
still stunned that some of us know En­
glish!
Oh, by the way, I’m glad that you 
granted all of us minorities permission 
to be covered in The Tartan, as long as we 
don’t take up much space from that re­
ally important stuff!
Let’s examine something else. With 
your letter and another one, [“Not all 
white heterosexual males embrace the 
same beliefs,” 10/8] concerning white 
males being stereotyped as sexually in­
capable, it is obvious to me that there is 
some sort of a gay complex here. Where 
are the priorities set? Concerning thé
letter about white male sexual stereo­
types, I had to ask what importance does 
this have. If you guys, or boys, were 
stereotyped as sexual hurricanes in the 
sheets, what crusade would you be 
leading against racial stereotypes? Then, 
we have Mr. Callihan’s plea for that 
really important story about the CMU 
business school ranking! Why don’t you 
wake up in the real world for once? What 
is that CMU business school ranking 
going to do for us in the real world? If the 
gay community at CMU wants its voice 
to be heard, it should be given the right 
to do so. But I guess since you are an 
MCS student, you’re more concerned with 
facts and figures rather than getting an 
education in the real world.
You shouldn’t be worried, Mr. Callihan. 
The Tartan won’t probably give much 
space to minority groups on campus in 
the future. Yet, when one community 
speaks out, you’re afraid to hear it! La­
dies and gentleman, isn’t this a shame? 
It’s obvious the basic student’s priorities
are to present the problem and ignore w 
This is just like Tony DeRoss’ letter in 
the same Tartan [“Graffiti on windows 
needs a warning label,” 10/29]. Obviously 
the real world hasn’t visited MCS re­
cently. Mr. DeRoss doesn’t want to se 
profane language! Tell me, how’s lil 
been while not using swear words?J 
guess it scares you that these w 
come from women, since for you, freedog 
of speech is granted as long as you thin) 
it should! Anybody remember some fas­
cist dictators?
Sure, of course, you all have the ri 
to disagree with the gay community.^ 
exercise that particular right myself, but 
it doesn’t mean that I can limit what they 
say or control what they do. That’s their 
business! I personally don’t care what 
they do.
With this feedback, what are the 
chances that Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, 
etc. have in getting their view in The 
Tartan without the white campus frater-

I want to respond to 
the anonymous letter 
printed on November 
5, “Counseling Center 
found to be uncaring,” 
in which the writer reports that he or she 
did not actually make use of the Center, 
refers to it as “lax, uncaring, and unre­
sponsive,” and discourages the reader 
from visiting it.
By its very nature, the Counseling 
Center has no warranty; certainly some 
students come away feeling that the 
Center has merely wasted their time. 
But such was not my experience, which 
I offer so as perhaps to encourage some­
one in need of help to seek it.
I came here from the South in 1985 for 
graduate study. In late January 1986,
with the holidays behind and only snow, 
ice, and tests ahead, I felt worthless, 
isolated, and unhappy; a PhD seemed 
impossible! I realized that I was de­
pressed. Since relatives have suffered 
depression, I knew that it was important 
to seek help. Although I knew of the 
Counseling Center from advertisements 
in The Tartan and notices in other Uni­
versity literature, I was reluctant to seek 
help there; I contacted another organi­
zation, which upon learning that I was a 
student assured me that the University’s 
Center was most adequate, and told me 
to go there.
The CounselingCentertreatedme with 
dignity and very carefully protected my 
privacy. They first evaluated my condi­
tion, including a physical exam by a 
Student Health physician, before decid­
ing that they themselves might be 
help without referring me elsewhere. 
Through that winter, my counselor 
helped me see that I was neglecting son' 
important aspects of my life, and sr 
suggested some strategies for coping 
not all of them easy, but with work thejj 
helped.
Nearly five years later, I see that I 
married, leading a community organ'; 
zation apart from my studies, and eve 
happy sometimes. I don’t yet have tflj 
degree, but it is in sight. I credit t 'e 
Counseling Center with saving ®jj| 
graduate career. I come forward hop|j

Gripes about CMU lost 
their style long ago
Editor:
I’dliketotake 
this opportu­
nity to respond 
column 
written by
grendan McFeely last week 
¦CMU needs 24-hour services for 
itudents, 11/5].
Brendan, man, lighten up. Hat­
ing Carnegie Mellon went out of 
style a long time ago, my friend. 
You seemed to gripe about every 
single thing that you possibly 
,0uld, and I hate to break the 
lews to you, but it’s been done 
jefore.
Look, I am not trying to be ma- 
icious or anything, but in all seri- 
jusness, if you have a problem 
¿jth the way things are run on 
;his campus, stop writing about it 
ind do something about it. For 
od’s sake, all this campus needs 
another sedentary martyr. (By 
;he way, a lot of your problems

Get it?)
And if you want a solution to all 
your problems, I can answer all of 
your questions with one word: 
transfer. Believe me, it’s nothing 
new, it’s been done before, and 
rather successfully, I might add. 
But I can almost guarantee you, 
in your search for a better burger, 
you’ll discover that it’s very diffi­
cult to find a creative and pro­
fessional writing program com­
parable to the one at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Face it, we are at a pretty ter­
rific school. Let’s stop bashing 
Carnegie Mellon and start giving 
it the credit it deserves. And 
Brendan, I understand. Just 
about every freshman feels the 
same way you do, I know I did, 
and it gets better (at least it did 
for me). Just watch where you 
point that attitude of yours — 
you’ll poke someone’s eye out.

I’d like to conclude with my 
feelings concerning general 
homophobia. I don’t get what you 
boys are trying to prove by calling 
(gays or heterosexuals) “faggots.” 
How many times have I heard 
you boys brag about your penis 
size and make sexual references 
about the girl you hid the salami 
with?
Being a writer, I observe closely. 
And basically, you’re all full of

you do!
Steven Santos 
Freshman, H&SS
Unresearched methods placed blame with the wrong parties
Letter to 
the Editor
onbdtapg,
Usually, I don’t read 
nost of the columns that 
ppear in The Tartan, 
jut last week one in 
articular caught my 
ye. It was the column written by freshman 
rendan McFeely [“CMU needs 24-hour 
jrvices for students,” 11/5]. The reason I 
;alicized the word freshman is because! 
ealized he made many serious factual 
rrors in his column I feel were specifically 
ecause he has been at the University for 
>ss than a year.
The column addressed issues that come 
iplevery year. “Why is Carnegie Mellon 
to 24-hour campus?” Well, Brendan, if 
oil had done some research, you would
realize quite a few things. Or maybe if 
someone read your column before it was 
put in the paper, he or she could have 
corrected you.
I don’t have any problem with the spirit 
of your column, but I must say that it was 
a completely unprofessional piece of work, 
and completely unresearched. Rather than 
pointing out that most of the issues that 
you brought up have been brought up 
before and failed, not through burying by 
the university, but by apathy of the stu­
dents, I will just point out the factual 
errors in your column.
For the last couple of years Dining Ser­
vice has experimented with trying to have 
a 24-hour food service facility. Every time 
it has failed because of a lack of customers.
Health Services has increased its hours 
due to student pressure, it doesn’t close 
everyday at five, contrary to your accusa­
tion. The things that actually annoyed me 
most were the following statements you 
made:
“As long as there are work-study posi­
tions to be filled, there will be students 
filling them. Since the only requirement to 
keep a cluster operating is the CCon, why 
can’t they stay open twenty-four hours a 
day?”
Maybe you should think before you write, 
Brendan. Baker and Wean are open 24 
hours a day during normal school weeks. 
MMP and UCC are open 24 hours except 
Friday and Saturday nights when they 
close at midnight (and open at 10 am the
following day). CCons are not work-study 
students. Then you say:
“It seems to me that someone of admin­
istrative importance must read this paper, 
if only to delude him or herself into thinking 
that he or she is staying in touch with the 
student body.”
Well Brendan, I don’t see how you think 
by reading your column anyone could be 
kept “in touch” with the student body. 
Maybe you should have someone who knows 
something about the school read your col­
umns before you hand them in, consider­
ing that no one reads them before they are 
put in the paper.

'IS IT SAFE TO TURM IT BACK OM ASAIS?'Behold, world! Women come to the rescue!
Give it up, guys.
Your plot to take over the world 
isn't thickening. It is, in fact, a 
plan very much like a giant Swiss 
cheese — it’s full of holes.
But never fear — we women 
have come to fill up those gaps.
Just read last Wednesday’s 
edition of USA Today. One of the 
headlines on the front page states 
“Women vault to new high s at the 
polls,” and boy, were they right.
A nice win, in my opinion, was 
by Sharon Pratt Dixon for mayor 
of Washington D.C., succeeding 
Marion Barry. Not just anyone, 
mind you, could triumph the 
scandalous scumbag who got his 
kicks from purchasing (and later 
on using) cocaine in the streets of 
our nation’s capital. Geraldo 
Rivera wouldn’t have been able to 
defeat Barry. He’d end up spark­
ing up a war between tourists to 
the Smithsonian Museums and 
the mourners at the Vietnam Me­
morial, getting his tongue ripped 
out in the process.
No, it takes a very special kind 
of person to do these things. A 
person who has strength, deter­
mination, stamina, endurance, 
and several other redeeming 
qualities. The person must have 
once been oppressed and know
Susan Abrams
how to overcome this oppression. 
This person must understand 
what it is like to go through hour 
after hour of pain and torment 
(no, I am not referring to PMS or 
childbirth). This special person 
must stand up for what is right 
and help get rid of all the evil 
repressed souls in the world. This 
special person is a woman.
You don’tbelieve me? Let’s take 
a look back at our Greek mythol­
ogy. Imagine you have a problem 
with, say, how to separate the 
yolk from the egg white without 
making a mess in your mother’s 
kitchen so that she won’t yell at 
you for disgracing her pride and 
joy of a formica counter. Who 
would you go to? Minerva, the 
goddess of wisdom. She can also 
give a lot of other answers like the 
real reason why the sky is blue 
and how they get that big model 
ship into that tiny little bottle.
My point is, women have really 
known everything all along, but
men just would not let them show 
it. Deemed the weaker sex, women 
had to limit where they could 
uphold their talents, such as in 
the kitchen or with the laundry. 
But I have yet to see a certain 
lady I know prepare a good meal 
without burning anything or set­
ting off the fire alarm, thus in­
citing her dogs to bark forever, 
the noise of which can be heard 
over a radius of one mile.
Obviously, not all women are 
bom “weaker.” In fact, most of us 
were bom as bright, brave, posi­
tive-thinking, pleasant-minded, 
creative individuals who strive to 
succeed. Diane Feinstein, who 
almost became the new governor 
of California but lost to Senator 
Pete Wilson,, was shown in USA 
Today, undaunted by her defeat, 
smiling and holding a bumper 
sticker that read: “Some leaders 
are born women.”
And how right she is!
Even in the old days, When 
women were left at home while 
the men went out to earn money, 
they did quite a lot. So you think 
that cleaning a house is no big 
deal? Try cleaning up your room 
this very instant, dustballs and 
all. Did it take you all day? Two 
days, you say? Oh my. Wait a
minute, you mi ssed a spot there.... 
What’s that sticking out from 
under your bed? So that’s where 
you put all your junk, thinking I 
would fall for it.... Shame, shame.
One of my male friends always 
asks me to read his papers before 
he turns them in. I can’t under­
stand why he asks me over all the 
guys he lives with, but appar­
ently he trusts me more. How can 
itbe thathe doesn’t trusthis male 
friends as much as he trusts me: 
It’s because we women always gel. 
the job done, and we do a thor 
ough job at that.
Never mind the fact that I’m 
angry that not enough womer. 
have positions in politics to over­
ride the chances of people like 
Jesse Helm s retaining their seat: ¦> 
in Congress so we can get rid of 
old men who don’t do any good fo * 
us. I’m not being sexist or any­
thing. It’s just that I’ve noticed 
too many men who take the thing > 
we do for granted.
But not any more. The next few 
years are going to be filled with 
women everywhere. And our plan 
will work. Our plan will be gouds, 
not Swiss.

fudging by minority rather than individualism instigates discrimination
I’ve thought of a sure-fire way to elimi- 
late discrimination in this country. The 
asiest way to do it would be to stop 
eparatingus all into different minority 
roups.
All that minority groups do is divide us 
ito cliques based on the differences 
mong us all. If all we point out are our 
jifferences, then what else can we possi- 
jly expect but for people to resent one 
nother?
Just look at all the groups — Afro- 
Americans, homosexual-Americans, 
sian-Americans, feminist-Americans,
etc. — and how they’re hated by one or 
more elements of society. What we should 
concentrate on is the common thread 
that we all share; that we are Americans.
I come from a very mixed heritage — 
French, Italian, Irish, Russian, and many 
others — but I have never considered 
myself as belonging to any one particu­
lar ethnic group. I was bom in this country 
and I’m very proud of that. I am a native 
American, first and foremost. Everything 
else comes second. Anybody who was 
born here can claim that. Anybody who 
has become an adopted American can, as
The Archer's Quiver
Allan Bourdius
well.
Those who do not claim American 
citizenship should be entitled to the same 
recognition and rights as the rest of us 
because they are our guests. Nothing 
about a person should matter except the 
fact we are all part of the American
family, and therefore deserve the same 
opportunities and rights as all.
“I have a dream that one day men will 
be judged not by the color of their skin 
but by the content of their character.” 
When Martin Luther King spoke those 
famous words, he didn’t mean that we 
had to recognize each and every minority 
as its own community. Ke wanted us to 
all be judged as individual Americans — 
all equal by the very virtue of our citizen­
ship. If we take this ideal a little further, 
we are all human beings and citizens of 
the world and therefore we are ail en­
titled to the same privileges as the pe: - 
son next to us.
Identifying people with minority 
groups only increases the level of di: - 
crimination because it allows to peop! e 
to refer to others by such epithets as “he s 
black” or “she’s a lesbian.” If all we recoj 
nize of each other is our Americanisn ., 
then all anybody could say of each oth< r 
is, “He’s an American. I am too, and I’: a 
proud of it.”

Collegiate varsity athletics foul up
Right off the bat I want to con­
sulate the football Tartans on 
great season (which isn’t over 
et since they made the playoffs), 
haveto admit thatl do notfollow 
¡liege football very closely, but 
ised on the scores and what I 
we been told by people who do 
ay attention to the sport, it 
lunds like the team did an out- 
andingjob this year.
In fact, as far as I am concerned, 
ie Tartans should be serious 
ntenders for the national college 
otball championship, and not 
st in Division III.
It’s not that I think the Tartans 
iuld beat Notre Dame or any of 
je top Division I teams. I said 
fit I don’t follow college football 
osely. I didn’t say I just got in 
om Mars.
Clearly most of the top Division 
[earns would destroy the Tartans 
| the playing field, but so would 
of the teams in the NFL and, 
inestly, I don’t see a whole lot of 
fference between the two groups 
•cept that the NFL pays a little 
jtter.
With a few exceptions such as 
jeIvy League, Division I football 
lnd men’s basketball are dis­
hes to the colleges that par- 
jipate in them.
tni not talking about the in­
actions of the rules like ome 
hool paying an athlete a little 
, e than the going rate or ad­
ding some jock who’s even more 
ain dead than he’s allowed to

lemselves.

Believe it or not, there was a 
time when college athletics really 
were extracurricular activities for 
real students. One of my favorite 
trivia questions to ask people is 
what school produced the first 
Heisman Trophy winner for best 
college football player of the year. 
The answer is the University of 
Chicago (Jay Berwanger, 1935).
If I were the NCAA czar, college 
sports would.go back to being 
activities for real students as 
quickly as I could process the 
paperwork to boot the semi-pro 
underwater basket weaving ma­
jors and all the coaches, athletic 
directors, and college presidents 
who have been trying to pretend 
that these ringers have any 
business on a college campus.
Just like the drama club or the 
yearbook or any other extracur­
ricular activity, varsity athletics 
should be reserved for students 
who want to pursue their interests 
and talents outside the classroom 
during whatever free time they 
can manage to scrape up. It is 
shameful that schools are allowed 
to take this opportunity away from 
their students by bringing in 
professional athletes to fill their 
teams.
What is even more shameful is
that so many schools choose to 
exercise this opportunity.
I know that a lot of people will 
say that the top college football 
andmen’s basketball teams groom 
players for the pros and make a 
lot of money for the schools. Both 
of those things are true but hardly 
justifications for robbing students 
of extracurricular activities.
In the absence of the current 
system, the NFL and NBA would 
develop minor league systems like 
major league baseball and the 
NHL have done. As far as revenue 
for the schools goes, let them go 
back into the knowledge business 
instead of the sweat business and 
get some research grants.
Universities like those in the 
UAA and Ivy League seem to be 
doing fine without tons of sports 
money, so I suspect that Notre 
Dame and Pitt can do it too if they 
really have any academic merit 
hidden away behind their athletic 
programs (and they do).
That’s why I’m pushing the 
Tartans for first place in the na­
tional polls. The team managed 
to compile a great record using 
players who are first and foremost 
some of the top minds of their 
generation and only secondarily 
gifted athletes. That is the way 
college athletics should be.

SUP A master’s student and 1990 
biology department alumnus. If 
the NCAA is looking for a czar, he 
will be ready to start work on the 
first of June.

Finals season creates inconsistent thinking
Michael J. Ewedosh
It seems like the semester just 
started, but the number of class 
days left is already down to only
17 (counting today). Soon, finals 
will be upon us and we’ll be anx­
iously awaiting the day that we’re 
out of here and sleeping long and 
late somewhere else.
•Speaking of finals, I’m really 
wondering what the future holds 
for the tradition of the 250 soda 
pop. For those of you that haven’t 
yet experienced Carnegie Mellon 
finals, one of the more humane 
aspects of that week has tradi­
tionally been free refreshments 
and a reduction in the price of 
soda to 25^. The freebies and dis­
counts are subsidized by the 
Student Dormitory Council and 
the Housing Office. Marriott 
Vending’s decision to raise the 
price of soda to 600 a can this year 
may very well jeopardize that 
tradition if Housing and SDC 
would have to fork over 20 per­
cent more to make the program 
work when they did last year. You 
don’t suppose Marriott would cut 
Housing and SDC a break, do 
you?
•If you’re like me, picking out 
the right holiday gift is usually 
difficult. If you’re looking for 
something that is out of the ordi­
nary, you might try checking with 
Philadelphia Mayor Wilson 
Goode. Among the items that 
could be up for grabs among the 
most eccentric gift-givers are 
Veterans’ Stadium, the Philadel­
phia International Airport, the 
Water Department, the Philadel­
phia Gas Works, the Civic Cen­
ter, and a slew of city-owned 
parking garages. Goode plans a 
sale of assets that could include 
any of those items to evade an 
impending fiscal disaster. I won­
der if they’ll have gift boxes.
• A 34-year old tax attorney was 
arrested Friday morning when 
he got off of a plane in Los Ange­
les. At the request of the captain, 
airport police charged the attor­
ney with petty theft. If there was 
any pettiness involved with this 
incident, it was on the part of the 
airline involved, United Airlines.
“The Illinois Pet Cemetery in Hanover 
Park, Illinois, will pick up your ashes 
from any Chicago location and bury 
you next to your pet.... ”
The man wanted to watch the 
movie shown on the flight but did 
not want to pay the $4 fee to rent 
headphones to listen to the 
soundtrack. After all, he had his 
own set of headphones and de­
cided to use them despite a warn­
ing from the flight attendant. The 
friendly skies are not so friendly, 
are they?
• If you haven’t been able to rest 
comfortably knowing that, after 
you die, you’ll spend life after 
death far away from your beloved

Public financing of elections unseats incumbents
“Throw out the rascals! Throw 
' »ut the rascals!” This sentiment 
)f American voters was the ral­
lying cry of what most people 
hought was going to be the year 
i if the upsets. Come Election Day,
• hough, this chant had practically 
'anished along with all the voters 
' »ehind the movement.
“What happened?” most people 
vondered as they watched the
• lection coverage or read the final 
allies the next day. Surely the 
lumbers astonished most experts 
/ho had pegged the country as
• xtremely anti-incumbent, or 
/ere the analysts misreading the
; nood of the nation?
In the Senate, those who ran for 
e-electiori won in 97 percent of 
he races (only one incumbent out
• f 32 lost his seat). This is an 
: stonishing figure considering the 
. igh level of disgust with incum- 
I .ents this election year.
The House of Representatives 
1 ad a higher roll-over rate than 
I he Senate, with nine incumbents 
1 )sing their seats, but re-election 
l ates remain way too high to 
(onclude that all the rascals have 
1 een tossed out on their bums.
The largest turnover, however, 
was in the gubernatorial races 
i ationwide. Voters took their anti- 
i icumbent frustrations out on the 
1. iggest politician in their state 
i ather than those in the national 
£ overnment, with six out of 23 
i icumbents losing their seats.
T.S. Blass
How did members of Congress 
escape the chagrin of the voters?
Simply put, it was money. A few 
senators had a combined war 
chest of funds and contributions 
larger than all the challengers put 
together. Most politicians spend 
every single day going to fund­
raisers in order to raise the 
amounts of money needed to be 
re-elected time and time again. 
State and local politicians do not 
eve.n come close to matching the 
financing power of members of 
Congress. Private and special 
interest groups contribute so 
much to the campaigns of the 
men and women in Congress that 
it seems impossible that the 
members of Congress do not be­
come attached to these narrow 
interests.
The time has come for the public 
financing of Congressional cam­
paigns. Ideas of this sort have 
been proposed before now, b.ut 
they were soundly rejected as a 
disadvantage to incumbents. With 
public financing of political cam­
paigns, the playing field can be­
come level once again. In the 
process, special interest ties could 
be severed, lowering the financ­
ing powers of members of Con­
gress by a considerable amount. 
Politicians could finally come to­
gether and work to solve some of 
the more daunting problems fac­
ing America today rather than 
simply sending out mass mailings 
for their re-election at their con­
stituents’ expense. The national 
government has lost its ability to 
elect new faces to Congress but 
public financing could push the 
reform efforts to a pinnacle.
Why is public financing needed? 
Congressional races across the 
country have rapidly become 
spending contests. As I mentioned 
before, members of Congress 
spend a great deal of time raising 
the amounts of money needed to 
run a successful campaign. 
Challengers fight an uphill battle 
trying to defeat special interest 
money while receiving compara­
bly less than the incumbent. Once 
set free of obligations to special 
interest groups for money, in­
cumbents would be freer to act 
and legislate more conscien­
tiously.
The most important lesson 
Americans have learned as a re­
sult of the 1990 elections is that 
reform within our elected bodies 
is necessary for productivity. Year 
after year of the same system axid 
with the same politicians will soon 
produce such an aversion to both 
that the elected officials will be 
removed from office come the next 
election. In an effort to avoid 
having this happen to them, 
politicians should consider pub­
licly financing their elections so 
as to reform the old system of 
being financed by special interest 
groups.
Wouldn’t you rather have fair 
races that cost a few dollars than 
face a wall of incumbents on the 
ballot at every election?

Carnegie Mellon’s 
men’s basketball program 
will take on a new look 
this year under the di­
rection of new head coach 
Tony Wingen. Last year, 
under Larry Anderson the 
team compiled a 4-21 record—1-13 in the 
University Athletic Association [UAA].
The numbers on the scoreboard tell the 
whole story; the Tartans reached the 80- 
point mark only five times all season. Oppo­
nents, on the other hand, scored 90 or more
points in 11 games. The Tartans were 
outscored by an average of 15.1 points 
per game.
Wingen’s effect will be very notice­
able. He has already implemented an 
“entirely new system”' utilizing an “up­
tempo style of play.” The team will be 
relying on speed and the fast break, an 
offensive system foreign to previous 
Tartan teams.
Last season, the Tartans came out of 
the gate with six straight losses, in­
cluding three games in which the op­
position scored 100 points. The Tartans 
beat Haverford 83-79, then proceeded 
to rattle off five more losses.

The 1990-91 Carnegie Mellon women’s 
basketball team has a 
long road ahead of it this 
season. The team has to 
follow on the heels of a 
successful campaign last 
season, three of the 
team’s top players 
graduated, and the Tar­
tans play a perennially tough schedule.
However, Head Coach Gerri Seidl, en­
tering her seventh season as the Tartans’ 
coach, is optimistic about the upcoming 
season.
“We’re a totally different team,” she
said. “This year’s team is much more 
intense and more focused than any other 
I’ve coached here.”
The 1989-90 season was a successful 
one for Seidl and the Tartans. The team 
forged a 17—9 record which was high­
lighted by its second straight Presidents’ 
Athletic Conference championship. The 
Tartans compiled a 7-1 record in their 
last year as PAC members. In addition, 
Seidl was named PAC Coach of the Y ear.
The Tartans went 8-6 in the Univer­
sity Athletic Association, which was good 
for fourth place behind Washington 
University (14-0), the University of 
Chicago (11-3), and Johns Hopkins (5- 
3). New York University also finished

oops a chance
Carnegie Mellon’s basketball 
lam's begin their seasons this 
leek, but if history repeats 
self, as it usually does around 
ere, no one will bother to show 
p to support the teams.
After the sparse crowds for 
le highly successful football

occer game where the number 
dogs in the stands threatened 
outnumber the fans), I feel 
[most obligated to suggest that 
lembers of the campus commu-

I lhow the standard excuse 
ilniost a school tradition in

on’t have enough time. How 
in thousands of people not 
ave enough time to go to even 
ie basketball game? It brings 
p the question, “How can they 
¡1 not have time at exactly the 
me time?'
Others say they don’t have

[rge chunk of change that most

With its playoff hopes — and 
its undefeated season — on the 
line Saturday, the Tartan football 
team rose to the occasion, beating 
UAA rival Case Western Reserve 
University 42—17 at Finnigan 
Field in Cleveland.
The win boosted the Tartans’ 
regular season record to 10-0, 
and helped clinch both the inau­
gural University Athletic Asso­
ciation championship and, more . 
importantly, a spot in the playoffs.
“This is definitely a dream come 
true,” said senior quarterback Bill 
Snyder.
“We really felt that if we won 
today in a convincing manner, 
everything would work out and 
we would make the playoffs,” said 
offensive coordinator Rich 
Erdelyi. “All things considered, 
we deserve to be there. We have a 
good football team.”
Coming into Saturday’s game, 
the Tartans were ranked fifth in 
Division III South Region poles, 
but two of the top five teams in 
the region lost on Saturday. Top- 
ranked Ferrum lost to Dayton 42— 
22, and Frostburg State, the 
number three team, lost to 
Waynesburg, 28-18. That leaves 
just three undefeated teams in 
the South Region—CMU, Wash- 
ington & Jefferson, and Lycoming. 
The top four advance to post­
season play.
“We’ve worked hard for it and 
we deserve to go,” said junior de­
fensive back Jeff Palaima. “It felt 
great to make the playoffs out- 
and-out, and not have to rely on 
other teams losing.”
In this last regular season game, 
records were broken and mile­
stones reached, accomplishments 
overshadowed by an undefeated 
season and a playoff berth. The 
Tartans set the NCAA Division 
III record for most consecutive 
games without being shutout 
(174). The last time the Tartans 
were held scoreless was in the 
1972 season opener.
CMU also set school records for 
most points and most yards rush­
ing in a season. Their 42 points 
and 302 yards rushing gave the 
team 341 points and 2,979 yards, 
shattering the old marks of 300, 
set last season, and 2,678, set in

1977.
“I’d like to really hail the offen­
sive line,” said Snyder. “They 
knew that they had the support­
ing cast in the backfield, but if 
they don’t do the job up front, we 
don’t get the job done offensively.”
“We haven’t met a defense so 
far that we feel matches up to us 
when we get out on the field,” said 
offensive lineman Rich Wilson. 
“There wasn’t a point in time or 
game this season that we ever 
had a breakdown. We always gave
100 percent.”
Two Tartan seniors reached • 
milestones during Saturday’s 
game. Snyder, who earlier in the 
season set the Division III record 
for most consecutive completions 
in a game (17), needed just five 
yards to move into sixth place on 
the Tartans’ all-time passing list. 
Snyder finished the day seven-of- 
12 for 206 yards to end his career 
with 2,249 yards.
“The individual accomplish­
ments couldn’t have happened
without a total team effort,” said 
Snyder. “They happen because 
the team is worried about the 
whole team and not individuals.”
Halfback Scott Barnyak, who 
already set six school records this 
season, gained J 09 yards against 
Case to pass the 1,000-yard mark 
for the season. He also leads all 
Division III players in scoring, 
averaging 13.3 points per game.
“If I can be on top of the nation, 
it says a lot for the team,” said 
Barnyak. “I think the team should
get a lot of credit. I wouldn’t be 
there if the other ten guys on the 
field didn’t do their job.
The first half did not go exactly 
according to the Tartans’ plans. 
Case scored all of its 17 points 
during the first two quarters, 
piling up 284 yards total offense. 
Though the Tartans led 28-17 at 
the half, they didn’t look as sharp 
as they had in previous games.

our offense drive down and clob-

Approaching their last game of 
the regular season against Case 
Western Reserve, the Tartans 
faced the possibility that they 
could go 10-0 and still not make 
the playoffs.
But after an impressive 42—17
victory against Case on Saturday, 
combined with losses by Ferrum 
and Frostburg State, CMU 
clinched a playoff berth.
Before the weekend’s events, 
the Tartans were not secured for 
a playoff spot. “Our playoff hopes 
are alive,” said Head Coach Rich 
Lackner in an interview last week. 
“We’re not a lock to be in, but
we’re not a lock to be out either. 
It’s a situation where final voting 
will decide this Sunday (yester­
day).” Yesterday’s voting assured 
the Tartans of a spot in the play­
offs.
The NCAA chooses playoff 
teams in the following manner: 
The United States is divided into 
four sections in Division III foot-
ball — North, South, East, and 
West. Each section is permitted 
four teams to receive playoff 
births, for a total of sixteen teams 
in the first round. Those four 
teams are chosen by a committee 
in each region.
Before Saturday’s game, the 
Tartans were ranked fifth in the 
South. It is unusual at this time of
the year for an undefeated team 
to rank fifth. But the four teams 
ranked above the Tartans were 
also undefeated, so there was a 
possibility that the Tartans could 
go 10-0 and still not make the 
playoffs.
“This is a highly unusual situa­
tion,” said Lackner. “In all the

with a 8-6 record, but the Tartans had a 
better overall record.
The Tartans began 
the season with a six- 
game win streak lead­
ing into the winter 
break. The run in­
cluded live UAA wins, 
including a 60-57 overtime decision over 
New York University.
Unfortunately, the Tartans came back 
slowly after the break, losing four of their 
first five games. A pair of close wins 
against Emory and Grove City were fol­
lowed by the biggest challenge of the 
season, back-to-back games against 
Washington University and the Univer­
sity of Chicago.
Washington and Chicago were the top 
two teams in the UAA at the time, and 
the games represented a prime opportu­
nity for the Tartans. Unfortunately, the 
Tartans dropped both games and later 
lost the road rematches against both 
teams.
The Tartans managed to salvage the 
PAC championship amidst the UAA tur­
moil. CMU won consecutive PAC games 
against W&J, Thiel, and Bethany before 
the Chicago-St. Louis road trip, and beat 
the same teams in the final two weeks of 
the season to clinch the league title.
“Winning the PAC was a big thing,” 
said Seidl. “It’s really hard to get a back- 
to-back championship in any league.”
Graduation has left several holes in the 
Tartan lineup; forward Lisa Smith and 
guard Donna Spicuzza, the team’s num­
ber one and two scorers, departed along 
with center Tricia Chorgo. Smith was a 
first-team All-PAC selection and led the 
Tartans with 14.9 points per game; 
Spicuzza followed with 9.8 per game. 
Chorgo was second on the team in re­
bounds with 8.7 per game despite being 
hindered by a knee injury.
To fill that void, the Tartans add four 
freshmen to the roster this season. Trish
Henrich, Jeanine Megahan, and Mary 
Moore bolster the forward position, while 
Diane Jakubiak adds some depth at guard.
“Numbers-wise we’re down,” said Seidl, 
“but ability-wise, they’ll help us. People 
will be surprised; there’s a lot of new 
faces.”
Seidl is particularly pleased with 
Megahan. “Jeanine Megahan is definitely 
a player,” she said. “She’ll have an imme­
diate impact. She’s the first player since 
Lisa Lightner’s group in 1984-85 to come 
in and earn a starting spot.”
“I came from a good program where a lot 
of players went to Division I schools, so I’m 
used to the level of competition,” said 
Megahan. “I knew I’d get some playing 
time, but I didn’t expect to be starting. I’m 
very excited.”
Seidl is counting on juniors Katie Fahey, 
Amy Buxbaum, and Heather O’Donnell to 
lead the team this year. Fahey finished 
third in scoring last year (9.0 points per 
game) but will have to make the shift from 
forward to guard; Buxbaum was fourth in 
scoring (8.6 points per game) and led the 
Tartans in rebounding. O’Donnell scored 
6.4 points per game, and was second in 
assists (2.7 per game).
Sophomore Kelly Sterling and junior 
Bridget Eperthener will return to back up 
the guard position; sophomore Chandra 
Buist and senior Lynn Truskie augment 
the forward picture.
On the court, Seidl has decided to aban­
don the four-guard offense that was occa­
sionally used last season. “We won’t be 
using the four-guard offense any more,” 
she said. “We’re going to run with a three- 
guard offense with two forwards. We’ll 
also have a two-guard offense, but we’ll be 
focusing on the three-guard aspect.
“Defensively, we need to learn basic man- 
to-man defense,” she continued. “It’s our 
biggest weakness, and I’m going crazy 
over it. It’s a big part of our game, and 
we’re not doing it the way I envision it.” 
Defensive woes aside, Seidl is extremely 
pleased with the attitude of this year’s

team. “This year, the greatest part is that 
they play the game the way it was meant 
to be played,” she said. “They’re better 
students of the game; they look for the 
opportunity rather than looking for one 
person.
“They play more creatively and under­
stand the concepts. It’s more fun to watch 
and more fun for me to coach.”
“We’re starting to work prett> well to­

court is importamt; we don’t have one 
person that’s so outstanding that we work

Turning to the schedule, the level of com­
petition will be high this year, especially 
within the UAA. Chicago and Washington 
went to the tournament last season and 
return most of their players, but the UAA as 
a whole will be a challenge. But that’s the 
way the Tartans like it.
“We set our schedule to be tough,” said 
Seidl. “We want to play regionally ranked 
teams because we want to know where we 
stand.”
“It’s going to be very difficult,” said 
O’Donnell, “but it will be fun to see how well 
we can do.”

This season looks to be just as

Coach Wingen has nothing but 
praise for his two stars. “Phillip is 
a very explosive player and Chris 
is very solic^ defensively.”
On a team with only one senior, 
Bronner and Dobbs’ leadership 
skills will greatly determine the 
outcome of the season. They will
have a great opportunity to shape

With the freshmen on the team

begin playing excellent ball again.
Coach Wingen emphasized the 
need for fan support. “If fans will

be supportive, we will pay [the 
fans] off with some good wins.”
The Tartans will have a final

NFL NEWS
by Dave Martin
Monday night’s game between 
eated New York and the 
iapless Colts ended pretty much 
suspected. The Giants domi- 
iated the Colts from the starting 
un to the end, but didn’t do de- 
loiistrative damage.
The Giants now are looking 
jrWard to a December 3 Monday 
jght matchup with the only other 
mdefeated.team in the National 
football League—the San Fran- 
isco 49ers.
As the season heads into the 
econd half, playoff spots are 
apidly filling in. The AFC’s par- 
icipants are a given, except in 
he Central division, where things 
re still competitive.
The AFC East still hinges on a 
ate-December game between 
Juffalo and Miami, the loser of 
rinch will be the top seeded wild 
ard.
The AFC West will come down 
the race between the Kansas 
Sty Chiefs and the Los Angeles 
(aiders, who still have a game 
emaining in L.A. The winner of 
hat game should probably go on 
take the division, with the loser 
•ceiving the second wild card. 
The AFC Central, though, is 
omewhat trickier, with Pitts- 
iirgh and Cincinnati tied for first 
top the division, and the Hous- 
bn,,Oilers only a game behind, 
'ovember 18 will prove to be the 
ici'ding date for the Central Di- 
ision, with Pittsburgh at Cincin­
nati and Houston playing at 
Cleveland.
The winner of the Steelers- 
Bengals game will go on to win 
the division, and if Houston beats 
Cleveland, the Oilers will then be 
in position to steal the wild card 
game from the loser of the Steelers 
game.
AFC Playoff predictions: Miami 
from the East, the Raiders from 
the West, with Buffalo the best 
wild card, the Oilers the number 
two wild card, against the Chiefs 
as wild card three, and the 
Steelers winning the Central and 
playing the winner of the wild 
card tournament.
The NFC is somewhat a murkier 
situation on the wild card level. 
The division champs have all but 
been decided, with New York, San 
Francisco, and Chicago clinching 
their divisions sometime in the 
next three weeks.
The wild card spots are up for 
grabs, except one. The Redskins 
will take the number one wild 
card save a major catastrophe in 
D.C.
But the other two wild card 
spots could end up in the hands of 
teams with losing records. Green 
Bay and Tampa Bay will vie for 
the number two and three wild 
card spots, while the NFC West 
may come away with none. Their 
only possibility at this juncture is 
Atlanta, and that is a huge ques­
tion mark.
NFC playoffs: San Francisco, 
Chicago, and New York all divi­
sion champs, with the Redskins 
at the number one wild card, 
number two Tampa Bay, number 
three Green Bay, or by some wild 
turn of events, Detroit.
Tonight’s Monday Night Foot­

interesting one. The Redskins,

what trickier, with Pittsburgh and Cin­

The game will take place in

will be key, and will decide the 
winner. Redskins 34, Eagles 24.
Sunday, Chicago faces strug­
gling Denver at Mile High Sta­
dium, and should hand the 
Broncos yet another loss at home. 
The Rams are hoping to salvage

What does the NFL care about 
King’s birthday? The NFL oper­
ates on its own political system, 
it shouldn’t have any involve­

I say if the NFL takes Super

dinator Terry Bodnar. “We made 
some mistakes [in the first half] 
but we came out and played bet­
ter in the second half.”
The offense got going early, 
scoring on its first possession. 
Snyder engineered an eight-play, 
63-yard drive, capped off by a 13- 
yard touchdown run by senior 
fullback Fran Bellante. Senior Joe 
Schwerha’s extra point made the 
score 7-0 with 10:52 left in the 
first quarter.
Case answered with a score of 
its own. Freshman quarterback 
Brett Ramsey, coming off of a 
200-yard performance against 
Oberlin last week, hit senior re­
ceiver Jamie Meek for 48 yards on 
third-and-seven to give the 
Spartans first down on the Tar­
tan 23. Five plays later, Larry 
Coyne booted a 26-yard field goal 
to narrow the gap, 7-3.
The Tartans struck again on 
their next possession, bringing 
the ball downfield 67 yards in 
seven plays. The drive was keyed 
by a 44-yard Snyder-to-Barnyak 
pass on third-and-one which gave 
the Tartans a first down on Case’s 
14 yardline. Five plays later, 
Snyder scored the Tartans’ second 
touchdown on a quarterback 
sneak. Schwerha nailed the extra 
point, and the Tartans led 14-3 
with 4:20 to go in the quarter.
Case’s first possession of the 
second quarter ended with a mis­
hap. The drive stalled and they 
lined up to punt. On a designed 
fake, up-back Jeff Bennett took 
the snap and tried to throw for 
the first down. But the pass was 
overthrown, and the Tartans took 
over at their own 41.
After two rushing plays picked 
up a first down, a clipping penalty 
pushed the Tartans back to their 
own 38 and gave them first-and- 
23. On the next play, Snyder con­
nected with Barnyak for a 62- 
yard touchdown.
“We ran the same play earlier, 
to Wayne, and it was overthrown,” 
said Snyder.
“When you go back, you’ve got 
to see what’s given to you. I 
thought maybe Wayne was going 
to get open again. That time they 
jumped him and I looked and Scott 
was wide open.”
Schwerha’s extra point brought 
the score to 21-3 and the Tartans 
seemed in control of the game. 
But Case took control on the en­
suing possession, marching 74 
yards on five plays for its first
“We were frustrated a lot in the first 
half, but then we came out in the 
second half and challenged their line­
men and everything started working 
well/’

Matt Pielert
touchdown. The drive was keyed 
by fullback Jarvis Gibson’s 57- 
yard run on a pitchout that gave 
Case first down at the CMU one 
yardline. Two plays later, Ramsey 
plunged across the goal line to 
put Case back in the game, 21— 
10.
Minutes later, CMU scored 
again, capping off a 12-play, 51- 
yard drive. The critical play came 
on second down from the Case 13. 
Barnyak rushed for four yards 
and would have been short of the 
first down, but a facemask penalty 
against the Spartans gave CMU 
a first down at the four. On the 
next play, Barnyak took the ball 
in and the Tartans had some 
breathing room; leading 28-10.
But in this bizarre, high-scor­
ing first half, which saw touch­
downs on four consecutive drives, 
Case had the final score. Ramsey 
went to work, hitting Ken 
Holloway for completions of 19 
and 11, and Ken Mazzei for a 14- 
yard completion to give Case first 
down at the Tartan 18. Then, on 
first-and-10, Ramsey connected 
with Meek for the second Spartan 
touchdown. Coyne’s extra point 
sent Case in at halftime down by 
only eleven points, 28—17.
But after a shaky start, the 
Tartan defense regrouped and 
held Case scoreless.
“We were frustrated a lot in the 
first half,” said linebacker Matt 
Pielert. “But then we came out in 
the second half and challenged 
their linemen and everything 
started working well.”
“Coach Bodnar challenged us 
in the second half,” said senior 
defensive lineman Carlos 
Rodriguez. “We knew we couldn’t 
let them score again and as it 
turned out, we came through and 
held them.”
The Tartan offense, meanwhile, 
added a touchdown in each of the 
final two quarters.“We were fired 
up,” said Wilson. “It was disap­
pointing that we didn’t score 50.”
CMU began the second half as
it began the game, with a touch­
down. After Case was forced to 
punt on its first possession, 
Snyder and the Tartans took over 
at their own 18-yardline. A big 
15-yard scramble by Bellante on 
third-and-seven brought the 
Tartans out of a hole and gave 
them first down at their own 36.
Then, on third-and-one from the 
45, Snyder connected with half­
back Drew Pizzurro for 36 yards 
and a first down to the Case 19. 
Six plays later, Barnyak took the 
ball in from two yards out for his 
third touchdown of the game. 
Schwerha’s extra point gave the 
Tartans a 35-17 lead midway 
through the third quarter.
The Tartans’ final score came 
after another mistake by Case’s 
special teams’ unit midway 
through the fourth quarter. Thè 
Spartans lined up to punt on 
fourth-and-six, but a low snap 
forced punter Chuck Thall to run. 
Tartan defenders dropped Thall 
for a loss of one and the Tartans 
took over at their own 29.
Backup quarterback Sam 
Mangano stepped into the game, 
and put together a four-play, 29- 
yard scoring drive. The drive was 
keyed by a 19-yard pass from 
Mangano to Pizzurro that gave 
the Tartans first down at the Case 
15. Three plays later, fullback 
Greg Marmol rambled 12 yards 
for a touchdown, and Schwerha 
booted the extra point, to bring 
the final score to 42—17.
The Tartans’ next challenge is 
game one of the Division III 
playoffs this Saturday. Pairings 
for the first round were made 
yesterday, and the Tartans will 
face Lycoming, and Ferrum will 
face former Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference rival Washington & 
Jefferson.
“There’s not going to be an easy 
game from here on out,” said 
Snyder.”
The playoff game will be broad­
cast on WRCT 88.3 FM at 12:30 
pm.

for first round of playoffs
PLAYOFFS, from page 13
other areas of the country, either 
the first place team or the first 
and second placed teams are 
undefeated, but in every other 
section, the third and fourth 
placed teams either have one loss 
or a loss and a tie.”
Before Saturday’s games, the 
Tartans were ranked fifth in the 
South. CMU, along with the top 
four teams, was undefeated. 
Ferrum College and Washington 
and Jefferson, riding on their 
previous playoff successes, are 
ranked first-.and second-in the 
South, respectively. .W&J, 
Frostburg State, and Lycoming 
all have connections to the selec­
tion committee, another possible 
explanation for the rankings.
The Tartans also had strength 
of schedule in their favor; only 
one of the teams ahead of CMU 
had a tougher schedule. Ferrum 
College, for example, boasted a 
schedule of opponents that had a 
combined winning percentage of 
27 percent, including five teams 
that have only won one game.
Providing a victory over Case, 
the Tartans were relying on the 
help of either Ferrum, or 
Frostburg State, or both. Satur­
day, Ferrum played Dayton, 
thel989 National Champions, at 
Dayton and lost 42-22. Frostburg
“I’m as excited as anything. It’s been 
a goal that we’ve always had since 
I’ve been here. It’s a dream come 
true for me. ”
— Senior quarterback Billy Snyde
State played Waynesburg College 
at Waynesburg and suffered a 28-
18 loss that puts them out of the 
running for post-season play.
Prior to leaving for the game 
against Case, Lackner 
remarked,“We can only control 
one thing and that is our game 
against Case Western. After that, 
it’s out of our hands. If the com­
mittee deems us worthy of the 
playoffs, that’s great. If they deem 
us not worthy, then that’s their 
opinion, but I’ll be disappointed, 
not for myself, but for our team 
and especially the seniors, be­
cause they deserve to go.”
Yesterday, at approximately 3 
pm, the official word was in. The 
Tartans had made the playoffs. A 
the same time, it was announced 
that CMU would be paired with 
Lycoming, and F errum with W & J.
“I’m as excited as anything,” 
said senior quarterback Billy 
Snyder. “It’s been a goal that we’ve
always had since I’ve been her; 
The individual accomplishment 
we’ve made are additional resul 
of playing as a team. It’s a (Sea 
come true for me.”
Senior halfback Scott Batijyi 
added,“It’s one of the goals'.! .hai 
at the beginning of the season 
and I’m glad I was able toVcon 
tribute in achieving this goaDi 
been a few years since we’veijee 
in the playoffs, and I’m hopin, 
that maybe we can rally4 
campus around that.”
The Tartans are somewhatdl 
appointed about playip 
Lycoming and not W&J. “We’j 
just happy to be in there,” s! 
Snyder. “Hopefully we’ll pla 
them (W&J) in the secondroum 
Snyder is optimistic of CM1 
chances against Lycoming. 
just have to score a lot of point 
against their defense.”

Kviz makes 
recycling a 
way of life 
atCMU
By ERIC J. MCANALLEN
Tartan Contributing Editor
For Barbara Kviz, recycling is 
nore than a job, it’s a way of life. 
Jut since being hired in Septem- 
jer to act as a recycling coordina- 
or, it’s both.
‘I’ve been recycling all my life,” 
ays Kviz. “Where I grew up in the 
liidwest we happen to have a 
¿cycling station in town. My 
amily is from the country, so 
we’ve always recycled. It’s always 
jeen something I’ve been inter­
red in and something that I’ve 
jeen doing for most of my life.”
Kviz is no newcomer to Carnegie 
Mellon. She spent three years as a 
acliatftm specialist for CMU’s 
)epartment of Environmental 
lealth and Safety.
From what she’s seen here so 
ar, she says that it seems that 
leople and individual departments 
ire behind the recycling effort. 
"What I hope to do,” she says, “is 
i bring it all together and make it 
fork in a more cohesive fashion — 
ictually pull all the results to­
other and see a savings and a 
vaste reduction for the whole 
:ampus.”
Kviz’s interest in recycling has 
anded her more than just a 
¡amegie Mellon paycheck. With 
;ood memories of the Earth Day 
>roject that took place while she 
vas in high school, Kviz became 
nvolved in the Pittsburgh’s 
elebration of the Earth Day that 
ook place last April.
“I made a phone call and volun- 
eered,” she says. “Before I knew 
t, I was the recycling coordinator 
or the whole Earth Day Project at 
’oint State Park.” Kviz considers 
ler Earth Day involvement a

Carnegie Mellon will go above and

truich waste as we possibly can as 
^vell as reduce the amount of

Recycling is an essential part of keeping 
our environment clean and safe. It si­
multaneously answers two questions that 
many nations are having to face: “Where 
do we get the resources necessary for 
production?” and “Where do we store the 
products tha.t we no longer need?”
Since the recycling process begins with 
the collection of recyclable materials, 
communities all around the world, in­
cluding Carnegie Mellon’s, have tried to 
make recycling more convenient for their 
residents.
At CMU, this includes the placement of 
aluminum can trash bins in convenient 
locations and boxes for paper placed near 
printers in computer clusters.
So what do students do when they see 
an aluminum bin on campus? Do they pay 
attention to the boxes next to the printers 
in the computer clusters? Is recycling re­
ally that important?
According to H&SS sophomore Chandra 
Buist, students do not realize the impor­
tance of recycling. “I do not believe that 
enough people make any efforts to preserve 
our environment,” she says. “Students 
should recycle whenever they can. I think 
there should be more recycling bins for 
glass and paper. Doesn’t anyone have any 
concept of the way our environment is 
deteriorating? Just keep it, up and you’ll 
be sorry.”
Many others also feel that the opportu­
nities for recycling are limited. H&SS 
sophomore Nicole Sweeting agrees that 
there is a need for more glass and paper 
bins. “I think they pay attention if there is 
a bin close to them, but not many go out of 
their way to [recycle],” says Sweeting.
Both MCS junior Heather O’Donnell 
and MCS senior Curtis Ball say that they 
do not go out of their way to recycle. Ball 
says he is typical when it comes to using 
the bins. “Like everyone else, I recycle 
when it is convenient,” he says.
There are even a few students who feel
ApH •co1Tw vl nUM .fltpgw gchThsco cxagv
that recycling does not make that much of 
a difference. “I really don’t recycle much,” 
says H&SS sophomore Eben Adams. “I 
think it’s good — it’s not hard to do or 
anything—but I also feel that aluminum 
cans are insignificant compared to the 
amount of damage that major industrial 
corporations do to the environment,” he 
said.
“One way to increase the use of the 
recycling bins is to locate the bins more 
strategically,” says CFA junior Dana 
Martinelli. “There are bins by the soda 
machines, but who finishes a soda at the
D. A. Henderson /Tartan Darkroom Manager 
hprtco py v HtpspuT svH tl Rfla PtHgvgTm
machine? You buy them there, not drink 
them.
“Students are aware of the need to re­
cycle, but it is not always very accessible. 
For example, I live in an apartment which 
makes it more difficult.”
CFA junior Jennifer Kilian, a Resnik 
House RA, says that her hall is good about 
using the bins for aluminum. However, 
students wishing to recycle glass have to 
take the bottles to the basement of 
Hamerschlag Hall. This is an inconve­
nience for students — more than most are 
willing to undergo.
Some CMU students would recycle more 
often, but are experiencing difficulties 
because of where they live. CIT sopho­
more Dave Newman; who lives in Shirley 
Apartments, complains, “There are bins 
for cans on each floor in Shirley and on 
each floor they are overflowing. They have 
been this way for so long that students 
are no longer making an effort to recycle 
their cans.”
Newman also says he thinks students 
should at least make an effort to recycle 
cans. “If there are no bins close by, it will 
only be a second longer before one comes 
up. So what if you have to hold on to your 
can a little bit longer?” said Newman.
CFA sophomore Dave Ewald utilizes 
the bins on campus. “At Pika [Pi Kappa 
Alpha], there are places for cans which 
are full on the weekends,” he says “But 
during the week no one uses them that 
much. We drink a lot of milk!”
Some students have made recycling a 
larger part of their lives. As members of 
Student Environmental Action Coalition 
(SEAC), members address issues like rain 
forest destruction, toxic waste, and ani­
mal rights, as well as recycling.
SEAC was first started last year when 
students from CMU attended a conference 
at the University of North Carolina. When 
they returned, they formed a small or­
ganization that was concerned with 
campaigning for more recycling and 
spreading and other issues.
Concerning recycling, SEAC member 
Sivaraman Balachandran, a CIT sopho­
more, says that he’s certainly for it, but 
“the campus community is not doing 
enough andis not telling people to recycle. 
They have simply put the aluminum bins 
out hoping people will respond.” He also 
feels that glass and paper recycling bins 
are not well-known or well-placed.
Goals that Balachandran thinks SEAC 
is looking to achieve this year include 
finding a way to cut down the paper waste 
in the departments. The organization is 
also considering a campus-wide energy 
audit to see how energy-efficient the 
campus buildings are.

City forced to 
clean up act
By DAN HOLLAND
'/ Tartan Senior Staffwriter
M Clean air has always been a 
¡1 precious commodity in the 
i* twentieth century, especially in 
Pittsburgh. From the dark,
; smoke-laden sides of the early 
J 1940s to the toxic air pollutants 
; of the 1980s, Pittsburghers have 
! fought to ensure that their 
environment is as clean as 
possible. The recently passed 
Clean Air Act of 1990 was an 
enormous success for environ­
mental groups, which claimed 
victory over major U.S. indus­
tries, many of which are in and 
¡around Pittsburgh.
! Certainly, the environmental- 
I ists did not have an easy time
• getting the legislation passed.
¦ They faced heavy opposition 
;Hrpm industry proponents who 
¡¡joutspent them by millions of
; "dollars on lobbying and adver­
tising campaigns. However, 
environmental concerns ulti­
mately prevailed in the minds of 
the nation's legislators, who 
-enacted the first clean air 
legislation since 1977.
Much of the support for the 
/&jll came from grass-roots 
, .organizations here in Pitts­
burgh. Numerous non-profit,
. .citizen-supported groups 
developed a close bond between 
the people of Pittsburgh and the 
lawmakers who engineered the 
new law.
One such group is Clean 
; Water Action (CWA), a national 
! Organization with one million 
! members and 26 regional offices 
i nationwide. Its regional center 
> in Pittsburgh pushed for strin- 
; $ent requirements in the ozone 
; protection portion of the bill and 
' worked to strengthen municipal 
\vaste incinerator provisions.
\ CWA, like many environmental- 
i i!st groups, runs a phone bank 
! and door-to-door canvas opera-
• tion to educate the public and 
raise support. CWA Projects 
Coordinator Lorraine Smith 
feels that keeping in touch with 
Congress is a vital factor. “We 
were successful in alerting the 
congressmen about the [munici-
• pal waste incinerator] provi-
¦ sions, otherwise they wouldn’t 
; have known about it.”
CWA hires many high school 
and college students to help run 
the many activities of the 
organization. Galen Scott, 19, 
musters citizen support for 
environmental legislation by 
telephone. “We call people on 
fcjie phone and tell them about 
tjie Ozone Protection Act, for 
instance. We tell them to write 
tjo their Senator and ask him to 
support the bill,” he explains.
! Another organization, the 
Pennsylvania Public Interest 
Research Group (Penn PIRG), 
set up their first year-round 
office in Pittsburgh this year to 
work specifically on the Clean
Air Act. Penn PIRG is part of a 
larger network of 25 state 
PIRGs run from a national 
headquarters in Washington. 
Assistant Campaign Director of 
Penn PIRG, Liz Norby explains 
that “door-to-door campaining is 
the best way to raise support.
It’s cheap, especially when you 
are outspent by industries a 
thousand to one.” With 3,000 
supporters in Pittsburgh alone 
and over a million nationwide, 
PIRG's success lies with the 
citizens as voters. “The key is 
citizen support,” Norby says. 
“Our membership base provides 
us with political power to 
pressure Congress.”
These local groups form larger 
coalitions to gain political clout in 
Congress. The National Clean Air 
Coalition in Washington, D.C. is 
comprised of many different envi­
ronmental organizations, includ­
ing the United Steelworkers of 
America (USWA), the Sierra Club, 
the National Resources Defense 
Council, U.S. PIRGs, and many 
others. These large coalitions 
achieved much of their success in 
Washington by employing persis­
tent lobbyists to fight on Capitol 
Hill for tight measures in the 
Clean Air Act.
Various corporations did the 
same and formed the Clean Air 
Working Group, a coalition of 
industry proponents who 
attempted to sway Congress to 
their side. Despite the millions 
of lobbying dollars spent, many 
of the industries in and around 
Pittsburgh were the big losers 
in the Clean Air Act. The coke- 
oven provisions in the Air 
Toxics section of the bill will be 
one of the hardest standards for 
industries to manage in the 
coming years.
United States Steel Director 
of Public Affairs Tom Farrell 
explained his side of the story: 
“We see the coke oven provi­
sions as extremely costly to us 
and the industry. We are 
concerned about the residual- 
risk provisions which are based 
on mathematical models, and 
we can give no assurance that 
coking operations will meet the 
standards by 2020.”
LTV Steel’s Public Relations 
Director Debbi Kavlech said 
that the company is working 
first to achieve the short-term 
goals stipulated in the air toxics 
section of the Clean Act.
“Within the next three to five 
year period, there will be very 
strict stipulations to meet. We 
will have to meet those stan­
dards,” she said. But the re­
sidual risk provisions are the 
hardest for companies to 
achieve. “Beyond the first stage, 
it is too early to speculate. We 
feel we can meet the initial 
standards. There are programs 
in place now to address this 
issue,” she added.
Currently, coke ovens in the

Pittsburgh area emit large 
amounts of carcinogenic ben­
zene. The LTV coke works in 
Hazelwood produces the second 
largest quantity of toxic air 
pollutants in the county (1.3 
million pounds), after the 
county leader, the USS Clairton 
coke works, which spews out 3 
million pounds of toxic air 
pollutants. These two areas 
currently contribute to the 7 
million pounds of toxic chemi­
cals produced by Allegheny 
County industries—that is over 
2 million pounds of known 
carcinogens, which makes this 
county the nation’s leader in 
benzene pollution.
However, steps are being 
made to alleviate these prob­
lems. The Clairton works 
reported a 2.5 million pound 
reduction of its toxic emissions. 
According to Farrell, “the 
industry has eliminated 95% of 
coke-oven emissions.”
Pittsburgh’s Penn PIRG 
worked hard to pass strong 
acid-rain provisions, which are
crucial for Pennsylvania since it 
has some of the worst acid rain. 
These provisions will mainly 
affect electric plants which 
often burn high sulfur coal. 
Some plants in Pittsburgh 
already meet the requirements. 
Ken Service, the Director of 
Corporate Information for the 
Duqesne Light Company, says, 
“Our plants already meet these 
provisions. We were one of the 
first [electric companies] in the 
country to implement these 
controls.”
However, many others will 
fall short of the 10-million-ton 
reduction of sulfur dioxide 
emissions by the year 2000. To 
prevent catastrophic job loss, 
Congressman Bob Wise of West 
Virginia fought hard to win 
legislation to provide $50 
million in yearly benefits for 
workers displaced by the effects 
of such environmental controls, 
especially the numerous coal 
miners in his district.
Naturally, industries are 
concerned that such provisions

will be costly (close to $25 
billion per year). But environ­
mentalists claim that without 
environmental controls, the 
costs would average about $50 
billion annually. In addition, 
that figure does not take into 
account long-term damages to 
water, soil, and wildlife, as well
as continuing health hazards,

Kappa Alpha Theta rallies over $2000 for charity
By TRUPTIPATEL
fartan Asst. Features Editor
The Miss America Pageant may be the 
most touted beauty contest around, but 
the Mr. Fraternity contest was definitely 
more entertaining, more rambunctious, 
and more unpredictable.
CMU’s Kappa Alpha Theta sorority 
held the fourth annual Mr. Fraternity in 
the Skibo Ballroom on Friday evening. 
Representatives from thirteen campus 
fraternities participated in the event in 
order to benefit the Karin Johnson Me­
morial Asthma Research Fund.
Five different contestants received 
prizes for their creative and sometimes 
iizarre performances in the show. First 
place was garnered by sophomore Jason 
¦Bareford of Phi Kappa Theta, while 
second place went to sophomore Bill 
£dams of Pi Kappa Alpha. Matt Fowler 
pf Kappa Sigma took third place. George 
Schevon of Alpha Tau Omega and Twig 
Gallemore of Theta Xi tied for the Mr. 
Congeniality award.
The contest lasted close to three hours 
ind included four segments, each of was 
judged by a panel of six judges, from 
PMU’s Student Affairs division. Each of 
the fraternity representatives was given 
¡n individual score in the four categories 
According to Mr. Fraternity contest rules.
The scores from judges counted for 
two-thirds of the contestants’ scores; the 
remaining one-third of the scores came 
Prom votes cast by the audience. Every 
member of the audience who retained 
bis or her ticket could use the ticket to 
vote for the candidate of his or her choice; 
this voting took place between the third 
tnd fourth segments of the contest.
The four parts of the Mr. Fraternity 
contest included competitions in beach 
'ear, toga wear, talent, and formal wear. 
The beach wear competition consisted of

each of the representatives modeling 
beach wear and exemplifying the types 
of activities that commonly take place on 
the beach. Mr. Alpha Epsilon Pi, J. David 
Rosen, came up with one of the most 
creative performances by playing the 
nerdy beach tourist taking pictures of 
everyone. Some of the fraternity mem­
bers modelled interesting toga contrap­
tions during the toga wear competition.
Pika’s Adams modelled a metallic toga 
while dancing to the Bee Gees’ Stayin’ 
Alive; ATO’s Schevon was made up to 
look like the Statue of Liberty.
Kappa Sig*s Fowler displayed his abili­
ties to bong goldfish in the talent compe­
tition. Other interesting talent competi­
tion performances included Justin Zier 
of SAE lip-synching Depeche Mode’s 
“Somebody” along with a slide show pre­
sentation of his love life. SigTau’s Jamie 
Eaton displayed some amazing bicycling 
talents by maneuvering his bicycle for­
wards, backwards, and upside down. The 
competition ended with the formal wear 
modelling in which the contestants 
donned tuxedos and answered a ques­
tion posed by the master of ceremonies.
According to Mr Fraternity chair Kelly 
Garvey, a Theta sister, approximately 
$2,100 was raised on Friday in order to 
benefit the Karin Johnson Fund.
The amount of money raised was a 
surprise for Garvey as well as other sis-

ters because it went far beyond the 
amount they had originally hoped to 
raise. Garvey had said, “We hope to raise 
about $1,500'dollars this year. I think we 
should be able to do it since we raised 
$1,300 last year.” Approximately 550 
people packed the ballroom on Friday.
The money raised will go to the Karin

If you are familiar with the 
films of director David Lynch, 
you will probably understand 
the complaints about their of­
fensive content. Lynch has an 
unmatched ability to shock the 
viewer and show that he will 
stop at nothing to do it.
On Friday, Sharon Willis dis­
cussed the sexist and racist 
themes prominent in Lynch’s 
film Wild At Heart with Carnegie 
Mellon students.
The movie’s opening scene 
shows a black man attack the 
main character, Sailor, with a 
knife. Sailor dodges the attack, 
gets on top of his assailant, and 
smashes his head on the marble 
floor until his brains fall out of 
his head.
You may say “That’s nothing,
I saw somebody get their intes­
tines ripped out in Night of the 
Living Dead” yet the sound ef­
fects and the camera angles used 
by Lynch make his violence ex­
ceptionally realistic and dis­
turbing. Willis’s criticism of 
Lynch is focused mainly on his 
depiction of women as cruel, 
perverse, and obsessive and of 
black men as tools in their pur­
suit of perverted desires.
The opening scene was 
brought about by Marrietta, 
whose daughter, Lula, Sailor’s
girlfriend. She sent the man to 
kill Sailor after he refused to “fuck 
Lula’s mama” in the men’s room. 
The rest of the movie is about 
Marrietta’s attempt to kill Sailor, 
who is running away with her 
daughter. According to Willis, the 
film has “a structure of effects” 
reeking of these sexist and racist 
overtones.
One of the things that makes 
Wild At Heart so disturbing is the 
combination of sex and violence 
tied together by techniques such 
as using the same music during 
scenes containing these two op­
posite types of behavior.
Lynch’s popularity is due to a 
number of things says Willis, 
butmainly to his ability to shock 
and his willingness to take 
things too far. His bizarre cam^ 
era angles leave the viewer dis­
oriented and confused while 
drawing attention to grotesque 
details.
While watching Wild at Heart 
one gets the sensation that 
Lynch is “playing with your 
mind.” As Willis says, his films 
“expose the dark side of ordinary 
life in our culture” and promote 
the view that “all reality is 
relative.”

President Bush should think before using metaphors
I don’t want to blow this all out 
•of proportion. Obviously, when 
¡compared with such things as 
¡famine, the crisis in the Gulf, and 
the reelection of Jesse Helms, the 
jdilemma of having the right thing 
¡to say seems completely trivial. 
But consider the last sentence.
If I had not followed the words 
¡“famine” and “the crisis in the 
Gulf’ with something “politically 
correct” like “the reelection of 
Jesse Helms,” but with something 
(¡¡“funnylike “pocket lint,” I might 
have caused egregious offense to 
famine victims and people in­
volved with the crisis in the Gulf;
I still wonder if the laughs I may 
get by bringing up the Axis as a 
comedic tool are worth the images 
which the word evokes.
Recently a friend of mine told 
me that his significant other 
dumped him. There was the 
obligatory chorus of pained ouches 
¡and oohs, but they could not defer 
the point at which verbal com-, 
¡munication* would have to come 
into play. I opened my mouth and 
the question that came out was, 
“Badly?”
I was immediately struck by 
the utter redundancy inherent in 
my question. How can someone 
be “well dumped”? The adoption 
¡of a different track was certainly in order.
Unfortunately, it is the ten­
dency of human onversation to 
move from unpleasant topic to 
methodology, thereby extending 
the discussion of the unpleasant 
topic into near-eternity. Com­
pletely ignoring my knowledge of 
this, I asked another question. 
How did she do it?”
Why? Why did I have to ask 
that when I was fully aware of the 
act that this would only stretch 
is agony and my embarrassment 
at my inability to say anything 
s lghtly resembling reassurance.
, e exPlained to me that he had

!°mputer link-up between CMU

“Is there anything that I can 
say that won’t make me sound 
like a dunce?”
“No.”
Some believe that people talk to 
remind themselves of their own 
existence. If this is so, there is 
way too much existence. Of course, 
few, if any, take the last resort of 
listening when in a situation such 
as the above. Perhaps this is be­
cause the phrase “taking things 
for granted” has been given 
expletive status in our culture. A 
good measure of how “taking 
things for granted” has been stig­
matized in our society can be found 
in the number of Love Boat epi­
sodes which feature a parent/ 
spouse/significant other/lounge
singer being accused by their re­
spective offspring/spouse/signifi- 
cant other/lounge singer with the 
phrase “You are taking me for 
granted!”
But some things must be taken 
for granted because there is no 
utility in repeating “That’s bad, 
no that’s really bad, gosh, that’s 
bad, I mean, that’s bad” to some­
one who has just had an electric 
cattle prod attached to his or her 
genitals.
It is people who do not take the 
obvious for granted who make life 
difficult. The stain of excessive 
talk runs from the mundane — 
the late night D J who announces, 
“and now another LONG half- 
hour of musi-c”—to the dangerous 
— the American President who 
declares that Saddam Hussein is 
engaged in “a brutality that I don’t 
believe Adolf Hitler participated 
in.”
In comparing Adolf Hitler not 
once, but four times to Hussein 
(his references include a com­
parison of the murder of Kuwaiti 
children to actions by Hitler’s 
Death’s Head Battalions and the 
statements “We. are dealing with

Hitler revisited,” and, “when 
Hitler’s war ended there were the 
Nuremberg trials”), George Bush 
is committing a language violence 
which is no way comparable to 
the violence of a full scale war in 
the Gulf but should be addressed 
nevertheless.
Bush’s reliance on a rhetoric of 
war which evokes a different time, 
geopolitical situation and the 
suffering of 14 million who are 
not here to vouch for the 
President’s comparison and for 
whom I have no agency to speak, 
brings into question whether or 
not he himself believes in the va­
lidity of his own argument for 
Operation Desert Shield.
The point I am arguing is not 
whether our operations in the 
Middle East are justified, but 
whether the manner in which this 
conflict is being defined by those 
who put us into it truly represents 
the motivation which led them to 
put us there in the first place. The 
fight for cheap oil, or for the in­
tegrity of the global economy, or 
the wounded pride of the United 
States, or the sovereignty of Ku­
wait, are not subjects fit for com­
parison with the Second World 
War.
I am sure that humanity has 
the capacity to replicate the hor­
ror of the Second World War sev­
eral times over, but not this time, 
not in Saudi Arabia. To validate 
the conflict in the Gulf by cloak­
ing it with comparisons to a con­
flict which many view as the last 
example of the clear-cut black- 
and-white struggle between good 
and evil in human history is an 
insult to those who died in the 
Second World War and to those 
who may die if the conflict with 
Iraq escalates into a full-blown 
war.
I am often surprised at the ease 
with which terms like “Hitler,” 
“fascist,” and “I love you,” are 
tossed about for mere conve­
nience. While none of these terms 
are any less powerful for it — 
because many have made it their 
business to keep intact the 
meaning which these words have 
earned through history — they 
are still subject to misuse by those 
whose business it is to make jus­
tifiable the existence of misguided 
actions and ideas.
As tempting as the use of word$ 
such as “Hitler/’ “fascist,” “I lové 
you,” and even qualifiers such as 
“racism,” “sexism,” and “homo­
phobia,” may be, their misuse only 
serves to reassert the severity of 
that which they truly represent, a 
severity which we should all tak$ 
for granted. f
As far as evil, fascism, intoler­
ance, hatred and even true love 
are concerned, these things will 
manifest themselves and be rec­
ognized regardless of how we 
choose to disguise or not disguise 
them.
What does this leave for Presi}- 
dent Bush, and the rest of us? 
Perhaps we should take heed of 
another bit of World War Two 
rhetoric which is better suited to 
this and any other situation. It is 
the caption once printed on postj 
ers warning citizens of the danf 
ger of Axis spies lurking arounc} 
every corner. !

Pynamic Duo destroyed by sentimental car thieves!
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO 
PLATINUM BLONDES?
_______by Andrew Cosentino
From this moment on, let the ink on 
this page serve as documented proof of 
¡the occurrence of an emotionally moving 
¡story. Not a story of a human struggle for 
¡survival, or even that of a boy and his 
‘dog, but one which rivals the likes of The 
\Boy in the Plastic Bubble and Old Yeller.
You see, CMU Senior Jerry Gagnon’s 
¡best buddy has been abducted. Forcefully 
¡taken from the very spot outside Jerry’s 
¡house on Morewood Avenue, where the 
¡two used to meet each day. If not found 
•soon, it won’t be long before Jerry’s 
¡missing friend is altogether forgotten 
¡and the bulletin board down at the sta­
tion will be stripped of the vital message, 
¡“MISSING: ’67 Buick Special.”
Auto theft in Pittsburgh has been a 
¡long-standing problem. If only the 
¡carnappers realized that by taking this 
•particular ’67 Buick Special, they broke 
•up one of the great dynamic duos of man 
¡and machine. Both Jerry and the Special 
¡shared the common traits of being sturdy, 
¡on the large side, old-fashioned, and in 
¡no particular hurry to get anywhere. A 
¡true match made in heaven — and De­
troit.
“But a person can’t develop a friendship 
¡with an extremely large, rectangular 
'piece of steel on wheels!” shouts the dis- 
¡traught humanist in the audience. Ah, 
¡but often, my good humanist, steel is not 
¡as cold as the average Joe might think. 
¡For example, in his novel Zen and the Art 
\of Motorcycle Maintenance author Rob- 
jert Pirsig explains that “working on a 
¡motorcycle, working well, caring, is to 
¡become part of a process, to achieve an
inner peace of mind.” It just so happens 
that in a more recent work titled Jerry 
and the Art of Buick Special Mainte­
nance the relationship between man and 
machine is presented in much the same 
way. Jerry remembers that during feed­
ingtime he “used to be extremely careful 
that there were no agents from the EPA 
around before pouring lead additive into 
the Special’s gas tank.” True to Pirsig’s 
assertions, Jerry, by working diligently 
under the hood, achieved an inner peace 
of mind in knowing that upon consump­
tion of the lead cocktail (complete with a 
crystal funnel and Spanish olive 
skewered on the dipstick), the quenched 
Special would have no complaints about 
making the afternoon ride to Dairy 
Queen.
Yet, sadly enough,-while the Special, 
or what’s left of it, waits to be rescued 
from some dark side street or abandoned 
lot, it’s a good bet that the Dairy Queen 
napkins with which Jerry dabbed his 
moist brow just hours before the car was 
taken still sit in a neat pile on the front 
seat, as remnants of what used to be. 
That is, unless one of the thieves threw 
them out the window after blowing his 
stinking nose.
. As is the case with any strong friend­
ship, these driving companions learned 
to tolerate each other’s idiosyncrasies. 
In fact, the Special had so many of these 
quirks, with which only the closest of 
passengers could identify, that Jerry is 
still baffled as to how it could have been 
taken in such a short amount of time.
“Starting the Special was a subtle 
ritual. You needed to pull out the choke 
just the right amount and then goose the 
engine with the gas pedal, ever so slightly 
easing the choke back in. Amanual choke,
I might add.”
We, the law-abiding minority of the 
population, are led to believe that with 
deterrents like manual chokes and alarm 
systems, a crook’s gotta have a degree to 
steal a car. Well, this is either a huge 
misconception, or somewhere in Pitts­
burgh there’s a guy handing out master’s
degrees in car-theft like they’re burning 
a hole in his hand. Maybe that’s what’s 
been going on down the road at Pitt all 
these years.
Whatever the case, it just doesn’t make 
sense that even with metal contraptions
wrapped like contorted barbells around 
the steering wheels of every other parked 
car, somehow automobiles continue to 
disappear at such an alarming rate that 
we can’t seem to supply the curbs of this 
country with enough vehicles for profes-
sional thieves to get in a good eight-hour 
workday. 2™
What confuses Jerry is motive “[I§ 
was only worth about two hundred bucasi 
so why would they take it?” Perhaps the 
thief, particularly concerned over the 
threat of nuclear war, saw the steel-­
plated Special as a pre-assembled boirib 
shelter which, after the removal of thè 
wheels, could be put up on blocks in-his 
backyard. After watching a seemingly 
nervous, dark-haired man with a thick 
mustache repeatedly walk by their 
homes, Jerry’s friends are convinced tha^, 
Saddam Hussein took the Special as 4 
means of acquiring secrets of Americai) 
tank technology.. !
The experts, however, have come up 
with an entirely different explanation! 
As you might imagine, the Special, with 
a wide, couch-like back seat, had an 
extremely high sentimental value. This 
fact, combined with the low monetary 
value of this old Buick, has lead detectives 
to believe that an unpredictable, new 
breed of criminal has hit the streets of 
Pittsburgh; the age of the sentimental 
car thief has arrived. If you own a car 
over ten years of age, take any and ali 
memorabilia out of the vehicle immedif 
ately and watch your rig like a hawH 
until this thing blows over. ;
As for Jerry, he learned about this new 
wave of sentimental crime the hard wayl 
Just a victim, not of greed, but of a thief s 
actions being influenced by tender feel-1 
ings of emotion rather than by practical 
motives.
But even with the loss of his means of 
transportation, Jerry continues to dis-f 
play the same unselfishness on which 
his friendship with the Special was built! 
“I’m not as worried about how I’m going 
to get by without the Special, as I'm 
worried how the Special will get by with­
out me.”

Boner pops a sex scandal in the rumor-starved Nashville
When people deal with the‘S’- 
word in Southern politics (sex), 
they find that a great many vot­
ers in the South make political 
decisions according to the sexual 
conduct of the candidate.
If a person is considered a lib- 
eral-minded southerner, the 
most kinky thing he or she may 
. allow for in a candidate’s sex life 
is one divorce and one remar­
riage.
However, if someone is a con­
servative churchgoer, it is very 
¡difficult for a public figure to 
¡escape the criticism of his or her 
¡watchful eye. The most that a 
conservative churchgoer may 
allow for is one marriage, and it 
had better have been in a church.
Why is there such an obsession 
with good sexual conduct in the 
; South? And why are there pub­
lic figures who surround them­
selves with scandal regardless 
;of the religious and sexually 
'¡critical climate?
a bag of laughs for voting him into 
office, regardless of how much of a 
crook and a lecher he was. How­
ever, everyone is still looking at 
the people of Nashville and won­
dering what they are going to do 
with their superstar adulterer/ SOUTHERN COMFORT politician. Now that Phil Donahue 
by Alison Carter has taken him apart, Nashville 
will have even more of a mess to 
clean up after its mayor. I, for 
one, do not envy them their task.
The issue with Mister Boner is 
not one of sexual freedom. It is his 
inability to keep a promise. Poli­
ticians must be able to keep 
promises. As marriage is a prom­
ise, and he has now gone through 
four marriages, the writing should 
have been on the wall well before 
he ever became the mayor.
I still wonder why sex in South-

era politics is such a big scandal­
ous deal. I think that if honest 
candidates were voted into office, 
it would follow that they would
stay monogamous with, and love, 
whichever partner or spouse they 
chose to stay with for the rest of 
their lives or, at least, for the
duration of their office.
I personally think, being 
former citizen of Nashville, that 
the scandal was a boost to Boneri 
career — simply because of the 
fact that he is an overwhelmingly 
baaaad mayor.

lover to tell her side of the story.
All around, no matter how big a 
city is or how far south it is, the 
majority of the citizens will drool 
over sexual scandal. Yet they will 
cry over the particular public fig­
ure making their city look bad.
With the onset of such a scandal, 
one particular figure has not backed 
down from office or slunk off into 
hiding while he was in the public 
eye. He did not leave the woman, 
but rather continued the relation­
ship more openly to invite more 
popular comment. He became a 
star. He appeared on Donahue.
This Southern scandal has be-

¦events concerning sex scandal cussion all over the country. I have 
;in the South, it could be said just described the saga of Nashville 
¡that it was a final rebellion Mayor Bill Boner, lover, lecher, and 
¡against old ideals. The candi- superstar. Once he appeared on 
date or public figure, tired of Donahue, standing in the perver- 
dealing with criticism from the sion spotlight with the transsexual
voting majority, decides, “What 
the hell, I’m not going to get re- 
¦ elected anyway.” At that, he or 
¡she goes out, starts some cheesy 
¡relationship in a seedy hotel, 
¡and makes sure that everyone 
¡can see him or her having fun in 
¡bed for the first time since he or 
¡she was married.
! Then, as the waiting public 
¦drools for more to come, his or 
her horrified spouse leaves in 
the clear view of the entire scan­
dal-hungry population. Preach­
ers begin their sermons the next 
Sunday on the note of the dan- 
¦ Igers of sexual sin. Newspapers 
! want a part of the action too and 
' pay big bucks for the politician’s
transvestites and cross-dressing 
Hare Krishnas, no one could keep 
him out of view. Even New Yorkers, 
who shrug at hearing every sexual 
secret about every public figure 
that side of the Mason-Dixon line, 
were laughingup their sleeves over 
the whole deal.
But who was everyone laughing 
at? Was it just the mayor, who had 
chosen such an interesting man­
ner of political self-destruction, or 
was it also the entire city of Nash­
ville?
I have a feeling that it was both. 
Boner was a source of humor to 
those outside of Nashville because 
of his idiocy in making his affair so 
prevalent. Nashville was even more

Getting back to tradition and serving 
the community at the same time, the 
CMU chapter of Alpha Phi Omega held 
its Scout Day in Schenley Park last 
Saturday.
Each year, A Phi O holds Scout Day 
for troops within the Three Rivers 
District. Brothers from the service 
fraternity focus on teaching a specific 
skill to the scouts. This year, the skill 
focused on was pioneering and knot- 
tying. The scouts learned various 
methods of tying knots then used those 
knots to build towers with wood.
While this event is unique to the 
CMU chapter, other A Phi O chapters 
throughout the nation hold similar 
events.
The Carnegie Mellon chapter of A 
Phi 0, started in 1929, was the tenth 
chapter founded in the country. The 
first chapter was founded at 
Lafayette College in Easton, Penn­
sylvania, in the early 1920s who 
wanted to continue their Scouting 
work. CMU’s chapter has 50 active 
brothers (even the women are called 
brothers) and 13 pledges. Leader­
ship, friendship, and service are the 
principles they uphold. Membership 
vice president Ross Comer said, 
“Although we do a lot of service 
around the community we also have 
a lot of fun doing it. We also gain a 
lot through the fraternity in terms of 
leadership ability.”
In addition to Scouting, A Phi O 
also produces the C-Book, runs 
concessions stands at football games 
and Spring Carnival, and assists in 
faculty course evaluations at the end 
of each semester. Off campus, they 
support the United Way, and Jubilee 
Kitchen. Also, in the spring, A Phi O 
organizes Scout Swim, a program in 
which A Phi O brings 20 to 25 scouts 
to campus and teaches them how to 
swim in the Thistle Hall.

Contains the never-ending adven­

The Ruby Knight is the second 
book in Eddings’ series, The

his merry band as they search

Sparhawk’s queen, Ehlana, who

'ray the video Home Alone isn’t under your Christmas tree
Jy JASON McDONALD
jiartan Assistant Spoi'ts Editor
'With Christmas only a month 
way, it’s naturally time for the 
early barrage of Christmas films. 
\ome Alone is the first of many 
holiday films, and, while it offers 
ome new twists, it’s still pretty 
jtandard holiday fare.
The only thing that Home Alone 
has going for it is that it was 
ptten by John Hughes. Unfor- 
unately, it seems as if the label 
a John Hughes film” is not the 
ire thing it used to be.
¡.The plot of the film is relatively

goes on a Christmas vacation to

Candy in a cameo role.
glars who have' picked .his home 
as their next target.
The robbers, played by Joe Pesci 
and Daniel Stern, have a list of 
who’s going on vacation (Pesci 
dresses up as a police officer and 
goes from house to house “warn­
ing” the occupants to gain infor­
mation). They decide that Kevin’s 
house would make an ideal tar­
get. Kevin manages to trick the 
burglars into thinking the house
atch Chucky continue to toy with his victims in Child’s Play 2
is occupied until the film’s final 
confrontation, where he beats 
back the bad guys with an elabo­
rate network of booby traps (wet­
ting down the steps so they freeze, 
attaching a blowtorch to the door, 
etc.).
The final battle is definitely the 
high point of the film. No one 
event is hilarious, but Hughes 
just heaps the physical humor on 
and on, and the violence is so 
cartoonish that one has to laugh 
eventually.
In addition to the burglars, 
Kevin also has to come face-to- 
face with the standard “evil- 
misunderstood-neighbor-who’s- 
actually-a-pretty-decent-guy.” 
Kevin flees the guy under the 
mistaken impression that he’s a 
murderer that’s never been 
caught, but finally confronts him 
in church on Christmas Eve. The
old guy gives Kevin the tear-jerker 
“you don’t really hate your fam­
ily” speech. He also turns up in 
the final battle to save Kevin just 
when he’s run out of tricks.
Naturally, Home Alone offers 
the wholesome family theme; 
Kevin thinks he hates his family, 
and his family thinks he’s an­
noying. But when they’re sepa­
rated, both parties realize how 
wrong they were, setting up the 
obligatory tearful reunion (which 
of course occurs on Christmas 
morning) at the end of the film.
One of the biggest problems with 
the film is that Kevin’s character 
is too inconsistent. Far too often, 
Home Alone succumbs to the 
typical Hollywood need to make 
child heroes precocious smart­
asses instead of normal kids. 
Other times he is more like a 
usual eight-year-old, but he flips

back and forth far too often.
Predict ability is another major 
fault. In its effort to cater to the 
widest audience possible, Home 
Alone offers ultra-simple jokes 
that the average viewer can see 
coming from miles away. The plot 
was just as predictable.
A friend who saw Home Alone 
told me that I shouldn’t analyze it 
too much; I should just look at it 
as “anice little film.” There’s some
merit to that, I guess; it’s a good 
film for family viewing, and kids 
will enjoy it.
Unfortunately, it’s one of the 
most sappy films I’ve ever seen 
(even for a Christmas movie), and 
the plot is one of the stupidest, 
most superficial pieces of garbage 
I’ve ever encountered.
Don’t waste the money. There 
are plenty of better John Hughes 
films at the video store.

Like in Pinocchio, the touching 
childhood classic, all Chucky 
wants in life is to be a real boy. A 
very specific boy, actually. 
Chucky, a voice-activated Good 
Guy Doll, yearns for the day that 
he can become Andy Barclay, the 
six year old whose mother bought 
Chucky from a street vendor.
Chucky has a few advantages 
over Pinocchio. Instead of being 
made of wood, this doll is made of 
incredibly durable plastic and 
metal. Chucky’s nose never 
changes length, no matter how 
many lies he tells, and Chucky 
has the mind and soul of middle- 
aged criminal Charles Lee Ray.
In the original Child's Play 
Charles Lee Ray nearly meets his 
end when a police officer shoots 
him in the warehouse of a toy 
store. But Ray manages to get 
hold of one of the dolls from a shelf 
and, with a few magic words, be­
comes Chucky the doll. The ware-

house burns down, but Chucky 
survives and is found in the rubble 
by a vagrant. That’s where Andy 
Barclay’s mother, who can’t afford 
the hundred dollar retail price, 
grabs the opportunity to buy the 
doll at a reduced rate.
That’s when all hell breaks 
loose. Chucky has a few laughs 
killing people who tick him off, 
but when he visits the home of his 
occult mentor, he finds out that if 
he doesn’t act quickly, he’ll be 
stuck inside Chucky until his 
death. In fact, he’s gradually be­
coming more human inside the 
doll. His only hope is to put his 
soul into the first person that he 
revealed his true identity to. That
just happens to be his owner, 
Andy.
Child’s Play 2 revives this same 
basic plot, Chucky’s quest to pos­
sess Andy. Through- a question­
able plot twist, Chucky comes back 
to life to hunt Andy, who has been 
put into a home for emotionally 
disturbed children. After Andy is 
sent to a foster family, Chucky 
cleverly learns where Andy is and 
goes to find him, killing whomever 
dares to get in his way.
Brad Dourif reprises his role as 
the voice of Chucky. Dourif ap­
parently has found his true call­
ing as an actor. What better way 
to top off a career that boasts 
working opposite Jack Nicholson 
in One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s 
Nest than to become the voice of a 
demonic doll? Dourif is no stranger 
to slime. In Mississippi Burning 
he brilliantly played an under­
handed, racist deputy. Dourif also 
recently starred in another hor­
ror film, Stephen King’s Grave­
yard Shift, and Child’s Play 3 is 
already in production.
Dourifs sarcastic voice is per­
fect for Chucky. He’s downright 
scary as he baits his victim and 
laughs at each person’s downfall. 
Since Dourifs character makes 
the movie, his first-rate perfor­
mance saves the film.
Alex Vincent convincingly de­
picts Andy as a once-scared little 
boy whose fed-up with Chucky’s 
attitude. Andy knows he’s not 
crazy, that the doll really is kill­
ing people, and his frustration 
comes through strongly each time 
an adult tries to tell him he’s 
making his stories up.
Co-writer and director John 
Lafia keeps the plot interesting 
through this sequel. The movie 
rises above an average blood and 
gore film by having a cunning 
anti-hero with a ruthless and 
cynical attitude towards the 
world.
Child’s Play 2 may not scare you 
much, but it’s a fun movie in its, 
own right. Not always believable 
and never intellectual, this film 
can wear the label “entertaining.”

With Apple’s introduction of three new 
Macintosh® computers, meeting the challenges of college 
life just got a whole lot easier. Because now; everybody 
can afford a Macintosh.
Tlie our most
affordable model, yet it comes with everything you need- 
including a hard disk drive.The HBMBMIIM 
combines color capabilities with affordability. And the 
MffSfflBBillHI is perfect for students who need a 
computer with extra power and expandability.
No matter which Macintosh you choose, you’ll 
have a computer that lightens your work load without
giving you another tough subject to learn. Every Macintosh 
computer is easy to set up and even easier to master. And 
when you’ve learned one program, you’re well on your 
way to learning them all. That’s because thousands of avail­
able programs all work in the same, consistent manner. 
You can even share information with someone who uses a 
different type of computer—thanks to Apple’s versatile 
SuperDriveT which reads from and writes to Macintosh, 
MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple®ll floppy disks.
See the new Macintosh computers for yourself, 
and find out how surviving college just got a whole lot 
easier.

Sega fumbles with its latest game, Cyberball
Before I start this week’s re­
view, let me explain something. 
Of all the different types of games 
on the market, the arcade adapted 
games are the ones which I dis­
like the most.
The reason that I dislike them 
so much and rarely buy them is 
for the simple reason that these 
games are never as good as the 
arcade version. Trying to com­
pare a video game to its home 
•version is like comparing a Gen­
esis game to an Atari 2600 game. 
The home version just isn’t worth 
fifty bucks or so when I can go 
down to my nearby arcade and 
play a better version of the game 
for a quarter.
Now don’t get'me wrong. There 
have been some excellent arcade 
adaptations over the years —Ms. 
Pac Man for the Atari 2600, 
Beserker and Pac Man for the 
Atari 5200 — but those are few 
and far between. The latest addi­
tion to my list of disappointing 
adaptations is the Genesis ver­
sion of Cyberball.
For those of you who have never 
played Cyberball in the arcade the 
rules go something like this.
It’s the year 2022 and football, 
due to increasingly serious inju­
ries to the players and increas­
ingly ridiculous salary demands, 
has been changed forever. The 
combatants are no longer living, 
breathing humans, but robots. On 
top of that, the traditional pig­
skin has been replaced with a 
350-pound bomb which explodes 
at the end of the fourth down.
The rest of the game is pretty 
much the same as your standard 
American football game, just a lot 
more simplified. There are seVen 
robots per team, six periods per 
game, and three minutes per pe­
riod.
To get a down the offense has 
four plays to either move the ball
PRESS START
by Stephen Glicker
over the Ball Defuse Line (the 50- 
yard line) or to cross the 
opponent’s Goal Line. If the of­
fense can do neither, the ball will 
explode and the other team takes 
possession.
Like American football, each 
team has its own different types 
of players with their own special 
functions. Your offensive line 
consists of a quarterback, a run­
ning back, a wide receiver, a tight 
end, and three linemen. Your de­
fensive line consists of three line­
men, and various linebackers, 
cornerbacks, and safeties.
Finally, when it comes to plays 
themselves, Cyberball does get a 
few good marks. There are a total 
of 103 offensive formations, and 
before each play, there will be 
four running, pass, or option 
(mixture of running and passing) 
formations available to you. The 
ones that appear are the ones 
which are most effective given 
your present situation (field posi­
tion, ball status, etc.). And when 
you are on defense there are 12 
different types of formations 
available to you—short, medium, 
and long—that prove fairly effec­
tive against the offense.
Now I can get into the game 
itself and all of its problems. You 
basically have two main goals in 
Cyberball — to win as much 
money as possible (which in turn 
allows you to buy more expensive 
and better players), and win as 
many games as possible and
eventually make it to the Cyber 
Bowl to win the championship.
When it comes to money, you 
really won’t have a problem. Just 
about every little thing will re­
ward you with some money 
($15,000 per touchdown, $10,000 
per interception, $2,500 per con­
version block, etc.). This money 
does come in handy because your 
old players will constantly be ex­
ploding and breaking down. In 
addition, some of these new, 
faster, and more powerful players 
will be essential later on.
Looking back, Cyberball wasn’t 
really all that great of a game in 
the arcade. Sure, it was sort of 
original, but the graphics were 
far from spectacular, and the 
sound effects were pretty dull. It 
was only the fast and furious ac­
tion which really made this game 
playable. In Sega’s home version, 
not only have they somehow made 
the dull graphics and sound effects 
even worse, but they’ve killed the 
only thing this game had going 
for it — its gameplay.
The action on the field is still 
fairly fast and furious, which is a 
plus, but it’s the waiting around 
between plays which makes this 
game unbearable. After every 
single play you have to wait about 
two or three seconds before the 
screen switches from the playing 
field to the play options.
I know that two or three seconds 
might not seem like a long time, 
but after putting up with this two 
or three hundred times, and espe­
cially when you know in less than 
half a second exactly what play 
you wish to carry out, it really 
does become tedious and slows 
down the entire game.
Another major problem is 
whenever you do something, like 
score a touchdown, intercept the 
ball, or fumble, or the ball ex­
plodes, a huge sign appears smack
dab in the middle of the screen to 
tell you this, usually blocking the 
action. I have yet to see a player 
explode because the stupid “ball 
exploded” sign keeps appearing 
over the detonation.
Another major problem as that 
the television screen simply isn’t 
big enough. Half the time my
©1990 Sega of America, Inc.
players are somewhere off the top 
of the screen and I have to blindly 
pass the ball, hoping that it gets 
to them. Sega should have just 
made the players and the field a 
little smaller so that most of them 
could fit onto your television 
screen.
The graphics are flat and life­
less, making the game appear^ 
two-dimensional, as opposed to 
the three-dimensional effect th^ 
were trying to imitate. The sou^ 
effects consist mostly of a't}J]| 
throbbing which gets faster and 
slower throughout the game.
In matter of fact, the only 
thing I can say about this gaiiieis 
the two-player mode that is a 
of fun and well done, even if it too 
is a bit slow.
It’s really a shame that 5 
which has been planning to put 
out Cyberball for over a year and 
a half now, had to mess this gaift 
up so badly. One would think’tHal 
with all that time Sega wotf 
have at least put out a somewliai 
decent cartridge, as opposetTio 
this so-called game.
All in all, I strongly recommend 
that you skip over Cyberball and 
just wait until either Joe Mon- 
tana Football or John Maddei 
Football is released within thi 
next few weeks.
For the final evaluation, on a 
scale of one to ten, I give the 
graphics a three, the sound and 
special effects a three, anft'tfc 
playability a four. Overall, Tpj 
Cyberball a three. J ,nHi!
By the way, if anyone out 
has a game they wish me toVe- 
view, or would like to trade some 
games with me, or has any com­
ments about my column, by all 
means, send me some e-mail or 
drop me a note at The Tartan 
office.
Tune in next week when I 
review something new 
different, ard something 
nitely better than Cyberball.
Because Cyberball was such 
terrible game, Tartan 
Editor Stephen Glicker 
managed to stop playing ¡uj$$

David Eddings fails 
ô break new ground
with The Ruby Knight
«MIGHT, from page L13
.pell will end, and Ehlana will 
•0]]0w her protectors into death. 
Throughout the first two books 
Df series, ghosts of the dead 
ghts periodically appear to the 
,0mpany to hand over their bur- 
¡en, in the form of their ceremo- 
lial swords, to Sephrenia — a 
hilling reminder that time is 
lipping past.
During their travels, our he- 
oesand, heroines have various 
¿cl'sundry adventures, includ- 
cleansing a castle of the in- 
luence of an evil god and dabbling 
little in the art of raising the 
lead.
One of the main problems with 
jis work is that few of the char­
ters have been developed with 
nough individuality to be distin- 
uishable from one another. It 
eems that Eddings’ style is to 
irst come up with a bit of witty 
epartee, and then pick two char­
ters out of a hat to use it on. 
The plot is also pretty predict- 
jble. After overcoming various 
hallenges and obstacles, the good 
uys win. What more could you 
skfor? .
What’s most frustrating about
this book, though, is that you know 
that the company will find the 
magical jewel — yet Eddings 
keeps us hanging on and on as 
Sparhawk and his companions 
meet with petty obstacle upon 
obstacle. The company runs from 
grave to grave in search of the 
buried jewel for most of the book 
— only to be foiled when someone 
else finally gets there ahead of 
them and snatches it up.
Not to worry, though. The com­
pany eventually regains the jewel, 
accompanie d by a plot twist which 
may surprise some readers — 
although probably not the atten­
tive ones.
Eddings does throw in some 
battle scenes alongthe way, which 
also tend to be a little tiresome 
because there’s never any doubt 
that Sparhawk et al will emerge 
triumphant. Most of their battles 
are fought against mindless hu­
mans controlled by a creature 
called the Seeker, and it just seems 
to be a rather bloodthirsty excur­
sion into hack-and-slaughter.
Don’t get me wrong, though. I 
enjoyed reading The Ruby Knight 
(and I must admit that I sacri­
ficed quite a few hours of school-
Antigone to open
work to do it). The novel is incred­
ibly absorbing and amusing. 
Eddings’ sense of humor is lively, 
and his dialogue is hysterical. It’s 
one of those books that you’ll hate 
to love — but you’ll probably do it 
anyway.
Readers of Eddings’ Belgariad 
series will probably feel more than 
a little deja vu here. Many of the 
characters in The Elenium bear 
uncanny resemblance to charac-
Keith Parkinson/©1991 Ballantine Books 
ters in that series — and what’s 
more, so does the plot. Fortunately 
though, The Elenium will run its 
course in only three books, not 
five, as in the Belgariad (and five 
more in The Belgariad’s sequel 
series, The Malloreon). The Dia­
mond Throne began the series, 
and The Sapphire Rose will con­
clude it, in a way which its pub­
lishers say will be “surprising.” 
But I doubt it.
By TERRI KASCH
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Director Yossi Yzraely brings 
the highly emotional drama 
Antigone to Kresge; the show 
previews this Tursday and opens 
Saturday night.
Antigone is the third and final 
Theban play by Sophocles. This 
trilogy follows the lives of the in­
famous King Oedipus and his 
family.
Long before the play Antigone 
begins, many horrifying events 
unfold. The Oracle at Delphi tells 
young Oedipus that he will mur­
der his father and marry his own 
mother. Sickened by this thought, 
he places himself in voluntary 
exile, leaving his hometown of 
Corinth and the couple that he 
thinks are his parents behind. 
From there he travels to Thebes 
where he accidentally kills an old 
man, and then marries his widow.
And so, the basis of Freudian 
psychology was born. Oedipus 
finds out that he has indeed ful­
filled the oracle’s prophesy and to 
atone for this, he blinds himself.
His two sons then battle for the 
throne of Thebes. Polyneices at­
tacks from Argos while his brother 
Eteocles defends Thebes inside 
the city walls. The two men end 
up killing each other in battle. 
This leaves Oedipus’ two daugh­
ters, Antigone and Ismene, as the
family’s last survivors. Creon, 
once a regent in Thebes, has taken 
the throne and declared that 
Polyneices will not be buried. In­
stead, according to Creon’s or­
ders, the body will he out each 
day, guarded by sentries, to rot 
and be picked at by scavenging 
animals. Eteocles receives a 
proper burial because he tried to 
defend Thebes, but Polyneices 
attacked the city, in Creon’s mind 
an unforgivable sin.
This is the pointwhere Antigone 
begins. The title character and 
her sister must decide whether to 
obey Creon’s law or risk a tortu­
ous death by burying Polyneices.
Lisa Mathis takes on the title 
role in the Kresge production of 
the play. She is joined by Sharon 
Rosen as her sister Ismene and 
Greg Stuhr as the dictatorial 
Creon. W. Ellis porter, in his final 
Kresge performance, will play the 
chorus, a one person representa­
tion of the Theban masses.
Although the plot of this trilogy 
may seem far-fetched or contrived, 
the dialogue at times stiff and 
melodramatic, the fundamental 
and timeless pain of overwhelm­
ing tragedy resides in Sophocles’ 
works. These plays, now ap­
proximately three thousand years 
old, still have the freshness and 
truth of a newly written work.
Antigone will run from Nov. 15 
to Dec. 8. Call x2407 for info.

move toward pop drivel.
In the case of Kate and Anna 
McGarrigle, their new album 
Heartbeats Accelerating shows 
that these sisters from Montréal 
have opted to cross the tightrope 
to pop instrumentalism and then 
cross back to their folk roots, 
bringing with them a streamlined, 
modem studio sound. Working 
with new record company Private 
Music (known primarily for new- 
age musicians such as Yanni and 
Patrick O’Hearn with a mix of 
folk artists, i.e. Leo Kottke) and 
new producer Pierre Marchand, 
the McGarrigles blend a basic 
guitar-and-voice base with subtle 
synthesizer parts, mild overdubs, 
and the smoothness of the studio
— all without losing the edgy, 
artsy gruffness of genuine folk 
music.
While Heartbeats is the 
McGarrigles’ fifth English-lan­
guage album (an additional record 
of French songs is available on 
the Hannibal Records label, ap­
propriately entitled The French 
Album), the fourth album, Love 
Over And Over, was released over 
seven years ago. The changing 
face of popular music led the duo 
to choose Marchand, whose cred­
its include work with Daniel 
Lanois and the Neville Brothers, 
as the new album’s producer, 
primarily with the aim that he 
enhance the music without overtly 
changing it.
Enhance he has. Heartbeats is 
enticing and delicate by turns, 
ranging from the cynical walk­
ing-bass ditty Hit And Run Love 
to the bouncy, raw Rainbow Ride. 
The McGarrigle sisters both have 
the kind of voice suited to camp­
fire harmonies and smoky clubs, 
and they almost collapse into 
lovely duets without strain or dis­
comfiture. At the same time, the 
voices are underproduced to the 
point that they pull the light 
melodies and biting lyrics into 
sharp focus. These women sing 
for real, and Marchand’s produc­
tion ensures that they sound real
all the way to the CD player.
The sisters have a distinct dif­
ference in songwriting styles. Al­
though several songs are co-cred- 
ited, those with Anna’s solo sig­
nature tend to be a bit more up­
beat and optimistic, like the 
balladic title track. Kate is the
more prolific sister as a solo writer, 
and oddly enough her songs tend 
to be more downbeat and solemn, 
especially in the case of the mo­
notonous and exquisitely sad I Eat 
Dinner and also in Mother 
Mother, a drum-driven prayer of 
fear that could easily fit in with
Kate Bush or The Wall.
Overall, Heartbeats Accelerat­
ing is a marvelous introduction to 
the McGarrigles’ music for first­
time listeners, and a very strong 
advance forward for one of 
Canada’s consistently excellent 
folk duos.

L16The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 12 November 1990
The Bradys are back — and this time it’s in print
BRADYS, from page L13
found in Pittsburgh weekdays at 
1:30 pm on channel 53). But the 
Bunch is far from dead. They have 
been featured in a cartoon (The 
Brady Kids), a variety show (The 
Brady Bunch Hour), an updated 
sitcom (The Brady Brides), a 
couple of TV movies {The Brady 
Girls Get Married and A Very 
Brady Christmas) and last year’s 
horrible attempt at “dramedy” 
(The Bradys).
With a legacy like that, it seems 
only natural that someone some­
where should write a book about 
the Bunch. Someone did — actu­
ally, two someones: Andrew J. 
Edelstein and Frank Lovece — 
and they have succeeded in cap­
turing the essence of The Brady 
Bunch.
Edelstein and Lovece begin with 
the assumption that this family 
is not one that should be taken
seriously. This tongue-in-cheek 
attitude is what makes the book 
so enjoyable — no one, even the 
creator Sherwood Schwartz, 
claims that the Bradys is “fine 
art” or even “good TV.”
We watch it to laugh at the 
stupid seventies styles and the 
horrible naivete present in every 
character — and, to a certain ex­
tent, although we might not like 
to admit it, we watch it for its 
nostalgic value, as a memory of 
childhood.
This book contains just about 
everything a normal human 
would ever want to know about 
the Bradys. There are 43 differ­
ent sections, including a detailed 
description of how The Brady 
Bunch came to be. Here we read 
about the infamous double bed 
(Mike and Carol were the first TV 
parents to actually sleep to­
gether), the Tiger tragedy (the
This book contains just about every­
thing a normal human would ever 
want to know about the Bradys.
original Tiger died and made a 
quiet exit from the show) and 
Carol’s divorce (that’s right, no 
one ever said that she was a 
widow, although it was automati­
cally assumed).
Next we get to Meet the Brady 
Bunch, where we are reminded of 
each character’s unique person­
ality traits. Included: “Lessons 
from Mike” (“We always have to 
have rules and laws, but we have 
to use them with reason and jus­
tice”) and “Advice from Carol” (“If 
you carry a joke too far, somebody 
could get hurt”), not to mention 
“The Many Loves of Marcia
Brady” and “Pickup Tips from 
Greg Brady.”
Other sections include brief bi­
ographies and filmographies of 
the cast members. And a week- 
by-week guide to every Brady 
Bunch episode makes it easy for 
us to go back and pick out our 
favorite episodes (like #69, “Ser­
geant Emma,” in which tilted 
camera angles and military mu­
sic played on one of those unique 
seventies instruments made for 
one of the most surreal Brady 
moments ever).
The middle section of the book 
is called Brady Miscellanea, a
potpourri of “stuff’ which puts a 
Brady twist on things like pizza, 
music, groovy language, dates, 
teachers, sexual politics, celeb­
rity athletes, Gilligan’s Island, 
pets, phone numbers, Raquel 
Welch, and much, much, much 
more.
The authors finally go off the 
deep end with a section on the 
“Lost Episodes” of The Brady 
Bunch, in which sagging ratings 
cause the Bradys to become so­
cially conscious. Cindy’s offered a 
marijuana joint, Marcia wants to 
live in a commune, Mike and Carol 
are separated, and Greg and 
Marcia finally elope. A hilarious 
way to end a wonderful book.
The Brady Bunch Book isn’t only 
for couch potatoes and self-pro­
claimed Brady aficionados; it’s for 
anyone who has ever watched an 
episode of The Brady Bunch. 
Whether you love or hate the
show, you will find something 
enjoyable in this book.
So why is this groovy and sexu- 
ally symmetric California farriily
still so dam popular? The
thors say it best in this 
from the beginning of the boojffa 
section entitled The Bradys in TV- 
Sitcom History):
It’s easy to understand why this 
new obsession with the Bradys is 
so bittersweet. Beneath our 
laughter is a slight yearning for 
the kind of family life many of us 
wish we’d had. We may have worn 
the plaid bell-bottoms, same as 
Greg and Marcia, but most of.us 
didn’t have a live-in housekeeper 
financial luxury, or — most 'im­
portant of all — those open and 
sympathetic lines of communica­
tion.
Still, they really acted like white- 
bread dorks most of the time, didn’t 
they?

GENERAL, from page L13
with him, nor are comfortable 
with his threatening presence.
Accompanying Bolivar, among 
soldiers sent by the government 
to ensure that he leaves the coun­
try, are his close and compassion­
ate followers: apostle-like gener­
als who fought in glorious military 
campaigns with, and now for, their 
savior. Also along is José Palacios, 
who serves his master without 
fault, both as a servant and as a 
mental and emotional crutch.
Surrounding the entourage is a 
country whose state parallels that 
of the General’s health. The citi­
zens have lost their respect for a 
man who was once a loved hero. 
Walls are scrawled with angry 
slurs against Bolivar, and gossip 
about everything from the 
General’s journey to his sexual
exploits rush about faster than 
the the torrential floods that 
plague the country.
Indeed, everyone feels that they 
have figured Bolivar out, and they 
have grown bored of what they 
feel to be, and in some physical 
respects is, a hollow shell of a 
man. But ironically, these are the 
same feelings that the General 
has for the country.
But when hopes for a united 
continent once again appear, the 
genius that is Bolivar burns 
through what by now is an over­
spent and prem aturely aged body, 
in a final attempt to secure his 
dream. His mind, despite his ef­
forts, is the only thing that re­
mains intact, however, and even 
this relents under the strain of 
sickness.
This is no longer the Bolivar of
Thomas Woodruff/©1990 Alfred A. Knopf
the romantic days of the libera­
tion — the strong, young man 
who covered more miles on 
horseback than possibly anybody 
else, the man whose relations with 
the ladies were as successful and
satisfying as his relationship with 
Lady Luck, the man who once 
heard his name in song as he 
entered the cities of jubilant and 
loving citizens. And as the days 
progress, the General’s health, 
and the state of the newly formed 
government, disintegrate.
The General in His Labyrinth 
could equally be called The 
Reader and the General in His 
Labyrinth, to the credit of 
Márquez. He is a master of words, 
enveloping the reader in the worn 
mind of a once great military and 
political legend, taking one 
through the General’s labyrin­
thine thoughts and memories.
This novel is classic Márquez, 
who, through the translation of 
Edith Grossman, uses meticulous 
and precise care touching the 
senses of an engrossed reader.
Indeed, upon encountering any 
passage dealing with food, the 
reader should not be surprised to 
feel hunger, or even almost taste 
what has been poignantly de­
scribed. The way Márquez famil­
iarizes the reader with Bolivar’s 
mind through the beautiful nar­
ration is equally successful in 
expressing the other characters 
through their dialogue.
This story by itself is about as 
exciting as a history lesson could 
get. It is only saved throij»] 
Marquez’s wonderful fictiona 
account of the General’s last day« 
There are few authors who coillc 
take this bit of history and satisfy 
the reader as well as Marque: 
has. The General in His Laby­
rinth is a novel that is as oufe 
standing as the General himself,

ORCHESTRATING DESIGN SOLUTIONS
JAM SESSION
Tam TntfrvfpwsOn-Campus Jam Session
December 4, 1990
In 1782, in the court of Emperor Joseph II, a brash 
young composer named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 
set the music world on its ear. A radical departure 
from the current fashion in music, he set a new 
standard for style and composition.
It has always been so—the old guard surpassed by 
a new wave. Today, Cadence is breaking with the 
conventional order as we pioneer a new way of 
designing the next generation of electronic prod­
ucts. It's called Electronic Product Development 
Automation (EPDA) and, led by Cadence, it’s the 
direction the industry is heading. Automation on a 
task by task basis was good enough for the last 
decade; the 1990s call for automation beyond that 
level. Designers need a process that encompasses 
the total product development cycle.
EPDA represents Cadence's vision of how product 
design needs to be done in the 1990s. We're 
already an established leader in supplying what 
designers need at the Electronic Design Automation 
(EDA) stage of product development thanks to our 
pioneering Design Framework 11™ architecture and 
the high-performance suite of tools based on that 
integrated system. Our aim for the coming decade 
is to leverage our proven EDA technology to offer a 
complete, integrated EPDA solution.
But EPDA is more than just a technological vision. 
Cadence’s long-standing philosophies of openness, 
software portability, support of industry standards,

and cooperation with other technology innovators 
also play a key role in our drive toward providing a 
total solution and set ours apart from traditional 
approaches.
What all this means for you is the opportunity to 
join the vanguard of design automation. You can 
begin contributing your ideas from day one. as you 
participate in a creative process infused with intel­
ligence, enthusiasm, and personal commitment.

A Taxing Woman’s Return
Japanese film master Juzo Itami gives us this 
sequel to his 1987 hit A Taxing 'Woman. In A Taxing 
'Woman’s Return, the heroic tax inspector Ryoko 
Itakura (played by Itami’s wife Nobuko Miyamoto) 
teams up with inspector Mishima, a recent graduate 
of Tokyo University. As they investigate a corrupt 
religious organization, the pair encounter a host of 
evil-doers, including the adulterous leader Chief 
Elder Teppei Onizawa. As Ryoko and a crew of other 
inspectors try to trap the principal offenders, the 
film winds around complex and intriguing paths 
until the case is closed.
This Thursday, go over to DH2210 and welcome 
the Taxing Woman back.

Fast Times At 
Ridgemont High
The ultimate teenage movie. Forget about John 
Hughes and his complex little stories. Fast Times At 
Ridgemont High is nothing but pure fun.
Everyone at Ridgemont is having some problems. 
Sean Penn is the surfer dude who is failing history. 
His wise-ass remarks get him nowhere with his 
stick-up-the-butt teacher. Jennifer Jason Leigh is 
the confused teenage girl who feels virginity is 
unimportant. She scares away her beloved biology 
lab partner with her sexual standpoint. Judge 
Reinhold is Leigh’s brother — the boy who had 
everything until he lost his job and his girlfriend. He 
spends too much of his time in the bathroom fan­
tasizing about his sister’s gorgeous best friend, 
Phoebe Cates.
In the midst of all the problems are typical high 
school car races, talk about sex, beer, and parties, 
and sex. What can go wrong with such a simple plot?
Don’t be stingy with your money this week. There 
are too many laughs and too many great Sean Penn- 
before-his-attitude moments to take in. Don’t miss 
it.

Saturday, November 17Miami Blues
Alec Baldwin {The Hunt for Red October) gives an 
outstanding performance as a con man in this dark 
and suspenseful movie written by George Armitage. 
Baldwin manifests his brutality early in the movie, 
but over the course of the plot we come to see that he 
also has a loving side. Jennifer Jason Leigh co-stars 
as the hooker paying her way through college who 
wins Baldwin’s devotion even as he steals her money, 
and Fred Ward plays the gruff cop who sets out to 
catch Baldwin. Before the final conflict, Armitage 
throws some twists into the normal love-and-money 
fare — Baldwin writes haiku, Ward loses his false 
teeth, and all three characters share dinner. Although 
this film has some graphic scenes, don’t let them 
stop you — it’s a masterful psychological portrait, 
well worth the dollar.

The Man Who Shot 
Liberty Valance
No ordinary western, The Man Who Shot Liberty 
Valance was John Ford’s bittersweet farewell to the 
Western, and it stars a most unusual combination of 
actors — Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne. Stewart 
portrays a young and somewhat idealistic lawyer, 
trying to civilize an untamed town through the legal 
system. Wayne is his usual roughneck self— a man 
who knows what it takes to survive in the West. But 
trouble starts when Stewart rubs Liberty Valance, 
the town brute, the wrong way. Stewart is forced to 
Put his ideals and pick up a pistol, and Wayne is 
there every step of the way to look out for the man 
who shot Liberty Valance.
Ford’s visual sense and belief in sparse dialogue, 
as well as some excellent acting, make this film a 
definite “must see.”
