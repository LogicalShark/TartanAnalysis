Fraternity Rush Opens Friday With House Tours
Freshmen will get their first 
opportunity to visit CMU’s 
twelve fraternities at the Coun­
cil of Fraternity Presidents’ 
rush tours Friday, September 29 
and Sunday, October 1.
The tours, scheduled for 6:- 
30 to 10:00 Friday and 12:30 
to 4:00 Sunday, are open to 
all interested freshmen and 
upperclassmen. Rushees will 
meet in the Skibo ballroom 
and divide into twelve groups, 
each conducted by a CFP rep­
resentative.
Freshmen should attend 
both tours if they wish to see 
all twelve houses. Each group 
will visit six houses on the 
first tour and the remaining 
six houses on Sunday. Appro­
priate dress for the occasion is 
coat and tie.
“Rush” refers to the time in 
which freshmen can investigate 
the fraternity system to decide 
whether they are interested in 
pledging, that is, joining one of 
CMU’s chapters. Although for­
mal rush doesn’t begin until 
early in the second semester, 
CFP has set up a schedule of 
events for the fall semester to 
enable new students to find 
out what the system has to offer 
and what the advantages of 
fraternity membership are.
Besides the rush tours this 
week, the fall rush schedule in­
cludes an informal lunch on 
October 12 from 11:30 to 1:30, 
smokers from 7:30 to 10:00 on 
October 27 and December 15, 
and a party on November 17 
from 8:30 to 1:00. Dress for all 
events except the final smoker 
is informal. Appropriate dress 
for the December 15 smoker is 
coat and tie. Smokers provide 
an informal atmosphere in 
which rushees can meet frater­
nity members and ask questions 
about the operation and special 
characteristics of the houses 
they visit.
Although rushees can bring 
dates to the party, they are en­
couraged to come alone as well.
To insure that fall rusli is 
conducted fairly, CFP has es­
tablished a set of rules which 
are printed below. The rules 
apply to freshmen only; up­
perclassmen may rush openly 
at any time.
1) Rushees may contact a 
fraternity man at any time.
2) A rushee is permitted in a 
fraternity house only during 
scheduled rush events or dur­
ing a meeting of a club recog­
nized by Student Congress. At 
such a meeting there will be no rushing.
3) A rushee is not permitted 
in an apartment associated with a fraternity man.
4) Quiet hours will prevail 
in tiie dorms only from 7:00 p. 
rn. until 8:30 a.m. each school 
n:ght. Quiet hours means a fra­
ternity man shall not take the 
iniative in discussing fraternity 
affairs, although other personal 
contact is all right.
5) Fraternity men are pro­
hibited from giving rushees any­
thing of monetary value. Loan­
ing them motor vehicles is 
against rush rules, but giving 
them rides is not.
6) Fraternity men cannot of­
fer rushees alcoholic beverages 
at anytime—in or out of a fra­
ternity house.
7) No alcoholic beverages 
may be served at any scheduled 
rush event.
8) No oral or written bids 
(invitations to join a fraternity) 
may be given before the start 
of the formal rush second se­
mester. Bids cannot be accepted 
until the first day of pledging.
9) First year transfer stu­
dents may be rushed as upper­
classmen.
10) Invitations to rush 
events may be sent by individual 
houses anytime after the rush 
tours.
11) Further interpretation of 
rush rules will be made by Bob 
Harbage, C.F.P. President, at 
681-0124. Freshmen are encour­
aged to report any infractions 
of rush rules.
Freshmen taking part in rush 
should divide their initial at­
tention equally among the 
twelve houses. Later, when they 
have an idea of what each 
house has to offer, they can con­
centrate on a few houses. Fra­
ternities want new members to 
join with full knowledge as to 
what to expect as a member, so 
iushees should ask questions 
and find out as much as possible 
about the houses of their inter­
est. Above all rushees are en­
couraged to be open-minded, to 
do their own thinking so that 
they will make a decision which 
is best for themselves.
Panelists To Speak on Law Enforcement
Justice Michael A. Musmanno, 
Thomas M. Kerr, and Eugene L. 
Coon will be the panelists in a 
forum discussion on “The Im­
pact of the Recent Supreme 
Court Decisions on Law En­
forcement.”
In the first in a series of pub­
lic service programs to be spon­
sored by the American-Hellenic 
Educational and Progressive As­
sociation (AHEPA), the discus­
sion will be held on Sunday, Oct.
1, at 8 pm in the Carnegie Lec­
ture Hall.
It will bring together Mr. 
Kerr, the outspoken local chair­
man of the American Civil Lib­
erties Unions, and Mr. Coon, 
the assistant superintendent of 
Pittsburgh Police, who recently 
had a rather heated public dis­
agreement on police methods 
used in the interrogation of the 
alleged “Commuter Bandit.” 
Joining them will be Justice 
Musmanno, who is rumored to 
be seeking the Democratic nom­
ination for the Senate seat now 
held by Senator Joseph Clark. 
Justice Musmanno is known as 
one of the most dramatic speak­
ers this side of Everret Dirksen.
All three members of the pan­
el have publicly expressed their 
attitudes on the impact of the 
recent Supreme Court judg­
ments on police methods and op­
erations. Some fur promises to 
fly when they all appear on the 
same public platform. The gen­
eral public is invited to attend; 
no admission will be charged.
Mr. Kerr is the acting head 
of the Administration and Man­
agement Science Department.
' ; 67 Ray Charles
Parades, booths, football con­
certs, dancing, and beautiful 
girls will be the highlights of 
Homecoming 1967 to be held on 
campus the weekend of Oct. 20.

is “Sights and Sounds of the 
Sixties,” and men will work long 
hours on booths while women 
will be competing for the covet­
ed Campus Queen title. Home­
coming is officially opened Fri­

and roll and jazz performers in 
a campus-wide ballot. Appear­
ing with Ray Charles will be the 
Kaeletts, a female singing group, 
singer - pianist Billy Preston, 
dancer Chelsea Brown, and the 
Fay Charles orchestra.
On Saturday, after the parade
• • •
of Queen candidates around the 
football field, the Tartans will 
meet Franklin and Marshall in 
the traditional Homecoming 
football game. A victory dance 
will be held regardless of the 
game outcome. Saturday night 
swings with Gary Glenn and the 
Jeweltones in the Ballroom while 
Pat Oliver will entertain the 
more sedate in the Faculty 
Lounge.
Questions and suggestions are 
invited and welcomed by this 
year’s Homecoming Committee: 
Mike Smolens, chairman; Mur­
ray Dickman, vice-chairman in 
charge of entertainment; Rich 
Steffens, treasurer; Bill Benthall, 
tickets; Bob Albertson, publici­
ty; John Zabetakis, displays; 
P.andee Rafkin, Queens; Jim 
Jacks, judging; Ruth Steiger, 
Pan-Hel representative; and Lau­
ra Seidler, design and printing.
Test Dates Set for Teaching Exam
College seniors preparing to 
teach school may take the Na­
tional Teacher Examinations on 
any of the three different test 
dates announced by Educational 
Testing Service, a non-profit ed­
ucational organization which 
prepares and administers this 
testing program.
New dates for the testing of 
prospective teachers are: Feb.
3, April 6, and July 6, 1968. The 
tests will be given at nearly 500 
locations throughout the United 
States, ETS said.
Results of the Sational Teach­
er Examinations are used by 
many large school districts as 
one of several factors in the se­
lection of new teachers and by 
several states for certification or 
licensing of teachers. Some 
colleges also require all seniors 
preparing to teach to take the 
examinations.
On each full day of testing, 
prospective teachers may take 
the Common Examinations, 
which measure the professional 
preparation and general cultur­
al background of teachers, and 
one of 13 Teaching Area Exam­
inations which measure mastery 
of the subject they expect to 
teach.
Prospective teachers should 
contact the school systems in 
which they seek employment, or 
their colleges, for specific advice 
on which examinations to take 
and on which dates they should 
be taken.
A bulletin of information con­
taining a list of test centers and 
information about the examina­
tions as well as a registration 
form may be obtained from col­
lege placement officers, school 
personnel departments, or di­
rectly from National Teacher 
Examinations, Box 911, Educa­
tional Testing Service, Prince­
ton, N. J. 08540.

L’ook, the complete campus tele­
phone directory. This year’s C- 
Book will be available in a few

Last year was a successful 
one for CJB, under the direction
o f leader - trombonist - arranger 
Shoup. In the Spring, the band 
compete at the Villanova In­
tercollegiate Jazz Festival at 
Villanova University near Phil­
adelphia. The band was also in­
vited to participate at the Ohio 
Collegiate Jazz Festival at Case 
Institute of Technology. The 
highlight of last year for the 
CJB was their appearance at the 
Three Rivers Arts Festival in 
Gateway Plaza, downtown.
This year, the band plans to 
be even more active. Current 
plans include a feature with the 
Kiltie Band during the Home­
coming football show, concerts 
on the campuses in the Pitts­
burgh area, and participation in 
at least one of the major inter­
collegiate jazz festivals. A short 
tour is also being contemplated 
for the Spring.
Any questions concerning the 
Concert Jazz Band should be di­
rected to Dick Shoup at 681- 
3676.

YM-YWCA Opens Film Series Season
Last Friday, the YM-YWCA 
Cine Series opened its film sea­
son with The Servant, a British 
psychological thriller starring 
Dirk Bogarde.
The films, highly international 
in character, represent six coun­
tries, and range from highly 
thought provokers (Ingmar- 
Bergman’s The Magician; Black 
Orpheus) and thrillers (Notor­
ious; The Third Man) to comed­
ies (Terry-Thomas’ School for 
Scoundrels,, Dracula).
The films are shown at 7:30 
and 10 pm on scheduled Fridays 
at Porter Hall 100. Admission is 
25 cents for members of the 
campus YM-YWCA and 75 cents 
for non-members. Copies oi the 
film schedule can be picked up 
at the film showing.
MORE THAN JUST A FUN COUPLE
U „ bk U «
TONY LAWRENCE
Very early in the film, Bonnie and Clyde, Faye Duneway and 
Warren Beatty tell Michael J. Pollard that “We rob banks—cause 
that’s what we do best.” And so Bonnie and Clyde are off on a 
robbing and killing spree that leaves 18 folks dead and numerous 
ones broke. At first glance Bonnie and Clyde would appear to be 
a run of the mill gangster film. Instead of taking the easy way 
out and making a simple commercial film, Producer Beatty and 
Director Arthur Penn have instead chosen to create a masterpiece 
by bringing to the screen some immensly well done and provoca­
tive character studies combined with superb photography and a 
remarkable score by Flatt and Scruggs,
When Bonnie meets Clyde he is thinking of stealing a car in 
front of her home after just being released from prison. She falls 
hard for him and joins up with him,after finding that he is impo­
tent, to seemingly improve his sexual represessions as well as 
increase their economic situation.
Their robberies and killings are clumsily executed and amaz­
ingly daring. They relentlessly get out of the most difficult situa­
tions. Also in the entourage are Clyde’s brother (Gene Hackman), 
his wife (Estelle Parsons), and Michael J. Pollard, who they pick­
ed up at a gas station as their driver. Together they bicker, listen 
to records, take pictures of each other incessantly, and eventually 
find their own fates. Hackman is killed; Estelle Parson is shot in 
the face and left blind. Michael J. Pollard is rewarded for turning 
in Bonnie and Clyde to the police, and they are led into a simple 
trap and themselves are exterminated in some dazzling footage.
In its own way—Bonnie and Clyde is unforgettable. The 
tremendous sense of the depression. The loneliness of the 
characters involved. The magnificent scene when Bonnie and 
Clyde arrange a meeting place so that Bonnie can see her 
family that she longs for and misses, done as sort of a mon­
tage with a devastating vague quality in the camera work.
The editing is crisp and nothing is unnecessary or wasteful. 
The car chases are short and to the point. Performances by all 
of the actors are excellent. Even Beatty, who often does weird 
things on screen, comes off very well. Faye Duneway, aside from 
being beautiful, shows much promise and obviously understood 
Bonnie. Estelle Parsons and Gene Hackman used much subtlety 
in their performances and at the same time employed force where 
it was needed. Michael J. Pollard, who has one of the great screen 
faces in probably the last 20 years, contributes with his many 
talents. After seeing him in drab comedy roles (The Russians Are 
Coming, Enter Laughing) he fits beautifully into the film.
This labor of love by Beatty and Penn is well worth seeing. 
But only if you are ready for it.
New Films to Debut 
At Undergrounds
The Experimental Film Group 
of Carnegie - Mellon University 
will presents its first program 
of Underground and Experimen­
tal Films Wednesday, Oct. 4, at 
Skibo Ballroom. This year’s 
Series of Underground Films 
Will debut with a showing of thg 
latest and most important of the 
new American Film-maker.
Heading the program will be 
Kenneth Anger’s “Kustom Kar 
Kommandos.” Anger, creator of 
“Fireworks,” perhaps the most 
famous and controversial Under­
ground Film of them all, per- 
sues a similar theme in “Kom- 
mandos,” in continuing his study 
of the sexual fanaticism and in­
version of the American male.
Co-featured on the program 
will be Bruce Conner’s “Break­
away.” A film very much sim­
ilar to his earlier “Cosmic Ray,” 
this study of the nude female 
form in motion has been widely 
acclaimed. John Hofmess, per­
haps the most important young 
film-maker to appear since Con­
ner, will be represented by the 
first United States showing of 
“Redpath 25.”
Also to be included on the 
program will be “Dodge City,” 
by Jeff Dell, winner of the Sec­
ond Prize at the Expo ’67 Film 
Festival. The late Steve Kagan,
Scholars’Community To Begin in Oakland
An unusual experiment in

also been a consultant in poe­
try at the Library of Congress

of Pittsburgh’s Henry Clay 
Frick Fine Arts Building for a 
public art exhibition when it be­
gan to show the work of 28 
20th-century masters there Sep­

new discussion program, “Col­
lege Forum,” on Sunday, Oct.
1, at 8 pm.
The hour long show, moder­
ated by WTAE’s Hank Baugh­
man, is on the air every Sunday 
night with a panel from one of 
the four universities in Pitts­
burgh. This week, CMU is repre­
sented by Dale Peshell, Student 
Congress president; Alan Witch- 
ner, Men’s Dorm Council presi­
dent; and Bob Shulman, who 
will discuss the topic of “Liquor 
Control Laws and Social Free­
dom.” They will answer ques­
tions and the audience is invited 
to call in their questions. The 
number to call is 242-5922.
Students interested in partici- 
pting on future panels should 
volunteer to either one of the 
present panelists.
Metals Club Topic- 
Auto-Air Pollution
The first meeting of the Met­
als Club will be Thursday, Sept. 
28, at 7:30 pm at the Alpha Tau 
Omega fraternity house, comer 
of Forbes and Morewood. Prof. 
Gouse of the Mechanical Engi­
neering Department will speak 
about “Automobile Propulsion: 
Hot Air, Steam and the Future” 
and wifi consider the problem 
of automobile air pollution and 
the possible solutions. A social 
hour with refreshments will fol­
low the program.
The Metals Club provides an 
opportunity for an exchange of 
ideas among faculty and stu­
dents in the Metallurgy and 
Material Science Department 
that broadens and transcends 
their professional interests. It 
offers an occasion to acquaint 
the students with the multi­
faceted role of the metallurgist 
in both the academic and in­
dustrial world. Throughout the 
academic year, varied programs 
are organized which are aimed 
at all levels of the student pop­
ulation^
All interested students and 
faculty are welcome and a cor­
dial invitation is extended to all 
freshmen,
one, etc.
This is the name of a new University/Men’s Shop. A Unique name. A masculine name. 
A very distinguished name, yet young in spirit. It has to be. It reflects the clothing we sell.

EDITORIAL
Fire, Two
Last week, the Tartan pre­
sented its views on the state of 
fire prevention here at CMU. 
This week, we should like to 
analyze possible student contri­
butions—good and bad—to the 
existing situation.
Positive contributions from 
dorm residents seem to be min­
imal. In the men’s living quar­
ter’s, especially older hill dorms, 
the inhabitants persist in bring­
ing in hotplates, coffee makers, 
and other electrical appliances 
which are forbidden by Men’s 
Dorm Council rules. (One fel­
low’s desire for a hot lasagna 
sandwich at three am, and his 
subsequent use of his illegal 
hotplate, could result in the 
deaths of more than several of 
his friends.)
Then, there is the nature of 
the inhabitants. They are as 
neat as can be expected, but 
many have created fire traps 
in their rooms by incautious 
storage of bedding and cloth­
ing articles.
Many of the dorm residents 
also smoke heavily. With late 
study hours and a tendency to 
become lax in the direction of 
the ashes and butts, there is 
always the danger of an “acci­
dental” blaze. Lastly, there are 
always the problems of the 
“practical” joker, who sets an­
noying wastebasket fires which 
could bring the entire dorm to 
the ground.
The same can generally be 
said of Morewood Gardens. But 
in addition to the general prob­
lems of smoking and storage, 
women’s dorms contain an im­
posing amount of flammable and 
explosive material. There is 
hair spray, setting gel, more 
hair spray, pressurized perfume, 
hair coloring, even more hair 
spray, etc. The array is both 
magnificent and deadly.
In addition, the women are 
more inclined to use irons in a 
hurry and may not always shut 
them off properly; and often 
use irons which are in poor con­
dition.
In Morewood the fire mar­
shals are in general obeyed, but 
their authority is not as definite 
as it should be. The same goes 
for fire regulations in general: 
they are tolerated, rather than 
obeyed
Thus, from this overview, and 
especially with our view of the 
women’s dorms carried over 
from last week, we have several 
suggestions.
First, it is every student’s job 
to follow the fire regulations as 
published in his handbook or 
dorm guide.
Second, the administration, 
with all possible speed, should 
see to the adequate training and 
equipping of fire marshals for 
Morewood Gardens and the 
men’s dorms.
Third, the student body should 
be together in a necessary series 
of instruction periods. In this 
way the administration will dis­
charge its duty to educate us 
as to the general, as well as the 
specific, nature of the problems 
we face.
Fourth, Dale Peschel, Pres­
ident of Student Government, 
should appoint a committee at 
the next session of Student Sen­
ate which would be charged with 
keeping this a live issue until 
all of the regulations are follow­
ed and all administration duties 
are carried out.
Fifth, the members of the 
senate should return to their 
constituencies and aid the floor 
counselors and fire marshals in 
maintaining regulations.
Arid last in relation to our 
second point, the administration 
should show the student body, 
by its actions, that it is proceed­
ing with an integrated fire pre­
vention and training program, 
as well as carrying out the sug­
gestions in last week’s Tartan.
If the above is done, we feel 
that the campus will be fairly 
well prepared with respect to 
fire prevention, but this will 
have to be a joint effort. The 
student body must understand 
and carry out its obligations.
Otherwise, an awful lot of 
people may get burned up.
Letter to the Editor
Draft Law
Editor, the TARTAN
Last June 30 marked the ex­
piration of the old Selective Ser­
vice Law. The event had been 
anticipated by studies of the in­
equities of the system and some 
recommendations for improve­
ment. Major proposals were to 
curtail college student defer­
ments, to install alottery system 
in place of the separate arbitary 
and varying whims of 4,000 local 
draft boards, and to draft young­
er men — 19 year olds.
None of these things were 
done.
The college undergraduate de­
ferment was continued, strength­
ened so that it is available to all 
students “satisfactorily pursuing 
a full-time course.” The local 
boards were retained intact, 
varying standards and all. The 
yourigest-first proposal was al­
lowed, but then the President 
chose not to use it, at least not 
right away.
It will be easier to obtain and 
retain college undergraduate de­
ferments. The new law provides 
deferment, on request, to full­
time undergraduate college stu­
dents, so long as they are mak­
ing satisfactory progress to­
ward a degree. (An extremely 
useful and responsible source 
of information respecting draft 
law and procedures, the Cen- 
tial Committee for Conscienti­
ous Objectors, 2016 Walnut St., 
Philadelphia 19103, advices un­
dergraduate college students, 
“II-S deferment is mandatory 
for undergraduates so long as 
tne following conditions are met 
e&ch year: (a) Student has i>~. 
quested II-S deferment in writ­
ing, (b) School has sent Stu­
dent Certificate form No. If»;-» ro 
the local board, (c) Student is 
taking a full-time course load 
and is receiving credit toward a 
degree, (d) Student is making 
satisfactory progress toward a 
degree (e.g., in a four-year pro­
gram has completed 25 per cent 
of the credit requirements by 
the end of the first year, 50 per 
cent by the end of the second 
year, etc.; a five year program, 
then 20 per cent of the credit 
requirements by the end of the 
first year, 40 per cent by the 
end of the second year, etc.), 
(e) Student has not reached his 
24th birthday. To obtain II-S a 
registrant should make written 
request and see that his school 
has sent a form No. 109. If just 
entering college, a registrant 
should send photocopies of his 
letter of admission and deposit 
receipt to his local board as ear­
ly as possible, along with writ­
ten request for II-S. II-S is grant­
ed for one academic year at a 
time, and the regulations now 
specify that in determining eli­
gibility for II-S, the academic 
year shall be considered 12 
months from its beginning.” 
There is no longer any require­
ment of a certain class rank, or 
for a certain score on any test, 
to stay deferred.
It will be much harder for 
graduate students to obtain de­
ferments. Those accepted for 
graduate school by October 1,
1967, will be deferred for one 
year and then become eligible 
for the draft. Those who have 
already completed one year to­
wards a Master’s degree will be
deferred one year to get their 
degees. Those with one year to­
wards a Ph.D. degree will be 
deferred up to four more years 
to get that degee. Starting next 
summer there will be no grad­
uate student deferments except 
in the fields of medicine and 
dentistry and a few technical 
disciplines, most of them in the 
health fields.
The new law, perpetrated by 
Representative L. Mendel Riv­
ers’ House Armed Services Com­
mittee and its “expert” panel 
headed by retired General Mark 
Clark, disregard nationwide dis­
enchantment with the former 
law. Negroes and the poor have 
especially resented the student 
deferment: as we have seen, it 
was strengthened. The military 
influence upon the legislation is 
evident in his result. The mili­
tary desired the college under­
graduates to stay in school to 
provide raw material for later 
officer training, and perhaps 
also to avoid possible influential 
white middle class opposition to 
the war resulting from white 
middle class dead and wounded.
The drafters of the new law 
also chose to ignore criticism by 
Negroes, minority groups, and 
blue-collar people of the middle 
class, business and professional 
make-up of most draft boards, 
“small independent kingdoms” 
heavily weighted in favor of 
age, white skin, and service in 
past wars. Such boards permit­
ted to be arbitrary and caprici­
ous in decisions, defiantly in­
dividualistic in applying their 
power, created great inequities 
in application of the law. The 
new law left the power still in 
their hands.
The Mendel Rivers-Mark Clark 
touch is especially evident in 
the changes in rules respecting 
conscientious objectors. Under 
the new law a conscientious ob­
jector will be required to show 
that his case rests upon re­
ligious belief. The “Supreme Be­
ing clause” of the old law is 
eliminaed, reflecting Rivers and 
Clark’s intolerance of the 1965 
U. S. Supreme Court decision in 
United States v. Seeger. There 
the Court ruled that the draft 
law’s then requirement of a 
belief in a “Supreme Being” as 
a prerequisite for conscientious 
objection meant a “sincere and 
meaningful belief which occu­
pies in the life of the possessor 
a place parallel to that filled by 
the God those admittedly quali­
fying for the exemption.” The 
change is undoubtedly designed 
to restrict the variety of CO’s 
gaining recognition. It is espe­
cially individious in that it 
strikes at those, however sin­
cere, who have unorthodox or 
non-establishment religious 
views.
It is possible, however, that 
this change strengthens the ar­
gument that the conscientious 
objector section of the law is 
unconstitutionally discrimina­
tory insofar as it stands upon 
the “religious training and be­
lief” of the applicant. The or­
thodox member of an organized 
religion is accepted as a CO 
candidate with very little ques­
tion. But the free thinker is not 
provided for. The Seeger ease 
wisely held that conscience lead­
ing one to objection to military 
service need not be based upon 
belief in the orthodox God of es­
tablished sects, but could be de­
rived from a conviction or sense 
of a broader concept of being. 
The decision is exciting read­
ing. Quoting Paul Tillich, the 
Bishop of Woolwich, and others,
the Court took pains to respect 
the convictions of those who 
are guided by newer philoso­
phies than the Decalogue of 
Yahweh, or the gospel accord­
ing to Mendel Rivers and Mark 
Clark. Rivers and Clark are un­
doubtedly incapable of under­
standing the new theologies, so 
they have obscenely sought to 
smash what the Court had done. 
The God is not dead in South 
Carolina. We must await com­
ing CO appeals to see how suc­
cessful this Rivers-Clark van­
dalism has been. Some of the 
same appeals may also argue 
that the new narrower statutory 
section discriminates in favor of 
orthodox believers and is there­
fore unconstitutional
When the law section pro­
viding the CO execption is cou­
pled in day-to-day practice with 
the CO form, SSS Form No. 150, 
the government’s perilous jour­
ney into misty realms of theo­
logy and philosophy is plainly 
exposed. If the applicant an­
swers the first question, “Do 
you believe in a Supreme Be­
ing?” with a “Yes,” he then 
must go on to answer “Describe 
the nature of your belief . . .,” 
and explain, “How, whom and 
from what sources you received 
the training and acquired the 
belief which is the basis of your 
claim?” Again, the simple, or­
thodox answer is suitable and 
obviously acceptable. But ima­
gine the sincere young candi­
date who cites Camus, Sartre, 
Dostoevsky, Tillich, or mentions 
the Nuremberg rationale to his 
draft board!
Really, the consciences of 
many sincere young men, and 
today’s theologies, demand new, 
more enlightened standards for 
conscientious objection rather 
than the step back toward fun­
damentalism just made by Riv­
ers and Clark.
The new law also eliminates 
certain former CO appeal proce­
dures. State appeal boards are 
no longer to refer to the U. S. 
Department of Justice for an 
advisory opinion. Under the old 
law, this part of the appeal pro­
cedure furnished some depend­
able uniformity and fairness to 
the handling of OO’s.
Also, the drafters of the new 
law gave no consideration to ex- 
exmption for the selection cons­
cientious objector. The law con­
tinues to exempt only one who, 
“by religious training and be­
lief, is conscientiously opposed 
to war in any form.” (My bold 
face.) It does not, then, make 
provisions for the “selective” 
conscientious objector: the sin­
cere person who is not against 
all war but simply against this 
war. But, then, have you ever 
had a chat with Mendel Rivers 
or Mark Clark about situation 
ethics?

The “Shake-Up”
by
George Havach, S. J.
The Epitome of Pedantry
by
B-ttk W. Comet
It was with a great deal of dismay that we discovered an in­
crease in the yearly premium for student health insurance. In­
censed to inquiry, we telephoned the American Casualty Co. under 
whose auspices the CMU plan falls.
The agent we spoke to, let us call him Mr. Marne, was quite 
adamant about being awakened in the middle of the night, and 
grew quite indignant when we quoted John Cameron Swasey who 
said, “Truth knows no time.”
Our adamant agent took a licking but kept on ticking. He ex­
plained that the increase in the premium was due directly to an 
increase in the risk. This was all brought to the fore last year 
when several insurance investigators, posing as agents for the 
Federal Narcotics Squad, sifted through the kitchens of our Food 
Service. “Statistically speaking,” said Mr. Mame, “there was a ten 
per cent increase of common Skibo Food Service maladies such 
as ptomaine, botulism and rat bite. The thing that really surprised 
us,” he continued, “was the uncommon number of coronary fatal­
ities at the cash register.”
Even the Snack Bar came under the dose scrutiny of the 
madras jacketed investigators. One, carefully disguised as a Mag­
gie Murph, secretly crumbled up pieces of Tartan-burgers and con­
cealed them in the false hell of his left penny loafer. Upon chem­
ical analysis it was discovered that Tartan-burgers contain no 
meat, but are made of ground up sweat Tartans filched from a 
Scottish gymnasium. Thus medical science learned the cause of 
the dread Skibo disease, wooly throat, wherein the cure is obvi­
ated by painting the throat of the afflicted plaid.
“There was one reassuring thing we found,” said Mr. Mame. 
“We had reports that salt peter was being added to the food to 
retard the sexual drives of the students. We found, after closely 
studying the student body, that salt peter was totally unnecessary, 
and furthermore that the student who started the rumor was, in 
actuality, addressing his friend named Peter when he said, ‘Pass 
the salt, Peter."’
With all the answers provided by Mr. Mame, we remain un­
satisfied. It is, as always, the poor proletarian student who suffers 
at the hand of the bourgeious, capitalistic, statistic-oriented dollar 
sign on the one side, and poison on the other. Arm yourselves! 
Write a letter to President Stever today!

The Epitome of Pedantry
by
Barry W. Comet
What is college?
College defines itself by what 
goes on therein. College is a 
human situation, and a lossely 
structured one at that—in con­
trast to such a tightly structured 
situation as an office job. In 
*rollege, for instance, it is possi­
ble and, indeed, quite common 
to proceed with the action-prin- 
ciple, “Never let your studies
- get in the way of your educa- 
tin.” A businessman can prevent 
his job from getting in the way 
of his work. Indeed, he would 
1 regard any distinction betweenP
job and work of an “academic” 
distinction. But aha. There sitirs 
Lhe beginning of an insight into 
the wonderous charcter of the 
college situation.
College is more than a situa­
tion; one must live within this 
situation: college is an exper­
ience. In bringing together so 
many people with such widely 
differing backgrounds, interests, 
looks, and styles of dress, it gen­
erates a free play of diversity 
far outside the scale encounter­
ed in “conventional” society. But 
to say “people are different” is 
a truism To any “people are 
unique”—which lies at the heart 
of the college experience—is an 
insight. To come to an insight 
is a discovery, and a discovery 
is arrived at only through a 
!^uest in a wilderness. The dis­
covery of the uniqueness of peo­
ple, myself included, is made 
only on emergence from a per­
sonal bewilderment in the face 
of diversity. Living the college 
situation, having the college ex­
perience, brings a “shake-up” or 
“shake-down” depending on your 
oint of view.)
“Where do I stand? What 
makes me me?”
These questions arise from an 
overall cumulative effect of liv­
ing the college situation. One 
can only see so many under­
ground films, be dazzled by so 
many girls, vibrate to so many 
TGIF's, attend so many free­
wheeling parties, live through so 
"any rough-and-tumble school 
weeks, before one’s assurance 
of self-consistency and every­
thing under-control is shattered. 
The self as a conglomerate of 
identifications beocmes psycho­
logically inoperable; the height­
ening and acute demand is for 
a new level of self-awareness, 
in short, a self-discovery.
We are brought to, or rather 
driven to, a crisis. Our growth, 
which may have only half-con­
scious and habit-conditioned in 
the past, Is developing discon­
tinuities, inescapable and made- 
to-order for us. Where do we go 
from here? We can’t go on just 
absorbing stimuli, however ex­
citing. We have to know it is 
£at’s being turned on.
Ourselves may have been de­
fined for us by our parents, 
peers, teachers, and much of 
our past life may have consisted 
of living out the labels we have 
received from others: “a good 
student,” “natural athlete,” “al- 
ways causing disturbances,” 
disrespectful,” “has he mak- 
atae of a good scientist,” “re­
sponsible,” “with a mind of his 
own.” “I” may have been only 
a place-holder in our every­
day speech before; now 
it is the center of our question-
ing, 1’homme inconnu, a verbum
incognitum. Faced with defining 
ourselves in our own terms, our 
defences come down; and we are 
no longer sure what it is we 
were defending.
The “shake-up” may bring 
anguished uncertainty, para­
lyzing doubt, ignorance of 
what lies ahead. All this can be 
fruitful; the discovery of our­
selves as one, unique, alive, 
developing, relating will come 
all the more clear-sightedly, 
without artifice or dodge. 
Faced with the wreckage of 
our neat, personal “world,” 
we must disconcern and sort 
out the salvageable from re- 
jectable (or merely dispens­
able) elements. The experience 
becomes the discovery and 
application of a new criterion, 
a new touchstone for decis­
ion: personal uniqueness, to 
be spontaneously myself. And 
spontaneity means freedom, 
self-involvement of an unex­
pected intensity, and a joy of 
acceptance.
The “shake-up” may sound 
like something to be avoided, a 
dreadful threat. Nonetheless, it 
will come when the conditions 
are ripe, and not before. In­
deed, it is not ours to either 
avoid or initiate; it amounts to 
an awakening to the fact that 
we are not the masters of our 
own growth — akin to George 
Harrison’s “Life flows on with­
in you and without you.” The 
college experience is a reorgan­
ization of our life on a new 
basis, and everything goes into 
the melt in the recasting pro­
cess. So the collge situation 
should be enjoyed for all it is 
worth; the discovery of self-uni­
queness opens up, in turn, a 
new field for further discovery: 
Life, People, the World. And 
that’s a quest worth embarking 
on.
Discussions Prepare 
Students For Future
Thirty E & S and AMS sen­

Confidential Form Distributed by HRC
The Pennsylvania Human Re­
lations Commission and the De­
partment of Public Instruction 
have asked the colleges of Penn­
sylvania to cooperate with them 
to secure confidential statistical 
information concerning the sta­
tus of educational opportunities 
for all students. Carnegie-Mel- 
lon will participate in this proj­
ect, which will involve the vol­
untary completion of a ques­
tionnaire by the entire student 
body, both undergraduate and 
graduate.
The data concerns race, re­
ligion and ethnic background of 
students. This infromation will 
be required in reports that the 
University makes to the Human 
Relations Commission and the 
Department of Health, Educa­
tion and Welfare, it is not on 
file with the University at this 
time.
Completion of the forms is 
voluntary and impersonal, and 
students are not required to fill 
them out. It is hoped, however, 
that the students will feel inter­
ested in completing the ques- 
tionnnaires.
The forms should be distri­
buted to students on September 
29 through dorm counselors 
and fraternities. Off-campus res­
idents will have questionnaires 
mailed to them. Additional cen­
ters of distribution will be set 
up around the campus to af­
ford every student an oportun- 
ity to complete the question­
naire. Forms can also be picked 
up at Dean Brown’s office.

Colonel William C. Grimm 
from the Pennsylvania Head­
quarters of the Selective Service 
System has accepted Carnegie 
Mellon’s invitation to visit tl)| 
campus to speak at a meeting 
of all male students. This meet­
ing will be held on Sept. 19th 
at assembly period, 11:30 a.m., j 
in the gymnasium. Colonel J 
Grimm will explain the new 
regulations in the amended Se­
lective Service law which went 
into effect July 1, 1967, concern­
ing students. ^ j
There are several changes 
from the regulations used last 
year which make important 
differences in obtaining stu­
dent deferment:
(1) It is now the student’s 
responsibility to request student 
deferment. The school can no 
longer do so. SSS Form 104 to 
be used for this purpose is 
available in the Selective Servic4 
office, Warner Hall 211. This 
form must be on file with each 
local board by Oct. 1st to qualify 
a registrant for student defer­
ment and should be sent direct­
ly to the local board. The school 
will certify only enollment as a 
full-time student as soon as 
possible after registration.
(2) Rank in class is no longdii 
a factor in determining student 
status, nor is the grade on the 
Selective Service Qualification 
Test.
(3) An undergraduate student 
who is making satisfactory pro­
gress as defined by the school 
is eligible for deferment so long 
as he remains a full-time student 
until he receives his first degrt$) 
or becomes 24 years of age, 
whichever status is reached 
first. At that time his Selective 
Service number will be placed 
in the prime age group.
It is our understanding that 
deferment for graduate students 
who have been accepted for the 
coming academic year or who 
have already begun a graduatO 
program will be given a 2-S 
classification for the academic 
year 1967-68 for 12 months. Be­
yond this transitional year there 
is no assurance that graduate 
study will continue to be de­
ferred except in fields consider­
ed necessary to the national 
health, safetly and interest as 
identified by the Director of St) 
lective Service.
Col. Grimm has stated that 
he is happy to have this oppor­
tunity to present Selective Ser­
vice matters relating to the ap­
plication of the new regulations 
to all college students. There 
will be a period during the 
meeting when students may ask 
him direct questions. This wiij 
be an important chance to get 
authentic information of concern 
to every male student at Car­
negie Mellon University.

CMU Drops Opener 
AtWooster:21-18
by Ron Finnin
Carnegie-Mellon University began its football career with a 21-18 loss at Wooster College last Saturday. Al­though Carnegie was able to equal Wooster in touchdowns, the game was decided by CMU’s failure to make extra points and by poor showings from the offensive and de­fensive lines. Tom Hubka’s fine passing led the Tartan offense, but on the ground CMU was powerless against a hard hitting Wooster line.

CROSS COUNTRY COURSE
Schenley Park Coarse
One of the most noticeable things about cross-country is a complete lack of student interest. Because cross-country is so exciting it must be assumed that any lack of interest is due to some ignorance of the sport. A basic part of en­joying any sport is being able to see. Here is your guide to a cross-country meet. ----------------------------------—
The Tartans got their first 
scoring opportunity early in the 
first quarter when a pass inter­
ception by Larry Getto put them 
on the Scott’s two, but a fumble 
by Getto on the following play 
was recovered by Wooster. Fol­
lowing a recovery of a Wooster 
fumble on the Wooster 44, CMU 
marched to the goal on a series 
of short passes and runs. Larry 
Getto carried from the three for 
the touchdown; however, the at­
tempted kick for the extra point 
by Chernay failed..
Wooster came back early in 
the second quarter on a sixty

yard run by Art Wilson, who 
rolled around the left side end 
and with beautiful blocking eas­
ily broke away from the defense. 
The kick by Potter was good 
and Wooster went ahead 7-6.
With only thirty seconds left 
in the half, Carnegie scored 
with a twenty yard pass to Bu- 
gel. The touchdown completed 
a series which began on the Tar­
tan six and consisted of a four­
teen yard run by Zak, a fifty 
yard pass from Hubka to Cher­
nay, a ten yard pass to Bell, and 
a pass interference penalty on 
Wooster which put the Tartans 
in scoring position. Coach Gas- 
perella elected to go for the two 
point conversion, but the at­
tempted end run by Getto was stopped.
It was a fired up Wooster 
team that returned to the field 
after the half, and in the final 
quarters Wooster all but domin­
ated the game. Wooster concen- 
tiated on its ground game and 
gained impressive yardage ag­
ainst an overpowered Tartan 
line. Wooster scored in the third 
quarter when quarterback Tom 
Loardman went in from the one 
jaid line. Again the kick was 
good and Wooster entered the 
fourth quarter with a 14-12 
lead. Wooster scored a third 
time on a 33 yard pass from
oaidman to John Bailly, one of 
the two passes Wooster complet­ed all day.
Late in the last quarter the
artans scored their final touch­
down from the eleven yard line 
when Tom Hubka, unable to 
find a receiver for his pass, ran 
the ball over. A pass for the 
two extra points was incomplete 
and, following the kick-off 
Wooster stuck to the ground and 
ran out the clock. Carnegie had 
one other good chance to score 
in the second half following a 
hard drive down the field, but 
was stopped by a pass intercep­
tion on the three yard line.
Carnegie’s weakest spot was 
its defensive line which gave up 
an impressive 335 yards rush­
ing to the Scots. A head injury 
to sophomore guard Giamelli 
v/hich removed him from the 
game early in the first quarter 
badly hurt an already weak in­
side line. The offensive line gave 
TARTAN quarterback Hubka 
spotty protection and all too of­
ten Hubka was nailed behind 
the line by Wooster backs. In 
the air, CMU faired much bet­
ter, picking up a total of 221 
yards passing. Ends Bugel and 
Bell had little trouble evading 
the Wooster secondary and fine 
passing by Hubka resulting in 
his receiving a post-game aw­
ard from Wooster College as 
CMU’s outstanding player.
Wooster played a much hard­
er hitting game than last year 
and the Scots were certainly 
looking for revenge for their 
18-6 defeat here last year. Woos­
ter quarterback Boardman, who 
is actually Wooster’s number 
two man for that position, kept 
to the ground and favored lat­
erals to his backs for end runs. 
The Wooster offense picked up 
consistant yardage around the 
ends and also off tackle. It 
should be noted that the Woos­
ter backfield consists of three 
sophomores and one freshman, 
a fact which might indicate 
tough Wooster offences for 
some time to come.
This Saturday CMU travels to 
Cberlin to duplicate last years 
14-7 victory over the Yeomen 
and begin what will hopefully
? a winningseason.

The Institution of Carnegie 
Tech was accused of having 
many weird people on its cam­
pus: (Dramats and P & Drs
with long hair and engineers 
with short hair and slide rules) 
not the least of which was the 
cross country team. Despite be­
ing at a school with high aca­
demic standards, the team man­
aged to win most of the time 
(54-2-1, for the last five years). 
Its nutty members would run 
after classes and on Saturday 
morning. They would jump over 
people on flagstaff hill and then 
run through the park.

Even through the school has 
a new fancy name, not all of 
the members of this nutty group 
have left. Three of last year’s 
eight lettermen are back and 
these men from the nucleus of 
a group that will keep this novel 
tradition going for quite a few 
years.
This year's team severely mis­
ses the services of four-year 
most valuable player co-captain 
Harry Burkholder, four-year let­
termen and co-captain Roger 
Cairns, and lettermen Eric Le­
vine, Ken Phillips, and Dennis 
Collins. All of these runners had 
the experience and consistency 
which must still be developed 
in this year’s team.
The three returning lettermen 
may not be able to keep the 
standards of performance as 
high as they would like. This 
year’s team, unlike last year’s 
which included four seniors and 
five lettermen, is very young. 
The first five runners will in­
clude the three lettermen, co­
captain Dale Peschel (senior), 
co-captain Bernie Flynn (jr.) 
and John Butler (soph.) plus 
Joe Lorhan (fr.) and Don Baer 
(jr.). The next five runners in­
clude two freshmen, two sopho­
mores and one junior.
The team is getting stronger 
very quickly and should provide 
interesting competition this sea­
son and for many seasons to 
come. On Saturday however, the 
six-year winning streak on the 
home course will be put on the 
line against Grove City. Grove 
City was one of only two teams 
that pushed last year’s undefeat­
ed (9-0) squad; and they re­
turn almost with the same team. 
The CMU team under the direc­
tion of Coach Carl Olsen is 
working very hard to get into 
top shape for the meet, which 
should be the toughest one of 
the year. They feel that if Grove 
City is beaten, it will be possible 
to equal last year’s unblemish­
ed record.
There are three methods oi 
watching a cross country meet— 
choose one: a) running b) walk­
ing c) driving If a) go to A1 else 
if b) go to A2 else go to A3:
.11—this is not the most com­
mon choice—Directions: Dress in 
gym clothes, bring map of course 
with you, wait at top of Flag­
staff Hill and join runners as they 
go by. Good Luck. (Next week’s 
Tartan will have the results.)
A2—this is the most common 
choice or circumstance — Direc­
tions: Be atFlagstaff for start of race. Walk to two-mile mark by 
crossing Schenley Drive and head­
ing west (towards Oakland), pass 
the Conservatory and turn left on 
the first dirt road. You may have 
the pivilege of hearing the Pipers 
as the runners go by. If you have 
walked fast enough.) After all 
runners have passed, head back 
for the finish.
A-3—this is the most popular 
choice — Directions: (Driving the 
course is not recommended). Go 
to point four and walk down the 
hill and see runners going to the 
two-mile mark. Watch them re­
turn at point four or five. After 
the first runners passes, you have 
four minutes to get to the finish. 
Points of Interest:
1) FLAGSTAFF HILL—the race 
begins and ends here. Most run­
ners hate the uphill start.
2) KILLER HILL—this is the
Shooting Starts
The CMU Rifle and Pistol 
teams are holding practices and 
meetings at the range on the 
C-level of Margaret Morrison. 
The rifle team, aiming for its 
second consecutive Western 
Pennsylvania Rifle League Cham­
pionship, is practicing Mondays 
and Wednesdays at 4:30 pm; 
the pistol team is holding an 
organizational meeting today at 
4:30 pm in MM B-10. All wD17tU
first mean or tough hill run­
ners meet. Often you can hear 
cries of anguish from opposing 
runners.
3) TWO-MILE MARK—the first 
runers arrive here in about 11 
minutes or less. They may look 
fresh, but they have just run one 
mile down hill. They now go up 
that hill.
4) T H R E E-MILE-MARK—run­
ners have just finished running 
up hill for one mile. They look 
tired (dead tired). Time is ap­
proximately 16 minutes. Tech 
runners usually gain on the hill.
5) COBBLESTONE HILL — this 
hill was included in the course 
to discourage all uninspired run­
ners. It works!
6) GOLF COURSE—a free down 
hill to home. Notice smiles on all 
runners’ faces.

SENTRY if INSURANCE
South’s overcall is known as 
the unusual no trump. It de­
notes at least ten cards in the 
minor suits and a willingness to 
sacrifice against the opponents’ 
major suit contract. The bid 
asks partner to bid his best min­
or, and when North bid dia­
monds, South sacrified against | 
the spade game. West had two 
ineffective choices. He could dou­
ble and set the contract 300 or 
500 points, or he could try to 
make five spades for 650. He 
chanced the latter, and lost a 
diamond, two clubs, and the con­
tract. Had South not bid, East 
and West would have arrived *1 
at an ice-cold four spade con­
tract. An important key to the 
unusual no trump is the vulner­
ability. It is obviously not worth 
500 points to “save” against a 
non-vulnerable game (worth 
420). There are no point re­
quirements for this bid, only ten ^ 
cards in the minors and favor­
able vulnerability. Thus, the 
unusual no trump, if used cor­
rectly, will aid in suiting your 
minor bidding problems.
