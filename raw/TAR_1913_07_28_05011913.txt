FOUNDER’S DAY EXERCISES
“Uncle John” Unable to Attend
The seventeenth annual Founder’s 
Day exercises were held in the Music 
Hall Thursday afternoon. The audi­
torium was well filled with students, 
friends of the Institute, and others 
who had gathered to do honor to our 
founder. The stage was garnished 
with wisteria, palms, and other plants, 
while beside the speaker’s stand was 
a vase of roses with five-foot stems, 
a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie. On 
the stage were seated the Board of 
Trustees, the heads of the various 
departments of the Institute, Rev. 
Dr. Alexander of the first Presby­
terian Church, who pronounced the 
invocation, and the Mendelssohn Male. 
Choir who sang several selections 
throughout the exercises.
Owing to the absence of Pres. Wm. 
Frew on account of illness, Judge 
John D. Schaefer presided. He an­
nounced the prize awards for the In­
ternational Art Exhibit, now on view 
in the Art Galleries and said that 
the exhibition was larger, finer, and 
more varied this year than ever be­
fore. He also read the following 
message from Mr. Carnegie and then 
a telegram, signed simply “Uncle 
John.” and sending love and best 
wishes. Dr. Brashear had missed 
the exercises for the first time, hav­
ing been called to Washington on 
important business.
Mr. Carnegie’s Message.
Again the anniversary of the open­
ing of our Institute draws near. I 
cannot refrain from sending my con­
gratulations on continued success— 
higher and higher you climb year af­
ter year. When the ascension is to 
stop is the question. It will not be 
in our day nor for generations to 
come, for there lies in the soul of 
such useful institutions the germ of 
immortality. The old lands have In­
stitutions which bear the wear and 
tear of centuries. The older they are 
the more precious their fruits. Our 
Institute is only a stripling, but a 
lusty youth, thanks to the care and 
abilities of the trustees, whose hearts 
are in the work of rendering faithful 
service without reward, except the 
highest of all rewards, the conscious­
ness that they are of use to their 
less fortunate fellow men. You are 
this year enjoying great entensions, 
which enable you to increase the 
number of your students, and the end 
is not yet. On the contrary you have 
just had a good start. I wish once 
more to express the deep gratitude

GREAT MOB ATTENDS.
Greatest Show on Earth a Huge Suc­
cess—P. T. Barnum Beaten at 
His Own Idea.
The first annual production of the 
show and Big Tent Circus that made 
P. T. Barnum lose money was held 
on Wednesday, April 23, at the 
"Field-house-Collandseeumet - Bawl- 
rume.” This world renowned show 
was the first of its kind ever presented 
to the peoples of the universe and 
being the only one of its kind, the 
tent was crowded to overflowing and 
many were lined up outside trying 
to see through the concrete walls of 
the tent.
To be serious the circus was one 
of the best amateur ones ever pre­
sented in this or any other city. The 
“Grand Reveux” was participated in 
by all the performers, even the mon­
key, about whom, it was said, could 
not be told from the real ones at 
Highland Park. The clever skit pre­
sented by Messrs. Crawford and Cam­
eron of the Glee Club was received 
with much enthusiasm. The tumb­
ling act was as clever as any that 
has ever been presented to the gen­
eral public. This act was presented 
'by Mr. McCullough, Dr. Marks, and 
Mr. Eyman. This trio also gave the 
audience a number of thrills on the 
parallel bars, and the trapeze.
The great “conglomeration” act fea­
turing the famous Captain Gearhart 
and Ex-captain Vail, in the “World 
Series of 1913,” for the champion­
ship in America’s Greatest Game, was 
loudly applauded. The great pugilist 
champion, “Jack Johnson,” was also 
in our midst and although his op­
ponent got ‘cold feet’ and failed to 
show up for the scheduled bout, a 
newcomer, who came to see the 
“Great Jack” scrap, took the ring 
and knocked the ‘champ’ out in the 
third round, therefore having the belt 
presented to him during the perform­
ance. The ex-champion said that his 
failure was due to his bad form and 
also to “dope” that was put into his 
food after the “weighing-in.”
The chariot race was so exciting 
that the course was crowded by the 
spectators during the entire time. 
Fortunately, no one was killed by 
being run over, although several were 
badly injured and others were blinded 
by the tan-bark thrown up by the 
chariots rounding the corners. The 
race was won by “Geary” by a 
“head.”
The second half of the evening was 
spent in dancing and listening to
VARSITY COMES FROM BE­
HIND.
Defeats Allegheny, 4-2.
On Saturday, April 26, the Varsity 
added one to their string of victories 
by defeating Allegheny College, after 
the visitors had secured a two-run 
lead in the first inning. Hoerr al­
lowed three of the five hits of the 
game in this one session, and these 
added to a wiid heave by Moorehead 
and a wild pitch, gave the two tallies. 
After this spell all hands steadied 
down and but two men reached sec­
ond in safety. The Meadvillians held 
their lead until the fifth; then Car­
negie started to reach Hawk and three 
men crossed the plate. Another run 
in the seventh put the game on ice 
for The Tartan.
Except for the first part, the game 
was featured by the sensational field­
ing of the home team. Each of the 
men got in some spectacular work 
and kept the Allegheny players off 
the bases. Hoerr struck out 9 men 
and issued but two walks, and de­
serves most of the credit for the 
game. Hall did some good work 
with his big stick, cracking three 
singles in four times up. Lain earned 
his keep by hitting for two bases and 
starting the rally that won the game.
The game was started by Hoerr 
striking out the first man, Thoburn. 
Crossman hit over second for one 
base. Hoerr threw to Moorhead to 
catch Crossman off the bag, but Bill, 
in trying to get Brine into the game 
of tag, threw out into left, Crossman 
taking third, and scoring when Rob­
inson singled to right. Hawk ad­
vanced Robinson to second on a hit 
to right field and both moved up one 
as Campman collided with the ball. 
The accident worried Hoerr and he 
threw wild while the bases were full 
and Robinson scored. Gilbert was 
given four wide ones and the bases 
were again full. Hoerr recovered con­
trol and Richards fanned. Rose flied 
to Brine, who doubled Gilbert be­
fore Hawk crossed the plate, and the 
agony was over. In the second Tho­
burn was given the only other pass
after Bash had struck out, and he
stole second, where he rested, while 
the next two men went down. In 
the third Campman singled to left 
and stole a base, but got no further.
For the first four innings our men 
went down in one, two, three order. 
In the fifth, Lobert, first up, walked. 
Lain got right on the job with a
double-sacker, which placed Lobert 
on third, from where he scored on 
Hall’s single. Capt. Geary was too
BETHANY BLANKED.
West Virginians Lose, 10-0.
Completely outplayed, the baseball 
team from Bethany College lost to 
the Varsity last Thursday on Leeds 
Field by the lop-sided score of 10-0. 
Shuttleworth did what he could to 
stop the slaughter, but had little as­
sistance from his teammates, and 
every bingle went for a hit. Seven 
errors by the visitors, mostly by Bur- 
gan, added a few of the ten runs.
Urquhart pitched a star game and 
was given superb backing by the field­
ers. His speed and curves kept the 
opposing batters popping high ones 
or rolling easy grounders that the 
boys simply ate up. Every one of the 
Techites starred at some point of the 
game and displayed the speed and 
accuracy that is earning them the fame 
of being the best fielding team that 
ever wore the Plaid.
Kirk won honors at the bat, beating 
out three bunts in five times up. Brine 
gathered two singles, and Lobert’s 
one hit was good for two bases. Lain 
had the only triple of the game, caus­
ing the first two runs of the game.
Smith did the heavy work at the 
bat for Bethany, getting a single and 
a double in four times up. His two- 
bagger looked good for three sacks, 
but Lobert held him at second with 
a splendid throw.
The scoring started in the second. 
Lobert opened with a two-bagger and 
scored on Lain’s triple to right into 
the fences. Hall celebrated with a 
single to deep middle, scoring Lain. 
Gearhart flied out to Harmon who 
doubled Hall off first. Moorhead 
struck out. In the fifth, Gearhart 
hit for one base to left, and went to 
second when Shuttleworth juggled 
and threw wild on Moorhead’s tap. 
Gearhart scored on a \vrild pitch and 
Moorhead went to second. Urquhart 
hit through the pitcher, and went to 
second while Moorhead scored when

NEW MEN ON TARTAN BOARD.
The Tartan wishes to announce that 
as a result of the competition recently 
closed, two new men have been added 
to the Editorial Staff. The successful 
men are E. G. Hamilton and E. S. 
Rauh, both Sophomores in the School 
of Applied Science. The Tartan con­
gratulates them on their success, and 
also desires to express an appreciation 
of the interest shown not only by 
these two men, but also by the other 
contestants, all of whom could unfor­
tunately not be given positions. The 
new men will at once assume their 
duties as Reporters.
PROGRESS.
Many of us who attend classes each 
day fail to realize what changes in 
our Alma Mater take place in the 
course of a year. We know, of course, 
that we are moving forward but, being 
primarily concerned with the gather­
ing of an education, we do not grasp 
the steps taken to make our institu­
tion what we all want it to be. In 
order that those students who did not 
attend the Founder’s Day exercises 
may know what was said of us. The 
Tartan is reprinting a part of the Sec­
retary’s report on the progress of the 
year:
The Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy completed on April 20 its first 
year under its new charter and new 
name. The enrollment of students for 
1912-1913 is 2,798, an increase of 388 
over last year, which represents the 
largest advance made in any single 
3rear since 1907. This student body
comes from 39 States and 13 foreign 
countries. #
The major portion of the new build­
ing for the School of Applied Science, 
the cornerstone of which was laid last 
Founder’s Day, has been completed 
and is now occupied. Machinery hall, 
to house the departments of electrical 
and mechanical engineering and power 
machinery operation, is at present 
under construction, and will be ready 
in the fall. For the coming year ex­
tensions will be made to the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School and the 
School of Applied Industries.
The endowment has been recently 
increased by the receipt of $1,000,000 
from Mr. Carnegie, this being part of 
a gift he made in November, 1910, to 
become available when needed.
The first degrees to be given by the 
Institute of Technology to its gradu­
ates were conferred in June, 1912, on 
the occasion of the fifth commence­
ment. One hundred and fifty-five 
graduates received degrees, 52 re­
ceived diplomas and 119 certificates.
The bureau of recommendations, 
which is concerned in finding employ­
ment for undergraduates and gradu­
ates, reports a year of exceptionally 
satisfactory results. Over 800 stu­
dents have been aided to locate part 
or full-time employment, and their 
earnings for the year total $234,819. 
Not one graduate of these schools re­
mains unplaced.
FIRST SUMMER SESSION.
To Be Held June 30th to August 8th.
The first summer session of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology will 
open June 30th. The courses offered 
are not in all of the Schools but only 
in the Margaret Morrison and the 
School of Applied Industries. The 
lines of instruction are selected with 
special reference to the needs of those 
who are teaching, and also to those 
who are graduates of high and normal 
schools and who wish to prepare to 
teach art, domestic science or man­
ual training.
Xo entrance examinations will be 
held for any of the courses, but the 
applicant is required to send in an 
application including his academic 
record of his teaching record. The 
student must also present himself for 
a personal interview. These inter­
views will be held in the Margaret 
Morrison and Applied Industries 
Buildings on June 27 or 28. Regis­
tration days are June 27, 28, and 30.
The certificate given by the summer 
school is accepted by the State Board 
of Public Instruction for the promo­
tion of teachers.
Each student is allowed to carry 
as many courses as the schedule will 
permit, without having to pay an addi­
tional fee for each course. For infor­
mation regarding tuition fees inquire 
at the office of the Registrar.
In the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School there will be four departments, 
the Department of Household Eco­
nomics, the Department of Costume 
Economics, the Department of Pri­
mary Manual Training, the Depart­
ment of Sciences. The three courses of­
fered by the Department of House­
hold Economics are (1), Teachers’ 
Course in Foods and Cooking; (2), 
Course in Home Cooking and Sewing; 
and (3), Elementary Course in Dietet­
ics. The Department of Costume Eco­
nomics offers: (1), Sewing, and (2), 
Methods. Primary Handicrafts; and 
Modeling and Ceramics are the 
courses offered by the Primary Man­
ual Training Department. The De­
partment of Sciences offers a course 
in General Chemistry and one in 
Physiological chemistry.
The summer courses offered for 
men are Psychology and History of 
Education, Mechanical Drawing, and 
Shop Work. The course in Introduc­
tory Psychology is designated to give 
the student some acquaintance with 
the fundamental principles of the sub­
ject and a first-hand knowledge of his 
own consciousness.
The courses offered in shop work, 
include the three shops, Pattern mak- 
in. Machine Shop and Forge.
The schedule of five hours a day 
will permit one academic subject and 
a three-hour period in Mechanical 
Drawing or in one of the specified 
shops.
THE MATTER OF GOWNS.
The Tartan understands that the 
position taken by the committee on 
Curriculum and Scholarship of the 
School of Applied Science on the ques­
tion of the wearing of the gown at 
commencement is merely a recom­
mendation to the Administrative Coun­
cil, with which body rests the final 
decision as to whether the request 
of the Senior classes will be granted 
or not. If such be the case, The Tar­
tan respectfully urges the Council to 
grant the request of the Seniors. In its 
last issue, The Tartan gave its reasons 
for favoring the wearing of the cap 
and gown, and it wishes further to 
state that, if it be the desire of the 
graduating classes to wear the usual 
academic costume, such a desire upon 
their part should be gratified. It is 
quite as customary for those receiving
B. Sc. degrees to wear the gown as 
it is for those receiving B. A. or other 
academic degrees and, therefore, the 
Seniors are doing nothing out of the 
ordinary when they vote to wear the 
cap and gown. It is their desire to 
add uniformity, dignity, and distinc­
tion to their Commencement and any­
thing which can be done to aid them 
in fulfilling their desires along these 
lines should be done. The Tartan 
hopes and believes that the Adminis­
trative Council will look at this sim­
ple matter in that light and grant the 
petition of the Seniors.
Did you ever have spring fever? 
The Tartan Board did last week.

And then there is, or rather was, 
the Camera Club of blessed memory. 
It has passed away. In the language 
of its patron saint, it is sadly “de­
funct.” The autopsy indicates, either 
“over exposure,” .or a “developer” 
with impaired “vital index,” whatever 
that may be, we had it carefully ex­
plained to us once, but could hardly 
get a P on it now. As we dimly 
recall the specifications, you were to 
extract the square root of the dis­
tance from the victim’s third cervical 
to his sixth dorsal vertebrae, add 
the logarithm of his batting average, 
multiply the sum by the number of 
teeth he had filled and divide by the 
number of excuses for being alive 
that he could assemble in five min­
utes; result, his vital index. How­
ever we are not quite sure of the ac­
curacy of this definition, having been 
born entirely destitute of a vital in­
dex ourselves.
To return to the deceased Camera 
Club, the ex-members were accus­
tomed at infrequent and irregular in­
tervals to slink darkly into a certain 
room (which shall be nameless) of 
the venerable A. I. building, where 
they would huddle in a mysterious 
group, dark conspiracy formation, and 
tell each other that their pet cam­
eras had a new tooth or had said 
papa quite distinctly.
At intervals they would boast, actu­
ally boast, of having sneaked up on 
an unsuspecting English sparrow and 
ravished its picture. Some say there 
was a dummy camera erected in a 
corner before which each member 
prostrated himself as he entered, oth­
ers maliciously claim that this ap­
parent act of devotion was to find a 
safe location for the owner’s cher­
ished headpiece. Not that there was 
any disposition to kitflnap maverick 
headgear, but just on general prin­
ciples, you know.
It is rumored that disintegration 
took place in the club when certain 
members (who also shall be name­
less) attempted to vitiate the convo­
cations of the faithful with fish stor­
ies of dubious authenticity. The in­
surgent members claim that they 
could stand for a little “rough hous­
ing” of the truth in the interests of 
photographic fiction, but when truth 
was crushed to earth by the combined 
assault of camera crusaders, it was 
brutal to jump on the lady with a 
ton or so of fish stories that, judg­
ing by their perfume should have 
been used for fertilizer. Not even 
a specious display of apocalyptic 
photographs of glorified minnows 
posed before mosquito netting, whose 
meshes as well as the infant specimen 
from the busy marts of fish-trade, 
Had been given a fictitious magnitude 
by methods best known to the perpe­
trator of the outrage.
So passed the ephemeral Camera 
Club. Those who have plates (or 
films) to shade, prepare to shade them 
now.
- FOUNDER’S DAY EXERCISES
Continued from page 1.
Mrs. Carnegie and myself owe to one 
and all of you that gives to the work 
your devoted service without money 
and without price. We congratulate 
you upon the speaker, Governor Had­
ley, who has honored us with his 
presence and address. He has al­
ready done the State some service. 
May he live long to serve our coun­
try.
Secretary Samuel Harding Church 
read the annual report of the Insti­
tute. He announced that, “owing to 
the almost unrestricted liberality of 
Mr. Carnegie, the Institute continues 
to make progress in seven league 
boots, and the evidence of this prog­
ress is presented by the various ambi­
tious directors in almost overwhelm­
ing mass. He then reported the suc­
cess of the various expeditions sent 
out by the department of the mu­
seum, the additions to that depart­
ment, the department of fine arts, and 
to the library, also the work accomp­
lished by the libraries and Mr. Hein- 
roth in the Music Hall.
The report on the Technical 
Schools was as follows:

Governor Hadley was the principal 
speaker, the subject of his address 
being Historical Analogies. He spoke 
for about an hour on our present 
form of government and the political 
problems of the day and the changes 
they would effect, especially that of 
judicial recall of which he was not in 
favor. He hoped that the latest con­
stitutional amendments would tend to 
make the government more of the 
people and less of the politician. He 
said the question was not shall but will 
the people rule. This would be pos­
sible if they would take a patriotic 
interest in public affairs, and study 
the issues and seek solutions to the 
problems which confront the City, 
State, and Nation. As long as this 
is neglected and the people permit 
their affairs to be transacted by pro­
fessional proxies, they alone are to 
blame for the conditions which they 
criticize.
At the close of the address Mr. 
Heinroth rendered two selections on 
the organ and after the finish of the 
exercises Governor Hadley held an 
informal reception on the platform.

their education. If they are suitably 
impressed with the friendly atmos­
phere, here at Tech they .will natur­
ally desire to come here. The school 
courses will take care of themselves 
so it’s up to us to boost. If you 
see some strangers wandering around 
take them in tow. Show them over 
the buildings and tell them all about 
the school. Try it just once and you

CLARKSBURG TRIP.
The Musical Club left Pittsburgh 
at 7:45 a. m. Saturday via B. & O. 
for Clarksburg. W. Va. A stopover 
was made at Fairmont, where the 
elub had dinner at the Watson Hotel. 
A special car of the Fairmont and 
Clarksburg Traction Co. took the 
club to Clarksburg, arriving at 4:45 
p. m..
Among the many enjoyable fea­
tures of the street car ride was one 
which caused a great laugh. It seems 
that the most attractive object in the 
eye of the present day student is 
as Prof. Colletti would say “La 
poulet,” or in the vernacular of the 
newsboy, “chicken.” The car was
making 40 miles an hour at a point 
up the hill, from which ran a series
oi steps. Poised on the top step, 
carrying a small bag, was the latest 
creation in feminine dress, gazing 
away on to the broad expanse of farm 
land. Suddenly as if the sirens of a 
thousand factories had opened, came 
the piercing ones from 50 students. 
This so startled the young maiden 
that she turned and the men, instead 
of seeing her as smiling and pink­
cheeked, beheld a dusky dame of the 
plantation type. A large laugh was 
the result of a great effort.
A delegation of the Clarksburg 
Scholastics under whose auspices the 
Clubs were showing, met the boys at 
the station, and ushered them to 
their clubrooms. Mr. J. M. Shields 
manager Scholastics, dispatched mes­
sengers about the city with the news 
that the Tech men were in town. With 
the aid of a “Lozier” and a “Winton 
Six” he succeeded in placing the boys 
in the homes where they were to 
stay for the night.
The concert was held at the Chris­
tian Church before a very enthusias­
tic audience, and was in the opinion 
of those present, the best college glee 
club concert ever given in Clarks­
burg. Among those in the audience 
were R. K. Fleming and H. W. Cros­
by, former Tech graduate Architects, 
who are holding positions in Clarks­
burg. A dance was held at the Colo­
nial Hall for the Tech men imme­
diately after the concert. This added 
much to the trip, and showed in the 
West Virginians a true congenial, 
hospitable and Bohemian nature.
The Club left Clarksburg at 10:45 
a. m., arriving in Pittsburgh at 8 
p. m. that evening.
NEW CASTLE TRIP.
The Musical Clubs journeyed to 
New Castle on Friday, April 18th, 
via “Special” on the Harmony Route, 
leaving Pittsburgh at 3:20 p. m. and 
arriving at New Castle at 5:45 p. m. 
They wrere ushered to the rooms of 
the Y. W. C. A., where a sumptuous 
banquet prepared by the “Business 
Girls’ Club,” awaited them. Distin­
guished local guests were presented. 
Attorney C. H. Greer, Dr. W. F. Lit­
tle, Prof. R. K. Sargent and Mr. C. 
O. Stahl.
The men were quartered in the 
newly erected Y. W. C. A., the secre­
tary of which turned over the keys 
to the Carnegie men and gave them 
every privilege.
The concert was given at the High 
School, one of the finest buildings 
of its kind in the State, and the 
club’s efforts delighted a large audi­
ence.
After the concert the Club went 
to a dance given by the “High School 
Fellows,” at the Peerless Hall and in 
the opinion of all it was a most en­
joyable affair.
The morning of Saturday was spent 
in enjoying the comforts of the “Y. 
W. C. A.” swimming pool and bil­
liards, etc. Some of the men visited 
the American Sheet and Tin Plate 
mill. The Club left New Castle at 
3:15 p. m. and arrived at Pittsburgh 
at 5:45 p. m.
The Musical Club men have noth­
ing but praise for the hospitality of 
the New Castleites, and even now are 
looking forward to the trip there 
next year, which is assured.

DUQUESNE WINS CLOSE GAME
Score 1-0.
Duquesne won the second game 
from the Carnegie nine on Tuesday, 
April 22, at the University grounds. 
The game was closely played through­
out as the score of 1 to 0 shows. 
Hoerr went into the game with a sore 
arm but gamely stuck it out for the 
nine innings. The contest was really 
a pitchers’ battle, with the two teams 
constantly on the alert to start or to 
stop a raid on their opponent’s forces. 
Hoerr issued two free passes in the 
first, then regained control, while Mee­
han gave his only two bases on balls 
in the third. The Duquesne nine 
gathered in more hits than the Tech 
team, but they were well scattered 
and the advantage was balanced by 
superior fielding by the Tartan de­
fenders.
The only run of the game came in 
the seventh inning. With two men 
down, Morrow hit over Lobert’s head 
for two bases. Glitsch hit to right 
for a single, and Crider threw wild 
in trying to get the ball back into'the 
diamond. Morrow scored on the er­
ror. Meehan hit between first and 
second, and Glitsch ran into the ball, 
making the third out.
Gearhart did some sensational field­
ing and Hall drew applause with 
spectacular performances, stopping 
the ball once with his bare hand and 
recovering in time to throw the bat­
ter out at first.
Lobert and Moorhead were the only 
Techites to' get credit for hits. The 
Southsider gathered a double and a 
single, but could not get past second 
on either. Moorhead’s was a single, 
and he stole second, but was caught 
off the bag by Meehan’s throw to 
McGowan.
The score:
Carnegie Tech R. H. P. A. E.

6THE TARTAN
TECH STUDENTS GIVE OPIN­
IONS ON JAPANESE 
SITUATION.
No War Sentiment in Japan.
The effort to enact a law prohibit­
ing the Japanese from holding land, 
has again agitated the Japanese ques­
tion in California. The thought of 
war, however, seems to be only news­
paper speculation and should not be 
considered seriously. That, at least, is 
the general opinion of Messrs. Hirai, 
Komoda, and Nakayama, Japanese 
students at the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. When asked to express 
their views on the subject, they re­
plied rather reluctantly at first. But 
they proved to be thoroughly familiar 
with existing conditions.
Mr. Nakayana attributed the con­
troversy to the attitude of the labor­
ing classes. ‘‘You see,” he said, “in 
Japan the government is in the hands 
of the middle classes, the land owners 
and merchants. The laboring classes 
have nothing to do with it. In Amer­
ica it is different. The laboring clas­
ses can cause the government to do 
what they want done. They have 
power.
“So we in Japan think that the 
trouble about separate schools for 
Japanese children some years ago 
and this present land trouble is due 
to the prejudice of the working clas­
ses in America against the Japanese. 
In Japan it is the working class, the 
lower class of people, which makes 
the war excitement in Tokyo and the 
large cities. But they cannot influ­
ence the national government.
“The talk about war is foolish. In 
Japan we are taught to look upon the 
United States as a great nation, from 
which we may learn. We are told 
that it is a country that favors peace, 
and for that reason does not keep a 
large army. It is only in California 
that the sentiment is against us. The 
National Government in America has 
been very fair with Japan.
“If the law were to be 
passed in California it would not af­
fect many Japanese. There are more 
than 40,000 in California, and only 
two or three hundred have land. It 
might cause fewer Japanese to come 
to California and others to go back. 
And it would cause some resentment 
among Japanese in Japan who have 
friends in California. I think it 
would be unjust to make such a law. 
But I am sure it would not cause a 
war.”
Mr. Hirai believed there was no 
cause for rumors of war. “There is 
no real foundation for all the war 
talk which is being heard,” he said. 
“The American people are responsi­
ble for it. News is made public in 
America in a way which arouses such 
excitement. There is very little 
sentiment of that kind in Japan. It 
would be a very unwise thing for Ja­
pan to take up arms against the 
United States. All the talk of war 
is among the people here in America.
“Japanese people do not come to 
America any more to make money 
and then go back to Japan, as they
used to. Some do still, but most 
of them, I found when I lived in 
Oregon, are ready to stay in this 
country. If they were given the 
privilege of becoming citizens of the 
United States, I think many of them 
would take advantage of it.
“If the Japanese in California are 
forbidden to own or lease land as 
other citizens do, the effect will be 
to stop their buying land leasing it, 
altogether.”
Mr. Komoda declared the preju­
dice is not universal in California.
“The sentiment against the Japan­
ese,” he said, “is strongest in San 
Francisco and the northern section 
of California. Among the laboring 
classes of San Francisco the anti- 
Japanese feeling is very bitter. In 
Los Angeles and other cities of 
Southern California the residents are 
in sympathy with the Japanese. At 
the time the question of segregating 
the Japanese school children came up, 
there was no segregation in the Los 
Angeles schools.”
Mr. Komoda was confident that few 
Japanese would be affected by the 
passage of the land bill. He esti­
mated the Japanese in California at 
between 50.000 and 70.000 and the 
number of land holders at about 3 
per cent. Of these, he estimated, 
only a small number hold 100 acres 
of land, more hold 50 acres or less, 
and the remainder, a very large ma­
jority. hold a few acres each.
“The Japanese government does 
not want the laborers to come to 
America any more,” he said. “As 
a result, the number of Japanese im­
migrants is decreasing. Five years 
ago 2,000 or 3,000 more came into the 
United States than went out. Now 
those returning and those coming are 
about equal.”
Whatever be the outcome of the 
legislation in California, these men 
are agreed on the utter improbability 
of war.
JUNIOR MECHANICALS' BATH.
In order to get the proverbial en­
gine grease out of their system, the 
Junior Mechanicals decided to have 
a swimming party. To say that the 
affair was a huge success would be 
stating it mildly. At first there was 
some doubt in.the mind of the super­
intendent as to whether ’the pool 
might not overflow when a certain 
slim fellow dived in, but by an appli­
cation of Archimedes principle, the 
laws of hydraulics and mechanics, and 
a little work on the ever-present slide 
rule we finally convinced him that if 
all the rest stayed out when the afore­
said slender person dived, there would 
be one-fourth of an inch between the 
water surface and the top of the pool.
Fancy diving stunts were given by 
some of the fellows, the most popular 
ones being the back dive and the 
“Beefsteak.” For particulars regard­
ing the latter, see the chief caterer of 
the Mechanical Society.
The Junior Mechanical baseball 
team is rounding into form and any 
department team of the Junior or 
Senior classes desiring games can se­
cure open dates from Manager Eisen- 
berg. In order to show the versatility 
of the class, we are willing to chal­
lenge any of the other departments 
to anything from a walk to Camp to 
Carnegie to a game of “Rum.”
“I understand they are going to re­
vise the football rules right away.” 
"Yes. They all agree there should 
be an entirely new assortment of acci­
dents.”
“Of all the monopolists the one we 
most detest is he whu monopolizes con­
versation and prevents us from getting 
in our word.”
At an Ohio spelling-bee recently the 
victor was a man eighty years old, and 
the prize he received was a copy of 
"Tom Brown’s School-days.”

The Sufferer (calmly)—“They weren’t

“Join the credit-giving coterie. It is 
not an instalment scheme, but a com­
pany of people who give honor to whom 
honor is due. No assessments, no offi­
cers, no meetings. Anybody can join, 
anywhere by beginning to stand on the 
coterie’s platform.”
“A true gift or calling, a genius for 
anything, is one of the strongest, most 
overwhelming realities in the world, 
and requires no ridiculous coddling. 
The man who is going to do big things 
will do them whether circumstances 
are propitious or not?”
One has only to mix with an Irish 
crowd to hear many a laughable expres­
sion, quite innocently uttered. As the 
Duke and Duchess of York were leav­
ing Dublin, amid enthusiastic cheering, 
an old woman remarked:
“Ah! isn’t it the tine reception they’re 
gettin’, goin’ away?”
He: “I can’t make up my mind 
whether to go in for painting or 
poetry.”
She: “Well, if I might advise you, 
painting.”
He: “You’ve seen some of my pic­
tures, then.”
She: “No, but I’ve heard some of 
your poems.”—Fliegende Blaetter.
Said a physician to an anxious 
mother, “Do you realize how much a 
growing boy can eat?”
“I should think I ought to, if anybody 
does,” returned she. “When we were 
up in the mountains this summer, the 
waitress would come in and say to my 
boy, ‘We have fried fish, steak, liver 
and bacon, baked and fried potatoes, 
rye biscuit, muffins and dry toast.’ And 
that boy Ned would say, “I’ll take it 
all, please—and some eggs.’ ”
Katie, the romping six-year-old, came 
dancing and singing into the parlor. 
Then, seeing a strange caller, she 
stopped abashed.
“This is my little daughter,” said her 
mother. “Katie, this is Mrs. Baggs.”
“How do you do, Mrs. Baggs?” said 
Katie, anxious to remove any unfavor­
able impression the visitor might have 
formed.
“I know a little girl at school named 
Saxe. Ts she any relation of ^ours?”
Look Pleasant
We cannot, of course, all be handsome, 
And it’s hard for us all to be good.
We are sure, now and then, to be lonely, 
And we don’t always do as we should.
To be patient is not always easy,
To be cheerful is much harder still. 
But at least we can always be pleasant,
If we make up our minds that we will.
And it pays every time to be kindly, 
Although you feel worried and blue;
If you smile at the world and look cheerful 
The world will soon smile back at you. 
So try to brace up and look pleasant 
No matter how long you are down, 
Good humor is always contagious,
You banish your friends when you frown.
A Mere Surprise
A report like a pistol shot rang out on 
the air, and Uncle Silas jumped nervously.
“Massy sakes!” he cried, “what was that? Anybody been shot?”
“Oh! no,” smiled his city cousin, “that’s 
only an automobile.”
“Oh!” said the old man, “somebody dis- 
chargin’ his show-foor?”—Harper's Weekly.
An Arab went to his neighbor and said, 
“Lend me your rope.”
“I can’t,” said the neighbor.
“Why can’t you?”
“Because I want to use the rope myself.”
“For what purpose?” the other persisted.
“I want to tie up five cubic feet of water with it.”
“How on earth,” sneered the would-be 
borrower, “can you tie up water with a 
rope?”
“My friend,” said the neighbor, “Allah 
is great and he permits us to do strange 
things with a rope when we don’t want 
to lend it.”—Boston Transcript.

A Texan and a New Yorker were one 
day discussing the relative merits of their 
respective climates.
“Down where I live,” said the Texan, 
“we grow a pumpkin so big that when we 
cut it my wife used one-half of it as a cradle 
to rock the baby in.”
The New Yorker smiled. “Why, my dear 
fellow,” he said, that’s nothing at all. A 
few days ago, right in New York City, three 
full-grown policeman were found asleep on 
one beet.”* * *
Little Mary was telling what she thought 
was an exciting story about a dream, says 
the Indianapolis News. She stuttered in 
her effort, gulped, and paused hopelessly 
without completing the sentence. “Why, 
child, what is the matter?” her. mother 
asked. The little girl smiled ruefully, and 
finally replied, I swallowed a word.”
* * *
It is a sign of nobleness in a child’s heart 
when he respects his parents. No moral 
duty is more clearly taught in the Bible 
than that of a child honoring and minister­
ing to parents. One will not be likely to 
treat his Heavenly Father any better than 
he does his earthly parents.
* * *
A little boy who was very much puzzled 
over the theory of evolution questioned his 
mother thus, “Mamma, am I descended 
from a monkey?”
“I don’t know.” the mother replied; “1 
never knew any of your father’s people.” 
* * *
One of the most important1 commands of 
the Bible is this, “Keep thy heart with all 
diligence, for out of it are the issues of 
life.” The keeping of this commandment 
means happiness here and heaven hereafter. 
* * *
“I say, Captain Bragg, has it ever hap­
pened to you to have your leg bitten off 
by a shark?”
“Has it ever happened to me? Why 
dozens of times!”
* * *
Tenderness is a mark of a great soul. 
One who is cruel to helpless things can 
never make a good or trustworthy friend.

Moorhead lived on Robinson’s high

over second, and stole a sack while 
Gearhart was swinging. Moorhead 
drew four wide ones. Hoerr hit to 
short and was safe on the throw 
home, which failed to catch Hall. 
Kirk beat out a bunt and all were safe 
on Campman’s juggle. Moorhead was 
caught off third and Brine was beaten 
to the bag by Hawk’s throw to Camp-

The second team opened their sea­
son with Wilkinsburg High School at
D. C. and A. C. Park in Wilkinsburg 
on Wednesday, April 23. The young­
sters won on superior team work by 
a score of 8-3. Fagan pitched a bril­
liant game for the most part but 
loosened up at critical times. His 
support was also erratic and the er­
rors were costly. In the eighth in­
ning Cunningham twisted his ankle, 
Auerswald was spiked, and Denholm 
was hit between the eyes by a line 
drive. Three of the eight runs came 
in this session.
