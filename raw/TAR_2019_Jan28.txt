Since Carnegie Mellon 
Dining switched food service 
providers back in June 2018, 
business has been slower than 
expected. Locations such as 
the Tartan Pavilion and Resnik 
House Servery, previously 
bustling around lunch time, are 
now quiet as students flock to 
other places to eat. 
About half of the 34 
dining locations across campus are 
managed by Chartwells Higher 
Education, which replaced 
Culinart Group last year. Both are 
subsidiaries of Compass Group, 
the world’s largest contract food 
service company, which turned 
out roughly $2.3 billion in prof-
its in 2018. “Is it embarrass-
ing for us?” asked Resnik cook 
Cleveland, referring to the food 
he has to prepare. “Honestly, 
yes. Yes it is.”
It’s also bad for job prospects: 
since January 7th, five full-time 
union dining workers have been 
laid off by the company while it 
continues to hire part-time help, 
in violation of its contract with 
the union. 
Though the management 
changed when Dining Services’ 
contract with Culinart ended 
last year, the employees, who 
are represented by the Service 
Employees International Union 
Local 32BJ (SEIU 32BJ), 
stayed. Layoffs like this are 
unprecedented in the past 
decade, according to one em-
ployee who works in the Co-
hen University Center, and the 
communication about them to 
workers was almost nonexis-
tent. “They were having a meet-
ing that Monday,” she said, “and 
they didn’t even call to let us 
know.”
The Monday she’s refer-
ring to is January 7th, the date 
of the poorly-communicated 
bidding meeting where Chart-
wells notified its employees of 
the layoffs. Bidding meetings 
are mandatory talks between 
Carnegie Mellon’s primary 
dining vendor and the SEIU 
where the vendor announces job 
openings and union employees 
get to “bid” on desired jobs based 
on their seniority (number of 
years in) the union. In the past, 
these meetings have occurred 
once or twice a year with plenty 
of notice from the company.
While laying off employees to 
cut costs during periods of low 
revenue is standard practice for 
many businesses, Chartwells is 
obligated through Article 8 of 
its contract with SEIU to give 
job priority to full-time union 
employees over part-time em-
ployees. The five people laid 
off, without wages and benefits 
like health insurance, were all 
full time workers and union 
members. Chartwells has hired 
several part time employees 
since the bidding meeting, and 
bumped many full-time workers 
down to part-time hours. 
The reason? One Dining 
Services worker, who wished 
to remain anonymous, ex-
plained in an interview with 
The Tartan that “when you’re 
full time you have full benefits: 
health insurance, 401K, 
pension, holiday pay, disability. 
You don’t get any of that part-
time.” Previously, he had to work 
180 hours part-time to become 
a full-time employee with 
union benefits, and remembers 
feeling relief after qualifying 
just a few months ago. This 
employee, who has a two-year-
old daughter at home, has been 
working part-time for three 
weeks now after being bumped 
down from full-time status. 
 The lack of revenue, say 
many of the workers, is due to 
an unwillingness to listen to the 
experience of the people who 
have been cooking and serv-
ing food at Carnegie Mellon for 
years. “We know what students 
like to eat, and they don’t lis-
ten to our ideas,” said another 
employee. Cleveland, who is 
entering his eleventh season 
here, said that under Chartwells’ 
management, he has less 
autonomy over what he cooks. 
“I was making my own menu 
at Chef’s Table,” he said, “they 
won’t let me do my thing.” He 
reminisced about cooking under 
different management, where he 
made homemade mac n’ cheese, 
alligator gumbo, and even 
turned a corned-beef Rueben 
into a sausage. Now, he cooks 
what the head chefs give him, as 
determined by Chartwells.
Whether or not the layoffs 
were Chartwells’ or Carnegie 
Mellon Dining’s decision is un-
clear. Director of Dining Pascal 
Peter said that while Dining 
“collaborates with all on-cam-
pus dining partners, including 
Chartwells, with the goal of 
enhancing the overall dining 
experience,” since Chartwells 
employees aren’t Carnegie 
Mellon employees, “Chartwells 
does not defer to Carnegie 
Mellon regarding employment 
decisions.”
According to a union 
spokesperson, at the end of last 
semester there were 118 full-
time (union) employees and 
around 35 part-time (non-union) 
employees. At the meeting on 
January 7th, Chartwells initially 
proposed cutting 18 full-time 
jobs. SEIU workers responded 
quickly with demonstrations 
and meetings with Chartwells’ 
site manager Jeff Sinciline, and 
negotiated down to five layoffs. 
Their goal, however, is to 
return all of their employees to 
work and to ensure that full-time 
employees are given priority over 
part-time employees. The union 
wrote a proposal for Chartwells 
that would accomplish those

Chartwells food service workers organize against layoffs
Dr. Cranor heads CyLab 
 EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
CyLab, Carnegie Mellon 
University’s institute dedicated 
to security and privacy, has a new 
director: Dr. Lorrie Cranor, the 
FORE Systems Professor of Com-
puter Science and Engineering 
and Public Policy. Cranor also 
directs the CyLab Usable Privacy 
and Security Laboratory (CUPS) 
and the University’s Privacy 
Engineering Masters program 
— the only masters program of 
its kind in the world. Outside of 
her career at Carnegie Mellon, 
Cranor served as the Chief 
Technologist of the Federal 
Trade Commission in 2016, and 
was chosen as director after 
what was described in a univer-
sity press release, distributed by 
PRNewswire, as a “rigorous in-
ternational search.”
In a university press release, 
Cranor described herself as 
“honored and thrilled” about 
her new position. “I look for-
ward to supporting CyLab’s on-
going success and bolstering 
research aimed at making our 
increasingly digital world safe 
and trustworthy.”
Starting out, Cranor wants 
to learn more about the in-
terests of students, staff, and 
faculty within CyLab, and cre-
ate a research and logistics 
roadmap for the next few years, 
which could include aspects 
such as what areas need more 
researchers, which on-campus 
researchers in similar areas 
should be brought under the 
umbrella of Cylab, and expand-
ing corporate partnerships and 
community outreach.
“[Carnegie Mellon] is some-
what unique in our interdisci-
plinary and collaborative ap-
proach to security and privacy 
and I’m hoping we can find ways 
to better leverage that,” Cranor 
said in an interview with The 
Tartan.
Outreach was also very much 
on her mind, especially to wom-
en, a demographic lacking in the 
security field. “At [Carnegie Mel-
lon] we are involved in a number

This past December, Carnegie 
Mellon University acquired the 
former Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ 
building in Oakland for 3.75 mil-
lion dollars.
It has been announced that 
the College of Fine Arts will uti-
lize the space. Plans have not 
been specified, but Pam Wigley, 
Assistant Dean for Communica-
tions at the College of Fine Arts, 
told the Pittsburgh City Paper 
that the space may be used “for 
media and performance work, as 
well as for film screenings by the 
Miller Institute.” Another option 
under consideration, reported 
by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, 
is building one or two stages, 
presumably for the drama pro-
gram. Some College of Fine Arts 
students suspect that the school 
aims to expand their film and 
photography programs.
In a statement released at 
the time of the sale, Dan Martin, 
Dean of Carnegie Mellon’s 
College of Fine Arts, explained 
that “for several years now, 
the School of Art has sought 
additional space for expand-
ing education and creative ef-
forts around time-based art 
(performance art, media, etc.). 
Additionally, the School of Dra-
ma has been enriching its media 
design and film/production cur-
ricula significantly with the ad-
dition of new faculty, staff and 
course offerings.” Dean Martin 
could not be reached for this 
story, but The Tartan intends to 
speak with him about the future 
of the College of Fine Arts.
Pittsburgh Filmmakers, the 
former residents of the building, 
have been teaching generations 
of students the fundamentals of 
producing, directing, shooting 
and editing since it was founded 
in 1971. Film screenings were 
regularly held in the Melwood 
Screening Room. A range of 
photography courses, including 
black-and-white film develop-
ment, were offered to students.
The non-profit, which merged 
with Pittsburgh Center for the 
Arts in 2006, had been expe-
riencing financial troubles for 
years. By the time the sale of 
the building was announced, 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers and Cen-
ter for the Arts had fallen into 
$500,000 of debt, stopped offer-
ing classes, and made major staff 
cuts.
Though this does mean an end 
for Pittsburgh Filmmakers, many 
see it as a new chapter for the or-
ganization. They have moved into 
the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts 
location and recently began offer-
ing classes again. A very forward-
looking article about the nonprof-
it was published in the Pittsburgh 
City Paper’s Jan. 9 issue. Christine 
Holtz, President of the PF/PCA 
Board of Directors, told the City 
Paper that “Filmmakers started 
as a way for the community to 
have access to expensive analog 
?lmmaking and photography 
equipment. We’re returning to 
those roots, where we’re going 
to be offering artists services and 
short-term classes. We’re just not 
going to be servicing universities 
anymore.”
Located at 377 Melwood Ave, 
Carnegie Mellon’s purchase 
comes amidst a continued effort 
to expand into the Oakland area. 
In Nov. 2018, Carnegie Mellon’s 
housing department acquired 
the Fifth and Neville apartment 
building on Forbes Avenue. Both 
of the recently acquired prop-
erties are of further proximity 
to campus than Webster apart-
ments, Fairfax apartments, and 
Residence on Fifth.

goals by merging some positions 
and rehiring the laid off workers, 
but Chartwells has not accepted 
the proposal.
In response to inquiries from 
The Tartan, Chartwells, through 
its parent company Compass, said 
that it values its relationship with 
Carnegie Mellon and “will con-
tinue to work with the union to 
minimize the impact of staf?ng 
changes.”
Awareness of these issues 
spread into the student commu-
nity with a ?yer campaign orga-
nized by SEIU members and a 
subsequent informational meet-
ing. Last week, students started 
a petition for Compass to accept 
the union’s proposal, which had 
gathered over 250 signatures by 
Saturday. The petition informs 
signers that Carnegie Mellon din-
ing vendors “play a signi?cant 
role in our relationship with the 
Pittsburgh Community, as their 
employees come directly from 
the city our school calls home.” 
Students have also started a Face-
book group titled “Support CMU 
Food Service Workers,” which 
features a link to the petition and 
more information. For more in-
formation visit the “Support CMU 
Food Service Workers” Facebook 
page.

and bene?ts. 
general, but in the scurity area 
in particular,” Cranor told The 
Tartan. Cranor cited the fact 
that Carnegie Mellon is due to 
host the Facebook and Lockheed 
Martin sponsored Women in 
Cybersecurity (WiCyS 2019) 
conference in March, stating, 
“We’re [excited] about being 
a sponsor of this event and 
bringing women security 
professionals and students to 
Pittsburgh.”
From the unsettling 
revelations about how Face-
book compiled and misused 
user data to Russian interfer-
ence in the 2016 election, cy-
bersecurity has been a hot topic 
in national news. When asked 
for commentary on these events 
through the lens of a researcher 
actively working in that field, 
Cranor first pointed out that 
many privacy experts actually 
found these headlines unsur-
prising. Although, she noted 
that “they have been somewhat 
of a wake-up call for the general 
public.”
“People are starting to realize 
how little control they have 
over their personal data and 
how their data might be used 
against them,” she reflected. “It 
remains to be seen whether this 
elevated level of concern results 
in long term behavior changes 
or new privacy laws.”
The concerns within the 
cybersecurity field are diverse 
and complex — Cranor says that 
“[i]t’s hard to point to just one 
big [one]” as the overarching 
concern in the field. Besides 
the traditional threats the 
field handles, Cranor gives 
the examples of artificial 
intelligence and Internet of 
Things (IoT) devices as potential 
new cybersecurity concerns. 
However, she points out that 
artificial intelligence could 
also be part of the solution to 
combat cyber threats.
All these concerns make 
the public understandably 
pessimistic about the fate of 
privacy and security in the 
digital world. Cranor rebukes 
this cynicism, saying that “[if 
she] didn’t think there was any 
hope, [she] wouldn’t be work-
ing in this field.” She does 
share the concerns about fading 
privacy in the digital age but 
believes that “it is not too late 
to reverse this trend.” Cranor 
says that “security is somewhat 
of an arms race, but it is some-
thing that I think we can keep 
up with.” She maintains that, 
while it is nearly impossible 
to achieve 100 percent 
trustworthiness or 100 percent 
security, 100 percent “is usually 
not the bar [researchers in the 
field] are going for.”
With so much of our lives 
stored online, and with digital 
trends changing as fast as 
the weather, one sure thing 
in our uncertain future is 
the growing importance of 
cybersecurity. For Cranor, that’s 
why cybersecurity “is such an 
exciting area to work in.”

Fans of Carnegie Mellon’s ever-
mythologized 15-112 class, titled 
“Fundamentals of Programming,” 
will be happy to know that its cre-
ators, Professor David Kosbie and 
Professor Mark Stehlik have turned 
their eyes to another project: the 
creation of the website CS Academy, 
a free computer science educational 
tool aimed at high schoolers.
The project, now generally 
available for the fall on their web-
site, https://academy.cs.cmu.
edu/, hopes to become the link be-
tween widely available program-
ming courses aimed at younger 
kids and the harder computer sci-
ence courses that start late teens 
on a track towards programming 
in a professional capacity. Erin 
Cawley, the program director for 
CS Academy, told WESA that while 
there are resources available to 
students from K-8, they tend to 
“drop off” before exposing students 
to more challenging programming 
problems.
CS Academy hopes to engage 
students using graphic and visual 
based Python programming. In a 
Carnegie Mellon University press 
release, Kosbie cited the fact that 
students often have trouble debug-
ging programs, and that lessons 
dealing with graphics make it easy 
for students to see what is going 
wrong with their code.
The project was piloted in 
schools over the past couple of 
semesters, mostly in Western 
Pennsylvania, a relationship no 
doubt bene?ting from the program 
direction of Erin Cawley, the found-
er of the Computer Science Teach-
ers Association of Pittsburgh. Over 
winter break, CS Academy of?cially 
launched, now offering teachers a 
chance to request a demo on their 
website.
The gap between beginner and 
advanced programming instruction 
is not news to those that study com-
puter science education, and many 
have tried to address it as part of 
an attempt to diversify the ?eld of 
computer science. A 2001 paper by 
former professor Lenore Blum titled 
“Women in Computer Science: 
the Carnegie Mellon Experience” 
cited an “experience gap” as one 
of the reasons women drop out of 
computer science programs.
“Many of the courses either 
assume students already know the 
requisite programming language 
or that they can pick it up on their 
own,” wrote Blum, noting that this 
often led women to feel discouraged 
in the program, since they may not 
have had the same chances to get 
exposed to the topic. Findings like 
this were part of the reason that 
introductory courses like 15-110 
and 15-112 were developed, in the 
hopes of leveling the playing ?eld. 
CS Academy, sometimes tacitly and 
sometimes explicitly, hopes to ad-
dress the same problem, not just for 
women but also for students that go 
to under-resourced schools.
Introducing a wider base of 
students to computer science is one 
goal of computer science educa-
tors who hope to expand the body 
of students seeking degrees, and 
CS Academy looks to accomplish 
that by allowing a means for stu-
dents to explore harder topics be-
fore they might be intimidated out 
of taking AP or hard intro courses. 
But pipeline issues are only one 
part of the problem facing those 
that want to diversify computer 
science circles. The other challenge 
to tackle is the culture that these 
students face once they have 
decided to pursue this path.

StaffEditorial Board
After enduring 35 days under 
the longest government shutdown 
to date, the U.S. now has a plan to 
open the government until Feb. 
15. President Donald Trump hopes 
that he can ful?ll his promise for 
a southern border wall in the 
next three weeks, whereas the 
House will continue to block his 
demands. There is still a chance 
that the President will declare a 
border emergency or prevent a 
new continuing resolution from 
passing.
Countless headlines have 
shown the effects of a prolonged 
government shutdown. 
Federal workers have missed 
two paychecks, food went 
uninspected by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), and 
federal employees were rationing 
their insulin. Most recently, the 
LaGuardia airport in New York 
issued a ground stop just this past 
Friday due to a mass of unpaid 
workers calling in sick. Although 
there is a temporary plan to 
reopen the government, we have 
seen another example of the 
consequences of having an erratic 
and hyperpartisan leader.
Before getting into the ethical 
violations of the extended 
government shutdown, it is 
important to discuss the ef?cacy 
of a border wall. The most 
obvious argument against the 
wall is the cost. The President’s 
own estimates over the years 
have ?uctuated wildly. Now, he 
demands $5.7 billion. In reality, 
however, estimates go far beyond, 
and this isn’t even considering 
additional expenses such as 
maintenance costs nor possible 
undermining of costs that were 
used to calculate these estimates.
Additionally, the border wall 
would obstruct water. Even a 
fence, despite having holes that 
allow some water to ?ow, built 
along bodies of water on the 
border can build up debris that 
ultimately obstructs water ?ow. 
A treaty made in 1970 requires 
that the Rio Grande river, which 
separates the U.S. and Mexico, 
remains open on both sides of 
the border. To accommodate the 
treaty, the Obama administration 
built the border fences so that 
it caved inward along the U.S. 
border, cutting into residents’ 
private property. Currently, the 
border fence allows the people to 
go through their property, but a 
border wall would interfere with 
free movement.
Obstructing water is not the 
only natural consequence of a 
border wall. Over 2,000 miles, 
the border hosts more than 1,500 
native animal and plant species. A 
study shows that almost a hundred 
endangered species would be on 
the brink of extinction should the 
wall be built. Consequently, the 
threat to biodiversity also affects 
industries such as ecotourism. 
Texas A&M University estimates 
that the Rio Grande ecotourism 
industry alone is worth around 
$463 million. The border wall 
would damage the ecosystems 
of some of North America’s most 
biologically diverse regions.
The wall’s ef?cacy is also 
questionable. Just a few weeks 
ago, a prototype of the steel slat 
that would be used for the border 
wall was cut with something you 
probably have in your shed: a saw. 
This contradicts the President’s 
promise to build an “impenetrable, 
physical, tall, powerful, beautiful” 
wall. House Homeland Security 
Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie 
Thompson (D-MS) agrees that 
there is “nothing special” about 
Trump’s wall. “President Trump 
likes to pretend a wall will solve all 
our problems, but it’s been clear for 
some time that it is little more than 
a very expensive vanity project... 
there is nothing special about his 
wall and it will not secure our 
borders.” Furthermore, the wall’s 
vulnerabilities are not limited to 
just saws; underground tunnels 
are still viable for smugglers and, 
of course, ladders and ropes do the 
trick, too.
The party of rationality 
and economics seems to have 
forgotten the basic concept of 
supply and demand. This principle 
can be found in various instances 
regarding the illegal crossing of 
the border in general. Marijuana 
legalization, for example, resulted 
in a 78 percent decrease in border 
marijuana seizures. The lowered 
reward for smuggling drugs 
attacked the supply end of the 
model, disincentivizing suppliers. 
A border fence, on the other hand, 
had no effect. Another area in 
which this principle plays a role is 
the general elasticity of demand 
for immigration. The president 
claimed that thousands of gang 
members were ?ooding into the 
country, but not even 1,000 of the 
total border crossers had violent 
crime convictions, making up a 
mere 0.2 percent. This con?rms 
that the vast majority of migrants 
are people who want to come 
here for a better life. To model 
the supply and demand curve, the 
supply curve would be relatively 
inelastic, meaning that since the 
demand to cross the border is not 
as affected by extrinsic obstacles 
like heightened security, the 
demand would not be as affected 
by the introduction of new 
obstacles. A more effective way 
to decrease the demands would 
be to reduce incentives to cross 
the border. By supporting coups 
in Honduras and other nations in 
the global south, the U.S. directly 
destabilizes those countries 
forcing many people to ?ee north. 
Instead, creating policies that 
would help those countries would 
reduce the incentive for people to 
cross over the border illegally.
Finally, even if the border 
wall was 100 percent effective in 
preventing migrants from crossing 
the border, federal data shows that 
a signi?cant portion of America’s 
undocumented immigrants 
entered legally and just overstayed 
their visas. Furthermore, illegal 
immigration has been declining 
for years, directly contradicting 
the “national emergency” 
narrative that has been pushing 
through. Erecting a wall would not 
be an effective measure, as it does 
not address the leading reason 
for undocumented immigrants. 
Instead, a more proactive way to 
enforce border security would 
be to make the immigration 
process more straightforward and 
transparent.
Perhaps Trump should recall 
his 2004 commencement speech 
at Wagner College the next time

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARDU.S. government shutdown temporarily lifted
ZHAOKUN LIU
Junior Staffwriter
It has been over a month since 
the U.S. government announced 
the shutdown and only a few 
days since it ended. The over 
800,000 federal employees 
who missed two paychecks are 
de?nitely the primary hostages 
of the current impasse on the 
border security issue. Travelers 
to National Parks and residents in 
D.C. are suffering from collateral 
damage. In theory, the shutdown 
should not have affected graduate 
students who depend on their 
stipends. However, on campus, 
where federal employees scarcely 
visit, we, a group of graduate 
students who depend extensively 
on federal and presidential 
records, were also victims of the 
government shutdown.
During the government 
shutdown, the National Archives 
and Records Administration 
(NARA) was considered “non-
essential,” and its staff were 
furloughed. The two National 
Archives in the D.C. area, the 
National Personnel Records 
Center in St. Louis, and several 
presidential libraries dotting 
the U.S. remained closed to 
researchers, regardless of their 
earlier appointments. During 
this time, all researchers had to 
cancel their original working 
plans. Usually, that does not 
only mean changing their plans 
solely for visiting the NARA 
and its associated facilities; all 
subsequent schedules in the 
following months are affected.
This year’s shutdown 
was extremely annoying to 
researchers, as they underwent 
a shutdown that seemingly had 
no end in sight and depended 
not on serious political bargains, 
but on the capricious decisions of 
reckless politicians. In previous 
years, a government shutdown 
was not an issue: both sides could 
straighten out the funding gaps 
in a few days. Such a shutdown 
could give relief to our souring 
eyes that enabled us to scan 
and focus on the fading scripts 
on the documents created tens 
of hundreds of years ago. An 
excursion in the city where the 
archives are located is also a good 
option. The only annoying part is 
having to pay several additional 
days charge for Airbnb or motels. 
How about a shutdown over a 
week without a predictable end? 
Going home and only knowing 
that the government is reopened 
the moment we arrived back? 
Staying in our Airbnb houses 
or motel rooms to wait for the 
archives to reopen while spending 
50-100 dollars per day? This is 
especially a dilemma to those 
foreign visitors who must pay 
thousands of dollars for air travel 
and invest great effort in getting a 
U.S. visa.
In December 2017, I scheduled 
a trip to the John F. Kennedy 
Presidential Library in Boston. 
Traveling from Pittsburgh to 
Boston is not cheap by any means, 
and the cost of living in Boston 
in December was about 100 
dollars per night. When I learned 
that a government shutdown 
was looming, I could only focus 
on the updates from Congress, 
worrying whether a shutdown 
would bankrupt me or truncate 
my research trip. Luckily, the 
shutdown did not happen then.
Even for domestic researchers 
who do not need to travel far 
or spend lots of money to visit 
archives, the shutdown was 
still a headache. For faculty 
members, winter break is a great 
opportunity for them to conduct 
any archival research, as they are 
fully occupied by teaching during 
the semesters. A shutdown in 
winter just ruins their plans, and 
they have to wait until summer —
assuming there is not a shutdown 
then.
For graduate students like me, 
this was an even worse situation. 
Students only have a limited and 
pre-scheduled period to carry out 
their research in archives. At other 
times, they must teach courses 
to ?nance their stay in graduate 
school. When such a shutdown 
unexpectedly happens, they 
cannot visit archives as planned. 
Neither could they be immediately 
assigned a teaching assistantship 
as those are usually determined 
months in advance. They were 
thus stranded on campus without 
payment. Certainly, students 
did — and are supposed to — 
do research in local archives for 
another part of their dissertation 
or begin writing with whatever 
they have. However, this was just 
a temporary solution when faced 
with a shutdown that seemed 
to have no end in sight. How 
about the students who were at 
the initial stage of their research 
(with few primary sources at 
hand) or whose dissertation 
depends almost exclusively on 
federal records?
I feel very lucky as I had 
?nished all my research in the 
NARA system in 2017 and 2018. 
I could not imagine what I would 
do had I scheduled all my research 
in the national archives and 
presidential libraries in this year. 
My graduation would certainly 
have been delayed. This shutdown 
certainly foiled my scheduled trip 
to the National Personnel Records 
Center this January.

Climate change has been 
in the news for a hot minute. 
However, the news that 60 
percent of coffee species are 
threatened by climate change 
surely caught many people 
off guard. One of the species 
is Coffea arabica, one of the 
world’s most commonly enjoyed 
species. To grow, it requires 
shade and cooler temperatures, 
both of which could be affected 
by climate change. Global 
warming will also make coffee 
plants more vulnerable to pests 
and diseases. Economies like 
Ethiopia’s, which strongly rely 
on coffee for export income and 
employment, are threatened. It 
is predicted that about half of 
the land currently used to farm 
coffee will be unusable by the 
year 2100. The consequences 
may be more immediate for 
coffee lovers like you and me: 
coffee prices may spike while 
quality spirals down.
Of course, climate change 
is not a new topic, but it is a 
persistent problem. The U.S. 
pulled out of the Paris Climate 
Accords in June 2017, showing 
the world its lack of dedication 
towards sustainability and 
providing a dangerous precedent 
for other countries to do the 
same. This can be seen in Brazil 
where newly-elected president 
Jair Bolsonaro plans to loosen 
protections that guarded the 
Amazon rainforests. As of 1965, 
landowners are required to keep 
up to 80 percent of their land 
forested. The new policy will 
allow for further deforestation. 
Unsurprisingly, Bolsonaro has 
suggested that Brazil pull out of 
the Paris Agreement, claiming 
“its requirements compromise 
Brazil’s sovereignty over the 
Amazon region.”
The consequences of climate 
change aren’t in the distant 
future. In fact, we have already 
seen the tip of the iceberg. 
Devastating natural disasters, 
record-breaking temperatures, 
and rapid extinction of various 
animal species have already 
been documented. Naturally, 
the annual “background rate” 
of extinction for animals is 
anywhere between one to five 
per year. This means that if we 
eliminate human contribution 
to climate change, we should 
expect no more than five species 
going extinct annually on 
average. However, scientists are 
estimating we have multiplied 
this number at least by 1,000 
and perhaps up to 10,000.
Even corporations have 
picked up on the effects of 
climate change. Phenomena 
such as storms, floods, 
droughts, and heat waves are 
a threat to many industries. 
In 2018, big oil companies 
demanded federal protection 
for their facilities lying on the 
Texas Gulf Coast. Additionally, 
banks worry that climate 
change will affect housing. Heat 
will turn consumers away from 
amusement parks. The food and 
beverage industry is already 
calculating how to deal with 
future shortages and overall 
trends, and the coffee industry 
is the latest to come on board. 
Supply chain management 
and operations will have to 
be modified to accommodate 
changes in climate. The list goes 
on.
The current trajectory we 
are heading in is pessimistic 
at best. Although it will be 
difficult — if not impossible — 
to reverse any of the damage 
that has already been made, 
the impact of climate change is 
becoming increasingly apparent 
and larger corporations with 
more power than everyday 
people are being incentivized 
to push towards sustainability. 
Even if our current politicians 
don’t appear to notice the 
exigence of the state we are in 
(or even go so far as to claim the 
phenomena is a hoax “created 
by the Chinese”), perhaps 
nature threatening a critical 
aspect of their morning routine 
might help them reconsider.
Anti-vaxxers now considered a global health threat
MADELINE KIM
Forum Editor
For the first time in history, 
vaccine skeptics teamed up to 
appear on the World Health 
Organization’s (WHO) list of Top 
10 Threats to global health in 
2019. Other threats include air 
pollution and climate change as 
well as diseases such as influenza 
and HIV. However, the other 
threats are more traditional and 
have made multiple appearances 
in the past, indicating that the 
rise of vaccine hesitancy is 
emerging at a higher rate than 
before.
“Vaccine hesitancy” is defined 
as the reluctance or refusal to 
vaccinate, despite the availability 
of vaccines. Currently, it is 
estimated that vaccination saves 
two to three million lives per 
year and could save 1.5 million 
more with greater accessibility. 
However, we are seeing a global 
return of diseases such as 
measles, even in countries like 
the U.S. where the disease was 
almost eradicated.
Vaccine opponents, commonly 
referred to as “anti-vaxxers,” have 
various reasons for their stance: 
some are afraid of injecting 
chemicals into their bodies 
and are convinced a natural 
approach to fending off illnesses 
is the way to go; others direct 
their skepticism towards “Big 
Pharma”; and in communities 
like the Somali community 
in  Minnesota, there are those 
who cite religious reasons. 
Regardless, pathogens don’t care 
about intent. Communities with 
a significant anti-vax population 
have been victims of outbreaks 
of preventable diseases, most 
notably measles.
Of course, the concept of 
parents refusing or even being 
hesitant to give their child 
immunizations to preventable 
diseases is not new. The hysteria 
picked up speed when former 
doctor Andrew Wakefield 
claimed that the measles, 
mumps, and rubella (MMR) 
vaccines caused autism, a 
false statement that led to his 
supporting study being retracted 
and his medical license nullified. 
However, vaccination skepticism 
continues. Thimerosal, a 
mercury-based preservative, was 
pulled out of almost all childhood 
vaccines despite lack of scientific 
evidence showing the level was 
significant or harmful.
Even our current admin-
istration has shown skepticism 
towards how vaccines are being 
administered. Just a year ago, 
President Trump’s evangelical 
campaign adviser responded to a 
severe flu outbreak by claiming, 
“We don’t have a flu season and 
don’t receive it when someone 
threatens you with ‘everybody is 
getting the flu.’” Copeland added, 
“We’ve already had our shot: 
He [Jesus] bore our sicknesses 
and carried our diseases. That’s 
what we stand on. And by His 
stripes we are healed.” Although 
Johnnie Moore, a member of 
Trump’s evangelical advisory 
board, claims that he doesn’t 
“know a single person in the 
White House who would agree 
with [Copeland’s claim],” the 
president has shared his fair 
share of hesitancy. His Twitter 
history shows he believes in a 
correlation between vaccines and 
autism, and his concerns during 
the campaign trail are further 
confirmation. Even today, many 
anti-vaxxers feel emboldened by 
the president and his message. 
Americans — or anyone, for that 
matter — should take medical 
advice from medical experts such 
as their primary care physician, 
but the truth of the matter is that 
people seek confirmation of their 
beliefs, especially when it comes 
from someone of authority.
Vaccine hesitancy is not a 
partisan issue. While the Left 
arguably began the modern anti-
vax movement — the measles 
outbreak started off in 2015 in a 
liberal part of Marin County, CA 
and a handful of prominent anti-
vaxxers, such as Jenny McCarthy, 
appear to lean Democrat — 
research shows that those who 
fall strongly on either end of 
the political spectrum are more 
susceptible to questioning the 
safety of vaccinations than those 
who fall in the middle. However, 
it is important to note that those 
who believe that vaccination 
should be a parent’s choice and 
not the government’s choice 
leans much more conservative. 
Regardless of where one stands 
on the political spectrum, 
they are potential targets of 
pseudoscience.
Modern science has come 
a long way. Over the past 
decades, new discoveries and 
medical advancements have 
allowed people to live longer 
and healthier lives. However, 
growing skepticism sets us back. 
As nice as essential oils smell 
and fresh produce tastes, none 
of those “precautions” will shield 
off preventable diseases.
Coffee becomes the latest victim of climate change

In the last two months of 2018, 
the most important elections in 
the run-up to the 2019 general 
elections in India took place 
in five different states. It was 
a litmus test to the Narendra 
Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party 
(BJP), and a possible preview 
of the general elections that are 
expected to take place in six 
months.
The arrival of Narendra Modi 
on the table of world leaders 
in 2014 was the beginning of a 
wave of big wins for right-wing 
politicians around the world, 
like President Donald Trump in 
the United States and President 
Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Perhaps 
studying how his tenure has 
progressed could give political 
analysts a rough template of 
what to expect from these 
politicians.
Five states went to the polls: 
Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, 
Rajasthan, Nagaland, and 
Telangana. Three of them were 
ruled  by  the BJP, the current 
party  in power at the central  
level: Chattisgarh, Madhya 
Pradesh, and Rajasthan, all part 
of the Hindi heartland, equivalent 
to the Rust Belt states in the U.S. 
In fact, those three states had 
overwhelmingly voted in favor 
of BJP in the 2014 Parliamentary 
elections. However, the 2018 
State Legislature elections saw 
a different outcome, as the 
three states voted BJP out and 
elected Congress to power. 
Granted, Parliamentary and 
State Legislative elections are 
different, yet with only six 
months left for the general 
elections, it is ample reason for 
the Prime Minister’s party to be 
worried.
The elections can be viewed 
as a warning to the party from 
the people, that the promises 
they made during the 2014 
elections of improved economic 
conditions for the middle class, 
elimination of corruption, and 
increased safety for women 
haven’t yet come to fruition.
When the 2014 elections 
took place, one of the reasons 
for Modi’s win had been his 
personal charisma: his image as 
a strongman who will not yield to 
foreign pressure, and the reports, 
drummed up by BJP’s brilliant 
PR and election management, 
that his rule in the state of 
Gujarat had led to its increased 
prosperity. The bigger reasons, 
however, were the failures of 
the previous United Progressive 
Alliance (UPA) Government led 
by the Congress.
The UPA had been in power 
since 2004 and in the run-up to 
2014, there had been a huge anti-
incumbency sentiment sweeping 
the masses. There was frustration 
that multiple corruption scams 
were taking place and that the 
leaders of the nation seemed to 
do nothing about it. Violence 
against women was on the rise 
and the 2012 Nirbhaya Rape 
case, in which a young woman 
was raped brutally on a moving 
bus in the nation’s capital, led 
to massive outrage that resulted 
in Congress losing most of its 
female voters. Amidst all of this 
came Narendra Modi with his 
sparkling track record in Gujarat 
and his promise to change the 
status quo — to make India great 
again.
Winning 282 seats, BJP had 
secured a simple majority, and 
as the leading member of the 
National Democratic Alliance 
(NDA) coalition, they had 336 
of the 543 seats in the lower 
house of the Parliament. It was 
a big win, considering that the 
last time any party had won the 
elections without having to form 
a coalition was back in 1984.
The Congress appeared to 
be decimated. Referred to as 
the Grand Old Party, its days 
seemed numbered. A 2019 
victory for Narendra Modi 
looked as though it was all 
but inevitable. However, the 
party bounced back in the 2018 
midterm elections. Breaking into 
traditional BJP fortresses in the 
Hindi heartland, it proved that 
the BJP still has cause to worry 
about the upcoming elections.
Primary causes for the 
Congress’s victory were not 
just BJP’s failure to deliver on 
its promises but also some of 
the most prominent economic 
decisions they made in the 
last 4 years — especially 
demonetization, which banned 
about 80 percent of the currency 
in circulation in a poorly-planned 
attempt to curb corruption 
and the poor implementation 
of Goods and Services Taxes 
(GST’s). Added in were also some 
of the biggest financial frauds in 
the country’s history, like the 
case of the Punjab National Bank 
where businessman Nirav Modi 
and his associates had defrauded 
the bank for approximately 40 
million USD, and managed to 
escape the country after that. 
He’d even met Prime Minister 
Modi in Davos a couple weeks 
before news of the fraud broke. 
However, Nirav Modi will only 
be joining a list of fraudulent 
businessmen who had fled India 
to London like Lalit Modi and 
Vijay Mallya who’d all fled in 
the last four years, blatantly 
undermining Modi’s anti-
government promises.
Another possible factor that 
contributed to the BJP defeat 
could be the fact that the BJP 
had concentrated on religious 
and caste-based conflict rather 
than addressing issues that are 
facing the people of the states 
such as the agrarian crisis, the 
crippling debt being faced by 
the farmers, and the collapse 
of the small-scale industries in 
rural areas post-demonetization. 
Much like how Trump had raised 
the caravan as a constant talking 
point in his campaign for the 
midterm elections, the BJP and 
its IT Cell started branding all 
government critics as “Urban 
Maoists.” Meanwhile, the 
opposition focused not only on 
countering these tactics by the 
BJP, but also managed to make 
policy issues the main talking 
points in their own campaigns 
that ensured that the opposition 
is more than just the parties 
that are not the BJP but also are 
strong contenders in their own 
right. There was an increased tilt 
of minority voter groups towards 
the opposition, which also was 
one of the major factors for BJP’s 
defeat.
BJP’s, and therefore Modi’s, 
prospects for 2019 are definitely 
bleaker than they were only a 
couple months ago. But they 
can’t and shouldn’t be written 
off just yet. Modi’s image as a 
strongman and his fanbase are 
still almost as strong as before. 
Plus, there are still doubts about 
whether the opposition can still 
organize themselves to fight on a 
national level. BJP is an election-
machine. And to counter the joint 
forces of Modi and Amit Shah is 
the real challenge. Put together 
with the fact that in the next five 
months, the government could 
enact various legislations that 
cater to different voter groups 
in different states and regions 
to secure their votes, BJP’s game 
is not over yet, as proven by the 
recent 10 percent reservation for 
economically weaker sections 
that was approved by the 
government.
One can expect the same to 
happen in the United States, as 
2020 elections near and with a 
similar defeat suffered by the 
Republicans in the midterms 
in the House. In the run-up to 
2020, there will be legislation 
that will be made to cater to 
Trump’s voter base, to ensure 
that they will vote for him. But 
the real game changer would be 
how the Democrats approach 
this election. If they project 
themselves as merely the anti-
Trump party, chances are that 
they won’t win. Democrats 
should rise up as beyond being 
the reactionary party to one that 
has its own strong policy agendas 
that resonate with its voters.
Perhaps the 2019 general 
elections in India, which will 
also be the first time that people 
born in this century will be 
voting, will provide answers for 
both Republicans and Democrats 
on how to approach the 2020 
elections.

SciTech Editor
For some time, scien-
tists have worried about 
the rapidly rising sea level 
of the world’s oceans. 
It was believed that the 
main contributor to this 
increase was glaciers 
in southeast and north-
west Greenland releasing 
large chunks of ice into 
the Atlantic Ocean. Now, 
a study published in the 
Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences has 
found that the greatest 
quantity of ice lost since 
2003 was from southwest 
Greenland, which does 
not have many glaciers 
and was not previously 
considered a threat to sea 
levels.
Michael Bevis, profes-
sor of geodynamics at The 
Ohio State University and 
lead author of the study, 
said, “Whatever this was, 
it couldn’t be explained 
by glaciers, because there 
aren’t many there. It had 
to be the surface mass — 
the ice was melting inland 
from the coastline.”
For 17 years, NASA 
and Germany have joint-
ly operated the Gravity 
Recovery and Climate 
Experiment (GRACE), 
which uses twin satellites 
to measure ice loss in 
Greenland. The data from 
GRACE has been invalu-
able to glaciologists, who 
estimate that Greenland 
lost 280 gigatons of ice 
every year between 2002 
and 2016 — that equates 
to 0.03 inches of sea level 
rise per year. Bevis and his 
team analyzed data from 
GRACE and GPS stations 
on the coasts of Greenland 
to calculate changes in the 
overall ice mass of the 
island. They found that 
by 2012, the rate of ice 
loss was four times that 
just nine years prior. The 
increase originated from 
Greenland’s southwest 
region, which had not 
been known to be losing 
ice so quickly.
Bevis believes that the 
accelerated melting is 
caused largely by global 
warming, resulting in 
inland water streaming 
into the ocean during the 
summer. “We knew we 
had one big problem with 
increasing rates of ice 
discharge by some large 
outlet glaciers,” he said. 
“But now we recognize 
a second serious prob-
lem: Increasingly, large 
amounts of ice mass 
are going to leave as 
meltwater, as rivers that 
? ow into the sea.”
The paper theorizes 
that the North Atlantic 
Oscillation, a natural 
weather phenomenon 
which brings warmer air 
to West Greenland, in 
addition to the naturally 
clearer skies of the 
summer season, combines 
with the effects of human-
caused climate change to 
melt an unprecedented 
amount of ice every year. 
While the North Atlantic 
Oscillation always has 
the potential to produce 
runoff from melted ice, 
its effects would not be 
so drastic without man-
made global warming.
According to Bevis, 
“These oscillations have 
been happening forever. 
So why only now are they 
causing this massive melt? 
It’s because the atmo-
sphere is, at its baseline, 
warmer. The transient 
warming driven by the 
North Atlantic Oscillation 
was riding on top of more 
sustained, global warm-
ing.”
While GPS systems are 
already in place to monitor 
Greenland’s ice conditions 
in the future, there are few 
resources available specif-
ically to study the south-
west region. Following 
his study’s ? ndings, Bevis 
hopes that additional 
instruments will be added.
The ? ndings also have 
a serious impact on the 
U.S. Rising sea levels put 
islands and coastal cities 
at risk of ? ooding and 
severe weather events. 
Bevis said, “The only thing 
we can do is adapt and 
mitigate further global 
warming — it’s too late 
for there to be no effect…
the only question is: How 
severe does it get?”
Ice melting 4x faster than expected
“We’re going to see faster and faster 
sea level rise for the foreseeable 
future... the only question is: How 
severe does it get?”

“Data is more like 
sunlight than oil,” pro-
claimed Google CFO Ruth 
Porat this week at the 
World Economic Forum. 
“It is like sunshine, we 
keep using it and it keeps 
regenerating.”
The data-as-sunshine 
idea is quickly replacing 
the old motto of the 
information age: “data 
is the new oil.” Though 
the sunshine simile isn’t 
new and Google isn’t the 
only corporation to push 
it, Porat’s remark raised 
eyebrows around the 
tech industry, as it came 
a day after Google was 
? ned €50 million ($57 
million) in France for fail-
ing to provide adequate 
transparency and obtain 
necessary consent for 
gathering user data under 
the European Union’s 
General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) rules.
Google, like almost all 
companies offering free 
services, collects stag-
gering amounts of user 
data in order to create 
“smarter” advertisements 
— and it works. Google 
made $27.77 billion 
revenue in the third 
quarter of 2018 
alone, with $24 
billion of that 
from ads.
The GDPR rules, 
which went into 
effect this summer, 
require informed 
user consent to 
data collection. The 
GDPR is why many 
websites now give 
visitors a long list of 
checkboxes to opt in 
or out of various types 
of data collection. 
American companies 
and websites are 
required to comply 
with user consent rules 
if they handle personal 
data from European us-
ers — including names, 
email address, and IP 
address. The companies 
whose business models 
depend on collecting user 
data aren’t thrilled.
“A lot of U.S. com-
panies have dumped 
everything they do in a 
consent box and have peo-
ple waive their rights,” 
said Max Schrems, an 
Austrian privacy advo-
cate, to the New York 
Times. Schrems, a law-
yer, founded one of the 
privacy groups that 
brought the case against 
Google.
“We’re deeply com-
mitted to... the consent 
requirements of the 
GDPR,” said a Google 
spokesperson in reference 
to this week’s ruling on 
the ? ne.
It’s understandable 
why Google, increasingly 
cast as a data-monop-
olizing villain in pri-
vacy controversies, 
would want consum-
ers to think of data like 
sunlight — free, clean, 
available for universal 
use, and ultimately harm-
less — instead of oil. 
Creating this new con-
ceptual framework works 
in favor of companies 
like Google, Amazon, 
Facebook, and Microsoft 
because it avoids a direct 
comparison between 
tech industry leaders and 
greedy oil barons.
The original com-
parison of data to oil 
is attributed to English 
mathematician Clive 
Humby, who drew the 
analogy in 2006. Michael 
Palmer of Britain’s 
Association of National 
Advertisers elaborated 
in a 2013 Guardian 
article: “Data is just like 
crude. It’s valuable, but 
if unre? ned it cannot 
really be used. It has to be 
changed into gas, plastic, 
chemicals, etc. to create 
a valuable entity that 
drives pro? table activity; 
so must data be broken 
down, analyzed for it 
to have value.” As data 
analytics has become 
centered in the tech econ-
omy, those who have the 
biggest datasets and the 
capacity to analyze them 
have the most power.
No analogy is perfect. 
But describing data 
as sunshine portrays 
companies like Google 
as cheerfully benign 
gatherers of a limitless 
natural resource, when 
privacy advocates see 
them as playing a more 
insidious role.
Data doesn’t come 
from the sky: it comes 
from users. While it’s 
still unclear if a person’s 
data can really ‘belong’ 
to them, tech companies 
take advantage of prac-
tical and ethical ambi-
guities to gather as much 
data as they can in the 
name of creating more 
targeted advertisements.

I’m proud to announce that 
the champion of the Tartan 
Fantasy Football League is former 
Assistant Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s 
team, GOAT but Ironically!
After the regular season, 
our league of eight was cut in 
half, with Editor-in-Chief Nora 
Mattson’s team newz, News 
Editor Adam Tunnard’s team 
Slugs, former Pillbox Editor 
Michelle Madlansacay’s team 
mmichelle123, and my team Gin 
and Bear It out of the competition. 
The remaining  teams battled it 
out in two semi?nal matchups, 
and obviously, the ?nals to 
establish bragging rights.
Semi?nal 1: GOAT but 
Ironically over futbol, 101.82 to 
84.18
Though Sio’s GOAT but 
Ironically was trailing earlier in 
the week, it pulled past Le’s futbol 
with a trio of solid performances: 
this season’s breakout star Patrick 
Mahomes, quarterback of the 
Kansas City Chiefs, put up 18.02 
points from 243 passing yards 
and two touchdowns; Los Angeles 
Rams star running back Todd 
Gurley scored 24.40 points with 
two touchdowns, and Seattle 
Seahawks running back Chris 
Carson added 20.80 points with 
119 yards on the ground and a 
touchdown. It was enough to 
overcome some lower starters, 
including Los Angeles Chargers 
wide receiver Keenan Allen, who 
scored zero points.
For Le’s futbol, Arizona 
Cardinals running back David 
Johnson led the way with 16.10 
points, but she left a lot of points on 
the table. Her bench quarterback 
Matt Ryan, of the Atlanta Falcons, 
scored 25.04 points, while her 
starting quarterback, Andrew 
Luck of the Indianapolis Colts, 
scored a paltry 9.68 points. With 
the loss, Le went to the third-place 
matchup, while Sio punched her 
ticket to the championship.
Semi?nal 2: TARTAN 
FANTASY over Last Manning 
Standing, 109.46 to 55.28
Qian’s TARTAN FANTASY 
demolished Miller’s Last Manning 
Standing in this semi?nal 
matchup. Houston Texans 
quarterback Deshaun Watson had 
a 22.36-point performance, from 
294 yards through the air and 
two touchdowns. Several other 
starters contributed, including 
Carolina Panthers running 
back Christian McCafferty and 
Seahawks wide receiver Doug 
Baldwin. After a mediocre regular 
season with many ups and 
downs, Qian found herself in the 
championship, almost like a 9-7 
team sneaking into the sixth-seed 
wild card spot and going to the 
Super Bowl.
After leading the Tartan 
League for several weeks earlier in 
the season, Miller’s Last Manning 
Standing found itself sitting on 
the outside looking in. Barely 
scoring half as many points as 
TARTAN FANTASY, Miller only 
had two starters who scored in 
double digits: New Orleans Saints 
running back Alvin Kamara with 
16.30 points, and Denver Broncos 
kicker Brandon McManus with 
10 points. Miller went on to face 
off against Le in the consolation 
game, while Qian took on Sio.
Third Place Game: futbol 
over Last Manning Standing, 
84.88 to 79.64
This consolation game proved 
to be an improvement for both 
team, especially Miller’s Last 
Manning Standing, but Le’s futbol 
still came out on top. For Le, Luck 
rebounded from the previous 
week and scored 21.58 points with 
a 357-yard and two-touchdown 
performance. While New England 
Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski 
didn’t score any points, her other 
starters made up for the de?cit.
For Miller, Kamara came 
through yet again, leading 
Last Manning Standing with 
22.50 points, while Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers quarterback Jameis 
Winston added 14.84 points. Still, 
it wasn’t enough, ending a season 
that began with high hopes for a 
championship. On the ?ip side, 
Le went into the season with 
no fantasy football knowledge, 
and she’s now one of the most 
experienced of the Tartan League.
The Championship: GOAT 
but Ironically over TARTAN 
FANTASY, 132.22 to 129.06
In this high-scoring 
championship game, Qian’s 
TARTAN FANTASY came close 
to pulling off the upset, but Sio’s 
GOAT but Ironically came back 
late to snatch the Tartan League 
Crown. Again, Mahomes led GOAT 
but Ironically, this time with 28.22 
points from 273 passing yards and 
three touchdowns. Three other 
starters scored over 20 points, 
Carson with 23.60 points, Rams 
wide receiver Robert Woods with 
22.40 points, and the Baltimore 
Ravens Defense with a stellar 20 
points.
TARTAN FANTASY boasted the 
Championship-high 36.46 points 
from Watson, as well as consistent 
performances from McCafferty 
and Baldwin. But while most of 
Qian’s team showed up, Green Bay 
Packers tight end Jimmy Graham 
was the difference, posting just 
3.40 points, and allowing Sio to 
pull ahead for the victory.
And that is it for this season of 
Tartan fantasy football.

This is Penalty Shouts, The 
Tartan’s sports column inspired 
by the The New Yorker’s column 
Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled 
column will focus on anything 
and everything funny in the sports 
world that is deserving of our 
comedic attention.
To be, or not to be, that is the 
question: Whether ‘tis nobler in 
the mind of New Orleans Saints’ 
fans to suffer the slings and 
arrows of outrageous non-calls 
or to take arms against a sea of 
referees and by opposing do 
nothing.
It’s a rough week to be a 
Saints fan, and frankly, a rough 
life to be a Saints fan. The 
NFC Championship against 
the Los Angeles Rams last 
week exempli?ed that. After 
the should have been pass 
interference call in the red zone, 
the Saints settled for a ?eld 
goal, which allowed the Rams 
to get back down?eld to tie the 
game and send it to overtime. 
If the Saints converted on third 
down, they would keep the ball 
inside the 10-yard line. They’d 
run down the clock. They’d hit a 
last-second ?eld goal, or score a 
touchdown, to put the game out 
of reach, sending them to the 
Super Bowl. Instead, the Rams 
won in overtime.
After the game, the league 
called Saints head coach 
Gary Payton to say, “yeah, the 
of?ciating crew actually missed 
two penalties on that play.” 
Sometimes, fact is a lot funnier 
than ?ction. The ineptitude 
of the of?ciating crew aside, 
the NFL keeps shooting itself 
in the foot, and some fans 
are starting to catch onto the 
of?cials’ gambling habits. Brad 
Puskar, resident of Pittsburgh 
and professional home football 
commentator says, “The NFL is 
the most rigged sport there is.” 
I asked him about basketball, 
and he told me that he doesn’t 
believe basketball is actually a 
sport. Maybe someday the NFL 
will realize that it is losing its 
most important fan, Puskar, to 
the league’s inability to control 
the vices of the least important 
people on the ?eld: the referees.
Hopefully the NFL learns 
a lesson from this and allows 
every single play to be reviewed, 
actually forcing every single play 
to be reviewed. It only makes 
sense. There will never be a 
mistake from a referee again, 
and the people, like Brad Puskar, 
will be able to tell the referees 
the exact right call on Twitter. 
Our favorite game will be even 
more interactive and responsive 
to the desires of the people, and 
someday, we won’t even need to 
have referees on the ?eld. We’ll 
be able to vote on our smart 
devices for the right call. It will 
be a true democracy.
Hopefully, the referees 
don’t ‘blow’ a call against the 
Patriots, or there will be a riot 
of Bostonians, a truly terrifying 
bunch, against the league of?ces. 
Their accents will scare anybody, 
Roger Goodell included.

Penalty Shouts: All penalties go extinct
The Tartan staff makes bad Super Bowl predictions
MATTHEW BENUSA
Sports Editor
We’ve reached the end of 
football season, and the New 
England Patriots are in the 
Super Bowl again. It’s old hat at 
this point to have Bill Belichek 
and Tom Brady face off against 
a team that, historically, has 
struggled to ?nd themselves in 
the ultimate game of the season. 
The script was written 10 years 
ago and hasn’t changed much 
since, but maybe the Los Angeles 
Rams, led by Jared Goff and Todd 
Gurley, could break out to drive 
the Patriots dynasty into a new 
era. If the Patriots win another 
Super Bowl ring, Belichek will 
become the oldest coach ever to 
win a Super Bowl. Tom Coughlin 
is currently the oldest coach, after 
their second destruction of the 
Patriots. If the Rams win, Sean 
McVay will become the youngest 
coach to ever win. There’s a lot 
at stake in the game, and the 
editors of The Tartan are making 
predictions about it.
Matt Benusa
Sports Editor
A friend told me that the Rams 
are going to lose, just because 
they’re not in the NFC East. Tom 
Brady is 1-3 against the NFC East 
in Super Bowls, and I’m inclined 
to agree. As an Eagles fan, the 
season was a real trip as they 
won game after game in the last 
half of the season, and then Nick 
Foles dominated the Saints in 
the ?rst half of the Divisional 
playoff game. Then the Saints 
defense ?nally stepped up, Foles 
completed, like, two passes in the 
second half, and all the dreaming 
of another Super Bowl ring was 
brought back down to Earth. It’s 
just another season. There’s going 
to be no wild last-minute ?eld 
goal attempts or Hail Marys, and 
the game is going to be tepid, at 
best. Tom Brady is going to be Tom 
Brady and sail into retirement. 
There’s no hope for the Rams, or 
anybody else. Final score: 34-24 
Patriots.
Marika Yang

Brady will drive the Patriots 
down?eld with less than two 
minutes left in regulation to score 
a game-winning ?eld goal. The 
game is a great juxtaposition 
of the old dynasty and the new 
upstart, but the Patriots aren’t 
going anywhere. Probably never 
at this rate. Final score: 38-35 
Patriots.
Sujay Uktarsh
Pillbox Editor
Sujay told me “As a Patriots 
fan, the Patriots are, unabashedly, 
the best team in the league. I 
have a feeling that Brady wasn’t 
playing as well as he could have 
throughout the season so he 
could save his energy for the 
Super Bowl. So based on the 
previous fact and theory, my 
prediction is that the ?rst half, 
the Patriots will play terribly, but 
the second half, we’ll see classic 
Tom Brady throw amazing passes. 
He’ll win the game with a clutch 
last-minute victory.” Final score: 
31-28 Patriots.
Jacob Paul and Adam Tunnard
Layout Manager and News Editor
Adam says that he played 
football in high school, therefore 
his prediction is entirely accurate. 
In spite of not paying attention 
to football at all this year, he 
believes the Rams will win 
because he believes in everything 
the underdog Rams represent; 
speci?cally, a shared hatred of 
Tom Brady. Who doesn’t hate 
Tom Brady? All that Jacob says 
is that the Rams are going to 
win. It probably has something 
to do with the nature of the 
hatred towards the Patriots. No 
one wants a team that has been 
consistently great for 15 years to 
continue to be consistently great. 
Final score: 17-14 Rams.
Tracy Le, Rebecca Enright, and 
Anna Boyle
Visual Team
The trio of Rebecca, Tracy, 
and Anna believe the Rams will 
win. Tom Brady will feel bad after 
losing the Super Bowl last year, 
and he’s going to try something 
insane that won’t work out. It 
will be something similar to the 
Philly Special last year, but the 
ball is going to get picked off and 
returned for a Rams touchdown 
with no time left to win the game. 
Everyone will be shocked at the 
poor passing by Tom Brady, as 
he only completes ?ve passes and 
three attempts are picked off. But 
James White keeps the Patriots in 
it. Final Score: 31-24 Rams.
Wilson Ekern and Frank Hu 
Copy Editor and Operations 
Manager
Wilson says that the Patriots 
are fascists: “Bill Belichek and 
Tom Brady are all Nazis, and 
they have to lose.” Frank laughed 
at that, so he obviously agreed. 
Wilson asked me the point 
spread for the game, which has 
the Patriots by 2.5 points, and 
then immediately said, “Rams 
by 5.” Frank laughed again, so 
he obviously agreed, again. This 
Rams machine kills fascists. Final 
score: 5-0 Rams.

Friday afternoon’s FA Cup 
fourth round drew together the 
red of north London and the red 
of Manchester as its standout 
tie. Arsenal found themselves 
newly rejuvenated this season 
under new management in the 
form of Unai Emery, achieving a 
whopping twenty game unbeaten 
streak, all while Manchester 
United were having their worst 
ever start to a Premier League 
season, as Jose Mourinho began 
to crumble in his third season at 
the helm. Their 44 points and 
sixth place standing have all but 
con?rmed people’s suspicions of 
Mourinho’s inability to perform 
in his third season with a team.
As for Arsenal, the end of 
2018 and the halfway point of 
the English soccer season saw a 
mild drop in form and a change 
of management for a ?nally 
fed up Manchester United. But 
the most dramatic point of the 
season was when Mourinho was 
?red on the Dec. 13. Then, on 
Dec. 19, Gunnar Solskjær, The 
Baby-Faced Assassin, took over. 
About a month later and the two 
titans of English football stepped 
onto Arsenal’s home pitch to ?ght 
it out for a place in the FA Cup 
Round of 16.
The importance of the game 
couldn’t be understated, with 
both teams ?elding what were 
primarily their ?rst teams, when 
second squads often ?nd their 
way into FA cup games. To start 
the game, however, Solskjær 
replaced in form forwards 
Anthony Martial and Marcus 
Rashford with out of favour 
Romelu Lukaku and ex-Arsenal 
star Alexis Sanchez. 31 minutes 
into the game, the latter two 
combined for a strike into the 
back of the net by Sanchez 
putting Manchester United 1-0 
against his old club.
Two minutes later and Jessie 
Lingard made it 2-0, before 
Arsenal’s mercurial striker Pierre-
Emerick Aubameyang halved the 
de?cit right before the break. A 
vicious second half saw Arsenal 
attempt to work their way back 
into the game with David De 
Gea making a few brilliant saves 
before Anthony Martial came off 
the bench to seal the game with 
a goal less than 10 minutes from 
full time. The ?nal was United 3 
and Arsenal 1.
Aside from still being eligible 
to win the trophy and the prestige 
that winning a game of this 
caliber brings, the implications 
for Manchester United are huge. 
Having endured for too long Jose 
Mourinho’s negative style of play, 
paired with his widely detested 
off the pitch antics, the arrival of 
Solskjær has brought new faith to 
United fans.
Solskjær won his ?rst game in 
charge 5-1 against Cardiff city, 
making him the ?rst manager of 
a United team to score ?ve goals 
since the retirement of legendary 
manager Sir Alex Ferguson way 
back in 2013. Certainly, against 
out of form Cardiff a win was 
expected, but ?ve goals never 
are. After handily defeating 
weaker competition for a few 
consecutive games, United had 
big wins against both North 
London giants, Tottenham and 
Arsenal, in the span of a couple 
of weeks. Solskjær made his 
presence known.
In his 37 days in charge so 
far, Man United has played and 
won each of their eight games, 
scoring a total of 22 goals and 
conceding only ?ve. The ex-
Man United player has spoken 
widely of his appreciation of the 
clubs historically famous open 
and attacking style of play and 
has adopted this to great effect. 
His player management has also 
been fantastic, unleashing the 
best out of players like Matic, 
Lindelof, Martial, and Lingard 
who underperformed under 
Mourinho. This change has 
been seen especially in Marcus 
Rashford and Paul Pogba, with 
the former contributing directly 
to a goal every 88 minutes 
under Solskjær, a 40-minute 
improvement from his stats 
under Mourinho. Pogba too has 
scored ?ve and assisted four in 
seven games under Solskjær, up 
from ?ve goals and four assists in 
20 games under Mourinho.
Manchester United have a 
new lease on life and they are 
having a better run of form than 
they have had in a long while. 
Less than a month and a half ago 
Manchester United sat in sixth 
place far off from even the next 
highest team, seemingly doomed 
for mid table obscurity. Now they 
have equal points with Arsenal in 
the league and only three behind 
fourth place Chelsea means a 
shout for the top four is realistic 
and reentry into the Champions 
League by that means seems 
possible. Fans have begun to 
dream again. Only one question 
remains, who will stop the Baby-
Faced Assassin’s United team?
Up next for United is a series 
of league matches, followed by 
their Champions League matchup 
against Paris Saint-Germain in 
the quarter?nal round. The last 
time Manchester United won the 
Champions League was under the 
reign of Christiano Ronaldo.

MOVIES
This is a great Netflix-produced documentary about the 
failed Fyre Festival, which in 2017 resulted in several lawsuits 
and endless mockery on the internet. It’s a fascinating and 
highly entertaining look at the event that is one part shocking 
and two parts hilarious. It’s amazing that the crew managed 
to capture all of this footage at the failed event, and the 
timeliness of the documentary’s release only makes it more 
jaw-dropping. Definitely check this out if you want to see 
something simultaneously informative and entertaining.
TV SHOWS 
This is technically a film, but it is a TV film and an extended 
Black Mirror special. The newest Black Mirror special is a 
choose your own adventure story. Viewers are presented 
with choices through the storyline they can make for the 
character. This leads to a twisted viewing experience that 
explores the ideas of free will and control. It is very well 
done and innovative, and the choices don’t feel cheap. 
Every small choice gets some sort of pay off. Be sure to go 
through the different choices for the multiple endings, as 
that really hammers home the themes of the episode.
NETFLIX PICKS OF THE WEEK
Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened
This is simply one of the best action films ever. A group of 
cops get stuck in a building after they are set up by a crime 
lord, and it turns into a fight for their survival as they try to 
make their way out. It is brutal, breathtaking, and relentless. 
The action is clearly shot, with the handheld aesthetic adding 
to the grittiness and grime of the setting without being 
too shaky. It has some of the best hand-to-hand combat 
sequences put to film, with creative choreography, stunts, 
and kills. Sure, there isn’t much character development, but 
the film is about the action and doesn’t pretend to be about 
anything else. It’s an astounding film, and would be great to 
watch with friends.
The Raid: Redemption
Black Mirror: BandersnatchSacred Games
This is Netflix’s first Indian TV series, but it is nothing at all 
like the flowery and sanitized Bollywood films that India 
is famous for. This series is dark and gritty, showing the 
seedy underbelly of India and the corruption, crime, and 
raw, real drama that exists within it. The first minute of the 
first episode features a dog being thrown off a roof with 
a voiceover deriding God. If that sounds like something 
you’re interested in, then check this show out. It’s an 
excellent, well-acted drama that shows the peak of what 
Indian entertainment can be.

T
he Gallery Crawl in the Cultural 
District took place on Jan. 25, the 
last Friday night of the month. From 5:30 
p.m. to 10 p.m., the entire district was a 
collective art feast filled with live jazz jam 
sessions, local artist pop-up shops, and 
different galleries’ fascinating exhibitions.
Start the night with tapas and drink at 
the Backstage Bar. Let the drum, the 
organ, and the guitar loosen your nerves 
and refresh your senses for a night of 
aesthetic adventure. Begin your gallery 
trip with some local artists’ work on the 
fourth floor of Radiant Hall Studio, a non-
profit organization dedicated to create 
and preserve studio environments for 
working artists. Then follow the sound of 
music downstairs to the first floor, where 
high schoolers across Allegheny County 
perform all your favorite songs from High 
School Musical. It’s time to put on a lip-
sync show with your best friends in the 
midst of the crowd!
If jazz and a musical still can’t satisfy your 
ears, make sure to stop by the Trust Arts 
Education Glow Gallery where DJ Arie 
Cole puts on some chill electro house 
EDM and see your world glow in neon 
colors.
At 9 p.m., it’s time for the highlight 
of the night: the new exhibition of 
Refik Anadol at Wood Street Galleries. 
However, before you get a chance to 
enjoy the exhibition, you find yourself 
in line outside the gallery, shivering in 
20°F, with voices in your head repeatedly 
questioning your devotion for art. But 
soon, you realize that even though the art 
is inside, you are surrounded by all kinds 
of interesting artists and art fanatics. 
With a curse on the weather, you break 
the ice. The graphic designers in front 
of you and rock enthusiasts behind you 
share insights on all the things about the 
local art scene that you’ve never heard of 
including their favorite shops, restaurants, 
and bars. The cold night and long line 
become less unbearable. You no longer 
long for the Infinity Room — the main 
attraction of the gallery — as the local 
artists have already overwhelmed you 
with all the passionate conversation.
“I really love the community vibe in 
the Pittsburgh art scene,” somebody 
behind you comments, and you nod 
wholeheartedly while letting the warm 
glow of local pride shelter you from the 
brutal late-night wind. As you step into 
the Infinity Room, light beams travel past 
you in the perfect precision of a carefully 
calculated algorithm. The mirrors above 
and below stretch your boxed reality 
into infinity. You are astonished by the 
magical creation of art and science, 
reluctant to even blink your eyes. At 10 
p.m., you end your fulfilling night with 
a three-minute experience of infinite 
beauty.

Cut to a pink spray-painted car with a “7” 
graffitied on its window. A crew of women 
in street-style fashion chill on the porch of a 
pink house drenched in bright neon purple 
and pink light. In the midst of it all is Ariana 
Grande, her frosty purple lipstick shining as 
bright as the diamonds on her neck.
A little over a month after her last release, 
“imagine,” pop princess Ariana Grande 
dropped her latest single and music video, 
“7 Rings.” Where “imagine” was a steamy 
song of wistful denial, “7 Rings” is a trap-
based reworking of “My Favorite Things” 
from The Sound of Music. Reminiscent of 
countless rappers, Grande flaunts her riches 
and a bad bitch energy.
But, like “imagine,” Grande has “borrowed” 
from Japanese culture and language for 
“7 Rings.” In the video, Japanese appears 
underneath the song title a few seconds 
into the video. The set is decorated with 
Japanese anime-like characters and bottles 
of sake, and blurred katakana flashes onto 
the screen at seemingly random intervals. 
The marketing for both songs utilized 
Japanese and a kind of Harajuku aesthetic, 
plastering Grande’s Instagram with captions 
in Japanese and the words “7 Rings” 
spelled out in katakana-looking English.
At first, with “imagine,” it seemed like 
Grande was simply taking inspiration from 
the neon, eccentric Harajuku culture, having 
taken lessons to learn Japanese for some 
time. While the song has nothing to do 
with Japanese culture (and the lyric video 
merely adopted a kind of glitchy vaporwave 
feel), my initial thought was, “How cool! A 
mainstream artist is using Japanese culture, 
this’ll help break down the idea that only 
weeaboos speak Japanese!”
But “7 Rings” is a whole different creature, 
essentially toeing the line between cultural 
appreciation and appropriation. Rather than 
feeling like a respectful appreciation for the 
culture, the marketing for “7 Rings” and the 
song itself felt like a blatant use of Japanese 
culture as a purely aesthetic accessory. 
The language was shaped to spell English 
words just to look cool, meant to project 
an anime-like kawaii (“cute” in Japanese) 
image. Grande has found immense success 
in cherry-picking the elements of Harajuku 
culture for her song — but this isn’t the first 
time she’s done this.
Ariana Grande's "7 Rings":
Toeing the line of Cultural Appreciation and Cultural Appropriation

---------------------------------------------------

This is part of a bigger problem — one 
more to add to Grande’s growing list of 
cultural misdemeanors. From the blatant 
darkness of her tan to her adoption of 
AAVE (African American Vernacular English) 
and a mimicry of a “blaccent,” Grande’s 
appropriation of black culture is consistent 
and unaddressed. She sings an old song: 
one of appropriating black culture to 
appear “edgy” or mature without any of the 
associated stereotypes or difficulties. We’ve 
seen it before with Iggy Azalea and Miley 
Cyrus; utilizing the style of black artists is a 
common trademark of white pop musicians 
seeking to project an image of maturity 
and growth — a movement away from 
sweet, innocent pop to something more 
raunchy and tough and “mature.” There 
is something inherently problematic with 
taking black stereotypes and using them to 
project an image of toughness, adultness, 
and sexual deviance, especially on such an 
enormous and visible platform. In the case 
of “7 Rings,” Grande has been accused 
of copying three black artists: 2 Chainz 
and his pink trap house aesthetic; 
Princess Nokia’s song “Mine,” a 
song that celebrates women of 
color and their relationship 
with their hair; and Soulja 
Boy’s flow from “Pretty 
Boy Swag,” a rap song 
with a chipped flow 
and choppy lyrics. 
The line “You like 
my hair, gee thanks, 
just bought it” in 
particular takes 
the complicated 
relationship 
between women 
of color and their 
hair and puts in the 
context of “flexing,” 
and Grande is 
praised for it whereas 
women of color are 
not. To be frank, this 
is a clear example of 
white privilege. White 
privilege is using Japanese 
culture as an accessory for the 
aesthetic and being praised for 
being “original.” White privilege is using 
black culture and sound without any actual 
repercussions of being black.
Now, all this isn’t to say we should “cancel” 
Ariana Grande or publicly shame her. For 
her, this past year was about as painful 
and sad as it can get, and piling on harsh 
critique is not kind nor is it right. As a 
longtime fan, I’ve found power in her 
transformation and marveled at her ability 
to emerge empathetic, loving, and kind. 
I’ve appreciated seeing her relate to and 
take inspiration from my culture — to be 
entirely honest, I was excited and happy. 
But this is not an excuse to continue 
appropriating people of color. As more of 
the public becomes more aware of Ariana 
Grande’s actions, I can only hope that, on 
the line between cultural appreciation and 
appropriation, that she leans more onto the 
former.

Coming to live in Pittsburgh turned 
me into a full-blown foodie. I always 
loved food growing up, but it wasn’t 
until I arrived in this eclectic city that I 
discovered so many cuisines 
from different places around 
the world, and even different 
variants of the same cuisine. 
Some restaurants are better 
than others, but I’m always 
excited to try new places. 
So, imagine my excitement 
when I discovered that a new 
restaurant opened in Oakland 
— just in time for the new 
semester.
CHiKN is nestled on Forbes 
Avenue in the heart of 
Oakland’s food scene, 
between Oakland Avenue 
and Atwood Street, neighboring popular 
establishments like Stack’d Burgers, Fuku 
Tea, and of course, McDonald’s. By the 
time I hit my sophomore year I had tried 
written by Marika Yang| Publisher

almost every restaurant in Oakland and 
have had to explore beyond this close 
neighborhood to satisfy my adventurous 
food cravings, but I’m always happy to 
walk these busy streets filled with Pitt 
and CMU students alike.
From its name, CHiKN’s food, style, and 
target demographic is self-explanatory. 
It’s a chicken restaurant that’s hip and 
modern, designed to appeal to the huge 
college market in Oakland. Walking 
inside, the decor and vibe are bright and 
contemporary, with wooden walls, 
floors, and furniture, bright lights 
hanging from the ceiling, and 
artificial plant installations. I went 
at lunchtime on a Saturday, and I 
was lucky to find a seat right away 
among all the student patrons, but 
the service was fast and friendly.
CHiKN has four main meal options 
on the menu: Sandwich, Tenders, 
Salad, and CHiKN & Waffles. They 
offer five spiciness levels, from 
none to spicy: Southern, Mild, 
Medium, Hot, and Damn Hot. I 
decided on the simplest (and in 
my opinion, the truest) way to 
judge a chicken restaurant: the chicken 
sandwich, with mild heat. I also tried the 
fries, which are a must with a chicken 
sandwich.
RESTAURANT REVIEW

---------------------------------------------------

It was delicious. They gave me a large 
piece of chicken, glistening fresh out 
of the fryer. Instead of the standard 
American burger toppings — lettuce, 
tomato, pickles — the sandwich was 
filled with coleslaw on a brioche bun. The 
freshness of the coleslaw balanced out 
the heat of the chicken really well. The 
fries were great too, soft on the inside 
but crispy on the outside. I’m excited to 
go back and try the CHiKN & Waffles, 
which seemed to be a very popular 
choice among the customers around me.
One tip: be aware of your spice 
tolerance. Every restaurant is different in 
how they rate spiciness, so if you’re not 
quite sure, I recommend going a level 
lower to keep a burning mouth from 
ruining your eating experience. If you’re 
one of those who needs some hot flavor 
to enjoy a chicken sandwich, there’s 
always the spicy sauce you can lather 
onto the bun.
Beyond the quality of the food itself (but 
it is the most important thing), having a 
fast and casual restaurant with a great 
atmosphere is something I think was 
missing from Oakland. There’s burgers, 
Thai, pizza, tacos, ice cream, Italian, 
Japanese, Korean — I could go on and 
on — but there wasn’t a place just for 
chicken.
“I think it’s a good addition for the 
food places on Forbes,” said junior 
mechanical and biomedical engineering 
major Mimi Li, who tried CHiKN’s 
chicken sandwich after hearing about 
the restaurant from a classmate. “I’ve 
been craving chicken and Chick-fil-A but 
it’s too far, and this is an even better 
version.”
CHiKN’s website is quite sparse at the 
time of writing and seems like a work 
in process, while their Instagram is new. 
I look forward to seeing where it goes. 
From my first experience, I think it’ll fit 
right in with the Oakland food scene.

Glitter. Glamour. Confidence.
Carnegie Mellon’s second annual Drag Bingo in McConomy Auditorium 
was nothing less than impressive. The event, hosted by SLICE and ALLIES, 
was fantastic. The line for the event went straight out the door, along the 
hallway and up the stairs to the second floor, and for good reason!
Upon entrance to the event, each audience member received two bingo 
cards that they would use to participate in the games. Double the fun and 
double the chance to win some prizes, with the small exception of a few 
lucky audience members, who got a lucky third card under their seats 
(shh)! Additionally, some yummy treats for snacking were provided by the 
hosts.
After taking a seat, the show proceeded, beginning with an introduction 
from senior business student Leo Galvan. Following the introduction, the 
moment everyone in the audience had been waiting for arrived: see-
ing Lola LeCroix, a Pittsburgh favorite, and Sharon Needles, winner of 
RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 4.
Lola LeCroix took the stage fiercely, with attitude and a phenomenal stage 
presence, dancing and having a great time entertaining the audience. 
Sharon Needles followed her. Both were equally incredible performances, 
with the crowd frequently erupted in cheers and clapping.
Keeping the night light and fun, Lola and Sharon recounted stories of their 
past performances and life experiences, roasted some special audience 
members and laughed along with everyone.
Games were played throughout the night with exciting prizes such as a 
coffee machine, travel voucher, Amazon gift card, restaurant gift cards, 
Carnegie Mellon School of Drama tickets, a mini speaker, and a Carnegie 
Mellon blanket!
Overall, it was a fantastic experience and night, and truly a wonderful time 
and an exciting event to take part in. Thank you to SLICE and ALLIES for 
hosting and inviting Lola and Sharon to perform!
It was FABULOUS!

Deciem founder Brandon Truaxe was found dead in Toronto, Canada on 
Jan. 21. The National Post reported that “it is understood he fell from a 
condominium building near Toronto’s downtown.” Truaxe’s boyfriend and 
current Deciem employee Riyadh Sweedan confirmed, stating, “I don’t 
think he jumped. I think he fell.” He was 40 years old.
The Ordinary’s approach to skincare was just as the name implied. 
Because it dedicates its budget to research and development instead of
traditional marketing, the low price tag and the simple, almost
pharmaceutical-looking packaging that houses the product don’t appear to 
be much. However, The Ordinary is able to pump out inexpensive products 
that got both everyday skincare fanatics and online influencers singing 
praises.
The Ordinary is a brand owned by 
skincare company Deciem, both
founded by former CEO Brandon 
Truaxe, who was born Ali Roshan. 
Although Deciem has been successful 
holistically, The Ordinary has earned 
the most critical acclaim. The company 
prides itself in being “the abnormal 
beauty company.” Deciem sells their 
products at a mere fraction of its
competitor’s prices, baffling both 
everyday skincare aficionados and 
online beauty gurus alike. Seemingly 
every review online expresses disbelief 
that a product could blow drugstore 
prices out of the water yet perform 
on-par with luxury brands. “If we 
have one goal as a group, it’s to add 
accountability to the beauty business. 
People assume it’s a scam, but the 
world evolves and things get better 
and better,” Truaxe is quoted on the 
front page.
However, things quickly took a turn. 
Throughout 2018, founder and then-
CEO Brandon Truaxe had an unnerv-
ing presence on The Ordinary’s 
Instagram profile, so much so that 
his usage of Instagram had been likened to President Donald Trump’s 
erratic usage of Twitter. Controversies ranged from disrespecting users 
in Instagram comments to allegedly insinuating a dark-skinned customer 
bleach her skin to posting troubling videos on Instagram saying “almost 
everyone at Deciem has been involved in a major criminal activity, which 
includes financial crimes and much others... it’s all ending now.”
In response to the spiraling series of controversies, the Internet did what it 
appears to do best: publicly boycott the brand. “Anti-haul” videos, those 
where certain influencers and consumers explain what and why they will 
not be purchasing certain products or products from certain brands, added 
Deciem’s brand to their list. Some former consumers posted videos of them 
burning their Deciem products in protest. In May, Sephora, which had 
previously carried The Ordinary’s products, silently pulled the products off 
their online shelves despite the products’ wild success. Ultimately, Truaxe 
was cut off from Deciem on Oct. 12, 2018. The website and stores were 
closed down until Oct. 15. Since then, the company picked up where it left 
off. Both online and brick-and-mortar stores have been running since, and 
Sephora started phasing The Ordinary back in stock starting December.
However, removing Truaxe from Deciem was not enough to remove him as 
a controversial figure. On Oct. 20, he posted screenshots of graphic and 
threatening emails he had sent to one of Deciem’s earliest shareholders, 
Estee Lauder. “I’ll be in your hometown in a few hours,” the email read. 
“Please advise if you prefer silicone-based or water-based lubricants for 
my approach into your criminal, destructive c***s, for the most politically-
correct wording. You have now illegally removed access to my phone, 
email, and social channels. I’m confident that you know the world will have 
never seen a downfall greater than 
that of the fraudulent empire ELC, the 
Lauder family, and those related have 
built.” Consequently, the brand filed a 
restraining order against Truaxe, which 
was successful. Truaxe later admitted 
that the email sent was “admittedly 
very impolite” and that he was “very 
angry and confused.”
Even while the series of events were 
unraveling, it was clear that Truaxe 
was a troubled man. Although he 
denied having problems with his
mental health, the Financial Post 
shared Truaxe’s history of psychiatric 
hospitalization and diagnosis as psy-
chotic and presumptive bipolar disor-
der. Additionally, doctors in London 
revealed that Truaxe was receiving 
treatment for abuse of crystal meth 
and magic mushrooms. The eccentricity 
that once created Deciem’s success ulti-
mately led to his partners considering 
him “a liability.”
After a tumultuous 2018, it appears 
Deciem will spend 2019 recovering. 
Although I watched Truaxe’s mental 
health deteriorate from afar, seeing the news pop up on my beauty chatter 
forums came as a massive shock. However, the company did themselves 
and him a disservice by trying to treat the consequences of Truaxe’s mental 
illnesses as a general PR crisis. Furthermore, the online realm of beauty 
seemed to gorge in what was considered “drama.” Drama channels 
would “spill the tea” on the issue, laughing at Truaxe’s mental instability. 
Watching the responses without context, an outsider might be left to believe 
that they were watching gossip spread in a high school movie. Although 
Truaxe was receiving help, the worldwide lack of mental health resources 
and awareness failed him. That all being said, Truaxe’s behavior was 
inexcusable in various instances and should not be condoned. However, 
I hope that this can serve as a reminder of how much work needs to be 
done in understanding the human mind, both in the medical and humanitar-
ian sense.

TOP 5:
The Best and WorstMovies of 2018
Roma, 
directed by Alfonso Cuaron
10/10
This film is one of the best films I’ve seen 
in a long time. It’s a beautiful, neorealist 
masterpiece. Set in Mexico during the 1970s, 
it follows the life of a maid in a middle-class 
family over the course of the year. Cuaron’s 
style is perfect for the simple, “slice of life” style 
of story. He communicates the character’s 
struggles through the environment, with the 
camera keenly observing every detail in the 
frame. Practically every detail, performance, 
and technical aspect are on point. There is so 
much effort put in everything, right down to 
the fully immersive sound design. This is clearly 
a passion project for Cuaron and it shows. It 
is easily the best film of the year, and it’s also 
on Netflix, so there is zero reason to not check 
it out.
First Reformed,
directed by Paul Schrader
10/10
From the writer of Taxi Driver comes another 
carefully paced, methodical, dark character 
study about a religious man slowly going 
down the path of extremism. The film barely 
has any camera movement. It presents itself 
with a 4:3 aspect ratio and it is filmed with 
mostly still shots to create a sense of how 
trapped the main character feels. Ethan 
Hawke gives his best performances ever, 
and it’s extremely subtle and makes you feel 
for his character. If you like dark character 
dramas that tackle heady themes like religious 
and political corruption, then check this film 
out.
Hereditary, 
directed by Ari Aster
10/10
This film is messed up. If you cannot stomach 
psychological horror or disturbing films, 
don’t watch this film. For anyone else who 
is interested in that, this is a really effective 
horror film about a family slowly going 
insane after a few tragedies. It is an excellent 
exploration of the toll grief and mental illness 
have on a family. There are zero jump scares, 
and all the horror is derived from atmosphere, 
tension, and dread. This is one of the best 
horror films in a long time, and if you’re a fan 
of the genre, watch this as soon as possible.
The Favourite, 
directed by Yorgos 
Lanthimos
9/10
Yorgos Lanthimos is now one of the best new 
directors working today, with his previous films 
The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer 
making my top ten in their respective years. 
His latest film is the best of the bunch. It’s a 
historical comedy about two women playing 
mind games with the Queen to win her favor. 
The comedy is unconventional, filled with 
pans, fisheye lens shots, snappy dialogue, 
and quirky performances. This was a highly 
entertaining, beautiful, and fascinating film, 
and I would recommend this to anyone who 
wants an interesting period piece to watch.
Spider-Man: Into the 
Spider-verse, 
directed by Bob Persichetti, 
Peter Ramsey, and Rodney 
Rothman
9/10
Now here is a film I didn’t expect to even 
crack my top ten, let alone my top five. But 
yet, Into the Spider-verse blew my expectations 
and hype out of the water with one of the 
best animated films of recent memory. It’s 
easily the best Spider-Man film that has been 
made, with an unparalleled understanding 
of the character that does so in an original 
and interesting way. Pretty much all the visual 
humor and dialogue had me in stitches. The 
story had a lot of stakes and danger to it, 
with the villains having a very threatening 
presence. The multiple Spider-people were all 
fantastic, and their dynamic was really fun to 
watch. Aside from two musical choices during 
some sad scenes, the music choices were all 
fantastic. It’s just a fun, entertaining, and well-
rounded film overall that can be enjoyed by 
anyone.

BOTTOM 5:
A Wrinkle in Time, 
directed by Ava Duvernay
1/10
Good god. This film was like watching 
money burn. It’s an embarrassing 
contribution to the U.S. GDP, and I can’t 
believe I paid money to watch this in a 
theater. Did Disney just think that they 
could hire someone who hasn’t read 
a beloved book and never made an 
adventure/sci-fi film before to churn out 
this piece of garbage? Everything about 
this was wrong. The child actors made me 
want to gouge my eyes out. The visual 
effects were cheap. The film just felt lazy, 
like there was no effort put into it. This 
is one of the worst big budget films I’ve 
ever seen, and I’d recommend this to film 
teachers to show their students how not to 
make a film.
Robin Hood,
directed by Otto Bathurst
1/10
I mentioned this in a previous review 
already. I had snuck into this film after 
watching Creed II, and left after half an 
hour because it was so gloriously awful. 
This was one of those films that makes me 
question Hollywood and the executives 
who greenlight these productions. The 
industry is already making less money 
than normal. How about they greenlight 
something good and original that people 
would actually want to watch instead of 
these half-baked remakes?
Insidious: The Last Key,
directed by Adam Robitel
1/10
Anyone who found this film scary must 
also find paint drying to be a visceral 
experience. There isn’t much to say about 
this film. It’s not scary. It’s not funny. It’s 
not tense. It’s not disturbing. It’s just not 
horror. I hope this is the last film in this 
lame franchise.
Death Wish, 
directed by Eli Roth
1/10
Eli Roth is a hack, and he is only good 
when Tarantino is directing him. He tries 
to emulate Tarantino’s style to a certain 
degree, but it never works because he has 
zero talent. Also, has Bruce Willis given 
up on trying to act? It seems like he just 
does movies nowadays to show that he 
still exists. Gone are the days of Die Hard, 
Pulp Fiction, and Unbreakable, where he 
used to actually emote and care about 
the films he did. On top of that, the film 
is so tone deaf. It doesn’t know whether it 
wants to be an homage to pulpy thrillers 
from the 70s or whether it wants to be a 
social statement about modern violence. 
Normally this wouldn’t matter, but it tries, 
for some odd reason, to be both and 
it fails completely. I’m ashamed that I 
watched this.
Fifty Shades Freed,
directed by James Foley
1/10
While we are on the subject of being 
ashamed, I watched this piece of garbage 
too. This is the antithesis of The Lord of the 
Rings trilogy. While that trilogy is pretty much 
perfect and will be remembered for how 
amazing it is, this trilogy is the exact opposite, 
where every entry is a disaster. Each sequel 
is 100 times worse than the previous one, 
which makes Fifty Shades Freed 10000 
times worse than the first one. This is not 
an exaggeration. Nothing happens in this 
film. The characters fight. They engage in 
bland intercourse. Then they go to another 
location. There is some kidnapping subplot in 
there somewhere. There’s a car chase that’s 
basically Audi product placement. Worst of 
all, this film portrays a really dangerous and 
unhealthy relationship with no redeemable 
characters. It actually angers me how badly 
the relationship is portrayed. It’s not just that 
the characters have no chemistry. It’s an 
abusive relationship and the film portrays 
it like a fairy tale, and it’s unhealthy and 
insulting. Anyone who finds that stimulating 
frankly needs to see a therapist. Thank 
god this trilogy is over, and we all should 
celebrate its end.

---------------------------------------------------

On the title track of James Blake’s fourth album Assume Form, the British producer and auteur sings, “I can already see that this goes deeper.” Blake 
asks a series of questions on the opener that structure an album filled to the brim with interesting ideas, while exhibiting a degree of restraint that sets 
the project apart from his previous work. Blake’s heightened influence over hip-hop production has made its way back to his solo work, as contributions 
from Travis Scott, Metro Boomin, and the elusive André 3000 feel unique to both genres. If 2016’s The Colour in Anything was the last you heard from 
James Blake, Assume Form will come across as a substantial left turn. Even if you followed his misadventures in pop-rap projects since, there is no
shortage of surprises here, in production and lyrics alike. For all that novelty, the listener is left wondering whether Blake understands exactly how deep 
his feelings go, or if his lack of understanding is the point.
Across numerous tracks, how Blake explores being in love seems to exist on a surface level. Assume Form, though, is selfish in the way a recluse can be 
in sharing so much of themselves in a relationship. Blake captures a self-indulgent, self-centered perspective of love that many will roll their eyes at. To 
debate the merits of that mindset deserves its own article, and numerous think-pieces have already tackled the matter. Even if Blake’s ego is unoriginal, 
his music maintains singularity.
The most notable disappointments on the record are the collaborations with Metro Boomin and Travis Scott. They are far from unlistenable, and certainly 
could crack the charts given the superstar appeal of Blake’s collaborators, but they feel especially stagnant on so varied a tracklist. Even Moses Sumney 
— whose voice and style match Blake’s perfectly on paper — can’t save this leg of the album. In the context of this album, they seem out of place. They 
bring an upbeat core to the first leg but have little impact on the entirety of the project.
Even if Assume Form is far from the intense darkness of Colour, Blake still crafts a cerebral atmosphere. At points, it feels almost sarcastic. On “Where’s 
the Catch,” Blake sings “everything’s roses” over a droning, march-like beat. Even so, the track is vibrant and punchy in a way similar to “Timeless” off 
Colour. André 3000’s appearance is brilliant, as usual. It feels like the perfect emcee feature for a James Blake record. Towards the end of the track, 
André and Blake’s voices mesh in a mesmerizing, glitchy maze. It is some of Blake’s best production.
Blake casts a wry image of self-doubt on “Where’s the Catch,” a feeling which surfaces a few times on the record, most notably on “Are You in Love.” 
That track captures a more typical James Blake sound. Part cascading electronica and part love-sick anthem, it is squarely in Blake’s wheelhouse while 
maintaining the thematic departure. He sings: “I promise you your place is safe. Now what about mine?” The listener — and Blake’s partner — could
easily be frustrated by so demanding an ask. In the context of the album, though, the intentions of “Are You in Love” seem deliberate.

JAMES BLAKE

---------------------------------------------------

That frustration, though, is part of what makes Assume Form work. It would be jarring and disingenuous for Blake to portray his relation-
ship as impervious, or to imply his struggles with mental health were washed away because of a profound connection. This album is Blake 
pushing himself to accept the truth of his present situation. The darkest corners of his mind were not erased overnight on some given day 
between 2016 and now. Blake — and, presumably, his partner — are casting light into those corners, together.
Most the project seems to be wrapped in self-critique. It is equal parts cynical and tongue-in-cheek. Blake’s self-loathing washes away on 
“I’ll Come Too” and “Power On,” with the former tinged in sarcasm and the latter blunt self-indictment. On “I’ll Come Too,” Blake inhabits 
the most possessive recesses of his mind. He follows his partner around the world, using his success to change plans on a whim. It comes 
across as creepy, but “Power On” serves to explicitly clarify his nature. Admittedly, the straightforward lyricism makes the listener long for 
a more mysterious Blake. “Don’t Miss It” is similarly transparent to a fault, but more successful in conveying Blake’s regrets for his behavior, 
and how he affected those around him. While imperfect, the track feels like a natural conclusion to the British crooner’s arc.
Album closer “Lullaby for My Insomniac” is an ethereal epilogue. Blake speaks directly to his sleepless partner and embodies whatever new 
version of himself he has wrestled with on the album. It is rather fitting that James Blake’s happy ending is impossibly melancholy, as his 
voice rings alone, and he drifts off, content.

Black Panther, one of Marvel’s three movies released in 2018, earned over 
$1 billion at the box office, making it the world’s ninth highest grossing 
film of all time. Now, it’s up for seven Oscar nominations, a new high for 
the Marvel Cinematic Universe and superhero movies alike. It’s the first 
superhero movie to get a Best Picture nod from the Academy, but is it 
well deserved? Could Black Panther actually win Best Picture at the 91st 
Academy Awards? Here are a few reasons why it should.
Unlike the other superhero movies of the franchise, Black Panther is repre-
sentation that’s been long overdue. The movie isn’t just a CGI driven pummel 
fest; it provokes conversations about race, gender equality, and prejudice without 
taking itself too seriously. The powerful women the film portrayed shatter gender 
norms Marvel still hadn’t quite breached through until that point. Nakia, a fiery 
woman so much more than T’Challa’s companion, Shuri, the genius behind the 
suit, and the Dora Milaje, the king’s guard, are some of the strongest female roles 
Marvel has ever produced. These women held their own in battle and put work 
and ambition before men and love, and it was empowering to watch.
As for the racial connotations of the film, it provides an interesting outlook on
dealing with racism in today’s world with its excellent characterization of both 
T’Challa and Killmonger, a fan favorite villain. Killmonger carries the sentiment of 
empowering all developing nations by providing them with the unlimited
weapons Wakanda possesses. Hardened by his years in the war and his father’s 
early death, he sees the solution to racial inequality as more destruction. It’s what 
made him an incredible villain. He is a complete contrast to T’Challa, who puts 
Wakanda above all and refuses to believe violence is the answer. They’re both 
flawed in their approach to dealing with racial inequality in the world. Despite the 
fact that the movie ends with Killmonger’s death, T’Challa learns from Killmonger 
and opens Wakanda to the world, ultimately making T’Challa a superhero
completely worth looking up to. The fact that the movie captured this character 
development brilliantly, without sacrificing its heroics and stunts, makes it a master-
piece well deserving of its Oscar nomination.
Black Panther is by no means a flawless movie, but it meant something for many 
people who watched it, breaking ground simply for what it tried to do. The 
execution wasn’t perfect; the film lost its humor here and there, and it killed 
one of Marvel’s best villains since Loki. Despite that, it’s enough to be 
deserving of its nomination even without the “Popular Film” category the 
Academy tried to introduce and promptly postponed. What does this 
mean for future superhero movies, or in more general terms, commer-
cial blockbusters? Black Panther paves the way for more popcorn 
films to get prestigious awards recognition, and the repercussions of 
this are something only time will tell.
Black Panther made millions through its popularity, but its seven 
Academy Award nominations aren’t just about that. It’s about what 
this movie meant to people. If other commercial blockbusters in 
the future can carry a message as important as this movie, a 
nod from the Academy for them would be befitting.
SHOULD BLACK PANTHER
WIN Best Picture?

---------------------------------------------------

Room retention
Room retention, the first phase, is for students planning to retain their current room for 
the next school year. Although there are some exceptions, room retention is available to 
most upperclass students, except those in themed housing, a first-year residence hall or 
apartment, or an RA/CA room. First-year students are not eligible to retain their rooms, 
regardless of their room location. Students considering room retention should remember 
that once they retain, they cannot change or cancel their housing assignment until the 
open cancellation period begins.
Room with a retainer
Students retaining their rooms during the first phase are required to fill any vacancies 
in the room, suite, or apartment with “pull-ins.” In order to be “pulled in” to a room, 
students must be eligible to participate in Room Selection and must not have already 
selected an assignment for the school year.
Block housing
The block housing phase of room selection allows groups of students to select a 
“block” of rooms near each other in one of the applicable residence halls or apartments. 
Students electing to apply for block housing must identify a group representative who 
will be responsible for setting up their block housing group on the housing application 
and will remain the main contact point between the group and Housing Services.
General room selection
General Room Selection is the final phase of Room Selection. During this phase, 
students eligible for housing who haven’t participated in the preceding phases choose 
a room from the remaining spaces. Students planning to participate in general Room 
Selection must apply online. They are then given a random timeslot for Room Selection.
Themed housing
Themed housing allows students to apply for housing centered around a certain 
interest or theme. Themed houses are detailed on page six of this guide.
RA/CA housing
RA/CA housing is only available for those students holding an RA or CA position during 
the 2019-2020 school year. These students will not be eligible to participate in Room 
Selection, and will instead be assigned a room through the application and selection 
process carried out by the Office of Residential Education.
Gender inclusive housing
Gender inclusive housing permits upper-class residents of different genders to reside in 
the same room. 
Open assignments
Due to fluctuating availability in room assignments, some students are given an 
open assignment. This means that while they are guaranteed a room for the 2018–19 
academic year, they will not immediately know where that room will be located, or 
what style of room they will be assigned. After receiving an open assignment, students 
wait until they receive an offer for a room for the upcoming year. After receiving their 
offer, they can decline the offer and cancel their housing agreement within three days 
without penalty, even if the offer was made after the open cancellation period ends.
For more details about the Room Selection process, visit  
www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection.
Room Selection offers students several options: room retention, room with a retainer (also known as a “pull-in”), block 
housing, general room selection, themed housing, RA/CA housing, gender inclusive housing, and open assignments.
Most students will participate in one of three Room Selection choices: room retention, room with a retainer, or general room 
selection. However, a wide variety of housing options is available to all students. Room Selection begins on Feb. 20, so all 
students returning next year should be actively thinking about their housing plans for the 2019–2020 school year.

Room Type Changes
As part of the Housing Master plan and in order to align with national housing room type 
naming standards, Carnegie Mellon Housing Services is updating the names of its room 
types. There are no changes in room rate or building name – only the room type name 
will change. 
Doherty Apartments Available for Fall 2019 Only
Doherty will only be available for occupancy for the fall 2019 semester, as it will close in 
December 2019 for future new construction plans. If you are graduating in December

BE PART OF CAMPUS HOUSING. THE BUILDING INCLUDES LAUNDRY FACILITIES, AIR CONDITIONING, BIKE STOR-

JUST A 10-TO-15-MINUTE WALK (OR FIVE-MINUTE BUS RIDE) FROM CAMPUS LIES OAKLAND, THE 
HOME OF LATE-NIGHT FOOD, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH PRIDE, AND A POPULATION MADE UP 
ALMOST ENTIRELY OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. 
OAKLAND IS HOME TO SOME OF CARNEGIE MELLON STUDENTS’ FAVORITE RESTAURANTS, INCLUDING 
CONFLICT KITCHEN, CHIPOTLE, FUEL AND FUDDLE, AND THE PORCH. FOR STUDENTS OVER 21, 
OAKLAND HAS A SOLID GROUP OF LATE-NIGHT DESTINATIONS, SUCH AS HEMINGWAY’S, MAD 
MEX, AND A LIQUOR STORE WITH AN EXTENSIVE SELECTION. ANOTHER BENEFIT OF OAKLAND IS THE 
AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CLOSE TO CAMPUS. OAKLAND AVENUE AND ATWOOD STREET 
ARE LINED WITH HOUSING FOR BOTH CARNEGIE MELLON AND UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH STUDENTS.
MOST PEOPLE LIVING HERE ARE ALWAYS UP FOR FUN; IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A QUIET 
NEIGHBORHOOD, OAKLAND MAY NOT BE YOUR CUP OF TEA. OAKLAND SHOULD BE NOTED FOR ITS 
LIVELY ATMOSPHERE AND IS IDEAL FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR COLLEGE-ORIENTED SURROUNDINGS.
OAKLAND
SHADYSIDE IS HOME TO UPPERCLASSMEN FROM CARNEGIE MELLON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF 
PITTSBURGH, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND YOUNG WORKING PROFESSIONALS. ACCESSIBLE BY BUS, IT 
TENDS TO BE SLIGHTLY PRICIER THAN OAKLAND OR SQUIRREL HILL; HOWEVER, IT IS THE MOST CHARMING OF 
THE AREAS SURROUNDING CAMPUS, WITH ITS TREE-LINED STREETS AND BOUTIQUES. THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
IS BEST KNOWN FOR TWO THINGS: SHOPS AND BARS. WALNUT STREET IS LINED WITH A WIDE VARIETY 
OF SHOPS, AND COZY RESTAURANTS LIKE MERCURIO’S AND THE YARD GASTROPUB ARE INTERSPERSED 
AMONG THE SHOPS.
WHILE THE AREA NEAR SHADYSIDE’S BARS CAN BE PARTICULARLY LOUD FROM THURSDAY TO SUNDAY, 
SHADYSIDE IS GENERALLY A VERY RELAXED, QUIET AREA. THE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND THE COLLEGE 
STUDENTS WHO LIVE THERE ARE DIVERSE  — FROM ARTISTS TO TECHNICAL MAJORS TO MEDICAL STUDENTS. 
SHADYSIDE IS A GREAT AREA FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR EITHER AN ESCAPE FROM CAMPUS OR A POPULAR 
SHOPPING AND NIGHTLIFE EXPERIENCE.

NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODSHOUSING GUIDE
SQUIRREL HILL STARTS JUST UP THE BIG HILL ON FORBES AVENUE. IT IS EITHER A 20-MINUTE WALK 
OR A THREE-MINUTE BUS RIDE FROM CAMPUS, AND THE BUSES ARE VERY FREQUENT. THE COST OF 
LIVING IN SQUIRREL HILL IS HIGHER THAN IN OAKLAND, BUT LOWER THAN IN SHADYSIDE. IN ADDITION 
TO HOUSING UPPERCLASS STUDENTS FROM CARNEGIE MELLON, SQUIRREL HILL IS ALSO HOME TO 
FACULTY AND PITTSBURGH FAMILIES NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY. SQUIRREL HILL HAS A 
DIVERSITY OF RESTAURANTS, FROM THAI FOOD AT SILK ELEPHANT TO BREAKFAST AT THE ORIGINAL 
PAMELA’S DINER. THE RESTAURANTS ARE DISPERSED AMONG SMALL SHOPS, INCLUDING THOSE ON 
THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE OF FORBES AVENUE.
IT IS NOT A COLLEGE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE OAKLAND AND SHADYSIDE, AND IT DOES NOT HAVE A 
PROMINENT BAR SCENE. IT DOES HAVE A RESIDENTIAL ATMOSPHERE, HOWEVER, THAT THE OTHER 
TWO AREAS LACK. FOR SOMEONE LOOKING FOR A SHORT RIDE OR WALK FROM CAMPUS WITH ALL THE 
NECESSITIES WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE AND A WIDE VARIETY OF CUISINES, SQUIRREL HILL MAY 
BE THE RIGHT PLACE TO LOOK FOR A HOME TO RENT.

Sujay Utkarsh | Pillbox Editormovies in McConomy 
This week, there are two tense dramas being screened in McConomy.
31
This film is about a gay son of a Baptist preacher who is forced to go to a conversion therapy camp after being outed. It’s 
a very tense, well-acted drama that is unfortunately relevant. The claim can be made that the film is a little manipulative, but 
given the premise, it is handled in a way that isn’t too cheesy or overdramatic. The film is fairly grounded, even if the story is 
admittedly predictable. Check this one out on Saturday, but don’t go in expecting an uplifting experience.
Boy Erased
Widows
This film was reviewed in the November movies wrap-up in a previous edition, but this is a very unconventional heist drama. The 
film follows four widows who have to repay a debt left behind by their husbands by pulling off the last heist. With a story as 
dense and expansive as this, there is always the threat of the film feeling unfocused and lost. However, this is one of the tightest 
scripts from last year, with each subplot and element connecting back to the main plot in some way. The twists felt organic and 
unpredictable, and the character drama and dynamics were really interesting to watch. Every performance was great. The final 
heist, while short, was satisfying. It’s just an entertaining character piece, and check this one out on Friday or Sunday.
Friday, Feb. 1 
Sunday, Feb. 3 
Saturday, Feb. 2
