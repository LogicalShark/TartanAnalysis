The National Endowment 
for the Humanities (NEH) 
Grant has recently been 
awarded to Six Degrees of 
Francis Bacon, an app that 
traces the social constructs 
of the British early modern 
era. The app received the 
Digital Humanities Award 
of $325,000, which is one of 
300 new grants bestowed by 
the NEH. With this grant, the 
already successful network 
now has the potential to grow 
even further and become 
more successful as the grant 
will hopefully allow more 
connections to be uncovered.
The app was created by 
Christopher Warren, an as-
sistant professor in Carnegie 
Mellon’s English department, 
Jessica Otis, a faculty mem-
ber in Carnegie Mellon’s Uni-
versity Libraries-Research 
department, and Daniel 
Shore, an associate profes-
sor of English at Georgetown 
University. They created it us-
ing the Oxford Dictionary of 
Natural Biography as the ba-
sis for establishing relation-
ships between notable people 
of the British early modern 
era. 
Warren, Otis, and Shore 
were also advised by Cosma 
Shalizi, an associate profes-
sor in Carnegie Mellon’s sta-
tistics department, Lawrence 
Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in 
Carnegie Mellon’s statistics 
department, and others from 
the department of statistics in 
creating the social network. 
Information systems 
teaching professor Raja 
Sooriamurthi and his stu-
dents also contributed. Their 
contributions allow any users 
to add information to the app 
in a way that resembles the 
information crowdsourcing 
of Wikipedia.
Because anyone can con-
tribute to the website, the 
app has potential to grow. As 
it grows, it creates an even 
larger web of connections. 
Receiving the NEH Grant 
will facilitate this growth 
as the team aims to improve 
the website’s quality and 
accessibility. 
The website, as it stands, 
consists of a giant web of 
names that all connect back 
to Francis Bacon.
 For example, if you need-
ed to know if Jane Austen 
knew Michael Faraday, the 
app would show you the ac-
quaintances they had in com-
mon and how those people 
were connected. 
Grey and red nodes on the 
website denote those with 
the least connections in the 
1500–1700 period, while 
blue nodes sprout several 
connections. The common

On July 1, Carnegie Mellon 
University’s Hunt Institute for 
Botanical Documentation ap-
pointed a new director, T.D. 
Jacobsen, following the retire-
ment of the previous director, 
Robert Kiger. 
Jacobsen joined the staff of 
Hunt Institute in 1979 and has 
served as assistant director 
and principal research scien-
tist for the Hunt Institute since 
1980. Jacobsen is the fourth 
director since the inaugura-
tion of the Institute in 1961.
The Hunt Institute for Bo-
tanical Documentation is a 
research division of Carnegie 
Mellon University that special-
izes in botany and the history 
of plant science. Initially dedi-
cated as the Rachel McMas-
ters Miller Hunt Botanical Li-
brary in 1961, the institution’s 
growth and diversi?cation in 
activities led to a revision of its 
name ten years later, as well as 
the establishment of four de-
partments: archives, art, bibli-
ography, and the library. 
Today, the Hunt Institute 
serves an “international sci-
enti?c community through 
research and documentation,” 
according to its website. Its 
collections include artwork, 
data ?les, archives, and books.
With a B.S. in biology from 
the College of Idaho and an 
M.S. and Ph.D. in systematic 
botany from Washington State 
University, T.D. Jacobsen has 
become an authority on vascu-
lar taxonomy, toxic plants, and 
fungi through his research. 
He has a particular interest 
in the systematics of the genus 
Allium, which encompasses 
onions, garlic, and other re-
lated species. 
His previous work includes 
collaborating with a team of 
scientists at the Pittsburgh 
Poison Center to develop a 
computer application for iden-
tifying more than 325 native 
and exotic North American 
vascular plant genera. 
Another of Jacobsen’s 
projects was an investigation 
of pediatric plant poisoning, 
which was conducted in col-
laboration with the director of 
the Pittsburgh Poison Center, 
Edward P. Krenzelok.
Before Jacobsen’s transi-
tion to director this summer, 
the Robert W. Kiger served as 
director of Hunt Institute for 
39 years.

On Aug. 1, Rebecca Do-
erge, professor of statistics 
and biological sciences at 
Carnegie Mellon University 
was welcomed as the newly 
appointed dean of the Mel-
lon College of Science (MCS). 
Doerge will be taking over 
the position from Fred Gil-
man, the Buhl Professor of 
Theoretical Physics, who has 
been serving as dean of MCS 
for nine years since his initial 
appointment as acting dean 
on Sept. 1, 2007 before his of-
?cial appointment on April 1, 
2008.
Before her time at Carn-
egie Mellon, Doerge was a 
professor at Purdue Univer-
sity where she held positions 
in Purdue’s College of Ag-
riculture and its College of 
Science. 
Doerge’s combined pas-
sion for statistics and the bio-
logical sciences is apparent in 
her research, which focuses 
on statistical bioinformat-
ics and seeks to develop a 
more thorough understand-
ing of DNA and epigenomic 
associations. 
Since joining Purdue Uni-
versity in 1995, Doerge has 
authored more than 120 sci-
enti?c articles and two books, 
Statistics at the Bench: A Step-
by-Step Handbook for Biolo-
gists and Using R at the Bench: 
Step-by-Step Data Analytics 
for Biologists, both of which 
were co-authored with Marti-
na Bremer, a professor in the 
Department of Mathematics 
at San Jose State University.
Doerge was appointed as 
the head of Purdue Univer-
sity’s Department of Statistics 
from 2010–2015. During this 
time her skills facilitated the 
department’s growth into one 
of the best the country. 
A university press release 
reported that as department 
head, she not only “doubled 
both the number of under-
graduate students and the 
number of tenured female 
faculty,” but also “[increased] 
the department’s number 
of online and hybrid course 
offerings.”
 Her work at Purdue Uni-
versity earned her the honor 
of being named the Trent 
and Judith Anderson Distin-
guished Professor of Statistics 
at the university.
In an email to The Tar-
tan, Doerge shared her en-
thusiasm and pride in being 
appointed to the position of 
dean in the Mellon College of 
Science, one of seven colleges 
that plays a vital role in the 
multi-disciplinary nature of 
Carnegie Mellon University.

sity’s focus on educating the 
whole student [body] across 
disciplinary boundaries is 
essential for addressing soci-
etal and global challenges,”

The summer of 2016 has 
been ?lled with many high 
and low moments. 
Highlights include the 
2016 summer Olympics, 
which is now coming to an 
end with the U.S. dominat-
ing several major events 
such as swimming and 
gymnastics. The presiden-
tial election has also been 
heating up with the Demo-
cratic and Republican Na-
tional Conventions that 
took place last month. 
Among the various 
events that have been mak-
ing news headlines across 
the country was the shoot-
ing of black civilians in the 
cities of Minneapolis, Min-
nesota and Baton Rogue, 
Louisiana as well as sniper 
attacks that targeted po-
lice of?cers in Dallas, TX. 
Spanning over the course 
of three days, these events 
have taken the lives of 
and injured many of those 
involved.
Aware of the toll this 
has taken on the country 
and the effect this has been 
having on many of its stu-
dents, Carnegie Mellon 
released a statement over 
the summer addressing the 
impact of these events on 
its students and the uni-
versity’s stance on the sur-
rounding con?ict.
“Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity shares the nation’s 
distress over recent shoot-
ings in Dallas, Minneapo-
lis, and Baton Rouge,” the 
press release stated. “Our 
hearts go out to the vic-
tims and their loved ones, 
and all those touched by 
violence.”
The events of the sum-
mer add to the big-picture 
conversations of race ten-
sions and gun violence that 
have been highly publi-
cized recently in the media 
between black civilians and 
police of?cers.
These recent events 
follow the shootings of 
Michael Brown, Trayvon 
Martin, and Eric Garner 
to name only a few. The 
names of Alton Sterling 
and Philando Castile have 
now also been made known 
to the nation.
 On Tuesday July 5, Al-
ton Sterling, a black man, 
was fatally shot by police 
in front of a convenience 
store in Baton Rouge, LA. 
The very next day Philando 
Castile, another black man, 
was fatally shot in Minne-
sota after being pulled over 
by police.
These back to back 
events have caused out-
rage, not only because they

Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity in Qatar alumna Nada 
Arajki made history again 
this summer at the Olympic 
Games in Rio de Janeiro, Bra-
zil.
In 2012, as a ?rst-year 
student, Arajki travelled to 
London and became the ?rst 
female to represent Qatar, 
competing in the 50-meter 
freestyle.
 This year, returning to 
show in the 100-meter but-
ter?y race, she has of?cially 
become the only woman in 
Qatar history to compete in 
two Olympic Games.
According to CMU News 
Arajki was “proud and hap-
py” to make history in 2012, 
but this year, she hoped to 
channel her experience and 
training to improve upon 
her personal best time. Ara-
kji completed the 100-meter 
freestyle heat in one minute 
and 18.86 seconds, ranking 
at number 45.
Alajki graduated from 
CMU-Q’s business adminis-
tration program in May 2016, 
also serving as this year’s stu-
dent speaker at commence-
ment.
She admitted that balanc-
ing swimming with her aca-
demics was often a challenge, 
but for what she loves, noth-
ing could get in the way.
Alajki hopes to join the 
Qatar Olympic Committee to 
continue developing athletics 
in the country’s future.

Carnegie Mellon wins third World Series of Hacking competition
This August, Carnegie 
Mellon’s competitive cyber-
security team, the Plaid Par-
liament of Pwning, earned 
its third title in four years at 
the “World Series of Hack-
ing,” the DefCon Capture the 
Flag competition.
The team, led by electri-
cal and computer engineer-
ing faculty and director of 
CyLab Security and Privacy 
Insitute, David Brumley, 
traveled to Las Vegas, Nev. 
for the contest from Aug. 
6-8.
The Plaid Parliament of 
Pwning was just one of 15 
teams to qualify to compete 
at DefCon. At the Capture 
the Flag competitions, teams 
try to break into each others’ 
servers to catch “?ags” while 
continuing to defend their 
own server.
Brumley said in an inter-
view to CMU News that as 
the competition continues 
to get more dif?cult, it is 
rewarding to see the team’s 
hard work pay off.
The competitions are also 
a good experience for Carn-
egie Mellon to hone their 
computer security skills in 
order to become more quali-
?ed applicants in a demand-
ing workforce.
The Plaid Parliament of 
Pwning was created in 2009 
and competed in its ?rst Def-
Con in 2010, winning its ?rst 
two titles in 2013 and 2014.

connection entwining every 
node, however, is Francis 
Bacon, for whom the site is 
named. 
By relating everyone back 
to one person, the informa-
tion stays organized and us-
er-friendly.
Six Degrees of Francis 
Bacon has allowed people to 
research who knew whom 
and how this could have 
in?uenced the lives of differ-
ent people.
 The app creates a bridge 
between technology and the 
humanities as people are 
now able to use computers 
to research what could once 
only be found in writing. It 
makes personal connections 
from the past easy to docu-
ment with today’s modern 
technology. By relaying past 
information in a modern way, 
Six Degrees of Francis Bacon 
also makes these connections 
easier for more people to un-
derstand.
This combination of the 
humanities with new digital 
technologies is one of the 
many advantages that Six De-
grees of Francis Bacon takes 
advantage of. 
“Chris Warren’s work is 
wonderful and deserves to 
be supported by the NEH,” 
said Richard Scheines, dean 
of Carnegie Mellon’s Dietrich 
College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences, in a univer-
sity press release. “Warren’s 
work is solidly grounded in 
the humanities, but he has 
embraced the ‘digital’ tools 
becoming available to ampli-
fy his own scholarship and to 
create a community of schol-
ars in the humanities, all of 
whom will bene?t from these 
tools.”
The aim of the NEH grant 
is to “help bring humanities 
experiences to Americans 
across the country,” NEH 
Chairman William D. Adams 
said in a Carnegie Mellon 
press release. 
By making the entire so-
cial constructs of the British 
early modern era digital, Six 
Degrees of Francis Bacon is 
a tool that can facilitate re-
search. It has also been prov-
en to be useful in classrooms 
by creating relationships 
between scholars similar to 
how social media sites like 
Facebook create connections 
between people today.
“’Six Degrees’ is a terri?c 
tool for use in the classroom,” 
said Shore in a university 
press release. “Not only does 
it introduce students to the 
people of 16th- and 17th-
century Britain in an intuitive 
way, it also shows them that 
they can make real contri-
butions to knowledge based 
on their own research. By 
spending time with period 
documents, students quickly 
gain the expertise to add and 
describe complex relations 
between people, enriching 
our collective understanding 
of how early modern society 
was put together.”
Six Degrees of Francis Ba-
con creates a unique network 
by tracing the connections 
between people of the past. 
Understanding how the peo-
ple of the British early mod-
ern era were related can not 
only give context as to why 
certain people maintained 
the relationships they did, 
but can also reveal relation-
ships that might not have 
been previously known. 
By giving users a modern 
glimpse into the past, this 
app hopes to allow its users 
to ?ll in the blanks missing in 
history.
are being viewed as racially 
motivated events against the 
black community, but also 
due to their being ?lmed by 
those on the scene.
Many of those in the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
have found themselves deep-
ly impacted by these events. The university acknowl-
edged the impact of these 
events on the Carnegie Mel-
lon community, stating in 
the press release that “mem-
bers of the university com-
munity are participants in 
the larger society, and there-
fore affected by the same 
forces and challenges that 
face all of us in the United 
States.” 
They continued by rein-
forcing a message of sup-
port, saying “we offer our 
sympathy and support to all 
members of the CMU family 
who share in the deep con-
cerns that accompany these 
tragedies..”
Affected by this news, 
many supporters of the 
Black Lives Matter move-
ment and those who believe 
in the injustice of these situ-
ations took to protesting to 
express their outrage and 
their desire for peace. 
However, on Thursday, 
July 7, two days after the 
shooting of Sterling and the 
day after the death of Cas-
tille, what should’ve been a 
peaceful protest in Dallas, 
TX took a turn for the worst 
when snipers aimed ?re at 
innocent police of?cers in 
the area seeking retribution 
for these acts of violence.
While these acts have 
impassioned many across 
the nation, the university 
has made it clear that in 
these tough times we should 
not look to violence as the 
solution. 
“As an institution and 
as a community, Carnegie 
Mellon does not tolerate 
violence,” stated the press 
release. “We continue to 
stand for inclusion, compas-
sion and respect. We reas-
sert the bedrock value of 
bringing together people of 
all backgrounds and iden-
tities to live and work to-
gether to enrich the human 
condition.”
The statment also urged 
the Carnegie Mellon com-
munity to act as an example 
and come together against 
violence. 
“As we join the nation in 
grief and shock, we cannot 
become complacent about 
violence or the loss of human 
life,” the press release stated. 
“Each of us in the Carnegie 
Mellon family must continue 
to live out our shared values 
and provide an example of 
how we can work together as 
a respectful community.”
Just as we have come 
to value the interdisciplin-
ary nature of the university 
which seeks ways to cross 
paths between many of the 
individual colleges and ?elds 
of studies, ?nding ways for 
one to support the other, the 
same notion of working to-
gether for the greater good 
should stay with us.

statement can be read on-
line at http://www.cmu.

ment-recent-shootings.
“As an institution and as a

Politicians need to shift focus towards service industry
Manufacturing has always been 
a mainstay in American politics. 
The reasons politicians love manu-
facturing are obvious. Manufactur-
ing jobs used to be broadly union-
ized and tended to pay well with 
some bene?ts all without requiring 
a college degree like many similarly 
paying jobs do. This made the fac-
tories highly favorable due to the 
boost they provided to the econom-
ic well-being of families who might 
otherwise struggle. Furthermore, 
manufacturing the products them-
selves is far more expensive than 
shipping them, so politicians could 
reliably push for manufacturers to 
get all sorts of goodies for bringing 
manufacturing to their districts, 
which in turn made the politicians’ 
constituents happy.
Manufacturing’s role in the 
economy, however, is a different 
story. From the 1960s until recent-
ly, manufacturing has been steadily 
becoming a smaller and smaller part 
of the American economy. After the 
2001 entry of China into the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) and 
the 2000-01 recession, American 
manufacturing took a particularly 
big blow. Manufacturing jobs have 
been in decline even despite the 
recent uptick in the number of fac-
tories around the nation. To make 
things worse, American workers 
became less central to the value of 
manufacturing due to outsourcing 
and automation. As a result, manu-
facturing unions have weakened 
and manufacturing jobs now make 
less money than service sector jobs. 
The average manufacturing worker 
makes $20.47 per hour compared to 
the average service sector worker’s 
$21.37 per hour. The decline in the 
number and value of manufactur-
ing jobs has taken the legitimacy 
out of some politicians’ favorite 
talking points.
Politicians won’t let the reality 
of the situation stop them, how-
ever; and manufacturing talk isn’t 
going away on the campaign trail. 
Both Republican presidential nomi-
nee Donald Trump and Democratic 
presidential nominee Hillary Clin-
ton have dedicated plenty of energy 
to this topic at campaign events. 
The new reasons for going back to 
the manufacturing well for political 
fodder are distressing. The decline 
of American manufacturing has hit 
older workers without college de-
grees particularly hard, and their 
economic anxiety is easy for politi-
cians to take advantage of. Talking 
about bringing back manufacturing 
garners political support from this 
vulnerable population without of-
fering real solutions. In addition, 
the rhetoric of manufacturing jobs 
being “moved” overseas, or coun-
tries having “stolen” jobs from 
Americans makes for very easy 
scapegoats and easier applause 
lines for politicians.
With all of the focus on manufac-
turing, the idea that manufacturing 
is the core of the American identity 
and the American economy is not 
going away. That said, both prongs 
of this idea are probably not true.
Jobs that pay someone enough to 
live and that don’t require a college 
degree are a big part of the Ameri-
can Dream, but those jobs don’t 
necessarily have to be manufactur-
ing. The prominence of unions in 
manufacturing is what caused fac-
tory jobs to be a path to the middle 
class without requiring a degree. As 
unions are weakening, manufactur-
ing no longer even ?ts that bill.
The economy might even be 
better off if we stopped focusing 
so much on manufacturing. Take 
Hon Hai, most commonly known as 
Foxconn, one of the largest manu-
facturing companies. Hon Hai’s rev-
enue is about 70 percent of Apple’s 
and about 190% of Microsoft’s. 
However, their pro?ts are less than 
10 percent of Apple’s and less than 
30 percent of Microsoft’s. Simply 
put, manufacturing companies’s 
pro?t margins are quite slim even 
when they produce high value prod-
ucts such as electronics. As a result, 
manufacturing jobs are not paying 
well enough to help stimulate the 
economy by helping people have 
money to spend, and manufactur-
ing companies also have pro?t mar-
gins too slim to help infuse money 
into the economy. This then drives 
the problem with pay because 
workers are another expense that 
has to be slashed when money gets 
tight. This is bad for the economy as 
a whole.
With manufacturing seemingly 
offering nothing to anyone, it’s 
time politicians turned their focus 
to our continuously growing ser-
vice sector. Since no political blood 
is spilled over the service sector, 
it’s generally vili?ed as a continu-
ous churn of low-paying jobs, but 
it doesn’t have to be. There are a 
number of ideas floating around 
to improve the quality of service 
sector jobs such as unionization. 
New technologies and better man-
agement increase the productivity 
of individual workers which often 
gets that position a raise. These are 
areas the government could poten-
tially be able to help. These are the 
policies that need to start making 
the cut when it comes to jobs plans. 
Current political rhetoric would be 
well placed in the 1940s, but we 
don’t live there anymore. Manufac-
turing can’t absorb so much of our 
economic energy that we ignore 
the economy we have now.
When people run for office, the 
things they say matter. Candidates 
need to stop making promises to 
reverse major trends in the global 
economy — this is not something 
that the government can do. This 
focus also leads politicians to make 
bad decisions which just end up 
weakening our economy and the 
quality of life of the people partici-
pating in it. 
Politicians have to work with 
our current economic reality. The 
service sector jobs that are impos-
sible to outsource or automate have 
stayed, and we have to shift our fo-
cus to making those jobs compen-
sate workers better. Living in the 
past makes for some nice political 
rhetoric but it is no way to shep-
herd an economy.

Women face sexism even in Olympic games
JADE CROCKEM
Operations Manager
The 2016 Rio Olympics have 
certainly been notable for Ameri-
cans, especially American women. 
From Simone Manuel becoming the 
?rst African American to win gold 
in an Olympic swimming event to 
Michelle Carter becoming the ?rst 
American woman to win the shot 
put event, women came to Rio not 
just to win, but to make history. De-
spite all the success of women in the 
Olympics, sexism continues to rear 
its ugly head.
Katie Ledecky has become a 
household name since she ?rst 
stepped into the aquatic arena in Rio. 
Not only has she won gold medals, 
she has broken records and started 
to celebrate her victories long before 
her competitors have even reached 
the wall. There’s no doubt that she’s 
probably one of the fastest women 
in the water, but fellow Olympian 
Connor Drywer confessed that male 
swimmers have been pulled out of 
training because Ledecky beat them. 
The exact term he used to describe 
men she had beat was “broken.” He 
even spoke about how much being 
beat by her ruined the morale of the 
men on the team to the point where 
they couldn’t even ?nish practice.
As athletes, they’re sure to ex-
perience loss, and that the men on 
the U.S. Olympic swimming team 
do not necessarily want her to fail. 
It just seems like they don’t want her 
to succeed more than they do. It’s 
okay to be the best in the world, as 
long as you’re only the best woman 
in the world. Sports as a whole so 
often diminishes the accomplish-
ments of female athletes to feed 
men’s egos. Ledecky once again got 
the short end of the stick when the 
sports section of The Eagle, a news-
paper in Bryan-College Station, TX, 
made Ledecky’s record breaking 800 
meter freestyle win the subheader 
to Michael Phelps’ threeway tie for 
silver. While Ledecky’s accomplish-
ment was objectively more success-
ful, she had to ride on the coattails 
of Phelps’ success to make a head-
line.
I wouldn’t even say this is the 
fault of the newspaper. Men in cer-
tain sports tend to gain more atten-
tion than women due to exposure. I 
bet we’re all guilty of being able to 
name way more NBA players than 
we can WNBA players. This is not 
to say that female athletes don’t get 
exposure, but when it does happen, 
there always seems to be more to 
scrutinize. Most people have noticed 
that Gabby Douglas does not appear 
to be as enthusiastic as she was in 
London in 2012. There could be sev-
eral reasons for this such as the fact 
that she isn’t sixteen and a ?rst time 
Olympian anymore or maybe she 
wasn’t personally satis?ed with her 
performance. Whatever the reason 
may be, it isn’t really anyone’s busi-
ness what’s going on in her personal 
life. She’s an athlete, not a real-
ity TV star. However the headlines 
slammed her as being an unsupport-
ive and jealous team member. I’ve 
yet to read a headline about Ryan 
Lochte being jealous of Michael 
Phelps and they’ve been competing 
with each other since 2003. It seems 
though that if you’re a woman and 
you aren’t smiling the entire time 
your teammate is competing, it must 
be because of jealousy.
It also seems like women have 
a much harder time being able to 
take credit for the things they’ve 
achieved. Katinka Hosszu is a Hun-
garian swimmer whose husband is 
also her coach. After breaking the 
world record for 400-meter indi-
vidual medley, NBC announcer Dan 
Hicks credited her husband as being 
responsible for her record-breaking 
victory. While I’m sure Hosszu’s hus-
band’s training did have an impact 
on her swimming, he is in no way 
responsible. She was the one in the 
pool. Coaches can only do so much, 
a large part of an athlete’s success is 
their dedication and willingness to 
put in time to their sport. His coach-
ing helped her, but her dedication 
and talent is what got the job done.
This type of unfair treatment 
extends beyond the Olympic arena. 
Even at the college level, male sports 
teams often get more attention than 
their female counterparts. Think 
about March Madness — there is not 
really an equivalent for female col-
lege basketball. Although the sports 
culture at Carnegie Mellon is hardly 
comparable to that of a Division I 
university, it’s important to remem-
ber that our female athletes train 
just as hard as our male athletes. 
Sportsmanship is such an important 
quality and just because a man gets 
beat by a woman doesn’t mean he is 
bad at the sport, it just means that 
a woman is better than him at the 
sport. The Olympics is supposed to 
be about sportsmanship and coming 
together more than anything, but if 
some male athletes can’t even ?nish 
a race after being beat by a woman, 
I’m not entirely certain that’s who I 
want representing my country.

The United States and India can 
both lay claim to the title of being 
the world’s largest democracy — al-
beit by different metrics. The United 
States for its economy, and India for 
the number of people it is home to. 
I was brought up in India, but have 
spent the majority of my adult life in 
the U.S. As such, I can’t help but com-
pare and contrast the Indian and U.S. 
experiences.
In some ways, they couldn’t be fur-
ther apart. India is chaotic and messy; 
things rarely work as they’re supposed 
to and are never as they seem. The 
U.S. experience, by comparison, is so 
much cleaner, more organized, and 
seamless. And yet, I’ve found so many 
direct parallels on issues that I can’t 
help but think of these two nations as 
brothers with fundamentally similar 
world views. I used to think no other 
country could contain as many col-
ors of skin, as many religions, and as 
many different points of view as India; 
then I came to the U.S. I used to think 
that the U.S. government system was 
a model of ef?ciency on a large scale. 
Now I know that the U.S. system faces 
many of the same issues that the In-
dian system does — from too much 
bureaucracy, to an electorate too po-
larized to agree on anything, to dan-
gerous demagogues exploiting public 
fear and ignorance to build support.
Constitutionally, unlike the U.S. 
presidential style, India has a par-
liamentary democracy. The Indian 
president is a ?gurehead whose every 
action must be ‘at the advice’ of the 
prime minister — the real leader of 
the electorate. When Indians vote in a 
general election, they aren’t voting for 
either a president or a prime minister. 
They’re voting for members of parlia-
ment (MPs) to represent their constit-
uency. These MPs then elect a prime 
minister from amongst themselves, 
who then picks MPs for his cabinet.
India has two large national level 
parties, the BJP and the Congress, 
and more smaller parties than one can 
count. One advantage of so many po-
litical options is that there are people 
on every side of every issue, instead 
of two opposites and nothing else. 
One disadvantage is that it is hard 
for any party to have a majority. India 
has had coalition governments for the 
better part of the past few decades, 
and such governments take their own 
sweet time building consensus before 
getting anything of any signi?cance 
passed.
Just weeks ago, India instituted a 
goods and services tax (GST), passing 
the most extensive reform of its taxa-
tion code since independence — and 
the process was far from painless. The 
GST Bill was introduced by the cur-
rent BJP government at the start of its 
term in early 2014. Negotiations be-
tween parties and campaigns for and 
against speci?c clauses of the bill con-
tinued in the media for more than two 
years. After concessions from every 
side, a signi?cantly different bill from 
the 2014 version was passed with the 
unanimous support of every voting 
party in Parliament.
GST was a rare example of con-
stant wrangling and negotiating 
yielding something worthwhile in the 
end. The BJP government has been 
trying even harder to get land reform 
passed; however, on an issue that 
polarizing it is unlikely to ever mus-
ter enough support. A more typical 
scene of Indian Parliament is protests 
and sloganeering washing out weeks 
worth of session time. India has also 
had no shortage of Donald Trump 
style ignorance predators. Some de-
cades ago, a leader rose to power in 
north India on a promise to tear down 
the hydroelectric power plants in the 
region. He convinced large parts of 
the farming community that their 
crop failure was the fault of upstream 
hydroelectric plants, that these were 
sucking the energy out of the river 
water that was reaching their farms, 
and that this ‘lifeless’ water was kill-
ing their crops. Fortunately, no power 
plants were brought down, and the 
leader never won an election again.
The above described interplay of 
similarities and differences between 
the U.S. and Indian constitutions is 
found in culture and economics as 
well. The U.S. is undoubtedly far 
more progressive than India is today 
on many social issues. For example, 
homosexuality is just beginning to 
gain acceptance in India. Same-sex 
intercourse is still illegal, and yet LG-
BTQ people are gradually coming out 
of the shadows in open de?ance of 
the law. Other important ideals, such 
as freedom of the press, or freedom 
of religion, are defended with just 
as much vigor in India as in the U.S. 
The government and opposition are 
constantly held accountable by the 
media. Even though India is a Hindu 
majority country, the colorful enter-
tainment industry is dominated by 
Muslims. On some issues, such as gun 
control, India is actually more pro-
gressive than the U.S. Buying assault 
weaponry is virtually impossible in 
India. Buying any kind of weapon at 
all requires an extensive and effective 
background check.
All said and done though, the big-
gest and most important similarity 
between these two nations has got to 
be the incredible diversity they are 
both home to. In India, when I took 
the subway to school, I’d bump into 
people from every walk of life. I’d see 
Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, 
Buddhists, and Parsis. I’d hear a diz-
zying array of languages — includ-
ing English and Hindi, but also Tamil, 
Gujurati, Punjabi and so many more 
that I couldn’t even dream of under-
standing. In India, I remember having 
around two to three public holidays 
every month, because every commu-
nity, every religion and ethnicity has 
its own holidays, which must all be 
celebrated. When I came to the U.S., 
I saw the same thing in every class I 
took, every street I walked down, and 
every Starbucks I went to. This diver-
sity is the greatest asset either country 
could ask for. Rarely does everyone 
agree. Entire communities argue all 
the time. But being exposed to oppos-
ing points of view forces everyone to 
challenge pre-existing assumptions 
and gradually nudges us to the con-
clusion that deep inside, we’re all the 
same — human beings with the same 
aspirations and insecurities.
In some ways, the U.S. is a young 
country. After all, it was founded just 
a couple of centuries ago. But it also 
happens to be one of the oldest de-
mocracies in the world. India, as a de-
mocracy, is just seventy years old. But 
as a civilization, the Indian subconti-
nent is millennia old. Both countries 
can learn so much from each other if 
they can acknowledge their differenc-
es and appreciate their similarities.

PA automated voter registration bill should be implemented
Education is critical issue in 2016 election
India Price/Online Editor
In this incredibly tense election 
year, most people are chomping at the 
bit to vote on Nov. 8. Millions of Amer-
icans, however, aren’t even registered 
to vote, and this isn’t something that 
the attention grabbing races at the top 
of the ballot can ?x. Luckily for Penn-
sylvanians, the State Legislature is 
considering two bills, Senate Bill 806 
and House Bill 1874, that would make 
voter registration automatic. Auto-
matic voter registration could have 
huge bene?ts, but the bills have failed 
to budge.
As of April, around 18 percent of 
Pennsylvanians eligible to vote were 
not registered. To put this in context, 
Obama won Pennsylvania in the 2012 
presidential election by around 5.4 
percent, which shows that if unregis-
tered voters vote, they can easily swing 
an election. These unregistered voters 
are frequently the people who need 
representation in the government the 
most. They are disproportionately 
low-income voters who need the gov-
ernment to provide social safety nets 
and improved job prospects, minority 
voters who need government protec-
tion from discrimination, and young 
voters whose futures hang in the bal-
ance of government decisions. These 
voters need representatives who will 
go to bat for them, but since they are 
not registered, politicians have no in-
centive to pay attention to their needs.
It is easy to write off unregistered 
voters as lazy or apolitical, the argu-
ment being that if they cared, they 
would register. Carnegie Mellon 
students are not usually considered 
lazy, and political science majors are 
not usually labeled apolitical, but 
my freshman year I, a Carnegie Mel-
lon political science major, did not 
manage to get registered in time for 
my ?rst election in Pennsylvania. It’s 
a long and drawn out story, but the 
upshot is that between my workload, 
technology troubles, and other prob-
lems, dozens of relatively small obsta-
cles piled up, and before I knew it the 
deadline had come and gone. That is 
how it is for many people who aren’t 
registered. They would love to do it, 
but they are busy with school or jobs 
or kids and life gets in the way.
The most obvious way to ?x this 
problem is by changing voting regis-
tration to an opt-out system instead 
of the current status quo of needing 
to opt-in. Automatic voter registration 
assumes that people want a voice in 
government, and gives it to them un-
less they say otherwise. This seems 
more in line with the principles of 
democracy rather than only giving 
people a voice if they ask for it and 
jump through the hoops of registra-
tion to get it.
The bills before the State Legisla-
ture would create a system where gov-
ernment agencies that are currently 
authorized to register voters, such as 
the Department of Transportation, 
would automatically submit the nec-
essary information to the Department 
of State to register the voter. The voter 
would then receive a notice allowing 
them to decline the registration. After 
21 days, if the voter has not declined, 
they are added to Pennsylvania’s voter 
rolls.
These bills are modeled from the 
law passed in Oregon last year that 
created the ?rst automatic voter 
registration system in the country. 
Since then, California, Vermont, and 
West Virginia have all followed suit, 
to great effect. According to The Na-
tion, Oregon has gained an average of 
12,889 new voters a month through 
the automatic registration program 
since it went into effect, and has add-
ed 15 voters to the voting rolls for ev-
ery one who has declined registration. 
The proposed bills would not plunge 
Pennsylvania into uncharted territory.
Unfortunately, both the Senate 
and House bills have been stalled in 
committee for months, and the Re-
publicans in charge of both legislative 
bodies are unlikely to bring it to a vote. 
Throwing bills into committee inde?-
nitely is a common tactic used to avoid 
having to vote, making the bill’s cause 
a nonissue and effectively muzzling 
those who support it. The only way to 
combat this silencing is to bring pub-
lic attention to the issue and pressure 
state representatives to take a stand 
on the issue. The bill won’t move until 
we, the public, make it move by mak-
ing it clear to our representatives that 
we care about this issue and won’t ac-
cept their inaction. The legitimacy of 
our democracy isn’t something that 
should be left to rot in committee.

Every four years the Democratic 
and Republican National Conven-
tions rally Americans together 
around their formation of a party 
platform. Celebrities, ?gures from 
the upper echelons of political life, 
social leaders, and individuals cho-
sen for their representation of the 
party’s strength speak live to a con-
vention crowd and, through the 
media, speak to an audience of mil-
lions and millions across the globe. 
It is these conventions that help di-
rect the future of a party, and show 
Americans — and the world — what 
they value. Given the content of 
these conventions and their pub-
lished platforms, it becomes clear 
to me that, as students at four-year 
institutions, a Republican president 
would be hugely damaging to the 
university system in this country, 
and the steps that have been made 
to bring higher education to an in-
creasingly diverse group of individu-
als.
The Republican Convention had 
the potential to use its ?ip-?opping 
presidential candidate to move the 
party to a more progressive plat-
form, since attracting young and 
disappointed Senator Sanders sup-
porters is key to winning the fall 
election—and indeed ensuring the 
stability of the Republican party 
moving forward. However, beneath 
the bigotry, ignorance, and hypoc-
risy that is quintessential to the 
Trump campaign, key issue plat-
forms remain solidly in the conser-
vative camp. With students as the 
future of America, education and 
loan policies are not only personally 
important to current and future stu-
dents, but also of signi?cance to the 
future of the country and America’s 
ability to remain competitive inter-
nationally.
The Republican platform’s stance 
on education is troubling in several 
ways, the most evident of which is 
the issue of college costs. To combat 
student debt, which, according to 
the published Republican Party plat-
form, averages 27-thousand dollars 
per student, the Grand Old Party 
proposes to promote trade schools, 
technical colleges, and other aca-
demic alternatives to compete with 
traditional four-year private and 
public universities. 
While I believe these institutions 
are immeasurably valuable in soci-
ety and should have increased sup-
port and funding from the federal 
government, this will not help those 
millions of young Americans drown-
ing in a quagmire of debt. Not only 
does their platform not address how 
to ?nancially aid those struggling, 
but it also proposes to remove the 
government from being the guaran-
tor of student loans. By taking the 
federal government out of the loan 
market, in addition to not regulat-
ing the accreditation of institutions, 
this platform would give the power 
of shaping young minds — arguably 
the strongest power a nation has — 
to the private sector, and thus big 
money industries. With corporatiza-
tion of universities already a huge 
issue, granting ?nancing power to 
private companies without a clear 
plan for loan regulation would allow 
these powerful organizations even 
more sway in the world of academia. 
Corporatization leads to a wide vari-
ety of university problems, from di-
minished teacher tenure to restrict-
ed research opportunities. America 
is a haven for innovation and intel-
lectual freedom and altering policy 
in this manner could not only hugely 
damage the lives of students, but 
also sti?e revolutionary thought and 
invention.
On the other hand, the Demo-
cratic Party’s platform has clear in-
tention to make higher education 
affordable to more Americans. Ac-
cording to the platform, “bold new 
investments by the federal govern-
ment, coupled with states reinvest-
ing in higher education and colleges 
holding the line on costs, will ensure 
that Americans of all backgrounds 
will be prepared for the jobs and 
economy of the future.” 
As a college student, I under-
stand that the power of education 
lies within its ability to gather indi-
viduals from different backgrounds 
to share ideas together. This plat-
form recognizes that vital focus, in-
stead of giving other organizations 
the power to manipulate what oth-
ers can learn, and potentially re-
stricting who can access education 
altogether.
 The Democrats’ platform goes 
one step further in ensuring that 
those who might be underrepre-
sented in higher education get the 
chance to succeed. By supporting 
what they term Minority-Serving 
Institutions, the platform expressed 
their desire to further fund institu-
tions that prioritize and celebrate 
Americans who have historically not 
been given a ?ghting chance. The 
Democrats’ plan for student debt re-
lief will also enhance opportunities 
for many college-educated Ameri-
cans to contribute more to society by 
being able to re-?nance their loans, 
or pay back money owed through 
income-based repayment, as Demo-
crats hope to expand that payment 
option to more americans.
If Carnegie Mellon has taught 
me anything, it’s that I have learned 
the most from being given the free-
dom to pursue what I want, being 
supported by extremely talented 
faculty, and having a community 
of diverse, brilliant minds. The Re-
publican Convention’s policies re-
garding education undermine what 
many universities stand for and 
would actively encourage what they 
?ght so hard against. It is so easy to 
take education for granted, as a stu-
dent at a renowned university, but 
this election shows us that there is 
so much at stake.
In an election where one major 
party candidate seems so appalling 
and unreal, and the other is deemed 
untrustworthy by many, it is easy 
to get caught up in skepticism. But 
I encourage everyone to take a mo-
ment to consider education — what 
it means to them, and how this elec-
tion might threaten that.
The DNC brought up time and 
time again: Donald Trump’s cam-
paign’s strategy is to terrify indi-
viduals into backing a certain per-
son, terrify them about the dangers 
of the world, and increase distrust 
through misinformation. The solu-
tion to combatting fear like this is 
intelligence, it is level headedness, 
it is awareness and not ignorance. 
As Obama said at the convention, 
“we are not a fragile people.” But 
in times of darkness and under du-
ress, people’s strength comes from 
an ability to synthesize information 
and work together, and we cannot 
afford to sacri?ce these skills by let-
ting Republican politicians lay siege 
to intellectual freedom and access to 
higher education.

With the end of summer 
comes the end of one of sum-
mer’s greatest traditions — 
man-made explosions in the 
sky.
Whether it’s for baseball 
games, the Fourth of July, 
amusement parks, or person-
al pleasure, ?reworks are a 
prevalent part of summer. But 
how exactly do pyrotechnists 
create all those colors and 
shapes in the middle of the 
night sky?
The discovery of ?reworks 
can be traced back to the dis-
covery of gunpowder, which 
occurred around 2,000 years 
ago in China. It is hypothe-
sized that a cook accidentally 
mixed together and heated 
potassium nitrate, charcoal, 
and sulfur to produce a black, 
?akey powder. When this 
powder was inserted into a 
bamboo shoot and tossed in 
a ?re, the pressure inside the 
shoot from the gases of com-
bustion caused the shoot to 
blast apart.
Aside from replacing the 
bamboo shoot with a paper 
tube and adding a fuse, our 
modern de?nition of a ?re-
cracker hasn’t really changed. 
Sometimes, aluminum is add-
ed to the powder to create a 
brighter explosion.
Over time, another fun, 
handheld pyrotechnic soon 
emerged — the sparkler. 
Sparklers consist of a thin 
metal wire dipped in sparkler 
composition and left to dry. 
Sparkler composition typical-
ly contains a metallic fuel, an 
oxidizer, iron or steel powder, 
and a combustion binder to 
hold it all together. 
Adding certain pyrotech-
nic colorants also produces 
different colored sparks — 
strontium for red, calcium for 
orange, sodium for yellow, 
barium for green, and copper 
for blue.
The sparkler is lit from 
one end and burns for several 
minutes, depending on the 
length. Since all the chemi-
cals are proportioned in a 
sparkler, the sparkler burns 
much more slowly than a ?re-
cracker.
However, we can all agree 
that the ultimate pyrotechnic 
is the ?rework. Aerial ?re-
works are found in the form of 
a shell consisting of a cylindri-
cal paper container, various 
shapes of a sparkler-like com-
position known collectively as 
stars, a bursting charge at the 
center of the shell, and a fuse.
A mortar — usually a 
short, steel pipe — launches 
the shell into the air using the 
resulting explosion of a lifting 
charge inside the pipe. The 
lifting charge also lights the 
shell’s fuse, and depending 
on the length of the fuse, the 
bursting charge is ignited at a 
speci?c altitude and the shell 
explodes.
As the shell explodes, the 
outsides of the stars in the 
shell are also ignited, caus-
ing a bright shower of sparks. 
Since the stars are thrown in 
multiple directions via the 
shell’s explosion, the shower 
of sparks forms a huge sphere 
of sparkling light — the most 
basic ?rework shape.
Shells can also ignite in 
multiple phases, known as 
multibreak shells. These can 
be shells within shells, or 
shells with multiple sections 
that are broken apart using 
break charges. These shells 
can contain stars with differ-
ing colors or compositions to 
create different lighting and 
sparkle effects.
But if all ?reworks were 
spherical, the displays 
wouldn’t have as much piz-
zazz as they currently do. The 
shape of the ?rework largely 
depends on the shape of the 
shell and the arrangement of 
the stars.
To create any two-dimen-
sional ?gure, the stars must 
be placed in pellets and ar-
ranged in an outline of the 
?gure in the shell. The pel-
lets are surrounded by break 
charges to separate them si-
multaneously from the shell 
and contain explosive charges 
to propel the stars outward in 
a blown-up form of the ?gure.
Pyrotechnists have stan-
dardized many of the popular 
shaped ?reworks. To name a 
few, palm ?reworks contain 
charges in the shape of a solid 
cylinder that travel outward 
before exploding, then curl 
downwards after exploding to 
form the limbs of a palm tree. 
Willow ?reworks (my per-
sonal favorite) contain stars 
with a higher composition of 
charcoal to make the sparkles 
burn longer so when the stars 
fall they form the shape of a 
willow tree.
Pyrotechnists are pushing 
the limit of what shapes and 
colors can be achieved with 
?reworks with every show, 
leading to an increasingly en-
joyable viewing experience.

Everyone’s got their own 
tips and tricks to solving math 
problems. But a research team 
at Carnegie Mellon may have 
scienti?cally standardized the 
actual process our brain un-
dergoes when thinking about 
math.
The researchers recently 
published a new report in 
Psychological Science that de-
scribes the various mental 
stages the brain undergoes 
while doing math. The team 
was led by John R. Anderson, 
winner of the 2016 Atkinson 
prize for Psychological and 
Cognitive Sciences by the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences 
and R.K. Mellon University 
Professor of Psychology and 
Computer Science at Carnegie 
Mellon University. The study 
was funded by the National 
Science Foundation and James 
S. McDonnell Foundation.
The researchers used two 
analytical methods of func-
tional magnetic resonance im-
aging (fMRI) to view different 
parts of the brain. These im-
ages were then used to iden-
tify different processes the 
brain uses to do math, which 
were condensed into the four 
stages of problem solving: en-
coding, planning, solving and 
responding.
“How students were solv-
ing these kinds of problems 
was a total mystery to us until 
we applied these techniques,” 
said Anderson in a university 
press release. “Now, when stu-
dents are sitting there think-
ing hard, we can tell what they 
are thinking each second.”
The two analytical meth-
ods the researchers combined 
are called multi-voxel pattern 
analysis (MVPA), which iden-
ti?es the momentary activa-
tion patterns in parts of the 
brain, and hidden semi-Mar-
kov models (HSMM), which 
analyzes the long-term effects 
of these patterns.
The next step for the team, 
which also included Aryn A. 
Pyke and Jon M. Fincham of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Depart-
ment of Psychology, was to 
test whether or not their pre-
dicted mapping matched up 
with how real people think.
The test consisted of 80 
subjects, each of them pro-
vided with 88 math problems. 
The subjects were given differ-
ent types of math problems, 
i.e., the problems would focus 
on a different stage of problem 
solving and feedback in the 
form of a light that lit up red 
when the answer was incor-
rect and lit up green other-
wise.
The problems involved 
teaching the 80 subjects math-
ematical symbols, tools, and 
equations that were absolutely 
new to them, and then make 
them navigate the otherwise 
basic mathematical problems 
using those tools.
It was found that the spe-
ci?c complexity in terms of 
the stages of problem solving 
correlated with the time taken 
by the brain activity during 
that stage. For instance, if the 
problem was more complex in 
terms of the “planning stage,” 
the process stage of the brain 
while planning would be lon-
ger and proportional to the 
complexity of the problem.
This study not only allows 
scientists to understand how 
the brain works with math, 
but can also be instrumental to 
designing curriculums and un-
derstanding how this applies 
to other creative problems.
Although this is signi?cant 
progress towards a greater un-
derstanding of cognitive pro-
cesses, researchers still don’t 
quite understand how these 
tasks can be mapped onto 
other real-time tasks and ?t 
together as a coherent whole. 
However, this research has 
opened door towards an ap-
plication of these techniques 
to a wider range of situations 
and topics.
Identical twins are found to live longer than fraternal twins 
According to a recent study 
by the University of Washing-
ton, identical twins live longer 
than fraternal twins. The study 
is the ?rst of its kind to ana-
lyze what being a twin means 
for life expectancy. Lead au-
thor of the study David Shar-
row says his team found that 
“at nearly every age, identical 
twins survive at a higher pro-
portion than fraternal twins, 
and fraternal twins are a little 
higher than the general popu-
lation.” Their data comes from 
the Danish Twin Registry, from 
which the scientists examined 
nearly 3,000 pairs of identi-
cal twins born in Denmark 
between 1870 and 1900, all 
having survived past the age of 
10. They found that 6 percent 
more male twins survived into 
their mid-40’s than did males 
of the general population, 
with a higher difference of 10 
percent for female twins. The 
authors of the study think their 
results show the bene?ts of 
having a close social relation-
ship with someone. By having 
such a close personal bond as 
twins do, they say it can pro-
vide healthy outlets and activi-
ties, and “provide material or 
emotional support that lead to 
better longevity outcomes.” Re-
searchers think this study has 
implications beyond twins, and 
that close social relationships 
for anyone could have positive 
effects on longevity.

3-D molecules are displayed in a new and improved way
Researchers at the Depart-
ment of Energy’s Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory 
and UC Berkeley have created 
a type of “display case” that 
allows for new atomic-scale 
views of molecules that have 
previously been dif?cult to ex-
amine. This new display can 
help reveal structural details 
of molecules that were not pre-
viously known in order to aid 
research on chemically com-
plex compounds and even new 
drugs. This works by stabiliz-
ing the molecules inside what 
the scientists call “metal-or-
ganic frameworks”, or MOFs. 
The researchers introduced 
molecules that were chemi-
cally bound to the MOFs, and 
then used x-ray techniques to 
precisely determine the mo-
lecular structure of the mol-
ecules. The molecules used in 
the study range from simple 
alcohol to complex plant hor-
mones, and the MOFs used 
are easy to manufacture in 
large numbers. This is critical 
because the MOFs are most 
useful in that they can deter-
mine a molecules “chirality” 
by selectively binding with 
molecules that possess the 
same chirality as the MOF. 
Chirality is best explained as 
left vs. right-handedness, and 
it is crucial for pharmaceutical 
companies to know because it 
can determine the difference 
between a medicine and a poi-
son.

Eating turns off nerve cells that counter obesity
Researchers at the Fran-
cis Crick Institute in London 
have found that eating shuts 
down a group of specialized 
nerve cells in mice, designed 
to energize. Once eating stops, 
these nerve cells reactivate. 
These nerve cells are provid-
ing scientists with new clues 
about how the brain controls 
appetitie. The cells produce 
a chemical called orexin (or 
hypocretin), which has been 
thought to have a role in ap-
petite for years. The cells are 
so perplexing because they 
are largely absent from people 
with narcolepsy, and narco-
leptic people are more likely 
to be overweight than a non-
narcoleptic person. 
When scientists used a 
genetic technique to remove 
the orexin cells from mice, 
they found that the mice at 
more than normal, which led 
to weight gain. The results of 
the study suggest that giving 
orexin to people like narco-
leptics who lack it could re-
duce obesity, the researchers 
also warn against its adverse 
effects. Study coauthor De-
nis Burkadov says an overac-
tive orexin system can lead 
to stress and anxiety, which 
also raises the possibility that 
anxiety can be reduced by de-
creasing orexin cell activity. 
He also says it provides “an ex-
planation for why people eat 
in times of anxiety.”

Stanford researchers used satellite data to ?nd poor areas
A team of researchers at 
Stanford University trained 
a computer system to iden-
tify impoverished areas from 
survey and satellite data in 
five African countries. Neal 
Jean and Marshall Burke of 
the research team say that 
their system can transform 
the way we track and target 
poverty. Poverty data has tra-
ditionally been collected by 
household surveys, sending 
people to houses and ask-
ing questions about income 
and consumption. However, 
these surveys are costly, hard 
to keep recent, and impos-
sible in certain areas of the 
world due to conflict. 
The new model developed 
by Jean and Burke’s team is a 
more all-inclusive approach. 
The model looks at a pletho-
ra of factors to determine an 
area in poverty. The model 
takes into account paved 
roads, metal roofs, urban 
areas, farmland, and many 
other things in imageges that 
together can be predictive of 
poverty. 
Burke explained that the 
model is “surprisingly pred-
icative of economic liveli-
hoods in these countries.” 
An assistant professor at UC 
Berkeley, Joshua Blumen-
stock, said this model can 
ultimately “help ensure that 
resources get to those with 
the greatest need.”

New species of ancient dolphin identi?ed
After spending decades in 
the Smithsonian Museum of 
Natural history in Washing-
ton, D.C., scientists from the 
museum have re-examined a 
skull that belonged to a pre-
viously unrecognized species. 
The skull is believed to belong 
to a relative of the South Asian 
river dolphin, an endangered 
species. The skull is only par-
tial, is about nine inches in 
length and was discovered in 
1951 in Alaska by geologist 
Donald J. Miller. 
The new study’s authors 
Alexandra Boersma and 
Nicholas Pyenson say that 
the dolphin swam in sub-arc-
tic waters about 25 million 
years ago, and represents a 
new species named Arktocara 
yakataga. Scientists estimate 
that Arkotcara came from the 
late Oligocene epoch, around 
the time that whales split into 
two classes of baleen whales 
and toothed whales. The team 
determined that Arktocara, 
previously known as Platani-
sta, is indeed a relative of the 
South Asian river dolphin, 
which means that the endan-
gered species is the last living 
relative of a once widespread 
group of dolphins. Scientists 
say that while they know the 
relationship, how a once di-
verse and widespread group 
came down to single species 
in Southeast Asia is still a mys-
tery.

Some insects like dragon?ies likely can’t sense gravity
Insects known for ?ying 
in dramatic patterns at high 
speeds, such as dragon?ies 
and hover?ies, have to ex-
ecute turns with great preci-
sion, but scientists have never 
known whether or not they 
use gravity to control them-
selves. 
Roman Goulard of Aix-
Marseille University in 
France wanted to determine 
if and how these insects are 
in?uenced by gravity. Gou-
lard simulated gravity by 
dropping hover?ies in dif-
ferent lab environments and 
observing how they react to 
free-fall.
In a dark box, 70 percent 
of ?ies were too slow to beat 
their wings and crashed. In 
a light box, the insects had 
better reaction speed, but 
many still crashed. The ?nal 
box was light with striped 
walls and the ?ies were much 
faster to beat their wings with 
only 10 percent of the ?ies 
crashing. 
While the study does not 
completely prove that hov-
er?ies do not sense gravity, 
the insects still do not have a 
means to sense acceleration. 
This means that they must 
use only sight and air?ow to 
determine their location in 
space.

HOW THINGS WORK

---------------------------------------------------

August 19, 2016 « The Tartan thetartan.org/sports » A7
FALL SPORTS PREVIEW
Football
The Carnegie Mellon foot-
ball team ended the 2015–
2016 season on a high note, 
winning their last six regular 
season games and dominat-
ing rival UAA opponents Uni-
versity of Chicago and Case 
Western Reserve University 
before routing Bridgewater 
State in the ECAC Legacy 
Bowl 48–13. The latter half of 
the season for Tartan football 
consisted of then sophomore 
running back Sam Benger 
having a record-breaking 
season, allowing the Tartans 
to boast spectacular offen-
sive numbers. Benger set five 
separate Carnegie Mellon 
records, including single-sea-
son rushing yards at 2,092; 
making him the twenty first 
player in NCAA Division III 
history to reach the 2,000 
yard mark. Benger also led 
the entirety of NCAA Division 
III in rushing yards and yards 
per game for the 2015–2016 
season. Even amidst the 
historic performance from 
Benger, the Tartan defense 
found a way to shine as well. 
The defense held multiple 
opponents to two scores or 
less, creating massive score 
differentials in games against 
weaker opponents such as 
the Tartans’ 52–7 beat down 
of the University of Chicago. 
The Tartans finished the sea-
son with an 8–3 record, and 
thus look much better than 
they have in recent years. As 
for this year, the Tartans were 
picked fifth in the President’s 
Athletic Conference (PAC) 
preseason poll, but if they 
continue their winning streak 
from last season, they are 
poised to place much higher 
than fifth. Benger, along with 
defensive counterparts Brian 
Khoury and Drew Fitzmorris, 
were selected as preseason 
All-Americans, meaning the 
Tartans have some big play-
makers returning and they 
are ready to succeed. The 
2016–2017 season is looking 
bright for this Tartan team, 
but we’ll have to see if they 
can live up to the hype.
Volleyball
Carnegie Mellon’s vol-
leyball team is coming off a 
statement-making season, 
boasting a 29–8 record and 
placing second in the ECAC 
South Tournament Champi-
onship. Multiple players also 
earned awards, including 
senior Jackie Gibbons with 
an All-American honorable 
mention, and senior Molly 
Higgins who was named the 
ECAC South defensive player 
of the year. The Tartan vol-
leyball team will be bringing 
in five new first-year players 
for the 2016–2017 season, 
hoping to add to their reper-
toire of talented players and 
to continue being a top team 
in their region. With six se-
niors returning, the Tartans 
should have a strong roster to 
work with and should also be 
able to foster new talent with 
the experience of these vet-
eran players as their guide. 
The Tartan volleyball team 
begins its journey through 
the season on Sept. 2 against 
McDaniel College at the Get-
tysburg Battlefield Classic in 
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team had an 
above average 2015–2016 
season, ending with an 11–
4–3 record while going un-
defeated on their home turf. 
The Tartans played through 
a number of close matches, 
with five games going into 
double overtime. Despite 
their winning record, the end 
of last season was bittersweet 
for the Tartans as they lost in 
the first round of the NCAA 
Division III tournament. Se-
nior Tristan Lockwood was 
named to the ECAC South 
All-Star team last season, and 
shows promise in upcoming 
competitions. The Tartan 
men will surely be hungry to 
get further into the postsea-
son after their run was cut 
short last year. The Tartan 
men’s first competition will 
be at home against Musking-
um University on Sept. 1.
Carnegie Mellon’s wom-
en’s soccer team is coming 
off a near-perfect season, go-
ing 17–2–1 over the course 
of the 2015–2016 season, 
and fighting all the way to 
the third round of the NCAA 
Division III Tournament. 
The Tartan women received 
numerous awards for their 
performance. Senior Katie 
Liston and juniors Tori Iat-
arola and Katie Strycharz 
were named for the ECAC 
South All-Star first team. Lis-
ton was also named the ECAC 
South Defensive Player of the 
Year, while head coach Yon 
Struble was named the ECAC 
South Coach of the Year. Iat-
arola was also named an All-
American by D3soccer.com, 
and graduate Carson Quiros 
was selected as a UAA Nomi-
nee for the NCAA Woman of 
the Year award. The Tartan 
women come into the 2016–
2017 season ready to try and 
run the table, with key play-
ers returning and a thirst 
to finish their run through 
the NCAA playoffs that was 
stopped short last year. The 
Tartan women’s first com-
petition will be on Sept. 2 at 
home against Franciscan Uni-
versity.
Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s tennis team played 
well in the 2015–2016 sea-
son, with an overall record of 
17–7. Then senior Abhishek 
Alla advanced the farthest 
into the NCAA tournament of 
any of the Tartan men, even-
tually losing in the semifinals 
to close out a stellar career. 
The Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association (ITA) named 
Alla, along with sophomores 
Daniel Levine and Vayum 
Arora, All-Americans. The 
ITA also named the Tartan 
men an All-Academic team 
for the 2015–2016 season, 
with seven players being 
named ITA Scholar Athletes. 
But now the Tartans have to 
focus on a new season with 
new players, and they will 
look to returning veterans 
Kenny Zheng, Kiril Kirkov, 
and Kunal Wadwani to lead 
the team and guide them to 
victory. If the Tartan men 
want to advance further into 
the NCAA tournament than 
they did last year, they will 
have some big shoes to fill in 
the absence of Alla. The first 
competition of the 2016-2017 
season for the Tartan men 
will be on Sept. 9 at home for 
the Carnegie Mellon Invita-
tional.
Carnegie Mellon’s wom-
en’s tennis team is coming 
off a 2015-2016 season with 
many ups and downs. The 
women finished with a 15–7 
record, although undefeated 
at home and in regional play. 
The Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association (ITA) named se-
nior Brooke Tsu, along with 
senior Vanessa Pavia and 
junior Cori Sidell to the ITA 
All-American team. They also 
named the Tartan women an 
All-Academic team for the 
2015–2016 season, with nine 
players being named ITA 
Scholar Athletes. The Tar-
tans have some very strong 
players returning for the 
2016–2017 though, and they 
will be looking to improve on 
last season’s performance. 
Sophomore Marina Sele-
nica boasted a 10–2 record 
in singles last season while 
senior Nicholle Torres and 
sophomore Jamie Vizelman 
each finished the season with 
a 17–7 singles record. The 
Tartan women’s best doubles 
pair of then senior Brooke 
Tsu and Vizelman will be 
split up, but Vizelman will 
surely find another partner 
to battle it out on the court 
with. With this much talent 
still developing and a few 
veteran players there to lead 
the way, the Tartan women 
can only get better from here. 
Their first competition will 
be on Sept. 9 at home for the 
Carnegie Mellon Invitational.

U.S. mens basketball team fails to live up to expectations
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staff
The American basketball 
teams have dominated the 
Olympics throughout most 
of history. This makes a lot of 
sense. Men’s professional bas-
ketball is the 5th most popu-
lar sport in America, but that 
number becomes even more 
important to ?elding a team 
when you consider that col-
lege and professional football 
(numbers three and one on 
that list) draw from the same 
talent pool and auto racing 
(number four) requires a very 
different build from basket-
ball. That list is dominated 
by men’s sports for whatever 
reason, but it is likely that the 
popularity of women’s bas-
ketball is in a similar place 
when it comes to women’s 
sports, considering that three 
of the four sports above bas-
ketball do not have profes-
sional leagues for women. 
Further, America’s wealth of 
sports funding means that a 
large amount of that inter-
est is turned into talent. The 
U.S. has the Olympic medals 
to show for it with the women 
winning seven of 10 Olympic 
tournaments and the men 
winning 14 of 18. Since its 
1992 loss to the Uni?ed Olym-
pic Team, the Women’s team 
has been dominant, winning 
the Olympics and racking up 
huge margins of victory to 
validate their gold medals. 
The men, on the other hand, 
have made it their mission 
since 2000 to give every U.S. 
Basketball fan a heart attack 
as they battle through inter-
national competition.
In 2000, the American 
men had a rough time with 
the Lithuanian National 
Team twice, despite that 
team not having any NBA 
talent or Arvydas Sabonis, 
the best player in Lithuanian 
basketball history. The ?rst 
game between the two was 
a little more tilted towards 
the U.S., as they turned a 
six-point halftime lead into 
a nine-point victory, but the 
real scare came in the semi-
?nal. Lithuania was up eight 
points going into halftime 
and the U.S. team struggled 
to play their style of basket-
ball as they barely eked out a 
two-point victory. The same 
opponent was at it again in 
2008 when a Lithuanian team 
now led by NBA player Linas 
Kleiza played the U.S. well 
in the preliminary rounds 
and the Americans ?nished 
with only a ?ve-point vic-
tory. In the 2012 ?nals, the 
U.S. barely edged out Spain. 
The Americans won by seven, 
but they led by only one go-
ing into a closely contested 
fourth quarter.
In 2004, the Americans 
hit their low point in recent 
Olympic history. The U.S. had 
a very young team with play-
ers like LeBron James, Car-
melo Anthony, and Dwyane 
Wade having only played one 
season in the NBA. The U.S. 
barely made it out of their 
group after losing two pre-
liminary games. One was an 
embarrassing 19-point loss 
to Puerto Rico, a team the 
U.S. should have beaten eas-
ily. The other one involved 
Lithuania ?nally overcoming 
the U.S. team’s advantage 
in talent to win by ?ve. The 
U.S. took the ?rst step to-
wards righting the ship in the 
quarter?nals when they beat 
Spain by eight, though the 
score understated how much 
the Americans outplayed the 
Spanish team. However, the 
play didn’t last as the U.S. 
suffered an embarrassing loss 
to Argentina in the semi?nal 
before beating Lithuania for 
the bronze medal.
It was the U.S.’s ?rst fail-
ure to win the gold since they 
took bronze in 1988 and their 
only one since.
However, this American 
team is following in the foot-
steps of the ones before it 
who struggled to live up to 
their lofty expectations. Af-
ter two big wins out of the 
gate against teams that were 
never expected to make much 
noise at the Olympics, the 
Americans were thoroughly 
outplayed in the ?rst half by 
Australia in their third pre-
liminary game, but played 
well enough in the second 
half to pick up a 10-point vic-
tory. Their next two games 
against Serbia and France 
?nished as only three-point 
games and Serbian Bojan 
Bogdanovic missed a wide 
open three-point shot to send 
the game into overtime. This 
was supposed to be the best 
defense in U.S. Olympic his-
tory, but they’ve been playing 
lazy, meandering basketball 
on that end to this point. Even 
in their 27-point destruction 
of Argentina, after the U.S. 
went up in the second quar-
ter, Argentina found plenty 
of open three-pointers, they 
just never hit any and the U.S. 
was able to sleepwalk its way 
to an impressive ?nal score.
This U.S. team played far 
below expectations. Despite 
several players declining to 
play in Rio, this was supposed 
to be a dominant defensive 
team that suffocated relative-
ly weak international opposi-
tion. Three of their ?ve wins 
in the preliminary rounds 
were a few bad bounces away 
from being losses, and their 
lack of effort at times was 
embarrassing for an Olympic 
competition. The U.S. is still 
the best basketball country in 
the world, but the men’s team 
seems insistent on making 
everyone doubt that. If they 
fail to take home the gold, 
it will look like their grip on 
international basketball is 
slipping.
Rapid growth of Esports raises questions about investments 
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
Esports, otherwise known 
as competitive gaming, is a 
rapidly growing industry that 
caters to the competitive na-
ture of humans, while ful?ll-
ing that millennial need of al-
ways having one’s eyes glued 
to a screen. Many people dis-
miss the idea of esports being 
a legitimate competitive out-
let, either because they don’t 
realize how large the indus-
try already is, or they haven’t 
played enough video games 
to understand how they can 
be competitive. Those opin-
ions are beside the point, 
because in the world of gam-
ing, one common desire that 
people share is that they want 
to watch a game they love be 
played at the highest level. It 
doesn’t matter if it’s Ameri-
can football, cricket, rugby, 
or water polo, if people play 
the sport they will want to 
see the best of the best play. 
The most popular sports have 
well established leagues, and 
professional, clear-cut broad-
casts used to explain the 
game to viewers and to com-
ment on the action. This can 
be found in esports as well: 
League of Legends, one of the 
most popular esports, is orga-
nized into regional leagues 
that play a full regular season 
with playoffs at the end, cul-
minating in an international 
world championship, all or-
ganized by the developer 
of League of Legends, Riot 
Games.
With such a high level of 
organization, big name spon-
sors are starting to notice just 
how similar esports are to tra-
ditional sports and and as a 
result are beginning to invest 
heavily. 
These investors see the 
value in putting money into 
such a rapidly growing in-
dustry, but it’s possible that 
the established leagues could 
be unintentionally pushing 
these investors away. For 
example, in the Riot Games-
hosted League Championship 
Series (LCS), some serious in-
vestors have recently bought 
teams and attempted to try 
their hand in the esports 
world. In North America, 
former NBA player Rick Fox 
purchased a slot in the LCS, 
along with NRG Esports of 
which another NBA star, Sha-
quille O’Neal, is a part owner. 
In Europe, established soccer 
club Schalke 04 purchased a 
spot in the LCS as well. Al-
ready we can see a problem 
with this system: Investors 
can purchase the slots of fail-
ing teams that want to sell 
the spot without having to 
qualify for the league itself.
This may seem like a ben-
e?t at ?rst glance, but in real-
ity the teams put together by 
these new investors are not 
the best, in fact they are rare-
ly in the top half of the stand-
ings. While a spot in the LCS 
can be purchased, the bottom 
three teams in the LCS have 
to play to retain their spot 
in the LCS once the season 
is over. This means that new 
teams purchased by big name 
investors often have to ?ght 
for the spot they purchased, 
without ever having time to 
get settled in the new league 
and improve as a team over 
time. The argument against 
this is that the best teams will 
adapt quickly. This is true, 
but anyone that plays a team 
game knows that it takes 
time to build chemistry with 
teammates and get used to a 
routine. So while the teams 
that have been competing in 
LCS for years are always at 
the top of the standings, the 
bottom half of the standings 
is usually a revolving door 
of new teams with new in-
vestors that never seems to 
settle. Without there being 
a guarantee that an inves-
tor will have time to develop 
their team and their brand 
within the esports industry, 
it could very well turn off big 
name investors that might 
have otherwise supported 
esports or tried to start their 
own team. That said, some 
investors do choose to stick 
around even after losing 
their spot in the LCS. Schalke 
04, after being relegated in 
their ?rst split (half season) 
of LCS, announced that they 
would not disband their team 
and would instead continue 
to develop talent and the in-
dustry as a whole with their 
in?uence. NRG Esports on 
the other hand, disbanded 
their League of Legends 
team and moved on to focus 
on other esports. Rick Fox’s 
team, Echo Fox, had to ?ght 
for their spot in the LCS as 
well, but they persevered and 
retained it for next season, 
which shows investors that it 
is possible to get in and stay 
in, even with a new team.
But how could the prob-
lem be resolved? Multiple 
team owners including Fox 
have suggested franchis-
ing, which is a system typi-
cally used in American sports 
leagues that locks teams into 
their spots in the league. This 
is why we have the same 32 
teams in the NFL every year, 
this is why the Cleveland 
Browns or the Philadelphia 
76ers were never kicked out 
their leagues for being bad 
teams.
 While franchising is clear-
ly the better option for team 
owners that want time to de-
velop a new team within the 
league, it also brings up the 
question of whether or not 
franchising is fair to teams. 
Team Mis?ts defeated NRG 
Esports for their spot in the 
LCS and now Mis?ts, a brand 
new team, will get to try their 
hand in the LCS. They cer-
tainly deserve it after handily 
defeating NRG, who was sup-
posed to be an LCS-caliber 
team. But what if they had 
never even had the opportu-
nity to play for that spot? Mis-
?ts would still be dominating 
every team in the Challenger 
Series (essentially the minor 
league for LCS) and NRG 
would be at the bottom of the 
barrel, unable to lose their 
spot even though a team in 
the league below could beat 
them handily. If people want 
to watch the best of the best 
play, then only the best of the 
best should be playing, not 
teams that only remain in the 
league because it’s written in 
a contract.
 While franchising may 
give new teams time to im-
prove, it could potentially 
make the viewer experi-
ence less enjoyable by keep-
ing teams in the league that 
shouldn’t be there. It’s hard 
to say whether or not fran-
chising is a good idea. With-
out it, the Tampa Bay Buc-
caneers would have been 
kicked out of the NFL as fast 
as they got into it, and they 
never would have won the 
Super Bowl. However, teams 
that have never been to the 
Super Bowl, like the Cleve-
land Browns, still exist but re-
main in the league because of 
franchising. The NFL is obvi-
ously a different case because 
of the scale of the games: 
large stadiums and nation-
wide broadcasts. It is a larger 
undertaking compared to cre-
ating an esports team, but it 
is an investment nonetheless.
Regardless of whether or 
not franchising is good for 
esports in the long run, in-
vesting in the industry is de?-
nitely worth it. 
Rick Fox has shown that 
even without franchising, its 
entirely possible to keep a 
spot in the LCS with a brand 
new team. That alone may 
not be enough to convince 
other investors though, and 
the LCS may need franchis-
ing to attract more big names 
after two of the largest recent 
sponsors were relegated from 
the LCS this year. 
All that matters is that 
people continue to realize the 
potential that esports has as 
an industry, and it will keep 
growing. As the millennial 
generation gets older, they 
will have a more disposable 
income, leading to even more 
opportunities for investors to 
get people interested in their 
brand, but they need to start 
now. 
The best investors for the 
industry will be in it for the 
long haul. Any investor who 
sees the potential growth in 
the esports industry would be 
naïve not to at least explore 
their opportunities.

Carnegie Mellon Survival Guide
Orientation Week is a ton of fun, but don’t let it fool 
you into thinking that Carnegie Mellon is always 
this great. Things can get busy. Very very busy. 
When the work hits, you’ve got to be prepared to 
be running from class to meetings to the library and 
back to class with barely enough time to breathe. 
Most of the people here are amazing — passionate 
and ambitious yet warm and helpful. But I guarantee 
you’ll meet at least one selfish schmuck who’ll drive 
you nuts or let you down at the worst possible time. 
The majority of your professors and classes will be so 
amazing as to inspire you to do better than you ever 
thought possible. That said, no work in the world is 
fun at three in the morning when you’re running on 
four hours of sleep.
I’ve made more than my fair share of mistakes in 
my three years here so far. Here are a bunch of 
suggestions that can help you survive and thrive 
in the parts of Carnegie Mellon you read about in 
admissions brochures, as well as the dark underbelly 
you want to, but will never quite be able to avoid. 
Some of the suggestions listed below are what you 
might call typical college advice, and some of them 
are decidedly more Carnegie Mellon specific.
1. Learn to slowly let go: High School is over. Like 
everyone else here, you’ve left a ton behind to come 
here — whether that is your parents, your closest 
friends, or a significant other you’re hoping to keep 
things going with (good luck with that). Deal with it. 
Don’t forget about them, but acknowledge that they 
now all belong in a compartment in your mind. You 
have got to make space for new things. New people 
and new priorities. Get out and talk to everyone you 
can — men, women, athletes, nerds and artists. I 
guarantee you’ll find at least one person you’ll be 
surprised you got along with.
2. Friday nights: Frat parties are great, but most of 
the time there are way cooler things to do with your 
time. Go out on the town. Pittsburgh is an amazing 
city with a ton of stuff to do. Downtown Pittsburgh 
in particular is absolutely stunning at night. Go for 
long long walks around campus and the general area. 
Find a favorite spot. You’ll find yourself repeatedly 
returning to it in your next four or five years here. 
A personal favorite of mine is Panther Hollow — a 
little forest with trails and a lake just five minutes 
from campus. At night, the place is pitch dark, pretty 
scary and probably even a little dangerous. Carry a 
torch, and I don’t mean the one that comes in an app 
on your phone.
3. Food & Beverage: You’ve probably heard this a 
bunch of times already, but I’m going to repeat it 
again. Get off the meal plan as soon as you can. Off 
campus food is, as a thumb rule, cheaper, healthier 
and tastier than on campus stuff. Craig Street in 
particular should be your best friend. If you go 
to Sushi Fuku, be sure to ask Jose to make you a 
’Salmon on the Beach’. It isn’t on the menu, but he’ll 
know what you’re talking about! Sunday brunch 
should, by law, be at Crepes Parisienne. The place’s 
crepes and croissants are to die for. Also while on 
campus food may not be too great, on campus coffee 
is a surprising exception. La Prima Espresso, on the 
5th floor of Wean Hall, makes the best Cappuccinos 
and Mochas that I have ever had. Tazza D’Oro on the 
3rd floor of the Gates Hillman Centre isn’t too bad 
either.
4. Find yourself: College isn’t so much about 
figuring out what you want to be as it is figuring 
out who you want to be. Be spontaneous. Take risks 
that you wouldn’t dare take if you still lived with 
your folks. This could be taking a class in Middle 
Eastern History because why not, or it could be an 
impromptu road trip in a rental car to a place you’ve 
never even heard of. It is only when you step outside 
your comfort zone that you can learn new things 
about yourself.
5. Take it easy: This, in my opinion, is the hardest 
thing to do at Carnegie Mellon. Everyone is always 
in such a hurry and everyone is always so focused 
on their priorities that it becomes easy to forget that 
college is anything more than a resume building 
exercise. It is important to have a goal and move 
towards it. But don’t put on a pair of blinders and 
look so far straight ahead that you’re not willing to 
risk a sideward glance and appreciate where you 
are.
6. Keep it local: Whatever you want to do, whether 
its just visit the roofs, or some underage drinking, or 
even a little bit of pot, you’re probably much safer 
doing it on campus. Your RAs, housefellows and 
even Carnegie Mellon police will usually be much 
more tolerant and understanding than the Pittsburgh 
cops. Downtown, I’ve heard of people getting taken 
to lockup for carrying a fake ID. Closer to campus, 
you’re likely to get a citation at worst.
7. Don’t get caught.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Sarah,
I’m an incoming first-
year and I’m anxious 
about a lot of things, but 
what really frightens me 
are certain invasions of 
privacy that come with 
group living.
I don’t like the idea of 
breathing the same air 
as another person while 
I poop. Feeling my most 
vulnerable, skivies around 
my ankles, and separated 
by another human at 
their most vulnerable 
by a short wall. I can’t 
plan what kind of noises 
and smells they’ll be 
subjected to, and that just 
makes me feel impolite.
It’s not like I can just 
stop pooping because 
I will never stop eating 
Chipotle, but I don’t know 
how to get over my fears.
I’ve heard stories about 
“poop stalemates” where 
two people try to poop 
at the same time, both 
trying to wait the other 
out to poop in peace. This 
sounds like a nightmare, 
and I don’t want to leave 
something so important 
to my happiness up to a 
game of nerve.
I’m very attached to 
my morning routine 
 — poop, shower, brush 
teeth, poop, rinse, get 
dressed, do make-up, eat 
breakfast. Without it the 
whole day won’t feel right.
How do I poop in college?
Anxiously,
Seriously, Please Help I 
Need Comfort To Ease 
Rectum
Dear SPHINCTER,
This is a concern I, 
too, had as a first-year 
student, clinging to my 
modesty. But fear not, 
because there is hope. 
There are ways to make 
this dilemma easier to 
face.
I became well-known on 
my floor for my “poop 
bag,” that I kept stocked 
with flushable wipes and 
a can of Febreeze. Going 
in equipped with more 
creature comforts can 
make being a creature 
more comfortable.
Plus, stalls aren’t the only 
option, depending on 
how far you’re willing to 
walk. Many of the dorm 
lobbies have one-room 
bathrooms that you can 
lock up and shut away 
from the world.
And on campus during 
the day, there are a few 
one-room spots I prefer, 
and I’ll let you in on my 
secret: the third floor 
of Baker Hall at the top 
of the spiral, the fourth 
floor of Gates down the 
hallways next to Rashid 
auditorium, and the third 
floor of the Cohon Center 
next to the elevator.
But truly, when it comes 
down to it, you can’t 
keep screening nature’s 
calls or you’ll have to 
call the doctor. This is 
part of being human 
and the sooner you get 
comfortable with it, the 
better life is.
Happy pooping,
Sarah Gutekunst

pillbox 08.19.16
It’s 7 a.m., and you are standing on the terrace of the 
nicest apartment you have ever, or probably will ever, 
be in — all big windows and white leather and glass. 
You are looking out over the sprawling city of Rio de 
Janeiro below you, the mountains dramatically rising up 
beyond the buildings, and the beautiful beach and ocean 
sweeping out to your left. You don’t think you’ve ever 
seen a city so breathtaking before.
It’s 12 p.m., and you are standing next to an open sewer 
in the heart of Rocinha, the largest favela in Brazil, 
looking at the houses that have been built directly over 
the sewer on stilts, accepting the stench as the price 
for ?nding a bit of open ground to build on. Your guide, 
Alberto, has lived in the favela for 50 years and seems to 
genuinely love the place. Turning somber, he says, “What 
you can’t see are the rats, this is hell.”
It’s 8 p.m., and you are sitting in Maracanã Stadium, 
waiting for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games Opening 
Ceremony to start. The lights of the stadium go out, and 
are replaced by thousands of cellphone lights that seem 
to ?ll the stands with stars. The music starts, and billions 
of people across the globe turn their eyes to Rio.
These are moments from my ?rst day at the Olympics in 
Rio de Janeiro this summer. A family friend, Kat Holmes, 
quali?ed as an épée fencer for the U.S. Olympic team. 
Excited and proud, my family rushed to get tickets for 
the games so we could support her achievement. When 
we arrived in Rio, we found a kaleidoscopic city that was 
almost impossible to make sense of and was made even 
more unfathomable by the Olympics.
Before heading to the Olympics, I knew a few things 
about Rio. I knew that Rio had a huge problem with 
income inequality, witnessed by the gorgeous high-
rise apartments along the beaches and desperately 
poor favelas clinging to the surrounding hills. I knew 
that crime, corruption, and political instability in the 
city had the Olympic committee on edge, wondering if 
these problems would affect the games. And I knew that 
almost everyone I mentioned the trip to made some sort 
of quip about stocking up on bug spray to combat Zika.
Most of these things turned out to be true, to some 
extent. (Except for the comments about Zika. I didn’t 
see a single mosquito the whole time I was there, and 
gave up on the bug spray two days in.) However, all of 
these aspects of the city were in?nitely more layered 
and complicated than how they were portrayed to me 
back in the U.S. For example, I had heard that the favelas 
are slums that are wracked with violence and whose 
inhabitants live in fear of the drug lords that control 
them. When Alberto showed us around Rocinha I saw 
a vibrant, close knit, desperately poor community that 
was hardworking, hopeful, and friendly, yet distrustful 
of outsiders, and most surprising of all, that trusted the 
drug lords more with their protection than the police.
Even when I was in Rio, I continued to experience this 
strange dissonance with what I heard from friends 
and the media at home in the states and what I was 
experiencing on the ground. I saw countless posts 
and articles about how unprepared Rio was for the 
Olympics, how shoddy the construction was, how 
tense and dif?cult it was to set up the games due to the 
current political climate, how the International Olympic 
Committee was doubting the ability of developing 
countries to host future Olympic games because of how 
much of a disaster Rio had been.
For my part, I saw a city full of people facing enormous 
dif?culties in the form of economic recession and 
political corruption who had decided to put aside 
their struggles for a few weeks to host the games as 
beautifully as they could. They did not let the Olympics 
distract or divert them from their ?ght to root out 
political corruption, but decided to go back to it after 
the games so they as a city could come together and 
put their best foot forward. Sure, the Rio games were 
not as shiny and perfect as a games hosted by a more 
prosperous nation, but that begs the question, should 
they have to be? The people of Rio made enormous 
sacri?ces to host the games, but despite these costs they 
greeted the games with an electric energy that made 
these Olympics truly one of a kind.
In the end, the truth of these situations is probably 
somewhere in between what I saw during my time there 
and what is widely known and reported in the United 
States. After all, I was only in Rio for two weeks, and it is 
a city that would take decades to understand. Still, my 
trip to Rio taught me to consume information about other 
countries with a more critical eye. The depictions we 
?nd in the newspaper are a mere shadow of the reality, 
and the truth is more complicated, confusing, vibrant, 
and simply more beautiful than we expect.

Canadians: 
“Yeah, I wasn’t really too sure what to expect, but I was 
surprised, you and the other Americans are so nice and 
normal!” 
Me:
“Ummm, thank you? Hahaha”
That was on day three of my time in Montreal. Well, not in 
Montreal, but about an hour outside at the Orford Music 
Center in Orford National Park. I was there for a music 
composition festival for two weeks with a population of 
students from around Canada, France, and America. In 
total I spent 30 hours in Montreal itself (including my hour 
and a half trek trying to ?nd the Gare d’autocars to catch 
my bus to Orford on the ?rst day. Oh, and I got on the 
wrong bus).
Montreal itself was fantastic! This city is one of the 
most beautiful, dynamic, and culturally rich cities I have 
been to and I will de?nitely be coming back (maybe for 
the Université de Montréal) even with the 9-months of 
complete ice age. But my most impactful experiences were 
in the middle of the Quebec forest-land with all of these 
people I had barely just met.
My roommate and I were the youngest composers there; 
we are both twenty, but he is six days older. We think we 
got put together because we were the two young composer 
dudes with long hair so they thought we’d get along. 
They were right. And I think it was only about 30 percent 
the hair. He was from Alberta, but goes to school at the 
University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. Apparently, Winnipeg 
is a very cool trendy city. I had no idea. I had to have one 
of the other composers explain to me what the differences 
between Saskatchewan and Manitoba were. He’s from 
Saskatchewan, but apparently there’s pretty much nothing 
there. Quite a few composers were from Montreal, one from 
British Columbia, one from Toronto, one from New York, 
one from Iran, one from Taiwan, and others.
The composers would all eat together in packs and chill in 
the pub, “Le Garage” (it was in fact a garage), in between 
running off to practice rooms to work out some sections of 
pieces they were frantically trying to ?nish. However, from 
the beginning I was of the mindset that I was there to make 
as much music and learn as much as I possibly could, not to 
make friends. Besides meals and seminars, I isolated myself 
to work. And work. And work. But somehow I noticed I 
was slowly being absorbed into this tight-knit group; all 
the composers would sit together at meals and concerts or 
to write music (or to watch X-Files, which the Canadians 
were weirdly in to). As I progressed through my cycles 
of inspiration and crippling self-doubt of music writing, 
I found that I was, in fact, making friends, even though I 
had speci?cally planned to avoid that. It was unfortunate 
for that original plan that all these people turned out to 
be really interesting and inspiring and challenging and 
irresistible as friends. We watched the shooting stars in a 
meadow in the forest, sung Karaoke of ABBA and Queen 
at “Le Garage,” ping ponged with the professors, and 
celebrated hard after the concert we had all been working 
for. As we were studying everyone’s music I found myself 
understanding more about what it meant to be human; and 
as we were hanging out I found myself understanding more 
about what it meant to make music.
When I told the Canadians that I was writing an article 
about my travels to the exotic land of Canada they instantly 
began suggesting that I had to tell everyone about 
how they all ride polar bears to get places and only eat 
moose?esh for every meal, I mean, that and poutine and 
maple syrup. Well, actually, the last two are pretty accurate: 
we were given a pitcher of maple syrup with every meal. A 
pitcher! And every fast food shop served poutine (it’s fries 
with cheese curds and gravy and it’s fantastic). Instead, 
I decided to write about what I learned from all these 
different personalities and varying cultural experiences 
about what it meant to be a composer (and sometimes 
being a composer means being attacked by moose if you’re 
Canadian).
My last day in Orford national park it was raining, but I 
had decided at the beginning of my weeks there that I 
would climb up Mont Orford once I was ?nally done with 
all the hours and existential self-doubt of the music and 
workshops and seminars and concerts and feedback 
sessions. It wasn’t just raining, it was pouring. And I also 
didn’t have a car. And the base of the mountain was seven 
miles away.
I rented a bike and trekked up the winding road to the 
mountain base and began the journey up the mountain 
already soaked. As I reached the top, emerging through the 
clouds of fog, I stood there in the damp grass barefoot and 
shirtless in the rain. 
After all was said and done, I was here overlooking the 
grey and green landscape in this moment and I thought. 
I had grown immensely as a composer and had made 
friends with all of these French speaking, polar bear riding, 
maple drinking Canadians and was thrilled to see what 
music everyone would make next. And hopefully I’d be 
returning to this moose ?lled tundra in the near future to 
see more amazing works by all these new-found friends and 
colleagues.

Head Orientation Counselors welcome ?rst years with fond memories
The following are excerpts from letters written by each of the Head Orientation Counsellors describing what orientation week means to them. They 
range from informative and exciting to deeply personal and heart warming and all offer insight into the best part of orientation week. 
Orientation was the ?rst thing that opened me 
up and integrated me into this school and city. 
Orientation made me feel comfortable and it 
introduced me to friends I would hold close 
throughout my time here. I hope this year’s 
orientation week can do the same for all of 
you! You will be challenged both socially and 
academically, meet many people from different 
cultures and backgrounds, and create memories 
that will last for the rest of your life. Get excited 
for orientation!
Keep your hearts and minds open to new and 
unfamiliar situations. Don’t be afraid to step out 
of your comfort zone once in a while. You never 
know what interesting opportunities await you.
David Ott — Stever House
Orientation is an action-packed week of 
events that give you a chance to meet your 
class, Carnegie Mellon, and the greater 
Pittsburgh area. Because of the energy brought 
by the student body and fresh invigorating 
environment, many Tartans look back on 
Orientation fondly as one of their top moments 
during their stay at Carnegie Mellon. You may 
meet your best friend during Orientation, be 
inspired to pursue a path that was previously 
unknown, or simply start to become acquainted 
with your dorm community and Carnegie 
Mellon’s incredible facilities.
These new experiences may come easy, which 
is incredibly inspiring to me. If moving to a new 
place gives you butter?ies, embrace the feeling 
and hold onto it, since that nervousness is what 
makes moments like Orientation special.
Evans Hauser — Donner House
Carnegie Mellon is a place where you can 
challenge yourself in so many ways. Not only 
do we have world-class academic programs, we 
are also a student community full of different 
people with different interests who are all 
heading down different paths, but we have one 
thing in common: this university. We (including 
you!) as students have the freedom to pursue 
our passions and discover what really gets us 
excited about life alongside some truly amazing 
classmates. For me one of those passions has 
been Orientation, so I cannot wait for you all to 
experience it with me.
As someone who has dedicated more time and 
heart to Orientation than any other program on 
campus, I would like to tell you that it is a time 
of self-discovery and class unity. If you truly 
allow yourself to step out of your comfort zone, 
you are going to meet so many new people and 
I can assure you that you will be inspired by the 
unparalleled passion of your peers. Orientation 
gave me the feeling of support and community 
that has driven me to make the most of my time 
here at Carnegie Mellon. I hope you will allow it 
to do that for you as well.
Josh Zak — Residence on Fifth
I grew up about 45 minutes away from Carnegie 
Mellon, which made it seem like moving a 
relatively short distance wouldn’t be a big 
change. However, leaving home is leaving home 
no matter how short or long the distance, so it’s 
a huge adjustment for everyone. My fears began 
to ease after my ?rst night of Orientation as I 
started to feel comfortable in my new “home,” 
and the week turned out to be one of my most 
de?ning Carnegie Mellon experiences.
Orientation is the perfect environment to take a 
?rst step out of your comfort zone and become 
part of the unique and very welcoming Carnegie 
Mellon community!
Laurel Beatty — Mudge House
If you’re feeling a bit scared about life away 
from home, I can tell you that I was feeling the 
exact same way four years ago. I was a nervous-
wreck coming to college. I was terri?ed of never 
?nding friends, never ?tting in, never ?nding 
a major I was passionate about, and almost 
everything else that comes with going away 
to college.  However, I can honestly say that 
buying into orientation was the best decision 
I made. Putting myself out there and being 
myself openly in front of everyone I met that 
week helped me learn to never underestimate 
the importance and the great reward that 
comes with showing everyone who I was. 
Carnegie Mellon is a beautifully diverse place, 
and coming here with an open mind will take 
you farther than you could imagine. Be open 
minded with yourself and everyone you meet in 
order to get the most out of your orientation and 
college experience.
Mya Snyder — Morewood E-Tower
So here you are, fresh-faced and bushy-tailed — 
and nervous, no doubt — ready to embark on a 
journey that no one, maybe not even you, knows 
where it leads. But if I may, allow me to give you 
some tips for the road ahead that I wish I had 
when I began my adventure. One, be fearless. 
You’ll hear it over and over again, but college 
is a time when you should be tearing down 
walls, not putting them up; college is a time 
when your comfort zone triples and quadruples 
in size; college is a time when you realize the 
full potential of what living in this world means, 
so embrace the challenge and push yourself 
to explore and experience.  Two, don’t forget 
the details. Put your heart, mind, and soul into 
even the smallest acts. It’s those small acts that 
remind us why it’s important to stay healthy, be 
happy, and reach for success. And third, laugh. 
Every day. Take pride in what you do and where 
you are and never forget that a smile is one 
of the most powerful gestures. It can provide 
comfort, deal forgiveness, lift spirits, and start 
relationships.
But perhaps most importantly, prepare 
yourselves for a whirlwind ?rst week at 
Carnegie Mellon. Orientation is the launch 
pad for all your college careers, and, make no 
mistake, by the end of the week you will all be 
ready to lift off.
Nikhil Nilakantan — Residences on the Hill
I remember when I ?rst moved in and all of the 
anxieties I had about what college would bring 
for me. I was nervous that I would be way too 
overwhelmed by everything, I was worried that 
my transition to college wouldn’t be smooth, 
and I wasn’t even sure if Carnegie Mellon was 
the right school for me. Although I had all these 
apprehensions, I quickly learned that almost 
everyone else had similar feelings, and that I 
was not alone in my thoughts. I soon became 
a part of an incredible campus community 
that valued me just as much as I valued it. 
Through all of the people that I interacted with 
and experiences that I had during Orientation 
and my ?rst year here, I realized that I had 
developed an amazing support system and 
newfound sense of my place within this 
community.
Niko Torres — Residences on the Hill

8SoCal
pillbox 08.19.16
I landed at LAX all alone three months ago with way too 
little planning, way too much stuff, and no idea what 
to expect. I was more nervous than I ever remember 
being — going into my ?rst ‘real’ job in a city I knew 
nothing about and staying with people I had never met 
before. I remember waiting ?fteen minutes for my Uber 
to navigate the moronathon that is LAX traf?c and trying 
to keep all the things that could possibly go wrong out 
of my mind. In the end, nothing went wrong. Instead, 
I think I had the coolest, most enlightening, and most 
downright crazy summer of my life.
I stayed and worked in Irvine, a small city just outside 
LA with perfect, wide roads, gleaming towers, and an 
almost creepy standard of cleanliness and organization. 
Eventually, I found out that a private company, creatively 
named Irvine Company, owns most of the city and keeps 
everything in perfect shape so that they can charge their 
tenants astronomical rents. This is all the more jarring 
when contrasted with the rest of SoCal — wild and 
messy, but with a swagger that brings a certain charm 
to the chaos.
At ?rst glance, it can seem like everything is king size 
in SoCal. The malls are so big it can take thirty minutes 
to walk from corner to corner. The distances between 
places are so vast you can forget about walking or 
cycling anywhere. Pretty much everyone I met had a 
car and spent around an hour in it everyday. Speaking 
of people, everyone works out a lot, eats even more, and 
perfect bodies (much to my chagrin) are more the norm 
than the exception.
And yet, the greatest pleasures are had in the little 
things that you ?nd. I visited more beaches, bars, and 
bowling alleys in my two and a half months in SoCal than 
I have in my time at college so far — and the best ones 
were tucked away in little corners, only discoverable 
by recommendation. The really interesting bars are 
dark, tiny, noisy, and with the kind of live blues music 
that makes you want to dance on the tables. As for the 
beaches, there are plenty of iconic beaches in the region, 
from Venice to Santa Monica to Newport. But the truly 
great ones, with perfect white sand, clear blue water and 
waves that are just high enough to be fun yet safe, are 
less well known. A personal favorite was Crescent Bay. 
It is a little out of the way, but if you happen to visit the 
area, I couldn’t recommend it enough.
I was surprised by how different the ‘west coast’ 
mindset can be from Pittsburgh and New York, the two 
U.S. cities that I’ve spent time in. There really is no other 
way to say it, people are just more fun in SoCal. There’s 
a certain spontaneity in the air that makes everyone 
more suggestible to the sort of crazy ideas that become 
the stuff of memories. This one Sunday night, a bunch of 
friends and I decided to sample every In-N-Out Burger 
in a ?fteen mile radius to gauge the ‘consistency of their 
offerings.’ I got home eight burgers and ?ve thousand 
calories later at 2 a.m. I regretted it the next day at work, 
but I haven’t regretted it since.
Another weekend that really stands out is this one time 
a bunch of us decided to go camping and trekking at 
Ortega Oaks, a forest about a hundred miles outside 
the city. For most of us it was our ?rst time camping, 
and what ensued was a comedy of errors that somehow 
managed to come together into an incredible adventure. 
The ?rst day that we went trekking, we thoroughly 
underestimated the amount of water a twelve mile trek 
through the arid California wilderness requires. As a 
result, we ran out when we had about eight miles left on 
our way back. By the time we got back to our campsite, 
I was so exhausted and dehydrated I must’ve taken 
about a gallon of water from a stream nearby. Later that 
evening, we did the most cliched campsite activity of 
all — lit a ?re and sat around making s’mores and telling 
horror stories. That night, I slept on a hammock for the 
?rst time in my life. It was uncomfortable and noisy, 
and I didn’t sleep much. But the view was absolutely 
worth it. The night sky, as seen from the forest, away 
from all the pollution, is a sight to behold. The night was 
cloudless and it seemed like every star in the galaxy was 
?ghting for my attention, if only to remind me of all of our 
insigni?cance in the universe.
Leaving all this last week was much more dif?cult than 
I would have ever expected it to be. The friends I made, 
the things I did, and the places I visited have changed 
me for good and for the better. You can take me out of 
SoCal, but I doubt you’ll ever take the SoCal out of me.
