Conference highlights women
By MICHELLE W. CHAO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
At the end of last year’s Mo­
saic, the first annual conference 
on women, Kerri Ullucci, the 
organizer and founder of the 
event, stated that she hoped the 
effects of the conference would 
be positive and long-lasting. This 
year’s organizers continued this 
mission of increasing campus 
awareness of women’s issues.
Mosaic was held last Satur­
day by the Office of Student 
Life. Drawing around 200 
people and 25 guest speakers, 
the half-day event brought the 
CMU community together for a 
formal discussion of a variety of 
women’s issues.
Ullucci returned to attend this 
year’s conference. “[This con­
ference has] addressed lots of 
issues that we didn’t talk about 
last time,” she said. “I also saw 
many guys here, attending this 
conference. I hope that those 
who are here today will share 
the information that they 
learned with their friends, part­
ners, and family.”
Ullucci worked to realize her 
vision of a women’s conference 
two years ago when she pre­
sented a proposal to various 
University administrative bod­
ies. Her goal was to accumulate 
financial and organizational

support for the event. The level 
of administrative interest in 
Ullucci’s idea was high, as 
shown by the fact that Student 
Affairs, Student Life, the 
President’s Office, and every 
undergraduate department ex­
cept the School of Computer 
Science supported the confer­
ence. This year, SCS and all of 
last year’s supporters helped 
sponsor the event.
This year’s Mosaic planning 
committee was more flexible in 
its membership than last year’s. 
Christina Lopez, a senior psy­
chology major and a gender is­
sues intern with the Office of 
Student Life, was the chair of 
this year’s Mosaic. “We didn’t 
have the six-person conference
planning committee,” Lopez said. 
“We welcomed whoever was in­
terested and enthusiastic about 
the Mosaic.” The committee also 
consulted last year’s organizers 
because of their valuable experi­
ence planning the event. Lopez 
plans to return for next year’s 
Mosaic, replacing Ullucci as the 
closing speaker in what may be­
come a Mosaic tradition.
Last year’s organizers had 
identified a small number of 
things that they would like to 
see handled differently in sub­
sequent conferences. One of their 
concerns was that more of a va­
riety of activities needed to be 
offerred. Organizers this year 
attempted to solve this problem

Hackers sabotage computers
By DANIEL ARP
Tartan Contributing Editor
When ah unknown hacker 
sent confusing information over 
the Internet, computers running 
Windows 95 and NT operating 
systems crashed at CMU and 
other locations across the coun­
try last Sunday and Monday.
Only Windows computers not 
equipped with a certain software 
patch were affected by the at­
tack. Those that were struck — 
including most of the computers 
in the Cyert cluster and many in
the dorms — reacted in one of 
two ways: by simply freezing or 
displaying the “blue screen of 
death,” according to John 
Lerchey, senior consultant of 
User Services. In both cases, com­
puters could be rebooted with­
out any further effects.
“I would call it a major annoy­
ance,” said Lerchey. “There was 
no real damage done. No data 
was lost.... It’s irritating; it’s an­
noying; it’s a pain in the butt. But 
it’s not something I would call the 
FBI about.”
The hacker or hackers appar-
ently used a modified version of a 
crashing program called Tear­
drop 2, which sends a packet of 
information overthe network that 
the computer receiving the infor­
mation cannot handle.
“In the network, you’re con­
stantly sending packets. In gen­
eral, that’s how communication 
takes place,” said Meena 
Lakhavani, director of User Ser­
vices. In this case, she said, the 
Windows computers were re­
ceiving information that was in­
consistent with what the oper-

During its 1990 search for the 
seventh University president, 
Carnegie Mellon administrators 
and faculty examined CMU’s 
goals and strengths as an educa­
tional institution, creating the 
1990 Strategic Plan. Now, eight 
years later and under the admin­
istration of CMU’s eighth presi­
dent, a new strategic plan is in 
the works for future generations 
of CMU students and faculty.
The strategic plan, which is 
guided by the University’s over­
all vision and mission state­
ments, outlines long-term goals
for different areas of the 
University’s operations. These 
areas range from educational 
goals to building projects to in­
volving the University with the 
Pittsburgh community.
As a part of creating the new 
strategic plan and in conjunc­
tion with the recent Middle 
States Accreditation review, 
CMU’s administration recently 
held a series of town meetings 
to allow students and faculty 
to comment on the .plan. 
The town meeting discussion 
format, which the University of­
ten uses to solicit feedback from 
the campus community, is an 
outgrowth of the current strate­
gic plan, as are many other com­
mon campus procedures. .-"
The current plan: making a 
difference
When CMU established its first 
strategic plan eight years ago, 
the Selections and Plans Com­
mittee identified a number of con­
ditions about the University that 
demanded attention. These con­
ditions included fundamental 
changes in University spending, 
development, educational policy, 
and research.
One of the key areas where the 
University has focused its atten­
tions has been education. As a 
result of the current plan, CMU 
instituted the current incarna­
tion of the Modern Languages 
Department, the First Year Part­
nership Program, the Small Un-

The University Academic Calendar 
Committee (UACC) voted on February 
19 to move next year’s spring break two 
weeks earlier in the semester, from the 
11th week of the semester to the ninth 
week. If the change is approved by Uni­
versity President Jared Cohon and Pro­
vost Paul Christiano, spring break will 
move from March 23-27,1999 to March 
9-13, 1999. This means midsemester 
break will move to a later and, as of yet, 
unspecified date.
“One of the advantages of [moving 
spring break] was to allow mini-courses 
to have a separation in the middle of the 
semester,” said John Papinchak, UACC 
chair and co-director of Enrollment Ser­
vices. “There was concern of continuity 
in learning experience. The feeling was 
that the week [after the end of the thrid 
mini course and the beginning of spring 
break] would be wasted.”
Carnegie Mellon currently has three 
separate calendars for GSIA, Heinz, and 
the rest of the University. In an attempt 
to develop one calendar, the UACC de­
cided to move spring break earlier so 
that it would fall between mini-courses 
three and four, and not in the middle of 
mini-course four.
“I don’t agree with it,” said senior 
technical writing and computer science 
major Deanna--Rubin. “I can see the 
arguments for why it would be good to 
more evenly split the semester with 
spring break, but most people seem just 
fine with where it is. Where spring break 
is now makes sense; it gives you a little 
bit of a rest before Spring Carnival, 
which is really needed.”
Amy Ng, chair of Senate’s Academic 
Affairs Committee, said that the deci­
sion is unfair to many undergraduates, 
even though the decision may be suit­
able for GSIA and Heinz students.
“The proportion of undergraduates 
who take mini-semester courses isn’t 
too great,” she said, adding that there 
are approximately 70 mini-courses
offered, about half of which are 
physical education courses. Papinchak 
said that the University will be 
increasing the number of minis that 
it offers, particularly the number that 
are open to undergraduates.
“Both Amy Ng and myself argued 
against this plan,” said Student Body 
President Bryon Krug. “However, we 
were quite frankly outnumbered by the 
administration and faculty on the Aca­
demic Calendar Committee.” Krug still 
believes, however, that there remains a 
chance to reverse the decision, and he 
said, that Student Senate will continue 
to oppose the plan.
In response to the student opposition, 
Papinchak pointed out that the UACC is 
sensitive to student opinion. “We are 
certainly going to take student opinion 
into consideration. Nothinghas been set 
yet. There is no final decision on any­
thing,” says Papinchak. Initially, the 
UACC decided to use spring break as a 
midsemester break and eliminate the 
extra day that students currently have 
for amidsemester break. However, upon 
considering resolutions from Student 
Senate, the UACC compromised and 
moved the one day break to a later date 
in the semester.
“There are a lot of things to consider,” 
said Christiano. “There were a number 
of options, including some that have not 
been explored thoroughly. A final deci­
sion hasn’t been made.”
Additionally, the UACC proposed last 
Thursday to make changes to the fall 
semester calendar, effective for the fall 
1998 semester. The changes would in­
clude adding one day to fall midsemester 
break, creating a four-day weekend, and 
adding a week to the end of the semes­
ter. Thus, the last day of final exams for 
the fall 1998 semester would be on De­
cember 22 instead of December 15. Both 
Ng and Krug have voiced opposition to 
this change but note that it is a separate 
issue from the spring calendar changes.
The administration will be holding a 
town meeting this Wednesday at 4:30 
pm to listen to student feedback.

Computing center receives grant
By GIL ALTEROVTTZ
Tartan Senior Staffivriter
The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Cen­
ter (PSC) has been awarded a contract 
with the Department of Energy (DOE) 
to serve as a computational resource for 
its Accelerated Strategic Computing Ini­
tiative (ASCI). The ASCI program, which 
simulates complex physical systems, in­
cludes five universities (CalTech, 
Stanford University, the University of 
Chicago, the University of Illinois, and 
the University of Utah) and the PSC, 
which is jointly managed by Carnegie 
Mellon University and the University of 
Pittsburgh. The DOE’s goal is to apply 
the program’s knowledge toward simu­
lating and verifying the reliability and
safety of the country’s nuclear stockpile 
in the absence of underground nuclear 
testing. However, as part of the ASCI 
program serviced by the PSC, there will 
be no classified work done at the Center.
The PSC has long been a resource for 
supercomputer users across the nation. 
“Sometimes doing just a little more is 
the difference between success and fail­
ure in a computation,” said Michael 
Levine, Scientific Director at thje Pitts­
burgh Supercomputing Center. In addi­
tion, the Center is important for the 
region and Carnegie Mellon in terms of 
jobs, bringing in top faculty, and attract­
ing smart students.
The $4.5 million contact is part of a 
long-term relationship between the DOE 
and Carnegie Mellon University, with
several potential funding phases. This 
is great news for the Center, which lost 
its single largest source of funds from 
the National Science Foundation (NSF) 
this past fall. “The question was do we go 
out of business or get funding from some­
body else?” said Vice Provost for Re­
search Duane Adams. Previously, the 
PSC was one of four NSF supercomput­
ing centers. Under the former contract, 
the PSC received $15 million annually 
from the NSF. Of the four former NSF 
centers, the one at Cornell University 
also lost its funding.
Consequently, the Cornell center has 
been facing issues similar to the PSC’s 
current issues. “[The Cornell center is] 
providing service for Cornell and maybe

Clinton pushes for tobacco legislation
WASHINGTON (AP) - Counting 
down the days left in this Congress, 
President Clinton opened his push 
for anti-tobacco legislation Saturday 
by challenging lawmakers to act now 
and penalize cigarette companies for 
hooking kids.
Republicans responded that illegal 
drugs are “an even greater threat” 
than tobacco and accused Clinton of 
negligence on that problem.
“There will be no greater measure of 
your commitment to the health of our 
children,” the President told Congress 
in his weekly radio address, broadcast 
shortly before he and First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton went to Camp 
David for a weekend getaway.
“Today there are as few as 70 work­
ing days left before this Congress ad­
journs,” Clinton said. “On every one of 
those days, 3,000 children will light 
their first cigarettes. On every one of 
those days, this Congress has the op­
portunity to stop it.” Of those 3,000 
young first-time smokers, about 1,000 
will die prematurely of smoking-re­
lated causes, he said. “This is a na­
tional tragedy that eveiy American 
should be honor-bound to prevent:”
Representative Tom Bliley, who, as 
chairman of the Commerce Commit­
tee primarily controls House action on 
tobacco policy, chafed at Clinton’s 
reproval. And, responding in the Re­
publicans’ radio address, Michigan 
Senator Spencer Abraham noted that 
drug use among 10th graders has 
doubled in the last seven years.
“The president has finally submit­
ted a long-range, national drug strat­
egy to Congress. It has taken him 
nearly five years to begin action. And 
as the numbers show, our children are 
paying the price,” Abraham said.
On tobacco, “if the President wants 
a quick resolution, as I do, he should
remain in Washington until he sends 
us his specific plan for action,” Bliley, 
R-Va., said in a statement Friday. 
“Many of us question his commitment” 
to tobacco legislation, Bliley said.
The president’s, radio broadcast 
marked the first installment of a 
stepped-up campaign by the White 
House for tobacco legislation, now 
stalled in Congress. Clinton is sched­
uled to press the issue this week in 
speeches to the American Medical As­
sociation and the state attorneys gen­
eral who, through dozens of lawsuits 
against cigarette makers, have been 
on the front lines of negotiating a policy.
Senate committee chairmen agreed 
last week to scrap a March 16 deadline 
for their own individual bills and in­
stead begin work next Wednesday on 
folding various proposals into one bill.
McCain, R-Ariz., will direct the effort 
from his post at the helm of the Com­
merce panel, which will also hear from 
health groups, the tobacco industry, 
and the administration before it begins 
to finalize the bill March 25. Lament­
ing the process as “unwieldy,” he has 
said any tobacco measure is unlikely to 
come to the Senate floor for a vote 
before Congress recesses for Easter.
The House lags even further behind, 
although Speaker Newt Gingrich in­
dicated last week that he expects Con­
gress to pass some form of tobacco 
legislation this year.
Under the June settlement between 
the tobacco industiy and state attor­
neys general, cigarette prices would 
increase and tobacco companies would 
pay $368 billion over 25 years. They 
would also agree to curb advertising 
practices believed to be aimed at young 
smokers. In exchange, the attorneys 
general would drop 40 state lawsuits, 
and the industry would be protected 
from most other lawsuits as well.
China downsizes 
state bureaucracy
BEIJING (AP) - The Communist 
Party proposed cutting China’s 8 mil­
lion-strong bureaucracy by half Friday 
with ambitious reforms aimed at curb­
ing waste, corruption, and state med­
dling in business.
The reforms are part of China’s effort 
to fend off the economic crises afflicting 
other Asian countries and spur flagging 
economic growth by ridding the economy 
of the last traces of central planning.
“The government is handling many 
affairs it should not handle, cannot 
handle, or could not handle well,” Luo 
Gan, the chief administrator of the Cabi­
net, told China’s legislature.
The sweeping overhaul, reportedly 
drafted by top economic policy-maker 
and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, calls for 
the elimination of 11 out of 40 govern­
ment ministries and commissions.
The ministries of electric power, petro­
leum, and chemicals would become state- 
owned corporations, in keeping with 
ambitions to develop internationally com­
petitive industries. It also would create 
agencies to promote advanced technol­
ogy, such as the Defense Science and 
Technology Industries Commission and 
the Information Industiy Ministry; Over­
all, the goal of the reforms was to improve 
government efficiency and to “establish a 
corps of high-quality experts” suitable for 
a modem economy, Luo said.
“Overstaffing is severe. This tends to 
promote red tape and bureaucratism, 
and foster corruption and unhealthy 
practices,” he said.
Also Friday, officials announced a 1998 
government budget that increases mili­
tary spending by 12.8 percent to $11 
billion. The growing defense budget in 
recent years has unnerved neighbors 
worried about 'China’s expanding 
military power.
Like most major decisions, the 
government’s overhaul was agreed-upon 
in advance by the top leadership and is 
almost certain to be approved by the 
congress. But the leadership appeared 
to have sought to limit debate by pre­
senting the plan Friday and requiring a 
vote by next Tuesday.
The urgency of reforms has increased 
as China’s economic growth has sagged
— to 8.8 percent last year from 9.6 
percent in 1996 — while the
financial crises in other Asian coun­
tries have cast a pall over prospects for 
export growth.
Much of China’s bureaucracy was cre­
ated back when officials handled every­
thing from setting prices to assigning 
housing and issuing ration tickets. Civil 
servants have far less to do now that 
market reforms have freed the economy 
from direct government intervention.
Reforms will face strong opposition 
from well-entrenched, privileged bureau­
crats, who sabotaged similar efforts in 
the 1980s.
Wang Quanshu, a legislator from cen­
tral Henan province, said the adminis­
trative reform was necessary, but cau­
tioned that past experience was no cause 
for optimism. “Administrative reform 
has been tried many times before. Every 
time the bureaucracy is reformed, it 
expands. It’s reform, expansion, reform, 
expansion,” he said.
Legislators allow 
eating of roadkill
CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - West 
Virginia motorists who run down the odd 
critter can legally take it home for dinner 
under a law passed by the Legislature.
The bill, which has made West Vir­
ginia the butt of jokes nationally, would 
let drivers keep their road kill provided 
they report it to conservation or police 
officers within 12 hours.
The measure became law when Gov­
ernor Cecil Underwood declined to veto 
it by a Thursday deadline.
Pro-road kill legislators envision 
people eating deer hit on the road, but 
the bill allows drivers to take home any 
wildlife, except protected birds, spotted 
fawn, or bear cubs.
Proponents said if drivers can be en­
couraged to eat their road kill, the state 
could save money it now pays state Divi­
sion of Highways workers to remove the 
dead animals.
Current law allows people to take pos­
session of road kill only after they’ve 
contacted authorities. By then the meat 
has spoiled, said supporters.
FedEx institutes 
Sunday delivery
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - Federal 
Express began Sunday package deliver­
ies this weekend,- reflecting a trend to­
ward seven-day-a-week work weeks in 
America. Sunday deliveries began in 50 
of the largest U.S. cities with an eye 
toward expansion.
“Our customers have asked us to do 
this,” said David Shoenfeld, FedEx vice 
president for marketing.
The Sunday deliveries, for overnight 
express, are primarily aimed at busi­
ness customers. There is a $20 sur­
charge and arrival is guaranteed by 3 
pm. The shipments will be covered by 
the company’s standard money-back 
guarantee and its 24-hour package 
tracking system,
Art Hatfield, a market analyst with 
Morgan Keegan & Co., said FedEx al­
ready has the airplanes, trucks, and 
other equipment needed to handle the 
new deliveries.
“There’s no capital to be invested in 
doing something like this. All you’re go­
ing to have is the variable cost of people 
working on those days,” Hatfield said.
“I don’t think there’s a lot of risk in 
doing something like this. If it doesn’t 
work out, they can easily back off.”
Schoenfeld said FedEx has changed 
schedules for package sorting and flights 
to accommodate the extra day of delivery.
FedEx expects Sunday deliveries to 
attract companies working seven days a 
week as well as those needing supplies 
or equipment in place to begin the work 
week on Monday.
“Our customers tell us this is a service 
they need. That’s a good thing for us, 
and a much tougher thing for our com­
petitors,” Shoenfeld said.
“At present, we’re the only air express 
company that’s doing thfs on a regular 
basis, though certainly there are some 
specialized and pricey courier services 
that can do it.”
Water on moon could sustain first extraterrestrial colony
WASHINGTON (AP) - Be­
cause of the discovery of water on 
the moon, Americans could be 
living in a permanent lunar base
— the first outpost beyond the 
Earth — in as little as a decade, a 
NASA scientist says.
The space agency announced 
Thursday that an orbiting robot 
craft has discovered there may be 
enough water on the moon to one 
day support a human colony there 
and to use the lunar base as a 
rocket fueling station for explo­
ration into deep space.
“This means that human life 
, could expand to the moon,” said a 
jubilant Alan Binder, lead scien­
tist for the Lunar Prospector.
With water available, he said, it 
would be possible to start building 
a moon base in eight to 10 years 
and have a partially self-support­
ing colony within 15 years.
“We could do it even faster if 
we pushed it,” Binder told report­
ers. The water is now available 
and the technology can be devel­
oped, he said, but there would 
have to be a national decision to 
tackle the project.
Binder and other scientists said 
Lunar Prospector had found evi­
dence of frozen underground pools 
in the dark, cold shade of deep 
craters at the lunar poles.
“We are certain there is water 
there,” said Binder. “We think we 
are seeing between 10 million 
and 100 million tons of water. 
For the first time, we may be able 
to go to another space body and 
fuel up,” said Binder.
Preliminary estimates indicate 
that the moon holds enough wa­
ter, in widely separated depos­
its, to fill a lake two miles square 
and 35 feet deep, Binder said.
But he cautioned that the 
amount of water still was just a 
rough estimate.
The Lunar Prospector, a $65 
million robot craft, was launched 
in January and has spent the 
past seven weeks orbiting the 
moon and taking readings of the 
moon’s surface with radar and 
other instruments.
Water was discovered by an 
instrument that measures the 
speed at which neutrons bounce 
off materials on and near the lu­
nar surface. The neutrons come 
from natural cosmic rays that 
constantly smash into the moon. 
They are slowed when they strike 
atoms of hydrogen, the element 
that combines with oxygen to 
make water.
Slowing of the neutrons leaves 
a “water signature” in the neu- 
tron-measuring instrument.
William Feldman, an Energy 
Department scientist and one 
of the original inventors of 
spacefaring neutron detectors, 
said the conclusions about wa­
ter were based on a month’s 
worth of data and should be 
called “preliminary.”
But he said it was quite clear 
there were dense deposits of hy­
drogen atoms at the lunar poles. 
From this, he believed “the evi­
dence of water ice is quite strong.” 
Scientists will get a better idea 
of how much water is on the moon 
and where it is deposited as the 
Lunar Prospector continues its 
orbital exploration. The spacecraft 
will collect data for at least an­
other year. Toward the end of its 
mission, it will be lowered from its 
current 60-mile orbit to about six 
miles, giving scientists a close-up 
look at possible water deposits.
But scientists will not be able 
to confirm that the hydrogen at­
oms detected by the spacecraft 
are actually locked in water, 
and not in some exotic ice or 
rock deposit, until a sample 
of the material is scooped up 
and analyzed.
But Feldman said “water is the 
most stable form of hydrogen” 
and the most likely form to be on 
the moon.
The agency has no immediate 
plans to make a moon landing. 
But Lewis Peach, a National 
Aeronautics and Space Adminis­
tration executive, said the agency 
has long-range goals that include 
landings on both the moon 
and Mars.
The agency wants to learn how 
to exploit extraterrestrial re­
sources, such as the moon’s wa­
ter and the carbon dioxide in
Mars’ atmosphere, to make the 
exploration cheaper and faster.
Binder said it is believed the 
moon was dry when it first formed 
some four billion years ago. All of 
the water that is there, he said, 
probably was deposited by icy 
comets and asteroids smashing 
into the nioon over the past two 
billion years.
Based on this history, Feldman 
estimated there may be 11 mil­
lion to 330 million tons of water 
frozen in soil near the lunar poles.
Although comets and asteroids 
struck everywhere on the moon, 
only the poles are cold enough — 
about minus 180 degrees Fahr­
enheit — for the water to stay put 
as ice. During lunar noon, tem­
peratures at the equator can get 
up to. 250 degrees Fahrenheit, 
hot enough for any water to boil 
off and disappear into space.

FIVE YEARS AGO, March 8, 
1993 — Then-candidate for mayor 
of Pittsburgh Tom Murphy spoke 
to CMU students at his student 
campaign office in Oakland. The 
candidate focused his comments 
to,issues affecting students, ad­
dressing safety concerns in the 
Oakland area and explaining his 
plans to create employment op­
portunities after education for 
Pittsburgh’s university students. 
Murphy was successful in his 
mayoral bid and was re-elected 
to the office last November.
ONE YEAR AGO, March 10, 
1997 — In order to spread aware­
ness about the millions of political 
prisoners around the world, Am­
nesty International (AI) staged a 
mock kidnapping of electrical and
chemical engineering professor 
Indira Nair. Four masked men 
stormed into one of her classes in 
Porter Hall, and whisked her away 
to “captivity” at Gullifty’s restau­
rant in Squirrel Hill, where she 
had lunch with members of AI 
before returning to campus for a 
press conference lecture.
The kidnapping, however, 
raised panic , along with aware­
ness across the CMU community, 
as angry students accosted AI 
members, confused faculty took 
to the telephones, and the admin­
istration considered disciplinary 
action against AI. In the end how­
ever, Campus Police, who had 
been notified of the kidnapping 
by AI prior to the event, made all 
concerned aware of the truth be­
hind the matter.

Administration plans new University goals
PLAN, from page 1
dergraduate Researh Grant 
program, and the Bjchelor of 
Humanities and Art degree.
“A lot has been accmplished 
from the Univ^rsiy’s 1991 
planning effort,”'saii Vice Pro­
vost for Education H Ko. “For 
example, one of the ighest pri­
orities identified ajthat time 
was to improve the indergradu- 
ate educational ¿cperience. 
Since then, we hav<seen many 
educational initiates at the 
department, colleg, and Uni­
versity levels. Ourrecommen- 
dations have led t| an End-of- 
First-Year survey additional 
support for teaching assistants,
and new program 
Development. Ab' 
work has increase 
ness of the campu: 
towards the spec 
first-year student 
A key issue with
n Academic 
ve all, our 
the aware- 
community 
al needs of
urrent edu­
cation objectives oithe Univer­
sity is interdiscipknary s.ud- 
ies. The crux of thisproblen as 
the administration sees t is 
that in order to alloy stud ¡nts 
more openness in their co rse 
selection, the quality of ore 
academic programs migh be 
compromised. Current sugges­
tions for finding a balanc in­
clude increasing the numb r of 
seminar classes, which wuld 
allow students to expancthe 
breadth of their general kr )wl- 
edge and still maintain cpth 
in their studies.
Planning for a new er;
As the University’s adminis­
tration completed the go as set 
forth in the 1991 plan -Jsuch 
as building the Universit Cen­
ter, beginning constructim on 
the Purnell Center for thl Arts, 
and kicking the centenni I capi­
tal campaign into high ear — 
the 1991 plan has becore out­
moded, precipitating tb cur­
rent creation of a néw pan.
Carnegie Mellon has ècided 
to retain past strategii plan­
ning prerogatives in tie new 
plan. These include cafe goals 
of bettering education, re­
search, and the transfer of the 
University’s accomplshments
to society. The actual imple­
mentation of initiatives, how­
ever, is a major point in the 
current planning. Overall, ad­
ministrators are optimistic 
about the success of the future 
strategic plan.
“Carnegie Mellon is noted for 
effective strategic planning 
among universities,” said Chris 
Hendrickson, chair of the Edu­
cational Initiatives Committee. 
“This past seven years has seen 
major changes to the physical 
infrastructure, such as the Uni­
versity Center, and in educa­
tional programs such as the 
new undergraduate major in 
Computer Science. These are 
major successes.”
The goals of the University 
for research will be to focus on 
specific areas and strive for a 
superior reputation in those ar­
eas. Participants in the town 
meeting raised concern about 
Carnegie Mellon’s dedication to 
research versus its desire to 
strengthen its classroom cur­
riculum. Representatives for 
CMU said that it is important to 
recognize that research and ar­
tistic creation are prime vehicles 
of education, especially at the 
graduate level, where the train­
ing of future leaders is commen­
surate to the research itself.
The third and final core goal 
of the University ranges from 
campus construction to the es­
tablishment of a more diverse 
student body. The construction 
of the University Center and 
the establishment of Oversight 
Committees for both the 
Women’s Commission and the 
Underrepresented Minorities 
Commission are noteworthy ad­
vancements in terms of the Uni­
versity community.
“Since we are right in the 
middle of the planning, it is very 
hard to tell [how effective the 
current planning will be]. Cer­
tainly this process has opened 
new dialogues and communica­
tions on campus which will be 
helpful,” said Hendrickson.

PSC will study nuclear weapons decay
Center receives multi-million dollar government grant
PSC, from page 1
for the state of New York,” said 
Levine. “They have become 
what we call a state center, 
[whereas] our goal is to serve 
the national community.”
Levine noted, however, that the 
NSF was not the only source of 
funds. Over the years, the PSC 
has been funded by the Depart­
ment of Defense, the National 
Institute of Standards and Tech­
nology, the National Institutes of 
Health, the state of Pennsylva­
nia, and numerous corporations. 
However, with the phasing out of 
NSF funding in a couple of 
months, the Center had been look­
ing for additional funding sources.
“We will have to find one or 
more additional major sponsors 
like [the DOE] in the future in 
order to maintain [the Center’s] 
capabilities,” said Provost Paul 
Christiano. Ideally, the PSC 
would like to get funding from a 
large government agaency whose 
users would use our facility, ac­
cording to Christiano.
Despite the change in benefac­
tors, the PSC will not change its 
focus. “The work under the DOE 
is very much like the work of the 
NSF, so this does not constitute a 
sort of profound change in direc­
tion,” said Levine. The DOE con­
tract wil fund the same two func­
tions that the NSF sponsorship 
funded: service and research.
The PSC also announced this 
past week that it won $2.7 mil­
lion in funding from the NSF for 
establishing a national center for 
network engineering. This new 
funding is unrelated to the PSC’s 
loss of NSF center status last fall. 
The Center will serve a role in the 
further development of the very 
high performance Backbone Net­
work Service (VBNS), a network 
connecting institutions and 
supercomputing centers which is 
isolated from the Internet and is 
also up tp two orders of magni­
tude faster. The current speed of 
VBNS (622 million bits per sec­
ond) allows for the complete trans­
mission of the Encyclopedia 
Britannica in under 10 seconds.
“The future of the PSC ... is 
complicated. Who knows? It’s cer­
tainly our intention to continue 
this type of work,” said Levine.
Corrections/Clarifications...

ating system was programmed to expect.
“The packet coming in lied about itself, and the 
program believed it,” said Walter Wong, a sys­
tems development manager. “What you’re doing 
is you’re tricking the computer.”
Other educational institutions affected by the 
attack were MIT, Northwestern, the University 
of Minnesota and University of California cam­
puses in Berkeley, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San 
Diego. Navy computers in Point Loma, Charles­
ton, SC, and Norfolk VA were also struck.
Though those responsible have not been found,
Lerchey said CMU officials had tentatively tracked 
the source of the hack to locations in France and 
the Midwestern United States.
Patches that will prevent Windows machines 
from being affected by Teardrop 2 attacks have 
"been installed in the cluster computers and have 
been made available for individual users to down­
load over the network.
For Lakhavani, though the attack caused no 
permanent damage, it was an eye-opener for 
the University. “We really can’t make our net­
work foolproof,” she said. “We are going to get 
together and develop some action plan just to 
see what we can learn from this... to make 
things better for the future.”

Both CMU women and men attended the second annual Mosaic conference, held last Saturday in the UC.
MOSAIC, from page 1
by including more progrms and more workshops 
than last year. Also, sesion topics ranged from 
how to avoid getting roped off by automobile 
mechanics to supporting exual assault survivors.
“The panel that talkecabout the relationships 
between the two gendersyvas very successful, we 
all liked it,” said junior sychology major Maria 
Muti. “I have to admit tiat there were positive 
parts of this conference aswell as negative parts,” 
she said. “However, we ae here to make things 
better. We will pay close .ttention to the evalua­
tion sheets and do our bet to make next Mosaic 
even more successful.”
In the closing address, Uhcci expressed the need 
for men to take part of wome ’s issues. She remarked 
that it would not be any gooi for people to come and 
learn valuable information t the conference if they 
were simply going to keep th6e information to them­
selves. She suggested many /ays for men to make a 
difference, saying that there vas more men could do 
then they thought. Some exanples she gave included 
spreading the information tfey received at the con­
ference to their friends and datives.
During the conference, Mihael Murphy, dean of 
Student Affairs, expressedhow pleased he was 
with the way the day was prigressing. “This year’s 
Mosaic is great. It’s very successful. People do 
learn a lot of very important issues, and they’re 
enjoying themselves!,” he sad.
2/19 PROHIBITED WEAPON, 2:21 
pm — A Community Advisor from 
Hamerschlag House entered the Cam­
pus Police office to deliver a confiscated 
blow dart gun and six darts. The CA said 
that the owner of the dart gun, while 
shooting darts into the hallway bulletin 
board, had been seen by his RA. The RA 
told him to make the gun disappear.
Later, the RA saw the actor with the 
dart gun again, so he confiscated it. The 
CA told the actor that he could pick up 
the dart gun at the Campus Police office.
2/21 ASSIST OUTSIDE AGENCY,
10:12 am — FBI agents delivered a sub­
poena to the Campus Police office. The 
Chief accepted the subpoena and for­
warded it to the Legal Affairs office.
2/21 MARIJUANA POSSESSION,
10:20 pm — Two officers went to 
Morewood E-Tower, in response to a re­
port of the smell of marijuana. When they 
got to the room, a female was standing in 
the doorway. The female then entered 
the room and shut the door in the officers’ 
faces. The officers did not smell mari­
juana at the door. Nevertheless, they 
knocked on the door. The female who 
answered it said that the room was hers.
The officers asked her if she would let 
them in so that they could talk to her and 
her friends. She complied and the offic­
ers explained the reason for their pres­
ence. When they asked if the group had 
been smoking marijuana, one female 
, stated yes. But when the officers asked
* if there was any more marijuana present 
in the room, they answered no.
The officers explained to the group 
that they would be better off if they 
cooperated. But again they stated that 
there was no more marijuana in the 
room. The officers then began to search 
the room. First, they found an open 
bottle of rum under a desk, and then 
they found a bowl with residue and a 
Ziploc storage bag with what appeared 
to be marijuana inside of it.
All members of the group were issued 
internal citations for possession.
2/25 MEDICAL, 7:20 am - A High­
lander Cafe employee was attempting to 
set a beverage counter door on a counter 
frame when she accidentally dropped the 
door. It fell onto her right foot, directly 
across her toes. The responding officer 
transported her to Shadyside Hospital.
3/2 DISORDERLY CONDUCT, 3:38 
am — A security guard radioed Campus 
Police to inform them that he had seen a 
male jumping on some vehicles parked 
along Margaret Morrison Street. The 
guard then saw the actor get into a car 
with three others.
The responding officer removed the 
driver from the car. He asked the driver 
who was jumping on vehicles, but the 
driver said that he did not know. The 
officer asked the driver if he had been 
drinking and he said yes. The officer 
identified the driver via his CMU ID and 
told the driver that if his vehicle moved 
from its spot that night, he would be 
issued a DUI and would be going to jail. 
The driver then said that he would walk 
back to his fraternity house.
The security guard, in the meantime, 
had identified one of the rear passengers 
as the male who had been jumping on 
the cars. He, too, was removed from the 
vehicle, but he was then taken to the 
officer’s car and placed in the back seat. 
The officer informed the actor that he 
was issuing him a non-traffic citation for 
disorderly conduct. It was at this point 
that the actor confessed to both drinking 
and to jumping on the cars.
The owners of the damaged cars were 
contacted by the police and given the 
actor’s name.
3/2 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 5:11 am
— A CPS foreman noticed that someone 
had thrown two rolls of flaming toilet 
paper from the mall area between Wean 
and Porter Halls and into the parking 
area. The responding officer put out the 
burning toilet paper by dousing it with a 
bucket of water. A check of the mall area 
revealed no actors.
3/3 MEDICAL, 4:05 am - A CMU 
student called Campus Police to report 
that he had cut himself with an X-acto 
knife. The student said that while doing 
a class project, he placed the knife on the 
floor. When he moved his foot, he cut his 
left big toe. The victim was not wearing 
shoes or socks at the time of the accident. 
He was transported to University of Pitts­
burgh Medical Center for treatment.
3/3 RETAIL THEFT, 1:42 pm - An 
Entropy East employee called Campus 
Police saying that a co-worker was es­
corting a shoplifter back to the store.
The actor had fled from the scene but 
was stopped by the other employee on 
the walkway near the intramural fields. 
She asked him to come back to the store 
with her and return the goods that he 
had taken. He said that he was hungry. 
The employee stated that she had seen 
the actor place two cans of Campbell’s 
soup in his coat. When the officer checked 
the actor’s bag, he also found three cans 
of Chef Boyardee.
The officer issued the actor an inter­
nal citation for retail theft. The actor 
told the officer that he had not eaten 
since the day before and that he was out 
of money. The officer suggested that he 
go to Student Affairs and speak with the 
dean. All five stolen items were taken 
from the actor and turned over to the 
Entropy East employees.
3/4 MEDICAL, 6:20 am — Two offic­
ers reported to a Margaret Morrison 
apartment for a medical emergency. 
When the officers arrived, city medics 
were treating the victim because he had 
had a seizure. The officers found the 
victim unconscious but breathing. Ac­
cording to his roommate, he was awak­
ened by the sound of the victim having 
the seizure. The city medics transported 
him to the hospital.
3/6 ASSIST OUTSIDE AGENCY,
12:45 am — The University of Pitts­
burgh Police radioed Campus Police via 
city radio. They told the CMU Police to 
send one of their units to South Bouquet 
Street behind the Law School.
Upon arrival, the officers learned that

the undenge transportation of alcoholic 
beveragei. The actors had been caught

Carnegie Mellon University9 March 1998
Administration must 
consider student input
Last week, the University Aca­
demic Calendar Committee de­
cided to move next year’s spring 
break from the final week in 
March to the week following mid­
semester. While students were 
encouraged to give their opinions 
on the calendar change, the ad­
ministration disregarded the 
strong opposition it received. This 
recent dismissal of student opin­
ion is unacceptable and adds sup­
port to the argument that admin­
istrators only seek student input 
as a formality.
The Committee’s goal was to 
create a single calendar for all of 
CMU since GSIA and the Heinz 
School had different calendars 
from the rest of the University. 
The graduate schools preferred 
that spring break be changed to 
coincide with mid-semester and 
provide them with a week off be­
tween their third and fourth mini­
courses instead of interrupting 
their fourth mini-course.
When the Calendar Committee 
first proposed the change, they 
contacted Student Senate. Sena­
tors conferred with their constitu­
ents and found that student opin­
ion was strongly against the 
changes. Senate then passed a 
resolution stating that students 
felt there was little reason to move 
spring break because it was most 
beneficial during the last week of 
March. Students cited that the 
break provides a stress release 
before the end of the semester. 
Senate presented this to the ad­
ministration, but the Committee
went ahead with plans to move 
the vacation.
Students have made it clear that 
they want to provide input when 
the University’s future is con­
cerned, and the administration 
has stepped up its efforts to gather 
student opinion in recent years. 
The Presidential Student Advi­
sory Committee and this year’s 
réintroduction of the Vice-Presi- 
dential Student Advisory Com­
mittee are examples of this. But 
like last week’s spring break deci­
sion, students on these commit­
tees have complained that their 
input is often ignored or rejected 
without any given reason.
Now the Calendar Committee 
has a new proposed change that 
will affect the fall semester. It will 
add one week of class to the semes­
ter, causing the last day of final 
exams to fall on December 22. The 
administration will most likely ask 
students for feedback on this sub­
ject during the Town Meeting to 
be held this Wednesday. The ad­
ministration needs to seriously 
consider student opinions ex­
pressed there, since the calendar 
changes affect us the most.
When the administration de­
cides to go against the maj ority of 
student opinion, it needs to ex­
plain its reasoning so it is clear 
that student input was seriously 
considered. CMU students have a 
reputation for being apathetic 
when it comes to University deci­
sions. The administration only 
helps to promote that attitude 
when it ignores student opinions.
Blitz Booth adds 
diversity to Midway
In an effort to include more 
people in the Midway section of 
Carnival, the booth committee has 
instituted Blitz Booth — a non­
competitive category for those or­
ganizations with fewer members, 
less building experience and 
smaller budgets. This category 
will not only help those organiza­
tions that have had trouble find­
ing the resources to take part in 
Midway but it will also assist in­
dividuals who have an interest in 
building booth but no organiza­
tional affiliation. The Carnival 
Committee should be applauded 
for providing this option for those 
students who want to participate 
in Midway.
The rules for Blitz Booth are the 
same as those for regular competi­
tion but geared toward smaller or­
ganizations. The Booth committee 
has made the lot sizes smaller for 
this category so that organizations 
don’t have to spend as much time or 
money erecting elaborate struc­
tures. This is especially beneficial 
for those students who decide late 
in the year that they want to par­
ticipate in Booth and don’t know 
how to go about building or getting 
support to construct a booth. 
Through the Carnival Committee’s 
funding, Blitz Booth also offers a 
$100 subsidy for groups of students 
who need financial help.
In the past, the Midway has 
been dominated by fraternities, 
sororities, and other large organi­
zations such as ASA and SDC. 
While these organizations turn
James Mojonnier/Tartan Art Co-Editor
Letters to the Editor
Student critiques 
basis of column
out quality booths, some students 
don’t want the hassle of joining a 
club just to participate in Carni­
val activities. Also, Blitz Booth 
provides an opportunity for 
groups of students to band to­
gether and have fun building a 
booth. Whole dorm floors or a 
group of friends can work together 
to experience a tradition that has 
previously been unattainable 
unless they joined a booth- 
building organization.
While Booth is a competition for 
most, Blitz Booth participants will 
not have to worry about building 
the biggest, most-complex booth. 
Because it is a non-competitive 
category, organizers hope that 
those who follow the Blitz Booth 
rules can focus more on building 
strength and camaraderie within 
thier groups. Having a booth on 
the Midway will also allow smaller 
groups to publicize themselves in 
a high-profile campus arena.
With more people involved in 
the creation of booths, the Midway 
will take on more of a community 
atmosphere. New people bring a 
different perspective on the booth 
process and infuse their unique 
ideas into the collective Carnival 
spirit. This energy will inevitably

I just read Abhay 
Letter to Agrawal’s article on. — ... homosexuality, happi-fcullOr ness, and the Jurassic 
era [“Columnist calls for acceptance of 
gays,” 2/23]. I agree that the question of 
happiness is the wrong one to ask, and 
not only that but it is an illegitimate one 
as well. Making happy kids is a soft, 
affluent 20th century, Western misno­
mer that parents never used to have the 
luxury to think about... or maybe they 
just knew better. Instillingharder things 
like virtue, sobriety, responsibility, in­
tegrity, faith; these were the child-rear­
ing goals of those who went before us. 
That’s assuming they could just keep 
their kids alive first. Happiness was 
always a by-product of having the right 
character, not the higher aim in life.
Where I disagree is in Agrawal’s quick 
capitulation to the politically correct and 
narrow view that homosexuality is a 
feature every bit as genetically bestowed 
as one’s nose. That little assumption is 
one of the most hotly contested ideas 
today, and in my humble estimation, 
those against it have much more ammu­
nition than those supporting it. I under­
stand that your age group has probably 
never heard of the opposing side with 
any type of legitimacy, nor has most of 
America, for that matter. The liberal 
press, MTV, goVemment-run schools, 
and places like CMU will never go there 
with any amount of energy.
This notion of “sexual orientation” has 
only had significant support in this coun­
try for 20 years or less. Practically no 
civilization since the beginning of time 
has ever thought homosexuality was 
anything but a choice. Sexuality and 
marriage were almost always rooted in 
an understanding of opposite sexes unit­
ing for the creation of children and the 
preservation of a society. Current re­
search has not in any fundamental way 
unseated this view. Levels of hormones 
here and body types there is a weak 
and vapid voice against physiology 
and history.
It’s not about happiness or “equality.” 
We are sexual beings, yes, but that we 
are oriented in any sexual way other 
than for the procreation of children is 
not at all established. I know it warms 
our hearts to hear the media and Holly­
wood tell us so, but science and family 
structures argue other ideas than the 
popular “I was born that way.” These 
other answers need to be voiced in pa­
pers like The Tartan if we are to have 
any knowledge base with which to make 
our decisions other than the “party line” 
we hear ad naseum already.
It is up to people like you to disprove 
the dinosaurs like me in the realm of 
ideas, science, research, or philosophy 
and not in feelings about fairness or 
“equality.” Please don’t begin with the 
assumption that the scientific verdicts 
are already in and they side with the 
homosexual community. This is tenu­
ous at best, and neglects the many other 
intelligent propositions out there.

These words are used to illustrate how

theme of the commentary, but believe1 
that using the term “CMU fraternity” 
promotes negative stereotypes of the fra-;

the content of the commentary.
Simply saying “at a party on the CMU

instead of “a CMU fraternity” would 
have gotten the point across and would 
not have portrayed in a negative light 
persons only distantly affiliated with

then she could have simply named the

Portrayal of fraternities in general as.

Another week dawns rainy 
and cold at CMU, and as you 
trudge off wearily to class, 
your friends and relatives at 
other colleges are sleeping in 
and enjoying their spring 
breaks. At least, you think, 
you can look forward to hav­
ing spring break later in — 
the semester, when you 
really need it and when 
the weather might actu­
ally be warm.
Think again. This time 
next year, you may be look- ¦ 
ing forward to a work-inten­
sive, sleepless end of the se­
mester, broken by only one 
day to rest and study for fi­
nals, and a cold, wet winter 
break, thanks to a recent pro­
posal to move spring break to 
the ninth week of the spring 
semester in 1999.
As it stands now, not all the 
colleges in this University are 
using the exact same sched­
ule; the Graduate School of 
Iindustrial Administration 
and the Heinz school have 
different academic calendars. 
Several years ago, adminis-
those schedules into one all- 
encompassing calendar.
The result is a proposal to 
move the spring break to the 
ninth week of the semester (the 
week right after where mid­
semester break is now) and 
put mid-semester break some­
where later in the semester, 
close to finals. (Another simi-
a proposal that not only in­
conveniences students but 
also adds serious stress to 
their lives.
The biggest problem with 
this proposal is obvious: CMU 
works its students to death.

those classes than students

lar proposal would add an ex­
tra day onto the fall mid-se- 
mester break and four days 
onto the end of fall classes, 
ending finals on December 22.)
Now certainly, it would be 
nice if the entire University 
ran on the same schedule, and 
it would probably make coordi­
nating some University-wide 
things easier. In addition, as 
was cited as the main reason 
for the proposal, spring vaca­
tion in that particular week 
puts a nice clean break 
between the third and fourth 
mini-courses.
at most other universities. A 
spring break near the end of 
the semester, when the work 
gets to be more and harder 
and when finals start loom­
ing on the horizon, is a much- 
needed time for students to 
stop working, relieve stress, 
work on personal projects, 
and stock up on sleep for the 
ordeal ahead. One day of va­
cation near the end of the 
semester can’t serve these 
purposes as well as five. An 
early spring break would just 
not be as needed. The pro­
posed move would just add
more strain to an already- 
straining workload, and, 
needless to say, CMU stu­
dents hardly need more stress 
in their lives.
Equally important is a less 
obvious point: Spring break is 
for students. According to 
Bryon Krug, Student Body 
President, the committee that 
made these recommendations 
was comprised of fewer than 
20 percent students, and the 
protests of the students who 
were on the committee 
were overrun by sheer num­
bers. Considering that the 
students have by far the 
largest stake in this 
I issue, I can hardly call that 
fair representation.
Students are the reason why 
this place, a school, exists in 
the first place (and we fund it 
in large part with our fat tu­
itions); the break was created 
to give us a vacation from 
classes. We’re certainly the 
best ones to know when we 
need our break. Any compel­
ling restrictions aside, we 
should be able to choose when 
it is. (If anything, we should 
move spring break farther into 
spring, when we could actu­
ally enjoy our time outside.)

Euthanasia issue raises ethical questions
People have right to choose death
Open Forum
by Abhay Agrawal
Euthanasia, literally meaning “good 
death,” is the act of ending the life of a 
person who is suffering intolerable pain 
from a terminal illness or a serious physi­
cal handicap. In today’s world, euthanasia 
assumes a vast significance. Recently, a 
paralyzed university student, Roosevelt 
Dawson, won the right to leave a hospital, 
consulted with Dr. Jack Kevorkian, and 
committed suicide just hours later with 
his help.
Euthanasia should be made legal for the 
simple reason that some people suffer un­
bearable pain from a terminal illness which 
will eventually lead to death. Euthanasia 
will release such a person from unbear­
able agony and let them die in a peaceful 
and painless way.
Roosevelt Dawson was paralyzed. Vari­
ous brain disorders cause the loss of the 
ability to walk, see, hear, and talk. Differ­
ent diseases can cause people to become 
vegetables. Some people, such as Dawson, 
after a certain point, would rather die 
than live such a handicapped life. It’s a 
person’s choice as to what he or she wants 
to do. People have the freedom to wear 
what they want, eat what they want, work 
wherever they deem fit, and in short, do 
what they want with their lives. There­
fore, each person should have the right to 
choose whether he or she wants to live or 
die, just as Dawson did.
Most polls indicate that a majority of 
Americans are in favor of euthanasia. The 
1996 Gallup Poll found that 75 percent of 
people voted that doctors should have the 
right to end a terminally ill person’s life if 
demanded by the patient. In a survey of 
2761 Oregon physicians, 73 percent said 
they would be willing to refer a patient 
who requested a prescription for a lethal 
dose of medicine to a willing provider or 
comply personally with the request if phy­
sician-assisted suicide were legal. Only 4 
percent were unwilling to do either one.
There are notions that terminally ill 
people should go into hospice programs. I 
fully support the work of such hospice 
programs. Yet even though hospices can 
control terminal pain to a large extent, 
people miss the point that quality of life is 
vital to some people. If one’s body is so 
weakened by illness that he or she be­
lieves life is not worth living, then it is a 
fiercely individual decision which should
not be thwarted. In many cases, when the 
pain is too intense in the last days, a 
hospice patient is drugged and made un­
conscious. Many people do not wish to 
live like that.
The age-old Hippocratic Oath might 
come into doctors’ minds when they think 
of euthanasia. Yet the oathitself is flawed. 
It asks the doctor to give no deadly medi­
cine to anyone if asked and at the same 
time commands the doctor to assist the 
sick. The flaw lies in the assumption that 
benefitting the sick and prescribing 
deadly medicine are different. In many 
cases, the best way to benefit a termi­
nally ill person is euthanasia. Someone 
who wants to die and thus end agony can 
only benefit from euthanasia. Perhaps 
Hippocrates would better understand this 
oath’s flaw if he had 
suffered the pain 
that a cancer pa­
tient suffers.
The legalization 
of euthanasia in Or­
egon is a positive 
step and indicates 
that we have moved 
on. The Death with 
Dignity Act, which 
legalizes doctor-as- 
sisted suicide, fi­
nally made it 
through last No­
vember when 60 
percent of the vot­
ers voted “no” on a 
measure to repeal 
this act. The legal­
ization of euthana­
sia has to be done 
with various re- IYIa
strictions, such as age, maturity, due 
time to consider various options, and so 
on. Such restrictions would eliminate mis­
use. We don’t want doctors and insurance 
companies to conveniently kill off people 
who want to live, but are likely to be 
monetary liabilities to them. Thus we 
need certain restrictions in these laws, so 
as to ascertain that it is indeed the pa­
tient who is demanding euthanasia.
Only with the initiative and courage of 
remarkable individuals like Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian can medicine really fulfill its 
intended purpose, namely relief from pain. 
Euthanasia is an essential part of medi­
cine. Unfortunately, it is a crime. The 
people want better deaths and less pain. 
Doctors are willing to grant us painless 
deaths. Oregon has spoken. It’s high time 
that the rest of America acted and said 
“yes” to the legalization of euthanasia.

Death on demand violates morality
Open Forum
by Jenny Garcia de Osuna
The philosopher J. Gay-Williams 
wrote in “The Wrongfulness of Eutha­
nasia” in 1979 that “Euthanasia is in­
herently wrong because it violates the 
nature and dignity of human beings. 
But even those who are not convinced by 
this must be persuaded that the poten­
tial personal and social dangers inher­
ent in euthanasia 
are sufficient to 
forbid our approv­
ing it either as a 
personal proac­
tive or as a public 
policy.” Gay-Will­
iams poses a 
strong message 
that sheds light on 
the emotional and 
controversial ar­
gument over eu­
thanasia.
The notion of as­
sisted suicide, or 
“mercy killings,” 
is one that encom­
passes very pow­
erful and compet­
ing values. Many 
see it as a right to 
Adato/Tartan Art Co-Editor decisional au­
tonomy — the right to choose to die — 
while those who truly value human life 
fight for its protection from the full force 
of the law.
It comes down to this in the end: 
Euthanasia is wrong both because of the 
moral implications of ending a life and 
because of the possibilities of abuse in 
allowing such a practice to be sanc­
tioned by law.
To begin with, is there a difference 
between killing someone and letting 
him or her die? There is a fine but 
crucial difference in medical ethics be­
tween what is known as active and pas­
sive euthanasia.
Passive euthanasia is withholding 
treatment and allowing the body to die 
naturally without the aid of outside 
medicine. Active euthanasia, however,' 
is taking direct action to bring about 
death in order to end suffering. It is 
using an outside measure, such as le­
thal drugs, to deliberately end the life of 
a patient who would otherwise survive.
Human life is the most precious gift, and 
to end it before nature deems it ready to 
end is playing God, or Mother Nature, or 
plain biology.
In the medical profession, doctors have 
the responsibility to kill the pain, not the 
person. And in today’s world, with the 
possibilities of mistaken diagnosis, new 
cures, and spontaneous remission increas­
ing, the notion of legalizing euthanasia 
and taking the chance of ending some­
thing as sensitive and precious as human 
life is ridiculous.
These proponents of euthanasia are seek­
ing to redefine what is now known as 
homicide and call it an acceptable medical 
practice. There exists a fundamental te­
net of the paractice of medicine which 
states that physicians should be healers, 
not agents of death.
On November 8, 1994, the state of Or­
egon became the first place in the world to 
legalize physician-assisted suicide on de­
mand. The implications of such a “Death 
with Dignity Act” are scary. To open up 
such a hole in the medical practice could 
end up leading to much more dangerous 
acts in the future.
Where does it stop? Shbuld clinically 
depressed patients have the right to lethal 
drugs as well? Mental illnesses such as 
schizophrenia and depression could merit 
just as much suffering as any physical 
crippling and, until a cure for schizophre­
nia and the like are found, is that not a 
haunting condition for life? Is it not equally 
an illness that would cause the patient 
suffering until his or her death?
Some of the most miraculous stories of 
human progress are those of people who 
stuck through suffering, hardship, and 
terminal illnesses, and pulled through, 
those who found the strength to carry 
on and, at the very least, to learn from 
their pain. It may be too easy for a 
suffering patient to want to give up if he 
or she knows that choice is available 
and accessible.
The implications worsen. If I am given 
the right to commit suicide, unaided or 
not, it would be unfair to convict any 
person who might help me. Think of what 
that loophole might mean in the world 
of homicide.
If the moral implications of euthanasia 
do not stir you, as Gay-Williams stated, 
then the inherent dangers in its societal 
abuse should be enough to turn you against 
its legalization.

Plus, is it worth it? Far too 
much attention is being paid 
here to the scheduling of mini­
courses. Besides Heinz and 
GSIA students, there aren’t 
many people even taking 
them. Those who do are usually 
taking things like swimming.
It seems to me that rearrang­
ing the entire spring semester 
schedule to give those two col­
leges an easier transition be­
tween mini-courses is sacrific-
ing the good of the majority for 
the convenience of thé minority. 
Graduate students are certainly 
mature enough and accustomed 
enough to school to be able to 
handle a big break during one of 
their semesters.
And one might ask if combin­
ing the calendars is really worth 
all this disruption. It’s an admi­
rable goal, but the strife this is 
creating, and the stress and 
strain it would certainly create, 
is not really worth getting the
two graduate-only colleges in 
step with the six mostly-under- 
graduate ones. There doesn’t 
seem to be much cross-registra­
tion between the two groups, or 
for that matter, much interac­
tion at all.
Before I even got here, I was 
assailed with stories about CMU 
students’ incredible apathy, and 
I’ve found that for the most part 
it’s true. But now is definitely 
not the time to be apathetic. As 
John Papinchak, head of the
University Academic Calendar 
Committee, said himself, none 
of these-decisions are final. And 
there’s plenty you can do in the 
meantime to stop them from 
becoming so. You, after all, are 
paying the school to serve you.
You can email your thoughts 
on the changes to. the Student 
Council or to the head of your 
college or major or to the Uni­
versity Academic Calendar 
Committee. Or you can complain 
to the head honchos of the Uni­
versity itself. Or you can show 
up at the “Town Meeting” being 
held at the Dowd Room in the 
University Center on Wednes­
day from 4:30-5:30 pm and voice 
your opinion.
Or you can start making plans 
for your 1999 spring break ski­
ing trip.

Tartan lacrosse club 
achieves first victory

Tartán Sports Co-Editor
In a contest that featured a defense- 
man scoring for the first time since sev­
enth grade and a mid-fielder net three 
playing attack, the Carnegie Mellon la­
crosse club recordedits first win of the 
season on Friday against outmatched 
Allegheny College. Led by sophomore 
Jared Scott’s four goals and one assis and 
strong defensive play by sophomore Kevin 
Almirall and others, the victory brings 
the team’s record to 1-1 on the season 
and 1-0 in their divison.
The Tartans set the tone early by 
scoring four times in the first quarter. 
Allegheny added one of its own and 
the score at the end of one was 4-1.
The second quarter opened with an 
Allegheny penalty and, despite being 
unable to penetrate deep into the 
offensive zone, the CMU offense pres­
sured Allegheny with a combination 
of tough play and good stick han­
dling. The hard work paid off when 
freshman Nick Craine scored one of 
his three goals as the penalty expired 
to bring the score to 5-1. After the

Goalies deserve more respect
by Jessica Strelitz
To be a goaltender. I’ve written about it 
before and for one greuling practice this 
past week, I even tried to live it. Trust me, 
kids, it’s not as easy as it looks — nowhere 
near. Painfully mental, terribly physical; 
the goaltender is the man that gets show­
ered with blame for the fluttering goal that 
translates to a close loss; often standing 
and watching the scorers in the limelight 
after a tough win. The job is thankless in all 
sports. But a goalie, as the last line of 
defense, has some great, some spectacular, 
and some really bad days. Heading into the 
last third of the season, let’s run around the 
NHL and see what’s up with that.
People can debate, and I will, that 
Dominik Hasek is the greatest goaltender 
playing today. He won gold in Nagano for 
the Czechs. He won the Hart (MVP) trophy 
last year and faces 30-plus shots a game. 
Don’t let his numbers fool you. Though he 
is ranked ninth in the NHL with a 2.27 
goals-against average, he has nine shut­
outs, a 93 percent save average, and 53 
starts. Hasek gets a harder workout be­
fore the end of the first period than league- 
leader Martin Brodeur (1.77 GAA) does 
in a week playing with the streaking New 
Jersey Devils.
Brodeur is great; Patrick Roy, the but­
terfly king, relaxes behind the solid and 
consistent Avs defense; and Eddie 
Belfour is adapting very well to Dallas 
(1.89 GAA). But Hasek is single- 
handedly responsible for keeping the 
Sabres in it to win it this year.
The NHL is headed for playoff time and 
trades continue to be made. Ron Hextall 
continued to struggle in post-season play 
in ’96-97, giving up at least one softy per 
game for the Flyers. But backup tender 
Garth Snow, despite going 8-4 in the 
playoffs with a 2.83 GAA, couldn’t bring 
the Stanley Cup back to Broadstreet ei­
ther. His best days as a goalie remain 
when he and Mike Dunham were 
backstopping the University of Maine to 
a still unmatched 42-1-2 season in 1993.
After giving up some recent, lousy goals, 
Snow was shipped to Vancouver for vet­
eran Sean Burke. According to reports 
from Philly, if Burke does well, he is 
expected to be re-signed and replace 
Hextall as starter.
The strange thing about this deal is 
that on the outside, it looks as though 
Bobby Clarke was looking for someone
more reliable for post-season play. But 
Burke, though an NHLer for 10 years, 
has actually played in fewer playoff games 
than Snow in his three-year tenure. Please 
remember though, thatBurke was a long­
time member of the defunct Whalers, 
who are now spinning as the Hurricanes 
in Carolina. In his years there, that whale 
was beached in Hartford come the end of 
spring. The Flyers look to his leadership
— shown by being named MVP of the 
Whalers for four straight seasons — and 
his versatility and hope that he will 
contribute a spark.
The fans are looking for more scoring, 
but the stonewall boys just aren’t giving 
it. Tom Barrasso is healthy, and the 
Penguins are flourishing, and though 
Chris Osgood let in four goals on five 
shots in his last start, he still holds a 2.13 
GAA for the Red Wings. Maybe when the 
season starts next year, with the new 
rules about straightjacket chest protec­
tors and only allowing the goalies to play 
weak-side, the goal counts will soar like 
an Iceland-Khazakstan game. Hockey 
will be reborn, at least in the minds of the 
owners, but not if the Dominator has 
anything to say about it.

Baseball wins depend on large payroll
In the Swing
by Vy Ty Mai
I will stop mourning David 
Justice’s defection to the Indi­
ans. I will not dwell on the de­
parture of Jeff Blauser and Mark 
Lemke. I will try to forget 
my bitterness towards the 
Twins, the Blue Jays, the Blue 
Jays again, the Phillies, the 
Marlins, and, most especially, 
the Cleveland Indians.
Every Atlanta Braves fan comes 
with a lot of baggage — I am 
certainly no different. It’s the re­
sult of too many years of too many 
clif-fhangers. But as a new sea­
son begins, the subject of fans’ 
mental instability pales in com­
parison to the eyebrow-raising 
payrolls of certain clubs.
The 1998 Atlanta Braves are 
nothing close to the 1991 Braves. 
A team once driven by the high of 
a miraculous season and the exu­
berant backing of fans is now a 
slave to the bank account as they 
obsessively chase the fleeting 
World Series win.
The 1991 Braves were com­
prised of homegrown farm tal­
ent attained from years and years 
of last place finishes and sea­
soned Braves veterans. For the 
Braves, 1991 was a year of 
miracles. After what seemed like 
a decade-long losing streak, the 
Braves finally began winning 
that summer, and once they 
started, they didn’t stop. The 
season , however, ended with a 
heartbreaking loss in a seven- 
game, World Series showdown 
with the Minnesota Twins.
And so began the upward spiral.
Despite the loss, the Atlanta 
fans were still in a baseball fer­
vor. Never before had Atlanta 
had a championship team, and 
winning the Series that year 
would have been the proverbial 
cherry on top. But we — the fans 
— didn’t care. Our team 
was finally shedding their unof­
ficial title of “Underdog of the 
League” and everyone was ex­
ultant. Plus, there was always 
next year. Oh, and next year. 
Okay, next year, again.
In the never-ending chase for 
the Series win (and to get out of 
the vicious cycle of coming oh- 
so-close), the Braves became like 
nearly every other team in the 
league — providing big bucks 
for the bigger bang. It’s well 
known that sports teams are, 
first and foremost, business ven­
tures. The richer a team, the 
higher the chances of winning 
through bought talent. And the 
higher chances of winning 
means more money flowing 
through stadium gates. There-
so, my favorite players are 
shipped to teams for which I hap­
pen to harbor major animosity!
Gone are the days of loyal 
players and even more loyal 
clubs. As each season passes, 
fans watch as the payrolls of 
certain clubs get bigger and 
bigger, and the smaller clubs, 
like the Pittsburgh Pirates, are 
forced to rely on talent and 
youth to beat the League. But 
it’s a futile gesture.
As for the Braves, 1998 will be 
just another year. Fans and in­
dustry experts alike basically 
know that the Braves will make 
it to the playoffs, so the excite-
fore, instead of maintaining a 
promising minor league system, 
the All-Star players are obtained 
through that mercenarial free 
agent option.
Lost in the shuffle of big money 
and highly talented players with 
bigger egos, are the loyal, not-as- 
well-known John Does. The Mark 
Lemkes. These are the players 
who’ve stuck with their respec­
tive teams throughout the years, 
despite the thick and the thin of 
consecutive baseball seasons. Yet, 
somehow, in the transition of one 
season to the next, they are forced 
to trade in their former uniforms 
for a different one. Blame it on 
glory-seeking club managers, 
blame it' on an ever-expanding 
payroll that, for some unknown 
reason, has no room for such a 
player, or just blame it on the 
owners. Everyone else does. And

ment and expectation doesn’t re­
ally start until the dog days of 
August. After all, this decade is 
proof enough that the Braves can 
win. But will they? The heroes of 
the yesteryears are gone. Where 
have you gone, Terry Pendleton? 
Sid Bream? Ron Gant? Deion — 
okay, scratch that.
Nevermind that John
Schuerholz traded David Justice, 
with Marquis Grissom, to the 
Cleveland Indians for the evil 
Kenny Lofton and several other 
minions in a deal that left me sick 
at heart. Nevermind that it was 
all last year. It’s still the Indians, 
the World Series nemesis of yes­
teryears, the incubator of the 
Albert Belle plague, the 
netherworld of washed-up talent. 
Yes, the eveiNentertaining Cleve­
land Indians.
Even though the Braves are 
still a highly prospective team 
for the Series, other teams are 
doling out $12.5 million a year 
in five-year contracts to the 
Pedro Martinezs. Hence, com­
petition is getting fiercer. The 
king of the October mountain- 
won’t be the strongest toma­
hawk or the brightest player — 
it’ll be the team with the big­
gest wallet.

Win lifts hopes for new season
LACROSSE, from page 10
goal, both teams’ exchanged of­
fensive opportunities and the 
CMU defense held strong, led 
by senior goalie Gabe Colwell- 
Lafleur who . had 11 saves in 
three quarters of work. The 
teams then traded goals to make 
the score 6-2 with 2:30 left in 
the half when Colwell-Lafleur 
drew a questionable unsports­
manlike conduct penalty and the 
Tartans were forced to put fresh­
man goalie Rich Torio in cold to 
finish the half. Allegheny capi­
talized with a goal, and the score 
at half-time was 6-3.
Back-and-forth play was the 
story of the first eight minutes 
of the second half. Each team 
was unable to capitalize on the 
other’s errors including an ill- 
conceived Allegheny line change 
that left the goalie and defense 
unprotected and a two-man 
CMU advantage. Senior Jay 
Miolla ended the scoring drought 
with one of his three goals on the 
night. Soon after that, Craine 
and Miolla added two more to 
the Tartan’s tally and the score 
became 9-3 — the largest lead 
that CMU would hold.
With the contest comfortably 
in hand, coach Gerry Costanzo 
rotated the entire team into the 
game. “We have a young team
and it is important that we get 
everyone experienced.”
Allegheny, however, used this 
to their advantage and began to 
gain momentum. They opened 
the fourth quarter on the power 
play and quickly scored to close 
the gap to 9-5. Less than 30 
seconds later, Allegheny scored 
again and forced CMU to call a 
time-out and regroup. The Tar­
tans came out of the break strong 
and answered the Allegheny on­
slaught with a goal of their own, 
bringing the score to 10-6. The 
teams would trade goals for the 
remainder of the game and the 
contest ended in a 12-8 Carnegie 
Mellon victory.
Costanzo was very happy with 
the teams’ performance. He cited 
the fact that the team is averag­
ing over eight goals per game as 
opposed to last year’s output of 
less than four per game as one of 
the largest factors in the early 
victory. In addition, the institu­
tion of a 2-2-2 offense which uses 
an attacker’s size and stickhand- 
ling to penetrate the defense and 
get inside opportunities iskey to 
the added scoring punch. Finally, 
Costanzo noted that the size of the 
team and the influx of strong fresh­
man and sophomore talent are 
pivotal to the team’s present and 
future success.

free-throws. They rounded out 
the four-minute scoring streak 
with a pair of layups, making 
the score 52-51 — transform­
ing the comfortable Tartan lead 
into a one-point game.
With the clock hovering right 
above the two-minute mark, 
Emory sent Tartan sophomore 
forward Kristy Thomas to the 
free-throw line where she sank 
two shots to widen the pre­
cious CMU lead to 54-51. As 
the clock counted off the re­
maining seconds of game time, 
Emory was again forced to foul 
the CMU squad, and Petruzzi 
hit two more free throws with 
14 seconds left. Not to be 
counted out, the Eagles hit a 
three-pointer to make the game 
56-55 with two seconds left on 
the clock. Emory fouled 
Petruzzi to stop the clock, but
Petruzzi hit another two free 
throws giving CMU a hard-fought 
58-55 win.
The Tartans ended the game with 
three players in double digits in 
scoring: Majemik and Harris with 
11 points each, and senior guard 
Marcelle Steele with 10 points. 
Sophomore forward Kristy Thomas 
led the team in rebounds.
“It was nice to win a game that 
was close, because we’ve had prob­
lems with that,” said Seidl. The 
Tartans ended their season 9-15 
overall, and 3-11 in the UAA. That 
record is one win shy of the team 
goal of 10 wins for the season.
“This is one of the years that, 
despite the record, I wish the season 
would never end,” said Seidl. “I could 
coach this team forever. They are 
the one of the most intense, fun 
groups I’ve ever worked with.... They 
have a chemistry and desire and 
upbeat attitude about the game.”

Hockey team reaches unexpected heights
HOCKEY, from page 14
stonewalled second period IUP 
onslaught with ten saves.
The third period presented new 
problems. Berkowitz, working ex­
tra hard to cover any open space 
left by Duncan — who was slowed 
by his injury — was almost burnt 
out. The third line was minus 
their leader, Brandon Paluzzi, 
who was sitting out the game 
with a shoulder injury. Frustra­
tion mounted when IUP caught 
the CMU defense going too deep 
into the offensive zone and capi­
talized on the situation by scor­
ing two quick goals. Five minutes 
later, IUP scored again and the 
Tartans were in the hole, 4-1.
After that, Brangwynne went to 
the box for ten minutes and Duncan 
left the ice with a nasty hit to the leg. 
The wind was taken out of CMU’s 
sails. Voulgaris’s goal towards the 
end, a ripper on a feed from 
Leonhardt, sparked some excite­
ment from the bench but little pro­
duction. The game ended, 4-2 IUP.
‘This team was a team that all 
the other teams would come to watch 
but not give them any credit 
for their efforts. Then (CMU) would 
overachieve. I am so proud of all 
of their effort,” said head coach 
Fred Maddalena
“Anytime that you have 13 new 
players, it takes a while to become a 
team. I think that we did that in the
last couple of weeks, and i’m really look- 
ingforward to next season,” said Grzywacz, 
who lead the team in scoring with 14 goals 
on the year.
Grzywacz is part of a strong sophomore 
class; including goaltender Min, Ryo Ota 
and rookie defenseman Brangwynne, that 
will lead the team next year. Steve 
Leonhardt will join them as a force, as he 
moves into his senior year. Duncan will 
return, and Voulgaris and Fitzgerald also 
continue to play next season as fifth-year 
architecture majors.
With the solid addition of freshman 
Aaron Hula and continuing good play 
from junior Alex Chin, the defense should 
be able to weather the storm of losing 
Mitzel. But the Tartans will be looking for 
consistent improvement from freshmen
Rick Ebert who got a lot of ice time — as 
well as forwards Scott Scheider, Matt 
Davidson and Zeke Spera. The team will 
also retain new defensemen, freshmen 
DougFaust and Harry Tsang. CMU gradu­
ates three seniors and loses Doreen 
Mulryan, who was one of the only female 
players in the WPCHA and is transferring 
next year.
The moral of this season may be don’t 
count CMU hockey out, ever. Even with 
the loss of powerhouse players who scored 
30 goals in 10 games and defensemen who 
busted open lanes so big that freight trains 
could run through last year, CMU held on 
like it wasn’t anything but chicken wing. 
This team has heart, bigger than any 
other around’. And the underdogs will 
rise again.

Men’s team fails to 
win in season finale
MEN, from page 14
After the time-out Emory 
scored from the field and twice 
from the foul line to re-establish 
a lead at 10-12. For much of the 
remainder of the first half 
Carnegie Mellon was forced to 
play catch up. Points from co­
captains senior froward Andy 
Sofish and Colin Shaunnessey 
held the Emory lead to only a few 
points. Sofish put the Tartans 
back on top 18-17 and Widmeyer 
gave CMU a 21-19 when he hit a 
three point shot with six minutes 
left in the half.
CMU pushed their lead to four 
points and was able to hold off an 
aggressive full court press from 
Emory until the last two min­
utes. After that turnovers plagued 
the team and the offense sput­
tered, allowing Emory to go into 
half-time tied at 32-32.

For the Tartans to have a • 
chance in the second half they 
would have to do a better job 
breaking the Emory press and 
not turn the ball over as much as 
they did in the final minutes of 
the first half.
Praesel opened the half with a 
three point shot for Carnegie 
Mellon. For the next four minutes 
CMU was only able to score one 
more point and gave up five fouls. 
By the time Praesel scored again 
to bring the Tartans to 39 points 
Emory had pushed past CMU and 
had 43 points of their own.
CMU was whistled for their 
seventh team fould of the half 
with more than 15 minutes left. 
The high number of calls, on both 
teams, but particularly CMU, 
slowed the game down to a crawl.
Carnegie Mellon closed 
Emory’s lead to two points in the 
first half on the back of Praesel, 
but with 12 minutes left Emory 
started to pull away. In the end 
Emory finished the game with a

Unusual suspect gets top 
spot in NCAA tournament
art by Matt Blum/Tartan Art Staff
The Alley Oop
_____by Chris Cannon
Believe me, I was as surprised 
as you must be when I found out 
that the Princeton Tigers are go­
ing to win the big dance this year. 
That’s, right, those Ivy League 
boys. I haven’t gotten my tourna­
ments mixed up either, we’re not 
talking lacrosse or crew here. 
We’re -talking - about the- men’s 
basketball NCAA tournament. 
March Madness. My magic crys­
tal ball tells me the Tigers will 
come out on top, so now I’m trying 
to figure out why.
It won’t be because the Tigers are 
well-rested. History has shown that 
well-rested teams actually perform 
worse in the tournament. The Pac 
Ten, and until this season, the Big 
Ten have not conducted conference 
tournaments, but have been rou­
tinely shelled in the ’90s. Besides 
the Fab Five teams from Michigan 
and defending champion Arizona, 
few teams from either conference 
have made it out ofthé second round
in the past decade. So it doesn’t 
really matter that Princeton has 
played six fewer games than North 
Carolina (30-3), the tournament 
favorite and the only team to beat 
them this season.
There will be no surprise factor 
to carry the team to victory. 
Princeton is seeded number five 
(which means the selection com­
mittee thinks there are at least 
16 teams better than the eighth 
ranked Tigers, but that’s another 
column) in the east and have a 
26-1 record. How are you going 
to be surprised by a highly ranked 
team with the best win percent­
age in the nation? It’s actually 
much more likely for the Tigers 
to be upset in the first round by 
UNLV, who beat two ranked 
teams to, win the WAC title, than 
it is for Princeton to enact re­
venge against UNC.
The Tigers won’t win because 
the opponents are unprepared for 
Princeton’s methodical offense. 
UCLA was the last team to take 
the Tigers lightly (instead of by the 
tail). Two years ago, the then-de­
fending champs were outsted in 
the first round off a game-winning 
back-door cut. Against Georgetown 
in the 1992 tournament, during 
Alonzo Mourning’s senior year, 
Princeton dominated the pace of 
the game before losing 51-50, also
in the opening round. Every team 
the Tigers may face will be ready 
for their back-door cuts, great 3- 
point shooting, and slow-down of­
fense that has no set plays.
Hmm, there must be some rea­
sons to justify my crystal ball. 
Princeton does have some things 
in their favor. They have the 
nation’s longest winning streak 
with 19 consecutive victories. The 
last team to win the tournament 
with a star center and a no-name 
supporting cast was Kansas with 
6’10” big man Danny Manning in 
1988. It’s probably not signifcant 
either that Princeton’s star is 
6’10” center Steve Woodrich, the 
biggest player the team has had 
in years. It also doesn’t matter 
that, like Manning, he distrib­
utes the ball well, is their defen­
sive key, and doesn’t lead the 
team in rebounds. Last year’s 
champion, Arizona 26-3, is the 
only other team to win their con­
ference without a tournament. 
Coincidence? Um, actually, yeah.
Upset Specials: Temple, Xavier 
(both in second round), Florida 
State, and Fairleigh Dickinson
Final Four: Duke, Cincinnati, 
Kansas, and (of course) Princeton.

better shooting from the field 
allowed Chem-E to pull closer,

a one point deficit.
The second half was close

Trash traded points and both

They successfully ran down the

The first overtime looked like it

Chem-E with no choice but to foul 
to get the ball back. It didn’t work, 
and White Trash hit its free throws

Volume 92, Issue 19The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania9 March 1998
By BRIAN SMITH 
& NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Sports Co-Editors
The focus of Carnegie Mellon 
intramurals was on basketball last 
Wednesday and Thursday nights as 
the Road to Skibo ended with the 50th 
annual Intramural Night. The event 
featured six men’s and two women’s 
teams fighting for championships in 
four different divisions.
The Women Only division kicked off 
the affair on Wednesday night in the 
University Center gymnasium as 
front-runners Rainin’ Threes squared 
off against the 5-1 Tartan Hoopers. 
The Rainin’ Threes lived up to their 
name and preserved their undefeated 
record with a 27-17 route. Junior 
Lindsay Smith led the Threes with 18 
points and was named the game’s Most 
Valuable Player.
On Thursday, the action moved over 
to Skibo Gym and the men’s divisions. 
The Minors opened the festivities with 
Beta Buck Naked taking on the Metros, 
comprised of members of the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s varsity soccer team. The 
varsity athletes were not able to give 
Beta much of a contest in the first half as 
Beta jumped out to a 20-11 lead by 
halftime. The third quarter opened with 
sloppy passing and ball-handling on both
sides, but neither team was able to capi­
talize on the other’s mistakes until Beta 
hit a three-pointer. The Metros quickly 
broke out of their scoring slump by coun­
tering with a three of their own. The

teams then exchanged two-pointers, 
highlighted with a strong drive to the 
basket and score by Beta’s first-year 
student Jason Stieg. The Metros retali­
ated with five points and Beta put up 
another six, including 
a three-pointer by first- 
year student Brian 
Rosinski to make the 
score going into the 
fourth quarter 35-25 
in favor of Beta.
The threes contin­
ued to fall in the last 
period as the teams ex­
changed tallies for the 
first four minutes. 
Beta tightened up on 
defense, improving 
ball handling and not 
allowing open shots to 
the Metros in the sec­
ond part of the quar­
ter, all but shutting 
down their offensive 
punch. When all was 
said and done, Beta 
Buck Naked avenged 
an earlier loss to the 
Metros and came out 
on top 45-35.
The intermediate 
championship was 
played between Theta
Xi Liquid and Navy ROTC. Theta Xi 
entered the game undefeated at 6-0 
against Navy’s record of 5-3.
The game started with Theta Xi turn­
ing the ball over and Navy jumping out 
to a quick lead. Theta Xi was able to 
counter, and gained the lead briefly in 
the first quarter. With a minute left, the 
score was tied at 10-10 and it looked like

the game was going to go into the second 
quarter with that count, but Navy hit a 
three point shot with five seconds left to 
give them a 13-10 lead.
Theta Xi came out of the break ready 
to go and outscored Navy 8-2 in the 
opening minutes cf the quarter. Navy 
showed its resilience and put together a 
run at the end of the half to once again 
go into the break with a lead. This time
it was only a one-point lead, and the 
second half proved that it was more 
tenuous than the lead that they had 
enjoyed before.
Theta Xi built a lead that was at times 
as large as five points. For most of the 
rest of the game, they managed to keep 
the buffer between themselves and Navy. 
However, in the last minutes of play 
Navy closed the 
gap to one point. 
They tried to 
foul Theta Xi 
and keep the 
clock’ from run­
ning out, but it 
didn’t work. 
Theta Xi fin­

night was to de­

Marcelle Steele shields the ball from an Emory defender.
Emory early and then held off a 
too-little, too-late comeback at­
tempt by the Eagles late in the 
game to claim a 58-55 victory. 
“That was the best way possible 
to end the season,” said head 
coach Geri Seidl.
The Tartans took command in 
the first half, dictating the tempo of 
the game. Early on, CMLJ went on 
a six-minute run which character­
ized the pace of the first half. With 
the scoreboard showing an 8-8 tie, 
sophomore forward Samantha 
Majernik hit a three-pointer to put 
the Tartans up 11-8. Seconds later, 
freshman guard Lauren Petruzzi 
let loose with a three-pointer of her 
own which widened the lead to 14- 
8. Then sophomore guard/forward 
Hill ary Harris went on a two-minute 
rampage, burying two layups, a 
three-pointer, and a free throw. 
Emory struggled to retake control, 
putting together a layup and a free 
throw to bring the score to 22-11. 
However, Harris hit another three- 
pointer, and Majernik drove 
through the Eagle defense for a 
layup to widen the lead to 27-11 
before Emory managed to get their 
act back together. During the Tar-
“I think it took Emory a while 
to figure out what hit them,” 
said Seidl. “We were in the 
driver’s seat.”
The Tartans were hot in the 
first half, shooting 12-26 overall, 
6-13 from the free-throw line, 
and a phenomenal 7-9 from three- 
point land.
“[Emory] is not a team that will 
lay down and die,” Seidl had told 
her team. The majority of the 
second half progressed in much 
the same manner as the first — 
Emory stepped up their offensive 
performance but were unable to 
stop the Tartan offense. The two 
teams traded shots, but the Tar­
tans maintained a comfortable 
14-point lead.
“I The Emory game] was the best 
defensive post game we’ve played 
all year,” said Seidl.
However, with just under 
seven minutes remaining in the 
game, the Eagles launched a 
drive of their own. Emory made 
a free throw to bring the score to 
52-37. They then hit two three- 
pointers in a row and stepped to

The Carnegie Mellon ice 
hockey team closed out their 
season in late February, bow­
ing out in the semi-finals of the 
Western Pennsylvania Colle­
giate Hockey Association 
(WPCHA) playoffs - CMU’s 
eighth consecutive appearance. 
The games brought to an end a 
season of triumphs, tribulation, 
and intense rebuilding.
The first test was on Febru­
ary 21 — the final regular-sea- 
son game against third-place 
Allegheny College. Allegheny 
dominated the Tartans, scor­
ing four unanswered goals in 
the first two periods — all from 
the same player — and killing 
CMU physically by checking 
high into the body and setting 
them back on their heels for 
most of the game.
Carnegie Mellon started to 
rally with less than two min­
utes left in the second period 
when graduate student Adam 
Duncan scored on a sweet play. 
“[Senior Jonathan Berkowitz] 
took a slap shot from the oppo­
site side of the ice. I thought it 
might come off at steep angle, so 
I drifted to the left of the goalie. 
It came off as expected. I went 
down on one knee and shot the 
puck upper left,” said Duncan. 
Senior Scott Fitzgerald also as­
sisted on the play.
Allegheny opened the third 
period by increasing their lead 
to 5-1. Junior Steve Leonhardt 
and sophomore Przemyslaw 
Grzywacz both picked up the 
pace and started taking Allegh­
eny to the boards. Halfway 
through the final period, Duncan
caught a pass from sophomore 
Cliff Brangwynne in the defen­
sive zone; took advantage of the 
Allegheny goaltender sitting back 
in net, exposing the upper right 
corner; and scored from 20 feet 
out. Five minutes later, the same 
exact play went down again, ex­
cept this time the shooter was 
Fitzgerald and the feeder was se­
nior defenseman Paul Voulgaris.
“We could have beaten them. If 
we had played a full 60 minutes 
of hockey, we would have. They 
weren’t very impressive at all,” 
said Duncan about the Allegheny 
squad. The game 
ended in a 5-3 Al­
legheny win. Start­
ing CMU goaltender 
sophomore Gil Min 
had 22 saves.
Despite dropping a 
few games late in the 
season, CMUs win­
ning streak earlier in 
the semester and a 
resounding win over 
first-place Indiana 
University of 
Pennsylvania’s Divi­
sion II team set them 
firmly in fourth place 
in the end — the last 
qualifying spot for 
post-season play.
Seeded thus, CMU 
faced IUP again in the 
first round ofthe play­
offs on February 28.
CMU had nothing 
to lose. The Tartans 
were 2-6-1 in the 
fist half of the year 
and had lost over 90 percent of 
their scoring power from the last
playing together, the team had 
gotten itself into the playoffs.
CMU was the only team in the 
league to beat IUP that year, and 
had done it by being smart and 
taking the body first — which was 
exactly how this game started out. 
Play was dead even. IUP scored, 
and CMU answered 40 seconds 
later when Brangwynne got the 
puck to Grzywacz, who was streak­
ing hard down the left side. 
Grzywacz had just passed the IUP 
tender, and scooted the puck to­
wards the net when it went be­
hind the goalie and was kicked in.
wouldn’t be calling many penalties, 
just letting the teams play. IUPs 
defense was keyed, hitting every­
thing in sight. It wore CMU down.
“They were swarming,” said 
Duncan, who played despite an 
ankle injury and being smacked 
around the whole game. “It 
seemed like they had eight play­
ers on the ice to our five.” 
Voulgaris, Brangwynne, and 
Grzywacz tried to negate IUP’s 
speed and open up lanes to score, 
but CMU only managed four shots 
in the second.

On Saturday, February 28, the 
CMU women’s basketball team 
honored its departing seniors the 
best way they knew how — by 
upsetting a team ranked 15th in 
the nation. The Tartans attacked
tans’ drive, they managed to more 
than triple their own score while 
holding the Eagles to only three 
points. For the remainder of the 
half, the Eagles tried to close

shot-for-shot to end the half with a 
37-24 lead.
Men drop final home game
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
The last week ofthe men’s basketball season 
ended with mixed results, much like the rest of 
the season. The team began with a win, but fell 
short on their last game of the season. To cap 
off the week junior guard Tommy Praesel was 
awarded UAA Player of the Week.
On February 25, the Tartans avenged a loss 
from earlier in the year to Thiel College, beat­
ing them on their home court 90-74. On Satur­
day, February 28, the team returned home for 
the last game of the 97-98 season to face UAA 
opponent Emory University. The game was 
closer than the final score indicated, but in the 
closing minutes Emory pulled away and beat 
CMU for the second time this season.
The Thiel game represented a major im­
provement over the earlier contest between 
the two teams. On January 13, Thiel came to 
CMU and easily beat the Tartans 33-63. In
that game Carnegie Mellon looked em­
barrassingly outmatched, producing 
their worst offensive night of the sea­
son, and giving up nearly twice as many 
points as they scored including an ego- 
deflating ally-oop.
This time CMU came prepared for 
Thiel and stole a victory from them on 
their own court. Carnegie Mellon showed 
its own offensive punch, racking up 
nearly three times as many points as 
before. Praesel scored 24 points to lead 
CMU to their 10th win of the season.
Against Emory the Tartans opened up 
well. Teams traded points in the opening 
minutes and despite being down early, 
senior guard LaDale Widmeyer pushed a 
fast-paced offense to stay close. With 13:39 
inthefirst,halfjuniorforwardChrisButsco 
gave CMU its first lead of the game 10-8, 
forcing Emory to call a time-out.

Greeks
By LISA RUMP
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Hundreds of hours of work and prac­
tice went into the preparation for 
Greek Sing 1998. Preparation for this 
event began last semester for the ma­
jority of the houses, 
though for many, the 
last few weeks were 
crunch time.
“We’ve been work­
ing on [Greek Sing] 
for a month, but we 
got a lot done the last 
week,” said Ali 
Ardalan, a sophomore 
IM major and brother 
of Phi Kappa Theta.
Money raised by this year’s event 
benefited the Make-A-Wish Founda­
tion of Western Pennsylvania.
Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) took third 
place in the singles division with an 
enthusiastic version of Austin Pow­
ers. Featured in this act were the 
singing debut of Doctor Evil and Aus­
tin Powers stripping down to his PiKA
sing for
underwear. The act included classic 
skits from the movie, including 
Austin’s reunion with his Swedish 
penis enlarger after thirty years of 
being cryogenically frozen.
Second place in singles went to Al­
pha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) and their own
Avenue X, the story of Xavier Jackson, 
recording superstar, and how he got 
his start after having conflicting loyal­
ties to friends and their bands. Xavier 
manages to bring his friends from both 
sides of Avenue X together, winning a 
battle of the bands and making re­
cording history. AEPi gave an inspired 
performance that included the songs
charity
“Dancin’ in the Streets,” “Cooleyhigh- 
harmony,” “Walk This Way,” and “Fly.” 
Defending champion Phi Kappa 
Theta’s strong performance of Disney’s 
musical Newsies took first place in the 
singles category. Newsies is the story 
of orphans and runaways who peddle 
the newspapers of Jo­
seph Pulitzer and Will­
iam Randolph Hearst. 
The brothers of Phi Kap 
performed a well-cho­
reographed number, 
made possible only 
through a month of plan­
ning and rehearsals.
“We went into this with 
a lot of confusion, but 
when we started rehears­
als,” said Reid Patterson, a sophomore 
in chemical engineering and Phi Kap’s 
Greek Sing chair. “I saw all the support 
I had and knew we could do it.” 
During their production, Phi Kap 
allowed the newsies to throw their 
papers from moving pushcarts. The 
brothers of Phi Kappa Theta were very

Planning committee chair 
Christina Lopez opened last 
Saturday’s Mosaic conference by 
doing what she called “some­
thing cheesy.” During her open­
ing comments, she summoned 
two volunteers from the audi­
ence of about 50 to the front of 
McConomy Auditorium and 
placed bricks in each of their 
hands. The senior psychology 
major then continued with her 
speech, noting a few corrections 
to the agenda she had just dis­
tributed for the annual six-hour 
conference. After a few minutes, 
she asked, “So how are our brick 
holders doing? Are you wonder­
ing, What the heck is she do­
ing?’ ” The brick holders laughed 
a little uncomfortably.
The point, said Lopez, was 
that the pressures of life at 
CMU tend to weigh us down.
We carry bricks around with us 
every -day.
“What I would like you to do today is take 
all your bricks and leave them at the door. 
Put them down,” she told the volunteers. 
They obliged. “There we go. Down with the 
bricks.... This [conference] is our gift to you.”

tory Council. This year, 200 students, faculty, and 
staff registered for the event, an increase from 150

One change in the conference this year was its 
merger with Herstories, a biennial conference for 
graduate women. “We wanted to be more inclusive 
and make the conference bigger, stronger, and 
better,” said Lopez.
Barrie Simpson, a member of the CMU Board of

“Eat and see my life in 40 slides,” Simpson said 
to the crowd. She showed a series of photographs 
from her youth through her career as marketing 
director of various toy and publishing companies.
Simpson advised the women in the audience to 
endure what she said would be inevitable dis­
crimination in the workplace. “[When I started 
working,] I had a very male management at my 
company. You will all face this,” she said. “All I

If you look at the walls of the art 
gallery in the University Center this 
week, you will not find any art. Instead, 
the exhibit consists of white t-shirts lo­
cated in the center of the room and 
suspended by several clotheslines. The 
unique medium, bare walls, and notice­
able location are the devices that the 
coordinators of the Clothesline Project 
have used to increase awareness of vio­
lence against women.
The Student Life office put together 
the exhibit in coordination with Mosaic, 
last weekend’s annual conference on 
women’s issues. Participants in last year’s 
conference, both CMU students and Pitts­
burgh residents, made t-shirts which were 
displayed on the Cut last fall; in response 
to positive feedback, Student Life cre­
ated the current exhibit using only shirts 
made by CMU students.
“A lot of people have been really glad 
that we’ve had it on campus.... I think 
we’ve done a lot at CMU to increase 
awareness of sexual assault,” said Chris­
tina Lopez, a senior psychology major 
and organizer of the exhibit.
The general purpose of the project is 
to provide an outlet for women who 
want to bear witness to their personal 
experiences of violence and celebrate 
their transformation from victim to 
survivor in a powerful statement of 
solidarity, according to Lopez. “We

wanted to make people aware that even 
here [violence against women] is an 
issue,” she said. “[At CMU] there are a 
significant number of survivors and stu­
dents who know survivors.”
At the national level, the Clothesline 
Project is now over eight years old. It 
was started in Hyannis, Massachusetts, 
where a clothesline was hung across the 
town commons with 31 t-shirts designed 
by survivors of assault, rape, and incest.
“The whole idea comes from hanging 
clothes, which is considered women’s 
work,” said Lopez. “Women would share 
stories and talk while hanging clothes.” 
The t-shirts in the project quickly 
became a powerful medium, according 
to Lopez. Many more women came for­
ward and created t-shirts to add to the 
project. Now, there are an estimated
35,000 shirts in over 300 national and 
international projects.
The project is expanding at CMU as 
well. Attendees at this year’s Mosaic 
made more t-shirts, which have also 
been put on display.
Lopez hopes the project will become 
an annual tradition. “It’s cool to see [the 
project] get really big, but it’s also scary 
at the same time to see the number of t- 
shirts get so large,” she said. “It’s good 
for awareness, but it’s hard to ignore the 
increasing amount of shirts and what 
they stand for.”
She added that one of the key fea­
tures of the Clothesline Project is the 
simplicity of the medium. Survivors of

assault do not need to be an artist to 
make a t-shirt. They can use paint, 
magic markers, or elaborate embroi­
dery to create their shirt.
“I think it’s a really incredible expres­
sion of women’s experiences that really 
gets across how they feel,” said Rachel 
Whipple, an undeclared first-year stu­
dent in H&SS. “It’s sometimes better to 
express artistically what is often hard to 
express verbally.”
Other viewers, like Matt Messner, a 
research assistant at the Robotics Insti­
tute, were struck by the whole concept of 
the Clothesline Project and the women 
who participated in it. “I definitely like 
what it’s all about,” he said. “It’s the kind 
of thingthat people feel guilty and ashamed 
to talk about... but it’s great that they can 
use art to express themselves.”
The UC Art Gallery is located on the

desk and is open on weekdays from 1 to

“We meet with house chairs early in

said VanNewkirk. “[The] council has

The executive board gathered the opin­
ions of house chairs and selected the

Columnist breaks barriers between languages
Defining Ethnicity
by Michelle Han
Often language is what keeps 
us worlds apart. Have you ever 
tried communicating with some­
one whose language you do not 
speak? Maybe you know a few 
words. But maybe they’ll pull out 
a word that sounds as foreign to 
you as if someone had chopped up 
your language and tossed the syl­
lables up in the air. You stumble 
through pauses and silences. You 
grope — it’s much like trying to 
find a lightswitch in the dark — 
and hit a brief moment where you 
both connect on a certain word,
only to find that the light has 
gone out. You are left in the dark.
Growing up in my household, 
where two languages attempted 
to exist side by side, many 
battles were fought, and won or 
lost hinging on a particular 
string of words. How could I 
answer my parents when a fury 
of fast and foreign words would 
spur forth from their mouths in 
a tone that meant, “don’t dare 
respond, even if you could un­
derstand every word?” And how 
could two stunned parents, un­
informed about the jargon of 
two American teenagers grow­
ing up in their house, form a 
response, in any language, ag­
ile enough to match what was 
said? In world where neither 
language gained the complete 
upper hand, something was lost.
My mother thinks hard for a 
word she wants to use, then
gives up. We are in a conversa­
tion over the phone. I see her 
churning through words in her 
head, and none of them seem 
right. She seems happier in her 
thoughts, where the language
she grew up with is secure and 
complete — she does not need to 
force her thoughts into English, 
a language in which they will 
not all fit.
I often wonder what the exact 
meaning of the thought she is 
telling me might be. Is it enough
that she communicates in a loose 
choice of words? Is it the same if 
she tries to say something in 
English that should have been 
spoken in its fullness in Korean? 
When she writes a letter to me
— a rare occurrence, usually 
arriving with a package of things 
I’d asked her to send — she 
alternates between the two. 
“Michelle,” she starts. Then a 
sentence or two of Korean, whose 
characters appear sharp and 
swift in her handwriting, which
is usually curved and smooth. 
I’ve seen the notorious paper­
work that she’s had to fill out as 
a nurse; the words seem to 
sprawl across the page in her 
loopy, lazy-looking writing — so 
different from the angular, East­
ern alphabet used in her own 
language. She substitutes a few 
English words for things she 
thinks I won’t understand: 
hairdryer, prescription, vaca­
tion. After a few more utter­
ances that sometimes seem tra­
ditional and old, and a few ex­
hortations to eat properly, she 
ends with the usual oddity, “Stay 
healthy and warm clot hes.” 
But despite differences in ex­
pressions or particular words, 
or even the inability to commu­
nicate in whole sentences at all, 
strong ties still hold. I love the 
sound of the language in which 
my parents communicate; I love
to hear them banter back and 
forth in a sing-song, playful tone 
full of hidden meanings which 
they alone can understand. I 
love looking at its letters, al­
most pictures, on a Korean 
newspaper page, or on the di­
rections on a package of food; its 
characters are somewhat com­
forting in their foreign feel. Even 
sentences overheard in an el­
evator or crowded lunchroom, 
often spoken too fast for me to 
understand, are strangely com­
forting and real. I don’t know 
why. But I know what my 
mother means; maybe it is bet­
ter for me to fill in the blanks in 
my own mind.
Michelle Han is a senior cre­
ative writing major and a second- 
generation Korean-American. She 
explores her personal ethnic expe­
riences through her writing.

child, Mary.
“There I am, very 
pregnant. I was big as 
a house,” she said.
“And let me tell you something else, 
ladies: I worked the day I had my first 
child, and I Worked until the day before
I had my second.”
Reactions to the keynote address were 
mixed. “Some people really loved her, 
and some people really did not,” said
Lopez. “I honestly think it’s ----------------
an age thing.... She defi­
nitely appealed more to the 
older women in the group.”
“I got the impression 
that the speaker was re­
ally assertive and would 
potentially be a really 
good role model for men 
or women,” said Wynne 
Lee, a sophomore psy- 
chology major.
Students chose from 12 lectures and 
panel discussions, which focused on is­
sues such as physical and emotional 
health, academic and professional is­
sues, social issues, and personal issues. 
There were three sessions — one in the 
morning and two in the afternoon — 
composed of four lectures apiece.

tive operations for the Housing office, 
raised her hand. “I’m a little insulted 
sitting here that my needs and some of 
your needs [pointing to the audience] 
were not addressed,” she said. “There’s 
so much I could say right now, but I’m 
not prepared. But I would be more than 
happy to sit on that panel next year.”
“I feel really badly about that,” said 
Lopez. “I forgot, honestly. If we do

My question for you now is, ‘What are

that doesn’t happen again.”
Feedback on other lectures was very 
strong, according to Lopez, especially 
for the lecture entitled “Keeping the 
money you make” by Katherine 
Darragh Larson, a financial consult­
ant from .Merrill Lynch.
One of the more successful lectures, 
according to most of the students who 
attended it, was “Nuts & Bolts” — a 
practical, no-nonsense discussion of ho w 
to avoid getting cheated by an auto 
mechanic. The talk was led by Leah 
Moran, assistant service manager of 
Rohrich Toyota, in the Connan Room 
during the third and final session. 
“You know, women get very intimi­
dated when they walk into 
this man’s garage,” Moran 
said. “I see fear on the 
faces of the men too.... But 
you have to be able to ask 
questions. If you know 
about your car, you’re not 
going to get taken.”
The panel discussion on “Lov­
ing and Living ... Together” was sched­
uled by itself in the middle of the day, so 
that all interested students could attend. 
Four couples — including members ofthe 
CMU administration, faculty, and staff
— spoke about the difficulties of main­
taining a relationship.
“It’s beautiful right now, but don’t 
expect it to be so down the road,” said 
Saihou Njie, when asked what advice he 
could have used at the beginning of his 
realthionship with Valerie, his wife of
-------------------- 23 years. Njie drew an
analogy between being 
in a relationship and 
driving a Porsche down 
a five-lane highway 
which gradually be­
comes a muddy dirt 
road. “You have to 
know how to and care 
enough to get out of [the 
dirt road],” he said.
“[My wife and I] have 
seen a lot of backroads, but we are headed 
back onto the big-time highway.”
The conference ended in Rangos Hall, 
where closing commments were made 
and prizes — books on women’s issues 
and acrylic mugs-with candy stuffed 
inside them — were handed out by Mo­
saic organizers in a raffle.
Chris Cannon/Tartan Contributing Editor 
Keynote speaker Barrie Simpson related her experience in a male-managed workplace.
Kerri Ullucci, a CMU alum who helped 
create Mosaic last year, posed several 
questions-for attendees to think about 
in her concluding speech.
“So you’ve been to all these sessions 
and you’ve got all this new knowledge. 
My question for you now is, ‘What are 
you going to do with it?’ ”,
Ullucci added that it was important 
to spread Mosaic’s message of aware­
ness and activism in the issues affect­
ing women, so that the conference 
would represent more than an isolated, 
half-day event.
“Find a way to keep your feet wet in 
women’s issues, so it isn’t just some­
thing you do once in a blue moon,” Ulicci 
said. “Silence is a powerful and danger­
ous message. Don’t let it end here.... 
Help us take Mosaic out of this room.”

Album re-hashes old sounds
By BRADLEY W. ZIMMERMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
I’m well aware that there’s a large 
chunk of America waiting with baited 
breath for the South to lay claim to a 
section of the alternative music market. 
Strange how no matter which banner 
Southern guitar-based bands are labeled 
under, they always seem to sound like 
70s classic rock with differing produc­
tion values. Our latest example is a 
(gasp) five-piece from North Carolina 
called Jolene.
T WcF: JFlvhv 
T Wcal: In the Gloaming 
J CFrpaho: sRdv/WadhvdBdF:. 
T RvPFdt:
I’ll refrain from my usual indictment 
of the major label co-opting' of the alter­
native/college music genre of my youth 
and simply say that Jolene’s debut, In 
the Gloaming, is headed for an un­
eventful future in the also-ran bin.
With 14 tracks of slightly dirty 
guitar, monotonous bass, and 
clichéd melodies, Jolene succeeds 
in calling to mind a myriad of other 
lightweight “new alternative” 
bands. Playing the Name Game 
hasn’t been, this easy since the hey­
day of grunge-rock.
An underlying kinship with 
Counting Crows is built upon 
with references to Drivin’ &
Cryin’, the Gin Blossoms,
Cracker, and slight whiffs of 
the Dave Matthews Band. At no 
time does Jolene deviate from 
classic song structures, incorpo­
rate foreign instruments (key­
boards, strings), or flirt with other 
genres of music.
At the requisite times (“Recline 
to Sensible”), Jolene quotes a Led 
Zeppelin riff, an REM bridge, or a 
Pearl Jam motif. Yet never, does the 
band kick into high gear. They prefer 
to keep a laid-back, mid-tempo tone to 
the album.
This is not to say that the band is 
devoid of merit. If you can cut through

aging to avoid most cliches and avoiding 
dreadful rhyme schemes. A few songs 
glimmer with catchiness, namely the 
opener “Pensacola” and “So Sleepless 
You,” but eventually get bogged down 
with musical free-association.
Jolene is not a bad band, and In the 
Gloaming is not a bad album. The 
problem is that I’ve heard it before.
I’ve heard it many times before. I’ve 
been hearing it for the past three 
years on the radio and for 
even longer from countless 
other bands.
There is no distinctive face 
to this music, nothing which 
sets one band apart from the 
others except letters on this 
week’s playlist.
It’s simply a race to see 
who can craft the same 
melody first, and Jolene is 
indeed in the running. It 
really isn’t worth it to spend 
your money on the same 
CD again.
Chances are you already 
own it anyway — except with 
different artwork.
Female artist plays unique brand of folk
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
Ani DiFranco is a fish — a little fish 
in the big fishbowl that is the music 
industry. She owns her own Buffalo- 
based record label, Righteous Babe 
Records, on which she has produced 
12 albums. It must be difficult to swim 
without the' backing of a multi-million 
dollar company, but while other art­
ists are floating to the top of the fish­
bowl, DiFranco is still making sur­
prising and punchy albums. She swims 
on her own terms.
WcF: AhR DRFdahPF
Wcal: Little Plastic Castle
CFrpaho: RRgclvFi: Babv
DiFranco’s latest album, Little Plas­
tic Castle, finds her making more an­
gry commentary on the state of the 
world, gender, and the radio, among 
other topics. Of course, it’s diffi­
cult to ignore her obvious opposi­
tion to certain social conventions 
— sexuality, for one. Don’t try to 
tell her how to feel or how to act or 
what to do.
¦ Her most powerful statement 
comes in “Fuel,” which is half

Castle is the first we’ve seen 
from her since her long stint on 
the road last year, except for Living 
In Clip, a double-disc live album. 
Castle has a lot of the characteristics 
of DiFranco’s shows, and of her previ­
ous albums — roughness, a sense of 
spontaneity, rage. But the core of this 
album is DiFranco’s energetic, home­
grown acoustic guitar.
On “Gravel,” for example, DiFranco 
plays dissonant, complex riffs on the 
deep end of the guitar, which contrasts 
with her crisp voice. The song, lyrically 
and musically, sounds like a fight. She 
howls in places, her voice teetering 
between wailing and tightly-controlled - 
rhythm. After making an appearaiice X 
on Living In Clip, “Gravel” has become, ‘ 
one ofDiFranco’s signature pieces, with. 
her emotional, stripped-down brand of- 
high-energy folk.

Some are basic, with guitar, bass, anc|i- 
drums, while others use horns or styK‘

tracks on the album. The song has two 
distinct voices, one high and floating}

Band stays near rock’s roots
By ANDY FRANCIS

From start to finish, Creed’s 
debut album, My Own Prison, is 
like a look through alternative 
rock’s past. Creed’s influences are 
quite apparent, as the band bor­
rows elements from groups like 
Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, 
Silverchair, and 311. Still, they 
manage to toss in all of these 
ingredients, add a dash of heavy 
metal, and blend it all together to 
create an entertaining, fresh- 
sounding disc. My Own Prison 
contains enough clever riffing and 
style-shifting to more than make 
up for what could be perceived as 
a lack of originality.
WcF: Cdvvt 
Wcal: My Own Prison 
CFrpaho: WRht-Up 
RvPFdt:
My Own Prison certainly makes 
no bones about being a straight­
forward rock album. While many 
groups today experiment with 
computerized samples and drum 
loops, Creed comes at you with a 
classic guitar assault matched by 
lead vocalist Scott Stapp’s excep­
tionally personal lyrics. Early in 
the disc, the band sets the stan­
dard itself, with the two opening 
tracks, “Torn” and “Ode.” Both 
begin with a low-key intro and 
build step by step to a power- 
chord-filled finale. In addition, 
Creed avoids predictable song 
structures by constantly chang- 
. ing melodies and tempos.
Perhaps the least-appealing as­
pect of My Own Prison is Stapp’s 
vocal messages. While his Layne 
Staley-meets-EddieVedder voice 
is somewhat disconcerting at first, 
it complements the music well, 
particularly during “What’s This
Life For,” as he balances the pleas­
ant feel of the song with a melan­
choly atmosphere. However, 
Stapp spends too much of the disc 
in self-pity — nearly every track 
features lines like, “Torn, I’m 
filthy/Born in my own misery” or 
“Hang me, watch a while/Let me 
see you smile as I die.” Eventu­
ally, you want to inform him that 
angst went out of style several 
years ago.
The album would be substan­
tially better if Stapp and the rest 
of the band, guitarist Mark 
Tremonti, bassist Brian 
Marshall, and drummer Scott 
Phillips, had coordinated their 
finest efforts. The first single, 
the title track, is the emotional 
centerpiece of the album, yet is a 
relatively uninspiring musical 
effort. On the other hand, “In 
America” combines a paranoid- 
sounding guitar intro with an 
aggressive chorus to 
provide the album’s 
best soundscape, yet 
Stapp is lost in a point­
less criticism of the 
United States. Still, 
these songs are quite 
compelling, and, like 
the rest of the CD, a 
solid listen.
Creed will no doubt 
take some flak from the 
critical masses due to 
the extensive influ­
ences found through­
out My Own Prison. 
However, the average 
listener searching for 
something entertain­
ing will be pleased with 
this CD. Rather than 
trying to revolutionize 
the industry, Creed has 
simply made a good 
old-fashioned rock al­
bum which happens to

Remember Half-Baked, the

You know, the film starring and 
written by virtual unknown

think so.
And yet, as more evidence

Classic cast fails to save detective flick

it is questionable whether Newman’s

a Phillip Marlowe, or even the firm

¿doesn’t quite add up to greatness.

Company: PadarFihl
•! Paul Newman is Harry Ross, a private 
‘detective who has one client and doesn’t 
-get paid. Ross goes to Mexico to retrieve 
-his client’s 17-year-old daughter, Mel

friend, Jeff (Liev Schreiber). But Ross

he’s accidentally shot by Mel (Reese 
Witherspoon).
Hence, Ross needs a little time to get 
back on his feet and becomes the house 
detective for Catherine and Jack Ames 
(Susan Sarandon and Gene Hackman). 
Fast forward to the present: Ross is told 
to hand-deliver a package for Jack. But 
like any good detective story, the job the 
detective gets paid for isn’t the one he 
undertakes. Instead of delivering a 
“package,” Ross runs around Los Ange­
les trying to solve a blackmail scheme 
and a slew of murders, past and present.
L.A. is a great location; there’s sun 
and smog. The filmmakers have found 
some beautiful houses, including a little 
unfinished ranch designed by Frank 
Lloyd Wright. There’s a constant hint of 
nostalgia, corruption, and danger, but 
somehow I never felt Ross was threat­
ened by any of the three.
sort of there. Also, while it’s not hard to 
see why the film is called Twilight with 
a 73-year-old lead actor, it is difficult to 
see women swooning for him in the film.
The supporting cast is strong. Ifthere’s 
anyone in the cast you don’t recognize, 
then let me be the first to welcome you 
to the 20th century. The problem is that 
the cast is too recognizable, every bit 
character detracting from plot.
It wouldn’t be fair to call the plot 
the weakest part of the production, 
but it is flawed. It’s almost taken for 
granted that the protagonist in a 
detective story will have to follow a 
trail of corpses to find the real killer, 
and that the police list the detective 
himself as the prime suspect. This is 
sometimes a compelling device, but 
Twilight's script doesn’t add any­
thing to the formula. Ross has no 
motive to kill, and halfway through, 
the other suspects are killed off or 
incapacitated. This makes the 
backstory that Ross uncovers appear 
as mere filler until the film can have 
its climax: a Western type shoot-out, 
which is somehow appropriate given 
that James Gamer is in the film.
But the quirky characters are too 
distinct and overshadow the lead. The 
story is too contrived and the hero is too 
good to be true. While Twilight has its 
moments and follows the pattern to 
success, the sum doesn’t acheive great­
ness despite its fine components.
Art exhibits emphasize gender

men don’t have to be men, and women

transform themselves.”
“It’s kind of silly,” said Gabe Colwell- 
LeFleur, junior art major. “But glamor­
ously so.” Others took the light attitude 
towards glamour even further.
“[The exhibit! is kooky; it’s wacky; it’s 
hip; all the kids love it. It’s what’s hap­
pening to­
day,” said Dan 
Bruce, senior 
IM major.

terpoint to the 
Glamour Show 1998. It asked the ques­
tion: How much of gender is performative? 
In this case, much of the show was actual

and Enrique Sacasa, all senior art ma-

the show, said, “Guys can also be sensi­
tive, but it has to be filtered through 
bands like Journey.”
Hot Rods started as an offshoot of the 
Glamour Show, after the three male art­
ists talked with the female artists about 
.their various projects. “They both deal 
with gender roles and identity,” said 
Keegan. “They’re both images men and 
women can take or leave.”
“We wanted it to have a consistent 
theme, to give it more presence, so people 
will remember it,” said Lyons. As well as 
Perversions of having people remember the show, the 
Male Culture, artists wanted to create something that 
critiqued gender in a lighter fashion 
than is often done. “I think as far as 
gender issues are dealt with in art, we 
dealt with them playfully, which is a 
good thing, instead of dealing with them 
resentfully,” said Sacasa.
In the end, the shows we were about 
enjoying yourself, and making light of 
gender stereotypes. “We’re wanting to 
have fun with ritualistic male tenden- 
said Sacasa. For both male and
the expectations of glamour and women. 
The walls were painted blue and gold, 
one decorated with a series of mirrors, 
another with glamour shots of the art­
ists: Denise Delgado, a senior BHA ma­
jor, Natalia Mager, and Amy Marino, 
both senior art majors. Glamorous attire 
was preferred at the reception, but none 
was more glamorous than the artists. 
They wore snazzy dresses and gold roller 
skates, for “social mobility.”
“I like the mirrors,” said SDS master’s 
student Maciej Matyjas. “They make us 
dress up, so we’re the art.” The reception 
was also being videotaped, which added an 
extra level of interactivity to the exhibit.
In the back room, the artists set up 
something of a beauty salon. There were 
full-seat hair dryers along the wall and 
smaller hair dryers set into little boxes 
with lighted mirrors. The room was painted 
in pink and had a pink felt carpet.
The concept of the exhibit came from 
the artists’ experiences abroad in very 
male-dominated countries. “We were all 
hyper-aware of our image,” said Delgado. 
That got the three thinking about female 
image — the spur of the exhibit. Then 
they decided to get the glamour shots.
“We wanted to get glamour shots be­
cause it’s such an absurdity,” said 
Marino. Not only are the glamour shots 
absurd, so were the people working at 
the glamour studio. “They were saying 
things like, ‘Tilt your brains, tilt your 
brains, break your hand, break your 
hand,’ ” said Mager. “They didn’t know it 
was a joke for us.”
The show was a way for the people 
looking at the exhibit to play with the 
idea of glamour as well. Most people who 
came dressed in their finest glam 
threads. “People were telling me they 
bought things to wear especially for [the

wheel bolted to each column, right be­
side drawings ofmen doingmanly things, 
like diving and wrestling. The artists 
also displayed their work on the walls, 
Lyons displaying a series of color-washed 
prints, Keegan displaying various pieces 
juxtaposing images of physical male 
sports and copulation, and Sacasa dis­
playing several abstract pieces, one of 
which was about, as he said, “fantasy 
and masturbation, not necessarily per­
sonal, but in action. How certain actions 
are done for the mental pleasure of it.”
In the basement, the artists displayed 
video works they had put together. 
“We didn’t think the videos went with 
the rest of the show, but once they 
were together, they really did,” said 
Keegan. The series of videos included 
Lyons’ pieces on television preachers 
and Keegan’s short film on machismo 
in basketball.
The high point of the 
show, though, was the per­
formance aspect of the re­
ception. Out front, Sacasa 
barbecued hot dogs for 
Frame patrons (because 
guys love to barbecue).
“I like how they trans­

Sacasa’s paintings. The bar

With ten years and a punk rock 
persona under their belt, 
Superchunk re-emerges with 
their new album Indoor Living. 
Touting a newly purchased vin­
tage steam organ, their indie- 
punk sound has shifted slightly 
with songs that have mellowed 
out in tone, with more reliance on 
orchestration — strings, vibes, 
and the organ all work to meet 
their usual efforts, but even the 
most avid Superchunk fans won­
dered how the new material 
would hold up on stage at last 
Friday’s concert at Graffiti.
The show fared well as the au­
diences reacted postively to
Superchunk’s move towards a 
more popish side. Songs like 
“Hyper Enough” and “Water 
Hands” (the album’s first single) 
gave listeners a glimpse into the 
band’s future direction. They 
turned out a tight performance, 
although many of the band’s 
harder, more punk-sounding 
songs were left out.
Also noticeably absent were 
popular favorites, namely 
“Mower” and “Package Thief,” 
from their album On the Mouth, 
and “Driveway to Driveway,” the 
song that put Superchunk on 
the map. Maybe if the show — 
which gave us an ample taste of 
their new music — had been 
longer than the 45-minute span 
that seemed to fly by, they would

In recent interviews, singer/ 
guitarist Mac McCaughan said 
that the band is looking to in­
crease record sales. While this 
is obvious with the sound of the 
new album, they have managed 
to retain enough to keep long­
time listeners. McCaughan and 
bassist Laura Ballance own and 
operate Merge Records, a pos­
sible influence for the band’s re­
directed approach.
A product of North Carolina, a 
haven for American independent 
rock bands, Superchunk’s music 
follows suit in style — loud and 
fast music from the late’80s — but 
they have talent for songwriting 
that has set them apart. Most 
punk rock bands can pull off a 
certain sound, but Superchunk 
has managed to write good records 
for 10 years now.
Superchunk spent the 
greater part of their musical 
career recording and perform­
ing under Matador Records, 
until the early ’90s, when they 
moved back to Merge, with a 
new tour and a new album. 
Indoor Living brings together 
these same elements with sug­
ary vocals from McCaughan to 
create peppy music, more so 
than in previous records.
Knownas the band that didn’t 
sell out, Superchunk proved 
they still have no such inten­
tions. With McCaughan and 
Ballance, along with drummer 
Jim Wilbur and guitarist Jon 
Wurster, they seem to want to 
expand their base beyond its 
traditional following.
Sequel gives old plot new face
By DAVE ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
You wouldn’t know it from the 
title, but U.S. Marshals is actu­
ally a sequel to a not-so-little film 
called The Fugitive. Once we make 
the connection, though, we begin 
to wonder why it was downplayed 
in the advertising. Was the asso­
ciation unwanted? Does the film 
differ greatly from the old mate­
rial and only follow it in superfi­
cial details? While I’ll postpone 
answering the first question, I do 
know that U.S. Marshals follows 
a plot structure very similar to 
that of The Fugitive.Î
What: U.S. Marshals 
Director: sliadl BaRdt 
Company: Wadhvd BdF:.
The entire supporting cast is 
back, led by Tommy Lee Jones as 
Samuel Gerard. Working as a 
deputy marshal in Chicago, he 
must chase another fugitive. This 
time, Gerard is after Mark Rob­
erts (Wesley Snipes). Picked up 
after a traffic accident, the police 
discover his identity is false; he 
stands accused of murdering two 
government agents in the U.N. 
building. Although he denies it, 
he’s flown back to New York. Also 
on board the flight is Gerard. 
When an in-flight incident causes 
a crash landing, the action be­
gins. Roberts, who by now has a 
different name, escapes, and 
Gerard must track him through 
the country. Aiding Roberts is his 
girlfriend (Irène Jacob). On the 
other side, Robert Downey Jr.
joins the marshals as an agent 
from another government branch.
The action that follows has a 
different feel from The Fugitive 
— although we are shown Snipes 
trying to prove his innocence just 
as Harrison Ford did in the past 
film, the action doesn’t seem 
grounded anywhere. We got to 
know Richard Kimbal, but Mark 
Roberts remains somewhat dis­
tant. Neither does the film let us 
get to know the marshals any 
better. Their characters return, 
but we don’t see into their psy­
ches as the title suggests. Com­
pleting my earlier thoughts on 
the subject, I would guess that 
this film is not supposed to be a 
strict rehashing, but instead fo­
cus on the other half of the equa­
tion. Before we had the escaped 
prisoner, and now we have the 
people trying to catch him. If I’m 
right, the script is a little off.
- U.S. Marshals isn’t a bad movie. 
It’s capable in all the right spots, 
with decent acting, direction, and 
everything else, but nothing’s 
remarkable. The biggest prob­
lems lie in the screenplay by John 
Pogue, who .also scripted the dis­
appointing Eraser. The dialogue 
between the different branches 
of government agents in the film 
feels forced, and when Gerard 
goes after Roberts towards the 
end, we’re left wondering how 
this fits into what we’ve already 
been shown of him. This is made 
worse by the ending which is 
much too happy and doesn’t mesh 
with what we’ve seen for the past 
two hours.
Still, there’s some moderate 
entertainment hiding in here. If 
one sacrifices oneself to the film 
and doesn’t think about tiny 
little things such as The 
Fugitive’s superiority to its se-

In U.S. Marshals, Tommy Lee Jones once again plays Lt. Gerard.
Getting past the idea that all 
this has been done before, and 
better — like Gerard’s “search 
every outhouse” speech and the 
Con Air feel of the plane sequence
quel, the plane taking a horren­
dously long time to crash, or the 
curiously quiet streets of New 
York, U.S. Marshals is a decent 
way to pass the time.

peared in the movie. While it’s 
common to see one or two songs 
which have been “inspired” by 
the movies whose soundtrack 
they are on, an astounding 
number of songs on this 
soundtrack are the result of 
such “inspiration.”
In fact, the only thing that 
the songs on this CD seem to 
have in common is their 
theme. With titles like “(I’m 
In Love With) Mary Jane,” “I 
Get Lifted,” and “Who’s Got 
the Light?” just take a wild 
guess what that theme is. No 
matter what the style, all 
these groups really seem to 
love their pot. On “Farmyard
Connection,” ska group 
The Specials even sing 
that “We need to sleep in 
the field to protect our 
weed.” Then there is Home 
Grown, its name a testa­
ment to marijuana use, a 
band that is so terrible it 
must have been created 
by Universal for the ex­
press purpose of appear­
ing on this CD.
The one reward of sit­
ting through this CD is 
the last song, “Pack the 
Pipe” by The Pharcyde. 
The beat is catchy, the lyr­
ics clever, and the perform­
ers enthused. It was actu­
ally good enough to rouse 
my suspicions. I checked 
the sleeve of the 
soundtrack and saw that 
“Pack the Pipe” came from 
a 1992 Pharcyde album, 
the only song not produced 
for this CD. Ah, that ex­
plains it.

In the classic Shakespearean play, Julius Caesar was warned 
by a soothsayer to "beware the Ides of March." Those omi­
nous words held true when Caesar died at the hands of 
Brutus and others. Shakespearean actor Patrick Stewart 
will star in Moby Dick on the Ides of March this year. This 
classic Melville tale chronicles a captain's mad quest to 
search for the large white whale. Perhaps if Ahab had a 
cell phone, he could have called in for backup. But then 
again, Ahab could have benefitted from transporters and 
phasers and starships named Enterprise. In hindsight, Ahab 
could have picked a safer profession than chasing a big 
whale — like acting in many Shakespearean plays.

Many moons, ago, Vox Populi was a whale hunter. He 
liked doing this because it raised a nice profit and you get 
to see a lot of blubber. After serving on board with Cap­
tain Ahab, Mr. Vox changed his mind and became an el­
ephant hunter. He simply adored ivory. But with all of the 
fire that poachers come under, Mr. Vox has given up all 
other forms of wildlife to chase the mean members of the 
female population.

NEVERNEVERLAND:
J.M. Barry is rolling over in his grave as you read this. For him Never
Never Land “was the second star to the left and straight on ’til morning.” It was 
a simple yet magical place where children were free to follow their imagination 
into whatever adventure they wanted. However, the stories for this issue lack 
the beauty of Never Never Land.
In 1904, when Barry wrote Wendy and Peter, (the original book that 
was adapted into Peter Pan) legislation to get children out of factories had just 
been passed. It revealed a social change over the attitudes toward children. We 
see it as a statement about how children should be using their imagination to 
enjoy characters like Tinkerbell and Captain Hook, rather than fear people like 
the boss or the foreman.
After interpreting the theme in this light, we decided to choose sub­
missions that dealt with the themes of responsibility and freedom, hard times 
and bad times. Some of the pieces feature children, whereas others feature 
young adults, but we can relate to all of them. For us, Never Never Land is a cel­
ebration of childrens new found freedom.
Ryan Donovans Rising Above Snakes, brings together the freedom of 
living, the torture of mental disease, and the pleasures of a driver’s license. Big 
things come in small packages, as with Jeremy Lewit s “When the Fairy Tale 
Departs” and “Now we are Captains” (a take on A.A. Milne’s title, “Now We 
are Six.”) And kicking off the issue is Alex Lewin’s Asphalt — a disturbing but 
well written story that throws the reader head-long into the emptiness and con­
fusion that all youths go through.
This issue’s designers drew from varying sources of inspiration to pro­
vide a visual form for the ideas expressed in the texts. Ethereal imagery in a spa­
cious layout communicates the light-hearted feel of Jeremy Lewit’s poems. The 
unusual typographic mix and old-style mechanical drawings on the spreads for 
Rising Above Snakes display the innerworkings of an insane mind. Asphalts con­
tains similar content, this time expressed through disjointed imagery and nar­
row columns of type. The photographic negatives convey the narrator’s 
detatchment from his own life.
Never Never Land was a whole other realm where Peter and Wendy 
were free to pursue adventure. It was beautiful and dangerous, not unlike our 
world. Sometimes we just need to be reminded of that.

“Jesus Christ,” Gebhart muttered and ran his hand through his hair.
“This was an accident, boys. This was not your fault,” Sarge shouted to 
the platoon.
There was more gunfire and the platoon hit the ground. Private 
McNeely had shot himself. “Jesus, kid,” Sarge mumbled..“Start laying out 
the bodies, I’m gonna radio headquarters."
I almost let Charlie get by me, I was so lost in memory. He would have 
walked right past me if he hadn’t stopped to pet someone’s dog. Probably 
some sort of code he’s tapping out on the dog’s head. If it is a dog. I rush up 
and grab him by the collar. Suddenly, he smells real bad. I jerk him into the 
alley and throw him to the ground. “Give me my license back!” I kick him 
in the stomach and he doubles over. “I need to drive again!” I kick him 
again, in the face. He’s got the worst smell on him now, like Gebhart after he 
lost his legs and the trees burst open. I pull my gun to avoid that happening 
again. One belly wound is enough. I shoot him twice. That’s what they 
always told us at boot camp. Once may not be enough, and three or more is 
just wasting ammo. Anyone who shoots another person three or more times 
is probably getting a little wacko in the head, if you know what I mean.
I stick my gun inside my jacket and walk away. That’ll teach him to not 
give me a license. Nobody can stop me from driving, not no license boy, no 
way. I’ll go back to the DMZ tomorrow, to the license place to see if I can 
get one now that Charlie is out of the picture. And then I’ll get my forklift 
back, and drive until God tells me to stop.
In the morning, I call work and tell them I can’t come in until I can 
drive. The DMV doesn’t open until ten, so I eat breakfast and watch car­
toons. That’s what I miss most about my time before. Cartoons. They show 
you a perfect world where the rabbit always outwits the hunter, where people 
get shot and are only embarrassed, where an avalanche is only a punchline. If 
the jungle was a cartoon, we could have apologized to Pvt. Vinon. Instead 
we have this world full of snakes and machine guns.
After I’ve filled my belly with food and my head with cartoons, I ride the 
bus down to the DMV. I think I can get a license now, I did something to 
change their minds about me. I don’t remember exacdy what it was I did, 
though. I guess I’ll find out soon enough.
I get off the bus and go inside the DMV. The license guy looks at me 
and I smile to him. Good thing I came early, before the swarms of other 
people who want to drive come to get their licenses. Maybe the computer 
will tell them they can’t have one, section eight, or maybe they’ve passed all 
the tests and made friends with the computer, and get their license. I take a 
number and wait for somebody to say it. They do pretty soon and I walk up 
to their desk.
It’s the license guy, the one who wouldn’t let me drive. But his eyes don’t 
smile and his teeth don’t stare this time, and he smells real bad. He’s not as 
scary this time, so I feel better. “Can I help you?”
“Yes,” I say in a big voice, “I would like a license now.”
He glanced over to the testing machine and then to someone in back 
before looking at me again. “Um... well, you see...”
“I’ve already passed the tests.” I smile at him again.
He chews on his thumbnail for a moment, then hands me a piece of 
paper. “Fill this out,” he says, then steps back to talk to someone.
I write my name on the paper, along with all my other statistics, just like 
recruitment day. Height, weight, eye and hair color, address, social security 
number. I look up to see him talking to a man on the phone. Quickly, he 
turns back to me and smiles, but not a real smile. He smells too bad for that. 
When I’m done, he takes me over and puts me in front of a machine mount­
ed on a tripod. I panic for a moment, until I realize it’s only a camera, and 
he’s gonna take my picture for the license. I’m gonna get a license and drive
again! I smile real big for the camera and it flashes at me. Not the bad kind 
of flash that can scar your belly, but the good kind, so the camera can see your 
whole face.
“It’ll just be a moment.” The license guy takes something out of the 
camera and nods to the man talking on the phone. After a moment, he 
hands me a license with my name and picture on it. I stare at the license for 
a long time, until the license guy says, “That’s good for seven years.”
I smile at him and nod, and I would have smiled at the guy on the 
phone, but he was gone. I go outside to take my new license home, but 
someone says, “There he is, that guy.”
I look up to see who said that, and there are policemen pointing guns at 
me. “Don’t move! You're under arrest!”
“It s okay!” I try to tell them. “I’m on your side!” I reach into my pocket 
to take my license out.
“Put your goddam hands up!” More guns are pointed at me. Don’t they 
know they’re making a mistake? “Stop right there!”
Finally, I find my license and take it out to show it to them. “See, it’s 
okay-”
Suddenly, there’s a flash and my arm hurts real bad. “My arm hurts, mis­
ter.” why did they hurt me i said i was on their side i just want to go home i 
just want to go home

Inside my barracks, it’s an utter pit. Sarge would kill me if he saw this 
mess. If he was able to, that is. I pull my pistol out of the clear plastic case it 
came in. It’s made by some company called Tyco, but it sure looks like a Colt 
45. A soldier’s last resort. This pupper’ll save your ass in the tightest of situ­
ations. Like now. I wouldn’t be here if every brain cell wasn’t screaming 
alerts, but it would seem as if there’s no choice. He already got Gebhart.
The weirdest thing about these Tyco pistols is the ammo. I load the last 
of my deposit of the little red plastic bullets strung together in a ring into the 
gun. These litde red pellets are nothing like the burly .50 cal we shot from 
the helicopter last week. I leave my barracks with my pistol tucked away.
The DMZ’s no place for unconcealed firearms.
I hop on another transport towards the DMZ, down in the city. Gotta 
be quiet on this ride, who knows how many of these guys are with the gooks. 
And the higher-ups would have a shit fit if they knew what I was up to. But 
it’s for the drive of my country. A country that can’t drive is worthless, and 
our boy aims to take it away. Not on my watch, buddy.
I get off the transport in front of the DMZ and scan the area. Clear 
from my. station, Sarge. I walk into the DMZ like a damned fool, right into 
a swarm of a thousand gooks. Figures they’d all gather here, it’s the safest 
place .in this whole goddamed country. What the hell am I doing here, 
armed to the gills like John Wayne, ready to shoot my way into history? But 
that’s just what I’ll be doing. Making history. Fighting-for my God given 
American right to drive my life, liberty, and in pursuit of happiness.
I decide prudence is the better part of valor and walk out. Charlie’s 
there, all right. This just isn’t the right time. I can wait a thousand years for 
him to come out, and he will come out sometime. Fortunately for me, there’s 
a gun shop called Toys ‘R’ Us across the street, so I can load up on a little 
more ammo.
I walk into the gun shop. This is a funny kind of gun shop, but it’s 
where I got my pistol at. They sell all sorts of toys here, right beside the 
guns. I saw.an eight year old kid buy a sub-machine gun the other day, and 
his mother paid for it. Soon, we’ll be just like the jungle, where a day with­
out an armed child was unusual and a day without a dead child was lucky.
The world’s going to shit. Ever since Kennedy was shot and that fruitcake 
Lyndon Johnson came into office, we’ve been sliding into the depths of hell.
But I’ve got better things to do right now than worry about the decline 
of man. I pick up three more packs of ammo and head outside to stake the 
DMZ out. Finding a good ambush point is always hard in urban conflicts. 
Give me a good rocky hillside and I’ll find a thousand places to kill you from. 
I find myself a heap of refuse to sit in and pretend I’m a vagrant, however far­
fetched that may be. It could be hours we spend here. Just like that time 
outside of Da Nang.
We were supposed to hold a supply road between Da Nang and God 
knows where, one that the VC were using frequently those days. The higher- 
ups were pissed as hell, they wanted the road all to themselves. So it was 
down to us grunts to do the dirty work. We sat in those bushes for hours on 
end, smoked a little Cambodian weed, and waited. By the time a convoy 
came by, half the platoon was asleep. What a nightmare. Gebhart woke us 
all when he started punching holes in the trucks with his heavy machine gun. 
What an alarm clock that was. Chak-chak-chak-chak-. Once he got started, 
the rest of us got our asses in gear to help him out. We couldn’t let him be 
the only one to shoot some gooks that day.
But then the haze cleared, and Sarge was the first to notice the truck’s 
markings. “This is a US convoy!” No one said anything, we just stared at the 
dead convoy and watched some of them bum. I walked up to one of the 
trucks and looked inside the cab. The driver, a boy of about eighteen, had his 
chest busted open, right next to a patch that read “Pvt. Vinon.” The kid rid­
ing shotgun was dead, too.

I arrive at where the landscapers arc working. “Jim sent me over to help 
lay sod,” I say. I smile at Derrick.
I Ic points to a big pile of sod. “Get to it, then, boy. Times a wastin’.” 
The sod comes in little rectangles of dirt and grass, and we have to place 
them next to each other just so. They have to look nice, Coo. Sometimes I 
say, “Hup, two, three, four,” or “Ooo-rah!” to myself when I work with the 
landscapers. Derrick and his son, Kyle, always smile at me when I lay sod. 
That means I’m doing a good job.
While I’m throwing patches of sod down, Jim comes up to me and taps 
me on the shoulder. He says my name like an apology. “The DMV just 
called us. We can’t let you drive the forklift anymore.” I don’t say anything 
for a real long time. “Look, I know how much you liked driving the forklift, 
but the guys at the DMV said we ain’t supposed to let you drive without a 
license. I’m sorry.” He starts to smell a little, so he walks away.
“What are you standin’ around for, section eight? Lay some sod!” Kyle 
shouts to someone.
Derrick glares af his son. “Kyle, watch, your mouth!” And then to me, 
“Get a move on, we ain’t paying you to stare.”
“I can’t drive sod anymore. I’m not allowed to.” I feel like throwing up.
Derrick and Kyle look at each other and shrug. I hate their secret lan­
guage, the one all fathers and sons have with each other. They talk behind 
everyone’s back in their little language.
Damn the DMZ! I can’t drive anymore, and it’s all their fault, those bas­
tards. The DMZ must be where the license place is, a convenient hiding 
place for them. No guns for Charlie, not there. That’s where the license guy 
is, Charlie, laughing at me. He’s like a poisonous snake, like the one Gebhart 
found while we were patrolling the jungle.
“Damn, check this sucker out! Think he’s dangerous?” Gebhart wan­
dered over to the snake, then exploded.
“Jesus, what was that?” S.arge roared.
Gebhart was still alive and wailing. “Oh, God, my legs, my legs...”
Then the jungle started flashing. Friends of mine started screaming as 
bullets tore through them. Sarge was yelling at us, but I couldn’t make out 
what he was saying over the noise. I ran over to Gebhart. His legs were just 
stumps, like somebody strapped five pound of T-bone steak to his hips and 
sauteed them in blood. “Gebhart, you okay?” Then something punched me 
real hard in the stomach. I forgot what happened until I arrived at the hospi­
tal, where the doctors told me that Gebhart was dead, Sarge was dead, every­
one was dead.
This snake’s not gonna get me like he got Gebhart. I’ve got to get back 
to camp and get my pistol before I go after Charlie. One way or the other,
I’ll get my drive back from those bastards at the Demilitarized Zone. I walk 
out of the work camp with one of the officers shouting at me. “Sorry, boss, 
this one’s personal.”
“You fuckin’ lunatic! Get back here!”
I wait at the pick up point until thirteen hundred hours, when the trans­
port comes by and picks me up. I have to pay for this ride. Never seen that 
before, but then again, this isn’t my company. These must be new recruits, 
you can smell them a mile away. The jittery little greenhorns are probably all 
shook up from some story their drill sergeant told them at boot camp. 
Probably wasn’t nearly enough. I try to crack a joke, but it goes over like 
refrigerators in Alaska. With the increasing smell, I ride the rest of the way 
in silence.
I get off near my barracks, saluting the driver on the way out. Theirs is a 
tough job. They drop all these young kids off to die in the jungle, and the 
worst part is, they know exactly what’ll happen to those kids out there. Like 
leading cows to slaughter.

They wont let me drive anymore. That’s exactly the idnd of thing they’d do 
to an honest man like me. Everywhere I go I see their mark, even on those 
people I call friends. They won’t let me drive without a license now and they 
aren’t going to let me have one.
I never needed a license before. “Here’s a jeep,” they said. “Drive.” Or 
“Here’s an M-16. Drive.” No one worried about little things like licenses, 
the trees were liable to erupt into a sea of flashes and noise, and you didn’t 
have to show your license before you drove back. But they still make me work.
I build houses. That’s where I am now, building houses. Jim the 
Foreman comes over to me. “We need you to bring the forklift over to Gary. 
He’s cleaning out unit thirty, and they need their trash bins emptied.” Jim 
and the others let me drive here. They’re good people, much better than the 
people on the bus I take to get here.
The bus people smell bad, like garter snakes we used to chase as kids. 
We’d chase them until we caught them and they pooped their fear on our 
hands. The people in the trees smelled like that too, only much worse.
When someone smells that bad, they’re liable to erupt into a sea of flashes 
and noise. You gotta cut them down first. They’d do the same.
That’s why they watch me. That’s why they won’t let me get a license. 
Because I know how people are. They’re all afraid of someone else becoming 
a flash and hurting them, so they do it first. The guy at the license place 
knew this when I walked in the door, he was waiting for me. His eyes smiled 
at me when I came in, wet with hunger. His toothy stare gleamed bright 
white as I stepped up to the counter. And he didn’t smell much at all. He 
said I couldn’t have a license because of something his computer told him, 
whatever that is. I took the test, too, and answered everything right, just like 
before. But the computer told him I couldn’t have a license, section eight dis­
charge. He smiled at his confusing words and waited for me to leave. I did.
But I can still drive the forklift at work, to empty the garbage bins by 
unit thirty. The forklift is better to drive than anything, except maybe heli­
copters, though I didn’t really get to drive them. Driving’s what I’m good at, 
better than anything. And the forklift I drive is real good at picking stuff up.
it looks like my tonka truck when all the trash falls down and makes a 
real big noise then i dump a lot of stuff into a big box it goes boom like the 
other stuff i can drive around all day and make big noises pull the lever fork 
goes up whcee beep beep goes the horn when i push it and i drive some more 
“Hey partner,” Jim taps the side of the forklift and I look at him. “All 
the trash bins are done, so could you help Derrick with the sod?”
I come back to myself slowly. “Yeah, uh, sure.”
“You okay?” he asks, pulling his sunglasses down.
“Yeah, I’m okay.” I climb out of the forklift and start walking. I hate 
when that happens, when I become dumb. There were all these doctors when 
I came back from the jungle, after I was shot in the belly. A belly wound 
hurts worse than anything, believe me. I laid in the hospital for months 
doped up on morphine, and I was still crying most of the time. Or screaming.
The doctors came to me one day, when I was conscious for most of the 
time. “We’re going to have to recommend giving you a section eight dis­
charge. You’ve got post-traumatic stress syndrome, along with a fragmented 
personality.” I just stared at them. “We’re also going to recommend that you 
get yourself looked over at St. Stephen’s Mental Ward when you get back.” I 
had no idea what they were talking about. I’d never heard of this “St. 
Stephen’s” place, and I still haven’t.
What the doctors said means that I get dumb sometimes, and these 
other people who are still me, but different, take over what I am doing when 
I get dumb. That’s why I can still drive when I’m dumb. If I ever got too 
dumb to drive, I wouldn’t want to live anymore. Maybe I’d be too dumb to 
care at that point.

p— lOA Alex Lewin 11
I don’t make a habit out of driving my parents’ car — I mean, I’m'only fourteen. And when I drive, I drive slow and watch out for everything, and even pull over to let some impatient drivers pass me. I’m not taking any chances.
I have a girlfriend. Leslie. And I think I’m in love with her. I want her so 
bad and I know that this is our chance to be alone together, for the first time. 
My parents in Reno, hers in God-knows-where. London or Paris. Leslie’s 
beautiful. Thin, like a stick, but not like an Ethiopian kid or anything. Her 
hair is long and blond and straight, and I always tell her she should be a 
model, which makes her blush. We’ve been physical before, a lot of kissing 
and heavy breathing, all sloppy and hot, and we put our hands all over each
other. I’m never happier than when we’re alone together. It’s like we’ve got all 
the time in the world, no pressures, nobody else bothering us. And now that 
we’ve been going out for a couple months, we both feel ready to go all the 
way. Neither of us has said it, but when it turned out both of our parents 
would be away on the same weekend, we just started making plans about how 
I could get down to her house, and the reason why was obvious.
I’m in Brentwood now, about five minutes from her place. I wonder how 
long it’ll be before we do it. How much longer do I have to be a virgin? No 
more than an hour. Maybe two. Let’s say two. In two hours, I won’t be a vir­
gin anymore. Guys talk about it — “gettin some” — but how many of ’em 
really mean it? I will.
As I think about what it’s going to be like, my eyes focus 011 the left -1 urn 
signals of the two cars in front of me. They start out in sync, bur slowly move 
apart, farther and farther, until it’s one and then the other, one and then the 
other, like a heartbeat, and as the e.ir- 
start moving further but into the inter 
section, start turning left, the turn 
nals come closer and closer again, .uul 
it makes me think of me and Leslie, 
and what would it be like to have her 
body be—
And then, what the hell, I’m 
moving sideways, no longer in control of 
the car. I step on the brakes, and there’s 
a loud, long screech. I shut my eyes and 
put all my weight on the brake and wait 
for everything to stop moving.
Holy Christ, what have I done:
I just stay like that, my fists 
clenched around the steering wheel, im 
foot pushing the brake, my eyes 
squeezed shut. I feel like I could freeze time, stop this moment and wail for 
whatever had just happened to sort itself out around me.
There’s a hard knock on my window. I open my eyes and I’m looking .11 
this big blond haired guy pressing his face against the window. I slowly open 
the door and get out and he’s pissing in his pants, going on about what a 
goddamn idiot I am and I’d better have insurance or he was gonna sue my 
ass. A tall guy, lean, with blond hair, a business suit and a silk tie.
“What the hell were you doing}'." he shouts. “Answer me!” I look at our 
cars. He’s got a Mercedes. His front section is crumpled, and the passenger 
side door of my car — my parents’ car, and holy shit it starts to hit me how 
much trouble I’m in — the passenger-side door is smashed in. If someone 
had been sitting there, they’d be dead meat.
The guy’s screaming his head off. We're right in the middle of the inter­
section and cars are weaving around us slowly, and lines of traffic are begin­
ning to build up in all four directions.
“You went through a red light!” he says.
“Yeah,” I mutter. “I did.”
“What the fuck did you do that for?”
“I don’t know,” is all I can say.
“Goddamn kids,” he says.
“Should we move our cars out of the intersection?”
“No, I don’t think we should. I’d like to exchange information first.” 
Exchange information. That’s probably what this guy does for a living.
“Let me see yoyr driver’s license,” he says.
Oh shit. Oh man, this was bad. Real fuckin’ bad. “I don’t hafta show you 
my driver’s license.”

---------------------------------------------------

“Look, kid. This was your fault! 
I’m not gonna let...” He stops. He 
looks at me for a long time. “How 
old are you?”
Son of a bitch. Big, blonde, 
business fucker. “Sixteen, man,” I 
say, but it’s obvious he doesn’t 
believe me. He goes back to his car, 
reaches in and picks up his phone. 
No way! I go over to him, say,
“Man, you don’t hafta do that. Don’t 
do that!” \
“Forget it, kid!” he says, the 
phone at his ear.
“Come on, man! Oh shit!” All I 
can do is go to my car, bend down 
and let my head drop on the trunk. I 
put my hands on the back of my 
neck and squeeze tight and try not 
to cry. I don’t want to cry in front of 
this prick. Oh man, take it easy.
Take it easy, this isn’t so bad. I 
might still be able to get out of this, 
maybe even get the car fixed before 
Mom and Dad get home. But 
behind me I hear him talking into 
the phone: “Yes, we’ve got an acci­
dent at Barrington and Idaho. It was 
the other guy’s fault, and he’s under 
sixteen. I thought you might want 
to send a few units over here.”
A few units. He’s schmoozing 
with the cops, trying to speak their 
language.
“Thank you,” he says and hangs 
up. I turn to look at him. “You’re in 
trouble kid,” he says.
“Fuck you, man!”
“Don’t you talk to me like that,” 
he says and takes a step towards me. 
I’d back off if it hadn’t been for the 
“you.” Don’t you talk to me like that.. 
Like I was his kid, like he had
power over me ’cause he was older. 
Bullshit, man. And I tell him so, I 
say, “Man, I’ll talk to you however 
the fuck I want.”
He pushes me. Both hands on 
my shoulders and the son of a bitch 
sends me back a few feet, but I stay 
up. And I go right back at him, I 
charge that fucker, and he has his 
arms wrapped around me as we 
both slam into his precious fuckin’ 
automobile. I know his knee is com­
ing before it hits, but I don’t have 
time to react, and the pain shoots 
from my groin up my side and down 
my leg, and the black pavement is 
coming up towards me real fost. 
When it hits, it scrapes the side of 
my face and a couple teeth are 
knocked loose and that sends anoth­
er bolt of pain through my jaw and 
into my head. I roll onto my back, 
one hand on my head, the other on 
my balls. A drop of hot blood moves 
fast down my cheek.
“Oh shit!” comes the guy’s voice 
from somewhere above me. “You 
okay there, kid?” His hand grabs my 
shoulder and starts pulling me up. 
There are a few other figures around 
me now, people who had been spec­
tators but now feel obligated to get 
involved, and I know there’s no way, 
no fuckin’ way this rich prick would 
be helping me up if all these people 
weren’t watching him. I push him 
away from me, push his chest with 
one hand and catch a feel of his 
smooth, shiny tie. “Piss off,” I say, 
and the next thing I’m looking at is 
a cop car. Coming towards the 
intersection from down the street, 
and right then I know that I’m
screwed worse than I’ve ever been. 
Two fucked-up cars, me at the 
wheel, me having caused it, me, a 
fourteen-year-old kid whose parents 
are in Reno. They’d come back early 
and I’d be in jail, and they’re gonna 
be pissed, with me being arrested 
and Mr. Mercedes breathing “law­
suit” down their necks. And the 
only thing I can think of is to get 
the hell out of here.
I run. My feet pound the pave­
ment as I sprint to the sidewalk and 
down the street, away from the 
black-and-white. I’m pretty skinny, 
but I’ve always been a fast runner, 
and now I put everything I have 
into it, all my energy, all my breath.
I run and never look back.
I cross the street, feeling a little 
dizzy, like when you get up too fast, 
but I keep going, across the pave­
ment, onto someone’s lawn, around 
the side of a house, and I just, keep 
going. I run so hard my legs hurt, 
my sides hurt, and I don’t know 
who’s behind me or how close they 
are. I just keep going, out onto 
another street, turning right, then 
left, and through some kiddie play­
ground until I just can’t run any­
more, and I slump against a Jungle 
Gym, coughing, my sides aching. 
The metal is cool against my face 
and it vibrates as the kids play on it.
Gotta keep moving, gotta keep 
moving. At least find a place to 
hide. And the nearest thing is a rope 
bridge connected to a slide, and 
underneath the bridge where it 
meets the slide is a bit of space that 
I crawl into and sit wrapped up in a 
tight ball, while the kids over my

head sprint across the rattling 
bridge, the sun high above them. 
They play and shout and are happy, 
and for a second I kind of want to 
join them. Their mothers watch, 
and some of the mothers play with 
the kids. I wonder how many of 
these kids will want to play with 
their mothers and fathers five or ten 
years from now. I used to look for­
ward to going somewhere with my 
parents. Now I don’t even like shar­
ing a house with them. We don’t 
like each other. We’re not mean to 
each other or anything; we’re just 
not nice either. And you can tell 
that the other person may love you, 
but they sure don’t like you. We 
never talk about it, though. If you 
don’t talk about something long 
enough, eventually you start to 
trick yourself into believing that 
it’s gone away.
I don’t know how long I’m 
there, but finally it’s time for the 
mothers to take the kids home and 
the sky starts to darken, and it’s 
pretty clear I lost theicops or who­
ever might’ve been chasing me. 
When the noise of the kids is gone, 
and when the sun is down and the 
sky is purple, I crawl out of my 
dusty hole and my joints crack, my 
neck aches.
I feel safe now, at night. I can’t 
be recognized from very far away, 
and it’s refreshing to be able to walk 
somewhere. If I have to do anymore 
running, I’m gonna collapse. I’m so 
tired. But I keep walking, until it’s 
really dark, and I can feel blisters on 
my feet ’cause my sneakers are old, 
and soon the sidewalks and pave­
ment start to press against my feet, 
instead of the other way around, and 
each step sends pain into my ankles. 
I keep looking up, at the sky, and 
just when you think it can’t get any 
darker, ten minutes later you look up 
again and somehow it is darker up 
there, and darker down here, and 
you’re even more tired, and it’s get­
ting pretty late.
Then I’m there, and it takes a 
lot of energy to ring that bell, and I 
can’t wait for her to open that door 
so I can just fall over and go to 
sleep. When the door opens, she’s 
surprised as hell and all I can say is, 
“I need to lie down.” She brings me 
inside and leads me to the sofa in 
the living room, and when I lie back 
into those pillows, I expect softness 
and warmth, but the couch is very 
uncomfortable — the seat pillows 
are too soft and the back pillows are 
too hard. I sink, awkwardly into the 
sofa and my bacl^aches. Leslie goes 
into the kitchen and comes back 
with a glass of water, which I drink 
slow because it hurts to swallow.
“What happened?” she says.
“I hit a car. The cops chased 
me.” I squirm.
“Are you serious?”
I don’t have the energy to 
respond. I watch the light glimmer 
in Leslie’s hair and I just want to fall 
asleep. I want to touch her hair, her 
face, but I can’t lift my arm. “You’re 
such a boy,” she says.
“What do you mean?” I ask, 
wriggling up against the armrest.
“What are your parents gonna 
say?”
My parents, they’re gonna flip 
out. And suddenly all I want to do 
is leave Leslie and get in a car and 
just drive, away from here, into the 
desert, into Mexico. And when you 
play these things out in your mind, 
it’s like watching a movie in fast for­
ward, and it’s all kind of funny, until 
one time you think about it and you 
realize, holy shit, I’m actually think­
ing aboilt this. Mexico. Mexico. I 
can take her mom’s car and drive to 
Mexico right now.
“Do you wanna stay here 
tonight?” she asks.
“Yeah. I can’t go home, they’ll 
be looking for me.” I look up at her 
and her eyes are intent on me, as if 
waiting for something, and I realize 
what she’s really asking. Now? After 
all that’s happened, she wants to 
screw now?
“Leslie,” I say, “I can’t.”
“Why not? It’s what you were 
coming over here for.”
I don’t know how to tell her 
what I’m feeling. All I know is, 
this seems like the worst possible 
time for us to have sex. “I can’t,” I 
say again.
“Is it me?” she says. “Did I do 
something wrong?”
“It’s not you, it’s not me, it’s 
everything else.”
“I don’t understand.”
I put my head on the armrest, 
which is harder than I expected, and 
I let a little “oh” out when my head 
hits it. My back feels twisted, bent 
out of shape. I squirm. Why is this 
couch so goddamn uncomfortable? 
Leslie takes my hands.
“Leslie, I just—”
“Shh,” she says and pulls me up. 
“Come on, I’ll take you somewhere. 
It’ll calm you down.”
She leads me into the garage. 
We get in her parents’ BMW and 
she backs out of the garage, into the 
street, and drives away from the 
house, into the night.
I say nothing as she drives. I 
lean my head against the window 
and start to doze. I don’t worry 
about her getting into an accident or 
pulled over or anything, ’cause I fig­
ure there’s no way it could happen

twice. Besides, it’s getting late and 
there aren’t many cars on the road. I 
open my eyes to see where we’re 
going. She’s taking Sunset west, 
winding her way up into the 
Palisades, and were passing some 
big houses. Then, just as I’m closing 
my eyes again, I see a head of blond 
hair and I recognize it. I open my 
eyes and look up and down the side­
walk Where is it?
Then I spot him. Standing next 
to a taxi in front of a house. “Stop 
the car,” I say. It’s him. Goddamn, 
it’s himl
“What?” she says. “Why?”
“Just pull over!”
She slows down and moves to 
the curb. I’m out of the car before it 
stops moving. I walk quickly down 
the sidewalk towards the cab. Mr. 
Mercedes is counting bills — I bet 
he has a lot of bills — to pay the 
cabbie. I move fast, anxious and 
angry. “Hey!” I shout.
He looks up. The cab moves 
away. “What the fuck!” he says.
“Got something to say to me?” I 
yell and push him, my hands on his
shoulders, the way he pushed me.
He fumbles backwards, then regains 
his balance and darts for the front 
door of the house. I stand there on 
the sidewalk, shouting after him, 
“Come on, motherfucker! Come and 
get me!” I don’t know what I want 
from him, or why I’m even doing 
this. But I’m angry, I’m so angry, 
and I want him to know it, this big, 
blond, rich prick who thinks he 
owns the world. I bend down and 
stick my hand in the grass and pull 
hard, and I come up with a big 
clump of dirt and grass and I throw 
it at the house. It hits the door and 
falls apart. I reach down into the 
hole I made and dig out a bigger 
clump of dirt. I throw it at a win­
dow. “Come on, asshole!” I yell.
“Goddamn it!” I want to hurt him.
I want to see him be afraid. I 
hate him.
I keep ripping up his lawn and 
throwing bits of dirt at the house, 
and they make thumping sounds 
when they’hit. If I throw enough,
I might make a hole in the house 
and then I could whip the stuff 
right at him.

---------------------------------------------------

Leslie is pulling my arm.
“Come on, before he calls the cops!” 
she shouts, and I know she’s right. I 
don’t want to deal with the cops, but 
I have to make this fucker know 
how I feel, so I kept throwing dirt 
and mud and who knows what else, 
and it falls on me as I throw, in my 
hair, in my eyes.
“Come on” Leslie says, pulling 
hard enough to make me stumble. 
“We’ve gotta go!” She runs back to 
the car, and I follow as fast as I can. 
It’s hard; I’m exhausted and out of 
breath. When I reach the car, she’s 
already in the driver’s seat and she’s 
about to turn it on. “Wait,” I say. 
“Come with me.”
I don’t wait for her, but keep 
moving, running, stumbling really, 
down a sidestreet. Leslie calls from 
behind me. “Just come on!” I shout 
as loud as I can. She must’ve heard 
me — I hear her footsteps.
The street dead-ends and leads 
into a bunch of trees. That’s where I 
want to go. Into those trees.
It’s dark when I get to them.
You can’t see the moon anymore.
You can’t really see where you were 
going. I just want to get away, away 
from the street, away from the noise 
I’d been making on that guy’s lawn.
I stop and put my hand on a tree 
and try to catch my breath. My 
stomach hurts, my head hurts.
Leslie comes up behind me.
“What are we doing here?” she
says.
She’s close to me. Real close.
She puts her hand on my back as I 
start breathing normal again. “Are 
you okay?” she says softly.
I stand up straight and put my 
arms around her and kiss her hard. 
She seems surprised but responds 
quickly. I bring her down to the 
ground, to the dirt, and undo her 
jeans. “I was gonna take you to the 
bluffs,” she says.
“The what?” I ask. Her zipper 
is stuck.
“The bluffs. The cliffs over 
PCH. You can see the whole ocean. 
I thought it would make you feel 
better.”
She’s saying something impor­
tant and I know I’m supposed to lis­
ten and respond, but I don’t hear 
her. Forget it. I get on top of her 
and just like that, we’re doing it, and 
I’m not a virgin anymore. She puts 
her hands around me and squeezes.
I move fast, real fast, and hard, and I 
hear myself panting and feel sweat 
dripping from my armpits. There’s 
no one around, no other sounds, 
nothing else in the world. Soon it’s 
like Leslie isn’t even there, and all I 
know is this feeling, this tightening 
in my groin that spreads through 
the rest of my shuddering body — 
just that one thing.
