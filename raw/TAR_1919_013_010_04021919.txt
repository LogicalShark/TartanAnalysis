!! CYNEMUP !!SCIENCE SMOKER 
A RARE TREAT
Last Friday evening saw the big­
gest Science event of the year, if not 
of many years. In a year in which 
much has occurred to interrupt the 
.growth of school spirit, no mean 
amount of honor is reflected on the 
men who planned and backed the' 
Science Smoker.
The first stunt of the evening was 
pulled off by the Junior Class. A 
shadowgraph of the Willard-Johnson 
fight at Havana, as announced , by 
Paffenbach, was reproduced by mem­
bers of that class.
The Plebes enlivened the evening 
•with their well-known quartet. We 
:are no judge of music, hence we.could 
not speak as to the merits of their 
•song, but, anyway, they got away with 
:Jt.
The Seniors crowned the evening in 
the presentation of their comical 
•satire, which goes without a title. A 
:great deal of time must have been re­
quired in working up this stunt, which 
was a travesty in which the charac­
ters were prominent men about school. 
The audience was moved with com­
passion as it saw an old man, the 
father of one of the Seniors, bruised 
and clothes torn, received while pass­
ing through the military relics only to 
fall over some sort of an incinerator, 
from which he hurried with such 
haste that he fell through the board­
walk into some sort of a tunnel. Or, 
“ ’Breathes there a man with soul so 
•dead' who could not but grieve to see 
a fellow student’s health wrecked by 
wearing sweaty clothes after an in­
discreet dose of P. T.”
It could also be , seen that the 
Seniors had acquired more than tech­
nical learning in the tendency of one 
•character to quote from Henry Clay. 
His impersonation of Dr. Hamer- 
sclilag was unique.
In speaking of time and effort, much 
may be said of the Minstrel Show put 
on by the Sophomores. These men 
were expert entertainers, to say the 
least.
Gladstein was present with his dog 
rose wand, and everyone knows what 
that means.
Also at this smoker the following 
Tau Beta Pi selections were an­
nounced. They are:
W. H. Gillett, 'IS).
J. H. Juergens, '19.
C. D. Mills, ’15).
M. S. Wadsworth, ’19.
H. C. Nordfeldt, ’19.
K. K. Ivnaell, '20.
The music for the evening was fur­
nished by the Sophomores.
The committee :\yas:
F. J. Nuttal 
M. A. Fair 
C. B. Schmidt.
STUDENT SECRETARY VISITS M. M. GIRLS
Miss Richards, the Y. W. C. A. 
student secretary for Pennsylvania, 
Delaware and Maryland, made her 
first real visit to Tech last week 
from Wednesday to Friday. Previous 
-visits have been handicapped by 
“flu” epidemics, peace celebrations 
and final exams. Miss Richards g'oes 
around visiting colleges and acts as 
.¦an adviser to girls, especially offer­
ing suggestions for the upbuilding 
of student Y organizations. All day 
Thursday she was in Mrs. Philputs' 
•office to interview girls and ended 
her visit with a talk at the Y. W. 
meeting Thursday afternoon. It was 
through Miss Richards’ suggestion 
that Booster Week was started in 
Margaret Morrison.
VOCATIONAL TALKS TO M. M. SENIORS
. A series of monthly addresses has 
heen arranged by- Miss Marian 
Holmes, to be given the Senior stu­
dents of the different departments of 
Margaret. Morrison on the vocations 
open to them.
The first of these was held on Fri­
day, March 28, when Miss Lucy M. 
Hartman, former graduate of M. M. 
C. C., gave an interesting talk to the 
Household Economics and Costume 
Senior students, in the Faculty Par­
lors at M. M. C. C. The address con­
cerned vocations open to those stu­
dents.
Tea was served at 3:30, before Miss
WEDDING AT M. M. C. C.
On Monday, at high noon, Mr. 
Chauncey was united in marriage to 
Miss Cleopatra in the Recreation Hall 
of M. M. C. C. The bride wore a 
gown of black alapaca, with touches 
of blue and green in unexpected 
places. Her veil was of real lace 
curtains and was caught on her head 
with a striking bow of pink ribbon. 
The four bridesmen were high ex­
amples of the tailors' art. They 
caused quite a noticeable flutter 
among the female guests. The usli- 
eresses performed their duties, very 
gracefully, especially when a few of 
the guests in the rear became so ex­
cited in their efforts to view the cere­
mony .as to call “Down in front.” They 
were also forced to eject a con­
scientious objector, who violently 
proclaimed her prior claim to the 
groom, when the minister asked for 
objections to the'unipn.
The bridal party entered to the 
strains of “I’ll Say She Does.” The 
musical program was furnished by 
Saint Peter and his Jazz Band, suit­
ably attired as inhabitants of celestial 
regions. With the exception of an 
alarm clock belonging to one of the 
guests, who possibly was afraid of go­
ing to sleep, there were no solos, as 
each of the band seemed bent in out­
doing' the other.
The solemn words of the wedding 
service, beginning with “M. U. F.” and 
ending with “Get ye gone,” were en­
joyed by all in the audience. The 
guests were apparently much im­
pressed by* the solemnity of the cere­
mony.
After the ceremony was ended the 
bridal party and guests assembled i 
and sang. The song with its frequent | 
recurrence of '21 revealed the identity j 
of the actors. The stunt of the | 
Sophomores was very entertaining, 
and the guest that had provided lier- 
selL' with the alarm clock did not need 
it, for the stunt was exciting and 
mirthful enough in itself to keep 
anyone awake.
DEAN BURD’S BROTHER ' PAYS VISIT TO M. M. C. C.
Tuesday, March 25, M. M. C. C. had | 
a most interesting illustrated lecture 
presented to them by Mr. Charles | 
Breed, brother of the Dean of Mar-1 
garet. Morrison. Mr. Breed has trav-- 
eled extensively, spending some .time 
in the Hawaiian Islands. While there 
he made hundreds oL’ photographs of 
the beauties of I,he Paradise of the 
Pacific. These photographs were 
taken by .the luimiere process, and so 
show the exact coloring of the 
scenery. In order to obtain many of 
his unusual pictures a telescopic 
camera had to be used. Upon return­
ing to the United Stales, Mr. Breed 
had his plates copied, so as to present, 
them as stereopticon views.
The lecture .which Mr. Breed pre­
sented to the Margaret Morrison girls 
dealt with Hawaii, and is one he has 
presented in many cities and in many 
large cantonments.
Mr. Breed is head of a boys' school 
in Lawrence, N. .T. ‘
FACULTY GIVEN TEA AT ¦ M. M. C. C. PARLORS
The Public Occasions Committee of 
Margaret Morrison gave a tea for the 
faculty of that school on Tuesday, 
March 25, in the Faculty Parlors. The 
Arts and Crafts Department were in 
charge of the decorations, which were 
unusually effective. The color scheme 
was in pastel, yellow, violet and green 
—spring time colors. A most artistic 
spring table cen.ter-piece,-designed by 
Miss Davidson, was a pot of tulips and 
pussy willows, ornamented with tiny 
kites. Even the candies were artistic, 
being small many-colored balls, repre­
senting marbles, and tied in gauze 
bags. In every way the tea was voted 
a most successful affair, and thanks 
are due to the Public Occasions Com­
mittee, of which Miss Hinman is the 
chairman.
This is the first of a series of teas 
to be given every week by a different 
department for the faculty. Next 
week will be the tea of the Costume 
Economics Department.
NEW COACH TAKES CHARGE OF TRACK CANDIDATES
Athletics of all kinds have taken a 
big boom here lately. The desire for 
better athletics is being shown by 
the student body, and the slogan is 
“get into athletics,’’ A decided in­
crease has been noticed in the track 
squad this past week; every day new 
men are making their appearance on 
the cinder path. Coach Hazel and 
Captain Schmidt have started a whirl 
of propaganda for a better track team. 
New men who have done little or no. 
track work are appearing on the field 
With the real Carnegie spirit, willing 
to help the team. It’s the spirit .that 
counts, and with such a spirit behind 
him the coach has a better chance- of 
developing a winning team. Captain 
Schmidt, the only veteran quarter- 
miler, is rounding into form and shows 
promise of great speed this spring. 
Schmidt is an ideal captain and lead­
er.
Already 30 men have reported to the 
coach and more are appearing every 
day. The bulk of Work at present is 
being put into the preparation of the 
men for the Penn Relays. These will 
be run April 26.
The men who are showing up best 
for this team at present are Captain 
Schmidt, Gare, Hiller, Russell, Arn­
old and Petry. No man’s position is 
assured, and as new material is com­
ing out every day there may be sev­
eral substitutions in this list. Every 
Friday trials 1 are held^ not only for 
the Relays, but for all the track 
events. Swift, Duval and Sack are 
showing up particularly well.
In the hurdles Petry and Arnold, 
two last year’s men, are working hard 
to better the records of the previous 
year. These men are rather under­
size to be first-class hurdlers, but .their 
speed and interest is making up for j 
the lack in height. The coach is' 
spending a great deal of time in'teach­
ing the men to »be judges of pace; he 
has found that none of the men have 
been taught to do this.
PHI EPSILON PI
Plans are already under way for 
the dance, celebrating the third an­
niversary of the Chapter’s Installation 
as Phi Chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi. The 
committee in charge consists of 
Frater I. Levine, chairman; Fraters 
M. Drebin, P. Friedman, M. Gladstein 
and C. Stark.
Lieut. J. C. Levy was in town last 
week. He says he likes the Air Serv­
ice well enough, but prefers flying 
; with one foot on the ground.
CAREY TO LEAD FLOOR TEAM FOR 1919-20
The annual banquet for the mem­
bers ’of the basket ball team was 
held last week In Liu* French Room 
of the Schenley Hotel. Covers were 
laid for eighteen. In addition to the 
members, of the squad Coach Berl. 
Bianchi, and Manager Stupalcoff, 
there were present “Hans” Wagner, 
Supervisor of Athletics at Tech, Dean 
Tarbel, Dean of Men, Dr. Wm. S. 
Marks, who has been acting as di­
rector of athletics, Bert Munhall, 
trainer, Cheerleader Stark and As­
sistant Manager Ye lie.
The banquet marked the closing of 
a very successful basket ball season, 
and was enjoyed by all present. The 
toastmaster for the occasion was Dr. 
W. S. Marks, who introduced the 
following speakers in an interesting 
and pleasing manner: Dean Tar bell,, 
who outlined the steps being taken 
for a brilliant future of all Tech ac­
tivities and athletics; “Honus” Wag­
ner, who instilled more enthusiasm 
into the hearts of the athletes pres­
ent; Coach Bert Bianchi, Captain 
Gretzler, Cheerleader Stark, Manager 
StupakoffTand Homer F. Carey, cap­
tain-elect of next season’s team.
Homer F. (Scoops) Carey, who was 
selected to lead the team next year, 
needs no introduction to the loyal 
supporters of the Tar tap team. The 
big guard played an excellent game 
all season and entered every game 
with the good old fighting spirit, 
sturdy, dependable, 4, reliable
“Scoops” Carey will devote all his 
energy toward a successful season 
for 1919-20. It is the spirit that 
counts in athletics and we hope that 
every man on next year’s squad will 
acquire the “pep" of their captain. I
“Good luck to you, 'Scoops,' we are 
all backing you.”
INTERFRATERNITY DANCE
And Jazz, well I’ll say they ' do. 
School nights don't hold any terror 
for the- fraternities. You should 
have seen them at the interfratern­
ity dance. It is a wonder that the 
school could run on Wednesday morn, 
ing. The dance was a credit to the 
interfraternity council and to the 
committee in charge of which Mi-. 
Gawlhrop was chairman.
Not a more congenial crowd has 
been assembled in the Union this 
year. Even that inevitable flickering 
of lights at about the third dance 
( from the end was eliminated and the 
crowd danced merrily on until about 
i two.
Have you signed up for the INTER­
CLASS MEET yet?
Eventually, why not now?
You can’t run? Ever get chased out 
of an orchard by a dawg? Ever jump 
a fence? Or a creek?
If not, you sure have run for ad­
vantageous , mess positions in the 
been’ry.
Or an office.
C’mout—if you can’t run, hop, jump 
or fly; show us—we’re from Mis­
souri.
P. S.—Sign up by Friday, there’ll be 
a. sheet in every school; write on all 
sides and the edges, too, if neces­
sary.
CLUBSTREATWILMERDING 
TO SEASON’S DEST SHOW
The Musical Clubs presented the 
most successful concert of the season 
last Thursday evening in the auditor­
ium of the Wilmerding Y. M. C. A. 
A special car left Woodlawn avenue 
at 7 o’clock, carrying 70 members of 
the clubs, the largest number which 
has ever participated in a single con­
cert. The great success of the con­
cert was due, in part, to the fact that 
Mr. Crawford anfl Signor Scalzo, the 
directors of both clubs, were present. 
It was the first concert this season in 
which Signor Scalzo has conducted 
the Mandolin Club, his many duties in 
the city having kept him from ac­
companying the club on previous con­
certs. During the course of the pro­
gram, Signor Scalzo, accompanied by 
George Ellerton on the guitar, played 
a mandolin solo, which “brought down 
the house.” After the concert, the 
clubs were treated to a “feed,” in 
the Y. M. C. A. dining room, at. which 
several hundred home-made dough­
nuts were ruthlessly destroyed.
Mr. Fisk, the secretary of the Y. M. 
C. A., was immensely pleased with the 
concert. That,the audience was satis­
fied was shown by their appreciation 
of the many numbers. Mr. Fisk lias 
requested the Musical Clubs to give 
another concert tills season at Wll- 
merding. This is the first time that 
the clubs have been asked to. reap-: 
pear in a city during the same season, 
and speaks well for the quality of the 
concert. •
Plans are under way for the Home 
Conccrt, which will be given on May 9, 
in Carnegie Music Hall. Having had 
such success already, If Is certain that 
fhe I-Iome Concert will bo the host 
one ever given. Plans are being for­
mulated Cor a formal dunce, after the 
Home Concert. This will be •the 
fourteenth annual I Ionic .Concerl of 
the Carnegie Musical Clubs and, from 
lho size of the clubs this season and 
the quality of the entertainment which 
Is presented, this year’s concert will 
far surpass any other.
Y. W. C. A. MAKES SCRAP BOOKS
After brief opening exercises, the 
regular Y. W. 0. A. meeting was 
turned into a scrapping party. While 
Miss Richards talked, some of the 
girls cut up and some pasted atfrar 
tive pictures from a variety of maga­
zines oil flexible cardboard. Mary 
Young saw fo it that everyone who 
dropped in was supplied with a pair 
of scissors or a pot of paste. The 
ten finished loose-leafed scrap books 
tied with different colored raffia will 
make a pleasing gift to the little in­
valids and cripples in the Children’s 
Hospital. .
You - can’t afford to miss thi.- 
weelc's meeting. Dr. Hugh Thomp­
son Kerr, pastor of the Sliadyside 
Presbyterian Church, will give an 
Easter talk and there will be special 
music.
The contemplated program for next 
quarter is as follows:
April 24—Miss Ooiooah Burner, Na­
tional Secretary for Colleges, will

R.O. T.C. PLANS ACCEPTED IN FULL DY FACULTY
The plans submitted by the Mili­
tary Department, for Tech’s R. O. T. 
C. were practically accepted in full by 
ihe faculty at a recent meeting. Those 
plans, which will go into effect soon, 
have been very carefully drawn up. 
and the most thoughtful consideration 
has been given to the relationship be­
tween military work, college scholar­
ship and school activities. The new 
schedule of military work, which will 
not include preliminary infantry drill, 
has been made as light as possible, 
so as to in no way interfere with a 
student’s work. At. present the total 
hours of military work will consist of 
two hours a week lectures. Field 
work will not start until the equip­
ment in the various branches arrives.
At a general assembly, which will 
be held next week, the advantages and 
course of study in each group will be 
explained.

gym for the class of 1920. The cheer­
ing and singing of all classes added 
Interest to the game. The audience 
comfortably filled the gym, and each 
class tried to outdo the others I11 the 
cheering.
Marian Batchellor deserves a great 
share of the credit for her remarkable 
work in- netting 24 bnsketfl. Follow­

was enjoyed between halves.

FIFTH LIBERTY LOAN
Do you know what is to be clone with the money subscribed to 
the Fifth Liberty Loan'/ A large percentage of it is to be used for 
the rehabilitation of wounded men. Under the jurisdiction of the 
proper military or naval authorities, the Government of the United 
»States is resolved to use all the medical and surgical treatment neces­
sary to restore every American soldier to health and strength.
Then the Federal Board for Vocational Education will consider 
his future. If through his disablement, he is unable to take up the 
work lie le,ft to go into the country’s service, a large vocational field 
is opened to him with a wide choice of occupations. He is carefully 
trained along a certain line, to self-supporting activity.
Artificial limbs will bó provided for by the Government free 
ol! charge, kept in repair and renewed if necessary. If after being 
discharged from a hospital, a soldier needs further medical treatment, 
the Government will supply it free. While in the hospital and while 
in training afterwards, the soldier or sailor will receive compensa­
tion and his dependents will receive their allotments.
Any soldier, desiring to do so, may take a course' in vocational 
training, free of cost and, during the period of training, the war risk 
insurance compensation will be paid him.
The first three loans launched America in the Avar; the Fourth 
Liberty Loan made overwhelming victory Tor the Allies possible; 
the Fifth Liberty Loan has as great a. purpose: the country instead 
of being filled with dependent beggars and cripples, a constant re­
minder of the horrible side of war, will have thousands of trained 
men—-heroes, the glory of whose sacrifice will not be blackened by 
a mental and moral disintegration.
The fight for existence is hard at best and the battle-scarred 
soldier, crippled and maimed, depending on us, would soon be at the 
mercy ol! society. The passion of pub lie sentiment will soon die 
away; immorality and dishonesty will then beckon him, and he is 
welcomed into a life of sin. lie becomes n menace lo society, a crim­
inal nt, large, a person whose absence would benefit all.
Place yourself l'or a moment in Ilio place of the discharged sol­
dier. LI! you were unt|rained, il* no work could be secured, il' you had 
$5.00 between you and starvation, I ask you, “what would you doV”
Today as we enjoy the pleasures ol: life and freedom, there are 
many soldiers, tired and worn by the trials and privations of weary 
days in Krance, about to face the game again alone. And better 
far lo him, than to tread the flowery paths, strewn with flowers of 
temporary passions of hero worship, is to step into the world again 
a free man with a vocation, a few dollars l4o go on, and an even 
chance with the man who stayed at home.
To accomplish this, is the noble prerogative of the Fifth Liberty 
Loan. Is it not worthy of your support? Show your gratitude to the 
American soldier for a work well done and subscribe to the Fifth 
Liberty Loan.
WHAT IS A JOKE?
The policy of the Tartan has been to put into the Bolsheviki any 
contribution that students may hand in. However this will have to 
be limited unless more care is exercised in selecting what may be 
called a joke. The reference in last week’s issue, to the “Design 
Undressed Ball,” was very crude indeed—clear out of place. Had 
the editor noticed it while in makeup, it would have been “knifed.” 
In handing in contributions to this column, the party who su­
pervises it wishes to state any and all “clean” wit is wanted, but 
that which refleets discredit on any school is “taboo.”

the Pittsburgh Railways by dropping three or four pennies into the 
fare box instead of seven. This procedure may look cute and seem 
quite funny but after all it is no joke. True, the street car service 
is such that it would give any one grounds to try to beat the com­
pany, but does cheating the conductor in any way beat the railroad? 
By no means—every time a cash fare is dropped in the box, it is reg­
istered by the conductor, and every night the cash fares are read 
from the register tapes, totaled and the conductors are the ones that 
make up the shortage, should one occur. Be a man of Tech, a gen­
tleman—not a man from Tech.

85,000 Helmets---$1.00
One of the Yanks and Lewis B. F ranklin, director of the War Loan Or- 
ganization at Washington, looking over the German helmets on the steps 
if the Treasury Building.H
OW much would you give 
for a German helmet— 
a nice patent-leather 
covered helmet all 
dolled up for the use of some mis­
guided Hun who expected to wear 
it into Paris when the Crown 
Prince’s forces were to make their 
triumphal entry into 'the French 
capital?
The United States Treasury has. 
just purchased S5.000 of them for 
one dollar. That means the whole 
85,000 for the one, lone dollar— 
not a dollar a piece.
The helmets were found in a
storehouse at Coblenz when the 
Army of Occupation arrived. The 
Treasury Department asked the 
War Department for them for use 
as awards in the Victory Liberty 
Loan campaign and to make the 
transfer conform to regulations a 
purchase had to be made. The dol­
lar did the trick.
The festive German headgear is 
to be 'distributed among salesmen 
and saleswomen who make records 
in the drive beginning April 21 and 
to school children over the coun­
try who write the hest Victory 
Loan essays.
Winter Reading.
Books of natural history make -the 
most cheerful winter reading. 1 read 
In Audubon with a thrill of delight, 
when the snow covers the ground, oJ 
the magnolia, and the Florida keys, 
and their warm sea breezes; of the 
fence rail, and the cotton tree, and the j 
migrations ol’ the rice bird; of the j 
breaking up of winter in Labrador
and the melting o!' the snow on the | 
forks of the Missouri.—Thoreau.
Passed Up Tempting Offer.
William Ewart Gladstone, the great 
statesman, refused tens of thousands 
of pounds offered to him for articles 
by publishers. It is said that an Amer­
ican magazine proprietor once sent him 
a'blank, clieek and told him to iill it 
up for any amount lie pleased so lone 
as he sent him 2,000 words for his mag­
azine. Mr. Gladstone returned the 
letter and the check also as blank ns 
It arrived.

the necessity of sitting down while

Ancient Needlework.

work of queens like Matiida and noble 
ladies in olden times was largely 
needlework.

Browning's High Ideals.
Probably the writer who most fre­
quently refused money was Bobert 
Browning the poet. During the last 
25 years of his life editors offered 
large sums for a short poem from his 
pen. But Browning said “No.” He 
told his friends when they pointed out 
the unwisdom of this course that he 
was determined not to thrust his po­
ems down the throats of the people; 
that if they wanted to read them they 
could buy his books.
Paths of Democracy.
To accustom oneself to disregard 
the accidents of manner and station 
sufficiently tosee the man as he Is, to 
have a clear; sight for genuine charac­
ter under any of the disguises of un- 
ffimlllarlty and prejudice, to know,how 
slihple and how common are the ele­
ments that go to the making of man­
hood, are the paths that lead to belief 
in democracy.—George E. Woodberry.
Long Day and Night.
The north pole has six months day 
and six months night, the sun appa­
rently traveling In a circle around It 
from the time It appears In March un­
til It disappears in September.
Law of Life.
A thought, good or evil y ail* net, in 
time a habit, so runs life’s law; what 
you live in your thought world, that, 
.sooner or later, you will find objecti­
fied In your life.—Ralph Waldo Trine.
To Whiten Wax.
The wax should be boiled in water, 
spread out into thin layers and then 
exposed to the light and air. Repeat 
this process until all the color Is gone, 
and the wax will remain pure and 
white.
Friendship S.’.ows Worth.

the best measures of his worth.—Anne

Dear Reader: (I flatter myself to
that extent)—I spent two weeks and 
three hours thinking up something to 
say about those poor abused ' army 
lieutenants. Now, don’t criticise me. 
I know I could have spent the time 
to better advantage, but the fruits of 
my labor sure were ripe and luscious 
—and then—our editor would not let 
us publish it. Isn’t that enough to 
make a poor “woiking” girl take a 
nice, sweet drink of carbolic acid?
Confidentially, the Soph Hop is go­
ing to be the best dance ever given 
in the Union.
The lieutenants stationed at Tech 
in charge of Uncle Sam’s Indoor 
Army have been discharged. Now 
for the triumphal return to their own

issue of The Tartan a note about 
Major Holland having a soft job is

A bill of several splendid features 
at the New Million Dollar Grand, .ill 
next wedlc starting Monday morning, 
April 7, will be headed by Anita 
Stewart’« latest photo drama, "A 
Midnight Romance,” a spectacular 
production of mystery, love and In­
trigue. Based upon an engrossing 
story from the pen of Marlon Orth, 
and made under the personal super­
vision of Lois Weber, the picture 
permits Miss Stewart’s excellent dis­
play of her acting skill, her beauty, 
her whimsical personality and her 
ability to wear line costumes. She 
is supported by -an excellent com­
pany, every member of it giving line 
portrayal of the characters repre­
sented.
DAVIS THEATER
Beware of Compromises.
One temptation In making difficult 
decisions is to compromise. You aren’t 
sure which way is the best, you seek 
to combine tile advantages of both, and 
many a time merely combine all the 
disadvantages. To be sure, there are 
times when a compromise Is the wisest 
course, but there are just as many 
times when it Is cowardice and weak­
ness. How can one tell which times 
are which? Well, that is simply an­
other decision for you.
If your fountain pen is in need of 
repairs, if you need a new, satisfactory 
pen or eversharp pencil, stationery, 
dance programs, fkvors, special felt 
goods or Tech recognition pins, call 
at SINGER PEN & GIFT SHOP in 
Jenkins Arcade.—Adv.
The Davis theater will entertain 
seekers after enlivening recreation 
next week, beginning Monday after­
noon, April 7, with a program of 
nine Keith vaudeville acts in which 
there are four notable headline at­
tractions. Sallie Fisher, erstwhile 
star of musical comedy, who sue-j 
ceeded Fay Templeton in the role 
of Mary in George C. Cohan's “Forty- 
live Minutes from Broadway,” and 
was in the all-star cast ot' “Watch

edy drama of New York prudery.

SCHOOL NOTES
Miss Merrill, head of the Depart­
ment of Arts and Crafts of M. M. C. 
C., gave a most delightful tea Thurs­
day afternoon, at her home on Howe 
street. The guests were the girls in 
Miss Merrill’s department. Tea, 
sandwiches, nuts and candy were en­
joyed. Great regret was expressed 
when Miss Merrill announced that ,she 
would not be at school next quarter. 
Her doctor has ordered her to take a 
rest, which she has decided to do, 
though most unwillingly; Miss Mer­
rill made the afternoon one the girls 
will long remember.
Thursday at 3:30 the Secretarial 
Department of M. M. attended a most 
interesting lecture in the .Industry 
School. The lecture was by Mr. Far­
ley of the National Cash Register 
Company, and was on the “Troubles 
of a Merchant and How To Stop 
Tliein.” Motion pictures were used to 
illustrate the most important points 
of the lecture; several interesting 
plans for store organization were 
shown.
Miss Ginetle Le Cl ere was given a 
baby party by I ho girls of Mellon An­
nex. Costumes, eats and hours were 
nil strikingly original, and everyone 
had an hilarious, time.
Miss Mary Ride Lees, of Cleveland, 
Class 1.1)10, visited M. M, on Thursday. 
She had been Student Government 
President while at Margaret Morri­
son.
ATHLETIC NOTES
The Intor-scholastlc Track Moot, 
which Is to b« held on May 31 at the 
Schenley Oval, promises lo be one of 
the largest moots ever’ arranged by 
"Tech." A great deal more enthus­
iasm Is being put Into the meet Mils 
year, on account of the great, wave of 
athletic Interest developed by the war. 
Manager Little has sent out Invita­
tions lo all I he leading high schools 
and "prep” schools of Pennsylvania, 
Ohio, West Virginia and Western New 
York.
Gold, silver and bronze medals will 
be given to those who are first, second 
and third in all events. A beautiful 
loving cup will be presented to the 
school winning the greatest number 
of points. From early information re­
ceived by Manager Little, it is cer­
tain that more schools will be repre­
sented this year than ever before.
The authorities are making exten­
sive arrangements for the care and en­
tertainment of the contesting teams. 
Trains will be met by representatives 
from here who will take charge of the 
teams as they arrive. After the meet 
there will be a mass meeting in the 
Union Club Room, at which time the 
medals will be given to the respective 
winners. Following this meeting, 
speeches will be made by Coach Wag­
ner and Coach Hazel and coaches of 
the visiting teams.
The snappy baseball team is playing 
fast ball for so early'in the season. 
The team is composed mostly of 
youngsters, who are all ears to the 
coaching of Wagner. It is doubtful if 
a Carnegie baseball team of the past 
has ever displayed such a knowledge 
of inside baseball so early in the sea­
son as Ibis team of youngsters.
Work on the physical education side

One of the features of the coming

in part, pay the cost of saving the 
lives of more than 500,000 Yanks and 
thousands of our allies, according to 
Lewis B. Franklin, Director of the U. 
S. War Loan Organization.

did the men at German general head­
quarters,” states Mr. Franklin, ‘.‘but 
the fact that America was preparing 
for a drive on Berlin struck terror to 
the general staff.
“And those millions and billions of 
dollars spent were far from • being 
wasted in an unnecessary preparation. 
I feel that the fact that honey was 
spent and that an enormous output of 
munitions was ready was the control­
ling factor in the weakening of the 
German general staff, and that it caus­
ed their message to the kaiser that 
they were beaten and that he must 
sue for peace. And the way I see it 
is that this money, instead of being 
wasted, can be v-ritfcen down as hav­
ing saved the lives of hundred of 
thousands of American men who 
would have been sacrificed had the 
war continued another year.
"That is the money we are going 
to ask the American people for in the 
Liberty Loan., Wo are going to ask 
them for the money to bring our boys 
home safe and sound, instead of leav­
ing them buried in France. And 
when the people of America realize 
what this money did, we are not go­
ing to find that they are lacking in 
patriotism to ‘come across.’ ”
