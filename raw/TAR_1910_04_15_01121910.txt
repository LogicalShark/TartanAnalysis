MR. ADVERTISER
Do you really know the advertising 
value of a school paper? Do you 
realize ,that Carnegie Tech is the larg­
est technical school in the United 
States—not going to be any more, but 
IS? Do you realize that 2500 students 
are enrolled here—enough to make a 
good sized town with no children or 
old people? Do you know that The 
Tartan is its only student paper and 
appears 36 times during the school 
year? Now, Mr. Advertiser, don’t you 
think it would pay to let these young 
money spenders (three-fourths are 
men) know what you have to sell? For

THIS YEAR’S PROGRESS
GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUBS
SEASON 1909-1910
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs’ season of 1909-1910 
has thus far been highly satisfactory, both to the 
Official Board and to the members of the clubs. .
Both clubs started the year with the proper dash 
and spirit that makes for a successful season. The 
clubs, under competent leaders, have made wonderful 
progress, considering the few weeks they have been 
rehearsing, and right here we might state that it is 
the individual unit that makes our clubs what they 
are, in that every man has felt it his privilege and 
duty to give his best efforts, even at a personal 
sacrifice of valuable time.
At the beginning of the season it was apparent 
to the Official Board that, to put the clubs on a more 
permanent basis, radical changes must be made. 
After everal meetings of the Board they finally 
drafted a constitution and by-laws, simple but ef­
fective in character. It was not the intention of the 
officers to make a long-drawn-out, red-tape affair, 
but a few simple words that would constitute an or­
ganization. This document was presented to the 
members of the clubs at the smoker held at the 
University Club, December 19th, 1909, for their ap­
proval or disapproval. The Contsitution was unani­
mously adopted. This is the first time that the Car­
negie Tech Glee and Mandolin Clubs can be recog­
nized as an organization of the Carnegie Technical 
Schools.
The officers at the beginning of the year decided 
that they would do all in their power to give the 
members of the clubs all the pleasure and enjoy­
ment they could derive from trips, concerts and en­
tertainments of different kinds. It was decided to 
arrange a trip during the Christmas recess. Con­
certs were given in South Sharon, Mercer and 
Grove City that would be a credit to any organiza­
tion of longer standing than the Carnegie Tech Glee 
and Mandolin Clubs. Our concerts were well re­
ceived at every town at which a concert was given, 
and the school can be justly proud of the gentle­
manly conduct of its students while on this trip. 
The management has under consideration several 
more out-of-town trips after the annual concert on 
January 19th. Strenuous efforts are being put forth 
to make the concert this year better than we have 
ever had in the past, both musically and financially.

THE TARTAN
ALL OUT FOR THE CONCERT
The members of the Clubs will do all in their power 
to make it a success, and will depend on the stu­
dent body to do their part in the way of securing 
a crowded house.
The Official Board is fortunate in having the 
hearty co-operation of the Student Activities Com­
mittee, of which Mr. Wm. P. Field is Chairman. 
Mr. Field and the management have worked hand- 
in-hand, and the officers of the Clubs are under 
many obligations to the Committee for advice and 
financial assistance rendered. This Committee made 
it possible for the Mandolin Club to purchase in­
struments, which were much needed to round out 
the intsrumentation of the Club. These are the 
property of the Mandolin Club, subject to the con­
trol of the Students Committee.
It is the desire of the Official Board that har­
mony shall prevail throughout the organization, and 
that personal matters or wishes shall'be subservi­
ent to the best interests of the Clubs.
HARRY F. GUMP, President.
FROM THE MANAGER.
There is every reason why the students of C. T. 
S. should support their Glee and Mandolin Clubs in 
their annual concert. In previous years the support 
of the students has been very meager.
Our Clubs have been placed on a very high 
standard for an institution less than five years old. 
In fact, our progress has been so remarkable that our 
reputation extends far beyond the limits of Western 
Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia,
Heretofore these Clubs have been better support­
ed by the citizens of Pittsburgh than our student 
body. If they merit this support, why not the sup­
port of every student of these schools, who have 
every reason to be proud of our Clubs? At the con­
cert last year the society men and womtn of Pitts­
burgh displayed their interest by attending in large 
numbers. There were 900 people at the concert, of 
this number less than 250 were students of this 
school. This year it is expected to have at least
1,000 of our own men and women there. The man­
agement of the Clubs is giving every inducement to

the students to attend; reduced rates to students, 
which has never been done before, and an extended 
sale of reserved seats at the store room, starting on 
Wednesday morning, January 12th, at 9 o’clock, 
and lasting until Saturday noon.
The standard of the Clubs is far better than 
ever before. The Glee Club is able to compel those 
of the large Eastern institutions to sit up and take 
notice, while the Mandolin Club has made such re­
markable progress that at Christmas time they 
were in better shape than at the end of last season. 
Come out and hear the Clubs play and sing. You 
will leave feeling happy, and that the evening was 
well spent. You will also be proud of your Alma 
Mater.
W. H. KING, Jr., Manager.
GLEE CLUB PROGRAM.
From the opening number, “The War Song of 
the Dare Alls,” to the last rousing cheer, the new pro­
gram of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs’ Concert, to be 
given next Wednesday evening at Carnegie Music 
Hall, is a delightful sequence of stirring songs and 
catchy music, mingled with the soft and langorous 
tones of the Mandolin Club’s “Heart Murmurs,” and 
the quartette’s classic “Brown’s Lullaby.” The boys 
are in the finest possible shape as a result of their 
strenuous practice, and expert critics who have been 
called to hear the Clubs say that they will be able 
to give the best concert in the history of the Schools.
The humorous side of college life is well repre­
sented by such songs as “The Bonnie Owl,” “Quite 
a Frost We Had Last Night,” “Daisies Won’t Tell,” 
and “Catastrophe.” A special point is made by the 
Tech Glee Club, under Mr. Lunt’s direction, to have 
every word of every song perfectly clear and dis­
tinct, in addition to giving a correct rendering of the 
accompanying music. Mr. Lunt, the new director, 
has hit a very important point in this case, one that 
is frequently neglected by the ordinary college mu­
sicians.
The Glee Club shows itself master of the pure 
and rounded tones necessary for the rendition of 
such numbers as “A Winter Song,” “Don’t You Cry, 
Ma Honey,” “Marietta” and “Da Coppah Moon.” 
The latter is an especially fine example of the high­
est type of Southern music, and it loses none of its 
charm in its rendition.
The Mandolin Club, greatly augumented by new 
instruments, such as mandolas, banjo mandolins and 
banjeurines, has some numbers in store which are 
wonderfully vivid and full of that contagious spirit 
which is characteristic of the best American college 
music. It is said that Chief of Police McQuaide be­
lieves it will be necessary to have a squad of “stal­
warts” on duty to prevent the enthusiastic audience 
from arising in a body and performing the Highland 
Fling or some other undignified expression of the 
quickened pulse inspired by the Mandolin Club num­
bers. However that may be, it is certain that every 
one, and every one’s girl will have a fine time. Join 
the bunch!
HISTORY OF THE GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUBS.
The Tech Glee and Mandolin Clubs were called 
into being by a great need—not a go-as-you-please 
desirability—but a snortling, screaming necessity, 
which ran down the corridors of our new buildings 
seizing all comers by the back of the neck und 
screaming, “The Athletic Association needs more 
money.” For then, as now, coin of the realm was 
scarce in the camp of the athletes and money was 
needed to finance the coming schedules. It was the 
middle of January of that first disturbed year of the 
Schools’ foundation, when Tech was striving for 
recognition in collegiate athletics, and was un­
known to most people and considered on a par with 
the Botany School by other outsiders. It was de­
cided to give a Glee and Mandolin Club concert. 
When inquiry was made as to available dates for 
renting the Music Hall, it was found that the only 
date open within the next three months was Febru­
ary first, only two weeks ahead. Such little matters 
were not allowed to interfere with the determina­
tion to give a concert in such a cause, and the date 
was accepted. The only thyig needed then was to 
find the Glee and Mandolin Clubs.
Previous to this time the Glee Club had had a 
few rehearsals under Mr. Dorrington, with a view 
to possibly giving a concert sometime in the very 
distant future. The Mandolin Club was simply a 
bunch of fellows who spent what little spare time 
they had in “tickling the ding-hats.” But in the 
two weeks that followed every member of both Clubs 
showed a spirit of which Tech should be proud, and 
which has been a binding tradition in our musical 
clubs ever since. Bob Parsons, Taxis, Summers, 
and twenty others equally sincere “achieved the im­
possible” and prepared the two clubs for a full con­
cert in two weeks time. With two rehearsals every 
day, music to memorize at meal times, and a con­
stant flood of details to be arranged, each day was 
made to serve as a week, and sleep was banished. 
The Mandolin Club found it necessary to have their 
sore and tender finger tips specially treated and 
manicured, while the Glee Club tried every known 
cure for hoarseness except rest.
With the eventful evening came a crowded 
house and a success that netted the Athletic Asso­
ciation several hundred dollars after paying the 
bare expenses of the musicians. Many people who 
came to that first concert merely in charity to the 
athletic interests discovered that they had received 
more than their money's worth in entertainment.
The Mucical Clubs have grown some since then. 
Four years of effort and experience has removed all 
the rough places and given Tech an organization of

which she may justly feel proud. After the first 
concert the men were quick to organize into a 
strong, combined club, and progress has been rapid 
ever since. Under John Taxis, as president, the 
concert the following year was given successfully, 
and the music rendered reflected great credit upon 
the musical directors, Mr. Dorrington and Mr. 
Scheidlmeier. The president and musical directors 
held their positions for the first four years, and it is 
largely due to their strict regard for musical ability, 
regardless of favoritism, that the Clubs have been 
able to show such a fine record.
During the following years brilliant concerts 
have been given, not only at Carnegie Hall, but at 
Edgewood, Bellevue, Greensburg, Knoxville, Chester, 
W. Va., Homestead, Duquesne, P. C. W., and numer­
ous informal appearances. The record of the Clubs 
has been a proud one throughout the existence of 
Tech. No other student organization has been more 
universally successful and no other has done more 
to increase the good name of Tech. The men de­
serve YOUR support, a very easy thing to give when 
you consider that it is not a give-away or a two- 
year loan, but a purchase for which you receive full 
value in retun
MICHAEL J. SCHIEDLMEIER.
There is a rumor over on the South Side hills 
that the man who is now in charge of the Tech Man­
dolin Club, Mr. Michael J. Scheidlmeier, was born 
with a thumb-pick in his hand ready for playing, and 
with the words “Someone’s out of time—let me fix 
it,” on his lips. Certain it is, however, that he com­
menced to make sweet music at an early age and 
has learned all the tricks of his trade. His skill has 
brought him an extensive practice as a teacher of 
stringed instruments ¡and as a concert soloist 
throughout the Eastern States. He has been the 
leader of the Tech instrumentalists for four seasons, 
and has been one of the chief factors in the success 
they have achieved. His popularity as one of the 
fellows has enabled him to lead them with perfect 
control.

ONE FOR THE GAME’S FINE POINTS.
“The more I see of life,” remarked the ex-Leaguer 
reminiscently, “the more I find that the plays I 
learned in baseball hold good in any company.”

play did you use the other night when you proposed 
to Miss Yellorocks?”

THE AREO CLUB.
All hail the advent of the aeroplane in the ac­
tivities of student life at Carnegie Tech! Let Jan­
uary 8 be marked in red letters on the calendar, 
for on that date I. A. Slirgerland, of the Upper Class 
in Electric Wiring, A. & J. School, launched to suc­
cessful flight the first of what we trust shall soon 
be a numerous fleet of aerial craft. The machine
wa a bi-plane, and the trial took place over a
course laid out in the Pattern ,Shop. It was made 
in the presence of a large and enthusiastic audi­
ence, among whom were noted Messrs. Dodds, New- 
house, Smith, Connell, Wood, Bauman and Calder- 
wood. Clambering to the dizzy heights of the 
shafting gallery, the inventor and constructor busied 
fain^elf with preparations for the supreme mo­
ment which should crown him with the laurels of 
victory, or rudely shatter both his hopes and his 
beloved airship. The machine was carefully ele­
vated to a position, the intrepid aeronaut assumed 
an Ajax-defying-the-lightning pose, the spectators 
waited with the regulation hushed expectation 
while, to the prophetic strains of “Down, Down, 
Down Where the Wurzberger Flows,” played by the 
Pattern Shop Trio, the band-saw, rip-saw and planer, 
the first Carnegie Tech airship began its flight. On 
it glided like a bird on wing, the wildly cheering 
crowd rushing after, until, at a distance of full sixty 
feet from the starting point the bi-plane gracefully 
fettled to the floor-plane, and the initial flight was 
ended. Carefully it was picked up and conveyed
to the starting point, and the flight was repeated,
and again, and again, until, after a longer and more 
eractic passage than usual, the craft and Connell 
landed on the floor together with wood on top. 
There was a hoarse bellow of rage from the plane, 
a shriek of agony from, the ripper, a resounding 
crackling of wood (?) and rending of cloth, and 
another page was added to history.
“Merely a change in the form of matter,” phil­
osophically observed the hero of the occasion, as he 
gathered up the fragments and put thm in his 
pocket for, we may here pause to observe, that the 
contraption was but a model about two feet in 
length, also that the discreet designer and builder, 
having no desire to reach the Happy Hunting 
Grounds by the Darius Green Air Line, did not ac­
company his flying machine on it voyages. There 
were no also-flews as the event had not been adver­
tised, which is to be regretted as there are said to 
be a number of high-fliers about the schools.
Seriously speaking, the subject of aeronautics 
is receiving the earnest attention of a goodly num­
ber of the scientifically inclined students of the 
three schools. The Aero Club is thoroughly alive, 
and it is worthy of remark that while this initial 
trial was in progress two other amateurs, Wood and 
Bauman, were busily engaged in the Pattern Shop 
in the construction of other models, and, although 
Slingerland beat them to it, none were more hearty 
in congratulation than they.

---------------------------------------------------

A public exhibition and try-out of models, to 
which entries are invited, is scheduled for a date 
within the next fortnight and it is the intention of 
the members to unite in the construction of a prac­
tical man-carrier to be completed before the end of 
April.
Come to the next regular meeting, Friday after­
noon, the 7th inst., at 4:00 P. M., in the Assembly 
Hall, A. &. J. Building.
TECH AND PITT TIE IN ROUGH GAME.
FINAL SCORE 1 to 1.
In a very rough game Tech and Pitt played a 
tie, the final score being 1 to 1. The game was un­
usually rough, and most of the players had a little 
ticket somewhere about them to show that they 
haa been there. The game was otherwise fast. II 
was a battle for first place, and both teams went at 
it hammer and tongs from the start. Gilt edge 
work by the two goal tenders, Minnemeyer and 
Reed, alone, holding the score to such small figures. 
Over 1,000 attended the game and, to quote from a 
Pittsburgh paper, the yells hurled across the ice 
gjave the event a gridiron tinge.
Taken as a whole there was very little team 
work. Both of the goals were scores won. by the 
result of the work of individuals. Pitt rather took 
the people by surprise by their speed during the 
early part of the game. It was a very much super­
ior game to the one that they played against State 
last week.
During the first half three of the players were 
hurt. Haggerty received a bad cut over the eye by 
one of his own men, who accidentally brought his 
stick back. Bright tried to hit the puck between his 
teeth, and, as a result, has a badly cut lip. He was 
also hit with a stick on the head. Muller had his 
wind knocked out of him, and was carried from the 
ice. There was no scoring in the first half, al­
though many shots were made.
After 12 minutes of play in the second half 
Lambing carried the puck up the ice and directly 
in front of Tech’s goal. Here he evaded Captain 
Bornberger and shot past Minnemeyer. As the 
game progressed it looked as though Pitt would win 
by this one point. However, with just one minute to 
play, Mason shot Tech’s only goal. This tied the 
game and ended the scoring.
Dornberger played a strong game for Tech. He 
was strong on the defense and time after time car­
ried the puck up the ice. Bright, Charles and Mason 
played their usual fast game. For Pitt Boyle, Lamb­
ing and Haggerty starred.
As it was too late to play the tie off, it will 
be played off during the week. The line-up:

WHITE FRIARS CALL FOR CANDIDATES.
Trials for the 1910 Show to be Held Week of Jan- 
urary 24th.
The management of the White Friars has de­
cided upon the week of January 24th as the time 
to hold the trials for the annual show.
It is expected that the week will be used in try­
ing out the men and the making up of the squad. 
Last year fully 125 men came out for the places, 
and it is hoped that that number will be more than 
equalled this year. It really does not matter wheth­
er a man has had any experience or not, as is well 
shown by the number of new men that are used 
each year. The management also announces that 
the size of the choruses will be increased, thus 
giving more places to try for. All rrien who desire 
to have a try are asked to get a blank to fill out 
from Manager Mitchell or Mr. Wood in Mr. Field’s 
office. All persons desiring to enter the competi­
tion must fill this blank out in order to get a trial. 
'This ruling applies to those trying for the cast as 
well as the choruses. The exact time and place of 
the trials will be announced in next weeks Tartan.
Two assistant business managers are wanted. 
All those who would like to try for the places are 
requested to have a talk with Manager Mitchell as 
soon as possible. The place affords a lot of good 
experience, and is well worth while to those who 
get it. It will also insure the taking of the trip 
Easter week..
While it is rather early in the game for any 
definite plans to be matured a successful season 
is looked forward to. The shows have improved 
¦each year, and it is to be hoped that this order of 
things will continue. Last year the show was a 
decided success from the artistic standpoint, and 
all those who saw it enjoyed it.
If any Tech man has any dramatic tendencies 
let him come out and show them.
At the University of Chicago representatives of the 
fraternities met to consider methods to bring about 
cleaner campus politics.
The Illinois rooters went wild over their narrow 
victory over Indiana, and stormed the theatres, de­
manding fr^e shows.

EDITORIAL
A TRYING SITUATION.
We expressed the hope in this column last week, 
of being able to give some of the figures of the re­
port on the condition of our athletic affairs to be 
made by Dr. Savage, the new Athletic Director. At 
the present writing it is impossible for us to get 
anything definite as he has not as yet been able to 
sift the matter to the bottom. Our only course is 
to wait. In the meantime, the managers of the base­
ball and foot-ball teams' tell us, that they cannot 
hold their schedules without signing up the con­
tracts before the fifteenth -of the month. It is only 
this that makes the necessity of waiting hard to 
bear. In case things can be so arranged as to have 
some kind of representation in the way of thletics 
during the coming year, the impossibility of secur­
ing a schedule at a late date looms up .as a spectre 
announcing Tech’s withdrawal from the intercol­
legiate field for the present. It is at best a difficult 
and trying situation; clearly one of those times when 
to patiently wait what can best be done by those in 
authority, is a great aid to a speedier solution of the 
problem.
DIRECTOR HAMERSCHLAG IN NEW YORK.

Since this issue is largely devoted to the in­
terests of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs, it might be 
well for us to take this opportunity of expressing 
our appreciation to the Clubs and their officers and 
trainers for what they have done and are doing 
for the betterment of Carnegie Tech. It speaks 
well for the student body of any institution to be 
able to put such excellent organizations in the field. 
Let us hope that nothing will ever happen that will 
in any way work to the hinderance of the good work 
being done.

AN EVEN CHANCE.
An Irishman who intended to take up a home­
stead claim, but who did not know how to go about 
it, sought information from a friend.
“Mike,” he said, “you’ve taken a homestead, and
I thought maybe you could tell me the law concern­
ing it.”
“Well, Dennis, I don't remember the exact word­
ing of the law, but I can give you the meaning of it.
“The meaning is this: The government is will­
ing to bet ye one hundred and sixty acres of land 
agin fourteen dollars that ye can’t live on it five 
years without starving to death.”—'Case Tech.
The teacher of “conversational French” in a 
certain Eastern college was a lively mademoiselle 
“just -over."
• One bright afternoon she stopped two girls 
very excitedly; she wanted to buy an eponge pour 
la bain, but did not know what to ask for.
“Bath sponge. Tell the salesman you want a 
big bath sponge to take home with you,” said the 
girls in chorus, and they accompanied her to the 
village drug store. »
A young clerk stepped forward. Mademoiselle 
advanced bravely.
*‘Please>” she said, smilingly, “will you kindly 
take me home and give me a big sponge bath?”—

Come out to the Glee and Mandolin Clubs’
Concert. Three weeks from now you may not be
eligible to attend at the “Student rates."
And this is the last chance, anyhow—because 
the cornet is going to strike our little old planet 
next spring.
And you and the Glee Club may be widely
separated thereafter.
Last week Prof. Thayer narrowly escaped being 
forcibly taken to the Mutts.
Prof. Follows alluded to Scholl as “The other 
third of the class.” He’s more than that—being 
also the “Brains.”
“Take it, Mr. Elliot,” said Prof. Thayer. “If 
the architect asked you to change the design of 
an arch in order to make it more graceful in out 
line—what would you do?”
“Get another architect,” said Elliot.
“Yes—or rather the architect would get an­
other engineer.”

Barber shops, billiard halls, restaurants, shoe 
shining parlors and similar institutions in the en­
virons of a university should not be allowed to use 
its name or the letters of its name for advertising 
their enterprises, says the Michigan Daily. Not

wise tends to destroy that feeling of respect for a 
university’s title which the community about it, as 
well as its own student body, should have.

Things had been going wrong. The honeymoon 
was scarcely over, but already there was a widen­
ing rift in the lute. The newly married young 
woman was at home on a visit. Her mother and 
sisters were grouped sympathetically around as 
she recounted one nerve-racking matrimonial ex­
perience after another. Her father, a banker, was 
listening in an amused manner to the talk. Finally 
he said:
“Lucy, to hear you talk one would think mar­
riage was a failure.”
She turned to him in exasperation and said 
vehemently:
“Papa, marriage isn’t a failure—it’s a panic.”

Gen. O. O. Howard, as is well known, is a man 
of deep religious principles, and in the course of 
the war he divided his time pretty equally between 
fighting and evangelism. Howard’s brigade was 
known all through the army as the Christian bri­
gade, and he was very proud of it.
There was one hardened old sinner in the bri­
gade, however, whose ears were deaf to all exhor­
tation. General Howard was particularly anxious 
to convert this man, and one day he went down in

A clergyman called upon a member of his congrega­
tion who had been neglecting the Church services, 
and went straight up to the sitting room, and with 
the tongs removed a live coal from off the fire and 
placed it on the hearth, then watched it while it 
turned from the red glow of heat to a black mass. 
The parishioner in question carefully observed the 
proceedings, and then said: “You need not say a 
single word, sir; I’ll be there next Sunday.” If all 
who read this story are as quick to catch the hidden 
meaning of this clergyman’s action as the man re­
ferred to, we may hope that it will produce a similar 
effect.—Selected.

Simon Hardcastle believed with sincere faith that 
any wife who had, or asked, more than a quarter a 
year for her own amusement or enjoyment was a 
being too horrible to contemplate. He came from the 
village store for dinner and told what he had heard.
“Miranda, would you believe that the Lord’s Prayer 
could be engraved in a space no larger than a dime?”
“Well, yes, Simon,” she hazarded, “if a dime is as

think that he would have no difficulty at all.”—Jan­
