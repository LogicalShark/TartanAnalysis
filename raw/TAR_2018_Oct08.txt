Scream Mugger at large in ShadysideEye of the Needle: CMU and opioids
LIKHITHA CHINTAREDDY
Junior Staffwriter
Over 115 people in the 
United States die everyday 
from overdoses on opioids 
like prescription pain 
relievers, heroin, and syn-
thetic opioids like fentanyl. 
This stark statistic reveals 
the extent of the damage 
the opioid crisis has done 
to the people of this coun-
try. And the numbers don’t 
stop there. In 2016, 4600 
Pennsylvanians died of a 
drug overdose. In 2017, 
over 700 people died of 
an overdose in Allegheny 
County alone. The Depart-
ment of Health website 
states that “the prescrip-
tion opioid and heroin 
overdose epidemic is the 
worst public health crisis in 
Pennsylvania.”
From Oct. 1 to 5, our 
campus, in collabora-
tion with the Light of Life 
Rescue Mission, hosted the 
Eye of the Needle, a multi-
media immersive art instal-
lation based on the docu-
mentary of the same name, 
to raise awareness of the 
Opioid Crisis and its impact 
on Pittsburgh.
On Thursday, The Tartan 
sat down with Elizabeth 
Vaughan, Associate Dean 
of Student Affairs and the 
Director of Student Lead-
ership, Involvement, and 
Civic Engagement (SLICE) 
at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, who provided the vi-
sion and the support to this 
event. Speaking on how the 
art installation had come to 
the campus, Vaughan said, 
“Last year, probably early in 
Spring semester, someone 
from Light of Life had con-
tacted CFA about bringing 
Eye of the Needle installa-
tion to the campus — think-
ing about it from like an art 
perspective.”
According to Vaughn, 
the installation opened to 
positive responses from 
visitors, and sparked a 
discussion of the crisis in 
the campus community. 
Televisions inside the tent 
by The Fence housing the 
installation screened the 
11 minute documentary to 
the visitors. Vaughan says 
that several people who vis-
ited the installation  shared 
their own stories about how 
their lives, and the lives of 
their friends, families, and 
coworkers have been affect-
ed due to this crisis. “One 
of the folks who was staff-
ing the installation yester-
day shared a story with me 
that someone who’d gone 
through the installation 
had shared, that they had 
a loved one who was try-
ing to get clean but their 
health insurance had pro-
vided only 10 days of in-
patient treatment, [which 
is] just not suf?cient for 
how signi?cant the grip of 
the addiction is,” she said, 
highlighting the challeng-
es that people who seek 
recovery face.
Eye of the Needle is a 
thought-provoking docu-
mentary that shows the 
human side of this crisis. It 
goes beyond statistics and 
shows people - their lives, 
their stories, and the sto-
ries of their loved ones. It 
gives a dignity and respect 
for the humanity of addicts 
that most discussions of the 
opioid epidemic do not. 
The art installation also had 
similar themes. Speaking of 
this, Vaughan said, “One 
of the primary goals was 
to start the conversation of 
the crisis. I would say that 
what I’ve heard as a really 
signi?cant theme in our 
conversations is the idea of 
not just seeing the problem 
but seeing the person, rec-
ognizing them as a fellow 
human being.”
Vaughan found this 
reaction embodied in a 
re?ection card left by one 
visitor, stating simply,”I see 
you.” Vaughn described 
this as “Like, recognizing, 
you’re the person that I pass 
by [and] see panhandling, 
you’re the person that I 
drive by and see coming out 
of one of the tents in the en-
campment, you are a per-
son and we have this shared 
humanity, and therefore 
I should care because 
you’re also a human being, 
you’re worthy of something 
better than your current 
conditions are.”
The installation has 
become a conversation-
starter for a topic that is 
deeply personal and dif?-
cult for many people in the 
campus community. “In an 
hour and a half period that I 
was staf?ng the installation 
on Tuesday, I had multiple 
staff members who either 
have a sibling or their child 
or their friends’ children 
who’re are struggling with 
addiction,” she said, when 
asked about the extent to 
which the campus commu-
nity itself has been affected 
by this crisis. “I’ve had a 
former faculty member 
who shared an experience 
about a former student of 
Campus climate: can a task force ?x it?

A recent series of 
Shadyside robberies, all per-
petrated by suspects wear-
ing Scream masks, has had 
Carnegie Mellon students 
frightened to be outside at 
night.
Three weeks ago, on 
Wednesday, Sept. 19, the 
Carnegie Mellon commu-
nity was noti?ed via email 
of two robberies that oc-
curred that Monday, Sept. 
17, and one that occurred 
Wednesday, Aug. 29.
The email from the 17th 
speci?es that a woman 
was approached at the cor-
ner of S. Highland Ave. 
and Walnut St. by a sus-
pect “who was wearing a 
‘Scream’ Halloween Mask.” 
Brandishing a black hand-
gun, the suspect “grabbed 
her phone and demanded 
her wallet,” then ?ed on 
foot. Just ?ve minutes lat-
er and a few blocks away, 
another woman was held 
up by a suspect in a black 
scream mask. “He pointed 
a black handgun at her 
and demanded her phone, 
purse, and backpack.”
Last weekend on Sept. 
29, another victim was held 
up by someone wearing a 
Scream mask, this time on 
the corner of Euclid and 
South Negley. Though local 
news stations have reported 
on this, the Carnegie Mellon 
community has yet to be no-
ti?ed in the same manner as 
the previous incidents.
Many Carnegie Mellon 
students who live in 
Shadyside report that since 
being noti?ed, they have 
been returning home from 
campus earlier than usual. 
“I leave around 7 or 8, latest 
9. Before, I would stay until 
11 or 12” says Sophia Kim, a 
sophomore design student 
who lives on Bellefonte St. 
Kim didn’t think too much of 
the ?rst robberies, but “after 
the 4th time [last week-
end] I’ve been going home 
earlier.” She’s been walk-
ing home with friends and 
doing more work at home.

On Aug. 22, President 
Farnam Jahanian noti?ed the 
Carnegie Mellon community of 
the new President’s Task Force 
on Campus Climate, an initia-
tive intended to make the cam-
pus culture and environment 
better for all members. Though 
the appointment was motivated 
partially by the resignation of 
Dr. Lenore Blum and Dr. Manuel 
Blum the week prior, President 
Jahanian was careful to note 
that the Task Force is not en-
tirely reactive; the occasion pro-
vides campus leaders with the 
opportunity to “check in with 
our community, reaf?rm our 
commitment to our values and 
identify ways for us to do better 
in living up to them.”
Lenore and Manuel Blum, 
longtime and in?uential com-
puter science professors, an-
nounced their resignation in 
mid-August, citing professional 
harassment and sexist manage-
ment practices. Lenore Blum, 
in an interview with NEXTpitts-
burgh, said that her decision has 
led to a strong response from 
the Carnegie Mellon commu-
nity: “many [women] express-
ing almost a cathartic relief that 
I had dared to air experiences 
they recognized. Many thanked 
me and wrote about their own 
stories, in poetry and prose.” 
She later continued, “I am talk-
ing about sexism in the work-
place. Subtle biases and micro-
aggressions pile up.”
The metaphorical pile 
she’s referring to is what cam-
pus leaders are now labeling 
“climate.” In the past three to 
?ve years, schools across the 
country have created similar 
climate initiatives as knowledge 
about microaggressions and 
other subtle forms of oppression 
have reached the mainstream. 
At Carnegie Mellon, climate is 
loosely de?ned as a measure 
of how inclusive, equitable, 
respectful, and understand-
ing the community is of all our 
members.
“That’s where we’re 
starting,” said Jodi Forlizzi, Task 
Force co-chair and professor of 
design at the Human-Computer 
Interaction Institute, in an 
interview with The Tartan. “As a 
Task Force, we’ll come up with 
more speci?cs on what exactly 
that means.”
The full list of Task Force 
members was released on Sept. 
26, consisting of 3 co-chairs and 
29 members from a variety of 
groups in the Carnegie Mellon 
community, including under-
graduate, graduate, and doc-
toral students. With such a large 
team, Forlizzi and her co-chairs 
aren’t certain how the respon-
sibilities will be delegated yet, 
though she hopes to convene a 
meeting of the full Task Force 
in the next two weeks. She lik-
ened the Force to a ?ock of birds 
to describe how it might form 
and reform around priorities 
and initiatives. “It’s a huge set 
of things that we could do,” she 
said, giving a nod to the scale of 
the project.
Though she was smiling 
while she said it, her analogy 
echoes the importance of 
?exibility in this initiative. The 
of?cial charge, as speci?ed by 
President Jahanian, consists of 
both proactive and reactive so-
lutions to issues surrounding 
the campus climate. Because 
there are so many stakeholders 
and numerous related initia-
tives on campus, members of 
the Task Force will have to be 
open to as much information 
and conversation as possible. 
The website features a name-
optional feedback form where 
faculty, staff, and students can 
submit inquiries and sugges-
tions to be read by the co-chairs 
themselves. With such a large 
team, however, Forlizzi hopes 
the Task Force will be able to 
connect face-to-face with as 
many people as possible.
“Anyone is welcome to come 
and talk and learn more,” she 
said, noting her open-door 
policy. In the few weeks since 
the announcement of her role, 
she has already heard stories 
from a few community mem-
bers. The goal is to keep these 
personal dialogues going 
throughout the year and to en-
sure that all of the Task Force 
members are engaging in them. 
“I hope everybody is approach-
able,” she continued. “People 
have agreed to serve and that 
means having conversations 
and listening.”
Listening, and being 
listened to, is something that 
Lenore Blum felt was miss-
ing from Carnegie Mellon 
when she left. After starting 
Carnegie Mellon’s success-
ful Project Olympus incubator 
and serving as co-director of 
the Center for Innovation and 
Entrepreneurship (CIE) for a 
number of years, Blum wit-
nessed a sharp change in man-
agement when the CIE recently 
became the Swartz Center 
for Entrepreneurship. “The 
equitable balance became one 
that, I’ve come to understand, 
is inherently sexist,” she told 
NEXTpittsburgh. “This corpo-
rate model, with a CEO-like 
position holding almost com-
plete control [...] enables wan-
ton abuse of power given bad 
actors at the helm.”

Special to The Tartan
Hello Students,
I hope the school year 
has been going well for ev-
eryone. I wanted to take 
this opportunity to reach 
out to all of you and give an 
update on how the Under-
graduate Student Senate 
has been working hard be-
hind the scenes to improve 
your Carnegie Mellon ex-
perience. We are currently 
working with the adminis-
tration to monitor the add/
drop deadline policy to see 
how students feel about it. 
We are also working with 
the administration to help 
create the Consensual Re-
lationships Policy. Our 
Finance Committee has 
currently approved over 
$4,000 to organizations on 
campus to help them start 
new initiatives and proj-
ects.
With this in mind, start-
ing Oct. 21, we have a new 
project we are undertaking: 
Senate Week. Starting on 
Sunday and going through 
Thursday, the Senate will 
be holding various events 
geared towards students. 
We want to take this time to 
meet with our constituents 
on a more personal level so 
that we can get feedback 
on how their experience at 
Carnegie Mellon has been. 
Keep an eye out for the 
Strip Crawl on the 21st. The 
Campus Life committee will 
be providing free transpor-
tation to and from the Strip 
District where vendors will 
be offering Carnegie Mel-
lon Students discounts on 
various merchandise and 
food. Look out for the full 
list of vendors, which will 
be con?rmed soon.
As always, if you have 
any questions about the 
Student Senate and what 
we do, please feel free to 
email me: shraiyg@andrew.
cmu.edu. Or you can visit us 
at our table during Scotty 
Saturday!
Enjoy the rest of your 
week!

CMU team competes in DARPA Subterranean Challenge
WILSON EKERN
Copy Manager
If you were in Pittsburgh 
last year, you might remem-
ber seeing the self-driving 
Ubers cruising around the 
more gentri?ed areas of the 
city. That project seems to 
have been sidelined after a 
few of Uber’s autonomous 
vehicles self-drove into pe-
destrians, but they wouldn’t 
have even existed in the ?rst 
place without the 2007 Ur-
ban Challenge. The Urban 
Challenge, the second such 
project from the Depart-
ment of Defense’s (DoD) 
research arm, the Defense 
Advanced Research Proj-
ects Agency (DARPA), 
challenged teams to create 
autonomous vehicles that 
could operate in an urban 
environment. The Carnegie 
Mellon Tartan Racing team 
won the $2 million dollar 
grand prize in the chal-
lenge, which helped lay the 
groundwork for the recent 
self-driving explosion, from 
Tesla to Google to the afore-
mentioned Uber. For the 
newest DARPA challenge, 
the Carnegie Mellon team 
has a new environment to 
navigate: underground.
The DARPA Subter-
ranean Challenge will 
test teams on their abil-
ity to navigate three 
underground spaces: tun-
nels, caves, and the “urban 
underground.” According to 
the challenge’s website, the 
goal is to “drive novel ap-
proaches and technologies 
to allow war?ghters and 
?rst responders to rapidly 
map, navigate, and search 
dynamic underground 
environments.”
The Carnegie Mellon 
team is led by Sebastian 
Scherer and Matt Travers, 
senior systems scientist 
and systems scientist, 
respectively, at the Robot-
ics Institute. The team is 
composed of a core group 
of 15-20, including mem-
bers from Oregon State 
University, and also in-
cludes classes focused on 
solving key challenges, as 
well as many undergradu-
ate and graduate students. 
Scherer, who has worked 
on several Carnegie Mellon 
DARPA Challenge teams, 
says that the Subterranean 
Challenge “is really about 
sending back a map and a 
location of where different 
objects are [without] using 
biological systems.”
The team’s approach 
will be to “have a [modular] 
perception system which 
tells us...where we are 
going, [while] at the center 
it creates a map and classi-
fies [objects],” using robots 
of varying mobilities, from 
crawling to flying. Scherer 
says that a positive element 
of the DARPA challenges 
is that they “really kind 
of force you to put [exist-
ing technologies] togeth-
er,” which can result in 
interesting and innovative 
new approaches.
The Carnegie Mellon 
team is one of six receiving 
up to $4.5 million to “de-
velop the robotic platforms, 
sensors, and software 
necessary to accomplish 
unprecedented under-
ground missions,” accord-
ing to a Carnegie Mellon 
press release, making this 
project one of the many at 
Carnegie Mellon receiving 
funding from the military. 
When asked about the pos-
sible applications of the 
research, Scherer said that 
“the challenge is really gen-
eral,” with possible appli-
cations in “mining...search 
and rescue after [things 
like] earthquakes,” and 
that the military’s strat-
egy is “to get ahead in sci-
ence...so they invest a lot in 
science and technology.”
The technologies 
resulting from the previous 
challenges have already 
been used to develop au-
tonomous vehicles for the 
military, and it stands to 
reason that the novel, in-
teresting solutions to these 
problems will as well. Bob 
Hastie, a senior techni-
cal adviser at the Defense 
Threat Reduction Agency, 
was quoted by C4ISRNET as 
saying that the goal of these 
projects is to “take the 
human out of [danger-
ous jobs] and use autono-
mous systems and robotic 
systems to...protect our 
warfighters.”
Whether the new 
technologies resulting 
from the Subterranean 
Challenge will be used for 
war is unclear, but prob-
able: you don’t invest 
in something without 
expecting a return. The 
fact that the DoD, rather 
than the National Science 
Foundation, funds these 
projects means that the 
DARPA challenges, whatev-
er their possible commer-
cial or humanitarian ben-
efits, are geared towards 
solving military problems.
“This wasn’t the ?rst 
time I had heard of hor-
ri?c things happening in 
Shadyside,” commented 
a Masters student who 
did not wish to be named. 
After explaining that the 
robberies were not shock-
ing, but reaf?rming of 
the dangers that lurk off 
campus, she boarded the 
71C bus, heading home to 
Shadyside at 4:45 p.m.
Many students are trou-
bled by the university’s 
delayed reporting of these 
incidents. The ?rst mass 
email was sent out weeks 
after the attack, which was 
perpetrated on someone 
described in the email as 
a Carnegie Mellon af?li-
ate. Carnegie Mellon Chief 
of Police Thomas Ogden 
explained that crimes that 
occur off campus are not 
reported to them. They 
can only release alerts 
after substantiating the 
facts with the police agen-
cy that has jurisdiction. 
Ogden assured that “We 
are attempting to improve 
communications with 
Pittsburgh and Pitt Police 
relative to timeliness with 
incidents that happen in 
their jurisdictions.”
The Pittsburgh Police 
department did not re-
spond to repeated requests 
for comment, but there 
seems to be an increased 
number of patrol cars in 
the Shadyside area.
Though cable news 
sensationalized the fact 
that all of the victims so 
far have been women, 
Ogden clari?ed that, as of 
Oct. 4, “all of the victims 
were not female.” Dan 
Dellobade, a Masters stu-
dent in Health Care Policy 
and Management, was “a 
little shocked” at the news 
of the robberies but not too 
discomforted. He acknowl-
edged, “I wouldn’t say I’m 
a typical target being that 
I’m a bigger male.”
Chief Ogden “strongly 
encourages our commu-
nity members to not walk 
alone at night, to use our 
Shuttle system when pos-
sible, to be alert to their 
surroundings, and report 
anything suspicious to the 
police.”
hers who became addicted 
while he was a student here 
and he dropped out, and 
then, unfortunately, over-
dosed and passed away… 
I don’t have any numeri-
cal values to provide… but 
what I’ve become shock-
ingly aware of is truly how 
many people on our cam-
pus have been affected in 
some way and are living 
with the challenges of that 
day to day.”
What is it that they 
want to achieve through 
this installation? Vaughan 
explains, “I think one piece 
of what they’re trying to do 
is show the actual condi-
tions… the reality of the sit-
uation and they’re not try-
ing to sugar coat it. That’s 
why the items are directly 
taken from the street, ev-
erything from the leaves to 
the trash to the furniture 
- everything that you saw 
there was directly from the 
street other than the tents. 
I think they’re trying to 
show the range of people’s 
circumstances.” Vaughan 
also shared a powerful ex-
perience that she had due 
to the installation, “I actu-
ally was walking out of the 
installation opposite of the 
direction that we typically 
walk through just yester-
day. And I looked over, and 
realized that there was a 
little baby shoe there... and 
I hadn’t seen that when I 
had walked through the 
other direction… I’m a 
mother of 3 kids and I can’t 
imagine my children hav-
ing to live in that environ-
ment… I just can’t imagine 
that.”
As a community, we can 
fight back. The Light of 
the Life Rescue mission is 
actively working to reduce 
addiction and homeless-
ness in Pittsburgh, and we 
have lots of opportunities 
to volunteer with them. 
Another organization that 
Carnegie Mellon has a 
long-standing relationship 
with is Sojourner House. 
There are lots of other or-
ganizations that are work-
ing with the homeless 
population like Bethlehem 
Haven and Living Ministry 
if one wishes to take direct 
action. “But,” Vaughan, 
adds, “there’s also an elec-
tion coming up in Novem-
ber. If this is an issue you 
care about, educate your-
self in the local, state, and 
national level… candidates 
that are running - what are 
their positions on getting 
increased accessible care, 
prevention, and what are 
their positions and what 
are their priorities and 
goals related to the cri-
sis and whatever lies the 
closest to your value set 
and the education set that 
you’ve provided yourself, 
you know, doing research 
and then support those 
candidates. So, I do think 
we have to be working at 
all of those levels for us to 
really make progress.”
But most importantly, 
Vaughan says, “If you sus-
pect something is going on, 
you have to say something. 
Having the courage to ad-
dress the suspicion, the 
concern, and to say, ‘I care 
about you. I’m worried. 
What’s going on? Can I 
help you get connected to 
help?’ and not to be an ac-
tive bystander. You don’t 
know if saying something 
will help that person get 
into care at that moment 
but it is demonstrating 
that their life is valuable 
and that they are worthy 
of love, of support, and re-

that helps get them con-

to have the courage to have 
that hard conversation.”

Trump’s zero-tolerance policy puts migrant children in temporary tent cities in TX
In the past couple of months, 
hundreds of bleary-eyed migrant 
children have been ushered onto 
buses in the middle of the night. 
They leave the shelter without 
saying goodbye and travel 
hundreds of miles across barren 
landscapes to a cluster of tents in 
West Texas, their new home.
According to The New York 
Times, the tent city is located in 
Tornillo, Texas, around 35 miles 
east of El Paso on the Mexican 
border. The tents uniformly 
rise from the ground in parallel 
lines, white and blocky against a 
backdrop of dirt. Many tents are 
air-conditioned, but outside there 
is little reprieve from the scorching 
Texas heat. For many children, it’s 
an unfamiliar and unwelcome 
change.
Before this development, 
most migrant children lived in 
private foster homes or shelters. 
The shelters, while not ideal, 
are usually more regulated 
than the tents. They’re licensed 
and monitored by state child 
welfare authorities, who enforce 
standards on safety, education, 
staff hiring, and staff training. 
Children are clustered two or three 
to a room, and they receive regular 
schooling and visits with legal 
representatives.
But the tent city in Tornillo, 
Texas works a little differently. 
It’s on federal ground, so state 
of?cials have no authority. The 
only regulations are the guidelines 
created by the Department of 
Health and Human Services 
(HHS). The children sleep in bunks, 
sometimes twenty to a room. They 
don’t receive organized schooling; 
they’re given workbooks with no 
obligation to actually complete 
them. Their access to legal advice 
is also limited.
The Tornillo tent city was 
meant to be temporary. Opened in 
mid-June 2018, it was originally 
slated to stay open for 30 days. 
But as the amount of migrant 
children increased, the timeline 
was continually extended, and as 
of October 2018, it is still open. 
In fact, it’s more than open: it’s 
expanding. According to Texas 
Monthly, the number of beds 
increased from 1,200 to 3,800 in 
September, and the facility is now 
slated to stay open for the rest of 
the year.
Unsurprisingly, the tent city 
is not a productive environment 
for children already dealing 
with trauma. According to The 
New York Times, Leah Chavla, a 
lawyer with the Women’s Refugee 
Commission, said, “obviously 
we have concerns about kids 
falling through the cracks, not 
getting suf?cient attention if they 
need attention, not getting the 
emotional or mental health care 
that they need.”
So far, these concerns seem 
to be founded. “The longer that 
children remain in custody,” 
The New York Times says, “the 
more likely they are to become 
anxious or depressed.” Anxiety 
and depression can lead to 
erratic behavior, such as violent 
outbursts or escape attempts. The 
suddenness of the move could also 
compound the trauma. Mental 
health issues are hard for shelters 
to deal with at the best of times, 
and a large facility like Tornillo 
is much more likely to overlook a 
struggling child.
The tent cities are obviously not 
the best solution, so why do they 
still exist?
There are two main 
reasons. Firstly, the amount 
of undocumented children in 
government custody has increased 
considerably. The majority of 
detained children crossed the 
border alone, but some were 
separated from their parents under 
the Trump administration’s zero-
tolerance policy. The government 
is struggling to ?nd room for 
around 13,000 detained migrant 
children, and tent cities seemed 
like an easy and effective way to 
provide housing.
Secondly, the zero-tolerance 
policy made it much more dif?cult 
to place children with sponsors. 
In June, federal authorities 
announced that potential sponsors 
and all other adults in the 
household would have to submit 
?ngerprints. Historically, most 
sponsors were undocumented 
immigrants themselves, usually 
family of the detained children. 
If they submit their ?ngerprints, 
they run the risk of deportation. 
Already, dozens of people who 
applied to be sponsors have been 
arrested, 70 percent of whom did 
not have prior criminal records. 
Many potential sponsors have 
decided the risk just isn’t worth it.
These circumstances — the 
tent cities, the lack of sponsors, 
the children’s suffering — are a 
direct result of rhetoric from the 
Trump administration and its 
allies. The growing population 
of migrant children is due to the 
zero-tolerance policy; the lack 
of sponsors is due to the same. 
The Tornillo tent city, which costs 
$100 million a month in taxpayer 
money, is the result of racist and 
unsympathetic ideas.
The entire situation is a clear 
example of why rhetoric can be 
dangerous. It goes beyond hurt 
feelings and individual actions; 
it infects our government and 
institutions. It leads to intolerable 
living conditions and facilitates 
child abuse. An incendiary speech 
can be traced through time to 
crying children.
This is why we have to strike 
back at hateful rhetoric. Our 
society must draw a line. We must 
proclaim that we won’t tolerate 
the suffering of children and then 
follow that thread back to its 
source. Criticizing rhetoric is not 
an overreaction; it’s preventative 
of a much greater evil.
Fortunately, many politicians 
and in?uential ?gures have spoken 
against the cities and policies. 
Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman 
for the HHS, said, “The number 
of families and unaccompanied 
alien children apprehended are a 
symptom of the larger problem, 
namely a broken immigration 
system...That is why HHS joins the 
president in calling on Congress to 
reform this broken system.”
While the wounds run 
deep, there is still hope. If we 
make ourselves as loud as our 
competition, we may be able to 
reverse the harmful decisions 
that have already been made, 
encourage compassionate policies, 
prevent such hateful rhetoric, and 
create a safer world for children of 
all legal statuses.

Process-oriented learning in secondary education
FRANK HU
Staffwriter
Ever since elementary school, we 
were always told to show our work, 
so that in the event we got the 
answer wrong, we could get some 
partial credit. Documenting your 
thought processes is most prevalent 
in the STEM ?elds, where exams are 
designed to assess topics requiring 
some element of computation and 
critical thinking.
The idea of receiving partial 
credit is great, not just because 
it helps students score better on 
exams, but because it encourages 
students to try to show what 
they know. However, despite the 
consensus among instructors that 
the process should matter more 
than the answer, in many cases, 
getting the answer wrong can still 
cost you a hefty amount of points. 
Sometimes, that can make the 
difference between letter grades.
Now yes, almost correct is not the 
same thing as correct, so the ?nal 
answer is not irrelevant. However, 
no matter how well a student 
understands the process towards 
solving a problem, or no matter how 
ingenious their approach, there will 
always be the possibility of stupid 
or careless errors, ones that re?ect 
the student’s humanity rather than 
their understanding.
It’s a tragic tale, one we see all 
too often in high school math and 
science classes: a student takes a 
test and attempts a problem, doing 
every step ?awlessly up until the 
last one, where a negative sign gets 
dropped or the quantity two plus 
three magically becomes six. Thus, 
the ?nal answer is incorrect, and 
points are deducted, sometimes 
in outrageously large quantities. 
Unlike in college, where professors 
understand that the purpose of a 
course is to teach you how to think 
about something, high school 
instructors are more focused on 
teaching you how to do something, 
and when the mechanics of a 
problem are the primary focus, the 
answer has a much higher value.
The issue is that there’s no way 
to eliminate the risk of careless 
mistakes aside from checking 
over your work countless times, 
which is something that you often 
can’t do under a time constraint. 
And it’s not the same as a failure 
in understanding, where the 
student fails in their application 
or recollection of a concept or 
method; that can be recti?ed with 
increased studying and practice. 
This narrow mindset of always 
trying to get the right answer leads 
to students being more preoccupied 
with doing everything correctly 
than comprehending everything 
correctly. Consequently, when the 
real goal is to become more agile 
and adaptive problem solvers, 
they’re being shortchanged.
In the real world, problems 
don’t have nicely predetermined 
solutions; otherwise, they wouldn’t 
be worth addressing. The emphasis 
here is entirely on what you know 
and how you can apply it, not if you 
can crunch numbers properly like 
a computer (we have calculators 
for a reason). By forcing students 
to waste time muddling through 
complex — but pointless — algebra 
or computing astronomical sums by 
hand, instructors are doing them 
a disservice by wasting their time, 
time that could otherwise be spent 
delving into new and intriguing 
concepts or going beyond the scope 
of the class. Students who receive 
this enrichment are better prepared 
for the struggles of post-secondary 
education and beyond, whereas 
those who do not ?nd it dif?cult to 
grapple with deviations from the 
standard of perfection.
Some will argue that the 
repetition of basics is important, 
especially for people that ?nd 
learning challenging. By no means 
am I advocating that slower 
students should be left behind in 
favor of pandering to the more 
accelerated ones, or vice versa; 
rather, I believe that all students 
can bene?t from more process-
oriented learning and more focus 
on mastering the material rather 
than their exams. Already, there’s 
been some substantial progress 
made on this front, with most tests 
requiring a written explanation 
for an answer or moving towards 
including questions that ask 
students to describe a certain 
problem-solving process rather 
than explicitly implementing it.
The whole point of a good 
education system is to turn students 
into effective problem solvers, and 
that process really takes off right 
around high school. As the world 
becomes increasingly complex 
and interconnected, so too do 
the challenges in every realm of 
inquiry. It is imperative that we arm 
students not only with the correct 
knowledge but also the correct 
mindset for learning. Education 
is a lifelong process, and it’s not 
about what you do at the beginning 
or end, but at every step along the 
way.
The fallacy of the mainstream #BelieveWomen tag
MADELINE KIM

#MeToo. #TimesUp. Now 
#BelieveWomen has gained 
traction on social media to call 
attention to the prevalence of 
sexual assault, bolstered by Dr. 
Christine Blasey Ford’s recent 
hearing regarding the allegations 
against Associate Justice of the 
Supreme Court nominee, Brett 
Kavanaugh. The discussion of how 
we prevent future cases of sexual 
assault and how we handle current 
cases is now front and center.
Given current statistics, true 
allegations supersede false 
accusations, and it is estimated that 
60 percent of rapes go unreported. 
Therefore, it is understandable 
where the sentiment “believe 
women” comes from: women are 
far more likely to not report a rape 
than they are to falsely claim they 
have been raped.
In Ford’s case, I ?nd it very 
likely that Kavanaugh assaulted 
her. However, the reach of 
#BelieveWomen exceeds far 
beyond the Supreme Court 
nomination. Even after the votes, 
we still must grapple with how to 
deal with sexual assault.
It is unfortunate that due process 
is necessary. If there was a way to 
bring forth justice without forcing 
victims to relive their traumatic 
experiences, I like to believe such a 
method would have been brought 
to the public’s attention. However, 
the Sixth Amendment grants all 
the right to a fair trial. In the case 
of the Scottsboro boys in 1931, 
“believe women” cost nine African 
American teenage men their lives 
without a chance for any of them 
to redeem their innocence. Of 
course, the boys’ Sixth Amendment 
rights were infringed; the court 
was obviously racially biased. 
However, it demonstrates what the 
absence of the Sixth Amendment 
could lead to. Of course, the same 
right must be granted to victims 
of sexual assault, and too often, 
that’s not the case. For that, I will 
agree with the general consensus 
of #BelieveWomen. However, 
due process is still necessary, 
and simply hearing someone’s 
testimony, unfortunately, is not 
enough.
Additionally, the name itself 
can appear to further reinforce the 
male-perpetrator-female-victim 
trope that many have ingrained 
in their heads. One could argue 
that this exists because sexual 
assault affects more females than 
males. This may be technically 
true, but we must reconsider 
that premise. In 2016, a study 
from the University of California, 
Los Angeles (UCLA) estimated 
that approximately 38 percent 
of victims of sexual violence are 
male. So yes, as of 2016, the 
proportion of females to males 
differ by ten percentage points. 
However, we cast aside over a third 
of the people whom we are trying 
to help: sexual assault victims. 
The message #BelieveWomen 
can easily be perverted into 
becoming an environment where 
male victims fear that their voices 
against their female perpetrators 
won’t be heard. Consent needs to 
exist regardless of characteristics 
such as age, gender, and sexuality; 
gendering a societal problem that 
affects more than just women 
alienates non-female-identifying 
victims.
So what do I believe #Believe-
Women should be? It should not 
involve automatically dismissing 
or delegitimizing someone’s per-
sonal experiences. Too often are 
people shamed or silenced. How-
ever, this is more of a problem in-
volving people’s mindsets than it is 
implementing new policies. Some 
suggestions on improving this 
dialogue would be to incorporate 
consent in schools’ health class 
curricula, having more accessible 
resources such as hotlines and 
shelters, and promoting education 
on how to best support someone 
who experienced sexual assault. 
A trending hashtag on Twitter is 
a good start in capturing people’s 
attention and initiating a conversa-
tion. However, now we must move 
towards continuing the dialogue to 
ensure justice for the victims, and 
to prevent assault from happening 
in the ?rst place.

Last week, the Senate heard 
testimonies from both Brett 
Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine 
Blasey Ford, one of the women 
who has accused Kavanaugh of 
sexual assault. The two testimonies 
couldn’t have been more different, 
and many Republicans claimed 
that they were equally credible. 
Dr. Ford offered a very powerful 
testimony recounting her sexual 
assault and calmly answered 
questions from senators. It was 
a moment destined to go down 
in the history books, as Ford held 
her ground in front of several men 
questioning her credibility.
Kavanaugh’s testimony was the 
polar opposite. He dodged several 
questions, got angry and defensive, 
and lashed out during the entire 
process. Throughout the hearing, 
he acted like a petulant and entitled 
child rather than the innocent man 
he claimed to be. Yet he got a lot of 
praise from Republican senators 
for having an incredible testimony. 
I would like to take a step back 
from the crimes that Kavanaugh is 
accused of or the credibility of the 
two testimonies and simply focus 
on his actions in the testimony.
The Supreme Court is a 
signi?cant last resort for decision 
processes in the United States. It’s 
up to nine individuals to determine 
the law of the land, divorced from 
political party af?liations and 
based on their interpretation of the 
Constitution. That’s what makes 
Kavanaugh’s behavior so deeply 
concerning. To directly quote him 
from the testimony:
“This whole two-week effort has 
been a calculated and orchestrated 
political hit, fueled with apparent 
pent-up anger about President 
Trump and the 2016 election.”
This should not be the tone of 
someone who is going to be on the 
Supreme Court. It sounded like 
he channeled the spirit of Trump 
to make that statement. The 
Supreme Court isn’t meant to be a 
partisan institution. Of course, due 
to the nomination process being 
started by the President, the court 
certainly isn’t entirely nonpartisan. 
However, Kavanaugh’s testimony 
speaks volumes, showing that he 
will approach cases in his tenure 
with a clear and inherent bias.
He also provided very 
misleading defenses to the 
committee. The most signi?cant 
example was when he stated 
that three people Dr. Ford had 
mentioned in her statement, two 
of whom were his friends and 
one of whom was her longtime 
friend, had denied her account. 
This isn’t true. Not corroborating 
Dr. Ford’s account does not equate 
to a denial of her account. As a 
supposed expert in law, he should 
be well aware of this distinction, 
and yet, he willfully chose to make 
this statement at the hearing. It 
shows cracks in his honesty and 
temperament, and this wasn’t 
the sole scenario. When asked 
about terms that he used, such 
as “boo?ng” or “devil’s triangle,” 
he called the terms a reference to 
“?atulence” and a “drinking game” 
respectively, neither of which is 
true. It’s ?at-out perjury because 
he lied about what those words 
really mean.
His responses to some simple 
questions, such as questions about 
whether or not he was prone to 
blacking out or how much he 
drank, were boorish and hostile. 
He would turn the question back 
on the senators, talk over them, 
or avoid the questions entirely. He 
didn’t even outright say that he 
would support an FBI investigation 
into the allegations. In any other 
scenario, anyone who acted as 
Kavanaugh did would likely have 
been held in contempt of court. 
Instead of being composed as 
a judge should, he opted to be 
belligerent and aggressive in both 
his prepared speech and answers to 
questions.
Of course, for Republicans, 
none of this matters. Having 
a conservative judge on the 
court is essential for them, since 
Kavanaugh’s con?rmation would 
guarantee a conservative majority. 
This has been a big talking point 
to muster up support for the 
midterm elections and galvanize 
the Republican voter base. An 
NBC/NPR/Marist Poll showed 
that 54 percent of Republicans 
would support Kavanaugh’s 
con?rmation, even if the assault 
allegations are proven to be 
true. Republicans chose to stick 
by Kavanaugh because if they 
didn’t, they’d be seen as weak and 
ineffective, even if it would be the 
right choice to pick somebody else 
from the Federalist Society list that 
Kavanaugh was picked from. Be it 
Bill Clinton or Brett Kavanaugh, 
powerful men who further political 
agendas will always get a pass even 
though they clearly don’t deserve 
it.
Dr. Ford herself said in her 
testimony that she was afraid 
she would uproot her entire life 
by coming and speaking out. 
Unfortunately, she found herself 
testifying only for nothing to 
happen and for the status quo to 
be maintained. In fact, after the 
hearing, Orrin Hatch referred to 
Dr. Ford as a “pleasing” witness. 
The senators listened to Dr. Ford, 
but they didn’t hear her because 
they had already made up their 
minds on Kavanaugh. For them, 
politics and power are more 
important than the trauma and 
abuse faced by survivors of sexual 
assault. Allowing Kavanaugh in 
the Supreme Court will go down 
in history as one of the greatest 
mistakes ever made in our nation’s 
history.

Midterms are of?cially less 
than a month away, and potential 
2020 candidates are already 
eyeing up their chances of taking 
Trump. For the past year, the 
names of many Democrats have 
been thrown onto the list of 
2020 hopefuls. Many of these 
potential Democratic candidates 
have remained tight-lipped about 
running for president because 
it would be a poor strategic 
move to jump the gun before the 
Midterms. Many Democrats have 
not announced their bids for 
President; however, their actions 
before the Midterm elections have 
led many to speculate.
Senator Cory Booker’s name 
tends to be at the top of the list 
of 2020 Democratic candidates 
because he has been a prominent 
?gure for the Democrats since 
he assumed of?ce in 2013. 
Booker recently made news 
during the Brett Kavanaugh 
Senate hearing for threatening 
to release committee con?dential 
documents related to Kavanaugh’s 
tenure in the George W. Bush 
administration. This threat came 
with a possible ousting from 
the Senate, since it violated the 
Senate rules; however, this threat 
was not as risky as it may have 
seemed since the documents had 
already been cleared for release. 
Despite this fact, Booker referred 
to the release of the documents as 
his “Spartacus” moment, when in 
fact, it was a political move to in 
preparation to announcing his bid.
Senator Kamala Harris (D-
CA), Booker’s close friend and 
colleague on the Judiciary 
Committee, has risen to the top 
of the Democratic Party since 
she took of?ce in 2017. Due to 
the recent events surrounding 
sexual assault allegations against 
Kavanaugh, Senator Harris has 
been a powerful anti-Kavanaugh 
voice on the Judiciary Committee, 
demonstrating her desire to 
run for president. During Dr. 
Ford’s testimony against Judge 
Kavanaugh, Senator Harris 
praised Dr. Ford and called her a 
“pro?le in courage,” causing Dr. 
Ford to tear up. Senator Harris 
has been an outspoken feminist 
supporter, with many women 
begging her to run for President.
At her Massachusetts town 
hall, Senator Elizabeth Warren 
(D-MA) declared that she would 
“take a hard look” at running 
for President after the Midterm 
elections. Warren’s name has been 
tossed around quite frequently 
after Trump was elected, as 
Warren has been a strong Trump 
critic. Warren would be a strong 
candidate to go head to head 
against Trump if she can provide 
a campaign that is optimistic, not 
one that singularly bashes the 
current administration.
Whoever wins the Democratic 
bid for the presidential nominee 
must not stoop down to Donald 
Trump’s level. Michael Avenatti, 
Stormy Daniels’ attorney, 
has stated that he is seriously 
considering a run for President in 
2020 as he has been very popular 
in the news media. Avenatti 
probably would never win the 
Democratic bid for President; 
however, if he decides to run, he 
could gain attention from the 
news media for bashing Trump 
with his un?ltered attitude.
The Democrats should not focus 
all of their energy on condemning 
Trump; rather, they should take 
notice of Beto O’Rourke and his 
impressive progressive campaign 
against Ted Cruz in Texas, which 
has historically been a deeply red 
state. While chances are slim that 
O’Rourke will win, his campaign 
should be the model for Democrats 
in the 2020 election because he 
has been able to persuade more 
moderate and conservative voters.
Donald Trump does well in 
appealing to his base of voters, 
but in building that base he 
has alienated a large group of 
conservatives. Those conservative 
voters could be converted to votes 
for Democrats if the Democrats 
listen to their concerns instead 
of talking at them. A big problem 
within the Democratic Party is that 
they do not seem to know where 
they are headed. Some Democrats 
have become so focused on trolling 
Trump that they have forgotten 
what they actually stand for. In 
order to kick Trump out of of?ce, 
the Democratic candidate must 
offer the nation a better option by 
highlighting policies and hopes for 
the future.

Woman wins Nobel Prize in Physics for 3rd time in history
SIMRAN KHUNGER
Junior Staffwriter
On Tuesday, Oct. 2, Dr. 
Donna Strickland made 
history, and received the 
Nobel laureate in Physics. 
An associate professor at the 
University of Waterloo, she 
is joined by Gerard Moreau 
for their research into 
high-intensity laser pulses. 
Strickland and Moreau’s 
work led to huge advances 
in the technology of eye 
surgery, especially with 
regards to myopia (they 
share the distinction with 
Arthur Ashkin, a scientist 
at Bell Laboratories, for 
his research in optical 
tweezers, high precision 
tools used to examine 
extremely small particles).
Strickland is one of the 
only three women to have 
ever won the Nobel Prize in 
Physics, and the ?rst in 55 
years — the others being 
Marie Curie (1903) and 
Jocelyn Bell Burnell (1974).
Wen looking at the 
data from the Statistical 
Research Center at the 
American Institute of 
Physics, the lack of female 
Physics Nobel Prize winners 
seems suspicious, since 
the rate of female Physics 
Ph.D.’s far exceeds that of 
female Nobel Prize winners. 
In fact, the research shows 
that there is less than a two 
percent chance that only 
male scientists would have 
won the award for such a 
long duration of time.
Until her Nobel win, 
Strickland and her work did 
not have a Wikipedia page; 
Wikipedia administrators 
claimed that “this 
submission’s references do 
not show that the subject 
quali?es for a Wikipedia 
article,” according to 
Vox. In contrast, her 
colleague Moreau has had 
a Wikipedia page for over a 
decade.
Also controversial is 
Strickland’s status at the 
University of Waterloo. 
Many question her title as 
only an associate professor 
when her work is in?uential 
enough to earn a Nobel 
Prize.
Strickland’s Nobel 
win has provoked 
conversations about the 
lack of recognition of 
women’s achievements in 
physics, but it isn’t the most 
controversial event to do so 
in the last few weeks.
During the last 
week of September, the 
European Organization 
for Nuclear Research 
(CERN) hosted a workshop 
on the intersection of 
gender diversity and nu-
clear research, mostly 
attended by women early 
in their research careers. 
A CERN physicist named 
Alessandro Strumia gave a 
lecture purportedly on the 
statistics of gender in the 
?eld of physics; however, 
the talk turned out to be an 
anti-diversity tirade.
Strumia labeled efforts 
to support women in 
science a “victimocracy,” 
railed against the “PC 
thought police,” and 
explained that it’s more 
dif?cult for men in research 
than women, citing data 
that has been widely 
decried as pseudoscienti?c 
(including some anecdotal 
evidence about women 
who had been chosen 
over him for research 
positions). He also made 
several factually inaccurate 
claims — for example, 
that women physicists 
like Marie Curie have 
always been “welcomed” 
by male researchers after 
they show “what they 
can do.” Despite having a 
Nobel and the discovery 
of two elements to her 
name, Curie was rejected 
by the French Academy of 
Sciences.
CERN later released 
a statement disavowing 
the derogatory remarks, 
stating that they are 
strongly committed to 
promoting diversity in 
their organization and 
that Strumia has been 
suspended.
The American Institute 
of Physics found that for 
the past 15 years in the 
United States, women 
and men are roughly 
equally likely to attain 
internships and research 
positions. Yet, the Nobel 
Prize overwhelmingly 
acknowledges men’s 
achievements.
One possible explan-
ation? Throughout the 
world, women have much 
less access to resources 
than male researchers. 
A paper published by 
the Canadian Medical 
Association Journal shows 
that women are less likely to 
earn research funding than 
their male counterparts. 
This undercuts their ability 
to have access to resources 
that are crucial for their 
research.
Strickland’s achieve-
ment is a sign that despite 
these inequalities, women 
are doing groundbreaking 
work in physics. Although 
women face many 
obstacles as they surge 
forward in their ?elds, 
Strickland shines as a 
beacon of hope in the 
otherwise male-dominated 
world of academia.

50 million+ Facebook accounts hacked
ASHWIN SRINIVASAN
Assistant SciTech Editor
The worst hack in 
Facebook’s history began 
on Sunday, Sept. 16. 
Security engineers detected 
unusual activity within the 
company’s systems, but it 
took days before they had a 
full explanation. Attackers 
exploited a vulnerability 
to gain full access to the 
accounts of over 50 million 
users, including connected 
applications such as 
Instagram and WhatsApp. 
Facebook discovered the 
extent of the breach on 
Sept. 25 and released an 
of?cial security update 
three days later.
It remains unclear who 
the hackers were or what 
exactly they obtained 
from Facebook, but the 
rami?cations could be 
catastrophic. With over 
2.2 billion users, Facebook 
is one of the largest data 
stewards in history, with 
vast stores of personal 
information such as 
birthdays, credit card 
numbers, and geolocation 
history.
More than 90 million 
users were automatically 
logged out of their 
accounts on all devices 
following the attack as 
a safety precaution, and 
while Facebook says it’s 
unnecessary to change 
your email or password, 
the company is being 
cryptic about how they will 
deal with stolen data.
“We’re taking it very 
seriously,” said Facebook 
CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 
a conference call with the 
media. “I’m glad we found 
this, but it de?nitely is an 
issue that this happened in 
the ?rst place.”
According to the of?cial 
security update, the 
vulnerability was in the 
“View As” feature, which 
allows users to temporarily 
view their pro?le from 
the perspective of another 
user. The interface 
contained a composer box 
which incorrectly allowed 
uploading a video while 
in “View As.” During 
the upload, the video 
uploader could generate 
an authentication token 
not for the user performing 
the upload, but for the user 
pro?le being viewed.

SEAN MIN
Junior Staffwriter
As smartphones have 
become more and more 
ubiquitous, researchers 
and the general population 
alike are questioning 
how much screen time is 
healthy for a developing 
child. Many studies have 
investigated the effect of 
screen time on children, 
but a new study released 
on Sept. 26 in The Lancet 
Child & Adolescent Health 
magazine claims to offer 
a more comprehensive 
picture of the impact of the 
amount of screen time on 
sleep, and exercise — and 
how it affects cognition in 
growing children.
This study is one 
component of a ten-year 
longitudinal study called 
the Adolescent Brain 
Cognitive Development 
Study. The study involves 
tracking the cognitive 
development of more than 
7,500 children until 2028. 
The data for the ?rst 4,500 
participants has been 
released; the study has 
released over 30 terabytes 
of data already, which 
has largely served as the 
foundation for the Lancet 
study.
Another key reference 
in the study is the 
recommendations of 
the Canadian 24-Hour 
Movement Guidelines for 
Children and Youth. These 
guidelines were formulated 
by the Canadian Society 
for Exercise Physiology 
(CSEP); they advise that 
children exercise for at 
least 60 minutes a day, 
sleep for at least nine to 
eleven hours a night, and 
only spend a maximum 
of two hours looking at a 
screen. The 4,524 child 
participants who ranged 
from eight to eleven 
years of age were given 
six tests which assessed 
memory, foresight, cognitive 
processing speed, and 
language skills.
The data provides 
support for the hypothesis 
that excessive screen 
time may harm brain 
development, but the 
study evaluates only one 
snapshot in time. Thus, 
experts advise against 
concluding that this is 
generally true until further 
research is completed.
The authors of the 
study nevertheless 
believe the results are 
concerning. Only 37 
percent of the children 
used their smart devices 
for less than two hours 
a day, only 51 percent 
slept uninterrupted for 
the recommended nine to 
eleven hours, and a mere 
18 percent exercised for 
more than an hour. A full 
29 percent of the children 
met none of the guidelines, 
indicating that they were 
on their smart devices 
for too long, slept for too 
little, and exercised too 
little. Only ?ve percent met 
all of the guidelines. The 
children who met all of the 
guidelines scored roughly 
4 percent higher on the 
combined tests than those 
who met none; likewise, 
children who met the 
guidelines for sleep and 
screen time scored roughly 
5.1 percent higher than 
those who met neither 
of them. When taken 
independently, however, 
it appears that neither 
sleep nor physical activity 
signi?cantly affected test 
results. Other covariates 
were taken into account 
which commonly have 
either positive or negative 
associations with global 
cognition — the positive 
covariates include high 
income, education of the 
parents and the child, 
being of white or Asian 
descent, and being in an 
advanced state of puberty, 
while negatively associated 
covariates include high 
body mass index and 
traumatic brain damage.
Additionally, the study 
indicates that children’s 
screen time averages to 
about 3.6 hours a day, far 
above the recommended 
two hours. Although 
researchers cannot def-
initively say whether 
screen time or any other 
activity in itself lowered 
cognitive skills or whether 
one causes another, its 
results are still quite 
valuable in assessing the 
impact of various factors 
on cognition.
The study also shows 
the value of integrative 
studies, since none of 
these factors can be 
assessed independently 
of the others; they 
are all thoroughly 
interconnected, meaning 
that a change in one leads 
to changes in the other 
two. Additionally, the 
study does not account 
at all for what exactly the 
children in the study are 
doing while they are on 
their smart devices.
Some researchers spec-
ulate that there is likely 
a difference in cognitive 
development between a 
child who plays games 
on their computer and 
another who uses it for 
school work and that it 
may, therefore, be safe to 
allow children more screen 
time depending on the 
content.
Joel Barnes, a coauthor, 
disagrees: “We need 
to consider our screen 
habits and screen use 
as well as the rules and 
restrictions that we apply 
to the recreational time 
of children and youth 
because getting no more 
than 2 hours of screen time 
per day — independent 
of screen content — is 
bene?cial to cognition.”
FACEBOOK, from A7
Essentially, anyone with 
a little technical expertise 
could turn on “View As” 
to navigate a user pro?le, 
try to upload a video and 
be granted full access to 
another user’s account. 
That includes Facebook’s 
companion services such as 
Instagram and WhatsApp, 
as well as linked third-
party accounts such as 
Tinder, Airbnb, and Spotify. 
This vulnerability has 
likely been present since 
Facebook introduced the 
video uploader in July 2017.
Facebook said they 
?xed the problem as soon 
as it was discovered, but 
this isn’t the ?rst time 
protected user information 
has slipped Facebook’s 
grasp. More than 40,000 
passwords were stolen in 
an attack earlier this year, 
and, of course, there was 
the revelation in March 
that British ?rm Cambridge 
Analytica had access to 
over 87 million Facebook 
pro?les during the 2016 
United States presidential 
election.
Senator Mark Warner 
(D-Virginia), a vocal critic 
of Facebook, said that the 
recent breach “is another 
sobering indicator that 
Congress needs to step up 
and take action to protect 
the privacy and security 
of social media users. A 
full investigation should 
be swiftly conducted and 
made public so that we 
can understand more 
about what happened.” 
Commissioner of the 
Federal Trade Commission 
Rohit Chopra said in a 
statement that “breaches 
don’t just violate our 
privacy. They create 
enormous risks for our 
economy and national 
security. The cost of 
inaction is growing, and we 
need answers.” In addition, 
although Facebook was 
required to report the attack 
to the Irish Data Protection 
Commission under the 
European Union’s General 
Data Protection Regulation, 
the commission voiced 
strong concerns at the 
vagueness and timing of 
the company’s report.
Regardless of the con-
sequences Facebook will 
face in the coming weeks, 
this attack exhibits how 
volatile cybersecurity can 
be. April Doss, chair of 
cybersecurity at law ?rm 
Saul Ewing, said, “This 
has really shown us that 
because today’s digital 
environment is so complex, 
a compromise on a single 
platform — especially one 
as popular and widespread 
as Facebook — can have 
consequences that are much 
more far-reaching than 
what we can tell in early 
days of the investigation.”

Tartan Fantasy: the contenders begin to pull ahead
MARIKA YANG
Sports Editor
Alas, I have returned to 
the bottom of the scoreboard 
and have been honored with 
the responsibility to write 
the recap of Tartan Fantasy 
League’s Week 4 action. 
Here’s what went down:
TARTAN FANTASY over 
futbol 107.50 to 69.90
In this matchup, 
Photo Editor Lisa Qian’s 
team TARTAN FANTASY 
dominated Visual Editor 
Tracy Le’s team futbol. 
After starting 2–0, Le’s 
team moves to fourth place 
with a 2-2 record, while 
Qian’s team leapfrogs futbol 
to third place with a 3–1 
record.
For another week, 
Houston Texans quarterback 
Deshaun Watson has carried 
Qian’s team TARTAN 
FANTASY. This week was 
no exception, as Watson led 
the team with 375 passing 
yards and two touchdowns 
for 31.10 points. Dallas 
Cowboys running back 
Ezekiel Elliot’s 30.00 points, 
Atlanta Falcons kicker Matt 
Bryant’s 14.00 points, and 
the Texans defense’s 13.00 
points pushed Qian past Le’s 
team despite all her other 
starters scoring in single 
digits.
Le’s team futbol was 
derailed by the fact she didn’t 
update her starting lineup. 
Her two Carolina Panthers 
players, quarterback Cam 
Newton and tight end Greg 
Olsen, were on a bye, and 
Cincinnati Bengals running 
back Joe Mixon is injured. If 
she had started Indianapolis 
Colts quarterback Andrew 
Luck (35.66 points) and 
Chicago Bears running back 
Tarik Cohen (23.40), futbol 
would have had more than 
enough points to win.
Last Manning Standing 
over mmichelle123 127.22 
to 93.78
This week, Publisher 
Caleb Miller’s team Last 
Manning Standing won for a 
3–1 record, and second place 
in the league. Pillbox Editor 
Michelle Madlansacay’s 
team mmichelle123 drops 
to seventh place with a 1–3 
record.
Miller’s team Last 
Manning Standing boasted 
several strong performances 
this week. Leading the 
team was New Orleans 
Saints running back Alvin 
Kamara, who recorded 
134 rushing yards, three 
rushing touchdowns, and 
47 receiving yards for 36.10 
points. The Green Bay 
Packers defense also had 
a stellar week, putting up 
23.00 points.
On Madlansacay’s 
team mmichelle123, a 
31.68 point performance 
from Minnesota Vikings 
quarterback Kirk Cousins 
was let down by the Vi-
kings defense, who had 
-3.00 points, just like in 
the real game. Saints kick-
er Wil Lutz posted a solid 
15.00 points, but the team 
couldn’t overcome weak 
performances from the 
starting running backs, 
Baltimore Ravens’ Alex 
Collins and Tennessee 
Titans’ Derrick Henry, who 
contributed 8.50 and 3.10 
points, respectively.
newz over Slugs 124.60 to 
100.02
In the closest contest of 
the week (which hopefully 
won’t cause any of?ce 
drama), News Editor Nora 
Mattson’s team newz 
came out on top, defeating 
Operations Manager Adam 
Tunnard’s team Slugs. newz 
scored 21.2 percent more 
points than projected to 
move to 3–1 and maintain 
?rst place, while Slugs, now 
2–2, fall to ?fth place.
Mattson’s team newz had 
a great week overall, with 
several starters contributing 
signi?cantly. Detroit Lions 
wide receiver Golden Tate 
led the team with 25.20 
points from 132 yards 
through the air and two 
touchdowns. Texans wide 
receiver DeAndre Hopkins 
followed with 22.90 points 
from 169 yards through the 
air and one touchdown. Los 
Angeles Chargers quarter-
back Philip Rivers ?nished 
with 250 passing yards and 
three touchdowns for 21.70 
points.
On Tunnard’s team 
Slugs, the running backs 
led the way. Melvin Gordon 
of the Chargers ran for 104 
yards and completed seven 
catches for 55 yards and a 
touchdown, totaling 23.90 
points. Kareem Hunt of 
the Kansas City Chiefs had 
similar numbers, with 121 
yards and a touchdown 
on the ground and 54 
receiving yards for 23.50 
points. Excluding Packers 
quarterback Aaron Rodgers’ 
mediocre 15.02 points, all 
other offensive starts scored 
less than six points, holding 
the team down.
Pillbox over Gin and Bear 
It 107.56 to 56.74
Let’s not sugarcoat it: 
my team Gin and Bear It 
took a beating this week, 
losing to Pillbox Editor Izzy 
Sio’s team Pillbox by 50.82 
points, the highest margin 
this season so far. I’m all 
but ready to revoke my title 
as Sports Editor, but I fear 
most of this is luck (and my 
ineptitude). Sio gets her ?rst 
win of the season and both 
of our teams are tied at 1–3 
and at sixth place.
Sio was smart to pick 
up the red-hot Chiefs 
quarterback Patrick 
Mahomes a couple weeks 
ago. This week, his 22.86 
points from 304 passing 
yards and two touchdowns 
were a team high, followed 
closely by Los Angeles Rams 
running back Todd Gurley’s 
21.60 points from 156 
yards from scrimmage and 
a touchdown. Ravens wide 
receiver John Brown also 
had a great week with 17.90 
points, his most so far this 
season.
Only two of my starters 
scored in the double digits, 
one of which was my ever-
reliable kicker, Justin Tucker 
of the Ravens, who scored 
the second-most points with 
14.00. The only offensive 
player with a decent week 
was Oakland Raiders 
running back Marshawn 
Lynch, who recorded 15.70 
points from 130 rushing 
yards and 27 receiving 
yards. Everyone else let me 
down.
Next week, Miller’s 
team Last Manning 
Standing takes on Qian’s 
team TARTAN FANTASY, 
Tunnard’s team Slugs will 
battle Madlansacay’s team 
mmichelle123, Sio’s team 
Pillbox will face off against 
league leader Mattson’s 
team newz, and Le’s team 
futbol will probably beat my 
team Gin and Bear It.
PENGUINS, from A10
Guentzel got just enough 
on it to sneak the puck right 
between Holtby’s legs. I’m 
expecting big things from 
Guentzel this year.
Derrick Brassard got 
on the board on Thursday 
as well. He jumped on a 
loose puck created by a 
Dominik Simon slapshot, 
then backhanded right past 
Holtby before he knew what 
to do. It’s good to see big 
game Brass get a goal early. 
It should help that third line 
be con?dent through the 
whole season.
In the third, Malkin put 
the Pens up by two goals 
on the power play. Phil 
Kessel fought off some 
strong checking by Caps 
defenders, then passed it 
off to Crosby below the 
goal line, who made a pass 
to Letang at the left circle, 
who one-touched it right 
into Malkin’s wheelhouse, 
who slapped it right past 
the diving Washington 
goaltender. Precision 
passing clinics like this one 
are going to be a common 
sight this year, I’m sure.
The Capitals came back, 
though. An ill-advised 
pass in the Pens defensive 
zone led to an immediate 
turnover by T.J. Oshie, who 
?red a little chip shot right 
past the glove of Murray. 
He then tied the game mo-
ments later on a beautiful 
de?ection. Neither of these 
goals were Murray’s fault. 
He looked poised, but the 
defense collapsed and made 
some big mistakes at the 
end of the game.
Everything was ?ne, 
though, because everyone 
knows that 3 vs. 3 overtime 
gives the Penguins a huge 
advantage, as they can put 
out the stars and let them 
work over whatever their 
opponent wants to put out. 
Crosby worked hard behind 
the net and drew a slashing 
penalty, which gave the 
Pens a fourth man to work 
with against the Capitals’ 
3. After that, it was over. 
Kessel passed to Letang at 
the point, Letang sent it 
over to Malkin who looked 
ready to one-time it past 
Holtby but elected to pass it 
back to Letang instead, who 
ripped the one-timer and 
sent everyone home happy.
The Pens looked sloppy 
on opening night, but 
they’ve shown that their 
offense can still score and 
that they can roll their lines 
signi?cantly better than last 
season. Watch out, folks. 
The Penguins are back.

Two seasons ago, the 
Pittsburgh Penguins and 
Washington Capitals met 
in January. The Penguins 
scored six goals in the 
second period and one 
in the third, with Evgeni 
Malkin racking up a hat-
trick. It had all the makings 
of a blowout, but the 
Capitals had a nearly equal 
offensive output that night, 
racking up seven goals of 
their own over the three 
periods of play. Then, a 
winger for the Pens, Connor 
Sheary, scored the game-
winner in overtime to give 
the Penguins the extra 
point in the standings.
Opening night in PPG 
Paints Arena (the paint 
can, as some call it) was 
a similar game to the one 
played in Jan. 2017. The 
Penguins met the Capitals, 
the reigning Stanley Cup 
champions, and wanted 
to send a message that 
the aging Pittsburgh core 
wasn’t done ?ghting for 
Stanley Cups just yet. The 
Pens opened the scoring in 
the ?rst, with defenseman 
Jamie Oleksiak scoring the 
?rst goal of the 2018-19 
Pens season on a nice 
cycling play by the Hagelin-
Malkin-Kessel line.
Washington responded 
quickly, however, with 
Jakub Vrana scoring from 
the slot on a nice passing 
play. They kept the pressure 
on and went up 2-1 on a 
Brooks Orpik slapshot that 
just snuck through Matt 
Murray’s ?ve-hole. After 
the game, Murray said, “I 
feel like my pants were a 
little open. I was all over 
it. I guess that’s the new 
pants.”
Last season, the 
Penguins’ power play was 
the best in the league, 
and the best in Pittsburgh 
history, scoring 26.2 
percent of the time. It 
showed on Thursday night, 
as the Penguins responded 
and tied the game back up 
at 2 on a Jake Guentzel 
power-play goal. He 
slammed home a partially 
blocked shot that Daniel 
Sprong took from the slot. 
Justin Schultz snuck a pass 
through two defenders 
to Sprong, whose shot 
was tipped right onto 
Guentzel’s tape, letting him 
slam home the easy goal.
The other theme from 
last year was rough de-
fense, and it showed on an 
Alex Ovechkin goal where 
he slipped past Kris Letang, 
stopped right in front of 
the night, and redirected 
a Christian Djoos shot to 
pass through the legs of 
Murray. Nobody picked 
up Ovechkin and he had 
all the time in the world to 
score.
The second period 
looked signi?cantly better 
on the Pens’ end. Kris 
Letang made up for his 
mistake in the ?rst with a 
half slapshot goal thirty 
seconds into the second 
period. He took a nice 
backhand pass from Sidney 
Crosby, who looked like he 
was shot out of a cannon 
to start the shift, and 
slammed it home past Caps 
goaltender Braden Holtby.
Just three minutes later, 
Washington responded 
again. This time it was John 
Carlson who took the puck 
into the zone and right to 
the net, then ?red a wrist 
shot right past the glove 
hand of Murray. His glove 
has looked a bit better, but 
man, it’s just not good. 
There’s no denying that it’s 
his weak spot.
Guentzel took care of 
retying the game at 4 with 
an insane de?ection goal 
on a Schultz wrist shot from 
the right point. Schultz was 
looking for a stick, and he 
found Guentzel’s.

Last week, well-
respected German news 
outlet Der Spiegel dropped 
a stunning headline: “The 
Woman Who Accuses 
Ronaldo of Rape.” In 
light of the past year 
of allegations against 
powerful men in various 
industries, this is sadly 
not a shocking headline, 
but it is shaking soccer 
fans across Europe and 
around the world to their 
core. Der Spiegel’s report 
is an in-depth account of 
the events in June 2009; 
there are communications 
between Cristiano Ronaldo 
and his lawyer, first-hand 
accounts from Kathryn 
Mayorga, the titular 
woman, and quotes from 
the police report filed after 
the incident nine years ago. 
There is even record of a 
$375,000 settlement from 
Ronaldo to Mayorga a few 
months after he allegedly 
raped her in his penthouse 
in Las Vegas.
On the next day, 
Mayorga filed a police 
report in Las Vegas that 
recounted the horrifying 
experience: Ronaldo 
himself is reported as 
understanding her pleas 
to stop multiple times, 
which is the least insidious 
aspect of Der Spiegel’s 
report on the case. The 
police took DNA evidence, 
a statement from Mayorga, 
and cataloged her 
injuries, which included 
bruising to her rectum. A 
demeaning police officer 
— who reportedly said, 
“You getting an attorney, 
that doesn’t look good” — 
took her statement, and 
by the end of it, she asked 
the officer to do nothing. 
A criminal case was 
never opened, but a civil 
agreement was arranged 
between Mayorga’s and 
Ronaldo’s lawyers in the 
early winter of the next 
year. Mayorga was paid 
$375,000 — a week of 
Ronaldo’s wages — on the 
condition of her silence. 
Ronaldo didn’t even show 
up to the arbitration 
meeting.
Nine years later, on Sept. 
27, the criminal case was 
reopened by the Las Vegas 
Police Department on 
account of Mayorga filing 
a lawsuit against Ronaldo 
with rejuvenated strength 
and willingness to testify, 
and thanks to Nevada’s 
statute of limitations law, 
the criminal case will 
be allowed to progress 
as the assault was docu-
mented the same night as 
it occurred. For his part, 
Ronaldo responded in an 
Instagram Live video that 
the allegations were “fake 
news.” It’s unlikely for 
there to be more news on 
the front of a criminal case 
against Ronaldo until the 
investigation starts to wind 
down.
However, one thing 
about these allegations 
against Ronaldo that draws 
a stark difference between 
allegations against former 
Hollywood producer 
Harvey Weinstein, newly 
confirmed Supreme Court 
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, 
or other powerful men 
of industry is the lack of 
general social outrage 
that is so common of the 
#MeToo movement; I’ve 
found myself telling more 
people about Ronaldo’s 
allegations than not. 
With the confirmation 
of Kavanaugh and a 
tempering outrage around 
Ronaldo, the #MeToo 
movement is approaching 
its moment of reckoning.
There is a long history 
of sexual assaults in sports, 
but the male-dominated 
industry has often swept 
these serious allegations 
under the carpet while 
the accused continue to 
make millions and bask 
in fame. In 2003, Kobe 
Bryant was accused of 
raping a 19-year-old hotel 
employee and settled with 
the accuser out of court. 
He continued his storied 
NBA career for 13 more 
years, is still one of the 
most revered basketball 
players ever, and earlier 
this year won an Academy 
Award. While there is still 
discourse about these 
events of Bryant’s past, it 
are often to remind people 
of them.
The industries the 
#MeToo movement is 
fighting are not just 
the supposed liberal 
havens of Hollywood, 
but the male-dominated 
bastions of athletics and 
politics, among others. 
What is the future of the 
movement if we can change 
ourselves, but not them?
A wise person once told 
me that we want evil to 
take an unordinary shape. 
We want to believe aliens 
will destroy the world, or 
that there’s a meteor that 
will turn the world into 
some sort of ectoplasmic 
mush. We don’t want to 
believe that extraordinary 
evil can take an ordinary 
shape — our shape.
The hard work of the 
#MeToo movement is yet 
to come. There will be a 
reckoning for the powerful 
men in these male 
bastions. There will be a 
reckoning for the athletes, 
the politicians, the CEOs. 
There will be a reckoning 
for the 17-year-old boys 
with immense wealth 
and future prosperity: 
the Ronaldos and the 
Kavanaughs. But first, 
#MeToo must reckon 
with its own diminishing 
returns, and we as a society 
must reckon with what we 
choose to see and what we 
choose to ignore. A choice 
is coming, and the good 
fight must be fought. Let 
us hope it starts with some 
good news, come the next 
few months.
Will #MeToo have a voice in sports?

International soccer star Cristianto Ronaldo faces rape allegations from a June 2009 night in Las Vegas.

On Saturday, Oct. 6, the 
Carnegie Mellon University 
men’s and women’s soccer 
teams competed in a 
doubleheader of soccer 
games against Brandeis 
University, with the men’s 
team going ?rst at 11 a.m., 
and the women’s team 
following at 1:30 p.m. 
Unfortunately, each team 
lost to Brandeis by a score of 
1–0 and 2–0, respectively. 
Each game was a tough 
matchup for Tartan’s soccer, 
especially the women’s 
side, which featured a 10th 
ranked Brandeis team and a 
12th ranked Tartan squad.
For a bright and early 
start, the men kicked things 
off quickly — a yellow 
card was given in the ?rst 
?fteen minutes of the game 
to Brandeis, and another 
followed less than ?ve 
minutes later. That was the 
story of the game, though. 
An absurd total of 11 
yellow cards were handed 
out at random intervals 
throughout the game, 
but predominantly, in the 
second half. The coaches for 
both teams earned a yellow 
card, too.
As for the single goal 
in the game, it came with 
about ten minutes left in 
the ?rst half, with Brandeis 
dribbling into open space 
just outside the box and 
letting one ?y into the 
back of the night. Tartan 
goalkeeper Alec Lam made 
four saves in just the ?rst 
half, but he couldn’t get to 
this one. For the rest of the 
game, the Tartans pushed 
into Brandeis territory, 
offering seven shots, with 
three on goal, to zero shots 
by Brandeis in the second 
half. Brandeis decided to 
slow their attack after the 
?rst goal to prevent the 
Tartans from mounting any 
meaningful attack in the 
second half, and it worked; 
no Tartan goals and only 3 
saves were forced into the 
Brandeis keeper’s hands. 
The three shots on goal 
came from Tartan attacker 
Anthony Gulli, and the only 
other shot on goal was from 
the foot of Alex Dziadosz.
Overall, a lackluster 
performance by the Tartans 
in the ?rst half only hurt 
them later in the game, 
as the Brandeis defense 
proved to be too much for 
the Tartans to handle.
Now came the women’s 
team, but not before the 
iconic Pittsburgh pop-up 
rainstorm forced the game 
back to a mid-afternoon 
start-time. In starkly 
opposing fashion, no yellow 
cards were handed out in 
the women’s game; maybe 
the postponement gave the 
teams time to be amicable 
towards each other. This 
time, the stats of the game 
stayed fairly consistent 
through the halves: the 
Tartans had three shots in 
each half to Brandeis’s ?ve. 
Two saves were made by 
each keeper in the second 
half, and in the ?rst, Tartan 
keeper Carolyn Botz made 
three saves to the Brandeis 
keeper’s one. However, this 
meant that the Brandeis 
team placed an unrelenting 
pressure on the Tartan 
defense, which only broke 
down once to allow a goal 
by Brandeis from 18 yards 
out that caromed off the 
post and into the net. The 
other Brandeis goal was a 
blast from 25 yards out that 
sailed over Botz’s head and 
into the top netting.
All in all, a mostly even 
game was played, but there 
were signs that Brandeis 
would eventually break 
through. They did, but 
only a small span of ten 
minutes from the 51st to 
the 61st minutes was the 
only breakdown for a solid 
Tartan team.
Looking ahead, the men’s 
soccer team has a stretch of 
home games through the 
middle of October that are 
must-wins in conference 
play. The team is 8–1–2 so 
far, and they have a real 
shot at being a dark horse 
contender in playoffs. The 
same is true of the women’s 
team, but they are a higher 
ranked team in the polls so 
far. Their record is 7–3–1, 
with their only losses 
coming from teams that are 
higher ranked than them, 
but a loss to New York Uni-
versity is going to re?ect 
poorly in future polls. The 
teams face the University of 
Chicago next Friday, Oct. 12 
in another doubleheader.

Dear Michelle,
These past few weeks have probably been the 
most stressful of the year for me, and I’m ready 
to pass out. I’ve had to deal with job applications 
and interviews, midterms, and lots of homework 
(still!). I haven’t really found time for myself, but 
I have been able to spend a little bit of time with 
my friends. And yet, even when I hang out with 
them I don’t feel my happiest because I still have 
all my worries about school and jobs in the back 
of my mind. I don’t know what to do - I want to be 
happy with both my friends and myself, but I feel 
like all the stress from school has basically taken 
over my life. Please give me some advice on how 
to deal with this.
Starting To Realize Even School Sometimes Is
Not Great
Dear STRESSING,
There’s always a point in the semester when the 
work and stress hit you all at once, and everything 
in your life seems to be falling apart. And the only 
way you think you can deal with this is to devote 
all your time and energy into your work. Please 
know that this approach to work in college isn’t 
uncommon and that so many people are feeling 
and doing the exact same things. Especially at our 
school, there are lots students who let their work 
consume their entire lives. Know that your life in 
college doesn’t have to be like this, even though 
it may seem like it’s that way for everyone else 
around you. Your work is important, your health is 
just as (if not more) important.
What can help is to catch yourself at the moment 
when you start to feel like you’re not yourself and 
you’re not happy. Once you’ve done that, just stop 
and take a deep breath. Think about the things 
that make you most happy, and even write them 
down if want! The idea here is that you should take 
time to reflect on your priorities and how you want 
to mentally move forward; you need to make sure 
that the next steps you take will not lead you to 
eventually burn out. After doing this, try gradually 
setting aside time each week to do the things that 
really make you happy. We all need that constant 
reminder that our work does not define us and 
that in the end, our true goal is to be happy and 
satisfied with our life. Be sure to keep that in mind.
Hope this helps!
Michelle
  Izzy Sio | Pillbox EditorBrunch Buddies: Pamela’s P&G Diner
It only took about a month of restraint – or 
agonized waiting, however you want to phrase 
it – before I finally got to go to Pamela’s Diner, 
a Pittsburgh staple, for the first time this semester. 
While it is definitely not The Tartan’s first time 
talking about Pamela’s, here’s a first-hand 
experience reminding you why visiting this diner is 
must during your time at Carnegie Mellon.
The location: Pamela’s P&G Diner has several 
locations throughout Pittsburgh. There’s a Pamela’s 
in Shadyside, Oakland, and in the Strip District. My 
friend and I elected to go to the Pamela’s in Squirrel 
Hill. It’s one of the first restaurants you see when 
you turn on Murray Street, and we could already 
see people gathered around the door at 10:30 a.m. 
Despite this, we were seated fairly quickly – a diner 
that’s been around for almost 40 years knows how 
to deal with the morning rush.
The food: Pamela’s crepe-style hotcakes, which my 
friend and I both ordered, are the must-try dish of 
almost any Pamela’s visit. You can choose to get 
a stack of two or three pancakes, but no matter 
how many pancakes you order they are extremely 
filling. They’re thin, crunchy, warm, and one of the 
restaurant chain’s staples. We also ordered a side 
of Pamela’s famous Lyonnaise potatoes. They were 
piping hot when they arrived, but we both couldn’t 
help but dig in immediately. The potatoes have a 
great crunch to them, and they’re something that I’ll 
almost always order whenever I go to Pamela’s.
The vibe: The restaurant was packed with all groups 
of people: families, college students, teenagers, a 
group of old men hanging out for brunch. It created 
an interesting, refreshing dynamic that captured the 
spirit of a small town, even though Pittsburgh is far 
from that. Pamela’s staff was incredibly friendly, 
making sure our order went through and it felt like 
I was in good hands. In Pamela’s it was so easy to 
relax and slip into a conversation with my friend 
amid the morning activity of the restaurant.
Lit or Nah:  Pamela’s in the morning is vibrant and 
lively no matter which location you go to. It’s a 
great place to start your morning off right and an 
even better place to go with the company of great 
friends.
If you haven’t been here, do it now.

SHANE DAWSON, 
YouTube is not exactly the irst place you’d go to see 
an in-depth multi-part investigative series, but one of the 
platform’s famous personalities, Shane Dawson, has 
carved out a space to create just that. Originally known 
for his sketches, conspiracy theory videos, and raunchy 
content, Dawson has since completely rebranded his 
public image and re-invented himself, aiming for more 
emotionally impactful, exciting, and dramatic videos. 
He now creates episodic investigative “docu-series,” 
interviewing controversial popular igures like makeup 
tycoon Jeffree Star, comedian Kathy Grifin, and fellow 
YouTuber Tana Mongeau --- often taking the stance of 
an empathetic friend rather than an objective interview-
er. Usually following a scandal in which his subject is 
involved, Dawson aims to dig deeper into the lives of his 
subjects to ind out their true natures and motivations. 
Due to his own popularity and the popularity of his 
subjects, Dawson’s channel was re-launched into the 
public eye, easily drawing in over 10 million views per 
video. However, his most recent subject – vlogger and 
former Disney star Jake Paul – has raised some serious 
concerns about misrepresentation and dramatization.
Dawson’s latest – and currently ongoing – series, “The 
Mind of Jake Paul,” was more than highly anticipated; 
the massive success of his previous docuseries has guar-
anteed that everyone in the YouTube community will be 
on the edge of their seat for his next set of videos – a 
fact proven by the over 8 million views he received 
on the teaser trailer alone. What makes this particular 
docuseries unique are his subjects: Jake Paul and his 
older brother Logan. The Paul brothers are infamous for 
their scandals and insane, insensitive behavior. Logan’s 
vlog displaying a dead body in Japan’s suicide forest 
received an enormous amount of backlash, but with little 
consequences – in fact, he continues to gain millions of 
views every day. Similarly, Jake’s nearly life-threatening 
pranks and suspicious business practices have cost him 
his contract with Disney, yet he too continues to rope 
in millions of views. One of the most dangerous side 
effects of this behavior – aside from the danger to them-
selves and their immediate friends – is the impression 
they leave on their viewers, who tend to be around the 
ages of 7-14.
The Paul brothers’ pasts left many uneasy when Dawson 
initially announced “The Mind of Jake Paul,” as many 
refused to give the Paul brothers the watch time and 
an even bigger platform. Much of Dawson’s audience, 
easily in the millions, were worried that his series would 
redeem and create undeserved sympathy for the Paul 
brothers, a critique that commonly appears on Daw-
son’s other series as well. Viewers were made even 
more uneasy when he announced that the main question 
he aims to solve was: “Is Jake Paul a sociopath?” Em-
phasized with his trademark creepy music and distort-
ed text, the series seems to try to explain Jake Paul’s 
behavior as rooted in a serious personality disorder.
Today, YouTubers are known to dramatize things for the 
sake of connecting with a larger viewership – faking 
pranks, blowing events out of proportion, and creating 
clickbait titles and thumbnails for their videos. Drama-
tizing everyday events is how many YouTubers create 
their content, and it has become a sort of unspoken 
necessary strategy to amassing audiences similar in size 
to Dawson’s or the Paul brothers’. But this becomes a 
serious issue when the thing content creators are drama-
tizing is mental health.

Dawson clearly aims to be objective while still entertaining, but that balance seemed to teeter closer to “drama for the sake of entertain-
ment” than he perhaps originally intended. Part 2 of his series, where he investigates the potential psychological aspects of Jake Paul’s 
personality, received intense backlash for his representation of personality disorders. The video, which featured YouTuber and licensed 
therapist Kati Morton, was focused on a discussion of what sociopathy is and what behaviors it could entail. Despite not having met Jake 
Paul in person, Dawson attempts to allude to him being a sociopath, even going as far as to suggest that there must be something inher-
ently sociopathic about YouTubers for them to behave so erratically. While the video sheds light on an interesting conversation about 
what people are willing to do for internet popularity, the editing style seems to diagnose certain YouTubers’ behavior as sociopathic 
(Morton tells Dawson that sociopaths imitate emotions like sadness to seem “normal,” then the video cuts to beauty YouTuber Laura Lee 
crying on camera).
While Logan Paul’s description of sociopathy isn’t much better ---- “A sociopath is just someone who’s more savage” ---- Dawson and 
Morton fail to provide any deinitive deinition, almost purposefully leaving it vague for dramatic effect. What they also fail to mention is 
that sociopathy, like many other mental illnesses, is rooted in behaviors that everyone 
has. For example, depression: everyone experiences sadness, but depression can 
be a much more intense and debilitating condition. As 
a result, Dawson and Morton outright say that “1 
in 25 people are sociopaths,” for shock value. 
It takes advantage of the fear people have 
towards sociopaths, and the video continues to 
paint sociopaths as “evil” and “gross.” While 
the conversation may have been casual, it’s 
beyond wrong for a licensed therapist to call 
someone with a serious disorder “gross.” 
It’s a personality disorder, and it doesn’t 
inherently make someone evil or mean-spirit-
ed. Whether this manipulation is purposeful 
or not, it dehumanizes and stigmatizes 
people with personality disorders, which 
is so incredibly dangerous considering the 
enormous audience watching these videos.
After seeing the backlash on his video, 
Dawson commented: “Once again I’m 
100% NOT trying to call any celeb or 
Youtuber a ‘sociopath’. I just wanted to 
give example clips to go along with 
me and Kati’s conversation to 
make for an entertaining vid-
eo.” He recently announced 
that he’ll be re-ilming parts 
of the upcoming videos to 
make them less dramatized, 
but only time will tell.

If you don’t live under a rock, you know Jeffree Star as either 
the highly successful makeup artist on YouTube, the entrepreneur 
who runs his own makeup brand, or the guy on the 
very viral Shane Dawson “docu-series.” He has 
been in the YouTube makeup game since 2015, 
building his career from the ground up, and 
now enjoying the fruits of his labor: Gucci 
clothes, Barbie pink everything, and 
endless cars. However, time and time 
again, his career has been tainted 
with accusations of racism discomfort-
ing enough to keep a community of 
wary YouTubers and makeup artists 
away from him and his products, but 
subtle or old enough to keep an 
entire audience of ten million 
subscribers wrapped around his 
manicured finger.
Jeffree Star has, inevitably, 
responded to his past–even if 
it took over two years to do 
so. Videos of him saying the 
n-word to women and por-
traying stereotypes on 
MySpace came to 
light just as his fame 
skyrocketed, caus-
ing many YouTubers 
and subscribers alike 
to stay away from 
him. Finally, in June 
2017, Jeffree Star 
ended his silence and 
released a full apology 
video, appropriately 
titled “RACISM.” He described 
the now-thirteen-year-old videos as “disgust-
ing, vile, nasty, and embarrassing things,” and went on 
to bring an argument he still uses today: he was depressed 
and “angry at the world,” and saying those derogatory words 
was something he would never do today.
Flash forward to about two weeks ago when Star’s former hair 
stylist, Daved Anthony Munoz, shared a video of him expos-
ing conversations between him and Star. Munoz expressed how 
sorry he is for his own past, as he scrolled through the texts from 
2017–the same year as the apology video–which show Star 
calling fellow YouTuber Jackie Aina slurs, including the n-word. 
Furthermore, earlier this week, Star wore cornrows for a holiday 
shoot, prompting more accusations of racism and cultural 
insensitivity.
So why isn’t he “over” or “cancelled?” He is 
yet to acknowledge Aina’s open letter call-
ing out his racist behavior, only turning to 
his Snapchat followers to shade Munoz 
for being a liar. Yet other makeup art-
ists under the same boat such as Laura 
Lee, for example, have (rightfully) lost 
many fans and fame. In Lee’s case, 
she lost well over 500,000 subscribers 
when her racist tweets from 2012 were 
resurfaced, and her subpar apology 
video was criticized for lacking real 
empathy and emotions. Her tweets 
were simply inexcusable, telling black 
people to “pull ur pants up [so] you 
can run from the police faster #your-
welcome,” costing her sponsorships and 
collaborations from Ulta, Colourpop, and 
Morphe Brushes.
It is only a slight surprise 
to learn, however, that 
Morphe is the only 
retailer to sell Jeffree 
Star’s makeup line. 
Morphe has shown 
unwavering support, 
parading him at every 
one of their new U.S. 
store grand openings. If 
the brand was so quick to drop 
Laura Lee, what is holding them back 
from Star? It is the fact that we are all turning our heads the 
other way; it is the fact that he has never been truly held account-
able; it is the fact that Star strategically released his docu-series 
with Shane Dawson, sharing “his truth.”
I am convinced that Star, while sorry, is sorry for the wrong rea-
sons. He was sorry that he was caught–not for bringing down 
black women and disrespecting black culture. Aina brought up an 
excellent point in her open letter: “If there’s going to be a stan-
dard, let’s raise it for everyone. Let’s stop making exceptions for 
people just because we like the way they blend their eyeshadow.”

Pink Floyd ’s The Wall: 
An Experiment in Surrealism
Anyone familiar with Pink Floyd’s discography 
will be well versed with the band’s fascination 
with the human condition. This includes the 
demons that accompany fame, and their love 
for creating metaphorical songs and concept 
albums. The Wall, their 1979 release (and 
last great album), is the epitome of these traits 
that characterized a number of their songs 
and releases, and it spawned a cult classic ilm 
adaptation in 1982 written by the band’s main 
songwriter and bassist, Roger Waters.
The narrative of The Wall follows a jaded rock-
star named Pink, who in many ways is a rep-
resentation of Waters, as well as Syd Barrett, 
one of the founding members of the band who 
left at the very start of their career. The story 
is about Pink’s isolation. which is represented 
by a metaphorical wall that is constantly being 
built over time by different people and events 
in his life such as the death of his father, his 
overprotective mother, his abusive teachers, 
and his tumultuous life as a successful 
rockstar with marriage and drug 
problems.
Both the album and ilm are 
experiments in surrealism. With 
surrealism, what you see is 
never what it seems to be, 
rather it is a representation 
of something more vis-
ceral- an indescribable, 
overwhelming feeling 
that takes you over.
The album takes 
advantage of its soundscape and the ilm takes 
advantage of its visual presentation to create 
this desired overwhelming feeling, and the 
band is able to say much more and strike a 
deeper nerve than any words possibly could.
The soundscape is illed with reverb and 
airiness, which is simultaneously relaxing and 
oppressive. It’s a common trait of Pink Floyd’s 
sound, but The Wall takes advantage of this for 
the narrative. With each song, there is a con-
stant feeling of claustrophobia, like walls are 
closing in, which helps the listener understand 
the mental state of Pink. An example of this 
is one of the band’s most iconic songs, “Com-
fortably Numb.” At this point in the narrative, 
Pink is heavily medicated and his putting on a 
show while incredibly high. Pink needs drugs to 
give him any sense of freedom, which ironically 
shows how trapped he is by the mental wall 
he has built for him-self all of his life. The 
song sounds like something comforting 
and inviting, but as it crescendos to 
an incredible guitar solo at the 
end, there is a sort of 
existential oppression 
that the song gets 
at.
The band also samples random sounds through-
out several of their songs. This is another staple 
in Pink Floyd’s style, but it is used for excellent 
narrative effect here. From sampling teachers 
screaming at kids in “Another Brick in the Wall, 
Pt. 2” to a child exclaiming to his mother about 
an airplane in the sky in “Goodbye Blue Sky,” 
the effect it creates is that of random hallucina-
tions or memories. It is an auditory represen-
tation of how the protagonist is affected by his 
memories, which can sort of come and go at 
any moment, or can be enhanced via drug use. 
It’s part of the organized sound that character-
izes the album built with very speciic pieces, 
similar to how Pink its the pieces of his  
metaphorical wall.
The ilm takes the surrealism a step further in 
the visual department by switching between 
powerful animation and imagery, elevating the 
lyrics of speciically chosen songs on the album. 
There is one scene in the ilm, which adapts 
the lyrics of “In the Flesh” and “Run Like Hell,” 
where Pink hallucinates himself as a Nazi-like 
dictator ordering his audience to attack ethnic 
minorities. Both the songs and lyrics seem to 
have nothing to do with anything meaningful 
at all, but that simple scene is able to say so 
much. On one level, it shows just how Pink had 
effectively lost touch of reality at this point. On 
another level, this sequence showed contempt 
for celebrity culture and blind celebrity 
worship. Despite all of Pink’s very public 
laws, the audience sticks by him through 
thick and thin, like members of a cult 
or, as the ilm depicted, followers of a 
fascist dictator. In Pink’s mind, he could 
tell them to do anything, and they’d 
do it, even attacking minorities, as 
he commanded the audience to do. 
The ilm is peppered with moments 
like this that build on the original 
album so well. One of the most 
iconic images that is shown 
is a picture of animated 
marching hammers, which 
symbolize how in order 
for Pink to truly ever 
feel free, he has to 
inevitably break the mental wall he has built 
around himself.
Surrealism, when done incorrectly, comes off 
as pretentious and stale. However, clearly 
The Wall, both the album and ilm, does it so 
well, which makes this and other prior Pink 
Floyd albums iconic. The band gives listeners a 
cathartic experience in the album. By the end, 
if you really listen to all the songs or watch 
the ilm closely, you’ll be drained in the best 
possible way.

 The Hot Seat  
Tucked away at the corner of Margeret Morrison and Forbes, the Frame Gallery sat awaiting a lood of 
visitors for the opening of their irst show of the year, “the Hot Seat”. The Frame, a nonproit, student run art 
gallery situated at the corner of campus, presents a space for creatives within the campus community to apply 
for the opportunity to exhibit their work. On this particular night, Senior Fine Art students Sarah Kim and 
Grace Simmons premiere their collaborative work in their show, “the Hot Seat,” a combination of work made 
separately and jointly investigating the “subject” in multiple ways. When describing it, the artists write that 
“‘the Hot Seat’ invites viewers to contemplate the passions and concerns of a nebulous group of strangers; 
their only commonality being their location (Schenley Park) and their agreement to talk on camera.” Through 
the exploration of these individuals and their tennuous connections in the environment that unites them, the 
work manages to become both individually speciic and instantly relatable to the people experiencing a sepa-
rate commonality viewing it. “The Hot Seat” is an extraordinary show that allows us a moment of relection to 
ponder our place in these environments and the moments that create our experience. 8

If you’re an avid gamer like me, then you’re probably excited about the lineup of upcoming games, including titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, Assassin’s 
Creed Odyssey, Fallout 76, and Anthem. The great thing about video games is that they get better and better over time as the requisite technology improves 
to better support the artistic visions of game developers. This is evident when we look at the evolution of franchises, such as how the Elder Scrolls series 
received a dramatic overhaul from Oblivion to Skyrim, or how much the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games have changed from the time of GTA San Andreas to 
the time of GTA V.
It seems that with each new game the titles become more realistic and lifelike in their narratives, their graphics, and their mechanics, which is generally a 
good thing. And with the development of new and improved graphics cards, like the Nvidia GTX 2080 and the AMD Radeon RX series, gaming at 60 fps 
with 4k resolution at high graphics settings is slowly becoming the standard among serious gamers.
But can a video game ever become too realistic?
This has been a serious concern since the beginning, and many have decried video game violence as a gateway to real-life violence, especially in the wake 
of tragic events like mass shootings. While there is substantial evidence showing that video games do not correlate to people acting on their violent impulses, 
that conclusion may have to be revisited.
For the most part, one of the key reasons why video game violence is passable is because the settings and characters do not directly mirror the real world. 
Even in GTA, the characters that you encounter and the mechanics of the game are so over-the-top and outrageous that it dilutes the realism of your more 
heinous acts. The same goes for fighting games such as Mortal Kombat, which is famous for its visceral finishing moves, or role-playing games like Shadow 
of Mordor and the Witcher series.
However, there are video games that do cross the line. For example, a little-known game called Hatred, released in 2015, was harshly criticized for its 
premise and its animations. The entire purpose of the game was to play as a psychopathic murderer and kill as many human beings as possible. Despite the 
isometric perspective, drab color scheme, and painfully one-dimensional plot, the main problem was the game’s violence: the player was equipped with a full 
arsenal of realistic weaponry, the targets were all non-hostile civilians, and the “execution” moves were gruesome, to say the least.
Hatred met a lot of backlash because it showcased its violence in a way that was too realistic, hinting at something that could conceivably happen in the real 
world. This raises concerns about the potential of the same thing happening again, where it would be significantly worse now given how sharply rendered 
graphics and advanced physics engines only contribute to the gruesomeness.
People are generally sensible about the boundary between virtual and physical reality, but as video games become increasingly complex and more 
intricately detailed, the ability to form that distinction may blur. This is even more dangerous when you consider the advances made in VR technology, with 
games like Skyrim VR showcasing the ability of these platforms to give players a whole new level of immersion. It’s not inconceivable to say that all of 
us may one day live within the world of Ready Player One, where everyone and their mother has access to a headset and peripherals, allowing them to 
indulge in a completely encompassing virtual reality.
For now, it seems that video game developers are leveraging their newfound technological capabilities in a good way, designing games that give players a 
healthy dose of violence within imaginary contexts rather than breaching into the real world. But it’s important to always keep in mind that the experiences 
we have in these virtual worlds should be constrained to the screen; as long as we’re aware of the potential impacts, video games can continue to be a fun 
and entertaining medium to help us de-stress and blow off some steam.
Happy gaming!
The Dangers of Increasing 
Immersion

Incredibles 2 picks up immediately after the events 
of the first film, with the supers taking on the 
Underminer, who emerged at the very last seconds 
of the previous film. After a disastrous public 
comeback, two business tycoon siblings, Winston 
and Evelyn Deavor, recruit Elastigirl to be the 
new face of the superhero comeback while Mr. 
Incredible has to sit at home and take care of 
the kids.
The film isn’t as good as the first film, but it also isn’t 
trying to be like the first in many ways. Whereas 
The Incredibles was considerably more violent and 
dark, this one takes on the style of a family comedy
featuring superheroes and a neo-futuristic 1960s 
setting. The pacing is incredibly brisk and every 
second of the film is pure glee. The film is nearly 
two hours long, but it feels like an hour. The 
animation is jaw-dropping and gorgeous, with each 
frame packed with so many clever little details and 
every shot composed well. The story is heartwarm-
ing and touching, with a great message about how 
parenting is an act of heroism when done properly.
The best aspect of this film is, of course, the action 
sequences. Each of the new superheroes introduced 
in the film has a wide array of clever powers, 
and they are all used in such fresh and original 
ways, clearly taking advantage of the fact that the 
film is animated to create some of the best action 
sequences in a superhero film ever. If there are any 
gripes, it’s that the villain is considerably lackluster, 
especially considering just how great a character 
Syndrome was in the original film. But Incredibles 
2 is an absolute blast. Take your friends with you, 
laugh and have a good time, and maybe watch 
it twice because you’ll leave the theater wanting 
more.
