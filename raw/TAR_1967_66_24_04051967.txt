Administrators Call 
Deferments Unfair
Both Dr. H. Guyford Stever, president, and Dr. Edward 
Schatz, vice-president for academic affairs, see the present 
draft situation as being unfair. In Tartan interviews with 
Tech administrators, Stever and Schatz, both were concern­
ed with maintaining fairness in any Selective Service Sys­
tem. Stever, in elaborating on this point,said “One of the 
problems in deferring people just because they go to college 
is that it singles out a privileged group. However, the most 
important point is to have a system that is fair, hence the 
lottery system is fairer in the sense that anyone can be 
called to service.
In criticizing the present se­
lective Service System, Stever 
said that the draft board system 
is the wrong way to handle the 
problem. The present system is 
generating hard feelings.
From an educational view­
point, the academic community 
does not reflect accurately the 
attitude of the whole country. 
However, with the exception of 
medical students, Stever sees no 
area that would be drastically or 
irrevocably hurt by an impar­
tial draft. This is especially true, 
he maintains, if the present Viet­
namese conflict ends within the 
next couple of years.
Most Can Manage
His experience after World 
War II indicates that people, in 
general, can reconstruct their 
lives after an interruption, such 
as military service, in any field. 
It is easiest to interrupt one’s 
life at certain points, though, 
such as after high school. For 
this reason, Stever agrees that 
younger people should be draft­
ed first.
“This would preclude the ne­
cessity for specific deferments,” 
Stever stated, “since at 18 or 
19, most young people have not 
decided on a possible career 
field.”
Vice-president Schatz essen­
tially agrees with Stever. 
There are inequities in the 
present draft systenf, and se­
lective service should be made 
fairer than it is. The present 
unfairness is basically due to 
occupational and educational 
deferments.
In commenting on President 
Johnson’s proposals, Schatz said 
he found himself closest to John­
son’s position in this matter, 
especially on the issue of using 
a lottery system to draft young­
er men first. Schatz re-empha­
sized the need for fairness in 
stating “the democratic proces­
ses must be maintained ... we 
cannot play God.”
All Should Serve
While Stever and Schatz feel 
that educational deferments are 
unfair, and that the situation 
where it appears education is 
circumventing any sort of na­
tional service should be avoided, 
Dean Erwin Steinberg, head of 
Margaret Morrison and the Di­
vision of Humanities and Social 
Sciences views the situation dif­
ferently.

Brown Calls Drug Position 
“Corrective”, Not “Punitive”
What is the school’s policy on narcotics? In response to complaints from faculty and 
students regarding the Administration’s silence, Dean George K. Brown, head of the Divi­
sion of Student Affairs clarifies Carnegie Tech’s position on drugs in a statement to 
the Tartan:
“Carnegie has been concerned with the problem of drug use among college students 
for a number of years. Two years ago a special committee to study the problem was ap­
pointed by the Pesident. The committee was asked to gather information about the use 
of drugs and to advise him and the Division of Student Affairs regarding the problem.

April Fool’s Riot ReignsPresident Reorganizes Division of Student Affairs
In a recent reorganization of the Division of Student 
Affairs, Earle Swank was appointed to the newly-formed 
position of Dean of Students. Virginia Milligan, formerly 
Dean of Women, and Eugene Milich, previously Associate 
Dean of Men, were retitled Assistant Deans of Students. 
George K. Brown will continue as head of the Division of 
Student Affairs.
In his organization announce­
ment, President Dr. H. Guyford 
Stever elucidated the responsi­
bilities associated with the new 
positions.
Dean Swank, as Dean of Stu­
dents, will be responsible for 
student activities and will act 
as assistant administrator in the 
division. In addition, the Assis­
tant Deans of Students, the Co­
ordinator of Student Activities, 
and the Coordinators of Religi­
ous Affairs will all report to 
him.
Mrs. Milligan, in her position 
as Assistant Dean of Students, 
will supervise and guide wom­
en’s student affairs, coordinate 
the summer session, and act as 
general assistant. Milich is pri­
marily responsible for supervis­
ing all male student affairs ex­
cept fraternities, aiding foreign 
students, and operating the Fel­
lowship Information Center.
Also Stever noted that the of­
fice of Head of Men’s Housing 
has been replaced by Housing 
Manager, who will be responsi­
ble for both men’s and women’s 
housing. George Tipker, previ­
ously Head of Men’s Housing, 
has been appointed to this posi­
tion.
In addition to the newly form­
ed positions, the following staffs 
are part of the Division of Stu­
dent Affairs: Director of Admis­
sions Kenneth Wenger; Director 
of Athletics Ray Haynes; Direc­
tor of Counseling, Dr. Robert 
Morgan; Director of Financial 
Aid, Peter Nachtweg; Director 
of the Health Department, Dr.
Edward Bamonte; and Regis­
trar William Rogers.
Finally, included in this an­
nouncement was the establish­
ment of a Student Affairs Com­
mittee, to include students and 
faculty members, and to be 
chaired by Dean Brown. Al­
though the details are not com­
pletely finalized, the committee 
will serve as an advisory group 
to the Dean of Student Affairs, 
and will act as a sounding board 
regarding policies and opera­
tions of the division.
Panel to Analyze 
V ietnam Episode
The effect of the Vietnam War 
on the student will be the topic 
of a unique panel discussion to 
be held this evening at 7:30 in 
the GSIA auditorium.
The panel, consisting of col­
lege faculty members will dis­
cuss the following aspects of the 
student as affected by Vietnam: 
the mind, moral values, job op­
portunities, freedoms, draft sta­
tus, and the future.
Panel members are Dr. Daryl 
Bern, psychology; Dr. Sergio De 
Benedetti, physics; Dr. Myron 
Joseph, GSIA; Tom Kerr, head, 
American Civil Liberties Union; 
Dr. Leonard Rapping, GSIA; Dr. 
Eugene McCreary, history, and 
George Baylor, psychology, mod­
erator. The discussion is spon­
sored by the CIT YMCA.
Men Initiate 
Water Battle 
On Morewood
Five Tech students were ar­
rested last Saturday as the aft­
ermath of a giant water-battle 
on Morewood Avenue. Another 
student was hospitalized with 
lacerations of the leg.
The battle started shortly aft­
er noon, when several fraternity 
men began dousing each other 
with water. The action soon 
spread across the street to More­
wood Gardens, where Mrs. Mar­
ian Wilson, a housemother, was 
drenched, as were any women 
attempting to enter or leave 
Morewood.
Grad students, dorm residents, 
and girls began to join the con­
flict. The water-fighters doused 
passing cars, motorcycles, and 
pedestrians. Some ran to the 
bus-stop on Forbes and baptized 
a bus.
About 2 pm the Pittsburgh 
Police, responding to calls 
from innocent bystanders who 
had become involved, arrived 
on the scene and made two 
“token” arrests. They made 
three more when a large 
crowd gathered around the 
patrol car, shouting “Police 
brutality!” and throwing buc­
kets of water at the police­
men.
A paddy-wagon had to be call­
ed to accommodate the prison­
ers. With the help of Earle 
Swank, Dean of Men, the police 
were able to dissolve the crowd 
by 2:30.
Said one policeman, “This is 
higher education?”
UMOC Contest Features 
Ugliest Mugs Ever
This year’s “Ugliest Man on 
Campus” contest sponsored by 
ABhiO promises to be the most 
grotesque ever. The tradition 
of ballot stuffing — one penny 
per vote—will be continued, with 
proceeds going to Campus Chest.
Any interested group is en­
couraged to enter its favorite 
ugly man. Size of sponsoring 
group need not be a determining 
factor of success in ugliness, as 
the UMOC candidate at Pitt 
this year was sponsored by six 
girls.

their candidates to Don Baer

ber of experts has been sought, 
the experts themselves have a 
variety of opinions. Generally, 
Carnegie has accepted these sug­
gestions:
“a) The use of drugs any sort 
without the supervision of a 
physician may be dangerous;
*‘b) Students should be aware 
of not only the physical and 
psychological dangers of using 
a drug but also of the legal 
hazards;
“c) Students should have ac­
cess to personal advice and to 
reliable materials and opinions 
regarding drug uses.
“Carnegie cannot condone 
the use of a drug prohibited 
by the law. Although the atti­
tude of tiie university toward 
the use of drugs has been cor­
rective rather than punitive. 
It recognizes that some stu­
dents will experiment with 
drugs as with other things. 
However, students who do ex­
periment must realize that 
their experimentation may be 
a violation of the law, and if 
they are apprehended they 
must suffer the legal conse­
quences.

“On the one hand,” Steinberg 
asserted, "I recognize the argu­
ment that more - deprived kids 
get to serve in the army. There 
are also merits to the argument 
that the country needs educated 
people. How the country should 
reconcile this, I honestly don’t 
know.” In elaborating on the 
reasons for his confusion, Stein­
berg stated that there is noth­
ing wrong with idea of service 
to the country. In addition, he 
believes that women should be 
required to serve in some equiv­
alent organization. A system 
where everyone gives two or 
three years in the army or some 
meaningful alternative, such as 
the Peace Corps, VISTA, etc. 
would be very acceptable. It 
would have the added advan­
tage of slowing down the num­
ber of 18 and 19 year old mar­
riages and give youngsters a 
chance to mature. In return for 
this service, Steinberg would 
like to see the government re­
ciprocate with free education || 
(like the GI bill) for veterans 
of service.

Human IQ's To Increase 
Through Use of Chemicals
The improvement of man’s intelligence through the use 
of chemicals might be common practice within the next five 
or ten years, according to Dr. David Klech, Berkeley profes­
sor of psychology.
Speaking at last Thursday’s 
Bingham lecture, Dr. Klech said 
that there are already chemicals 
availabile which facilitate prob­
lem-solving and learning in ani­
mals.
Referring to speciific research, 
he explained that different 
strains of mice react differently 
to like doses of the same chemi­
cals and that different chemicals 
have the ability to improve the 
mastery of different tasks. 
“There seems to be an intellec­
tual limit even to the brain of 
a hopped-up California super 
mouse,” he noted, however. He 
went on to show how the bene- 
cial eqects of drugs are large 
enough to compensate for in­
tellectual inequalities between 
strains.
‘The brain cannot thrive on 
chemistry alone,” Dr. Krech ex­
plained. “Not only chemicals in­
fluence the brain, but also early 
behavior can influence brain 
chemistry.” Rats placed in an 
“enriched” environment during 
their early days, grew larger 
brains than did their twin broth­
ers raised in solitary confine­
ment.
What the California psycholo­
gist fears is the “frenzied and 
thoughtless application” of an 
“inexpensive get-smart pill” 
which could result in serious 
social problems. He offers three 
alternative future worlds—one 
in which everyone is proportion­
ately brighter; another in which 
the intelligence gap narrows as 
lesser individuals become more 
intelligent; and a third in which 
different abilities of different 
people are improved—and sug­
gests that we start planning for 
one of these immediately.

Editorial . . .
Idea Man or Leader
At the half-way point in the student government elec­
tions, one can divide the candidates into at least two distinct 
categories; those who feel that most important qualifications 
for president are his ideas, and those who feel that the 
president and student government can do something only 
through a closely knit, well organized body. Certainly Haan 
and Albertson belong in the first category, while Stafford 
and Peschel belong in the second.
As indicated in last week’s editorial, the latter 
stand is much more reasonable. While both Haian and 
Albertson refute the Tartan charge of pie-in-the-sky 
platforms, the fact remains that neither has made any 
constructive suggestions, or outlined any plans to make 
student government the effective, viable body it must 
become if their campaign promises are going to be ful­
filled. Even in a public debate on WRCT, neither Haan 
nor Albertson said anything new, especially as to how 
to organize student government for the ensuing year.
One cannot gain the support or respect of either stu­
dents or administrators simply by claiming to offer a pana­
cea for problems on campus, and at the same time neglect 
the vital issues that will determine whether student govern­
ment becomes an active body, or whether it remains inert 
and lifeless.
Haan seems to think that he can be a super-presi­
dent, able to leap large problems in a single bound. Yet 
he fails to realize that it is nearly impossible for one 
man to achieve these things by himself! Given then, 
that student government cannot be a one-man show, 
how does he intend to effect a response from student 
government. It is clear from the number of people that 
have bid for seats in the senate that there are still 
major organizational problems for the new leaders.
If one were to take Albertson’s platform at face value, 
the 11 points in it can be easily taken care of simply by 
appointing him as chairman of five or six committees. The 
ideas he outlines are not the duties of the president of the 
government, but most can be handled through committees. 
If the president and vice-president are not supposed to be 
only idea men, who contemplate the problems of existence 
as a student, then assign specific goals to committees. 
Rather, they are responsible for instituting the structures 
behind the committees, and the organization that supports 
student government as an effective group. The basic factor 
contributing to the downfall of government in the past has 
been lack of leadership, which Albertson seems to ignore.
Rather than render student government inactive for 
yet another year for want of leadership, the Tartan urges 
all students, before voting, to consider carefully the differ­
ences between leaders who have the ability to perceive the 
problems of student government, and have the ability to or­
ganize government in order to surmount these problems, 
and those who think that these problems will disappear if 
ignored. Idea men are easy to find, just listen to any bull 
session. Leaders, however, are not, just look at student gov­
ernment as it has existed in the past few years.

Haan Considered 
Unsuited For Prexy
Campus radio station WRCT 
has recently been the subject of 
considerable controversy, much 
of which has been pi’omulgated 
in the Tartan. Because the dis­
cussions have centered around 
the specific problems, reed or 
imagined, of the radio station, 
the participants in the debate 
have lost sight of its investiga­
tors. In view of the fact that one 
of these, namely Ron Haan, is 
currently running for the pres­
idency of the student body, it 
would be appropriate at this 
time to analyze his role in the 
WRCT issue.
Mr. Haan originally desired 
to subject the financial aspect 
of the management of the sta­
tion to a student government 
investigation. Because the stu­
dent government provides the 
station with a substantial pecun­
iary subsidy, such an investiga­
tion is justified, so long as the 
station’s budget serves as the 
sole criterion for evaluating the 
station’s use of its funds, and 
so long as the investigation is 
executed by the appropriate or­
gan of the student government, 
namely, the Finance Committee 
of the Student Senate.
To carry out the proposed in­
vestigation, however, Mr. Haan 
bypassed the finance committee, 
had the Student Senate estab­
lish an ad hoc committee, ap­
point him its chairman, and al­
low him „to appoint its mem­
bers. Furthermore, he broadened 
the scope of his intentions with 
the announcement that he would 
proceed to use the criterion of 
journalistic quality to judge the 
station’s use of funds.
In this latter respect, he re­
ceived “support” from Barry 
Cornet, former program director 
of the station, who in a report 
to Mr. Haan’s ad hoc committee, 
espoused the contention that the 
student government possesses 
the right to intervene in the op­
eration of a publication.
Such action, with which Mr. 
Haan by virtue of his an­
nouncement seemed to agree, 
would constitute a radical in­
fringement on the autonomy 
of a publication and on the 
authority of its head.
Mr. Haan then brought his 
proposed investigative program 
before the Executive Council of 
the student government, which 
promptly infoirried him that 
neither the student government, 
nor he as its representative, 
possesses the authority to car­
ry out that program.
The reasons for this quite 
appropriate reaction are clear. 
As the result of a lengthy con­
troversy which raged last year 
between the student govern­
ment and the Tartan, the gov- 
eminent acknowledged that, 
beyond the limited power to 
investigate the adherence of 
the management of a publica­
tion to its approved budget, 
the government has no author­
ity whatever over publica­
tions, that it has neither the 
competence nor the right to 
jud^e and/or control the qual­
ity of a publication’s product, 
the efficacy of its manage­
ment, and the nature of its 
policies. That the present con­
stitution of the student gov­
ernment contains no mention 
of publication bears witness 
to this acknowledgement.
Acting on the instructions of 
the Executive Council, Mr. Haan 
then approached the Carnegie 
Tech Chapter of Pi Delta Ep­
silon (PiDe) national journal­
ism honorary. It is this organ­
ization, the only one on campus, 
which possesses any measure of 
control over the internal opera­
tion of publications, to which 
Mr. Hann interested in questions 
of quality, should have address­
ed his earliest inquiries about 
the station.
By disregarding the constitu­
tional structure of the student 
government, by failing to rec­
ognize the limitations on its 
power and jurisdiction, and by 
ignoring the relevant source of 
authority (PiDE), Mr. Haan has 
established a dichotomy between 
the legitimate lines of authority 
and the lines along which he 
acted.
This manifest inability of 
Mr. Haan to deal effectively 
and legitimately with the is­
sue of WRCT demonstrates 
that he is not at present suit­
able material for the presiden­
cy of the student government.

Congress VP Favors 
Candidate Ron Haan
Editor, the Tartan:
As stated before, the execu­
tive positions of student gov­
ernment must be filled with the 
best qualified people. In his role 
as chief spokesman for the stu­
dent body, the President must 
be familiar not only with the 
political process of S. G., but 
must formulate positions that 
are indicative of student opin­
ion. Serving as Chairman of 
Parking, Library, General Cam­
pus and Food Service Commit­
tees, as well as being active in 
Men’s Dormitory Council and 
the Undergraduate Advisory 
Committee, familiarize one with 
a vast number of different prob­
lems on campus. In addition to 
other activities that enable him 
to know the students and their 
problems, as well as having held 
and effectively executed the 
above positions, it is my opinion 
that Ron Haan has the experi­
ence and competency needed to 
serve as President of the stu­
dent body.

Jack Trezise
Schulman Praised 
As Best Qualified
Editor, the Tartan:
Of primary importance to the 
effective functioning of student 
government is that there exist 
some form of continuity from 
year to year, lest total chaosi 
set in accompanied by duplica­
tion and repetition as the admin­
istration changes.
It has been one of the primary 
goals of this administration to 
seek out the best qualified peo­
ple to serve the campus so that 
the accumulated experience and 
knowledge of previous years 
will not be lost.
It is Unnecessary to emphasize 
the importance of developing 
and maintaining an effective 
rapport not only with members 
of the faculty and administra­
tion, but with all organizations 
that come under the authority 
of student government. I
Now, as it is time for a new 
government to be elected, it is 
important that the best qualified 
people be chosen. Although 
there are several competent in­
dividuals seeking the executive 
positions, there is one in parti­
cular who I feel can best exe­
cute the duties of the Vice-Pres­
ident. He is a student of good 
standing and has certainly done 
his share of work for the cam­
pus. In addition, he has been 
able to gain an intimate know­
ledge of the processes, channels 
and operations that are involved , 
in the normal functioning of 
student government. After hav­
ing served as Union Commit­
tee cochairman which has been 
the focus of much long hard 
work and, quite often, frustra­
tion from many sources, it is un­
likely that anyone can be blind 
to the problems associated with ^ 
not only this project, but others1 
that touch on it. This also pro­
vides an excellent opportunity 
to observe and understand the 
heart of student government — 
the committee system.
Since the Vice President sits 
as President of the Senate and 
is in direct control of these 
committees', a knowledge of 
them and the Senate is impor­
tant. After serving as a senator, 
it is my opinion that Robert 
Schulman is best qualified for 
the office and I fully endorse 
and support his candidacy.

change proposals, and eventual­
ly the issue died. We figure that 
we can put off making a deci­
sion on a graduation date and 
eventually it too will die.”
The final answer came from 
J. G. Johnsonbyrd, vice-presi­
dent for Development of Pover- 
(Continued on Page 7)
Graduation Canceled; 
Various Reasons Given
In-an unprecedented move last week, President H. Nice- 
Guy Even-Steven announced that the graduation ceremon­
ies, originally scheduled for June 5 have been canceled.
The Tartan, in talking to vari­
ous administrators discovered 
that apparently no one in War­
ner Hall knew there was even 
going to be a graduation, ex­
cept a few administrators. The 
first stop was the Division of 
Student Affairs, where the Earle 
of Swank said he did not know 
anything about it, and besides 
it wasn’t any of his doing, and 
wasn’t his fault, and that the 
responsibility was not his and 
don’t blame him. Assistant Dean 
West-Virginia Mulligan-Stew al­
luded to the fact that the hours 
for Morewood girls and Colonial 
Manor residents would not have 
permitted them to attend the
> ceremonies anyway, since it was 
too late in the morning. In fact, 
she stated that most girls would 
be allowed out of the dorms 
only on July 4, providing each 
had a letter in triplicate from 
her parents and minister or rab­
bi asserting that they would not 
look at any men during this 
day.
Head of the Division of Stu­
dent Affairs Gee-Whiz Braun 
added that such a ceremony 
would only detract from the 
image of Carnegie Tech, since 
graduations traditionally draw 
undesirable people from the 
outside such as parents and 
newspapermen. Since the 
school’s image would be irre­
parably damaged by their pre­
sence, graduation was can­
celed.
In seeking more answers, the 
Tar tan interviewed the vice-pres­
idents. Vice-president for Busi­
ness Manipulations C. O. D.
Strathmeyerberg stated that 
Tech could not possibly afford 
a graduation ceremony this year.
In fact, the new policy just for­
mulated, requires graduation to 
be run on a no-loss, no-gain 
basis. For this reason, to offset 
the cost of persuading the green 
men to set up chairs and decora­
tions, a peanut concession was 
considered, with vendors circu­
lating in the crowd during ac­
tual ceremony. However, since 
this policy was put in effect so 
late in the year, negotiations 
i with the peanut-vendors union 
were fruitless, since they were 
previously booked up that day 
for Forbes Field.
Vice-president for Polemics 
and Academic Trivia Edward- 
calls - the - Schatz noted that 
only a few people, mostly 
night school students, would 
have been able to schedule 
graduation (Referred to as
B.S. 69) anyway, and besides, 
the course will be dropped 
next year because it is too 
easy.
Vice-president for Planting Raw 
Kibbe claimed that graduation 
was “old hat,” and that an up- 
to-date institution could not pos­
sibly have it on their schedule.
Although an Ad Hoc Gradua­
tion Committee was formed to 
try to reconcile some of the dif­
ferences, no final policy was for­
mulated by this group. Besides, 
as Kibee pointed out, “We pro­
crastinated on the calendar
School Makes Birth Policy 
Corrective,Not Punitive
The Carnegie Tech Division of Student Affairs is expected to announce its official 
policy on the use of birth control devices early next week. This announcement will come 
practically on the heels of its policy stateme nt last week on the use of drugs on campus. 
In several recent letters to the --------------------------------------------------
editor, angry students have 
charged that the school is se­
cretly collaborating with the 
Catholic Church in its investiga­
tion of birth control, and that 
dossiers on students known to 
practice birth control are on file 
in the office of Father Walsh of
the Oratory. They also claim 
there are hidden cameras in 
Morewood and Colonial Manor 
and Church “spies” in the fra­
ternity houses.
The final policy statement 
should clear up the school’s 
stand on these matters. UntilC.U. to Lead Pittsburgh In Modern Technology
Axle-breaking ceremonies were held recently at the 
unveiling of four new pothholes in the Skibo Parking lot. 
From the following interview with the head of Physical 
Plant, who called in the head of the civil engineering depart­
ment, much was learned about the nature of pot on ... or 
potholes on campus.
Tartan: Well, sir, we couldn’t help but notice the pot­
holes in the parking lot this morning and . . .
Plant: Thank you. It’s nice to see a college student being 
complimentary these days. ____________________________
T: What we were wondering 
is why now? Why should the 
potholes be there? What is be­
ing done about them? But most­
ly, why potholes at all?
P: Two reasons: Prestige and 
research.
T: Come again?
P? Next year we’ll be Car­
negie University, and we cannot 
hold our heads up in Pittsburgh 
unless we accept our fair share 
of potholes.
T: Our what?
P: Fair share. You don’t think 
we get these many potholes in 
Pittsburgh distributed by chance 
do you? We have to bid for 
them. Pitt almost won the pot­
holes, but decided to repair the 
inverted pothole on Forbes Ave­
nue instead.
T: Well, then, how does re­
search enter the picture?
P: I’ll let my learned col­
league from Civil Engineering 
explain that. Go ahead Cousin 
George.
Civil Engineer: It’s this way. 
When we merge with Mellon In­
stitute we’ll have to carry on 
expended and diversified re­
search.
T: Where do potholes come in?
C.E.: Potholes take a lot of 
time and money to construct. 
The potholes» you see in the 
parking lot are a new prefabri­
cated variety.
T: Pre fab?
C.E.: Yes, structural weak­
nesses are built right into the 
asphalt so that potholes achieve 
just the size and shape desired 
when desired. These are part 
of the second shipment we’ve 
received.
T: The second shipment? You 
mean we’ll get more?
C.E.: Not exactly. As one
group of potholes is removed 
and evaluated, another is put 
in its place. You will never no­
tice the difference.
T: How do you evaluate a pot­
hole:
C.E.: In this case, we have 
several parameters!. There are 
speed of construction ability to 
reach desired width and depth, 
ease of the removal — so that 
same pothole can be used in se­
veral places during the same 
day—and damage done to pass­
ing vehicles.
T: How is that evaluated and 
why?
C.E.: When the FBI was on 
campus we managed to “obtain” 
some cameras, which are install­
ed in the parking meters and 
focused on the potholes. We also 
send observers, dressed as se­
curity men, into the lot to check 
the condition of selected autos. 
In addition we sweep the lot 
near the potholes every night. 
Could you use a ’57 Chevy shock 
absorber? Hardly used at all.
T: No, thanks.
C.E.: How about a ’62 Merc 
Wheel Cover?

‘Feds’ Get Scoops 
For Tartan News
Getting the dope on latest 
campus and off-campus happen­
ings, Tartan reporters were 
spied tripping around in a most 
suspicious fashion last month. 
In the guise of federal agents, 
the obsecure frosh — some of 
them fresh out of Hanoi— 
brought their cameras to TGIF 
and their pencils and Dean 
Swank to the snack bar.
Introducing themselves to 
Tech soda jerks, they told 
stories about the narcotics ar­
rests they had facilitated on oth­
ers other campuses. They sat 
at night at round tables read­
ing their literature books and 
taping the highest humor 
around. Conspicuously dressed 
in collegiate sports jackets and 
loafers but none the less inter­
ested, they tried to get them­
selves invited wherever they 
could.
The security men at More­
wood, they assumed, might be 
able to identify “swingers” from 
some old Tartan contact prints. 
Unknowing students assumed 
differently, hiding behind door­
ways in an attempt to listen. As 
Tartan reporters befriended 
Morewood women, the gallery 
moved closer.
Within a week, more than 20 
letters (some of them printed in 
the last three Tartans) came to 
the Skibo office complaining of 
federal threats to student secur­
ity. Because of the Bravo-smok­
ing reporters, the Administration 
was criticized as a collaborator. 
They prepared a statement on 
the serious side this week.
Heavy Cuts In Draft Call; 
U.S. Forces To Withdraw
WASHINGTON, APRIL 1, 1970 (Exclusive to the Tar­
tan) ... Tech students can breathe a little easier about their 
draft status. Selective Service Head Gen. Lewis B. Hershey- 
bar announced today that draft calls for this month and 
coming months will be reduced by almost 95 per cent. Gen- 
Hershey-bar linked the draft cut to President Johnson’s 
announcement yesterday that the United States will begin 
a speedy withdrawal of its armed forces from Vietnam.
Johnson’s announcement 
reads, in part, “. . .We can no 
longer go on fighting this 
senseless war. Our boy:i are 
being decimated at an appal­
ling rate, and it seems improb­
able that we can effectively
contain the Viet Cong and 
North Vietnamese forces to 
North Vietnam. They say it 
takes a big man to admit he’s
then, the Division of Student 
Affairs has issued a preliminary 
statement which says:
“Carnegie has been concerned 
with the problem of birth con­
trol among college students for 
a number of years. Three years 
ago a special committee to study 
the problem was appointed by 
then-President Warner.
“Advice of a number of ex­
perts was sought. . . . Generally, 
Carnegie has accepted these sug­
gestions:
a) The use of birth control 
devices of any sort without the 
supervision of a physician may 
be dangerous;
“b) Students should be aware 
of not only the physical and 
psychological dangers of using 
birth control but also of the spir­
itual hazards;
“c) Students should have ac­
cess to personal advice and to 
reliable materials and opinions 
regarding birth control.
"Carnegie cannot condone 
the use of devices prohibited 
by natural law. ... It rec­
ognizes that some students 
will experiment with birth 
control as with other things. 
However, students who do ex­
periment must realize that ex­
perimentation may be a viola­
tion of natural law and if ap­
prehended they must suffer 
the consequences. ... If a 
student is known to continue 
practices which inherently in­
clude use of birth control de­
vices, he will be considered in 
need of medical or psychiatric 
help . . .
“The Student Affairs Division 
is prepared to supplement point 
(c) above by arranging a semi­
nar on birth control for inter­
ested students. Tentatively, Vir­
ginia B. Milligan, Assistant Dean 
of Students, will conduct the 
seminar."
been beaten — well, we’re ad­
mitting it. We’ve lost, and 
we’re pulling out . . .”
For the past several months, 
American fortunes have taken 
a turn for the worse in Vietnam.
Several former Defense De­
partment officials blamed the 
changing tide of the war on Gen­
eral Hershey-bar.
Exactly three years ago to­
day, April 1, 1967, Gen. Hershey- 
bar announced the abolishment 
of all student deferments and 
“critical skills” deferments for 
engineers, scientists, and teach­
ers, and the institution of Gen-

I Do Believe I Can Tell 
The Critics Apart
by Stan Thomas
A public service guide for anyone interested in recognizing— 
even without reading the reviews—the three Tartan critics:
by Sight
If the critic looks like a Boston gangster who was once told 
that he looks like Tom Woolf, it’s Tim Bay
If the critic looks like he’s left over from the third company 
of “The Endless Summer,” it’s Tony Lawrence.
If the critic looks like he’s been in the dark for three days it’s 
Stan Thomas who has either returned from a five day Film Fes­
tival, a three day drunk, or seeing “Blow-Up” for the tenth time.
If the critic is rushing somewhere and is just as confused 
about where he’s going as you are, it’s Tony Lawrence.
If the critic is sitting in Skibo on Sunday morning staring at 
a cup of Sprite and typewriter with a clean sheet of paper insert­
ed, it’s Stan Thomas.
If someone is staring over his shoulder, it’s Tim Bay. 
by Opening Paragraph
If the opening paragraph of the review mentions the director, 
his past three, films, and cross references with three other unre­
lated films, you have three choices:
Tim Bay, but only if the rest of the article is totally unrelated.
Stan Thomas, but only if the rest of the article is unrelated.
Tony Lawrence, but only if he calls everyone by his first name, 
by Length of Article
If the article is one paragraph or eight pages it was written 
by Stan Thomas.
If the article is eight pages and reads like one paragraph it 
was written by Tony Lawrence.
If the article is one paragraph and reads like eight pages it 
was written by Tim Bay.
If the article is brilliant, you’re not reading the Tartan, 
by Opinions Expressed Within
If you’ve finished reading this article and instantly write a 
letter to the editor, it was written by Tony Lawrence.
If you’ve just finished reading the article and discover the 
film is either eight years old or hasn’t been shown in Pittsburgh

“face it, what is more impor­
tant, graduation or a new build­
ing, which will serve as a per­
manent shrine to the money of 
Pittsburgh. After all, why would 
anyone give money for a Dra­
matic Arts Center, let alone 
graduation, since neither one 
has any prestige to it. You can’t 
drive around in your limousine, 
pointing out all the sights to a 
friend and say, ‘there is the 
Dramatic Arts Center I built,’ 
or ‘there is the graduation I fi­
nanced,’ when it means much 
more to say,’ there is the new, 
crowded, six story building I 
built for the Carnegie Tech 
Green Men.’ ”
In one last desperate attempt, 
the Tartan stumbled into the 
Security Office and asked the 
desk sergeant if he knew why 
graduation was cancelled, but he 
couldn’t tell us without permis­
sion from the chief. Chief Egg- 
foo-Yung was out on patrol at 
the moment and could not be 
reached since the range of the 
walkie-talkie he carried did not 
extend to Mellon Institute. When 
asked why the chief was car­
rying a walkie-talkie and could 
not use the car radio instead, 
the sergeant replied that dur­
ing the last patrol of the fra­
ternity area, several buckets of 
water were dumped on it and 
the car stalled and would not 
start. Finally, the Tartan asked 
the security officer his name, 
just to keep the record straight, 
tut he said he could not divulge 
his name without the permission 
of the chief.

Gen. Hershey-bar made the move 
in response to pressure from the

The Defense Department men 
who criticized this change have 
since been dismissed.
General William Westmore­
land, commander of American 
forces in Vietnam, officially 
blamed the failure of the war 
effort on an “extensive espion­
age and sabotage campaign” 
by the communists. He said the 
communist espionage agents, 
through clever pilfering of 
American military secrets, are 
responsible for the sudden, 
shocking technical superiority 
of the enemy’s weaponry. He 
also pointed to the sabotage 
program as the cause of the 
recent series of unexplained 
mechanical failures — blow­
outs of sophisticated electric­
al equipment, misfiring of mis­
siles, and failures of supply 
vehicles to meet schedules — 
which have jeapordized the 
soldiers in the field.
THE RAISON D’ETRE AWARD — To the sororities
Through The Looking Qlass ? ? ?
Greatest Story... 
by Cl Day Never Told
With characteristic modesty and intelligence, Hollywood’s new­
est excursion into the field of religion, “The Holy Ghost Meets Mary 
Magdalene” is one of the most moving, pictorally magnificent and 
educational films of our times. As sequel to Max Von Sternum’s 
religious classic “God was my Flight Engineer” this film in its sen­
sitivity towards and understanding of the subtleties of Religion, 
has set the cause of “organized religion” back 500 years. Further­
more, as a much publicized “humanitarian” gesture, Mammouth 
Movies in this film has chosen its extras from specially selected 
minority groups e.g. the lower nubian tribe of the Upper Esoteric 
Valley, the CIA, and Robert MacNamara and the War Department.
The plot concerns the attempts of ANTI CHRIST (a secret sub­
versive atheist organization) to steal the Ten Commandments from 
Moses, who has hidden them in the upper left corner of his right 
index finger.
Added attractions in the film are: John Huston renacting his 
famed role as the voice of God; the Morman Tabernacle Choir sing­
ing the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel’s “Messiah;” and Daryl F. 
Zanuck conducting the Israeli Armed Forces in a series of man- 
uevers in the Gobi Desert. Sammy Davis Jr. who was seen last year 
in the title role of the musical based on the life of George Wash­
ington Carver, “The Peanut Man,” sings the title song of the movie. 
He is assisted by 200 members of the All American, All Girl, Girl 
Scout Chorus who hum the refrain of the song, entitled “Marching 
to Jerusalem.”
As Mary Magdalane, who wrestles the Ten Commandments 
from the hands of ANTI CHRIST agents, Julie Andrews sings and 
dances her way through, in one of the most exciting and spiritual 
roles of her career. Bushy Berkeley, came out of semi-retirement 
to stage with the Radio City Rockettes the choreography; his stag­
ing of the last supper with its ingenious tap dance routine by John 
the Baptist (Peter Ustinov) and his staging of the Red Sea episode 
were particularly effective.
The finale of the film, the recovering of the tablet and the Ser­
mon on the Mount by Billy Graham as Charleton Heston, is played 
against a stunning Jo Mellziner scrim, left over from his “Death 
of a Salesman” set, while a row of chorus girls come out dressed in 
flourescent costumes and singing “Ding-Dong the God is Not Dead.”
Incidentally, this film is currently making the rounds of the 
neighborhood churches, and by order of Cardinal Spellman and 
the Catholic Church is being inserted in a time capsule buried in the 
middle of Times Square for the benefit of future generations. All 
that I can say is that I sat there the whole time and cried.
THE JEFF AXELRAD MEMORIAL AWARD FOR 
JOURNALISTIC EXCELLENCE — to the Pittsburgh Post- 
Gazette, for its editorial of March 27, 1967, “Tuning Up;” 
reprinted in full below:
“There is music in the air on windy, blue-sky days. A 
perfectionist might claim that he hears notes slightly off 
key; but only a perfectionist could object as the woodwinds, 
flutes, cellos and percussion instruments sound the intro­
ductory notes that will swell to fortissimo a little later.
“Bluejays flash above the orchard and their far-carry­
ing bugling tells a world stirring from ice and cold that a 
new season is here. Crows sit in tall elms by the meadow 
brook and sound raucous notes that are strangely musical.
“Chickadees chant their sweet, two-note spring song 
from the wild black cherry. Cock partridges mount a fallen 
log far on a mellow March day.
“You can hear the soft sounds of violins and cellos 
among evergreen branches. On a mild day after a frosty 
night, the drip-drip of water from icicles keeps gentle time. 
The winter sleep is over; but primal forces are stirring. If 
a man listens, he can hear the prelude. It is only tuning-up 
time, but the tentative notes are a welcome melody as win­
ter retreats.”

In commenting on the letters- 
to-the-editor printed in the Tar­
tan, on March 15, Dean Brown 
stated that Tech has not done 
any investigating in affairs of 
this sort, and that there has 
been no “spying” on individuals 
as such. Furthermore, Tech has 
not been informed of any agents 
on campus, although “it is pos­
sible that agents have been on 
campus, in Skibo perhaps, with­
out Carnegie’s knowledge.” Gen­
erally when agents of the Pitts­
burg police or other enforce­
ment officers plan to be on cam­
pus.
One of the truly great, great, great, great, great films of all 
time is starring my favorite—Humphrey Bogart, Bataan was Bo­
gart’s very first film and in it he plays a Marine Corps sergeant to 
perfection. Bataan, very simply, deals with approximately 25,000 
soldiers stranded at a desert oasis and the inability of them to 
comprehend what it is all about. It is cinematically perfect and 
the epitome of light-modification within the idiom.
Also in the film is Bogart’s second wife, Carole Lombard, who 
was very well known for her high ability as a depthful, highly 
charged, and intense dramatic actress. This time though she plays 
in the light comedy range and carries it off with obliverance and 
postuity.
Bogart has always been a fascinating film subject. He was 
born on October 20, 1921, to Esther and Hyman Bogart in New 
York City. He originally wanted to go into advertising and studied 
the above-mentioned trade at Harvard, rooming with Clark Gable 
for a year and a half. After his strong desire for the acting pro­
fession was known he made rapid strides. His first major acting 
assignment was understudying Howard Lindsay in Life with Fa­
ther in 1932. Other roles soon followed such as Mia in Dough An­
derson’s Winterset, Marchbanks in Candide, and George in Our 
Town. Soon after, Dore Schary discovered him and brought the 
young Humphrey out to Hollywood where he played opposite such 
starlets as Marie Dressier, Norman Shearer, Maria Ouspenskaya, 
Tab Hunter, and Texas Guinan. Among his better known films 
are The Great Westerner, My Man Godfrey, Veronia Lake, The 
Big Sky, and Pigskin Parade. He won an Academy Award in 1943 
for his astounding performance. His last film: Carta Blanca, co- 
starring Sonny Tufts recently was awarded. Because of Bogart’s 
rather odd first name, Hollywood folk affectionately called him 
—Molloy. Underground movies stink, but John Brown is a heck 
of a nice kid. Nubby, this is right.

A $90,000 thermionic source mass spectrometer, pur­
chased through a $40,000 grant from the National Science

a graduate-oriented program be­
gun in 1964 to broaden the 
school’s scientific exploration of 
the physical universe, hope to 
gain information about the 
moon’s origin and the history 
of the solar system.
But the impending moon study 
is only one of many investiga­
tions involving the new mass 
spectrometer, a 6000-pound de­
vice used to determine the iso­
topic composition of elements.
Other mass spectrometer re­
search either underway or plan­
ned includes:
? Metoritic lead studies for 
data pertinent to the chronology 
of the early solar system.
? Terrestrial lead studies, 
seeking clues on the nature of 
the earth's interior and on the 
origin and nature of lead ores.
? The search for extinct nat­
ural radionuclides, to provide 
information on the earliest his­
tory of the solar system.
? The study of rubidium-stron­
tium relationships, to indicate 
whether rubidium-strontium ra­
tios in rocks give clues to the 
formation of the earth’s crust.
Supervising these projects is 
an interdepartmental faculty 
committee chaired by Dr. Koh­
man, professor of chemistry. Dr. 
Ostic, assistant professor of geo­
physics, is actively working on 
the studies and graduate stu­
dents in geophysics and geo­

part of their thesis work.

The study of isotopic elements

Tech Track Squad Scores 
Easy Win Over Jeannette
by Ron Finnin
The CIT track team started its 1967 season Saturday with a victory over the Jeannette Har­
riers. The Tartans looked strong to the fans that were on hand at the Tech field as they took 11 
firsts in 16 events. The Tartans also showed great potential for coming years as the brunt of the 
coring was done by sophomores, backed by a few freshmen and relatively few juniors and seniors.
As for the rest of this sea­
son, Coach Ed Vames says it 
is going to be a tough year for 
Tech. The teams biggest trouble 
is that it is spread too thin and 
lacks the depth needed against 
strong opponents. Against a 
team that won’t give up the 
high percentage of first places 
that Jeannette did, Tech will be 
hurting for the seconds and 
thirds that are necessary to win 
close meets. However, with lots 
of effort and drive, and support 
from the students, the Tartans 
could well pull off a winning 
season.
The big standards of the day 
were Bemie Flynn and Ernie 
Jones. Flynn, a second year man 
on the Tech team, paced the 
distance runners as he swept the 
half-mile, mile, and two-mile 
runs. The most exciting of these 
was the half-mile where Flynn, 
running third some 20 yards off 
the leader, made his move going 
into the backstretch of the sec­
ond lap to come up strong and 
win with a time of 2:02.3. Ernie 
Jones, of the Jeannette Harriers, 
set a new Tech Bowl record in 
the Javelin with a throw of 
197’3”; he also won the discus 
and the high jump.
Next Saturday, Tech travels 
to Indiana State University in 
Indiana, Pa. to try for its sec­
ond win of the season. The next 
home meet is Saturday, April 
22 as Tech plays host to St. 
Francis and Waynesburg.

In the semi-finals played be­
fore Easter, ATO clipped TDP 
4-1 while BTP walloped SN 
“White” by a 6-1 score.
The finals between ATO and 
Beta proved to be a real thriller. 
Both teams scored a goal apiece 
during regulation time. Then, in 
the sixth overtime period, the 
Betas scored once again to win 
the game 2-1 and hence the
championship.

?Weak two-bid.
The top board for East and 
West went to the pair who,
through the above bidding, were 
able to steal the contract for 
four hearts. Without the weak 
two bid, they never would have 
gotten there. West has no good 
bid over South’s space opener, 
and many North • South pairs 
got to diamond partials. At four 
hearts, East had to lose only a 
diamond and a club when the 
LOL who set South decided to 
drop her king of trumps under 
the act. This hearty move made 
little difference, however, as this 
East-West pair was the only one 
to get a plus score on the hand.
The top score for North-South 
went to a pair which, through 
wild bidding, found themselves 
at five diamonds doubled. East 
unwisely chose the ace of hearts 
for the opening lead, and de­
clarer lost only a club as he 
pitched his losing spade on the 
king of hearts. Thus the key 
word of the week is “avoid." 
The first West had to avoid dou­
bling South’s spade so as to keep 
North and South from running 
to diamonds, and the second 
South employed a void in mak­
ing a doubled overtrick.
