THE FIELD.
The Field has at last begun to take on consid­
erable resemblance to an Athletic field, and under 
the direction of Mr. Clinton the top soil is being 
rapidly put on and leveled off. Although the grass 
will not be in evidence at the first game, in one 
week from Saturday the grounds will at least have 
taken on the semblance of what we hope to see 
later on. The field committee has gotten to work 
with a will and have already let the contract for 
erection of the fence and stands. The contract 
price is in the neighborhood of $1,500, the exact 
figures can be gotten from the financial committee 
or any member of the field committee if any one is 
curious enough to inquire.
Home plate, as the plans now are, has been 
shifted from the position originally intended and is 
now in the corner nearest the curve in Woodlawn 
avenue, and the third base line will be almost par­
allel with Woodlawn avenue. This gives a field as 
large as most of the minor league teams have and 
considerably larger than a great many. The right 
field will be a sun field to some extent, although 
not entirely so, and the other fields and the catcher 
will not be bothered at all.
The first game will be with Western Reserve on
the 24th, and it has been suggested that there 
should be some sort of a celebration on that oc­
casion. It would seem eminently fitting that we 
do something to celebrate our emancipation from • 
condition of perpetual uncertainty and turmoil. 
Also it would be eminently the proper thing that 
Western Reserve be given some sort of a reception 
as our base-ball team has never scheduled a game 
with them before, and our foot-ball team was com­
pelled to cancel a game scheduled with them for last 
fall on account of a conflict in the schedule. If any 
one has any definite ideas on this matter let them 
speak to either some member of the governing board 
or a member of the field committee before the week 
is out.
Another thing that would be in order would be 
some sort of congratulatory word to Mr. Leeds for 
the energy which he has displayed in working out 
his well nigh hopeless task. The ground keeper 
says that it may be necessary to allow the grounds 
a couple more weeks of idleness in order to get the 
grass well started after the Reserve game, although 
he gives positive assurance that this one game will 
do no permanent damage even if the sod is hardly 
started.

ATHLETICS.
Base-Ball.
The base-ball team left Monday at 3.30 P. M., on 
their eastern trip. Owing to the three days of cold 
weather during the last week the team has been 
having indoor talks by the coach. The team /vill 
meet some fast teams on this trip, and if they win 
a majority of the games they Will have something 
to be proud of. The following men will take the 
trip and bat in this order: ,
Barclay ..........................L. F.
Halferty ........................R. F.
McKinley ......................1st b.
Coldren ..........................3d b.
Fuhs ...............................M. F.
Hittner ...........................2d b.
Kirk ................................S. S.
Leety ..............................................................C.
Kemp ..............................................................P.
Stockweil ......................................................P.
Reynolds ........................................................P.
The following is the schedule to be played on this 
trip:
Albright—April 13, at Myerstown, Pa.
Lehigh—April 14, at South Bethlehem, Pa.
Harrisburg—April 15, at Harrisburg, Pa.
Merceraburg—April 16, at Mercersburg, Pa.
State College—April 17, at State.
Halferty is going along and play through Thurs­
day, when he has to return to take part in the relay 
race on Saturday. Crumley will join the team at 
Harrisburg on Thursday evening and play in Hal- 
ferty’s place, Friday and Saturday.
The new grounds behind the M. M. C. S. Schools 
are rapidly being put in condition and will be ready 
with the seating capacity of the old foot-ball field, 
for the opening game. Much credit is due Mr. Leeds 
for the fine field we are going to have. He has 
practically engineered the whole scheme and has 
spent much time and worry over what seemed an 
impossible problem.
T rack.
The track candidates have been working out for 
some time and have developed some speedy men. 
The fastest have been gradually picked out by 
means of trials and the aspirants for the relay team, 
which is to run in the large P. A. A. meet on Sat­
urday have been cut down to six, namely, Capt. 
Dowling, Charles, Halferty, Hosey, Gilkinson, Hatch­
er. All these men are last year’s track men and 
are even faster than they were last year. The four 
who win a place on this relay team are sure to 
make a fine showing against the relay teams of the 
other colleges entered. The most dangerous rivals
are W. & J. and the fast Redskins from Carlisle. 
However, Tech is the favorite, and if the fellows 
round in condition there is no doubt that they will 
take the relay race. The team will practice all 
this week and if the weather is good they should be 
in tne pink of condition by Saturday.
WHAT THEY DO AND SAY ELSEWHERE.
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs of the University 
of California are to take a trip to Chicago at the ex­
pense of the iSanta Fe Railroad. The clubs will 
perform for the benefit of the various railroad Y. M.
C. A. branches and improvement clubs along the 
way, and in turn will receive free transportation 
from San Francisco to Chicago and return, also 
meals and the use of a special Pullman car. The 
trip will take about three weeks, and cover about 
5,000 miles.
A favorite toast—Here’s to our teachers and our 
parents; may they never meet.
The second annual Circus and Hippodrome of the 
University of Pennsylvania was given last Saturday 
evening under the auspices of the Gym Club of 
Pennsylvania. Over 200 students took part in the 
performance, which “sported” a program of twenty 
different acts.
At the University of Oregon the faculty does not 
believe in politics, and has threatened to expel any 
student voting in the coming municipal election.
Penn students are now working on their annual 
show, “Merely a Monarch,” the first performance of 
which will be held in Atlantic Citty on April 10. 
Five trips in all will be taken, the men playing in 
Atlantic City on April 10, afternoon and evening; 
April 12 and 17 at the Chestnut Street Opera House, 
Philadelphia; April 26, Broad Street Theatre, Uni­
versity Night; May 1st, Pittsburg, afternoon and 
evening; May 3d, evening performance at Buffalo— 
ten performances in all.
The “Blackfriar Club” of the University of Chi­
cago, held the cast try-outs for their musical comedy, 
“The Lyrical Liar,” last week.
More than 500 copies of the poster used in adver­
tising Boston Tech's show, “The Pill Grimm,” have 
been sold.
Mr. Gilbert McClurg, who delivered his lecture on 
“Texas” here two weeks ago, will repeat it before 
the students of Lehigh University this week.

A Cosmopolitan Club, in which five nationalities 
are represented, has recently been formed at the 
University of Pennsylvania.

The base-ball team of Brown University will take 
the longest trip ever taken by a university team 
when it travels from Providence, R. I., to Seattle, 
Wash., to participate in an inter-collegiate tourna­
ment at the Pacific-Yukon Exposition.
The question of the -hour at Columbia University 
seems to be, “Have you seen Sam?”
Dean Van Amringe, of Columbia, was given a 
birthday dinner by five hundred alumni and a glee 
club twenty-five years graduated. The good Dean 
has been connected with the University for fifty 
years.
The trustees of Case have decided to endow a 
chair for a new professorship, called the visiting 
professor, whose duty it will be to visit high schools 
and colleges of Ohio and neighboring States, study 
their methods and acquaint them with the advan­
tages of Case.
The staffs of the Daily Princetonian and the Yale 
News will play ball at Princeton on May 7.
California will give gold medals to the winners of 
firsts in the interclass meet.
A student branch of the American Society of Me­

On Tuesday and Thursday evenings of last week 
the Thespian Dramatic Club presented “Alice in 
Wonderland.” The Faculty and students were the 
guests of the Club. Owing to bad weather the Tues­
day night audience was not large, but made up in 
appreciation what it lacked in size. The gym was 
well filled Thursday evening with an enthusiastic 
audience. The production was a marked success, 
each part being well taken, and the costumes most 
wonderful. In the choruses, the Club was assisted 
by the Glee Club. An orchestra and a ball drill 
by four of the Plebes filled up the intermissions 
pleasantly. The success of the entertainment was 
largely due to the patient and untiring efforts of 
Miss Fisher. The cast of characters was as follows:
Alice .............................Josephine Mandeville
King of Hearts .........................Ada Ramlack
Queen of Heax*ts ..............Rebecca Shuman
White King .............................Martha Bovard
White Queen ................Florence Ramlack

wish her a speedy return to health.
Miss Madeline Meese, of the Junior Dressmaking 
Class, is laid up with a broken shoulder. The sym­
pathy and best wishes of all are with her.
The editor from this school was the guest of sev­
eral oi the Senior Secretarial girls at a most delight­
ful little supper Thursday evening. From a dietetic 
Standpoint the menu was fearfully and wonderfully 
made, but none the less enjoyable for a’ that an’ a’ 
that. The service was faultless, even if they did 
have to wash dishes between courses, and the decor­
ations were most elaborate and artistic. The guest 
was accorded the honor of making and pouring the 
tea, which, for various reasons, nobody drank! That" 
is, nobody but Miss Scott. Ices and bonbons closed 
the repast. No fatalities have been reported—yet.
P. S.—I forgot to remark that the supper was 
served in the large and commodious laundry.
P. S. again—It was fun, anyway!

Encouraged by the reception of his last effusion, 
the correspondent from Braddock wishes to relate 
a few things about Willie Frank’s Uncle Theobald:
Five sons had Mr. Wilberforce,
And, being keen on knowledge,
He took it as a thing of course,
To send them all to college.
(Poor man, who’d no one to proclaim 
His quite misinformation!
He thought mere wisdom was the aim 
Of higher education).
John Jasper was the oldest son—
He made the school eleven—
Now (thanks to duty nobly done),
John Jasper is in heaven.
The Sophomores caught William Fritz,
Old Wilberforce’s next ’un;
They kicked him playfully to bits,
And passed him to the sexton.
George James was bound upon the track 
(Sing college frats so merry!)
And what they found of him, alack!
Was scarce enough to bury.
bam Jack excelled at fisticuff
(One higher branch they taught ’em) —
What though the s<port were somewhat rough?
Jack passed a fine post-mortem.
The fifth son, Tom, still lives-—of course,
He did not go to college—
(By this time Mr. WTilberforce 
Had got enough of knowledge).
And Tom, unlearned, stints hard and saves 
The money that he’s earning,
To place this tablet o’er four graves: —
“They Died of Too Much Learning.”—Ex.
Extract from that renowned .storiette about Har­
old and Mable: —
“No explanation is necessary, Harold, for ‘seeing 
is believing,’ and she left him gazing with unseeing 
eyes at the pin in his hand.”
Probably that was the reason he didn’t believe it.
Harvard and the University of Wisconsin will 
enter the annual relay games given by Pennsyl­
vania on Franklin Field for the first time this year.

President—Hittner.

Secretary—Bigelow.
Treasurer—Henderson.
Dear Jingling: —
Now that you are safely out of office (and almost 
out of school) and have laid aside your official pen, 
as Plebe representative, 1 am taking the liberty to 
say a few things to you and about you.
It is with eagerness I scan the columns of the 
Tartan for your work. How dearly I cherish those 
little scraps of your poetry, they are so pathetic. 
And how your quaint jokes and witticisms, how 
much they resemble Mark Twain, Bill Nye and Mr. 
Pfouts.
Though you were elected to represent us, you 
have not always done so. How often you have 
taken advantage of our misfortune and grossly mis­
represented us. I cannot, in ordinary English, ex­
plain how much I admire your nerve, you are so 
grand, so splendid, so magnetic, in your own esteem. 
Your name will live forever, you will never die a 
natural death.
Not alone are you a poet and a writer, but a phil­
osopher also, your logical conclusions or radical ar­
guments are beyond question, you do honor to a 
Pitt, a Daniel Webster or a S. S. Keller.
Knowing now that you no longer have the power 
of an unscrupulous press behind you, and cannot 
“get back” at me with a scathing criticism for my 
boldness, I dare to say that absence makes the 
heart grow fonder, and some day, perhaps, I will be 
able to forgive you. Until then honor to whom 
honor is due, tribute to whom tribute is due, and 
the funeral march for yours.
Without a snicker, remain yous forever.

MOVING PICTURES IN COLORS.
After the successful solution of the problem of 
color photography by the Lumiere brothers, the 
problem of color chronophotography seemed to be 
nearing its final solution. But the practical difficult­
ies encountered were far greater than- in ordinary 
photography. Flexible films of 100 feet and more in 
length must be handled instead of glass plates of 
limited size. On the other hand the Lumiere pro­
cess is suitable only for the making of transparen­
cies. Duplicate positives from a series of negatives 
are out of the question.
A novel system has recently been invented by a 
Roman painter, Signor Barricelli, for the cinemato­
graphic reproduction of animated scenes in their nat­
ural colors. The coloring of the films is obtained by 
means of the three-color process, but in a novel way. 
Instead of coloring the film itself, the inventor reach­
es his result by a rapid presentation of images, each 
of which is colored in one of the three fundamental
colors (red, yellow, blue). By virtue of the well- 
known phenomenon of visual persistence, these 
images will be give the impression of a complete 
three-color image.
In order to produce a given scene in its natural 
colors, it is sufficient to photograph the object three 
times through properly colored screens, each of which 
will allow only the light rays of a given color to pass. 
Thus three analytical color negatives are obtained. 
The corresponding positives printed from these nega­
tives in black and white must be projected in rapid 
succession on a white wall, each through the same 
color screen used in obtaining the negative. The eye 
will then perceive a multi-colored image, provided the 
rate of succession be such that the individual impres­
sions due to the various colors on the retina may 
superpose themselves on one another. The length of 
the photographic film as well as the speed of succes­
sion should accordingly be three times as great as in 
an ordinary cinematograph. The system adopted by 
Barricelli for insuring the succession of the various 
color screns in front of the objective, both during the 
taking of the views and during projection, is of re­
markable simplicity. A glass disk divided into three 
colored sectors according to the fundamental colors, 
red, yellow, blue, is rotated in front of the objective 
so as to change the screen at each move of the cine- 
matoraph shutter.—Scientific American.
WOODLAWN’S FIRE.
Those who have grown blasé and who complain of 
the humdrum of existence here at Tech were fur­
nished a little excitement to vary the monotony on 
Monday last.
A fire caused by some one of the various sources 
suggested started at Woodlawn Cottage and had 
gained some little headway before being discovered. 
The neighbors were the first to see the smoke, and 
telephoned in an alarm which the least distant 
fire companies responded to. As soon as the flames 
broke out almost every one seemed to wake up to 
the situation at once and a fairly complete roll of 
the Margaret Morrison and the Applied Science 
Schools could have been called on Woodlawn ave­
nue.
Although the usual stunts of throwing the type­
writer out of the window and carrying the bedclothes 
downstairs were not enacted, some almost as good 
were pulled off. A couple of good dog fights served 
to enliven the affair and Professor Wurts, ever calm, 
gave a demonstration of hunting for an open cir­
cuit in his motor cycle while affairs were at their 
height.
And about the fire. Well, the porch will have to 
be rebuilt and several of the boys had their clothes 
and room furniture considerably damaged by water. 
After the fire Managa Thomson could be seen 
hunting a clothesline on which to dry his wardrobe 
and Best decided that his effects couldn't get any 
worse, so he availed himself of the opportunity to 
take a few snap shots.

MISS CLARA L. WEST.
Following the announcement that Miss Smith de­
sired to be relieved from her position of Dean of the 
Margaret Morrison School, came a period of sus­
pense and speculation concerning her successor. 
Rumors of various kinds began to flit about and 
small talk and gossip suggested many names. It 
was noticed, however, that about three-fourths of 
the guessers said, “I told you so,” when it was an­
nounced that Miss West would have the important 
post next year.
As head of the Department of Household Arts, she 
has been connected with the Schools for two years. 
Most of her life has been spent abroad traveling 
with parties of young ladies finishing their education, 
with occasional returns to this country to deliver 
lectures. The work and ideals of the Margaret Mor­
rison School have been explained by her to many 
women’s clubs about the country.
In addition to this work, her lectures on litera­
ture, culture, and art have spread the fame of the 
school to a greater extent than would at first be 
imagined.
Versatile in the extreme, she has been known to 
inform the White Friars on such matters as the 
proper length of a ballet skirt, and half an hour 
later to be well on with a lecture to the Senior 
Girls on “The Ethical Influence of the Later Italian 
Renaissance.” To give a list of the places where she 
has lived would be to reprint the “Pronouncing 
Gazetteer” of Webster’s Unabridged.
Director Hamerschlag began a series of interest­
ing talks to the Senior Class on Monday morning
which he proposes to give during the spring term. 
On next Monday it is hoped that Mr. Alfred East, 
the English Artist, may be prevailed upon to ad­
dress the class. These talks come as the first since 
that distant date when we settled the Nebular Hy­
pothesis and listened to the reasons why a bridge 
pier should be cigar-shaped. Although we have 
forgotten why they should be cigar-shaped, and, al­
though we remember more about the thirst of the 
Romans than any other feature, yet we have missed 
these talks, so the Director will find himself ad­
dressing an appreciative audience, more especially, 
as we have his positive assurance that no examina­
tion will be given and attendance is not compul­
sory.
On a couple of previous occasions it has been 
necessary to speak of ungentlemanly conduct of a 
few whom the majority by their indifference allow 
to damage the reputation of the school and there 
is one form that seems to persist, and if possible is 
getting worse. This minority can be noticed at 
work most any afternoon when the Margaret Mor­
rison School girls are dismissed, although none 
seem safe from the attention (?) of the “gang.” 
Why is it that school that has so far maintained a 
record for clean sportsmanship and gentlemanly 
conduct on the athletic field will allow a few juve­
niles to damage its reputation in a point so vital?
CARNEGIE MECHANICAL SOCIETY.
The Mechanical Engineering students of the 
School of Applied Science have organized a society 
to be known as the Carnegie Mechanical Society. 
Meetings are to be held once a month and an ap­
plication has been made to the American Society 
of Mechanical Engineers for student membership.
At the last regular meeting held on Saturday 
evening after a small amount of routine business 
had been transacted, a communication from the 
American Society of Mechanical Engineers, was 
read, saying that the society’s application had been 
referred to the Executive Committee. After this 
Professor Trinks gave a short talk and the meeting 
adjourned.
Eighty-five students of the University of Wiscon­
sin were in Pittsburg last week visiting industrial 
plants about the city.

ANOTHER SPRING POEM.
By Some of Us.
The golden sun with gentle rays 
Doth turn the snow to slush 
On all the streets and alley ways.
The river banks are flush.
The robins with their cheery note,
The angleworms do pick,
And slide them gibly down their throat.
On every bush and stick 
The buds strive hard to burst the bond 
Of hard old winter’s chain.
The bullfrogs sleeping by the pond 
Will soon wake up again.
Old Grandma Brown sows lettuce seed, 
And mother sets the hens.
In expectation of a feed
The pigs squeal in their pens.
The chickens all work overtime,
And so does William Brown,
Not for the Easter Rabbit, but 
His wife’s new Easter gown.

THE SOUTH IS GOING DRY.
Lay the jest about the julep in the camphor balls 
at last,
For the miracle has happened and the olden days 
are past;
That which makes Milwaukee famous does not foam 
in Tennessee,
And the lid in Hoke Sjnith’s Georgia’s locked tight 
as tight can be
And the comic paper colonel and his cronies well 
may sigh,
For the whisky flows no longer and the South is 
going dry.
By the still side of the hillside in Kentucky all is 
still,
And the only damp refreshment must be dipped up 
from the rill.
Nowth Ca’lina’s stately ruler gives his soda glass a 
shove
And discusses local option with the So’th Ca’lina 
“guv.”
It is useless at the fountain to be winkful o’ the eye,
For the cocktail glass is dusty and the South is 
going dry.
It is water, water everywhere, and not a drop to 
drink;”
We no longer hear the music of the yellow crystal 
clink
When the colonel and the major and the gen’ral and 
the jedge
Meet to take a little nip and give their appetites an 
edge,
For the eggnog now is nogless and the rye has gone 
awry,
And the punchbowl holds carnations, for the South 
is going dry.
All the nightcaps now have tassels and are worn 
upon the head;
Gone the nightcaps that were taken when nobody 
went to bed;
And the breeze above the blue grass is as solemn 
as in death,
For it bears no pungent clove tang on its odorific 
breath ;
And each man can walk the chalk line when the 
stars are in the sky,
For the fizz glass now is fizzless and the South is 
going dry.
Lay the jest about the jiulep ’neath the chestnut 
tree at last,
For there’s but one kind of moonshine and the olden 
days are past.
The water wagon rumbles through the Southland 
on its trip,
And it helps no one to drop off to pick up the dri­
ver’s whip;
For the mint beds now are mintless and the corn 
screw hangeth high,
All is still along the still side, and the South is 
going dry.

PLAYING SAFE.
He made some blithe remarks about the weather, 
’Twas in a rhyme concerning gentle spring— 
And pondered if he’d take them off or whether 
To winter flannels still he’d fondly cling. 
Although the sun up in the sky was beaming,
He prudently declared, “Till March is gone,
I will not yield me to a poet’s dreaming,
And, come what will, I think I’ll keep them on.”

It has been definitely announced that the Girls’ 
Glee Club from the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School will take part in the program of the coming 
Glee and Mandolin Club Concert on April 30th. They 
have been under rehearsal for some time, and at the 
trial held last week, it was shown that they are 
doing a very high class of singing. The membership 
is about twenty and the drilling has been in charge 
of Miss Stoner of the' Women’s School. This will 
certainly prove a great attraction. In addition to 
this, the boys have developed some exceptionally 
good numbers, both by the Glee and the Mandolin 
Clubs. Every effort has been made to get into the 
best possible shape and there is no doubt that the 
high standard set by the Annual Concert will be 
continued. This concert is really in the nature of 
an encore, owing to the many requests from people 
who heard the one on February nineteenth.

Wernecke has patented a continuous automatic 
filter press divided into several compartments, which 
are arranged radially about a horizontal axis, form­
ing a polyhedral box. The outer end of each com­
partment is closed by^ a hinged and grooved plate 
covered with filter cloth. The inner end is of 
similar construction, and can be forced outward by 
a lever. The compartments are filled through pipes 
connected with one end of the hollow axis, and emp­
tied through pipes connected with the other end. 
The operations of filling, pressing and emptying are 
performed automatically as the apparatus is rotated. 
As each compartment arrives at its lowest position 
the outer end is opened and the press cake is ex­
pelled.—Scientific American.
THE WEATHER PROPHET.
Who always gets it in the neck whenever it is snow­
ing?
Who has his troubles by the peck when summer 
winds are blowing?
Who gets the blame for slush and ice and drouth 
and wind and so forth?
Who’s ridiculed in weather nice by all the folks that 
go forth?
Who, none the less, a record makes that’s splendid, 
altogether,
And proves to be no kin to fakes? He who for- 
casts the weather.
It always is a bully joke to roast the weather 
prophet;
It’s old as Egypt is, yet folk seem not to weary of it;
For instance, you yourself have made such bonmots 
bright and clever—
Was e’er a laugh to them gainsaid? Of course the 
answer’s “Never.”
Yet scarcely with trust we view his forecast, though 
we scoff at it—
The devil sometimes gets his due, but not the 
weather prophet.

12THE TARTAN
THE MAKING OF A TECHNICAL BOOK. 
By Richard K. Meade.
Editor of The Chemical Engineer.
No doubt, the first historian carved the story of 
wars and deeds of valor upon the walls of his city 
and its temples, in order that posterity might know 
of the prowess of his people and their rulers. No 
doubt, the first poet immortalized his songs and the 
first philosopher extended to future generations thé 
fame of his epigrams by transcribing them upon the 
leaf of a tree or the skin of an animal. So too, no 
doubt, the first chemist handed down to his pupils 
upon papyrus and parchment his rules and formulas 
for the transmutation of metals and the elixir of life. 
Certainly many books on chemistry and metallurgy 
were existent in the libraries of Roime, Greece, 
Egypt and Chaldea. No doubt, too, the secrets of 
the wonderful metal workers of Phoenicia constitut­
ed an early metallurgy, and the methods used in 
dyeing the wonderful fabrics with which Solomon 
adorned himself and the temple which he built 
were at one time the subject of some treatise upon 
chemical technology. It was a wise man of an era 
even before the coming of Christ who wrote, “of 
many books there is no end,” and certainly among 
these books there were many which treated of 
practical science and technology as well as of his­
tory, philosophy and art.
Of the .making of books there is still no end, and 
the technical book is still a respectable proportion 
of the number made. Of books there have always 
been many kinds, good books and bad books, books 
which were good literature with bad morals, and 
books whose morals were like Caesar’s wife, beyond 
reproach, but which were nevertheless bad litera­
ture. So, today, there are books which are good 
literature but bad technology and books which are 
good technology but bad from a literary standpoint. 
The former are largely the product of “hack” tech­
nology writers and the latter are often, we are sorry 
to say, produced by good practical chemists and 
engineers. It has in some cases been a fact that
good books on chemical technology were the pro­
duct of men who knew comparatively little of the 
practice of the subject about which they wrote. 
These writers were men, however, of excellent 
breadth of mind, who had at their command a large 
amount of technical literature, and who were con­
stituted with a judicial sense for weighing the liter­
ary productions of others, selecting the good from 
the bad in this, and placing the former before the 
reader in an evenly balanced and smoothly reading 
treatise. Such books contribute nothing to the 
world’s store of technical knowledge, but neverthe­
less constitute welcome additions to our technical 
libraries. Other books have been prepared by men 
of large experience in technology, yet they are sel­
dom consulted and would be even less so were they 
written by men not so distinguished as their authors. 
The reason for this is that the writers disregard all 
rules for technical writing and present their mater­
ial in a crude illogical way. Unqestionably the best 
book could be written by a man who knows the sub­
ject best. It is seldom a case of grammar and 
rhetoric, and not often a case of lack of facility in 
expressing themselves that makes books by these 
men failures. It is usually the neglect to look be­
fore they leap and to familiarize themselves with 
books before they write, as they would with a 
machine or a process before installing it in their 
plants.
When practical men have taken the time to study 
carefully the methods of book making they have 
usually, when they themselves wrote books, made 
noteworthy contributions to technical literature. 
Such books are not mere compilations, under one 
cover, of already existing data, but actually contri­
bute facts from the experience of the author, which 
enlarge the knowledge of the subject by just so 
much. It is seldom, however, that a technologist 
has written a whole ¡book out of his own head and 
all books are more or less compilations, pieced out 
here and there with new facts from the anthor’s 
own experience. Where the practical man usually 
gets far ahead of the hack writer is in his knowledge 
of where to get the information, and his ability to

THE TARTAN13
balance correctly and digest this material, disregard­
ing the spurious, often from the scientific papers 
of an authority, and presenting the abstract of what 
he finds in clear and brief language.
During the recent agitation over denatured al­
cohol, there was a demand for information upon 
the subject. The hack writers promptly began to 
prepare works to fill this demand. The literature 
of the patent office was gone over and the various 
German books upon the subject were studied indus­
triously, with the result that a few fairly acceptable 
works upon the subject of industrial alcohol were 
finally brought out; most of them, if indeed not all 
of them, by men who had had no experience either 
in the design or workings of a plant for the manu­
facture of alcohol. So it is in many branches of 
chemical technology. Gradually, however, the va­
rious industries are acquiring a literature which tells 
something and which is reliable.
The mere statement of facts does not make a book. 
The facts must be presented in logical order. They 
must be expressed in brief and grammatical English. 
There must be no ambiguity of meaning, and illustra­
tions should be used whenever necessary to give 
the reader a clear idea of an appliance. Enough 
must be said of each subject to explain it clearly 
to the reader, and yet he must not be wearied with 
useless repetitions. The fact must be given space 
proportional to their importance. Long argumenta­
tive discourses and defenses or explanations of the 
writer’s pet theories must be foregone. The place 
for such is in the transactions of scientific socie­
ties. To sum up, pick the class of men whom you 
are to write for, imagine yourself in their place and 
give them the information they wish. Don’t be 
afraid of being too elementary. The vast number of 
men who buy a book are not experts and they want 
information from A to M as well as from N to Z. 
The choice of how much elementary must be im­
parted will largely depend upon whom the book is 
written for, and here the writer must use judgment. 
A book on smoke combustion written for a chemical 
engineer will not need as much elementary chemis­
try as one written for a power house superintendent.
To the chemist or technologist who thinks he has 
it in him to write a good book, our first advice is to 
get together all the recognized standard books which 
he can obtain upon the 'subject about which he is 
to write and carefully study each. First decide if 
the book to be written covers identically the same 
field as any of those at present in print. If the 
field has already ben covered, the prospective book 
should be much better than its older competitor. 
Or if only as good, a more progressive publisher 
must be obtained for it, if from a business stand­
point it is to distance its competitors. Generally

speaking, however, technical treatises are written to 
fill gaps in technical literture and each new one 
which preceded it in the given field, or be written 
for a class of readers not reached by the older 
treatises, either because of price or method of 
treatment. There is often a need of a simple ele­
mentary manual where complete and exhaustive 
treatises are ummerous. Such books, however, re­
quire very clear and concise treatment and a 
knowledge of proportions not always possessed by 
new . writers.
The first step in the making of a technical book 
should always be the preparation of a complete 
bibliography of the subject, including fn this all 
papers of any value appearing in the transactions 
of the various scientific societies and in the tech­
nical press. This refreshes the author’s memory on 
many points and gives him an idea of where to go 
for reliable data on various subjects. It also allows 
him to give authority for his statements, and hence 
adds weight to what he says, and enables him to 
give proper credit for discoveries, theories, experi­
ments, etc.
An excellent method of assembling data is in the 
form of paragraphs, each appropriately headed and 
written upon separate sheets. When the data are 
all collected, these sheets can be arranged in system­
atic order and will form a skeleton of the book. 
The paragraphs can then be amplified and connected 
together by other paragraphs leading up to them. 
In this way the skeleton of the book can be filled 
out and the book in rough form completed. Next it 
should be carefully gone over, condensed or ampli­
fied as needed, and points where improvements can 
be made should be noted. The rough book is then 
ready for the final revision, which may sometimes 
be done with the aid of a stenographer. In this, 
care should be exercised as to the English and the 
clearness and conciseness of expression. Different 
writers, pursue different plans in technical book- 
making, but the above one will be well suited to the 
inexperienced author. Except for use as text books 
in schools or colleges, paragraphs need not be num­
bered.
Usually manuscript should be typewritten. Where 
the author’s handwriting is quite legible this is not 
imperative. All technical terms and proper names, 
however, should be very carefully written so that 
the printer will not mistake letters. Such mistakes 
are often overlooked in proof reading. The cost of 
typewriting a manuscript is not excessive. The 
usual price being about ten cents for a page of 
commercial paper containing about 300 words to 
the page. This would make the cost of t.vnewritmg

an octavo, 250-page book about $35. Proof correct­
ing is usually much lessened by typewritten manu­
script. Large tables can usually be best made by 
hand, but all figures should be perfectly distinct. 
Pages should, of course, be numbered and should 
be about 8x11 inches in size. Legal cap (8^x14) 
is somewhat large for book manuscript and it is 
hard for printers to set type from it.
The headings, size of page, type and binding of a 
book are matters which are usually left to the pub­
lishers. It is well, however, for the author in pre­
paring manuscript to have in view various headings 
under which his material is to be presented. Usu­
ally these will have different values. For instance, 
the chapter headings should be larger than those of 
a section or paragraph. All headings of the same 
value should be in the same size type. The head­
ings should classify the subject matter and should 
catch the eye of the reader. All that can be done, 
of course, in the manuscript is to indicate the rel­
ative values so that the headings can be put in the 
proper type. Italics are sometimes used for sub­
headings. Next to them come the Small Capitals 
and then the Large Capitals. Bold-face type is now, 
however, more used for headings than the three 
forms mentioned above. For paragraph headings, 
bold-face type is probably best as it catches the eye 
very promptly. In the manuscript, it is usual to in­
dicate paragraph headings by underscoring once. 
Headings to be in -small capitals are underscored 
twice and where a more prominent heading still is 
desired the words are underscored three times. 
Where typewritten manuscript is used, the impor­
tant headings can be indicated by using all capitals 
and the still more important headings by using the 
capitals and underscoring.
The size of the page depends entirely on the size 
of the book, the most usual is the octavo, or 8vo,
6 by 9 inches. The printed form of this is 4 by 6% 
inches. The duodecimo, or 12vo, has a form 3V2 by
6 inches and is used extensively for small books. 
PocketHbooks are usually 16mo with from 3V2 by 
5% inches. A royal octavo page is 4V2 by 7%, and 
is used for large .books such as dictionaries. A 
quarto book, 4to, has a form 6V2 by 8 inches and is 
suitable only for very large books, or books in which 
large plates must be used to illustrate or where wide 
tables are employed. It is an inconvenient book to 
handle.
