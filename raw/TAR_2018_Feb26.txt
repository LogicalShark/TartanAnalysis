Disney Research leaves CMU center, collaborations continue
ADAM TUNNARD
Staffwriter
Earlier this month, 
many were surprised 
to hear the news that 
Disney Research, a re-
search-focused sector of 
Walt Disney Company, 
would be leaving their 
lab here at Carnegie 
Mellon University. This 
lab, which collaborated 
with Carnegie Mellon 
University faculty on ev-
erything from robotics 
to sports visualization, 
housed itself in the Robert 
Mehrabian Collaborative 
Innovation Center, but has 
now closed its doors there 
indefinitely.
The Collaborative 
Innovation Center has 
served an important role 
as a bridge between the 
university and private sec-
tor research and innova-
tion. It is the home to many 
corporate partnerships 
and houses some of the 
most impactful research 
on campus. According to 
the dedication to benefac-
tor Robert Mehrabian, for-
mer president of Carnegie 
Mellon, the building was 
constructed to be a “busi-
ness incubator.” Since 
its construction, the 
Collaborative Innovation 
Center has been exactly 
that.
Disney’s time working 
at this location was cer-
tainly fruitful. In 2011, 
Carnegie Mellon faculty 
and Disney researchers 
collaborated to develop 
a new technology called 
Surround Haptics, a fully 
immersive tactile technol-
ogy that provides a 4D in-
teraction with movies or 
video games. This provides 
a large range of sensations 
with vibrating actuators, 
giving another layer of 
realism to the media we 
consume.
In 2015, the Pittsburgh 
lab announced a new 
suite of inexpensive physi-
cal additions to smart-
phones, aiding in their 
interactivity. The tech-
nology allowed things 
like knobs, sliders, and 
other tangible accessories 
to transform interaction 
with smartphone capabili-
ties, being incorporated 
into physically unlockable 
alarm clocks, and even 
responsive dolls.
Perhaps most notable 
of all the work to come out 
of the lab would be when 
a Disney creator stumbled 
upon a robotic arm 
made by Carnegie 
Mellon robotics professor, 
Chris Atkeson, and de-
cided to base a character 
around it. The character 
created went on to be 
Baymax, the protagonist 
of a critically-acclaimed 
Disney film Big Hero 6.
While it would make 
sense to mourn the leave 
of such a notable and im-
pactful company, it is im-
portant to note that com-
panies often have to pare 
back periodically; as Chris 
Atkeson notes, the leave 
was most likely “driven 
by overall cost reductions 
within the entire Disney 
family of companies to im-
prove quarterly earnings.”
Disney Research 
similarly closed the doors 
to a research facility in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts 
in 2015. A Disney repre-
sentative told The Boston 
Globe that Disney “regu-
larly evaluate[s] our 
organization to meet the 
evolving needs of our 
business.” The decision 
to close the Pittsburgh 
Disney research facility is 
not something unprece-
dented by Disney business 
standards, or particularly 
unforeseeable.
Additionally, the  
past relationship  be-
tween Carnegie Mellon 
University and Disney 
Research was not actually 
a formalized corporate 
partnership, as is being 
reported.

Survey by The Tartan reveals undergraduate budget priorities
ZACH GOLDSTEIN
Staffwriter
A recent survey by The 
Tartan of Carnegie Mellon 
undergraduate students 
reveals, perhaps unsurpris-
ingly, that students want 
the university to spend 
more on financial aid. 
And no survey is needed 
to know that students are 
bothered by the rising cost 
of tuition, which just this 
year saw an increase. But 
spending more on finan-
cial aid or lowering tuition 
would likely require the 
university to spend less 
on other budget items. 
The Tartan conducted a 
survey this past week in 
order to gauge the budget 
priorities of the student 
body and see where stu-
dents think changes should 
be made.
To conduct the survey, 
The Tartan asked what 
students think about the 
current level of funding 
going to research, faculty 
salaries, buildings, and 
recreational facilities. Re-
sponses were collected 
from 64 Carnegie Mellon 
undergraduates via stu-
dent Facebook groups 
and, as such, reflect the 
opinions of a group of 
voluntary undergraduate 
responders.
Constructing and 
renovating buildings was 
the item for which the 
most respondents said that 
Carnegie Mellon spends 
too much money, but even 
there, more respondents 
said that the amount of 
money spent on buildings 
is “just right” over “too 
much,” and many respon-
dents were unsure or had 
no opinion. This indicates 
an area where there is a 
fraction of students who 
think that the current ex-
pansion is too much, but a 
significant portion are not 
too concerned about the 
level of funding. One issue 
with adjusting the money 
being sent to this area is 
that many donors donate 
funds on the understand-
ing that they will be ear-
marked for a certain physi-
cal location where a plaque 
can be erected with their 
name on it, rather than 
more abstract needs for 
funding at the university.
Very few respondents 
believed that Carnegie 
Mellon should change its 
spending on recreational 
facilities, faculty salaries, 
or research. However, 
many respondents were 
unsure or had no opinion 
about spending in these 
areas as well. This might 
show that this is an area 
where undergraduates 
have less of an idea how 
much is being spent, and 
those that do are satisfied 
with current levels.
With faculty salaries in 
particular, the large ma-
jority of respondents were 
unsure or had no opinion. 
Paying faculty more might 
allow Carnegie Mellon to 
recruit better professors, 
or to lower class sizes by 
hiring more instructors. 
But like any spending in-
crease, raising spending 
on faculty salaries would 
likely require raising tu-
ition, and that is sure 
to be unpopular among 
students.
We also asked Carnegie 
Mellon students about 
their opinions of merit 
versus need-based scholar-
ships. While there is sup-
port for increasing both, in-
creasing merit scholarship 
funding is more popular. 
This might be due to low 
eligibility for need-based 
scholarships among survey 
respondents, although the 
survey did not ask about

STUDENT GOVERNMENT COLUMN
GREGORY VOLYNSKY
Special to The Tartan
Elections are right 
around the corner, and 
student government at 
Carnegie Mellon is a great 
way to get involved on 
campus and make an im-
pact on the community. 
This year, student govern-
ment has had a substantial 
effect on our campus, in-
cluding but not limited to :
• Pushing the add/drop 
deadline to six weeks in-
stead of two, as the admin-
istration proposed
• Facilitating the early 
release of final exam 
schedules
• Creating a Chrome 
extension that integrates 
Faculty Course Evaluation 
directly into SIO
• Opening up the 
Tartan Collaborative Com-
mons (TCC) on the 3rd 
floor of the Cohon Center
If you are passionate 
about improving campus 
life at Carnegie Mellon, 
if you have ideas on what 
can be done better, if you 
believe that we as a com-
munity can do better — or 
if you’re just interested in 
free food, elegant wear, 
and thoughtful discussion 
— student government is a 
great way to turn this pas-
sion, drive, and ideas into 
sustainable change. There 
are many roles available 
including Student Body 
President, Student Body 
Vice President of Organi-
zations, and Senator. We’ll 
be having a general inter-
est meeting on Feb. 26 at 
5:30 p.m. in Doherty Hall 
1212 to go over how to set 
up petitions and run for 
office. We hope to see you 
there!

Byron Spice, School of 
Computer Science Director 
of Media Relations, says 
that the lab “was owned 
and operated by Disney 
in space leased from the 
university,” and collabo-
rated with Carnegie Mellon 
faculty, but “was not a 
corporate partnership with 
the university.”
All this being said, 
Disney Research will 
continue to be conducted 
in their Los Angeles and 
Zurich locations, and 
Carnegie Mellon University 
will ?ll the space they left 
behind with something 
likely just as innovative, 
though perhaps with less 
of a magical ?air. Carnegie 
Mellon University will still 
continue to have a relation-
ship with Disney Research, 
though from distances far-
ther than a walk across the 
Cut.
Chris Atkeson is 
“looking forward to new 
corporate partners in that 
space,” referring to the 
potential for some other 
corporation to ?nd their 
home at Carnegie Mellon 
University. The future of 
the space is unknown, 
but judging on the past 
signi?cance of the work 
done in the Collaborative 
Innovation Center, the next 
undertaking will surely 
have comparable success.

Mass emails, which 
have detailed things such 
as a measles outbreak and 
a sniper threat in recent 
weeks, have often created 
more questions than they 
have answered. The most 
recent of these emails, 
announcing the creation 
of the Block Center for 
Technology and Society 
in the Heinz School for 
Information Systems and 
Public Policy, was no ex-
ception with little infor-
mation available about 
the role the Block Center 
will play at Carnegie 
Mellon. The principal dif-
ference is that this email, 
rather than detailing a cri-
sis on campus, outlined a 
new frontier for research 
at Carnegie Mellon.
The Block Center will 
be funded by a $15 million 
donation by Keith Block, 
vice Chairman, president, 
and COO of Salesforce, 
and his wife, Suzanne 
Kelley, vice president of 
Consulting Operations 
and Project Management 
Of?ce at Oracle. The cen-
ter, according to its bare-
bones website, will be 
“dedicated to the interdis-
ciplinary investigation of 
the economic, organiza-
tional, and public policy 
impacts of technology.”
Keith Block is an alum 
of the Dietrich College of 
Humanities and Social 
Science, graduating in 
1984 with a degree in 
Management and Policy 
Analysis and Information 
Systems, before receiv-
ing his master’s degree 
at the Heinz School for 
Information Systems and 
Public Policy in a ?ve-year 
accelerated degree pro-
gram. He has maintained 
close ties with the uni-
versity since then, serv-
ing on the Heinz College 
Dean’s Advisory Board, 
setting up the Keith Block 
Entrepreneurship Fund 
at Heinz, and support-
ing efforts to renovate 
Hamburg Hall, the home 
of Heinz College. Block 
was labeled, according to 
a Heinz College press re-
lease by former Carnegie 
Mellon President Subra 
Suresh at the dedica-
tion of a classroom in 
Hamburg Hall to him, as 
one of Carnegie Mellon’s 
“most avid proponents.”
Block stated in a 
Carnegie Mellon press 
release that he felt that 
the Block Center meets a 
need to examine the ex-
pansion and innovation 
happening in the world 
and that Carnegie Mellon 
is an ideal place to carry 
out that mission: “Innova-
tion delivers powerful ad-
vancements that will have 
a profound impact on ev-
eryone... CMU sits at the 
intersection of technology 
and policy — uniquely po-
sitioned to bring together 
the public and private sec-
tors to make the world a 
better place.”
The intersection of 
technology and policy 
to which Block refers is 
exempli?ed by the work 
done at Heinz, which is the 
locus for graduate studies 
for both information sys-
tems and public policy at 
Carnegie Mellon. The mis-
sion of the Block Center 
is to provide resources 
to this interdisciplinary 
study of technology and 
society, with interim pres-
ident Farnam Jahanian 
stating in his university-
wide email that “the 
Block Center will allow 
for a deeper connection 
between the many CMU 
programs focused on 
exploring the impact of 
technology on the hu-
man condition, bringing 
together thought leaders 
from across campus and 
around the world to tackle 
complex issues such as the 
future of work.”
Carnegie Mellon 
University sends hun-
dreds of students from 
every college each year 
to work in the tech sec-
tor, with a recent release 
of 2017 MBA employment 
statistics showing that 43 
percent of Tepper School 
of Business graduate stu-
dents ?nd jobs in the ?eld 
of technology. With this 
contribution comes a re-
sponsibility to understand 
how those students’ work 
will impact society. As in-
terim president Farnman 
Jahanian said in a Carn-
egie Mellon press release, 
“foreseeing and address-
ing the challenges posed 
by the rapidly increasing 
role of technology in our 
lives is a critical focus of 
our work here at Carnegie 
Mellon.”
respondents’ scholarship 
eligibility.
It is surprising that 
nearly a quarter of respon-
dents believed that the 
amount of money spent 
on need-based scholar-
ships is “just right,” given 
that Carnegie Mellon 
lags behind peer institu-
tions in this area. While 
many universities, like 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, Northwestern 
University and many 
more, meet all of a 
student’s demonstrated 
need, Carnegie Mellon 
does not. Along a simi-
lar vein, Carnegie Mellon 
is notable among top 
colleges for not partici-
pating in the QuestBridge 
program, which matches 
high-achieving, low-in-
come students with elite 
schools offering them full 
scholarships to attend.
Any change in Carnegie 
Mellon’s budget would 
require tradeoffs to be 
made. And while ideally 
Carnegie Mellon would 
be able to spend more 
in every area where stu-
dents feel there should be 
more spending, in reality 
administrators must 
carefully consider which 
items to prioritize when 
making decisions about 
the university’s budget.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Sports Illustrated is still exploiting feminism
The topic of women’s issues 
and bodies has garnered a lot 
of attention recently. In the 
case of the 2018 Sports Illus-
trated Swimsuit Edition, we 
are faced with a conversation 
involving both. Following the 
events of last spring surround-
ing both the controversial po-
litical climate and the feminist 
movement that passionately en-
sued in succession, MJ Day and 
her team at Sports Illustrated 
began working on what would 
be the 2018 Swimsuit Edition of 
the magazine with the intention 
of empowering women and 
changing preconceived notions 
about them. However when 
the issue hit stands, the world 
had more to say about the 
problematic implications 
of the portrayal of female 
empowerment and how it 
clashed with feminist ideol-
ogy than they did about the 
celebration of women the issue 
attempted to spotlight.
Editor of the iconic, beloved, 
and infamous Swimsuit Edition 
of Sports Illustrated, MJ Day 
holds a spot as one of the most 
influential creative heads of 
the magazine. Having worked 
at Sports Illustrated for two 
decades, Day has been a part 
of the process since before 
any substantial conversation 
of change was brought to the 
table. Day sought to widen the 
standards of women that were 
being pushed to be printed 
on the glossy pages of the 
magazine by fighting for more 
diversity and size inclusivity 
highlighted in their annual best-
selling issue. Twenty years later, 
Day works to make her vision 
take shape through a project 
she pioneered, with the help of 
an all female staff, titled In Her 
Own Words. The project features 
nude models posed and painted 
with words of their choosing, 
giving them artistic control and 
agency in how they label and 
express their personal empow-
erment. With current events 
in mind such as the #MeToo 
movement and a personal 
ideology formed from years of 
working as a woman under a 
male-centric publication, Day 
had a vision of altering the sta-
tus quo of the Swimsuit Edition 
from within through an act of 
female empowerment in a time 
of female liberation.
So how have we found our-
selves criticizing a project for lack of feminist ingenuity from a 
woman who claims she is aiming to fulfill that very agenda? The 
answer lies in the fact that not 
all ideas translate properly. In 
this case, the intentions behind 
the project did not read the 
same as the final result. In the 
context of a publication such as 
Sports Illustrated, the spread sat 
nestled between other salacious 
photo shoots curated for male 
consumers, the promise of 
change seemed more like a 
selling point than an honest 
ideological shift.
The feminist title seemed 
demeaned and commercialized 
as it claimed to stand as 
a fighting testament to 
misogyny while at the same 
time being published within 
a magazine that continuously 
neglected those concerns. 
Sports Illustrated has notably 
capitalized on the marketing of 
sexual images of women while 
disregarding scandals against 
their photographers, such as 
sexual assault accusations made 
against celebrity photographer 
and Sports Illustrated veteran 
Terry Richardson. Their heavy 
emphasis on the “progressive-
ness” of a project fully in the 
hands of women seemed to 
only mock the idea further, 
making it seem as if that were 
an extraordinary feat which 
justified their ability to call 
it feminism rather than truly 
celebrating it. People are not 
angry that this project has 
women finding liberation in 
their nakedness, but they are 
angry that they do so in a maga-
zine that is capitalizing off of 
that freedom by simultaneously 
giving a platform to standards 
that oppress them. Woman 
or not, Day’s idea to reform a 
magazine with a historically 
exploitative portrayal of 
women through a visual nar-
rative seemed naive — if 
not insulting — to many, 
and brings us to question 
feminism in the context of 
where it is used.
The issue here is not 
about male-dominated 
brands or corporations 
delving into the realm of 
feminist conversation, but 
is instead about the capi-
talization of feminism and 
the hypocrisy of their ethics 
in contrast to the ideology 
they are claiming to pro-
mote. It is no secret that 
female owned corporations 
have committed these same 
infractions in the past; Sophia 
Amoruso and Miki Agrawal, 
CEOs of Nasty Gal and Thinx 
respectively, have both been 
rightly condemned for their 
false activism after stories 
arose about their company 
policies neglecting maternity 
leave and affordable health 
plans along with hostile work 
environments arose. Feminism 
is not exclusive to any gen-
der and falsifying activism 
for the sake of good standing 
is not a new concept, but is 
feminism in practice not a vi-
able option for successful cor-
porations? Similarly, within 
Sports Illustrated, the inclusion 
of feminist perspectives seems 
impossible to put in action 
without compromising its 
credibility. How, in this case, 
can we applaud the good in 
bringing forth a conversation 
on feminism previously miss-
ing within their audience while 
also holding those in power 
responsible for their deceptive 
and manipulative tactics of 
commercializing it? Are we 
unable to merge discourse on 
feminism into the mainstream 
agenda without sacrificing the 
cause for the sake of exposure in 
the process? Ultimately, is this a 
step forward or a step backward 
for feminism?
Although the progress is 
tedious, frustrating, and at 
times heartbreakingly slow, 
progress is progress regardless, 
and the small steps forward 
cannot be taken for granted. 
It is our job as members of a 
larger community to shape the 
conversations of these issues 
by being vocal on where we 
stand to make clear the ever 
changing language of social 
politics. While the question-
able tactics of Sports Illustrated 
and their nude homage to the 
feminist narrative continue to 
be a topic of controversy, it is 
important to remember that 
not every person lives their 
liberty the same way. Some find 
empowerment in modesty and 
others find empowerment in 
nudity, however the final goal 
of our agency in making that 
choice is the same. We can-
not expect every woman who 
chooses to share their viewpoint 
to engender our notion of femi-
nism. Instead we should hold 
its meaning open to healthy 
discourse indicative of our 
diverse views. If any good has 
come out of the 2018 Swimsuit 
Edition of Sports Illustrated, 
it is seen in the conversations 
that have followed its shocking 
debut. Sometimes we must 
weigh the cost of trading in 
exposure for exploitation and 
weigh at what cost we may 
sacrifice these things.

President Donald Trump is 
?nding himself in a time crunch 
yet again. With so much on his 
agenda, he has shaken up Ameri-
ca with a presidency and admin-
istration like no other in Ameri-
can history. Now, it is his time to 
propose a budget for the ?scal 
year of 2019. Already, his plan 
has not been sitting well with 
many Americans.
Part of the proposed budget 
includes a two-year elimination 
of federal funding for the Cor-
poration for Public Broadcasting 
(CPB), which provides federal 
funding for the Public Broadcast-
ing Service (PBS) and National 
Public Radio (NPR) stations. Per-
haps, Trump sees this as a way 
to shave off $300 billion in new 
spending. Maybe, he has faith 
that private donations — cur-
rently CPB’s primary source of 
funding — will more than com-
pensate for federal contributions. 
Although NPR and PBS probably 
aren’t going to fall into oblivion 
should the budget pass, it is im-
portant to realize what kind of 
message Trump is sending by 
completely ending federal fund-
ing for CPB, even if it is for only 
two years.
When the founding fathers 
wrote the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, they put freedom of 
speech as the First Amendment 
for a reason. They wanted to have 
a country founded on democratic 
values where each man can pur-
sue “life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness”. Although we, as 
a society, are trying to expand 
those pursuits to everyone in 
America, one thing has remained 
true: we want to keep a demo-
cratic society. What do democrat-
ic regimes require that nondem-
ocratic regimes lack? Personal 
freedoms and an open press.
Now, the First Amendment 
is not some sort of invincibility 
cloak that allows you to ?ee any 
possible consequence. However, 
the First Amendment protects 
the rights of Americans to ex-
press their minds and be a part 
of the society in which they live 
in. Sure, someone has the right 
to be offended or give some sort 
of negative response to whatev-
er you have to say, but the First 
Amendment gives you that same 
right to say those things to begin 
with.
By pulling out all federal 
support from CPB, the White 
House is saying that it has better 
things to spend its money on 
than the core fundamentals of 
democracy. This, in combina-
tion with our current president’s 
love of the term “fake news,” and 
the Federal Communications 
Commission’s (FCC) decision to 
end net neutrality, all comes to 
suggest that the current admin-
istration wants to discourage the 
First Amendment.
Trump has not shown him-
self to be a huge believer in the 
First Amendment, to begin with. 
He threatened to end the John-
son Amendment, “open up” libel 
laws so that he could sue journal-
ists who gave him negative cover-
age and “win lots of money,” and, 
of course, he loves the usage of 
the term “fake news.” Of course, 
Trump has every right to feel 
dissatis?ed with how the press 
covers him and clear up any fal-
sities as he deems ?t. However, 
his tactics are beyond critiquing 
journalism or press coverage. 
His plan to end funding for CPB 
was the cherry on top of his anti-
media sundae.
The budget has yet to fully 
go through, and there are far 
more aspects that need discus-
sion. However, without freedom 
of speech, we cannot bring these 
topics into perspective. A democ-
racy is supposed to be run by the 
people, for the people. If Trump 
cuts off this circulation, he puts 
the future of America at stake.

Someone recently asked me 
“where do you see yourself be-
ing when you’re 30?” The ?rst 
thing that came to my mind, and 
my response, was “I think I’ll be 
a mom.” He then went on to ask 
if I had any other goals, plans to 
travel, etc. and I began to feel a 
bit guilty. Here I am at Carnegie 
Mellon spending countless hours, 
and dollars, to get a degree and 
my ?rst thought for what I’ll end 
up doing in ten years is pushing a 
baby around in a stroller. So many 
women before me have paved the 
way for me to even be here earn-
ing a degree and it seems a dis-
grace to not use it to the fullest.
But what if for me, using it to 
the fullest just means working 
a normal job and eventually go-
ing down the path of the classic 
“American dream” of being a mom 
and wife living in a white picket 
fence home? Does this make me a 
bad feminist? Is it not a bit hypo-
critical to not exercise the same 
freedoms that I ?ght for everyone 
to have? It can feel a bit burden-
some to be the one feminist at the 
rally that’s thinking, maybe being 
a stay-at-home mom isn’t so bad.
With feminism, it seems that 
unless you want the whole kit and 
caboodle it’s not enough and any 
nonfeminist tendencies you have 
are just a result of internalized 
misogyny. This is completely true 
in a lot of cases — for example, 
the woman who slut-shames — 
but I hardly think that my mother-
hood goals are because I was told 
I had to. I grew up in a generation 
where single mothers, including 
my own, did it all. My mother had 
a lot of support from my other 
family members including my 
amazing father, but much of the 
day-to-day parenting was done 
by her and I think my fascination 
with motherhood comes from 
wanting to give another human 
being even just a tiny fraction of 
all that my mother has given me.
In today’s society, these -isms 
can feel a bit constricting and 
binding. Someone either is a 
feminist or isn’t; one doesn’t 
just have feminist views. This 
extremism can be isolating to sev-
eral different people. With white 
feminist having the loudest voice, 
it can be hard to hear the rest of 
us. I’ll be honest, there are some 
feminist issues that I don’t care 
about at all, one of them being 
female body hair. I completely 
understand that it is just used as 
another tool to police women, 
but it can be hard for me to sup-
port the movement of something 
so trivial when black women are 
still miles behind white women 
in society. White women have 
attained a certain level of equal-
ity that allows them to focus on 
the smaller issues whereas black 
women are still 12 cents behind 
white women in the wage gap. 
We’re not really all ?ghting the 
same ?ght and overlooking these 
differences to unite us for one 
movement can be destructive in 
the effort to eliminate them.
Feminism isn’t the only move-
ment that can feel isolating if 
you’re views are a bit wavering. 
Take capitalism for example. I 
can’t count the number of times 
I’ve said: “I hate capitalism.” 
I’ve tweeted this from my Apple 
iPhone, I’ve said it while buying 
coffee at Starbucks, and I’ve said 
it in the checkout line in Walmart. 
We’re all enrolled in a four-year 
university with hopes of getting 
good-paying jobs on the promise 
that Carnegie Mellon students 
earn more than students from 
other colleges upon graduation. 
It can be hard to ?ght a system 
that’s so easy to support and as 
a student enrolled in a private 
university, so do I even have the 
right to oppose it or have I already 
cemented myself as a cog in the 
larger capitalist machine?
I don’t want to sell out to the 
man, but I recognize that I am do-
ing exactly what society told me 
to do. By just existing, I’m unin-
tentionally further perpetuating 
the idea that you have to gradu-
ate high school, go to college, 
and get a job to be a contributing 
member of society. So how do I 
reconcile what I believe with 
what I’ve done? I’ve already 
given stores like Walmart 
countless dollars and no 
matter how long my short 
stints of “I’m not shop-
ping at Walmart” last, I 
always crack either out of 
convenience or ?nancial 
reasons. I like to think that 
once I’m in a ?nancial posi-
tion to be able to choose to not 
shop at Walmart that I will, but 
there’s still an element of conve-
nience provided by capitalism.
But I think that what we 
choose to ?ght for can combat 
what we choose to do. I don’t 
think that everyone has to live life 
the same way as I did and I’ll con-
tinue to ?ght for other’s rights to 
live life as differently as they want 
to. I may be just a part of the sys-
tem, but I hope to use my position 
as a private university graduate 
to advocate for those that aren’t. 
The onus should be on those who 
have the means to do more to 
do more than those who do not. 
While it might not be our place to 
be the face of the movement, that 
doesn’t mean we cannot be the 
forces behind it.
I hope that my goals don’t em-
barrass women, but I shouldn’t 
have to sacri?ce what I want 
to still be considered feminist. 
I know I’m not the avid anti-
capitalist that I think I am, but I 
also know that it would be more 
dangerous to ignore this move-
ment and pretend it doesn’t exist. 
We shouldn’t let these movements 
polarize us so much that we think 
it’s not worth the ?ght if we aren’t 
all in. We might not be leading 
the wars but that doesn’t mean 
we shouldn’t do our part to ?ght 
in the battles.
Proposed SNAP food packages are insulting, detrimental
SARAH ELIZABETH BENDER
Once again, the flu strikes. 
For someone who spends an 
awful lot of time finding ways 
to squirrel away savings into 
the pockets of his absurdly rich 
billionaire buddies, President 
Donald Trump seems more than 
comfortable chipping away at 
the safety nets in place for those 
less fortunate than himself. His 
latest target: the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program 
(SNAP), colloquially known as 
food stamps.
SNAP provides families whose 
income falls beyond the poverty 
line with the means to purchase 
additional food to supplement 
what they can afford on their 
budget. They can buy vari-
ous food products at a number 
of retailers across the country 
with the money put on an elec-
tronic benefit transfer card each 
month. More than 42.2 million 
Americans rely on the program, 
many of whom are children, el-
derly, disabled, or homeless. And 
Trump plans to cut funding for 
the program by nearly 30 percent 
— more than $213 billion — over 
the next decade.
To do this, he wants to have 
the federal government send 
packages of food to recipients, 
a delivery that would make up 
about half of their benefits. The 
goal is that the food delivered 
would be cheaper than that pur-
chased individually through re-
tailers — thus saving the govern-
ment money — as well as more 
nutritious.
But these magical, cheap packages are nowhere near as 
perfect as they may seem to 
Trump. For one thing, they are 
projected to contain “shelf-stable 
milk, ready to eat cereals, pasta, 
peanut butter, beans and canned 
fruit and vegetables.” These 
choices limit options for picky 
eaters. They are full of items that 
those who are lactose intoler-
ant or allergic to nuts or other 
ingredients, who have celiac’s 
disease, or who suffer from other 
dietary restrictions cannot have. 
And they do not include kosher 
or halal options or alternatives to 
more sugary foods like the fruits 
for diabetics. Taking half of these 
people’s benefits away and giv-
ing them food they cannot eat in 
return will have catastrophic re-
sults on their monthly budgets — 
and their health.
That doesn’t even account for 
the homeless on SNAP, who have 
no place to store a box of food 
meant to last an entire month 
and no place to cook the ingre-
dients included as part of the 
package. It’s already difficult for 
the homeless to survive on SNAP 
since the program doesn’t usu-
ally cover pre-made meals from 
stores or fast-food restaurants. 
Without a pantry and a fridge to 
store the contents of the pack-
age until it can be eaten, recipi-
ents will struggle to keep and 
consume their package over the 
course of the month.
Furthermore, while the focus 
on healthy food may seem like 
a good way to target obesity 
and improve the overall health 
of those on benefits, healthier 
foods actually have far fewer 
calories, and thus give consum-
ers far less energy, than high-
calorie “junk” food, according to 
The New York Times. According 
to a study by University of Wash-
ington researchers, enough food 
to satisfy a 2,000-calorie diet can 
be obtained for just $3.52 a day 
— as long as the foods are ener-
gy-dense, high-calorie items like 
baked goods and snacks.
But when you 
buy enough foods 
with lower calories 
to meet a 2,000 
calorie diet, the 
price increases to 
around $36.32 a 
day. The chances 
that these gov-
ernment-picked 
packages, which 
are meant to con-
tain healthier 
food rather than 
chips and cookies 
and still be cheap 
enough to drasti-
cally cut the price 
of the program, 
will contain enough calo-
ries for people to make 
it through the day is ex-
tremely unlikely.
The packages will also 
take business away from 
local grocery stores and 
farms who currently accept food 
stamps in communities. Many 
small businesses accept food 
stamps, particularly in rural ar-
eas, as a significant part of their 
income. But with the money 
SNAP recipients receive cut in 
half each month, these stores 
would see a decrease in business.
Even the projected cheaper 
price of this initiative is probably 
too good to be true. Admittedly, 
it is likely that the government 
can obtain the food for a frac-
tion of the price retailers sell it 
for. An existing program that 
sends boxed food to low-income 
seniors — the program that 
Trump’s plan is modeled from — 
costs the government around $22 
for a box that might cost $40 to 
$50 if purchased elsewhere. But 
the program for seniors operates 
on a small, local scale — in order 
to generalize it to everyone on 
SNAP, other costs would begin to 
appear.
For example, these cheaper 
prices do not account for the cost 
of packaging and delivering the 
boxes to recipients. The exist-
ing program for seniors relies on 
volunteers to pack the boxes and 
distribute them from pickup cen-
ters and low-income apartment 
buildings — but local agencies 
probably don’t have the resourc-
es to deliver millions of boxes to 
those receiving benefits on their 
own. On the large-scale level of 
SNAP, paid employees would 
likely be needed to oversee dis-
tribution.
Additional complications 
arise from this model, too. How 
are homebound seniors, those 
unable to carry a heavy box by 
themselves, or those in rural 
areas without transportation 
meant to pick up their packages 
each month? What about people 
who work during the hours of 
pickup and can’t take off? If peo-
ple are hired to deliver packages 
to their homes, these people will 
have to be paid as well. And if 
picking up the packages is simply 
deemed a personal problem to be 
dealt with on an individual basis, 
many recipients will be unable 
to do so and will go hungry as a 
result.
People who are more well off 
than those on SNAP have already 
shown distaste for the idea of re-
ceiving boxed meals. Blue Apron, 
a high-end meal kit delivery ser-
vice that many are comparing to 
Trump’s proposal, had a notori-
ously low stock in 2017 and has 
struggled to hold onto customers. 
To assume that poorer people are 
better suited to the lack of 
options and the specific 
ingredients of a pre-pack-
aged set of meals — to 
take away the agency of 
people in this way, even as 
those on SNAP are repeat-
edly told to become more 
independent and take care 
of themselves — is full of 
misplaced distrust and 
even outright contempt 
for the poor.
Trump’s spontaneous 
and unexpected proposal 
shows a typical lack of 
thought for real con-
sequences and consid-
eration of the realities 
people face, like so many 
of his ideas so far into 
his presidency. His 
military parade, which 
would cost tens of mil-
lions of dollars, is an-
other recent idea that 
is equally as out-of-
touch as this one. But 
perhaps these ideas 
are related in another 
way as well. About 
seven percent of all 
veterans (around 1.5 
million) and between 
one and two percent 
of all active-duty military mem-
bers (between 2,000 and 22,000 
members) used food stamps in 
2012. Maybe Trump should com-
mit to helping them, along with 
other SNAP recipients, rather 
than staging his grand display of 
power.
The number of people receiv-
ing SNAP benefits has actually 
decreased in recent years. After 
spiking in 2013 after the 2008 
Great Recession, the number of 
recipients has gone down more 
than 5 million. Hopefully, it will 
continue of fall as more people 
find full-time jobs and get back 
on their feet.
But if that’s not enough — if 
we still want to do more to de-
crease the number of federal 
dollars spent on the poor, and to 
help improve the quality of life 
for lower-income Americans — 
there are other ways, ways that 
have already produced positive 
results, that we can do so. We can 
make sure that schools provide 
free meals to children to take 
some of the burden off poorer 
parents — and address the shame 
surrounding such programs, so 
children feel comfortable tak-
ing advantage of the option. We 
can create community gardens 
in food deserts, areas where 
there are no grocery stores with 
healthy, affordable foods so that 
people in those areas have more 
options when it comes to meals.
We can also look into “housing 
first” options, which seek to de-
crease the amount spent on SNAP 
benefits, incarceration, medical 
treatment, and other expenses 
by addressing homelessness in 
communities. In many cases, 
it’s cheaper — and obviously 
far more humane — to provide 
homeless men and women with 
permanent housing rather than 
leaving home on the streets. A 
Florida study from 2014 showed 
a 68 percent reduction in cost be-
tween homeless people and those 
provided housing. Another study 
focusing on a program in Char-
lotte, North Carolina showed 
similar results: a 78 percent re-
duction in emergency room vis-
its, a 79 percent reduction in hos-
pital stays, 84 percent fewer days 
in jail, and a 78 percent drop in 
arrests. Off the streets, partici-
pants in housing first programs 
can regain their dignity, focus 
on any mental health issues, and 
concentrate on finding and keep-
ing jobs more easily thanks to in-
creased stability.
Plus, with pantries, fridges, 
and stoves, people will be able to 
store excess food, cook ingredi-
ents, and even explore healthier 
options on their own. They will 
no longer be in a position that al-
lows Donald Trump and his abu-
sive, out-of-touch government to 
do it for them.

Genetic matches for the Taino found in modern Caribbeans
EMMA FLICKINGER
Assistant SciTech Editor
Members of the Taino 
culture, indigenous to the 
Caribbean, have maintained 
their cultural history for 
hundreds of years through 
oral tradition. It is believed 
that the Taino were the in-
digenous people present on 
the coast of America when 
Christopher Columbus “dis-
covered” it in 1492. 
After 50 years of living 
together, the relationships 
between the Taino and the 
colonizers began to crum-
ble, and the Taino popula-
tion began to drop. Ricardo 
Alegría, a Puerto Rican re-
searcher, claims in a 2011 
interview with Smithsonian 
Magazine that, “Their cul-
ture was interrupted by dis-
ease, marriage with Spanish 
and Africans, and so forth, 
but the main reason the In-
dians were exterminated as 
a group was sickness... By 
1519, a third of the aborigi-
nal population had died be-
cause of smallpox.” As time 
passed, colonization did 
more harm than good to the 
Taino people and, by the ear-
ly 1500s, according to some 
controversial records, more 
than 85 percent of their pop-
ulation was wiped out. In 
fact, with the publication of 
some recent archaeological 
evidence, most researchers 
insisted that the Tainos were 
an extinct people.
“According to Spanish 
accounts, we went extinct 
30 years after [European] 
contact,” says Jorge Estevez, 
an expert on Taino cultures 
at the Smithsonian Institu-
tion’s National Museum of 
the American Indian. His-
torians and anthropologists 
usually cite disease and 
brutalization as the cause of 
Taino extinction.
A sizable percentage of 
people in the Caribbean 
lay claim to indigenous an-
cestry, and still participate 
in traditional Taino cul-
tural practices, but many 
researchers still insist that 
they are not truly Taino de-
scendants. 
Though genetic surveys 
of these people reveal DNA 
signatures indicative of in-
digenous origins, most re-
searchers believed this was 
because they were really de-
scended from native North 
Americans brought to the 
Caribbean as slaves.
This perception may ?-
nally change as undeniable 
genetic evidence comes to 
light.
A thousand-year-old 
skeleton that belonged to 
a Taino woman, found in a 
cave in the Bahamas, has 
had its genome sequenced 
in extreme detail, providing 
far more precise insight into 
Taino DNA than ever be-
fore. It’s the most complete 
precontact Taino genome 
ever analyzed. And when 
researchers compared her 
genome to those of modern 
Puerto Ricans, the resem-
blance was undeniable.
“It’s almost like the 
ancient Taino individual 
they’re looking at is the 
cousin of the ancestors of 
people from Puerto Rico,” 
says Maria Nieves-Colón, a 
geneticist who studies an-
cient and modern Caribbean 
populations at the National 
Laboratory of Genomics for 
Biodiversity in Irapuato, 
Mexico.
“These indigenous 
communities were writ-
ten out of history,” says 
Jada Benn Torres, a genetic 
anthropologist at Vanderbilt 
University. 
“They are adamant about 
their continuous existence, 
that they’ve always been [on 
these islands]. So to see it re-
?ected in the ancient DNA, 
it’s great.”
By analyzing the Taino 
woman’s genes, the re-
searchers were able to de-
termine that her people 
were not inbred, restricted 
to the small island she lived 
on — instead, they spanned 
many islands in a wide trade 
network. “It looks like an 
interconnected network of 
people exchanging goods, 
services, and genes,” says 
William Schaffer, a bioar-
chaeologist at Phoenix Col-
lege who helped excavate 
the remains. “You know 
what? These people didn’t 
disappear,” says Nieves-
Colón. “In fact, they’re still 
here. They’re in us.”

The thousand-year old tooth of a Taino woman was found in the Preacher’s Cave in Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The Taino were beileved to have 
lived in Cuba, Trinidad, Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico and have extensive contact with people beyond those areas.
Chameleons have ?uorescent heads
Scientists have discov-
ered that many chameleons 
have ?uorescent bumps on 
their heads that glow under 
ultraviolet (UV) light. Da-
vid Prötzel, a herpetologist 
at Zoologische Staatssam-
mlung München in Germa-
ny, investigated the odd ?u-
orescent bumps after seeing 
a picture on Flickr of a cha-
meleon under UV light. In 
the photo, taken by photog-
rapher Paul Bertner, three 
tiny bumps on the chame-
leon’s head were glowing.
Though scientists have 
long known that chame-
leon heads often have bony 
bumps, “we were always 
wondering about [their 
function],” says Prötzel. He 
and his colleagues shone UV 
light on hundreds of cha-
meleons, and most of them 
had ?uorescent bumps. “We 
found that many species ?u-
oresce with an even larger 
pattern on their heads” than 
the chameleon in Bertner’s 
photo, Prötzel says.
The bony bumps on the 
chameleons’ heads aren’t 
bioluminescent — the light 
doesn’t come from chemi-
cal reactions within the 
chameleon’s body. Instead, 
it comes from the fact that 
the bone is naturally ?uo-
rescent. The chameleons 
only have a single extremely 
thin layer of skin on top of 
the bony bumps, letting the 
bone’s natural ?uorescence 
shine through.
Chameleons from forests 
were more likely to have the 
bumps than chameleons in 
open areas. 
Prötzel and his colleagues 
believe this is because shad-
ed forests have more ambi-
ent UV light, making the 
bumps more visible to other 
chameleons. Their function 
is unknown.
Researchers believe that 
other chameleons can see 
the ?ourescence.

Amateur captures supernova photo
When observing the 
night sky with a telescope, 
the chances of witnessing 
the beginning of a super-
nova are between one in ten 
million. Amateur astrono-
mer and locksmith Víctor 
Buso beat the odds when, 
while trying out a new cam-
era, he captured a photo of 
a gigantic star beginning to 
die.
Buso was photographing 
the galaxy NGC 613 on Sept. 
20, 2016, in Rosario, Argen-
tina, when he noticed that 
a dot of light had appeared 
in one of the photos. He 
checked the rest of the pho-
tos and realized that the dot 
was growing brighter. 
According to the 
Smithsonian Magazine, this 
might be the ?rst time a pho-
tograph of the early phases 
of a supernova have been 
taken. Previous phtographs 
document the few minutes 
right after a supernova for-
mation, but never the early 
moments. When astrono-
mer Melina Bersten of the 
Instituto de Astrofísica de 
La Plata learned of Buso’s 
photographs, she contacted 
astronomers around the 
world to make sure that the 
supernova was properly 
documented, and helped 
organize a coherent study. 
The of?cial description of 
the supernova, dubbed SN 
2016gkg, was published this 
week in Nature.
SN 2016gkg was clas-
si?ed as a Type II super-
nova and determined to 
have originated from a star 
roughly 20 times the mass of 
the sun. 
“Observations of stars in 
the ?rst moments they begin 
exploding provide informa-
tion that cannot be directly 
obtained in any other way,” 
said University of California,  
Berkeley astronomer Alex 
Filippenko. “It’s like winning 
the cosmic lottery.”

Neanderthals had symbolic thought
A recent report published 
in Science, claims that the art 
discovered in the caves of 
Spain dates back to 64,800 
years ago, which was at least 
20,000 years before early 
humans reached Europe. 
This means that the art was 
produced by Neanderthals 
— which means that they 
were far more intelligent 
than previously believed.
Recent discoveries of 
surprisingly sophisticated 
tools and ideas that were 
used by Neanderthals such 
as, medicinal plants, burial 
rites and stone tools - have 
already reframed precon-
ceived notions about Nean-
derthals’ mental capacity. 
However, the ability to make 
art is indicative of a new 
cognitive milestone - the 
ability to understand and 
have symbolic thought.
The art found in the 
Spanish caves comprise 
of some crudely outlined 
hands, series of lines, pig-
ment stained and pierced 
shells. The shells were found 
in Cueva de los Aviones — a 
cave located in south east-
ern Spain. The shells’ holes 
seemed to suggest that they 
were worn as body orna-
ments - which makes the 
Neanderthals capable of 
?rst, deciding to make art 
and then, mixing pigments 
and crafting shells. João Zil-
hão - a researcher at the Uni-
versity of Barcelona, who is 
an author of the paper, says 
that, ”The Aviones ?nds are 
the oldest such objects of 
personal ornamentation 
known to this day anywhere 
in the world.” He sees Nean-
derthals as the full mental 
equivalent of humans. While 
scientists remain divided 
on that claim, there is little 
doubt in attributing the art 
to Neanderthals.

Tesla and competitors race to dominate luxury car market
CALEB MILLER 
Publisher
For a company founded 
14 years ago and having only 
been making a true produc-
tion vehicle since 2012, 
Tesla is doing quite well. It 
has established its place in 
the market — appealing to 
a wealthy, forward thinking 
and somewhat environmen-
tally conscious demograph-
ic. But the established au-
tomakers, and particularly 
the German luxury giants, 
are not happy to see a new 
player joining their ranks. 
Over the past couple of 
years, companies like BMW, 
Mercedes, and Porsche have 
been announcing their in-
tentions to introduce a lux-
ury electric vehicle to battle 
the Tesla Model S or Model 
X, showing off ?ashy quasi-
SUV concepts with electric 
powertrains and allegedly 
impressive speci?cations. 
The dominant carmakers 
were caught a bit off guard 
by the success of Model S, 
which is now more than ?ve 
years old, and so their pro-
duction models aren’t due to 
hit the streets until next year. 
However, through concepts 
and leaked information, Tes-
la should have a pretty good 
idea of what type of compe-
tition to expect.
Most luxury companies 
initially stated plans for 
slinky four-door “coupes” 
like the Model S, but the 
relative success of the Model 
X SUV and the general mar-
ket trend towards crossovers 
have changed several auto-
makers’ minds. 
Audi’s e-tron Quattro and 
e-tron Sportback concepts 
preview an electric SUV ru-
mored to debut within the 
next year. If the concepts 
are any indication, the SUV 
will use three electric mo-
tors (one on the front axle, 
two on the rear) that would 
propel the Audi to 60 mph in 
the mid-four seconds with a 
battery range of more than 
300 miles. 
Jaguar is also prepping 
an SUV due next year, the 
I-Pace. The bodywork of the 
stunning concept is suppos-
edly quite close to the pro-
duction version, and with 
one electric motor at the 
front and one at the rear, the 
Jaguar matches the Audi’s 
acceleration ?gures.
BMW has taken a slightly 
different route. BMW has 
created a sub-brand, trendi-
ly dubbed “i,” and has al-
ready put two electric mod-
els into production, the i3 
and the i8. The i3, a quirky 
little hatchback, has had 
relative success globally, 
while the futuristic and gor-
geous i8 sports car has sold 
in small numbers. While the 
fate of these two models is 
undetermined, BMW has 
previewed a future “i” car, 
to be called the i5, with its 
i Vision Dynamics Concept. 
While this concept is a se-
dan, rumors also suggest a 
car called the iNext, which 
may be a codename for the 
i5 or a separate SUV model.
Mercedes is following in 
the footsteps of its Bavar-
ian competitor, announcing 
its “EQ” electric sub-brand 
with the Generation EQ 
Concept two years ago. This 
concept, which had a two 
electric motor setup and 
scalable battery parts for 
different amounts of power, 
hinted at a midsize SUV that 
is due out next year. The 
EQA Concept, on the other 
hand, will be a swanky little 
hatchback when it comes 
out in 2020. With the same 
setup as the SUV, it will get 
less power but still be able 
to do the 60 mph sprint in 5 
seconds and have a range of 
up to 400 miles.
Sports car connoisseur 
Porsche has even jumped 
on the bandwagon, with its 
achingly beautiful “Mission 
E” concept. Expected to ar-
rive next year, the Mission 
E promises to maintain the 
classic Porsche look while 
delivering over 600 horse-
power, 60 mph in less than 
3.5 seconds, and a range of 
approximately 500 miles. 
The Mission E is also ru-
mored to be a true perfor-
mance car, and might spawn 
an SUV variant not long af-
ter.
A recent entry is Polestar 
— formerly Volvo’s perfor-
mance arm, Polestar is now 
a separate electric sports car 
brand. Their ?rst vehicle, the 
“1,” will actually be a hybrid 
coupe based on the hand-
some Volvo Concept Coupe, 
and will begin production 
in mid-2019. With ?nan-
cial backing from Chinese 
car giant Geely and track-
car know-how from Lotus 
(which Geely also acquired), 
the Polestar brand looks to 
have a bright future.
While all of these auto-
makers rush to bring their 
electric cars to market, Tesla 
is continuing to expand. 
Along with the Model S and 
Model X, a smaller sedan 
called the Model 3 is ramp-
ing up production now, 
a new Roadster supercar 
is coming in 2020, and a 
semi-truck arrives sometime 
before that. 
There are also rumors of 
a pickup truck, a passenger 
van, and a small SUV in the 
pipeline. As Tesla steamrolls 
ahead, the established car-
makers are going to have to 
work even faster if they want 
to catch Tesla.

OLYMPICS, from A10
But curling also saw the 
most quintessential example 
of what Americans hope 
they can be and what the 
Games should be. The U.S. 
men’s curling team was led 
by John Shuster, the best 
curler America has to offer, 
who followed a bronze in 
the 2006 Torino Olympics 
with last and second-to-last 
?nishes in the two follow-
ing Olympics. The team bat-
tled back after a 2-4 start in 
round-robin play, captivated 
an American audience that 
fell in love with the games 
for two weeks, and won the 
most unlikely of golds.
In a time where the 
greatness of White’s 
snowboarding skill has 
seemingly exonerated him 
to the public, we saw the 
?ip side with women’s 
perseverance paying off. 
The U.S. Women’s Hockey 
team got their revenge 
on Canada, their biggest 
rivals, from the heartbreak 
silver from Sochi. Last year, 
the team announced they 
would boycott the world 
championships to protest 
equal pay. They took the risk, 
and won, striking a deal with 
USA Hockey, an important 
victory in the ?ght for equal 
pay for women.
The women’s hockey 
gold medal match itself 
was everything a fan could 
ask for (especially since 
NHL players, the best in 
the world, are not part of 
the men’s competition) – 
lead changes, momentum 
swings, and a heart-stopping 
shootout.
And so closes this 23rd 
Olympic cycle, as the 
athletes continue with their 
off-season competitions 
and training, and the world 
waits another four years 
to fall in love with sports 
they still don’t completely 
understand. But some 
moments will live with us 
forever, and that’s what the 
Olympics are all about.
Athletes experience highs and lows at Olympic Games

Women’s basketball win ?nal game of the season
BRAD PUSKAR
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
University men’s basketball 
team ended its season on a 
high note with a big 72–63 
win against their University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
rivals, the Case Western Re-
serve University Spartans. 
The Tartans ?nish the sea-
son going 7–18 and 3–11 in 
conference play. After the 
Spartans’ loss, they ?nished 
with a 12–13 record, going 
6–8 in conference.
The Tartans had three 
different players rack 
up double-?gure points, 
thanks to sophomore Zach 
Howarth with 18, junior 
Patrick Ehland with 12, and 
junior Seth Henry with 10 
points. Senior Ryan Maha 
drained three buckets from 
beyond the arc to rack up 
9 points, helping him end 
his career ranked fourth on 
the all-time-three-pointers 
made list with 183. Maha 
also had four rebounds in 
his ?nal game as a Tartan.
Carnegie Mellon built 
a sizeable lead in the ?rst 
half, 30–11, after three 
consecutive three pointers, 
two from Maha and one 
from Howarth. The Tar-
tans managed to control 
play through the remainder 
of the second half, at one 
point going up 40–19 with 
a minute left after a layup 
by Henry. The Spartans did 
manage to respond, how-
ever, on a jumper to make 
the score 40–21 at the half.
The Tartans held onto 
control of the game for 
the beginning of the sec-
ond half, building a lead 
of 58–43 up at the 11-min-
ute mark, but the Spartans 
bounced back and played 
some strong defense. The 
Spartans held the Tartans 
to just one ?eld goal for 
10:31 seconds, manag-
ing to shrink the Tartans’ 
lead to just four points, 
at 63–59. Howarth and 
the Tartans responded in 
kind, however, when he 
dropped in a layup with 
just 43 seconds remaining 
to cap off a run of seven 
straight points by the home 
team. The Tartans held 
onto that lead for the rest 
of the game, ?nishing off 
the Spartans with the ?nal 
score of 72–59.
The Tartans went 27 
for 67 against the Spar-
tans, with a 40.3 shooting 
percentage from the ?eld. 
They held the Spartans 
to 32.4 percent from ?eld 
goal range and controlled 
the ball well in the paint, 
scoring 34 points up close 
at the post. They also re-
corded more assists and 
less turnovers. The Spar-
tans maintained control 
of the boards, where they 
out-rebounded the Tartans 
54–40. The Tartans re-
ceived support from their 
bench players, who scored 
31 of Carnegie Mellon’s 72 
points in the victory. Nine 
different players recorded 
points in the game.
The Tartans end a lack-
luster season with a win 
and will look to bounce 
back next season. Good 
luck to the team and thanks 
to the seniors, Ryan Maha 
and Thomas Cook, for all 
they put into the Carnegie 
Mellon basketball team.

The Carnegie Mellon 
University women’s 
basketball team ?nished 
its 2017-18 season with a 
victory against University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
rivals Case Western Reserve 
University Spartans on 
Saturday, Feb. 24. After 
a close start, the Tartans 
pulled away in the second 
to win the game 71–55.
Sophomore Laurel 
Pereira led the Tartans with 
a game-high of 23 points, 
and 10 rebounds, recording 
the ?rst double-double 
of her career. Sophomore 
MaKayla Filiere had 13 
points, and sophomore 
Megan Jaeb added 10 
points, matching her 
career high. Junior Jenn 
Mayberger had team highs 
in assists and steals, with 
seven and four, respectively. 
First-year Kylie Huffman 
hauled in a team high of 11 
rebounds off the bench.
The Spartans struck ?rst 
with a layup in the opening 
minute of the ?rst quarter, 
but the Tartans quickly 
took the lead with a three-
pointer from Mayberger. 
Five other Tartans reached 
the basket as the teams 
traded shots and the lead 
for the rest of the quarter, 
which ended with the 
Tartans leading the game 
18–14.
The Tartans outscored 
the Spartans 23–11 in the 
second quarter with 50 
percent shooting and held 
the visitors to only 21.4 
percent shooting. Pereira 
took control of the Tartans’ 
defense with 16 points on 
5-for-6 shooting. Pereira 
opened the quarter with 
back-to-back jump shots 
and later scored seven 
straight points to build the 
Tartans’ lead, which was as 
much as 21 points a minute 
left to play. The Spartans 
responded with the ?nal 
?ve points of the quarter to 
close the half, trailing the 
Tartans 25–41.
Coming out of halftime, 
the Spartans scored ?ve 
points for a total 10 straight 
points continuing from 
the second quarter. Filiere 
ended the Spartans’ run 
with a three-pointer to 
make the score 44–30. 
With 2:22 left in the third, 
the Spartans cut the lead 
to 9 points, but the Tartans 
responded with another 
Filiere three-pointer to 
extend their lead back to 
double-digits. The Tartans 
maintained their lead in the 
fourth quarter, winning the 
game 71–55.
Overall, the Tartans shot 
46.4 percent from the ?eld, 
including 42.9 percent from 
the three-point line, the 
team’s third-highest team 
shooting percentage of 
the season. They bene?ted 
from more than four times 
as many bench points, 21 to 
the Spartans’ 5, as well as 
10 more points in the paint. 
The team also recorded 
more rebounds, assists, and 
second chance points.
The Tartans ?nish the 
2017-18 season with a 
10–15 record, 2–12 in UAA 
play, down from last sea-
son’s 21–7 (7–7 in UAA 
play) record. Will all 12 
players on the roster return-
ing, the Tartans will look to 
build on what they accom-
plished as they look to next 
season.

Olympics produce memorable moments in PyeongChang

Sports Editor
After 17 days of 
competition, the 2018 
Winter Olympics in 
Pyeongchang are complete. 
After 102 events in 15 
sports, the world has 
watched both dreams come 
true and expectations loom 
too large. But in the end, we 
have also watched the spirit 
of the Games prevail as well.
As always, politics 
threatened to take over the 
Olympics, from the fragile 
relations between North and 
South Korea to the Russian 
doping scandal running its 
course. But as always, the 
Games themselves were the 
best story, as they should be.
For the United States, 
there was some familiar 
territory at the top of the 
podium, but also a fair 
share of disappointment. 
Americans dominated the 
Phoenix Snow Park. Teens 
Red Gerard and Chloe 
Kim took gold, in men’s 
slopestyle and women’s 
halfpipe, respectively, 
becoming instant household 
names. Jamie Anderson 
defended her gold in 
women’s slopestyle, and 
picked up the silver in the 
Olympics’ inaugural big air 
competition. David Wise 
was the only other American 
to defend his gold medal 
from Sochi, in the men’s 
freestyle ski halfpipe.
With his gold in the men’s 
snowboarding halfpipe, 
his third overall, Shaun 
White ful?lled the come-
back story laid out perfectly 
for him by NBC after his 
fourth place ?nish in the 
2014 Sochi Olympics. He is 
undoubtedly the greatest 
snowboarder ever, but his 
legacy is now a murky one, 
with sexual harassment al-
legations and a settlement 
against him.
Ester Ledecká of the 
Czech Republic became 
the ?rst woman to win 
gold in two sports, the 
alpine skiing super-G and 
the snowboarding parallel 
giant slalom. Her win in 
the former was one of the 
best moments of the entire 
Olympics, as the shock on 
her face at the run of her 
life remained plastered on 
her face long after ours were 
moving on.
Norway exerted its 
Winter Games dominance, 
with a world-leading 39 
total medals, including 14 
gold, tied with Germany for 
the most. The Netherlands, 
clad in the country’s vibrant 
orange and blue, continued 
its speed skating supremacy 
with all their 20 medals 
in the sport, eight of them 
gold, while Hungary won its 
?rst ever Winter Games gold 
in the men’s 5000m speed 
skating gold.
Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan 
defended his men’s ?gure 
skating gold from Sochi, 
the ?rst man to do so since 
American Dick Button in 
1952. American Nathan 
Chen showed all his 18 years 
in his ?rst Olympics. Billed 
as a gold medal contender 
and one of the biggest 
challengers to Hanyu, he 
succumbed to nerves in his 
?rst two Olympic skates, the 
two worst of his short career. 
But he also showed the 
fearlessness of a teenager, 
coming back in his historic 
free skate, landing six 
quadruple jumps, ?ve of 
them cleanly.
The home country also 
boasted some of the greatest 
moments of the Games, 
with Yun Sung-bin taking 
gold in the skeleton, the 
?rst athlete outside North 
America or Europe to win an 
Olympic sliding medal. The 
Garlic Girls curling team, all 
of the surname Kim, swept 
their way to the silver medal 
and into the hearts of their 
people watching.

On spring break plans
Dear Izzy,
I love my friends, but we can’t plan things 
for s**t. Getting the eight of us to try to 
plan something together for spring break is 
impossible. Not only are all of us loaded with a 
ton of club meetings on top of the classes we’re 
already taking, but all of us have a bunch of 
different ideas of what we want to do for spring 
break. Three people want to go somewhere down 
South, like Miami, or some tropical island where 
the weather is hot and the people are hotter, and 
three people want to go somewhere with more 
of a city-like vibe and a lot of stuff to do and 
see. The other person is not even sure if she can 
actually go anymore or be there for the whole 
time and she wants to accommodate for that.
Now, I’m just worried because I am very well 
aware we should have probably booked hotels 
and plane tickets a long time ago. Is there 
anything we can do to pull together a last minute 
trip?
Sincerely,
Travel-Ready ImPossible
Dear T-R.I.P.,
It is obvious that the most important thing that you 
guys need to do is make the effort and time out 
of your busy schedules to sit down and go over 
everything you have so far.
When you first meet up with your friends, try to 
talk things out and make compromises for things 
you want in a destination that you will and will 
not be able to meet. When you’re together, try to 
meet up and look at some places online together 
to try to find a few cities or islands that make 
everyone happy.
But, while it is clear what everyone wants, when 
the eight of you meet up, you need to start 
clearing up what you can realistically do. Some 
places and tickets will be completely out of your 
price range, and that kind of takes over all of 
your wants for the perfect spring break trip. Make 
sure to take that into consideration too, otherwise 
you’d run the risk of just not having enough 
money — which no one wants.
But, you can also consider smaller things too.
Try taking a road trip with two cars across 
the country — it’ll make for a great bonding 
experience and even greater memories, and 
it’ll save you the hassle of finding plane tickets 
— there’s always a gas station somewhere. Go 
to someone’s hometown and just chill there, or 
take them to yours and show them the place that 
shaped you.
But, if it’s impossible to coordinate a trip for 
all eight of you, staying at home and relaxing 
from the schoolwork, research, extracurriculars, 
and planning is okay too. FaceTime hopefully 
shouldn’t be as hard to coordinate.
Best,
Izzy
Aisha Han | Contributing EditorBar Buddies: Industry Public House
There’s nothing better than a venue that serves 
both artisanal drinks and giant portions of food 
for a weekend night. Situated on Butler Street, 
Industry Public House has an expansive facade 
that you can’t miss. It’s almost entirely covered by 
windows, making it easy when window-shopping 
for places to chill and drink. When I found out 
the place is also known for its large selection of 
alcohol, I stopped by Industry Public House in 
Lawrenceville to see what all the fuss was about.
First of all, the space is huge, and the vibe was 
definitely happening. The dark decor gave a really 
cozy setting, and the crowd was an eclectic mix of 
young professionals, couples, families, and party 
groups.
It eventually got pretty packed, which is impressive 
given its huge space and many seating choices. 
The bar has a lot of room for movement and 
mingling, which makes it a hot commodity for 
visitors.
As the night wore on, it got more and more 
crowded. I wouldn’t have minded, but that’s 
when the service became lackluster as well. Be 
prepared to use your assertiveness when flagging 
down waiters or bartenders here. The situation 
wasn’t too terrible, though, because I spent my 
time waiting by chowing down on one of their 
flatbreads. It definitely has a better quality of bar 
food than the usual suspects, but with a better 
standard comes a prettier penny to spend.
I ordered the Rhuby Rhuby Rhuby cocktail, which 
is a mix of blackberries, lemon, basil, and rhubarb 
liqueur. It was a perfect mix of tart, sweet, and 
savory. If cocktails aren’t your thing, they have a 
great selection of craft beers, whiskey, and other 
spirits. Their drinks menu is exciting, with a lot of 
great contenders, and the bar is decked with 
bottles. I would probably choose the drinks over 
the food here, if given the choice.
One last comment is the pricing, which can get 
pretty steep depending on what you order. The 
food, though portioned generously, is a little 
expensive for the college student looking for a 
good time. I’d recommend taking advantage of 
their happy hour. From 4:30 - 6:30 p.m. Monday 
to Friday, you get $2 off all draft beers and a flat 
rate of $7 for all cocktails, as well as discounted 
flatbreads and burgers. That way, you can enjoy 
the space without worrying about emptying your 
wallet.
Definitely worth the trip, though.

Black Panther
Identity. Representation. Power. All just some of 
the key themes centered in the story of Marvel’s 
highly-anticipated 18th installment: Black 
Panther.
While being immersed in the excitement that’s 
been building around Black Panther for the past 
couple months, I frequently remembered one of 
my first experiences with representation when I 
was younger. As a little girl, one of my favorite 
movies was Rodgers and Hammerstein’s 
Cinderella. If you haven’t seen it, it’s a musical 
version of the classic Cinderella story told with a 
mixed cast: the king is played by a white actor, 
the queen is played by Whoopi Goldberg, the 
prince is played by a Filipino actor, and the 
titular Cinderella is played by Brandy, a 
black actress. 
I think I loved this movie so much 
mostly because of the catchy songs, 
but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve 
become more and more attached to 
it, because it was one of the 
first movies 
where I felt 
like I 
truly 
saw 
myself in the lead, like I could be that princess. It 
was my first taste of representation.
Maybe it’s not the best connection to Black 
Panther, being that Cinderella was a servant, 
forced into servitude by an evil stepmother. But 
maybe that’s one of the reasons why a movie 
like Black Panther is so important right now. 
There are no slaves, no gangsters, no drug 
addicts, none of the negative portrayals of 
African-Americans that are usually presented 
in films. Instead, Black Panther is a captivating 
story about a man’s journey to fulfill his destiny, 
never once believing that the color of his skin 
would hold him back. It was a superhero movie 
with a message.
Black Panther is set in the fictional East African 
nation of Wakanda, a technologically advanced 
civilization, powered by vibranium, hidden away 
from the rest of the world. A lot of the central 
conflict of the film has to do with Wakanda’s 
ability to utilize its resources to help the rest of 
the world. The nation of Wakanda was truly a 
character in itself. The portrayal of the nation 
included dense forests, rustic reds, greens, 
and browns — what you would expect from an 
African nation, interwoven with high powered 
trains, towering buildings, gorgeous waterfalls, 
and mountains. It was a place that seemed both 
foreign yet familiar. Adding to the beauty of 
Wakanda are the gorgeous costumes, makeup, 
and hair designs incorporated into the film, 
created by Ruth E. Carter, Joel Harlow, and 
Camille Friend, respectively, all inspired by 
the history of African tribes.
The women in the movie epitomize 
black female power. The nation’s 
armed forces are called the Dora 
Milaje, female warriors sworn to 
protect Wakanda and its king, 
T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), 
aka the Black Panther, who 
we are first introduced to in 
Captain America: Civil War. 
The Dora Milaje is led by Okoye 
(Danai Gurira) and are adorned in 
matching red–toned armor, shaved 
heads, and a fierce demeanor. One of my favor-
ite scenes is when Okoye, while undercover, 
complains about her discomfort with wear-
ing a straight-haired wig, a quick play on her 
acceptance of her own feminine beauty. Once 
a fight breaks out, the wig is one the first things 
she tosses away. In an interview with People 
Magazine, Gurira called the moment subversive, 
and a refusal of conventional norms of feminine 
beauty, saying “[Okoye] is just being who she 
is. You know, being proud of her bald head 
and her tats. And how her femininity — all of the 
women [in the film] — their femininity coincides 
so seamlessly with their ferocity. And how those 
two things do not have to compromise them-
selves for the other thing.”
Other women in the film include Nakia (Lupita 
Nyong’o), T’Challa’s somewhat love interest, a 
warrior in her own right, who is a strong believer 
in doing good in the world and helping those 
not able to help themselves. Letitia Wright shines 
as T’Challa’s little sister, Shuri. Although 16, she 
is the brains behind the creation and mainte-
nance of the technology of Wakanda.
While Marvel villains are usually pretty one-
dimensional and unmemorable, with the 
exception of Loki of course, Erik “Killmonger” 
Stephens (Michael B. Jordan) carries a complex-
ity that makes the title of villain somehow seem 
wrong. While I don’t agree with his motivation 
to seek vengeance on T’Challa, it’s easy to 
understand where those motivations hailed from, 
and how this was created as a product of his 
childhood. Killmonger often cites his experiences 
growing up as a black man in America, being 
linked to a history of slavery and oppression, as 
the motivation behind a lot of his actions. “Y’all 
sitting up here comfortable. Must feel good. 
Meanwhile, there are about two billion people 
all over the world that look like us. But their 
lives are a lot harder. Wakanda has the tools to 
liberate them all,” says Killmonger at one point 
in the movie. There were moments when I found 
myself more interested in Killmonger’s story over 
T’Challa’s, but I praise Marvel for finally creat-
ing an antagonist that feels like an equal con-
tender to the movie’s protagonist.
Black Panther includes a truly melanin 
infused cast, essentially a who’s-who of black 
Hollywood, including familiar faces such as 
Daniel Kaluuya, known for his Oscar-nominated 
performance in Get Out, as W’Kabi, Angela 
Bassett as T’Challa’s mother Ramonda, Forest 
Whitaker as Zuri, the spiritual guide, Sterling K. 
Brown as N’Jobu, Winston Duke as M’Baku, and 
Florence Kasumba as Ayo, among others. The 
film also includes Martin Freeman returning as 
Agent Everett Ross, and Andy Serkis who gives a 
stunning portrayal of the crazed Ulysses Klaue.
Black Panther has something for everybody: a 
captivating story, fully-fleshed out characters, a 
classic comic book superhero adaptation, 
and amazing music by Kendrick Lamar. 
Overall, the hype behind Black Panther 
is absolutely deserved, and worth every 
praise and box office smashing record it 
has received thus far.

I love Marvel, but I am very clearly not 
African-American. While I am proudly Asian-
American, my New England experiences have 
also made me very basic and white. In fact, I 
might be one of the least qualified people to 
tell you how important Black Panther is. But, 
I can’t emphasize how instrumental this film is 
for not just the future of Hollywood, but for an 
entire generation.
It is impossible to count the number of records 
this movie has broken on two hands. Black 
Panther is currently the highest-rated superhero 
movie on Rotten Tomatoes with 97 percent, 
tied with The Incredibles. It had the most ticket 
presales out of all superhero films, including 
those from Marvel Studios. It has the Marvel 
Cinematic Universe’s (MCU) highest-grossing 
first week at the box office. It had the biggest 
opening weekend at the box office for an 
African-American director, Ryan Coogler. It 
set a record for the highest box office opening 
weekend in February, beating Deadpool by 
$60 million. Oh and by the way, that opening 
weekend made $202 million.
Black Panther, a movie almost entirely featuring 
African-American actors, directors, writers, and 
overall crew members, now has the fifth-highest 
domestic opening weekend of all time, wedged 
in between two of the MCU’s biggest movies, 
The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron.
Hollywood calls Black Panther and its finan-
cial performance a watershed moment. Black 
Panther is not just a magnificent, long-overdue 
film that praises its cultural origins. It’s become 
a beautiful gemstone in the history and culture 
of African-Americans, and maybe of their chil-
dren’s history and culture, and perhaps a light-
ning rod of inspiration for those who seek it. It 
educates others about African culture and helps 
to open people’s perspectives about the world 
around them. It is visually stunning and proba-
bly Marvel’s smartest movie, with every choice 
made — certain shots, certain costumes and 
motifs, certain colors — meaning something. It 
is thought-provoking and examines a culture’s 
past to prepare for their future through its 
larger, overall messages. It is masterfully acted, 
featuring fantastic performances from all of its 
actors — especially that of Michael B. Jordan, 
whose portrayal of Killmonger usurps the title 
of the MCU’s best villain from Tom Hiddleston’s 
Loki for a key reason: Loki, universally loved, 
is a classic comic book villain. But Killmonger, 
also universally loved, starts discussions.
Everything surrounding Black Panther was more 
than just hype for another Marvel movie. It 
was the slow build-up to a cultural reckoning; 
from its casting news and announcements to its 
trailers to the moments before and after walk-
ing to the theater and seeing the celebration of 
African and African-American culture reflected 
in the clothes of the people Black Panther seeks 
to represent, this movie had much higher stakes 
and maybe even sky-high expectations to meet 
due to its material and proposed vision.
And thankfully, it did. In fact, not only did 
Black Panther meet those sky-high expectations, 
it almost fundamentally changed our cultural 
landscape. Black Panther caused tremors 
throughout a culture and through a grander 
political scheme. It’s finally proven how and 
why representation matters in Hollywood and 
what this can do for a person. In a time of 
political turmoil and loss of hope, Black Panther 
brings that hope back to its community and 
worldwide, and maybe serves as an inspiration 
to that young African-American boy who wants 
to break into the entertainment industry or that 
African-American teenage girl wanting to break 
into the STEM fields. However, since this is also 
a time of said political turmoil, it’s also brought 
out the worst in people.
In the first few days of Black Panther’s release, 
some Twitter accounts tried to spread false 
stories of attacks at screenings, saying that 
African-American attackers called people out 
saying “This movie ain’t for you, whitey” or 
“You’re in the wrong theater.” To make matters 
worse, pictures of “victims” from these Twitter 
accounts ranged from pictures of domestic 
abuse victims to pictures of people who were 
attacked up to five years ago. 
To combat the racism and bigotry, a little while 
after, some Twitter users pushed back and 
mocked the attackers with tweets such as “last 
night I was attending Black Panther when a 
black child who looked to be around four years 
old told me ‘this movie wasn’t for me’ and pro-
ceeded to violently assault me with an eighteen 
megaton atomic bomb,” accompanied by a 
picture of an atomic bomb, and other stories of 
“attacks” combined with images of beaten up 
people from pop culture. The overwhelmingly 
positive response Black Panther has generated 
from people shows that overall, the movie aims 
to be a force for good and a catalyst to shape 
the future. And perhaps most importantly, peo-
ple are supporting that change and working 
harder to make it happen.
In an op-ed piece with CNN, host of The 
Dean Obeidallah Show, Dean Obeidallah, 
stated how Black Panther’s success “gives me 
hope that one day my minority group, Arab 
Americans and Muslims, will see a super-
hero from our community on the big screen.” 
Throughout most of our lives, African-Americans 
and members of other minority groups like 
myself have seen people who don’t look like us 
as people needing to be saved, or as villains, 
or simply not on the screen at all. But Black 
Panther changes all of that drastically. 
From a financial and business standpoint, Black 
Panther proves that African-Americans on the 
screen are bankable and can generate profit, 
and that consumers are yearning for more 
diverse properties where they can see them-
selves on TV or in a packed theater. From a 
cultural standpoint, Black Panther is the newest 
addition to a prestigious and widely celebrated 
list of movies like Star Wars and fellow MCU 
entries The Avengers and Raiders of the Lost 
Ark, celebrated for their impact on history, on 
people, and on a generation. And for African-
Americans, Black Panther is an overwhelmingly 
positive reminder that you truly can do any-
thing you set your mind to, because someone 
who looks just like you might just be doing the 
exact same thing.
Black Panther as a Cultural Movement
article and layout by Izzy Sio | Pillbox Editor

---------------------------------------------------

     very year, Carnegie Mellon is lucky to 
     have passionate students work 
together to organize events that 
celebrate diversity on campus. They 
help create comfortable and safe 
environments for students to share 
their various differences with others in 
the university. One of the most recent 
of these events that occurred was 
the Spark the Movement showcase, 
which took place in the Cohon Center 
Rangos Ballroom last Friday. The 
showcase, which has now become an 
annual university event, started just last 
year as a project by former fifth year 
scholar, Rachel Freer. I was fortunate 
to have been able to attend last year’s 
showcase, and I was excited to see how 
similar and different this year’s event 
would be.
The live performance part of the 
showcase was divided into two parts. 
The show opened with a powerful 
performance of Nina Simone’s “I Wish 
I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free,” 
by electrical and computer engineering 
major and senior, Arnelle Etienne and 
Ziv Piper accompanying her on the 
piano. The performance easily moved 
the entire audience, and it set a very 
empowering and reflective tone for the 
rest of the event. The acts that took 
place afterwards all had a similar impact 
on the audience, with each and every 
performance being very genuine and 
representative of the student performers’ 
experiences. Junior Art major, Emily 
Giedzinski’s personal choreography to 
the song “Ugly” by Nicole Dollanganger, 
was a powerful example of the honesty 
that the performers put into their acts, 
as her dance was a personal reflection 
of an experience of bullying. Stories 
of other various social and internal 
hardships were told through spoken 
word poems and songs, as well as 
paintings and photographs throughout 
the event. The second part of the Spark 
the Movement showcase took place 
immediately after the live performance 
portion, at a reception sponsored by the 
Center for Student 
Diversity and Inclusion. All the 
performers and audience 
members were able to celebrate the 
event together and view visual art pieces 
that share similar messages to those 
from the live performances.
What’s so amazing about this showcase 
is how strong of a connection you can 
feel with all the artists. They shared 
personal feelings and stories on topics 
and issues that many in the audience, 
including myself, could easily relate to. 
Last year, as a freshman first seeing the 
showcase, I didn’t truly understand the 
importance of this event. Now I can say 
that I’ve truly realized how significant 
it is to talk about our feelings on both 
social and personal issues with others 
in the campus community. Sparking 
such conversations can help lead to 
creating more safe spaces for people 
to fearlessly be themselves and connect 
with others who can also understand 
their experiences.

“Tyler, the Creator has emerged as an unlikely 
voice for honesty and compassion with his latest 
work, and his show at Stage AE fully reflected 
that commitment.”
TYLER,
THE CREATOR
6
TYLER,
THE CREATORVINCE
STAPLESX VINCE
STAPLES

---------------------------------------------------

The music of rappers Tyler, the Creator and Vince Staples 
is seemingly diametrically opposed. Tyler, on his lat-
est album Flower Boy, adopted a floral theme rife with 
garden imagery and immaculate live-instrumentation 
arrangements. Staples, on the other hand, worked with 
rising electronic producers on Big Fish Theory to craft 
an industrial, almost Orwellian work. Big Fish Theory 
is abrasive and wordy, while Flower Boy is inviting and 
catchy. This is not to say that Tyler failed lyrically on his 
album, but rather that his typically baritone flow man-
aged to put together an album as well-known for its 
hooks as its verses. Both projects are successes in 
their own rights, but this is perhaps the only 
unifying factor that brought Tyler and 
Vince together on their ongoing joint 
tour.
The show last week, with Vince 
opening and Tyler headlining, 
drew a packed house at Stage 
AE. The majority of the crowd, it 
seemed, came to see Tyler, and that 
was most apparent during Vince’s 
set. The crowd bobbed along to his 
electronic-inspired bangers, but for the 
most part seemed disinterested in his 
music. This was especially upsetting 
given Vince’s level of notoriety in hip 
hop and the quality of his music. The 
set, too, was great, as the stage and 
Vince’s presence felt like something drawn 
straight from 1984. Digital cubes were able 
to display video twisted and turned to the 
beat of each song, giving the stage a surreal 
look meant to unsettle the audience. Hits like 
“Big Fish” and “Norf Norf” drew excitement 
from the crowd as Vince’s most well known 
songs, but there were noticeable dips in 
energy when lesser-known songs like “Party 
People” came on. Much of Vince’s new music 
is crafted to be danced to, as it creates an 
almost club-like atmosphere. It became more 
explicitly clear once Tyler took the stage, the crowd was 
evidently more interested in moshing than dancing.
There was a lull of almost 40 minutes between Vince’s 
and Tyler’s set, and the crowd grew noticeably more 
restless as time went on. Then the clock struck 10:00 
p.m., and Tyler’s entrance began. Vince’s wall of digital 
cubes had been disassembled to reveal a purple curtain, 
and the curtain eventually dropped to reveal Tyler stand-
ing atop a log resting on its side at an incline. He was 
well above the audience, facing away from the crowd as 
Flower Boy hit “Where This Flower Blooms” faded in. He 
turned to face the crowd only once his vocal part began, 
and immediately grabbed the energy of the crowd. He 
held it for the entirety of his set. The set itself was fairly 
substantial in length, as well. He played almost the entire-
ty of Flower Boy in addition to songs off earlier albums 
like Goblin and Wolf. Bangers like “Who Dat Boy” and 
“I Ain’t Got Time” sent the crowd into a frenzy. I was hit 
in the face at least three times, at one point so hard that 
my glasses flew off and went missing for half of a song. 
Luckily, a good samaritan helped me find them, and 
I was able to quickly fix them before the next 
track.
Aside from former Odd Future collaborators Taco 
— who opened the show with a DJ set before Vince 
came on — and Jasper, who sat off to the side, Tyler 
was the only person on stage, and he commanded it 
with ease. For someone sharing such personal details in 
songs like “Garden Shed” and “Glitter,” both of which 
he performed, Tyler showed uniform confidence in the 
words he rapped and sang. For an artist like him, who 
went from spouting homophobia in his early works to qui-
etly coming out of the closet on Flower Boy, Tyler carried 
the same genuine energy on stage that sold me on the 
album. The show felt personal, cathartic — especially for 
Tyler as he screamed “I’ve been kissing white boys since 
2004” — and celebratory. Tyler, the Creator has emerged 
as an unlikely voice for honesty and compassion with his 
latest work, and his show at Stage AE fully reflected that 
commitment.

CMU ALLIES is hosting their third Open Mic 
Night event, taking place Friday, March 2, as 
part of their observance of Zero Discrimination 
Day. Zero Discrimination Day, an annual holi-
day celebrated by the United Nations (U.N.) 
and other international organizations, focuses 
on challenging discrimination by celebrating 
“diversity, tolerance, and inclusion,” a goal 
which ALLIES aims to fulfill with their “Shine a 
Light” Open Mic Night.
ALLIES is Carnegie Mellon’s primary student 
activist organization, with a strong focus on the 
diverse undergraduate LGBTQ+ community. 
In addition to offering materials and hosting 
events in support of LGBTQ+ students, they also 
aim to create a more inclusive and educated 
community at Carnegie Mellon. Frequently 
tabling on campus and coordinating social 
activities, ALLIES creates spaces for their stu-
dents to become more connected and more 
informed. A few of their main initiatives include 
running support groups for various demograph-
ics and intersections within the LGBTQ+ com-
munity, like the Queer Women Support Group 
and the Trans and Non-binary Support Group, 
as well as recognition of formal holidays, 
like the Trans Day of Visibility, National 
Coming Out Day, and GAYpril.
                                                  
“Shine a Light” will celebrate inclusion by plac-
ing marginalized groups at the forefront; it aims 
to place a spotlight on the challenges those 
groups face, as well as highlight the wonder-
ful diversity that exists within them. Members 
of those groups will have the opportunity to 
perform a piece that shares their experiences, 
helping to create an atmosphere of understand-
ing across the many communities and cultures 
within Carnegie Mellon, and even Pittsburgh as 
a whole. In the true spirit of inclusion, ALLIES 
encourages everyone and anyone to perform, 
“regardless of identity or affiliation.” While 
pieces relating to the LGBTQ+ community are 
welcome, “Shine a Light” will feature a variety 
of pieces relating to a variety of topics, so they 
do not have to solely relate to LGBTQ+ issues. 
However, there are a few requirements:
ALLIES also encourages everyone to stop on by 
and listen to the performances, even if you do 
not perform. Some notable performances from 
past years have included songs from Carnegie 
Mellon’s Christian a capella group Joyful 
Noise, as well as spoken word on the struggles 
of growing up queer in a homophobic society. 
“Shine a Light” will take place Friday, March 
2, 7:30 p.m.  - 9:30 p.m. in the Connan Room.
If any individuals are interested in performing 
for the event or have any further questions, 
please send an email to allies.open.mic@gmail.
com. If you’d like to gain more information 
about ALLIES, feel free to stop by their weekly 
general body meetings, which are every 
Wednesday at 5 p.m. in the Cohon Center 
Room 335 (SoHo).

ALLIES ‘Shine a Light’ on 
Campus Diversity
“Our main requirements are that the pieces 
must relate to some aspect of identity (gen-
der, ethnicity, religion, etc.) as well as the 
event theme of ‘Shine a Light,’” said ALLIES. 
“We encourage performers to illuminate the 
different aspects of their identity through var-
ious media like spoken word, slam poetry, a 
cappella, playing instruments, and so on.”
