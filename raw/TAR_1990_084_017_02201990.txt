Someone walked into the Stu­
dent Affairs Office on December 7 
and asked for an emergency stu­
dent loan in the amount of $150. 
He got it.
On January 18, he returned to 
Student Affairs and asked for 
another emergency loan — this 
time in the amount of $100. And 
he got that, too.
Unusual? No — not unless the 
recipient of the loans obtained 
them by using a Carnegie Mellon 
ID which was not his own, like 
this man did.
The incidents came to light 
when the student whose social 
security number had been used 
came to Student Affairs and 
complained to Ruth Gallo, a sec­
retary, about unauthorized 
charges on his account.
Records from the Carnegie
Mellon ID. Center obtained by 
Investigator William Kaiser of 
Carnegie Mellon Campus Police 
indicate that a “replacement” ID 
card with the social security 
number of the victim was issued 
to the offender on December 7.
However, no photo of the of­
fender could be obtained because 
no duplicate photos or negatives 
are retained by the ID Center for 
the University’s records.

Chatham students fight against coed proposal
By JOSH RUBEN
Tartan Contributing Editor
The Chatham College Board of Trustees 
is considering a proposal to make the 121- 
year old women’s school a co-educational 
institution, according to an announcement 
made last Tuesday by college President 
Rebecca Stafford.
The announcement sparked protests 
from outraged students who feel the ad­
ministration is turning its back on them.
The fear the students have about the 
school going co-ed is that the school will 
lose its sense of intimacy and unity, even 
though men already cross-register at 
Chatham. More importantly, the students 
fear that men will come to dominate all 
facets of the college community.
Student Government President Mellis- 
sia Diggs pointed out that the protests and 
general student reaction should not be 
considered an indication that Chatham 
students hate or resent men. She explains
why the students want to keep the school 
a single-sex institution. “We live in a male- 
dominated society. As women, we need to 
separate ourselves so that we can learn 
who we are.”
The general student opinion on the 
proposal is that the trustees simply want 
to boost enrollment and make more money 
for the school. “It’s all about business,” 
said junior Chris Grande.
“We feel we’re being betrayed,” says 
sophomore Dawn Kulick.
According to Jane Beckwith, Chatham’s 
executive director of public affairs, the 
decision to admit men is not a question of 
economics. “We have no debt and over a 
$40 million endowment,” she says.
Both Beckwith and Stafford cite demo­
graphics as the reason the decision to admit 
men is being considered. According to 
Beckwith, a recent poll from the Women’s 
College Coalition showed that 11 percent 
of women graduating from high school con-

Waning grants may shrink faculty
By FARRON W. LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Universities are businesses, and 
as a result, Carnegie Mellon may 
be seeing some faculty cuts in the 
very near future, according to 
Carnegie Mellon President Rich­
ard Cyert.
“Research is sponsored, by and 
large, by grants from the federal 
government,” says Cyert, “and if 
the federal government cuts back 
research grants, as people are 
expecting, there would be a lack 
of money for research—and there 
would be some shrinkage of size 
of the university.”
While cuts in Carnegie Mellon*? 
grants are not imminent, the

“The cuts are for sure,” says

Robert Sekerka. “We’ve seen defi­

Foundation, and flat grants have 
been given instead of grants that 
are adjusted for inflation.”

of this trend.

Vanishing jackets baffle 
partygoers, fraternities
By RACHEL GARB
Tartan Staffwriter
On the night of Saturday, 
January 20, senior JanineBodio 
left her leather jacket in the 
back of a closet at Pi Kappa 
Alpha fraternity during a party. 
“I figured it was safe since I 
have friends in the house,” she 
said, “so I went around to other 
parties. I didn’t go back to Pika 
until the next day, and it was 
gone. I had planned to call Se­
curity on Monday, but they 
called me first and let me know 
that they had my jacket.”
A student from Chatham,
mistaking the jacket to be her 
own, took it home with her that 
evening from Sigma Nu. She 
had not been at Pika at all that 
night. When she realized the 
jacket wasn’t hers, she notified 
Carnegie Mellon Campus Se­
curity. “I’m very lucky to have 
my jacket back,” says Bodio. 
“But the big question is, how 
did it get from Pika to Sigma 
Nu?”
Several other incidents of 
jackets disappearing from fra­
ternity parties have occurred in 
the past month. On January 18,

MIT selection 
fails to faze 
CMU search
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan News Editor
Last week’s announcement by the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology that it has reached the 
conclusion of its presidential search will not have a 
significant effect on Carnegie Mellon’s search, offi­
cials here said.
John Fetkovich, chair of Carnegie Mellon’s Fac­
ulty Presidential Search Committee, said he is not 
sure what impact, if any, MIT’s announcement will 
have on Carnegie Mellon’s year-old search.
In a letter dated last Thursday, Henry D. Jacoby, 
chair of the faculty at MIT, announced officially that 
the presidential search committees there had de­
cided to nominate Phillip A. Sharp, a professor of 
biology and director of the MIT Center for Cancer 
Research, to be the next MIT president. The Corpo­
ration — MIT’s equivalent to Carnegie Mellon’s 
Board of Trustees — will vote on a formal offer to 
Sharp at its March 2 meeting.
According to The Tech, MIT’s student newspaper, 
the announcement came earlier than expected after 
rumors of Sharp’s nomination began to spread around 
the Cambridge campus. Professor Robert Solow, 
chair of the faculty committee involved in MIT’s 
search, told The Tech that he* thought making the 
announcement before the March meeting of the 
Corporation was inevitable.
Solow also told The Tech that he thought it was 
important to select a president who is respected by 
the faculty. Earlier in the search, MIT faculty 
members and students expressed concern over the 
candidacy of MIT Provost John Deutch, who they 
claimed was too closely tied to industry and the 
military to serve as MIT’s president.
Deutch’s leadership at MIT wasn’t without contro­
versy — according to The Thistle, a newspaper 
published by MIT’s Alternative News Collective,

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Researchers find flaws in 
federal pollution control
Carnegie Mellon researchers have found flaws in the federal 
government’s approach to dealing with urban ozone pollution.
“Our $30 billion annual price tag for controlling urban air 
quality can be cut substantially by attacking the problem with 
supercomputers,” says Gregory McRae, associate professor of 
Chemical Engineering and Engineering and Public Policy.
McRae is part of a research team working at CMU to under­
stand the processes responsible for the formation of air pollution. 
Team members found that the government’s approach to de­
creasing ozone levels was focusing only on reducing hydrocar­
bons without reducing nitrogen oxides.
To reduce air pollution, researchers found that it wasn’t enough 
to decrease hydrocarbon emissions; to reduce ozone and the par­
ticulates that cause decreased visibility, nitrogen oxide emis­
sions must be controlled as well.
Their findings have been incorporated into new clean air 
legislation and have also been used to formulate President 
Bush’s proposed new federal clean air standards.
Biology Department wins grant 
for undergraduate research
Carnegie Mellon’s Biological Sciences Department has re­
ceived one of 51 national $1.2 million grants from the Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute to strengthen its programs in under­
graduate education.
The goal is to help increase the number of students, particu­
larly women and minorities, who pursue research and teaching 
careers in the fields of medical and biological sciences.
Susan Henry, head of the Biological Sciences Department, says 
a combination of existing programs and innovative new ones 
being planned enabled the University to clinch the grant.
The department also plans to put more students into laborato­
ries in their college careers, giving them more involvement in real 
research science. Students will be given summer job opportuni­
ties in labs and will be supported by a grant-funded stipend.
“We want to design innovative programs to attract and retain 
a greater number of students,” says Henry.
Discussions dealing with life 
choices preface career fair
In preparation for March 21’s Toward Tomorrow's World ca­
reer fair, two discussions will be held on Wednesday in different 
locations on campus.
“Do What You Love; Love What You Do” will be held at 12:30 
in Hamburg Hall 1000. This presentation looks at the necessity 
for people to pursue their dreams and goals in order to be 
successful and productive. Speakers are Maureen Trotto-Lagen- 
walter, a 1971 Carnegie Mellon drama graduate; and Joseph 
Rhodes, Jr., a member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Com­
mission.
“Science, Technology, and the Shape of Society,” will be held at 
4:30 pm in Doherty Hall 1112. It will examine the contributions 
that scientists and engineers can make to society. Dr. Granger 
Morgan of Carnegie Mellon’s Engineering and Public Policy De­
partment will moderate the discussion.
Panelists include Dr. Thomas Moss of Case Western Reserve 
University, Dr. Jana Milford, of the University of Connecticut; 
and Dr. Eric Arnett of the American Association for the Advance­
ment of Science.

WWII powers 
plan German 
reunification
OTTAWA (AP) — The United 
States, the Soviet Union, and four 
other countries agreed last Tues­
day to a two-stage formula de­
signed to reunite East Germany 
and West Germany, according to 
a statement obtained by the As­
sociated Press.
In the first stage, East Ger­
many and West Germany would 
meet on legal, economic and po­
litical issues, according to the 
statement. These talks would 
begin soon after East Germany 
holds national elections.
In the second stage, the foreign 
ministers of the two Germanys 
would meet with several foreign 
ministers to discuss external is­
sues of reunification, including 
the security of surrounding states.
The statement added that 
“preliminary discussions at the
official level will begin shortly.” 
Although the statement was not 
specific, among the “external 
aspects” to be considered by the 
Big Four allies of World War II 
will be whether the new Germany 
is a member of the main Western 
military alliance, NATO. The 
United States wants a united 
Germany to remain in the NATO 
alliance, while the Soviet Union 
wants a neutral Germany. East 
Germany now is a member of the 
‘ Warsaw Pact.
U.S. officials bill the plan as 
“Two plus Four,” a reference to 
the four World War II allies and 
the two Germanys.
Mandela echoes 
calls of ANC for 
voting rights
SOWETO, South Africa (AP)— 
The African National Congress 
insists on full black voting rights, 
but it is open to compromise on 
other constitutional issues and to
considering guarantees for 
whites, Nelson Mandela said.
“I think it would be most pre­
sumptuous of me to speak for the 
ANC,” he said. “It is the ANC who 
would decide what compromises 
it should make. We are ready for 
honorable compromises without 
surrendering our principles.”
During a conversation with a 
small group of reporters, Man­
dela was asked whether the ANC 
was willing to negotiate about its 
demand for a one-person, one- 
vote system, which would lead to 
black majority rule.
“That is the nature of compro­
mising — you compromise on 
fundamental issues,” he said, but 
did not give the impression the 
ANC was prepared to alter its 
position on voting.
Agreements close 
drug summit
CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) 
—President Bush signed a series 
of drug-fighting agreements with
the leaders of Colombia, Peru and 
Bolivia on Thursday at a s< 
rity-shielded summit.
Bush promised to seek ex­
panded U.S. markets for Colom­
bian products, part of an effort t< 
coax Andean producers out of the 
coca business and into growing 
other crops.
Colombia has complained that 
U.S. trade policy is hurting its 
major legal exports, including 
coffee, cut flowers and sugar.
Among other steps taken at the 
summit meeting, held at a tightly 
guarded naval base off this Car­
ibbean resort city:
•An agreement with Bolivia to 
help stem the movement of U.Si 
firearms into South American 
nations.
•An agreement with Peru that 
places a priority on extradition of 
fugitives to stand trial in the 
country where they are accused.
•Agreements with Bolivia 
Peru that will allow the exchange 
of financial documents to combat 
money-laundering schemes.

Experts say U.S. 
lacking in birth 
control research
WASHINGTON (DJ) — The 
U.S. has fallen behind other coun­
tries in developing contraceptives, 
depriving Americans of birth 
control choices available else­
where, a study by the Institute of 
Medicine reports.
All but one of the major phar­
maceutical companies in the U.S. 
have stopped significant contra­
ceptive research, and new birth
control techniques used overseas 
haven’t been cleared for the U.S. 
market. The study blames the 
cost, time and difficulty of win­
ning regulatory approval from the 
FDA and fears of product liabil­
ity suits for limiting contracep­
tive choices in the U.S.
In the report, the congression- 
ally-chartered research institute 
recommends several regulatory 
changes to speed the development 
and introduction of new contra­
ceptive measures in the U.S. It 
urges the FDA to pay more atten­
tion to benefits of new birth con­
trol techniques, along with the 
agency’s primary focus on safety. 
It also urges a federal product 
liability law that would make it 
easier for manufacturers to use 
FDA approval as a defense 
against suits.
There are a number of promis­
ing contraceptive developments 
on the horizon, some of which are 
already in use outside the U.S. 
But without new spending on re­
search and a different regulatory 
climate, Americans will continue 
to depend on 20-year-old birth 
control technology, said Luigi 
Mastroianni Jr., the committee’s 
chair.
A wider range of contraceptive 
choices could reduce the numbei 
of abortions and unwanted preg­
nancies in the U.S., says the study, 
which was financed by the An­
drew W. Mellon Foundation. 
About half of the approximately
1.5 million abortions performed 
in the U.S. each year are in re­
sponse to contraceptive failure, 
the study says. “The stronger the 
desire to reduce abortion, the 
greater should be the investment 
to develop new methods of con 
traception,” the committee said.
To reduce the threat of liability, 
the panel recommended that Con 
gress pass a uniform product lia 
bility law that would reduce the 
cost and uncertainty of having tj 
operate under 50 state statutes.'

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 20 February 19903
An as-yet unidentified West German 
firm has donated $15 million to Carnegie 
Mellon to establish an Institute for In­
ternational Management at Carnegie 
Mellon.
According to Carnegie Mellon Presi­
dent Richard Cyert, who will serve as the 
institute’s first director, the details of 
the gift are still being worked out. Cyert 
said the Institute should open in July.
GSIA Dean Elizabeth Bailey said that 
the the University will begin to plan the 
scope of the institute in April, with rep­
resentatives from the company. Accord­
ing to Bailey, “right now it is not known 
what part of the Institute will involve 
faculty, researchers, staff, or students— 
that remains to be worked out.”
Bailey believes Carnegie Mellon will 
be the first school to undertake some­
thing of the magnitude of the institute.
“It is important for Carnegie Mellon to 
link with other countries — the world of 
the future involves the entire globe,” 
said Bailey.
“The best colleges in the country are 
plugged into the problems of the world,” 
she explained, and international man­
agement is currently a problem for many 
firms worldwide.
Bailey believes that by establishing an 
Institute for International Management, 
new frameworks for international man­
agement can be more rapidly dissemi­
nated throughout the world.
Cyert said that at first the institute 
will “focus on the firm.” Some issues that 
he plans to address are the distribution 
in international firms and the quality, 
establishment, and maintenance of in­
ternational firms.
Bailey said that the Institute will also 
concentrate on industry and the envi­
ronment and on the assimilation of 
Eastern Europe in the world economy.
Initial support for the institute comes 
from Europe, but GSIA administrators 
hope that Asian support will be received 
as well.
In addition to attracting German schol-' 
ars to Carnegie Mellon, the Institute has 
also drawn scholars from other coun­
tries.
Cyert said that the firm has committed 
to giving the money but is still working 
out the financing. Cyert said that it plans 
to contribute $1 million a year for the 
first few years.
While the Institute is being funded by 
one firm, it is hoped that other firms will 
participate in the institute’s programs 
by funding specific projects.

Fixin’ up: Group strives to improve classrooms
eA8RAEDCko4EAiyoNo
By RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
“The tragedy of the 
commons”—that’s how 
Edwin Fenton, director 
of the University Teach­
ing Center, refers to the 
current situation in 
colleges and universi­
ties throughout the country. And he says 
that Carnegie Mellon is no exception: 
While office space, research labs, and 
other departmental areas and facilities 
were grabbing center stage, classrooms 
were moved into the wings.
Compounding the problems at Carne­
gie Mellon was what Fenton dubbed “the 
Research Pac Man,” which he says was 
given new vigor under the Cyert admini­
stration. Competition for researching 
teachers and their attendant grant 
money absorbed more and more space— 
often at the expense of classrooms.
But six years ago things began to 
change. In typical Carnegie Mellon fash­
ion, a committee was appointed to study 
the problem. In 1984, then-Vice Presi­
dent John P. Crecine assembled a group 
of 13 winners of the University’s Ryan 
Teaching Award to make recommenda­
tions to improve facilities.
Upon acceptance of their proposals, 
the University’s Capital Resource and 
Capital Allocation Boards set the annual 
appropriation for classroom renovations 
at $300,000. This provided the impetus 
for the formation of the Educational 
Facilities Committee, which continues 
to set renovation priorities.
The expressed purpose of the commit­
tee has been the improvement, of regis- 
rar-controlled, or common classrooms, 
as opposed to departmentally-operated 
rooms.
The committee itself is made up of rep­
resentatives from several colleges and 
academic departments, Physical Plant, 
Instructional Technology, Academic 
Computing, the Registrar’s Office, Uni­
versity Planning, and the University 
Teaching Center.
As chair of the committee, Fenton has 
seen significant progress in renovating 
and modernizing classrooms and facili­
ties.
All of the University’s lecture halls, 
including DH 2210 and DH 2315, as well 
as the 44 registrar-controlled classrooms 
were brought up to new standards in 
heating, ventilation, and air condition­
ing (HVAC), as well as in lighting and
acoustics.
Each of these measures required con­
siderable modifications. In order to 
upgrade acoustics in classrooms, for 
example, the committee had new ceil­
ings installed, carpeted floors, added 
sound-deadening pads to walls, and 
draperies to windows. In many cases, 
other amenities, such as modern sliding 
chalkboards, and furnishings were also 
added.
Perhaps one of the most significant 
changes to be made by the committee 
was the addition of audio-visual equip­
ment cabinets to every classroom and 
lecture hall in the University.
Each of these contain an overhead 
projector, chalk, erasers, and many con­
tain additional equipment such as VCRs, 
film projectors, and sound equipment. 
Previously, all AV equipment had to be 
obtained from Instructional Technology 
by request, with an associated delivery 
charge.
Traditionally, all planning and bid­
ding has been done during the academic 
year, so that actual construction can be 
undertaken over the summer. As the 
construction director for the project, 
Physical Plant’s Tom Murphy, put it,

On February 8, MEMS graduate 
student Running Jiang was killed in 
a car accident. He came from China 
to CMU in 1986 after meeting Pro­
fessor R.J. Fruehan.
Since his arrival, he passed the 
PhD qualifying examination and 
most recently was doing basic re­

According to Fruehan, “Ruiming 
was a very considerate person, al­
ways willing to go out of his way to 
help his fellow graduate students.” 
Yuting Zhang, one of Ruiming’s 
closest friends, describes him as “an 
easy man to meet, very caring and 
clever. He learned things quickly and 
did all things well. He was always 
there to help.”
Ruiming was the husband of Hong-

Chatham students fight proposed move to coeducation in 1991
vsERNEVC7 a8su PAHC L
sider going to a women’s college. 
Of that group, only three percent 
actually attend.
Diggs asserts, however, that the 
pool of potential students is not 
shrinking. She says that, rather 
than making the school coeduca­
tional, allowing the current stu­
dents to go on recruiting drives 
may help increase enrollment.
But, according to Beckwith, 
there will be even fewer women 
wanting to attend single-sex col­
leges in the near future.
That is the reason, says Staf­
ford, that the trustees are now se­
riously considering admitting 
men. “At least once a year, 
women’s colleges study the feasi­
bility of going coeducational,” said 
Stafford. She feels that the time 
is ripe for Chatham to make the 
switch. That is why she backed 
the proposal which, if passed by 
Chatham’s Board of Trustees on 
April 22, would open the doors to 
men for the 1991-92 school year.
Diggs says that two months is 
not enough time for the students 
to compile the information they 
believe could keep the Trustees 
from voting for coeducation. “We 
are going to ask the trustees to 
table the proposal for one year,” 
said Diggs.
Four task forces have been set 
up by the administration and 
Trustees which will help in the 
decision process. Each will look at 
different aspects of the college, 
including the school’s facilities 
and finances, changes in curricu­
lum, admissions and marketing 
strategies, and the school’s 
“uniqueness.”
According to Stafford, the trus­
tees feel confident because of the 
success of other women’s colleges 
that have gone coed, including 
Vassar and Wheaton.
The trend in going to coeduca­
tion has been around for a long 
time. In 1960 there were 298 
women’s colleges in the U.S. In 
1970, Chatham did an extensive 
survey into the possibility of going 
coed. At the time there were 140 
women’s colleges, but the school 
felt that the future still looked 
bright. The school’s enrollment 
peaked in the latter half of the 
decade to over 700 students.
But there are currently 94 
women’s colleges in the country 
and Stafford believes that since 
the pool of potential students is 
going down, even more single-sex 
colleges all over the country will 
eventually go coed. “There will be 
very few women’s schools left,” 
she says.
Demographics aside, the stu­
dents and alumnae are not happy. 
Protests and rallies rocked the 
pristine Shadyside campus last 
week. Students waved banners 
crying, “Better dead than coed.”
According to Kulick, there is a 
sense of animosity between the 
students and the administration. 
“There was a lot of contention 
following the announcement,” she 
says. “The protests were to make 
a statement to the president.”
The animosity is attributed to 
thé fact that the announcement 
was such a surprise. “They never 
consulted the students about 
[going coed],” says Diggs. In the 
four years she has been studying 
at Chatham, Diggs says that she 
had never heard of the possibility 
of the school going coed.
Kulick says, “We always heard 
that it would never happen here.”
Grande sums up the opinion 
that the school is turning its back 
on its students. “Everything we 
were told about the value of a 
single-sex education is false now,” 
she says.
Beckwith is quick to point out 
that the administration is open to 
and supports the feelings of the 
student body. “We are completely 
understanding,” she says. “When 
there is a need for changes im­
posed on you by outside systems, 
you have to change.”
Senior Class Presideht Jennifer 
Gold says that immediate stu­
dent reaction varied, with a few 
students being indifferent or even 
favoring the idea of Chatham 
going coed. “There are a few of us 
that are actively opposing [the 
proposal],” she said. “We’re tak­
ing a back seat because the un­
derclass is taking a more active 
role.”
Gold, a political science major, 
says that she thinks the student 
body feels deceived. She says that 
there is a lack of trust in the 
administration at the moment and 
that there is a lot of animosity 
which would inevitably continue 
for the first year or two if Chatham 
goes coed.
Both Grande and Kulick say 
that the initial student response 
was somewhat out of control and 
reactionary. “There was no or­
ganization,” says Grande.
Diggs then stepped in and 
brought things under control. “I 
was trying to get the students to 
look at both sides of the issue,” 
she says.
Diggs organized a meeting last 
Saturday in which ten student 
committees were established, 
each with a specific task. Alum­
nae support, school history, and 
demographics are some of the 
committees. Diggs says that the 
information gathered by these 
groups will formulate the proposal 
which will ask the Trustees to 
table the proposal to go coed.
Alumnae reaction to the pro­
posal, according to Beckwith, has 
been mixed. Beckwith says that

the school’s oldest living alumnae 
reportedly responded, “It is high 
time,” when told about the pro­
posal.
Charlotte Black, a voice teacher 
at Carnegie Mellon, graduated 
from Chatham in the mid-70s. 
She is opposed to the idea of 
admitting men. “The school won’t 
be as good,” she says. Black also 
never heard of the possibility that 
the school would become co-edu- 
cational, even when she was a 
student.
Black says that she enjoyed her 
years at Chatham. “It was a re­
ally good learning situation.” She 
said that being at an all-women’s 
school gave a strength of person­
ality to the students and enabled 
the students to formulate strong 
personal convictions.
Kulick says that such qualities 
still exist at the school. “A lot of
the education we receive here is 
not in the classroom,” she says. 
“Chatham gives us a strength. 
We have the confidence that we 
can compete with men out in the 
job market.”
Speculating on what the school 
would be like if the resolution 
passes, Beckwith believes the 
kind of men who would come to 
Chatham would be, “young men 
who want an urban setting but 
want a small classical college.” 
Chatham earned a rating of one, 
the Carnegie Commission’s high­
est score for a liberal arts college.
Beckwith says that this is the 
reason why almost all of the 
school’s students decide to come 
to Chatham. “Women come here 
in spite of the fact that we’re a 
woman’s college,” she says.
But the students claim that the 
reason they are protesting so
adamantly against going coed is 
because they came to Chatham 
mainly because it was and is a 
single-sex college.
Stafford maintains that these 
claims are reactionary. “If you 
ask the students now. why they 
came here, they will tell you it 
was because Chatham was an all­
women’s school. But, at the time 
they applied, they said they were 
doing so because Chatham was 
simply a very good school,” she 
says.
As for the charges that the 
school would lose its sense of iden­
tity, a charge addressed in an 
editorial in last Friday’s Pitts­
burgh Post-Gazette, Stafford be­
lieves that such changes are based 
on choices. “You do not have to 
choose to lose your identity,” she 
says.
Beckwith says that the only 
change in the school’s mission 
would be that it would now in­
clude men. “We won’t be a 
women’s college,” she says, “we 
would be a college.”
Stafford reiterates that if the 
trustees vote to admit men, it 
would be just one of a series of 
steps the school is planning on 
taking for its future growth. But 
that growth is dependant on get­
ting more students. She said the 
planning is being done based on 
the question, “What would we do 
with more students?” not just 
more men or women. Some 
those plans involve constructing 
dormitories and a new science 
building.
However, such projects require 
money, and alumna Black asserts 
that if the school goes coed, “J 
won’t give any money to them.”
If the coed proposal passes, 
there is little likelihood of 
Chatham and Carnegie Melloj 
contending for students. “I don’t 
think Chatham going coed wil] 
have much of an impact,” says 
Michael Steidel, Carnegie 
Mellon’s director of admissions, 
“The two schools do not have much 
of an [admissions] overlap. They 
are pretty much different places.
Stafford agrees, saying that 
because Carnegie Mellon is 
technically oriented, male-donri 
nated school, a woman who would 
want to go to Chatham would 
probably not want to go to Carne­
gie Mellon.
Tonight, the students plan to 
hold a candlelight vigil and march 
to Stafford’s house as another 
statement of their unity and 
opposition to coeducation.

All current undergraduates are eligible 
to reserve rooms in University Housing 
for the 1990-1991 academic year.
All students who wish to reserve a space in 
University housing must pay a $100 
Housing Deposit during February. Current 
residents should go directly to the Cashier’s 
Office to pay this deposit. Students who are not 
currently residents should report first to the 
Housing Office to have a deposit slip prepared 
for them prior to going to the Cashier’s Office.
The Room Draw Process to be held during 
the 2nd & 3rd weeks of March is the room 
selection procedure for current residents.
Any non-residents who are designated as 
roommates for next year by current residents 
should stop by the Housing Office between 
March 19th and March 23rd to confirm that 
designation and sign a Housing License 
Agreement.
All other non-residents who wish to select a 
space in University housing should stop by the 
Housing Office at any time during April and they 
will be able to select rooms and sign Housing 
License Agreements on a first-come, first-served 
basis.

IBM unveiled its new line of UNIX 
vorkstations last week. The RISC Sys­
tem/6000 family of computers promises 
to be nearly twice as fast as some of the 
fastest workstations currently on cam­
pus.
The fastest workstations currently 
supported by the University, DecStation
IBM presents new line of Andrew compatible workstations
3100s, operate at 14 million instructions 
per second (MIPS). IBM’s new POWER- 
station 320, the machine on the low end 
of their RISC System/6000 line will 
operate at 27.5 MIPS.
In addition to their increased comput­
ing power, these machines also feature 
AIX/6000, IBM’s version of UNIX opti­
mized for the RISC System 6000 series of 
machines. IBM’s new version of AIX 
includes a host of new features that make
UNIX more user-friendly than in the 
past.
According to a statement released by 
Transarc, the company responsible for 
the Andrew File System, AFS version 
3.0 will be running on the new machines 
sometime this summer. Transarc’s AFS 
conversion will allow the new machines 
to be used along with the Andrew sys­
tem, offering the new features of the AIX 
operating system along with the func­
tionality of the AFS.
The Information Technology Center, a 
joint venture of Carnegie Mellon and 
IBM, is also planning a port of their 
MACH operating system to the new 
machines for internal use by the Carne­
gie Mellon research community, accord­
ing to ITC Director John Howard.
The University currently has no fixed 
plans to purchase these new machines. 
“It looks like a very nice piece of hard­
ware, but there are a lot of questions,” 
said William Arms, vice president for 
Academic Services. “And we know that 
their competitors are not sitting still.” 
IBM plans to make the entry level 
machine available to the campus com­
munity for $7742. The price includes a
27.5 MIPS machine, with a 120 mega­
byte hard drive, 8 megabytes of main 
memory and a 19 inch monochrome 
monitor.

2/10 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
;5l pm. A Campus Police officer 
loticed the gate arm to the CFA 
marking lot in the up position even 
though no one had placed it out of 
¡ervice. A security guard radioed 
;hat a passenger in a red Chev- 
;olet van had pushed on the gate 
irm causing the arm to raise up 
ind stay. Two officers and the 
juard approached the van as the
occupants were exiting it. After 
being questioned by the officers, 
an occupant of the van stated that 
he jiggled the arm, causing it to 
raise. He was informed that he 
might be liable for damages to the 
gate mechanism, and he re­
sponded that any problems should 
be referred to someone from AB 
Tech, who had hired the man’s 
band, and that the parking direc­
tions had instructed them to drive 
up to and through the gate. A 
traffic monitor later reported that 
there was damage to the gate box 
and that a repairman would be 
needed.
2/10 MEDICAL, 8:05 pm. A 
student’s dorm room window was 
stuck and when he attempted to 
bang on the window frame to 
loosen it, his right hand went
through the window, lacerating 
his right thumb. The reporting 
officer used gauze pads to control 
the bleeding and transported the 
victim to Presbyterian University 
Hospital.
2/11 THEFT, 12:45 am. Un­
known person(s) removed a ring 
of keys from the Phi Mu Alpha 
lock on the mezzanine level of 
CFA. The key ring contained
approximately fifteen keys, in­
cluding CFA room keys, car keys, 
and apartment keys.
2/11 POSSESSION OF 
SUSPECTED MARIJUANA, 
2:20 am. While on patrol at the 
Beaux Arts Ball, a plain-clothes 
Carnegie Mellon Police officer 
observed two men sitting on the 
window sill in the third floor 
men’s room. One of the men was
seen attempting to roll a ciga­
rette. In his lap was a clear plastic 
bag containing what was de­
scribed by the investigator as 
“green vegetable matter” sus­
pected to be marijuana and also a 
cigarette whose tobacco had been 
removed. The man was informed 
of the investigator’s identity and 
was asked to accompany the in-

advantageous for the University. 
I know some students think that 
pacliing and research are con- 
trary to each other,” he says, “but 
don’t see that as being accurate, 
think that people are better 
jjeachers when they are so in- 
olved with their disciplines.”
‘'In a university like this,” Cyert 
Dntinues, “where the faculty are 
ei'y active in their professions, I 
iel that you’re generally going to 
et a better education — [the 
Metiers] don’t go stale.”
Cyert doesn’t think it’s likely 
Shat decreasing research monies 
ill force the University to make 
lculty cuts. Instead, he suggests 
‘at the faculty size will adjust on 8 own. “I think it will .-happen
naturally,“ he says. “If research 
gets decreased, there will be fewer 
research grants around and less 
research activity.”
Sekerka sees the same poten­
tial problems Cyert does. “I’ve 
been aware of the same cuts,” he 
says. “It will produce some budget 
pressure. How one solves it is 
another matter.”
“Other solutions aren’t obvious,” 
says Sekerka, acknowledging the 
possibility of personnel cuts. “We 
just may have to go through, a 
period of re-entrenchment of fac­
ulty and administration.”
Cyert hinted at the possibility 
of reducing the size of the faculty 
by about 35 at last Monday’s 
meeting of the Board of Trustees. 
“I’ve always thought of keeping
the faculty around the 500 size,” 
he says, “but because of increased 
research, it has gone up to around 
535.”
What does Sekerka think about 
the faculty cut? “It is certainly 
substantial — it wouldn’t be 
looked upon favorably. Hopefully 
some positions can be taken 
through natural attrition as op­
posed to letting people go.”
Presently, there are no specific 
plans for cuts. “The only way that 
I think faculty size would go 
down,” says Cyert, “is if we were 
to limit some research activities. 
Right now we are happy with the 
way things are, and we are only 
looking to the future and saying 
What will happen if....’ It’s part of 
managing the University.”

ividence that his corporate and 
nilitary connections alienated the 
HIT community from his agenda, 
riiich he toted with authoritar- 
an-style leadership.
Last month he announced that 
le was no longer a candidate for 
;he MIT presidency and that he 
vould step down so that the new 
»resident could name a provost. 
The announcement of the con­
tusion of the MIT search, which 
¦tarted last April, comes on the 
leels ofthe conclusion of the Johns 
lopkins search last month.
As late as January, Carnegie 
»iellon’s search committees had 
lot yet completed a “short list” of 
:andidates for consideration. But 
hat didn’t concern officials close 
;o the search here, who say that 
hey will not force the search to a 
»remature conclusion.
Officials at both Carnegie Mel­
on and MIT downplayed the 
mpact that the searches had upon 
ach other. “MIT is no longer 
Joking at a pool of candidates,” 
xplained Walter Milne, who was 
nvolved with one of the MIT

search committees. “If we were 
competing, we’re not now.”
Nor did Milne think that the 
MIT announcement would 
strongly impact the Carnegie 
Mellon search. “We have recom­
mended a person who will accept 
[the position] if elected, and that’s 
one less person for anybody else 
to consider,” he told The Tartan.
“I don’t know that itwould have
any impact [on the Carnegie 
Mellon search],” said Fetkovich. 
“I think that if the MIT search 
had any impact on our search, it 
probably was something that hap­
pened a considerable time ago.” 
Fetkovich refused to elaborate 
further on the Carnegie Mellon 
search. “As time goes on, we come 
increasingly closer to more sensi­
tive levels,” he said.

“the day after commencement we go like 
blazes.” Time, obviously, is of the es­
sence in such undertakings, but Murphy 
added that “somehow we’ve always 
Managed to get everything back together 
on time.”
As for the future, the committee’s plans 
iare no less energetic: This summer will 
see a massive renovation of Wean Hall 
7500, as well as 10 rooms in CFA which 
Fenton referred to as being among “the 
worst in the University.”
Also on the agenda is the replacement 
of 50-year-old seating in DH 2210 and 
2315 at a projected cost of $133,430, 
based on a bid by American Seating. Still 
another agenda item is the installation 
of additional satellite downlinks into 
Classes around the campus—the Adam- 
ison Wing and CFA 314 among them — 
and an uplink and video classroom to
televise classes for broadcast to other 
institutions and private businesses.
As for long range goals, the committee 
would like to construct another compu­
terized classroom, which would serve as 
an open cluster at night 
Concurrent with the committee’s ef­
forts have been renovations by specific 
departments — like English, Statistics, 
and Design — in areas that fall under 
their auspices.
There is, of course, more work to be 
done in bringing all areas of the Univer­
sity up to the same standards, as some 
facilities still remain substandard in 
HVAC, lighting, and basic aesthetics.
But many of the problems that still 
remain stem from poor scheduling rather 
than through any faults of the facilities 
themselves. Many refurbished class­
rooms in Scaife Hall, for example, are 
often filled beyond practical capacity.

Vanishing jackets baffle partygoers, fraternities

coat vanished, a leather jacket was 
removed from an inside closet on the 
first floor of Delta Tau Delta. The next 
night, two leather jackets were missed 
from a Sigma Nu party. On January 26, 
two leather coats and a cotton and wool 
top coat were removed during a Kappa 
Sigma party. Another jacket was report­
edly removed January 27 from a first- 
floor coat rack at Theta Xi.
Sergeant William F. Kozikowski of 
Campus Security believes that many of 
these occurrences are accidental in na­
ture. “I don’t think people are taking 
these jackets deliberately,” he says. “They 
go to these parties, hang or leave their
• coat somewhere, and later pick up the 
wrongjacket by mistake.” In some fortu­
nate cases, the coat is returned.
Others, however, haven?t been so lucky.
Junior Anne Heinle had her jacket
removed from a Beta Theta Pi party on 
January 27. “There was a table at the top 
of the stairs where everyone was leaving 
their coats,” Heinle says. “I put mine at 
the very back of the pile, so I would be 
able to find it easily. When it came time 
to leave, it was gone. It was a CMU 
varsity jacket, and I know it could have 
easily been taken by accident, but I had 
some personal belongings in the pockets. 
Whoever took it would have realized 
later that it wasn’t theirs.” Heinle has 
not seen her jacket since that night.
After Lauren Sroczynski’s leather 
jacket was removed from a DTD party on 
February 2, she put up posters advertis­
ing a reward in hopes of regaining it. As 
of February 17, her jacket had also not 
been recovered.
Investigator William T. Kaiser of 
Campus Security said that fraternities 
“must take responsibility for what goes

would be able to find it easily. When it came 
time to leave, it was gone.... Whoever took it 
would have realized later that it wasn't

on” and see that “all aspects of functions 
are well planned... including organizing 
people to watch the coats.” He stresses 
that people should use some common 
sense and take “some reasonable meas­
ure to prevent theft.”
Phi Kappa Theta’s social chairman, 
Jack Kingsley, offers this piece of advice 
to fraternity party-goers. “Don’t bring
expensive items to a fraternity where 
there are lots of strange people who are 
drunk.”
Barry Slawter, president of Pi Kappa 
Alpha, agrees. “Anybody who brings a 
$700 coat to a fraternity party is kind of 
stupid.”
If you can’t leave their them at home, 
Bodio suggests, “Put it in someone’s room
— someone you know well.”
Bodio’s suggestion is echoed by the 
fraternities. Eric Heiman, vice president 
of DTD, and Ron Domitrovic, ho 
manager of Theta Xi, both advocate stor- 
ingjackets upstairs in the brothers’ rooms 
if possible to avoid theft or accidental 
removal. Other ideas which are in the 
works are getting better security on coat 
closets and instituting a brother or pledg( 
coat checking system.
According to Carnegie Mellon Police) 
Chief James LaPaglia, the safest method 
of preventing j ackets from being stolen is 
not to part with them. “Obviously if you 
have a coat of any value, either keep it 
with you or make sure that whoever you 
leave it with stores it in an area where 
access is limited.”

changes

According to Carnegie Mellon 
Police Chief James LaPaglia, 
Gallo has been shown several 
photos and has been unable to 
positively identify any of them.
LaPaglia says that the method 
used by the offender to obtain the 
loan is similar to past incidents at 
other schools.
Obtaining emergency loans has 
been quite simple in the past — 
all a student had to do was to fill 
out a request at the Student Af­
fairs Office, where a clerk would 
record and authorize most loans. 
In some instances, the loans would 
be approved by the associate dean 
before they were issued.
According to Acting Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy, 
the procedure has been changed 
slightly in a way which he hopes 
will prevent this problem in the 
future.
Now, students who want an 
emergency loan must fill out a 
revised application that requires 
additional information.
Murphy said that he hopes that 
the new form will allow students’ - 
credit histories to be examined so 
that large sums of money will not 
be issued to students with poor 
credit histories.
In addition to the new form, the 
application process no longer 
features “instant approval.” Ap­
plications submitted before 5 pm 
will not be evaluated until noon 
the next day.
“If this were a chronic problem, 
we’d probably focus more atten­
tion on it,” Murphy said. “But if 
there have been 10,000 emergency 
loans issued and only one case 
has been a problem of this kind— 
well, that’s a rate I can live with.”
Murphy said that the new pro­
cedures were designed to deter 
others hoping to pull off the same 
sort of trick.
He said he still feels that stu­
dents should be able to receive an 
emergency loan with relative ease. 
“There’s an ease of access to stu­
dent loans, and that’s a good 
thing,” he said.
He also emphasized that the 
Office of Student Affairs wants to 
remain true to the original intent 
of the emergency loan program, 
which uses endowed funds con­
tributed with the idea that “some­
times students get in a jam.”
which also promotes Jewish 
awareness among its members. 
The request was accepted by ac­
clamation.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 20 February 19907
Human Relations Commission deals with sensitive issues
By KRISFEN HENLEY
Tartan Staffwriter
Cross burning in Slippery Rock, ethnic 
graffitti spray painted on businesses and 
private homes in Boston suburbs on the 
eve of Ytai Kippur: These are blatant 
examples of hatred and discrimination. 
More subtle, everyday counterparts of 
these acts are a part of most people’s 
lives.
To coinbat such acts here, Carnegie 
Mellon President Richard M. Cyert cre­
ated the Human Relations Commision 
last March to address and combat the 
presence of intolerance in its various 
forms oh campus.
In a memo explaining the commission’s 
formation, Cyert explains, “We must 
resolve to eliminate the insensitivities 
that may unnecessarily wound other 
members of our community.... We must 
make Carnegie Mellon into a campus 
that encourages mutual respect.”
“The diversity which is evident on our 
own campus,” he says, “has been a major 
strength of America throughout his­
tory.:- : Cohesiveness achieved by an 
appreciation of common goals, but with a 
respect for individual diversity, is vital 
both for Carnegie Mellon and the United 
States.
“[The commission] will set the stan­
dards for the kinds of inter-personal 
relations we want to foster on this cam- 
. pus,” says Cyert. “It will be a forward- 
looking group that will act as an over­
sight committee and will recommend pro­
grams and actions aimed at enhancing 
mutual respect on the campus.”
The commission, chaired by Vice Presi­
dent for Enrollment William Elliott, is 
composed of 21 individuals ranging from 
undergraduates to administrators. All 
commission members were nominated 
by various people from faculty and stu­
dent boards, as well as by Cyert. Some 
positions are rotating ones while others 
are permanent.
“The HRC is not, in and of itself, a 
hearing board,” explains Elliott, “but 
rather exists to insure that the mecha­
nisms that are alive on campus are 
working.”
The commission has had two meetings 
to date. The first was last November. 
Main agenda issues were the discussion 
of a campus sensitivity memo, the final 
report of the Sexual Harrassment Task 
Force, the Racial Harrassment Policy 
statement, and the Statement of Assur­
ance.
The revised Statement of Assurance 
declares that Carnegie Mellon “does not 
discriminate in admissions and employ­
ment on the base of race, color, national 
origin, sex, or handicap ... [orl on the 
basis of religion, creed, ancestry, belief, 
age, veteran status, sexual orientation, 
or in violation of any federal, state, or 
local laws or executive orders.”
Also at this meeting, members received 
some reading materials, mainly on the 
First Amendment. “Tryingto define what 
constitutesharrassmentis difficult,” says 
Elliott.
"The Human Relations Commission is not, in 
and of itself, a hearing board, but rather ex­
ists to insure that the mechanisms that are 
alive on campus are working.”
— William Elliott, 
vice president for enrollment
Interpretation is further complicated 
because of the various interpretations of 
theFirst Amendment. According to one 
of the handouts from The Chronicle of 
Higher Education, some legal scholars 
“would permit public universities to 
restrict offensive and harrassing speech 
that others argue is protected by the 
First Amendment.”
This leeway is legitimized because 
universities are seen as having a vested 
interest in promoting racial harmony 
and tolerance. ‘The commission’s bot­
tom line is trying to determine what’s 
the socially and morally acceptable be­
havior of a community of students, fac­
ulty, and staff on a college campus,” says 
Elliot.
This same article suggests devising a 
committee representing all levels of the 
institution which will look carefully into 
the problem before devising a policy 
which it makes public to all members of 
the community. Thus far, Carnegie 
Mellon has followed these steps. The
committee has heard complaints and is 
in the process of drafting several poli­
cies. The commission also hopes to send 
out a newsletter complementing its meet­
ings which describes its motives and 
actions.
The second meeting, on February 8, 
included status reports on such policy 
statements as the Racial Harrassment 
Statement, the Sexual Harrassment 
Statement, and the updated Statement 
of Assurance. Other* issues addressed 
were the HRC newsletter, harrassment 
through computer b-boards, human re­
lations training for commission mem­
bers, the role of the HRC in the event of 
a human relations incident, freshmen 
orientation, and discussion about Office 
of Civil Rights investigations concerning 
admissions.
The question, says Elliott, is this: “How 
do you bring about awareness of the 
qualities of distinction? It has to become 
part of the environment to become part 
of the lifestyle and so on.”
This brings up questions of the 
administration’s and the faculty’s role as 
educators of these issues. Elliott asks, 
“Pushing back the frontiers of knowl­
edge, should we have a required course 
on this issue or do a variety of things 
throughout the year?”
Elliott feels that pro-tolerance materi­
als should be presented in courses where 
appropriate and also in visiting lecture 
schedules and through Student Affairs 
activities. Along these lines, he is co­
teaching an H&SS Honors Seminar, 
entitled-Diuersiiy, American Society, and 
America’s Campuses.
Taught with Alan Kennedy of the 
English Department and Linda Watkins 
of the Provost’s Office, the course is in­
tended to make students aware of the 
concerns and nature of our multi-cul- 
tural society and to explore the role and 
possibilities that the University has in 
promoting greater understanding.
Already there have been some com­
plaints about this course impinging on 
individual’s rights by attempting to re- 
teach or re-socialize, thereby taking on a 
“big brother” attitude. Needless to say, 
the instructors disagree, saying it is. a 
right to be allowed to choose the class.
This commission considers its work of 
crucial importance. These issues of 
“qualities of distinction” are encountered 
daily and affect our lives often without 
detection. Says Elliott, “We have to get 
over this stuff if we’re going to think 
about living as one country, let alone one 
world.”
C&l report: Flagpole swingers pulled from action by police
continued from page 5
vestigator to the first floor. While 
accompanying the investigator, 
the man attempted to flee but 
was caught. The man was taken 
to CFA room 110 where he stated 
'that he found the substance on 
the bathroom floor. He had a false 
Pennsylvania driver’s license, 
which was confiscated. He was is­
sued an internal citation and 
removed from the ball.
2/11 THEFT, before 4:15 am. A 
student reported that her coat 
was missing from the Beaux Arts 
Ball coat check area. The coat 
was described as a long black 
overcoat with two buttons miss- 
|ing and clear buttons on the in­
side.
2/11 THEFT, before 4:30 am. A 
student reported that someone 
had removed her black leather 
jacket from the Beaux Arts Ball 
pat check area. The jacket had 
three buttons: an Amnesty Inter­
national pin, a Silver Naster 
medal, and a Beaux Arts Ball pin.
2/11 UNAUTHORIZED SO­
LICITATION, 4:30 pm. A resi­
dent of Hamerschlag House called 
Campus Police to inform them of 
aman soliciting money for United
Appalachian Relief. A respond­
ing officer encountered the man 
on the third floor of A-Tower. He 
was informed by the officer that 
he would need permission from 
the Dean of Student Affairs to 
solicit on campus and that he 
would be arrested if stopped again 
on campus for soliciting without 
permission. Those Hamerschlag 
residents who had contributed to 
UAR were refunded their money 
and they returned the T-shirts 
that the man had given them.
2/12 THEFT. An MSHA em­
ployee reported that a copy of a 
database application for IBM and 
compatible computers was miss­
ing from a desk cabinet in room A- 
161 of Hamburg Hall. The pro­
gram was valued at $500.
2/12 SUSPICIOUS PERSON, 
6:05 pm. Carnegie Mellon Police 
received a report of a man near 
the Hamburg Hall auditorium 
who had asked the complainant 
for money because his wife and 
children were in Children’s Hos­
pital, and bus fare from Union- 
town to the hospital had cost him 
$27.50. Responding officers found 
the man on the corner of Fifth and 
Bellefield. The man stated that
he had been in Hamburg Hall 
asking for money, but he did not 
have a wife or child in the hospi­
tal; he had just needed money. He 
said that he was very sorry for 
causing problems and that he 
would never come back to cam­
pus. He was warned that if he did 
return, he would be arrested and 
charged with trespassing.
2/12 HOUSING VIOLATION, 
10:16 pm. Campus Police officers 
responded to a report of an odor of 
gas in Mudge B-Tower. The offi­
cers learned that a resident was 
operating a butane gas stove unit 
inside his room. He was told that 
use of such a cooking appliance 
was prohibited in residence halls. 
The unit was confiscated by the 
University.
2/13 PROWLINGATNIGHT, 
9:15 pm. An anonymous person 
notified a Carnegie Mellon secu­
rity guard that three young men 
were looking into vehicles parked 
on Tech Street. The three had last 
been seen walking toward Mar­
garet Morrison Street. The young 
men were observed by a respond­
ing sergeant looking inside ve­
hicles on Margaret Morrison. He 
then observed them trying to
sneak into Donner Hall. The ser­
geant confronted them in the 
Donner front entrance. One of the 
young men had a piece of an auto­
mobile ignition lock in his jacket 
pocket. All three men are cur­
rently on probation with Al­
legheny County Juvenile Court. 
2/14 DISORDERLY CON­
DUCT, 3:11 am. A Carnegie 
Mellon Police sergeant observed 
three men swinging on and climb­
ing up the flagpole rope on the 
Cut. When the sergeant ap­
proached, the men fled. The ser­
geant and two other officers pur­
sued the men and apprehended 
two of them near the east side of
Skibo. Neither man had positive 
identification, so they were trans­
ported to a fraternity house where 
they produced ID. The third actor 
was also later apprehended. No 
apparent damage was done to the 
flagpole.

You probably won’t have to 
stretch too much for this one, but 
imagine that you’re a college stu­
dent with a bright future.
You work hard. Despite occa­
sional problems, your life is good.
Then one day you find out that 
you, or your girlfriend, is preg­
nant.
All of a sudden, your life has 
changed forever. No matter what 
action you decide to take — adop­
tion, abortion, marriage, or what­
ever — there will be costs that 
you’ll have to pay. Forever.
You’d probably ask yourself over 
and over, “What could I have done 
to prevent this?”
It’s a complicated question, one 
to which we have devoted this 
entire issue of Karnege, our 
monthly magazine. But there are 
a few simple answers.
One answer is to abstain from 
sex altogether. It is clearly the 
only completely safe method to 
avoid unplanned pregnancy.
However, abstinence is an un­
popular option among many 
couples, and it isn’t the only an­
swer. Many methods of birth con-
AE7 ysV8 aVRV8C
trol exist and, when properly used, 
can be highly effective.
Which technique to use is a 
personal decision that should be 
left to the couple involved. How­
ever, we strongly urge you to use 
some reliable form of birth control 
when you have sex. Two popular 
methods we recommend are the 
birth control pill and the condom.
When used properly and consis­
tently, the pill is nearly totally 
effective and doesn’t require ac­
tion that interrupts a romantic 
moment. It may be especially at­
tractive to students because one 
of its main drawbacks — adverse 
health effects — is primarily lim­
ited to women in identifiable risk 
groups and women over 35.
Another option is the condom. 
Condoms are cheap, require much 
less advance planning than the 
pill, and have the added benefit of 
protecting both parties from dis­
ease. However, condoms are not 
as effective as the pill and may 
take a little while to put on.
Whatever your decision, we urge 
you to use caution when you have 
sex. It’s your future at stake.

‘No Smoking’ laws must be enforced
Editor:
Due to recent prob­
lems with my finan­
cial aid, I have had to 
visit the Financial Aid 
Office in Warner Hall 
several times. Each time, .1 emerged 
coughing and reeking of cigarette smoke.
Funny, I thought Warner Hall, like
9CRRC8 Rs 
RIC 17NRs8
all other campus buildings, was a non­
smoking area. Those of us who choose not 
to smoke do not want to breathe others’ 
contaminated air. Yet when I go to Finan­
cial Aid, that is exactly what I’m forced to 
do. I wouldn’t mind if employees smoked 
in offices behind closed doors. But em­
ployees in Financial Aid smoke in com­
mon, non-office areas. They walk around
toting lit cigars and cigarettes near the 
front desk and waiting areas.
I’m tired of the blatant disregard for 
the white lettering these employees see 
every day upon entering the building. 
Why was the law passed if it’s not going 
to be enforced?

®et f ,™ue’ ÜÎÎÏÏ! ™irai" *!? cut Columnist manipulated facts and ideasEvery February, as the Pitts­
burgh climate makes its annual 
turn for the worse and the rainfall 
amounts are measured, not in 
inches, but in yards, we at The 
Tartan find that, once again, we 
have to deliver a real-world re­
minder to the Administration and 
to Physical Plant. We’d like them 
to take heed of one obvious fact:
CMU students, faculty, and staff 
are not amphibious.
In Pittsburgh, in the winter, it 
rains. Whenitrains, sidewalks on 
campus get flooded, and the Cut 
becomes “Lake Andrew.” Inevita­
bly and invariably. Every winter. 
Without fail.
You would think, after a few 
years of this, some bright soul in 
Physical Plant or the Planning 
Office might notice, while slosh­
ing to work one morning, that a 
problem exists. You would think 
that endless complaints and re­
ports might ignite some flicker of 
response from those installers-of- 
adequate-drainage. You would 
think that after a century of Pitts­
burgh weather and rain, someone 
might catch on that the Cut does 
a remarkably good imitation of a 
swamp and the sidewalks are dead
ringers for small ponds.
1 You would be wrong.
We’ve said this so many times 
that it’s taking on chant-like as­
pects. Given that the Cut has lousy 
drainage, that master plans have 
come and gone in the past, that 
Pittsburgh weather is unpredict­
able at best and wretched at worst 
— isn’t it possible to reduce or 
eliminate the water that lurks all 
over campus?
It’s messy. It’s ugly. It makes 
the campus look half-finished. It’s 
uncomfortable to walk through. 
It’s really uncomfortable to sit in 
classes for hours with wet shoes 
after having walked through it. 
There have got to be a thousand 
reasons not to have puddles all 
over the place.
If there’s some physical or fi­
nancial reason why water on the 
sidewalks is necessary to the 
continued smooth functioning of 
the University, by all means tell 
us about it, and we’ll suffer in si­
lence.
Ifthere isn’t— andsomehowwe 
doubt that there is — then find a 
way to drain Lake Andrew before 
the next rainy season comes 
around later this week.

Michael Drout’s 
banic thesis in his 
recent series of col­
umns [“ ‘Re-education’ 
programs threaten 
CMIPs diversity,” 1/23; “Academic free­
dom threatened by harassment policy,” 
1/30; “Doubts about University’s ‘Diver­
sity’ campaign,” 2/13] is that human re­
lations efforts on campus promote re­
pression, instead of encouraging dia­
logue. However, dialogue is by nature a 
two-way street. And, while Mr. Drout 
has tried to portray himself as a con­
cerned student, in actuality it seems he 
has (1) manipulated facts and (2) sup­
ported, and even encouraged counter­
productive attempts at intimidation in 
order to “get his point across.”
•Mr. Drout says “a committee formed 
by Student Affairs recently recom­
mended that a certain CMU student it 
thinks has ‘an attitude offensive to the 
University as a whole,’ ‘be required to 
become involved in various programs of 
diversity offered by the Division of Stu­
dent Affairs.’ ” The committee was not 
“formed.” It is CMU’s standing discipli­
nary committee, containing two stu­
dents, two faculty, and an administra­
tor who votes only in the case of a tie. 
The student did make offensive com­
ments during the incident the hearing 
was investigating; however, as the pri­
mary witness in this case, I attended the 
hearing on the condition that I could 
limit my objection to the threats of physi­
cal violence the student had made. Mr. 
Drout knows all of this because he was 
the student’s character witness at the 
hearing.
•Mr. Drout maintains that no one 
argues against those who claim the SAT 
is racist and sexist, because to argue as 
such would risk incurring the “storm 
trooper tactics” of “liberal” groups. In 
fact, a cursory look at The Chronicle of 
Higher Education, the New York Times, 
or even U. will reveal many arguments 
on both sides concerning the SAT.
• In his most recent article, Mr. Drout 
says that people who argue with so-
called pro-Diversity forces have had their 
faces “postered around campus with 
swastikas next to them.” The student 
who was a victim of this was Mr. Drout’s 
friend, the same student involved in the 
disciplinary hearing; and the students 
who put up the posters were not promi­
nent “pro-Diversity” individuals.
Interestingly, anonymous “Diversity 
posters” — posters that went up last 
semester mocking students involved in 
human relations activities on campus — 
also used Nazi symbolism, labelling stu­
dents in CMU Amnesty International as 
“Hitler Youth.” This brings me to Mr. 
Drout’s second form of activity: being 
involved in repressive acts on campus.
When Mr. Drout was asked if he 
thought the “Hitler Youth” label was 
comparable with the swastika label on 
posters mocking his friend, he replied, 
“It’s not the same thing at all.” Why does 
Mr. Drout condemn Nazi posters about 
his friend while condoning the “Hitler 
Youth” Diversity posters? Perhaps the 
following information will help explain: 
•Mr. Drout says, “Keep this [‘re-educa­
tion’] up for a few years and we will have 
a perfectly Diverse campus, everyone 
wearing their identical t-shirts and being 
Diverse together. FACT: the mock “Di­
versity posters” stated, “Don’t forget to 
wear your Diversity t-shirt for marching 
practice.”
•Similarly, Mr. Drout suggests that 
“[t]he student with the most diversity 
points at the end of the semester would 
automatically become student govern­
ment president.” FACT: the mock diver­
sity posters specifically mention student 
government president Mark Mittelhauser 
“appoint[ing] some more committees” at 
a “Diversity Rally.”
•Mr. Drout likens students involved in 
human relations to “storm troopers.” 
FACT: the mock “Diversity posters” label 
students in CMU Amnesty International 
as “Hitler Youth.”
•FACT: the morning after a group of 
the “Diversity posters” went up, Mr. Drout 
and another student were seen outside of 
Doherty Hall holding some of the posters, 
and were heard talking about having
“just finished putting them up this morn­
ing.” When Mr. Drout and his cohort 
noticed they were being watched (from, 
the benches in front of the clock), they 
hushed each other up and quickly walked 
away with their heads down.
•Last October, 1,000 copies of the Stu- 
dent Union were stolen from Baker Hall 
within hours of being delivered to the 
campus. When the matter was brought 
up in a class I had with him, Mr. Drout 
told me (and one other Student Union 
reporter) that the papers had been thrown 
over a nearby bridge; we asked Mr. Drout 
who had given him the information, and 
Mr. Drout stammered and nervously^ 
replied that other Student Union staff 
members had told him. This was an out- 
and-out lie. To this day, no one knows 
how Mr. Drout got this information.
Mr. Drout states “If people espouse an 
opinion that some of us find objection­
able, we have a moral duty to argue 
against them, prove them wrong if pos­
sible, make them look ridiculous if we 
can ....”1 have attempted to fulfill what I 
see as my moral duty to shine a more re­
vealing light on Mr. Drout than he has 
shined upon himself. If I have made any 
erroneous accusations, I apologize to Mr. 
Drout in advance, but I think the above 
facts speak for themselves.
Mr. Drout thinks the administration 
and certain students are out to get every­
one; yet the only human relations events 
that have occurred have been a few 
workshops and dinners (all optional, as 
is any campus event), and one human 
relations honors seminar (no more man­
datory than any elective course). Thus, I 
would submit that the CMU “Diversity 
movement,” is much less threatening 
than Mr. Drout is paranoid.
I hope the next time “Diversity” post­
ers go up, the fence gets whitewashed, 
newspapers get stolen, or “faggot” is 
scrawled across student office doors in 
Skibo, CMU will be able to engage in 
meaningful, accurate dialogue about it.
Put up or shut up, Mike.

Tetris addiction can be deadly
Lunch is a fairly early endeavor 
in D.C. By 2:30 pm the Old Post 
Office is empty of most .of the 
heavy lawyers and administra­
tors that give D.C. its “flavor,” a 
euphemism for a sense that some­
thing is always going on in the 
shadows. If it is any time after 
1:30 pm, you will end up eating 
with secretaries, kids who are 
skipping school, and the odd tour­
ist.
I had been lunching with “people 
of power” since noon. The law- 
yersihad come and gone, leaving 
us and our conversation. I had set 
up this meeting weeks ago 
through my uncle, who is also a 
lawyer. He is well-known in this 
town — he can get people to lis­
ten, and they heed his advice. 
This meeting was a combination 
of my curiosity and his influence.
We were talking about subjects 
of importance, things that had 
been on my mind, things that 
needed confirmation by people in 
high places. We started with the 
more obvious topics, but, by 2:30, 
we were talking about whatever 
came into our minds. I had long 
ceased to take notes.
Even in this rather relaxed 
atmosphere, I couldtell they were 
holding back — until one of them
Don Pickett
slipped.
“What did you say?”
“What, oh, it’s nothing impor­
tant. Just something you said 
caught my interest for a min­
ute....”
“That’s not what you said. You 
said the NSA is looking into it — 
that’s more than catching your 
eye. The NSA are the original 
Bad Boys — they don’t investi­
gate something just because it 
catches your eye.”
“Nonsense. I merely brought it 
to their attention. Case closed.” 
“I don’t believe you. You said 
something about NORAD, 
screens, dangerously wasted 
time.... My god, I see it — it’s 
Tetris.”
‘Yes, dammit, yes, it’s Tetris. 
We ran a standard nuclear as­
sault drill yesterday—there was 
no warning from NORAD until 
the warheads were literally right 
overhead. All the operators had 
that damn game loaded on their 
scopes, and not one of them 
thought that the beeping from
their instruments was more im­
portant than placing a piece on 
level nine. We could’ve been wiped 
out.”
The man to her left spoke up. 
He had been silent throughout 
her soliloquy, judging the dam­
age, seeing what slipped out. He 
was from a different department 
than she, and, by the look on his 
face, seemed satisfied that she 
had slipped up so much. Heads 
would roll.
‘The program itself is amazing. 
We got a copy of the real source 
code, not the stuff Spectrum Holo- 
byte had. It is a hundred years 
ahead of its time. The game is 
fully sentient, responding to the 
emotions. It is designed to keep 
the player enthralled for hours on 
end. It always screws you up, but 
keeps the dream alive that with 
just one more game, you could 
have made it.
‘The programmer Was an abso­
lute genius — on the same level 
with Newton, Beethoven, and the 
guy who invented the little dia­
grams that tell you how to insert 
the batteries in your discman. 
The whole program revolves 
around one concept — Yelsetsifn
— which translates roughly into 
“piss ’em off.” We’re lucky the
Soviets lacked the computer tech­
nology to make use of this theo­
retical breakthrough. They re­
leased it a few years ago. We 
caught it just in time before it got 
worse.
“We’ve taken emergency meas­
ures — we erased every copy of 
Tetris from all our computers, and 
had some of our hackers hardcode 
a trap that will not allow the 
program to run. We’ve set up 
counselling centers at all our 
major bases. This program is an 
addiction, worse than any drug. 
It could have been really bad.”
The meeting broke up around 
3:30 that afternoon. A large gen­
tlemen in a pinstripe suit ap­
proached our table and motioned 
to two of the people. They left, 
mirrored sunglasses flashing in 
the sunlight.
I was left alone with the check, 
wondering who else might be 
exposed to this terrible addiction. 
This might turn out to be very 
serious, indeed.
Don Pickett is a freshman crea­
tive writing major, now at the 
Betty Ford Clinic for his Tetris 
addiction. He is feeling much 
better, and can now have visitors 
in the special rubber room.

The cold war may be over, but the fighting still goes on
Over the past several weeks, 
the United States and the Soviet 
Union have been discussing 
sizeable cutbacks in military 
forces, primarily in Europe. Re­
cently, when Secretary of State 
James Baker visited Czechoslo­
vakia and the Soviet Union, both 
the Soviets and Americans agreed 
to cutbacks in troop size from 
their current level of 560,000 
troops to 305,000, to 195,000.
All in all, these cutbacks are 
fine and, as I have mentioned in 
the past, should be done cau­
tiously and prudently.
But aren’t we forgetting some­
thing?
One thing that should not be
________________________David Schwartz
forgotten is the fact that the 
United States and the Soviet 
Union, along with NATO and 
Warsaw Pact nations, are not the 
only nations possessing nuclear 
capabilities, or, for that matter, 
the desire to attain nuclear capa­
bilities. Lest we forget, nations 
such as China, Iran, Iraq, Libya 
and other countries with less- 
than-stable governments have 
been moving towards achieving a 
viable and effective nuclear arse­
nal as well.
In essence, as the U.S. and 
Soviets discuss peace initiatives 
and cutbacks, other nations with 
records of instability and callous 
regard for human life (e.g. the 
prolonged ten-year war between 
Iran and Iraq) are oblivious to 
any reductions in the military 
establishment themselves.
It is true at this point, with the 
exception of China, that the na- 
tions mentioned have not 
achieved nuclear capabilities, and 
for several reasons. One is that 
Israel destroyed the Iraqi nu­
clear power facility in the early 
’80s. Luckily, other attempts at 
nuclear weapons proliferation
have not and hopefully will not be 
achieved.
But there is another facet to the 
problem — Libya, Iran, and Iraq 
have all achieved chemical capa­
bilities. During the Iran-Iraq war, 
it was seen that Iran and Iraq did 
not think twice about using tox­
ins and other chemical weapons. 
Libya has tried to pursue chemi­
cal weaponry for a while now, 
and there is evidence that they 
may have actually achieved 
chemical weapon status despite 
the hard evidence that was pre­
sented to U.N. by U.S. intelli­
gence.
To further compound the prob­
lem, it has been found that na­
CMU needs a playground for stress relief
“I hate frowning all the time,” a 
friend of mine said today. 'This 
place is getting to be such a drag. 
I need something simple and fun 
to make me smile.”
The pre-midsemester crunch is 
just beginning, and sentiments 
like my friend’s are rampant on 
campus. Walking to class yester­
day, everyone I saw was frown­
ing, and everyone I talked to was 
complaining about something: the 
weather, classes, roommates, and 
campus food. Carnegie Mellon 
students need something to take 
their minds .off these irritations. 
We need to relax more, take our 
extra bits and pieces of time and 
apply them to good old fun. We 
need a playground.
That’s right, a playground. For 
a miniscule fraction of the money 
to be spent on the University 
Center, for less than the cost of a 
Diversity course, for the price of a 
few computers, the University 
could build a iiice little playground 
right next to the fence. It would

Michael Drout
probably do more good in terms of 
stress relief than fifty discussion 
groups and stress-management 
seminars.
A jungle gym, a slide, and a 
bunch of swings, right in front of 
Doherty Hall, the social center of 
campus, would enable students 
to unwind for a few minutes be­
tween classes. It would help blow 
off steam to climb, swing, or slide, 
and just the sight of other college- 
age students playing in a play­
ground would be the biggest stress 
relief I can imagine.
I don’t suggest a giant, high- 
tech playground. Let’s leave the 
grass and trees alone, not touch 
the fence. Build the jungle gym 
out of natural wood that would 
seem at home on the cut. Make 
the swings big enough for three or
four people per seat.
These are just my ideas. Why 
doesn’t Student Senate, instead 
of trying to single-handedly make 
all of us be Diverse, do something 
practical and put up a few hundred 
dollars as a jprize for the best 
design? I’ll bet some architecture 
students could come up with 
something ten times better than 
anything I can think up.
If the University would spring 
for just the supplies, I’m sure 
enough students could be rounded 
up to serve as the labor. Building 
this playground would only take 
a fraction of the effort involved in 
one of the serious Spring Carni­
val Booths, and it would be a 
permanent part of campus. All 
those who helped work on it could 
have their names engraved on a 
brass plaque.
Think of all the publicity such a 
project could generate. It would 
probably get CMU’s name in USA 
Today, and in a much better con­
text than Diskette Day. For a
Panama invasion was not handled well
While I was home over Christ­
mas break, I watched a lot of 
television. I stayed up late and 
bummed around, flippingthrough 
cable stations. Since I had been 
out of world events for a semes­
ter, I decided to hit CNN to catch 
up on wKat was going on. It was 
about 4 am, and I was getting 
groggy. So, of course I thought I 
was hearing things when the 
newscaster started talking about 
Panama being invaded.
Well, I just wanted to talk about 
this Panama thing, as it still 
seems ito be a topic. I personally 
don’t think Bush handled the 
situation well at all, and I think 
the motives for the invasion were 
pure bull.
Noriega was the largest black 
spot on the Bush Administration, 
and a personal black spot on Bush. 
He effectively humiliated Bush
Rich Robinson
worldwide, from their relation­
ship in the CIA to declaring war 
on the United States.
Bush could not let this happen 
anymore. Opinion polls were 
sagging and he had to act to get 
them .up. That’s politics for you.
Well, the polls dropped when. 
Bush screwed up one chance to 
get Noriega, but he acted too 
slowly during a coup attempt. As 
usual, he didn’t want to act hast­
ily. He was probably hunting 
during the attempt. If he had 
acted, the U.S. would have gotten 
Noriega, as well as helped power 
change hands withoutlookinglike 
the bad guy.
Now, the U.S. is on the ropes in 
Latin America for once again 
acting like Big Brother. For those 
of you who don’t realize it, Latin 
American countries don’t espe­
cially like the U.S. I don’t blame 
you for not knowing, though.
I learned about the problems in 
Modern Latin America, a rather 
informative history elective 
course here. But adverse reac­
tions to Panama have been cov­
ered up a lot. I found out that 
Peru cancelled a major drug 
summit with Bush. That summit 
would have been before the one 
last week in Colombia. It also 
would have been a major step in 
stemming cocaine traffic — the 
majority of which goes through 
Peru. I read all of this in a na­
tional newspaper on page 22, in a 
small section of copy.
I support the fact that Noriega
had to be removed. However, the 
method used was questionable. 
Why didn’t Bush act earlier? Why 
did he opt for a flashy, news-gath- 
ering, destructive invasion? If he 
was trying not to be too hasty, 
why didn’t he use a better plan?
To me, the invasion looks sim­
ply like a move to gain face. Bush 
needed better opinion polls. Also, 
he had to get rid of the “wimp” 
image. I don’t support such an 
action. I believe a better option 
could have been available. I think 
that Bush could have come up 
with a better plan. But hey, poli­
tics are politics. I’m going to go for 
the money instead.
I am not politically affiliated. I 
am not conservative or liberal. So 
don’t go accusing me of anything.
Rich Robinson is a sophomore 
IM major.
tions such as Libya, Iran, and 
Iraq, as well as other chemical 
weapon seeking nations and 
groups are able to develop a sys­
tem by which chemical weapons 
can be propelled via missile- 
launched systems.
Scary, huh?
Now, is it really necessary to 
worry about nations such as Iran 
and Iraq attaining weapons of 
higher caliber? Most definitely, 
the answer is yes. It has been 
seen that China was both willing 
and able to service the needs of 
Iran for medium range nuclear 
missiles. Almost immediately, 
Brent Scowcroft was sent on a 
controversial visit to China to
allay their desire to sell weapons 
to Iran.
At this point, I believe that you 
can see something to which I may 
be alluding — SDI. Yes, I strongly 
believe that we must pursue some 
type of space-based and terrain- 
based defense system to protect 
ourselves against this visible 
threat.
Again, let me say that the cut­
backs in weapons and troops 
being proposed are fantastic and 
hopefully the proposals will see 
the light of day, but let us not 
forget who else has the bomb.

pittance, Carnegie Mellon could 
quickly demonstrate that it is 
attempting to improve the “qual­
ity of life” for its students. And 
the presence of the playground 
might do a lot to lighten up the 
tense and oppressed attitude that 
the students here seem to develop.
I’m really serious about this 
idea. I can’t think of a single bet­
ter use for the money the play­
ground would cost. Think about 
how many people sit in the sun on 
the benches in front of Doherty 
and just socialize. The context of 
a playground would make this an 
even bigger social area, bringing 
some much-needed unity to our 
campus. Besides, it would truly 
be an uplifting sight to see CMU 
students laughing and smiling, 
swinging on swings, climbing on 
a jungle gym, and just having a 
good time.

calated into a drippy nose and 
throat, which in turn began a 
little cough.
By the next week, the cough 
had led to a royal sore throat. 
This was when I got tough. I 
began to drink gallons of or­
ange juice and pop vitamin pills 
like a junkie. I took the liberty 
of sleeping through a few Tues­
days and maybe one or two Mon­
days or Thursdays just to be 
sure. This dog wasn’t going to 
put up with some evil virus 
(that’s a biological virus — re­
lax) ravaging my poor cells. For 
a Friday, Saturday, and Sun­
day I felt great!
Then on Monday I woke with 
a fever. “FOCK! I Hate Being 
Sick!” I blew off classes and 
gave up hangovers and got 
myself really healthy. Being 
sick for two weeks straight is 
not my idea of fun. I was tired, 
I was grumpy, I was depressed,
— technically, it sucked.
I went to the grocery store 
with my roommate to buy gro­
ceries (go figure!?) and I bought 
$15 worth ofvariousmedicines. 
I bought Tylenol Cold Medi­
cine, Nyquil, and Robitussin 
Cough Syrup. I was armed and 
ready to do battle. Upon re­
turning from the Food Gallery, 
I was so exhausted by the expe­
rience that I promptly went to 
bed, at 6 pm. I woke at 10 pm, 
did three differential equations 
and went to bed, woke at 7 am, 
was too tired to get out of bed, 
and slept until 2 pm. I got out of 
bed, took a very hot shower, felt 
great, and declared myself 
happy and healthy and settled 
down with all of the homework 
I had missed. I was a happy 
camper.
For a few days, I continued to 
feel good, except I had a teeny- 
weeny sore throat, and occa­
sionally I coughed, and had a 
tiny fever ... but I felt great.
Like the incoming tide, it crept 
back up. Soon, I slept through 
most of my classes, came home 
exhausted after the ordeal of 
sleeping through classes, and 
slept. Ok, it’s time to go to health 
services. I had this crazy feeling 
that maybe I had more than 
just influenza.
“Let’s see, swollen glands, no 
fever, coughing, and sore throat, 
you only have a virus. I could do 
a throat culture, but you proba­
bly don’t have strep throat.”
Typical run-around.
Two days later I woke at 6:30 
for my physics exam. Someone 
was rubbing a rusty wire brush 
in the back of my throat. I 
couldn’t swallow water. Peeved 
I was.
After I finished a hell day of 
Chloraseptic spray and various 
drugs, I returned to Student 
Health.
“Oh, you’ve been tired, and 
you’re running a bit of a fever, 
Oh! have you been very tired? I 
better check you for strep throat 
and Mononucleosis.”
Brilliant.
So, to make a long story short, 
after three days of Penicillin, I 
love life.
Next time I return to CMU 
from winter vacation,- I hope 
someone will have moved it to 
Arizona. In fact, my second 
choice to CMU was ASU, to be a 
tanning major.

Criminals now have to do tough time
It’s been a tough time for people 
involved with Irangate. General 
Richard Secord was sentenced to 
two years’ probation for his role 
as one of the architects of the 
famous arms plot.
Most people were shaken by the 
harsh sentence. The next one was 
even tougher. Albert Hakim, 
another conspirator, was given 
two years’ probation and a fine of 
$5,000. He was punished further 
by being told that the only money 
he could keep from the plot was 
the $1.7 million he had deposited 
in Switzerland.
“Why the cruel and unusual 
punishment?” civil libertarians 
wanted to know.
‘..“We are trying to teach a lesson 
to everyone who flouts the law,” 
tSe Lord High Chief Plea-Bar- 
gainer in the Justice Department 
informed me. “When people see 
what Ollie North, Secord, and 
Hakim got, they will think twice 
about diddling with the law of the 
land.”
“Be honest. Didn’t you roll over
/ktArt Buchwald
and make a deal with Secord and 
Hakim so that they would testify 
against Poindexter? Isn’t he the 
last link in the chain that leads 
straight to the Oval Office?”
“If we had made a deal with 
both of them, why would we insist 
on such harsh probation? The 
Justice Department doesn’t make 
deals with people who plead guilty 
to high crimes and misdemean­
ors.”
“The rumor on the street is that 
you’re always willing to make 
deals—no matter what the felon 
does. There is a story out that you 
will drop charges against Nori­
ega if he turns state’s evidence 
and testifies against Fidel Castro 
and Daniel Ortega.”
“There is no truth to that at all,” 
he assured me. “We do not plea- 
bargain with prisoners of war.
Noriega will be given all his rights 
according to the Geneva Conven­
tion, where, incidentally, he has 
all his money. He will then re­
ceive the sentence he is entitled 
to, depending on his name, rank, 
and serial number.”
“I believe you,” I said. “Suppose 
Noriega ratted on Imelda Mar­
cos, would that get him tickets to 
the Super Bowl?”
“We only make deals if a person 
can lead us to other people. Now, 
if Noriega wanted to tell us what 
he knew about Leona Helmsley, 
we might start talking about 
putting him in a minimum-secu- 
rity lockup. But he’s going to have 
to give us more than her old 1RS 
1040 returns. It’ll be hard for 
Noriega to plea-bargain with us 
when we’ve told the whole world 
that he’s Mr. Big.”
“Suppose Noriega demands that 
every American secret be pro­
duced at his trial? Will you plea- 
bargain with him just to shut him 
up?”
“We will never be reasonable
with anyone who puts the govern­
ment in an embarrassing posi­
tion. The Justice Department 
must prosecute those who resort 
to lawless behavior, whether they 
take money from the Iranians, 
the Contras, or a savings and loan 
bank in Albuquerque. If we’re 
going to be tough on North, Sec­
ord, and Hakim, then we have to 
be just as tough on Noriega. After 
all, we started a war to get him.” 
“Speaking of war,” I said, “has 
it ever occurred to you that since 
Noriega is a prisoner of war, he is 
entitled to a ticker-tape parade?” 
“He’s not going to get one. We 
didn’t give one to North or Secord 
or Hakim, and Poindexter won’t 
get one either, even if he blows 
the whistle on Ronald Reagan.” 
“Why not?”
“Because ticker tapes could give 
people the wrong idea when it 
comes to violating the law.”

Ice Tartans leave behind 
playoff hopes to SRU
By MARK ROBSON
Tartan Staffwriter
For the first time since the 
league’s inception in 1972, the 
CMU hockey team has failed to 
make the West Penn College 
Hockey Association playoffs.
The Tartans lost to Penn 
State West 8—2 on Saturday 
and then to Slippery Rock 6-3 
on Sunday. CMU and Slippery 
Rock finished regular' season 
play with identical 4-8-0 rec­
ords, but Slippery Rock will 
advance to the playoffs as they 
beat CMU twice this season.
The Tartans’ loss on Sunday 
clinched their loss of playoff
hopes.
With its added importance, 
Sunday’s game had all the in­
tensity of playoff hockey. The 
Tartans were fired up for the 
start of the game, despite miss­
ing six of their better players. 
Added to the absentee list that 
already included four wounded 
Ice Tartans was sophomore 
center Ed Kilduff, who was 
suspended for fightimg 
inSaturday’s game, and grad 
student defenseman Ed Pike, 
who was away on business.
The 6-3 score was not repre­
sentative of the Tartans’ play.

SPORTSPEAK
by Josh Ruben
fhere’s more to 
¡t than dribbling
i Versatility is a quality seldom 
appreciated by people who 
Iwatch or play a certain sport.
! Babe Ruth, for example, will 
always be remembered as a 
great baseball player. But, ask 
almost anyone on the street 
what Ruth did that made him 
so great and they will tell you 
that he was a great hitter. This 
may be true, but Ruth was also 
a fantastic pitcher when he first 
started playing pro ball with the 
Boston Red Sox. The Yankees 
gaw him.as a hitting threat ¿nd 
took him off of the mound 
ibecause “pitchers don’t hit.”
! The purpose this week, o’ 
igentle reader, is not to decry the 
savage crucifixion of baseball 
brought on by the designated 
hitter. The example of Babe 
Ruth only illustrates what 
happens when people ignore or 
refuse to capitalize on an 
athlete’s versatility. Had he 
remained a pitcher who could 
clobber home runs, he could 
have forever reshaped his own 
destiny as well as the game of 
baseball. Tragic, ain’t it.
But today, we’re gonna talk 
basketball.
The game itself is versatile.
All one needs is a ball, a hoop, 
and, contrary to popular opin­
ion, a pair of $25 sneakers. No 
sandlots or cow pastures, 
helmets, or ice skates are 
required.
;; Even the uniforms for organ­
ized play are simple and easy to 
acquire. All Jordan, Magic, and 
Wilkins are wearing, by God, is 
their underwear.
The mere fact that two to as 
many as ten people can play is 
the true indication of the game’s 
versatility.
When Dr. Naismith invented 
the game, he did so out of a 
need for a “team” sport; a sport 
a group of boys could play when 
the snow outside of the YMCA 
got too deep. Therefore, the 
game will always be intrinsi­
cally oriented for team play.
¦ Unfortunately, this is not the 
way the game is being played 
here at Carnegie Mellon. At 
least not by the men’s varsity 
team. The Tartans are simply 
playing horrendously. After 
watching the game against 
Grove City last week, I think I 
know why.
Coach Larry Anderson is not 
coaching his team, nor even in­
structing his players, to func­
tion as a five-man unit. Rather, 
the team plays like five indi­
viduals trying to play five 
separate games of one-on-one.
The most threatening basket­
ball teams pass. But, in order to 
pass effectively, the players on 
the court must have a connec­
tion between them — a rhythm 
which allows them to communi­
cate with one another to set up 
plays.
Anderson needs to take his 
players and make them break 
their habit of school-yard bas­
ketball. While this style of play 
niay be fun to watch and can 
i even put some points on the 
board, it is not the way for a 
structured, college basketball 
j team to play, 
i ; Versatility allows a good 
shooter to be a good passer. The 
Tartans are simply not versa- 
tUe. They must be taught that a 
¡j point guard can set a pick and 
that a forward can grab for a 
rebound. Anderson needs to 
take a lesson from the Yankees.

Women extend lead in PAC; hopes for UAA
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The Tartans’ University Ath­
letic Association season came to a 
close on Sunday with a 64—56 
victory over Brandeis University. 
The victory gave the Tartans a 
final record of 8-6 in the UAA as 
well as a 15-9 overall mark.
In the season opener, the Tar­
tans crushed the Judges by a score 
of 65-46, and the opening min­
utes seemed to suggest that an 
even worse beating was in store. 
The Tartans dominated the first
five minutes, holding the Judges 
to just one point, and extended 
their lead to nine points at the 
halfway mark.
However, the Judges began to 
get stronger and climb back into 
the game over the next five min­
utes. An eight-point run by the 
Judges brought them within two 
points, 14^-12, and a second run of 
ten points put Brandeis ahead 
24-18 with only two minutes left 
in the half. The Tartans managed 
to shave a few points off of the 
Brandeis lead, but went into 
halftime trailing 27-24.
“We were playing tired,” ex­
plained Head Coach Gerri Seidl. 
“We’d been playing every other 
day, and we hadn’t had an easy 
game for the past two weeks.” 
“They played a lot better as a 
team this time,” added senior co­
captain Lisa Smith.
The Judges scored the first 
points of the second half, but the 
Tartans responded by blowing the 
game wide open. The Tartan de­
fense held Brandeis scoreless for 
almost six minutes as the offense 
scored 15 straight points for a 
39-29 lead.
“We controlled the game a lot 
better in the second half,” said 
sophomore Heather O’Donnell, 
“and we got to run a lot more.” 
The game took on a more even 
tone after the Tartans’ run. The 
teams matched score for score over 
the next several minutes with the 
Tartans’ foul shooting providing 
all the advantage they needed. 
CMU turned in a strong 22-for-29 
performance from the charity 
stripe, including an incredible 13 
for 14 by Smith, whose only miss 
came on her last attempt of the 
day. Smith would lead all scorers
look dim i
with 19 points.
Down the stretch, the Judges 
got a little more offensive sup,-! 
port, but were unable to catch the... 
Tartans. Brandeis sophomore,, 
Rachael Perry scored eight of her - 
team-high 17 points in the final 
six minutes but got little help 
from her teammates, and Carne-!: 
gie Mellon came away with the 
64—56 win.

tans played their last road game

The professor arrives, his pres­
ence filling the classroom. You 
and the rest of the graduate stu­
dents are intimidated by the aura 
this man emanates. There were 
two professors that taught this 
class, and you got the one that 
nobody wanted to get. Of course.
He picks up the chalk and be­
gins scribbling on the board at an 
amazing rate. Throughout the 
entire class you are behind on the 
notes, and never grasp whatever 
concept it is that he is teaching. 
By the end of the class, you are in­
wardly fuming, as you are certain 
that you were cursed with the 
most malicious and insincere 
professor on earth. If only you 
had a chance to show him your 
anger. If only you could get him 
back....
Evil thoughts race through your 
mind on your way to the gym for 
your IM volleyball game that af­
ternoon. You put your clothes on, 
and head out to the gym, and wait 
with your teammates for the mem­
bers of the other team to get there. 
And they do.

You can’t believe it. It’s him — 
your professor — in Nikes and 
gym shorts? No. Wait — is this 
faculty-grad volleyball I signed 
up for? Yes, you tell yourself, and 
better yet, it’s your dream real­
ized. A brief picture of you slam­
ming the volleyball down his 
throat makes you chuckle out 
loud. The'whistle blows, you join 
the front line of your team, and go 
face to face with your professor....
Faulty-grad volleyball, al­
though hopefully not a vicious 
battlefield for grad students and 
faculty staff, is indeed a good time 
for a change of pace for the stu­
dents and professors, and an 
outlet for some tension that can 
build up in the classroom. The
CMU Intramural Departments 
offers faculty-grad volleyball inr 
the spring season.
In its second year, the idea o£ 
faculty-grad volleyball was con'— 
ceived last year by Alan Chris­
tiansen, a grad student in com­
puter science.
According to Cindy Bryce, this > 
year’s commissioner and a gradu- i 
ate student in Urban and Public 
Affairs, Christiansen went to the 
Graduate Students Organization,

The men’s basketball team is limping toward its worst 
season in 17 years. Losses against Grove City, Thiel, and 
Brandeis dropped the Tartans’ record to 3-19. If the team 
loses its last three games, it will be Carnegie Mellon’s worst 
season since it went 1—22 in 1973.
“The only thing left is beating Washington and Jeffer­
son,” said Head Coach Larry Anderson. The Presidents are 
tied for first place in the Presidents’ Athletic Conference 
with Thiel and need to beat the Tartans for a shot at the 
title.
With the team now sporting a six-game losing streak, the 
prospect of beating the conference leader, though seems 
remote. Carnegie Mellon’s porous defense gave up 100 
points for the fourth time this season, with Brandeis 
scoring 106.

ST. LOUIS — Carnegie Mellon’s 
men’s and women’s swim teams 
finished in the fourth and sev­
enth place, respectively, in the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) championships held Wed­
nesday through Saturday here at 
Washington University.
Individually, however, Coach 
Bruce Bronsdon was suprisedthat 
his teams swam so well. “They 
just performed beyond my expec­
tations,” he said.
Many personal best were ob­
tained throughout the champion­
ships, as ten to 12 school records 
were set and three people quali­
fied'for the National champion-
sips.
Sophomore Jo Wollschaelger 
quailified for nationals in the 200 
individual medley and the 200 
butterfly and grad student Franc­
esca Crannell qualified in the 100 
freestyle. Sophomore Brian Zim­
merman will go to Nationals in 
three events: 200, 500 and 1,650 
freestyle.
Sophomore Glynis Frost set 
school records in the 500,100 and 
1650 freestyle. Senior Pat Hen- 
sler, co-captain of the men’s team, 
set a school record in the 200 indi­
vidual medley.
The women’s 800 freestyle re­
lay, 400 freestyle relay, 400 med­
ley and 200 medley relays all set 
school records.
Sophomore Missy Van Royen
attributes much of the team’s im-, 
provement to new coach 
Bronsdon, saying, “We work well ; 
together.... [The team is] more ; 
supportive, outgoing, and more ; 
united as a team.... The new coach ! 
is great.”
Both Blue Jay squads of Johns ! 
Hopkins perched themselves atop ’ 
the UAA competition.
While the men dominated ¦ 
throughout, the Hopkins women • 
won in a more exciting style, ; 
winning by only 24 points, as ; 
opposed to the men’s 238-point:; 
lead over the second-place fin- ! 
isher, Emory; Rochester was third ! 
for the men.
On the women’s side, Roches­
ter snagged second place and

Lemieux streak ends. Mario Lemieux’s bid to 
break Wayne Gretzky’s record streak of 51 consecu- 
; tive games with at least one point ended Wednes­
day night when the Penguins’ captain failed to total 
j a point against the Rangers.

• the first two peri­
ods and left the 
game.
Penguins man- 
: agement is reluc­
tant to comment, 
but there has been 
much speculation 
' that Lemieux will 
be out for the rest
of the season. A Penguins spokesman did not rule 
this out, but he said that team trainers and physi- 
•' cians will first attempt physical therapy and pain 
killers.
Only if it is apparent that Mario will not be able 
to play the rest of the season will he go in for sur­
gery. There has already been speculation that the 
, back trouble could be severe enough to be career- 
. ending. Lemieux’s injury casts doubts on the re- 
,1 mainder of the Pens’ season.
Although winning their last four games, and only 
five points behind the first-place Islanders, they 
¦are also only five points ahead of the last place 
Flyers. Without their captain and leading scorer, 
many observers are writing off this season for 
Pittsburgh.

the wretchedness of Quebec as to their own league-

off berth last week. Were the Bruins to lose all the

the same as baseball. The bases 
are marked off by points at the 
edge of the pool, but there is no 
pitcher. The batter stands at the 
edge of the pool and knocks the 
ball into the playing “field” as he 
would serve a volleyball. He then 
dives into the water and heads for 
first base.
Double water ball originated in 
Pittsburgh, and is considered the 
only “true” water game, as it 
cannot really be played on land. 
Two balls are used, with each 
side starting with one.
The object of the game is to 
protect your ball from the oppos­
ing team while trying to take 
theirs away. Zones should be five
feet away from each pool wall, 
and a full game consists of three 
periods of four minutes each.
When both balls are in posses­
sion of any one member of a team, 
that player has to touch them to­
gether to score a point.
Water dodge ball is played with 
two inflated balls. One team is in 
the pool, the otherteam is outside 
it, and the object is for the outside 
team to hit as many of the inside 
players with the balls.
The sides change after five min­
utes, when a score is taken —- 
each person hit is worth a point. 
The team with the most points 
wins.
None of these games really -
requires more than a pool, a ball 
and a few swimming skills, which 
makes them perfect for a group of 
college students to play. The CMU 
pool in the Thistle Gym has regu. 
lar hours for open recreation for 
students and faculty, andis meant 
exactly for those times when an 
outdoor activity isn’t possible.
So next time your snow football 
game has to be cancelled because 
everyone is wearing shorts, try 
reserving the pool for one of these 
games. It just might be a fun way. 
to pass the time until April and 
break the winter blahs.

firmed that he does not want to leave the team.
The Russian really has very little choice. He 
faces a five year sentence of hard labor for his defec­
tion from the Soviet army. Mogilny traveled by 
train to two of the Sabres games this week, but it is 
unlikely that he will be able to continue to be a 
regular player without conquering his fear. Inter­
estingly enough, Wayne Gretzky admitted a fear of 
flying a few years ago.
Kings in Trouble.
Even after their block­
buster trade of Bemie 
Nicholls for Tony 
Granato and Tomas 
Sandstrom, the L.A. 
Kings continue to lose. 
As of writing time they 
were five points behind 
third-place Winnipeg 
and only nine ahead of 
cellar-dwellingVancou-
Bruce McN all has apparently been trying to make 
another blockbuster trade, but word is that Edmon­
ton has refused every offer that has been made for 
Jari Kurri. Other speculation hinges on Luc Robi- 
taille being traded to the Penguins in a straight 
swap for Paul Coffey.
The Pittsburgh Penguins may be willing to make 
the trade if it turns out that Mario Lemieux is out 
for the season, as they will desperately need a big 
center.
New League to Form. In the wake of the NHL’s 
announcement of a $50-million entry fee for a new 
franchise, there has been much talk of a league 
forming to challenge the NHL.
Wordis that the new league will play with slightly 
different rules: no red line, no fighting, larger rinks, 
and possibly a penalty-shot shootout to end tie 
games.
To gain credibility, the league is expected to bid 
rest of their games, they would still make the play- heavily for future star Eric Lindros and attempt to
pick up league leading goal-scorer Brett Hull. There 
is talk of franchises in Europe, though how teams 
will manage travel expenses has not been dis­
closed.
Whether this league will actually challenge the 
National Hockey League or if it will simply be ab­
sorbed as the old WHL was, will be a hot topic for 
the ’90s.

presidents’ Athletic Conference 
record to 5—1 and guaranteed it at 
least a tie for the conference cham­
pionship. Thiel, the only other 
team in contention, already has 
three conference losses, which 
means that either a Tartan win or 
a Lady Cat loss will leave the 
Tartans alone at the top.
“When you take a team from 
the bottom of the conference a 
couple of years ago, and rise to the 
position of repeating as champi­
ons, it’s really a good feeling, “ 
commented Seidl. “Winning any 
conference is a major achievement
because it’s reaching a goal we set 
for ourselves back at the begin­
ning of the year.”
The game against Thiel followed 
a pattern similar to that of the 
Brandeis game. CMU owned the 
first ten minutes of the game, 
grabbing a 17-4 lead after 11 
minutes of action. The Tartans 
seemed to be in control of the 
game until foul trouble came into 
play. Seven Carnegie Mellon fouls 
in a three-minute span opened 
the door for the Lady Cats to chip 
away at the 13-point Tartan lead. 
Fortunately, Thiel wasn’t up to 
the challenge, and the half ended
with Carnegie Mellon holding a 
36—26 lead.
Early in the second half, Thiel 
went on a seven-point run, keyed 
by senior Julie Sierota. Sierota, 
who had 23 points when the teams 
met earlier in the year, hit a pair 
of baskets to cut the Tartan lead 
to three points, but was ineffec­
tive for the rest of the game as her 
4 for 19 shooting performance in­
dicates.
Carnegie Mellon took a timeout 
to regroup, and proceeded to pull 
away from the Lady Cats. Smith 
and sophomore Katie Fahey, who 
had21 andl4 points, respectively,
led the offense while senior Tricia 
Chorgo cleaned the boards with a 
total of 14 rebounds. The Lady 
Cats’ Lisa Popovich scored 11 of 
her 21 points in the same stretch, 
but the Tartans came into the 
closing minutes with an eight- 
point lead, 58-50.
In the last four minutes, the 
Tartans made sure there was no 
doubt as to who the conference 
champions were. Carnegie Mel­
lon went on an eight-point run 
that pushed its lead to a game- 
high 15 points.
The Lady Cats cut five points 
off of the lead, but a pair of Fahey
free throws and a Chorgo basket 
with four seconds on the clock 
iced the 14-point win.
In the week’s other action, the 
Tartans suffered their only* PAC 
loss of the season at the hands of 
Grove City on Wednesday.
The Tartans stayed close for 
the entire game, but faded late 
and were overcome by the Wol­
verines. Freshman Kelly Sterling 
led the Tartans with 14 points, 
while Fahey and Chorgo each 
added 13 points in the losing ef­
fort.
This week, the Tartans go after 
sole possession of the PAC cham­
pionship with conference games 
against Washington and Jeffer­
son today, and Bfethany on Thurs­
day. Both games will be played at 
Skibo Gym and will begin at 6 pm.
“We’re going to have to press 
hard and play a fast-paced game 
against Washington and Jeffer­
son,” commented coach Seidl. “We 
need to be well-rested, and we 
really have to play aggressiye 
defense.”
“It’s going to be a tough game, 
because they’ll be out to get us,” 
. added Smith, “but as long as we 
play our sort of game, we’re going 
to win it ali."

senior forward Harvey Beckham.
However, with defeat piling upon defeat, some 
players are finding it difficult to make it through 
the final week of the season. “It’s just real hard to 
keep going,” said 
freshman forward 
Brian Moyer.
The Tartans will 
attempt in their 
final games against 
W&J, Bethany, and 
St. Mary’s (Md.) to 
allow some of the 
freshmen to get 
playing time.
Against Brandeis, 
the team sported a
lineup more appropriate for a a junior varsity 
game: freshmen Chris Benec, Brian Lyscik, Matt 
Onaitis, Eric Royster, and Troy Sims.
The week got worse as it went along. ¦
Against the Wolverines, Carnegie Mellon quickly 
fell ten points behind, but used a one-minute stretch 
late in the half to close the gap from eight to one 
points. A revitalized Phil Bronner came off the 
bench to spark the fast break as the Tartans ended 
the half trailing by one, 37-36.
The momentum carried into the beginning of the 
second half. A pair of baskets by freshmen Charlie

Connors and Todd Jenkins followed by a three- 
point bomb by Bronner gave the team its biggest 
lead of the game. However, as has happened so 
many times this season, the team ran out of gas.
After a Grove City timeout, the Wolverines started 
back. Three minutes later the 
game was tied and Grove City 
never trailed again by more 
than two.
A Bronner jump shot gave 
CMU its final lead, 61-59 with 
six minutes remaining. How­
ever, an eight point Grove City 
run put the game out of reach. 
Turnovers and missed shots 
kept the Tartans down as the 
¦¦¦ Wolverines went on to win, 
72-64.
In Greenville, the game was over almost as soon 
as it began. The Tomcats jumped out to a 26-8 lead, 
helpedby 16 CMU first-half turnovers. By halftime, 
Thiel owned a 43—25 lead. The Tartans were play­
ing short-handed; Bronner had been left behind in 
Pittsburgh because he had missed the team bus.
The Tartans tried mounting a comeback in the 
second half. Senior captain Chris Luckett spear­
headed the effort with 30 points but the team fell 
short, losing 84—74.
Then the floodgates opened against Brandeis.

Paul Favours, Steve Harrington, and Mark Pea­
body buried CMU with strong rebounding, a tena­
cious defense, and 68 percent from the three-point 
stripe.
The Tartans held an early 4r-3 lead, their only of 
the game — afterwards it was all Brandeis. After 
CMU closed to within two, the Judges went on an 11 
point run over two minutes to push their lead into 
double figures. As the Tartan offense sputtered, 
Brandeis continued to build its lead to a command­
ing 56-32 at halftime.
The bombing continued in the second half. CMU 
never got within 20 points as the Judges cruised.to 
a 106-70 victory.
This Week: The Tartans close the 1989-90 season 
with three final games at home. Tuesday night PAC 
co-leader W&J comes to town, followed with Thurs­
day against Bethany—the only PAC team the Tar­
tans have beaten this season. The season ends 
Saturday with a non-conference game against St. 
Mary’s College (Md.). Tuesday’s and Thursday’s 
games are at 8 pm, and Saturday’s is at 2 pm.

derson, sophomore Jan-Marc Feath- 
ertson and junior Randy Walter had great 
offensive chances, with each member of 
the line scoring a goal. Walter, Feather- 
ston, and Henderson played with an 
intensity not seen in many games.
Henderson played his best game of the 
semester against Slippery Rock as he 
netted a break-away goal and helped set 
up the other two.
Walter played his best game as a Tar­
tan. “Randy and Jan both played well,” 
said Henderson. “They went to the net 
and took lots of shots. We worked well 
together.” Featherston tipped in a Hason
slapshot in the first period, and in the 
second period Walter stuffed in a Feath­
erston rebound that resulted from a 
Henderson slapshot.
With Featherston being moved up to 
the first line from defense, CMU played 
the whole game with only three defens e- 
men. With a full squad, the Tartans 
would normally dress five or six defense- 
men. Sophomore John Caron, junior 
Denny Frey, and grad student Dick 
Hanson worked hard throughout the 
entire game to compensate for the dis­
crepancies in the defense.
The third line of sophomores James 
Thompson and Adam Duncan, and sen­

ior Adam Dermarderosian also played 
well, but its difficulty in getting the puck 
out of the defensive zone led to three 
SRU goals. Midway through the third 
period, Dermarderosian one-timed a 
Hanson feed in the Rock net. The refe­
ree, being out of position, saw the goalie 
grab the puck as it came off the back of 
the net and ruled that the puck never 
went in.
In Saturday’s action, the Tartans 
skated with Penn State West through
through the first two periods as Carnegie 
Mellon trailed 3-1. Carnegie Mellon’s 
goal came from Henderson, who scoffed 
on a break away late in the second period. 
Penn State West then took control of the 
game and scored five unanswered goSls 
until Thompson popped in a unassisted 
goal.
Based on their performance last se­
mester, the CMU Ice Tartans were .in­
vited to the Belmont Comple College 
Invitational March 10 and 11. Also fea­
tured in this tournament will 'be 
Duquesne, University of Cincinnati, and 
University of Delaware. Carnegie Mel­
lon will play Duquesne on March 8. ,

Robert Morris College hosted 
Carnegie Mellon Sunday, when 
the men’s and women’s indoor 
track teams boasted a string of 
strong finishes, including several 
wins and a broken school record 
for the Tartans.
Junior Todd Balbera bounced 
back from an illness to win the 
men’s 5000- meter race, followed 
by senior Tim Berger. Freshmen 
Scott Phillips, Rich Hayes, and 
Benjamin Keyes ran strong races 
to place third, fourth, and fiflh.
Freshman Frank Desideio’s 
time of 8.16 earned him second 
place in the 55-meter hurdles. 
Freshman Chris Maguire and 
junior Jeff Illian placed third in 6.6, and sixth in 6.8 seconds, re­
spectively, in the men’s 55-meter 
dash.
Seniors Jody Burig and 
Charsetta Grant bettered their 
times from the last meet in the 
women’s 55-meter dash. Burig ran 
a time of 7.85, which gave her
third place in the event.
The women’s team pulled to­
gether to make the 1500-meter 
event an all-around success. 
Sophomore Carolyn Lowe set a 
new school record of 5:00.7, break­
ing the previous record of 5:02.5.
Freshman Laura Sibley set a 
personal record when she ran it 
in 5:10.9, and junior Kristin Bur- 
gard had an excellent time of 
5:14.9. Freshman Tracy Howard 
also ran her best time.
Coach Dario Donatelli felt that 
the men also ran good times in 
the men’s 1500-meter race, where 
senior Dave Supp came in second 
in 4:02.4, and junior Gary Harri­
son followed him in 4:03.1.
Supp went on to win the men’s 
3000-meter race in a time of 8:49. 
He was followed by sophomores 
Jonathon Freider in third place 
and John Byrnes in fourth place, 
running times of 9:13 and 9:13.5.
Lowe took the lead in the 
women’s 3000-meter race, win­
ning the event in 11:03. Sibley fol­
lowed in fourth, setting another 
personal record with her time of
11:09.
For a fourth win of the day for 
the Tartans, senior Len O’Neal 
placed first in the half-mile, which 
he ran in 1:58.1. Senior Sandy 
Payne ran a time of 2:35.1 in the 
half-mile, placing her fourth in 
her heat and seventh overall.
Freshman Sean Pempel set a 
personal record for himself in the 
men’s quarter mile, which he ran 
in 53.2 seconds.
He then broke that in the men’s 
four-by-400 relay, which he ran 
in 52.3 seconds. The team placed 
second in the relay, which also 
included O’Neal, Harrison, and 
Shapiro.
Finally, the women’s four-by- 
400-meter relay team had its best 
performance of this season so far 
when it finished in a time of 4:45. 
The team consisted of Payne, 
Burig, Grant, and freshman Cindy 
Wei.
“The team is looking well,” said 
Donatelli. “There is sickness that’s 
bringing us down, but the one’s 
who are running are doing well, 
and everybody is progressing.”

Intramural volleyball at the time,” 
said Bryce.
According to Bryce, Faculty- 
Grad Volleyball is blessed with a 
good turnout from graduate stu­
dents, faculty and staff members. 
“Last year, we had 21 teams, and 
about 200 people were involved in 
the whole thing,” said Bryce. This 
year exceeds those numbers —
there are now 31 teams and close 
to 250 people total, Bryce esti­
mates.
Recruiting faculty members 
interested in the game can some­
times be difficult. “The word goes 
out to departments, and students 
also seek out faculty members on 
their own,” said Bryce. “Some de­
partments have a bigger turnout 
than others.” She noted that this
year, Physical Plant, GSIA, and 
SUPA especially involved several 
teams.
Any mixture of teams is permit­
ted, said Bryce, and men and 
women, spouses, and faculty or 
staff or students can all be in­
volved on one team.
Faculty-Grad Volleyball games 
are played Sunday nighs in the 
Thistle Gym.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 20 February 1990
/
By CARLOS H. FRANCO
Tartan Contributing Editor
Those of you familiar with Margaret 
Weis and Tracy Hickman, authors of The 
Dragonlance Trilogy, The Twins Trilogy, 
The Darksword Series, and the Rose of 
the Prophets Trilogy, will be a bit sur- 
prisedby their latest book, Dragon Wing.
¦ Dragon Wing has more of a science fic­
tion flavor to it than any of their previous 
books.
This book is set in the imaginary world 
of Arianus, populated by the typical 
fantasy beings: humans, elves, and 
dwarves.
In the past, elves had enslaved the 
humans, but the humans rebelled. A 
long war ensued; the tale is set during 
that war.
The story begins with the attempted 
execution of an assassin — Hugh the 
Hand. Hugh, however, is not executed. 
Instead, he is saved by the King’s wiz­
ard.
Much to Hugh’s disliking, his salva­
tion is not all he imagined it would be. 
Upon saving Hugh, the wizard delivers 
him to King Stephen of the Volkaran 
Isles and the Uylandia Cluster, who 
. makes Hugh a deal he can’t refuse.
Hugh is supposed to kill the King’s 
son, also named.Stephen. It is not a case 
of simple murder; rather, Hugh is to 
make it look like the elves committed the

foul. Hugh begins the journey during 
which he is supposed to kill the boy. The 
whole story involves the trip and the 
people Hugh and Stephen encounter 
during their exploits. They meet mem­
bers of two god-like races, elves and 
dwarves, who call themselves Gegs. Many 
questions are answered and many more 
created.
Some of the questions answered: why 
the King is having his son murdered and 
who the Prince Stephen’s servant really 
is. The questions that are created are too 
numerous to list but the major one is why 
the god-like races are at war and how the 
other characters fit in.
During a review, it is generally ex­
pected for the author of the review to give 
his or her opinion of the book. Well, I 
can’t exactly decide whether or not I 
liked the book.
Since I prefer fantasy to science fic­
tion, I think that this book had a little to 
much of the latter for my tastes. Parts of 
the book were interesting and really en­
grossing, while others were confusing or 
boring.
Anyone who has read any of Weis’ and 
Hickman’s other books will find most of 
the characters in Dragon Wing a little 
distant. Except for Limbeck, who is a 
Geg, all the characters were too sterile, 
but then again, I have always been par­
tial to dwarves.
Another complaint I have is that the 
book skips around too much. Eveiy couple 
of chapters introduces a different char­
acter in a different setting. It gets really 
confusing. I think part of the problem 
that I have with the characters stems 
from all the jumping around; you can’t 
really get a handle on the characters.
All the jumping around before I had a 
grasp of the story made me spend too 
long trying to figure out how all these 
characters fit together. And now that I 
know that their paths are woven to­
gether, I wonder how and why. The join­
ing of the characters seems very con­
trived. I think I would rather read a story 
about each character.
Another problem I have with the book 
is the elf-human war. The reasons given 
seem feeble; so feeble, in fact, I can’t 
really recall them. I guess all the other 
books I have read where the elves have 
been cool guys have somehow prejudiced 
me. Somehow, I just can’t relate to the 
elves being supremists, kind of like the 
Nazis.
The book, however, shows some prom­
ise; for example, I find the story line

involving the god-like races most inter- about these beings,
esting. Still, I don’t think there was Read at your own risk, but if you do,
enough about them in this book. I guess wait for the paperback. The book is defi- 
ITl just have to wait until the next book nitely not worth the $18.95 hardback
comes out before I can find out more price.

On-Campus Jam Session
March 12. 1990
In 1782, in the court of Emperor Joseph II, a brash 
young composer named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 
set the music world on its car. A radical departure 
from the current fashion in music, he set a new stan­
dard for style and composition.
It has always been so. The old guard surpassed by a 
new wave. It’s true today in the area of Integrated 
Circuit Design Automation (ICDA)—software tools 
used in the design and development of ICs and elec­
tronic systems. Cadence broke with the conventional 
order to create the industry’s only completely open 
and integrated ICDA software solution. Our high- 
performance tools are coordinated into one harmo­
nious environment, allowing the user to arrange 
the entire IC design process from design entry to 
final verification.
Our approach to integrating the IC design has made 
Cadence the leader in ICDA software. And now we’re 
building on our expertise in IC design and expanding 
our range to include a full line of products for the 
overall Electronic Design Automation (EDA) market, 
a much broader market than ICDA. We are a financially 
secure, fully resourced company, and we’re growing 
at 80% a year—over three times as fast as the indus­
try average. With the recent merger with Gateway 
Design Automation Corporation, now called our Ad­
vanced Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) Division, 
we are able to challenge the top vendors in the systems 
design software market. And our new Advanced CAE 
Division will continue to market the Verilog logic 
simulation software products, bringing new strength 
to our market penetration efforts in Europe andjapan.

Navy ROTC
The Navy EOTC unit at Carne­
gie Mellon fielded new people and 
new teams in several recent away 
competitions.
Despite the youth of the Navy 
EOTC Rifle/Pistol Team, it man­
aged to finish well in two matches 
in Quantico, Virginia, and Penn 
State. The Drill Team also did 
well in their second showing at 
the annual Northwestern Drill 
Meet.
The Navy ROTC Rifle Team 
traveled to the Marine Corps base 
at Quantico, Virginia, for the first 
annual ROTC Invitational Pistol 
Match.
While berthed at the Marine 
Weapons Training Battalion, the 
rifle team competed with Navy 
ROTC units from Duke and Bos­
ton Universities, Renssaler Poly­
technic, Florida A&M, and sev­
eral others.
I n their first Quantico showing, 
finishing fourth overall, the Car­
negie Mellon team shone in the 
air pistol competition.
Individual platings by freshmen 
Midshipmen Chris Dunham, fin­
ishing sixth, Thomas Greene, fin­
ishing eighth, and sophomore 
Lane Boland, finishing ninth, con­
tributed greatly to the trophies 
brought home to Carnegie Mel­
lon.
The following week, the teams 
faced some much stiffer competi-
tion at the Penn State rifle and 
pistol meet.
Neither rifle nor pistol teams 
placed, despite high rifle scores 
by freshmen Midshipmen Matt 
McGarvey and Bruce Brunett. 
Midshipmen Dunham andBoland 
in the pistol competition also made 
strong showings, but it wasn’t 
enough to place.
This is the first pair of meets 
the newly formed Navy ROTC 
rifle/pistol team has attended, and 
if this is any indication, it looks 
like the rest of the year should be 
successful.
Meanwhile, the drill team, in­
cluding the Color Guard, joined 
other. Midwest area Navy ROTC 
teams at Recruit Training Com­
mand, Great Lakes, Illinois, for a 
drill competition sponsored by 
Northwestern University.
Here, the upperclass squad, 
composed of sophomore Midship­
men Serge Sherman (command­
ing), David Lockney, Luke Sironi, 
and John Heyel, juniors Nicholas 
Harrigan,Mark Schaeffer, and 
Chris Cory, took second place.
The drilling platoon finished 
fourth, while the freshman squad 
finished fifth.
Carnegie Mellon’s individual 
awards were earned by freshmen 
Midshipmen Chris Bareford, 
third, Coates Carter, fifth, and 
Allan Bourdious, sixth, in a knock­
out competition.

University Rowing Club
Three members of the Univer­
sity Rowing Club competed in the 
“Baltimore Bum,” a major er- 
gometer competition last Satur­
day.
Freshman Dan Murphy and 
sophomore Shawn Ohler raced in 
the heavyweight division, and al­
though Ohler turned in a PR of 
8:31, neither he nor Murphy 
qualified for the finals.
Junior lightweight Phil Meek 
also achieved his personal best 
time—8:52, and qualified for the 
finals, finishingin fifth place over­
all.
Coach Liz Winter was very 
pleased with their performance, 
feeling that all of them really 
fulfilled their individual poten­
tial and goals for the season.
The field was extremely com­
petitive and strong colleges from 
all over the East Coast were rep­
resented. The top places went pri­
marily to the teams of Temple 
and Navy, who both have strong, 
long-established rowing pro­
grams.
The next major ergometer 
competition for Carnegie Mellon 
is in Pittsburgh on March 1Y. This 
will be the last ergometer compe­
tition of the season. The team will 
then begin its on-water training 
and prepare for the spring regat­
tas.

art preservation

Many of us have great dreams and as­
pirations. For some of us, that includes 
influencing the course of history by de­
veloping a revolutionary alloy, discover­
ing a cure for cancer, or creating art­
works that will inspire the generations 
to come. Revolutionary alloys and cures 
for cancer can be recreated once discov­
ered, but what about fragile artworks 
that are one of a kind masterpieces?
For works of art that use paints and 
canvases, varnish has been usedformany 
years to cover and protect the actual 
paints from erosion, discoloring, and 
fading. Unfortunately, over long periods 
of time, varnish itself discolors and 
makes the picture look duller.
When the vamishbecomes grimy, some 
of the lustre is lost making it difficult to 
see what the artist originally intended.
Until recently, there was no way to 
safely remove the varnish without the 
risk of damaging the paints. In last 
Thursday’s lecture on the examination 
and preservation of old paintings, for­
mer medical research scientist Dr. Rich­
ard C. Wolbers discussed the applica­
tion of his skills as a microbiologist to 
the science of art conservation. He has
come up with better techniques to clean 
and preserve paintings.
First, he removes a small inconspicu­
ous spot from the painting and examines 
it under a microscope. In John Singleton 
Copley’s depiction of the “Battle of 
Dunkirk,” he removed a spot from an 
area that had already cracked and de­
cayed.
Though the size of the spot removed 
was smaller than the head of a pin, 
Wolbers said that a wealth of informa­
tion can be gained from examining the 
cross section of such a spot.
The cross sections are taken by placing 
the spot of the many layers into a mold 
and filling the mold with melted, clear 
plastic.
After the plastic has cooled, Wolbers 
slices the cube and places the slices under 
a microscope.
From there, he uses different dyes to 
illuminate various materials on the 
painting. This is the same procedure 
used in biology to distinguish different 
types of cells. The dyes are very specific 
and illuminate only one type of ingredi­
ent.
In one example, the applied dyes 
showed that some type of sugar was evi­
dent in the varnish. Through an

CFA sponsors the first of the Discovery Lecture Series
By DEXTER T. KOBAYASHI
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
In 'the past, Carnegie Mellon 
has sponsored its share of intrigu­
ing guest lecturers. Unfortu­
nately, for the most part, the 
words of these inspiring speakers 
have been confined to the Univer­
sity community. Last Thursday, 
Carnegie Mellon transcended 
these boundaries with the aid of 
modern technology.
Through the use of a combina­
tion of three KU and C-band sat­
ellites, a lecture was broadcast 
across the nation to over 350 high 
schools, colleges, and universities. 
The lecture, Face Value: The 
Examination and Preservation of 
a Pair of American Portraits, was
part of the Discovery Lecture 
Series. The February segment of 
the series was sponsored by 
CMU’s College of Fine Arts.
The topic of the lecture, held in 
Kresge Theatre, was the conser­
vation of art for future genera­
tions. The lecturer was Dr. Rich­
ard C. Wolbers, a combination 
scientist/art restorer at the Win­

terthur Museum in Delaware. He 
has a BS degree in biochemistry, 
a master’s degree in science, and 
another degree in studio art.
During the lecture Wolbers 
showed “before” and “after” slides 
of a pair of portraits done by Rich­
ard and William Jennys, and John 
Singleton Copley’s final painting 
which depicted the Battle of 
Dunkirk 150 years ago. He de­
scribed the techniques used in 
cleaning and restoring the paint­
ings.
Afterwards, the audience at 
Carnegie Mellon was invited to 
ask Wolbers questions about the 
lecture material. Questions were 
also phoned in from the four other 
interactive sites—Boston College, 
University of California at San
Francisco, University ofTexas at 
Austin, and Worcester Polytech­
nic Institute. The four interactive 
sites gave people from different 
colleges an opportunity to partici­
pate.
The Discovery Lecture Series is 
a series of lectures that corre­
sponds with The Infinite Voyage, 
a series of educational television 
programs. Scientists participat­
ing in The Infinite Voyage televi­
sion series periodically give in- 
depth lectures on their areas of 
expertise.
Each academic year, two uni­
versities are selected to host the 
lecture broadcasts. Producers of 
the series say Carnegie Mellon 
was chosen because it has strong 
departments in both the arts and
sciences.
The television special, which 
was previewed after the lecture, 
is entitled, “The Future of the 
Past,” and will be broadcast on 
most PBS stations throughout the 
nation on February 28 at 8 pm. 
Later on, the hour-long specials 
will be broadcast on select 
commmercial stations in Atlanta, 
Boston, Chicago, Dallas/Ft. 
Worth, Detroit, Hartford/ 
Newhaven, Los Angeles, Minnea­
polis, New York, Philadelphia, 
San Francisco, and Washington,
D.C.
The special deals with great 
works of art ranging from oil and 
canvas paintings to sculptures 
and architectural wonders. 
Wolbers will be featured in the 
program; explaining how his ex­
perience as a medical research 
scientist aided him preserve and 
clean old paintings.
The Infinite Voyage was spon­
sored by Digital Equipment Cor­
poration and produced by public 
television station WQED/Pitts- 
burgh in association with the 
National Academy of Sciences.

Each year, at least one class in 
CFA does the Cardboard Chairs 
project. This year, Boris Bally’s 
3D freshman design class took on 
the challenge.
The project is a study in the use 
of directional material - material 
that is only stable in one direc­
tion, like corrugated cardboard.
The object was to create a chair 
at least 24 inches high, capable of 
holding the creators weight (Pe­
ter Everett was used as a stan­
dard weight — 160 lbs.), using 
the least amount of cardboard and
no adhesives.
The majority of the class con­
centrated on joints and utilized 
the fact that the equilateral tri­
angle is the most stable shape 
that exists.
Ironically, the chair that sup­
ported the most weight, built by 
Hendrick Klawzon, did not use 
this feature.
The grade for each chair was 
based on its aesthetics, weight, 
whether or not it would hold 
Everett, the maximum weight 
that it would hold, and a notebook 
that the students used to keep 
track of their ideas and designs 
for the chair.

A Person’s Opinion
Everyone knows about fall 
rush. Each year, all the frater­
nities and sororities go out and 
try to get new pledges by throw­
ing parties and holding other 
types of social events.
But often, freshmen who are 
involved in rush during the fall 
feel hurried and many people 
don't pledge at various fraterni­
ties and sororities because they 
don’t feel they know enough 
about them. There are many 
reasons why people don’t pledge 
a greek house in the fall.
Springrushgives those people 
another chance to join a greek 
house.
This past weekend was the 
last in the spring rush, culmi­
nating in pledge night on Fri­
day.
So, we went out and asked 
several people what they thought 
about spring rush, in particu­
lar, this year's rush.
Dina Krausse 
Freshman, CIT
“I thoughtspringrush was good 
.... Mostly because I was a fresh­
man, I didn’t know about thefrats 
or sororities. This way, you have 
a semester to find out about them 
and then you could choose which 
one you wanted to rush.”
Tara Phillips 
Freshman H&SS
“It’s a lot less formal than fall 
rush. I don’t know, there’s not 
much to think about spring rush 
.... It’s pretty cool. I mean, it's nice 
to get some new guys in the fra­
ternities.”
Elizabeth Fruehan 
Senior H&SS
“It was very well organized this 
year. Howeverthe weekend that’s 
been taken off - I’m not sure 
that’s neccessary because most 
people are used to what’s been 
going on.”
Dave Shultz 
Freshman H&SS
“I think it’s great. It’s good 
because it lets the people really 
get in and see what the fraterni­
ties are all about. It brings them 
together and shows them some­
thing that they may not see. Plus 
there’s lots of free beer.”
Guy Paquette/Tartan Photographer 
Jon Weidlinger 
Junior H&SS
“When I came up here ... I 
came up for spring rush and 
that’s why I came here. But it 
dulled after the second time. 
I’m not really too involvedinit.’
No omremmbersinso many ways.
Wolbers discusses his technique of 
art preservation in last week’s lecture
vsERNEVC7 a8su PAHC 9T
associate,Wolbers found out that 
the varnish did in fact include 
sugar.
The procedure makes available 
much of the information that was 
lost before. With the aid of the 
microscope, art restorers can find 
out what materials were used in 
the original painting and varnish.
“These procedures create a fin­
gerprint of an artist’s technique,” 
says Wolbers. “Typically, much of 
an early painting is lost due to1 
time and restoration. The artist’s 
original materials and the date 
the painting was created are not
always known. But by taking a 
microscopic cross-section of the 
painting, we can come very close 
to determining how it may have 
looked and how many times it 
was renovated. This useful infor­
mation may have gone unnoticed 
in previous examinations.”
After figuring out what types of 
varnishes have been used through 
the use of special dyes, Wolbers 
creates water-based soaps to 
remove single layers of varnish 
by mixing enzymes. Each of the 
enzymes in the soaps react with 
the organic materials in the lac­
quers and removes them safely
without harming the painting.
Wolbers says he got involved in 
art preservation by accident. “My 
wife had gotten interested in 
’ architectural preservation. She 
had gone back to school to get a 
degree in architecture and had to 
do an internship,” he says. “I met 
somebody there through her in­
ternship that had convinced me 
to put the science and the art 
together.
“It’s really a reapplication of old 
technology. There’s a lot of tech­
nology that’s applicable to what 
we do, its just a matter of bring­
ing it into the field.”

DTD and Chatham team up 
for some midnight madness
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor
“I can’t believe it’s happening. 
I’m a freshman from New York 
and'I’m so excited.”
The reason for Debz Kavaler’s 
excitement is Midnight Madness, 
a charity event that she is coordi­
nating with senior Steve Black, a 
Delta Tau Delta brother at CMU. 
Midnight Madness is essentially 
i scavenger hunt across the CMU 
campus and the outlying area. 
Black would not disclose the ex­
act distance, because it would 
make the hunt easier for the teams 
participating.
The event started when Kav- 
aler, freshman class president of 
Chatham, and several of her 
friends decided that they wanted 
to do something useful with their 
time. “We looked for a fraternity 
to help. Carnegie Mellon and the 
fraternities have assets and ex­
periences with large events like 
this. They’re like big brothers.”
So Kavaler came down to DTD 
and met with Black. “She wanted 
to coordinate an event,” Black 
said, “She came over early this se­
mester and we threw ideas 
around.” Several good ideas came 
up, but when the idea of a scaven­
ger hunt was broached they in­
stantly knew that Midnight 
Madness was the thing to do.
Midnight Madness will start 
when the teams arrive at DTD 
about 11:30 pm Friday. The teams 
of five will be briefed on the rules 
of the game and then shown the 
prizes. At one minute intervals 
the teams will be given their first 
clue and then let into the night. 
The clues will be written mes­
sages telling the team to go some­
where to pick up their next clue. 
Black gave the sample clue of “Go 
to the flashcube,” which would 
require the team to go to Warner 
Hall to pick up its next clue. The 
clues will be harder than the 
sample clue, according to Black.
Black predicted that it will take 
the teams three to four hours to 
finish the hunt and return to DTD, 
where they will collect prizes 
depending on their finish.
Prizes include: gift certificates 
from stores ranging from pet 
stores to florists, cash, and mer­
chandise. The prizes are all fur­
nished by the many sponsors, who 
have donated items. For the first 
place team, there will be gift cer­
tificates and $125 in cash, which 
is $25 per person.
Registration for teams will 
continue through Thursday eve­
ning at five. At press time, there
were already between 15 and 18 
teams signed up, but Black hopes 
that this number will double be­
fore Thursday.
Anybody from either Chatham 
or Carnegie Mellon can be on a 
team, except for the organizers 
and the DTD brothers. Each team 
has to pay a $30 entrance fee,
which will go to the Make-A-Wish 
Foundation, the charity that was 
chosen because “it is one of the 
best charities for college stu­
dents,” according to Kavaler.
Make-A-Wish Foundation is 
dedicated to giving children and 
adolescents with terminal dis­
eases their last wish. “It’s unbe­
lievable what some of the kids 
want,” said Kavaler, “Onekidjust 
wanted to go to Disneyland; an­
other wanted a computer.”
DTD will set up tables outside 
of Doherty Hall this week for reg­
istration. In addition, Black will 
try to get information to RAs so 
that floors can organize their own
teams.
According to Black, this is being 
' billed as the first annual Mid­
night Madness, but “I don’t know 
if it will be repeated.”
“The project has taken its toll,” 
said Kavaler, “but things are com­
ing together.” She hopes that it 
will be an annual event.
All right, here is the story, you’ve 
heard it before so I won’t give too 
many of the details. I am walking 
home to my semi-palladial eighth 
floor apartment when all of a 
(sudden, BLAMMO, the mother­
ship lands and faster than you 
can say “Klaatu Barrada Nikto” I 
am standing in front'of the Su­
preme Intelligence itself.
Now, let me make one thing 
absolutely clear. I am not too fond 
of anything that goes around call­
ing itself the “Supreme Intelli­
gence”; the last Supreme thing I 
was acquainted with was Diana 
Ross and two other women who 
have since lapsed into obscurity, 
and apart from a few catchy songs, 
the only legacy they have left us 
was a Broadway musical starring 
Nell Carter.
In any case, there it is, the so- 
called Supreme Intelligence, 
which informs me that it is im­
perative to save the world and 
that it is willing to confer upon me 
some of its incredible, unbeliev­
able, supreme superpowers in or­
der to do so.
However, there is one catch. I 
can only choose one supreme 
superpower. Where is Martha 
Reeves when you really need her?
So what if it is a pretty far
THE EGO HAS LANDED
by Javier Grillo-Marxuach
fetched scenario? Everybody has 
fantasized about being a super­
hero, but most people do not real­
ize that being a superhero has 
just as many limitations as being 
a real human being.
Having a limited number of 
superpowers is a small consid­
eration in the limitations of being 
a superhero, but it is a good 
enough starting point.
Of course, there are the few 
idiots out there who claim that if 
they could be a superhero they 
would be Batman, because “Bat­
man has no superpowers and he 
has to rely solely upon his wit.”
Sure, that’s a noble thought, 
but it’s also a horrendously stu­
pid one. If I were stuck in a dark 
alley, surrounded by thugs while 
wearing nothing but black tights 
and long ears, my mind would be 
much too busy worrying about
the possibility of being mistaken 
for the Playboy Bunny to rely 
solely “upon my native wit.”
Assuming the choice of a single 
power with which to fix the world, 
an informal poll taken at about 
midnight in the offices of The Tar­
tan revealed that that old hardy 
perennial of superpowers is still 
the preferred alternative. A ma­
jority of people chose the ability to
fly.
Personally, I don’t think that 
the ability to fly would be particu­
larly useful in helping mankind. 
Consider this: Ducks can fly; does 
that do them much good in mak­
ing their environment more hos­
pitable? Not really—they just fly 
away until it all gets better. And 
there is not one duck around who 
will argue with the immediate 
law-creating ability of a double- 
barreled shotgun.
Besides, if you could fly, would 
you go around helping humanity? 
I don’t think so. I don’t mean to 
presuppose, but I have a feeling 
that, given the gift of flight, most 
people would be hanging around 
fire escapes and picture windows, 
hoping to catch their friends and 
enemies in flagrante delecto.
Even if you don’t use the gift of 
flight for y<?ur own visual pleas­
ure, I believe that said ability 
would probably get more use in 
the gathering of frequent flyer 
miles than in the apprehension of 
criminal minds.
The arguments against any one 
superpower are endless. In choos­
ing a superpower, the considera­
tion “boy, it would be fun if I 
could...” always takes precedence 
over “I could really apprehend 
criminals if I could...” or even “I 
could go on leading a normal life 
if I could...” X-Ray vision? Fun in 
the locker room, but not much fun 
when you are trying to read a 
magazine.
Super hearing? Try and sleep 
sometime when you can hear hair 
growing. The ability to fly under­
ground? One close encounter with 
a septic tank should be enough to 
clear you of that desire. Invisibil­
ity? Come on, some people have 
trouble not being invisible.
Some of the other choices for a 
single superpower that I received 
in the aforementioned informal 
survey really seem to have very 
few real world applications. 
Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t 
consider “perennial orgasm” to be 
a super-power.
If I had to choose a superpower 
I would choose something infi­
nitely absurd which would con­
fuse the criminals and cause great 
inconvenience to the public at 
large. I would choose the power to 
transform my body into the like­
ness of a city-block-sized melon. I 
could see a robber getting into 
more hell for disrupting traffic 
patterns into Oakland than for 
knocking over the local Uni-Mart.
This is why truly effective su­
perheroes such as the Mighty Mel- 
lonMan do not exist.
The scourge of crime is only a 
small inconvenience when com­
pared to the dread of not getting 
home in time to watch A Current 
Affair.
Personally, I have given up on 
the whole idea of being a super­
hero. Single power or not. First of 
all, being a superhero, be it one 
with only one power or with every 
power would only serve to remind 
me of my own humanity. Any­
body who has ever come down 
with a nasty case of the flu will 
know what I am talking about. 
Here we are, human beings, we 
can go to the moon, we can talk to 
one another over thousands of 
miles, we can beam in a new ver­
sion of The Brady Bunch to mil­
lions of people but we can still be 
bound and chained to a box of
Kleenex by a single microorgan­
ism.
Imagine how much worse this 
would be if it were accompanied 
by the knowledge that the Mighty 
MelonMan had to stay at home 
because of post-nasal drip.
In addition to being constantly 
reminded of my own insignifi­
cance, I also believe that constant 
superheroism is more trouble than 
it is worth.
Being the sole reason for the 
existence of the usual slew of 
supervillains which seem to 
spring up like scottie dogs at an 
Alpo factory whenever a super­
hero shows his face on planet 
Earth is much more of a burden 
than I am willing to bear.
Let’s be honest, does Lex Lu- 
thor really think Kryptonite is a 
good thing? No. Without Super­
man he would have to devote all 
of his time to actual criminal 
activity. I would hate to have all 
of my arch nemeses going around 
relying on their native wit, all 
because melons are relatively easy 
to kiU.

The board was set and ready in 
anticipation of a great intellec­
tual struggle.
Two game pieces, one green and 
the other blue, sat in readiness at 
the center of the multi-colored 
wheel.
Twelve pies waited eagerly to 
be won, and a $75 gift certificate 
for Gullifty’s hung in the balance.
As one team, the Omphaloskep­
tics, made it quite clear before the 
onset of the First Annual Trivial 
Pursuit Tournament, “This is the 
difference between eating good 
and eating real good!”
The Omphaloskeptics met 
Wednesday night in the Mudge 
lounge with the Interracial 
Bradys in the final round of the 
tournament to decide who would 
“eat real good.” It was classic clash 
of intellect, skill, wits, luck, and 
general knowledge of trivial 
matters.
Twenty-two teams from all over 
campus participated in the tour­
nament. Each game was played 
with the new “Eighties” questions 
because they were easy enough to
make the game go by faster, but 
difficult enough to make it a chal­
lenge. Also, each game in the 
tournament had a ninety-minute 
time limit.
The first blood was drawn on 
the third roll of the die when the 
green team, the Omphaloskep­
tics, earned a pie. They quickly 
added to their lead by earning yet 
another pie.
Not to be outdone, the Interra­
cial Bradys made their presence 
known by earning two pies to tie 
the game up at two apiece.
It was at this point which saw 
the game’s most bizarre question: 
“In 1987, who did seven out of ten 
people think God was?” The an­
swer given by the Interracial 
Bradys was George Bums. How­
ever, the correct answer, and one 
that wasn’t even mentioned in 
the discussion, was Jesus Christ.
A runner up for the most bi­
zarre question was this doozy: 
“What Midwestern state’s twenty- 
seven out of thirty-seven sena­
tors voted to let the blind hunt?” 
The correct answer was of course, 
Minnesota.
From then on it was all Ompha­
loskeptics. They took off and never
looked back, managing to earn 
four unanswered pies and finish 
the complete set with the orange. 
Ironically enough, the Interracial 
Bradys spent numerous turns and 
untold energy in attempt to earn 
the orange pie themselves. Un­
fortunately for them, it was 
not to be.
The Omphaloskeptics then 
answered the final question and 
solidified the victory, earning the 
right to “eat real good.” However1 
the Interracial Bradys didn’t ^ 
away empty handed. They won a 
$40 Gullifty’s gift certificate for 
taking second place. All four semi- 
final teams won t-shirts.
Playing for the championship 
team were freshmen Joy Jeffer­
son, Melissa Shirley, Michael I 
Yates, Ruth Zolock, and sopho­
more Joe Schuster. The Interra­
cial Bradys were 
Stephanie Chrisp, Daniel 
Sreeram Santhanam;
Ashanthi Gajaweera; and 
Debby Helfrich.
The tournament was spon 
by the Housing Office and 
and it was officiated by

“It’s a boat.”
“No, it’s an airplane.”
“No, it’s not. It’s ...”
Is someone describing Super­
man? Oh, no, of course not. It’s 
one of the large wooden toys some 
boys are playing with in the 
Morewood Gardens Child Care 
Center.
The Center, located on the lower 
level of the dormitory, can be 
entered from around the corner of 
the dining room, right in front of 
the parking lot.
Every step that you take down 
to the Center brings you a step 
closer to your childhood and those 
funfilled years.
There is a little cloak room in 
the main entrance where you can 
hang your coat on a hook roughly 
four feet high.
There are even little cubbyholes 
where you can place your things. 
Once you have taken off your coat, 
hat, scarf, and mittens, and put 
them all neatly away, it’s time to 
have fun!
You can paint, sculpt, get 
dressed up, build a castle, hear a 
story, or play “let’s pretend.” Your 
mind is set free, and you can be 
yourself.
One would think that the loud 
noises and constant buzzing of 
voices that are inherent in the 
Center would be very distracting

and possibly even irritating. But 
for sophomore Terri Estes, the 
Center is simply a place to un­
wind after a hard day of classes.
“A lot of people say that it’s 
stressful, but with me, it’s just 
the opposite. It just relaxes me so 
much to be here.”
Students from Pitt or Point Park 
College, who work at the Center 
are there mainly because it is 
relates to their majors in early 
childhood education.
But Estes, a CMU mechanical 
engineering major, works here to 
get a break from all the studying 
she does.
“It takes your mind off the little 
things in your life when a little 
girl comes up to you crying, ‘Emily 
won’t be my friend anymore.’ And 
I think ‘Oh, this poor child,’ and I 
wish that those were the things I 
still worried about,” says Estes, 
sitting at a table that came up 
just to her knees.
Estes say s that she understands 
what the other children go 
through, since, like everyone else, 
she once went through it herself. 
She tries to be as open as possible, 
and talks to the children all the 
time so that no one is upset or 
feels left out.
She says this is one of the many 
benefits you can get from working 
at the Center: the satisfaction that 
you have made someone else 
happy.
While Estes says that she needs 
the money from the job, she also 
makes it clear that money was 
notthe incentive for working here: 
“I really enjoyed babysitting in 
high school, and I just didn’t want 
to give up children when I got 
here.”
There are many different age 
groups, but most of the children 
are’between three and five years 
old. They are broken down in 
groups according to age: 2-3, 3-4, 
4-5, and kindergarten.
Estes says that it can some­
times be a challenge to work with 
so many kids at one time, but they 
take an hour-and-a-half nap ev­
ery day, so that there is a period of 
“quiet time."
“I wish CMU had a two-hour 
nap every day,” she says. “We for­
get how to take a time out.”
At a school like CMU, time outs

But Estes is one of those who work, 
continues to do work in her little 
free time, because she gets sheer 
pleasure from it at the Child Care 
Center. Her heart is clearly in her
are very important in order to 
stay with it. Some people sleep, 
others play a sport, and still oth­
ers read a book, watch television, 
or listen to the radio.

Valentine’s Day events don’t match up with the festive spirit
By JILL DENESVICH
Tartan Staffwriter
Bed roses, cuddly stuffed ani­
mals, candy in bright red heart 
shapedboxes, and cute cards bring 
to mind Cupid’s favorite festive 
event, Valentine’s Day. 
[Valentine’s Day is one of those 
days to remember those you love: 
mommy, daddy, sister, brother, 
wife, husband, boyfriend, girl­
friend.
Thinking back to a Valentine’s 
iDay in elementary school, I re­
member making my Valentine’s 
Day box to collect all of the cards
I would receive from my fellow 
students the next day in school.
I would always wrap my box in 
aluminum foil and paste red and 
pink paper hearts on it. I always 
thought I had the coolest little 
box in my class. However, I knew 
that without the modem techno­
logical advances that produce alu­
minum foil, I would not have had 
this awesome box.
Anyway, the next day I would 
climb on the big yellow bus 
proudly displaying my beautiful 
box to all the kids that got on at 
each stop. When I arrived at 
school, I placed it on my desk and

left it there until it was time for 
all of us to pass out the Valentine 
cards.
Finally, the end of the day ar­
rived and it was time. Each of us 
passed out our thirty one cards —
one for each person in the class 
and an extra special big one for 
the teacher.
After that was done, we would 
open and read them and put them 
backin our Valentine’s Day box to
take home. The teacher would 
then pass out large red lollipops 
shaped like a heart. Oh, what fun 
Valentine’s Day was in grade 
school.
Thirteen years later, I walked 
into a large room on Valentine’s 
Day and the professor gives me 
five white pieces of paper with 
black lettering, it was a chemis­
try test. This was a far cry from 
the expected and hoped for ro­
manticism.
However, this time it is not ele­
mentary school, it’s Carnegie 
Mellon University. In fact, every 
experience I had that day had
little to do with the traditional 
love and caringofValentine’s Day. 
Where were the heart-shaped 
candy boxes and the bouquet of 
red roses?
Two days later was the only 
event that had any resemblance 
to a Valentine’s Day celebration. 
I attended the Valentine’s Dance 
sponsored by the Asian Students 
Association. The turn out was not 
spectacular, due to poor advertis­
ing. House music was played and 
buffet style hors d’oeuvres were 
served.
A lot has changed since elemen­
tary school.
If you go to Wyle E.’s Pub, bring your hardhat and a catcher’s mitt

As I said last week, where the 
hell was I? I had walked about 
three feet in the direction of the 
fossilized ketchup arrow before 
the question that had plagued me 
forever was answered. According 
¡to the green travel sign I was in 
England, home of The Who and 
land of the Led.
I was on an interstate highway 
in England, even though England 
had no states. To be exact it was 
Highway 66: Time to getmy kicks.
I started walking again. After 
passing Buckingham Palace twice 
I decided I needed a drink, so I 
stopped in a bar, Wyle E.’s Pub.
A dandy place — let me de­
scribe it to you. Inside there is a 
wooden loft called Mount 
Olympus, where Wyle E. himself 
sits and serves the customers.
From atop his post, he throws 
the drinks to, at, or on the pa­
trons, depending on how many he 
has had. A bit of advice for all of 
you so called world-wide travel­
ers, if you do stop in Wyle E.’s 
Pub, bring your hardhat.
Now let me describe the 
barowner in question. He looked
AROUND THE WORLD 
IN EIGHTY BEERS
by William Burky
like that famous actor of screen 
and stage, the one that his par­
ents named him after, Wyle E. 
Coyote.
I sat down and yelled up to 
Wyle E. for a beer. He made a 
strange guttural noise and threw 
down a bottle of Bass & Co.’s Pale 
Ale. I immediately threw it back 
at him and told him to open it.
I had to wait a while, though; 
another drunk, I mean customer, 
wanted his rum and coke refilled. 
Wyle E. took a bottle of Baccardi, 
poured some on the customer, for­
tunately got some in the glass, 
shook up a coke, and opened it in 
the poor guy’s direction.
He finished him off by hurling a 
piece of lime into the man’s eye. 
After watching the man leave the 
bar, Wyle E. finally opened my 
bottle and threw it back at me. 
Luckily, I had my catcher’s mitt.
I sniffed the bottle.
I muttered softly to myself, 
“Hmm, smells like beer....”
“Yeah.”
I looked around, wondering who 
talked to me. I didn’t see anyone. 
Oh well. I took a swig.
“Hmm, it’s a pretty normal beer, 
unlike the thick beers I’ve been 
tasting lately.”
“Yeah.” ,
This started to annoy me.
Suddenly, I was punched. Ap­
parently the puncher decided to 
hit me in the foot with his face. I 
looked under the table to see who 
the aggressor was.
He had a “My name is Nod” 
sticker on his forehead.
“Hi, Nod,” I said.
“Yeah.”
I figured the conversation 
wasn’t going too far, so I went 
back to my beer.
“It’s so average.”
“Yeah.”
“It doesn’t taste like water­
melon, or mincemeat, or tapioca 
pudding, or even a peanut-butter 
and jelly sandwich.”
“Yeah.”
“What do you mean, ‘Yeah’?”
“Uh?”
“Are you agreeing with me?” I 
asked.
Wyle E. spoke up. “That’s just 
Nod you’re talking to. He’s drunk 
and his shoes are tied together
Bill Matisse, a great artist, 
ends his life as a hood ornament
One of the most brilliant, cer­
tainly the most misunderstood of 
all twentieth century artists 
would have to be Bill Matisse.
The great-great-great-grandson 
of the noted post-impressionist 
painter, Matisse followed in his 
famous relative’s footsteps, be­
coming a leader in the post-nihil- 
ist pre-environmentalist style of 
art which was to become so preva­
lent in late 1967, right around the 
holidays.
The youngest of twelve sons, 
Matisse had a difficult childhood. 
His father left their family two 
years before Bill was born to 
pursue his career as a Chinese 
plate juggler. His mother, an 
immigrant, could not speak any 
jlish, so Matisse grew up 
speaking nothing but Swedish.
This rebellious woman was 
actually Italian, but so hated the 
language that she never spoke 
any language but Swedish.
This irrational hatred carried 
over into young Matisse, who, up 
until his death, could never walk 
by a pizzeria without flying into a 
rage.
Despite this idiosyncrasy, Ma­
tisse dearly loved his mother, and 
it was her influence which first 
prompted Matisse to start his 
career as a painter. He began by 
doing the living and dining rooms 
in double gloss acrylic, and then 
proceeded to still lifes, and finally 
to portraiture.
Then one day, tragedy struck. 
Matisse’s mother was hit by a bus 
while trying to rescue a candy 
Wrapper from imminent destruc­
tion. The candy wrapper escaped 
with only minor injuries, but 
Matisse’s mother died.
Matisse was inconsolable, and 
his paintings reflected the gloom 
which had descended over him. 
They were dark, moody, expres- 
sionistic pieces in which he tried
JASON SPEAKS
by Jason Lee Smith
to convey humankind’s place in 
the universe, plus an occasional 
clown thrown-in for variety.
Gradually, the artist got over 
his mother’s death and began to 
turn his mind to other things. He 
became interested, as did many 
of his contemporaries, in the rec­
reational use of various forms of 
contraband narcotics. He was, 
however, very worried about the 
effects such substances were 
having on his mind. From his 
journal:
I fear I am going insane. Today
I bought a magazine and paid the 
vendor in chicken fat. Last night I 
had that same disturbing dream 
that I was being force-fed linguini 
by four Buddhists on unicycles. I 
shall never mix hashish and Tyle­
nol again.
One day, an unsteady, wild-eyed 
Matisse walked through the doors 
of Ed’s Sushi Smorgasborg, one of 
his favorite haunts. He was clearly 
notin control. He ranted on about 
how he believed the owner, Ed, 
was actually the reincarnated soul 
of Leo Tolstoy. When Ed denied 
this, Matisse flew into a rage, 
shouting “Why did you have to 
write War and Peace in Russian? 
It loses all of its significance!” 
And then he attacked him. The 
next day, urged by his friends, 
Matisse checked into a sanitar­
ium.
It was a reborn Matisse who 
emerged nine months later. While 
inside, he had found love, in the
because he tends to wander 
around when drunk. Give him 
this hot dog and he’ll leave you 
alone.”
Wyle E. was right. I handed 
Nod the hot dog, whereupon he 
crawled out the door and spewed.
I moved to retrieve him, but 
Wyle E. told me to ignore him.
So I did.
I took another gulp of my Bass 
Ale and then I saw the three most 
beautiful women I had ever seen, 
over in the corner.
I happened to focus my eyes, 
however, and saw that it was 
really just one woman, but she 
was perfect!
Why, you ask. Because she had 
a beer in one hand and her face 
reminded me of the White Bur­
ger.
I said, “Hey, Baby....”
She turned my way and her 
blue eyes struck me like that wild 
pitch thrown by the 
Scuzzmonauts’ pitcher in little- 
league.
She came over to me, and asked, 
“You’re the infamous Pennsylva­
nia Bill, aren’t you?”
I replied, “To quote someone 
who just left, Teah.’ ”
“I’d just love to throttle your 
engine,” she moaned.
“Actually, my car’s an auto­
matic.”
“Well, maybe you should just 
park it in my garage, then,” she 
suggested.
“Why? Your garage is here in 
England, but my car is back in the 
States.”
She sighed.
I sneezed.
Then, she jumped up and 
dragged me to her apartment. 
After a time, or a few times, actu­
ally, I grew t,o like her. I ventured 
a question.
“What’s your name?”
She snored.
I sighed.
She sneezed. Oh well, maybe in 
the morning. I guess I gave her 
my cold. I hope she didn’t give me 
anything in return.
Eventually, dawn came, and we 
woke up.
“Who are you?”
“I’m your Mother.”
“WHAT?!” I screamed while 
yelling.
“Just a joke.”
“Oh.”
“I’m Athena Suzanne Sorbet. 
But you can call me ‘A.S.S.’ ”
I choked on my tongue. “If you 
insist,” I replied.
“So, what are you doing in 
England?” she asked.
“Well, I’m search of the White 
Burger.”
She choked on my tongue. 
After a couple hours, she re­
plied, “I like you. Tell you what: I 
think I might know someone who 
can help you.”
We headed back to Wyle E.’s 
Pub.

form of Laura Bimdeen, a nice 
young paranoid schizophrenic he 
met during a session of shock 
therapy. It was an ill-fated ro­
mance, though. Three months 
later, Bimdeen ran off with Ziggy 
Seidfeld, the noted car thief and 
part-time brain surgeon.
Matisse became despondent, 
rarely leaving his apartment for 
weeks on end. His journal from 
this time is filled with his brood­
ing on man’s inhumanity to his 
fellow men:
I went into the city today. No 
wonder I keep to my rooms. I was 
standing on the corner of Fifth 
and Madison and saw a large 
swiss cheese begging for money. 
Suddenly, I was very aware of my 
Nordic heritage. Walking by an 
alley, I saw a teenager rob a blind 
man, then the blind man robbed 
the teenager, then the teenager 
robbed the blind man again, then 
they both had lunch. Are we no 
better than animals?
He gradually became suicidal, 
and attempted to kill himself 
several times. First, by not pay­
ing his electrical bill. Then, by 
trying to french-kiss a yak. Fi­
nally, by putting slices of salami 
on his head. But it was no use, he 
was even denied that small meas­
ure of satisfaction.
Matisse emerged from his 
apartment building that Novem­
ber morning, a broken man. It 
was originally his intention to go 
down to the hospital and attempt 
to catch a fatal illness, but as he 
attempted to cross the street he 
was struck and killed by a bus. 
Ironically, it was the same bus 
which had killed his mother those 
many years ago, proving that all 
of life is circular, or at least slightly 
elliptical.

Personal Computing Support
ANNOUNCING MACADVISOR
On January 16, 1989 Academic Computing’s Personal Computing Support Group 
implemented MacAdvisor. MacAdvisor is an electronic mail help service similar to Andrew 
Advisor. MacAdvisor is a trial service for the spring semester. If this service is useful to the 
campus community, we will continue it on a permanent basis after the spring semester ends. 
The purpose of MacAdvisor is to answer questions that faculty, students and staff on campus 
may have about using their Macintosh hardware and software.
The type of questions we expect to answer are questions that come up with everyday usage. 
Questions like: “I just bought an ImageWriter and plugged it in and it won’t work. Now what 
do I do?” or “It is taking much longer than before to open folders on my desktop. Why? And 
how can I fix it?” Please don’t worry about sending questions to Mac Advisor because you think 
they might be too basic. We are here to help everyone. MacAdvisor is a private e-mail service. 
Other users on campus won’t be able to read your mail or our responses. MacAdvisor is 
intended to supplement, not replace any support tools you are currently using. We cannot 
respond immediately to questions. We will, however, attempt to have a 24 hour turn-around 
time for questions.
To request MacAdvisor assistance, send electronic mail to 
MacAdvisor@andrew (ma55@andrew).

H8A7VARCo Rs Oc-
By MARVIN GERMANY, 
WASEEM HUSSAIN,
Tartan Staffwriters
& STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Diversions Editor
In this pressure cooker univer­
sity of computer terminals, prob­
lem sets, and 8:30 classes, we 
find ourselves looking for outlets 
beyond the scope of academia: 
DH 2210, intramurals, TV, Grey 
Matter, video games, music, 
comic books....
“Comic books?” some of you ask. 
Yes, comic books. Over the past 
few years, comic books have gone 
from being a mere childhood pas­
time to an addictive hobby for 
people of all ages.
“I’ve been reading and collect­
ing comic books since I was four­
teen,” says sophomore John Scott 
Ross, an ECE major.
“Second grade was [whenI gotj 
my first comic book,” recalls 
senior writing major Dan Bidwa. 
“But I didn’t start collecting until 
fourth grade.”
Junior sculpture major R.J. 
Runas says, “[Some people] think 
that you should have gotten over 
them when you were a little kid. 
That’s not true. I still enjoy them.”
Not unlike the steam tunnels, 
comic books have an unseen 
presence at CMU. However, if 
you take a stroll down to South 
Craig Street in Oakland, and 
notice the life sized figure of Jack 
Nicholson as the Joker smiling 
at you through a window, you 
have reached the Phantom of the 
Attic, one of Pittsburgh’s largest 
comic book outlets. If you ven­
ture inside, you are more than 
likely to find a mob of people 
thumbing through the latest 
books to hit the rack.
Many of the people there you 
might recognize as CMU students 
who have secretly made their way 
to dig for this buried treasure of 
the literary world. To guide you 
in your search for superheroes 
and talking turtles is Phantom’s 
popular manager, Jeff Yandora, 
and his two sidekicks, Arthur 
Allen and David Martin.
“It’s a fantasy world. People 
can escape,” said Yandora.
“They’re like soap operas — 
they’re addictive, they’re fantas­
tic things.... They’re mind candy!”
“CMU students read them 
because they are written at our 
level, and drawn to meet our 
tough readership standards,” 
says CIT freshman Brent Gold­
berg.. Demographics, .indeed, 
show that the average comic book 
reader is around twenty years 
old.
Perhaps the fundamental rea­
son people read comic books is 
their ability to deliver blue-rib- 
bon stories. Or perhaps it’s their 
ability to set up a series of paral­
lel lives different from that of the 
reader. Or maybe people just read 
them to relax.
‘You go into-your own little 
world when you read comic 
books,” says Runas. “It’s kind of 
like escapism. Just close the door, 
turn on some music, and ignore 
the world.”
“It’s something that students 
can just read and not have to 
worry about remembering,” says 
Martin.
But why comic books as op­
posed to movies, music, or some 
other form of entertainment? 
What’s the special attraction of 
comic books?
“Its great to have a continuing 
story line every month,” says 
Ross. “I guess it’s like a soap 
opera.”
“I like a lot of different comics 
for a lot of different reasons,” 
says Allen. “I tend to laugh at the 
majority of the stuff I like. Most 
of the stuff I read makes me 
laugh.”
“It’s like reading a book, except 
this one has pictures in it,” ex­
plains Runas.
Comics do different things for 
different people, but how does 
someone get started in this ever­
growing hobby when there a lit­
erally hundreds of different books 
to choose from?
In comics, there are diverse 
genres just as in literature. Su­
perheroes, satire, horror, and 
science fiction, along with a smat­
tering of other books, are in a 
category by themselves.
Unarguably, the most popular
genre is that of the superhero. Even 
though there is the universal 
theme of good guys versus bad 
guys, it is in the unique way that 
some books interpret this conflict 
which makes them stand out above 
the rest.
For example, there are the stan­
dard superhero comic books that 
are relatively straightforward and 
just plain fun to read. The best of 
these are the energetic Avengers 
titles, the kinetic Fantastic Four, 
the stylistically rich X-Men, and 
all of the intricately linked
Superman titles which bring con­
tinuity to new heights.
Then there are the more offbeat 
superhero titles which present 
fresh new perspectives on tradi­
tional plots, such as The Hulk, 
which brings the archetypical 
Jekyll and Hyde conflict to a fas­
cinating new level. Other offbeat 
books include Dr. Strange, Flash, 
Legion ’90, and Daredevil.
In the past few years another 
new superhero genre has emerged
— the noir gritty type, almost 
anti-hero. These books are dark,
tastefully done, and suspenseful 
to the core. This category includes 
Question, Green Arrow, and Bat­
man.
Then there are books which are 
a challenge to read. They taunt, 
they tease, they frustrate the 
reader with their complex phi­
losophies, surreal plots, and bi­
zarre characters. How often do 
you see a walking plant with a 
wife and child, paintings that eat 
whole cities, or comic book char­
acters who know that they’re 
comic book characters? Yandora
this genre “intelligent comics,” the 
best of which are The Doom Pa­
trol, Animal Man, Hellblazer, and 
Sandman.
“It all goes hand-in-hand. The 
music I like fits into the comics I 
like, and the books I like, and the 
movies I like,” says Martin. 
“There’s something for everyone.”
Indeed, whether you’re just an 
occasional reader or a hard core 
collector, comic books with all 
their diversity and originality 
have something to offer for every-
Ladysmith Black Mambazo electrifies the Ballroom
By JAMES B. ENDRES
. Tartan Contributing Editor
Never have ten voices made a sound 
so unique. Or so emotional.
Never have I been so moved.
And never has the Skibo Ballroom 
seen as much energy, passion, Zulu 
dance, and a capella “Ngomabusuki”
— “music of the night” — as what 
Ladysmith Black Mambazo poured out 
Thursday night.
A sellout crowd crammed into the 
Ballroom early and if you didn’t get 
your ticket a week ahead of time, well, 
you were out of luck.
The place was more than full, and it 
was long before the show was going to 
start. The room heated up and people 
chattered together, giddy. The floor 
crackled in anticipation. The AB secu­
rity guys standing in front of the stage 
looked a little nervous.
Finally, the lights went down.
Amid warm applause, the band 
walked down the aisle that parted the 
sea of audience — smiling, waving, 
shaking hands, touching, laughing. 
Taking their time, they walked onto 
the stage and began to sing with the 
ease and joy of ten men who love their 
music, love each other, and thatThurs- 
day night in Pittsburgh, loved their 
audience.
Five hundred mouths hung agape.

foot stomp, every breath, every tongue

most popular musical export.
We were captivated.
“Hello My Baby” was the song Black 
Mambazo warmed us up with. It takes 
a while to get used to seeing ten guys 
belting out an entire symphony with 
nothing but their larynxes. We soon 
felt welcome.
I’d heard a little about the band be­
fore I went to the concert. They were 
from South Africa, sangtraditionalZulu 
stuff. Influenced Paul Simon and helped 
him make Graceland. Were led by a 
man named Joseph Shabalala, who, 
when I met him later, turned out to be 
the warmest, gentlest, most generous 
human being I’ve ever come across.
From South Africa. I guess I expected 
the music to be full of anger, rage, 
hopelessness. So I guess I was sur­
prised to hear a resounding message of 
love, hope, patience, humble reverence.
How do you compose your music?
“I think this is a gift. It just comes, it 
just comes to me spontaneously. When 
it is coming, I feel as if there are many
around me — but there is loneliness. I 
am alone, and the sound comes. Some­
times the songs come to me in my 
dreams...:’
Ladysmith Black Mambazo sang 
about love, marriage, dowries, Paul 
Simon, coalminers, peace, religion, and 
exile.
The sounds that the ten voices of 
Black Mambazo bring forth curl up in 
your ears like a sleepy kitten. The 
sounds soar and glow and whirl and, 
with a color and texture and life of their 
own, keep swimming in your head even 
after they’re gone. Black Mambazo 
sounds like somebody opened all the 
pipes in an organ and a perfect chord 
came out. They just stand up on stage 
and open their mouths and the sounds 
are bom and it looks easy. They have 
smiles on their faces.
And they danced. Boy, did they dance. 
Ladysmith Black Mambazo danced 
Thursday night no dance that any 
American can dance. It wasn’t as if they 
performed improbable stunts. It wasn’t 
even as if they were perfectly synchro-

Principal Dancer Steven Annegarn graces the stage with style
By DAWN BROSONSKI
-Tartan Asst. Diversions EditorIf“
Steven Annegarn, principal 
;! dancer at the Pittsburgh Ballet 
;i Theatre since August of 1989, is 
finding his life finally beginning 
; to click. The 26-year old ballet 
marvel from South Africa has 
found success in Pittsburgh, and 
accepts it graciously and with a 
; surprising calm.
; “Sometimes after you’ve done a 
i; performance you feel very satis- 
fied; you feel like you’ve achieved 
something,” he says. “It might 
not be the most important per- 
I' formance you’ve ever done, but 
!• someperformancesjustclick.and 
!; that’s wonderful.”
Seated in his dressing room 
Rafter a vigorous rehearsal of 
Giselle, a romantic ballet and a 
key work in the ballet repertory 
worldwide, Annegarn is comfort­
able, yet ready to be on the move. 
As he sits, his hands and feet are 
often in motion; he alternately 
stretches his arms and legs, flex­
ing his feet and gracefully point­
ing his toes toward the ceiling.
Begiimings
Annegarn speaks with a sooth­
ing, thoughtful voice as he re­
flects on his background. Born 
'just outside of Johannesburg, 
South Africa, Annegarn grew up 
" with a very well-to-do lifestyle.
“During the time I was growing, 
up, [South Africa] probably had 
one of the best lifestyles in the 
world, in that you had a large 
I amount of servants and cooks,” 
'.he said. “Even middle-class fami- 
I lies had a lot of servants... obvi- 
< ously blacks were to be exploited.”
Annegarn found growing up 
; relatively easygoing, but he was 
uncomfortable amidst the racism 
and political struggle going on in 
; South Africa. His desire to leave 
;:the country grew rapidly, and he 
>finally found himself an escape 
'route at the age of 15.
“I started dancing as a kind of 
¦hobby to hang around a girl I 
^fancied at the time. I didn’t plan 
‘.on being a dancer, but it turned 
;out to be an opportunity for me to 
ieave the country, which is what I 
iwas looking for.... Males doing 
ballet in South Africa are out of 
:."the ordinary. Lots of little white 
girls do it, but no little white boys; 
it was really frowned upon. I don’t 
;know if that was part of making 
me feel an outsider as well, and 
imaybe giving me a closer look at 
'.the kind of chauvinism and ra­
cism that was going on.”
¦ When Annegarn turned 18 he 
"faced the possibility of entering 
the army, something he was ve­
hemently against. His dancing
4ERIsEy O8NvpuAymvsV8RCoy ,NRRofV8HI dAiiCR eICAR8C
proved to be a saving grace. “There 
are special circumstances in 
which you can do certain study­
ing, like dance, where they make 
you exempt from the army for one 
or two years,” says Annegarn. “I 
knew that I didn’t want to get into 
the army and go and shoot people 
in my own country, and at that 
time they didn’t tell you a lot of 
what was happening in South 
Africa, but I got the idea more or 
less of what they were doing, and 
shooting black children was not 
part of my game plan.”
Fortunately, fate smiled upon 
Annegarn. A dance teacher from 
London visited South Africa, saw 
Annegarn’s work, and recom­
mended him to the Royal Ballet 
School in London.
“I did feel claustrophobic in 
South Africa; I had read about 
other countries and I wanted to 
travel. More importantly, I 
wanted to leave, and when the 
opportunity came to go to the 
Royal Ballet School, it was per­
fect for me.... Although profes­
sional dancing was not at the top 
of my list, I thought, Yay! I’ll get 
out of South Africa!’ And out I 
went.”
Coining to America
Annegarn studied at the Royal 
Ballet School for two years. His 
first professional work came-with 
a season’s tour with London’s 
Saddlers Wells Royal Ballet 
Company, which occurred just 
prior to joining the Londoi^ City
Ballet in 1984.
“I was in a company [London 
City Ballet] which had the benefit 
of performing more than any other 
ballet company in the world. We 
had 38-week seasons with 8 per­
formances a week. I kind of grew 
up and learned my dancing on 
stage, which is unusual because 
dance is usually a lot of back­
ground work, and then you show 
what you can do. [The company] 
just performed so much; you had 
to get up there and learn as you 
went.”
Annegarn was promoted to so­
loist in 1985, and a year later he 
became principal dancer. Un­
known at the time to Annegarn, a 
dream-come-true was also in the 
works.
“I heard through an acquain­
tance who was working in Pitts­
burgh as a teacher that Patricia 
WiHe [artistic director at Pitts­
burgh Ballet Theatre] was look­
ing for a principal dancer,” says 
Annegarn. “I enjoyed London, but 
America had always been a place 
I wanted to visit and dance in. It 
has a slightly different dance 
tradition, like lots more [George] 
Balanchine, which I wasn’t get­
ting any of in London.”
To Annegam’s delight, Wilde 
was impressed with his work. At 
her invitation, Annegarn came to 
the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre as 
principal dancer at the end of 
August 1989.
“I’d always thought that danc­
ing in America wasn’t going to be 
possible,” Annegarn admits, his
eyes growing thoughtful with the 
memory. “Suddenly, when I 
wasn’t even searching for it, 
America came to me. You have 
goals, but it seems when you are 
least concentrating on them 
they’re most likely to come true.
“Because I tried; when I first 
got out of the Ballet School I 
auditioned all over and I couldn’t 
get anything. Then somebody 
from America heard about me, 
and here I am.”
When one thinks of where to go 
for ballet in America, Pittsburgh 
is perhaps not the first city that 
leaps to mind. What was it that 
Pittsburgh in particular had that 
say, New York, didn’t? “Patricia 
Wilde,” Annegarn says, with a
confident nod of the head. “Pitts­
burgh maybe isn’t known as a 
ballet city, but Patricia Wilde 
obviously has a fine reputation.”
Annegarn recalls his first per­
formance at PBT. “Actually, my 
first performance, I hate to say....” 
Annegarn grins, leaning forward. 
“I came here and they were doing 
a collaboration with the orches­
tra and Heinz Hall, and it was 
going to be pieces by Tchaikovsky 
and a few of the dancers were 
going to dance different pieces 
from his ballets in front of the 
orchestra.
“One of the dancers went off, 
and in two days I had to get it 
together to fill in — it was like, 
‘Whoa!’... But it was good because 
it broke me in to the company and 
we didn’t have to wait months 
looking at each other, wondering, 
‘how are we going to look on 
stage?’”
The Dance
“I appreciate the physical side 
of it,” says Annegarn, speaking of 
his feelings for dance. “I’d always 
been a sportsman before I turned 
to dance — soccer, rugby, tennis, 
golf — everything. The physical- 
ity of dance can be very exhilarat­
ing.” Annegarn speaks slowly, 
choosing his words carefully and 
honestly.
“It was quite later when I 
started to perform that I began to 
feel another type of exhilaration 
—the kind when you know you’ve 
caught the audience’s imagina­
tion, or you’re caught up in some 
sort of emotion and you’re carry­
ing them along with you. That’s a 
very satisfying feeling, but very 
hard to put into words.”
When a dancer is on stage, he or 
she must master intense concen­
tration while being capable of 
•emitting strong emotions, and at 
the same time connecting with
the audience. Aside from the ac­
tual dance, all this certainly seei$s 
like a challenge in itself.
“Your concentration is on many 
things,” says Annegarn, “but in 
each instance you may be concen­
trating on one particular thing. 
For example, if you’ve got a par­
ticularly difficult passage of danc­
ing physically to doy you’ll be 
concentrating on ‘faster,’ or 
‘quicker,’ or ‘higher,’ or something 
like that. Or if you have a very 
tiring section ahead, you’ll be 
saying, ‘breathe, breathe,’.... Very 
often you’ll be concentrating on 
connecting with another dancer 
— looking them in the eyes.”
“At the same time, you almost 
know when the audience is enjoy, 
ing it or not, somehow. Through 
the sounds they make, through^ 
feeling of concentration in the aft, 
you do feel whether the audience 
is with you or not.”
Last week, Annegarn performed 
the role of Albrecht in the ballet 
Giselle, a romantic tale of star- 
crossed lovers, performed at tlje 
Benedum Center. This weeft, 
Annegarn will perform in two oiit 
of three short ballets during “TKe 
Virtuoso Weekend,” also at the 
Benedum.
According to Annegarn, it is 
quite challenging to perform -a 
particular work one week, and 
then perform another completely 
different work the following week. 
“I’m doing one ballet one week, 
and the next I’m jumping into 
something totally different. We’ve 
been rehearsing for quite a bit,” 
he says.
The three ballets will be Czech 
choreographer Jiri Kylian’s Re­
turn to the Strange Land, 
Balanchine’s Theme and Vari­
ations, and Lisa de Ribere’s Mu­
sic. Annegarn will perform in the 
first two.

The Upstage is having 
a Gothic extravaganza
MUSIC IN REVIEW
by Dan Bidwa
King Missile is coming, but not for a 
while, so don’t get too excited yet. 
They’ll be at the Turmoil Room on 
March 8, with the eminently missable 
Hypnolovewheel. Justin case you were 
wondering....
Coming up a bit sooner is the Young 
Gods/Holy Cow/Red Temple Spirits 
show at the Upstage Thursday (that’s 
the twenty-second, if you wuz wun- 
derin). It’s billed as a Gothic extrava­
ganza, so you can wear your black and 
poofy hair and not be embarrassed. 
Actually, it should be a good show — 
the Red Temple Spirits are one of the 
few bands to ever do a good Pink Floyd 
cover (two, actually), and their live 
show should be a lot more rock ori­
ented than their albums.
As for the Young Gods, they’re just 
about the only band to get the whole
Wax Trax/industrial disco/whatever- ' 
the-fuck-it’s-called thing right. They’re - 
from Switzerland; they’re a trio (vo-1 ¦ 
cals, drums, and samples); they use1 : 
sampled guitar noise instead of both- 
ering with the guitars; and while they 
don’t necessarily rock in the biblical 
sense, they’re far more interestingthan 
the entire Greater Than Front 242 
Line Kill Kult gang. And they sing iri- 
French. The whole thing should start * 
sometime around eight on Thursday 
night. Tickets are $12, and available 
in advance at Jim’s and National 
Record Mart if you want to bother (it’s' 
probably not going to sell out, not in 
advance at least).
Other stuff going on in the next few 
days, or at least until next Tuesday: 
The Art Ensemble of Chicago will be at 
the Fulton Theater on Saturday. Tick­
ets are kinda pricey (probably around 
$15), and even more so if you’re used to 
paying five bucks for a show, but this 
is a rare occurrence. The Art Ensemble 
plays a combination of freeform im­
provisation and straight jazz and a 
bunch of other stuff that I simply don’t 
have the vocabulary to describe, ex­
cept to say that they’re unique, and 
not to be missed.

Pair up Aaron Spelling, pro­
ducer of such blockbuster televi­
sion hits as The Love Boat, Fan­
tasy Island, and Charlie’s Angels, 
with famed director Bob Clark, 
who has directed such movies as 
Rhinestone and Porky’s I & II, 
and what sort of a movie do you 
get? A bunch of over-sexed teen­
age boys running rampant on a 
cruise liner with Sabrina, Kelly, 
and Chris?
No, sorry. You get the new movie 
Loose Cannons, starring Gene 
Hackman and Dan Aykroyd.
Loose Cannons can be added to 
the lengthy list of comedy-cop- 
action films that includes such 
movies as Dragnet, Beverly Hills 
Cop I & II, and Turner and Hooch. 
The plot centers around Mac Stem 
(played by Hackman) a veteran 
cop whose life has been going 
through a few changes. He has 
just moved out of his Washington 
D.C. apartment into his paneled 
station wagon. He’s also been 
moved from vice squad to homi­
cide and been given a new part­
ner, Ellis Fielding.
Aykroyd, fresh from his serious 
role in Driving Miss Daisy and 
still a bit paunchy, plays Field-
eran cop gets paired up with a 
police forensics expert who goes 
slightly schizophrenic at the slight­
est hint of danger. Starring Gene 
Hackman, Dan Aykroyd, Dom DeLu­
ise, Ronny Cox, and Nancy Travis. 
Directed by Bob Clark. At Showcase 
East Monroeville.
ing, a police forensics officer. He 
is the epitome of a good cop except 
for one small problem — he’s 
slightly schizophrenic. Whenever 
the smallest bit of danger seems 
to come, he launches into one of 
his many alter-egqs, which range 
from Ricky Ricardo to Popeye to 
the Wicked Witch of the West.
The two become involved in a 
multiple-murder case and a con­
spiracy involving a very mysteri­
ous evil German government offi­
cial played by Robert Posky. Posky 
is accompanied by his dedicated 
sidekick/assassin Grimmer, who 
will stop at nothing to protect the 
reputation of his beloved boss.
Also appearing in the film is 
Dom DeLuise as Harry Gutter- 
man, an overweight pom king 
who helps Hackman and Aykroyd
in their investigations into the 
many violent murders that are 
happening in Washington. K 
The film does contain something 
that distinguishes it from the 
regular comedy police movie: a lot 
of action scenes. One of the more 
exciting scenes occurs at the end, 
when the German officer is shot 
and falls through a huge Kodak 
Colorado transparency and into 
Grand Central Station. Another
action-packed scene occurs dur­
ing a chase between a helicopter 
and a train. The train becomes 
trapped in a railroad trestle be­
tween two helicopters. Hackman 
and Aykroyd get into a gunfight 
and then plunge into the violent 
river that rages below.
So, if you are in the mood for a 
little comedy, adventure, and 
schizophrenia, then go see Loose 
Cannons.

Glasnost arrives at the Civic Arena
By LIZZIE MOGEL
Tartan Staffwriter
Where do you find seven-foot bears in 
dresses, bilingual ringmasters, and 
•clowns wearing Cossack boots?
The Moscow Circus, of course.
Comparing the Moscow Circus to its 
“American counterparts would be like 
trying to compare apple pie to triple 
chocolate cake with truffles. The Moscow 
circus is a no-frills, family-type produc­
tion. There aren’t any of the over-hyped 
superlatives that are common in most 
American circuses. The Moscow’s em­
phasis is on the physical prowess and 
daring of the performers. There was 
hardly any mention of how challenging 
the acts were, either because of pure 
modesty or the language barrier.
Unlike the Ringling Brothers—Bamum 
and Bailey circus, where you need at 
least three sets of eyes in order to see 
everything that is going on, the Moscow 
circus is a traditional one ring show. 
;Unfortunately, the size of the Civic Arena 
; detracted from the intimacy truly needed 
for this show to have its full effect. A 
high-wire act doesn’t look nearly as high 
if you’re sitting eye level to it.
As for the show itself, the tone of the 
entire evening was set from the begin­
ning, when the band played both the 
Russian and American national anthems. 
The crowd stood and faced the flags of 
both countries that were hung under­
neath a lit outline of Red Square. Whether 
it was glasnost or simply good P.R., it 
was very effective.
The first act was a high wire act per­
formed without a net. Performing more 
than fifty feet above the ground without 
anything to catch you if you fall may not 
seem like a big deal to jaded audiences. 
However, when one of the performers 
walked the tightrope wrapped in a cloth 
bag from head to foot, that was impres­
sive: The five person pyramid topped by 
a woman in a handstand awed the audi­
ence as well.
The infamous bears, who have infil­
trated the media this past month (even 
to the point where one was a guest VJ on 
MTV) were a bit overrated. There was a 
bear in a tuxedo who did the tango, and 
a bear in a tutu who did the twist. (Or 
was it the watusi? He couldn’t really 
keep the beat.) But, if you’ve seen one 
bear do the can-can, you’ve seen them 
all.
The last act, an equestrian opera of 
sorts, was the most impressive. It began 
with a posse of swordfighting horsemen 
in flowing red capes who chased a white- 
veiled beauty around the ring. It was a 
little too corny when the ringmaster said, 
“O women of the world, throw down your 
veils so that peace will come.” But all was 
forgiven when next two men came in on 
horses (and under horses, and on the 
sides of horses) doing tricks that even 
Buffalo Bill would have gaped at.

The grand finale, another high speed 
horseback chase, followed through with 
the apparent glasnost theme of the eve­
ning. The horsemen produced both 
American and Russian flags and waved 
them while standing on their horses. It 
was truly a spectacular sight and 
summed up the evening perfectly. The 
horsemen, as well as the circus in gen­
eral, received a standing ovation from 
the entire audience. When was the last 
time you saw a circus act cheered off with 
a standing ovation?

Here’s a trick question for 
musical theater fans: What work 
spawned two hit singles and two 
chart-topping albums in the U.S. 
and Britain, three years before it 
was ever seen on stage?
Here’s another one: Can you 
name a new musical that’s al­

London and New York premieres 
— and is currently on a national 
tour, which comes to Heinz Hall 
next Tuesday?
Don’t all shout at once.
If you haven’t yet figured it out, 
the musical in question is Chess.

McAnufFs new touring produc­

cal moves in next week. Tickets, 
which have been on sale since 
early this month, may still be 
available for some performances.
If hype and rumor counted on 
the balance sheets, Chess would 
have long ago qualified as the 
most profitable show of all time. 
From its genesis as a recording 
project initiated by British direc­
tor/lyricist Tim Rice and half of 
the pop group ABBA (Benny 
Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus) in

ber the “One Night In Bangkok” 
music video. Closer to home, a 
song from Chess (“Pity The Child”) 
was performed by junior Ty Tay­
lor in CFA’s Kresge Theatre last 
semester as part of Billy Wilson’s 
I Hear America Singing. Clearly, 
the stuff is pretty pervasive.
Not much is known about
McAnufFs production, including 
the “revisions and additions” to 
the show by Robert Coe, but it 
shares with its predecessors the 
Cold-War vintage plot of an 
American-Soviet championship 
chess match mired in conflicting 
personalities andReagan-erageo- 
politik. Like most of the spy nov­
els of the past fifty years, it may 
seem a bit dated in this new dec­
ade of Communist collapses, but
a set of strong performances froin 
stars Stephen Bogardus (Freddie 
Trumper, the American), Carolee 
Carmello (Florence Vassy), and 
John Herrera (Anatoly Ser- 
gievsky, the Russian) might well 
compensate for any small prob­
lems.
The other aspect that this pro­
duction will share with older 
Chess matches is the high-tech, 
state-of-the-art set. Featuring
projectors, video cameras, and a 
stage floor riddled with 64 light 
boxes (simulating, one might 
guess, a chess board), the shovi 
promises to be a visually interest? 
ing experience.
Chess, presented by the Pitts­
burgh Broadway Series, runs from 
February 27 through March 4 at 
8 pm in Heinz Hall, with weekend 
matinees at 2 pm. Ticket prices 
range from $21 to $36.50.
Dylan Thomas answers the question ‘What makes a poet tick?
— Theatre Review —
U¿94D eY£c4l* n1e-nD S£-nD1¿b A 90-minute, one man show by Welsh actor Bob 
Kingdom, and is based on the poetry, prose, anecdotes, and letters of Dylan Thomas. 
Directed by Anthony Hopkins. Last Friday in Oakland.
By A.S. GOLDMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
The question has been raised before 
and, to the disdain of confounded Eng­
lish scholars and literati everywhere, it 
will be raised again: What makes a poet 
tick? Why has this bookish, masochistic 
creature damned his life to chronicling 
the existence of Grecian pottery and coy 
lovers, only to risk bearing his soul to an 
apathetic or perhaps even hostile pub­
lic? What is the use?
Dylan Thomas was well aware of the 
kind of skepticism that prompts these 
questions — it was part of his own per­
sonality. Thomas’ ostensibly contradic­
tory traits of lyricism and cynicism were 
responsible for a tension that caused 
turmoil (in the form of alcoholism) in his 
personal life, but flowed gracefully into 
his writing. The dichotomy is expertly 
and enchantingly illustrated in Dylan 
Thomas: Return Journey, a one-man 
production which began its tour with an 
exclusive one-night show at the Stephan
Foster Memorial Theatre in Oakland 
last Friday night.
Return Journey, directed by Oscar- 
winner Anthony Hopkins (who was heck­
led to speak louder during his insipid 
introductory speech), is 90 minutes of 
Thomas’ sardonic, sometimes stodgy 
charm — as revealed through his stories 
of childhood and of America — mingled 
with samples of his greatest poetry. Star 
Bob Kingdom grants the spectator the 
opportunity to see two sides of the writer
— personality and poet — juxtaposed 
seemlessly in an inspired portrayal of a 
sometimes less than inspired man.
Kingdom and the show shed light on 
Thomas and on his poetry in a way that 
is both absorbing and sobering. The
audience is exposed to a Thomas at the 
end of the line; he jokes and entertains, 
but it is obvious that this is a man who is 
compelled to look back on his life with a 
sneer. His childhood story of taking a 
debauched roadtrip with his uncle’s eld­
erly entourage is ch arming, but the child’s 
alienation and loneliness cannot be ig­
nored. The same morbid undercurrents 
are evident in Thomas’ frequent refer­
ences to the show as a “word binge,” or a 
series of “lyrical argy bargies,” and to the 
audience as a bunch of intellectual “ec­
centrics.” The words of a man who takes 
pride in his craft? Hmm....
This attitude in -mind, the audience 
must prick up its ears upon hearing so 
uplifting a poem as Thomas’ classic “Do
Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,” 
written to keep his dying father in good 
spirits. His exultant tribute to youth, 
“Fern Hill,” with its celebration of a time 
when Thomas was “green and golden,” 
and “happy as the heart was long,” fur­
ther elucidates Thomas’ personal strife 
late in his life. Kingdom’s readings of 
these poems, and of “And Death Shall 
Have No Dominion,” “Lament,” and 
others is evocative and admirable. Alone 
on the bare stage with merely a podium 
to accompany him, Kingdom makes a 
convincing transformation from actor to 
poet.
If the show has any flaws, it is perhaps 
that it becomes á bit too clever for its own 
good. Kingdom and Hopkins know who 
their audience is, and know that jokes 
alluding to “the barrier of a common 
language” faced by British lecturers in 
America will not be lost on the older, 
sophisticated audience. But, regardless 
of the appropriateness of the material, 
the endless series of quips and allusions 
becomes a test of intellectual stamina,
and the audience may begin to gasp fop 
breath dining the onslaught of educated 
alliteration, punning and gibing. If the 
spectator in question is up to the chal-, 
lenge, though, he will be rewarded for hi^ 
endurance with a night of sharp-witted 
theatre.
The Return Journey is a great achieve-! 
ment. It is an entertaining and enligtit* 
ening opportunity to observe the poet in 
a casual atmosphere, and to see how life 
corresponds- with the art. Probability 
forces one to assume that somewhere ig 
the audience, someone was asking those 
dreary questions: Why should we care 
and why did Thomas care? Thomas 
answers for himself with “In My Craft Or 
Sullen Art.” To the Philistine and to 
himself perhaps, he offers this explanau 
tion:
I labour by singing light
Not for ambition or bread
Or the strut and trade of charms
On the ivory stages
But for the common wages
Of their most secret heart.

The jazz scene 
heats up in February
ACCENT ON JAZZ
by Jeff Muller
If you love the local jazz scene 
but are desperately in want of 
something more, then I have 
good news for you. There will be 
two outstanding shows within 
the next month and a half.
Next Saturday, the legendary 
Art Ensemble of Chicago will 
make its Pittsburgh debut at 8 
pm at the Fulton. Presented by 
the Pittsburgh New Music En­
semble, this band has been ac­
claimed as “one of the most ad­
venturous, creative, and down­
right enjoyable groups in all of 
jazz” by the Houston Post.
Playing “Great Black Music: 
Ancient to the Future” and 
dressed in African robes and 
facepaint, the five-member 
group weaves humor, mime, 
magic, special effects, dance, 
poetry, and a large assortment 
of acoustic instruments from 
around the world into its mes­
merizing performances.
The group was formedin 1967 
by trumpeter Lester Bowie, reed 
players Roscoe Mitchell and Jo­
seph Jarman, and bassist Ma- 
lachi Favors Maghostut. While 
living in Paris in 1970, they 
were joined by drummer/per­
cussionist Famodou Don Moye. 
The past 20 years has codified 
the chemistry between these in­
dividuals, leading to their status 
as one of the most exciting and 
unpredictable ensembles in the 
world.
Moving away from the en­
semble and toward the soloist, 
theBenedum Center is present- 
ingits Jazz Explosion on Satur­
day, March 24 at 8 pm. This 
show will feature the immense 
talents of trumpeter Freddie 
Hubbard, saxophonist Stanley
Turrentine, keyboardist Lon­
nie Liston Smith, and vocalist 
Jean Came, each performing a 
solo set with the Jazz Explo­
sion band, and, “if the mood is 
right,” they might join forces 
for an encore.
Recently voted the best trum­
pet player in the world by the 
readers ofDownbeat Magazine, 
Hubbard is definitely one of 
the most exciting soloists that 
his instrument has ever seen. 
Having developed his unique 
style in the 1960s, Hubbard 
has never shied away from 
change, as is evidenced in his 
most recent recordings.
Turrentine, a native Pitts­
burgher, has remained for 
years one of the most under­
rated performers in the jazz 
world. His fluid lines on the 
tenor sax have inspired young 
players for years.
One of the great organists on 
the jazz scene today, Smith 
began his career with legends 
such as Miles Davis and Art 
Blakey. Since then he has 
moved on and established 
himself as a leader with his 
own band, the Cosmic Echoes. 
His latest album, Silhouettes, 
displays his eclectic blend of 
jazz, funk, fusion, and pop.
Came, who developed her 
immense talent singing in 
church choirs, had the dubious 
honor of being the last vocalist 
to work with Duke Ellington. 
Though she has performed with 
a legend such as Ellington, she 
is probably better known for 
her recordings with pop super­
groups Earth, Wind, and Fire 
and the Temptations.
With so much talent coming 
into the city, I’m sure you must 
be having a hard time deciding 
which show to attend, so take 
my advice and see both. But if 
you have to choose, then make 
sure to see the Art Ensemble of 
Chicago, because there’s noth­
ing else in the world like it.

nized. It was just that they moved 
with perfect ease and absolute 
grace and they did it like they did 
I everything else: just having fun 
with each other. One thing Black 
Mambazo do not do is take them- 
| selves too seriously.
The high point of the concert 
came when the band performed 
! “Amaphiko Okundiza” (Wings to 
Ply), about “the day-they met Paul 
Simon.” Shabalala and friends 
went into the audience and 
brought back about half a dozen 
women — Asian women, white 
women, black women, even the 
little girl sitting next to me — to 
join them for the chorus.
“I love you baby, I love you.
"I love you baby, I love you” 
Tears came to my eyes to see all 
these people, up on stage like old 
friends, singing together. Not 
being embarrassed, not conscious 
of anything but the music and the 
love; just singing together.
“I love you baby, I love you.
“I love you baby, I love you.“
As of Thursday night, Nelson 
Mandela had been free less than 
one week. One of the last songs 
Black Mambazo played was one 
called “Rejoice.”
“This week we are celebrating, 
happy about the good news from 
South Africa....” We didn’t give 
him a chance to finish. We inter­
rupted him with all the applause 
and admiration and excitement 
and pure joy we could muster. We 
couldn’t sing along—not in Zulu, 
anyway — but we rejoiced right 
along with them.
Where were you whenyou heard 
the news of Nelson Mandela’s 
Please?
‘We were at Sag Harbor [a col- 
kge in Long Island]. ...We were in 
°ur hotel room and when we heard.
We got a call from South Africa 
and we started singing and danc­
ing in the hotel. We were singing 
and dancing all night with the 
people in the hotel....”
Then, all too soon, they got down 
from the stage, and started back 
from where they came, waving 
and laughing again in the spot­
light.
But we hadn’t had enough. We 
stood up and clapped after them, 
stood and clapped until our hands 
burned.
And back they came, this time 
in the dark, dressed in coal miner’s 
gear and hardhats with lights on 
the front. They sang of the lives of 
the coal miners in South Africa— 
of men separated from their fami­
lies for months on end, down in 
the lonely mines — with humor 
and sensitivity and no bitterness.
“Our purpose is to remind people 
of their culture. They are just 
running away from their culture, 
singing other music.... ” 
Ladysmith Black Mambazo 
treated us to the most energy- 
filled, leg-kicking, foot-stomping, 
sweat-flying dance marathon of 
our lives. I thought it was never 
going to end. Then, one by one, 
they left the stage again, still 
singing, until only one man re­
mained, singing his low, sweet, 
chirping bassline goodbye.“Peace. Peace. Peace” 
Shabalala told me that Ladys­
mith Black Mambazo would come 
back to CMU again if we only 
invite them....
AB Concerts — listen, up and 
listen good: Get them back again 
and do it before I graduate. Ev­
eryone else: Shame on you if you 
missed the best concert of the 
year. Get down to the record store 
pronto and buy yourself a Ladys­
mith Black Mambazo album.

very different styles, especially 
since I’m in Theme and Variations, 
which is Balanchine, a classical 
work, and in the next ballet 20 
minutes later I’m performing 
weird, contemporary work. It is 
refreshing.”
Annegarn remarks on the dra­
matic change in rehearsal de­
mands now that he is at PBT. “We 
rehearse 4-6 weeks for two per­
formances, whereas at London 
City Ballet we would rehearse 4- 
6 weeks and maybe do 100 per­
formances of a ballet.
“It’s more important to get eve­
rything right before you get on 
stage with this company. Hope­
fully we get a higher quality per­
formance because of it.”
Annegarn sports an impressive 
dance repertoire. He has per­
formed in full-length ballets 
including Swan Lake, Coppelia, 
and La Sylphide, as well as hav­
ing danced lead roles in Peter 
Darrell’s Othello and Andre 
Prokovsky’s Romeo and Juliet. 
His partners have included Gal­
ina Samsova and Pippa Wilde of 
the Royal Ballet and Denise 
Veldton of the Royal Swedish 
Ballet.
Can such an accomplished per­
former still get stage fright? “To a 
certain degree, every time I go 
onstage,” admits Annegarn with 
an endearing smile. “I get a few 
butterflies. I tend to enjoy them 
more now than I used to. If I 
haven’t prepared well, I get fright­
ened. If I have prepared, I tell 
myself, ‘You’ve done what you 
can.’ A lot of dancing is simply 
doingyour homework— knowing 
your music, knowing your role.
“But ballet is a bit of a gamble. 
You get out there and it’s got to 
work that night. Doesn’t matter if 
it worked 10 times in the studio,
you’ve got to do it when the cur­
tain comes up and everyone’s sit­
ting there watching.”
What It All Means
When asked about the meaning 
of his career, Annegarn speaks 
with a quiet determination in his 
voice.
“Dancing is my job, it’s my liv­
ing, my income, so it’s important 
in that respect. But also, which I 
think is tme of most people’s jobs, 
but more so in dancing, is that it’s 
a form of self-expression and how 
you see yourself. I think everyone 
feels good when they do their job 
well.
“It’s the same with me. I like to 
think of myself as a good dancer; 
that makes me feel good. It’s 
important to me. I really do enjoy 
dancing and I’m pretty lucky in 
that respect in that it’s not really 
hard work to me. I can actually 
enjoy doing it, though it is also 
challenging.
“There are some mornings when 
you get up and say, T don’t want 
to do this.’ Your joints are aching 
and you’re old before your time. 
Dancing is not very good for you. 
A principal male dancer wrecks 
his body. Even now when I sit I 
can feel it —•” he massages his 
wrists and ankles “— ankle, knee, 
and back problems. They’re going 
to plague me later on. But you’ve 
got to push your technique, push 
your body beyond what would be 
healthy.... Today’s people expect 
a certain level of technique, which 
you just have to get to satisfy an 
audience.”
“In the short-term it’s definitely 
worth it. But then, I’ll have ar­
thritis when I’m 60,” Annegarn 
grins wildly. “But I don’t think 
about that!”
The city of Pittsburgh and the
4ERIsEy O8NvpuAymvsV8RCoy ,NRRofV8HI dAiiCR eICAR8C
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre have 
proven to be important steps for 
Annegarn. Riding high on the 
critical acclaim he’s received, 
dance is no longer a hobby to him 
— it’s given his life order and 
purpose.
“I’m really happy with the way 
things have been going,” says 
Annegarn. He makes a sweeping 
gesture toward a bag on the floor. 
“There’s a contract waiting for me 
in there. I’m going to be [at PBT] 
next season, and I feel I’m mak­
ing progress. I’m enjoying Pitts­
burgh; I’m having a good time.”
With all the success he’s 
achieved to date, does he feel that 
he’s, in a sense, made it? “I’m 26,
and probably until I’m 36 I’ll still 
be hoping to do one better. If you 
suddenly think, ‘I’ve made it,’ you 
limit yourself. Why? It’s wonder^ 
ful achieving different goals — 
then you s et new ones.... It doesnS 
happen very often that I, or,I 
think any dancer, really feels 
satisfied'with what they’ve done. 
The one or two times when yoji 
feel a job well done, it’s great, it’s 
the best feeling.
“As long as I’m getting benefits 
out of being at a place, which I am 
now, I’m going to stay around. As 
long as I feel happy with a place, 
and as long as the people there 
are happy with me, it’s wonder^ 
ful.”

We are all capable, given the 
right circumstances, of the most 
heinous and cold blooded murder. 
This is the dominating theme in 
Canadian playwright Sharon 
Pollock’s Blood Relations. After 
seeing the expression on my 
girlfriend’s face when I told her 
that we were going to see a play 
about an ax-murderess on 
Valentine’s Day, I had no trouble 
at all believing it. Blood Relations 
opened last Wednesday night at 
the University of Pittsburgh.
In 1892, Lizzie Borden was 
accused, arrested, and later ac­
quitted of the brutal murders of 
her mother and father. The play 
is set ten years after the murders 
and Lizzie now owns and oper­
ates her father’s farm.
An actress friend of hers is vis­
iting and she reveals to Lizzie 
that she is obsessed with the tmth 
about the murders. “Did you do 
it?” she repeatedly asks. Lizzie 
decides to show her, and in a 
dream like sequence, the Actress 
becomes Lizzie Borden while 
Lizzie roleplays as the family 
maid, Bridget, who worked for 
the Bordens at the time of the 
murders. With the real Lizzie 
functioning in a dual role as the 
maid and a pseudo-narrator, the 
Actress is transported back in 
time, and lives the days just prior 
to the murders as a distraught
— Theatre Review —
d9££U n194eT£Dlb A thriller which looks into the mind of famed axe- 
murderess Lizzie Borden. Written by Sharon Pollock, directed by Peter 
Harrigan and featuring Anne Louise Bannon, Hazel Carr Leroy, and 
Michael Dowd. At the studio theatre, sub-basement of The Cathedral of 
Learning, Oakland. Performances through Friday. Call 642-PLAY for

and confused Lizzie Borden.
Lizzie’s despair and confusion 
is given visible substance by the 
excellent lighting, sound and set 
design of Mrk Mrkvicka. The 
sinister sounding background 
music combined with Mrkvicka’s 
set made even the most innocent 
character interaction seem dark 
and foreboding.
In addition, the small and inti­
mate studio theatre was ex­
tremely hot and stuffy. Thanks to 
a combination of these factors, 
there was a near palpable air of 
tension in the room that added to 
the power of the production.
Fine performances were turned 
out by nearly every member of 
the cast. A particularly good job 
was done by Michael Dowd who 
played Mr. Borden. Thanks, in 
part, to his performance, the rela­
tionship between Lizzie and her 
father was believable. The other 
half of the credit goes to Anne 
Louis Bannon in the role of the 
Actress, who was also playing 
Lizzie. Her performance was ex­
tremely powerful, for as she be­
came more immersed in her role
as Lizzie, she lost many of the 
characteristics she showed as the 
Actress.
The only negative criticism that 
I have deals with the relationship 
between the Actress and Lizzie, 
who was played by Hazel Carr 
Leroy. Never was it believable 
that these two characters had any 
feelings at all for each other. It 
was suggested that they were 
more than just friends, but their 
relationship never found the sin­
cerity that was displayed between 
Bannon and Dowd. However, this 
minor problem was quickly over­
shadowed by the strength of their 
individual performances.
I would guess that writer Pol­
lock is an ardent feminist. Under 
the surface, Blood Relations is a 
well done commentary about the 
status of women in the late nine­
teenth century. Through Lizzie, 
Pollock shows us what few rights
women actually possessed. Lizzie 
is reminded several times 
throughout the dream sequence 
that she is qualified to do nothiiig 
but find a husband. But Lizzie is 
not a typical lady of the ’90s. Sh’d 
wants the rights of a man. Sh<§ 
wants to make her own decisions? 
Most of all, however, Lizzie wants 
to own the farm. If she could own; 
the farm, she would finally haV^ 
the money and power she has 
longed for all her life.
As the play continues, Lizzie’s 
father decides to will it to her 
step-mother and leave only k 
monthly allowance for Lizzie and- 
her sister. Lizzie always felt like1 
a trapped animal on the farm1. 
Now she is beginning to feel cor­
nered and threatened. She has to' 
stop him before he makes out a 
will. We suspect how the reap 
Lizzie stopped him, but this is is1 
a dream with the Actress as Liz- \ 
zie. What will she do? What would { 
you do? This is the question that 
Pollock asks of the viewer.
After a late supper and a par­
ticularly mushy Valentine’s Day 
card, my girlfriend eventually 
admitted that she enjoyed her­
self. If you enjoy an excellent psy­
chological thriller, it is definitely 
worth seeing.

Joe Bob evades reporters during his World Tour
Now that we’re three weeks into 
the Joe Bob Briggs World Tour, 
reporters surge into the airport 
everywhere I stop, demanding 
interviews, snapping pictures, 
trying to pry into my private life. 
Unfortunately for them, I don’t 
tuse the airport. I’m driving around 
in my car. So mostly they just get 
pictures of beat-up luggage and 
guys carrying lap-top computers.
So far, I’ve been lucky. There 
have only been a few life-threat­
ening situations. Like the day I 
went out in public in Petaluma, 
Calif., and the streets were sud­
denly snarled and clogged by 
rubber-necking chicken farmers 
with bad complexions. I narrowly 
escaped by vaulting into the bed 
df a 67 Chevy pickup and min­
gling with farm animals, includ­
ing a one-eyed Jersey heifer 
named Svengali that turned out 
to be the 4-H project of Becky 
Heffeman, a 14 year-old third 
grader.
I don’twanna dwell on the nasty 
Aspects of being a big-deal inter­
national celebrity, though. There 
will always be a few mean-spir- 
ited people, like the 900 people 
who threw actual projectiles at 
the New York concert. Or the critic 
ijn Santa Rosa, Calif., who was so 
wishy-washy about the show, 
couldn’t make up his mind about 
exactly what he thought, and so 
he wrote an article headlined “Joe 
Bob, Go Back To Writing!” Those 
wacky critics! No, I prefer to dwell
JOE BOB BRIGGS GOES 
TO THE DRIVE IN
by Joe Bob Bi'iggs
on the people who don’t actually 
get hostile when I’m on stage. 
Both of them.
There are so many wonderful 
positive experiences. Like the 
morning I was on the radio sta­
tion in Santa Rosa and Pat 
Paulsen called up from Guam. 
Pat was doing comedy at the 
Guam Hilton, addressing the 
Guam Legislature, and going 
around Guam campaigning for 
Governor of Guam. Except on the 
night of his first performance, the 
real ex-governor of Guam 
wrapped himself in the Guam flag 
and blew his brains out. This put 
kind of a damper on Pat’s act, and 
so he called up to say, “Joe Bob, 
you think your material is in bad 
taste....”
Or how about the time I spent 
hanging out backstage at The 
Tonight Show with Dennis “I 
Don’t Do Drugs Anymore” Hop­
per? It was as though God was 
saying, “Joe Bob, you think your 
brain is messed up....”
And then, of course, there was 
the Great American Music Hall 
in San Francisco, which is right 
next door to the famous Mitchell 
Brothers porno palace where 
Marilyn Chambers got arrested 
one time, in a neighborhood so 
perverted that they have triple­
reverse transvestite hookers, 
which is she-males that have had 
transsexual surgery and then 
changed their mind and had the 
surgery reversed but they still 
dress up like women even though 
they only do sex with gay cross- 
dressing bullriders.
In other words, my kind of 
neighborhood!
And the chicken farmers from 
Petaluma showed up! They 
thought my act included some­
thing nasty with farm animals.
God, I love showbiz.
Speaking of people who do the 
same act over and over again, 
Larry Buchanan is the guy I was 
talking about last month who does 
all the conspiracy movies, like 
Goodnight, Sweet Marilyn, the 
movie that proves how Marilyn 
Monroe was nubbed out by the 
Mafia, the FBI, the CIA and 
Castro, and Naughty Dallas, the 
story of how the FBI killed Jack 
Ruby, and so evidently I made the 
guy so famous that they’re releas­
ing, for the first time ever, his 
1984 film Beyond the Doors, the 
movie that reveals how Richard 
Nixon manipulated a “very elite, 
very illegal and well-funded
command of special agents” to 
assassinate Jimi Hendrix, Janis 
Joplin, and Jim Morrison. Only 
they didn’t get to Jim Morrison in 
time. What really happened is 
that Jim Morrison faked his death 
in 1971, became a Catholic monk, 
moved into a monastery in Spain, 
died in 1974, and was buried in an 
unmarked grave.
I mean, think about it. We’ve 
got a motive, don’t we?
The motive for assassinating 
these people was ... er ... uh ... 
well, actually, the motive is not 
too clear from the flick. But it’s 
something about how they were 
the “pied pipers of rock” and so 
they were causing the riots in 
Watts and the anti-war protests 
and so, obviously, they had to die. 
There’s a whole lot of balding guys 
in grey suits sitting behind desks 
making phone calls in this movie, 
saying stuff to one another like 
“Could I have the coordinates on 
Code Name Vanishing Species?”
The most amazing thing about 
this movie is they really did find 
three actors who look like Jimi, 
Janis and Jim, and they can sing 
and play guitar — sort of. Unfor­
tunately, the guy they got to play 
J. Edgar Hoover looks like Den­
nis Hopper after a three-day 
drunk.

Journeyman extolls his virtues on yet another album
vsV8RCoy nCP8NoC nCvs87o
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor
Top forty. Does that phrase strike 
terror in your very heart? Do the 
names Milli Vanilli, Jodi Watley, New 
Kids on the Block, and The Boys make 
you cringe with terror? Are you one of 
those people that hope that some old 
band will reform and release another 
album? Was your favorite album of
1989 Dark Side of the Moon?
Never fear. There are several rock 
artists that have been around for many 
years that are still putting out good 
albums. One of them just released his 
latest album in a long career. A DJ 
from the Washington D.C. area calls 
him the Terminally Hip One, and he 
is.
Eric Clapton, who left the Yardbirds 
because they were starting to put out 
pop music instead of the blues, has 
come out with his latest solo album, 
Journeyman, which has hit the pop 
charts.
The title of the album does seem to 
fit Clapton. Ajoumeymanis someone 
who has learned a trade and works for 
someone else. Clapton has definitely

¡¡¡¡ S£-nD1¿c4Db By Eric Clap­
ton. Reprise Records.
learned his trade and no one else can 
do what he does as well.
Fortunately, this album can’t be 
categorized as pop. The album is 
standard Clapton, which is the same 
as saying a violin is standard Stradi- 
varius. The first song, “Pretending,” 
is a classic Clapton song, starting 
with some playful piano which leads 
right into Clapton on the guitar. This 
song is reminiscent of his earlier 
album, August.
The second song of the album, 
“Anything For Your Love,” features 
two of the greatest guitarists of all 
time; however, don’t expect extraor­
dinary guitar parts. The playing is 
great, it’s just that the parts weren’t 
written for two greats like Clapton 
and Robert Cray to show their tal­
ents. “Anything For Your Love” is a 
slow Clapton tune, on which I think 
Cray’s otherwise excellent playing is 
wasted. Anyhow, Cray does play on
several other songs on the album, so 
his presence is not totally eclipsed by 
the writing.
The second guest star of the album 
shows up in the third song, another 
rocking tune, “Bad Love.” If you lis­
ten closely to the chorus you can hear 
the voice of a baldy, pudgy English 
drummer. That’s right, Phil Collins 
sings the chorus and plays the drums 
on the tune.
In addition to the original material 
written for Journeyman, Clapton also 
does some extraordinary covers. 
“Hard Times,” a 1961 Ray Charles 
tune, is sung by Clapton in almost 
the same voice that Charles used 
over 15 years ago. “Hard Times” is a 
classic example of the blues with 
which Clapton grew up and which 
also influenced him to become what 
he is today — the best white blues- 
man that ever lived.
Clapton also remakes the classic 
Elvis tune, “Hound Dog.” It is not as 
good as the original, but it is an ex­
ception to the rest of the album. You 
would have thought that Clapton 
could have done a better job of re­
making this one song, but he didn’t.
One of the problems here is that people 
often look up to singers of Clapton’s 
caliber and think that they are gods of 
goddesses. After listening to this al­
bum, I can easily attribute Clapton’fe 
imperfect remake of “Hound Dog” to 
his being only human.
On the second side of the album, 
“Run So Far” appears. The song starts 
just like any other Traveling Wilburys 
song. Why would it sound that waj{, 
you ask. Well, anything that George 
Harrison writes these days sounds likfc 
the Traveling Wilburys. Yes, Harrison 
did write and perform on the song and 
it sounds pretty good. I also like the 
Wilburys, even though most of their 
songs have the same sound to them.;
One of the great things about thi;s 
album is that you can listen to it on tw;o 
different levels. You can pop the al­
bum into your stereo and crank it up 
(not Van Halen level, but close) or you 
can put it on a quiet sort of level and it 
sounds just as good.
All in all, the album is excellent. The 
only thing that I regret is that I bought 
it on tape and not on CD. Oh well, 
maybe you will have more common 
sense than I.
Imagine that someone offered you $13,000 and a 
year after you graduate to study something that 
has interested you for a long time, that excites you 
a lot, and that would require travel abroad in one or 
more cultures different from your own.
Would that interest you, and what would you do?
A Watson Fellowship can make this possible for you.
The College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University has become one of a select group of 55 schools who are eligible to nomiminate students for 
Thomas J. Watson Fellowships. The Watson Fellowship program seeks to enable college graduates of unusual promise to engage in a year of independent study and travel abroad following 
graduation.
Approximately 75 Watson Fellows are selected every year, and receive grants ranging from $13,000 to $18,000for travel and study abroad during the year following their college graduation. 
Eligible students include H81SS students, and non-HSlSS students with an H81SS double major or minor. Preliminary applications due in early October of the senior year. Nominees 
are selected in late October, and interviewed by the Foundation Director in the early Spring of the senior year.
Come to a special informational meeting on Wednesday, February 21, at 4:30 pm, in the Adamson Wing. Present at this meeting will 
be Mr. Steven Licata, Executive Director of the Watson Foundation, who will be on campus that day to interview our four nominees for 
1990-1991 Watson Fellowships.

BEHIND EVERY 
GREAT IDEA 
THERE’S SOMEONE 
WHO SAYS IT WON’T WORK.
Thursday, February 22
Cocoanuts
This screen debut of the legendary Marx Brothers 
was filmed during the Golden Age of Cinema, when 
audiovisual technology had just finished wiping off 
the last traces of amnionic fluid, and the average 
actor seemed about as sincere as a safety belt in a 
torture chamber. Cocoanuts is blighted by bland, 
uninspiring music and a tissue-paper plot, but 
Groucho et al. have some hilarious scenes that grant 
it a perfunctory classic status. The resulting esca­
pades seem as delightful and wistfully transient as 
water fountains in the Sahara. You may have to 
endure some cheese before being able to savor Coco­
anuts’ comedic core, but it’s worth the wait.

Casualties of War
Despite his boyish looks, Michael J. Fox isn’t sev­
enteen, and he takes on the lead in this serious, grip­
ping, and somewhat brutal drama in order to prove it. 
The results are surprisingly effective. When his fel­
low soldiers in the depths of Vietnam ventilate their 
frenzy by beating and molesting a young native girl, 
one clean cut and conscientious soldier decides that 
all is not spiffy, and decides to rebel against the 
dehumanizing and barbaric actions of his platoon. 
The film is provocative and involving, if you can 
ignore the nagging archetype set by Fox’s prior roles.

Do The Right Thing
Given the topic’s propagation and commercial 
exploitation during the last ten years, another movie 
about racial discord seems as appealing as the pros­
pect of a Vanilli solo album, but Spike Lee’s most 
recent bundle of cinematic controversy is both power­
ful and entertaining. It presents the material in a 
refreshing, perceptive style. Lee himself stars as the 
movie’s protagonist, a pizza delivery boy in the midst 
of a Brooklyn community with about as much rkcial 
serenity as an invasion scene from War of the Worlds. 
The plot centers around a successful white-run pizza 
shop that sets off an outbreak of hostilities. Those 
ravenous for films billed as “culturally significant” 
will have a heyday. By all means, shell out the dollar.

Murder on the Orient Express
Agatha Christie’s classic novel wends its way onto 
the silver screen at last, bringing with it a dignified 
cast including the likes of Sean Connery, Ingrid 
Bergman, Anthony Perkins, and Vanessa Redgrave. 
A British import, Murder on the Orient Express is set 
in the 1930s and depicts the efforts of the legendary 
detective Hercule Poirot (portrayed by Albert Fin­
ney) to unravel the layers of mystery from a murder 
whose suspects are all aboard the same train. The 
movie drags on for diehard fans of Ramboesque vio­
lence and destruction, but provides an entertaining 
dosage of intrigue for bleary-eyed end-of-the-week- 
end students with inclinations towards mysteries.

Unplanned pregnancy happens to students, 
and a lot of us, male and female, have to deal with 
it. It can happen to your friends — or to you.
A lot of students have sex without birth 
control. It's a fact. Even if people use birth control, 
they might not use it correctly. Statistics show that 
younger people are more likely to use birth control 
incorrectly. Accidents happen.
So then comes the hardest part — deciding 
what to do, who to turn to, who to tell. There are a 
lot of different options, and making the right 
choice involves different choices for everyone.
The main concern for a young pregnant 
woman, according to Lucy Spruill of Pittsburgh's 
Roselia Center, is how the pregnancy is going to 
affect important relationships. Spruill, who has 20 
years of experience working with single pregnant 
women, emphasizes that a pregnant woman 
should consider how her close friends, family, and 
boyfriend are going to react, should she choose to 
tell them. She also has to consider how professors, 
employers, and people walking by on the street 
will react to someone so young being pregnant.
Although the Roselia Center follows the social 
teachings of the Catholic Church, other organiza­
tions offer termination of pregnancy as an option. 
There is a lot of controversy surrounding abortion,
‘ and when a woman chooses to have an abortion, 
the controversy — and the decision — are things 
she will have to live with for the rest of her life.
Attitudes towards single parenting and young 
pregnancy have changed drastically over the past 
several years. Out of young women who choose to 
have their children, a smaller percentage are giving 
the child up for adoption. There is more help for 
single parents, financially and medically. 'That's 
all for the good," says Spruill, "because tragic 
things happen the other way."
In the past, many women who gave up their 
babies felt that they had no other choice, because 
there was a terrible stigma of having a child and 
being single. No longer, however, is there a sepa­
rate birth certificate for "illegitimate" children. 
"Children are just children," says Spruill.
There are many people out there for a pregnant 
woman to turn to. A lot of different groups can 
help her make a decision, whether it be terminating 
the pregnancy or having the baby. Unfortunately, a 
lot of young women have to face the pressures of 
not being able to tell their families and others — 
they're afraid of being rejected because it's consid­
ered unacceptable to be young, unwed, and 
pregnant.
But things are looking up. Young, single 
mothers are increasingly being accepted by society. 
It's a sign many greet with joy. "I don't think a 
more supportive atmosphere has led to more 
pregnancy," says Spruill. "I just think it's led to less 
grief."
Women aren't alone in being affected by 
unplanned pregnancy, however. A man who's told 
he's a potential father has concerns and feelings 
also. It can be intimidating for a young man to deal 
with impending fatherthood — most agencies are 
thought of as women's services, and men can feel 
left out or helpless. Counselors at the Roselia 
Center say that that perception isn't true — preg­
nancy experts try to involve the baby's father 
whenever possible.
Depending on who you talk to, the problem of 
unplanned pregnancy is seen differently. Some see 
it as a moral issue — they say we should try to stop 
unmarried people from having sex at a young age. 
Others see a problem in the fact that many young 
people fail to use contraceptives correctly, if they 
use them at all. Still others stress the detrimental 
medical, social, and economic consequences for 
young mothers. "Something we know about 
women psychologically is that they are very 
dependent on relationships, and they are not 
always socialized to make choices that are in their 
self-interests," says Spruill.
Whatever the problem, the fact is that many 
students have to deal with unplanned pregnancy. 
They need to know what options are available.

The international outlook: U.S. birthrate high
Why are the adolescent fertility and abortion 
rates much higher in the U.S. than in other coun­
tries with similar socio-economic backgrounds? 
What preventive strategies for lowering these rates 
do other countries practice that the U.S. should 
learn and follow?
As Family Planning Perspectives reports, "[U.S.] 
teenagers ... have inherited the worst of all possible 
worlds...Movies, music, radio, and TV tell them 
that sex is romantic, exciting, titillating...yet, at the 
same time, young people get the message that 
good girls should say no/' However, the problem 
is far more complex than just blaming the cause of 
high rates on Days of Our Lives, 91/2 Weeks, or Salt- 
n-Pepper's Push It. Before we begin to analyze 
other causes for high fertility rates within the U.S. 
compared to lower rates of other countries, it is im­
portant not to distort the overall picture.
On the whole, "adolescent fertility rates have 
been declining in the United States, as they have in 
virtually all the countries of western and northern 
Europe," according to a report in Family Planning 
Perspectives. On the other hand, they also acknowl­
edge that "teenage fertility is still considerably 
higher in the U.S. than in the great majority of 
other developed countries."
First of all, many people are tempted to blame 
the high adolescent fertility rate solely on the 
uneducated and poor. Although this generalization 
is somewhat accurate, the problem is much 
broader than that. What separates the U.S. from 
other countries on a larger scale?
Generally, what stands out is our culture, a 
mixture of various races. Statistics have shown 
that teenage blacks and hispanics have higher birth 
rates than whites. The future projection is that the 
birth rates of whites are expected to decrease 
sharply while rates among other races increase. In 
addition, the large size of the U.S. makes it difficult 
to discuss the issues and come to an easy consen­
sus as a group.
A 37-Country Analysis undertaken by The 
Alan Guttmacher research organization is more 
specific in terms of showing how cultural views 
can influence the adolescent fertility rates in 
various nations. This study compared the U.S. 
with other developed countries with similar 
situations (e,g. Great Britain, Japan, France, Can­
ada, Greece, Italy and the U.S.S.R.). The analysis 
was based on a widely distributed questionnaire 
sent to the public affairs officer of the American 
Embassy in each foreign country as well as the 
family planning organizations and other related 
agencies.
The results indicated that the U.S. followed a 
general pattern for high fertility rates in which the 
U.S. was "less open about sexual matters than most 
countries with low teenage birth rates."
The prominence of religious fundamentalism 
in the U.S. is partly responsible for American 
sexual discretion. It is also partially to blame for 
the relative innacessibility of contraception to 
American youth. Other countries with much lower 
fertility rates have official sex education programs 
which are compulsory throughout grade school, 
better usage of contraceptives, easy access to 
medical services and health programs, and little or 
no cost for these services.
The willingness and cooperation of the govern­
ment, which has great "authoritative" power, 
plays a big factor in terms of leading the general 
views of society. Foreign govemmments chose to 
focus on the prevention of unwanted births instead 
of the "morals" of unwanted childbirth. Also, "it is 
noteworthy that government subsidy of abortions 
is not associated with teenage fertility." Statistics 
have proven that where the birth rates are low, so 
are the abortion rates.
The clinics and medical services provided in 
the U.S. are "reasonably accessible" but often have 
the image of being services intended for the poor. 
This image causes teenagers to avoid such clinics 
or services because they feel that these places are 
for welfare clients.
The U.S. can help decrease its high adolescent 
fertility rate by following a set of guidelines used 
by other countries. Such actions include publiciz­
ing the availability of contraceptives through ad­
vertisement and media, "upgrading" the image of 
family planning centers, providing easy access to 
contraceptives and services, and providing confi­
dential healthcare and treatment. Moreover,the 
U.S. should be more informative about abortion 
and never leave the adolescent in the dark again.

Why students don’t use birth control
Over a third of all Americans do not use birth 
control when they lose their virginity, according to 
statistics compiled by Family Planning Perspectives 
magazine.
Only 62 percent of those surveyed reported 
that they had used birth control during their first 
time having sex. When this statistic is combined 
with another one — that over 70 percent of people 
aged 20 or more have already had sex — it points 
to an alarming situation for our age group.
In another survey of adolescents, the reason re­
spondents most often gave for not using birth con­
trol during their most recent sexual encounter was 
that they "did not expect to have sex."
These and other studies show that most teens 
are never given the right advice about sex, if they 
are given any advice at all. Lack of information 
may be one cause for high contraception failure 
rates until the age of about thirty.
When asked what kind of advice about sex 
was given from their parents, most CMU students 
replied that "sex was forbidden and they were 
advised to wait until 'ready7 or 'until the time was 
right.'"
Other students said that sex was "just never 
discussed at home." The remaining few said that 
their parents had openly discussed sex with them 
during the preteen years. At the vulnerable and
awkward ages of 12-15, most teenagers feel embar­
rassed or ashamed to discuss sex, especially with 
their parents. Instead, teens look to the media, 
peers, and personal experience.
I gathered a group of CMU freshmen guys to 
ask them about their experiences with sex:
Q: From whom or where did you learn what you 
know now about sex?
1st: Basically, my parents didn't tell me any­
thing, and I was kind of embarrassed to ask 
because I thought it was wrong for me to be 
interested in sex. I guess I was taught mostly from 
experience and from friends.
2nd; Yeah, I also learned from friends and 
through "trial and error."
3rd: Not me. My mother works for Planned 
Parenthood so she told me everything. I usually 
refer to her as the "Condom Queen"; she's always 
sending them to me at school.
Q: Did any of you have a sexual education 
class in high school?
All: Yeah, but it was only part of a health 
class .The teacher discussed sex for about two 
weeks before we moved on to the next topic and 
birth control was never discussed. I really didn't 
learn anything from that class.
Q: Were any of you prepared with birth control the 
first time you had sexual intercourse?
1st: No, I wasn't prepared, but we did it any­
way by using withdrawal.
3rd: I was prepared with a condom (which my 
mother had sent to me).
2nd & 4th: yeah, I had a condom with me the 
first time.
Q: For those of you who were in long-term relation­
ships, what types of birth control did you use?
1st: I was in a relationship for three years but 
we always used withdrawal; we didn't have sex 
very often, though.
3rd: During a six-month relationship we used 
condoms at first until my girlfriend decided to go 
on the pill.
4th: My girlfriend and I also started with con­
doms and then she went on and off the pill; we 
went out for about four months.
Next, I talked individually to a few CMU 
women who told me about their experiences with 
sex and birth control.
One senior discussed the first time she had sex: 
"I was sixteen and didn't know what I was doing; 
neither did he. We were really irresponsible and 
didn't use any method of birth control. I had felt 
pressured and later I felt guilty because none of my 
friends had had sex; I was the only one. Now I 
always use condoms. I've never tried any other 
type of birth control."
Another senior replied that she was 18 her first 
time, and she and her boyfriend had used a con­
dom. When asked what other types of birth control 
she has used, she replied, "I have always used 
condoms and occasionally the withdrawal method.
I have been in a long-term relationship for nearly 
one year and I began using birth control pills five 
months ago."
Is she happy with the pill? "At first I wasn't 
sure if I wanted to use pills because I was afraid of 
gaining weight. I talked to many friends who were 
on the pill and each gave me a different answer. I 
discussed my dilemma over and over again with 
my boyfriend, who wanted me to go on the pill but 
it had to be my decision. Finally, I went to Health 
Services on campus and talked to a nurse who gave 
me excellent advice and was all in favor of the pill. 
That convinced me and now I'm happy with my 
decision." The only side affect she had from the pill 
was acne for the first three months while her body 
was adjusting to the hormones.
Many women are extremely happy with using 
birth control pills although a few do experience 
side effects during the first few months. A senior at 
the University of Delaware began using the pill 
two months ago and she is currently experiencing 
terrible acne. "My doctor changed the prescription 
but I'm still getting acne. If my skin doesn't im­
prove soon I'm planning to go off of the pill," she 
says.
Although birth control pills are the easiest 
method of birth control to use, are the most effec­
tive, and do not interrupt love-making, there are 
other options to choose from. The chart shows 
various different contraceptive methods and their 
respective failure rates.
If you have any questions about any type of 
birth control, Health Services has many pamphlets 
or a nurse would be happy to give you answers. 
The number of CMU Health Services is ext 2157.

Counselors lend a sympathetic ear
An unplanned pregnancy is not the kind of 
thing that can be~made to go away simply talking 
to a friend or boyfriend. No matter what the situ­
ation is, eventually the woman will have to turn to 
someone, at least for medical care, if not emotional 
support or advice. So where can she turn? Who can 
she talk to?
Senior Lara Kovadc, a resident assistant here at 
CMU, says if a student came to her, she feels the 
most important thing she could do would be to lis­
ten. 'There are probably a lot of things she needs 
or wants to say," Kovacic says. Another thing she 
would do is make sure that the woman knew what 
kind of help was available to her. She would help 
the woman get in touch with people who could 
help her find answers, such as the Counseling 
Center or Planned Parenthood. One thing that 
frightens Kovacic is that many women don't know 
what their choices are, and she feels it is important 
for them to know all of their options so that they 
can make the best decision for themselves.
Sophomore Dan Fiore, another RA, says that 
the first thing he would do would be to find out 
whether or not she has talked to her parents. If she 
hadn't, he would tell her "not to underestimate her 
parents." While they might not be thrilled, he feels 
they might be able to offer her support. Fiore feels 
that the role of an RA is to listen and help her get 
in touch with people who are better prepared to 
assist.
The CMU Counseling Center is another place a 
student might consider going. According to Glen 
Sherman, a counselor at the Center, the first thing 
they would do, after getting all the details of what 
she has done so far, is offer education about how to 
take care of herself. If she hadn't had any medical 
care, they would have her work with the Health 
Center.
The second thing they would do is to talk to 
her about how she was feeling about the preg­
nancy. A counselor would talk to her about her re­
lationship with the father. Does she feel she can tell 
him? How does he feel? The main thing a coun­
selor would do is have her explore the situation 
and her feelings so that she can come to terms with 
the what is going on and what she is going to do 
about it.
Here in Pittsburgh, Planned Parenthood, and 
Magee Women's Hospital are two places that a 
student might think of going if she were pregnant. 
These centers offer medical assistance; however, 
the only counseling they offer from is a doctor, 
telling what her options are and the risks involved 
with each choice. Neither place employs counsel­
ors, but both places are able to recommend some­
where where a pregnant woman might get addi­
tional counseling if she feels she needs or wants it.
If the woman is religious, a place she might 
turn is her place of worship Father Bryan Sum­
mers of the University Oratory of the Holy Spirit 
Parish would "first try to find out what the girl's 
relationship with the [biological] father of the child 
was and if he knew, find out how he felt." It would 
be important to know what kind of relationship 
she had with her family to see whether or not they
would support her. Her feeling and decisions she 
had come to would affect the advice Summers 
gives. He would advise her of the possibility of 
adoption and if she should decide to keep the 
baby, he would make sure she understood the re­
sponsibilities involved. He would offer her the 
church's support psychologically and financially. If 
she needed a place to live, she could live with a 
Catholic family or in one of the homes for unwed 
mothers.
If she were considering an abortion, Summers 
says he would make sure she understood the 
Church's position on abortion. "It is one of the 
most serious infringements on the teachings of the 
church," he says. If the woman did terminate her 
pregnancy, he would try to make sure she gets the 
psychological help she needs to overcome some 
feelings she may be having. "I'd try to help her 
understand that while abortion is a serious sin, it is 
confessable and needs absolution,' he says. "If a 
person is truly contrite, they can be absolved."
Summers stresses that he would only say this 
to someone who has had an abortion and is look­
ing to reconcile herself with the church, under­
standing the seriousness of what she has done. "It's 
not an escape clause," he says.
Rabbi Joseph Levine of B'nai B'rith Hillel feels 
that every case is highly individualized and the 
matter is extremely delicate to the woman in­
volved. He believes that a decision should not be 
reached until she has thought through all the 
options possible to reach "self-understanding and a 
mature consideration." And whatever decision 
results should be one that she "can live with."
However, he emphasizes that his opinion does 
not reflect Judaic principles, and if the woman is 
seeking religious reconciliation, he would advise 
her to look at adoption as an option. Moreover, 
Levine expresses that he is not the spokesman for 
Judaism. He emphasizes that he is a "liberal rabbi", 
and an Orthodox rabbi would serve better to 
explain the traditionalist view on unplanned 
pregnancy.
One person a woman might want to ask for 
advice is someone who has been through the 
experience. One woman who found out she was 
pregnant when she was seventeen and in her last 
year of high school says, "I think it is a decision 
each person makes for themselves," she says. I 
chose to keep my baby." If a young woman were to 
ask her advice, she would recommend having the 
baby. The decision of whether or not to keep the 
baby would depend on how the girl felt about the 
situation and her ability to care for a child. Can she 
provide for the baby? Is the father offering to help 
her out? She would definitely tell the girl to get 
counseling. She feels it would help the girl decide 
what she wants to do. One last thing she would tell 
the young woman is "not to get married just be­
cause [she's] pregnant. That would be one of the 
worst things [she] could do."

Young motherhood has its risks
Adolescence is an important period in a 
person's life; these are the formative years, a time 
when you make decisions about who you are and 
what your aspirations are. The last statistics devel­
oped by the Allegheny County Health Department 
(ACHD) indicate that in 1986,12.3 percent of all of 
the live births in the nation were to mothers 15-19 
years old.
According to an article in a December 1985 
issue of Time magazine, fewer than five percent of 
teenagers who decided to have their children gave 
them up for adoption. Even now, relinquishment 
is still a relatively rare event.
What are the social, psychological, and medical 
implications, for both the mother and child, of 
early-age parenthood?
Adolescent motherhood has been linked to 
lower levels of high school and college completion 
by several studies, including recent studies done 
by the Family Health Council and a study written 
by doctors Howard and Joy Osofsky in 1983. 
According to the FHC, less than two percent of the 
women who became mothers at the age of 20 
complete college, and only half even receive a high 
school diploma.
Despite programs established by public 
schools around the country to keep young mothers 
in school, these women often acquire less educa­
tion than their peers. As a result, they are forced to 
depend on welfare. Of the women who receive 
Aid for Dependent Children, another public means 
of financial support for young families, 71 percent 
had their first child as a teenager. Financial 
support of families headed by young mothers is 
sometimes characterized as an inherent sign of 
consent; if we support it, then we condone teenage 
pregnancy.
Mary Litman, director of the downtown 
Women's Health Center, feels strongly about the 
difficulties young mothers have in supporting their 
families and the mixed signals they are given by 
society. "If we (as a society] are going to deny 
young women birth control and access to abor­
tion," she said, "then we have a responsibility to 
take care of them and their children."
The medical complications of an early-age 
pregnancy are astounding. "As the ages get 
lower," says Litman, "the risk to mother and infant 
becomes higher."
According to the FHC, low birthweight is the 
leading cause of infant mortality; studies done by 
the ACHD indicate a correlation between low 
birthweight and high rates of mental retardation 
and other neurological defects. Concerns for the 
health of the mother are related to the ability of a 
young woman's body to endure the rigors of preg­
nancy, especially at an age when most young 
women don't have a nutritionally sound diet, and

deny young women birth con­
trol and access to abortion, 
then we have a responsibility

children."

have weaker immune systems.
Another important aspect of early-age preg­
nancy is the support young mothers need from 
their families and other institutions such as their 
communities and schools. Osofsky and Osofsky of 
FHC found that adolescent parents have special
needs. Three of the most important factors are 
crucial support from the teen age mother's mother, 
a variety of social support systems and a knowl­
edge of positive as well as negative consequences 
of pregnancy. Often these needs are not fulfilled; 
disruption of support systems as a result can mean 
less support than the mother experienced.
The social and medical aspects of adolescent 
pregnancy are a lot to have to face, regardless of 
whether the mother is 15 or 20 years old. Although 
these obstacles seem insurmountable in many 
ways, many young mothers are doing a little better 
every day, completing high school and in some 
cases, even college.
On the issue of support for young mothers, 
Litman suggests that support "has to come from 
the churches, neighborhoods, families and 
schools."

Now, though, John is more attached to his son 
than before. With Laura, there still is resentment on 
both sides. Close friends witness a "love and hate" 
relationship. Some say that John and Laura should 
try to work things out.
Laura now has moved from home to go to a 
college near CMU. She brought her son with her. 
John and Laura are at the point where they talk 
more often than before. She's had one boyfriend 
since she and John broke up. Recently, she ex­
pressed an interest in getting back together. He 
turned her down, as he still harbors some resent­
ment. For John, he's gone on dates, but hasn't 
actively looked for a relationship.
Perhaps he hasn't wanted to think about it, he 
says. "Every time I see a woman who's pregnant, I 
get this chill, it just reminds me of the whole thing 
and now I have associated it with a very unpleas­
ant situation.... I know the pregnancy will have an 
effect on me later on how I feel about having chil­
dren — even maybe about getting married."
Now, John thinks he's at the point of handling 
it just by talking. Freshman year, he went to 
counseling. One day, a Friday at 4:30, he decided it 
was time to go. Mostly, it just allowed him to listen 
to himself, he notes.
"Throughout the whole thing, I've learned to 
deal with my own emotions and problems just by 
talking with people I feel comfortable with," he 
says. "I think that works the best."
" 'Guess what. I'm 
pregnant.' That's exactly 
what she said. I remember 
the words," John says.
John still has some problems. He would like to 
have a better relationship with his son, now one 
and a half years old. But since the son lives with 
Laura, John doesn't like to visit often, as he still is 
uncomfortable with Laura. He's wanted to be with 
his son alone for a day, but says he wouldn't be 
sure what to do. Also, he doesn't think it is his 
place to just take him, since he hasn't been there 
most of the time.
"In my situation, there's no 'right choice,' " 
John says. Instead, he thinks there is a series of 
choices — one follows the next in a natural pro­
gression — and not one single, isolated decision.
John says he would like to change the way he 
felt and still feels about children and his son in 
general. He seems to still have a stigma, much like 
the one he feels towards pregnant women.
Other than the birth control he didn't use that 
day, John says he is at peace with himself. His
mother pressures him to spend time with his son, 
and his grandparents are still looking for a mar­
riage, but John says he's pretty much reckoned 
with everything from his past.
At Carnegie Mellon, John basically keeps busy, 
"really busy," as he puts it. While he realizes he 
may be guilty of "hiding" in his work, he doesn't 
think it's a strong possibility that he'll have to go to 
more counseling.
John says people in his position should "keep a 
handle on yourself and who you want to be. Look 
at it from your own perspective." Don't just 
blindly follow others, but do think about what they 
say. Ultimately, he says, "You've got to be able to 
live with yourself, got to be able to look at yourself 
in the mirror when you wake up in the morning.... 
You have to satisfy what your own set of values 
asks of you before you can satisfy anything else 
anyone asks of you."
John knows a lot of this may sound callous, but 
he's been through a lot. It was a rough time. Like 
he says, it was "a crisis."
"I think it is really important to talk to some­
one — be it a counselor or a friend," he says. "Just 
someone."

article have been changed to protect their confidentiality.

The other half: A CMU father tells his story
John is your basic CMU student; roughing it 
through classes, going to a party when no work 
keeps him home, and just living the life of a normal 
college student. Or trying to.
During his senior year at his high school, John 
got his girlfriend pregnant. They had been going 
out for a year and a half and had been having sex 
for ten months during that time. After Christmas 
break, John's girlfriend Laura had not yet had her 
period. She was late — again. She gave him a call 
after she had seen the doctor.
" 'Guess what. I'm pregnant.' That's exactly 
what she said. I remember the words," John says. 
"My heart dropped out. I was just scared."
During those ten months, John and Laura were 
practicing birth control on and off. They used con­
doms, at times. "Not this time," John laughs a bit 
nervously. "It was supposed to be one of those safe 
periods." He was referring to the rhythm method, 
the only birth control method supported by the 
Catholic Church, and therefore, the only one 
taught in John's sex-ed class.
Laura wasn't on the pill — she was afraid her 
parents would find out. So they alternated be­
tween condoms and the rhythm method.
As for thinking about pregnancy before partici­
pating in intercourse, John says he suffered from 
the "it can't happen to me" problem. So it went 
back and forth month to month. Laura was often 
late with her period, so they had talked about preg­
nancy and the possible alternatives. They ended up 
supporting adoption.
John was originally for abortion. But Laura 
was an adopted child. She felt as though she 
should carry such a burden, much as her "real" 
mother did. They began planning for adoption.
After the phone call, John couldn't tell his 
parents. Laura's parents came over that night and 
did it instead.
John's parents were upset. Instead of the 
reaction he expected, his parents insisted he try to 
keep his distance emotionally, not get married, and 
not change his mind about going to CMU.
John says he had briefly thought of marriage, 
but realized he wasn't ready for it. Also, he noted 
that "if the relationship was going to survive, it 
would survive without the marriage."
Laura's parents blamed Laura, not John. John 
attributes this to the fact that Laura did not get 
along with her parents much.
John went to a private, Catholic school. When 
his friends found out about the pregnancy, John 
says, they were mostly surprised or shocked, 
because he was that person in high school that you 
"never thought it would happen to."
John's friends, after their initial surprised reac­
tion, were all supportive. School was not much 
different. Teachers were supportive, and the 
school as a whole supported his choice of adoption.
Since Laura went to a local public school, most 
of her friends didn't know John well. Closer 
friends of hers, however, were supportive towards 
him.
Four months into the pregnancy, Laura de­
cided she wanted to keep the baby, stay home, and 
go to a local college. She said it was John's choice
L3 \kär-neg'-e\
to do as he wanted. He says he decided he wasn't 
going to be bound to anything, but would give 
whatever support he could. "I don't feel commit­
ted because this is a decision you're making," John 
told her. "You can't make it for both of us."
John and Laura went to counseling together 
during the nine-month term. John says that "noth­
ing a whole hell of a lot happens." The counselors 
mostly concentrated on Laura, helping her with her 
choices. Not that the counseling consciously ig­
nored him, he says, but it didn't give much atten­
tion to helping him to deal with his emotions as it 
did for her.
During those nine months, other problems 
became insignificant. "It basically went to a panic 
situation," John says. "All the problems, all the 
things we were dealing with before got shoved to 
the back burner.... It was a crisis."
"At first, it was just dealing with feelings. 
Dealing with parents' anger and stuff like that." 
Then, gradually, Laura started making more 
demands on John. One example was a request that 
John be in the delivery room. John's parents didn't 
want him to go, and John didn't particularly care to 
go, either.
In the end, John decided to, however, as he 
promised to give Laura support. Isolated, it seems 
trivial, but problems of the type began to happen 
with more frequency.
Things came to a point where it was commonly
Laura against John's parents. 'These were the two 
main forces in my life at that point," he says. His 
parents were already angry, and John didn't want 
to irritate them any more. Yet, he felt he had an 
obligation to help Laura through.
During this time, as well, Laura became de­
pressed often and they fought on the phone a lot, 
contributing to more problems and tension. Also, 
walking in public became a problem — people 
stared. John and Laura tried to ignore the stares, 
telling themselves that they weren't for them.
Then the day came. John went to the delivery 
room with Laura, even though she said she really 
didn't care if he did. Later, Laura admitted that she 
was glad he was there with her. Adding to his fear 
was the fact that the baby would be delivered by 
Caesarean section.
"I basically held her hand and closed my eyes 
and listened," says John. Eventually, I heard the 
baby crying. I was scared. I refused to look. I hid 
behind a little shield."
When John first saw his son, he was scared. 
The second time, he tried not to feel. "I was going 
away in less than a month. 20 or 22 days ... 23, 
actually. It was important to me not to become 
emotionally attached in the coming three weeks 
because I knew ... I wouldn't be a part of their 
regular lives." Coupled with the stress of going 
away to school, he wouldn't be able to deal with 
the situation or pressure.

---------------------------------------------------

Motherhood —a personal view
Pregnancy was no 
better emotionally than physi­
cally. I always worried about 
carrying my baby. I was scared 
of my new life and the decision 
I had made.
In the first week of my senior year at CMU, 
Health Services informed me that I was six to eight 
weeks pregnant. Now the father of the child and I 
are happily parenting an unexpected but wanted 
child.
The decision to keep the pregnancy was a hard 
one to make. It concerned three lives directly. The 
father of the child and I agreed that abortion was a 
better idea than three unhappy lives. Before I was 
faced with pregnancy, I had great academic and 
athletic goals for myself. I was supposed to gradu­
ate in May and then go to graduate school. As one 
of CMU's top athletes, I had hoped to go to NCAA 
nationals that year.
Being pregnant was going to make my aca­
demic goals very difficult and my athletic goals 
impossible. I was afraid that dropping my lifelong 
dreams for the sake of the child would make me 
hate him or her. The father was nervous about the 
thought of becoming a father, but was not in favor 
of aborting a pregnancy just because it was unex­
pected. We agreed that in deciding to continue the 
pregnancy, we both would have to continue 
pursuing our goals to be happy. With our friends 
and families' support, we decided to brave the 
lives of parenthood.
At seventeen weeks gestation, still nervous but 
content with our decision, we found out that the 
fetus had a rare but serious birth defect. The 
possible outcomes of this defect were various: It 
could be completely correctable through surgery, 
or it could result in blindness, severe brain dam­
age, respiratory damage, and abdominal pain for 
life. The list of possible side effects goes on. My 
partner was sure that bringing a child with serious 
birth defects into the world would be miserable for 
the child and for him. While I was terrified of 
bringing an unhappy child into the world and 
destroying our happiness in the process, my fear of 
aborting when the child could be happy overpow­
ered all our other doubts.
I want to emphasize that while I am writing 
these words to try to explain how my decisions 
effected me, no one can ever really understand 
what I went through and no one could have even 
made the decision for me. Ideas of "no more 
abortion" and "adopting is the answer" do not 
consider the life of the mother or the life of an 
"imperfect baby."
The nine months of pregnancy was the worst 
period of my life, when it should have been the 
"best so far." I had seen men athletes compete 
through having children, but as the mother I 
couldn't. For one month I spent more time with 
doctors and insurance agencies than I did with my 
class work. Before my baby came home from the 
hospital, we had accumulated more than $50,000 in
medical bills.
Physically, pregnancy was demoralizing: 
morning sickness, feeling fat, getting fat, having 
the fetus move into the space of all my internal 
organs, indigestion, carrying thirty pounds for 
three months — again, my list of complaints goes 
on. I could not be the athlete I wanted to be. I lost 
control of doing what I wanted to do with body. I 
had to take meticulous care of myself. I watched 
every movement I made, every breath I took, every 
bite I ate, and still my family and partner wanted 
me to be more cautious.
Pregnancy was no better emotionally than 
physically. I always worried about carrying my 
baby. I was scared of my new life and the decision I 
had made. The idea of adoption for every unex­
pected pregnancy is idealistic at best. Adoption is a 
choice for only those braver than I. Amazingly, I 
had begun to love the creature invading my body. 
After the discovery of the defect my major reason 
for considering abortion was for the unborn itself, 
because a severely defected child would not be one 
quickly grabbed up for adoption. Giving this child 
up for adoption would have been abandonment.
My pregnancy showed me that Pro-Lifers are 
not at all understanding of the lives of the people . 
faced with "the choice." They have never been 
forced to make the decision while they were poor, 
afraid of being shunned instead of helped by their 
families, expecting a child with a painful birth 
defect, or giving up their dreams.
Though I hated making the decision and hated 
being pregnant, I love my family and motherhood. 
My child, the father, and I are only happy now 
because the choice was mine.

Abortion — a personal view
When I first found out I was pregnant I just 
stood there staring at the little pink test stick. The 
entire inside of my body felt like it had been emp­
tied out. I couldn't think and I couldn't move. I 
just stood there frozen, staring.
Any criticism you can make of me can't be 
worse than the ones I've made of myself. I hadn't 
been careful about birth control. No one, not even 
my boyfriend Mike, can understand why I let 
myself have sex without a condom. It wasn't like I 
didn't know how unsafe withdrawal was. Anyone 
in his or her right mind would say, well, she got 
what she deserved.
I'm not about to defend myself. I've already 
gone through, and am still going through, strong 
feelings about what I did and why I did it. Staring 
at what seems to be your life going down the tubes 
is a hell of way to learn a lesson. I'm asking you to 
listen to my story because this happens to a lot of 
people using legitimate methods of birth control.
It wasn't until after I had the abortion that I 
actually thought about the choice I had made. I 
mean, there was no other choice for me as far as I 
saw it.
This all happened over Christmas break. I was 
already registered for this semester, committed to 
various positions and responsibilities on campus. I 
wasn't about to drop out of CMU. I don't know if 
I'll eventually marry Mike or not, but I certainly 
wasn't going to do so now. We've only been dating 
for about a year and I'm not planning on getting 
married until I'm ready.
As for having the baby on my own, I can 
barely manage the responsibility of all my classes 
and activities here. I certainly wasn't ready to give 
up my freedom during what everybody says are 
supposed to be the best years of your life. It just 
came down to the fact that for me having a child 
right now would mean sacrificing my life. As for 
adoption, I had decided a long time ago that any 
child I would go through the pain of childbirth for, 
I wouldn't give up.
I never asked Mike what he wanted. I think I 
know him well enough to know that he wanted me 
to have the abortion. It's funny, because no matter 
what he said, I would have made the same deci­
sion. It just would've been a hell of a lot harder to 
go through with it if I didn't know he supported 
me. If he had said, "I want this child, it's half 
mine," I couldn't have exactly said, "Fine, you carry 
it around for nine months." You see, it might have 
been half his child but the decision was mine 
because it was inside me.
I called Planned Parenthood because it was the 
first name I knew and trusted. They said they 
didn't perform abortions but they refered me to a 
women's center that did. I called on Monday 
morning and scheduled an appointment for that 
Thursday. They told me it was 275 dollars in cash 
and that I shouldn't eat anything that morning
because of the anesthesia they were going to give 
me. I would find out everything else when I got 
there. I felt like I was in some bad TV cop show 
and when I got there they were going to say, "You 
got the money? Good, we got the stuff."
Mike doesn't live near me, so I couldn't see 
him when all this was happening. I talked to him 
on the phone every night that week. I got up 
Thursday morning and my brother drove me to the 
clinic. I filled out pages of forms. I sat there reading 
all the medical ins and outs of the procedure and 
signing my name to waivers. I went in and paid the 
secretary cash. They took a urine sample, a blood 
sample, and gave me a shot in my side. I felt like I 
was about to faint, partly because I have an ex­
treme fear of needles and had just been poked by 
two of them, and partly because I hadn't eaten 
anything. I got up and went into a small waiting 
room with two other women.
A female doctor came in and described the 
procedure. I'll spare you; you don't want to hear it. 
The two women and I went in to seperate changing 
rooms, put our clothes in a bag, and got into the 
hospital gowns. It was right at this moment that I 
felt completely alone. I'll never forget that feeling 
as long as I live.
I was given general anesthesia so I was out 
through the whole procedure. I woke up in a bed 
in the recovery room with extreme cramps and diz­
ziness. I got dressed. The nurses fed me a cookie 
and I got out of there as fast as I could. At that 
point, I just wanted to be home, feel better, and 
forget about it as soon as possible.
I'm still waiting to forget about it.
I felt very alone despite all the phone calls and 
support. Don't get me wrong, Mike did everything 
he could have. But when I was sitting there having 
a needle stuck in me on this metal lab table and I 
was shaking because I was cold and terrified, there 
wasn't a whole hell of a lot he could do for me.
I suppose I'm still bitter because of everything 
that happened. He was just as irresponsible as me, 
but I had to go through the pain. It just doesn't 
seem fair. Ahh, but life's not fair, right? I never did 
listen. I mean, I heard everyone say it, but I never 
listened. The woman is responsible for birth 
control because she's the one that gets pregnant.
Say that to any guy who says he's a liberal. Watch 
him cringe and say it's a mutual responsibility. But 
the fact is, I went through the pain, fear, guilt, and 
humiliation.
My perceptions of everything around me are 
somehow different. I suppose the strongest feeling 
that lingers is this gnawing wonder of what my life 
would be like if I had had the child. This whole 
experience has changed me in ways I can't even 
begin to explain.
The names of the people in the preceding article

Legalized abortion: The battle continues
After the Roe v Wade decision was chipped 
away by the Supreme Court last July, abortionhas 
once again become subject to scrutiny in state and 
federal courts. As the law states it today, abortion 
is still legal within the first trimester. But there are 
strong opinions arguing for both sides of the pro- 
choice/pro-life issue.
Every year, about 30 percent of all women who 
become pregnant decide to have an abortion. Out 
of this 1.6 million women, 90 percent have the op­
eration within the first ten weeks of their preg­
nancy.
Younger women have a large percent of all 
abortions. Women aged 18-24 comprised 49 
percent of all the abortions performed in 
Pittsburgh's Women's Health Services last year.
The issue is relevant to students because most 
women who choose to have abortion are unmar­
ried; 31 percent attend college or high school. Most 
students do not have enough financial and social 
stability to take care of a child.
Indeed, abortion is undoubtedly the most 
common choice made by pregnant CMU students. 
Director of Student Health Services Anita Barkin 
reports that while no statistics are compiled by the
Health Center, by far the majority of the pregnant 
students she's had experience with have had 
abortions.
One pro-life argument against abortion is that 
it is used as a form of retroactive birth control. 
Abortion supporters, however, claim abortion is 
not used in such a manner. A woman who uses ab­
solutely no birth control methods, and assumes 
that she will simply get abortions, can end up preg­
nant two to three times a year, according to a study 
compiled by National Abortion Federation.
Women simply don't have abortions three times a 
year. In fact, a vast majority of those having an 
abortion have only one per lifetime.
However, if abortion is available as an option it 
can tend to lead to less responsible sexual behavior, 
say pro-life groups, for it is always present as an 
escape if a woman gets pregnant. This is not to say 
that it is necessarily thought of consciously as birth 
control, but rather that it contributes to the thought 
process that leads to irresponsible behavior, they 
say.
The issue at the heart of the controversy is the 
definition of when life begins. Pro-life groups 
argue that life starts at conception, while pro­
choice groups argue that no one can determine the 
viability of the fetus. If the fetus is alive, then the 
child's right to life conflicts with the mother's right 
to pursue happiness. Since there is no conclusive 
evidence that the fetus is not living, pro-lifers 
argue, it is better to make a law that will save a 
potential life than lose one.
However, a large number of people do not feel 
that the fetus is alive. They argue that the govern­
ment would be sacrificing the rights of women by 
forcing them to continue pregnancies. They also 
argue that women will have abortions whether 
they are legal or not, so it would be better to have 
them done in a legal, medical settings than in 
potentially hazardous back alleys.
Related to the abortion issue is controversy 
regarding what to do in special cases — rape, 
incest, or danger to the mother's life. Many pro­
lifers have varying opinions for these cases.
There are many different arguments involved 
and this is a debate that will continue for the 
foreseeable future. Both sides are armed with 
rhetoric, propaganda, and occasional facts, so the 
battle continues.
by JULIE LIU 
Tartan Assistant Magazine Editor
Abortion and the everchanging law
On the one hand, there is the protection of 
human life. On the other, there is the woman's 
right to make a decision about when and if to have 
children. Beyond personal views, the fact remains 
that there are laws dealing with the issue, and 
they're changing quickly.
Abortion is one of the hottest topics in politics 
today, and currently the Supreme Court has 
brought it into the spotlight by challenging the 
longstanding Roe v. Wade decision that "solved" for 
17 years the pro-life/pro-choice debate.
Roe v. Wade recognized that states may "prop­
erly assert important interests in safeguarding 
health, in maintaining medical standards, and in 
protecting potential life." However, since then, the 
Supreme Court has consistently struck down state 
laws regulating abortion — to the point at which 
Roe is considered the case that legalized abortion.
This precedent has remained uncompromised, 
until recently that is. On July 3, a decision was
made on the Webster v. Reproductive Health Services 
case. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, upheld 
regulations passed by the Missouri state legislature 
that severely challenged Roe v. Wade, if not in letter, 
then in practice.
Roe proclaims that women have a fundamental 
right to abortion. Technically it makes abortion 
legal in the first three months of pregnancy. The 
Missouri law maintains that life begins at concep­
tion. It bans public funds, facilities, or employees 
from being used to counsel in favor of abortion or 
to perform medically unnecessary abortions; 
requires tests for fetal viability after 20 weeks; and 
requires that abortions after 16 weeks of gestation 
be performed in a hospital.
In Pennsylvania, the leeway that women once 
had has come to an end. The Webster decision has 
spurred the introduction and ultimate passage of 
the Abortion Control Act of 1989 in the Pennsylva­
nia House of Representatives.
The act in its final form consists of: a ban on 
sex-selection abortions; a ban on the use of aborted 
fetuses for medical research; and a ban on abor­
tions performed after 24 weeks except to prevent 
the death of the woman or to avert substantial and 
irreversible impairment of major bodily functions 
(a doctor breaking this law would face a penalty of 
up to 20 years in prison and a $25,000 fine).
Two other provisions of the law have been 
injoined by a U.S. district court and thus have not 
taken effect: an "informed consent" provision that 
requires a woman be informed about the abortion 
procedure, potential risks, and alternatives, and 
then wait 24 hours before obtaining an abortion; 
and a general requirement that a husband be 
notified before his spouse's abortion.

The search continues for adopting couples
Adoption has been dramatized on television 
and in print media. With all of the hype and the re­
strictions in the laws that vary in each state, adop­
tion seems to be a difficult and tangled process. 
Existing systems are not facilitating the links 
between birth mothers and prospective families. 
More importantly, they also neglect the special 
problems of older, handicapped, and minority chil­
dren.
Critics point a finger at the state-run agencies 
for these failures. They accuse them of leaving 
countless children with biological parents who are 
unfit or unable to care for their offspring. These 
children are later take from parents and put in 
foster care. By the time this happens, these children 
are often too old to be easily "adoptable" and con­
sequently suffer mental repercussions. Meanwhile, 
families, desperate to adopt, often turn to interna­
tional adoption.
Criticism aside, both private and governmen- 
tally run agencies do a great deal of work in match­
ing children to adoptive parents. Private or inde­
pendent adoptions (parent to parent without an 
official licensed intermediary), which are consid­
ered a "gray market," make up for the frustrating 
inadequacies of the agencies. The biological 
parents often take advantage of searching families, 
charging exorbitant amounts of money and not 
telling adopting parents if a child is handicapped

college campuses.
in some way.
In any case, it can take years to find a white 
infant for a family that has met the governmental 
qualificatios, such as a married, childless, infertile 
couple. If a family is willing to take in an older 
child, a minority child, or one with special needs 
(such as a physical or mental handicap) then the 
search will be much shorter.
Searching parents who for some reason are 
either turned down by agencies or feel that their 
waiting lists are too long scour high schools, 
popular teen hangouts, and college campuses. 
They circulate information among their friends in 
an attempt to make their search known to as many 
people as possible.
Such is the case with Bonnie and Bob, a couple
When a mom relinquishes her baby
In the recent past a woman who had a child 
out of wedlock had given birth to an "illegitimate" 
child. Attitudes have changed, and this is no 
longer the case. A wide range of options is now 
open to such women, and one alternative is 
adoption. Adoption is seen as a middle road for 
those who are not willing to have an abortion, for 
whatever reasons, but are also unable to raise the 
child themselves. Even though adoption relieves 
the womam from the burden of parenting, but car­
rying a child to term, and then giving it up, re­
mains an ordeal.
In recent years, there has been a shift in ideas 
as to what is best for the child, and this has meant a 
growing involvement of the birth mother in her 
child's welfare. A majority of mothers now choose 
the adoptive parents for their child. When these 
mothers express preferences, agencies will often 
bend over backwards to accommodate them.
In addition, many birth mothers wish to 
remain in contact with their children after the 
adoption has taken place. This contact may come in 
the form of visits, letters, or playing a role similar 
to an aunt or godparent. And many adopting 
families are willing to agree, especially in light of 
evidence that adopted children are better off in the 
long run because of this contact.
Naturally, not every birth mother chooses this
option. While she may know that giving up her 
baby for adoption will provide a better life for the 
child, the conflicting emotions that accompany an 
adoption are often too intense to bear such a re­
minder. As Lucy Spruill of Roselia Center puts it,
"it is a loss experience," and the mother must be 
ready to go through the grieving that goes along 
with it. Therefore, many women choose the 
traditional route of anonymity, as they feel this is 
the best way for all parties to get on with their 
lives. Furthermore, a 1986 Pennsylvania bill denies 
an adopted person access to his birth certificate. A 
birth certificate has the mother's name, age, 
birthplace, and sometimes even a father's name.
Perhaps the biggest problem for a biological 
mother is the lack of sufficient counseling from the 
point when she learns she is pregnant and must 
review her options. Traditional attitudes toward 
unwed motherhood are reflected in our institutions 
which favor and sympathize more with the adopt­
ing parents than the biological one. Birth mothers 
have been traditionally told by society that they are 
abandoning their children. In fact, the society 
which necessitated adoption is the same one which 
neglects the woman giving up her child.

who have been advertising in the Pitt News and 
The Tartan since last spring. They have had a few 
responses, but so far not much luck. In addition to 
the newspapers, they have postered in area grocery 
stores and they give cards to their friends. The 
couple was told that they were ineligible for adop­
tion by the agencies they consulted, and the • •<* 
year waiting list just to begin a search was daunt­
ing as well.
Once Bonnie and Bob find a child however, the 
legal channels to adopt the child are the same as if 
the search had been through fh agency. The 
biological mother must attenu a court hearing to 
have her rights removed. And the law in Pennsyl­
vania says that the birth father must be involved in 
the process as well. He can choose to remove 
himself, but he must make this decision formally.
In some cases those who wish to adopt never 
find a suitable child. Current institutions certainly 
have limitations, and this only adds to the diffi­
culty. However, adoption is a delicate matter, and 
while improvement may be needed in the current 
procedure, some of these limitations are inherent in 
the process. No matter what path perspective 
parents choose, it is a difficult and expensive 
process.

The Women’s Center: A place to turn
at the Women's Center won't perceive it as bearing 
the stigma that sometimes accompanies formal 
counseling.
To supplement the open environment of the 
center, organizers have established a library of 
materials on women's issues. The center is open 
daily until 8 pm, and in addition to serving as a 
place where women can go to talk, it will act as a 
home to groups concerned with women's issues.
The center's organizers also plan self-defense 
workshops, seminars, and discussions to try to 
help the Carnegie Mellon campus better under­
stand the plight of women here.
But the center is not a place that's exclusively 
for women. "Everybody's welcome to come and 
learn," says Rennella. 'It's not a women's secret 
club."
Men who can't find a date and women who 
don't necessarily want one sometimes find CMU's 
ratio of seven men to three women humorous.
But it's not always funny. Carnegie Mellon 
women deal with pressures and feelings to which 
their male counterparts are immune.
"Sometimes," says Vivianna Rennella, one of 
the organizers of the Carnegie Mellon Women's 
Center, "it can be very lonely and scary." Rennella 
says that sexism is not foreign to Carnegie Mellon, 
and women deal with it in various ways each day.
"We want to make sure that women are aware 
of and are able to take advantage of those opportu­
nities to which they are entitled," says Heather 
Hood, a fourth-year architecture student and one 
of the organizers of the center.
The classroom situation can be both tense and 
trying for women. Hood points out that women are 
less likely to talk in class than men. 'There is some­
times a difference between the way people are 
treated academically and socially," she says.
"A professor or classmate will say something
— something that is sexist," explains Daniele 
Wilmouth, another of the center's organizers, "and 
you know that it's not quite right but you don't 
know why."
Wilmouth, along with the rest of the center's 
organizers, hope that the center will help women to 
help each other work through these kinds of 
situations.
The organizers of the center, located in 
Morrison's Lounge in Margaret Morrison Plaza, 
say that they hope to create an environment that 
helps women to deal with their problems. "Coun­
seling and Student Affairs are open to everyone," 
explains Rennella. "Women aren't necessarily 
comfortable to talk about their issues there."
For some women, seeking advice about 
gender-related issues — like pregnancy — might 
be easier at a place like the Women's Center than in 
a clinical environment.
Hood points out that people who talk to others
