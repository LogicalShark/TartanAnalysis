The W. U. P. GameJAMES B. COOPER.Kiski vs. Tech
On the morning of October 22d the 
entire student body was shocked toOn an exceedingly slippery field, learn of the death of their friend and 
with a driving rain most of the time, classmate, James B. Cooper. Having 
Tech measured strength with W. U. been ill for but a few days, it was
P. and surprised themselves and ev- ¡¡ard for fellows to realize that1 . he was dead. One of the most pop-eryone else by the fine showing they ujar men in the school, with a quiet, 
made, even though greatly out- retiring manner, he had won the re­
weighed. If our men had had equal- spect of all the men. Immediately
lv as good training facilities as W. after s<rh°o1 °Pe+ne1d onKM^n^y 1morn‘mg action was taken by both classes U. P. there is no room left' for doubt and an expression of sympathy and
but what we would have scored regret, was tendered to the bereaved 
against them more than once. Tech parents, 
played W. U. P. to a standstill in the 
first half; but in the second half, es­
pecially the last 7 or 8 minutes of 
play, our fellows began to weaken, 
owing to their lack of training. Had 
our line held, Henderson’s kick 
would not have been blocked, and 
the score for the first half would 
have been 0 to 0. All through the 
game W. U. P. used very dirty tac­
tics, slugging and giving our men 
the knee upon every possible occa­
sion.
When it comes to saying just what
were the features of the game, it is a
difficult matter, for all the men from 
Tech did excellent work. On several 
occasions our men broke through 
W. U. P.’s line and downed the run­
ner for a loss. All of the backs made 
good gains through the line, and sev­
eral good end runs were made. The
ends played star games in getting up friend, James B. Cooper, 
the field after punts. All in all, Tech We, the members of the Class of 
did rather better on the offensive 1908 of the Carnegie Technical 
than they did on the defensive; and Schools, while bowing to this decree,

anything else. Tech’s coaching the relatives in their sorrow; also, 
last couple of weeks, especially the That the loss is more keenly felt 
last week, showed itself in this game, because of our personal knowledge of

than in any of their previous games, position and his upright and noble 
It is the conservative opinion of character; also,

California’s 30-yard line. 1909.

On Saturday, Octobr 20th, Tech 
met Kiski for the second time this 
season, at Friendship park, in a hard- 
fought game. Tech went' on the field 
all confident of victory, but the in­
evitable result of their confidence 
came to Tech, and they lest, 5-0.
The game started with Kiski kick­
ing to Tech. The ball was received 
by Dowling on the 5-yard line, who 
ran 15 yards and was down°d only 
to fumble the ball after his brilliant 
run. Henderson fell on the ball, and 
Tech started up the field. In the 
middle of the field Tech lost cn a 
fumble. Kiski tried again by a line 
play, but to no avail, and was forced 
to kick. Wright ran the ball back 15 
yards, and was downed. Tech gained 
from 5 to 8 yards every time the ball 
was passed, from now on until they 
reached the 10-yard line, only to suf­
fer the same setback that character­
ized the game, viz., fumbling at cru­
cial point's. Kiski kicked, without at­
tempting to rush the ball. Wright 
failed to catch the punt, and Kiski’s 
fast' end, Andrews, ran for a touch­
down. The remainder of the half 
was played in Kiski’s territory. When 
the whistle blew for time, the Tech 
team was near their opponent’s goal 
line.
The second half opened with a 
rush. The Tech boys resolved to win. 
Tech kicked off to Kiski. The ball 
was received by Lytle, who war. 
downed almost in his tracks. Kiski 
failed to gain, and Kumler kicked for 
•50 yards. Wright made a brilliant 
run of 20 yards, was downed, and 
then began a series of short line 
plunges, which netted 30 yards for 
Tech. More fumbling spoiled Tech’s 
chances of scoring at this point, fcr 
Kumler punted the ball far out of his 
own territory. Adams received the 
kick, and Tech, by trying several 
good trick plays, worked the ball 
back to the center of the field. Tech 
was weakened at this point by the 
injury of Adams, who was substitut­
ed by Ramp. The ball was kept go­
ing back and forth from Tech’s ter­
ritory to the middle of the field, by 
Kumler’s kicking and Tech’s ground 
gaining. The game closed with the 
ball on Kiski’s 4-yard line.

PIONEER TECH CLUB.
Under the auspices of the director, 
the first of a number of houses has 
b^en started for the puipcse of fur­
nishing room and board to the out-of- 
town students and to bring about a 
closer social life between the resi­
dent and non-resident men. The plan 
was projected last spring and worked 
out during the summer months, 
so that the house was practically 
ready for the students upon their re­
turn to school. The following men 
comprise the charter members of the 
“Pioneers”: Dr. Taylor, president;
Tingley, secretary; Sampson, treas­
urer; Jones, Ramp, Kohler, Peebles, 
Westbrook, Schumacher, Weick, 
Watrous. Ketter. Chancellor. Walton 
and Zitterman. The club has a house­
keeper and cook, and being only 
about five minutes’ walk from the 
schools, they are able to get all three 
meals at their house.
As fast as suitable houses can be 
found other clubs of this character 
will be started, as the undoubted ad­
vantages of membership in one of 
them appeals strongly to the student 
body. The “Pioneers” are talking of 
having a certain evening of every 
week in which they will hold “op- n 
house,” to which all C. T. S. stu­
dents are heartily welcome.

Anyone playing the guitar or mando­
lin is kindly requested to come around 
to the rehearsals. A director is to 
-be secured in the near future to suc­
ceed Taxis, last year’s leader, who is 
too busy to fill the position.
It will be but a short time before 
the club will be giving us a surprise 
in the form of some first-class music. 
Time of rehearsals will be posted reg­
ularly on the bulletin boards.
THE THEATER PARTY.
On the night of Saturday, October 
20, the day school of applied science 
attended the Nixon theater in a body. 
Tech was very much in evidence dur­
ing the entire performance, and it 
was the unanimous feeling amongst 
the fellows that it was a royal gcod 
time.
Barney Oldfield, who drove the 
winning car in the auto race, had 
the plaid colors on the front of his 
machine, and when the fellows saw 
the Tartan in the lead they naturally 
went wild. “Rah! Rah! Rah! Tech!" 
and “Rah! Rah! Rah! Oldfield!” re 
sounded throughout the house. Miss 
Elsie Janis, who played the star role, 
came before the footlights in the last 
act with a beautiful bouquet of flow­
ers tied with the school colors, which 
was very pleasing to all the students. 
Cheers for W. U. P., Kiski and Miss 
Janis were given, together with many 
long Techs; the new school song was 
also sung, accompanied by the or­
chestra.
If the Mechanicals have formed 
any society, it must be a secret one. 
for our reporters have been unable 
to get wind of any such organiza­
tion. Perhaps the Mechanicals are 
too busy figuring stresses, etc., to 
think of such trivial matters.
J*
It is understood that the fellows 
have organized themselves into what 
promises to be a very interesting and 
much-needed adjunct to the student 
organizations. Through the efforts of 
Mr. Hudson, ex-president of Plebes, a 
debating society has been formed,

ATHLETICS.
It seems to be the general opinion 
and feeling amongst the night stu­
dents that the day students wish to 
keep themselves apart in athletics, 
and in fact all school organizations. 
The editors of The Tartan believe 
that this is wholly a false impression 
upon the Night School’s part. The 
day students feel themselves esnecial- 
ly in need of the Night School’s as­
sistance in all school matters, and 
hail their co-operation in all things 
with delight. In football especially 
they feel the need of the brawn and 
muscle of the night students, and it 
has made the football nv'n, coach 
and captain look upon the fme lot 
cf material that the Night School has 
to offer with longing eyes. We firm- 
ly believe that bad we had this same 
co-operation of which we speak, that 
the result of the W. U. P. game would 
have been different; for it is a known 
fact that many of the Night School 
men have played on fast teams, and 
those who havp not. have the building 
for fine football men. Let us see 
many more of the night men out on 
the football field, helping the team 
along, and making a name athletically 
for old “Tech.”
jt
LOYALTY TO OUR TEAM.
All the men who attended the W. 
U. P. game-were amply rewarded for 
their loyalty to the team. Everyone 
was overjoyed at the excellent work, 
both offensive and defensive, done by 
the warriors of the gridicrn. But' it 
was a shame that our student bodv 
did not turn out in larger numbers. If 
the students wish to have a wimr'ng 
team they simply must turn out and 
support the team, both financially and 
by their presence at the games.
To be sure, some of the men could 
not possibly spare the money, but 
the big majority of them could, and 
it was their duty to put in an appear­
ance.
ANNOUNCEMENT.
Acting under the advice of a- very 
gcod fr'end of the schools, the man­
agement has decided to run, regular­
ly, a series of ca: toons pertaining 
to events hàpoening in and around 
the schools. We trust that any one 
who is hit by any of the sketches 
will take it in the same spirit with 
which they are published, that of the 
best of wishes and good humor.
We wish to make these car teens a 
feature of the “Tartan,” and any sug­
gestions offered by the students as to 
what they think would be good sub­
jects and of general interest, will be 
grratly appreciated by the publish­
ers.
Our Cartoonist.
The “Tartan” was very fortunate 
m securing the services of Mr. Ma- 
Whlnney, whose work along this line 
has already received considerable 
notice. Mr. MaWhinney is a Pitts­
burg man, at present employed in 
the art department of the Westing- 
house Company. He is a student of 
the night school of applied design, 
and as such, will be in close touch 
with things pertaining to the Tech.
¿8
DORMITORIES.
A new dormitory is being started 
in the near vicinity of the one already 
in existence. We believe these dor­
mitories will be the means of bring­
ing the men closer together and help 
in the creation of a better school 
spirit.

CRUCIBLE DANCE.
On Tuesday, October 31, the Cru­
cibles have planned their first infor­
mal reception and dance, to be held 
in the hall at Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie Technical School. The 
chemists have invited the girls of 
Section A, together with members of 
the faculty in the chemical depart­
ment. This is the first attempt by 
the students in attacking the social 
problem, and it is hoped that the 
other clubs will follow the chem­
icals’ lead, and do something in this 
line. Messrs. Jamieson, Schumacher 
and Steen will furnish the music, 
and a light eolation will be served 
during the evening.

NIGHT SCHOOL OF APPLIED SCI­
ENCE.
On October 15th the Night School 
of Applied Science, first year men, 
were addressed by the Director in the 
Assembly Room, at 7:30. About two 
hundred men were present. The Di­
rector pointed out the chances the 
men had to gain a technical educa­
tion, urging them to gather all the 
information possible from the asking

NIGHT SCHOOL OF APPLIED DE­
SIGN.
The plan and order problem of Class 
B arrived last Saturday and was dis­
tributed to the students. It is pr«, 
dieted that the result of this problem 
will reflect great honor to our men 
in the Architectural Department, if 
we can place as a criterion the stand­
ard of the work rendered on the first 
problem of last fall. The Carnegie 
Technical Schools had a greater men­
tion than any other school in the 
country, and we hope and truly be­
lieve that' this success was merely a 
stepping stone to greater ones.

their work was satisfactory they could 
become regular students for next 
year.

ARCHITECTS
On October 25th the Architectural 
Qlaas, comprising both Junior and 
Plebe classes, met and formed an or­
ganization. after, the manner of all 
schools of architecture. The mem­
bers were given a talk by Mr. Good­
win, who told of the gcod accom­
plished by some of the societies in 
Boston Tech and the University of 
Pennsylvania. After Mr Goodwin’s 
talk, Mr. St'en was elected temporary 
chairman, for the puroose of electing 
class officers. The election resulted 
in favcr of the following men: ^
M. C. Spavr nrcs’dent; A. G. La- 
mont, vice president: G. H. Stoner, 
secretary; A. Z. Harrison, treasurer.
A committee was appointed to draw 
ui) a constitution and by-laws, with 
Mr. Steen as chairma-’1. This com­
mittee is to hand in its report inside 
of two we^Vs. The boys expect first- 
class results from their society, as 
drawing contests will be held fre­
quently, thus arousing a friendlv ri­
valry a^one the members. The so­
cial part of the organization is, of 
course, b"fore their minds, and a se­
ries of entertainments and smokers 
will be held during the coming year, 
at which all their student friends
will be welcome.

THE ELECTRICAL SOCIETY.
The program committee of this so­
ciety are arranging a very interesting 
schedule, which, if carried out, will be 
of great interest to its members. It 
is understood that their first meeting 
will be held in the immediate future, 
when a number of interesting papers 
will be read, followed by a general 
discussion by its members.

CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY.
The next meeting of the Civil Engi­
neering Society will be held at the 
home of Dr. Thayer on November 10. 
The society have arranged matters 
so as to have Director Hamerschlag 
attend the meetings and deliver a 
short address to its members. This 
society has gone at things in a sys­
tematic manner, and are obtaining 
good results, and bid fair to outrival 
the other class societies in many 
ways.
We hope the men in the other en­
gineering branches will wake up, and 
appreciate the good that can be de­
rived from this form of organizations.
It is understood that within a very 
short time the girls of the Marga-ret 
Mcrriscn Carnegie School for Women 
intend organizing a basket ball team. 
As they put it, they ;ntend to mak’ 
it superior to any othe.’ girls’ team 
in the counJry. They say this may 
found lire boasting, yet considering 
that many of the girls have played 
before, they have no hesitation in 
faying that they will fulfill their 
purpose. As cne girl puts it, “We do 
not intend to maltreat or lill sm 
person in our scrimmagps (at least 
not wilfully), but we do intend to put 
into the game all th~ enthusiasm a-a:l 
vim necessary to carry off honors.”

GIRLS’ SCHOOL GLEE CLUB.
Oil Tuesday, October 16th, the Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie School for 
Women Glee Club was organized, and 
has at present a membership of some 
twenty girls. Miss Stuts, of the Fac­
ulty, has kindly consented to be di­
rector. and it is said that with her 
experience in this line of work, she 
will have no equal in carrying the 
girls through to perfection. Miss Sel- 
heimer is business manager. Miss 
Munson, of the Faculty, and Miss 
Pfeil have offered their services as 
accompanists. The first meeting was 
a howling success. Very good collec­
tions of songs have been procured, 
and it is exnected that this adjunct 
to the school organizations will ma­
terially add to the social life of the 
school.

noon was spent.

Some of the boys have seen fit to 
jeer at our maiden efforts to root, but 
we have not take noffense. We re­
alize that there is room for improve­
ment, and we are having special 
training by one of their own num­
bers. This will, of course, effectually 
stop the jeers.

Who knows “Mississippi Bubbles?”
Mr. Sharpe, the sharp chef, took 
the sharp D class to the wholesale 
meat house October 24. One of the 
sharp girls was sharp enough not to 
like hogs’ heads, but Mr. Sharpe was 
sharp enough to give the young lady 
in question a sharp piece of the pig- 
snouts without the girl detecting the 
sharp trick.
In a lecture the other day. we got 
an interesting side-light cn the his­
tory of a member of our A class. She 
frankly assured the professor: “I
was always a wide-awake little 
thing.”
We notice that the Crucibles a^e

social side of their organization—all 
work and no play, you know.

bles’ friends hope and trust that his 
father will have a speedy recovery.
