Until Thiel Game 
Saturday
Wednesday, January 29, Carnegie 
Tech’s basketball squad dropped a 
contest to the powerful, Westminster 
quintet 29-20. Coach Hogan used a 
new combination, but it failed to 
live up to his expectations, and 
could not.1 penetrate the Titan defense 
for a single field goal in the entire 
first half. Captain Neasc, who has 
been the mainstay of the Skibos, 
was shifted to guard and although 
he played a fine defensive and pass­
ing game failed to get his cus­
tomary number of baskets.
The visitors swung into action soon 
after the initial whistle had blown 
and soon held r. very comfortable 
lead. Crowell and O’Donuvan ac­
counted for most of the points, but 
every man in the Westminster line­
up was successful in at least one 
attempt, while the Tartans had to 
content themselves with four widely 
scattered one pointers in the opening 
frame. With the score 21-4 against 
them they staged a comback which 
provided a thrill for the Plaid sup­
porters and a scare for the visiting 
quintet. Merten started the scoring in 
the second half with two good 
throws from the foul line and fol­
lowed these with a pretty field goal. 
A minute later Webster followed 
suit with another two-pointer to re­
vive the hopes of his teammates. The 
Presbyterians took time out in order 
to check the Carnegie rally, but after 
play was again resumed Elmer 
Schumacher proved that lie is more 
than just a good defensive guard by 
adding a couple of two-,pointers and 
a foul to the rapidly increasing Tar­
tan score. With the score 27-15 the 
invading Titans started to play a 
defensive game which enabled" them 
to l.old the lead when the final 
whistle blew. Although the Skibos 
were outclassed in the opening stanza, 
they clearly illustrated that the team 
was not the kind that gives up, 
which is, after all, the biggest thing 
in athletics. A coach that can in­
still in his men these qualities of 
courage and manhood is doing a 
great deal for the reputation of the 
school. Every Carnegie student 
should be proud of the spirit shown 
by the team and back the members

R. S. Hitchcock 
Demonstrates His 
Synthetic Music
R. S. Hitchcock, a research 
physicist for Westinghouse, demon­
strated “Synthetic Music” in Room 
209, Engineering Hall, last Tues­
day evening.
He reproduced the tones of Big 
Ben from a phonograph record and 
then imitated these tones with his 
apparatus. According to Mr. 
Hitchcock the difference between 
the synthetic and rea'l tones lies 
in the fact that the hum, overtone, 
strike note, etc. of the real tones 
die away at different rates, while 
¦with his apparatus they die away 
simultaneously.
After his Big Ben imitation, Mr. 
Hitchcock discussed organs. He 
compared his apparatus to an or­
gan, giving some of its advantages 
and disadvantages over an organ. 
One of the biggest difficulties with 
his apparatus is keeping it in 
tune. Its greatest advantage lies 
in the fact that its tune elements 
can be placed anywhere, a fact 
that is not true of an organ. If 
low tones are desired, his appara­
tus has a great advantage both* in 
size and in price over other types 
of equipment. In an organ it is 
often hard to change the volume 
without changing the pitch; music 
made by clcctrical circuits, on the 
other hand, can easily be -hanged 
in volume without changing the 
pitch.
NOTICE
There will be no issue of 
The T^artan on February 11. 
Reporters- will get their assign­

Plebes to Don Costumes 
in Annual Parade Frolic
The Plebs Prom, known in 
former years as All-Fool’s Day, 
has been revived and once more 
the yearling class will don cos­
tumes and march in parade.
On Tuesday, February 18, the 
freshmen -will be excused from 
class at 11:10 and will don their 
gala attire and appear in their 
separate college assembly rooms 
to be judged by the upper 
classes. The 30 who win the, 
most applause will receive 
exemption cards from regula­
tions for the remainder of the 
year.
The entire class will then 
meet in front of Arts Building 
and led by a clown band will 
march to the gym, where the 
drama department will stage a 
program of humorous skits. The 
plebcs should begin to plan 
their ideas immediately as parti­
cipation is compulsory, and then 
again those/ exemptions are to 
be desired. A limited number 
of plcbcs in each college will be 
exempt for the rest of the year.
CORRECTION
The Statistics course, which 
will be taught in Margaret Mor­
rison next semester, is not open 
to Engineering and Industries 
students, as was stated in the 
last issue of The Tartan.

Student Council 
Recognizes New 
Printing Honorary
City Council Will Not Install 
Forbes and Morewood 
Traffic Light
At the meeting of Student 
Council, January 28, Pi Alpha 
Delta, an honorary printing fra­
ternity, was recognized. This fra­
ternity will succeed Graphica, a 
society composed of any member 
of the printing department who 
cared to join. Pi Alpha Delta has 
set up rigid scholarship require­
ments which vary according to the 
class to which the prospective 
member belongs. Other require­
ments of the group arc a high 
moral standard and a pleasing per­
sonality. Calls to membership can 
be extended to a certain percent­
age of the department, and may be 
extended to members of the print­
ing short course.
Mr.. Davis reported at this meet­
ing that a request of the trustees 
to have a traffic light installed at 
Forbes street and Morewood ave­
nue has been refused. The matter 
has now been taken up with the 
Chairman of Council, and it is 
hoped that further efforts of the 
trustees will meet with success.
Owing to the period of examina­
tions and registration, Council 
voted to hold its next meeting on 
February 18. Any urgent business 
which arises in the meantime will 
be handled by the Executive Com­
mittee of the Student Council.

Life, Thurs., Feb. 21
The Debating Club of Margaret 
Morrison will hold its next meet­
ing on Thursday, February 21, at 
12:30 in the Faculty Room of 
Carnegie Inn. The tentative adop­
tion of the luncheon meeting has 
proved extremely popular and will 
probably be continued throughout 
the remainder of the }rear. The 
subject for the next debate is: 
“Resolved That Dormitory Life Is 
Essential To A Successful College 
Career.” The affirmative side of 
the debate will be represented by 
Dorothy Carey and Janet Bish, 
and the negative by Zarelda Mazza 
and Mabel Hover.
The club, formed last May and

AL KATZ AND HIS KITTENS
Richard Barnhart, Soph. Metallurgist, Wins Scholarship
Richard M. Barnhart of Monon- 
gahcla, Pa., a sophomore in the 
Department of Mining and Mctal- 
urgical Engineering at the Carne­
gie Institute of Technology, has 
been awarded the National Scholar­
ship of $500 offered by the 
Woman’s Auxiliary to the Ameri­
can Institute of Mining and Metal- 
urigical Engineers. The scholar­
ship is effective during the jrear 
1930-31.
Mr. Barnhart is the second stu­
dent from Western Pennsylvania 
to win this honor, the first being 
Fenton H. Finn in 1927, also a 
Carnegie Tech student. All stu­
dents of mining, metallurgy and 
geology throughout :tlie United 
States are eligible to compete for 
these awards, ‘ which are based pri­
marily on scholarship.
The Woman’s Auxiliary to the 
American Institute of Mining and 
Metallurgical Engineers ¿is a na­
tional organization with head­
quarters in New York ©ty. Mrs. 
Herbert Hoover was president at 
the time her 'husband was elected 
president of the United States, and 
she has since been made- honorary 
president. There are twenty or 
more local sections of the Aux­
iliary in the country.
Y M. C. A. PLANS TO 
AID NEW ENTRANTS
The Freshman Cabinet of the 
Y. M. C. A. will welcome to Car­
negie the students entering here 
for the first time in February. A 
dinner is being planned and a 
program similar to that given in 
September will be followed on a 
smaller scale. While in line- wait­
ing to register, the mid-term en­
trants will be aided and advised« 
concerning the matter of registra­
tion and scheduling.
To'students who do not live in 
Pittsburgh, the aid given by the 
“Y” is especially helpful. After 
registration the Senior Y. M. C. A. 
cabinet entertains the freshman and 
aids them in becoming acquainted 
in Pittsburgh and with the Pitts­
burgh district.
Scientific Use Of Trade-Credit

nitcly achieved. And this by the 
universal and only means by which 
every science has definitively ad­
vanced. This is by careful mea­
surement, and.equally careful 
weighing and examination of the 
numerical results.” He cited the 
work of Copernicus regarding the 
solar system; Galileo and the tel- 
scopc, Newton and the law of 
gravity, as examples wherein con­
ditions always in force had been 
measured or used to effect sudden 
great advancement, and suggested 
the possibility that a revolution 
similar to these might be wrought 
in the field of economics by ac­
curate measurement of the growth 
of trade, and application of the 
figures so obtained to the trade- 
crcdit ratio.But Mr. Snyder went further 
than merely to state this possibility. 
He showed how, in his opinion, it 
was slowly becoming a reality. He 
claimed that there is a very fine 
adjustment between the amount of 
bank credit and the reserves held

“The statistical control of neither 
industry nor credit, or both, will 
bring about the millennium, but it 
will surely serve long to maintain 
our leadership in that unparalleled 
industrial advance which has rmide 
this nation the marvel and the 
envy of the world,” said Carl 
Snyder, Statistician of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, in 
concluding the lecture scries he 
presented in the Union last week.
Mr. Snyder used as his thesis 
the trade-crcdit ratio, and explained 
the history of its development, its 
importance, and the determination 
of the data necessary for its effec­
tive operation.
Scientific Analogy
In order to illustrate his' ideas, 
Mr. Snyder presented an analogy 
in physics. lie said: “Is economics 
in its most ancient, central and 
important field never to become a 
science, but only to remain an end­
less war of. words, opinions, and 
fancies? I do not feel so dubious; 
I am here even to suggest to you 
that the end is near, if not dcfi-
Newman Club To Practical Work
Entertain Feb. 14
The annual Valentine Dance of 
the Newman Chib of Pittsburgh 
will be held in the Knights of 
Columbus Ball Room, Fifth and 
Bellefield avenues, February 14. 
The reception committee is to be 
made up of alumni of the New­
man Club and many of the old 
members will be present to greet 
old friends and to renew acquaint­
ances in the Club.
Gerald Doran, of Carnegie, is in 
charge of the decorations and they 
will*" be quite elaborate and fitting 
for the occasion. Henry Stafford, 
of Duquesne, is the general chair­
man of the committees in charge 
of the dance. The orchestra has 
not been chosen yet, but the com­
mittee is considering the choice of 
one of the best orchestras in the 
Pittsburgh District.
The Club has made definite ar­
rangements to hold a theater party 
in the Pitt Theater, Monday eve­
ning, March 3. The play, which 
will be • presented by the George 
Sharp Players, has not vet been 
announced.
Goes To Juniors
Five juniors in Aeronautical En­
gineering have recently been em­
ployed for some experimental 
work on the airplanes being made 
at the Joy Manufacturing Com­
pany, Franklin, Pa. These stu­
dents' are working at the plant 
over the week-end, and are en­
gaged at present in making the 
stress analysis of a recently finish­
ed biplane.
This co-operative work, the first 
sponsored by the recently formed 
Aeronautical Engineering Depart­
ment, is in fesponse to the in­
creasing demands from the busi­
ness world for technical under­
graduates. An ever increasing list 
is being formed of companies seek­
ing students for part time work in 
aviation and wind tunnel research.
Present developments have re­
sulted in several seniors and a 
number of juniors being engaged 
for summer work in the wind 
tunnel, which is rapidly being com­
pleted in the basement of Machin­
ery Hall.
M. Henri Matisse Will Be Carnegie Institute Guest
Iienri Matisse, one of the most 
famous living artists, will visit 
Pittsburgh next September, accord- 
ingg to an announcement made by 
Homer Saint-Gaudcns, Director of 
Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute. 
Matisse has long been looked on 
as the leading French modernist, 
lie will, come to this country as 
the guest of the Carnegie Institute 
to serve on. the Jury of Award for 
the Twenty-ninth Carnegie Insti­
tute International Exhibition of 
Paintings. This will be the second 
time that his name has been asso­
ciated with the Carnegie Institute 
International, for a sensation was 
created in the art world when his 
painting. “Still1 Life,” was awarded 
first prize in the Twenty-sixth 
Carnegie International in 1927. 
Though his Work had received 
wide recognition, the Carnegie 
Prize was the first official reward 
he had ever received.
Iienri Matisse was born on De­
cember- 31, 1869, at Cateau-Cam 
bresis in the northern part of 
France. He first studied law, but 
in 1892 when he went to Paris to 
take his degree, he made up his 
mind to become a painter. . He 
went to the Beaux Arts School 
and studied under such traditional 
masters as Boiiguereau, Gerome,

NEW MATH TEXT
TO BE PUBLISHED
E. M. Starr and E. G. Olds, 
instructors of vocational mathema­
tics in Carnegie Tech night school, 
have recently completed a text­
book for use ‘ in any evening or 
vocational school. The book, “Vo­
cational Mathematics,” will be pub­
lished very soon by P. Blakaistons 
Sons and Company of Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania.
Mr. Starr and Mr. Olds have 
been associated in night school 
work for the past several years and 
have written this book as a 
suit of their mathematical work 
in the Industries College. The 
book contains a thorough review 
of fundamental processes needed 
in all types of vocational work. 
“Vocational Mathematics” will be 
used in Industries night school 
work as soon - as it is published.
Green Imps Orchestra 
Will Play at Tea Dance
On Wednesday, February 12, 
a tea * dance will be given in 
the Carnegie Union. The Green 
Imps, a seven-piece orchestra, 
will furnish the music, and the 
hours will be from 3 to 5:30 
p. m. Ladies arc admitted free 
of charge, but the tax for men 
will be 50 cents.
This darice, which is being 
sponsored by the Carnegie Ath­
letic Association, marks the first 
of a series of tea dances reviv­
ing the functions which attained 
much popularity in past years.
This type of dance is strictly 
informal and is one of the best 
revelry and mixing factors in 
the school. Here students from 
all four classes arid colleges can 
meet and make or revive friend­
ships.
Coming after the rush of final 
exams and registration the dance 
will serve as a pleasant diver­sion.

Song Included
The opening sale of the new 
official Carnegie Song Book will 
take place during February regis­
tration, when, for the first time 
in six 3rears, Carnegie students 
will be offered the opportunity of 
purchasing a book of this nature.
This new edition of the Song 
Book, which is to be about twice 
as large as the first one, will be 
unique both in appearance and con­
tent. The binding will be of blue 
cloth emblazoned with a gold Car­
negie seal. It is to be one of the 
most complete volumes of its kind 
that has ever been published. 
There will be, in addition to the 
entire contents of the first book 
all the songs that have been com­
posed in the past six years, one 
song of each fraternity and soror­
ity on campus, and many Nationally 
famous and favorite songs of other 
schools. Scott’s New Carnegie 
March, Walter Sickle's Plaid Song, 
the revived Alma Mfiter, and the 
quartet arrangement of “Dear Old 
Tech” are all to be included. In 
addition to the songs there will be 
full-page cuts of campus buildings, 
which, together with its other fea­
tures, will make the book a de­
lightful souvenir, of college days. 
No effort or expense is being 
spared by the staff to make this 
book one of the most beautiful as 
well as useful publications ' ever 
published on this campus. The 
book will sell for $1 a copy.
The book is dedicated to John 
L. Porter, chairman of the Board 
of Trustees of Carnegie Tech. Mi 
Porter was the unanimous choice 
of the staff because of ..his untir­
ing . efforts in Carnegie student af­
fairs.
Henry Bunker is editor and Tom 
Lippert business manager. The 
advance sales of the book indicate 
that the effort being put forth by 
these men, together with that of 
the other staff members, will be 
repaid by an enornious demand for 
copies of the book. Many orders 
have already been received from 
alumni, night school students, and 
others who arc displaying keen in­
terest in this new project.

Porter will don their little "red 
hat” and “red suspenders” which 
the boys gave to them as a token 
of their appreciation at the ban­
quet of last year. Each class will 
present a stunt for the evening, 
and probably Porter will sing the 
theme song. Special presentations 
may be made by individuals, and 
this will certainly be a splendid 
opportunity to show some of that 
inherent talent.

Carnegians Will Revel To Music Of Al Katz 
And His Kittens At Men’s Junior Prom Friday
Friday evening will witness the 
most brilliant of the season’s col­
legiate dances in the Men’s Junior 
Prom at the Schenley Hotel. The 
music will be furnished by the 
popular Al Katz and His Kittens 
Columbia Recording Orchestra,1 
known in the States, and in Europe 
for their fine dance music and- un­
usual novelties and comedy. The 
Hotel Sch’cnicy ballroom is being 
especially decorated for the affair 
with palms and ferns. With such 
an ideal - setting and a good crowd 
the Prom is bound to be the sea­
son’s brightest function and out-
standing among Carnegie Tech 
Proms.
Jimmy Traa, president of the 
Industries Junior Class, and Mari,on 
McNary, a Freshman in the Mar­
garet Morrison College, will lead 
the Promenade which will form 
about 11:30. Favors will be dis­
tributed at the conclusion of 'he 
Grande Marche by members of the 
committee. Favors will be given 
only in exchange for the ’ Favor 
Stub which is part of the ticket.
The chaperones for the Prom 
are Mr. and Mrs. R. V. Davis. The 
patrons and patronesses arc: Dr. 
T. S. Baker, Miss Mary Watson
Green, Mr. and Mrs. A. W. Tarbell, 
Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Mott, Mr. apd 
Mrs. A. C. Jewett, Mr. Glendining 
Kccblc,. and Dr. Charles Watkins.
The committee feels that they 
are extremely fortunate in being 
able to secure as renowned an or­
chestra as Al Katz and His Kittens 
to furnish the music for the Prom. 
For two years this orchestra 
played at the 400 Club in Paris. 
While on their extensive European 
tour they played before the Presi­
dent of France and his« Cabinet,

For Thiel Game at Gyro, 
SaturdayMembers o£ the Freshman swim­
ming team will open their 1930 sea­
son Saturday, February 8, with the 
McKinley High School of .Canton, 
Ohio. This trip to Canton will be 
made with the greatest hopes of 
gaining a decision over the school 
boys, for such a result will start 
the Plebes off with a valuable vicr 
tory under their belt.
Strong opposition is expected be­
cause -McKinlcy High is about to 
close their season, and their team 
should be in fine swimming condi­
tion. With the best . part of six 
meets to their credit, there is no 
reason why the Canton boys should 
not set a fast pace for the Plebes 
to overcome. One must- consider 
the fact that the meet takes place 
in foreign waters, and our Fresh­
men, with little experience in com­
petition, may bring home unexpected 
results. With these thoughts in mind, 
the Plebes arc facing a fight for 
recognition.
Coach Riscdorph has selected N. 
Franke, T. Culter, F. Jerge, W. 
Benson, and N. liiguchi for service 
in the relay and free style events. 
T. Bradzill and H. Cadmus arc en­
tered in the back stroke, while S 
Goldberg and E. Baltrusaitis will 
swim the breast stroke. H. Cadmus 
and F. Jerge appear again to strive 
for honors in diving.
Manager Dave Tomer has com­
pleted the Freshman schedule as fol­
lows: Feb. 8, McKinley High, here; 
Feb. 12, Pitt Frosh, there; Feb. 15,

Frosh, here; March 15, Kiski, there.
With the approach of the Pitt meet 
on February 12, the varsity swimmers 
are taking on thr finishing touches.
At a recent meeting of the Ath­

Collegiate Imps Continue 
Engagement at Webster Hall
The original Carnegie Tech or­
chestra. The Collegiate Imps, are 
continuing their engagement at 
Webster Hall. Harold Hunter, a 
senior in the Architectural Depart­
ment, a member of Kappa Sigma 
Fraternity and Scarab Honorary, 
is the leader of the band.
Hunter and his Imps after ca­
pacity opening arc increasing night­
ly in popularity. They play every 
evening for the dinner dancing and 
on Friday and Saturday continue 
throughout the evening for supper 
dancing. With regular broadcasting 
from radio station K. Q. V. the 
orchestra gives to the public that 
slow, melodious music which is 
now in popular favdr. Webster 
Hall from all appearances, is again 
becoming the recreation ccnter for 
students of both Carnegie Tech 
and Pitt.
Notice From Erie Clan 
Indicates Enthusiasm
The meeting of January 22 was a 
great success with thirty seven pres­
ent. Dinner was served at 6:30 after 
which the crowd sang Tech songs, 
played cards and danced. It had 
been hoped that Dr. Baker would 
be present at this meeting, but he 
was not alblc to arrange it, so we 
hope to entertain him at our Feb­
ruary meeting. The secretary, W. A. 
Spangcnbcrg, 337 W. Eleventh street, 
will be pleased to have the Erie 
alumni get in touch with him, in 
case they are not receiving notices 
of these meetings.

looked.
Then too, there is the fellow that 
forgot to provide himself with »lie 
ncccssary evil wherewith to pay his 
share of the weight deposit, -hereby 
forcing the other gents in his. im­
mediate vicinity to skip Experiment 
Two. (No one seems to be willing 
to pay the entire deposit alone, for 
there are too mahy of the same type 
that never buy cigarettes (like my­
self) who would borrow them so 
consistently that the original depositor 
would wonder if there wasn’t some 
mistake.) But this is a minor evil. 
A statistician would go crazy figur­
ing out the number of foot-pound* 
expended by the class in general in 
the various little involuntary jumps 
we give when our immediate neigh­
bor drops a handful of assorted 
crockery and glassware to the* great 
detriment of his deposit card.
Yet, and with it all, it is truly 
surprising how smoothly everything 
is running even at this early date. 
There hasn’t been one of us killed 
| yet. We are all enjoying the best 
of health, due probably to the tact 
that wc aren’t in Lab an hour longer. 
We are coming along fine, and it 
there are any of you who have that 
devil-may-care spirit that scorns 
danger, just come and watch us 
work on one of your off evenings. 
Wc guarantee you the wildest even­
ing you have had since that last 
New Year’s party.
Wc have in us the making of 
great (no, I’m not going to say ’

believe it, we won’t argue. You 
can judge for yourself by the :e 
suits. If you get the impression that 
something crawled into the corridors 
and died, remember that wc all nnke 
mistakes, and it is just one of those 
poor freshmen who got his chemicals 
out of the wrong bottle, and i>

Bernard Smart (Prof.) Vs John 
Dumbcll (Student). No. 1. January 
Term. 1930, in Re Flunck Procedure.
Opinion
By Exam Board, January 27,1927.
1. Libellant seeks to flunk re- 
spondant on the ground of insuf­
ficient studying during the first 
semester.
2. The parties first became ac­
quainted October 2, 1929, and be­
gan their school relationship Octo­
ber 7, 1929.
3. The -case is very unusual in 
that the libellent seeks to flunk 
the / respondent while the latter 
contests the flunk. UNUSUAL? 
I’ll say.
4. The testimony by and in be­
half of the respondant convinces 
us that the libellent did subject 
the respondent to a course-of cruel 
and barbarous treatment, endanger­
ing his life, and offered such indig­
nities to his person as to render, 
his condition intolerable and his 
life burdensome. For instance: 
Too much homework; too many 
recitations; too many exams and 
not enough holidays.
P. S. I can’t think of any more 
can you?
5. The testimony by and in be­
half of the libellent shows us that 
the respondent did subject the li­
bellent to much worry in such a 
way as that the respondent paid 
little attention to classes, refused 
to do any homework, and caused 
the formation of many gray hairs 
on libellent’s head.
6. According to the testimony 
conditions rose to such n extent 
to cause an examination, which was 
•held during the -week of January 
20th.
7. But being convinced that both 
the libellent and respondent were 
equally responsible we refuse to 
award a verdict and hope that con­
ditions will be better during the 
next semester.

And makes the landscape drear?
The grass dissolving, stink evolving 
chemical engineer.The "Plaid” has received several 
complaints recently of the scarcity 
of paper towels in the lavatories 
for the use of the Night Students 
The most recent comes from W. E. 
Z. of Arts who says in part:
"Most of us in Night Arts get 
our hands quite dirty during an 
evening’s work with charcoal and 
paint. It has become necessary for 
us to carry extra handkerchiefs to 
use for towels after class because 
there arc never any paper towels in 
the ¦washrooms.
"I wish the Night Student Coun­
cil or the Faculty would do what 
they can to remedy this matter as 
it is most inconvenient at times.”
W. fc. Z. has given the condition 
as it exists in the Arts building 
and the same is true of Industries 
and Engineering. In the last two 
named ^schools, the students in 
some shops and laboratories get 
quite dirty in their pursuit of 
knowledge. Some of them bring 
soap and towels from home for 
their personal use, for 011 very few 
occasions are there any towels in 
the washrooms and not very, often 
can soap be found.
If this condition is brought to 
the attention of the proper authori­
ties, we believe that it will be rem­
edied. Our suggestion for a jani­
tor to make the rounds of all lava­
tories in his building early in the 
evening and see that all racepticals 
are filled with towels and that an 
ample supply of soap is on hand 
for the use of the Night Students.

was to justify the title. What I mean 
in case you don’t know, is that 
there comes a time in every younR 
man’s life when he gnashes his

to go. If there be any such this 
Saturday night, lie deserves seven 
years solitary confinement. Why? Be­
cause .the second free Night Arts 
Dance comens—pardon me—comes
along this Satdee, the Sth.
These dances really need no ads— 
just ask any one who has attended 
the last ones. Their popularity is 
second to none. Say, what else
could you want? There'll be an
orchestra yclept The RED PEP­
PER Boys. Doesn’t that sound hot! 
And believe me they are. There'll 
be favors. And leave it to the com­
mittee to find the very best 1 They 
never fail. There’ll be refreshments. 
Punch and cakes. Hey! Is there
anything it lacks? No siree!
Well boys, here’s one affair that 
won’t cost you anything. Tickets are 
free to Night Art Students, and if 
you can’t get one use your registra 
tion card. Girls! Here’s your chance 
to treat the boy friend for past 
favors. How can • he refuse? He 
won’t, believe you me.
Then, too, this dance will be hon­
ored by two well-known faculty 
members—Mr. McKinney and Mr. 
Simboli.
So, Night Arts! What are you 
waiting for? Cast business to the 
winds. Let merry-making hold sway. 
•Here’s your latest chance, gang. On 
with the dance! February 8—DeL.
Now, if they say that about a full- 
fledged engineer, what can you ex­
pect of us poor beginners? Dbn’t 
be too harsh in your judgments; you 
may flunk a course yourscii som< 
day. So, after giving all this informa­
tion that enlightens no one, but 
creates a fog tnat a Navy smok>.

here before the «icntlc reader s*nds

that will surpass the Argonne by a« 
much as our vicious attacks tall 
short.
—H.E.M.
rI^he indications arc that this 
year’s Washington’s Birthday dancc 
will surpass all '.previous ones. 
While we do not have any definite 
information from tlie committee 
relative to this function, suffice it 
to say that nothing will be left 
undone by this efficient aggregation 
of night students to make the party 
a glowing success.
Our advice to you is to make ar­
rangements to be present by secur­
ing your “date.” In the next issue 
we hope to have more to disclose.
Could you believe it—I actually 
secured a paper towel in the wash 
room the other evening in ARTS, 
md I surely did make use of it; 1 
don’t know how the rest of the stu­
dents feel about paper towels, but 1 
have come to the conclusion that 
they are as scarce as hen’s teeth. It’s 
rather a hard and tough deal to have 
to leave the school at night with 
.dirty hands, and I suppose 1 will 
have to get my fertile brain (?) 
working so that I can devise a 
Kcheme whereby we will have suf­
ficient towels to go around. I will 
try to have something worked out in 
our next.
in a recent conversation with some 
eight students in Architecture I was 
rather surprised to learn that they al­
most have to have 3 padlocks on their 
boards and lockers in order that they 
tan keep them where they belong. 1 
»m told one student in particular had
u. visitor and a perfectly good set 
nf drawing instruments, “T” Square 
«.nd several other accoutrements 
eecessary to a architect suddenly took 
Bight from his locker. He was very 
ouch handicapped as he was en 
therette. I am sure that the party 
who purloined this equipment will 
kave the good manners to return it: 
Another night 'tudent lost1 a large 
drawing board after the last problem 
mid is still on the lookout for it. 
Hope he finds it. I would suggest 
that they place five locks for safety 
I see that the cars are back in a 
feuddle again in the blind area caused 
by the barrier near ARTS. Up to 
the old tricks again, and why 
shouldn’t they. P.arlcing space is at 
premium, and every. little nook and 
corner is utilized to the utmost. I 
pity the poor fellow who gets on the 
campus after 7 p. m. He doesn’t 
have much of a chance for his 
metal steed. I once heard a pro­
found agrument or suggestion ad­
vanced in the interest of parking on 
the campus, and write it for what 
at is worth. A party in all serious­
ness, after a long drawn out dis­
cussion about the parking situation

HERE they come—the nucleus of an all-electric 
merchant marine. Yesterday, they were a dream. 
To-day, they are well over the horizon, Unking the ports 
of the east and west coasts with fortnightly service. The 
goal of the Panama Pacific Line is to build three more 
turbine-electric ships, thus enabling weekly New York- 
Frisco sailings.
Even now, the three liners, California, Virginia, and 
Pennsylvania, constitute the largest fleet of turbine-electric 
commercial ships in the world.
Besides propelling these ships, electricity hoists freight, 
raises anchors, mans pumps, turns rudders, drives winches, 
and warps the vessels into their berths. It lights lamps, 
spins fans, operates elevators, cools and cooks food. Its 
magic touch is apparent on every deck.
All electric equipment, above and below deck, is a prod­
uct of General Electric.
The planning, production, and distribution of such 
equipment has been largely the responsibility of college- 
trained men who are working with General Electric and 
who have aided in bringing these ships over the horizon.

Member Federal Reserve System
Those of us who were fortunate 
enough to tunc in on the Alabama 
Polytech Prom last Friday evening 
know now "why the ruddy faced 
chairman of the local Junior Prom 
made extra-special efforts to obtain 
Al Katz and all the rest of his 
mice chasers, for the biggest social 
event of the none too eventful 
social season. For those of us 
that listened can tell those of you 
that didn’t that Mr. Katz really 
has something. His "St. James 
Infirmary” and his rendition of the 
cvcr-popular "Tiger Rag” arc good 
enough recommendations ( in them­
selves. Anyone who wants a quick 
and easy way to forget the trials 
and tribulations causcd by Pro­
fessor Geckelcr and his cohorts 
can—two hearts, we’ve just started 
a bridge game—find the way by 
coming to the—bye—Junior Prom

must grow at much the same rate 
as tlic business or trade of the 
nation grows, year by year, and if 
the increase of credit is inadequate, 
business will suffer, and if it is in 
excess we shall have other kinds 
of difficulties leading, for example, 
to just what we have seen in the 
last year, an excess of enthusiasm, 
over-confidence, and a crash.”
Method of Measurement
Of utmost importance, however, 
is the method by which we can 
measure the volume of trade, he 
said. Although excellent composite 
measurements have been made by 
such men as Professors Fisher, 
Kcmmerer, and King, they all deal 
mainly with the business cycle, the 
ups and downs of trade, rather 
tlian "its steady growth. The diffi­
culties in measurement are ex­
tremely great, due to the numerous 
factors that must be considered, 
and the number of them that are. 
untrustworthy, irrelevant, and in­
complete. Mr. Snyder, however, 
believes he has ' found a way to 
make the measurement. He says: 
“Because of these wide discrepan­
cies between different types of 
prices we put together, six or 
eight years ago, most of the then 
available material into a broad 
composite which we rather boldly 
termed the General Price Level. 
Jt was confessedly only an attempt 
towards such an index, to be re­
vised jus't as often as sufficient 
new material was available. Three 
or four such revisions have been 
made, and the index as it stands 
covers some twelve broad divisions, 
made up with weights . . The 
statistician expects that some day 
such an adequate measurement 
may be obtained as to be reliable, 
and applicable to the well-known 
equation, MV==PT, in which M 
stands for total bank deposits, VI 
for rate of turn-over, P for goods, 
services or property exchanged, 
and T for total trade; when the 
growth of trade* can-be measured, 
then, the equation will bo solved 
and business stability (not price- 
iixing) should result

Play Review
Those of you who were not too busy studying for exams 
probably viewed with varying amounts of pleasure the piece on 
display at the Little Theater last week. The more studious 
among you were sagacious in your choice of occupation; for 
had you ventured forth from your study chambers you would 
most certainly not have been presented with a very adequate 
lesson in dramatic art. There were laughs aplenty and several 
rather poignant moments when you could truly say that some­
thing rather good was taking place, but considered as an en­
tirety the only adjective that we can think of is—indeterminate.
Perhaps when Mr. Rice and his colleague, Mr. McKee, took 
their copies of “The Three Musketeers” down from the shelf 
and dusted them off they already knew whether they wanted to 
write a bit of satire or farce or straight comedy. Perhaps, we 
say, for we are of the opinion that they didn’t. No one, nowa­
days, is that good at keeping a secret. Surely had they had 
something really definite in mind they would have dropped just 
the most subtle of hints to the audience. In all seriousness any­
one with a sense of propriety wants to know, when he is 
amused, whether the amusement is legitimate or otherwise, 
whether to be more precise it is intentional. The several Ana­
chronisms, although quite clever, onljt added to our difficulty in 
getting straightened out. Also there were one or two of these 
that might or might not have been intentional.
The fault of some of this indefiniteness may also lie with 
Mr. Hickman. Surely he could have helped us classify the play 
had lie been so minded. Maybe a game was being played and 
our sense of humor is failing us. In other respects it was a 
godd enough piece of direction. The sets were attractive, al­
though they naturally suffered by comparison with those of the 
recent musical comedy which we suppose they were meant to 
resemble.
The hero and heroine, Mr. BonhofT and Miss McCann,' 
handled their parts with facility, as did Mr. Johns as Athos and 
Miss Franklin as Anne of Austria. There was plenty of nimble 
sword-play, but the dancing was very poor. It added nothing at 
all, but rather killed the opening scene which should have had 
the effect of an operetta, but in reality was extremely flat. The 
organ music was all right, but when isn’t the “March of the 
Musketeers” all right?

that although an excessive varia­
tion in the tradc-credit tratio was 
responsible for the recent market

responsible for its occurrence at 
that time. He refused to comment

Dear Cardo: The 31 of January 
made me realize that New Year’s 
is long past, but I really did make 
a New Year’s resolution to study 
harder and get better grades. Still, 
I really can’t help wondering some­
times "what’s the use, especially 
since I am in a fraternity now 
where I can have such a good 
time.—Tom Plcbc.
Dear Thisty: My New Yearns
resolution was not to push- into 
line ahead of people when I am 
trying to get some lunch- in a 
hurry at the Grill, but I was in 
such a hurry the other noon, and I 
was so hungry that I just natur­
ally joined Elsie, who was almost 
at the counter, although the end 
of the line was way back, and I 
heard some perfectly horrid boys 
say that I had a bad complexion 
and that it served me right for 
shoving in ahead of other hungry 
people, and I think that was just 
rotten of them because I don’t 
usually get ahead of people in 
line, and I really believe that girls 
shouldn’t do it, and I hardly ever 
do it myself.—Mae.
Dear Sir: I made a New Year's 
resolution to find out who you 
are.—From the Fence.
Dear Mr. Disenwollc: I made
a New. Year's resolution to pass 
freshman math, but somehow I 
don’t feel that that’s enough. Do 
you- think it would do any goo'd ^o 
tell the department about my reso­
lution? Perhaps you would pub­
lish it in your column and let them 
know about me that way.—Tim 
Cosine.
Dear C. C. D.: I resolved on
New Year’s to stop reading your 
foolish column, but I've broken 
the resolution already', because I 
find it can’t help reading your, silly 
drivel.Dear Thistledown: I made a
New Year’s resolution to stop 
smoking so many cigarettes each 
day, but when I. saw a kind adver­
tised in Vanity Fair that I’d nevei 
tried to smoke, I felt f must bu> 
a package, and I liked them so 
much that I’ve smoked almost a 
package a day ever since. T a 
my mind Vanity Fair is a cor­
rupting magazine.—Lucile.
Dear Card: One of my New
Year's resolutions was to give the 
upperclassmen in my fraternity 
fewer chances to give me black 
marks, but, I think of it painfully,
I haven’t succeeded very' well.— 
Bill Angle.
Dear Dizzy: So many of the
professor’s jokes arc bad that I 
made a New Year's resolution 
never to laugh at another, but Mr. 
XXX made such a funny one the 
other day that I couldn’t help 
laughing at it, and he looked at 
me as if .he were surprised I’d seen 
the point of it.
Dear Mr. Thistledown: I made 
a fervent New Y’car’s rcsolution- 
not to have so many dates each 
week this semester as I had last, 
but how can I refuse Tom’s invi­
tations to darwccs when I think 
how tall and handsome lie is in a 
tuxedo, and I have to. let Bill take 
me to the talkies lie has such 
a nice fur coat—I mean fb fcela 
so nice when you are sitting elose 
beside him—and I have to let 
Camel take nje to those Sun­
day afternoon organ recitals (I do 
like to be going around with at 
least one man who is interested in 
what you might call the uplifting 
things in life), and Gladys is al­
ways having bridges where I met 
,the nicest engineers—well, you see 
what can happen to a New Y'car’s 
resolution.
Thistledown, in conclusion, will 
be glad. to hear from any of his 
readers who have kept any of the 
resolutions they made while the 
whistles were blowing or from any 
of his readers who find their exami­
nations simple- and easy.
