Student group speaks out on behalf of North Korean refugees
Ribbons graced the Cut last week as a reminder of events in North Korea.

Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon chapter of Libera­
tion in North Korea (LiNK) promoted North 
Korea awareness last week by displaying 98 
ribbons on the Cut, one for each North Ko­
rean that dies per hour from starvation.
Young Ko, a fifth-year architecture major 
and the coordinator and founder of the LiNK 
chapter, believes the ribbons serve as a re­
minder.
“Not only are we speaking out for 23 mil­
lion North Koreans and 250,000 refugees, 
who are. largely suffering from human rights 
violations both in the nation and in hiding, 
but we also want to [remind] them that they 
are not forgotten,” he said.
LiNK also encouraged awareness by plac­
ing posters on easels along the Cut, providing
a free showing of Seoul Train, a documentary 
about North Korea, and tabling for donations 
for Safe Haven, a project that provides shel­
ter, food, and support to North Korean refu­
gees in China.
This was LiNK’s first public demonstration 
on campus, and Ko considers it a success.
“We were really reaching out to people,” 
Ko said. “People would come up to our table 
and tell us they saw the ribbons and photos 
on the Cut and ask us how they could help.”
This kind of awareness was not always 
easy to find. Carnegie Mellon’s LiNK, which 
got its start two years ago, has only now re­
ally begun to get its name out.
The inspiration to start a chapter began in 
the summer of 2004. Ko felt moved to bring 
the cause to Carnegie Mellon after talking 
with two friends, who were both involved 
with LiNK at other universities.
At this point, LiNK, a non-profit, non-gov­
ernment, and non-religious ' organization 
headquartered in Washington, D.C., was 
spreading worldwide.
“I felt like I needed to be a voice for the 23 
million people of North Korea,” Ko said. “I 
couldn’t be silent.”
That winter he met with Inyoung Song, 
now a senior policy and management major, 
and established'LiNK as a student organiza­
tion on campus.
For Ko and Song, fhe toughest obstacle 
has been the apathy of Carnegie Mellon stu­
dents.
“You put up a poster, people look at it, but 
don’t do anything,” Song said.
The level of apathy is matched with the 
level of ignorance. Too few people know 
about the true state of North Korea,, he said.
Ko recalled that even growing up in South

New controversial 
speakers policy 
awaits approval
by Sarah Mogin
Assistant Pillbox Editor 
& Maria Zayas 
Junior Staffwriter
Following extensive research 
last winter, the Controversial 
Speakers Policy Committee has 
finalized its proposal to replace 
the current controversial speak­
ers policy. The new document, 
called the Policy on Freedom of 
Expression, is now awaiting the 
approval of several groups of 
students and faculty.
As it stands, the controversial 
speakers policy does not. limit 
visiting speakers. If enacted, 
the uew policy will not add any 
restrictions to that right.
“Any group can invite any­
body to the campus,” said Wil­
liam Brown, the chair of the 
Controversial Speakers Policy 
Committee and a biology pro­
fessor. “We believe that the stu- 
% dents have the right to hear all 
points of view.”
The new policy is also in­
tended to replace the univer­
sity’s Freedom of Speech and 
Assembly Policy, one closely 
related to the subject of contro- 
, versial speakers.
“The two policies were al­
ways presented in tandem, 
but this combined them,” said 
Michael Murphy, university as­
sociate vice-president and com­
mittee member. “Both need to 
be understood.”
As a supplement to the pro­
posed policy, the committee 
drafted a set of guidelines 
called “Considerations in Plan­
ning Campus Events.”
“We said we don’t want them 
to be part of the policy because 
we don’t necessarily want them 
to be law,” Brown said. “Every 
time you start writing down 
something, then people start 
trying to figure out how to get 
around it.”
The considerations are mostly 
to guard against the poten­
tial irresponsibility of visiting 
speakers, Brown explained.
“Anytime you bring a speaker 
to campus — anytime you have 
an activity — there are certain 
things you need to plan for,” 
he said. “That includes where 
you’re having it, who you’re af­
fecting, and all those kinds of 
things.”
Brown stressed that the pro-

After a long day of chasing 
the Green Goblin, Spiderman 
made his way to the Children’s 
Hospital of Pittsburgh to pay a 
special visit to his biggest fan, 
Noah Rheinländer, on Saturday 
afternoon.
Noah is a three-and-a-half- 
year-old leukemia patient. Spi­
derman is a sophomore in drama 
named Ian Harding.
Last week, Noah’s aunt, Joanne 
Rheinländer, contacted people 
in the School of Drama with an 
unusual request: She wondered 
if an actor would dress up as Spi­
derman to cheer up her nephew, 
who recently underwent a stem 
cell transplant to treat his second 
bout with leukemia.

Students, parents, faculty, 
and staff gathered in Rangos 
Ballroom for Carnegie Mellon’s 
annual undergraduate tuition 
meeting last Tuesday night. Bill 
Elliott, the university’s vice- 
president for enrollment and 
the meeting’s host, reported that 
Carnegie Mellon’s tuition sur­
passed that of all its peer institu­
tions for the first time this year.
First-year students paid 
$34,578 in tuition and fees, 
compared to this year’s average 
tuition rate among competitors 
of $31,805.
The meeting included pre­
sentations by several notable 
members of the administra­
tion, each measuring the uni­
versity’s growth in a different 
way. Melissa Tanto, an analysist 
for Institutional Research and 
Analysis, evaluated Carnegie 
Mellon’s performance in the most 
recent rankings by U.S. News & 
World Report. Elliott reported 
on this year’s tuition rates and 
those of our peer comparison 
schools. Provost and Senior Vice- 
President Mark Kamlet spoke 
about Carnegie Mellon’s strate­
gic initiatives, and Vice-Presi- 
dent and Chief Financial Officer 
Deborah Moon presented an 
overview of the university’s fi­
nancial pressures.

munity in attendance then of­

issues presented.
This year’s tuition marks an 
increase of nearly 8 percent over 
last year’s rates, Elliott said. Over 
the past 10 years, Carnegie Mel­
lon’s tuition rate has increased 
41 percent, compared with 38 
percent among the university’s 
peers.
Carnegie Mellon’s small 
endowment in relation to its 
peer institutions is partly to 
blame for this gap, Kamlet ex­
plained in his presentation titled

all drama students. Harding was 
the first to respond.
“I’ve never done anything like 
this before,” Harding said. “But I 
thought, ‘Sure, I’ll do it.’”
In a matter of days, Harding 
obtained a Spiderman costume, 
did some background research 
on Spiderman, and watched the 
first Spiderman movie to get even 
more tips.
Harding did not expect that 
Noah’s first reaction would be 
one of fear.
“Noah didn’t know what to 
think when he first heard that 
Spiderman was coming to visit 
him,” Noah’s mother, Danielle 
Rheinlander, said. “It was a little 
too much for him to grasp.” 
Slowly, with the combined ef­
fort of his mother, grandmother, 
aunt, and Spiderman, Noah be­
gan to open up.

At a public park in the Bronx, Toumani 
straddles a Djembe drum bigger than 
he is. His head is tilted upward, and his 
eyes are closed; the pose makes him 
look like Ray Charles as he thumps out 
a beat. Joei giggles as she uses chop­
sticks to hold the spoon with which 
she eats her brunch in Queens. James 
lies flopped on the carpet of a Brooklyn 
science exhibit; his palms are up and 
his expression is matter-of-fact as his 
mother stands over him waiting.
They’re three photographs in a series 
that photographer Danny Goldfield is 
slowly creating. He has taken 132 so far, 
and he has 62 to go.
Goldfield is photographing children 
who live in New York City and come 
from each of the 194 countries on Earth. 
He says the project is his opportunity to 
help repair the world.
It seems like a stretch — an opportu­
nity to help repair the world?
You can see some of the photos he’s 
taken so far online at NYChildren.org. 
The slideshow of photographs grabbed 
my attention. Some of the photographs 
have a journalistic feel to them. Others 
are portraits. All of images show a sim­
ple candidness in the children that cre­
ates a thread of unity among them.
What’s more compelling than the 
photographs, though, is Goldfield’s vi­
sion of the final product.
“My dream is that there would be 
an event in a museum, and that all 
the families who participated could be 
invited and could meet each other and 
celebrate,” Goldfield said in a GOOD 
magazine video documenting the proj­
ect. “The mission is to gather and nur­
ture an inclusive community of chil­
dren, create opportunities for them to 
meet, learn about each other, and form 
friendships.”
The ethos of the project draws on 
the classic liberal notion that as differ­
ent people experience each other on a 
substantial level, their differences will 
melt away, leaving the world a more 
peaceful and integrated place. It’s a 
notion my experience leads me to be­
lieve. And I believe that giving children 
the opportunity to interact with other 
children from different backgrounds 
is an invaluable gift, and one that few 
people get.
Two years ago, I spent part of the 
summer in a rural village in Tanzania 
called Kiomba Mvua — which trans­
lates to “praying for rain.” The youngest 
child in the village was about a year 
old. She and some of the other very 
young children had never seen a white 
person — visitors were rare and televi­
sion would have required electricity. I 
remember being taken aback when my 
eagerness to play was met by resound­
ing timidity. I didn’t get it at first. But 
I noticed that the kids, especially the 
infant, were far less comfortable with 
white volunteers than those with dark 
skin. It took days of goofy antics to con­
vince them that I was a safe friend.
But timidity and discomfort around 
the unfamiliar isn’t limited to children 
in remote villages in Africa; it is com­
mon to all of us. We constantly rely 
on our experience to figure out how 
to interact with the world around us. 
When we encounter something that 
falls outside of our experience set, we 
feel discomfort.
By that logic, giving children the 
chance to create positive experiences 
with other families from different back­
grounds primes them for a more com­
fortable interactions with people in the 
future.
The NYChildren project feels almost 
too idealistic to make an impact. But the 
simplicity of the very concrete objective 
of photographing one New York City 
child from each of the world’s countries 
brings it down to earth, and the images 
communicate the project’s potent mes­
sage to anyone who finds joy and hope 
in happy, healthy children.

CMU professor Ben Fischer passes away at 92
Ariane Simon/Layout Manager
Professor Ben Fischer
by Michelle Bova
Contributing Editor
Ben Fischer, distinguished 
public service professor of labor 
studies and public policy at the 
Heinz School of Public Policy 
and Management, died Sunday, 
November 12. He was 92.
Fischer’s death marked the end 
of a career in which he helped 
change the way the steel indus­
try treated its employees.
Before he joined the Carnegie 
Mellon faculty in 1981, Fischer 
worked for United Steelwork­
ers of America. There he served 
as the assistant to four union 
presidents and helped change 
the way minorities and women 
were treated by the major steel 
companies.
“There was a lot of racial 
and gender discrimination in 
the ’40s and ’50s,” said Bernie 
Kleiman, general counsel of 
the United Steelworkers, who 
worked with Fischer. “[Fischer] 
started working with this issue 
to break down these barriers in 
the late ’40s.”
By 1974, the Steel Industry 
Consent Decrees changed the 
system of seniority and led to 
greater mobility for those placed 
in disadvantageous positions in 
the industry.
Fischer was also well known 
for his contributions to the prac­
tice of collective bargaining and 
labor arbitrations.
In 1979, he retired from United 
Steelworkers after 37 years. 
Carnegie Mellon hired him 
in 1981, at which time he 
started the Center for Labor 
Studies and began applying his 
decades of knowledge to the 
classroom.
“To take a course from Ben 
would be a course in labor his­
tory that would also be a course 
that would challenge students 
to think and reexamine their 
politics and ethics,” said Fisch­
er’s colleague and friend Robert 
Strauss, a professor of economics 
and public policy.
After 10 years, the Center for 
Labor Studies closed due to a lack 
of funds and support from Carn­
egie Mellon. However, Fischer 
stayed on the faculty to teach 
courses on a variety of labor is­
sues, including social security, 
immigration, and retirement 
economics.
Fisher’s wife of 26 years, Sylvia 
Fischer, described her late hus­
band as a hands-on professor.
“He loved his. students truly, 
and we would have them here for 
breakfast, lunch, and dinner,” 
she said, adding that he referred 
to so many students as ‘brilliant’ 
that “we stopped listening to him 
after a while.”
Though Fischer was no longer 
teaching courses at the Heinz 
School, he taught an indepen­
dent study course this semester 
in public policy and manage­
ment for students who wanted to 
continue working with him. He 
also taught for the Academy for 
Lifelong Learning until four days
before his death.
Fischer was equally adept at 
relating to his students at the 
Academy for Lifelong Learning. 
His students ranged from senior 
citizens to college students who 
were 60 or 70 years his junior, 
said Daniel Naylor, a former un­
dergraduate student of Fischer’s 
and a 2002 Carnegie Mellon 
graduate.
“One of the common laments 
[in college] is that students can’t 
really connect to their teachers,” 
Naylor said. “Ben welcomed you 
into his family. He was someone 
you could really talk to and re­
late to.”
Colleagues also remember 
Fischer as a mentor outside the 
classroom.
Linda Babcock, an economics 
professor in the Heinz School, 
was hired in 1988, when Fischer 
taught at the school.
“He took me under his wing,” 
Babcock said. “[He] helped me 
get settled into the place.”
For Naylor, Fischer served as a 
mentor long after graduation.
“Four years later, I still had 
a great relationship with him,” 
Naylor said. “He was a stand- 
up person and a mentor to so 
many.”
Spiderman pays visit to boy with leukemia
SPIDERMAN, from A1
man your lunchbox?” Noah’s 
mother asked, pointing to one of 
many Spiderman toys and gear 
decorating Noah’s room. Noah 
has not been able to leave his 
hospital room for more than a 
month, except for major proce­
dures.
Spiderman acted shocked to 
see a photograph of himself on 
Noah’s lunchbox. “They took 
my photograph?” he said. “They 
never told me about that!”
“I have Spiderman crayons 
and markers too!” Noah said.
The ice was finally broken.
Noah excitedly showed Spider­
man his collection of Spiderman 
toys, asked Spiderman to show 
him where the spider had bit­
ten him, and made sure to point 
out all of the big scenes in the 
Spiderman movie, which was 
playing in the background dur­
ing the visit. Noah’s mother said 
that the movie is almost always 
playing.
“If he has a 102 fever and he’s 
carefree like this, you know he’s 
excited,” Noah’s mother said.
Noah and Spiderman were 
inseparable for nearly an hour
until it was time for Spiderman 
to leave.
Noah’s mom could not be 
more pleased with the scene. 
“He doesn’t get the opportunity 
to play with other kids because 
of the risk of infection. So this is 
huge for him.”
Noah’s aunt is grateful to ev­
eryone who helped out, includ­
ing Harding, MacKenzie-Wood, 
Elizabeth Bradley, Diane Col­
lins, and Jennifer Chapman, all 
of whom are in the School of 
Drama. Their generous efforts to 
benefit a complete stranger, she 
said, allowed a little boy’s dream
to come true.
“In just three days it was 
thrown together,” she said. “And 
it’s just perfect.”
Noah’s mother commended 
Harding on his excellent job as 
Spiderman, adding that Noah 
has no doubt that he met the real 
Spiderman.
“He told all the nurses ‘I saw 
Spiderman today! We hung out 
and he’s my friend,’” she said. 
“He doesn’t even question it.” 
Spiderman also enjoyed the 
afternoon with his new friend.
“It was a good feeling,” Hard­
ing said.

TUITION, from A1
“Strategic Initiatives at Carnegie 
Mellon.”
Currently, the market value 
of the university’s total endow­
ment is $941 million. Whereas 
the average endowment per stu­
dent among peer institutions is 
$444,628, Carnegie Mellon’s is 
less than $100,000. - 
Students and parents pres­
ent at the meeting argued that 
the university’s division into six 
individual colleges often makes 
for a fragmented student body. 
The separation, they said, would 
make alumni more interested in 
contributing to their individual 
colleges and less to the university 
as a whole, leading to a smaller 
endowment.
“Anything that pulls the entire 
university together is lacking,” 
said Emily Leathers, one of the 
students who attended the meet­
ing. The chair of Student Senate, 
Leathers is a senior in computer 
science and civil and environ­
mental engineering.
Elliott said such a pattern was 
to be expected because of the 
university’s structure.
“We segment our audience in 
the admissions process when we 
make them apply to one of the six 
colleges,” he said.
Attendees suggested imple-
menting more fundraising 
events, alumni activities, and 
school spirit to increase alumni 
contributions that would in­
crease the endowment.
The reason for Carnegie Mel­
lon’s comparatively small endow­
ment is that it is much younger 
than its peer institutions, Kamlet 
said.
He-said Carnegie Mellon can 
only evaluate its progress as 
a university comparable to its 
peers since 1967, when the Carn­
egie Institute of Technology and 
the Mellon Institute merged to 
become Carnegie Mellon Univer­
sity.
“Because we’re so young, we 
don’t have the length of time 
and family wealth that all of the 
other schools we compete with 
have,” Kamlet explained.
In the last 50 years, he pointed 
out, Carnegie Mellon has trans­
formed from a regional, tech­
nical school for the children of 
steel mill workers to one of the 
country’s leading research insti­
tutions with certain programs 
and departments consistently 
ranked in the top 10.
“We have come farther, faster 
than any of our peer institu­
tions,” Kamlet said.
Statistics show the university 
is making the best use of the 
endowment money that it'does
have. U.S. News & World Report 
ranked Carnegie Mellon first in 
endowment efficiency, a measure 
of the school’s performance in 
relation to the size of its endow­
ment. The university’s score was 
more than four times higher than 
that of older universities with 
larger endowments, including 
Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth.
Furthermore, the university’s 
endowment has grown 31 per­
cent over the last three years.
“The number of donors of the 
university is four-, five-, or six­
fold more than what it was four, 
five, or six years ago,” Elliott 
said.
Moon spoke at the meeting 
about Carnegie Mellon’s current 
financial pressures and listed 
endowment at the top of the 
university’s list of current finan­
cial challenges. The second was 
the continuing need to invest in 
updating the university’s techno­
logical infrastructure.
“We’re living in an environ­
ment that requires constant con­
nectivity,” Moon said.
Other financial needs included 
renovating labs and classrooms, 
restructuring the university’s 
debt, and cutting university 
health care costs to half the na­
tional average in order to offset 
the rising price of medical ben­
efits.
Moon spoke about the univer­
sity’s continuation of a capital 
campaign to meet its goals, no 
less than 50 percent of whose 
funds will be put towards the 
endowment, as well as an ad­
ditional 10 percent to facilities. 
She reported that phase I and 
early phase II results indicated 
that the university has actually 
surpassed its financial goals.
However, money received 
from private donors, a figure 
that includes endowment, ac­
counts for only 11 percent of this 
year’s operating revenue. Tuition 
and fees, on the other hand, ac­
count for 33 percent of that fig­
ure. Though administrators may 
be able to predict the growth of 
the endowment, they are more 
hesitant to predict the future of 
tuition.
. Elliott said the administration 
has not decided on the cost of tu­
ition for the 2007-08 academic 
year. He did say that the univer­
sity will continue to adjust the 
figure every year, as opposed to 
setting tuition and holding it for 
the duration of a student’s four 
years here.
“We can’t even figure out what 
the value of money would be six 
to 12 months from now,” he said. 
“We would end up overcharging 
freshmen and sophomores sig­
nificantly.”

LiNK distributed ribbons and buttons in the UC to promote its cause.
LiNK promotes activism 
on part of North Korea
LINK, from A1
Korea, the issue was never dis­
cussed in depth.
“In [elementary school], they 
just taught us that North Korea 
was a communist country that 
was different than ours, but 
that’s all,” Ko said.
As LiNK’s education chair, 
Song has divided the informa­
tion into three discussions as 
a part of LiNK’s general body 
meetings, which occur the first 
Monday of every month. The first 
discussion is to provide back­
ground information and history 
on the split of North and South 
Korea and on the current presi­
dent of North Korea, Kim Jong II, 
and his actions. The second aims 
to address human rights issues 
involving the treatment of North 
Koreans in concentration camps 
and gulags (labor camps), and 
once they escape as refugees. 
Finally, the third focuses on how 
America fits into the situation.
“There are a lot of rumors, but 
not actual facts going around, 
so it’s important that people are 
educated,” Song said. “The more 
they know, the more they’ll want 
to know.”
Jason Eisensmith, a senior at 
the University of Pittsburgh and 
the former LiNK coordinator for 
Pitt’s chapter, believes that the 
human rights issue is overshad­
owed by the political issue.
“When we ask people what
they know about North Korea, 
the very first thing they say is the 
nuclear weapon testing,” Eisen­
smith said.
Joe Kim, a senior ethics, his­
tory, and public policy major 
and the political chair of Carn­
egie Mellon’s LiNK, agrees.
“There shouldn’t just be a fo­
cus on nuclear weapons,” Kim 
said. “I wish people would see 
that it’? more than that.”
Ko said he was surprised how 
quickly the organization as a 
whole has spread in just two 
years. LiNK now has chapters 
in high schools, meaning some 
first-years come into college fa­
miliar with the organization.
Ko believes the next step is 
to promote tangible progress 
and resolution. His goal is to 
raise $2000 for Safe Haven, a 
donation large enough to sus­
tain a shelter for North Korean 
refugees in China for up to six 
months.
“We provide a direct means for 
people to help out,” Kim said.
Ko, Eisensmith, and Kim all 
agree that being a part of this 
organization and its cause is 
something they felt they needed 
to do.
“I feel a personal connection 
to these people in North Korea. 
They are in my genetic pool,” 
Kim said. “If anybody should be 
helping, it should be us.”

Speaker policy reviewed
SPEECH, from A1
posal upholds the ideals of the 
current policy on controversial 
speakers.
“The intent was never neces­
sarily to revise the policy,” he 
said. “The intent was to review 
the policy. To ask questions like, 
‘Does it still apply?’ [and] ‘Do 
the words still have the same 
meaning that they did in the ’60s 
when it was first put together?’ ”
At Carnegie Mellon, adminis­
trators routinely review policies 
every five years, though the high 
volume of policies often delays 
the process. Prior to the commit­
tee, definitely the controversial 
speakers policy had not been re­
viewed since its creation in the 
1960s.
According to Brown, the 
committee hopes the new policy 
will be approved by the end of 
the semester. “The reason it’s 
coming back after a year of be­
ing on the president’s desk is be­
cause, for it to become the new 
policy, it has to be approved by 
the Faculty Senate, the Student 
Senate, the [Graduate Student 
Assembly], and the Staff Coun­
cil,” he said.
The Faculty Senate and Staff 
Council have already voted 
in favor of the proposal, and 
the remaining constituencies 
will decide in meetings-follow­
ing Thanksgiving break. After 
that, the policy will go before 
the President’s Council and the 
Dean’s Council.
The committee was formed in 
August 2005, months after three 
visiting speakers caused stu­
dents and faculty to question the 
current policy. One such speaker 
was Malik Zulu Shabazz, chair­
man of the New Black Panther 
Party, whose racially charged 
points of discussion made stu­
dents uncomfortable. Also that
semester, the University Lecture 
Series invited Ali Abunimah and 
Norman Finkelstein to address 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
and both argued radical, anti- 
Israel perspectives.
“A lot of people were afraid 
that the committee would be in 
response to that,” said Nicolette 
Louissaint, a 2006 graduate in 
chemical engineering. Louis­
saint served on the committee 
from its creation last August to 
its finalized proposal last De­
cember. Students were worried 
that the spring speakers would 
inspire a stricter policy, Louis- 
sant explained.
Composed of students, faculty 
members, staff, administrators, 
and an alumnus, the commit­
tee was responsible for gather­
ing the ideas and feelings of the 
campus community. Members 
harvested input from e-mail 
feedback, open forum sessions, 
town hall meetings, and meet­
ings with more than 20 student 
and faculty organizations. The 
committee also considered the 
policies at other universities and 
colleges.
One such college, Jesuit insti­
tution Boston College, added a 
policy last month that tightened 
the reins on its students’ right to 
listen. According to The Harvard 
Crimson, student organizations 
are now required to supply an 
accompanying “Catholic per­
spective” to the presentations 
of controversial speakers. Abor­
tion is the most guarded-against 
subject of discussion, said Jack 
Dunn, spokesman for Boston 
College.
“We probably have the most 
open of the policies with the 
exception of a couple of other 
schools.” “Where else but in the 
university should you have a fo­
rum where people can come and 
speak their mind?”

When it comes to genetics, looks can 
be deceiving. On the surface, sea ur­
chins appear to share little in common 
with humans, but on the inside, these 
organisms could provide insight into 
the beginnings of human growth.
In fact, thanks to Carnegie Mellon bi­
ology professor Charles Ettensohn, you 
may never look at sea urchins the same 
way again.
Ettensohn worked alongside 200 re1 
searchers worldwide to discover the 
genome of the California purple sea 
urchin. He provided researchers with
51,000 complementary DNAs (cDNAs), 
or about one-third of the genomic in­
formation necessary to sequence the 
genome.
cDNA is so called because its se­
quence of bases is the complement of 
a given DNA sequence. By finding the 
DNA sequence’s com­
plement, scien­
tists can find the sequence of the actual 
DNA. In that sense, scientists can work 
backwards to figure out entire DNA se­
quences.
Sea urchins are relatives of chordates, 
the phyluin to which humans belong, 
making sea urchins useful for studying 
the embryonic development of humans.
The Sea Urchin Genome Sequenc­
ing Consortium is a team of research­
ers based out of the Human Genome 
Sequencing Center at Baylor College in 
Houston, Texas. The center was respon­
sible for sequencing the genome.
The sea urchin genome is very long, 
said Ettensohn, but most of the genome 
remains unexpressed because it is inac­
tive. In contrast, cDNAs are parts of an 
organism’s genome that are expressed.
“The cDNAs let you get an idea of 
what part of the genome is active,” he 
said.
Ettensohn’s lab used cDNAs to verify 
computer predictions of gene locations 
along the sea urchin genome. In par­
ticular, computers looked for sequences 
within the sea urchin genome that were 
similar to sequences in 
other organisms.
Ettensohn said 
that sea urchins 
have been used 
for over a cen­
tury and a half 
as a model 
system for 
studying 
embry­
onic development, partly because of 
their external fertilization system.
“The fact that [fertilization] happens 
outside the mother means that you can 
study the process very easily,” he said.
The embryos are also easy to see, 
“like glass,” said Ettensohn.
Ettensohn’s lab sequenced the part 
of the sea urchin genome responsible 
for building the sea urchin’s skeleton. 
Ettensohn is studying the influence of 
individual genes on embryonic develop­
ment by turning certain genes on and 
off.
“The goal is basically to understand 
how genes control development,” said 
Ettensohn.
But researchers had to begin small 
before looking at individual genes.
The entire genome contains around
23,000 genes. Researchers began their 
study by breaking the genome into 
pieces, using computers to search for 
patterns and overlaps in the genetic 
material.
These patterns allowed researchers 
to assemble the gene.
Greg Wray, a professor of biology at 
Duke University, said, “The first part is 
really a jigsaw puzzle issue.”
After the individual parts of the ge­
nome are strung together, the genome 
is annotated, or interpreted, based on 
comparisons with other organisms.
If researchers know the function of 
similar genes in other organisms, then 
they can deduce the function of sea 
urchin genes.
“We’re trying to find features that 
mean something in what is otherwise 
just alphabetical soup,” Wray said.
Researchers are now trying to dis­
cover genetic similarities among sea 
urchins and humans that could account 
for embryonic development.
. By modifying a sea urchin gene, re­
searchers can learn more about the 
regulatory process and proteins that 
underlie early growth.
Wray said that this is his favorite stage 
of the project.
“Everything up to then is operational
— you have to do it to get to the fun 
part.”
Also, the use of sea urchins is cheap. 
Whereas a mouse experiment costs 
around $20,000, said Wray, a sea urchin 
experiment costs only $100.
The downside of using sea urchins, 
however, is that, in evolutionary terms, 
they are further from humans than 
mice.
Wray said that while sea urchins are a 
starting point for understanding human 
genes, mice allow for more detailed 
analysis.
“You can think of it as a screening 
process,” he said.
Andrew Cameron, a senior research 
associate at the California Institute of 
Technology, also provided research­
ers with collections of cDNA. The 
collections were taken from ex­
pressed RNAs in the sea urchin. £jjj&
According to Cameron, ap­
pearances can be deceiving.
“Here we have an animal that looks 
very different than us, yet it has a much 
more similar genome to us then a fly or 
a worm does.”
Now that the genome has been se­
quenced, Cameron said, researchers 
will be able to study genes more effi­
ciently. In particular, researchers can 
now focus on identifying specific re­
gions within the genome.
For instance, the sea urchin genome 
contains regulatory regions that control 
gene expression. Researchers can dis­
cover these regions by comparing the 
sea urchin genomes to similar species.
“People can find ways to study genes 
many ways at once,” Cameron said.
The genomic sequence can be viewed 
on the Human Genome Sequencing 
Center Sea Urchin website at www.

Carnegie Mellon scientist helps to crack purple sea urchin genome
National Institutes of Health awards $8.5 million for biomed research

“There was a project with some neurologists 
in UCLA With a puzzling patient,” Stiles said. Al­
though researchers were able to identify the dis­
ease in question for this patient, they were unable 
to account for the side effects of a mutation in his 
genome.
They sent their data to the PSC in hopes of dis­
covering the cause of the anomaly.
“We used the modeling to predict a novel de­
fect ... and then experimental people were able 
to verify the functional impact of this mutation,” 
Stiles said.
Currently, the PSC invests time into expanding 
its educational outreach. The center has hired 
new personnel and has set aside some of the 
grant for training researchers on how to better 
use their modeling tools.
Their recent push has been to offer simplified 
training and educational programs to make their 
technologies accessible to students at the high 
school and even middle school level.
In the coming years, researchers at the PSC 
hope to see tighter integration among their vari­
ous systems.
“It’s already starting to happen. In our five- 
year plan, we hope to see direct coupling be­
tween volumetric data and cell modeling,” Stiles 
said.
Soon afterwards, they hope to integrate the 
third part of the PSC’s research, structural bio­
informatics, in order to provide “truly predictive 
simulations” of complex biological processes, 
and one day possibly even model a full human 
being.
“[Human modeling] is part of the big picture, 
targeting what we call ‘personalized medicine,”’ 
Stiles said.
This technology would allow people to upload 
their genomes, run a simulation of themselves, 
“[and] know at any time what proteins, and what 
amount of those proteins, are circulating in the 
bloodstream to fingerprint the current state of 
health,” Stiles said.
This technology, however, is still several de­
cades away. For now, research will focus on ac­
curately modeling processes at the cellular and 
tissue level. “A realistic model of a cell is a tall 
order,” Stiles said. “Let’s start there.”

The PSC Volume Browser allows users to view 3-D 
images of cells, like human tissue, over the Internet.
The National Institutes of Health recently 
awarded the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Cen­
ter (PSC) an $8.5 million grant for biomedical 
research. The grant extends support of the Na­
tional Resource for Biomedical Supercomputing 
(NRBSC) for an additional five years.
For the last 20 years, the NRBSC has con­
tributed to the field of biomedical research 
through simulation work on supercomputing 
networks. According to the group’s website, the 
NRBSC “pursues leading-edge research in high- 
performance computing and the life sciences.”
PSC scientific co-director Ralph Roskies 
stated in a press release that “for 20 years, the 
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center has provided 
national leadership in applying advanced com­
putational resources to biomedical research.”
And their computational resources are vast. 
Currently, internal projects make up three main 
areas: volumetric data browsing, realistic cell 
modeling, and structural biology.
The browsing program acts almost like a cel­
lular encyclopedia.
“The way the volume browser works is that 
data is stored via a large multiprocessor server 
and many [client programs] can be attached to 
it at the same time,” said Joel Stiles, director of 
the PSC.
The browser program is small enough to run 
on a desktop machine and is publicly available 
for download. With it, one can quickly and eas­
ily view cross-sections of tissue samples, move 
through these samples, or play back recordings 
made of these samples in real-time.
Doctors could also find ways to use the ap­
plication, such as by comparing the abnormal 
heartbeats of patients to a 3-D model of a normal 
heartbeat, potentially expediting a diagnosis.
The continuously improving simulations also 
have far-reaching results, both for biology and 
for individual patients. This is also the case with 
cell modeling, which can accurately study the 
way cells move in relation to one another and 
present a 3-D image of the cells in motion.

Dark chocolate 
lowers clot risks
Researchers at Johns Hopkins 
University have found that dark 
chocolate may help reduce risks 
of forming blood clots. They 
claim a bit of dark chocolate 
each day thins the blood, similar 
to the way aspirin works.
When conducting the study, 
the researchers compared blood 
platelet clotting formation be­
tween chocoholics and . those 
who did not eat chocolate for an 
extended period of time.
The chocoholics’ platelets av­
eraged 130 seconds to form a 
dot, while the non-chocoholics 
averaged 123 seconds for clot 
formation.

Migraines linked to 
greater heart risk
A recent study of middle-aged 
men who suffered migraine 
headaches found them to be 42 
percent more likely to have a 
heart attack than nonsufferers.
Experts .from the American 
Heart Association believe the re­
lationship has to do with blood 
vessels in the head. A migraine 
constricts the blood vessels, 
causing the headache sensa­
tion. As a side effect, blood flow 
— and thus oxygen supply to 
the heart — is limited, possibly 
causing a heart attack.

Heart repairs itself
Scientists at University Col­
lege London observed that cells 
in the heart’s outermost layer 
can repair failing organs.
Using a protein called thymo­
sin B4, the scientists stimulated 
mice hearts to grow new blood 
vessels from heart progenitor 
cells, the cells present on the 
outermost layer of the heart.
The research team thinks that 
if the cells could be precisely 
directed with the protein, re­
generation therapy would be 
possible in the near future. The 
breakthrough could simplify 
surgical procedures concerning 
the heart.

Positive emotions could mean less illness
by Shawn Wertz
Scienct & Technology Editor
Seeing a glass of water as half- 
empty or half-full has become 
somewhat of a cliched piece of 
folklore today.
Regardless of how much of it 
you drink each day, the way you 
look at a glass of water could say 
a lot about how healthy you are, 
or will be later on in life.
But even with the lack of a 
“correct” answer, the science 
behind positive thinking is be­
ginning to show that there may 
be a “healthy” answer to the 
drinking-glass test.
Happy people can live health­
ier lives than their moody coun­
terparts. Happiness, or positive 
emotion, can actually “medicate” 
people against certain ailments. 
But aside from depression medi­
cation — which is obviously in­
tended for use only by those who 
truly need it — there are no real 
“happy pills” being marketed by 
pharmaceutical companies.
Instead, research has shown 
that positive emotion, inherent 
in some individuals, could actu­
ally be providing a pick-me-up 
when it comes to making people 
feel better.
The idea that positive emotion 
can have a positive impact is not 
a new idea. In a 1998 article in 
APA Monitor, then American 
Psychological Association Presi­
dent Martin Seligman stated, 
“Psychology should turn toward
understanding and building the 
human strengths to complement 
our emphasis on healing dam­
age.”
Seligman’s solution was to 
start a class on positive psychol­
ogy, the study of the virtues that 
allow individuals and communi­
ties to thrive.
In his class, Seligman ob­
served how positive actions af­
fect people’s emotions.
“We were to do one pleasurable 
activity and one philanthropic ac­
tivity,” he
The study was done in collabo­
ration with researchers at the 
University of Pittsburgh School 
of Medicine, the University of 
Rochester School of Medicine and 
Dentistry, and the University of 
Virginia Health Sciences Center.
Participants in the study were 
first monitored on the phone 
over several weeks to assess their 
moods and emotional styles. 
They were then placed in a hotel 
and were given nose drops that 
contained the influenza virus.
The research-
stated.
“When the 
philanthropic 
act was spon­
taneous and called 
upon skill, the rest of the 
day went better.”
But a recent study conducted 
by Carnegie Mellon psychology 
professor Sheldon Cohen shows 
that good acts aren’t only good 
for your emotional health, they 
benefit you physically as well.
The study, recently published 
in Psychosomatic Medicine, backs 
up Cohen’s claims in a 2004 paper 
that people who exhibit positive 
emotions are less likely to get sick 
when exposed to a virus than peo­
ple who did not appear happy.

ers quarantined and moni­
tored the participants for a week 
to see if they showed signs of a 
common cold. The result of the 
study showed that those people 
who exhibited positive emotional 
styles were less susceptible to 
catching a cold.
Though Cohen was unavail­
able for comment, he stated in a 
press release, “We need to take 
more seriously the possibility that 
positive emotional style is a major 
player in disease risk.”
The study shows that the old
cliched saying “Don’t worry, be 
happy” could have some merit. 
Those who live a pleasant life 
could find themselves rewarded 
with good health.
“Dr. Cohen’s work has shown 
that individuals who have higher 
positive emotionality are less 
likely to develop a cold when 
they are exposed to a virus,” re­
searcher Sarah Pressman said.
Pressman received her Ph.D. 
in psychology after working with 
Cohen in the Laboratory for the 
Study of Stress, Immunity, and 
Disease. Part of Pressman’s re­
search was to see how positive 
emotions affect health.
“This included a wide array of 
health outcomes such as longev­
ity, your probability of getting a 
disease, and even how long you 
survive a disease once you have 
it,” Pressman said.
Survival rate could be signifi­
cantly affected by mood. In pre­
vious research, Pressman found 
that people who write more posi­
tive words in their autobiogra­
phies live about six years longer 
than those who do not use posi­
tive words.
Positive emotions can also af­
fect susceptibility and response 
to major medical conditions like 
having a stroke and recovering 
from heart surgery.
Though not as serious as a heart 
condition, perhaps some will also 
keep in mind that, with the onset 
of cold weather, a positive mind 
could mean clear sinuses or a 
sniffle-free holiday season.

Declining temperatures and 
shorter days mean that flu season 
is approaching.
According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 
between 5 and 20 percent of 
Americans get the flu each year. 
More than 200,000 of these indi­
viduals are hospitalized for their 
illness.
The flu is a respiratory dis­
ease caused by the influenza vi­
rus. This virus is usually spread, 
through the sinuses by sneezing, 
coughing, or kissing. It can also 
be passed along by touching an 
infected surface and transfer­
ring the virus through the eyes
or nose.
Common flu symptoms include 
headache, sore throat, fever, and 
tiredness. Children can also ex­
perience nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea.
The influenza virus can lead 
to more serious complications, 
such as sinus infection, dehydra­
tion, and bacterial pneumonia. 
Around 20,000 Americans die 
each year from flu complications. 
People with asthma or cystic fi­
brosis are especially susceptible 
to complications due to their 
weakened respiratory systems.
Because flu symptoms usually 
appear after infection, a person 
can spread the illness without 
knowing that it is present. In 
fact, it can take up to 24 hours for 
a person who has contracted the
flu virus to display symptoms. 
Once the disease has been con­
tracted, it is contagious for up to 
seven days.
The best way to avoid getting 
the flu is to receive a flu shot each 
year. The flu shot is an inactive 
vaccine that can be given to in­
dividuals six months and older. 
It takes about two weeks for the 
vaccine to provide protection 
against the influenza virus.
Flu vaccine also comes in the 
form of nasal spray, which con­
tains live influenza viruses that 
are not strong enough to cause 
illness. This vaccination is only 
meant for healthy individuals 
who are over the age of five.
Because the nasal spray con­
tains live influenza viruses, pa­
tients may experience flu symp­
toms, such as fever and muscle 
aches.
If you get the flu, try to get 
plenty of rest and drink fluids 
that contain electrolytes. Elec­
trolytes are ions that help main­
tain your body’s water levels. 
Fruit juices, chicken soup, and 
sports drinks are good sources of 
electrolytes.
Flu season typically begins 
in early winter and can end as 
late as early spring, peaking in 
January. During winter, indoor 
humidity is low compared to out­
door humidity, allowing the flu 
virus to survive longer indoors.
As with other contagious dis­
eases, the flu is less likely to 
spread if people stay away from 
ill individuals and wash their 
hands frequently.
How Things Work: Quicksand
Sarah Mogin
“Beware of the ground for which you 
stand, the floor is quicker than the sand.”
Making appearances in Jumanji, The 
Mummy, and The Princess Bride, quick­
sand is no stranger to the silver screen. 
In real life, however, this natural hazard 
is not the stuff of Hollywood. Quicksand 
is slow, usually shallow, and rarely fatal. 
Dry quicksand—a distant, sinister cousin 
— makes for a more interesting story.
Though an unfortunate roll left Juman- 
jVs Judy and Peter scrambling for solid 
ground, quicksand’s natural formation is 
slightly less theatrical. It is often associ­
ated with swampy or tropical climates, 
but a relatively simple set of circum­
stances can turn sand into quicksand in 
almost all environments.
Water rising from an underground 
source can disrupt an otherwise steady 
region of sand. Often this process oc­
curs unprovoked, though sometimes it 
is caused when earthquakes aggravate 
subsurface waters. Common hotspots for 
quicksand include seashores, riverbanks, 
locations near springs, and marshes.
Under normal conditions, the fric­
tional forces between individual grains 
of sand combine to form a force chain, 
which is what enables sandy surfaces 
such as beaches and deserts to hold large 
amounts of weight.
When enough water enters the system, 
this friction is disrupted and the grains 
of sand enter a state of suspension that 
is far less stable. Though weak below 
the surface, the sand’s uppermost layer 
almost always maintains a deceptively 
dry appearance, making it possible for an 
unsuspecting traveler to stumble into a
region of quicksand.
Even without a copy of The Worst-Case 
Scenario Survival Handbook in tote, a 
victim of quicksand is seldom in any real 
danger. That being said, extricating one­
self from such a watery pit is still some­
thing.of a production.
Quicksand takes hold of a sunken body 
the same way thick mud can suction a 
boot on a rainy day. Motion only strength­
ens its grasp, creating a vacuum pressure. 
Thus, the most effective way to escape 
the clutch of quicksand is to make slow
Jennifer Kennedy/Art Staff
and subtle movements.
Even if it’s only a few feet deep, being 
stranded in quicksand can result in other 
perils. The struggle out can lead to heat 
exhaustion. Moreover, victims of quick­
sand are vulnerable to environmental 
hazards such as a rising tide or predatory 
animals.
Deeper pits of quicksand, though 
more dangerous, are still far from life- 
threatening. Humans are able to float in 
water, which has a density of one gram 
per cubic centimeter, one-half that of
quicksand. Thus, buoyant force would 
prevent any unlucky traveler from sink­
ing beneath the surface.
Since motion increases suction, the 
best course of action is to remain still and 
lie back. It would be nearly impossible to 
drown in a pit of quicksand, unless a vic­
tim was to enter one headfirst.
Unlike quicksand, dry quicksand lives 
up to its name. Similar to a house of 
cards, dry quicksand under pressure will 
collapse instantaneously.
When air flows through a body of sand, 
the grains loosen, creating a system of 
dry quicksand unable to support even 
small amounts of weight.
Dry quicksand has only ever been doc­
umented in a lab setting, though there is 
no scientific reason that it could not ex­
ist in nature; desert winds would achieve 
the same effect as the air currents used by 
scientists to manufacture dry quicksand. 
If it does exist, dry quicksand would ex­
plain the various legends of desert travel­
ers and even entire caravans disappear­
ing beneath the sand.
Such a possibility was taken so seri­
ously that the legs of the Apollo missions’ 
Lunar Module were equipped with large 
plates to protect against a descent into 
unsteady soil. As it happened, the addi­
tion was not needed; the surface of the 
moon turned out to be solid.
In labs, when objects such as ping-pong 
balls are released onto dry quicksand, 
the energy associated with the collapse 
causes a stream of sand to shoot into the 
air. Though dry quicksand didn’t make 
it into Jumanji, a vanishing caravan of 
travelers immediately followed by a jet­
tison of sand would certainly be worthy 
of Hollywood.

Longest golf swing 
to be achieved
Russian cosmonaut Mikhail 
Tyurin will probably break the 
current record for longest golf 
drive — by thousands of miles. 
The attempt will take place on 
the International Space Station 
Wednesday as part of a promo­
tional stunt for Element 21 Golf, 
the Canadian company that 
makes the golf club being used.
Tyurin will not be able to hit 
the ball like conventional golf­
ers on Earth. His suit makes it 
impossible to hold a golf club 
with two hands. Instead, Tyurin 
will swing at the ball with one 
hand. The ball will be held in a 
wire mesh basket, instead of a 
conventional tee.
Tyurin will have to wedge his 
foot between brackets on the 
space station to avoid flying off 
in accordance with Newton’s 
First Law of Motion, under 
which he would continue to stay 
in motion with the swing.

‘Carbon tax’ given 
okay in Colorado
Voters in Boulder, Colo, ap­
proved a tax designed to cut 
down on carbon emissions of 
greenhouse gases.
The decision came last Tues­
day and will take effect on April 
1 of next year. The tax is based 
on the number of kilowatt-hours 
used by households. The town 
anticipates that the new tax 
could mean an extra $16 each 
month coming from the average 
homeowner in addition to $46 
from local businesses.
Residents of Boulder who use 
alternative energy sources such 
as wind power will receive a tax 
break based on the amount of 
alternative energy used.
A similar decision was made 
five years ago in Oregon.

Report finds that 
animals in danger
A report issued by the United 
Nations Environment Program 
suggests that migratory animals 
could be in danger of extinction 
due to rising temperatures.
Migratory species cover vast 
areas, and as a result depend 
on muliple ecosystems for their 
survival. Turtles, for example, 
cover large portions of ocean 
waters. Birds are also in danger, 
covering large areas from conti­
nent to continent.
The report found that turtles 
are particularly affected by ris­
ing temperatures, primarily in 
their reproductive patterns. The 
change in temperature shows 
a change in the ratio of males 
to females. At higher tempera­
tures, some turtles produce a 
greater amount of female eggs 
than male eggs.
Other species were singled 
out as well, including the North 
Atlantic right whale, the white- 
beaked dolphin, and the Baikal 
teal.

In the race for highest tuition, students lose
The rising cost of tuition is a peren­
nial complaint of college students na­
tionwide. This week, the issue came to 
the forefront at Carnegie Mellon as the 
administration hosted its annual tuition 
discussion dinner on Tuesday night.
Indeed, examination of the numbers 
shows a disturbing picture. It is com­
mon knowledge that college tuition has 
consistently outpaced the U.S. rate of 
inflation. In 1986, an incoming Carn­
egie Mellon first-year paid a tuition of 
$10,250. According to the U.S. Bureau 
of Labor Statistics online inflation calcu­
lator, this is equivalent in buying power 
to $18,873 today, an increase of 84 
percent. Yet this year’s incoming class 
is footing a bill of $34,180, a cost 233 
percent higher than their counterparts 
faced two decades ago. At this rate, a 
member of the Carnegie Mellon class of 
2030 will have to come up with just un­
der $114,000. Per year. That amounts to 
about $61,957 in today’s dollars.
Carnegie Mellon’s cost has even been 
increasing faster than that of peer in­
stitutions. In the 1996 Carnegie Mellon 
Factbook, the university’s tuition placed 
ninth out of 11 schools in its peer group. 
Last year’s Factbook showed our tuition 
as the fifth-highest in a group of 14, and 
information presented at the tuition 
dinner Tuesday placed Carnegie Mel­
lon’s tuition ahead of all 13 other peer 
institutions.
It’s not so lonely at the top, however.
Last year, the six most expensive univer­
sities in our peer group reported tuitions 
within $600 of each other; Tuesday’s in­
formation showed the top six within a 
$1000 price range this year as well.
That fact hints at a situation that is 
even more disturbing than the raw num­
bers themselves. It seems universities 
are setting tuition rates in a nationwide 
rat race, with each one justifying the in­
crease as necessary in order to remain 
competitive with all the others.
Part of Tuesday’s presentations were 
devoted to analyzing how Carnegie Mel­
lon fared in this year’s U. S. News & World 
Report rankings of the nation’s best col­
leges before tuition matters were even 
brought up. Other institutions are mak­
ing similar connections between cost 
and rank.
“If we’re just trying to survive, and go 
on as we’ve been going on before, then 
the tuition increase wouldn’t be as high,” 
said John Anderson, the provost of Case 
Western Reserve University, in a 2005 
interview. “But if you stay constant, Case 
will drop in rankings because everyone 
else is investing.”
Tuition increases at Cornell Univer­
sity are also partly driven by competi­
tion, according to the university’s daily 
news service. “Cornell offers a premium 
product ... in an extremely competi­
tive market,” an article stated earlier 
this month, “and to stay ahead of the 
pack, the university must keep getting
the best students, faculty and facilities
— and the best rankings. And that costs 
a lot of money.”
If tuition is used as another player 
in the incessant game of jockeying for 
rankings and competing for students 
that universities nationwide play, stu­
dents all over the country lose. Tuition 
is a major factor in college decisions for 
many students, yet it is one they have 
extremely little influence over. While 
prospective students, strictly speaking, 
are not forced to attend a school they 
find too expensive, rampant cost-of-at- 
tendance increases risk pricing return­
ing students out of their universities and 
giving them more reasons to feel aban­
doned by the administration.
The current rate of tuition increase 
is unsustainable; university officials 
everywhere should drop the “keeping 
up with the Joneses” approach now. 
As a top-tier university dedicated to 
researching tough issues and solving 
problems, Carnegie Mellon cannot just 
throw its hands up in the air and say 
the matter is out of its control. President 
Cohon and the Board of Trustees (who 
make the final decision) should honor 
Carnegie Mellon’s tradition of innova­
tive problem solving to tackle the prob­
lem head on. Andrew Carnegie created 
a university for the sons and daughters 
of Pittsburgh’s working-class families. 
We would hate to see that tradition 
jeopardized.
Pa. committee finds academic bias rare
In light of recent findings about po­
litical bias in academia, we are seriously 
questioning conservative activist David 
Horowitz’s grip on reality.
. This past week, a bipartisan commit­
tee formed by the Pennsylvania House 
of Representatives concluded that there 
is no need to implement Horowitz’s so- 
called Academic Bill of Rights. The As­
sociated Press reported that the com­
mittee determined political bias is rare 
in the Commonwealth’s public colleges.
While the committee is expected to 
recommend that colleges review their 
own policies and procedures related to 
students’ academic freedom, it seems 
like a knock-down blow to Horowitz’s 
cause.
Somehow, though, Horowitz found a 
way to twist the news. His most recent 
article — published in his own online 
magazine — is titled “Pennsylvania 
Committee Finds Students Have No 
Rights.” The article directly contradicts
the Associated Press report and attempts 
to portray the committee’s findings as a 
victory for his partisan scheme.
Not only does Horowitz grossly mis­
represent the committee’s actual find­
ings, but in the bylined article Horowitz 
actually quotes himself: “David Horow­
itz, author of the Academic Bill of Rights 
and sponsor of a nationwide campaign 
for academic freedom, hailed the report 
as a ‘major victory in the battle for stu­
dent rights.’”
Maybe Horowitz has written one too 
many double-speak press releases.
Horowitz, who was once a Marxist 
activist, now runs the online conser­
vative magazine FrontPageMag.com
— which routinely commits copyright 
infringement, reprinting articles (in­
cluding some from The Tartan) without 
permission.
Horowitz has spent years lobbying 
state legislatures to enact laws that in­
corporate elements of his Academic Bill
of Rights. The legislation would require 
professors to create syllabi that “reflect 
the uncertainty and unsettled charac­
ter of all human knowledge.” In other 
words, professors could be taken to 
court for failing to include sources on 
their reading list that they feel have no 
academic value. His Bill of Rights uses 
the rhetoric of equality and justice to 
veil his attempt to constrain professors’ 
freedom and intellectualism.
Regardless of how Horowitz spins the 
committee’s findings, the Pennsylvania 
legislature came through with a sound 
decision. Universities should be open 
to review their policies on academic 
freedom if members of their respective 
communities deem it necessary. They 
should communicate clearly with stu­
dents about their rights and options for 
recourse. But under no circumstances 
should state or federal government risk 
curtailing academic freedom in Ameri­
ca’s institutions of higher learning.
Charitable conservatives 
and dictatorial Democrats
Benjamin Hackett
The stereotypical perspective on the 
Democratic Party states that the Demo­
crats are the party of the little person. 
Conversely, Republicans are painted as. 
rich, bigoted, and intolerant. Neither of 
these stereotypes holds any water when 
analyzed. The myth of the charitable 
liberal seemingly knows no bounds. 
And I agree that liberals are infinitely 
more charitable — with other people’s 
money. However, when it comes to 
their own money, a recent study reveals 
where the true charity resides.
The misconception that liberalism is 
for the common man has been ingrained 
into the popular American political my­
thology. Liberal Democrats purchased 
this stereotype with taxpayer (read: 
your) money. Today, however, these 
sloppy entitlements threaten our na­
tion’s economy, which is arguably the 
strongest in American history.
Social Security and Medicare will 
burst the United States’ budget in the 
next 50 years without proper reform. 
The Medicare prescription drug plan 
that was thrust on seniors, many of 
whom do not benefit from it or do not 
want it, promises to cause similar bud­
getary woes. Welfare has long kept peo­
ple in poverty instead of giving them 
the means to raise their socioeconomic 
status. Yet, Democrats continue to ben­
efit from the lie of helping the little guy,
a large bloc of its voting base. How­
ever, today’s myth-debunking is slightly 
more narrow: the idea of liberals’ su­
perior generosity. One can understand 
why this myth is so persistent. Every 
day, Americans are deluged with im­
ages of celebrity giving, or Ted Turner 
dumping some of his vast fortune into 
the corrupt, but oh-so-well-intentioned, 
United Nations. It is practically impos­
sible to find a story about conservative 
charitable giving between the daily 
Bono, Madonna, and Angelina Jolie 
lovefests.
A recent study by Syracuse University 
professor Arthur C. Brooks outlines the 
truth behind the conservative generos­
ity. Professor Brooks’ book, Who Really 
Cares: The Surprising Truth About Com­
passionate Conservatism, comes out on 
Friday. In the book, Brooks details how 
traditional conservatives are the most 
generous Americans, giving far more to 
charity than their more secular liberal 
counterparts.
Traditional conservatives are defined 
in Brooks’ book as those who practice 
some form of religion, believe in smaller 
government with fewer or no entitle­
ments, and have a more traditional 
family makeup. The liberal group ana­
lyzed consists of, on average, liberals 
with more secular religious beliefs and 
who are huge fans of government en­
titlement programs as outlined above. 
Brooks’ analysis reveals that these con­
servative Americans donate more than 
their liberal counterparts, while men­
tioning it less. It seems that another
Brooks’ analysis reveals that... conservative 
Americans donate more than their liberal 
counterparts, while mentioning it less. It seems 
that ... liberals are great at giving others’ 
money away, while conservatives prefer to 
give charitably on their own accord and in 
greater sums comparatively.
when it is primarily their own political 
fortunes that benefit.
Even the most basic long-term policy 
analyses of entitlement-type programs 
point to methods of reform, or replace­
ment, that improve their recipients’ 
long-term real welfare. Today’s history 
lesson concerns another conservative 
fix to a sloppy governmental entitle­
ment policy. The conservative refor­
mation of welfare to “workfare” took 
citizens off the public payrolls and gave 
them a stake in their own lives. When 
the Gingrich Congress took Capitol Hill, 
welfare reform was a major component 
in the Contract for America.
Welfare reform was enacted in 1996 
and subsequently had a profound ef­
fect on unemployment and a serious 
lessening of the number of people on 
the welfare payrolls. In 1995, 5.2 per­
cent of U.S. citizens were on the wel­
fare rolls. After the start of welfare re­
form that number went down annually, 
dropping to a nearly all-time low of 2.1 
percent in 2000. People are better off 
when they have ownership of their own 
lives. While oft demonized as hating 
the poor, the conservative reforms had 
a net positive benefit for the impover­
ished. A reduction in the percentage of 
welfare recipients is a clear indicator of 
this benefit.
Above I have outlined the regressive 
nature, and the eventual need for re­
form, of an entitlement policy the left 
uses to maintain co-dependence with
read on Brooks’ analysis is that liber­
als are great at giving others’ money 
away, while conservatives prefer to give 
charitably of their own accord and in 
comparatively greater sums.
There is more to this analysis than 
just the raw numbers. A correct read 
on this startling revelation is that the 
liberal philosophy is more intrusive 
towards the individual and individual 
rights. When given the option to give 
on their own or allow government to 
dictate how others should give, the lib­
eral philosophy on giving chooses to in­
fringe on the choices of the individual in 
favor of big government.
As well-intentioned as a belief in gov­
ernment entitlement programs might 
be, liberals lose the moral high ground 
when they fail to act in the same man­
ner in which they demand others act. 
This is another case of the vast liberal 
hypocrisy that is exposed when any of 
the great political myths that pervade 
this nation are examined.
In his book, Brooks states, “For too 
long, liberals have been claiming they 
are the most virtuous members of Amer­
ican society. Although they usually give 
less to charity, they have nevertheless 
lambasted conservatives for their cal­
lousness in the face of social injustice.”

The unifying 
origins of the 
U.S.’ holiday
nup
_________________Marshall Roy
The prototype for Thanksgiving 
really did take place in 1621 be­
tween the Pilgrims and Native 
Americans. The feast celebrated 
the Pilgrims’ first harvest in the 
New World, but it can’t really be 
called the beginning of the tradi­
tion, since it was never repeated. 
(Ethnic warfare and typhoid, I 
imagine, got in the way.)
While American colonists of­
ten participated in days of thank­
ful feasting and prayer, the first 
official Thanksgiving of the new 
nation didn’t take place until 
the bitter winter of 1777, when 
George Washington and his army 
stopped in Valley Forge, Pa., to 
observe the holiday. Incidentally, 
the first official proclamation of 
Washington’s presidency declared 
November 26 a national day of 
“thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Thanksgiving wasn’t codi­
fied into a yearly national holiday 
until 1863, when Sarah J. Hale, 
“editress” of Lady’s Book, wrote 
a letter to President Abraham 
Lincoln on September 28. Hale 
argued that, for the sake of na­
tional unity, President Lincoln 
should declare a specific date for 
the traditional feast.
Five days later, Lincoln issued 
a proclamation. Even in the thick 
of a devastating civil war, in the 
wake of the Battle of Gettysburg, 
Lincoln wrote of a prosper­
ing Union, one that “no human 
counsel hath devised nor hath 
any mortal hand worked out.” 
As such, the Union’s blessings 
“should be solemnly, reverently, 
and gratefully acknowledged, 
as with one heart and voice by 
the whole American people.” 
Lincoln’s Thanksgiving fell ex- 
acdy one week after his delivery 
of the Gettysburg Address.
It would not be the last time 
that Thanksgiving came to the 
aid of American morale. In 1939, 
President Roosevelt moved the 
holiday up one week, to the third 
Thursday of November, in order to 
lengthen the Christmas shopping 
season and boost the economy. 
That act might not have the same 
historical resonance as Lincoln’s 
proclamation of gratitude, but it 
speaks to Thanksgiving’s power 
as an American tradition. (In 
1941, FDR returned the holi­
day to the fourth Thursday of 
November, where it remains.)
I’d be waxing patriotic if I 
said Americans had “one heart 
and voice.” But the truth is that 
Thanksgiving has appeared most 
prominently in our history dur­
ing times of strife: the hardships 
of colonialism, the cold struggle 
of revolution, the civic blood of 
civil war, and the poverty at the 
threshold of world war.
And today we are at war, with 
. weapons overseas and words on 
home soil. And many of us are 
impoverished. So let us heed the 
words of evangelical scholar W.T. 
Purkiser: “Not what we say about 
our blessings, but how we use 
them, is the true measure of our 
thanksgiving.”

An article explaining the

fall to civil war will make their 
sacrifices all in vain.
Worst of all, the Iraqi people 
really have no problems of their 
own. Our soldiers, bombs, and 
warplanes have destroyed their 
country. Our actions have desta­
bilized the region. Our gung-ho
invasion has scattered enemies 
to every dark corner of each Iraqi 
city, where they wait for the in­
nocent victims who our soldiers 
are meant to protect.
As the situation in Iraq falls 
apart, the stakes for victory 
become even higher. Though 
President Bush has become open 
to new strategies since the mid­
term elections, we must not be­

Iraqi people and force them to 
clean up the mess that we have 
created.
If we want our soldiers to 
come home, we should place a 
little more trust in General John 
Abizaid, chief of U.S. Central 
Command. President Bush is 
right in making troop movements 
contingent on the conditions in 
Iraq. And right now the general 
says the conditions call for more 
troops. A premature withdrawal 
would prove disastrous for the 
country.

A PERSON’S OPINION
Compiled by Joshua Bordin and Hannah Rosen
Kelly Cahill
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for 
Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan 
opened in theaters on November 3, and 
with it came controversy. In the faux docu­
mentary, Sacha Baron Cohen poses as 
Borat Sagdiyev, a Kazakh reporter investi­
gating American culture.
Baron Cohen’s fictional character has 
earned many a raised eyebrow and disap­
proving head shake for his near constant 
stream of offensive statements. During 
the movie, Borat refers to an African- 
American politician as a “chocolate face,” 
blames Jews for the attacks on September 
11, and asserts that women’s brains are 
the size of squirrels’. He simply cannot 
grasp the imperative of female consent in 
sexual relations or why Americans don’t 
see the humor in mental retardation.
Naturally, everyone is up in arms. Many 
Americans are offended by Borat’s dis­
tasteful display, and Kazakhs are insulted 
by the way he portrays the country. To 
counteract the damage that Borat has 
done to its public image, Kazakhstan has 
launched a huge publicity campaign of 
ads in The New York Times and U.S. News & 
World Report as well as late-night network 
television spots that portray Kazakhstan 
as economically stable and accepting of 
diversity.
Still, the foundation of the humor in 
Borat is Americans’ reactions to Borat’s 
cultural misunderstandings and misrep­
resentations. And Americans’ indelicate 
statements are what’s really offensive 
in this movie. Preceding Borat’s perfor­
mance of a fictional version of the Kazakh 
national anthem at a rodeo in Virginia, 
he meets with the rodeo’s general man­
ager. In response to Borat’s allegation that 
homosexuals are jailed and hanged in 
Kazakhstan, the general manager replies 
in a lazy Southern drawl, “That’s what 
we’re trying to get done here.” Later, a 
packed stadium of rodeo-goers claps as 
Borat bestows a myriad of Kazakh bless­
ings on the Americans’ war in Iraq. The 
applause continues loudly even as Borat 
advocates George W. Bush drinking the
opinions is to completely miss the point. 
Borat is a caricature, not a character. Baron 
Cohen dons an outdated suit, a thick mus­
tache, and a strong accent, claims to be 
Kazakh, and Americans are moré than 
willing to believe his ridiculously over­
blown sexism and racism are authentic. 
He parodies vague American assumptions 
that non-western or non-Americanized 
countries are oppressive and intolerant. 
Americans don’t feel uncomfortable talk­
ing about some of their own bigotry and 
prejudices around a character like Borat.
It seems obvious, or it should, that 
Borat’s racist and misogynistic statements 
aren’t real. They are so clearly hyper­
bolic that they are unbelievable. Borat 
claims that Jews are horned shape-shifters 
and among the top three problems facing 
modern Kazakhstan. He believes women 
aren’t merely less intelligent then men, 
they have been medically proven to have 
miniscule brains.
Baron Cohen, who created the character 
Borat, is not anti-Semitic or misogynistic. 
He is, in reality, a Cambridge-educated 
man who speaks with the pinched, nasal 
accent of an upper-class Briton. He is a 
devout Jew who speaks fluent Hebrew. 
Baron Cohen is obviously not espousing 
the views of Borat or even really saying 
that they’re funny. What is supposed to be 
funny about his act are the reactions that 
Borat garners from apparently unsuspect­
ing Americans.
How can one find Borat’s feigned state­
ments offensive when they are juxtaposed 
with Americans’ actual ones? Americans’ 
ruthless homophobia, imperialism, rac­
ism, and misogyny are what truly offend 
in this movie. Borat really has exposed 
some “Cultural Learnings of America.” 
Despite the quickness with which we 
Americans jump onto our soapboxes and 
our high horses when it comes to demo­
cratic values and tolerance, it appears that 
we still have a ways to go when it comes to 
actual equality in this country. No need to 
worry, Kazakhstan. The country that re­
ally requires a major publicity make-over 
is America.
Kelly Cahill (kcahill@J loves Borat but is 
tired of lame impressions. She is a sopho­
more majoring in creative and professional 
writing, and welcomes responses in the 
Queen’s English only.
As the Democrats move into 
the halls of Congress, they are 
urging American soldiers to 
move out of Iraq.
Senator Carl Levin from 
Michigan is the Democrats’ pick 
to be the new Armed Services 
Committee chairman. He has 
created a timetable that will 
begin removing American 
troops from Iraq within the 
next six months. Last week, the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette printed 
this quotation from the Senator: 
“The point of this [plan to with­
draw] is to signal to the Iraqis 
that the open-ended commit­
ment is over and that they are 
going to have to deal with their 
own problems.”
Since the article was printed 
last Monday, some new events 
have unfurled which show that 
the Iraqis’ “own problems” may 
soon be a full-blown civil war in
Michael Menchaca/Art Staff
blood of all Iraqis.
Later on, Borat attempts to hitchhike to 
Hollywood. He eventuallyjoins three loud, 
inarticulate frat boys in an RV, students 
from a university in South Carolina. A 
predictable cacophony of drunken shout­
ing and expletives ensues. One of the polo- 
shirted fraternity brothers expresses his 
regret that slavery is no longer permitted 
in America and claims America would be 
better off without Jews. The same young
man tells Borat that he shouldn’t feel bad 
about a woman breaking his heart because 
he is bigger and better than a woman.
Now who’s offensive? Of course, Borat’s 
statements, if taken as truthful, offend 
our sensibilities. As Americans, we believe 
in the equality of all races, genders, and 
religions. We don’t oppress our people. 
We’re politically correct. We’re democratic. 
Right?

Coming off of a 5-20 season 
last year, the Carnegie Mel­
lon women’s basketball team 
opened its 2006-07 campaign 
last weekend with two wins, 
quickly erasing Jast season’s 
shortcomings. Defeating Villa 
Julie College 70-62 on Saturday 
and Penn State-Altoona 86-60 
on Sunday, the Tartans took 
the Terry Greene Tip Off Classic 
championship title.
The tournament was held at 
Franklin & Marshall College in 
Lancaster, Pa.
On Saturday, Carnegie Mellon 
opened with an early 9-0 lead
in the first few minutes of the 
game. The Villa Julie Mustangs 
fought back, taking a 28-24 
lead going into the second half. 
The Tartans pulled ahead for 
good with 16 minutes left in the 
game, extending their lead by 
eight points by the game’s end.
Sophomore Ashley Rothwell 
shot six of eight from the field, 
recording a career-high 18 
points. Junior guard Leah Feola 
and sophomore guard Colleen 
Light each had 16 points and 
eight rebounds. Feola added five 
assists and three blocks for the 
Tartans.
On Sunday, in the champion­
ship game against Penn State- 
Altoona, the Tartans again 
took control of the game early,
amassing a 16-point lead and 
going into the second half with a 
41-26 advantage. Carnegie Mel­
lon never gave up its lead, win­
ning the game by 26 points.
Light led the Tartans with 
a career-high 21 points. Feola 
added 15 points, and Roth­
well recorded 12 points and 10 
rebounds. Sophomore guard 
Stacie Aleski collected 11 points, 
nine assists, and three steals 
during the game.
Light and Rothwell were 
named to the all-tournament 
team, and Light was named the 
most valuable player of the tour­
nament.
The Tartans return to play on 
Saturday when they host Thiel 
College in a 6 p.m. game.

City was a team win,” Matta 
said. “We produced offerisively 
and defensively. A couple of us, 
including myself, got into foul 
trouble, but others stepped up 
and put forth the effort and we 
played really well.”
The Tartans held Grove City 
to 34 percent shooting from the 
field and out-rebounded the Wol­
verines 43-25. Carnegie Mellon 
held a 32-22 lead at halftime, 
and Grove City could get no 
closer than six points through­
out the second half.
“These first two games, we’ve 
gone and competed,” Matta said. 
“As a co-captain, I’m so proud of 
these guys. We’ve played with 
poise and really played as a 
team. It’s come from just being 
together on and off the court and 
learning to rely on each other 
more. Our goals for the season 
are basically the same goals we 
have every year. We want to win 
the West Penn Classic, which we 
did this past weekend. We want 
to win our holiday tournament, 
win the University Athletic As­
sociation, and enter the NCAA 
tournament.”
The men’s basketball team will 
next be in action this weekend 
when they host the Radisson/ 
Carnegie Mellon Tournament 
on Saturday and Sunday. The 
Tartans play Penn State-Fayette 
at 3 p.m. on Saturday.

Last Saturday, the Carnegie 
Mellon swimming and diving 
teams competed in their first 
double-dual meet of the season 
against Franklin & Marshall Col­
lege and Washington & Lee Uni­
versity at Lancaster, Pa. The Tar­
tan women edged out W&L 168 to 
94 points, but tied F&M with 131 
points. The men’s team easily de­
feated F&M 216 to 45 points, but 
lost a close race to W&L, 113 to 
149 points.
For the women’s team, junior 
Alex Kinzler finished first in the 
100-yard breaststroke (1:08.75). 
Kinzler also placed first in the 
200-yard breaststroke (2:29.22) 
and second in the 200-yard IM 
(2:14.20).
Behind Kinzler, senior Jenny 
Sieger (1:10.28) and first-year 
Sara Andrews (1:11.58) finished 
second and third, respectively, 
in the 100-yard breaststroke. In 
the 50:yard freestyle, Sieger took 
first place with a time of 24.87, 
with Andrews finishing third 
with a time of 26.10.
Juniors Xiao-Lan Wong, Lau­
ren Connell, and Anna Kochalko 
also finished on the podium for 
Carnegie Mellon. Wong placed 
first in the 200-yard butter­
fly (2:18.20), Connell won the 
100-yard freestyle (54.48), and 
Kochalko placed second in the 
200-yard butterfly (2:20.28) 
and third in the 200-yard breast­
stroke (2:20.28) and 1000-yard 
freestyle (11:10.19).
Sophomore Colleen Murphy 
took third in the 200-yard back­
stroke with a time of 2:18.01. Fel­
low sophomore Allison Retotar 
finished third in the 100-yard 
butterfly (1:02.49).

of F&M with a time of 3:40.47. 
The Tartan ‘B’ team stepped up to 
come in fourth place overall with 
a time of 3:53.18. The combina­
tion of the first- and fourth-place 
finishes for the women’s 400- 
yard relay teams helped Carn-
John Johnson had back-to-back 
second- and third-place finishes 
in the 100- and 200-yard back­
stroke. Dukes took second in 
the 100-yard race with a time of

The Carnegie Mellon football team takes a knee aifter its win on Saturday. The Tartans shut out Millsaps College, 
collecting three touchdowns during the second half of the game.

The men’s basketball team 
opened its season this past 
weekend at the West Penn Clas­
sic, collecting victories over 
Washington & Jefferson Col­
lege 77-66 late Friday night and 
Grove City College 70-52 on 
Saturday.
The Tartans traveled to W&J 
Friday. Neither team could gain 
a substantial lead throughout 
the game, with the Tartans up 
36-34 at halftime.
A free throw by W&J tied the 
game at 64 with 3:59 left, but 
the Tartans controlled the game 
from that point on. Carnegie 
Mellon ended the game on a 
13-2 run, holding the Presidents 
to zero field goals over the final 
four minutes.
Sophomore forward Ryan 
Einwag led the Tartans, shoot­
ing 7-11 with 22 points. Junior 
guard Geoff Kozak and senior 
guard Brad Matta each scored 
17 points, with Kozak dishing 
out four assists and Matta reel­
ing in seven rebounds.
“We were just able to execute 
better than them at the end of 
game,” Matta said. “People say 
we’re a young team and W&J was 
the team that had 99 percent of 
their scoring back, and four se­
nior starters, yet we didn’t play 
nervous.”
On Saturday, Carnegie Mel­
lon used a balanced attack to 
defeat the Grove City Wolver­
ines 70-52. The Tartans showed 
their depth by receiving strong 
bench play, and showed their 
balance by having four players 
score in double figures.
Einwag and sophomore for­
ward Jon Wollebon led the way 
with 11 points apiece. Kozak
“We’ve played 
with poise and 
really played as a

—Brad Matta
and first-year forward Jack An­
derson each scored 10 points in 
the win, with Anderson going
4-4 from the field and hitting 
both of his three-point shots.
Sophomore center Rob Pear­
son had the best game of his 
career, coming off the bench to 
haul down 13 rebounds, block 
five shots, and score seven 
points.

egie Mellon come from behind to

The 400-yard freestyle relay 
team’s time of 3:40:47 was the 
fastest time of the season by a 
significant margin. “If memory 
serves, there was only one swim 
last year that the women’s team 
swam faster than this time,” 
head coach David Belowich said. 
“So I’m really, really pleased with 
the relay team. I’m delighted 
with what they’re accomplishing 
as a team.”
“I think overall our team did 
really well. There was a lot of 
good competition and a lot of 
people really fought hard to win 
the races,” Kochalko said.
On the men’s team, senior Dave 
Krzeminski placed first in both 
the 100- and 200-yard butterfly 
with times of 51.72 and 1:55.86, 
respectively.
In the 1000-yard freestyle, 
first-year Jonas Kurosaki and 
sophomore Tom McConnell fin­
ished first and second with times 
of 10:01.50 and 10:02.80, re­
spectively. McConnell also took 
second in the 500-yard freestyle 
with a time of 4:53.76.
First-vears Reece Dukes and
cess, first-year Andrew Seo won 
the 100- and 200-yard breast­
stroke with times of 1:00.53 and 
2:11.37, respectively. Seo also 
finished second in the 200-yard 
IM with a time of 2:00.27.
The Tartans’ A’ teams placed 
second in the 200-yard medley 
relay and the 400-yard freestyle 
relay. Dukes, Seo, Krzeminski, 
and sophomore Ron Papa clocked 
in a time of 1:37.99 for the 200- 
yard medley, and in the 400-yard 
relay, Krzeminski, junior Patrick 
Snyder, Papa, and junior Mi­
chael Bailey finished with a time 
of 3:11:58. In both relays, the 
Tartans finished second behind 
W&L.
“On the men’s side, Washington
& Lee is a very good and nation­
ally ranked team,” Belowich 
said. “They kind of out-depth us 
in the sprint freestyle — that’s 
really their major strength — but 
I thought we swam extremely 
well.”
The Tartans will return to 
Grove City College for the two- 
day James Longnecker Invitation

drive when sophomore quarterback Doug Facemyer 
connected with senior wide out Mark Davis for a

a wave of tacklers for 10 yards and his second touch­
down on the afternoon. That two-touchdown edge 
proved to be all Carnegie Mellon would need.

Carnegie Mellon football tramples Majors
¦m
by Adam Lazarus
Staffwriter
All season long, a photograph of the 
1990 Tartans loomed above the play­
ers’ entrance at Gesling Stadium as a 
monument to the program’s last perfect 
regular season. Saturday morning, be­
fore his team’s first NCAA playoff game 
since that special group 16 years ago, 
Tartan head coach Rich Lackner taped 
over that portrait a photo of the 2006 
Tartans to honor Carnegie Mellon’s new­
est undefeated team.-
If there was any doubt as to the stabil­
ity of Lackner’s hasty pre-game tape job, 
later that afternoon, the Tartans went 
out and secured their place in Carnegie 
Mellon football lore by hammering Mill­
saps College (Miss!) for their first NCAA 
playoff win in 28 years.
Following a recipe that launched 
them to 10 consecutive regular-season
victories — powerful running backed 
up by clutch defense — the Tartans 
dominated the second half against the 
visiting Majors. The 21-0 victory earned 
Carnegie Mellon a trip to Dover, Del., 
where Division Ill’s third-ranked Wesley 
College Wolverines (11-0) will host next 
week’s second-round matchup.
A scoreless first half that included nine 
punts, two turnovers (both by Millsaps), 
and a missed field goal set the stage for 
an apparent wire-to-wire finish. But 
two early-third-quarter touchdowns 
and three second-half turnovers by the 
Majors propelled the Tartans to an 11th 
consecutive victory.
“If you look at Carnegie Mellon offen­
sively, it’s a situation where you better 
have a plan to stop the run. They had a 
lot of people in the box and it was tough 
going there early on,” Lackner said. “I 
think it just got to a situation there early 
in the middle of the third quarter where 
I think we started to wear them down a
little bit.”
The third-ranked rushing offense in 
Division III gave the Tartans an enor­
mous advantage in time of possession. 
By controlling the ball for 40:15 over 67 
plays, for 260 yards, the offense limited 
the explosive Majors attack to just 32 
plays in the second half.
Able to garner only five yards on 19 
carries on the ground, the Majors turned 
to their nationally 19th-ranked passing 
attack to get back in the game. But each 
time Millsaps, which averaged 33 points 
per game this season, inched closer to 
breaking through, the Tartan defense 
came up with a big play.
“We knew going in it was a great de­
fense, a great football team, period,” 
Millsaps head coach Mike DuBose said. 
“I’ve been very impressed with them de­
fensively. I do not feel like we did a good 
job of handling their pressure; we could 
not establish any running game, and 
when you can’t run it and you can’t han­
dle pressure it’s going to be a long day.” 
Trailing 14-0 early in the fourth quar­
ter, Millsaps quarterback Juan Joseph 
led the Majors 63 yards over 13 plays 
to the Tartan 17-yard line, but Carnegie 
Mellon sophomore defensive lineman 
Steve Curran reached up and seized a 
Joseph screen-pass out of the air for his 
first career interception to end the scor­
ing threat.
On the following Millsaps drive, se­
nior defensive back Jonathon Scholl 
hauled in Joseph’s next throw deep over 
the middle at the Millsaps 46-yard line to 
give the Tartans their fourth turnover.
“The defensive line did a great job to­
day to got pressure on the quarterback,” 
said Scholl, who led the team with seven 
solo tackles. “Also, the linebackers, they 
pretty much took out the whole running 
game. That allowed the defensive sec­
ondary to concentrate on the pass.”
On the ensuing possession, junior run­
ning back Robert Gimson (23 carries,
Justin Brown/Assistant Photo Editor
142 yards) put the game out of reach at 
21-0 when his 17-yard touchdown run 
capped an eight-play drive that drained 
the clock to under five minutes.
“We’re a physical football team,” 
Gimson said. “Our offensive line works 
together as a unit as well as, I think, any 
offensive line in the country. When we 
find a formation and mismatches that 
work to our favor, we exploit them. We 
found some good formations and some 
good plays, and our offensive line did a 
great job.”
Gimson — the main outside threat — 
and between-the-tackles runner Travis 
Sivek (25 carries, 109 yards) accounted 
for all three Tartan touchdowns and be­
came the first duo in school history to 
each top 1000 yards rushing in the same 
season.

Last Sunday, the men’s soccer 
team ended its season with a 
3-0 win over Westminster Col­
lege to capture the East Coast 
Athletic Conference (ECAC) 
title. This win also marked the 
end of senior forward Jona­
than Browne’s collegiate career. 
Browne — the Tartans’ all-time 
leading point and goal leader
— ended the season with two 
goals during the Westminster 
game.
Browne was honored as the 
most outstanding player during 
the ECAC championship and as 
the men’s soccer Athlete of the 
Week by the University Athletic 
Association (UAA). Last week, 
Browne sat down with The Tar­
tan to give a little insight into 
his accomplishments on the 
soccer field.
Tartan: When did you first 
start playing soccer? How "did 
you get into the sport?
Browne: I started playing 
when I was about five or six 
years old. My parents signed 
me up for the youth leagues and 
club, you know, just to get me 
into something, and I really just 
stuck with it from there.
T: Did you always plan on 
playing soccer when you got to 
college?
B: Yes. I always really en­
joyed it; I still absolutely love 
playing. I had so many friends 
that played and we all really
just wanted to keep playing, so I 
knew I would play in college.
T: How do you deal with 
Carnegie Mellon academics and 
soccer?
B: It’s pretty much like all 
your professors tell you: time 
management. I’ve just had to 
learn how to manage my time 
well and not fall behind. It’s 
a lot of work but you know it’s 
worth it.
T: What do you do to relax at 
Carnegie Mellon?
B: Well, soccer is somewhat 
relaxing, and then, when I get 
free time, I basically just fin­
ish off my work, and catch up 
on some sleep or sit back and 
watch some TV.
T: What do you focus on dur­
ing a game to stay competitive?
B: I absolutely hate losing. I 
pretty much just focus on win­
ning the game — and what I can 
keep doing to help win a game
— because I can’t stand to lose.
T: Any particular accomplish­
ments you are proud of?
B: I am pretty proud of the 
points and goals records. I had
the goals record last year, but 
was still a few points short of 
the point record, and was really 
glad I was able to get that ear­
lier this year.
T: Do you have a most memo­
rable game?
B: Not so much one particu­
lar game, but basically every 
year when we play Emory, we 
have a pretty unforgettable 
game. We don’t like them, and 
pretty much every year it comes 
down to that game to win the 
UAA or conference. Plus we’ve 
beat them the past few years, so 
they’re nice memories,
T: Where’s your favorite place 
to travel to?
B: Well my favorite place that
I have ever gotten to go to is 
Cancún.
With traveling for soccer, I 
would have to say Emory is ac­
tually my favorite place to go 
to.- Normally we head down 
there in November, so it’s freez­
ing here, and then we land 
down there and it’s 75 degrees 
and sunny out. It’s a nice little 
change and we have one of 
those good games. It makes for 
a nice weekend.

Prior to the Division III national 
championship, the biggest race of 
the men’s cross country team’s 
season, head coach Dario Do- 
natelli expressed his confidence 
and faith in his team. “The team 
feels like we are establishing a 
tradition where going to nationals 
will be an annual event,” Donatelli 
said. “Our goal is top 20. Last 
year we were eighth, but our top 
three [runners] graduated.” The 
Tartans surpassed their coach’s 
expectations to finish with an im­
pressive 12th place out 32 teams 
at Saturday’s championship held 
at Voice of America Park in West 
Chester, Ohio.
Calvin College won the overall 
team title with 37 points. New 
York University finished in second 
place with 92 points, followed 
by Allegheny College with 212. 
Carnegie Mellon finished with 
329 points.
In the 8K race, sophomore 
Brian Harvey led the team with a 
time of 27:59, finishing 46th over­
all. Behind Harvey, sophomore 
Breck Fresen finished second for 
the team and 53rd overall with a 
time of 28:04.
Senior captain Geoff Misek and 
first-year Dario Donatelli finished 
\
the race 74th and 83rd overall 
with times of 28:18 and 28:23, re­
spectively.
“As team captain I’m very proud 
of the team’s performance today,” 
Misek said. “We ran much better 
than anyone anticipated, much 
of which is owed to Breck’s clutch 
performance.”
In fifth place for the team, junior 
Jason Jura crossed the finish line 
with a time of 29:21. Sophomores 
Mike Haley and Ryan Anderson 
finished with times of 30:34 and 
30:58, respectively.
“Obviously the competition 
was the best Division III had to of­
fer, so we had to step up and run a 
great team race,” Anderson said. 
“It was an important time to show 
what we were truly capable of af­
ter a season of good training.”
The men’s team will end yet 
another successful cross country 
season on a high note. The Tar­
tans can look forward to an even 
better season next year because 
all of their top 10 runners will re­
turn to the team. .
“We had a great season af­
ter losing three runners, one 
of which came in fifth last year 
[at nationals], so of course I’m 
proud. We were ranked 23rd go­
ing in, and came out 12th, so we 
ran well,” Anderson said. “It’s all 
about Coach [Donatelli], ‘The 
Godfather.’ ”

Quick: Paper or plastic?
Alum stars in new TBS show 10 Items or Less
Six years after School of Drama alumna Roberta 
Valderrama ('00) graduated, she landed her first 
regular role on television. She will be starring 
in 10 Items or Less, a sitcom of less than epic 
proportions about the quirky staff of a grocery 
store (Greens & Grains) premiering next Monday 
on TBS.
Improv actor and show creator John Lehr stars 
as Leslie Pool, a man returning to Ohio to run a 
grocery store he just inherited from his father. 
According to the press release, 10 Items or Less 
is the first in a slate of late-night comedy series 
being developed by the network.
10 Items or Less incorporates both improvisation 
and traditional sitcom scripting. "As soon as you 
get on the set," said Valderrama, "the director 
gives us a little backstory and the basic gist 
of the scene and then lets us loose. It’s mostly 
unscripted; the actors know nothing about the 
storylines in advance. The creators just write an 
outline about where they want the story to go and 
they’ll say, 'You’re looking for the manager — you 
can’t stand him — now come up with 10 different 
instances about things that could go wrong for 
which you go to the customer service desk and 
find the manager... And go.”'
As might' be expected, hijinks ensue:
Another scenario involves the therapy sharing 
circle for the store’s employees. Sounds a bit like 
The Office, doesn’t it? Valderrama's character, 
Yolanda Nelson, is pregnant and the identity of 
the child's father is a bit murky. “So basically, I’m 
supposed to let the cat out of the bag [as to who 
the father is],” said Valderrama, “and the rest of 
the cast will improv it out."
Much of the cast had a great deal of prior improv 
experience, but Valderrama's improv skills 
originated in her School of Drama curriculum, 
especially in acting classes and movement 
classes with Kaf Warman.
The cast of 10 Items or Less comprises many 
actors who have previously had small roles in 
other popular shows. According to TBS, “The 
somewhat dysfunctional staff at the Greens & 
Grains includes Carl (Robert Clendenin — That 
70s Show), the sweet, doofus stockboy who 
serves as Leslie’s sidekick; Yolanda (Roberta 
Valderrama — ER), the sharp-tongued dominant 
force in the produce department; Buck (Greg 
Davis Jr. — The King of California), the bagger 
who is looking towards the future by attending 
night school; Ingrid (Kirsten Gronfield — Steve 
Saves L.A.), the quirky, soft-spoken customer 
service representative who lives for Renaissance 
festivals; Richard (Christopher Liam Moore — 
Judging Amy), the dignified cashier who dreams 
of becoming a professional ice dancer; and Todd 
(Chris Payne Gilbert — The Broken Hearts Club),
the sexy butcher who hopes to one day to be a 
stock car driver.”
According to Valderrama, Carnegie Mellon’s 
high prices and pressure-cooker environment 
are what prepared her most for the rigors of 
the actjng business. Not only did the School of 
Drama prepare her in terms of the curriculum and 
networking opportunities, but it also developed 
her work ethic and her tenacity. Valderrama put 
herself through college and worked five jobs to 
stay in school — including a stint as a cook at 
Skibo. “I also lived, in a kitchen pantry once for 
$80 a month," she said, "and with the cut system 
looming overhead, slacking off wasn't an option. 
Just that spirit of trying to make it and not taking 
no for an answer prepared me for the last six 
years, hitting the pavement until I got what I 
wanted."
Although 10 Items or Less is by far her favorite 
gig, she has also had small roles in other 
major network television shows, including the 
abovementioned role on NBC’s ER, on which she 
played a candy-striper who stalked an attractive 
doctor.
Valderrama advises current aspiring actors and 
drama students to "keep doing what you’re 
doing, if you really believe in yourself. Don’t listen 
to the naysaysers about the business. CMU gives 
you the tools you need. Being in a conservatory 
for four years is just the beginning of the battle.”
"I would love to get the support from Pittsburgh 
and my alma mater,” said Valderrama. “Watch my 
show. It has so much heart but is still a little edgy 
and definitely hilarious."

The following obscure quote was published in

The Carnegie Institute of Technology shot to

all-around sharpshooters edged past Brown to

competition. As we gaze toward the start of 
this year’s college basketball season, we find it’s 
funny how much times have changed.
Much to the dismay of graduate students, 
President Richard Cyert decided to raise 
tuition more than 20 percent for the upcoming 
academic year. This increase came as a shock 
to students, who paid a substantial amount 
as it was. Following the increase, they were 
forced to a pay a whopping $7500, which is 
approximately how much current students pay 
for parking.
A University Police officer responded to a 
complaint filed by a Donner resident. The student, 
residing on the third floor of the dorm, witnessed

Diamonds and a down comforter
David Bavas is ambiguous and ordinary, but Nicole Atkins is the new Jersey kid
David Bavas, David Bavas and the Down Comforter
David Bavas’ hushed voice holds promises of tender melodies 
between its raspy edges; possibly another Jakob Dylan 
emerging from the endless pit of singer/songwriters. On 
his debut full-length album, Bavas begins with a simple 
country ballad. With ambiguous lyrics filled with meaningless 
imagery, "Sorry" makes for a weak opener. The next song, 
“Crazy,” quickens the pace to a pleasant mid-tempo pop song. 
The upbeat and bright guitars provide a nice contrast from 
Bavas’ nonchalant (and often uninterested) vocals.
As the album progresses, however, Bavas’ narrow range 
of musical styling sticks out like a sore thumb. Every song, 
aside from “Crazy” and “River," is a slow-moving ballad with 
simple lyrics, running around themes of heartbreak, regret, 
and confusion, and even simpler melodies. At times, Bavas’ 
calm voice drops to an incomprehensible mumble, leaving 
the listener with slow strumming guitars, soft drums, and 
the occasional cello or lap steel guitar. But it’s hard to blame 
him for sounding bored with lyrics as vague and detached as 
“Rainy day, just go away, leave me alone tonight."
Based in Seattle, Wash., Bavas has been playing gigs since 
2004, including this year’s South by Southwest Festival. 
Maybe his live act is more engaging than David Bavas and 
the Down Comforter. But as it stands, this album is far too 
ordinary and flat to make any impact on anyone’s collection.
There is one experience that all New Jersey natives can relate 
to: realizing the town you grew up in — that you thought 
was beautiful — is actually a piece of crap (save for a few 
exceptions). But you can still love a piece of crap, can’t you? 
Springsteen sure found a way. Now there’s a new Jersey kid 
on the horizon: female vocalist Nicole Atkins.
The album’s opener and title track begins lightly with 
regretful lyrics and builds towards a mighty climax saturated 
with strings and bells. Following with the lighthearted 
“Snowshakes," Atkins hits a perfect combination of accuracy 
and laxness in her syncopated melody. She sings, “Let the 
radio go on 'til after I'm long gone." These moments pepper 
the album to add an extra kick of quirkiness to each of the 
graceful songs. Atkins shows a lot of potential on this EP and 
will hopefully take her smooth voice to similar heights on a 
full-length album.
Nicole Atkins, Bleeding Diamonds EP
In “Neptune City,” Atkins croons about a bittersweet return 
to her hometown. Though her words reflect more of the bitter 
side, her voice sweeps theatrically over the melodies as the 
piano tinkles, reminiscent of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow." 
On the rest of Bleeding Diamonds EP, Atkins displays her 
youthful, grandiose voice quite tastefully over her backing 
band, The Sea, which balances Atkins’ strong presence with 
elegant'guitars, bright piano, powerful percussion, and light 
strings.

Engineer by day, DJ by night
Pittsburgh’s own mashup king returns home
Girl Talk, whose real name is Gregg Gillis, is not your 
ordinary DJ. In fact, he sells T-shirts on his website that 
say, “I'm not a DJ." Instead, Gillis considers himself a 
"producer and a laptop musician.” Though he plays 
other people's music, Gillis considers his work separate 
from that of the average DJ who is primarily concerned 
with transitions between songs. To Gillis, his laptop 
and extensive sampling library are his instruments, 
and every clip is a phrase or melodic line that he has 
"recontextualized. ”
Growing up in Pittsburgh, Gillis got into experimental 
music at a young age. Around the eighth grade, he 
became heavily influenced by local group Operation Re- 
Information, a computer keyboards-heavy band. “They 
showed me that you could play electronic music in 
Pittsburgh and still get an audience,” he said. Inspired, 
Gillis started to create music of his own.
Holding a degree in engineering from Case Western 
Reserve University, Gillis now works just outside 
of Pittsburgh as a biomedical engineer. Gillis is a 
musician and an engineer. He plays music after his job 
at night, and tours heavily on the weekends. Asked if 
anyone at work knew about his second job, Gillis said, 
"I'm semi-secretive about it. Since I’m working with a 
conservative crowd, I guess it would be hard to explain 
how and why I leave the city every weekend.”
After the release of his third and latest record, Night 
Ripper, Gillis blew up on the experimental, electronic, 
and indie rock scenes. After hearing avant-garde 
electronic groups like Aphex Twin, Gillis added 
a heavier backbeat to his music, making it more 
accessible to mainstream audiences. "I've always 
loved pop music, and I’ve always been fascinated 
by the re-contextualization of it,” he said. For Gillis, 
what's important is having recognizable elements and 
references in his music. But the astounding part of any 
Girl Talk song is not the quantity of samples, but the 
breadth of the genres he has touched on: Dr. Dre rubs 
shoulders with Phantom Planet and Mariah Carey in 
the same song. In another: 50 Cent, James Taylor, and 
Weezer. Gillis said about his work, "It’s original music 
with blatantly recognizable elements and samples."
Gillis has run into some criticism throughout his career. 
People occasionally condemn his music for being so 
gimmicky. He says that far too many people are stuck 
on the amount of samples he has in his music that they 
neglect to listen further. "It's weird music," he admitted. 
"I like breaking down barriers and confusing people.”
Gillis has also been criticized for having made an album 
almost entirely made with samples. To Gillis, sampling 
is just another instrument. “There are no original music 
concepts anyways," he said. "Even if it’s subconscious, 
and even if your music isn't sampled, it’s still based on
another idea. Sampling is an original idea, except with 
more blatant influence from other ideas. It's really all 
about how you present your idea in its context."
And despite the criticisms, Girl Talk’s fan base 
continues to skyrocket. With the growing popularity, 
Gillis has been approached by major labels to produce 
tracks and do remixes for artists on big labels. Although 
currently signed to indie label Illegal Art, Gillis is eager 
to get involved in the business, saying that corporate 
music "fascinates” him.
Although he has no specific plans for the future, Gillis 
will continue to remix, produce, and — of course — to 
mash.
Girl Talk will be performing at WRCT, Carnegie Mellon's 
radio station, tonight. Tune in to 88.3 FM at 9p.m. to 
hear the show. He will also be performing with The 
Modey Lemon and Centipede E'est at Belvedere's on 
Friday.

On the origins of goth
For most, the genre “goth/industrial” brings diverse musicians 
and bands like Marilyn Manson or Nine inch Naifs to mind, but the 
more musically conscious may make a clearer distinction between 
goth and industrial. To a certain extent, both parties are correct in 
their classifications, mainly because of the constant molding and 
remolding of music by a number of key musicians who draw from an 
extensive palette of inspiration,
Goth and industrial started out as different types of music, but they 
both have roots in some form of social commentary. Originating 
in the early to mid-1970s, the term "industrial music” was coined 
by Industrial Records, a label created specifically for the release of 
experimental music by bands such as Throbbing Gristle. “Industrial,” 
at that point, was more of an ironic statement about how streamlined 
and formulaic music had become during that time, and these 
experimental musicians were not hesitant to use graphic and 
politically incorrect imagery alongside their music to make a social 
point — much akin to their cousin, punk music, which was itself in 
some ways the predecessor of goth music.
It may be surprising — but shouldn’t be shocking — that punk music 
preceded goth music. Punk, in all of its stripped-down structure, 
couldn’t possibly have survived in the long run. It was during this 
point that punk musicians started experimenting with more complex 
ways of expression through their music, particularly by developing 
an artistic sensitivity while still retaining a punk iconoclastic stance.
As the moody middle child between punk and pop-electro music 
that was prevalent at the time, bands such as Joy Division (and 
subsequently New Order), Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the 
Sisters of Mercy brought goth music out from punk/post-punk into 
gothic.
Today, goth and industrial have combined through shared aesthetics, 
subcultural survival, and even basic back-and-forth borrowing of 
styles. In this way, goth/industrial can be considered a single genre 
today. It draws from electronic music the most and, depending on 
the musician and amount of commercialization that the musician has 
been exposed to, the roots of goth and industrial can still be heard in 
the music.

W.S. Merwin, Pullitzer Prize- 
winning poet, read at Carnegie 
Lecture Hall.
K ' I
Justin Brown I Assistant Photo Editor
Speaking in a forgotten language
Award-winning poet W.S. Merwin visits Carnegie Lecture Hall
"If you are not impressed — you are un-impressable,” stated 
Samuel Hazo, the director of the Pittsburgh International 
Poetry Forum, when he introduced the 79-year-old man who 
sat placidly in the solitary armchair against the back wall of 
the Camegie Lecture Hall.
This man, W.S. Merwin, is a recipient of the National Book 
Award, the' Pulitzer Prize, the Tanning Prize, the Bollingen 
Prize, the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the Lannan Literary Lifetime 
Achievement Award, the Golden Wreath Award, and the 
Ambassador Book Award, as well as a selection by the Yale 
Series of Younger Poets; he also notably served as a Special 
Bicentennial Poet Laureate Consultant for the Library of 
Congress from 1999 to 2000. This man, poet, environmentalist, 
translator, essayist, and pacifist, still until his introduction was 
complete, rose to the podium and began with a poem related 
to "this part of the world."
Chronologically, from his roots in Pennsylvania to his travels 
across the country and the world, he began to recount a series 
of mostly narrative poems. He moved between stories of his 
family, of the eras from which specific poems were cast, and 
of his reflections back on the events of his own life. Certain 
poems brought the audience closer to him. "The Last One” is 
a narrative on the destruction of trees, where as the last one 
falls its shadow remains and begins to consume everything 
near it, just as the same beings that destroyed their 
environment attempt to remove all traces of its existence.
This poem, from his 1967 anthology The Lice, slowly pulled 
the audience to applause.
There was something that separated the poet from the 
audience. The poet, brashly courageous, revealed emotions 
through words that he seemed compelled to read aloud, a
dialogue with no response. But the audience this evening 
was in highest form, deliberately studying — much as one 
observes a great man. The women present stared lovingly; the 
men were intent on finding inspiration, as Merwin stood, fit, 
leafing through his most recent collection: Migration: New & 
Selected Poems.
Part of what separated the poet and the audience may have 
been his scholarship and his experience. As he invoked 
Kierkegaard’s view on thanks or the tale of the blind seer 
Georg Eberhard Rumphius, we sensed how much of the 
world he had studied, though it was clear that he had lived 
through just as much. From his stories of growing up with 
a Presbyterian minister, to his memories of conversations 
with once fellow poet Ted Hughes, we began to realize how 
many hidden layers there were. However, he knew this, and 
surely had witnessed that his audiences connect most with 
the poems that he prefaces with stories. One such poem is 
"Search Party,” his self-described closest attempt to emulate 
François Villon, who he named "one of the greatest poets, 
one of the worst men.” This poem tells the story of his search 
for a girl named Molly, and how in obsession he says, “You 
become a bore — my vocabulary got smaller, and I became 
rhythmical,” which he attributed to helping him create 
something near what Villon had.
Merwin has been translating works from-other languages 
nearly as long as he has been publishing his own work, 
across multiple languages and time periods. He offered to the 
audience only one small translated work, what is said to be 
the only poem ever written by the emperor Hadrian of Rome. 
Merwin said that this was a poem he frequently returned to 
for its simplicity and beauty, a poem so elegant that he didn’t 
believe it could truly be the only poem written by this man,
though possibly the only one saved.
Through the entire reading Merwin was remarkably 
human. As he told stories he paused, searching for the 
word he wanted to use; after a particular coughing jag he 
poked, “It must be your air; this is all your fault!” But most 
meaningfully, between the poems that he chose to give to us, 
he punctuated his reading with little fragments of thought, 
theories on life and literature. He spoke of the relationship 
of narrative to the realities of language, the finding of morals 
that were so clearly apparent only years after writing. To the 
people who have asked him what his plan is while writing, he 
always responded teasingly, “They think there was a plan.”
He told the story, having first moved to Hawaii, of living in 
a small house with a tin roof that leaked; he described it as 
"being in sort of a bad shower." And even in a house that was 
always flooded, he added that the worst part was not being 
able to talk with guests during showers as all one could hear 
was the rain — thus he knew that he would one day have a 
house (which he would later help to build) where he could 
hear not the rain on the roof, but only the rain in the trees. 
This, the title of his 1988 The Rain in The Trees, he said, is 
exemplified by the following short poem "Witness”: “I want 
to tell what the forests / were like /1 will have to speak / in 
a forgotten language." The poem illustrates all at once his 
accurate regard of nature, his direct and honest tone, which 
questions at the same time as it explains. VVhen we listened 
to Merwin speak, we were so inspired by the truths he so 
easily finds and teaches us that we believed all along that he 
had a plan, and that his plan has defined him as one of the 
greatest poets of his generation.

All hail The Pick of Destiny
Rockers Jack Black and Kyle Gass do justice to the big screen
The dynamic rocking duo of Jack Black and Kyle Gass 
have long claimed to be the greatest hard rock band in the 
world. The punchline of their best jokes are the performers 
themselves — two overweight, slovenly doofuses with 
acoustic guitars stepping up to the stage at a dive bar’s open- 
mic night. "How can these two jokers be the best band in the 
world?” asks the crowd, preparing to throw tomatoes and beer 
bottles.
When Gass starts playing and Black starts singing, Tenacious 
D starts rocking, and suddenly you’re convinced: These guys 
have chops. The riffs are catchy. The lyrics are hilariously 
over-the-top: equal parts self-told history, party anthem, and 
dragon-slaying imagery. Jack Black is bouncing all over the 
stage, and — wait, did he just say that he wants to ! @#$ you 
in yoUr %$&A with his $#@! of rock? You bet your @*%$ he 
did.
It's this mix of witty lyrics, shredding riffs (on acoustic six- 
strings), vulgar banter, endearing megalomania, mystical 
allegory, and obsessive worship of classic rock that has 
allowed Tenacious D to function. They can make you believe 
that they are truly the best band in the world; the tragedy is 
that the rest of the world doesn't know it yet.
Tenacious D first rose to fame on a series of HBO shorts that 
followed the duo as they attempted to get a record deal and 
wow the crowd at open-mic night. Tenacious D developed a 
rabid fan base from the shorts, but their career erupted like a 
Van Halen guitar solo with the release of their first album.
Tenacious D’s 2001 self-titled album is perhaps the greatest 
fusion of hard rock and humor ever created — This is Spinal 
Tap is the only possible comparison. Although the album
carried on the D’s endearing mix of rock anthems and ribald 
chitchat (the themes of which can not be reprinted here since 
this is a family newspaper), the album’s production was the 
true shock: Like Bob Dylan at the 1965 Newport Festival, 
Tenacious D had gone electric.
Produced by the Dust Brothers, Tenacious D took both new 
and old material and cranked it ajl up to 11. Maybe even 11.5 
or 12. The D used electric guitars and synthesizers for soaring 
highs and added drums, courtesy of Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl, 
for punishing, earth-shaking lows. The album sounded about 
a million miles away from two guys with acoustics on open- 
mic night. At the same time, the beauty of the production was 
that the album probably sounded exactly like Tenacious D • 
always imagined that they did in their heads.
It was an epic alteration of their core sound that likely earned 
the band 10 fans for every old fan they alienated. Although the 
songs were still mainly tributes to Black’s and Gass’ sexual 
prowess and rocking powers, the newly bombastic sound 
connected the album to the metal bands that influenced its 
creation. One song, "Dio,” even went so far as to demand 
that Ronnie James Dio (of Black Sabbath) step down so that 
Tenacious D could ascend to his throne.
This all worked beautifully in Tenacious D’s favor: The album 
sold briskly and produced four singles, including "Wonderboy" 
and "Tribute," an ode to an unnamed greatest song in the 
world.
Enter 2006: After stealing the show in High Fidelity and 
starring in School of Rock, King Kong, and Nacho Libre,
Jack Black is a movie star in his own right., Tenacious D had 
created the album they always wanted to make, so it was
time to tell the story Black and Gass had always wanted to 
tell: theirs. The two rockers do exactly that in their upcoming 
feature-length film: Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny.
More Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle than This is 
Spinal Tap, The Pick of Destiny once again retells the history 
of the band’s formation. Black flees his oppressive Christian 
upbringing in the Midwest for California, where he meets 
guitar virtuoso Gass. Gass offers to teach Black how to play 
guitar in exchange for what amounts to indentured servitude, 
and a band is bom. But when the duo hear of a magical guitar 
pick made from the tooth of the devil that grants the user 
supernatural shredding skills, they begin a quest to break into 
the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and steal the pick.
The movie is half musical comedy and half spaced-out road 
trip. At 90 minutes, the film stretches the limits of how much 
Jack Black one can take; however, there is enough inspired 
vulgarity here to make this one worth the price of admission.
I don’t dare spoil any of the best jokes, but I will say that there 
are some enjoyable cameos by Meat Loaf, Amy Poehler, Tim 
Robbins, and even Ronnie James Dio himself. Paul F. Tomkins 
(reprising his role from the shorts as the indifferent open-mic 
host) absolutely steals the show with the two best lines (again 
neither of which can be reprinted).
In sum, The Pick of Destiny is no Citizen Kane, but — let’s 
face'it — you didn’t strap on your Gibson Flying V, your torn 
leather pants, and your AC/DC T-shirt to go to the ballet,.did 
you? Tenacious D is in theaters now. Dress to rock out.

Cruise as a fighter pilot in his quest 
for redemption. Difficulties that come 
with the job threaten his ambitions to 
become an elite Navy pilot and force 
him repeatedly to look dramatically 
at Kelly McGillis and ask for her 
support. Simply put, the best 110-

Navy has ever made for the Air 
Force. Whether you’re into drama, 
Cold War dogfights, explosions, ’80s 
karaoke music, planes, Meg Ryan,

for you. All around good acting and 
a feel-good (eventually) storyline that

film. The plot still follows Dante

instead of clerking. Although 
with less memorable and less

Light-Up Night kicks off the holiday season

Light, downtown merchants, and the Building Owners and Managers Association, Light-Up Night would Th 
be impossible to pull off without the efforts of thousands of local volunteers. Every year, about 50,000 people 
up to enjoy Light-Up Night and all the exciting festivities it has to offer. Taking over Market Square, Wi 
PPG Plaza, and Station Square, it features myriad events, people, cultures, activities, music, shopping, cel 
and, of course, lights. Fie

The official fighting of the Christmas tree took place at 5:45 p.m. on Friday. Within hours, the streets ao 
of Market Square were crowded and bustling with people enjoying the food and eagerly awaiting the 
the fireworks display at 9 p.m. There were many students in the crowds of spectators. Stephanie toi 
Johnson, a chemistry major at Chatham College, strolled about with her friends, enjoying the sights, au 
"[Light-Up Night is] a nice night where the whole city comes together," she said. "It’s a great pie 
experience and a good way to get away from the hectic life of a college student. It’s awesome to pu 
come down and see all the lights and people and see how much fun everyone's having."

The most eye-catching event of all, the Gingerbread House Display and Competition, in its 
fourth year, graced the windows of PPG Place. Surprisingly enough, gingerbread was not the Li< 
only material, just as houses were not the only structures. Statues of Gumby look-alikes, by 
nativity scenes, lighthouses, and the White House were just some of the structures scattered all 
throughout the display. The gingerbread houses were judged in different categories, H< 
including Family, High School, and Non-Profit Child. PL

Despite having lived in Pittsburgh her entire life, Rupert had never been to Light-Up cc

The first-place winner in the middle school category was a re-creation of a is 
lighthouse and small cottage on the water, appropriately titled Christmas at the 
Beach. Created by Girl Scout Troop #807 from North Allegheny Middle School, 
the structure showcased an 18-inch lighthouse with “brick" made out of oyster 
crackers and licorice. It was placed adjacent to a quaint graham-cracker
with the traditional candy roof and porch and a cinnamon-stick fence.
Many of the other structures were also impressive. The windows boasted 
of re-creations of the Colosseum in Rome, Mellon Arena, Heinz Field, 
the Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and even a Wal-Mart. Girl 
Scout Troop #603 made a replica of the traditional green Girl Scout vest, 
surrounded by the words "Girl Scouts is about trying new things.” All 
of the gingerbread creations were for sale, with proceeds going to 
Children's Hospital’s Free Care Fund.
The night ended in a finale of fireworks over the Allegheny River. 
Visitors headed over to Macy’s to see the unveiling of the holiday 
windows, presented by Mayor Luke Ravenstahl. People could get a 
head start on Christmas shopping, do a little window shopping, or 
catch a quick show. Student performers from various high schools 
sang Christmas carols to throngs of spectators in the women's shoe 
department at Macy’s. Shortly after, a narrator read an abridged 
version of The Nutcracker, accompanied by music and a ballet 
ensemble. Restaurants in Market Square were open to the public, 
serving as places for food and warmth. Inside PPG Plaza, live bands 
played and various holiday trinkets and gifts were on sale.
In a month, the semester will be over and it will be time to kick back, 
relax, and enjoy some time off. For now, you can get your holiday fix by 
engaging in some of the holiday events going on in Pittsburgh. This 
weekend, downtown Pittsburgh, usually visited and acclaimed for 
its almost 400 year-round shops and eateries, was host to countless 
activities. Lights, fun, and food could be found anywhere and 
everywhere in celebration of the season.
Light-Up Night
On Friday, Pittsburgh ushered in the holidays with its 47th annual 
Light-Up Night downtown. A famous and well-loved Pittsburgh 
tradition, Light-Up Night is the official start of the holiday 
season. Presented by Macy’s (formerly Kaufmann's),

Fifth Avenue Place was also festive and inviting. Outside, student 
organizations from different high schools and universities sang • 
Christmas carols. Though there was no shopping, people still 
milled about inside Fifth Avenue Place, getting food, meeting 
Santa — and his giant reindeer — and taking in all of the 
sights and sounds.

January 5, the eve of the epiphany. La Befana, unlike traditional Santas of other countries, was 
female, dressed in magnificent blue robes, and carried a bell and cane. The exhibit.will remain in 
the PPG Wintergarden until January 7.
There’s also reason to head over to Phipps Conservatory. The Winter Flower Show brings a 
little color to the drab and dreary days of winter with bright, beautiful displays of poinsettias, 
azaleas, chrysanthemums, and more. The conservatory itself also features holiday displays and 
visits with Santa, as well as choirs and candlelight tours. After Thanksgiving, Phipps will have a 
three-day program in which visitors can have a breakfast prepared by some of the best caterers 
in Pittsburgh, attend a cooking demonstration with a celebrity chef, or just wander, looking at or 
purchasing any of the various crafts or greenery around.
For those who do not live near an ice rink such as the one in Schenley Park, it can be difficult to 
be able to enjoy ice skating, the age-old winter pastime. At the ice skating rink at PPG Place, 
opened on Light-Up Night, men, women, and children of all ages can whiz by the decorated 
Christmas tree in the center of the rink. Ice skating at PPG Place makes for a great way to wind 
down after work or school, hang out with friends, and bond with family, until its clothing after 
Christmas.
On Walnut Street in Shadyside, typical shopping will be transformed over Thanksgiving 
weekend into a fantasy of holiday cheer and shopping. Decorations will adorn lights and 
lampposts, brightening the streets. Various shops and restaurants will have special holiday 
treats for visitors. Street entertainment, carolers, and Santa Claus will frequent the streets until 
Christmas, lifting spirits and spreading cheer. Businesses will also be hosting a raffle in an effort 
to raise money for the Children’s Hospital's Free Care Fund.
With such a multitude of events going on, it is difficult to not be excited about the upcoming 
holidays. Pittsburgh’s mission has been accomplished: Boredom during the next few months 
has been completely abolished; there is an event or activity for nearly everyone. If all else fails, 
you can at least look forward to being with family and friends, and remembering the things that 
matter most.
i Thanksgiving events
iple
S| With Thanksgiving right around the corner, events are happening all over Pittsburgh in 
celebration of Turkey Day. Remember Clippership during Orientation? The Gateway Clipper 
Fleet will host a Thanksgiving ’80s dance party cruise with local band Ferris Bueller’s Revenge 
on Wednesday. In addition, it will also host a Thanksgiving Day dinner, prepared by a chef, 
accompanied by a live band, and accentuated by the view of the Pittsburgh skyline. Some of 
the Steelers will help out with a food drive at Dick’s Sporting Goods at the Mall at Robinson 
tomorrow. Visitors will be able to donate non-perishable food items, enter a raffle for an 
s. autographed football, and feel good about helping those in need. Various churches and other 
places of worship will also host their own Thanksgiving dinners along with services for the 
to public.
Holiday events around Pittsburgh
; Light-Up Night was merely the beginning. Many of the events are ongoing and can be enjoyed 
by the public until Christmas Day. A big favorite is the Dollar Bank Holley Trolley tour, which 
;ed allows you to get aboard a traditional-style trolley and take a tour of downtown, including the 
Hard Rock Café at Station Square, the Pittsburgh Cultural District, and the ice rink at PPG 
Place. Horse-drawn carriage rides in the city are also available. The best part of it all: Both are 
completely free.
[P.3 The PPG Wintergarden's “Spirits of Giving From Around the World” exhibit pays homage to 
3r Pittsburgh’s diverse cultures. The display featured a 32-foot Christmas tree with lights and 
miedecorations of different shapes and sizes. In addition, there are oil paintings and a showcase of 
ys. life-sized Santas representing 16 countries. Each Santa is dressed in the traditional attire of its 
Jp corresponding country, while a display book contains stories telling the origins and traditions 
:e of countries including Ukraine, Haiti, Italy, China, Poland, Germany, and Ireland. For example, 
the exhibit describes the Star Man, draped in deep crimson robes adorned with gold stars, who 
gave small gifts and cookies to children in Poland after Christmas Eve supper. Another example

Pixels and petals: ‘Ultra-Nature’ at the Wood Street Galleries
Exhibit combines technology and art to simulate Mother Nature
Carnegie Mellon prides itself on its outstanding programs in 
both computer science and visual art. But what if these two 
seemingly different subjects could somehow be combined? At 
the Wood Street Galleries in downtown Pittsburgh, “Ultra- 
Nature," a new exhibit by French artist Miguel Chevalier, uses 
mathematical equations and an aesthetic eye to do just that.
One enters the "RGB World" room to the haunting sound of 
a chorus of bass voices, their tone so constant and low that 
it immediately sets the mood for the futuristic exhibit. In an 
otherwise plain white room, three projectors display a virtual 
landscape of red, green, and blue. The landforms continuously 
move towards the viewer, as though one is a bird flying low 
over the computerized canyons, plateaus, lakes, and rivers. 
The landscape resembles that of the Grand Canyon or the 
Andes, but in actuality is entirely fake, created by Chevalier 
using algorithms and fractals.
Fractal art is characterized by the use of a relatively simple 
equation to create a very complicated, repeating structure. 
These equations have many different applications, including 
plant growth simulation and landscape generation, as 
evidenced in Chevalier’s work.
The second half of the exhibit is a virtual garden of multi­
colored plants against a tranquil blue background. 
Computerized flowers grow and blossom and periodically 
move with a virtual wind. Motion sensors allow visitors to 
interact with the exhibit — as they wave their arms, dance 
around, or even bounce up and down, the plants do the same. 
“[The flowers are] so pretty, really hypnotic," said Robin 
Schemes, a first-year art major at Carnegie Mellon. “It’s like a 
living jungle, really serene. Each flower has a life of its own.” 
In fact, each plant and its life cycle is unique, "defined by its 
morphogenetic characteristics,” according to the exhibit’s 
press release.
Sam Kennedy, a computer programmer, from Birmingham, 
Ala., said he particularly liked Chevalier’s work in its unique 
combination of science and art. “[Using the computer] there 
are unlimited ways you can express things.-This exhibit 
reflects a lot about the universe and how it is put together, 
how there are mathematical equations in the biological 
world.”
Chevalier, who studied at École Nationale Supérieure 
des Beaux-Arts in Paris and went on to École Nationale
Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, began focusing on computer 
art in 1992. He has since exhibited his work at the 1992 
Olympic Games in Barcelona, the Pompidou Center in Paris, 
Monterrey Museum in Mexico City, and many other venues 
around the world including Asia and South America.
The "Ultra-Nature” exhibit is an excellent example of how art 
can be used to connect and communicate some of the most 
fascinating and mysterious elements of our world. Chevalier's 
creation of an entirely unique botanic and geographical 
“planet" with the use of math and computers is something 
you won’t want to miss, whether you are a biology, computer 
science, or art major.
The “Ultra-Natuie" exhibit at the Wood Street Galleries is open 
until December 31. More information about the artist can be 
found at www.miguel-chevalier.com.
