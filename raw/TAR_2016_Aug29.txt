Group X classes now free for Carnegie Mellon students
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
In light of the opening of 
the new ?tness facility in the 
Cohon Center, the Carnegie 
Mellon University Depart-
ment of Athletics, Physical 
Education, and Recreation 
recently announced that as 
of Monday, Aug. 29, Group X 
classes, endorsed by The Task 
Force on the CMU experience, 
will be free to all undergradu-
ate and graduate students. 
This means that Carnegie 
Mellon University students 
can now partake in yoga, Pi-
lates, Zumba, indoor cycling, 
and other Group X classes free 
of charge. Due to the added 
space of the new ?tness fa-
cility, it was announced that 
the athletics department also 
plans to expand upcoming 
Group X schedules.
Group X classes were 
?rst inspired by the aerobics 
dance craze of the late 20th 
century, which was initiated 
by Kenneth H. Cooper, an ex-
ercise physiologist for the San 
Antonio Texas Air Force Hos-
pital. According to the Group 
X page on Carnegie Mellon 
University’s athletics web-
site, the ?rst ever aerobics 
class at the Carnegie Mellon 
was called “Dance and Gym-
nastics,” with both activities 
being separated into the fall 
and spring semester. As the 
popularity of aerobics grew 
on campus, so did the de-
mand for more classes and 
instructors.
“Over the years, the 
program grew and developed 
into Group Exercise, which 
is now called Group X,” 
the website states.
Making Group X classes 
free has been a work in prog-
ress for some time. Last year, 
the Athletics Department 
sponsored “Fitness Febru-
ary.” During this month, 
Group X classes were made 
free to undergraduate and 
graduate students. Addition-
ally, a partnership between 
Athletics, Housing Services, 
and Student Life provided 
free Group X classes dur-
ing the spring semester to 
residential students. The 
economic, physical, and ulti-
mately educational bene?ts 
of these programs led to an 
increase in popularity and de-
sire for free Group X classes 
year-round for students.
In the press release for 
the recently announced 
free Group X classes, Josh 
Centor, Director of Athlet-
ics at Carnegie Mellon, dis-
cusses the positive outcomes 
of these initiatives and what 
led to this decision. “We had 
great success with our initia-
tives last year,” said Centor. “I 
couldn’t be more excited that 
we are able to take this im-
portant step for our student 
community.” He hopes that 
the accessibility of these new 
classes will provide students 
the opportunity to be more 
healthy and active.
Group X classes used to be 
paid for through the Fitbucks 
payment system. Each Fit-
buck would cost one dollar 
and a Group X class cost ?ve 
Fitbucks. To pay for a Group X 
class, students were required 
to bring their Carnegie 
Mellon ID and tap their ID 
against a tablet to pay at the 
start of the session. This pro-
cess still remains; however, 
students can now take ad-
vantage of the classes by sim-
ply arriving at their desired 
class a few minutes prior to it 
starting and presenting their 
student ID to the instructor. 
This is a much quicker, sim-
pler, and more economically 
friendly alternative.
In the press release, Gina 
Casalegno, Vice president for 
Student Affairs, stated, “It is 
an exciting time to be at Carn-
egie Mellon with new invest-
ments being made in facilities 
and programs that support an 
enhanced CMU Experience.... 
I have been inspired to see 
the university’s commitment 
to holistic health and 
well-being come to life in 
our physical infrastructure 
through projects like the 
Cohon Center expansion and 
planned investments in the 
Tepper Quad and other build-
ing renovations. As we open 
the year with the impressive 
addition to the Cohon Cen-
ter, I am thrilled the univer-
sity is furthering the impact 
of our programs through the 
free Group X initiative for 
students.”
So far, reception to this 
news has been extremely 
positive among students.

Pitt student causes disturbance on Forbes Ave. 
DEBORAH CHU
Assistant News Editor
A 22-year-old University of 
Pittsburgh student, identi?ed as Grant 
Birdsong, who hails from the nearby 
Indiana Township, made waves on the 
internet last week when he attempted 
to leap from the rooftop of one build-
ing to another, but instead fell and got 
wedged between the two, all allegedly 
to impress a woman he just met. The 
two had gone up a ?re escape to the 
rooftops of the Qdoba and Bruegger’s 
Bagels restaurants in Oakland when 
the incident occurred. The area, on 
Forbes Avenue near Atwood Street, is 
relatively central to the University of 
Pittsburgh, but is also often visited by 
Carnegie Mellon students looking for 
nearby off-campus food options.
At approximately 2 a.m. Tuesday 
morning, rescue workers arrived on 
the scene to try to retrieve the student 
from the 17-inch gap between the 
buildings. Police, ?remen and para-
medics all contributed to the effort for 
about four hours before Birdsong was 
?nally freed at around 6 a.m. At one 
point, a paramedic rappelled down 
the gap, descending around three 
stories to help. Eventually, a jack 
hammer was used to break through 
the wall of Qdoba to successfully 
extract Birdsong.
The entire episode was 
live-tweeted by the Pittsburgh Public 
Safety Department, and was men-
tioned on several national news out-
lets. As Birdsong was wheeled away 
from the scene on a gurney, conscious 
but bleeding and sporting a broken 
ankle, he reportedly waved at TV 
news cameras.
A brief video of Birdsong after he 
was rescued shows him calmly laying 
on his back on a stretcher as he rolls 
towards an ambulance. He raises his 
arms in the air to give two thumbs up 
as he disappears into the vehicle.
On the internet, many who 
reported the story found humor in 
Birdsong’s ordeal. Time Magazine 
described it as “a harrowing tale of 
modern love, male ego, and park-
our” and commended the Pittsburgh 
Public Safety Department’s dedica-
tion to live reporting the incident 
on Twitter.
Vice Magazine had a list of 
questions for Birdsong, starting with 
“Are you OK?”, followed by questions 
such as, “What was the conversation 
like on top of the roof? Did you im-
mediately start bragging about your 
long-jumping ability, or did she start 
talking about her ex who was a really 
good jumper, or what exactly was the 
chain of events here?”, and ?nally 
ending with “Are you OK? I hope you 
are OK” again.
The roof-jumping incident even 
earned a mention in Jimmy Fallon’s 
monologue on The Tonight Show, as 
Fallon admitted he laughed when he 
heard the story, and joked that “After-
wards, the woman actually agreed to 
go out on a date…with the ?reman 
who rescued that idiot.”
On social media, Birdsong was 
dubbed “Pitt Spiderman” and earned 
his very own hashtag.
Following the incident, the owner 
of the Qdoba, Chad Brooks, com-
mented that his restaurant was likely 
to be closed for two weeks due to the 
new massive hole in its wall. How-
ever, Brooks stated that, “We were all 
young and dumb at some point, so no 
ill will toward him. I’m sure he’s em-
barrassed. I’m sure he’s hurting too.”
Bruegger’s Bagels was met with 
more fortune in the aftermath, ex-
periencing a delay of only an hour 
before opening again at 7 a.m. on 
Tuesday morning.
Police considered ?ling charges, 
but according to public safety spokes-
woman Emily Schaffer, the cost of 
the damage done was expected to be 
covered by the business’ insurance.
In the end, if it’s any consolation to 
Birdsong, the girl did end up staying 
through the whole ordeal to make 
sure he was okay. It is unknown, 
however, whether they kept in touch 
after that.

Lately, many drivers 
have been making the 
switch from gasoline pow-
ered cars to electric cars. 
Why? The main driving 
factor leading many Ameri-
cans to make this switch is 
the fact that electric cars 
provide bene?ts to today’s 
drivers that, for many, 
seem to outweigh the use of 
gasoline powered cars.
The major appeal of 
electric cars is the environ-
ment-friendly nature of 
the car, which swaps out 
the gasoline motor for an 
electric one, resulting in 
less pollution. This fact is 
especially great for those 
living in major cities where 
the effects of pollution from 
over-population pose an 
increasingly serious threat 
every day.
The appeal of electric 
cars has swayed many who 
no longer see the appeal 
of using gasoline and are 
starting to take notice of the 
negative aspects of it. Jason 
D’Antonio, director of the 
Health Profession program 
at the Mellon College of 
Science, commutes roughly 
30 miles to and from work 
every day and has noticed 
that the fuel consumption 
from his current car has 
become too high for him.

Cylab professors awarded $1.1 million, four-year NSF grant to continue their research on the Internet of Things
SARAH GUTEKUNST
Publisher
This summer, the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) 
awarded a $1.1 million, four-
year grant to a team of re-
searchers in Carnegie Mellon’s 
Cylab to solve the problem 
of security in the Internet of 
Things (IoT).
The grant recipient is Vyas 
Sekar, assistant professor in 
electrical computer engineer-
ing at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, who will work alongside 
professors Yuvraj Agarwal and 
Srinivasan Seshan from the 
School of Computer Science. 
The grant will primarily 
serve to pay the tuition and 
stipends of the faculty’s PhD 
students, whom Sekar deems 
“the absolute ‘lifeblood’ of the 
awesome research results you 
see here at CMU.”
The IoT describes the near-
ly six billion everyday devices 
that we use with network con-
nectivity to send and receive 
information. It integrates the 
real and digital worlds and 
comprises the devices that 
we call “smart.” We use these 
devices in our houses, cars, 
natural environments, and 
even when choosing out?ts, 
so, naturally, they run on 
an extremely wide variety 
of platforms.
Because of this diversity, 
the devices cannot be easily 
secured or regulated through 
software, like anti-virus pro-
grams. The best way to com-
bat this problem is through 
the network.
In a press release, Sekar 
said that the team will operate 
under the assumption that the 
devices are broken and cannot 
be ?xed, therefore the solu-
tion is to put a metaphorical 
“kevlar vest” around them to 
intercept any threats before 
they reach the device.
Despite its inherent 
brokenness, the IoT is worth 
the security. Sekar wrote in an 
email, “IoT promises to revolu-
tionize various aspects of ev-
eryday life and many market 
segments — introducing new 
opportunities to improve the 
ef?ciency of various process-
es, cut energy costs, improve 
quality of life and so on.” But 
we interact with these devices 
so closely and so often that 
they tend to interact with our 
private information. A more 
secure IoT will allow users to 
feel more con?dent that their 
privacy will not be violated.
The NSF grant awarded to 
Sekar and Cylab signi?es that 
this issue is worth the time, 
money, and research to the 
broader research community 
as well as to the average Amer-
ican. In order to be considered 
for a grant, researchers must 
submit a proposal to the NSF. 
The proposal is then sent 
through various phases of 
peer review. 
Panels of experts in the 
?eld evaluate all proposals 
to recommend which ones 
promise the most innovation 
and impact. Program manag-
ers then dole out grants to the 
top-rated researchers.
What makes Cylab’s  
approach to security unique 
among Carnegie Mellon’s 
peer institutions is the 
breadth of specialties and 
departments that its faculty 
represent. Each team member 
brings something essential to 
the project. According to Sek-
ar, security is “an inherently 
‘cross cutting’ activity that 
entails several disciplines and 
a collaborative research at-
titude,” which Cylab’s faculty 
is built to handle.
On the collaboration with 
Agarwal and Seshan, Sekar 
said, “we bring together com-
plementary expertise in dif-
ferent areas such as network 
security, software-de?ned 
networks, sensor networks, 
mobile systems, privacy, etc. 
that will be fundamentally 
necessary to address the IoT 
security and privacy research 
challenges.”
The gasoline free nature of 
electric cars is what appealed 
to him most. “I want to use lit-
tle to no gasoline for commut-
ing,” D’Antonio states. He also 
hopes that this aspect of elec-
tric cars will encourage others 
to make the switch as well.
The gasoline engine in 
regular cars is replaced with 
an electric motor in electric 
cars, which results in a nearly 
silent drive, another major ap-
peal of electric cars to drivers. 
The electric motor is powered 
by controllers which get their 
energy from rechargeable 
batteries. While both types of 
cars look similar on the out-
side, one way of spotting the 
difference is to note that gaso-
line powered vehicles can be 
seen hooked up to gas pumps 
while electric cars get their 
energy from a charging wire.
Previously, Carnegie 
Mellon University was home 
to the “Electric Garage” 
which, in addition to eight 
vehicle recharging stations, 
also provided a high-power 
wall connector for Tesla elec-
tric cars. The high-power 
wall connector at the Elec-
tric Garage was able to pro-
vide roughly 58 miles of 
range per hour of charge. 
Located on 4621 Forbes Av-
enue, the Electric Garage was 
made free to the public in 
the Oakland area.
On Aug. 5, the Electric 
Garage was closed down to 
make room for the construc-
tion of the new Tata Consul-
tancy Services (TCS) Build-
ing. As a result, the electric car 
charging stations have been 
relocated to nine locations on 
the Carnegie Mellon campus. 
Two are located on the ?rst 
level of the East Campus Ga-
rage, another two are located 
on the third level of the Dith-
ridge Street Garage, and ?ve 
are on the bottom level of the 
Robert Mehrabian Collabora-
tive Innovation Center (CIC) 
Garage. As of Aug. 20, any-
body using one of the three 
garages is able to use the 
charging stations.
While many people across 
the country have started to 
see the appeal of electric car 
use, the knowledge of this 
type of car, or rather the ap-
peal of it, has not yet persuad-
ed many in the Carnegie Mel-
lon community, which may 
have added to the decision to 
utilize the old location of the 
Electric Garage for the new 
TCS building. In an email, 
Michelle Porter, director of 
Parking and Transportation 
Services at Carnegie Mellon, 
states “There is a very small 
number of students/[facul-
ty]/staff utilizing the charges 
on campus.”
One could argue that while 
there are many real world 
incentives to using electric 
cars over gasoline cars, the 
lack of incentives for elec-
tric car use at Carnegie Mel-
lon University, paired with 
drivers’ questions about the 
practicality and affordabil-
ity of them, has not helped in 
promoting discussions about 
using this type of car.
Michelle Porter states 
that currently the univer-
sity “[does] not provide any 
incentives for electric car 
drivers.” D’Antonio certainly 
believes this is a part of the 
problem. He points out that 
there are no ?nancial bene?ts 
to using an e-car at Carnegie 
Mellon, such as, for example, 
a discount on parking electric 
cars. While there are no added 
incentives for using electric 
cars on campus, D’Antonio 
does note that one area elec-
tric cars do have an advantage 
is that while there are no gas 
stations around campus, elec-
tric cars are at least provided 
with a few charging stations 
for a couple hours of charge. 
This fact does not, however, 
make up for the lack of con-
versations about the useful-
ness of electric cars.
“As a university known for 
innovation and making ideas 
come to life, I would think that 
environmental awareness of 
this issue would be more front 
and center, and would perme-
ate conversations resulting 
in more efforts to promote 
fuel ef?ciency commuting,” 
D’Antonio states.
While electric car use has 
not been given much attention 
on campus, there has been 
a lot more focus on other 
methods of transportation 
such as Zipcars, motorcycles, 
and handicap accessible cars, 
which have far more spots on 
campus that electric cars. The 
drive to include and promote 
conversations about other 
methods of transportation at 
Carnegie Mellon is present, 
but sadly electric car use has 
not been as included in this 
movement.
It is still unclear as to 
whether or not Carnegie Mel-
lon University will take the 
initiative to promote more 
discussions around electric 
cars on campus. However, 
with the growing use of elec-
tric cars across the globe, 
one can hope that this will 
soon change.

The United States 
Department of Energy (DOE) 
Geothermal Technologies 
Of?ce partnered with the 
Center for Advanced Energy 
Studies (CAES) and Idaho 
National Laboratory (INL) 
earlier this spring to highlight 
the value and potential of 
geothermal energy. 
Together, they hosted a 
competition for high school 
and university students to 
create infographics.
There were over 100 teams 
comprising of two to three 
students that entered the 
competition, and a committee 
of engineers, energy experts, 
and creative professionals 
selected the winners.
This year, the grand prize 
winner for the Geothermal 
Design Challenge was In?nity 
Below, a team composed of 
Carnegie Mellon students. 
The students, Marisa Lu, 
Tiffany Lai and Susie Lee, are 
sophomores in the School of 
Design.
“I’ve always been inter-
ested in environmental issues 
and led the environmental 
club back in high school, as 
well as campaigning with 
Environment Maryland and 
the Maryland Public Interest 
Research Group on related 
policies,” Lu said in a univer-
sity press release. “When I 
heard about this competition, 
I jumped on the opportunity 
to combine my personal pas-
sions and past experiences.”
“Personally, I believe our 
infographic had an edge be-
cause we addressed all sorts 
of energy sources. This way, 
we showed the audience what 
the information we were giv-
ing was up against,” Lai said 
in an interview with The 
Tartan. 
Lee used this opportunity 
to spread the word about 
alternative energy sources.
“Nature provides us with 
so much energy, why do we 
have to keep using nonrenew-
able ones like fossil fuels?” 
Lee said in the press release. 
“Getting other people 
aware of the resources that 
surround us is one step closer 
to being not so dependent on 
sources that won’t be able to 
provide for much longer. En-
ergy is the provider for func-
tion in our society. Why not 
fuel it for something that 
is clean both ethically and 
environmentally?”
In an interview with The 
Tartan, Lu agreed with her 
teammate. 
“I think energy is a topic 
that needs to be commu-
nicated better because it is 
what enables us to have the 
lifestyles that we do, yet it’s 
something we never give 
a second thought to until 
there’s something wrong with 
it,” Lu said.
Their winning design was 
an infographic entitled, “Our 
Energy Future? A Down to 
Earth Solution,” with a land-
scape depicting energy from 
the sun to the core of the 
earth.
“As I understand it, energy 
plays a big role in how societ-
ies function, and subsequent-
ly in?uences what sort of long 
term relationship we have 
with our environment,” Lu 
said in an interview with The 
Tartan. “Geothermal energy 
has not only great potential 
to reshape that relationship, 
but also to positively impact 
our international policies and 
socioeconomic landscape.
“The ideal future energy 
landscape is one that has 
just as much breadth in posi-
tive impacts. An ideal future 
energy scape would be one 
that cultivates good envi-
ronmental stewardship,

Scientists identify Proxima b, an Earth-like planet 
Years of research have led 
an international team of scien-
tists to the discovery of Proxi-
ma b, a rocky exoplanet close 
to Earth. With instruments at 
the European Southern Obser-
vatory in Chile, the scientists 
studied the emission of light 
from Proxima Centauri, the 
closest star to the sun and the 
center of orbit for Proxima b. 
According to Guillem 
Anglada-Escudé, a co-author 
from Queen Mary University 
of London, observation of the 
changes in color in Proxima 
Centauri led to deductions 
about the distance of Proxima 
b from the star as well as the 
mass of the planet.
Located within the 
habitable zone of the star, 
Proxima b exhibits charac-
teristics that would make it 
hospitable for life, although 
no evidence exists to con?rm 
that the planet possesses an 
atmosphere or water. Although 
the planet is far from human 
reach, scientists are eager to 
study more about it and pos-
sibly unlock details about alien 
life along the way.
The ?ndings on the planet 
were published in Nature.

Ultrasound may help the brain recover after coma
As reported in the journal 
Brain Stimulations, research-
ers led by Martin Monti at 
University of California, Los 
Angeles found that a 25-year-
old man demonstrated sig-
ni?cant recovery from a 
coma after they treated him 
with a low-intensity focused 
ultrasound pulsation. 
This is the ?rst time this 
technique has been used to 
treat severe brain injury. 
The noninvasive technique 
involves sonic stimulation of 
the neurons located in the 
thalamus, the part of the brain 
that processes information 
and is often impaired after a 
coma. 
During the procedure a 
device that emitted energy was 
placed next to the patient’s 
head. After the treatment, the 
man showed improvements in 
his consciousness and speech. 
If replicated in future studies, 
the results of this technique 
could prove to be effective in 
helping patients recover from 
comas. 
The device could be made 
into a helmet that is both 
portable and low-cost.

Large storm sends elusive S waves across the Earth
In the Chugoku region 
of southern Japan seismolo-
gists have detected an S wave, 
a faint deep-Earth tremor, 
which was triggered by a 
severe distant storm in the 
Atlantic Ocean. 
Involved in the study was 
Kiwamu Nishida and Ryota 
Takagi, from the University of 
Tokyo and Tohoku University 
respectively. 
The researchers employed 
a network of seismic sensors 
to detect and sum the multiple 
faint signals collected, allow-
ing them to trace the S wave to 
its origin for the ?rst time.
Peter Bromirski of the 
University of California San 
Diego, who wrote commen-
tary in the issue of Science in 
which the research was pub-
lished, stated that the ability 
to detect S waves, in addition 
to the less elusive P waves, 
would allow for the location 
of new seismic sources in the 
middle of the Paci?c. 
In turn, geologists could 
use the waves to learn more 
about the innermost layers 
of the Earth, including its 
structure and composition.

Pokémon GO app dwindles recently in number of users
More than a month after its 
release by Niantic, Pokémon 
GO appears to be declining 
in popularity. Axiom Capital 
Management estimates that 
the number of daily active us-
ers of the game went from 45 
million to 30 million between 
mid-July and mid-August.
According to Craig 
Chapple, editor of mobile 
games trade publication Pock-
etGamer.Biz, the decline is to 
be expected in the aftermath 
of the initial hype over the 
game. Part of the decline may 
also be attributed to Niantic’s 
controversial removal of the 
“nearby” feature in the appli-
cation. With less users, con-
cern exists about the impacts 
on the social aspect of the 
game.
Regardless of whether 
users will stick to playing 
the game in the long run, 
Pokémon GO still remains a 
top-grossing application in 
most countries. 
In addition, the future 
release of the game in many 
more countries, including 
parts of Asia and Africa, may 
improve the usage statistics 
for the game.

Engineers create ?rst autonomous, entirely soft robot
Researchers at Harvard 
University led by Robert 
Wood and Jennifer A. Lewis 
have developed the ?rst ful-
ly autonomous, soft-bodied 
robot. It is called the octo-
bot, as it carries the shape of 
an octopus, a creature that 
moves powerfully without 
an internal skeleton and, 
hence, has been an inspi-
ration for the soft robotics 
?eld. The research ?ndings 
were published in the journal 
Nature.
Unlike previous soft-
bodied robots, the octobot 
contains no rigid parts, such 
as batteries, wires, or circuit 
boards. Instead, the move-
ment of the octobot is fueled 
by liquid hydrogen peroxide, 
which reacts with a platinum 
catalyst to produce gas. The 
gas then goes into the arms 
of the octobot and in?ates 
them. A micro?uidic logic 
circuit is used to control the 
amount of hydrogen peroxide 
that is turned into gas.
The simplicity, yet novelty, 
of the researcher’s approach 
has laid the foundation for 
more complex designs in the 
future.

Washington State permits killing of roaming wolf pack
After feeding on local 
livestock, an entire pack of 
endangered gray wolves are 
now authorized to be exter-
minated, according to a re-
cent statement issued by the 
Washington Department of 
Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). 
At least 11 of the wolves 
had been roaming in Pro-
fanity Peak in Ferry County, 
including six adults and five 
pups.
Earlier this month, two 
female wolves were shot af-
ter wildlife biologists found 
that they caused the death 
and injuries of five cows in 
a grazing area. As a result, 
the cow attacks temporar-
ily ceased. Since then, three 
more attacks by wolves has 
been reported, prompting 
the WDFW’s decision to take 
further action. Despite pro-
test from local conservation 
groups, the agency stated 
that in addition to its efforts 
to maintain the wolf popula-
tion, it also had a responsibil-
ity to protect livestock from 
repeated attacks from the 
wolves

If you own a smartphone, 
you’ve probably heard of the 
newest mobile game sweeping 
the nation — or at least kids 
ages ?ve to 35, and then some.
Pokémon GO is a free, 
downloadable, international 
app developed by Niantic Inc. 
that utilizes augmented real-
ity to populate a player’s sur-
roundings with Pokémon char-
acters from Nintendo’s popular 
games for users to catch.
Players interact directly 
with their smartphone screen 
using a Google Maps layout. 
They can level up by catching 
and evolving Pokémon, visit-
ing Pokéstops, and training 
and competing in Gyms, to 
name a few.
One of the game’s selling 
points has been encouraging 
its mobile players to go outside 
and walk around, allowing 
them to take advantage of the 
nice summer weather. 
An entire section of Poké-
mon GO’s website is dedicated 
to exploring. It states, “Get on 
your feet and step outside to 
?nd and catch wild Pokémon. 
Explore cities and towns where 
you live — and even around 
the globe — to capture as many 
Pokémon as you can. 
“As you walk through the 
real world, your smartphone 
will vibrate to let you know 
you’re near a Pokémon.”
Pokéstops, for example, are 
another way that the game 
connects a virtual player to 
reality. They can be located at 
interesting or signi?cant land-
marks around a player’s area 
such as monuments, historical 
markers, or even a park bench 
in Schenley.
Pokémon GO is bringing 
this type of augmented real-
ity interaction to a stage that 
some would argue hasn’t been 
approached on this scale be-
fore. With over 100 million 
downloads and millions of 
people playing the game at any 
one time, the game is bound to 
have real world consequences.
Jeffrey Bigham, associate 
professor of human-computer 
interaction at Carnegie Mellon 
University’s School of Com-
puter Science, is excited to see 
where this exposure to aug-
mented reality can take us. 
In a university press release, 
he said, “There’s so much more 
potential for augmented real-
ity than what Pokémon GO 
shows. But I think it’s just the 
beginning, hopefully, of what 
we’ll see.”
Games that use augmented 
reality like Pokémon GO could 
be used in education, business, 
and more. 
“One area that I’m really in-
terested in is how we can turn 
players of these sorts of games 
into sensors on the world,” 
Bigham said in the press re-
lease. “So that could help a lot 
of different people navigate 
the world more easily.”
Augmented reality can also 
enhance and amplify our own 
human capabilities. Although 
it sounds like something out 
of a science ?ction movie, aug-
mented reality could be used 
to help identify people in a 
room by displaying their name 
over their head. It could even 
Pokémon GO users encounter augmented reality on phone

Those of you with too much time 
on your hands may have found your-
self wondering from time to time: 
how does concrete work? 
We walk on it almost every day. 
It’s used for roads, walls, columns, 
and housing foundations, to name a 
few applications. But what is it made 
of?
A fellow by the name of Joseph 
Aspdin, an English cement manu-
facturer, patented the method for 
producing Portland cement, a major 
ingredient of concrete, in the year 
1824. 
But the history of concrete isn’t as 
concrete as you might imagine, since 
its origins date as far back as ancient 
Egypt and Rome and materials simi-
lar to concrete can be found in the 
pyramids and the Pantheon.
Aspdin’s method has changed 
little since the 1820s and continues 
to be used regularly throughout the 
world. 
Concrete is, both metaphorically 
and literally, a key ingredient in the 
foundation of modern day building 
infrastructure, valued for its high 
strength and ability to be formed 
into almost any shape. 
In fact, over two billion tons of 
cement are produced each year!
Concrete is generated via a chem-
ical hydration reaction between ce-
ment and water. It is important to 
note here that cement and concrete 
are not the same thing. 
Cement is composed of limestone 
and clay, which are heated together 
at 1450 degrees Celsius in order to 
induce a reaction generating calci-
um silicates:
CaCo3 + SiO2

creates thousands of new jobs, 
and revitalizes the economy while 
providing cheap, American grown 
energy that we can trust to be clean 
and available for many generations 
to come.”
The infographic starts with 
a percentage distribution of the 
current United States electricity 
generation sources. Geothermal 
energy is currently the least used 
energy source, at 0.4 percent, and 
coal is currently the most used 
energy source at 38.7 percent. 
The infographic moves to types 
of sources for electricity in the 
United States in 2050, claiming 
that geothermal won’t expand 
until technology makes it more 
cost effective upfront. 
The infographic then moves to 
the operation cost of geothermal 
versus other energy sources, stating 
that geothermal has stable prices 
because it doesn’t need foreign fuel 
to operate.
“I think something risky our 
team decided to do was incorpo-
rate information about other types 
of energy, so that our infographic 
wasn’t only focused on geother-
mal energy,” Lai said in the press 
release. 
“We wanted to be realistic. We 
depicted statistics about current 
energy sources and what their 
status would be in the future.”
“In the visual storytelling of 
our infographic, we all agreed that 
while we had separate/different 
info blurbs to emphasize, we need-
ed them to still be able to come 
together to form a bigger picture 
for both informational and visual 
coherence,” Lu told The Tartan. 
“From a selling point, we 
believed an infographic that forms 
one picture overall catches the 
viewers attention faster without 
turning them off with too much 
text. It’s what I believe set our in-
fographic apart; ours is easy to 
view and glean information from 
at varying distances. So even the 
uninterested, unengaged viewer, 
would be able to get something 
out of it because the information 
we provide doesn’t need text to be 
understood.”
The infographic ends with the 
claim, “With potential to make pos-
itive impact economically, socially, 
environmentally, and research rac-
ing to make Enhanced Geothermal 
Systems cost effective, where do 
you see our future?”
All three students credit the 
School of Design in helping prepare 
them for this competition.
“I am happy and grateful to have 
been able to contribute towards 
working to this ideal while being 
able to apply the skills learned in 
school,” Lu said in an interview 
with The Tartan. 
“It was quite nice to see a 
reminder of why I am incredibly 
grateful and happy to be a CMU de-
sign student,” Lu continued. “The 
competition experience involved 
everything I loved from reading 
up on the current energy climate 
to organizing the informational hi-
erarchy to having fun playing with 
the nuances in the color theme - 
the process I feel really re?ected 
the type of bigger picture design-
ing and process emphasized cur-
riculum CMU Design cultivates in 
students.”
“Winning this challenge made 
me proud to represent Carnegie 
Mellon Design,” Lai said in an in-
terview with The Tartan. “It also 
encouraged me to create or join 
more design challenges, because 
participating in this one was a fun 
and rewarding journey.”
The top three teams received 
a cash prize of $2500 each. Since 
Lu, Lai, and Lee won the grand 
prize, they will also receive a 
trip to the Geothermal Resource 
Council’s 40th Annual Meeting 
on Oct. 23-26  in  Sacramento, 
California to present their 
infographic.

In August of last year a team of 
researchers from New York, Argen-
tina, and Brazil published a proof 
of concept paper concluding that 
machine learning techniques that 
analyzed people’s speech patterns 
helped predict the onset of psycho-
sis. This idea has caught on with 
many other psychologists, includ-
ing NeuroLex Diagnostics CEO Jim 
Schwoebel, who is using the idea 
to develop a tool to help diagnose 
schizophrenia. A data-based ap-
proach is a necessary step in the 
future of psychology and psychiatry 
and can help the ?eld respond to its 
patients’ needs more ef?ciently and 
ef?ciently.
All the way back in 2006, 
researchers from West Virginia Uni-
versity published a paper conclud-
ing that psychiatric diagnoses were 
not reliable, meaning that the same 
symptoms could turn up different di-
agnoses with different patients and 
doctors. They attributed the unreli-
ability to the lack of standardization 
among psychiatrists and proposed 
a method of diagnostics. However, 
psychiatric care continues to be a 
highly individualized process with 
different doctors having different 
methods. If diagnoses mean differ-
ent things to different doctors, then 
a patient never gets help because 
their symptoms mean one thing to 
their psychiatrist and another thing 
to a psychopharmacologist, making 
communication and collaboration 
between their care providers im-
possible. This disconnect prevents 
patients from receiving treatment, 
and makes the medical intervention 
a waste of time and money. These 
problems are compounded by the 
high price, both in time and money, 
of psychiatric care, and the fact that 
many doctors are overloaded with 
to many patients stuck in the end-
less cycle of failed diagnosis.
A lack of consistency is a prob-
lem machine learning is particularly 
useful for. Humans are excellent at 
discerning patterns where there are 
none through their own creativity 
and biases, so it’s easy for psychia-
trists to get trapped in their own 
intuitions despite the evidence. Ma-
chines don’t have personal inclina-
tions and basis, and won’t weight 
data in any particular 
direction. Machine 
learning could 
help organize 
the huge 
amount of 
informa-
tion being 
thrown 
at a 
psychiatrist with each patient and 
would make headway into stan-
dardizing the process of diagnosis 
so treatment can be standardized 
and distributed well. Even if the 
?nal result is a machine learning 
algorithm just narrowing the ?eld 
to several disorders, the algorithm 
could save hours of time for psychia-
trists who might be overwhelmed 
with as many as ?fty patients rely-
ing on them for care or weeks of 
the wrong treatment for a person 
that the psychiatrist’s intuition was 
wrong about.
Like any algorithmically based 
approach to anything, though, the 
idea of machine learning in psychi-
atric diagnostics is ruf?ing a few 
feathers.
The Atlantic feature on 
Schwoebel mentions two potential 
issues they have with his program. 
The ?rst is that the arti?cial intel-
ligence may not be able to pick up 
on cultural or personal differences. 
The second is a version of the ?rst, 
saying that the ?ndings of the algo-
rithm will be biased towards par-
ticular demographic groups based 
on who is available for training the 
algorithm.
These problems could also be 
exacerbated because the stigma on 
mental health issues is stronger in 
some cultures than others. How-
ever, this is a reason that it might 
be dif?cult for a machine learning 
approach to be perfect, not a reason 
to abandon it. The algorithm has to 
be trained on as many people and as 
many segments of the population as 
it can. The process of picking up on 
a cultural speech pattern or accent is 
just using data — a person’s accent 
or vernacular compared to their 
overall speech pattern — to reach a 
conclusion about whether this per-
son is or is not likely to have a cer-
tain mental disorder. That is exactly 
what data-based processes do.
While psychiatry as a whole 
needs to be modernized and take 
advantage of many new approaches 
beyond just this one, the re?ex to 
apply machine learning and other 
data-based techniques is the right 
one. The early returns say speech 
patterns are useful in some cases 
and if proof-of-concept papers come 
out supporting many symptoms de-
tected by this technology, it can be 
a really powerful tool even if it is 
outstripped by more speci?c tests. 
It requires continued interaction be-
tween psychiatrists and patients, so 
that information is recorded and re-
mains cheap and easy to get. If 
it turns out to be 
a versatile tool 
that is useful 
in diagnosing 
many mental 
disorders, 
it can help 
narrow 
down the 
more speci?c tests 
someone might need 
or improve the accuracy 
of those tests by giving a 
doctor something more spe-
ci?c to look for.
People with mental health 
problems ?oat through a vacu-
ous network of aimless ques-
tion and answer sessions that 
lead to guesses as to what might 
be causing their distress. These 
machine learning techniques can 
add structure and goals to that pro-
cess and help get results for people 
who really need them.

The National Labor Relations 
Board (NLRB) has recently reversed 
its previous decision denying grant-
ed graduate students the right to 
unionize and giving them the rights 
of employees. 
Their decision comes in the wake 
of a petition ?led at Columbia Uni-
versity. The ruling was 3-1 in favor 
of graduate students having the 
right to collective bargaining. With 
all the work that seems to be done 
by graduate students, it seems to be 
the obvious response to allow them 
to behave as actual employees, but 
for the NLRB this decision has been 
anything but simple. One of the 
main reasons for initially not giv-
ing graduate students the ability to 
unionize was the “primary purpose” 
or “primary relationship” ideology. 
First applied to Adelphi University in 
1972, this is the idea that graduate 
students’ primary purpose on cam-
pus is to learn and that jobs such as 
teaching and working as a research 
assistant facilitate this. This decision 
was notably overturned in 2000 and 
then, in 2004, the NLRB returned 
back to the “primary purpose” 
justi?cation.
The NLRB has maintained the 
idea that graduate students are not 
protected under the National Labor 
Relations Act (NLRA), only waver-
ing from this opinion between 2000 
and 2004. The NLRA is an act that 
protects the rights of employees to 
unionize, participate in collective 
bargaining, and go on strike. This 
act initially did not cover any em-
ployees of private universities, but 
this changed in 1970 when the NLRB 
decided that differentiating between 
commercial and noncommercial 
activity was not necessary. This is 
when the NLRB decided that private 
universities would be included in 
this jurisdiction. 
The distinction between what is 
being done by graduate students for 
educational purposes and what is 
being done for commercial purposes 
seems to often be what causes the 
NLRB to go back on its decisions.
While graduate students are on 
campus to learn, they end up being 
so much more than just students 
while they are on campus, with not 
all of their tasks being essential to 
their learning.
As teaching assistants, they are 
often teaching introductory level 
material in their ?eld. They’re left 
with the task of going into detail and 
further explaining the material in 
ways that the professor often does 
not have time to do in lecture. With 
lectures being so large, it is the time 
during recitations with teaching as-
sistants that really makes the differ-
ence for most students. 
This experience can be useful for 
graduate students, but they are usu-
ally teaching information that they 
already have a pretty comprehensive 
knowledge of. The idea that they are 
furthering their education through 
this process does not really hold up 
well. They are teaching recitations 
for the bene?t of undergraduate stu-
dents, not necessarily for themselves.
In addition to playing a pivotal 
role in the education process for 
undergraduate students, graduate 
students also play an important role 
in the development of research at 
universities. While this is something 
that graduate students can bene?t 
from educationally, it is also some-
thing the world can bene?t from. So 
many ideas for products start as an 
idea between a graduate student and 
a professor in a research lab. For this, 
graduate students deserve to be able 
to protect their rights as employees. 
Graduate school is not easy to afford, 
and for all the work that they do in 
addition to their classes, they de-
serve to be able to negotiate their 
salaries.
The indecisiveness of the NLRB 
is not only giving everyone whip-
lash, but it’s also unfair to graduate 
students who are unable to negoti-
ate their rights when these students 
play such an important role in under-
graduate universities. Their rights 
are often ignored with much of the 
focus at many universities being 
placed on undergraduate students. 
Graduate students are the silent he-
roes that keep universities thriving. 
Even at schools like Carnegie Mellon 
that have roughly the same number 
of graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents, they can be a separate entity 
that is often not heard by undergrad-
uates outside of recitation. They de-
serve to have a collective voice, and 
that voice often gets drowned out 
amid the voices of professors and 
undergraduate students.
Graduate students have been 
treated as second-class citizens by 
the NLRB. They are students, but 
the work that they do whether it 
is for educational gain or ?nancial 
incentives keep universities thriv-
ing and allow them to continue to 
receive grants to fund research. 
Research has shown that the ability 
to unionize will not harm faculty-
student relationships, so there is 
no incentive for the NLRB to con-
tinually deny graduate students 
the same rights as other employees. 
This should be the NLRB’s last deci-
sion regarding the matter. It’s hard 
to believe that graduate students 
have only been given four years of 
the recognition that they deserve. 
Hopefully, this time, it will be a 
decision that sticks.

Mental health diagnostic schema in dire need of reform
THEODORE TEICHMAN
Photo Editor
For the past 60 years, there has 
been a harsh disconnect between 
the ?elds of brain research and brain 
treatment, and it is a disconnect that 
deeply impacts the quality, access, 
culture, and ef?cacy of mental health 
care today. While we have a plethora 
of new treatment options for mental 
illnesses, the primary issue that cre-
ates a bottleneck in treatment is in 
the diagnosis and treatment plan-
ning procedures.
The current mainstream of mental 
health diagnosis relies on the DSM-5: 
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders edition 5. The 
DSM-5 creates de?nitions of mental 
illnesses that lump together people 
that have vastly different root causes, 
manifestations, and treatment re-
sponses together under a single cat-
egory and often leaves people that 
don’t ?t enough core criteria of a 
single de?nition but are not mentally 
healthy out in the cold. This system is 
predominantly based on the external 
symptoms and traits a physician or 
patient notice during a visit. This is 
called a taxonomic classi?cation. 
Unfortunately, this system is lim-
ited in its ability to actually describe 
what is going on beneath the surface, 
something that is crucial if we are 
to reach a point where we can have 
highly speci?c and effective treat-
ments for mental illnesses, rather 
than putting patients into generic 
categories, prescribing treatments, 
and ?nding out if they work only by 
trial and error.
Compounded, these issues mean 
that receiving a diagnosis as de?ned 
by the DSM-5 does little to actually 
suggest a method of treatment for the 
issue other than an archaic system of 
trial-and-error that has long since 
been abandoned as the ?rst line of 
defense in most other areas of medi-
cal science. 
For example, a symptom of anxiety 
can represent an endocrine disorder, 
a psychotic process, a drug response, 
or a currently recognized anxiety dis-
order, and each of these has a differ-
ent treatment protocol, not including 
the variety of treatment protocols for 
the psychologically-based anxiety 
disorders. 
The result is that patients have to 
go through rounds of medical tests 
and screenings in a process of elimi-
nation that eventually dumps them 
in the category of anxiety disorder if 
no other explanation turns up. In this 
way, anxiety disorder turns into a 
catch-all for problems we don’t have 
medical tests for instead of a speci?c 
diagnosis with a clear treatment pro-
tocol like a patient would receive if 
they were diagnosed with pancreatic 
cancer or kidney disease.
What is necessary for the ad-
vancement of mental health care for 
the future is for the ?eld of psychiatry 
to catch up to the advances in ?elds 
such as neuropsychology, molecular 
genetics, and neurobiochemistry. 
The present search for biomarkers, 
genetic predictors, or neuroimage 
markers for our existing system of 
mental illness categories is doomed 
to fail. These suffer at the same im-
passes as the rest of the DSM-5 di-
agnoses. With the overlap between 
different mental illness de?nitions 
and the extreme variety within 
each single de?nition, these DSM-5 
categories are often not biologically 
discernible. What needs to change is 
how we classify mental illnesses. 
We need a system that classi?es 
along a multidimensional matrix that 
accounts for all the ways a mental 
health disorders can manifest, from 
the genomic and molecular level to 
the way they take shape in emotions 
and social interactions. This is exact-
ly what the Research Domain Criteria 
Initiative (RDoC) by the National In-
stitute of Health is attempting to do.
Instead of viewing mental illness-
es as collections of symptoms for a 
diagnostic label for ease of communi-
cation, the RDoC looks at the brain as 
a system of multiple different, inter-
related but discernibly neural circuits 
that can be evaluated not only on 
self-reported or physician observed 
symptoms, like in our current system, 
but also described through variance 
in speci?c neuroimaging patterns, 
behavioral-cognitive tasks, and bio-
marker tests. The best part is that we 
have a substantial amount of data 
already available about these bio-
markers and neuroimaging patterns; 
researchers have simply been try-
ing to interpret them in the current 
taxonomic structure that invalidated 
these smaller subpopulations. 
Through this system, research-
ers hope to eventually reach a point 
where the health care provider does 
not simply issue a diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia, but instead is able to locate 
which speci?c neurotransmitter and 
receptors are speci?cally malfunc-
tioning and in which part of the 
brain, allowing them to issue a spe-
ci?cally tailored treatment for that 
patient’s condition. The RDoC will al-
low healthcare providers to see what 
is wrong in the patient’s brain, not 
simply how it manifests.
With this new matrix of different 
core elements, the primary diagnos-
tic tool will be based on biomarkers, 
neuroimaging strategies, patient-
reported data, cognitive-behavioral 
task, and observed behavior all taken 
into consideration. The differences 
along each of these domains will re-
late to a speci?cally discernibly neu-
ral circuit difference and treatment 
procedure. 
What will be required to improve 
treatment ef?cacy is a complete over-
haul of the current system of clas-
sifying, diagnosing, and describing 
mental illnesses themselves. Until 
this revision occurs, mental health 
care will continue to misdiagnose ill-
nesses and operate a non-targeted, 
trial-by-error method of treatment 
protocols, which in turn will jeopar-
dize time, resources, and the well-
being of patients all across the board.
Climate change changes landscape, threatens ?ood of climate refugeesBeware common myth of College Experience
SYDNEY ROSLIN
Shishmaref, Alaska, is a village 
with a population of approximately 
600, an Inupiat community on the 
small barrier island of Sarichef, 
north of the Bering Strait. The vil-
lage is rather unassuming, with a 
single school, three main roads, a 
church, a post of?ce, a few stores, 
and a collection of small houses. Yet 
this small, unassuming village is run-
ning out of space on their island, not 
because of human expansion, but 
instead because of the erosion of 
Sarichef island, erosion that 
is being attributed to cli-
mate change.
This is a prob-
lem that has 
plagued Shish-
maref for 
decades — 
since 
1969, more than 200 feet of shore 
has been eaten away from Sarichef 
island, according to a study pub-
lished in February. Storm surges and 
?ooding have caused loss of build-
ings and infrastructure, and of?cials 
have spent large amounts of time 
and money trying to save the island, 
totaling over $27 million dollars  on 
coastal protection measures from 
2005-2009.
Last week, in the unof?cial results 
of an election, the people of Shish-
maref voted 89 to 78 to relocate their 
town, electing to move to one of two 
sites on the mainland. They join the 
list of aptly named “climate refu-
gees,” people who are being forced 
to relocate their homes and lives due 
to rising sea levels and storm surges 
caused by global warming.
Rising sea levels and extreme 
weather patterns are two of the 
most visible examples of the ef-
fects that global warming has had 
on the environment. As global tem-
peratures rise, polar ice caps begin 
to melt, adding water to the Earth’s 
oceans. Sea water also expands as it 
warms, further contributing to the 
rising sea levels. Furthermore, as 
the air warms, it is able to hold more 
moisture, leading to heavier rainfall 
events that lead to further ?ooding 
and more extreme storms. The ef-
fects of these changes can be seen 
worldwide, and it is predicted that 
by the year 2050, as many as 200 
million people could be displaced 
due to climate change.
It is easy to look at environmen-
tal issues such as air pollution, wa-
ter pollution, and deforestation and 
see the extent of the negative im-
pact that humans have had on our 
environment. 
It is much harder to imagine 
our effect on something as massive 
as the oceans, or on something as 
seemingly permanent as the land. 
After all, we can watch slash and 
burn farming, we can see sewage be 
dumped into a water source, and we 
can understand a direct cause be-
hind a very visible problem.
However, it is dif?cult to instill 
fear with a few extra inches of sea-
water. The rising sea levels are prob-
lems that are hard to witness before 
it is too late. 
It is often not until a major storm 
breaks, or until the ?ooding gets bad 
enough to make an area uninhabit-
able, that we realize a problem ex-
isted. However, there is evidence 
all around us. There is Isle de Jean 
Charles, a Louisiana island that was 
granted $48 million dollars in Janu-
ary to relocate its residents to safer 
ground after the island experienced 
?ooding, saltwater intrusion, and 
shoreline erosion that has made the 
island uninhabitable. There is Shish-
maresh, whose island home has been 
whittled down to an island a quarter 
of a mile wide and two miles long.
These problems are not some 
distant threat, they are staring us 
down in the face. They are problems 
that are making themselves visible 
more and more each year, accumu-
lating years of chipping away at 
shorelines until it is seen 
in the disappearance 
of land, property, 
and commu-
nity. Yes, 
today it 
might 
be an 
island in Alaska or an island in Loui-
siana with a population smaller than 
a suburban high school, but tomor-
row it is the coast of Florida, it is New 
Orleans, it is the more than 1,000 
American towns that are threatened 
by rising sea levels.
Luckily, for Shishmaref and for 
Isle de Jean Charles, relocation is 
an option especially suited for small 
populations. But what happens 
when the displacement doesn’t af-
fect a few hundred people, but in-
stead affects 200 million? Will we 
be able to handle it? It is time to take 
action now, to plan now, to look for 
solutions now, because if we wait for 
the problem to show itself, it will be 
much too late.

When you go to college it seems 
like every person you encounter 
has some trite piece of advice to of-
fer you, like “these will be the best 
years of your life” or “make sure you 
get involved.” My favorite, though, 
is when people talk about “The Col-
lege Experience.” What does that 
phrase even mean? It’s something 
frequently cited, and it is treated 
as this American Dream-esque goal 
that, once you ?nd it, will grant 
you perfect happiness and ful?ll-
ment throughout your college years. 
An experience shared by students 
across America breeding stories to 
tell younger generations about “the 
best years of your life.” The whole 
concept of “The College Experience” 
is ?awed from the start, beginning 
with the fact that there is not one 
singular way to achieve success and 
happiness in one’s college years. Ev-
ery person ?nds his or her own way, 
a path that is different from every 
other student’s who has crossed a 
campus. There is also fault in call-
ing one’s time in college “the best 
years of your life,” as if once college 
is over it’s all downhill from there. 
There will be some great moments 
in college and some terrible ones. 
Moments of complete bliss and of 
utter devastation, just like every 
other time in one’s life. To imply that 
college is a perfect four years of joy, 
is misleading and disappointing for 
every student who will ?nd it to be 
otherwise.
For most students just starting 
at Carnegie Mellon, this is the ?rst 
time that have been thrown together 
with students just as smart, just as 
motivated, and just as talented as 
they are. The students here are in-
credibly passionate about what they 
do and it easy to feel overwhelmed, 
overlooked, and left feeling like you 
some how are not “good enough” 
to be here. There is a lot of pres-
sure on this campus to do more and 
to be more. People want to know 
what you will be doing in the fu-
ture, how many units you are taking 
now, and how many activities you 
are involved in, and will tell you on 
the next breath how they are doing 
more.
The stress culture that exists at 
Carnegie Mellon is not something 
to be dismissed. Students will brag 
about how many units they are tak-
ing, how little sleep they get at night, 
and how their day is so packed they 
don’t even have time to eat, as if 
starving yourself and depriving 
yourself of sleep is a sure pathway 
to success. It is something that is 
so easy to get swept up in. It is easy 
to fall into the trap of overworking 
yourself when you are surrounded 
by people who are doing the same. 
You have to take care of yourself. 
You cannot succeed in anything if 
you do not ?rst make time to make 
sure that you are healthy; mentally, 
physically, and emotionally. Don’t 
be afraid to admit to yourself that 
you may need to take a step back or 
that you need help.
It’s okay to feel lost and scared 
going off to college; it’s an enormous 
change in anyone’s life. You need to 
be true to yourself and take care of 
yourself. You cannot help yourself 
if you don’t know yourself. Allow 
yourself to be vulnerable, honest, 
and open to the world. It’s scary, 
especially because before coming 
to college most students have lived 
in this world they have known since 
childhood, surrounded by people 
who know one version of them, 
which may or may not be the truest 
version of themselves. It is terrifying 
to bear your soul and show the tru-
est version of yourself to the world, 
but it is the only way for you to dis-
cover the person you really are.
After completing your freshman 
year, you will not have erased ev-
ery remnant of yourself and be this 
new person who is unrecognizable 
from your former self in every way, 
yet it cannot be denied that college 
changes you. Those changes come 
through self discovery. They do not 
come from throwing away every-
thing that has made you you up to 
this point, but from embracing the 
true version of yourself and allowing 
yourself to grow into that person.
Don’t be disillusioned into believ-
ing that there is some formula for 
how to go through college. There is 
some truth that exists in clichéd ad-
vice people will give you — after all, 
they are clichés for a reason — but in 
the end “The College Experience” is 
not some stock term that can be ap-
plied to any student; it is not a crazy 
fun time the whole way through, nor 
is it four years of homesickness and 
loneliness. 
College is simply a new chap-
ter in your life that will have some 
good times and some bad. For most 
students it is their ?rst time living 
alone, the opportunity to live as an 
independent adult. It is an adven-
ture; be open to the journey.

Riot Games scolded for poor decisions in esports league
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
Over the last week, the 
community of the largest es-
port in the world, League of 
Legends, became angry after 
a series of events culminating 
in a public relations disaster 
for the developer of the game, 
Riot Games. The calamity 
started after an interview by 
thescoreesports.com with a 
professional player, Yiliang 
“Doublelift” Peng, in which 
Doublelift discussed the cur-
rent problems with the way 
Riot Games is handling its 
competitive scene. Namely, 
Doublelift criticized the de-
veloper for releasing large up-
dates, also known as patches, 
immediately before large pro-
fessional tournaments. These 
large updates can have drastic 
effects on play at the profes-
sional level, and forces teams 
to adapt to an entirely new 
style of play that best ?ts the 
current update. The best style 
of play ?uctuates with each 
patch and is referred to as the 
“meta.” A large, game chang-
ing patch right before a large 
professional event is similar to 
change the rules of a sport like 
soccer right before the world 
cup. The problem with this in 
League of Legends is that the 
meta of a new patch may favor 
a team that was weak in the 
previous meta, and vice-versa. 
This can, and has, changed 
the entire landscape of tour-
naments and the players are 
not happy about the timing. 
Most players in the commu-
nity agree that some level of 
change is healthy, but the gen-
eral rules of the game should 
stay the same when important 
professional tournaments are 
played. 
Doublelift’s short interview 
gained traction in the online 
community, and more well-
known people in the esports 
world began to speak on the 
same issue. Christopher “Mon-
teCristo” Mykles, a popular 
League of Legends caster for 
South Korean network OGN, 
spoke in more depth about the 
issue of patch timing as well as 
Riot Games’ failure to offer in-
dustry standard rates to free-
lance caster for international 
events. 
In the midst of all this criti-
cism, Riot Games co-owner 
and co-founder Marc Merrill, 
took some time out of his day 
to respond to a post on red-
dit.com discussing these is-
sues. In his post, he criticized 
Andy “Reginald” Dinh, one 
of the most important ?gures 
for the development of es-
ports and owner of one of the 
most successful esports teams, 
Team SoloMid, for not paying 
his players enough, and “los-
ing money on other esports.” 
This statement, among a slew 
of other blatant fallacies trig-
gered a massive angry re-
sponse from important mem-
bers of the community, and for 
good reason. 
Perhaps the most concern-
ing issue is the sti?ing of spon-
sors by Riot Games in their plot 
to control every single detail of 
the League of Legends esports 
scene. Multiple big names 
in the community spoke out 
about Riot Games’ unwilling-
ness to allow teams to share 
revenue from sponsors, which 
is a major source of income 
for teams in all other esports 
games as well as professional 
sports. The National Hockey 
League would not exist if rev-
enue sharing from sponsors 
did not exist. The community 
was eventually informed that 
League of Legends is, in fact, 
the least pro?table of the ma-
jor esports games for this very 
reason. 
Although he edited his 
posts and retracted some of 
his statements, the damage 
was done and the community 
was bearing their fangs at 
him. Some of the most in?u-
ential people in esports called 
him out for his own misunder-
standing of the industry, and 
rightly so. Some were calling 
for player unions to be cre-
ated, and drastic change will 
be needed to repair this hole 
in the trust of the community. 
Not only that, but the longev-
ity of Merrill’s game is at stake 
as well. League of Legends is 
already one of the longest last-
ing esports in history, next to 
StarCraft: Brood War. 
Every game has a life span, 
and it is up to Riot Games to 
preserve their game for the 
future. If they continue to 
communicate poorly with the 
community and make unfa-
vorable decisions for players, 
the game will not last. 
Riot Games can choose to 
extend their games longevity 
by appealing to their players. 
The community of League of 
Legends is larger than ever, 
and it will take a considerable 
amount of time for the game 
to fade away.

Tartan football and soccer teams begin the 2016 season
ALEX WOOD
Spots Editor
This Saturday Sept. 3, the 
Carnegie Mellon football team 
will take on the Bears of the 
University of Washington at 
St. Louis. The last time these 
rival teams met was almost a 
full year ago. The Tartans did 
not fare well in that contest, 
losing 45–24.
 The Tartans would lose 
two of their next three games 
after that before going on a 
seven game win streak to close 
out the season. 
The Tartans transformed 
in the weeks after playing 
Washington University, put-
ting up record-breaking offen-
sive numbers with the help of 
star junior running back Sam 
Benger. With that in mind, the 
Tartans are expected to beat 
the Bears in the ?rst competi-
tion of the year. With a large 
group of returning players on 
the ?eld for the Tartans, the 
veteran experience coupled 
with the chemistry built in 
last season’s win streak could 
carry the Tartans to another 
record-breaking season. 
While the Tartans ?nished 
last season on a strong note, 
they will be looking to improve 
on their success and eventu-
ally get into the NCAA tour-
nament to play for a national 
championship. Saturday will 
be their ?rst test of many.
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team will take on Musk-
ingum University at home on 
Thursday, Sept. 1. If last year’s 
meeting between these two 
teams is any indication of how 
this year’s match will go, then 
the Tartans are expected to 
win handily. These teams met 
last year on the exact same 
day, and the Tartans dominat-
ed Muskingum by a score line 
of 8–0. 
The Tartans did not end 
last season on a high note af-
ter losing their ?nal two com-
petitions, but after an offsea-
son of hard practice they are 
surely hungry to get back on 
a roll. Muskingum should be 
a nice warm up game for the 
Tartan men, allowing them to 
?ex their muscles and go into 
the season with an aura of 
con?dence about them. They 
should not get complacent 
however, because Muskingum 
will still show up to play and 
cannot be underestimated. 
If the Tartans just play their 
game calm and controlled, 
they should win easily.
Carnegie Mellon’s women’s 
soccer team will take on Fran-
ciscan University at home on 
Friday, Sept. 2 at 7 p.m. This 
is an interesting matchup 
because these teams did not 
meet at all last season, so it’s 
really anyone’s game. 
The Tartan women ?n-
ished last season with an as-
tounding 17–2–1 record, so 
they are not used to losing. 
That said, their season was 
cut short in the third round 
of the NCAA tournament in a 
heartbreaking overtime loss to 
Calvin, 1–0. That left the Tar-
tan women with a bad taste 
in their mouth, and they’ll be 
looking to cleanse their pal-
ette in the ?rst match of the 
season against a brand new 
opponent. 
The women of Franciscan 
University ?nished last sea-
son with a 6–8–2 record, so 
they can only improve on last 
season. If the Tartan women 
perform anywhere close to the 
level they did last season, they 
should handily beat the Bar-
ons of Franciscan University 
and begin the 2016 season on 
a high note.
Tartans partner with ESPN to broadcast home games
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
On Aug. 22, the Carnegie 
Mellon athletics department 
announced a partnership 
with ESPNWilliamsport.com 
to broadcast the home compe-
titions of the Tartan football 
team, as well as the men’s and 
women’s basketball teams.
ESPN Williamsport is the 
primary station and online 
platform for multiple profes-
sional sports teams, as well as 
numerous NCAA colleges and 
universities in four states.
ESPN Williamsport owner 
and general manager Todd 
Bartley noted, “The presti-
gious name of Carnegie Mel-
lon University was enough 
to get my attention when 
the opportunity to serve 
Tartans athletics presented 
itself.” The recent success 
of Carnegie Mellon’s sports 
teams was also surely a factor 
in the formation of this new 
partnership.
Carnegie Mellon director 
of Athletics Josh Centor has 
high hopes for this partner-
ship, and said, “We expect 
that this collaboration will 
allow us to share our student-
athletes’ achievements with a 
broader cross-section of the 
Carnegie Mellon community.”
Bartley announced that 
coverage will begin on Sept. 
3, as the Tartan football team 
takes on the Washington Uni-
versity of St. Louis in Gesling 
Stadium. 
Brian Collins will an-
nounce the game for ESPN 
Williamsport. On the op-
portunity to call the games 
for the Tartans, Collins said, 
“Just the absolute tradition 
of this prestigious school and 
the rich history has me ex-
cited and privileged to be a 
part of it this fall.” Collins has 
casted for multiple sports at 
every level of collegiate play, 
and has more than 20 years of 
experience. Collins also has 
multiple coaching accolades 
along with his experience in 
broadcasting, and can use 
his experience to improve the 
broadcast team for the bene?t 
of the viewers. This partner-
ship can also bene?t the Tar-
tan sports teams, giving them 
public exposure and allowing 
for the growth of the Tartan 
brand. Not only that, but fans 
of Carnegie Mellon’s sports 
teams will be able to watch 
these competitions from any-
where in the world.
The Carnegie Mellon web-
casts will use the audio feed 
from ESPNWilliamsport.com, 
and an audio only stream 
will also be available through 
ESPNWilliamsport.com and

Olympic athletes earn cash prizes based on countries
PAULINE TING
Assistant Online Editor
As the Summer Rio Olym-
pics ends, a number of su-
perstars have come out with 
more than a handful of med-
als: Michael Phelps, Katie 
Ledecky, Simone Biles, and 
Usain Bolt to name a few. Af-
ter years of rigorous training, 
endless sacri?ces, and often 
multiple injuries, attending 
the Olympics is the measure 
of ultimate success; winning a 
medal is the icing on the cake. 
However, not all prizes are 
created equal.
Besides fame and an Olym-
pic medallion, Olympic med-
alists can also win cash prizes 
from their country’s National 
Olympic Committee. In the 
United States, gold medalists 
will earn $25,000, silver med-
alists $15,000 and bronze 
medalists $10,000. The Unit-
ed States Olympic Committee 
gave out $1.8 million in cash 
prizes for the 105 medals won 
by American athletes.
However, these cash prizes 
are taxed by the United States 
government based on the ath-
lete’s income bracket. Simone 
Biles, who won 4 gold and a 
bronze medal will have to pay 
$43,560 in taxes and Michael 
Phelps will have to pay up to 
$55,540.
So which country offers 
the most money for winning 
gold? Singaporean Joseph 
Schooling, who defeated Mi-
chael Phelps to win the gold 
in the 100 meter butter?y will 
receive one million Singapor-
ean dollars (US$743,108), 
the largest prize money from 
any country. Indonesia offers 
$342,000 per gold medalist 
and both Azerbaijian and Ka-
zakhstan also offer a whop-
ping $250,000 for each gold 
medalist.
Prizes can extend past cash 
as well. In the past, Russia has 
offered luxury cars to Olympic 
medalists and in South Korea 
medalists can be exempt from 
compulsory military service. 
Germany offers a lifetime sup-
ply of beer and Belarus offers 
unlimited sausages.
However, if you are from 
Great Britain, Norway, Swe-
den, or Croatia, don’t expect 
any prizes at all. None of 
these countries offer cash bo-
nuses for winning an Olympic 
medal.
So if you’re looking to be-
come an Olympic athlete and 
make big money, the country 
you compete for makes a big 
difference in what you could 
earn. Of course, Olympic ath-
letes generally cannot choose 
what country they compete 
for so they have to take what 
they can get. Regardless of 
cash prize, medal-winning 
Olympic athletes are always 
held in high esteem in their 
home countries, and some 
would say respect is the 
ultimate prize.

Here’s what’s new on Net?ix
From sharks to Oscar winners to your next binge-watch
My parents’ Netflix account has been just as (if 
not more) integral to my college education as 
Blackboard. President Jed Bartlett, the Property 
Brothers, every Disney princess, and Tim Riggins 
have been there for me during every late night 
grind, and I’ll never forget the memories we’ve made 
and essays we’ve phoned in.
But we always look to the future. Another year of 
college is upon us, and I need more shows and 
movies to keep me going when the going gets 
tough.
Luckily, Netflix released the list of titles we can look 
forward to in September, and I can already imagine 
these on the split screen next to another 12 tabs.
Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey
Ideally Netflix would do better for us and get the 
Excellent Adventure, but during the late nights 
when only silly stoner humor can remedy the 
existential dread, the Bogus Journey will do just fine. 
In this sequel, the duo travel to literal hell and back 
to fight off a revolutionary traveling back in time 
from the dystopian future their music has created. 
This crazy chaotic comedy will transport you to 
another dimension, making it easier to pretend 
nothing really exists. (Available 9/1)
Hoot
I can’t wait to relive the pre-pubescent glee this 
movie gave me when it came out in 2006. Not 
only did I feel superior because I read the chapter 
book, I got to watch super heartthrob Cody Linley 
and adorable young Logan Lerman portray very 
sensitive, kind, thoughtful, animal-loving boys that 
would love me if they just met me. Also there’s 
something about an owl. (Available 9/1)
Jaws, Jaws 2, Jaws 3, and Jaws: The Revenge
This is one for an all-day Saturday marathon when 
getting out of bed is just too challenging to bear. 
Make as many snacks as you can carry in two trips 
max and enjoy as the highly-regarded original Jaws 
film spirals out of control faster than my sophomore 
spring into a 1987 Golden Raspberry nominee. 
(Available 9/1)
Crash
Sometimes it is important to cry. Crying is good for 
you, and it feels good. There are a few movies that 
are guaranteed to get me to cry every single time, 
even though I know what’s coming, and I often 
watch them on purpose because I like to feel things: 
Rent, Titanic, and Crash. Crash is raw, challenging, 
depressing, and still topical in Trump’s 2016, 
12 years after it stole the Oscar from Brokeback 
Mountain. Still outraged about that. (Available 9/6)
Zootopia
This is for the opposite of Crash, when you’re 
craving bright colors and plots written for small 
children. Zootopia is Disney’s latest gift to 
humankind, telling the story of a small rabbit from a 
farm town who dreams of becoming a police officer 
in the big city. It’s a lighthearted re-rendering of the 
“don’t judge a book by its cover” message, but I plan 
to add a bottle of pinot noir to the occasion to make 
the ride even more fun. (Available 9/20)
Easy S1
This is another one of Netflix’s original shows, which 
have been unbelievably successful considering the 
alarming rate at which they keep pumping them 
out. This one will be an “8-episode anthology drama 
series” that “explores diverse Chicago characters 
as they fumble through the modern maze of love, 
sex, technology and culture.” I find this description 
vague and terrible, but the cast includes Orlando 
Bloom, Dave Franco, Jake Johnson, and Hannibal 
Buress, so I’m willing to watch just in case there are 
any good shirtless scenes. (Available 9/22)

Advice for awkward people
Dear Sarah,
I recently went through 
a bad break-up, but the 
silver lining is that it’s led 
me to a sort of sexual 
awakening. He was the 
only person I’ve ever been 
with, but he was terrible. 
Meaningless hookups 
are more than just fun, 
they make him a smaller 
percentage of my list.
As excellent as these new 
experiences have been 
for me and my twisted 
grieving process, not 
all hookups are created 
equal. Sometimes these 
random duds just don’t 
do it for me. These noobs 
don’t even consider 
any appetizers before 
demanding the entree. 
I just can’t make myself 
salivate enough to make it 
palatable, and it’s simply 
unpleasant. I just lie there 
praying for dessert to 
come already.
I’m not really willing to 
give up on my unhealthy 
coping mechanism just 
yet, because I think I’m 
just skimming the surface 
of this phase. Is there 
something I should be 
doing? How do I wreck 
myself without actually 
physically wrecking 
myself?
Sincerely,
Distressed Restless 
Yinzer
Dear DRY,
I was just recently watching 
Keeping Up with the 
Kardashians, and in episode 
eight of season five, Scott 
and Kourtney also tackled 
the issue of vaginal dryness, 
and, in my opinion, poorly.
They were so ashamed to 
be seen buying lube that 
The Lord paid a stranger 
to go in and do the dirty 
work while he and Kourtney 
hid discreetly in the Benz. 
Nobody should be ashamed 
to use lube.
In fact, I might go so far as 
to suggest that all women 
carry lube in their purse just 
in case. Not to mention, 
alcohol is scientifically 
proven to make things even 
worse. Imagine waking 
up with a hangover. Now 
imagine waking up with a 
hangover in a guy’s bed with 
a sore hooha.
It’s better to be safe than 
chafed; lube can be 
the difference between 
inflammation and 
gratification. So don’t be a 
noob, insist on lube.
Okay, rhyming aside, you 
deserve to enjoy hooking 
up just as much as — if not 
more than — your partner. 
Even if he isn’t as generous 
as he should be, the bar 
should be set higher than 
“not in pain.”
Hooking up can be fun, 
but don’t be stupid. Don’t 
drink too much. Text your 
friends the address of where 
you are so you don’t get 
abducted. Use protection 
and lubrication.
Happy trails to you,
Sarah

4headphones
pillbox 08.29.16
A long time ago, most of us didn’t even think about 
what we were listening to our music on. The stark white 
earphones that came with your iPod (like I said, a long 
time ago) were all that most people even considered. 
Today, things are decidedly different. There are so many 
options to choose from, and so may different types 
of options to choose from, that picking a pair of good 
quality earphones is often a more agonizing decision 
than picking an apparently far more complex product 
such as a phone or a laptop. The ?ip side, of course, is 
that most products you can buy are exponentially better 
than the old clunky white Apple cans. This situation 
isn’t helped by the fact that what you’re buying — good 
sound quality — is decidedly subjective. While some 
people love bass heavy Beats, others despise them for 
their lack of balance.
Here we provide some basic buying advice for mid to 
high end personal audio gear. If you’re ?nally looking to 
ditch that pair of iPod earbuds, join the dark side and 
invest in a nice pair of earphones for yourself, read on:
Shape & Size:
Earbuds: These are the tiny things that go inside 
your ear. The iPod earphones are an example of these. 
They’re typically very convenient and can be worn 
pretty much anywhere, including during physically 
strenuous activities such as a workout. Most high 
quality earbuds today are “in-ear” earbuds. This means 
they ?t reasonably deep inside your ear canal, creating 
a vacuum seal that prevents outside sound from leaking 
in. The biggest disadvantage of earbuds is that their tiny 
size puts a hard limit on how good they can sound. They 
can never produce the wide soundstage, or the deep and 
warm bass of a pair of large headphones.
Headphones: Headphones are much bigger. The 
medium sized ones typically sit ?ush on a user’s ears 
(called on-ear headphones), and the massive ones go 
around and completely enclose a user’s ear (called 
around-ear headphones). For personal listening, nothing 
can compete with a great pair of around-ear headphones 
if your only priorities are sound quality and comfort. 
When done right, these things can sound like a live 
band playing on a stage right in front of you. What you 
compromise on, obviously, is portability. Good luck 
wearing one of these on a walk to class, or better yet, to 
a workout. Also, while these things are great at isolating 
you from the outside world, they tend to leak your music 
to the outside world. So listening in any reasonably quiet 
space, such as a library, is often out of the question.
Priorities: 
The most common rookie mistake that one can make is 
to buy a pair of earphones gauging sound quality and 
sound quality alone. Earphones are things that are going 
to be on or around your ears for extended periods of time. 
Are they comfortable? Do they come on and off easily? 
Are they too heavy or too light? It pays to think about 
these things when buying a pair. Equally important is 
how they look. There’s no point having a spectacular 
pair of earphones that you’re embarrassed to wear in 
public because they’re neon yellow with skull logos all 
over. Ultimately, of course, the most important factor one 
has to consider is price. The good news, however, is that 
the law of diminishing returns holds true particularly 
strongly when it comes to audio gear. The difference 
between a $20 and $100 pair of earphones will be more 
signi?cant than the difference between a $100 and $300 
pair, and the difference between a $300 and $1000 pair 
is even less. Unless you’re a real audiophile, or have 
way too much money to burn, don’t even think about 
earphones that go over $200 — $300.
Marketing and Fact:
Noise Cancelling vs Noise Isolating: Noise 
cancellation was a pretty neat feature introduced by 
Bose (still the pioneers in the ?eld) about a decade 
ago. The idea is that in addition to your music, your 
earphones emit sound that effectively ‘cancels’ the 
ambient noise. This results in an unbelievably, almost 
creepily serene listening environment. Today, several 
earphone manufacturers have products that implement 
this feature. The ?ip side is that Noise Cancellation uses 
a lot of power. Earphones that have this feature will 
usually have a built in battery that needs to be charged 
every once in a while. Another, more purist argument 
is that by introducing extra sounds into the output, 
these earphones don’t accurately recreate the listening 
environment. Noise Isolation, on the other hand, is just 
a fancy word for ‘?ts tightly and blocks out unwanted 
noise’. Noise Cancellation is a really cool feature to have. 
Noise Isolation is something that any decent pair should 
have by default.
Wireless vs Wired: This really comes down to the 
practicality vs sound quality debate. Even today, a wire 
is much better at transmitting audio data from your 
listening device to the earphones than Bluetooth. A 
comparatively priced wired pair will sound signi?cantly 
better than a wireless pair. Another disadvantage 
of wireless can be pairing. You’ve got to switch 
on Bluetooth on two separate devices, select each 
device from the other, and hope that a connection is 
established. With wired, you can just plug and play. That 
said, not having a cable going from your pocket (or bag) 
to your face is a huge convenience, especially when 
you’re exercising or generally moving around.
Reading & Research: 
Most well established earphones have a ton of reviews 
online. Some publications that I look to for advice include 
CNET, Wired, and Engadget. That said, sound, comfort, 
convenience and pretty much everything else that one 
looks for in a pair of earphones is very subjective. There 
really is no substitute for going down to a local store and 
trying out a pair to see how they ?t in/on your ears and 
gauge whether you personally like how they sound.

mumbai
pillbox 08.29.165
You know that moment at the concert when your 
favorite song plays and there is a tangible shift in the 
atmosphere? An energy starts to build, connecting 
everyone and synergizing with your heartbeat. You feel 
the blood dancing in your veins as your heart pumps to 
the rhythm. In that single instance, everything begins to 
transcend and you feel truly, unimaginably alive. That’s 
how I felt for an entire three months during my summer 
spent in Mumbai — alive.
Mumbai, India is a place like no other. The city where 
dreams become reality and reality seems like a dream, 
it is known for being India’s ?nancial capital, tinsel 
town, and cultural melting pot. Not only is it home to 
the Bombay Stock Exchange and Bollywood, but also 
to 13 million inhabitants of different religions, classes, 
ethnicities, and backgrounds. Its architectural marvels, 
historical monuments, and mouthwatering street food 
are only a part of what this vibrant city has to offer.
To summarize my time in Mumbai would be like trying 
to catch moonlight on my palm. By far the biggest 
impact on my summer was made by the people of the 
city. Coming to this city for the ?rst time, completely 
unaware of everything and having a very limited 
knowledge of the regional language, I didn’t have high 
expectations for how my three months were going to 
pan out. But all of that quickly changed as I started to 
interact with the people around me. One of the kindest 
people I met was the caretaker of the guesthouse 
where I was staying. Originally from Nepal, he works in 
Mumbai to support his family that currently lives in their 
native village, thousands of miles away. Every morning 
I would be greeted with a shy smile and a delicious 
breakfast, and over dinner he would attempt to teach me 
Hindi while I tried to teach him English. Those broken 
bilingual conversations, in which he made an effort to 
reassure me that I would be okay, warmed my heart.
Another group of people that changed my summer 
for the better were the friends I made at work. I never 
imagined that I would connect with people at the work 
place, let alone make lasting friendships that I can’t 
imagine my life without now. From sharing strong 
opinions, corny pickup lines, and plates of food at lunch, 
to spontaneously going for stand-up comedy shows 
or go-karting after work, to surprising each other with 
red velvet cupcakes, I somehow managed to meet “my 
people.” One day that really stands out was when I was 
incredibly sick and stuck at work till 7 p.m. One of my 
friends took me to the hospital, bought my meds, fed me 
dinner and tucked me into bed all while I was struggling 
to remain conscious. It’s the big things like these, but 
also the little things like singing karaoke and eating 
pizza in the car while stuck in traf?c for over two hours 
or taking a break from work to go on a walk together, 
that turn friends into family and a city into a home.
I’ve found that the big hearted, strong people of Mumbai 
are just a re?ection of the city itself. The city stands 
strong in its monuments such as the Gateway of India, a 
symbol of how the country drove out British oppression. 
It also stands strong in the face of terror, by rebuilding 
the iconic Taj hotel after the horri?c terrorist attacks on 
Sept. 26, 2008, and showing the world that despite the 
bullet holes, it will rebound. It stands strong in respect 
for religion despite the political and social mechanisms 
driving the country apart and through its local railway 
system that transports six million people every day. Most 
importantly, it stands strong in its honesty to the world. 
Its glittering skyline coexists with Dharavi, one of the 
largest slums in the world, home to one million souls. 
The city doesn’t back away from its imperfections and 
eyesores, but embraces them with an openness that is 
unmatched.
My favorite memory from this summer was when my 
family came to visit and we went to the beach at night. 
You could hear the sound of the waves intermingling 
with sounds of laughter. You could feel the pull of the 
dark ocean in front of you and the lights of the thriving 
city behind you. Above all else, you could feel the pulse 
of the city, the frequency connecting everyone. In that 
moment, absorbing it all with my family by my side, is 
when I knew Mumbai had given me the most precious 
gift — the ability to feel truly, unimaginably alive.

Friday, Aug. 19 at 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Mellon’s 
Orientation team gathered in Rangos ballroom to 
receive both their colored shirts and the responsibility of 
collectively caring for, guiding, and being a friendly face 
to over 1,500 incoming ?rst year students.
Early the next morning, residents began pouring into 
the various housing areas eager to mingle, explore, and 
begin their college careers. Here’s a rundown of the main 
events that took place during the course of the week:
Saturday:
The week kicked off with move in. Students drove in 
from all around the country and ?ew in from all around 
the world. Carnegie Mellon’s staff has long been known 
to make move in as effortless for incoming families 
as possible and, like previous years, the day went by 
smoothly.
Sunday:
Sunday night was the ?rst ?oor meeting for the ?rst 
years, and served as the ?rst opportunity for students 
to get to know their RA’s, CA’s, Housefellows, and OC’s. 
Afterwards, students had the chance to explore the 
various housing communities as each area hosted a 
unique block party event. Events ranged from good eats 
such as the classic grilled pineapples and ham from 
Morewood E-tower and nachos at Mudge, to root beer 
?oats at the Rez and smoothies up near Henderson. 
Stever house offered small grass plants for ?rst years to 
take home and put up in their dorm rooms. Dance parties 
and karaoke were the main attractions up in the Hill and 
Donner area, along with Rita’s outside McGill and Boss.
Monday:
During house day, ?rst years mingled with residents 
throughout their dorms through ice breakers and 
collaborative trips and activities. Later on in the day 
was community collage, where upperclassmen spoke, 
sang, and danced their hearts out to display the vast 
range of cultural experiences that Carnegie Mellon has 
to offer. Monday night was, of course, playfair, the largest 
icebreaker of the week. There was running, mingling 
and dancing galore, followed up by a dance party and a 
full scale water gun war.
Tuesday:
The second full day of orientation donned the famous 
“Making Your Mark” Talk from John Hannon and Gina 
Casalegno, who showed students the wide range 
of opportunities available on campus to help them 
succeed in ful?lling their goals, no matter how obscure 
or interdisciplinary they might seem. Students also 
gather with their ?oors to discuss Randy Pausch’s The 
Last Lecture, and what it could bring to their lives at 
Carnegie Mellon. 
In the afternoon, there were trips to the many 
neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, so that ?rst years could 
shop, eat, and sightsee while taking in the city.
The night began to come to a close with a performance 
from Craig Karges, who as per usual, left jaws dropped. 
The Greek Gala capped off the night with desserts, Mike 
the balloon guy, a photo booth, and of course the many 
Greek Organizations around campus ready to speak to 
interested ?rst years.
Wednesday:
Wednesday began heavy with seminars on community 
standards followed up with ?oor meetings to discuss the 
expectations of students on campus, and ended with 
Incoming ?rst-years “capture the moment”

pillbox 08.29.167
college night, the much awaited night involved schools 
coming together and meeting as a community.
Thursday:
Thursday morning involved academic orientation, which 
lead up to convocation, where students were of?cially 
inducted into the student body. After a dinner of endless 
pastabilities, student had the chance to test their luck in 
both games and a raf?e during Casino Night.
Friday:
Friday morning was a chance for ?rst years to go out and 
get involved in service activities around the Pittsburgh 
community through PACE. This year participation in 
activities gave ?rst years the possibility of earning points 
for their dorms that counted towards the ?nal scores 
in House Wars, which took place later that night. After 
intense competition, with Stever taking ?rst place, Donner 
second, and the Hill slipping down to third.
Saturday:
Pittsburgh Connections, Poster Sales, Quidditch and 
Ballroom Dancing were among the many activities that 
took place on this relatively relaxed day of Orientation. 
The night, however, was rich with excitement as eleven 
freshmen took the stage to show off their incredible 
talents. Along with musical and dance performances, this 
year brought back?ips, glowsticks, and magic.
Sunday:
The ?nal day of orientation involved helping students 
?nd their classes and a ?nal ?oor meeting to kick-off the  
school year.
Good luck class of 2020+! We’re so glad to have you on 
campus.

crowds of Colaba Causeway, one of the biggest and 
most colourful markets in Mumbai. Caught up in her 
excitement, I could do nothing but follow. All around 
me, hawkers sold everything imaginable, from Indian 
garments and fake jewelry to Senheiser Headphones and 
glossy magazines.
I was taken back in time as I saw a little ten year old 
girl lost in the colorful sights and sounds of the market 
around her. She’d dance from shop to shop. She’d 
negotiate with vendors ?ve times her age. She’d tell 
her mother, “Mamma, I want to buy this!” and point 
at the biggest item she could ?nd at a stall. When the 
inevitable refusal came, she’d make the biggest scowl 
she could, and more often than not a compromise would 
be worked out.
The girl was still present in her twenty one year old 
body. I saw her eyes widen to twice their size every time 
she saw something she liked. I saw her subconsciously 
reach out her tiny hand whenever she felt overwhelmed, 
or when she shared stories about her idol Eve Ensler, or 
when she complained about her parents not letting her 
stay out late.
“I’d wake up three hours before school every 
Monday, so I could come to Causeway and pick up 
Theobroma’s ?rst batch of brownies for the week,” 
she told me as we walked along the pavement, 
and I couldn’t help but smile.
“Hey, don’t you dare laugh at me mister!” she glared at 
me, prompting me to break into laughter.
“Jesus, couldn’t you wait till after school?!”
“No, of course not!”
Families rushed past, hawkers cried out, and she pulled 
me along. Suddenly locking those gigantic eyes with 
mine, she said, “We’re going to the end of the market, all 
right?”
“All right,” I grumbled, feigning submission in 
an attempt to ?nd an appropriate response to her 
unabashed glee. I was in a place I’d never been to 
before, with someone I’d met a week before. And yet, I 
hadn’t felt so alive in a long time.
“When love arrives, let it. When it goes, don’t cling to it. 
Set it free. Just be.” 
“I don’t want to force it,” she said to me over lunch, my 
arm wrapped around her waist. “And neither should you. 
When love arrives, let it. When it goes, don’t cling to it. 
Set it free. Just be.”
It was in moments like these that I was given a 
glimpse into how she worked — her thoughts and her 
emotions as they transcended the mundane and poured 
themselves out into the open.
We slanted in different ways — there was very little 
we agreed upon. We could never agree on where to go 
for lunch. While I liked my food simple and light, she 
wanted the spiciest Indian food she could ?nd. While 
I’d do my shopping at a mall, she’d do hers at a bustling 
market like Causeway. While I couldn’t possibly reason 
something through enough, she was the most impulsive 
person I knew. From her bright red hair to her assortment 
of wrist gear to her eccentric Indian clothes, she was 
unlike anyone I had ever met. Reaching a common 
ground with our radically different worlds seemed a 
distant hope, almost an impossibility.
Oblivious to my musings, she dragged me along. As we 
walked on, we entered a tunnel and were momentarily 
surrounded in darkness. I found her looking at me. 
“Wow,” her eyes spelled as I looked on. “I know right,” 
I looked back. I knew because in that brief intersection 
of our gazes and between the sheer absurdity and 
improbability of it all, we had found love.

Stories from the soul: When Love Arrives
Introducing a new column designed for student writers to share their creative writing

Zootopia
Friday, Sept. 2
10:30 p.m.
Sunday, Sept. 4
8 p.m.
Since its release in February 2016, Zootopia has quickly gone on to become a modern 
animated classic. Its namesake metropolis, the setting of the movie, is home to a diversity 
of anthropomorphic animals, prey and predator, land and sea-faring, large and small, that 
have evolved beyond the primitive violence of the wild, and have learned to live together in 
harmony. When this peace is disturbed, it is up to rookie rabbit cop Judy Hopps (voiced by 
Giniffer Goodwin), the ?rst rabbit police of?cer in a department full of intimidating animals, 
to investigate a series of strange occurrences while maintaining the delicate harmony 
between species that Zootopia is home to. Zootopia is an animated movie that deals with 
profoundly mature themes — from racial stereotyping to societal ignorance and paranoia.

The Man Who Knew In?nity
Saturday, Sept. 3
8 p.m. & 10:30 p.m.
The Man Who Knew In?nity tells the true story of Srinivasa Ramanujan (played by Dev Patel), one of the pioneers of mathematics in the early to mid-twentieth century. Ramanujan 
was born to poor parents in colonial Southern India. Through his mathematical genius, he reaches beyond his humble ?nancial background, his lack of early education, and most 
importantly, the prevalent racism of the era to earn the profound respect of the mathematical community. The Man Who Knew In?nity focuses on his early adulthood years at 
Cambridge University, where he meets his lifelong mentor, G.H. Hardy (played by Jeremy Irons).
