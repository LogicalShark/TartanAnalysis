Scholastic Honorary 
Presents Second 
Of Lecture Series
Dr. Solomon B. Freehof, Rabbi 
of Rodef Shalom Temple, will 
speak on a “Review of Four Great 
Books of 1939” next Thursday at 
11:30 in the Theater, College of 
Fine Arts, under the sponsorship 
of Phi Kappa Phi.
This meeting is one in a series 
of open discussions and lectures 
under the auspices of Phi Kappa 
Phi, the only all-college scholas­
tic honorary on campus. The 
first event in the series was a dis­
cussion of current events held 
early this year, which attracted 
a large student audience.
Dr. Freehof conducts the larg­
est modern literature class in the 
country on Wednesday mornings, 
with an attendance varying from 
2,000 to 3,000 persons.
Some of the books recently re­
viewed by Dr. Freehof are “Not 
Peace But a Sword,” by -Vincent 
Sheean, “Days of Our Years,” by 
Pierre Van Paassen, “Inside Asia,” 
by John Gunther, “The Revolu­
tion of Nihilism” by Herman 
Rauschnigg, “Stalin,” by Boris 
Souvarine, “Grapes of Wrath” by 
John Steinbeck, and “Children of 
God” by Vardis Fisher.
Dr. Freehof is the author of 
“A Commentary on the Book of 
Psalms,” “Stormers of Heaven” 
and other books. He has lectured 
extensively throughout the coun­
try before college groups and is 
well known to Carnegie students 
who have heard him at Chapel 
services on campus.
Born in England, Dr. Freehof 
came to this country at the age 
of twelve. He received his A.B. 
in 1914 at the University of Cin­
cinnati,. the degree of Rabbi in 
1915 at Hebrew Union College and 
in 1920 he was given the degree 
of Doctor of Divinity by the same 
school.

Are Unique
Girls Wear Bows; 
Beaux—Striped Sox 
Or Guild Socks Them
Thistle Hall will be the scene 
tonight of the most lively event 
since Tech got a football holiday. 
The Guild girls are offering a 
chance for Carnegie women to 
wear hair ribbons and the boys 
to wear the striped socks they 
bought before coming to Tech. 
The nickels and pennies realized 
from this dance will help some 
less fortunate student through 
school.
| All-day suckers, pop com, coca 
cola, striped candy, and ice cream 
wlil answer your thirst and hun­
ger pangs. The Gammas have 
: worked out a nautical booth of a 
j type that will be kept secret until 
I tonight. The Beetles are threat - 
' ening to tie up their dates in front 
of the house (dog house—get it?) 
where they will sell hot dogs.
For those who prefer the more 
quiet type of entertainment, the 
girls offer fortune telling by sev­
eral different methods and a pup­
pet show in the bomb cellar—and 
they do mean dark! The Kappas’ 
patrons will exhaust their energy 
throwing tennis balls at a face 
dressed in red earmuffs, and the 
W.A.A. is working out a similar 
scheme using cotton wads for 
balls. For a souvenir you may 
capture a balloon or a prize from 
the fish pond sponsored by the 
dorm girls. And the Guild girls 
themselves are running the “let 
us hold your hat” service.
The admission fee is one dol­
lar, with an added charge of five 
cents if the girl doesn’t wear a 
hair ribbon and another nickel if 
the boy doesn’t wear the proper 
socks. (The stripes can go up 
and down or around. They’re not 
particular!) Bill LeRoy will fur­
nish the music for dancing and 
(P.S.) dorm girls get l:30’s.

That Art Again
Series of Blood-Curdling Experiences 
Fails to Daunt Tech-bound Dramat
By Miriam Rost
Anyone who thinks that dra- 
mats lead an exciting life here at 
Carnegie doesn’t know the half of 
it. Wait until you hear what 
Pierre Paulin went through to get 
here.
He is probably the first person 
to come to Pittsburgh from Detroit 
by way of Hollywood. Not that 
it’s a bad idea in reverse—but 
let’s hear the story.
A year ago Paulin was work­
ing in a semi-executive capacity 
at the Chrysler factory in Detroit. 
Taking part in several amateur 
theater group productions didn’t 
satisfy his desire to act, so he left 
Detroit and started for Hollywood, 
where he had hopes of working 
under Max Reinhardt.
On the way Paulin picked up 
about twenty thumb - waggers 
(hitch-hikers to you) including a 
young couple from Chicago. They 
were also heading for California, 
so the three joined forces and con­
tinued westward. When they fi­
nally reached California and set­
tled themselves in a bungalow, the 
half-Indian wife happened to 
¡ mention the fact that her husband 
| was wanted for murder by th.-* 
Illinois authorities.I
Well, after Paulin left (rather 
hurriedly), he investigated the 
possibilities of entering the Rein­
hardt Dramatic School, but de­
cided instead to come to Car­
negie. (Little did he know they 
were going to raise the tuition.)
Crossing thé desert on the re­
turn trip, our traveler picked up 
another hitch-hiker. This gen­
tleman somehow or other got the 
idea that Paulin was out to “do 
him in” and prevented this by 
holding a gun in Pierre’s side dur­
ing the drive. Finally he was dis­
suaded from his belief in Paulin’s 
gangster characteristics and was 
dumped out at the edge of the 
desert. This should prove that 
Paulin can talk, anyhow.
About two days before regis­
tration in September, the Drama 
Department began receiving tele­
grams notifying them to expect 
Pierre at any moment. At last 
he arrived and registered for a 
combination of freshman, sopho­
more, junior, and senior courses, 
proving that the end was worth 
the distance traveled.
He has played featured roles 
in “Lower Depths,” “Daughters of 
Atreus,” and “Excursion.”
Annual Greek Ball 
To Feature Music 
Of Harry James
Charles Kalish Heads Committee 
In Charge of Formal Scheduled 
For March 15 at Hotel Seheulcy
By Art Hirseli
Carnegie’s parade of big; name bands is continuing with 
the signing of Harry James, “The Nation’s Number One 
Trumpeter,” and his orchestra, for the annual Interfraternity 
Formal Dance to be held at the Hotel Schenley on March 15.
Harry built up a great reputation for himself as an in­
strumental soloist before he took over his band, which is rapidly 
gaining prominence in the dance band field. The 24-year old 
trumpeter started out not as a^- 
brass musician, but as a drummer, 
at the age of four, in the orchestra 
of the Mighty Haag Circus. As
his father, who conducted the 
band, played trumpet, Harry nat­
urally set out to become proficient 
in that instrument too.
When he was in high school he! 
won the Texas state-wide compe­
tition for trumpeters. His first job j 
in . the popular music field camc. 
with Ben Pollack’s orchestra. 
Benny Goodman, after hearing 
James, sent for him to join his or­
ganization. He went immediately 
to New York and appeared on1 
Goodman’s program without a 
single rehearsal.
Starts Own Band
It was with Benny that ho built 
up his great following among the 
lovers of jazz. Harry’s tone is ex­
cellent, and his tonguing and fin­
gering are equal to his tonal qual­
ity. 1-Ie always had had the urge 
to have his own band, so after 
three years with B. G., and with 
the advice and help of the “King,” 
he started on his venture.
He lined up a solid and well- 
rounded orchestra of “musician’s 
musicians,” rather than name 
stars. His orchestra has grown in 
popularity so much, mainly be­
cause of Harry’s playing and the 
band’s great arrangements, that it 
is now ranked among the top ten 
swing bands in the country.
According to Charles Kalish, 
’40, chairman of the Interfrater­
nity Formal, Harry. James’ band 
will be the “Band of the Year” 
and all Carnegie students should

R. O. T. C. Plans 
Summer Camp
Initial plans are being made for 
the six-weelc summer camp re­
quired of juniors in the R. O. T. C.
The enrollment exceeds seventy 
men, greater than ever before. 
This is due to a larger enrollment 
in the advanced course. Colonel 
Oscar O. Kuentz announced that 
the Thirds Corps Area headquar­
ters had permitted more vacan­
cies to be filled, thus causing the 
larger enrollment.
Estimates for vaccines with 
which each man must be innocu- 
lated have been sent to head­
quarters. Funds for the operation 
of the camp, which students from 
several schools in addition to Car­
negie attend are being estimated 
and set up.
Preparations will continue until 
the middle of June. Although the 
camp is intended primarily for 
juniors, seniors who have not at­
tended will do so this summer.
Had a Quorum 
Been There, Here 
Would Be News
At the Student Council meet­
ing last Tuesday two requests 
were made, but not approved, be­
cause a quorum was not present. 
The dormitories petitioned for a 
jam session on March 8 in the 
Student Union. The Intramural 
Board presented Ihclr constitution 
for a slight revision. -
Margaret Morrison Senate will 
sponsor an open forum on Tues­
day at 4:30 in the Assembly.

Suggestion For Future 
Carnegie Official Bulletins
Our catalogues describe our courses, and our book of views 
graphically presents our campus, but wliat bulletin informs 
prospective Carnegie students of the slow intellectual death 
that they face when they enroll here? We propose that the 
following paragraphs be added to some official publication next 
year.
To Incoming Freshmen:
You are soon to become students at the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. As an institution of higher learning, Carnegie 
ranks high, and you will probably get much of the professional 
training that you—apparently—seek. But there are certain 
things that you will, or, perhaps, will not find here.
You will find fellow students who are normal in many re­
spects, who are affable, interesting as individuals; set off, 
perhaps, because they are, more than the average student, inter­
ested in their future security, and anxious to find something 
solid in the capriciousness of present-day life. But of real 
things they are not cognizant. The stories you may have heard 
of the mature college student, interested in his place in society, 
interested in the movements of that society, interested in what 
others are doing and thinking, interested in doing and thinking 
himself—these are not true of the students here. There is 
little desire on the campus to learn of real things. Speakers 
are only rarely brought here to stimulate discussion. War may 
threaten, youth may be fighting against inertia and for youth, 
civilization may be proving the lie of the name, but our stu­
dents do not let these things excite—or even interest—them. 
They are stolid, and interested only in security.
We say this to you, incoming freshmen: if you have suf­
ficient interest within yourselves to keep alive to real things, 
and if you do not look to the campus or to your fellow students 
for encouragement in this direction, then you will be happy 
here, and you will live, intellectually. Otherwise stay away, 
for real things are things like wars and the place of idealistic 
youth in fighting them. You see, our students are fooling them­
selves, for there can never be true security as long as real things 
are ignored.
A Propaganda Game 
For Your Next Party
We rarely associate the word “propaganda’’ with the utter­
ances of our own politicians. But then, “propaganda,” like 
• many words, is not thoroughly understood. The Institute for 
Propaganda Analysis recently issued a book entitled, “The Fine 
Art of Propaganda,” in which it set up seven commonly used 
propaganda devices, gave them titles and graphic representa­
tions, and applied them in an analysis of the speeches of Father 
Coughlin.
If you would like to play an interesting little game at your 
next, |>arty, take the speech of any politician and analyze it ac­
cording to the following devices:
(1) Name Calling—symbolized by a turned-down thumb— 
this device gives an idea a bad label so that an audience will 
condemn the idea without examining the evidence.
(2) Glittering Generality—symbolized by a glittering gem 
—this device associates an idea of the propagandist with some 
“virtue word,” so that it is accepted without doubt.
(3) Transfer—symbol, a mask—this transfers the worth of 
something sound over to something unsound.
(4) Testimonial—symbol, a seal and ribbons—in this a 
hated or respected person is quoted as having said something 
bad or good, thereby convincing the audience as the propa­
gandist wishes.
(5) Plain Folks—symbolized by an old shoe—in this device 
the propagandist points out an idea as being good because it is 
“of the people.”
(6) Card Stacking—symbol, an ace of spades—in this de­
vice facts are “hand picked” to present the best or worst pos­
sible picture, as desired.
(7) Band Wagon—symbolized by a bandmaster’s hat and 
baton—the idea here is “Ave’re all doing it, follow the crowd, 
our program is acceptable.”
Play the game this way: simply insert each symbol lifter 
the propaganda device in which it is used. We guarantee that 
this is the modern successor to spin-the-bottle.

Last year, with infinite patience 
and. care, the boys dismantled 
large statues of Hercules and Ve­
nus and carried them down piece 
by piece from the. third floor to 
the large drafting room in the 
basement, and proceeded to put 
their, knowledge of decoration to 
practical use. The application of 
water colors changed the appear­
ance of the two gods miraculous­
ly. Hercules’ plaid trunks, purple 
spats and purple suspenders were 
the envy of every man on the 
campus, or they should have been. 
Venus? Well, Venus had her 
clothes painted on too. Using 
water colors showed foresight, be­
cause sometime thereafter, the ar­
chitects were swabbing down the 
statues with an instructor as over­
seer. So have many works of art 
been destroyed.
Their long hours and monot­
onous work are apparently the 
cause for these periodic outbreaks. 
Once, within the memory of the 
seniors, after working far into the 
night, several architects dropped a 
large water cooler from the third 
floor—simply for the sake of 
something to do. The practice of 
sinking—now outlawed by the ad­
ministration—helped to fill this 
need. Sinking involved placing 
some unlucky one in a large sink 
and letting the water flow. It was 
popular because it was something 
that could be done anytime. No 
planning, no preparation, no ma­
terials necessary. It was practiced 
a little too thoroughly one night 
and water began to trickle from 
the ceiling of the music room be­
low. The trickle became a stream. 
The music department expressed 
its opinion of the recreational pas­
times of 'the architects in- unmis­
takable language.
One by one the activities of 
the architects, much to the dis­
gust of the seniors, are being cur­
tailed. Sinking, dice, and bridge 
games have been banned. Bring­
ing radios into the drafting room 
is prohibited; no exception was
made even when the architects 
were on charette during the Notre 
Dame game.
Outlawing one form of enter­
tainment only challenges the stu­
dents’ ingenuity in inventing an­
other. The latest made its ap­
pearance last semester. Matches 
stuck into drinking straws and 
shot with rubber bands make ef­
fective and spectacular missies, 
lighting as they strike. Sometimes 
the results are too spectacular. One 
night the boys started a com­
fortable blaze going in a bush out­
side the hut. When a librarian 
turned fireman and came out to 
put out the blaze, she was un­
ceremoniously chased back by a 
hail of arrows.
Before trying the hut, smaller 
and less inflammable targets were 
used. Two direct hits were scored 
on Colonel Kuentz. The architects 
report that the Colonel showed 
good spirit and discipline under 
fire.
For the Roller Skaters
Followers of the wooden wheels 
are beating a path to the Diamond 
Square Roller Rink these days. 
Now that the winter weather—

A great deal of Harry’s popu­

theme song, “Cirbirbin,” “On a

By “DOC" BURKE, Sports Editor
After a year’s layoff the fair damsels of Carnegie Tech 
again have shouldered rifles and are out to regain their position 
as the number one collegiate girls’ rifle team in the country.
For some reason last year the team was discontinued much 
to the dismay of all concerned. However, this year the team has 
continued where it left off in 1938, having already 
Rhode Island State and Kansas in postal matches. Against these 
schools the Carnegie shooters rang up a total of 496 out of a 
possible 500. Although this score seems sufficient, we are in­
formed by Coach R. C. Sommer that 498 or 499 is the usual total 
tamed in by his girls’ teams.
For four successive years, from 1935 to 1938 inclusive, the 
team took the National Women’s Collegiate Championship. 
Possibly, if the team had been shooting last year, the other 
schools would by now be figuring out some way—by foul means 
or fair—to get their hands on the trophy.
This year Rosemary Novak heads the group of girls on the 
team. Rosemary shot on the championship ’37 and ’38 teams, 
and judging by her scores to date she hasn’t lost her shooting 
eye. Other veterans on the team are Mary Thomas and Jane 
Purse. The rest of the first five are Mary Louise Reich, a new­
comer, and either Shirley Bernstein or Louise Zonge.
There is not any doubt that the reviving of the Women’s 
Rifle Team has been a good step. We hope that the team is now 
here to stay.
F-M WILL BE TOUGH
With the signing of Franklin and Marshal, Carnegie Tech’s 
1940 Football schedule is complete.
Although we stated in this column that the Tartan schedule 
for next season is light, we believe that the signing of F-M has 
made it a great deal more difficult. While the Lancaster school 
does not have a particularly enviable reputation as a football 
power, there is a movement on foot towards that goal.
It is not a secret that F-M is beginning to emphasize foot­
ball. In order to find proof for this statement all one has to do 
is to take a look at some of the material now at that school. We 
did, and we think it only fair to warn the good doctor that he 
won’t have an easy afternoon on his hands next fall when he 
takes his boys to Lancaster.
NOTES FROM OUR SCRAPBOOK
Those two young fellows yon see on the players’ bench at 
every basketball game are Harold Cohen and Noble Jorgenson, 
two of Tech's most ardent rooters. Both attend Alderdice High 
School . . . John Billie, Geneva basketball star, comes from 
the same town in New Jersey as do Student Council President, 
Charles Trapp, and Tartan Editor, Bernard Lebovit . . . Fred 
Feiler, hockey goalie, has received an offer to play profession­
ally . . . Incidentally, what ever happened to the idea of hav­
ing a crew at Tech? ... If the Freshman basketball team plays 
the “Terrible Tartans” tomorrow night, there is a.possibility 
that “Speedo’’ Friedlander, Frosh coach, will play against his 
own proteges.
Carnegie Nators 
Swim Delaware 
Tomorrow at 2:30
Carnegie’s varsity mermen won 
their fifth contest of the current 
season last Wednesday in their 
.home pool, the victims—Slippery 
Rock State Teachers College. This 
meet, a prolongation of many 
years of friendly swimming rival­
ry, can be listed as one of the 
most exciting water battles of the 
year, for each race was exciting­
ly close.
The Tartans started things with 
a big splash by taking the Med­
ley relay due to the determined 
efforts of Bill Molvie, Willis An­
thony, and Bob Vance. Harold 
Hirsch swamped all opposition to 
finish first in the next race—the 
220-yard free style sprint event.
As was my wont during the 
football season, and as the end 
of the winter track season is 
now approaching, I am going 
to make a few predictions con­
cerning the National Indoor 
Championships in Madison Square 
Garden tomorrow.
The “Old Man of the Mile,” 
Glen Cunningham, is definitely 
not finishing his last season in a 
blaze of glory. The mile run 
should, in all probability go to. 
Wisconsin’s Chuck Fenske with 
Louis Zamperini second and Cun­
ningham third.
In the two-mile event, another 
newcorrfer, Walter Mehl of Wis­
consin should win. Jimmy Her­
bert ought to eclipse the 600-yard 
run and Long John Woodruff the 
middle distance affair. In the 
hurdles it will be Allan Tolmich 
and in the sprints either Norman 
Ewell or Eulace Peacock. N. Y. 
U. ought to take the mile relay, 
while the two-mile is an open 
affair with possibly Manhattan in 
the winning slot.
Riggs Is Still Tops 
Judging on the results this win­
ter, Bobby Riggs is still the high
man in the tennis field. He has 
been ranked number one in the 
indoor meet with Don McNeil sec­
ond. Riggs has taken almost ev­
ery title that he has entered into, 
and his main opposition has come 
from McNeil, Elwood Cooke, and 
Hal Surface. . With Wayne Sabin 
and Gene Mako having been de­
clared ineligible to compete in 
amateur tennis for the remainder 
of the year, it looks like a clear 
field for Bobby the rest of this 
year.
In the latest ranking by the As­
sociated Press sports writers, 
N. Y. U.’s basketball team is 
still leading the country in its 
field. Duquesne’s Iiilltopper five 
is placed second while Southern 
California is in the third position. 
All three will most probably meet 
in the Garden later in the year 
for the mythical “National Bas­
ketball Championship” along with 
such squads as the Oklahoma Ag­
gies, Duke, Texas, and were it 
possible for Big Ten teams to com­
pete, Indiana and Purdue. The 
winning game should pit N. Y. U. 
against the Dukes, with either one 
conquering.

Tech’s Riflemen Place 
Second in Postal Match «------------------------Green and Minton 
Are High Scorers 
W ith 286 and 277
Completing their second postal 
match, Tech riflemen found that 
their score of 1387 was good 
enough for second place. The U. 
S. Marine Barracks took the win­
ner’s laurel with, a score of 1394. 
Following Tech were Ala-on Uni­
versity with 1348, Michigan School 
of Mining and Technology with 
1361 points, and Ohio University 
scoring only 1312.
Tech’s scoring was as follows:
Green ................................288
Minton ...’.................. 277
Penberthy ........................276
McMillan .............................275
Whittum ............................273
“Tech’s 1387 is still not the best 
Tech can do” says Coach Som­
mers, “but the season is still 
young.”
Next w’eek finds the Tartan 
Shooters gunning against 12 teams 
in the third of the Postal Matches. 
Iowa State, S. Dakota, Michigan, 
Drexel Institute, John Hopkins, 
Dayton University, Montana State, 
Rose Polytech, Texas Tech, Yale, 
Penn State, and Brooklyn Poly­
tech are the opponents. Yale, who 
always has a good team, has been 
shooting a steady 1394, seven 
points better than Tech, and 
seems to be the team to beat. 
Michigan and Penn State are al­
ways dangerous and will be right 
up on top with the leaders.. So 
far this season, Tech has won 
about six or seven matches, los­
ing only two. A clean sweep on 
next Saturday will give Tech a 
high national rating.
Scobell Upsets 
Citcom, 29-27
SAE’s Win Over 
Stubborn DU Team
Scobell Hall’s scrappy five 
threw a monkey wrench into the 
Citcom Clan’s title hopes last 
Tuesday night, when the Clan’s 
previously unbeaten quintet fell 
before the improved Scobell squad 
by a two-point margin, 29-27.
The dorm aggregation led at 
half-time, 13-11, and held stub­
bornly to their slender margin 
until the final whistle. Grant Wil­
son, Clan forward, led both teams 
in scoring with 12 counters; for 
the Noble Scobell men the 
guards, Bub and Padden, showed 
the- way with eight and seven 
points respectively.
This victory was the second in 
as many nights for Scobell. They 
defeated the AIChE squad on 
Monday in two extra periods by 
a 28-23 count. The score was 
knotted at 18-18 at the end of 
the regulation time, and at 22-22 
at the close of the first overtime 
session.
Staving off a last period drive 
which fell only two points short 
of victory, the SAE’s downed the 
DU’s, 36-34. Entering the final 
quarter the DU’s were on the 
wrong end of a 30-18 count. Led 
by Cy Herre they turned on the 
heat and ran up 16 points, but 
SAE’s tallied six of their own to 
squeeze out the victory.
Panther Squad 
Suffering From 
Loss of Flayers
Tech’s basketball team, which 
has yet to win its fifth game of the 
year, will tackle a powerful Pitt 
Panther five in the gym tomorrow 
night. Pitt, earlier in the season 
man-handled the Skibos with a 73 
to 42 score.
Pitt, however will not be as 
strong as in the last encounter, for 
they will be without the sendees 
of Rip Collins, Jack Sherer, and 
Bill Egan. These three helped a 
great deal all through the season 
and will be a definite loss to the 
Panthers. They still will have to 
bolster up their ranks, although 
Ed Straloski, who scored 30 points 
against the Plaid at the Stadium, 
and their captain, Mel Port, will 
be on hand.
The visitors have beaten a lot 
of formidable opposition including 
Navy and Cornell, but last week 
went down to defeat 34 to 29 at 
the hands of Geneva.
Stark on Top
Captain Rube Stark, by virtue 
of scoring 27 points against Tem­
ple and Franklin and Marshall 
still is on top in the city in scor­
ing. He will lead a rejuvenated 
Tartan five out onto the floor 
against the Panthers. The boys 
have rested up after their trip 
and are in shape again. Tumpane, 
Burch, Sturgeon, and Holets will 
most probably start along with 
Stark,’ but Alexander, Fisher, and 
Burke among others will see serv­
ice in an attempt to avenge their 
defeat of earlier this season.
Women Riflers 
Down R. I. S., 
U. of Kansas
Rifle barrels are plenty hot these 
afternoons in the Margaret Mor­
rison rifle range for the women’s 
rifle team is shooting it out. At 
present the only matches being 
held are postal matches,! In.-thsse, 
various colleges throu^houtfN'f'Mfe' 
country hold shoots at their home 
rangés and mail the results to the 
other colleges participating. Last 
week five girls totaled 496 points 
out of a 500 possible to defeat 
j the University of Kansas and 
Rhode Island State in postal 
matches. Novak, Thomas, and 
Purse had perfect scores, Zonge 
had a 99, and Bernstein a 97. This 
is remarkable shooting for a group 
of college girls.
Captain Bnd Wilson, 
Feiler Star; Carran 
Sparks Visitors
Displaying the best brand of 
hockey tliat they've shown all 
season the Tartan slcatbrs lost a 
game to Lady Luck and Western 
Reserve in the last ten seconds of 
play by a 2-1 count.
The Skibo front line clicked off 
passes that worked them right 
past the Reserve defense. In the 
sixth minute of the first period 
Art Burleigh skated in fast and 
hard on the right side, and gave 
a pass to Bud Wilson waiting in 
front of the cage. Covered by 
two Reserve defensemen, Wilson 
deftly picked the puck away from 
them and sent it into the cords 
to give Tech a one-point lead.
In the second period, the Tar­
tan lines kept heckling the Re­
serve goalie, but the majority of 
the scoring chances came with the 
second line on the ice, and while 
they gave Reserve many anxious 
moments they were unable to 
blink the lights again. Half way 
through the period, Tech sent 
four rushes down the rink on a 
power play. This wave, however, 
boomeranged when the Reserve 
center, Carran, picked up a loose 
puck, worked his way past Ely, 
who was alone at defense, and 
scored on a shot that Feiler would 
have stopped if overanxiousness 
hadn’t caused him to fall too soon.
With but ten second left to send 
it into an overtime, the Plaid de­
fense failed to cover Carran who 
camped under Freddie Feller's 
stick until his linc-mate, Young, 
whipped him a pass which he 
shot into the mesh, making the 
final count 2-1 In Reserve’s fa­
vor.

Barbara Kramer, Social Work '42
Question — Tartan’s Editorial 
Policy?
Answer—I admire the frankness 
and outspokenness of the editor­
ials, although I sometimes feel that 
they may be more smoke than 
fire. I think, that this tendency 
is far better than a timid, docile 
attitude. If nothing else, they 
serve to stimulate thought by 
their very controversiality. Again 
I say that I admire the courage 
and frankness of (lie policy.
Dorothy Ellen, P and D ’43. 
Question: Why Tech, when Pitt's
just around the corner? Answer: 
“Tradition.” Question: As an
arts student, what do you think 
of Maggie Murphs? Answer: 
“They’re all right, I pity them with 
all that nightwork.” Question: 
Anything to get oil your chest? 
Answer: “I want more time to
do what I want to do.”
Alright, We’re Listening25 Years Ago

“Alright we’re listening” is your 
column and as such is completely 
open to criticism and suggestion 
—and we want it, plenty of it. So 
do let us know what questions you 
want asked and we’ll ask them.
Now we proceed to this week’s 
victims.
Tolly Jensen, P&D ’41 
Question—Is Tech lacking in 
school spirit?
Answer—Definitely not! — it’s 
there but there’s no place to put 
it. Tech students just haven’t 
been well enough informed, in 
general, about .what’s going on. 
If all the student organizations— 
Scottie, Tartan, Bagpiper, and 
Technical—let people know what 
was happening, our supposedly 
lethargic school spirit might have 
a definite direction. (Bravo, Pol­
ly—we’re with you to a “man”!)
Paul Johnson, M.H.V. ’11
Question—Is Tech lacking in 
school spirit?
Answer—Yes and no. Tech stu­
dents have heavy schedules to 
carry and many live oi'C campus 
so that it is inconvenient for them 
to take active interest. However, 
the schools reputed to have out­
standing school spirit probably 
have as many dull moments as 
Tech does.
Fred Kindi, Physics ’42
Question—What do you think of 
Tartan’s Editorial Policy?
Answer—Although I didn't 
agree at all times with, the opin­
ions expressed (that’s your pre­
rogative, Fred) I think the sub­
jects discussed were interesting 
and important. However I believe 
that a happy medium between 
subjects of national and purely
Feb. 25, 1915: Entertainment
supreme would be provided by 
the combined Glee and Mandolin 
Clubs at the Schenley Hotel on 
Friday, March 12. The Combined 
Musical Club was directed by 
Gregoria Scalzó, well-known in­
structor and orchestra leader. The 
Musical Clubs Issue of the TAR­
TAN promised that a “most en­
joyable time will prevail.” Any­
one who bought $50 worth of 
tickets or more would be assured 
of the choicest seats.
This home concert was no hap­
hazardly-planned affair, but was 
part of the tenth anniversary cel­
ebration. When ground was first 
broken for the Carnegie Tech­
nical School in 1905, provisions 
were made for a mammoth cele­
bration of Carnegie Day to be held 
in ten years. In the meantime 
the school had grown from a one- 
building affair into an institution 
boasting five centers of learning.
Student Union?
At the beginning of the fall se­
mester, students had contributed 
$200 to an original grant of $1,000 
made by the trustees to provide a 
Student Union. The previous 
month, pool and billiard tables 
had been bought, fine rugs laid, 
lounges and upholstered chairs 
ordered, and magazines furnished. 
The new union was christened the 
Trinity Club.
The Margaret Morrison day 
school basketball team had defeat­
ed the night school team by the 
score of 29-1. Despite this not- 
too-decisive. victory, it was agreed 
that the day school team needed 
much more practice. Girls on both 
teams clapped their hands con­
sistently in order to signal one 
another. This practice, although 
not technically classified as a foul, 
was looked down upon by sports 
authorities.
Miss Jane Addams of Chicago 
was to address students of the In­
stitute in Carnegie Hall on March
4. Her subject was announced as 
“The Changing Ideals of Peace.” 
The meeting was open to the 
public.
New Paper
The second edition of the “Bag­
pipe,” an Industries newspaper, 
had appeared recently and was 
very popular with students of all 
departments.
Dr. Cook of the Oakland Meth­
odist Church claimed that the 
whole trouble in Europe lay in the 
fact that “nations do not have the 
bond of fellowship which should 
make them brothers, instead of 
enemies.”
De Wolf Hopper and the Gilbert 
and Sullivan Opera Company were 
scheduled to appear at the Alvin 
Theater for a series of “spectacu­
lar performances of the best comic 
operas.”
Comparable to the “Confucius 
Say” jokes were the following 
morsels:
“It’s great to be an editor,
To sit up late at night;
And scratch your wool 
And shoot the bull,
And write, and write, and write.” 
“It’s fine to be a Glee Club shark, 
And meet while others bone;
To put the hop in ‘barber shop’ 
And groan, and groan, and groan.”
What to Wear
Where?
. . . ET POUR LES FEMMES
All tired and weary of traips­
ing around through slush and pud­
dles and snow heaps? Well, then, 
just settle back and rsad of these 
sparkling fashions all set to lift 
your thoughts from splashed 
stockings to singing robins and 
all that sort of spring stuff.
Simply an indespensable for 
campusing, towning and dating, 
(sort of a triple-threat affair) is 
a princess style blue and white 
checked-wool’ coat over a plain 
navy wool dress. Simple—but 
stunning.
Maybe you’re tired of nothing 
but skirts and jackets for school. 
If so, don’t despair. This season’s 
“long-torso” jackets that make 
you look as thin as thin are the 
cure for your blues.
Suits—of course. You’ll be even 
more certain of the necessity for 
suits after you see this three- 
piece outfit in a very fine plaid 
in wine, haze blue, and white. 
The reefer coat and the suit jacket 
are both in this plaid, and the 
straight skirt repeats the haze 
blue.
Newest and smartest of blouses 
is the man-tailored silk shirt with 
convertible collar. If you must 
wear your pearls, wear them in­
side the neck, but it’s equally 
smart without them. And have 
you heard? Calots (skull caps) 
are very much in the fashion pic­
ture again, and why not have one 
in the material of your suit?
With Pittsburgh going social­
conscious again—what with danc­
ing here and there, be the toast 
of the town in a stiff silk mar­
quisette formal in muted rainbow 
shades ranging from chartreuse 
through aquamarine to pink, end­
ing at the base of a tiny shoulder 
strap in a gigantic lovely bow?
FOR THE MEN . . .
With the coming or increased 
emphasis upon better dress for 
college men, the correctness of 
accessories has assumed a high 
place in the clothes consciousness 
of the average student.
Number one on the list of ac­
cessories is the shirt. Its pre­
eminence is natural, of course, 
since, outside of the suit, it is the 
first article of dress to meet the 
eye of the observer.
Ninety per cent of the style of 
a shirt is in the collar, and this 
year brings greater emphasis (as 
far as the college man is con­
cerned) on the collar models, rath­
er than pattern or color. Reach­
ing a new high in popularity isChesterfield presents a 
Combination you can count on for
the oxford button-down English 
type, with the bulging roll front 
at the tie knot. While such a 
collar is not the neatest looking 
one in the world, it certainly car­
ries an air of casual “savoir- 
faire.” It sets off a tweedy Shet­
land suit or sports coat as noth­
ing else can.
Another style which has 
achieved a high measure of popu­
larity is the round point, which 
is shown in the accompanying 
sketch. A revival of an old style, 
one of about forty years ago, in 
fact, it has a definite air which 
should prevent its dying out 
again.
These styles, in addition to the 
wide-spread and the tab, can be 
obtained on practically every type 
of patterned or colored shirt. The
AND BETTER TASTE
JLhe perfect blend of 
the world’s best cigarette to­
baccos in Chesterfield gives you 
the two things you want and 
look for in a cigarette . . . Real 
Mildness and Better Taste.
Then, if you add that 
Chesterfields are far cooler, 
you know you have a ciga­
rette that really satisfies.
perennial favorites, white and 
blue, are still preferred, how­
ever, because of their stapleness.
Among the figured styles, the 
candy or pin stripes are leaders. 
The definite trend toward the 
conservative, which has been not­
ed before in this column, prevails 
in shirts as well.
CLARK CABLE
AND
VIVIEN LEICHThe boys from Scobell have 
been acting rather peevish lately. 
In fact there are very few of 
them who aren’t downright crabby. 
What’s the matter, boys, don’t 
you sleep well at night? Some of 
us are wondering what that new 
secret greeting is all about—you 
know, brush your arm, and then 
stamp on the ground?
Flash! Flash! Another spark­
ler has found its way to the Tech 
campus. This one comes all the 
way from New Jersey, to lucky 
Mary Thomas. Consider this a 
formal announcement, boys.
It’s only a month since Marcie 
Feiner became of age and had a 
lovely “freedom party”—now she’s 
tying herself up for good. Cy 
Felser is the lucky man. The wed­
ding will be June 30th.
The third engagement ring of 
last week-end.was waiting at the 
home management house for 
Jeanne Ditzler Sunday night . . . 
How did A1 know where to send 
it?
We always knew the music stu­
dents had, shall we say—imag- 
inaton, but we couldn’t a fall 
swallow their story that a huge 
snowball rolled into Counterpoint 
class unaided. Looking for the 
Snow Queen, no doubt.
Off the cuff—has anybody 
thought of calling Beta Bob Vance 
“Vancey-pants? ”
Where have you been all these 
weeks, Mr. K. of the English de­
partment? It seems that “Ye olde 
professor” had not heard about 
the Confucius Say craze, so he 
asked one of his evening students 
to give him an example of the 
famous sayings. It took her a 
long while to remember one suit­
able enough to relate before the 
class.
Betty McGhee has, against her 
wishes, been initiated into the 
“Minus-Appendix” Clan. She pre­
ferred the straight-run over the 
crescent-shaped emblem. In other 
words, she’s recovering from an 
appendix operation.
We should say that the T. X.’s
found a really good solution for 
their “twins” problem. The first 
of the Church twins to come in 
view is always “Pete” which 
makes the other twin “Re-Pete.”
Tsk! Tslc! A senior secretarial 
is responsible for this one. Some 
Household Ec’ers were praising 
their visiting obstetrician-lecturer 
so highly that Miss M. M. Secre­
tary remarked hopefully, “Oh 
good, maybe she can fit me up 
with a pair of glasses.”
Observations at the picture-tak­
ing party sponsored by the Thistle 
last Sunday afternoon: Most of
Student Council evidently afraid 
of getting tootsies wet in snow. 
Result—no picture.
Aida Squitieri and Mary Lou 
Proellichs in almost every pic­
ture except those for men only.
Many dead-pan expressions for 
Tartan Staff picture. Even more 
dead pans for Scottie, however.
One of the features of the JP 
was the sensational dancing of 
Johnny Lloyd and Betty Ries— 
they claim it was the “doggie.”
Orchids to:
Margaret Sullivan — charming, 
quiet, friendly . . . plenty of ac­
tivities, but finds time to attend 
all the dances ... a coed’s girl 
and an engineer’s ideal.
And to:
Eleanor Carlock — The only 
woman ever to hold the position 
of vice president of Student Coun­
cil. One of the most poised girls 
on campus, and a rare combina­
tion of beauty, brains, and abil­
ity.
Police Methods 
Bow in Favor 
Of Psychology
By means of one word, “Please,” 
the gardeners at Carnegie Tech 
have been able to accomplish what 
a veritable police cordon could 
not.
Ever since a cement walk has 
been placed from the book store 
entrance to one of the side doors 
of Industries hall, students have 
beaten a track across the lawn 
to Engineering hall. Neither rain 
nor the last deep snow could keep 
them from their appointed path 
across the lawn, in their efforts 
to get to class on time and save 
a few calories.
With their accustomed vigilance 
the guardians of the grass went 
into action. Police methods were 
not for them, nor were they to 
use the usual “K«ep off the grass, 
this means you” signs. Instead 
they applied their psychology les­
sons and erected signs bearing the 
single word “please.’*
Now all has changed. Students 
about to trespass upon the restrict­
ed area eye the sign, cautiously 
glance about to see if their act 
was observed, and then with eased 
Conscience go about by the ce­
ment walks.
