Present local quotas of 1114 
and 1210, for Tech and Pitt re­
spectively, were filled in the 
registration period for engineer­
ing defense courses which ended 
January 4, 1941. Classes started 
last Monday, and no more applica­
tions will be accepted for the 
courses given in this area.
The entire program, including 
the Penn State Extension at P. 
C. W., is expected to be in opera­
tion by the end of this month with 
Penn State and West Virginia 
taking care of 8,000 and 1,200 re­
spectively.
In ox-der to accommodate the 
large enrollment at Tech, the 
Faculty Club Room and the old 
Student Union have been convert­
ed into drafting rooms. Sixty- 
eight drawing tables equipped 
with individual fluorescent lamps 
have been installed and there are 
more to come. A booth and a 
sound projector have been set up 
in room 104, Industries Hall. Mo­
tion picture projectors have also 
been purchased lor the use of the 
men taking the course in Produc­
tion Engineering.
of the Lock
By Jack Shore
Octavius Tiberius De Castilone. 
When this title was trumpeted 
through the halls of the Roman 
Senate, the shouting and the 
tumult ceased, for it announced 
the entrance of the greatest of her 
sons that was begotten in the 
golden age of Rome. Philosopher, 
statesman, and soldier, no citizen 
of the seven hilled city surpassed 
Octavius. The proud descendant 
of this great Roman, the possessor 
of a heritage as old as civilization, 
is a well known Tech campus 
figure, Count Angelo Tibery.
Angelo has dropped his title— 
feeling it to be a hindrance in a 
democratic country and prefers to 
be known by his nickname 
“angel.” Tibery’s physical fea­
tures are, according to the Holly­
wood standard, romantic: five-foot 
five, slim, dark, a suave Ronald 
Colman mustache and an aquiline 
nose that would lend distinction 
to any face. His friends main­
tain that he is beautiful, but an 
objective glance would show that 
he is not much more than hand­
some. Tibery places, a high value 
on momentoes, and instead of 
loving and leaving, keeps a lock 
of each girl’s hair, the rape of 
which he feels is justified consid­
ering his sentimental nature.
Tibery was rather reticent when 
I interviewed him. He was per­
fectly willing to talk about him­
self, but the few other opinions 
gleaned from him were usually 
obscure. When asked what he

“The Need of Religious Convic­
tions in Life Today” is the theme 
adopted lor this year’s annual Re­
ligious Emphasis Week, February 
10 to 17.
As in last year’s program the 
various fraternities and dormi­
tories will have meetings during 
the week to discuss this topic and 
others, with local ministers as 
guest speakers. The most out­
standing event of the week will be 
the February 11 chapel. Here 
one prominent representative 
from each of the three faiths, 
Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish, 
will speak in an informal dis­
cussion during the chapel. Later 
that day, beginning at 4:30, there 
will be an informal forum at the 
Carnegie Union where the speak­
ers will be on hand to answer any 
questions put to them. Students 
and faculty members of all religi­
ous denominations are invited to 
attend.
thought of American women, the 
couiu was so choked with emo­
tion, that he could only roll his 
eyes. Angie believes that all our 
activities should be approached 
with a scientific attitude, and con­
sidering his amorous successes, 
science is the coming thing.
Carrying on the physical 
prowess of his forebears, Angelo 
is exceptionally good at fencing 
and boxing. He learns rapidly 
and now does not even get his 
hair mussed when sparring. His 
opponents are wary of stepping 
into the ring with him, for that 
delicate left hand, that should be 
holding a violin, carries power.
Speed and power intrigue the 
lad. He considers icy streets with 
sleet falling as perfect driving 
conditions. The way he slews 
around corners has everyone in 
the drafting department jittery, 
but when the boy drives, death 
takes a holiday. His cars never 
last long, and all have a topspeed 
over ninety. He has. nerves of 
iron, and is an adroit driver, and 
has had ho accidents so far. He 
prefers the heavier, more expen­
sive cars but anything with a girl 
in it satisfies the “angel.”
Tibery is studying civil engi­
neering at Tech and is in his jun­
ior year. He speaks with no ac­
cent whatsoever and has accli­
mated himself to all our native 
customs. He was born in Pitts­
burgh and has lived here the 
greater part of his life.

Sorenson Address 
AIEE Meeting
Tech’s Electrical Engineers are 
to be well x'epresented at the Stu­
dent Board Conference of the En­
gineer’s Society and the American 
Institute of Electrical Engineers 
which is being sponsored today 
in the Webster Hall Hotel, by the 
Carnegie Bx-anch of the Engineer’s 
Society. This is a really big 
event for Tech’s Engineei’s. The 
program includes an inspection 
of the Copperweld Steel Company 
Pi-opex-ties and a luncheon, to be 
followed at 2:30 by the actual 
Conference.
G. R. Patterson, chaix-man of 
the Pittsburgh section of the AIEE 
and Assistant Professor of Elec- 
li’ical Engineering hei'e at Tech, 
will deliver the welcoming address 
at the Conference. Included in 
the technical progx*am is an ad- 
rdress by Royal W. Sorenson, pres- 
ideal of the AIEE, and vax'ious stu­
dent talks. Plere again Tech is 
repx-esented; Jobe Jenkins, ’41, is 
speaking on the Design of Elec- 
tronic Musical Instruments, which 
includes an explanation of the 
workings of an electric organ. Al­
so represented on ’ the program 
are Penn State, West Virginia 
University, and Pitt. Tech is also 
represented by Malcolm B. Trim­
ble, ’41, who is entered as a dis­
cussion Ieadex\
At six thirty tonight the sen­
ior gx’oup has a dinnex* in honor 
of Royal W. Sorenson of Califor­

In an attempt to settle the pub­
lications’ px-oblem to the satisfac­
tion of the administration and the 
student body, Lester Cullen pre­
sented before Student Council last 
Tuesday a new plan for a policy 
board. Mr. Cullen suggested that 
a boax-d composed of the editox-s of 
all the campus publications, which 
include the TARTAN, the Thistle, 
the Scottie, the Technical, the 
Dox-m Bagpiper, and the Citcom- 
mentator, an<? the Publication 
Chairman of Student Council, be 
placed in contx-ol of the policies 
and the administx'ation of these 
publications. This control would 
include the approval of the incom­
ing staffs front year to year, to 
px-event the control of any pub­
lication by one fraternity or one 
special group.
Before Mr. Cullen’s proposal 
was made, Mr. Jamison, the Pub­
lications Chairman, read a letter 
from the Senior Staff of the TAR­
TAN, which suggested that the 
Publication Chairman be made a 
voting member of the Senior Stall1 
and thus constitute a policy board 
that would work directly with the 
staff. This suggestion was not vot­
ed upon at the meeting because 
Mr. Cullen’s motion was placed 
upon the floor. Council seemed 
to feel, also, that the suggested 
remedy for the situation was so 
radical that it should be deliber­
ated upon for several weeks be­
fore a vote should be taken. Since 
there will be no meetings until 
next semester, the motion was ta­
bled until February 4,

Student Pilots
Spring phases of the Civilian 
Pilot Training Program here are 
scheduled to start Saturday, Feb­
ruary 1. The primary program is 
open to students in good standing, 
evening students and alumni. Ap­
plicants must have attained their 
19th birthday on or before Feb­
ruary 1, have spphomore of- high­

Under a special “Pan Ameri­
can College Phase” citizens of 
Latin American countries who are 
bona fide students enrolled in in­
stitutions participating in the 
training program are also eligible 
for flight training.
Steps to secure employment 
for members of the senior class 
have been taken by the Bux-eau 
of Placements. Employment infor- 
mation sheets have been already 
distributed to seniors, and those 
who have not yet turned in their 
sheets are requested to bring them 
when- they have their talk with 
Mr. Wangeman, Assistant Head of 
the Bui’eau. Dates for a number 
of intex’views ax*e already schedul­

Although cheerleaders now re­

so honored at the time that AI was 
a student. In appreciation not 
only of his work as a student

Only four othors have been so 
honored In the past, Judge Walter 
P. Steffen, former football coach; 
Bert Munhall, willing and able ' 
athletic trainer; Mr. Frank Ey- 
man, popular instructor in tho 
Physical Education Department; 
and Sergeant Sommers, coach of 
many champion rifle teams.
When Al was a student at Car­
negie, he was* known to all as a 
clever entertainer. Besides in­
jecting his effervescent person- i 
ali^y into ehccrleading, lie was a I 
leader In the Science Stag Stunt 
Committee, which gave a stunt 
show every year on “Science Stag 
Night.” It was one of the big­
gest events of the school year.
During Al’s career as a student, 
Spring Carnival took on more of 
thd appearance of a genuine Car­

THE CARNEGIE TAETANTUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 1941

cM nt 6T0BS.T 4L0.FRC
ll, w perhapHa hit unkind to bring up grave matters with final 
o.xfunH _. clone, but Htrange thingK keep popping up at Student 
Council nieetin^H. At the JaHt meeting of Council a propowal was 
inade to set up a publications board to consist of t),ie editor of each 
publication on cniripus pJus the chairman of the publications com­
mittee on Council. Apparently this board ¦would have the power 
to examine everything that went into print and have the right of 
censorship. According to the Student Council minutes, the board 
Would decide what is or what is not fit to print by whether in its 
opinion it “was to the best'interests oi! either the publication con­
cerned or of the school at large.”
Under this new arrangement, if! Student Council sees fit to 
pass it, the editor of the Technical will be telling the TAUT AN 
what to print; the TARTAN will be telling the Thistle what a 
good year book should look like, and the Thistle will be picking 
the jokes for the Scottie. Just exactly what is to be accomplished 
by the editors invading each others’ fields is not quite clear yet. 
Perhaps the proponents of the scheme will bring that out in the 
future discussions.
Student Council tabled the motion at its last meeting, and 
we hope that before the matter is voted upon, it will be given 
serious consideration. One of the peculiar things about the pro­
posal is that it was made by persons who only a short time ago 
strenuously declared themselves against censorship of any kind. 
As far as we are concerned, we have no desire whatsoever to pry 
into the editorial affairs of the Thistle, Technical, or Scottie, and 
it is more than modesty that leads us to believe that they know a 
great deal more about running their particular publication than 
we do.
We have heard hints to the effect that a greater purpose to 
be accomplished by this general board of overseers is the preven­
tion 01: the perpetuation in power of a small group on any publi­
cation. That purpose is laudable, but almost any other way of 
attaining it would be better. The TARTAN staff feels very 
strongly about the matter of control, and we are proud of the 
fact that there is not even the semblance of an organized group 
dictating the policy or the election to positions on the TARTAN
Tf i.......:ination which we Ifope will be continued—a situa-
¦ >ore is no discrimination against any staff member 
or other affiliations.
ed to give this new board power to pass 011 the 
incoming staffs for all publications. In other words such a board' 
could invalidate the choice of the outgoing staff (which is under 
the present setup subject to Student Council approval). Any 
group which controls the board controls every publication on 
campus.
For good oi* ill it is true that some publications are controlled 
by small, organized groups, but the centralization oI! publication's 
is no Way to remedy that situation. As matters stand now, any 
group must “capture” one publication at a time, making the task 
much more difficult. With the institution ol! a board of censorship 
and control, it would be simply necessary for an organized group 
to control a majority of this board in order to control all campus 
publications. Those who are starting with the purpose of doing 
away with minority control are simply making minority control

hast year’s election gave many students cause to hope that, 
campus politics would be .improved, but they are beginning to find 
out I hat by doing away with “Big Three” control they did not 
solve I ho problem of campus politics. Some of the newly elected 
members are so anxious to “do things” that they are succeeding 
in doily* a very botched job. In such a situation it is excusable to

The Wind Blows and Who 
Doesn’t.
When the wind blows, and here 
at Tech it often blows^—and hard, 
too—life in the dormitory becomes 
very improbable, if not impossi­
ble. It’s the doors that are at 
fault. They seem to be made in 
the ration of two-thirds rattle and 
slam to one-third wood. (The 
wood is so old and splintery that 
it is wood only by courtesy—a 
better name would be kindling.) 
You can lock the door and they’ll 
rattle; unlock them and they both 
rattle and slam. And besides the 
windows shake, as Chile shook in 
a recent earthquake.
You can close the window, but 
then you suffocate; you can jam a 
pencil in the door jam, but it be­
comes an expensive remedy when 
your neighbors steal the pencils. 
You can try to ignore the nuisance, 
but just as you are deep in a 
metaphysical oblivion, someone 
will let his door be slammed shut 
by the draft created by an open 
window. If this happened once 
in a while, you might be happy 
by comparing your position to one

body is simply not built to with­
stand the strain.
The only real solution consists 
in striking effectively at the root 
of the evil. Most of the. wind 
emanates from a certain portion of 
the Arts School—I suggest that 
they burn the Little Theater and 
the Dramats with it. Macabre 
solution, perhaps, but, considering 
that it comes from the inflamed 
mind of one driven to frenzy— 
it’s quite practical.

Developing better apparatus of many kinds at lower cost 
is a continuous process in the Bell System. It plays a major 
part in making your telephone service the finest and cheapest 
in the world. Here is one of many cases in point:
Above you see two telephone loading coils—one old, one 
new. Such coils are spaced at regular intervals along tele­
phone circuits. They reduce electrical losses... help to bring 
your voice through clearly, strongly over long distances.
Through the years, engineers at Bell Telephone Labora­
tories have succeeded in making these coils smaller and 
smaller. In so doing, they have greatly reduced the cost per 
coil, which...multiplied bythe millions in use...has helped 
to keep the cost of out-of-town service low.
Why not telephone home at least once a week?
Long Distance rates to most points are lowest 
any night after 7 P. M. and all day Sunday.

drates, of course, had been cre­
ated miraculously out of three 
raw materials: sunlight, C02, and 
water.
It was immediately seen that 
Berl’s theory, if true, would ne­
cessitate the rewriting the 
dictionaries and textbooks of 
chemist r y. Asphalt would 
be a mother, not a derivative of 
oil. Brown coal could not be 
transmitted into bituminous coal. 
Certain coal deposits might have 
been under the exact, proper con­
ditions created a comparatively 
short time ago. Above all, carbo-. 
hydrates would be the main par­
ent material of bituminous coals, 
asphalts, and oil, and could there­
fore be converted under proper 
geochemic conditions into these 
fuels.”

Bulletin Index Names 
Dr. Beri "Man of Year'
Research Professor
Makes Gasoline 
From Molasses
Editors of the Pittsburgh Bulle- 
the Index, following their long­
standing custom of choosing a 
“Man of the Year,” indicated that 
there is indisputably one out­
standing Man of 1940—Berl of 
Pittsburgh.
Before members of the Ameri­
can Chemical Society, meeting at 
Detroit in September, Professor 
Ernst Berl, research professor at 
Carnegie Tech, announced his 
findings on “The Role of Carbo­
hydrates in the Formation of Oil 
and Bituminous Coal.” For the 
first time, man had actually in a 
“rather simple” process lasting an 
hour, created coal coke, asphalt, 
crude oil, and gasoline from car­
bohydrate - containing material 
such as grass, leaves; seaweed, 
wood and molasses.
Although it received very little 
attention in Pittsburgh papers, the 
news made the front pages of 
hundreds of other papers. The 
New York Tribune wrote, “What 
the Wrights did to distance, he 
has done to geologic time. One’s 
imagination gasps at the possibil­
ities.” Qualified chemists ques­
tioned by New York Times man, 
William L. Lawrence, declared 
that the Berl Process was unques­
tionably one of. the major discov­
eries of modern science.
In view of so tremendous a sci­
entific discovery as that of Dr. 
Ernst Berl, the Bulletin Index 
named him the Man of the Year 
of 1940 in Pittsburgh.
In 1914 Berl became Chief 
Chemist of the Austrian-Hungary 
War Ministry, working with ex­
plosives. After the War he re­
ceived a Professorship of Chemi­
cal Technology at the Technical 
Institute of Dormstadt. During his 
fourteen-year stay there, he be­
came known as a top man in the 
field of chemical technology, an­
alytical chemistry, flotation, and 
many others of the chemical 
realm, and as an authority in the 
fields of rayon and activated car­
bon. He was the editor and chief 
author of the great five-volume 
“Chemisch-technische Untersuch- 
ungsmethoden.”
In 1933, after Hitler came to 
power, Dr. Thomas Baker, late 
president of Carnegie Tech, 
brought Dr. Berl, Dr. Otto Stern 
and Dr. Immanuel Estermann to 
Carnegie. At present Mr. Berl is 
a member of two government 
boards—the Seven Man National 
Explosives Advisory Board and 
the National Research Council.

that brown coal and lignite were

Tanks Get Cocky, 
Bombs Inconsiderate
By Saul Moses
The following material was sug­
gested, perhaps more than sug­
gested, by one of the Saturday 
Letters of Raymond E. Manches­
ter,. Dean of Men, Kent State Col­
iege, Kent, Ohio. At occasion, I 
have seen fit to insert “me” into 
the paragraphs.
The trouble with a tank is that 
it doesn’t have brains enough to 
say, “Turn boys, . we’re going 
back,” or “Lafayette, here we 
come,” or “I propose to fight it 
out on this line if it takes all sum­
mer.” It is so dumb and obstin­
ate it Will sit down in the mid­
dle of a field if it bumps its cater­
pillar, and let the war go to heck 
—I say, Hell. Even when London 
Bridge is falling down, it is just 
as likely as not to say, “My car­
buretor doesn’t feel so hot this 
morning, so I guess I’ll lay off to­
day.”
The trouble with a bomb is 
that it is utterly lacking in any 
ability to learn sportsmanship. 
You tell it over and over again 
to be courteous, fair, and consid­
erate, and then when you take it 
up for a nice, long ride and turn 
it loose, what does it do? No one 
can even guess. It may go into 
some lady’s kitchen and bust hell 
out of the place.
The trouble with a plane is that 
it hasn’t emotion enough in its 
soul to rear up on its tail and 
shout, “They shall not pass.” It 
won’t even roar unless you give 
it a big drink of gas and a punch 
in the propellor.
And the trouble with us is— 
well, you know the rest—I haven’t 
got the nerve to say it.

Symphony’s New Works
Dr. Fritz Reiner will conduct 
the Pittsburgh Symphony' Orches­
tra in its eighth pair of concerts 
this Friday evening, and Sunday 
afternoon, at Syria Mosque.
Three works never heal’d be­
fore in Pittsburgh will comprise 
the first half of the program—the 
Prelude to “Irmelin” by the Eng­
lish composer Delius, “Fools Par­
adise” by the Danish composer 
Riisager, and John Carpenter’s 
Symphony. The American-born 
Mr. Carpenter will come to hear 
the performance of this work. The 
second half of the program in­
cludes the colorful Mother Goose 
Suite of Raval and the familiar 
Polovetsian Dances from Boro­
din’s “Prince Igor.”

Fooling the enemy with paint 
was a neat trick in the last war, 
and Mr. Everett Warner of the 
P &’ D Department was just the 
man who could do it. (And did.)
At the time when America was 
getting ready to enter the war in 
behalf of the Allies, Mr. Warner 
was in New York looking for work 
for the summer. He wanted to en­
list in the ambulance corps, but, 
upon approval of a camouflage de­
sign he had submitted, he receiv­
ed a position on the shipping 
board.
The first project in disguising 
a ship was experimentation on a 
plan submitted by the great in­
ventor Thomas A. Edison, known 
as the “Edison Mystery Ship.” 
Experiments were conducted to 
find two colors which at a 
distance would blend into grey. 
Patches of these colors large as 
a room were painted on the ship. 
Then the upper part of the ship 
was covered with canvas to make 
a cigar-shaped appearance, which 
would destroy effectiveness of 
submarine range-finders, since 
range-finding depended upon ver­
tical lines. This required $10,000 
worth of canvas at a time when 
we hadn’t enough canvas for our 
army, and later it was discovered 
the enemy subs had no range-find­
ers in the first place.
Up to this time, camouflaging 
was done in an attempt to conceal 
the ship from the enemy, being 
known as low visibility camou­
flaging. Mr. Warner did not 
think that was the ideal type of 
camouflaging; consequently when 
the Navy decided it was not prac­
tical, he was put in charge of! the 
design section of the Navy 
camouflage department. The staff 
worked on the principle of de­
ception, not concealment. Models 
were used, and designs were 
evolved which made ships appear 
to be broken up, greater' In num­
ber, and appear to be going in 
different directions than they act­
ually were. This confused sub­
marines because they had to ilro 
torpedoes along a “collision- 
course,” that is, since torpedoes

travelled only about 35 knots per 
hour, their course was set so that 
they would collide with the ship 
at some third point. In decep­
tive camouflage the choice of col­
or was of much less Importance 
than formerly.
Despite popular belief, the only 
ships camouflaged wore convoys, 
not battleships. Camouflaging was 
entirely anti-submarine. No cam­
ouflaged transport was ever sunk, 
although three convoys which 
were not camouflaged were 
struck and sunk. One of these 
was the “President Lincoln,” but 
camouflaging would not have sav­
ed it. The sub had found it in 
the dark and followed it all night, 
then at dawn, when the ship was a 
perfect target against the light, 
the sub rose to the surface and 
torpedoed it.
Mr. Warner states that if cam­
ouflaging is used in the present 
war, it will be an entirely new 
process. Formerly the submarine 
was the only real source of 
danger, and as pointed out, de­
ception from the low viewpoint 
of the submarine’s periscope was 
comparatively simple. Today the 
ship must be protected from the 
submarine, the raider, and the 
bomber. The raider and the 
bomber can see the wake of the 
ship, in spite of any camouflag­
ing, and the submarine of today 
has listening devices to detect the 
ships presence. Camouflaging in 
the present and future will prob­
ably be of a temporary nature, 
different in the morning than in 
the evening and night, and capa­
ble of being changed quickly.

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JANUARYi 14, IMI
butterscotch
By Ruth Brodio
Christmas vacation has come 
and gone, leaving us with a com­
pleted term paper and a ct(se of 
galloping laryngitis. We are quite 
fascinated with what we fondly 
call our voice. It comes out unex­
pectedly, in squeaks and wails, 
like a bagpipe. The first day we 
hoped it would stay like that for­
ever, because everyone said we 
sounded like Tallulah Bankhead, 
but the next day it was a lot more • 
like Henry Aldrich, which isn’t 
what you would call glamorous. 
We haven’t done anything for it 
but eat a new kind of cough drop 
which is supposed to paralyze 
your mouth and throat so that 
you can’t cough if you try. All 
they’ve done so far is ruin our 
digestive system—permanently,
we’re afraid.
Comic Strip-Tease 
There isn’t anyone who loves 
the funny papers more than we 
do. We never care if the newsboy 
wiped his shoes with the front 
page—but we go into a tantrum 
if anything happens to the 'comic 
section. These days, however, we 
are getting just a wee bit sick of 
the funnies. Our favorite dumb 
prize-fighter has suddenly and au­
thentically joined the Army. Our 
favorite ingenue and her brother 
have got mixed up with a (lot of 
sinister Oriental stuff. In fact, 
the funny page is so infested with 
spies that we’re afraid it’s going 
to blow up with a loud bang, any 
minute. These spies are terribly 
ingenious, and we have no doubt 
that the Intelligence Departments 
of foreign countries get lots of 
good, practical sabotage ideas 
from such sources as “Captain 
Easy,” “Jane Arden, Girl Report­
er,” and similar patriotic strips.
Having once written a play in 
which ,the protagonist turned 
around and repeated our “mes­
sage” to the audience every time 
there was a lull in the action (and 
believe us, there were plenty of 
lulls), we should be the last to 
talk against propaganda in art. 
But we are naive enough to think 
that stuff that preaches a philoso­
phy of hate shouldn’t be fed to 
children, whether that hate is jus­
tified or not. Let the adults do the 
hating—after a careful consider­
ation of tohy they are hating. If 
there must be bad guys; why 
can’t we go back to Rudolph Ras- 
sendale? He, at least, would, never 
be confused in Junior’s mind 
with the little girl named Shultz 
who sits next to him in spelling 
class. Or in big brother’s pither.
Civilization 
The water in our apartment 
suddenly went oil again the other 
morning, leaving us in the show­
er, soaped, shivering, and bewild­
ered. Our apartment is a big one, 
and the service is generally pret­
ty good. It is, however, a temper­
amental building, and strange 
things happen in it every now 
and then. The water never goes off 
or gets cold except when we are 
taking a shower. The hot water 
faucet in our kitchen is on the 
right, but in the bathroom it’s on 
the left. The light switches all 
say “On” when they’re off and 
“Oil” when they’re on. And the 
fire-engines roar down our drive­
way about once every three weeks.
Not that the place is on fire. 
But the incinerator smokes and 
sometimes the smoke goes into 
the apartment of a man on the 
seventh floor, and he invariably 
calls . the fire department. When 
it first happened, Mother grab­
bed the canary bird and the fam­
ily silverware and raced off down 
the hall. But now we just look 
out the window and say, “Oh, my, 
we’re on fire again.”
There’s a big garage, and they 
service your car there while you 
sleep—if you can manage to, hear­
ing the banging and crashing go­
ing on down in the region of the 
garage. They have a blackboard 
in the garage, on which they write 
what’s to be done every night. Not 
long ago we were going to the 
store (there’s a delicatessen in the 
garage, too) and we saw this ad­
monition to our father written 
there: “Mr. Brodie—wash and
grease!”
Air Waves
We’re definitely not of the 
“what’ll - they - be - thinldng - up- 
next?” school, but we can’t help 
being a little apalled at those new 
portable radios that everyone’s 
carrying around. It’s land of hard 
to get used to hearing “Practice 
Makes Perfect” coming out of 
someone’s hip pocket.
And speaking of radio, the BMI- 
ASCAP feud threatens to out- 
Benny-Allen, Benny and Allen. 
Like the war, it provides excellent 
meat for conversation because 
hardly anyone knows what it’s all 
about. We met a man on the train 
who sat himself down on the seat 
next to us—sitting on our ice- 
skates, too, and engaged us in a 
heated monologue. He kept us 
awake from Altoona to Harris­
burg, and we never found out 
what side he was on. He didn’t 
look like a song-writer, but then 
he didn’t look like a radio execu­
tive, either. As a matter of fact, 
he loolced like the manager of a 
streamline* market. Us, we’re not 
much of an authority. Until about 
a month ago we thought BMI was 
a military school and ASCAP a 
new picture magazine. Now we 
know different, but that’s about 
all. One thing we can say, though, 
and with authority—Stephen Col­
lins Foster is getting in our light 
brown hair.

we have helped to do with light.”
Even at night the 112-foot gal­
lery appears to be bathed in sun­
light. Light from the 33,000 watts 
of electricity is so balanced that 
the intensity on the pictures is 
about eight times more than that 
in the center of the gallery, a ra­
tio that has been found best for 
viewing paintings. So gradual is 
the transition of the light that the 
casual observer does not notice 
the change in intensity.
Some of the fluorescent bulbs 
above the skylight can be turned 
off on bright sunny days, making 
possible a constant lighting both 
day and night. It is this constancy 
of the artificial system which Mr. 
Carter believes makes it superior 
to the varying intensities of day­
light^_______________________________
Dr. Krivobok 
Assumes New Post 
With Lockheed
Dr. Vsevolod Krivobok, profes­
sor in the Department of Metal­
lurgy, resigned from the Carnegie 
faculty to accept the position as 
Director of Research of the Lock­
heed Aircraft Corporation at Bur­
bank, California. His work will 
deal with metals and their appli­
cation to airplane design. At the 
same time, he will do part time 
• teaching at California Institute of 
Technology.
Dr. Krivobok, after graduating 
from the University in Petrograd, 
came to the United States during 
the World War in the diplomatic 
service of the Russian Govern­
ment. After the war he was sent 
back to the U. S. on a commis­
sion in the metallurgical field. 
The revolution overtook Russia, 
and Krivobok stayed in this coun­
try, studying under Dr. Sauveur at 
Harvard, receiving his Sc. D. 
degree from that school..
He came to Carnegie in 1925 as 
assistant professor under Dr. As­
ton. In 1931 he was appointed to 
^prepare for the Campbell Mem­
orial Lecture, one of the highest 
honors that a metallurgist can ob­
tain. Following his lecture, Alle­
gheny Steel Corporation hired him 
as Associate Director of Research 
in charge of the stainless steel 
department. He resigned from all 
other positions, including his vice­
presidency of the Rustless Iron 
Corporation of Baltimore. Since 
that time he has been on a part 
time teaching schedule at Car­
negie, a position which he held 
until recently.
Last summer he was engaged in 
the design of a new laboratory 
at the Lockheed Aircraft Corpora­
tion, Burbank, California.
Dr. Krivobok, one of the fore­
most authorities on stainless steel, 
gave 24 lectures on this subject 
from coast to coast last year.

The new light system com­
bines incandescent bulbs with the 
recently developed fluorescent 
lamps which get their energy from- 
electrical discharges into a mer­
cury vapor. This discharge is ac­
companied by the emission of in­
visible ultra - violet radiation 
which is absorbed by chemicals 
coated on the inside of the tube, 
and reemitted as visible light. This 
light has a spectrum rich in blue- 
greens which combines with the 
red of the incandescent bulbs to 
provide a complete and well-bal­
anced color range.
Equipment for manufacturing 
this indoor sunlight is mounted 
above the skylight of the gallery. 
Through 224 Fresnel lenses, 
mounted flush with the skylight, 
light from incandescent bulbs is 
focused on the pictures, supple­
mented by 680 feet of fluorescent 
tubing mounted behind special 
plate glass panes. This glass, 
which is so strong that a quarter 
inch pane would support a 200- 
pound man, is specially heat- 
treated so that it conducts all col­
ors equally. It has been sand­
blasted on one side to provide the 
proper amount of diffusion.
“By adjusting the angle of the 
lamps and their lenses,” explains 
Mr. Engelken, “we have been able 
to give every painting an equal 
prominenct on the wall. We have 
toned up the dark paintings and 
toned down the brilliant ones, 
simply by adjusting the amount 
of light above them. What the 
artist has done with his pigments,

Balance Spectrum 
To Improve Light
“Artificial illumination better 
than the everchanging daylight” is 
the description Clarence Carter, 
Assistant Professor of Painting 
and Design, and a well known ex­
hibitor, applied to the new $17,- 
000 lighting system installed by 
Carnegie Institute in its perma­
nent collection gallery “A.”
Such famous paintings as 
Claude Monet’s “The Seine at 
Lavacourt,” Ignacio Zuleage’s 
“Castilian Shepherd,” and works 
by Sargent and Anton Maure can 
now be seen for the first time as 
the artists intended them. Shoes 
can now be seen on the figure in 
Whistler’s portrait “Sarasate.” 
whereas, under the old system, the 
legs and feet were invisible in 
the dark background.
Under the direction of Homer 
Saint-Gaudens, director of the 
galleries, and Richard Engelken, 
lighting consultant, engineers from 
the Westinghouse Electric and 
Manufacturing Company designed 
and built the new units, which 
are the first to be used in art 
galleries, to duplicate the sun’s 
spectrum by matched control of 
two artificial light sources. 
Formerly the galleries were il­
luminated by incandescent bulbs, 
some of which were the “daylight” 
type. These bulbs emit a 
spectrum which is predominately 
red, with the result that blues and 
greens appear dull, and yellows 
are distorted.

Gloomy Outlook for Basketballers
For a period of several weeks the Tartan basketball charges 
have been dribbling, passing, and shooting to the best of their 
ability, attempting to chalk up their first win of the season. So 
far all their efforts have been to no avail. The constant reason 
for the regular defeats sustained by the hardwood men of our 
school is that they are playing better teams well stocked with 
playing personnel, possessing basketball ability far above that of 
the average player.It would be well for the entire school to stop and think of 
the athletic condition of our school before charging Max Hannum 
and his boys with gross negligence and a complete lack of the old 
school spirit. The primary reason for the dismal showing pre­
sented to date is that Carnegie Tech (just as if you don’t know) 
does not subsidize athletes. Rube Stark and Jimmy Tumpane 
were the last men to wear the Tartan silks who received any help 
from the school, and at the present time no member of the Skibo 
floor aggregation receives any financial aid from the school. This 
lack of subsidation serves to explain our team’s long string of 
losses when we recall the fact that every squad we have played has 
been bolstered by at least four or five subsidized players.
The future of our team does not hold much in store, for every 
aggregation we are scheduled to meet in the future subsidizes to 
the fullest possible extent. All we can do is support the squad 
with our appearance at the games, and back the team with our 
cheers for baskets scored.
A1 Minetti Night
Tomorrow night between the halves of the Pitt-Tech basket­
ball game, one of the loyal sons of Carnegie will be given a long 
deserved honor—I refer to the Major C award to be given to A1 
Minetti. In the days when A1 led the cheering section no award 
was given to the graduating cheer leaders for their work during 
the season. However; in 1932 Major C awards were given to the 
cheer leaders, and A1 and others went before him were forgotten.
It is only fitting that Tech’s most"prominent figure on the 
football sidelines should be recognized, for to many loyal Carnegie 
rooters, a football game would be nothing without the regular ap­
pearance of the old master after the “We want Al” chant. 
Intramural Facilities Available
For quite some time Mr. Eyman and his Intramural Board 
have been providing all the equipment necessary for the playing 
of such sports as badminton, squash, handball, ping-pong, and 
volley-ball. In addition to these sports regular groups (under 
excellent leadership) are meeting to learn more about boxing, 
wrestling, and tumbling. All that need be done to take advantage 
of any of these facilities, or to enter any one of these groups is to 
appear at the Gym at 4:30, state your request, and prepare for 
action.
Swimmers Start Season
Last Saturday, the Skibo swimmers opened their season by 
losing to Penn State in the victor’s pool. Despite the severe loss 
of man power suffered by the splashers after last year’s successful 
season, the Tartan natators are looking forward toward many of 
their future meets with victory as their ultimate goal.

Tartan Quint Runs 
Streak To 8 Losses
Among the gridiron heroes of 
Carnegie Tech is massive and 
likeable George Muha. For the 
last four years he has stood but 
on the playing field as one of 
the most dependable and hardest 
working players on the squad. 
Many times his vicious tackling 
and hard running has proved the 
backbone of the Tech attack.
It all started five years ago 
when George entered school in the 
fall of 1936. Not long after his 
arrival there was no* question in 
the minds of the students that 
some day George was to make his 
contribution to Tech football. Dur­
ing his Sophomore year while 
playing in a practice game he met 
with an accident that give him a 
broken leg and a rest for the re­
mainder of the season. This mis­
fortune kept George out of school 
for quite a while and made it nec­
essary for him to attend school 
five years to obtain his degree of 
Bachelor* of Science from the 
Department of Management En-

gineering. In the fall of 1938 all 
of us cannot help but remember 
the touchdown twins, Muha and 
Condit. We all remember how 
George did his part in defeating 
Pittsburgh’s Dream Team 20-10, 
and how such worthy opponents 
as Holy Cross and Notre Dame 
fell before the Tech attack. Dur­
ing that same year George car­
ried the brunt of the running as 
Tech battled Texas Christian Uni­
versity in the Sugar Bowl. That 
year the Sugar Bowl contest over­
shadowed the Rose Bowl classic in 
national popularity and strength 
of competing teams. Again in 1939 
the team of Muha and Condit 
sparked the running of the Tech 
squad, and these two became 
known as two of the hardest run­
ning back in the country.
Although George had not finish­
ed his college education the fall 
of 1940 found him doubtful of re­
turning to school. For a few 
weeks in the summer he had been 
the guest of the New York Giants 
and had been offered a contract. 
However, George finally decided to 
return to Carnegie and finish his 
school work, and also to play 
football. After a not too success­
ful season George received rec­
ognition for his football prowess 
in the bid to play in the annual 
East-West Charity game. Play­
ing with such notables as Har­
mon of Michigan and Reagan of 
Penn, George turned in a com­
mendable performance in his 
twenty-four minutes of playing 
time. It is not a wonder we say, 
“Hats Off to. George Muha.”
West Virginia 
Dukes, W. & J. 
Notch Victories
Carnegie Tech’s basketball for­
tunes sank to a new low during 
the past week.as the Tartans drop­
ped three more contests to run 
their current losing streak to eight 
straight.
Monday night found the hap­
less Scots dropping a 59-45 deci­
sion to West Virginia’s smooth 
quintet. Very much in the game 
at the half, the home guards saw 
the gap in the score widen as the 
Mountaineer’s flashy forward, 
Jimmy Ruch began dumping in 
almost impossible shots as the 
game drew to a close. The Ski- 
bo’s sad record at the foul line 
was a big factor in their downfall, 
no less than 14 charity tosses out 
of 27 being missed. Leading scor­
ers for the losers were .Captain 
Red Burch and “Wild Man” Brinn 
who tallied 11 markers apiece, but 
the stars of the fray were the 
aforementioned Mr. Ruch who 
hung up 19 points and Scotty 
Hamilton who acted as field gen­
eral for the victors.
Wednesday proved the blackest 
day in the history of Tech basket­
ball, as the Plaid absorbed a hu­
miliating 46-9 trouncing in Du- 
quesne’s cigar-box gym. Add the
W. A. A. sports continue in full 
swing throughout the winter, and 
it is up to all of you to take ad­
vantage of them. The Badminton 
club is starting a tournament in 
which all the club members will 
participate. A game is scheduled 
with Pitt to be played sometime 
in February, and the games for 
the rest of the year can be planned 
when the schedule for next se­
mester is worked out.
All bowlers should be bowling 
their six lines sometime in the 
near future. This is one of the 
best advantages offered by the W. 
A. A., and one of the topmost rank­
ing sports among the girls. The 
alleys are very accommodating 
and seem to enjoy the company
smooth working of one of the 
country’s top teams to the list­
less ‘play of the Tartans, who were 
beaten before they stepped on the 
court, and you will have just 
about have the story told by the 
lop-sided score. Rudy Debnar 
who starred under the basket, and 
“Milky” Milkovitch with his set 
shots from the middle of the court 
proved the shining lights for the 
Dukes. Red Burch and Herb 
Neiderberger were “high” scorers 
for Tech with one fleld goal 
apiece.
Eighth Loss to W & J 
Coming back fighting on Sat­
urday night, the Skibos made the 
crack quintet of Washington & 
Jefferson go the limit to notch their 
seventh straight victory. But it 
was just defeat number eight to 
the Locals as the W & J forwards 
Tirdick and.Reese poured in fleld 
goals in the waning moments to 
increase the President’s lead. Herb 
Neiderberger sparked the Tartans 
as the game opened when he ran 
rings around the W & J defense, 
and the Plaid got off to an 1,1-6 
lead. But the visitors soon found 
the range and went out in front 
where they stayed for the remain­
der of the fracas. Again it was 
poor work on the foul tosses that 
spelled defeat for the Scots. Each 
team tallied 16 fleld goals, but the 
Presidents dropped in 19 free 
throws as compared with only 
seven for the Tartans.
of the Tech gals, so do take the 
opportunity and finish out the 
six lines sometime before the first 
week in February.
Dance Club gave an excellent 
exhibition several weeks ago, all 
of which goes to show what comes 
of .their practice. The fact that 
this organization is so successful 
in both interest and results of their 
work makes the board feel that 
there is something to be gained 
by having clubs, and there is talk 
of forming clubs for the various 
sports, making the organization 
more definite and possibly more 
attractive to the W. A. gOAH We’ll 
see and tell you more about it 
after your heads come up from 
exams . . . then you’ll be ready 
to listen.
Water Contest Not 
Decided Until Final 
Event In Opener
15y Joe Thomas
Last Saturday afternoon, the 
Carnegie swimming team opened 
the current season at State Col­
lege against the powerful Penn 
State tankers. The Carnegie 
splashers were very much out­
classed in several events,’ but the 
meet was not decided until the 
final event—the 400 yard relay. 
Tech won three first places when 
Captain Bill Molvie won the 100 
sprint, Frank Martin won the 
backstroke, and Bob Boehmig took 
the 440. The Lion mermen won 
all the other events and badly 
outdistanced the Tartans in both 
the medley and free style relays.
Captain Bill Kirkpatrick broke 
xhis own Penn State record in the 
50 yard sprint with a good 24.4 
performance, one-tenth of a sec­
ond under the record. Bun Tur- 
nock of Carnegie bettered his 
own time in two events, cutting 
one second from his 220 time and 
eight seconds from his .440 rec­
ord.
Althought Tech had the best 
team hist year in the recent his­
tory of the school, all, these men 
men were lost by graduation 
with the exception of the present 
captain, Bill Molvie. Coach Al­
len E. Risedorph has practically 
started from scratch this year and, 
althought it is still early in the 
season, he will undoubtedly make 
the best of the available material. 
Coach Risedorph is again president 
of the Eastern Collegiate Swim­
ming Association and starting his 
fourteenth year as mentor of the 
Tartan tank team.
In the meet last Saturday, Tech 
won three out of the nine events. 
The 300 yard medley was won by 
State with Webb, Roisman, and 
Bogatin. The 220 was won by 
Delmanx.O of State with Boehmig 
taking third in this event. Cap­
tain Kirkpltrick of State set a 
record by winning the 50, be­
ing followed by our local Bill Mol­
vie. In the fancy diving event, 
Smith and Brown took second ancl 
third respectively for Tech. State 
won the 200 breaststroke and fin­
ished by taking the 400 yard re­
lay easily.
Students Should 
Take Advantage of 
Facilities OlTered
It is the writer’s opinion that 
the bulk of the student body has 
not taken the time to find out 
about the many sports and con­
tests that are being provided for 
everyone by the Carnegie Intra­
mural Board. More and more 
facilities for the student's athletic 
pleasure have been obtained for 
use; and Mr. Eyman, Head of In­
tramural Activties, has spent 
hours of time in securing informa­
tion from other school’s programs 
in order to devise the best plan 
of application for the Tech stu­
dents. Althought examinations 
will slow up participation during 
the next few weeks there is no 
reason why all of us cannot enjoy 
the opportunities provided.
Instruction in Wrestling and 
Boxing, is at your disposal, and a 
plan for team entries has been or­
ganized. Playing-space and equip­
ment for Badminton, Squash, 
Handball and Volleyball, can be 
obtained upon request. Yester­
day was the closing date for team 
entries in these sports, but time 
extensions may be made if ex­
pedient.
One of the newest ideas of the 
Intramural Board is the starting 
of a Managers Club. This or­
ganization would be made up of 
managers of all the teams entered 
in intramural competition. The 
purpose would be to provide a 
meeting ground where managers 
could comment on referees, play­
ing rules, complaints, and in other 
ways become an advisory commit­
tee for the Intramural Board.

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 1941
Defense Program 
Causes Alterations 
In Parking Status
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Students Must 
Obtain Stickers 
For Admission
One of the oldest bugs in com­
ing to Evening School has again 
arisen, P-A-R-K-I-N-G. For 
years those attending late classes 
could never find adequate park­
ing facilities. Now additional 1500 
National Defense Students, who 
get here for 6:30 classes, have 
taken possession of the- best park­
ing areas.
In order to somewhat alleviate 
this new situation the institute 
has set aside the parking areas 
behind Machinery Hall and En­
gineering Hall for the use of the 
regularly registered Evening Stu­
dents.
Admission to the restricted 
parking areas will be gained on­
ly by the display of the Special 
Parking sticker on your car. The 
stickers can be obtained at the 
registrar’s office and will be pre­
sented to only those regularly reg­
istered Evening Students upon 
presentation of their registration 
cards.
For the mutual benefit of all 
those privileged to have use of 
the restricted areas, you are re­
quested to cooperate in every way 
with the parking guards and at­
tendants. Enter the driveways 
slowly and pause long enough in 
order to let the attendant ob­
serve your stickers. The sticker 
should be placed on the driver’s 
side of the car on the side win­
dow. Care should be taken that 
you do, not block driveways and 
leave room for free passage of 
other cars to and from the drive­
ways.
The parking areas along Frew 
Street, Margaret Morrison Street, 
and the large field behind the 
girls’ dormitories on Margaret 
Morrison Street are open to all 
.students including those taking 
the defense courses. Those stu­
dents parking along Frew Street 
are requested to park perpendic­
ular to the wall and in between 
the yollow lines and not on them.

Our rambling reporter tells us 
that Mr. Steve Marcinizyn, the 
former President of Student 
Council, has gone in for high 
finance in a big way. At least he 
seems to be having a lot of 
trouble keeping his accounts 
straight. Is it money trouble or 
“gal” trouble Stevie?
We’ve heard a lot of tall tales 
in our day, but the best one is the 
one about a fellow on the Plaid 
Stall who can see snow even on 
the clearest nights. At least, he 
sees it when he looks across 
Forbes Street. Better put your 
glasses back on Hal.
We know at least two night' 
students who are working on 
formulas at home now, but they’re 
not the kind you get in chemis­
try class. You get these from the 
Doctor along with the “blessed 
event.” How about it Russ and 
Wes?
Arnold (the commuter) Anex 
and his gal friend were at the En­
gineers’ dance, but who wasn’t? 
Even J. (Bluebeard) Miller was 
there, as were Robert C. (for 
Casanova) King and his gal. 
Among the missing were: Thomas 
(from Irwinway) Savage, Mr. & 
Mrs. Russ Lahr, and Mr. & Mrs. 
Wesley Berkoben.
This national defense program 
is causing trouble for more peo­
ple than Hitler. It’s easier to park 
at home and walk to school than 
it is to find a parking place here. 
But that’s all going to be changed 
we hope. Still, I can’t understand 
how they’re going to put about 500 
more cars in a space too small for 
the ones originally parked there.
We’ve made one resolution for 
the year—to out Winchcll Winch- 
oll, if we can.
Dr. Mr. Editor:
Article IV, Section 2 of the Con­
stitution of the Evening Student 
Council states, quote: It shall be 
the duty of the Council to pub­
lish notice of all actions affect­
ing the entire Evening Student 
Body in the College Papers after 
such actions are taken.
The first semester is just about 
over and to this date no news of 
Council has been published in 
your paper. Has Council accomp­
lished anything this year affect­
ing the entire student body this 
year besides holding the usual 
dances?
An Evening Student. 
Editor’s Note:
In past years council has al­
ways appointed one of its mem-
bers as council’s correspondent 
for the Plaid. It is the duty of this 
person to send to the Plaid all the 
information about the council 
meetings. So far we have receiv­
ed no such correspondent, and 
therefore, it has been impossible 
for us publish any “Council 
Notes.”
In all fairness to council how­
ever, we must point out the fol­
lowing facts.
New members of council do not 
take office until the first meeting 
in November. At this time the 
vice president, secretary and trea­
surer of council are elected. 
Council’s correspondent was not 
appointed until the first of De­
cember, and since that time only 
one meeting was held, the minutes 
of which appear below.
STUDENT COUNCIL NOTES
Evening Student Council ac­
cepted with reluctance the resig­
nation of John Leister, Treasurer 
College of Engineering. At the 
time of his nomination, Mr. Leis­
ter explained that he was taking 
three hours a week at Tech and 
nine hours of the C. A. A. course. 
Whether or not credit was given 
for the C. A. A. course was not 
known at the time,, und Mr. Leis­
ter was elected under these con­
ditions. It was recently learned 
through Dr. Warden’s office that
C. I. T. gives no credit for the
C. A. A. course and Mr. Leister 
resigned from Council. Council 
gave Mr. Leister a vote of thanks 
for his splendid co-operation, dur­
ing his stay in office. The remain-
ing Engineers Officers have not 
as yet proposed a new candidate.
Council received notice from the 
Administration that Mr. Peter 
Rollinger, president of the Col­
lege of Industries was ineligible 
and as a result Council asked for 
his withdrawal. The vacancy was 
filled by Edward Tiepel who re­
linquished his office of Vice-Presi­
dent to assume the office of Presi­
dent. The Vice-presidency was 
filled by Stanley Stolarczyk on the 
recommendation of the remain­
ing officers of the College of In­
dustries. This choice was approv­
ed by council.
The remaining time was taken 
up with the usual routine busi­
ness.
FRATERNITY NOTES
The Nu Sigma Alpha Honorary 
Fraternity held its 12th annual 
dinner dance on Saturday Decem­
ber 18, 1940. The affair was held 
at The Lodge in South Park.
An appetizing dinner of baked 
ham, candied sweet potatoes, 
fruit cocktail, peas, coffee, rolls, 
cake and ice cream, was enjoyed 
by those who attended the affair.
After dinner, lively dance 
rhythms were furnished by Fred­
dy Ellrod and his orchestra._______
This year’s dance was charac­
terized by the renewal of old ac­
quaintances between some of the 
older members of the fraternity.
The officers of the fraternity 
consist of John Thomas, Precep­
tor; James A. Miller, Mentor; 
Steve Marcinizyn, Recorder; Har­
old Parks, Warden; and the mem­
bership committee, including 
Harold Geilman, Robert B. 
Thompson.

coming to a close and we have 
been asked by the administration 
to remind you that final exam pe­
riod begins January 17 and con­
tinues through to January 24. 
Consult the schedule on the bul­
letin boards for the time and place 
of your individual exams.
Immediately following the ex­
ams comes Registration period on 
Monday and Tuesday, January 27

Yuleticle Ball 
By Engineers 
Huge Success
¦S— eETCUS— LNEVU 
uKFE—.U O3ACJ 
,— wEK aSTB.N
Did you swing and sway the 
Palmer way at the Engineers An­
nual Christmas Dance held in the 
gym on December 21? For many 
years this dance has been one of 
the high lights on the social cal­
endar, and every one who ever 
attended the Christmas Ball 
knows that it is one dance that 
folks attend and talk about till 
time for the dance next year.
Don Palmer’s orchestra sup­
plied the rhythm and sweet swing 
music that everyone from the jit­
terbugs to the Engineers enjoyed. 
Medleys of old tunes that all en­
joy were heard from time to time. 
Featured with the orchestra were 
Kay Denton as vocalist, Larry 
Miller and his electric guitar, Bob 
Stewart, the drummer who sings 
as a pastime, and the Saxofour, 
consisting of Don Palmer with 
three of his band.
Decorations reflected the Yule 
spirit and were very appropriate 
with icicles hanging from the 
doorway, snow sprinkled about 
the gym, and Christmas trees in 
all the cornex-s. One thing that 
made this dance a hit for the 
bashful boys was the encourage­
ment of the mistletoe. Nothing 
like an excuse to give the tim­
id fellow a little encouragement.
Girls seemed to have the much 
discussed problem settled because 
most of them had on long dresses. 
Corsages were given to the first 
two hundred young ladies who 
attended, and many Yule time 
toasts were given downstairs at 
the “Black Cat,” which was al­
so decorated in the Yule time 
spirit.
The Engineers were honored by 
the presence of Miss Yon and 
Dr. Beryl Warden who acted as 
chaperons.

To the keen interest of the 
thousands of men and women who 
visit our Chesterfield factories, we 
owe the idea of publishing the book, 
“TOBACCOLAND, U. S. A.” It is a 
comprehensive picture story about 
the growing, curing and processing 
of tobacco, telling you why Chester­
fields are MILDER, COOLER-SMOKING and 
BETTER-TASTING.
We are proud of the hundreds of letters 
from smokers like yourself who have seen “TOBAC­
CO I. AND, U. S, A. ” Many have asked us to 
copies to their friends. We would take pleasure 
in sending you a copy—just mail your request to

Music Supplied 
By Efldie Weitz 
For Annual Event
Evening Student Council h4ld 
their annual Post Holiday Dance 
in Thistle Hall last Saturday 
evening, from nine until twelve 
o’clock.
Music for the affair was fur­
nished by Eddie Weitz and his 
Pennsylvanians. His “Music You 
Remember” will long remain in 
the minds of those who attended. 
There was a little difficulty about 
just who would play for the dance 
but Mr. Weitz won.
Clyde Knight and his. orches­
tra, who was originally contract­
ed for the dance, found out that 
they had other connections which 
they couldn’t break and Mr. Gum- 
mo, the social chairman was for­
tunate enough to secure the serv­
ices of Mr. Weitz.
Thistle Hall was decorated in 
the traditional holiday manner 
with the good old crystal ball 
hanging in its usual place, and 
the spots of light whirling gaily 
about the ceiling.
Beautiful corsages were given 
to the first 200 girls to arrive in 
the traditional Tech manner, and 
the gentlemen received pro­
grams in return for the $1.00 ad­
mission fee.
During the intermission and be­
tween dances, those who desired 
refreshments made their way 
down to the Black Cat Room. The 
smoke was as thick as the friends 
who met there, and no one seemed 
to mind if the room was a little 
crowded.
On the list of those invited to 
the dance were:. Mr. Peter H. Al- 
lemano, Dr.. Edward B. Baker, Mr. 
and Mrs. Robert E. Doherty, Mr. 
Lawrence R. Guild, Mr. and Mi's. 
Dalziel McKelway, Mr. and Mrs. 
Beryl E. Warden, Mr. Willibald 
Trinlcs and Mr. Kent Shaffer.
The dance was in charge of Jo­
seph Gummo, Social Chairman, 
and Lou Fosner, Assistant Social 
Chairman.
