Party at Schenley Theater in 
Former Years — To be 
Costume Dance Similar 
to Mardi Gras.
.ALLEGHENY NIGHT
It has been a custom in past years 
on the night of the Alleghenw game, 
a theater party has been held in the 
.Schenley Theater. A play was usua- 
ly staged by the drama students.
This year a big Hallowe’en cos­
tume dance will be held in the foyer 
of the Arts Building. This is to be 
a four school affair similar to the 
Mardi Gras, of Campus Week. All 
students and alumni of Allegheny 
College and “Tech" are invited.
This is the first big dance of the 
year and is an opportunity to have 
an unusual good! time. The cos­
tumes need not he elaborate, some­
thing of the spirit of Hallowe’en. 
The building will be decorated in 
Iteeping with the occasion and should 
be a pleasant place to dance.
Favors consisting of horns and 
-other novelties will be given out; 
•also refreshments will be served. 
Hughes’ Collegiate Six will .furnish 
the music.
Tickets are being sold on the 
cam/pus this week.
DRAMA STUDENTS OF
TECH EXHIBIT MODELS
In addition to being the opening 
night of the Tech Arts Theater 1921- 
22 season, the night of October 12. 
also was marked by the opening of 
an unusually striking exhibition of a 
stage setting models in the foyer of 
the College of Fine Arts. The models 
shown were, for the most part, ex­
ecuted under the direction of Alexan­
der Wyclcoff, Art Director of the The­
ater, and constitute what is prob­
ably the most unique exhibit held 
in the annals of this institution.
Models one, two, three and four, of 
Maeterlinck’s “Death of Tantagiles," 
are by David Mudgett and are deftly 
treated with consistent imagination. 
To quote from the catalogue of the 
exhibition:
“The idea in mind is to provide a 
setting that by feeling and atmos­
phere assists in the action of the 
play, and in each act to provide a 
suitable sym<bol of this action.
“Just as Richard Wagner in his 
operas carried through them a defi­
nite ‘leit-motif’ which was symbolic 
of certain emotions and characters, 
so the designer of these settings has 
adopted a ‘form-motif’ which recurs 
in each scene. This type of setting 
is called by its designer “impression­
istic symbolism/’ and is one phase of 
the much talked of ‘new movement in 
the ¿heater.’ ”
In addition to these models, Mr. 
Mudgett lias also in the exhibit a 
setting for the harlequinade. “The 
Wonder Hat,” which, with its vivid 
coloring and composition, /brings to 
mind the paintings of Maxfield Par­
rish.
A large model, representing a 
Louis XVI Court Masque, is by Fred­
erick Jones III, and exhibits in a 
pleasing manner the' costumes of the 
period by James Reynolds, who is 
responsible for the Russian and Per­
sian costumes in the Greenwich Vil­
lage Follies seen here lately, and 
in the latest Ziegfeld Follies for the 
"Cyclamen Tree,” and “The Birth­
day of the Dauphin.” The sketches 
on exhibition are some of the orig­
inals for the last named scene.
Lawrence Paquin exhibits an inter­
esting, colorful scene in a Spanish 
courtyard. The cool patio in the fore­
ground, the brighter walled-in garden 
with its barred gate, and the distant 
city against a tropic sky give an ef­
fect of infinite distance which is ex­
actly suited to the play for which 
it is intended, “Malvaloca.”

SENIOR C0UNCIL0R- 
FRESHMEN SUPPER
The Senior Councilors of the men’s 
schools met with their Freshmen 
groups at a supper in the Tech cafe­
teria on Tuesday evening last. After 
the discussions among the individual 
groups, Bill Pfouts was introduced as 
the speaker of the evening. Bill gave 
a “man-sized” talk on things vital 
to Tech, which was greatly appre­
ciated by all who head it.
Secretary R. J. Davis, of the Tech 
Y. M. C. A., had charge of the meet­
ing and announced that these Coun- 
cilor-Freslimen suppers would be held 
in the cafeteria on the third Tues­
day of each month.
We urge that all Seniors make a 
real effort to keep in touch with their 
Freshmen groups, so that these sup­
pers may be as well attended and as 
helpful to both Seniors and Freshmen 
as was the first one, held on the day 
of registration.

Charles F. Bowers, secretary.
The other members of the cabinet 
will serve as ichairmen of the vari­
ous committees which carny on the 
work of the organization
Mr. Arthur Rugh who has been a 
figure of international prominence 
in Y. M. ¡C. A. work for many years 
was present at this organization 
meeting. He gave a very helpful 
talk on the essential features of a 
newly organized Y. M. C. A. branch 
and also told of conditions in China 
where he has directed this work for 
many year3.
R. O. T. C. REPORTS
W. & J. GAME BY WIRELESS
At 7 o’clock on the morning of the 
W. & J. gome a convoy of R. O. T. 
C. trunks, under the command of 
Capit... Walker., started for Little 
Washington. Arriving there about 
eleven o’clock they proceeded, after 
a brief rest, to College Field, where 
they set up the radio apparatus. From 
there reports of the game were flash­
ed to the Union and the Westing- 
house receiving station.
Those students who were unable to 
attend the game received a detailed 
report of the play in the Union a few 
minutes after it was made.
From the Westinghouse station the 
reports of the game were transmit­
ted by powerful wireless phones to 
all parts of the country and to the 
leading newspapers.
The R. O. T. C. is to be commended 
for the efficient manner injwhich it 
handled the reports of the game and 
also for the spirit it has shown in 
serving the interests of Tech and 
the student body in general.
MACKRELL SPEAKS
TO CITMAS CLUB
Joseph Mackrell, former candidate 
for mayor of Pittsburgh, spoke to the 
Tech Masons of the Citmas Club last 
Thursday evening. He discussed 
Masonic clubs and the work of fra­
ternity in the state of Pennsylvania. 
Following this talk music was fur­
nished by the Musical Clubs -Novelty 
Orchestra. A two-reel movie comedy 
was enjoyed in conjunction with the 
jazz which certainly was there Re­
freshments and smokes also 6erved 
to make the evening a pleasure not 
iioon to be forgotten.
PHYSICISTS 
MEET WED.
Progress of Physical Science 
Discussed—Noted Speak­
ers on Program
DR. RITTMANN SPEAKS
It may not be generally known 
among those who have recently come 
to the campus that there is a weekly 
meeting in the Science Building, de­
voted to the study of the progress of 
physical science. These meetings 
are held every Wednesday afternoon 
at 4:30 p. m. in Room 113. The sub­
jects and speakers are announced on 
the Physics bulletin board and also 
on the enclosed bulletin board on the 
first floor of the Science Building. 
The first meeting of the present sem­
ester was held on September 21. 
Professor T. C. MacKay gave a brief 
review of some, recent physical liter­
ature. Professor H. S. ITowe/ gave 
items of news regarding physicists 
and described some of the laborato­
ries that he had visited in his recent 
trip to Europe. Among distinguished 
scientists whom he met were Trav­
ers, distinguished for his work in rare 
gases in conjunction with Sir William 
Ramsey; Turner, the eminent Eng­
lish glass technologist, and Von Laue, 
the great German theoretical. physi­
cist.
On September 28 Dr. R,lttman de­
scribed an ingenious method of meas­
uring the velocity pressure of hot 
oil. In his introduction hq expressed 
his conviction that physics, is the 
basis of everything. He then showed 
how small pressure indications may’ 
be magnified several ilines as com­
pared with the simple water or oil 
gauge. He referred also to the groat 
commercial importance of recent 
methods in the heat treatment of 
crude oil. Mr. C. Williamson describ­
ed at the same mooting a method 
used recently in Germany for test­
ing photographic lenses for sphorlcal 
aberration.
On October 6 Mr. E. M. Pugh de­
scribed an extension of the use of 
the McLeod gauge for measuring very 
low pressures. The moasuromont of 
low pressures had recently assumed 
additional Importance on account of 
the widespread uso of thermionic

SMOKER TO BE HELD 
BY MUSICAL CLUBS
Extensive preparations are being 
made for the annual Musical Clubs 
Smoker, the date of which will be 
announced In next week's Tartan. It 
is hoped that this smoker will prove 
to be the best function of this na­
ture held on the campus for some 
time and everyone is urged to take 
some part in the fun. As usual, the 
season's stunt numbers will J)e tried 
out at this time and any member of 
the club who thinks he has any new 
brilliant ideas for making people 
laugh are ask-d to share his ideas 
with either Tourcette in the Glee 
Club or Kovach iu the Mandolin Club 
so that this idea may be put to good 
use.
Also members are urged to work up 
stunts to present at this time. The i 
Musical Clubs Novelty Orchestra, 
which by the way, has changed its 
name to All-Tech Novelty Orchestra, I 
has been working hard and will be 
presented to the cluhs at this time. 
From all reports it will spring a sur­
prise as it is developing into the best 
orchestra on the campus. The “Nig* 
Igors’’ from- Alabama will also bo 
there to sing a few and pull a few.
Both clubs are beginning , to show 
some wonderful pre-season form, al­
though the Gleu club is weak In first 
tenors. If there are any Carusos who 
have thus far not reported to the 
largest non-athlotlc activity at Tech 
they are bid to make their appear­
ance at the Exhibition Hall in the 
College of Fine Arts Sunday aftor- 
noon at 2:30 p. m.

PROPOSED SCHEME FOR GYM
Sketches for the new gymnasium 
are being made by Mr. Hornbostel 
and his assistants. The scheme 
which is now being studied will he 
a building of several stories In front, 
and possibly a* single story which 
Includes the gymnasium proper. Al­
so a swimming pool adjacent to the 
main building which will be open 
air, and surrounded by a court. The 
idea is to make the now structure a 
place that can be enjoyed by all 
students not, chiefly for the athletes.
The corner land adjoining the art 
school where the present open air 
theater is located is being strongly 
considered as the site. However, no 
definite information as to design on 
location can be secured at this 
time.
It may not be generally known 
amongMthose who have recently come 
to tho’camp*Mn that thore Is a weokly

announced ea '^tho Physics bullotln 
board and also on the onclosod bullo­
tln. board on the first floor of the 
Science Building. The first mooting 
of the present semester was hold on 
September 21. Professor MacKay 
gave a brief roviow of somo rocont 
physical lltorature. Professor Ilowor 
gave items of nows regarding physi­
cists and described some of the lab­
oratories ho had viH'Itod In his rocont

with the simple water or oil gauge. 
He showed also the great commercial 
importance of recent methods in the 
heat treatments of oil. Mr. C. Wil­
liamson described a method recently 
used in Germany for testing photo­
graphic lenses for spherical aberra­
tion.
On October 5th Mr. E. M. Pugh de­
scribed an extension of the use of 
the McLeod gauge for measuring very 
low pressures. The measurement of 
low pressures has recently assumed 
additional importance on account of 
the -widespread use of thermionic 
vacuum tubes. Mr. P. C. Crago dis­
cussed Langmuir’s most recent the­
ory of types of valence. This subject 
is being studied eagerly by both 
physicists and chemists.
On Wednesday, October 12, at 4:30 
p. m., Professor J. B. Nathanson 
spoke on the scattering of alpha par­
ticles by the atomic nucleus. All in­
terested are cordially invited to at­
tend these meetings.
Intelligence tosts have been In use 
at Tech for sevoral years. They 
have been given to all freshmen and 
at times to other groups. Some facts 
about these tests might, be of intorost 
to the stuaonts.
A psychological examination differs 
from a regular school test or exam­
ination in that It does not. aim to tost 
the student’s knowledge of any partic­
ular subjoct. Its pitrposo Is rather 
to determine his mental alertness. 
Most of tho material In tho tost must 
be novel. The examination which 
has boon used most determines the 
student’s ability1 to perform simple 
logical operations., his ability to get 
tho moaning of written statements, 
and his range of interest and Infor­
mation In matters of everyday Impor­
tance. The ability to answer ques­
tions of this typo quickly and accur­
ately distinguishes tho bright student 
from tho poor student..
Probably you havo all thotight that 
tho questions In tho tosts woro simple 
and have said that you could havo 
usnworod nearly all of them if you 
could have boon given moro tlmo. 
But the main purpoi-o of tho tost Is 
to 8oo how quickly and accurately 
you work.
Tost scores are a good, although 
not a porfoct, Indication of tho sort 
of work a student will do In school. 
This dors not moan tluit the student 
who makes a high tost score will 
mako a largo number of quality 
.. ir^'onnd that the students who
.........*•' >w on the tost will bo ollm-
lnuu :.-• '•• scholarship. Tho rea­
son that a s?u£(?.', score In the Intel­
ligence tost Is not a 
of tho kind or work he will do In 
school is not hard to find. Wo all 
know that intelligence Is not tho 
only element which determines schol­
arship, Health, preparation, porso- 
vorance, attitude toward work, and 
many other t'actorh play their part.

ASSEMBLIES 
HEAR SEC.
Dr. Baker Discusses Con­
ference to Be Held 
at Princeton
Dr. Balcor spolco last Wodnonday 
boforo tho Engineering and industries 
Assemblies in regard to tho confer­
ence of roproMontntivoB of tho Eastern 
colleges to he held at Princeton Uni­
versity this wcolc to discuss the lim­
itation of armaments. Dr. Baker 
omphnsl'/.od the value of such a moot­
ing as a means of oxl.ondlng among 
students a knowledge of some of tho 
questions that will ho considered by 
tho Washington conference In No­
vember. Ho roferrod to the Presi­
dent’s desire that, tho public should
prose: out of the question,
but that thoro Is u possibility that 
something may he accomplished to­
wards limiting the sl/.e of armies and 
navies.
The reduction of military estab­
lishments means diminishing the 
dangers of war. There Is also a real 
«danger of the financial breakdown of 
Europo. All tho nations of Eu­
rope are being taxed beyond their 
powers. France Is maintaining an 
army of noarly six hundred thousand 
men and a considerable navy, Eng­
land Is herself beyond the limits of 
endurance to pay the debts of the 
war and to maintain and expand her 
navy. In I,lie meantime II, Is Impossi­
ble for the United States to collect 
the debt of nearly ton billion dollars 
which tho European countries owe. 
Under those conditions It Is the ob­
vious thing that somo attempt should 
be made to reduce the governmental 
expenses in ordor that a. rational 
economic condition may he restored 
In Europe. It Is certainly no tlmo to 
expand the military establishments of 
the different countries.
With rogard to tho question of the 
possibility of war between Japan and 
the United States Dr. Balcor said that 
a conflict between those two coun­
tries is held to be inovitablo by 
nearly everyone In Europo. It was 
the opinion of the speaker that this 
danger is being greatly exaggerated. 
The threat of a "yellow peril” can 
only bo serious if Japan is allowed

THUNDERBOLT MODERN PLAY
The second production of tho year 
in the Arts Theater will be “The 
Thunderbolt,” Pinero’s episode In the 
life of a Provincial family, under tho 
personal direction of Mr. Chester 
Wallace. This play will bo produced 
In Its entirety with new scenery and 
modern costumes. After last year’s 
vari&d season of costume and fantas­
tic plays It seems well1 fitting to pre­
sent so early In the year a good mod­
em play.
The story is a clever re-writing of 
the old plot of the lost will, Peculiarly 
Pinero’s is the ability to make such 
a hackneyed idea fresh and interest­
ing, and we hope that with the able 
direction of Mr. Wallace the perform­
ance will be well worth while. Tho 
four acts contain crisp comedy linos, 
and dramatic suspense and tension Is 
freely distributed throughout.
Productions of Mr. Wallace during 
the past two years, "The Three of 
Us,” “Furrowed Earth," “Tho Cas- 
siills Engagement,” show very well 
his Interesting touch In the modern 
play. Following up the splendid ar­
ray of signs which now apponr be- 
for tho doors of tho theater, a beau­
tiful S, It. O. sign Is now being com­
pleted to bo framed In similar manner 
to the “no standing” sign, arid to be 
used during the run of “Tho Thunder­
bolt.”
Performances aro scheduled for 
tho nights of November 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
Dates for tho following week have not 
been announced as yet.

the Thistle to start taking the Indi­
vidual pictures of the Seniors this, 
week. The pictures are to he taken 
at the studios of W. O. Breckon,

charge of tho Margaret Morrison 
school; P. C. Ganfaon in Science, 
K. W. Finlay in Industries and C. E. 
Landefold In Arts.
Mr. Breckon does a very high class 
of work and It is only at some ex­
pense to the staff that his services 
havo been secured. Tho students 
should therefore make It a point to 
look tholr very host In order that tho 
Thistlo as well ar# tho photographer 
may present the portraits In the host 
possible manner. In years previous 
the studio has lmd a little troublo 
with a few of the students Interfer­
ing with tho, rogular work of tho 
photographer, In a few Instances 
photographs and expensive frames 
havo disappeared from his studio. 
Much, actions aro not expected from.; 
this year’s Senior Class.

Happenings on the Campus
SELECTING CHEER LEADERS
One oJ! the biggest jobs on the campus is that oi: Head Cheer 
Leader /The man to illl the job must be well grounded in the ihm- 
dam/ /s oi: choqr leading, in the movement and rhythm of liis arms 
an<?' fy. He must have a clear insight into these tilings and have* 
tlu /ity to cxecute them. This is the first requirement of a cheer 
-1 c /and it can be acquired through practice. The other qualities 
iu-e not so easily acquired, that is, the ability to read the mob’s mind 
during every tense or disgruntled moment that is common to follow­
ers of an athletic team; the instinct to do the right tiling at the right 
time.
Men, in the outside world, holding such jobs, -which entail such 
training, experience and ability are not there solely because of their/ 
popularity or because it was the choice ol! the mob at the moment. 
They are there because' there is no one able to handle the job better.
The system -ol! selecting cheer loaders by popular vote at Car­
negie Tech is wrong. Does Coach Stell'en aslc Science School or Arts 
School to elect men for tho football team? Some football team we’d 
have. Does the student body elect men to tho Musical Clubs? Not 
by any means. II; is the practice oi! the Musical Clubs, first, io try 
the man out, ii! he shows ability he is put playing a minor part. If 
ho develops ho is given a more prominent part and il! he is better 
than the rest ho docs solo work or assists in tho directing. Would 
oi; a similar practice produce hotter cheer leaders and insure tho 
uality of choor leading from year to year?
Give the job of cheer leador, not to tiro most popular man, but 
i tho best man and you will have the best cheer leader. This plan is 
only worth tryiiig, hut justifies itself by tho success of similar

A WORD FROM THE PRESIDENT
Octobor 17, 1921.
In* TOditor of tho Tartan, C. I. T., Sir:
would deeply appreeiato it if you would allow mo tho spaco 
the following:
' iamerschlag aecompnnied me to 'Washington, Pa,, to ott 
I game, anil we were both impressed and gratified that in 
1:1! defeat the students of this institution gave such a splon- 
rition ol! Fair and sportsmanlike expression in their conduct, 
oring and their singing, both be!!orc the touchdowns and 
f) disastrous end.
> are most fortunate in having a team that knows how to play fixe gentlemen during every moment of tho contest, to accept 
/is. and go on to tho end with determination. We are equally 
finite in having a coach whoso public expression appearing in 
V^oss commands our respect because of the dignified and intolli- 
V lit acceptance of defeat with consideration of all tho factors 
involved.
Our institution is milking progress. It is reaping tho results of 
patient and careful development, and tho President takes this op­
portunity of congratulating the football team and all those asso­
ciated with tho recent contest on the best public exhibition of the 
highest ideals of college spirit which has come to his attention in a 
decade.
Yours very truly,
ARTHUR A. HAMERSCHLAG,
President.

was not Quite as well attended as 
the previous ones this year. Carl 
Held presided. Treasurer Illgbberger 
reported; the receipt of $15.00 from the 
Student Senate, making ' a total of 
$115.15 in the school. treasury. Presi­
dent WIHiard of the Student Senate, 
announced that'all those who had ap­
plied for exemption from Plebe reg­
ulations could secure their cards from 
him. He also read the recommenda­
tions passed by the Student Senate 
on Octobor 14, governing the con­
duct of Plebe trials.
William Btlrke, Senior Class presi­
dent, was appointed as general chair­
man of the annual Arts ball, which is 
to be held February 17, 1022. Tho 
rest of the committee will be appoint­
ed during the present week. Plans 
for the ball will get under way at 
once—the type of ball to be decided 
at the next meeting.
Vincent Roy, Sophomore Class pres­
ident, invited everybody of Arts to 
attend the Soph dance to be given by 
that das» on Friday the 28th in the 
Foyer. An Arts registration card is 
the price of admission.
ARTS SOPH DANCE
Nearly everybody in Arts is going 
to tlie dance to be given by the Soph­
omore class Friday night, the 28th. 
It Ib in honor of the Plebos and the 
Upper classmen are going to turn 
out and show the "little ones" a good 
time. "The Collegiate Six,” alias 
"Tech Jazz Band,” "Artistech,” "Eve 
Hughes' Orchestra,” and "Hughes” 
Jazz,” have been engaged to start at 
8:15 because they must stop at 11:45. 
It doesn’t cost a cent and if your "In­
finity” doesn’t have a red registration 
card, just bring lyour own—that's all. 
And don’t dress up, for it’s not a mas­
querade party, as announced in last 
week’s Tartan. So come a-runnin\
MID-WESTERN ASSOCIATION
THANKSGIVING DINNER
there. If wo can judge a person by 
liIs handshake, we are compelled 
to say that tho Class of ”25 will pull 
through, for they sure have some 
grip.
An address of welcome was extend­
ed to the Plebes by Jack Hanna, the 
Soph president, and Moessner, the 
Plebe president, responded heartily. 
After that, an entertainment of a 
very varied nature was given, mixed 
in with some real good advice by 
Prof. Hower, who represented the 
faculty, and a talk on Tech traditions 
by C. A. Blench.
Later on in the evening-, refresh­
ments were served, and each member 
of the Class of '25 was given a chance 
to show how good a Tartan he was 
on the plder keg. They’re human all 
right, for one innocent looking Plebe 
was heard to say, "Gee, I don't be­
lieve it has a bit of kick.”
The committee in charge of the 
smoker was composed of Foster, 
Ryan, Shucker and Hollingsworth.

In order to bring about a better 
co-operation and) a closer relation­

held last night in tble gymnasium by 
the Industries Freshmen.
The recently organized Plebe jazz 
orchestra, consisting of Barr, Rucken-

furnished some fine music for the oc­
casion. Some one hundred Plebes 
and Federal Board men were present 
and spent the evening in getting ac­
quainted.

HENDERSON HALL TO
HAVE A CLUBROOM
At a mooting held Octobor 12, Pres­
ident Anderson of Hondoraon Hall, 
announced that Doan Tarbell bad 
agreed to furnish tho material for a 
elubrooml provided the men would 
supply tiie labor. This proposition 
was unanimously accepted and work 
on converting tho two basement 
rooms into a suitable club room will 
start immediately.
This will fill a long-felt want of 
Henderson Hall, as heretofore there 
has been no suitable place for gath­
erings or for general recreation.
Tentative plans were also adopted 
for an all-dormitory dance to. be held 
November 4.
PROF. HOWER TALKS
AT SCIENCE SMOKER
Last Friday night will surely be 
remembered by the undergraduates 
of the Science School, for all who at­
tended the Soph-Plebe Smoker cer­
tainly learned something fine. A bet­
ter spirit of friendship could hardly 
have been shown between the two 
classes, Sophs and Plebes mixing in 
a true spirit of fellowship. It wasn’t 
advisable for anybody with a weak 
hand to attend that smoker, for there 
certainly were some firm handshakes
It will be of interest to the student 
body in general to learn the ^financial 
side of the benefjts obtained by stu­
dents who are taking the four year 
R. O. T. C. course. During the four 
years students are furnished free of 
cost with the necessary uniforms-" 1 
equipment. After they have ompleted 
the first two years’ course and sign 
the contract for the'second two years, 
in addition to the clothing allowance 
they are given cash monthly payment 
by the government Whiclu is the same 
as commutation of rations granted to 
soldiers in tho service. The number 
of men in the second year course this 
year is naturally larger than during 
the last year’s work. The estimated 
payroll tills year is as follows:
Amount required for stu­
dents for first quarter
i. e., up to September 30,
1021 ...............................$895..G0
Estimate for payroll for 
Bocond quarter, due De­
cember 30, 1021............<1142.88
Estimate for payroll for 
third quarter, duo March
30, 1022 .........................3505.GO
Estimate for payroll for 
fourth quarter, due Juno 
30, 1022 .........................352Q.40
So that the total amount that will 
be paid in cash to tho studonts of tho 
Senior and Junior classes onorllod in 
the R. O. T. C. this year will amount 
to $12,154.48, This is a good illus­
tration of the advantages obtained by 
the studonts talcing the whole four 
years’ course in the R. O. T. C., since 
this payment of money is in addition 
to the practical training that they 
receive, and the probable commission 
in the Reserve Corps that will be pre­
sented upon graduation.

every college man considering the 
question of disarmament, not from a 
sentimental point of view, but from 
the standpoint that a normal course 
of world affairs could only be re­
stored by reducing the governmental

be considered should be that of arm­

FRIENDLINESS
The excellent spirit displayed by the Tech rooters at last Saturday’s 
game, when the Pitt-Syracuse score was announced deserves commendation. 
The frieifdly feeling between Tech and Pitt is growing and it is quite to the 
credit of Tech, their outbursts of enthusiasm, when it was announced the 
Panther eleven was leading.

THE BAND TO PENN STATE
When the Plaid eleven runs out on the Penn-State gridiron, a week from 
Saturday, they will be greeted by the music of the Tech band, fifty strong.
The band is to make the trip on the "lech Special” and upon its arrival 
will compete with one of the best college bands in the country, as Penn State 
takes great pride in producing this organization.
Tech has no reason to fear this Competition, the Carnegie band is equally 
as good as any student organization in any college, everyone who heard them 
play at Washington will verify this.

THANKS
Spectators at the Tech-W. & J. game could not fall to notice the excellent 
condition of the gridiron, at College Field. Although the Tech field is not 
as well covered with grass as the Washington field, £lie gridiron is far su­
perior to l&st year’s.
Many thanks are due Park Commissioner Burke for his generosity in al­
lowing sod to be taken from Flagstaff hill to improve the Tech gridiron, and 
this opportunity is taken to extend the thanks of the Carnegie student body.
HOCKEY
With the approach of cold weather, hockey enthusiasts begin to think 
about the formation of a Tech seven to represent the Plaid on the ice.
Initial steps in this direction have already been taken, and a meeting 
of "prospective candidates for the team been held. Quite a number of men 
who have played hockey, put in appearance and Coach Larry McCormick, 
the Pittsburgh Athletic Association star, spoke on the possibilities of making 
a better team than represented Tech on the rink last year.
Another meeting of candidates will be held in the near future and men 
interested, who have not yet signed up, are urged to be present and help 
produce the best hockey team in Techfs history.

HOME COOKING 
Mother does the baking.BECAUSE we put the utmost quality into 
this one brand. Camels are as good as it’s 
possible for skill, money and lifelong knowledge 
of fine tobaccos to make a cigarette.
Nothing is too good for Camels. And bear 
this in mind! Everything is done to make 
Camels the best cigarette it’s possible to buy. 
Nothing is done simply for show.
Take the Camel package for instance. It’s the 
most perfect packing science can devise to pro­
tect cigarettes and keep them fresh. Heavy 
paper—secure foil wrapping—revenue stamp 
to seal the fold and make the package, air-tight. 
But there’s nothing flashy about it. You’ll find 
no extra wrappers. No frills or furbelows.
Such things do not improve the smoke any 
more than premiums or coupons. And remember 
—you must pay their extra cost or get lowered 
quality. &
If you want the smoothest, mellowest, mildest 
cigarette you can imagine—and one entirely free 
from cigaretty aftertaste,
It’s Camels for you.
