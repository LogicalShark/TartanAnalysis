Carnegie Mellon Libraries enforces food restrictions 
School of Computer Science announces new AI speci?c major 
Craig St. book shop responsible for theft
VALENE MEZMIN
Editor-in-Chief
Starting Sept. 10, 
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity Libraries will be en-
forcing new food policies 
across all campus library 
locations. Changes to 
the libraries’ food poli-
cies have been gradual, 
starting with last year’s 
food restriction on Hunt 
Library’s fourth floor to 
protect the artifacts in 
the Fine and Rare Books 
Room. However, a survey 
sent out to the commu-
nity indicated the need 
to expand food restric-
tions to other floors and 
locations.
Shannon Riffe, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Di-
rector of Marketing and 
Communications, ex-
plains that feedback was 
varied, with about half of 
the respondents support-
ing further restrictions 
while the other half didn’t 
want any change. “Those 
survey results, coupled 
with what we were expe-
riencing in the libraries 
prompted us to re-evalu-
ate our food policy,” said 
Riffe.
As more and more 
students have taken 
advantage of the univer-
sity’s library services over 
the past ten years, Riffe 
notes that staff members 
have observed an increase 
in vermin, food spillage, 
overfull trashcans, and 
complaints from patrons 
and employees. Although 
snacks and covered bev-
erages are still allowed in 
many locations, limiting 
full meals from students 
will ultimately decrease 
the volume of food and 
the resulting trash and 
and uninvited critters 
that staff members and 
other patrons have to deal 
with. Students who are 
caught violating this new 
policy will be asked to 
move to another floor or 
area to finish their meal.
These new restrictions 
are focused primarily 
on protecting the librar-
ies’ collection of books 
while being more lenient 
in areas without books 
“such as the basement 
of Hunt and the collab-
orative work area in Sor-
rells,” explains Riffe. For

Every juicy heist movie 
has an equally juicy target. 
Though the quarry may be 
jewels or cash or art, the 
location of the crime seems 
always to be some osten-
tatious locale, dripping in 
gold trim that requires the 
thieves to be dressed to the 
nines in order to blend in.
The Carnegie Library 
of Pittsburgh, though cer-
tainly a lovely building, 
does not match up to this 
expectation. Library pa-
trons at the main branch 
in Oakland are largely stu-
dents, working people, and 
families that seek a quiet 
refuge where they can get 
work done or pass the time. 
However, the Carnegie 
Library of Pittsburgh and 
Caliban Book Shop, a 
bookstore located almost 
across the street from the 
library, served as the stag-
ing area for what the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette called 
“one of the largest library 
thefts in history.”
The books were 
discovered to be missing 
in a 2017 audit. The over 
300 books that had dis-
appeared or been cut up 
were estimated to be worth 
around 8 million dollars. 
Works ran the gamut from 
a rare copy of Newton’s 
Principia Mathematica, 
to a first edition of Adam 
Smith’s Wealth of Nations,

Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity’s School of Computer 
Science announced that a 
new arti?cial intelligence 
(AI)  major will be launched 
this year, the ?rst under-
graduate major speci?c to 
AI among United States 
universities.
The unprecedented 
move was in response to 
the rapid growth of arti?-
cial intelligence in the ?eld 
of computer science, as 
well as the ways in which 
the study of computer sci-
ence has shaped Carnegie 
Mellon, from the work of 
Allen Newell and Herbert 
A. Simon in the 1950s, all 
the way to today, where the 
School of Computer Science 
is considered one of the best 
programs in the country.
Andrew Moore, Dean 
of the School of Computer 
Science, explained in a press 
release that “Carnegie Mel-
lon has an unmatched depth 
of expertise in AI, making us 
uniquely quali?ed to address 
this need for graduates who 
understand how the power 
of AI can be leveraged to 
help people,” showing clear 
optimism in the program.
Students in the School of 
Computer Science will have 
the choice to declare a major 
in arti?cial intelligence after 
the conclusion of their ?rst 
year. 
Dean Moore expects the 
arti?cial intelligence ma-
jor to start small right now, 
with around 35 students 
per class and around 100 
students total in the pro-
gram, but he told Forbes in 
an interview on the new ma-
jor that he expects growth 
in response predicted 
demand, noting that the 
main thing inhibiting 
untethered growth of the 
department and major in 
the future is the lack of 
“physical space on campus, 
especially dorm rooms,” not 
a lack of quali?ed faculty or 
candidates.
As for what the actual 
major will consist of, stu-
dents will have to take a 
comprehensive array of 
math, core computer sci-
ence, and core AI subject 
classes, as well as one 
class in ethics and one in 
cognitive psychology, Dean 
Moore told Forbes.
Many of those familiar 
with computer science know 
that with advancements in 
arti?cial intelligence, pro-
found ethical issues and 
implications arise. In an 
interview with The Tartan, 
Dean Moore said that “we 
need SCS graduates to be 
schooled in how to perform 
their own ethical thinking 
about whole new [classes] 
of unforeseen issues that 
will arise for them during 
their jobs.”
Future students in the 
arti?cial intelligence major 
will have ethical training to 
a degree — though it is only 
one class. They can choose 
between Professor Jen Keat-
ing and Professor Illah Nour-
bakhsh’s “AI and Humanity,” 
Professor David Danks’ “AI 
and Humanity and Society,” 
or Professor Jim Herbsleb’s 
“Ethics and Policy Issues in 
Computing,” Moore told The 
Tartan.
The creation of a 
permanent major in arti?cial 
intelligence may come as a 
surprise to some, especially 
those who view AI research 
as something that follows 
public and scienti?c popular-
ity fads, waxing and waning 
in response to the progress 
being made in the feild.
To this, Dean Moore 
told The Tartan that the 
computer science depart-
ment “expect[s] a backlash 
against the discipline as the 
realization dawns that excit-
ing as AI is, it is not magic, 
but simply a toolbox of the-
ory and techniques to simu-
late intelligent behavior.”
He, however, believes 
that AI is here to stay. He 
states, “it really is differ-
ent this time; as a purely 
engineering discipline you 
can use tools from AI (per-
ception, learning, decision-
making and actuation) in 
all the major industrial ver-
ticals with great impact.” 
What can be done right now 
given the current state of AI 
technology, rather than past 
theoreticals on what will be 
done in the future, is what 
separates the present from 
the past, Moore noted.
The major in arti?cial 
intelligence in the School 
of Computer Science has al-
ready attracted the attention 
of Bloomberg, Forbes, and 
CNET, among others, with-
out even having students en-
tered in the program yet. Op-
portunistic or not, Carnegie 
Mellon University has the 
distinct claim of being the 
only United States university 
with a major in arti?cial 
intelligence.
Dean Moore concluded 
his statements with The 
Tartan stating that those 
most bene?cial to AI proj-
ects he’s worked on are those 
who have been “exposed to 
the physics of perception, the 
mathematics of statistical 
learning, the systems issues 
of cloud and edge compute, 
and the theory of computer 
science.” With this major, he 
says, “this is a chance to be 
one of those people!”

a report from the 1870s 
titled Reports of the Inspec-
tors of Mines of the Anthra-
cite Coal Regions of Pennsyl-
vania, suffragist Elizabeth 
Cady Staton’s autobiogra-
phy, and rare 16th century 
Bibles.
Library archivist Greg 
Piore was arrested in mid-
July, along with co-owner 
of the Caliban Book Shop, 
John Shulman, after being 
charged with criminal con-
spiracy and theft. Piore had 
been smuggling the books 
to Shulman since the mid 
1990s, after which, accord-
ing to The New York Times, 
Shulman would pay Piore 
upfront and sell the books 
to rare book collectors. The 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
reported that Piore would 
drop items off at Caliban 
Book Shop on his way home, 
transporting pages from 
books that he had cut up in 
manila folders or sometimes 
simply rolling them up in 
bigger items.
The pair stopped stealing 
books in 2016 after hav-
ing heard that the audit 
would take place, and Piore 
was ?red in 2017 after the 
audit. Both men turned 
themselves in in July, and 
a preliminary hearing on 
Aug. 1 determined that 
Shulman could continue to 
pay the expenses of Caliban 
Book Shop, though neither 
Shulman nor his wife and 
co-owner of Caliban Book 
Shop, Emily Hetzel, would 
be allowed to pro?t from the 
enterprise.
Though the Carnegie 
Library exists in stark con-
trast to the highly forti?ed 
treasury building, gaudy ca-
sino, or billionaire’s mansion 
guarded by lasers that the 
scale of this theft may evoke, 
this crime spurred attention 
and national coverage due 
to its novelty. The Carnegie 
Library of Pittsburgh, and 
libraries in general, seem 
almost sacrosanct, perhaps 
due to the forced quietude or 
the stone walls or maybe the 
idea that knowledge should 
be accessible to the public 
for free. The fact that the 
person charged with caring 
for these books violated this 
trust for personal gain made 
the story surprising to many 
who may have not though 
of libraries as repositories of 
wealth. But then again, this 
is a crime that was carried 
out in a library named for a 
man who was once the rich-
est man in the United States, 
in a room full of expensive 
books locked away from the 
public eye.
In the aftermath of this 
affair, both the Carnegie 
Library and Caliban Book 
Shop will keep functioning, 
though millions of dollars 
worth of books remain miss-
ing. Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents have already started 
to return to both institutions 
in preparation for a year 
where their main concerns 
about expensive books will 
probably be directed at those 
of the textbook variety.

Carnegie Mellon University’s 2018 undergraduate 
orientation kicks off on Sunday, Aug. 19, and continues 
throughout the week until the following Sunday, Aug. 26, 
the day before classes of?cially begin.
The Orientation schedule is over?owing with activities 
for students of any background and of all different interests. 
With the theme “Dare to Discover,” orientation introduces 
incoming ?rst-years to Carnegie Mellon’s campus and com-
munity, while providing opportunities to engage in academ-
ic, extracurricular, and community activities.
                                  Academics
During the week, each college has dictated time slots 
during which students can seek walk-in advising and ask 
any questions they may have.
On Tuesday afternoon, there will be several informa-
tional sessions about many academic opportunities of-
fered on campus. For example, students can learn about 
the interdisciplinary collaboration IDeATe (Integrative 
Design, Arts and Technology) network at the IDeATe Infor-
mation Session and Tour of Maker Facilities (2-2:30 p.m.) 
or learn about the CMU Washington Semester Program 
(3-3:50 p.m.).
On Wednesday evening, each college hosts dinner and 
evening activities from 4:30 p.m. to midnight. After noon, 
students will bus to different locations around Pittsburgh. 
BXA Intercollege Degree Program and College of Fine Arts 
students will go to the Children’s Museum; College of En-
gineering students will enjoy an evening of laser tag at 
Zone28; Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences 
students will visit the Heinz History Center; Mellon Col-
lege of Science students will explore the Carnegie Science 
Center; School of Computer Science students will tour the 
Google Pittsburgh Of?ces; and Tepper School of Business 
students will attend a reception at PNC Bank’s Headquarters 
and visit attractions in downtown Pittsburgh.
Academic Orientation is scheduled on Thursday 
(8:30 a.m.- 4 p.m.), when students will have the opportunity 
to meet deans, professors, advisors, and learn about 
courses and expectations. This is followed by Convocation 
(5-6:10 p.m.) on the College of Fine Arts Lawn.
                              Extracurriculars
As a university, Carnegie Mellon offers a wide vari-
ety of extracurriculars. On Tuesday, join the Mindfulness 
Room Open House (2-3:50 p.m.) to learn about this inno-
vative opportunity to relax and cultivate wellness through 
dog therapy. There will also be sessions about service and 
civic engagement on campus (3-3:50 p.m.) and Greek 
Life (3-3:50 p.m.).
On Friday from 1 to 4 p.m., the Club Sports Showcase 
will take place on The Cut, where students can try out dif-
ferent sports such as quidditch, lacrosse, and fencing. On 
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, there will also be religious 
events hosted by various religious organizations on campus.
                                    Community
Some of the highlights of orientation are focused on 
building strong bonds between incoming ?rst-years. At 
Playfair (Monday, 8-9:30 p.m.), called “the largest icebreak-
er ever!” students are encouraged to meet as many people 
they can in the class of 2022+. On Tuesday at 10:30 a.m., 
late Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture 
will be shown in McConomy Auditorium, followed by a time 
for discussion. Later that evening, students will take their 
class photo on the Baker Hall Lawn.
Often many students’ favorite event, Casino Night, is held 
on Thursday evening (8:30 p.m.-midnight), when students 
get to dress up for the week’s biggest social event with food, 
dancing, and table games. On Friday night (7-9:30 p.m.), 
students will compete in House Wars in their house colors 
and themes for the coveted Carnegie Cup. The First-Year 
Showcase will begin at 8 p.m. on Saturday evening. Audi-
tions and rehearsals are scheduled throughout the week to 
select the chosen few to perform for the class.
Highlights of “Dare to Discover” 2018 orientation events
example, “while the first 
floor of Hunt houses our 
reference collection, the 
Maggie Murph café is a 
great amenity for our visi-
tors, so it made sense to 
continue to allow meals 
there.”
By doing their part in 
complying with these new 
rules, students will help 
to ensure we “maintain a 
comfortable, clean envi-
ronment for our patrons 
and preserve our collec-
tions,” says Riffe.
The new policy can be 
accessed online at https://
www.library.cmu.edu/
about/food. Students are 
invited to let the university 
know what they think of 
these new policies by vis-
iting http://www.library.

First years: You control your college experiences, so make them positive
MADELINE KIM
Picture this: it’s 2 a.m. 
and you’re scrolling through 
Instagram. Your best friend 
from home is grinning wide-
ly with his new girlfriend he 
met at rush. The girl who sits 
next to you in 3-D calc took 
an impromptu visit back 
home over the three-day 
weekend while you’re trying 
to map out how to juggle the 
assessments your professors 
conveniently saved for that 
weekend. Sure, you realize 
that nobody lives a perfect 
life and has their fair share 
of struggles, but it can get 
difficult to realize that the 
image that they present is 
not necessarily the full pic-
ture.
I don’t say this to sound 
like a grouchy suburban par-
ent (no offense to suburban 
parents) who believes that 
technology is the downfall 
of this generation. I say this 
to remind first years that 
your college experience is 
just that: yours. It’s unique 
to you, and while you have 
people who share this jour-
ney with you, ultimately it is 
you paving the road ahead. 
It’s you who gets to have 
the ultimate say in what you 
want out of it.
That’s not to say you 
should completely put up 
your blinders and ignore 
the world around you. Of 
course, be cognizant of 
things like events, grades, 
and career fairs. However, 
do not expect college to be 
like high school. As cliche as 
it is, it’s true; you were a big 
fish in a small pond. In col-
lege; you’re one of many big 
fishes in a great lake. Sure, 
you didn’t go through high 
school effortlessly. You obvi-
ously fought tooth and nail 
to get to earn a spot at one of 
the most prestigious univer-
sities in the world. However, 
college is a different boss to 
defeat. Being at the top of 
the class, earning honors, 
and balancing several extra-
curricular activities won’t 
be a “duh” thing. That very 
balance might not even be 
attainable. Find something 
that works for you. This is 
easier for me to put these 
words on this page than is 
for you to actually go out 
and find it. It might take a 
while; I’m entering my third 
year and am still finessing 
my schedule. Some people 
find these well over gradua-
tion. Again, go at your own 
pace.
On the tangent of high 
school, some friendships 
can fray. Even after trying to 
keep in touch, relationships 
can end and “best friends 
forever” can falter. That 
doesn’t devalue the time you 
spent with them in the past. 
If that does happen, cherish 
the memories but let your 
heart and our mind open up 
for new ones. Good friends 
might not come your way 
immediately, but if you keep 
doing what you love (or, at 
least, trying to find it), they 
will come.
Don’t be afraid to reach 
out to friends. Again, an-
other cliche, but you’d be 
surprised that the kid who 
sits next to you in lecture 
who seems to get whatever 
is being furiously scribbled 
on the chalkboard is just as 
clueless as you are. Happi-
ness doesn’t always lie in cer-
tainty where the destination 
is in clear sight; sometimes, 
happiness lies in the process 
of fumbling in the dark. The 
journey may end up being 
more important than the 
ending. Have a goal, but 
don’t get tunnel vision to the 
extent that you cut out any-
thing that lies between you 
and that ending.
“Self-care” isn’t self-in-
dulgence; it’s responsibility. 
As hard as it is to find a well-
balanced meal on campus, 
find something more nutri-
tious than fries and Coke 
for lunch. Know where the 
University Health Services 
and Counseling and Psycho-
logical Services are and how 
to schedule an appointment. 
Learn how to contact Title 
IX and save the emergency 
phone numbers you got dur-
ing O-Week in your phone. 
Don’t get sucked into believ-
ing that you need to cut sleep 
in order to be a good student 
(and on that tangent, caf-
feine is not a substitute for 
getting adequate sleep). Get 
some fresh air; living exclu-
sively inside Gates without 
seeing the light of day isn’t 
healthy.
Chances are, you’ll hear 
the phrase “fun dies at Carn-
egie Mellon” at least once 
before you graduate. Some-
times, that phrase seems 
true (read: late-night ses-
sions in the Underground, 
crying over 15-112, and eat-
ing an Ultimate Brownie). 
However, these upcoming 
four years will fly by just 
as quickly as the past four 
years have. Let yourself 
have bubble tea afternoons 
with friends. Rent a projec-
tor from Hunt and put on a 
cheesy movie. Give yourself 
something to look forward 
to. There’s so much waiting 
ahead.

Ocasio-Cortez must debate to depolarize political climate
MADELINE KIM
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 
seemed to have emerged 
out of nowhere. She defied 
odds by winning the Demo-
cratic primary in the 14th 
congressional district, replac-
ing Democratic Caucus Chair 
Joe Crowley. Ocasio-Cortez, 
an outspoken 28-year-old La-
tina woman, stands tall and 
echoes the new direction of 
the Democratic Party: abol-
ishing the U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE), raising the hourly 
minimum wage to $15, and 
having Medicare for all, to in-
clude a few. This captured the 
interest of many across the 
nation, leading to her being 
deemed as the “future of the 
Democratic Party” by Demo-
cratic National Committee 
(DNC) leader Tom Perez.
If she truly is the so-called 
“new face,” we have a reason 
for concern regardless of our 
respective political stanc-
es. Recently, Ben Shapiro, 
famous conservative com-
mentator and editor-in-chief 
of The Daily Wire, challenged 
Ocasio-Cortez to a debate. “I 
would love to have a real con-
versation about the issues.” 
He addressed that he under-
stands why Ocasio-Cortez 
Shapiro may be hesitant to 
debate, but he offered to give 
$10,000 to her campaign for 
an hour debate on his show. 
He ended the request by say-
ing that he wants to “make 
America a more civil and 
interesting place.”
Her response? “Just like 
catcalling, I don’t owe a re-
sponse to unsolicited re-
quests from men with bad 
intentions. And also like cat-
calling, for some reason they 
feel entitled to one.”
Shapiro is famous for 
saying “facts don’t care about 
your feelings,” and this is tru-
ly the case in this scenario. 
Facts don’t care about where 
you lie on the political 
spectrum, but facts do care to 
show that this is yet another 
example of political dialogue 
further shutting down. Re-
gardless of your views on 
either Ocasio-Cortez or Sha-
piro, the fact that the “future 
of the Democratic Party” in-
sinuates that a man initiating 
a woman to debate is morally 
equivalent to “catcalling”is 
troublesome.
Perhaps I’m naive in 
believing that Shapiro 
wouldn’t challenge Ocasio-
Cortez if she were male; 
however, Ocasio-Cortez 
used Shapiro’s sex to insinu-
ate that she is a victim. By 
labeling him as a man “with 
bad intentions” and as mor-
ally devoid as a catcaller, 
she shut down any chance 
of dialogue. However, she 
has yet to respond to debate 
requests from female conser-
vative commentators. I want 
to believe that she is too busy 
to check Twitter, studying 
up on the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict in light of her recent 
PBS interview with Marga-
ret Hoover or improving her 
campaign and looking for 
outlets where she can reso-
nate her message to voters. 
Realistically, however, if she 
saw Shapiro’s tweet and the 
several people tagging her, 
she most likely saw at least 
one of many debate requests 
and is not putting debates 
very high on her campaign 
to-do list.
Perhaps this sort of 
response appears to be justi-
fied given that Trump and his 
administration gets to avoid 
giving clear answers by call-
ing off the liberal “fake news” 
media bluff. Of course, that 
lack of transparency and de-
flection is also harmful to 
our country and its political 
climate. However, regardless 
of whether there is a worse 
bluffing in the White House 
or not, her response — and 
the respective support she 
received consequently — 
further reinforces this new 
norm that we are enabling.
Former President Barack 
Obama garnered attention 
by telling a passionate rally 
quote “Don’t boo; vote!” 
Additionally, former presi-
dential candidate Bernie 
Sanders showed great op-
position against banning 
controversial speakers, such 
as Ann Coulter, from univer-
sity campuses, encouraging 
opponents to argue her in-
stead of silencing her. When 
thinking about contempo-
rary progressive politicians, 
Obama and Sanders are 
among the first to come up 
in people’s heads. This was 
the image that portions of 
the Democratic Party have 
attempted to illustrate to its 
voting base, and we are tak-
ing a sharp turn by showing 
the same voting base that it’s 
okay to demonize those who 
challenge our views.
There are some possible 
factors leading to Ocasio-
Cortez not taking up 
Shapiro’s debate: one being 
the debate is hosted by Sha-
piro himself. Because the 
debate would take place on 
Shapiro’s show, the respec-
tive audience would largely 
consist of Shapiro support-
ers. Therefore, it makes sense 
that being on his show prob-
ably may not have been the 
most fruitful use of her time 
regardless of the monetary 
gain from the debate. How-
ever, her response did not 
just shut off her willingness 
to debate with Shapiro; her 
response shut off her willing-
ness to debate, period. Ad-
ditionally, if it was just the 
fact that she did not want to 
be on the Ben Shapiro show, 
she would not have ignored 
the other requests from 
conservative voices.
Another reason that she 
may not be willing to debate 
lies in the strength of her cam-
paign, or lack thereof. Politi-
co, a political fact-checker, 
has repeatedly disproven sev-
eral of her claims. The Wash-
ington Post went so far as to 
even award one of her claims 
“Three [out of Four] Pinoc-
chios” due to how misleading 
her claim on Medicare was. 
Her PBS interview with Mar-
garet Hoover didn’t help her 
image, especially when she 
backpedaled her claim that 
Palestine is being “occupied” 
by claiming that she is “not 
the expert on geopolitics on 
this issue”. More likely, Oc-
asio-Cortez is not ready to 
enter the political scene, es-
pecially when she blames the 
criticism raised from fact-
checkers on sexism.
Ocasio-Cortez cannot have 
her “I won’t debate you” cake 
and eat it, too. Conserva-
tive commentator Allie Beth 
Stuckey had challenged Oc-
asio-Cortez, which had not 
warranted a response. How-
ever, a satirical interview that 
she posted resulted in Oca-
sio-Cortez speedily tweet-
ing that “Republicans are 
so scared of me that they’re 
faking videos and present-
ing them as real on Facebook 
because they can’t deal with 
reality anymore.” How long 
did it take to respond to the 
satirical video? One day. The 
debate request? We’ve yet to 
find out.
I want Ocasio-Cortez to 
succeed. I want to see strong 
progressive leaders who fight 
for socioeconomic equal-
ity and bring up policies that 
protect Americans’ right to 
chase life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. Howev-
er, I do not think that, at least 
at this moment, she is in a po-
sition to represent Americans 
or even the Democratic Party. 
In such a politically hostile 
climate, it pains for me to see 
another political actor enter-
ing the scene and adding an-
other layer of polarization. 
She had opportunities to pull 
in new voters and challenge 
opposing viewpoints, but it 
appears yet again that we are 
in our echo chambers and 
making assumptions about 
those outside.

Bill Maher is scared of tolerance brought by safe spaces
TREVOR LAZAR
Established liberal come-
dian and political commen-
tator Bill Maher has made 
a career of pushing back at 
“political correctness” from 
his fellow progressives and 
peers. He, infamously, used 
a racial slur on air just last 
year and has been spouting 
clear Islamophobia under 
the guise of atheism for well 
over a decade. In our modern 
political climate, however, 
Maher has taken a new direc-
tion in pushing back against 
the left.
Maher frequently in-
vites guests — such as Milo 
Yiannopoulos and Jordan 
Peterson — that are either 
part of the alt-right or are 
sometimes affiliated with the 
alt-right. Another common 
factor linking Yiannopoulos 
and Peterson is the resistance 
they have faced when speak-
ing on college campuses. 
Maher takes particular is-
sue with mass protests that 
prevent public figures from 
speaking at pre-arranged 
events at various universi-
ties; his go-to example is 
UC Berkeley, which, by Ma-
her’s view, is consistent po-
litically and administratively 
with every college campus 
in America. But while Maher 
likes to elevate these folks to 
an even greater public plat-
form on his show than they 
would receive at any given 
university, he simultaneous-
ly plays into the hands of far-
right extremists and bigots 
operating under the purport-
ed protections of free speech.
Maher finds common 
ground with figures like 
Yiannopoulos and especially 
Peterson on the issue of free 
speech, or perhaps more ac-
curately, the ability of any 
given person to say whatev-
er they want, no matter the 
harm they may do unto oth-
ers. Maher’s favorite scape-
goat is, of course, college 
students, especially the ones 
who stage protests at speak-
ing events or take issue with 
jokes that are “politically in-
correct.” (As an aside, Ma-
her’s first show was called 
Politically Incorrect, which, 
incidentally, was canceled 
after Maher said something 
politically incorrect post-
9/11.) So, even as a promi-
nent liberal television per-
sonality, Maher’s opponents 
of choice appear to be his 
younger liberal peers.
What Maher misses in his 
criticism is key to under-
standing the disconnect be-
tween liberal intellectuals of 
his generation and younger, 
more progressive liberals. 
Maher hates the idea of “safe 
spaces,” first and foremost, 
but he does not actually 
understand their purpose or 
frequency. Safe spaces are 
intended to give students 
— especially those who are 
disadvantaged or marginal-
ized — the physical space 
and time to unwind with 
those of similar backgrounds 
and experiences. They are 
meant to help build strength 
and patience for those of us 
whose patience has been 
worn thin by discrimination 
and injustice present in their 
everyday lives.
Moreover, safe spaces are 
not the be all and end all. 
Safe spaces allow people to 
re-enter regular, unfiltered 
dialogue about these issues 
with skills specifically meant 
to further these tough con-
versations. Practicing discus-
sion or debriefing in a safe 
space actually furthers one’s 
capacity to handle and con-
front the ugly side of difficult 
social realities in their every-
day lives or in the context of 
unfiltered dialogue with op-
posing or even hostile coun-
terparts. They are not about 
avoiding tough issues, they 
are about learning how to 
deal with them in a smart, 
healthy way.
And yet, the reason Maher 
fails to understand safe 
spaces is far more complex. 
He is the product of a gen-
eration that, in many ways, 
is responsible for the social 
unrest that persists today. He 
may, in many cases, call out 
the problematic behaviors of 
those on the right or even be 
supportive of the marginal-
ized and disadvantaged, but 
he is uncomfortable with the 
idea of a shifting conversa-
tion. Maher is scared of a ma-
jor culture shift. The frame-
work of the conversation, as 
he understands it, extends 
to tolerance, but not accep-
tance, and as a result, he re-
mains inhibited in our mod-
ern dialogue. I, personally, 
am drawn to the “not that 
there’s anything wrong with 
it” joke from Seinfeld as re-
flective of Maher’s behavior. 
He may not take issue with 
the idea of gay people exist-
ing, for instance, but he does 
not want to view homosexu-
ality as normal or serve as 
an ally. His understanding of 
what it means to be progres-
sive is stagnant, and because 
he was on the cutting edge 
for so long, he refuses to con-
front the possibility that his 
beliefs may be dated.
So, instead, Maher turns 
to those on the far right for 
common ground, as the criti-
cisms facing Maher and the 
extremist guests of his show 
become more and more simi-
lar. He will continue to de-
fend his right, and the right 
of his traditional opponents 
– right-wing extremists and 
bigots – to say horrible, 
sexist, racist, transphobic 
things, and in the meantime, 
he will continue to elevate 
and indirectly legitimize 
the viewpoints of those 
whose beliefs he would have 
attacked vehemently even 
five years ago.
Maybe, truly, when he said 
the N-word on television last 
year, he held no sort of racial 
contempt in his heart. Even 
if that is the case, if even 
one bigot feels legitimized 
or justified in watching the 
show, is their much of a dif-
ference between Maher and 
the bigot? Some would say 
of course, but the impact 
will remain unchanged. This 
is why college students call 
for higher standards. This is 
why we protest when some-
one comes to our community 
spouting awful things. They 
may have the right to shout 
racial slurs and misogynis-
tic curses and homophobic 
garbage, but college stu-
dents have the right to fight 
back. We have the right to 
say, “that is not welcome in 
our community.” Because, 
if we allowed every intoler-
ant person a platform and a 
microphone to let out every 
horrible thing that came to 
mind, we would be fighting 
each other constantly, and 
we would be too focused 
shutting down nonsense to 
actually help the people who 
need it most.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could be a beacon of change for Democrats, but 
her reluctance to debate with the right-wing might ultimately be harmful.

Did you know who the 
Guardians of the Galaxy were 
in 2014?
Probably not. But hey, that 
sounded like an awesome 
name, right? And this movie 
that they’re featured in is 
made by the same company 
that made Iron Man and The 
Avengers, so it HAD to be 
good.
That was the mindset that 
I had when I went to see the 
James Gunn-directed ?ick 
from Marvel Studios, but 
walked out completely blown 
away by its wild originality, 
its beautiful and expansive 
world-building, its great 
humor, and by the fact that 
Guardians of the Galaxy felt 
so new and fresh within the 
Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Despite its obscure D-list 
characters, Guardians of the 
Galaxy grossed over $770 
million worldwide, defying 
expectations and becoming 
one of the most successful 
movies of the summer – in 
August, a rare feat for any 
summer blockbuster. In a 
skit called “Marvel Can’t 
Fail,” Saturday Night Live 
took aim at the fact that, 
since the monstrous success 
of The Avengers, Marvel 
Studios could make a ?lm 
about anything and still make 
millions of dollars.
It is that same kind of 
mob mentality that forced 
The Walt Disney Company 
to ?re James Gunn, director 
of Guardians of the Galaxy 
and its sequel Guardians of 
the Galaxy Vol. 2, from the 
production of Guardians of 
the Galaxy Vol. 3 last month, 
after far-right personality 
Michael Cernovich unearthed 
James Gunn’s old tweets 
from ten years ago, in which 
Gunn makes gay slurs and 
jokes about pedophilia, rape, 
and child molestation among 
other disgusting topics.
It is impossible to deny 
the fact that Cernovich had 
intentions to target Gunn, an 
outspoken critic of Donald 
Trump. But what is more 
disturbing is that Cernovich 
used movements like 
#TimesUp and #MeToo to do 
so.
Ever since Ronan Farrow 
wrote about Harvey 
Weinstein’s sexual assault 
allegations last October, we 
have seen powerful ?gures 
from various career worlds – 
journalists, actors, athletes, 
Hollywood executives, 
politicians – who have abused 
their positions of power, being 
taken down by the public. 
During the immediate wake 
of these allegations, there 
was a small period where the 
world felt united. People who 
had decided to come forward 
with their allegations were 
met with an outpouring of 
support from the Internet. 
Women had begun to truly 
realize that they were not the 
only ones experiencing this 
level of harassment within 
their daily lives. Around the 
world, people strove to come 
up with solutions for what the 
world could do better.
As more and more cases 
and allegations were brought 
to the limelight, however, 
some claims were proven to 
be false or over-exaggerated. 
Not everyone who got 
accused received the same 
kind of attention and action 
as other cases. The more 
these movements were thrust 
into the public eye, the more 
they became, according to 
Liam Neeson, “a bit of a witch 
hunt.” By January 2018, 
#MeToo and #TimesUp 
became a necessary inclusion 
into Hollywood’s awards 
shows and overall culture.
Cernovich, a man who was 
charged with rape in 2005 
and had falsely publicized a 
conspiracy about Democrats 
starting a child-sex ring in 
2016, exploited this popularity 
in the movement to target his 
political enemies. Cernovich 
saw the public instinct to grab 
pitchforks at the hint of an 
abuse of power, and abused it 
to solely bene?t himself. As a 
result, after Cernovich lit the 
match and unearthed Gunn’s 
tweets, the looming power of 
the public had done the rest 
– leading Disney to break all 
business ties with Gunn.
Possibly the worst thing to 
come out of this situation is 
that Cernovich took one man’s 
era of redemption to falsely 
(and hypocritically) remind 
the world that humans aren’t 
allowed to make mistakes. 
James Gunn has been candid 
about and has apologized 
for vulgar remarks he has 
made in the past, learning 
from his attitude since then 
to become a better person. 
Coming from a studio that 
often tells and bene?ts from 
stories of redemption, tales 
of rags-to-riches success, and 
adventures about conquering 
your own inner demons, 
Disney’s decision to ?re Gunn 
was incredibly ironic.
Ten days after James Gunn 
was ?red, the Guardians of 
the Galaxy cast made a joint 
statement together voicing 
support of Gunn, with one 
of the stars Dave Bautista 
even going as far to say he 
would quit the franchise 
if the studio did not use 
Gunn’s original script. In 
their memo, the cast hoped 
that people “can ease up on 
the character assassinations 
and stop weaponizing mob 
mentality,” talking about how 
Gunn is truly a good man and 
sharing feelings on how they 
were “discouraged by those so 
easily duped into believing the 
many outlandish conspiracy 
theories surrounding them.” 
While they are able to break 
away from the mob mentality 
surrounding the situation 
through their own personal 
knowledge of Gunn, this is 
not always the case whenever 
we read the news about one 
controversy after the other.
As we are taught to be 
independent while we 
transition to college, we 
are also taught that it’s 
completely okay to stand out 
in the crowd. We are taught 
that it’s completely okay to be 
different, to stand up for what 
we believe in, and are taught 
that our own beliefs matter 
to us. During Orientation, we 
are taught that our differences 
are fundamental to who we 
are, and all contribute to a 
part of the campus culture 
and experience in a greater 
way that can only bene?t 
ourselves and others.
So the next time when 
everyone else in the world 
seems to tell you to move on 
when you want to speak up, to 
quote Peggy Carter, “it is your 
duty to plant yourself like a 
tree, look them in the eye, and 
say ‘No, you move’.”
Gunn’s ?ring re?ects trend of demonizing over mistakes

EMMA FLICKINGER
SciTech Editor
Two Carnegie Mellon 
professors from the School 
of Computer Science have 
been hired by Facebook 
to head the company’s 
new Pittsburgh artificial 
intelligence lab.
Is this the start of 
a promising research 
collaboration? Or just an-
other case of the academic 
poaching plaguing top 
universities around the 
country?
The planned Facebook 
AI Research (FAIR) lab will 
be led by Jessica Hodgins, 
currently a professor of 
robotics and computer sci-
ence. Hodgins, a leader in 
her field whose research 
focuses on human motion 
in computer graphics and 
robotics, is the current 
president of the Associa-
tion for Computing Ma-
chinery’s Special Interest 
Group on Computer 
Graphics and Interactive 
Techniques (SIGGRAPH). 
Joining the lab will be as-
sociate professor Abhinav 
Gupta, who specializes 
in large-scale visual and 
robot learning.
The move was 
announced in July by Yann 
LeCun, the company’s 
director of AI research.
Carnegie Mellon, a 
leader in AI research, is a 
natural place for Facebook 
to look for talent. The uni-
versity is ranked #1 in the 
country in AI research, 
and in the fall, it will be 
the nation’s first to offer 
an undergraduate degree 
in AI. (Facebook will also 
be upgrading its FAIR lab 
in Seattle, to be headed by 
a professor from the Uni-
versity of Washington.) 
Facebook’s choice to 
expand its presence in 
Pittsburgh is a logical one.
The ethics of the move, 
however, are less straight-
forward. By siphoning 
talent from top research 
universities, Facebook is 
‘poaching,’ an increas-
ingly unpopular move. 
Many believe the shift of 
research jobs from uni-
versities to corporations 
has highly privatized re-
search, locking valuable 
scientific work behind 
non-disclosure agree-
ments. When researchers 
leave academia for lucra-
tive industry jobs, univer-
sities lose out on not only 
talent and intellectual 
property, but also grants, 
and the mentorship of 
young researchers.
When a job offer is 
made, it can be impossible 
for universities to retain 
their faculty; even the 
most idealistic have fami-
lies to feed. Academic jobs 
are scarce, and academic 
jobs that pay are scarcer.
Poaching is by no 
means a new issue on 
campus. Carnegie Mellon 
made national headlines 
in 2015 when the univer-
sity’s National Robotics 
Engineering Center 
(NREC) lost almost fifty 
people – a third of its 
staff – to Uber’s new Ad-
vanced Technologies Cen-
ter (ATC). “They took all 
the guys that were work-
ing on vehicle autonomy 
– basically whole groups, 
whole teams of develop-
ers, commercialization 
specialists, all the guys 
that find grants and who 
were bringing the intel-
lectual property,” a source 
reported, as quoted in a 
contemporaneous article 
by The Verge. “These guys, 
they took everybody.” 
Uber, then valued at be-
tween $60 billion and 
$70 billion, built the ATC 
to develop autonomous 
vehicles. The sheer scale 
of the controversial move 
brought national aware-
ness to the issue of aca-
demic poaching.
Facebook, sensitive to 
how these issues might 
affect its image, maintains 
that they are not aiming 
to repeat the Uber exo-
dus. “Facebook is careful 
not to deplete universities 
from their best faculty, by 
making it easy to main-
tain sizeable research 
and teaching activities in 
their academic labs,” Le-
Cun, also a professor of 
computer science at New 
York University, wrote 
in the announcement. 
“Unlike others, we work 
with universities to find 
suitable arrangements 
and do not hire away 
large numbers of faculty 
into full-time positions 
bottled up behind a wall 
of non-disclosure agree-
ments. We contribute to 
the local ecosystem.” He 
emphasized that “mak-
ing these part-time splits 
possible is precisely the 
reason why we have been 
establishing labs in New 
York, Paris, Montréal, 
Tel Aviv, and now Seattle 
and Pittsburgh.” After a 
New York Times article 
suggested Facebook was 
guilty of poaching, Lecun 
responded that it “errone-
ously qualified this evolu-
tion as a ‘brain drain’ from 
academia.”
The consensus in the 
academic community? 
That’s exactly what’s 
happening. “It is worri-
some that they are eating 
the seed corn,” said Dan 
Weld, a computer science 
professor at the University 
of Washington, in the New 
York Times story. “If we 
lose all our faculty, it will 
be hard to keep preparing 
the next generation of re-
searchers.” University re-
searchers hired part-time 
by Facebook often spend 
four-fifths of their time 
working at the company.
Despite its alleged goal, 
poaching often strains the 
relationships between 
academia and industry. 
Uber’s cherry-picking in 
2015 stirred resentment in 
the university researchers 
left behind at the NREC.
Carnegie Mellon, in 
official statements, has 
maintained an optimis-
tic outlook for the FAIR 
partnership. “We wel-
come Facebook’s FAIR 
lab to Pittsburgh, which 
will provide our faculty 
and students with new 
opportunities to engage 
in groundbreaking re-
search. From experience 
with our many partners 
in the city, we know that 
corporate activity close to 
campus is of mutual ben-
efit to the university and 
our partners,” said Mark 
Nolan, Carnegie Mellon’s 
associate vice president of 
institutional partnerships, 
as quoted in a July press 
release.
The press release also 
quoted Andrew Moore, 
Dean of the School of 
Computer Science, saying 
“Facebook’s new lab will 
create new opportunities 
to make advances in AI, 
both at the company and 
at CMU. Even better, both 
Jessica and Abhinav will 
continue their work at 
CMU, helping us educate 
the next generation of AI 
scientists.”
As a high-profile re-
searcher, Moore has been 
discussing poaching pub-
licly for several years – 
expressing frustration at 
the difficulty of retaining 
faculty, while remaining 
diplomatic and stress-
ing the complexity of the 
issue. “It’s kind of crazy 
that these top folks on the 
faculty, most of their peers 
who go into industry are 
wealthy and don’t need 
to worry about money 
anymore, whereas [pro-
fessors are often left] wor-
rying about sending their 
kids to college. It’s very 
tempting to go, which is 
why I and the department 
heads here have actually 
begun encouraging them 
to do a startup for a few 
years, or else work for 
big companies, and come 
back,” he explained in a 
2016 interview with Tech-
Crunch. Moore himself re-
joined Carnegie Mellon’s 
faculty in 2014 after 8 
years at Google.
Overall, Moore 
encourages acceptance 
of the movement of 
researchers from aca-
demia to industry, and 
back, as the new reality 
of research. “At a place 
like CMU’s School of Com-
puter Science, I expect to 
see more and more ebb 
and flow of the planet’s 
top roboticists, theorists 
and algorithmists. I don’t 
see the ‘ebb’ part of this as 
defeat. It just means we’re 
living in a free market for 
brilliant people,” he said 
in 2016.
According to the 
university press release, 
the FAIR lab “will focus on 
robotics, lifelong learning 
systems that learn con-
tinuously, teaching ma-
chines to reason, and AI 
in support of creativity.” 
It’s currently unclear what 
Facebook plans to do in 
the field of robotics.

Islands can do funny 
things to an animal 
population.
Foster’s rule states 
that populations will get 
smaller or larger when 
isolated on an island de-
pending on the available 
resources. When resources 
are limited, the species 
competing for those re-
sources get smaller over 
time. This process, known 
as insular dwar?sm, oc-
curs when a population’s 
range is limited to a small 
area. Smaller animals 
require fewer resources, 
and a reduced size means 
shorter gestation periods 
and generation times.
We often forget it, but 
humans are not immune 
to the forces of evolution.
A recent report pub-
lished in Science found 
evidence for two separate 
instances of insular dwarf-
ism arising in hominins 
on the Indonesian island 
Flores. The ?rst is the 
ancient extinct species 
Homo ?oresiensis. This 
diminutive species lived 
on the island for a period 
beginning about 700,000 
years ago to 60,000 years 
ago, and had an estimated 
average height of only 106 
cm (about 3’ 6”), earn-
ing them the nickname 
“hobbit.”
Not far from the Liang 
Bua cave where the hobbit 
fossils were found (along 
with several giant and 
dwarfed animal species – 
giant rats anyone?), there 
is a modern population of 
pygmy humans living on 
Flores. The researchers 
wanted to know: are the 
two populations related?
The question, though 
simple, is dif?cult to an-
swer. We don’t have DNA 
from the Homo ?oresien-
sis fossils, so they couldn’t 
just identify ancient genes 
and then search the mod-
ern pygmies’ genomes for 
familiar fragments. To an-
swer the question, the re-
searchers from Princeton 
University had to go in the 
opposite direction.
The researchers looked 
at the DNA of 32 modern 
pygmies, who live on 
Flores in a village called 
Rampasasa, and have an 
average height of about 
147 cm (4’10”). These 
modern pygmies have in-
herited genes from Nean-
derthals and Denisovans 
(another extinct hom-
inin species). Scientists 
know enough about the 
genomes of these two ex-
tinct species to identify 
“chunks” of them in the 
modern humans’ DNA. 
Then, they can scan the 
genome for unfamiliar 
chunks that come from a 
different source, such as 
Homo ?oresiensis.
The researchers didn’t 
?nd any evidence of ge-
netic material from an 
unknown source. This 
led them to conclude that 
there was no gene ?ow 
from the hobbits to the 
modern population. The 
modern Flores pygmies 
are most closely related 
to other East Asians, but 
about 23 percent of their 
ancestry comes from New 
Guinea. The lack of evi-
dence for admixture of 
Homo ?oresiensis in the 
modern pygmies’ DNA 
suggests the action of a 
process called polygenic 
selection. As a polygenic 
trait, height is affected 
by variations of alleles at 
many different ?xed posi-
tions on chromosomes (as 
opposed to one gene that 
can be ‘on’ or ‘off’).
The researchers found 
that the genomes of the 
population from Flores 
were enriched for height-
decreasing alleles — more 
of these height-related loci 
contained variants that are 
associated with shortness. 
These genes were present 
in a common ancestor of 
both the modern Flores 
pygmies and Europeans. 
This means that natural 
selection worked with the 
genetic material present 
in the early population; 
genes from Homo ?ore-
siensis are not necessary 
to account for the reduc-
tion in height.
This method of 
investigation was 
potentially the only way 
to learn about the hobbit’s 
genome from extant popu-
lations. While the results 
are disappointing, they 
do lead to an interesting 
conclusion: insular dwarf-
ism arose in two indepen-
dent hominin populations 
on the same island. It’s 
not just animals that is-
lands impact; they change 
humans too.
CMU professor studies galaxy collision
Insular dwar?sm allows islanders to conserve resources
VALENE MEZMIN
Editor-in-Chief
When you think about 
the Milky Way colliding 
with another galaxy, 
the ?rst thing that prob-
ably comes to mind is 
its predicted collision 
with our neighbor gal-
axy Andromeda. Nick-
named Milkomeda or 
Milkdromeda, the colli-
sion is not expected to oc-
cur for another four bil-
lion years, possibly long 
after terrestrial life can 
be supported on Earth 
and hopefully long after 
someone can think of a 
better name for it.
However, it’s thought 
that the Milky Way 
has a long history of 
colliding with dwarf 
galaxies, reshaping its 
structure each time. For 
example, the Milky Way’s 
collision with the nearby 
Sagittarius galaxy may be 
to thank for our galaxy’s 
signature spiral arms.
A team of researchers, 
including Carnegie 
Mellon University Phys-
ics professor Sergey Ko-
posov, have discovered 
that approximately eight 
to ten billion years ago, 
the Milky Way experi-
enced a head on collision 
with one galaxy in partic-
ular, possibly its largest 
collision known to date.
This dwarf galaxy, 
nicknamed the “Sausage” 
galaxy, did not survive 
the impact. New papers 
in the Monthly Notices of 
the Royal Astronomical 
Society explain that the 
team of researchers used 
data from the European 
Space Agency’s Gaia 
satellite, which maps 
the stellar content of our 
galaxy. This data showed 
that the collision left 
that dwarf galaxy’s stars 
moving in radial orbits 
with a general oval shape 
which led to the galaxy’s 
nickname.
“We plotted the 
velocities of the stars, and 
the sausage shape just 
jumped out at us,” said 
Wyn Evans, a researcher 
in Cambridge. “As the 
smaller galaxy broke up, 
its stars were thrown 
onto very radial orbits. 
These Sausage stars are 
what’s left of the last ma-
jor merger of the Milky 
Way.”
After the collision 
between the two gal-
axies, the researchers 
believe that the path 
of the stars from the 
mutilated Sausage galaxy 
took them to the center of 
the Milky Way, creating 
the “bulge” of stars at our 
galaxy’s center and the 
surrounding stellar halo. 
“This is a telltale sign that 
the dwarf galaxy came in 
on a really eccentric or-
bit,” said Vasily Belokurov 
of the University of Cam-
bridge and the Center 
for Computational As-
trophysics at the Flatiron 
Institute in a statement 
for the Simons Founda-
tion. The researchers also 
believe that the Sausage 
galaxy is responsible for 
multiple globular clusters 
within the Milky Way.
The researchers plan 
to continue their study 
of the effects of this colli-
sion and the chemistry of 
the stars that came from 
the Sausage galaxy.
Can universities help tech industry rethink morals?
NAVIYA SINGLA
Staffwriter
In the wake of several 
high-pro?le ethical failures 
– Uber’s self-driving scan-
dals, Facebook’s privacy 
violations, Google’s grow-
ing monopoly and Eliza-
beth Holmes’s big letdown 
– Silicon Valley’s moral 
backbone, or lack there-
of, is more apparent now 
than ever. According to a 
New York Times article, the 
tech industry needs new 
words to live by: perhaps 
“?rst, do no harm” should 
replace the tech industry’s 
standard “build it ?rst, ask 
questions later” ethos.
One might argue that 
this no-holds barred 
developmental cycle is 
what leads to rapid inno-
vation, but innovation is 
no excuse for disregard-
ing the lives of people af-
fected by these companies’ 
ethical mistakes. With 
the immense amount of 
power these companies 
hold, turning a blind eye 
to what their products or 
services are being used for 
is complicity in the face of 
cruelty. Ignorance is not an 
excuse that can be used to 
justify privilege.
Cognizant of the 
industry’s lack of ethical 
standards, many schools 
are incorporating ethics 
and morality into the cur-
riculum for their technolo-
gy-based majors. Stanford 
is currently developing a 
course to focus on “ethics, 
society and technology”; 
University of Texas at 
Austin offers “Ethical 
Foundations of Computer 
Science”; Harvard and 
MIT have a new course in 
the same ?eld. Carnegie 
Mellon currently offers 
several classes in this ?eld, 
such as Computation Eth-
ics for NLP, Ethics and Pol-
icy Issues in Computing, 
Green Computing and Pol-
icy, Technology and Law.
In 2016, Carnegie 
Mellon received a $10 mil-
lion grant from law ?rm 
K&L Gates LLC to help 
“ensure CMU’s leadership 
in the emerging ?eld of 
ethical and policy issues 
surrounding arti?cial in-
telligence and other com-
puting technologies.” The 
fund was intended to sup-
port students and faculty 
members doing research 
in that ?eld, which puts 
the school in a very good 
position. As a university, 
Carnegie Mellon is do-
ing comparatively well in 
terms of considering the 
repercussions of the cut-
ting edge technology that 
it produces.
As a community, 
however, it still has a long 
way to go. The way we 
treat each other in STEM 
environments can’t be 
different from the way 
we would like to treat 
the world. Recently, two 
distinguished professors 
resigned from Carnegie 
Mellon citing claims of 
“professional harassment.” 
While this may seem unre-
lated to the grand scale of 
ethics and the culture of in-
novation in the tech indus-
try, it is an important ex-
ample of the culture within 
the industry.
These problems are 
not separate. The solution 
to improving the culture 
of the tech community is 
not to simply introduce 
courses in the hopes that 
students will just “be bet-
ter”, but to actively work 
to make things better, and 
repair the existing chinks 
in our armour.

Get to know Carnegie Mellon’s club sports teams!
MEL KERBER
Staffwriter
Students at Carnegie 
Mellon are known for their 
diverse set of interests, and 
nowhere is this clearer than 
in options for club sports. 
From the more tradition-
al soccer, basketball, and 
baseball, to anything from 
cricket to Quidditch, there 
are countless options to get 
involved while on campus.
So what are club sports? 
Unlike varsity sports, club 
sports are entirely student-
run. They establish their 
own leadership, schedules, 
and dues, all while keeping 
up a practice schedule and 
dedicating themselves to 
their team and their sport. 
Experience level by team can 
vary — some of the more 
traditional teams may have 
members who have played 
for years, while other op-
tions like ultimate frisbee 
or badminton offer a great 
chance to learn something 
new while picking up a new 
passion.
Badminton
Founded in 2001, the 
badminton club is a great en-
vironment for anyone look-
ing to learn or improve on 
their badminton skills. The 
club provides most of the 
necessary equipment, and 
for interested players, there 
are options to register and 
compete in tournaments.

Football
The Carnegie Mellon 
football team started the 
2017 season with a bang, 
winning its ?rst ?ve games. 
The team lost some steam 
towards the back end of 
the season, ?nishing with 
a 7–4 record. At the Presi-
dents’ Athletic Conference 
media day, the Tartans 
were voted to ?nish fourth 
in the preseason poll, with 
one ?rst-place votes. The 
team looks to put together 
another winning season 
this fall while ?lling the ab-
sences of the program’s all-
time leading rusher, Sam 
Benger, and proli?c receiv-
er John Prather, who both 
graduated this past spring.
The team turns to new 
leaders going into the 2018 
season. Senior quarterback 
Alex Cline will return af-
ter 17 career starts and a 
record-breaking junior sea-
son. Cline threw for 2,336 
yards, breaking the school’s 
single-season passing re-
cord, and 24 touchdowns. 
Also leading the team is 
senior cornerback Ethan 
Anderson, one of the team’s 
captains, who is returning 
after a stellar 2017 season. 
He ?nished the season with 
63 tackles, 47 solo, and 4.5 
for loss, and four fumble 
recoveries. The 2018 team 
kicks of the season on 
Sept. 8 at the University of 
Rochester.
Soccer
The Carnegie Mel-
lon women’s soccer team 
?nished its superb 2017 
season with a narrow loss 
to Hardin-Simmons Uni-
versity in the sectional 
semi?nal of the 2017 NCAA 
Division II Women’s Soccer 
Championship. After post-
ing a 15–3–2 record, sev-
eral of the Tartan players 
received season honors for 
their great play. Senior for-
ward Haili Adams started 
all 20 games, recorded 52 
shots (30 on goal), scored 
12 goals, including seven 
game winners, and added 
three assists. Adams’ play 
earned her numerous team 
selections, including the 
United Soccer Coaches All-
America First Team and 
the All-University Athletic 
Association (UAA) First 
Team. Fellow seniors Tori 
Iatarola and Alex Moy also 
received honors. First-year 
goalkeeper Carolyn Botz 
was named the Eastern 
College Athletic Confer-
ence (ECAC) Division III 
Women’s Soccer Defen-
sive Player of the year and 
Rookie of the Year. She was 
also named to the All-UAA 
First Team.
Botz and fellow 
returning Tartan players 
look to continue their suc-
cess on the pitch in the 2018 
season. The team begins its 
season hosting Shenando-
ah University on Aug. 31.
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team played 
several close games during 
the 2017 season, ?nish-
ing three double overtime 
games with draws, and ulti-
mately posting a 10–4–3 re-
cord. Strong returning Tar-
tan players look to lead the 
team in the 2018 season. 
Rising senior mid?elder 
Zack Masciopinto led the 
team with eight goals, two 
which were game winners, 
and had 48 shots (26 on 
goal) while starting 17 
games. Masciopinto was 
named to the All-UAA First 
Team. Rising senior de-
fender Jack McCambridge 
started 15 games, and 
was named to the College 
Sports Information Direc-
tors of America (CoSIDA) 
Academic All-America First 
Team. The Tartans’ ?rst 
match of the season will be 
at Denison University on 
Aug. 31.
Volleyball
The Carnegie Mellon 
volleyball team went 16–0 
to start the 2017 season 
and ?nished with a 30–5 
record and a NCAA Divi-
sion III Championship Sec-

It’s almost time to hit 
the books again, folks! 
The dog days of summer 
are just about finished, 
and you can almost feel 
Pittsburgh getting ready 
for a fall full of sweaters, 
coffee, and falling leaves. 
The most important thing 
about these next few 
months, however, marks a 
unique time in sports: the 
NFL, NHL, and MLB will all 
have either preseason, reg-
ular season, or postseason 
matchups in September 
and October, and the black 
and gold is a team to watch 
in all three leagues.
The Pirates are cur-
rently in season, around 
two-thirds of the way done 
with their marathon 162-
game season and are sit-
ting in a tough spot. The 
2018 Pirates have been 
defined by streaks: an 
11-game winning streak 
that thrust the Bucs back 
into contention for a wild 
card spot, or a very recent 
4-game losing skid that has 
lots of fans feeling regret 
that the front office went 
all-in at the non-waiver 
trade deadline, picking 
up RHP Keone Kela and 
RHP Chris Archer from the 
Texas Rangers and Tam-
pa Bay Rays. These two 
trades cost the Pirates in 
their prospect pool, with 
the Bucs having to give 
up RHP Tyler Glasnow, OF 
Austin Meadows, and RHP 
Shane Baz, all top 10 pros-
pects in the Pirates system 
at one time or another.
The bright side to all 
this is that the Bucs are 
holding onto Archer and 
Kela for a few years to 
come, and have a cheap, 
young, talented pitching 
roster under contract for 
the next couple of years, 
so even if they don’t make 
the postseason this year, 
which is very possible, 
they still have a chance in 
the coming years. Watch 
out for them to lose a wild 
card postseason matchup 
against the Brewers, if 
they make it at all.
The Steelers are looking 
hot right now. We’ve seen 
new additions from the 
draft in quarterback Ma-
son Rudolph and receiver 
James Washington, both 
from Oklahoma State Uni-
versity. Their chemistry on 
the field was evident in the 
first two preseason games.
While we haven’t seen 
Big Ben Roethlisberger 
throwing at all, there’s no 
reason not to believe re-
ports coming out of train-
ing camp that Big Ben is 
healthier and in better 
shape than he has been in 
quite a few years. Hope-
fully we’ll see another 
spectacular season from 
him and fellow veter-
ans Antonio Brown and 
Le’veon Bell. The Killer 
B’s have been unstoppable 
in the past two years, and 
they aren’t looking to slow 
down any time soon.
The offensive trio that 
Pittsburgh possesses is 
dangerous and will be 
complemented with help 
from second-year receiver 
Juju Smith-Schuster, who 
had a breakout rookie year 
and has continued his suc-
cess in the first two pre-
season matchups, with a 
touchdown reception in 
both games. Additionally, 
the Steelers look to have a 
solid one-two punch in the 
backfield as James Connor 
returns from a knee in-
jury that ended his rookie 
season early. He has been 
doing much of the same 
hard-nosed, powerful ball-
carrying as he did during 
his tenure with the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. Look for 
these guys to open their 
season strong, and carry 
this momentum over week 
to week.
The Penguins are in a 
tough spot. Their window 
of “greatness” is closing 
soon, with Sidney Crosby, 
Evgeni Malkin, and Phil 
Kessel all growing a little 
older, and they need to 
strike now while the iron 
is hot. The team is fresh 
off their first Stanley Cup 
playoff series loss in three 
years and are looking to re-
turn to the team they were 
when they won back-to-
back Stanley Cups.
Although Malkin and 
Kessel are getting older, 
their production isn’t slow-
ing down. Kessel is coming 
off a career year, scoring 
92 points, breaking his 
previous high by 10. Mal-
kin had 98 points last sea-
son, and only missed four 
games due to injury in the 
regular season. Crosby 
played all 82 games for the 
first time in his career, and 
although he didn’t score as 
many points as we’re used 
to seeing from him, he was 
still a threat every moment 
he was on the ice.
Overall, the Pens’ core 
is good. A strong presence 
that can be spread out on 
three lines, but what’s 
missing? Depth, all over 
the board, is the answer. 
The Pens addressed that 
problem in a rather strange 
manner this offseason, 
signing defenseman Jack 
Johnson to a 5-year deal, 
Matt Cullen to a 1-year 
deal, and a few other 
depth wingers. No one 
seems to stand out in the 
trades from this year. Jack 
Johnson is being heralded 
as a disappointment wait-
ing to happen by every ma-
jor sports newswriter, but 
I’m eager to see what the 
Penguins can do for him. 
These depth players don’t 
add a ton, but they might 
be competent enough to 
eat up some minutes for 
the top 6 guys. Look for 
them in the playoffs, but 
don’t expect another Cup 
win. I’m not too hopeful.
Pittsburgh teams prepare for new season of sports

On surviving on your own 
Hey Natalie,
So I’m about to start my first semester at college, and I 
come from out of state. I was the only one from my school 
– from my town, even – to go to Carnegie Mellon, so I feel 
like I’m all alone here. Everyone in my hometown all went 
to the same school, so we all practically grew up together. 
Coming here, I feel like I left everything behind – including 
all my friends.
Carnegie Mellon is somewhat a big school and there are 
tons of people, but I feel like I’m waaaay too socially 
awkward to try to make friends. I know the whole purpose 
of orientation is to meet new people and make friends, but 
I’m still super worried that everyone else already knows 
someone and already has friends here. Also, having to live 
with a roommate who is practically a stranger really freaks 
me out, but I don’t want to be alone. Do you have any 
advice for me?
-Loner, Oddball, Shy Too
Dear LOST,
Coming to a new school can be scary, especially to one 
that’s in a completely different state. I get how you feel: 
whether high school was a good experience or not, you 
spent four years with the same people in the same place. 
You spent all that time getting to know people and built 
friendships - and now, it feels like you have to do it all over 
again.
But the beautiful thing about college is this: everyone’s in 
the exact same boat. I remember first coming to Carnegie 
Mellon – I’m from out of state too, my hometown being 
a good couple thousand miles away in California – and 
feeling pretty similarly to you. But everything got easier the 
moment I realized that there were plenty of other people 
around me who felt the exact same way – scared, anxious, 
and alone. Turns out, those feelings are a pretty unanimous 
freshman year experience. Who knew, eh?
In all seriousness, it can be pretty scary to put yourself out 
there. It’s easy to acknowledge that everyone else is just 
as anxious as you are, but harder to do something about 
it. It will probably take a few days for everything to settle 
and to feel normal, but you will most definitely make friends 
soon enough. You are an amazing person surrounded by 
amazing people who all want to make friends, so I really 
encourage you to be brave and say just one word: “Hi.” 
After all, a great many friendships have started with a 
simple greeting! You’ll find out soon enough that Carnegie 
Mellon is full of incredibly open and welcoming people, and 
it’ll start to feel like home.
If you’re looking for some specifics, there are some 
really simple ways to try to grow your friend circle! For 
instance, leave the door to your dorm room open (while 
you’re in your room, of course)! This presents itself as a 
literal open invitation for others to say hi, and encourages 
conversations. Explore the different clubs on campus and 
join one that suits your interests. Clubs are always super 
friendly and eager to get new members, and can lead 
to some really meaningful and lasting relationships. And 
honestly, your RAs and OCs are your friends. They’ll always 
be happy to point you to your class or sit down and eat 
lunch with you.
You’ve already done an amazing job getting here and have 
already taken some brave steps to begin with. And I know 
it can be hard to see, but leaving your hometown is not an 
end. It’s just a new beginning.
Good luck to ya out there,
Natalie
P.s. about your roommate – don’t wake them up at ungodly 
hours of the morning, and you’ll be fine. I promise.
Natalie Schmidt | StaffwriterAdvice for Awkward People
Dear Natalie,
I’m going to be blunt: I’m worried college will be too 
hard for me. High school wasn’t that bad, I was a 
straight-A AP student, but hearing other students talk it 
seems like my grades are going to take a serious drop 
and it seriously worries me.
I mean, I already know Carnegie Mellon isn’t exactly 
a school where I can breeze on by. I’ve always tried 
to get A’s and get the best possible scores, but I get 
really discouraged when I hear other students say, 
“Well, I just need to pass to get my degree!” I’m just 
worried that I’m going to really struggle here. Do you 
have any advice about the college workload?
-From An Idiot Loser
Dear FAIL,
Since you did me the honor of being blunt, I will do 
you the same: I won’t lie. College can get pretty tough. 
There may be moments where you question your 
major or the legitimacy of your place here at Carnegie 
Mellon. But you know what? You’ve already got what it 
takes to succeed here. How do I know that, you might 
ask? Well, you’re already here, aren’t you?
We place a lot of our personal worth on our 
academic performance, especially at higher colleges 
like Carnegie Mellon. It can be difficult to separate 
yourself from the percentage you get on an exam, 
trust me, I know. A lot of straight-A and AP students 
have trouble dealing with the fact that their GPA will 
never be a 4.7 again, and that’s totally okay. The most 
important thing to remember is that it is MORE THAN 
okay to ask for help. 
My freshman year, I seriously struggled in Calculus 
despite having an A in my math class senior year. It 
might sound silly, but for a long time I refused to ask 
for help; back in high school, asking for help meant 
you couldn’t do it yourself, which meant you weren’t as 
smart as the kids who could (brutal, isn’t it?). I had to 
come to a tough realization that I was going to fail if 
I didn’t, so I took the hard-to-swallow pill and went to 
tutoring. I had almost failed a class just because I was 
too prideful to ask for help. But once I did, everything 
got so much easier. 
Everyone struggles. There will always be a hard 
class. But there are some really great resources on 
campus to help you when you need it. Your biggest 
one is your fellow students! We all know the struggle, 
and in my experience, everyone has been more than 
willing to help you out if you need it. There’s always 
tutoring – taught by TAs and upperclassmen – and you 
can get professional coaching through our Academic 
Development center. Go to office hours, reach out to 
your professor – we’re all here to help you succeed, 
and there is no shame in asking others for help. 
TL;DR: Don’t be freshman year me. Ask for help when 
you need it. Someone will gladly be there for you to 
help with a tricky formula or to bring you those sweet 
sweet calculus notes.
Now get out there and get those grades!
-Natalie
On passing your classes

---------------------------------------------------

When I first arrived to Pittsburgh, one thing I quickly learned is that the city has an underrated food scene. There’s something for 
everyone, and there are endless choices within walking or busing distance of Carnegie Mellon’s campus. There are three main 
neighborhoods that surround campus: Oakland to the west, Shadyside to the north, and Squirrel Hill to the southeast. All three 
neighborhoods have amazing food choices to offer, and here are some you have to check out!
Oakland
Pamela’s Diner
A Pittsburgh breakfast staple since 1980, Pamela’s Diner is famous for 
its crepe-style pancakes, called hotcakes. They’re thin and crispy at 
the edges, and are delicious with cream and maple syrup, or stuffed 
with fruit like strawberry and blueberry. I also recommend the corned 
beef hash with two eggs on the side. Down Forbes Avenue, Pamela’s 
is a great spot to get your day started on the weekends. The wait can 
get pretty long, so plan accordingly.
Las Palmas
Down Atwood Street off Forbes Avenue, Las Palmas is easy to miss, 
but the tacos are decidedly can’t-miss — they’re that good. Las Palmas 
is a food cart attached to a small Mexican grocery store. For $2.50 
a taco, you can get authentic Mexican tacos with any meat and 
unlimited toppings, from salsa to guacamole to chimichurri.
The Porch
If you’re looking for a more formal spot, try The Porch. Next to 
Schenley Plaza and the Carnegie Museums, this place is perfect for 
a nice brunch, late-night cravings, or a place to take the family. They 
offer a wide variety of daily soups and salads, thin-crust pizzas, and 
large sandwiches. And from Monday through Thursday, go between 
9-11 p.m. for half-off pizzas!
Shadyside
Noodlehead
Along South Highland Avenue, the 71B will take you straight to this student hotspot. I would describe Noodlehead as thai food for 
millennials. The place is rustic, with dark mood lighting and many decorative plants. The menu is limited, and it’s cash only, but the 
entrees are so good it doesn’t matter. They offer pad thai, curries, and pork buns, but my favorite is their see yew, with flavorful 
wide noodles and the choice of chicken, shrimp, or tofu.
Millie’s Homemade Ice Cream
Next door to Noodlehead is Millie’s Homemade Ice Cream, my favorite ice cream spot in Pittsburgh. Millie’s rotates flavors 
by month, but has great staples in Chad’s Vanilla and Vietnamese Coffee. I’ve loved their temporary flavors like Lavender and 
Mango, and I’m always excited to see what new things they come up with. But the one thing you must get is the waffle cone. It’s 
warm and delicious with a touch of cinnamon, and really makes the ice cream sing.

Where To Eat In Pittsburghwritten by Marika Yang | Sports Editor

---------------------------------------------------

The Yard
Off the bustling Walnut Street, The Yard is quintessential Pittsburgh. Wood floors, a long bar, and ample television sets for sports-
watchers. The Yard is all about grilled cheese. They put everything on it—mac ‘n’ cheese, onion rings, pulled pork, pierogis—liter-
ally any grilled cheese concoction you can think of. Also be sure to try the sweet potato fries with the cinnamon butter dip. Your 
stomach will be so full, but so very happy.
Squirrel Hill
Sichuan Gourmet
Squirrel Hill boasts many wonderful Asian restaurants, and Sichuan Gourmet might just be the best of the bunch. Any of the 61 bus 
lines will take you to the intersection of Forbes and Murray Avenue, and this place is right down Murray. The menu has some truly 
authentic Chinese choices, like stir-fry green beans, braised beef tendon, and sliced pork belly. They also have an American menu, 
with staples like lo mein and General Tso’s chicken, but I suggest trying the Chinese menu; many of my Chinese friends say it’s the 
best in the city.
Everyday Noodles
If you’re in the mood for noodles, Everyday Noodles is the place for you, right down Forbes past Murray. Inside the restaurant, 
there is a glass window so patrons can see the chefs make the hand-made noodles from scratch, threading the dough through their 
fingers. The beef noodle soup is some of the best I’ve had in the States, and the soup dumplings are top-notch as well.
Waffallonia
It’s right there in the title: waffles! Waffles and a scoop of ice cream, waffles slathered in Nutella, waffles with banana and straw-
berry — this place has a wide variety of combinations of sweet desserts. Each one is pretty large, so you can split one with a friend 
after a nice meal down the street. The only downside is that there’s limited seating, but the waffles go quickly, so it’s usually not a 
problem.
There are many more food places in Pittsburgh that I love, but these are the best spots to get started. Bon Appetit!5

Top Spots In Pittsburgh
A guide to having fun in the Steel City.
Whether you’re a freshman or an upperclassman, it’s easy to get comfortable with the nearby common spots to visit in Pittsburgh. 
Without realizing it, you find yourself gravitating to the places everyone else frequents and talking yourself out of venturing too 
far from campus. Sometimes it’s hard to even know where to start in terms of exploring the city. This is where I come in. Whether 
you want to recruit a group of adventure buddies or would rather opt for a solo outing, I’ve compiled a list of places worth 
visiting on your journey to becoming a Pittsburgher.
When You Want Something to Eat
Millvale Food Truck Park: The Millvale Food Truck Park is the place to go no matter what you’re in the mood to eat. The rota-
tion of food trucks is constantly changing, serving everything from Argentinian steak sandwiches, to gyros, to a classic burger 
and fries. Stop by for dinner on the weekends and enjoy your meal as you watch the sun set, listen to live music, and play a few 
games of cornhole. Interested in a post-meal treat? Grab some ice-cream or a smoothie from one of the dessert trucks and stroll 
down to the river to take in a beautiful view.
When You Want an Outdoor Adventure
Frick Environmental Center: While Frick Park is known for its extensive hiking and biking trails, the park also boasts a new 
Environmental Center and community garden. The building itself is both functional and beautiful and hosts a variety of different 
sustainability themed events throughout the year. You can take a stroll through the wildflower meadow behind the center and 
watch the birds and other wildlife that frequent the space. Don’t forget to check out the garden while you’re there, and take a 
walk through the rows of fresh fruit and veggies. And the best part of the center is you can always add a loop through the forest 
into your visit.
When You Want Some Culture
Carnegie Music Hall: If you’re the kind of person that looks beyond the classroom for opportunities to learn, then it’s about time 
you looked into events at the Carnegie Music Hall. The Hall hosts an endless cycle of entertaining and educational lectures and 
performances by visiting authors, artists, and musicians throughout the entire year. And the guests aren’t B-list names you’ve 
never heard of. Last year the Music Hall welcomed legends like Isabel Allende, Sherman Alexie, and world renowned events like 
The Moth Mainstage. The best part of the Carnegie Music Hall is it’s just a five-minute walk from campus, so you don’t have any 
excuse not to enjoy Pittsburgh’s cultural offerings. 
When You Want to Window Shop
Butler Street, Lawrenceville: If you’re new to Pittsburgh, Lawrenceville is one of those neighborhoods you might not immediately 
think to explore since it takes a bit more effort than hopping on a 61 to get there. But, I can assure you, the added effort is well 
worth it. Butler Street in particular has something for everyone. It’s a great place to find something unique for your dorm room, 
buy a birthday gift for friends or family, and just enjoy some general retail therapy. Candle Lab, Wildcard, and Una Biologicals 
are just a few of the stores you won’t want to miss.
When You Want to Relax
Phipps Conservatory: Phipps is one of those Pittsburgh attractions that most Carnegie Mellon students visit within their first few 
weeks of school; it’s beautiful, free to students, and a convenient five-minute walk from campus. But as the year stretches on, stu-
dents often forget to take advantage of the conservatory as a great place to take a break and relax off campus. On the week-
ends or just when you find yourself with the odd hour of downtime between classes, take some time to enjoy the sights and smells 
as you walk through the gardens or find a quiet corner to sit and listen to music.

---------------------------------------------------

When You Want to Watch a Movie
Manor Theater: The Manor Theater is the 
perfect place to see a movie when you 
want the effect of the big screen with-
out giving up the coziness of your own 
bed. The Manor always feels comfy and 
intimate due to the old-fashioned conces-
sion stand, the small theater sizes, and 
the number of Squirrel Hill grandmoth-
ers and families that tend to frequent the 
theater. Ever find yourself in the mood to 
go to the movies by yourself? The Manor 
is the place to go. It’s a quick bus ride 
from campus and always offers a balance 
of blockbuster movies and lesser-known 
independent films.
Row House Cinema: From foreign films 
to indie flicks to Harry Potter marathons, 
Row House Cinema (a single screen 
theater in Lawrenceville) is always play-
ing something unexpected. Each week the 
theater features a set of films all related 
to a certain theme such as magical real-
ist works, 2000s cinema, or French new 
wave films. This theater is the perfect spot 
to catch a movie when you’re not in the 
mood to go see that blockbuster everyone 
else has seen and you want to be exposed 
to something different.
When You Want to be Active
ASCEND: College is the time to try new 
things, right? So why not go all out and 
try picking up a new physical activity like 
rock climbing? ASCEND Pittsburgh, an 
indoor rock climbing gym that boasts a 
10,000 square foot “Walltopia,” is the 
best spot in the Burgh to learn. The gym 
offers yoga and other fitness classes in 
addition to their climbing courses all days 
of the week. Not only does ASCEND pro-
vide the resources for you to become an 
expert climber, but also a connection to 
the incredible community of climbers in the 
Pittsburgh area.
Arsenal Bowling: Bowling is one of those 
sports that doesn’t get enough credit. It’s 
the best way to do a physical activity 
without having to be too active which 
makes it the perfect sport for a busy 
Carnegie Mellon student. Head to 
Lawrenceville’s Arsenal Bowling with 
your friends to enjoy a few games after 
a long week and take advantage of 
the different daily specials and deals 
Arsenal offers. From Wednesday’s 
“Rock ‘N’ Bowl” to Friday’s “Fri-Yay DJ 
Party” your time at Arsenal is sure to 
feel more like a party than your average 
bowling experience.
When You Want Dessert
Millie’s Homemade Ice Cream: You’ll 
find out about Millie’s one way or 
another, so you might as well get 
hooked on the unique and delicious 
flavors of Millie’s ice cream as early 
as possible. The second you walk into 
Millie’s, you’re enveloped in the smell 
of warm sugar and overwhelmed by the 
number of options up on the board. But 
don’t worry, you’re sure to end up with 
the perfect cone no matter which flavors 
you pick. Not willing to wait in the long 
line? Head straight to the checkout and 
grab a pint (or five) to take home!
Naturoll Creamery: Naturoll Creamery 
specializes in hand rolled ice cream 
that’s poured out, mixed with toppings, 
and rolled up right in front of you. Half 
the fun of the Naturoll experience is 
watching your server expertly mince 
your toppings and create a cup of rolled 
perfection. They offer delicious stan-
dards, like the cupcake roll that features 
nilla wafers, icing, and rainbow sprin-
kles, and monthly specials, like a berry-
filled concoction for the 4th of July. But 
you’re never limited to the menu options 
on the board; you can also choose from 
the seemingly endless list of toppings 
(nutella, oreos, pretzels, graham crack-
ers, and brownie pieces, to name a few) 
and create a Naturoll that’s all your 
own.

---------------------------------------------------

The first time I was exposed to classic rock music was 
when I was in third grade. My dad would play his 
favorite Journey, KISS and Queen albums whenever 
he drove me to school. I learned all the lyrics of 
each band’s greatest hits and even discovered a few 
of my own favorites, which I would usually play on 
repeat during those car rides. 70s/80s rock music 
became the first music genre that I had ever felt a 
deep emotional connection to, and it helped me get 
through my middle school and high school years. 
Once I got to college, I stopped listening for a while 
and it wasn’t until I attended the recent STYX concert 
in Burgettstown, PA that I began listening to classic 
rock on an almost daily basis again, ultimately 
remembering why I love the music so much.
The connection that I’ve made with classic rock is not 
just tied to my emotions, but also to my parents and 
their generation. Listening to older music gives me a 
small glimpse into their youth and the trends that my 
parents were (or might have been) into. When I first 
told them over the phone that I would be interview-
ing Lawrence Gowan of STYX and seeing the band 
in concert, both my parents screamed with excite-
ment. To be honest, I knew very little about STYX at 
the time so I couldn’t really relate to that excitement. 
My parents had to explain to me all they knew about 
the band and gave me suggestions for some songs I 
should listen to. After listening to more of their hits, 
I became an instant fan of STYX and understood a 
little better my parents’ fangirling for the band.
Being able to attend STYX’s concert in Burgettstown 
was something I had been looking forward to for a 
while, mainly because I knew I would get to experi-
ence a part of the past. I expected the audience 
to consist mostly of adults around my parents’ age, 
reliving that time when they were around my age. As 
someone who is nearing her twenties, I was curious 
to see what this whole scene would look like while 
also contemplating if I would be doing the same 
thing twenty years from now.
Because of traffic, I arrived a little late to the con-
cert. However, the first thing I heard was Tesla’s 
rocking performance of their song, “Modern Day 
Cowboy” blasting through the speakers, and my 
friend and I weren’t even inside the venue yet. I 
had never listened to Tesla before, but just hearing 
them play, especially their amazing guitar solo in 
the song, made me feel so excited for the rest of the 
concert.
Once I finally got in to the venue, Joan Jett & The 
Blackhearts were getting ready to perform. A large 
screen with the band’s logo hung right in the center 
of the stage with the full drum set, all the guitars, 
and microphones set and ready to go for the next 
act. The moment Joan Jett walked out on stage, I 
was immediately starstruck. She wore what looked to 
be a leather sleeveless top and skinny leather pants, 
with sneakers to complete the outfit. Her presence, 
performance, and well really everything about her 
represented authentic classic rock. She performed 
some of her most famous hits like “I Love Rock ‘n’ 
Roll,” “I Hate Myself for Loving You,” and “Bad 
Reputation.” For each song she performed, there 
was a different background on the large screen 
behind her; there were some images taken from 
scenes of her movie Light of Day with Michael J. Fox 
during her performance of the song “Light of Day,” 
as well as images of splattered paint during her per-
formance of “Love Is Pain.” Joan Jett ended her act 
with an encore and performed the song “Everyday 
People,” spreading only good vibes throughout the 
entire atmosphere of the venue.
Around twenty minutes after Joan Jett & The 
Blackhearts’ act, STYX came out ready to “get this 
show on the road,” performing “Gone Gone Gone” 
from their most recent album, The Mission. I definitely 
did not expect STYX’s entire performance to be one 
huge rock ‘n’ roll party. Especially once they started 
playing “Rockin’ The Paradise” from their Paradise 
Theatre album, I saw all the members of the band 
starting to dance, goof off, and have the best time 
of their lives up on stage. STYX’s free spirited nature 
was contagious, and almost instantly they had the 
entire audience dancing as well.
The musical journey that STYX took the audience 
through during their concert was an experience like 
no other. The moods and atmosphere from the audi-
ence changed so naturally to match the tone of each 
song. The nostalgic feeling that most of the audience 
members had was very present, especially when 
the band brought out Chuck Panozzo, one of the 
founding members of STYX, to play “Fooling Yourself 
(The Angry Young Man).” One of the most amazing 
moments for me was seeing the audience at one point 
hold up a mix of lighters and using the light from their 
phones. That image vividly showed that even with 
the change in times, the impact of music on people is 
timeless. Throughout the whole concert, I saw people 
my parents’ age dance like no one was watching and 
even adults my grandparents’ age were swaying to 
the beat of the music. I don’t know if it was during the 
“Bohemian Rhaphsody” piano solo by STYX’s lead 
singer, Lawrence Gowan or when the band ended 
the night with “Mr. Roboto” and “Renegade” that 
I remembered how it felt listening to my dad’s rock 
music in the car. It was a unique and awesome feel-
ing, like even though I didn’t grow up during one of 
the peaks of the classic rock movement, I was proud 
that I was still somehow able to be a part of it.

---------------------------------------------------

My conversation with Lawrence Gowan, lead singer of 
iconic rock band STYX, began in the most interesting 
way: with a compliment from him on the title of our 
newspaper, The Tartan which led to a brief conversa-
tion about the pattern, tartan, and its connection to his 
Scottish roots. Gowan is currently having the time of his 
life touring the U.S. with STYX, alongside other legend-
ary rock acts Joan Jett & The Blackhearts and Tesla. 
On July 14, their tour will be heading to Pittsburgh at 
the Keybank Pavilion, and Gowan was happy to share 
some of his experiences and hopes for the tour.
M: How’s your experience touring with Joan 
Jett & The Blackhearts, Tesla, and your other 
band members?
LG: I would recommend it to anyone. If that opportunity 
ever comes your way I would highly recommend it. 
Whatever you’re doing in life, I would consider drop-
ping that and getting on board with something like this. 
That’s how much fun I have doing it.
M: What’s your favorite song and/or songs to 
perform?
LG: [“Renegade”] is one of the songs Tommy Shaw 
sings lead on and it’s always towards the end of the 
night. I had great experiences with that song with just 
observing where the audience is at emotionally; they’re 
so effusive in their emotive state, no matter where we 
play around the world. I’ve seen audiences that start 
out a show very differently in Japan or Sweden or 
England or America and yet they’re all so alike by the 
time we get to the end of the night and that’s usually 
[with] “Renegade”. So that always kind of holds its 
attraction to me as the most fun song for me to play 
because I really get to enjoy [the song] from an audi-
ence perspective as much as a band perspective at that 
point... It’s just one of these marvelous things that I’ve 
witnessed in life, where it really speaks to the universal 
language of what music can do to people and how 
alike we are in our response to it when it meets our 
expectations or when it goes well beyond them.
M: Wow, that’s amazing! And that also says a 
lot about STYX and how the band’s music can 
really move people across the world.
LG: It really does speak to that, and why wouldn’t it? 
You know, classic rock or rock music is a gigantic musi-
cal statement of the last half of the twentieth century, 
and that’s indisputable. It really had a profound impact 
on such a large part of the planet, you might even say 
the entire planet, to where these songs are not just the 
soundtracks to [people’s] lives, but they are like a vibra-
tional call to their very existence. I mean, that sounds 
way overstated, but I witness it all the time so I can’t 
deny its existence. People really do have this deep 
and abiding love for this type of music. It’s gone well 
beyond being a fad, it’s much more a part of the fabric 
of their lives.
M: I heard you’ll be performing the band’s hit 
“Mr. Roboto” when you come to Pittsburgh. 
What are you most looking forward to in that 
performance?
LG: Well we’ve been playing it for a few weeks, so I 
look forward to playing it every night. I really enjoy 
doing the song and I love watching the audience’s reac-
tion to it. It’s really a song that’s lasted and it’s well into 
its fourth decade of existence. Some people make some 
smiles and it pushes a button in people that I enjoy 
pushing.
M: Could you explain the evolution of the 
band’s music over the years?
LG: One of the things I love about STYX music is that 
it always had a bit of a classical underpinning to its 
structure and the way it’s approached. I’m in my 
twentieth year in the band right now. I studied classical 
music growing up, and I actually got a degree in clas-
sical piano but with the intention of bringing it back to 
rock. But it’s that aspect of it, and the lofty pathos that 
goes into a lot of classical music, that is in a lot of STYX 
music. That’s something that’s been an ongoing and 
developing thematic part of the band.
Gowan then begins to talk about the unique combina-
tion of pop, rock, and classical music genres often 
found in STYX music, and how it’s used in their most 
recent and highly acclaimed album, The Mission.
LG: It goes from pretty straight-ahead rock with, let’s 
say “Gone Gone Gone,” and then it runs across an 
arch of a wide emotional spectrum, and then con-
cludes, well not quite concludes, but towards the end it 
comes to a very classical piece with “Khedive.” And, 
you know, those two pieces couldn’t be further apart 
as far as emotional intention. And yet, they’ve lived 
in existence alongside each other on the same album, 
and one is kind of necessary for the other one to really 
have its moment.
M: I was listening to The Mission, and I found it 
fascinating how it tells one story but by using 
very different genres of music. I don’t really 
see that a lot in current music. So I wanted to 
know, in your opinion, when the band makes 
new music do you do your best to maintain 
your old sound or do you try to incorporate 
newer and more popular music styles from this 
generation?
LG: There’s something about the classic sound of this 
band from the era of the late ‘70s that is really reso-
nating with the younger contingency of our audience. 
Because on any given night, half the audience can 
be under 30 years of age, so they weren’t even born 
when some of the biggest STYX records were made. 
And yet, they respond to [the records] as if they’re com-
pletely concurrent with their lives. So, when we made 
The Mission, we decided, “Well look, obviously the 
audience has been with the band ever since the begin-
ning. They’re still loyal to the band and they want that 
sound; that’s the sound they’re drawn to. And then you 
have these younger people who very much are drawn 
to that sound as well. So let’s make sure that we write 
a record that sounds like a STYX record, which has all 
those particular elements that they gravitate to.” And 
that’s how The Mission was formed the way it was, and 
that’s why it wound up really doing as well as it has 
done, because it really does connect to that era.
M: I heard the band was working with a non-
profit called Rock to the Rescue while on tour. 
Could you talk a little bit about that?
LG: I’ll tell you how that began. After 9/11, everyone in 
the country and around the world felt it incumbent upon 
them to do something proactive and positive as a reac-
tion to that event and tragedy. And for us, a couple of 
months after it happened, we decided to do a concert. 
We got a bunch of classic rock acts who came and did 
it with us in a couple of cities, and we raised money, 
I think about half a million, maybe even more than 
that. But we needed a name for the charity, and so the 
name Rock to the Rescue came up and that became an 
ongoing thing for probably two or three years.
It was revived again with the idea of every city we 
play in has some charity that needs some financial 
assistance. And we come back to these cities over and 
over and over and people there have been so faithful 
to the band for decades. But it’s a small but meaningful 
gesture on our part to leave some of the money in a 
community with some, what we see as, worthy cause of 
the day.
M: What’s next for the band, in regards to the 
tour and/or new music?
LG: Well, there’s always new music. It really comes 
down to whether we carve out the time from our very 
intense touring schedule to actually go and record. But 
I would say that given the success of The Mission, some-
thing will emerge at some point if things keep going 
the way they are. We’re very much a band that stays 
focused on the day. I look at the schedule ahead and I 
see there’s always cities that we’re going to. It can look 
quite daunting quite frankly, and you can begin to look 
at it like, “Oh my god, we gotta get all this done,” but 
it doesn’t work that way. We really try to live by the 
philosophy of embracing the day and not really relying 
on, or assuming that the future is just going to simply be 
there for us to live out our plans. So we really hope to 
have a record, we hope to keep doing this basically for 
as long as our time on earth will allow.
M: Anything you’d like to the say to your fans 
in Pittsburgh before they come out to see you?
LG: Looking forward to sharing another STYX epic 
adventure with you this summer, and having Tesla and 
Joan Jett & The Blackhearts along is only going to 
make the party that much more fun. Looking forward to 
seeing everyone!

Top Ten Things I Wish I Had KnownMy First Yearwritten by Sophie Carpenter | Staffwriter
1) Laundry: Just everything related to laundry. If you were spoiled your entire life and did not have the daunting task of doing your 
own laundry, do not fret! You are definitely not the only one. I came in not knowing how to complete this task. But then, someone 
opened my eyes to these wonderful things called Tide Pods! They have both fabric softener and soap so you just pop them in with 
your laundry. The best part is you are not required to separate clothing by color (you probably still should though)!
2) Sleep should be a priority: Your bed will be the best place to spend time after a long day. Sleep is vitally important in college. 
There are plenty of times to hang with friends and enjoy life, but take it from me, staying up late will not be your best friend during 
the week. With new classes, workload, and a different lifestyle, you will need some time to unwind and relax. Keep in mind, that 
there will no longer be someone directing you to bed, so it is up to you to be your own boss. :)
3) Trying new activities will open doors: I think this has to be the most generic piece of advice that you will hear continuously over 
your entire life, but it’s true! For example, my freshman year, I tried Ballroom Dance! I ended up loving the classes so much that 
I started competing on the team and have met some of the most amazing people through the club. College is a great time to try 
new and exciting things! Step outside of your comfort zone!
4) Homework should come first: I truly sound like a parent for this one but I feel that I didn’t always take this into account. You 
will experience copious hours of free time (primarily in the evenings) in which you are available to do what you choose. Choosing 
activities wisely is important.
5) Nutrition is key: When you leave home, there will no longer be someone instructing you on what to eat or when to eat. It is all 
up to you now! As silly as this sounds, you will get out of your body what you put in. If you eat nutritional and healthy foods with 
occasional treats, then you will benefit far more with energy as well as being attentive in class. And trust me, it will be challenging 
and new, but it is all part of the experience.
6) Exercise is a good form of relieving stress: I love sports and I always have, so for me exercising was always on my radar, but 
for some it is not. Regardless, if you are obsessed with sports or not, exercising for even half an hour will help reduce stress and 
also help you sleep better! For my freshman year, I wish I had taken more advantage of our amazing facilities in the Cohon Center 
and around the campus!
7) Taking advantage of opportunities on campus: There are a TON of opportunities on campus to take advantage of! For 
example, you can take part in one of the 200+ clubs run by students! There are also school jobs, student ambassador rolls, and 
student council as well!
8) You will not need as much clothing as you think: Trust me on this one. You may think that you need all these different options for 
clothing, but the reality of it is you will most likely be wearing the same outfit or cycle of outfits every week.
9) Utilize the benefits that come with your Student ID: Your Carnegie Mellon Student ID comes with so many benefits! For 
example, it is your entry pass on public transportation! Additionally, it will get you into some of the museums in Pittsburgh for free 
or at a discounted price! I wish I took more advantage of this during my first year.
10) Explore your city: Pittsburgh! Pittsburgh is an amazingly wonderful city with much to offer. For example, Phipps Conservatory, 
the Andy Warhol Museum, Heinz Field, Schenley Park, PPG Place, and much more! I personally wish that I had gotten to see more 
of my surroundings during the year so make sure to take advantage of that this year!
Good luck!
