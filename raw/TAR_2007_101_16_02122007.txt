Study abroad program 
a success, students say
by Veronica Milliner
Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon students 
are enhancing their college ex­
perience by packing their bags 
and heading abroad, according 
to the most recent study by the 
University’s International Com­
mittee.
The study, published in August 
2006, shows “academic, global, 
and personal benefits” for stu­
dents who venture abroad, said 
Paul Goodman, International 
Committee chairman.
Of the students surveyed who 
went abroad in 2006, 99 percent 
said that they would choose to 
do so again.
Students cited learning about 
a new country, meeting new 
people, gaining self confidence, 
and learning a new language as 
the greatest advantages of time 
spent abroad.
“Educationally, it gives stu­
dents a different perspective,” 
said Amber Mercier, a repre­
sentative for the Institute for 
the International Education of 
Students (IES). IES offers 30 
specialized programs and in­
ternship opportunities in 16 
countries, according to its web­
site.
The survey results support 
Mercier’s assertion: 43 percent
of students surveyed reported 
an improved understanding 
of their major and 52 percent 
reported improved second lan­
guage skills.
•Students are able to use this 
knowledge in future job op­
portunities that are constantly 
pushing for more international 
experience and creative ap­
proaches to problem solving.
Mercier believes that living in 
another country has a positive 
impact on students.
“Students talk more about the 
personal — about adjusting and 
thinking outside the box,” she 
said.
Students agreed: 75 percent 
stated that studying abroad in­
creased their self confidence and 
74 percent reported an improved 
understanding of themselves.
“I gained a much wider view of 
the world,” stated Amy Suntoke, 
a junior ethics, history, and pub­
lic policy major, via e-mail.
Suntoke participated in the 
DIS program in Copenhagen, 
Denmark during the fall 2006 
semester.
“There are so many impor­
tant things, both political and 
cultural, that we don’t pay much 
attention to, but yet still have a 
big impact in the international 
arena,” she said. “When I re-

Look out, Luke: Peduto puts in bid for mayor
by Ben Hackett
Staffwriter
Pittsburgh City Councilman 
William Peduto announced his 
run for mayor in front of a large 
crowd of supporters on January 
22 at the Union Project in High­
land Park. Peduto, a 42-year-old 
Point Breeze resident, is incum­
bent Luke Ravenstahl’s major 
competition in the Democratic 
primary in the upcoming special 
election on May 15.
A veteran of western 
Pennsylvania politics, Peduto 
is currently serving his second 
term on the city council. In 2005, 
he finished second to Mayor Bob
O’Connor in the Democratic 
mayoral primary.
Peduto’s prior western 
Pennsylvania political experi­
ence includes serving as chief 
of staff to City Councilman Dan 
Cohen for seven years and op­
erating a political consulting 
business covering 25 counties.
Peduto’s vision for Pittsburgh’s 
future includes a primary focus 
on the individual neighborhoods.
1 His plans include refocusing the 
role of the Urban Redevelop­
ment Authority (URA) by re­
orienting the URA’s focus away 
from larger-scale projects and 
onto neighborhoods. Peduto 
also favors an equitable system 
of tax incentives for downtown
residential development. Peduto 
cited Philadelphia and Colum­
bus, Ohio, as examples of simi­
lar development approaches, 
and believes that this incentive 
method can work similarly for 
Pittsburgh.
Peduto has also been ac­
tive in issues affecting college- 
age individuals. When he was 
first elected, Peduto created a 
research fellowship aimed at 
aiding Pittsburgh youth research 
on local issues. As a councilman, 
one of his first actions was to pro­
vide funding for the UV Loop bus 
route. In addition, Peduto also 
led a movement to reschedule the 
District Three special election to 
allow the return of local students
from spring break activities.
In early mayoral campaign 
donation filings, Peduto lagged 
behind incumbent Ravenstahl in 
overall fundraising, particularly 
in donations larger than $1000. 
Peduto has trended toward gar­
nering fewer large donations 
from traditional Pittsburgh po­
litical players. Yet, he still enjoys 
support throughout the greater 
Pittsburgh community.
The Tartan was able to secure 
Peduto’s time for a question and 
answer session.

Jeannette Wing will leave CMU this July for a position with the NSF.
Ashish Arora was one of 15 people chosen to explore the economic benefits of innovation. The committee will meet for the first time next week.
by Annika Rosenvinge
Junior Staffwriter
Call it an innovation. On 
December 6, Ashish Arora, a 
professor of economics and pub­
lic policy at the Heinz School, 
was one of 15 business and aca­
demic leaders appointed by U.S. 
Secretary of Commerce Carlos
Gutierrez to a new panel to study 
the economic benefits of innova­
tion in business.
The committee, named the 
Measuring Innovation in the 
21st Century Economy Advi­
sory Committee, will develop a 
method of measuring innovation 
that will allow policymakers and 
the public to better understand 
innovation’s impact on economic
growth and productivity, accord­
ing to a press release from the 
Department of Commerce.
Arora defined innovation in 
this context as being not so much 
technical innovation — specific 
advances and developments in 
software and hardware — but 
rather the ways in which busi­
nesses structure their internal 
and external workings, which
Arora called “organizational in­
novations.”
The committee’s goal is to fig­
ure out a way to measure these 
innovations systematically in 
order to provide guidance or 
recommendations about the 
role of such innovations in fu­
ture American business activity,

your inquiry, as well as 
the date of the issue and

issue and publish it online.
In last week’s Pillbox 
feature article, “The New 
Pittsburgh Courier: a history 
in images,” the Courier's cura­
tor was incorrectly identified 
as Jim Brewer. The subject’s 
name is John Brewer. In ad­
dition, Brewer found the 
Courier photographs in 2005, 
not 1995.
The feature photo on the 
back cover of last week’s 
Pillbox issue was incorrectly 
attributed to Jiaqi Tan. The 
photographer was Zhiquan 
Yeo.
Last week’s Science and 
Technology article, “Carnegie 
Mellon theorist creates test
for string theory,” stated that 
it is an Effective Field Theory. 
This is incorrect; string theory 
is only one possible ultravio­
let completion of an existing 
Effective Field Theory. The 
same article stated that the 
paper relies on the detection 
of a light Higgs boson; this 
is not, in fact, the main focus 
of the experiment. The pri­
mary focus of the experiment 
is to measure the scatter­
ing of W-bosons. It relies on 
the absence of a light Higgs 
boson, and if one is found a 
different method would have 
to be pursued.
In last week’s news article, 
“The $60 Billion Problem,” a 
photo caption identified the 
CEO of SureLogic as Scott 
Schmidt. The subject’s name 
is Steve Schmitt. In addition, 
the article incorrectly stated 
that prior to SureLogic, 
Schmitt was the CEO of FORE 
systems. He was the VP for 
Information Technology at 
FORE Systems. In addition, 
the company’s name is printed 
SureLogic, not Sure Logic.

In the words of early 20th century 
femme fatale Marlene Dietrich, “Sex. In 
America, an obsession. In other parts of 
the world, a fact.”
Sex has become a ubiquitous part of 
U.S. culture, even to the point where 
mentioning so is now cliche. But it’s not 
necessarily true that everyone is sexu­
ally active, or comfortable with current 
sexual conventions.
Every culture has its outiiers, and 
it’s a common misconception that at 
left-brained universities like Carnegie 
Mellon, students are too busy with their 
faces buried in a book to find themselves 
buried in their partner’s embrace.
This notion has only been com­
pounded by the negative publicity 
Carnegie Mellon received in 2005 for 
showing a pornographic movie, an 
event which was aired to the public 
in a report conducted by KDKA. The 
public image was embarrassingly clear 
— Carnegie Mellon is full of sexually 
frustrated single men and women.
Hopefully this week’s issue of Pillbox 
will put that belief to rest. When you 
take a look at the content of the issue, 
you will see that every piece of content 
is united by a common theme — it’s all 
sexed up.
The annual sex issue is a time for The 
Tartan to strike up a conversation with 
the Carnegie Mellon community that is 
rarely conducted on campus. Hopefully, 
your curiosity will be aroused by the 
paper’s content. I hope the sex issue 
helps to answer any questions you’ve 
always been wondering about the op­
posite sex, or same sex, even.
But the issue isn’t just about teaching 
the dating-challenged how to get their 
groove on. It’s also not an avant-garde 
rag chocked full of raunchy material 
(though, if you’re into that, Dossier 
Design Editor Kristen Lukiewski was 
able to procure an interview with celeb­
rity porn star Ron Jeremy, and it goes 
down on page B13).
Hopefully the sex issue serves a 
greater purpose as a cultural ther­
mometer. I like to think that the issue 
acknowledges that students (and 
faculty? we don’t like to pry) have a 
healthy appetite for romantic activities, 
including sex.
The sex issue contains a valuable col­
lection of tips for dating, breaking up,. 
talking to your partner once you’re in 
a relationship, and even “engineering” 
the occasional hookup for those who 
choose to stay single.
The issue also contains valuable ker­
nels of secret information regarding 
how boys and girls typically think.
And what better source for that in­
formation than your own college 
newspaper, which is teeming with col­
lege-aged writers and editors who have 
all experienced some of the sticky situ­
ations and pure thrills associated with 
dating during college?
The sex issue aims to get sex out in 
the open. I am not advocating the sud­
den onslaught of public intercourse on 
campus (It’s very cold outside, and I 
don’t want to be liable for any frost­
bite.)
What I mean to say is, this campus 
should not be afraid to have a lengthy 
dialogue about subjects that are often 
regarded as taboo.
Perhaps I am overstepping my 
bounds by saying so, but if we finally 
reach a point where sex is discussed 
comfortably, then perhaps next time a 
pornographic movie is shown on cam­
pus, people will be too busy getting busy 
to show up.
As for the sex issue, maybe it will 
become obsolete. I’m not saying that 
the issue is the panacea for all sexual 
problems, but hopefully it will answer 
some of your questions.
Have a happy, healthy Valentine’s 
Day.

Wing appointed to NSF position
WING, from A1
focus on software security. She is 
especially interested in how sys­
tem components not originally 
designed to work together can 
lead to surprising behavior when 
combined.
“Her research is very well- 
regarded and widely recognized 
by the academic community and 
by the industry,” said Carnegie 
Mellon President Jared L. Cohon. 
“Jeanette has been a central fig­
ure in the University’s excellent 
relationship with Microsoft.”
During her time at Carnegie 
Mellon, Wing has greatly en­
hanced the Carnegie Mellon 
experience for students in the 
department of computer sci­
ence through her administrative 
skills, revamping of the curri­
cula, and the development of a 
distance-learning program.
In terms of education, Wing 
keeps two things in mind: keep­
ing curricula fresh, up-to-date, 
and relevant, and ensuring that 
people get their fundamentals, 
she stated in a July 2006 article 
in IEEE Spectrum. If a student 
has strong foundations, he or she 
can do practically anything, she 
believes.
Wing is not only focused on 
education at Carnegie Mellon 
but has a strong interest in spark­
ing elementary and high school 
students’ interest in math and 
science.
“She is very passionate about 
education,” Cohon said. “She has 
been a leading proponent of what 
she calls ‘computational literacy’ 
for all, starting with school-age 
children. She is an excellent role 
model for women in science and 
engineering, and she is a staunch 
advocate for sustaining diversity 
in all of its dimensions.”
Although a realistic thinker, 
Wing clearly stated that she has 
a grand vision for the world. She 
admits that she is partly biased, 
coming from computer science. 
But in her ideal world, she would 
have everyone be able to think 
computationally, Wing said in 
IEEE Spectrum.
“Carnegie Mellon is very proud 
of Jeanette and her appointment 
at NSF to one of the most impor­
tant and influential positions 
in the information technology 
world,” Cohon said.
Since its creation in 1950, 
NSF has been one of the lead­
ing independent organizations 
responsible for distributing the 
majority of federal funding in 
mathematics, computer science, 
and the social sciences. The NSF 
receives an annual budget of ap­
proximately $5.58 million, some 
of which goes towards backing 
about 20 percent of all federally 
supported research conducted at 
colleges and universities.
In her new role, Wing will be 
responsible for determining the 
breakdown of a $527 million
budget that finances approxi­
mately 86 percent of all federally 
funded research in computer 
science. She will also be appro­
priating money and resources 
toward educating and training 
future computer scientists and 
engineers.
When Wing assumes her role 
in the NSF directorate, she will 
join a line of Carnegie Mellon 
faculty and alumni who have oc­
cupied the position. Peter Free­
man, who currently holds the 
position, received his Ph.D. in 
computer science at Carnegie 
Mellon in 1970. Freeman’s prede­
cessors include William Wulf, a 
former member of the computer 
science faculty, and Gordon Bell, 
who taught both computer sci­
ence and electrical engineering 
at Carnegie Mellon.
“We have a history of Carnegie 
Mellon faculty occupying this 
role with NSF and we are glad 
that it will now be in her hands,” 
Bryant said. “It is such an im­
portant position for computer 
science.”
As for who will replace Wing 
for the time she is away from 
campus, SCS is forming a search 
committee to find and hire a new 
candidate by the beginning of 
July.
“It will be difficult for us to lose 
her, even for a limited period,” 
Cohon said. “We look forward 
to her return after she completes 
her NSF service.”
Students suggest studying abroad
ABROAD, from A1
turned, I also had a better under­
standing of the U.S. and our way 
of life here.”
Approximately 86 percent of 
the students surveyed reported 
an improved understanding of 
cultural differences after study­
ing abroad.
“Being in a foreign country 
and being forced to take care of 
everything for yourself in a com­
pletely unfamiliar place really 
gives you a sense of confidence,” 
Suntoke stated.
According to the survey, 75 
percent of students experienced 
improved self-confidence upon 
their return from abroad.
These changes often have a 
positive effect on the student’s 
subsequent performance at Carn­
egie Mellon, said Eva Mergner, 
senior coordinator for study 
abroad and exchange programs 
at Carnegie Mellon.
“They feel more independent, , 
more aware of themselves, open 
to new experiences, and new 
people. That stuff bleeds over 
into the academic,” Mergner 
said.
According to Mergner, return­
ing students are able to “under­
stand problems from a different 
approach” and possess “a sense 
of the world and how the U.S. fits 
in.”
Mergner highlighted many 
programs that have interested 
Carnegie Mellon students in the 
past. For engineering students, 
she suggested an exchange pro­
gram through Aachen University 
of Technology in Germany that 
allows students in engineer­
ing to take classes and conduct 
research. She also cited the 
programs through the School 
for International Training 
(SIT) and the architecture pro­
grams through Lexia as popular 
choices.
In addition to the academic 
and cultural benefits of studying 
abroad, the survey also indicated 
that students also view the expe­
rience as a chance to take a break 
from the intense schedule and 
heavy course load at Carnegie 
Mellon.
However, this often means 
students that find it hard to re­
adjust to Carnegie Mellon upon 
their return.
“I think it was rather difficult 
to assimilate back into the CMU
lifestyle. You tend to feel frus­
trated and sometimes alienated 
from your friends and family,” 
Suntoke stated. “However, once 
you really start to digest your 
experience and accept that you 
are in fact back in the U.S., these 
feelings disappear.”
To ease the transition, the OIE 
holds mandatory pre-departure 
and post-return sessions for 
study abroad students to address 
concerns that'students may have 
about living in another coun­
try, from the administrators in 
charge of the trip to health and 
safety issues and potential cul­
tural differences students may 
experience once abroad.
Despite potential pitfalls, the 
results of the survey indicated 
that, overall, students viewed 
studying abroad as one of the 
most educational and valuable 
experiences of their college 
years.
The OIE, located on the third 
floor of Warner Hall, will hold 
an open house Friday at 3 p.m. 
Students can enjoy snacks while 
meeting OIE staff and students 
who have studied abroad, learn 
about the programs offered, and 
ask any questions.

THE TARTAN • FEBRUARY 12, 2007
Peduto to run for mayor this spring
PEDUTO, from Al
local affairs? On the local level, 
should it matter what a candi­
date’s stances are on national 
affairs?
Peduto: Historically, move­
ments surrounding issues that 
affect our nation often begin [on 
the] local level. I am proud of 
the resolutions I have sponsored 
bringing to light issues like the 
war in Iraq, the Patriot Act, and 
genocide in Darfur.
The Tartan: What attracts you 
to Pittsburgh politics? What is it 
about Pittsburgh that is unique?
Peduto: Pittsburgh’s 88 unique 
neighborhoods give this city a 
distinct flavor. Pittsburgh is a 
city with great opportunities; it 
is not a city in decline, but a city 
in transition. We have the unique 
opportunity to preserve the 
distinct characteristics of each 
neighborhood, while promoting 
the emerging new economy and 
growth sectors being advanced 
by the ed-med community.
The Tartan: In your opinion, 
what needs to be done concern­
ing PAT to make it viable in the 
future and functional now?
Peduto: As a commissioner on 
thè Southwestern Pennsylvania 
Commission, I helped to craft 
a 20-year strategic plan for a 
world-class public transportation 
system in southwestern Pennsyl­
vania. We must approach public 
transportation as a regional con­
cern, not simply an Allegheny 
County concern. We should cre­
ate new a regional, multi-modal 
transit authority that reinvests in 
our older communities and fol­
lows the model of a new economy
— moving worker to workplace 
for economic growth.
The Tartan: Specifically,
please describe what you meant 
when you said at your announce­
ment rally that the city “needs 
independent leadership to dis­
mantle the political machine.”
Peduto: We need indepen­
dent leadership that will serve 
the masses and not cater to the 
powerful few. [The Democratic 
Party] was founded by and 
should be run by the people, not
a small cabal. The Democratic 
Party, most elected officials, and 
the elected committee people 
that serve the party understand 
the principles that this is a party 
for all, not one driven by back­
room politics and a pay-to-play 
system.
The Tartan: What are the real 
differences between you and 
Mayor Ravenstahl concerning 
politics, policy, and the future 
development of Pittsburgh?
Peduto: On social issues, I 
have supported a progressive 
agenda, and on fiscal issues, I 
have always remained responsi­
ble. I was the first elected official 
to call for Act 47. Additionally, 
I have promoted smart urban 
growth and community-based 
plans for neighborhood rede­
velopment. This has included 
legislation to promote green 
buildings, historic preservation, 
and providing a greater voice to 
the community on the issues that 
affect their respective neighbor­
hoods.
The Tartan: In the Democratic 
primary in the last election, some 
say that your campaign marketed 
itself towards the young profes­
sional and college student crowd. 
If you share this view, why was 
this the campaign’s focus?
Peduto: I did not market my­
self towards college students. 
I ran an informative and clean 
campaign based on the issues
— and this attracted young 
people to my campaign. Since I 
took office, I have been a leader 
that young people have turned to 
because I am the first elected of­
ficial to invite them to the table 
and to give them a voice in local 
government.
The Tartan: No one would ar­
gue that Pittsburgh is affordable 
for a young professional. That 
said, how does Pittsburgh stop 
the brain drain of college-aged 
students leaving to work in other 
cities?
Peduto: It is important for the 
city to recognize the difference 
between real estate development 
and true economic development. 
We should not be investing pub­
lic dollars into a Wal-Mart being

City Councilman Bill Peduto plans to run in the mayoral election this May.
built in Greenfield, but instead 
we should invest in new job 
clusters that provide economic 
growth. The mills never closed, 
they simply moved up the hill. 
Our new mills are the ed-med 
community of the East End. We 
need to further invest in these 
fields and related spin-offs to 
provide jobs to keep young 
people in Pittsburgh. Certain 
investment methods that other 
cities have found successful in­
clude investment into public 
transit and workforce develop­
ment, providing incubator space 
and tax incentives to new econ­
omy jobs, and providing low-cost 
clean rooms and wet-lab space 
for start-ups to prosper.
The Tartan: How do you plan 
to collect information from local 
residents in a timely and efficient 
manner concerning problems 
and policy initiatives? If elected 
mayor, would you accept a plan 
to hold bi-monthly meetings of 
local youth leaders from busi­
ness and academia?
Peduto: There should be a 
community-developed plan im­
plemented for development in 
each of our 88 neighborhoods. 
Plans about the future of our 
neighborhoods should be made 
on Main Street, not Grant Street. 
I was instrumental in the creation 
of the Community Information 
System with Carnegie Mellon, 
the University of Pittsburgh, and 
other groups. All the information 
that is disseminated by commu­
nities will be part of larger plan 
made available to everyone. This 
information will also be utilized 
in order to hold departments 
accountable for the work that 
should be done in our communi­
ties. I would not hold bi-monthly 
meetings with local youth lead­
ers, because I do not believe the 
solution is to create a youth com­
mission. I will put young people 
and women and minorities on 
all of the city’s boards, authori­
ties, and commissions, not create 
new commissions for people. All 
people should have a voice at the 
main table.
Arora on innovation
ECON, from Al
Arora said.
Arora used Dell as an example 
of a company that practices this 
philosophy. Dell produces very 
little in the way of new technol­
ogy; the company’s innovations 
primarily have to do with devis­
ing new and more efficient ways 
to sell computers to businesses.
This kind of innovation will 
be of particular interest in the 
21st century, Arora said, which 
will cause it to become more 
prevalent.
However, the role of the com­
mittee in the field of innovation 
is still partially obscured. The 
committee will not meet for the 
first time until February 22, at 
which point members will have 
a better understanding of what 
the committee’s function will 
be, Arora said.
“[The other members are] a 
very distinguished group of busi­
ness executives, some of whom 
have gone on record speaking 
about innovation from their own 
perspective,” he said.
Arora was one of only five 
appointees drawn from the 
academic sector.
Arora said he was looking 
forward to learning about the 
nature of companies’ individual 
systems and infrastructure by 
working with the business ex­
ecutives. This information will 
be key in determining what fea­
tures are measurable in the field 
of innovation.
He is particularly looking for­
ward to talking to CEOs directly 
about their licensing technolo­
gies — an area of expertise for 
Arora — and how their licensing 
policies are changing the way 
they conduct business.
Licensing, how companies ne­
gotiate the manufacture of their 
technologies with other compa­
nies, is a major component of 
business. Innovations in efficient 
manufacturing and distribution 
can create vastly greater profit 
margins.
Though Arora is an expert 
in the function of innovation 
within an economic context, he 
is less adept at keeping up with 
the technological innovations 
themselves.
“Like many middle-aged peo­
ple, I’m quite inept at dealing 
with modern technology. I could 
not program your DVD player 
for you,” he said.
What Arora does have is ex­
tensive, prolific knowledge of 
the relationship of econom­
ics to technologically based 
industries, such as software, 
biotechnology, and chemicals, 
according to a university press 
release. Arora has made a career 
out of understanding of how in­
novations have played a pivotal 
role in shaping core trends and 
movements.
He will apply his expertise 
toward helping the committee 
understand the effects of the 
economics of innovation on a 
large scale.
While it is important for 
Americans to be aware of the 
events and changes in indus­
try and technology in order to 
ensure future success, Arora 
believes that America is already 
firmly established in the area of 
software innovation.
“The United States is ex­
tremely well-situated in a num­
ber of positions to remain the 
leading center of innovation,” 
Arora said. “We have certainly 
the best research university 
system, and a very large market 
that has been unified for a long 
time; we speak the same lan­
guage, use the same currency, 
[and] have more or less the same 
setup nationally.”
He explained that the United 
States is in a unique position 
because it draws in a large 
number of technical innova­
tors, entrepreneurs, and artists. 
In addition, the U.S. is home 
to many software companies 
whose products are used to run 
large organizations, e-mail sys­
tems, networking systems, and 
accounting.
“Software innovation relies 
heavily on being able to under­
stand what users want and how 
they want to use the software, 
and that requires being close to 
them. America is where these 
leading software users and in­
stitutions are,” Arora said. “We 
are probably going to remain on 
top, at least for the forseeable 
future.”

The program Mindkin allows users to enter their thoughts into an online social network and find people with interests similar to their own.

Class looks 
at citywide 
wireless net
by Michael M. Whiston
Science & Technology Editor
Engineering and public 
policy professor Jon Peha, 
alongside several Carnegie Mel­
lon students, presented a report 
to the Pittsburgh City Council 
last Thursday on developing a 
wireless broadband network for 
Pittsburgh.
Last semester, Peha created 
a project course to further ex­
plore the possibility of creating 
a wireless Internet network for 
the entire city of Pittsburgh. 
Seventeen undergraduate and 
four graduate students enrolled 
in the course. Those students 
came from a variety of fields, in­
cluding electrical engineering 
and public policy.
Students in the course ana­
lyzed possible models for 
Pittsburgh’s wireless network. 
The group’s analysis culmi­
nated in a report, which Peha 
and several students presented 
to the Pittsburgh City Council 
last week.
Peha said that the report 
considers the financial sustain­
ability of each wireless network 
model. It also considers how the 
wireless network may benefit 
the city by saving money and 
improving services.
Peha said that city agencies, 
for instance, could make use 
of the Wi-Fi Internet connec­
tion by creating parking meters 
that allow individuals to pay for 
parking through a credit card.
“There are a lot of cities try­
ing to figure out how to get 
city-wide Wi-Fi right now...and 
there [are] many ways that you 
might think about doing this,” 
Peha said.
DowntownPittsburghcreated 
a Wi-Fi network in September 
2005 that provides users with 
two hours of free Internet ser­
vice. Peha said that the idea to 
create a project course arose 
from previous discussion to ex­
tend wireless Internet services 
to all of Pittsburgh.
In 2004, the Information 
Communications Technologies 
Working Group, a committee 
of public officials, telecom­
munication providers, and 
representatives from non-profit 
organizations, discussed the

Since the inception in 2002 
of Friendster, an online friend­
ship network, the online social 
scene has long been defined by 
similar networking sites such as 
MySpace, Facebook, Multiply, 
and Xanga. Now, four CMU stu­
dents have unveiled a program 
that bases online friendships on 
a person’s thoughts.
Enter Mindkin, a program 
devoted to social networking 
online. Mindkin is the brainchild 
of Ph.D. students Vasco Pedro, 
Betty Cheng, and Ulas Bardak 
from Carnegie Mellon’s Lan­
guage Technologies Institute, 
and Jahanzeb Sherwani from the 
Computer Science Department.
In former online versions of 
social networks, people sim­
ply added friends’ names when 
they wanted, as long as both 
parties consented. This process 
allowed for large, sprawling so­
cial networks, but many prob­
lems surfaced. In particular, 
many people barely knew any-
thing about most people on their 
“friends list” besides what sparse 
details the friends chose to dis­
play.
As Jim Lauderback stated in 
his column for PC Magazine titled 
“Too Many Fake Friends,” “Now
I’ve got more than 50 friends 
— some of whom I barely even 
know. There’s a sense of shared 
experience and trust...that’s all 
sadly lacking on these social 
networks. Instead, friendship is 
being co-opted for more insalu­
brious purposes.”
In addition, sites such as 
fakeyourspace.com sprung up, 
where anyone could buy “fake 
friends” for their social sites, for 
the sole purpose of appearing 
more popular.
Mindkin, however, does away
with these problems altogether. 
On Mindkin, people are matched, 
quite literally, by their thoughts 
and interests, and users can only 
network with people who have 
similar thoughts or find similar 
things interesting.
People who use Mindkin put 
their thoughts into the “thought- 
stream”, which flows past the 
screen at a varying rate. The 
thoughtstream shows thoughts 
from all past users of Mindkin, 
and users can designate each 
thought as a thought they like or 
dislike. A person’s friends are de­
fined by these likes and dislikes.
More specifically, each User’s 
picture is split into a nine-piece 
jigsaw. When a user likes a 
thought from the thoughtstream, 
he or she gains a jigsaw piece
of the person who posted the 
thought. When all nine pieces 
have been assembled, or when 
someone has selected that he or 
she likes nine thoughts from the 
same person, that person be­
comes his or her Mindkin, and a 
personal profile is revealed.
“Mindkin may become a con­
tent space where you produce 
much less content, but means 
much more to you,” Pedro said. 
“Defining thoughts you like or 
dislike is a good base upon which 
to detect your interests, and this 
will allow you to form friend­
ships which go deeper than the 
surface.”
In effect, Mindkin allows peo­
ple to meet and befriend other 
people online who share similar 
thought patterns, likes, and dis­
likes, rather than the common 
methods employed by conven­
tional sites. Current sites allow 
you to see people’s interests af­
ter adding them; Mindkin first 
matches you with people with 
similar thoughts before adding 
them to your friends list.

New HIV vaccine to 
be tested in Africa
Merck & Co said that it would 
test a new HIV vaccine on HIV- 
negative patients and strain C 
HIV-positive patients in South 
Africa. The MRKAd5 HIV-1 vac­
cine prevents HIV infection or 
lowers HIV levels in infected 
patients. Three thousand HIV 
negative people between ages 
18 and 35 will participate in the 
trial.
“This test vaccine is one of 
the most promising currently 
available internationally,” said 
Anthony MBewu, president of 
the Medical Research Council. 
Currently, in South Africa, one 
out of every nine people have 
HIV.

England to use gas 
and wind energy
In the Ormonde project, 
Eclipse Energy plans to utilize 
both wind and gas energy to 
supply electricity to parts of 
northwest England. The project 
is meant to supply the majority 
of electricity through 30 wind 
turbines.
When the wind is not strong 
enough to meet the region’s 
electrical needs, power will be 
provided by Morecambe Bay’s 
gas fields on a smaller scale. The 
wind turbines will be able to gen­
erate 108 megawatts of power, 
and the gas resources will be 
able to generate 93 megawatts 
of power.

Law may fine street 
crossers with music
In New York, use of electron­
ics when crossing a street could 
become a crime. New York State 
Senator Carl Kruger is pushing 
for legislation to impose a $100 
fine on individuals who cross 
the street while listening to an 
iPod or talking on a cell phone. 
This action is in response to the 
deaths of three pedestrians who 
were trying to cross traffic in 
Brooklyn while focusing their 
attention on electronic devices.
The fine does not apply solely 
to iPods. Other popular gadgets, 
such as BlackBerries and video 
games, will be included. Kruger 
will introduce the legislation on 
Wednesday.

Brain technology 
can read minds
Researchers from the Max 
Planck Institute for Human 
Cognitive and Brain Sciences 
found that they could read the 
thoughts of people using fMRI 
technology and a customized 
computer program.
In one experiment, research­
ers asked participants to think 
about a mathematical sum or dif: 
ference. Using a process called 
multivariate pattern recogni­
tion, researchers then looked for 
certain patterns of neural activ­
ity to detect particular thoughts.
Results show that the com­
puter program could detect 
people’s intentions in 70 percent 
of participants. Researchers also 
found that people’s intentions 
are indicated in the front regions 
of the brain, whereas people’s 
calculations are indicated in the 
back parts of the brain.

How Things Work: Solar Cells
Sarah Mogin
From calculators to highway signs to 
satellites, solar power today serves a va­
riety of purposes. Solar cells, also called 
photovoltaic cells, are designed to con­
vert light into electricity.
Solar cells are made of semiconduc­
tors, most commonly silicon. Each atom 
holds 14 electrons in its three-electron 
shells, the last of which is only half full. 
The outer shell, containing only four 
electrons, has the capacity to hold eight 
electrons.
To fill the extra space in the outer 
shell, silicon atoms share electrons with 
neighboring atoms. In a given atom, the 
four outer electrons are each connected 
to a separate, neighboring shell. When 
multiple atoms share electrons, the con­
nections are called covalent bonds.
As a result, silicon atoms form what is 
known as a crystalline structure, a term 
given to describe their three-dimensional 
arrangement, where each atom shares 
electrons with four of its neighbors.
With all of its outer electrons tied up 
in bonds, pure silicon turns out to be a 
rather ineffective conductor. Unlike the 
electrons in copper and other good con­
ductors, the outer electrons in silicon are 
not free to travel.
Thus, solar cells utilize impure sili­
con. Through a process called “doping,” 
scientists create impurities in silicon by 
adding other elements to the atoms. The 
ratio of silicon atoms to other atoms is 
about one million to one.
Silicon is often doped with phospho­
rous, which holds an extra electron in 
its outer shell. Left out of the lattice of 
covalent bonds, this fifth electron is held 
in place by only a proton in the nucleus. 
This creates what is known as an n-type 
region because the extra electrons con­
stitute a free negative charge.

Solar cells absorb sunlight, causing electrons in impure silicon to move and create current.
Silicon doped with boron, on the other 
hand, contains p-type regions. Boron’s 
outer shell has three electrons, not four, 
like silicon. This lack of an electron re­
sults in an empty space, or hole, which 
has a positive charge.
Holes can move around just like free 
electrons. When a hole is created, a 
neighboring electron will shift to fill it, 
thus creating a new hole in its place.
Silicon is usually doped with both 
phosphorous and boron, creating both 
positive and negative regions within the 
silicon. Initially, these excess charges 
cancel out one another.
Furthermore, silicon absorbs sunlight 
in the form of photons, each of which 
provides an electron with a certain
amount of energy.
• Only a small percentage of incoming 
photons, though, offer enough energy to 
free the tightly bound electrons in pure 
silicon. The electrons in doped silicon, 
however, are much more easily freed.
Once free, electrons move to the 
p-type region, where they are able to re­
combine with holes in the atoms’ outer 
shells. Similarly, free holes are able to 
travel to the n-type region.
The area where the n- and p-type re­
gions meet is called the p-n junction, 
and it permits current flows to move 
in one direction. Electrons and holes 
move only to the p- and n-type regions, 
respectively.
After enough charge has been trans­
ferred, a region across the p-n junction 
called the depletion zone is formed. 
Here, all the holes have been filled by 
electrons; there is no longer any free 
charge. Additionally, mobile electrons 
and holes on either side of the depletion 
zone become unable to pass through it.
A buildup of negative charge in the 
n-type region and positive charge in 
the p-type region creates an electric 
field. Given an external conduction 
path connecting the n- and p-type re­
gions, electrons will flow through it 
toward the p-type region.
This migration of electrons produces 
current, and the electric field creates 
voltage, or potential difference. The 
power supplied is simply the product of 
these two quantities.
To increase their effectiveness, solar 
cells contain two additional layers. The 
first layer is an antireflective coating to 
reduce the amount of photons lost to re­
flection.
Every photon that reaches a so­
lar cell is absorbed, at least tempo­
rarily. When a photon is reflected, it 
is immediately reemitted, without dis­
placing any electrons.
Additionally, most solar cells have 
glass cover plates, which serve as shields 
against weather damage.
Though the sun might seem like 
the most inexpensive source of 
power, constructing and maintaining 
a solar-powered home is anything but 
cheap. A solar-powered home requires 
an inverter to convert direct current 
(DC) to alternating current (AC), which 
is the type of current all household ap­
pliances are designed to handle.
Additionally, the setup requires spe­
cial batteries called deep-cycle batteries, 
which are able to produce large amounts 
of power for long amounts of time. These 
batteries need a charge control to pre­
vent over-charging or over-draining.

Mindkin selectively filters thoughts based on a user’s likes and dislikes.
MINDKIN, from A6
“There was initially a certain 
amount of concern about the 
safety of a global thoughtstream 
to which everyone is free to con­
tribute. But we’re not censoring 
anything at all,” Cheng said. “The 
entire concept of the Internet is 
free speech and thought, and 
we understand people’s need for 
freedom. However, we do have 
a filter system in place, which
checks for extreme cases such as 
very racist comments, which are 
perhaps the only sort of thing we 
might censor.”
“We’re working on the concept 
of a thought having ‘energy,’ gain­
ing energy as more people like it, 
and losing energy as people dis­
like it.” Bardak said. “There will 
definitely be multiple things de­
termining how a thought recycles 
in the stream; thoughts with high 
energy will recycle more often.”
This process would eventu­
ally allow Mindkin to become 
regulated by the users. Offen­
sive comments, such as racist 
slurs or curses, would be quickly 
drowned out if many people dis­
liked them.
The team is revising and 
improving the algorithm for 
selective filtering of thoughts. 
Mindkin operates on an algo­
rithm which filters thoughts into 
categories and actively displays 
more thoughts from categories 
which a user likes as determined 
from previous choices. The team 
realized that this was a necessity if 
Mindkin goes worldwide to allow 
people to deal with the volume of 
incoming thoughts from people 
all around the world. However, 
a random element will always be 
present to show thoughts from 
the global thoughtstream.
“We might create separate 
thoughtstreams for different spe­
cific groups,” Pedro explained. “It 
would be a sort of convergence, 
where people who enjoy simi­
lar things gradually see similar 
thoughts in their streams, and 
form their own community. The 
idea is to have small groups of 
true friends.”
The team said that they hope to 
expand Mindkin to handheld de­
vices, allowing users to plug into 
the thoughtstream from wher­
ever there is Wi-Fi.
One notable thought floating 
in the thoughtstream, which may 
become the tagline for Mindkin at 
Carnegie Mellon, stated: “Mind­
kin = e-fence, without having to 
spend the night out in the cold!” 
Mindkin is currently only open 
to Carnegie Mellon students. 
However, the team hopes to re­
lease the program to the public in 
the near future.
Mindkin is currently only view­
able on Internet Explorer. Due to 
overwhelming public demand, 
though, support for other brows­
ers will be added in the future;. 
In fact, support for Firefox is ex­
pected to be available at press 
time.
Pedro said that Associate Dean 
of Student Affairs Paul Fowler 
had been especially helpful to 
the team’s work so far. “He was 
always supportive and made ev­
erything go smoothly for us,” 
Cheng added. “We wouldn’t be 
here without his help.”

possibility of creating a wireless 
network for Pittsburgh. The de­
velopment of a wireless network, 
however, never advanced beyond 
the discussion phase.
Peha said that the various 
models contained in the class’s 
report outline different roles for 
companies and non-profit orga­
nizations.
“These models in our analysis 
achieve some of the goals in some 
manner or another,” said Daniel 
Gurman, a master’s student in 
electrical and computer engi­
neering who took the course.
Wi-Fi networks consist of 
multiple radio transmitters that 
communicate with one another. 
As a result, people can access 
the Internet virtually anywhere 
within the network. It is usu­
ally easier, though, to access the 
Internet outdoors because the
signal is stronger.
Wi-Fi networks allow comput­
ers with the appropriate wireless 
hardware to receive information 
from the Internet via wireless 
routers. Wi-Fi networks send out 
high-frequency radio waves that 
are unlicensed, meaning that 
they are available to the public.
According to a 2004 Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette article, the Informa­
tion Communications committee 
concluded that “the question is 
not when but if the city should 
jump on the bandwagon with 
other U.S. municipalities that 
are starting to provide the public 
with inexpensive wireless Inter­
net access.”
Baton Rouge, La., and Austin, 
Texas, are two of the many cities 
that currently provide free Wi-Fi 
Internet to the public. To access 
the free Internet service, users 
must be in a hot spot, or area of 
the city that has a strong Internet
signal.
According to the research 
group’s presentation, the esti­
mated cost to deploy and operate 
a wireless broadband network for 
the first year is $3 million. Fur­
thermore, the estimated revenue 
during the first year is $3.4 mil­
lion.
Having presented the report to 
the Pittsburgh City Council last 
week, Peha said that Councilman 
Bill Peduto expressed interest in 
the creation of a citywide Wi-Fi 
network.
“It seems like there’s a number 
of parties that are interested in 
moving forward,” Gurman said.
In its report, the Carnegie Mel­
lon research team focused on the 
costs and benefits of Pittsburgh’s 
broadband network.
A citywide duopoly, for in­
stance, involves the establishment 
of two Wi-Fi providers for all of 
Pittsburgh. After comparing the

costs and revenues of the model, 
however, the group concluded 
that it would not break even 
within five years.
Alternatively, smaller pro­
viders could serve separate 
neighborhoods. The downside of 
that model, though, is that low- 
income neighborhoods might not 
receive wireless capability.
In their presentation last 
Thursday, Peha and his stu­
dents outlined several goals 
for Pittsburgh’s wireless net­
work, including ubiquitous 
coverage, competition among 
providers, and minimal cost.
According to the Post-Ga­
zette, Verizon lobbied against 
the creation of a wireless Inter­
net network in 2004 because of 
its cheap prices compared to the 
price of high-speed Internet.
Speaking of Verizon’s opposi­
tion to the project, Peha said, “It 
is certainly an issue that the city

will have to deal with.” However, 
he said that the report’s review 
panel, which comprised mainly 
city leaders, included Verizon.
Peha will be continuing the 
project next semester with a 
smaller group of students as an
independent study.
Gurman said that there are 
other aspects of the wireless net­
work that may be explored.
“There’s a lot more work and 
a lot more options that could be 
analyzed,” Gurman said.

Jockstraps and tampons
Coed housing pilot addresses campus necessity
Jock straps in the laundry bin, 
tampons cluttering the medicine cabi­
net: When you’re living with a member 
of the opposite sex, what else could go 
wrong?
Besides those kinds of minor incon­
veniences, we don’t see a problem with 
mixed-gender housing. Students al­
ready live in areas coed by floor and 
wing; coed by room seems like the next 
logical step.
There are two reasons to support 
mixed-gender housing at Carnegie 
Mellon: a need and a want. The need ad­
dresses LGBT students who may prefer 
to have a roommate of the opposite sex. 
The want is for the university to respect 
our capabilities, as adults, to make ma­
ture decisions about who we want to live 
with.
The assumption that all students 
would be more comfortable living 
with a roommate of the same gender 
is outdated. For gay and lesbian stu­
dents, there’s the risk of encountering 
a homophobic roommate as well as the 
possibility of becoming attracted to their 
roommate. A housing proposal submit­
ted to The Daily Gazette, a newspaper 
at Swarthmore College, cited these rea­
sons and others as motivating factors for 
gender-neutral housing.
Swarthmore currently offers coed 
housing in all forms, including apart­
ments, suites, and even doubles. Ac­
cording to an article in The Phoenix, 
Swarthmore’s online student newspa­
per, the school was making plans to
expand its gender-neutral housing op­
tions as recently as last spring.
Besides the potential benefits for LGBT 
students, coed housing is often associ­
ated with the stereotypical roommate 
nightmare: If a heterosexual couple de­
cides to live together, what happens if 
they break up?
It’s a valid concern; things could get 
messy. Still, it’s a misconception to be­
lieve that the potential for drama in a 
living situation is exclusive to roommates 
of the opposite sex. If a pair of same-sex 
friends decides to live together, what 
happens if they have a fight?
When choosing a roommate, it’s 
always important to keep the future 
in mind. An oft-repeated tip for room 
draw is that it’s a good idea to live with 
a friend, not a best friend. If a student, 
regardless of gender, makes a poor 
roommate choice, it’s the student’s fault
— not the system’s.
Not everyone is comfortable with 
the idea of coed housing, but we be­
lieve in the possibility of a proposal that 
could take into account these students’ 
concerns. Karl Sjogren and Andrea 
Hamilton’s current initiative for a hous­
ing pilot beginning in fall 2007 is one 
such proposal.
According to the proposal, no student 
would ever be forced to live with a mem­
ber of the opposite sex. If part of the 
support for gender-neutral housing is to 
honor student preferences, then prefer­
ences belonging to students who would 
prefer to live with same-sex roommates
are just as valid.
In addition, coed housing would not 
be offered to first-year students. The 
pilot would be restricted to only those 
upperclassmen interested in participat­
ing.
Even if the housing pilot does not suc­
ceed in providing comfortable housing 
for coed cohabitation, any potential dis­
comfort will be confined to a small part 
of our university housing system: the 
small Oakland Community Apartments. 
Apartment-style living is a good place to 
start; while adjusting to the new situa­
tion, participating students will have an 
optimal amount of room.
Haverford College has offered coed 
apartment options since 2000, as re­
ported in an article in the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette. Students sign up for coed 
housing in groups, and the adminis­
tration chooses not to monitor which 
students (of which genders) sleep in 
each bedroom.
That same article addressed the pos­
sibility of gender-neutral housing at 
Carnegie Mellon. In response to an 
article published in The Tartan, the 
Post-Gazette compared the housing 
availabilities at a number of universi­
ties, and colleges, including Swarthmore 
and Haverford.
The problem: That article was pub­
lished in 2002. Five years later, it’s time 
we stopped talking about coed housing 
and start initiating new policies. The
2007 housing pilot is our opportunity to 
do just that.
The benefits of privatizing
Pennsylvania turnpike to generate revenue for road repairs
When Pennsylvania Governor Edward 
G. Rendell announced that he might be 
looking to lease out the state’s turnpike 
to a private source, the idea of a giant 
corporation raising tolls came to mind.
However, Rendell’s proposal would 
ultimately lead to more funds, anywhere 
from $3 billion to $30 billion according 
to the turnpike’s estimated value, for the 
state to repair roads and build up the 
transportation system throughout Penn­
sylvania. The money for these repairs 
would come from the lease money that 
the private company pays to the state. 
In turn, the private company would still 
charge a toll to access the road and use 
the money from the tolls to maintain 
repairs on the turnpike. Because the
road would be leased instead of owned 
by the private company, the state’s De­
partment of Transportation would still 
retain authority over some road repairs 
and regulations.
According to an earlier report from 
the Rendell administration, Penn­
sylvania currently needs $1.7 billion 
annually, to maintain its roads, bridges, 
and public transportation system. The 
proposal to privatize the turnpike was 
one of many options that the state con­
sidered for the purpose of gathering the 
badly needed funds. These options in­
clude a 12.5-cent-per-gallon increase of 
the gasoline tax and raising the cost of 
registration and driver’s licenses. Com­
pared to an approximate 40 percent
increase of the current gasoline tax, 
privatization of the turnpike would 
cause minimal negative effects on the 
average resident.
A privately run turnpike would make 
the quality of commuting better for ev­
eryone in the state. The diverted funds 
can be used to repair state roads in need, 
as well as divert funds to the state’s prob­
lematic public transportation system.
That means that students, even those 
who don’t ever use the turnpike, are af­
fected by this, too. Student drivers will 
be able to enjoy improved roads in and 
around Pittsburgh. Giving the PAT more 
money to keep public transportation 
functioning will help students who de­
pend on Pittsbrugh’s buses.
Just butt out: Cigarettes on 
campus should go up in smoke
Justin Brown
The proposed campus-wide smoking 
ban, to take full effect by 2010, would 
be a welcome change to this university
— not because it cares about the health 
of those who choose to smoke, but for 
the benefit of those who choose not to.
I’ve always been one for personal 
choice, freedom, liberty, and all that. 
If the university imposed a ban on free 
speech or free press, the rest of the 
student population and I would be out­
raged. It wouldn’t happen. Here’s the 
difference between free speech and 
smoking cigarettes: One has the poten­
tial to further the individual and the 
community in an intellectual, social, 
and emotional manner, and the other 
has the potential to give you lung can­
cer, mouth, nose, and throat cancer, 
larynx cancer, bladder cancer, cervical 
cancer, coronary heart disease, chronic 
bronchitis, and reduced fertility, to 
name a few.
“But it’s my choice,” you may say, 
“and suicide isn’t illegal.” Murder, on 
the other hand, is. And guess who else 
gets all the benefits of the burning 
chemicals you’re inhaling? The people 
around you. According to a report by 
the World Health Organization, sec­
ondhand smoke contains over 4000 
chemicals, which include almost 70 car­
cinogens. By smoking, you are forcing 
those around you (who don’t happen to
and not have to worry about each other.
But here’s how I see it: Say I had this 
terribly contagious disease so that when 
someone without a full-body suit on 
came near me, they’d probably catch 
it, or at least start feeling some of its 
effects. Would you want me standing 
right outside the entrance to Skibo? Or 
my diseased friends and I standing in a 
cloud of contagions outside of Doherty, 
ready to smother you with plague as 
you exit the building? Would you even 
want me walking in front of you down 
the sidewalk, leaving a trail of infested 
air behind me? No, you’d probably want 
me to take my diseased self somewhere 
else; somewhere where I wouldn’t affect 
you.
Now here’s the clincher: you might 
feel a little bad for me because I have 
this terrible disease. You may be willing 
to give me some leeway and not lock me 
up in a hospital. But what if I chose to 
have this disease and it happened to be 
easily curable? What if I chose to stand 
outside the entrance of your building 
and infect you as you walked past? Be­
cause it’s my right, dammit! You would 
think I was kind of a dick. And hey,, I 
would be. ,
Just because smoking is socially 
acceptable doesn’t make its effects dis­
appear. Studies have conclusively shown 
over and over again that smoking is re­
ally, really bad for smokers and those 
who inhale it passively. It’s a smoker’s 
right to smoke at his or her leisure, even 
with full knowledge of its outcome. But 
it’s my right not to smoke or be forced to 
inhale smoke, and that doesn’t mix \ygll

deadly chemicals.
I’ve tried smoking, but I’ve never been 
addicted to it, and I’ve never used it as a 
crutch to deal with my stress. A cigarette 
craving is something I’ve never felt, and 
while I’m glad for that, I can understand 
how this would be a point of conten­
tion with someone who does smoke. 
I’m sorry you are addicted to smoking. 
I wish we could each do our own thing
with the smoker’s right. Unfortunately 
for the smoker, my right comes out on 
top. If people could smoke on campus 
without interfering with my health, that 
would be fine with me. Heated smoking

making this campus smoke free is the 
next best thing.

Critical editorial ignores The Tartan’s own mistakes
When I read The Tartan’s well-ar- 
gued editorial criticizing The Daily 
Princetonian for its bigoted attempt at 
humor in a recent “joke issue,” I kept 
waiting for the part about The Tartan’s 
own joke issue fiasco: the 2004 April 
Fools’ Day “Natrat.” Only it never came.
Am I that old? Has so much time 
passed that the Carnegie Mellon com­
munity has forgotten the national 
attention we received for our newspa­
per’s own disgusting attempt at humor, 
which ran the hateful gamut from ca­
sual use of the N-word to an infantile 
poem about violent rape?
No. It wasn’t even three years ago. 
There are surely current students, staff, 
and faculty who remember the well- 
earned fallout from that issue. As such, 
The Tartan missed a unique editorial 
opportunity to share valuable insight on 
the matter with The Daily Princetonian, 
and played a dangerous game of hypoc­
risy.
I believe The Tartan has made admi­
rable changes to its culture since April 
of 2004. Based on my reading of the 
newspaper and my time as a staffwriter, 
I will even go so far as to say that I again 
believe in the fair-mindedness of the 
news and opinion found therein. Also, I
do not believe that an organization with 
a tainted past is somehow precluded 
from criticizing other organizations at 
any given time.
But if The Tartan is to level this criti­
cism against a college newspaper whose 
foul-up bears such a striking resem­
blance to the “Natrat” fiasco, it must 
also do a service to the newer members 
of the Carnegie Mellon community and 
be actively forthcoming about its own 
failures — especially when they are so 
inarguably relevant to a potent edito­
rial. While these failures are past and 
not of the current staff’s making, the 
choice to omit any reference to them 
reeks of an attempt by The Tartan to 
whitewash history.
It was a wise man who said that if peo­
ple ignore the elephant in the room long 
enough, they won’t be able to see it any­
more. Given that ignoring the lessons 
of history helped the “Natrat” incident 
happen in the first place, that statement 
is especially apt. I urge The Tartan to 
display how it learned from the past and 
keep its history alive for our community, 
the good with the bad.

Perspectives
Bike fleets and 
equipment boxes 
come to campus
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
This week, we’re proud to 
announce one of our largest 
initiatives: starting a campus 
recreational program. The Pub­
lic Rec Program Pilot Study kicks 
off in March and will provide 
a fleet of bicycles and 10 equip­
ment boxes for students, staff, 
and faculty to use.
Bike Fleet
Through a partnership with 
Iron City Bikes, we’ll provide 
a fleet of 45 bikes for people to 
use whenever they’d like. The 
bikes won’t be locked up, won’t 
have limited periods of use, and 
won’t be restricted to certain ar­
eas of campus. The bikes will be 
large, ’50s cruiser-style bikes. 
They’ll be single speed and come 
with a double-rear basket and a 
bell. These bikes will be publicly 
available for your use, whether 
you want to ride them home, 
to the grocery store, or around 
Schenley.
Equipment Boxes
These activity boxes will be 
located at 10 different sectors 
around campus and will contain 
footballs, soccer balls, cricket 
bats, wiffle balls, plastic bats, 
and Frisbees. The boxes won’t be 
locked up and you won’t have to 
check stuff out. There will be an 
entire box of recreational equip­
ment at your disposal.
How does it work?
Both of these programs will 
rely heavily on two concepts: the 
honor system and community 
policing. Because the equipment 
, isn’t locked up, we can save thou­
sands of dollars on security costs 
and money can instead be spent 
on replenishing and replacing 
equipment. The program’s bikes 
and equipment will all be painted 
to look like a Tartan cookie, more 
or less. The program’s uniformly 
painted equiptment will bolster 
school pride, improve the pro­
gram’s visibility, and brand the 
equipment so that it will be eas­
ily identifiable and therefore less 
likely to be stolen.
So if you see a bike in some­
one’s garage or a soccer ball in 
someone’s room, you’ll know 
where it came from and it will 
be your duty to tell them to put 
it back. We’re making the goods 
publicly available and it’s up to 
you to make sure they’re left in 
good condition and easily avail­
able for the next person to use. 
The program will succeed as 
long as students support it, look 
out for it, and help police it.
This will make our campus 
community more lively, more 
mobile, and more enjoyable 
— let’s all work together to make 
sure that vision is accomplished. 
If you have any comments, ques­
tions or concerns, please don’t 
hesitate to email us sbp@.

politics: Happy Feet has no liberal agendaPenguins, not
Shawn Wertz
The Warner Brothers movie Happy Feet 
, is nominated for Best Animated Feature 
Film at the upcoming Academy Awards. 
And with the high quality of the film’s 
animation and its star-packed cast, Happy 
Feet just might win. It was pretty much a 
win since it first debuted in theaters.
After its second week at box offices 
around the world, Happy Feet grossed ap­
proximately $100 million in the United 
States, alone.
From the movie posters that show 
penguins romping through an Antarctic 
wonderland, moviegoers might expect a 
light-hearted animated children’s movie. 
However, a backlash from media pundits 
likfe Fox News’ Neil Cavuto and CNN’s 
Glenn Beck depict a different picture.
Cavuto and Beck both called the movie 
an animated An Inconvenient Truth, and 
Cavuto went as far as to say, “I half ex­
pected to see an animated version of 
A1 Gore pop up,” on his November 21
broadcast.
Yes, there are undertones of a failing 
global climate due to a polluted and ex­
ploited Earth: One of the movie’s charac­
ters becomes insane after getting his neck 
caught in a plastic ring from a six-pack 
holder; an over-fished ocean threatens the 
penguin tribe with famine. But do these 
representations go beyond the scope of 
truth and benefit the arguments of a par­
ticular political agenda?
In a world where animation software
evolves at such a rapid pace, movie audi­
ences want to see the results of new tech­
nology. The “next big animated movie” is 
released almost monthly, and audiences 
fall in love with the movies that best 
mimic life. The animated movies that win 
awards are often touted as having realis­
tic graphics.
Is it any surprise, then, that movie cre­
ators try to present a life-like experience,
even to children? Probably not. There 
wasn’t noticeable backlash when Finding 
Nemo depicted remnants of Word War II 
weaponry buried beneath the sea. There 
was no outcry from the American Obesity 
Association when recently released Mon­
ster House told the story of how the spirit 
of a morbidly obese woman possesses a 
house and wreaks havoc on a neighbor­
hood.
Happy Feet similarly alludes to the re­
alities of Antarctica’s climate: A decreas­
ing population of fish has been officially 
documented by numerous global climate 
agencies, and there have been multiple 
occurrences of wildlife being caught in 
litter.
The fact that these same environmental 
conditions are presented within the frame 
of a children’s movie doesn’t mean that 
the movie’s creators are trying to present 
a biased view of environmental policy.
Moreover, a general want for a stable 
and sustainable environment is not a want 
held by only Democrats. I never thought of 
the general Republican agenda to be one 
of malicious environmental intent. When 
the GOP supports clean-energy decisions 
like nuclear power and wind energy, it 
doesn’t depict malicious intent, either.
That pundits like Neil Cavuto and Glenn 
Beck, who typically pride themselves 
on their conservative political prowess, 
would so readily label the movie a piece of 
liberal fodder comes as a surprise to me.
If a political agenda lies in the subtext 
of a penguin movie, it does so only be­
cause those who notice it place it there 
themselves. My five-year-old cousin has a 
hard enough time keeping his shoes tied. 
I doubt then that he worries about which 
political party favors a clean environ­
ment. He doesn’t go to animated movies 
to see what issues are affecting Congress; 
he goes to them because they’re animated, 
and in the case of Happy Feet, because the 
movie is about penguins.
Shawn Wertz (swertz@) is the Publisher of 
The Tartan. He has no bias toward any ani­
mal, even if it tap dances.
I never thought of the general Republican agenda 
to be one of malicious environmental intent.

______________Benjamin Hackett
To have the ability to debate 
is a privilege unto itself. Paid for 
with the blood of our ancestors, 
the existence of movements, 
discourse, and democratic ref­
erenda on controversial topics 
is an element of liberty unique 
to progressive governance. The 
struggle in Iraq is as much about 
spreading liberty to the aver­
age Iraqi as it is about winning 
a battle in a central front in the 
war on terror. Often ignored in 
the overall struggle are com­
munities within the Middle East 
that would be most affected by a 
premature pull-out of regional 
engagement.
For our purposes here, pre­
mature pull-out means any 
surrender (called redeployment 
by Murtha-types) that eclipses 
victory.
A premature coalition with­
drawal would undoubtedly 
remove the lid on an internal 
Iraqi power struggle seemingly 
ready to boil over at the slight­
est weakening of control in the 
country. The years following a 
pull-out could lead to the deaths 
of hundreds of thousands of ci­
vilians as the Shiite, Sunni, and 
Kurdish forces battle for control 
of the country in a power vac­
uum. In calls to surrender in Iraq, 
led by the far-left sirens, Ameri­
can politicians grow increasingly 
spineless and disconnected with 
the purpose of the mission.
Ironically, in the event of sur­
render, those most affected in the 
first waves of unbuffered sectar­
ian violence would be comprised 
of a community that the left pre­
tends to care greatly about. The 
gay community in the Middle 
East faces a severe crisis in the 
radicalized portions of the re­
gion. In the past few months, the 
easily corruptible and often trou­
bled United Nations has actually 
completed some good work: It 
has published reports confirm­
ing the existence of roaming 
death squads that target and kill 
gays in Iraq, punishing them for 
the very act of homosexuality.
The United Nations Assistance
Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) pub­
lishes a Human Rights report on 
a bi-monthly basis. The last few 
reports have included a subsec­
tion on sexual orientation in 
the region. It is noted in section 
114 that “armed Islamic groups 
and militias have been known to 
be particularly hostile towards 
homosexuals, frequently and 
openly engaging in violent cam­
paigns against them. There have 
been a number of assassinations 
of homosexuals in Iraq.” While 
every day there are reports that 
frame the Iraq mission as failing, 
the reports casting the enemy in 
an accurate light are as severely 
lacking as reports on progress in 
the region.
The UN document details an 
account where “at least five ho­
mosexual males were reported 
to have been kidnapped from 
Shaab area in the first week of 
December by one of the main 
militias..'.. The mutilated body 
of Amjad, one of the kidnapped, 
appeared in the same area after 
a few days.” While these events 
continue today, imagine a situa­
tion where there was an absence 
of coalition forces securing a 
zone in Iraq. Imagine a situation 
where there was no resistance to 
a complete disintegration into 
chaos and civil war.
In the long run, allowing time 
for a coalition government to 
form’ congeal, and learn to op­
erate effectively will save lives. 
Effective coalition government 
has the power to soften the in­
fluence of Islamic law on the 
governmental structure. Minor­
ity groups in Iraq that currently 
fall out of favor with local clerics 
are tried in sham trials and often 
sentenced to death. In fact, the 
November-December UNAMI 
report details “the HRO [UNAMI 
Human Rights Office] was also 
alerted to the existence of reli­
gious courts, supervised by cler­
ics, where homosexuals alleg­
edly would be ‘tried,’ ‘sentenced’ 
to death, and then executed.” 
Furthermore, according to the 
Institute for War and Peace Re­
porting, “the trials, presided over 
by young inexperienced clerics, 
are held in ordinary halls. Gays 
and rapists face anything from 
40 lashes to the death penalty.”
It requires no additional expla­
nation to say that equating gays 
and rapists is, at the very least, 
entirely inappropriate.
By some accounts, there are 
more executions of gays now 
than during the Saddam Hussein 
regime. However, this compari­
son is flawed and fails to place 
adequate blame on the radical 
Iranian influence among Iraqi 
death squads. It is appropriate 
to note the alleged rise in slay­
ings of members of the gay com­
munity, but not as a reflection 
of a failed process. Comparing 
an established regime, however 
brutal, to an incomplete democ­
ratization process solely serves 
political interests and reeks of in 
tellectual dishonesty. Further­
more, pretending that surrender 
in Iraq is a viable solution for 
either the people of the United 
States or affected Iraq communi­
ties is an ignorant deathwish.
In the conservative movement 
there is a range of views on social 
and lifestyle issues such as gay 
marriage and adoption. Giuliani 
Republicans engage Cheney 
conservatives in intellectual de­
bates on the matter. However 
strongly they may disagree is­
sue by issue, conservatives still 
agree on one main principle: The 
answers to political problems are 
found in liberty and freedom. 
Further, conservatives who un­
derstand the ongoing effort in 
the Middle East also understand 
the repercussions of a loss in 
Iraq. To surrender in Iraq would 
not only cause mass death of in­
nocents far greater than any col­
lateral damage to date, but also 
the complete deterioration of 
the projective power of Ameri­
can foreign policy for decades to 
come.
The story of the Iraqi Muslim 
gay community underscores the 
overall struggle for democratic 
progress and freedom in the 
region. Whether differing by reli­
gion, race, or sexual orientation, 
the slayings of individuals on 
the basis of their lifestyles alone 
continues today. A successful 
mission in Iraq goes a long way 
towards securing the future of 
democracy and progressivism in 
the Middle East. The liberal posi­
tion of surrender assures future 
decades of violence and oppres­
sion against scores of civilians, 
including members of minority 
groups who liberals feign to rep­
resent. After all, in an absolute 
theocracy, there is only one in­
terest group.

Tartan tennis teams defeat 
two Division I opponents
Tennis beats Robert Morris and Temple
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
After defeating Slippery 
Rock University two weeks ago 
to open the spring tennis sea­
son, the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
and women’s tennis teams took 
down Division I opponent Rob­
ert Morris University last Friday 
by scores of 7-0 and 6-1, respec­
tively. The men played again on 
Saturday, defeating Temple Uni­
versity 6-3.
Men’s team
On Friday, the men’s tennis 
team swept Robert Morris with 
every Tartan taking their chal­
lenger in straight sets. The loss 
moves the Colonials to 0-3 in 
dual competition.
The Tartans’ victory on Satur­
day against Temple, a Division I 
school, moves Carnegie Mellon 
to 7-1 in dual play and evens the 
Owls at 3-3. The Tartans are now 
ranked 14th in Division III.
“This was one of 
our biggest tests 
of the season 
and I’m glad we 
were able to pull 
it out.”
—Jon Spero
In the singles matches on 
Saturday, first-year Jon Spero de­
feated Pavlos Stephanides 6-1,
6-4 in the number-three singles. 
Junior Andrew Clearfield 6-3,
7-6 (5) and senior Jordan Ko- 
slosky (6-3, 6-0) also won their 
singles matches.
“We knew going in that [Tem­
ple] would be a hard match,” 
Spero said. “Temple plays in a 
competitive conference in Divi­
sion I so-of course they will have 
a very good team. This was one 
of our biggest tests of the season 
and I’m glad we were able to pull 
it out.”
“I think that this weekend... 
really set the tone for the spring 
semester, and provided great 
momentum for the tough sea­
son ahead,” Koslosky said. “I 
think that this weekend speaks 
volumes for the men’s tennis 
program. Being able to beat two 
Division I tennis teams in a single 
weekend is quite an accomplish­
ment for a Division III team.”
Koslosky and first-year Ravi 
Raghavan teamed up to defeat 
their opponents 9-7. Spero and 
first-year James Muliawan (8-5) 
and Clearfield and sophomore 
Yiran Lui (8-6) also won their 
doubles matches.
“The most critical thing in both 
of the matches was us sweeping 
all three of the doubles matches,” 
Koslosky said. “Finishing the 
doubles matches [and] being up 
3-0 gives all the singles players 
much more confidence and takes 
some of the pressure off. All of 
the singles players also raised 
their level of play to contribute to 
this successful weekend.”
The men’s tennis team is off 
from competition until Satur­
day, February 24 when they face 
Case Western Reserve University 
at 12:30 p.m. The matches will 
be held in the Pittsburgh Indoor 
Tennis Center.
Women’s team
With the win against Robert

more importantly, motivation.”
The only Carnegie Mellon loss 
came when Colonial player Hil­
ary Newman beat senior Mai 
Otsuka 7-6(1), 6-2 in the num- 
ber-five singles match.
“This week, we beat a Divi­
sion I team, which gave everyone 
on the team confidence that we 
can be at the top of Division III,” 
Staloch said.

join the men in Cleveland on Sat­
urday, February 24. The women’s

Clayton (2:32.43) and senior Jerri 
Castillo (2:33.50) finished eighth

Not much went right for 
the Tartans on Sunday against 
the Violets. The Tartans trailed 
the entire game and went into 
halftime down by 20 points.
The two teams played even 
basketball in the second half, but 
it was too little too late for the 
Tartans.
Carnegie Mellon trailed 8-0 
before sophomore center Rob 
Pearson’s basket got the Tartans 
on the board. The Tartans trailed 
42-22 at halftime arid .were un­
able to narrow the deficit to less 
than 16 points in the second half.
Einwag again led the Tartans 
with 12 points. Matta added nine 
points and nine rebounds in the 
loss. Kozak and sophomore guard 
Corey O’Rourke each had five as­
sists.
The Tartans shot 34.5 percent 
from the floor while NYU shot
43.5 percent. NYU had the edge in 
the rebound department as well, 
collecting 51 rebounds while the 
Tartans reeled in 35.
“I’ve said it before, but you 
can’t fall behind on the road in 
the UAA,” Matta said.
The Tartans will return home 
this weekend to play Washington 
University on Friday at 8 p.m.

Women’s basketball team falls to Brandéis and NYU
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
History repeated itself last 
weekend as the Carnegie Mel­
lon women’s basketball team 
dropped two games to Brandeis 
University and New York Univer­
sity — the Tartans lost to both 
teams over the first weekend of 
January.
Playing both games on the 
road, the Tartans fell short 
against Brandeis 74-48 and 
against NYU 86-66. The losses 
move Carnegie Mellon to 8-14 
overall and 2-9 in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA).
Brandeis began pulling away 
from the Tartans early in the 
game on Friday. The Judges built 
a 26-point lead (32-6) within 
the first 15 minutes of play. The 
Tartans and the Judges had simi­
lar shooting percentages (35 
percent), but turnovers allowed 
Brandeis to take 14 more shots 
during the first half. Brandeis was
up 37-17 heading into halftime.
“Once again, we just weren’t 
hitting our shots,” senior guard 
Nora Darcher said. “We were get­
ting some good looks, but we just 
weren’t hitting them.”
The Judges began the sec­
ond half strong — upping their 
field goal percentage to 54 per-
ing with 10 points. Sophomore 
forward Jeanette Schilling and 
sophomore guard Stacie Aleski 
each had nine points. Junior 
guard Leah Feola grabbed eight 
rebounds for the Tartans. First- 
year Jessica Chapin led Brandeis 
with a career-high 21 points and 
seven rebounds.

always rough because you are only home 
for three days between trips.”

cent. Carnegie Mellon reduced 
its point deficit to 12 points on 
two different occasions, but ul­
timately came up short against 
Brandeis. The win advances the 
Judges to 16-4 overall, and 6-4 
in the UAA.
Sophomore forward Ashley 
Rothwell led the Tartans in scor­
On Sunday, the Tartans played 
even with the Violets during the 
first half of the game. The Tar­
tans opened the game with a 6-0 
streak, making 48.5 percent of 
their shots throughout the" first 
half.
Leading by one (39-38) to start 
the second half, the Tartans were
unable to maintain their momen­
tum and NYU took control with
15 minutes left to play.
“We had such a strong first half 
against NYU, especially coming, 
off of Friday’s game,” Darcher 
said. “Things just didn’t go our 
way in the second half. We got 
some bad calls early in the second 
and the momentum shifted.”
Feola led the Tartans in the loss 
with 23 points and six rebounds. 
Rothwell added 12 points to the 
Tartan total.
The team will return home this 
weekend to play UAA opponents 
Washington University and Uni­
versity of Chicago on Friday and 
Sunday. Friday’s game begins at
6 p.m. while Sunday’s game is 
scheduled to begin at 2 p.m.
“Two back-to-back weekend 
trips are always rough because 
you are only home for three days 
between trips,” Darcher said. 
“I think that being back on our 
home court will be really help­
ful; we’ll be able to use it to our 
advantage.”
Tartan men’s basketball 
drops two away games
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team wrapped up its 
four-game road trip with games 
at Brandeis University on Friday 
and New York University on Sun­
day. The Tartans fell to Brandeis 
75-52 and lost 78-57 to the NYU 
Violets. The losses drop the Tar­
tans to 12-9 overall and 5-6 in 
the University Athletic Associa­
tion (UAA).
On Friday, The Tartans and 
Judges shared the lead through­
out the first half with Carnegie 
Mellon going up by four at 
29-25, on a three-pointer by ju­
nior guard Geoff Kozak off a pass 
from senior guard Brad Matta. 
Brandeis controlled the final 
4:31 of the first half, scoring 10 
straight points to lead 35-29 at 
halftime. Sophomore forward
Ryan Einwag led the Tartans 
with 10 first-half points.
In the second half, Einwag’s 
layup at the 16:17 mark cut the 
Judges’ lead to 40-38. The Tar­
tans couldn’t get over the hump 
and regain the lead, however, 
with Brandeis outscoring the 
Tartans 32-8 over the remain­
ing 14 minutes. A three-pointer 
by sophomore guard Elliott Cur­
tis at the buzzer capped off the 
scoring with Brandeis winning 
by 23.
Einwag led the Tartans with 12 
points and eight rebounds. Kozak 
and sophomore center Dan Mar­
tin each added eight points in 
the loss. The Tartans shot a mere
38.5 percent from the floor com­
pared to the Judges’ 50 percent. 
Carnegie Mellon also committed 
20 turnovers while the Judges 
had only nine miscues.

Tartan track travels to 
Bucknell for indoor meet
by Sam Kim
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon track 
and field teams competed in the 
Bucknell Winter Classic on Satur­
day. Both the men’s and women’s 
teams performed solidly, with 
highlights in the men’s 800-meter 
run and the women’s field events.
In the 800-meter run, the men’s 
team had four runners in the top 
12. Sophomore Brian Harvey led 
the team and finished second 
overall with a time of 1:58.30. 
Junior Drew Miller (1:59.95) and 
first-year Dan Burrows (2:03.02) 
finished seventh and ninth, 
respectively. Senior Kevin Pruz- 
insky finished 12th with a time of 
2:03.93.
After breaking a school record 
(4:18:05) in the mile run two 
weeks ago, Harvey took second 
in the mile on Saturday with a 
time of 4:13.80. Senior Geoff 
Misek finished fifth with a time of 
2:35.02.Harvey was scheduled to 
run the distance medley relay, but 
a late arrival to the meet forced 
him to do the mile run.
“After our bus broke down on 
the highway on the way to the 
meet, we were stranded at a gas 
station for two hours,” Harvey 
said. “If our bus wouldn’t have 
broken down, I wouldn’t have run 
the mile today and run a provi­
sional national qualifying time.”
In the 400-meter dash, senior 
Russel Verbofsky finished sixth
with a time of 52.74. Sophomore 
Stephano Dubuc finished in sev­
enth place with a time of 53.07. 
Verbofsky (23.36) and first-year 
Chris Bogie (23.74) placed 12th 
and 16th in the 200-meter dash, 
respectively. Sophomore Craig 
Hahn finished 14th in the 500- 
meter dash with a time of 1:12.83. 
Senior Nicholas Bannister (7.81) 
and Hahn (8.47) finished fifth and 
13th, respectively, in the 55-meter 
hurdles.
Senior Eric Tang jumped 13.05 
meters in the triple jump to come 
in fifth place. Behind Tang, 
sophomores Colin Marks (12.72 
meters) and Joel Palko (12.45 
meters) finished eighth and 11th, 
respectively.
First-year James Hulley threw 
for 14.01 meters in the shot put 
to finish in fourth place. Junior 
Michael Edge placed sixth in the 
weight throw with a 14.62-meter 
throw. The men’s 4x400-meter 
relay team finished fifth with a 
time of 3:32.52.
On the women’s side, first-year 
Timi Abimbola came in 13th in 
the 60-meter dash with a time 
of 8.70. Sophomore Jackie An- 
dreozzi (27.86) finished 13th in 
the 200-meter dash while junior 
Shauna Ormon (1:02.60) came in 
13th for the 400-meter dash.
In the 500-meter run, first-

Last week, the Carnegie Mel­
lon swim team competed at 
the University Athletic Asso­
ciation championships, held at 
Case Western Reserve Univer­
sity. The men’s team took third 
place, along with numerous 
personal recognitions. Now, the 
swimmers are preparing for na­
tionals, to be held in Houston at 
the end of March.
A few days before the cham­
pionships, The Tartan chatted
with David Krzeminski, a senior 
swimmer. Over the weekend, 
Krzeminski received the title 
of Men’s Swimmer of the Year. 
He also won individual titles in 
the 100- and 200-yard butterfly 
events.
Tartan: So, the team just 
went on a trip to Florida over 
winter break? How’d that go?
Krzeminski: It’s probably 
the most important training we 
do all year. [Our coach’s phi­
losophy is:] You can stay here in 
Pittsburgh where it’s cold and 
snowy, or [you can] go down to 
Florida —- try to enjoy yourself 
at least a little bit.
T: So Florida pretty much 
takes the edge off?
K: Yeah, pretty much. It’s 
more of a morale thing than 
anything else.... Not a lot of kids 
get a chance to travel, so you get 
a chance to see Miami.
T: How many hours would 
you swim a day?
K: Swimming-wise, two
two-hour practices. We’re shar­
ing the pool down there with 
other teams. We swam in the 
pool with teams like Columbia, 
NYU.
T: How’s the season going?
K: Very well. Both teams 
only lost one dual meet. Our 
conference meet is actually this 
weekend. In terms of where
we’re seated and how people 
should be doing, we should fin­
ish up the season very well.
After that, the national meet 
is a month later. That’s sort of 
where you get a chance to prove 
who you are to teams you don’t 
see at all during the year.
The national meet is sort of 
the apex of the season I guess, 
for some people. Not everyone 
on the team will make nation­
als.
T: How many years have you 
gone to nationals?
K: Personally, I’ve gone all 
three years. If things go well 
this year, I’ll get four-for-four.
T: When did you first get in­
volved with swimming?
K: Competitively, I started 
when I was five. The reason­
ing was I was tired of going to 
my sister’s swim meets, sitting 
in the stands, so I just decided, 
“Why not try it out?” So, I’ve 
been swimming competitively 
since then.
T: Did you always know you 
were going to swim in college?
K: No, I played football and 
did baseball in high school as 
well. I was kind of looking at 
the combination of the school 
academically and athletically; 
[Carnegie Mellon] had a phe­
nomenal swim program and 
academics.
Plus, swimming is sort of a
lifelong sport; a lot of people 
play football — it’s very easy to 
get injured. Putting the school 
aside, I’d probably still pick 
swimming. It’s probably one of 
those inner passions — I guess 
you could call it that.
¦T: How do balance every­
thing? Swim meets, school 
work.
K: Well, there are many times 
when things like sleep and eat­
ing meals take the backseat. 
Luckily I’ve never had to pull a 
true all-nighter at this school;
I know other student athletes 
that have.
While you’re in a sport, it 
forces you to manage your time. 
You have to be very organized, 
very disciplined.
Basically, you just eat, sleep, 
swim.
T: Do you think we need a 
mascot?
K: I think we should stick 
with the Scottish.theme; that’s 
kind of how we identify our­
selves as a university. If we were 
to pick some random animal 
that didn’t really identify with 
Carnegie Mellon’s tradition and 
history, it’d be a little hard to 
rally around that.
There’s hundreds of schools 
named the bulldogs or the wild­
cats, but I think it’s kind of neat 
when you come across a school 
that’s mascot needs a little bit of 
explaining along with it.

What do you think?
Savory male and female perspectives
Everything you need to know
About finding someone, and finding someone else
Carrie Bradshaw, antiheroine
Sanyu: Sex and the City marginalizes women into 
two categories: those who have sex "like men" and 
those who don’t. In addition, the show’s narrator 
and driving force may write better than most, but 
aside from a shoe collection that could dress the 
entire city, she has little success in her relationships 
and often proves the cause of most of her dating 
problems. Carrie Bradshaw is skinny and cute at 
best, but she allows her fear of commitment to rule 
her love life and compromises her "strong woman” 
convictions to please an often unappreciative, 
unfocused Mr. Big. In spite of these damning flaws, 
Sex and the City has become more than a well- 
written HBO series and some women even swear by 
more'than Carrie's fashion sense.
Many women, even those as distrusting and - ¦ 
defensive as Carrie, prefer a medium between sex 
and love. Not all of us glamorize the idea of having 
a Mr. Big, especially at a time when boundless 
freedom and raging hormones run rampant in an 
unsupervised environment.
Justin: I’ve never seen a full episode of Sex and the 
City. Sarah Jessica Parker is totally not attractive, 
girls are twisted, and girls in groups who talk are 
scary as hell. Also, girls who watch TV and movies 
and go “I want that” need to wake up and smell the 
inherent corruption in people and screenwriters.
The Vogue quandary
S: Print media and television upholds an unhealthy 
standard of beauty that leads many young women 
on an exhausting and demoralizing wild goose chase 
towards an unrealistic ideal. The increasing visibility 
of stringy supermodels suggests that a woman has 
to embody a warped version of perfection in order to 
feel beautiful. In reality, physical appearance plays 
a large role in attractiveness, but it is imperative 
to note that the scale of attractiveness differs from 
person to person, and personality defines a person 
much more than looks do.
J: Cosmo and company are seriously destroying 
society. No girl or woman will ever look as "perfect”
as an airbrushed, Photoshop-breast-enhanced 
image that adorns magazines and billboards and 
advertisements that are forced into our visual 
experience every day. Just be comfortable with 
yourself. That's a LOT more attractive than being 
dead.
Getting physical
S: The myth that says girls move slower than guys 
is uninformed and generalized. I cannot speak for 
the entire.female population, but an increasing 
amount of young women are embracing their sexual 
freedoms when they enter college. The decision 
to advance sexually with a partner depends upon 
intentions, so if a girl does not seek a long-lasting 
relationship with a guy, she may be more likely to 
advance at a faster pace.
J: Yeah, some girls need to settle down a little bit. I 
cannot believe I’m saying that as a guy. Girls at this 
age are just growing into their mature selves and 
becoming comfortable with it. As guys are coming 
down off the “ohmigosh need sex now!” hormone 
kick, girls are just starting up a similar path.
Communication
S: No relationship can sustain itself without 
communication between both members, so the best 
way to ensure a lasting relationship is to remain 
clear as to where the relationship is going. On 
average, girls talk more than twice as much as guys 
do and this can cause problems in a relationship, 
so both members must actively communicate their 
feelings with one another even if articulating may 
not always be easy.
J: Talking is hard, especially when it’s actually 
about something important and at-hand. Guys will- 
drag their feet a little bit — don't let this stop you 
from (patiently) pushing. Most will come around 
eventually. YELLING DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING.

Step 1: Cut a hole in the box. 
Step 2: Bid on a date?
Dear Janet,
I think I might be too picky 
when it comes to dating. 
There aren’t a lot of gay guys 
on campus that I really like, for 
various reasons. Sometimes I 
think it’s better to just be alone 
than to settle for someone, but 
what if my expectations are 
too high?
-Seeing No One Better 
Dear SNOB,
If you’re searching for a 
relationship, I don’t think there’s 
any reason to waste your time 
with someone you’re just not 
feeling a connection with. It’s hard 
enough'to find somebody, worth 
dating, and when you factor in 
your orientation and your personal 
tastes, and the fact that we’re 
in Pittsburgh, the dating pool 
shrinks far more. Are you looking 
exclusively at Carnegie Mellon? 
There’s a whole city of hot boys out 
there just waiting to meet a smart, 
sexy stud-muffin like yourself. 
I’d also suggest looking around 
online — you may be surprised at 
how much more open people can 
be about their preferences on the 
Internet. You should really only be 
worried about having standards 
too high if you’ve been in the real 
world for a while and you still can’t 
find anyone you like.
-Janet
Did you know?
Dear Janet,
Help! My ex-girlfriend lives just 
down the hall from me, and 
though we’re still good friends, 
I have a big problem. I brought 
someone else home the other 
night, and it was incredibly 
awkward. I don’t want to make 
my ex-girlfriend feel bad, but I 
need to move on!
-Seeking To Attract Girls
Dear STAG,
That’s an unfortunate situation. 
However, it’s really good that 
you and your ex have managed 
to remain friends — that’s an 
accomplishment in and of itself. 
If you’re sure that there’s nothing 
between you anymore (and you 
should really try to figure that 
out), then there’s no reason you 
shouldn’t go on living your life. 
That doesn’t mean rubbing it in 
her face, though. Especially if it’s 
a one-night-only type of situation, 
there’s no reason you can't stay 
in your room instead of hanging 
out in common areas. And, as 
always, turn on a stereo while 
you’re doing it. Trust me, nobody 
ever wants to hear that, and the 
walls are always thinner than you 
think they are.
-Janet

‘Faking it’—the things we do for love
When it comes to attracting a partner, it's not what you say—it’s how
We’ve all done it — faked admiration for a movie we 
haven’t seen, a book we haven’t read, an actor we’ve 
never even heard of. It's not hard to envision: The girl who 
grits her teeth and goes to Nascar races to get closer to 
her crush, the guy who suffers through the opera to win 
over his beloved, or the online chatter frantically googling 
a band mid-conversation in order to impress that special 
someone with a knowledge of its lyrics. If you're seeing 
yourself in any of these, that’s okay.
The tendency to “fake it” is a common human urge, not 
only present in human courtship, but a constant factor in 
our daily interactions. We are perpetually aware of how 
we present ourselves to the world — seeking to adjust 
that persona according to what w6 believe people want 
from us. According to Kathleen McGowan of Psychology 
Today, we spend up to three hours a day managing our 
self-presentations. The need to shape this persona into 
a pleasing form is intensified when we are romantically 
attracted to another person. In order to gain his or her 
approval, we modify our behavior in ways we couldn’t 
have imagined beforehand.
“People like those who are similar to them — on 
almost any characteristic, including attitudes, values, 
demographics, physical attractiveness, and behavior,” 
wrote Brooke Feeney, a professor in the psychology 
department, in an e-mail.
Feeney’s research interests lie in how intimacy functions 
in relationships and how relationships help us cope with 
stress. "It's true that 'birds of a feather flock together.' And
it’s not true that 'opposites attract,' ” she said. This may 
contradict what many people believe about compatibility, 
though it makes sense in the context of a typical first date. 
Here, commonalities are hunted for like prize trophies, and 
discrepancies in interest or taste are quickly smoothed 
over.
However, according to Feeney, we have a considerably 
greater effect on the course of interpersonal relations than 
what we might expect. Less important than “faking it,” or 
presenting ourselves in a certain way, is how we behave 
toward a person. Feeney said. “If you expect someone with 
whom you interact to be an attractive person, then you will 
behave towards him or her in ways that bring out those 
attractive qualities.”
The converse is true as well. “But if you expect the 
opposite, you will probably constrain the interaction 
partner to show those positive attributes, or you might 
even bring out negative attributes,” Feeny said, “So, we do 
tend to reap what we sow."
With this in mind, perhaps we have less to worry about 
on dates than we think. The success of an interaction 
does not depend totally upon how we appear to a person 
in terms of our interests and personality, but on our 
general attitude toward that person and the experience of 
spending time with him or her.
"Faking" aspects of our personality upon first meeting 
someone we're interested in is probably wise, Feeney 
added, saying that "first impressions have tremendous
staying power.” In the early stages of relationship 
development, it’s an important step to make a favorable 
impression so that you remain in someone’s mind.
However, the tendency to be on one’s best behavior
— or at least one’s most charismatic — lessens with 
time. "Research shows that we usually go to less trouble 
to maintain favorable images for our intimate partners 
than we do for others," Feeney said. "Although people 
behave charmingly to win the love of a romantic partner, 
many never work at being so charming to that person 
ever again." On the contrary, she added, “[As soon as] 
a relationship develops, people often put forth effort to 
create desired images of their partners."
We all know that love is a tricky business. The process 
of gaining and maintaining it leads us to desperate 
lengths of deception, or short-term "faking.." But in the 
long run, the personalities that people present are not far 
from the truth. Ultimately, lying isn’t necessary, Feeney 
explained, "because partners tend to idealize each other 
anyways." However it happens, relationships usually 
wind up based on what's real. “There generally isn’t gross 
misrepresentation in real face-to-face encounters that 
evolve[s] into real relationships," she said. "This would be 
very difficult to do in practice."

The last adult film house in Pittsburgh
The historic Garden Theatre may have to leave the North SidePaperhouse
On sex music
Since the shift away from steel production, the city 
of Pittsburgh has been undergoing a makeover to 
improve its economic and cultural standing. Where 
steel mills and towering brick chimneys once dotted the 
landscape, visitors now find run-down buildings and 
vacant streets and lots. To revamp Pittsburgh’s image 
and put it back on the map, the city is encouraging 
accelerated economic growth and a new, sleek look 
for the growing downtown area. But what about the 
porn? Where does the evgt-present industry of adult 
entertainment fit into this new picture?
The Garden Theatre, Pittsburgh's last remaining adult 
film theater (read: house of porn), is located in the 
North Side on the Federal-North corridor, along Federal 
Street between North Avenue and Sampsonia Street. 
Just steps away from Heinz Field and PNC Park, the 
corridor is an important three-block stretch of land.
The area, if cleared, would provide ample space for 
offices, apartments, and retail stores. It’s what both 
the city and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of- 
Pittsburgh (URA) are working toward: to push crime out 
of the North Side, revitalize the area, and draw in both 
crowds and revenue. That's why, since 1997, the city 
has been fighting to take the property away from owner 
George Androtsakis through eminent domain (when a 
government sector takes ownership of private property).
“We don’t really care about the Garden at this point," 
State Senator Jim Ferlo (D-Allegheny County) told The 
Philadelphia Inquirer in January. “We're not going to sit 
around any longer and wait for that issue. We need to 
get moving.”
That is, the officials of the city of Pittsburgh are intent 
on improving the economic situation of the city's 
boroughs at any cost, even if it means removing 
pornography — yes, even pornography — from the 
landscape.
Peter Georgiades, Androtsakis' lawyer from 1997 to 
2004, stated that the Garden Theatre movie house
has drawn in 50,000 patrons a year, as reported in the 
Pittsburgh Business Times. Moreover, as Georgiades 
told The Philadelphia Inquirer, “People will travel from 
the next county to go to an adult theater.... But people 
don’t go through nasty neighborhoods with abandoned 
buildings to see Lethal Weapon 2." In other words, if 
there’s going to be an adult movie theater in Pittsburgh, 
it should be in the North Side.
Pittsburgh is left with a difficult decision: celebrate 
the Garden Theater and search for the potential of its 
surrounding neighborhood, or side with the URA and 
hope for change. Is economic development worth the 
loss of a long-celebrated movie house and historical 
landmark?
On the one hand, renovating the neighborhood would 
draw more people to the downtown area — to work 
in converted office spaces, to live in new apartments, 
and to shop in retail stores, all of which would draw 
in large amounts of revenue. Economic growth of this 
measure would clearly be beneficial to Pittsburgh. Still, 
losing the last adult film theater is like losing some 
of Pittsburgh’s down-home flavor: Who says ancient 
buildings — boarded-up windows and all — don’t add 
at least a smidgen of character to a college'town? The 
Garden was built in 1915 as a film theater and switched 
to showing pornography in 1972. It’s been a part of the 
North Side for over 90 years.
Androtsakis' argument is that the city has no right to 
take his property before even hiring a developer — he’s 
refused the $250,000 offered to him under eminent 
domain. Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, however, is moving 
forward with the development of the area, recently 
requesting a proposal to develop eight buildings and 
two currently vacant lots near the theater. As quoted in 
The Philadelphia Inquirer, Ravenstahl said, "I’ve taken 
the mindset,-'Let's get it done.”’

90 years, the GardenTheateremay 
soon be closed down in favor of 
economic development.
Music can tantalize the aural senses, arouse the physical body, and 
complement the fine art of copulation. So for people who can’t stand 
Marvin Gaye and are tired of infomercials for Girls Gone Wild in the 
background while you’re trying to “get your bone on,” here’s a short 
stack of new choices provided by the DJs of WRCT.
Goth/Industrial: Here we have an expansive selection of choices 
depending on what kind of emotion you want to express, as long as 
it’s angry or sad. Depeche Mode’s “A Question Of Lust” or “Never Let 
Me Down Again” are tried and true slow romantic songs that set the 
mood and allow for some sensual writhing. Then, to pick up the pace 
and really get rough, try some aggrotech like Combichrist’s “You Will 
Be The Bitch Now” or “Enjoy The Abuse” — you’ll definitely show 
your partner who’s the boss. For those not interested in reaming but 
still wanting to make an impact, “Closer” by Nine Inch Nails is an 
absolute foolproof solution. Following the climax, we suggest either 
Wolfsheim’s “Lovesong” (for cuddles) or “I Don’t Love You Anymore” 
(to kick them out of your bed).
Metal: Most metal songs aren’t really designed to enhance your 
sexing. If they’re mentioning sex at all, it’s usually along the lines 
of W.A.S.P.’s “Animal (Fuck Like a Beast)” or Cannibal Corpse’s 
"Orgasm Through Torture" — not exactly the thing that most 
people would pick for getting it on. However, if you’re looking for 
background music, there are always bands like — in increasingly 
ambient order — My Dying Bride, Isis, Angel Eyes, Harvey Milk, 
Corrupted, or Sunn O))), which will at least not actively impair your 
mood-setting attempts. On the other hand, if your preferred manner 
of getting it on involves breaking furniture and possible contusions, 
it’s hard to go wrong with Motorhead or Dragonforce.
Electronic: If you don’t mind long, slow sex, there’s always “Fuck” 
by the Hafler Trio, which clocks in at nearly a half-hour of strange 
samples and typical creepy ambient atmosphere. If you like a little 
less subtlety, there’s Nymphomatriarch by Hecate and Venetian 
Snares, featuring song titles like “Blood on the Rope" and “Hymen 
Tramp Choir,” which is an album made entirely out of samples 
recorded via contact mikes'of the two artists having sex in a hotel 
room. If .you like things even less subtle than that, do it near a TV and 
put on the video for “Windowlicker” by Aphex Twin, or “flex” by Chris 
Cunningham.

Breaking up is hard enough
How to handle a V-Day split (with style and grace)
Valentine's Day is not without a sense of irony. Although 
it's the holiday for lovers, it also seems to coincide with an 
epidemic of breakups and lovers' spats. I have no scientific 
evidence behind this whatsoever; it's just something I’ve 
noticed.
Perhaps we realize that we’re no longer like all those 
annoyingly happy couples that are suddenly everywhere. 
Maybe February provokes relationship Darwinism: The 
constant cover of clouds and frigid temperatures are so 
depressing that only the strongest, healthiest bonds survive 
the month. Regardless of why so many relationships hit 
the skids, if yours weathers the rigors of February, you can 
probably breathe a sigh of relief until the next potential 
calamity comes along (e.g. someone’s birthday or an 
anniversary).
Sadly, we can't all be so lucky. If you're one of the unfortunate 
sweethearts-turned-sour planning to end your relationship 
this week, the following are some pointers to help get you 
through with your dignity (and life).
Make sure you mean it: You can’t go stampeding into a 
breakup. Think this through — or risk disaster. Are you sure 
want to do this? Are you ready for everyone to give you the 
“So close to V-Day?” interrogation? Can you hold off until 
March? The only reason to hurry things up is if you’ve started 
to throw sharp objects at each other.
Don’t try to scare them away by demanding 
really freaky sex stuff: You never know what 
someone might agree to.
Do all the necessary prep work: Start retrieving 
your DVDs and clothing from your significant other's 
place. Backpacks or baggy pants come in handy here.
You might also want to remove any knives, throwing stars, 
or books with sharp edges. If you've got a television or 
something valuable over there, unplug it and act incredulous 
that it won’t work. Insist on taking it in for service to get it 
out of there. You’ll thank me when your last memory of your 
television is not the sight of it being thrown out a window.
Trust no one: You have no friends come breakup time. If you 
even breathe a word of your plans to any human being, it will 
find a way to your lover. Gossip is not to be trifled with. It not 
only defies physics by moving faster than light, but also defies 
thermodynamics by constantly increasing in energy. Don't 
even share your plans with a guy in a coma; he might wake 
up and ruin everything.
Carefully choose your medium: I have to insist that 
you be a man (or woman) about this. No phone calls, text 
messages, IMs, or e-mails. Do it in person. If it must be 
impersonal, a singing telegram adds a nice touch of class. 
Also, you could attach a letter to a puppy — who could stay 
mad at a puppy?
Sex with an ex?
One of the great taboos in relationship theory
Hooking up with an ex: It's undeniably one of the great eternal 
debates relating to life, love, and the human libido. We all 
know of the stigma associated with “hooking up" with your 
ex, but plenty do it anyway. Some argue that it leads to pain 
and suffering, while others insist that it’s only a harmless 
diversion. Either way, what does it really mean to “hook up"? 
And when, if ever, is it healthy to get involved with an ex?
“It's tough enough to stay as friends after a breakup. It's 
not worth it to jeopardize a good thing on something like a 
hookup," said André Tartar, an H&SS sophomore majoring 
in economics and creative writing. After being so close to 
another person, a breakup usually places a divide between 
two people; conversations that were once filled with personal 
tidbits transform into mere formalities — embraces turn into 
awkward “ass-out hugs" (straight out of Wedding Crashers).
This problem is especially prominent for first-years. Whether 
high school relationships end abruptly or drag on, there’s 
rarely a chance to figure things out before going off to college. 
The result? A double life where having sex with an ex from 
home is acceptable as long as the distance keeps the two 
worlds, school and home, apart. But such distinction is hard 
to maintain. For those who want to separate the ex from the 
sex, it's probably better to make things clear; draw the line 
and keep things uncomplicated by never stepping over it. 
That is, if you want to separate them. For some, hooking up 
with an ex creates an ideal relationship: being intimate with 
someone you know and trust can provide the perfect mix of 
pleasure and security. You’re not treading on any new ground; 
you know what to expect, and you like that. At the same time,
be sure to remember that this is your ex; there’s a reason the 
relationship didn't work out the first time around. It takes a 
certain amount of control to judge a hookup as something 
purely physical and nothing more. To begin investing in the 
relationship can transform the ex into a potential love interest, 
and the results can be heartbreaking. Cue the vicious cycle.
The issue is compounded when we look at hooking up while 
dating another person. If the ex wasn’t worth dating and 
this new love interest is, then why keep the ex on speed 
dial? “When you break up with someone, you’re trying to 
take a step forward and move on in life. To me, going back 
into the arms of another guy is just taking 20 steps in the 
wrong direction,” said Deena Zytnick, a senior majoring in 
psychology. "Being 'friends with benefits' just doesn’t seem 
possible with an ex,” Zytnick said. "There's a history you 
share, and with it an emotional attachment. You can’t have a 
fling when you've invested so much into it before.”
Still, it’s not always so simple. After all, plenty of relationships 
end without someone feeling wronged and needing to move 
forward. What if it 'ended in misunderstanding? "I suppose 
having sex with an ex is a great catalyst for reviving the 
relationshipZytnick said, "but who really knows what they 
want?” Let's not forget, this is college; emotions, the whole 
coming-of-age craziness, and the carpe diem of youth can 
make some bad options more appealing than they should be. 
Probably the worst excuse for poor decisions is alcohol. A 
few rounds will help knock down some reservations, but the 
underlying feeling had to exist in the first place. We’re quick 
to call it a lapse in judgment, but we never bother to consider
Zhiquan Yeo | Photo Staff
Don't start with 
“We have to talk”: No
conversation in human 
history beginning with "we ' 
have to talk” has ever ended well. 
Because everyone knows what "we 
have to talk" means, the mood will 
already be sour. Avoid those doldrums 
with an original, zesty scheme to initiate the 
breakup. Perhaps "I have a surprise for you..."; "A 
good metaphor for our relationship is The Titanic for 
the following reasons...”; or “Webster’s Dictionary defines 
'breakup' as....”
Be respectful and firm: There’s no need to start with the 
insults. Those come later, when you’re drunk. And don’t let 
them change your mind! If you lose this argument, you forever 
mark yourself as a vacillating wuss. Stick to your guns!
No, you may not have one last beastly rendezvous for 
old times’ sake: Don’t even ask.
Lee Reamsnyder | Staffwriter
the “hookup" as some sort of unconscious want, allowing a 
few beers to break the ice. It might very well be your inner self 
paging you, “I think you might still like the person.”
What if there’s really no interest in getting back together with 
the ex? Many believe it’s acceptable when you’re desperate 
for sex, when you really don’t care for that person anymore in 
any shape or form. If that's the case, it can be an ex, but never 
someone you see as a friend. With friendship comes subtext, 
creating the potential for misunderstandings. If you’re going 
to go for a “no strings attached" mentality, make sure that 
your intentions are clear.
Maybe it’s the chemicals released during sex, or maybe it's 
the symbolic meaning of it, but having sex with an ex rarely 
ends with just sex. An attachment or expectation is likely 
to form, and you’re left with mixed emotions. Inevitably, the 
scale has to tip one way or the other, based on how bad the 
breakup was, how you feel about each other, and where the 
relationship is intended to go. After all, you can only keep 
moving to a new city so many times; at some point, it might 
be good to figure out what you really want from a friend, an 
ex, and yourself. It's probably best you do that kind of thinking 
out of bed.

The first date survival guide
From hair gel to Killer Cookies: ‘How to,’ ‘how not to,’ and ‘How do you do?’
Valentine's Day is coming up — it’s the one time of year when 
it’s possible to get away with going up to a crush in calculus 
(or in my case, world history) and asking him or her out on 
a date. It all seems fine and dandy when your date-to-be 
says "yes,” but panic takes hold once you are sitting in your 
dorm room, preparing for that first rendez-vous. This first 
date survival guide will get you home (or into someone else's 
home) in one piece.
What to wear?
Now for girls, this one is easy. New trends make it casual 
and cool to wear dresses over spandex or dresses over jeans. 
Basically, keep your outfit fresh and comfortable. If you're 
not the type of girl who wears miniskirts,- don’t try it on a 
first date or you’ll spend the night tugging and fussing to 
make sure all of your lower half is covered. If you’re going 
somewhere casual — to coffee, for example, or (sigh) Schatz
— make sure your clothing is neat and flattering. I know it’s 
minus 50° outside; it’s okay to resort to a cute pea coat over 
an XXL Tartan hoodie.
For guys, don’t be afraid to look nice. You won’t seem 
desperate, we promise. Give the constellation T-shirt the 
night off and opt for something that buttons down. I’m 
going to recommend Ralph Lauren or Lacoste, but that’s just 
because I’m from Connecticut. A dark-wash pair of jeans is 
definitely "in style," but khakis will do fine as well. For shoes, 
sneakers are acceptable unless they are full of holes. Timbs 
or some nice leather are favorable; they will tie the ensemble 
together.
Hygiene
Brushed teeth are a must. A MUST! "I once kissed a guy who 
had the most terrible breath," said Hannah Pileggi, a first-year 
in CIT. "It was a major turn-off. I’ve avoided him ever since."
Bring breath mints, particularly if you’re eating a meal. For 
girls, makeup should be subtle. Guys can usually see right 
through the whole heavy eyeliner and bronzer routine, so keep 
it natural. For some guys, hair gel can work. Those trying to 
emulate the Brad Pitt/Vanilla Ice hair should probably stay 
away from the goop on a first date, when you are likely to go 
overboard due to nerves.
Places to go
Generally, first dates should be coffee, second dates lunch, 
third-plus dates dinner — but those are just suggestions. You 
can also try other cute activities (particularly for Valentine’s 
Day), such as ice-skating at Schenley Park or taking a break 
from the cold at the indoor garden at Phipps Conservatory.
If you’re up for a romantic dinner, try Girasole on Walnut 
Street. For the more frugal, you can always use DineXtra arid 
grab a Killer Cookie at the Underground — they’re half-off on 
Valentine’s Day. As for paying for your date, girls definitely 
appreciate a guy who forks over the cash. Chivalry is always 
good, but don’t think it’s going to get you any more than good 
conversation.
Conversation dos and don'ts
Let’s take into consideration that not every first date scenario 
is going to be the same. Conversation topics really depend 
upon how well you know the person. On a first date, though, 
you’re usually starting from scratch. So, you’ve gazed at 
this guy or girl across lecture for several months, and you've 
finally worked up the courage to ask him or her out. Relax
— the hardest part is already over. Make sure you keep 
the conversation light; don’t talk too much about yourself, 
but don’t interview your date either. You’re just scratching 
the surface. Save the heavy-duty questions for the next 
date. Above all, you want to give your date a sense of your 
personality, so act like you’re talking to a friend with whom
you’re comfortable — not a potential one-night stand. Don’t- 
go-theres: past relationships, politics, religion, your personal 
theories on life, the weather (we all know it's cold), and "When 
I was wasted" or "How I got tested for STDs last weekend..." 
stories.
The escape plan
So this person you were eyeing in statistics turns out to be a 
real, uh, outlier. How do you escape? "To get out of a bad date, 
I would act really tired,” said Jordan Rosenfeld, a first-year in 
H&SS. “Or I would say I'm getting really sick.”
Relying on a friend may also be a good option. “If the date's 
going south, I text a friend to call me and pretend she needs 
me, urgently," Pileggi said. “Works every time."
To kiss or not to kiss — that is the question
Hopefully, instead of an escape, by the end of the date you’ll 
be looking for a way in. The decision to go in for the kiss is a 
personal one. But if you don't get any action the first night, it 
doesn’t always mean that your date isn’t interested. It's really 
just a personal preference. However, if multiple “dates” pass 
by and nothing happens, you can count on this person as a 
new, really good... friend.
This is a lot to take in, but just remember: First dates are 
ultimately supposed to be about having fun. Cut out this 
article, tape it to your leg, and take a chance this Valentine’s 
Day!

Let Barnes & Noble save your love life
A book doesn’t have to be Lolita to talk about sex
When shopping for literature concerning sex and the dating 
scene, sometimes the books tend to pass it off as a gag. But 
if you’re going to be walking up to the counter with The 
Hookup Handbook: A Single Girl's Guide to Living it Up, then 
you better grow at least a small set of cajones.
Sex help books, dating etiquette manuals, and even worst- 
case scenario survival guides for scary date situations are only 
a sampling of what’s available in your local Barnes and Noble. 
In the "Relationships” section, you can find books ranging 
from heart-felt guides to saving your marriage to, well, The 
Hookup Handbook. “Sexuality” generally offers sex position 
guides — in general the racier material.
Even the most mundane and minuscule bookstore has a few 
titles worth buying, or at least worth bargaining for at your 
local Goodwill. Here’s a guide to a few of the best.
The Cosmo Sutra, from the editors of Cosmopolitan
The Cosmo Sutra is a fun red book that actually comes pre­
wrapped throughout the weeks preceding Valentine’s Day, in 
case you want to give it as a gift. The Cosmo Sutra is great for 
candle arrangements and the like, but there isn't much in the 
way of excitement in the sexual positions department. -
After all, that's what sutras of any type should be about: 
exposing you to new ways of doing the nasty. And while some 
of what's inside The Cosmo Sutra looks like a lot of fun (and 
some just plain funny), most of it is old news — the editors of 
Cosmo might have had better luck talking about another area 
of the carnal department: foreplay.
This isn't just a girl thing. Sex is a careful balancing act 
that requires foreplay in different amounts: to create the 
right mood, the right feelings, and even the right length of 
interaction (no pun intended). Of course, checking out the 
pages of an actual Cosmo will surely give you tons of advice 
on foreplay techniques; maybe the editors just assumed its 
readers were already informed and ready for the nasty.
What would really be appreciated in a translation of the Kama 
Sutra would be some worthy advice on how each position 
will affect the performance and comfort of those involved. Not 
just the amount of flexibility, but (bomb drop) the likelihood 
that the guy is going to take longer or less time to orgasm, 
whether the position is suited to speedy sex or slow, or how 
much this position is likely to plain tire you out.
The Game by Neil Strauss
This book's packaging does a lot to make it look like the Bible: 
a big black cover, shiny gold edges, and a red inside cover.
The dedication reads: "Dedicated to the thousands of people 
I talked to in bars, clubs, malls, airports, grocery stores, 
subways, and elevators over the last two years. If you are 
reading this, I want you to know that I wasn’t running game 
on you. I was being sincere. Really. You were different.”
The premise: Strauss finds an online society of men trading 
tips on how to pick up women. One of the gurus of this site 
is offering pick-up lessons. Intrigued, Strauss becomes one of 
the students in a workshop dedicated to getting some action. 
From there, Strauss goes on a wild ride — learning all the
tricks of picking up chicks. The first girl that Strauss’ new 
mentor, Mystery, uses to demonstrate his ability to “number- 
close” (a term the characters use for getting a girl's number) is 
Scott Baio's girlfriend. Really.
The book kind of makes you feel slimy, but it’s wildly 
engaging, funny, and mystifying. Following along as Strauss 
goes from a student in Mystery’s workshop to Mystery's 
. right-hand man is great reading. The Game contains ideas 
for pick-up lines and tricks to keep a girl talking once you've 
made your opener. However, these tips are often buried in the 
book-length text — a little hard to pick out.
The most simple tip found in The Game is to bring a piece 
of lint, place it on a girl’s shirt, and then ask her, "Hey how 
long has that lint been there?” Still, there are also complicated 
routines, magic tricks, and other techniques, which — 
according to Mystery — are the key to getting yourself laid.
For those just looking for pick-up line tips: You will have to 
wade through quite a lot of text to get there. But that text is 
very, very interesting. This book might even be a good read 
for any girl who wants to know when a guy is running his 
game on her.

Terminator 2: 
Judgment Day
Wednesday, February 14
7 10 1
Arnold Schwarzenegger has 
big, sexy arms. In Terminator
2, those big, sexy arms end up 
hugging a young John Connor 
as the robot (formerly a killer) 
learns the true meaning of 
friendship and humanity. While 
Schwarzenegger and Connor try 
to avert a nuclear judgment day 
and the fall of humanity, a robot 
from the future is stalking them. 
A robot from the future who can 
shift shapes and make his arms 
into swords. Nothing says sexy 
like a shapeshifting, killer sword 
robot. Maybe he’ll bring you a 
rose. A rose that he cut with his 
sword-arms.
Invisible Waves

Slow pace. Mystery. Discovery. 
Thailand. What better way to 
spend your day-late Valentine’s 
Day date than whispering sweet 
nothings as the main character 
Kyoji slowly uncovers who he 
can trust and who is trying to kill 
him. But be careful: The movie 
begins with Kyoji accidentally 
killing his girlfriend, which 
might make you look bad. On 
the other hand, she might be 
impressed: “Hey, at least you 
haven’t accidentally killed me 
yet!”
The Departed
Friday, February 16
7 10 1
Down some Guinness and don 
some green: Martin Scorsese is 
taking us to Boston! Hardcore 
Irish Boston, of course, where 
the women are pale and the 
barfights are regular. That’s 
not entirely true, I suppose; it’s 
modern-day South Boston, 
after all, and it’s overrun by 
organized crime. Matt Damon 
and Leonardo DiCaprio play two 
men on opposite sides of the 
fight — Damon is a cop feeding 
info to Jack Nicholson, the mob 
leader in Boston, and DiCaprio 
is an undercover cop trying to 
destroy Nicholson’s group from 
the inside out. Sexy Irish men, a 
star-studded ensemble (Martin 
Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark 
Wahlberg, among others), and a 
smokin’ hot police psychologist 
to boot? Sign me up.
Stranger Than 
Fiction
Saturday, February 17
8 10 12
Will Ferrell takes himself slightly 
more seriously in this movie. His 
character, Harold Crick, slowly 
realizes that his boring life as a 
tax auditor may be narrated by 
a woman with a British accent.
It would be mega sexy (who 
doesn’t want a disembodied 
voice — with an accent no less
— following him around?) except 
for one major concern: He might 
just be going crazy. Stranger 
Than Fiction is a little surreal and 
very entertaining — and if that’s 
how you describe yourself in 
personal ads, then I think you 
just found yourself a Saturday 
evening activity.
Riding Alone For 
Thousands of Miles
Sunday, February 18 
.8 10 12
Yimou Zhang + celluloid = sexy, 
sexy filmmaking. The artist behind 
Hero, House of Flying Daggers, and 
Curse of the Golden Flower takes 
his genius hand toward something 
a bit less flashy: the story of a man 
who travels hundreds of miles to 
complete the work of his dying 
documentarian son. Unfortunately, 
there’s nothing inherently sexy 
about that, but nevertheless, you 
can expect Zhang’s typical stunning 
cinematography and stirring 
performances. Basically, if you’ve 
seen any of his other movies, you 
know what to expect — this time 
there’s just less kicking.
the..sex.issue Q
pillbox 02.12.07

---------------------------------------------------

;Sh a wn m Jp tf».1. We are sexual beings.
There's a common statistic thotsay:- gnvsth:nk^)out^x e' <517 four seconds.' This ” 
is not true. We can go substantillamounts of Urne wifhout riiinldngahyUnng sexual ";i; 
However, it is in oui nature ancMeKtoste^fc to be sex-driven. Sg^Bines it’s hard* not 
to listen to that WBBr
2. We aren’t all pretty boys, but.«
We worry more about our appearance than we like to let on. I’m not talking about the 
obviously narcissistic guys — even the ones that don't try to look like Abercrombie 
models probably worry about their appearances more than you’d think. Giving a guy a 
compliment about something physical, other than the obvious, is always appreciated.
lg pmnom^on until marriage. We are
irek. We \ij$|never l^dne
rate; we are flatulence's overlooked
3. We are assholes.
not okay and guys know that. The media often mixes sex and violence, but any guy 
in his right mind knows it's not real. He has power issues that would take years of 
psychotherapy to treat. Get out now. You will find someone better.
4. Durr...
Most of the time we’re not just ''acting” stupid:., we really are that dense in terms of 
common sense and the "'signals" girls give us. It doesn't mean that we don’t care; we 
just need little pushes in. the right direction. :
1. We fart.
It's true. No man will witness 
human and subject to some unbei 
of a guy or high-five and buy a r 
victims. There. I said it.
2. We don’t find high maintenance attractive.
A guy who shows no concern about his appearance isn't appealing, but spending 
oodles of time prepping for a date is unattractive. Going to the tanning bed may make 
you feel better about the stud in the mirror, but good luck finding a girl who won't 
laugh when she finds your Buy-Ten:Minutes~Get-Three-Minutes-Free card. You wear 
the pants, we'll wear the lip gloss.
3. We appreciate chivalry.
Nothing serves as a better display of politeness and respect than opening a door for a 
girl Not only does chivalry convey a respect for women in general, it shows that you 
hold her in high regard. A guy shouldn’t feel obligated to lay his waistcoat across a 
puddle and help his date into the carnage, but opening the car door speaks louder 
than sweet nothings. '< -
4. We eat a lot. A LOT.
Gorging oneself is taboo because of the ideal, thin bodies in magazines and on 
television. Ask any girl about her eating habits and she will likely be reluctant to 
divulge, but the reality is we love food almost as much as we love Jude Law. We eat 
French fries and pizza, but tend to let self-consciousness hold us back. No, females 
are not equipped with a salad-craving gene, and most of us love food, but until we 
dethrone Gisele Bundchen and the staple bikini model on the doim-room 'walls of 
male college students, we’ll have the salad... and a diet Coke.
5. We’ve practiced our signature using our first name and your last name.
Or at least “tried on” your last name. Unlike with shoes, however, we don’t 
immediately toss away a combination that sounds worse than Apple Paltrow, noi do 
we have tangible, concrete expectations of appending % 
trying on an outfit that looks noticeably unfitting or heinous, tl 
idle curiosity. Don't panic.
6. We don’t care if she’s “Just your friend."
Until you can produce legal evidence that that girl is Indeed your| 
prone to assume that infidelity-related mischief Is-afoot/ 
paranoia, I can’t imagine any girl completely at ease with the thought of her boy 
spending excessive time alone with another girl. This doesn’t mean we want a 
monopoly on your social lives or demand that you worship the ground we walk on, 
but that we enjoy any reminder of your fidelity.
7. We like sincere compliments.
"Nice rack" does not count. A simple acknowledgement of what we find important 
can easily brighten a girl’s day. Say you’re dating a girl with a keen eye for fashion
— telling her that you find her outfit eye-catching can fix a bad day and gain you easy 
brownie points.
8. We don’t always want a relationship.
Not all girls live and die by the exclusive-relationship-or-nothing-at-all ultimatum. As 
college students, we are all embracing sexual freedom, and more people are aware of 
the benefits ofplaying the field. With serious relationships come trade-offs, and with 
plenty of time to spare before we have to start acting like adults, casual dating can be 
very exciting and just as fulfilling as a relationship.
9. We could describe every photo of you on Facebook, in order of date.
Just like some people keep tabs on their significant others by phone bombardment, 
Facebook provides a window into the male-female interactions that albums document
— it really has taught all of us a behave-or-be-blackmailed mentality and even the 
most innocuous photo of a certain guy groping another girl mid-keg stand can send a 
confusing message to the determined spy.
10. We don’t care how much you can bench press.
The alpha-male obsession with the gym perplexes me, and nothing ruins a 
conversation faster than a guy talking up his biceps, quads, lats, or other four- to five- 
letter abbreviated muscle group. Taking pride in one’s body is one thing, but allotting 
more attention to your six-pack than to a girl who shows interest in you is about as
10
tasteful as Hulk Hogan’s daughter.
the..sex.issue.
5. We really do have one-track minds.
It’s not always the same thing, but it's very hard for us to multitask. Once a guy starts 
something, he Has to see it through to completion. If a guy seems to be forgetting 
things all the time, maybe he just needs to hear it differently. Teach him to pay 
attention to detail.
•
always loud.
iuiet evenings and talking can be fun. If a guy who doesn’t usually talk about himself 
starts spilling stuff to you, you should listen. Not to remember what he's saying, but 
because it’s something rare. On the other hand, there are those guys who talk about 
nothing but themselves. Don’t let them think that’s okay by pretending to listen.
7. We are assholes.
A guy who is full of himself is just using you as a tool to support his own vanity.
' ^
8. We are diverse in our sexual know-how.
It may surprise you who's great in bed and who’s still learning. This can be a touchy 
subject If he’s doing something wrong, let him know. He’ll appreciate it (and so — in 
turn — will yo
9. We are emotional, and we don’t know how to feel about that.
Guys aren’t built with a strong emotional foundation, and are often raised to suppress 
the few emotions they have. It’s becoining acceptable for males to share these 
emotions, but if a guy is always whining to you about the same things, he’s confused. 
There’s something else bothering him. Either help him try to figure out what's wrong 
or give him a reality check (e.g. “Maybe we just aren't right for each other.’’).. ^
10. We are expansive thinkers.
One of the greatest talents guys are born with is making abstract connections 
between things (because of the increased white matter in the brain). While this is 
what allows him to think cars are “sexy," it can allow for more interesting (to you as a 
girl) pursuits as well. Be careful when teasing a guy about something he's created, or 
anything that’s come out of his mind. We’re raised to think this is not manly, so when 
it happens we shouldn’t be shot down.

What’s the most romantic thing 
you’ve ever done?
One time-I dragged a guitar to school 
and serenaded a girl with her favorite 
song. That sounds romantic unless 
you’ve ever actually heard me sing. -LR
An elaborate Valentine's Day present 
involving a scavenger hunt, confetti, 
and me getting dizzy from blowing up 
too many balloons. -SM
I stayed in a nice, romantic hotel in a 
wonderful (and expensive) little town in 
Canada, then walked around at night 
under the stars. With my boyfriend, I 
should add. -JT
What’s the craziest/most hilarious 
thing you ever believed about sex 
as a kid?
We had to explain to my cousin once 
that a dick does not necessarily stick 
straight out perpendicular to the body 
when fully aroused. We demonstrated 
the proper angle with a remote control. 
-MB
I got nothing for this one. I found my 
mom's copy of "The Joy of Sex" when I 
was like, seven. I knew way too much, 
way too soon. On the plus side, I was 
the coolest kid on the school bus that 
week. -LR
When I was four, I thought that my boy 
cousin had a baby carrot between his 
legs. I spent an hour asking people what 
it was and no one would answer me. Fi­
nally, I threw a temper tantrum because 
no one would respond and got sent to 
time out. -PN
If you could spend a night with any 
superhero, who would it be? (And 
why?)
Spiderman — spandex is really hot. -LS
Definitely Spiderman, but only if he 
was "played by” Tobey Maguire. That 
upside-down kiss in the rain was fiiiine.
I think he’s only into redheads though, 
so sucks for me. -LT
Batman. Grappling hook? Hello? Wait: 
threesome with Batman and Robin is 
out of the question, right? -SK
Lex Luthor, even though he's a supervil­
lain. I dig men with issues. -SM
Poison Ivy, or maybe just Poison Ivy 
from Batman Forever. A.k.a. Uma Thur­
man. Oh wait, Poison Ivy is a villain. 
Then I pick the superhero in My Super 
Ex-Girlfriend.
-DT
What is a way to seduce/attract a 
potential significant other that not
many people know about?
Be a klutz. Maybe they’ll pick up what­
ever you drop or offer to dry-clean the 
shirt you just spilled your drink all over. 
At first, it’s cute. -JT
Accio love, baby. Standard Book of 
Spells, Grade Three. Duh. -SB-H
Pretend you have E.S.P; pretend you 
can determine what number they are 
thinking betwe'en one and 10. If you get 
it right, be like, "See, told ya so.” If you 
get it wrong, be like, "Oh, I just wanted 
an excuse to talk to you.” It’s cute. Be 
embarrassed. -MB
What’s your favorite body part of 
the people you date?
FIRM BUTT! -LT
Eyes and lips visually I think the tactile 
favorites remain constant throughout 
the male gender, so I’ll leave them out. 
-DT
The brain. TOTALLY hot. -SB-H
What’s the most embarrassing 
thing that has ever happened to 
you on a date?
I once dated this guy who got like a 
1600 on his SATs and he would correct 
my grammar. I was really embarrassed, 
but then I was like, “I’m getting the hell 
out of here.”
-LT
In ninth grade, I accidentally hit a boy in 
the face while trying to make out with 
him. -CM
I realized it wasn't a date. -SM
I didn't know I was dating someone for 
about a month — that’s kind of embar­
rassing. -KL
I had a date with a guy who was ob­
sessed with coffee, which I didn’t like 
too much, but I drank a whole big pot 
anyway — and threw up all the way 
home.. -SB-H
Do you believe in love at first 
sight? True love? Destiny?
It has a lot to do with my mood — or 
what song I’m listening to (unless it’s 
The Postal Service’s “Nothing Better,” 
in which case I sympathize with both 
sides). Overall, the way I feel is usu­
ally the opposite of my love life: When 
I’m dating someone, it probably isn’t 
destiny; when I’m admiring from afar, it 
is. -SM
Of course I believe in love at first sight. 
How do you explain my long, fruitful 
relationship with my iPod? -LR
How did your love life change 
when you came to CMU?
I realized how many people there were 
in the world, and if I didn't find some­
one right away, it wasn’t a catastrophe. 
-LS
Before I came to CMU, my love life was 
the pits. But now, the women are flow­
ing like wine, and my love life is thriving 
like the U.S. economy. -MS
Changed? More like screeched to a halt. 
Anyway, it’s been weird, disappointing, 
and a little too much like an angst-filled 
song by Fall Out Boy. -SM
I fell for Tank the robot receptionist, but 
it broke my heart. -SB-H
...Who has time? -LK
Do opposites attract? Is there a 
limit on that?
Opposites do attract, but there is a limit. 
If after one week you run out of things 
to talk about, the two of you aren’t soul 
mates. -LS
They do, as long as they have some­
thing significant in
common. You can of course date some­
one of a different
major or profession, but then you both 
generally should be interested in your 
respective fields for similar reasons or 
passions. At least, that’s how it has 
worked for me. -JT
I think a certain level of antagonism 
is needed. What fun would it be if you 
always agreed on everything? But life 
is not a sitcom: your hot, sloppy, hippie 
Democrat neighbor is not interested in 
your uptight, neat-freak Republican self. 
-LR
Yes, in the male/female way or music/ 
lyrics kind of way, but not in the funda­
mentalist/atheist or pacifist/assassin 
kind of way. -SB-H
Say something interesting about 
sex/love.
Please tell me if we’re going on a date, 
because chances are I don't know it’s a 
date. -KL
Flowers should be given anytime, 
anywhere. -JT
Don’t have preconceived notions about 
anything. They’ll be proven wrong. -LS

never in there, especially some of the scandalous stories of 
loving celebrities.... They’re fun stories.”
But enough about the book... You want to know what I wanted 
to know, and while you can read it in his book (or watch it in 
his...documentary), what could be easier than reading it here? 
Everyone loves a quickie.
On the steel city: “I love Pittsburgh. It’s like a blue-collar 
town; nice architecture, friendly people — very friendly people
— and very attractive women. Nice clubs, good food...”
On men and women, sex and love, and dogs: "Men 
don’t seem to get jaded. Women sometimes do, but not all 
of them do; some of them just love recreational sex as well.... 
There’s [sex] and there's making love. There’s different 
feelings. It involves different parts of the brain sometimes.— 
the hypothalamus, the cerebrum — it gets a little confusing. 
But the fact of it is, women who make sex for a living ... often 
find that they’re making money for having recreational sex, 
and for them it’s either love or money; romance, or paycheck. 
The thing is, men are dirty dogs. We like sex no matter what."
On not being jaded: “I’ll take recreational sex as well. I still 
love it; it hasn’t lost its appeal for me one iota. I see a new 
face, a new body, I’m all into it.”
On things he wouldn’t do: “I wouldn't do anything gay.
Not that "there’s anything wrong with it, but I couldn’t get a 
rise in my Levis.... And I would never do a violent film."
On the ideal woman: "All guys will agree with me. You 
know, we would take enthusiasm over gorgeous looks.
I'd rather have a girl who might not be as good looking, 
but just really enjoys messing around, enjoys me, enjoys 
my personality, enjoys my schmeckle; versus a girl who’s 
absolutely breathtaking but is just going through the motions.

With over 4000 women under his belt — and in his pants
— Ron Jeremy is an intimidating force to be reckoned with. 
What do you ask a man whose entire career can be summed 
up in nine inches?
This past Week, I struggled with the same question. After 
a few days of strenuous research, I decided to begin with 
the reason he came to Pittsburgh in the first place, his book: 
Ron Jeremy: The Hardest (Working) Man in Hollywood. This 
past Friday, his book signing at Joseph-Beth Booksellers in 
the South Side brought some Pittsburgh porn fans out of 
the woodwork; Jeremy was welcomed with oohs and ahs, 
cameras, and people trying to shake his hand.
“Check out the pictures in the book,” he said to the crowd, 
before he began signing. I picked up a copy and flipped 
through. I was a little disappointed in the graphic content
— breasts, breasts, and more breasts, but no documentation 
of the hedgehog’s famous, self-referenced "schmeckle.”
Dressed in wind-pants, sandals, and a T-shirt, Jeremy stood 
signing books and taking pictures. His hair was uncombed, 
and he looked completely at ease signing books and kissing 
women (and babies) — yeah, he was quite the unlikely porn 
star, and with over 1000 adult films to his name, perhaps 
an even more unlikely author. But Ron Jeremy Hyatt is a 
well-educated man; he earned bachelor’s degrees in both 
education and theater as well as a master’s degree in special 
education from Queen’s College, City University of New York. 
In the end, it kind of makes sense that he would write a book, 
too.
“I was approached in the past about doing a book,” said 
Jeremy, "and I was never satisfied with the money that was 
offered or the people involved, and then finally Harper Collins 
made an offer to me that I liked, and I said, 'Sure, why not?’ 
There were a lot of things that were not in my documentary 
Porn Star: The Legend of Ron Jeremy, a lot of facts that were
about pleasing myself.’ I want a girl who wants to please 
herself, too — [one] that’s really horny and enthusiastic."
And to finish: Jeremy is not married, Jeremy does not have 
any children, and Jeremy has only had one STD, gonorrhea, 
which he got while he was a special education teacher. He 
gets checked every week.

themselves. Still, don’t be so hasty to delete your Facebook 
account. It’s unlikely that Mindkin will ever replace Facebook 
and its kin in the world of online socializing. After all, a lot 
of people believe that “opposites attract" — people don't just 
want friends with similar interests. Often, you’re great friends 
with people who you really don’t have anything in common 
with at all.
Right now, Mindkin is in beta testing, and open only to CMU 
students; however, expansions toward global membership are 
expected in the near future.
If there is enough support for Mindkin from the students, the 
LCD — on display all last week in Kirr Commons — may be 
made a permanent feature. Perhaps Mindkin will become 
CMU's e-Fence (as one Mindkin user thought), the online 
version of that old rickety thing where lovers used to meet in 
the days of Andrew Carnegie.

---------------------------------------------------

Five conversations you need to have
From sex to ambitions to friends — ‘we need to talk’
Also, find the line between sharing too little and sharing too much. Information 
overflow can be a turn-off.
“I’m not a secrets person, but it's nice sometimes to spare your partner of 
certain things,” said Miller. “For example, I don’t think it’s necessary to say,
‘My ex was better endowed than you.’ ’’
Talking about talking about talking...
Communication is a central aspect of all relationships, but sometimes it’s a 
good idea to have a talk about talking. Making sure that your significant other 
is comfortable telling you things and that you are also comfortable talking to 
him or her about what’s important so you can strengthen your relationship. 
"Talking about communication — I think that’s the most Important thing," 
said Mirabella. “I feel like communication covers it all, because if you can’t 
communicate, you’re not really in a relationship."
Sex spectrums
Have an idea of where your partner is sexually. Mismatched experience 
levels are often the cause of discomfort and insecurity — not to mention 
awkward moments. Discussing them can be a relief for the experienced and 
inexperienced alike. “Talk about where they are sexually and where you are
— what does that mean for your relationship?” said Jessica Winn, a junior 
political science major. “You need to be able to have an honest conversation 
where you're not worried about whether what you say is touchy.”
The number of people that your partner has been with, for example, can have 
an impact on your impression of him or her. For first-year business major Brett 
Cannaday, this number is a large player in whether he is willing to date a girl.
"I figure out if she’s datable or not by finding out how many guys she’s been 
with," he said. ,
Some consider numbers to be irrelevant, however. Frydman countered, “I don’t 
think it really matters how many people [your] partner has been with as long 
as when he’s with you, he’s with you. And as long as he was safe about it and 
tested.”
A more sensitive — but equally important — conversation is about the 
consequence of contraceptives gone wrong. "One thing I always worry about 
is if I got pregnant — where would he stand in this situation?” Miller said. "You 
shouldn’t be sexually active with someone if you're not in agreement on that 
situation.”
Social conventions often make certain subjects taboo, and engaging 
conversations about them can be painfully awkward. Still, there's no better 
way to get to know someone or to address issues that could otherwise breed 
discomfort. While most of these examples have been heavier, more serious 
issues, there are the fun ones too. “I want to talk to [girls] and find out why 
The Notebook is the best movie ever!" joked Astor. The only way to do it is by 
talking.
Su Chu | Junior Staffwriter

Initiating important 
conversations can be 
incredibly awkward, but 
they are universal to 
healthy relationships. 
From the trivial to the 
news-making (and 
sometimes relationship- 
breaking), here are some 
conversations you should 
consider having with 
your partner.
Labeling
Definitions are bound to come up as a subject for conversation when 
entering a serious relationship. It can be difficult to gauge when to drop 
questions concerning how exclusive you want the relationship to be or 
when you want to go public. Talking about these issues can help resolve any 
burning questions you have about the state of your relationship. Otherwise, 
you might end up having to resort to the Internet. "I love how it’s official 
when you put it on Facebook,” said Carla Miller, a first-year in MCS.
Space and privacy
How much is too mufch? Talk about spending time apart from each other, 
and maybe spend those extra hours working on other relationships, such 
as those you share with your friends. “You need to make sure you maintain 
your own identity and friends," said Galit Frydman, a junior biology major. 
“Maintain your own relationships!" Don’t spend time with your partner 
to the exclusion of all else; friends provide safety nets if your relationship 
sours.
What about your partners’ friends? If there are many reservations when 
it comes time to meet them, you might want to analyze the situation; a 
hesitation could indicate unresolved issues. You don’t need to be best 
friends with your partner's friends, but feeling accepted can prevent 
future stress in the relationship. “I think if they really want you to be 
part of their life, they would want you and welcome you into that 
part," Frydman said. “It's also a really good way to get to know 
them if you get to know their friends.”
Other issues to address might include prior relationships. "Talking 
about past relationships — I think that’s pretty important,” 
said Michelle Mirabella, a first-year in H&SS. Relating your 
previous experiences can communicate the issues you feel 
strongly about and help your partner be aware of the things 
you might be sensitive to. It helps to reduce the possibility of 
miscommunication.
I want to know you
Finding out what you're comfortable with around your partner is 
important, and what you're insecure about equally so. Address 
readiness to communicate, religious views, and relationship 
goals. "Personal aspirations — what a person’s all about, who 
are they, and where are they going," said Jeremy Astor, a senior 
business major. "I think that's the whole dating process: your 
evaluation of who a person is."

See that guy over there? The one sitting two seats to the left? Yeah, 
he totally hates Valentine’s Day. The fact that he’s a guy is a dead 
giveaway.
Things sure can get complicated and busy really quickly around here. 
This isn’t so much a prediction of something that will happen, but rather 
a general observation. Oh wow! The sky is blue today!
Reconsider your time management. For example, maybe physics 
recitation isn’t the best time to shave your ass. You might give the 
professor the wrong impression.
The best thing about a lousy week is that it’ll take very little for things 
to get better. Think about that when you take a nasty spill on the way 
to class. By the way, I’m pretty sure all those people are laughing with 
you. Otherwise, that would just be mean.
Everyone loves to dress sexy once in a while. However, it’s freaking cold 
outside and it’s more important to dress appropriately.
Let's face some facts. It’s Valentine’s Day this Wednesday. If you have 
to get something, just buy it on Thursday when everything gets reduced 
by 80 percent. Take that, Hallmark!
Time to heat things up. This week at Taco Bell, it’s time to go up to Fire 
Sauce. Sorry, Mild, you're just not cutting it anymore.
Now would be a good time to finalize your spring break plans. You can 
stay here in Pittsburgh, but normally people don’t associate spring with 
freezing temperatures. Like, not even in Siberia, which is lovely that time 
of year, by the way.
This week, I recommend taking some advice from the Cookie Monster: 
“C is for cookie, and that’s good enough for me.” Then again, parents 
now blame him for obesity in today’s youth. The moral of the story is to 
never enjoy anything you used to.
When you really think about it, whipped cream has so many uses. 
Really.
Dropping your cell phone into the toilet will prove to be a great thing 
when you later get the urge to call your ex. Trust me, they’re still a 
jerk.
A little bit of bad news this week. Despite the fact that you’ve stubbed 
your toe on the same door every day since last semester, you still won’t 
learn to avoid it, as you do it another four times.
