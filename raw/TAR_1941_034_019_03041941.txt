The Light, Fantastic
Elizabeth Waters, Dance Team 
Give Modern Dance Exhibition
“Dancers En Route” will be here 
at Thistle Hall tomorrow at 3:30 
p. m. and Thursday at 8:15 p. m. 
In a new and highly entertaining 
manner Miss Waters and her 
dancers will give their version of 
modem dance. Many of the in­
terpretations are based on themes 
by Ted Shawn with whom Mr. Sam 
Steen, one of the group, once 
danced. The troupe is attempting 
to use the modern music of Ray- 
.mond Scott and the Calypso sing­
ers as a basis for their “modern' 
ballet.”
Despite the fact that the group 
is trying very hard to forget the 
barnstorming days of not so long 
ago they still travel, props and 
other paraphernalia, in one car. 
Last week they gave a studio pre­
view before some of the “big 
/shots,” so now they can be con­
sidered well on their way to 
fame and fortune with the aid of 
these critics. Pittsburgh can add 
to its list of “favorite sons” the 
name of Sam Steen who is a na­
tive Pittsburgher and received his 
original training here. Both Eliza­
beth Waters and Linda Locke were 
formerly- with the Hanya Holm 
Group.
The program ia> being sponsored 
by the Carnegie Tech Women’s 
Department of Physical Education. 
Miss Dorothy Kanrich, instructor 
in this department, and the Tech 
Dance Club will be selling the 
tickets. The tickets range in price 
from fifty cents for Techites to 
seventy-five cents for outsiders 
•and a dollar for reserved tickets. 
Any camera fans who would like 
to get some pictures are invited to 
Taring their cameras.

Required Factor 
For Honoraries 
Stumps Council
Student Council, at its regular 
meeting last week, again took up 
the matter of revision of class 
honoraries.
Mr. Burton first read the revis­
ed Delta Skull constitution, and 
Mr. Cullen asked why the fac­
tor requirement had been low­
ered to 1.5 instead of the original 
2.00. Mr. McGarvey replied that 
he had heard comment on the 
campus that there are enough 
scholastic honoraries, and that 
class honoraries should not have 
to l^e subject to such a high fac­
tor requirement.
A discussion by several mem­
bers of Council followed concern­
ing the advisability of keeping a 
high or low factor requirement. 
The main issue seemed to be that 
a student having a 1.5 factor runs 
the risk of falling beneath this if 
he enters too many activities.
Mr. Cullen finally moved that 
the Delta Skull constitution be 
approved with the exception of 
the clause concerning the factor 
requirement, which should be left 
up to the discretion of the Points 
Committee, and this was passed.
Mr. Sions moved that the Presi­
dent of the class in Engineering 
be made president of the corre­
sponding honorary but the motion 
was not seconded and after some 
discussion it was dropped.
Mr. McGarvey read the new 
constitution for the Dragons and 
Mr. Murton read the constitution 
of the Scimitars. Discussions again 
ensued concerning the factor re­
quirements, which are at present 
1.5 for admission to both honor­
aries. Both constitutions were 
tabled until tonight’s meeting.
Mr. Durbin reported that he had 
received official confirmation that 
the difficulty had been cleared up 
with the Musicians’ Union and 
that Carnegie Tech was no long­
er on the musicians’ blacklist. He 
explained that at a meeting he 
had had with Union officials noth- 
definite was settled, but on the 
following day he received a tele­
phone call from the president of 
the Union stating that Tech was 
off the blacklist. However, the 
president of the Union refused to 
give an explanation for the sud­
den removal.
Mr. Durbin also reported that 
negotiations were proceeding to 
get Tommy Dorsey for Spring 
Carnival.

Tau Beta Pi, national engineer­
ing honorary, the engineers’ Phi 
Beta Kappa, has just announced 
the list of eight juniors to whom 
bids have been extended. These 
complete the selection of men for 
this year.
Eligibility requirements state 
that the .candidates must be jun­
iors whose scholastic standing 
places them in the upper eighth 
of the class. Acceptance is also 
based on the personality, charac­
ter, and activities of the men.
From the men interviewed the 
following juniors were chosen: 
Jack Bowers, Westinghouse, Elec­
trical; George Margerum, Civil; 
Stanley Malinski, Mechanical; 
Donald Moore, Chemical; Saul 
Moses, Chemical; Harry Owen, 
Mechanical; Frank Stulen, Aero­
nautical; and Ernest Ziga, Me­
chanical.
Each man is required to write 
an’ essay on a topic chosen by 
members of the fraternity and 
approved by the advisory bpard. 
At the first pledge meeting which 
was held yesterday the topic “Ed­
ucation as a Bulwark of Democ­
racy,” was assigned. The winning 
composition will receive an award 
from the local chapter and will 
be entered in national competi­
tion. The next pledge meeting will 
be held next Monday.
The formal initiation will be 
held Friday afternoon, March 21, 
at the Union. That evening a 
formal dinner, a recent innova­
tion, will be held in honor of the 
recently installed members.
On March 25 Tau Beta Pi is 
sponsoring a unique assembly in 
the Carnegie Music Hall. It will 
present as its attraction the com­
plete World’s Fair Exhibit of the 
Bell Telephone Company and the 
Bell Laboratories Exhibit.
Zworykin Talks 
About Electrons 
At Mellon Institute
Dr. V. K. Zworykin, noted 
physicist and director of the Elec­
tronic Research Laboratory of the 
Radio Corporation of America at 
Camden, N. J., will give an ad­
dress on “Image Formation by 
Electrons,” at the Mellon Insti­
tute Auditorium on Saturday 
evening, March 8. Dr. Zworykin’s 
lecture which is sponsored by 
the Carnegie Tech chapter of the 
Society of the Sigma Xi, national 
research honorary, is scheduled 
for 8:15 P. M., and is open to the 
public.
The lecture will reveal many in­
teresting facts about the scope 
of the Electron Microscope, new­
est wonder of the scientific world, 
which is from 20 to 50 times more 
powerful than the ordinary light 
microscope in opening new vistas 
of research to virtually every field 
of science. It will be illustrated 
with photographs, taken with the 
new microscope, of virus and oth­
er minute particles magnified up 
to 10,000 times.
Dr. Zworykin is holder of 74 
U. S. patents and has made many 
important contributions to the de­
velopment of radio and television. 
He received his higher education 
at the Petrograd Institute of Tech­
nology and College de France, in 
Paris. He has been director of the 
RCA Electronic Research Labora­
tory since 1929, and is well known 
as an author on widely divergent 
scientific subjects. A native of 
Russia, he became a naturalized 
U. S. citizen in 1924. From 1920 to 
1929 he was a member of the re­
search staff of the Westinghouse 
Electric and Manufacturing Com­
pany at East Pittsburgh.
Dr. Zworykin holds a degree in 
electrical engineering from Petro­
grad, the Ph.D. degree from Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh, and the D. 
Sc. degree was conferred on him 
by the Brooklyn Polytechnic In­
stitute. In 1934 he was awarded 
the Morris Liebmann Memorial 
Prize for contributions to the de­
velopment of television and the 
Overseas Premium from the In­
stitution of Electrical Engineers 
(British). Last year he was selectj 
ed by the National Association of 
Manufacturers to receive the Mod­
em Pioneer Award.

Students who attended chapel 
last Tuesday were almost as im­
pressed by Dr. T. Z. Koo’s ex­
pressive gestures as they were 
with the subject of his message.
Dr. Koo spoke of the different 
cultural philosophies now preval­
ent in China and India. He com­
pared their attitudes to what ours 
might be in case of a crisis, which 
he feels will come about with 
Japan in a very short time, duo 
to the two opposite policies which 
the two countries are following 
in regard to Asia.
The fundamental importance 
of the Indian philosophy in time 
of crisis proved to be the way, in 
which the people could piusslvely 
resist oppression.
This contrasted to the Chinese 
motto: “Resist; fight; build; unite;” 
which every good citizen lias in 
the back of his mind, regardless 
of the increasing difficulties they 
faces each day.
Since education is the mark of 
superiority in China and because 
the leaders of the country rcalizo 
its importance, the schools and 
universities have been moved 
from the eastern coast inland 
about two thousand miles. All 
kinds of seemingly impossiblo 
situations have been overcome by 
the willingness and ardox^ of the 
Chinese students to learn. Both 
professors and students have 
trekked to temporary universities 
built of mud and straw in obscux*e, 
out-of-the-way places to study 
and leax-n so that they will be bet­
ter fitted to carry out the true 
Chinese philosophy.
Noted Composer Directs 'Opera
By Marianna Hogg
Mr. Lehman Engel, prominent 
New York director, will direct the 
Tech Drama Department’s next: 
production. The name of this mu­
sical comedy is “Beggar’s Opera,” 
an eighteenth centuiy play, by 
John Gay. The play will open on 
March 11 and continue until 
Mrach 18, with a matinee on 
March 14 at 3:30.
Mr. Engel has had a great deal 
of experience with the stage. He 
has composed music to “Within 
the Gates,” directed by Melvyn 
Douglas, “Murder in the Cathe­
dral,” directed by Halsted Welles, 
“Shoemaker’s Holiday,” directed 
by Orson Welles, “Hamlet” and 
“Family Portrait,” both directed 
by Margaret Webster. He con­
ducted the music for “Johnny 
Johnson,” directed by Lee Stras- 
berg, “Cradle Will Rock,” direct­
ed by Orson Welles, and “Little 
Dog Laughed,” directed by Eddie 
Dowling. 1-Ie is the conductor of 
the Madrigal Singers in more than 
500 concerts and 250 broadcasts 
and, last year, of the Texaco Star 
Theatre. He also composed music 
for various ballets for Martha [ 
Graham, Charles Weidman, Ra-i 
dio City Music Hall, and others.^
In addition, he is the author of 
“Renaissance to Baroque,” four; 
volumes concerning three cen­
turies of choral music. He has lec-{ 
tux-ed extensively and regularly 
at Sarah Lawrence College,: 
Neighborhood Playhouse, andj 
Katherine Gibbs School. He is the*
president of the Arrow Music 
Press, publishers of contemporary 
music. The basis for his success, 
was his education at Cincinnati 
Conservatory, Cincinnati College 
of Music, and Julliard Graduate 
School.
Concerning Tech talent, Mr. 
Engel says, “It is a great pleasure 
to work with the students at Tech 
whose enthusiasms are still so 
keen and whose interest in theater 
makes them alive to work even in 
spite of the pressure of so much 
activity. I have enjoyed working 
with all of the members of my 
cast, and I feel confident of poten­
tial brilliant futures in the theater 
for several of them.” This praise 
ought to mean a great deal to the 
cast, coming from a man with 
such knowledge of the stage.
The “Beggar’s Opera” offers 
great opportunities for direction 
since John Gay, the author-, gave 
little and unconfiding advice be­
yond the lines of the play itself. 
This eighteenth century com'*dy 
is as contemporary today as it was 
more than two centuries ago. The 
social .satire is as freshly true to­
day as in 1728, and the characters 
are, if not close personal friends, 
at least recognizable public ac­
quaintances of everyone today. 
The songs are adaptations of. the 
cux-rently popular songs . by 
Handel, Dr. Arne, Purcell, as well 
as a liberal spxinkling of Scotch 
and English folk songs. This cer­
tainly is one of the theatre’s 
unique works.
. The cast is as follows: Polly, 
Betsy Durkee; Peachum, Michael 
Sivy; Mrs. Peachum, Esther Jane 
Coryell; Lucy, Shirley Bx’own; Mr. 
Lockit, Tom Jones; Macheath, Carl 
Betz; Filch, Bob Challener; Jenny 
Diver, Ruth Orr; Mrs. Coaxer,

Noted Writer Talks 
On the Romance 
Of Being a Student
Phi Kappa Phi will bring to the 
Assembly today at 11:30 in the 
Theatre of the College of Fine 
Arts a very ndted and versatile 
speaker, Dr. Rollo Walter Brown, 
whose topic is “The Romance of 
Being A Student.”
Dr. Brown was born in south- 
eastex'n Ohio, in the mining re­
gion about which he has written 
in his ixovels, “The Firemakers,” 
and “Toward Romance.” He at­
tended Ohio Northern University 
and Harvard, and later taught 
English and Composition at Wa­
bash College, Caxieton and Harv­
ard. During the time he taught 
at Wabash, he took a year’s leave 
of absence to go to France where 
he wrote “How The French Boy 
Leax-ns to Write,” a study of the 
methods of teaching in the French 
lycees. It is interesting to note that 
Dr. Brown taught one of Carnegie 
Tech’s English professors, Lester 
Beattie. They were also colleagues 
at Caxieton College. Professor 
Beattie says, “Dr. Brown was 
one of the most stimulating teach- 
ex’s I ever had.”
“The Romance of Being A Stu­
dent," in which Dr. Brown ex­
pects to give his idea of the art, 
the science, and the philosophy of 
being a colloge student, should be 
of interest to everyone, as he deals 
optimistically with the students’ 
problems in setting out on their 
careers, rather than discusses tho 
problems of tho chaotic world to­
day. Dr. Brown finds that students 
in colleges and institutions are 
overfed on big international prob­
lems, and wish to hoar something 
ol! benefit to themselves. Ho has 
something that the students 
should like to hear, and ejoys 
speaking with them.
Dr. Brown is a lively speaker1—

One-man Exhibit
Robert Gwathomy, instructor 
in the Painting and Design De­
partment is having a one-man ex­
hibition at tho Contempoi’axy 
Bookshop, on Wood St. The show 
will bo hex'e for three weeks.
Mr. Gwathomy was this year’s 
winner of the American Contemp­
orary Art Gallexy, annual compe­
tition for a one-man show at the 
gallexy in New York. Mr. Gwa- 
themy appears to be something 
of a find. According to one x’eview- 
er, this young artist is “the most 
interesting one that these laudable 
competitions1 have yet unearthed. 
He has the double virtue of hav­
ing something to say and his own 
way of saying it. Unlike many of 
his younger contemporaries, there 
is nothing muddy or fumbled in 
his work. It is clear cut and vigor­
ous. At first glance it might seem 
that his aim was principally dec­
orative. But it is much more than 
that. It caxTies with it a subtle 
commentaxy on life and the times 
in which we live.”
Mr. Gwathomy possesses a dis­
tinct personality which plainly 
shows itself above his chosen con­
ventions, as well as a sensitivity 
for paint and pattex-n which defin­
itely distinguishes him as a real 
artist. Occasionally he employs 
caricature, as in Hitchhiker.
Most commented on by review- 
ers are Land of Cotton, the paint­
ing which won Gwathemy the A.
C. A. Gallery prize, Hitch Hiker, 
Two Aryans, Under The Elevated, 
Sharecroppers, Out of the South, 
and For Great Is Your Reward In

Bob Chester and his “rhythms 
of tomorrow” will provide the 
dance music for the Interftatern- 
ity Formal in the Hotel Sehenley 
on Friday night, March 14.
Bob formed his orchestra at the 
Detroit Athletic Club and, after 
an eight month engagement there, 
climbed up and up until he was 
playing at Frank Dailey’s Mead- 
owbrook and the Glen Island 
Casino. Bob and his orchestra in­
clude a combination of all tem­
pos in their music—sweet swing 
and dreamy—emphasizing the fin­
esse and the coloring of their ar­
rangements.
Upon graduating from the Uni­
versity of Dayton where he was 
a star pitcher on the baseball 
team, Bob played his saxophone 
with Ben Pollack and Ben 
Bernie. It was while attending 
Dayton University that he be­
came interested in the masters of 
modern music. Although his fam­
ily could have helped him—his 
step-father is Albert Fisher of the 
Fisher Body Corporation—Bob 
decided to shift for himself and
so organized his own band. Fea­
tured in Bob’s “show” for the I.-F. 
will be charming Betty Bradley, 
as vocalist.
The dance will last from 10 un­
til. 2 and the tickets will cost 
$3.50.

The Intersorority Formal gave 
us lots of good material and a 
bunch of unusual combinations— 
such as Betty Leister and Dick

Rodney, and Jean Waddington 
and Tony Laposlti.

Dot O’Brien, Argot Stockton,

with their jitlerbugging.
Bob Challener must have read 
Jeanne Howard’s mind before he

Since Bob Odell left town 
Gladys Jones finds that the old

Pop Campbell certainly knows

Madeline Forsythe certainly

Properties and amounts of coke 
and by-products obtained from the 
carbonization of coal can now be 
predetermined, Dr. H. H. Lowry, 
director of the Coal Research 
Laboratory of Carnegie Tech, an­
nounced today in New York City.
Dr. Lowry’s method establishes 
for the first time a formula where­
by an analysis of coal, correlated 
with the temperature at which it 
is to be coked (carbonized), ac­
curately forecasts the resulting 
qualities and amounts of coke and 
its by-products of tar, gas, and 
ammonium sulphate.
Dr. Lowry’s research is consid­
ered most important as offering 
industry increased economy and 
scientific control over the results 
of the coking process.
The economy results from the 
elimination of costly oven tests 
which may be 
replaced by the 
much simpler 
and cheaper 
analysis of the 
particular coal 
used. The con- 
trolresults 
from the abil­
ity to forecast 
what results 
any type of 
coal., will give 
under coking.
D r. Lowry’s 
paper was re­
leased before a 
meeting of the 
tute of Mining and Metallurgical 
Engineers in the Engineering Soci­
eties Building, New York.
One large steel company, Dr. 
Lowry revealed, has been able to 
save many thousands of dollars in 
the single item of eliminating the 
sulphur analysis of coke by using 
his formula for the past year.
Dr. Lowry’s research also as­
sures more accurate planning in 
the production of the coking by­
products, many of which are im- 
portant in the industrial defense

effort.
Carrying Dr. Lowry’s work a 
step further, M. A. Mayers and H. 
G. Landau, also of Carnegie’s Coal 
Research Laboratory, announced 
before the A.I.M.M.E. a method 
for controlling the properties of 
pig iron and the economy of its 
production in blast furnace oper­
ation.
This method ascertains the par­
ticular qualities in the coke neces­
sary to produce certain qualities 
and quantities of pig iron under 
specific conditions of operation 
and ore analysis.
Formulas were developed in this 
research whereby for the first time 
blast furnace operators may cal­
culate the quality, economy, and 
rate of production of pig iron from 
the properties of the coke used. 
For these calculations preliminary 
data, defined in the paper, must 
be collected on each specific blast 
furnace operation.
Although the importance of coke 
properties in pig ¿ron was always 
realized, no previous scientific 
method for forecasting results had 
been worked out because of the 
many variable conditions involved.
The Bard of Avon was riglit about the rose—its name 
is unimportant. But if he’d had anything to do with 
naming telephone exchanges, he’d have learned a lot!
Names must he easy to pronounce and transmit—must 
not look or sound like other exchange names—must 
not use the same dial finger spaces.
Take MUIR and OTIS, for example. Fine!—except 
they UToP alike! For the first two letters of each appear 
in the same finger spaces on the dial.
Qften hundreds of names are listed, studied, discarded 
before G43 is found that meets all requirements. Such 
care in every phase of Bell System work helps to make 
your telephone service the world’s finest.
Why nottelephone home often? Long Dis­
tance rates to most points are lowest any 
night after 7 P. M. and all day Sunday.

in fact, he told somebody that he 
never saw a student sleeping in 
any of his lectures. He has known 
thousands of students and has 
been lecturing to them for the 
past fifteen years.
Audiences at such institutions 
as Harvard, Columbia, Washing­

versity of Cincinnati et al. have 
appreciated his lectures so much 
that he was called back for re­
engagements. He has also lectur­

Teaches at Pitt 
Tech Professor
We have a “Fifth Columnist” 
among the Tech faculty. His name 
is Mr. Geoi’ge B. Thorp and he is 
an assistant professor in the Aero­
nautical Engineering Department. 
The appellation “fifth columnist” 
is applied to him because, while 
teaching at Tech, he is also teach­
ing at (of all places!) Pitt.
It seems that Pitt’s assistant 
professor of Aeronautical Engin­
eering, Henry Pavian, was an of­
ficer in the Naval Reserve. Be­
cause of the defense work being 
conducted by the Navy Mr. Pav­
ian was called to full-time serv­
ice with the Reserve. Due to the 
fact that aeronautical engineers 
are in great demand in this time 
of national emergency, and be­
cause Mr. Pavian had been the 
only man at Pitt qualified to in­
struct the seniors, they appealed 
to Tech for help. Mr. Thorp con­
sented to teach two courses to 
the senior aeronautical engineers: 
Airplane Structures and Airplane 
Design. He conducts six lectures 
a week as well as some laboratory 
work at “the school across the 
hollow.”
Professor Thorp enjoys his as­
sociation with • the Pitt senior 
Aero’s very much because those 
talcing the course must be in the 
upper third of their class. Conse­
quently they are “a wide awake 
bunch.” Mr. Thorp would also 
like to call attention to the splen­
did cooperation—contrary to pop­
ular belief—shown between the 
two. schools in this action.

Frederick Adler, 
Tech ’38, Directs 
NYA Symphony
Frederick Adler, who was a 
member of the Music School’s 1938 
Graduating class, will conduct the 
55-piece National Youth Adminis­
tration Sym­
phony Orches­
tra in its initial 
concert this 
evening at 8; 15 
in the Sehenley 
High School 
A u d i t o rium. 
Mr. Adler, who 
in addition to 
his ensemble 
work, is a pian­
ist. received his 
master’s degree 
in Music at 
New York Uni­
versity in 1939.
Guest soloist this evening will 
be Vincent Plundo of Greens- 
burg. -Mr. Plundo will play the 
Concerto No. 1 for Clarinet by 
Weber. The rest of the program 
consists of the Egmont Overture 
by Beethoven; Symphony No.-4 in 
D Minor by Schumann; and the 
Mississippi Suite by Ferde Grofe. 
Although this concert is the first 
that the NYA Orchestra has given, 
it broadcasts a half-hotir concert 
over a nation-wide Columbia 
hookup, under Mr. Adler’s direc­
tion.
The federal youth symphony or­
chestra was organized this year 
for the benefit of all young peo­
ple who wanted to play in a sym­
phony orchestra, and did not be­
long to any organizations that 
sponsored an orchestra. An im­
portant part of the government’s 
youth administration, it opens the 
way for many young people who 
are unable to attend schols that 
provide a music training.

TUESDAY, MARCH 4, 1941THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
Burch, Patton 
Star for Tech; 
Freshmen Lose
Carnegie Tech’s basketball team 
lost their sixteenth straight game 
at Morgantown last Saturday 
night to a superior West Virginia 
squad by the score of 65-39. The 
game was the same old story, 
Tech playing like a house afire 
during the first half, then, the op­
position forging ahead in the fin­
al period of the game to win by 
a large score. It was hoped that 
the Tartans would win one of 
these final three games but the 
outlook is still quite gloomy with 
but two games to go.
While the first team was in the 
game, Tech still had a possibility 
of winning, But the West Virginia 
boys forged ahead at the end of 
the second quarter when the sec­
ond team came into the game. 
The score had been tied 22-22 
when the substitution occurred, 
then the Mountaineers headed 
by McCartney, scored seven 
straight points to make the half- 
time score 29-22.
As the second half began, Tech
advanced to within several points 
of West Virginia, but about this 
time the same well known de­
tails occurred. The local boys be­
gan increasing their lead until 
they won the game by a large 
margin. The starting five stayed 
in the game until the fourth quar­
ter when they began to foul out, 
Burch, Iiolets, and Niederberger 
going out in this manner. After 
this the West Virginia boys had a 
large scoring spree, Baric and 
Ruch amassing a total of twenty 
points to Tech’s five.
In this game, Ruch scored 
twelve points to set a new West 
Virginia record for one season, 
previously held by Sleepy Glenn 
and Jack Gocke. Rudy Baric took 
individual scoring honors for the 
•game with 22 markers. For t the 
Skibo hoopsters, Burch was high 
man again with 11, Patton next 
with 10. and Hank Holets follow­
ing with eight. Scotty Hamilton 
was held to a total of two free 
throw.s, receiving- these on Burch’s 
last foul of the game.
West Virginia’s Freshmen beat 
the Carnegie Tech plebes again in 
the preliminary, 37-20. Tech scor­
ed only six points in the second 
half after holding the Mountaineer 
Freshmen to a 16-14 count in the 
first half. Showman was high man 
for the Tartans with eight tallies.

Grove City, Temple 
Relinquish Laurels 
During Last Week
The Tech mermen took two 
meets this week, one from Grove 
City and the other from Temple. 
The Grove City meet took place 
last Tuesday at Grove City. The 
whole contest was rather irreg­
ular because of the unusually 
short pool, which was only 37 
feet in length. ^All the practice 
for this meet was done in the 
width of our pool because of this 
irregularity. For instance, the 440 
yard freestyle took 34 lengths in-

With the coming of spring (we 
hope) many of the mid-winter 
Intramural sports are reaching the 
ends of their schedules and cham­
pionship games are in the offing. 
For the first time since the activ­
ities began we are able to bring 
to the students some concise re­
sults and predictions concerning 
basketball, p .volleyball, squash, 
badminton and handball.
The standing of the top three 
teams in the fraternity and in­
stead of the usual 17 lengths. This 
made it rather difficult for the 
Tech swimmers because of the 
increased amount of turns neces­
sary. Another odd feature of this 
meet was the absence of a diving 
event due to the lack of a diving 
board. I-Iowever, despite all these 
unusual conditions, the Tartans 
did themselves proud by winning 
with a score of 39 to 27.
The Temple meet took place in 
Philadelphia in the Conwell Hall 
pool. This was Temple’s last meet 
of the season, and it was a very 
unfitting end for the Owls as the 
Skibos won a decisive victory with 
a score of 44% to 30%. Temple 
started out in fine fettle with a 
victory ,in the 300 yard medley re­
lay, but Tech’s Boehmig and Carv­
er took first and third places in 
the 220 yard freestyle. Captain 
Molvie and Burtis of Tech took 
first and second places in the 50 
yard freestyle, but Temple follow­
ed this with a first and second in 
the diving event. Molvie and 
Burtis again starred in a victory 
over the opponents in the 100 
yard freestyle, but again the Owls 
retaliated with a first and second 
in the 150 yard backstroke. 
Temple took both first and second 
places in the 150 yard breast 
stroke with Loper of Tech plac­
ing third. Boehmig took first in 
the 440 yard freestyle and Turn- 
ock supplemented with a second in 
the same meet.. Tech took the im- 
poi'tant final event, the 400 yard 
relay, with Molvie, Burtis, Carver 
and Brown swimming.
Molvie and Boehmig swam sen­
sationally in the Temple meet, be-' 
cause of taking firsts in both the 
Grove City meet and the contest 
with Temple on Saturday. Their 
events were rather close together, 
which did not give them much 
time to rest for their second 
events.

An analysis of the fraternity 
tabulation informs us that the D. 
U.’s have been beaten only by the 
S. A. E.’s, the Kappa Sigs have 
bowed only to the D. U.’s, and the 
S. A. E.’s and Kappa Sigs have 
not played each other as-yet. That- 
game will nearly decide’the out­
come as far as the S. A. E.’s are 
concerned. At the present reading 
the Citcom Clan looks like a sure 
winner of the Independent League
unless they fall by the wayside in 
their game with Scobell Hall on 
Wednesday night. This game will 
be the preliminary to the Tech- 
Penn State tilt.
Drawing the season to a close 
last night the Betas and the PiKa’s 
finished off the last volley ball 
match scheduled. In the semi­
final the Betas were victorious 
over the Tau Delts and the 
PiKA’s won over Magill Hall.
Because of lack of space it will 
be impossible to tabulate the 
Handball, Squash, and Badminton 
results, so for these I refer you to 
the bulletin board in the Gymnas­
ium.
There are now only three more 
Intramural sports left for compe­
tition this year: Softball, Foul 
Shooting, and Swimming. Already 
the swimming and foul shooting 
schedules have been arranged and 
teams are scheduling practice 
hours in the pool. All swimming 
entries must be in by tomorrow, 
and competition begins the week 
of March 17. It is absolutely im­
perative that all competing teams 
get in the required number of 
practices (two per week) before 
competition starts.
w. A. A. NEWS
• By BETTY PARKER -
W. A. A. basketball is hitting 
an all high with a game scheduled 
with Duquesne and many more 
in the offing if we can get an en­
thusiastic and good team. All you 
basketballers from crack high 
school teams had better come out 
and show the good old Tech spir­
it. Renew your sport strength. 
Come on now, we know you were 
all enthusiasts in high school, and 
Tech needs just your kind of sup­
port. If the basketball team can­
not schedule many good games, the 
fault will be with each and every 
one of you who have failed to 
come out with your support.
A badminton tournament and a 
ping pong rally are going in full 
swing, the results being posted on 
the board in Maggie Murph and 
Arts. These are wonderful winter 
sports, that is indoor, sports, and 
each is becoming increasingly 
popular as the months go by. Take 
in an hour of ping pong or. bad­
minton at your next opportunity. 
You won’t regret it; it’s; loads of 
fun!
Another conference at Penn 
State is on the W. A. A. calendar 
for the near future. About ten 
delegates will be sent, and we are 
sure all of you will want to go.
Of course, that is impossible, and 
the board has not decided just 
how to choose the delegates, but 
whoever goes, you will all be in­
terested in the results and the new 
ideas brought back. More about 
that latex*. For now, we will be 
content and stop raving about all 
these sports if you, meaning just 
you, shake a limb, lose a pound, 
and join our sports.

Tartan ROTC 
Rifle Squad 
Defends Title
Carnegie Tech’s ROTC rifle 
team competed in a telegraph 
match of the Third Corps Area 
last Saturday. In these matches 
the score of each individual team 
is compiled and telegraphed in to 
a central office where the results 
are tabulated and the winner de­
cided upon. As yet the victor of 
Saturday’s match is not known 
but the Tartans are confident of 
at least being near the top, since 
four members of this year’s ¿quad 
were on last season’s champion­
ship team. All colleges in the 
Third Corps Area that have ROTC 
are in there trying to capture the 
crown from the Skibos.
Dobson, Rathbun, Reitz and 
Riley are the four shooters who 
helped Tech take the title last 
year, while other members of the 
present aggregation are Callen­
der, Curry, Dietrich, Evans, 
Obringer, Reichenecker, Ritchey, 
M. II. Snyder, W. P. Snyder, Wil­

INTRA MURAL BASKETBALL SHOTSLeads Change; 
New Records 
Set in Bowling
There have been some fine 
scores turned in so far in Intra­
mural bowling. Also the leads 
have changed hands. In league A 
the Delts and the PIKA’s are in 
first place with 11 points won and 
one lost. Second place is held by 
the Betas with 9 won and 3 lost. 
Third goes to the Sigma Nu’s and 
Delta Upsilon, winning 5 and los­
ing 7.
In league B the Tau Delts stand 
first by virtue of 9 points won 
and none lost. Citcom is second 
with 11 and one, Senior Mechan­
icals, third with G and G.
The records held are very high 
and show the high caliber of In­
tramural bowling. The high single 
game honor goes to A1 Gubey 
who rolled a 242. A1 also holds 
the high three game with 538. The 
Delts bowled an 833 to top the 
five-man team totals: A 2214
bowled by the Senior Mechanicals 
ip the high three game match.
Last Saturday the Delts forged 
into first place by taking three 
points from the Betas who prior 
to this time held the top position. 
The Sigma Nu’s moved into second 
place by topping the ATO’s 2 out 
of 3. By talcing 2 out of 3 from 
the DU’s the Kappa Sigs moved 
the DU’s down to third place.
The Citcom Clan relinquished 
the top spot to the Tau Delts. Al­
though the Clan has won 11 and 
lost one, the Tau Delts have a 
perfect score with 9 and 0. The 
Senior Mechanicals held up their 
position by adding three points to 
their total by defeating TX.

For Plaid Staff
All students with abilities as 
writers, typists, or head writers 
are urged to come out and assist 
in editing the Plaid. All copy for 
the paper must be written on Fri­
day evening between the hours of 
nine and twelve.
Evening Student Council activ­
ity points are awarded for all 
work on the Plaid, therefore, this 
is a good way to get sufficient 
points for a key.
If you can write, and haven’t 
the time to come out Friday even­

Technical Boys 
Put Over Surprise 
Decorative Theme
Evening College of Engineering 
closed its dance season in Thistle 
Hall last Saturday evening.
Music for the dance was furn­
ished by Art Sable and his or­
chestra, and the expressions of 
complete satisfaction on the faces 
of the dancers proved that once 
again the committee had chosen 
their band wisely.
Thorough as ever, the Engin­
eers finally came through with 
that “something different in dec­
orations” that we have been hear­
ing so much about. No doubt of 
which college held the dance re­
mained long in the minds of those 
who were there. Every where 
were symbols of the engineering 
profession, slide rules, calculus 
problems, chemistry apparatus, 
drawings, and gears: Thistle Hall 
was converted into a mass of 
modern industrial mechanism. As 
a matter of fact the decorations 
were so realistic that we were 
afraid we had reported to work 
by mistake.
Chaperon duties were capably 
handled by the following invited 
guests. Mr. and Mrs. Kent Shaf­
fer; Mr. and Mrs. McKelway; Dr. 
Warden; Mr. and Mrs. McKee; Dr. 
Jones; and Professor Alemano.
The dance was in charge of the 
officers of Engineering and “Bill” 
Hurtt their social chairman..

You had better get your danc­
ing shoes polished in readiness for 
the Evening College of Fine Art’s 
Dance to be held Saturday, March 
15, in Thistle Hall.
The officers of Fine Arts have 
really opened their pocketbooks 
and secured a B-A-N-D for their 
second dance. They have obtain­
ed the sweet music of Jack Ken­
nedy and his orchestra. This band 
features special number by “The 
Brass Tacks,” “The Five College 
Kids,” Paul Kennedy, and vocals 
by Hal Ross. Topping all is the 
Kay Khoir, a well-developed, 
highly interpretative vocal unit. 
Hal Ross has recently completed 
a series of sustaining programs 
over NBC network.
The Fine Arts’ Dances have 
been noted for their elaborate dec­
orations and abundance of color, 
so you can really expect to see 
Thistle Hall well decorated. Dec­
orations will follow a Saint Pat­
rick’s Day theme and plenty of 
shamrocks, clay pipes, and high 
hats will be seen by those who 
attend the dance.
Painstaking care has been tak­
en to secure new and more beau­
tiful corsages and they have real-,

ED TIEPEL
Council held its annual birth­
day party for George last Sat­
urday and such hilarity you can’t 
imagine, what with Congas and 
songs your mother loved, by Buzz 
Aston (moss was hanging all over 
by the time he got through) and 
droves and droves of men down 
from the hinterlands around Am- 
bridge (they did so wear shoes) 
and gangs of fascinating chaper­
ones stealing Shoff away from his 
girl—well, wow! it was some 
evening.
Ye good old Spanish grandee 
who led you around and around 
in La Conga was none other than 
Nick Roth from way down south 
of the border in Philly. When he 
clicks his teeth like custnnets and 
murmurs “Buenos Noches” (III, 
kid) even dotty old ladies conga 
all over the plnce.
¦ Much too busy to Conga was. 
Ronny Shoff, who Raleighed 
round the chaperones all evening. 
When he wasn’t actually basking 
in the sunshine of their smiles, 
he was whisking cokos up out of 
the basement for them. On the 
whole, lumping the rest of us to­
gether, our manners wouldn’t 
much more than cover the end of 
a chaperone’s knitting needle.
You long dress addicts should 
have been very happy—practical­
ly every tenth girl had on a long, 
floor-sweeping number. In fact, 
we saw one gal in a really short 
dress running around on her 
knees. “Hey,” we yelled, “that’s 
cheating.” But she snarled, “I’m 
just long waisted, that’s all.” So 
we had to let it drop.

Ed Tiepel 
Elected Head 
Of Industries
New President 
Serves Initial 
Year On Council
The Evening College of Indus­
tries have chosen Ed Eiepel to 
represent them , on The Evening 
Student Council. Ed was elected 
as president of that college at 
their election party which was 
held last fall.
Ed is twenty-three years old 
and was born and raised in the 
Pittsbui’gh area. He attended Wil- 
kinsburg High where he followed 
a technical course and majored in 
mathematics. Besides his studies 
he was an active member of the 
gym club. He was graduated from 
WLlkinsburg in 193G.
Coming to Tech in the fall oi 
1937 Ed has been taking a course 
in machine shop practice and ex­
pects to receive a Certificate from 
the Evening College.of Industries 
in the summer of 1942.
A visit to the Tech swimming 
pool every Wednesday will find 
Ed swimming to his heart’s con­
tent. He is also fond of speed 
boating, ice skating, hunting, and 
occasionally enjoys a game of 
sandlot football. He seems to have 
more luck with his swimming and 
'ice skating than his hunting.
Last year Ed was a very active 
member of The Evening College 
of Industries Social Committee, 
and also received his first Evening 
Student Council Activities Insig­
nia for his participation in their 
activités. He was called to the Nu 
Sigma Alpha Activities Honorary 
Fraternity in the summer of 1940 
and has been very active in their 
affairs.
Not satisfied with attending 
school at night, Ed has been tak­
ing a student course at The West- 
inghouse Electric and Manufactur­
ing Company where he has been 
employed since 1936.
Ed attends almost all of our 
Evening School dances with his 
steady, who goes by the name of 
“Virginia.” They both are partial 
to sweet music.

That nite students at the University of Wisconsin are not 
required to take examinations?
What happened to the plaque of Dr. Baker that Evening Stu­
dent Council purchased and dedicated last year?
That nine out of ten students push the door open in the Ad­
ministration building while the tenth pulls it open?
That the bands used on modern cigars were originated by 
the ladies of old Spain who thought it was stylish to smoke but 
were afraid to get the stains on their dainty fingers so they pro­
tected them with fancy colored bands.
That no one is authorized to collect parking fees on school 
property, and that you should report any one attempting to do 
it to the police.
That time is an impossible barrier in the lives of men. Don’t 
waste a moment; every one wasted is one lost and before long 
they add up until we find ourselves buried under a wasted life.
That gentlemen do and say . the kindest things the kindest 
way ?
That experience is what you have left when everything else 
is gone?
That the girl who thinks no man is good enough for her may 
be right—but she is more often left.
That the road to success is open to all, but too many want to 
arrive there without taking the trouble of starting ?
That this would be a good theme for all of us to remember, 
“Never throw mud—whether you hit the mark or miss you al­
ways have dirty hands.”
Remedial Reading Change
Effective yesterday, the course 
in Remedial Reading will be held 
every Monday at 6:30 to 8:30, in­
stead of on Fridays as heretofore.
For those not familier with this 
class, the course is given by Dr.
Robert G. Simpson of the Depart­
ment of Psychology and Educa­
tion, and is for the benefit of any 
student needing, as the name im­
plies, a remedy for reading. In 
other words, Dr. Simpson takes 
each student individually, tries 
to analyze his particular problem, 
and prescribes a course of study
which will enable him to over­
come his difficulties in reading.
The course is free to all night 
school students, and is well worth 
while. Up to the présent time, Dr. 
Simpson has been holding the 
class only once a week, but if 
enough students are interested, he 
will consider having it two nights 
a week.
The location is Room 128-C on 
the second floor of the Adminis­
tration Building. No appointment 
is necessary—just present your­
self anytime between the hours 
of 6:30 to 8:30 for consultation.
IES
11 would take a good many rows 
of telephone poles 
to carry 2400 separate wires.
But pack them all 
into one cable like this 
and one pole line 
can carry the load 
at much lower cost 
and with less danger 
of damage from storm 
and sleet.
Ilevelopments like this 
have helped enormously 
to keep telephone service 
fast and dependable 
and low in cost.c.iall home tonight . . , 
and let us show you!
