An iPhone, Skype, and Google street 
view were all it took for one lucky Carnegie 
Mellon student to catch a group of armed 
robbers. Can Duruk, a senior cognitive 
science and human-computer interaction 
double major, was attacked by two armed 
men just before midnight on Friday night, 
and by 4 a.m. had led the police to the ac­
tors and identified both of them in a po­
lice lineup. Duruk’s story was completely
CMYou.net offers unique, 
customizable apparel, items
made possible by the'technology on his 
iPhone that he found on the Internet.
Dtiruk’s troubles began when turning 
off Fifth Avenue to walk on Amberson 
Avenue toward his off-campus apart­
ment. The two actors were walking 
ahead of him while looking back at him. 
When they saw that Duruk was looking 
forward toward them and that he was 
the only other person within sight, they 
began to slow down, then turned to run 
toward him.
The actors took his wallet from his 
pocket and demanded the PIN for his 
PNC bank card. They then threatened 
him with a small black gun, and pro­
ceeded to take his iPhone. Finally, they 
ran from the scene.
“I checked my pockets. They didn’t 
take my keys so I went home. I couldn’t 
call 911, so I downloaded Skype on my 
computer and called my friend,” Du­
ruk said.
Duruk and the friend he had Skyped 
were able to track the path of the ac­
tors using MobileMe, an online iPhone 
program that syncs the iPhone in addi­
tion to displaying its exact location at any 
time using its internal GPS system.
Duruk and his friend watched as the 
actors traveled throughout the city from 
Shell to Walmart, and eventually to an Eat 
’n Park restaurant in North Versailles. They 
were able to determine that the location 
of the restaurant, for example, was actu­
ally an Eat ’n Park by comparing the map 
displayed by MobileMe with a zoomed-in 
Google street view map of the exact same 
location.
Duruk had been able to track the eco­
nomic happenings of the actors as well, 
using PNC’s online banking system. He 
watched as the actors took out lumps of 
money in succession and attempted to buy 
an Xbox and a baby car seat, among other 
items.
Throughout this tracking period, the 
two had been on the phone with Pitts­
burgh police, updating them on the prog­
ress of the actors. When the actors landed 
at Eat ’n Park, they remained there for a 
sufficient amount of time that the North 
Versailles police were able to go there and 
apprehend the actors. “They caught them 
while they were having dinner,” Duruk 
said.
The police notified Duruk that the actors 
had been caught and asked him to come to 
the station to view a police lineup, where 
he was able to identify both actors.
“I never thought we would actually 
catch them,” Duruk said.
While the link to the other robberies has 
not been investigated, Duruk is expected 
to attend a preliminary hearing for his 
own case next week.
“Just do whatever they tell you. If mon­
ey’s gone, it’s not the end of the world,” 
Duruk said. “But the best advice would be 
to not get yourself into that situation at all. 
Take the Escort or walk with someone.”
As for his feelings on MobileMe, Duruk 
of course has rave reviews. MobileMe was 
the key part of his ability to track down the 
actors.
While Duruk’s robbery was the first 
with such a capture, it was not the first to 
happen lately around the Carnegie Mel­
lon campus. The university has reported a 
series of armed robberies in the past few
weeks, an action that has not been lost 
among the student body.
“I felt less safe after the report that 
someone was robbed at gun point at 9 
a.m.,” said Gabby Moskowitz, a senior eco­
nomics major. “I always walk home late 
at night with other people, but I’ve never 
hesitated to walk to Shadyside alone dur­
ing the day.”
Moskow­
itz hopes 
that the 
stringof 
armed 
robber­
ies will 
soon 
slow.

For anyone involved in a stu­
dent organization, club, or team 
on campus, the members of Al­
pha Kappa Psi Fraternity, the 
professional business fraternity 
on campus, have just done you a 
great service. For the first time, 
students now have access to a 
Carnegie Mellon-based website, 
CMYou.net, which allows them 
to purchase customizable items 
for their various organizations.
Alisa Deychman, a sophomore 
chemistry and economics major 
and a member of Alpha Kappa 
Psi, said, “We offer similar ser­
vices as already popular exist­
ing websites, but we expanded 
those. Now, not only can we of­
fer you rush t’s and Buggy t’s, 
you can also get banners, pens, 
postcards, or any other accesso­
ries you would like to promote 
your organization.”
The website began taking 
shape in fall 2008, when Matt 
Glantz, a senior business major 
and member of Alpha Kappa Psi, 
was contacted by Andy Bern­
stein, the owner of a marketing 
company based in Philadelphia 
called Non-Traditional Media. 
Bernstein had already started 
similar websites at schools like 
Georgetown and the University 
of Pennsylvania, and he wanted 
some help creating a website for 
Carnegie Mellon.
Hannah Gordon/Art Staff
Members of Alpha Kappa Psi 
are committed to helping each 
other in areas of professional de­
velopment like resume writing, 
improving interview skills, and 
hands-on business experience, 
so helping to start this website 
was in direct correlation with 
the mission of the fraternity.
Although there are similar 
websites available, the members 
of Alpha Kappa Psi improved and 
enhanced their site to ensure 
they were offering the best op­
tion to Carnegie Mellon students. 
Non-Traditional Media provides 
a template to every school that 
they work with for the website. 
Alpha Kappa Psi thought, how­
ever, that the template was not 
user-friendly and that it did not 
allow them to offer the same 
features as their competitors. 
They redesigned the template 
by changing some of the layouts, 
creating a logo, and adding the 
design tool.
Kim Chan,’another member 
of Alpha Kappa Psi and a junior 
business major, explained the 
tool. “The design tool allows you 
to pick a T-shirt and then design 
it on the computer. We saw that 
it was a big selling point for Cus- 
tomink.com [a similar website], 
so we used it for CMYou.net.”
There are many benefits, 
besides the ease of using the 
website, for students choosing

Career center helps all majors succeed; H&SS on the rise
STERLING BERLIANT
Staffwriter
For most undergraduate students living 
through the worst economy of their lives, it 
is a scary time to be looking for a job. Fortu­
nately, that’s not the case with Carnegie Mel­
lon students. In May 2009, Carnegie Mellon 
named Robert Murphy as the new director of 
the Career Center, and during his first week 
on the job, the proactive pioneer changed the 
name of his domain from the Career Center 
to the Career and Professional Development 
Center.
“If you become complacent in this econ­
omy, you lose your core,” Murphy said. “The 
career director clearly has to lead innova­
tion.”
The former Marine Corps captain, senior 
executive at PepsiCo. International, and most 
recently director of Career and Leadership 
Development at Hobart and William Smith 
College in Geneva, N.Y. is determined to bet­
ter prepare Carnegie Mellon students to com­
pete for and ultimately win jobs in this tough 
climate when up against students from other 
top-tier institutions.
“Employers are hiring less people. If a com­
pany is only going to hire 10 people, I don’t 
want seven to come from Stanford and three 
to come from here; I want all 10 to come from 
Carnegie Mellon.”
Murphy worked at PepsiCo. International 
running business units^ of 71 million, in­
creased appointments at the Career Center at 
Hobart and William Smith by over 400 per­
cent in his five years there — he personally 
met with 900 students just last year — and 
even climbed Mount Everest.
“You never know what, you're good at until 
you do it,” Murphy said. “If you have the com­
petencies, it doesn't matter what your degree 
is in.”
In just the last month since Murphy has 
come to Carnegie Mellon, he has imple­
mented a multitude of initiatives to help stu­
dents discover what makes them stand out in 
the current job market.
Some of the initiatives Murphy and his 
team are implementing include a Profession­
als In Residence program, which will have re­
cruiters and people in the workplace come in 
to tell students the skills they look for when 
hiring new employees. Murphy is also assign­
ing the role of “employer relations” to some 
of the Career and Professional Development 
Center’s employees’ titles so they can reach 
out to companies that haven’t come to Carn­
egie Mellon in the past, but which students 
are interested in working at.
He knows that representatives from Google, 
Microsoft, and UBS come to Carnegie Mellon 
every year looking for students in their tech 
and finance departments, but he wants to en­
courage students who want to work in other 
fields to start a dialogue as early as possible 
with their career consultants so the employee 
relations team can develop relationships with
companies in other arenas so that every stu­
dent’s needs and interests are met.
Another new implementation is a 3-D port­
folio available on TartanTrak, which allows 
students to type in their interests, leadership 
positions, work experience, and classes that 
they liked the most so employers can see the 
well-rounded nature of a student, not just 
the specialized expertise. Career consultants 
will help students communicate what their 
digital 3-D portfolio highlights about them to 
their potential employers in interviews and 
on resumes.
Maureen May, the assistant director for 
employer development, said, “We want to be 
able to help advance capabilities of students 
to convey to different industries. So many stu­
dents never make an appointment with their 
career consultant and think, ‘I have a degree 
from Carnegie Mellon, a prestigious univer­
sity; companies should hire me.’ Students are 
so surprised if they don't get a second inter­
view when students never meet with us to 
develop their presentation skills.”
R.F. Culbertson, entrepreneurship profes­
sor at the Tepper School of Business, believes 
that, “In a time when there are more people 
than jobs, you need to retrain the students 
how to sell [themselves] so that the students 
from Carnegie Mellon ‘outsell’ the students 
from the Penns, Chicagos, and Stanfords. 
With an oversupply of qualified candidates 
for limited positions... the views toward sales
need to change dramatically.”
Although the average starting salary of 
Tepper students dropped from 2008 to 2009, 
the college of Humanities and Social Sci­
ences was very pleased with how their stu­
dents fared.
“Starting salaries for our students [were] 
the highest in years,” says Debra Ignelzi, as­
sistant director for the Career and Profes­
sional Development Center and consultant 
for the college of Humanities and Social Sci­
ences. “The numbers of appointments went 
up, more students attended our career center 
workshops, and our consultants were able to 
work with our students to develop a plan.” 
Although Carnegie Mellon is often cat­
egorized as a technical school specializing 
in computer science and engineering, many 
H&SS students had starting salaries well over 
$60,000, with some making $75,000, and 
even $100,000.
Ignelzi joked, “Bob [Murphy] always sayS 
we aren’t tooting our horns loud enough.” 
The other assistant director of the Career 
and Professional Development Center and 
consultant for the college of Humanities and 
Social Sciences, Ray Mizgorski, acknowl­
edged, “the skill sets of H&SS students can 
go across a whole breadth of opportunities. 
In this economy, students have realized that 
they shouldn’t be confined to their major be-

Discussing Cuba 
after Fidel Castro
Title: University Lecture Series — 
Great Decisions: Cuba after Castro
The Basics: This Great Decisions lec­
ture is part of the Passport to Global 
Awareness course and will be webcast 
by the World Affairs Council. The lec­
ture will discuss the challenges and 
opportunities in reopening ties with 
Cuba. Since Fidel Castro handed over 
the presidency of Cuba to Raúl Castro 
in early 2008, there have been mixed 
messages of change and keeping the 
status quo in terms of U.S.-Cuban rela­
tions.
The lecture will question whether 
Castro seeks to reopen ties with the 
U.S. and what role Cuban-Amfericans 
will play in shaping a post-Fidel Castro 
Cuba. For more information on Great 
Decisions 2009, please visit the World 
Affairs Council of Pittsburgh website.

Title: University Lecture Series — 
Global Warming: Doing what the planet 
needs in Washington, Copenhagen, 
Pittsburgh, and tropical forests
The Basics: Doug Boucher will dis­
cuss the importance of the next four 
months in terms of taking action on 
global warming around the world.
Washington has the Senate debating 
on the House-passed energy and cli­
mate bill, and negotiations are under­
way in Copenhagen for a new treaty to 
make drastic reductions in greenhouse 
gases.
Boucher believes the G20 meeting 
in Pittsburgh on Sept. 24-25 is key 
for both these events, since it is where 
President Obama and the leaders of the 
world’s largest economies could make a 
commitment to making the' necessary 
investments to avoid the worst conse­
quences of climate change.
Boucher will explain why part of this 
commitment needs to be reducing trop­
ical deforestation, which is responsible 
for about 20 percent of global warming 
pollution.
The presentation will also weigh 
the balance of forces and the political 
dynamics that could lead to historic 
steps on climate change in the next few 
months — or to a failure to act that 
would have drastic consequences for 
the planet. Doug Boucher joined the 
Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) 
in July 2007 as director of its Tropical 
Forests and Climate Initiative.
He is in charge of UCS’s work in 
the United States and in the interna­
tional climate change negotiations on 
tropical deforestation and its role in 
climate change. He is' based in UCS’s 
Washington office.
He has published widely on ecology 
and forest management issues, most re­
cently in Ecology, Science, Plant Ecology, 
Forest Ecology and Management, and 
the Bulletin of the Ecological Society of 
America. Boucher has a Ph.D. in ecol­
ogy and evolutionary biology from 
the University of Michigan and a 
B.A. in ecology and history from Yale 
University.
When: Thursday, Sept. 10, 4:30 p.m.
Where: Breed Hall (Margaret
Morrison Carnegie Hall 103)
Title: World Poverty: Explanations 
and Responsibilities
The Basics: Thomas Pogge, the 
Leitner Professor of Philosophy and 
International Affairs at Yale University, 
will lecture on the ever-widening gap 
between the rich and the poor. He will 
discuss severe poverty in poorer coun­
tries and its connection to about one 
third of all human deaths. Pogge will 
also focus on what role global institu­
tional arrangements, such as the rules 
of the WTO Treaty, play in the per­
sistence of severe poverty, and how 
poverty could affect the responsibility 
of citizens in affluent countries to work 
for its eradication.

H&SS graduates getting 
slight edge over Tepper
CAREER, fromAl
cause they can compete in a lot 
of different arenas.”
“The most neurotic thing in 
the world is to think about what 
your core competencies are,” 
Murphy later asserted. “That’s 
why we have trained our career 
consultants to translate students’ 
interests, values, and skills to 
different professions and work 
with students so they are able 
to clearly articulate to employ­
ers what they want to do. If they 
can’t do that, someone else will 
get the job.”
Culbertson agrees. “The good 
news is that the college student 
bar for sales is set fairly low, so 
learning how to sell yourself and 
competing against people who 
(A) prefer not to sell themselves 
or (B) sell themselves poorly 
could create a competitive ad­
vantage in the eyes of the em­
ployer.”

Business caters to campus
CMYOU, from A1
CMYou.net rather than its com­
petitors like Customink.com and 
Universitytees.com. CMYou.net 
has all of the same features as 
these websites, but offers better 
prices. It also offers a student-to- 
student relationship.
“If you have a question, you 
can easily find us on campus, 
whereas you would haVe to call 
[our competitor’s] l-800num- 
bers and go through all this 
jazz that can be very annoying,” 
Chan said.
The fraternity also has sam­
ples of possible products that 
you can see, pick up, and decide 
if they are right for your organi­
zation.
Norlex Belma, a junior ethics, 
history, and public policy ma­
jor and a member of Alpha Phi 
Alpha Fraternity Incorporated, 
said, “I think this website would
be great for our organization be­
cause it’s reasonably priced and 
it would provide us with more 
than just matching T’s, but also 
matching hoodies and bags.”
Another thing that separates 
CMYou.net from its competitors 
is that if you get a quote from 
the website that doesn’t fit your 
organization’s budget, the com­
pany will see if they can find a 
lower price.
“Andy has a lot of contacts 
with manufacturers, so we can 
work to find a better price if the 
organization cannot afford the 
one that is given,” Glantz said.
Although this is the first busi­
ness the fraternity has helped 
start and promote since its 
founding at Carnegie Mellon in 
2004, they have high hopes for 
future business ventures.
“This is really big for us,” Dey- 
chman said, “and we’re excited 
for the future.”
Univesity aims to increase Greek life despite fraternity removal

With theddition of two so­
rorities to ti Greek quadrangle
— Delta Dca Delta and Kappa 
Kappa Gama — and the re­
moval of tv prominent frater­
nities from: this past summer
— Kappa Elta Rho and Theta 
Xi — the fure of Greek life at 
Carnegie Mlon has been drawn 
into questio
Followinj incidents that oc­
curred lastcademic year that, 
according tche Office of Student 
Life, violateuniversity protocol, 
Kappa Deltiho was removed by 
the Universe Disciplinary Com­
mittee.
G. Richd Tucker, Interim 
Dean of Stient Affairs at the 
time of his Ny 29 letter to Kappa 
Delta Rho e>laining the univer­
sity’s decisit, listed the official 
reasons forhe fraternity’s sus­
pension as furnishing alcohol 
to minors” ad “failing to comply 
with univeny sanctions.”
“We’re tl people that are 
‘quote-unqite’ making the deci­
sions,” explned Monica Bebie, 
coordinators fraternity and so­
rority life, tThe Tartan, “but it 
wasn’t any ccisions I made, but 
rather dedans the fraternities 
made.”
Several nmbers of the fra­
ternities reeved from campus 
expressed filings that the uni­
versity is m/ing toward an un­
spoken polk of favoring sorori­
ties over frarnities.
Bob Sari: however, the most 
recent preslent of Theta Xi, 
clarified Thta Xi’s position on 
the matter.
“I wouldiay that we were 
[treated fair while on campus]. 
I do think th< the original charge 
[that] got thball rolling on our 
probation - an accusation of 
furnishing aohol to minors — 
was not hadled perfectly, but 
overall, I thi.c we [were] treated 
like any oth< fraternity on cam­

Theta Xi, nlike Kappa Delta 
Rho, was reoved based on a de­
cision made y its national orga­

ciation to the Carnegie Mellon 
Theta Xi ,Pi Alumni group, Dean 
of Student Affairs Karen Boyd 
explained that the chapter had 
been placed in “dormant status.” 
That is, “the charter is inactive 
for an indefinite period” based 
on “an investigation of a serious 
violation of fraternity standards 
conducted earlier [in July] by 
representatives of the National 
Office of the Fraternity.”
Additionally, Boyd’s e-mail 
encouraged Theta Xi alumni to 
connect with the national frater­
nity “in support of the potential 
reactivation of the charter in the 
future” — encouraging, at least 
in theory, the fraternity’s future 
growth on campus.
According to Hippensteel and 
Bebie, the Office of Student Life 
is not trying to kick fraternity life 
off campus. In fact, it is doing the 
opposite.
“I started here five years ago,” 
Bebie explained, “and Greek life 
was 14 percent of the campus, 
and now it’s 21 percent of the 
campus. The IFC [Interfraternity 
Council] is already opening the 
doors for some national organi­
zations.”
Hippensteel stressed the dif­
ficulty of making such a decision 
to remove a fraternity, such as in 
the case of Kappa Delta Rho. “It’s 
very sad to lose an organization. 
It’s hard to see an organization 
that was there not be there any­
more,” she said.
The campus community may 
think the fraternities are being 
judged too harshly by the univer­
sity, as several brothers of both 
current and former on-campus 
organizations questioned. “We 
hold them to a higher standard 
because they’ve chosen to hold 
themselves to a higher standard,” 
Hippensteel said.
From the perspective of Stu­
dent Affairs, the decision to re­
move Kappa Delta Rho followed 
this pattern of heightened ideals 
and often self-imposed pressures 
to contribute to the campus com­
munity. However, this doesn’t 
always mean a fraternity’s mem­
bers’ actions will follow suit.
“We can say what the' expecta­
tions are, but in the end, people 
make choices, and there will 
be consequences for choices —
sometimes they’re good, but 
sometimes they’re not,” Hippen­
steel added.
“They’re an organization; 
they’re not individual students,” 
Hippensteel told The Tartan. 
However, according to a letter 
sent to Kappa Delta Rho by the 
university, the majority of the al­
legations against the fraternity 
were based upon individuals’ ac­
tions, often unrelated to events 
or activities sponsored by Kappa 
Delta Rho.
While several Greek organiza­
tions’ members were under the 
impression that the fraternity 
would again be on campus in 
two years, Bebie explained oth­
erwise.
“Kappa Delta Rho is as eligible 
to return to campus as are the 75 
other nationwide Greek organi­
zations being considered,” she 
said.
The university is looking for, 
she added, “the strongest -and 
best: they [should] have a strong 
alumni network, the largest foun­
dations and endowments, a large 
structure in place for support, 
strong leadership programming, 
and lots of chapters nationally.” 
If Kappa Delta Rho qualifies as 
a fraternity fitting these quali­
fications, it will be considered 
“through an IFC process for ex­
pansion,” along with many other 
Greek organizations.
The sisters of Delta Delta Delta 
have since moved into Kappa 
Delta Rho’s former house. Me­
gan Sasinoski, the membership 
development chairman of the so­
rority, expressed her sisterhood’s 
gratitude in an Aug. 19 e-mail to 
The Tartan.
“While Tri Delta is very excited 
to have moved onto the Greek 
Quad, we are sad to see a chapter 
leave. We feel especially fortu­
nate and grateful for the oppor­
tunity to live in a larger facility 
that will help promote our chap­
ter’s growth.... Tri Delta is really 
looking forward to being a part 
of the larger sorority community 
on the quad.”
The president of Kappa Kappa 
Gamma did not respond for com­
ment to The Tartan.
“Our organization was ap­
proached and asked if we were 
interested in replacing one of the
houses on the Greek quadrangle,” 
said Chris Niessl, IFC Vice Presi­
dent of Community Relations 
and a member of the Sigma Tau 
Gamma fraternity in an August 
21 e-mail to The Tartan. “How­
ever, I know we declined.”
Bebie and Hippensteel, how­
ever, insisted that other fraterni­
ties were not considered. Rather, 
a process from four years ago to 
decide the order of moving or­
ganizations onto the quadrangle 
was consulted.
However, they would not dis­
cuss the specifics of this process 
or of the exact reasons for choos­
ing Delta Delta Delta and Kappa 
Kappa Gamma.
Lizzy Young, the president of 
the Panhellenic Council, simply 
stated that the recommendation 
to move Delta Delta Delta onto 
the quadrangle was made based 
on a decision made in the spring 
of 2007, according to an Aug. 14 
e-mail to the leaders of Greek or­
ganizations.
Regardless of the specifics of 
the decision process by which 
these two sororities were cho­
sen, it is clear that the university 
is looking to reduce the potential 
opportunity for underage alco­
hol incidents and any associated 
liabilities on the quadrangle.
Kappa Delta Rho, if chosen to 
move back onto campus in the 
future, was recommended by 
Tucker to “return as an alcohol- 
free organization.” Moreover, 
Hippensteel and Bebie acknowl­
edged the rule (which exists at a 
national level) that disallows so­
rorities from providing alcohol. 
“Sororities are farther along and 
more responsible,” Bebie said. 
Some of these organizations have
100,000 to 300,000 members 
internationally, and “insurance 
premiums go [up] with alcohol.”
Saris, Theta Xi’s president, 
echoed this rationale. “Overall I 
think there will be a grand shift 
from fraternity life as we know 
it.... We felt that it was a privilege 
to have social events where peo­
ple could come, meet us, meet 
others.... I think that because of 
legal implications against our 
fraternity and the university, this 
has become too big of a risk and 
thus this aspect of [Greek life] is 
on its way out.”
H&SS Connect: Live promotes college pride
DOMINIQUE DAVIS
Junior Staffwriter
On Friday, Aug. 28, Rangos 
Ballroom was the site of a social 
mixer called H&SS Connect: Live, 
bringing the students in Carnegie 
Mellon’s College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences together for 
a night of giveaways, free food, 
and DJ YS on the Is and 2s.
Unlike other colleges on cam­
pus, H&SS students have a wide 
range of specialties and career 
goals, so it is difficult for students 
of different majors, although 
within the same college, to meet 
each other. Most of the time, 
H&SS students are only able to 
bond with students who have the 
same or a similar major.
Nicole Ifill, a sophomore infor­
mation systems major, identified 
this lack of connection as a seri­
ous problem within the college 
and decided to do something 
about it. Ifill said, “We’re very 
diverse. We needed a unifying 
event. We wanted to do some­
thing like this last semester, but 
everyone’s schedule was too hec­
tic.”
Ifill did not let that stop her 
from fulfilling this need. She de­
cided to spend her summer plan­
ning an event for the fall. She ap­
proached other H&SS students to 
help with the event, created a Fa- 
cebook group to promote it, and
did most of her planning over the 
phone and by e-mail to ensure it 
would be a success.
“I’m pretty proud because we 
didn’t have much time and it still 
turned out great,” Ifill said. “We 
want to instill H&SS pride and 
create a community amongst stu­
dents of different majors.”
And according to many of the 
students who attended, it was 
a success. Aurelia Henderson, a 
first-year creative writing major, 
was among the students who at­
tended.
“It’s nice meeting a diverse 
group of people,” Henderson 
said, “people who are multi-cul­
tural and multi-faceted. It makes 
me happy to know that I’m part of 
a community that is so passionate^ 
about so many different things.” 
Yulin Kuang, a sophomore cre­
ative writing and global politics 
major said, “I got to meet a lot 
of the [first-years], which is nice 
because it’s always nice to bond 
with new people.”
Ifill approached Gloria Hill, the 
assistant dean and director of the 
Academic Advisory Center, and 
Renee Camerlengo, the associ­
ate dean of student affairs, at the 
end of the spring semester and 
pitched the idea.
She told them that she felt a di­
vide within the college and that 
she had thought of a way to begin 
closing it.
Hill was more than willing to 
offer her support.
“I was very, very excited when 
Nicole came to us,” Hill said. “We 
are working hard to build a com­
munity within the college. We 
want H&SS students to feel great 
about being here.”
Hill also said that they hope 
to have two similar events per 
semester to ensure that they sus­
tain the community that they 
have begun to build.
They even provided a sug­
gestion box to allow students to 
share their ideas about what the 
next event should be. This may 
be the first mixer of this kind for 
H&SS, but Ifill and Hill insist it is 
not the last.
Whether they be one of the 
people who thought of, planned, 
and presented H&SS Connect, 
or one of the students who was 
bonding with people they may 
have never met, all participants 
can sense the excitement every­
one feels about this new venture.
Crystal Wray, a sophomore eco­
nomics and Chinese major said, “I 
think it’s great that they’re doing 
this because H&SS is such a di­
verse [college]. We really needed 
something like this to bring all of 
our interests together.”

WHO reports more 
severe swine flu
The World Health Organiza­
tion declared that a new severe 
form of swine flu is infecting 
healthy, young people and is 
attacking the lungs directly. 
Several countries are reporting 
that nearly 15 percent of the pa­
tients affected by swine flu need 
intensive care.
This new form of the H1N1 
virus is far more severe than the 
seasonal influenza virus and 
can cause respiratory failure. 
Unlike previous cases, young 
and healthy people are get­
ting infected by this virus and 
require extra, specialized care 
that can prove to be very expen­
sive. WHO is warning countries 
in the northern hemisphere to 
be prepared for a second round 
of the pandemic and it also be­
lieves that the number of swine 
flu cases in tropical countries 
will soon increase.

Imaging exposes 
many to radiation
According to a study pub­
lished in the New England Jour­
nal of Medicine, at least four mil­
lion Americans below 65 years 
of age are exposed to high levels 
of radiation because of medical 
imaging tests each year. Around 
400,000 of these patients re­
ceive doses of radiation that are 
higher than the permitted raV 
diation levels for nuclear power 
plant workers or others working 
with radioactive materials.
Such imaging tests are gen­
erally prescribed by doctors to 
check for the accumulation of 
plaque in the blood and to check 
how well the heart pumps blood. 
The Department of Health and 
Human Services has estimated 
that the number of patients un­
dergoing CT scans has increased 
four times over the period of 
10 years from 1995 to 2005. In 
light of these new findings, doc­
tors believe that soon there will 
be many more cases of cancer in 
the country.

West Nile virus 
migrates to Europe
Scientists have discovered 
the harmful West Nile virus for 
the first time in mosquitoes in 
Switzerland. Aedes japonicus 
has colonized an area of 540 
square miles in central Switzer­
land. The mosquito was previ­
ously found in Japan, Korea, 
China, North America, France, 
and Belgium. However, this is 
the first time that the mosquito 
has been found in Switzerland.
The mosquito is capable of 
transmitting Japanese enceph­
alitis and the West Nile virus, 
both of which can cause serious 
harm to humans and are poten­
tially fatal. Last year, the West 
Nile virus killed 44 people in 
the United States alone.

H1N1 deaths 
highest in Brazil
A total of 557 people have 
died because of swine flu in Bra­
zil. This is the highest number 
of deaths recorded anywhere in 
the world. Nearly 1800 people 
have died across the world be­
cause of the disease and 522 
have died in the United States.
As of now, Brazil, Argentina, 
Chile, Mexico, and the United 
States have the most cases of 
swine flu. Argentina has the 
highest swine flu mortality rate 
— which is calculated by con­
sidering the total population of 
the country and the number of 
deaths — while Brazil has the 
seventh highest and the United 
States the 13th highest.

New research helps simulate reality sdTechBriefs
EDMUND HUBER
Staffwriter
Simulating the physical world 
as we understand it, accurately, 
is the key to everything from 
games and movies to experi­
ments.
“If you look at a Pixar movie, 
you’ll see that all the characters 
have simulated clothes and flow­
ing hair,” said Adrien Treuille, 
asssistant professor in the com- 
. puter science department, “but 
video games are totally different 
and have a much simpler world.”
The complexity of the physical 
simulations needed to make con­
vincing hair, fur, and liquids re­
quire large “farms” of specialized 
computers and large amounts 
of time to render. Treuille’s re­
search focus has been in making 
convincing physical simulations 
possible, in real time, on laptops 
and other commodity devices.
For example, the traditional 
approach to cloth simulation 
views the cloth as a number of 
particles connected by springs. 
Physically accurate simulation 
with this method, however, re­
quires seconds or minutes to cal­
culate per frame.
“Basically, even with very fast 
algorithms, it’s hard to update a 
large number of variables in real 
time. We need ways to represent 
physical systems using far fewer 
variables,” Treuille said.
The work in physical simula­
tion by Treuille and his students 
attempts to boil down the prob­
lem to a smaller, more manage­
able number of variables that 
describe the essence of the phe­
nomenon.
“Using huge numbers of vari­
ables to simulate physical sys­
tems is a little naive, because this 
enables an enormous number of 
configurations that we’ll never 
see that don’t actually happen in 
a typical day,” Treuille said.
In the case of cloth simulation, 
“a few number of variables, each 
of which is a representation of the 
global state, could represent the 
folds that you would typically ex­
pect to see,” Treuille explained. 
Treuille’s research group has 
applied this so-called “reduced 
basis” method to the problem of 
simulating fluid flow.
“In computer graphics, fluid 
is a relatively new field in the 
scheme of things,” said Matthew 
Stanton, a Ph.D. student under
Treuille. “The prblem is that the 
techniques are ow — even in 
a relatively sm«l three-dimen­
sional domain, takes minutes 
per frame to siiulate,” Stanton 
said.
The goal is tonake fluid flow 
simulation respcsive in real time 
so that it can based in interac­
tive contexts, sth as games. In 
a paper publishd in SIGGRAPH 
2009, a high-pifile conference 
for computer giphics research, 
the group presated a method 
for linking seveil reduced basis 
simulations sp.ially. This al­
lowed the grouifor example, to 
simulate airflovthrough a city- 
scape in real tiie. The airflow 
around individul buildings was 
characterized findependently, 
and the resulting piecewise sim­
ulations were sltched together 
on a city grid.
Treuille’s invest in simulat­
ing physical pheomena has also 
helped spark th Foldlt {http:// 
fold.it) project, game and com­
petitive commuity for the prob­
lem of protein ïucture predic­
tion.
As a protein is>eing created in 
a cell, it begins s a long string 
of building blocs called amino
acids — the sequence of amino 
acids of a protein is called its 
primary structure. In this state, 
the protein is not useful, and so 
it either folds on itself naturally 
or is folded by another protein 
into its functional configuration. 
The problem of protein structure 
prediction is deciding how a pro­
tein will fold, knowing only its 
primary structure.
Computer algorithms for de­
ciding protein folding are a hot 
topic in computational- biology, 
because understanding how pro­
teins fold can help to understand 
how to design proteins for spe­
cific problems.
In the Foldlt game, the player 
is given a protein in a partially 
unfolded state. The goal is then 
to get higher scores by folding the 
protein into a more and more sta­
ble state. “These are experiments 
to see how well human intuition 
helps players to find new shapes 
where computers fail,” Treuille 
said. Treuille hinted that they 
have had positive results in com­
paring human-folded proteins to 
computer-folded proteins, which 
will be revealed in an upcoming

When watching performers 
walk over burning coals, put 
sticks of fire down their throats, 
or even pelt out a jet of fire from 
their mouths, it is hard not to 
squirm in sympathetic pain. 
But, unlike you, the perform­
ers usually finish their act with 
a smile on their face and show 
no semblance of the pain that 
they ought to have felt. How do 
these people manage to do their
acts? Although all these acts are 
extremely dangerous, there are 
special techniques that the art­
ists employ to minimize the dan­
ger. Playing around with simple 
scientific concepts helps these 
artists do what is almost un­
thinkable: play with fire.
The technique employed by 
the firewalkers is vested in the 
theories of conduction of heat 
and insulation. Fire-walkers ac­
tually never walked on flames, 
but rather walk on burning coals. 
An article in National Geographic
News explains th? heat is trans­
ferred to the feet <f the walker by 
the process of hat conduction. 
When the coals htve been burn­
ing for quite sometime, they are 
reduced to mosty pure, light­
weight carbon. Sich carbon is 
an extremely poa conductor of 
heat and would t&e a long time 
to transfer heat.
The fire-walkei never stands 
on the coals for along period of 
time; the walker usually walks 
quickly over the oals and each 
foot remains touoiing the coals
for hardly a second. Such a short 
period of time is not sufficient for 
a large amount of heat to transfer 
and the walker’s feet do not get 
burned.
The second aspect that makes 
this technique possible is the fact 
that the coals are covered with a 
layer of ash. Ash is basically an 
insulator and further hampers 
the transfer of heat to the feet of 
the artist.
The result is that the artists

Nostrils compete to 
process scents
Researchers conducted a 
study that resulted in new in­
formation on how the brain pro­
cesses scents. In the study, vol­
unteers simultaneously sampled 
smells from two bottles with dif­
ferent odors, one through each 
nostril. Researchers found that 
the brain processed the smells 
in an alternating fashion, with 
participants switching between 
perceiving each of the scents. 
Rather than smelling a mixture 
of the two smells, the smells 
alternate in a binary rivalry. 
Understanding this perception, 
called an “olfactory illusion,” 
might help cure olfactory disor­
ders, particularly those affect­
ing the elderly.

Wikipedia adds 
editorial review
Within weeks, Wikipedia will 
impose editorial review on ar­
ticles about living people before 
any changes become public. Ed­
its to pages about living people 
will become “flagged revisions,” 
which will be invisible to visi­
tors until an experienced volun­
teer approves of any changes. 
Those at the Wikimedia Foun­
dation, the nonprofit that gov­
erns" Wikipedia, hope that this 
will make Wikipedia more de­
pendable given its large size 
and influence.
The system is particularly im­
portant for pages about living 
people because inaccurate in­
formation can be very harmful. 
Some pages are already “pro­
tected” or “semi-protected,” 
including articles on Britney 
Spears and President Obama, 
limiting editing capabili­
ties to only certain Wikipedia

Scientists explain 
decline in bees
Honey bee colonies may be 
declining due to damage in 
their internal production of 
proteins. Bees make proteins 
using ribosomes, and a study 
of sick bees found fragments of. 
ribosomal RNA in the bees’ gut. 
These bees suffered infections 
that attack the ribosome, pre­
venting bees from responding 
to life-threatening problems, 
such as pesticides and inad­
equate nutrition.
Additionally, a virus that 
damages the ribosomes is car­
ried by Varroa mites, which 
were accidentally introduced 
in the U.S. in 1986. This virus 
might contribute to ribosome 
breakdown among bees.

More mosquitoes 
may reduce disease
Researchers found that a less 
dense mosquito population re­
sults in bigger mosquitoes that 
pose more of a risk of spreading 
disease. An experiment where 
density of Aedes vigilax mos­
quitoes was reduced by a factor 
of 10 resulted in female adults 
increasing in size by 8 percent, 
living 48 percent longer, and 
laying 67 percent more eggs.
This finding is likely a result 
of less competition for food, 
resulting in the ability to be.- 
come bigger. The mosquitoes’ 
increased lifespan is a cause 
for concern because the longer 
a(mosquito lives, the further it 
can fly and the more easily it 
can spread disease. This new 
information on mosquitoes 
suggests that mosquito control 
programs should focus on areas 
with low density of mosquitoes 
in addition to those areas with 
high mosquito density.

Before aliens, mutants, and ro­
botic killing machines took over 
the world of fictional monsters, 
characters like Frankenstein and 
werewolves ruled fiction. Many 
people have heard of werewolves
— one of the most famous being 
Harry Potter’s Professor Lupin — 
people who turn into wolf-like 
creatures when there is a full 
moon.
Although the werewolf is a 
myth, there is a disease called 
hypertrichosis, popularly called 
the werewolf syndrome, that is a 
rare inherited illness.
Hypertrichosis actually de­
scribes excessive hair growth in 
abnormal places on the body. An 
article in the Dermatology Online 
Journal describes that in normal 
humans, hair differentiates into 
lanugo, vellus, and terminal hair. 
Lanugo hair grows and sheds 
during fetal development and 
vellus hair immediately replaces 
it. Vellus hair is short, soft, and 
light and is seen over the face 
and arms of children. Terminal 
hair is longer and coarser and is 
found on the scalp, eyebrows, and 
eyelashes. This type of hair com­
prises the hair pattern formed in 
puberty and adulthood.
The diagnosis of hypertricho­
sis is made based on hair pattern, 
analysis of hair type by histol­
ogy, and genetics. Additionally,
hypertrichosis is not caused by a 
disturbance in the amount of an­
drogens the body secretes; hence 
a presence of excessive hair 
growth but normal androgen se­
cretion may be an indication of 
hypertrichosis.
In hypertrichosis, the patient’s 
entire body is typically covered 
with light-colored hair that is 
most prominent on the shoul­
ders, face, and ears. Hair length 
can reach up to a few centime­
ters.
Other physical anomalies can 
include a dismorphic triangular 
coarse face, or a long nose with 
a round tip. From genetic analy­
sis of this disease, it seems that 
mutations of chromosome 8 are 
associated with hypertrichosis. 
However the true cause and ge­
netic background of this disease 
are yet to be discovered.
As stated on Hypertrichosis, 
com, a person with congenital 
hypertrichosis lanuginosa will 
show, shortly after birth, prenatal 
lanugo hairs (which are usually 
shed before birth) over the entire 
body except the palms, soles, and 
the mucous membranes. This 
is one type of the disease and is 
especially rare. Yet, as stated on 
the Dermatology Online Journal, 
this was the disease that Jo-Jo 
the Dog-Faced Boy had. The first 
recorded case of hypertrichosis, 
however, is believed to be that of 
Petrus Gonzales in 1556. He was 
taken to France initially as a gift
for the nobleand was educated 
once they reezed he was quite 
intelligent. Hsubsequently had 
offspring witlsimilar werewolf- 
syndrome fttures and this 
kindred was ter known as the 
family of Arrras because their 
family portrts were discov­
ered in Ambr; castle, located in 
modern-day ¿stria.
Other typeof the disease in­
clude hypertchosis with gin­
gival fibromjosis, where hair 
appears oveithe face, trunk, 
and eyebrowduring childhood 
followed by gigival hyperplasia 
(overgrowth < the gum tissues). 
Naveoid hyperichosis is an un­
usual case olhypertrichosis in 
that there is oly one area where 
hair growth ccurs.
This diseascan occur at birth 
or even later l life and is char­
acterized by airy tufted ears, 
tails, or exceave beard growth 
in males and:emales with the 
illness.
Although t2re is the initial 
shock of havig a child who is 
covered in ha-, these children 
are able to live long life and are 
able to procre;e.
Some patiits do develop 
other anomaes like dental 
problems, yetbecause this dis­
ease is so ran with only 50 re­
ported cases i the world since 
the Middle Ags, there could be 
other completions that have

Treuille and his group have simulated a number of phenomena, including protein folding in real time. Above is 
a screen shot of Foldlt, a protein-folding program.
SIMULATION, fromA4
Nature article.
With the successes of Foldlt in 
hand, Treuille’s group has been 
designing and implementing 
a game called Evolvelt. In this 
game, the player designs an or­
ganism from the same building 
blocks used by RNA molecules. 
“RNA is believed to be the first, 
and simplest, form of life,” 
Treuille said. In an initial study,
the players will be tasked with 
creating stable RNA molecules of 
various shapes. “We are trying to 
find the possible range of shapes 
for RNA structures,” said Jee- 
hyung Lee, a student in Treuille’s 
group who is spearheading the 
project. Lee explained the kinds 
of RNA structures they want to 
make, saying, “Can this RNA 
be folded into a knot? And does 
it hold its shape when we shake 
it?” The best creatures, or RNA
molecules, will be synthesized 
by the group’s partner lab.
In a further phase, the game 
will be expanded by allowing 
players to complete with one an­
other. By designing and dueling 
their creatures, players will par­
ticipate in a form of evolution, 
where the strongest creatures 
thrive and the weakest creatures 
are not reproduced. “Hopefully 
we can bring to life ancient path­
ways,” Treuille said.
Performances involving fire rely heavily on simple science

are able to walk across the coals 
quickly, without burning their 
feet.
According to this theory, artists 
should not be able to walk across 
hot metal as metal is a good con­
ductor of heat and would cause 
the artists’ feet to burn. The Na­
tional Geographic News article 
puts forth another theory to ex­
plain this art. As stated in the ar­
ticle, members of the Firewalking 
Institute of Research and Educa­
tion in Twain Harte, Calif, were 
able to walk across a hot metal 
grill without burning them­
selves. The previously described 
theory of coal and ash has no way 
to explain this feat. Tolly Burkan, 
founder of the institute, believes 
that the ability has to do with the 
artist’s frame of mind. In the arti­
cle, Burkan compared the ability 
to the way an egg boils in a paper 
cup kept on hot coals.
Although the hot coals should 
cause the paper to burn, it doesn’t. 
This is because the boiling water 
is at 100°C and the paper stays at 
this temperature, not burning. 
Similarly, if the artist’s feet have 
a gqod amount of blood supply, 
the blood flow prevents the flesh 
from burning.
Burkan beeves that with a 
relaxed mincbt, the artists can 
achieve this large amount of 
blood flow anmot get burned.
Fire eating nd fire breathing 
are much haier than walking 
on “fire.”
These featsusually do harm 
the artist andrequire the artist 
to develop soie amount of pain 
tolerance. Hcvever, the basic 
techniques art based on physics 
and chemistry 
Artists who breathe” fire basi­
cally shoot a jc of fuel from their 
mouths onto source of flame in 
their hands. Tie fuel ignites on 
contact with le flame and the
spectators get to see ball or jet 
of fire. However, fire breathing 
acts have gone terribly wrong 
when done by amateur artists, 
or even well-trained artists who 
have had poor judgment. This 
is because the exact force with 
which the artist sprays the fuel 
and the angle at which the spray 
is directed have to be precisely 
calculated. If the angle is too 
high, the fuel can fall back onto 
the performer’s face. If the angle 
is too low, the ignited fuel can 
fall to the ground, causing a fire 
at the performer’s feet. Another 
factor that artists have to keep in 
mind is the type of fuel they use.
Many fuels are carcinogenic, so 
the artists have to try and find 
a safe fuel that causes them the 
least amount of harm.
Along with this, the artists 
have to keep in mind that the fuel 
should not create a fire so large 
that it is hard to control. House- 
ofpoi.com explains that knowing 
the flash point of the fuel being 
used is extremely important. 
Flash points are assigned to all 
flammable liquids and indicate 
the lowest temperature at which 
that liquid can ignite in air.
The lower the flash point, the 
more easily the liquid can burst 
into flames. Fire breathers, con­
sequently, have to choose liquids 
that have a high flash point. Us­
ing low flash point liquids like 
gasoline or alcohol could cause 
dangerous explosions.
In spite of these precautions, a 
fire breather’s health is severely 
compromised and may get mouth 
and gum cancer, stomach ulcers, 
burns on the mouth and gums, 
and headaches.
Even fire-walkers may get se­
verely burned if they do not per­
form their acts carefully. There is 
a large amount of risk involved 
in all of these techniques, and if 
not done properly, they may lead 
to death.

People, not precautions, overreact to H1N1
The swine flu: we’ve all heard of it, 
we’ve been warned coundess times about 
its possible health risks via numerous e- 
mails, and we’ve seen our school make 
the front page of local papers because of 
it. But is the situation really as desperate 
as it’s being made out to be?
College campuses are notorious for 
being the perfect places to spread dis­
eases. You see the same people day af­
ter day, week after week, and are living 
and studying in close contact with them. 
When one student gets sick, it is easy to 
see how illness would spread quickly 
from person to person to person.
When cold and flu season hits ev­
ery year, it is not surprising to see mul­
tiple students in the same class walking 
around with Kleenex boxes or a group of 
friends huddled around a library table all 
sniffling at the same time.
Instead of keeping this fact in mind and 
merely looking at H1N1 as an example of 
this common phenomenon, people are 
looking at the sickness with a panicked, 
mob mentality — they can think of noth­
ing else other than the fact that more and 
more people are being infected, and their 
minds are quickly jumping to think how 
much higher that number could be in a 
few days.
Instead of looking at H1N1 as another 
strain of the flu — there are thousands 
of them — people are looking at it like
some new disease with scary potentia
While people may be overreacting ¿it 
about H1N1, it is still good to take ¡re- 
cautions to avoid spreading the illnss, 
and we appreciate the university’s effrts 
to do so.
It is clear we at Carnegie Mellon hve 
a more pressing problem than am of 
the other local universities, since >ur 
reported cases are much higher in nm- 
ber, and we believe that the universe is 
doing what it believes necessary to :op 
the spread of the disease to any rore 
students. By taking precautions likeso- 
lating infected students, the likelihod of 
slowing the spread of the disease is mch 
greater.
CulinArt brings change, specials to campus dinin
Carnegie Mellon has a new dining 
vendor, and with that new vendor comes 
better food and additional services to 
keep the community interested in dining 
and eating at the various new locations 
on campus.
According to a recent e-mail newslet­
ter from Dining Services, Carnegie Mel­
lon was ranked in the bottom 10 schools 
for food by the Princeton Review. Dining 
Services is taking steps to change that, 
however, by introducing new eating op­
tions on campus.
Even more important than the taste of 
the food served (which is superior to the 
old food, at least for now) is the new vari­
ety of eating locations on campus. Before, 
it seemed as if there were only different 
sandwich shops, but now, there are many 
more options: freshly tossed salads, com-
fort foods, a fresh juice bar, and places to 
eat steak and burgers on campus, as well 
as plans for an all-day breakfast location 
and an ice cream shop, which will serve 
up classics like milkshakes and malts. 
Even locations similar to old eateries 
have improved, adding higher quality in­
gredients and more options.
Aside from this, CulinArt and Dining 
Services have taken extra steps to keep 
the campus interested. They have intro­
duced specials, where items are offered 
at a free or reduced charge at certain 
locations, as well as both breakfast and 
coffee clubs, which reward customers 
with a free item after the purchase of 10. 
These things take away the monotony of 
on-campus eating by introducing reasons 
to go to different locations, and also rea­
sons to stay on campus. (Why bother go-
ing to Starbucks for your coffee if yoitan 
go to Maggie Murph and get the sme 
coffee with a promise of a free drink ¿ter 
10 cups?)
CulinArt also has a Twitter accant 
for students to follow to keep up mh 
any dining news, changes in hours, nd 
specials. While it is unclear how usful 
this will be, it is good that the compay is 
trying to connect with students and kep 
them informed about dining on camps. 
CulinArt has also begun offering -ee 
hand sanitizer to its customers in sevral 
locations, showing that despite a cleafo- 
cus on food, they still care about the vell- 
being of the campus community.
CulinArt is receptive to suggestins, 
and with input from students, we ttnk 
that dining will continue to improve in 
both small and significant ways.
People should be allowed to voice concerns freel)
Last week, the Dean of the School of 
Computer Science, Randy Bryant, sent 
out an e-mail to the School of Computer 
Science to “give us a review of some basic 
etiquette” in regards to the newly con­
structed Gates Center.
Bryant writes, “I am getting a lot . of 
reports from people who are dismayed 
when they hear a litany of complaints or 
a lack of enthusiasm” when„asked about 
their thoughts on the new building. His 
response, in short, is not to deal with 
these two problems by trying to solve 
them, but rather suggesting the commu­
nity walk around parroting phrases to 
mask the problems’ existence.
Why not instead address that many of 
the complaints stem from a move into 
the building before it was finished, and 
explain the reasons behind that move? 
Rather than expecting enthusiasm from 
the community, the e-mail should have
looked for reasons for the lack of excite­
ment.
You might ask, But what if I am truly 
not enthusiastic about the new com­
plex? The e-mail makes it seem like that 
doesn’t matter; that as a Carnegie Mellon 
University community member, you are 
not currently in a place to voice your own 
thoughts. The message even went so far 
as to give suggested quotes that would 
be suitable for upper administration and 
visiting guests, such as, “Just try saying 
,‘Thanks for all your hard work.’”
This is the heart of this message — “his 
tips,” which recommend: If you are asked 
about the new Gates Hillman Complex, 
don’t explain what is wrong with it, don’t 
be silent, speak only with complete grati­
tude, thanks, and praise.
We believe the Carnegie Mellon stu­
dent, faculty member, or staff member 
who wants to be told how to say, think,
and act is rare.
This e-mail was an assault on ourin- 
telligence; it was condescending, an it 
advocated limiting speech and lying to 
President Cohon.
While we are sure that many peole 
around this campus could say thank pu 
more, and could be more polite and mre 
grateful for the hard work that obviouly 
went into the construction of the Gaes 
Hillman Complex, this message was ,ot 
written with a balanced suggestionof 
tempering our complaints with thank:
It was not written to moderate Can- 
egie Mellon’s critical thinking and cyri- 
cism with gratitude. It was created to 
silence all concerns with the new Gaes 
Hillman Complex, and instead, it males 
them seem even more severe and d- 
ditionally creates new concerns wth 
regard to the message coming from tie 
school’s leadership.
Viewers should rethink 
opinions about Jon & Kate

ALEX YUSCHIK
Being at home for the summer and 
without the rigor of constant schoolwork 
putting a damper on recreational activi­
ties, it seems almost inevitable that real­
ity TV would crop into the summer holi­
days. Sure enough, Survivor is back with 
yet another new immunity challenge, the 
Bachelor and Bachelorette need to choose 
their summer sweethearts, and Jon and 
Kate have separated.
Woah, hold on there.
Okay, so reality TV might not be the 
most exciting thing in the world, but 
when you’re stuck without thought- 
provoking, 10-page essays or massive 
problem sets, watching someone else 
raise a bunch of cute kids starts to look 
pretty appealing. The series seemed to 
have a good purpose behind it: The par­
ents allow their lives and their children’s 
early lives to be filmed in exchange for 
money. Which, when you consider that 
there’s eight kids to put through school, 
let alone college (Guess what the tuition 
for eight kids will be 10 or so years down 
the road? Try a cool two million bucks), 
doesn’t seem like such a horrible thing.
Granted, Jon and Kate want the best 
for their kids. They have a house that’s 
probably more than they can afford, but 
each kid gets more room than they would 
have had in their last house. Maybe Jon’s 
quitting his job wasn’t the best move in 
the long run, but he has more time to be 
with the kids and do tag-team parenting 
with Kate. For those that haven’t been 
keeping up as religiously with their real­
ity TV, Jon and Kate have separated. Both 
Jon and Kate have their own places, and 
Jon has even found himself a snazzy little 
bachelor pad in New York City to enter­
tain various female acquaintances. The 
new season features both parents work­
ing through their separation and getting 
to spend time with their kids, well, sepa­
rately.
Now, from the evidence presented 
above, it doesn’t seem like Jon’s doing 
as well as a parent as one might hope he 
would. Kate’s also gotten her share of a 
media maelstrom for being bossy and an
attention hog, but it seems like Jon’s gal­
livanting about town seems to go mostly 
unnoticed compared to Kate’s own egre­
gious faults. Curious, I watched a few 
of the episodes over the summer just to 
see if what people were saying had any 
substance to them. Intriguingly enough, 
I found out that they did.
Kate took the eight kids out to an island 
getaway while Jon stayed at the house su­
pervising a new cabinet installation. Kate 
and some of her relatives shepherded the 
bevy of children onto a boat, fended off 
reporters hungry for a photograph, and 
zipped the kids to and from the pool on 
golf carts.
Jon, on the other hand, got to de­
cide where cabinets went in a house he 
doesn’t live in much, if at all. He directed 
workers who didn’t need much direc­
tion, nodding approvingly at profession­
als who would have been just as well off 
without him, and commented on their 
handicraft as though it were so innova­
tive that it couldn’t have been pulled off 
without his input.
In other episodes, Kate took the kids to 
a snake and reptile zoo, housing creatures 
that she’s scared of herself but knew that 
her kids would find exciting. She even 
tried to hold a python for them to show 
that she could conquer her fears and 
succeeded in doing so. Jon, on the other 
hand, took the girls out to play bumper 
cars for an afternoon. It seemed like the 
activity was something that Jon was hav­
ing more fun doing that his kids were. In 
contrast, Kate took the boys out to board 
a battleship that had been converted into 
a museum, something her boys loved but 
would obviously not be her first choice 
for entertainment.
So you decide. Are the better parents 
the ones who put their kids before them, 
even if it’s not what they would have 
wanted to do themselves? Or, are they 
the parents who, on leaving their chil­
dren’s lives, devote their time to their 
own happiness? When you become a par­
ent, you need to think about your kids’ 
happiness before your own, and if that 
means foregoing the NYC flat and stick­
ing it out with the snakes, then so be it.
Alex Yuschik (ahy@) has got to hand it to 
Kate Gosselin for keeping cool under both 
python and pudding pressure.
Anonymous bloggers should 
not be forced to reveal names
SABRINA PORTER
Free speech has been in the U.S. Con­
stitution since its inception. Unfortunate­
ly, our forefathers had not anticipated 
anonymous bloggers.
Most recently, the trend came into the 
public spotlight when a blogger with the 
alias PittGirl revealed herself to be Vir­
ginia Montanez, only to face the direct 
consequence of losing her job.
PittGirl’s blog, The Burgh Blog, criti­
cized her hometown of Pittsburgh, and 
most notably and without reserve, the 
actions of the mayor. Montanez had be­
grudgingly revealed her identity herself 
out of fear that it would quickly be un­
covered without her knowledge by the 
media.
The fact that Montanez lost her job is 
just a little bit ridiculous. Stephen Col­
bert, Jon Stewart, and cast members of 
Saturday Night Live criticize the actions 
of public officials and personalities all the 
way from Julia Roberts to the President 
of the United States on a daily basis, and 
make a living out of it. Their messages 
have been fueled by the same fire — criti­
cism of what these people do, how they 
act, and why they are the way they are.
Anonymous bloggers are not the first 
to go on record without revealing their 
identities. For centuries, writers have 
published novels, articles, and other 
pieces under carefully crafted pen names. 
And what is a blog if not an online piece 
of literature?
PittGirl is not the first case by far to 
cause big media controversy. Som6 cases 
of anonymous bloggers have even gone 
as far as the Supreme Court demanding 
the blogger unveil his identity.
The world has so many more problems 
right now that a Supreme Court case over 
a blog and a woman losing her job after 
revealing her identity as a critic of the 
Pittsburgh mayor just seem ridiculous.
Whatever people are saying about a 
person or an issue, it means that they 
care — and in the majority of cases, this 
should be taken as a compliment.Tfre 
public needs to learn to appreciate these 
anonymous bloggers for caring so much 
about the world to criticize it, and the 
people talked about need to learn to take 
the compliment that they are just that 
important in some people’s lives to be 
constantly blogged about. Anonymous 
bloggers are not going away, and the 
public needs to come to terms with it.

Leadership
Perspectives
Activities 
abound on 
campus
J.W. Ramp
Many of you have just finished 
your first week of classes here 
at Carnegie Mellon University, 
learned a new schedule, and are 
already deep in the trenches of 
your studies.
Here in the second week comes 
the Activities Fair, an opportunity 
to learn about the student groups 
on campus and maybe even find 
an outlet to get involved.
With over 200 student organi­
zations to choose from, it’s hard 
to walk down the many aisles set 
up on the CFA Lawn and not run 
into an organization that inter­
ests you.
From online gaming to spiri­
tual fellowships, Greek life to 
bagpipes and Ultimate, the Office 
of Student Activities is putting to­
gether the perfect place for you to 
connect with other involved stu­
dents here.-
So I’m here to encourage you to 
pursue those opportunities — my 
time here has been so enriched by 
the experiences had with student 
activities.
I’ve had access to cover the 
Presidential election season from 
behind the barricades and been 
given the opportunity to spend 
a week as a missionary in Ecua­
dor — all the while alongside my 
peers that I learned to see as so 
much more than students.
Let’s take The Tartan as an ex­
ample — putting a newspaper 
together is so much more than 
reporting and photography.
We have amazingly skilled 
layout and production staff 
members, copy staff — who are 
students who edit all of our ar­
ticles — those who maintain our 
network of computers and award- 
winning website, and business 
and advertising teams that keep 
our free newspaper showing up 
for you every week.
The experience of working 
together with such high-caliber 
individuals has been both edu­
cational and rewarding — you’ll 
find this in a whole array of or­
ganizations manning tables on 
Wednesday.
Whether that experience re­
sults in a hilarious TV program, 
a stunning fashion show, or just 
an opportunity to be with others 
that you have a good time with, 
getting involved in a student or­
ganization is an essential part of 
the college experience.
So come out Wednesday after­
noon and swing by some of our

Students should not sue colleges for lack of employment
ALIESHA JONES
After spending over $65,000 
on tuition and four years in col­
lege, one would think that Tri­
na Thompson would be smart 
enough to figure out that Amer­
ica is experiencing a recession, 
which means she isn’t guaranteed 
a job right after graduation. Un­
fortunately, that does not seem to 
be the case.
According to a recent article 
from the New York Post, Thomp­
son graduated from Monroe 
College in April with a degree in 
information technology. After 
graduation, she filed a lawsuit 
against Monroe College in Bronx 
Supreme Court because she had 
yet to find employment.
Even if we weren’t in a re­
cession, 100 percent of college 
graduates do not get jobs right 
after school. Is this news to any­
one? Aside from simply pointing 
out that Thompson seems to lack 
common sense, this move to sue 
her alma mater is another exam-
ple of a case with no merit taking 
up space in civil courts’ dockets.
I used to want to be an attorney, 
to defend liberty, justice, the pur­
suit of property, and all that jazz; 
but the pursuit of funds willingly 
paid to an institution in return for 
an education, which Thompson 
received, qualifies as a waste of 
time.
Finding a job after college is 
a lot more intensive than sitting 
around and waiting to get hired. 
I wonder what could drive a col­
lege student to give up the job 
hunt and instead invest whatever 
monies she has left into attacking 
the justice system.
What does this accomplish? 
Winning this lawsuit — a far from 
likely outcome — may give her 
enough money to pay back loans 
and legal fees, but she’ll still be 
unemployed. More than likely, 
her case will be dismissed, or 
dropped, or whatever the proper 
legal term is for not getting any 
attention; she will be in even 
greater debt from all the legal 
fees; her family will be embar­
rassed and made fun of in grocery 
stores and at doctors’ offices; and 
she will have an even harder time
finding a compny to hire her 
after they disccer she was that 
college gradua; who sued her 
school and faile.
This case is r;ht up there with 
the poor, misguled fools who are 
ignorant enoug to put their busi­
ness out on dytime television 
and show thei faces on Judge 
Alex: “So you’r saying you stole 
his car, but youire suing him for 
not putting in eough gas for you 
to drive across le country, in his 
car?” “Yes, younonor.”
In Thompsois defense, I can 
understand he frustration and 
desperate needto form a course 
of action, follov through, and see 
results.
I’ve met pmty of college 
graduates who even before our 
economy begai to decline, were 
struggling to gt hired and start 
their careers.
People from art and design 
backgrounds t people holding 
master’s degre6 in satellite com­
munications; dl jobless, or at 
least not hired n a position that 
relates to the ;ubject that they 
studied for yeas (getting hired to 
work as a trucl loader for FedEx 
at 3 a.m. ever morning is not
the career most architecture ma­
jors see themselves having after 
graduation).
Personally, I would have been 
a little angry, even bitter, had I 
spent so much time, energy, and 
money in college (at Carnegie 
Mellon, no less!) and was not able 
to find a job.
But then I would watch an epi­
sode of House or TrueBlood, have 
a few laughs, and then really sit 
and think about why I am unem­
ployed, because at the end of the 
day, it is me who is unemployed. 
Not Carnegie Mellon, or Monroe 
College. Me.
I would ask myself if I went 
through every possible channel I 
had available to me to find a job. 
Did I utilize the career center? Did 
I post my resume online for com­
panies to see? Did I make a typo 
in my cover letter? Am I apply­
ing to the wrong companies? Are 
they searching for me on Google 
and finding an incriminating Fa- 
cebook photo?
I really want to ask Thompson 
these questions and see if she 
exhausted all her resources. My 
guess is, the answer is no. Well, let 
me not make assumptions. Maybe
she really searched and tried her 
hardest but still couldn’t get a job. 
At that point, I would’ve told her 
to go back home. Go live with 
mom. Go work at Forever 21.
Honestly, a job is a job, and 
some income is better than no in­
come. But what if Forever 21 isn’t 
hiring?
Well, then, maybe that’s the 
point when she should consider 
going back to school, But what if 
she couldn’t afford it?
Well. Then. Maybe she should 
pick up a hobby and keep up the 
job search. Because, in all hon­
esty, until you find a job, the hunt 
does not stop.
It is within our genetic code to 
hunt until we are satisfied, until 
our needs our met and we are 
content with our environment.
Now, is filing a lawsuit against 
my college part of our genetically 
coded hunt for satisfaction?
No. That is called a random 
mutation, of which natural selec­
tion will hopefully rid the world.

Pittsburgh uses G20 to ihowcase local artwork
HEATHER TOMKO
Ever since it was announced 
that the 2009 G20 Summit would 
be held in Pittsburgh, it was trum­
peted as a chance for the city to 
shine, to show what Pittsburgh 
was really made of.
Other than those seemingly 
important words, however, there 
is not much reference to how the 
people of Pittsburgh were to do 
that.
Of course, there were the usual 
complaints about the effect that 
the G20 would have on many of 
the city’s businesses due to secu­
rity concerns—that many of them 
would have to close down and 
lose vital revenue for the duration 
of the summit.
And also, of course, there were 
people who told the others to stop 
whining and complaining, and to 
think of the positive things that 
the summit would bring to the 
city.
Another group of people, how­
ever, has taken their own spin on 
what aspect of Pittsburgh they 
want visitors to see when they 
come for the G20. According to a 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article, a 
coalition of multiple arts groups 
in Pittsburgh — aptly named 
ARTS and headed by the dean 
of the College of Fine Arts — has 
formed to show people what an 
important effect art has on the 
city of Pittsburgh and its people.
The article cites a four-part 
message that the coalition hopes 
to leave visitors with: Art trans­
forms Pittsburgh. Art employs 
Pittsburgh. Art “greens” Pitts­
burgh. Art inspires Pittsburgh.
I really appreciate the differ­
ent spin that the coalition is put­
ting on what would normally be 
thought of as a business-oriented 
event. And it really is the perfect 
time to show off Pittsburgh’s art 
scene — the city keeps being told 
that this could be their chance to 
shine, and I think it’s great that
ARTS is stepping up and taking 
the oft-heard warning to heart.
And what many people may 
not realize is that Pittsburgh does 
have a vibrant arts scene. There 
is, of course, the Cultural Dis­
trict, which showcases a number 
of musicals and plays on a rotat­
ing basis, as well as the always- 
constant staple of the symphony. 
While Pittsburgh might not be a 
performing mecca on the level 
of cities like New York or Los An­
geles, I have been to a number of 
shows of all types and can person­
ally attest to their quality. In addi­
tion, there are a number of muse­
ums for more visually based art. 
Not only are there the Carnegie 
Museums of Art and Natural His­
tory, there are also lesser-known 
museums like the Mattress Fac­
tory or the Warhol Museum, all of 
which have interesting and varied 
displays.
In addition, Pittsburgh has so 
many small cultural neighbor­
hoods that all have their unique 
architecture. Two summers ago, 
my internship took me on a field 
trip to the Mattress Factory, and 
I discovered that a block or two 
away from the museum were a 
few beautifully painted and deco­
rated houses.
I was so surprised to learn that 
something so unique and beauti­
ful existed on a random block in 
a random neighborhood. Because 
Pittsburgh is inhabited by people 
of different cultures that original­
ly tended to form neighborhoods 
to stick together, cultural land­
marks can be found all through­
out the city.
Carnegie Mellon also got a spe­
cific mention in the article, where 
it stated that our architecture 
program is ranked number one 
in terms of teaching sustainable 
design, in reference to the coali­
tion’s message that art “greens” 
Pittsburgh.
What impresses me most about 
the coalition’s efforts, however, is 
their perseverance and dedication 
to their cause. Because of the still- 
undecided security measures that 
loom in the city’s future, many
businesses in le area are plan­
ning on just osing completely 
to cut their los:s (and, of course, 
complaining abut it). ARTS, on 
the other hands taking the exact 
opposite apprcch.
They are h^ing tcf keep as 
much open as ossible; they un­
derstand that i order for the city 
to be seen in thoest way possible, 
it needs to sea alive, not like a 
ghost town wit numerous closed 
businesses.
And the list cwhat ARTS hopes 
to have going a during the sum­
mit is actually quite extensive.
The Post-Gazette article lists 
maintaining regular jhours for 
the Liberty Avenue art galleries 
and the Wood Street galleries, as 
well as Space, another gallery; 
free performances at the plaza 
at Seventh St. and Penn Ave.; 
and performances by an Indian 
dance group, a flamenco dancer, 
and singers from the Pittsburgh 
opera.
So while most Pittsburgh 
residents and G20 delegates are 
focusing on economic issues
during the summit, I hope that 
people are able to take a few min­
utes off and check out what the 
Pittsburgh arts scene has to offer
— it may be more impressive than 
people think, and will certainly 
help to put the city in a better 
light at a time when all eyes will 
be on it.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) is 
Forum editor and wonders if she 
has made her love for Pittsburgh 
clear yet — it goes way past the 
Steelers.

SPORTS COMMI' NIARY
Sifting through knee-jerk reactions
SHAFIQUE RASHID
Much has been said concerning former New 
York Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress since 
that infamous Friday night in November of last 
year, when Burress shot himself in the right leg 
at a New York nightclub. This event made him 
an easy target for initial barbs toward his intel­
ligence and jokes about shooting himself in the 
foot, both figuratively and literally, as charges 
for the criminal possession of a handgun fell 
upon Burress. But public sentiment toward the 
situation has changed since then, coming to a 
head when Burress’ sentence of two years in 
prison was finalized in a plea bargain last week, 
with people beginning to question whether Bur­
ress was being made an example by the justice 
system.
The two-year sentence causes Burress to leave 
much behind, including a recently signed $35 
million contract, a Super Bowl contending team, 
and a new daughter due at the end of Novem­
ber. In a humanizing interview last week with
ESPN’s Jeremy Schap, Burress explained that he 
only had the handgun with him because team­
mate Steve Smith had been robbed at gunpoint 
a few days earlier. That night Burress picked up 
a teammate who lives near Smith, Ahmad Brad­
shaw, and thus he brought the gun with him as 
protection. Burress subsequently kept the gun in 
thè waistband of his pants upon arriving at the 
nightclub. According to Burress, security allowed 
him to enter the club with the weapon. Soon af­
terward, Burress revealed during his interview, 
the gun dislodged itself and began to slide down 
Burress’s leg. As he attempted to stop the falling 
gun, he accidentally pressed the trigger, send­
ing a bullet through his right thigh. Burress was 
driven to a hospital by teammate Antonio Pierce 
and was treated for the flesh wound. The hospital 
did not contact police, as would normally have 
been protocol in that situation, and Burress also 
said during the interview that the hospital ad­
mitted him under an alias.
The NYPD reportedly did not learn of the Bur­
ress situation until it was reported on the news. 
Only then was he charged with criminal posses­
sion of his weapon, as he did not own a license 
to possess a gun in either New York or his cur­
rent home state of New Jersey. Even worse, the 
license he had for a gun in the state of Florida 
was expired, so Burress didn’t have any business 
carrying a handgun in any state.
Now, it can be argued that if Burress were 
the average Joe, he would have slipped through 
the cracks and avoided charges, since Average 
Joe would not have gotten the media coverage 
that Burress received, tipping the NYPD off to 
his criminal gun possession. Average Joe would 
also not have had to deal with New York mayor 
Michael Bloomberg publicly announcing that he 
should be penalized to the fullest extent of the 
law. But would Average Joe have been able to get 
into the club with a gun scot-free? Would Aver­
age Joe have received seemingly preferential 
treatment at the hospital? For every celebrity 
who is “made an example of” by law enforcement 
officials, many more are given leniency that the 
rest of the population does not receive. The U.S. 
justice system is inherently a subjective process, 
one that celebrities and average Joes alike must
face once exposing themselves to it. Complaining 
about the incredulity of Burress going to jail for 
simply shooting himself is ignoring the real situ­
ation at hand — that he was illegally possessing 
a handgun, one that he did not make sure to se­
cure. It is Burress’s responsibility, like anybody 
else’s, to know the laws of the state he resides 
in. New York gun laws are as tough as they get, 
and the sentence he received is completely in line 
with it.
The bullet that went through Burress’ leg re­
portedly came very close to hitting a security 
guard nearby. That Burress was walking around 
a packed New York City club carrying an unhol- 
stered gun, without a safety enabled, is down­
right scary. Any innocent bystander could have 
been killed that night by Burress’ reckless be­
havior. If it’s true that a lower profile individual 
would have gotten away with a lesser penalty, 
then that is very unfortunate. Perhaps in most 
other situations, more leniency may have been 
exercised, but at least this time they got it right.
Hall to join other model athletes and appear on NCAA on Campus
KATHERINE F. YANG
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team member and 
business administration senior Jon Hall has been 
selected to be featured on the September episode of 
NCAA on Campus. The show is set to air on CBS Col­
lege Sports on Wednesday, Sept. 2 at 9 p.m.
NCAA on Campus is a monthly 30-minute look at 
stories of student athletes from across the nation 
featuring interviews and insights from friends. The 
show highlights students who have demonstrated 
excellence not only in sports but also in academics 
and community involvement. On the field, Hall has 
started all 55 games in his three years on the Tartan
soccer team as a defensive back. He is also a three-time 
member of the All-University Athletic Associatipn and 
was named the 2008 ESPN The Magazine Men’s Soccer 
Academic All-American of the Year. Even more impres­
sively, off the field, Hall boasts a 4.0 GPA at the Tepper 
School of Business as a business and finance major and 
is involved in the Business Opportunities Conference 
as a co-chair, serves in Students in Free Enterprise as 
a senior adviser to the executive board, and last year 
helped establish the Tartan Olympics as a co-chair of 
the Student-Athlete Advisory Council.
Even with such an impressive list of credentials, Hall 
was surprised to find himself selected.
“I was extremely shocked when I found out I was 
selected to be interviewed for a national program,”
said Hall. “I’m definitely humbled'by the selection. The 
whole process of filming this episode with friends and 
professors made me realize how fortunate I am to have 
such support to which I completely credit my success.”
Hall will be joining a prestigious list of student ath­
letes, including San Diego State’s Stephen Strasburg, 
the number one pick in the 2009 MLB draft; Univer­
sity of Georgia’s Courtney Kupets, arguably the great­
est gymnast in NCAA history; and Loyola University’s 
Phil Scholz, who didn’t let his blindness stop him from 
becoming a member of the Loyola Greyhounds swim 
team or a resident assistant.
The show will be reaired each Wednesday of Sep­
tember before being added to archives on the NCAA’s 
website, www.ncaa.org.

Here we go Steelers! The Pirates are still losing
Jonas Altman-Kurosaki
Last semester, I wrote an ar­
ticle warning Pirates fans not to 
get their hopes up because this 
year — like the past 16 — would 
not be “the year” for Pittsburgh’s 
ball club. The Pirates’ stingi­
ness in dealing with players’ 
contracts, whether they be pros­
pects or veterans, would surely 
be their downfall not only this 
year, but for years to come.
Well, I was halfway there. I 
still gave them too much credit.
I’m a Mets fan, which means I 
have to deal with cheering for a 
team so depleted by injuries that, 
on Sunday, the starting lineup 
included only three players that 
were^on the Opening Day ros­
ter. Pirates fans face a similar 
dilemma: the Pirates also only 
had three players in Sunday’s 
starting lineup that were in the 
Opening Day lineup, but for an 
entirely different reason. Their 
lineup has been depleted by 
trades.
One of the topics I’d touched 
upon in my previous article was
the long-term contracts awarded 
to Nate McLouth and Ryan 
Doumit, young offensive stars 
for the Pirates last year: “The 
three-year deals for Doumit 
and McLouth provide hope that 
a young, talented core to build 
a winning franchise, around is 
finally being established, but 
just wait until their three years 
are up. If they’ve produced up 
to expectations, their monetary 
yearnings will no doubt be out of 
the Pirates’ and Nutting’s minis­
cule range.” Well, it turns out I 
was about two and a half years 
off—while Doumit still dons the 
black and yellow, McLouth was 
traded to the Atlanta Braves on 
June 3 for three prospects, only 
one of them noteworthy. Calling 
the move shocking would be an 
understatement.
“There ain’t a guy in here who 
ain’t [ticked] off about it,’-’ said 
then-first baseman Adam La- 
Roche in an interview with the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “If they 
feel like it’s the best move for 
three or four years from now, 
great. Unfortunately, that does 
me no good.”
“Wow,” added then-second 
baseman Freddy Sanchez in the 
report.
But the Pirates weren’t done 
there. On June 30, Nyjer Mor­
gan — another player I’d men­
tioned as being an integral part 
of the Pirates’ core — was traded 
alongside pitcher Sean Burnett 
to the Washington Nationals 
for troubled outfielder Lastings 
Milledge, who is far past his days 
of being a top prospect, and Joel 
Hanrahan, a reliever who had 
struggled so much that he lost 
his closer role with Washington 
earlier this year.
Jack Wilson, the longest- 
tenured Pirate at the time, was 
slightly put off in an interview, 
with MLB.com about the deal: 
“We understand that it’s a busi­
ness and that they have to do 
what they have to do to make 
the team better. Hopefully it 
does. I just know there are a lot 
of people in this clubhouse who 
aren’t going to be here, so we 
don’t care too much about it.... 
I’ve been here for nine years and 
seen these trades two or three 
times every year and still haven’t
had a winning season.”
Well, Wilson just might be 
able to have that winning sea­
son this year. That’s because he 
was traded a month later to the 
Seattle Mariners. Sanchez was 
also traded that day to the San 
Francisco Giants, while LaRoche 
was traded a week prior to the 
Boston Red Sox. Also gone are 
pitchers Tom Gorzelanny and 
John Grabow, who were traded 
to the Chicago Cubs.
So, .while I was technically 
right that Doumit, outfielder An­
drew McCutchen and first base­
man Steve Pearce would be parts 
of the talented core the Pirates 
would hopefully build a fran­
chise around, things do not look 
encouraging for the defending 
record holders for consecutive 
losing seasons.’There are some 
silver linings — McCutchen and 
fellow rookie outfielder Garrett 
Jones are both having fantas­
tic years right now — but don’t 
worry, folks. They won’t be here 
much longer. The revolving door 
of players is moving so fast, it’ll 
make your head spin.
So don’t get too comfortable.

Hope springs eternal for fall sports, ready to compete
JONAS ALTMAN-KUROSAKI
Acting Sports Co-editor
When the men’s soccer team kicks off at Washington and Jefferson 
University and the women’s volleyball team opens at home against 
Marietta College this Tuesday at 7 p.m., it will mark the beginning 
of the new fall season for Tartans Athletics. This season, as always, 
brings much excitement and anticipation, while we welcome in new 
faces and bid one final adieu to the old. Those new faces not only in­
clude first-years, but new women’s assistant soccer coach Jen Myhre 
and a boatload of new fans ready to cheer on their team, whether it be 
soccer, cross country, volleyball, or football.Here’s what players and coaches have to say about the upcoming year:
Men’s Cross Country: Chris Rizzo, senior: “We lost a lot of strong run­
ners, but the depth from previous years will cover it. We’re looking at 
the same type of team that has always been underrated and always
beats expectations.”
Women’s Cross Country: Laura McKee, junior, captain: “Despite hav­
ing a lot of turnover, our team still has a solid group of returning up­
perclassmen. An excellent first-year class will make us stronger as a 
team over the next four years. This should be an exciting year for the 
Women’s XC team as we look to improve on our UAA and regional fin­
ishes.”
Volleyball: Megan Killeen, Senior: “Even right out of preseason, the 
level of play is just so much higher than it has been in previous seasons
— the team dynamic, especially with so many senior players, has re­
ally allowed for this athletic development. Our three first-year players 
have also added some extra leeway and have created more depth in 
our team. With such a seasoned team, we expect to have an amazing 
season, hopefully one that will be record-breaking once again at the 
NCAA tournament. I know we are all really excited to get back on the 
competitive court and finally play as a team again.”
Men’s Soccer: Arron Lujan, head coach: “The preseason went well.
We have a lot of returning players that are looking to build upon our 
success that we had last year. We also have new players that will add a 
lot to our team.”
Women’s Soccer: Jen Myhre, assistant coach: “We are looking for­
ward to this upcoming season, as we have a strong first-year class who 
has the ability to make an immediate impact on our team. We held our 
own in a scrimmage against Kenyon and throughout the game began 
working the ball well out of the back and attacking in the box. We defi­
nitely have some perfecting to do, but are off to a great start for a com­
petitive and successful season.”
Football: Rich Lackner, head coach: “There are lots of new faces on 
the football team this season and I like the group of [first-years] that 
we recruited. The team came to preseason camp in good shape and we 
had a very productive camp. The team worked very hard and is com­
ing together nicely. Our expectations are always high! We have had 
great tradition over the years and the team and coaches work hard to 
continue that tradition.”

Acting Sports Co-editor
It’s the first week of school and already Tar­
tan athletes from football, soccer, volleyball, 
and cross country have hit the ground running 
in preparation for the upcoming fall season. 
Volleyball is aiming for another final finish in 
the UAAs, while 21st-ranked men’s soccer and 
football are looking to make the NCAA Division 
III Championship for the second year in a row. 
Also on the radar is sixth-ranked women’s ten­
nis, who last year made the NCAAs but fell in 
the quarterfinals to rival University of Chicago. 
Although official practice has not yet begun, 
the men’s and women’s swimming and diving 
teams, as well as both tennis teams, have al­
ready begun practice for play that begins in late 
September to early October. Such dedication 
from the school’s athletes shines true of the Tar­
tan work ethic, and will hopefully yield success­
ful results in the weeks to come.
This week marks the start of dual matches for 
most of the fall sports. Volleyball will kick off
their season when they play Marietta College 
at Wiegand Gymnasium on Tuesday at 7 p.m. 
Shortly thereafter, the Tartans will travel to 
the Gettysburg Tournament hosted by St. John 
Fisher College in Gettysburg, beginning Friday, 
Sept. 4.
Tuesday night is also when both men and 
women’s soccer begin their fall season. The 
men’s team will open at Washington and Jef­
ferson College in Washington, Pa., while the 
women’s team will play at home against number 
20 Denison in Gesling Stadium, with kickoff set 
for 7:30 p.m.
Football will begin their schedule this week, 
with the whistle set to blow on Friday at 1 p.m. 
against Ohio Wesleyan in Gesling Stadium. 
Cross country’s first meet will commence earlier 
in the day with a 9 a.m. start at the Duquesne 
Duals, held at Duquesne University in Pitts­
burgh.

low play live, live stats are available at www.

Students turn waste into art
Exhibit promotes green-consciousness
Everything you need to know
About making the move and getting the trash
Plastic grocery bags have gotten a bad rap in 
today’s green-conscious society. But what if 
your average Giant Eagle grocery carrier could 
be a building block in the creation of a space?
Is it possible for waste to be transformed into 
an enjoyable environment? These questions 
are answered in the Low-Density Polyethylene 
(LDPE) installation, aptly titled LDPE Loop, 
created by four Carnegie Mellon fourth-year 
architecture students: Filip Agren, Max Arocena, 
Conor Doyle, and Liz Duray.
“We are in a wasteful moment in society,” 
said Arocena about the inspiration for the 
project. “There is no respect for what’s old and 
what’s already there. There are [artists] doing 
installations and going to Home Depot to buy 
their materials; we are turning people’s trash into 
something that’s beautiful.”
The installation, currently being displayed in 
downtown Pittsburgh at the Future Tenant Art 
Gallery, certainly achieves this element of beauty. 
The ethereal curtains of woven plastic bags 
transform the gallery space into a passageway - 
that moves and sways with the visitor. A 
juxtaposition of smaller passageways opening up 
into a larger, communal space guides a person 
from the entrance to what the artists have 
dictated as “nodes of importance”: a bench for 
resting or the bar for socializing.
“My initial impression was ‘Where do I go?”' 
said senior mathematical sciences major and 
musician Dan Lacker. “I started exploring and 
realized that the installation was guiding me." 
The opening of the exhibit that took place last 
Friday featured live music by Lacker and pianist 
Patrick McGettigan, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus. 
Around a hundred students, faculty, and alumni 
of Carnegie Mellon were brought together by the 
art.
The installation is the second in a series of 
projects exploring space and its relationship 
to audience created from material otherwise 
deemed waste. Last year, the project titled 
Canopy, created by Agren, Arocena, Duray, and 
two other fourth-year architecture majors — Ellen 
Garret and Judy Podraza — used aluminum 
cans to form 15 hexagonal structures that were 
fit together, creating an organic shape, then 
suspended from the ceiling. The current LDPE 
installation is also a free-form structure that 
makes use of a pattern, the weaving of the plastic 
bags, while still maintaining a natural, non­
calculated form. The artists have been working 
on the concept and execution of the project 
throughout the summer, culminating in the past 
two weeks with late nights at Future Tenant 
weaving the bags together.
To plan the installation, the artists relied on their 
own drawings rather than computer-created
imagery. The space of the gallery was also taken 
into account; lines of tension wire were mounted 
parallel to the ceiling tiles, and the bags were 
then attached to these wires to make full use of 
the room. The natural light from the entrance was 
also taken into consideration in the design, with 
the translucent material of the bags creating a
warm and welcoming atmosphere in the areas of 
interest chosen by the four artists.
Glenn Stroz | Photo Staff
The installation was constructed entirely from 
LDPE bags donated by Giant Eagle and the 
residents of Shadyside.
Apart from the aid received in the form of a 
grant from Carnegie Mellon, all of the materials 
were donated by Giant Eagle and the people of 
Shadyside. “We went door to door asking people 
to give us their extra bags,” said Arocena, who 
estimates that about 5000 were used in the 
project. "[The installation] also shows the buying 
habits of people in Shadyside.” While the majority 
are white and blue bacjs with the emblem of 
Giant Eagle, a few Target and CVS logos pepper 
the sheets of plastic.
"I’d love to see this on a larger scale," said senior 
design major Natalia Olbinski. For now, the 
LDPE bags of the installation, like the cans from 
Canopy, will return from whence they came: 
back to waste, recycled and reused by Pittsburgh 
Giant Eagle customers.

Dear Rohit,
I am not really great when it 
comes to the dating scene. I 
falter a lot when it comes to the 
pivotal step — you know, making 
the move. What should I do?
—Still Inexperienced, Not Great 
Lover Emotionally
Dear SINGLE,
Meeting someone is less about 
“making a move” and more about 
starting a conversation. Just start 
talking about something; be friendly. 
Even if you’re just at the grocery 
store, getting the conversation 
started is about 60 percent of 
the battle (another 30 percent is 
getting his or her number, and 
the remaining 10 percent is not 
embarrassing yourself during the 
actual conversation). Once you’re 
talking, stay alert to any relationship 
status clues and whether he or she 
seems to be digging you. Then go 
for it!
Here’s my expert advice when 
it comes to situations like this. 
Generally, you can at least tell if 
someone finds you somewhat 
interesting and/or attractive. If you 
genuinely feel there’s a connection 
and you’d like to see him or her 
again, what do you have to lose? As 
long as it’s not someone- you work 
with, the absolute worst thing that 
could happen is you ask for his or 
her number and you get a “no." 
However, the best case is that you’ll 
fell in love, have lots of hot crazy 
sex, get married, and live happily 
ever after — the fairytale ending we 
aH want.
So get down to it, okay? You’ve 
got to date a few that aren’t perfect 
before you find one that is. Oh, and 
let me know if your love interest has 
a sister.
Single and ready to mingle,
— Rohit
/
Dear Rohit,
I can’t live without everything 
in my room being absolutely 
spotless, but my roommate is a 
slob. Everything else between us 
is great, but I’m sick of cleaning 
up after him. How can I save our 
friendship without cleaning up 
all the time?
—Nearly Emotional About Trash 
Dear NEAT,
This is a situation that is played out 
in many a dorm room and ends with 
varying degrees of trash left lying 
around. What you need to do first 
is to think about what you can and 
cannot deal with. You really cannot 
expect your roommate to completely 
turn around and be as clean as you, 
so be prepared for it.
Try talking to him about the things 
you cannot bear, even for a moment, 
to see in your room, and ask him to 
put in an effort. If that works, then 
maybe you can push a bit more. 
If not, get out your war dress and 
annoy him to the point that he has 
no choice left.
Wait, that was a joke, don’t do that. 
Just give him a few subtle hints by 
putting all his trash in and around his 
bed. He’ll get the point and then you 
have a germ-free zone to live in.
Don’t forget to recycle,
— Rohit

Tales from abroad: Christchurch
Ten amazing things to do down south in New Zealand
Since the day I got back to the U.S. from spending my spring 
semester studying abroad in Christchurch, New Zealand, I 
have been met with the somewhat annoying but completely 
reasonable question: "How was New Zealand?” And every 
time I find myself faced with this question, the words “It was 
so fun! ” come out of my mouth. The first time this happened,
I realized I had just used those words to describe one of the 
most amazing times of my life, and it made me cringe. In 
fact, my experience was not just “so fun”: it was incredible, 
exciting, terrifying, full of novel things, new experiences, 
things I learned to love, things I learned to appreciate, and, 
above all, people I will never forget.
I picked Christchurch based on three requirements: English 
language use, location and weather, and program duration. 
While these were all very important factors, when I found 
out that one particular school had a three-week-long spring 
break, I immediately picked it. And I am so happy I made that 
choice.
I spent my first week in New Zealand getting to know the 
other people in my program, since I had left the US. not 
knowing a single person who would be in the country. At 
college, I took an indigenous language course that helped me 
pronounce names of cities and landmarks, a marine biology 
course that helped me learn about the nature there, and a 
New Zealand history course, where I learned a lot about the 
country’s past. But my experience in New Zealand was hardly 
shaped by my classes.
My semester was marked by weekend road trips, trying more 
new things than I ever thought possible, and spending it with 
the most amazing people in the world.
Trekking on Franz Josef glacier can take up to eight hours.
I am going to try to detail 10 of my favorite experiences from 
studying abroad.
1. Hiking the Abel Tasman Coastal Track. This three- 
to-five-day hiking trail is located on the northern part of the 
south island. (This would be the time to do a Google image 
search of New Zealand and realize that it has two main 
islands.) Half the track is across beaches and the other half is 
through mountains. Not only was it incredibly beautiful, but 
I did the walk with 13 other people, which made the entire 
experience much more fun.
2. Learning to surf. I had never done this before and I have 
to say that I am a pro surfer now!
3. Bungee jumping. For those who have ever been 
skydiving, I think you will love bungee jumping. It was one 
of the most terrifying and amazing things I have ever done. I 
thought I was going to pee in my pants.
4. Following a shark in the Great Barrier Reef. I spent 
my three-week mid-semester break in Australia and was able 
to go both snorkeling and scuba diving in the Great Barrier 
Reef. At one point while I was snorkeling, I happened to see 
something that looked like a shark probably no less than three 
feet and no more than 20 meters beneath me.
I was so excited by the fact that I saw a shark that I started 
following it. After a few minutes, I started to get bored and 
then looked around only to find that I was pretty far from 
everyone else. When I looked back into the water I couldn’t 
see the shark anymore. That’s when it got really scary and I 
swam as fast as I could back to the boat.
5. Driving 3000 km (1900 miles) down the eastern 
coast of Australia. There are so many things I can think to 
say about this trip, but I think I’ll just go with a word montage: 
beaches, kangaroos, sleeping in the car, drunken old men, 
flashers, sand dunes, erotic novels, opera house, tent, BBQs, 
koalas, plumbers, Coochin Hills, speeding ticket, lagoon, 
diarrhea, Nutella, bars, no showers, road kill. I’ll let everyone 
try to put the story together.
6. Hiking a glacier. I was fortunate that my boyfriend was 
able to come out and spend eight amazing days with me. 
While he was there, we drove to one of the two most well- 
known glaciers in New Zealand — Franz Josef — and did 
an eight-hour hike. It is hard to explain why it was such an 
incredible experience, but it was the magnitude of the glacier 
and the amazing forces of nature that came together'to form it 
that I couldn’t stop thinking about.
7. Being on the sets of Lord of the Rings. While seeing
Hobbiton, Mount Doom, and the jewelry shop that the original 
Ring was made in, I didn’t even realize I was walking through 
places from Lord of the Rings. I got to sit inside Bilbo's house 
and see the party tree, and I actually bought an exact replica 
of “the One Ring.” »
.8. Black water rafting. I went into a cave for the first time 
in my life and saw glow worms that looked like the Milky Way. 
I also got to raft my way down and lead the group of people I 
was with through parts of the cave.

New Zealand is a very picturesque country.
9. Zorbing. I can’t really think of a good way to describe this, 
but the best way to understand is to YouTube it. Basically, a 
giant plastic ball is suspended within an even larger plastic 
ball. In the smaller one, some water and a person are put in 
and then the whole thing is rolled down a hill. Sounds lame? 
Turns out it was one of the most hysterical and surprisingly 
fun things I did in New Zealand.
10 Meeting people I will be friends with forever. I met
a guy on a city bus that knew my favorite college football 
team, and he was the first person to tell me when their 
quarterback was drafted to the NFL. I met another guy who 
let me stay with his parents and his best friends even though 
we had only known each other for a few weeks.
I also met a guy from England who has become one of my 
best friends. A girl I met for about 10 minutes in the U.S. — 
just because our parents knew each other — let me stay with 
her for four days in Australia. I met people from all over the 
United States who have become some of my closest friends 
and I miss them terribly.
If I were given a chance to go back to New Zealand tomorrow, 
I would take it up in a heartbeat. I did so many amazing 
things, but there are still so many more things I would like to 
do. I hope sometime soon I will be able to go back.

Monkeys get third-time lucky
Humbug reinvents band’s style of music
There must be something about third albums. 
Radiohead took the world on full force with the 
triumphant release of OK Computer, vastly integrating 
electronic sounds into the very core of their sound 
and lyrics, completing the revisionary need of Thom 
Yorke, the band’s lead singer; Wilco became a sunny 
source of pop on Summerteeth, erasing the hereditary 
characteristics of the band’s predecessor, Uncle Tupelo; 
The White Stripes abandoned their low-fi roots to create 
a band based solely on the interplay of guitar, voice, 
and a simple drum rhythm; and now come the Arctic 
Monkeys with their new album, Humbug.
The Arctic Monkeys’ first album, Whatever People Say
I Ami That's What I'm Not, became the quickest-selling
Kristen Severson I Photo Editor
The Arctic Monkeys returns with its new album 
Humbug and moves away from its tried and tested
sound.
debut album in British history. This formula revolved 
around the mixture of sharp-hitting guitar clips 
surrounding lead singer Alex Turner’s vocals and the 
band’s slower tunes, which felt two-dimensional. This 
formula was stretched out with their sophomore album, 
Favourite Worst Nightmare, by introducing a darker 
aspect to the band while retaining a high-energy affair, 
but the album still felt somewhat stale in comparison.
Insert Humbug. What an interesting album. There is 
no sustained attack to the senses on the first track. 
Humbug defies the formula that catapulted the band to 
success. The album no longer attempts to stretch this 
formula out further and further until the sound becomes 
ultimately stale beyond belief, a la The Strokes. Humbug 
has taken the complex and irregular aspects, be they 
vocals, guitar, or bass lines, found within Whatever 
and has produced them into a state that is seemingly 
simpler, though Humbug resonates within the soul 
deeper and longer.
“Crying Lightning” is the epitome of Humbug. It starts 
slowly with a fairly simple beat and drum line, but this 
generic sound is transformed with the introduction of 
Turner. It differentiates the song from the binary formula 
of Whatever and Favourite by creating a building block 
on which the rest of the song adds until the cathartic 
release, as Turner carefully and repeatedly articulates 
the words "crying lightning.”
Turner’s new articulation marks the transformation of 
Arctic Monkeys. The band is no longer the amateur 
super-pop celebrities heard on Whatever, but has 
beceme the mature and contemplative complexity of 
Humbug.
There are still some quick songs, such as the great 
"Pretty Visitors" and the not-quite-good “Potion 
Approaching,” but they are airier and not immediately 
likable, as was Whatever. The hooks are gone, but the 
album rewards listeners by growing on them quickly.
The Arctic Monkeys have followed great bands by 
recreating their formula within the third album, but the 
best might be coming along the horizon. Radiohead 
followed their third album with the amazing album Kid 
A\ Wilco with their best album in Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, 
The White Stripes became legends with Elephant. If the 
closing cacophony of sounds in the finale of Humbug, 
“The Jeweller’s Hands,” is any indication, the Arctic 
Monkeys might very well be on the right track.

On wallowing
I know I’ve only made it through the first week of classes, but I am 
already exhausted. Every day by about three o’clock, I am ready to 
take a nap. For those of you well-acquainted with the all-important 
ritual of napping, you know that it is a very serious practice, and its 
success hinges on any number of variables like blanket choice, general 
atmosphere, and, of course, music.
There have to be a million songs written about sleep (after all, don’t we 
spend about a third of our life doing this? Cao someone please give me 
an update on this statistic?). In the last week I’ve been rediscovering 
The Smiths’ song “Asleep.”
I can remember first stumbling on this song in middle school, those 
formative years of anxiety and woe, characterized by many of us 
through the mix tapes we listened to, the basements we smoked 
in, the beat literature we read. But unlike the rest of the nonsense 
that littered my middle school experience, The Smiths’ still retains its 
uncanny sadness.
Morrissey himself has a knack for melancholy — even in his most 
up-tempo, danceable tracks, there is a pervasive gloom about the 
condition of being alive. The effects of this can be disastrous.
My friend Jen is least immune to Morrissey’s angst and has been 
known, on more than several occasions, to break down in the middle 
of doing anything and weep to the croon of Moz’s voice.
Hell, sometimes she would just break down at the thought of him old 
and sweaty, playing the Celebrity Showcase in Reno, Nev., changing 
his soggy T-shirts every 30 minutes and riding long black limousines 
for 200-foot stretches, realizing that no one would ever put up with 
that kind of shit from her.
No one would put up with that shit from me, either, which might make 
listening to The Smiths after a laborious first week of class even worse. 
There seems to be a sort of unfairness at play, but if poor Moz wasn’t 
always famous, at least he was always sad.
So if you’re feeling a bit worn and torn after a rough first week, I suggest 
you take comfort, curl up, revisit your old sad songs, and hope that 
you too will find great success in your wallowing.

Cozying up at the Elbow Room
Dig into some comfort food at this hangout
It’s always important to have a place to go where you feel 
like a regular. From the bar of the same name in Cheers to 
the Central Perk coffee shop in Friends, every neighborhood 
has a spot that feels like home. The Elbow Room, located in 
Shadyside, is a warm restaurant and bar that fits into this 
category.
Located on Ellsworth Avenue in Shadyside, the Elbow Room 
is a great place to take a date, friends, or even parents.
Celia Ludwinski I Assistant Photo Editor
The seating area in the restaurant reminds visitors of a pub 
with simple wooden tables and booths.
When it comes to the menu, you can expect typical American 
pub food. The menu includes a list of appetizers, salads, 
soups, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, and dinner plates that 
remind you of a homemade meal. The best things on the 
menu are the comfort foods.
The French onion soup is unbelievably delicious. Served in a 
crock, the cheese is overflowing, slightly crisped in the oven, 
and protecting the chunky onion soup below. On a recent 
visit, tomato-basil soup was offered as a special and it was 
also quite good. The pink broth, accented by large tomato 
chunks, was light-hearted, and the basil was distinctive 
without being overbearing.
Good chili is difficult for most people to agree on. The Elbow 
Room makes a superb effort with its Red Chili. Although it 
looks chunky, it is in fact very smooth in texture and in taste.
It had a bit of a spicy kick to it, just enough to add flavor. The 
chicken fingers are light and served with an amazing lemon 
mustard sauce. While chicken fingers are usually left to the 
appetizer or kids’ menu, they make a great dinner option 
alongside the French onion soup or the Red Chili.
The theme of comfort must run throughout this restaurant. 
Any item on the menu that looks the slightest bit 
overcomplicated usually is. One burger that will grab your eye, 
is the Johnny Apple burger. With brie, applewood-smoked 
bacon, and a slice of apple, it is a good restaurant burger. 
However, it is difficult to taste a distinctive flavor, and the
apple slice ends up adding texture but little else. The sweet 
potato fries were disappointing as they lacked any bit of crisp. 
A good rule to avoid this problem: keep it simple and stick to 
the comfort foods.
Besides a few overcomplicated dishes, there are few negative 
points. The restaurant is located near the corner of Ellsworth 
and Maryland, which means it is a trek for those without 
cars. If you do drive, expect to take five to 10 minutes to look 
for a parking spot. Aside from these shortfalls, everything 
else is pretty good. There is rarely a long wait to get a table 
and service is usually pretty quick. The wine list (if you’re 
interested and above 21) is solid and the happy hour is pretty 
good. There is also a loyalty rewards program that gives back 
to customers for eating there often.
You can impress a date with your knowledge of local 
restaurants by taking them to the Elbow Room (unless, of 
course, they’ve already read this article). It is moderately 
priced and the atmosphere is great. The Elbow Room makes 
you feel like a regular from the moment you walk in the door. 
This place only improves each time you visit as you get a 
sense of the menu. With time, this will become a favorite stop 
for a nice, relaxing meal.

The right cookware makes communal kitchens tasty
Tips on what to stock and what to drop
If you are going to gain the predicted “freshman 15” and keep 
it throughout your time at Carnegie Mellon, you might as 
well do it the right way. Aside from furnishing your dorm or 
apartment with furniture and personal touches, you also need 
to prepare your kitchen to provide for your hungry stomach 
and late-night snack sessions.
For students who have on-campus housing with a communal 
kitchen, the fundamental basics for eating at the desk are a 
mini-fridge, a microwave, a bowl, and some utensils. This 
is the bare minimum for survival. If you are a gastronomic 
minimalist, go for a shallow bowl,instead of a plate — a 
shallow bowl doubles as a plate and a bowl. Another quick 
tip: A medium-sized paring knife with a protective sheath is 
useful for cutting fruits at the desk.
For those who adore dessert, a glass liquid measuring cup 
with a handle is highly recommended. It comes in especially 
handy when mixing brownie mix out of the box, because 
instead of using up different bowls in the process, the mixing 
and baking can be done just in the measuring cup. Aside 
from being oven-, microwave1, refrigerator-, freezer-, and 
dishwasher-safe, a measuring cup can also double as a bowl 
with a handle for heating up oatmeal or ramen noodles in 
the microwave. The measuring cup tends to remain in the 
kitchen after moving off campus as well.
In an apartment kitchen, pots and pans become essential in 
order to completely utilize it. A pot and a pan would do just 
about anything from an Asian stir-fry to a winter stew. Again, 
for a gastronomic minimalist, go for a pot instead of a pan.
You can do a decent saute in a pot but you definitely cannot 
cook up chicken soup in a pan. For a more specialized job, a 
flat bottom cast iron skillet is amazing for steak, pancakes, 
and also baking cornbread. Cast iron cookware can hold more 
heat and does not change the temperature as fast as a pan.
Aside from basic pots and pans, I am a firm believer in a good 
knife. If you enjoy cooking, a knife allows you to manipulate 
vegetables, meat, and fruits to a greater level. Invest in only 
one good, six-to-eight-inch santoku or chef’s knife. It allows 
you to cut, slice, chop, and carve comfortably.
For the avid baker, an electric mixer is the gateway to 
heaven. KitchenAid provides reputable mixers, including 
both stand and handheld mixers. The key point to think about 
when buying a handheld electric mixer is its weight. For 
some recipes, you might need to hold the mixer for up to 10 
minutes. Find something that fits your price point and your 
bodily strength.
Most of the time, we go to stores like Macy’s and Target to get 
our dorm or apartment furnished. But we often forget about

same or even better quality cookware, along with other dorm 
furnishings, for lower prices.

Family issues, Japanese brides, and hook hands
Carnegie Mellon alum writes novella set in post-World War II Pittsburgh
If you’re looking for something to read but don’t want 
to be bogged down by thousand-page epics, Constance ¦ 
McCutch'eon’s Woman of the Baths might just be the answer.
A novella, Woman of the Baths takes place primarily in 
Pittsburgh after the end of World War II. Wagner Fike, a 
middle-aged member of one of the city’s richest families, 
finds himself in conflict with a decision made by his son, 
Ogden. Ogden, whose friendship with a younger man and 
disagreement with Wagner's beliefs set him at constant odds- 
with his father, has forged papers for the transfer of a young 
Japanese woman, Yukiko, out of her country and into the 
United States. Specifically, the papers allow Yukiko to remain 
at the Fikes’ residence under the guise of being a "bride” for 
Ogden’s friend, Ricky Virostik.
Initially, Ogden’s goal is twofold: First to confront his father 
about his support of the war, especially the brutality of its 
climax in Japan; and second to fulfill a promise to Virostik, 
an issue that remains elusive and is fleshed out more and 
more as the story progresses. Surprisingly, Wagner agrees 
and becomes caretaker to Yukiko, who will not utter a single 
word to anyone. Having been a victim of a fire-bombing raid, 
Yukiko lost both of her hands. Interestingly, Wagner begins to 
develop feelings for Yukiko as time goes on. As his own wife 
was recently deceased, Wagner comes to see Yukiko almost , 
as a replacement for her, a sentiment that irks Ogden to no 
end. Wagner arranges for prosthetic appendages to be made 
for her, hook-like extensions to her arms that can be covered
with a flesh-colored glove, but Yukiko prefers to wear the 
hooks bare.
Determined to offer Yukiko a place in his world, Wagner 
brings Yukiko to therapy sessions so that she can learn to use 
her new hands to perform more complex tasks. Gradually 
she gains in proficiency, and Wagner offers her a job as a 
custodian at a museum his family maintains. Perhaps what 
sets Wagner apart from his other American counterparts 
is the fact that when Yukiko starts to live in the public 
bathrooms, he allows her to. Unlike the rest of his family, who 
refer to her as "custodian of the toilets," Wagner makes her 
new position sound more sophisticated and European, calling 
her the “custodian of the baths.”
It is most interesting, as well, to note the dynamics between 
father and son in the novel. Ogden, who intends first of all to 
show his war-supporting father just how wrong his beliefs 
were, makes little effort to empathize with Yukiko or get to 
know her better as his father does. Instead, he acts on behalf 
of Virostik’s wishes, and is convinced that his father will 
become a better person on seeing first-hand the people that 
the war has wounded. At the beginning, Ogden seems a 
hero, and his father the heartless villain. By the novel’s close, 
though, McCutheon switches the two roles. Wagner becomes 
the one to truly see Yukiko’s humanity, and Ogden’s actions , 
on behalf of his friend turn out to have graver consequences.

Phoebe in Wonderland

Phoebe in Wonderland tells a 
delightful tale of a girl who dares to 
dream of everything she wants in 
life. Phoebe, played by Elle Fanning 
in her first lead role, is a 9-year-old 
girl who ultimately decides to seek a 
role in her school play. (Gee, can you 
guess what play they’re putting on?) 
Anyway, challenges are met, which 
are then overcome, all in a neat and 
well-packaged hour and a half. Much 
like Little Miss Sunshine, this movie 
is very good at making you feel good 
about life in general. Fun Fact: The 
first work on the script for this film 
began one year before Fanning was 
born.

Liam Neeson plays the most badass 
character of 2009 in this thriller about a 
retired CIA agent who is forced to pick 
up his gun again and brutally kill hordes 
of kidnappers, thieves, and foreigners 
in order to save his abducted 
17-year-old daughter who is now being 
traded as a slave in Paris. This is plainly 
a high-octane action flick — sporting 
the tagline “They took his daughter.
He’ll take their lives” — and Neeson, in 
full kick-ass mode, is perfect in every 
way.
Pink Floyd The Wall
Saturday, Sept. 5
8 10 12
Based on Pink Floyd’s eponymous 
album, The Wall is a highly entertaining 
flick that is driven by Pink Floyd’s 
music... duh. Championed as “one 
of the great modern musicals” by 
critic Roger Ebert, the film stars punk 
musician Bob Geldof as Pink, the 
protagonist, who is depicted at various 
points of development in his life. It was 
well-received initially, and the band itself 
has expressed satisfaction with the 
highly metaphorical movie, which also 
features many political cartoons that 
intertwine seamlessly within the picture. 
So, if you are still hung over from the 
awfulness that was Across the Universe, 
The Wall is definitely recommended.
Army of Darkness
Sunday, Sept. 6 
81012
In the third and final flick of director 
Sam Raimi’s Evil Dead trilogy, 
we find our hero, Ash, hilariously 
and wonderfully played by Bruce 
Campbell, transported back to the 
Middle Ages, where he must battle 
evil spirits in order to return home.
I mean, when a movie features 
one-liners like “That’s just pillow talk, 
baby” and “Hail to the king, baby,” 
how can seeing it not be a good 
idea? This trilogy has indeed gained a 
large cult following and is a fitting end 
to one of the most ghastly, yet always 
hilarious, movie trilogies ever to grace 
modern cinema.

Informative art: ideas to improve quality of life
New exhibit at Miller Gallery borders on future technology
The new exhibit at the Miller Gallery, curated by Andrea 
Grover, is a bit surreal, but very interesting. Its name comes 
from R. Buckminster Fuller’s book Nine Chains to the Moon, 
which is, as stated by the Miller Gallery website, based on 
“his radical proposal for improving the quality of life for all 
humankind via progressive design and maximization of the 
world’s finite resources."
The name of the book was derived from the fact that if all the 
people of the world cooperated with each other and stood on 
each other’s shoulders, then everyone could form nine chains 
to the moon. With the increase in population since then, the 
world can now, essentially complete 29 chains to the moon.
The exhibit is spread out over an entire floor of the gallery. 
One corner is called the Reading Room, complete with a sofa 
and a couple chairs where patrons can take time to digest the 
scene and read books on loan from Hunt Library that apply 
to the exhibit. There were titles on the shelves like Small is 
Beautiful and, of course, Fuller's book.
On the left wall, a monitor is set up playing a five-minute 
video on loop that describes Open_Sailing, an institution 
created by Cesar Harada and Hiromi Ozakiin. According 
to their website, 'opensailing.net, Open_Sailing “acts like a 
globally-conscious superorganism, a cluster of intelligent . 
units that can react to their environment, change shape and 
reconfigure themselves.”
There is also an impeccably-made scale model of the 
"International Ocean Station,” complète with a little man 
looking out to an imaginary sea. Below the monitor is a 
stand where flyers are stacked, saying that this “floating 
architecture” is a responsive and reactive habitat at sea. A 
team of 40 scientists have been developing this amoeba-like
marine prototype “composed of multiple dwellings, ocean 
farming modules, and a ... design that can expand and 
contract.” It is being assembled in the U.K., France, and 
Morocco.
The video discussed five items, first, Instinctive_Architecture, 
discussing the shape of this "floating laboratory.” Second, 
Nomadic_Ecosystem, noting how its live data feed monitors 
amounts of freshwater, energy, plankton, algae, as well as 
detecting favorable environments for relocation. Third, 
Swarm_Operating_System, a “distributed operating system 
that suggests a general safest location and a form for the 
overall structure ... in order to provide intelligent distribution 
of supplies, energy, and information." Fourth, it is an Energy_ 
Animal because it creates wind, solar, and wave power at all 
times. Finally, a Life_Cable, a sustainable wire that will pass 
energy, water, and data throughout the structure.
In .the final segment of the video, was a quote from Alan 
Kay saying, “The best way to predict our future is to invent 
it.” This is a poignant point when looking at these amazing 
futuristic designs that will revolutionize how we think about 
rigid infrastructure and metropolis.
The next artist to be featured was Mitchell Joachim, co­
founder of Terreform ONE, a nonprofit organization that 
promotes environment-friendly design in urban space. There 
is one storyboard, complete with smaller square images of 
projections of their island utopia. This part of the exhibit 
was the most futuristic, presenting pictures of cars, vehicles, 
workout centers, biodomes, and geodesic spheres.
The largest poster had modem visualizations of downtown 
Manhattan — a redesign of New York City complete with 
integrated structures that Would interact with the natural

vegetation and surrounding environment. This team had 
a vision for the future that would revolutionize the way we 
integrate ecological principles in an urban environment. More 
can be learned about their missions of sustainability and 
social justice at www.terieform.org.
Finally, Stephanie Smith’s piece is at the far right comer of 
the room, and can only be described as a commune circle.
She has built a six-foot-high oblong wooden structure, with' 
openings on either side. In the center of the shape is an 
eight-foot high PVC pipe supported by a tripod, and on the 
floor is a creamsicle-colored circle, with "I’M SHARING“ and 
“WE’RE COMMUNING" written in fuschia on either side.
The flyers on the structure call it a “kiosk" and say that it 
is meant for sharing items, info/resources, and communal 
experiences. The artist encourages anyone to "gather here, 
spontaneously or intentionally, for any reason and for any 
length of time.”
All these artists’ schemes for a fantastic feature were pretty 
interesting and I would certainly stroll through with some 
friends and see if you get inspired.

Annual Walnut Street art festival draws many visitors
It was an absolutely picturesque afternoon as couples and 
families strolled up and down Walnut Street admiring all the 
work at the art festival this past weekend.
Booths lined the center of the street, and food vendors selling 
sausages and freshly squeezed lemonade punctuated each 
block. Musicians also performed, playing pianos and steel 
pans, singing and selling CDs of their songs.
The booths were situated in the center of the street so that 
visitors could walk all the way up Walnut Street to South 
Neville Street and circle round and walk down to Centre 
Avenue.
Some booths were complete with a generator and 
sophisticated track lighting to highlight their pottery, 
paintings, or jewelry. There were mixed media pieces, 
wall hangings, lamps, hand-dyed scarves, purses, wallets, 
handmade clothing, leather goods, black-and-white 
photographs, landscapes, ironworks, giclee reproductions, 
acid etched metal... the list goes on.
Some artists took a relaxed approach, sitting in directors’ 
chairs on the sidewalk and letting people browse through 
their collections, while others were in their booths with their 
customers.
There were fused glass light switch plates, ornaments, vases, 
earrings, tableware, rugs, lamps, fine furniture and house 
accessories, ornate outdoor fountains, and even botanical 
collages on display.
Many artists’ work was eye-catching, with unique items on 
display. Janet Johnson painted poignant red poppies in acrylic 
onto large canvases. Lisa Aronzon displayed glass ornaments,
bowls, and hand-blown flowers.
Jimmy Langford came from Cumming, Ga. to show his 
copper, bronze, and brass sculptures. Leslie Reich had an 
interesting selection of wheel-thrown pottery, and her two 
sets of green and red bowls really stood out.
Rita Troller, an artist from Orland Park, HI., displayed a series of 
zinc and copper etchings. She had created an exquisite piece 
titled "A Pair,” an etching of two bright pears hanging from 
a tree, one colored chartreuse and the other lime. Jennifer 
Ardolino brought her watercolors from Crystal River, Fla.
Keith Ernest, an elderly jeweler, showed rosebud rings and 
necklaces attracted lots of attention.
Obayana B. Ajanaku constructed a booth of sterling silver,
14- and 18-carat gold, and mokume gane, that was simply 
astounding. He was one of the few artists actually making 
pieces on site, sitting quietly behind his work with his head 
down, but ready to answer any questions about his pieces.
Kimberly C. Anderson of Milkweed Ceramics made beautiful 
functional, figurative, and sculptural ceramic pieces. She 
highlighted her “Goddess Cups”: glasses, jars, pitchers', and 
even soap dispensers that mirrored the features of a female 
from the navel up.
Charles D’Onofrio brought handmade leather bags, from 
Danbury, Conn. It was interesting to compare his leather 
designs to those of the only other vendors with leather goods, 
and he clearly had the upper hand because of his superior 
hides, textures, and custom pulls that trumped the other 
artists’ formulaic totes and wallets. His wife told me that she 
picks the fabrics and that each piece is one of a kind, tttat she 
never has and never will make the same bag twice.
Some very interesting furniture was also on display. John 
Damratoski featured some amazing mixed media metal 
and wood chairs. A woodworker from Millmont, Pa., J.C. 
Sterling exhibited custom-designed hand-built furniture with 
traditional joinery and unique figures that he claimed would 
last for generations.
Jeff Laibson’s art was an abstract and impressionist 
interpretation of music featuring mangled music notes, 
crayola colors, and a jumble of jazz instruments. Scribbled in 
the corner of one of his pieces was “Play, rest, repeat.” This 
was a wonderfully fitting phrase for the day, good advice for 
the future, and a pretty mature mantra to have.

The Benjy Davis Project is a Louisiana-based rock band 
made up of five members, including none other than Benjy 
Davis, who does the lead vocals and acoustic and electric 
guitar; Mic Capdevielle on the drums, percussion, and vocals; 
Jonathan Lawhun on the electric lead guitar and banjo; Matt 
Rusnak on the bass guitar; and Michael Galasso taking on a 
few roles playing the piano, B3 organ, Wurlitzer, harmonica, 
and vocals. Davis formed the Benjy Davis Project in 2001 as a 
folk rock duo and transformed it into one of the most popular 
bands in Baton Rouge. The band recently released their latest 
album, Dust, which took them to a new high in their career. 
On the band's music page, Davis says that “these sessions 
were more raw, more real."
The album takes you from emotional points with “Still Sweet” 
and “Good Enough" to romantic points with songs like “I Love 
You.” The music is great to listen to during different times 
of the day and different states of the mind. The band takes 
its fans on a journey into their minds as they write from the 
soul, and with this album, the band feels that "they’ve fully 
arrived.” Dust is a great album to listen to when you want 
to listen to musical abilities take over and actually hear the 
music from the artist.
On a different note, the album Not as Far by Three Legged 
Fox is more of a pick-me-up album. Band members 
Kyle Wareham, Eric Weisenstein, Mike Brody, and Kory 
Kochersperger really deliver in this one. It’s the kind of music 
you play on the boom box when you are getting a tan on the 
beach as a Frisbee whizzes over your head and a barbecue 
grill is about 10 feet away from you with the smell of grilling 
burgers and dogs whiffing past your nose. This CD is a mix 
of flavors as it pulls together reggae beats and rock music 
to greate the perfect laid-back blend. “Away,” the second 
song on the album, really takes you away with its rhythmic 
and catchy tunes. This album is a great combination of so 
many ideas and thoughts that have been put together to be 
delivered to fans in a relaxed vibe. Lie back, close your eyes,
and listen to the album. You may just want to play it again.
The album also features guest appearances by Slightly 
Stoopid, members of G. Love & Special Sauce, and more.
The band’s reputation speaks for their album as they were 
voted #1 Best Rock Band in the 2008 Out & About Magazine 
Music Awards. The group was actually formed after winning 
the University of Delaware's 2006 Battle of the Bands. Three 
Legged Fox has received great reviews.
Priscilla Renea: In one word, "Yes!” She began her music 
career by posting her music on YouTube and surprised herself 
when her fan base turned into thousands. Just hearing a taste 
of her music puts you in a lighter mood. "Hello My Apple” is a 
great song for those who love to hear when their “apple” just 
calls to say hello. It’s not a mushy song that makes you want 
to change the station but, rather, it’s just enough to get the 
point across. “I Fell In Love” picks up the pace as she shares 
with listeners her experience with romance. She fell in love 
and it is easy to see why fans fell in love with her music. Look 
forward to hearing more from this up and coming artist.
Her music stems from the many experiences she has been 
through as the child of a naval officer. It led to her writing 
poetry, prose, and song which she did because there “wasn't 
anything on the radio that I wanted to hear.” Her music has 
already been featured in ad campaigns and she has been 
featured in Giant magazine for her fashion sense. Renea is 
coming through various media and we can expect to see her 
debut album on Oct. 20. Her music is available on YouTube.

vivian girls.
Brooklyn-based trio Vivian Girls performed at the Andy Warhol 
Museum last Thursday. Pictured above is Cassie Ramone, the band's 
lead guitarist. The other two members, Kickball Katy and Ali Koehler, 
play both bass and drums. All members take their turn at vocals. The 
band's music takes its influences from popular bands like Nirvana and 
The Shangri:Las and has a pretty large fan base.
