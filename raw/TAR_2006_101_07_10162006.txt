University takes a stand 
against using sweatshops
by Claire Morgenstern
Assistant News Editor
Pittsburgh’s anti-sweatshop 
groups held a public hearing 
at a City Council meeting last 
Wednesday to enforce the city’s 
anti-sweatshop ordinance. For 
support, activists looked to 
Carnegie Mellon, whose licens­
ing coordinator, Jay Marano, has 
held such regulations for univer­
sity merchandise firmly in place 
for the last decade.
The hearing was the most 
public announcement of new de­
velopments in the way activists 
want the ordinance, originally 
passed in 1997, to be imple­
mented in Pittsburgh. Activists 
have found a new poster child 
for their cause: the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. Local activists and base­
ball fans alike have been peti­
tioning the Pirates to stop the
use of sweatshop labor in the 
production of apparel featuring 
the team’s logo.
“Baseball is the best at mak­
ing money from their logo,” said 
Kenneth Miller, a Pittsburgh na­
tive and co-founder of the cam­
paign targeting the Pirates.
Colleges aren’t bad at turn­
ing a profit either: According to 
Miller, the same sweatshops that 
produce Pirates apparel are also 
making collegiate apparel for 
universities across the country 
— but not Carnegie Mellon. The 
university is one of more than 
175 colleges and universities, 
including Pittsburgh’s Duquesne 
University, who are members of 
the Workers Rights Consortium 
(WRC), a group committed to 
the public disclosure of factory 
locations where illegal sweat­
shop labor may be being used.

European Parliament 
members speak at Pitt
by Matthew E. Campbell
Assistant Copy Manager
European Parliament mem­
bers Graf Alexander Lambsdorff 
of Germany and Antonyia Par- 
vanova of Bulgaria spoke about 
foreign affairs at the University 
of Pittsburgh’s European Union 
Center of Excellence on Tuesday.
Lambsdorff, a former mem­
ber of the German Foreign Of­
fice, serves on the delegation for 
United States relations and is a 
substitute on the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs. Parvanova, only 
an observer until Bulgaria offi­
cially enters the European Union 
in January, is involved with the 
environment, public health, and 
food safety committee.
Pitt’s EU center is one of 10 
centers in the U.S. funded by the 
European Commission.
The European Parliament is 
the only EU institution whose 
members are elected. The EU’s 
457 million citizens are repre­
sented by 732 members of Parlia­
ment, according to the EU’s web­
site. There are seven political 
parties within the parliament; 
Lambsdorff and Parvanova are 
in the Alliance of Democrats and 
Liberals for Europe (ALDE), the 
third-largest party.
According to Lambsdorff, the 
party supports economic liberal­
ization and closer integration as 
well as a constitution.
Lambsdorff said there is 
“broad agreement” between 
the EU and the U.S. on terror­
ism, a “transatlantic issue,” and
nuclear proliferation. He said 
President Bush has tried to re­
build ties with the EU after fall­
ing out over Iraq. Lambsdorff 
also pointed out initiatives that 
the EU has taken on the world 
stage, such as leading negotia­
tions with Iran over its nuclear 
programs.
Parvanova discussed Bulgar­
ia’s tough 10-year process of 
joining the EU. The country had 
to make many reforms, she said, 
and it is behind on environmen­
tal issues. Bulgaria was also 
forced to close some niiclear 
power plants, which hurt the 
country’s economy. There are 
also concerns about the volume 
of crime and money laundering.
Parvanova, a pediatrician, is 
interested in health care in the 
EU. She supported a proposal 
for European citizens to have 
free choice of health care across 
the EU. ALDE is also working on 
a bill of rights for patients.
Both speakers addressed au­
dience questions. Lambsdorff 
agreed that the EU has a “demo­
cratic deficit,” calling EU poli­
tics “opaque” and “hard for the 
average citizen to follow.”
Enlargement — adding new 
members to the EU — is a con­
tentious issue. Turkey’s efforts 
to join the democratic, primar­
ily Christian EU have been 
blocked.
Lambsdorff feels that, for the 
EU to succeed, there needs to be 
an EU public with a European 
identity. He said he is opposed 
to Turkey joining for “demo­
cratic and financial reasons.”
Heinz review journal examines health care issues
by James Tetlow
Staffwriter
Every publication has to start 
sometime.
For the Heinz School Review 
(HSR), that start was in fall 2003, 
when six students came up with 
the idea to create an online pol­
icy journal for the Heinz School 
of Public Policy and Management 
as part of their “systems synthe­
sis” project. Now in its third year, 
the HSR has grown to 15 staff
members and has just released 
its fifth issue, which focuses on 
global health care issues.
According to Robert Gutier­
rez, the editor-in-chief of the 
HSR and a master’s student in 
public policy and management, 
this issue comes at an important 
time for health care in the United 
States.
“The nation is still wrestling 
with many of these difficult is­
sues,” Gutierrez stated. “Ulti­
mately, it comes down to looking 
out for the well-being of its citi­
zens, which I’d say is a basic hu­
man right.”
The issue focuses on a wide 
range of topics, including cross- 
border health care between the 
United States and Mexico, AIDS/ 
HIV prevention, price controls on 
pharmaceutical drugs, and men­
tal health parity implications.
“It’s a global issue as well,” said 
Deepti Gudipati, an editor for the 
HSR and a master’s student in 
public policy and management. 
“You see a gap between the rich 
and the poor, the urban and the
rural, in all countries.”
Anyone interested in an 
issue’s topic can submit an ar­
ticle, though the most common 
contributors are still Heinz fac­
ulty and students. The HSR staff 
has been trying to network with 
other existing policy journals, 
including The Public Record, a 
journal published by the Lyndon 
B. Johnson School of Public Af­
fairs at the University of Texas at 
Austin. The HSR is also planning

Magazine puts university on 
‘probation’ for physical fitness
by Alexander Dileonardo
Junior Staffwriter
Students at 
Mellon are used to 
receiving a pat on 
the back from media 
publications. But this 
month’s issue of Men’s Fit­
ness magazine put Carnegie 
Mellon on “academic proba­
tion.”
The issue, which contains its 
annual list of the 25 fittest col­
leges, evaluated schools based on 
student surveys about diet and 
exercise, availability of healthy 
food, and the quality of fitness 
facilities on campus.
Carnegie Mellon was among 
the eight most underachieving 
schools in fitness, according to 
the publication.
Fellow Pennsylvania school 
Dickinson College attained the 
status of most fit college. Neal 
Boulton, editor-in-chief of Men’s 
Fitness, believes that Dickinson’s balanced 
approach to campus fitness is what sets it 
apart from all the rest.
According to Boulton, students who are 
serious about fitness as well as those who 
only occasionally exercise could find ev­
erything to meet their needs at Dickin­
son.
“They provide a very balanced life­
style within which anyone could exist, 
whether they’re kind of cheating a little 
or in a fitness mode,” he said in an October 
3 USA Today article.
Susan Bassett, director of athletics for 
Carnegie Mellon, was surprised that 
Carnegie Mellon scored so low.
“I think the portrayal is a little 
unfair,” she said. “I don’t

Stress levels feed unhealthy 
eating habits
by Karin Xie
Junior Staffwriter
With a poor dining and exer­
cising regimen, Carnegie Mellon 
students are sitting at the bot­
tom of the fitness grading curve, 
according to Men’s Fitness.
In addition, the campus was 
ranked seventh in the Princ­
eton Review’s “Their Students 
Never Stop Studying” category, 
suggesting that the campus 
community’s stress level have 
some connection to students’ 
eating habits.
In a study carried out by the In­
stitute of Psychological Sciences 
at the University of Leeds in the 
UK from 2003 to 2005, research­
ers found that a high stress level 
is associated with fluctuation 
in food intake levels, as well as 
changes in food choices and eat­
ing patterns.
“Some people will want to eat
more, and some people’s appe­
tites will completely disappear,” 
said Paula Martin, a registered 
dietician who works with Stu­
dent Health Services. “We are 
especially concerned about stu­
dents who avoid eating when 
they get stressed.”
According to Martin, a lack 
of caloric intake hinders cogni­
tive abilities like memory, leads 
to unhealthy weight loss, and 
drastically weakens the immune 
system.
An individual who eats more 
when stressed tends to eat 
quickly, without experiencing 
the food. A distracted multi­
tasker usually overeats since he 
or she is disconnected with the 
feeling of hunger and fullness.
The study also narrowed down 
groups of people whose diets 
make them vulnerable in stress­
ful situations, including dieters,

This week’s lectures to discuss sex, gender, and war
by Brittany McCandless
News Editor
Two of this week’s lectures fo­
cus on sex and sexuality, while 
three others will discuss inter­
national events, particularly in 
regard to world media.
Title: “Family Pleasures:
Incest and Desire Among the 
Edwardian Middle Class”
The Basics: Lisa Z. Sigel is a 
member of the history depart­
ment at DePaul University and 
author of Governing Pleasures: 
Sexuality and Social Change in 
Britain, 1815-1914. Her lecture 
involves the Punishment of 
Incest Act for England and Wales 
that the British Parliament 
passed in 1908. While the
bill seemed obvious, the curi­
ous aspect of the act was the 
failed attempts to pass similiar 
legistation. Furthermore, con­
tinued arguments in Parliament 
against the bill demonstrated, 
as Sigel argues, cultural ambiv­
alence toward state regulation 
of familial sexuality.
When: Today at 4:30 p.m.
Where: Swank Room, Baker 
Hall 255B
Title: “Self-Made Man: One 
Woman’s Journey into Manhood 
and Back Again”
The Basics: Norah Vincent, 
a former Los Angeles Times op­
ed columnist, spent 18 months 
in male disguise to get a first­
hand account of how the other 
gender lives. She dressed as a 
man, glued bits of stubble to her
jaw, joined an all-male bowling 
league, went to strip clubs, and 
even went on dates to under­
stand the difference between 
the sexes.
When: Tuesday from 6 to 
7:30 p.m.
Where: Pake Room, Univer­
sity Center
Title: “After Iraq and Leb­
anon: Rethinking the Relevance

Homecoming marks 
Tartan centennial
Un
Bradford Yankiver
In 1906, thousands of workers were 
moving earth to create the Panama 
Canal, the world’s first feature-length 
film was released, and the founding 
members of the nation’s first African- 
American fraternity were preparing to 
officially found Alpha Phi Alpha. Here 
in Pittsburgh, in October of that year, 
The Tartan published its first issue.
Next week, The Tartan will officially 
turn 100 years old. In the last century, 
hundreds of students have dedicated 
hundreds of thousands of hours to pub­
lishing this newspaper for the students 
of Carnegie Mellon University. That’s 
never meant more to me than it does 
now after this past Homecoming.
To mark our centennial, current and 
former members of The Tartan gath­
ered this past weekend to celebrate and 
reflect. The occasion was not only an op­
portunity to proudly look back, but also 
a chance to find our place in the lineage 
of Tartan editors. Tartan alumni from 
as long ago as 1941 joined us Saturday, 
and even more sent letters document­
ing their memories.
To meet the people who performed 
our jobs before we were born puts our 
work in perspective. It’s hard to believe 
that a hundred or more people held our 
roles before us.
In meeting the many Tartan alumni 
who returned, I expected to learn about 
eras in our publication’s history that 
would seen totally foreign to me. In the 
days before our gathering, I wondered 
about how different it would have been 
to work at this newspaper 20, 35, or 40 
years ago.
In fact, even'graduates from as re­
cently as 10 years ago gape at the sight 
of our current office, which is laden 
with pixels instead of paper.
After hearing stories of former staff 
members, Marshall Roy, our Forum edi­
tor, noted that in our current process, no 
part of the newspaper is actually on pa­
per until it is in the final stages of copy 
editing. The work done in our comput­
erized office presents a great contrast to 
the labors of our predecessors.
The Tartan has been created by means 
of linotype machines creating molds 
from molten lead, by pasting columns 
of text (reprinted and re-pasted with 
each correction) and photographs onto 
pasteboards to be photographed and 
chemically etched onto metal plates 
used to transfer ink to paper, and now 
modern desktop publishing.
While we all marveled at the techno­
logical differences, I was surprised — 
though, in retrospect, I shouldn’t have 
been — to find that technology is where 
the major distinctions ended.
We’d all faced the same challenges 
and triumphs: chasing down the big 
stories, butting heads with “the admin­
istration,” finding and keeping a dedi­
cated staff of workers, goofing up and 
pulling issues off the stands. We found 
great kinship in our experiences.
While I’ve known that The Tartan 
would affect the course of my life, I was 
impressed by the extent to which that’s 
true for many other members of The 
Tartan’s staff. In one e-mail, a former 
Tartan columnist wrote, “I merely have 
The Tartan to thank for my career and 
marriage and first book.”
Meeting so many wonderful and im­
pressive alumni of The Tartan makes 
me prouder than I’ve ever been to be a 
part of this organization. Not only do I 
feel that we are living up to a great tra­
dition, but I see that we’re contributing 
to one that will change the lives of many 
Tartan staff members yet to come.
As I listened to the stories of our 
guests, I felt that I was listening to dif­
ferent translations of a single story. It 
is clear to me now that today’s Tartan 
stands on. the shoulders of its history.
To every member of The Tartan’s 
staff, past and present, thank you.
Brad L. Yankiver, publisher of The Tartan, 
welcomes all responsible questions and

Heinz School’s online journal reviews 
health care, takes national submissions
“Public policy is really about 
keeping things ‘public,’” Gutier­
rez stated. “So we try to follow 
that maxim.”
While the first few issues 
were a “hodge-podge” of policy 
papers, the current format has 
changed.
“The last three issues have 
been dedicated to what we con­
sider critical policy issues,” fac­
ulty advisor and professor of po­
litical science and international 
relations Silvia Borzutzky stated. 
“And since the Heinz School has 
a health care management pro­
gram, it made a lot of sense for 
us to focus on health care.” 
Previous issues of the journal 
have dealt with subjects such as 
Pittsburgh development issues, 
feminism, and globalization.
Editors are still considering fu­
ture topics, including technology 
in policy and relations between 
Latin America and the United 
States.

Homecoming Chili Cook-Off
Kika Turner, a third-year architecture student, waits to receive chili at the Third Annual Chili Cook-Off Saturday 
afternoon in the courtyard between the UC and West Wing. Organized by the Carnegie Clan and sponsored by 
Student Activities and the Student Alumni Relations Council, many student groups on campus entered a pot of 
their best chili to be sampled by Homecoming attendees and judged by a panel of campus employees. .
REVIEW, from A1
to send representatives to na­
tional policy conferences to raise 
awareness of the journal.
In addition to editing a piece 
on pharmaceutical price con­
trols by a group of students at the 
University of Chicago, Gutipati 
also submitted a paper on health 
care in rural India. Her piece fo­
cuses on the rural-urban divide 
in India and how globalization 
has affected the traditional Sid- 
dha healers in rural India as they 
compete with and work along­
side modern doctors.
“There’s a very international 
population at Heinz, and a lot of 
people are from developing na­
tions,” Gutipati said. “Even for 
people who might not have had 
experience with rural areas and 
developing nations, this might 
provide some food for thought.”
In addition to articles by Heinz 
students and faculty, there are 
two interviews with profession­
als in health care — one' with
Karen Feinstein, president of the 
Jewish Healthcare Foundation 
in Pittsburgh, and another with 
Jonathan Gruber, a professor of 
economics at MIT who worked 
on the “universal” Massachusetts 
health insurance coverage plan.
“The journal is aiming to be an 
electronic version of The Econo­
mist and less like a traditional 
academic print journal,” stated 
Genevieve Nolan, an editor and 
master’s student in public policy 
and management. “The goal is to 
fill a niche that to date has been 
left void.”
Typically, the HSR has four to 
six policy papers devoted to a 
broad range of subjects within 
a general theme, an interview 
with a professional in the rel­
evant field, several short policy 
memos, and a book review. Since 
the journal’s readership is mostly 
Heinz students and faculty, the 
journal was initially designed 
for them, though as the journal’s 
audience has increased, so has 
its accessibility.
University takes a stand against buying merchandise from sweatshops
of Pittsburgh, unlike Carnegie 
Mellon and Duquesne, is not a 
member of the WRC. Pitt stu­
dents who tried to get the univer­
sity to take action a few years ago 
were treated badly by the school’s 
administration, Miller said.
Wednesday’s meeting was led 
by Miller and Jon Hunt, a Pitt 
alumnus and national coodinator 
of the Campaign for Labor Rights, 
based in Washington, D.C.
Hunt, who also serves on the 
board of SweatFree Communi­
ties, spoke about why positive 
relationships with sweatshops 
are so hard to maintain. As soon 
as they find out they may be the 
subject of a human rights inves­
tigation, “companies have a ten­
dency to cut and run,” he said.
Miller said the United States 
can use its buying power to 
change this.
“We can say, ‘If you’re going 
to do business here, you have to 
tell us where the factories are lo­
cated,’ ” he said.
Members agreed that Pitts­
burgh was an appropriate place 
to start the campaign.
“Pittsburgh has a history of in­

committed to promoting African 
issues in America and influenc­

The activists are hoping to get 
the support of local colleges and

So far, institutions have been re­
sistant. Miller said that Marano 
was not present at last Wednes­
day’s hearing because of political 
reasons, but would not say what 
they were.
Marano confirmed that he did 
not participate in this week’s 
hearing via an e-mail statement.
Neither Marano nor his super­
visor, Vice-President and Gen­

available for comment.

Marano is the university’s 
voting liason to the WRC. In 
May 2005, he was elected to 
the WRC’s board of directors as 
the representative of University 
Caucus — schools with small or 
nonexistent campus trademark 
licensing programs. The univer­
sity has been affiliated with the 
WRC since 2002.
Since 1998, Carnegie Mellon’s 
President’s Council for the Of­
ficial Policy for Use of Carnegie 
Mellon Trademarks has required 
all merchandise bearing the 
Carnegie Mellon trademark to 
be purchased only from trade­
mark licensed suppliers, even 
merchandise purchased for non­
retail internal distribution and 
use.
In 2002 the President’s Coun­
cil approved the Carnegie Mellon 
University Code of Workplace 
Conduct for Trademark Licens­
ees.
“Carnegie Mellon condemns
the use of sweatshop labor in the 
manufacturing of any product 
that bears the trademarks of this 
institution,” the document states 
in its introduction. Subsequent 
pages provide stipulations for 
protecting human rights, as well 
as the safety, wages, and hours, 
of licensees’ employees.
Now, the Pittsburgh chapters 
of several anti-sweatshop activ­
ist groups, including United Stu­
dents Against Sweatshops and 
Sweatfree Communities, want 
to re-focus attention on the 1997 
anti-sweatshop ordinance by 
persuading the Pirates to adopt 
the same standards that univer­
sities nationwide have.
“Anti-sweatshop legislation ex­
ists, but it’s not being adequately 
implemented anywhere,” Miller 
said. “If the Pirates do it, then the 
rest of the league will follow.” 
Last Wednesday night, activ­
ists met to discuss the next steps 
to improve the relationship be­
tween Pittsburgh and the global 
apparel industry. The University

Students’ high stress levels lead to irregular; unhealthy eating habits
that she is a self-proclaimed per­
fectionist. “So it’s not just CMU’s 
workload; it has a lot to do with 
us, too.”
Kucherer’s perfectionist ten­
dencies might make her more 
prone to snacking. According 
to an article published in Stress 
and Health, the journal of the 
International Society for the 
Investigation of Stress, perfec­
tionists’ preferences shift to 
high-calorie foods when they are 
stressed.
The UK study found that fe­
males prefer foods high in sugar 
and fat — including chocolate 
and ice cream—while males tend 
to have less of a sweet tooth, in­
dulging instead in high-fat, high- 
fiber, and low-quality foods 
such as potato chips and french 
fries.
“I eat junk food when I’m busy 
and I can’t really sit down and eat 
something healthy, which usu­
ally takes time to make or even 
find around here,” said Daniel 
Lee, a senior in business admin­
intricately related parts such as 
sleep, activity level, interper­
sonal relationships, and relation­
ship with yourself,” Beyer said. 
“You have to pay equal attention 
to all these aspects when dealing 
with stress.” •
Beyer identified the indepen­
dence of college life as a major 
psychological stressor. For most 
first-years as well as some up­
perclassmen, the freedom is 
overwhelming. Students are of­
ten sleep-deprived because they 
think they can “steal free time 
from their sleep,” he said.
“Students tend to think they 
are not like everyone else,” Mar­
tin said. “It is like a bragging right 
to function without sleep, but it 
does catch up with you.”
Beyer expressed similar con­
cerns, noting that long-term 
sleep deprivation could lead to 
decreased productivity and over­
all alertness, as well as emotional 
issues.
“Be mindful of what you are 
doing to your body in all regions
istration.
Although Lee observes stress- 
induced changes in his eating 
habits, he does not entirely blame 
his workload for the momentary 
change. He said he only eats junk 
food on “special occasions,” such 
as when he crams for an exam.
According to Jeff Beyer in 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services, students under stress 
will go for the first thing that is 
available to them.
“It’s gotta be right there,” Beyer 
said. “The food is only consumed 
as a distraction, and students 
will keep on snacking because 
they want to repeat that moment 
of high.”
The reason that stressed stu­
dents picks greasy foods could 
be that they are emotionally 
malnourished, lacking sleep, not 
exercising, or socially isolated. 
Seeking to take control of the sit­
uation, they will likely keep eat­
ing although the food will make 
them feel worse.
“Food is one aspect of many
emotional eaters who eat to feel 
better, external eaters who eat 
without intuiting fullness, and 
chronic overeaters.
Aside from these traits, stress- 
induced snacking seems to affect 
females much more than males. 
In a high-stress situation, such 
as the exam-preparation period, 
researchers believe that female 
students will eat sugary and fat­
tening snacks significantly more 
frequently than male students.
“Chocolate — I have to treat 
myself to chocolate when I’m 
stressed just to make myself feel 
better about the situation,” said 
sophomore psychology major 
Shelly Kucherer.
Kucherer indulges in the sweet 
fix when her stress meter sky­
rockets, but she does not blame 
the organic chemistry or physics 
exam for her snacking habits.
“Let’s be honest. We are at 
CMU. We are all a little bit of 
overachievers,” she said, adding

A study has linked stress to poor dining habits.

ward healthy food, quality sleep, care of yourself, the more likely
and good social relationships,” you’ll feel at your best.”

think what we offer is completely 
adequate, but we’ve been proac­
tive.”
Though she has only worked 
for the university for a year, 
Bassett thinks the athletics de­
partment has made noticeable 
changes to Carnegie Mellon’s fit­
ness initiative.
“I think Carnegie Mellon is on 
the right track,” she said, citing 
the new gym in Resnik, new car- 
dio equipment in the residence 
halls, and a new leasing program 
for equipment.
Under the leasing program, a 
third party owns and maintains 
all equipment and helps keep
work out facilities in good condi­
tion
Bassett looks to the future for 
even greater changes in Carnegie 
Mellon’s fitness program. The 
university is planning to build 
a new gym that would include 
a climbing wall, a 1500-square- 
foot fitness center three times 
the size ofWiegand Gym, several 
multipurpose rooms for aerobics 
and instruction, and an arena 
specifically for basketball and 
volleyball,
The building will also incorpo­
rate the health and wellness cen­
ter currently located in a dugout 
next to the track.
“This would allow us to col­
laborate and be a leader in this 
area,” Basset said.
The athletic department has 
consulted with an architecture 
firm to come up with the initial 
plans for the gym. Bassett and 
her peers presented the plans 
to the dean, but construction is 
not expected to begin for several 
years.
“Nobody is opposed to the new 
gym. It’s just a matter of priori­
ties,” Bassett said. “We have the 
Gates Center and classrooms that 
need to be renovated first.”
Beyond athletic facilities, 
the Men’s Fitness article ranked 
schools based on other aspects. 
Dickinson, for example, requires 
students to take at least four se­
mesters of physical education.
Bassett does not think the uni­
versity should incorporate man­
datory physical education pro­
grams into its curriculum.
\ “Our physical education range 
is appropriate for our academic 
profile,” she said.
Jeanette Schilling, a sopho­
more policy and management 
major and member of the wom­
en’s basketball team, thinks it is 
the rigorous academic life keep­
ing students from the gym.
“The student body is less fo­
cused on fitness because we have 
a lot of work,” she said, “but there 
still are a few of us who work out 
on a daily basis.”
Students at other rigorous and 
technically focused schools share 
Schilling’s outlook. Students at 
Case Western Reserve University 
in Cleveland agree with observa­
tions made by Carnegie Mellon 
students about campus fitness.
Liz Zheng, a senior at Case, 
thinks intense academic pro­
grams keep students out of the 
gym.
“I don’t think that the student 
body at Case is in shape,” she 
said. “Most people are stressed 
out and too busy to work out. 
Sleeping and pizza is a lot more 
comforting.”
Zheng also thinks technically 
focused universities produce 
similarly-focused students who 
“probably think that their grades 
or getting [an internship] is more 
important than lifting weights.” 
Joanna Hawley, a senior design 
major, thinks that the high-stress 
environment actually promotes
working out.
“Everyone is so stressed out 
that a lot of people I knowjust try 
to burn off the stress by working 
out,” she said.
Still, Hawley feels that the ath­
letic facilities could use some im­
provement.
“The facilities are adequate in 
some places,” she said. “I defi­
nitely think the [University Cen­
ter] and Skibo facilities should be 
bigger, because they are more of 
a hub for working out.”
The majority of the other 
schools on the list are small lib­
eral arts colleges. Virginia Tech 
is the only technically focused 
school with a large Division I 
athletics program that makes the 
cut.

Pop science

Spectacular

Assistant Pillbox Editor
Scientists have finally dis­
covered a remedy for the an­
noyances of Pittsburgh traffic. 
Soothing LCD displays, pre­
programmed fragrances, and 
vibrations in the driver’s seat 
are only a few of the ways in 
which Bayer MaterialScience 
and Rinspeed’s new concept 
car is designed to respond to 
the mood of its user.
The product, called the Senso 
Car, is set up to monitor the 
conduct and pulse of its driver. 
Reacting to emotions including 
anger and fatigue, the Senso 
Car in turn alters its environ­
ment, even playing music de­
signed to promote tranquility 
and awareness. All those “No 
Turn On Red” signs don’t stand 
a chance.
The Senso Car is only one of 
the many attractions featured 
in this year’s SciTech Spec­
tacular, a 10-day celebration 
of technology and invention 
located at the Carnegie Science 
Center.
Formerly the SciTech Festi­
val, the seven-year-old event 
opened this past Friday and will 
last through Sunday. This is the 
Spectacular’s second year un­
der its new name, which came 
with a lot of other changes.
Until 2005, the science cen­
ter held its SciTech Festival in 
the spring to correspond with 
the Pittsburgh Regional Sci­
ence & Engineering Fair, a 68- 
year-old contest for middle and 
high school students. The sci­
ence fair remains in March, but 
that doesn’t mean it’s lost touch 
with the Spectacular.

The next time you need to 
do an Internet search, Clusty. 
com may become your first 
choice, thanks to a new feature 
that other search engines don’t 
have.
Like its competitor search 
engines, Clusty searches the 
Internet using the terms a user 
supplies.
But unlike its competitors, it 
returns a set of “clusters” on the 
left side of the search results. 
The clusters act as a set of top­
ics associated with the search 
words.
Now, bloggers and webmas­
ters can bring the convenience 
of clusters to their own sites via 
the Clusty Cloud, a tool that can 
be placed on a web page. The 
cloud is produced from a query 
on a relevant subject. For in­
stance, if a blogger writes about 
robotics, he or she can place 
a cloud on the blogspace that 
groups results into categories 
like “Automation,” “Research,” 
and “Robotics Society.”
A user can click on these top­
ics for an in-depth look of the 
results. A search for “Carnegie 
Mellon,” for example, returns 
“Science,” • “Pittsburgh,” and 
“Carnegie Mellon School” as 
the first three clusters.
Users can click on each clus­
ter to choose from even more 
search categories and narrow 
the search criteria even further.
The idea is to help users nar­
row down their search results 
to relevant categories in order

Carnegie Mellon alums create way to track buses by phone
Alan Gerber/Photo Staff
by Michael M. Whiston
Assistant Science & Technology Editor
Students can now plan trips around 
the area more easily, thanks to the 
development of a new interactive 
voice-response phone system by three 
Carnegie Mellon alumni.
Lawrence Lee and Amit Agarwal, 
who both received bachelor’s degrees 
in computer science, and Vishal Chor- 
dia, who received a master’s degree in 
electrical and computer engineering, 
recently developed a phone system that 
provides updated schedules for buses 
destined for Squirrel Hill, Oakland, and 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus.
By calling 1-866-MyCMUBus, a per­
son can speak with an automated op­
erator. The operator first asks about 
the person’s current location and gives 
the option of saying “Carnegie Mellon,” 
“Oakland,” or “Squirrel Hill.” The op­
erator then asks for the caller’s destina­
tion.
The system then provides bus arrival 
times for buses headed in that direction 
within the next 30 minutes.
If you tell the operator that you are 
in Oakland or Squirrel Hill, you will 
automatically be given arrival times 
for buses heading to campus. If you tell 
the operator that you are on campus, 
you can receive arrival times for buses 
headed to Oakland or Squirrel Hill.
But with the Port Authority posting 
schedules online already, why choose to 
provide such a service?
“I’m giving back something to my 
school, which gave me so much,” Chor- 
dia said.
Chordia said that he could remember 
coming from India and feeling very con­
fused in the big city. Now, he said, he 
is trying to solve a problem that he does 
not want others to face.
“I wish someone had done that for 
me,” he said.
Lee said that the bus phone sys­
tem is designed to both help students 
and support the business for which all 
three Carnegie Mellon graduates work, 
Angel.com.
Lee said, “We thought that it would be 
a great way to bring Angel to campus as 
well as give back to the campus at the 
same time.”
Angel.com is a company that develops 
interactive voice response (IVR) tech­
nology. IVR allows customers to inter­
act with an information database via a 
touchtone phone.
MyCMUBus is managed over the An­
gel.com website. Lee said that more and 
more businesses are taking advantage 
of this website because of its cheap and 
easy use.
Currently, KB Toys offers callers the 
ability to find store locations and check 
the stock of popular items. Other cur­
rent companies include Reebok, Jiffy 
Lube, and Buca di Beppo.
Over 1600 other businesses have
joined, too. “What Angel really gives 
you is the ability to create these things 
within minutes to a day or two,” Lee 
said.
He said that without any additional 
purchase of software or hardware, many 
businesses that were previously unable 
to use these services due to maintenance 
costs are now able to do so.
Lee also said that Angel provides lots 
of control over the phone system. Lee 
chose Angel to host their bus informa­
tion phone service.
The system also features bus data for 
a bus lookup, which is a customized ap­
plication that Lee designed to pull up­
dated bus schedules from an informa­
tion database.
“It really provides a lot of functional­
ity,” Lee said. “It’s very exciting because 
the needs for these applications are 
growing.”
Chordia, who was responsible for the 
project’s business development, said 
that his goal was to make MyCMUBus as 
user-friendly as possible, which meant 
making it as simple as possible. For in­
stance, the service does not provide in­
dividual bus numbers to callers, he said, 
because this information is not impor­
tant.
“Anything that is simple and straight­
forward is much more valuable than 
having a number of things confusing 
students, making them wait for a long 
time,” said Chordia.
Although individuals can view com­
plete bus schedules online, Lee said that 
it is inconvenient to check these times 
over the Internet.
He said that students who need up­
dated information on the spot are prob­
ably headed into Squirrel Hill or Oak­
land in the first place.
“Something like this just makes logi­
cal sense to us,” said Lee.
At the same time, Lee said that the 
system can be improved in a couple of 
ways.
Firstly, the service could provide 
schedules for others areas besides Squir­
rel Hill and Oakland. It can also be im­
proved by becoming officially affiliated 
with the public transit system.
“We could really bring the project out 
... and provide much better service,” 
said Lee.
Chordia agrees that the project’s next 
step is to provide bus times to other 
destinations, including the Waterfront, 
Shadyside, Century III Mall, and the 
Strip District. “These are the places 
most students go,” Chordia said.
In order to expand the platform, how­
ever, people must use the service. With 
the help of professors, the team of grad­
uate students has sent out e-mails to stu­
dents and received a response of at least 
1000 callers so far.
Chordia said that it is up to the stu­
dents to use the service.
As for students waiting a long time for 
a bus, “If it’s a problem, people will use 
it,” he said.

$1 million grant gives science center 
planetary possibilities, Buhl Digital Dome
by Albert Lin
Staffwriter 
& Sarah Mogin
Assistant Pillbox Editor
High definition isn’t just for 
televisions anymore. The in­
creased picture quality has 
slowly been creeping into other 
applications. The Carnegie Sci­
ence Center recently upgraded
its planetarium projection sys­
tem to a high-definition system.
The planetarium was founded 
in 1939 and has been sponsored 
by the Buhl Foundation since its 
absorption into the Carnegie Sci­
ence Center. The Buhl Founda­
tion is a multipurpose foundation 
based in Pittsburgh that gives 
out grants to public institutions 
to further public works.
In September, the Buhl Foun-

dation donated a $1 million pro­
jection system to the Carnegie 
Science Center. It is the single 
largest donation to the science 
center in 2006. To reflect its new 
video capabilities, the Henry 
Buhl Jr. Planetarium was re­
named the Buhl Digital Dome.
“This latest grant is really a 
way of putting us on the cutting 
edge,” said Doreen E. Boyce, 
president of the Buhl Founda­
tion. “And the potential of this 
technology is huge. It’s mind 
blowing.”
The donation included Digital- 
Sky, powerful computer-graphics 
software developed by SkyScan, 
Inc., of Nashua, N.H. The state-of- 
the-art system can project up to 5 
million pixels per frame of high- 
definition video, while standard 
digital video is between one-half 
and 1 million pixels per frame. 
High-definition pictures can in­
clude much crisper detail and are 
more pleasing to the eye.
The images are projected onto 
the 50-foot dome screen above 
the seating to give the viewers a 
true three-dimensional experi­
ence. Instead of merely watching 
a movie, the audience seems to 
move through a three-dimen- 
sional space.
For astronomy education, the 
planetarium uses the latest data 
from NASA’s image databases in 
its shows. It can recreate a full, 
digital universe from that data 
and can display up-to-date im­
ages from the Hubble telescope.
To coordinate the highly in­
tricate shows and displays, over 
100 pieces of equipment work 
in sync. Slide projectors, video, 
special effects, and the digital 
star projector must orchestrate 
the planetarium experience, and 
the new dome means even more 
capabilities.
“I could turn the sun off if I 
want to turn the sun off, and 
then I could spin it around,” said 
James Hughes, producer for the 
Buhl Planetarium. “It’s a one 
click, and another click.”
The planetarium also plans to 
exhibit programs for other sci­
entific field applications, such

Water filter is no 
‘short straw'
The Danish textile company 
Vestergaard Frandsen, which 
operates under the ethos of cre­
ative “imagineering,” has devel­
oped a $3 water purifier.
Called “Lifestraw,” this water 
purifier is a seven-inch “straw” 
with meshes, filters, and holes 
that can be worn around the 
neck. Although not a perfect 
filter, the Lifestraw cleans out 
99.99 percent of the bacteria and 
parasites that contribute to di­
gestive and stomach problems.
Lifestraws that can filter out 
small viruses (such as polio) 
and metals (such as arsenic) are 
in development. Around 6000 
people in third-world countries 
die each day from waterborne 
diseases.

Fox uses mobile 
phone broadcasts
When a single-engine plane 
crashed into the side of a Man­
hattan apartment complex on 
Wednesday, Fox News Channel 
cameraman Scott Wilder didn’t 
break the story with his camera
— he used his phone.
It was a hand-hend Palm Treo 
smart phone, to be exact, that 
sent streaming images directly 
to the Fox News control room. 
While the video from the crash 
wasn’t outstanding, it repre­
sented the first time that a net­
work featued video captured 
from a cell phone live on air.
The technology could be use­
ful in tightly-packed cities like 
Manhattan, where transmit­
ting live videos with a camera 
requires a satellite truck. In 
densely populated cities, such 
trucks are often cumbersome 
and late in arriving. Cell phone 
footage is not intended to re­
place the camera, but it might 
provide an alternative for re­
porters on the go.

Scientists teleport 
light successfully
Eugene Polzik and his team 
at the Niels Bohr Institute in Co­
penhagen were able to teleport 
information stored in a beam of 
light into a collection of cesium 
atoms.
By shining two lasers in suc­
cession on a group of atoms with 
identical unidirectional spins, 
the group was able to transfer 
the quantum state of the second 
beam into the cesium cloud.
Teleportation, essentially, is 
the transfer of quantum states 
between separate atoms. And 
there are even realistic applica­
tion possibilities for the devel­
opment of teleportation. The 
results could be used in the de­
velopment of superfast comput­

How Things Work: Hybrid Cars
Kathy Chiapaikeo
In the recent past, people 
have payed a much higher price 
for gasoline than before. Some 
are even reluctant to fill up the 
gas tank because they might 
end up spending $30 or $40.
A gasoline-powered car can 
usually drive at least 300 miles 
between refueling, can be re­
fueled quickly and easily, and 
keep up with traffic on the 
road.
But gasoline-powered cars 
also produce a lot of pollution 
and get subpar gas mileage. On 
the other hand, electric cars 
produce almost no pollution, 
but can only go 50 to 100 miles 
between charges.
Over the past few years, 
though, the automotive indus­
try has found its happy medium: 
A hybrid car is a compromise 
between the two that can in­
crease gas mileage and reduce 
emissions.
A hybrid car consists of a 
gasoline engine, an electric 
motor, a set of batteries, and a 
generator. The gasoline engine 
is much smaller and uses ad­
vanced technologies to reduce 
emissions. The car also uses 
the engine in order to increase 
power and efficiency.
Simultaneously, the electric 
motor can draw energy from 
the batteries to accelerate the 
car and return energy to the 
batteries. This means that the 
gas pedal and the brake pedal 
are equally important, because 
a hybrid car uses “regenerative 
braking” to recover energy and 
store it in the battery.
When the hybrid car brakes, 
energy in the form of heat is 
given off and stored. The elec­
tric motor uses the stored en­
ergy to generate a little electric­
ity to charge the batteries, and 
the cycle continues.
Sometimes, when the vehicle 
is stopped, at a red light for in­
stance, the hybrid can shut off 
the gasoline engine because it 
can rely on its alternate power 
source — the electric motor and
batteries.
Some hybrids, like the Toyota 
Prius, use a unique power split 
device that hooks the gasoline 
engine, generator, and electric 
motor together.
Once the car reaches a cer­
tain speed, the gasoline engine 
will turn on and settle into a 
constant speed, while the gen­
erator and electric motor work 
to match the output speed of 
the car. The gasoline engine 
and electric motor move the 
car, and the generator produces 
all the electricity.
In addition, the forward ar­
eas of many hybrid vehicles 
are designed to reduce aero­
dynamic drag. Some hybrids 
are designed using a teardrop 
shape where the back of the car 
is narrower than the front. The 
rear wheels are partially cov­
ered by body work to provide a 
smoother shape.
Even the tires differ on hybrid 
cars. The tires on most cars are 
optimized to minimize noise,
give smooth rides, and provide 
good traction, but hybrids use 
special tires that are optimized 
for efficiency. They are stiffer 
and inflated to a higher pres­
sure than regular tires in order 
to reduce drag.
Lastly, hybrids are built out 
of lightweight materials, like 
aluminum, that greatly reduce 
the amount of energy needed to 
accelerate the car.
By reducing the weight of 
the car, manufacturers can use 
a lighter engine with the same 
level of performance as regular 
cars.
For example, the engine in 
the Honda Insight weighs 124 
pounds and is a tiny, 1.0-liter, 
three-cylinder that produces 67 
horsepower at 5700 revolutions 
per minute (rpm).
In a hybrid, the electric mo­
tor works alongside the gaso­
line engine to produce the same 
amount of torque as a regular 
gasoline engine car.
The electric motor adds more
rue muiu
torque (the more torque, the 
greater the acceleration) at 
lower speed ranges. Without 
the electric motor, the Insight 
makes its peak torque of 66 
foot-pounds at 4800 rpm. With 
the electric motor, it makes 79 
foot-pounds at 1500 rpm.
Hybrid power is a complex 
combination of gasoline power 
and electric power. A hybrid car 
will squeeze every last mile out 
of a gallon of gasoline to pro­
duce better mileage.
For example, the 2007 Toy­
ota Camry Hybrid has a city 
mileage of 40 miles per gallon 
(mpg), while the 2007 Toyota 
Camry has a city mileage of 
22-24 mpg.
Hybrids are also rated as Ad­
vanced Technology Partial Zero 
Emissions Vehicle (AT-PZEV) 
for emissions. AT-PZEV-rated 
vehicles are 90 percent cleaner 
than the average new car and 
have near-zero evaporative 
emissions, which escape when 
gasoline evaporates.
Buhl Planetarium goes 
completely digital
DOME, from A5
as innovations in biology, chem­
istry, biotechnology, medicine, 
engineering, and architecture. 
“You could fly through molecules 
rather than the solar system or 
the universe,” said Hughes.
With the new dome, the plan­
etarium isn’t limited to its exist­
ing repertoire. “You can bring 
up a JPEG and map it all over 
the dome,” Hughes said. “It’s 
like a giant DVD player. I can sit 
here, and I can hit pause and it 
pauses.”
However, the Buhl Digital 
Dome is not solely a high- 
definition cinema.
With the new software and 
projection system, the center 
also operates as a full-scale pro­
duction facility. The center pro­
duces programming and shows 
for other planetariums world­
wide.
“They are in over 20 countries 
and are now translating into over 
14 different languages. If new 
equipment will be able to facili­
tate that, then they’ll be able to 
make better shows more quickly 
with the Pittsburgh name on it,” 
said Boyce.
The Carnegie Science Cen­
ter plans to air its own original 
production, a space exploration 
to Mars, in spring 2007. The 
program is based on William K. 
Hartmann’s book A Traveler’s 
Guide to Mars.
With enhanced video and 
production capabilities, the new 
Buhl Digital Dome expands the 
science center’s role as an edu­
cational resource for all levels of 
academic study.
Of course, the upgraded plan­
etarium also provides a new and 
exciting experience for casual 
visitors. And it’s more than a 
rehearsed production. With the 
press of a button, the person 
operating the planetarium can 
change a look at the ocean into 
a view of the auroras, or even a 
thunderstorm.
“This is all real time,” said 
Hughes. “It’s not like the man 
behind the curtains.”

Clusty.com provides new search engine alternative
SEARCH, from A5
to make browsing the results 
easier. A search for “Carnegie 
Mellon” on Google could return
13,300,000 results, but it is rare 
to find someone who would look 
through all these results.
“One of the main problems 
of user search is that they get 
too much stuff and only look at 
the first handful of results,” said 
Raul Valdes-Perez, CEO and co­
founder of Vivísimo, Clusty’s par­
ent company.
Based in Squirrel Hill, Vivísimo 
was one of few local Internet firms 
in Pittsburgh. That has changed 
with Google’s decision to open of­
fices at Carnegie Mellon. But how 
different is Clusty from its new 
neighbor?
“Search engine user experience 
has been pretty static for a while,” 
Valdes-Perez said.
By sorting results in themes, 
Clusty saves time and “lets users 
know what is important at the mo­
ment. [Otherwise,] they’re really
missing other themes. They are 
missing a lot of stuff that could be 
of value to them.”
The clusters group results by 
discerning main themes in the 
search results using an artificial 
intelligence-based algorithm. 
However, the algorithms try to 
emulate human considerations 
by constructing a tree of major 
themes.
A search on Google is also 
based on an algorithm, but the 
algorithm ranks search results 
based on the number of websites 
that link to a specific website and 
cross-references that information 
with text matching of the search 
terms to provide the most rel­
evant results.
Google’s current search devel­
opment is personalized search, a 
method that ranks search results 
based on a user’s search history.
Valdes-Perez contends Clusty 
would be just as accurate, but 
better. “The same content and 
same pages you would find on Ya­
hoo! or Google you would find on
Clusty,” he said. “But we wanted 
to show the world there’s a differ­
ent user experience for searching 
the Web.”
Will Clusty provide the next 
mainstream advance in search­
ing and become “the approach 
you will see everywhere”? Val- 
des-Perez thinks it has a good 
chance, even though the search 
engine is only two years old. He 
regards personalized search as “a 
dead end.”
As a meta-search engine, Clusty 
uses its own search engines to 
crawl the Internet but also queries 
search engines such as Ask, MSN, 
Gigablast, and Wisenut to get the 
best results.
“The four engines give the same 
results, but the order is different,” 
said Valdes-Perez. “A meta-search 
engine dampens out the noise.” 
The idea was first developed 
when Valdes-Perez was still a 
graduate student at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Along with Jame Pesenti and 
Christopher Palmer, Valdes-Perez
created the site cluster.cs.cmu. 
edu, an earlier version of Clusty.
In 2000, the team co-founded 
Vivísimo to sell search software 
to governments and large com­
panies for their websites and for 
internal use.
In fact, Vivisimo’s biggest cus­
tomer base is the government, us­
ing the Vivísimo Velocity Search 
Platform to develop sites such as 
militaryhomefront. dod.mil.
Vivísimo software is currently 
used to help power the directories 
that military service members 
and their families use to obtain 
information about programs and 
services.
Although Valdes-Perez says 
Vivisimo’s main focus is business 
search while Google deals often 
with advertising on the Web, he 
admits the two companies do 
compete.
“Google does have a program 
they sell to businesses,” he said. 
However, he was comfortable 
with the idea of Google being in 
Pittsburgh.
“The more operations in tech­
nology there are [in Pittsburgh] 
the more that benefits us.”
As a relatively small company, 
Vivísimo is looking for people 
who like a company in its growing 
stages, especially those who want 
to stay in Pittsburgh.
“It’s interesting working in a 
company like this instead of re­
searching,” said Valdes-Perez. 
“As a researcher you write papers 
and you impact 10, 20, maybe
hundreds of people. But this, 
you reach millions of people. It’s 
thrilling and a lot more satisfying 
than writing a paper for dozens of 
people.”
For those who are looking 
for an alternative to Carnegie 
Mellon’s current website search, 
Valdes-Perez said the company 
“would be thrilled to work with 
Carnegie Mellon University and 
give it the best search engine of 
all universities.”

interested in participating in the 
2007 competitive season. Cut­
ting the year approximately into 
halves, the Spectacular and the 
Science Fair are now able to pro­
mote each other.
Hosting the SciTech Spectacu­
lar in the fall is more conducive 
to outside exploration, explained
After demonstrating the effect, 
the Atypical entertainers encour­
age audience participation, and 
then the official show begins.
“They’ve actually choreo­
graphed it to music,” said Cas­
ciato. The Diet Coke and Mentos 
guys wrap up their show with a 
Q&A session.
It’s no surprise Carnegie Mellon 
has contributed to the exhibits at 
this year’s SciTech Spectacular. 
For example, the Entertainment 
Technology Center’s JAM-O- 
DRUM game is currently set up 
for visitor interaction. Players 
can use their hands to hit the 
JAM-O-DRUM’s round surface 
and trigger vibrant projections of 
light corresponding to the beat.
The Carnivore, a solar-powered 
boat built by undergraduates, is 
another of the Spectacular’s ex­
hibits made possible by Carnegie 
Mellon. Part of an intercollegiate 
competition called Solar Splash, 
the Carnegie Mellon team is 
mostly made up of engineers, 
though a few of its members are 
majoring in design, business, and 
even drama.
Some of the exhibits at the sci­
ence center aim to expose visi­
tors to advancements in famil­
iar technology. This year marks 
the 50th anniversary of the first 
hard drive, which is becoming 
an increasingly important part of 
modern technology.
“Hard drives are basically 
showing up everywhere,” said 
Tim Rausch, a Carnegie Mel­
lon alum representing Seagate. 
In addition to computers, hard 
drives are now standard compo­
nents of video game systems and 
MP3 players alike.
With a variety of activities 
both educational and entertain­
ing, this year’s SciTech Spectacu­
lar will provide a wealth of op­
portunities to the community of 
Pittsburgh.
Five thousand middle and high 
school students are already regis­
tered for this week’s events, and 
Casciato expects another 10,000 
to attend.
The Carnegie Science Center 
is worth a visit, even if it is more 
accessible by bus than it is by 
Senso Car.

We can’t build robots to exercise for us
When he was a lad, Gaston, the vil­
lain from Beauty and the Beast, ate four 
dozen eggs to get large; as an adult he 
upped his consumption to five dozen 
eggs to support his massive muscles.
Eggs might not be the best route to 
healthy bodies, and Gaston may not 
have been the nicest fellow, but he was 
happy, self-confident, and ripped. Why? 
Because he exercised on a regular basis.
According to Men’s Fitness, Carnegie 
Mellon students have a lot of work to do 
to get anywhere near Gaston-style phy­
siques. The magazine recently ranked 
Carnegie Mellon as a school on aca­
demic probation; we “have been called 
out on [our] inadequate fitness.” It seems 
a 17-question questionnaire determined 
our fitness level compared with schools 
throughout the nation.
We concede that we may not be the 
most fit: Physical education is not a re­
quirement, meal blocks can be restrict­
ing, and athletes clog the gyms at peak 
hours.
We refuse, however, to accept that we 
are among the worst in the nation. Fit­
ness classes offered pass/fail on campus 
boast a registration of about 520 people 
per mini. Group exercise classes aver­
age about 740 people per registration 
period. Each year, thousands of indi­
viduals register for intramural sports on 
campus.
The athletic department is making 
strides in advancing the fitness and 
health levels on campus by taking stu­
dents’ interests into consideration when 
creating new classes. The Men’s Fitness 
report never spoke to anyone at the ath­
letic department at Carnegie Mellon. All 
data from the report were based on stu­
dent responses. Maybe if Men’s Fitness 
actually asked school officials what they 
had to offer, its ranking would be less 
suspect. Instead, it relied on the student 
survey-takers to provide information 
such as whether the school offers a nu­
tritionist. (We do.)
This is the kind of survey-conducting 
that enables results like this: In 2005, 
the California State University at Long 
Beach was ranked 20th among fittest 
schools, but this year it’s on the list of 
the least fit. Its freshman class is that 
fat? Doubtful.
It is true that we could all do a little 
more to stay fit. Even if our fitness fa­
cilities were nil, students could still take 
healthy steps. Eat a good breakfast, for
instance. It provides you with energy, 
and helps stave off snacking. Choose 
fruit as a side, and vary your meal 
choices.
As for exercise, here are some hints. 
Don’t waste someone’s time by taking 
the elevator down one floor. The eleva­
tors in the UC are slow enough as it is 
without having to stop at every floor. 
Bored between classes? Take a walk.
Exercise builds endorphins, a natu­
ral chemical released in your brain that 
makes you happy. These same chemi­
cals are released during sex (which, by 
the way, is also a worthwhile exercise 
and calorie burner).
Happiness, in turn, triggers motiva­
tion and confidence, which often en­
able academic and social success — and 
there’s nothing wrong with a little so­
cialization. How else are you going to get 
to the sex-ercise part of your routine?
Even though Men’s Fitness may have 
looked at Carnegie Mellon with ques­
tionable methods, it might help us stay 
off the list next year if we take steps to 
be healthy — the benefits are many. Af­
ter all, a little happiness, motivation, 
and confidence never killed anyone.
Well, except for Gaston.Patriotism takes many forms
If Alaskans can forgo heating oil, then the rest of us have no excuse for not cutting back
No matter how cold the weather here 
turned late last week, Pittsburgh is still 
not the Arctic — even when you consider 
a particularly chilling news item that 
moved in from the north at about the 
same time.
The Associated Press reported last 
Monday that a few villages in Alaska 
are going without free heating oil be­
cause the company providing the fuel 
is controlled by Venezuelan president 
Hugo Chavez, the man who infamously 
called President Bush “the devil” in a 
speech last month at the United Nations. 
Because of the insult, a nonprofit orga­
nization that would have managed the 
donation for four native villages turned 
it down.
“As a citizen of this country, you can 
have your own opinion of our president 
and our country. But I don’t want a for­
eigner coming in here and bashing us,” 
said Justine Gunderson, administrator 
for the tribal council in the Aleut village 
of Nelson Lagoon. “Even though we’re in 
economically dire straits, it was the right 
choice to make.”
At first glance, the situation seems 
absurd. Faced with the price of oil at $5 a
gallon, the unemployment rate high, and 
the mercury at -15°F, it appears there is 
little for these villagers to gain by a state­
ment of loyalty to a generally unpopular 
President except a season of frigid nights 
spent shivering under a pile of blankets.
We, however, see the Alaskans’ deci­
sion differently. We see a group of peo­
ple standing up for their principles, no 
matter how unpopular those principles 
might be. Instead of a futile decree of 
solidarity to the Bush administration, we 
see a meaningful display of patriotism 
that is worth noting, understanding, and 
emulating.
In the current political climate, it is 
only too easy for anti-Bush partisans to 
equate being a “patriot” to being some­
thing akin to a neo-con lap dog. The 
President’s policies have had a remark­
ably polarizing effect on American vot­
ers, reflected on Capitol Hill by incessant 
criticism flying back and forth between 
the pro- and anti-Bush camps. It’s as 
well to remember, though, that sup­
porting your country and being in the 
pocket of its administration are two dif­
ferent things. No one political party, 
way of thought, or group of people has
a monopoly on standing up for what you 
believe in.
Indeed, both Republicans and 
Democrats have talked about the impor­
tance of reducing the U.S.’s dependence 
on foreign oil. Well, here is a chance to 
do so. In Maine and Florida, there are al­
ready calls to break off deals with Citgo, 
Venezuela’s Texas-based oil subsidiary, 
and an editorial in the Anchorage Daily 
News said it was “embarrassing” that a 
state as oil-rich as Alaska should turn 
to a foreign nation for supplies. Here, 
also, is a chance to reap the political and 
environmental benefits of conservation
— in Nelson Lagoon, one of the Alaskan 
villages that turned down Chavez’s offer, 
residents are running their furnaces only 
a few hours each day in order to save fuel 
until other shipments arrive.
If entire towns on the icy shores of the 
Bering Sea can give up free heat, surely 
those of us in comparatively warmer re­
gions can make some sacrifices as well, 
be it turning down the thermostat a few 
degrees or riding a Port Authority bus 
instead of driving a car. There are more 
ways to be patriotic than waving flags 
and shouting slogans.
Academic Affairs needs 
student input to improve
Evan Osheroff
As chair of the Academic Affairs 
Committee of the Undergraduate 
Student Senate, I am fully aware of 
the complaints last year of the lack of 
communication between Senate and the 
Carnegie Mellon community. Academic 
Affairs is made up of a number of hard­
working students. Our primary contact 
within the administration is Dr. Indira 
Nair, vice-provost for education.
I’d like to announce an opportunity for 
students to voice their opinions directly 
to us. I look forward to working with 
everyone to help make academic life for 
undergraduate and graduate students 
better.
On October 24, the academic affairs 
committee will host an open forum, and 
we invite both graduate and undergrad­
uate students to attend. The idea behind 
this forum is to have students come 
and both complain about and applaud 
Carnegie Mellon University. Although 
this committee is academic in nature, 
there is no boundary on the topics I wish 
to discuss — anything from the school’s 
involvement with the community to its 
involvement in your day-to-day lives. 
I want each attendee to think, before1- 
hand, of three things he or she dislikes 
and wants done away with, dislikes 
and wants fixed, or just things already 
enjoyed but needing improvement. Then
for each idea, I want a quick one-liner 
about how we should go about making 
the change. We will then proceed to 
discuss these as a group. I am hoping 
that some of the things brought forward 
can be fixed overnight, and I’m looking 
forward to spending a long period of 
time on others. In an effort to make this 
forum as candid and comfortable as pos­
sible there will be no faculty attending, 
and if they try I won’t let them in. I want 
you all to be able to speak freely without 
fear of consequence.
As many of you should come to this 
as possible; there will be food. In all 
seriousness — if there isn’t a large group 
of people such as yourselves complain­
ing to someone like me about what you 
want fixed or worked on, it won’t get 
done. There is only so much that can 
happen when an administrator meets 
with a diverse group of 10 students rep­
resenting everyone. At this forum every­
one can be represented. So please come, 
bring what’s on your mind, and write it 
down, so I can split those tasks among 
the academic affairs committee and oth­
ers within Senate. Remember, this is the 
Student Senate; we were elected by you 
and we work for you.
The forum will be held October 24, from 
4:30 to 5:30p.m. in the Danforth Lounge, 
UC. Evan Osheroff (eosherof@J is chair 
of the Academic Affairs Committee, and 
welcomes requests for more information.
Actions speak volumes more 
than words or apologies
Aaron Weil
Andrew Carnegie once stated, “As I 
grow older, I pay less attention to what 
men say. I just watch what they do.” As 
I reflect over the recent readme fiasco 
over the “New Hauschwitz” story, I can’t 
help but wonder how Carnegie might 
feel about these events and the various 
players involved.
Sadly, the actual author(s) of this 
failed attempt at satire have chosen to 
maintain both their silence and their 
anonymity. One can only hope that they 
will find the courage to turn their hurt­
ful words into positive action as dem­
onstrated by students in years past. In 
that sense, one would wonder why Chris 
Kier, the editor of readme, neglected to 
publicly apologize for his own acquies­
cence to willfully slandering the good 
name of Tartans for Israel as the sup­
posed authors of the “New Hauschwitz” 
article. His lack of action here sends a 
resounding message that nearly negates 
his carefully worded apology, making it 
seem half-hearted and insincere.
In the weeks since the publication of 
“New Hauschwitz,” there has been an 
outcry from many students for a sign 
of justice beyond mere words. Stated 
differently, while we can’t wish this inci­
dent away, our actions can indeed put 
this whole episode into the proverbial 
dustbin of history... if actions were loud­
er than words.
This concept of “deed over word” is a 
deeply rooted concept in Jewish tradi­
tion. For example, Anne Frank wrote in 
her diary, “Parents can only give good 
advice or put them on the right path. 
The final forming of a person’s character 
lies in their own hands.” It is interest­
ing to note that Anne did not write 
“their own words,” but rather “their 
own hands.” Frank, like Carnegie before 
her, intuitively understood that it is our 
actions, above and beyond our words, 
that we should be judged upon.
A prime example of this idea can be 
encapsulated in the way that Carnegie 
Mellon University’s administration dealt
with this issue. While quickly moving 
to publicly condemn the article for its 
insensitivity, the dean of student affairs, 
Jennifer Church, got involved to meet 
with the students at readme to work 
together with them to mentor a solu­
tion for all sides. In her wisdom, Dean 
Church’s words were both rebuking as 
well as nurturing. This is an impor­
tant point, especially for those mem­
bers of our wider community who are 
less familiar with the world of Student 
Affairs and were quick (not unjustifiably 
so) to seek a punitive solution.
In our field, our goal is first and fore­
most to educate, and in this matter 
there was much to learn from all sides. 
Navigating these waters, for the multi­
tudes who were hurt and offended, was 
no easy feat. But we can feel proud that, 
in the end, it was the students them­
selves who came up with their own solu­
tion to ensuring that an incident like this 
will be less likely to occur again.
Going forward, the editors of readme 
have decided of their own accord to 
bring these kinds of articles not only to 
their own board, but to a wider com­
munity outside of readme for further 
review, in order to ensure that future 
attempts at satire will not be made at 
the expense of others. Is this the perfect 
solution? No, but justice, like every­
thing else in this life, is seldom perfect. 
Rather, there are shades of justice and 
sometimes, if you have thoughtful indi­
viduals on both sides of an issue and a 
willingness to move beyond mere words 
with the courage to take action, you can 
get very close.
While there is no doubt that Frank 
would find little funny and satirical in 
the “New Hauschwitz” piece, I feel quite 
sure that Carnegie would have paid 
attention to what “people have done” on 
this campus. This incident shows that 
education often takes place as a result 
of student action, rather than from an 
educator’s words alone.

Join JFC, make 
things happen 
on campus
[jgiU—
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
On any given day, a myriad of 
activities occur on campus. The 
vast majority of these events are 
funded in part by the student ac­
tivities fee. Your $84 a semester 
goes a long way, and this fee and 
the Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC) that provides the means 
for students to do so much on 
campus.
JFC allocates the student ac­
tivities fee. Composed of under­
graduate and graduate represen­
tatives approved by Senate and 
the Graduate Student Assembly, 
JFC controls the fiscal policy of 
student organizations. This is 
a rare system among universi­
ties because all allocations are 
student driven — there are no 
administrators on the JFC. In or­
der to have an effective JFC, we 
need passionate, capable, and 
competent members. Does that 
describe you?
Within the next month, Senate 
will be approving its JFC slate for 
the fall semester. The time com­
mitment is about four hours per 
week. While being a member of 
JFC is not an overwhelming job, 
it does require a great deal of 
dedication. The budget process is 
not something that can or should 
be glossed over. If you think 
you’ve got great analytical skills 
and a passion for campus life, we 
want you on JFC.
Commitment to JFC is ex­
tremely worthwhile, because 
students can receive tangible 
benefits for being involved — 
you’ll be a part of the decision­
making process that funds and 
sustains nearly every activity on 
campus. It’s a position where you 
can make a difference.
Andfea and I believe in being 
both accessible and responsive 
to the student body. Similarly, 
we believe that we should be 
open with the student body as 
well; open means sharing what’s 
happening on campus as well as 
what opportunities are available 
to students. The best JFC possi­
ble happens when Senate has the 
greatest number of nominees to 
choose from. We want you to ap­
ply to insure that it happens. We 
believe that JFC is a process that 
should include the entire campus 
community, not just friends of 
student government.
So we challenge you, whether 
you’re already significantly com­
mitted or if you’re just looking 
to try something new, to step up 
and try JFC — it’s one of the few 
opportunities on campus where 
you’re guaranteed to have a large 
impact on campus life.
Anyone interested in being a 
JFC rep should contact Joel M. 
Bergstein (jbergste@), the chair 
of the Senate Finance Committee. 
E-mail him your name, class, col­
lege/major, why you want to be 
on JFC, and the list of organiza­
tions you’re involved in. We look 
forward to your application.

Survivor: Cook Islands goes racial
Sarah Mogin
Survivor: In 2000 it was 
America’s gateway drug into the 
world of reality television. Six 
years later, it’s hard to remember 
life without it. Voting a teammate 
off the island, ingesting insects 
and other-other-other forms of 
white meat, and winning “immu­
nity” are all examples of Survivor’s 
impact on popular culture.
TiVos across the country are 
clogged with reality game shows 
riding in the wake of Survivor’s 
success, and such copy-catting 
has taken its toll on the original. 
The show’s creators are forever 
on the lookout for ways to keep it 
fresh, but at what cost?
Survivor’s latest season, Cook 
Islands, is more inappropri­
ate than it is enticing. It began 
with 20 contestants separated by 
race into four teams. The initial 
tribes are thus: Manihiki (African- 
American), Aitutaki (Hispanic), 
Rarotonga (Caucasian), and 
Puka Puka (Asian-American). 
Actually, Hispanic isn’t a race, it’s 
an ethnicity, but that’s only one 
of the many ways that Survivor: 
Cook Islands got it wrong.
Normally, when a show’s cre­
ators are extra-conscious of race 
during the casting process, it’s be­
cause they want to create conflict. 
Just look at FX’s Black. White, or 
MTVs The Real World: Characters 
are picked to push each other’s 
buttons. In the case of Survivor, 
however, tension was not the goal 
— maybe they figured living on 
an island was hard enough. Mark 
Burnett, the show’s producer, 
has told the press, “We’re smart 
enough to have gotten rid of every 
racist person in casting.”
It’s admirable that Burnett 
.wasn’t out to capture scenes of 
staged racial conflict, but it still 
doesn’t explain the motivation be­
hind Survivor’s new format. Sure, 
he wanted to mix things: up, but 
his past efforts to do the same 
have been much more PC.
In Survivor: Marquesas, Burnett 
introduced the Purple Rock tie­
breaker as a remedy for elimi­
nation stalemates. Three seasons 
later on Pearl Islands, voted-off 
islanders were able to participate 
in challenges as members of a 
special Outcast Tribe. And the 
next season, Survivor: All-Stars, 
was entirely devoted to veterans 
of the show, ending in an engage­
ment between Rob and Amber. 
Compared to these, segregating 
tribes by race seems like kind of a 
bold move. Why couldn’t Burnett 
just give us another Purple Rock 
tiebreaker?
In a word: diversity. Critics have 
long chastised Survivor for the 
makeup of its cast, which has been 
predominantly white ever since 
the show’s debut in May 2000. 
Maybe the show’s creators were 
hoping to kill two birds with one 
stone by reviving the format and 
normalizing the demographic at 
the same time. But even if only 
25 percent of its contestants are 
Caucasian, Cook Islands remains 
a pathetic attempt to manufacture 
racial harmony.
One of the reasons Survivor has 
been so whitewashed over the 
years is that approximately 80 
percent of the show’s applicants 
are white. Burnett actually had 
some trouble finding the other 
75 percent of his most recent 
cast. According to Entertainment 
Weekly, contestant Nathan 
Gonzalez of the Manihiki (black) 
tribe was recruited at a sporting 
event. And casting didn’t stop 
there: Those in charge combed 
myspace.com, realtor.com, even 
the turned-down applicants of The 
Amazing Race.
unique perspective to offer the 
rest of the island.
The Golden State aside, Cook 
Islands is still a farce. Host Jeff 
Probst has been quoted in mul­
tiple sources as saying that he 
and Burnett were hoping to tap 
into a theme of “ethnic pride” 
that they detected among their 
applicants. Bad idea.
Case in point: the Puka 
Puka tribe, whose members 
are Vietnamese-, Korean-, and 
Filipino-American. Last time I 
checked, the recipe for “ethnic 
pride” doesn’t call for five peo­
ple with ties to three different 
countries. What would they be 
proud of? How they’ve all been 
mistaken for Chinese? Survivor’s 
new format is only lumping to­
gether five different cultures un­
der the generic label of “Asian- 
American.”
I suppose it’s possible that 
I’m just missing the point about 
what Burnett and Probst are try­
ing to accomplish. If they really 
thought it through, the change 
in format might make sense over 
time. It’s a legitimate theory, 
except for one thing: In Cook 
Islands' third episode, the four 
tribes merged into two teams of 
mixed racial composition. Short­
lived and controversial? Sounds 
like a publicity stunt. Really, the 
worst part about Survivor’s for­
matting faux pas is that it didn’t 
even mean anything.
Call me superstitious, but I 
can’t ignore the fact that Cook 
Islands, the first season of 
Survivor to really cross the line,
Television seasons are like dog years — 
anything above seven is probably pushing it.
Sound a little forced? It shows. 
We might as well rename the 
this season Survivor: California, 
because that’s where a whop­
ping 13 of its 20 participants 
currently reside, as reported on 
realitytvworld.com. Of those, nine 
(that’s 45 percent of the total cast) 
live in or around Los Angeles. Now 
that’s what I call diversity. I’m sure 
each of the L.A. contestants has a
is the show’s 13th. Maybe 13 is 
unlucky, but it’s also a pretty big 
number. Television seasons are 
like dog years — anything above 
seven is probably pushing it. My 
diagnosis? I think it’s time we 
put Survivor to sleep.

Google and YouTube set to revolutionize online media
Evan Sundwick
In a relatively short timespan, the online 
video repository YouTube has become a 
haven for Internet denizens looking for a 
quick entertainment fix.
Miss the great interview on last night’s 
The Colbert Report? Looking for a sneak 
preview of the next big blockbuster? 
Searching out news on the newest com­
puter games? Desperate to see the next 
chapter of R. Kelly’s patently ridiculous 
rap-melodrama “Trapped in the Closet”? 
Curious about the plight of Lonelygirll5, 
a starlet who carved out a devoted viewer- 
ship of millions before it was revealed that 
her story, a teen drama about religious 
parents and secret love interest, was all 
conceived as a pitch for a movie?
YouTube offers a virtually unrivaled 
breadth of video content, but more impor­
tantly, that breadth drew 29 percent of all 
online video traffic — amounting to more 
than 100 million videos viewed every day 
— according to statistics released in mid- 
July. The number has surely increased 
since then, but its future is starting to come 
into question.
As many of you have probably heard 
by now, October 9 saw the purchase of
YouTube by everyone’s favorite wonder 
corporation, Google. Rumors had been 
flying for days regarding the purchase, 
but no one expected the price: $1.65 bil­
lion. Google’s video service had been an 
also-ran when compared to YouHibe, with 
a smaller selection of content but the capa­
bility to sell video online.
Google’s influence on YouTube will like­
ly be minimal; they are keeping the compa­
ny’s headquarters where it has been since 
its founding, and YouTube employees (all 
60 of them) are keeping their jobs. What 
Google’s shopping spree has resulted in, 
though, is a very strong financial backing 
for years to come. ,
That cash will prove to be a useful asset 
when arguably one of the biggest sources 
of YouTube’s popularity continues to come 
underfire. The white elephant in the room 
is the question of copyright. YouTube is 
known as the place to go to track down any 
video clip you want to see; unfortunately, 
plenty of people want to see material that 
they don’t own the rights to. And of course 
Big Content won’t have any of that.
Or will they? On the eve of thé deal 
with Google, YouTube inked contracts with 
three major content providers — Universal, 
CBS, and everyone’s favorite whipping boy: 
Sony BMG. These companies have agreed 
to provide content to YouTube’s users free 
of charge. The primary focus of many of
these deals, including the one made with 
Warner Music several weeks back, is music 
videos. Four-minute clips that are essen­
tially advertising for a new CD are a perfect 
fit for online consumption, and the labels 
are realizing this.
The whole world of online video has 
been growing quite rapidly. Along with 
YouTube and Google Video’s rise to promi­
nence, the digital media juggernaut known 
as iHines has branched out heavily into 
video content. A year ago Apple announced 
television shows were available online for 
purchase, and just last month the company 
added full-length movies to their reper­
toire. The service has been a huge success, 
even though they are charging between 
$2 and $15 for downloads. The market is 
there for video content without screwing 
over the producers — and the producers of 
that content are finally getting the idea.
The deals with major content produc­
ers have virtually ensured that YouTube 
is in the clear for the time being. What 
has real potential to change the way the 
online video business works, though, is 
new software YouTube is developing to 
help copyright owners find copyrighted 
videos being shared on the website. The 
software will scan a video, determine who 
owns the rights to it, and hopefully then 
begin giving the copyright owner revenue 
whenever the video is viewed.'
It’s a rare situation where everyone 
wins: Copyright owners, the ones who 
are so desperately clamoring to nick- 
el-and-dime users over every piece of 
content they control, get a guaranteed 
revenue stream for their precious intel­
lectual property. Users get to watch free 
videos with little to no interference. And 
YouTube keeps its users happy, and in 
time gains more users, making their own 
revenue stream grow.
YouTube is in a prime position to rede­
fine how copyright holders think about 
their content. No longer is the content 
industry a dictatorship. YouTube has the 
capability to force content providers to 
play on our terms. Now that the con­
tracts have been signed, the chips are 
in play — and YouTube’s killer cards are 
just starting to hit the table. For a compa­
ny whose motto is “Broadcast Yourself,” 
its user base is its greatest weapon. If 
the users stray because the content pro­
ducers are cracking down too hard, the 
content producers will have no way to 
make their money; everybody loses, and 
YouTube will become one more footnote 
in the industry’s history lesson of how 
not to play.

Tartan tennis players compete at ITA Championship
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
Four Carnegie Mellon tennis 
players traveled to Fort Myers, 
Fla., last week to compete in the 
Intercollegiate Tennis Associa­
tion (ITA) National Small College 
Championship. The champion­
ship took place at Florida Gulf 
Coast University and was pre­
sented by the United States 
Tennis Association (USTA).
Senior Mona Iyer and junior 
Amy Staloch finished third in 
the women’s doubles champion­
ship. Staloch also placed third in 
the singles championship. First- 
years Nikola Ljuboja and James 
Muliawan finished seventh in the 
men’s doubles championship.
Iyer and Staloch advanced 
to the semifinals on Thursday 
by defeating Jackie Shtemberg 
and Christina Contrafatto of the 
College of New Jersey 5-7, 7-6 
(7-3), (12-10). Iyer and Staloch 
trailed 8-5 in the super tie­
breaker, but came back to take 
seven of the last nine points to 
win the match.
“We changed a lot through­
out [the quarterfinals],” Staloch 
said. “We went into it playing so- 
so and just got better and better. 
There were several match points 
for both teams before we finally 
won, so it was pretty exciting.”
The next day, Iyer and Staloch 
were defeated by Laura Fanjoy 
and Gabriela Carvalho of the 
University of the South in the 
semifinal match 7-6, 6-3. In the 
consolation match, the Tartans 
defeated Amanda Romana and 
Elizca Buys of Carthage College 
to secure a third-place finish.
With their win in the quarter­
finals, Iyer and Staloch became 
All-Americans for the 2006- 
2007 season. This is the third 
straight year that the pair has re­
ceived All-American honors.
In the singles championship, 
Staloch defeated Molly Fiala of 
Coe College 6-1, 6-2 on Thurs­
day to advance to the semifinals. 
“I just kept the ball in play lon­
ger than [Fiala],” Staloch said. 
“She had a hard time with high, 
deep balls, so I just kept hitting 
those.”
Staloch faced Elizabeth Bondi
of DePauw University in the 
semifinals, falling to Bondi 6-2,
6-1. Bondi went on the win the 
singles title; her second title in 
three years. Bondi was not at 
the tournament when Staloch 
won the singles championship in 
2005.
Staloch faced Richelle Mara- 
sigan from Emory University in 
the consolation match, defeating 
her 6-3, 6-3 to take third place.
“The reason I won that match 
[against Marasigan] was because 
I stayed so level-headed,” Staloch 
said. “I have really improved my 
mental toughness throughout the 
past couple years in college and 
that’s what got me that win. I just 
played my game against her and 
never got frustrated that she’s a 
very consistent player.”
Ljuboja and Muliawan were 
defeated by Eric White and Dan­
iel Quinones of the University of 
Mary Hardin-Baylor 6-1, 6-4 in 
the men’s doubles quarterfinal 
match on Thursday.
“We had high expectations,” 
Ljuboja said. “We wanted to get 
at least third, but [White and 
Quinones] were very solid and
much older then us. They were 
very experienced,and placed the 
ball very well. They weren’t very 
powerful, but they were very ag­
gressive.”
On Friday the Tartan duo de­
feated Thanos Kantarelis and 
Eric Hansen of the University of 
Rochester 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-2) 
to secure seventh place in the 
championship.
Ljuboja and Muliawan were 
two of only three first-year 
players to qualify for the cham­
pionship. Ljuboja attributes their 
success to the duo’s teamwork. 
“We have good chemistry,” he 
said. “I hit hard and put them 
away, and James has really 
good placement. One guy set the 
other guy up — we’re a one-two 
punch.”
The ITA Championships 
marked the end of the fall season 
for men’s and women’s tennis 
teams.
The teams’ spring season 
opens on the road when the men 
take on Mercyhurst College and 
the women take on Slippery 
Rock University. Both matches 
will take place on February 3.

Tartan volleyball wins two
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
volleyball team traveled to Chi­
cago last weekend for its second 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) round robin. The two-day 
tournament was hosted by the 
University of Chicago. Carnegie 
Mellon played four games, win­
ning two and moving its season 
record moved to 14-11 and 4-3 
in UAA competition.
The Tartans faced New York 
University (NYU) and Case 
Western Reserve University on 
Saturday, falling to the NYU Vio­
lets 3-1 but taking Case 3-0. On 
Sunday, the Tartans again split 
their decisions, losing to Wash­
ington (Mo.) University 3-0 and 
beating Chicago by the same 
score.
Saturday morning the Tartans 
faced 15th-ranked NYU, fall­
ing to the Violets 30-24, 25-30, 
30-27, and 30-26.
Middle hitter Malena Yablin- 
sky led the Tartans offense with 
nine kills. Setter Catie Fisher and 
outside hitters Amanda Bradford 
and Becky Metier followed with 
eight kills apiece.
“We had a few chances to 
put games away, but we just 
choked and couldn’t finish,” 
middle hitter Abbie Toney said. 
“It’s frustrating to be so close but 
shoot yourself in the foot and 
miss serves or not pass easy balls 
up.”
On defense, libero Kat Fox led 
the team with 26-digs, followed 
by Bradford, who had 24. Setter 
Brea Carlock had 18 assists, and 
setter Samantha Carter recorded 
17 assists and four service aces. 
Yablinsky and Bradford had 
seven and four block assists, re^ 
spectively.
“Our defense was on this 
weekend,” Toney said. “The NYU 
coach said we were annoying 
just because our defense wasn’t 
letting anything down. We made 
people earn their points.”
Carnegie Mellon next played 
Case, sweeping the Spartans in 
three matches 30-26, 30-22, 
30-27.
Bradford led the Tartan of­
fense with 11 kills. Fisher re­
corded eight kills, and Yablinsky 
and outside hitter Megan Killeen 
both had seven kills.
Fox again led Carnegie 
Mellon’s defense with 15 digs. 
Bradford followed closely with
14. Bradford also contributed 
three block assists and three ser­
vice aces to the Tartans’ defense. 
Carlock and Carter had 19 and 
14 assists, respectively.
On Sunday at 9 a.m. the Tar­
tans faced Wash. U., the num- 
ber-two team in the- nation. 
The Bears tore Carnegie Mellon 
apart, winning the match 3-0 
(30-24, 30-15, and 30-26).
Bradford again led the Tartan 
offense with 10 kills. Fisher and 
Toney had nine and seven kills, 
respectively. Carlock added 18 
assists and Carter added 10 to 
the team’s offense. “Against 
Wash. U. we had a no-fear, noth- 
ing-to-lose attitude,” Toney said.
Bradford led defensively as 
well, recording 12 digs during 
the game. Fox followed with 10. 
Metier recorded two solo blocks, 
and Yablinsky had two block as­
sists.
The Tartans finished the round 
robin on a high note, defeating 
Chicago 3-0 (30-20, 30-21, and 
30-24) early Sunday afternoon.
Fisher collected 11 kills, fol­
lowed by Bradford and Killeen, 
who each had eight kills. Carlock 
picked up 20 assists and Carter 
had 12.
Defensively, Bradford had 15 
digs and three solo blocks. Fox 
had nine digs, and Carlock had 
eight digs and four service aces. 
Yablinsky added three block 
assists and four service aces. 
Middle hitter Jessica Brackin 
contributed three solo blocks 
and three block assists. Metier 
rounded out the Tartan defense 
with two solo blocks and one 
block assist.
“Chicago wasn’t much for 
competition, but it was nice to 
have a victory to head home on,” 
Toney said.
The Tartans are back on the 
road this weekend when they 
travel to Huntingdon, Pa., for the 
Juniata Tournament. Carnegie 
Mellon will face Juniata College, 
Franklin & Marshall College, 
and Rutgers-Newark in the two- 
day tournament.

and her speed often times al­

The teams went into the half

with only 34 seconds remaining

Stever netted the game-

She took a through ball from 
sophomore forward Abby Cof­

fense’s signature for years, when 
the Tartans retook possession, 
they looked to a different source 
for yardage but achieved the 
same result.
On second-and-three from 
their own 24, senior quarterback 
Kevin Mulkern dropped back 
and found senior wide receiver 
Mark Davis down the middle of 
the field. The explosive scoring 
strike, Davis’ first score of the 
season, marked Carnegie Mel- 
lon’s fourth touchdown in three 
games that covered at least 50 
yards.
The 13-3 advantage held up 
through halftime thanks in part 
to — another Tartan trademark 
this season — a turnover. Af­
ter allowing a first-quarter field 
goal, the defense forced punts on 
Case’s next three drives, limiting 
the Spartans to just 18 yards on 
nine plays.
And when Case took posses­
sion near midfield late in the sec­
ond quarter, senior linebacker 
James Rogers sacked Spartan 
quarterback Angelo Mirando, 
stripped the ball, and recovered 
the fumble, ending any chance of 
Case cutting the 10-point deficit.
The Spartans opened up the
second half by threatening Carn­
egie Mellon’s lead, but Rogers 
and the defense again took the 
air out of the Spartans’ efficient, 
pass-heavy offense. After Case 
drove to the Tartan 36-yard line, 
junior linebacker Trent Sisson 
stripped running back James 
Rosenbury, and Rogers fell on 
the fumble for his second recov­
ery on the day.
“A lot of [Saturday’s] game was 
change of possession,” Rogers 
said, who recorded eight tackles 
and one sack. “There were a lot 
of key times in the game where 
things could have gone one way, 
but our defense stepped up and 
took the momentum away from 
them.”
The ability to force turnovers 
and convert mistakes into points 
was critical to the undefeated 
first half of the season.
Heading into week six, the 
Tartans had forced nine turn­
overs and scored off seven of the 
ensuing drives (six touchdowns, 
one field goal).
Following Rogers’ recovery, 
the Tartans ran the ball seven 
consecutive times to march 64 
yards for their third score. Sivek, 
who totaled 104 yards on 29 car­
ries, capped the drive with his 
second one-yard touchdown on
the day. Junior running back 
Robert Gimson — also a weekly 
threat to break the century mark
— carried the ball 16 times for 93 
yards.
“When we needed to get it 
done, the offensive line put forth 
the effort,” senior running back 
Jon Cakert said. “I think espe­
cially Travis and Robert really 
found the holes and did what 
had to be done, and that’s pretty 
much what wins you games.”
With a 20-3 lead halfway 
through the third quarter, the 
defense continued to bend but 
not break against a Spartan of­
fense that averages 22 points and 
219 yards passing per game.
After Sivek’s second touch­
down, Case drove to the Tartan 
five-yard line but gambled on 
fourth-and-goal, choosing to 
forgo the field goal attempt and 
go for a touchdown. Senior nose 
tackle Mike Reggie sacked Mi­
rando at the nine-yard line to 
force a turnover on downs.
Two series later, after a blocked 
punt gave Case another chance 
deep in Carnegie Mellon terri­
tory, the defense again clamped 
down. Senior linebacker Terry 
Bodnar intercepted quarterback 
Dan Whalen and returned the 
pick 60 yards to the Case 32.

Senior Mark Davis (#33) outruns the Spartan defense in Saturday’s game.
The two offenses traded inter­
ceptions on the next two series, 
and Case scored a quick touch­
down on two plays late in the 
fourth quarter to cut the lead to 
20-10. But the combination of 
four turnovers and the Tartans’ 
11:36 time of possession in the 
fourth quarter alone sealed a 
sixth straight win heading into 
the crucial three-game confer­
ence portion of the schedule.
“I think the biggest thing was 
to reestablish ourselves into the 
second half of the season,” Cak­
ert said. “We felt that everything 
we had accomplished was great,
but we really had to get it done. 
The ball was in our court and we 
had to establish ourselves in the 
UAA. We hadn’t proven anything 
yet. [Saturday] I think we did a 
great job of that.”
The next conference test will 
be noon on Saturday when the 
Tartans host the University of 
Chicago, a program that defeated 
the Tartans 35-6 last season.
“We have a pretty big score 
to settle with Chicago,” Rogers 
said. “The most important thing

best foot forward and really take 
it to them.”

Tartans defeat Case Spartans to win annual Academic Bowl
The Carnegie Mellon football team celebrates around the Academic Bowl trophy. The Tartans beat Case Western Reserve University 20-10 to win the bowl and Carnegie Mellon’s Homecoming.
by Adam Lazarus
Staffwriter
The annual Academic Bowl 
between Carnegie Mellon and 
Case Western Reserve University 
is supposed to be a reminder that
two scholarly universities are 
also capable of excellence on the 
football field.
But the Tartans have been 
proving their football erudition 
ever since the season opened 
in early September. And with 
Saturday’s 20-10 victory at Case
Field, the Tartans grabbed their 
first University Athletic Associa­
tion (UAA) victory of the season, 
moving to 6-0, and began to 
make their claim as the confer­
ence’s elite team.
“It’s a big win on the road for 
us at their Homecoming,” Tartan
head coach Rich Lackner said. 
“So I thought our kids performed 
very admirably.”
The Tartans — who defeated 
Case 23-20 last year on a field 
goal as time ran out — opened up 
the game with a familiar lengthy 
drive that ate up time and put
points on the scoreboard. A nine- 
play drive that took 9:13 to cover 
89 yards ended when junior run­
ning back Travis Sivek reached 
the end zone from one yard out 
for his sixth rushing touchdown 
of the season.
Case immediately responded
and narrowed the gap to 7-3 with 
a long drive that netted three 
points via Brian Calderone’s 27- 
yard field goal.
While short, consistently pro­
ductive runs have been the of-

Men’s cross country team wins its home invitational
by Sam Kim
Junior Staffwriter
Last Saturday, the men’s and 
women’s cross country teams 
returned home to race at the 
Carnegie Mellon Invitational in 
Schenley Park. The men beat 19 
teams to win the invitational; 
the women placed ninth out of 
20 teams.
Building on their first-place 
finish at the Dickinson Invita­
tional the previous week, the 
men edged out Mount Union Col­
lege to secure the overall team 
victory with 43 points.
Mount Union finished ahead 
of the Tartans at the Spiked Shoe 
Invitational at Penn State ear­
lier in the season, but fell short 
on Saturday, finishing in second 
place with 55 points. The Carn­
egie Mellon alumni team took 
third with 124 points.
The women’s team finished 
ninth with 236 points. George 
Washington University took the 
overall first place with 83 points. 
Saint Francis University and the 
University of Pittsburgh finished 
in second and third place with 
113 and 125 points respectively. 
The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
alumni team raced to a fifth- 
place finish with 156 points.
Men’s cross country
Despite the windy conditions, 
sophomore Brian Harvey came
in first place overall in the 8K 
race with a time of 25:41.51. Af­
ter winning the 4K last weekend 
at the Dickinson Invitational, 
Harvey has placed first in back- 
to-back races.
“It’s pretty exciting to win,” 
Harvey said. “It was the perfect 
temperature for running, but it 
was tough coming up thè hill.”
Senior captain Geoff Misek 
was close behind Harvey, finish­
ing third overall with a time of 
26:11.09. Sophomore Breck Fre- 
sen and first-year Dario Donatelli 
finished ninth and 10th over­
all with times of 26:23.88 and 
26:24.32, respectively.
Junior Jason Jura finished 
20th overall with a personal best 
time of 26:41.55.
“I ran 30 to 40 seconds bet­
ter than the previous race,” Jura 
said. “The [wind] wasn’t so bad 
in the woods. Last half mile, it 
was really windy, but a Mount 
Union runner was blocking the 
wind so that helped.”
Junior Mark Tressler and 
sophomore Ryan Anderson fin­
ished 25th and 26th with times 
of 26:51.10 and 26:41.46, respec­
tively, to round out the top seven. 
“I finally ran the best race in a 
long time,” Tressler said.
The men’s team will look to 
carry its momentum into Satur­
day’s race at the University Ath­
letic Association (UAA) Champi­
onships. The race will be hosted 
by Washington University in St. 
Louis.

First-year Hallie Espel contin­
ued her impressive rookie season 
by finishing 27th overall and 
first for the Tartans with a time 
of 19:42.94 in the 5K race. “I am 
very happy with the race,” Espel 
said. “Honestly, I didn’t expect to 
lead the team. We do workouts 
together and we’re really work­
ing on running as a team.”
Behind Espel, first-year Dani­
elle Sedlack and sophomore Car­
olyn Clayton finished second and
third for the team with times of 
19:55.83 and 20:00.66, respec­
tively.
Senior Jerri Castillo and junior 
Carrie Kmetzo followed with 
times of 20:26.88 and 20:39.06, 
respectively. First-year Anna 
Lenhart and sophomore Chrissy 
Krutz rounded out the top seven 
with times of 20:54.05 and 
21:04.89, respectively.
The women’s team will join the 
men’s team at the UAA Champi­
onships at Wash. U. in St. Louis 
on Saturday.
Men’s soccer loses its 
first UAA game 1-0
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team lost its first Univer­
sity Athletic Association (UAA) 
game of the season on Sunday 
afternoon against New York Uni­
versity (NYU) by a score of 1-0.
Earlier in the road trip, the 
Tartans defeated Brandeis Uni­
versity 2-0 in another UAA con­
test.
Carnegie Mellon, ranked 16th 
in the D3kicks.com top-25 poll, 
had their hands full with the' 
15th-ranked Violets on Sunday. 
The Violets held a huge advan­
tage in the shot department, 
taking 19 shots compared to 
only four from Carnegie Mel­
lon. The game was tied at zero at 
halftime, but in the 64th minute 
NYU midfielder Jeritt Thayer 
scored the game’s only goal on a 
penalty kick that went past Tar­
tan sophomore goalkeeper Mat­
thew Bazin.
The loss at NYU puts the Tar­
tans at 10-3 overall and 3-1 
in the UAA. This loss snaps the 
team’s five-game winning streak 
and marks only the second time 
they have been shut out all sea­
son.
Prior to traveling to New York, 
the Tartans visited Waltham,
Mass., to battle the Brandeis 
Judges on Friday night. The 
Tartans, thanks to the Browne 
brothers, prevailed 2-0 over 
Brandeis. Senior forward Jona­
than Browne and first-yearjnid- 
fielder Ryan Browne each scored 
a goal in the win.
Only 87 seconds into the 
game, Ryan Browne one-timed a 
pass from brother Jonathan into 
the goal for his fourth goal of the 
season.
In the 52nd minute, Jona­
than Browne added a goal of 
his own with senior midfield­
ers Sean Filipovitz and Will 
Schlough having assists on the 
play. Filipovitz’s corner kick 
went to Schlough, who headed it 
to Browne. Browne then headed 
the ball past the Brandeis goal­
keeper into the net for his fifth 
goal of the season.
Bazin made four saves in 
the win against Brandeis and 
stopped nine shots against NYU.
“Our goals all season have 
been to perform well in all of 
our conference games, all of 
our non-conference games, and 
hopefully win conference, and 
show well in the tournament
— nothing short of that,” senior 
forward Andrew Park said.

Tartan women’s soccer 
beats NYU Violets 2-1
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon wom­
en’s soccer team traveled to 
Waltham, Mass., and New York 
City this past weekend to play 
Brandeis and New York Univer­
sity (NYU) in University Athletic 
Association (UAA) action. The 
Tartans fell 2-1 at the hands of 
Brandeis on Friday night, but 
regrouped to edge NYU 2-1 Sun­
day afternoon.
Against Brandeis on Friday, 
the Tartans fell behind 1-0 in the 
31st minute when Brandeis mid­
fielder Melissa Gorenkoff fired a 
shot from 20 yards out that de­
flected off the far post and past 
Tartan sophomore goalkeeper 
Christie Adams.
Early in the second half, Carn­
egie Mellon junior Kasey Stever 
tied the game at one apiece. In 
the 51st minute, Stever collected 
the rebound of sophomore for­
ward Abby Coffin’s missed shot 
and kicked it into the back of the 
net.
Unfortunately for Carnegie 
Mellon, the game did not stay 
tied for very long. Judges senior
forward Lisa Kaplin, their lead­
ing scorer on the season, blasted 
a shot into the upper left corner 
of the goal in the 63rd minute to 
give Brandeis a 2-1 lead.
Despite the Tartans out-shoot- 
ing the Judges 14 to 12, Carnegie 
Mellon was not able to bring 
home the victory.
The team fared better on 
Sunday, as it defeated the NYU 
Violets 2-1 to collect its first 
UAA win of the season. The win 
puts the Tartans at 5-6-1 on the 
season and 1-3 in the UAA.
Stever scored both of Carn­
egie Mellon’s goals, giving her 
seven for the season, five of the 
last six goals Carnegie Mellon 
has scored.
Only three minutes and 20 
seconds into the game, junior 
midfielder Jess Howard crossed 
a pass into the NYU penalty box 
that Stever was able to head into 
the net to give the Tartans the 
early 1-0 lead.
“We came out strong and ready 
to play [Sunday],” Howard said. 
“Early in the game, I had the ball 
on the right side of the field and 
was able to cross the ball toward

Junior Staffwriter
After winning last year’s con­
ference championship, Carnegie 
Mellon’s men’s cross country 
team is looking to repeat its 
success this season. Leading
the Tartans is sophomore Brian 
Harvey. On Saturday, Harvey 
won the men’s 8Kat the Carnegie 
Mellon Invitational. The week­
end before, Harvey won the 4K 
at the Dickinson Invitational. 
Recently, Harvey sat down with 
The Tartan to talk about his sea­
son.
Tartan: When did you start 
doing cross country?
Harvey: Well, I was very 
athletic as a kid. I played three 
sports, and then in high school 
I did not make the soccer team. 
So I started doing cross country, 
really as something to do and a 
way to make friends, but then I 
really got into it; not necessarily 
even because I was good at it, 
but I just really enjoyed getting 
out there and just running.
T: Did you plan on doing 
cross country when you came to 
Carnegie Mellon?
H: Actually, I had no intention 
of running in college, and my 
high school coach heard, and 
was really surprised and kind 
of talked me into it. So I ended 
up looking at college teams and 
meeting coaches, and that is a 
big part of why I ended up at
Carnegie Mellon, and I am really 
glad I did.
T: How do you deal with be­
ing a student athlete at Carnegie 
Mellon?
H: It is definitely a challenge, 
but it is great. Practice gives me 
time to just get away from every­
thing and relax for a little while, 
and our coach is really amazing. 
He really works on making sure 
that we are doing well in every 
part of our lives and focusing 
on both cross country and our 
academics.
T: Do you have any pre-race 
rituals?
H: Well, everyone thinks it 
is pretty weird, but I have to 
shower before a race. It sounds 
really dumb because I am get­
ting up early to go run and get 
dirty and sweaty again, but I 
have to shower before I race. 
A lot of people do some weird 
things, like wear the same dirty 
pair of socks during every race 
all season, but I just have to have 
my shower.
T: How do you focus during 
such a long race and what keeps 
you going?
H: I am naturally a very com­
petitive person, which can be a 
bad thing because it overflows 
into basically everything I do, 
but during a race it helps a lot. 
I really just focus on the race 
itself, not a particular strategy or 
anything, but just running as fast 
as I can and ignoring the pain.
T: Is there anything in par­
ticular you would attribute your 
success to?
H: I have really done well from 
season to season, focusing on 
what my body is telling me to 
do. I have never had a running- 
related injury, so I have just been 
able to build every year.
T: Okay, we know you spend 
most of your time running 
through Schenley Park, but what 
is your favorite thing to do in 
Pittsburgh?
H: I really like going to shows 
and stuff like that. I went and 
saw the Blue Man Group when 
they were here and that was re­
ally cool. I like going to all the 
sporting events too; there are 
plenty of them. I would really 
love to go to a Steelers’ game, 
but I do not know if that will get 
to happen.

THEARNcFF: Ann Coulter?
Recent book doesn’t prove a
I honestly tried to like Brainless: The Lies and Lunacy 
of Ann Coulter by Joe Maguire. I am not saying that 
because I am in some way addicted to or affiliated with 
Ann Coulter, I promise; I am not a fan of anyone with 
the massive record of demeaning quotes Coulter has 
to her name. Unfortunately, Maguire’s book forgets to 
rehash her most maddening remarks and instead he 
merely mumbles about how much he really hates her.
Few of the just over 200 pages of this book are 
actually spent dealing with the inaccuracies, possible 
plagiarism, and misconstrued facts that Coulter has 
produced in her more than 10 years as a political figure. 
Coulter has, in many ways, redefined the political 
punditry landscape. She has described herself as 
someone who likes to “stir up the pot,” and in doing so 
she has made myriad controversial statements across 
her five best-selling books.
Maguire even thanks Coulter in the acknowledgements 
for being “such an easy target,” and honestly, she is. 
From her comments on women ("[T]he problem with 
women voting — and your Communitists will back 
me up on this — is that, you know, women have no 
capacity to understand how money is earned,") to her 
views on Senator Joe McCarthy's policies ("[He had] 
a gift for appealing to the great common sense of the 
American people” and “Liberals like to scream and 
howl about McCarthyism.... They’ve had intellectual 
terror on the campus for years.... It’s time for a new 
McCarthyism,") she has certainly expressed her 
extreme opinions. Worst of all might be her comments 
towards the family members of 9/11 victims: “These 
broads are millionaires, lionized on TV and in articles 
about them, reveling in their status as celebrities 
and stalked by grief-arazzis. I’ve never seen people 
enjoying their husbands' death so much."
While Maguire does get around to blasting apart one 
of Coulter's “lies," the book focuses on her "lunacy” 
and, specifically, on sarcastically and back-handedly 
insulting her at any opportunity he gets. The sarcasm 
becomes so thick it is hard to handle at times, and 
even the language dries up — any book that uses the 
phrase “Pete's sake” twice in the first 18 pages is one I 
want to put down.
At times it seems that Maguire has simply run out 
of material. In the middle of his chapter “Ann on 
Women," he goes off on a tangent discussing the three 
things you say when you want to make a woman hate 
you: "You’re a bad mother. You're a slut. You act like 
a man." At which point he discusses how Coulter 
“probably would be a bad mother,” going further to say 
"she'd probably be the absolute worst — absentee, 
simultaneously neglectful and domineering, and with 
nothing but white wine in the fridge.”
This is cracked! Maguire forms this book around the 
thesis that Coulter distorts the truth or simply avoids 
it by distracting people with outlandish and attention- 
getting statements, and yet he does the same thing; 
this book is, ultimately, really a tribute to the method 
Coulter has developed. The writing style reminds me
point against political pundit
of something a bitter ex-boyfriend might write about 
his bereaved ex-lover. I believe it is possible that 
Maguire is secretly in love with Coulter... and then 
she broke up with him, so he wrote a book about her. 
This makes perfect sense: He can call her an awful, 
horrible person, but at the same time compliment her 
for being a brilliant writer. I only wish he would have 
picked up some of those writing skills.
Now, Mr. Maguire, please explain to me the chart 
which takes up half of page 129 called "Nicknames 
for Ann Found on the Internet." There are only seven 
names on this chart, and I could do better than that 
in five minutes. Though maybe this was the right 
direction to head in. Overall the best way to improve 
this book would be to have simply created a list of 
Coulter’s outright lies, misleading statements, and 
hypocritical quotes, with citations that show they are 
false. Yes, I believe this whole book could have been 
reduced to a chart. A really giant chart.
Maguire was an editor at Reuters until they saw 
this book. According to a piece in The New York 
Times, a Reuters company statement states: “Our 
editorial policy and The Reuters Trust Principles 
are prominently displayed for all to see on www. 
about.reuters.com. Mr. Maguire’s book will soon be 
available. Both speak for themselves.”
Brainless suffers from a few major problems. The 
pacing is off. The second chapter of the book, "Ann 
on Beauty, Race, and Culture" is 42 pages, more than 
double most of the other chapters, which really slows 
down his argument. This, coupled with the fact that 
there is no real conclusion to the book, completes the 
impression that this whole exercise is simply a tirade 
that fades off into nothingness. Also as mentioned 
earlier, the language is not compelling, and it is often 
too informal. Finally, the humor isn’t there. Maguire is 
not a comedian; he is (was?) a journalist, and he often 
fails when trying to go for laughs.
In conclusion: Don’t read this book. It is easy enough 
to make fun of Ann Coulter without a guided tutorial.

Friday Night Lights a ‘Smash’ hit
NBC’s newest TV show features School of Drama grad
Gaius Charles was determined to find a full-time acting job 
within a year of his 2005 graduation from Carnegie Mellon's 
School of Drama. Although he had previously had some spots 
in various commercials and a performance in NBC's Book 
of Daniel, Charles was unsatisfied. According to the press 
release issued by the School of Drama, he wrote on a piece 
of paper that he would have a job by February 2006, along 
with "In God I Trust." He hung this on his wall so he could be 
inspired by it daily — and during the first week of February, 
he landed a regular role on the new NBC series Friday Night 
Lights.
Charles can be seen as Brian “Smash” Williams on Friday 
Night Lights, which debuted October 3 on NBC and has 
already received rave reviews. The show, which airs Tuesday 
nights at 8, is based on the 2004 film and the book by H.G. 
Bissinger of the same title. On the surface, it seems to simply 
feature a small Texas town’s state championship football 
team in yet another underdog story. What sets the program 
apart from other cliched sports programs is its focus on the 
interpersonal relationships in the team and backstories of the 
town. Although it has not received the number of viewers 
projected by the network, The New York Times has critically 
acclaimed it "a fiercely controlled and inventive work of art."
Friday Night Lights focuses on the fictional town of Dillon, 
Texas, and its high school football team, the Dillon Panthers. 
Football is the highlight of this town’s life. When their star 
quarterback gets paralyzed during the first game of the 
season, the team and town must learn how to cope with the
immense pressure to bring back the championship with their 
second-string quarterback. Charles’ character on Friday Night 
Lights is a tough-talking running back — think Terrell Owens 
back in his high school days. In a recent episode, for example, 
“Smash" clashes with teammate Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch), 
both on the field and off, and then seduces Riggins' girlfriend. 
So much for “there’s no I in team."
However, Charles' character's personality is a testament to 
his acting skills, according to Charles’ former professors in 
the School of Drama. He is described as “kind and humble" 
by professor Anthony McKay, who taught Charles in his first 
year at Carnegie Mellon. Charles credited Carnegie Mellon's 
School of Drama, claiming that it “gives us the technique to 
do anything as an actor.” McKay made a note about Charles' 
career at the School of Drama, saying he was “impressed with 
his growth and range" over the four years. Charles' sophomore 
acting professor, Barbara MacKenzie-Wood, agreed with 
McKay and added, “He had a quiet tenacity and was not 
at all showy.... [He] was a very green actor coming into the 
program, but was such a hard worker, was so determined, 
and he continued to grow. Some students rest on their laurels; 
Gaius doesn't.”
Movement professor Catherine Moore, who had Charles 
as a student his first and third years, remembers Charles 
specifically in a one-man show that he wrote and starred in 
during the School of Drama's Playground week. During this 
week, students develop their own theater performances. 
Moore remembers that Charles’ show, about a soldier in
Iraq, was so popular, that he was so "flexible and talented in 
creating” distinct and strong characters, that it sold out, and 
demand dictated the addition of another performance. Along 
with his Playground production, Gaius participated in the 
world-renowned National Institute of Dramatic Art program 
in Sydney, Australia, his senior year, where the seeds for his 
one-man show were planted. He is also remembered for his 
performance in the musical Wild Party. Charles was dedicated 
to getting everything he could out of his Carnegie Mellon 
training and showing the many aspects of his talent.
Charles' legacy in the drama department is one of a hard 
worker, dedicated to his artistic success and development, 
and a role model to his peers. He came in taking nothing for 
granted with a "cooperation to learn,” according to McKay. 
That attitude has rewarded him professionally. As Moore said, 
"[It is] nice to see success happen to kind people."

ouFn writer soon to be found on campus
Alumnus who wrote for — and now produces — hit ABC TV show to speak in Baker Hall
The word "Hollywood” may conjure images of glamour, 
parties, wine and cheese; one shot and you hit it big or lose 
it all. Behind the scenes, it's a different situation. Javier 
Grillo-Marxuach, supervising producer of Lost and graduate 
of Carnegie Mellon University, is coming to tell potential 
Hollywooders the ins and outs of his career as part of the 
Alumni Reading Series on Saturday at 8 p.m. in the Adamson 
Wing of Baker Hall.
"Javi,” as he likes to be called, began his life in Puerto 
Rico and moved to Ann Arbor, Mich., at the age of 10. He 
graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 1991 with a B.A. in 
creative writing and literary and cultural studies and went to 
the University of Southern California for his master's degree.
Grillo-Marxuach's big break came when he was studying at 
USC and working at Kinko’s. NBC came around to recruit 
a junior executive, and Javi chose to take them up on their 
offer because, he claimed, “I wanted to buy a laserdisc player 
and Kinko's wasn't paying too well.” Though this job did not 
envelop Grillo-Marxuach in his true passion, writing, he used 
this opportunity to launch his career. No one should worry 
about getting an agent in order to make it, according to 
Grillo-Marxuach. Instead, ''[You should worry about] whether 
you have chops as a writer."
One of a writer's biggest assets is his or her own confidence 
in his or her own writing. “I’ve always been a writer," Grillo- 
Marxuach explained. As a playwright in high school, he said, 
"I knew from the start that I wanted to write for movies, films, 
and the stage.” He knew that he would work hard to achieve 
a name, so he always had faith in his work. “People will 
respond to great material and great material will open doors 
to you,” he said.
For Grillo-Marxuach, Carnegie Mellon opened these doors.
He said that Carnegie Mellon was "the best of many worlds.” 
Grillo-Marxuach, having been blessed with an urge to write
The cast of Lost, which has been 
written by Carnegie Mellon alum 
Javier Grillo-Marxuach.
and create stories, focused on extracurriculars pertaining 
to his major. In his days here, he worked with Scotch 'n'
Soda Theatre and The Tartan. “I really just wanted to write,” 
he said. Grillo-Marxuach estimates that he had written 
approximately 26 plays through his high school and college 
years. “[Carnegie Mellon is a] very intellectually charged 
environment... encouraging for exploration,” he said.
Sharon Dilworth, a professor in the creative writing 
department, worked extensively with Grillo-Marxuach during 
his time here; she worked with him on his honors project.
"It doesn’t surprise me that he’s writing for a show [such as 
Lost].... Otherworldiness is fitting of Javi’s work.” According 
to her, Grillo-Marxuach had an attraction to superheroes as 
his main characters. Dilworth also commented on Grillo- 
Marxuach’s writing style. When given something to edit, 
Dilworth said, "Javi doesn’t rewrite. He just writes again.... I 
think he had the right idea.”
Grillo-Marxuach's approach to writing is unique. "What’s 
interesting is that there is no one method.... What’s important 
is the spark that interests you and [that] you can create 
something from it," he said. To Grillo-Marxuach, the idea is 
most important to the writer. He explained that a common 
fallacy for writers is that they should sit and wait for a story, 
but the process is not the most important part.
Screenwriters also understand the importance of conveying 
the story. "Screenplays are really just the blueprints of the 
story,” Dilworth said. "TV is a collaborative medium," Grillo- 
Marxuach commented, "not a combative environment. They 
[the directors] want it to be good. You want it to be good. You 
work together to make it great." He said that the true task of a 
writer is "to communicate what’s on screen efficiently."
Most people may find it difficult to understand how Grillo- 
Marxuach puts up with criticism. He said, “You have to have 
a real hide. Some people aren’t going to like your material."
However, Grillo-Marxuach takes this feedback constructively. 
On directors filming their take on the script, he said, 
"Sometimes it's better.”
Despite the fame, Grillo-Marxuach feels pride in no single 
production. Rather, he said, "[It is enough to] continually 
improve as a writer... to turn promise and talent into 
something sustained.” He enjoys his solid career, which has 
allowed him to “continuously hone craft and continuously 
improve." Lost is one such achievement. “What I am 
proudest of is that I have a body of work and not a little 
[success here and there],” he said.
Still, Grillo-Marxuach knows that ‘‘Lost is a once in a lifetime 
experience." He began the job as a writer for Lost early 
on. ABC originally had plans for a show called Nowhere, 
which went nowhere in regards to turning the concept from 
a vague idea to an actual show. J.J. Abrams and Damon 
Lindelof originally came up with the idea of castaways on 
an island, and they hired four writers, Grillo-Marxuach being 
one of them, to become a “little think tank," according to 
Grillo-Marxuach. Out of this came the Golden Globe Award- 
winning TV series Lost.
Grillo-Marxuach's mind is currently tuned into his return 
to Carnegie Mellon. "It's wonderful over there," he said.
He treasures this school as the true launching pad for his 
career. Grillo-Marxuach, it turns out, is not just a supervising 
producer of a hit TV show; he is a former Fairfax Apartments 
resident, lover of the 'O,' and former columnist of The Tartan, 
among many other things. He comes back with one main 
message in mind for the aspiring writers here at Carnegie 
Mellon: "Don’t ever stop writing. Everything follows from your 
craft.”

A Day Without a Mexican addresses immigration issues
Filmmakers Sergio Arau and Yareli Arizmendi speak on campus about their documentary
In 2004, a billboard on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles 
proclaimed, "On May 14th there will be no Mexicans in 
California.” Within two and a half hours, a Latino woman’s 
complaints resulted in the billboard being tom down and 
replaced with an advertisement for cheese. Filmmakers Sergio 
Arau and Yareli Arizmendi then made a second attempt to 
promote their film, A Day Without a Mexican, with billboards 
placed in Latino areas of L.A. reading "El 14 de mayo los 
gringos van a llorar," or “On May 14th, the Americans are 
going to cry.” This time, “Let me tell you what happened," 
Arau said: "nothing."
A Day Without a Mexican is rife with controversy because it 
takes a clear stance on immigration issues facing the United 
States. In the mockumentary, all of the Latinos in California 
disappear, launching California into a severe economic and 
social crisis. Without the crucial Latino workforce, crops 
are left unharvested, restaurants are left unstaffed, and 
households are left unmanaged. Every aspect of Californians’ 
day-to-day lives is touched by the absence of Latinos, be it 
on a personal or economic level. It illustrates the economic 
dependence of the world's sixth biggest economy on Latinos, 
both documented and undocumented.
Arau and Arizmendi are both native Mexicans and active 
artists committed to social change. Arau has a master's 
degree in film. He is famed for his rock group Botellita de Jerez 
as well as his political cartoons, paintings, and MTV award- 
winning film direction. Arizmendi is a writer and an actress, 
having appeared in films as well as on popular TV shows such 
as 24 and Six Feet Under. She studied political science as an 
Courtesy of aznews.us undergraduate and has a master’s of fine arts.
Arau and Arizmendi came to Carnegie Mellon's Porter Hall 
100 last Monday as keynote speakers for Hispanic Heritage 
Month. The married duo detailed the process they went 
through in creating their innovative movie. "We were walking 
in New York in '94 and ... they closed all the museums and 
galleries to show all the artists who died of AIDS and called 
it a day without art,” Arau said. The couple immediately 
thought, "What California needs is a day without Mexicans." 
Arizmendi asked, “How do we make this invisible presence 
visible? If we took it away, if it weren’t there, it would 
probably be felt strongly. Our absence would be weighing 
more than our presence in that way."
Though the idea was bom in 1994, it took a strong push for 
Arau and Arizmendi to begin the actual filmmaking process. 
“One day in '97 we were talking about this idea. A friend of 
ours stood up and he said, ‘I give you three months to start 
this film or I’m going to steal the idea,”’ Arizmendi said. 
Chicago’s Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum gave the couple 
funding for their project and agreed to screen its premiere.
The couple began furiously working on a movie short. “This is 
what we like to call emergency filmmaking," Arizmendi said. 
“Guerrilla filmmaking.'’
Through exposure in international and domestic film festivals, 
the short gained acknowledgement. Companies began to 
approach Arau and Arizmendi about turning the short into a
feature film. Arau and Arizmendi eventually found producers 
who allowed them to pursue their own visions and political 
concepts. The team co-wrote the script for the movie, starring 
Arizmendi and directed by Arau.
Despite A Day Without a Mexican's repeated mocking of 
Americans' tendency to refer to all Latinos as Mexicans,
Arau and Arizmendi decided to use the word "Mexican" in 
the title of the film instead of "Latino." "There was nothing 
so powerful as A Day Without a Mexican, because it has 
the word Mexican in the title. I grew up Mexican and it was 
a nationality, but here everybody whispers it," Arizmendi 
explained. “The title had to work for the objective, and that 
it did because that got people definitely turning to what this 
[film] was about.”
The movie received somewhat unfavorable reviews from 
critics. "The big battle cry from reviewers was 'What is it?
Is it a documentary? Is it a comedy?'” said Arizmendi. The 
filmmakers themselves dubbed the movie a "fused genre.” 
Although the story is fictional, the film was shot documentary- 
style, with handheld camera footage and interviews with 
characters. The film’s parody and exaggeration is definitely 
comedic. Arau described it as both a "mockumentary” and a 
“political cartoon."
That a film tackling so somber a subject as immigration 
law is in large part a comedy frequently surprises viewers. 
Arizmendi described the use of humor as “a little Trojan 
horse" allowing the message of the movie to get through to 
people without them quite realizing it. “The use of humor 
affords you a vehicle to talk about very serious issues in a 
deeper way and to have your audience relax a little bit to 
listen,” she said.
A Day Without a Mexican definitely inspires a dialogue about 
immigration issues. “It’s really interesting how much impact 
the movie had; how there was such a buzz around it when 
it came out in 2004 and that there was a resurgence of the 
buzz in May of 2006 during the countrywide Day Without 
Immigrants," pointed out sophomore Georgianne Papacostas. 
The film is even used as part of the curriculum in a course 
at Carnegie Mellon, the freshman seminar From Peasants to 
Ph.D.s, taught by Susan Ambrose, the associate provost for 
education and a professor in the history department.
Luis Rico-Gutierrez, associate dean of the College of Fine 
Arts and a native Mexican, remarked on Arau's talent as 
a subversive musician. “What he was really good at was 
taking the most basic form of culture, which is the culture 
most Mexicans lead, and giving it a position in the realm 
of art." This is precisely what Arau and Arizmendi have 
accomplished in their film. They created a piece of art that 
is accessible and articulate and that continues to inspire 
dialogue and debate on immigration issues in America.

This flick from Hong Kong director 
Johnnie To is an exercise in the . 
cops-and-robbers genre featuring 
some clever commentary on our

thieves hole themselves away in an 
apartment building, and both they 
and the police manipulate the media 
to their advantage. If you’re not sick

A few decent and honest jokes 
about relationships are sprinkled 
about, but the film is otherwise a 
disappointment.

McKellen and Bill Nighy do some 
voicework. See it for free before 
regular people can.
No go: Nick Park, who co­
wrote all of W&G, isn’t listed as a

Childhood nightmares come to life 
in this above-average CGI family 
movie. Some neighborhood kids, 
sick of being terrorized, take on 
an anthropomorphic, child-hungry 
mansion. Reaches near-Pixar 
quality of jokes for the kiddies with 
enough winking nods for the adults. 
It’s PG, though, so it’s not designed 
for the youngest of kids. The MPAA 
is stupid, though, so maybe just 
ignore what I said.
Go: A family movie you need not be 
ashamed of. I’ll recommend it just 
on that basis.
No go: Jon Heder (Napoleon 
Dynamite) plays a character, and 
I’ve had quite enough of him, thank 
you.

Call it Bring It On 4: Now With

Missy Peregrym plays a gymnast 
who must learn lessons about hard 
work and esprit de corps, just like 
every sports movie ever made. Jeff 
Bridges (The Big Lebowski) phones 
in his role as the gymnastics coach. 
This is probably the best movie ever 
if you’re an anorexic 12-year-old 
gymnast, which you’re not.

more fun. Just stay in.

It wouldn’t be Halloween without a 
cult classic. I use the term “classic” 
here with tongue firmly in cheek, 
since this movie lacks even a 
modicum of plot, talent, budget, 
or fun. Still, this one ranks up there 
pretty high on the “awesomely bad” 
scale like Gigli or, well, Gigli, and it 
was popular enough to merit three 
(!) sequels and a cartoon series. So 
you may want to give it a try.
Go: If you’ve ever wanted to try 
watching a movie Mystery Science 
Theater 3000 style, complete with 
snarky commentary and robots, 
you’re at the right school, and this 
might be your movie.
No Go: Mutated tomatoes. Cult 
classic. Need I elaborate further?

Three bands, two concerts, one week
Do Make Say Think, Broken Social Scene, and Islands play Pittsburgh
DO MAKE SAY THINK
While waiting for the headliner of the evening to perform, 
concertgoers often encounter a particularly perplexing foe: the 
opening band. Making their way on stage by whatever artifice 
they can, these bastards seem to exist solely to increase the 
amount of time that fans must wait to see their favorite band.
. One can either venture into the crowd to secure a good spot 
fdr the top act — risking a close-up experience with a lesser- 
known, boring, and poorly received band — or play it safe and 
stay in the back to chat it up with fellow malcontents.
This Wednesday, when Broken Social Scene comes to Mr. 
Small's, listening to the opening band will not be its usual 
loathsome experience. Wednesday’s concert will begin with a 
different sort of band — the phenomenal Do Make Say Think.
Do Make Say Think is an instrumental post-rock/experimental 
jazz band hailing from Toronto. Its sound is somewhat similar 
to those of Sigur Ros and Mogwai. Utilizing guitars, keyboards 
and oscillators, two drumsets (both in the studio and on tour), 
horns and winds, and the occasional string section, the group 
has produced four fantastic albums since its formation in 
1995.
Do Make Say Think's songs have been described as music 
to decompress to, a label undoubtedly referring to the 
band's masterful use of tension and release to evoke a grand 
spectrum of emotions. Many songs center around a guitar 
melody repeating long enough to mesmerize the listener as 
the bass and drums creep in with perfectly complementing 
rhythms. Slowly, the instruments increase in volume and 
ferocity as a droning horn section is added to the woodwork.
After building unthinkable amounts of tension, the members 
of Do Make Say Think uniformly switch gears into a differently 
paced section, pleasantly surprising the listener with new 
melodies, often alluding to the beginning of the opus. In 
recordings, these grand progressions are complemented by 
their heavy production — reverb-laced guitars, reversed drum 
hits, filtered horns, etc. One can only imagine the power that 
the band will have on stage.
With overlapping band members, Do Make Say Think and . 
Broken Social Scene are perfect tourmates. Do Make Say 
Think will surely set an excited mood before Broken Social 
Scene takes the stage to rock the evening to a close. So if you 
plan on checking out the concert, make sure you get there in 
time to see Do Make Say Think; maybe it will revive your faith 
in opening bands.
Suggested Listening: "Minmin" — Goodbye Enemy Airship 
The Landlord is Dead and "Ontario Plates" — Winter Hymn 
Country Hymn Secret Hymn
BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE
Now, let’s not let Do Make Say Think steal all the thunder. 
Broken Social Scene itself is sure to pick up where its opening 
act leaves off. The 15-member indie “super group,” notorious
for its energetic sets, will be headlining Wednesday night’s 
show, enlivening Pittsburgh listeners with its fresh, creative 
sound.
Broken Social Scene was formed in Toronto in 1999 and 
released its first album, Feel Good Lost. Yet it was not until its 
pop-infused sophomore release, You Forgot it in People, that 
the band was able to reach a more mainstream audience. For 
this second album, vocalists Leslie Fiest and Emily Haines 
joined to complement the mostly instrumental band. You 
Forgot it in People won a Juno Award (Canada's equivalent to 
a Grammy) in 2003 for “Alternative Album of the Year,” and 
Broken Social Scene won the award again in 2006 for its self­
titled album.
Broken Social Scene, the band's newest release, revisits the 
catchy melodic riffs and pop vocals that made You Forgot it, 
in People so immensely popular. On the disc the group also 
toys with a new, more experimental sound, which may seem 
a bit disjointed to listeners more accustomed to Broken Social 
Scene's previous albums.
Take the song “Marketfresh," which includes technical 
effects resembling the irritating high-pitched sound of 
microphone static. The use of such a technique is definitely 
a risk, but many argue that this out-of-the-box musicianship 
is what makes Broken Social Scene so appealing; the band is 
continually able to incorporate the most random elements into 
its creations, providing a sound that is always fresh.
Of course, the self-titled album also offers tracks capturing the 
sound of generic indie. The song "7/4 (Shoreline)” has a pop 
flavor reminiscent of the band’s earlier work, in addition to a 
newer, melodramatic edge, achieved through the combination 
of vocals by Leslie Fiest and lively guitar solos.
Broken Social Scene reaches beyond the mundane confines 
of any one genre to create an eclectic combination of 
instruments and vocals. Whether new or old, the sound of 
Broken Social Scene is sure to satisfy your indie appetite, or 
any musical appetite for that matter.
Suggesting Listening: “7/4 (Shoreline)” — Broken Social 
Scene
ISLANDS
Have you ever heard of those groups with quirky and 
complex musical compositions, catchy vocal melodies, and 
bizarre song names like “Where There’s A Will There's A 
Whalebone”? Of course you haven't, unless you've heard of 
the Montreal-based indie-rock group Islands.
Although Wednesday night’s concert at Mr. Small's will be 
the talk of the town, it will only be Pittsburgh's second stellar 
concert of the week. Islands is performing tonight at the 
Lawrenceville Moose Lodge. The band, which formed after 
the breakup of cult-famous group The Unicorns, is touring 
extensively to promote its sole album, Return to Sea. Islands' 
influences are many: The band features a poppy bounce close
to The Beatles circa Rubber Soul, compositional complexity 
the likes of Sufjan Stevens, and a sound of electro arena-rock 
similar to that of The Killers.
Though the album lacks cohesion, the songwriting chops 
on Return to the Sea are fabulous. On "Volcanoes,” shuffling 
snare drum patterns and half-note acoustic bass lines 
bring back the days of Johnny Cash country-rock. Singer- 
keyboardist-guitarist Nick Diamonds sings, "Just hold on as 
long you as you can / I'm so afraid to die," as the song creeps 
into an Arctic Monkeys Brit-rock refrain. "Rough Gem” calls 
for a pair of tight hipster jeans. It's a bare-bones keyboard- 
driven song with simple but catchy synth lines, a warm vibe, 
and surprisingly depressing vocals: “Dig deep, but don’t dig 
too deep / You’ll see the hole is empty.”
The mood then shifts: Return to the Sea calls upon its listeners 
to trade in their pretentious vintage T-shirts for beach attire 
and Hawaiian leis. "Jogging Gorgeous Summer” is a beautiful, 
melodic number with a peppy island groove (cheesy pun 
intended), provided by the band’s smoking rhythm section of 
Aaron Holmes on drums and Patrice Agbokou on bass. After 
the jazzy "If' and the ambient experimentation of “Ones,” 
Islands closes out the record with “Renaud,” a song of user- 
friendly simplicity, stripped down to piano and vocals.
Although Islands is still developing its sound and style, the 
band's gifted songwriting abilities outshine any problems 
on Return to the Sea, making it a promising first record. The 
album is an impressive start to Islands’ career, predicting a 
successful promotional tour; next stop: Pittsburgh.
Suggested Listening: “Jogging Gorgeous Summer”
— Return to the Sea
Do Make Say Think and Broken Social Scene will play this 
Wedneday at Mr. Small's in Millvale. The show begins at 8 
p.m.; tickets are $25.
Islands will play tonight at the Lawrenceville Moose Lodge 
in Lawrenceville. Call 412.361.2262 for time and price 
information.

The Carnegie Science Center's 
new exhibit, Risk!, features a 
beam that simulates hanging 
steel beams on construction sites.
Justin Brown I Assistant Photo Editor
Take a Risk! at the Carnegie Science Center
New exhibit teaches elements of decision making
Taking turns lying on a bed of 4788 steel nails is how many 
visitors now spend the day at the Carnegie Science Center. 
Torturing participants was not the objective; the new Risk! 
exhibit is an interactive risk-takers’ playground asking: Are 
you tough enough?
The science center’s new exhibit, developed by the Fort 
Worth Museum of Science and History, is an exploration of 
the science, math, and critical thinking skills behind risk- 
taking in everyday life. Understanding the logic behind risky 
situations allows for better decision making by estimating 
probable outcomes. The exhibit also allows spectators to view 
the ways in which technology is changing the amount of risk 
behind certain occupations and daily activities.
A path of warning signs with facts such as the probability 
of death by car accident dots the walkway through this 
large exhibit, which takes up more than half of the second 
floor at the science center. Risk! is laid out in a circle that 
begins with the probability of risks people make, and works 
its way through a risky occupation section and a preventive 
technology section beforeJinishing with an explanation of 
how math and science can be used to assess risks.
A display titled "The Order of Things” is popular with many 
adult visitors. Colorful panels explain how most things reside 
around the middle of a spectrum with few things happening 
at the extremes. The stock market is such a thing: Most 
people will remain around the middle, but in rare situations 
some will win a great deal of money and others will lose a 
great deal of money.
The risk-assessment studies department at Texas A&M 
University contributed to Risk! with a map-covered panel
and book full of images of the most dangerous places people 
inhabit all over the world. Students from the university will 
spend the year designing and developing preventive-measure 
technology that may one day be useful to people dwelling in 
risky environments.
Perhaps discouraging for some spectators, the "One in a 
Million” display provides a realistic opportunity to see what 
the clichéd phrase looks like. A clear plastic tube is filled with 
1 million tiny beads in different colors, yet there is only one 
bead in the entire tube that is black. Participants are asked to 
spin the tube and shift the beads around to look for that one 
black bead.
“How Old am I?" is another popular attraction. Participants 
station themselves at a computer, where they must record 
their current age and then answer a series of about 20 
questions about their daily life. Most questions have to 
do with health and wellness concepts such as smoking, 
exercising, and stress levels at work. While answering these 
questions, two ages appear at the top of the screen, the 
participant's current age and the participant’s health age.
The healthier your lifestyle, the more your health age drops 
from your current age, while answering “no" to questions like 
"Do you eat fruits and vegetables?" or “Do you wear your seat 
belt?" can drive up your health age significantly. This display 
is a great way for visitors to see how lifestyle choices can put 
them at risk for a premature death.
A glass-enclosed display shows the progression and 
advancement of protective devices, such as helmets, which 
prevent injury and death and make real-world situations 
less risky. The world’s riskiest occupations are discussed 
throughout the display, and participants can try on protective
fire gear, experiencing the protection of new technology and 
comparing it to older models that were riskier to wear. Also 
displayed are mining artifacts that show a progression of the 
technology used to test the air, beginning with a tiny wooden 
canary cage and ending with digital air testers.
Another exhibit mimics the daily life of a steel worker at a 
construction site. A narrow steel beam stretches across the 
floor, and beneath it is a picture of what a street would look 
like from 17 stories up. People and cars are just tiny moving 
specks from such a height. Clouds and chirping birds move 
around, mimicking life 17 stories above ground. While visitors 
take turns walking along the steel beam, the noise of the 
birds and the sight of the street below and the clouds swirling 
around create realistic distractions that real construction 
workers face every day.
Though many small children enjoy the exhibit, the displays 
and activities are better for teenagers and adults who take 
them more seriously; young children don't necessarily 
understand risk-taking and lack experience with decision 
making.
Risk! will run at the Carnegie Science Center until May 2007.

Zombie walk celebrates Pittsburgh’s horro
Carnegie Mellon graduate George Romero’s series of scary movies triggers attempt to break world recon
Zombies face great obstacles when trying to breach 
a city like Pittsburgh. With its three rivers, Pittsburgh 
becomes almost zombie-proof — for everyone knows 
that zombies cannot swim... or so goes the lore of 
George Romero’s 2005 film Land of the Dead. But as fans 
of the movies know, we may not be as safe as we think.
The Monroeville Mall, which was the set of Romero’s 
film Dawn of the Dead, will again be home to a host of 
undead on October 29.
Mark Menold, who hosts the local horror program The 
"It's Alive" Show on WBGN, will lead what he hopes to 
be a record-breaking number of zombies into the mall 
— if all goes well, the place will be swarming with them. 
He is attempting to gather enough zombies together 
to break a Guinness World Record for most decaying 
corpses gathered in one place; so if you were planning 
on a new pair of Pumas to go with your Halloween 
costume, you may want to bring along your AK-47.
On second thought, leave the arsenal at home. The 
zombies in the mall this time around will be relatively 
harmless — just a group of horror fans dressed to kill.
Or rather, dressed to eat brains. This will be the second 
zombie walk to take place in Pittsburgh lately; the last 
was in the South Side on September 22.
There is no word yet on how many zombies will have to 
appear in order for Menold's minions to enter The Guinness 
Book of World Records. “This idea is so new that our message 
board committee is still trying to find out if this is a new 
category or if there is an existing number we have to meet,” 
said Menold. “I’m sure if there’s an existing number it will be 
beaten."
There may not be.a world record for most people posing 
in zombie garb, but walks like the one hosted by Menold 
have taken place in cities from Toronto to Atlanta. All that is 
required for a zombie walk is a few people dressed and made 
up to look like living corpses. Usually they stumble around a 
city or another urban area.
Looking at the success of the South Side walk in September, it 
shouldn’t be too surprising if Monroeville Mall is successfully 
inundated with the undead. “It could be 250, it could be 1000,
I don’t know," Menold said. “This is going to be all ages," he 
said. In the South Side walk, no one under 21 could attend the 
event held at the Rex Theatre after the walk.
“There’s no such thing as a lame zombie walk," Menold said. 
“As long as it’s more than one guy it's okay. Because that's 
really what they are: It's just a few nuts who will show up 
somewhere unannounced and freak people out.”

of the Dead.

>r history J by Michelle Bova | Contributing Editor
d in Pittsburgh
“crusty” look — lots of people will go out to watch a horror 
film. Romero's four zombie films, for instance, have a wide 
following that spans generations; Night of the Living Dead 
was released in 1968, and Romero’s most recent film Land 
of the Dead came out just last year. Aside from Land of the 
Dead, all of the films in Romero's zombie tetralogy have been 
filmed in or around Pittsburgh; and though Pittsburgh isn’t 
the name of the city in Land of the Dead, the city in the film 
bears strong (and intentional) resemblance to it.
Romero has also used Carnegie Mellon as a setting for his 
films: His movie Creepshow was partially filmed in the 
basement of Margaret Morrison. If you’ve felt chills run up 
and down your spine on the way to studio, now you can tell 
your friends it's not just paranoia.
Romero attended college here, and though his education was 
delayed, he finally graduated in 1983. Suddenly it makes more 
sense that Ted Danson has a role in Creepshow.
Because of the Romero connection, several faculty members 
at Carnegie Mellon had the opportunity to take part in the 
films, too. College of Fine Arts Dean Barbara Anderson and 
her husband Cletus Anderson, a professor emeritus of drama, 
both worked on several Romero films; he served as production 
designer and she as costume designer. Both were involved 
in Night of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead. Judy Conte, 
another drama professor in the college, said that it was Cletus 
and Barbara Anderson who urged her to take a small but 
memorable role in Romero's film Day of the Dead.
She chose to be a zombie ballerina "because [dancing] 
happens to be my expertise,” she said. By this time, Conte 
said, Romero was giving more recognizable roles to his
construction worker. Conte explained that it took four hours of 
makeup to transform from woman to ballerina to zombie. 
“They give you what they call appliances," said Conte,
"which are these latex rubber-made things to make it look like 
you have been gnawed at.” Conte's appliances included an 
addition that made it appear that she had had a chunk taken 
out of her cheek, she said, and she also received a bullet hole 
in her neck.
“The interesting thing about doing it and being on a set... 
is that you’re being refreshed every so often,” Conte said. 
"People are coming around and saying, ‘We have to put more 
blood in your bullet hole.’” Perhaps the most unique aspect 
of Conte’s ballerina zombie was the way she walked: She 
achieved a limp by walking with one foot flat and one foot 
en pointe. What’s interesting about Conte's choice to stand 
with one foot en pointe is how much sense it makes, said 
Tina Shackleford, a professor in drama as well as a B-movie 
aficionado. Shackleford explained that if we assume zombies 
have lost a part of their will and a part of their brain power, 
what might be retained are habits — such the feet positions 
in ballet' which to a dancer come naturally.
The appeal of the (partially) dead
While it took four hours to transform Conte into a pirouetting 
undead for Day of the Dead, it doesn't take nearly as long for 
Menold to become "The Professor," the character he plays on 
his weekly show. “My makeup*is very hokey and I can put it 
on in three minutes, but that’s a good thing," said Menold. “I 
have to be able to play music with
it on;
it’s really the classic horror host makeup rather than zombie 
makeup.”
Menold’s love of horror began as a kid; at age eight he bought 
a monster makeup book that helped him perfect a scary 
look. "I would do crazy faces...," he said, "and not just at 
Halloween.”
Part of the excitement of coming out for zombie walks such 
the one to be held on October 29 is getting to dress up as 
something truly ghoulish. That’s some of the appeal for 
English doctoral student Rebecca May, who attended the 
walk in the South Side. May said she has had a love of horror 
since her father accompanied her to haunted houses as a 
child, but this was her first zombie walk.
“My earliest memories are of haunted houses," she said. After 
some time, though, May found herself more afraid of the 
spooky structures: “I would make my dad go through them, 
but then I would make my dad scrupulously tell me every 
detail,” she said.
It’s apparent that fright has its appeal; why else would we 
return again and again to horrific films like The Ring or The 
Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
According to drama professor Michael Chemers, Sigmund 
Freud had a theory about the soothing properties of 
frightening images, zombies in particular. Chemers explained 
that in Freud's theory, humans suffer intellectual discomfort 
when they cannot tell whether the object of their gaze is 
alive or dead. The confusion, said Chemers, is horrific 
in the moment but therapeutic at the long
run according to Freud’s view. "The 
zombie particularly engenders 
this crisis about this confusion 
between the living and the dead,” 
said Chemers. “The zombie

---------------------------------------------------

The lines between zombies and ghouls are no longer distinct, 
it seems. "Arabic folklore meets the Haitian folklore and 
becomes Americanized with Romero,” Chemers said.
Walk like a zombie
embodies tensions about death, about the barrier between 
death and life."
Zombies’ appeal could be rooted in complex theory, but 
it might come from something as simple as their quirky 
characteristics. As far as honor monsters go, zombies are a bit 
different. The appeal for Shackleford comes from their speed. 
“The slowness of them is something that levels the battle a bit. 
You actually can outrun them," she said.
Whatever their appeal, zombies have been a large part of 
movie-making throughout the years. Films like The White 
Zombie, made in 1932, helped to begin the tradition of the 
undead in film. From there it has grown, and today video 
games like Resident Evil, and the Sega Genesis game Zombies 
Ate My Neighbors have taken up the chant for brains. So at 
the time of Night of the Living Dead, walking corpses were not 
particularly new. Interestingly enough, the creatures in Night 
weren’t even called zombies; according to Chemers they are 
referred to as ghouls throughout.
creatures out of the movies and into the streets.
Menold, for one, believes that since Romero’s genre-defining 
films took place here, Pittsburgh is also a prime location for 
the zombie walk. Even if he and his zombies fail to break the 
record, they will be carrying on a Pittsburgh tradition; this is a 
city full of rich zombie history. Whether you’re going to hunker 
down with a scary movie or dress up and call for "brains," 
remember to give a toast to Pittsburgh: a drinking town with a 
zombie problem.
He explained that traditionally a zombie is controlled by a 
person or some other force from outside the actor. This, he 
said, has its roots in Haitian voodoo beliefs that told that 
priests or priestesses could wake the dead, at which point the 
walking dead would be completely under the will of the priest 
or priestess. Ghouls, conversely, come from Arabic folklore that 
defines a ghoul as a creature that humans are transformed to 
when they eat the flesh of the dead.

Big Al’s Metal Shop
Metal is sacred musicOn alt-country music
For many of us, creativity is something mysterious, 
present only in short bursts. Sometimes, after staring 
at a problem for hours, the solution magically appears, 
dancing before our eyes. Certainly that has been the 
case in my other line of work. With time, these bursts 
become prolonged and more common. Then, the real 
discoveries begin. The expert within is unleashed, and 
you become a master. Usually, a decade or so passes 
between picking up your tools and really learning how 
to use them. -If you don’t believe me, think back, say, 
five years, and look at how you can usé algebra now 
or how you can form an. argument within a paragraph. . 
Now imagine sticking with that graft for two, three, or 
even four decades.
The belief that talent alone separates geniuses, 
whether musical or mathematical, from the rest of 
us is incomplete. Some of our best work is indeed 
completed in our 20s, but not all of it. Take the Stones, 
for example. Some may say that they should have hung 
it up after Some Girls or maybe even Exile on Main 
Street. But if you take off the rose-colored nostalgia 
glasses, their latest A Bigger Bang stands solidly 
alongside their earlier albums. The arrangement and 
lyrics all show the tandem of Jagger/Richards is as 
sharp as ever. The same can be said of Robert Plant's 
latest as well.
As metal enters its fourth decade, one can now say 
that we have a large enough body of work to label 
some “geniuses." Among the obvious choices from 
Birmingham, England; Florida; and New York, I 
nominate a certain Brasilian named Max Cavalera.
A decade ago, when Sepultura was arguably at its 
peak, Cavalera and his group released an album that 
redefined metal and who could play it. Mixing tribal 
music with drum-based metal seems obvious now, 
but in the mid-'90s it was a commercial risk without 
guaranteed dividends. In fact, it could have ruined 
the band's and its label's credibility. But what the 
group was able to achieve was groundbreaking, and 
it showed that metal is truly a global phenomenon. 
Leaving the group shortly after the obligatory world 
tour, Cavalera set out to further define his vision with 
his own group, Soulfly. To me, one sign of genius 
is people who can seek out talent to complement 
theirs, sometimes with raw talent surpassing their 
own. The musicians that have accompanied Cavalera 
reflect that. With Marc Rizzo in lead guitar, Cavalera 
has concentrated on what can only be described as 
composing metal masterpieces.
Whether it is flamenco, bossa nova, samba, or tribal 
percussion that's infused into the sonic assault of 
metal, this peanut butter/chocolate mix works in 
Cavalera’s arrangement. Furthermore, it works in a 
sweaty pit of aggressive beasts looking for an outlet. 
This is what I witnessed last month at Mr. Small's in 
Millvale.
Combining a natural charm with a commanding 
presence that most lead singers would give their left 
testicle for, Cavalera still looked visibly older than even
a few years ago, and certainly since the Roots days.
The stress accompanying the split with Sepultura, 
along with setting up a new entity and coupled with 
tragic personal losses seems to be reflected in his face. 
However, his energy and “sympatico" nature have 
remained, and his insertion of the crowd-firing “Roots" 
in the middle of the set is proof. Pulling a young fan out 
to sing and beat a few drums with him during the set 
with all the other members shows all the young'uns 
how to connect with an audience. And laying back and 
letting Rizzo shred in solos shows his grace and love for 
the music itself.
All of these are characteristics of a wis^r, mature 
musician, but his true genius lies in his studio work 
and the field work he does in gathering intruments 
from Bosnia and Russia to the Amazon, and 
everywhere in between to create the sounds in his 
head. Watching any of his home videos, you see the 
professorial bent in his eyes as he tracks down the 
sounds he needs to fulfill the mental recipes he has.
In doing so, he creates hidden gems on albums, like 
the last track “Zumbi” on 3, or any of the interludes on 
Prophecy.
A large part of that genius is also reflected in his 
selection of opening bands. No more evident is that 
than his choice of Full Blown Chaos. If you haven’t 
read this column before, suffice it to say that they are 
aptly named. As the mix of world music and metal led 
the scene a decade ago, the confluence of metal and 
hardcore, a thoroughly American invention, is leading 
the scene today. One of the leading lights is indeed 
FBC. These New Yorkers know their roots and have 
a great lead man in Ray Mazzoli. The songwriting is 
tight, but the band’s musicianship is tighter, and they 
are truly a live band. Obviously younger than Cavalera, 
they match his personality well, with the guitarist 
sticking his hand out to everyone in the crowd after 
the set, not just shaking hands, but actually meeting 
people. Their energy certainly set the tone for Soulfly, 
and dare I say challenged them to put on the best show 
I’ve seen them put on in years.
If you haven’t checked out a good metal band or two in 
a while, I eagerly recommend Dark Ages, by Soulfy, a 
thrash metal nightmare for our millennium, and Wake - 
The Demons or anything else by Full Blown Chaos. For 
that matter, check out anything on Stillborn records 
too. And as always, support live metal in this city and 
around the world.
Cheers, and Up The Irons,

i apologize in advance to anyone I offend, but most modern country 
music is simply terrible. I’m sorry that I don't care about your dog or 
how your wife left with your truck. That said, I admit that I am a fan 
of alternative (alt) country, and it’s definitely worth your time to check 
it out.
The general consensus is that alt-country came about through two 
different influences. On one side we have the traditional American 
country music. Examples of this range from Woody Guthrie to Hank 
Williams, both amazing artists worthy of their own Paperhouse 
columns. On the other side we have the country-rock style that 
originated from the re-emergence of rock and roll with country.
The artist best identified with this style is Gram Parsons, who 
released two great albums before his untimely death. As a frame 
of reference, I would classify the legendary Man In Black, Johnny 
Cash, as somewhere between the two. Skip ahead from the 1960s 
to 1990, when the band Uncle Tupelo released No Depression, 
the first widely recognized modern alternative country album. From 
there, alt-country began to take off. Many different groups and 
individuals began to embrace the style; its influence can be seen 
in groups like Camper Van Beethoven, whose lead singer formed 
another group worth a listen, Cracker. Jeff Tweedy, of Uncle Tupelo, 
* went on to form Wilco, whose early albums are steeped in alt- 
country stytings.
Today there are many artists who embrace this style; Bright Eyes 
is one of the more well known. Other examples include the Old 
97s, Whiskeytown (a now-defunct band led by Ryan Adams) and 
The Elected (with Blake Sennett and Jason Boesel of Rilo Kiley). 
Albums released in the past year include Rabbit Fur Coat, by Jenny 
Lewis (of Rilo Kiley) with the Watson Twins; Fox Confessor Brings 
the Flood, by the reigning queen of alt-country Neko Case; and 
more recently Post-War by M. Ward, though his style leans closer to 
traditional Americana.
To all the country fans out there, give alt-country a listen — trust 
me when I say that it’s better than what you’re listening to. And to 
everyone who hates on country, twangy music ain’t all that bad.

This fall, many Carnegie Mellon 
students and faculty members 
were unable to purchase tickets 
to see House of Blue Leaves, one 
of three plays in the School of 
Drama's 2006-2007 series.

The drama behind drama?
Tickets are scarce this season, leaving students scrambling
On the campus of Carnegie Mellon, the diversity of 
students’ abilities and passions lends itself to a wide array of 
opportunities for entertainment and exploration year-round. 
Drastically different majors can come together to make strides 
in various fields — take the roboceptionist, which brought 
together robotics students and drama students. The School 
of Drama, currently presenting House of Blue Leaves, is a 
vital contributor to the overall diversity on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus.
Musical theater students and drama design majors alike 
work on shows throughout the year. Romeo and Juliet and 
The Oresteia Project are just two examples of performances 
to come in the 2006-2007 season. However, House of Blue 
Leaves, written by John Guare and directed by Karen 
Carpenter, is currently causing quite a stir. It is causing 
students, faculty, and Pittsburgh community members to 
wonder, "What’s with the drama behind drama?"
The conflict concerns many of the School of Drama’s 
supporters, who claim that they have been unable to purchase 
tickets to see House of Blue Leaves despite a history of 
interest in performances at Carnegie Mellon. Criticizing 
the heads of the drama box office for not reserving enough 
student tickets, many are questioning their ability to 
patronize the School of Drama without the ability to view
— and tell others about — its shows.
According to the School of Drama, the main reason that the 
scarcity of tickets has drawn so much attention is that House 
of Blue Leaves is being housed in a theater unusual for CFA 
performances. The show is located at the Helen Wayne Rauh 
Studio Theater, rather than the usual, larger venue of the 
Philip Chosky Theater. The use of the smaller space is due 
in part to "curriculum changes" in the School of Drama, said 
Maria Stoy, the School of Drama’s box office manager. The 
Chosky Theatre has a capacity of 430, but the Rauh Studio 
can manage an audience of only 120 for each of the 10 shows. 
It is this smaller number of available seats that, at least in 
part, contributed to a deficit of tickets. According to the 
box office records, House of Blue Leaves sold out by mid- 
September.
Susan Tsu, a professor of costume design, acknowledged the 
difficulty of satisfying a demand for tickets within the confines 
of a small performance space. "Since this is the first year we 
are doing a fully mounted advertised production in the Rauh 
Theatre, we have indeed run up against some challenges,” 
she stated in an e-mail.
Tsu appears to be in the minority, as many faculty members 
of the School of Drama seem unaware that their students feel 
disadvantaged. Stoy explained that the majority of tickets 
purchased go to those with season subscriptions — usually 
off-campus community members. Only a small percentage of
the subscribers are students or faculty members.
When students voiced their dissatisfaction, the box office 
listened. Dick Block, the associate head of the School of 
Drama, explained that several steps were taken in response 
to registered complaints. The School of Drama struggled to 
find ways to make the most of the Rauh Studio. Block said, 
"The last two rehearsals [as of October 13] were opened up for 
students. A bank of seats was added to increase the number 
in the audience.” He continued, "The box office keeps a 
waiting list so that [seats of] cancelled tickets will be used."
So is there really drama in the School of Drama? None that is 
intentional. The School of Drama and the box office are not 
doing anything to restrict the access of any Carnegie Mellon 
students. According to Block, "We encourage our students 
to see as many of our productions as they can and we do 
everything we can to make it possible. There would be no 
reason for the School of Drama to deny our students access to 
the work that their colleagues are doing.”
"House of Blue Leaves" had its last show October 14 in the 
Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theater.

major: architecture 
year: 2008+ 
birthday: January 9,1987
hobbies: eating Asian food, 
jewelry design, listening to 
music, playing video games 
(RPG, fighter, platform, 
action), practicing/playing 
guitar, reading comic books, 
singing, sleeping in, 
watching poorly dubbed/ 
subtitled foreign martial arts 
movies
About The Comic: Untitled.dwg has an eclectic rainbow of characters 
(99% of whom are fellow archies), but the main character is based on 
me. The “storyline,” if you can call it that, is a retelling of things that 
have actually happened...Through my eyes, that is. I have a pretty weird 
way of perceiving the world around me. Everything’s animated, and I’ve 
heard people say that I act like a cartoon character at times: I’m a tiny 
(5T) Asian girl who wears big platform shoes, executes overexaggerated 
gestures, has constant drama in her life, and maintains a love/hate 
relationship with her architectural passion. It helps that I have crazy 
friends and family who I love to draw!
Your choice to drink milk past the expiration date will result in missing 
your midterm this week. Trust me, you don’t want to know why.
Decision time! Do you spend your money on a PS3 or Wii, or go on a 
amazing trip over winter break? Either way you’ll have the time to enjoy 
yourself because you’re currently failing out of school.
I’m sorry to say this, but the stapler you let someone borrow is never 
coming back. You can look on your desk all you want, but it's gone. I 
recommend buying a new one and stapling it to your wrist. So I guess 
you’d better buy two.
Man, eating an entire box of Cap’n Crunch would really hit the spot 
right now. If you set yourself the goal of acquiring some, it will totally 
make your day.
Your planned picnic will get rained out this week. Unfortunately, the 
sun is getting ready to leave Pittsburgh and you won't have a chance 
to try again until April. This is actually a blessing in disguise because a 
vengeful turtle would have ruined the whole experience.
You procrastinated another day away and are starting to get really 
nervous. Your parents are going to get your midterm grades soon, so 
talk to your friends, your advisor, or someone who could get you out 
of the country.
Your excuse that something must be wrong with your e-mail, which is 
why your professor hasn’t been recieving assingments, is starting to 
stretch thin. Try sending him an e-mail with random text, and claim that 
the message must have gotten corrupted.
Your parents turned your room into a personal space for them. New 
accommodations include: a hot tub, an HDTV, stocked bar, and really 
comfortable couches. Unfortunately, they also installed a lock on the 
door. Welcome home! Enjoy the basement!
Don’t read this as you walk around campus because there’s a good 
chance you’re going to trip. You won’t get hurt, but you look pretty 
stupid. I mean, just look at that guy over there. Ouch, that looked rather 
painful. Are you bleeding?
Your diet of ramen noodles and ketchup packets is starting to affect 
your ability to, well, live. Try upgrading to mayonnaise and sugar 
cubes.
You misplaced the number of the cute girl you met on Friday night. 
Despite your best efforts, you won’t find it, because your roommate 
was the one who took it. They seem really happy together, though.
Don't cry over spilled milk. It is however okay to feel bad about the 
consequent electrical fire. On the plus side, you’ll be granted a 24-hour 
extension on your networks deadline.
