President Suresh elected to Institute of Medicine
CHRIS GALVIN
Junior Staffwriter
The Institute of Medicine 
honored President Subra 
Suresh by electing him as a 
member of the institute in 
recognition of his research in 
cell mechanics on Oct. 21.
This honor from the Insti-
tute of Medicine, in addition 
to Suresh’s previous honors 
from the National Academy 
of Sciences and the National 
Academy of Engineering, 
make Suresh one of 16 Ameri-
cans to be elected to all three 
national academies.
“Being in all three acad-
emies is a very small group 
of people, and I am particu-
larly pleased that it happened 
while I am at CMU, because 
CMU is very well known for 
interdisciplinary research and 
that is what I practiced over 
the last many years,” Suresh 
said.
Suresh is the only cur-
rent university president and 
?rst Carnegie Mellon faculty 
member to have earned this 
recognition.
 Including Suresh, there 
are 41 Carnegie Mellon fac-
ulty members who are mem-
bers of the National Academy 
of Engineering, 11 in the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, 
and four in the Institute of 
Medicine.
“It was a pleasant surprise. 
I feel very honored, especially 
being an engineer, to be in-
cluded in the medical com-
munity [because] biomedi-
cal work is very satisfying,” 
Suresh continued.
The Institute of Medicine is 
an independent organization 
that seeks to “provide expert 
advice on some of the most 
pressing challenges facing the 
nation and the world, helping 
to shape policies, inform pub-
lic opinion, and advance the 
pursuit of science, engineer-
ing and medicine,” as stated 
on the organization’s website.
Speaking of the Institute 
and the National Academies, 
Suresh said, “They have a 
unique platform because it’s 
an independent organization 
with people from academia, 
industry, policy, et cetera. 
They are often asked by gov-
ernment to provide advice, 
and when they provide ad-
vice, they get attention, be-
cause it’s an honori?c soci-
ety.”
“For example, the Insti-
tute of Medicine came out 
with a report on a number 
of diseases, including topics 
such as obesity in the country, 
what policies should be there, 
things like Alzheimer’s, brain 
diseases,” Suresh said. 
“As a member, you are 
likely to be invited more to

News Co-Editor
“Carnegie Mellon released 
its annual drug and alcohol 
brochure, which highlighted 
the school’s policies regard-
ing drug and alcohol use, last 
Monday.
In a foreword in the bro-
chure, President Subra Suresh 
wrote, “While the university 
maintains strict policies re-
garding the illegal use of al-
cohol and drugs, we also offer 
help for any individual who 
is experiencing substance use 
dif?culties.”
According to the Fire and 
Safety Report released earlier 
in the semester, 42 liquor law 
arrests, 17 disciplinary actions 
with respect to liquor laws, 
and 10 drug law arrests oc-
curred at Carnegie Mellon last 
year.
Dean of Student Affairs 
Gina Casalegno emphasized 
that alcohol is allowed for stu-
dents of legal drinking age in 
dormitory rooms; however, it 
is prohibited in all exclusively 
?rst-year student dorms. The 
only upperclassmen alcohol-
free residence is Henderson

Health survey gathers data on stress
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
News Co-Editor
Carnegie Mellon students 
were recently asked to take a 
health survey that requested 
information on a broad range 
of topics that included sexual 
health, stress levels, and phys-
ical activity.
Anita Barkin, director of 
University Health Services, 
sent out an email to the stu-
dent body two weeks ago, ask-
ing students to complete the 
online survey about health-re-
lated experiences at Carnegie 
Mellon. The survey was meant 
to determine “how best to pro-
vide resources to support stu-
dents’ physical and emotional 
well-being.”
This year’s health survey 
focused on mental health and 
student stress levels, accord-
ing to Barkin. In 2007 and 
2009, the last two years that 
a campus-wide health survey 
was administered, Student 
Health Services used the Na-
tional College Health Assess-
ment (NCHA). The NCHA, 
which is produced by the 
American College Health As-
sociation, focuses on health 
areas that college students 
generally struggle with, such 
as sexual health, alcohol, and 
drug usage.
While the NCHA has sever-
al advantages in that it yields 
data that can be compared 
with a national body of univer-
sity students, Barkin wanted 
the survey at Carnegie Mellon 
this year to also focus on other 
areas.
“We looked at the informa-
tion and the data being col-
lected [by the NCHA] and said 
‘you know what? We want to 
do something that’s a little bit 
different.’ We want to make 
sure they’re addressing some 
of the issues that have been 
raised over the past year re-
garding stress,” she said.
Director of the Of?ce of In-
stitutional Research and Anal-
ysis Janel Sutkus compared 
the survey in some ways to the 
“CMU Says” survey, a similar 
health survey, administered 
two years ago.
“We’ve never really done 
a measure of stress and stress 
management,” she said. “In 
the CMU Says survey two 
years ago we looked at sleep, 
we looked at physical ?tness, 
we look eating habits. In the 
past National College Health 
Assessment, we looked at 
sexual activity and alcohol 
and drug use. The stress level, 
the stress management, those 
pieces are new.”

Professor of computer sci-
ence and dean of the School of 
Computer Science Randal Bry-
ant announced his plan to step 
down at the end of his term 
from his position as dean last 
Monday.
Bryant’s 10-year term as 
dean of SCS will expire on 
June 30, 2014. Computer sci-
ence professor Guy Blelloch 
will be heading the committee 
in charge of ?nding a replace-
ment for Bryant.
Bryant, who ?rst became 
dean in 2004, wrote in an 
email to members of SCS, 
“It’s been a wonderful experi-
ence for me to serve as dean. 
I’ve gotten to work with many 
creative and capable people 
on projects ranging from new 
research initiatives and new 
educational programs to im-
proved outreach to our alumni 
and supporters.”
“I’ve been able to ride in 
autonomous vehicles, walk 
around muddy construction 
sites, and meet with alumni 
and friends of SCS all around 
the world. I’ve especially en-
joyed meeting the families of 
our students at graduation, 
sharing with them the excite-
ment of our students’ achieve-
ments. I would like to thank 
every one of you for having 
made this such a reward-
ing experience for me,” he 
continued.
Bryant’s previous work in-
cluded research concerning 
data intensive, distributed 
computing techniques, ac-
cording to Bryant’s pro?le on 
the School of Computer Sci-
ence website.
Bryant also co-authored 
the textbook Computer Sys-
tems: A Programmer’s Perspec-
tive, a work that originated 
from the introductory com-
puter systems course that 
Bryant and his co-author and 
professor of computer science 
Dave O’Hallaron developed in 
1998, called Introduction to 
Computer Systems.
Bryant was awarded the 
Emanuel R. Piore Award from 
the Institute of Electronics and 
Electrical Engineers (IEEE), 
for his “developing methods 
of reasoning about digital cir-
cuits using ordered binary de-
cision diagrams,” according to 
the IEEE website.
Bryant plans to take a one-
year sabbatical following the 
end of his term, and then re-
turn to his duties as a profes-
sor of computer science.
As dean, Bryant was instru-
mental in fostering research in 
data-intensive computing.
“In the meantime, there’s 
plenty to do between now and 
June 30, and I look forward to 
continuing to work with you,” 
he wrote.

Professor of statistics and 
dean of the Dietrich College 
of Humanities and Social Sci-
ences (DC) John Lehoczky 
announced the end of his 14-
year term as dean on Oct. 18. 
Lehoczky will continue his 
duties as professor of statis-
tics in the next academic year.
Professor of applied lin-
guistics Richard Tucker will 
head the search committee to 
replace Lehoczky.
Executive Vice President 
and Provost Mark Kamlet said 
in an email to the DC commu-
nity, “John has been a truly 
extraordinary dean under 
whose leadership the college 
has moved forward strongly 
across its entire range of 
activities.”
“Through his commit-
ment, dedication, and en-
gagement, the college has 
enhanced greatly Carnegie 
Mellon University’s reputa-
tion as a great university 
through its research and 
education programs in the 
humanities and the social sci-
ences. John has also been a 
tremendous campus leader 
far beyond the college per se. 
His experience and wisdom 
have helped guide the univer-
sity for many years,” Kamlet 
continued.
Lehoczky’s main research 
interests involve the theory of 
stochastic processes, which is 
the evolution of random phe-
nomena over time, and the 
use of stochastic processes 
to model real-world applica-
tions, according to his pro?le 
on the Carnegie Mellon statis-
tics website.
Joining the Carnegie Mel-
lon statistics faculty in 1969, 
Lehoczky had a vision for 
Dietrich College to “develop 
novel research projects and 
education programs in the so-
cial sciences and humanities 
that will enhance Carnegie 
Mellon’s reputation as a great 
university,” according to the 
Dietrich College website.
After earning his Ph.D. 
from Stanford University, 
Lehoczky contributed his 
knowledge about applica-
tions of stochastic modeling 
to problems in ?nance, lead-
ing to the creation of Carn-
egie Mellon’s unique master’s 
degree program in computa-
tional ?nance.
According to the Dietrich 
College website, Lehoczky 
worked to ramp up Carnegie 
Mellon’s humanities program 
during his tenure as dean. 
This effort included over-
seeing the launch of the Hu-
manities Initiative, which 
founded the Humanities 
Scholars Program, the Hu-
manities Center, and the Cen-
ter for the Arts in Society. 
“Students 
reported high 
levels of stress, 
the problem 
was that we 
didn’t have 
follow up 
questions.”

The National Science 
Foundation has awarded 
Carnegie Mellon researchers 
more than $7 million for vari-
ous robot projects. The grant 
money is expected to be used 
towards projects that build 
and develop robots that can 
optimize and assist human 
tasks.
“The great promise of ro-
bots is to extend human skills 
and enhance human lives,” 
said Matt Mason, director of 
the Carnegie Mellon Robot-
ics Institute, according to a 
university press release. “The 
National Robotics Initiative is 
helping researchers here at 
Carnegie Mellon and across 
the country make that prom-
ise a reality.” 
One of the new projects 
is expected to be a multiple-
university, interdisciplinary 
scheme using robots to better 
assess the status of decrepit 
bridges.
Various groups will be in 
charge of the bridge project, 
including Carnegie Mellon’s 
Robotics Institute and civil 
and environmental engineer-
ing departments, as well as 
Northeastern University.
Another project will look 
to develop robots that can aid 
in low-risk surgeries by using 
sensory information to guide 
them. 
Researchers hope to have 
compensated for surgeons 
not being able to see organs 
during surgeries.
Other projects include us-
ing robots and creating 3-D 
maps of internal organs to 
help the visually impaired 
travel, assist stroke survivors 
with their mobility, respond 
to underground mine acci-
dents, and more.
Carnegie Mellon Researchers Granted $7 Million by National Science Foundation
Ilic’s Team Awarded $1.2 Million Grant
Marija D. Ilic, professor of 
electrical and computer en-
gineering and engineering 
and public policy, has been 
chosen to lead a multidisci-
plinary research team aim-
ing to prove that it is feasible 
to economically and depend-
ably provide electric power.
According to a univer-
sity press release, Ilic plans 
on executing her research 
project “with careful design 
of IT-enabled, data-driven 
protocols and the introduc-
tion of more interactive 
binding protocols between 
traditional utilities and new 
technologies.” 
Using a $1.2 million grant 
that is spread over three 
years, Ilic will test the intel-
ligent Dynamic Monitor-
ing and Decision Systems 
(iDyMonDS) to prove that a 
more dependable, cost effec-
tive smart grid technology 
system can be created.
“This hybrid setup has 
the potential to realistically 
mimic a large electric energy 
system with data collected 
from real-world instrumen-
tation that would ultimately 
be able to help determine 
the value of new technolo-
gies and their impact on the 
quality and cost of electricity 
services, sustainability and 
potential for reducing pollu-
tion,” Ilic said.
Her team has already cre-
ated a database for electric 
power grids in two volca-
nic islands, Flores and San 
Miguel, and used the data to 
determine how community 
members can best utilize 
cheaper, more eco-friendly 
energy from wind.
According to a university 
press release, Ilic has recently 
been recognized by Carnegie 
Mellon with a Philip L. Dowd 
Fellowship Award. She has 
also established the Electrical 
Energy Systems Group.

participate in some of these 
studies. You can play a role in 
service to the country ... as a 
member of these academies.”
Suresh was recognized by 
the Institute of Medicine for 
his research in cell mechan-
ics related to blood diseases, 
malaria, and certain types of 
cancer. His research explores 
the ability of cells to deform 
and how changes in this abil-
ity can lead to disease.
“The idea behind this is if 
you look at biological cells, 
especially human cells like 
red blood cells, there are 
physical properties and me-
chanical properties that are 
very important for health,” he 
said. “If something happens, 
either through environment 
or genetic defect that causes 
the cell to compromise its 
abilities, then it will affect the 
way the normal functioning 
of the body will take place.”
Suresh explained how this 
can cause different problems 
in different diseases. 
In sickle cell anemia and 
malaria, the cell’s deform-
ability is compromised; and 
that compromises the func-
tion of the cell.
Meanwhile, in certain 
types of cancer like pancre-
atic cancer, the easier it is for 
the cell to deform, the faster 
the cancer can metastasize 
and spread.
“For different diseases, it’s 
a different outcome, that’s 
the connection. And that’s 
the connection that’s not be-
ing studied at the cell level, 
because the tools you need to 
study them are very sophisti-
cated using nanotechnology, 
computational modeling, and 
those tools that have been in 
place only in the last 10–15 
years,” Suresh said.
Raymond J. Lane, Chair-
man of the Carnegie Mel-
lon Board of Trustees, called 
Suresh’s research, “work at 
the intersection of engineer-
ing, the sciences, and medi-
cine,” in an email to the Carn-
egie Mellon community.
“[President Suresh] is tru-
ly a scientist and educational 
leader for our time. He em-
bodies, through his individu-
al scholarship as well as insti-
tutional, national, and global 
leadership, Carnegie Mellon’s 
commitment to cross bound-
aries to transform lives,” Lane 
said.
Suresh will elaborate 
more on his research at his 
seminar “Crossing Boundar-
ies, Transforming Lives: The 
Study of Human Diseases at 
the Crossroads of Engineer-
ing, Science, and Medicine” 
on Nov. 7 at 4:30 p.m. in 
McConomy Auditorium.

Barkin hopes that this sur-
vey will provide a richer data 
set for understanding how 
students deal with stress; 
“We know that students re-
ported high levels of stress, 
the problem was that we 
didn’t have follow up ques-
tions,” Barkin said.
Sutkus wants the survey 
to focus on how stress and 
stress management is affect-
ed by key aspects of health 
like sleep levels and eating 
habits.
“The relationships be-
tween all of these things are 
critically important. I would 
like to understand the re-
lationship between sleep 
and stress management and 
physical ?tness so we can 
report back to the students, 
‘look, this is what you told us, 
these are some of the healthy 
behaviors and these are some 
of the less healthy behaviors. 
Now that we’ve learned this 
and you’ve told us what ser-
vices are important to you, 
we can make decisions about 
what gets enhanced and 
what’s not being utilized.’ ”
Lucy Havens, a junior in-
formation systems major, 
said she appreciated that 
the university was trying to 
address Carnegie Mellon’s 
stress culture. 
“I think students know 
that stress here is a problem, 
so it’s nice to know that the 
school is trying to address 
that. I appreciate the fact that 
they have the survey in the 
?rst place,” she said. 
The survey itself, Barkin 
said, was created mostly by 
Sutkus.
According to Sutkus, the 
survey looked at student 
health in three major ar-
eas: physical health, mental 
health, and stress levels. 
The survey asked ques-
tions designed to address 
how these three major health 
areas interact with other 
aspects of student health, 
including sleep, sexual 
health, physical ?tness, al-
cohol and drug use, nutri-
tion and eating habits, and 
stress management.
Sutkus said that the infor-
mation from the survey will 
be used to allocate resources 
within the university to ad-
dress student needs.
 “We can look at the kinds 
of resources we offer and see 
if they’re meeting students’ 
needs,” Sutkus said.
While Sutkus will be 
analyzing the data from the 
survey herself, she will pro-
vide the results to various 
divisions of the university, 
including the Athletics De-
partment and Counseling 
and Psychological Services 
(CAPS).
“We have been working 
very closely with other areas 
on campus, so I spent a lot 
of time with [Interim Direc-
tor of Athletics] Josh Centor 
and [Director of CAPS] Kurt 
Kumler to get some of the 
language around these areas. 
They will be the recipients 
of some of the results, along 
with folks like [Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs] Gina Casalegno, 
[Vice Provost for Education] 
Amy Burkert, and lots of folks 
from student affairs and aca-
demic advising.”
Barkin mentioned that it’s 
important to look not just at 
students with unhealthy hab-
its but also students who are 
managing their health well. 
“You know, the important 
thing, too, is not only to un-
derstand behaviors that are 
potentially not healthy, but 
[also to understand] those 
students who are doing very 
well. What does that look 
like? What does our well stu-
dent look like? Because there 
are things we can learn from 
that as well,” she said. 
While the 2007 NCHA 
received a response rate of 
about 24 percent, Barkin 
said, she hopes that this 
year’s survey will be taken by 
more students. 
Sutkus said that they are 
aiming for a response rate of 
between 40 and 45 percent, 
and are already halfway to 
their goal. This total also in-
cludes graduate students at 
Carnegie Mellon, who have 
never been included in a cam-
pus health survey before this 
year.
Student Health Services 
is incentivizing the survey 
with coupons for a free fro-
zen yogurt dessert at Skibo 
Cafe and a chance to win a 
Healthy U stadium blanket or 
free meal block at a campus 
dining location.
The survey, which began 
on Oct. 17, will end between 
Nov. 1 and Nov. 6. Students 
can take the survey online via 
the link in Barkin’s campus-
wide email.

ior that might be disturbing 
the community or violating 
university policy. It is up to a 
student to allow entry to his or 
her room with the exception 
of life safety concerns, which 
positions us to enter a room to 
respond.”
The university maintains 
its strict policy prohibiting il-
legal substances on campus.  
     Casalegno said, “Any alle-
gation that university policy is 
violated is taken seriously and 
thoughtfully handled through 
our community standards 
process. Illicit drug use intro-
duces an element of risk to 
the safety and welfare of the 
university community, and 
will be dealt with accordingly. 
In all our efforts to respond to 
reports of drug or alcohol use, 
education about the individu-
al ... are of paramount impor-
tance in our process.”
The amnesty policy allow-
ing students with intoxicated 
peers to seek help will contin-
ue to be in effect. The amnesty 
policy was ?rst implemented 
at Carnegie Mellon in the 
late 1990s when incidents of 
intoxication requiring medi-
cal attention became more 
prevalent.
“It is not the university’s 
prerogative to assert the am-
nesty procedure off campus 
in jurisdictions where we 
do not have police author-
ity. I think high-risk drinking 
poses a risk to students, and 
urge students, regardless of 
where they are, to seek help 
for themselves or their peers 
whenever someone exhibits 
signs of alcohol intoxication 
that warrants medical atten-
tion,” Casalegno said.

How do bats maneuver in 
the dark? How do dolphins 
make their way through the 
ocean? Echolocation is a 
biological sonar used by mi-
crochiropteran bats, odon-
tocetes (toothed whales and 
dolphins), and some cave-
dwelling bird species as a 
means of navigation in envi-
ronments where vision is not 
very useful. 
The basic concept behind 
echolocation is that the ani-
mal emits calls then listens to 
the echoes of its calls bounc-
ing off nearby objects, the 
same way you might hear 
your own voice echo back in a 
cave or canyon. When the ani-
mal calls out, it causes vibra-
tions in the air. These changes 
in the air affect surrounding 
particles and cause them to 
vibrate as well, resulting in 
a chain reaction, known as a 
sound wave, that can travel 
very long distances. When 
this sound wave hits another 
object, the particles are de-
?ected in the opposite direc-
tion and the wave returns to 
the caller.
HowStuffWorks.com ex-
plains how bats use this ability 
to ?nd prey in the dark. Most 
bats make calls higher in pitch 
than humans can hear. When 
the echo returns to the bat, 
the time delay helps it process 
how far away the object is. 
Even more amazing, however, 
is the way bats can determine 
which direction the object is 
moving and how big it is. The 
bat can tell the direction the 
object is moving by compar-
ing whether the sound reach-
es its right or left ear ?rst — if 
the sound reaches the right 
ear ?rst, for example, the ob-
ject must be on the right side 
of the bat. In addition to the 
object’s horizontal position, 
the bat can determine if the 
object is above or below it by 
using special folds on its outer 
ear. These sensitive folds al-
low the bat to feel if the sound 
wave hits the lower or upper 
part of its ear.
The bat can also determine 
the size of the object by the in-
tensity of the echo. Because a 
smaller object will re?ect the 
sound wave less, the return-
ing echo will be softer. If the 
echo is louder, the object is 
obviously larger. The bat can 
even use the Doppler effect to 
conclude if the object is mov-
ing away from or toward it. If 
the object is moving toward 
the bat, the peaks and troughs 
of the sound wave will seem 
closer together, causing the 
echo to have a higher pitch. 
Similarly, if the object is 
moving away from the bat, 
the wave will appear to be 
more spread out, and the cor-
responding frequency will 
cause the echo's pitch to be 
lower.
Echolocation is a very im-
portant skill for whales and 
dolphins as well. According to 
the Australian government’s 
Department of the Environ-
ment, toothed whales — such 
as killer whales and dolphins 
— use echolocation for hunt-
ing and navigating. However, 
baleen whales, such as hump-
backs and blue whales, use it 
as a form of communication. 
According to the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration, sound is emitted 
in the head region of these sea 
mammals and is focused by 
the melon, a mass of adipose 
(fatty) tissue found in the 
forehead. The echo is then re-
ceived through special tissue 
in the lower jawbone that is 
able to conduct sound. In both 
bats and odontocetes, charac-
teristics of echolocation calls 
differ depending on the envi-
ronment, hunting behavior, 
and type of prey.
While this kind of echo-
location is not innate to hu-
mans, Smithsonian magazine 
con?rmed that humans are 
also capable of echolocation 
and many vision-impaired in-
dividuals have actually devel-
oped the ability over time. 
While humans lack the 
specialized anatomical struc-
tures that bats and odontoce-
tes use to analyze echoes, the 
overall concept of echoloca-
tion is theoretically still pos-
sible. For example, humans 
are capable of making small 
click noises that echo back, 
have a left and right ear to 
distinguish the direction of 
the object, and are able to dif-
ferentiate between volumes to 
determine the distance of the 
object.
Humans could potentially 
replicate echolocation — but 
they would need to determine 
the speed of sound in air, have 
a timer to measure how long 
it takes for the echo to return, 
and use physics equations to 
determine how an object is 
moving. Naturally echolo-
cating animals can do all of 
these calculations purely by 
instinct.

Have you ever played 
your friend in Wii Sports and 
blamed a missed serve or a 
bad shot on the lag of the vid-
eo game? Robert Xiao, a Ph.D. 
student in Carnegie Mellon’s 
Human-Computer Interaction 
Institute (HCII), Chris Harri-
son, a recent Ph.D. graduate 
from the HCII who will be join-
ing the Carnegie Mellon fac-
ulty next year, Scott Hudson, a 
professor in the HCII, and Ivan 
Poupyrev and Karl Willis of Dis-
ney Research Pittsburgh, have 
developed a motion tracking 
technology called Lumitrack, 
which will not only signi?cantly 
decrease the lag that is common 
in many motion tracking tech-
nologies today but also offer 
more precision and lower cost.
According to Xiao, the proj-
ect began when he and his re-
search group discovered that 
mathematical problems could 
be encoded in a way such that 
a very small portion of them 
would be unique across the 
entire pattern, known as the 
m-sequence. “We got the no-
tion that this could be used for 
tracking somehow,” Xiao said. 
“You could display this pattern 
in some way and then identify 
where you are on it.”
Lumitrack consists of two 
main components: projec-
tors and sensors. The system 
projects a unique m-sequence, 
which is essentially a big bar-
code, onto a linear optical sen-
sor somewhere in the ?eld of 
view. The sensor then picks 
up individual pixels of this 
barcode pattern and decodes 
it into the position within the 
pattern. For motion tracking 
in three dimensions, an ad-
ditional projector and sensor 
pair are added to the system. 
“So basically we set up an 
image from the projector that 
is this barcode, in two direc-
tions — one barcode in one 
direction and a different bar-
code in a different direction —
and the sensors are sitting in 
this ?eld with x and y sensors 
that can just pick up that bar-
code,” Xiao said. The system 
is also extremely precise: “We 
can track the position of the 
sensor down to 1.3 millime-
ters, at the worst,” Xiao said.
The design of this system 
allows the sensors to pick up 
locations in a short amount 
of time because light can be 
tracked quickly. Existing mo-
tion tracking technologies, 
such as Nintendo’s Wii Re-
mote or Microsoft’s Kinect, use 
full cameras on their sensors, 
which result in a lot of extra 
processing time. 
“Lumitrack, by comparison, 
is quite simple. Because of the 
use of the barcode, we can just 
look up the position in the bar-
code. It’s basically just a simple 
table look-up,” Xiao said. 
The fact that Lumitrack 
uses one-dimensional sensors 
means that it does not have a 
lot of data to deal with. 
“We process the data using 
a very fast, very ef?cient algo-
rithm, and then ship it off. The 
simplicity of the system ends 
up being its greatest strength,” 
Xiao said. This simplicity also 
results in a lower cost overall, 
since Lumitrack requires only 
a few sensors and projectors.
Other applications of this 
system include gesture con-
trol and computer-generated 
imagery (CGI) for ?lms. In the 
case of gesture control, Lumi-
track has the potential to per-
form even better than other 
current technologies, such as 
the Leap Motion Controller. 
As for CGI, very expensive 
and large systems are usu-
ally required. However, us-
ing Lumitrack, CGI would 
be achieved using much less 
equipment and at a lower cost, 
making it more accessible to 
ordinary people.
Xiao and his team recently 
attended the 2013 Associa-
tion for Computing Machinery 
Symposium on User Interface 
Software and Technology in 
Scotland. “I got an opportunity 
to present my research there to 
the wider community and get 
them excited about the pos-
sibilities that we could have,” 
Xiao said. While Lumitrack is 
still a research prototype at the 
moment, commercial vendors  
interested in creating a product 
have reached out to the Carn-
egie Mellon group. Xiao pre-
dicts that in three years, Lumi-
track could be commercialized, 
transforming motion tracking 
systems into real-time experi-
ences.

Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon University have col-
laborated with scientists from 
the Army Research Labo-
ratory; Pennsylvania State 
University; the University of 
California, Davis; the Univer-
sity of California, Riverside; 
and Indiana University to 
develop methods for comput-
ers to make security relevant 
decisions in cyberspace. The 
project, called Models for En-
abling Continuous Recon?gu-
rability of Secure Missions, 
strives to increase security in 
cyberspace.
The ?ve-year funding for 
the program is $23.2 million, 
with an additional $25 mil-
lion for an optional ?ve-year 
extension. The Carnegie Mel-
lon branch of the project is 
funded through CyLab, the 
world’s largest university-
based research and educa-
tion center for computer and 
network security, information 
security, and software assur-
ance.
The collaborative research 
focuses on detecting attacks 
in cyberspace, measuring 
and managing risk, and al-
tering the environment to 
optimize results, all while 
minimizing cost. The previ-
ous three objectives will be 
reached with help of human 
behavior models that allow 
computers to predict the mo-
tivations of users, defenders, 
and attackers.
The lead researcher from 
Carnegie Mellon, Lorrie 
Cranor, is an associate profes-
sor of computer science and 
engineering and public policy. 
Cranor became involved with 
this project through her pre-
vious work, which also dealt 
with human factors related to 
security and privacy. She was 
recruited for the project team 
by Patrick McDaniel, a profes-
sor of computer science and 
engineering at Penn State and 
the principal investigator on 
this project.
Cranor’s main role is to 
lead the psychosocial team, 
which will be contributing to 
the project by investigating 
psychological and human fac-
tor issues. One of her teams 
developed techniques that 
allowed computers to distin-
guish between real and false 
cyberattacks, which may aid 
the performances of over-
whelmed human analysts. 
Results from this research 
will enable future computing 
systems to take action derived 
from human decision making 
in response to attacks without 
physical human intervention. 
For example, a server observ-
ing unusual network traf-
?c from an unknown entity 
might decide it is under attack 
and ?lter that traf?c.
Despite the project’s seem-
ingly technical nature, it re-
quires a variety of expertise, 
most importantly that of 
people who understand risk, 
game theory, and human 
factor issues, according to 
Cranor. This is because an im-
portant approach to combat-
ing cyberattacks involves un-
derstanding the motivations 
and behaviors of attackers.
Cleotilde Gonzalez, an as-
sociate research professor of 
social and decision sciences 
and director of the Dynamic 
Decision Making Laboratory 
is responsible for many of the 
decision-making aspects of 
the project. Other Carnegie 
Mellon contributors include 
Lujo Bauer and Nicolas Chris-
tin, both assistant research 
professors of electrical and 
computer engineering and  
associated with the CyLab.
Finally, Cranor stresses the 
role of researchers who spe-
cialize in the social sciences. 
“One of the salient aspects of 
our proposed research is in 
the realization that humans 
are integral to maintaining 
cybersecurity and to breaches 
of security,” Cranor said via 
email. “Their behavior and 
cognitive and psychological 
biases have to be integrated 
as much as any other compo-
nent of the system that one is 
trying to secure.”

MICHAEL SETZER
SciTech Editor
On a chilly evening last 
Monday, Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents, faculty, and staff and 
members of the Pittsburgh 
community huddled in the 
Rex Theatre in Pittsburgh’s 
South Side to listen to ?ve in-
dividuals share personal sto-
ries about science. The event 
was co-hosted by Story Col-
lider, a traveling podcast that 
records people’s stories about 
science, and Public Communi-
cation for Researchers (PCR), 
a group of graduate students 
at Carnegie Mellon that focus-
es on communicating science 
to the public.
The stories themselves 
came from ?ve Carnegie Mel-
lon students — four graduate 
students and one undergradu-
ate — covering a range of 
emotions and describing trips 
to rural Pennsylvania, Rwan-
da, Italy, Massachusetts, and 
Pittsburgh.
Story Collider producer 
Erin Barker and co-founder/
director Ben Lillie, who hosted 
the event, squelched any fears 
of a humdrum lecture. “There 
will be no learning tonight,” 
Barker exclaimed. “That is the 
Story Collider promise.”
Victor Hwang
Victor Hwang, a graduate 
student at Carnegie Mellon’s 
Robotics Institute, was a col-
lege senior when he began 
preparing for a job at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pas-
adena, Calif., where had in-
terned the previous summer.
According to Hwang, work-
ing at the JPL was an intense 
change from college life: 
“I went from playing video 
games for ?ve hours a day in 
my underwear to working on 
a $330 million spacecraft for 
my ?rst job as a 22-year-old,” 
he said.
One of his assignments 
involved working on an ex-
tremely complex sequence of 
code for a spacecraft 20 mil-
lion miles away. When it was 
?nally time to implement the 
code, he went to the command 
room to “beam it up.” But after 
a countdown, the spacecraft 
failed to appear on his screen. 
After failing to initially deter-
mine the issue, Hwang began 
to panic. “I imagined a news-
paper headline, ‘22-year-old 
blows up spacecraft, publicly 
shamed by Jean-Luc Picard.’ ”
Eventually, Hwang de-
termined that his only error 
was in simple arithmetic; the 
spacecraft was late to show 
up on the screen, but with 
no damage or repercussions. 
After ?nally settling down, 
Hwang realized the bene?ts of 
having a high-stakes job. “If it 
gets my blood pumping, I can 
tell I’m doing the right thing.”
Miranda Munoz
Miranda Munoz, a sopho-
more biological sciences ma-
jor — and the lone undergrad 
— was next to take the stage. 
When she was in the eighth 
grade, she woke up with a 
headache and received an ini-
tial diagnosis of vertigo; how-
ever, she wasn’t convinced this 
was the problem. After three 
visits to neurologists, she had 
became frustrated and fed 
up. “I hated my brain,” she 
said. She remembered think-
ing, “It’s what makes me who 
I am, but it’s giving me this 
great pain.” As she studied 
the brain more and more, 
she became increasingly in-
trigued by the complex organ.
On Dec. 20, 2010, Munoz’s 
father suffered from a sudden 
stroke. Speaking to a hushed 
audience, Munoz stated, “I 
had never hated the brain as 
much as I did that day.” Her 
father was in a wheelchair and 
had to relearn simple tasks 
such as signing his name and 
taking a few steps.
Ultimately, these experi-
ences led to her passion for 
understanding the brain. “I’ve 
loved the brain and I’ve hated 
the brain. But greater than 
this, I’ve loved the challenges 
of unlocking its mysteries each 
day,” she said.
Avner Maiberg
Avner Maiberg, a graduate 
student in computer science, 
began his tale by introduc-
ing millennium problems — a 
group of mathematical prob-
lems that have never been 
solved — and as a new and 
excited graduate student, the 
idea of taking one on. A huge 
fan of Jeopardy!, Maiberg was 
excited to work with his ad-
viser, who had helped build 
IBM’s Watson and was a “van-
guard of the robot uprising,” 
but sad to leave his girlfriend. 
As school moved forward, his 
relationship slowly deterio-
rated. Eventually, via Google 
Hangout, Maiberg’s girlfriend 
broke it off.
His living situation didn’t 
help. Finding an apartment 
through Craiglist, Maiberg’s 
roommates included “a 
17-year-old girl, a Pitt student, 
and two men who told us they 
were uncle and nephew that 
insisted on living in the attic.” 
One day, police broke in to 
their home “NYPD style,” look-
ing for the nephew-uncle duo. 
Amid a broken relationship, a 
police break-in, and impend-
ing ?nals, an impromptu trip 
to see a friend in Cambridge, 
Mass. helped clear his mind.
“I felt like I had some sort 
of crazed epiphany,” he said. 
Thinking back on the impos-
sible millennium problems, 
Maiberg stated, “We are deter-
ministic machines ourselves.” 
By being pushed to the brink, 
Maiberg realized there “were 
not shortcuts” in life. He re-
turned to Carnegie Mellon, 
performed well on his ?nals, 
and moved on with a new per-
spective.
Craig Lehocky
Craig Lehocky is a can-
didate in the joint Carnegie 
Mellon and University of Pitts-
burgh M.D./Ph.D. program. 
Lehocky’s father worked con-
struction, and growing up in 
the Pittsburgh area, Lehocky 
spent summers removing as-
bestos and septic tanks. Even-
tually, he learned to “get the 
hell out [of construction] and 
go into science.”
One day while presenting 
data to his research group, 
Lehocky noticed “people gig-
gling and smirking during his 
presentation.” He was later  
asked by a colleague, “Do you 
always speak like that?” It was 
then that Lehocky began to real-
ize that he “didn’t sound like the 
people he admired.” After that, 
he became self-conscious about 
his native Pittsburgh accent.
Lehocky planned to take 
a year off before continuing 
his education and applied to 
a fellowship at the University 
of Cambridge. Senior year, he 
decided to travel down south 
with a friend over Thanksgiv-
ing. On Thanksgiving morning 
— hung over from the previ-
ous night — he received a call 
from an unknown number. On 
the other end was “the most 
beautiful and eloquent Eng-
lish accent” he had ever heard. 
He then realized, “This is my 
professor, this is my interview, 
and the British do not observe 
Thanksgiving.”
In a state between being 
still drunk and not yet hun-
gover, he had a two-hour con-
versation with his potential 
adviser. Lehocky had concerns 
about the call: “On the one 
hand, we had an extensive 
conversation for two hours. 
On the other hand, I sounded 
like a complete jagoff.” He was 
accepted to Cambridge, boost-
ing his con?dence in himself, 
idiosyncrasies and all, but 
ended up not attending. He 
never did leave Pittsburgh (or 
the Pittsburgh accent, for that 
matter).
Michelle Ntampaka
The last story of the eve-
ning was told by Michelle 
Ntampaka, a Ph.D. student 
in the physics department. 
Ntampaka spoke about her 
tales in Rwanda, astrophys-
ics, and (re)discovering the 
two loves of her life. Her story 
began in rural Pennsylvania, 
where Ntampaka remembers 
a feeling of enchantment look-
ing into the dark sky.
After graduating college, 
Ntampaka held a bachelor’s 
degree in physics and a sense 
of restlessness. She traveled 
abroad to work as a volunteer 
with her church. The expedi-
tion was led by her minister, 
known as Pastor Bruce, who 
had three rules: one, follow 
his leadership; two, don’t com-
plain; and three, don’t get ro-
mantically involved.
The ?rst two rules were no-
brainers, and “the only person 
with a Y chromosome was Pas-
tor Bruce,” so she didn’t think 
it would be a problem.
According to Ntampaka, 
upon landing in Rwanda she 
had been through two straight 
red-eye ?ights “and smelled 
like it.” But she suddenly 
stopped dead in her tracks at 
the Rwandan airport. “I saw 
the most handsome man I had 
ever seen,” she said. “From the 
neck up, he was National Geo-
graphic. From the neck down, 
he was Wall Street.” His name 
was Burton, he was the group’s 
guide, and Ntampaka had a 
feeling she was going to break 
one of Pastor Bruce’s rules.
During the trip, she and 
Burton spent time together, 
but Ntampaka remained obe-
dient to Pastor Bruce’s no-
relationship rule. Once the 
expedition was over, however, 
Ntampaka began regularly 
communicating with Burton 
on Skype, and even traveled to 
Rwanda twice.
During one conversation, 
Burton ?nally said, “Michelle, 
I think you need to marry me.” 
She agreed.
“I crammed my wedding 
dress into a Tupperware con-
tainer, wrapped it in duct tape, 
and used it as my personal 
item for my last transatlantic 
?ight as a single woman,” she 
told the audience. The duo 
married and moved back to 
America, both starting new 
chapters in their lives.

Temperatures reach new high in eastern Arctic
Gifford Miller, a geological 
sciences professor at the Uni-
versity of Colorado Boulder, 
and his team have determined 
that average temperatures 
over the last century in the 
Eastern Canadian Arctic are 
higher than they have been 
any century in at least the past 
44,000 years.
Miller and his team looked 
at dead moss samples from 
receding ice caps on Baf?n 
Island. Radiocarbon dating 
determined that the mosses 
have been covered by ice for 
at least 44,000–51,000 years. 
Radiocarbon dating is only 
precise up to about 50,000 
years, so it is possible that the 
moss had not been exposed to 
the elements since before the 
last glaciation stage, which 
was approximately 120,000 
years ago.
Miller’s team predicts that 
all of the ice caps on Baf?n Is-
land will eventually melt.

Carnivorous mouse aids research on pain signals
Researchers at Sam Hous-
ton State University in Hunts-
ville, Texas have discovered 
that the southern grasshop-
per mouse, the only carnivo-
rous mouse in North America, 
could help in the production 
of painkillers due to muta-
tions that make the mouse 
resistant to pain.
Arizona bark scorpions 
are among the most poison-
ous scorpions in the world, 
but grasshopper mice are 
impervious to their poison. 
Normally, scorpion venom 
interacts with the Nav1.7 pro-
tein. Grasshopper mice, how-
ever, have mutated genes that 
encode a different protein, 
called Nav1.8, that blocks 
pain signals from reaching the 
brain. Researchers are look-
ing into the special Nav1.8 
protein in order to determine 
if it could help develop hu-
man painkillers.

New focus on improving deep brain stimulation
The Federal Defense Ad-
vanced Research Projects 
Agency has declared that over 
the next ?ve years they intend 
to invest over $70 million in 
brain implants to improve ex-
isting technology and create 
new technology.
The new program — called 
Systems-Based Neurotechnol-
ogy and Understanding for 
the Treatment of Neuropsy-
chological Illnesses — is part 
of the Obama administra-
tion’s BRAIN Initiative. Cur-
rent deep-brain stimulation 
can treat disorders, but can-
not track its own effective-
ness. Researchers involved 
with the program hope to de-
velop deep-brain devices able 
to monitor symptoms them-
selves and treat situations ap-
propriately.

After ?ooding the pro?le pictures 
of Pittsburgh’s Facebook users, the 
famed 40-foot rubber duck de?ated 
on Oct. 20. 
It was put in storage in South Side 
without much ceremony and with 
no concrete plans for future appear-
ances. But in the three weeks that it 
made Pittsburgh its nest, the Rubber 
Duck Project was exactly what the 
city needed: a unifying object for 
people to rally around. The city can 
only bene?t from creating more city-
wide events and spectacles.
The duck’s popularity far exceed-
ed the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s 
expectations. When applying for a 
permit to dock the duck, the Cul-
tural Trust estimated about 200 visi-
tors per day. More than one million 
people ended up making the trek to 
check out the duck, according to esti-
mates by local hotels and Point State 
Park. While about 95 percent were 
Pittsburgh-area residents, some 
came from all across the country, 
and even as far away as Canada.
The people of Pittsburgh need 
their sense of community to be rein-
forced periodically. Sure, there are 
the Steelers, colleges, the symphony, 
and other things that give Pittsburgh 
an identity, but many people settle in 
a city for good because of the specta-
cles, events, and culture that scream 
their names across the United States. 
Bigger cities like Chicago and Austin 
have larger land masses and expans-
es of city life, so their draws are built 
into their structure — but Pittsburgh 
can go from skyscraper to scrubland 
quickly. It needs spectacles to draw 
in a newer population.
Despite people leaving after the 
collapse of the steel industry, Pitts-
burgh is still the 20th-largest city in 
America, according to the U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau, and has been named 
“Most Livable City” by multiple pub-
lications. Still, many people see the 
city as the steel town it once was. 
Events and spectacles like the duck 
are helping to reinvent this image.
It’s a good thing the duck didn’t 
stick around much longer, though. 
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust quit 
while it was ahead, despite the pub-
lic’s calls to prolong the duck’s stay in 
Pittsburgh. If it had stayed more than 
a month, the duck would have gone 
from phenomenon to installation; 
having lost its initial appeal, it would 
have become boring and tired. 
Now that the duck is gone, 
though, the city should start brain-
storming its next big attraction.
Spectacles like Rubber Duck reinvigorate city energy
High school students must be taught basic ?nances
Students should not sacri?ce sleep for their grades
America’s youth is ?nancially il-
literate.
An April 2013 study conducted by 
EverFi, Inc., a technology company 
focused on educating children, re-
vealed that more than 25 percent of 
13–18-year-old high school students 
may not have the skills to manage 
basic personal ?nances upon gradu-
ation.
Unfortunately, many students 
graduate high school without know-
ing how to ?le their taxes, balance 
a check book, or properly manage a 
credit card.
According to the study, students 
believed that a good credit score 
was over 500, and one-third of re-
spondents answered that a good 
credit score was 300 or less. More 
shockingly, 41 percent of students 
believed that they are either entitled 
to receive their paid taxes back after 
?ling federal income tax returns, or 
that they simply do not need to pay 
income taxes at all.
It is critical that American high 
school students receive instruction 
on basic personal ?nances, espe-
cially in a dif?cult economic climate, 
and following a recession caused in 
part by people accepting loans they 
could not afford or understand. High 
schools should implement a basic 
personal ?nances course, which 
would teach these skills to high 
school students.
There appears to be demand 
from students to receive this kind of 
instruction. According to the same 
EverFi, Inc. study, 83 percent of sur-
veyed students believed that person-
al ?nance causes should be manda-
tory in schools.
A recent article published by PBS 
NewsHour suggests that teaching 
?nancial values to young children 
may be effective in combating the 
problem of ?nancially illiterate stu-
dents, detailing how parents should 
have their children earn and manage 
allowances. Additionally, children’s 
television programs such as Sesame 
Street are beginning to incorporate 
the value of saving and properly 
managing money into its education-
al content. Instilling these ?nancial 
values at a young age forms critical 
building blocks for high school ?nan-
cial programs and other efforts to be 
successful. It is never too early to 
learn the value of ?nancial respon-
sibility.
Through Carnegie Mellon’s chap-
ter of MoneyThink, a national orga-
nization devoted to teaching youth 
?nancial skills, university students 
are engaging high school students to 
educate them. The chapter mentors 
high schools students in an attempt 
to restore economic health in the 
community. The Carnegie Mellon 
MoneyThink chapter’s initiatives are 
an admirable ?rst step to the goal of 
educating high school students to be 
?nancially literate.
All high school students must 
graduate with basic ?nancial skills. 
High schools, as well as other com-
munity organizations, should make 
strides to ensure that students grad-
uate with at least the ability to bal-
ance a personal checkbook and ?le 
taxes.
As startling as it may seem to 
Carnegie Mellon students, recent re-
search proves that sleep is good.
Researchers at the University of 
Rochester discovered that, when a 
mammal sleeps, the process that the 
brain uses to remove accumulated 
natural toxic byproducts kicks into 
overdrive. Some toxins ?ushed from 
the system are responsible for plaque 
buildup found in the brains of people 
af?icted with Alzheimer’s disease.
The ?nding shows that the build-
up of these byproducts causes most of 
the negative effects of lack of sleep. 
Grogginess, irritability, and trouble 
forming and accessing memories can 
be traced to this cleansing process. 
Even though the study reveals some 
of the causes of sleep deprivation’s 
symptoms, a so-called cure — a pill 
or other necessary medication — is 
unlikely to develop in the near future 
since, during sleep, the neurons con-
tract to facilitate cleaning. Medica-
tion would have to cause or mimic 
this function.
This new information helps un-
derscore what we already know: 
Sleep is one of the most important 
parts of being a healthy individual. 
Pulling all-nighters may have rami?-
cations for not only the next day, but 
for years to come. While the study 
also indicated that excessive sleep is 
not good, the dangers of sleep depri-
vation are even more pronounced.
At Carnegie Mellon, students are 
not strangers to the phrase “sleep is 
for the weak,” especially as they push 
themselves to study harder and lon-
ger or squeeze in extra time for rec-
reational activity. Unfortunately, this 
mindset often puts students’ grades 
before their health. Students ignore 
the fact that deteriorating health 
might lead to poor grades or worse.
If the ill effects of a lack of sleep 
don’t motivate students to get at least 
eight hours each night, the research 
also indicates that sleep helps people 
study. During sleep, the brain cata-
logs memories and makes sure that 
the most important ones are accessi-
ble. A good night’s sleep can be more 
effective than a night of cramming, 
and it’s certainly more appealing.
Marriage equality in N.J. deserves attention
Ariel Hoffmaier
Junior Staffwriter
New Jersey became the 14th state 
to recognize same-sex marriage 
on Oct. 21. Hundreds of couples, 
many of whom had been commit-
ted to each other for years, lined the 
streets outside of Newark’s city hall 
in the early hours of the day, eager 
to ?nally be granted equal bene?ts 
under both state and federal law. For 
these couples, certainly, it was a day 
of joy a long time coming.
Strangely, though, this latest vic-
tory has been met with compara-
tively little celebration by the larger 
community. Past legalizations have 
warranted parties and parades, not 
to mention a storm of coverage by 
the media. So why is the Garden 
State any different?
It cannot be said that New Jer-
sey is an insigni?cant state, since its 
population is sizable — it is the third 
largest state to legalize same-sex 
marriage after New York and Cali-
fornia. Also, the state has a strong 
conservative minority and even a 
popular Republican governor Chris 
Christie (R-N.J.), who is poised to 
lead the red ticket in 2016. Christie’s 
stubborn opposition to same-sex 
marriage, his attempts to appeal the 
state court decision to legalize same-
sex marriage, and his eventual with-
drawal of that appeal were packed 
with potential for news coverage. 
However, besides the predictable 
conservative dissent, this con?ict 
has passed with minimal notice.
Even less recognized — and 
more important — is the fact that 
New Jersey is the ?rst state to be 
pushed off the fence by the over-
turning of the Defense of Marriage 
Act (DOMA) earlier this year. Since 
2006, New Jersey has offered civil 
unions — rather than marriage — to 
same-sex couples. The explanation 
for this choice has been that under 
New Jersey state law, civil unions 
and heterosexual marriages were 
virtually identical; as such, no one 
could claim that New Jersey was 
denying equal bene?ts to same-sex 
couples. 
However, DOMA’s repeal invali-
dated this excuse. Several govern-
ment agencies began to extend 
federal bene?ts to legally married 
same-sex couples, and consequent-
ly New Jersey marriages and civil 
unions were no longer equivalent. 
The court decision in New Jersey 
grew out of a promise to ensure all 
citizens equal protection by law.
The legalization of same-sex 
marriage in New Jersey should have 
been a signi?cant milestone, and 
not just because of the powerful 
in?uence that the repeal of DOMA 
had over it. New Jersey serves as an 
example that — beyond religion, 
politics, and prejudice — the battle 
for marriage equality should be de-
?ned by equal treatment under the 
law. Indeed, the war must be about 
equal treatment if we can ever hope 
to erode the iron chains guarding 
the same-sex marriage bans in some 
of America’s most stubbornly con-
servative states.
Then why is it that — even more 
than a week after New Jersey legal-
ized same-sex marriage — equality 
within the state has received rela-
tively little national attention?
The anomaly can be interpreted 
in two ways. First, the lack of sensa-
tion could be a sign that same-sex 
marriage is no longer a cause for sen-
sation. Perhaps marriage equality is 
now becoming the new normal, and 
for the majority of Americans in sup-
port of it, New Jersey is just another 
state to check off on a domino chain 
that is bound to continue accelerat-
ing nationwide. There is undeniable 
optimism in this view. If Christie was 
able to somehow recognize that he 
was on the wrong side of history, 
might not other politicians start to 
realize the same?
It is the greatest hope of support-
ers everywhere that one day same-
sex marriage — and LGBTQ equal-
ity in general — will be no cause for 
controversy. However, that day has 
not yet arrived. 
A second, more realistic inter-
pretation of the anomaly says that 
normality is dangerous if it leads to 
dormancy in the movement. This 
interpretation promises that it is 
more important now than ever to 
celebrate each victory at least as 
enthusiastically as the one before 
— keep a lookout for New Mexico 
and Hawaii in upcoming months. By 
moving forward without fail in an 
always growing wave of ardent sup-
port, we will eventually move oppo-
sition to the side of change.

Healthcare site needed delayed launch
BRADEN KELNER
Since its launch on Oct. 1, 
the Affordable Care Act website, 
healthcare.gov, has been plagued 
with privacy and functionality is-
sues. Users have found it frustrating 
or impossible to log in. Ben Simo, 
former president of the Association 
for Software Testing, found that the 
website sometimes sends sensitive 
information without encryption, 
and its email veri?cation system can 
be bypassed, he said in an interview 
with TIME magazine. The contrac-
tors hired to build the website testi-
?ed to the House Energy and Com-
merce Committee on Thursday that 
the Federal government did not give 
them enough time to test the site.
It is important for citizens to have 
ample time to sign up for health in-
surance; under the Affordable Care 
Act, American citizens are required 
to be insured by the start of 2014. 
However, the Federal government 
should have allotted extra time and 
put forth more effort to work out 
these issues, even if it meant delay-
ing the website’s launch.
According to a Gallup poll con-
ducted Oct. 18–20, 50 percent of the 
general public disapproves of the Af-
fordable Care Act while 45 percent 
approves of it. Meanwhile, a stagger-
ing 86 percent of Republicans dis-
approve of the act. With a relatively 
large amount of money being poured 
into the website from taxpayers, 
many of whom may not support the 
Affordable Care Act, the government 
should have been cautious not to roll 
out the website too quickly.
The United States Government 
Accountability Of?ce estimates 
that the Federal government spent 
$394 million to set up the website 
and establish tools through which 
people can complete health insur-
ance exchanges prior to the website’s 
launch. That’s a generous budget to 
create a website, especially for a law 
largely opposed by public opinion.
With such a large budget, those 
responsible for the website’s launch 
have no excuse for its poor debut. 
The agencies contracted to the web-
site were chosen to develop a con-
venient tool for U.S. citizens to use 
to purchase insurance at affordable 
rates. The Affordable Care Act is 
meant to be a groundbreaking move 
by the government, and the website 
is a key component, but the website 
is anything but groundbreaking.
Surely those in charge of the web-
site knew that staunch Republicans 
and other critics would jump at the 
opportunity to discredit the Afford-
able Care Act given the chance. After 
all, they have opposed it vehemently 
since it was signed into law by Presi-
dent Barack Obama in 2010. With 
this knowledge, those charged with 
creating the website should have 
made it a high priority in the overall 
implementation of the act. Instead, 
they placed it on the back burner to 
be tested and supported inadequate-
ly. Rather than hire a technology 
company to oversee the project, they 
allowed the Center for Medicare and 
Medicaid services to act as the sys-
tem integrator for the website.
Now Jeffrey Zients, a White 
House of?cial working on the web-
site, claims that services will run 
smoothly for most Americans by the 
end of November. This lengthy re-
pair time is a clear indication of the 
extent of the website’s launch ?aws. 
Of course, the Obama administra-
tion would have still received back-
lash from skeptics if it delayed the 
launch of the website, but a delay 
may have been the administration’s 
best move. An administration that 
announces its reasons for delays is 
better than an administration that 
launches ?awed products.

Apple’s new method:
Revolution by evolution
JUSTIN YAN
In Steven Spielberg’s Minority Re-
port, technology in the year 2054 is 
everywhere. Every inch of glass is an 
LCD screen, watches have been re-
placed with sensors, and screens can 
be maneuvered by a ?ick of the wrist. 
In the movie, not only is technology 
on the body, but technology is a large 
part of a person’s self-de?nition.
Although society has not reached 
this level of technological sophistica-
tion, we have breached the bubble of 
wearable technology. Google Glass, 
the Samsung Galaxy Gear smart-
watch, and the Pebble smartwatch 
are the most prominent gadgets 
that belong to the ?rst generation of 
wearable technologies.
There are numerous perks that 
come with the integration of new 
technologies in our daily lives and 
movements. Cloud computing op-
erator Rackspace found in a recent 
study that 82 percent of the Ameri-
cans who have tried wearable tech-
nologies believe that the technolo-
gies would enhance their lives. There 
is one big downside: the many priva-
cy issues that spring out of the wide-
spread use of wearable technology.
A person could cyberstalk some-
one across a café by looking up peo-
ple who have checked into Starbucks 
recently. Facebook could then take a 
note that the stalker is looking at that 
person. Google could know what the 
stalker is looking at and where the 
stalker is going because the stalker is 
wearing Google Glass; yet the person 
across the café would not see a thing. 
Rackspace reports that 53 percent of 
Americans who don’t wear technol-
ogy feel that wearable devices raise 
some sort of privacy issue. Only 8 
percent said wearing Google Glass 
would be okay in any situation. The 
scary thing is, we can’t see anything 
that occurs on the other side of the 
computer chip. It’s easy to see if that 
person across the café took a picture, 
but it’s not so simple to see where 
that information is going. Google 
could be taking all of the data stored 
within a phone or web browser. And 
this blindness with which people 
have been using technology isn’t re-
cent. Certainly, iPhones and Google 
Glass were not the initial steps into 
the unknown, where the data of con-
sumers could be logged and catego-
rized for various uses by technology 
?rms. The everyday consumer has 
been blind for a long time.
Blindness hasn’t exactly hurt con-
sumers, but it has helped some tech-
nology giants ?ll buckets of revenue 
through the study of information.
How do they use information to 
increase revenue? Google presents 
a prime example. Steven Levy of 
Wired Magazine wrote an article on 
Google’s system of advertisements, 
using the term “Googlenomics.” This 
term refers to Google’s algorithms 
that auction off advertisements for 
individual users based on previous 
searches. The advertisements be-
come customized for users, which is 
useful for Google and users. Google 
gets a ton of money from advertisers 
while users get more relevant ads. 
Levy writes, “Selling ads doesn’t just 
generate pro?ts, it also generates 
torrents of data about users’ tastes 
and habits, data that Google then 
sifts and processes in order to predict 
future consumer behavior ... and sell 
more ads.” The more traf?c Google 
receives, the more data it analyzes 
and the more advertisements it dis-
plays. In a way, Google dehumanizes 
people by monetizing them.
More than ever, data is up for 
grabs for technology companies. Af-
ter the rise of Googlenomics in 2002, 
Facebook became a huge social net-
work that now connects billions of 
people. Facebook doesn’t really need 
an algorithm to sort through user in-
formation because the information 
is already available on each person’s 
pro?le. Facebook could do so much 
more than Google, and with the rise 
of wearable technology, Facebook 
could develop programs that literally 
shadow people in their daily lives.
Google’s rather aged brand of 
revenue generation then points to-
ward a concept that has gathered 
public attention relatively recently: 
big data, or data amounts so large 
that they cannot be processed sim-
ply. This is where the new concept of 
wearable technologies blends with 
the old concept of Googlenomics. Big 
data is made possible by the sheer 
volume of people using the Internet 
and the relative cheapness of hard-
ware and software where people can 
store data. A recent article in Foreign 
Affairs magazine points to uses of 
big data, such as reducing the need 
for random sampling in statistics — 
sample sizes effectively become ev-
eryone who is plugged into a device.
Big data is the child of technologi-
cal advances, the rise of social net-
working, and general Internet use.
Where does that leave us? For 
starters, the general idea of privacy 
has changed. We no longer live in a 
world where we can’t be part of the 
system. We can’t see who’s looking 
at our information because it’s not 
con?ned to our own devices. That 
information is in the cloud or other 
storage services; it is somewhere else 
   — probably on one of Google’s many 
servers. It is up to us, the users and 
the used, whether the advantages 
of using wearable technology and 
big data outweigh the baggage that 
comes along.

Wearable devices raise privacy issues 
BRANDON SCHMUCK
Shareholders and critics alike 
have claimed that Apple has lost its 
innovative spirit since the death of 
Steve Jobs. However, based on this 
month’s product keynote — where 
many products, most notably the 
iPad Air, were revealed — these 
claims are anything but true. While 
Apple has failed to release a new 
product category since the iPad in 
2010, it has done an excellent job 
at improving both the feel and user 
experience of its current products 
— the things that matter most to the 
user.
Apple’s keynote opened with a 
short clip, featuring a question that 
Apple adheres to closely as it devel-
ops products: “What do we want 
people to feel?” The clip continued 
with the statement “design requires 
focus” on core emotions, such as 
“delight, surprise, love, [and] con-
nection.” Throughout the keynote, 
Apple speakers like CEO Tim Cook 
made it clear that the statement 
made during the clip embodied all 
that the company represents.
Those who prematurely predict 
the death of Apple are quick to point 
out that Apple has failed to revolu-
tionize any category of consumer 
products lately. While the com-
pany has remained centralized on 
its main product line and has not 
strayed into uncharted device ter-
ritories, critics cry that they want 
iWatches, iTelevisions, or anything 
that can somehow change their 
iLives.
Despite it’s lack of recent innova-
tion, Apple has taken part in a dif-
ferent method of change — revolu-
tion through evolution. Apple does 
this by taking an existing product, 
such as the iPad, and evolving it un-
til it approaches the limit of perfec-
tion. The engineers and designers at 
Apple have been successful because 
they strive for perfection. They are 
not happy until they place a device 
as thin as a razor, yet as powerful as 
a full-scale desktop, into the hands 
of everyday people. The result of 
this discipline is the iPad Air.
While the iPad Air will not revo-
lutionize or create an entirely new 
industry like the original iPad, Ap-
ple continues to embrace the vision 
of perfection that Jobs and the team 
sought when they released the ?rst 
iPad. 
By any means, Apple did not in-
corporate new technology that is 
out of this world into the iPad Air, 
but it put technology together in a 
way that has a similar effect.
Apple stressed that the iPad Air is 
not given justice when people watch 
its informational videos, and that to 
get the complete experience, people 
must have it in their hands.
While the original iPad Mini did 
not have parts that broke industry 
standards, it had a different feel 
than any other handheld device. 
It felt as light as a feather, yet was 
more powerful than tablets many 
times its size — I expect the iPad Air 
experience to be similar.
Apple has succeeded where so 
many tech companies have failed: 
connecting with users. 
Apple spent more time at its 
conference showing how the iPad 
has changed people’s lives through 
simplicity rather than describing ev-
ery detail of its A7 processor. By all 
means, the A7 processor is a great 
feat of technology, but nonetheless, 
the user does not care. Users only 
care that the device ?ows from ap-
plication to application, providing 
a simple, seamless, and powerful 
experience.
Because Apple is increasing its 
aptitude of connecting with custom-
ers, the claims that the company has 
lost its innovative spirit are simply 
ludicrous. 
Apple has created a line of prod-
ucts with feeling — something that 
few other technology companies 
have the ability to do.

After a rough 0–4 start, the 
Pittsburgh Steelers sent the 
city into a state of panic. The 
Steelers were written off and 
previously unimaginable con-
versations were being held at 
dinner tables and bars. 
Fans thought of trading 
Super Bowl winning quarter-
back Ben Roethlisberger and 
starting over with a rookie 
from next year’s quarterback-
heavy draft. 
But ever so quietly, the 
Steelers have strung together 
two straight wins, including 
one over their division rivals, 
the Baltimore Ravens. Head-
ing into Week 8, the Steelers 
sit only 2.5 games out of the 
wild card and three games out 
of the division. It is entirely 
possible for Pittsburgh to re-
cover from its terrible start 
and sneak into the playoffs.
The turnaround can be at-
tributed to a few major chang-
es. First, head coach Mike 
Tomlin started to lay down 
the law by banning all games 
such as pool and table tennis 
in the locker room in hopes 
of improving player focus. It 
started as a ban on just play-
ers with less than four years 
of experience, but after two 
games under that restriction, 
the team felt the forced di-
vide within the team was un-
necessary, and the ban was 
extended team wide.
The start of the Steelers 
winning streak can also be 
connected to the return of 
rookie running back Le’Veon 
Bell from a Lisfranc sprain. His 
return in Week 4 helped bol-
ster a piecemeal running back 
core that had been ravaged by 
injury. Veteran running backs 
Isaac Redman, Felix Jones, 
and Jonathan Dwyer tried to 
carry the load after Pittsburgh 
let former workhorse, run-
ning back Rashard Menden-
hall, leave in free agency. Red-
man has since been released, 
with Dwyer reduced to back-
ing up Bell and Jones making 
his main contributions on spe-
cial teams.
The Steelers turnaround 
can become one of the great 
stories of the NFL, but not all 
Pittsburghers actually want 
to see their team do well this 
year. There have been con-
cerns for the past two years 
that the Steelers are too old 
and have too much cap space 
tied up in aging veterans. By 
winning just enough games 
to make a run at the playoffs, 
the Steelers could place them-
selves with another mid-?rst 
round draft pick, where pros-
pects have lower ceilings.
With a high draft pick, the 
Steelers could get an immedi-
ate starter on defense.  Defen-
sive end Jadeveon Clowney 
and linebacker Anthony Barr 
both project to be top ?ve 
talents. Pittsburgh could also 
choose to continue their focus 
on their offensive line with 
three tackles projected to be 
top 10 picks: Jake Matthews, 
Taylor Lewan, and Cyrus 
Kouandjio.
Either way, the Steelers 
are showing signs of life and 
hope for the future with Bell 
as their lead running back. 
Whether the team wins now 
or later just dictates how 
many more chances Roethlis-
berger and Tomlin get at an-
other Super Bowl together.
SPORTS COMMENTARYSteelers hope to change course

Last year, the MLB intro-
duced a second wild card team 
to try to keep more teams 
?ghting for postseason glory. 
This puts more teams on an 
equal playing ?eld by needing 
only some luck and skill to go 
from a losing season to wild 
card success. Baseball tradi-
tionalists were up in arms over 
the idea that the ?fth-best 
team in either league could 
end in the World Series.
This year’s World Series 
between the Boston Red Sox 
and St. Louis Cardinals, how-
ever, has been the opposite 
of what the MLB had in mind 
when adding the wild card 
spot and has eased the fears 
of traditionalists around the 
country. Each team had the 
best record in their respec-
tive leagues. These two teams 
have also been two of the most 
consistent in baseball over the 
past decade.
Since 2004, when these 
two teams last met in the 
World Series that ended Bos-
ton’s 86-year championship 
drought, the Red Sox have 
won championships in 2007, 
and the Cardinals won in both 
2006 and 2011.
The stories of how these 
two teams made it to the 
World Series are remarkably 
similar. Both feature strong 
pitching, timely hitting, and 
uneven defense. 
The make-up of the pitch-
ing staffs is the largest differ-
ence between the two teams. 
The Cardinals have been rely-
ing on their fantastic staff of 
hard-throwing rookies, most 
of whom started the season 
in the minors or the bullpen. 
Rookie pitchers Michael Wa-
cha and Joe Kelly have been 
amazing in the postseason, 
dealing with increased pres-
sure using the same calm com-
posure of veteran ace Adam 
Wainwright.
On the other hand, the 
Red Sox staff is composed of 
resurging veterans, the most 
surprising of which is for-
mer ace pitcher John Lackey. 
After missing the 2012 sea-
son because of ulnar collat-
eral ligament reconstruction, 
Lackey ?nished the regular 
season with a 3.52 ERA and 
161 strikeouts, his highest to-
tal since his 2007 season with 
the Los Angeles Angels. Before 
his injury, Lackey had severely 
underperformed during his 
tenure with the Red Sox after 
signing a lucrative contract 
following his eight-year stint 
with the Angels.
For both teams, shortstop 
has been the weakest position. 
In Game 1, St. Louis in?elder 
Pete Kozma had two critical 
errors that helped fuel an early 
Red Sox rally that quickly put 
the game out of reach before 
the third inning. He redeemed 
himself in Game 2 with a great 
double play when he entered 
as part of a double switch.
Red Sox shortstop Stephen 
Drew has been solid defen-
sively but has struggled on 
offense. His one hit during 
the World Series came on an 
in?eld pop-up that landed 
squarely between the pitcher 
and catcher. Otherwise, he 
has been completely ineffec-
tive at the plate, bringing any 
momentum the Red Sox have 
to a complete stop.
Overall, these two teams 
are very evenly matched. But 
so far, the Cardinals have been 
the sharper team, bouncing 
back from a rough Game 1 and 
capitalizing on some Red Sox 
mental blunders and defen-
sive mistakes to lead the series 
2–1 after Saturday’s Game 3. 
Boston won’t go down without 
a ?ght, but ultimately, the Car-
dinals will take the series in 
seven games.
Tight matchup makes this year’s World Series dif?cult to predict

With the University Ath-
letic Association (UAA) Cham-
pionships coming up on Nov. 
8, the Wid Guisler Invitational 
presented a barometer check 
for the women’s volleyball 
team. 
At the weekend tourna-
ment held at Juniata College, 
the Tartans won two of their 
three games.
Last Friday, they defeated 
DeSales University 3–1 and 
won Saturday’s 1 p.m. game 
against Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity 3–2. Their one loss over 
the weekend came when they 
played host school Juniata 
College, ranked No. 11 in the 
nation.
“I think they were de?nitely 
beatable, if we had played our 
best,” said ?rst-year middle 
blocker Jackie Gibbons.
Gibbons said that the team 
made too many errors, while 
Juniata played a much cleaner 
game. “They’re a very good 
team, so it was still a good 
chance to play them,” she 
added.
The Tartans dropped the 
?rst two sets 19–25 and 15–25, 
before rebounding to take the 
third set 25–23. They were un-
able to carry their momentum 
into the fourth set, however, 
losing the decisive set 15–25.
Junior right-side hitter Ali 
Celentano and senior out-
side hitter Senna Parsa led 
the Tartan attack with 11 and 
10 kills, respectively, against 
Juniata. Senior defensive spe-
cialist and libero Ali Nichols 
led the team with 14 digs. 
Celentano also celebrated her 
1,000th career kill over the 
weekend.
“It’s really exciting because 
she’s only a junior and she’ll 
have next year too,” Gibbons 
said. “She’s really smart about 
her hits. She sees an opportu-
nity and she goes everywhere 
on the court.” 
The Tartans hope that 
Celentano’s success will con-
tinue through important 
games, including the UAA 
Championships.
Over the next two weeks, 
the Tartans will focus on im-
proving the ?ner details of 
their game.
“We need to improve our 
passing a little bit,” Gibbons 
said. “We need to work on 
keeping a faster game because 
when we play at a faster pace, 
that’s when we do our best.”
Johns Hopkins (9–11) was 
successful in slowing down 
the pace and drew out the 
game to ?ve sets, though the 
Tartans could have put them 
away earlier.
They have a chance to 
show their improvements 
before the UAA Champion-
ships this Wednesday at 
home against Mount Aloysius 
College at 7 p.m.
After the weekend tour-
nament, the Tartans are now 
21–8 for the season. Nich-
ols and Celentano were also 
named to the all-tournament 
team.

Both the men’s and wom-
en’s swimming and diving 
teams opened their seasons 
with big wins against confer-
ence rival Case Western Re-
serve University.
“It was de?nitely the best 
?rst swim meet I’ve been in,” 
said junior Cole Um.
Of the 32 events held at 
home on Saturday, Carnegie 
Mellon ?nished ?rst in 22. 
The men’s team won 178–108, 
while the women’s team won 
by an even greater margin 
with a ?nal score of 191–101.
After ?nishing second in 
the University Athletic Asso-
ciation (UAA) Conference last 
year, the men’s side looks to be 
bolstered by several ?rst-years 
this season.
First-years Evan Li and Siv-
an Mehta teamed up with stal-
warts Um and masters student 
Eddie Sears to win the 200-
yard medley. Li also ?nished 
?rst in the 200-yard freestyle 
and 200-yard backstroke.
“Evan is really versatile. 
He can swim in a bunch of 
events,” Sears said. “That 
[versatility] was something 
we didn’t have the last couple 
of years.... To have a couple of 
guys you can put in anywhere 
really helps us out.”
Another ?rst-year, Brian 
Walsh, found success in the 
butter?y, beating sophomore 
teammate Alexander Dintino 
by just 0.06 seconds in the 
100-yard butter?y and ?nish-
ing second in the 200-yard 
butter?y.
Dintino found better for-
tune later, ?nishing ?rst in the 
100-yard backstroke. 
Sears and Um, the top per-
formers of the past two sea-
sons, started their seasons on 
strong notes. Sears ?nished 
?rst in the 50-yard freestyle, 
while Um ?nished second in 
both the 100-yard and 200-
yard breaststrokes.
On the women’s side, ?rst-
year Kimberly Klausing ?n-
ished ?rst in both the 1,000-
yard and 500-yard freestyle.
“In general, [the ?rst-
years] really stepped up and 
performed their best,” said se-
nior Soleil Phan.
First-year Lauren Zemering 
?nished ?rst in the 50-yard 
freestyle and participated in 
Carnegie Mellon’s winning 
200-yard medley relay team.
Carnegie Mellon’s top ?n-
isher in the 100-yard butter?y, 
Gillian Crews, also swam on 
the Tartans’ second place 200-
yard medley team.
Phan, a standout on the 
women’s swimming team for 
the past three years, started 
off her season strong, ?nishing 
second in the 200-yard butter-
?y and ?rst in the 100-yard 
freestyle.
“I know that we’ve had a 
couple of illnesses so far, but 
overall, the whole team seems 
to be setting their pain aside 
and really focusing on what 
we want to accomplish this 
season,” Phan said.
The women’s diving squad 
also impressed. First-year Bar-
clay Kaku ?nished ?rst in the 
1-meter diving board, totaling 
226.80 points, while junior 
Winona Li ?nished second 
with 210.08 points.
In the 3-meter dive, Li ?n-
ished ?rst with 240.90 points 
and Kaku second with 211.35 
points.
For the men’s diving, 
sophomore Yannos Michaili-
dis ?nished second in both the 
1-meter and 3-meter dive.
With the addition of several 
impressive ?rst-years, both the 
men’s and women’s swimming 
and diving teams look to make 
deep runs this season.
“Our culture of our team 
this year is amazing. We push 
each other every day, and 
that’s what makes us all get 
better,” Sears said.
Their next challenge 
comes this Saturday at home 
at 11 a.m. against Clarion 
University.

Frazier shares witty readings
The New Yorker columnist transports listeners to Siberia
When an evening with a writer begins with a short 
piece on the perils of campfire cooking and has the 
audience in stitches within minutes, it’s sure to be a 
good lecture.
Author, humorist, and traveler Ian Frazier came to 
the Carnegie Lecture Hall in Oakland on Monday 
as a part of the Ten Literary Evenings series. As the 
name suggests, the series — funded in part by the 
Heinz Foundation — brings 10 prominent writers to 
lecture on their works and their worlds.
Frazier, a contributor to The New Yorker, has penned 
several books in addition to many years’ worth of 
columns for the magazine. His most recent book is 
titled The Cursing Mommy’s Book of Days and gives 
an unorthodox look at modern motherhood.
Despite being “technically on tour” for the book, 
Frazier declined to read aloud from it for the 
audience, charmingly saying the profanity was 
“too uncomfortable to read aloud.” Instead, he 
read short excerpts from his essays, talked about 
his upbringing and travels, and lamented about 
parenthood.
Frazier grew up in Hudson, a small town in Ohio, 
where he says the eternal boredom of childhood in a 
tiny American suburb was the best way to grow up. 
He poetically described the small town as a center of 
centrifugal force, spinning kids around the nucleus 
until they gained enough inspiration to spin off and 
do something great with their lives. He also talked 
extensively about his amorous relationship with — of 
all places — Siberia and how that love resulted in a 
book called Travels in Siberia.
Frazier’s whimsical attitude and witty interjections 
provided the perfect occasion for his anecdotes 
about traveling in Russia. Calling Russia “the 
greatest horrible place in the world,” Frazier 
described the differences between its society and 
ours, told stories of the people he met, and painted 
beautiful scenic pictures for the audience.
He described his attachment to the country, saying, 
“Everyone belongs to one country, but there’s always 
another country that is yours. For me, it’s Russia.” 
Frazier will be returning to Siberia in a week — 
though he never expected to — to participate in a 
cultural conference.
Frazier wrapped up the evening by switching gears 
and focusing on parenthood, making a connection 
to the themes of The Cursing Mommy. He read 
a piece called “Laws Regarding Food and Drink; 
Household Principles: Lamentations of a Father,” a 
parody on the Book of Lamentations found in Jewish 
and Christian scripture. The piece described the 
rules of the dinner table and general standards of 
kid behavior, and its cheeky yet exhausted tone 
was recognizable to anyone who had ever yelled at 
children or been yelled at themselves.
Hilarious and entertaining, Frazier’s lecture made for 
an enjoyable evening. Though his stories had little 
rhyme or reason, the audience was no less engaged.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Matt & Ryan,
I’m an adjunct professor 
with an odd impulse to 
play matchmaker with 
two seniors. I’m pretty 
certain they don’t know 
each other — so we are 
talking a blind set-up.
Is this urge to meddle 
trouble? Is this about 
them or me? Have I 
watched too many John 
Hughes movies? I’d like to 
stay within the perimeters 
of my teaching role, but 
I also have a really good 
feeling about these two 
kids...
Yours Sincerely,
Senior-Helping Adviser, 
Decides Couple Hopeful, 
Arrangement Necessary
Dear SHADCHAN,
The number-one thing to 
remember when playing 
matchmaker is to not back 
down. Teachers have 
something like a sixth sense 
for this. Meddling can be 
tricky, but if you feel your 
relationship with both of 
these students is friendly 
enough that they won’t 
mind, and might even be 
excited at the opportunity, 
go for it. We’re in college, 
and teacher-student 
relationships tend to be 
less constricted than in high 
school. And this is Carnegie 
Mellon, after all; sometimes 
an extra push at the right 
time is helpful. Go for it, and 
hope they go for it too.
We don’t think we’ll be 
able to sleep if we don’t 
feel this little talk has 
helped you. So would you 
be a sport and lie to us?
Ryan & Matt
Dear Ryan & Matt,
My best friend, whom I 
am lucky enough to have 
as a roommate, recently 
broke his wrist. A couple 
kids made fun of him 
by giving him fruit and 
otherwise messing with 
him. Until recently, he 
had shrugged it off, but 
I woke up one morning 
and realized he wasn’t at 
home! I never bothered to 
ask for his phone number 
since we live together, 
and spend all day, every 
day, doing the same 
thing, but if you or any of 
your readers know where 
Franklin is, could you 
send him home?
Thanks,
Strongly a-Tizzy About 
This Uncertain Experience
Dear STATUE,
We here at Advice for 
Awkward People know the 
worry these circumstances 
can cause, but we can’t ?le 
a missing persons report 
until 72 hours after the 
individual has gone missing. 
It’s possible he just got tired 
of the living arrangement. 
Ask yourself if there was 
something in the roommate 
relationship that wasn’t 
working out. Did you want to 
be close to campus, when 
Franklin wanted to live closer 
to the nightlife? Was there 
a big life decision in either 
or both of your lives? Many 
college students aren’t ready 
for a marriage proposal.
Don’t fret,
Matt & Ryan

Bat Boy: The Musical can be summed up in one word: 
insane.
That’s not to say it isn’t a great musical. Scotch’n’Soda’s 
newest production is insane in all the right ways. It’s a 
show that combines death, twisted love, and existential 
suffering with a cheerful, dimple-on-the-cheek kind of 
humor. The dialogue is hilarious, the story dances in 
logical leaps, and the body count is high: Six characters 
and several animals are killed on stage by the end of the 
show.
Bat Boy is the story of the titular Bat Boy, a strange, 
deformed boy discovered in a West Virginian mine. 
Bat Boy is taken in by a veterinarian’s wife, christened 
“Edgar,” and taught to be a part of civilization. However, 
the town blames him for the deaths of several cows and 
hates him for his strageness and hideous appearance. 
Bat Boy longs for acceptance, but he has a dark secret he 
feels he cannot reconcile with the civilized world.
Though the premise for Bat Boy sounds absolutely 
ridiculous, Scotch’n’Soda does a fantastic job of giving 
it a sense of depth and realism. The student directors, 
senior psychology and decision science double major 
Corinne Rockoff and senior math major William Veer, left 
a note in the program: “In this production, we took the 
dark, heavy, and gory portions of the script and brought 
them to the forefront. What we hoped to achieve was a 
clearer and more poignant picture of the oppression and 
suppression of an outsider; accented, but not pervaded, 
by funny dialogue.”
The musical has a penchant for taking a darker turn at 
the ?ip of a switch. A perfectly happy musical number 
could be in mid-swing when a Gothic timbre suddenly 
rolls in: The lighting turns a deep red, and all goes to hell. 
The audience is kept in intense anticipation, especially 
in the latter part of the show when the plot takes 
unexpected turns.
The cast members of Bat Boy are highly enthusiastic in 
their roles and bring out much of the show’s humor and 
energy.
The lead performances were especially strong: 
Throughout the insane action of the story, they managed 
to ground their characters as real, sympathetic people. 
Senior decision science major John Oravec, who 
portrayed Bat Boy/Edgar, brings out the character’s 
desperate suffering. Undeclared senior CFA student 
James Alexander excels in his role as Dr. Parker — a 
pathetic, unloved man who ultimately turns to villainy. 
Also stellar is sophomore vocal performance major 
Sophia Emanuel as Dr. Parker’s wife, Meredith, who is 
very troubled as the only person trying to do the right 
thing in a cruel, unforgiving world.
As for the music, Bat Boy has a number of highly 
enjoyable songs. The musical makes distinctive use 
of electric guitar, which gives the show a darker edge. 
“Dance With Me Darling” is at ?rst a soft, romantic tango 
that becomes more sinister as the song progresses. 
“Show You a Thing or Two” is a clever little song that 
serves as a bright and cheery segue into the darker 
portions of the show. “A Joyful Noise,” a blast of gospel 
music, was one of the most energetic songs in the 
show and had the audience clapping to the rhythm. In 
“Children, Children,” the pagan god Pan shows up to 
deliver a rowdy serenade on love and sensuality.
However, the show shines brightest at its most macabre. 
In “Apology to a Cow,” Edgar, previously established as 
educated and well dressed, comes onto the scene with 
his chest and face smeared in blood, and eulogizes his 
lost humanity over a decapitated cow’s head. It is raw, 
uncompromising, and unforgettable.
After the Saturday night show, many audience members 
gave highly positive reviews of the production.
“I think the directors’ choices in casting were perfect, 
especially James and Sophia,” said senior chemical 
engineering major Deanna Bucci. Bucci also praised the 
excellent music direction of the production.
“The show was great. The special effects and blood were 
great. Bat Boy is very different from most musicals. I 
hadn’t known about the show before and haven’t seen 
anything like this ... but I really enjoyed it. I thought the 
performances for Bat Boy and Meredith were spot on,” 
remarked senior economics and statistics major Emily 
Wright.
“There was a lot of social commentary. The Bat Boy was 
really great himself, and the mother. The music direction 
was particularly fantastic,” said sophomore cognitive 
science major Sam Cheyette.
As for the message of Bat Boy, it focuses on the 
con?ict between man’s dual natures, human versus 
beast, and the dif?culty of being a social outsider. The 
remaining social commentary plays second ?ddle to the 
bizarre spectacle of the show. The ?rst few bars of the 
introduction say there is a lesson to be learned, but what 
lesson is that exactly? Society is cruel? Love blinds? 
Don’t raise cows on mountains?
The unclear message aside, Bat Boy is endlessly 
entertaining. It’s a ridiculous story mixed with gruesome 
tragedy, which makes a perfect combination for 
Halloween.

Short albums give musical food for thought
Best Coast steps outside the box, while Diplo produces uninspiring new release
When it comes to papers, English teachers like to say it’s 
not the length, but the content, that matters.
The same can be said of a music album. Most artists 
sweat it out in the studio to produce a full-length LP of 
at least 10 songs, but sometimes they call it a day at ?ve 
or six. While these shorter albums don’t often make the 
same splash as the longer ones, they hold together just 
as well. Here are two recent examples.
Best Coast — Fade Away
Released last Monday, the latest mini-album by ’50s 
and ’60s surf rock-inspired alternative duo Best Coast 
shows a band that has grown tremendously in the three 
years since its debut album, Crazy For You. That being 
said, Fade Away is also hindered by songwriter Bethany 
Cosentino’s tendency to fall back on old formulas and 
in?uences.
Fade Away contains Best Coast’s most sophisticated and 
ambitious songwriting yet. Instead of the usual simple 
songs about unrequited boy love and unconditional 
affection for California, Cosentino is writing and 
singing from a much deeper and more bitter place. 
While Cosentino has de?nitely matured as a writer, she 
occasionally tries to make her old tricks work harder than 
they can. Most of the songs are around four minutes 
long, but because of her simple, poppy themes, not all 
Cosentino’s songs can support the extended length. 
“Who Have I Become?” takes what could be a tight three 
minutes and extends it to nearly ?ve.
For Fade Away, Best Coast found the comfortable middle 
ground between the lo-?, fuzzy-pink feel of Crazy For 
You and the studio shine of the band’s second album, 
The Only Place. The production is atmospheric, opening 
up the songs and allowing them to breathe. This kind of 
studio trickery is best evidenced by “Baby I’m Crying,” 
whose vocals ?oat gently over soft acoustic and pedal-
steel guitars.
The album’s highlights occur at perfect blends of all the 
band’s previous work. The closer, “I Don’t Know How,” 
begins as a slow, sad waltz before exploding into what 
can only be described as Stevie Nicks singing for the 
Ramones. Meanwhile, “This Lonely Morning” sounds like 
the mature older sister of the title track on Crazy For You.
Fade Away may have its missteps, but these missteps 
prove that Best Coast is ?nally stepping outside its 
comfort zone. Besides, there’s no doubt that after a 
listen, the melodies will bounce around your head and 
slip out of your mouth all day long. If this album signi?es 
anything, it’s that we should all hotly anticipate what the 
band cooks up in the studio for next spring.
Diplo — Revolution
Superstar DJ and music producer Diplo is nothing if 
not a workaholic. This year alone he racked up a list of 
collaborations, remixes, and releases that would make 
the average performer feel like a couch potato. That 
being said, Diplo doesn’t match this quantity with 
consistent quality. His latest solo EP, Revolution, seems it 
was released just to be released. Diplo put little thought 
and effort into the album’s four songs; the last two are 
remixes of album tracks by outside producers TWRK and 
Boaz van de Beatz.
Right off the bat, it’s clear that Diplo’s recent fascination 
with booty hasn’t waned. Album opener “Biggie 
Bounce” picks up where last year’s “Express Yourself” 
and this year’s “Bubble Butt” left off, with Travis Porter 
stringing together words that rhyme without much 
attention paid to coherent thoughts. While Diplo’s work 
usually matches this standard in terms of substance, 
he makes up for it with dynamite production. “Express 
Yourself” is a song about twerking, but has enough 
twists and turns to make up for it. On that track, Diplo 
clearly put time and effort into crafting something that 
sounded new and interesting. This time around, it seems 
he’s perfectly content to put just enough into the song 
that it plays for three minutes and includes a command 
for all the ladies to bend over.
The big problem with the album is just how formulaic 
and forgettable much of it feels; the long list of 
collaborators seems to exist only to ?ll space. Mike 
Posner’s vocals on “Crown” seem to only bide time 
until the mediocre drop. “Rock Steady” features rappers 
Action Bronson, Mr. MFN eXquire, and RiFF RAFF, 
and is the album’s standout track for all the wrong 
reasons. Uninspired sirens and whistles blare over a 
beat that ferries its unskilled passengers over the song’s 
three-and-a-half minutes. Why Diplo ever decided to 
sign RiFF RAFF to his label, Mad Decent, is beyond all 
comprehension. He must owe someone money.
While Revolution probably won’t go down as Diplo’s 
highest creative peak, the man shouldn’t be written 
off. He is, after all, the mind behind the Clash-sampling 
“Paper Planes” by M.I.A, a nearly undisputed modern 
classic. Following the 2011 departure of DJ Switch, he 
is also now the main creative force behind Major Lazer, 
a project that has birthed great tunes such as “Pon de 
Floor” (later sampled by Beyonce for “Run the World 
(Girls)”), “Original Don,” and the mellow “Get Free.”
Diplo remains one of the most sought-after producers 
in music today, mainly because of his reputation for 
catching on to the next big thing. Let’s just hope the 
next big thing he ?nds is a bit less gluteal.

For those who want an old-school scare on Halloween, 
The Conjuring is the perfect ?lm, adept in style and 
suspense. The ?lm works off the “true story” of real-
life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren 
(played by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Patrick Wilson 
and Vera Farmiga, respectively). One of the best 
horror movies in recent years, The Conjuring uses the 
playbook for traditional scares from classic horror ?lms, 
but creates moments of fear that are entirely original. 
Fun fact: These investigators’ famous hauntings were 
so horri?c that they reportedly inspired The Amityville 
Horror. Now that’s a scary Halloween story.

Scary Movie
Friday, Nov. 1   8, 10
While it’s no Paranormal Activity, Scary Movie is the 
?rst of a hilarious horror comedy franchise that provides 
goofs and laughs during a spooky season. Starting out 
jokingly like most horror ?lms, Scary Movie follows a 
group of dumb teenagers who clumsily try to escape a 
serial killer called Ghostface after receiving a threatening 
phone call. Scary Movie parodies the heck out of classic 
slasher ?lms such as Scream and I Know What You 
Did Last Summer. Meanwhile, it is inventively funny and 
enjoyable for those who would rather just laugh and skip 
out on the scares this Halloween.
World War Z
Saturday, Nov. 2   7, 9:30, 11:59
You know what’s a great combination? Brad Pitt playing 
a guy named Gerry — if you can believe it — and 
zombies. In this heart-stopping action ?lm, Gerry is a 
retired UN of?cer recruited to save the world in the midst 
of a zombie apocalypse. Gerry must travel around the 
world to investigate the apocalypse’s origins, and single-
handedly ?nd a cure. World War Z provides a fresh and 
thrilling rush of action and has enough brains to keep the 
momentum going throughout the globetrotting plot. Brad 
Pitt also looks especially good when saving a world of 
less-than-lovely-looking zombies.

Find last-minute Halloween inspiration
Dr. House, Bat-Fleck, and Walken to the Sky are among this year’s costume possibilities
 Kate Groschner | Photo Editor
Digging through your closet for last-minute Halloween 
garb can be a daunting process. What kind of costume 
can you make out of totally mundane items? Check out 
this list for a few inventive, punny, and very last-minute 
ideas.
1. Dr. House
Dig through your closet and find your favorite graphic 
tee and blazer combination. Then grab a cane, an empty 
pill bottle, and some tic-tacs (using real Vicodin is not 
recommended). The key to this costume is to periodically 
consume the Tic Tacs and wager on other people’s lives 
— or simply stand around and scowl severely.
2. Superman
This simple option just requires stenciling an “S” and 
finding your best impromptu cape. Underwear outside 
clothing is optional.
3. Little Red Riding Hood
For this quick costume, grab a red-hooded robe, black 
clothing, and a basket full of cookies. A wolf mask begs 
the question, “Did the wolf eat Little Red? Or did Little 
Red kill the wolf?”
4. Bat-Fleck
You can be the hero Halloween deserves by donning a 
cowl and black cape as Batman. Embrace the newest 
portrayal of the Dark Knight by adding a dash of Boston 
pride to the mix.
5. Walken to the Sky
Combine one of Hollywood’s most distinctive actors with 
campus’s most unique art installation in one terrible, ter-
rible pun. All you need is a blue shirt, cotton pads from 
Entropy+ to make your clouds, paper and markers for the 
sun, a picture of Christopher Walken from your printing 
queue, and some tape.
