Council Gives 
Suggestions to 
New Members
Recommendations Aimed 
To Help Next Year’s 
Body to Function
CARNEGIE’S ANNUAL 
MAY BE ABOLISHED
Make Suggestions for Amity 
Between Organizations, 
Student Council
The retiring 'Student Council, at 
its final meeting last Tuesday, 
handed down to the 1933-1934. Coun­
cil a detailed list of recommenda­
tions intended to facilitate the 
functioning of next year’s Council 
on the campus.
Among the individual recommen­
dations is that regarding the 
Thistle, which may be discontin­
ued unless the new staff can show 
suffcient evidence that the annual 
will be a financial success during 
tlie coming year, or unless they can 
supply a workable plan for its 
financial improvement.
It was also recommended that all 
non-athletic organizations, such as 
the Interfraternity and I liters ofr- 
ority Councils, Women’s Dormitory 
Council, and Scabbard and Blade, 
be notified of their existence un­
der Student Council, and of the in­
vitation to place their accounts un­
der Council. This action would 
involve no intervention by Council 
unless the organizations so desig­
nate.
The Social Chairman of Council 
will continue his activities in liix*- 
ing bands', according to Council 
recommendations. The elimination 
of the appreciable fees paid to the 
middleman or booking agent in­
sures the( continued functioning of 
the office*in the same capacity.
The detailed list of Student Coun­
cil recommendations, as presented 
to next year’s Council by Ira 
Kuhn, chairman of this year’s rec­
ommendations* committee is as fol­
lows:
GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. That all non-athletic organiza­
tions, as per ruling in the Caf- 
negie White Book, be notified 
of their existence under Stu­
dent Council.
2. That the several organizations
which have been operating in 
the past separately from Stu­
dent Council, namely: Inter­
sorority Council, Interfrater­
nity Council, Men’s Dormitory 
Council, Women’s Dormitory 
Council, be written letters ask­
ing for their co-operation in 
view of the fact that 'Student 
Council is responsible for their 
actions.
3. That each of these organiza­
tions be asked 'for their annual 
report at the same, time as all

cepted are placed in a three-year 
training course. The course con­
sists of a year in studying sys­
tems in the offices of customers, a 
year in service work, and a year 
in sales training work. At the end: 
of this Lime, if the man shows 
promise, he is ready to start work 
ias a senior salesman. District 
Managers are promoted from the 
ranks of salesmen, and a large 
percentage of the high ranking po­
sitions in the company are filled by 
men who have been promoted from 
the sales department.
Those who obtain positions 
should inform the bureau, so that 
effort will not be wasted in recom­
mending men for positions who are 
already employed. The bureau at­

marks the close of the twentieth 
year of the Department of Drama 
where studenls are Lrained in the 
arts of acting, production and play- 
writing. The past season has been 
a highly successful one, both from 
the standpoinL of pleasing the pub­
lic as well tas from the viewpoolnt 
of the department to whom prepar­
ing- students for a professional 
career is paramount.
During the year patrons have 
filled the theater at each perform­
ance and a long line of non-ticket 
holders has awaited the opening 
of the doors to secure the few 
seats that, might bo unoccupied. 
The plays ranged from comedy of 
a specific locality Lo Shakespeare 
and included "Th<? Virgin God­
dess” by Rudolph Beslor who 
modeled his play on Greek drama; 
Ibsen's "Pillars of Society;” “Tho 
Ivory Door,” and fantasy for adults 
by A. A, Milne; "Alison's House”

Miller Carnegie’s Greatest Swimmer
Pal Miller, who transferred from 
Stevens, is the greatest swimmer 
ever to represent Carnegie. This 
statement is based upon the fact 
that Pal has scored more points 
than any other Carnegie swimmer 
has ever scored. When he came 
to Carnegie, Pal had been out of 
competition for several years. Dur­
ing his first year on the team he 
had a hard time finding himself, 
but was nevertheless high scorer 
for the year. During his three 
years of competitive swimming at 
Carnegie he has averaged ten 
points a meet. Pal has been an­
chor man on the relay team for 
three years, .and has many times 
come from behind to pull the team 
to victory. He holds the school 
record in the 50 and 100-yard 
sprints. At the intercollegiate 
championships last year Pal placed 
in three events more than any 
other man competing. At the pres­
ent time there are no men in the 
school who even approach the 
times which Pal has made in his 
specialties—the 50 and 100. This 
year he took two first place's 
against a strong field from Pitt.
The tennis team at Carnegie re­
ceives very little publicity. True, 
it is not a major sport here, but 
Rufus Hartig, captain of this year's 
team, deserves much credit for the 
fine record which he has compiled 
during the last, three years. Last 
year he attained that goal to which 
every Carnegie athlete aspires— 
victory over a Pitt opponent. After 
the completion of Carnegie’s sched­
ule Rufus entered the Western 
Pennsylvania Tennis Champion­
ships. 1-Ie reached the quarter 
finals in the men’s singles, and 
was a member of the mixed dou­
bles team which was runner tip.

The Tartan track team closed 
their season last Tuesday, with a 
victory over Grove City, winning 
71J/&-633/&. The whole meet was run 
in a downpour of rain that made 
the track hardly distinguishable 
from the nearby lily pond, and the 
field men found it hard to stand up 
on the mushy field. The Skibos 
far outshone the local men on the 
track by collecting seven of the 
eight first places but were almost 
as badly outclassed in the field 
events.
Coulter, the Skibo flash, ran for 
his last time under the Plaid, and 
closed his career in his usual 
style by garnering three first 
places. The poor condition of the 
track prevented Tom from breaking 
any records as he intended to do. 
In spite of this Tom tied the school 
record for the century dash during 
the early part of the meet, while 
the track was fairly firm, by run­
ning it in ten second fiat. His other 
two wins came in the 220-yard 
dash and the broad jjump.

"Looie Blooey” Jagnow and his 
famed lire ball still seems to be a 
great mystery to some of Car­
negie’s best batsmen, for last week 
lie allowed only one run in four­
teen innings of mushball. In the 
final game last Thursday lie stop­
ped such killers as Stewart, Clis- 
bee, Dueger, and Sample and 
brought the mug to Kappa Sigma 
boys for the second straight time. 
The score was 3-1.
The Betas were badly handicap­
ped by the absence of their bril­
liant pitcher and slugger, Red Fer­
gus, but nevertheless they made 
the going hot all the way. Dueger, 
brought into pitch from his regu­
lar position at short stop, hurled 
flawless ball after a wobbly first 
inning.
The Kappa Sigs landed on Due­
ger in the very first frame, buc 
after that they went down In quick 
order. Gibson opened the first in­
ning with a neat double to left 
center, and Northy was safe on a 
scratch hit. Smith forced Gibson 
at third, but Jagnow doubled, scor­
ing Northy and Smith. Rigg and 
Graham popped out to end the 
frame.
The Betas put Jagnow in a bad 
hole in the sixth, and it looked for 
a minute as if the Jackson, Mich., 
lad was in for a sad time. Biggin 
opened the inning with a single, 
but Goodrich whiffed. Becker sin­
gled, advancing Biggin to second. 
Leonard walked, Clisbee flied to 
Nortli3r, and Jagnow forced in a 
-run by passing Dueger. Carlson 
ended the inning by grounding 
out to Croft.
- The Kappa Sigs scored their 
final run in the last of the sixth 
when5 Bobbie Smith scored on a 
freak triple and a bad throw from 
the outfield.
The game was fast from the 
start, and good pitching and bril­
liant fielding prevailed. Jagnow 
and Smith were the whole show 
for the Clyde Street house, while 
Stewart and Carlson played un-
Roger Burke, sophomore half 
miler, was elected to the captaincy 
.of the 1934 Carnegie track team, 
at a meeting held last Wednesday. 
Burke is the third 'Sophomore in 
succession to gain this position, 
Barger and Coulter having been 
elected in the same fashion both 
holding the position for two years. 
Burke has had a Frank Merriwell 
sort of record, coming as a fresh­
man without previous experience 
¦he broke the cross-country mark 
and tied the S80-yard record in his 
first year. In the Pitt meet this 
year he scampered over the half 
mile distance'in 1:59.9 to shatter 
the old school record of 2:01.& 
without much difficulty.. This year 
has also been a successful one for 
Burke as he has gone through with 
only one defeat and that under 
bad conditions. He Is one of the- 
most promising men on the squad 
and can be counted upon as a point 
winner for next year.
Burke is a member of the class of 
’35 in works management and is 
treasurer of the Industries senate- 
He is also a member of Pi Kappa 
Alpha social fraternity, the Scimi­
tar, sophomore honorary, and is. 
a member of Delta Skull, the junior 
honorary for men.
COACH GUY HALFERTY'S 1933 TRACK TEAM brought its season to 
a elose Tucaday with a hard earned victory over Grove City. Thio 
meet was cignificant In aeveral wayn. In the firct place it was the last 
meet for Tom Coulter under Plaid colors; Tom was probably the great­
est all-around athlete over to compete at Carnegie, and he will be 
greatly missed next year. The sccond significant event was the elec­
tion of Roger Burke as next year’s track captain. Burke v/ill be only 
a junior next year, but already be has established himself as one of 
Carnegie's finest trackmen. We trust he will prove a capable leader. 
Good luck, Roge!*****
SPEAKING OF UNSOLVED MYSTERIIOS whatever became of the in­
tramural bridge tournament? For a. while there seems to be a lot of 
enthusiasm for the gentle sport of finessing queens, but with the com­
ing of warm weather Jt seems to have been left on base. In the Alpha 
league there was a. dog fight between the Alpha Sigs, the T. X.’s, and 
the K. D. ll.’s while in the other league the Beta Sigma Ilho's had the 
championship in the proverbial bag. It looks as If the playoff will be 
held over until someone can afford to buy a new deck of cards.
AT LEAST ONCE IN THE LIFETIME OF EVERY SPORTS WRITER 
comes the craving to name an All-Star team of some sort or other, so 
I am taking this opportunity to select my All-Carnegie mushball team.

In History of School 
All Fine Leaders
Kappa Sigs. AB. R. H. O. A. E.By WILLIAM BECKER
Commencement at Carnegie this 
year brings with it the exodus of 
some of the finest athletes ever to 
take iij) the gauntlet thrown down 
by Professor Geckeler and his co­
horts. Among these are more than 
the usual number, who, not content 
with local fame, have carved for 
themselves a national reputation. 
The withdrawal of Sample, Kavel, 
Fergus, Smith, Coulter, Miller and 
Hartig from active competition 
will leave a hole in the ranks of 
Carnegie’s athletes which our 
hard-plugging couches will find dif­
ficult to fill.
Our brilliant co-captains, Hooks 
Sample and George Kavel, consist­
ently supplied the Carnegie root­
ers with thrills in an otherwise un­
exciting football campaign. Hooks 
is probably the greatest guard ever 
to enter Carnegie, while George is 
the hardest running back seen 
around these parts for many a day. 
Those fans who, last November 
saw Hooks spend an afternoon in 
Pitt’s backfield will not soon for­
get it, just as they will noL forget 
his classic demonstration of 
“weaving and bobbing” in the 
Georgetown game. Throughout the 
season George Kavel covered him­
self with glory, and in the final en­
counter with Georgetown realized 
his greatest ambition. In his last 
minute of college competition 
George ran ninety-nine yards for a 
touchdown. Just to prove to the 
boys that they were not yet has- 
beens, Hooks and George proceed­
ed to lead the alumni to a victory 
over the up and coming varsity in 
a spring practice game. Incident­
ally both Sample and Kavel man­
aged to reap several All-American 
mentions during their college ca­
reers.
Fergus, Smith Great Courtmen
Not to be outdone by the foot­
ball squad, the basketball team 
also operated under a co-captaincy 
this past season in the persons of 
Red Fergus and Bobbie Smith. One 
can see that the easiest way out of 
fhe difficulty of awarding the cap­
taincy, with two such sterling play- 
I ers eligible, was to name them 
both. Both Red and Bob gave am­
ple* justification for their appoint­
ments during the past season. 
When Red transferred to Carnegie 
from Ohio State he went out for 
the freshman team, and, much to 
his surprise, he made it. Ho rap­
idly improved, and in his past, 
three years of varsity competition 
1ms repeatedly been chosen, by 
Carnegie's opponents, as one of 
the most, formidable guards it was 
ever their misfortune to face. In 
spite of an early season injury, 
which handieappod him throughout 
the season, Red was mentioned 011 
several All-American teams, .lust, 
as reliable 011 the ot.hor end of the 
court was Bob Smith, Carnegie's 
star forward, For three years Bob 
has boon high scorer among the 
college basketball players of this 
district;, ills high-scoring ability 
has likewise, earned for him the 
attention of All-American boards. 
Basketball fans will attest to the 
fact that when Bob is on the lloor 
there is seldom a dull moment. 
Truly, it will bo a long time be­
fore Carnegie's basketball team is 
again graced by two such stars.
Coulter Was All-Around Athlete
For three years Tom Coulter— 
the big Canuck—has been known 
as Carnegie’s one-man track team. 
This year, not satisfied with lau­
rels won 011 the track and field, he 
branched out and acquired the rep­
utation of Carnegie’s most versa­
tile athlete by securing a position
011 both the football and boxing 
teams. His reputation as a. one- 
man track team is well earned as 
is evidenced by the fact that in 
one meet he has taken as many as 
five first places. Tom holds sev­
eral Canadian national records, 
and last year represented Canada 
at the Olympic games. Never hav­
ing played football before, the abil­
ity which Tom displayed this past 
season was all the more remark­

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN. TUESDAY. MAY 30. 19333
‘CARNEGIE EVER HOLD HER MEMORY DEAR'
MoazxoWSKi Op ¿i
Within Carnegie’s arched halls are ghosts of days that used to be—Some
times, it seems, as twilight falls they whisper softly to me—and
as the shadows on the campus are lengthening as night draws liear—they
Remember last fall when the 
door bell rang, I mean school bell,
<0d/ we found ourselves in the 
-wa/ting line all, anxious to enroll 
for a year of knowledge-getting, 
etc., etc., etc.? What a milling 
crowd that was when we were 
waiting to affix our signatures to 
the five miles of red tape. We 
were thirsting for knowledge and 
hoping that the line would dwindle 
so that: we could get up to the 
cashier’d desk and part with our 
moneyJnoi the inflated, or should 
I say deflated, kind? That was be­

Remember the numerous ques-

capacity of thinking, were put to 
you when you were in the line?
One would almost need a Baedeker 
n order to get around. First you

lere, and then you went some-

t that you shouldn't have left

Plaid Staff Bids 
Farewell to All 
With Last Issue
softly whisper love Carnegie and forever hold her mem’ry dear
George LeRoy Williams Wins Prize
Well, here we are at the end 
of another school year and the 
Plaid, finds itself issuing the last 
number for 1932-33.
To say that this has been a year 
of trials and tribulations is put­
ting it mildly. The whole coun­
try seemed to have been imbued 
with the feeling of unrest and no 
matter what project was undertak­
en, there was an underlying feel­
ing that, perhaps, the venture 
would vfall by the wayside. Evenj 
our school activities and problems 
were subjected to the severe tests 
of the times and that they emerged 
from the fray on top is indicative 
of the sterling qualities of those 
who motivated and sponsored these 
activities.
The Tartan, and when we say 
Tartan we include the Plaid, has 
been subjected to the same fire of 
adversity and even with all the 
ramifications, handicaps, and what­
nots, there has never been a slip­
up in the issue of the weekly and! 
the student body hats not been 
subjected to any disappointment.
To those students who made up 
the staffs of the paper, and also I 
to those students who in any way i
Ticket Returns 
Still Incomplete
There are still some tickets out 
on the dances held by the Night 
Student Council. As the commit­
tee on Insignia Awards cannot 
complete its work until all the out­
standing tickets are returned stu­
dents having any tickets are urged 
to send them in at once. This is 
the last time this notice will ap­
pear as there will be no more is­
sues of the paper. Returns should 
be mailed to John F. Simpson, 
Treasurer, Night Student Council.

Technology, Schenley Park, Pitts­
burgh, Pa.
Please make your returns at 
once so that the proper credit can 
be given and the awards made.
After the registration ordeal was 
'er we were given time to reflect 
nd then start on our tour of 
nowledge-getting. The fun-pro- 
oking problem of locating our 
class' rooms was a source of en- 
.oyment and it gave one an oppor­
tunity 91 exploring the campus, 
that -is, if you didn’t get lost, es­
pecially in the Engineering Build­
ing if you happened to get in the 
upper floors and missed the 
“Bridge of Sighs.”
Following the locating of your 
class rooms came the all important 
feature of renewing of old ac­
quaintances and friendships. This 
was almost like a family reunion 
of the Joneses, Smiths, Souths, or 
for that matter any family. Pleas- 
ries were exchanged, notes corn­
ed, happenings recounted, and a 
¦eral all around talk session was 
1. And, by the way, in the re- 
fal of old acquaintances, wasn’t 
ic good to behold our good old 
friend and spokesman, Dad Man- 
son? He that knew what was what 
and where was where, so to speak, 
if you follow his advice you 
¦ere sure to be right.

of
"Carnegie, Ever Hold Her Mem­
ory Dear," which was written by 
George LeRoy Williams, was
chosen as the best selection in 
the lyric contest sponsored by 
Dragon, men’s senior class 'honor­
ary. Mr. Williams, a former day 
school student, who is now study­
ing mathematics and physics in 
night school, has received the 
prize of $25 for his contribution. 
Wilfred Woiiand, a former archi­
tectural s/udent, was awarded hon­
orable mention. The words to the 
winning piece were written to the 
music of “Germania” from the or­
chestral suite “From Foreign 
Lands” by Moszkowski.
The music was selected a few 
years ago by Dr. Thomas S. Baker 
¡is a fitting selection for a new 
Carnegie song. At that time he 
suggested that suitable words be 
written for it by one of the student 
body, but 110 definite action was 
taken until the Dragons adopted 
the idea this year.
This contest was open to all stu­
dents and alumni of Carnegie. The 
contestants submitted their lyrics 
under pen names or numbers. The 
composer’s real name was given 
in a sealed envelope with the pen
name or number on the outside. I 
These envelopes were not opened 
until Call Day, when the presenta­
tion was made by Ira Kuhn, Dragon 
representative.
After the name of the winner 
was maxle known, the song was 
sung for the first time by the mem­
bers of the Delta Tau Delta social 
fraternity, winners of the Inter­
fraternity Sing.
The judges were selected in or­
der that their views in giving the 
final decision would reflect not only 
the opinions of people specialized 
along the line of music, but also 
those of disinterested persons and 
those of the students. The special­
ists were represented by Dean 
Glendinning Iveeble, chairman of 
the Fine Arts Faculty and Prof. 
Hulda.li .1. Kenley, assistant pro­
fessor of public school music. Mr. 
Lawrence H. Miller, supervisor of 
equipment, represented the indif­
ferent point of view. Shorey 
Allan, junior in the Department ofj 
Printing, expressed the views oL’ | 
the students.
"Carnegie, Ever Hold Her Mem-1 
ory Dear” will be published in tliej 
new Carnegie Song Book and Plebe 
Bible.
credit is due.
And so, we come to the close of 
another school year. Partings are 
taken of friends made, some to dis­
tant points, but there is a feeling 
that although the possibilities of 
seeing one another are somewhat 
remote, there still remains a con­
soling fact that we can recall to 
memory the pleasant occurrences 
during our school life and we can 
live again those happy hours spent 
•at Carnegie.
It is, therefore, with a feeling of 
pardonable pride at the work ac­
complished during this trying year 
of 1932-33 that the Plaid bids 
adieu.
Student Council Give 
Advice to New Rodv
finally we settled down 1o the 
k of class room assignments 
all that goes with them. Of 
iTse, I was 011 the side lines 
iking 011 as my forte was to see 
, hear all, but do little, and the 
igest part of the whole thing is, 
n can’t imagine how well I got 
ng with the task. I’ll tell you 
it was a great time while it 
d. Speaking for the others, 
aver, it must have been rough 
.ding. I noticed one drop out 
re, another drop out there, some 
a ore drop out over there, and 
finally when I came to check up 
at tihe end of the first semester I 
found out that half of those I 
knew from the registration line 
were in the line of the missing. 
Guess the ordeal was too much. 
Who was to blame, I cannot say, 
but the fact remains that they 
were not at the post when the 
final gun was shot, and facts are 
facts.
Those pesky examinations were 
too much for some of us, and too 
little for most of us that when the 
next election comes around I, am 
going to vote a slip ticket so that 
one can slip through the eagle-eyes 
of some of these dispensers of 
knowledge. Yes sir, knowledge is 
a great thing and I am here to say 
that I take off my hat to the man 
who can get by one of our Eudlidic 
contests which are staged periodic­
ally throughout the semester.
Of course, all was not grind, 
grind, grind. There was some en­
joyment in store for those of us 
who were inclined to indulge in 
a little of the activities which 
transpire and lake place on the 
night campus. For instance, look 
at all the smokers, dances, and 
Tther opportunities we had of get- 
together, and of course, I 
n;edn’t mention our engineering 
junquet when most of us get a 
cj1ince to have a square meal and 
py ourselves away from the din 
turmoil of the class rooms, 
.look at the good times those 
1 Jers had helping to doll up the 
Lnasium to make it look what 
fjain’t." But these happenings 
I only episodes in the lives of 
.u'night students.
Some other bright spots were 
the! numerous holidays, or rather 
holinights we had. I believe some 
eight or ten of them are included 
in the night schedule. These are 
times when one can sit back and 
enjoy a* night of rest and quiet, 
that is if your assignment was not 
too big or too burdensome, or you 
were not behind with your work.
Thus another year is chalked up 
against us and we come to the 
parting of the ways. Time is ever 
igT^tout goes the old, in comes 
e new, it was great while it last- 
... I won’t last long though 
I don’t say “So long until.” That

That Student Council sponsor 
and promote the building of a 
bell and clock tower. A com­
mittee in charge of this promo­
tion should consult the Presi­
dent and members of the facul­
ty who have expressed a de­
sire for such a tower 
and a willingness to con­
tribute their personal services. 
Future building plans of the 
school must be taken into con­
sideration, and possibly it, 
would be better to establish a 
temporary structure with the 
idea of incorporating the bells 
and clock from said temporary 
structure into a tower as part 
of one of the new buildings. 
Each department could con­
tribute its services, but the 
money for the building of such 
a tower will have to be obtain­
ed from some other source than 
Council.
Still another idea is the pro­
motion of a central activities 
building. Considerable thought 
should be given to this as the 
sooner such a building is es­
tablished the better it will be 
for all persons concerned.
THISTLE
It is tentatively suggested that 
the Thistle, annual of the college, 
be discontinued until the staff 
which has been elected for the 
year 1933-1934 can present Stu­
dent Council with sufficient evi­
dence that its issue of 1933-1934 
will be successful. This recommen­
dation is made in view of the con­
tinued liability of the Thistle dur­
ing years past, together with the 
small percentage of student sup­
port, approximately 10 per cent.
ANNUAL REPORT
That the annual reports of all 
organizations under Student Coun­
cil be repeated because they in­
struct the coming Council and give 
definite check to the outgoing 
Council and the organization un­
der Council.
Council or those whom he may 
so cjesignate with the exception 
of the pledge ca/ps and arm 
bands which are handled 
through the Student Council 
Treasury.
ELECTIONS
That all elections for school 
offices shall be under the su­
pervision of the Chairman of 
Elections.
That this Chairman be respon­
sible for any general election 
¦ pertaining to or involving the 
entire student body.
That a draft-form be printed 
of a petition blank to be used 
in the filing of any petition for 
any office or any business to 
come before the Student Coun­
cil. A petition presented on 
any other than these forms 
will be invalid.
That this latter fact be pub­
licized at the beginning of the 
year.
That the Chairman of Elec­
tions shall appoint the staff for 
each election for counting bal­
lots subject to the approval of 
the Executive Committee of 
Student Council;
ACTIVITIES KEYS
That all tentative lists of keys 
to be presented shall be turned 
in in time for the keys to be 
purchased for delivery before 
the date for the Spring Carni­
val.
That at the same time the ten­
tative list of next year’s men 
to be given awards and re­
wards be filed.
That all organizations under 
Student Council continue.
BUDGET COMMITTEE
Thai more emphasis be laid on 
budgets, and that all students sub­
mitting budgets absolutely stay 
within the amount allowed for each 
item and no transfer of allowance 
from one item to another be per­
mitted.
FRESHMAN REGULATIONS
That the Student Council 
Chairman of Regulations shall 
be in direct charge and re­
sponsible for the actions of the 
Board of Regulations whose 
members shall consist of the 
following: Chairman of Regu­
lations, the presidents of the 
four Senates, the presidents of 
the .Dormitory Councils, the 
president of the Scimitar So­
ciety, and the president of the 
Cwen Society.,
The subcommittee should 
consist of the presidents of the 
respective Senates as chair­
men, the three underclass pres­
idents, freshman, sophomore, 
and junior, and all members of 
the Scimitar Society and the 
Cwen Society.
That the sale of all regulation 
equipment shall be taken care 
of by the president of Student
SPECIAL COMMITTEE
The 1934 Council should use 
extreme, caution and care in 
accepting the petition from the 
Arts Senate that the next Arts 
Ball be placed in the hands of 
the Senate, giving them full 
control of all complimentary 
tickets. This recommendation 
is given with full considera­
tion of all facts in the hands 
of this committee which feels 
that such action on the part of 
the 1934 Student Council will 
disrupt the entire scheme of 
Council and will result in ad­
verse criticism both from the 
student body and the faculty. 
That some definite understand­
ing between the parties con­
cerned be arrived at, is neces­
sary in order that a recurrence 
of this year’s experience with 
the Arts Ball Committee be 
forestalled.
FOREIGN POLICY COMMITTEE
1. That the Chairman shall be­
long to the Cosmopolitan Club 
of Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology and attend several

form Council when and where 
the meetings of the Cosmopoli­
tan Club and F. P. A. are to be 
•held in order that any member 
on or outside the Council may 
attend
PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE
. That the constitutions of all 
publications be submitted to 
the Student Council of 1933- 
1934 (for approval.
. That the outgoing editors of 
the various publications go 
over the constitutions pf their

that, they make recommenda­
tions to pass along to the next 
year’s Student Council for its 
consideration, revising and 
bringing up to date constitu­
tions of the several publica­
tions.

composed of the samie members 
as of the year 1932-1933: Social 
Chairman of Student Council, 
Executive Secretary of Stu­
dent Council, and Treasurer of

Communication with music 
corporations is to be taken care 
of by the Social Chairman, and 
it is recommended that such 
communications be started im­
mediately after the approval of 
the social calendar for the 
coming year. In this way the

Science Displays 
Feature World 
Fair in Chicago
The World's Fair, A Century of 
Progress Exposition, opened last 
Saturday at Chicago. Illinois, with 
hundreds of exhibits depicting tlio 
transformation of the past century 
as a result of tlio cooperation of 
science and industry. Chicago it­
self. in attempting to tell tlio 
story of man’s achievements in the 
past hundred years, has grown in 
that period from a small town to a 
world metropolis.
The Exposition is of special in­
terest to those whose careers are 
or will be, in the scientific field, 
for the greatest part of the grounds 
are devoted to those displays
which explain how the discoveries 
of science have made available to 
humanity new means of transpor­
tation a;'^ •---•.nniuniea.tion, new
methods 61 »..anufacturing, new
weapons for lighting disease, and 
new comforts and conditions of 
living unthought of a hundred years 
ago. History, music, architecture, 
agriculture, and many other phases 
of modern civilization are being 
featured.
A reproduction of the antedelu- 
vian world has been made for an­
thropologists. By means of me­
chanic creatures animated by hid­
den motors, cams, and remote con­
trol devices, the world of a million 
years ago is seen with hairy mam­
moths. sabre-tooth tigers, and pre­
historic cave-men.
Of interest, to the student .of 
physiology is the “transparent 
man,” composed of cellon, a vis­
ualization of the human anatomy 
without the aid of X-rays. And as. 
tronomers may find, in the Adler 
Planetarium, an artificial sky, the 
heaivens. swept across the dome of 
the building by a huge projecting 
machine.
Those students who have had 
little opportunity to travel may 
see various picturesque foreign 
buildings, in which are stationed 
peoplo hi national costumes, dis­
playing the arts and handicrafts of 
their native lands. Students inter­
ested in sports may attend the va­
rious competitions I11 football, 
baseball, track ovents, outboard 
motorboat, races, boxing, wrestling, 
swimming, diving and archery.
Of universal attraction is the 
"Sky Itlde” in cable cars' 200 feet 
above tlio earth, between two Im­
mense, triangular towers, 2,000 feet 
apart.
The Exposition grounds are bril­
liantly lit,, and, at. night, are visible 
for miles around Chicago, the vari­
ous displays Including scintillating 
colors, luminlscent and Irridosoont. 
features, water falls, flaming py­
lons, and shadow and vapor offoets.

1908 will celebrate the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of their graduation.
Other classes to held their re­

last time until 1938 that the class 
of 1933 will be able to meet and re­
new acquaintanceships. It is also 
the time when they will add their 
class memorial plate to the pattern 
of memorials started five years ago 
when the 1908 Class presented the 
large brass floor plate which start­

pamphlet which a group of junior 
and senior students In the Secre­
tarial Department originated and 
published this year, was dedicated 
in Its last Issue to departing sen­
iors. Tlio junior editors assumed 
entire responsibility for tills Issue, 
with Loretta Con I In as editor-in- 
chief, and Alice I-Ienzl as assistant, 
editor.
Miss Winchester, head of the 
Secretarial Department, has an­
nounced that, because of Hu 
crowded routine of most of the 
girls this year, the department 
will probably not havo a picnic as 
was expected. It. Is hoped, how­
ever, that a mother-daughter tea 
may be given for the secretarial 
students in the early fall.
SIGMA ALPHA IOTA
Miss Gertrude Evans, president 
of the national organization of Sig­
ma Alpha lota, oldest women’s 
professional honorary musical sor 
orlty in the world, visited the Car­
negie chapter last week-end. She 
has been visiting all the chapters 
of the Pittsburgh district in order 
to inspect and grade each chapter 
in regard to its standing among 
all the chapters of the organiza­
tion.
Various social activities were 
held during Miss Evans’ stay. On 
Saturday evening a dinner and bus­
iness meeting were held, followed, 
on Sunday, by a tea and dinner. 
After a dinner on Monday evening, 
the chapter attended the perform­
ance of "Distant Drums” at the Lit­
tle Theater.
Miss Evans, who is active in 
many college affairs, is also vice 
piesident of the Women's Pan- 
Hellenic Association. She comes 
here irom Ithaca, New York.

An Asset to College 
Students
College men and women, 
accustomed to regulating 
their own expenditures and 
planning their own budgets 
are receiving valuable train­
ing In handling money that 
will prove beneficial In after­
life, In this connection, a 
bank account Is an import­
ant asset to people of col­
lege age. The Mellon Na­
tional Bank Is always glad 
to receive the accounts of 
college students.

Speed the Five-Year Course
Advocates of a five or six-year engineering* course may see 
iji the recent action oi: the Educational Senate in reducing by 
ten hours the freshman curriculum in the Colleges of Engineer­
ing and Industries further evidence that the longer course may 
not be so far in the future. The need of engineers for a more 
than technical training has been recognized at Carnegie and at­
tempts have been made to meet this need by the inclusion in the 
curriculum of a few so-called general subjects. However, it was 
difficult to add any more to what was already a crowded tech­
nical program. The attempt to do five or six years’ work in 
four obviously wasn’t to meet with success. A reduction in the 
curriculum of the freshman year was most needed and this was 
effected by reducing the requirements in Industrial History 
from nine to six units and the number of two-hour shop courses 
from three to two. Beginning next September, five hours will 
thus be cut from each of the freshman year semesters.
It is difficult to understand the opposition to a longer 
course. Certainly if the engineering profession is to rank with 
those of law, medicine, and dentistry, a broader training must 
be provided. The day when an engineer could be successful by 
knowing only the narrow confines of his special field is gone. 
There is no reason why some effort cannot be made to provide 
the engineer with the means to gain a greater appreciation of 
life. Perhaps such subjects as biology, political science, 
, psychology, public speaking, salesmansliip, history, and art will 
not add to his material gains from litie—and then again they 
may. But certainly his life will be a richer and fuller one if lie 
has made some study of subjects such as these.
The argument that the cost of the longer course would be 
prohibitive is often raised but this is not tenable when it is 
realized that students preparing for other professions manage 
to carry the longer course. Another feature which must be 
considered is that students are being graduated] from colleges 
at a younger age'than formerly. They could well afford to 
spend one or two more years in school before entering their 
profession.
Certainly it will be difficult for any one school to make the 
first step toward the longer course. Each will'fear the imme­
diate effect on its enrollment. The problem is one for college 
associations to consider and, if combined action is taken by 
these groups, the change can be made quite easily and the pro­
fession of engineering raised to an even liigh plane.
Join the Alumni Federation
For the past few weeks, the Carnegie Alumni Federation, 
. a federation of the alumni associations of the four colleges, has 
been campaigning for new members among the graduating stu­
dents in an effort to increase the ranks of organized Carnegie 
alumni.
The main purpose of the federation is to band together 
Carnegie graduates and to maintain alumni interest in cam­
pus activities. After, four years of undergraduate life it is 
hard to realize that in a few months outside of school there 
may be a complete break with the college. Experience ol! for­
mer graduates has shown that it is only by a positive effort 
on, the part of the majority of the graduates that they will 
maintain even a moderate amount of interest in their college 
after graduation. No surer way to guarantee continuity of 
interest exists than to establish definite relationship with the 
college through enrollment in the alumni organization.
Inasmuch as .the federation is entirely self-supporting a 
small fee is charged for which each member receives several 
publications and is informed when undergraduate and alumni 
activities take place.
Paying the alumni4fee will purchase a permanent bond with 
your Alma Mater!
Campus Honoraries
Tau Beta Pi, national engineer­
ing honorary, was founded at Le­
high University in 1885 for the 
. purpose of conferring on technical 
students the same distinction 
given to liberal arts students by 
Phi Beta Kappa. The fraternity, 
which has risen to a point of rec­
ognized professional standing, has 
grown and prospered until it now 
has 63 chapters and over 21,000 
members
The objects of Tan Beta Pi, ac- 
~ cording to its constitution are: “To 
mark in a fitting manner those 
men who have conferred honor 
upon their Alma Mater by a high 
grade of scholarship as undergrad­
uates or by their attainments as 
alumni, and to foster a spirit of 
liberal culture in the engineering 
schools-;.of America.”
The Carnegie chapter chooses its 
members from the upper eighth of 
the junior class and the upper 
quarter of the senior class in the 
College of Enginering. At the Fall 
call a number of seniors and three 
juniors are chosen, while in the 
Spring only juniors are called. To 
qualify for membership a man 
must not onl5r meet the scholastic 
requirements but must also be ac­
tive on the campus and have 
qualities of character, personality 
and leadership.
Regular meetings are held twice 
a month and occasional meetings 
are held with the faculty, at which 
.times open discussion of. scholar­
ship and courses offered in the Col­
lege of Engineering usually takes 
place. An award is made by Tau 
Beta.Pi each year to the outstand­
ing freshman engineering student, 
and the members of the faculty 
have pledged themselves to assist 
underclassmen who have encoun­
tered scholastic difficulties.
Carnegie members wearing the 
badge of Tau Beta Pi, which is a 
watch key shaped like the bent of 
a trestle, are: William J. Burns, 
president; Anthony Carnvale, vice 
president; Robert R. Smith, secre­
tary; Robert A. Hutchison, corres­
ponding secretary; Eari L. War-

THIS
CHANGING WORLD
By WILL LANDSBERG
President Roosevelt has literally 
assumed leadership of the world. 
Timing his message perfectly, he, 
with whom smashing precedents 
has become a habit, once again 
does the unexpected. “Disarm,’', 
he tells the world. Clearly and 
courageously sounding a challenge 
which is at once an appeal and a 
solemn warning, lie forces modifica­
tion in the Hitler declaration by 
issuing his message one day in ad­
vance of the German Chancellor. 
Abandoning diplomatic pln-asedlogy 
for every day English, he explains 
his hope to the world—“The pro­
found hope of the people of my 
country is that peace may be as­
sured through practical measures 
of disarmament and that all of us 
may carry to victory our common 
struggle against economic chaos.”
Appealing to all the nations of 
the world, he urges that they enter 
into a solemn and definite pact of 
non-aggression, reduce their arma­
ments and thus do away with the 
instruments of war. The world 
warms to his message and spirit. 
Gratifying responses are received 
at Washington.
But in Berlin the sabers have 
been rattling. Chancellor Hitler, 
facing a huge responsibility, de­
livers his message and the tension 
is relieved. Modification is greatly 
evident. His oratorical gestures 
conspicously absent, he tells the 
world—“Germany is ready at any 
time to renounce aggressive weap­
ons if the whole world bans them.” 
The world breathes more easily. 
The war scare is over, the London 
and Geneva Conferences are saved 
and a feeling of tranquillity sets 
in.
But over the Rhine the French 
are saying that the speech is “su­
perficially moderate” and an attack 
on ,tlie Versailles Treaty. France 
continues to distrust Hitler.
Meanwhile, a heartsick, frighten­
ed world now looks to the White 
House with renewed hope.
Pledging themselves to refuse to 
be conscripted into any war serv­
ice whatsoever, the Intercollegiate 
Conference, made up of students 
of colleges from the West Coast, 
re-echoes the sentiment expressed 
in si nation-wide college poll con­
ducted a few weeks ago. Here are 
the figures:—Out of 21,725 voting 
8,145 took an uncompromisingly 
pacifist stand, 7,221 would bear 
arms only in case of invasion of 
this country, and 6,089 would fight 
in a war of any character involv­
ing the United States. All of which 
shows a definite and rather re­
markable pacifistic trend which 
cannot be ignored. Deeply signif­
icant and indicative of a marked 
change in thinking on the part of 
the youth of America, in the event 
of a war this group would form a 
powerful minority. Their, stand 
involves a different definition, of 
patriotism. No longer is it the 
willingness of citizens of one coun­
try to kill the citizens of another 
but rather the willingness . to de­
cide international issues in the 
best interests of so many mu­
tually interdependent nations. 
Should the youth of the world 
come to realize this, there would 
be no doubt of world peace.
Private Banker Morgan faces a 
Senatorial Investigation and calm­
ly admits not having paid income 
tax in 1930. 1931, and 1932.
Here’s how it all happened.
A few months ago, when Con­
gress passed the Emergency Bank­
ing Act empowering the president 
to use dictatorial methods in the 
banking crisis, it tacked a rider to 
this act requiring an investigation 
into large banking interests to dis­
cover reasons for the frequent and 
numerous bank failures. Swinging 
into action, the Senate Banking 
Committee called Charles E. Mit­
chell first. In the course of the 
investigation, incidentally, the fact 
rose that Mitchell had not paid in­
come tax. The reason—Mr. Mit­
chell claimed capital losses. But 
the Committee discovered the 
Josses to be of a rather curious na­
ture. For instance—previous to 
filing income returns, Mr. Mitchell 
would sell huge amounts of securi­
ties to his wife at ridiculously low 
prices. These would be registered 
as losses. Afterwards, these wrould 
be bought back and the tax would 
be neatly avoided.
And now that almost legendary 
figure, J. P. Morgan, must face the 
music. Neither Banker Morgan 
nor any other Morgan partner, it 
is discovered, lias paid income tax. 
He, too, has suffered capital losses. 
These were incurred by making 
loans, many of which have never 
been repaid. The list naming the 
debtors reads like a Hall of Fame. 
The country’s famous had come to 
the House of Morgan to borrow. 
Banker Morgan establishes Ills 
losses on the failure of these to re­
pay.
Prosecuting Attorney Pecora 
faces a big job. He must show 
that these losses have been incur­
red in an illigitimate manner. 
The white-haired- unperturbed, 
gentleman he contends with is a 
man whose vast power is rarely 
fully comprehended. The lawyer 
he must buck is John W. Davis, 
one time Democratic presidential 
nominee. A man sized job if there 
ever was one.
FFNCE
MEET THE PRINCE—
Thinking of falls, brought to mind the 
recent antics of Carnegie’s one-man Cavalry— 
super-charger Joe Adams—who combined a Paul 
Revere ride with a Prince of Wales finish and
was one down to his equine escort when the dust
cleared away. Only last week the “Prince” was 
revealing his equestrian accomplishments to a 
group of breathless listeners and even threatened 
to bring his favorite dobbin around for a spin in 
the Bowl if anyone was so foolish as to disbe­
lieve. (On your way over Joe, did you notice on
which side a horse parts his hair?)
“It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that 
swing” so the song says and this applied par- 
Thursday. The 
Kappa Sigs had 
the swing and
took a close 
one from the
Betas in the
last interfrater­
nity doings of
the year. The 
contest was or- i finally scheduled for Wednesday but rain
forced all of the spectators into Laurel Hall at 
the end of the second inning and ended the melee. 
Everyone must have gotten well acquainted for 
the Laurel girls had all the windows and roofs 
well populated when activities got under way the 
next evening. The effect of such charming sup­
port was inspirational rather than distracting to 
pitcher Jaguow for the Jackson prodigal turned 
in a very fine mound performance while winning.
Someone remarked after- the game, “Well’s it's 
been a great year for the smaller fraternities.” 
All kidding aside though, it was a swell game— 
the kind Dr. Pafouts tells his wide-eyed freslimeu 
about—and it was a fitting climax to a fine greek 
competition season.
AW FAW DOWN—
What president of what fraternity jumped, not 
fell, out of a second story window last Thursday 
p. m. in one of the Forbes Street row of eating 
clubs? You’d think that when a fellow hangs 
around long enough to get elected president of 
such a austere group of students, he would at 
least know which window had roofs under them 
and which did not. Besides, if it’s considered 
dignified or becoming to the shepherd of the 
flock to go jumping out of windows, what, then 
must the casual observer expect of the rest of 
the sheep? Maybe that’s the way college boys 
leL down after winning design cups. Anyhow our 
good friend “No-Bounce” Clinger wasn’t hurt but 
is being looked upon as a suspicious person by 
his intimates for such peculiar performances.
SPLINTERS—
The seniors were getting that thrill of a life­
time last week—signing up for caps and gowns 
with one hand and crossing lingers with the 
other hoping that the exams won’t be so tough 
that their signing is in vain.
If the Queen didn’t get. your vote during'the 
elections, we’ll bet she got it after last Sunday’s 
rotogravure section came out. That picture was 
a winner itself. Dr. Baker's freshmen will cer­
tainly have a lot of material when they write 
their first themes next year on “Why I Came to 
Carnegie Tech.”
The entertaining twist which a receut cleaning 
powder qompany has given to its advertisements 
may be the reason for so many spotless frater­
nity wash rooms these days.
Mention of the cleaniug subject reminds us 
that Andy and Annie are all washed up. These 
handsome football players never can go with the 
same girl more than a month aiiyway (not mean­
ing to infer that your red-headed captain isn't 
handsome).
They claim that the theme for the song rage, 
“Stormy Weather,” was gotten from the mothers 
who visit their offsprings in the new Maggie 
Murph model house. You know, thecpart that 
goes, “Since my gal and 1 ate together, it's pain­
ing all the time.”
Your favorite sports editor is in dutch already. 
They just can’t agree on how the score was kept 
in that Pitt wrestling match. Johnny says that 
next year lie’ll probably write the first half of .his 
côlunm getting into new trouble and the last 
half apologizing for previous mistakes.
Rumor from Washington has it that Sammy 
Wicks, Carnegie’s new money man, is also on 
J. Pierpont’s approved list.
The boys on the track team came back from 
P li i 1 a delpliia 
with a batch of 
new stories and 
a long list, of 
telephone num­
bers. Track sea­
son is about 
over now. The 
Birch Hall girls 
will have to 
find some other diversion until the football sea­
son starts.*****
AFTER THE BALL IT’S OVER—
v Well, it won’t lie long now—only two short 
weeks until w.e all disband and call it a year. 
The social peason reaches its finale the Friday 
after exams when the seniors get together fpr 
their last undergraduate frolic. The Commence­
ment Ball is taking the place of the Senior Ball, 
for this year at loast and it’s going to be a good 
one so get the white flannels out and drop over. 
(To Thistle Hall we mean.)
LITTLE THEATER REVIEW
_________________________By ROY MINET
Dan Totlieroh’s play “Distant 
Drums,” the current Little Theater 
production, did not liaive a success­
ful Broadway run. In some cases, 
such a «statement might be taken as 
an indication of merit. "Disliant 
Drums.” in many respects, might 
be said to fall under this classifica­
tion.
Certainly Mr. Tothereroli has 
written a play which need ask for 
few favors from its contempora­
ries. The dialogue is particularly 
good, swinging along with an easy 
stride that economically estab­
lishes ’ the atmosphere of the play 
at its very opening. Minor char­
acters are sketched surely as 'un­
mistakable individuals, so surely, 
in fact, that they sometimes tend 
to break from their grouping and 
compete for attention with the pro­
tagonists.
In spite of all its excellent quali­
ties as a piece of dramatic writing, 
the play doesn’t quite click on the 
stage. Probably the chief reason 
for this .failure rests in Mr. Tot'he- 
roli’s handling of his intangible 
antagonistic elements—time, and 
over-following Indians. At no time 
do we get the «feeling that this op­
position is anything more than a 
static condition. As a consequence, 
when Mr. Totheroh depends upon 
suspense to carry the play along 
while he advances the development 
of his characters, the play flops and 
flops badly; the characters simply 
do not have our sympathy.
Mr. Totheroh undoubtedly has 
attacked a terribly difficult prob­
lem in “Distant Drums.” To devel­
op the ethereal character of Eunice 
aigainst a background of robust, 
covered-wagon characters, to accu­
rately picture a period only vague­
ly familiar to many, and to con­
cretely depict the effects of im­
portant, unseen forces upon his 
characters within the space of two 
hours would tax the abilities oi any
dramatic craftsman. That an at­
tempt to enicompa/ss such extensive 
difficulties should result in some 
obscurity of purpose is to be ex­
pected, and “Distant Drums,” like 
its characters, gets lost somewhere 
in the mountains of Idaho.
The play, however, enjoyed excel­
lent direction. Mr. Wallace supplied 
supporting business that seemed 
to discount with instinctive ease 
the staging difficulties that are na­
tive to the piece. The traits of 
certain characters were nicely 
highlighted to make more accept­
able their solution of problems 
which, though prepared for, were, 
not entirely reasonable. This 
treatment, was especially good in 
the handling of Eunice and Wolf- 
11111.
The lighting, too, was all above 
the aiverage, leaving to be desired 
only that the night scenes aiboul. 
the campfire had been more realis­
tically done, with less attention up­
on lighting the faces of characters 
who were by them sufficiently well- 
known. The setting, in spite of 
the low arch at the rear of the 
stage, achieved a high degree of realism.
The performance, on the whole, 
was excellent, full of flavor, and 
careful work. Among the players, 
Fern Ball unquestionably stood 
alone. Her portrayal of Eunice, 
the superstitious, sincere, even 
pathetic child-woman who wonder­
ed what, she was here for, was 
imore than satisfying. Janet 
Feather made Mrs. Saiwyer delight­
ful with her clear-cut, consistent, 
and easily-heard performance.
,Don Gallaghere offered the trap­
per. Quincy, as a blustering but 
kindly old fellow. Robert Gill, 
though as capable as usual, will be 
better remembered for other things 
he has done. George McCalmon 
somehow didn’t seem exactly com­
fortable as Jason Allen by.
INTERCOLLEGIATE

We finally found out the func­
tion of a college newspaper when 
we read in the UNIVERSITY OF 
BUFFALO “Bee” that, because of 
the activities of the Michigan 
Daily Newspaper, the price of hair­
cuts in Ann Arbor has been re­
duced from 50 cents to 35 cents.

Staff Appointed
Continued From Pajre 1
Manager and a member of the 
cheerleading squad.
Miss McKelvey, the new manag­
ing editor, is in the Library «School 
in Margaret Morrison, a former 
Cwen, and teasurer of last year’s 
sophomore class.
The new staff is planning to re­
vise the freshman handbook for 
next year. Although nothing def­
inite has been suggested, it is cer­
tain that the handbook will be 
completely rewritten.
A grade point ratio of 3.2 places 
a student 011 the honor roll at 
MUSKINGUM COLLEGE, but re­
cently the town council of «New 
Concord, where the college is lo­
cated, decided that none of the 
3.2 brevage may be sold in the 
town.
The U. OF SOUTHERN CALI­
FORNIA Daily Trojan reports that 
at Stanford, recently, class play was 
about to begin when someone rush­
ed in to inform a freshman ticket 
manager that ex-President, and 
Mrs. Hoover, and Dr. and Mrs. Wil- 
but were to attend—“Geez,” he 
said, “and we're all outa” comps.
In a recent issue of THE 
SPRINGFIELD STUDENT oi 
Springfield College, four and a half 
columns were devoted to a write: 
up of the Junior Prom. In the 
article, the college history of all the 
members of the committee was 
given. That Prom must have been 
a Prom!
Tulane has the distinction, if it 
may he called a distinction, of hav­
ing as many, aliasas as would do 
credit to any outstanding “public 
enemy.” Letters have been re­
ceived which were addressed as 
Touland, Two Lane, Toulaine, 
Toulane, Tulaney, Tuland and Tu-
lave. New Orleans is equally little 
known as the addresses, Grand 
Coteau, La., Tulane, Ala., and Tu- 
lane, La., indicate.
Faculty members are often ad­
dressed who have ei,ther died, re­
signed, or else—. A particularly val­
uable possession is a letter which 
was recently addressed to Paul Tu­
lane by a boy in Africa, asking for 
financial aid in getting an educa­
tion.
A senior at the University of Chi­
cago, was fooled, recently, when 
lie called a theater and asked to 
have a box reserved for two. The 
puzzled answer came back that 
they did not have boxes for two.
“Isn't this the theater?” he 
asked.
“Why, no. You are talking to 
an undertaker.”
According to the LEHIGH Brown 
and White, a course in tap-dancing 
is compulsory for all freshmen at 
TCJFTS College. Which reminds 
us that the CREIGHTONIAN re­
ports that freshmen at GUNNI­
SON College are required to walk 
backwards while on the'campus.
Anyone who does not believe that 
men are really men out west 
should read the college newspa­
pers. OZARK College claims to 
have enrolled a student who had 
never before worn a pair of shoes. 
The University of. DENVER CLAR­
ION says that the D Club has 
started a campaign to publicly re­
move the golf knickers from every­
one wearing them 011 the Denver 
campus. The CLARION does not 
state whether the campaign was 
the cause or result.-of the recent 
pants iad among film stars.
At LEHIGH University the
Campus Traditions
Painting numerals on the fence 
behind Margaret Morrison is a 
tradition handed down by the first 
class. It became a class feud 
when the freshmen of the 1910 class 
painted their numbers over those 
of the class of ,1909. This conflict 
for supremacy is renewed every 
year.
In September, 1907, the first an­
nual barbecue of the men of Car­
negie was held. This idea was 
suggested by Director iHamerschlag 
in an address to tlio uhpercluss- 
nien. “Barbecue originally meant 
a feast between barbarous tribes 
when they partook of the game 
which had been shot and roasted 
whole. I urge you to adopt this 
tradition because I believe 110 
group, if lniman beings, sit down 
to dine and carry away animosity. 
Since early times, the breaking 
of bread has been the sign of peaco, 
good will, and friendship, and sure­
ly that is the way you want to 
appear to the entering class.”
Upon tills suggestion a founda­
tion was laid for what was to be­
come one of the traditions of the 
school. 1
The first barbecue wrfs colo­
brated with a roasted ox. Then 
the students and facultty partici­
pated In wrestling matches, run­
ning, sack racing, and a greased 
pig chase. The program ended 
with a bonfire, a snake dance, and 
songs.
The class of 1907» inaugurated a 
now forgotten custom of collect­
ing overworked straw hats from 
the students on the first day of 
the fall semester to be later strung 
across the street and draped on 
tlie steps of the Industries Build­
ing. The hats disappeared after 
nightfall, and it was believed thal 
they had been fed to the scftool 
horses. The next day, all the con­
tributors sported new derbies'.
Tartan Corrects Error 
Of Last Week’s Issue
The Tartan regrets the error 
made in the Tau Beta Pi in­
itiation story under Club Notes 
in last week's issue. The Dr. 
Jones referred to as an initiate 
is Dr. Webster N. Jones, Direc­
tor of the College of Engineer­
ing. Dr. Jones was initiated at 
ceremonies in the Faculty Club 
room last Thursday.
Sword and CrescenL, senior honor­
ary society, recently abolished the 
Arcadia, student governing body, 
but no one was greatly disturbed, 
beca.use the Arcadia had abolished 
the Sword and Crescent, two weeks 
before.

that they have spent days in con­
scientious rehearsal before the play 
was ready for the public eye; that 
they have done all this while carry­
ing on tlieir academic studies; and 
will continue to do so for four 
years, until they have earned a 
bachelor's degree.
As to tlie question of what, be­
comes of drama students after 
they leave school, whether they 
really follow the stage or are 
found in totally unrelated occupa­
tions. it has recently been answer­
ed by the Department of Drama in 
a series of statistics they have 
compiled as to the number of their 
graduates in the dramatic field. Of 
those students who have kept in 
touch with the school nearly one- 
lialf are acting in the movies and 
011 the stage. Forty-five per cent 
are directing little theaters, head­
ing drama departments in schools 
and colleges, and teaching diction, 
public speaking, costume and fur­
niture design and other branches 
of dramatics. A few have become 
playwrights. Of the small number 
who have engaged In business, the 
majority have chosen vocations 
closely related to the stage, such as 
motion picture publicity, theater 
advertising and radio broadcasting.
Some of the graduates who are 
better known to Pittsburghers are 
Paul McGrath who appeared with 
¦Helen Hayes in The Good Fairy; 
and Hardie Albright who first 
gained recognition in school 
through his portrayal of Hamlet. 
Others have been members of the 
companies of Fritz Lieber, Jessie 
Bonstelle, Eva Lo Galllenne, and 
with such stars as Mrs. Flske, and 
Otis Skinner. It. was when Hardie 
Albright, was playing with the lat­
ter that, the illustrious actor men­
tioned in a curtain speech that Car­
negie had the “finest .school ot 
dramatic arts in the country.”
Mr. Peabody Appointed*
