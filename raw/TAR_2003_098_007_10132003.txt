Senate dealing with 
absentees, vacancies
by Alexander Meseguer
News Editor
The hour hand coverd the nine on 
the clock in Margaret Morrison A14 
as last Thursday’s Student Senate 
meeting came to a close. Occupying 
the same seats since 5:30 pm, the 
bare minimum number of Senators 
were present to satisfy quorum. The 
erosion of attendance from last year 
is something that may be related to 
the length of the Senate meetings. 
According to Senator Erik Michaels- 
Ober, a junior philosophy major, 
there is a big difference in the num­
ber of Senators present between the 
start of meetings and the end. At the 
beginning of last Thursday’s meet­
ing, about 29 out of the 32 total 
Senators were present, and by the 
end, only 18 were left.
Also of concern in Senate is the 
absence of Senators from 5 out of 
the 7 Senate seats for the College of 
Fine Arts and 2 of the 11 Carnegie 
Institute of Technology seats. This 
15 percent chunk of Senate is now 
empty due to resignations or 
removals over the course of the
semester by Senate Chair Vito Fiore, 
a fifth-year senior in social and deci­
sion sciences, whose position gives 
him the power to remove Senators 
when they have missed more than 2 
general body meetings without 
approved excuses.
“It’s not a decision to be taken 
lightly to remove someone,” said 
Fiore.
This semester’s CIT Senate resig­
nations include Randy Sinnott, a 
sophomore ECE major; Robert 
Andre, junior mechanical engineer­
ing major; Michael Quirolo, a junior 
mechanical engineering major, and 
Elizabeth Anderson, a sophomore 
social and decision sciences major. 
Eric Hong, a sophomore architec­
ture student, resigned his CFA seat, 
while the following students were 
removed for absenteeism: Wai-loon 
Chan, fifth-year architecture major; 
Jason Chen, senior architecture 
major; Sergio de Orbeta, fifth-year 
architecture and history major, and 
Morgan Springer, sophomore music 
major.

Heinz staff member 
given Inspirador award
by Christina Kung
Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon’s director of the 
master of science in public policy 
and management program was 
inducted into the Hispanic 
Scholarship Fund Alumni Hall of 
Fame on October 7.
As part of a gala event at the Four 
Seasons Hotel in Washington D.C., 
Martha Chavez McGivney was one 
of five to receive this recognition for 
her contribution to the Hispanic 
community. This award represents 
one of the most prestigious and 
nationally recognized honors 
awarded to Hispanic college gradu­
ates.
The Hispanic Scholarship Fund 
(HSF) is a nonprofit organization 
devoted to promoting higher educa­
tion. For over 25 years, they have 
been reaching out to Hispanic 
Americans, by providing scholar­
ships to students pursuing a higher 
degree.
“We are dedicated to strengthen­
ing the Hispanic community,” said 
Miguel Salinas of HSF.
They have awarded more than 
61,000 scholarships in excess of 
$115 million to various Latinos, 
striving towards their mission of 
doubling the the current number of 
Hispanics earning college degrees to 
18 percent by the year 2010. Every 
year, HSF will also be dedicated to 
recognizing their alumni and past 
scholarship recipients for their 
exceptional work and success. Now, 
for the second year, they have pre­
sented a series of five awards — 
Optimista, Altruista, Triunfador, 
Inspirador, and Brillante — to the
alumni inducted into the hall of 
fame. The purpose of these awards 
has been to show future generations 
real examples of people who have 
broken barriers and stereotypes to 
achieve all the possibilities educa­
tion can offer.
McGivney was presented with the 
Inspirador award, which celebrates 
breaking the cycle of under-educa- 
tion to become one of the first in her 
family to obtain a college degree. 
She arrived in the United States at 
the age of three from Guanajuto, 
Mexico. Even at this early age, she 
met the challenges of the culture 
and language barrier head on. Her 
proud father describes her as being 
“...a self starter and someone who 
gives 110 percent to whatever she 
does. She searches for new opportu­
nities to continuously challenge and 
improve herself.”
Her relentless character had 
fueled her to become an honor stu­
dent seeking advice from teachers 
and fully utilizing all the resources 
around her. She took advantage of 
numerous scholarships, one being 
the Migrant Education Program, 
which offers conferences, work­
shops and professional work experi­
ence.
“I would tell young Latino stu­
dents that they are the future lead­
ers of this country, and they should 
set the highest expectations for 
themselves to achieve their goals 
and dreams. I would also tell them 
to appreciate their family and cul­
ture, and most importantly, I would 
urge them to never give up and 
always give back to the Hispanic 
community,” said McGivney.

Student falls six feet from bed
by Michael Croland
Senior Staff
Lilian Cruz lay atop her bunk bed changing sheets. A 
moment, later, she fell six feet below. Cruz, a first-year 
chemistry major, survived the September 26 accident 
with contusions to her left hip and knee and a light 
sprain to her right ankle.
“I’m very clumsy,” said Cruz, “but I always try to make 
sure I don’t cause major injuries to myself.”
Cruz claims to have filed maintenance requests for a 
protective bed rail both online and in person in August.
In September, she was told by Housing Services that no 
such request had ever been received. She did not file a 
new request.
“One of her clues that something was wrong was that 
she never got a web acknowledgement,” said Tim 
Michael, director of Housing Services. If a student does 
not receive such confirmation, then Housing has no 
record of the request. Cruz received what she called a 
small, inadequate bed rail several days after the acci­
dent, but did not get a satisfactorily-sized one until 
October 8. Following the accident, she slept either on the

Faculty newspaper changes direction
by Hannah Yi
Staffwriter
The faculty and staff newspaper 
FOCUS has undergone several 
changes with the departure of Jim 
Davidson, FOCUS editor and adjunct 
professor of journalism for nine 
years. Davidson resigned last year to 
become ordained by the 
Presbyterian Church (USA). Lynn 
Berard, who works full-time as head 
of the Engineering and Science 
Library, was selected as the new edi­
tor of FOCUS by the Faculty Senate- 
appointed FOCUS Management 
Committee.
“When Davidson stepped down, 
Faculty Senate had a talk about their 
vision,” said Berard. “They thought 
about what to do with the paper and 
it was agreed to go back to FOCUS's 
former mission to invite and encour­
age faculty and staff writers.”
During Davidson’s editorship,
many of the articles came from stu­
dents in his Advanced Journalism 
Workshop. As a part of the course 
curriculum, students were given the 
opportunity to report and publish 
their work for practice and profes­
sional experience. This time around, 
student writers will not come from a 
course, but will participate on their 
own initiative.
“A bulk of the writing came from 
students under Davidson,” said 
Karen Schnakenberg, the director of 
professional and technical writing. 
“Obviously Berard’s not teaching so 
we set up internships instead. It’ll be 
the same as interning at the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette or City 
Paper.”
To uphold the former mission of 
FOCUS, Berard is currently working 
towards a more involved faculty and 
staff participation. Berard’s efforts 
will be facilitated by her networking 
that developed over 18 years at the 
University, a quality that was sought
by the members of the Management 
Committee.
“Only someone who has those 
deep roots, and really cares about 
the University, can notice the vital 
issues facing the University,” stated 
Otto Davis, a member of the FOCUS 
Management Committee and SDS 
faculty, in an e-mail. “Our search 
ended with the selection of Berard.”
Berard has solicited faculty and 
staff who wrote in the past for 
FOCUS. She will also approach Staff 
Council to spread the word about 
opportunities available for faculty 
and staff to write about their 
research, controversies, or concerns. 
She is currently in the midst of creat­
ing a Network Advisory Board to 
represent different areas of campus 
while keeping in touch with the 
community.
“We want to send a large message 
to faculty and staff that it’s their

International 
Festival brings 
noted author
Cristina Garcia keynotes events
by Cecilia Westbrook
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon University 
International Festival began last 
Thursday afternoon with a keynote 
address by Cuban-American author 
Cristina Garcia.
Garcia spoke in McConomy 
Auditorium last Thursday. The first 
50 attendees were given free copies 
of her latest novel, Monkey Hunting. 
She then proceeded to speak for just 
under an hour, addressing the issue 
of multiculturalism in America, 
before opening the floor to questions 
by audience members. Following the 
lecture was a reception and book- 
signing.
This keynote address was central to 
the International Festival itself, and 
reflected some of the issues that the 
organizers hoped to address. The 
theme of this year’s annual festival, in 
its 13th year, was “Exploring the 
World through Arts and Literature.” 
“Our goal is to expand people’s 
minds through arts and literature,” 
said Emily Half, coordinator of 
Student Activities for the Office of the 
Dean of Student Affairs and a major 
organizer of the festival. Much of the 
time is focused around students who 
have spent time abroad and returned 
to share their experiences. “Our hope 
is that the stories they share, as well 
as the programs by non-Carnegie 
Mellon community members, help to 
bring awareness of diversity as well 
as common ground to the larger cam 
pus.”
Garcia, as an accomplished autho 
whose work addresses the issues sur­
rounding multiculturalism, was an 
easy choice for a keynote speaker. 
Considered one of the most impor­
tant voices in Latino literature in 
America, she comes from a Cuban 
expatriate family. Her first novel, 
Dreaming in Cuban, was nominated 
for the American Book award, and 
her second, The Aguaro Sisters, 
received critical acclaim. Her most 
recent novel, Monkey Hunting, is a 
historical account of a Chinese-Cuban 
family from the 1850s through the 
Vietnam War.
“In her books, a lot of the issues she 
addresses have to do with identity, 
with living between two cultures — 
multiculturalism,” said Elizabeth 
Cerda, fifth-year architecture major 
and a member of last year’s 
International Festival committee. 
“She writes about intermingling, and 
exposure to new cultures, which ties 
in very well with the theme of the 
entire festival.”
Garcia’s family immigrated in 
1960, when she was two years old, 
and she has since grown up in various 
places in America. She says she feels 
that she never fully regained her 
“Cubanism” until later on in life, 
when she had the opportunity to visit 
Cuba and to reintegrate with her 
roots — a process which prompted 
her to begin writing.
“My Cuban experience was almost 
compartmentalized,” Garcia said of 
the divide in her life between her 
Cuban family and her American expe­
rience. Dreaming in Cuba came from 
this initial stimulus.
“I almost sort of backed my way 
into it,” she said of the novel. Since 
publishing Dreaming, she has been 
among the most prominent authors 
in the circle of Cuban-American liter­
ature.
The lecture started with a piece she 
had written on the subject of exile, in 
particular, being a cultural exile and 
expatriate.
“Perhaps the state of being in- 
between is, ironically, where the exile 
feels most at home,” she said of her 
experience as an American living 
between two cultures. Following this 
short speech, she read an excerpt 
from each of her novels and 
explained the personal significance 
they had in her life. Along the theme 
of the festival itself, she talked about 
her experience with multicultural­
ism.
“To live between two cultures, I’ve 
come to believe, is to be doubly 
blessed,” she said. “To live between 
two cultures and languages is to 
understand both better.”

Garbage Can Fire, 10/03/03, 
9:52 pm — Two Campus Police offi­
cers responded to a call that heavy 
smoke had been seen in Porter Hall. 
The officers noticed smoke billow­
ing out of a garbage can by the first 
floor entrance and extinguished the 
fire in the garbage can with a near­
by fire extinguisher. The officers 
then propped the door open to ven­
tilate the area. Upon further inves­
tigation, the officers determined 
that the cause of the fire was a bag 
of burnt popcorn that had set the 
garbage can liner on fire.
Intoxication, 10/04/03, 2:23 
am — A CMU police officer on a 
routine patrol near the fraternity 
quad observed a female CMU stu­
dent vomiting near the wall of New 
House. The officer made a call to 
CMU EMS, which called for a City 
Medic Unit prior to arriving at the 
scene. The student stated that she 
had consumed five to six mixed 
drinks at a friend’s house on Craig 
Street. CMU EMS cleared the stu­
dent to go home for the evening, 
and the officer issued the student a 
citation for underage drinking. The 
student’s parents were notified.
Theft by Deception, 10/04/03, 
1:20 pm — A student flagged 
down a CMU police officer on 
Margaret Morrison Street and stat­
ed that somebody had just robbed 
him. The student said that he was 
on his way to the Margaret 
Morrison laundry room when a 
white vehicle stopped in front of 
the plaza. He stated that a black 
man, about six feet tall with a thin 
build in a white shirt, blue jeans, 
and a dark baseball cap, exited the 
vehicle and asked the student if he 
had change for a $50 bill. The stu­
dent said he gave the man two $20 
bills and one $10 bill, and that the 
actor then gave the student what 
appeared to be a rolled up $50 bill, 
but turned out instead to be a 5- 
euro bill. A physical altercation 
then ensued, with the student 
being punched several times by the 
other man. The man then entered 
his vehicle and fled west on 
Margaret Morrison Street. He left 
behind a navy blue baseball cap 
with a New York Yankees insignia 
on it. The officer spoke with five 
witnesses to the crime, one of 
whom had written down the vehi­
cle’s registration number, then took
the cap and 5-euro bill as evidence. 
The vehicle’s registration number 
was checked and came back nega­
tive as stolen.
Report of Missing Person, 
10/05/03, 11:11 am — A student 
contacted CMU Police to report 
that his roommate had not been 
seen since October 2,2003 at 8 am. 
The two students share a room in 
Margaret Morrison Apartments. 
The student stated that his room­
mate had been acting normally, 
and while on the phone with 
Campus Police, he received a call 
from a friend of the roommate’s, 
who said that the roommate had 
possibly gone to Niagara Falls for a 
few days. CMU Police attempted to 
contact the roommate’s friend but 
was unsuccessful. Student Life was 
notified.
Hat Theft, 10/06/03, 4:25 pm 
— A student called CMU Police to 
report the theft of his hat. The stu­
dent claimed that a classmate had 
taken his hat from him in the Wean 
Hall 5200 cluster. Though the stu­
dent initially recovered the hat, the 
classmate took the hat again while 
the student was waiting for a print­
out and stated: “You’ll get your hat 
back after I find out some informa­
tion.” Two officers were dispatched 
to investigate reports that the class­
mate had gone to Porter Hall to 
attend a meeting of the KGB club. 
Upon arriving at the meeting and 
inquiring after the classmate, the 
officers observed the classmate 
running out the rear doors of the 
room. Another officer arrived and 
observed the classmate entering 
Baker Hall by way of the 140 cluster 
area door. The officers watched 
him go up the stairwell near room 
239, but failed to locate him.
Theft from Locker, 10/08/03, 
11:22 am — A student contacted 
Campus Police to report that sever­
al items had been removed from 
her purse. The purse had been in an 
unlocked locker in the University 
Center women’s dressing room 
along with her clothes, and upon 
returning to her locker, she found 
that the purse was missing. The 
student searched the area and 
found her purse in a stall. The purse 
was open and her wallet had been 
removed. The student stated that 
$20 and her American Express card 
had been taken from her wallet. 
The student immediately contacted 
American Express to cancel her 
credit card.
Theft of Textbook, 10/08/03, 
10:35 pm — An officer responded 
to a call originating in Hunt Library 
concerning a stolen textbook. Prior
to the officer’s arrival, the student 
who had placed the call searched 
the area and checked the library’s 
“lost and found” without locating 
the textbook. The student told the 
officer that she had left her Human 
Resources Management textbook 
on the desk at which she was seat­
ed, and that, after walking away for 
fifteen minutes, she had returned 
to find the textbook missing. The 
textbook is valued at $90. The offi­
cer spoke with a librarian at the cir­
culation desk about the theft, and 
the librarian suggested that 
Campus Police might distribute 
more crime prevention flyers to the 
library for the librarians to place at 
each table.

Record-breaking 
play defeats Pitt
PITTSBURGH (AP) — None of 
the great runners in Notre Dame’s 
past — George Gipp, Paul Hornung, 
Ricky Watters, Jerome Bettis, Allen 
Pinkett — ever did what Julius 
Jones did against Pittsburgh.
Jones broke the school’s single­
game rushing record with 262 yards 
and scored twice. The Fighting 
Irish, the nation’s eighth-worst 
rushing team, surprised the No. 15 
Panthers by switching to a power 
running game in their 20-14 upset 
victory Saturday night.
“It was just a great day for us,” 
Jones said. “Things just opened up 
for us. I was fortunate enough to get 
a lot of carries and the line did a 
great job.”
The Irish (2-3) turned two Pitt 
turnovers into scores, again disrupt­
ed quarterback Rod Rutherford 
with their constant pressure, and 
revamped their offense during a bye 
week to beat Pitt (3-2) for the third 
straight season.
Only two weeks after throwing 
62 times for 297 yards in a 23-10
loss to Purdue, Notre Dame nearly 
abandoned its passing game fresh­
man Brady Quinn completed only 
five passes for 33 yards to repeated­
ly run at a Pitt defense that has 
allowed 1,480 yards in its last three 
games.
Afterward, the Panthers didn’t 
know what hit them or, for that mat­
ter, what the Irish hit them with.
Jones, who ran for 718 yards as a 
junior in 2001, broke the record of 
255 yards set by Vagas Ferguson 
against Georgia Tech in 1978.
So much for the talk that Notre 
Dame, which has played five consec­
utive ranked opponents and has 
Southern Cal up next, was headed 
for a 1-7 start.
“I think the weakest part of our 
game has been the running,” Notre 
Dame coach Tyrone Willingham 
said. “We wanted to see if we can 
improve and once we did that, we 
wanted to continue it.”
Jones had 94 yards by halftime, 
including touchdown runs of 25 and 
49 yards. He kept piling up the yards 
in the second half, even though the 
Irish’s only second half scoring was 
D.J. Fitzpatrick’s 34-yard field mid­
way through the third quarter that 
made it 20-14.
Jones added a 61-yard run during 
an eight-minutes-plus Notre Dame 
drive that consumed most of the
fourth quarter and kept the ball from 
a Pitt offense desperate to prevent 
the Panthers’ second upset loss in 
three games. They were beaten by 
Toledo 35-31 on Sept. 20.
Fitzpatrick, replacing Nick Setta as 
the kicker, had given Notre Dame the 
lead for good at 17-14 with a 19- 
yarder 33 seconds before halftime, 
after Derek Landri recovered 
Rutherford’s fumble at the Pitt 8.
Earlier, William “Tutu” Ferguson’s 
fumbled punt just four plays into the 
game gave Notre Dame the ball at 
the Pitt 34.
Jones ran for 10 yards on second 
down, then scored from the 25 less 
than three minutes into the game to 
give a preview of his big game to 
come.
Harris repeatedly warned his team 
that Notre Dame’s defense was much 
better than the Irish’s record would 
indicate, and he was right.
Rutherford, the nation’s leading 
passer, completed only 12 of 30 pass­
es for 167 yards and was sacked eight 
times, just as he was in a 14-6 loss at 
Notre Dame last season.
Nearly all of Pitt’s offense was con­
densed into a two-minute span. 
Rutherford hit star receiver Larry 
Fitzgerald on a 23-yard touchdown 
pass on the final play of the first 
quarter, finishing a 52-yard drive. 
Fitzgerald has at least one scoring
catch in 10 consecutive games.
Ferguson, making up for his earli­
er lost fumble, then returned a punt 
71 yards to the Irish 4, and 
Rutherford immediately hit 
Fitzgerald in a corner of the end 
zone behind cornerback Vontez 
Duff for the touchdown.
But Fitzgerald, averaging a 
national best of 145.8 yards receiv­
ing, was held to only about half that, 
79 yards on five catches.
Notre Dame beat Pitt for the 11th 
time in 12 games since 1987. The 
Irish are 22-2 following a bye week 
since 1984.
Arizona student 
caught hacking
(U-WIRE) TUCSON, Ariz. — 
University of Arizona officials 
caught a student hacking into the 
university’s Integrated Learning 
Center computer network Friday, 
gaining access to passwords and e- 
mail accounts of all those using com­
puters in the center.
The student was using a software 
program on his laptop to search the 
network for computers in use. In so 
doing, he had access to all informa­
tion on the ILC network, said Mike 
Bernardo, a senior support systems 
analyst at the ILC.
The student’s unauthorized soft­
ware program shut down the net­
work, alerting Center for Computing 
and Information Technology work­
ers and library officials that there 
was a problem.
When school security officials 
arrived, the student was still at his 
laptop, illegally accessing the server, 
Bernardo said.
Library and CCIT staff members 
confiscated the laptop and held the 
student in a meeting room. It was 
there that the student admitted to 
using the illegal software that shut 
down the network, Bernardo added.
Bernardo was one of the staff 
members who walked in on the stu­
dent.
“He was very calm when we 
caught him,” he said. “We took him 
to another room and he explained 
what he was doing.”
The student did not say why he 
was accessing the server and did not 
admit to anything more than 
“snooping.”
UAPD was called in to take the 
student into custody. No charges 
have been filed because the police 
computer forensics department 
needs to continue their investigation 
of the student’s laptop.
This is the fourth time in the past 
month that UA networks have 
crashed in this fashion.
Palestinian PM to step 
down for new gov’t
RAM ALL AH, West Bank (AP) — Interim 
Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia told 
the ruling Fatah party Sunday he does not 
intend to seek the job when a new cabinet is 
formed in three weeks, Fatah officials said.
Speaking after a meeting of the Fatah cen­
tral committee, Qureia said a new government 
would be formed in three weeks “with a new 
prime minister, too.”
If Qureia follows through, he would be the 
second Palestinian prime minister since last 
month to give up the job because of disputes 
with Yasser Arafat. However, with several 
more weeks in his term, he could reach a com­
promise with the Palestinian leader that 
would keep him in office.
Qureia currently heads an emergency tem­
porary cabinet appointed by Arafat a week 
ago. When that cabinet expires in early 
November, Qureia was to have formed a more 
permanent cabinet to be confirmed by 
Palestinian legislators.
Under an agreement worked out Sunday, 
Qureia and the six emergency cabinet minis­
ters sworn in last week would serve their 
remaining three weeks without a security 
chief, Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil 
Shaath said. Legislators would not be asked to 
confirm them.
I At the end of that period, Qureia and the 
cabinet would resign and a new government 
would be formed and presented to the legisla­
ture for approval, a senior Palestinian official 
said.
Suicide bomb in Iraq 
kills six, frightens city
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — A suicide attacker, 
stopped from reaching a hotel full of 
Americans, detonated his car bomb on a busy 
commercial avenue Sunday, killing six 
bystanders, wounding dozens, and terrorizing 
the heart of this tense city.
A witness said a guard shot at the approach­
ing car, apparently stopping it 50 yards short 
of the Baghdad Hotel, the closely guarded 
home to officials associated with the U.S. 
occupation.
Members of Iraq’s 25-seat interim 
Governing Council are also believed to be 
staying in the hotel. One, Mouwafak al-Rabii, 
told al-Jazeera satellite television he suffered 
a slight hand injury.
Elsewhere in Iraq, hundreds of thousands of 
Shi’ite Muslims staged a religious festival in 
the holy city of Karbala, stirring religious fer­
vor as a young, radical cleric sought to chal­
lenge the U.S.-led coalition and the Governing 
Council.
The suicide car bombing came four days 
after another in the northern Baghdad slum of 
Sadr City killed at least 10 people at a police 
station. A string of unsolved bombings begin­
ning in early August, including an attack on 
UN headquarters here and has killed more 
than 100 people.
The six killed Sunday were all Iraqis, said 
U.S. Army Col. Peter Mansoor of the 1st 
Armored Division. Al-Kindi Hospital was 
treating 32 wounded, four in critical condi­
tion, said Dr. Ahmed Mustafa of the hospital. 
The attacker was also killed.
L. Paul Bremer, the U.S. civilian administra­
tor for Iraq, quickly issued a statement on the 
attack, saying, “We will work with the Iraqi 
police to find those responsible and bring 
them to justice.”
“The car was in front of us, a 1990 Toyota 
Corolla,” said Sabah Ghulam, 37. “He sudden­
ly turned into the hotel.... A policeman shot at 
him four times, and then there was the explo­
sion.”
The car “was traveling at high speed,” said 
another witness, Sevan Armin, 33, who had a 
slight head injury. “The guards at the gate 
fired on it. The car hit the concrete blast barri­
er and exploded.”
The force of the 12:45 pm explosion blew 
down a half-dozen sections of the barrier, and 
shattered brick walls up to the third floor 
above the site. Windows were blown out of 
buildings as far as three blocks away. The blast 
also rattled the windows of the Palestine 
Hotel, home to many international journalists, 
a quarter-mile away.
Yankee players may be 
charged for Sat. fight
BOSTON (AP) — Boston police are investi­
gating a fight between two Yankees and a 
Fenway Park worker who was cheering for the 
Red Sox in the New York bullpen during the 
AL championship series Saturday night.
The Yankees’ 4-3 win over the Red Sox, to 
take a 2-1 series lead, had already been 
marred by brushbacks and brawls. Before the 
ninth-inning bullpen incident, Boston ace 
Pedro Martinez threw Don Zimmer to the 
ground as the 72-year-old Yankees coach pre­
pared to throw a punch.
Assault charges could be filed against 
Yankees players Jeff Nelson and Karim Garcia, 
police spokeswoman Mariellen Burns said, 
but she backed off earlier police statements 
that charges would be filed.
Red Sox spokesman Charles Steinberg said 
Paul Williams, who works for the grounds 
crew, contended that Nelson and Garcia 
attacked him.
“The Red Sox are terribly concerned and 
distressed about the attack on our employee 
tonight,” he said.
The Yankees denied the players were to 
blame.
“A security incident like this would never be 
tolerated at Yankee Stadium,” president 
Randy Levine told the Associated Press. 
“Unfortunately, there was an atmosphere of 
lawlessness that was allowed to be perpetrat­
ed all day long. The events of the entire day 
were disgraceful and shameful, and if it hap­
pened at our ballpark, we would apologize, 
and that’s what the Red Sox should do here.”
Two murder suspects 
escape, one injured
WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) — An inmate- 
who escaped down a 60-foot-long rope of bed- 
sheets removed a seventh-floor jail window 
without the aid of any tools, and similar win­
dows are also vulnerable, the warden said 
Sunday.
Hugo Selenski, suspected of the murders of 
five people found buried in his yard, escaped 
Friday by climbing down a rope assembled 
from 12 prison-issue bedsheets, Luzerne 
County Correctional Facility Warden Gene P. 
Fischi said. Selenski remained at large 
Sunday.
The escape occurred at about 9:30 pm, near 
the end of a two-hour period during which 
individual cells are unlocked and inmates in 
the overcrowded maximum security unit are 
permitted to socialize.
Selenski, 30, and cellmate Scott Bolton 
walked into another inmate’s unoccupied cell 
and removed the same window that was taken 
out in a failed 1990 escape attempt, Fischi 
said. The earlier attempt prompted the jail to 
weld windows to their frames, install bolts, 
and add a layer of wire mesh to the interior.
Fischi would not offer any further details on 
the escape, or say how it was known the two 
had no tools. He said additional precautions 
were now in place.
Bolton fell from about five floors up during 
the escape and suffered broken bones and 
internal injuries. He was hospitalized in criti­
cal condition.
It wasn’t known whether Selenski received 
any help from outside the prison before or 
since his escape, said Luzerne County District 
Attorney David Lupas.
It’s unclear how Selenski and Bolton were 
able to gather the 12 sheets, Fischi said, but 
four came from their own beds. A few other 
maximum-security unit inmates were missing 
sheets.
Lupas criticized prison officials for allowing 
Selenski to wear nondescript civilian clothing 
and for giving the men access to a broom han­
dle that might have been used to pry open the 
window.
Selenski’s lawyer, Demetrius Fannick, said 
neither he nor any of Selenski’s family mem­
bers have heard from him. A phone call 
Selenski made from prison less than two hours 
before the escape was to his girlfriend, 
Christina Strom, but she said he did not men­
tion his plans.
“She was completely shocked when the 
police showed up at her door,” Fannick said.

Mayor threatens to 
privatize city EMS
PITTSBURGH (AP) — Ambulance 
service in Pittsburgh will be privatized 
if the firefighters’ union doesn’t agree 
to consolidate the fire and emergency 
services bureaus into one department, 
Mayor Tom Murphy said on Thursday, 
October 9.
Murphy is seeking $15 million in sav­
ings annually through such a merger. 
His proposal also calls for the elimina­
tion of 200 to 300 senior-level jobs in 
the fire department.
The city could contract with hospi­
tals for paramedic service, Murphy 
said.
“That leaves the firefighters I think in 
a very precarious position, because 
they will be out there without any justi­
fiable reason for the size of the Fire 
Bureau,” he said.
Firefighters were spared from a .17 
percent cut to the city’s workforce 
announced in August.
The union bargained for a no-layoff 
clause in a 1997 contract with the city 
and Murphy agreed to extend that con­
tract in 2001 during a tight mayoral 
election.
Fire Fighters Local 1 President 
Joseph King said the new demands by 
the mayor are unfair.
“I’m being asked now to reopen an 
agreement by my membership — and, 
oh, by the way, once you pass this, 200 
of your young firefighters no longer 
have a job tomorrow,” King said. “So 
who’s being reasonable and who’s 
being unreasonable?”
King also questioned whether the 
city would be willing to spin off para­
medic service because of the revenue it , 
generates through medical transporta­
tion fees.
Murphy warned that the union could 
face a backlash from the Legislature 
that may create a financial oversight 
board to make spending decisions for 
the city, which is facing a $60 million 
budget deficit.
Should the merger take place, 
Pittsburgh would join a growing num­
ber of cities that have combined fire 
and EMS departments. Of the nation’s 
200 largest cities, 71 percent have com­
bined services, according to a 2001 
study in the Journal of Emergency 
Medical Services.
Pittsburgh diocese 
rated “compliant”
PITTSBURGH (AP) — A preliminary 
report gives the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Pittsburgh high marks for 
compliance with the U.S. bishops’ 2002 
rules for responding to complaints of 
sexual abuse.
While it was only a verbal report, 
auditors on Friday told Bishop Donald 
Wuerl they had concluded that “the 
leadership, personnel and operations of 
the Diocese of Pittsburgh are worthy of 
commendation,” said the Rev. Ronald 
Lengwin, spokesman for the diocese.
Auditors have been asked to inter­
view key personnel and review docu­
ments in all of the U.S.’s 195 Catholic 
dioceses to determine if they are in 
compliance with the U.S. Catholic 
Bishops’ 2002 Charter for the 
Protection of Children and Young 
People.
A written report following the five- 
day audit at the Pittsburgh diocese is 
expected to be delivered within two 
weeks.
“The preliminary report has shown 
that the Diocese of Pittsburgh is in full 
compliance with the Charter for the 
Protection of Children and Young 
People on all 14 of the relevant articles 
of the audit instrument, and with the 
spirit and letter of the charter,” 
Lengwin said.
The National Lay Review Board, 
which the U.S. bishops created to over­
see their response to sexual abuse scan­
dals that came to light in 2002, has said 
that the public report on the audits, 
expected to be released in December, 
will name any dioceses that are not in 
compliance with the charter.
Police officer gets j
one year for lying i
PITTSBURGH (AP) — A former city 
police officer convicted of lying about 
responding to a domestic dispute at 
Chief Robert McNeilly Jr.’s home was 
sentenced to a year in federal prison 
Friday.
In July, a jury found Edmond 
Gaudelli Jr. guilty of lying during a 
1999 deposition in a lawsuit he filed 
against McNeilly and other officials. 
Gaudelli had frequently clashed with 
his superiors and was fired in 2000.
In his lawsuit, Gaudelli, 36, claimed 
he was retaliated against for not cover­
ing up a domestic dispute between 
McNeilly and his wife — a dispute 
authorities say never occurred. 
Computerized 911 records introduced 
at Gaudelli’s trial indicated there was 
never a call to McNeilly’s home for a 
domestic dispute.
Gaudelli could have been sentenced 
to as many as 2 1/2 years in prison.

strong personality, asked questions 
»ranging from her Cuban heritage to 
what she feels about multicultural- 
ism as a whole.
Continuing through Saturday,
• October 11, the Festival opened up 
'many opportunities to learn about 
cultural diversity and awareness, 
v - “We’re hoping to try and create an
atmosphere of creation and explo­
ration,” said Half. The festival com­
prised a series of workshops, both 
dance and craft-oriented, as well as 
demonstrations of arts from differ­
ent cultures, dance and musical per­
formances, and “personal journeys”: 
short lectures where students who 
have studied abroad shared their 
experiences with an audience. The 
festival is arranged every year by the
International Festival committee, 
composed of students, faculty, and 
staff who are in charge of organizing 
the events and inviting the guests. 
This year’s theme was a bit different 
from the themes of recent years. “We 
wanted to bring something exciting 
[to campus] that would involve the 
audience,” said Cerda. “In the past, 
[the festival had] been really lec­
ture-based.”
Student falls from bed,

'HOUSING, from pageAl
floor or in her boyfriend’s room. L Housing found a bed rail request 
for Cruz’s room, a triple in Donner, 
c but says that it was from 
‘ September 2002. 
f “I didn’t request the bed rail,” 
" said Susan Chudd, last year’s sole 
occupant of Cruz’s current triple. 
¦ Chudd, who was the Community < Advisor for Donner, confirmed that 
no bed rail was ever installed dur- 1 'ing her residency. Many mainte- 
f ‘nance requests have had dating 
•! errors.
* • Until The Tartan pointed out a 
' -glitch in the system on Friday, an 
f unknown number of students were
'told that their requests would be \ 'installed by dates that had already r ‘passed. This error was caused by 1 Housing staff’s using the wrong 
form.
• “They said it would be complet- 
' ‘ed three months before I filed it,” 
’ -said Lauren Chikofsky, a first-year
CIT student. Chikofsky requested a 
bed rail for her loft in late August, 
and was told it would be completed 
by mid-June 2003. After complain­
ing five times, she finally received 
it on Friday. It is unclear whether a 
similar dating problem caused 
Cruz’s request to be mislabeled and 
ignored.
Students’ complaints about the 
maintenance process are crucial to 
1 improving the system, but Michael 
'said feedback is infrequent. 
‘ “Housing began an incentive last 
v spring to combat this problem; stu­
dents who evaluate how their hi .' -maintenance requests were per- 
f formed qualify for a monthly draw- 
'¦ lhg of $100.
; r “There was no question relating 
c to whether they did what we had
v requested/’ said Nikka Mathur, a
if,
sophomore IS major and last 
month’s contest winner. “Maybe it 
isn’t their priority to see that we get 
what we want.”
The survey form, which has 
been used for about five years, 
includes an open-ended space for 
comments and a section about 
whether the job was finished. Most 
questions on the survey pertain to 
communication,, timeliness, and 
cleanliness. Although the mainte­
nance process has its flaws, 
Michael is still confident in it as the 
avenue to distribute bed-rails.
“If someone wants one, they can 
request it,” said Michael. “Over the 
years, students haven’t wanted 
them and they’ve been removed.”
Only three students have been 
injured from falling out of beds in 
recent years, according to Michael. 
The injured students appreciate 
the purpose of the bed rails.
“If a person’s never been on a 
bunk bed, the whole sense of how 
high up you are and where you are 
when you sleep is just distorted,” 
said Cruz.
Joohoon Lee, a sophomore ECE 
major, fell out of his loft a year ago 
and hit his head against a drawer. 
He needed 11 stitches. Lee agrees 
with Cruz and favors the wide­
spread installment of bed-rails.
“You never know when and how 
the accident will happen,” he said. 
“Accidents like this can be prevent­
ed.”
Michael emphasized that the 
vast majority of students in lofts 
and bimk-beds do not fall out, and 
many choose to remove the bed- 
rails.
“We haven’t reached the conclu­
sion yet that we need to mandate 
bed rails,” said Michael. “The solu­
tion is that we let students control 
the process.”

The Inspirador award was present­

devotion and dedication.
“Her enthusiasm for the Hispanic 
community is amazing. She is unique 
in the sense that she has dedicated 
her life to it,” said Salinas.
After receiv­
ing her bache­
lor’s degree in 
economics from 
the University of 
California at 
Berkeley, she 
went to CMU on 
a full scholarship 
for a master’s 
degree in public 
policy and man­
agement. She 
then went on to 
become a Presidential Management 
Intern for the U.S. Department of 
Education, where she was able to 
work on national education policy 
issues. Then she returned to Carnegie 
Mellon where she currently plays a 
key role in helping advance the Heinz 
School’s diversity efforts. This univer­
sity has helped her in many ways to 
expand her horizons. She feels much 
indebted to Carnegie Mellon.
“I have had the opportunity of a 
lifetime to assist aspiring students

paper,” said Berard. “FOCUS allows 
them to express their academic free­
dom while discussing issues that con­
cern them.”
Whitney Hess, a senior profession­
al and technical writing major who is 
one of the four student writers for 
FOCUS, said that this year things are 
different.
“Faculty themselves are more 
involved than in the past. You’ll see in 
the issues that there are columns 
written by faculty members who are 
not a part of the FOCUS staff,” she 
said.
However, FOCUS and Berard are 
not only concerned about garnering 
more faculty and staff writers, but are
looking to communicate relevant and 
important campus issues.
According to Davis, FOCUS’s ambi­
tion is to have 
articles that 
inform the 
community, 
help frame the 
debate, and 
stimulate the 
discussion on 
both the prob­
lems and hopes 
of the
University. 
There are seven 
issues through­
out the year 
that are sent to all faculty and staff on 
campus. Students may receive a copy
ruee aoEHEn
upon request.
The first issue will be available 
sometime later this month. The end 
result of each issue will be a collabo­
rative effort of faculty, staff, and stu­
dents.
“We are not approaching topics as 
student or faculty concerns, but as a 
campus and community concern,” 
said Hess. Faculty and staff who have 
seen editors come and go at FOCUS 
are in anticipation.
“I remember enjoying the argu­
ments and reading some striking 
stuff in FOCUS,” said Robyn Dawes, a 
professor of SDS. “Now it’s just yah 
yah yah. Maybe it will change.”
“After a few issues come out, peo­
ple will see a difference,” said 
Berard.
Chair deals with resignations in Senate
SENATE, from page A1
are the write-in candidates. A good 
number don’t realize how much work 
Senate requires,” said Senator Steven 
Kling, a junior ECE major.
According to Fiore, the only accept­
ed excuses are due to academics or 
personal emergency, as Senate 
expects members to give meetings a 
high priority.
The United States Student 
Association petition vote that 
occurred two Thursdays ago had 10 
absences, not including empty Senate 
seats. Those absences were mostly 
due to the vote’s timing, late in the 
meeting, which lasted almost three 
hours. Five out of the 10 absentees 
had academic excuses to leave the 
meeting early.
The excuse policy changed since 
last semester to be more restrictive 
than it had been in the past. Fiore 
believes this policy crack-down is 
what accounts for the increase of 
average unexcused absences per 
meeting from 3.3 last semester to 4.4 
this semester.
Senate has had meetings in the 
past that have gone on for 6 or more 
hours with strong attendance when 
controversial issues are involved, 
according to Kim Kinder, fifth-year 
architecture student and longtime 
secretary for Student Senate.
“Senate’s personality has changed 
dramatically over the past 5 years,” 
said Kinder, who has been with the 
organization since her first year.
Kinder said last year’s meetings 
were usually about an hour long and, 
in general, people did not leave early. 
However, this year has seen meetings
lasting an average of 2 hours and 36 
minutes, which is an hour longer 
than the last two semesters, accord­
ing to Fiore. Kinder characterized the 
lengths of this year’s meetings as 
more typical of the Senate overall 
and described the Senators as being 
less apathetic than last year, leading 
to longer periods of discussion on the 
Senate floor. Fiore agreed, saying 
that in the past, only a few people in 
the meetings were vocal and that 
today there is lively debate with 
many people participating. Kling also 
agreed.
“There is more new business this 
year and more debate on it.... it’s a 
good thing.” However, Kling recog­
nized that Senate’s discussions put 
markedly more emphasis on smaller 
issues than in previous semesters.
“There was more debate on recog­
nizing the [new Lutheran club this 
year] than allocating $10,000 to [the 
Activities Board] for Carnival last 
year,” he said.
Kling said that meetings may be 
longer this semester because Senate 
is considering diploma issues, raising 
the activities fee, and lots of Funding 
and Recognition motions.
“Long Senate meetings are not due 
to lack of preparedness. There are 
more controversial issues. Lots of dif­
ferent viewpoints, ways of looking at 
these things. We’re arguing over 
what is the best way to interpret the 
bylaws or constitution or funding,” 
said Senator Nicholas Scocozzo, 
sophomore in biomedical engineer­
ing and chemical engineering.
At the last Senate meeting, Fiore 
brought up points of discussion on 
limiting debate in some way to pre­
vent Senate meetings from being 
unnecessarily long.
“In regards to discussion limits, 
these will be tried as a test for the 
next couple weeks — they are com­
pletely in line with Robert’s Rules of 
Parliamentary Procedure and are 
intended to prevent a few voices from 
overpowering the debate. Even many 
of the Senators who have been most 
active in debate agree that this 
change will likely be a benefit to the 
body. We shall see,” wrote Fiore in an 
email.
The 9 resignations and removals 
have already been partially made up 
for by recruiting efforts earlier in the 
year which filled one CIT and one 
CFA seat. The remaining 7 vacancies 
are being addressed by a poster cam­
paign which will target the buildings 
where CFA students are located, such 
as the CFA building and Purnell.
“[Senate] does a good job with 
postering and getting the word out,” 
said Kling. Michaels-Ober is leading 
the effort. He is posting color posters, 
bulletin boards and on misc.market. 
Fiore and Michaels-Ober pointed out 
that the chronic problem with CFA is 
due to class assignments and the non­
standard hours when students work.
“CFA is a blatant violator of the 
moratorium policy,” said Fiore.
The moratorium policy to which 
Fiore refers is the University’s policy 
that classes not be scheduled 
between the hours of 4:30 and 6:30 
in the afternoon without permission 
from the vice president for enroll­
ment.
“CFA has lower extracurricular 
activity across the board,” said 
Michaels-Ober.
Reasons Why You Should 
Take the R.A.D. Course
According to the American Medical Association (2000), one of every four college-aged women is 
a victim of rape.
According to the Department of Justice (December 2000), 1.7% of U.S. college women were 
raped during 1996-97 school year, and another 1.1% were victims of attempted rape.
Of the over 2.3 million women who reported sexual assaults in the United States from 1973- 
1987, 71% of the victims avoided being raped by taking self-protective measures.

(vwiv. nature, com/nsu).
Taylor, Hounshell, and Rubin 
focused on patents that were 
secured in the early 1970s, at the 
advent of the Clean Air Act. At the 
time, the government set strict laws 
to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions 
from power plants that used coal as 
fuel.
Because power plants were forced 
to comply, inventors had an incen­
tive to compete for the best technol­
ogy to meet the plants’ standards. 
The number of patents filed for sul­
fur dioxide “scrubbers” increased 
from eight to over 70.
In this case, competition not only 
helped power plants meet govern­
ment standards, but research shows 
that the scrubbers became more effi­
cient at reducing sulfur dioxide 
emissions than was required by law.
“There is no natural market for
whether a regulation is passed. If the 
cost is too great, then legislation 
does not get passed until the solution 
is something that both industry and 
taxpayers can afford.
Taylor also studied how long it 
took for the cost of the sulfur dioxide 
scrubbers to come down.
Hopefully, trends of cost reduction 
from the past can help predict cost 
reduction of new technology in 
future.
At the end of their paper, the 
researchers wrote, “The demand for 
various types of pollution-control 
equipment is almost inseparable 
from the details of environmental 
legislation.”
Taking cost and innovation into 
consideration, the environment 
stands to benefit when legislators 
pass aggressive pollution-controlling 
regulations.
First-year hacks 
into stock account

Junior Staffwriter
“Without govern­
ment actions, 
there is no incen­
tive to develop 
[environmental] 
technology.”
— Ed Rubin
When the government sets strict 
environmental policies, technologi­
cal change occurs quickly.
That is what Margaret Taylor, 
2001 doctoral graduate of Carnegie 
Mellon, found in research for her 
dissertation.
Taylor, now an assistant professor 
of public policy at the University of 
California at Berkeley, worked with 
Carnegie Mellon advisors David 
Hounshell, a professor of social and 
decision sciences, and Ed Rubin, a 
professor of engineering and public 
policy, to see what role the govern­
ment plays in technological change.
Their findings were recently cited 
on the journal Nature’s science news 
site, Nature Science Update
Van T. Dinh, a first-year business 
administration student at Drexel 
University in Philadelphia, was 
arrested on .Thursday for accessing 
someone else’s stock account and 
leaving him with a $40,000 loss.
Dinh allegedly lured visitors into 
installing his stock tracking software, 
which also included a hidden keylog- 
ging component. When users typed 
their stock portfolio passwords, they 
were logged and obtained by Dihn, 
who could then access that portfolio 
undetected.
Investigators have been tracking 
Dinh since July, following his elec­
tronic footprints and accumulating a 
mass of evidence directly incriminat­
ing him. Dinh was charged with secu­
rities fraud, mail and wire fraud, and 
damage due to unauthorized access 
to a computer. He is looking at a max­
imum of 20 years in prison for fraud 
and an additional maximum of ten 
years for the computer-related 
charges. Dinh had purchased 
$91,200 worth of “put” option con­
tracts from Cisco Systems, Inc., in 
June, which would have become val­
ueless if the stock did not drop to $15 
by July 19. Nearing his deadline and 
facing a huge loss, Dinh created an 
online scam to obtain access to other 
users’ accounts, and trace his options 
to those users. In this way, Dinh 
would have avoided $37,000 in loss­
es.

Sick computers now get 
house calls from RCCs
dents who have heavy desktop com­
puters. Now it is more convenient for 
both the students and our computing 
consultants to personally inspect and 
troubleshoot the problem.”
Junior ECE major Tanusree Datta 
is one of the residential computing 
consultants available to help stu­
dents out with their computer prob­
lems. “We usually help students out 
when they get viruses and help 
reconnect their computers back on 
the campus network after they are 
kicked off the network,” said Datta.
“We also hope to alleviate the 
computing problems that students 
face, especially during after hours 
when the Computing Help Center is 
closed,” said junior mechanical engi­
neering major Tyler Bowman, also 
an RCC. “This service is especially 
useful for students who are too busy 
during the day to get help due to 
their tight schedules. Basically, we 
bring the consultants to the stu­
dents.”
Lionel Maten, associate director of 
Housing Services, said he hopes that 
students will take advantage of the 
RCC program.
“It is a beneficial and highly con­
venient service for residents and an 
added benefit for all students,” said 
Maten.

from students for computing help in 
the students’ dorm rooms.
The RCC program began as a pilot

When they saw the success of the 
program, Computing Services decid­

“In the past, students usually had 
to bring their computers down to our

the problem, as the Help Center had

NetNotify that expedites the process 
of reconnecting students who had 
been kicked off the campus network.
“The process of reinstating a stu­
dent’s computer on the campus net­
work takes time, as it is usually done 
manually,” said Clay Fulton, manag­
er of the Computing Services Help
Center.
“Recently, we have been experi­
encing attacks by various worms and 
viruses, and as a result, a large num­
ber of students were kicked off the 
network,” he said.
Fulton said that once students 
make the necessary patches to their 
computers or get the help they need,
such as from the Help Center or the 
RCC, students can immediately 
inform the Help Center that their 
network access should be restored 
through the NetNotify website (net-

the reconnection proceeds much 
faster,” he said.

Economist Meltzer says job market not bad
Source: Associated Pressa small-business advocacy group, 
small businesses do in fact employ 
more workers than big businesses as 
a whole. These same small businesses 
created millions of jobs from 1993- 
98, when bigger companies were 
downsizing. More recently, a
market. In fact, the Labor 
Department reported recently that 
the economy lost another 93,000jobs 
last month in nearly every field, from 
manufacturing to services and gov­
ernment, despite evidence of a strong 
pickup in growth.
Still, the economy and the markets 
will eventually recover due to their 
cyclical nature, and with the power of 
the U.S. economy, this event may not 
be too far off.
“The U.S. economy is the strongest 
and most innovative in the world,” 
said CMU economics and EPP profes­
sor Lester Lave. “The current reces­
sion will be over in the next year or 
two and the U.S. economy will again 
provide the engine of growth for the 
world.”
Last Thursday at the 55th annual 
conference of the Pittsburgh Human 
Resources Association, Jeff Taylor, 
the founder of job search website 
Monster.com, predicted that a labor 
shortage is coming.
“Ultimately, you’re going to have to 
hire more people,” he told the HR 
professionals, according to the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Taylor bases his claims on the fact 
that a large number of baby boomers 
will soon be retiring, resulting in a 
substantial number of job openings. 
He predicts that these vacant jobs 
will counteract the continuing export 
of manufacturing and skilled jobs to 
India, China, and other countries 
overseas.
Taylor also predicts that the tech­
nology industry will come back as 
strong as ever. He suggests that much 
of the job growth in the future will 
come from entrepreneurs who will 
quickly grow their companies with 
the support of venture capitalists.
Stephen Spear, a Carnegie Mellon 
professor of economics, claims that 
the current economic conditions are 
relatively mild compared to the histo­
ry of major depressions in the U.S., 
albeit extended. This type of econom­
ic downturn, driven by new techno­
logical innovations, will eventually 
subside, according to Spear.
“The collapse of the dot-com bub­
ble has forced businesses to reac- 
quaint themselves with basic eco­
nomics, and to invest effort in under­
standing what their new information 
technologies can and can’t do before 
they invest further in the technology 
itself,” said Spear.

Pennsylvania environmental

With the help of student volun­

They will then sort the trash,

In the past few years, dot-com has 
almost become a dirty word. 
However, though no one questions 
whether or not the economy is in a 
slowdown, several economists have 
recently claimed that there is a dis­
connect between the panicky reac­
tions of the media and the actual 
health of the U.S. economy.
One of these economists is 
Carnegie Mellon professor of political 
economy and public policy Allan 
Meltzer, who presented the minority 
case in a recent opinion piece in the 
Wall Street Journal.
“Don’t believe ... the widely report­
ed loss of millions of manufacturing 
jobs since the Bush administration 
took office,” wrote Meltzer. “All these 
alleged facts are either wrong or 
greatly exaggerated, based on the 
same faulty source.”
When required 
to do a briefing 
for the Secretary 
Labor, 
Meltzer was 
struck by the
unusually ^ar§e
t discrepancies
between the 
government’s 
monthly report
Voolu meo98e, on unemploy­
ment and its 
report on payrolls. Upon further 
investigation and research, he con­
firmed his suspicion that the much- 
discussed loss of 2.7 million jobs 
since 2001 was an overstatement. 
The “household survey,” which gen­
erates the unemployment rate, 
showed only 220,000 fewer people 
employed since then.
Meltzer believes the household 
survey to be the more accurate of the 
two, since it is more likely to include 
small start-up companies and people 
who are self-employed. Based on this 
belief, Meltzer says recent reports of 
steady job losses are incorrect. As a 
result of his work, he has received the 
2003 Adam Smith Award for distin­
guished achievement in the field of 
business economics, the highest 
honor given by the National 
Association for Business Economics.
According to the National 
Federation of Independent Business,
Carnegie Mellon’s second annu­
al energy festival, EnergyFest 
2003, will be held in the University 
Center tomorrow from noon to 5 
pm.
Professionals from local compa­
nies and faculty from Carnegie 
Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh will speak in the 
Connan Room on such subjects as 
bio-diesel, fuel cells, and green 
roofs.
In Kirr and Wean Commons, 
there will be booths manned by 
state and local environmental 
organizations, as well as live music 
and refreshments.
“Last year’s EnergyFest sprang 
from the wind energy purchase in 
2001,” said Barbara Kviz, environ­
mental coordinator for Facilities 
Management Services (FMS).
In the spring of 2001, CMU 
made the largest purchase of wind 
energy in the United States.
The University bought five per­
cent of its total consumption from 
the Excelon-Community Energy 
Wind Farm.
Additionally, the Department of 
Energy declared October to be 
Energy Awareness Month and 
Pennsylvania declared the week of 
the festival to be Wind Energy 
Week.
It seemed appropriate that a fes­
tival be held during that week to 
encourage energy awareness 
across campus, said Brad 
Hochberg, the FMS energy manag­
er.
“The goal of the festival is to 
teach staff, students, and faculty 
how we consume energy, what we 
can do to conserve energy, and 
what the University is already 
doing to conserve,” said Hochberg.
To begin the festival, Pittsburgh 
Clean Cities will be presenting a 
$10,000 rebate check to FMS vice 
president Ken Kimbrough and 
CMU chief of police Creig Doyle for 
the University’s commitment to 
alternative fuel vehicles.
The check is equal to the differ­
ence in cost between purchasing
On Friday, German industrial con­
glomerate Siemens AG announced its 
intent to begin developing and pro­
ducing new high-precision radiation 
therapy for leukemia patients and 
children. The technology is believed 
to be capable of treating an addition­
al five to ten percent of currently 
untreatable cancers. The technology 
was developed by German physics 
research institute GSI along with the 
German Cancer Research Center and 
Heidelberg University.
Carbon-12 nuclei are fired from a 
particle accelerator at high speeds 
toward cancerous cells. These atoms 
are guided carefully using magnetic 
fields, thus lessening effects oh 
neighboring organs. The treatmen^ 
could be in hospitals in as little asr 
three years. Siemens still has legal- 
hurdles to jump and funding to 
obtain before being able to mass-pro­
duce these 35-million-dollar devices.
“Don’t believe... the 
widely reported 
loss of manufactur­
ing jobs since the 
Bush administra­
tion took office.”

Commerce Department gauge of the 
income of small-business owners and 
the self-employed, called “propri­
etors’ income,” has risen 8.4 percent 
in the past year, compared with a lag­
ging 1.4 percent growth in private 
wages and salaries.
Nonetheless, according to a recent 
study by Anthony Chan, chief econo­
mist at Banc One Investment 
Advisors, the household survey has 
never historically been a good indica­
tor of job growth. His research indi­
cated that in the first 21 months of 
economic recoveries since the 1950s, 
the payroll survey showed average 
job growth to be about 3.59 million, 
while the household survey showed 
job growth at just 3.09 million.
“In other words, the payroll survey 
usually does a better job of picking up 
a labor-market rebound,” Chan told 
CNN/Money. “This clearly shows that 
relying on the household survey’s 
employment measure as a barometer 
of labor market conditions is not only 
risky, but also an incorrect assump­
tion.”
The household survey showed a 
million-job increase in employment 
from December 2002 to January 
2003, which resulted only from the 
Labor Department’s accounting 
adjustments.
The surveys do, however, seem to 
reveal that recent job losses have not 
been quite as bad as reported in the 
past, and yet, there are very few signs 
of actual improvement in the job

Beijing needs 
more flu vaccine
Amidst its major efforts to control 
the SARS virus, Beijing is now facing 
a major lack of flu vaccine. The flu 
vaccine was widely used to distin­
guish SARS from the flu. Now, many 
individuals in Beijing who were pre­
viously diagnosed with SARS cannot 
receive treatment for their flu prob­

Beijing, a city with 14 million peo­
ple, only ordered 1.5 million doses of 
the vaccine, 4.5 million short of what 
the Beijing Center for Disease

THE TARTAN13 October 2003
FCC won’t let me be, trying to swear 
on NBC, U2’s Bono says follow me
there is no excuse for NBC’s lapse. Editing 
Bono’s statement to be in better taste would 
not have changed the content at all. Bono 
still gets his point across if the audience 
hears him say “This is really, really, bril­
liant.”
The standard free-speech-crusader’s cry 
against censorship does not fly here since 
the meaning of Bono’s brilliant sentence 
does not change. Censorship and editing are 
two different things. Taking out unneces­
sary adjectives is editing.
But according to the FCC, context super­
sedes all other considerations. Their ruling 
states that Bono’s remark “may be crude 
and offensive, but, in the context presented 
here, did not describe sexual or excretory 
organs or activities.” Therefore, what Bono 
said is not “indecent.”
Granted, Bono’s word choice was meant 
in a positive way. But how far does this prin­
ciple go? The ruling implies that anything 
goes as long as it is meant in a positive or 
non-sexual way.
Tragically, Bono’s comment does truly 
comply with the letter of the law. The sad­
dest part of this mess is that the FCC had to 
issue a ruling confirming this. Indecency 
laws are meant to prevent people from get­
ting offended.
Americans expect, when watching net­
work television, alone or more importantly 
with their children, that a certain standard 
of language will be upheld.
Even if Bono’s use of the word does com­
ply with the letter of the law, it does not 
comply with the spirit if the FCC has to split 
hairs between being “crude” and “offen­
sive,” but not “indecent.”
This mishap represents one of those 
loathsome yet inevitable times when laws, 
however carefully written, fail to serve their 
purpose. Then again, it takes a real bunch of 
uptight old conservative hacks to spend 
thousands of dollars to prosecute an episode 
better just left forgotten.
You know the world is changing when the 
FCC says it is okay to use the f-word on 
'national primetime television. Last January, 
,Jat the Golden Globe awards, U2 lead singer 
¦Bono uttered the phrase “This is really, real­
ly fucking brilliant.” NBC broadcasted this 
flattering expression across the nation.
Predictably, a few conservative groups, 
including the Parents Television Council, 
filed a complaint with the FCC saying that 
NBC should be fined for violating decency 
laws.
In their typical bureaucratic lethargy, the 
FCC finally ruled October 3, that the remark 
did not violate decency laws and NBC would 
not be fined.
: Bono should have known to keep his lan- 
,guage in check at the Golden Globe Awards; 
however, NBC is primarily at fault for not 
editing out the curse, as they must follow 
FCC guidelines that they agree to in order to 
operate.
Nearly all live broadcasts have a lag of 
several seconds that, among other things, 
allows material to be edited or muted. 
Networks have an interest in keeping pro­
gramming compliant with the law and not 
offensive to viewers. They should anticipate 
formal complaints by groups like the 
Parents Television Council and not risk get­
ting slapped with a fine, not to mention the 
bad press that comes with it. Editing out 
r such colorful metaphors as that which Bono 
used during the Golden Globe Awards 
should be standard procedure, no matter 
what the context, essentially because this is 
the law.
It is also the safest and most sensible 
action one can take to avoid fines.
However, given the importance of the 
Golden Globe Awards and the large audi­
ence, it is necessary to assume that NBC 
made a deliberate decision not to follow this 
policy and instead allowBono’s words to air 
unaltered.
Common sense is not the only reason that

Affirmative action still 
necessary in football
In the October 6 Tartan, Colin Holloway 
uses the occasion of Rush Limbaugh’s bigot­
ed comments about Philadelphia Eagles 
quarterback Donovan McNabb to take his 
own swipe at affirmative action in sports.
He argues that “the [NFL] needs to ... 
admit that that teams hire the best coaches 
for the job, regardless of race, no matter 
which color winds up on top.”
Needless to say, this assertion is incredi­
bly naive. Let’s take just one example, that 
of Marvin Lewis. He was the brilliant defen­
sive coordinator for the 2000 Sup6r Bowl 
champion Baltimore Ravens.
Their defense was widely acknowledged 
as being the best in the history of the.NFL. 
That year, there were nine head coaching 
vacancies in the league. Out of these nine 
positions, Lewis was offered only one job 
interview, and no job.
I have to ask: what would have happened 
if Lewis were white?
After all, there are countless white candi­
dates without Lewis’ track record and 
strong references who get NFL head coach­
ing jobs year after year. Lewis finally did get 
a position two years later with the 
Cincinnati Bengals, perennially the worst 
team in football.
Affirmative action exists specifically 
because we don’t trust the people who are 
making these hiring decisions to make them 
in a color-blind way.
Moreover, the tepid variant of affirmative 
action that exists in the NFL today does lit­
tle more than shame those involved. In the 
same column, we hear the claim that “Steve 
Mariucci is ten times the coach of any black 
coach I can think of.” (Reminder: Steve 
Mariucci is the guy who was recently fired 
as head coach of the 49ers.)
Well, how may black head coaches can 
you think of, Colin? After all, there are cur­
rently only 3 in the NFL, while in the entire 
history of Division I college football, there 
have only been 20. Today, there are only
five black head coaches in Division I (4.3 
percent of the total), even though 47 per­
cent of the players are black.
It seems that affirmative action is a 
favorite target of the right these days, if not 
for many liberals as well. It’s a shame, 
because color-blind decisions are not being 
made in college or pro football when it 
comes to coaches or management. 
Moreover, everything I’ve seen and heard in 
my professional experience confirms that 
this is true in the corporate world as well.

Greek philanthropy 
benefits community
together for a relaxing and enjoyable after­
noon.
Yes, it is true that Student Senate mone­
tarily helped us to put on this event. It 
should also be noted that their contribution 
to our celebration enabled us to give all pro­
ceeds to Children’s Hospital while thanking 
the community for their efforts in our fund­
raising endeavor. From our perspective, tjiis 
hardly seems unreasonable or ridiculous?.
As for the actual event, it is a celebration 
for all involved, not only the members' of 
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa DeltaUho, 
but for those on campus who supported the 
Free Care Fund. The idea behind this day is 
to bring the community together and show 
our gratitude for helping with such a noble 
cause. It also encourages involvement and 
participation from those just passing by 
wanting some food and subsequently 
donating a few extra dollars. The celebra­
tion is justifiable, both as a fun, carefree 
event for any student to participate in and 
as a philanthropic event serving to aid a 
notable charity. We have raised approxi­
mately $4000 from this event, and we are 
still receiving donations from other spon­
sors. For this amount to be scoffed at is triv­
ializing the substantial effort and support of 
many individuals. Every donation helps to 
sustain this amazing frmd, including the 
$12,000 that Kappa Kappa Gamma and 
Kappa Delta Rho have raised over the past 
three years.
The purpose of this event was not to infu­
riate or waste money, but rather for campus 
fun and to give back to those less fortunate. 
We hope that our aim was made clear and 
that we will be able to continue this event 
for many more years. We would like to take 
this time to thank everyone that was 
involved in making QMQ a success. We also 
hope that now the positive effects of QMQ 
are seen not only for Children’s Hospital, 
but also for the Carnegie Mellon and 
Pittsburgh community as a whole.
Tolerance abides at CMU, so CMU : 
grant tolerable housing to students
The sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma and 
the brothers of Kappa Delta Rho would like 
to express their thoughts and respond to Mr. 
Johnson’s article “I want my quarter back” 
concerning the presumed lack of participa­
tion and apparent lack of need for the phil­
anthropy event Quarter Mile of Quarters 
(QMQ).
The purpose of QMQ is to encourage phil­
anthropy. The sisters of Kappa Kappa 
Gamma and the brothers of Kappa Delta 
Rho work very hard to organize QMQ and 
raise money for a deserving charity. All pro­
ceeds from this event are given to Children’s 
Hospital of Pittsburgh, specifically aiding 
the Free Care Fund. This fund pledges that 
no child should go without medical atten­
tion if they need it, regardless of their abili­
ty to pay. In order for us to raise money for 
this cause, we need the support of other 
organizations and the community as a 
whole. Numerous businesses in the 
Monroeville, Squirrel Hill, Shadyside and 
Waterfront districts donated raffle prizes 
that raised money for the Children’s 
Hospital fund. Student Senate recognized 
this as an opportunity to not only raise 
awareness about a worthy cause, but also as 
a chance to bring the CMU community
The healthy environment at CMU has 
been achieved through a diyerse confluence 
of views combined with respect and toler­
ance that are readily adopted by members of 
the campus community.
What the University can still do though is 
make the move to offer coed living spaces. 
Just as we recognize the discomfort in living 
with someone of the opposite sex for het­
erosexual people, so must we recognize the 
same discomfort that can affect GLBT indi­
viduals, and their straight roommates.
Carnegie Mellon has already put the good 
foot forward in offering unisex bathrooms 
in some of its buildings, but the residence 
hall progress lags behind the other progres­
sive attitudes of the institution. This may 
also be a step in an even more progressive 
direction, beating down preconceived gen­
der roles and inequalities.
This month, CMU and the other progres­
sive bodies and individuals in this country 
celebrate Gay Pride month. While the tok- 
enizing of cultural diversity by assigning it a 
monthly allotment is trivial, CMU’s eager 
recognition and participation testifies to the 
positive environment on campus that all 
cultural identity groups represented here 
enjoy.
When each of us leaves CMU, we will find 
the outside world less progressive.
Now is the time, if you do not already, to 
speak up if you hear an errant slur. Now is 
the time to write a public official who 
speaks poorly of gays or stands in the way of 
equality by refusing to grant same-sex part­
ners the rights given to their straight coun­
terparts. The world is slowly progressing 
towards the attitudes exemplified by the 
CMU community, but we should do every­
thing in our power to hasten the enlighten­
ment.
’ No sane politician will take the podium 
these days and make negative references
* about blacks or Hispanics, no matter the 
context. Unfortunately, we still live in an era 
when many public officials, including the 
president of the United States, uphold anti­
gay sentiments.
War Just down the street, the University of 
Pittsburgh, a state institution, refuses to 
grant same sex benefits to couples that 
would be married save for the status quo 
thinking that plagues our government.
In some matters, it seems that the atti­
tudes of the state have yet to catch up with 
the attitudes of those it governs. The state 
j <>hould look to Carnegie Mellon as model of 
the tolerance and respect which they lack.
Carnegie Mellon provides a supportive 
environment for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and 
transgender (GLBT) students, faculty, and 
staff. In addition to the fact that CMU does 
bestow same-sex benefits to its employees, 
the University has a plethora of GLBT 
employees and students that attests to the 
permeation of tolerance and even approval 
the community.
. For example, the University sponsors a 
"reception for GLBT students each fall. Hunt 
MLibrary has many studies on GLBT in video 
and text form, and the sexual orientation 
health office (S0H0) is Carnegie Mellon’s 
resource center for GLBT concerns. Through 
; the Division of Student Affairs, the 
University also offers Safezone — an initia­
tive dedicated to preserving the positive 
environment GLBT students enjoy.
While University policies, organizations, 
and administrative support are significant, 
it is the people of the community that make 
Carnegie Mellon the supportive and safe 
environment that every community should 
strive for.
Sincerely,
The sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma and 
the brothers of Kappa Delta Rho
Get retro, judges: Thou shalt not kill
this should serve as a breath of fresh air.
The argument against making the 1988 
case retroactive revolves around the prose­
cutor’s arguments that the families of 
Banks’ victims and other Pennsylvania fam­
ilies might not receive closure. This princi­
ple of closure is the same ridiculous princi­
ple that keeps images of the twin towers off 
the air post-September 11. Somehow the 
soft psychological buzzwords have woven 
themselves into our societal fabric. Studies 
have been undertaken showing that some­
times, the psychological effects of having a 
criminal put to death are harsher on the 
often emotionally frail psyches of the vic­
tims’ families. The desire for revenge may 
cause families to argue in favor of “an eye 
for an eye,” but often times the high cost, as 
well as long process of appeals before even 
the potential of a capital punishment arises, 
can be more taxing on the family. Years are 
spent in the courtroom when the prisoner 
could be forced to rot for the remainder of 
his natural life in a dirty, filthy prison cell, 
with dirty, filthy people.
Is this writer against the death penalty? 
Of course. There are many planks that sup­
port this argument, so here is some focus. I 
am against putting any innocent man to 
death at any point, in any case. I am espe­
cially against the slim possibility of this hap­
pening in a country that prides itself on 
being based on a system of laws. Recently, 
while in New York City’s southern 
Manhattan “village,” I attended a show 
called The Exonerated. This show took 6 or 7 
real cases of people wrongly convicted of 
murder, and explained them fully. In some 
of the cases, persons were actually executed 
before finally being exonerated. To many, 
myself included, this is simply inexcusable. 
Perhaps, if these souls had been afforded 
life sentences and continued their fights to 
be set free, they may have been living still 
when finally exonerated. Again, killing an 
innocent man for any reason, even as one of 
the “occasional” flaws in a system, is always 
inappropriate, and somewhat barbaric.
Another argument presented here against
the death penalty is the wonderfully conser­
vative argument of basic economics. It costs 
more to attempt to sentence someone to 
death than it costs to sentence him to life in 
prison. A Duke University study states that 
the death penalty costs North Carolina 
“$2.16 million per execution over the costs 
of a non-death penalty murder case with a 
sentence of imprisonment for life” (Terry 
Sanford Institute of Public Policy, $uke 
University). Other studies done in fexas 
show it costs roughly $1.6 million mo'f^to 
go through the process of putting som&6he 
to death than to keep him in a maximum- 
security prison for 40 years. These base eco­
nomic figures, combined with the fact that 
many modern studies show that there isino 
deterrent effect associated with the death 
penalty, make a strong case against, ihe 
death penalty. These arguments are deftVed 
from a less emotional, and more objective 
basis.
Compound that the death penalty is a 
somewhat “easy” way for someone to be 
punished. I believe that the years of psycho­
logical torture, and the occasional unwant­
ed sodomy, are far worse than a lethal injec­
tion. The “closure” might not be there for 
families immediately, but after years of 
being able to live their daily lives without 
hearing of, or having to participate in, 
appeals, they can begin to let go and move 
on with their lives. Meanwhile, the murder­
er still suffers for the duration of his or her 
natural life. These points all have a connec­
tion to the Pennsylvania case currently 
under review by the U.S. Supreme Court. If 
even the minor flaws cited in this case are 
grounds for overturning a death sentence, 
imagine what other changes to the system 
are required when examined under the 
influence of the other horrible potential 
consequences of continuing on this custom.
Ben flackett
Last week, the Supreme Court convened 
for the beginning of its 2003-04 term. There 
are many important and precedent-setting 
cases on the docket waiting to be heard. 
Some of these cases also have implications 
for the state of Pennsylvania. Although 
there are a couple of cases on the docket 
that may shake up Pennsylvania politics, 
this examination goes to a case dealing with 
the death penalty. In this case the justices 
will eventually decide whether or not to 
make a decision setting standards for jury 
instructions in death-penalty cases retroac­
tive. This ruling could make a difference in 
the sentences of 30 inmates currently on 
Pennsylvania’s death row.
The case arises out of an appeal by the 
commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the 
district attorney of Luzere County. The 
appeal surrounds a 20-year-old case in 
which George E. Banks was convicted of 
killing 13 people, and was subsequently 
sentenced to death. While guilty, the issue 
surrounding the case was that the jury 
instructions at his sentencing in 1983 
clashed with rules laid down by the 
Supreme Court in a 1988 decision. Thus if 
the case was successful in making the deci­
sion retroactive, George E. Banks would be 
re-sentenced, with the possibility of getting 
life in prison instead of the death penalty.
Now normally, this pen would be scream­
ing down the page about how ridiculous a 
retroactive ruling is, agreeing with the nor­
mal situation where cases seeking to make 
issues retroactive are thrown away. 
However, this time the added spotlight onto 
a capital case serves as a wonderful political 
platform to argue against the death penalty.
Regular readers and “agree-ers”, I apolo­
gize in advance for what might seem like a 
blindside attack on the typical principles 
championed here. Typical “disagree-ers”,

Dean a shoe-in for Democratic candidate 3oteg FBL
Michael Croland
Howard Dean seems destined to win both the 
. JDemocratic primary and the presidential election. 
'^Through his personal strengths and his opponents’ 
¦Xvittuggles, all roads lead to Dean.
££SPean> the former governor of Vermont, presents
* ^widely appealing balance of political ideologies. 
>«'This middle ground is an acceptable compromise 
~^for many voters with disparate political perspec- 
^ fives, so long as it provides a way to defeat Bush. 
^*"Some of Dean’s policies, ranging from econom­
ist! t0 gun control, are arguably conservative. He
been embraced by legions of progressives, 
‘^though, for leading the criticism of Bush and the 
. ££5q war.
;^f^‘[We] on the left can’t [complain] about this 
:'^guy being too moderate, because he’s a good old- 
»'^shioned pro-choice, pro-education, anti-war 
of Democrat,” endorsed the radically pro- 
^grgssive web site PunkVoter.com. Dean might not 
—fee an absolute liberal, but he still connects well 
¦¦"with progressives.
^3)ean’s popularity has mounted immensely in 
Sjs&cent months. In June, he won an unprecedented 
*33ine Democrat primary, hosted by the liberal 
MoveOn.org, by a landslide. In August, he 
. ^tnade the front-covers of Time, Newsweek, and U.S. 
News & World Report, all in the same week.
-«»«His fundraising has surpassed his opponents, 
•Saving collected by far the most funds for a candi­
date in both of the last two fiscal quarters. He’s 
-Jt&ken the lead in most polls, including those in the 
influential primary states of Iowa and New 
Q "Hampshire.
• 1rAt the heart of Dean’s success lies an effort to 
connect with voters and “take our country back.”
'u Much of this revolves around masterful use of the 
^Internet. Through the World Wide Web, his cam- 
L.,psugn has set up everything from an official cam­
paign blog to grassroots a organization through 
MeetUp.com.
mr-t^There are over 120,000 Dean aficionados 
•> signed up through MeetUp.com; Gen. Wesley
Clark, with over 37,000 sign-ups, is the candidate 
with the next largest following. Across the coun­
try, Dean supporters write letters to fellow 
Democrats at monthly meetings and affirm a 
strong patriotic community to replace the Bush 
status quo.
The failures of Bush, rival parties, and fellow 
Democrats have all contributed to Dean’s surge of 
success, which will increase so long as those with 
whom he is contrasted continue to struggle.
Bush is the ultimate challenge of the eventual 
Democratic candidate, but overcoming him might 
be anticlimactic following the primaries. The U.S. 
has lost more troops in Iraq since the major com­
bat portion of the war ended. Bush's decrying of 
Cuba last week will likely lead to unnecessarily 
higher tension with our island neighbor. Like our 
economy, Bush’s approval ratings are sinking.
Many Americans are frustrated with “the way 
things are going,” as Dean remarked following last
Annalisa Schaefer/Art Staff
week’s California election that recalled Governor 
Gray Davis.
“Come next November, that anger might be 
directed at a different incumbent... in the White 
House.”
The history books will remember Bush as a one- 
term president.
Democratic candidate A1 Gore was kept from 
victory in 2000 partially because many progres­
sive voters supported Green Party candidate Ralph 
Nader. With the Green Party’s current disorgani­
zation, any candidate they run will not significant­
ly lessen the Democratic candidate’s support base.
The Green Party held its national convention in 
July; agendas ranged from not running any candi­
date to supporting Democratic candidate 
Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio). Nader 
remains surprisingly silent about launching

, rt^ast weekend, I went to a 
/Tf^diohead concert. If you like 
^Radiohead, you understand why 
’^tiiat’s a big deal. If you really like 
uft.adiohead, then you’ll understand 
vtilk frustrating it was to see a guy a
Marina Kliger/Art Staff
couple of rows in front of me holding 
up a crummy eight-and-a-half by 11 
inch sheet of paper, on which he had 
written in Sharpie: “CREEP.”
Thom Yorke would not be amused. 
Obviously, the guy wanted 
Radiohead to bust out with the 
chart-topper from their 1992 debut 
album Pablo Honey. A good song, a 
good album: the guy had decent 
taste. But what bothered me — and 
what would have bothered any hard­
core Radio-Head — was the fact that 
this guy really didn’t know anything 
about the band.
If he were a true fan, he would 
have known that Radiohead refuses 
to play “Creep” live. They hate the 
song, because it pigeonholed them 
as generic early-‘90s alt-rock; in fact, 
they wrote another song, “My Iron 
Lung,” condemning the shallow 
fame that the earlier single had won 
them.
The guy at the concert meant well, 
I’m sure, or he wouldn’t have come 
to the concert, and wouldn’t have 
had such good seats for such a 
packed show. Still, he’s the kind of 
guy that devout fans hate, the kind 
of guy who doesn’t take the time to 
do his research and immerse himself 
in the band. He brings out the worst 
in people like me, and makes us 
greedy, jealous defenders of “our” 
artists.
If you’re passionate about some­
thing — a band, an author, maybe 
even a movie or TV show — you 
probably know the feeling. You think 
that no one could possibly under­
stand the depth of your adoration, 
the sincerity and fervor that fills you 
with each successive chorus or chap­
ter.
You assume that all other fans are 
posers, and that you are the only one 
who really understands the art. You 
want to claim your artists. They’re 
yours.
In addition to Radiohead, I have a 
few other favorites of whom I’m very 
protective. I hate lending out my J.D. 
Salinger books, and I can’t stand to 
even talk to anyone about the 
Beatles, lest I have to listen to their 
uninformed and half-witted opin­
ions.
“I really like that song, what’s it 
called ... ‘All You Need Is Love?’”
In high school, when I worked in a 
record store, I used to cringe every
time someone asked for just another 
Top 40 hit and, every time they 
asked me “What’s good?” These peo­
ple were the casual radio listeners 
who gobbled up every computer-pol­
ished Britney single that came their 
way, and I couldn’t understand their 
lack of enthusiasm for their music; 
but at the same time, if these people 
moved in on my territory, I’d hate 
them even more.
It’s such a selfish sentiment, and 
it’s so vain of me to think that I 
should be the only one entitled to a 
certain band or author. But imagine 
if your dad were to take the girl next 
door to the hypothetical father- 
daughter picnic. That’s the same 
kind of violation a Radiohead fan 
might feel upon seeing a crummy 
eight-and-a-half by 11-inch sheet of 
paper, on which someone had writ­
ten in Sharpie: “CREEP.”
So many of us, then, think that 
John Lennon is singing only to us. 
We all have these private fantasies — 
and, I think, deservedly so. It might 
be a narcissistic delusion, but it’s 
that special connection that makes 
the music so important. We bind our­
selves to every note and every page, 
and each one of us deserves the sole 
title of Super-Fan. Maybe we should 
all keep quiet about it, though, and 
save ourselves from unattractive 
arrogance by silently believing that 
we have claimed our art.
So Radiohead is mine. J.D. 
Salinger is mine. The Beatles are all 
mine.
And a million other fans are prob­
ably thinking the same thing.

Republicans in one of our nation’s 
largest states have recently been 
using dirty political tactics to abuse 
democracy and strengthen their hold 
on power. No, I’m not talking about 
California. Amidst all the recall may­
hem, little attention has been given to 
another political story with bigger 
national implications. The setting is 
the Texas legislature, home of George 
W. Bush-style “bipartisanship,” where 
working together for the Republicans 
apparently means using one party’s 
grip on power to violate minority vot­
ing rights, separating the distinction 
between executive and legislative 
powers, causing legislative gridlock, 
and using any and all means short of 
winning votes to gain a permanent 
majority in the United States House 
of Representatives.
This saga, which has critics com­
paring Texas to a banana republic, 
started in the 2001 session of the 
Texas legislature, when it was sup­
posed to redraw both its 
Congressional and legislative voting 
maps following the 2000 national 
census in order to ensure that each 
one had an equal number of voters. 
The Congressional map affects the 
state’s delegates to the U.S. House of 
Representatives, and the legislative 
map affects the makeup of the state’s 
government.
A Congressional redistricting plan 
passed the Democrat-controlled state 
legislature, but nothing ever emerged 
from committee in the state senate, 
where the Republicans controlled a 
slim majority and rules designed to 
encourage bipartisanship required a 
2/3 majority to bring matters to a 
vote. As the state government did not 
fulfill its Constitutional obligation to 
draw a map, the matter was referred 
to court, and a Congressional map 
was drawn by a three-judge panel, 
which used a “least change” approach 
to protect the status quo and stay out 
of partisan politics.
Meanwhile, a Republican-con­
trolled Legislative Redistricting 
Board redrew the state’s legislative 
maps in 2002, and Republicans 
gained majorities in the state legisla­
ture for the first time since 
Reconstruction.
On a national front, despite 20 of 
the 32 Congressional districts’ being 
solidly Republican or leaning towards 
it, several moderate-to-conservative 
Democrats who were popular even 
among their independent and 
Republican constituents were reelect­
ed, and the national Texas delegation 
to the House of Representatives con­
tained 17 Democrats to 15 
Republicans.
Unhappy that they couldn’t win the 
votes to unseat these popularly elect­
ed officials, and prodded by 
Washington Republicans such as Tom 
DeLay, who has been quoted as say­
ing “I’m the majority leader, and we 
want more seats,” state Republicans 
decided to strong-arm a new redis­
tricting bill through government, 
courtesy of their newfound majority 
in the legislature and stronger major­
ity in the state senate. The U.S. 
Constitution only allows for redis­
tricting every ten years, -but the 
Republicans, who had contributed to 
the failure to draw a Congressional 
map, claimed that the court-drawn 
map was only valid until the legisla-

All roads lead to Howard Dean
DEAN, from page A7
another bid for the presidency, and it 
seems that the Green Party will not 
have much of a stake in the next pres­
idential election.
I Kucinich has hit home with some 
progressives, but he and fellow liber­
al candidates Reverend Al Sharpton 
and Senator Carol Moseley Braun (D- 
illi) have been too radical to do so 
substantially. Not too long into the 
primary season, if not sooner, these 
candidates will all fold.
! Their exit path from the primary 
tace has already been dug by Senator 
Bob Graham (D-Fla.), who last week 
became the first candidate among 
the 10 to drop out.
! Many Dean enthusiasts viewed 
Graham as a decent and non-threat- 
pning alternative to Dean. They 
pxpect Graham’s relatively few sup­
porters to rally behind Dean.
I Clark was a late-comer to the 
crowded field last month, and the 
novice politico suffers from inexperi­
ence. His campaign manager, Donnie 
Fowler, resigned last week due to 
internal rifts in the campaign. Clark
has been popular in the press, but has 
greatly amorphous platforms. Clark’s 
current presence in the race hurts 
former frontrunner Senator John 
Kerry (D-Mass.). Kerry previously 
stood out due to his military experi­
ence, which now pales in comparison 
to Clark’s. This contrast will lead 
enthusiasm for Kerry to decline; he 
will not endanger Dean’s chances of 
winning.
Clark has been in talks with Dean 
on numerous occasions about joining 
the Dean ticket. Once Kerry no longer 
stands out, Clark will hopefully sur­
render his campaign and bolster 
Dean’s candidacy, as either vice pres­
ident or secretary of state. He’s not 
necessarily best suited for those jobs 
either, chiefly because of his political 
naivete. However, this option allows 
for not worrying about the Clark fac­
tor and returning to realistic opti­
mism that favors Dean.
Senator Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) 
and Representative Dick Gephardt 
(D-Mo.) have criticized Dean for his 
stances pertaining to Israel and 
Medicare, respectively. Gephardt was 
misinformed about Dean’s stance on
the latter issue, and such criticism 
only shows how desperate the under­
achievers are becoming. Their verbal 
assaults haven’t substantially harmed 
Dean.
The only other candidate is 
Senator John Edwards (D-N.C.). Like 
Kerry and Gephardt, he has a sizeable 
following and still stands a decent 
shot at beating Dean. However, all 
three of these candidates don’t zing 
audiences as unique or worth caring 
about. Although qualified for the job, 
they lack the pizzazz to win over vot­
ers.
As is apparent across the nation, 
Dean does have the necessary piz­
zazz and politics to captivate 
Americans. Benefiting from his mag­
nificent campaign and the troubles of 
his opponents, Dean is deservingly 
the front-runner to take on and 
defeat Bush.

Texas Republicans’ dirty tricks
TRICKS, from page A7
ture drew a map, giving them the right to draw a map 
themselves.
The Republican-proposed maps would give them up to 
22 Congressional seats by packing as many minority and 
Democratic voters into as few districts as possible, split­
ting up rural districts in order to dilute the influence of 
independent Republicans.
Doing this would almost certainly assure Republicans a 
majority in the House of Representatives through 2010, 
the next time redistricting is supposed to occur. The pro­
posed Republican map used such creative methods of 
diluting Democratic votes that nationally syndicated 
columnist Molly Ivans called it “a Dadaist masterpiece, 
with elements of Picasso.”
-When it became apparent to Democrats last May that 
Republicans were about to force through a redistricting 
bill that would take away the voting influence of many 
minority voters, possibly violating the Voting Rights Act, 
House Democrats fled to Oklahoma as a last resort, 
depriving the House of a quorum. At this point, 
Republicans ordered state troopers to arrest Democratic 
members and bring them to the House, and Tom DeLay 
said that he “consulted an attorney in his office to deter­
mine for the Texas House speaker whether FBI agents and 
U.S. marshals could be used to arrest the Democrats.” 
Indeed, the Department of Homeland Security was some­
how involved, but before evidence of illegitimate use of 
law enforcement could be turned up, according to the 
Star Telegram, the “Texas Department of Public Safety 
ordered the destruction of all records and photos gath­
ered in the search.”
^Eventually, the Democrats relented, having assured 
themselves that the longstanding 2/3 majority rule in the 
Senate would allow Democrats there to block the mea­
sure, and so a redistricting bill was passed in the House. 
However, the longstanding tradition of a 2/3 rule was 
something agreed upon at the beginning of each session, 
sq it was not set in stone.
’Republican Governor Rick Perry decided to call a spe­
cial session of the Senate, and after being thwarted in the 
session by the Democratic minority’s use of the 2/3 rule, 
h£ and the President of the Senate decided to suspend the 
riile.
; Democrats were tipped off about this, and 11 of the 12 
fled to Arizona to deprive the Senate of a quorum. 
Meanwhile, Republicans fined them up to $5000 a day, 
afld took away parking privileges and some funding for 
tiieir staffers. After boycotting the second special session, 
m •of the Democrats in exile decided that he had no
choice but to return to Texas, given all the other issues 
that were going unresolved, and seeing no way out of the 
political warfare between the two sides. This gave the 
Senate a quorum again.
This brings us to'where we are now. Since September, 
the Texas legislature has been in its third special session. 
You’d think that the first two special sessions would have 
given them enough time to finish working on a map, but 
instead, they’ve spent the last month quibbling over the 
details.
Still, DeLay last week spent three days trying to get the 
House and Senate to reconcile their differences, and they 
think a map is almost complete — one which an analyst 
for the Republicans stated “is the most aggressive map I 
have ever seen.... This has a real national impact that 
should assure that Republicans keep the House no matter 
the national mood.”
Some Democrats charge that along with the impeach­
ment of Bill Clinton, the Florida police barriers and 
recounts in the 2000 election, the California recall, and 
similar partisan redistricting efforts in Colorado and 
Ohio, this signals an all-out war by the Republicans to 
take away the power from the voters and give it to them­
selves.
Personally, I see it simply as an act that further erodes 
democracy in this country, an act that should be con­
demned by members of any political party. Republican 
apologists might argue that Democrats would do the same 
thing — and while gerrymandering has indeed been prac­
ticed by both political parties, the case in Texas is far more 
extreme than in past cases, and far more significant, as 
the United States is now threatened with a period of one- 
party rule. Also, the prospect of redistricting in an off-year 
leads to the frightening prospect of perpetual all-out polit­
ical warfare that prevents anything from ever getting 
done.
This also highlights a misplacement of priority by vot­
ers. While partisan redistricting and other political tactics 
are often condemned by the people often out of power, 
they are often condoned by those in power, who believe 
that the end justifies the means.
The end does not justify the means, and voters must 
make fair elections a higher priority. They must tell their 
politicians to act fairly and vote them out otherwise — 
even if they’re members of the same party. I also recom­
mend citizens to tell their officials to support bipartisan or 
nonpartisan redistricting boards the next time it’s time to 
redraw the maps.

IM Flag Football
It was an exciting night for flag 
football last Thursday, when teams 
from all four leagues participated in 
the championships.
The minors game offered a bloody 
battle between Spirit Won’t Stop and 
KDR Quad North-B. Spirit won 
13-12 in a close game that was 
clearly very reflective of the score.
The match between KDR Twin R.B 
and Fuzzy Wuzzies was the only 
match of the four to extend beyond 
regulation. Upon retaining the ball 
in overtime, KDR capitalized by 
scoring on their first drive, and won 
26-20.
In the women’s league, the game 
was a knee-scraping thriller 
between members of the Tartan bas­
ketball team, as Hoopers B defeated 
Hoopers A, 24—21. Hoopers B scored 
on the last play of the game with no 
time left to defeat their teammates.
Perhaps the most emotional game 
of the night was the majors, which
featured the Beta Eagles and The 
Untouchables de Beta. Junior 
Untouchables quarterback and team 
founder Michael Divens was missing 
from action with an ankle injury, 
though he was perhaps equally 
effective as head coach for 
Thursday’s duel. The Beta Eagles 
won the game 19-18 in a battle that 
provided many missed extra point 
attempts. Scoring with only two sec­
onds remaining, the Untouchables 
cut the lead to 1, facing the predica­
ment of going for the tie with the 
extra point, or the victory with the 
two point conversion. Divens kept 
the field goal unit on the sideline 
and waved to newfound senior quar­
terback Nick Miller to attempt the 
two-pointer. The third conversion 
had the same result as the prior two 
for the Untouchables, as they missed 
for a third time and lost the game. 
“On that night, they were the better 
team,” said Divens following the 
game at a press conference.
Golf
Despite having only played in 
three tournaments this year, the 
Tartans have faired well thus far. 
Their biggest and most recent tour­
nament was last Tuesday at the 
Allegheny Invitational. The Tartans
placed second out of ten teams at 
the event, finishing with a four-man 
team score of 315. Sophomore Matt 
Simone individually finished second 
in the tournament with a 75, while 
junior Jeremy Stone and first-year 
Ben Warren each shot a 78, tying for 
fifth overall.
At every tournament, five golfers 
from the eight-man roster play, and 
the top four scores are combined 
into the total team score. Coach Rich 
Erdelyi plans to use the five same 
golfers Monday at the Westminster 
Invitational as he did last Tuesday in 
Meadville, due to their spectacular 
performance.
Although there are no conference 
tournaments during the regular sea­
son, the team’s ultimate goal is to 
win the UAA championship, a tour­
nament which does not occur until 
April. Should the Tartans continual­
ly repeat such performances in their 
invitationals as they did in 
Meadville, that goal will be kept 
very much in check.
An additional aspect of the Tartan 
golf team is their performance in the 
classroom. The team grade point 
average is 3.62, highest among all 
CMU varsity teams.

They are trying to build them­

that nerdy kid on MTVs MADE, they 
are trying too hard to be something 
they aren’t. Bengals people have a 
group of people who get along well 
with them, but always set their 
sights too high when it comes to dat­
ing. Bengals work well with: other 
Bengals, or free Internet porn.
Due to space constraints these aré 
all the teams I’m able to analyze, but 
that should be enough to get the 
idea. Maybe I can find a Bengal per­
son to set up a website for me so I 
can actually do this whole thing 
online. Either way, now you can’t say 
football is just for sports fans; every­
one has a little NFL inside them. 
Anyway, look for the Rams to get

night in St. Louis, and have a good

Who’s dating 
whom: NFL 
couple guide
Mgsye 1gssgkHu
Last Monday night was a tough 
one for this old sports columnist. I 
watched as the most heralded D in 
the NFL, the one I picked to hoist the 
Lombardi Trophy, got shredded by 
perennial choker Payton Manning 
and his typically under-achieving 
Colts. Manning was brilliant, for one 
quarter. He led a six-minute, 21- 
point rally in the fourth quarter, 
allowing his team to win the game in 
overtime against the defending 
champs and the toughest defense in 
football. It was thrilling. Last week, 
the Carolina Panthers continued 
their amazing undefeated run, and 
the Green Bay Packers welcomed 
Mike Holmgren back with a trounc­
ing of his Seahawks. It was an excit­
ing week in the NFL, and this one 
promises to be even better. While the 
Colts and Panthers meet up in a bat­
tle of unbeaten teams, Tampa Bay 
meets another high-powered offense 
when Washington comes to town, 
and the Niners can make another 
push for NFC West respect when 
they visit Seattle.
Yet still, people insist that football 
is boring. Perhaps they are just not 
sports fans. Perhaps the game is too 
complicated for them. Whatever the 
reason, it’s time to make the game 
easy for them to relate to by compar­
ing it to an aspect of our everyday 
lives: dating.
There are countless sites on the 
Internet that match your dating per­
sonality to cartoon characters, pop 
icons, even foods. While all of these 
sites are complete BS, people seem to 
really get into them. With this in 
mind I undertake the task of outlin­
ing what football team best fits your 
personality:
St. Louis Rams: Rams people are 
flashy, good looking, and very fast- 
paced, but they lack substance. 
They’re just in it for the sex, which 
becomes predictable and old after a 
couple of times with them. They’re 
the proverbial exciting flash-in-the- 
pan person who is fun to follow 
around for a couple of months before 
they become annoying. Rams work 
best with: Bengals or Ravens.
Baltimore Ravens: Ravens people 
are excellent at defending them­
selves from getting hurt. They tend 
to have a good network of friends, 
but don’t let other people score on 
them. Any relationship they get into 
will be quick; they’ve been burned 
before and don’t let anyone else in to 
burn them again. Ravens work best 
with: Rams (short term) and 49ers 
or Packers (long term).
Pittsburgh Steelers: Like Ravens, 
Steelers defend themselves from get­
ting burned; however, they do like to 
be in relationships. They let people 
score on them, but can score just as 
easily on other people. Steelers don’t 
like being single; they make good 
boyfriends/girlfriends because they 
are most comfortable in a relation­
ship. Steelers work best with:
Packers, 49ers.
San Francisco 49ers: A perennial 
powerhouse who usually comes up 
short. 49ers have a lot to offer, but 
rarely seem to figure out how to use 
it. They’ve had glory days in the past, 
and are constantly striving to get 
back to that state. 49ers are self-con- 
scious and don’t have any game 
despite having all the qualities of a 
winner. They don’t defend well, and 
tend to get burned, but can score on 
someone else just as easily once they 
get rolling. 49ers work well with:
Bucs and Colts.
Tampa Bay Bucs: Loveable loser in 
the younger years, but flashy all­
stars of late. Bucs people have seen 
the lowest lows and the highest 
highs. They defend well against get­
ting hurt, but have trouble scoring 
on other people. They look good, 
and have a cocky personality, but 
will occasionally falter when they 
overlook difficulties in a relation­
ship. Bucs people work well with: 
Bengals or Packers
Indianapolis Colts: Perennial chok­
ers. Colts people, like 49ers, con­
stantly fail to live up to their poten­
tial. Occasionally they’ll get a good 
score, but tend to blow it after a 
short while. They are striving to 
silence all the critics who say they 
choke in the good relationships, and 
have a lot of potential to do just that 
in the near future. They need to 
defend better against getting burned, 
and rely on their ability to score on 
other people to lead them to victory. 
Colts work well with: Bucs, Steelers.
Cincinnati Bengals: These people 
suck, and have sucked for years 
when it comes to dating. They 
haven’t had a relationship in a long 
time, and are desperate. It is easy to 
score on them, but not always a posi-

Women tie, despite strong defensive effort
Male runners/¦
win, women 
place third

Staffwriter

Junior Staffwriter
For 85 minutes, the women’s soccer team dominated the 
University of Chicago on the field in a way unreflective of the 
scoreboard. An outstanding performance by junior goalkeep­
er Megan Monroe and the Tartan midfield held the #3 nation­
ally ranked Maroons to a 1-1 tie. The teams spent most of the 
first half on Chicago’s side of the field. Though the Maroons 
rarely cleared the ball, their defense prevented the Tartans 
from nearing the goal. Overwhelming pressure exerted by the 
Tartans prevented the Maroons from controlling play. 
Chicago passes failed to reach their destinations thanks to 
countless interceptions by the Tartan midfield. Efforts to 
cover Tartan attackers occasionally caused a few comical col­
lisions between Maroons. First-year Andrea Maresca led the 
defense, stopping Maroon progress throughout the field.
“We were dominating basically the whole game and felt 
very good about our playing,” said sophomore backfielder 
Mollie Salpeter. Despite their incredible performance, the 
Tartans could not score in the first half. Shortly after the sec­
ond half began, the Tartans broke through the Maroon 
defense, creating several excellent scoring opportunities. 
With 29:00 remaining in the half, sophomore Margaret Beck 
broke down the field, overpowered and outran Chicago 
defender Ellen Fitzgerald, and put the ball in the Maroon net. 
Beck was spectacular throughout the entire game and played 
a key role offensively and defensively. The Tartan goal fired 
up Chicago. After the kickoff, Chicago’s newfound intensity
was obvious as they began to shadow their opponents more 
closely. As the half continued, the Maroons gained more ener­
gy and speed. Chicago continued to pressure but failed to con­
vert penalty and corner kick opportunities into goals, largely 
due to goalkeeper Monroe’s skillful control of the net.
Monroe kept the Tartans in the game, holding Chicago 
scoreless until late in the second half. The Maroons’ persis­
tence and desperation was rewarded, though, when Renee 
Neuner broke through the Tartan defense to score with only 4 
minutes remaining, pushing the game into overtime.
“We let down during the last five minutes of the game, 
which is why they scored,” said Salpeter.
Both overtime periods passed without a goal from either 
team. The lack of scoring did not mean a lack of excitement 
though. Play moved back and forth between the two ends, 
highlighted by very physically aggressive action. Having come 
into the game as underdogs against the highly ranked 
Maroons, the Tartans showed a clear sign of being a strong 
team with the tie. Head coach Heather Kendra described the 
tie as bittersweet.
“We had them on the ropes for 85 minutes,” said Kendra. 
“There aren’t too many teams that could keep up with 
Chicago. We play knowing that anybody on any given day 
could win. Still, it’s disappointing to walk away without a 
win.”
The Tartans are on the road next weekend, facing 
University of Rochester (6-1-3) on Friday and Case Western 
(8-3-1) on Sunday in back-to-back conference games.
“We’ve hit our stride,” said Kendra. With these important 
games on the horizon, the timing couldn’t be better.Chicago defender Diana Connett protects the ball from the Tartans.

Before a large parents’ weekend crowd on 
Saturday morning, the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team suffered a heartbreaking overtime 
loss to UAA rival University of Chicago.
It took ninety-six minutes of play to decide the 
match. University of Chicago midfielder Eugene 
Sung broke the stalemate, heading a corner kick 
from Theo Arvanites past junior Tartan keeper 
Dave Thomas.
Chicago seemed to have the offensive edge 
early in the contest, placing four shots on goal, 
most of which came in the opening few minutes, 
and allowing none from Carnegie Mellon.
The Tartans matched their opponents’ aggres­
sion with sound team defense and tenacious play 
from the midfield. It wasn’t until the end of the 
first half that momentum began to shift in favor 
of the home team.
Sophomore midfielder Dan Mastalski jump- 
started the offense in the twelfth minute when 
his blocked shot earned a corner kick for the 
Tartans. After the kick was served into the 
University of Chicago’s box, a scramble ensued 
which culminated in a header beating the goal­
keeper, only to be stymied by the crossbar. 
Minutes later, first-year forward Jonathan 
Browne maintained Carnegie Mellon’s pressure 
by beating two Maroon defenders and blasting a 
shot over the goal. “I thought we controlled the 
game for the most part,” said Browne. “We could 
have capitalized on some opportunities and we 
didn’t.”

The second half shaped up much like the first, 
with Chicago controlling play early on and the 
Tartans fighting back. The Tartans, however, 
earned a slight edge in total shots on goal in the 
second half.
As the game progressed, emotion and frustra­
tion moved to the forefront and the game began 
to get rough. In the twenty-third minute of the 
second half, Tartan senior Eric Buhman was lev­
eled by Chicago defenders deep in Maroon terri­
tory, which briefly stopped play.
Less than four minutes later the battle was 
taken to the Tartan box, where goalkeeper 
Thomas shoved Maroon forward Rush Atkinson 
after snagging an airborne ball in front of the net. 
Each player was issued a warning and the game 
continued.
Desperation ensued and the nationally ranked 
Tartans struggled to mount offensive chances as 
the end of regulation time approached. But 
opportunities were not plentiful. The prepared 
Maroon defenders effectively anticipated 
attacks, closing down open space and turning 
upfield.
In the final minute Thomas made a diving save 
to send the game into overtime where the 
Tartans would eventually be defeated. Carnegie 
Mellon head coach Nick Gaudioso gave both 
teams deserved praise.
“This was a great effort today. Chicago is a 
strong team. We’re playing in a strong confer­
ence. All the teams are close. It looks like we’ll be 
playing a lot of one-goal games this year.”
“Everyone hates losing,” said Browne, “but we 
will continue to play the remainder of the season 
with the same game plan, which is winning.”
Last year, Carnegie Mellon was undefeated in 
the UAA conference and at Gesling Stadium. 
Yesterday’s loss, the first of the season, marks the 
first time the Tartans lost to the Maroons in 16 
years. Chicago improves its 2003 record to 
6-2-1, while the Tartans drop to 7-1-0. Each 
team is 1-1-0 in the UAA. Carnegie Mellon’s next 
home game is October 22 against Grove City.
This Saturday, the CMU men’s 
cross country team won their second 
invitational in a row, placing first in 
an 11-team field on their home 
course in Schenley Park. The 
women’s team fared similarly well, 
placing third. Both teams were sup­
ported by an excellent group of stu­
dents who came to cheer their class­
mates on.
The Tartan men dominated the 
meet, beating runner-up Allegheny 
21-54. CMU runners took 5 out of the 
top 7 places and 10 of the top 20 over­
all in a solid team effort.
The squad was led by sophomore 
Nick End, a mechanical engineering 
major from Wisconsin. End placed 
2nd in the meet, tying Dana Irrer’s 
school record on the challenging five- 
mile course with a time of 26:30. 
Irrer placed 3rd on this day, running a 
fine time of 26:46. Rounding out the 
scoring for the Tartans were senior 
tri-captains Jared Markowitz, Matt 
Meurer, and Patrick Fisher in 4th, 
5th, and 7th, respectively.
Meurer, known to many as “The 
Destroyer,” gave an especially gritty 
performance in running through the 
searing pain of an abdominal strain. 
The performances of the top four 
CMU finishers rank among the 
school’s top 15 all-time on the 
Schenley course.
Junior Chris Carroll and graduate 
student Mike Rossi completed the 
Tartan top 7, both running exception­
al times.
After the meet, Nick End said, “It 
was awesome for our team to have 
such a dominating performance on 
our home course.” That sentiment 
essentially summed up the feelings of 
the entire team about this meet.
On the woman’s side, junior chem­
ical engineering major Nicole Gartner 
paced the team with an 8th place fin­
ish. Gartner completed the hilly 5K 
course in 19:24 and was followed 
shortly by teammate Drea Garvue, a 
sophomore psychology major. 
Garvue had missed practice all week 
with a foot injury, but was still able to 
put on a stellar performance.
Rounding out the scoring for the 
Lady Tartans were Jocelyn Sikora 
(also running through injury), 
Maureen Tang, and Kelly Cronin. 
Carrie Mallozzi and Kate Helmstetter 
completed the CMU top 7. After the 
race, Nicole Gartner expressed pride 
in her team’s progress.
“The conference and NCAA region­
al meets are coming up in a few 
weeks, and I’m excited to compete — 
as a team, we are really working 
together well,” she said.
Nicole noted that several members 
of the team had shown improvement 
from earlier meets at Schenley, 
despite the unseasonably warm tem­
peratures of Saturday afternoon.
Next up for the men and women 
harriers is the Duquesne Invitational 
this Friday afternoon in Schenley 
Park. At that meet, a split squad for 
the Tartans will face some of the best 
local Division I competition.
The teams are also looking forward 
to the UAA Championships on 
November 1 and NCAA Regionals on 
November 15. Coaches Dario 
Donatelli and Drew Dershimer will 
undoubtedly have their teams ready 
to make a statement at these meets as 
well.

AB Anime
A new era in campus entertainment
Select Tuesday nights on campus will now 
offer more cartoons, thanks to the Activities 
Board and Kris Popendorf, chair of AB Films’ 
newest offshoot, AB Anime. Last Tuesday night, 
Popendorf screened the first installment of two 
recent anime series, Stellvia of the Universe and 
Get Backers, hourly, offering three showings of 
each.
“You can get into [Get Backers] even if you miss 
a few episodes, so that makes it good for this 
style of show,” he said. “Stellvia of the Universe is 
a really fun and addictive series, which is always 
a good way to get people hooked.”
They are also both free in this country, he said, 
unlike some already popular anime. The choice 
of anime is about right, said senior art major 
Leslie Klasterka: not too obscure, but nothing 
most people here have seen before.
“I don’t know if I’d call them mainstream 
anime. They’re little-known in America,” she 
said.
“This show is something I hadn’t heard of,” 
said her friend, local resident Paige Ashlynn. 
“That’s what I liked about it, being introduced to 
something new.”
Both series should last until the end of the year 
at least, said Popendorf.
“Get Backers might last even longer. We might 
pull it and switch,” he said. “The first step is to 
see how regular this is going to be.”
Though he was helped by AB Special Events 
chair Andrey Dolgov, a fifth-year business 
administration senior, and AB Films chair Clara

Li, a senior double major in design and human 
and computer interaction, organizing these 
showings was a job one person could do easily, 
said Popendorf. Slightly harder was translating 
the anime, something he worked on himself, as 
part of a fan/sub-group on Internet Relay Chat.
“Putting together a single episode usually 
takes about 10 people,” he said.
After taking courses in Japanese, Popendorf 
decided to study abroad in Japan. He returned at 
the last minute this fall, he said, but plans for the 
start of AB Anime didn’t solidify until a few 
weeks ago. Now, he hopes, people will continue 
to come. Popendorf counted 52 people at 
Tuesday’s screenings, and is excited to see what 
happens when word starts getting around.
“Krisp [Kris Popendorf] put a lot of effort into 
making posters, deciding what room to use, pick­
ing the shows, etc.,” said AB chair Chris Smoak, 
a senior computer science and psychology major. 
“There was a good showing this first week, and I 
only expect it to grow from here.”

September 22— Junior Staffwriter James Hart’s obituary of Johnny Cash contained factual errors. 
Luther Monroe Perkins was not the brother of legendary rockabilly performer Carl Perkins. “Ring of 
Fire” was recorded in March 1963 and was released in April 1963. It went to the number one posi­
tion on the C&W charts that summer. Cash and his first wife Vivian were divorced in 1968, not 1966.
October 6 — The movie Frida was misspelled in % movie as Frieda-, the wrong film was reviewed.
Also, in Big Al’s Metal Shop, the new Iron Maiden album, Dance of Death, was incorrectly labeled 
Blood Brothers. In Almanac, the entry from October 3, 1978, contained factual errors. Pluses and 
minuses would not be added to grades until all then-current students had graduated, and are not cur­
rently printed on undergraduate transcripts.
The Tartan corrects all known errors of fact. To report a correction or clarification, please contact the 
Editor-in-Chief Andrew Johnson at 412.268.2111.

ALMANAC.
50 YEARS AGO
October 14, 1953 — After six months of delay, President 
Warner announced that a general contract to build a new men’s 
dormitory had finally been approved. The new dorm, to be built 
with aluminum panelling and a “generous use of glass,” was to 
cost $1,000,000, house 243 students, and provide athletic 
locker space. Its design was chosen from among six bids. Today, 
this building is known as Donner Hall.
25 YEARS AGO
October 17, 1978 — The entire campus was pleased to hear 
that Herb Simon, a longtime professor in computer science, 
had been awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Economics. A much 
surprised Simon noted that he had not yet decided what to do 
with the $165,000 prize, and was still rather numb from the 
announcement. He received the award the following December 
in Stockholm, Sweden.
IQ YEARS AGO
October 18, 1993 — Concern mounted as a mysterious black 
substance began to accumulate in the University Computing 
Center. The substance, later identified as soot from a nearby 
boiler plant and exhaust from traffic on Forbes Avenue, was 
originally believed to have originated from a new high-velocity 
air circulation system, which had been installed when the orig­
inal ventilation system became inadequate to handle the num­
ber of computers in the building.
5 YEARS AGO
October 19, 1998 — The University mourned the passing of 
former president Richard Cyert, who had died of cancer at his 
suburban Fox Chapel home. A professor emeritus of economics 
and management at the time, Cyert had been president from 
1972 until 1990. He was remembered for his dedication to the 
campus community, making campus-wide networking a reality 
via the Andrew system and turning a $1 million deficit into a 
$300 million endowment. He was 77.
1 YEAR AGO
October 7, 2002 — The fate of smoking in the dorms was up 
in the air as SDC and Housing Services created a joint task 
force to investigate an increase in the number of smoke-free 
rooms on campus. At the time, 64 percent of all beds were in 
smoke-free rooms; the task force would meet to possibly change 
the status of parts or all of the remaining ten buildings. The task 
force would eventually recommend all residence halls become 
smoke-free, but smoking rooms still exist on campus to this day.

If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em
With friendly competition and community fun, the fourth annual Greek week sought to include non-Greeks for the first time
Jennifer Anttonen/Photo Staff
Junior business major Derek Li was one of many 
stuffed participants in Friday’s hotdog eating contest.
Greek Week has been a tradition at Carnegie Mellon 
University for four years now, but this is the first year 
in which Greek Week events were open to non-Greek 
students. The chairs of this year’s “My Big Fat Greek 
Week” tried to get awareness of Greek Week out into 
the public this year.
Opening ceremonies were held in Gesling Stadium 
on Sunday afternoon, immediately followed by the 
Greek Olympics. Before the games began, each partic­
ipating chapter had to paint a canvas banner high­
lighting a quality of their chapter.
For the Olympics, each house was pitted against 
another for physical challenges like a potato sack race, 
a tug of war, and an event where participants had to 
pass an orange to one another using only their necks. 
Beta Theta Pi fraternity won.
Monday night was Greek Week movie night. 
According to second-year computer science major 
Reinaldo Negron Jr. of Sigma Phi Epsilon, one of the 
four Greek Week Quad-Chairs, movie night would’ve
been a great success if not for fatal technical difficul­
ty-
“Movie night had a lot of interest until the projector 
overheated,” he said.
Tuesday was the blood drive. In order to raise 
awareness, the Greek Council had set up tables in the 
University Center for three days prior to the drive. The 
drive itself lasted six hours, and attracted 120 donors. 
The Pittsburgh Blood Bank came and talked to the 
Greek Council about the severe blood shortage, said 
Greek Council President and third-year business stu­
dent Misty Muscatel of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.
On Wednesday, Greek Week saw comedian Steve 
Hofstetter do a show at the Underground. Carnegie 
Mellon was his tenth stop on a 150-college tour. 
Having graduated from Columbia University only two 
years ago, Hofstetter focuses his comedy on college 
life.
The show was open to the whole campus, so its 
audience was composed non-Greek students in addi­
tion to fraternity and sorority members.
Powderpuff football games took place on Thursday 
afternoon on the CFA Lawn. Two all-female teams 
played each other, while two all-male teams compet­
ed against each other. Each game was played in two 
twenty-minute halves. In the female Powderpuff 
match, Delta Delta Delta and Delta Gamma played 
against Kappa Alpha Theta and Zeta Psi Sigma; the 
Delta Gamma and Tri-Delta team went on to win 20-
13.
Three fraternities participated in the men’s game, 
and since they couldn’t be easily divided up like the 
sororities were, the fraternities, Kappa Delta Rho, 
Sigma Phi Epsilon, and Beta Theta Pi, merged togeth­
er and split off into a team composed of freshmen and 
sophomores and one of juniors and seniors.
Even Greek students who were not participating 
still had the ability to help their chapters, because 
spectators in the stands were awarded participation 
points.
On Friday, the Greek Council held a picnic on the 
fraternity quad, which featured a hot dog eating con­
test and lots and lots of food. The picnic was a good 
relaxing way to round off the week, and it let people 
save their energy for the festivities the next day.
The closing ceremony to Greek Week was held 
Saturday night in Rangos Ballroom, preceded by the 
Moonlight Bachelor/Bachelorette Auction. About fif­
teen bachelors and bachelorettes were auctioned off 
for this service event, which raised $620 for St. Jude’s
Hospital.
One of the bachelorettes on auction was Courtney 
Syskowski, a sister at Zeta Psi Sigma and a senior his­
tory major. She said that at first she was really nerv­
ous about going out on stage and being involved in an 
event like a bachelorette auction, but she said that 
“once [she] got out there it was fun.”
Eric West (2nd year mechanical engineering) and 
Ryan Anderson (5th year architecture), two brothers 
from Kappa Delta Rho, were auctioned off together as 
“Team Muscle.” Anderson said that the auction was a 
great way to “put ourselves up on the market” — liter­
ally.
“We like being shown off,” said West.
As the auction drew to a close amidst raucous 
cheering and triumphant sprints as bidders claimed 
their dates, the winners of Greek Week were 
announced. The sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma came 
in third, Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity garnered sec­
ond, and Delta Delta Delta took first place.
The Greek Week quad-chairs were all very excited 
about this year’s Greek Week; the decision to try to 
bring in at least some of the non-Greek campus was a 
departure from the status quo. Muscatel said that 
Greek Week “has definitely stepped up to a new level 
this year.” Reinaldo Negron said “Greek Week is very 
much like Orientation, in the idea that each year is 
better.”
Many Greek Council members said that Greek Week 
was a helpful tool in reversing the stigma surrounding 
Greek life.
“It’s crucial for people on campus to se that there is 
more to Greek life than what you see on MTV,” said 
Quad-Chair Paloma Figueroa of Delta Delta Delta 
sorority, a 3rd year English major.
“Greek Week is one of the ways in which Greeks can 
show that the campus is better from having Greek 
Life,” said Negron.
However, many non-Greek students were close to 
oblivious about Greek Week. When she first saw flyers 
for Greek Week, Genevieve Barbee, a first year art stu­
dent, had a different idea of what it might be.
“At first I thought it was the Schatz [Dining Room] 
theme,” she said. “I was kind of disappointed, because 
I really like Greek food.”

Arch Enemy and Scott Eric Alexander of From Autumn to Ashes
Sena tdligw Anthems of Rebellion, hldbseg ,lvcG
Arch Enemy, led by the amazing guitarist Michael 
Arnott (of Carcass fame) and singer Angela Gossow, is 
about to become the underground’s worst kept secret. 
Mind-blowing technicality with riffs to make Eddie V. 
cry are what have propelled this band to metal’s fore­
front. Gossow’s vocals prove that women can excel in 
this male-dominated genre, and stellar production 
from Andy Sneap round out the total package. 
Highlights include “We Will Rise,” the first single 
“Leader of the Rats,” and the orgasmic intro riff of 
“Dead Eyes See No Future.”
If anything, Arch Enemy embodies the confidence 
that European musicians have in showcasing their tal­
ents. Arch Enemy’s contemporaries In Flames and 
Soilwork began this return to building a song around 
beautiful, powerful riffs and solos. Be sure to get up 
front on October 26 at Metropol as Arch Enemy hit the 
stage with Hatebreed, Slayer, and Sworn Enemy.

Mellow tones and dinosaur bones
An old-fashioned jam band in no danger of going extinct
Picture this. You’ve just gotten off work and are on 
your way home when you get caught in a horrible traf­
fic jam. The skies suddenly open up and rain begins to 
pummel the windshield of your car, which is slowly 
starting to overheat as news radio informs you that 
you’ll be stuck on your particular highway for the next 
45 minutes. Agitated, you turn the station and catch 
the ending of a song that you never particularly liked. 
You’re about to turn the station when an upbeat 
rhythm guitar makes your fingers pause on the dial. 
Listening to the syncopation of guitar and drums, your 
foot begins to tap and that scowl that was etched on 
your lips suddenly transforms into a grin of tranquili­
ty. A male voice soars through the playing instruments 
to deliver a message to your ears: “Just like the bron­
tosaurus, the bones are left behind to warn us.”
“Brontosaurus” is the first track of the Ohio band 
The Shantee’s most recently released LP, Four Now, 
and offers a fresh and easygoing feeling that seems 
missing in much of today’s music. The clear rhythms 
of bassist Ward Scott, lead guitarist and vocalist Matt 
Morton, keyboardist Randy Browne, drummer Shane 
Frye, and lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Mike 
Perkins give off feel-good vibes long after the last 
chords has been strummed.
“Here were these huge creatures that roamed the 
earth at some point and now they are not here any­
more,” said Perkins in an interview, above the barking
of his two “children” (a half chow, half golden retriev­
er named Banjo and a half labrador, half German 
shepherd named Allie). “One day we’ll no longer be 
here. [The song] is a reminder that nothing physical is 
forever and to make sure you’re just trying to be a 
good person.”
The Shantee got their start in 1995 at Denison 
University. Perkins, then a sophomore, discovered 
that Morton and Jason Mowery, both first-years and 
fellow graduates of Perkins’ high school, were also 
attending Denison. During the first week of school, 
they held an impromptu jam session in one of the 
dorm rooms. Within minutes, a crowd had gathered 
around their door, swaying and jiving to the energetic 
beats. The group, Perkins, Morton, and former per­
cussionist Mowery, played their first show three 
weeks later. Writing music is a collaborative effort 
among the members of The Shantee, even though 
Perkins is the writer of most of the lyrics and basic 
melody lines, which he calls the “stripped-down ver­
sion.” However, each of the members adds his own 
flavor to the particular instrument that he’s playing. 
In “Kiki,” Frye adds well-placed syncopated drum pat­
terns that contrast to Perkins’ choppy lyrics, pausing 
to let the mellowness of the words seep in.
In Brooke Theis’s review of The Shantee’s second 
album, Hydration, on ColumbusMusic.com, she said, 
“This Rock band is Folk, Jazz and Alternative all
[wrapped] into one.... They’re Phish-like, with a hint 
of The Grateful Dead, a pinch of Dave Matthews, a 
dash of Barenaked Ladies, and a teeny-tiny drop of 
O.A.R.” In the third and fourth tracks of Four Now, 
“Way Down” and “Rooftop,” Browne and Morton add 
spice to the back burner harmonies and rhythms, 
Browne providing organ-generated cadenzas over 
Morton’s cyclic, picked solos. But vocalist Perkins 
saves the jazz vocal style scat for live concerts.
“The English language is somewhat limiting some­
time. Part of this is just me being a baby, but some­
times I just don’t feel like expressing myself through 
English,” he said laughing. “Scatting is more sponta­
neous. It’s a lot like a guitar solo. I have no idea what 
I’m going to do. I just close my eyes and let it go.”
The Shantee’s next project will be their upcoming 
live double CD, due out around Christmas. The album 
will feature songs off their first two full-length 
albums, Lands Unknown and Hydration, as well as new 
songs that they are currently working on. The Shantee 
is in the process of negotiating a contract with start-up 
record label Studio E Group along with working on 
their new album. The Shantee will be opening for 
ekoostic hookah at Mr. Small’s Theatre, 400 Lincoln 
Avenue, Friday, October 17 for an all-ages show. The 
doors open at 7 pm and tickets are $15.

The price of expression
Currency artist J.S. G. Boggs faces government scrutiny for his use of money imagery
REVIEW:
Qdl OVLJL.comdI Lw —ncclJVIabebtb rL..hQdl v— Aci togglcI
Invited by the International 
Festival, J.S.G. Boggs displayed 
various banknotes of countries 
throughout the world in the UC 
gallery and lectured on the iconog­
raphy and mythology related to the 
images on currency.
Boggs’ work deals mainly with 
images of money and currency.
The lecture and exhibit both dis­
played the idea that each country 
uses its own currency to express its 
culture. Different icons on the cur­
rency show pride in a certain area 
of culture. Money typically con­
tains images of animals in some 
form.
The idea of animals and nature on 
banknotes expresses the natural 
background of each nation, and is 
also representative of some of the 
attitudes expressed and exuded by 
each country.
However, a theme of hypocrisy aris­
es within many of the bills fea­
tured. Depicting the idea of nature 
and preservation, a Brazilian bank­
note in the exhibit depicts a mother 
hummingbird feeding her young. 
However, Brazil is destroying its 
rainforest by the minute.
An Australian bill features a picture 
of an aborigine, alluding to 
Australia’s indigenous roots. But at 
one point during their develop­
ment as a nation, Australia tried to 
completely remove the aboriginal 
race from the continent. Also, this 
featured bill is one of the first notes 
to be made entirely of plastic.

When visual artist J.S.G. Boggs 
received a Fellowship of Arts & Ethics at 
Carnegie Mellon in 1992, the Secret 
Service raided his Carnegie Mellon 
office. He has also been arrested in 
England and Australia for doing the 
same things that have made him a 
prevalent and infamous figure in the 
world of art. Boggs is sometimes 
referred to as a money artist; almost all 
of his work reflects upon the iconogra­
phy and imagery of banknotes and cur­
rency. Due to the likeness of Boggs’ art­
work to actual currency, some contro­
versy has arisen about whether or not 
his work is legal.
Sponsored by the International 
Festival, an exhibit of some of Boggs’ 
collection of currency was displayed in 
the UC gallery. A lecture entitled 
“Money Images: The Cultural
Iconography of Currency,” given on 
Saturday, October 11, accompanied the 
display.
The story of Boggs’ start as a money 
artist is like his art — non-traditional 
and distinctive. While doodling in a 
diner with friends, Boggs discovered 
the value of art by paying for his dough­
nut and coffee with a one-dollar bill 
that he had drawn on a napkin. The 
waitress insisted on giving him ten 
cents change because the denomina­
tion on his “art” was one dollar. This ini­
tial transaction inspired and helped to 
formulate Boggs’ entire perception of 
art.
The entire philosophy behind Boggs’ 
work is the idea that money is only 
valuable when society deems it so. By 
producing his own forms of currency as 
artwork, when Boggs makes a transac­
tion with his art, it is not because the 
bills look like actual currency or 
because he is trying to counterfeit; his 
artwork retains some value to the recip­
ient, and that person is bartering for the 
artwork.
“I encourage all of you to reach into 
your own pocket and look closely at 
some of the finest portraits, landscapes, 
and geometric patterns in the world of 
art,” he said. “If you want a work of fine 
art, frame a one-dollar bill and actually 
look at it to appreciate the complexity 
and culture.”
Boggs’ exhibit within the UC gallery 
featured none of his own artwork. The 
exhibit, which is part of his personal 
collection, featured the banknotes and 
currency of various nations throughout 
the world.
“In a period of increasing nationalism 
that has resulted from recent events, it 
is important that we as the United 
States retain a perspective that we are 
only one country in an entire world of 
nations,” he said.

The whole world on the walls
At The Frame, students return from studying abroad with a fresh perspective and art to match
J.T. Trollman/Assistant Photo Editor
Cows Are So Weird, by Cheryl McLaughlin, was a response to her study abroad.
Keeping with the theme of the 
International Festival, The Frame has a 
show this week where art and design 
students are displaying the work from 
their international journeys.
All of the CFA art and design under­
graduate students who studied abroad 
last year were invited to participate in 
"Detox: Study Abroad Show" at The 
Frame.
Whether the artwork returned on the 
plane or was indirectly inspired by 
memories and experiences abroad, it 
was all included in the show.
“It’s not a cohesive show; it’s just work 
that wasn’t done here,” said Janine 
Mercando, a senior art major and co­
director of The Frame. “Some people 
are working from stuff that they didn’t 
conceptually make while they were 
away, but they had developed while 
they were abroad. It is not necessarily 
just stuff that was created in these other 
places.”
Students in the exhibit visited at least 
ten different countries and cities includ­
ing Italy, Scotland, Ireland, New 
Zealand, London, Paris, Milan, and 
Rome. Their work, mosdy photography, 
reflects what they learned in the differ­
ent environments abroad.
Any person who leaves home to live in 
a completely different country experi­
ences some level of culture shock. 
Sometimes there is more to learn from 
the environment and culture than from 
the school itself.
Leslie Vega, a senior art major, took 
pictures of her surroundings.
“I took a lot of photography, a lot of 
pictures. I did paintings and drawings 
primarily because I was allotted studio 
space and I would go into the studio 
every day and try to work from there," 
said Vega. "I took a lot of pictures 
because I work better knowing my 
space. It was hard leaving here, 
Pittsburgh, where I’m familiar with my 
surroundings, and going to a different 
place."
Some students felt that their time 
away had helped them to define their
art. The time away gave the artists a 
chance to explore new things and 
experiment in ways that might not have 
been available here at Carnegie Mellon.
“Mosdy what changed is the way I 
think about my work. I have the whole 
idea before I begin as opposed to figur­
ing it out halfway through,” said Ashley 
Harwood, a fifth-year senior art major.
The methods of teaching art at 
Carnegie Mellon vary widely with those 
taught abroad. The students encoun­
tered different learning techniques.
“Here I have separate classes with 
projects and deadlines, but there I did­
n’t have any classes. I just did art work. 
I had a mentor and other visiting artists 
to guide me,” said Christina Mercando, 
a senior art major.
“The first two years here are founda­
tion courses with stiff deadlines," said 
Biunno. “It’s not until your junior year 
that you’re expected to do here what 
you would’ve been doing there for a 
couple of years.”
“All the people have their conceptual 
basis and this body of work that they’ve 
been working on, and you’re going in 
there fresh," said Vega. "In their third 
year they don’t have classes; they just 
have studio time. You go in there carte 
blanche."
The art and design students, who 
include Mercando, Lindsey Cortese, 
Ashley Harwood, David Hurwich, 
Kristina Lazar, Cheryl McLaughlin, 
Vega, Becky Clutter, and Rie Kawana, 
displayed mainly photography, but 
included some of their other work as 
well. The show, which runs through 
Tuesday, allows students to see how 
they and their peers have changed their 
art while they were away.
“You really had to find yourself. Their 
system is so different,” said Mercando. 
“Coming back, I am so much more com­
fortable making artwork. I found what I 
like doing.”
“After not seeing people’s work for a 
semester - or some people, a year, it’s 
interesting just seeing what they did 
and where they’re at now,” said Biunno.

REVIEW:Qdl einMI AscLoM (2d0s0i Qdl )co,lThrough Tues., October 14
“Detox: Study Abroad Show” at the 
Frame gave the perfect chance for 
the world-weary CFA art and 
design students to use their foreign 
influences by showing the CMU 
community what they learned 
while they were away. Most of the 
artists documented their travels 
abroad with either color or black 
and white photography.
From photographs of complicated 
and elaborate Parisian doors to 
black and white photos of people in 
a restaurant, the works varied 
widely. Becky Clutter, a senior 
design major, made slides from her 
photos of the Czech Republic and 
turned them into mobiles. Pictures 
of different parts of cows - an eye, 
a hoof, and cow hindquarters lined 
up in a row -- covered one wall. The 
pictures captured the farm atmos­
phere perfectly. Not all artists dis­
played solely photography. One 
sewed a quilt from cards and letters 
and painted her thoughts in sen­
tence form. Ashley Harwood, a 
fifth year senior art major, made 
drawings using geometrical shapes 
and circles. Most of the art was 
two-dimensional, or on a smaller 
scale.
“I think a lot of people had the 
same idea,” said Harwood. “They 
made stuff that they could carry 
back.”
The show was mostly documentary 
in nature and was interesting 
because of the glimpses it offered 
into different cultures. The photo­
graphs showed people interacting 
and displayed examples of beauti­
ful architecture. The art in general 
allowed people to see what the 
artists experienced while they were

Tolerance and pride
Carnegie Mellon provides a nurturing environment for students of all sexual orientations
J.T. Trollman/Assistant Photo Editor
The National Coming Out Day Dance, “Dirty Pop,” which featured a theme inspired by Andy Warhol, took place last 
Saturday night in Highlander Café.
Michel Foucault propounded the notion that to 
understand the nature of human sexuality is to under­
stand the nature of identity in The History of Sexuality. 
In an interview six years after the first volume was 
published, the contemporary theorist declared, “Sex is 
boring.” Problems about the identity of the self are 
more complex than one’s sexuality. Accordingly, gay 
college students today would like an existence that 
allows them to incorporate sexuality without letting it 
define them completely; a way to be proud'of it in a 
way that allows them to be proud of who they really 
are.
Adam Atkinson came to college wondering if he 
would ever have the chance to be honest with people 
about his sexuality.
“I grew up in and around Pittsburgh, and when I 
came to Carnegie Mellon, that good old Western 
Pennsylvania homophobia still had its death grip on 
me,” said Atkinson, a junior English major. “I entered 
my freshman year sticking to my long-term plan about 
lying about my sexuality forever. But Carnegie Mellon 
really turned things around for me. Most of the reac­
tions [to my coming out] were very low key.”
Through its students and administration, the 
University offers a variety of clubs, organizations, and 
resources to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender 
(GLBT) students. But even more traditional organiza­
tions at CMU are affected by the climate that freed
Atkinson from his secrecy. He is a brother at Sigma Phi 
Epsilon and faces no negative reactions when he 
brings his boyfriend to social events.
“I am just as much a brother and just as much a man 
as anyone else in the house, and I love that feeling,” he 
said. Atkinson is something of a goofy character, 
whose hair cannot be trusted to stay a particular color, 
whose jests come free-form and witty, possibly an out­
growth or at least indicative of his love of improv. He is 
a member of the No-Parking Players.
“I was afraid that, after coming out, that a lot of my 
behaviors would now be labeled ‘gay,’ rather than just 
silly or off-the-wall, as they had been before,” said 
Atkinson. “By asserting a part of my identity, I worried 
I would lose the rest of it.”
Atkinson, in addition to finding his fears largely 
unfounded, also found a supportive environment at 
home. His friends and family adjusted very quickly, 
inspiring him to discuss his journey with others.
October is Pride Month at CMU and features a series 
of events sponsored by the many GLBT-oriented 
groups on campus. SoHo, the student-run sexual 
health office that serves as a general gathering spot for 
students of all orientations, ALLIES, and cmuOUT, 
sponsor the eventful month, merely Pride Week until 
last year. ALLIES is a group of people encompassing all 
sexual orientations and gender identities who support
the community, and cmuOUT is a student-run group 
of GLBT students.
Pride Month at CMU celebrates sexual diversity, 
emphasizing that a student need not be ostentatious to 
have pride in his or her sexuality. Like Women’s 
History Month and Black History Month, the celebra­
tion, which draws attention to underrepresented 
groups, is sometimes criticized for excluding others.
Events include weekly ALLIES-sponsored 
OUTspoken meetings, “Let’s Talk About Sex,” a series 
about safer sex practices, SafeZone sensitivity train­
ing, and the National Coming Out Day dance, this year 
called “Dirty Pop,” that followed a Warholian theme 
and took place on October 11.
“Why should pride month just be one month? 
Reality said it’s not year-round,” said Michele Grab, 
associate dean of Student Affairs at a weekly ALLIES 
meeting. Clara Bittner-Rossmiller, an SHS junior, went 
through much of what Atkinson did, but her experi­
ence has been mixed.
“It’s about being proud of who you are, not neces­
sarily being an activist,” said Bittner-Rossmiller. 
“Zealous pride can be dangerous.”
While active in the community, Bittner-Rossmiller 
said that she has no specific urge to be around gay peo­
ple. As a member of AB Tech, she finds the campus 
organization to be very welcoming to gay students.
After gathering the courage to come out, Bittner- 
Rossmiller said that her family did not welcome her 
sexuality, increasing her appreciation for the support 
she found at CMU. She has, in general, found the envi­
ronment to be fairly welcoming, but has had some 
negative experiences. One acquaintance said to her, “I 
can accept your alternative lifestyle, but I’m a conser­
vative.” On another occasion at the grocery store, 
Bittner-Rossmiller excused herself after having 
blocked a man’s access to the freezer. Noticing her 
rainbow-patterned headscarf, he said, “Don’t apolo­
gize to me. Apologize to a priest.”
But still, she has become more comfortable in her 
identity.
Bittner-Rossmiller said she does not mind the word 
“dyke.” “I actually don’t like the word ‘lesbian,’ “ she 
laughs. “I prefer ‘gay.’ ”
Language can be an emotionally charged part of 
relations between the GLBT community and everyone 
else. The GLBT community has been able to reclaim 
some terms once declared derogatory, but few have 
embraced the term “faggot,” which refers to the bun­
dle of sticks once used as kindling in burning con­
demned homosexuals. Vijay Jesrani, a sophomore 
social and decision sciences major, said that while 
most people of his generation do not find the term 
“quee?’ derogatory, many in the previous generations 
do.
“‘Transsexual’ is an archaic term being phased out,” 
said Jesrani. “Transgender is the current general term 
and can refer to people who have or have not had an
opillbox. 13 October 2003.

operation. Transvestites live and dress as the opposite 
physical sex.”
Most GLBT students, said Bittner-Rossmiller, prefer 
the umbrella term “gay.”
“Many squash the idea of being bi,” she said. “I felt 
excluded because at the time, I had never had a girl­
friend.”
In addition to the student organizations, the Office 
of Student Affairs recently designated a niche, called 
SafeZone, that supports and brings attention to GLBT 
issues and concerns, ensuring that University pro­
grams and services include and support the communi­
ty. Ron Ophir, who left Carnegie Mellon last year, 
started the program. Current GLBT coordinator 
Rowshan Palmer took over, and also hired two student 
interns, Bittner-Rossmiller and Jesrani. The student 
interns carry much of the responsibility for the imple­
mentation and development of many activities on 
campus, including Pride Month.
Prior to coming to CMU, Palmer worked at a 
Catholic university. She is the informal advisor to 
GLBT issues as well as to other Student Affairs activi­
ties like Buggy and Convocation, and finds Carnegie 
Mellon more accepting than other schools without stu­
dent groups geared towards GLBT students.
“These organizations are particularly important, 
because it is still somewhat socially acceptable to dis­
criminate against gay students,” she said. Palmer 
would like to promote undergraduate outreach pro­
grams, like ALLIES weekly OUTspoken meetings, 
which invite all members of the community to discuss 
GLBT issues, and SafeZone.
SafeZone is a three-hour training session that hopes 
to give an understanding of what it means to be GLBT, 
and how to be a good straight “ally.” Staff at Student 
Affairs, Health Services, resident assistants, communi­
ty advisors, and house fellows all participate in 
SafeZone training. In addition, many other students, 
faculty, and staff have enrolled and become certified 
SafeZone members. Participants learn what it means 
to be an ally, whether they choose to publicize it by 
joining a list and posting stickers and pins or to pri­
vately help anyone who chooses to confide in them. 
Members are taught to provide information, 
resources, and advice. The Student Affairs web page 
has a registration form. SafeZone training is offered 
frequently throughout the year.
Often, first-year college students are for the first 
time breaking from the cultural milieu that has raised 
them and begin to form beliefs in keeping with their 
interests and experiences. Bittner-Rossmiller and 
Jesrani find their SafeZone internships rewarding.
Now a lesbian in a committed relationship, Bittner- 
Rossmiller believed until college that she was bisexu­
al.
“When I came out to my boyfriend at the time, he 
sputtered, ‘But you’re limiting your choices!?’ ” she 
said.
Jesrani’s friends were surprisingly neutral.
“Most said, ‘Yeah? So?’ “ he said.
Jesrani, an Indian-American, is not out to his par­
ents and relatives, who are unlikely to be sympathetic. 
Otherwise, he has not found his race an issue. It comes 
up only rarely among his gay friends, who are mostly 
white, though there is a smattering of all races.
Many GLBT students find sanctuary at SoHo in the 
Old Student Center; once just the school’s sexual 
health office, it now provides a supportive environ­
ment and general resources about GLBT issues. 
Interns Bittner-Rossmiller and Jesrani spend many 
hours maintaining the center and organizing activi­
ties.
“It’s a nice place to hang out,” said Jesrani. “You can 
hang out, watch Queer as Folk.”
“Sometimes people just come in to use the 
microwave or to take a nap,” added Bittner-Rossmiller.
“Many students don’t feel comfortable talking about 
issues with anyone,” said Jesrani. “We can talk to stu­
dents and help them decide how to come out, and to 
whom. Over the summer, SoHo attracted many Pre- 
College students, many of whom were only beginning 
to acknowledge their sexualities. We weren’t sure how 
to reach them, but they came to us. Every day we 
talked to kids, and they felt good coming out. We want 
to make things safe. We would never ask for a show of 
hands or anything.”
SoHo has continued to be a resource for general 
information about sexual issues. The center stocks a 
range of supplies and resources. Most books and 
videos concern gay or specifically sexual issues, but 
the library is expanding. If unable to help students 
themselves, SoHo members can redirect them to the 
right place, whether that be HIV testing at Health 
Services or the Pittsburgh Transgender Support 
Group.
Health Services, in conjunction with Student 
Affairs, has implemented “Let’s Talk About Sex,” a 
series about safer sex that is not pertinent to sexual 
preference.
“They are general principles for good sex and rela­
tionships with a partner,” said Anita Barkin, Director 
of Health Services. She and Health Educator Nancy 
Schmidt developed the series after examining biases 
in the first-year orientation discussion, and found they 
needed to be more conscious of gay students. The next 
“Let’s Talk About Sex” discussion will take place 
October 20 and will deal with sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs).
“There are few people who are purely homosexual 
or heterosexual; most are in the middle,” said Barkin. 
Health Services hopes it does the same for GLBT stu­
dents as it does for heterosexual students.
“Students are turned off if we assume they’re 
straight,” said Schmidt.
“The richness of experience that diversity provides 
extends beyond sex, race, and religion,” said Barkin.
Schmidt has assisted research studies of sexual 
minorities at the University of Pittsburgh, called the 
Epidemiological Study of Health Risk in Lesbians 
(ESTHER). Much research concerning homosexuals 
has been devoted to AIDS research; these studies 
involve other issues and concerns.
“We were concerned that lesbian [women], for 
example, were not seeking the same gynecological 
care that heterosexual women do,” said Schmidt. “But 
they do, in fact, take even better care of themselves, 
though there are slightly higher incidences of depres­
sion, alcoholism, and weight gain.”
“We support students in many ways; counseling, 
stress management, and, importantly, social support. 
It’s important to keep people connected and to give 
them a sense of belonging,” said Barkin. Students 
dealing with sexuality may have higher stress and 
lower immunity levels. Often, students who are 
stressed turn easily to drugs and alcohol.
Health Services’ insurance policy has been including 
same-sex benefits for the past five years. The 
University extended the same benefits one year later. 
Same-sex partners fight much discrimination in quo­
tidian necessities like hospitalization, housing, own­
ing property, opening a bank account, and adoption.
“Carnegie Mellon extends all the benefits of married 
couples to same-sex partners,” said Schmidt. 
“Problems arise in verifying domestic partnership, 
because there is no marriage license, but a display of 
commitment like both names on a lease will usually do 
it.”
Officially recognized campus resources for trans­
gender students are multiplying as well. Bittner- 
Rossmiller spoke with Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy about unisex bathrooms. Though she was 
confused at first, the idea that a student may go 
through severe anxiety about which room to enter 
struck Murphy quickly, she said. New House has uni­
sex bathrooms.
In general, Student Affairs is sensitive to gender and 
homosexual relationships in its language as well.
“My sense is that GLBT students’ biggest concerns 
[about coming out] are with peers and family mem­
bers,” said Michael West, a professor of French in 
whom many GLBT students have confided. “In an 
ideal world, an individual’s sexual preference and gen­
der identity would be just another aspect of personali­
ty like religion or ethnicity. Of course, then you look 
around the world and see how much suffering is 
caused by religious intolerance or ethnic strife and you 
see how much work we still have to do.”
“The mainstreaming of gay culture is a decidedly 
mixed bag,” said West, referring to popular television 
shows like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Will and 
Grace. “What’s being promoted as acceptable, and 
even daring, is the infinitely entertaining asexual — 
that is to say non-challenging — gay man, who is more 
decorative than anything else. Is this better than the 
gay man associated with drag queens, leather queens, 
and people with AIDS, as prevailed through the eight­
ies and nineties? These role models have been suc­
cessfully segregated from the reality of most people. 
Real life is, fortunately, much more diverse.”
While Jesrani and Bittner-Rossmiller find enough 
resources on campus, many students, including 
Davidson, think better opportunities are available in 
Pittsburgh.
“I’m not a member of a GLBT organization at CMU, 
so I don’t really know about the kinds of support they 
offer,” said Travis Davidson. Davidson entered CMU’s
pillbox. 13 October 2003.

Helen Gosselin, right, talks to a parent who wished to remain unidentified at the 
CMU Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) meeting Saturday.
School of Music, but is now a senior in 
the business program. “When I was a 
freshman, as a voice major, I felt very 
accepted. I really faced no issues of 
intolerance or discrimination. However, 
when I became a business major, it was­
n’t quite the same.”
Davidson enjoys working with some 
of his business school colleagues, but 
his closest friends are still in the music 
department. After transferring, he 
found it harder to see his friends in the 
music department due to conflicting 
schedules, and spent more time with 
friends who do not go to CMU.
“It was nice to have gay friends, but at 
the same time, I think it put some strain 
on my schoolwork because my personal 
life felt completely removed from my 
school life,” he said.
“I think that Pittsburghers are becom­
ing more tolerant; there are many gay- 
oriented clubs, bars and restaurants. If 
you don’t like to go out, though, it may 
be more difficult. Many of the friends 
I’ve made in Pittsburgh don’t go to 
CMU,” said Davidson
Proudly Presents is an all-gay theater 
that practices in a gay bar, with a 
Thursday transgender night. The organ­
ization also supports all Pittsburgh area 
transgenders.
Students also identify Wendy Miller 
as a Pittsburgh transgender person who 
has undergone an operation, is finally 
in the right body, and can finally be who 
she thinks she is. She serves as an advi­
sor to many transgenders. cmuOUT 
and ALLIES not only join forces with 
other campus organizations, but with 
some in the area; they send representa­
tives to some Gay, Lesbian, and Straight 
Education Network (GLSEN), and 
Parents, Friends, and Families of 
Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) meetings. 
Last year, cmuOUT and ALLIES helped 
several high schools start Gay-Straight 
Alliances with the help of GLSEN. There 
are twenty to twenty-five regulars at 
cmuOUT and ALLIES meetings. SoHo, 
CMU’s GLBT resource center, had fifty 
students at its initial gathering. Being 
gay is not all about GLBT groups, 
though.
“If the central cause of coming out is 
acceptance, the community must also 
be accepting,” said Justin Whitney, a 
first-year computer science student. “It 
cannot be exclusive.”
It is still easier, however, to discuss 
some issues with gay people than with 
heterosexuals, said Jesrani.
“If I want to talk about ‘gay issues’ or 
even say, ‘That guy’s cute,’ it’s easier to 
talk about it with other gay people,” he 
said.
“All are welcome,” said Jesrani. 
“Almost all GLBT groups conduct activi­
ties with another organization. We’re 
not trying to segregate. Though 
cmuOUT sometimes has a reputation 
for being cliquish and oriented entirely 
toward gay males, they don’t want to be 
segregationist at all.”
Many feel it is important to establish a 
certain comfort level, hence the popu­
larity of SoHo as a social space. 
However, the GLBT world and the 
straight world obviously collide.
“When you come out, don’t forget 
your friends who aren’t gay,” said Maya 
Nigrosh, a fifth-year computer science 
student.
Nigrosh played on the women’s soc­
cer team for four years as an undergrad­
uate. Though out to almost everyone 
she knew, her teammates and coach 
had no idea.
“It was hard to keep quiet, but it felt 
necessary at the time,” she said.
Nigrosh finally told the coach, who, 
despite the initial shock, was fully sup­
portive.
“She just reddened,” said Nigrosh. 
“When she [was finally able to speak], 
she said, ‘Statistically, there’s probably 
someone else on the team.’”
“I’ve learned to set my standards 
higher,” said Atkinson of his identity 
since coming out. “I decided I was just 
going to be myself and let people react 
however they may. Also, I let myself get 
less upset by bigots and stubborn social 
conservatives than I used to.”
Though it will always be significant, 
the issue of sexuality is one of the only 
factors that makes Carnegie Mellon a 
diverse university.
“From a personal point of view, I can 
say that my being gay has always been a 
non-issue. So what?” said West. “Aren’t 
we more interesting than our sexual 
preferences? I’m a professional educa­
tor, not a professional gay man.”
Simon Li, a junior in H&SS and 
cmuOUT president said that when he 
arrived on campus, cmuOUT and 
ALLIES were both dormant. Now, in 
addition to the expansion of Pride 
Week, more meetings and events are 
being held on campus.
“I tend to think the typical gay stu­
dent [at CMU] is more understated 
than gay students at some other univer­
sities,” said Li, who questioned the 
University’s environment when he first 
arrived. “They may be out of the closet, 
but it doesn’t necessarily affect their 
demeanor.”
“I largely found the environment, and
I still do, apathetic at best,” said Li. 
“People don’t seem to care too much 
about students’ sexual orientations. 
One theory is that CMU students are too 
academically focused and tend to iden­
tify with a major rather than other char­
acteristics about themselves.”
Li said also that GLBT students may 
also at this point be too assimilated in 
the community to draw attention to or 
care much about Pride and GLBT issues. 
The issue is not forced.
“We’re here if you want us, but some 
people don’t see the need to join a GLBT 
group,” Bittner-Rossmiller said. Though 
generally comfortable at Carnegie 
Mellon, students are still sometimes vic­
tims of homophobia, and the campus 
dialogue reflects the progress, and the 
progress yet to come for GLBT concerns.
“My sentiment is that some racial 
minority groups on campus can be less 
tolerant, as well as some fraternities 
and religious organizations,” said Li.
“For the most part, though, anyone 
can be accepted here,” said Jesrani.
“You can take your friends on dates 
with straight people.”
For some students, having a pride 
month highlights the discrepancies in 
privilege between GLBT and straight 
students, and highlights the frequent 
attribution of many things to sex.
“Pride is about appreciation. You just 
know it,” said Whitney. “It can take on 
many forms.”
“I don’t want a month, I want a whole 
year,” said Nigrosh. “I march in events, 
but my life is not entirely about being
gay”
“The existence of organizations like 
SoHo, ALLIES, and cmuOUT has done a 
tremendous amount of good work in 
promoting the visibility of support sys­
tems for GLBT students,” said West. 
“The University has a leadership role 
here, and even though we still have a 
way to go in terms of promoting diversi­
ty, especially racial diversity, I think 
we’re on the right track.”

War of the poses
In their latest comedy, the Coen brothers take on love and marriage
Breaking from their normally darkly comedic works 
such as Fargo and O Brother, Where Art Thou?, direc­
tors Ethan and Joel Coen have tried their first roman­
tic comedy, Intolerable Cruelty. The successful combi­
nation of the palpable chemistry between George 
Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones and the Coen 
brothers’ dark humor puts a new spin on the timeless 
battle of the sexes storyline.
The opening scene sets the stage for the entire 
movie: an incredibly wealthy man comes home to find 
his wife in bed with the proverbial pool man. The hilar­
ious escapades that ensue poke fun at divorce and 
marriage in general. Intolerable Cruelty is a love story 
about loveless marriage and women pitted against 
men over money.
It shows how love and marriage are just a sham, 
while proving that true love will pull through in the 
end if the man and woman are meant for each other. 
Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is an ambi­
tious gold digger who is at the same time vulnerable 
and endearing. Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a 
ruthless divorce attorney who has become bored with 
his success. They meet when Miles represents 
Marilyn’s husband in her divorce, and instantly, sparks
fly. Miles succeeds in denying Marilyn any compensa­
tion from her divorce, and starts a cat and mouse 
game, which engages the two for the entire movie. 
Each new plot development involves Miles or Marilyn 
trying to get one up on the other.
Their undeniable attraction only adds to the excite­
ment of the game. Marilyn admits that she only mar­
ries so she can divorce and gain wealth and independ­
ence. She and her Beverly Hills divorcée friends sit at 
the spa and discuss the spoils they have gained from 
their respective divorces. Her only goal is money, and 
she does not let love get in the way, until she meets 
Miles. Miles’s unstoppable ambition has made him the 
most valued divorce lawyer at his firm and has 
brought him wealth as well as success, but only real­
izes that more possessions only bring more boredom 
and loneliness. When he meets Marilyn, he is instantly 
intrigued. Chasing her gives him the excitement he 
craves, and challenges him in ways he never expected. 
A full cast of talented supporting actors provide a rich 
background in front of which Zeta-Jones and Clooney 
play. The parts could not have been better cast; 
Clooney and Zeta-Jones set the screen on fire. The 
supporting cast also offers much of the comic relief 
needed to break up the sexual tension between Miles
Here comes the Bride
Quentin Tanrantino returns with a wild mix of glam, gore and gangster warfare
Quentin Tarantino has always pushed the envelope 
when it comes to violence. In Kill Bill, however, he 
really goes over the edge. The result is a film that is 
incredibly violent and shocking. It is also funny, 
engrossing, and technically superb.
The film starts out with a close-up in black and 
white of The Bride (Uma Thurman) lying in a pool of 
her own congealing blood. The Deadly Viper Assassin 
Squad has murdered all the members of her wedding 
party. She lies helpless and pregnant as a faceless man 
stands over her with a gun. The man, we learn, is Bill 
(David Carradine). After a boring speech about 
masochism, Bill shoots her in the head and leaves. 
From this point on, the plot is very simple. The name­
less Bride, suspiciously like Jeanne Moreau in Francois 
Truffaut’s The Bride Wore Black, is going to hunt down 
and kill the five people who ruined her life.
The Bride wakes up from a coma four years later to 
find that she has lost her child and part of her skull. 
She also finds that she has lost the ability to walk. 
After literally beating the brains out of an orderly who 
pimps comatose patients to local perverts, she steals a 
wheelchair and gets to his truck, where she slowly 
“wills” herself to walk again.
Once she gets her legs back, watch out. Deadly 
Vipers. As in Pulp Fiction, Tarantino plays around with 
time, and things don’t always happen in order. The 
first person we see The Bride take on is Vernita Green, 
aka Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox). After a hilarious fight 
scene, Vernita reveals that The Bride is actually Black 
Mamba, a former member of the assassin squad. The 
film then goes back in time to Black Mamba’s first bat­
tle with O-ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu). 0- 
ren’s story is told in an extended anime sequence, a 
technique that serves to add style and, presumably, 
avoid an NC-17 rating. From this point on, the story is 
one long, glorious fight to the death.
Kill Bill is vaguely reminiscent of many different 
films and television shows of the 1970s without being 
blatantly derivative. Different scenes will remind 
audiences of martial arts films like Enter the Dragon, 
television shows like Kung Fu, Charlie’s Angels, and The 
Six Million Dollar Man, and blaxploitation flicks like 
Coffy and Foxy Brown.
Vivica Fox as Vernita Green is no Pam Grier, but she 
comes pretty close. Casting former Rung Fu star David 
Carradine as Bill is a brilliant stroke. But never does 
Kill Bill turn into a wink-and-nod parody. Uma
and Marilyn. Billy Bob Thornton plays an over-the-top
oil tycoon; Geoffrey Rush is an arrogant soap opera 
producer; and Paul Adelstein plays Miles’s sidekick 
Wrigley, an ambitious divorce attorney who cries 
uncontrollably at weddings. It is the supporting char­
acters’ interplay that provides the majority of the clas­
sic Coen humor.
Overall, the film was thoroughly entertaining and 
even laugh-out-loud funny at some points. The perfect 
chemistry between Clooney and Zeta-Jones captivated 
the audience and kept them hoping that the two leads 
would end up together despite the odds against them. 
A few scenes dipped into the stereotypical love story, 
such as Miles’s public profession of love in front of a 
crowd of cynics and the resulting spontaneous stand­
ing ovation. At the same time, this movie gives hope to 
the audience that true love does exist. Miles and 
Marilyn view love and marriage more coldly than any­
one, yet they cannot lielp getting caught up in love 
with each other and throwing out all their precon­
ceived notions about the foolishness of love mixed 
with marriage.

Thurman is a master of wearing a stoic face, and we 
never once doubt her seriousness and determination. 
Lucy Liu is a lot of fun to watch as assassin-turned- 
Yakuza O-ren Ishii. Darryl Hannah as California 
Mountain Snake (which suggests they ran out of cool 
snakes) is hilarious and perfecdy evil. She hasn’t been 
such a good villain since Blade Runner.
In Kill Bill, Tarantino effortlessly combines the 
slasher, sleazy schlock and kung fu film subgenres into 
a magnum opus that is definitely more than the sum of 
its parts. A bit of the old ultra-violence is a necessary 
evil, however. In order to succeed in its efforts, Kill Bill 
has to be stupendously over-the-top. It slices, dices, 
dismembers and scalps its victims with enormous suc­
cess.

When Juraj Adamik’s grandfather taught him to jug­
gle at the age of 13 in their native country of Slovakia, 
they practiced with many different objects, he said, to 
give him a versatility most jugglers never achieve.
Adamik also studied folk dance extensively and 
learned a little theater on the side, so that by the time 
he came to college at Duquesne University, he had trav­
eled all over the world to compete in folkdance, tap 
dance, and juggling.
Now, Adamik dances with the Duquesne 
Tamburitzans — and juggles axes.
“They’re not real axes. They’re specially prepared for 
the stage,” said Darlene Fejka, the assistant to the 
Tamburitzans’ director of media development, Paul G. 
Stafura.
Adamik’s axes are only one of the things that make 
the internationally renowned folkdance and musical 
ensemble unique. In all his travels, Adamik said, he has 
never seen another group that stuck to authentic, tra­
ditional dances and music while maintaining such a 
versatile and varied repertoire from so many different 
countries.
“We try to gather the best, to squeeze each culture 
and get the best from it,” he said. “At this point, we’re 
sort of unique.”
The troupe consists of 36 performers, said Fejka, 18 
men and 18 women. All of them sing, 26 of them 
dance, and 10 of them also play traditional ethnic 
instruments like the folk bagpipe, many sizes and kinds 
of the stringed tamburitza, and the Armenian duduk, 
an apricot-wood reed instrument that resembles a 
recorder.
The dances, which come from all over Eastern 
Europe and several surrounding countries, sometimes 
including the Mediterranean, are choreographed by 
some of the world’s leading folklorists at a 25-day 
camp held each year toward the end of summer at the 
Kiski School in Saltsburg, PA, said Fejka.
From there, the troupe usually tours for several 
weeks in the Midwest to get the show together. Then, 
the performance season begins in earnest, said 
Amanda Snyder, a music education major.
“Once school starts, we usually have performances 
every weekend, Saturday and Sunday, and rehearse for 
about three hours every Friday night,” said Snyder. 
“On long weekends and breaks, we still perform.”
Winter break ends by New Year’s Eve for the 
Tammies; by then, it’s back on the road, said Synder.
Through it all, 
each Tammie has to 
maintain good grades, 
on pain of being dropped 
from the troupe, said Adamik, 
who is also a biology major.
The school compensates all this work with a 
break in tuition, with funds from the performance 
profits and scholarship endowments set up by both 
alumni and the community at large.
“By the time you get into independent donors and 
everything, it probably takes care of between one third 
and one half of our tuition,” said Snyder.
Even so, said Snyder, her time spent with the 
Tammies has been its own reward. When she gradu­
ates with a bachelor’s degree in music education, her 
career will be in teaching, she said, but her folkdance 
career will provide more than enough material to make 
her lessons more interesting.
“It’s probably been the best decision I’ve made,” she 
said. “I’ve performed for crowds of thousands and 
done things I’d never dreamed I’d do at this age, and 
I’m not even 21.”
But years ago, the university offered the 
Tamburitzans more compensation, said former 
Tamburitzan and renowned local and regional music 
educator Christine Jordanoff. When she joined the 
Tamburitzans in 1965, all 40 Tammies received full 
scholarships, room, and board. The current scholar­
ship offers may not seem as lucrative as they once did, 
she said; current Tammies often make the choice to 
join based on love alone.
“The university used to cover every aspect of their 
expenses. There was never any need for them to take 
jobs or apply for other scholarships,” she said. ‘Now, 
things have changed.”

REVIEW:The Duquesne Tamburitzans 
j Rangos Ballroom, UC Friday, October 10, 8 p.m.
Peasant dances have always been 
wild and have always attracted the 
imaginations of the world’s most impetu­
ous artists. Dutch masters Jan Brueghel and Peter 
Paul Rubens painted peasants dancing with the 
same timeless, enigmatic flair, a quality seldom 
present in the neurosis of today’s deconstructed 
performance art world. Bartok could not stop try­
ing to translate their vigor into works for the sym­
phony, many of which are still commonly recog-
— after all the years, miles 
and generations that separate them from their 
ethnic roots, American audiences still hear the 
drums of whatever land they came from, and still 
want to be spirited away.
When the Duquesne Tamburitzans brought the 
drums, the strings, the flutes, and the footwork 
to Rangos last Friday as part of the International 
Festival, they played to an audience of mostly 
Pittsburghers, who clapped along and stood to 
applaud both halves of the show. The Tammies’ 
nimble footwork, mellow voices, and expert play­
ing, along with an international-quality reper­
toire, put them in a class with few other troupes 
in the world, but for whatever reason, most stu­
dents stayed home.
They missed Dario Barisic’s rich baritone on the 
Croatian wedding epic Slavonski Svatovac and 
the classic Russian love song “Kalinka,” the furi­
ous fiddling of violin virtuosi Dana Holomshek 
and Vladimir Olexa, and Vladimir Mollov’s bril­
liant accordion variations on the traditional 
Russian tune “Chernoglaze Kazatchka.” They 
missed bouzoukis from Greece, rainbow-skirted 
karicka dances from Slovakia, and the red pom­
poms and gold coins strung from lovely Jessica 
Craig and Katia Romaniw as they sang a rich 
Macedonian duet, “Devojcence Milo Moje.” But 
most of all, students who didn’t come missed a 
chance to connect with a long-lost world.
The Tamburitzans are modern-day students 
themselves, and they came to us via a tour bus, 
but after seeing them dance, it’s tough to imagine 
them downtown, wearing windbreakers and hip 
huggers and Nikes instead of their embroidered 
Eastern European costumes, toting backpacks up 
and down the grimy hill to class. Audience mem­
bers young and old probably continue to picture 
them in golden fields, gathering grain and 
grapes, with the same mysterious smiles on their 
faces — and that may be the greatest trick of all.

HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21- April 19): Your close relationship with Mother Earth will be 
misinterpreted by Father Time, making you a despised homewrecker, and pos­
sibly splitting the universe in half.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): A 15-minute game of Candyland will miracu­
lously restore your joie de vivre, only for it to be zapped again when you lose 
Chutes and Ladders to the 7-year-old you are babysitting.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Tomorrow’s chocolate 
overdose, though gastronomically upsetting, will 
not cause any significant change in your chocolate 
consumption.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Finally replacing the 
rubber bands on your guitar with actual nylon 
strings will not improve your performance much, 
but will -definitely decrease both the number of per­
formance artists who hit on you and the speed at 
which elderly women scramble past you on the 
sidewalk.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): A rift will develop in the relationship between you 
and your beta fish after you get fed up with its non- 
communicative, less-than-bubbly personality.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): A flurry of 
angry letter-writing will result when you begin to 
notice striking similarities between different 
brands of bottled drinking water in their viscosity 
and clear, flavorless liquidness.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): While you 
know the Carnegie Mellon recycle bins can only 
handle plastic types 1 and 2, you will be unable to 
control yourself from throwing in a type 6 plastic fork from your lunch this 
Wednesday.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Tomorrow, you will notice for the first 
time that your feet are different sizes and wonder how long they’ve been like 
that without you realizing it. You will then secretly hope that you just banged 
one into a wall again and the condition is temporary, fearful that no one will 
be attracted to an asymmetrically footed (but otherwise fine-quality) creature 
such as yourself.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): While you may not be able to 
become a secret agent, your slyness and appreciation for deception will still 
be of use when you become the number one 
sought-after Bar Mitzvah reception magician this 
side of the Allegheny.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): What 
you will come down with this week is neither dead­
ly nor contagious. Your roommate, however...
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): You will 
remain in the hospital for a week to be treated for 
smoke inhalation after you are unable to decide 
whether to rescue your rice-cooker or goldfish, 
pausing at the wrong moment to wonder how well 
Speedy could fend for herself in the blaze.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Thursday night, you will swing from the 
rooftops, chase the evildoer to her secret lair, and destroy it without harming 
a fly, saving the unsuspecting city yet again. Then you will do your statistics 
homework.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imagine the shock of one who had based his life — his love — on 
one unshakable belief, only to have that simple truth pulled out from \ 
beneath him like the floor on the Gravitron or other similiar amuse- ^ 
ment park ride based on the wonders of centrifugal force. Rupert felt 
that same kind of betrayed queasiness after Amy’s surprising revela­
tion. His heart had sunk to the bottom of White’s Pond, and his trembling chin had 
dropped almost as far. At seeing Rupert’s dismay, Amy put her... er, his wing around 
Rupert in an attempt to console him, only to be pushed away. The hurt look in 
Ruperts eyes made it apparent that Amy was obliged to give an explanation. Amy 
took a long, deep breath, exhaled slowly, and began his tale...

The Green Arrow meets the silver screen
Since the breakout success of Marvel’s X-Men movie 
in 2000, comic book superheroes have seen a resur­
gence of popularity in the movie industry. Other 
recent success stories include Spider-Man and 
Daredevil — also Marvel Comics characters. Warner 
Bros., parent company of DC Comics, had fantastic 
success in the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s with the 
Superman and Batman film franchises. To the sur­
prise of fans and many moviegoers, Warner Bros, 
has been laying low and holding back on their 
superhero properties.
Until now. The company has taken a nod from the 
success of Daredevil, who was only a second-tier 
hero in the Marvel Universe. DC Comics and 
Warner Bros, are now in the production stage of 
their next comic book film franchise. The hero is 
none other than Seattle’s avenging archer, Green 
Arrow.
The news comes as a shock to many comics fanboys 
and film buffs. But to director Kevin Reynolds, the 
decision was never in doubt: “When I met with 
Warner Bros., they pretty much gave me free rein to 
choose whatever DC character I wanted. I told 
them, ‘I don’t even have to think about that.’ Hands 
down — the Green Arrow.”
After selecting the character, the next major deci­
sion was whom to cast in the title role. Many fans 
believed Reynolds would gravitate towards Kevin 
Costner, his directing partner for Waterworld and 
the star of Reynolds’ breakout film Robin Hood: 
Prince of Thieves. But Costner was under contract 
for other projects, and Warner Bros, was demand­
ing a fresh take on the character.
Many actors across the country answered the open 
casting call. Even ex-Steelers quarterback Neil 
O’Donnell tried out for the role of the Green 
Arrow’s alter-ego, Oliver Queen. O’Donnell 
approached the part with great optimism: “I figured 
Chris O’Donnell played the role of Robin in the 
Batman movies, so why can’t Neil O’Donnell be the 
Green Arrow?” Unfortunately, O’Donnell was cut 
from casting in the final stages.
Reynolds decided on an established actor that 
would give star power to the role: Cuba Gooding Jr. 
The decision shook up a diehard community of 
Green Arrow fans who were used to comic books 
which depicted a white man as the masked vigi­
lante. Reynolds explained the decision: “I picked 
Cuba for the role because I wanted a new take on
the character. Sort of like the black Jesus. Whatever 
artist did that, I thought it was really cool.”
Casting continues as Reynolds attempts to find the 
best actor for each role. In yet another surprising 
twist for fans, Andy Dick was chosen to play Green 
Arrow’s sidekick, Quiver.
Reynolds insists that Dick is delivering his most 
serious work to date, and that viewers will under­
stand the casting decision. For the most part, how­
ever, the film is relatively un-cast.
Since the studio is unusually tight-lipped about the 
details of the story, Internet gossip remains vague. 
Until recently, one big question remained unan­
swered.
Reynolds appeased followers at a press conference: 
“You ask me, ‘Why did I pick the Green Arrow?’
He’s always had this sort of masked homosexuality. 
It’s like he came out of the closet without ever really 
coming out. I respect that in a man. And a charac­
ter.”
