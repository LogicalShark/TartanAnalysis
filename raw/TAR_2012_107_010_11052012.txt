Unraveling the activites fee: Where does your money go?
ANNA WALSH 
Personnel Manager
When considering the sub-
mitted organization budgets 
last spring, the Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC) had to sort 
through over $1.6 million in 
requests. The committee only 
ended up allocating $1.12 mil-
lion, meaning that it had to 
tighten restrictions on what 
could be funded — and one of 
the costs that didn’t make the 
cut was spring break trips.
For Alternative Break, a 
student group that plans ser-
vice-based trips, JFC’s deci-
sion “was a huge blow,” said 
Sabrina Larkin, the club’s 
president and a junior chemi-
cal engineering and engineer-
ing and public policy double 
major. The organization re-
quested over $18,000 from 
JFC, but only received $204.
This stretching of resourc-
es is the reason that Student 
Body Vice President for Fi-
nance Jon Mark is proposing 
a $24 increase per semester 
to the student activities fee. 
“The programming supported 
by the fee has essentially out-
grown resources that we can 
give it,” he said at a town hall 
meeting about the activities 
fee, held last Thursday. “A lot 
of these organizations have 
come up to us and told us that 
the funding that we’re giving 
them, considering the rate 
of in?ation [and] the rate of 
what we’ve been having to cut 
them, they just can’t keep up, 
and they certainly can’t grow.”
The fee increase, which 
would go into effect next aca-
demic year, will go up for a ref-
erendum vote this Thursday 
through Saturday. The vote 
is split into two referendums: 
one to raise the undergradu-
ate fee, and one to raise the 
graduate fee.
However, when one con-
siders that the activities fee 
this year collected over $2.4 
million, it raises the question: 
Where does all that money go?
The source of the money
Carnegie Mellon’s Board 
of Trustees sets the activities 
fee every year, taking into ac-
count recommendations from 
student government. The fee 
is currently $97 per semester. 
Over the past several years, 
the fee has increased at an 
average rate of 2.4 percent. 
According to Mark, a senior 
lighting design major, student 
government has made its rec-
ommendations for increases 
based on the ?ve-year average 
of the Consumer Price Index, 
which tracks prices of various 
household goods in order to 
measure in?ation.
According to its ?scal pol-
icy, student government is al-
lowed to recommend up to a 
5 percent increase in the fee 
without needing to call a ref-
erendum for students to vote 
on the increase.
But Student Body President 
Will Weiner, an economics 
and statistics and decision sci-
ence double major, explained 
at the town hall meeting, “One 
of our fears last year when we 
thought about [doing] the 5 
percent [increase] is that if you 
do that over ?ve years, a lot of 
the students may not necessar-
ily notice. It’s de?nitely harder 
to PR that and make sure we’re 
really re?ecting what people 
want, so I think in terms of 
transparency and getting the 
proper feedback all at once, 
[the 25 percent increase] is a 
better solution.”
The Graduate Student 
Assembly
Once the Hub collects the 
funds for the activities fee, the 
money goes to different places 
depending on who it’s from. 
The graduate students’ activi-
ties fee is divided and sent to 
three different locations: 30 
percent goes to JFC’s funds, 45 
percent goes to the Graduate 
Student Assembly (GSA), and 
25 percent goes back to the 
departments for students to 
distribute.
Although the percentage of 
the graduate students’ fee that 
goes toward JFC funds is lower 
than the percentage of the un-
dergraduate fee, the GSA Vice 
President for Finance Patrick 
Foley, a Ph.D. candidate in 
statistics, believes that gradu-
ate students do not bene?t as 
Students seek voter pledges

Due to interest in student 
rights and advocacy on cam-
pus, Carnegie Mellon will 
found the ?rst chapter of the 
Student Public Interest Re-
search Groups (PIRGs) orga-
nization in the state of Penn-
sylvania.
Student PIRGs is a student-
funded, nonpartisan, and 
nonpro?t organization that 
“gives students the skills and 
opportunity to practice effec-
tive citizenship,” according to 
the Student PIRGs website. 
Representatives from Stu-
dent PIRGs have set up tables 
on campus since the begin-
ning of this school year in or-
der to encourage students to 
register to vote. 
The student interest gar-
nered from tabling became 
the basis for a Carnegie Mel-
lon chapter of the organiza-
tion. 
Satvika Neti, a ?rst-year in 
the Science and Humanities 
Scholars program and head 
of Carnegie Mellon’s Student 
PIRG chapter, helped to start 
the club because although she 
wants to vote, she will not be 
of voting age this fall.
Neti said, “Even though I 
won’t be able to vote in this 
election, I’m still really invest-
ed in it. So I wanted to make 
sure that other people had the 
chance that I wouldn’t, and I 
feel that by helping people to 
vote, I’m doing much more 
than I would with my one vote 
anyway.”
The Student PIRG club 
consists of around 30 mem-
bers, ranging from ?rst-years 
to seniors. 
They are currently focus-
ing on the new voters project 
until the election and then 
will focus on social initiatives, 
including equal rights for 
women and the decreasing of 
textbook rates and tuition.
Bradley Hodge, an unde-
clared ?rst-year in the Carn-
egie Institute of Technology, 
did not originally intend to 
vote. 
However, with Student 
PIRGs, he became interested 
and began to get involved.
Hodge said, “Sometimes 
you don’t care because you 
think, ‘My vote’s not going 
to matter,’ but especially for 
Pennsylvania, as a swing 
state, it’s really important. 
You see these old guys in 
government and you think, 
‘They’re not in tune with my 
ideas and they’re not going to 
be able to represent me,’ but if 
you get students out in force, 
you can get them to be a driv-
ing force for what they want 
in government.”
According to Daniel Walk-
er-Murray, a campus organiz-
er for Student PIRGs, youth 
voter turnout has increased 
by about 21 percent since the 
last presidential election, and 
the number of students who 
claim they are intellectually 
involved with the election has 
increased by 13 percent. 
Neti cited progress with 
student rights as a reason for 
this increased voting interest 
among college students.
“If we want more federal 
funding for student loans, we 
have to let them know. If we 
want to change the world, we 
have to let them know to start 
listening to us. One way to do 
that is by voting,” she said.
Walker-Murray said that 
Student PIRGs stopped the 
doubling of student inter-
est rates in Pennsylvania and 
helped to pass the Student 
Aid and Fiscal Responsibility 
Act that will add $36 billion 
into the Pell grant program.
From Walker-Murray’s 
perspective, this progress 
shows that the Student PIRGs 
“are a force to be reckoned 
with.... If we just organize 
ourselves and can channel all 
of our thoughts and energy in 
the right direction, and once 
you give [students] the tools 
they need to do these things, 
it’s really incredible what they 
can do.”
For the past few weeks, the 
Student PIRGs chapter has set 
up tables on the Cut in order 
to encourage students to sign 
voter pledges. 
Students can sign a card 
promising to text their friends 
reminding them to vote.
Neti said the three-part 
system of voter pledging — 
which includes signing a card, 
calling by phone, and texting 
— is new this year, and she 
hopes that it will encourage 
students to go out to the polls.
“We are having some 
phone bank blitzes this week-
end to continue contacting 
the student body because we 
found through our research 
that students are more likely 
to show up to the polls by 
four percentage points if they 
receive text messages from 
someone they know,” Walker-
Murray said. 
Compared to other col-
lege campuses which Student 
PIRGs has reached out to, 
Carnegie Mellon was leading 
the nation for a few weeks in 
the number of voters regis-
tered on campus.
“We were beating schools 
out that had six times the 
number of people that we 
had,” Walker-Murray said. 
“Carnegie Mellon has 
about 6,000 people, and we 
had organizers at the Univer-
sity of Texas at Dallas that has 
about 36,000 students, and 
obviously toward the end of 
the student drive they beat us 
out, but we got a lot of people 
interested in volunteering 
to spread the word to their 
peers.”
Student PIRGs across the 
country have a 40-year his-
tory of advocating for stu-
dents, the environment, and 
consumers, according to the 
PennPIRGs website.
Walker-Murray said, “The 
end goal of our organization 
is to ?nd the things that stu-
dents care the most about on 
campus and then work to or-
ganize them, and have repre-
sentatives in the capitals so 
that they can have their voice 
heard not only on the school 
level but on a state level. We 
can start to make real changes 
for these people.”

As election season draws 
to a close, the candidates for 
the presidency are making 
their last speeches in the 11 
battleground states that will 
decide which candidate gains 
the 270 votes necessary to 
win the election and goes on 
to occupy the Oval Of?ce this 
January.
There are a total of 538 
electoral votes at play in the 
presidential election. In order 
to be elected president, a can-
didate must win a majority of 
the votes — in other words, at 
least 270.
Electoral votes are allotted 
based on the popular vote in 
each state. A state has a cer-
tain number of electoral votes 
apportioned by population; 
the candidate who wins the 
popular vote in each state 
wins all of that state’s popu-
lar votes (except for the few 
states that allow split elec-
toral votes). In this electoral 
cycle, there are a surprisingly 
large number of states that 
are considered toss-ups.
The 11 battleground states 
in which both President 
Barack Obama and Republi-
can candidate Mitt Romney 
stand a chance of winning are 
New Hampshire, with four 
electoral votes; Iowa and Ne-
vada, with six electoral votes 
each; Colorado, with nine 
electoral votes; Wisconsin, 
with 10 electoral votes; Vir-
ginia, with 13 electoral votes; 
North Carolina, with 15 elec-
toral votes; Michigan, with 
16 electoral votes; Ohio, with 
18 electoral votes; Pennsylva-
nia, with 20 electoral votes; 
and Florida, with 29 electoral 
votes.
The other 39 states are 
fairly reliable to go either 
Republican or Democrat, 
leaving Obama with a virtu-
ally guaranteed 201 electoral 
votes, and Romney with 191. 
The battle for the presidency 
lies in the battleground states’ 
collective 146 electoral votes.
Obama won the 2008 
election with 365 electoral 
votes; he swept the battle-
ground states, including the 
traditionally red Indiana, 
North Carolina, and Virginia. 
This year, however, the race 
is much closer. Romney has 
seen positive poll data in the 
traditionally blue Michigan, 
Minnesota, and Pennsylva-
nia; meanwhile, Florida and 
Ohio remain as important 
now as they have been in past 
years.
The political aggregator 
site RealClearPolitics averag-
es poll data from many local 
and national political polls. 
According to the site’s aver-
aged polls, Obama is up 1.5 
percent in New Hampshire, 
2.5 percent in Iowa, 2.8 per-
cent in Nevada, 0.6 percent 
in Colorado, 5 percent in Wis-
consin, 4 percent in Michigan, 
2.8 percent in Ohio, and 4.1 
percent in Pennsylvania; and 
Romney is up 0.3 percent in 
Virginia, 3.8 percent in North 
Carolina, and 1.4 percent in 
Florida.
If the averages given by  
RealClearPolitics represented 
actual popular vote totals, 
Obama would take 290 elec-
toral votes and Romney 248, 
giving Obama the presidency. 
Even if Obama lost the two 
states where the poll results

much from the organizations 
on campus. In a survey stu-
dent government conducted 
last year, “they asked organi-
zations how many members 
they had who were grads and 
undergrads, and then they 
asked them, ‘In your opinion, 
do you serve mostly grads, 
mostly undergrads, or a mix?’ 
And they also asked, ‘Who do 
you bene?t in addition to the 
members of your organiza-
tion?’ ” Foley said. “And what I 
did was I took the JFC budgets 
and matched them up to the 
survey answers.”
At the town hall meeting, 
Mark said that 30 percent of 
the participants in organiza-
tions were graduate students, 
but Foley believes that number 
is not an accurate representa-
tion of graduate student ben-
e?t from the activities fee.
“My main issue with that 
is that that 30 percent num-
ber doesn’t actually re?ect the 
dollars that come out of JFC,” 
Foley said. “And if you match 
up the members or the bene?-
ciaries of organizations with 
what they’re actually getting, 
you’ll ?nd that grad students 
get something closer to like, 16 
— or at highest, 20 — percent 
of the dollars.”
A fee raise would mean 
more money would go toward 
GSA; however, research con-
ducted by a member of the Na-
tional Association of Graduate 
and Professional Students sug-
gested that Carnegie Mellon’s 
GSA is already one of the best-
funded graduate student gov-
ernments in the country.
GSA’s budget of $416,631 
covers graduate student social 
events; subsidized tickets for 
rafting, Kennywood, and mov-
ies; funds for graduate stu-
dents to attend academic con-
ferences; GSA sports teams; 
and research grants, among 
other expenses. Andy Schultz, 
a Ph.D. candidate in materials 
science and engineering and 
a current GSA representative, 
said, “We don’t need more 
money.” 
When asked if he was in fa-
vor of the activities fee raise, 
Foley said, “I can’t speak for 
all of GSA — and I don’t — but 
personally, no, I’m not in favor 
of it.”
Student Senate
Unlike the graduate stu-
dents’ activities fee, only 10 
percent of the undergradu-
ates’ student activities fee 
goes to Student Senate. Those 
funds go toward Senate’s vari-
ous committees (Academic 
Affairs, Business Affairs, Cam-
pus Life, Communications, Fi-
nance, and Internal Develop-
ment), as well as to funding 
events like Senate Week. Sen-
ate also pays for 25 percent 
of the Arts Pass program, and 
helps to cover the salary of stu-
dent government’s application 
engineer, sophomore informa-
tion systems and computer sci-
ence double major Carlos Di-
az-Padron, who is responsible 
for the maintenance and up-
keep of student government’s 
various websites.
Most of Senate’s budget, 
however, ends up going to 
student organizations. Ac-
cording to the Student Sen-
ate policy, at least 25 percent 
of Senate’s budget is required 
to go toward special alloca-
tions funding, which provides 
“?nancial support for events 
and organizations that bene?t 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
undergraduate students.” 
Special allocations are 
meant to fund events that are 
new to Carnegie Mellon, costs 
that arise unexpectedly after 
budgets have been approved, 
and groups that are not fund-
ed by JFC. This academic 
year, Senate has set aside over 
$70,000, 61.4 percent of its 
budget, to go toward special 
allocations.
JFC funds
The vast majority of under-
graduates’ student activities 
fee — 90 percent of it — goes 
into the pool of JFC’s funds. 
Between the undergraduate 
portion and the 30 percent 
from graduate students, ap-
proximately $1.12 million is 
available this year for student 
organizations. If both activi-
ties fee referendums pass in 
this week’s special election, an 
additional $314,000 will go to-
ward JFC’s funds.
During the spring semes-
ter, student organizations ap-
ply to JFC with budgets for 
the following academic year 
that state the speci?c items 
their budget will go toward. 
Every student organization is 
assigned a JFC representative 
who is supposed to answer 
their questions and walk them 
through the process. Once JFC 
reviews the budget and makes 
its recommendations, the 
organizations each have the 
opportunity to appeal JFC’s 
recommendations. JFC then 
submits its ?nal budget recom-
mendations for every organi-
zation to Student Senate and 
GSA, which make a decision 
on every budget near the end 
of April.
JFC distributes its funds 
based on the guidelines in its 
bylaws; its own decisions on 
how much the committee will 
contribute to cover speci?c 
types of budget requests, like 
food or travel expenses; and 
its impression of how much 
each organization contributes 
to the campus community.
The system, however, is not 
without ?aws. “I think that 
[the JFC process] needs to 
fundamentally change,” Mark 
said in an interview. He cited 
outdated metrics as one prob-
lem — for example, JFC only 
gives $60 per night to cover 
hotel expenses, but “it’s really 
hard to ?nd a $60 hotel room 
and ?t four people in it. And 
that’s the current expecta-
tion,” Mark said.
Schultz, who sat on JFC 
last year, said JFC is “such a 
big, large process that it’s re-
ally dif?cult to be consistent 
across all the groups, and it’s 
really dif?cult to try and ?nd 
a way to objectively look at 
which groups actually serve 
the community best and de-
serve the money they’re get-
ting.” He said, “What happens 
is, essentially for every group 
— and with very rare excep-
tions in the last year, this is 
how it goes — you look at 
what they’re asking, you look 
at what their budget was last 
year, and you cut them down 
to 5 percent increase.”
Mark also said that JFC’s 
reliance on previous budgets 
is ?awed. “It makes things re-
ally unfair.... Organizations 
who have historically had 
large budgets and groups that 
have not historically had large 
budgets [are] kind of staying 
around the status quo.”
JFC’s bylaws also make it 
dif?cult for new organizations 
to grow. Organizations that 
are applying for a budget for 
the ?rst time cannot receive 
more than $500, which, for 
new buggy team Apex, is far 
from suf?cient.
“As a buggy organization, 
$500 will literally get us noth-
ing,” said Connor Hayes, a 
second-year architecture ma-
jor and chairman for Apex. 
The organization applied for 
$3,970 from JFC, but since 
this was Apex’s ?rst year as an 
organization, it only received 
$500. “It seems like the way 
that they fund certain organi-
zations does not re?ect what 
we can logically do. Buggy’s 
a very time-consuming thing, 
so to expect us to raise a lot of 
money — on top of being an 
organization that does what 
we’re doing — it’s not exactly 
a feasible thing, especially for 
a smaller organization that 
doesn’t have the manpower of 
the bigger organizations.”
It didn’t help that they 
never received guidance from 
their JFC representative. “Our 
JFC rep did not contact us one 
time,” Hayes said. “I reached 
out to him, and I was never 
given a response in return.”
Mark agreed that JFC rep-
resentatives are not always 
useful to organizations, which 
is why he wants to do “more 
training for JFC reps, really 
making sure that they have the 
training that they need to do 
their job and to make sure that 
the process is clear for student 
organizations.”
Schultz, however, said that 
there was another reason why 
the JFC was sometimes inef-
fective: Some of the larger 
organizations will ensure that 
someone from their staff is on 
JFC, so “there were certain 
JFC reps [last year] that just 
didn’t go to meetings, and they 
were there to speak for their 
groups” that they were in-
volved in, rather than to help 
the organizations which they 
were assigned to represent, he 
said.
For instance, the Activities 
Board (AB) — which is techni-
cally a standing committee of 
the student government, rath-
er than a student organization 
— usually ensures that an AB 
member is on JFC “that can 
make sure that they get their 
money, that can ?ght in the 
room,” Schultz said. Last year, 
one of AB Committee chairs 
sat on JFC.
Ariel Liu, the executive 
chair for AB and a senior com-
puter science major, said, “I 
think that, because AB con-
stitutes a large portion of the 
budget, that it’s important for 
JFC to recognize how we use 
that budget, and if there isn’t 
someone from AB who is on 
JFC ... they won’t be able to 
see all the different things that 
AB does.”
Mark also indicated that 
organizations often overspend 
or misspend parts of their bud-
get, citing an example of one 
organization that overspent 
on its food budget by 1,000 
percent. One of his priorities 
is therefore going to be “mak-
ing sure that groups are really 
doing what they say they’re 
doing,” he said. “There should 
be transparency between the 
JFC and the people that need 
to interact with it, so the fact 
that people feel that they can’t 
be transparent in order to get 
what they need to operate, 
that’s bad. So we need to ?g-
ure out a way to ?x that.”
Activities fee raise
Given the problems the cur-
rent JFC process has, “I think 
JFC needs a major overhaul on 
the whole process,” Schultz 
said. While he acknowledged 
that many of JFC’s problems 
are “dif?cult problems” that 
may not even have solutions, 
“I don’t see a reason to give 
JFC more money until they 
can ?gure out how to better 
allocate the money that they 
have now and [can] actually 
show that that process isn’t as 
?awed as it is now.”
But Mark said that through 
the changes he wants to imple-
ment, JFC will be better able 
“to leverage dollars in a way 
to create the most impact.” He 
said he wants to “take a look at 
the system and do an overhaul 
?rst. But especially if we have 
more money coming into the 
system, we really need to do 
this; we really need to look at 
how we’re doing this and kind 
of take a step back.”
Larkin is optimistic about 
the fee increase. “I don’t think 
it can be a bad thing,” she 
said. “It doesn’t seem like a 
lot to me. Our organization in 
particular, if they can get that 
extra funding coming in, and 
the activities fee increase is 
something that can help along 
with that, it would make the 
overall experience much more 
positive for myself and for all 
of the participants.”
In the meantime, she is 
staying positive for Alterna-
tive Break’s budget this year. 
Although the JFC’s cuts were a 
loss, “we knew that [it would 
be cut] coming into making 
the budget, and we’re hoping 
that we have accounted for 
that, that we’ll have enough 
fundraising to make up for 
that at the end of the year.”
JFC process ?awed, say student government insiders
from RealClearPolitics has 
him winning — New Hamp-
shire and Colorado — he 
would retain 277 electoral 
votes and win the election. 
The New York Times politi-
cal blogger Nate Silver said 
in a post on Saturday that in 
order for Romney to win the 
electoral college, state polls 
would have to be system-
atically oversampling Obama 
voters.
One interesting caveat in 
this presidential election is 
the possibility of an electoral 
college tie. Several possible 
scenarios can leave both can-
didates with a total of 269 
electoral votes. If Romney can 
win Florida, North Carolina, 
Virginia, Iowa, Colorado, and 
Nevada, he’ll be one shy of 
270. Similarly, Romney could 
lose Virginia, but win Flor-
ida, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Wisconsin, and either Iowa 
or Nevada for the same tied 
scenario. Silver considered 
the scenario in which both 
Romney and Obama win 269 
electoral votes to have a 0.2 
percent chance of happening.
If no candidate wins a ma-
jority of the votes, the House 
of Representatives votes for 
the President from among the 
three highest-voted candi-
dates, and the Senate choos-
es the Vice President from 
among the two highest-voted 
vice presidential candidates. 
Each Senator casts one vote, 
but the House of Representa-
tives votes in blocs by state. 
Each representative casts a 
vote, and the most popular 
candidate among the delega-
tion from each state wins that 
state’s vote.
If the House vote ends 
in a tie, the 20th Amend-
ment speci?es that the vice 
president-elect takes of?ce. If 
both the House and the Sen-
ate votes end in ties, federal 
law speci?es a successive list 
of people who should take of-
?ce, starting with the Speaker 
of the House.
In the history of the U.S., 
only John Quincy Adams 
has ever been elected by the 
House of Representatives.
There is also the possibility 
that a “faithless elector” could 
shake up the count. An elector 
is a person who represents a 
state in the Electoral College. 
Electors cast the actual votes 
that determine the President. 
Different states appoint their 
electors differently, and not 
all states legally require elec-
tors to vote for the candidate 
who won the state’s popular 
vote. A faithless elector is an 
elector who votes against the 
will of his or her state’s popu-
lar vote.
Faithless electors are rela-
tively rare; the most recent 
instance was in 2004, and 
in the 20th and 21st centu-
ries, no election has ever had 
more than one. In addition, 
some states have laws that 
invalidate the votes of faith-
less electors. Unless the race 
is already extremely close, 
faithless electors are unlikely 
to impact the outcome.
There is  the possibility of a 
disparity between the elector-
al vote and the popular vote, 
as in 2000. Silver places the 
odds of Obama winning the 
popular vote and losing the 
electoral vote at 1.1 percent, 
and vice-versa at 5.7 percent. 
If the election had been held 
just a few days ago, according 
to the RealClearPolitics aver-
ages, Romney would have 
won the popular vote, but lost 
the electoral vote.
All electoral math and 
possible constitutional crises 
aside, the race will probably 
come down to Ohio. Silver 
has Ohio with a 50 percent 
chance of being the deciding 
state, far more likely than Vir-
ginia, the next highest, at 15 
percent. Once Ohio’s votes 
are tallied, it seems likely that 
the U.S. will know who its 
next President will be.

Carnegie Mellon wel-
comed two 20 Under 20 Thiel 
Fellowship ?nalists into its 
class of ?rst-years this fall. 
Obawole Idowu in the Carn-
egie Institute of Technology 
and Vijay Viswanathan in the 
Mellon College of Science 
spent four days in San Fran-
cisco this summer competing 
for a $100,000 fellowship; the 
competition is chronicled in 
the second season of the pop-
ular CNBC show 20 Under 20: 
Transforming Tomorrow.
Although neither won 
the grand prize, Idowu and 
Viswanathan still have a lot to 
boast about. Each has already 
accomplished more research 
than many Carnegie Mellon 
undergraduates in their re-
spective ?elds.
For his presentation in the 
Lightning Pitch round of the 
competition, 15-year-old Id-
owu said, “My goal is to be dis-
ruptive in providing access to 
mobile technology.” His idea? 
A self-powering pair of smart-
phone sunglasses called Soul 
Aurum. The glasses would 
use solar array lenses and in-
duction from coils wrapped 
around the frame, with an 
alloy that would change mag-
netic properties in warm cli-
mates.
This use of temperature 
and sun for power would 
make this type of technology 
ideal for its target audience: 
the mobile markets in Afri-
ca, Latin America, and Asia, 
where most of the world’s 1.5 
billion people without elec-
tricity or internet live.
The topic of self-sustain-
ing, mobile technology in-
spires Idowu not as a business 
strategy, but as an opportu-
nity to do something good for 
the world. The reason he is 
interested in mobile devices 
that support the internet is 
because more people can be 
connected online and “share 
their ideas about how they 
can change the world,” he 
said.
Allowing those without 
easy access to electricity to 
have smartphone devices 
would provide them with 
more than just the advantages 
one takes for granted every-
day. As Idowu explained, the 
bene?t of communication is 
critical for the quality of life.
Such movements could 
have huge impacts on indi-
viduals in ?elds of business 
and medicine. Asha Thomas, 
a senior double majoring in 
business administration and 
global studies, agreed. From 
her three trips to underdevel-
oped communities in Panama 
with Carnegie Mellon’s Glob-
al Business Brigades, she ex-
perienced ?rsthand the type 
of environments that would 
bene?t most from technolo-
gies like Soul Aurum.
“In all of the communities 
we visited, they had sparse 
electricity, if any at all,” she 
said. “One of the communi-
ties did have their few lights 
running on solar power, so 
that fact puts me at ease when 
thinking about the adop-
tion of this technology in the 
communities.” It’s areas like 
these in Panama that Idowu 
hopes to help with further 
research.
Viswanathan’s research 
also has large goals. In a pre-
sentation he made called 
“Developing a Computational 
Model of Blood Platelet Mor-
phology with Fluid Dynamics 
Applications,” Viswanathan 
described his work in creating 
geometric and 3-D computer 
models of blood platelets.
One of the problems with 
treating blood platelet dis-
orders is that while much is 
known about the disorders 
on a chemical level, little is 
known about them physical-
ly. How they travel through 
blood is a ?uid dynamics 
problem, and Viswanathan 
hopes that his 3-D models can 
help solve it.
One of the most prominent 
features of his model is its 
ability to calculate the coef-
?cient of drag on a platelet. 
Drag is the resistive force of 
?uid — in this case blood —
on a body as it moves; if two 
platelets have different drag 
coef?cients, it means they 
have two different shapes. 
Blood platelets from two peo-
ple could be different because 
of the presence of disease or 
even just from genetic varia-
tions.
“I can see a future of medi-
cine which can become ‘per-
sonalized medicine’ and that 
could really save lives, be-
cause no two people are the 
same, and medicine should 
evolve to meet that,” Viswa-
nathan said. “With simula-
tions, that is much more do-
able than it is right now, and 
I believe that with my work, 
hematological problems deal-
ing with blood issues can be 
solved in that way.”

The GPS, or Global Posi-
tioning System, is an ef?cient 
tool that one may utilize for 
myriad causes. It is an ubiq-
uitous object that is able to 
identify a current location 
and destination, give direc-
tions, and calculate the time 
and distance of a journey. 
How does such a small object 
complete such complex tasks?
Broadly, the GPS func-
tion is supported by clocks, 
signals, and mathematical 
concepts. The GPS system in-
volves the receiver as well as 
27 Earth-orbiting satellites, 
three of which are backups 
in case one fails. According 
to howstuffworks.com, the 
satellites rotate around the 
Earth twice a day so that dif-
ferent sets of at least four sat-
ellites are visible through a 
telescope at all times and in 
all places. The GPS receiver 
calculates a speci?c point on 
Earth by analyzing radio sig-
nals from GPS satellites.
Through 3-D trilateration, 
a mathematical principle that 
involves overlapping areas, 
the GPS can identify its cur-
rent location by relying on its 
distance from a relative point 
on Earth and from at least 
three satellites. Because a sat-
ellite cannot determine the 
exact direction it receives the 
signal from a GPS, a sphere of 
possible locations is created, 
with the radius being the dis-
tance between the GPS and 
the satellite. So if a GPS con-
nects with three or four satel-
lites, four spheres of possible 
locations are generated. The 
intersection of these spheres 
on Earth is the location of the 
GPS.
But how does the GPS cal-
culate the distance from the 
receiver to the satellite? The 
satellite contains an atomic 
clock that can be synchronized 
to the nanosecond, while the 
receiver contains a household 
clock that constantly resets. 
Because the household clock 
in the receiver initially makes 
proportionally incorrect time 
measurements using its own 
clock, the receiver resets and 
syncs with the satellite's cor-
rect time. Syncing to a correct 
time causes all received sig-
nals to align at a single point 
in space, which causes the 
other three satellites to have 
the same time.
After syncing, the satellite 
transmits a pseudo-random 
code, or a digital pattern, and 
the receiver begins running 
the same pattern. As the sat-
ellite’s signal reaches the 
receiver, transmission lags 
behind the receiver’s pattern 
run. The receiver determines 
its distance from the satellite 
by multiplying the lag by the 
speed of light.
To use the distance in-
formation, the GPS receiver 
refers to an internal almanac 
that records every satellite po-
sition at any given time. Any 
slight changes in the satellite 
orbit will be corrected and 
sent to the receivers by the 
Department of Defense.
Despite the intricate pro-
cesses that appear to guaran-
tee accuracy, satellites some-
times transmit unclear signals 
and faulty almanac informa-
tion. In those cases, a Differ-
ential GPS (DGPS) — which 
is separate from the ones that 
everyday people use — iden-
ti?es inaccuracies by calculat-
ing its location via satellite 
signals at its stationary receiv-
er station, and then compares 
it to a known location.
The DGPS provides correct 
signal information by broad-
casting a radio signal from its 
station to all DGPS-equipped 
receivers in the area. As a re-
sult, those roving GPS receiv-
ers will receive signals that in-
form them of any differences 
in calculation from the DGPS 
station and correct any faulty 
information. From there, 
those DGPSs communicate 
correct signal information to 
GPSs that civilians use.
It then sends a radio sig-
nal to all DGPS-equipped 
receivers, informing them of 
correct signal information. 
In general, the GPS picks up 
transmissions from at least 
four satellites and combines 
them with information in the 
electronic almanac to ?gure 
out the receiver’s position on 
Earth. When the position is 
calculated, the GPS can tell 
users the longitude, latitude, 
and altitude of their current 
positions and future destina-
tions. 
So when you pull out your 
GPS  help you get to your rela-
tive’s house for Thanksgiving, 
you can thank complex math-
ematical principals for getting 
you where you need to be.

Carnegie Mellon’s multi-
disciplinary approach allows 
students from different ?elds 
of study to come together and 
work on projects. This past 
year, four students from the 
Carnegie Institute of Technol-
ogy and the Mellon College of 
Science joined forces to par-
ticipate in the International 
Genetically Engineered Ma-
chine (iGEM) Competition. 
The group enjoyed success at 
the regional level held in Pitts-
burgh and was selected as one 
of the four teams out of 43 to 
advance to the competition’s 
international jamboree this 
past weekend in Cambridge, 
Mass.
The team, which came to-
gether last October, consists 
of sophomore electrical and 
computer engineering and 
biomedical engineering dou-
ble major Peter Wei; senior 
electrical and computer engi-
neering and biomedical en-
gineering double major Jesse 
Salazar; sophomore biological 
sciences major Eric Pederson; 
and junior chemical engineer-
ing and biomedical engineer-
ing double major Yang Choo.
Their instructors were 
Cheemeng Tan, a post-doc-
toral fellow with the Ray and 
Stephanie Lane Center for 
Computational Biology, and 
Natasa Miskov-Zivanov, an ad-
junct faculty member with the 
department of electrical and 
computer engineering.
The iGEM competition mo-
tivates students from around 
the world to develop projects 
in synthetic biology. Pederson 
explained it as “projects that 
take parts from different or-
ganisms and mixing them to 
get what you want qualify."
After spending a month 
exploring different project 
ideas for the competition, the 
team settled on a project that 
expanded on work research-
ers at Carnegie Mellon had 
already brie?y explored. After 
securing lab time in March, 
the team ?nally got to work. 
Their research aimed to quan-
titatively measure the a cell’s 
amount of a protein that was 
discovered at Carnegie Mellon.
Pederson explained the sci-
ence behind what their project 
aimed to accomplish: “Pro-
moters are regions in our DNA 
that have regulatory functions 
that can impact what goes on 
inside our cells.” DNA codes 
for tens of thousands of pro-
teins to be made by cells, but 
only a select number of these 
proteins will be made by the 
cells at any one time. The 
controlling factors are these 
promoter regions which act 
as on and off switches that tell 
the cell when to make or stop 
making a protein depending 
on if it is needed or not.
In modern biology, re-
searchers incorporate and 
manipulate promoters in 
cells to increase or decrease 
the concentration of speci?c 
proteins to force a certain 
change within the cell. Ped-
erson compared promoters to 
the engine of a car in “how a 
mechanic wouldn’t want to 
put a Hummer engine inside 
a Prius because it would de-
stroy the chassis.” Similarly, a 
scientist wouldn’t want to use 
the wrong promoter to force a 
speci?c change in the cell be-
cause it might cause the wrong 
proteins to be made and cause 
the cell to die.
Once they had decided on a 
project, Tan and Pederson col-
lected data through ?uores-
cence microscopy, where cer-
tain dyes bind to proteins and 
glow. This allows researchers 
to use microscopes to measure 
the amount of dye present 
and subsequently determine 
how much protein is present 
in the cell. Wei explained that 
he used the data to “develop 
a quantitative measure us-
ing time course curves that 
pinpoint when all the dye has 
binded to the proteins in the 
cell.”
Currently, researchers can 
perform experiments such as 
Western Blotting and use pro-
tein puri?cation techniques 
to collect the proteins in the 
cell and measure their con-
centration. However, these 
techniques require breaking 
open the cells to collect the 
proteins. The quantitative 
measures that the Carnegie 
Mellon iGEM team developed 
to measure utilized promoters 
and dyes didn’t require killing 
the cells; Pederson believes it 
“can save scientists a lot of ex-
tra work, time, and money.”
The multidisciplinary proj-
ect allowed team members 
from a variety of backgrounds 
to get involved and contribute 
to its success. Wei said that 
before joining the project he 
had a small interest in biology, 
which motivated him to get 
involved. He felt that joining a 
project like this “was the most 
effective method to getting 
into a ?eld you know nothing 
about.”
Both Pederson and Salazar 
felt that “the competition was 
just a prologue” and they felt 
very proud of how much they 
had already accomplished.

BROOKE KUEI

When someone mentions 
robots, popular representa-
tions such as R2-D2, Wall-E, 
or the Terminator may come 
to mind. But what if scien-
tists could make robots so tiny 
they could navigate inside 
the human body? Metin Sitti, 
Carnegie Mellon professor in 
mechanical engineering and 
head of the Nanorobotics Lab, 
and Sehyuk Yim, a Ph.D. stu-
dent in mechanical engineer-
ing, recently received funding 
for their research on medical 
capsule robots. 
Pill cameras that take pic-
tures of the gastrointestinal 
tract after being swallowed 
have already been around 
for 11 years. These miniature 
cameras are FDA-approved 
and widely used in hospitals 
— but they do not have any 
functions beyond imaging.
“Imaging is good,” Sitti 
said, “but it’s a passive tab-
let you swallow that moves 
through your body naturally. 
If you miss something, you 
cannot go back. If you want to 
stay at one place longer, you 
can’t. If you want to do drug 
delivery or a biopsy, there is 
no way to do that because the 
capsule is not controlled.” 
Sitti and Yim wanted to 
engineer an active robotic cap-
sule that could be controlled 
while inside the gastrointesti-
nal tract. Some scientists uti-
lize wired endoscopes, which 
are tubes with an attached 
light source, to illuminate an 
organ. While endoscopes can 
perform camera imaging, in-
ject drugs, take tissue samples, 
and have heat probes, they are 
also highly invasive.
“We want to combine the 
advantages of wired endo-
scopes with all its functions 
and try to put that into the pill 
camera so we can have an ac-
tive pill that can do all of these 
functions in a minimally inva-
sive manner,” Sitti said. 
A popular idea in medical 
robots has been tiny rigid ro-
bots that can move inside the 
body using legs. To overcome 
the safety hazard of rigid ro-
bots, Yim decided to explore 
the idea of soft capsule robots 
made of a squishy material 
called elastomer. In addition 
to being safe inside the body, 
the shape of a soft robot can be 
easily changed. “Combining 
soft robotics with nanorobot-
ics is a novelty,” Sitti said.
Sitti and Yim designed a ro-
bot with two heads that has an 
internal magnet at each end. 
Using an external magnet at 
a certain distance away from 
the robot, the capsule can be 
remotely controlled. By using 
magnetic ?elds to contract and 
expand the soft capsule after it 
has been swallowed, the tiny 
robot can roll and twist inside 
a patient’s stomach. 
The researchers hope to 
improve this concept by in-
creasing the friction on the 
capsule’s surface — perhaps 
with adhesive ?bers inspired 
by the ?bers on geckos’ feet — 
so that it can move more easily 
on the mucus-covered stom-
ach lining.
“You can put a drug cham-
ber in the middle, and by 
changing the formation of the 
capsule, you can inject a drug,” 
Sitti said. Another function of 
the capsule is to inject biopsy 
microgrippers that come out 
and grab tissue by folding and 
contracting when exposed to 
body temperature. After the 
capsule leaves the body natu-
rally, this tissue sample can be 
taken out and examined.
The building process for 
these tiny capsule robots takes 
a high level of precision. “I use 
a molding process,” Yim said. 
“These capsule robots are 
made of polymer material, so 
we have to use a 3-D printer, 
which is a rapid prototyping 
machine that works by layer-
ing of material. Using this, we 
make a mold that I can then 
pour a polymer into. After 
seven or eight hours, the elas-
tomer is cured and I detach it 
from the mold and assemble 
the parts.”
By using this molding pro-
cess, Yim is able to make many 
copies of the capsule robot in 
an inexpensive manner.
“We haven’t yet built a full 
prototype that we can try clini-
cally on animals,” Sitti said. 
“We’ve just built prototypes 
for different functions.” With 
their new grant, Sitti and Yim 
hope to have this full prototype 
done within the next year. Af-
ter it is approved by the FDA, 
which is a long process that 
will take approximately 10 
years, Sitti and Yim can see 
their capsule robot being used 
for real-life applications. 
In the meantime, their in-
progess soft capsule robot can 
be applied as a health monitor-
ing system that works by giv-
ing the swallowed capsule the 
capability to detect what foods 
a person eats. This can bene?t 
patients that have problems 
with their digestive tract.
Scientists receive funding for medical robotics research
Tree of Life created for living bird species
Scientists have created 
a phylogenetic tree — a 
branching map of evolution-
ary relations between species 
— for all 9,993 of the world’s 
living bird species. 
“This is the ?rst dated tree 
of life for a class of species 
this size to be put on a global 
map,” said Walter Jetz, an 
evolutionary biologist at Yale 
University who participated 
in the study. However, some 
scientists are critical of the 
tree, claiming that its sheer 
magnitude allows for the ex-
trapolation of evolutionary 
trends that don’t exist. 
The tree was constructed 
based on the genetic infor-
mation of around 6,600 spe-
cies — the other 3,300 were 
grouped based on constraints 
such as genus membership.

Researchers ?nd post-adolescent cyberbullying
A recent study by United 
Kingdom researchers at the 
University of Shef?eld and 
Nottingham University re-
veals that cyberbullying still 
goes on long after adoles-
cence: It is prominent in the 
workplace as well. Out of a 
survey conducted among 320 
United Kingdom university 
employees, around eight out 
of 10 claimed to have been a 
victim of cyberbullying at least 
once in the past six months.
Another 14–20 percent 
claimed to be victims of cy-
berbullying on a weekly basis 
— a rate similar to that re-
ported by those bullied in per-
son. The researchers plan to 
release suggestions for ways 
employers can foster cyber-
bullying-free environments in 
the workplace.

MIT researchers reveal robotic arm prototype
Fans of the Spiderman su-
pervillain Doctor Octopus are 
sure to appreciate the work of 
Federico Parietti and Harry 
Asada. The two Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology 
researchers are working on 
a prototype pair of wearable 
robotic arms that will use ad-
vanced algorithms to detect 
and facilitate the intent of its 
user. The research was fund-
ed by Boeing, and the scien-
tists believe the arms could be 
very helpful to factory work-
ers or those performing com-
plex do-it-yourself tasks.
“It’s bold and out of keep-
ing with anything I’ve ever 
seen to attach two arms to a 
human,” said Dave Barrett, 
a roboticist and mechanical 
engineer at Olin College in 
Needham, Mass.

Researchers observe light from earliest stars
Astronomers at the Stan-
ford Linear Accelerator Cen-
ter in California are claiming 
they have spotted light from 
the very ?rst stars in the uni-
verse. These stars’ speci?c 
glow, known as extragalac-
tic background light (EBL), 
comes from stars that existed 
when the universe was as 
young as 600 million years 
old — very early in its exis-
tence, compared to the uni-
verse’s present age of 13.7 bil-
lion years. The scientists did 
not measure the EBL directly, 
but instead detected it by ana-
lyzing measurements made 
by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-Ray 
Space Telescope.
Stars from this period in 
the universe’s history were 
more massive and burned 
brighter than today’s stars.

Elephant in South Korea ‘speaks’ basic phrases
Koshik, an elephant living 
at the Everland Zoo in South 
Korea, is able to emulate el-
ementary Korean speech. 
By sticking his trunk into his 
mouth, Koshik is able to ut-
ter the ?ve Korean words for 
“hello,” “sit down,” “no,” “lie 
down,” and “good.” Native 
speakers of the language are 
able to understand these ut-
terances, so the elephant has 
become a popular tourist at-
traction. It is unlikely, how-
ever, that Koshik understands 
the words he says.
Although it’s unclear why 
Koshik makes the sounds, 
cognitive biologist Angela 
Stoeger believes “...that Ko-
shik started to adapt his 
vocalizations to his human 
companions to strengthen his 
social af?liation with them.”

Android running on three out of four smartphones
The industry research ?rm 
International Data Corpora-
tion (IDC) released a report 
claiming that three out of ev-
ery four smartphones runs a 
version of Google’s Android 
operating system. This is an 
increase from this time last 
year, when the statistic was 
at 57.5 percent.
“Google has a thriving, 
multifaceted product portfo-
lio. Many of its competitors, 
with weaker tie-ins to the 
mobile OS, do not,” accord-
ing to the IDC report. 
While Google widened 
the gap between rival Apple, 
most of the gains were made 
at the loss of sales by Black-
berry and Symbian.

Students, faculty, and staff found 
themselves without consistent wire-
less internet access across campus on 
Monday and Tuesday. Although both 
of the campus wireless networks — 
“CMU” and “CMU-SECURE” — were 
left on and broadcasted as available, 
neither host would assign IP ad-
dresses to computers trying to reach 
the internet. 
On a campus as technologically 
focused as Carnegie Mellon, two 
days without Wi-Fi is a signi?cant in-
convenience. 
Students with laptops or wire-
less devices need Wi-Fi on campus 
to access Blackboard and submit as-
signments. Many professors count 
on wireless internet for in-class dem-
onstrations and lecture notes. And 
almost everyone on campus uses 
wireless internet to check emails and 
follow events while on the go. 
We understand that the internet 
connection may have been knocked 
out by the inclement weather Pitts-
burgh received from Hurricane 
Sandy, and perhaps the disruption to 
campus Wi-Fi was unavoidable. 
However, the school’s silence on 
this issue has been disappointing. 
There was no acknowledgement of 
the internet issues during the inter-
net blackout and no noti?cation or 
apology afterwards. 
Nobody knew what was happen-
ing. Students did not know to buy 
ethernet cables, professors did not 
know to avoid wasting class time try-
ing to connect to the internet.
Little-to-no noti?cation has been 
sent out to students regarding the is-
sues with connecting to the internet 
on campus. 
Computing Services sent out an 
email on Sunday offering to help 
students connect their devices to the 
“CMU-SECURE” network, but the 
noti?cation never mentioned the 
connectivity issues from early last 
week.
While being without Wi-Fi for two 
days is not an emergency, the admin-
istration should not get into the prac-
tice of staying silent on campus-wide 
inconveniences. 
The collective impact across all 
of the university community war-
ranted some noti?cation about the 
knocked-out Wi-Fi.

Trump’s mid-disaster stunt for attention is despicable
Amid the wreckage wrought by 
Hurricane Sandy, Donald Trump 
still managed to make headlines. In 
a video posted on YouTube from the 
top ?oor of a Trump Tower on Oct. 
24, he offered $5 million to a char-
ity of Obama’s choice in exchange 
for the public release of the Presi-
dent’s college transcripts and pass-
port applications and records by last     
Wednesday.
Trump even had the gall to extend 
his “offer” to noon on Thursday when 
the hurricane hit, and when Obama 
didn’t respond by this deadline, 
Trump decided that, “Obviously he 
wasn’t born of this country, or, if he 
was, he said he wasn’t in order to 
receive ?nancial aid and in order to 
have a clear and very easy path into a 
college or university.”
One could step back from the ri-
diculousness of the previous state-
ment for a moment and consider 
that, not only has Trump never met 
Obama, but the President has no 
more obligation to respond Trump’s 
accusations than those made by any 
other American citizen. 
Obama is merely exercising his 
right as an American to ignore things 
he doesn’t care about. And surely 
Obama recognizes Trump’s vehe-
mence on this issue as at least 50 per-
cent publicity stunt — as does Dallas 
Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who 
on Friday offered Trump $1 million 
to shave his head.
The adage “any publicity is good 
publicity” is no longer true for 
Trump’s case, no matter how de-
voutly he lives by it. Yes, he has radi-
cal opinions on Obama, like that he 
might be an expatriate Muslim from 
Kenya. This fact doesn’t give him jus-
ti?cation to bribe the President, nor 
does his vampiric thirst to stay rel-
evant in America’s culture.
More offensive than Trump’s usu-
al publicity stunts, however, is that 
he was dangling $5 million in front 
of the President during a huge natu-
ral disaster that hit his own New York 
City. 
When Trump made his Twitter 
post moving his extortion deadline 
to Thursday, apartments and subway 
systems were ?ooding over, and peo-
ple were dying throughout New York 
and New Jersey.
If Trump had that much money 
to spare on a charity of Obama’s 
choice, then perhaps the money 
would be better spent saving the 
lives and homes of those affected by 
the hurricane.

Disney of?cials announced last 
Tuesday that the company was buy-
ing Lucas?lm for $4.05 billion and 
would release Star Wars Episode VII 
in 2015. 
Created by ?lmmaker George 
Lucas, Lucas?lm produced the Star 
Wars and Indiana Jones ?lms, in ad-
dition to running subsidiary busi-
nesses in audio and special effects. 
The acquisition of Lucas?lm pres-
ents Disney with a signi?cant oppor-
tunity. The desire to expand the Star 
Wars movie universe with another 
trilogy of ?lms may prove extremely 
pro?table and successful, but may 
also back?re. However, if these ?lms 
prove to be critical successes, they of-
fer the potential to reinvigorate the 
Star Wars brand and restore faith in 
the franchise after three disappoint-
ing prequels. 
Star Wars already suffered, not ?-
nancially, but creatively, from these 
three prequels overseen by Lucas. 
While Lucas is only slated to contrib-
ute to the new series as a creative 
consultant, any more mishandling of 
the franchise may leave a permanent 
mark on Star Wars. 
Despite the large amount of nega-
tivity and uncertainty surrounding 
this announcement, it is also impor-
tant to acknowledge that Disney has 
proved to be a successful manager of 
other well-known brands. The most 
recent example is Marvel, which 
released the Joss Whedon-directed 
The Avengers to great critical and ?-
nancial success. However, more in-
volvement on Disney’s part does not 
always result in success, as Pixar’s 
latest offerings Cars 2 and Brave re-
ceived  less favorable receptions than 
any of Pixar’s previous works. 
But Disney knows how to mar-
ket a movie. Cars 2, despite being 
the worst-reviewed Pixar ?lm, still 
turned a massive pro?t. For a fran-
chise that has had a shaky recent 
history, this marketing skill could be 
valuable. But whether it will succeed 
in producing high quality Star Wars 
?lms, however, remains to be seen.
Disney is perfectly capable of cre-
ating quality ?lms, and will reap the 
inevitable ?nancial pro?ts that will 
come from the release of a new Star 
Wars ?lm. 
Unfortunately, it remains unclear 
as to whether the company will try 
to do this or not. Let us hope that 
decent screenwriters and directors 
sign on for these movies and help 
to restore the magic of this classic 
franchise.
Americans must practice vigilance through voting 
KYLE HENSON
If I were to ever get a tattoo, it’d 
say, “Eternal vigilance is the price of 
liberty.” Nothing better sums up, in 
my mind, how crucial it is to vote in 
not only this election, but in every 
election.
Those seven words are engraved 
upon the statue of a grim Roman 
warrior sitting outside the National 
Archives in Washington, D.C. His 
left hand clutches a sword, his right 
hand holds a helmet, and a lion’s pelt 
drapes over his arm — all to convey 
that power must be checked at ev-
ery turn by a diligent and watchful 
public.
I contend that, at every turn, 
we have failed to check the powers 
we’ve granted government. Only 
about two-thirds of our voting-age 
population shows up to vote every 
four years, and even fewer people 
vote in the congressional elections 
held every two years, according to 
a George Mason University study — 
and it shows.
When our country was founded, 
every citizen had the right to sign 
any private contract and have it up-
held by a court. Everyone had the 
right to keep all income they fairly 
earned. Everyone had the right to 
enjoy recreational drugs. Every 
marriage made at the state level was 
recognized at the federal level, and 
every business could hire a worker 
without incurring the egregious 
compliance costs associated with 
federal regulation.
None of that is now true about 
America. While we have come a long 
way in some areas, namely in racial 
and gender equality, we have sat idly 
by while other basic freedoms were 
stripped from us by well-intentioned 
men who thought that they knew 
us better than we knew ourselves. 
Through the process of voter apathy, 
our government has stopped repre-
senting us.
Corruption has seeped through 
the cracks made by our neglect and 
interests of outside parties now hold 
more sway in our government than 
the people do. 
We have no one to blame for this 
except ourselves, but rather than 
letting this deter us, we should real-
ize that the need to vote has never 
been more urgent that it is now, and 
a lack of education or caring is no 
excuse for watching your freedoms 
erode.
As founding father Thomas Jef-
ferson said, “I know of no safe re-
pository of the ultimate power of 
society but the people. And if we 
think them not enlightened enough, 
the remedy is not to take power 
from them, but to inform them by 
education.” Information has never 
been more readily available than it 
is now. American citizens owe it to 
those that created the great experi-
ment that is the U.S., those who died 
for the country, and to themselves to 
do everything in their power to pro-
tect the ideals that have made this 
nation so prosperous.
I believe in American exception-
alism. We are the greatest country 
in the world. We are colonist John 
Winthrop’s “city upon a hill.” We 
are a country founded upon the idea 
that no man, mob, or government 
can restrict your volition. Your free 
will and your ability to exercise it are 
the only sacred things on this Earth 
and supersede any power that a gov-
ernment may ever attempt to exert 
upon you. Should any force attempt 
to take from you that which — by 
your own perseverance, daring, and 
skill — you have wrought into exis-
tence, or should anything prevent 
you from realizing every last ?eeting 
zephyr of thought that may compel 
your actions, the ?rm hand of justice 
would strike down the forces that 
oppose you and leave you free to 
pursue happiness.
Those before us have been beat-
en, jailed, tortured, and killed to 
protect that idea, and it is because 
of them that the great American ex-
periment continues to be the beacon 
of the free world. 
Eternal vigilance truly is the price 
of liberty, and it is our turn to sit be-
side that Roman warrior outside of 
the National Archives and pick up 
the mantle of the always watchful 
soldier, guarding the sanctity and 
validity of our republic.

A PERSON’S OPINION
Election Day is this Tuesday, and the citizens of the U.S. elect their next President. So we asked,
Why do you think voting is important?
Compiled by Jonathan Carreon and Jennifer Coloma
November 5, 2012 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
CARL GLAZER
This Election Day, millions of 
people across the nation will go to 
the polls and cast their ballots for the 
President of the U.S. Unfortunately 
for many of these voters, their votes 
will not actually have an impact on 
the election. Due to our current Elec-
toral College system, the political fate 
of the country rests in the hands of 
the voters in a few undecided states. 
This massive disconnect between the 
popular vote and the election of our 
nation’s leader needs to be corrected 
if we are to continue to claim that 
each vote matters.
The Electoral College was initially 
established in the Constitution as a 
compromise between the populace 
directly electing the president and 
Congress independently voting for 
the President and Vice President. 
Today, each state selects electors 
equal to its representation in Con-
gress (one for each Representative 
and Senator). Those electors vote 
for the President and Vice President 
based on a winner-take-all vote by 
the state’s population.
The solution that immediately 
comes to mind is to abolish the elec-
torate system, similar to what the 
17th Amendment did for electing 
Senators. However, this fundamen-
tally rede?nes our governmental sys-
tem and poses many problems. The 
?rst issue of this proposal would be 
recounts. When the popular vote is 
won by 0.5 percent or less, each state 
recounts ballots by hand. While this 
is already time consuming in large 
states — like Florida during the 2000 
election — the possibility of hand-
recounting the over 120 million votes 
cast for a presidential election is an 
unfathomable task that would re-
quire much time and manpower.
Having only a popular vote would 
also mean a candidate could receive 
signi?cantly less than a majority of 
the vote due to third parties draw-
ing away votes. A two-round system 
— where a second round of voting 
would occur for the two most popu-
lar candidates of a larger pool of 
initial candidates — would partially 
prevent this issue. However, it would 
still allow a candidate whom less 
than 50 percent of America initially 
wanted as their top choice to win.
A more reasonable solution would 
be to change the current format of 
the Electoral College to a represen-
tative sample of the states’ political 
preferences. Maine and Nebraska 
both currently split their electors on 
a proportional basis and serve as im-
plementation examples. They both 
treat each Congressional Represen-
tative district as having one elector, 
with that elector voting for whoever 
gains a majority in that district. Their 
two remaining senator-based elec-
tors are then given to whoever wins 
the full state popular vote.
This proposal would dramatically 
change the way campaigns are cur-
rently run. For example, voters in 
more Democratic-leaning districts in 
highly Republican states would not 
have their votes drowned out by the 
rest of the state. This change would 
move the focus of campaigns from 
toss-up states to toss-up districts, and 
would prevent candidates from com-
pletely ignoring the vast majority of 
states in the run up to the election. 
This setup would also open the door 
for third parties to begin gaining 
footholds by earning one or two elec-
tors in districts across the country.
The current election system disen-
franchises many voters in solid left-
leaning or right-swaying states. The 
move to a proportional Electoral Col-
lege would bring us one step closer to 
the ultimate ideal of “one citizen, one 
vote” without many of the logistical 
nightmares that would accompany it.

Obama’s promises convey character
SATVIKA NETI
Junior Staffwriter
Fundamentally, this election 
is about two candidates with op-
posing views of how this country 
should be run. But it is as much 
about opposing characters as it is 
about opposing policies.
President Barack Obama has 
become the ?rst sitting President 
to endorse marriage equality. His 
backing has put the issue on the 
Democratic party’s platform, and 
that’s important. This isn’t because 
it’s about gay rights, but because 
it’s about equal rights.
People say that it doesn’t really 
matter what promises politicians 
make to us during the campaign 
season because that’s all they are: 
vague promises. But ful?lling one’s 
promises isn’t what’s important 
during a campaign. The question 
is not of policies, but of character.
Obama’s promise for gay rights 
tells me that he believes in equal-
ity and that he’s willing to stand 
up for what he believes in, even 
though it’s not the convenient op-
tion. It’s important because it says 
that Obama is willing to see all 
people as humans who deserve the 
same rights. It makes me feel as if 
he would ?ght for me, not because 
he wants my vote, but because he 
believes it is the right thing to do.
Republican presidential can-
didate Mitt Romney, on the other 
hand, would single out a group 
of people and make them seem 
lesser and not as worthy as the 
rest of society through measures 
like his Federal Marriage Amend-
ment. I ?nd something fundamen-
tally wrong with doing that to any 
group of people for any reason.
The economy — the primary 
reason many people cite as to why 
they’re voting for Romney — is ac-
tually why I’m screaming, “Four 
more years.” According to The 
Guardian, as of Friday, there have 
been 25 consecutive months of job 
growth under Obama’s term and 
the unemployment rate has stayed 
under 8 percent for the past couple 
of months. Obama has a de?nite 
plan to reduce the de?cit by reduc-
ing tax breaks for the rich, invest-
ing in the middle class by funding 
education and agriculture, and 
ending foreign wars.
The important thing about this 
is that he has a plan. Romney has 
failed, even while being prodded 
by various people, to tell us his 
plan. He says he’ll close loopholes 
and create jobs — while neglect-
ing to specify how or which ones 
— and somehow ?nd $5 billion for 
tax cuts and unnecessary defense 
spending at the same time.
I want someone who knows 
what they want for the country 
and has a proven track record of 
going after what they want, rather 
than someone who refuses to tell 
us or simply doesn’t know. Obama 
believes in this country. He’s prov-
en for four years that he has what 
it takes to run it. Let’s give him an-
other four.
Electoral College and popular vote both have issues

PA jumped the gun on Hurricane Sandy prep
KAVITA MEHTA
Junior Staffwriter
Hurricane Sandy spread high 
winds, heavy rains, and electrical 
outages from the Carolinas all the 
way up to Maine last week. However, 
some states felt the impact of this 
Category 1 hurricane more than oth-
ers. 
Considering all of the damage 
that happened in the tri-state area — 
New York, New Jersey, and Connecti-
cut — Pittsburgh, and Pennsylvania 
as a whole, overreacted to the storm.
Pennsylvania’s efforts to prepare 
for Sandy seemed extreme when 
compared to the storm’s actual ef-
fects here. All Pittsburgh public 
schools cancelled last Tuesday’s 
classes in an announcement Monday 
night; since there was only mild rain 
and wind on Tuesday, this decision 
was made too quickly and too early 
by city of?cials. They could have at 
least waited to make that decision 
on Tuesday morning, the day of the 
hurricane, when they saw the actual 
storm and its minimal effects.
Pittsburgh only received two-and-
a-half inches of rain because of the 
hurricane, which — while above the 
average rainfall for October in the 
state — was still minor when com-
pared to New York’s and New Jer-
sey’s ?ooding. The highest tide of 13 
feet that rose in the New York Harbor 
poured into the city, all seven tunnels 
under the East River were ?ooded, 
high tides put much of New Jersey’s 
Seaside Heights’ boardwalk and 85 
percent of Atlantic City underwater, 
and Ground Zero was ?ooded with 
20 feet of water.
Instead of creating 58 station-
ary evacuation centers throughout 
the state, which — according to the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette — were not 
guaranteed to be used, Pennsylvania 
could have better allotted its time 
and resources by making more mo-
bile Red Cross emergency vehicles,  
increasing its current 100.
As weather detection is an im-
precise science, meteorologists in 
Pennsylvania were unsure of where 
to build evacuation centers. None of 
those centers could have been used if 
they were constructed in the wrong 
locations. In fact, very few evacua-
tion centers were even used in Penn-
sylvania because of inconvenient 
locations and the minimal impact 
of the storm. However, more mobile 
emergency vehicles would have been 
useful because they can help any vic-
tim in any location.
The destruction created by 
Hurricane Sandy in Pennsylvania 
shouldn’t be overlooked or underes-
timated. But the scope of the state’s 
reaction to the storm, as well as the 
inef?cient implementation of evacu-
ation centers, should be evaluated 
for how Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh 
responds to future natural disasters.

I found myself in a state of pure 
shock last Tuesday. During my daily 
afternoon check of all of my favorite 
social media and nerdy news web-
sites, I discovered a story I would 
have thought was a joke had it not 
appeared so consistently: Disney 
bought Lucas?lm. Even more shock-
ingly, Star Wars Episode VII has a ten-
tative release date of summer 2015. 
As a lifelong Star Wars geek — one 
who is still coming to terms with the 
fact that Disney just bought Marvel 
— I sensed a great disturbance in the 
force. It was as if millions of fanboys 
cried out in terror and were suddenly 
silenced... by a mouse.
After reading more, I eventually 
came to terms with the $4 billion 
buyout. Former owner of Lucas?lm, 
George Lucas, has apparently decid-
ed that his circle is now complete and 
is allowing the students to become 
the masters. In other words, he’s re-
tiring — but not without the second 
highest share in Disney’s stock after 
the estate of Steve Jobs, as well as 
the job of creative consultant on the 
proposed new ?lms. But what exactly 
does this mean for adoring fans?
On one hand, there are going to be 
new Star Wars movies. On the other, 
we all remember how lackluster the 
prequels were, to say the least. It’s a 
scary thought that the next trilogy 
could feel closer to Attack of Clones 
than Empire Strikes Back. Even if you 
didn’t ?nd the prequels to be utterly 
awful, you have to admit they didn’t 
carry the charm of original triology. 
Furthermore, for those of us who are 
really into the galaxy far, far away, 
this move seems to render pointless 
all of the many Expanded Universe 
novels, video games, and comics that 
continued the story of Luke, Leia, 
and Han well beyond the end credits 
of Return of the Jedi.
For instance, Star Wars fandom 
has considered the Grand Admiral 
Thrawn trilogy of novels (in which 
what remains of the Empire tries to 
hold on to the galaxy as Luke meets 
his wife, and Han and Leia have kids) 
the defacto Episodes VII, VIII, and 
IX. Yet now there’s no reason to be-
lieve those stories will be acknowl-
edged, and in fact some reports, such 
as those from NBC, have explicitly 
stated that they de?nitely will not be 
adapted.
Sure, it’ll be exciting to see some 
new stories, but without a strong 
foundation there’s always the poten-
tial for another mistake like Jar-Jar 
Binks. Such a turn of events could 
lead to anger, which leads to hate, 
which in turn leads to the Dark Side.
However, I am actually pleasantly 
surprised at how everything’s turned 
out for Marvel after Disney acquired 
it. It’s hard to say how much Disney 
actually had a hand in that success, 
but the company hasn’t screwed any-
thing up yet. So while a few days ago 
I may have felt as though Disney was 
attempting to slowly buy everything 
I loved, I now realize that even if that 
were the case, it could be a lot worse. 
It could be Michael Bay or M. Night 
Shyamalan making 
their marks, as 
Transformers and 
Avatar: The 
Last Airbender 
fans are all too 
aware of.
In case any-
one still feels as 
though no good could 
possibly come of this pur-
chase, Lucas has decided 
to set up an education trust 
with a signi?cant portion of the 
money he’s earned in this deal. So 
if nothing else, at least some practi-
cal good will come out of this.
I, for one, would much rather 
see children getting the education 
they deserve than have my sel?sh 
wish for speci?c stories be met. And 
I’ll be the ?rst to admit that come 
2015, I’ll likely be waiting in line, in 
costume, at the midnight release of 
Episode VII. Given my namesake, it’s 
not like I have much of a choice.

Swimming and diving hosts Clarion
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
The men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving teams 
dove into their ?rst home 
meet of the season last week-
end. The Tartans hosted the 
Division-II Clarion Univer-
sity Golden Eagles. The men’s 
team crushed Clarion Univer-
sity 202–97, while the wom-
en’s team fell 198–102.
The men took ?rst in many 
events and swept some events 
entirely. The ?rst-years got 
their ?rst taste of competition 
at home, with many of them 
responsible for ?rst-place ?n-
ishes. First-year Christopher 
Wysocki took ?rst place in 
the 1,000-yard freestyle with 
a time of 9:56.82. In the 200-
yard freestyle, ?rst-year Ste-
ven Geier took ?rst place with 
a time of 1:46.62.
The 200-yard medley re-
lay team of sophomore Josh 
Lucheon, sophomore Cole 
Um, junior Terrence Wong, 
and ?rst-year Lucas Bruder 
?nished in 1:37.22. The 200-
yard freestyle relay team of 
Bruder, Wong, ?rst-year Cart-
er Sharer, and junior Edward 
Sears also took ?rst, ?nishing 
in 1:27.34.
The Tartan women, despite 
losing, still had ?rst-place ?n-
ishes from junior Soleil Phan, 
who won the 100-yard but-
ter?y in 58.99, and junior 
Megan Garvey, who won the 
500-yard freestyle in 5:21.06. 
Phan also ?nished second in 
the 200-yard freestyle with 
a time of 1:55.60 and in the 
200-yard individual medley 
in 2:12.62. Meanwhile, Gar-
vey also placed second in the 
200-yard butter?y with a time 
of 2:11.92.
The women’s team saw 
strong ?nishes from its ?rst-
years. First-year Felicia Wang 
had two second-place ?nishes 
for the Tartans in breaststroke 
events. The ?rst was in the 
100-yard breaststroke with 
a time of 1:08.47, and the 
second was in the 200-yard 
breaststroke with a time of 
2:32.53. First-year Kira Sing-
haus recorded another Tartan 
second-place ?nish in the 100-
yard backstroke with a time of 
1:00.14.
In the diving pool, ?rst-
year Winona Li had the best 
?nish for the Tartans with her 
?fth-place ?nish off the one-
meter board.
“I think we’re doing great 
for this point in the season. 
This is the point where train-
ing gets really intense, but ev-
eryone was pushing through 
during the meet and I feel like 
our team is really coming to-
gether,” sophomore Nicole 
Crimi said.
The men’s and women’s 
teams will host Grove City 
College on Saturday.

Cross country takes 
third place at UAAs
Women’s soccer ties Emory 0–0 
ABBY SMITH
Assistant Sports Editor
The women’s soccer team 
tied with the Emory Univer-
sity Eagles 0–0, ?nishing the 
season in second place in 
the University Athletic Asso-
ciation Championships play. 
The Tartans’ overall record is 
11–1–4, making them No. 19 
in the nation, while the No. 8 
Eagles ?nished their season 
11–1–6.
Sophomore mid?elder 
Jordyn Greenburg and junior 
defender Rachel Contopou-
los made many goal attempts 
during the ?rst period of Sat-
urday’s game, but Emory’s 
goalkeeper, senior Kaele 
Leonard, did not give the Tar-
tans a chance to score.
Emory’s defensive strength 
was equally matched by a 
strong Carnegie Mellon de-
fense. Junior goalkeeper 
Anna Albi was a critical player 
for the Tartans, making a total 
of nine saves, including six in 
the second period.
Her ?nal save of the game 
in the 105th minute marked 
her sixth shutout of the sea-
son.
In the second period, ju-
nior forward Alex Veneagas, 
senior mid?elder Katie Davis, 
and ?rst-year Carson Quiros 
also made several goal at-
tempts.
“I am so proud of our team 
for playing so well against 
a great Emory team. We 
showed heart and proved we 
can play with the best team in 
the country. We are a special 
team that hopefully will get 
the chance to keep playing in 
the NCAAs,” senior mid?elder 
Stephanie Hare said.
The Tartans will now await 
the selection of the ?eld for 
the National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association (NCAA) Divi-
sion-III Women’s Soccer Tour-
nament, as the team hopes to 
receive an at-large bid to the 
Championship draw.

The men’s and women’s 
cross country teams traveled 
to Rochester, N.Y., on Oct. 27 
to compete in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Championships hosted by the 
University of Rochester.
Both the men’s and wom-
en’s teams brought home 
third-place trophies.
Third place was quite 
the accomplishment for the 
women’s cross country team. 
The Tartans had not broken 
into the top three since 1998 
when they took home the 
championship.
Three of the women ?n-
ished within the top 14 of 
the 6k race. The top ?ve race 
times were factored into the 
Tartans’ overall score of 103 
points.
The ?rst ?nisher was se-
nior Emily Wobb, placing 
seventh overall with a time of 
22:37.3.
Finishing just 4.8 seconds 
behind her in 10th place was 
junior Elise Hall. Sophomore 
Halley Bayer rounded out 
the top, ?nishing with 11th 
place.
First-year Rekha Schnepf’s 
time of 23:28.3 was factored 
into the Tartans’ score as 
well, as she took 35th place 
overall.
The last score for the Tar-
tans came from senior Eva 
Humphrey in 44th place 
with a time of 23:37.3. This 
brought the Tartans’ grand 
total to 1:55:07.5.
“Getting third was unbe-
lievable,” Hall said. “I de?-
nitely had high hopes, but 
I wasn’t really sure what to 
expect. Everything we had 
been working toward came 
together. As far as the rest of 
the season, we of course have 
our sights set on doing just as 
well at regionals to get us to 
nationals.”
The men’s cross country 
team competed in the 8k, 
also ?nishing third overall. 
The men also had three top-
14 ?nishers, scoring a total of 
65 points.
It was again up to the top 
?ve ?nishers to decide the 
team’s ?nal score.
The ?rst Tartan ?nisher 
was senior Evan Gates with a 
time of 25:16.4, earning him 
fourth place overall and the 
highest Tartan ?nish of UAAs. 
Just after Gates, junior Josh 
Newby took ?fth place over-
all with a time of 25:20.2.
Junior Ken Murphy was 
the third ?nisher for the Tar-
tans with a time of 25:43.0, 
putting him in 11th place 
overall.
The fourth and ?fth ?n-
ishers for Carnegie Mellon 
?nished within 3.8 seconds 
of each other: Sophomore 
George Degen ?nished 20th 
with a time of 25:51.3 and se-
nior Billy Little?eld ?nished 
23rd overall with a time of 
25:55.1. Together, the Tar-
tans had a grand total time of 
2:08:06.1.
The now No. 20-nation-
ally ranked Tartans will 
travel this Saturday to NCAA 
Regional Championships in 
Carlisle, Pa., hosted by Dick-
inson College.

The Tartan men’s soccer 
team fell just short of taking 
the number one spot in the 
University Athletic Associa-
tion (UAA) in its game against 
the Emory University Eagles 
on Saturday night.
The ?nal score was 1–0, 
leaving Carnegie Mellon in 
a four-way tie with Brandeis 
University, Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis, and Emo-
ry University for ?rst place in 
conference play.
The game was hard fought 
and very physical. There was 
a total of 29 fouls called, 15 
of which were from Carnegie 
Mellon.
The ?rst half concluded 
with a score of 0–0 due to the 
tough defense of both teams.
While there were no 
goals in the ?rst half of the 
game, the Eagles attempted 
six shots, and the Tartans at-
tempted three.
Twenty–seven minutes 
into the second half, the Ea-
gles attempted their seventh 
shot of the half and connected 
with the net.
With the remaining 18 
minutes, the Tartans took 
two unsuccessful shots. Ju-
nior mid?elder Chris Wysocki 
took the ?rst shot, which was 
just wide of the goal; senior 
mid?elder John Crawshaw 
took the second shot, which 
was saved by Emory’s keeper.
Carnegie Mellon’s goal-
keeper, junior Christopher 
Madden, made four saves 
throughout the game.
“We were off our game 
and couldn’t ?nd a rhythm. [It 
was] one of the few games in 
which that’s happened to us. 
Unfortunately for us, Emory 
was on their game and took 
advantage of our average per-
formance,” senior defender 
Alex Abedian said.
The Tartans concluded 
their regular season play with 
a record of 12–3–1 and a UAA 
record of 4–2–1. Carnegie 
Mellon will be entering post-
season play and will receive 
its bid as of 1:30 p.m. on 
Monday.

Tartans conquer University of Chicago at home
ADAM GRUBER
Sports Co-Editor
After a poor offensive 
showing against the Wash-
ington University in St. Louis 
Bears two weekends ago, the 
Tartans rediscovered the of-
fense that had them at 4–0 by 
the end of September.
The Tartans played the Uni-
versity of Chicago Maroons on 
Saturday in their last home 
game of the season, defeating 
them 31–14 due to a tremen-
dous rushing performance.  
This victory brings the Tar-
tans to 6–3 in the season and 
1–1 in conference play.
The Maroons’ season fell to 
4–5 in the season and 0–2 in 
conference play.
Senior running back Pat-
rick Blanks lead the Tartans in 
their victory over the Maroons 
with his 159 rushing yards and 
three touchdowns, the Tartans 
put together 235 yards of posi-
tive offense on the ground.
Blanks is averaging 82.6 
rushing yards per game and 
has scored 10 touchdowns 
this season, both of which are 
highs on the team.
This was the ?fth time 
in Blanks’ career and the 
third time this season that he 
rushed for three touchdowns 
in a single game.
“It was clearer [Saturday] 
than ever before how much 
Patrick means to our offense 
and the team,” junior quarter-
back Rob Kalkstein said. “We 
are a different team when he 
is on the ?eld.”
The Carnegie Mellon front-
line defense held the Maroons’ 
rushing attack to just 71 to-
tal yards, accumulating eight 
tackles for losses and two 
sacks.
Junior inside linebacker 
Akwasi Brefo led the squad 
with 10 tackles.
Junior defensive lineman 
Ryan Jok’s aggressive play on 
the line resulted in two tackles 
for a loss.
Junior wide receiver Tim 
Kikta inched closer to the 
Carnegie Mellon receiving 
yards record, putting in 31 
yards on Saturday.
With 32 receiving yards 
left for the upcoming game 
against Case Western Reserve 
University, he has the poten-
tial to break the record very 
soon.
First-year kicker Connor 
Young kicked a career-long 
45-yard ?eld goal in the third 
to put the Tartans up 17–14. 
Carnegie Mellon never relin-
quished the lead after that 
score.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
will close this year’s campaign 
on the road against the Case 
Western Reserve Spartans. 
Kickoff is at 2 p.m.
Last season, the Tartans 
lost to the Spartans in a shoot-
out, losing by a score of 38–24. 
If the Carnegie Mellon of-
fense can put up offensive 
numbers reminiscent of those 
in their performance against 
the Maroons this past Sat-
urday, the Spartans should 
prove to be no problem for the 
Tartans.

Assistant Sports Editor
Junior wide receiver Tim Kikta is a big 
man on campus. At 6'3" and nearly 200 
pounds, the towering Tartan football super-
star has been one of the top contributors this 
season and is a critical member of Carnegie 
Mellon’s team.
The Pittsburgh native is also one of the 
team’s top scorers, with ?ve touchdowns this 
season.
Kikta was named the University Athletic 
Association and Eastern College Athletic 
Conference Southwest Athlete of the Week 
during the second week of September, 
prompted by his performance during the 
Tartans’ 37–7 victory.
He set a Carnegie Mellon single-game re-
cord with 158 receiving yards in the game. 
Kikta caught four passes that game, includ-
ing touchdown receptions of 82 and 39 yards 
from junior quarterback Rob Kalkstein. The 
82-yard score was the longest touchdown re-
ception by a Tartan since 2004.
“Tim has been a great offensive player 
this year. I can’t even tell you how many 
times I’ve thrown a pass and he’s been right 
there to make an amazing catch,” Kalkstein 
said. “He also has made a number of touch-
downs over 50 yards, which is outstanding.”
Kikta does not brag about his personal 
achievements; rather, he focuses on the his-
toric season for the team. The Tartans went 
4–0 at the beginning of the season for the 
?rst time since 2006.
“This year has been an awesome one for 
us,” he said. “From the start, I felt like it was 
going to be a great season.” He attributed 
the success of the team to the return of “a 
lot of starters” and recognized “the giant im-
provement between this year and previous 
ones.”
Although the Tartans had a phenomenal 
start, the team has faltered, dropping to a 
5–3 record. But still, team-focused Kikta 
is optimistic about the remainder of the 
season.
“We lost a lot of key running backs and 
middle backers due to injuries,” he said. 
“But we are trying to get them back in shape 
as soon as we can.”
Kikta is certainly no stranger to the world 
of football, having played since second 
grade.
 “I love the camaraderie of the sport,” he 
said. “Getting to know [my teammates] is 
certainly my favorite part of playing. It truly 
is the ultimate team sport.”
His teammates also admire him for his 
optimism and dedication. “Big Time Timmy 
Tim,” Kalkstein said, “always brings a posi-
tive attitude. In the huddle he knows exactly 
what to say. He is always into the game, and 
helps us stay focused.”
Kikta said that during his nearly 15 years 
of playing football, he has “grown so much 
as a player,” and has especially come a long 
way during his college career. “One game 
during freshman year, I lined up on the 
wrong side of the ball three times,” he said. 
“I tried to convince coach that the quarter-
back [Kalkstein] called the play wrong when 
really I was totally and completely at fault.”
Kikta and Kalkstein have become close 
friends since their ?rst year at Carnegie Mel-
lon. Both had internships in Pittsburgh over 
the summer and are currently roommates. 
“We would always practice passing over the 
summer, which I really think helped our 
chemistry this year,” Kalkstein said.
Kikta is currently a mechanical engineer-
ing major and hopes to work with cars and 
airplanes. “I would love to design vehicles,” 
he said. “Right now, I’m looking for intern-
ships where I would get to explore my pas-
sion for vehicles and engineering even 
more.”
For Kikta, football serves as a stress re-
liever from Carnegie Mellon’s heavy work-
load. From Friday night dinners with the 
never-ending pasta bowl at Olive Garden to 
“having our offensive coordinator drive us 
around the ?eld in his golf cart,” Kikta said 
he’s “become best friends with these guys.”
Kikta and the team will take the ?eld for 
the last time this season for the away game 
against Case Western Reserve University on 
Saturday.

Carnegie Mellon’s vol-
leyball team competed in the 
University Athletic Associa-
tion (UAA) tournament last 
week, playing Case Western 
Reserve University on Friday 
and the University of Roches-
ter on Saturday.
In the ?rst game against 
Case Western Reserve, the 
Tartans won 25–19, but then 
lost the next two games 25–15 
and 25–13, respectively.
With a 25–20 win in the 
fourth game, the Tartans 
forced a tie-breaking ?fth 
game. But the Tartans came 
up short, losing that game 
15–11.
Sophomore right side hit-
ter Ali Celentano gave a strong 
performance, recording 30 
kills in this match. First-year 
setter Emily Lawlis racked up 
26 assists and junior setter 
Emily Wright added 15. Ju-
nior defensive specialist Ali 
Nichols led the defense with 
21 digs, and junior outside 
hitter Rachel Miller had 17.
The loss put the Tartans 
in the ?fth-place consolation 
match on Saturday against 
the University of Rochester 
Yellowjackets.
Every game in Saturday’s 
match was tightly contested. 
The Tartans won the ?rst 
match 25–22 before drop-
ping the second one 28–26. 
Then they won the third game 
29–27, lost the fourth 25–13, 
and closed out the match with 
the victory in game ?ve with 
15–9.
Celentano topped her per-
formance on Friday, accumu-
lating 36 kills in this match 
to lead the Tartans to their 
3–2 victory. She also added 
19 digs. Junior outside hitter 
Senna Parsa added 16 kills, 
and Miller had 12.
Nichols had 23 digs on the 
defensive end, Miller added 
12, and Lawlis had 11. At the 
net, junior middle blocker Ol-
ivia Mora had six blocks.
“I’m proud of the team for 
playing their hardest, even up 
to the last match of the sea-
son,” senior defensive special-
ist Kasey LaMothe said.

Sex, culture, pop: Deborah Kass
New Warhol Museum exhibit examines feminism, Judaism
What do you get when you cross Andy Warhol and a 
pop-culture-obsessed Jewish feminist? Deborah Kass.
The Andy Warhol Museum is currently hosting a 
massive mid-career retrospective of the artist and 
Carnegie Mellon alumna (CFA ’74) called Deborah Kass: 
Before and Happily Ever After. The exhibit features 
three decades’ worth of work by Kass — an impressive 
80 works ranging from early abstract landscapes to 
appropriations of Warhol’s famous works.
Kass is a New York-based artist whose work explores 
the intersection of pop culture, art history, and 
self-identity. Most of her work is centered on her 
own identity as a Jewish lesbian, but the exhibit also 
includes a good deal of her older landscape paintings.
In Kass’ early work, the technique is as important 
as the concept. In fact, the conceptual basis for her 
early paintings, mostly from the ’80s, is often hard 
to determine without the informational labels that 
the museum provides. Luckily for museum-goers, 
the paintings are visually strong on their own, with 
bright colors and bold brushstrokes that grab viewers’ 
attention.
Kass’ work took an interesting turn in the early ’90s, 
when she began appropriating Warhol’s work with a 
little twist of her own. Instead of featuring prominent 
celebrities in her works, Kass focused the work on her 
own heroes, including writer Gertrude Stein, baseball 
player Sandy Koufax, and singer and actress Barbra

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I’m a TA, and I really love 
the job. The problem is 
I have a crush on one of 
my students, and I think 
he likes me too! He has 
an A in the class, but he 
comes to my office hours 
all the time asking for 
extra credit. I think I could 
lose my job if I pursued 
anything. What should I 
do?
Thanks,

Tips
Dear HOT FOR STUDENT,
We’ll go ahead and assume 
this guy is into you (why 
else would anyone go to 
office hours?). If you’re 
unethical, then it’s pretty 
simple: Next time he comes 
to office hours, offer him 
some special “extra credit.” 
Maybe hold some special 
office hours in your dorm, if 
you catch my drift. Based 
on his performance, you 
can decide whether or not 
to give him any actual extra 
credit.
If you want to stay ethical, 
think about this: If you grade, 
then you really shouldn’t 
date your students. If you 
don’t, then it’s probably 
okay. Consider running 
it past your professor or 
checking the official school 
guidelines. I tried to do 
some research about your 
question, except all I found 
were really inappropriate 
videos.
You probably don’t want 
to do what they did,

Dear Patrick,
I go out to PHI on average 
four times a week. It’s 
gotten to the point where 
I know the bartender 
and all the middle-aged 
regulars by name. Is this 
too much? Should I try 
other bars? Or, perish the 
thought, go out to bars 
less often? It’s certainly 
taking a toll on my wallet, 
but I need my Wednesday 
night beer. My liver begs 
for an answer.
I wrote this from a bar,
Buying Alcohol Regularly, 
Purchases Highly 
Intoxicating
Dear BAR PHI,
If going to PHI is wrong, I 
don’t want to be right. It’s 
cheap, it’s close, and it’s got 
booze. That’s all I look for in 
a bar, but other people are 
pickier. I probably should tell 
you to go out and explore 
the world of Pittsburgh bars 
but that’d be hypocritical 
of me. And I am not a 
hypocrite.
Having said that, you should 
go out and explore the 
world of Pittsburgh bars. 
PHI is a great weeknight 
bar, but it’s pretty shabby 
by comparison. Take a 
weekend off, check out what 
else is out there, and then 
come back to the sweet 
embrace of PHI. If money’s 
a problem, then stick with 
the drink specials for a good 
deal on booze. There’s no 
reason not to go to PHI on a 
Wednesday.
Other than wanting 
to preserve your self-
respect,
Patrick Hoskins

Streisand, to name a few. Streisand appears as 
the subject of Kass’ well-known “The Jewish 
Jackie” series, which portrays Streisand in the 
style of Warhol’s paintings of Jackie Kennedy.
At this point, Kass’ work started making clearer 
conceptual statements about feminism and 
“Jewishness.” By focusing on being Jewish — as 
opposed to Judaism as a religion — Kass brings 
an often-overlooked group into the foreground 
without religious undertones. Her work shows 
the cultural stigmas attached to the group.
The highlight of the exhibit is the work from 
Kass’ series “The Warhol Project,” which she 
worked on throughout the ’90s. In this series, 
Kass put her own spin on Warhol’s works, 
copying his technique of combining painting 
and silk-screening, but replacing his cool, 
detached subjects with people who had personal 
significance to her. These works are scattered 
throughout the museum, often with Warhol’s 
original works placed directly next to Kass’ 
appropriations. It is often difficult to tell which 
work is whose, since they are visually very 
similar, but a closer look reveals the pairing to be 
an interesting juxtaposition of subjects.
One of the largest pieces in the exhibit — 
and an outstanding example of Kass’ Warhol 
appropriations — is “America’s Most Wanted.” 
Playing off Warhol’s “Thirteen Most Wanted 
Men,” which featured silkscreens of criminals, 
Kass’ work replaces criminals with well-known 
curators.
The exhibit closes with some of Kass’ most 
recent work, from the late 2000s. This work 
expands on her study of art history and popular 
culture, taking examples of post-war painting 
and pairing them with lyrics from songs in 
The Great American Songbook. The project 
combines emotionally stimulating song lyrics 
with modernist pop painting styles.
Throughout the exhibit, Kass’ thoughtful work is 
perfectly interspersed with Warhol’s, creating an 
impressive and memorable retrospective of the 
artist’s career.

A recently rediscovered color, closest to maroon or 
burgundy, hit the runways this season and has since 
been embraced by celebrities and fashion designers 
alike. This darker, cooler, more muted shade of red made 
an appearance in this year’s collections of Yves Saint 
Laurent, Marc Jacobs, and Alexander Wang.
Termed “oxblood” by fashion enthusiasts due to its 
resemblance to the color of oxygenated blood, the color 
has garnered attention from well-known personalities 
such as Blake Lively and Kate Middleton. While the 
former donned a Gucci embellished minidress in 
the wine-colored hue, the latter opted for a more 
conservative blazer and skirt combination by French 
designer Paule Ka.
Despite the myriad interpretations of the color red, 
oxblood has been agreed upon as the color of the 
moment. In The Huf?ngton Post article “Why Wear 
Oxblood?” writer Lily Avnet explains that the color may 
have moved quickly into the spotlight because people 
are so weary of the severity of the color red.
In other words, oxblood is appreciated for its understated 
quality, regardless of its gory name. Fashion articles like 
“Oxblood...the New Black!” on the nail polish blog EG 
Nails It, “Oxblood Love” on the She Knows blog, and 
“Trend Report: There will be oxblood” in The Washington 
Post indicate how this hue is becoming a staple in 
everyone’s wardrobe.
Since oxblood is the color of the season, it’s easy to ?nd 
anything in stores in this shade of red. Take any of these 
suggestions, or create your own look.
Preppy
Feeling girly? Rock a burgundy dress or skirt, such as 
the Oxblood Ribbed Pleated Skirt from Topshop. Pair the 
skirt with a ?tted black tee, patterned tights, and boots. 
For a preppier look, match a pair of BlankNYC designer 
jeans in rhubarb with a shirt in a neutral color. Complete 
the out?t with a skinny brown belt and a pair of brown 
Oxfords. If your style is more sophisticated, try a 
burgundy blazer, such as the Oxblood Ponte Blazer from 
Topshop, with jeans, a beige top, and black ballet ?ats.
Edgy
Get an edgier look by ?aunting a pair of wine-colored Dr. 
Martens “Pascal” boots with your out?t. If you’re willing 
to splurge, make a statement with the Rich & Skinny 
“Legacy Leather” Faux Leather Skinny Jeans. Wear them 
with a baggy sweater in tan or gray to look fashionable, 
but not over the top.
Combining Trends
If you’re a girl who likes to stand out in a crowd, combine 
autumn and winter trends and pick up a pair of oxblood 
velvet leggings from American Apparel. Wear them with 
a black or gray tunic for an awesome out?t. The peplum 
hem is another major look this year, so a burgundy 
peplum top is a great way to incorporate two trends into 
an out?t without making it too overwhelming. Patterned 
jeans are also everywhere at the moment; what better 
way to mix trends than with a pair of oxblood patterned 
jeans? Try the Current/Elliott “The Ankle” Print Crop 
Skinny Jeans in the color “Crimson Tapestry.” Guys and 
girls can both rock this trendy look.
Nail Polishes
If you’re weary of buying clothing in oxblood, try nail 
polish colors such as Essie’s “Berry Hard” or “Lacy Not 
Racy” and OPI’s “Bastille My Heart.”
Colors
Since burgundy is considered a statement color, it works 
best when worn with neutral colors, such as black, 
beige, and gray. However, you can spice up your out?t 
with a touch of gold, or be daring with burgundy jeans 
and a navy blazer. Pastels also work well with oxblood, 
allowing you to keep wearing your mint green or pale 
blue summer tops through the colder months. Olive with 
burgundy gives off a wintry vibe, so a pair of burgundy 
jeans and an olive sweater accessorized with an off-
white circle scarf makes for a perfect cold-weather out?t.
Oxblood is such a major trend mainly because it is 
universally ?attering. It complements all skin tones and 
works for any style, so go grab something (or a couple of 
things) in oxblood, and start styling.

On Pitchfork
“Pitchfork is incredibly pretentious.” “After I saw the review 
that Pitchfork gave my favorite album, I’ll never read 
them again.” “Pitchfork doesn’t know what they’re talking 
about.”
It’s not uncommon to hear rhetoric like this when you 
talk to hardcore music enthusiasts. While I have issues 
with the way music journalism site Pitchfork operates, it’s 
disconcerting that there are people who unequivocally 
discredit everything Pitchfork does.
Pitchfork, established in Chicago in 1996, is one of the 
most widely known music journalism sources in the nation, 
coming into existence around the time when college rock 
burst into the mainstream. In the almost two decades 
since its creation, Pitchfork has become an indie taste 
maker and unrelenting hype machine. Predictably, people 
tend to either love or hate Pitchfork.
It’s not that hard to justify disliking Pitchfork. Its rating scale 
is unbalanced; its review process is seemingly skewed 
toward music that ?ts its projected image as opposed 
to the quality of the music, and their reviews tend to be 
pretentious ramblings that sometimes act as soapboxes 
instead of legitimate, in-depth critiques (see its review of 
The Airbone Toxic Event’s self-titled debut). However, the 
staff at Pitchfork undeniably has an expansive knowledge 
of popular music and a ?ne-tuned understanding of the 
type of music that its audience seeks out.
I don’t hold a lot of faith in Pitchfork’s reviews anymore, but 
the sheer amount of cultural knowledge that it brings to 
its reviews — information on contemporaries, in?uences, 
?lm culture, current events, and analyses of local music 
scenes— is impressive, to say the least. It’s completely 
legitimate to criticize Pitchfork, but to discredit it entirely is 
a gross oversight.

It’s a Red-lettered album for Swift
Red pairs well-worn sentiments with a new sound
Taylor Swift became famous for her bright country-
crossover sound and instantly captured the coveted 
teen girl demographic upon the release of her 
eponymous ?rst album. While her new album Red is 
de?nitely a departure from her usual style, it is still 
largely a success.
The album’s title track, “Red,” is one of the clearest 
examples of Swift’s changed style. “Red” addresses 
the same classic Swift themes of young, passionate, 
unrequited love, built on the remains of her original 
country sound — the original demo recording even 
opens with the twang of a banjo — but with a new 
infusion of pop. “22” uses a strong backbeat and feel-
good lyrics to chronicle Swift’s slightly more mature 
emotional outlook as a 22-year-old. Similarly, the 
hit single that preceded Red, “We Are Never Ever 
Getting Back Together,” combined a catchy, upbeat 
tune with just the right amount of teen angst to top 
the charts for weeks.
Perhaps the most surprising song of the album for 
many long-time Swift fans is “I Knew You Were 
Trouble,” which combines a catchy refrain with a 
wailing beat. Though this song does a good job of 
exhibiting Swift’s impressive voice, it seems a little 
confused in its purpose.
While her musical style may have changed in Red, 
Swift de?nitely decided to go back to her roots when 
it came to subject matter. Red doesn’t add much to 
Swift’s somewhat tired themes; the songs ?it from 
celebrating young love to bitterly denouncing it with 
the same element of girl power that originally made 
her music so appealing. While many see Swift’s 
stylistic adaptation as a bad thing, Red continues 
the trend that started as far back as her second 
album, Fearless, and continues in her third, Speak 
Now. All of these show a move to a more pop-
focused style for Swift as she gradually strays from 
her original country sound.
Despite the pervasive new style, Red also carries a 
heavy load of standard Swift-style ballads, including 
“Treacherous” and “Come Back... Be Here.” Songs 
like these align more closely with what many Swift 
fans are probably expecting and do a good job of 
tying the album back to her roots. More charged 
songs like “Starlight” also appeal to a traditional 
Swift demographic; with its passionate crescendo of 
a chorus and sometimes unfamiliar electronic beats, 
“Starlight” is as evocative as similar power ballads 
from her previous albums, but with a new, more 
synthetic twist.
Overall, Red represents a broad sampling of Swift’s 
traditional offerings with a few surprises thrown 
in. Although her exploration of musical style might 
alienate a few traditional followers, her more 
electronic, pop-laden sound might also attract a few 
new ones, and stalwart fans will be intrigued by the 
evolution.
Swift also threw in a few collaborations, including 
“The Last Time” with the largely unknown Gary 
Lightbody and “Everything Has Changed” with 
the ever-more-popular British artist Ed Sheeran. 
Songs like these appeal to a broader fan base. Swift 
collaborates especially well with Sheeran, whose 
music falls into a similar genre as her own.
There’s no doubt that Red has a few missteps; 
sometimes Swift ventures a little bit too far out of 
her comfort zone. In the song “I Knew You Were 
Trouble,” she experiments with her sound in a way 
that just doesn’t ?t in with the rest of the album. 
However, the outlook on the album is generally 
positive.
Red will undoubtedly spark claims that Swift is a 
sellout who has abandoned her original fan base, 
as new albums from big-name artists always do. 
However, Red exempli?es Swift’s diversity as an 
artist and her willingness to experiment, rather than 
her pandering to the masses. Like Swift’s previous 
work, Red will still be the go-to album for the 
average teenager at the happy start of a relationship 
— or more often, at the bitter end of one.

As a student at Carnegie Mellon, Brendan Frederick 
wanted to blend his love for hip-hop and writing into 
a meaningful career. Frederick (H&SS ’04) is the vice 
president of music programming and development for 
BUZZMEDIA, a media company that owns and operates 
over 40 music and pop culture websites.
Frederick became involved in hip-hop journalism as 
an undergraduate. Initially obsessed with breaking 
into the music business as a talent representative, he 
decided to try his hand at writing. Although he has since 
moved on to careers at XXL, Mass Appeal, and Complex 
magazines, Frederick ?rst honed his editorial skills in the 
classroom.
“The process of reading someone’s story and dissecting 
and tearing it apart and telling them what they could 
have done differently, that was de?nitely the most useful 
thing I took away from CMU. That’s what made me feel 
like I can be an editor,” said Frederick, who majored in 
creative writing and minored in business.
Frederick attributes his editing skills to the creative 
writing faculty at Carnegie Mellon, particularly associate 
professor of English Sharon Dilworth. According to 
Dilworth, Frederick was a driven student.
“There are certain students who come along who have 
an energy and an interest in life that immediately sets 
them apart from the rest of the student body. They are 
infectious in their enthusiasm — Brendan was that kind 
of student,” Dilworth said via email. “He was so engaged 
— so smart and savvy. He didn’t need encouragement. 
He was going places well before he even knew where it 
was that he wanted to go. You don’t forget the Brendan 
Fredericks.”
While still trying to break into the music business, 
Frederick applied to internships at record labels, but was 
not accepted. “Unless you have a connection or know 
someone, it’s pretty much impossible to get your foot in 
the door,” he said.
Eventually, Frederick took another route by focusing 
on his interest in writing. He got an internship as a 
mix-tape columnist at RIME Magazine, a small hip-hop 
publication. He used that opportunity as a springboard 
to open doors that were previously closed to him. A 
turning point came during Frederick’s senior year of 
college. He was named editor-in-chief of Mass Appeal 
magazine a year after becoming an intern there. In his 
role as editor, he was ?nally able to mix his interests in 
hip-hop, journalism, and business.
“Brendan is a real good kid,” said Elliott Wilson, owner of 
hip-hop culture blog Rap Radar and editor of RESPECT. 
magazine. While Wilson was an editor at XXL magazine, 
he hired Frederick to enhance the site’s lackluster 
website. “Brendan was the reason XXL was able to beat 
a lot of our competitors,” he said.
Throughout his career, Frederick was able to build a 
reputation as a tech-savvy editor. This was especially 
useful at Complex magazine, where he worked for 
four-and-a-half years before joining BUZZMEDIA in 
September.
Complex, founded by Mark Ecko, owns advertising 
rights to popular blogs. The magazine is an extension 
of a larger brand and is an anomaly among music 
publications. As Frederick puts it, Complex is not exactly 
hip-hop, hipster, or pop: “It’s somewhere in the middle.”
“The hip-hop world thinks of Complex as a fashion 
magazine, and this sort of white mainstream media 
world thinks of us as a hip-hop magazine. It’s almost 
like we have the best of both worlds. We can get away 
with taking a lot of risks and doing things and asking 
questions that a lot of people might not be able to,” 
Frederick said.
It is a huge departure from the common newsstand 
magazines featuring an image of a celebrity against a 
white background. “A lot of magazines, their business 
is still based on selling magazines on the newsstands,” 
Frederick said. “That’s why you see so many magazines 
with a celebrity in front of a white background and cover 
lines that are designed to catch people’s eyes.”
The print issue is a canvas for experimentation. Justin 
Bieber was featured on the Complex front cover for 
the magazine’s 10th anniversary. The picture showed 
Bieber in an uncharacteristic role: getting pummeled 
in a boxing ring. The move re?ected the magazine’s 
marketing technique. “If you hate Bieber, you can see 
him get punched in the face. If you love him, you get to 
see him in this crazy, grisly scenario,” Frederick said. 
However, Complex is more concerned with its digital 
platform, a constantly updated outlet for music, fashion, 
and political news.
Frederick’s work at BUZZMEDIA is similar to what he 
did at Complex, but he focuses more on acquiring and 
maintaining media sites, including SPIN, Concrete Loop, 
The Hype Machine, and many others. On its website, 
BUZZMEDIA boasts more than 40 million people visiting 
its member sites. The company has been bolstering its 
pro?le through acquisitions: In July it acquired SPIN 
magazine, and in August it acquired three punk rock 
music blogs, including Under the Gun Review.
One of Frederick’s primary tasks is helping music 
magazine SPIN transition from a print-based business 
model to a web-based format: “BUZZ bought SPIN back 
in July, and despite being a very well-known music 
magazine with a long history, they still have a long way 
to go before they ?nd the same level of success on the 
web. Right now I’m working out of the SPIN of?ce, trying 
to help them rethink their whole operation.”
Although Frederick is removed from his college days, 
he offers the same advice that he received while at 
Carnegie Mellon: The cornerstone of a meaningful 
writing career is having con?dence. “Having con?dence 
in your writing and having con?dence in your abilities 
to critique other people’s writing are two totally valuable 
skills that I learned through the creative writing 
program.”

If you’re into the electronic dance music (EDM) scene, 
then surely you’ve listened to Zedd’s new album, Clarity. 
If you don’t know what all the fuss is about concerning 
EDM, then get to an iTunes store and check this album 
out.
If you’re just starting to dip your toes into this music 
scene, Anton Zaslavski — better known by his stage 
name Zedd — is a good place to start. The 23-year-
old Russian-German music producer and DJ has a 
crisp, clean sound that still manages to hit those deep, 
reverberating bass notes that are oh-so satisfying.
Zedd’s debut album Clarity was released in early 
October through Interscope Records. Before releasing 
the album, Zedd released singles through OWSLA, 
Skrillex’s record label, and went on worldwide tours with 
Porter Robinson, Lady Gaga, and others.
After releasing great singles like “Shave It” and “Stars 
Come Out” — as well as making sick remixes for the 
likes of Fatboy Slim, The Black Eyed Peas, Wolfgang 
Gartner, and Swedish House Ma?a — it’s about time 
that this rising star released his own album.
Clarity is unique in its coherent message. It’s an actual 
album, with a ?ow and a consistent theme that’s hard to 
?nd in a world full of EDM singles and LPs. Many EDM 
artists have a hard time creating albums, since often 
they don’t need to release albums as long as they’re 
coming out with singles and booking tour dates.
But if you listen to Clarity in order, from “Hourglass” to 
“Epos,” it becomes clear that Zedd was aiming to create 
a speci?c musical experience in those 45 minutes. By 
the end of the album, you feel as if you’ve listened to one 
of his live sets, not 10 different songs.
“Hourglass,” which incorporates the sounds of clocks 
ticking, imperceptibly ?ows into the next song, “Shave It 
Up.” Many of the songs — “Codec,” “Stache,” and “Epos” 
in particular — have Zedd’s signature bass timbres, 
making the sound crisp, gnarly, and satisfying.
Two especially grooving house tunes that appear 
back-to-back on the album are “Fall Into Sky” featuring 
Ellie Goulding and “Follow You Down” featuring Bright 
Lights. The vocals and subject matter of the lyrics make 
the two songs ?ow together almost seamlessly.
Zedd’s lead singles, “Spectrum” and “Clarity,” do a good 
job of representing the feel of the album as a whole. 
“Spectrum,” lauded as Zedd’s best work when it came 
out over the summer, is a beautiful song with great lyrics 
and spectacular beats. The version of “Spectrum” in the 
album is shortened, but the extended version is available 
on iTunes.
Zedd stands apart from many EDM DJs because of his 
origins: He’s a classically trained musician who started 
playing the piano and drums at age four. Take that, 
Justin Bieber.
Making a good EDM album is hard work, but with 
Zedd’s classical training, he’s managed to create 
something worthwhile in Clarity.

Sylvester Stallone leads his merry band of warriors into 
a sea of box of?ce success in The Expendables 2. As a 
follow-up to its predecessor, The Expendables 2 is an 
improvement. In this next installment, a basic mission 
turns into a quest for revenge against a villain who 
possesses a dangerous weapon. You’ll get a cute dash 
of self reference here and there, mostly to balance out 
the violence. Cameos abound, and most of the humor 
really does work. But for anyone besides the most 
casual moviegoer, The Expendables 2 is just a lot of

childhood, Mark Wahlberg’s character struggles with his 
adulthood and the effects of his friendship with Ted, his 
walking, talking, sentient teddy bear. Of course, this is 
MacFarlane’s movie, so the stuffed bear would obviously 
buy a few prostitutes, use cocaine, and be Wahlberg’s 
redeemer. The script is mildly funny in the way that 
everything MacFarlane has ever done is mildly funny, but 
the ?lm is damaged by its creator’s seemingly boundless

Magic Mike is the best head-fake of the year. Veteran 
director Stephen Soderbergh (Ocean’s Eleven, 
Contagion) takes an exploitation picture that aims 
to make bank off Channing Tatum’s abs and turns it 
into a deft economic rumination. Tatum gives a truly 
nuanced and effective performance as a 19-year-old 
who turns to stripping in a rough economy, and Matthew 
McConaughey contributes another great supporting 
turn in what has been his year of resurgence. Carnegie 
Mellon alumnus Matt Bomer (CFA ’00) also makes an 
appearance as Tatum’s stripper colleague. As usual, 
Soderbergh goes overboard with his color palette, but 
it’s a small complaint in this year’s best blockbuster.

The Carnegie Mellon School of Drama has received 
its ?rst ever National Endowments for the Humanities 
(NEH) grant, thanks to the research proposal of associate 
professor of dramatic literature Wendy Arons and her 
group of collaborators. The project, which will translate 
German philosopher Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s 
Hamburgische Dramaturgie, is focused on both theater 
theory and translation, and has signi?cant value in both 
?elds.
The Award
Arons and three other scholars from around the country 
received a grant for $289,697 from the NEH’s Scholarly 
Editions and Translations Program. According to the 
NEH website, this program supports the “preparation 
of editions and translations of pre-existing texts and 
documents of value to the humanities that are currently 
inaccessible or available in inadequate editions.” 
Arons’ project ?ts this description perfectly, since 
only an incomplete English version of Hamburgische 
Dramaturgie is currently available: Not all of the 101 
essays from the book have been translated, and those 
that have are missing signi?cant parts.
Arons, a dedicated scholar of 18th-century German 
theater, had the idea for the project when a colleague 
mentioned that the current English translation of 
Hamburgische Dramaturgie was incomplete. “That was 
actually a surprise to me at the time ... and that piqued 
my interest. So at that point, I thought, it really is time for 
a new translation, and a complete one,” Arons said.
The Original Text
Hamburgische Dramaturgie is one of the most signi?cant 
historical texts in the dramaturgy ?eld; in fact, Lessing 
coined the term “dramaturgy,” earning himself the title 
“the father of modern dramaturgy.”
Hamburgische Dramaturgie also has a fascinating 
historical context. The collection consists of 101 essays 
that Lessing wrote during his time with the Hamburg 
National Theatre, which was created in 1767 by a 
group of businessmen in Hamburg, Germany. Prior to 
then, most performances in the area were presented 
by traveling troupes. “You didn’t have, at that time in 
Germany, any sort of house where normal, ordinary 
citizens could go and see the theater any week of the 
year,” Arons explained. “So they instituted this in 
Hamburg.”
Lessing, a prominent playwright and dramatist, was 
brought into the Hamburg National Theatre as a 
consultant and artistic director, where he spent his time 
School of Drama wins its ?rst NEH grant
Associate professor sets out to translate G.E. Lessing’s historic Hamburgische Dramaturgie
by Allison Cosby | Staffwriter[]
While an undergraduate student, Arons studied abroad 
in East Germany and went on to study dramaturgy 
and the German language in graduate school at the 
University of California, San Diego, keeping her research 
focused on 18th-century German theater.
“It’s an interesting time in history,” Arons said. “It’s the 
time when everything is changing, when they’re moving 
from this moment of the actors as traveling troupes who 
have no status in society to actors as celebrities and as 
established ?gures in society.” Arons even wrote her ?rst 
book on the implications of the transition for women in 
the 18th century.
Arons and Michael Chemers of the University of 
California, Santa Cruz, who used to be a colleague of 
Arons’ at Carnegie Mellon, originally applied for the NEH 
grant in 2010. Despite a mostly positive response, their 
?rst proposal was rejected because it was too huge of a 
project for just one translator. So Arons and Chemers 
decided to bring a few more scholars into the project, 
getting Natalya Baldyga of Tufts University and 
independent scholar Sara Figal to join. After reapplying 
last fall, they were awarded the grant in August.
The Translation
With the complete group of scholars, the project really 
began to take shape. They were offered a publishing 
deal and decided to digitally publish as they went, much 
like how Lessing published his essays as he wrote them. 
“In many ways, if Lessing were alive today, he’d be 
blogging,” Arons said. “We wanted to give him that 
opportunity to blog.”
Since their goal is simply to make the text accessible to 
students and scholars, “Our original thought was, ‘Let’s 
just get this out there,’ because it doesn’t exist. Even 
the ?rst essay [in the current translation] is missing 
three sentences. So someone who doesn’t read German 
immediately doesn’t have access to what he’s really 
written,” Arons said. To achieve this goal, the scholars 
will publish the translated essays on mediacommons.
org, a peer-to-peer website that allows readers to give 
feedback on the translations.
“It’s scary because we’re putting our work out there 
mostly ?nished, but not completely ?nished, and people 
will be able to see our mistakes... but at the same time, 
we thought this would allow us to make it a better work 
in the end,” Arons said.
Arons and her colleagues hope that getting feedback 
as they work will only make their work better and more 
accurate. Additionally, this back-and-forth between 
translators and readers is something Arons feels that 
Lessing would appreciate. “It’s sort of in the spirit in his 
own way of doing stuff,” she explained. “He got a lot of 
feedback on his writing at the time, and he loved the 
back-and-forth. So we thought we’d sort of honor him in 
that way, by being brave and putting it out there even 
though we might be embarrassed by it.”
Arons’ three-year Hamburgische Dramaturgie 
translation project is signi?cant to both those interested

critiquing works. “He wrote essays about and critiqued 
what he saw on stage, and he used these essays as a 
way to formulate a theory of what good theater should 
be,” Arons said.
Lessing’s essays were published over the course of his 
two years with the Hamburg National Theatre, which 
dissolved in 1769. It closed for a number of reasons, 
including the actors’ dislike of Lessing’s public criticism 
of the theater. His essays were eventually published 
together in a book, which, according to Arons, has since 
“stood as an example of how critical writing can re?ect 
on media and what media does in society.”
The Researchers
Diving into this area of research is natural for Arons,  
who has researched 18th-century German theater since 
she was an undergraduate student at Yale University. 
“I actually didn’t start learning German until college,” 
Arons said; before then, she had only read a few 
translated books and been interested in the culture. 
in translation and those interested in theater theory, a 
duality that makes the project particularly appealing. 
“The work can stand for more than just its historical 
value or its value as theater theory,” Arons said. “It can 
also stand as an example of how scholarship works in 
the real world.”“”
In many ways, if Lessing were alive today, he’d be 
blogging. We wanted to give him that opportunity to blog.

Have you ever spent too much time looking at image 
macros on the internet, or scrolling through videos 
of cats on Youtube? Many people regard these 
diversions as pointless yet amusing wastes of time, 
much like other aspects of today’s digital culture.
New York-based artist Cory Arcangel, however, 
?nds something of artistic merit in American digital 
culture. Arcangel uses mostly ready-made digital 
technology in his art. In a sense, his artwork is a 
subset of pop art — taking elements from popular 
culture and giving them a twist — but its heavy 
emphasis on the digital era makes his approach 
more unique. In his work, Arcangel also uses hacked 
and obsolete pieces of technology, such as old video 
game cartridges.
Cory Arcangel: Masters, a new exhibit at the 
Carnegie Museum of Art, shows off selected pieces 
of art that Arcangel has produced over his decade-
long career, including ?ve videos, a modi?ed video 
game, a modi?ed ?at screen television, a wallpaper 
installation, and a collection of archival materials. 
The exhibit, which opened on Saturday, also debuts 
a new work: Arcangel’s collection of catalogued 
trance and techno LPs.
Like other pieces of modern art, some elements 
of Arcangel’s work may come off as somewhat 
overrated. One work featured in the exhibit, 
“Super Mario Clouds,” simply displays the sky and 
background clouds from the game Super Mario Bros. 
— nothing else.
But the exhibit still has its merits. Few people in 
modern art address the values and concerns of the 
digital age, despite its growing in?uence on our 
culture and society. Above all, Arcangel’s work is a 
commentary on American culture in the digital era. 
His pieces highlight how most of the technology 
we use quickly becomes obsolete in our consumer 
culture; every year there is a newer, fancier iPhone 
or tablet that quickly becomes replaceable.
Many of the works in the exhibit focus on the 
transient and pointless nature of technology. The 
work “Untitled Translation Exercise” is basically 
a showing of the 1993 American ?lm Dazed and 
Confused, but with the script dubbed by an 
outsourced Indian ?rm. The odd juxtaposition 
of the depiction of American culture with the 
stilted, wooden voices of the foreign ?rm create 
an interesting commentary on the outsourcing of 
American labor and the effects of globalization on 
American culture. Moreover, it’s incredibly funny to 
watch.
In an interview posted on the Carnegie Museum of 
Art website, exhibit curator Tina Kukielski describes 
Arcangel and his work: “I’ve always thought of 
Cory as a cultural purveyor. He is an artist who 
understands the mechanisms and systems of 
technology and the internet and is able to intervene 
in the slightest way in the sense that he upsets the 
rhythms or patterns of culture just enough to expose 
their very being.”
