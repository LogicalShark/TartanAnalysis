A ?nal goodbye to beloved beep boop
Hebert talks new job as SCS dean
JACOB PAUL
Layout Manager
Welcome back to the land 
of meal blocks, hard classes, 
high stakes and long nights. 
Something, however,  has 
changed since you were last 
here.
For years, the traffic lights 
at the intersection of campus’s 
busiest intersection — Forbes 
and Moorewood — emitted a 
beeping tone when the walking 
signal flashed. “Beep boop, beep 
boop,” it rang, sounding like an 
automated bird chirp.
The beeping tone was 
recognized far and wide as 
a welcome to campus. Many 
students came to refer to the 
intersection as “the beep boop.”
The traffic tone was designed 
and installed to help blind and 
visually impaired people know 
when it is safe to cross the street. 
Devices like these are known as 
accessible pedestrian signals. 
The beep boop was “assuredly” 
installed at the request of the 
Blind and Vision Rehabilita-
tion Services of Pittsburgh, an 
organization that was once 
based on Craig Street, according 
a statement by the School of 
Computer Science to The Tartan 
via their twitter account.
Rumors that “the beep boop” 
would soon meet its end swirled 
around campus during finals 
week of the most recent spring 
semester. The steel poles that 
held up the traffic lights and 
walk signs had grown rusty. And 
they looked a bit out of place 
next to the newly renovated 
walkway leading into campus.
In July, new traffic lights and 
walk signs were installed on 
shiny black beams, and the old 
signs were removed. The “beep 
boop” was replaced with a re-
cording of walking instructions.
Students mourned. “Over-
heard at Carnegie Mellon”, a 
Facebook page popular among 
Carnegie Mellon students and 
alumni, was flooded posts about 
the traffic chime’s removal.
They started on July 24. Maya 
Greenholt, a junior psychology 
major, posted a picture of a 
construction crew installing the 
new lights. The caption read 
“The last beep boop.” Over 1,100 
people reacted to the post, 761 
with a crying emoji.
“Let’s all scream beep boop as 
we cross the street to keep it alive 
for ever,” declared Cali Colliver, 
a junior, just hours later.
“Does anyone have a re-
cording of the Beep Boop?” 
asked Aaron Satyanarayana, a 
sophomore.
By July 25, the fence was 
painted as a tribute to the beep 
boop. “You’ve beeped your last 
boop,” it read between the posts.
Carnegie Mellon featured 
photographs of the fence on 
their official Instagram page, 
along with a recording of the 
traffic chime. “Turn on your 
audio & you’ll be able to hear 
our old friend anytime,” the post 
read.
“Anyone know how to hack a 
walk sign system?” asked Lucas 
Moiseyev, an ECE major, in a 
post on the Overheard CMU 
Facebook page. 
“Dude you could probably 
figure it out,” said Vicki 
Posnanski, a senior in 
Mechanical Engineering. “I 
wrote a paper about transporta-
tion infrastructure for my cyber 
security class and road signs are 
ridiculously easy.”
The accessible pedestrian 
system ended up developing an 
obsessive, cult-like following. 
To some, this just seems like 
another day at Carnegie Mellon. 
Nick Marotta, a junior Design 
major, said he saw the posts as 
a “pervasive reminder that I 
was at Carnegie Mellon.” “They 
made me laugh,” he added.
Others were frustrated by the 
hysteria. Peter Rezk, a senior 
philosophy major, called atten-
tion in an interview to what he 
saw as a lack of empathy.
“Carnegie Mellon University 
culture is everybody losing they 
minds over a crosswalk sound 
being removed and SILENCE 
when Antwon Rose’s killer 
escapes Justice in Pittsburgh,” 
said Rezk in his post.
Rezk’s post was deleted by 
the moderators of Overheard, 
prompting a series of outrage and 
criticism that was also deleted. 
Overheard’s moderators ex-
plained that they deleted the post 
because “wasn’t overheard,” and 
“the comments were extremely 
vicious.”
“Now, when I cross the street 
it feels strange not to hear it,” 
said Marotta. In the beep boop’s 
heyday, students living in the 
nearby Morewood E Tower often 
complained about being kept 
up at night. But Marotta, who 
lived in E Tower during his ?rst 
year, says that the noise never 
bothered him. “It sort of ended 
up blending in with the cicadas 
and birds,” he explained.
And therein lies the problem 
with the beloved traf?c chime. It 
blended in, and wasn’t working 
well for people who depended 
on it.
In fact, “Cuckoo-chirp” style 
Access Pedestrian signals like 
the beep boop were designed to 
resemble bird calls in an effort to 
avoid causing a disruption to the 
public.
Research sponsored by 
the National Cooperative 
Highway Research program in 
1998 found that “people had 
difficulty remembering which 
tone was for which direction, 
often didn’t know which direc-
tion they were traveling, and 
that birds sometimes mimicked 
the chirp sound.” And according 
to the American Council for the 
Blind, “Cuckoo-chirp” signals 
are no longer the recommended 
standard.
By instructing people to 
“cross Forbes Avenue,” the newly 
installed traffic chime is an 
improvement for those who rely 
on it. Polara, a leading manufac-
turer of crossing sound systems, 
says that “[accessible pedes-
trian systems] have also proven 
to benefit to all pedestrians,” 
especially children.
So although the beloved 
sound is gone, far from all is lost.
Over the summer, expansion and change to the campus
ADAM TUNNARD
News Editor
While most undergraduate 
students are gone over the sum-
mer, Carnegie Mellon’s Division 
of Operations get a chance to 
renovate, construct, and expand. 
This summer has been no differ-
ent. Ralph Horgan, Associate Vice 
President of Carnegie Mellon’s 
Campus Design and Facility 
Development (CDFD), says they’re 
“racing to the ?nish” to get a vari-
ety of operations done before this 
semester begins.
Two of the most notable 
changes to campus will be the 
newly built ANSYS Hall and the 
ongoing construction of TCS Hall. 
The 36,000 square foot ANSYS 
Hall sits between Scaife and Porter 
Hall, and will serve the College of 
Engineering.
TCS Hall, across Forbes Avenue 
from the Integrated Innovation 
Institute, will house new facili-
ties for the School of Comput-
er Science, with space for the 
Institute for Software Research, 
the Human Computer Interaction 
Institute, and the computational 
?nance program. Horgan says the 
top ?oor will also serve as a “col-
laborative space.” They’re hoping 
construction on the building will 
be done by the Spring of 2020.
Carnegie Mellon is also 
currently branching into other 
areas of Pittsburgh real estate. 
This past July, Mill 19—a former 
steel mill-turned research and 
development center—opened in 
Hazelwood Green, about 2 miles 
south of campus.
The 190,000 square foot Mill 
19 facility is home to a partner-
ship with the Advanced Robot-
ics for Manufacturing group, a 
not-for-pro?t seeking to address 
“workforce development issues,” 
according to the partnership’s an-
nouncement. It will also house 
the College of Engineering’s 
Manufacturing Futures Initiative. 
Horgan says the space is large, 
“kind of like the National Robotics 
and Engineering Center,” and fea-
tures a ten-ton crane.
Another expansion beyond our 
original campus came last year 
when Carnegie Mellon purchased 
Fifth Neville Apartments, an ac-
quisition that displaced then-ten-
ants of the building. Horgan says 
they’re now working to renovate 
that building, bringing it up to 
Americans with Disabilities Act 
code, addressing safety concerns, 
installing Carnegie Mellon wire-
less interent, renovating ?ooring, 
and providing aesthetic upgrades. 
He says the new Carnegie Mellon 
housing option will be open one 
year from now.
The Melwood Avenue 
acquisition last year, which will 
be a new space for the College of 
Fine Arts and the Miller Institute, 
is not “not fully ?eshed out” as of 
yet, Horgan says.

As of Aug. 15, Carnegie 
Mellon’s School of Computer 
Science (SCS) has a new dean.
Martial Hebert, the former 
head of the Robotics Institute, 
was selected for the position by 
the 20-member Dean Search 
Committee, co-chaired by Profes-
sor Lorrie Cranor and Machine 
Learning Department head Roni 
Rosenfeld, with help from the 
executive search firm Isaacson, 
Miller.
Hebert will take over for 
former head Andrew Moore, 
who stepped down at the end 
of 2018 to rejoin Google as the 
head of its Cloud AI project. 
As the new dean, Hebert will 
oversee the seven departments 
making up SCS, including the 
Institute for Software Research 
(ISR), the computer science de-
partment, the Machine Learning 
department (ML), and Hebert’s 
own Robotics Institute (RI).
The Tartan sat down with 
Hebert last week to discuss his 
new role and his vision for the 
future of SCS. Hebert, who has 
been with RI since 1984, sees his 
appointment as an opportunity 
to “understand and appreciate all 
of the disciplines,” and connect 
those disciplines to the broader 
research being done at Carnegie 
Mellon. “I would love to see CS, 
and what we do in SCS, connect-
ing to everything, basically…
[not] just in terms of computer 
science providing a toolbox…
[but] being able to link those 
tools, those ideas…to create new 
field[s], new disciplines.”
Hebert’s focus on 
interdisciplinary applications 
of computer science dovetails 
with that of Carnegie Mellon 
president Farnham Jahanian, 
whose bio describes Jahanian’s 
expertise in “advancing research 
and education within and across 
disciplines.” Hebert’s exper-
tise extends in particular to 
artificial intelligence, the newest 
undergraduate major in SCS.
Hebert hopes to integrate AI 
technology into other research 
areas on campus by “looking at AI 
plus ‘X’…going further than just 
AI applied to ‘X’. Rather, seeing

ClassInSight analyzes lecture behavior    
NORA MATTSON
Editor-in-Chief
40 classrooms on the Carnegie 
Mellon campus have two cameras 
mounted on white plastic high on 
the walls, one pointed towards 
the professor at the front, and one 
looking, like the professor herself 
might be, back at the students.
Most of the cameras and 
sensors around Carnegie Mellon 
have a little email pasted some-
where near them, for passersby to 
ask about the kinds of information 
that might be collected. The note 
above these classroom cameras 
directs onlookers to the organizers 
of the ClassInSight project.
ClassInSight uses these 
cameras to generate stick ?gures 
of all of the people in class, which 
turn into data about things like 
where a professor’s gaze is direct-
ed, whether they hold a pause af-
ter asking a question, or how many 
students raise their hands.
A group of Carnegie Mellon 
human-computer interaction 
researchers, in collaboration with 
the school, the registrar, and the 
university’s Eberly Center for 
Teaching Excellence & Educational 
Innovation began this project 
in 2015 with the purpose of 
generating automated reports to 
give professors feedback on their 
teaching styles.
“One of the issues that college 
instructors have, that high school 
teachers often don’t, is that we are 
expected to teach without having 
a degree in education,” said Amy 
Ogan, Thomas and Lydia Moran 
Assistant Professor of Learning 
Science, who heads the project. 
ClassInSight prompts professors 
with strategies based on collected 
data to encourage class engage-
ment and discussion, which can be 
rare in large college lectures.
Motivated teachers can ask the 
Eberly Center to send someone 
in to sit on their lectures, and 
receive feedback. But Ogan says 
that though this might be a helpful 
resource, it happens at most once 
a semester, while the ClassInSight 
system can provide daily feedback.
The project team includes 
Ogan, David Gerritsen, a 
researcher at the Eberly Center, 
John Zimmerman and Chris 
Harrison at the Human-Computer 
Interaction Institute, and Yuvraj 
Agarwal from the School of 
Computer Science. The project 
received a ?ve-year, $2.5 mil-
lion dollar research grant in 2018 
from the James S. McDonnell 
Foundation’s Teachers as Learners 
program.
The McDonnell Foundation 
grant focuses on improvements 
to K-12 education, expanding the 
scope of ClassInSight out of the 
college classroom. Unlike college 
professors, there is “pressure 
in high school for teachers’ 
performance to be observed and 
calculated as, for instance, part 
of whether they are hired again,” 
which, Ogan says, can lead them 
to be wary of measures that might 
After 19 years outside of Posner, Joe from Joe’s Doghouse moves on  
JACOB PAUL
Contributing Editor
For nearly 19 years, Joe’s 
Doghouse was a ?xture on 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus. 
Monday though Friday, smoke 
curled up from the little cart 
stationed at the corner of 
Margaret Morrison Ave. and Tech 
St. Sometimes, the red and white 
paneled umbrellas above the cart 
glowed in the sunlight.
Joe Colaneri of Joe’s Doghouse 
has moved on, and his hot dog 
stand has moved with him. He’s 
now at his new job, as a manager 
at the Jimmy John’s in Squirrel 
Hill. The hot dog stand has yet to 
see its last dog — Joe is planning 
to continue catering events here 
and there — but it will no longer 
be operating during lunch hours 
on campus.
Professors and students alike 
would queue for the food at Joe’s 
Doghouse daily. During lunch 
rushes between classes the line 
would get long. On a good day, 
Joe once estimated, he prepared 
around 150 hot dogs.
The selection wasn’t limited 
just to your standard dog. There 
were Chicago-style dogs, chicken 
club sandwiches, Kielbasa, and 
vegetarian options too. A bacon 
cheeseburger topped with lettuce, 
tomato, ketchup, mustard and 
Lay’s potato chips was known far 
and wide as The Crunch Burger. 
But the best-seller by far was the 
Puppy Love; two beef hot dogs, a 
drink, and a bag of chips for ?ve 
dollars.
The hot dogs were grilled 
— crispy on the outside but not 
overdone — like a hot dog should 
be. But what brought students 
back, as much as anything else, 
was Joe’s friendliness and easy 
conversation.
Tiffany Lai, a 2019 alum of the 
design school, often ate at the hot 
dog stand before her classes in the 
nearby Margaret Morrison Hall, 
known affectionately as Maggie 
Mo. “He was always incredibly 
friendly and his burgers were 
delicious,” said Lai. “Maggie Mo 
de?nitely isn’t the same without 
seeing Joe in front of it!”
In May, the School of 
Architecture presented Joe with 
an award for the school’s favorite 
hot dog establishment. Recently, 
Carnegie Mellon President 
Farnam Jahanian invited Joe to 
his of?ce to thank him and pres-
ent him with a token of appre-
ciation from the University, ac-
cording to an email from Jason 
Maderer, the senior director of 
Carnegie Mellon News and Mar-
keting Relations.
Treating people with courtesy 
and respect is important to Joe, 
ever since his mother taught him 
to do so at a young age. She was 
“a single mother who worked very 
hard to work two or three jobs,” 
Joe said.
Over the years Joe served 
hot dogs to a number of 
notable ?gures, including 
Nobel laureates, college deans, 
and Hillary Clinton’s secret 
service, when Clinton spoke in 
Skibo Gymnasium during 2016 
campaign. However, he said that 
he values his relationships with 
the students the most.
“I loved everybody there,” said 
Joe. “When I met parents that 
were on tours I always told them, 
you see, ‘I don’t think I ever met a 
bad CMU student.’”
Joe and his wife Chris hired 
students to help run the stand. 
Though most have graduated, 
many have kept in touch.
He started looking for other 
work because business during 
summer sessions has been slow 
in recent years. When he got the 
offer for the manager position at 
Jimmy John’s, it was an offer he 
couldn’t turn down.
“It is time for me to move on 
and ?nd a different passion,” 
wrote Joe in a heartfelt post on the 
hot dog stand’s Instagram page, 
@joesdoghouse_cmu. “Thank 
you again for making these years 
so meaningful...”
It’s been about two decades 
since Joe and Chris were 
vacationing in Cape May and 
noticed the street vendors, setting 
off a light bulb in their heads: 
they should start a hot dog stand.
Since 2002, Joe has served 
food on Carnegie Mellon’s campus 
nearly every day. He worked the 
hot dog stand year-round, and 
persisted through grey skies, rain, 
and snow storms. So, working 
at Jimmy John’s is a big change 
for him. But he said that Jimmy 
John’s has made the transition 
“pretty easy” for him. Joe gets 
to work at 6:30 in the morning 
to open the restaurant, and his 
co-workers don’t want to be there 
at 6:30 in the morning, so “it’s 
working out pretty well,” he said.
“I have no complaints, but I do 
miss CMU,” said Joe. “I knew there 
would be some times when I’d be 
a little sad about not being there.” 
But right now Joe is focused on 
what’s next: sandwiches. “I try 
to make it a point that I live in 
the moment and I try not to look 
back.”

Two of the most popular 
dining locations on campus, The 
Schatz Dining Room and The 
Exchange, closed their doors 
for renovations earlier this year. 
Schatz will reopen its doors next 
week on Sept. 18, according to 
Dining Services. The Exchange 
will reopen on Nov. 4.
Renovations for Schatz and 
The Exchange are just two of the 
Dining Services capital projects 
that align with their strategic 
plan, according to Pascal Petter, 
director of Dining Services.
“We continuously look for ways 
to improve the dining program for 
our campus community,” Petter 
said. “That’s a major goal we have 
each year. This year, we focused 
on renovating two popular on-
campus dining locations.”
Renovation projects
The Schatz Dining Room will 
now feature a more fast-casual 
concept with “elevated service, 
?exible seating, and an open-
kitchen concept,” Petter said.
The new Schatz will feature 
a built-in teaching kitchen, an 
area of the dining room that can 
be transformed into a space for 
hands-on culinary classes. This 
space will be used for monthly 
classes open to all students, 
faculty, and staff. While class 
offerings have not yet been 
solidi?ed, the schedule will be 
posted on the dining website in 
Oct.
Schatz will continue to provide 
all-you-care-to-eat breakfast and 
dinner on weekdays, as well as 
brunch on weekends, and serve 
as a faculty and staff and gradu-
ate student dining room Monday 
through Friday. The menu will 
still include hot entrees with 
sides, a made-to-order salad bar, 
soup, sandwiches, and desserts.
Jessica Tones, a registered 
dietitian, nutrition educator, and 
marketing coordinator for Dining 
Services, added that Schatz will 
center around a seasonal “cycle” 
menu with an emphasis on local 
and sustainable sourcing.
“The same dish may be shown 
every third week,” Tones said. “It 
helps ?t the needs of our students, 
but it also helps our vendors make 
what they are best at making. 
They can be innovative but still 
keep the favorite dishes that are 
close to many people’s hearts.”
The Exchange will also reopen 
after summer-long renovations. 
The space will see an “entirely 
new look,” according to Petter.
“Queuing has been dramati-
cally improved,” Petter added. 
“There’s now an open-kitchen en-
vironment so the community can 
see how their food is prepared. 
There’s a much better experience 
overall.”
The dining location will 
feature a dedicated coffee bar and 
grab-and-go items, along with a 
sandwich station, salad bar, and 
hot food.
To accommodate for the two 
major renovation projects, Dining 
Services opened two additional 
temporary dining locations with 
options similar to Schatz and The 
Exchange.
Of those two, the Tartan 
Pavilion is a modi?ed all-you-
care-to-eat location near Resnik 
House, open until Sept. 15. The 
Exchange has been operating in a 
pop-up café outside of the Purnell 
Center for the Arts, open until

Welcome back to the land 
of meal blocks, hard classes, 
high stakes and long nights.

changed since you were last 
here.

Blind, “Cuckoo-chirp” signals 
are no longer the recommended 
standard.
By instructing people to 
“cross Forbes Avenue,” the newly 
installed traffic chime is an 
improvement for those who rely 
on it. Polara, a leading manufac-
turer of crossing sound systems, 
says that “[accessible pedes-
trian systems] have also proven 
to benefit to all pedestrians,” 
especially children.
So although the beloved 
sound is gone, far from all is lost.
Over the summer, expansion and change to the campus

While most undergraduate 
students are gone over the sum-
mer, Carnegie Mellon’s Division 
of Operations get a chance to 
renovate, construct, and expand. 
This summer has been no differ-
ent. Ralph Horgan, Associate Vice 
President of Carnegie Mellon’s 
Campus Design and Facility 
Development (CDFD), says they’re 
“racing to the ?nish” to get a vari-
ety of operations done before this 
semester begins.
Two of the most notable 
changes to campus will be the 
newly built ANSYS Hall and the 
ongoing construction of TCS Hall. 
The 36,000 square foot ANSYS 
Hall sits between Scaife and Porter 
Hall, and will serve the College of 
Engineering.
TCS Hall, across Forbes Avenue 
from the Integrated Innovation 
Institute, will house new facili-
ties for the School of Comput-
er Science, with space for the 
Institute for Software Research, 
the Human Computer Interaction 
Institute, and the computational 
?nance program. Horgan says the 
top ?oor will also serve as a “col-
laborative space.” They’re hoping 
construction on the building will 
be done by the Spring of 2020.
Carnegie Mellon is also 
currently branching into other 
areas of Pittsburgh real estate. 
This past July, Mill 19—a former 
steel mill-turned research and 
development center—opened in 
Hazelwood Green, about 2 miles 
south of campus.
The 190,000 square foot Mill 
19 facility is home to a partner-
ship with the Advanced Robot-
ics for Manufacturing group, a 
not-for-pro?t seeking to address 
“workforce development issues,” 
according to the partnership’s an-
nouncement. It will also house 
the College of Engineering’s 
Manufacturing Futures Initiative. 
Horgan says the space is large, 
“kind of like the National Robotics 
and Engineering Center,” and fea-
tures a ten-ton crane.
Another expansion beyond our 
original campus came last year 
when Carnegie Mellon purchased 
Fifth Neville Apartments, an ac-
quisition that displaced then-ten-
ants of the building. Horgan says 
they’re now working to renovate 
that building, bringing it up to 
Americans with Disabilities Act 
code, addressing safety concerns, 
installing Carnegie Mellon wire-
less interent, renovating ?ooring, 
and providing aesthetic upgrades. 
He says the new Carnegie Mellon 
housing option will be open one 
year from now.
The Melwood Avenue 
acquisition last year, which will 
be a new space for the College of 
Fine Arts and the Miller Institute, 
is not “not fully ?eshed out” as of 
yet, Horgan says.
On campus, projects have

As of Aug. 15, Carnegie 
Mellon’s School of Computer 
Science (SCS) has a new dean.
Martial Hebert, the former 
head of the Robotics Institute, 
was selected for the position by 
the 20-member Dean Search 
Committee, co-chaired by Profes-
sor Lorrie Cranor and Machine 
Learning Department head Roni 
Rosenfeld, with help from the 
executive search firm Isaacson, 
Miller.
Hebert will take over for 
former head Andrew Moore, 
who stepped down at the end 
of 2018 to rejoin Google as the 
head of its Cloud AI project. 
As the new dean, Hebert will 
oversee the seven departments 
making up SCS, including the 
Institute for Software Research 
(ISR), the computer science de-
partment, the Machine Learning 
department (ML), and Hebert’s 
own Robotics Institute (RI).
The Tartan sat down with 
Hebert last week to discuss his 
new role and his vision for the 
future of SCS. Hebert, who has 
been with RI since 1984, sees his 
appointment as an opportunity 
to “understand and appreciate all 
of the disciplines,” and connect 
those disciplines to the broader 
research being done at Carnegie 
Mellon. “I would love to see CS, 
and what we do in SCS, connect-
ing to everything, basically…
[not] just in terms of computer 
science providing a toolbox…
[but] being able to link those 
tools, those ideas…to create new 
field[s], new disciplines.”
Hebert’s focus on 
interdisciplinary applications 
of computer science dovetails 
with that of Carnegie Mellon 
president Farnham Jahanian, 
whose bio describes Jahanian’s 
expertise in “advancing research 
and education within and across 
disciplines.” Hebert’s exper-
tise extends in particular to 
artificial intelligence, the newest 
undergraduate major in SCS.
Hebert hopes to integrate AI 
technology into other research 
areas on campus by “looking at AI 
plus ‘X’…going further than just 
AI applied to ‘X’. Rather, seeing

Environmental Health and Safety promotes Fire Safety Month
JAMES HAGERTY
Staffwriter
Over the month of September, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Environmental 
Health and Safety department 
is hosting a number of events 
to highlight Campus Fire Safety 
Month, an extension of their stated 
guiding principles: “to support the 
University’s mission and values by 
sustaining and enhancing a safe 
and healthy environment for the 
Carnegie Mellon community.”
Mary Sickles, training and 
communications specialist for 
Environmental Health and Safety, 
told The Tartan that “there’s a 
national campus Fire Safety Month 
and organization. It’s all about rais-
ing awareness, these events weren’t 
prompted by any particular issues. 
It’s important that students are 
aware of ?re hazards and ?re 
prevention in the areas where 
they reside and work, like labs and 
makerspaces.”
Primarily, Environmental 
Health and Safety wants to 
spread awareness of ?re hazards 
and ?re escapes, Sickles says. 
Steve Lane, Fire Safety Specialist 
at Environmental Health and 
Safety emphasized, “treat every 
?re alarm like it’s the real thing, 
always evacuate when it goes off, 
and listen to your RA’s and ?oor 
marshals who can help you exit 
the building safely. Nobody gets in 
trouble for reporting an accident or 
?re, and we want to know as soon 
as possible.”
Though the events started 
with a humble Fire Safety Month 
discussion and trivia panel last 
Wednesday, future events are to 
be more hands-on, like the ?re 
extinguisher training event by the 
Fence next Tuesday. Sickles and 
Lane were excited to detail the 
nuance there is to ?re extinguishers, 
some of which will be covered in 
their upcoming event.
Sickles explained, “We focus 
on the different types of ?re 
extinguishers, and how to actually 
use them on a simulated ?re.” The 
simulated ?re is presented on a 
screen that responds to a mock 
extinguisher pointing a green laser 
at it.
Lane made sure to address a 
common misconception, that all 
?re extinguishers are the same. 
“We have water extinguishers 
for Class A ?res, we have dry 
chemical extinguishers for Class 
A, B, and C ?res, and we have a 
Carbon Dioxide extinguisher for 
electrical ?res. We even have spe-
cial types of extinguishers for com-
bustible metals like Magnesium, 
Titanium, Sodium, as well as Class 
K extinguishers for kitchen ?res 
caused by things like vegetable 
oils,” he elaborated.
The upcoming Fire Safety Month 
event will be demonstrating on a 
real ?re, made possible through a 
propane fueled contraption. “It’s 
very much safe. It’s a small burner 
that’s electronically controlled, and 
a water extinguisher will be used to 
put out the ?ames,” Lane said.
Lane says he would like 
everybody on campus to sign up for 
a ?re extinguisher training course, 
of which there are a sessions held 
every week. “Courses span various 
departments and are held in areas 
like makerspaces and libraries. 
We can even bring the class to 
you,” he said. He suggested that 
those interested should email 
Environmental Health and Safety.
When asked if the current 
Fire Safety Month initiatives 
have anything to do with cam-
pus modernization and the 
installment of several new build-
ings at Carnegie Mellon, Lane was 
sure to state: “At any time on cam-
puses, it’s good to be aware of ?res 
and the chances of ?res. Fire safety 
is ongoing. It never stops, even in 
the face of Carnegie Mellon mod-
ernization. The biggest thing we 
can do is educate students and 
staff.”
Shailendra Sinyh, director of 
Environmental Health and Safety 
at Carnegie Mellon, said, “we have 
so many students on campus, and 
since it’s the Fall Semester — when 
all the new students have poured 
in — it’s the perfect time to spread 
awareness and teach ?re safety.” 
He emphasized, “student safety is 
our number one priority.”
Oct. when weather permits.
“The Exchange has a great 
relationship with our community, 
and their pop-up has been 
popular,” Petter said. “The staff 
recognizes students, and students 
recognize the staff.”
Cuisine Diversity
Dining Services reopened 
the Tartan Express, a food truck 
near Legacy Plaza, this past 
week. The menu includes fresh 
Mediterranean and Vaad-certi?ed 
Kosher food, open on weekdays.
“What’s unique is that it’s 
Orthodox Kosher,” Petter said. 
“It’s also a Mediterranean cuisine 
that we don’t have widespread 
across campus. There’s already 
long lines for it.”
Tones and Petter both 
acknowledged the increasing 
nationwide importance to 
accommodate dietary needs, 
whether students are Kosher or 
have allergies.
Two years ago, they opened 
Nourish, an allergen-friendly 
kitchen and a “hidden gem,” as 
Tones described. They are hoping 
to expand allergen-friendly dining 
further this year.
“We wanted one place that 
we knew we could totally control 
the process from where the food 
is received, how it’s stored, how 
it’s transported, and how it’s 
prepared,” Tones said, referring to 
Nourish. “We take a lot of time in 
vetting every ingredient that can 
come into the space.”
Sustainability
This year, Chartwells 
Higher Education, the school’s 
primary dining vendor, made 
the switch to using 100 percent 
compostable packaging in Carved 
+ Crafted Catering, as well as 
dining locations including the 
Cohon Center Marketplace, 
Resnik Servery, Schatz Dining 
Room, Maggie Murph Café, and 
Rothberg’s Roasters II.
The initiative will of?cially 
launch at Carved + Crafted later 
this month. “The community can 
feel good that the choices they 
make for themselves and their 
events are sustainable,” Petter 
said.
To showcase the new changes 
and offerings in campus dining, 
Dining Services will be hosting 
their annual free event, Taste 
of the Tartans, on Sept. 24. The 
event will be held from 11 a.m. to 
2 p.m. in Rangos Ballroom.
For more information on 
dining locations, menus, grand 
openings, and other events, 
visiting the Dining Services 
website at www.cmu.edu/dining.
Dining Services seek to modernize offerings
track classroom behaviors.
Though the cameras were 
installed in 40  classrooms 
in 2018, they collect data in 
around 10 to 15 classrooms 
each semester, depending on 
how many instructors want to 
participate.
A couple weeks into a class, 
someone will come in to read 
the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)-approved script, telling 
the students about the type of 
data that is being collected. The 
sensors are turned on for the 
duration of the lecture, collecting 
anonymized information about 
the position, gestures, and 
expressions of the people in the 
classroom.
Most images are deleted after 
the anonymized gesture data is 
recorded. However, while the 
image recognition algorithm is 
being developed, a portion of 
the raw images are stored to be 
reviewed for accuracy. The IRB 
mandates that the extracted 
data be kept for a minimum of 
three years, without identifying 
information about the professor 
or the students.
Students are given an 
opportunity to object, at which 
point the project will not continue 
in the classroom but Ogan says 
few students ever have.
Grace Bae, a junior in the 
statistics and data science 
department, says that she “didn’t 
really think twice” about the 
cameras that are to be turned 
on in her Designing Human 
Centered Software class, since 
the data would be anonymized. 
She says Harrison, her professor 
and ClassInSight researcher, was 
“open and communicative about 
what these cameras would do and 
their purpose.”
Kalvin Chang, a sophomore in 
the School of Computer Science, 
was also not bothered because of 
anonymization, but he “suspect[s] 
some might be creeped out by the 
notion of AI tracking them.”
Very few people, says Ogan, 
have reached out to the email 
listed on the cameras themselves. 
She says this could be because 
people have had a discussion 
about the cameras in their lec-
tures. But also, Ogan continues, 
“There are people counters on all 
of the computer labs on campus,” 
and students might be “getting 
used to” the presence of sensors.
This is the ?rst article in a series 
we’re calling “Sensors at CMU,” 
exploring the projects behind 
the cameras and sensors around 
campus.

You hear it all the time, from 
everyone and from everywhere: 
saving money is important. 
You’re probably overwhelmed by 
the countless tips on how to save 
and how much to save, sometimes 
grappling with con?icting 
opinions.
There’s no denying that 
saving money is a cornerstone of 
?nancial wellness, but the idea 
itself is vague. Since everyone’s 
situation is unique, simply telling 
someone to save their money 
raises a lot of questions, like “how 
much should I save?” or “where 
should I put my savings?” It’s 
wrong to impose some arbitrary 
rule like “everyone should save 
$500 a month,” since some 
people can’t afford that, while for 
$500 isn’t enough for others.
While there is no one-size-
?ts-all formula for determining 
exactly how much you save, 
saving money is less about the 
number itself than the mindset 
behind it. And while there’s a 
lot of debate surrounding the 
principles of successful saving, 
there are a few recurring themes.
First, it’s critical that you have 
a long-term ?nancial goal, where 
long-term means anywhere from 
?ve to 15 years down the line. 
Setting a destination for yourself 
is an important ?rst step because 
if you don’t know where you’re 
going, how are you going to know 
how to get there? A long-term 
?nancial goal is tied directly to 
how much you want to save. 
Say for example you decide that 
you want $25,000 in savings by 
the age of 24. From there, it’s 
a simple calculation to see how 
much you should be saving each 
month. Of course, that would be 
an oversimpli?cation since you 
need to take other aspects of 
your budget into account, but it’s 
the same general idea: you must 
know where the goal is before you 
try to score.
Second, successful saving is 
heavily dependent on discipline. 
Continuously and consistently 
saving while resisting the urge to 
spend your savings is necessary 
for accumulating wealth. While 
saving $50 here or $200 there is a 
good start, it’s important that you 
have a plan in place for when you 
get your paycheck so that saving 
money becomes routine. Start by 
considering necessary expenses 
like housing, clothing, and food, 
as well as your discretionary 
spending on recreation and the 
occasional splurge. Once you 
have that portion of your budget 
?gured out, set in stone how 
much of each paycheck goes 
towards savings, and stick with it, 
so that you’re not tempted while 
dividing the paycheck. Better yet, 
automate savings deposits so that 
you don’t even see the money 
being stored away, almost like it 
doesn’t even exist. Out of sight, 
out of mind.
Third, it’s important to realize 
that saving does not mean 
depriving yourself of the things 
that you enjoy. It might feel that 
way with money being locked 
away that you won’t see for a 
long time but understand that 
even with saving as a part of your 
budget, you can still budget for 
fun. Where you draw the line is up 
to you, so long as a line does exist. 
Plus, reframing the way you think 
about saving so that you view it 
as delayed grati?cation rather 
than deprivation is as important 
as putting money away.
Last, buy fewer things but buy 
the best. This may sound like it’s 
not directly related to the idea 
of saving, but it is. Let’s say that 
you’re in the market for a new 
laptop, and you have options 
ranging from $300 to $800. Now 
based solely off the price, you’d 
be tempted to go for the cheaper 
model because who doesn’t want 
to save an extra few hundred 
dollars? But consider this: how 
long will that laptop last you 
based on the work you’re doing? 
If you know it’s not going to last 
very long and that it’s going to 
burn out rather quickly, buying 
the higher-end longer-lasting 
model might be the better option 
since it eliminates the cost (both 
in money and time) in the near 
future of having to switch laptops. 
Not only will you feel better 
about the possessions you’ve 
consciously chosen to invest in, 
but you’ll also be saving more by 
not having to always hunt around 
for replacements.
These four principles are far 
from exhaustive, but as with 
all things in this column, they 
represent a good starting point. 
Asking yourself these dif?cult 
questions now can help you 
formulate a concrete game plan 
on how to better manage your 
money in the future so that when 
you get that ?rst big paycheck, 
you don’t end up blowing it all on 
temporary thrills.
So now that you have this pile 
of money set aside, where should 
you put it? Most people opt to 
just keep it in a savings account 
through their bank, but as we’ll 
see next week, there are better 
options for making sure your 
money not only sits there but 
actually grows over time.
Accounting for your life: tips for savings

Pittsburgh’s connection to 
the environment is one that has 
been, historically, dire. At one 
point in the city’s history, the 
sky was famously filled with so 
much pollution and soot that 
it turned black. Even as late 
as 2008 and 2009, I remember 
the city cleaning black soot off 
of various buildings. Certainly, 
the city has turned around over 
the decades.
Despite this, Pittsburgh and 
the greater Allegheny County 
area continues to have the 
worst air quality in the nation. 
One in three children suffer 
from asthma, which is double 
the national average.
Through my canvassing 
experience this summer, I heard 
multiple anecdotes of people 
with breathing issues who can’t 
stay in downtown because the 
air quality is bad.
Steel companies like U.S. 
Steel, ArcelorMittal, and ATI 
Brackenridge continue to 
break federal clean air laws. 
Even the effects and benefits 
of successful lawsuits like 
PennEnvironment’s lawsuit 
against ArcelorMittal for 
breaking clean air laws are 
diluted by Pittsburgh’s and, 
more broadly, Pennsylvania’s 
connection to steel. Just earlier 
this July, a U.S. Steel plant 
caught fire in Clairton county. 
This led to a town hall meeting 
filled with criticism over U.S. 
Steel’s lack of regulation.
Pennsylvania is in a very 
interesting era in terms of 
environmental policy. On one 
end, fracking projects across the 
state have increased, including 
a recent six-year project in 
Beaver County, which is just 
an hour north of Pittsburgh. 
Allegheny County also still uses 
lead pipes in a lot of areas. On 
the other hand, Pennsylvania 
has introduced a package of bills 
restricting single-use plastics, 
and there is a bill introduced 
by a Republican representative 
to transition Pennsylvania 
over to renewable energy by 
2050. Both of these bills have 
bipartisan support and have the 
potential to be passed despite 
Republican majorities in both 
the State House and Senate.
As for why this shift has been 
coming about, it’s important 
to examine the changing 
demographics of Pennsylvania, 
specifically Pittsburgh. 
Pittsburgh is shifting away from 
its industrial roots towards 
tech, and many people in the 
city have been disillusioned 
with industry over the years. 
Traditionally conservative 
areas like Mount Lebanon, Fox 
Chapel, and Ross Township 
have all flipped purple 
recently. While canvassing 
this summer, I found that 
even more traditionally 
conservative people were very 
“environmentally friendly,” 
contrary to a popular conception 
that conservatives tend to be 
more anti-environment.
So even with quite a 
bit of public support for 
environmental issues, why is it 
so hard to get anything passed? 
The obvious answer is lobbying 
from massive corporations, 
but I’d argue there are bigger 
things that hinder us all. I 
spoke to the Democrat State 
Senate Minority Leader Jay 
Costa, and he was talking about 
all the initiatives he wanted 
to take in Pennsylvania for 
environmental action.
Yet his biggest concern 
was short-term job growth, 
which in my experience seems 
to be a bipartisan concern. 
For example, I would often 
get questions like “Wouldn’t 
banning styrofoam cause lots 
of job loss?” or “Wouldn’t 
transitioning to renewables 
create job loss in the oil 
sector?” Really, it’s this short-
term mentality that drives 
corporate lobbying and the 
culture of convenience, stifling 
any environmental progress we 
could potentially make.
We can go on about the 
economics of banning products 
with negative external effects 
on society or the logistics of 
shifting our energy supply to 
renewables (which will be good 
only in both the short- and 
long-term).
Instead, let’s focus on the 
false narrative, the idea that 
trying to do any goodwill results 
in equal loss. It’s not true. In 
the short term, if we ban things 
like styrofoam or carcinogenic 
weed killers, it will create less 
demand for those products. But 
it also creates more demand for 
better alternatives, and when 
demand for those alternatives 
goes up, so will the demand 
for labor in that sector. Right 
now, the fastest-growing 
job sector in Pennsylvania 
is in renewables, and all the 
traditional industrial sectors 
are shrinking. So why are we 
focusing so hard on outdated 
industries?
The final point I’d like to 
make is a general point about 
the fact that people are not 
rational. In both economics 
and political science, we 
like to assume that, but in 
reality, it’s mostly never that 
way. That’s why this idea 
of consumer sovereignty is 
mostly bogus and why we need 
incentives and nudges to push 
people in the right direction. 
That’s the rationale behind 
needing strong environmental 
legislation. People aren’t just 
going to switch to renewable 
energy or paper containers 
or non-gas cars because they 
know it’s rational to do that. 
We need legislation to promote 
these actions.
It’s honestly refreshing and 
reassuring that postindustrial 
cities like Pittsburgh and 
postindustrial states like 
Pennsylvania are shifting 
towards more environmentally 
friendly policies. I am hopeful 
for the future of environmental 
policy across the nation and 
in Pennsylvania, and it will be 
interesting to see what happens 
over the next couple of years.
“I would often get questions such as “wouldn’t 
banning styrofoam cause lots of job loss?” or 
“wouldn’t transitioning to renewables create job loss 
in the oil sector?” Really, it’s the mentality of thinking 
in the short-term that drives corporate lobbying 
and the culture of convenience that stifles any 
environmental progress we could potentially make.”

U.S. needs change in current 
approach to foreign policy
STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC
SOCIETY
Special to The Tartan
In the summer of 2018, 
Google employees organized to 
end their company’s contract 
with the U.S. military’s Project 
Maven, which is “intended to 
help the Pentagon use artificial 
intelligence to analyze drone 
footage” for potential targets 
and other objects of interest. 
But, as reported last week by 
WESA, Project Maven was later 
“quietly” picked up by Carnegie 
Mellon researchers and folded 
into Carnegie Mellon’s Army AI 
Task Force.
Next week, many Carnegie 
Mellon students will attend 
the Technical Opportunities 
Conference, an annual career 
fair featuring hundreds of 
companies offering lucrative 
job opportunities and stable 
futures. Hopefully, the lines to 
talk to Google reps will be longer 
than the lines for Lockheed 
Martin, General Dynamics, and 
Honeywell, three companies 
that manufacture weapons 
for the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, 
raking in billions of dollars 
thanks to deadly conflict. Unlike 
those companies, Google’s reps 
will be able to tell Carnegie 
Mellon students: “hey, if you’re 
creeped out by your university’s 
connections to the military and 
intelligence community but still 
want to build tech, come work at 
Google!”
What does it say about our 
university that we are less 
ethical than a top employer of 
Carnegie Mellon graduates? 
And what would it look like for 
Carnegie Mellon to develop the 
kind of internal democracy that 
Google employees leveraged 
to end their company’s Project 
Maven contract?
Ironically, Carnegie Mellon 
touts its Artificial Intelligence 
program’s “strong emphasis on 
ethics and social responsibility,” 
while the new dean of the 
School of Computer Science 
stresses that ethical computing is 
“already a part of the education” 
of Computer Science students. 
Given what we now know about 
Project Maven, the inclusion of 
ethical content in CS degrees 
feels like a weak PR gesture 
meant to head off criticism of the 
college’s deepening relationship 
with the military-industrial 
complex.
What's done in the name 
of Carnegie Mellon — the 
technology created here and 
touted constantly in press 
releases as evidence of Carnegie 
Mellon’s “vital importance...to 
[U.S.] economic prosperity and 
national security” (as President 
Jahanian wrote in a recent 
e-mail) — is done in all of our 
names. In fundraising calls 
to alumni, student callers are 
asked to stress the importance 
of donating to “increase the 
value of a degree from Carnegie 
Mellon.” But how is the value of a 
Carnegie Mellon degree affected 
when our university contributes 
to the death and destruction 
generated by the U.S. military?
It gives us no pleasure to 
conclude that Carnegie Mellon’s 
administration is complicit in 
U.S. wars. After all, this isn’t 
an entirely new phenomenon; 
Carnegie Mellon wasn’t 
nicknamed “Carnegie Military 
University” at the height of the 
Iraq War for nothing. That war, 
and the various other doomed 
post-9/11 adventures in the 
Middle East, directly killed 
272,000 people, indirectly 
killed hundreds of thousands 
more through infrastructure 
destruction and forced 
migration, and cost taxpayers 
at least $4 trillion dollars, 
according to a Reuters report. 
The toll taken on human lives, 
societies, and rights is disturbing 
enough, but the money wasted 
is worth reflecting upon. Just 
consider: that much money 
could wipe out the $1.5 trillion 
in current student debt more 
than twice over.
What do we want our 
university to be? What do we, 
as current students, faculty, 
and staff — as future graduates 
— stand for? Do we want to 
help and empower the poor and 
marginalized, make the world 
a better place, or continue to 
pass off critical ethical decisions 
to military agencies and 
policymakers whom we should 
not and cannot trust? These 
questions are unavoidable.
As Google employees 
argued in their successful 
petition against Project Maven: 
“We cannot outsource the 
moral responsibility of our 
technologies to third parties… 
This contract puts Google’s 
reputation at risk and stands 
in direct opposition to our core 
values. Building this technology 
to assist the US Government 
in military surveillance — and 
potentially lethal outcomes — is 
not acceptable.”
So, again we ask: is Carnegie 
Mellon less ethical than 
Google? And when will our 
administration begin to involve 
more of us in these consequential 
moral and political decisions? 
Student and faculty government, 
organizations, staff unions, and 
other campus bodies should 
come together around an 
agenda of internal democracy 
at Carnegie Mellon. None of this 
is going to change until we find 
ways to play a more active, more 
effective role in the future of our 
university.

There is a lot of rhetoric 
surrounding the unprecedented 
nature of the current regime’s 
foreign policy “strategy.” I 
put that in quotes because 
the United States hasn’t had 
a proper foreign policy since 
9/11, and arguably hasn’t had 
one since the Gulf War. But 
even in both the post-Cold War 
and post-9/11 era, there was a 
degree of predictability that the 
U.S. had followed since the end 
of World War II. Currently, the 
U.S. sits in a unique position as 
the Trump administration has 
thrown all those precedents out 
the window.
As for what those precedents 
are, it’s good to briefly 
understand U.S. foreign policy 
up until the current regime. 
During the Cold War, the goal 
was to contain communism. 
After the USSR’s dissolution, 
the goal shifted to maintain 
their hegemony in a unipolar 
world. After 9/11, the focus 
became counter-terrorism. 
Regardless of whether or not 
you agree with any of the U.S.’s 
tactics (and there is a lot to 
disagree with in each era), 
the nation has maintained a 
sense of its traditional allies 
and at least held some respect 
for regional and multilateral 
treaties and trade deals.
Under Trump, allies like 
Canada and the European 
Union have been tariffed in 
the name of national security, 
and the regime hasn’t agreed 
to adhere to many of the 
agreements it was a part of or 
had committed to. It’s difficult 
to pinpoint exactly why. 
Trying to understand Trump’s 
mentality is about as futile as 
the war on terror. But the actual 
policy is no different than what 
the U.S. has been engaging in 
for decades.
Although the U.S.’s self-
imposed responsibility as one 
of the world’s leading powers is 
to maintain peace and stability, 
there are countless examples 
throughout history that prove 
otherwise. Propping up puppet 
dictators and governments in 
Guatemala, Iran, Chile, and 
Congo, failing to act on the 
Rwandan genocide, starting 
the Iraq War, the drone strike 
program, and the collapse of 
the Syrian chemical weapon 
red line are some examples 
of the failure of the U.S. to 
promote peace and stability. If 
anything, U.S. foreign policy 
seems more like shots in the 
dark hoping for the best rather 
than strategically calculated 
moves. In short, the U.S. is 
more an agent of disorder than 
an agent of order.
Trump’s foreign policy is no 
different, though he goes about 
it in less “traditional” ways. 
His exercise of hard power 
seems to be more in line with a 
businessman trying to portray 
himself as strong and trying 
to get the other players to call 
his bluff or fold. Everything 
he does is designed to gain 
political points for his base in 
some way. The randomness of 
the Chinese trade war, forcing 
allies to “contribute their share” 
to the world, and praising or 
meeting dictators historically 
considered enemies are all 
shots in the dark to mask the 
fact that the rest of his policy 
is continuing what the U.S. has 
been doing for a long time now.
Frankly, the U.S. has lost a 
lot of goodwill over the years. 
Any international sympathy 
or political points gained after 
9/11 have been exhausted, 
and it’s time for the nation to 
re-evaluate its foreign policy 
strategy. It surely won’t happen 
under this administration, but 
whoever the next president is 
will have to deal with a world 
that is quickly changing. With 
the threat of climate change 
around the corner, the rise of 
multiple powers like China, 
India, and Russia, and an 
interconnected international 
system, the U.S. needs to 
establish its priorities.
For starters, the U.S. needs 
to scale back its hard power 
usage. While hard power is a 
cornerstone of U.S. foreign 
policy, it has been abused 
to the point where it causes 
more problems than good. 
This includes getting rid of the 
drone program, minimizing 
direct involvement in the war 
on terror, and reducing mass 
surveillance. Hard power 
should be used to intervene in 
genocides, not to cause one in 
the name of global security and 
democracy. In addition, the 
U.S. needs to take initiative on 
international climate actions.
This is an issue that should 
be uniting the world. The U.S. 
taking a hardline stance in favor 
of international climate action 
will not only be beneficial 
in the long term for obvious 
reasons but could potentially 
bring about some stability by 
having a chance to collaborate 
with China, a country that 
has already has made more 
promises to climate plans than 
the U.S. currently has. Most 
importantly, the U.S. needs 
to do a better job of accepting 
its mistakes and rebuilding its 
soft power and diplomatic ties. 
This will help in rebuilding 
goodwill, especially with 
nations in Southwest Asia and 
North Africa (I refuse to call it 
the Middle East).
Reforming decades of bad 
foreign policy is not an easy 
task, and it would be much 
easier for the U.S. to continue 
as it has for a while. The 
suggestions above are easier 
said than done, especially 
after the rhetorical damage 
the Trump regime has caused. 
The U.S. needs to get rid of the 
attitude that everything in this 
world are zero-sum and that 
every action exists in a bubble. 
If the U.S. wants to continue 
being the world leader it thinks 
it is, it should start acting like 
one.

Converting carbon dioxide into fuel
ASHWIN SRINIVASAN
SciTech Editor
Greenhouse gases are a major 
contributor to climate change. 
They have increased in concen-
tration over the last century and 
are a very common air pollutant. 
Now, they may become a useful 
source of energy.
A catalytic reactor developed 
by researchers at Rice University 
converts carbon dioxide into pure 
liquid fuels in an ef?cient and eco-
friendly manner. The prototype 
was created in the lab of chemical 
and biomolecular engineering 
researcher Haotian Wang. It 
re-purposes carbon dioxide as 
puri?ed high-concentration 
formic acid, an energy carrier 
that usually requires extensive 
conversion to be useful. However, 
this technology demonstrates an 
ef?ciency of 42 percent in tests 
and is able to store nearly half of 
the input greenhouse gas energy 
in a liquid formic acid fuel cell.
“Formic acid is an energy 
carrier,” Wang said in a press 
release. “It’s a fuel-cell fuel that 
can generate electricity and emit 
carbon dioxide — which you 
can grab and recycle again.” He 
continued, “It’s also fundamental 
in the chemical engineering 
industry as a feedstock for other 
chemicals, and a storage material 
for hydrogen that can hold nearly 
1,000 times the energy of the 
same volume of hydrogen gas, 
which is dif?cult to compress. 
That’s currently a big challenge 
for hydrogen fuel-cell cars.”
Lead author and Rice postdoc-
toral researcher Chuan Xia made 
the key discovery that allows the 
reactor to function. He developed a 
two-dimensional bismuth catalyst 
and a solid-state electrolyte that 
removes the requirement of salt in 
the reaction.
“Bismuth is a very heavy atom, 
compared to transition metals 
like copper, iron or cobalt,” Wang 
explained. “Its mobility is much 
lower, particularly under reaction 
conditions. So that stabilizes the 
catalyst.”
Usually, the production of 
formic acid introduces salty water 
which is energy-intensive and 
costly to remove. The ?exible use 
of solid electrolytes eliminates 
this concern, according to Wang. 
The process used to produce these 
components can be scaled up, 
opening the door to commercial 
carbon dioxide conversion 
technologies.
In addition, the reactor runs 
water through the product 
chamber faster than previously 
possible, resulting in more 
concentrated, and therefore 
more ef?cient, formic acid. Next-
generation reactors are expected 
to achieve even higher concen-
tration as they accept gas ?ow to 
bring out pure formic acid vapors.
To test their prototype, the 
Rice scientists worked with 
the Brookhaven National 
Laboratory using X-ray absorption 
spectroscopy to view formic 
acid production in progress. The 
reactor ran continuously for 100 
hours with negligible degrada-
tion. Wang also thinks it could be 
customized to produce fuels other 
than formic acid, like acetic acid, 
ethanol, or propanol fuels.
“The big picture is that 
carbon dioxide reduction is 
very important for its effect on 
global warming as well as for 
green chemical synthesis,” Wang 
concluded. “If the electricity 
comes from renewable sources 
like the sun or wind, we can create 
a loop that turns carbon dioxide 
into something important without 
emitting more of it.”
“Carbon dioxide reduction is very important for 
its effect on global warming as well as for green 
chemical synthesis.”

Predicting how climate change makes landslides more severe
TRENTO VON LINDENBERG
Staffwriter
While talking about the 
weather has always been a staple 
of idle chit-chat, if you’ve been 
keeping up with the conversation 
over the last few years — or 
even just the last few months 
— you might have noticed that 
it’s been a bit… wonky. Will it 
rain today, or snow tomorrow?
But it doesn’t end there. Over 
this past summer alone, extreme 
heat waves across Europe 
have led to countless deaths as 
new record highs were set. To 
add to the death toll, the high 
frequency of natural disasters 
over the past year (including 
?res in California and the 
Amazon rainforest) is also often 
attributed to climate change. 
Earlier this year, researchers 
from the United Nations stated 
that climate change would reach 
an irreversible point by 2030, 
although action needs to be taken 
much sooner to prevent that.
It has long been known 
that climate change impacts 
temperatures, natural disasters, 
and wildlife among others. 
Now we can add yet another:

Measuring heart cells in three dimensions
SEAN MIN
Staffwriter
Researchers from Carnegie 
Mellon University and Nanyang 
Technological University in 
Singapore (NTU Singapore) have 
collaborated on a revolutionary 
“organ-on-an-electronic-chip 
platform.”
An organ-on-an-electronic-
chip is a synthetic cell culture 
chip into which living human 
cells are placed to simulate 
how an organ acts in response 
to numerous situations. In 
this project, researchers from 
Carnegie Mellon and NTU 
Singapore created an organ-
on-an-electronic-chip platform 
which contains bioelectrical 
sensors measuring the cardiac 
electrophysiology of heart cells 
in three dimensions.
Cardiac electrophysiology 
concerns the electrical activity 
of the cardiac system. The new 
biosensor arrays created by 
these researchers surround heart 
cell spheroid tissues, permit-
ting researchers to observe the 
intercommunication of cells in 
the cardiac system and similar 
multicellular systems.
This organ-on-an-electronic-
chip platform has a multitude of 
uses, including testing the effec-
tiveness of drugs on human-like 
tissue rather than animal tissue 
(which is the current practice). 
Scientists will be able to more 
accurately predict the impact 
of drugs and toxins on human 
tissue. Another application is 
to study the interconnectivity 
between the heart’s electrical 
signals and various heart 
diseases. Finally, the platform 
enables future research in areas 
such as tissue development and 
cell maturation.

ate professor of materials science

Modeling damage to infrastructure
LANDSLIDES, from A7
research into how climate change 
has affected the jetstream. The 
Guardian picked up this story in 
Aug.
Jetstreams are narrow bands 
of moving air that encircle the 
globe several miles above sea 
level, reaching speeds of up to 
250 mph. The turbulence you 
may experience on transatlantic 
?ights is frequently due to these 
jetstreams, and they are only 
getting worse.
According to Paul Williams, 
one of the researchers behind 
the study, in The Guardian “the 
winds and temperatures are in 
a certain kind of balance in the 
atmosphere… it is impossible to 
change the temperature patterns 
without… [affecting] the 
wind patterns.” This argument 
was backed up by their data, 
which showed that there has 
been a signi?cant change 
in the jetstream since 1979, 
consistent with climate change 
patterns. “The amount of severe 
turbulence… could double or 
triple by the period 2050-2080,” 
according to The Guardian.
But even if you don’t ?y, 
climate change is still affecting 
us right here in Pittsburgh. Not 
only are we experiencing wonky 
weather, but now we’re also 
getting landslides.
The United States Geological 
Survey has estimated that the 
yearly death toll due to land-
slides is between 25 and 50 
deaths, combined with two to 
four billion dollars worth of prop-
erty damage. And in Pittsburgh, 
landslides have been on the rise, 
with over 131 properties dam-
aged in 2018 alone, a trend that 
is expected to continue over the 
years. Worldwide, the death toll 
is in the thousands.
The natural question is: 
what does climate change have 
to do with this? The answer is 
surprisingly simple. “The issue 
is that many areas are becoming 
wetter,” said Karen Lightman, 
the executive director of the 
Metro21: Smart Cities Institute 
in a Carnegie Mellon press 
release. But even with such a 
simple explanation, predicting 
when and where landslides may 
occur is no easy task.
Enter Cristoph Mertz, the 
principal project scientist at 
the Carnegie Mellon University 
Robotics Institute and co-founder 
of RoadBotics, who is researching 
how deep learning, a subset of 
machine learning, can be used 
to detect an impending landslide 
before it occurs.
The potential for Mertz’s net-
work extends beyond detection 
as he hopes to use it to direct a 
potential infrastructure change 
that would be better prepared 
to predict and prevent land-
slides. By developing a consistent 
metric of damage from land-
slides, Mertz’s model can guide 
budget decisions and resource 
allocations to areas that need it 
most, bolstering the American 
infrastructure as a whole.
Currently, Mertz’s team is 
working with specialists both 
inside and outside of Carnegie 
Mellon, including authorities on 
computer science, geology, infra-
structure, and water and sewage, 
and collaborating with Allegheny 
County to test the viability of the 
network on potential landslide 
locations.
From student organizations 
to department “Green Teams,” 
there is a lot the student body is 
doing to mitigate the impact of 
global climate change.

reports in an engineering press 
release, “For decades, electro-
physiology was done using cells 
and cultures on two-dimensional 
surfaces, such as culture dishes. 
We are trying to circumvent the 
challenge of reading the heart’s 
electrical patterns in 3D by 
developing a way to shrink-wrap 
sensors around heart cells and 
extracting electrophysiological 
information from this tissue.”
Researchers like Cohen-Karni 
set up organ-on-an-electronic-
chip platforms by ?rst attaching 
a set of sensors to the chip’s 
surface. These sensors are 
typically composed of graphene 
sensors or metallic electrodes. 
The germanium composing 
the bottom layer of this set of 
sensors is removed, after which 
the set of sensors is free to move 
independently, and rolls around 
the surface of the chip.
Cardiac spheroids, long organ-
oids containing heart cells and 
as wide as two or three human 
hairs, were the test surface upon 
which the researchers deployed 
their platform. The platform coils 
on its own over the spheroid, 
allowing the collection of precise 
and accurate electrical signal 
readings from the spheroids.
“Essentially, we have created 
3D self-rolling biosensor arrays for 
exploring the electrophysiology 
of induced pluripotent stem 
cell-derived cardiomyocytes,” 
said Ph.D. student in biomedical 
engineering and 
lead author Anna 
Kalmykov. “This 
platform could 
be used to 
do research 
into cardiac 
tissue re-
generation 
and matura-
tion that poten-
tially can be used 
to treat damaged 
tissue after a heart 
attack, for example, 
or developing new 
drugs to treat disease.”
“...many areas are becoming wetter.”

by a touchdown. The ?nal play 
was a ?ve-yard run by junior 
running back Luke Bikulege. 
Immediately following the 
?rst drive of the third quarter, 
senior safety Parker Mellott 
intercepted a pass by the 
MIT quarterback, returning 
it to the opponent’s 23-yard 
line. But the Tartans couldn’t 
convert a ?rst down, and 
the drive ended in a Tartan 
?eld goal, with sophomore 
Brandon Nguyen scoring from 
33 yards.
After the Tartan kickoff 
and Engineer return, the 
very ?rst play of the drive 
saw a bad snap sent back 
into the Engineer endzone. 
Senior defensive end Michael 
Lohmeier picked it up for a 
Tartan touchdown making 
the score 24–7 where it stayed 
for the rest of the game. The 
24 unanswered points left the 
Tartans with a commanding 
lead at the end of a strong 
third quarter. There were no 
points scored in the fourth 
quarter, as the Tartans moved 
to run out the clock.
Dayhuff completed 9 of 18 
attempted passes for a total of 
148 yards with one touchdown 
and one interception. Dayhuff 
also attempted ?ve rushes for 
37 yards. Leading the team in 
rushing yards, however, was 
Bikulege with 56 yards on 15 
attempts. Nguyen, beyond hitting 
the ?eld goal, went three for three 
on his extra points.
The totals for each team looked 
similar, with Carnegie Mellon 
having two fewer ?rst downs 
and a less ef?cient third-down 
conversion percentage; however, 
Carnegie Mellon has fewer 
penalties and penalty yards. The 
Engineers also turned the ball 
over three times on two fumbles 
and an interception to the Tartans 
single turnover, an interception.
Carnegie Mellon and MIT both 
rushed for 127 yards. Carnegie 
Mellon passed for 148 yards; 
MIT, for 162. The Tartan defense 
was led by senior defensive end 
Long Tran with seven tackles and 
a sack. Richter led the receiving 
yards for the Tartans with 106.
The next football game for 
the Tartans is Saturday, Sept. 
14 against Geneva College in 
Beaver Falls, PA. The game is set 
to begin at 7 p.m. Geneva College  
currently has one win this season.

Tragedy struck the motorsport 
community on Aug. 31 when 
French Formula 2 driver Anthoine 
Hubert passed away due to 
injuries from a high-speed crash 
at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps 
in Belgium. Hubert, who was just 
22 years old, was participating in 
the feature race for Formula 2, 
the top feeder series for Formula 
1 where young drivers hone their 
skills before stepping up to the 
pinnacle of motorsports.
The crash occurred on the 
second lap of the race in the 
notoriously tricky Eau Rouge-
Raidillon complex of corners, 
featuring a downhill dip before 
a steep incline which the drivers 
take ?at out. The crash was 
triggered by Giuliano Alesi losing 
control of his car through Eau 
Rouge, glancing off the tire wall, 
and ricocheting back onto the 
track at the top of the hill.
Seeing this, the following 
driver, Ralph Boschung, slowed 
and steered to the right of Alesi’s 
damaged car. Hubert, who was 
close behind Boschung, couldn’t 
see the events unfolding ahead of 
him until he crested the hill, and 
made an emergency move to the 
right to try to avoid Boschung’s 
slow race car. However, Hubert 
clipped the back of Boschung, 
sending him into the tire barrier. 
Hubert’s car bounced off and 
ended up stranded in the run-off 
area, perpendicular to the track.
Unfortunately, Juan Manuel 
Correa, who was behind Hubert, 
also went to the right of Boschung 
and Alesi, only to ?nd his path 
blocked by Hubert’s car. Correa 
had no time to react, crashing into 
the side of Hubert’s helpless car 
at around 160 mph, a terrifying 
scene that immediately stopped 
the race. Hubert was pronounced 
dead at the track, while Correa 
was sent to the hospital with 
two broken legs and spinal cord 
damage. He was placed in an 
induced coma on Sept. 7 after 
being diagnosed with acute 
respiratory distress syndrome.
Fatal accidents in Formula 1 
and other series have prompted 
extensive discussion about safety 
improvements, often resulting in 
rule changes to prevent similar 
accidents from happening again. 
After Jules Bianchi died in 2015 
from head injuries sustained 
in a 2014 crash, Formula 1 and 
its feeder series introduced the 
“halo,” an additional safety 
structure around the drivers’ 
head to prevent head injuries.
Unfortunately, there is no 
obvious path towards preventing 
incidents similar to the one that 
killed Hubert. Open-wheeled 
race cars like Hubert’s Formula 
2 car are designed to protect the 
driver by dissipating forces when 
the vehicle hits stationary objects 
such as tire walls, and serious 
injuries are now relatively rare. 
However, in Hubert’s case, his 
car was the stationary object, 
and the safety structures in the 
car’s chassis are not designed 
to dissipate the forces in that 
scenario since the chances of it 
happening are extremely low.
While the crash was partly 
a result of the fast nature of the 
Eau Rouge-Raidillon complex 
and the blind spot created by 
the uphill section, the geography 
of the area surrounding Spa-
Francorchamps make it near-
ly impossible to redesign the 
corner. The circumstances that 
led to Hubert’s death mean that 
there isn’t a clear way to prevent 
a similar tragedy in the future, 
although an investigation is being 
conducted.
The crash left the motorsport 
community in shock. The 
feature race was abandoned 
and the second Formula 2 race 
was cancelled. While the main 
event, Formula 1’s Belgian Grand 
Prix, still ran the following day, 
Hubert’s untimely passing was 
ever present in the minds of the 
drivers, team members, and fans. 
Two moments of silence were held 
before the race, with everyone 
involved in Formula 1 and its 
feeder series standing on track in 
solidarity with Hubert’s mother 
and brother. Every Formula 1 car 
sported a sticker reading “Racing 
for Anthoine,” and on lap 19 of 
the Grand Prix, every fan stood 
and applauded for the whole lap 
to honor Hubert, who had raced 
wearing number 19. Race winner 
Charles Leclerc dedicated his 
victory to his late friend, keeping 
his celebrations subdued and 
pointing skywards as he emerged 
from the cockpit.
Hubert was a talented racer: 
he earned his spot in Formula 2 by 
winning the GP3 Series in 2018, 
and was signed to Renault’s driver 
academy, giving him a clear route 
to an eventual seat in Formula 
1. He was also one of the most 
well-liked faces in the Formula 2 
paddock, and had remained close 
friends with many of the drivers 
who had graduated to Formula 1 
before him. His presence on and 
off-track will be sorely missed. 
Rest in peace, Anthoine Hubert.

Penalty Shouts: Randy Dobnak, baseball’s Uber Driver of the year
Antonio Brown’s wacky, wet, and wild summer antics
MARIKA YANG
Publisher
Forget Hot Girl Summer, let’s 
talk about Antonio Brown’s Hot 
Mess Summer, which in its chaos 
may have just led him exactly 
where he wanted. After nine years 
with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the 
relationship turned sour and 
he had a rebound summer ?ing 
with the Oakland Raiders before 
promptly moving on to the one 
and only New England Patriots.
But let’s backtrack. More 
happened relating to Brown this 
summer than what could ?t in a 
season of reality television. The 
2018 season was the breaking 
point for Brown and the Steelers, 
with his relationship with star 
quarterback Ben Roethlisberger 
deteriorating beyond repair. He 
was benched the ?nal game of the 
season and ?nally traded (per his 
request) in March. He then signed 
a new 3-year, $50 million contract 
with $30 million guaranteed 
with the Raiders, which was an 
important point for Brown. For 
several months in the offseason 
it seemed that the drama from 
Pittsburgh was over, and Brown, 
even with his “diva” tendencies 
(dyeing his facial hair blonde, 
competing on The Masked Singer), 
was starting fresh on a new team 
on the other side of the country. 
How wrong we were.
It started in Aug., with 
one of the weirdest “injuries” 
anyone has seen in sports. In a 
cryotherapy session, Brown wore 
improper footwear that caused 
frostbite to his feet, causing him 
to miss several Raiders practices 
in training camp. But probably 
the most random thing was what 
came next: the tale of Brown and 
his helmet. With the growing 
awareness of head injuries to 
players, the NFL required all 
players to wear a new model of 
helmet which was tested to be 
safer. But like many athletes, 
Brown is a creature of habit and 
demanded that he could continue 
to wear his old one. After two 
failed grievances and a threat 
of retirement, he ?nally put the 
issue to bed on Sept. 4 when he 
announced on Instagram that 
he would be wearing the Xenith 
Shadow helmet, likely part of an 
endorsement deal.
But that date, Sept. 4, was 
when it all started spiraling out 
of control. Due to his missed 
practices and absences from the 
team, Raiders general manager 
Mike Mayock ?ned Brown 
$54,000. Indignant, Brown 
posted the letter from Mayock on 
Instagram (which has since been 
deleted), leading to an altercation 
between the two men the next 
day. While we can’t know exactly 
what happened, different sources 
provided information alleging 
Brown called Mayock “cracker,” 
had to be held back by teammate 
Vontaze Bur?ct, and punted a 
ball.
The next day, Sept. 6, saw 
another heel turn. Brown 
apologized to the team, and 
Raiders head coach Jon Gruden 
told the media that Brown was 
expected to play in the team’s ?rst 
game on Monday night. It seemed 
that his teammates had embraced 
him and were ready to move on 
from the drama and ?nally play 
football, but less than a day later, 
Brown rerouted his path. On Sept. 
7, the Raiders voided Brown’s 
$30 million guaranteed money, a 
?gure that Brown valued highly. 
And so, as he is wont to do, he 
went to Instagram and asked the 
Raiders to release him.
They did. Immediately, 
the internet caught ?re. Many 
criticized him for losing the 
money he had wanted so badly, all 
for a $54,000 ?ne. Others cheered 
good riddance, while some 
mocked the Raiders for not even 
getting Brown for a real game. 
Nearly every trend on Twitter was 
about Brown and the Raiders. 
The others? Bill Belichick and the 
Patriots. Because everyone knew 
that Belichick could swoop in 
with his ingenious roster moves 
and pick up, arguably, the best 
wide receiver in the league. And 
that’s what he did.
Mere hours after the Raiders 
released him, Brown signed 
with the Patriots on a 1-year, 
$15 million deal, including 
at $9 million signing bonus. 
Gruden looked foolish, Belichick 
shrewd as usual, and Brown, 
well, he looked like he could’ve 
masterminded this whole thing. 
There are probably too many 
variables for him to have hatched 
this whole plan before he was 
traded from the Steelers, but 
some of his recent antics make 
more sense. The missed practices, 
the altercations, the bizarre mood 
swings — could they all have been 
to get the Raiders to release him?
The Patriots would have never 
traded with the Steelers. They 
are known for their economical 
roster-building, and ability to 
snatch up underappreciated (see, 
James White) or controversial 
players (see, Randy Moss) and 
turn them into huge producers 
on the ?eld. But with Brown 
released, they could sign him to a 
reasonable 1-year deal and have 
the stability and power to cut him 
if he causes any trouble. Adding 
Brown to their receiving corps 
makes their offense dangerous, 
especially after star tight end Rob 
Gronkowski’s retirement. Because 
they are the Patriots, the biggest 
dynasty in NFL history, led with 
a strong hand by Belichick. They 
can afford to add a potential risk 
to their locker room.
One thing is clear from Brown’s 
subsequent social media posts: 
he’s happy to be in New England 
and ecstatic to be out of Oakland 
just one day after saying he was 
“excited to be part of the Raiders.” 
If only he could have played in the 
Patriots’ week 1 against his old 
?ame, the Steelers, but he will 
not be active until week 2. That 
would’ve been too scripted, and 
for once, this crazy drama was all 
reality.

This is Penalty Shouts, The 
Tartan’s sports column inspired 
by the The New Yorker’s column 
Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled 
column will focus on anything 
and everything funny in the sports 
world that is deserving of our 
comedic attention. 
Last week, South Park native 
and owner of a sick horseshoe 
mustachio Randy Dobnak made 
his major league debut for the 
Minnesota Twins. Just two years 
ago, Dobnak was an unscouted, 
unmustachioed Independent 
League baseball player based out 
of the famous baseball-ing state 
of Michigan. As any baseball fan 
would know, when Ray Liotta 
asks Kevin Costner at the end of 
Field of Dreams if this is heaven, 
Costner responds: “No, it’s 
Michigan.”
So we have to ask our-
selves, where did Dobnak come 
from? And more importantly, 
how did he get that sick face 
spaghetti? If Dobnak played 
basketball, I would say a group 
of aliens descended from the 
Warner Brothers Universe to 
grant Dobnak his abilities (and 
mustache) by stealing powers 
from an entire team, likely the 
Pirates. It would explain why 
Dobnak has only just made his 
major league debut because 
powers stolen from a team with 
success would put Dobnak on a 
Hall of Fame track. Alas, we don’t 
live in a Looney Tunes world. 
We’ll have to settle for theories 
like Dobnak falling into a vat of 
radioactive waste or being bitten 
by a poisonous spider.
However, there is one theory 
just too insane to believe. 
Dobnak’s abilities were granted 
to him by the Uber genie. The 
Uber genie, of course, being 
the corporate genie that grants 
you three wishes (terms and 
conditions apply) if you have 
a perfect 5/5 rating on Uber. 
Given to us by a collective of 
the most powerful tech geniuses 
around — Zuckerberg, Gates, 
Andrew Yang — any Uber driver, 
like Dobnak, may accept the 
chance for three wishes in lieu 
of any compensation from the 
company for the work provided. 
In previous corporate genie 
situations, the genie would have 
accepted extraneous bene?ts 
like dental or health insurance 
as recompense for the chance at 
three wishes, but Uber drivers 
don’t earn bene?ts already.
Now the question becomes 
how did Dobnak, professional 
baseball player, have time to 
drive for Uber? Additionally, 
why did he drive for Uber? Isn’t 
baseball a pro?table enterprise? 
And how did he end up with a 
4.99/5 rating on Uber? Note: 
Uber genie uses a truncation 
system with a 0.01 margin of er-
ror.
Turns out, the starting salary 
of a minor league baseball player 
is $12,000 per season. $12,000 
may be a livable amount for four 
months of the year, especially 
when those four months are 
spent with most of your travel 
and living expenses paid. But 
what are these aspiring major 
leaguers supposed to do for the 
other eight months of the year, 
when their wealthier teammates 
are taking batting practice in 
Venezuela? Usually, they turn to 
the gig economy. After all, it’s 
hard to get a decent job when 
you tell your boss that you have 
to disappear for four, ?ve, even 
six months of the year. Dobnak 
turned to Uber to help pay the 
bills at a ?nancially tough time, 
and Dobnak continued to drive 
for Uber even into spring training 
this past year. That was when 
the Uber genie must have found 
our struggling Dobnak, took pity 
on him, and offered him three 
wishes.
First, Dobnak wished for 
in?nite wishes. The genie didn’t 
grant the wish saying, “genies 
never grant that wish silly.” 
Second, Dobnak wished for all 
the money in the world, but the 
genie denied it on the basis that 
he would have to take Uber’s 
money, too, which isn’t allowed. 
Finally, Dobnak wished to be good 
at baseball. The genie granted 
the wish with the condition that 
Dobnak spend eternity playing 
baseball in the frozen ninth circle 
of Hell: Minnesota.

Over the past two weeks, the 
fall season for Tartan sports has 
kicked into gear. Cross country, 
soccer, and women’s volleyball 
have all had matches in the two 
weeks since the start of the new 
semester.
The men’s cross country team 
placed second at the Duquesne 
Duals meet in Schenley Park on 
the ?rst weekend of the month, 
placing above the University 
of Pittsburgh and Youngstown 
State University, both Division 
I programs. This past weekend, 
the Tartans placed ?rst out of ten 
local colleges, with our runners 
taking second, ?fth, and seventh 
through eleventh place.
The women’s cross country 
team placed third out of six teams 
at the Duquesne Duals, beating 
Robert Morris University and 
Youngstown State. At the meet 
this past weekend, the women’s 
cross country team also placed in 
?rst, but they just barely edged 
out second-place ?nishers Case 
Western. There were only two 
points of difference between 
Carnegie Mellon and Case 
Western, with points adding 
up depending on what place a 
runner ?nishes. If one Carnegie 
Mellon runner switched places 
with a Case Western runner, the 
meet would have ended as a tie.
In men’s soccer, the team 
won their ?rst matchup against 
Salisbury University by a score 
of 2-1, and on the following day, 
the team lost 3-2 to St. Mary’s 
University. This weekend was the 
beginning of a home stand for 
the team, with a game on Friday 
against Mount Union that the 
team lost 1-0. They had a game 
on 3 p.m. on Sunday, but the 
game had not ?nished by time of 
publication.
Women’s soccer won their 
?rst game against Aurora Uni-
versity by a score of 5-0. The 
following day they lost 1-0 to 
Northern Ohio University. This 
weekend they played Denison 
University and Kenyon College. 
On Saturday, they tied Denison 
2-2 after two overtime periods, 
and the game against Kenyon 
began at 1 p.m. with the game-
ending too late for publication.
The women’s volleyball 
team is undefeated to start the 
season. They have a 7-0 record 
in matches this season, only 
dropping three total sets across 
their seven games. To start the 
season, the team went to Case 
Western to play in a tournament, 
where they went 3-0. In their ?rst 
single game, they played against 
St. Vincent University at home. 
But their most impressive wins 
have been this past weekend 
at Juniata College against 15th 
ranked Ithaca College and third-
ranked Juniata. Next weekend, 
the team has a tournament 
at home, the DoubleTree 
Invitational, where they will play 
four games between Friday and 
Saturday.
On this past Saturday, the 
Carnegie Mellon football team 
traveled to Cambridge, MA to 
play the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT) in their ?rst 
regular-season matchup. The 
?nal score of the game was 24–7 
for the Tartans.
After a slow ?rst quarter, 
where the MIT Engineers went 
up by seven with just two minutes 
left on a 72-yard touchdown 
pass, the Tartans responded in 
kind with a 78-yard touchdown 
pass right before halftime. On 
the very ?rst play of the drive, 
junior quarterback JD Dayhuff 
threw the touchdown pass to 
senior wide receiver Willie 
Richter along the MIT sideline, 
where Richter drove through the 
last of the secondary to tie the 
game heading into halftime.
Taking the kickoff in the 
second half, the Tartans ran off 
a 12-play, 65-yard drive to go up

I saw some films this summer. Let’s talk about them. 
3
At least we got two good Spider-Man movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe 
(MCU) before the Sony-Disney deal fell through. Far From Home is another 
delightful addition to the MCU with the same great cast, another good villain, and 
a good extension of the events of Avengers: Endgame. What’s interesting about 
this movie is that I enjoyed it for the exact opposite reason I enjoyed Spider-Man: 
Homecoming. While I enjoyed the high school teen drama aspect of Homecoming 
the most and found the Spider-Man aspects of it to be less engaging, I actually 
liked all the Spider-Man material in this much more than the high school teen 
drama aspect. I wasn’t a big fan of the chemistry between Peter Parker and MJ 
in this one. The chemistry was there, but the dialogue just didn’t gel with me. The 
real star of this movie is Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio. He has been one of my 
favorite villains from the comics, and the movie did a great job to create a com-
pelling villain who also had all the coolest scenes in the movie. There were also 
very shocking revelations, especially in the post-credit scenes, that solidify this as 
one of the more shocking entries in the MCU. It will be interesting to see where 
the movies go next following the information revealed in this one. Overall, this 
movie was pretty good, and I personally liked it a little more than Homecoming. If 
these are the only two MCU Spider-Man movies, I think the majority of us will be 
satisfied with what we got. I’ll give this a 7/10.
Spider-Man: Far From HomeOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood
Dora and the Lost City of GoldMidsommar (Unrated Director’s Cut)
Tarantino is an interesting director for me. He is a horrible human being, but he is 
a generally good writer and director. I would always add Pulp Fiction or Reservoir 
Dogs to any film essentials list, but it would always be towards the bottom of the list 
rather than the top. He has a formula, and after Django Unchained and The Hateful 
Eight, the formula has become stale for me personally. That’s what makes his newest 
film such a refreshing change of pace. For the most part, it’s not standard Tarantino. 
The beginning 10 minutes and the last 20 minutes are more of the Tarantino you’d 
expect, but it’s balanced out by the middle portion between those two sections 
that seems to revel in its 60s setting and its cast of well thought out characters. 
Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie are all amazing in their roles, 
and Tarantino’s direction is good as usual. I’d say my complaint with this film is that 
nothing really happens until the end. It’s very weird because there seems to be a 
lot of dialogue scenes that just go nowhere, but it feels like they have a purpose 
that’s hard to pinpoint. Perhaps on my second watch I’ll understand it more, but as 
of now, that’s what it seems like to me. Overall, I enjoyed myself watching this film, 
and if you’re a Tarantino fan or if you like good dialogue, you can watch this too. I 
am also giving this a 7/10.
What on earth did I watch? I really am genuinely confused. I hated every 
second of this movie, but I also loved every second of this movie. I walked 
out of the theater and had a mental breakdown because I was so distraught 
over what I saw. I laughed so hard throughout the whole thing, and even 
during the sequences that weren’t supposed to be funny. A little girl next to 
me asked her mother, “Why is he laughing so hard?”, which only made my 
laughter worse. It’s a Nickelodeon TV movie made for the big screen, with 
an attempt to have Deadpool levels of meta-commentary. Dora is basically 
a schizophrenic psychopath in this movie, but you absolutely adore her. 
Meanwhile, everyone else is just really, really, really annoying, especially 
Dora’s parents. The plot makes absolutely no sense. There is a drug trip 
sequence in this movie for some reason. There are references to the horrors 
of colonization that no kid or even most adults would know about, including a 
reference to U.S. fruit companies creating banana republics. They hire actual 
Inca descendants who speak Quechua. There are CGI abominations of both 
Boots and Swiper who both talk and are voiced by Danny Trejo and Benecio 
Del Toro, respectively. It’s so clear the writers didn’t care about this movie 
and the studio mandate, so they knowingly created something terrible and the 
studio profited. The industry is dead everyone. This is the end as we know it. 
Let’s all be prepared for the Dora Cinematic Universe. It has been a month 
since I’ve seen this, but I’m still distraught just thinking about this movie. I am 
purposefully not revealing much about this because honestly, everyone should 
see it. I’m giving this a 2/10, but honestly, it was a 10/10 experience, which 
is why I’m conflicted as to what score to give it.
In the realm of “what did I just watch?”, we have Ari Aster’s new film, 
Midsommar, which is the most disturbing film I’ve seen since Hereditary, Aster’s 
film from last year. This is also one of the best films of the year, and it’s an 
extremely weird, terrifying, gut-wrenching, darkly funny, and oddly inspiring 
experience. I hadn’t seen the theatrical cut, so I got to watch the unadulterated 
vision Aster had for this masterpiece. Frankly, there isn’t a single scene that can 
be cut for this. Everything is necessary to build the character arcs and relation-
ships, as well as creating this eerie and strange world that the director brings 
these characters into. The sun soaked vistas of Sweden offset the disgusting rituals 
and the ugliness the characters exhibit towards each other as the film goes on. 
It’s an incredible story about overcoming grief and finding healing from those 
who genuinely care about you. The dissolution of the main characters’ relation-
ship is so beautifully and painfully realized that it’s odd the theatrical version cut 
out important scenes that depict that. As the film progressed, I only felt more and 
more perturbed by what I saw, and I slowly sat on the edge of my seat in awe. 
I wasn’t scared like I was by Hereditary, a film that almost made me vomit from 
how stressed it made me. Instead, I was just deeply unsettled to my core, feeling a 
weird mix of emotions by the end, and having it all just rattle around in my head 
for a few days. I’m sure the theatrical version of this film is very good, but the 
only real way to watch this is with the director’s cut of the film. This isn’t for the 
faint of heart, but if you like strange art films or disturbing psychological experi-
ences, watch this film as soon as possible. I’m giving this one (an actual) 10/10.

After a four-year hiatus, singer-songwriter 
Melanie Martinez has released her 
sophomore album K-12. With this release, 
Martinez managed to not only craft a 
concept album but also direct and star in 
a full-length film of the same name. The 
film ties the album together and creates 
a portrait of a girl’s development through 
school. Cry Baby, Martinez’s character, 
navigates her way through school with 
her best friend, Angelita (Elita Harkov), 
and Angelic Spirit Guide, Lilith (Kimesha 
Campbell). Together, they overthrow the 
oppressive school principal’s regime.
The album had been complete since 2017, 
but Martinez held off giving any peeks into 
her film or even a single from her album 
until this past summer. Retrospectively, it 
makes sense that she wanted to keep the 
album intact, so that they each contribute 
to the storyline, but there’s no denying 
that her fans were anxiously wishing for at 
least a glimpse of her work.

Unfortunately, Martinez had more on her 
mind these past four years than directing 
this film and producing her album. In 
2017, singer-songwriter and former friend 
Timothy Heller tweeted that Martinez 
raped her in Martinez’s home. Despite the 
allegations, Martinez continued working 
on her album and film, releasing both 
on Sept. 5, 2019. The film incorporates 
themes such as racism, elitism, and 
negative societal pressures. Her previous 
album, Cry Baby, incorporated these 
topics in more subtle ways such as 
through casting choices. However, K-12 
takes social commentary to a higher level. 
She manages to weave these topics in a 
way that does not feel forced or otherwise 
cheaply included for the sake of appearing 
socially aware.
In one scene in the first 15 minutes of 
the film, Henry, a black student, remains 
seated during the Pledge of Allegiance 
despite the teacher demanding that 
Melanie Martinez
he “show some respect.” “You hear 
that? ‘Liberty and justice for all?’ That’s 
bullshit,” he responds before school 
security forcibly removes him from the 
classroom.
Some of the racial elements were more 
subtle but appreciated nonetheless. As 
an Asian-American fan, the first thing I 
noticed was its portrayal of Asians in a 
classroom. It felt strange to realize that 
Asian schoolchildren were portrayed 
as just that: schoolchildren, not as 
some secluded whiz kids. Poking fun at 
stereotypes and those who take them 
seriously can be fun (I’m guilty of laughing 
at Asian nerds in films), but Martinez’s 
decision did not go unnoticed.
LGBT+ discrimination also pops up again 
in K-12. Like racism, LGBT+ themes were 
also previously incorporated through 
casting but not overtly in Martinez’s work. 
The film features a teacher transitioning 
comeback

---------------------------------------------------

and asking to be referred to as “Ms. 
Harper.” Despite her passion for her job 
and her connection with her 
students, the principal says he 
cannot “permit [her] to influence 
the children with this ridiculous 
behavior” and proceeds to fire 
her with a “Mr. Harper, you’re 
fired”: a scenario many of us 
have heard about far too often. 
Martinez also welcomes the 
LGBT+ community in her casting, 
as seen in her casting Zion 
Moreno, a transgender model, 
as Fleur, a girl in the popular “it” 
group.
Martinez touches on sexism 
and rape culture yet again. In 
the seventh track, “Strawberry 
Shortcake,” she jabs at how 
women are expected to “make 
sure [they’re] pure” whereas 
“nobody told [boys] not to 
grab.” The song is somewhat 
reminiscent of “Tag, You’re It,” 
a track from her first album. 
In its respective music video, a 
menacing wolf driving a white 
van follows Martinez around 
and kidnaps her. For “Strawberry 
Shortcake,” Martinez is posed in 
a large Barbie dress cake where 
the boys stuff their faces with 
cake.
Unrealistic social pressures 
also make a comeback for 
K-12. Martinez’s debut single, 
“Dollhouse,” demonstrates the 
gilded glamor the media presents 
celebrities and influencers. “Mr. 
Potato Head,” another track that 
was released in Martinez’s first 
album, critiques plastic surgery 
and the expectation for women 
to conform to a narrow perception of 
beauty. In the film, Fleur conforms to how 
she believes she should 
appear and behave 
by closely emulating 
the queen bee, Kelly, 
and develops bulimia 
nervosa. “Orange Juice” 
then shows Martinez’s 
perspective. She and Fleur 
exchange eyeballs so 
that Martinez can “give 
[Fleur her] set of eyes,” 
paralleling the impact of 
body dysmorphia.
Although waiting four 
years for more music was 
absolute agony, Martinez 
did not disappoint. K-12 
is a continuation of Cry 
Baby both conceptually 
and musically, yet it does 
not feel like a recycled 
version of the preceding 
album. The ending of the 
film for K-12 left on a bit 
of a cliffhanger, hinting 
at a potential addition 
to the story. Perhaps 
Martinez’s fellow Cry 
Babies will have to wait 
another four years, but I 
feel safe in saying many 
of us are willing to wait 
even longer if it means 
another segment equally 
emotionally evocative.

The screams roll through the arena, 
growing louder and louder until they 
seem to hit an even higher decibel 
when the stage lights blare, and the 
first beats of “Rollercoaster” fill the 
room. The Jonas Brothers are back, 
and they’re putting on a show.
On their comeback tour in support of 
their hit album, Happiness Begins, the 
Jonas Brothers stopped at PPG Paints 
Arena on Tuesday, Sept. 3. In the six 
years since they officially disbanded, 
they’ve grown up, had some solo 
career success, and got married. You 
could say the same for many of their 
fans: we grew up. The crowd ranges 
from older teenagers to young moms in 
their early thirties, with older parents, 
young kids, and the occasional 
boyfriends and husbands sprinkled 
around the packed show.
And the Jonas Brothers can really 
put on a show. Since they returned, 
they have been clear that they are 
embracing their past. In concert, 
they seamlessly alternate between 
songs from the new album and old 
hits from their young teen days. After 
a great kickoff performance with 
“Rollercoaster,” the nostalgia-filled 
track from the new album, all I can 
hear are cheers as they begin “S.O.S.”
Moving from “Strangers” to another 
oldie, “Fly With Me,” and back to 
a Happiness Begins track, “Used to 
article and layout by Marika Yang | Publisher
Be,” the crowd knows them all. The 
brothers — Kevin, Joe, and Nick — 
aren’t dancers, but they move easily 
after growing up on stage, this time 
in dapper solid-color suits (Kevin in 
green, Joe in blue, Nick in orange) 
instead of coordinated boy-band 
leather and black skinny jeans.
Though most of the show was spent 
on the main stage, they also walk to 
the B-stage on the other side of the 
room to where I sat at the top of the 
arena. During “Hesitate,” they stand 
on a levitating stage that propels 
them upwards, surrounded by a sea 
of phone flashlights. The song from 
the new album is Joe’s letter to his 
wife, actress Sophie Turner, and the 
emotional moment, with 
some of the crowd 
singing along but 
others simply listening, 
makes it intimate, even 
in a huge arena with 
thousands of people.
Sometime during the 
night Joe mentions how 
hard it was to choose 
the tracklist since they’ve 
recorded over 200 songs 
when you add up the 
studio albums, concert 
albums, and soundtracks 
they did for Camp Rock 
and their Disney show. 
They ask the crowd for 
requests and choose “Hello Beautiful” 
from their self-titled second studio 
album.
And again, the concert shifts, never 
staying in the same place, barging 
forward with momentum. Throughout 
the night, songs are introduced by 
cheesy but touching videos of the 
brothers and younger versions of 
themselves, who are so well-cast for a 
moment I thought they were using old 
footage. But they are well-produced 
and expensive-looking, taking place 
when the young boys are camping 
in the woods, playing in the street, 
or having fun at a carnival. The 
video signals the change to another 
throwback moment: present-day Nick 
The reunited boy band performs at PPG Paints Arena for on their comeback tour.

w
and his younger self meet on a blue 
light-tinged beach. The stage lights hit 
Nick alone on the B-stage, belting the 
first notes of “Jealous,” the biggest 
hit of his successful solo career. Joe 
appears on the main stage for the 
second verse, with Nick joining him for 
the chorus.
Then comes “Cake by the Ocean,” 
the big earworm hit from Joe’s funk-
pop band DNCE. It’s a fun summer 
song, and the screens brighten up the 
room with neon colors that match the 
rainbow stage lights rotating around 
the crowd. From confetti to yellow 
inflatable tube men to everyone 
screaming the lyrics, it’s electric.
During the two solo songs, Nick and 
Joe are only joined by the supporting 
band, sans Kevin. The oldest of the 
brothers doesn’t sing much and chose 
to pursue some business ventures and 
raise a family during the hiatus.
The next video follows Kevin walking 
through a green forest, accompanied 
by his two young daughters, stoic and 
strong. He meets his younger self and 
teaches him to play piano, as a grand 
piano is lowered from the ceiling in 
front of the screen, onto the stage. The 
real Kevin, the one 
there in the arena, 
takes his place at the 
piano and plays the 
first rousing notes 
of “Comeback,” the 
closing song of the 
comeback album, 
and is joined by his 
brothers.
If the concert had 
ended there, I doubt 
anyone would have 
left unsatisfied. But the 
band knows what the 
crowd wants, and dives 
into performances 
of emotional banger 
“When You Look Me 
In The Eyes” and “I 
Believe.” Back on the B-stage, they 
take a break to speak to their fans, 
saying, “Thank you for sticking by 
us,” and drink a shot together in 
celebration.
“Let’s do something special for the OG 
Jonas Brothers fans.” And they do, 
playing a long medley of old hits and 
some lesser-known cuts. And the OG 
fans — the young girls who decorated 
their bedroom walls with merch and 
bought every CD five times — they 
feasted, singing lyrics to 
each other, jumping up 
and down, instantly 
transported to 10 
years ago. Others 
might have been fans 
simply because being 
a young girl in the late 
2000s meant you were 
a Jonas Brothers fan, 
even if you didn’t know 
every lyric to every 
song. That was me, 
but it’s okay because 
I can follow along to 
some of the lyrics and 
move to their solid, 
catchy melodies. Their 
older stuff has a much 
more rock sensibility, 
with heavy electric guitar and even 
heavier drums, and injected the show 
with new energy.
While their comeback single 
“Sucker” has been a huge bona 
fide hit in 2019 pop music, the band 
knows that for their passionate fans, 
nothing beats the old hits. When 
“Lovebug” begins, and later “Year 
3000,” I don’t think I’ve ever been 
around more screams, around so 
much sound in my ears. For the 
encore, they jump out from below the 
stage and launch into “Burnin’ Up” 
and “Sucker,” a partnership of their 
biggest hit from pre-hiatus and their 
recent single.
And as they barrel to the big finish, 
the lights flash over the whole arena 
and I can see the thousands of 
people here. We’re singing — no, 
screaming — at the top of our lungs, 
dancing to the music, laughing with 
our friends, and for two hours, 
we’re kids again. It’s thunderous, 
absolutely deafening, the sound 
traveling up to my seat. But it doesn’t 
matter that my ears barely work, or 
my feet hurt from standing all night. 
Because in this moment, all we feel 
is the freedom, the joy, the complete 
happiness of being here.

German pop singer Megan Bülow, 
known professionally as bülow, came to 
perform at Carnegie Mellon on Friday, 
Sept. 6. The 18-year-old emerging artist 
kicked off the new school year with a 
memorable performance on the CFA 
Lawn in front of Hunt Library.
Hip-hop duo AWFBEAT, comprised 
of sophomores Grant Glazier and 
Uni Hunte, opened the concert. They 
performed their two recent releases, 
“Better Than Me” and “Side Eyes.” The 
energy between the duo was fantastic, 
and the audience felt it. “Side Eyes” 
had the audience dancing and singing 
along. In an hour, the pair more than 
adequately hyped up the audience for 
bülow.
bülow kicked off the concert with her 
song “Wake Up” from her latest release, 
Crystalline. The performance also 
included her hot tracks “Sweet Little

Lies,” “Not a Love Song,” and “You & 
Jennifer” (the third which she prefaced 
with an apology to any Jennifers in 
the audience), as well as a brief cover 
of Juice Wrld’s “Lucid Dreams.” Her 
performance and presence felt just 
as effortless as her chill synth beats. 
Although bülow has been compared to 
current pop sensation Billie Eilish, this 
performance showed that bülow’s take 
on synthetic beats and harmonized vocals 
differentiates the two artists.
I had been a fan of bülow prior to 
the performance. Her song with The 
Chainsmokers, “Do You Mean,” and a 
recommendation from RM of BTS, “You & 
Jennifer,” put bülow on my radar. She is 
now amassing over three million listeners 
on Spotify, and her career seems to be 
expanding. Now that she has completed 
high school and can fully invest her 
efforts in her career, bülow is bound to 
go far with her music.

Lover

In her 13-year career, there have been count-
less stories and think pieces about Taylor 
Swift. In the beginning, they covered her great 
songwriting and her early success in country 
music. Then it was her many relationships, 
which ended up being chronicled in her songs. 
Then came the scandals and controversies, 
the constant beef with celebrities that 
led to her “canceling” after being 
“exposed” by Kim Kardashian 
West, and her political neutrality 
during the 2016 election when 
many called for her to speak. Swift 
is one of those figures who cannot 
be considered solely in the context 
of her music. Not only does her 
celebrity feed into her music, but it 
is an integral part of the Taylor Swift 
Experience.
Many will say that Lover, her seventh 
studio album, is a return to form. It’s 
certainly one of her best, but I think 
I’m in the minority that really enjoyed 
her last album, 2017’s reputa-
tion, her first release after 
experiencing the first “bad 
publicity” of her career. That 
album was experimental 
and heavily electronic, but 
under the combative songs was 
a romantic touch about a woman in love. The 
aftertaste of reputation was a happy one, a 
realistic one, and flows wonderfully into Lover, 
which fills out its title to a T.
Lover, with its 18 tracks, is the longest album of 
her discography, but it’s her most consistent. There 
may not be the highest of highs of 2012’s Red, 
which many consider her strongest work, or the 
singular achievement of writing all of 2010’s 
Speak Now by herself, but Lover covers a 
wider spectrum of a woman nearing 30 
who has already experienced a career 
that few could dream of. Not only is 
the subject matter widespread, but 
the sounds of the album are also 
diverse, from the comfortable 
electro-pop and ‘80s vibe to 
hints of jazz and R&B.
Kicking off the album with “I 
Forgot That You Existed,” the 
catchy melody overcomes the 
pettiness of the track, but I interpret 
it as a final nail in reputation’s coffin. 
The second track, “Cruel Summer,” is 
almost like a second opener, and kicks it 
off perfectly. Co-written with frequent 
collaborator Jack Antonoff and St. 
Vincent, “Cruel Summer” is the 
great pop song that pre-album 
singles “ME!” and “You Need To 
Calm Down” aren’t. It’s just great 
pop, with a layered, electronic 
production and killer turns of 
phrase that cut deep in a few 
short words: “I don’t wanna 
keep secrets just to keep you” 
and “I love you, ain’t that the 
worst thing you ever heard?”
12

---------------------------------------------------

For someone so incredibly detail-oriented and in complete control 
of her career, Swift has an odd knack for releasing her worst songs 
as lead singles. Granted, I understand the allure of “ME!” which 
features Brendon Urie, but its cheesy lyrics and a-little-too-much 
bubblegum aesthetic hinder an otherwise killer hook. Same with 
“You Need To Calm Down,” which is well-produced and has good 
intentions, but perhaps got a little too into her haters to be
considered a good effort at allyship.
But that doesn’t matter when you have the great country-tinged title 
track, a cozy and comfortable love song that’s sure to dominate 
weddings for years. “I Think He Knows” is bursting with sass that 
feeds into the love-soaked joy of “Paper Rings” and “London Boy,” 
which are undoubtedly Antonoff productions with their eighties 
influence. For someone who spent much of her career writing about 
fantasy crushes and breakups, Swift writes a solid love song, even 
if “London Boy” has 100 too many British references.
“The Man” caused the most headlines at the release of the album, 
with Swift going in on the double standards and sexism she
experiences in the music industry, and sings about how she would 
be treated and viewed if she was a man. For all her white feminism 
and convenient use of feminism in years past, “The Man” works 
well because she’s speaking from her unique and singular
experience which is so much more genuine than grand
generalizations about sexism from a privileged celebrity.
Though “The Archer” comes in at track 5 and “Afterglow” at 15, 
they represent Swift at her most introspective. “The Archer” is 
moody and dark and confessional, with a low pulsing beat under 
some truly honest lines like “All the king’s horses, all the king’s men 
/ couldn’t put me together again” and “They see right through 
me / Can see you see right through me / I see right through me.” 
While “The Archer” comes from a wider perspective, “Afterglow” 
comes very clearly in the middle of a relationship, with Swift
apologizing for mistakes and hurting her partner, and working to 
actually fight for the relationship.
Probably my favorite of the entire album, “Miss Americana & 
The Heartbreak Prince” first sounds like a darker version of “You 
Belong With Me,” with its high school setting, cheerleader chant-
ing in the bridge, and classic American characteristics. But Swift 
turns the metaphor on its head, and the song turns into almost a 
political commentary about disillusionment in America: “American 
stories burning before me / I’m feeling helpless, the damsels are 
depressed / Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?”
“Cornelia Street” is already a fan-favorite, blending the uber-
specificity Swift always imbues in her songs with the universal 
emotion of being afraid to one day lose to the person you’re with 
because you love them so much. Unlike some of the songs on repu-
tation which lacked the deep, specific details because she was sing-
ing about a relationship she was still in, “Cornelia Street” and other 
songs on Lover work past this. After three years with her boyfriend, 
actor Joe Alwyn, Swift is comfortable enough to truly share it.
In a radio interview, Swift revealed that break-up song “Death By 
A Thousand Cuts” joined a small group of her songs not about her 
own life, but instead was inspired by the 2019 rom-com, Someone 
Great. With interesting vocal layering, the song reminds me of 
reputation standout, “Getaway Car,” but for me, it recedes to the 
background among the album’s best songs. On the other end of 
the spectrum, Swift gets as personal as one can get with “Soon 
You’ll Get Better.” With an assist from the Dixie Chicks, the song is 
about her mother’s battle with cancer, with the truest, realest vocal 
delivery she’s ever put on record. She repeats the title line over 
and over as if trying to will it to come true.
The two songs before the closer find Swift experimenting with new 
genres. “False God” jolted me from the emotions of “Soon You’ll 
Get Better” with jazzy saxophone in the beginning. At first, the 
brass felt out of left field and it didn’t sound like a Taylor Swift 
song, but it grew on me. “It’s Nice To Have A Friend” is another 
curveball, with steel drum, a choir, and a clipped vocal. It’s a short 
song with a simple premise, but it’s a welcome flashback to simpler 
times in grade school with friends, surrounded by the imperfections 
of adult life that make up the rest of the album.
From 1989’s “Clean” to reputation’s “New Year’s Day,” Swift 
knows how to close an album. “Daylight” is no different. Sprinkled 
throughout Lover are many references to color, and here she goes 
back to red. In the album Red she used the color to describe love, 
when she was younger and more naïve. But in “Daylight,” we see 
the growth that comes from the beginning of your twenties to the 
end of them. In the bridge, she sings “I once believed love would 
be burning red / But it’s golden / Like daylight.”
With Lover, Swift drops clues to what she could do next. Maybe 
more R&B, or perhaps going back to her country roots. But that 
doesn’t matter, because with this album, she reminds us that 
beyond her celebrity, her relationships, her beef, her political 
beliefs, her reputation, she is a brilliant songwriter, and that shines 
through everything.

This weekend, Disney’s live-action Aladdin will be screening 
in McConomy Auditorium. The retelling of the beloved 1992 
animated film features Will Smith as the legendary Genie, 
Mena Massoud as Aladdin, and Naomi Scott as Jasmine. For 
lovers of the original film, this movie may not live up to the 
magic of the original tale — a tale of a charismatic “street 
rat” who unleashes a genie and pursues a princess and, 
quite frankly, crushes “One Jump Ahead”. Unfortunately, this 
retelling may seem to be plotless, even lumbering aimlessly 
and confusedly at points. But, while the film may lack the 
good storytelling and inspiration of the original, it’s all-star 
cast is all-attractive. So if you want to stare at a bunch of 
super hot people for two hours, I’d definitely recommend!
