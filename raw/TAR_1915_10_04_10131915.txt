Our Team Will Be Out for Blood. 
Exciting Contest and Large 
Crowd Expected.
After the athletic solidness of last 
week, it is with relief that we can turn 
to the game next Saturday knowing 
that there will be nothing on this oc­
casion that will not be of the clean­
est sort of sportsmanship. Ever since 
1906 we have been competing in vari­
ous sports with Allegheny College of 
Meadville, and our teams have always 
received the best of treatment at their 
hands and there never has been the 
least trace of unsportsmanlike conduct 
to disturb the relations between the 
two institutions.
In football, Allegheny have been 
our most consistent opponents. They 
were on the schedule of the first team 
representing Carnegie in 1906, when 
we won, 5-0, and except for the year 
1912, when there was some disagree­
ment as to where the game should be 
played, the two teams have fought it 
out each fall. Of the resulting eight 
games we have lost five and won 
three, but due to a large score in Al­
legheny’s favor in three of the games, 
they are far ahead in total points 
scored, the summation giving them 
eighty to our thirty-three. Last year 
the team from up state won, 26-7.
Saturday’s contest should be very 
close, and a pretty one from the grand 
stand. Always represented by an ex­
cellent team, well coached, the Meth­
odists play a fine article of ball, us­
ing the open style of play, with much 
passing. With them the Tech game

Students interested in Psychology 
and those wishing to fit themselves 
for teachers will be glad to hear of 
the new courses which are being of­
fered by the School. Director Hain- 
merschlag has felt for some time that 
a course in Psychology' should be 
given to the students of all the 
schools. The regular schedules have 
been too heavy to add such a course, 
however. It has been decided to run 
classes on Tuesday and Thursday 
nights and Saturday mornings. This 
will enable those who can to follow 
up the course, carrying their regular 
schedule besides.
Two new men have been secured. 
Professor Bingham and .Professor 
Minor, together with Mr. Zerbe, In­
structor in Psychology, and Peda­
gogy in the Industry School, will have 
charge of the new work.

evening will be featured by an address

Board of Governors Hold Meeting. 
Large Gathering Expected.
The Board of Governors of the 
Alumni Association held a meeting in 
the club room of the Industry build­
ing last Saturday night to discuss 
the plans for the smoker which is to 
be given by the Association in a few 
weeks. The exact date set for this 
event will be the first Friday in No­
vember, which will be November fifth. 
The Smoker is not intended for the 
alumni of the Industry School alone, 
nor is it intended alone for students 
of the Industry School, but for all 
Tech men, both day and night stu­
dents. It is such gatherings as this 
which do much to promote a closer 
relationship between all the schools 
and inasmuch as it serves this pur­
pose it is not only commendable that 
the alumni of the Industry School 
are taking this step, but they are espe­
cially deserving of much credit inas­
much as such gatherings between all 
the schools fill a real need in the so­
cial life of Tech. There is a great 
tendency for the different schools to

AVO CLUB MEETS.
Plans Laid for Celebration of Edison 
Day.
Carnegie Tech needs a rousing, 
cheery war song for its gridiron he­
roes, one that will echo down through 
the history of Tech and become as­
sociated with it much as the “Boola- 
boola” song of Yale or the “Big Red 
Team” of Cornell. Tech’s “Alma 
Mater” and her “Amici” are typical 
of the sentiment of every loyal Car­
negie Techite, and each of these songs 
are beautiful. What true heart of the 
Plaid does not feel a thrill permeate 
his entire being whenever the famil­
iar strains of these airs are struck? 
But singing these tunes to instill en­
thusiasm into an eleven who are 
fighting with all their power to win, 
or playing it for a field demonstra­
tion between quarters, is much like 
playing “The Star Spangled Banner” 
at an oriental ball.
Now here is the point. The 1916 
Thistle Board, realizing the need of 
such a song, has undertaken a compe­
tition, the result of which it is hoped 
will be a real foot ball song. The 
conditions of the contest have been 
posted on the bulletin boards of your

Lack of Proper Athletic Principles 
Compels Complete Breaking of 
Relations.
The first meeting of the Avo Club 
this semester was held on September 
23rd. The most important business 
transacted was the election of officers 
for the coming year. Owing to the 
fact that the president, O. D. Kings­
bury, who was elected at the close 
of the last semester, is not back in 
school, a new president had to be 
elected. The officers elected are as 
follows: President, W. C. Gloekler;
vice president, H. E. Fox; secretary, 
R. W. Cost; treasurer, G. A. Garrett; 
publicity manager, J. M. Moore.
The club is working on a program 
for Edison Day, which comes on Oc­
tober 21st, but the club will celebrate 
it on Friday, October 22nd, in order 
that all the students in the Industrial 
School may attend. Papers will be 
read on appropriate subjects by differ­
ent members of the club and liberal 
use will be made of lantern slides and 
possibly motion pictures. The cele­
bration of Edison Day was inaugu­
rated last year by the Electrical 
Equipment and Installation Depart­
ment, and as it was very successful 
the club hopes to make it even more 
so this year.
In these days of reform in poli­
tics and amateur athletics, dishonor 
in the latter has become rather a rare 
occurrence and especially such a raw 
and brazen example as was exhibited 
last week by the athletic authorities 
of the University of West Virginia. 
As a result, the faculty and athletic 
directors of this institution felt it 
necessary to cancel the Tech-W. Va. 
game or place themselves in the posi­
tion of condoning the break a basic 
principle of honor, long established 
in all intercollegiate athletics.
Week before last, Director of Ath­
letics, McCulloch notified U. of W. 
Va. by letter that we protested one 
of their players, Rodgers, on the 
ground that he had taken part in in­
tercollegiate contests for four pre­
vious years, especially against this 
institution. Nothing further was 
heard until Tuesday, when over 
the phone, West Virginia’s faculty 
athletic adviser declared that they 
considered Rodgers eligible. After a 
conference here, our authorities tele­
graphed for a written statement from 
U. of W. Va. as to their position.
This followed the next day and re­
iterated the previous conversation by 
phone. We immediately wired back 
that we would cancel unless Rodgers 
was declared ineligible. A reply fol­
lowed that they would promise to 
keep him out of the game because of

RADIO CLUB MEETS THURS­
DAY NIGHT.
Plans for the Year To Be Laid.
The Radio Club of C. I. T. will hold 
their first monthly meeting in the 
club room of the Machinery Hall 
tower tomorrow night at seven-thirty. 
To this meeting are invited all men 
in the schools, day or night, who are 
interested in radio telegraphy.
The last of the sending equipment 
arrived last week and has been trans­
ferred to the club room where instal­
lation work will be begun at once. 
This included the 10 K. W. 500 cycle 
M. G. set and the transformer.
Plans for the installation will be 
discussed at the meeting as well as 
other routine club business. It is ex­
pected that the set will be in operation 
by Carnegie Day, November 23rd.

HIGH SCHOOL INSIGNIA.
At the beginning of each school 
year there are certain unwritten laws 
which must be brought to the atten­
tion of those of our number who bear 
the title—plebe. And one of these 
things is in reference to the high 
school insignia 'worn by the “last 
year’s seniors” of various high schools 
and preparatory schools. At the time 
when these insignia were won they 
represented an honor or the accomp­
lishment of some endeavor which in 
its purpose was worthy and which we 
do not mean to belittle, but when 
these insignia are worn on the cam­
pus of a school which has absolutely 
no interest in the past achievement 
of a school whose standards are en­
tirely different, then the wearing of 
such insignia is not only out of place 
but shows a lack of judgment and 
a lack of progress in grasping the 
ideals of a higher institution. And 
the same holds true in regard to the 
wearing of high school pins, and 
again we do not wish to make light 
the value of the high school frater­
nity although we would suggest that 
there is hardly a shadow of doubt 
that the college fraternity is a higher 
type organization, not only as an or­
ganization but higher in its ideals. 
The point that we wish to express is
that the wearing of all such emblems 
is not good practise about the campus 
of such institutions as Tech. Such 
things are, or at least should be, rel­
ics of the past to the plebe. Every 
one goes through certain stages and 
attains certain material outward in­
dications of development which at the 
time are held in the- highest esteem 
but which later, at a point of greater 
progress appear insignificant. And so 
it is with the high school insignia, and 
the fact that any plebe will still wear 
these “relics” is only indicative of be­
ing “behind the time.”
SUPPORTING "STUDENT 
MERCHANTS.”
There are quite a number of stu­
dent merchants in Carnegie, who are 
here for a purpose. Why not support 
them? These young men are doing 
this work not just for the fun of it, 
but to enable them to gain an educa­
tion. In several instances a man has 
put himself through Carnegie in vari­
ous enterprises, dealing in the needs 
of a student.
Carnegie, like other schools, has 
just such men working hard for suc­
cess. The average student has many 
needs and has to throw his business 
some place, so why not help your 
brother student who may not be as 
fortunate as you? You need school 
supplies, laundry work, toilet articles, 
etc., so place your order where you 
shall get the value of your money and 
at the same time do a worthy act. We 
are sure that the “Student Merchant” 
will give you as much for your money 
and possibly more, than the average 
merchant.
THE SEANNACHIE SOCIETY.
The Seannachie was organized 
March 6th, 1912, by upper classmen 
who saw the need of an organization 
in the school which would give voice 
to the opinions of the majority of the 
student body of the Institute and 
through the influence of its members, 
bring about needed steps in the im­
provement of school conditions.
It should be considered the highest 
honor of a man’s college career to be 
elected to this society and to assist 
in the growth of his Alma Mater. The 
society elects its own members from 
those men who have shown them­
selves leaders in the various recog­
nized Varsity activities, and aims to 
bring together the leaders of the men’s 
schools in a common fellowship for 
the betterment of conditions about 
the schools.
Such a society deserves the hearty 
co-operation of every man in the 
school. In fact, the society can not 
fulfil its object without the willing 
support of the entire student body. 
Every man in the school should be 
vitally interested in the school activi­
ties. Every man may see some way 
in which some one or more activity 
may be helped. Put your suggestion 
in writing and sign it without fear 
of publication. Give this to some 
member of the Seannachie and you 
will be doing something to better 
conditions in Carnegie. The Sean­
nachie appreciate past co-operation of 
the student body and hopes for a 
continuance of it in the year of 1915- 
16.
A WORD TO THE FRESHMAN.
The newcomers to this Institution 
are here to receive the greatest pos­
sible benefits that can be had from 
the nurture of a large school. Those 
who are not here with this intent are 
working to their own detriment. Let 
it be well understood that your duty 
to yourself has not ended in com­
pleting your prescribed course, but 
to participation in activities.
Participation in the college activi­
ties opens the way to a larger and 
broader education than does the 
“book learning.” Develops, in your 
spare moments, those qualities which 
you possess in addition to scholastic 
ability.
When you have finished your 
course at Carnegie and have planned 
your career, a few things appear in 
your path that call to mind your ne­
glect of duty to yourself. Your abil­
ity to judge character, to develop in­
terest, to meet other men, to have 
other knowledge than formulae and 
technical methods, to speak your 
thought in other language than mere 
engineering and artistic terms, to 
command, to obey, and to organize 
your own abilities and weakness may 
be inadequate. It is acknowledged 
that it is practically impossible to 
teach any branch in four years that 
will at the same time broaden the 
mind of the individual. It is up to 
you, whether you shall be success­
ful or not. “Do everything that is 
expected of you!”
You shall, no doubt, experience 
more or less trouble and inconven­
ience in finding out just what is ex­
pected of you, but the value received 
will be more than worth this price.
LAWTOCHFRARIE.
The following present sophomores 
have been elected to membership in 
Lawtochfrarie, the honorary sopho­
more society: A. J. Hanks, J. B. 
Shumaker, J. S. McFeaters, R. E. Mc­
Cracken.
The present plebe class should 
note that this society is distinctly 
honorary, only men who have dis­
tinguished themselves in activities 
are chosen for membership.
KNOCKER vs. BOOSTER.
WHEN
the Creator had made all good 
things, there was still more work to 
do, so he made the beasts and rep­
tiles and poisonous insects, and when 
he had finished he still had some 
scraps, that were too bad to put into 
the Rattlesnake, the Hyena, the Scor­
pion and the Skunk, so he put these 
together, covered it with suspicion, 
wrapped it in jealousy, marked it with 
a yellow streak and called it a 
KNOCKER 
THIS product was so fearful to 
contemplate that He had to make 
something to counteract it, so He
took a sunbeam and put in the heart 
of a child and the brain of a man 
and then wrapped these in civic pride, 
covered it with brotherly love, gave 
it a mask of velvet, and a grasp of 
steel, made it a lover of fields and 
flowers and manly sports, a believer 
in equality and justice and called it a 
BOOSTER
Case Tech.
CO-OPERATION.
The following article by Dr. Es- 
querre should be carefully read by 
each student, as it concerns his per­
sonal welfare. With too many co­
operation is a forgotten word, but 
certainly it is badly needed here in 
Dr. Esquerre’s department. Tech 
men should learn to forget their in­
dividual tastes to the good of the 
whole.
Co-operation, or “The art of get- 
toing together” an old term much 
used in print, seldom put into prac­
tice should, of all places, find in Col­
lege life the fullest measure of ex­
pression because youth with its ideals, 
its enthusiasms, its freedom from the 
temptations of business (or profes­
sional life, its unity of objection, is 
ideally placed to practice “coopera­
tion” in the full, pure essence of the 
meaning of the word. To this school, 
it can show its willingness along two 
very important and well defined 
points:
Dormitory
Restaurant.
First year of Dormitory life in the 
history of the Schools—an experi­
ment started on the broadest demo­
cratic principles, implies self-govern­
ment. This, in turn, presupposses 
self-restraint. Restaurant is based 
upon thoughtful consideration of 
what our prerogatives as individuals 
actually are and of the point at which 
their exercise may interfere with the 
comfort or happiness of our neighbor. 
A cornetist, two vocal enthusiasts, 
three immoderate and intempestive 
whistlers, a few thoughtless individ­
uals who going out at night without 
their keys insist upon waking up the 
janitor five or six times between 10:30 
and 12 P. M., will certainly interfere 
with the proper workings of coopera­
tion, with the possibility of comfort 
or pleasure in dormitory life.
The Restaurant is probably the 
proposition which should enlist the 
greatest and most consistent cooper­
ative effort. The student viewing the 
situation from the point of view of 
an appetite more or less disciplined, 
guided by tastes and idiosyncracies 
as different as there are students sel­
dom considers, we believe, the diffi­
culties inherent to the following prob­
lem :
How to feed, properly, satisfactor­
ily, on 50 cents per day a group of 
growing boys, utilizing only the fresh­
est and best foods procurable on the 
market, preparing it in the most pal­
atable manner compatible with cook­
ing in large quantities.
How to serve quickly, in restricted 
quarters, 600 meals at noon, more

than two-thirds of which will be 
called for during the first 40 minutes 
of the two hours for service.
He may also seldom think that the 
Restaurant has been installed for his 
own personal benefit, that the School 
is not interested in the proposition 
except as a part of the problem of 
health, and that all efforts are being 
bent to give the student in food, actu­
ally purchased the largest percentage 
of his $3.50 per week.
He still less frequently may give 
consideration to the accuracy and 
closeness of judgment and calculat­
ions necessary to balance a menu 
which will meet his needs and allow 
the saving necessary for expenses and 
a working margin as small as 50 cents 
per day.
Objecting to stews, to meat loaves, 
he may not have thought that stews 
must be served to utilize certain parts 
of a carcass of beef or of ten lambs 
when the roasted portions have been 
served at one meal, or that it should 
be more agreeable to his digestion 
and to his satisfaction to be served 
a meat loaf or a hamburger steak 
made from chopped round steak than 
to be served that same round steak as 
steak more or less tough, more or 
less eatable.
Examples of this kind could be 
cited ad infinitim, this will suffice, 
we believe, to show that cooperation 
will be a fact when the student body 
realizes that there is always a reason 
back of the actions of the manage­
ment of the Restaurant, that that rea­
son is always dependent upon the 
thoughtful consideration of a problem 
at best hard of solution, the solving 
of which constantly revolves around 
two factors, the interest and welfare 
of the student body.
The Southern Club held a meet­
ing at the Club House on October 
4th for the purpose of adopting new 
amendments to the charter of the 
Club and arranging for the social 
welfare of the Club. Among the 
amendments being one which re­
quires the president of the club to live 
in the club house. With the adop­
tion of the amendment, Mr. Crump 
was elected President Pro Tem., the 
president to be elected at the next 
club meeting. Also the following 
men were nominated and are to be 
voted upon at the next meeting: Vice 
President, (Design) Wilson, Crowe, 
Mosby; Vice President, (Science) 
Landiig, Bennett; Vice President, 
(Ind.) Baird, Vance; Keller, Robin­
son.
The club will give a dance for its 
members on Friday night after Hal­
lowe’en. This is the first of a series 
of social events to be given by the 
club. Later on a dance will be given 
for the friends of the club.
The club is looking forward to these 
events with a great deal of pleasuer, 
which will tend to give a more social 
life to the club.
The last meeting of the club was 
a very enthusiastic one, as the mem­
bers are going to put the Southern 
Club first, among the clubs at C. I. 
T. The next meeting will be held 
Monday night, October 18, and all 
Southern men are asked to be pres­
ent, to aid in the election of officers 
and other business.
Union Closed.
The Carnegie Student Union room 
was closed last Thursday in order 
to sandpaper the floor. It is expected 
that this work will be finished in 
about a week.
The faculties of the Carnegie In­
stitute of Technology, through their 
Executive Council, wish to express 
their deep sorrow at the death of J. 
Hartley Anderson, and extend their 
sincere sympathy to the members of 
his family.
Beloved by every student to whom 
he ministered so skillfully and with 
such unfailing good cheer, no mem­
ber of the faculty has rendered a serv­
ice comparable to his in protecting 
the health of the student body. His 
loss is irreparable, but his spirit and 
influence will live among us always.
We send this message in the hope 
that it may bring some comfort to 
sorrowing hearts, so many of whom 
are this day grieving with you and 
mourning the loss of one of our most 
valued friends and associates.

FOOT BALL TEAM HAS NAR­
ROW ESCAPE.
The members of the foot ball squad 
who motored to Akron, Ohio, Satur­
day are congratulating themselves 
that they are not resting in a hos­
pital. The party which consisted of 
Coach Steffen, Kesner, Marshall, 
Hellstrom, Altdoerfer and Homer was 
returning from the U. of Akron and 
Allegheny game when the machine 
which was traveling at a high rate of 
speed, skidded to one side and leaped 
in the ditch. Owing to the skillful work 
of chauffeur, Lauer, the car remained 
upright. The machine was finally in­
duced to return to the road after sev­
eral hours’ labor and the remaining 
journey was made without mishap.
TECH VIEWS FOR SALE.
Tech students who are interested in 
securing some first class views of the 
school, its buildings and equipment, 
will be glad to hear that these may be 
purchased at a very reasonable price 
at the post office in the Administration 
building. The views come in a num­
ber of forms, all of which are beautiful 
sepia prints. They may be purchased 
in single post cards at one cent apiece 
or in the form of an album containing 
twenty-four views for twenty cents. 
A smaller form containing twenty 
views on souvenir picture stamps may 
be obtained for eight cents. These 
cards contain the following views: 
Schenley Park view of Carnegie Tech; 
M. M. C. S. for Women; School of 
Applied Industries; School of Applied 
Science; School of Applied Design; 
West End of Campus; Machinery 
Hall; Entrance to M. M. C. S.; Car­
negie Institute; and many views 
showing the interior and equipment 
of the buildings.
MANAGERIAL COMPETITION.
Second Assistant Manager of Track 
Team.
Already the call has been made for 
candidates for second assistant man­
ager of the track team. The contest 
is open to both plebes and sopho­
mores and without a doubt will bring 
forth much managerial material from 
both classes. It offers a chance to 
make a letter to the fellow who is not 
a good athlete and should be thor­
oughly considered by all. No time 
is to be lost by any one that wants to 
compete as the position is a much 
coveted one and the sooner the work 
is started the better the chances of 
succeeding will be. Therefore anyone 
who considers the proposition should 
report at once to Manager Schwein 
and get started to work.

GUILD CAMPAIGN.
Last Tuesday was tag day in M. M. 
C. S. The proceeds were for the 
benefit of the Guild, which is the char­
itable organization of the school. At 
all hours of the day, on every floor, 
one could find girls with hands out­
stretched, stopping every one with the 
query, “Have you bot a tag?” In the 
Recreation Hall, booths were arrang­
ed with different girls in charge. At 
one, Miss Grace Crawford, and Miss 
Jane Rogers took the names of the 
girls who promised either to knit 
or buy a pair of socks for Major 
Day’s soldiers. At another, the girls 
signed up for practical work in social 
service under the guidance of Miss 
Margaret Worth. The most unique 
of all was in charge of Miss Regina 
Jacobs and Miss Francis Willis, at 
which every girl voted concerning the 
kind and time of meetings for the 
Guild, which they were willing to sup­
port. Miss Hazel Thomas was in 
charge of the refreshment committee 
which served tea and cakes to all visi­
tors. The aim of the Guild was to 
secure at least 200 members. Whe­
ther this was accomplished or not, 
has not been ascertained at time of 
writing, however, announcement of 
the outcome will be given later.
SORORITY PARTY.
Friday evening the Delta Theta 
Sorority gave a “Taffy Pull” at the 
home of Miss Charlotte Watson, in 
Butler street. The evening was spent 
in making taffy, playing games, the 
most important of which was Truth, 
and music. Miss Virginia Campbell 
gave several readings which, as usual, 
brought forth well merited applause. 
The evening spent was most delight­
ful and was due principally to the ef­
forts of Miss Sanford and Miss Wat­
son, who arranged the details.
THE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.
The Athletic Association of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
was founded last year. Patterned 
after similar organizations in other 
colleges, it was from the first a suc­
cess. Its installation resulted in the 
awarding of sweaters and letters to 
the girls on the school basketball 
team, which was the first time such 
an award was made. At present the 
sports represented by different girls 
at their head are tennis, hockey, bas­
ketball. There is a tennis touranment 
going on now and and much excite­
ment is felt concerning the name of 
the victor. The winner will be pre­
sented with a sweater and letter.
Every girl interested in athletics, 
whether she is a member of a team 
or not, should belong to the associa­
tion. Later when basketball is or­
ganized, the ticket will entitle her to 
see the game as well as play in them. 
There is plenty of material in the 
school for good teams and some fast
playing will no doubt be seen. Es­
pecially the Plebes are urged to come 
up to the Gym. and try out. Even if 
you have never played before, there 
is a chance for you to practice and 
become an expert, perhaps a member 
of the school team. So all the girls 
of the school are urged to buy their 
tickets just as soon as possible from 
Regina Jacobs, treasurer.
At a later date, it is being planned 
to have an informal dance for the 
members, the proceeds to go to the 
association—so buy your tickets now, 
girls, only 50 cents.
ASSEMBLY FOR UPPER CLASS­
MEN.
The regular weekly assembly for 
Seniors, Juniors and Sophomores was 
held on Wednesday. The seats in the 
assembly hall have been numbered, 
and each girl was given a definite 
seat. Hereafter the attendance will 
be taken by the number of chairs va­
cant.
The dean talked to the girls for a 
few minutes and made several an­
nouncements. She spoke of the men­
tal tests being made on the Plebes 
and offered to th upperclassmen the 
privilege of being lambs on the altar 
of Science—don’t all speak at once, 
girls! She explained still further the 
new cut sytsem and asked the girls 
to remember NOT to eat their lunches 
in the corridors—although this fault 
seems to lie mostly with the Plebes.
TEA FOR THE PLEBES.
Friday afternoon in the Faculty 
Parlors the Seniors gave a tea for 
the Plebes and their faculty advisors. 
The hours were from 3:30 to 5:30, and 
the hostesses were glad so many at­
tended. The rooms were attractively 
decorated with palms and potted 
plants, having a centerpiece of yellow 
rosebuds and fern on the tea table. 
The name of each girl was pinned on 
her dress, thus making getted ac­
quainted easy, for the time was spent 
in connecting in one’s mind, the right 
face with the right name, and it is 
to be hoped that the proper combina­
tion will remain. Pineapple ice, cakes 
and wafers were served. Miss Lila 
Gilmore, social chairman of the Sen­
ior Class, together with her commit­
tee, deserve a great deal of credit for 
the social success of the afternoon.
DORM. DANCE.
The girls of the Fifth Avenue Dor­
mitory had an informal dance last 
Friday night. It was the first one of 
the year and was a decided success. 
Miss Struthers and Miss Marvin were 
the chaperones. Punch and wafers 
were served. Miss Rachel Pollock 
had charge of the affair and together 
with Miss Irene McNamee, house 
president, deserves the credit for its 
successful outcome.
DORMITORY TEA.
Sunday afternoon from 3:30 to 5:30 
were the hours for the tea which the 
girls of the Morewood Avenue Dorm, 
gave. A large number of guests were
present and enjoyed the hospitality 
of the girls. It is intended to have 
a tea every month, as was the custom 
last year. The committee in charge 
was Miss Burgham, Miss Hoag, Miss 
Cameron, Miss Brady, and Miss San­
ford, house president.
POINT SYSTEM.
Last year our Student Senate felt 
that the responsibility of offices was 
falling upon a few girls who were will­
ing to work and that others were not 
doing their share. In order to rem­
edy this they made out a system of 
points, under which no girl was to be 
permitted to hold more than ten 
points. This system is still in force 
this year. It is as follows:

APPLIED INDUSTRIES.
T’ne middle class held a meeting last 
Thursday afternoon. Twiford was 
/elected to the Student Deportment 
' Committee. After the reports from 
the various committees, the transac­
tion of further business was deferred 
until a later date, when it is hoped 
that the attendance will be much 
larger.
The regular meeting of the Stu­
dent Assembly was held on Wednes­
day, part of the session being occu­
pied by a very interesting talk from 
Dean Connelley.
“Si” Perkins and C. Young are 
again in our midst, having returned 
to school during the past week. Wel­
come back, boys. May the girls of 
Oakland greatly rejoice.
Jerry Lawlor is some busy with 
the Middles’ foot ball team. It will, 
no doubt, soon be necessary to ap­
point an assistant.
It is reported that Griffin, upper 
Installation, got rather fussed last 
Friday, when some of the Normal 
School girls, who were visiting us, 
became quite interested in a test on 
a meter, which he was running. As a 
consequence, all the fuses in the shop 
suffered.
Prof.—“Mr. Griffith can you define 
a hypocrite?”
Griff—“Sure! It’s a fellow who 
goes to math, class with a smile on 
his face.”

The Applied Industries Alumni As­
sociation will hold a smoker in the 
near future. A big time for every­
body is being planned, with boxing, 
music and plenty of smokes. The 
date of the smoker will be announced 
shortly.

draw apart and this is to a measure 
more or less natural as their interests 
lie in entirely different channels, but 
every Tech student should avail him­
self of this opportunity to meet fel­
low students of other schools.
The smoker will have enough at­
tractions to give every one there a 
most pleasant evening. Some amateur 
wrestling will be staged, boxing 
matches will be in evidence and all 
sorts of instrumental music is to add 
to the entertainment. And of course 
as the title of the affair would indi­
cate there will be all sorts of smokes 
to suit every one’s state.
The Industry Alumni Association 
was first founded in 1909 and has a 
membership of about 350 men of both 
the day and night school. The offi­
cers of the Association are: N. L.
Haas, president; G. Ralph Wagner, 
vice president; B. A. Lutton, secre­
tary; G. Naismith, treasurer. The en­
tertainment committee consists of the 
following members: William Ritts,

DORMITORY FOOTBALL.
The football team of the East 
Dorm, is fast rounding into shape un­
der the clever direction of the coaches, 
Garrett is backfield coach, Kutz line 
coach and “Sunny” Kesner coach for 
the quarterbacks. The squad has sev­
eral stars, one being Jack Furber, who 
promises to develop into a second 
Maulbetch, the Michigan star.
The big game of the season is to be 
with the West Dorm, team, which is 
managed and coached by “Tommy” 
Malie, assisted by “Speed” Finlay. 
The date of this game will probably 
be Saturday, October 16th.
The coaches of the East squad are 
having a hard task to pick a team on 
account of the large number of clever 
men out for the positions. The squad 
consists of the following men: Ward, 
Russell, Crandall and Hunter, ends; 
Jandernal, McCullough, O’Brien, Gar- 
lick, tackles; Schenk, Griffith, Soler, 
Tramonte, guards; McCairns, Hills, 
and Patterson, centers; Guthrie and 
Wilson, quarterbacks; Smith, Gal­
braith, Roberts and Wendell, half­
backs; Furber, fullback.
There will be an important prac­
tice Saturday morning at 9:30 o’clock, 
at which time the coaches will give 
out several new plays. All the above 
men and any other East Dorm, men 
wishing to try out are expected to be 
there.
West dorm, will have a strong 
team in the field according to Man­
ager Ammerman. Competition is so 
keen that the lineup is very uncer­
tain.
The West Dorm, feels absolutely 
certain of being the initial possessors 
of the athletic trophy promised by 
the administration. After beating the 
East Dorm, they will challenge the 
school. Class and school teams take 
notice.

DORMITORY NOTES.
Guests at the Dorms, are given a 
warm reception. The window seats 
have been placed over the radiators.
The club room furniture has arrived. 
The piano is still missing. However, 
the authorities have furnished a jani­
tor who owns a phonograph.
The West Dormitory piano team 
consisting of Shutz, Boals and Bowen 
challenge the world.
The young lady across the way, 
after seeing the sleeping porches, 
wanted to know what kind of a sani­
tarium that was.
The janitor has treatened to charge 
the next man who wakes him up at
3 A. M. because he has forgotten the 
key to his room, ten cents. The only 
objection is that ten cents is not 
enough.
A safebreaker could earn a comfort­

I Design School Notes j
MR. BOSANGE ON “CULTURE.”
Editor’s Note—Owing to lack of 
room this article was unavoidably 
held over from last week.
The lecture on “Culture” given by 
Mr. Bosange before the student body 
on Friday morning in the Theatre of 
the School of Applied Design, met 
a long-felt need—in that he brought 
before his audience in a pleasant and 
convincing way, certain facts that the 
many overlook in their race for the 
coveted goal—and that is the inter­
dependence of all the arts upon each 
other for the most complete expres­
sion of any one of them and also 
that art is in itself, a means and not 
an end.
We understand him to mean that 
art is but the expression of the soul 
of the artist and is only valuable as it 
reflects and interprets the various 
phases of life itself and gives the liv­
ing spirit of the period from which it 
springs.
He gives the study of history a 
new value in the eyes of the reluctant 
student by showing him that it is the 
avenue through which he may enter 
into an understanding of modern 
times, which understanding, he con­
tends, is the end of the cultural atti­
tude. He cites the French Revolu­
tion as a time fraught with great ques­
tions—trusts, etc., similar to our own; 
the Greek civilization as the essence 
of refinement—which characteristic 
stamped itself upon its works of art; 
the Roman period as standing for 
magnificence—as shown in its splen­
did processions, etc., and demonstrat­
ing centralized power—the money 
again in the hands of the few; while 
the Romanesque, coming 1400 years 
after the Greek and about 1000 years 
after the Roman, is clumsy compared 
with either. The human race had 
begun to be worried over spiritual 
things and therefore paid little atten­
tion to beauty of line, etc., as we dis­
cover in works of this and the Gothic 
period,—but the struggle of man’s 
soul has been wonderfully expressed 
even if at times somewhat gro­
tesquely.
He drew attention to the import­
ance of the (spirit of the) mass in 
sculpture rather than of detail, which 
should be wiped out as much as pos­
sible.
His remarks, on the Cubist School, 
whose aim, he understands to be, to 
get as far as possible from initiation, 
wrere interesting—while his descrip­
tion of his first impressions of the 
theatre w^as both instructive and 
amusing although somewhat of a tax 
on one’s credulity when it came to 
the point of the bow legged king and, 
the trumpet blasts—as it is seldom 
in real life that “the punishment (so 
perfectly) fits the crime”—but it 
proves the speaker’s ability to hold 
an audience and score a point. He 
worked up to the climax skillfully 
closing with the statement, that to
know the technique and historical 
facts concerning an art is not enough 
—we must enter into the spirit of 
the artist emotionally rather than in­
tellectually. And with all due regard 
to the utilitarian spirit abroad in the 
land, he announces his belief in a 
culture which enriches, deepens and 
sweetens life by illuminating our un­
derstanding—quickening our sympa­
thies and making us ashamed of our 
pedantries.
The next lecture will be looked for­
ward to with interest.

MODERNISM.
Mr. Hornbostle lectured to the De­
sign students last Friday noon Upon 
Modernism. The key to this most 
astute lecture was the non-effect of 
past history upon our posterity. 
“Many hold,” said Mr. Hornbostle. 
“that the records of the events of 
past years will all be, to a marked 
degree, corroborated in the years to 
come. Quite wrong! this age and 
the era to come is, and will be, one 
of individualism; one of man power.” 
Speaking briefly in regard to the re­
sults of the war. “When the great 
blood-curse is over, we will be the 
richest nation of the globe; and the 
most hated too. Then, when the gold 
of all Europe is infused into our land, 
can we establish a real art. Then 
will be our opportunity to make 
America the nucleus of an art far 
superior to that of today, be at hand.” 
It pays to visualize just a little, to 
look a few years before us and ask, 
“What has the world in store for 
me?”
DESIGN NOTES.
At a sophomore class meeting of 
the Design students on October 5, 
Robert Vernon was elected to the 
Student Senate. The Design School 
is filled with competent men; men 
who are fit to lead and command, but 
we feel that no better choice could 
have been made.
L. C. Smith was elected second as­
sistant track manager. Smith is a 
man who is never so content as when 
he is in a position to serve his class; 
he has become permeated with the 
true “Tech” spirit.
George A. Cook was chosen as De­
sign representative for our year book, 
the “Thistle.”
The Nevember ball is now the ever 
present topic of discussion about the 
Design corridors. A meeting of the 
Design School officers was held on 
October 6 at which time each officer 
was partially assigned to his portion 
of work in preparation for the ball.
The young ladies of the training 
school livened up things a bit when 
they pranced gaily through the 
draughting room last Friday, headed 
by George Miller. Glad to see you, 
girls. Get George to bring you around 
again.
Whoever suspected (?) of be­
ing a “ladies’ man?” We’ve got (?) 
number now.
We noticed Mr. McGoodwin held 
tight to his chair and never looked
up once when the young ladies came 
through.
Henry C. Brockman seems to be 
enthusiastic over the ladies all of a 
sudden. Henry might let some of the 
rest of us poor and friendless in on 
a good thing.
While we’re discoursing on the 
subject, we can’t help calling atten­
tion to the way the Sophs are “get­
ting close” to the fair sex. Who was 
it that had a free hair cut last season 
for “chinning” the girls?
The Plebes have been recently un­
dergoing several trying ordeals. Two 
of them were considerably scared up 
at trials. They were fortunate enough 
to save their scalp, however.
Plebe inspection Friday afternoon 
failed to reveal anything contrary to 
Soph relations, excepting the promi­
nent fact that certain of the young 
ladies refrain from wearing the pre­
scribed black. We wonder thereat.
It looks like, old times again, the 
way the draughting room is crowded 
and busy. Come up any afternoon 
about four o’clock and see for your­
self.
While we’re at it, we may as well 
say that Messrs. Ellington and Bar­
ney are making many friends among 
the architects and have won their ad­
miration by their clever and efficient 
criticisms.
DORMITORY NEWS.
There was considerable excitement 
at the Dorms last Thursday evening. 
A number of men assembled in one 
of the rooms in the East Dorm, and 
started to send forth a combination of 
vocal and instrumental noises in­
tended to resemble music. However, 
170 men thought otherwise, and in a 
few moments a ducking party was or­
ganized. Their efforts were useless 
for the musicians were well barri­
caded. By this time nearly every man 
in the Dorms was out in the court be­
tween the buildings and they all 
united in an effort to drown the har­
mony. Suddenly the entire lighting 
system was turned off, but evidently 
the musicians were not playing by 
note for they kept right on. After the 
lights had been turned on some oblig­
ing young men threw about a barrel 
of water out of one of the West Dorm 
windows. For information to who 
got wet ask Cavett, Henning, and Gu- 
ter. Dutch wranted to borrow the 
barrel to go home in. Dr. Esquerre 
was down at Smithfield and Diamond 
streets, and hearing the noise hurried 
up, thinking that perhaps there was 
a fire or a lynching going on. Evi­
dently some one saw him coming, for 
when he arrived the only thing to be 
seen was Dutch Henning wringing 
out his clothes.
THE COMMONS BREAKS INTO 
MATHEMATICS.
A new theory of inequalities is be­
ing demonstrated in the Commons in 
a way that leaves no doubt in the mind 
of the student. If any hungry person 
will walk along the counter he will ob­
serve a price list for extra dishes.

Certainly you’ll be surprised at the 
suit values offered in our men’s 
$14.50 Clothes Shop
The suits we’re selling at this price were a surprise to us when first we saw them. We hesitated some time before deciding to take on a standard line selling at such a reasonable price. We feared the quality could not possibly measure up to our stand­ard, but the manufacturer has proven his line and the suits themselves have proven wonders—the tailoring is so perfect—the models so snappy and up-to-the-minute—the materials so much above par, and the quality of the suits as a whole far beyond what we thought was a possibility at such a price.These suits at $14.50 surely re­present a value that but few, if any, can duplicate— they are Pittsburgh’s greatest sellers, and your visit to this department will give you a genuine thrill of surprise, for

The Woodlawn Club entertained 
the members and lady friends with 
a delightful party at their house on 
Woodlawn avenue, Friday evening. 
Dancing and cards furnished the 
chief pastime, the music of the Wood­
lawn orchestra was pleasing indeed. 
Fellowship and good cheer prevailed 
throughout the evening and after a 
dainty luncheon was served the 
guests departed assuring their 
friends that they had spent a most 
pleasant evening.
Mr. Turnack has been appointed in­
structor in electro and physical chem­
istry, to take the place of Mr. Yount, 
who has gone to the Du Pont Powder 
Co. to accept an important position. 
Mr. Turnack is a graduate of the Uni­
versity of Illinois and took post grad­
uate work at the University of Wis­
consin. He has had three experiences 
as instructor in electro chemistry at 
Penn State College. He comes to us 
directly from Willis Overland Auto­
mobile people.

Busy Rushing Season Practically 
Finished.
One of the busiest times of the 
whole year for the fraternity man 
comes during the first few weeks of 
the new school year, in the endeavor 
to find such men amongst the incom­
ing class who appear to be likely ma­
terial to promote and further the in­
terest and ideals of their organiza­
tion. The material that the Tech fra­
ternities have found this year seems 
to have been of a good caliber judg­
ing from the number of men who 
have thus far been chosen to mem­
bership. The pledges of the frater­
nities are as follows:

H. E. Gumbart, an electrical en­
gineering graduate of last year, has 
completed the Standard Oil Corpor­
ation’s preparatory course for tech­
nical graduates who wish to be as­
signed to foreign posts, and word 
comes to us that he sails from San 
Francisco November 20th en route 
for Hong Kong, China, where he will 
take care of old agencies and estab­
lish new ones.
Each year the Standard Oil place 
a number of technical graduates in 
this way, and pays a very consider­
able salary. Two thousand dollars a 
year is a common figure. H. B. Apple­
gate, a commercial graduate of last 
year also took the course and has 
been accepted by the Company, but 
he has not yet been assigned to an 
agency.
1916 ELECT FINAL OFFICERS.
After the general lecture on Wed­
nesday, October 6th, the Science Sen­
iors elected officers for the last time. 
The meeting lasted from 11:30 to 
12:15, and in that time several vol­
umes of discussion might have been 
chronicled.
The candidates were practically all 
nominated the previous week and in­
cluded for President, Ingalls, Hen­
ning, Boak, Shea, Hines, Stevenson, 
Espy; for Secretary, Lain and 
Schwartz; and for Treasurer, Rieser, 
Guter, Kirk, and Ashworth.
The meeting was in charge of Claude 
Ettele at the request of the presi­
dent, Ingalls, since both the pres­
ident and vice president were nomi­
nees for office. This chairman han­
dled the turbulous meeting well, as 
was evidenced by the rising vote of 
thanks the class unanimously gave 
him at the conclusion.
The main issue under discussion 
was whether the election should be by 
elimination and thus a majority vote, 
or whether a plurality vote should 
elect. Arguments pro and con were 
advanced, and finally a compromise 
was adopted, in which two ballots 
were run for president. On the sec­
ond ballot only the three high men 
for president were run, and these 
were Shea, Tngalls, and Henning.
Two ballots result in Henning be­
ing elected President. Other officers: 
Shea, Vice President; Schwartz, Sec­
retary; Reiser, Treasurer.
Karl S. Henning, the president-elect, 
has been prominent in school affairs 
from the days of his Plebedom, hold­
ing office in his -class practically con­
tinuously, although he never was pres­
ident before. This year he is the foot­
ball manager which is the highest 
managerial position about school. 
Henning is a member of the Xi Sigma 
Upsilon Fraternity, and of the Delta 
Skull Junior Society.

W. VA. GAME CANCELLED
Continued from Page 1
injuries. The U. of W. Va. authori­
ties evidently had the impression that 
Tech was afraid of the man and was 
not thinking of the principle. A 
statement of our position and another 
quibbling reply from them resulted in 
the following telegram being sent on 
Friday.
The Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy regrets that it is compelled to 
cancel the football game scheduled on 
Tech Field with the University of 
West Virginia, for Saturday, October 
9. This action is taken to uphold the 
spirit and letter of collegiate competi­
tion.
It has been an accepted rule that 
students of our colleges are only el­
igible to play four years. This very 
wise provision is made for the pur­
pose of putting athletics in its rightful 
relationship to the life of the average 
student.
The University of West Virginia, 
wrhile admitting the facts in the case, 
nevertheless refuses to recognize this 
rule in the case of one of its players, 
who has competed for four years, rep­
resenting another college in West Vir­
ginia, and the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology is therefore compelled, in 
the interests of true intercollegiate 
standards of competition, to refuse to 
allow its team to compete with an in­
stitution which does not comply with 
this universal rule.
The case will be reported at the 
next meeting of the Intercollegiate 
Athletic Association of the United 
States.
This action wras supported by the 
entire student body and by other ath­
letic officials of the city, although the 
cancellation was a disappointment to 
many, as there would have been the 
largest crowd of the year at the game. 
The Tech management had made 
complete arrangements and suffered 
quite a financial loss.
Just what fatuous argument moved 
the U. of W. Va. authorities to this 
action is not evident. They said that 
their local merchants demanded that 
he play this season so that evidently 
financial reasons are placed above 
honor. Of course the time-worn ex­
cuse was advanced that Rodgers was 
only a prep student at Bethany, but 
we thought that that had been bur­
ied long ago when it was deemed set­
tled that when a man entered an in­
tercollegiate contest he w’as consid­
ered a college student. True, as w^as 
learned in a letter from Bethany, 
Rodgers only had two-thirds the 
number-of credits demanded* by West 
Virginia for entrance but he is never­
theless playing on their team and they 
have no prep department.
Just what effect this tangle will 
have on West Virginia will be evident 
later. Their already doubtful reputa­
tion in this district is completely gone. 
Geneva wall not protest next Satur­
day’s game and Bethany’s action the 
week following is doubtful. However, 
it is to be expected that both Wash­
ington and Lee and Wesleyan, both 
of whom have always had the highest 
athletic standards, will hardly stand
for such an evident disregard for the 
most conventional principle of ath­
letics.
CONTEST WITH ALLEGHENY
Continued from Page 1
is the most important contest of the 
year, and they will bring down prac­
tically the same excellent back field 
as last year, wTith Burt’s nephew, Mun- 
hall, at full. Only in the line did Al­
legheny lose by graduation, but re­
ports give them a large freshmen 
squad to draw from.
This year Allegheny will be up 
against the same proposition which 
we had to contend with last season. 
Then the Allegheny-Hiram game was 
cancelled for some reason, giving our 
opponents an idle Saturday the week 
before our game and bringing the 
team down here distinctly loaded for 
bear. This year we will not only be 
loaded for bear, but for goat also, and 
Allegheny’s in particular. After two 
weeks of nothing but scrimmage and 
signal practice the team should be on 
their toes for something more excit­
ing. We have the football and bas­
ketball seasons of last year to avenge.
Secret practice will be on the pro­
gram all week, as Coach Steffen de­
sires to work up a few pet ideas of 
his own. Kelley and Altdoerfer are 
again in shape and the whole squad is 
now going fine. The new charging 
machine used under direction of Dr. 
Marks is doing wonders with the line. 
We venture to say that Allegheny will 
hit, next Saturday, a harder proposi­
tion than they ever struck before on 
Tech Field, and it looks as though 
our Allegheny hoodoo and their rec­
ord of only one defeat in six years 
might strike a snag. Here’s hoping.
The new bleachers will be in use 
for the first time. They afford an ex­
cellent position for viewing the game, 
being close to the sidelines and are 
much preferable to the main stand. 
Conditions point to both being filled 
to the overflowing, Saturday.
In closing, let us express our sym­
pathy to those Allegheny scouts who 
expected to be on ‘hand and see us 
show all we had Saturday. We were 
in the same fix last year.
FOOTBALL SONG COMPETITION
• Continued from Page 1 
school. Prizes have been offered. Let 
everybody get together on this. The 
contest closes 6 P. M., Friday, Oc­
tober 22. The Tech Band wants this 
song to play at the games. We must 
have it for the “pee-rade” in Cleve­
land. We certainly must have it for 
the game with our rivals “on the 
hill.”
One and all, let us get after this 
song and produce in this school year, 
the Football Song of Carnegie Tech. A 
song to inspire to the utmost our own 
brave warriors, and finally a song 
which will ever be allied with past 
victories and future hopes of Tech.
