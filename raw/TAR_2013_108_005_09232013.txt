PARK(ing) Day transforms Oakland parking spaces
CHRIS GALVIN
Junior Staffwriter
This past Friday, members 
of the Pittsburgh community 
gathered for PARK(ing) Day, 
a one-day worldwide event 
where volunteers, including 
Carnegie Mellon students, 
convert metered parking spots 
into temporary public parks.
The PARK(ing) Day proj-
ect’s mission is “to call atten-
tion to the need for more ur-
ban open space, to generate 
critical debate around how 
public space is created and 
allocated, and to improve 
the quality of urban human 
habitat,” according to the 
PARK(ing) Day website.
The project was started by 
an art and design studio in 
San Francisco in 2005 and has 
since spread across the globe. 
The 2011 PARK(ing) Day in-
spired 975 parks in 162 cities, 
35 countries, and six conti-
nents.
Participants of the project 
have gone beyond the original 
pop-up park design to create 
one-day events within a me-
tered parking spot. 
These call attention to oth-
er social issues in their speci?c 
communities with projects 
like free health clinics, mini 
farms, political discussions, 
ecology demonstrations, and 
art installations.
Pittsburgh has participated 
in PARK(ing) Day since 2008, 
with up to 30 parks sprout-
ing around the city each year. 
Master’s student in design Em-
ily Abell and senior industrial 
design major Sharon Winter, 
along with four other gradu-
ate students in design, set up 
a parking spot on Forbes Av-
enue near Atwood Street last 
Friday from 8 a.m. – 3 p.m. 
They fed the meter and used 
an arti?cial grass carpet, pot-
ted trees, branches, stumps, 
and a makeshift bench to cre-
ate their park.
“We wanted to focus on 
recycling and sustainability; 
everything we used we found 
in our own backyards or in 
Schenley Park, except for the 
fake grass,” Abell said.
The group also included 
interactive components in 
their park, inviting passers-by 
to write their thoughts about 
public parks on Post-it notes 
and to plant seeds in dispos-
able cups from nearby food 
vendors. 
The notes were displayed 
in the park on wires strung 
between the potted trees; they 
included expressions of love 
for biking, hiking, picnick-
ing, and clean air, as well as 
sketches of parks and trees.
The park garnered atten-
tion throughout the day from 
pedestrians who frequently 
stopped to ask questions, write 
down their ideas, and even eat 
lunch with the students. “We 
got a group of of?ce workers 
from across the street. They 
said they had been watching 
us all day and just had to come 
down and see what we were 
doing,” Winter said.
Other memorable onlook-
ers included an enthusiastic

Bold: Get Noticed, Get 
Hired, a book written by a 
Tepper School of Business 
graduate and two Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh graduates, 
focuses on trying to make 
a meaningful connection 
with in?uential people in 
order to land a job.
The book was co-written 
by Liz Madsen (TSB ’11), 
Joshua Siva, and Melanie 
Feldman, Pitt graduates 
who took an entrepreneur-
ship course at Carnegie 
Mellon. It was of?cially re-
leased Aug. 27, and is avail-
able in physical or digital 
versions on Amazon. Bold’s 
website describes the book 
as “based on creative strat-
egies from real people who 
went from the middle of 
the résumé pile to the top,” 
promising, “We break down 
exactly what they did and 
how they did it so that you 
can build your own strategy 
off their success.”
“Especially to the atten-
tion span of a recent college 
grad, this book will be very 
useful. It gets to the point,” 
Feldman said.
The book covers exam-
ples and stories involving 
personalities such as ESPN 
sportscaster Neil Everett, as 
well as those of Alec Brown-
stein, who created a social 
media experiment where 
top advertising executives 
saw ads directed at them 
speci?cally when they per-
formed a Google search of 
their own names.
“Our goal was to have a 
product we can get behind 
and would read ourselves,” 
Feldman said.
“We’ve put everything 
behind this,” Siva said, add-
ing that reader feedback 
has “new ideas coming up 
in parallel.”
Madsen added, “the 
whole idea of the book is to 
help people land jobs,” and 
described the possibility of 
second and third editions 
containing stories and ex-
amples from readers.
Siva explained that their 
group “had tried all differ-
ent sorts of tech ventures, 
but none of us are coders. 
It just so happened that Mel 
had gotten a job in a very 
different way.”
Co-authors Siva and 
Feldman met in the Tepper 
class Topics in Entrepre-
neurship taught by profes-
sor R. F. Culbertson. Both 
Siva and Feldmen were Pitt 
students at the time, and 
took the class through the 
Tepper School of Business.

Michael J. Tarr will take 
up the role of head of the 
department of psychology 
in January 2014, according 
to a university press release. 
Tarr, currently the George A. 
and Helen Dunham Cowan 
Professor of Cognitive Neuro-
science, will succeed Michael 
Scheier, who has occupied 
the position for more than a 
decade.
Tarr, who grew up in Pitts-
burgh, joined the faculty in 
2009 after holding several 
positions at other universi-
ties. He received his Ph.D. 
from MIT in 1989, subse-
quently spending six years at 
Yale University and 14 years 
at Brown University before 
arriving at Carnegie Mellon. 
When asked why he chose 
to come to Carnegie Mellon, 
Tarr pointed to the “awesome 
interdisciplinary training” of-
fered by the psychology de-
partment.
His research focuses on 
how the brain takes 2-D im-
ages from the retina to create 
3-D perceptions of events and 
items. His faculty biography 
notes some of his areas of 
expertise, including face and 
object recognition, visual 
categorization, and computa-

Micah Rosa (TSB ’11) in 
his two years out of school 
with the launch of his media 
consulting business, Shout-
side Media. The company  
was featured in the Pittsburgh 
Business Times earlier this 
month.
Rosa’s knack for entrepre-
neurial endeavors started well 
before he graduated, when he 
created Shoutside Media’s 
predecessor SurhRosa in the 
course Introduction to Entre-
preneurship. 
According to the Pittsburgh 
Business Times, SurhRosa was 
“a Web design agency that 
grew from a class project to a 
business serving restaurants 
around the city.”
Now a CEO in the world 
of media advertising, Rosa 
offered advice to current and 
recently graduated Carnegie 
Mellon students.
Above all else, Rosa advo-
cated for the importance of 
computer skills in an increas-
ingly online world. 
“No matter what depart-
ment you are in, ?nd a com-
puter science student and be 
friends with them,” Rosa said 
in an interview. Otherwise, 
“bring the computer center 
cookies,” and ask to watch. 
“You need to know com-
puters. You need to know 
someone who really knows 
computers,” he said.
In the same vein, Rosa em-
phasized that students should 
“forget Spanish, forget Chi-
nese, forget Japanese … and 
learn Java or HTML5.”
Shoutside Media provides 
mobile website design and 
online advertising for com-
panies looking to participate 
more effectively in the infor-
mation age. Calling on the 
skills of computer program-
mers, Rosa has carved out a 
pro?table niche in the media 
world.

Carnegie Mellon named 
Neil M. Donahue as director 
of its Steinbrenner Institute 
for Environmental Educa-
tion and Research (SEER). 
Donahue succeeds David A. 
Dzombak, who left SEER to 
become head of the Depart-
ment of Civil and Environ-
mental Engineering.
Donahue is a professor of 
chemical engineering, chem-
istry, and engineering and 
public policy, and he is found-
ing director of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Center for Atmospheric 
Particle Studies.
“It’s a great opportunity 
to lead such a diverse and 
dynamic institute as envi-
ronmental issues continue 
to emerge. I look forward to 
having our research comple-
ment ongoing work at the 
newly created Scott Institute 
as we all strive to solve the 
environmental and energy 
issues of the 21st century,” 
Donahue said in a university 
press release.
Donahue has been at 
Carnegie Mellon for over a 
decade, ?rst joining the fac-
ulty in 2000. 
He has more than 150 
peer-reviewed publications; 
his research focuses on the 
behavior of organic com-
pounds in the atmosphere.
Mark Kamlet, Carnegie 
Mellon provost and execu-
tive vice president, is excited 
to see Donahue head SEER. 
“We look forward to having 
Neil as the new director to 
continue to help the Stein-
brenner Institute change the 
ways the world thinks and 
acts about the environment,” 
Kamlet said.

CMU English professor publishes book
Jon Klancher, a professor 
of English at Carnegie Mel-
lon and director of the liter-
ary and cultural studies pro-
gram, recently published a 
book titled Trans?guring the 
Arts and Sciences: Knowledge 
and Cultural Institutions in 
the Romantic Age.
Klancher’s book takes an 
interdisciplinary approach 
to looking at Romantic lit-
erary and critical writing to 
transformations in the his-
tory of science, history of the 
book, and art history.
“The new cultural insti-
tutions reached out to the 
public and engaged them in 
discussions about the ongo-
ing arts debates and scien-
ti?c controversies,” Klancher 
said in a university press re-
lease. “There were constant-
ly changing arguments about 
what the sciences are, where 
poetry ?ts in, how print me-
dia and the visual arts were 
transforming the shapes of 
public knowledge.’ ”
Klancher’s studies have 
focused on the Romantic 
and Victorian eras, history of 
books and reading, and the 
sociology of cultural ?elds. 
His previous book, The Mak-
ing of English Reading Au-
diences, 1790-1832, was a 
sketch of the Romantic era 
in England based on read-
ing patterns and relations of 
new reading audiences dur-
ing the time period.

fore the Senate body voted 
for their induction.
Two new Senators were 
inducted after this week’s

“People asked if we were tak-
ing donations or what the 
purpose of this was, but it’s 
all just to get people to think 
about the way we use urban 
space,” Abell said.
The project triggered con-
versations about the desire 
for more public space, the 
need for improved public 
transport to decrease traf-
?c and pollution, and rising 
prices in parking meters. The 
project also brought to light 
other urban issues and alter-
natives that many guests to 
the make shift parks admitted 
to never having considered 
before. “People asked us if 
we got any negative remarks, 
but we didn’t really; everyone 
was really positive and excit-
ed about the idea,” Abell said.
Abell and Winter gradu-

that other Carnegie Mellon

next year’s PARK(ing) Day

tion vision.
According to the press re-
lease, Tarr has been co-direct-
ing the Center for the Neural 
Basis of Cognition (CNBC) 
since 2009. The CNBC is a 
“joint center between CMU 
and the University of Pitts-
burgh devoted to investigat-
ing neural mechanisms and 
their impact on human cog-
nitive abilities,” according to 
the press release. His tenure 
at the center has been very 
successful — the press release 
notes the CNBC has been re-
sponsible for the hiring of 
?ve faculty members and has 
raised upwards of $5 million 
in funding.
Tarr also co-founded a 
startup company, Neon, in 
2012. According to the com-
pany’s website, Neon creates 
accurate video thumbnails 
by using models of “how the 
brain perceives images and 
can predict which ones people 
will prefer.”
“Michael Tarr is an out-
standing scientist who has 
spent the past four years ad-
vancing Carnegie Mellon’s 
impact on the brain and be-
havioral sciences,” John Le-
hoczky, dean of the Dietrich 
College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences, said in the 
press release.
Carnegie Mellon’s psychol-
ogy department boasts 30 
core faculty members, several 
research centers, and a child-
hood education center with a 
preschool and kindergarten.
Tarr feels very fortunate 
to be leading an already suc-
cessful department, rather 
than a department in need of 
reform. 
Tarr noted in an interview 
that the psychology depart-
ment at Carnegie Mellon is 
“one of the top-rated depart-
ments in the world,” and he 
hopes to “maintain that qual-
ity” and create new partner-
ships within Carnegie Mellon 
and its colleges, and particu-
larly with the School of Com-
puter Science.
While maintaining the 
quality, research-intensive 
program that the program 
boasts, Tarr hopes to move 
the department into new ar-
eas when appropriate. “It’s a 
wonderful department. I’m 
really pleased, and [I am] in a 
lucky position,” he said.

From his position as a 
self-employed student, and 
his newfound perspective as 
a CEO, Rosa offered advice 
speci?c to job fairs and the re-
cruitment process.
“You are at Carnegie Mel-
lon, and that’s why we are 
here. We know you are ?ne. 
What we really need to know 
is ‘Do you make me feel good 
having you around?’ ”
Rosa recommended that 
students attending the TOC, 
BOC, or other job fairs break 
out of the traditional in-
terview structure and “get 
recruiters to talk about them-
selves.”
Perhaps the most striking 
advice Rosa offered was di-
rected toward presentation. 
Most students attending job 
fairs like the TOC and BOC 
aren’t yet employed, and it’s 
important to keep that in 
mind when applying for a po-
sition. 
“Be professional, but don’t 
be a professional. You’re not,” 
he said. 
“You are at 
Carnegie Mellon, 
and that’s why we 
are here. We know 
you are ?ne. What 
we really need 
to know is ‘Do 
you make me feel 
good having you 
around?’ ”

Recent alumni help students catch a steal with DormDeal
BROOKE KUEI
Assistant SciTech Editor
Have a textbook you want 
to sell? Furniture you want 
to get rid of? Tickets to a 
game or concert you can’t 
make anymore? One option 
is DormDeal, a new web app 
developed by a team of Carn-
egie Mellon alumni that al-
lows members of the campus 
community to buy or sell used 
goods in a safe environment.
The app was developed by 
Jonathan Bender and Nolan 
Carroll, both information sys-
tems students who graduated 
this past year; Collin Buchan, 
a ?fth-year electrical and com-
puter engineering master’s 
student; and Patrick Hogan, a 
recent mechanical engineer-
ing graduate. Bender current-
ly holds the position of CEO, 
Carroll is the web developer, 
Buchan is the Android devel-
oper, and Hogan is in charge 
of design.
The group members began 
as best friends who decided to 
enter the 2013 TartanHacks 
competition during their se-
nior year. “Nolan actually had 
the domain [dormdeal.com] 
since freshman year ... so we 
thought it would be a great 
idea to actually make it at the 
competition,” Bender said.
The team ended up win-
ning the “eBay Best of eCom-
merce Hack” award, which 
inspired the group to take the 
project further. “I don’t think 
any of us expected for it to take 
off as much as it did from Tar-
tanHacks,” Hogan said.
Despite having only been 
developed this past Janu-
ary, DormDeal already has 
over 1,200 users. Currently, 
the main universities that are 
parts of the system are Carn-
egie Mellon, the University of 
Pittsburgh, and Pennsylvania 
State University. The app aims 
to connect buyers and sellers 
in the same location.
“We operate under the as-
sumption that people have 
physical access to their uni-
versity and can make deals on 
their campus,” Buchan said. 
Bender added, “The way 
we view it is that if we’re right 
down the street from Pitt, why 
not walk 200 yards and get a 
textbook for $20 cheaper?”
A user must have a univer-
sity-associated email address 
in order to create an account.  
“This really helps ensure that 
layer of trust that the people 
you’re dealing with are mem-
bers of your community, and 
since they’re not anonymous, 
they will be held accountable 
for their actions,” Buchan ex-
plained. He also mentioned 
that in other used-goods mar-
kets, such as Craigslist, users 
will create more than one ac-
count to barter with sellers un-
fairly. On DormDeal, however, 
you can only sign up once.
Another feature of the app 
is that it is very image orient-
ed. “People like to know what 
they’re getting. Personally, I 
would never buy something 
on Craigslist unless I can see 
a picture of it,” Carroll said. 
Though it is not required for 
sellers to use pictures, there 
is a ?lter option to search only 
for products that come with 
pictures. Search results can 
also be narrowed to speci?c 
product categories, such as 
books, furniture, electronics, 
appliances, apparel, and tick-
ets.
Ticket sales have been very 
popular — particularly at 
colleges such as Penn State, 
which boasts a prominent 
sports culture. “One of the 
things we’re looking at, espe-
cially for ticket sales ... is being 
able to have it show the bids of 
other people so you can have a 
bidding war,” Bender said. 
While ticket sales may be 
popular at certain universities, 
DormDeal may discover other 
niches at different schools as it 
expands. “It’s tailored to each 
different college, to see what 
their community is like, and 
the things they’re looking to 
buy and sell,” Hogan said.
Some future directions 
that the team is taking include 
deals for housing, promotions 
in Pittsburgh, a ride-share pro-
gram, and developing an iOS 
app. DormDeal’s new hous-
ing section will allow students 
to contact members living in 
off-campus housing who are 
graduating or looking for new 
roommates, as well as allow 
people to be pulled into open 
slots in on-campus housing. 
“We’re looking to have that 
done in the next couple of 
months,” Bender said, “so that 
it will be ready before room 
draw happens.” 
The section on promo-
tions in Pittsburgh will allow 
restaurants and other local 
companies to offer student 
deals through DormDeal. Ride 
share will endeavor to connect 
students who want to carpool 
home for breaks or for other 
reasons.
“We really want this to be 
a service to students,” Bender 
said. “We want to make it 
something that is eventually 
the ?rst thing you think of 
when you think of selling your 
textbook because it’s easy and 
free to you.”

Whether studying for an 
upcoming exam, following a 
daily routine, or merely recog-
nizing day-to-day objects, ev-
eryone is dependent on their 
memory to complete even the 
simplest tasks. Despite the fact 
that memory is such an inte-
gral part of our lives, scientists 
are only just beginning to un-
derstand the complex science 
behind our ability to remem-
ber.
The concept of memory 
can be generally broken up 
into three main categories: en-
coding, storage, and retrieval. 
Encoding deals with convert-
ing perceptions into chemical 
signals; this begins with our 
senses. According to howstuff-
works.com, as our senses take 
in a variety of stimuli, the hip-
pocampus and the frontal cor-
tex — two parts of the brain 
— decide if the information 
is important enough to be re-
membered. If the information 
is deemed worthy, it is con-
verted into chemical signals 
that travel through nerve cells 
in our brains.
The main action of encod-
ing, however, occurs at syn-
apses, which are the spaces 
in between nerve cells. When 
chemical signals reach a syn-
apse, they ?re across the gap 
to the next nerve cell, which 
releases neurotransmitters 
that create a link between the 
two cells.
As information is processed 
in this manner, a network of 
links between nerve cells is 
created throughout the brain. 
This process records all senso-
ry perceptions including (but 
not limited to) visual, tactile, 
and emotional stimuli. The 
network constantly changes 
as more stimuli are encoded 
and is strengthened through 
repetition.
The second major aspect 
of memory, storage, is divided 
into sensory storage, short-
term storage, and long-term 
storage. Sensory storage is 
used only for the initial per-
ception of stimuli. Once the 
brain has decided that the 
information is worthy of be-
ing remembered, it is sent to 
either short-term or long-term 
storage. According to USA To-
day, short-term memory stor-
age can hold approximately 
seven items for about 30 sec-
onds. Anything past that is 
sent into long-term storage, 
where practically unlimited 
amounts of information can 
be stored inde?nitely.
New stimuli are often 
linked with previous signals 
that are kept in long-term 
storage, which explains why 
it is often easier for people to 
remember things that are re-
lated to prior knowledge. A 
simple example of this is the 
use of mnemonic devices. By 
relating new information to 
something that the brain is 
already familiar with — such 
as the alphabet — the brain 
is forced to use neuron paths 
that have already been solidi-
?ed by repetition. It then be-
comes much easier to remem-
ber new information.
The ?nal category is 
memory retrieval. In order 
to remember something, the 
encoded information is un-
consciously retrieved from the 
network of neurons present in 
the brain.
Dif?culty in remembering 
something can be caused by a 
defect in any one of the three 
areas of memory. The stimuli 
might have never been prop-
erly encoded. The brain could 
have failed to store the infor-
mation due to distractions 
or a glitch in short-term or 
long-term memory — or there 
could be a problem with the 
retrieval of the information. 
This last problem generally 
occurs when there is a discrep-
ancy between the prompt the 
brain is using to remember the 
signal and the original signal 
that was encoded, according 
to howstuffworks.com. 
Through encoding, stor-
age, and retrieval, humans are 
able to recognize everything 
from the time of day to com-
plex mathematics. This allows 
people to perceive, under-
stand, and respond to the va-
riety of stimuli we encounter 
every day.

Chemistry professor leads effort to ?ght water pollutants
ROHAN VARMA
Junior Staffwriter
“The world we are deliver-
ing to the next generation is 
utterly unsustainable.”
These are the words of pro-
fessor Terry Collins, senior 
member of the Institute for 
Green Science and honorary 
professor of green chemistry. 
In recent years, because of 
the exploitation of carbon-
emitting fossil fuels, the 
growing industrialization in 
developing countries, and the 
damaging treatment of the 
environment, green chemis-
try has emerged as a necessity 
for ensuring that our planet 
remains viable.
Green chemistry is the 
study and research of new 
methods and processes that 
limit the use of hazardous sub-
stances emitted into the envi-
ronment. This problem of an 
unsustainable future has been 
at the center of Collins’s career 
and at the center of the ?eld of 
green chemistry.
Collins has been one of 
the primary leaders of green 
chemistry. “My career started 
in 1980, and green chemistry 
didn’t come along till 1991. 
But the 11 years before green 
chemistry, I was doing green 
chemistry,” he said. In fact, 
as a result of Collins’s heavy 
investment in green chem-
istry even before its onset, 
Carnegie Mellon was the ?rst 
institution to offer classes on 
the ?eld.
While there are myriad 
pathways in the ?eld of green 
chemistry, Collins has his 
sights on designing a way to 
reduce water pollution. Cur-
rently, different molecules 
?ow into the water supply 
from medications, waste, pu-
ri?ers, and other hosts. Many 
of these molecules have det-
rimental effects on not only 
humans that drink the water, 
but also on the aquatic life that 
lives in the water. Collins’s lab 
focuses on endocrine disrup-
tors, which are some the most 
harmful toxins currently be-
ing excreted into the water 
supply.
The endocrine system 
controls the development of 
bodily functions, whether it 
be growth, tissue functions, 
reproductive functions, or me-
tabolism. Endocrine disrup-
tors are the most devastating 
toxins in water because if any 
stage of development is dis-
trubed, the organism could 
be permanently changed or 
mutated.
“The endocrine disruption 
problem is the reason that the 
chemical enterprise is cur-
rently unsustainable,” Collins 
warned. “If I can take some 
pressure off through the wa-
ter, then that is wonderfully 
rewarding, personally,” he 
said.
With this goal in mind, Col-
lins has spent the last 15-20 
years perfecting a method of 
removing these harmful toxins 
from the water. His invention, 
and the hallmark of his career, 
is the tetra-amido macrocyclic 
ligand (TAML) catalyst. Col-
lins and his lab engineered 
this catalyst to oxidize and 
destroy harmful toxins in the 
water. A unique property of 
this molecule is that very small 
amounts of it are able to target 
and destroy numerous kinds 
of harmful wastes.
“It’s essentially like put-
ting ?re with water; minus-
cule amounts of TAML oxidize 
toxins down and take them 
all out. That’s what you want; 
you want a generic blow torch 
that goes in and gets rid of all 
the toxins in the water,” Col-
lins said.
According to Collins, the 
oxidation properties of the 
man-made catalyst are actual-
ly working better than natural 
catalysts. “They are out-per-
forming the enzymes. We are 
able to put them in water with 
tiny amounts and they work,” 
he said.
Collins is working in con-
junction with other institu-
tions to start a company that 
will commercialize and utilize 
his catalyst to clean water in 
both Europe and the United 
States. However, one of the 
major concerns and points 
of further investigation, is 
whether or not the TAML cata-
lysts themselves are harmful 
to humans. Over the last de-
cade Collins has researched 
and documented the effects 
of his catalyst on organisms 
at unprecedented levels. The 
main goal of the research has 
been to prove that the TAML 
catalyst does not act as an en-
docrine disruptor.
“We are mapping the entire 
territory on how to design to 
not create an endocrine dis-
ruptor. We’ve done more than 
anyone has ever done. People 
just don’t do these studies,” he 
said. The lab has been working 
mainly with ?sh species to test 
the effects of TAML. While ?sh 
are a similar model to humans, 
the lab will do further research 
to con?rm that there are no 
side effects on mammals.
Abigail Burton is a senior 
in the chemistry department’s 
joint BS/MS program and a 
part of Collins’s lab. “I ?nd 
Professor Collins’s research 
interesting because it’s impor-
tant and currently relevant 
to the real world. It is inter-
esting academically because 
we do things that no one has 
ever done before, but it is also 
interesting because the prob-
lems our research solve are 
relevant to all life on our plan-
et,” she said.
The research being done on 
TAML catalysts has enabled us 
to envision new ways of main-
taining the ecosystems we oc-
cupy. With further successful 
testing, one day we might see 
the fruits of Collins’s career 
enriching the lives of millions 
around the world.

CMU startup expedites the process of converting apps
DESIREE XU
Business Manager
Due to compatibility dif-
ferences between smartphone 
platforms, apps for mobile 
devices can often only be de-
veloped for a single operating 
system. Researchers at Carn-
egie Mellon are working on 
ways to expedite the process 
of converting apps between 
operating systems through 
their startup and computer 
platform: Apportable.
Collin Jackson, an assis-
tant research professor at 
Carnegie Mellon CyLab and 
the Information Networking 
Institute (INI) on the Silicon 
Valley campus (CMU-SV), 
developed the idea with co-
founder Ian Fischer and Chin-
may Garde, a graduate stu-
dent at CMU-SV. The startup, 
now located in downtown San 
Francisco, has grown in popu-
larity and translates apps 
from iOS to Android plat-
forms. “We solved a problem 
and helped developers so that 
they don’t have to individually 
deal with the hassle of always 
translating the coding for one 
device into another language,” 
Jackson said.
Jackson came up with the 
idea for the startup while 
looking up apps on an iPhone 
and realizing that they were 
not available for Android, 
the most commonly used 
mobile platform worldwide. 
He noticed that it could take 
developers a long time to re-
lease the Android version of 
some iOS apps due to tech-
nical barriers that hinder 
cross platform development. 
These technical barriers are 
a slow and expensive process 
to overcome because they re-
quire the developer to rewrite 
the app in a new language and 
maintain a second code base 
for the Android version. Ap-
portable helps make the pro-
cess of translating between 
platforms faster, cheaper, and 
easier, while maintaining the 
quality and functionality of 
the original app.
In the early days of Ap-
portable, Jackson and his 
team members developed a 
version of Objective-C, the 
language used to build iOS 
apps, that runs on Android 
phones. The team then devel-
oped prototype applications 
in iOS and ported them to 
Android using this technique. 
The prototypes were present-
ed to Google Ventures, the 
venture capital investment 
arm of Google Inc., in order 
to fundraise for the project. 
The funding was then used 
to recruit technical teams to 
develop Apportable, a com-
mercial product that grew to 
have 10s  of millions of users.
Currently, many game de-
velopers use Apportable and 
subsequently help promote 
Objective-C as the language 
for building apps across all 
platforms. Future directions 
for the company involve 
implementing the user inter-
face framework used by cer-
tain photo sharing and music 
apps, like Bjork’s Biophilia 
album for Android, which is 
the ?rst music app to be re-
leased for Android that was 
?rst written in Objective-C. 
The team is also helping non-
game developers launch apps 
for Android through Apport-
able by building Android de-
velopment tanks into their 
platform, allowing it to re-
ceive automatic support from 
a wide range of devices.
Making Apportable com-
patible with various devices 
was challenging. “Major chal-
lenges involved paying atten-
tion to a large number of little 
details to get Apportable to 
run perfectly,” Jackson said. 
In one particular example, 
“Apple developed an app that 
provided a ton of functional-
ity, but the team had to pro-
vide equivalent functionality 
for Android hardware that 
was not designed to run iOS 
code, which required a lot of 
time,” he added.
Although much of their 
work focuses on converting 
apps for Android, Apportable 
is aimed at letting customers 
translate apps between differ-
ent programming languages. 
The team’s favorite part of the 
startup? According to Jack-
son, it’s simply helping people 
overcome a time-consuming 
hindrance.

3-D printed objects may help blind use Internet
Blind children in Japan 
can now feel the results of 
their latest web search. Hands 
On Search, sponsored by Ya-
hoo! Japan, is a project aimed 
at making Internet search re-
sults tactile, rather than just 
visual and auditory.
The Special Needs Educa-
tion School for the Visually 
Impaired, af?liated with the 
University of Tsukuba, To-
kyo, has a custom-made 3-D 
printer which looks like a big 
puffy cloud. When kids ask 
the machine for things, it pro-
cesses the request using voice 
recognition, searches for the 
relevant 3-D data and prints 
out the object.

Breakthrough in Alzheimer’s diagnosis
Researchers have devel-
oped a way to illuminate a key 
protein associated with Al-
zheimer’s. Until very recently, 
all research on Alzheimer’s 
was based on detecting 
amyloid, a sticky substance 
that develops in the brain 
of people suffering from Al-
zheimer’s. However, another 
protein called tau, also asso-
ciated with Alzheimer’s, piles 
up in the brain in the form of 
harmful tangles.
Researchers at  National 
Institute of Radiological Sci-
ences in Japan, have discov-
ered that a class of molecules 
can latch onto tau tangles and 
help illuminate them during 
PET scans.

iPhone 5S raises privacy and security concerns
One of the highlights of 
Apple’s newly released iPhone 
5S is a ?ngerprint scanner to 
unlock the phone. This does 
away with the need for a pass-
code, making the phone much 
more secure against theft and 
misuse.
However, concerns have 
been raised about the collec-
tion of sensitive personal data 
like ?ngerprints. In addition 
to a possible privacy concern, 
it’s a potential security hazard 
as well; If one’s ?ngerprints 
fall into the wrong hands, 
hackers can impersonate him 
or her for the rest of their life, 
as they are inalterable.

Vitamin E ?ghts static electricity
It has been found that Vi-
tamin E can get rid of static 
electricity. Static electricity, 
known for the tiny jolts that 
one gets while walking bare-
foot on a carpet, can cause 
shocks that spark ?res and ex-
plosions in electronics. 
When surfaces rub against 
each other, uncharged mol-
ecules called free radicals 
are generated in addition to 
the static electric charges. 
Researchers at Northwestern 
University have shown that 
these radicals help stabilize 
the charges that develop. Vi-
tamin E is a radical scavenger, 
which absorbs these radicals. 
Thus, when the objects are 
dipped in a Vitamin E solu-
tion, the charges are desta-
bilized and static electricity 
cannot be generated.

Yeast strain can endlessly rejuvenate
Scientists at the Max 
Planck Institute of Molecu-
lar Cell Biology and Genetics 
have found that a certain type 
of yeast can stay young forev-
er by rejuvenating every time 
it reproduces.
In general, microbes re-
produce by splitting into two 
halves and dividing the cell 
material between the two 
halves. In most cases, one of 
the halves gets all the new 
material and the other gets 
all the old and damaged ma-
terial. 
In one yeast type, however, 
when the cell splits, an equal 
amount of old and new mate-
rial goes into both the resul-
tant halves. As both cells get 
only half the damaged materi-
al, the resultant cells are both 
appear younger than before.

New ?ndings support the 
hypothesis that life on Earth 
arose from the wreckage of 
comet collisions. Experiments 
have found that when a steel 
projectile is collided with a 
comet-like concoction, amino 
acids are produced. Amino ac-
ids are the building blocks for 
proteins, which are the key 
molecules for life. It is pos-
sible energy from the impact 
of the comets with the earth 
may have catalyzed the trans-
formation of simple carbon 
compounds into amino acids.
This is an alternative to the 
traditional hypothesis that life 
arose on earth from combina-
tion of chemicals that existed 
in the earth’s atmosphere and 
deep-sea vents.

Improve alcohol education, not crackdown
The Pennsylvania Liquor Control 
Board is spending $70,000 to cut 
down on underage drinking in Oak-
land, Squirrel Hill’s Rep. Dan Fran-
kel told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
The money was split into two grants, 
with $40,000 going to the Oakland 
Planning and Development Corpora-
tion, and the remaining $30,000 go-
ing to Carnegie Mellon’s University 
Police.
The allocation for the Oakland 
Planning and Development Corpora-
tion will be used to hire off-duty po-
lice of?cers to crack down on alcohol-
related crimes and code violations. 
They will gather data on drinking to 
target outreach programs with land-
lords and students. The executive 
director of the corporation, Wanda 
Wilson, said that she will crack down 
on pay-to-enter house parties, which 
promote dangerous drinking. Uni-
versity Police will use its share to 
provide additional training for of?-
cers, and pay for increased underage 
drinking patrols.
Underage drinking is a concern 
at Carnegie Mellon, as it is at every 
institution of higher learning, but a 
focus on catching students seems to 
miss the point. While breaking up 
large house parties to reduce high-
risk drinking is worthwhile, spend-
ing more money on catching stu-
dents is unlikely to deter them from 
drinking in signi?cant ways.
The money might be better spent 
educating students about alcohol in 
more effective ways, and giving them 
better risk assessment tools for the 
still-likely event that they drink. On-
line alcohol education is the punch-
line of many jokes on campus, and 
for good reason. Every year students 
?nd ways to skip the inconceivably 
outdated videos. The quizzes are no 
real guarantee of understanding and 
students have little motivation to do 
the program — even less to invest in 
how they do it. 
Providing more engaged learn-
ing may deter drinking more than 
crackdowns would. More hands-on 
learning, possibly through a single 
weekend class, could give students 
more motivation to digest the mate-
rial presented to them traditionally 
through online programs.
Carnegie Mellon’s University Po-
lice and the Oakland Planning and 
Development Corporation should 
not waste money working to reduce 
drinking signi?cantly; students will 
continue to drink, and may resort to 
more risky drinking in less suitable 
locations than houses, in response 
to crackdowns. Risky drinking could 
be made riskier in unsafe locations. 
Instead, the grants should go to-
ward helping students drink more 
responsibly.
Net?ix’s piracy battle bene?ts subscribers
Recently, Net?ix revealed that it 
adds movies and television shows 
to its catalog based on which media 
people most often stream or down-
load from piracy websites, according 
to BBC News.
This move by Net?ix obviously 
bene?ts the company and producers 
— they gain revenue and customers 
that they would otherwise lose to pi-
racy sites — but it also bene?ts view-
ers, particularly college students. 
Piracy can be more effectively com-
batted if major streaming services 
work toward the same goal.
While there is debate over wheth-
er piracy helps or hurts viewership, 
Net?ix ensures that viewers already 
paying for their subscription service 
do not resort to illegal (and often un-
reliable) websites with pop-up adver-
tisements or computer virus threats, 
such as The Pirate Bay. On these 
sites, users have to sort through links 
for what they deem to be the most 
reliable third-party hosts. In contrast 
to these sites, Net?ix provides us-
ers with a reliable hub of television 
shows and movies for a relatively low 
monthly price — $7.99.
For college students, this budget-
friendly subscription is a viable and 
welcome alternative to piracy sites. 
The subscription costs less than $100 
each year. However, a paid subscrip-
tion often cannot compete with the 
free option, despite any risks associ-
ated with it.
Regardless, Net?ix rewards cus-
tomers by providing them with want-
ed content. Some users may still use 
piracy sites to ?nd content that Net-
?ix does not carry, but the service is 
aiming to reduce visits to these sites 
by anticipating and researching 
what their users want. Other video 
streaming services, like Hulu and 
Amazon Instant Video, could ben-
e?t their customers by doing similar 
research. By combining forces to en-
sure that popular television shows 
and movies are available to the larg-
est audience possible, these services 
should decrease visits to piracy sites.
According to The Guardian, Kevin 
Spacey — star of the Net?ix original 
series House of Cards — said during 
the Edinburgh Television Festival, 
“The audience wants control. They 
want freedom. If they want to binge 
... then we should let them binge.”
The iTunes store has thrived off 
the concept of giving users easy ac-
cess to content when they want it. 
Apple stocks its library full with 
movies and music that are accessible 
on various platforms. By researching 
which television shows and movies 
are most often pirated, streaming 
services like Net?ix give users simi-
lar control to binge on the content 
they want.
Carnegie Mellon held its annual 
Technical Opportunities Conference 
(TOC) and Business Opportunities 
Conference (BOC) last week, where 
students dressed professionally and 
perfected their résumés in search of 
employment or summer internships 
from about 300 recruiters.
There’s no denying that the TOC 
and BOC are invaluable resources for 
Carnegie Mellon students, and ones 
that the student body may often take 
for granted — but the timing of these 
events limits job and internship op-
portunities for some students due to 
con?icting academic schedules.
The TOC and BOC are held from 
10:30 a.m.–5 p.m. on their sched-
uled days — Tuesday and Wednes-
day for the TOC and Thursday for 
the BOC. For students who have days 
?lled with classes, ?nding time to 
search for an internship or employ-
ment opportunity at these confer-
ences is problematic. Students may 
have to rush to the University Center 
during a short break between their 
classes, sometimes foregoing their 
lunch to do so. They might even miss 
class to attend these events.
Academic schedules should not 
limit the opportunities students have 
to obtain jobs or internships during 
the TOC and BOC.
Professors should strive to be-
come more understanding of poten-
tial con?icts with the TOC and BOC, 
and permit students to miss class for 
the conferences, or at the very least 
not schedule exams on the same day 
as one of these events. 
Alternatively, it may be possible 
to change the times during which 
the TOC and BOC are held. Recruit-
ers often stay overnight for the job 
fairs, so it is worth exploring the 
option of holding these events after 
standard class hours — perhaps from 
4–8 p.m. With times in the evening, a 
far greater number of students may 
have the opportunity to attend these 
important events without rushing 
through them.
The TOC and BOC are great op-
portunities that bene?t Carnegie 
Mellon students. However, to curb 
people from missing classes or re-
cruitment events, professors must 
either adapt their courses to allow 
students to miss classes on these 
days, or the university should work 
to move the TOC and BOC to more 
accessible hours.
BOC, TOC must be accessible to students
Indian chief minister may be damaging for country
CHLOE THOMPSON
The Bharatiya Janata Party an-
nounced last week that Narendra 
Modi would be its candidate for 
prime minister of India in the up-
coming 2014 elections, according 
to The New York Times. Modi is the 
current chief minister of Gujarat, a 
western state of India, and one of 
the most controversial politicians 
in India today. Modi has supervised 
the improvement of Gujarat’s econ-
omy in the last decade, and wants 
to encourage Hindus to vote as a re-
ligious bloc, rather than be divided 
by caste. Caste division in India is 
analogous to racism in the United 
States, so subverting these divides 
would be a great step forward for 
India. However, Modi is also a Hin-
du radical who has been accused of 
encouraging the anti-Muslim riots 
that swept Gujarat in 2002. Because 
Muslims constitute roughly 13 per-
cent of India’s population, having a 
prime minister with such virulent 
anti-Muslim sentiments will seri-
ously damage the unity of India.
Back in 2002, anti-Muslim riots 
broke out barely a year into Modi’s 
ministership of Gujarat, in response 
to the deaths of 60 Hindus in a train 
?re, according to BBC News. Over 
a thousand people — 800 Mus-
lims and 250 Hindus — died in the 
chaos. Citizens have gone so far as 
to accuse Modi not only of negli-
gence, but of purposefully allowing 
the riots to continue. He was never 
charged, but several of his associates 
were convicted of inciting a riot.
These events took place, for the 
most part, over a decade ago, but 
many Indian Muslims still hate Modi 
with passion. This hatred intensi-
?ed as more riots broke out in Uttar 
Pradesh last week after legislators 
from Modi’s party released a falsi-
?ed video of Hindus being lynched 
by a Muslim mob, according to The 
New York Times. During the riots, 
44 people died, and 42,000 people 
were displaced from their homes.
Despite the darker aspects of 
Modi’s political history, he has had 
some undeniable successes. One of 
his most visible victories is the eco-
nomic strength of Gujarat today. Gu-
jarat, which accounts for 5 percent 
of India’s population, produces 22 
percent of its exports and 16 percent 
of its industrial products, according 
to The New York Times. According to 
the BBC, output from farms in Gu-
jarat is nearly seven times the aver-
age in all of India, and its growth 
rate has remained in double digits 
for the past decade. While eco-
nomic prosperity is a complex and 
multi-layered phenomenon, Guja-
rat’s fortune looks good for Modi’s 
campaign, especially when the Indi-
an economy is looking shaky, accord-
ing to The New York Times. Further-
more, Modi’s constituency resides in 
Maninagar, which is one of the most 
well-run and orderly neighborhoods 
in India. It has round-the-clock en-
ergy, functional streets, and a work-
ing sewage system. Maninagar is a 
wonderful place to live — except for 
the few Muslim communities within 
the town. These successes do not 
outweigh Modi’s history, but they do 
give him the appearance of a leader 
who can ?x India’s ills.
Modi’s economic policy is not the 
only enticing aspect of his potential 
leadership. The minister wants to 
eliminate political barriers between 
castes as much as possible, creating 
a single Hindu voting bloc. One of 
the ways he plans on doing this is 
by focusing on young Hindu voters. 
In fact, he recently took to Twitter 
to encourage voters between ages 
18 and 24 to register to vote, ac-
cording to The Economic Times. For 
young people, Modi is a dynamic, 
impassioned leader who has the po-
tential to both improve the economy 
and minimize caste divisions. Modi 
is even more appealing when com-
pared to aging leaders of other par-
ties, or to Prime Minister Manmo-
han Singh, who is 80 years old.
For a young Indian person, Mo-
di’s message is incredibly appealing. 
He offers economic and political sta-
bility on a platter, and both of these 
things would make life easier in In-
dia. However, Modi is also danger-
ous because his message of unity is 
subtly tied to the discrimination of 
Muslim Indians. India, like America, 
is drifting toward being more po-
litically polarized every day. While 
Hindus represent 80 percent of the 
Indian electorate, they have never 
bonded to form a political bloc be-
cause of caste divisions. If Modi can 
mobilize Hindus to act as a politi-
cal unit, which he has the potential 
to do — especially with the lure of 
dynamic change and improved eco-
nomic policy — they could very eas-
ily control Indian politics. 
This cooperation would not be a 
bad thing. In fact, having India move 
past caste divisions would be a great 
cultural and political boon for the 
nation. If this cooperation is linked 
to anti-Muslim sentiment, however, 
it would eventually cause division 
among all Indians.

Cyrus deserves a break, 
Thicke deserves a stake
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
Junior Staffwriter
To appreciate the disturbing gen-
der divide in popular media, one 
only has to take a hard look at two of 
the most talked-about artists in re-
cent months. Robin Thicke, the man 
behind “Blurred Lines,” and Miley 
Cyrus, who made news last week 
with her hit “Wrecking Ball,” almost 
beg for a comparison.
At ?rst glance, the two artists 
seem radically different. Thicke is 
36 years old and married, with al-
most two decades of experience in 
the music industry. Cyrus is only 20, 
and a former Disney Channel star.
It is highly disconcerting, howev-
er, that there is such a large disparity 
between the widespread condemna-
tion of Cyrus and the comparatively 
minimal criticism of Robin Thicke 
for their work as artists, as well 
as their performance at the 2013 
VMAs. It takes two to tango, but 
the phrase does not seem to apply 
to their performances. Cyrus was 
practically burned at the stake, but 
Thicke’s only regret after grinding 
on a girl 16 years his junior may have 
been that she stole the spotlight.
Lately it appears Cyrus has been 
doing everything in her power to 
scrub away her persistent image 
as America’s sweetheart. Need-
less to say, Cryus’s decision to take 
a ride on construction equipment 
in “Wrecking Ball” and to “twerk it 
out” in her single “We Can’t Stop” 
has been controversial. As a result, 
the wholesome sweetness of Han-
nah Montana has been erased.
But perhaps that is the point. 
What right do people have to dictate 
the career choices of a performer in 
the midst of rede?ning herself? Hor-
ri?ed fans of a younger Cyrus would 
have her stay stagnant, crying foul at 
the shearing of her trademark wavy 
locks, and at her provocative ward-
robe. They throw around words like 
“slut,” “trashy,” and “pathetic.”
Such treatment is not only unre-
alistic, but grossly unfair. Many peo-
ple fail to recognize that the celebri-
ties they fall in love with are liable 
(and justi?ed) to change. In pushing 
boundaries, Cyrus is creating an un-
forgettable buzz, gathering a new 
fanbase, and establishing herself 
as a performer with staying power. 
Frankly, it does not matter if a mil-
lion people ?nd Cyrus’s clothing 
distasteful and her actions crude. 
She has the right as an artist to 
make choices about how she wants 
to be perceived, as well as a right as 
a woman to do with her body what 
she will.
While Cyrus has been criticized 
for her performance and rapidly 
changing image, Thicke has enjoyed 
resounding popularity for the bla-
tantly misogynistic “Blurred Lines.” 
The song hides behind a smooth 
beat and annoying catchiness, but 
the closer one looks, the less it 
sounds like sexy dance music and 
more like an endorsement for sexual 
assault. 
Lines like “I know you want it,” 
“I’m gonna take a good girl,” and “Do 
it like it hurt,” resemble classic justi-
?cation for sexual assault. Thicke’s 
song promotes the destructive idea 
that consent itself is a blurred line.
Nowhere is the contrast between 
Thicke and Cyrus more apparent 
than in the music videos for their 
latest respective hits. The uncen-
sored music video for “Blurred 
Lines” features Thicke fully dressed 
and in control as a trio of topless 
models clad only in nude G-strings 
strut around for his viewing plea-
sure. Cyrus similarly strips down 
in her “Wrecking Ball” video, but 
while Thicke and the models have 
taken relatively little abuse for their 
display, Cyrus has been mercilessly 
vili?ed for daring to show her body.
This huge difference in public re-
action is telling. Our media-saturat-
ed generation has become numb to 
Thicke’s brand of misogyny. Objecti-
?cation of women is nothing new to 
us. Cyrus’s exhibition in her “Wreck-
ing Ball” video is an instance not of 
a woman being sexualized by the 
media, but choosing to place herself 
in a position of sexual power. Maybe 
this choice is unusual enough that 
the public rejected it offhand.
Whatever the underlying cause 
behind Thicke’s praise and Cyrus’s 
criticism is, it might be useful to take 
away this: Knee-jerk reactions of-
ten deserve a second look. The next 
catchy song could glorify something 
terrible, and the next wild pop star 
could just be growing up.
Criticism of millennials holds true
XIYU WANG
Older generations seem to always 
complain about younger ones, and 
the present older generation bears 
no exception. 
It is not uncommon to ?nd edito-
rials or articles criticizing the millen-
nial generation — those born from 
the late 1980s to around 2000. A 
2008 op-ed in The Wall Street Jour-
nal, which refers to millennials as 
“trophy kids,” reports that many 
older managers view the millen-
nial generation as more entitled and 
high-maintenance than previous 
generations. An article published last 
May in Time magazine focuses on the 
narcissism of the “me me me genera-
tion.” There is an overall notion that 
millennials are more self-absorbed 
and entitled than those who came 
before them.
This criticism, while harsh, is al-
most certainly true. 
Although it varies from case to 
case, it seems like the number of 
self-absorbed people has never been 
greater. Everybody wants others to 
read their daily Facebook statuses, 
Tumblr posts, and Twitter feeds. 
Some people need to take photos 
of themselves and their dog twice 
a day. Instant grati?cation, unwar-
ranted self-importance, and ?rst-
world problems are abound.
This criticism is not just some 
anecdote-based gut feeling either. 
According to a study published in 
the American Psychological Associa-
tion that analyzed values of people 
ranging from 18–40 years old, the 
millennials view money, fame, and 
image as more important than self-
acceptance, af?liation, and commu-
nity; they also have less concern for 
others and lower civic engagement 
than previous generations.
Given the way millennials were 
raised — myself included — it is  
unsurprising that we turned out the 
way we did. For over a decade, we 
were told to expect more, want more, 
and feel better about ourselves.
Millennials were born in a time 
when it was good to be an American. 
The nation was strong and ?ourish-
ing. We watched the Soviet Union 
fracture and fall while the United 
States became the strongest, freest, 
and most developed nation in the 
world. The American dream was 
more than a dream; it was taken 
for granted that, by the age of 30, a 
hardworking individual could have 
a stable job, a suburban home, and 
two or three kids.
This feel-good era was rife with 
feel-good values. Much fuss has 
been made about the “every child 
gets a trophy” mentality in school 
activities, but it is really only part of 
the larger self-esteem movement. A 
plethora of Disney movies told mil-
lennials to never settle for anything 
less than our hearts’ desires. Books 
and television shows told us to cel-
ebrate individuality. Schools were 
plastered with motivational posters 
that told us to dream big, disregard 
the naysayers, and never conform.
Each generation’s values are di-
rectly in?uenced by the society they 
grew up in — and with the advent 
of smartphones and social media to 
serve as enablers of self-promotion, 
it may very well be that the values of 
this generation are here to stay. How-
ever, with the nation still mired in 
war, recession, and political con?ict, 
it is impossible to tell exactly what 
the next generation will be like. But 
the values of the millennial genera-
tion may constitute a new normal, 
and in time, people may have to re-
consider what it means to be “self-
absorbed.”

During the 2014 Miss America 
Pageant on Sept. 15, Nina Davu-
luri of Fayetteville, N.Y., became the 
?rst woman of Indian descent to be 
crowned Miss America. Following 
the announcement, riled pageant 
viewers unleashed a toxic deluge of 
racist and xenophobic tweets target-
ed at Davuluri’s win.
These tweets, some of which were 
complied on the popular website 
BuzzFeed, ranged from objections 
such as “I swear I’m not racist but 
this is America” to extremely offen-
sive personal attacks calling Davu-
luri “Miss 7-11,” “Miss Terrorist,” and 
“Miss Al-Qaeda.” One person laugh-
ably claimed, “we all know Obama 
bought that pageant!”
As goes without saying, such 
comments are indefensibly bigoted 
and hopelessly illogical. President 
Obama is about as likely to have 
done a deal with Miss America pag-
eant owner Donald Trump as Muslim 
extremists are likely to enter bikini-
clad catwalk competitions. In addi-
tion to these people’s obvious errors 
is their utter misunderstanding of 
American values. America is a nation 
of immigrants. 
Isn’t the idea of a great Ameri-
can melting pot among the ?rst of 
the values that patriots and pageant 
contestants should represent? Com-
prised of many races and unique eth-
nic groups, the American population 
ought to prize diversity as much as 
any other national value — and cer-
tainly shouldn’t be protesting it.
Yet despite the outrageous nature 
of these tweets, and despite reac-
tions to them ranging from righteous 
anger to mockery, one reaction has 
been almost nonexistent: surprise. 
Almost nobody, it seems, is in any 
way surprised by this gross display 
of racism; the incident has been de-
scribed as a “tired theme” by CNN.
This lack of shock is among the 
most troubling aspects of this story. 
Racism of this kind is apparently 
commonplace enough that it is un-
surprising even when it is written 
publicly with no concealment of 
identity. 
According to a World Values Sur-
vey published this year, the popula-
tion of America is among the least 
racist in the world, and yet Ameri-
cans are quite used to racism. The 
national struggle against bigotry is 
clearly too far from won.
Certainly, enormous progress 
has been made in American cul-
ture’s overall standing with diversity. 
From the civil rights movement of 
the 1960s to modern-day immigra-
tion reform, Americans as a whole 
increasingly accept diversity and 
condemn prejudice. This positive 
trend will hopefully and probably 
continue. However, the nation has a 
long way to go until racist vitriol of 
the sort exhibited following the Miss 
America pageant is rare enough to be 
anomalous — preferably shocking 
and wholly impermissible.

After a string of 1–0 vic-
tories, the men’s soccer team 
found the net more often this 
week starting with a 3–0 vic-
tory over Washington & Jeffer-
son College earlier on Wednes-
day. The Tartans ended the 
week pummeling the visiting 
Bethany College Bisons 5–0 on 
a rainy Saturday afternoon.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
?rst got on the scoreboard in 
the 19th minute when ?rst-
year Tristan Lockwood tapped 
in a well-placed ball from se-
nior defender Ben Bryant for 
his ?rst goal of the season. The 
play started off with a free kick 
by Bryant, who lobbed a pass 
near the right crossbar where 
it rebounded off a defender, 
meeting Lockwood who was 
right there to put in the goal.
Lockwood was very active 
in the ?rst half and had many 
quality breakaways on the 
sideline. One of them led to 
a goal by senior forward Max 
Tassano who had a brilliant 
low shot to the corner of the 
net in the 22nd minute.
The Tartans frenetic attack, 
consisting of several through 
balls and great ball control, 
led to another goal in a matter 
of ?ve minutes. This time, se-
nior Mike Ferraco’s cross-pass 
into the penalty box found a 
sliding Lockwood who scored 
his second goal to put the Tar-
tans up 3–0.
Near the end of a fabulous 
?rst half for the Tartans, Tas-
sano found the net again, this 
time with a header off senior 
Jerome Reano’s cross that 
sailed to the back post.
“It was de?nitely a con?-
dence booster for me to get 
two,” Tassano said. “I have 
been struggling recently with 
scoring.”
As it turned out, it was 
also a con?dence boost for 
the whole team, as the Tar-
tans emptied their bench in 
the second half. Senior Kevin 
Pierce had an easy goal into 
an empty net off a pass from 
Reano in the 60th minute. The 
Tartans continued their attack 
and had quality shots on goal.
“We made sure to be posi-
tive from the bench and make 
sure that we were cheering 
them on,” said senior Chris 
Wysocki, who was selected as 
the Division III Men’s Disney 
Soccer/NSCAA Player of the 
Week last Tuesday.
As impressive as the of-
fense was in scoring ?ve goals, 
the defense held its ground 
and allowed the Bisons to get 
only ?ve shots on goal. “Our 
defense has been stellar this 
year,” Tassano said. “It’s been 
huge for us because we know 
they are probably not going to 
score, and if we get one or two, 
we got the game.”
Overall, it was a perfect 
game for the Tartans both of-
fensively and defensively as 
they improved their record 
to 7–1. The Tartans will com-
pete next against Grove City 
this Saturday at 4:30 p.m. at 
home.

The Cleveland Browns 
have been the epitome of futil-
ity since they were refounded 
in 1999. The original Browns 
franchise moved to Baltimore 
in 1995, was renamed the Ra-
vens, and has since won two 
Super Bowls, further proving 
that Cleveland is where sports 
teams go to die.
After another disappoint-
ing season and a transfer of 
ownership to businessman 
Jim Haslett, the Browns re-
placed their entire manage-
ment, ?ring head coach 
Pat Shurmur and general 
manager Tom Heckert. Rod 
Chudzinski was hired to re-
place Shurmur and Michael 
Lombardi to replace Heckert.
The new management be-
gan the slow and arduous pro-
cess of bringing the Browns 
out of the gutter and back to 
the level of their AFC North 
brethren: the Baltimore Ra-
vens, the Pittsburgh Steelers, 
and the Cincinnati Bengals.
Normally, the standard 
ineptitude of the Browns 
isn’t headline news with the 
merry-go-round of head 
coaches, starting quarter-
backs, and exceptional teams. 
This time is different, howev-
er, as the Browns have made 
one of the most shocking 
trades in NFL history: trad-
ing running back Trent Rich-
ardson, the third overall pick 
in the 2012 NFL Draft, to the 
Indianapolis Colts for a 2014 
?rst-round pick.
The trade came as such a 
surprise that no one is quite 
sure who made the better 
deal, and more importantly, 
what in the world the new 
Browns management was 
thinking.
Richardson has been a po-
larizing player since his days 
at the University of Alabama. 
He ?rst made an impact as the 
backup to the 2009 Heisman 
Trophy winner and current 
New Orleans Saint Mark In-
gram. He then lead Alabama 
to a national championship in 
2011 as the feature back, be-
ing named an All-American 
and winning the Doak Walker 
award for best college run-
ning back.
In the 2012 draft, the top 
two players were clearly quar-
terbacks Andrew Luck and 
Robert Grif?n III. The Colts 
had the ?rst pick and drafted 
Luck, while the Washington 
Redskins traded up from the 
sixth pick to snatch Grif?n. 
The Browns were also inter-
ested in trading with the St. 
Louis Rams for the second 
overall pick but were out-
matched by the Redskins offer 
of three ?rst-round picks.
This left the Browns in an 
interesting spot, holding the 
fourth overall pick while the 
Minnesota Vikings sat in front 
of them with the third pick. 
The Browns decided to pass 
on quarterback Ryan Tan-
nehill who fell to the Miami 
Dolphins at No. 8, and in-
stead made the curious move 
to trade up one spot with the 
Vikings. The Browns then 
?lled their quarterback need 
by taking Brandon Weeden, 
the oldest-ever player taken 
in the ?rst round, with their 
28th pick.
Which brings us to the 
present day. Normally, moves 
such as bailing on the third 
overall pick after only 18 
games are reserved for coach-
es and general managers who 
know their days are num-
bered. But in this case, it ap-
pears that Cleveland’s front 
of?ce is taking the exact op-
posite approach, looking to 
the long term.
To return to relevancy, 
the Browns need a franchise 
quarterback. The Weeden ex-
periment has failed; its failure 
is further pronounced when 
the other quarterbacks of 
Weeden’s draft class — Luck, 
Grif?n, Tannehill, and third-
round pick Russell Wilson — 
have established themselves 
as franchise cornerstones.
This upcoming draft is 
likely to be full of NFL-cali-
ber quarterbacks with Teddy 
Bridgewater and Heisman 
Trophy-winner Johnny Man-
ziel leading the way. The 
trade appears to be setting the 
stage for the Browns to pick 
any incoming quarterback 
and make the necessary trade 
to get him with multiple ?rst-
round picks in their arsenal.
For the Colts, this is an 
interesting move. Rarely do 
teams get the chance to bring 
in a potential Pro Bowl talent 
for only a ?rst-round pick. 
The Colts gave up a chance 
to draft a great player for one 
they believe is already proven. 
But history will tell whether 
or not Richardson becomes a 
Hall of Famer, or another in 
the long line of running back 
busts who can’t last more 
than a few years, given the 
wear and tear they receive on 
a weekly basis.
If Richardson can help 
protect Luck from blitzing 
linebackers making the Colts 
offensive line look like Swiss 
cheese, and if the Colts can 
rebound from a tough 1–1 
start to make the playoffs, the 
move will be considered ge-
nius. In addition, if the Colts’ 
legitimate passing threat 
forces teams to stop crowding 
the line of scrimmage against 
Richardson — thus making 
his pedestrian yards-per-car-
ry rise to the level of a great 
player — the Browns will 
have added another item to 
their long list of poor moves.
The two teams are clearly 
heading in opposite direc-
tions, with the Browns look-
ing toward the future and the 
Colts making it clear that they 
aim to win now. Let’s see how 
both teams fare in a year or 
two after all of the pieces have 
fallen into place.
SPORTS COMMENTARYWhat are the Browns doing?Women’s soccer continues dominance in 2–0 victory
WILLIAM PARK
Assistant Forum Editor
The women’s soccer team 
continued its streak of domi-
nance last Friday, beating the 
La Roche College Redhawks 
at home 2–0 in convincing 
fashion.
The win — their fourth in 
a row — improves their re-
cord to 5–1–1.
The Tartans started scor-
ing in the 10th minute when 
senior defender Rachel Con-
topoulos curved a corner kick 
into the top right corner of 
the net for her ?rst goal of the 
season.
The Tartans cruised for the 
rest of the game, controlling 
possession in La Roche ter-
ritory while pressuring the 
Redhawks into turnovers in 
the rare instances where they 
had the ball
The Redhawks’ only shot 
of the game came in the 18th 
minute and harmlessly soared 
over the net. The Tartans end-
ed the game with 24 shots. 
Sophomore Louisa Pend-
ergast scored her second goal 
of the season in the 57th min-
ute.
“We switched our position-
ing — instead of having two 
center-mid[?elders], we had 
two attacking mid[?elders],” 
she said.
Sophomore Amanda Brod-
erick advanced the ball to 
outside the penalty box and 
found Pendergast on her 
left, who struck the ball with 
her left foot past the goalie’s 
stretched arm.
“No one was defending 
me. It was an easy shot,” she 
said.
For the Redhawks, the 
game was one long, self-tor-
menting cycle. With the Tar-
tans keeping possession in the 
La Roche half, the Redhawks 
took many goal kicks. Unfor-
tunately for them, their goal 
kicks bounced back to Carn-
egie Mellon players, which 
allowed the Tartans to restart 
their attack in great position.
“They dropped off a lot 
of defensive players,” Pend-
ergast said, which allowed 
them to win the opposing goal 
kicks. “And they were short.”
Over their four-game win-
ning streak, the Tartans have 
outshot their opponents 60–
14.
Despite their recent suc-
cess, Pendergast says there is 
still room for improvement. 
“I think we have a lot to work 
on,” she said. “The progres-
sion has been going well, but 
we really need to start putting 
teams away.”
“Once we touch up our 
attacking third, I think we’ll 
have a solid season,” she said.
On Friday, the Tartans had 
an opportunity to increase 
their lead in the 30th minute. 
Junior Lucy Havens — taking 
a penalty kick after sopho-
more Carson Quiros was 
taken down in the box — shot 
right into the diving goalie’s 
hand.
In the ?rst half, ?rst-year 
forward Megan Bartoshuk 
caused havoc on the left ?ank, 
creating chances for her team-
mates by advancing the ball to 
the goal line and crossing the 
ball into the penalty box. 
In the eighth minute, she 
created a chance of her own 
as she beat her defender and 
drove a shot that clanged off 
the crossbar.
The Tartans will play 
Wednesday at home at 7 p.m. 
against Juniata College.

After suffering a season-
ending injury last year, junior 
William Duncan is excited to 
be back on the court as part of 
the men’s tennis team.
“It was miserable not being 
able to play,” Duncan said.
During his ?rst year, he 
started experiencing extreme 
pain in his shoulder, especially 
when serving. After a visit to 
the doctor, he discovered that 
he had a SLAP tear. Deciding 
to get the necessary surgery 
was dif?cult, but Duncan per-
severed through a year with-
out tennis.
“I am still trying to get back 
to where I was,” Duncan said. 
Though he doesn’t claim to 
be back to 100 percent, the 
results suggest he is getting 
close.
After ?ve matches, Duncan 
remains undefeated. Duncan 
was also named the Univer-
sity Athletic Association Men’s 
Tennis Athlete of the Week 
Sept. 1–7.
The team — which has a 
short fall season — will com-
pete next in the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Association (ITA) Re-
gional Tournament in Fred-
ericksburg, Va. this weekend. 
The winner of the tournament 
will play in the ITA National 
Small College Championships 
in Florida.
Although the team has 
fallen short of making the na-
tional tournament in the past, 
Duncan believes that this year 
the goal is within reach.
“We have high expecta-
tions. We expect to make the 
NCAA,” Duncan said. If they 
do, Duncan will be a big rea-
son why.
“[His] desire and heart has 
always been unquestionable; 
[they] are something any fam-
ily would love to have on their 
team,” said his doubles part-
ner, junior Christian Heaney-
Secord.
Duncan is a computation-
al and applied mathematics 
major looking to double ma-
jor in computational biology 
and hoping to go to graduate 
school for bioinformatics.
Having to manage one’s 
time while playing a varsity 
sport can be dif?cult, but Dun-
can is able to manage his time 
well. “I don’t feel like it gets 
in the way [of school] at all,” 
Duncan said. “It’s like anyone 
else — you have busy weeks 
and weeks that aren’t as busy.”
Having started playing ten-
nis at the age of 6, Duncan has 
grown through tennis both as 
a player and as a person.
When asked what his favor-
ite part about tennis was, Dun-
can excitedly mentioned the 
competition. “When you win, 
it’s like you’re better than the 
other player and you’re just 
proving that,” he said with a 
light in his eyes.
Winning, however, isn’t ev-
erything to Duncan; using his 
entire potential is much more 
important. After every match, 
Duncan wants to feel he 
played his best even if he loses.
While tennis is largely an 
individual sport, Duncan also 
embraces playing as part of a 
team.
“Everyone cares, everyone 
wants to win, [and] everyone 
is working really hard to get 
better. And it’s good to be in 
that kind of environment; you 
can push each other,” he said.
His teammates are also 
glad Duncan is returning to 
the courts.
“Willy Dunks is quite pos-
sibly the hardest working and 
most dedicated person I have 
ever met,” Heaney-Secord 
said.
As a team member, Duncan 
also plays an important lead-
ership role.
One of his newest team-
mates, ?rst-year Kenny Zheng, 
has found Duncan to be some-
one he can look up to. “[His] 
work ethic and determination 
make him a great role mod-
el for the rest of the team,” 
Zheng said.
After he ?nishes college, 
Duncan hopes to continue 
playing tennis competitively, 
though he recognizes that it 
may not be as accessible. Until 
then, Duncan will try to make 
the most of his time at Carn-
egie Mellon.

Olsen plays at the Warhol
Promising singer-songwriter to perform in Pittsburgh
Angel Olsen is the kind of singer-songwriter 
that belongs to an older time — a time before 
computers, when all music was made using purely 
natural sounds. Raw talent and emotion shimmers 
throughout her work, both in terms of her beautiful 
singing as well as her lyrics. Olsen will be performing 
tomorrow at the Andy Warhol Museum on the North 
Shore.
Chicago native Olsen first made her name known in 
2011 with the release of Strange Cacti. Since then, 
she has been garnering acclaim everywhere she 
goes. Half Way Home, released last September, was 
met with critical praise from the likes of Pitchfork.
com and Allmusic.com. Half Way Home is built upon 
the sound of its predecessor, adding more country-
like arrangements and at times a fuller instrumental 
sound.
Olsen’s music is heavily folk and country inspired, 
which makes every song sound a little familiar even 
if you’ve never heard it before. She generally uses 
just her voice with soft acoustic or electric guitar 
accompaniment, which is no problem because 
her voice is truly the crux of her talent. Within a 
single song she can go from a soft whisper to a full, 
yodeling sound that gives many tracks a large range.
Her recent single “Sweet Dreams” features a full 
band, forcing Olsen to prove just exactly who the 
star of the show is. Her lyrics, while not of the same 
caliber as her musical skills, offer insights into 
topics such as death, falling in and out of love, and 
loneliness. “Acrobat” touches on the longing to be 
connected to another in every single way including 
the finality of death.
“Miranda” shows her taking on the role of a police 
officer reading a lying lover his or her rights before 
questioning. While not every song touches on such 
bleak subject matter, the overall mood of her music is 
despondent. Despite the sad words, however, on the 
whole the songs come off as more comforting than 
depressing, following the construct of her country 
and folk influences.
If previous performances accurately predict, Olsen’s 
upcoming show at the Andy Warhol Museum 
should be an intimate and engaging affair. Olsen’s 
is definitely a name to watch; she is one of those 
singer-songwriters who can truly bring it all to the 
table, and these days that’s an increasingly rare 
commodity. Next time you’re alone but don’t feel like 
going out, I recommend looking to her for company.

Kanye West, Lady Gaga, and Wes Anderson rarely make 
it into academia as subjects of study, and they’re even 
less frequently cited in this sense as renowned theorists 
like Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, and Emma Goldman. 
But a combination of pop culture and high-brow 
intellectualism was precisely what queer theorist Jack 
Halberstam brought to Carnegie Mellon in his Thursday 
lecture. The lecture — sponsored by the Center for Arts 
in Society, the English department, and Trans-Q TV — 
was titled “No Church in the Wild: Queer Anarchy & 
the Aesthetics of Chaos” and focused on a discussion 
of queerness and anarchy through the lens of popular 
culture.
Halberstam is currently a professor of English and 
the director of the Center for Feminist Research at 
the University of Southern California. He is a gender 
and queer theorist, and his books cover topics like 
female masculinity, critiques of heteronormativity and 
capitalism, and popular culture. His most recent book, 
2012’s Gaga Feminism: Sex, Gender, and the End of 
Normal, looks at the signi?cance of Lady Gaga’s fame — 
what she symbolizes and why it matters — and results 
in a manifesto of sorts, calling for a new type of feminism 
that encourages creative chaos and ?uidity.
Halberstam’s talk on Thursday was focused on ideas 
of “the Wild” and queer anarchy: what they are, where 
we see them, and what they could mean for the future. 
Halberstam de?ned anarchy as a new form of opposition 
to the state and to institutionality in general and drew 
on political movements like Occupy to demonstrate that 
“people are turning now to political projects of anarchy.” 
The talk was extremely accessible even to those without 
a background in queer or political theory. Halberstam 
relied on popular culture reference points to guide his 
talk.
According to Halberstam, the current movement toward 
anarchy is all about disrupting the system and calling 
into question all of the social norms that we take for 
granted. The majority of the talk focused on where 
we see these ideas in popular culture, including Wes 
Anderson’s 2009 ?lm The Fantastic Mr. Fox and Jay-Z 
and Kanye West’s Watch the Throne. “Art is a special 
place for experiments with anarchy,” Halberstam said, 
noting that in art, there’s less concern for practical 
consequences.
Fantastic Mr. Fox is a story about a fox that steals 
chickens from wealthy farmers every night until the 
farmers catch on and try to kill him. The fox and his 
family retaliate, outwitting the farmers and creating new 
homes underground. According to Halberstam, this ?lm 
can be interpreted as a radical tale of queer anarchist 
disruption. The foxes literally go underground to escape 
the farmers, but this could be viewed as them creating a 
subculture that rejects capitalism and traditional ideas of 
male heroism.
Halberstam also discussed Jay-Z and Kanye West’s 
hit song “No Church in the Wild,” from their hit album 
Watch the Throne. The song embodies many major 
themes of the album as a whole: fame, wealth, power, 
and the challenges of these successes. R&B singer Frank 
Ocean — who happens to be gay, a point Halberstam 
?nds worth noting — sings the refrain on the song: 
“Human beings in a mob./What’s a mob to a king?/
What’s a king to a god?/What’s a god to a non-believer?/
Who don’t believe in anything?”
“I hear anarchy in that lyric,” Halberstam said, 
discussing the dif?culty of “non-believing” in a world 
where theology and existing power structures rule. 
Halberstam believes in the power of people to change 
society through solidarity with others who want the 
same things. By subverting the power of markets and 
the average person’s status as a mindless consumer, 
Halberstam believes we can be heroes like the 
protagonists of The Fantastic Mr. Fox and create actual, 
productive change.
Halberstam closed his talk with a discussion of drag 
culture and a few queer artists who continue to push the 
limits of art and disruption, before opening the ?oor to 
questions.
“I’m not convinced that anarchy is even supposed to 
be laid out in terms of a political regime,” Halberstam 
said, in response to an audience question about how 
anarchy can be understood through the most recent 
Batman movie. He emphasized his point that the 
anarchy he sees is more a means of disruption to our 
typical ways of thinking. “We’re not really debating new 
forms of subculture, but we are turning to anarchy to ask 
questions,” he said.
Attendees were left with a lot to think about, from how 
we interpret popular culture to what questions we ask 
about political structures. Halberstam acknowledged 
that he, too, still has questions, and that that’s okay: “I’m 
happy to sit with some of this material and not know.”

The Idiot Box inspires laughter and thought
Carnegie Mellon production touches on the modern American life through our love of television
Once the canned laughter ?lling in all the funny (and not-
so-funny) jokes disappeared from the background noise 
of The Idiot Box, something clicked. The play, originally 
by playwright and screenwriter Michael Elynow, 
produced a revelation among audience members. Amid 
the pregnant pause of expectance, both the characters 
and the audience realized that the “reality” in which they 
had existed was simply a carefully crafted, false universe 
and that it was time to face the terrifying real world. 
That poignant moment of silence perfectly encapsulated 
the message behind The Idiot Box.
The production, which ran Monday through Saturday 
in the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre of the Purnell 
Center, was co-directed by junior directing major Alex 
Tobey and Pittsburgh guest director Tami Dixon as a 
part of the Junior Performance Projects series. According 
to the show note, written by sophomore dramaturgy 
major Holly Dennis, The Idiot Box is meant to examine 
reality in a modern context — and what better way to do 
that than through America’s obsession with TV?
The show is centered on the cast of a sitcom called Pals, 
a close imitation of the iconic show Friends. During the 
play, the characters go from living a perfectly ordinary 
existence to one fraught with drama. All of the sudden, 
the corny jokes go away, and instead of dealing with an 
untrained puppy, they ?nd themselves grappling with 
issues such as messy breakups, divorce, coming out, 
and depression. Their lives become complicated and 
unplanned, and they must learn to cope with it.
The small cast of this play was composed of junior acting 
majors: Chloe (Colleen Pulawksi), a romance writer 
with writer’s block; Connor (Jeremy Hois), her doting 
husband; Billy (Luke LaMontagne), a sex-crazed, funny 
man; Fiona (Olivia Brown), a bubbly blonde; and Mark 
(Benjamin Edelman), the straight-edged owner of the 
apartment.
The cast blended perfectly, staying in character through 
both the lighthearted sitcom moments and the dramatic, 
heart-pounding ones. Their perfect chemistry made 
viewers feel as though they were watching a scripted, 
orchestrated television show, until the world fell apart 
and the characters became real.
The show was smart and witty, not to mention painfully 
poignant. In a moment toward the end, when the 
characters are realizing with horror what dealing with 
the real world has done to them, Mark sits down 
with Chloe, who is resisting the return to normalcy. In 
order to convince her to forget Omar (Mitchell Edwards) 
— the dashing stranger with whom she has fallen in love 
and has made plans to escape — Mark describes his 
harrowing experience as a medic during 9/11. Seeing 
how Elyanow wrote the play in response to the media’s 
unresponsive attitude toward the crisis, it seemed 
appropriate for the show to close on such a somber note.
In essence, the cast and context of the show — eight 
friends, eight rooms, one big penthouse in the Big 
Apple — represented the carefully protected and 
forced innocence of Americans. When that naivety and 
blindness is shattered, the characters are tossed into 
crisis mode and are forced to come to terms with reality 
by discovering that their canned world is an illusion.
Through Dixon’s careful planning and design choices — 
from having the cast pose as if in an opening scene to 
introducing a theme song for Pals that closely resembles 
that of Friends— the message of the play is clearly 
conveyed, despite the risk of it getting lost in the many 
details of the plot. The entire cast and crew of the play 
should be applauded for creating a believable and 
meaningful play within a play scenario that resonated 
even after the lights went down.

Season 17 of Dancing with the Stars kicked off on 
Monday night promising a new format, new production 
— and of course, new stars. But this time, the show’s 
classic formula showed through: It’s the same dancing 
show time after time because stars’ success relies on 
dancing ability and likability in equal parts. As the 
seasons progress, there are a few cookie-cut roles that 
remain constant.
There is the athlete. This season, it’s Keyshawn Johnson, 
who moves in the stiff athletic way of a 6’4” former pro 
football player. His performance was marked by poor 
dancing and low scores.
There is the love interest — the partners that make us 
question if they’re more than just dance partners. This 
season it’s Pretty Little Liars actor Brant Daugherty 
and his partner, Peta Murgatroyd. The two quickly 
established that they were single and attractive, and 
there was a notable level of passion in their performance.
There are the forgotten stars — namely singer Christina 
Milian and actresses Elizabeth Berkley and Leah Remini. 
Milian came out strong with great choreography. Berkley 
seemed sweet and was a fair dancer, and Remini 
brought a lot of personality to the stage.
Actor Corbin Bleu danced dynamically. He is one of the 
few male dancers in the show’s history to really draw 
attention rather than let the professional do all the work. 
He displays a will to push himself, which resulted in a 
performance earning one of the top scores of the night.
There are the heartwarming stories. Former reality TV 
star Jack Osbourne focused his introduction on his 
experience with multiple sclerosis. He came across as a 
genuine, soft-spoken guy and impressed everyone with 
his dancing. Another inspiring story came from actress 
Valerie Harper: She was given just months to live due 
to lung and brain cancer, but she is now beating the 
odds and thriving on the show. She stole the hearts of 
many viewers not just with her story but with her sweet 
mannerisms and grace. She ?oated across the ?oor in an 
elegant, simple routine.
There are the stars that draw in a large number of 
viewers: Snooki, the self-proclaimed “hot mess,” took 
the stage looking strikingly thin. She promises that 
her partying days are over and she is ready to be more 
mature, but this claim fell ?at as she shrieked “ew” and 
“perv” at her dance partner. Personality aside, she was a 
great dancer, receiving praise from the judges. 
Bill Nye is the kind of contestant that makes this show 
so special. Nye offered an admittedly poor performance, 
receiving the lowest scores of the night. But the crowd 
chanted his name as he ?nished and booed animatedly 
when the judges criticized him.
Bill Nye was a true class act. He brought a rose for 
his partner in a ?ask, taking time to teach us the 
difference between a ?ask and beaker. He spoke in lovely 
expressions, exclaiming, “Even a blind squirrel ?nds a 
nut sometimes,” discussed evolution, and danced in 
an endearing way. As judge Carrie Ann Inaba put it, he 
is “the heart of the show.” While he cannot keep up in 
dancing ability, his personality might just be enough to 
buy him a few more weeks.
Credit must be given where due, and Glee star 
Amber Riley stole the stage Monday night. Judge 
Bruno Tonioli described her as the “tigress of season 
17.” She performed with ferocity and precision and 
received praise and high scores. While she is not the 
most widely-known star, she quickly grabbed viewers’ 
attention with her charisma. She spoke about wanting 
to be a role model for girls her size, wanting them to see 
her “throwing this weight around.” She was the most 
captivating and inspiring performer of the night and will 
surely go far in the competition.
While Dancing with the Stars is deeply rooted in the 
traditional format, it has yet to feel tired. The fresh crop 
of stars brings new life to the show and a promise for a 
season of fantastic dancing and dynamic personalities.

TV premiere season has begun, and on Tuesday night 
comes one of the season’s most anticipated pilots: ABC’s 
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
To be clear, this isn’t The Avengers. This is the team that 
?nds the superheroes, sorting through the weird to ?nd 
the spectacular.
The ensemble features Melinda May, a seasoned ?eld 
agent portrayed by Mulan voice actor Ming-Na Wen; 
newly recruited Grant Ward (Brett Dalton); hacker-
turned-team-member Skye (Chloe Bennet); and Leo 
Fitz and Jemma Simmons (Ian De Caestecker and 
Elizabeth Henstridge), a tag team of a tech genius and 
a biochemist. Together the team is the face of a new 
initiative formed by Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) 
following the events in The Avengers. Their job is 
to ?nd and keep tabs on emerging superheroes and 
otherworldly events, so that S.H.I.E.L.D. — the Strategic 
Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics 
Division — can have a better handle on superhuman 
events and threats.
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a continuation of The Avengers’ 
universe; currently, there are no plans to feature any of 
Marvel’s big-name superheroes, such as Iron Man or 
Thor, in any storylines. Executive producer Joss Whedon 
revealed at the Television Critics Association (TCA) 
Press Tour panel that the show is not intended to be 
“an Easter egg farm” for the Marvel universe. The show 
will be able to stand on its own, instead of constantly 
referring back to the past Marvel ?lms.
Whedon is no stranger to TV shows, having produced 
such classics as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the short-
lived Fire?y. Most recently, Whedon wrote and directed 
The Avengers and adapted William Shakespeare’s Much 
Ado About Nothing to the silver screen. Unfortunately 
for the show, he is also working on the sequel to The 
Avengers, which could reduce the amount of time he 
spends on Agents.
The show’s format will be serial in style, like its time slot 
competitor, CBS crime drama NCIS, but will feature a 
continuous storyline to bring the season together. 
TvLine.com reported that Avengers veteran Cobie 
Smulders, reprising her role as Agent Maria Hill in 
the pilot, will be the one to plant the seeds for the 
overarching mystery. Although currently her appearance 
has only been con?rmed for the ?rst episode — a 
surprise kept secret until the closed screening of the 
pilot at this summer’s San Diego Comic-Con — perhaps 
viewers will get to see more from Agent Hill after 
Smulders ?nishes as Robin Scherbatsky in the ?nal 
season of How I Met Your Mother.
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Agent Coulson was last seen 
in his death scene in The Avengers, but he’s back to 
head this new team as they head out on cases. For those 
confused about his resurrection, don’t worry — that 
story will come out. Whedon revealed at the panel that it 
will be “something of a drawn-out explanation.”
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. premieres tomorrow at 8 p.m. EST.

Superman is back but with a whole new look. Zach 
Snyder and Christopher Nolan join forces to reboot 
America’s favorite superhero with more action and

blessed Henry Cavill, who struggles as a quiet alien
