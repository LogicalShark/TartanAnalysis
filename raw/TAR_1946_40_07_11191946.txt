Students Pick 
Carnival Band
Tuesday and Wednesday, No­
vember 19 and 20, from 11:30 a. m. 
to 1:30 p. m., an all-school election 
will be held to determine what 
band the students want for Spring 
Carnival. Registration cards will 
be needed to vote.
There are to be four ballot 
boxes, one each in Margaret Mor­
rison, Fine Arts, Industries hall 
and Machinery hall. Students are 
requested to write the name of 
the band they want on the ballot.
Omicron Delta Kappa, which is 
sponsoring the carnival, urges ev­
eryone to vote. They state that 
the fullest consideration will be 
given the results of the poll.
Panhellenic Dance 
On November 23 
Stars Bill Leroy
The Panhellenic Dance, the first 
long-dress affair at Carnegie 
Tech this year, will be held this 
Saturday from 9:00 p. m. to 1:00 
a. m. in Thistle hall. Music will 
be supplied by the familiar Bill 
LeRoy and his orchestra.
Although this traditional dance, 
comparable to the Interfraternity 
Prom, is a closed affair (by invi­
tation only), it promises to be 
one of the most successful events 
of the year. Each sorority on cam­
pus has promised 80% attend­
ance. Men are requested to wear 
tuxedos but it is not strictly re­
quired. Flowers are strictly taboo.
Velma Latterman will head the 
decorations committee, aided by 
representatives from each sorori­
ty.
MMCC Observes 
Annual Color Day
The Freshman Color Day assem­
bly was held in the Little Thea­
ter at 11:30 Tuesday morning, 
November 12. Dr. Watkins, di­
rector of Margaret Morrison, wel­
comed the freshman women as a 
unified class and spoke to them 
about their new responsibilities 
and about what the colors mean 
to each class.
After this speech, the entire 
class, comprising one hundred and 
thirty women, received their rib­
bons of black and gold,- the col­
ors passed on to them by the class 
of 1946. The singing of the Alma 
Mater concluded the ceremony.
Tuesday afternoon, at 4:30, the 
Color Day Tea was held at Car­
negie Union in honor of the fresh­
man women. The freshman class 
officers acted as hostesses.
Revived Steffens Fund 
Offers Aid to Athletes
Next year will see the reissue of athletic scholarships by 
the Steffen Memorial Scholarship Fund, announced Dr. Robert 
E. Doherty at a luncheon given Thursday, November 14, at the
’ Duquesne club.
Buddy Rich And Band Entertain 
Large Crowd At Junior Prom
In spite of rumors to the con­
trary, Buddy Rich arrived for the 
Junior Prom on Saturday and en­
livened things with his drums, 
his vocalist, his personality, and 
his unique renditions.
The most-talked-about-drum­
mer in the business interspersed 
his soft, slow dance tunes with 
ear-shattering uproars of synco­
pated noise.
In introducing one of these mid­
dance specialties, Buddy announc­
ed breathlessly:
“Folks, we’ve got a little ditty 
here you’ve never heard before. 
You’ll have to be a bit quieter 
for it’s very pianissimo. Don’t try 
to dance to it for it’s a wee mite 
off tempo! Yep, a serene thing 
called ‘Quiet Riot’!”
Then with a great to-do, he 
launched into a drum tirade of 5.2 
minutes.
In the middle of the evening 
Delta Skull welcomed the stu­
dents. This was followed by a 
ceremony in which the new mem­
bers of Delta Skull were called.
During the half-hour intermis­
sion that followed fraternities 
gathered in the cabaret-styled 
Thistle hall for cokes and potato 
chips and the traditional song-fest.
The dance was probably one of 
the largest held at C. I. T. since 
the effect of the war was felt on 
the manpower. The dance floor 
was packed to the hilt and Thistle 
hall was never empty.
After intermission Buddy open­
ed up again with a few smooth 
danceable pieces but eventually 
ripped into a mad thing by the 
name of “Curb Service.”
Towards 1 a. m. the huge crowd, 
which had completely filled the
large gymnasium, began drifting 
away to breakfasts and more 
dancing at the fraternity houses.
N. Williams Named 
Frosh President
On October 29th. the Margaret 
Morrison Senate held an election 
at the Margaret Morrison Car­
negie College for freshman offi­
cers. Nancy Williams was elected 
president; Mary Nettleton, vice- 
president; Jane Anderson, secre­
tary; Doreen Evans, treasurer; and 
Freda Alexander, Senate repre­
sentative.
The newly elected freshman of­
ficers voted for the applicant to 
be chosen for Women’s Guild 
Representative. Peggy McGuire 
was chosen.
Honor Students 
Receive Awards; 
Doherty Speaks
The Carnegie Day assembly, an­
nual exercises in observance of 
Andrew Carnegie’s birthday, will 
be held next Tuesday, November
26, at 11 a. m. in the Carnegie 
Music hall. All classes will be dis­
missed from 10:20 a. m. until 1:30 
p. m., to permit the entire student 
body to attend.
The principal purpose of the 
celebration is to honor those 
students who hold scholarships. 
The three honoraries with the 
highest average factor will tap 
new initiates. Scholastic cups will 
be awarded to the sorority and 
dormitory having the highest 
average factor. Names of the 
scholarship students, honor stu­
dents, and the newly-tapped in­
itiates will be listed in the pro­
gram. Copies will be sent to the 
high schools from which these 
students came.
At the ceremony Dr. Robert
E. Doherty will speak on the topic, 
“Where Are We Going?” Mr. 
Frank E. Foote, president of the 
Alumni federation, will bring a 
greeting from the Alumni. The

Faculty Parking Area Defined; 
Users Must Present Passes
By arrangement with the Ad­
ministration, the following areas 
have been set aside exclusively for 
faculty parking:
(1) The region back of Machin­
ery hall extending to the Engi­
neering building,
(2) The street on the campus 
extending west from the Mar­
garet Morrison gate and south to­
ward Administration hall as far 
as the Barrier.
Full-time teaching members of 
the faculty of the rank of In­
structor or higher are eligible for 
identification cards which will 
entitle them to park in these areas. 
In addition to these faculty mem­
bers, space will be allotted to a 
few key administration officers 
and employees, whose duties ren­
der it imperative that their cars 
be parked on the campus.
It is expected that this plan
Abramson Heads Station WCIT
Last Friday Carnegie Tech’s 
campus radio station, WCIT, held 
a meeting at which the staff was 
organized, and plans were made 
for the presentation of programs 
in the future.
At present the staff consists of: 
Eph Abramson, station manager; 
Bob Parks, production manager; 
Jim Woodford, chief engineer; 
Dave Crantz, program manager; 
Ernie Lowenstein, business mana­
ger; and George B. Kimberly, fac­
ulty advisor.
This week WCIT will be on the 
air, for on Monday, November 18, 
an inaugural broadcast will be 
presented and following that the 
station will have broadcasts daily. 
For the first few weeks only one 
hour—from 7:00 to 8:00 p. m.—-of 
daily programs will be scheduled
[Continued on Page 3)
will be put into operation begin­
ning Monday morning, November 
25. Signs will be posted and guards 
will be stationed at the entrances 
to check incoming traffic. 
Throughout the school year, cars 
parked in the reserved areas will 
be checked, and the license num­
bers of any cars not belonging in 
these reserved areas will be re­
ported to the Dean’s office. Action 
will be taken against offenders.

Ralph W. Sill Wins 
Scarab Contest
Ralph W. Sill, junior architec­
tural student, was awarded first 
prize in the Scarab sketch exhibit 
according to the results announced 
last Friday afternoon. Second and 
third prizes were taken by John J. 
Loftus and Harry B. Grant, re­
spectively. Both are senior stu­
dents in the architectural depart­
ment.
All of the entries in the exhibit, 
which was limited to architectural 
students, were water colors. All 
twenty entries were considered 
excellent and the judge, Professor 
Raymond Simboli, had difficulty 
in selecting the best. Scarab, an 
srchitectural honorary society, 
will award the winning artists 
cash prizes of seven, five, and 
three dollars each.
The local prize sketches will be 
forwarded to the University of 
Kansas to compete in the national 
sketch exhibit to be held there in 
conjunction with the national 
Scarab convention, to be held No­
vember 24 through 26. Loren 
Smith will represent the Carnegie 
Tech Scarab temple at the con­
vention,
The fund committee was active 
during the war, but it presented 
no scholarships since C.I.T. had 
no football team and therefore 
had no need for athletes.
The Steffen Fund was estab­
lished in 1937 in honor of Wally 
Steffen, one-time Tech football 
coach, as a means by which the 
alumni and friends of the school 
might present scholarships to 
those athletically able in high and 
preparatory schools. Candidates 
must first be scholastically elig­
ible, and are then selected for 
their athletic ability.
Dr. Doherty stated that inter­
collegiate sports will continue at 
Tech as long as students want 
them, but that scholastic stand­
ards will not be lowered to im­
prove the quality of athletic 
teams.
Faculty Requests 
Reconsideration 
Of Council Change
[Ed.: See Council minutes, Page 2]
The vote taken recently on the 
constitutional amendment limit­
ing the size of Student council 
was declared void late last week 
by the administration.
At its regular meeting, the Fac­
ulty Advisory committee voted to 
recommend to Dean Warden:
“That the vote of the General 
assembly held on October 29, 1946, 
which approved the proposed 
amendment by the required two- 
thirds majority be declared void 
and that another general assem­
bly be called at a later date to 
pass on the proposed amendment.”
This action was taken in re­
sponse to the pressure of student 
groups on campus who believed 
that a sufficient number of Coun­
cil members had not voted in 
favor of the presentation of the 
amendment; that insufficient pub­
licity had been given the amend­
ment before the vote was taken; 
and that the assembly at which 
the amendment was approved was 
not conducted according to par­
liamentary procedure.
The faculty advisory commit­
tee decided that the Council con­
stitutional requirement that three- 
fourths of its voting members ap­
prove the presentation of an 
amendment had been met because 
in amending actions the president 
of student council cannot be a 
voting member.
The vote taken was voided be­
cause the advisory committee felt 
that “insufficient publicity had

The College Teamif
Those of you who have fought in an infantry rdivision,v hi a - 
bomber group, or in a ship’s crew know the significance of 
teamwork in winning a war; those of you who have played 
football, or basketball or any other group sport know the sig­
nificance of teamwork in winning à game.
Thèse are probably the two most obvious roles in wThich 
teamwork is the star. Yet, in winning a peace, establishing a 
democratic government, raising a family, organizing a group, 
spQtisorin'g an affair, in fact in anything where more than one 
person is concerned, teamwork must be present.
By teamwork wre are referring to a spirit of cooperation, 
responsibility, and enthusiasm, shared equally by the group.
Recently at C.I.T. the obvious lack of this spirit has been 
a conspicuous sore point.
This- criticism is not directed at the football team. It is
aimed at the small, weak cheering section which failed to give
the team its best support ; at a half-hearted Student- council 
which eanV even make a quorum ; at a freshman regulations 
committee which was praeticaUy non-existent ; and at those 
thousands of individual students, who don’t turn out for school 
games, "who fáil to vote in school elections, who never lift a 
finger tti support any school affair or activity.
To these parasites we offer, in Casey’s inimitable lingo, “a 
burp to the breeze.”
There are always two sides to everything, though ; so even at 
Carnegie there are some evidences of teamwork. The Kiltie Band 
is one. The successful Junior Prom of last Saturday is another.
Nonetheless, these are the exceptions. In general the respon­
sibilities of this college community are borne by a minute min­
ority who are contributing a great deal more than ftièir allotted
share. • • > • b -
This is not teamwork. This is the halfback trying to play
a football game while :the rest of the team is sitting on the 
bench criticizing. He’s sure to lose the game. But don’t blame 
him ! Blame the other ten men.
Saint Joan
This issue of thé Tartan will go 
to press before the opening per­
formance of Saint Joan at the Lit­
tle Theatre, and so the review of 
the production of this play by 
Geergé Bernard Shaw will appear 
next' week. In its stead we would 
like to bring you some historical 
and sociological introduction, with­
out \Vhich the understanding and 
apprêfciafion of the play and its 
individual characters would be
In the beginning of the fifteenth 
century there existed no nations 
as we know them today. Europe 
—the extent of the western world 
at jtpè time—was ruled by the 
Chiirbh and Feudalism, two pow­
ers that were international and, 
side by side, dominated all the 
people of the earth.
In each region, the feudal 
knights elected from their ranks a 
primus inter pares, first among 
equals. They called him king, and 
in return for the administrative 
offices he performed, pledged him 
their military support. But other 
than that they owed him no alle­
giance, and at no time did such a 
kin# hâve any power over the 
tenants of the. feudal lord*, or pos­
se«« any lands other than his per­
sonal inheritance.
Thus, with the Church setting 
itself no as the sole earthly rep­
resentative and interpreter of 
God, private man encountered an 
intermediary between himself and 
h» Lord ho#i in the temporal and 
the "spiritual field.
By rebelling against this situa­
tion. Joar. of Aw became both the
ftret Nationalist the first Pro*
tesfant of modern times. With 
all the fervor of her great mind 
she believed in the national unity 
of a people, bound together by 
their allegiance to a king who 
reigns over his realm as God’s 
bailiff. And at the same time her 
message wTas one of protest against 
the spiritual tyranny of medieval 
Catholicism. She found great so­
lace and was a firm believer in 
the services of the Church, but ¿he 
considered the priest only an ad­
visor and helper, and not an in­
dispensable interpreter and exe­
cutor of God’s will.
For her time Joan’s ideas were 
analogous to and every bit as rev­
olutionary as the concepts of 
world government and the aban­
donment of national sovereignty 
are today. This ability of the 
Maid to see farther and probe 
deeper than other people, added 
to her immense and almost intui­
tive knowledge of strategy and- 
tactics make her one of the most 
astounding geniuses in modem 
history—and yet the duality of her 
character included a girl with all 
the ingenuousness and presump­
tion typical of youth.
Her greatness induced fear in 
her contemporaries, her imma­
turity and complete lack of tact 
. first irritated and finally, antagon­
ized them, and the combination of 
both drove her to her death at the 
stake. Her political enemies—the 
feudal lords as personified by the 
Earl of Warwick—sought her 
el imination; the Church cast her 
out as a heretic, and her former 
friends and allie«, goaded con­
stantly by her Incredible preemp­
tion, were glad to get rid of her,

The Passing Parade
By Carl Klahr
Now that the political scales 
have tipped from the late Presi­
dent Roosevelt’s “a little left of 
center” to somewhere right of 
center, one can wonder if we are 
entering a period of “normalcy” 
such as followed the first world 
war. In fact the way people act 
and talk now may presage such a 
change. During the election cam­
paign it was a rare Democratic 
candidate, outside the South, who 
did not have the appelative, “com­
munist”, hurled at him.
As one man put it: “Democrat^ 
I think they’re all communists 
now.” And the newspapers blaz­
oned that purple word in their 
headlines in a way distinctly rem­
iniscent of the 1920’s.
In those days every strike was 
a “communist strike” and mobs 
roamed the streets armed with a 
bucket of tar and a bagful of 
feathers looking for communists 
and strikers. A man didn’t dare 
approach his boss for a raise; he 
would be told, “Get out of here 
you dirty communist.” Because 
of this attitude labor unions had 
some very lean years. People who 
saw communists under their beds 
would certainly see them in 
unions.
While it is perfectly all right 
to be on guard against communist
Student Council
Special Meeting 
November 13, 1946
Because a quorum was not 
present, this meeting can not be 
termed as a regular Student Coun­
cil meeting, but must be called a 
Special meeting. Therefore, all 
motions passed during this meet­
ing must be approved by the 
Council at the next regular meet­
ing.
The meeting was called to order 
at 4:45 p. m.
Those present were: Misses Ol- 
lett and Zimmerman, Messrs. En­
gle, Dismukes, Yorkin, Franks, 
Christenson, Garner, and Tritle. 
COMMITTEE REPORTS:
Social Committee:
The Kappa Sigma Fraternity 
petitioned to be allowed to re­
serve the date of February 22, 
1947, on the school calendar for 
the purpose of holding their an­
nual Closed Invitational Dance. 
Mr. Christenson moved that Coun­
cil accept this petition.
Motion carried.
OLD BUSINESS:
The discussion of the two dances 
which Beaux Arts desires to hold 
was tabled until the next meet­
ing.
Mr. Garner read the following 
decision of the Faculty Advisory 
Committee on Student Activities: 
concerning the recommended 
change to the Student Council 
Constitution:
“. . . The Faculty Advisory
Committee voted to recommend to 
Dr. B. E. Warden, Director of the 
Division of Student Personnel and 
Welfare, that the following ac­
tions be approved: (1) That the 
action of Student Council in sub­
mitting the proposed amendment 
to a vote of the students at a Gen­
eral Assembly be approved. It 
was the opinion of the Faculty 
Advisory Committee on Student 
Activities that the requirement 
that there be a favorable vote of 
‘. . . three-fourths of the voting 
members of this Council’ was 
met, since in the case of amend­
ment actions, the president of Stu­
dent Council cannot be a voting 
member; (2) That the vote of the 
General Assembly held on Octo­
ber 29, 1946, which approved the 
proposed amendment by the re­
quired two-thirds majority, be 
declared void and that another 
General Assembly be called at a 
later date to pass on the proposed 
amendment. This action is recom­
mended because the Advisory 
Committee felt that insufficient 
publicity had been given the is­
sue.”
A discussion was held concern­
ing the substitution of one day’s 
vacation at Easter for one day off 
at Spring Carnival. No decliion
was made and the discussion was 
tabled for action at the next next 
meeting.
The meeting was. adjourned at 
5:30 p. m.
Respectfully submitted, 
JEAN MARIE PRICE, 
Secretary.
influence, because communism is 
synonymous with totalitarianism 
and personal liberty stands above 
all else to Americans, to turn a 
red scare into a public mania is 
dangerous to everyone. , - * 
For instance, the Sacco-Ven- 
zetti murder case of the twenties,. . 
Most people agree today' that 
“justice” was shot through and 
through with the anti-red mania 
current at that time, and that, the. . 
two defendants were hanged as.
innocent men. ...
Besides such aberrations of jus- 
tice, an anti-communist mania can . 
cover up the actions of strong, 
insidious organizations, which are" 
really inimical to personal lib­
erty. Take for instance the new­
ly organized Columbians Inc. with 
headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. 
Its organizers (who also happens • 
to be its treasurer) is one Homer- 
Loomis, who says, “We tell people 
what they want to hear.” Accord- . 
ing to Loomis, people want to hear .! 
about race hatred, about deporting 
“alien elements”, about a united 
America — united under Colum­
bians Inc.
Friend Loomis makes no bones ; 
about his intentions. He wants to 
control the USA by making' Co­
lumbians politically active in all 
48 states. A clever showman, he 
clothes his cohorts in US Army 
Khaki, and has designed a start­
ling insignia—a red Thunderbolt. ; , 
At meetings the Columbians give 
their salute—Hail Columbia—then.. 
march around the room to the 
strains of martial music. Reading 
like a page out of Sinclair Lewis’
It Can’t Happen Here, the Colum*- 
bians are rapidly gaining con­
verts.

Female Manners
November 14, 1946.
Dear Editor,
I am a poor but deserving en­
gineering student, with simple 
tastes and an artistic soul, but I 
am distressed. It’s about the girls 
in this dump. Either they’re ultra 
spoiled or Just plain damn crude 
—they have no manners.
It’s like this: I go plodding 
along the walks, my mind filled 
with thoughts of beauty and class­
es, when along comes a crew of 
Amazons, six abreast with a de­
fiant hitch in the foundation gar­
ments. I approach them. They ap­
proach me, and instead of giving 
me a small portion of the side­
walk to pass them on, they force 
me cff into the cold, wet grass 
without even a “Pardon me.”
And then when I try to be gen­
tlemanly and polite towards them, 
they laugh at me. The other day 
I held a door open for one of 
them and she said, “Thanks, Jerk.” 
Can you imagine the turmoil with­
in my soul?
Another instance—When I take 
my tray and finally find a chair 
in Skibo, some dishevelled thing 
that looks slightly like a girl, yanks 
the chair from under me, and if 
I protest she gives me a sour look 
as if to say, “Go die!”
Just how long and how far 
can such a condition go? Are the 
future mothers of America to 
come from this ill mannered set?
I wrote to Mr. Anthony about this 
business, and he replied, “So 
you’ve noticed it too, eh?”
Editors, please call this to their 
attention..

“Skibo Scraps”
Editor, Carnegie Tartan:
Since the beginning of school 
this year, we have frantically 
searched the pages of the Tartan 
for that old familiar column, “Ski­
bo Scraps,” but generally we have 
been unable to find it. This is • 
indeed strange, for most of the 
people we know always look for 
the schpol gossip first. Although 
we know that th« purpow of the 
paper ii net to provide flirt, this
unusual column attracted many 
readers. ¦
We of the student body know . 
that there must be a reason for . 
its absence. Is it a lack of writers 
or of printable material? We hap­
pen to know that the two report­
ers who wrote the column last i 
year are again on the Tartan 
staff. . .
Why not let them write it? As 
for material, we were frequent , 
contributors, and we know that 
the rest of the students who loaf 
in Skibo or the Grill were glad to 
supply the writers with informa­
tion.
At the present time, the Scottie 
is the only source of social news. 
However it only comes but six 
times a year, whereas the Tartan 
is a weekly publication. This 
would be very beneficial, we 
think, to the circulation of the 
paper.
Please give a little time, Miss 
Editor, to the problems of your 
paper.
Sincerely,
Two M. M. Sophomores.
Carnegie Inn Service
In a recent (November) issue of 
the college humor magazine, The f 
Scottie, there was published a 
letter regarding the quantity and 
quality of food at the Carnegie 
Inn. To reply to this uhfounded 
complaint is the purpose of this

the waiters at this self-same Inn.
Let us examine this letter from 
“one (of many) starved dorm co­

give our slide rules and drawing 
boards for a teeth-sinking session 
with a juicy and lusciously tender 
sirloin (and is there one among 
us who wouldn’t? . . . the fool!).
Too bad one can’t realize that # 
steak, until a few weeks ago, was . 
unobtainable and now it is slightly 
beyond our price range.
I quote: “the almost entire lack 
of food of any kind”!! May I say 
that we waiters have been ordered 
(we were from the beginning of ; 
the year) to give the girls all the 4 
vegetables they desired. Natur­

Enervated Elevator’s Extinction 
Expected On Every Excursion
Have you ever watched the face 
of an Arts student as he gingerly 
steps into the Fine Arts elevator? 
Although he regards this medieval 
cage-like structure paternally and 
patronizingly, he still feels a quiv- 
when approach­
ing it for a “ride”.
Anyone who habitually rides 
the elevator soon becomes aware 
that the odds are overwhelmingly 
against reaching his floor safely. 
And when a great number of 
people are tightly packed in, the 
car goes up slowly and ominously, 
so that every occupant quivers 
with fear at the horrible images 
his over-worked imagination con- 
jurs.
Every year, when an upperclass- 
map. returns to Fine Arts to find 
the same rickety old elevator, he 
usually makes some casual com­
ment such as “Ye Gods, is that 
thing still here?”

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1Ô4Ô
Fraternity Row
At an uproarious homecoming 
party at the TX house on Sat­
urday night George Phillips, DU, 
started to devour a drinking glass, 
so great was his hunger. TX now 
plans to send baskets of food to 
the starving DU’s at frequent in­
tervals.
Robert Zowler and Harold Hall 
pledged ATO last week, bringing 
the class total up to fourteen.
Bagpiping Phi Kaps Bob Camp­
bell and Walt Tice appreciate the 
feminine winter skirt problem, 
and they have engineered a so­
lution—based on kilt vs. Forbes 
Field wind experience—flesh-col­
ored long underwear.
The Phi Kaps are proud to have 
young, energetic Dr. Schwob as 
their faculty adviser. However, 
they want to get him a date to 
help him chaperone their parties.
Discerning SAE’s recently en­
tertained the candidates for fresh­
man Queen at a house party. After 
viewing a skit written by Dick 
Alexander, the glamor girls were 
interviewed by Bob Johnson — 
probably as to when they had free 
nights.
Smiling Cliff Gower, Wiscon­
sin’s gift to CIT, is SAE’s lucky 
thirteenth pledge.
The Delts’ homecoming party 
was a great success for two rea­
sons: they had an inexhaustable 
supply of beer and they had pert 
Pat Smith in a fascinating red 
dress.
Bill Jordan and Stan Lord, DU 
stalwarts, finally discovered that 
they shared a common belief— 
women are the root of all evil.
Pride and joy of the TX’s is 
their undefeated 'touch-football 
team, recent winners of the Na­
tional League title.
This months nomination for the 
DU POM award went to Bill Jor­
dan, who accepted the honor with 
a short speech of tribute to those 
of his brothers who have pre­
viously held the trophy.
PiKA “Orchid Girl” for Novem­
ber is brainy Cwen President 
Mary Lou Thorpe. The orchid was 
presented at a dinner party at­
tended by Dean Jesse Yon and 
Mrs. Ruth Hespenheide.

The proposed amendment will, 
if passed, provide that represen­
tation in student council will be 
in the ratio of one member per 
150 students instead of one mem­
ber for every 100 students as it 
has been iri the past. This action 
will reduce the size of Council.
Advocates of the amendment 
state that a council of reduced size 
will be more efficient. Its oppo­

can be more easily controlled by 
a political machine.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Bison Stampede Tartan Gridders, 28-0
TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Andy Cantini
This is Andy Cantini subbing for the big boss, Dick “Cousin- 
Weak-Eyes” Heckman who along with George “Uncle Gordo” Maley 
has gathered his polished metal specimens and taken off for Atlantic 
City to attend the Metallurgist convention—you know what a Metal­
lurgist is so I needn’t repeat it here and be frowned upon by the 
Reformers’ Union, Local 22.
Those of you who did not see 
the game Saturday missed a bat­
tle of the century. Tech was a 
superb team, and all who were 
there expressed high praise for 
the valiant effort that the boys 
displayed. Being a staunch print­
er, I can’t help at this time to 
include a few plugs for the four 
stalwart printers who are mem­
bers of the football squad. In Sat­
urday’s game, “Roily” Gottendorf 
and “Wolfy” Wolfarth were es­
pecially outstanding in their roles. 
Big “Moose” DeMuesy and George 
Matonis also figured prominently 
in the tussle. Incidentally Matonis 
is one of the best place-kickers in 
this part of the country, but thus 
far he has had no chance to dis­
play his talents. Come Saturday, 
I am sure that George will get 
the nod.
Some of us are apt to give out 
with a sarcastic grin when the 
administration insists that Tech’s
curriculum cannot compete with 
big-time football. I agree with the 
administration. If someone should 
ask how it was done in the good 
old days, the answer is that it 
wasn’t. There are very few if any 
gridders of that era who were 
able to finish in the regular four 
years. For most it took five years. 
Condit, Dobrus, Prueger, Muha, 
and even the immortal Howard 
Harpsted are but a few who 
were forced to extend their time 
at Tech.
However, I can see a solution 
to the problem — in fact two of 
them. One is to have a five-year 
course for the athletes so that 
their schedule would be consider­
ably lighter. For those who would 
want to finish in four years, sum­
mer courses could be offered to 
enable them to catch up. The sec­
ond, and in my opinion the best,

reviving field hockey as a wom­

Women’s Athletic Association var­

During the first ten minutes of 
play Tech held its own, but in the 
last part of the first half Pitt man­
aged to make two goals. Tech

times but failed to score. In the

Bison Stalled for Three Quarters; 
Highberger Intercepts Two Passes
A scrappy Tartan eleven must have forgotten to read the 
Buffalo press writeups before the game Saturday because, for 
three bruising quarters, they showed a complete contdknpt for 
their heavier, more experienced opponents. While the final score 
of 28 to 0 would not seem to indicate it, the Skibos played their 
best game of the year and looked entirely different from the 
team that had dropped four straight contests playing list­
less, uninspired football. Not enough can be said for the spirit 
the fellows displayed Saturday.
The game started as Tech kick­
ed off to the Buffalo 25 from 
where the Bisons quickly gar­
nered their initial first down on 
a run by their star halfback, Lou 
Corriere. On the next play they 
fumbled and the ball was quickly 
retrieved by Dick DeMeusy at 
mid-field.
Highberger Stars
Sam Highberger now took over 
for Tech and showed that he was 
going to play as he had never 
played before. On 8 consecutive 
plays Highberger took the ball 8 
times and had advanced to the 
Buffalo 26-yard line before he 
was finally stopped. Many a mouth 
fell open as what was formerly a 
non-existent Tech offense devel­
oped into a dynamo.
It was now the visitors’ turn to 
show what they could do and Cor­
riere started off by skirting the 
Tech right end for a first down to 
the 37. On the next play he came 
back off tackle and only a fine 
tackle stopped him from going 
all the way as he was pulled down 
from behind on the Tech 44. Cor­
riere then dropped back to pass 
but Highberger took things into 
his own hands as he made a beau­
tiful interception to break up the 
Buffalo scoring threat.
Quick Kicks Effective 
% After trying the Bison defense 
and finding it too tough, High­
berger got off the first of a series 
of quick kicks that kept the vis­
itors deep in their own territory 
for most of the first half.
Finally retrieving the ball on 
their own 13, Buffalo turned on 
the steam as Corriere passed to 
Wolf for a first down on their own 
27. Again Corriere passed but 
again the ubiquitous Mr. High­
berger was equal to the occasion 
and intercepted on the Buffalo 35. 
Tartans Shift Formation
The Tartans now shifted back 
to the T formation, after operat­
ing from the single wing for most 
of the afternoon, and quickly 
fumbled to end the quarter.
The second period was largely 
a kicking duel" between Conk for 
Buffalo and Highberger for Tech 
as neither team could make an 
impression on the opponent’s de­
fense. With only two minutes left 
in the half Corriere broke loose 
on a pass from Gerard and went 
all the way for the visitors’ first 
touchdown.
Kiltie Band Wags Scottie Tail
During the half-time festivities 
the Kiltie band showed that the 
athletic de-emphasis had not hurt 
them any. They put on a show 
worthy of the best bands in the 
country and their Scottie with the 
wagging tail was outstanding.
The third quarter again found 
the teams stalemated and the 
kicking duel took up where it had 
left off before the end of the first 
half.
Buffalo found that they were 
not getting anywhere by playing 
football so they started a little

It must also have been quite a 
strain on Coach Bill Donohoe, as 
he spent most of his time on the 
sidelines trying to point out the 
numerous infractions to the offi­
cials. It didn’t do much good, how­
ever, because their seeing-eye 
dogs seemed completely incapable 
of leading the officials to the right 
place at the right time.
Tech Defense Weakens 
The rough playing finally told 
in the last quarter as the Tartan 
defense, which had turned a pre­
dicted rout into a hard-fought 
battle, finally fell apart. After 
Donohue had quick-kicked Tech 
out of danger the Bisons started 
a sustained drive sparked again 
by Corriere that ended with Ger­
ard going over for the second 
touchdown of the day on a quar­
ter-back sneak from the Tech 2 
yard line.
This was quickly followed by 
another drive that ended with 
Mittlesteadt taking a pass from 
Gerard and stepping into the end- 
zone to make the score 21 to 0. A 
steady stream of fresh men could 
nqt help the Tartans now and the 
game ended with Corriere taking 
another pass from Gerard for the 
fourth and final score of the day.
The whole team deserves credit 
for the game, but particularly do 
Sam Highberger in the backfield, 
Guttendorf and Baklarz at guard, 
and the ends who kept the potent 
Buffalo offense hemmed in all 
afternoon.

INTRAMURAL ROUND-UP
Pittsburgh, Nov. 19—(Special)—Coach Risedorf’s Intramural of­
fice announced today that the winner of Tech’s touch-football com­
petition will meet the Pitt champion on Dec. 5, at Pitt.
This game will probably be played in the Stadium. This is the 
first of a series of playoffs between the champions of the various 
intramural sports. Definite plans haye,also been made for basketball, 
foul-shooting, and softball com- ------------------------------------------------------
Fighting Tartan Toemen Edged 
By Oberlin Booters in 1 - 0 Battle
Four 1st String Players Out of Action Leaves Tartan Team Weakened; 
Last Quarter Rally Fails; Season Record Reads Three Wins, Four Losses
petition between the two schools.
This year a toss of the coin 
will decide on whose campus each 
sport will be played. In the fu­
ture the games will be played at 
Tech every other year.
Tech’s touch football champion 
is yet to be crowned. Last week’s 
games left one league tied, an­
other undecided, and the pace-set­
ting Theta Xi on top in the third. 
PiKA’s Trip Beta Sigs
The PiKA’s dropped the Beta 
Sigs 19 to 14 to fight their way 
into a post-season play-off with 
the Tau Delts for the champion­
ship of the American League. The 
PiKA’s tagged the Beta Sigs for 
three safeties, while the Beta Sigs 
returned the compliment once. 
This makes some kind of a mod­
ern record of the number of dou­
ble pointers in one game.
The Beta Sigs led 6 to 5 at half- 
time, but a PiKA touchdown off­
set a Beta Sig first down and safe­
ty to give them a 10 to 9 margin 
as they entered the final period. 
A wide-open fourth quarter with 
the breaks going in favor of the 
PiKA’s made the final score read 
19 to 14.
The PiKA’s and the Tau Delts 
battled for the American League 
crown last night after the paper 
went to press. The only other 
game in the league last week fea­
tured the Tau Delts clipping the 
Dorm Combine 16 to 8.
Theta Xi walked away with the 
National League when the last 
threat to thdir undefeated record 
forfeited. The Kilroy A.C., run­
ner-up to the T.X.’s, had an easy 
day as they took D.U. to the tune 
of 20 to 2. The Betas failed to 
break into the win column as the 
Phi Kaps rolled to a 25 to 12 vic­
tory.
In the Federal League the Delts 
are being worked overtime. Their 
10 to 9 win over the Barracks of 
a week ago was successfully pro­
tested and the game was replayed.
The Delts repeated — this time 
5 to 2. The Delts came from be­
hind in the last quarter to clinch 
the contest when Bob Harlow 
skirted left end for the winning 
touchdown.
Delt’s Championship Protested
Just when the Delts were cele­
brating their championship, the 
Sigma Nu protest was accepted, 
and now those two teams will play 
this afternoon. If the Delts lose, 
they will have to battle the Bar­
racks again before a champ can 
be crowned.
The other game in the Federal 
League was a 17 to 1 lacing of the 
Musical Maulers at the hands of 
the Sigma Nu’s.
The campus championship play­
offs will be Wednesday, Friday, 
and Monday: Theta Xi vs. Tau 
Delta Phi or Pi Kappa Alpha; Tau 
Delta Phi or Pi Kappa Alpha vs. 
Delta Tau Delta; Theta Xi vs. 
Delta Tau Delta.
Football may be almost over, 
but intramural activity is just 
commencing. Table tennis, volley 
ball, and bowling all start this 
week. Wrestling is now in its sec­
ond week, and handball entries 
are due Friday.
The table tennis entries include 
64 singles players, 20 pairs of 
doubles players, and 16 teams of 
six. The competition will last over 
the Christmas holidays and will 
end on Jan. 22.
A badly crippled Tartan soccer 
team, striving for their fourth 
victory of the season, received 
their fourth setback as the Ober­
lin booters edged them out 1-0.
Four key-men of the Tartan 
squad and some of the substitutes 
were unable to make the 300-mile 
round trip to Oberlin, Ohio. Dick 
Heckman, veteran goalkeeper, and 
Ed McCabe, stellar left fullback, 
were laid up with severe colds. 
Willy “The Brute” William was 
still ailing from a leg injury he 
suffered in a practice game with 
the Pennsylvania Deaf School. 
George De Moraes’s studies pre­
vented him from making the trip. 
Only Tally In First Period
One hundred chilled fans turn­
ed out for the opening kickoff. 
It was a close and hardfought bat­
tle. Even though they were on the 
defense for the greater part of 
the game, the Skibo eleven were 
spirited and fought to the gun to 
erase the home team’s one-point 
margin.
Midway in the first quarter Don 
Illig, Oberlin’s right wing, lofted 
a towering corner kick in front of 
the Carnegie goal where Maison- 
pierre headed the ball into a 
scramble of players. Hud Taggart, 
sub center forward, retrieved it
and easily split the goal posts for 
the game’s only score.
Tech threatened a few times 
during the opening stanza, but the 
boys were unable to cash in on 
their opportunities. The second 
quarter was strictly a defensive 
battle for the fighting Tartans. 
Time and again the ball came sail­
ing towards the Carnegie goal, but 
every Oberlin thrust was repulsed.
Marty Dorf, substituting for the 
ailing Heckman, made some mag­
nificent saves. Ralph Kindblom 
and Art Mraz turned in sparkling 
performances at fullback and half­
back respectively.
It was a good thing that Coach 
Pat O’Connor closely timed the 
second quarter, which like the 
other three was to last 20 min­
utes. After 24 minutes of the peri­
od had elapsed, he shouted at the 
referee and asked him to check 
the time. Sure enough, the ref­
eree’s watch had stopped and still 
indicated some 8 minutes to go.
The third quarter was very 
similar to the second with the
Tartans on the defense during the 
entire period, but the boys re'ally 
gave Oberlin a few jitters dur­
ing the final stanza. The Tartans 
looked like a different team; surg­
ing towards the Oberlin goal con­
tinually.
One Point Margin Too Much v
It seemed as though the boys 
were determined to deadlock* the 
game. Oberlin’s coach frantically 
rushed one substitute after an­
other into the game to stop - the 
Tartan onslaughts. During the 
hectic period, Hamilton, Tech’s 
left wing, had to be helped off the 
field.
Play was faster and harder, than 
in any of the other stanzas, but 
the Techites could no more than 
throw a few scares into their op­
ponents. After the final Whistle, 
Coach O’Connor commended the 
squad for their spirit and fine per­
formance.
Though it was one for the loss 
column, it was one of the best 
games the Tartans have played 
this season.

Drama Dept. 
Gives St. Joan
The second play of the season 
presented by the drama depart­
ment in the Little Theater in the 
Fine Arts Building is Bernard 
Shaw’s Saint Joan.
The first presentation of this 
play was Monday evening, No­
vember 18, and it Will continue to 
run nightly through Tuesday, No­
vember 26. Since this play, deal­
ing with the life of Joan of Arc, 
is somewhat longer than those 
usually produced in the Little 
Theater, the doors will close at 
8:00 instead of the usual 8:30.
Talbot Pearson will direct Saint 
Joan, and his past successes in the 
Little Theater are assurance of 
another.
Tickets are available in Mr. Mc-

ß&itosiial
Although there has been one 
Thanksgiving holiday celebrated 
in our country since the war’s end, 
the one soon to come will probably 
be more significant, especially in 
the homes to which service men 
have returned since the previous 
celebration.
Along with the turkey and mince 
pie, there should be an undercur­
rent of gratitude for -the reinstate­
ment of normalcy, the rebirth of 
common endeavors, enterprise, 
and simply for being, an American.
To be sure, an American is, in 
God’s eyes, no better man his 
counter-racial friends, but he does 
have a personal integrity hard to 
find in the many corners of the. 
globe.
This very heritage, out-growth 
of his forefather’s desire to main­
tain his individualism, has been 
the basis of his prosperous growth 
from the first freezing colony on 
the Massachusetts coast to the 
present vital, hustling young na­
tion.
Compared to the history of the 
nationalism of the European coun­
tries, the United States is still in 
the embryonic stage, but in com­
parison to the degree of civiliza­
tion reached in the years of ex­
istence, of these nations, ours has 
far surpassed any dream of im­
agination.
Any service man who has 
served overseas could tell you of 
the countless numbers whose only 
livelihood was the product of the 
wornout earth, their few crude 
implements and almost futile hu-

man efforts. The standard of liv­
ing so taken for granted by these 
people would shock the average 
American, for his living standard 
would resemble a millionaire’s 
fare to the European peasant.
Our advantages are numerous, 
and, unfortunately, as unthought 
of as the fate of a peon; we can 
be glad for our clothes, more than 
a rag or two; a home, clean and 
comfortable, more than the peas­
ant hut; our education which is 
so readily open to all and so far 
above that of our less fortunate 
brothers; our government, though 
highly criticized, and bungling in 
its infancy, still the closest to any 
realist or idealist dream of popu­
lar control.
Above all, when turkey and 
stuffing have pleasantly stuffed us, 
we should be thankful to have 
been born to the American way of 
living which recognizes a person­
ality and which can shape that 
personality to the best use for per­
sonal and public happiness.

The great Wolfgang Mozart was 
baptized with the unlikely name 
of Johannes Chrysostornus Wolf­
gang Theophilus Mozart. In later 
years, he answered to plain Wolf­
gang Mozart. Plenty of reason to 
change such a name!
It was not until Guiseppe Verdi 
Wi«s eighty years old that he wrote 
his first comic opera, “Falstaff.”

out the humor in life.)

Thanksgiving Dance Features 
Stylings by Don Palmer
Only two weeks more to go for 
that big event of the fall season— 
’tis the Thanksgiving Dance on 
November 30. Already things are 
getting underway and we predict 
this first dance of the season will 
truly start off in 
great style. One of 
the Mellow Modes,
Betty Greenwood, 
also Don Palmer’s 
featured soloist, ap­
pears in the picture 
above. Some of the 
former students 
will remember this 
band from the pre­
war days when it 
was one of the fav­
orites at many of 
the big Evening 
School Dances.
Nine till twelve are 
the hours that Don 
Palmer will be 
playing in Thistle 
Hall for this 
T h anksgiving 
Dance.
Just in case there 
are a few quizzical J.f 
students or outsid­
ers who wonder 
what and where -r I •'
Thistle Hall is, let *
us set your mud- I
died mind at ease. |
Thistle Hall is in f
the second floor of 
the Gymnasium |
Building above the 
men’s gym, and the 
ideal place and size 1 / 
for a ballroom. The V
Gymnasium Building, however, is 
located in back of the Fine Arts 
Building and to the left of Mar­
garet Morrison.
So to all you who are interested 
in dancing to the “sweet swing 
music” of Don Palmer’s orchestra, 
we are looking forward to your 
presence in the large turnout an­
ticipated. Tickets are now or sale 
and can be secured from Mr. Mc- 
Kelway, and members of Student 
Council, Plaid Staff, or Social 
Committee.

Another organization new on 
the American scene is American 
Action Inc. which is an arch­
conservative promotional outfit, 
spiritual heir to the late unlament­
ed America First. Its character 
can be read from the fact that 
Gerald L. K. Smith, fascist extra­
ordinary, endorses it.
Although the leaders of Amer­
ica First are not publicly associat­
ed with American Action Inc., in­
formed observers say they are its 
guiding spirits. The financial an­
gels are the same too. American 
Action, although not as objection­
able as the marching-music type 
of “patriotic” organization, is more 
dangerous for that very reason. 
It is conceivable that American 
Action could drum up a big mem­
bership, then squash many of our 
personal rights. Indeed, in three 
western states the closed shop

tion, violating labor’s bargaining

floating around the Fine Arts,

school, that if properly integrated, 
could match and even surpass any 
liberal arts course offered at col­
leges that specialize in that de­
partment. Even though the cur­
riculum would be comparatively 
easy, the academic standards of 
the school would not be lowered 
and at the same time the name
