T’S mighty easy to think of Commencement as the 
end of everything that’s care-free and pleasant. But\ don’t make that mistake.
The cold, gray world after college isn’t so cold and gray to the fellow that tackles it in the right spirit.
Of course, it isn’t going to pay you a ,fat salary nght at the start-off. That isn’t the way it doès things.' Instead, it is . going to put you through .a. testing and % seasoning process which will measure your grit- and your stamina and find out whether you’re a dependable performer. s
^ Once you’ve proved your dependability, you’ll get re- < sponsibOity and with responsibility-xomes income. And

In the meantime build your reputation of top-quality materials« "Team up with, the best in every job you .. handle.. Stand for, fight for the best materials, the best

I ' (Reserve ‘Weekly) ¦
Some fifteen or sixteen,.college students.îjave 
committed suicide in the pest few weeks.
The suicides con be counted, but the gener­
alizations which they have generated (
The sorriest aspect of the matter is the ten­
dency of some col)cge'profes6qrs to generalize, 
with little more basis than in the illustration 
given above/oil tHe current college generation.
‘That most of these generalizations concern de­
merits rather than merits does not help much. 
AVe should like to point out in passing, that it 
has .been our experience that most of the under­
graduates -who inspire these- generalizations 
think they are true—about the rest of the stu­
dents.
