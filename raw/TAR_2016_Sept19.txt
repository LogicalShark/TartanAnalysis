Hundreds of people 
gathered in Wiegand Gym-
nasium on Friday afternoon 
to attend the senatorial cam-
paign rally for Democratic 
candidate Katie McGinty. 
McGinty was joined by sev-
eral other notable guests, 
including Braddock Mayor 
John Fetterman and Senator 
Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
As a member of the United 
States Senate, McGinty 
promises to take a stance on 
protecting the environment, 
defending women’s rights, 
and supporting middle class 
families. Having served as 
former Chief of Staff to Gov-
ernor Tom Wolf, in addition 
to serving as Secretary of the 
Pennsylvania Department of 
Environmental Protection, 
McGinty has an undeniably 
impressive track record. 
Despite the fact that she has 
never held political of?ce, 
McGinty has proved herself to 
be a competitive candidate, 
with polls indicating that 
she is currently neck-to-neck 
with her biggest rival, Re-
publican Senator Pat Toomey 
who has held a seat in Penn-
sylvania since 2011. McGinty 
has also been endorsed by 
heavyweight Democrats on 
Capitol Hill, including both 
President Barack Obama and 
Vice President Joe Biden, as 
well as Senator Bob Casey 
(D-PA) and Senator Elizabeth 
Warren (D-MA).
McGinty’s role in this 
senatorial election cycle is 
crucial. If she is elected into 
the United States Senate, 
not only would she be the 
?rst-ever female senator to 
represent the state of Penn-
sylvania, but her win would 
also be a major victory for 
the Democratic Party. The 
Democratic Party needs to 
reclaim ?ve senatorial seats 
to restore a majority, and se-
curing Pennsylvania could 
be a near determinant factor 
to take back the Senate from 
the Republican Party. With 
the country witnessing a 
presidential election that has 
proven to be unpredictable, 
to say the least, the result of 
this senatorial election cycle 
is critical.
Emmett Eldred, a senior 
English and Philosophy 
double major and co-founder 
of Carnegie Mellon’s Col-
lege Democrats organization 
kicked off the event with an 
enthusiastic introduction 
that seemed to rile up antici-
pation and excitement among 
members of the crowd. Pitts-
burgh City Councilman and 
Carnegie Mellon alum Dan 
Gilman also expressed his 
support for McGinty before 
welcoming John Fetterman 
to the stage.
Fetterman was an ideal 
choice to introduce McGinty, 
considering that his posi-
tion as the mayor of Brad-
dock and as somewhat of a 
local celebrity could help the 
campaign appeal to the lo-
cal demographic. He left the 
audience laughing with sev-
eral pop culture references, 
while also criticizing Senator 
Pat Toomey. In one of his re-
marks, Fetterman described 
Toomey’s questionable rela-
tionship with Donald Trump 
as, “the greatest love story 
since The Notebook.” Despite 
facing McGinty as an oppo-
nent in the primaries earlier 
this year, Fetterman showed 
his full support for her cam-
paign. Fetterman stated “I

On Saturday, Oct. 8, 
Pittsburgh men will walk a 
mile in women’s shoes as they 
participate in the second an-
nual Walk a Mile in Her Shoes 
PGH.
According to the organiza-
tion’s website, Walk a Mile in 
Her Shoes is an international 
march that advocates to end 
rape, sexual assault, and 
gender violence. Participants 
in this movement wear high 
heels while walking for one 
mile as a way to raise aware-
ness about the severity of 
these issues towards women. 
This event will take place in 
Pittsburgh at 5050 Liberty Av-
enue at 4:30 p.m. with a rally 
followed by the walk. The 
proceeds of this fundraiser 
will bene?t the Pittsburgh 
Action Against Rape (PAAR) 
organization.
“This walk really is so im-
portant to have in a society 
like ours,” the Chair of Walk a 
Mile PGH Camille Goleb said. 
“Our society still tends to, for 
whatever reason, focus on the 
actions of the victim rather 
than the actions of the at-
tacker. Things like that are re-
ally unacceptable, and events 
like this bring the attention to 
where it needs to be, which 
is prevention, education and 
discussions about consent.”
Historically, a huge focus 
of this event has been to pre-
vent sexual assault through 
the actions of men, instead 
of having women focus on 
preventing getting raped. 
Walk a Mile in Her Shoes was 
founded by Frank Baird in 
2001 and initially started with 
just a few men trying to make 
a statement. Now, Baird’s 
idea is practiced worldwide 
and makes millions of dollars 
for numerous programs that 
help support victims of sexual 
assault.
The Pittsburgh chapter 
of Walk a Mile in Her Shoes 
was started by Goleb after she 
moved here over a year ago 
and was disappointed that 
there were no annual events 
to spread awareness about 
sexual assault and support its 
victims. Goleb said that the 
city’s overall reception of the 
walk has been very positive.
“The event itself is 
supposed to be a little 
light-hearted, so most of our 
participants have felt happy, if 
not a little blistered and sore, 
after the walk,” Goleb said. “I 
most enjoy the impact of the 
rally on all of the participants. 
We usually have a survivor 
speak at the rally, and have 
lots of organizations tabling 
and providing resources not 
only for survivors, but for the 
community as a whole.”
These organizations at 
the walk are representatives 
of the many resources Pitts-
burgh has for survivors of 
sexual assault, including the 
PAAR organization. The orga-
nizers of the walk decided to 
have the money raised go to 
PAAR because of their positive 
reputation regarding educa-
tion and advocacy of victims 
of sexualized violence.
Another way the event 
is being personalized for 
Pittsburgh is that after the 
walk there will be music by 
several local artists from 7 
p.m. until midnight. These 
performances will happen at 
the Bloom?eld Bridge Tavern 
and the Howlers. College stu-
dents in the area can also get 
involved in this event.
“College students can get 
involved in this event right 
away,” Goleb said. “I highly 
encourage teams of Walk-
ers to register. You can walk, 
wear a crazy out?t to unify 
your team, come to the rally, 
come to the concert, anything 
that you can.”
This walk is another way 
for college students to ac-
knowledge the prevalence 
of sexual assault on campus. 
According to the website for 
the Rape, Abuse and Incest 
National Network (RAINN), 
“11.2 percent of all students 
[on college campuses] expe-
rience rape or sexual assault 
through physical force, vio-
lence, or incapacitation.” This 
includes both undergraduate 
and graduate students. The 
massive number of college 
students impacted by this is 
another reason why the walk 
is so important.
Both males and females 
can sign up for the walk, and 
as for the guys who have nev-
er walked in heels, Goleb says 
not to worry.
“For those that aren’t used 
to walking in heels, we’ll have 
a coach at the rally to show 
you the ropes,” Goleb said. “I 
can’t wait to see everyone’s 
strut.”

New Facebook study shows that online interaction can improve a person’s mood
A new study conducted 
by Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity and Facebook shows 
that personal interactions 
on Facebook have a positive 
impact on a person’s feelings. 
In particular, researchers say 
that personalized comments 
and posts from loved ones 
have been shown to solicit 
as much satisfaction from a 
person as getting married or 
having a baby.
Moira Burke, a Facebook 
research scientist and hu-
man-computer interaction 
PhD graduate, and Robert 
Kraut, a professor at Carn-
egie Mellon’s Human Com-
puter Interaction Institute, 
conducted the three month-
long study. The duo asked 
1,910 Facebook users from 
91 countries to take a month-
ly survey in which they were 
asked about their Face-
book behavior. Burke and 
Kraut found that within a 
month, sixty comments from 
close friends affected one’s 
psychological well-being, 
concluding that Facebook 
interactions can increase 
satisfaction and happiness.
Burke and Kraut’s study 
does, however, contradict 
previous studies that have 
shown that time spent on 
social media is associated 
with a greater likelihood of 
loneliness and depression. 
Burke and Kraut’s study has 
shown that personal social 
media interactions help to 
combat said negative feel-
ings, with Burke suggesting 
that these interactions help 
remind people of their loved 
ones and positive in?uences 
in their lives.
“We’re not talking about 
anything that’s particularly 
labor-intensive,” Burke said 
in a university press release. 
“This can be a comment 
that’s just a sentence or two. 
The important thing is that 
someone such as a close 
friend takes the time to per-
sonalize it. The content may 
be uplifting, and the mere act 
of communication reminds 
recipients of the meaningful 
relationships in their lives.”

DOMINIQUE ESCANDO
Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escando is the Cabinet Writer 
of The Student Government. 
Last weekend Vaasavi 
Unnava (SBP), Aaron Gutier-
rez (SBVP), and  Arnelle Eti-
enne, advocacy chair of the 
President’s Cabinet, hosted 
the ?rst-ever Conference for 
Social Change at Carnegie 
Mellon. The event consisted 
of a grouping of discussions 
among selected moderators 
and student organization 
presidents that focused on 
prominent issues students 
face, such as race relations 
or civic engagement, for 
the goal of catalyzing ideas 
and initiatives to improve 
on-campus life.
Although one organization 
with the most creative initia-
tive will receive a $2,000 
reward at the end of the year, 
Vaasavi and Aaron hope each 
participating organization is 
able to ?nd unique encour-
agement in knowing that they 
are helping create a better and 
safer campus for their friends, 
the following generations of 
their organization, and the 
entire Carnegie Mellon stu-
dent body. From the perspec-
tive of Student Government, 
this conference was a 
beginning — the beginning 
of a year where students feel 
equally ful?lled with initi-
ating and creating tangible 
change in how students ap-
proach Sexual Assault and 
Relationship Violence Pre-
vention (SARVP) as they do 
when their Mousetrap Car ?-
nally works perfectly, or their 
poem leaves a room speech-
less. It’s the beginning of a 
year where we aren’t scared 
to reach out to a friend who is 
struggling under the premise 
that taking this initiative can 
possibly take up too much 
time. It’s the beginning of a 
rede?nition of putting your 
heart in the work, where work 
doesn’t only mean research 
or classes.
Why were student 
organization leaders chosen? 
Organizations are the heart 
of the spirit of Carnegie 
Mellon. They’ve certainly 
done enough to earn that rec-
ognition by how they serve 
as microcosms of the varied 
interests and backgrounds of 
our students and introduce 
fun and extracurricular pride 
into our lives. Student organi-
zation presidents, in particu-
lar, have been chosen, usually 
by popular vote, to represent 
and lead their organizations 
to maintain and supersede 
their past successes. If 
Carnegie Mellon wishes to 
complete a particular goal, 
student organizations are 
the place to go.
What might be the most 
important question discussed 
at this event was: what is an 
initiative? Arnelle Etienne has 
de?ned it as “a [measurable] 
program or series of events 
created by a student orga-
nization for the purpose of 
creating change on campus,” 
which Aaron later expanded 
to “anything that has the pur-
pose of advancing their cho-
sen cause.” In these two de?-
nitions, two qualities stand 
out: choice and action. From 
RPG to business leadership to 
Booth & Buggy efforts, each 
of the many organizations on 
campus has such varied goals 
and activities, so it should be 
up to these organizations to 
de?ne what need they will 
focus on and how they will 
create change on campus. Be 
it a speaker series, a drive, 
or anything else imaginable 
and productive, an initiative 
involves joint and repeated 
effort by members for some-
thing they care about that 
bene?ts the community. Vaas-
avi, Aaron, and Arnelle really 
look forward to seeing what’s 
possible, and knowing Carn-
egie Mellon students, those 
possibilities are limitless.

know ?rst hand better than 
anybody just how capable, 
how intelligent, how commit-
ted [McGinty] is to standing 
up for Pennsylvania’s middle 
class families.”
An eruption of cheers and 
chanting welcomed McGinty 
as she took the stage and invit-
ed her supporters to join her 
in “[shattering] the glass ceil-
ing in the United States Sen-
ate.” Her speech commenced 
with negative appraisals 
of Senator Toomey, criti-
cizing his support towards 
Wall Street corporations, his 
failure to stay loyal to his 
constituents, and his stance 
against college affordability. 
McGinty also addressed pit-
falls of the American Dream, 
claiming that while Ameri-
cans continue to work hard, 
the current political system 
keeps them from getting 
ahead. As the audience 
stirred in agreement, she 
continued, “any person giv-
ing it their all is deserving 
of our dignity and respect,” 
referring mainly to workers 
being paid minimum wage. 
She added, “your zip code is 
not your destiny,” an expres-
sion that Fetterman has also 
used liberally throughout his 
tenure as mayor of Braddock, 
where median household in-
come and education statistics 
are notoriously low.
As McGinty made her 
concluding remarks, the 
crowd started buzzing in 
anticipation and ?nally ex-
ploded into uproar when 
Senator Bernie Sanders took 
the stage. This came as no 
surprise given his popular-
ity among millennials dur-
ing this presidential election 
cycle, which earned him the 
reputation as the leading 
progressive voice of the coun-
try. The former presidential 
candidate asserted that, “The 
future agenda of the United 
States of America may well 
rest on the results of this 
election, which is why we 
need Katie McGinty in the 
United States Senate.” He 
maintained the stance he 
took on many issues during 
his own campaign, including 
the need to reclaim the coun-
try’s wealth from the “top one 
percent.” It has become evi-
dent that Senator Sanders has 
an undeniable talent when 
it comes to appealing to his 
supporters, and his participa-
tion in McGinty’s campaign 
could prove to hold a signi?-
cant advantage over Senator 
Toomey. The event came to 
a close with Senator Sand-
ers’ forceful reminder that, 
“We are not a poor nation. 
We are the richest nation in 
the history of the world. Our 
job is to elect Katie and Sec-
retary Clinton. Our job is to 
transform the United States 
of America.”

Carnegie Mellon University 
is leading the charge to-
wards eliminating the gen-
der gap in STEM fields with 
nearly 50 percent of this 
year’s first-year undergradu-
ates for the School of Com-
puter Science and College 
of Engineering consisting of 
women. While the nation-
al average of women with 
degrees in computer sci-
ence and engineering fields 
has remained stagnant at 
around 20 percent through-
out the years, Carnegie Mel-
lon University has managed 
to increase the percentage of 
females within their School 
of Computer Science from 
seven percent to now more 
than 48 percent within the 
span of a decade.
Having claimed the title 
as the number one university 
to combat the STEM gender 
gap according to a ranking 
conducted by Her Campus, 
Carnegie Mellon University 
attributes this exponential 
increase in female enroll-
ment towards a deliberate 
attempt to seek out more 
diversity, a nurturing and 
encouraging academic envi-
ronment, and early outreach 
programs for students in 
high school and even mid-
dle school. Diversifying the 
composition of the student 
body enables the introduc-
tion of new and potentially 
revolutionary ideas. In a 
University press release, Jim 
Garrett, dean of the College 
of Engineering, remarked 
that, “Not only is this the 
right thing to do, it is impor-
tant to have diverse perspec-
tives included to improve 
the performance and results 
of engineering processes.” 
Garrett is one of many 
faculty members to share 
an appreciation for a com-
munity focused on enabling 
those who have seldom had 
the opportunity to flourish.
A multitude of 
organizations exist on cam-
pus dedicated to helping 
women pursue their pas-
sions and develop the nec-
essary skills to leave a last-
ing impact on society. From 
encouraging nervous first-
year students for upcoming 
exams, to providing young 
undergraduate students 
mentorship, WinECE (Wom-
en in Electrical Computer 
Engineering at Carnegie 
Mellon University) is one 
of the many support groups 
available to women in need 
of assistance. Besides en-
suring that all students feel 
comfortable and accepted, 
Carnegie Mellon University 
emphasizes the importance 
of collaboration. In a recent 
University press release,

New disease carried by mosquitos detected in Haiti
University of Florida 
researchers have recently dis-
covered a mosquito-borne virus 
that had not been previously 
reported in Brazil.
Categorized as a Mayaro 
virus, it originated from one of 
the blood samples collected by 
faculty from the University of 
Florida Emerging Pathogens 
Institute during and after a 
viral epidemic occurred a 
few years ago on the island of 
Hispaniola. 
The virus came from an 
eight-year-old boy in rural Hai-
ti who demonstrated fever and 
abdominal pain.
A reverse transcription 
polymerase reaction was done 
to genetically identify the new 
virus in the sample. 
According to John Lednicky, 
an associate professor at the 
University of Florida and lead 
author of the study, it is uncer-
tain whether the virus origi-
nated from Haiti, or was a ge-
netic hybrid of different types 
of Mayaro virus.

Control and Prevention’s

Uber debuts self-driving vehicles in city of Pittsburgh
Last Wednesday, Uber 
launched its self-driving pilot 
program in Pittsburgh.
For the past year, Uber 
has kept a low pro?le on its 
development of autonomous 
cars. The work took place at 
the Advanced Technologies 
Center, which has recruited 
Carnegie Mellon University 
researchers and faculty, in 
addition to partnering with 
automakers including Volvo. 
The ultimate goal is to have 
the autonomous vehicles re-
place much of the company’s 
1.5 million drivers, while tak-
ing lead in the car business 
industry.
Each self-driving vehicle is 
a Ford Fusion equipped with 
3D cameras, global position-
ing systems (GPS), and lasers 
that measure the shape and 
distance of objects. 
As the car navigates to 
the customer’s destination, a 
driver and engineer are physi-
cally present to take control 
when needed. According to 
experts, more research and 
development still need to be 
done before autonomous cars 
can become widespread on 
roads.

Honeycreepers, Kauai’s native bird, nearing extinction
According to a new study 
in Science Advances, the dis-
appearance of Kauaian hon-
eycreepers could mean an 
extinction of multiple hon-
eycreeper species in the 
Hawaiian Islands within the 
next decade.
After arriving to the 
Hawaiian Islands millions of 
years ago, the ancestors of 
the ?nch-like birds had pro-
liferated into more than 50 
diverse species, an evolution-
ary phenomenon that has long 
captivated many scientists. 
The decline in honeycreepers 
can be attributed to a rise in 
temperature, which has har-
bored the spread of mosqui-
to-borne diseases, including 
avian malaria and avian pox-
virus. The honeycreepers also 
have a more dif?cult time ?nd-
ing food due to competition 
with other birds foreign to the 
islands, as well as the presence 
of invasive plants. 
However, avian scientists 
believe the birds could po-
tentially be saved through 
advanced mosquito control 
techniques, which may be 
effective but challenging to 
implement.

Scientists suggest conception without eggs can occur
A recent publication in 
Nature Communications sug-
gests that in the distant future, 
eggs may not be necessary for 
making babies. Researchers at 
the University of Bath applied 
chemicals to transform an 
unfertilized mouse egg into a 
pseudo-embryo. 
Sperm was then injected 
into the pseudo-embryos, 
which led to successful preg-
nancies in 25 percent of the 
mouse experiments. Addition-
ally, the mice born from the 
experiments were found to 
be normal and healthy, and 
were also able to make healthy 
offspring themselves.
Since a pseudo-embryo 
replicates and monitors the 
DNA much like ordinary cells, 
scientists believe that it is pos-
sible to produce a baby by 
combining ordinary cells from 
the body with sperm to form 
human embryos.
The study has allowed 
scientists to learn more about 
the enigmatic mechanisms 
behind fertilization. Further-
more, it could lead to more 
knowledge on ways to repro-
gram the fate of cells during 
the early development of life.

Movement of atoms may lead to better superconductors
At the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, phys-
icists were able to lower the 
temperature of a potassium 
gas very close to absolute 
zero. The cool gas was then 
contained inbetween a two-
dimensional, laser-generated 
lattice.
For the ?rst time, high-
resolution microscopic im-
ages were taken of the atoms 
as they interacted with the 
lattice. In studying the posi-
tions of the atoms, the re-
searchers were astonished to 
see that in areas of high gas 
compression, atoms displayed 
alternating magnetic orienta-
tions. They also discovered 
that pairs of atoms tend to 
form next to empty spaces in 
the lattice.
From studying the pecu-
liar behavior of the atoms, 
the physicists were able to 
learn more about supercon-
ducting behavior. Knowing 
how to induce superconduc-

Astronomers unveil most detailed map of Milky Way galaxy
With data collected by a 
billion-pixel camera on a Gaia 
probe, a robotic spacecraft 
launched by the European 
Space Agency a few years 
ago, astronomers were able 
to create the currently largest 
and most detailed map of the 
Milky Way.
The map, which was 
published online last week, 
features visual information of 
the positions and brightness 
of more than 1.1 billion stars, 
accounting for one percent of 
stars estimated to be in the 
Milky Way.
The data will enable 
astronomers to develop a 
three-dimensional map of the 
galaxy, which will improve 
astronomers’ understanding 
of the distribution and move-
ment of stars across space. 
Additionally, astronomers 
can use the data to identify 
new planets outside the solar 
system and to see how planets 
are distributed in relation to  
parent stars. The latter could 
lead to better knowledge of 
planetary formation.

Self-driving vehicles raise multiple ethical quandaries

As technology evolves, 
the ability for machines to 
create a user experience that 
imitates human-human in-
teraction also evolves. Voice 
recognition software, used 
to carry out commands or to 
take note of information said 
by the user, is crucial to that 
experience. Software such as 
Siri and Cortana (even with 
its questionable accuracy) are 
undoubtedly powerful pieces 
of work that are able to create 
unique, customized user ex-
periences based primarily on 
verbal input.
Voice recognition software 
works via a complicated pro-
cess. The audio input, in the 
form of analog input, is ?rst 
converted to a digital input 
using an Analog-to-Digital 
Converter (ADC). 
During this process, the 
background noise is also ?l-
tered from the input, stabi-
lized to a constant volume 
level, and slowed or sped up 
to match that of the software.
This 
digital, 
clean ver-
sion is then 
fragmented 
into segments 
that may last only 
up to a hundredth of 
a second based on the 
sounds that they contain. 
These short sounds match 
to phonemes in the set lan-
guage. Phonemes are the 
most basic parts of the lan-
guage; they are the sounds 
that combine to form words, 
such as ‘p’ or ‘t’.
Cleaning and slicing the 
input is signi?cantly easier 
than trying to decipher the 
content of the phoneme-
match with reference to the 
input’s context. 
Early voice recognition 
software used rule-based sys-
tems to convert digital data 
to meaningful sentences. The 
problem with those systems 
was their obvious need to ad-
here to standard input. 
Slang and people’s differ-
ent sentence structures were 
dif?cult to recognize. Even 
just continuous conversa-
tional input without pauses 
after every input was hard 
to detect. 
In order to overcome these 
challenges, today’s voice rec-
ognition software employs 
sophisticated statistical mod-
eling algorithms to predict 
the most likely and most sen-
sible outcome for the input. 
An older, similarity-based 
algorithm was the dynamic 
time warping algorithm that, 
simplistically put, optimally 
matched short segments 
based on similarity of a par-
ticular characteristic. 
Today, the Hidden Mar-
kov model is the most used 
algorithm because of its 
accuracy, 
compu-
tational 
feasibility, 
simplicity, and 
ability to be trained 
automatically.  Like 
a typical learning pro-
gram, this algorithm as-
signs probability scores to a 
given input based on the pre-
determined set of words and 
training data. Given that most 
programs have 60,000 words, 
which makes trillions of word 
combinations possible to 
form a sentence, it is indeed 
a signi?cantly important 
issue to reduce the number of 
possibilities to a reasonable 
set of accurate possibilities.
Although voice recognition 
software is pretty sophisticat-
ed today, there are limitations 
to its functional performance. 
For example, even with all 
the new, though questionably 
cool, features in the iPhone7, 
there is one thing that’s still 
missing — the ability for Siri 
to recognize puns. 
One pretty obvious point 
of confusion is homonyms. 
Words that sound the same, 
such as ‘hair’ and ‘hare’, or 
’bald’ and ‘bawled,’ can pro-
duce really interesting mis-
interpretations. Other limita-
tions include low signal-noise 
ratios, overlapping speech, 
and the need for heavy 
computational power.
In terms of user 
experience, voice recognition 
can be used for home automa-
tion, in-car control, military 
vehicle operation, and even 
our very own J.A.R.V.I.S. 
Besides the fact that voice 
recognition allows for fantas-
tic new user experiences, it 
can be used for a variety of 
other purposes.
Language learning, pro-
nunciation practice, and, 
one day, maybe even uni-
versal translators, are fabu-
lous new ways to harness all 
this potential.
Voice recognition systems 
have also been employed 
for people with disabilities 
and injuries. 
Thus, voice recognition, 
though sophisticated, is set 
to become an integral part of 
the next 50 years, with all the 
potential bene?ts it offers.

As self-driving cars move 
rapidly from fantasies into 
our current reality, there are 
ethical questions surrounding 
their use that we haven’t had 
to consider until now.
Machines that make 
decisions have been around 
for quite a while, but civil-
ians have not had access to 
autonomous machines with 
the destructive capacity of 
automobiles. When cars col-
lide with either stationary 
objects or other cars, there is 
usually severe damage done 
to everything involved in the 
crash. Since these situations 
arise for unpredictable rea-
sons, there has to be an ethi-
cal framework for the cars to 
make decisions and for who 
is liable when the cars do 
damage.
The ?rst question that has 
to be answered is who does 
the car prioritize when it 
has to decide who lives and 
who dies.
Ethically, this is a complex 
question.
A purely consequentialist 
car will decide what course 
of action is most likely to save 
the most people, but this cal-
culation is affected by many 
factors. 
It may never be possible 
to preemptively tell code ex-
actly who is inside or outside 
the car, how likely that person 
would be to survive a colli-
sion, and many other relevant 
pieces of information within 
the time that the car could 
respond to the crash.
A car that is more ethically 
focused on the decision rather 
than the result would have 
to have a consistent process 
for determining its reaction 
to each potential crash. 
Any process will be subject 
not only to ethical skepti-
cism but also the individual 
needs of each person and 
each collision. 
Someone’s biography and 
relationships to the people 
around them might also be-
come relevant in ways that are 
hard or impossible to get the 
car to respond to. If parents 
were dropping their kids off 
at school and those kids run 
into the street in front of that 
car, parents would probably 
want their car to avoid their 
own kid and a person possibly 
could make that reaction, but 
a car likely cannot.
Most manufacturers of 
self-driving cars have decided 
to prioritize the driver’s safety 
in every situation. The most 
obvious justi?cation for this 
is that if a consumer has to 
choose between two cars and 
one is more likely to kill them, 
they will almost certainly 
choose the one that they are 
less likely to die in. 
This is a market force and 
not an ethical decision, but it 
has some merit. If everyone 
on the road was in a car that 
prioritized its own driver’s 
safety, cars would be very 
predictable in their responses 
to unexpected obstacles and 
people on the road would 
more likely be safe in ac-
cidents because everyone’s 
car is preserving their own 
safety. In collisions with pe-
destrians, the pedestrian is 
in danger, but pedestrians 
move very slowly compared 
to cars and are easier to safely 
avoid entirely.
Either way, this process 
has to be universal so cars do 
not have individual decision-
making processes. Otherwise, 
cars would be unpredictable, 
leading to more collisions. 
Further, corporations have 
a pro?t incentive, not a pub-
lic bene?t incentive, so the 
decision-making process is in 
better hands if it is universal 
and made outside the 
corporate environment.
Another question that 
surrounds self-driving cars 
is liability; if a self-driving 
car gets into an accident, 
who is responsible?
Pugwash was unanimous 
that collisions between fully 
autonomous vehicles should 
be the responsibility of the 
companies who designed the 
driving algorithms for the 
cars involved. 
Firstly, their processes for 
driving are what failed and 
caused the collision. 
Secondly, this gives those 
companies easy access to data 
points that they can use to im-
prove their algorithms, and 
legal pressure and investiga-
tions could ensure increased 
safety of self-driving cars.
Semi-autonomous vehicles 
were more of a gray area. 
Semi-autonomous vehicles 
often have instruction manu-
als telling the driver to be 
aware and to take control of 
the car if necessary. This could 
lead to more user error when 
people crash a car that would 
have otherwise gotten itself 
out of the situation, but it also 
means people are responsible 
for being the failsafe for their 
own vehicle. 
Pedestrians can also cause 
collisions by being negligent 
in how they cross the street. 
The current process of deter-
mining fault is probably the 
best way to deal with this.
Changes in technology 
often introduce a new context 
for ethical questions, and au-
tomating something with as 
much potential for damage 
as driving cars makes those 
questions very relevant. 
Making sure these 
questions get answered, or 
at least acknowledged, is key 
to ensuring that the future 
of self-driving cars is pur-
sued responsibly by both car 
companies and car owners.Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational orga-
nization that discusses the 
implications of science. This ar-
ticle is a summary of last week’s 
discussion on self-driving cars.India Price/Online Editor

Star Trek celebrates 50 years of inspiring young minds
EVANGELINE LIU
Junior Staffwriter
The human mind has 
pushed beyond the limits of 
gravity and our atmosphere 
through science ?ction long 
before technology started 
catching up in the 1960s. 
Star Trek in particular, 
which celebrates its 50th an-
niversary this year since its 
release in 1966, allowed the 
imaginations of millions to 
?y beyond the borders of 
concrete science.
Taking the good and bad 
of human nature and ex-
panding it out by light-years 
with the help of advanced 
technologies, some of which 
have since come to reality and 
some of which still only ex-
ist in our creative minds, Star 
Trek continues to inspire peo-
ple of every ?eld, including 
many at Carnegie Mellon.
For The New York Times 
best-selling author Daniel Wil-
son, who earned his Ph.D in 
robotics at Carnegie Mellon’s 
Robotics Institute in 2005, the 
themes in his science ?ction 
stories parallel the ones in the 
Star Trek universe. The tech-
nology in both is a medium to 
convey the greater underly-
ing themes of the literature or 
artwork itself.
In a university press 
release, Wilson said, “Inspira-
tion can come from anywhere, 
a pretty sounding word, an 
intriguing new technology or 
an image that comes to mind 
during a certain song.”
Meanwhile, for René 
Auberjonois, who gradu-
ated in 1962 from Carnegie 
Mellon’s School of Drama 
and went on to be an actor in 
the Star Trek universe, being 
part of the Star Trek cast was 
“almost more than one could 
hope for.”
Auberjonois said in the 
same press release, “It’s an 
honor to be even a small 
part of a work of art that has 
touched the lives of so many 
in a positive and hopeful way.”
Auberjonois is not the only 
Carnegie Mellon alumnus 
who is part of the Star Trek 
team. Zachary Quinto, anoth-
er School of Drama alumnus, 
has played Spock three times. 
Mark Worthington, also a 
School of Drama alumnus, is 
the production designer for 
CBS’s new “Star Trek: Discov-
ery,” due to be released online 
in 2017.
At Carnegie Mellon, there 
is even a class on technology 
— offered for science majors 
in the fall as a mini-course 
and as a full semester course 
for all students in the spring 
— that uses examples from 
movies and television shows, 
including Star Trek.
Technology has progressed 
at such a rapid rate that some 
of the technology in Star Trek 
is already real, such as the 
?ctional crewmembers’ hand-
held communication devices, 
which are similar to today’s 
smartphones, or the tablet-
sized computers reminiscent 
of iPads that even have a Siri-
like feature. 
Some pieces of technology 
do not exist quite yet, but 
are close, such as Star Trek’s 
holodeck, which makes 
the user feel like they are 
touching something; however, 
this particular invention is 
similar to a more advanced 
version of current virtual 
reality technology.
Some technologies are 
impossible by today’s stan-
dards, such as the transporter 
devices that move items and 
people thousands of miles 
very quickly in the ?ctional 
universe. 
While Star Trek may be a 
?ctional universe, the tech-
nological advancements are 
very real. One thing that 
will remain certain is that 
works like Star Trek will con-
tinue to inspire our imagina-
tions beyond our physical lim-
itations for many, many years 
to come.

Star Trek continues to inspire people of all ages with its use of futuristic technology. Some of the technology featured in Star Trek, like handheld communication devices and tablet-sized computers, are already in practice today.

For the past few weeks, Donald 
Trump and the media have publicly 
speculated about Hillary Clinton’s 
health. Their speculation reached a 
fever pitch last Sunday when Clin-
ton left a 9/11 memorial event early 
after feeling overheated and cell 
phone footage later showed her ap-
pearing to faint as she was escorted 
into her van. Now, a week later, 
the most recent polls have shown 
Clinton and Trump tied nationally, 
and Trump leads Clinton in the key 
swing states of Florida and Ohio.
To be sure, Clinton’s drop in the 
polls is not due entirely to her pneu-
monia. She also had a bad week in 
terms of her “basket of deplorable” 
gaffes, among other issues. But 
there should be no doubt that Clin-
ton’s campaign has been badly hurt 
by her illness. The truly frustrating 
part of this for Clinton’s campaign 
is that this would be a much small-
er story had Clinton just disclosed 
her illness to begin with. This is an 
ongoing pattern that Clinton must 
overcome to correct her course; 
instead of getting in front of poten-
tially damaging stories, she shrouds 
herself in secrecy, ultimately mak-
ing the story seem much more scan-
dalous when it gets out.
In the case of her health, Clinton 
should have disclosed her pneumo-
nia as soon as she was diagnosed 
with it, which was Friday, Sept. 9. 
Doing so would have at least two 
bene?ts. First, she would have qui-
eted much of the preexisting specu-
lation about her health, which of-
ten centered around coughing ?ts 
that would easily be explained by a 
pneumonia diagnosis. Second, had 
Clinton disclosed her pneumonia 
and then still attended the 9/11 me-
morial, she would have likely ben-
e?ted from extra positive optics.
Instead, by hiding her pneu-
monia, Clinton let the speculation 
about her health rage on. She pub-
licly exhibited signs of poor health 
that added to the ?re, and she re-
inforced the narrative that she isn’t 
transparent with the American pub-
lic. Now, many Americans worry 
that Clinton is neither healthy nor 
honest enough 
to serve as 
President.
Clinton’s 
desire for 
privacy, 
while understandable, has caused 
her campaign great harm, and is at 
the center of what makes her poll 
numbers so abysmal on the metric 
of “honest and trustworthy”.
The most haunting example for 
her campaign has been Clinton’s use 
of a private email server while work-
ing in the State Department. Clinton 
used such a server out of a desire to 
circumvent public disclosure laws, 
which would have required her to 
preserve every email she sent or re-
ceived as Secretary of State for pub-
lic record. Because of her af?nity for 
secrecy, her email activity has blown 
up into a huge scandal that has be-
come one of the de?ning issues of 
the campaign, and a persistent drag 
on her favorability.
Another example is Clinton’s 
aversion to press conferences. Be-
cause Clinton distrusts the press 
and believes that too much press 
exposure will lead to negative cov-
erage, she went nine months with-
out holding a press conference. She 
broke her silence only two weeks 
ago, holding a press conference for 
the ?rst time since before any of the 
primary elections had even begun. 
Because she refused to hold press 
conferences for want of privacy, the 
press instead wrote negative stories 
about her refusing to speak to them. 
Once again, her desire for secrecy 
ended up creating an even bigger 
and more negative story than the 
one she was trying to avoid and re-
inforced an image of dishonesty.
This is not to say that Donald 
Trump is a bastion of honesty or 
transparency. For instance, he is the 
?rst presidential candidate since 
1972 not to release his income tax 
returns, and he has been just as 
withholding on matters of his own 
health. There are clear signs of 
wrongdoing involved with his chari-
table foundation, and he has the 
lowest truthfulness rating on Politi-
fact of any major political ?gure. 
However, this ultimately isn’t going 
to exonerate Clinton of the need to 
become more transparent. The sad 
reality is that the public views her as 
less honest, trustworthy, and trans-
parent than Trump, and every gaffe, 
scandal, and lie hurts her politically 
far more than him.
We can, and should, cry foul 
about a media double standard. We 
can, and should, debate how much 
of the public’s greater distrust of 
Clinton is due to her gender. But 
with only seven weeks remaining in 
the election, Clinton must acknowl-
edge the political hand she’s been 
dealt, and she must adjust. If she 
wants to defeat Donald Trump, (and 
we should all hope that she does!) 
she must become more transpar-
ent, or every small story she tries 
to hide will continue to become a 
monstrous issue that harms her 
wounded campaign.

Clinton secrets kill trust, presidential prospects

Universities must reckon with histories of racism

In 1838, the Jesuit priests who ran 
what is now called Georgetown Uni-
versity sold off 272 slaves. The sale, 
estimated to be worth around $3.3 
million in today’s dollars, helped to 
pay off the then struggling univer-
sity’s debt. While something like this 
is obviously horri?c by today’s stan-
dards, the size and circumstances of 
the sale made it controversial even at 
the time. 
The 272 people sold included 
women, children, and the elderly. 
Little to no concern was paid to the 
conditions the slaves were being sold 
into. Rev. Thomas F. Mulledy, then 
the president of Georgetown Uni-
versity, made promises that the 
slaves would be sold in such a 
way that no families would be 
separated, and that they’d be 
sold to plantations where 
they’d be allowed to con-
tinue their Christian faith. 
None of these promises 
were kept.
Recently, student 
protests have occurred 
on Georgetown’s campus about the 
sale. Students staged a sit-in outside 
the university president’s of?ce, 
wanting to start a conversation on 
this speci?c issue and how the in-
stitution of slavery bene?tted the 
school in general. Principal among 
their grievances was an on-campus 
building — Mulledy Hall, named 
after the ex-president who arranged 
the sale. These protests have com-
pelled Georgetown University to re-
visit this dark chapter in its history. 
Alumni got involved as well, and the 
Georgetown Memory Project was set 
up to track down the descendants of 
the 272 sold. 
The university also removed the 
names of Mulledy and the Rev. Wil-
liam McSherry, another college pres-
ident involved in the sale, from the 
buildings named after them. They 
have rechristened these buildings 
Freedom Hall and Remembrance 
Hall until more permanent names 
can be decided upon. 
Most importantly, however, the 
university has publicly apologized 
for the entire episode, and has of-
fered preferential admissions treat-
ment to the descendants of those 
slaves. In the process, Georgetown 
says its aim is to tackle its sordid his-
tory with slavery head on and start a 
conversation on this issue on college 
campuses across the country.
The public response to this apol-
ogy has been decidedly mixed. On 
one side, Georgetown University has 
been praised for its humility and for 
attempting to trace the lineage of 
families that were separated centu-
ries ago. On the other, the university 
has been criticized for missing the 
proverbial forest for the trees. While 
the move is a step in the right direc-
tion for the descendants of the 272 
slaves directly concerned here, it 
completely sidesteps the larger issue 
of the university’s attitude towards 
slavery in the 19th century. Fur-
ther, several of the slaves’ descen-
dants and the protesting students 
have wondered why they 
hadn’t been included in the 
decision-mak-
ing process. The apology 
was deemed meaningless, 
and the university has been ac-
cused of not following it up with any 
real action. 
If the issue is one of reconciliation 
and reparations, what does the uni-
versity really sacri?ce in an apology 
and a tweaked admissions policy?
It is The Tartan’s view that 
Georgetown University’s so called 
atonement for its 1838 sins is a step 
in the right direction; that being said, 
by isolating the descendants and 
protestors from the decision making 
process, the university is ignoring 
the very people it is trying to serve. 
As such, the apology and surround-
ing actions don’t go nearly as far as 
they need to. While these steps will 
probably succeed at starting a con-
versation around the issue of slavery 
reparations in general, it isn’t nearly 
enough. The lack of meaningful con-
crete steps will leave any amount of 
debate seeming hollow. Addition-
ally, this case makes for an interest-
ing study in how older universities 
around the country should respond 
to their checkered pasts regarding 
slavery, segregation, and racism.
The student activists and slave 
descendants have novel ideas for 
how reparations can be dealt with, 
but Georgetown isn’t currently pay-
ing enough attention. The student 
activists propose a new endowment 
fund that would equal the current 
value of the pro?t garnered from the 
272 slaves in order to recruit black 
professors. This idea is ingenious 
in how it acknowledges the link be-
tween the horrors of 19th century 
slavery and racial injustice today. 
In the true spirit of reparations, it 
manages to provide tangible bene?t 
without talking down to the af?icted 
communities. It successfully uses the 
case of the 272 slaves as a platform 
to tackle the issue of reparations for 
slavery at a much broader scale than 
what the university just announced.
Several of the slaves’ descendants 
are suggesting something that is far 
more radical. They are calling for a 
billion dollar reconciliation fund 
that they want Georgetown 
to spearhead the creation 
of. This move has been 
misunderstood and 
mocked 
across mainstream media, seeing 
as Georgetown’s entire endowment 
is worth approximately $1.5 billion 
dollars. The Tartan believes that this 
criticism is unwarranted, and found 
a number of very interesting ideas 
in the proposal. First and foremost, 
the reconciliation fund as it has been 
proposed isn’t limited to George-
town. As a national fund, it address-
es the issue of slavery reparations 
on the largest scale possible. Fur-
ther, it draws virtually every major 
American university into the issue 
and would successfully start a con-
versation capable of being backed by 
large-scale action; This is something 
that Georgetown’s current plan can-
not possibly hope to accomplish.
The next question, clearly, is 
where a university such as Carn-
egie Mellon, established after the 
abolition of slavery, belongs in this 
debate. Racism and oppression can 
take many forms, of which slavery 
is arguably the most horri?c. Due to 
its age, Carnegie Mellon has had far 
fewer brushes with overt racism than 
a school such as Georgetown. 
What we must beware of, howev-
er, is to not use that fact as an excuse 
to evade this entire debate. The same 
problems, though not as severe, do 
af?ict us as well. Even today, black 
people are an underrepresented 
community at Carnegie Mellon. 
There isn’t enough of a dialogue on 
race and its cultural meanings here. 
Our moral obligation to participate 
in this debate stems not from horri?c 
past transgressions, but from the 
little things that have collectively re-
sulted in a culture of apathy towards 
issues of race.

SARAH BENDER
My younger sister has a tree nut 
allergy. For her, that means that eat-
ing cashews or almonds or pistachios 
does horrible things to her body. She 
throws up. She breaks out in hives. 
She goes into anaphylactic shock.
No one has ever accused her of 
faking her allergy to get out of eat-
ing foods she doesn’t like. No one has 
ever told her not to eat in a restaurant 
if she has to avoid certain items on 
the menu. No one has tried to coerce 
her into gradually exposing herself 
to the allergens she reacts to — while 
such treatment does work in many 
cases, it’s obvious that only doctors 
are quali?ed to make that call. No 
one claims that warnings placed on 
food labels to protect her limit what 
other people can consume.
Yet if we apply this scenario to 
mental health rather than physi-
cal health, we ?nd ourselves in the 
middle of a vicious debate about 
trigger warnings. 
This discussion has become par-
ticularly prominent across college 
campuses recently as students and 
instructors struggle to foster an 
academic environment that is open 
as well as safe for all members of 
the community.
The University of Chicago started 
off the school year by informing 
new students that trigger warn-
ings and other notices of sensitive 
material would not be used on the 
campus. The school believes that 
sheltering students from 
discomfort can be harmful in the 
long run, and cited a commitment 
to free speech and a belief in the im-
portance of debate as their primary 
reasoning for this decision.
“Our commitment to academic 
freedom means that we do not sup-
port so-called ‘trigger warnings,’” 
Jay Ellison, the Dean of Students, 
stated in a letter to incoming fresh-
men. He continued, saying, “We do 
not cancel invited speakers because 
their topics might prove contro-
versial, and we do not condone the 
creation of intellectual ‘safe spaces’ 
where individuals can retreat from 
ideas and perspectives at odds with 
their own.”
In response, over 150 faculty 
members of the university published 
a letter of their own, also addressed 
to the students. This letter, though it 
did not mention trigger warnings di-
rectly, did make a point to state that 
requests for such notices 
are often closely linked 
to “ongoing issues of 
bias, intolerance, 
and trauma that 
affect our intellectual 
exchanges.”
“To start a con-
versation by declar-
ing that such requests 
are not worth making is 
an affront to the basic 
principles of liberal education and 
participatory democracy,” the fac-
ulty claimed. They encouraged stu-
dents to speak out about their rights 
in order to create a space where they 
are best able to learn.
This thinking seems to fall in line 
with that of many other colleges 
throughout the country, including 
the University of California, Santa 
Barbara and Oberlin College, that 
have actually asked professors to 
include trigger warnings in their syl-
labi in order to alert students to un-
comfortable material.
So are trigger warnings poten-
tially dangerous to free speech, or is 
the University of Chicago making a 
misinformed decision that is threat-
ening the mental health and comfort 
of their students? In reality, it may be 
a little of both.
It is unfortunate, but hard to deny 
that our culture’s use of the term 
“trigger warning” as a whole

A little less than two years ago 
an anonymous woman was sexually 
assaulted by Brock Turner, a former 
swimmer at Stanford University. 
This past June, a signi?cant amount 
of media coverage was given to the 
case when Judge Aaron Persky sen-
tenced Turner to serve a mere six 
months at Santa Clara County Jail, 
supported by the reasoning that a 
longer and harsher sentence would 
have a “severe impact” on Turner’s 
future given his age. On Sept. 2, 
2016, three months after the start of 
Turner’s sentence, he was released 
early, having served just half of his 
criminally lenient sentence.
Turner has since returned home 
to Dayton, Ohio where he has to reg-
ister as a sex offender for life, but he 
is a free man. Things seemed to have 
worked out better than Persky could 
have even hoped. A mere three 
months behind bars! That’s sure to 
mean an even less signi?cant impact 
on Turner’s future. How nice for the 
both of them.
The biggest ?aw with Judge 
Persky’s logic is that this case is not 
about what is best for the perpetra-
tor. This case is about punishing 
and serving justice to a man who 
has committed a crime that will for-
ever have asevere impact” on his vic-
tim. Turner’s best interests are not 
what should be at the forefront of 
his sentence.
The pain and suffering that Turn-
er’s anonymous victim faced that 
night and in the many months fol-
lowing will remain with her for the 
rest of her life. But our legal system 
has told her that her anguish is only 
worth three months of discomfort 
for her rapist.
This woman made a choice to 
press rape charges against Brock 
Turner; a choice that many women 
don’t make because of how drawn 
out and painful this process can be. 
She made a choice to seek out jus-
tice. She had to struggle through 
more than a year of investigation 
and retell her story countless times 
to countless of?cials. Something like 
that does not get easier with time or 
repetition. Each instance of repeti-
tion is a stark and painful reminder 
of what has passed.
She understood how painful and 
long the process of accusing Turner 
through the legal system would 
be but she chose to do so in hopes 
that some sort of justice would be 
served. The United States legal sys-
tem not only did her wrong, but also 
wronged the thousands of women 
who are victims of rape in the United 
States each year.
The letter that this incredibly 
strong woman wrote and read to 
her rapist in court made this case 
followed nationally. The conviction 
and sentencing of Brock Turner had 
the potential to serve as an example 
across the country of our nation’s 
intolerance to sexual abuse. Instead, 
it turned into a case highlighting 
corrupt judges and injustice in our 
legal system.
What cannot happen is for peo-
ple to lose faith in the legal system 
and stop following sexual assault 
cases to their conclusion. Our coun-
try needs to make it clear that there 
is zero tolerance for rape, something 
it has not done well up to this point.
Men and women who are the sur-
vivors of rape must not be pushed to 
the wayside by our legal system. It 
goes against everything our legal 
system claims to stand for. It takes a 
lot of strength and courage to press 
charges of sexual assault, and there 
is no reason why this is something 
that should be made into an even 
more dif?cult and painful process by 
the court.

Welcome back! Last time we took 
a whirlwind tour of U.S. election his-
tory as I opened my defense of the 
two-party system. This week, we will 
analyze the evolution of our media 
outlets over the past two decades 
and discuss how we all can individu-
ally work to bridge our country’s 
partisan divide.
As the son of someone who works 
in the news media, I was raised lis-
tening to NPR. I was not particularly 
dependent on any television network 
for my information. And just like you, 
I experienced the mass expansion of 
the internet as I grew up. Since 2007, 
the number of internet users world-
wide has tripled.
Carnegie Mellon students are too 
young to remember when there were 
only three channels on television: 
ABC, CBS, and NBC. They were sta-
ples in people’s everyday culture that 
provided news every evening. People 
did not listen to the news to reinforce 
their own opinions; they listened to 
the news to get the news.
Then came CNN. (For those of 
you who don’t watch TV, you prob-
ably have seen it in airports whether 
you like it or not.) The Cable News 
Network was founded in 1980 as a 
24-hour news service. News, all the 
time. More news shows were created 
to ?ll time with the same stories. One 
of my favorite CNN spectacles was its 
coverage of the lost Malaysian Air-
line Flight 370; it constantly covered 
every little detail about it for weeks 
on end. CNN took an event that was a 
tragic loss of life and sucked its emo-
tional value dry with overwhelming 
coverage; it ended up becoming in-
credibly boring.
Things began to change during 
the 1990s. FOX News and MSNBC 
were both created in 1996. Both po-
litically lean far more drastically to 
either side; FOX being conservative, 
and MSNBC being liberal. Now view-
ers could choose which type of news 
they wanted to watch. If a Federalist 
chose to read a Federalist-leaning 
newspaper in 1793, he would prob-
ably reaf?rm his own views. Due 
to the availability of television, the 
same principle applies here, except 
on a much larger scale.
Through the Bush and especially 
Obama years, as we will talk about in 
greater detail next column, partisan 
obstructionism led to more gridlock 
than actual governance. Many on ei-
ther side of the divide chose the me-
dia that they agreed with most. The 
news reporting may be accurate, but 
when people do not watch or lis-
ten to sources that they dis-
agree with, it reaf?rms 
that their own opinion 
is the right one. This 
problem worsened with 
the rise of the internet.
As we know from last 
week, the two parties act 
as large umbrellas, with 
more extreme minority 
voices on both sides. 
With the rise of the 
internet over the 
last decade, these 
minorities created their 
own sources of online 
news. The progressive 
liberal show The Young 
Turks started broadcasting 
on YouTube in 2005. Things 
got even more extreme 
with the founding of the 
Breitbart News Network 
in 2007. Breitbart has been 
described as “conser-
vative news” by other 
networks, but it often 
peddles conspiracy theories 
from the “alt-right” movement.
The omnipresence of the new me-
dia forces more traditional media like 
newspapers and cable TV news to ad-
just their strategies by pushing more 
?ashy headlines and less substan-
tive stories. This is one reason the 
GOP nominee in our current election 
got so much more momentum than 
people predicted. The TV networks 
could not help themselves every time 
the nominee said anything out of the 
ordinary, giving him over two billion 
dollars of free advertising instead 
of covering the candidates with, for 
example, actual plans. We will dive 
into this in far greater detail in our 
fourth installment.
When these large media outlets 
start to compromise the quality of 
their reporting, it allows others to 
create false stories that they can 
advertise as the truth. This comes 
from more partisan news sources, or 
even the politicians themselves. If a 
politician peddles the same narra-
tive over and over, he some-
times can convince a 
group of people that opinion is ac-
tually fact. This is a typical political 
strategy, sure, but when online me-
dia sources verify the claim or other 
news sources do not challenge the 
claim, (ahem, Matt Lauer) people 
can start to believe these “facts,” 
and in some cases there can be 
dangerous consequences.
People no longer have to settle 
for one of the three nightly news 
shows of generations past. They can 
get their news whenever they want, 
with whichever spin they want. 
Those on the far right delight in Bre-
itbart headlines, while Bernie Bros 
stay dedicated to The Young Turks. 
Both think they are completely in the 
right, and neither is willing to even 
try to talk about it.
This encourages an increase in 
the partisanship we have known for 
the past decade. Now I’m not saying 
that everyone in those organizations 
is a charlatan. In fact, sometimes 
people in the media on the other side 
of the political spectrum make points 
that I do not consider when forming 
my own arguments. 
And this 
brings me 
to my 
solution to our extreme partisanship 
in the era of modern media sources.
Listen.
Be challenged.
Seek out someone with whom 
you disagree, and ask them why they 
believe what they believe. There is 
often an argument that is more rea-
sonable than you might expect.
When you open up a new tab for 
news, choose two differing outlets to 
gather several perspectives. Conser-
vatives: Give MSNBC a chance now 
and again. And liberals: Even though 
you disagree with the Wall Street 
Journal editorial page, that does not 
mean it is always wrong. One of the 
beautiful things about our country 
is that so many people can have so 
many different opinions, and gener-
ally speaking, we can all hold these 
opinions openly. If we all read from 
news sources we don’t agree with, 
maybe we would be more willing to 
understand where our political op-
ponents get their motivations. Per-
haps we would be more willing to 
work with them and compromise to 
?nd solutions to our problems.
In a world where our presiden-
tial debates are being advertised as 
something along the lines of “Smack-
down 2016: America Edition,” facts 
do not tend to matter. That simply 
would not be good for ratings. 
Facts can once again be valued 
if we as a nation can under-
stand that maybe our opin-
ions might not be totally right 
all the time after all. If we work 
to stem this tide in our own lives, we 
may ?nd a return to the 
sanity of a pragmat-
ic democracy again 
in our government.
Join me next 
time as we dive back 
into modern U.S. 
history and analyze 
how our two current par-
ties have ended up so ideologically 
far apart, and how events 50 years 
ago put us on the track to the elec-
tion campaign we have on our hands 
today.

Suicide is the second-leading 
cause of death among American 
people aged 25 to 34. Statistics show 
that about 1,100 American college 
students commit suicide every year, 
and one in ten American college 
students have made a plan for sui-
cide. And the problem is only getting 
worse: the suicide rate among young 
adults aged 15 to 24 has tripled since 
the 1950s.
On March 29, 2016, two bright 
Carnegie Mellon students committed 
suicide, leaving those around them 
in astonishment and grief.
On a more personal note, one 
alumni from my high school and 
close friend of my many peers com-
mitted suicide in Feb. of this year.
Under this serious and crucial 
background, Carnegie Mellon en-
hanced its attention on mental health 
care by emphasizing its Counseling 
and Psychological Services (CaPS) 
program, bringing in mental health 
?rst-aid training days and activities 
such as Send Silence Packing, an ex-
hibit of 1,100 backpacks that repre-
sent the college students who are lost 
to suicide every year, incorporating 
“Student Wellness” in most if not all 
class syllabi, establishing places like 
the Mindfulness Room. 
But what’s the effect? Few stu-
dents make appointments with 
CaPS for fear of being regarded as 
“mentally ill,” which is still a stereo-
type regardless of how 
many times the university tells stu-
dents that asking for help is a sign of 
strength. Every mental health ?rst-
aid training this semester is held on 
a weekday and takes eight hours, 
making it impossible for most stu-
dents to attend, and these trainings 
target only mental illness and sub-
stance abuse, leaving a huge gap in 
coverage for mental problems that 
most people don’t regard as illnesses. 
Students seldom read the “Student 
Wellness” section of class syllabi be-
cause it just seems irrelevant, and 
few professors spend time reading 
that section, as opposed to hours 
spent on explaining grading criteria 
over and over again. Most of the time 
few students are in the Mindfulness 
Room, and those who do either lie on 
the cushion and fall asleep or bring 
their work with them into the room, 
completely missing the initiative of 
“recover and inspire yourself,” as 
stated on its website.
It may also be surprising that 
many students who committed sui-
cide actually didn’t have symptoms 
of typical mental illness. Many are 
shocked when they hear that their 
extroverted, friendly acquaintances 
commit suicide, replying with, “I 
never thought this would happen to 
them” or “But they were so optimis-
tic!” or “They were so good in every-
thing! How was that even possible?” 
Why would these seemingly hope-of- 
tomorrow students make these deci-
sions that affects not only 
themselves, but also 
those around them?
The answer, for me, 
is peer pressure. At 
Carnegie Mellon, as 
opposed to many other 
institutions, most of 
the students work re-
ally hard, and are 
afraid of being surpassed by their 
peers in dimensions like grades, 
workload, course dif?culty, research, 
internship, job, salary, and more. For 
many, their “heart is in the work,” but 
few relate this motto to its context.
This world-famous motto by An-
drew Carnegie was announced in his 
letter announcing his determined-
ness to contribute all his efforts to 
build this university. Contrary to our 
situation now, no one was there to 
rival him. His heart was in the work 
not to surpass or keep up with others, 
but because he really enjoyed what 
he was doing and what he would 
achieve by doing it.
For most of us, however, it’s all 
about competition. When we hear 
that someone around us is attending 
the career fair this week, we natural-
ly rush there so that we won’t feel left 
out or beaten, even if the fair is to-
tally meaningless and boring for us. 
We choose the hardest courses and 
vow to get the highest GPA in class. 
When we see others come up with an 
interesting project, we stay up late to 
think of a better one.
I’m certainly not discouraging this 
spirit: it’s what motivates us to prog-
ress. However, too much of it distorts 
our primary cause of doing what we 
like. Without passion about the work 
itself, the work may turn out to be a 
tiring chore that we’re forced to ?n-
ish so that others won’t look down 
upon us. A friend of mine who is 
very interested in computer science 
complained to me the other day that, 
“Everybody else is just too bright. 
Most of them come with a deep com-
puter science background, and many 
have already built apps themselves. 
I feel so intimidated by their intelli-
gence,” then, “I’m now beginning to 
reconsider my choice of major. Is this 
really suitable for me?” A ?rst-year 
math major told me that 
she had to 
stay up till 2 a.m. just to be the ?rst 
one to submit a homework that’s due 
next week.
When I told my friends in other 
universities about this, they often 
found it dif?cult to imagine and un-
derstand, and I replied, “Well, that’s 
our campus culture. That’s why we 
earn the most salary after we gradu-
ate.” But now that I come to think 
more deeply about it, this may not 
be the best thing possible. Although 
colleges were primarily established 
to hold class meetings, college life 
has long since transformed. Building 
social relationships, discovering and 
discussing our personal values and 
passions, learning to think logically 
as well as creatively — all of these 
are essential for a meaningful college 
life. Prioritizing work can be good, 
but our lives certainly shouldn’t re-
volve around work.
Accompanying intense competi-
tion is the phenomenon of students 
avoiding admitting to having a prob-
lem. This includes students continu-
ing to work when not feeling well, 
keeping questions to themselves to 
be solved later, not asking for help 
when anxious, and constantly wor-
rying that their “mask” of perfection 
will be unveiled. This in turn leads to 
even more serious problems, and as 
problems internalize, they root deep-
er, ?nally becoming non-erasable 
and unchangeable.
How can the university help with 
this? Mental illness treatments such 
as the First-aid programs miss the 
huge scale of students who aren’t 
necessarily ill, but still possess psy-
chological discomfort, and tempo-
rary relaxation, like the Mindfulness 
Room, Project Smile, which sets up 
days to show kindness, Paws to Relax, 
a program that invites animals such 
as dogs to interact with students, 
or Picnic on the Cut, which gives stu-
dents free rental of picnic mats, don’t 
solve the core of the problem, or, in 
a Chinese saying, “solves the symp-
toms but not the disease.”
The root of the problem, peer 
pressure, lies in campus culture it-
self, so it’s hard to change. However, 
this doesn’t mean that there’s noth-
ing to do. Administrators can help by 
offering to chat with students about 
their lives rather than immediately 
referring them to consultations or 
treatment with CaPS. Professors can 
help by encouraging teamwork in 
courses and activities by assigning 
team projects, encouraging presen-
tations and discussions about stu-
dents themselves through exercises 
and assignments, and encouraging 
students to explore their own ?elds 
of strength by providing various op-
portunities of research and activities. 
Students can help by kindly offering 
non-condescending help, asking our 
friends if they feel okay when we 
sense that they are down, and open-
ing up discussions about them rather 
than us.
These steps may seem trivial, and 
are de?nitely not big changes such as 
the establishment of the Mindfulness 
Room, but remember, Rome wasn’t 
built in one day. True, this approach 
takes many more years to lay the 
foundation, but this slow shaping of 
campus culture is what will actually 
work to reduce student stress in the 
long term.
Having said this, I still appreciate 
the university’s effort at trying hard 
to mitigate the problem. All of us: 
administrators, professors, and stu-
dents must work together to promote 
mental health for this institution as 
a whole. We can’t just sit there and 
hope for the best, or rely on 
only ourselves to make 
changes. We must stand 
up and create a better 
future together.

“Send Silence Packing” unpacks mental illness stigma
EMILY GALLAGHER
Last Thursday morning, as I was 
walking up the steps of the College 
of Fine Arts, there was a row of back-
packs lining the walkway in front 
of the building. Each of these back-
packs had a piece of paper attached 
to the top of it, and these papers 
had pictures of college students and 
stories about their lives. There were 
backpacks of all different colors and 
brands, with logos from many uni-
versities across the United States, but 
the common factor between all these 
bags is that each one of them repre-
sented the life of a college student 
who had committed suicide.
I looked down the row of 
backpacks, unsure if I wanted to cry 
or throw up as I began to realize what 
they were. I then looked across the 
lawn and saw huge blue bags being 
unloaded from a truck and a team 
of students pulling backpacks out 
of these bags and placing them on 
the grass. There were hundreds and 
hundreds of backpacks, the stories of 
hundreds and hundreds of lives cut 
short being laid on the lawn in hopes 
of preventing another life, another 
backpack from joining those facing 
skywards on the grass.
This display was a touring exhibi-
tion known as “Send Silence Pack-
ing.” The exhibition is made up of 
1,100 donated backpacks and has 
been displayed in over 100 cities in 
the United States since the project’s 
inception in 2008. Each year approxi-
mately 1,100 college students die as 
a result of suicide, and the backpacks 
represent the lives of these students. 
The backpacks are displayed on 
college campuses to raise awareness 
about mental health and “the inci-
dence and impact of suicide.”
The program was brought to 
Carnegie Mellon by Active Minds, the 
campus chapter of the national orga-
nization which strives to diminish the 
stigma surrounding mental illness 
and health and spread awareness of 
these issues.
I am so grateful that this program 
was brought to our campus. Mental 
health is a taboo on this campus no 
matter how much people would like 
to deny it. Many students who need 
help don’t seek it out for a plethora 
of reasons, but one of the biggest is 
that they are afraid of admitting they 
need help in the ?rst place. The fact 
that there is a stigma around men-
tal illness is not the fault of any one 
person, organization, or corporation, 
but is a dangerous ideology that has 
become a part of our society, and 
one that is particularly prominent on 
college campuses.
Carnegie Mellon is a place where 
students will push themselves to their 
own personal limits and beyond to 
achieve success. Sleepless nights and 
course overloads with no lunch break 
are not uncommon. In fact, there is 
almost an unspoken expectation that 
you will be doing these things some-
where along the way. Although these 
circumstances are not necessarily 
the cause of mental illness, they cer-
tainly do not help the situation. It 
is easy to feel inadequate when you 
look around at all the amazing things 
your peers are doing. When students 
begin to feel inferior, overwhelmed, 
and under appreciated, matters are 
only made worse by the fact that 
stigmas surrounding mental health 
result in feelings of helplessness and 
loneliness. Suicide has become the 
number two cause of death of col-
lege students nationwide. The idea 
of putting one’s head in the sand 
and hoping a problem goes away has 
never been one that has worked, and 
taking this approach to mental illness 
puts human life in danger.
It is clear that students on this 
campus are trying to start a conver-
sation about mental health. What is 
vital at this point is to join in that con-
versation. It is an issue that should be 
important to every single students 
because mental health is something 
every person struggles with in their 
own way.
“Send Silence Packing” is a heart-
breaking exhibition with the intent 
of breaking down the walls that we 
have created surrounding the topic of 
mental health. Each life represented 
by a backpack on the lawn is a cry to 
remember the lives that have been 
lost and a reminder to take care of 
yourself and those around you.

Trigger warnings enable open conversation, free speech
 TRIGGER WARNINGS, from A7
has spiraled out of control recently. 
In an opinion piece for The Guard-
ian, Jill Filipovic identi?es a danger 
in what she calls a “general trigger 
warning” — that, in listing every top-
ic in a book or ?lm that students may 
?nd uncomfortable, professors risk 
coloring reactions to the material as 
well as highlighting certain aspects 
as more impactful, just because they 
could be traumatic. 
Even worse is when professors 
simply remove mention of the trig-
gering material. Instead of merely 
warning students so that they can 
prepare themselves, this reaction 
leans more toward protective cen-
sorship, which brings the ?ow and 
development of ideas to a halt.Some 
particularly devious students may 
even view the confusion surrounding 
the application of trigger warnings as 
a convenient way to get excused from 
an assignment without a negative ef-
fect on their grade.
But stopping the misuse of the 
term “trigger warning” and holding 
students accountable for their work 
is drastically different from failing 
to acknowledge the bene?ts that ad-
vanced notice of dif?cult topics may 
have for students who have recently 
suffered trauma. Because that is 
what trigger warnings were initially 
intended to do: to alert students that 
they will be faced with dif?cult mate-
rial, so that they can mentally prepare 
themselves and arrive in control of 
the situation and ready to contribute. 
They don’t help you avoid something 
you don’t like. They don’t censor the 
speech of others. They protect people 
from discomfort, panic attacks, and 
worse reactions that come from be-
ing unprepared to face something 
that threatens their mental health.
That’s not to say that the Univer-
sity of Chicago doesn’t care about 
their students’ mental health. In all 
likelihood, the school’s understand-
ing of the purpose of trigger warn-
ings has been colored by the many 
in?ated or just plain wrong applica-
tions that seem to pervade public 
discussion of late. 
But with a narrower de?nition in 
mind, there are people with genuine 
needs that must be respected, and 
the University of Chicago has done 
them a disservice by shutting down 
discussions about accommodations.
The simple truth is that trigger 
warnings are ultimately empower-
ing to people who, for one reason 
or another, might suffer if taken off 
guard by a topic. The advance warn-
ing can help to prevent panic attacks, 
and can also allow students to speak 
to therapists or friends about the best 
way to handle the lesson. Instructors 
can even offer alternative readings 
or viewings for course material that 
involves a lot of sexual violence or 
other graphic material.
There are those who claim that 
people who might need trigger warn-
ings don’t belong in college. “Real 
life doesn’t have trigger warnings,” 
some may say, “Students shouldn’t 
get away with being coddled,” but in 
real life, it’s actually relatively easy to 
avoid subjects that make you uneasy. 
If you’re terri?ed of jump scares, 
your friends probably won’t invite 
you on a trip to a haunted house. If 
the sight of blood makes you queasy, 
you can take comfort in the fact that 
movies and video games must have 
warnings that alert consumers to 
violent content.
College, on the other hand, is for 
many students a chance to push at 
boundaries, to take on dif?cult sub-
jects and learn more about the world 
than you would be exposed to in your 
everyday life. With the proper appli-
cation of trigger warnings, it should 
make conversations accessible for 
everyone who might have valuable 
insight. If trigger warnings are used 
to warn, not to censor, then all stu-
dents will feel in control of course 
material, and campuses can remain 
both open to discussions and safe 
for their students.

Tartan football earns ?rst win at home over Waynesburg
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
On Saturday, the Carnegie 
Mellon football team faced 
off against the Waynesburg 
Yellow Jackets. The Tartans 
won the game 35–23, improv-
ing to 1–1 overall and 1–0 
in the Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference (PAC).
The Tartan offense did not 
have a great ?rst drive, having 
to punt after getting one ?rst 
down. Waynesburg immedi-
ately gave the ball back as ju-
nior outside linebacker Quen-
tin Wolfe recovered a fumble, 
and junior quarterback Bryan 
Jangro was able to get a touch-
down two plays later, putting 
the Tartans up by seven points. 
On the next drive, the Tartan 
defense forced the Yellow 
Jackets to punt, but ?rst-year 
running back William Richter 
returned the ball for 30 yards 
into Waynesburg territory. 
Waynesburg’s defense, how-
ever, was able to stuff junior 
running back Sam Benger, 
and Jangro was unable to get a 
completion on third down. 
The Tartans decided to go 
for it, but Jangro was unable 
to escape the pocket, giving 
the football right back to the 
Yellow Jackets. Wolfe was able 
to bail the offense out as he 
sacked Waynesburg’s quarter-
back on third down, forcing 
them to punt.
Richter made another great 
return into Waynesburg terri-
tory, and though the Tartans 
were unable to convert on 
third down, sophomore run-
ning back Rory Hubbard ran 
on fourth down all the way to 
the goal line. On the next play, 
Jangro underthrew the foot-
ball, resulting in an intercep-
tion, but the Tartan defense 
was once again able to force 
Waynesburg to punt. Benger 
was able to get some success 
against the Yellow Jacket de-
fense on the next drive, es-
pecially on a draw play that 
ended the ?rst quarter.
The Tartans were unable to 
progress at the start of the sec-
ond quarter, punting it away. 
After the defense retrieved the 
ball for the Tartans, the Tar-
tan offense once again ?zzled. 
Instead of punting it away, se-
nior running back Mike Min-
jock received a direct snap, 
making a ?rst down for the 
Tartans. Jangro still seemed to 
have some troubles with accu-
racy, but junior wide receiver 
John Prather was able to make 
a key ?rst down after making 
a dif?cult catch. The Tartans 
had a chance for a touchdown, 
but Jangro overthrew his man. 
The Tartans later tried a ?eld 
goal, but the ball sailed left. 
Waynesburg then marched 
down the ?eld, making it into 
the endzone and tying the 
game up 7–7. The Tartan of-
fense wasn’t able to do any-
thing on their next drive, and 
Waynesburg managed the 
remaining time on the clock 
to their advantage: getting all 
the way to the Tartan goal line 
for a ?eld goal attempt that 
sailed wide left, keeping the 
game tied up the end of the 
?rst half.
The Yellow Jackets took to 
the offense again in the sec-
ond half, but the Tartan de-
fense was able to stop them. 
The ball changed sides several 
times more as each offense 
tried to break the stalemate. 
Disaster looked like it had 
stricken when Jangro took a 
heavy sack, but sophomore 
quarterback Alex Cline was 
able to get a third down con-
version before Benger was 
?nally able to break free and 
score a touchdown, putting 
the Tartans up 14–7.
The Yellow Jackets got the 
ball back with good ?eld po-
sition after a kickoff return 
brought them to the 42-yard 
line, but they once again went 
nowhere. The Tartan offense 
was pinned deep and didn’t 
dare to try anything risky. 
After getting the ball back in 
Tartan territory, the Yellow 
Jackets looked like they would 
once again ?zzle before mak-
ing a huge third and long con-
version. Waynesburg made it 
down to the goal line, but the 
Tartan defense forced them to 
settle for a ?eld goal, their lead 
slimming to 14–10. On the 
next drive, Cline tried to get 
the ball out, but he fumbled 
as he was taken down, and 
Waynesburg got the football 
back at the end of the quarter.
The Yellow Jackets wasted 
no time getting the ball into 
the end zone as the fourth 
quarter began, getting a 
completion that put them 
up 17–14. After a 27-yard 
kickoff return by Richter, 
Prather hauled in a pass and 
went for over 50 yards into 
Waynesburg’s red zone. The 
Tartans kept pushing forward, 
and on third and goal, Cline 
threw the ball to the left end 
of the end zone where Prather 
was able to haul it in to put the 
Tartans up 21–17.
The Tartan defense once 
again stopped the Waynesburg 
offense, and Richter brought 
the ball back to the Yellow 
Jackets’ side of the ?eld. The 
Tartans looked like they had 
gotten a long completion, but 
it was ruled out of bounds, 
resulting in another punt 
that pinned the Yellow Jack-
ets within their 10-yard line. 
Waynesburg was once again 
unable to get anything done on 
offense, and the Tartans went 
to work at killing the clock. 
Benger and Hubbard got the 
Tartans to the goal line be-
fore junior wide receiver Alex 
Froimzon made a one handed 
catch for a touchdown, put-
ting the Tartans up 28–17.
Waynesburg wasn’t done 
?ghting, taking the next kick-
off past the 50-yard line. They 
quickly advanced further, and 
got a touchdown pass to cut 
the Tartans’ lead to 28–23. The 
Yellow Jackets tried and failed 
a two-point conversion, even 
after a holding call against the 
Tartans gave them a second 
chance at the attempt. Though 
the game plan for the next 
drive was milking more time 
off the clock, Benger found 
tons of open room and made 
a 64-yard run, and Hubbard 
took it in to the end zone a few 
plays later, giving the Tartans 
an insurmountable 35–23 
lead going into the latter part 
of the competition.
Waynesburg’s return man 
had a chance for a kickoff 
return touchdown, but ju-
nior punter and kicker Tyler 
Kohman took him down, even 
though he had to commit to 
a horse collar tackle to do so. 
Kohman’s tackle eliminated 
any last hopes the Yellow 
Jackets had as time ran out.
This game was a tough ?ght 
from start to ?nish. For much 
of the game, Waynesburg was 
able to hold Benger in check, 
forcing Jangro to try and make 
something happen himself. 
Jangro took a particularly 
heavy hit that forced him to 
leave the game, though hope-
fully he will recover soon.
Despite the tough ?ght 
Waynesburg put up, the Tar-
tans held a clear edge on spe-
cial teams as Kohman forced 
the visitors to ?ght harder 
for yardage and Richter gave 
the Tartan offense good ?eld 
position. Cline was able to 
energize the offense, and the 
efforts of his passing game al-
lowed Benger and Hubbard 
to break loose in the end. The 
Tartans will be up for some 
tough battles in the games to 
come, but they proved today 
that they have the fortitude to 
keep pressing forward.
The Tartans will next play 
at Thomas More College on 
Saturday, Sept. 24.
Women’s soccer dominates Washington and Jefferson 
Volleyball earns No. 14 spot after three wins on the road
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team took the 
?eld at home on Wednesday 
to face off against Washington 
and Jefferson College. The 
Tartans dominated the Presi-
dents 4–0, which improves 
the Tartans’ record to 3–2 on 
the season.
The game began slowly, 
but the Tartans started to ap-
ply pressure by playing on the 
opposing side of the ?eld and 
getting some early shots on 
goal. Junior mid?elder Tori 
Iatarola had two shots on goal 
early in the game, both end-
ing wide of the goal. 
The Presidents also had a 
shot on goal in the 13th min-
ute, but it bounced off the 
post and the Tartans main-
tained subtle control of the 
game. The ?rst score came 
in the 22nd minute, when 
junior defender Alex Moy 
connected with ?rst-year 
forward Sydney Webber in 
the mid?eld. Webber then 
found sophomore forward 
Kaily Bruch on the sideline, 
and Bruch skirted around a 
defender before making a 
break for the goal. She sent 
a low kick to the far goal post 
and the shot went in, and giv-
ing the Tartans their ?rst real 
momentum of the game with 
a one-point lead.
The Tartans did not let 
up in the second half, and in 
the 47th minute they earned 
a free kick. From about 50 
yards away from the goal, ju-
nior defender Katie Strycharz 
sent the ball toward the goal 
where a defender knocked the 
ball away with a header. Moy 
responded quickly and gath-
ered the free ball, then sent a 
kick to the far side of the net 
to earn her ?rst goal of the 
season and to put the Tartans 
up 2–0.
The Tartans went right 
back to scoring, when two 
minutes later ?rst-year 
forward Ryan Casey scored 
her third goal of the season 
by rebounding a blocked shot 
taken by Iatarola. The Tartans 
had a 3–0 lead at this point 
and looked very comfortable 
closing the game out.
Iatarola scored the ?nal 
goal of the game for the Tar-
tans in the 80th minute, when 
she returned a blocked shot 
from sophomore forward 
Katja Bracklemanns-Puig. Iat-
arola ?oated a shot right over 
the goalkeeper’s head and se-
cured the fourth goal of the 
game for the Tartans.
Tartan goalkeeper sopho-
more Sarah Mahler preserved 
the shutout in the 89th min-
ute with a diving save, and 
left no question as to who was 
the better team that day.
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team returns 
to play on Tuesday, Sept. 20 
when they travel to Baldwin 
Wallace University and try 
to improve their record. The 
game is set to start at 7 p.m.

Sarah Gutekunst | Publisheradvice for awkward people
on having to feed yourself after leaving the nest
Dear Sarah,
Now that I’m a sophomore and I’m living off-campus, no 
more RA, no more beep boop on the way to class, and no 
more meal plan. And that last one is the real problem. I’m 
inept, lazy, and poor. All of the odds are against me.
My mom makes it look so easy, cooking dinner every single 
day. Because she obviously never involved me in that 
process, I don’t really know how to plan and cook a meal. 
But I am an expert at spooning a can of SpaghettiOs into a 
bowl and turning on the microwave.
You’re probably thinking, you can’t live on SpaghettiOs, 
that’s terrible for your health. Well, you’re right. But I’m more 
concerned about my time and money. That’s what I miss 
the most about my meal plan: the immediate gratification 
of prepared food, without swiping my debit card or forking 
out cash.
I could buy a can of off-brand SpaghettiOs at Aldi for $0.65! 
Then in two minutes, I have a warm bowl of food that’s 
going to fill me up, and I didn’t have to chop, dice, season, 
sauté, roast, or plate. Ain’t nobody got time for that! I could 
save myself so many verbs by just putting crap in the 
microwave.
But alas, my parents are worried about my nutrition. They 
give me grocery money and tell me to buy vegetables, 
protein, and whole grains, so I just have all of these 
ingredients in my kitchen. When I’m hungry, standing 
in front of my fridge, all I can see are the minutes upon 
minutes of labor it would take to turn it all into something I 
want to eat when I could just be lying down watching Parks 
and Rec. I want the convenience of takeout, but I don’t 
want to pay for it.
I’m at a loss. How do I reconcile all of my needs?
Grumbling stomach sound,
Sadly Eating No Dinner Seriously Need A Cheap KFC

Dear SENDSNACKS,
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve yearned for the 
days when I could just put on some pants, walk to The 
Underground, and be back in bed 10 minutes later with 
chicken fingers and french fries.
It’s complicated. Part of “adulting” is getting over yourself 
and doing things that suck. Yes, it sucks like heck to stand 
up for more than two minutes — I’m very sensitive to that. 
But there are ways to spread it out and make it easier.
If you can dedicate a couple of hours each weekend to 
going balls to the wall and preparing meals in advance, 
this will make those weeknights where you just want to 
inhale your weight in food from the comfort of your bed 
that much easier. Store the leftovers in containers in the 
fridge or freezer (depending how long you need them to 
last), so that when dinner time rolls around all you need 
to do is pop one in the microwave! Maximum satisfaction, 
minimum effort, zero money out of your pocket.
The best meals to do this with are “casseroles” like baked 
ziti or enchiladas, a good hearty soup (think taco soup), or 
just pieces of meat, like baked chicken breasts or pulled 
pork in the crockpot. Even having your meat prepared will 
make the rest of the meal prep so much easier. If you have 
a chicken breast, all you need is noodles, sauce, cheese, 
water, and you have chicken parm! This will feel easier to 
tackle when all you can think about is the homework you 
have to do and sleep you need to catch up on.
Believe in yourself. If you make the task of cooking more 
manageable, you will be more successful!
Happy cooking,
Sarah
Apeksha Atal | Assistant Pillbox Editorwarm clothes: fall approaching
Get your wardrobe ready for the upcoming fall months 
The routine is almost set. 7 a.m. my alarm blares 
harmoniously through my room to wake me up and 
by 7:30, I’m in the kitchen putting an acceptable meal 
together. By 8:00, I’ve got my headphones in and I’m 
strolling down to class, and by 9:30, class is over.
The sun never fails to throw a regal glow over my 
furniture just before 7:00, devoid of the excessive 
warmth of the afternoon, and so I had to consider a 
means of shifting between the sleeves: short and long, 
and the pant lengths: short and long.
The routine settled in quite well at first. The morning air 
at the beginning of the school year is crisp and cooler 
than the rest of the day. I could comfortably wear my 
gym shorts and old shirt under a hoodie and ditch 
the hoodie on the way back home. Then came the 
complications.
Sometimes the sneakers made my feet feel sweaty, 
and sometimes it would rain while I was out in flip 
flops. Sometimes my socks would slip under my ankles 
if I wore sneakers, and pinch hard around my ankles 
in boots. There were times when I wanted warm tea, 
but by the time it was ready, the heat of noon had 
already made its way through my system. At times I 
would leave my sunglasses and the bottom of my bag 
and debate between squinting on the way home, or 
digging through my belongings.
The complications crept into my mind, and towered 
over me while I stared, aimlessly into my closet. The 
little voice that usually lulls me into a trance while I 
walk down a dark street at night whispered curses 
under its breath. There before me hung sweater after 
sweater, color-coded and cold, pushed to the side to 
leave room for the flirty sundress, the floral blouse, and 
the casual scarf.
Swimming through my head were the usual images. 
The crunchy crimson leaves, the rich orange of 
pumpkins and the sweet cinnamon bouquet of apple 
cider. I craved the warmth in the cold and the cold in 
the sun. I could see myself sorting through sweaters, 
picking which one to wear when, and where, and with 
who. The thick black and white stripes for the night 
out to an event and the blushing pink to brighten up a 
gloomy day. I would wear the deep navy when it was 
raining and pair it with the black tights and the boots. 
Oh, the boots.
The thick rubbery blues for the rain, and the black faux 
leather ankles for the weekend. The UGG knock-offs 
for impulsive target runs and the fur-lined knee-highs 
for those particularly chilly nights. And of course, you 
would pairs those with the hats. The beanies that you 
pull down over your ears as the air nips at your face, 
and their flaps that you tie around your chin when it 
gets too windy. The soft ones for when the day looks 
like it’s going to be rough, and the sharp ones for when 
you need to class it up. These of course match, those 
gloves. The gloves with the touchscreen compatible 
tips and the hooks that keep them together so that you 
don’t lose them in the sleeves of your jackets. The deep 
maroon one with the double breasted buttons and the 
collar that surpasses your neck. The black one that goes 
with everything, even though it’s missing a button, and 
the scraggly one that you probably should throw away 
but never will.
But alas, I heave a heavy sigh, for today, the sun is still 
shining with all its might and my sweaters must remain 
where they are.

Tales from Abroad: China
Adventures, learning experiences and embracing the uncomfortable.
So I missed the first week of classes to go on a fam-
ily trip to China. When I tell people this, the most 
common response I get is “why?” Why did I, the 
history nerd, want to visit one of the oldest and 
most culturally rich countries on the planet? Why 
did I, the college senior in respectable academic 
standing, opt for a once-in-a-lifetime experience (or 
if I’m lucky, twice) over yet another syllabus week? 
Or is the question why did I go? Me: the white girl, 
all-American and embarrassingly unilingual, with a 
“chinaboo” kid sister and parents who won a big 
case this year. Everyone calls travel “eye-opening” 
and “life-changing,” and I don’t expect to escape 
all the clichés. But travel is also an exercise in privi-
lege.
While abroad, I try to blend. I imagine the worst 
“American Tourist” stereotype and will myself to 
embody the opposite. Be polite and respectful. No 
dumb questions. Pay attention to the tour guide. 
Never assume that you know better. Heed all “no 
pictures” signs, especially in places of religious sig-
nificance. No complaints about people not speak-
ing your language; the average schoolchild here 
knows more English than you know of Mandarin, 
you poop. No demands that anything — the food, 
the weather, even the plane rides — conform to 
your expectations. Always be flexible. And most 
of all, never forget: this is not your exotic vacation 
locale, this is not your cultural zoo. 
This is you visiting an unfamiliar world filled with 
people more similar to you than not, learning and 
exploring and most importantly leaving it again 
untouched. Despite my rules, I did not blend in 
even a little. The curly red hair and pale-as-paper 
skin earned me open stares almost everywhere 
my family went. On a visit to the Forbidden City in 
Beijing, I was grabbed — quite literally grabbed — 
for a selfie by at least six locals. I felt like something 
of a minor celebrity; it was flattering and bizarre and 
anxiety inducing all at once. For the first time, my 
whiteness granted me “minority” status. But unlike 
other minorities, my whiteness didn’t put me at 
risk for harassment or discrimination or oppression; 
the only bullet I had to dodge was a camera flash. 
Tours of Buddhist temples and monasteries left me 
similarly uncomfortable. I was torn between awe 
at these places’ beauty and millennia of symbolic 
meaning, and fear that my very presence was an 
intrusion on these people’s deeply held religious 
beliefs. 
I nearly panicked in front of a 2,000-year-old 
golden Buddha in a Lhasa temple. Burning yak 
butter and heady incense permeated my nostrils 
and made my head swim. Dozens of local people 
jostled me from every side, single-minded in 
their determination to pray at one of the holi-
est sites in the world. I was a foreign obstacle to 
their blinding faith, and I wanted out. I needed 
to breathe. Also, for all that Beijing, Shanghai, 
and Xian are industrialized, modern cities, I never 
4

---------------------------------------------------

forgot that I was visiting a distinctly non-demo-
cratic country. Chairman Mao gazed serenely out 
at Tiananmen Square, manned every twenty or so 
yards by an armed officer. “Big Brother’s” webcam 
sat innocently on the dashboard of our Lhasa van, 
ready to report any incendiary things our guide 
might say. 
Funnily enough, I was able to open the “OkCupid” 
app — but the nearest users it picked up were in 
Bangladesh. And of course, every tour guide smil-
ingly referred to my father as a “businessman,” 
unaware that his daughter — raging liberal and 
aspiring revolutionary — was sitting quietly in the 
backseat.
There were simpler, less fraught moments of angst. 
I spent an hour tracking down my missing suitcase 
in Xian. I sat down for five minutes in Beijing and 
got eaten alive by mosquitoes. I had more than one 
less-than-flawless encounter with a squat toilet. 
And don’t even get me started on Tibet. Lhasa was 
three days of pounding headaches, total lack of 
appetite, and the vague feeling that I was floating. 
Altitude sickness is so real. Incidentally, Lhasa was 
also the midway point of the trip, right around when 
all my friends were posting “just got back! let’s 
get dinner!” messages in the group chat I couldn’t 
reply to. Holed up in our hotel’s “oxygen lounge” 
and trapped behind the “Great Firewall” of China, 
I read through these messages and wished I was 
back in the ‘Burgh with them. The grass is always 
greener, I suppose.
There were also simple moments of joy. To anyone 
looking for a pick-me-up, I wholeheartedly recom-
mend the panda breeding center in Chengdu, or 
these awesome fried soup dumplings in Shanghai, 
or the aerial view of mountainous Lhasa after a 
lung-beating climb.  I am bowled over by gratitude 
that I was privileged enough to do all this. So, I’d 
like to raise one of those obscenely large bottles of 
beer my parents received in every restaurant. Three 
cheers to adventure, to learning experiences, and 
to embracing the uncomfortable.

I Made It!
A night market at Squirrel Hill full of indie delights
You made it! No, literally, you made it. On Murray Avenue and Forbes Street Sept. 17, 
the I Made It! Market had its last Squirrel Hill Night Market for the summer. The Night 
Market was previously held June 18 and Aug. 20, and is an initiative of NextGenPgh, 
Uncover Squirrel Hill, and the Squirrel Hill Urban Coalition, according to the official web-
site of I Made It! Market. This month, the Night Market was centered around the Asian 
culture and community of Pittsburgh. Bubble tea was rampant as per usual, but so was 
origami and other paper crafts. The 3D Origami Art Studio sold various origami sculp-
tures and even kits so others could create and fold their own masterpieces. The shop 
specializes in kusudamas, Japanese flower balls and popular wedding decorations. While 
not having distinct Asian roots, Resident is another shop that sells kits that one can fold 
into their own geometric and deeply layered works of art, most often animal heads. The 
Market also featured creative Asian-founded businesses. Local pastry shop Yummyholic 
is founded by Jasmine Cho and sells custom treats ranging from cookies in the shape of 
Oprah’s face to matcha velvet cupcakes. The shop is also branching out into apparel that 
promises to be “Phan Pho-King Tastic” and fully embrace their Asian roots.Here are more 
highlights from the Squirrel Hill Night Market:
Go Carr Go: An art store specializing in the German paper cut art “scher-
enschnitte” with designs ranging from nerdy, a la Doctor Who and Alice in 
Wonderland, to classic red roses, or a silhouette of Pittsburgh’s Allegheny, 
Monongahela, and Ohio rivers. The shop brings a worldly vibe to the night mar-
ket and the prints astound shoppers with their beauty and attention to detail.
Sorcery Science: This shop specializes in all things science related — but for 
jewelry. The shop is known for its molecular structure jewelry, with necklaces 
and earrings of caffeine, estrogen, and testosterone molecules, anatomical 
jewelry, with brain earrings and a necklace of a heart, and even periodic table 
quilts and a portable chess board. The chess board and all jewelry are laser 
cut and are perfect gifts for the science nerds in your life.
Songbird Artistry: Formerly known as Jenn’s Jems, the mother-daughter–run 
shop makes unique jewelry and ties inspired by pop culture hits like Harry 
Potter, Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, and more. Songbird Artistry also sells 
Pittsburgh-inspired items as a beautiful homage to their roots, and makes 
screen-printed shirts and onesies of their designs for artists ranging from The 
Avett Brothers, Mumford and Sons, Taylor Swift, and Ed Sheeran.
Papyrusaurus: Papyrusaurus is known for their “handmade goods with a 
geeky kick,” selling unique prints over vintage book pages with designs from 
Wicked, Harry Potter, Supernatural, Doctor Who, Firefly, and more. They also 
sell earrings of little books and cute pins featuring covers of books as part 
of their Tiniest Book Club collection, as well as buttons and cards with their 
unique designs.
Strange Hours Atelier: A spiritual and tarot-themed store with “a keen 
interest in natural and unnatural history,” the patches that it sells feature 
designs inspired by tarots and the stars. The store also sells elaborate hats 
and buttons of their designs as well as intaglio etchings, a traditional form of 
printmaking.
Hip Modern Soap Co.: Hip Modern Soap Co. sells soap that is “vegan, sus-
tainable, cruelty-free, God-fearin’, child-rearin’, pants-droppin’, eye-poppin’, 
out-of-rhymes Steel City goodness.” Soap scents include the bright and col-
orful Carnival Soap, the cool and collected Watermelon Soap, the enigmatic 
blue Sherlock, and the fittingly fresh Fresh Fig Soap. The store also sells body 
butter and sugar scrubs.
In addition to featuring local Pittsburgh vendors and shops, the Night Market 
presented performances highlighting more of Asia’s rich and diverse culture. 
Carnegie Mellon’s own K-Pop Dance Club opened the night with their fun 
routines and Tuika’s Polynesian Island Magic lit up the street with their master-
ful performance of the Samoan Fire Knife Dance. Live bands such as Steel City 
Ukuleles and The King Fez Band also played music throughout the night next 
to the variety of food trucks at the market, which ranged from the handcrafted 
and unique Stickler’s Ice Pops to the classic and delicious Pgh Crepes to Wok 
of Life Pgh, a healthy stir-fry food truck playing into the Market’s Asian theme.
Pittsburgh’s come a long way, and the Squirrel Hill Night Market was truly a 
vibrant celebration on Pittsburgh life and Pittsburgh Asian life, highlighting 
the city’s history and bringing together the community and the various cul-
tures the town loves to embrace. So congrats Pittsburgh, you’ve made it!

Drawings to Forget
Solo art show at the Frame Gallery is minimalist and surreal
“Drawings to Forget” was a solo drawing show put on by Paul Peng, a fifth-year BCSA fine 
arts and computer science student. The show ran in Carnegie Mellon’s student gallery, The 
Frame, for the past two weeks, opening on Sept. 9 and closing on Sunday, Sept. 18. The 
series of drawings profiles the lives of two fictional protagonists: “Stephen Thundermaw, 
great-great-grandson of werewolf demigod and pharmaceutics pioneer and entrepreneur 
Rainbow Jenkins Thundermaw” and “Demyxtro “Demi” Jackson Crystalheart, a dragon-
halfling hybrid with traces of water spirit, ex-partner.” Peng portrayed these eccentric and 
fanciful characters in a style that was both cleanly minimal, but also intensely surreal. All 
beings depicted in his works verged on the domain of pseudo-furry fanfic, and he indulged 
in both the traditional medium of charcoal drawing and internet based meme culture. This 
duality allowed him to inscribe these characters with interesting personas. Throughout the 
drawings the characters oscillated between realistic human traits and fanciful furry personas, 
raising questions of which is more real or accurate to the being beneath the external traits.
This show worked with the traditional medium of drawing and the traditional format of the 
white-wall gallery exhibition, and embraced those to their fullest with great success. The 
minimalist display of these works and the balancing of the composition of light and dark 
areas within worked with the composition of each square paper on the wall. The works were 
often intensely chaotic with a single empty area, or intensely barren with a single dark form, 
allowing for certain details to become hyper aware for the viewer and others to feel like 
they’re being intentionally obfuscated. All together this show was a unique exploration of 
millennial internet culture through the lens of traditional, well composed charcoal drawings. 
The balance between the elegance of Peng’s visual style with the wildly eccentric narrative of 
the works bridges a middle ground that makes the works surprisingly real and telling of the 
world of those raised on the internet.

The class ends. A bustle of students head down the hall 
in a frenzy to go elsewhere. It seems an endless cycle at 
this point. Get up, go to class, leave, go home, and sleep. 
Get up, go to class, sit. 
The desk has another line of writing on it, in the same 
pencil as mine. But the handwriting has curvy ts and con-
nected letters. It’s elegant.
“Semester ends next week, you know,” 
she had written over my last answer. The 
fact that we wouldn’t share the desk anymore 
was implied.
I erased a small patch in the corner of the 
desk and attached an arrow from the last 
message;
“Hi. I’m Emily,” it reads. I smile and pull my pencil out of 
my bag, entirely disregarding the lesson.
“How are you?”
The next days, weeks, and a couple of months pass. The desk is covered in scribbles and arrows, drawings and smudges, where we 
erased bits of the conversation so we could write new ones.
“What’s your favorite color, Emily?” A snippet of a mes-
sage trails toward the top left corner of the beaten wood.
“It’s turquoise,” was spelled out next to my question the 
following day. “Yours?”
“Red.”
I got up and walked out of the class, not caring what 
other people were doing or saying until a person I hadn’t 
noticed accidentally knocked my papers to the floor. I 
shook my head in exasperation and started to kneel to 
pick them up, when a girl with dark brown hair, a small 
smile, and blue eyes knelt next to me, helping me.
“Thanks.”
“No problem,” She holds out her hand for a 
handshake,
 “I’m Emily.”

Desk Art
I slam my door and shuffle down the stairs toward mobs of college students trying 
to get to their first class. It’s an agonizing process to get anywhere, but eventually 
the amoeba of people spits me out in front of my classroom. I walk in and sit in the 
back left corner. The professor starts to drone about the class syllabus moments 
later, and I stare blankly at the open expanse of finished wood in front of me, not 
really thinking. I pull out a pencil and touch it to the surface of the desk, writing:
Art by Theodore  Teichman | Visual Editor
“Hi. I’m Zachary.”
I’m guessing that moving is no one’s favorite thing to do. I probably hate it as much as the 
next person, except I’ve done it about ten times so far. Every time, it’s packing up boxes, 
throwing out things you didn’t even know you had, and starting everything over again. People 
think that means starting relationships or getting used to a new house, and it does; but it also 
means re-acclimating to little things. Things like what your neighborhood looks like on a dark 
night, when shops are open in town, where the heck you put your front door key when you 
tossed it into your room...
Try doing that twice in one year. The moment you start feeling comfortable, you have to leave everything 
behind, again. I don’t care about today, which is what seems like my billionth first day of classes. I don’t care 
about the a cappella auditions poster on my door, or the kid running for house council president down the hall, 
or the weird look my RA gave me when I exited my room in pajamas. I just want to get through today.

---------------------------------------------------

Life has its ups and its downs. Somedays you feel worse 
off than other days and sometimes life hits you with 
something that makes you feel like that for months on 
end. Mike (Jon Favreau) — deprecating protagonist 
of Doug Liman’s Swingers — is going through one of 
these periods in his life. He is a standup comic who 
has moved to LA to find work, but has not met with 
any success, and on top of that he is coming out of 
a six year relationship. His life is in shambles. In this 
backdrop, his friends Rob (Ron Livingston), Trent (Vince 
Vaughn), and Sue (Patrick Van Horn) try to cheer him 
up by taking him out to bars, clubs, and diners to meet 
new girls.
I love the way this film begins: the opening scene is set 
in a diner with Mike and Rob sitting in a booth. Mike 
says to Rob:  “Okay, so what if I don’t want to give up on 
her?” Rob: “You don’t call.”  Mike:  “But you said I don’t 
call if I wanted to give up on her!” Rob: “Right.”
This scene tells us so much: it establishes the setting, 
the plot and the mood. It introduces us to the 
protagonist Mike, and tells us that he keeps brooding 
about a girl, and that his friends are trying to help him 
get over it. Most importantly though, the scene gives 
us a taste of the kind of humor to come.
The film can be accurately described as a comedy 
drama, and it is hilarious. For example consider the 
things that happen when Trent convinces Mike to 
go to Vegas. They both suit up and drive to Vegas 
from Los Angeles so that they can show up as high 
rollers and get all the free comps. They start the 
trip enthusiastically shouting, “Vegas, baby, Vegas!” 
However, on the long drive there, their enthusiasm 
mellows down to nothing. Instead of the crazy ride 
there, we see what really happens on drives to far off 
places — drowsiness and stops at seedy gas stations. 
When they get there we see their stylish entry into a 
casino only to find old people playing slots with Mike 
describing the place accurately as “dead.”  This is the 
first film that I have found that accurately describes 
what happens when young people go to Vegas. They 
go into the casino with the expectation of a crazy time 
only to find old people playing slots and to make a fool 
of themselves at the gambling tables. The Vegas scenes 
also show us for the first time Mike and Trent’s attempts 
at getting with girls.
We see how Trent is a natural at this, but Mike fails 
miserably. The rest of the film shows how Trent, Mike, 
and friends hit up various bars and parties across LA in 
search of women. Typically, this is followed with Mike 
messing things up really quickly. See what happens 
when Mike does muster up the courage to go and talk 
to a girl. He says hi and she asks what kind of car he 
drives. Ashen-faced, he names the type of his broken 
down car and then shouts that it’s red, it’s a red car 
before turning away embarrassed. This scene is quickly 
followed by Trent talking to a girl, getting her number 
and then tearing the number up as he walks away from 
her. The next time they go out, Mike does manage 
to get a girls number. However, in one of the most 
excruciatingly painful scenes in the movie, we see how 
Mike desperately leaves the girl five to six messages on 
her phone the night he meets her before the girl picks 
up and asks him never to call her again.
In between all these mess ups on Mike’s part, his 
friends are constantly trying to pick him up by saying 
things like, “Baby, you’re so money and you don’t even 
know it!” It’s their way of saying that Mike has so much 
going for him and yet he fails to see it. The characters in 
this movie have a language of their own. They refer to 
girls as “beautiful babies” and whenever something is 
impressive they say “that’s so money!” Not to mention 
the things they say to pick up girls, including “this is the 
guy behind the guy behind the guy.” Most of it doesn’t 
make sense and the movie makes fun of that.
Through all the jokes and missteps though, the movie 
has an important message to impart. It reminds us of 
the importance of friends: Trent, Rob, and Sue try their 
best to help Mike meet girls so that he forgets about 
his girlfriend. This movie truly shows how your friends 
are there for you when you’re going through a rough 
patch. How they constantly keep trying to lift your 
mood and remind you that, “Baby, you’re so money!”

Through comedy and drama, this Doug Liman film shares an important message.
