Save It for the People 
The Manchester Bridge
Problems of City
by MURRAY SINGER
In the first of two separate meetings with Pittsburgh’s 
mayoralty candidates, CMU students were addressed last 
Thursday by John Tabor. Before accepting questions from 
the audience, Mr. Tabor discussed some of the problems 
that he would face as mayor, and proposed various solutions 
to these problems.
by JENIFER DIGBY
Two years ago a number of 
CMU architects organized Group 
STL whose crusade it has been 
to^'save Point State Park for the 
people.” The state, who acquired 
ownership of the Park from the 
city, plans to turn the area into 
a sort of formal garden, set in 
the historical framework of Re­
volutionary War Days. It seems 
that the powers that be have even 
refused the contribution of a 
piece of sculpture by world- 
renowned Alexander Calder. His 
work simply would not be in 
keeping with the Park’s propos­
ed context. The DAR, too, has 
had some influence. 1
Those worthy ladies want the 
Park to represent the glorious 
past of pioner Pittsburgh, and 
nothing but. The State, in addi­
tion, thinks that a large round 
fountain at the Point would be 
nice. Group STL thinks that the 
Park should be a place of art 
and interest. People should be 
free to use the banks of the ri­
vers to sun themselves and the 
Park’s natural arena for sport 
and recreation. People should not 
be chased out of the park by a
7.00 p.m. curfew. And the Group 
also feels that a foundtain would 
be a very ludicrous statement 
at the juncture of three great wa­
tery rivers.
The State has other interest­
ing plans for the Park. They 
plan to demolish the Point and 
Manchester gridges leading from 
the Point to the South and North 
Sides. Contracts have already been 
let to get rid of the two bridges. 
It is estimated that the Manches­
ter demonition along will cost 
more than $1,100,000. The Point 
will cost even more. STL would 
like to see the bridges used for 
something, not torn down. They 
have suggested that the Point 
Bridge might stand as a “cathe­
dral for peace.” The Manches­
ter, however, does provide access 
to the site of the new North Side 
Stadium. If renovated, the Bridge 
would be useful in detracting 
the heavy traffic from the 
Bridge to Somewhere and, the 
Sixth Street Bridge. The archi­
tects also picture extending the 
Parks onto the Manchester, with 
shops and concessions — a sort of 
American Pointa Vecchio.
Here the plot thickens. The 
Group people have discovered 
that one Burrell Cohen, who pre­
viously had been Executive Di­
rector of the Stadium Authority 
and Chairman of the Stadium 
Traffic. Parking and Transpor­
tation Committee, has resigned 
those posts to head PITSTAD, 
an independant corporation which 
holds exculsively all Stadium con­
cessions and the plans for a river 
taxi as well. In its report on tran­
sportation to the new Stadiurp. 
The Stadium Authority has 
claimed that there presently ex­
ists no other access to the site. 
(See photo) All of which leads 
us to believe that politics figures 
importantly in the decision to 
destroy the bridge.
Group STL has planned a ral­
ly for next Sunday afternoon at 
the Park. They hope to drum up 
support for an injunction against 
the destruction of the Manches­
ter Bridge. So far they have the 
unofficial blessing of the His­
tory and Landmarks Society, 
and radio plugging from Jim 
Quinn at KQV. KDKA has prom­
ised to send a camera to the rally, 
and may use the footage on their 
Sunday afternoon show, Bi-Fo- 
cal.
Involved in the Group STL 
are Delbert Hylands, head of the 
department of Architecture, An­
toni de Chicchis, Robert Lepper, 
Jim Lesco, Joe Nicholson, 
and Tryo West. Mr. West said that
if the bridge is saved, and the 
Park made into a Park for the 
people, it will be the first time 
we will have been successful in 
a move against the city decision­
makers in favor of the desires of 
the people. ‘‘The old establish­
ment,” said West ‘ has killed the 
city.-' Group STL is trying to 
make at least one part of it 
come alive.
Group STL has received sup­
port from the Carnegie-Insti- 
ute and the Pittsburgh City Coun­
cil. The Pittsburgh Art Institute 
will vote this week on whether 
or not they will support the 
Group’s efforts.

“The Doer” told the audience 
that he wanted to mobilize Pitts­
burgh’s financial, intellectual 
and ethnic strength and to change 
the city from a politically stag­
nant to a politically progressive 
one. Despite eleven tax increas­
es over the past fifteen years, 
Pittsburgh has operated at a $3,
000,000 deficit over the past year. 
Pittsburgh’s 47 per cent increase 
in the crime rate far exceeded 
the national average of 19 per 
cent. Racial tensions have come to 
a head in the building indus­
try and in the high schools. 
Mr. Tabor stated that the failures 
of the Barr administration must 
be overcome. He pointed out that 
his opponent had been an integral 
part of that administration.
To overcome the financial de­
ficit, Tabor promised to “cut 
unnecessary fat” and to end free- 
loading in .City Hall. He pledged 
$5 million from the existing city 
payroll to the budget. He hopes to 
secure assistance from Allegheny 
County for the Central City, and 
also to secure aid from the State 
and Federal governments. To
preempt the ever-increasing crime 
rate, Tabor stressed the need to 
get to the roots of the problem 
by attempting to improve educa­
tion and curbing poverty. He
also supported strong and fair
law enforcement in the mean­
time. Tabor listed 13 proposals 
which would compromise his
program against crime.
Aiming at the problem of ra­
cial conflict, Mr. Tabor told the

audience that one of the chief 
factors was the simultaneous de­
velopment of a black rage and a 
fear on the part of the white 
population. For example, blacks 
experience outrage at their low 
employment levels while whites 
fear loss of jobs.
Mr. Tabor feels that one ap­
proach to the construction crisis 
was to support programs for on- 
the-job training, instead of pro­
viding trainees with no guarantee 
of jobs after tarining has been 
completed. For the development 
of new housing, Tabor hopes that 
federal support will be made avail­
able and that large parcels of 
land would be employed.
A large part of the hour was 
devoted to questions. The first 
asked what might be done about 
apparant hostility of the Tac­
tical Police Force toward stu­
dents and Negros. Tabor agreed 
tha the TPF must be a strong but 
not oppressive group.
Asked why he had not taken a 
stand on the construction issue, 
Tabor replied that he certainly 
had. He felt that the matter should 
not be settled in the streets but 
at the conference tables. He 
admitted that discrimination ex­
ists in some unions but that admis­
sion to the union should only be 
based on skill. He opposes the 
notion of an 8-month training pro­
gram for blacks while whites 
still have the 4-year apprentice­
ship program to contend with.

Here Thurs.
Mr. Peter Flaherty, the man who bucked the Democratic machine 
to run for mayor of Pittsburgh, will talk at the Y’s Noon Forum this 
Thursday at 12:30 in the WherrettRoom
Dubbed “Peter Silent” by a Pittsburgh radio commentator, and 
accused of continuing to deal only with Democratic party issues by 
his opponent, “Pete” has yet to show that he can offer the city a new 
and independent administration. Polls show him in the lead, however, 
probably because of the city’s strong democratic majority. He may con­
tinue to be attractive to the young, liberal element in the city be­
cause of his identification with the McCarthy movement at the Chic­
ago Democratic Convention.
The forum Thursday at 12:30 is open to all, who may bring their 
lunches. There will be ample time for questions.

In describing his attitude to­
ward the Moratorium, Mr. Ta­
bor agreed that it is all right to 
demonstrate but that the rights 
of others must be observed. Al­
though he feels that we should 
get out of Vietnam as soon as 
possible, he stated that this would 
not be one of his major concerns 
as mayor. His support for a with­
drawal is based upon a hope that 
some of the current defense 
spending will be directed to the 
cities.
Tabor told another question­
er that he favors the concept of 
an elected schoolboard, but that 
this will not be a feasible plan 
until the end of the current fi­
nancial crisis. He opposes in­
stitutional taxes, claiming, for ex­
ample, that they make it difficult 
for students to attend private 
colleges.
Tabor was asked whether he 
though the University should be 
politically active. He replied 
that the first function of the 
school was to educate the mind, 
but that students should not be 
isolated from the community. 
One should choose for oneself 
whether to be active or not.
Dealing with narcotics, Tabor 
stated that he feels that children 
should be educated about the 
hazards of the use of drugs, star­
ting at the age of twelve. He 
supports better treatment for ad­
dicts and the acquisition of fed­
eral funds for rehabilitation pro­
grams. He hopes that a crack­
down on drug traffic can be af­
fected.

tion story, tune in at the Y-For- 
um next Thursday when Pete

er.

A Successful Weekend
Page 4 — THE TARTAN — Tuesday, October 28, 1969
Homecoming 1969
by JERRY KLEINMAN
For the first time on our cam­
pus a big weekend was held with­
out the financial support of the 
Administration. The student com­
mittee, realizing that they had an 
obligation to Student Senate, the 
Activities Board and the rest of 
the year’s social calendar, pro­
vided a weekend of entertainment 
that would fit both the students’ 
desires and Mr. McCurdy’s bud­
get. They came through with 
flying colors.
Fifteen hundred people crow­
ded into Skibo Friday night for 
what was perhaps the finest 
single night of entertainment ever 
on campus. “Your Father’s Mus­
tache” playing in the Tartan 
“Honky Tonk,” created an atmos­
phere and reaction that has been 
sorely missed at CMU. They 
showed students how to have a 
good time at Skibo, and that alone 
is a crowning achievement.
Undaunted by the fact that they 
had to wait outside for the de­
layed concerts, the students seem­
ed to enjoy both performances 
of “The Free Design.” Relati­
vely unknown on campus, the 
group seemed to gain many fans, 
as evidenced by the capacity 
turnouts in the Ballroom. Those in 
attendance tuned in by just sit­
ting back and relaxing, a de­
finite change of pace from the 
Grill, where active participation 
was the thing.
A long overdue football victory 
with Jan Wilkinson crowned 
Homecoming Queen set the scene 
for the Saturday night concert. 
Past concerts have tried to satisfy 
different student tastes by having 
radically different performers on 
state. “Chicago” seemed to 
create different types of music, 
ones that most people in the au­
dience could enjoy.
The Post-concert entertain­
ment was provided by a joint 
MDC-AWS dance and coffee 
house in Skibo and at numerous 
fraternity parties.
The Homecoming Committee 
would like to take this oppor­
tunity to thank those students who 
supported the weekend, and to re­
mind those who didn’t that unless 
the Activities Board is supported
by the CMU student body, it will 
not have the financial base with 
which to present major entertain­
ment. It is never desireable to 
have pbulic sales for a campus 
event, yet without them the rest of 
the year’s social calendar would 
have been doomed. By support­
ing the entire Activities Board 
program you ensure a continued 
entertainment calendar that will 
provide events for everyone.
The 1969 homecoming commit­
tee was as follows: Steering com­
mittee, Jerry Kleinman (chair­
man,), Alan Spinrad, Lou De- 
Toro; Secretary, Emily Cutler; 
Treasuerer, Jeff Ruben; Publi­

dine Slaven, Phil Meyer, Frank 
Korbett; Saturday entertainment, 
Jimmy Jacks; Sorority skits, Jane 
Fordyce; Bonfire, Mark Krauland; 
and Queens, Linda Worthington, 
Carole Kalinski. The committee 
wishes to thank Mr. McCurdy, 
Mr. Grebos, Mrs. Rudman, Mrs. 
Londergan, and Mr. Meloro.

by TOM DAVIS
First of all, let me say that there were two different 
moods at each of the two concerts. At the Free Design con­
cert, there was an air of peace and calm, believe it or not, 
amongst the overall confusion and disjointedness that prevades 
Skibo Hall. At the Chicago concert it was disbelief. Disbelief 
that the football team had won for once, and disbelief over 
the just fantastic sound that Chicago was laying down.
The Free Design concert star­
ted a little late (if you con­
sider a half an hour “little”). 
But when they did come, they just 
got on the stage and SANG. They 
didn’t overpower you with sound 
but the sound they made was 
just so nice. They had an organ, 
two guitars, some horns and a 
drummer. And it was just NICE!
The songs they sang were 
somewhere between Simon & 
Garfunkel and Harry Nillson. 
They sang about things like love, 
and umbrellas, and flying kites, 
you know, just.. . songs.
The songs that I liked the best 
were the “Umbrella Song(?)” 
which featured a little drum solo 
that reminded me of Ginger 
Baker (rock fan that I am), and 
“Michelle.” “Michelle” was just
to nice that I could have listen­
ed to it for the rest of the night.
I can’t say a lot of superlatives 
about the Free Design like “stu­
pendous” or “incredible” because 
they didn’t “blowl you over” or 
excite you to the point of “stu­
pendous” or “incredible.”
They were just nice.
Chicago was a different mat­
ter. After last October (or was 
it August ?) I didn’t think any­
thing good could come out of 
Chicago. But their Transit Au­
thority is just unbelievable.
From the minute they came 
on the stage, they started some­
thing. They weren’t deafeningly 
loud like Gun or Jimi Hendrix, but 
I was still expecting my father to 
call up and say “turn that blas­
ted crap off or down.”
But what can I say? You just 
had to be there to believe it. It 
was just fantastic. They just 
walked away for an hour. They 
used somebody else’s song for the 
first time I’ve ever heard. They 
did “I’m a Man” which was 
originally done by Spencer Davis, 
(no relation) I though Spencer Da­
vis did it pretty well but Chic­
ago just absolutely destroyed it. 
It moved and pulsated and when 
they finished and hurried off 
state, it was maybe fifteen seconds 
before I realized that they were 
gone.
Then during the intermission, 
they announced the Homecoming 
Queen. They announced each run- 
ner-up, and after each name, 
there was wild applause from 
two people sitting under the first 
balcony (me and some guy in 
wire-rim glasses.)
Then Chicago came back. 
And they played MY SONG!!!
. . . which just happens to be 
“Poem 58” After this, I was ready 
to take off without wings or 
speed or LSD or anything. They 
did “Question 67 and 68” and it 
was just fantastic! Then they 
went into their “Break Song” 
which riffed all over the place 
for about twenty minutes. Terry 
Kath has got to be unbelievable 
on guitar. And while he’s no 
Ginger Baker, Daniel Seraphine 
can really set up some fantastic, 
quasi.conga rhythms on the drums. 
He just puts his head down and 
gases. Seaphine threw away a 
drumstick, knocked over a cymbal 
and destroyed a head on a drum. 
Kath just broke his shoulder 
strap once.
O.K. . . . that’s three “fantas- 
tics” and “two” unbelievables” 
and the C.T.A. deserved each one 
of them. They can now accept 
their place on my list of “Groups 
Whose Albums I would Take As 
A Gift.”

Letter to the Editor
Blood Drive
Editor, The Tartan:
I am writing this letter as a 
concerned student who believes 
in any and all humanitarian ac­
tions taken by this college com­
munity. The Gamma Sigma blood
drive is such an action but I 
would urge all students and 
faculty not to sign the form for 
donation of blood and not to do­
nate if that form is required. I 
have given blood seven times in 
the past two years, and although

slip I have never seen or signed

The slip here, in effect, places

the student is left with no legal

Do you think a bright young engineer 
should spend 
his most imaginative years on 
the same assignment?
Neither do we.
That’s why we have a two- 
year Rotation Program for 
graduating engineers who 
would prefer to explore several 
technical areas. And that’s why 
many of our areas are organ­
ized by function—rather than 
by project.
At Hughes, you might 
work on spacecraft, communi­
cations satellites and/or tacti­
cal missiles during your first 
two years.
All you need is an EE, ME 
or Physics degree and talent.
If you qualify, we'll arrange for 
you to work on several different 
assignments.. .and DEF can 
help pick them.
You may select special­
ized jobs, or broad systems- 
type jobs. Or you can choose 
not to change assignments if 
you’d rather develop in-depth 
skills in one area.
Either way, we think 
you’ll like the Hughes ap­
proach.
It means you’ll become 
more versatile in a shorter 
time. r-------------------

Ralph Ellison: 
"The Novelist 
And the City"
by ANDILIEBERMAN
Ralph Ellison, black novelist, 
lecturer and essayist, and author 
of The Invisible Man, spoke to 
Carnegie Mellon students and 
faculty on October 23 in the 
Skibo Ballroom. The topic of 
discussion was “The Novelist 
and the City.”
In a speech that was at times 
incohesive, Mr. Ellison describ­
ed the connection between the 
novel and the city. He portray­
ed the city as a “last hope” for 
the novelist and the novel as a 
means of dealing with the com­
plexity of the city. Mr. Elli­
son described, in particular, 
the relationship between the black 
novelist and the city.
The novel, according to Mr. 
Ellison, is a form of memory 
that retains the ideals of the city 
which get lost in the structure of 
its society, and transforms it in­
to meaningful reality. It reduces 
the city to a “dimension of con­
sciousness.”
The city is an ideal location for 
the novelist; it is a place where 
he can leave the ties and preju­
dices of home and test his own 
individuality. It offers him the 
freedom to be himself while learn­
ing and recording the life styles 
of others.
As a black nationalist, Mr. 
Ellison reaps a particular bene­
fit from the city. Since little 
has been written about black re­
lations to society, Mr. Ellison 
uses the folklore of blacks in the 
city as a source of much of his 
writing. He attempts to show 
how black experience infiltra­
tes the experience of others. He 
avoids creating a mythology of the 
city in which blacks are the 
scapegoats and less than human.”
A question and answer period 
followed the speech. An infor­
mal seminar was held at 7:00 
p.m. the same evening in the 
Wherrett Room at Skibo.

Nagrin To Appear F. Y. Liberal
Daniel Nagrin, dance coloist, will appear at Carnegie Thea­
ter, College of Fine Arts on Saturday, Nov. 1. under the sponsorship 
of the Department of Drama. Critics and audiences, alike have found 
it a challenge to classify or even describe the work of Daniel Na­
grin. All agree he is a leader in the modern dance field, a virtuoso 
technician, a brilliant performer and the creator of a completely in­
dividual style. ------------------------------------------------
Mr. Nagrin will present his 
one-man show “The Peloopon- 
nesian War,” a dance theatre 
collage, created and performed 
to the Text of Thucydides celebra­
ted history of the thirty years war 
between Athens and Sparta. A 
full evening's performance, the 
work is possibly the longest solo 
dance theatre piece around a single 
theme, ever created. The score 
has original music by Eric Salz- 
man and Archie Shepp and a 
tape collage assembled by Mr.
Salzman and Mr. Nagrin.
Mr. Nagrin has appeared as yhe 
leading dancer on Broadway in 
“Annie Get Your Gun,” “Touch 
and Go, ’Lend an Ear, and Plain the repertoire, 
and Fancy.” For the last, he 
was voted the “Oscar” of Broad­
way, the Donaldson Award as 
the Best Male Dancer of the year 
and Maurice Zolotov of Theater 
Arts hailed him as “ .... the
most exciting male dancer of the 
musical stage since Gene Kelly."
Off-Broadway, he staged the 
movement for the award-winning 
production of Zweig's “Volpone." 
the experimental “Firebugs" by 
Max Frisch and for the Boston 
Arts Festival he choreographed 
O'Neil s “The Emperor Jones.” 
with James Earl Jones in the 
lead.
Finally in 1958, going against 
the trend of larger and larger 
dance companies, he presented in 
concert a complete solo program. 
Since then he has been touring

uously creating new works for

“Bring the War Home” that was the cry that a dimunative girl 
was using as she passed out SDS material in front of Skibo during a 
TGIF. After talking to her for a while. I realized that her’s was the 
most dogmatic attitude that I had ever confronted. She immediately 
branded my father as a pig after finding out that he was a career 
Army Officer. She told it as she thought it was. but I know my fa­
ther a hell of a lot better than she does, and I know that he is far from 
being a Pig in any definition of the word.
After talking to this little bundle of charm. I was determined
to go to the publicized meeting of Steel City SDS. This group,
the “weathermen.” was a militant off shoot of the Students for De­
mocratic Society. At the meeting I listened to a speech by an indi­
vidual who was preaching open treason and sedition. “War in the 
street." "Kill the Pigs."“Bust their skulls." “Show the sons of 
bitched were It’s at” were some of the catchy phrases being used by 
this young activist while exercising his free dom of speech. The pur­
pose of his talk was to gain support for the coming SDS demonstra­
tion In Chicago, a demonstration which was to be anything but peace­
ful. This was to be an attack against the home of Pigdom (as they 
referred to Chicago). It was to be concurrent with the trial of the 
“Chicago Eight,” who had been charged with inciting a riot in 
the Chicago distrubances during the Democratic National Conven­
tion. This latter day Che explained how the “Battle” would be con­
ducted. I was slowly getting nauseated, but I stayed to see if there 
was any more information that he had to impart upon me. When ask­
ed what will occur if the revolution is successful, the speaker answer­
ed that there were no plans for the Government. With that answer 
my friend fulfilled the final requirement in the Webster definition of 
an anarchist. And with that declaration I left the meeting not
understanding how people can actually believe that they were accom­
plishing anything of value by fighting the Chicago Police Depart­
ment.
Pipes, helmets, knives, and chains. These articles of war seem ra­
ther incongruous with a generation that has produced the peace and 
love of Greenwich Village, Georgetown, Woodstock and Shady- 
side (?????) The kind of gentle youth was gathered in Chicago last 
week, led by the illustrious Mard Rudd, armed with steel helmets 
and lead pipes for a “peaceful demonstration” put 26 policemen in the 
hospital in one day. Only one “weatherman” was injured. This figure 
leads to two possible conclusions. Either the weathermen were much 
better street fighters than the Chicago police, or the police in an ef­
fort to avoid the brutality and the stigma of last year’s riots used ex­
treme restraint to the extent that they were overwhelmed by the pre­
pared weathermen. I feel the latter has a higher probability of truth. 
In one action the weathermen changed the nation’s attitude 
towards the Chicago police Department from one “Shame” to one of 
confusion and possible support. Rudd is under arrest for attempted 
murder, since one of the injured is paralyzed from the neck down.
The idea of armed revolt in the United States is so repulsive to 
me that I can not speak loudly enough against it. In constrast with 
the Chicago fiasco, the Moratorium was a right and proper use of the 
freedom of speech. Whether or not you agree with the Moratorium, 
the fact that such an event can be held is a tribute to the freedoms 
that exist in our country. With the right of free speech, anarchists 
are allowed to spreak their posion. It is each person’s individual re­
sponsibility to use his own intelligence and own conscience in evalua­
ting the different arguments on the question of the war, or any other 
problem.

Group Going to NYC Male and Female Groups Merge 
To Work for Lindsay To Form Junior Co-ed Honorary
Many Pittsburghers, permanent 
residents as well as those “in 
transience,” think that re-elect­
ing John Lindsay as Mayor of 
New York City is important not 
only to New York but also to the 
nation. To demonstrate their sup­
port and actively work for Lind­
say in the mayorality race, a bus­
load of Pittsburgh area people 
will travel to New York, Friday, 
October 31.
The bus will leave the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh Student Union 
^(Schenley Hall) Friday at 5 p.m. 
It will leave New York City 
to return to Pittsburgh Tuesday, 
November 4, at 11 p.m. A contri­
bution of $5 to pay for the bus is 
being asked from all those making 
the trip. Accommodations in pri­
vate homes will be provided at 
no cost.
The group will be canvassing 
the City, helping to get out the
vote on Tuesday, as well as par­
ticipating in a walking tour 
sponsored by Mayor Lindsay.
This action by Pittsburgh area 
residents is being supported by 
State Representative Gerald Kauf­
man (Democrat of Squirrel Hill) 
Molly Yard, Chairman of the Pitts­
burgh Americans for Democratic 
Action, and Thomas Kerr, Lec­
turer of Indistrial Administration 
at Carnegie-Mellon University.
Those interested in going to 
New York should contact Jon 
Robinson at either 687-2937 or 
621-3500 extension 369. Reserva­
tions may be made by send­
ing your name, address, phone 
number and $5 to Jon Robison, 
Department of Urban Affairs, 
Graduate School of Public and 
International Affairs, University 
of Pittsburgh.
Checks should be made payable 
to Professor John Cunningham.
Last Tuesday night at a meeting in Skibo, Phi Tau Gam­
ma and Delta Skull joined forces. The original intention of 
the joint meeting of the two honoraries was to find out if they 
could work together in a tutoring project. What grew out 
of the meeting, however, was much greater. The two groups 
(junior male and female honoraries) decided to revive flagging 
interest by uniting as one organization — a co-ed junior hon­
orary for service. -----------------------------------------------
MARCH FOR PEACE NOW
WASHINGTON, D.C. • NOVEMBER 15th
Each group had found its big­
gest obstacle in inter-group apa­
thy. Both were finding it difficult 
to get a tutoring project off the 
ground. Basically, members just 
weren’t interested in tutoring, 
or even in being in any honorary 
that actually did something. Be­
sides, there didn’t really seem to 
be a crying need for tutors, and 
the red tape of getting to the few 
freshmen who need help was 
virtually insurmountable for one 
small group or even for two 
small separate groups.
Tne nybrid group that emerged 
Tuesday night, however, did 
agree that there were other areas 
on and off campus that a strong 
organization might serve. As a star­
ter, the two groups agreed to re­
search the problem of replacing 
Woodlawn pharmacy.

to investigate the creation of a 
cosmetic and non-prescription 
drug concession somewhere on 
campus. The campus drugstore 
would be a place where students 
could cash checks on weekends, 
pick up magazines, band-aids, 
aspirin, newspapers, etc. Since
the demise of Woodlawn, campus 
residents must walk blocks into 
Oakland or Shadyside to get to 
the nearest drugstore.
Other projects hopefully will 
follow this first one, including 
perhaps a revision of the con­
stitutions of both organiza­
tions and/or the creation of a 
totally new constitution provid­
ing for one junior honorary for 
CMU students — male and female.
The new group will meet again 
on Tuesday, November 4, at 10:00 
p.m. in room 39 Skibo.
Swank Elaborates 
On B.C.C. Issue
Dean Swank held an open 
meeting on Thursday afternoon 
to discuss the Black Construction 
Coalition (BCC) issue. He stated 
that the Tartan (10/21) had given 
a fairly comprehsneive picture of 
progress to date, but wished to 
elaborate somewhat on the story, 
and answer any subsequent ques­
tions students or faculty might 
have.
Swank said that the University 
has received no response as yet to 
the telegrams sent to the Presi­
dent and the Attorney General. 
The University should follow up 
the issues with letters and conver­
sations with Pa. Senators and 
Representatives. Letters have been 
drafted but not yet sent. Also, 
the University has written a let­
ter to the Construction Company, 
(see same issue). Renegotiation, 
we have been advised, is not lik­
ely, however. It has been sug­
gested that the University consult 
other groups for council and as­
sistance in setting up future con­
tracts, etc.
In answer to a question about 
Black recruitment programs for the 
University, Dean Swank said that 
the Administrative Policy Coun­
cil issued a strong directive to 
the Deans and Department 
heads to set up recruitment pro­
cedures. The problem, however, is 
not that easily solved. It is dif­
ficult. after all, to find qualfied
blacks to fill faculty positions. In 
recruiting blacks, the PhD. can­
not be used as a simple formula 
for qualificiation. Besides, we 
are obviously in competition 
with other institutions looking for 
good black teachers. In his own 
Department, said Swank, it is 
realized that competance cannot 
be measured by any degree, but 
rather by the capabilities of the 
man himself. Finding the people, 
and measuring their qualifications 
without the usual criteria, is a 
challenging problem that we must 
meet.
Dean Swank also discussed 
proceedings against the three stu­
dents arrested at the construc­
tion site. He said that no disci­
plinary action has been taken and 
that University attorneys are ex­
ploring ways to limit the injunc­
tion against more than five people 
picketing at a site. Swank comment­
ed that “this University has shown 
that it is committed to faculty 
and students more than many other 
such institutions.” Perhaps the 
communications set-up is a little 
slow, but nevertheless, it exists.
At the conclusion of the meet­
ing. Dean Swank offered to meet 
with any number of students, on 
any issue affecting the University, 
at any time. If open-meetings of 
the sort that facilitating com­
munications, Dean Swank is more 
than willing to make them 
available.

The Tartans dominated the game Saturday and easily defeated Franklin & Marshall 34-13 
before a large Homecoming crowd at the Tech Bowl. It was the team’s first win of the year 
and featured a strong running attack and a good effort by the defensive unit. CMU led in all 
the statistics while rolling over F & M’s defense for 544 yards and taking a commanding 26-0 
lead into the fourth quarter.
Tech took the opening kick- 
off and marched 69 yards for a 6-0 
lead. The drive was entirely on the 
ground with Terry Bell, Tom 
Lombardo, and Rich Squires tak­
ing turns hitting the Diplomat line 
for good gains. Squires scored the 
six points on a sneak from the 
one.
For the remainder of the first 
quarter and most of the second, 
the Tartans moved through the 
F&M defense with relative ease 
but failed to cash in. A number of 
costly 15 yard penalties and three 
turnovers kept CMU out of the 
endzone.
But at the end of the half, 
the Tartans struck quickly and
built up a 20-0 lead. With 1:32 
remaining, Squires hit Rudy Tep­
sic on a 56 yard pass play and 
Bell ran for the two-point con- 
cersion. Seconds later, defensive 
Back Rich Miller picked off a 
pass and gave the Tartans a first 
down on the 19. Tony Bugel scor­
ed on a six yard pass with 50 
seconds remaining in the half.
A 71 yard TD drive in the third 
quarter put the game out of reach 
for the F&M team. Passes from 
Squires to Gubel and Lombardo 
highlighted the offensive effort 
that ended with Bell scoring from 
five yards out.

Larry Shadek passed to Kevin 
Coulter who put on a number of 
good moves while running 61 
yards for the score. It was only 
the second pass completion of 
the afternoon for the Diplomats.
The Tartans came right back 
after F&M unsuccessfully tried 
an onside kick. Defensive back 
Chris O’Leary moved into the of­
fensive unit and helped move the 
ball to the 21, from where 
Bugel took Squires pass away from 
a defender for the touchdown.
The scoring ended for the af­

with Coulter on another long 
play.

Tartans Rise To The Occasion
by AL LETZT
After opening the season with four demoralizing defeats, the Tar­
tans bounced back in the big Homecoming game to whip Franklin 
and Marshall 34-13. The Tech game plan, to establish a running at­
tack early, worked to perfection when the Tartans moved the ball 69 
yards on runs by Terry Bell and Tom Lombardo for their first 
touchdown. The offensive line consistently cut down the F&M de­
fenders on runs up the middle and sweeps around both ends.
With time running out in the first half, Squires went to the air and 
hit Tepsic with a pass on the thirty yard line. When the Diplomat’s 
cornerback gambled on an interception and missed the ball, Rudy took 
off down the sidelines and went in for the score. A half minute later, 
the Tartans got the ball back again and utilized their time outs to give 
Squires a chance to rifle a six yard touchdown pass to Tony Bugel.
The Tartans picked up 372 yards rushing and 172 yards passing 
for 29 first downs. Bell and Lombardo carried the ball 23 times each 
Bell gained 125 yards rushing and Lombardo had 144. Chris O’Leary 
gave Bell a breather later on in the game and he averaged six yards 
per carry. Squires’ three TD passes gives him a total of twelve for the 
season — he threw eithteen last year.
The defense held F&M to a net total of 17 yards rushing. The 
Diplomats gained 171 yards passing but Dick Miller intercepted two 
passes for CMU and Ed Mumont picked off another Diplomat aerial. 
Freshmen linebackers John Sabol and Ray Terza both played a good 
aggressive game and Sabol receovered two fumbles.
Mrk Wood got off his best punt of the year — a 42 yard boot that 
was downed by the Tartans on the F& M one yard line.
Two more names were added to the Tartan injured list. Senior 
lineman and co-captain Denny Morabito injured his foot and defen­
sive lineman Bob Duck sustained a knee injury.
A homecoming crowd of over 4500 Tech students and alumni view­
ed the Tartan ictory. Mark Lang was there to accept an award from 
the alumni for his stellar play on Tech’s basketball teams for the past 
four years.
The Tartans will travel to Baltimore the home of the illustrious 
Bullets, Colts and Orioles to meet Johns Hopkins’ Blue Jays, Satur­
day. CMU holds a 5-1 edge in thisseries.
Linebacker John Sabol puts rush on F&M punter John Brunetti. Sabol 
recovered two fumbles to set up eventual CMU touchdowns.

The C-MU soccer team dropped a 3-1 Homecoming decision to Grove City Saturday on the 
IM field. The loss brought the Tartan’s season record to a respectable 4-3-1. 
The Tartsns’ lone tally came in the first quarter when right inside Carlos Herrman took a 
pass from Jerry Condiliotis and booted it in to give Tech an early 1-0 lead. The lead lasted until 
the second quarter when Grove City tallied. 
Late in the fourth quarter the Wolverines scored two questionable goals to take the game

3-1. On both occasions it appear­
ed that Grove City was offsides, 
but the referees thought other­
wise and let the plays count.
Freshman John Lape put,in 
an excellent performance as 
goalie. He is replacing Jacques 
Borisewitz who broke his leg last 
week. Lape had good support from 
defense, comprised of Eisenman, 
Escott, and Kneisley, who contin­
ually pulled the Grove City team 
offsides.
Halfbacks Moroz, Newick, and 
Sugarman did a good job feeding 
the offensive line throughout most 
of the morning. The strength of 
the well-balanced Grove City 
squad is exemplified by the fact 
that Henrik Palme was held score­
less for only the second time this 
season.
Other starters on the C-MU 
team include Gojman and Orban 
at wings and Kern, Strum, and Pol­
lack at the inside positions.
Pitt-Johnstown visist the Tech 
campus this Saturday morning 
for a 10:30 contest at the Bowl. 
Last year the Tartans easily out- 
scored them in a 7-2 victory 
and much the same can be ex­
pected this year.

Harriers Close Season, 4-5-1 
Manon Sets C-MU Record
by Jim Tomayko
Jon Manon broke the C-MU rec­
ord for the Schenley Park course 
twice last week as the Tartan har­
riers wound up their turbulent 
season. Jon won his sixth straight 
race with a record 22:31 Wednes­
day as Carnegie split a double 
dual meet. Defeating St. Vincent, 
19-42, while losing to Indiana, 
23-33, the runners garnered the 
fastest times of their respective 
careers in a meet noted for ex­
ceptional performances.
Indiana has always been high 
on Carnegie’s list of tough schools. 
The last three meetings have al­
ways produced surprising perfor­
mances, a result of the combina­
tion of late-season conditioning 
and mental preparation.
Undefeated Grove City was the 
last meet on the schedule and ex­
pected to be one of the toughest. A 
GC runner was quoted as saying 
that they considered Carnegie a 
pushover until they had heard 
what the Tartans had done against 
Indiana: “Then the old lump came 
>n my throat.” C-MU did not dis­
appoint either him or his team­
mates.
Carnegie broke well at the start 
and all eight Tartans were in the 
top ten as the pack sailed over 
Flagstaff. Manon began to accel­
erate almost immediately after 
reaching the woods trail, as he 
was trying to outleg the highly- 
reputed Cameron of GC. This 
stretched the race into a thin line 
about 60 yards long.
At the half-way mark. Jon was 
still leading Cameron by 20 yards
but straining. Joe Lorhan and 
Steve Hawkins were close behind, 
as were a pack of three GC run­
ners.
On the stretch of open 
ground before Cobblestone Hill 
Jon Manon was passed for the 
first time this year. Cameron had 
been paced well by Manon, and 
had reserved enough strength to 
open up a lead on the golf course. 
He finished in 22:00 flat, which 
is the fastest time ever recorded 
by a runner opposing C-MU. Man- 
on’s time was 22:30.6, just 
barely under his three-day-old 
standard.
In many ways, the best sur­
prises were yet to come. It was 
another minute before another 
runner appeared: Fox of Grove 
City. Then, almost miraculously, 
Lorhan and Hawkins appeared to­
gether, Lorhan completing the 
course in 23:57 (his fastest) and 
Hawkins in 24:00. Hawkins has 
been having an excellent, albeit 
unheralded year. Lorhan has 
been a continual surprise, as there
seems to be no limit to how much 
he can improve.
Grove City finished in the next 
three places and that effectively 
wrapped up the race. The fresh­
man duo of Pete Hoysan and Den­
nis Sullivan were next, and, after 
another of GC contingent, Larry 
Anderson closed out his career. 
Larry has been an expression of 
what hard work and dedication 
can do for an athlete. His four 
years have been marked by steady 
improvement and consistency. He 
is the kind of runner that is an as­
set to any team, as his example is 
just as important as his point- 
worth.
Wayne Bingham and Jim Tom­
ayko rounded out the Tartan finish­
ers. The final score was 25-30.
The harriers finished the sea­
son 4-5-1, which unfortunately was 
the worst record in a decade, as 
it does not reflect the quality of 
the individual performances and 
the conscientious coaching of 
Gary Meckley.
