Work of Tech Auxiliary
THE MUSIC BY BOWEN
The Red Cross’ Ball is to be held in 
the foyer of Carnegie Music Hall on 
Friday evening of this week, from 8:30 
to 1 o’clock. For the second time this 
year the Music Hall will be the scene 
of one of Tech’s big dances, but this 
time there is an added attraction in 
that the afEair is for the benefit of the 
Red Cross. The Tech Auxiliary of 
that organization is to be formed in 
the Design Theater at 11 o’clock to­
day; it is in their work that the pro­
ceeds of the ball are to be used.
Music for the dance will be provided 
by Bowen’s six-piece orchestra, and 
refreshments are being prepared by 
the girls of the Margaret Morrison 
School. The list of patrons and 
patronesses is as follows:
Director and Mrs. Hamerschlag, 
Director and Mrs. Leete,
Dean and Mrs. Mott,
Dean and Mrs. Bossange,
Dean and Mrs. Connelley,
Dean Mary B. Breed,
Dr. and Mrs. Esquerre,
Professor and Mrs. Keller,
Miss Parry,
Dr. Blair.
The ball is under the supervision of 
¦¦a committee of the Central Council, 
of which Miss Frances Willis is chair­
man. Her committee is being assisted 
by a group of Science Plebes.
M. M. C. S. SENIORS HOLD LAST FORMAL DANCE
The Senior Class of Margaret Mor­
rison held their last formal dance last 
Friday nighh at the Twentieth Cen­
tury Club. Although the evening was 
rainy, almost the whole class was 
there, with Miss Caverly, Miss Parry 
and Miss Collingwood acting as chap­
erons. Supper was served on the 
third floor at 12 o’clock. The music 
consisted of a three-piece orchestra, 
with Rhiel at the piano.
SOUTHERN CLUB WILL 
DISCONTINUE HOUSE
Due to the fact that the majority of 
the Southern Club members who live 
at their house, 5072 Forbes street/ 
liave enlisted, it has been decided by 
.the executive committee to suspend 
Tthe operations of their house. The 
¦club organization, however, will re­
main intact, and all club matters will 
be attended to by the chairman of the 
Alumni Association, Mr. Ed. W. 
Crump, Jr.
As soon as normal times are re­
stored, the club will again assume the 
operations of their house.
TAU DETA PI INITIATES 
NEW THEN AT BANQUET
Three Honorary MembersTa- 
ken in Along With Grad­
uates and Undergradutes
Saturday evening, April 2S, the Car­
negie Tech Chapter of Tau Beta Pi 
held an initiation banquet at the Fort 
Pitt Hotel. It was a memorable oc­
casion on account of both the number 
and the character of the men initiated 
and the number of old Tau Beti Pi 
men that were there to witness it.
Three honorary members were first 
initiated: A. A. Hamerschlag, Direc­
tor of the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology; Fred Crabtree, head of the De­
partment of Metallurgy and Mining; 
W. C. L. Trinks, head of the Depart­
ment of Mechanical Engineering.
Ten graduates were next initiated: 
R. S. Dornberger, A. J. Peterson and 
H. G. Texter, of the 1913 class; W. J. 
Corbett, E. W. Gaylord, C. R. Holy- 
worth and W. Miller, of the 1914 class, 
and H. Levy, W. N. Flanagan, and H. 
S. Stockdale, of the 1915 class. Five 
undergraduates completed the roll of 
initiates. These were C. A. Andrews, 
W. F. Eames, E. F. Lundeen, H. L. 
Parker, and R. T. Soule, all 1918 men.
After the initiation sixty members 
sat down to a most entertaining ban­
quet. W. L. Affelder, an old Penn 
State man, was toastmaster, and ably 
introduced the speakers. S. B. Flagg, 
former president of the Pittsburgh 
Alumni Association of Tau Beta Pi, 
spoke on "Stones,” the building ma­
terial of which good and successful 
men are made. Darwin A. Curtis 
spoke of what the young Tech Chap­
ter had done and urged all Tau Beta 
Pi men of Pittsburgh to co-operate 
with the school chapter. The presi­
dent of the chapter, T. E.- Orr, then 
gave the address of welcome. The

STUDENTS WORK ON 
MILITARY POSTERS
During the past .few weeks the stu­
dents of the Illustration Course have 
been busily working on war posters. 
The Conference Committee on Nation­
al Preparedness in New York is offer­
ing $500 in prizes, $250 for the best 
navy poster, and $250 for the best 
army poster. And here in Pittsburgh 
Lyman S. Alger is offering three prizes 
of $100, $50 and $25 for the best army 
poster to aid recruiting.
Incidentally the committee on mil­
itary affairs of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology has requested the stu­
dents to design a flag for the Tech 
regiment. The field must be in in­
fantry blue and the design should con­
tain the name of the regiment.
PLAID ATHLETES POUND W. AND J. MOHAN FOR EASY VICTORY
Tech Men Touch McCreight 
Freely For Long Hits
WITHERS FEATURES AT BAT
Just to show that their reputation 
as sluggers was well earned, Captain 
Zehfuss and his men packed their 
warclubs to the game last Thursday 
and drove Scrubby McCreight’s offer­
ings to all corners of the lot. When 
they left off fattening their batting 
averages, the score stood 11 to 7 in 
their favor, but Scrubby was still on 
the mound. Perhaps W. & J. brought 
•only one pitcher with them. All told, 
the Carnegie Tech athletes gathered 
twelve safe drives off his slants, only 
two of which were wasted.
Shortstop Jim Doherty was the bat­
ting star of the day, with four singles 
and three runs in four trips to the 
plate, while Withers garnered a triple, 
a double, a single, drove in four runs 
and scored two himself in three times 
at bat. He had but one putout at first, 
a rather unique feature. The Pirates 
might well look him over.
Tech started her scoring in the sec­
ond inning. Doherty singled to left 
and Withers drove him in with a triple 
to right. Kesner flied to middle, 
Withers coming in after the catch by 
Myers.
In the third they added three more. 
Miller’s grounder went through both 
McCreight and Gray. Yeager singled 
to center, Shorty taking second. Do­
herty advanced both with a base hit

W PLANS 
DROPPED FOR THE YEAR
National Crisis Would Make 
Such an Affair Incongruous
Feeling that the present national 
crisis demands every possible atten­
tion and effort from the students of 
Carnegie Tech, the committee In 
charge of the May Festival, which was 
outlined in an earlier Issue of The 
Tartan, have decided to drop the mat­
ter for this year. It will be remem­
bered that a trip with all expenses 
paid was offered for a Cornell football 
game to the man who, In the estima­
tion of a committee consisting of Mr. 
J. R. Gearhart, Dr. Esquerre, and Mr. 
H. J. McCorkle, should send in the 
best suggestion of improving .the 
school. M. B. Garber, a Design 
Junior, was given the decision for a 
suggestion of advertising Carnegie 
Tech by getting here seniors from all 
the high schools within a day’s travel 
to look us over, presumably at work.
The Tartan had decided to push the 
matter, and, indeed, invitations and 
publicity had been arranged for just 
before the break with Germany oc­
curred. This trouble halted the plans, 
and at a recent meeting of the men 
above mentioned it was concluded 
that a Spring Festival, with athletics, 
supper in the Beanery, and a dance 
would not give the visitors the Idea 
that Tech is behind the Government, 
with her heart in the work.
it was originally planned to, make 
this an annual event, and there is 
generally no reason for not making It 
so. Those who were Interested are 
hoping that the matter will not be 
buried long, but that it will be merely 
placed in cold storage until other 
more important affairs have been 
cleared up.
PITT-TELD TRACK MEN 
TO MEET ON LOCAL FIELD
Pitt and Tech will meet day after 
tomorrow on Tech's now track, for 
their annual meet. Both teams will 
enter the meet with a handicap, 
Pitt having lost two or three of 
her best men and Tech having lost 
Dunseith and Hemman this year, 
since the season began, besides 
Reiser, Walker and Moore, who did 
not come back this year. It will 
be a surprise to many to know that 
Dunseith will not represent Tech 
after his work In the Penn Relay 
at Philadelphia Aveek before last, but 
"Dunnle” left school soon aftor re­
turning from Philadelphia to help 
Uncle Sam make ammunition. Hom- 
inan has been on the slclc list and 
unable to take part in the events 
this season.
This will be the first occasion for 
Tech to see her own track men do 
their best on the home track this 
year and after the record made at 
Philadelphia—only being beaten by 
Colgate, in our class—and other 
records made around school this 
year, such as Ellerton breaking all 
previous school records in shot In 
the inter-school meet a week ago 
last Friday one can be sure ho Is 
going to see some mighty hot 
finishes next Saturday on Tech’s 
field, starting at 2:15.
In order to obtain definite informa­
tion from the United States Civil Serv­
ice Commission regarding the neces­
sity for skilled or semi-skilled me­
chanics in the Government works, a j 
letter was written to Mr. J. H. Mc- 
Ilhenny, president of the commission, 
Washington, D. C., and his reply is as 
follows :
“Mr. H. J. McCorkle,
"Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
"Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, Pa. 
"Sir:
“The Commission is in receipt of 
your letter of April 19, making several 
inquiries as to the advisability underi 
the present emergency of young men 
who are being trained in your insti­
tute along different lines leaving their 
courses and entering Government es­
tablishments in the lines of work in 
which they are trained.
“In reply to your queries the follow­
ing is submitted:
“1. The Commission, so far, has 
been able to meet the urgent needs of 
the Government for machinists, pat- 
tern-makers, foundrymen, and most 
other mechanical positions.
"2. Appointments are made for a 
probationary period of six months, 
upon the completion of which the ap­
pointment is made permanent. Eight

INDUSTRIES SENIORS 
BANQUET AT LAUREL
The members of the Senior Class of 
the Industries School held a dinner 
last Thursday evening at "The 
Laurel.” A pleasing menu was served, 
after which President I-Ioxworth acted 
as toastmaster and called on each man 
present for a short talk. Plans for the 
future were discussed and it is prob­
able that another such event will be 
held before graduation.
Word has been received of the en­
gagement of D. D. Micheli, Class of '13, 
and Miss Beatrice Congdon, of Staf­
ford Springs, Conn.
J. L. Elliott, Class of '10, and Miss

GIRLS SCHOOL TO HAVE 
PLEBE REGULATIONS
First Year Girls Are to Take 
Part in Qualification Day
At the last M. M. C. S. assembly 
It was decided to join the boys on 
Qualification Day. In order to do 
this it Is necessary to have some 
regulations to discard; thoreforo, the 
following rules for Plebes which had 
boon previously drawn up wore ac­
cepted :
Plebes must wear a sloevoband of 
yellow and plaid while on the camp­
us and in the building.
Plebes are not permitted to walk 
or convorse with men whllo on the 
campus.
Plebos are permitted to wonr only 
the following pieces of jowelry— 
one necossary pin and a. watch.
The following courtosles are re­
quired of all Plobes:
(a) Holding opon doors for fac­
ulty and uppor classmen.
(b) Giving precedence to faculty 
and upper classmen In the building, 
on the campus and in the stroot 
cars.
Penalties for breaking these rulos 
to bo deckled upon by the Gonornl 
student Council.
It was also decided that each 
Plebo should hake a coke to be glvon 
by the Senior girls to the Senior 
men on Qualification Day who will 
in this way judge which Plobo will 
make the host Sophomore. The 
rules which will bo enforced for

All companies were told to state 
their needs in uniforms Thursday and 
measurements will be taken the com­
ing week. Every student will receive 
a uniform, and 11’ unable to pay for it 
will use it as school property, and pay 
a small deposit for Its use during the 
drills.
Friday morning was rainy, hence the 
indoor meetings were held in assembly 
rooms. In Room 209 Science, Captain 
Christie, of the Pittsburgh Military As­
sociation, outlined the work and pur­
pose of that unit. He spoke in detail 
of requirements for army officers and 
cautioned the students against feeling 
too well informed on military affairs. 
There is no place in the Army for 
“know-it-alls,” but consistent applica­
tion and obedience are requisites to 
good soldiery. This is emphasized in 
drill here, absolute obedience being 
required.
Drill Manuals, which every student 
electing drill should have, are obtain­
able for thirty cents at the store room.
The night students were obliged to 
omit their first drill, Friday night, be­
cause of rain.
TO SERVE: COUNTRY
George Finlay, our star football 
player; T. C. Perkinson, T. Clark and 
F. Young, Science students, received 
notice to report to their naval olllcer 
in Philadelphia. These men enlisted 
in Unit 13, ol’ the Naval Reserve. 
Twelve Industry students have gone 
to Waterbury, Conn., for employment 
In the U. S. Arsenal.
Conscription may deplete the stu­
dent body considerably before noxt 
Fall. However, it’ a meeting of 
college presidents In Philadelphia last 
Saturday accomplishes Its purpose, 
college students may not be con­
scripted on the same basis of other 
civilians.
INDUSTRIES MEN WORK 
IN WATERTOWN ARSENAL
Last Thursday ovonlng, 12 Indus­
tries men, 3 uppor and 9 middle

Prior to their departure, In the aft­
ernoon they ’ assembled In Room 104, 
where Doan Connolly, Prof. Leeds 
and Mr. McCorklo each gavo a short 
talk. Representatives from the stu­
dent body were also present. Each 
of the men was given a letter from 
the student assembly of Ilio Indus­
tries School, commending him for 
the fact that ho was leaving to "do 
his bit.” Later they wore glvon a 
rousing sendoff. Tho group con­

resented Among Speakers|
BEGINS AT TWO O’CLOCK
A. M. STAEHLEP. W. EMMEL
Mr. Arthur W. Tarbell was elected 
president of the American Associa­
tion of Collegiate Registrars, which 
held its eighth annual meeting at 
the University of Kentucky, April 
26 to 27.
That the Colleges and Universities 
of the country are giving liberal 
consideration to students who re­
sign to enter national service was 
shown in reports. The association 
endorsed as "patriotic and expedient 
the principle of allowing scholastic 
credit to Btudents who cease their 
college work for service In military 
or allied activities and favored ac­
ceptance into college next fall, or1 
later, of new students whose en­
trance credits may be somewhat 
short because of similar curtailment, 
of their secondary school courses 
this spring.
The association endorsed an offer 
of the executive committee to tho 
War Department to endeavor to ob­
tain the co-operation of governing 
boards of their institutions in using 
registrars’ offices os recruiting stfl/- 
tlons, if the need arises. (
In addition to considering the war 
situation and the problem of next, 
year’s enrollment, the registrars dis­
cussed grading, matters relating to 
admission, attendance and absences, 
fees, registration, reports on stand­
ing and other subjects. The! speak-

the Plebes look anxiously forward dur­
ing the entire year, is Friday, May 11. 
On this day the Plebes will be re 
ceived by the upper classmen as Tech- ' 
ites and the 1920 Tribe will be taken 
into the Tech Clan.
All day Friday the coffin will lie in 
state in the foyer of the Design 
School. The services will begin at 2 
o’clock. The procession will form in

band, playing the funeral dirge, will 
lead, followed by the robed pallbearers 
carrying the ebfiin, and the Design 
Plebes.
After marching around the campus 
the procession will wend its course to 
the athletic field, where the coffin will 
be set at rest. As the Plebes march 
past It, they will drop into it their 
regulation apparel. The coffin then 
will bo carried to the funeral bier and 
while it is burning the remainder of 
tho program will be carried out.

THE RETIRING STAFF
Thjs issue oil the Tartan marks the initial effort of the new 
staff. The retiring members have during the past year made won­
derful progress'. From the little magazine-like affair of last year, 
the Tartan lias developed under Staehle and Emmel into a real 
newspaper, requiring considerable skill both in reporting and 
make-up. Probably the most noticeable improvement has been 
made in the latter, for in addition to the change in size of the 
paper tliere has been a great advance in the’ use of head-line 
technic and in the matter of cuts. Probably there are very few 
students who realize now how great an advantage there is in hav­
ing the main facts of the news set before them- in accurate head­
lines, but if we were to return to the rather haphazard system of 
former years the effect would be immediately apparent. In cuts 
also the Tartan is far in advance of the other college papers of the 
country; there lias not been a single issue published this year with­
out a picture of some sort.
AVliile this improvemet in make-up is important, that in policy 
is even more so. The Tartan began the year with an editorial ap- 
pcal for a better system of elections; after considerable personal 
work on the purl; of the Editor-in-Chicf, the Tartan system of elec­
tions was adopted in the three men’s schools, and has been observed 
in fairly good faith. The athletic department covered the foot­
ball games with a thoroughness and interest that has been lacking 
for several years; and editorially the paper was responsible • for 
some improvement in the condition of the athletic field. The Tar­
tan did its best to support the important events of the year—the 
»Slavonic Ball, the Junior Prom, the installation of the All Schools 
Constitution, the Home Concort; and was undoubtedly at least a 
factor in the success of those affairs. Finally the Tartan gavo ex­
pression to the student feeling for proparodnoss; and through a 
committee of the staff, gave to the school the information which 
finally resulted in a concerted student appeal for military training. 
Carnegie Teeh is probably I lie only school in the country where 
such an appeal originated with the students themselves,
The business side of the paper has naturally progressed pro­
portionately. Th the Thistle has announced, the circulation was 
greatly increased, and reached its culmination in the issue roportin 
the Pitt game. The retiring staff has increased the popularity of 
ihe, paper with the .alumni, and incidentally the members of the 
Varsity Clan will all'receive’ it as part of tie Clan’s activity.
We of the new staff feel strongly in this matter. There is no 
doubt that the Tartan has developed, that it is one of the few 
school activities which has developed in proportion to the football 
team; and there is equally no doubt, but that this advance has been 
due largely to the leadership of Staehle and Emmel. AVe only hope 
that a. resume of our work a year from now may be as striking as 
i his is.
MARGERET MORRISON TARTAN STAFF
The installation of a new Tartan staff marks a decided change 
in the Margare^ Morrison portion of the staff. Previously there 
as been only one representative from the girls’ school, and she 
as always been selected through the votes of her classmates, 
bviously such a system has been inefficient, if for no other reason 
than that there has been too much work for one girl'to do. In 
the future the Tartan reporters in the Margaret Morrison School 
will be the members of the English Minor Course, instituted this 
year by Miss Parry.
English Minor is a new course at Margaret Morrison0. It is a 
combination of Secretarial Studies and English, newspaper and 
magazine writing being emphasized. The girls in the course have 
been selected by the teachers of English on account oNf the good 
work which they did in IMebe Themes. At the completion of the 
course the girls will have an opportunity to go into publication 
houses as assistants, to write for magazines, or to become private 
secretaries for people doing literary work.

CIVILS HOLD BANQUET 
AT UNIVERSITY CLUB
Did some one say that the great 
ileed of the engineer is training, in the 
correct use of English? The author 
of that statement would have been 
'Orced to admit that this need has 
'en fulfilled at Carnegie Tech, had 
f attended the banquet of the Civils 
f. University Club on May 2. Dr. 
V ,id Prof. Thayer showed them-
soivt's as skilled in debate as Mr. Sim­
mons and Prof. McCullough in regular 
oratory. Tom Orr and L. 11. Rowe, of 
the Seniors, demonstrated that the art 
Is not entirely confined to the l'.ieulty.
The only thing to bo regretted was 
the absence of "Captain Charlie’ 
Stanton. His military duties over 
powered his desire to feast with his 
many friends, but his spirit seemed 
to pervade the place throughout the 
evening.
The suggestions by Prof. McCul­
lough in egard to furthering the inter 
ests of the C. E. Society and of the
C. E. students in general were re­
ceived with unanimous approval by 
the members presént. This'waà sim­
ply another indication of the bigness 
of the man who is now at the head of 
ihis department.
OPHELEUM FRATERNITY 
ENTERTAINS ALPHA TAU
In accordance with the plan of the 
Industries honorary society to hold 
their meetings at the different frater­
nity houses available, the Opheleum 
Fraternity opened their house to 
Alpha Tail on Monday night for the 
first meeting under this arrangement, 
it, was the first definite step toward 
inter-fraternity association and marks 
a step that can result in nothing but 
a general benefit to all.
Harry S. Vandervort, of Opheleum, 
has been accepted in the Engineers 
Corps as corporal, and is now subject 
to call by the Government. Louis 
Lange has been staying at the Ophe­
leum House completing his arrange­
ments in enlisting in the Regular 
Army. Lange attended Tech two years 
ago.
TECH STUDENTS RENDER 
VALUABLE ASSISTANCE
The following letter, which was 
received by our director, speaks 
well of the work Tech students can 
do:
A. A. Hammersclilag,
Director Carnefie Institute of 
Technology,
Pittsburgh, Penna.
Dear Sir:
In the recent count made of the 
flow of travel of the Pittsburgh 
Railways Company, we had in our 
employ a number of the students of 
your institution. They rendered val­
uable assistance, and at a time 
when it would have been very em­
barrassing to have gone into the 
open market and obtained men who 
would have done anything like as 
well as these young men.
I wish to acknowledge through 
you the great assistance that they 
have rendered in this “survey” to 
the City of Pittsburgh. The "pep” 
that they threw into the work is 
what I had a right, from past exper­
ience, to expect and which I got.
Sincerely yours,
E. IC. MORSE, 
Transit Commissioner.
OPHELEUM FRATERNITY 
HOLDS PATRIOTIC DANCE
The Opheleum Fraternity held a 
patriotic dance at tlieir home on 
Howe street, last Friday night. The 
house was decorated in the national 
colors, with the programs and small 
silk (lags to carry out the effect. This 
is the last of a series of house dances 
which, the fraternity has successfully 
carried out during the winter season, 
and was voted the best of all. It is 
hoped that the majority of the mem­
bers will be able to return next fall, 
when they again may resume these

INDOOR TRACK MEET
At an indoor team meet held in 
the gymnasium of the M. M. C. S. 
Saturday morning, May 5 th, the 
sophomores were victorious with a 
score of 164 points against a plebe 
score of 141 points. The events of 
competition were the high jump, 
box vault, rope vault, a volley ball 
game, and a relay race. Miss Ruth 
Ross received the highest number of 
points of the Plebes, and Miss Ma­
rion Gifford of the Sophomores. The 
girls in the Playground Theory Class 
acted as officials under the direction 
of Miss Caverly and Miss Browning. 
Miss Hilda P. Cooper was clerk of 
course, Miss Grace Johnston, head 
score keeper, Misses Betty Mason 
and Lucy Sternalt assistant score 
keepers, Miss Rachel Beatty judge, 
and Miss Grace Johnston starter.

FOURTH IN SERIES 
OF MILITARY LESSONS
The course in Administration con­
sists of those portions of the United 
, States Army Regulations which are 
! necessary in the every day duties 
of officers, and a knowledge of 
which is required to pass an army 
examination. Before taking up the 
study of the subject, the work of the 
student will be facilitated by under­
standing in some measure something 
of the origin and authroity of Army 
Regulations. In Winthrop’s -Abridge- 
Iment of Military Law, p. 8, they are 
defined as follows:
“Regulations are administrative 
rules or directions as distinguished 
from enactments. They exist in all 
the Executive Departments and are 
of very material service in the effi­
cient. administration of the Govern­
ment. Army Regulations are au­
thoritative directions as in the de­
tails of military duty and discipline. 
The authority for Army Regulations 
is to be found in the distinctive 
functions of the President as Com­
mander in Chief and Executive 
His function as Commander in Chief 
authorizes him to issue, personally 
or through his military subordinates, 
such orders and direction^' as are 
necessary and proper to insure order 
and discipline in the Army. His 
function as Executive empowers him, 
personally or through the Secretary 
of War, to prescribe rules, where 
requisite, for the due execution of 
the statutes relating to the military 
establishment.”
The- Continental Congress, prior 
to the adoption of the Constitution 
of the United States, provided, at 
various times, . regulations for the 
Army, principally rules for the gov­
ernment of Staff corps. Sometimes, 
the War Board, consisting of civil­
ians, made regulations for their 
employes. As soon as Congress ap­
pointed a Secretary of War. he was 
required to make regulations on 
many subjects. In 1779 Congress 
adopted “Regulations to be observed 
by all the troops of the United 
States.” These were prepared by 
Baron Steuben, and consisted mainly 
of tactics taken from the' Prussian 
system but containing various “in­
structions.” An edition of “Regula­
tions” was published by M. Carey, 
in 1809, in Philadelphia. President 
Adams, in 1798, issued a set of 
manuscript regulations, supplemental 
to those of Baron Steuben, pre­
scribing many duties of different 
grades of officers and men, particu­
larly with respect, to barracks ad­
ministration. In 1808, Dinsmore and 
Cooper, by authority of the govern­
ment, published in Washington, a 
little book containing the Articles of 
War and certain regulations relating 
to promotion and allowances. Dur­
ing this time, however, there was no 
coherent or consistent system of 
regulations in existence for the mili­
tary establishment of the United 
States. In 1812 a. book was pub­
lished giving certain statutes and 
existing regulations relating to allow­
ances, promotion, and the duties of 
the staff.
In 1813 was published the first of 
our series of codes of Army Regula­
tions, but the greater part of the 
book was taken 'up with statutes 
and contained but few pages of regu­
lations proper. Editions of the Army 
Regulations were published in 1814, 
181(5, 181.7 and 1S20, recording the 
changes made from year to year. An 
edition was published in 1821, and 
in 1825 General Scott revised it. A 
system of regulations was published 
in 1834, by Francis P. Blair, but it 
was not an authorized one. In 1833, 
a number of important regulations 
were published in “Orders No. 48,” 
which were known in the Army as 
the “48th Commandment." These 
established our present system of 
accountableness and responsibility. 
Froln that time the War Department 
held a new rank in the Cabinet. An 
authorized edition of regula­
tions, known as the Macomb 
Edition, next appeared, be­
ing printed in 1835. Some amend­
ments were made to this in 1836. 
The next edition was issued in 1841 
and was revised by General Town­
send in 1S47. The next edition was 
published in 1S57 and was known 
as the “Jeff Davis’ Regulations.” 
Mr. Davis being Secretary of War at 
the time. The regulations of 1S61 
were a repetition of the Regulations 
of 1S57, and some additions were 
made to it in 1S63, by Secretary of 
War Stanton. In 1S67 a new code 
was prepared by General Townsend, 
and was submitted to a board con­
sisting of (ienerals Sherman, Sheri­
dan and Augur. These regulations 
were approved by General Grant in 
1S6S. In 1S70 Congress prescribed 
that the Secretary of War prepare 
Army Regulations, and a board of 
officers headed by Colonel Marcy 
convened in 1871, completing its 
labors in 1873, and the regulations 
were adopted in 1875. An unauthor­
ized code Avas printed in 1S76, but 
was never published to the Army. 
In 1876, General Schofield was as>- 
slgned to prepare a revised edition 
based on the editions of 1S6S and 
1875, but the system proposed by 
him was not printed. There were 
several resolutions introduced in 
Congress in the next few years 
following, but it. appears that, there 
was no real revision of resolutions, 
until, in 1S79, Congress placed the 
entire subject in the hands of the 
Secretary of War, and authorized 
him to codify all the regulations and 
I General Orders. The regulations 
! of 1SS1 were the outcome of this 
step. There were no new editions 
of the Regulations until 1SS9. which 
were objected to on the ground that 
they were imperfect and hastily

published, and the Regulations of 
1895 were next issued.
Since 1895 there have been several 
editions due to the changes made 
from year to year, until at the pres­
ent writing (1916) the last edition 
is that issued in 1913. As there 
have been so many changes made in 
this edition, and as the Articles of 
War have been revised, a new edi­
tion may soon be expected. Pend­
ing its publication, however, stu­
dents will use the edition of 1913, 
with changes. These changes are 
printed in the form of Orders from 
the War Department, and are en­
closed in a manila envelope. The 
student should enter the changes 
opposite each paragraph affected. 
For example, “Changes No. 12” 
changed a large number of para­
graphs such as Nos. 66, 128, 239, 
etc. Turn to Paragraph 66 on Page 
20 of the Army Regulations, and 
write opposite the paragraph “C. A. 
R. 12.” When you have occasion to 
refer to this paragraph, you will 
know at once that a change has 
been made, and you can then look in 
your envelope at Changes No. 12 
and see what the change is. You 
should keep your Army Regulations 
constantly corrected and brought up 
to date, and should annotate every 
paragraph that is changed. This will 
require a little time and patience, 
but if you post up a few every day 
you will have no trouble in soon hav­
ing a completely corrected book.

WILL PRODUCE PLAYS
“Richard II” was given on Monday 
and Tuesday evenings of this week, 
and will be played again this even­
ing. “The Weevils,” by Sara Ben­
nett and Howard Smith, will be 
played on Thursday evening and 
probably again on Friday evening.
The night drama students will give 
a performance of Bjornson’s “The 
Newly Married Couple,” some night 
next week.
Stephen Phillip’s “Paola and Fran­

ONLY GOVERNMENT WORK 
OBTAINED FOR SENIORS
Believing that every member of 
the graduating classes should engage 
his services in some department of 
government work in the existing 
emergency, the Bureau of Recom­
mendations will discontinue its ac­
tive efforts to place the graduates 
in civil employment (except those 
men who would not qualify for gov- 
vernment service because of physical 
disabilities and will place at Jhe 
disposal of the seniors, informa­
tion regarding the U. S. military 
service, U. S. Civil Service examina­
tions and employment, with indus­
trial firms directly engaged in the 
production of government supplies or 
necessities. . Every senior should 
consider carefully his own training 
and experience and determine for 
himself the branch of government 
service in which his abilities would 
be of greatest value in the support 
of the nation’s war program.

(Continued From Last Week.)
Again to conclude this section on 
education, I wish to quote Prof. Hux­
ley’s definition of a liberal education 
in its entirety. He wrote:
“That man, I think, has had a lib­
eral education, who has been so train­
ed in youth that his body is tlie ready 
servant of his will and does with 
ease and pleasure all the work that, 
as a mechanism, it is capable of; 
.whose intellect is a clear, cold, logic 
engine, with all its parts of equal 
strength and in smooth working or­
der, ready, like a steam engine, to be 
turned to any kind of work, and spin 
the gossamers as well as forge the 
anchors of the mind, whose mind i> 
stored with a knowledge of the gr«*a« 
and fundamental truths of no+'iic and 
of the laws of her operation; one who, 
no stunted ascetic, is full of life and 
fire, but whose passions are trained 
to come to heel by a vigorous will, 
the servants of a tender conscience, 
who has learned to love all beauty, 
whether of nature or of art, to hate 
all vileness, and to respect others as 
himself.
“Such a one and no other, I con­
ceive, has had a liberal education; for 
he is, as completely as man can be, 
in harmony with nature. He will 
make the best of her, and she of him. 
They will get on together rarely; she 
as his ever beneficent mother; he as 
her mouthpiece, her conscious self, her 
minister and iterpreter.”
Probably the most serious charge laid 
at the feet of the engineer is his lack 
of interest and .nonparticipation in 
public affairs. This is indeed a most 
grave accusation. Is it not the engi­
neer’s duty to himself and to the com­
munity to take a vital and active part 
in the administration of such affairs 
as affect the common good?
Society owes much to the engineer. 
In England only two hundred and fifty 
years ago, according to Macaulay, 
there were no sidewalks, the streets 
were unlighted, the highways became 
bogs in rainy weather, and highway 
robbery was almost a recognized pro­
fession; sanitation and sewerage were 
unknown, and refuse heaps accumu­
lated under the windows of the great 
and wealthy; and it was still legal 
to hang the unfortunate who sole a 
loaf of bread.
Contrast these with present condi­
tions. Today some countries support 
a population of five hundred peopie to 
the square mile, while .it requires
fifty tliosand acres to support one sav­
age. It is the engineer who has made 
this possible. He has built railways, 
which have annihilated distance and 
presumably made all men neighbors, 
so that it was thought war would soon 
be a rarity, but unfortunately primi­
tive passion still exists. He has
thrown great bridges across yawning 
chasms which seemingly formed im­
passable obstacles to further progress. 
He has designed and built skeletons 
of steel to dizzy heights. He has
burrowed through great mountains, 
paved streets, brought pure water into 
houses,, and removed the waste mat­
ters so that health might be preserved. 
He has drained swamps and irrigated 
dry hills arid,plains. 1-Ie has made it 
possible to carry workmen back and 
forth to work in rapid transit cars. 
He has built practically all of our pub­
lic works. This is indeed a record to 
be proud of.
But should the engineer rest con­
tent simply with doing the work which 
makes for our comfort and happiness, 
at the command of lawyers and busi­
ness men? The engineers complain 
that, the profession does not receive 
due praise and credit for Sts splendid 
work. This is probably true enough 
but is the reason not very largely be­
cause the engineer has been content to 
do the Work and then fade into the 
background, leaving the talking and 
the managing to the lawyer and poli­
tician?
It is a notorious fact that enormous 
amounts of money have been squan­
dered on public works because they 
were undertaken in “a" way which 
every engineer knew must be ineffi­
cient , and uneconomical. Again, many 
questions prominently before public 
and legislative bodies are peculiarly 
such as require engineering knowl­
edge for their proper understanding 
and regulation.
It has once been wittily remarked 
that in looking at Congress ' one was 
merely seeing as if reflected in a 
mirror the great people who elected 
it, and' that if we, the people, did 
not like the looks of ourselves, ’we 
should not’ get angry and break the 
mirror but go and wash our faces. 
Let us then take a look at this re­
flection of the people.

And this is the personnel of the 
congress that passes ’Tipon such ques­
tions as water power apd conserva­
tion. Is this body representative of 
the American people? Are there not 
a disproportionate number of mem­
bers of the legal profession in out- 
legislative bodies? A proper engi­
neering education and training gen­
erally develops a. man’s power of ob­
servation and his desire to ascertain 
the truth. He becomes skeptical of 
mere theories, doubts tradition, and 
spurns superstition, but he constant­
ly searches for the truth and is not 
afraid of facts. In other words the 
engineer is always “from Missouri.” 
Is not this the spirit which is need­
ed in respect to other problems in 
the social, industrial, and political 
world? The engineer's reputation for 
honesty is almost proverbial. His 
training should also produce in him 
a fine blend of conservation and rad­
icalism. He does not adopt an idea 
merely because of its novelty, but de­
mands before adoption the acid test, 
that it should be really better than 
the old. The country, therefore, has 
a right to look to the engineers as 
well as to the others for leadership 
in the affairs of government, and not 
until the engineer of all grades has 
done his part towards promoting 
everything that is for the welfare of 
this nation can he truly say that lie 
is in the fullest sense of the term a 
good citizen of the American repub­
lic.
On the other hand, Prof. Swain 
thinks that the engineer’s training 
does not fit him to be a power in the 
community, nor does it give him the 
preeminent qualities necessary for 
leadership. It is his contention that 
under the present educational sys­
tem, the legal training and experi­
ence on the whole probably fits men 
better to think straight, to reason 
logically, and to have greater breadth 
of view than an engineering training.
Engineers have been accused of 
being too utilitarian, of having no 
artistic sense. The stream of scien­
tific and industrial development 
which engineers have done so much 
to .strengthen and direct is said to 
have washed away the old land­
marks of idealism and and art. To 
quote ,C. D. Marx, Past President of 
the American Society of Civil Engi­
neers, on this subject:
“Engineers are called iconoclasts, 
utilitarians, non-respectors of tradi­
tion, antiquity, and picturesqueness. 
Yes, engineers are iconoclasts, re­
formers usually are. Utilitarians, 
that also is an accusation that engi­
neers cannot deny, but is an act less 
noble for being useful? Non-respec­
tors of tradition and antiquity! Again 
the the engineers are forced to pleat! 
guilty, if tradition stands for error, 
and antiquity for decay. What is 
picturesqueness but the diseased con­
dition of structures and their sur­
roundings? What is this vaunted love 
of the picturesque in many cases, 
but a selfish and thoughtless appre­
ciation of surface appearances? Sel-, 
fish and thoughtless, I say, because 
the few are willing to sacrifice the 
weal and woe, the health and happi­
ness of the many, in order that they 
may feast their eyes on narrow wind­
ing streets, on quaint gables, far 
reaching eaves, and small curiously 
leaded panes of glass.
"Perhaps it is now granted that 
engineering and idealism are not in­
compatible.”
In conclusion, then it/might be said 
that engineering is a profession of 
service, from which too much must 
not be expected in return, except 
that of having given ungrudingly and 
one’s 'best. It seems to be generally 
agreed that nothing is further from 
fact than the common delusion that 
-the engineering professions are es­
pecially promising and lucrative. In 
the ordinary course of events there 
are no large prizes to be drawn from 
the engineering fields and investiga­
tion shows that large salaries rarely 
fall to the lot of the engineer. The 
fact mast be faced that the profes­
sion is overcrowded at the present 
time, and probably will continue to 
be overcrowded for some time to 
come. By the laws of economics 
this means that the supply of engi­
neers is in excess of the demand and 
that by the process of competition, 
wages, salaries and fees inevitably 
tend toward a minimum below which 
the supply is reduced by men taking 
up some other line of work.
This is a rather pessimistic view 
of the subject, but in the face of 
the conditions, it must be aired. 
Ernest McCullough once said, “There 
is more to life tran money. Engi­
neering especially is no occupation 
for the man whose sole motive in 
^electing it is the belief that pay is 
always high, advancement certain, 
and great wealth the sure end.”
Man is but the pawn of Fate 
Life is like a swiftly flowing stream, 
carrying upon Its surface many float­
ing objects. Some keep near the 
center and move on serenely with no 
disturbance of any sort, clear to the 
ocean in which the river ends. Oth­
ers float near thé edge, unable tc 
get near the middle, and these occa­
sionally stand, lying on the sand bars 
until a rise in the stream carries 
them to another shallow where they
again rest. Still others are caught 
in some eddy and float round and 
round in restless circles until they 
become waterlogged and sink.
But of all the works of man, none 
are so wonderful, so majestic, so awe 
inspiring, as the work of the engi­
neer. The epic of the engineer is 
written in railways, canals and 
bridges, roads and parks, and finally 
in the great ultimate struggles ’ of 
mankind on the battlefield to save 
and destroy nations. To the truly 
successful engineer no greater tribute 
can be paid than the following, from 
the poem by Edward Everett Hale, 
entitled “Unnamed Saints:”
What was his name? I do not know 
his name.
I oiily know he heard God’s voice 
and came;
Brought all he loved across the sea, 
To live and work for God and me, 
Felled the ungracious oak,
With horrid toil 
Dragged from the soil 
The thrice-gnarled roots and stub­
born rock;
With plenty filled the haggard moun­
tain-side,
And, when his work was done, with­
out memorial died.
No blaring trumpet sounded out his 
fame;
He lived, he died. I do not know 
his name.
No form of bronze and no memorial 
stones
Show me the place where lie his 
moldering bones.
Only a cheerful city stands, 
Builded by his hardened hands; 
Only ten thousand homes,
Where every day,
The cheerful play 
Of love and hope and courage comes: 
These are his monuments, and these 
alone—
There is no form of bronze and no 
memorial stone.
DELTA EPSILON OMEGA 
HOLDS HOUSE DANCE
The members of the Delta Epsilon 
Omega Fraternity,,their ladies and in­
vited guests enjoyed a' most pleasant 
house dance, last Saturday evening, 
The affair was in keeping with patri 
otism and the interior of the house 
was prettily decorated with large and 
small American flags and festoons. 
The music was furnished by Bowen’s 
Orchestra. At a late hour, dainty re­
freshments were served, after which 
the dancing continued until midnight, 
the chaperones were Mr. and Mrs. I-T. 
L. Gage and Mr. and Mrs. I-I. F. Reed,
DOHERTY TOPS LIST 
OF TECH'S OATTEOS
With the Washington & Jefferson 
game tucked away, some of the Plaid 
ball tossers gave their batting aver­
age a good boost upwards. This is 
especally true of Doherty, who got 
four hits out of as many times at the 
plate.
Yeager, registered two hits out of 
four times at bat and as a result runfc 
“Doc” a close race for,honors,
The remainder of the team although 
waving the stick with much emphasis, 
have as a rule, failed to place the ball 
where the fielders "ain’t.”
Before the season ends the players 
aver, however, that every average on 
the team shall be over the .300 mark'. 
Here’s hoping.
Individual batting averages of the 
Plaid team—Doherty .334, Yeager 
.320, Lyons .250, Withers .222, Gano 
.174, Hir'd .1GG, Osborne .125, Zehfuss 
.120, Miller .111, Cosgrove .043, Kesner

INTEREST ñ TENNIS 
GROWING IN M. M. C. S.
More than thirty girls have signed 
up for the tennis tournament to be 
held by the M. M. C. S. Athletic 
Association. The . only requirement 
has been membership in the asso­
ciation and players, good, bad and 
indifferent have been encouraged to 
enter, resulting in a great number 
of entries and a more general inter­
est in the whole affair.
A new scheme is being tried in 
playing off the matches. . Formerly 
the entries were matched indiscrim­
inately but according to the new 
plans, members of . each class will 
play for class championship, the four 
winners of which will match for 
school championship.
Those entering will receive a num­
ber of points, those winning the 
class championship an increased 
number and the person winning the 
school championship the largest 
number of points toward winning 
the sweater awarded by the associa­
tion to those gaining a hundred 
points In athletic activities.

BENEFIT DANCE TO BE 
GIVEN BY RENDTS CLUB
The Renots Club of the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School on Friday 
evening, May 11, 1917, will hold a 
dance for the benefit of the Milk and 
lee Fund, in the Carnegie Union. This 
is a worthy cause to which the Renots 
Club has contributed annually by hold­
ing an affair to aid this good work, 
and every one can assist the cause by 
attending this benefit dance. Come, 
help the babies.
M. M. C. S. SOPHMORES 
ENJOY THIRD DANCE
'Phe Sophomore Class of M. M. C. S. 
had its third dance in Recreation Hall 
on Friday, May 4, 1917. The crowd 
was rather small, but Steve Bowen’s 
orchestra created a lively spirit. Miss 
Browning was chaperon. The lights 
were decorated in the class color, pur­
ple. ReL’eshments consisted of lemon­
ade and cake.
DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC HOLDS SIXTH CONCERT
The sixth in the series of seven 
concerts was given by the depart­
ment of music on Sunday evening, 
May G, in the Theater of the School 
of Applied Design, before a large 
and enthusiastic audience. The pro­
gram was one of the most interest­
ing of the season both as regards 
variety and excellence of perform­
ance. Mr. Charles Gilson opened the 
program with Bach’s organ prelude 
ancV Fugue in “E” minor, which was 
well received. Mr. Replogle fol­
lowed with the Andante movement 
from the 'Cello Concerts No. 9— 
Romberg, which met with cordial 
applause.
Mozart’s Concerts in “D” minor— 
for piano and orchestra—was one of 
the most interesting numbers on the 
program. The orchestra was in un­
usually good form on this occasion 
and gave the soloist (Miss Ethel 
Shuman), the most delicate support; 
Her playing' was artistic to a de­
gree—her tone clear and musical, 
her phrasing intelligent and her at­
tack sure. One forgot her individual 
work in its perfect blending with 
the orchestral part and right here 
lies the secret of artistic success— 
the pei'former must be willing to be 
lost in the performance, only then can 
he reach the heights. The delight 
of the audience was manifest in 
vociferous applause and two recalls.
Mr. Roland Bellingham played 
Wieniawski’s "Legend” for violin. 
I-Ie brought out the beautiful plain­
tive quality of the number most suc­
cessfully. His tone was sympath­
etic arid the performance indicated 
an artistic understanding of the com­
poser’s conception.
Godard’s "Sur le Lac,” (’cello), 
brought forward a new candidate 
for public favor, in the persons of 
Mr. George Wilkins, whose playing 
was not only very enjoyable but a 
credit to himself and his instructor. 
His work was quite free from the 
nervous raggedness, one naturally 
expects to find in a first perform­
ance, and gives promise of fuller 
artistic development.
It was a. great pleasure to find 
Mr. Samuel Gluck’s name on the pro­
gram for two violin solos — the 
Scliubert-Wilheling "Ave-Maria” and 
Kreisler’s "Caprice Viennos”—both 
of which were given with an artistic 
finish unusual outside of "Artist Re­
citals”—Mr. Gluck is to be con­
gratulated on his progress, which 
the audience was not slow to recog­
nize, the applause being deafening 
and ceasing only after two recalls.
The closing number Scliuman’s 
Concerts in "A” minor for piano and 
orchestra (First movement), with 
Mr. Robert McGowan at the piano 
was very cordially received. Mr. 
McGowan’s attack was sure and he 
kept his theme well in evidence 
throughout the performance. The 
closing concert of the series is to 
bo given 011 Friday afternoon, May 
25th, at 4:30 o’clock.
cent of their work with the first-year 
class are considered Plebes. Only 
those Plebes who have undergone the 
Plebe Regulations in another branch 
of Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
or who have experienced similar good 
fortune in some other college, may ap­
ply for exemptions.
The committee will try and sentence 
all violators, and the Sophomores will 
carry out the decisions of this court.
