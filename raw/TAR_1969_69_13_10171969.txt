Piftsburgh's Beautiful March; 
Just "Give Peace a Chance
by Janice Richman
I think the march started for 
me on Tuesday. As part of a small 
hardcore who fasted, I spent a 
dizzy day starting with the pre­
moratorium rally. Glenn Granne- 
mann and Tom Burgess quietly 
explained the courage of their 
commitment (Resistance is a way 
of life); Mike Spring sang “Busi­
ness as Usual,” which ironically 
was not prophetic for Wednes­
day, and I sang the only song that 
I’ll ever write, inspired by Joan 
Baez. Then we all sang “Down 
by the Riverside” for the first 
time and everybody shook hands 
around the world.
After crowding into the Tartan 
Grill for the Guerrilla Theatre, 
we made a hasty exit from the un­
usually tempting brownies and 
formed a circle in Skibo Lounge. 
When we sang “Down by the Riv­
erside” for the fourth time to a 
group of very young people who 
loved shaking hands around the 
world and promised they’d all 
come back (they were being shep­
herded around by a nun), I thought 
the music had said all it could. 
But we went on forever, singing 
in a circle where you could look 
straight into anyone’s eyes.
Then I helped put up an exhibit 
on the Vietnam Moratorium that
Moratorium Impact 
On Entire Country
While an estimated 12,000 demonstrators turned out against the 
war in Pittsburgh on the 15th, millions of others across the nation ob­
served the Moritorium in their own ways, with rallies, marches, and 
silent vigils in honor of the war dead.
One focal point for the Moratorium’s participation was in the na­
tion’s capital, where on the floors of the House and the Senate, in the 
streets, on the steps of the capital, and on college campuses, speeches 
were made imploring the adminis-
b
had been destroyed Monday night. 
Posters, articles, schedules — 
nothing was left but some UPI 
photographs of Vietnam. By Wed­
nesday morning, even those were 
gone. Instead of our second ex­
hibit — admittedly less artistical­
ly arranged than the first — a few 
mimeographed leaflets “Victory 
in Vietnam” gave a clue to the 
identity of the vandals. We did not 
put up a third exhibit.
All this was a strange prologue 
to a beautiful march. As a mar­
shal, I got to run up and down 
most of the C-MU line—700 strong 
—encouraging people to run and 
close the gaps caused by the end­
less sequence of traffic lights. 
The dramats had everyone sing­
ing “All That We’re Saying Is 
Give Peace a Chance” to the beat 
of their drum all the way through 
the Hill and beyond. I heard other 
groups singing “Down by the Riv­
erside” for the nth time.

MMCC To Die? 
Proposals Offered
A proposal to drop the entire degree-granting program of Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie College was proposed on Oct. 14 to the Uni­
versity’s Faculty Senate. The Faculty Senate’s educational policy coun­
cil made the proposal. This council is made up of faculty members, 
administrators, and students.
The council proposed that the University accept no more students 
for admission to either undergraduate work or graduate work in 
MMCC, but there was considerable opposition to the plan by students 
who asked for a one-year delay in putting the plan into effect.
Since such departments as Eng- '
lish and History, once offered by 
MMCC, are now included in the 
new College of Humanities and So­
cial Sciences, the MMCC only of­
fers such studies as foods and nu­
trition, clothing and textiles, and 
business studies.
According to Dr. Erwin R. 
Steinberg, “We have a commit­
ment to women’s education, but 
we have been seeking a meaning­
ful function for the college to 
serve.”
The educational policy council 
also made three proposals for the 
University to consider in its aim 
to educate women: 1) That a mas­
ters degree program be offered in 
early childhood education, 2) 
That MMCC continue to research 
the role of the educated woman in 
American society, and 3) That 
there be a continuation of the ed­
ucational center for mature wom­
en to prepare them in specific 
fields.
The declining enrollment in the 
college was the primary reason 
for the policy decision. According 
to the council the enrollment now 
stands at less than 135 students, 
and there were merely 41 fresh­
men entered this fall. The fact 
also remains that the present fac­
ulty, now near retirement age, 
will have to be replaced by top- 
notch new members, and there is 
great difficulty in finding these 
proposed new faculty members. 
By the time the present freshmen 
students graduate, in 1973, all but 
one of the present home econom­
ics faculty members will have 
reached retirement age.
tration to disengage itself from 
the war. Government employees 
observed a silent vigil on the steps 
of the capital building. Participa­
tion involved about 1,000.
In New York City, Mayor John 
Lindsay ordered flags to be low­
ered in sympathy with the cause. 
Wall Street magnates set up Mor­
atorium booths. The mass of peo­
ple assembled there represented 
a united wall of humanity against 
the war. A few of the opposition 
were also evident, holding signs 
proclaiming “Bomb Hanoi.”
In San Francisco, marchers set 
out early in the morning to troop 
into the city across the Golden 
Gate bridge.
Many congressmen and sena­
tors got into the act individually. 
Senator Edward Kennedy called
fof “unilateral withdrawl from 
Vietnam within the year.” Demo­
cratic leader Mike Mansfield call­
ed the Moratorium a dramatic 
demonstration of public impati­
ence with a war that drags on with 
no end in sight. Fifteen Republi­
can congressmen, however, chose 
the day to sign a letter to the Pres­
ident urging “sudden and major 
escalation” of the war. And in At­
lanta, Lester Maddox stated that 
the Moratorium “will strengthen 
the cause of the communists.” 
Meanwhile, however, Senator Mc­
Govern praised the demonstra­
tions as the “highest patriotism.” 
Sympathy, while not unanimous 
among the nation’s political lead­
ers, seemed to be running high.
The Moratorium was observed 
to some extent outside the U.S. In
(Continued on Page 3)
According to Steinberg, the 
Faculty Senate has the final say 
on the matter at hand before the 
proposal goes to the President 
and the Board of Trustees. If the 
proposal goes through, incoming 
freshmen women will have to en­
ter either the College of Human­
ities and Social Sciences, the Col­
lege of Fine Arts, or Carnegie 
Institute of Technology.
The council noted that govern­
ment support of such courses of­
fered by MMCC has been made 
more available for state colleges 
than it has for such private insti­
tutions as C-MU. Steinberg also 
urged an early decision on the mat­
ter, since the Admission Office of 
the University already is receiv­
ing inquiries and applications for 
the upcoming fall term.
At a meeting of the Faculty Sen­
ate Tuesday the faculty put off un­
til next month a decision on 
whether to phase out the home 
economics courses.
The Senate considered a recom­
mendation by the educational po­
licy council which said that all 
four courses in the college would 
be phased out because of dwind­
ling enrollments.
The Faculty Senate tabled the 
decision until next month’s meet­
ing or until a special meeting is 
called.

Wolfenstein Views Stever Manifesto
Editor, qla qiARis1
In his talk on Sept. 22, President 
Stever emphasized as a basic 
principle that the University must 
not engage in “political action.” A 
similar statement has been made 
by my collegue. Professor Grif­
fiths, in a letter to the qiARis of 
Oct. 3. The trouble with these pos­
itions lies in their failure to rec­
ognize that the University has in 
the past and continues to take po­
litical action. The real issue is 
where the University stands when 
it is forced to take political ac­
tion.
On that same Sept. 22, I receiv­
ed in the mail a copy of the Stever 
manifesto on “disruptive” dem­
onstrations, one of the hottest 
political subjects in the country 
today. Here I find outlined possi­
ble actions the University might 
take, including “injunctive pro­
cesses” and “assistance from 
law enforcement officials,” which 
are highly political in character.
Indeed, who are the “law en­
forcement officials” referred to 
by President Stever? Are these 
the Pittsburgh police who brutal­
ly assaulted the Black Construc­
tion Committee march on Bloody 
Tuesday? Are these the Pittsburgh 
police noted for their unjustified 
harassment and arrests of inno­
cent people in Shadyside? Or per­
haps such defenders of the consti­
tution as Mr. Duggan? Just to re­
fer to such people as “law enforce­
ment officials” is a political act.
The decision of the University 
on Sept. 23 to ask for an injunc­
tion and, in particular, the word­
ing of the injunction were again 
political actions. The injunction 
was obviously worded by lawyers 
whose whole orientation was to­
wards the business world and who 
did not care about civil liberties. 
When Vice-president Kibbee was 
asked, during the Senate debate 
on Sept. 30, as to the constitution­
ality of the limit on picketing, he 
said in effect that the University 
has no interest in the constitu­
tional rights of its students and 
faculty. That too is a political 
position.
There are many other political 
positions taken by the University 
in its relation to the community 
and its choice of research.
What does President Stever 
mean by being non-political? Bas­
ed on observations I will hazard a 
guess. When President Stever’s 
political actions are directed by 
his right-wing friends or his es­
tablishment lawyers, then they 
are non-political. But when fac­
ulty and students urge President 
Stever to act in a liberal and hu­
mane fashion, that is impossible, 
because that is political.

Turn Out Lites
Editor, qla qiARis1
I would like to suggest that all 
the indoor lighting of Warner Hall 
be turned off at night when the 
building is not in use, and that a 
check be sent each month for the 
money saved by this action to aid 
VISTA or some other organiza­
tion in service to America’s poor.

Anti-war Rally on Tuesday 
Mocks Vietnam Involvement
mr bresar oacsmaAp
Tech began its Moritorium on Tuesday with an 
anti-war rally on the cut. The cold discouraged a 
large attendance; there were only about 35 people 
to listen to the first speaker, who, unfortunately, 
could not be understood.
The rally was transferred to the ballroom and 
the number of spectators increased. The next 
speaker was Glenn Grannaman. A former member 
of the Reserves, he felt a moral obligation to turn 
in his draft card. He explained his reasons to the 
crowd which now stood and sat on the ballroom 
floor.
Tom Burgess spoke next. He refused induction 
19 hours after graduation. It is his belief that you
can’t just Rik; about making things better, you must 
JyA; to make them better. Revolution is not enough; 
it only changes the roles of oppressor and oppressed.
While waiting for the Guerilla Theater to make 
its appearance, guitars were produced and an im­
promptu singing session started. A sudden an­
nouncement that the theater had started in the Tar­
tan Grill sent everyone rushing out of the ballroom. 
The players sang “America the Beautiful” while 
chanting such classic slogans as “Better Dead Than 
Red” and “Support Our Boys.” The performance 
culminated in the mock execution of a Viet Cong 
soldier and the dispersal of the players and every­
one else.
Thieu Invites Students
College students, especially 
those who are anti-war, have been 
invited by South Vietnames Pres­
ident Nguyen Van Thieu to visit 
South Vietnam for an inspection 
of the war zone.
“I think they will change their 
minds,” the President said during 
a tour of the northern province of 
Thau Thien.
“I will welcome them in the In­
dependence Palace. I will lead 
them on a visit and show them 
how the Vietnamese troops are 
fighting on the ground ...”
Thieu attended a funeral cere­
mony at Hue, the former imperial 
capital 390 miles north-northeast 
of Saigon, for hundreds of civili­
ans killed by the Communists dur­
ing the 1968 Tet offensive.
The bodies were discovered in 
recent months in mass graves.
Speaking in Vietnames, the 
President said that the war dem­
onstrations Wednesday were “a 
very normal thing in America” 
but that the dissenters did not 
represent the opinion of the ma­
jority.
“First, this is a very normal 
thing in America, in a free and 
democratic country where the cit­
izen has the right tmsay every­
thing he wants to say,” he said.
“Secondly, the anti-war senti­
ment reflects a minority of the 
opinion of the American people, 
not the large majority of the 
American people.”
Thieu was later asked whether 
he had “anything specific” to say 
to American college students who 
organized and participated in the 
Moratorium.
“I think that I will welcome any 
delegation of the college students 
who would like to come here and 
who represent all of the anti-war 
factions,” he said.
He also said he expected per­
haps 100 American protest lead­
ers might take up his offer “ii 
they would like to see the truth in 
Vietnam.”

Students Make Statements on Dissolving MMCC
The people who are a part of 
C-MU are well aware of Dean 
Steinberg’s recommendation, 
which was approved by the Edu­
cational Policy Council, to phase 
out the business and human re­
source studies provided by MM 
CC. No until September of this 
year were the students permit­
ted to know of Dean Steinberg’s 
actions. A visiting committee 
composed partly of alumnae of 
C-MU recommended that, situ­
ations being what they were, 
MMCC not admit freshman in 
September, 1970.
We as students want a re­
vision of the existing programs 
offered in business and human re­
source studies to the extent that 
they will offer subjects more per­
tinent to the professions involved, 
research options designed toward 
graduate school, and an updating 
of existing programs where the 
students feel it is necessary.
It is to the credit of MMCC 
that it has been able to attract 
a rather steady number of stu­
dents each year considering:
1. The lack of cooperation 
from the Admissions Office,
2. the propagation of the old 
CIT image of a school for en­
gineers and artists,
3. the fact that we do not have 
a dean who is involved in bus­
iness and human resource stu­
dies,
4. the attitude of students in 
Fine Arts and CIT that business 
and human resource studies are 
for Do-do’s and are not as wor­
thy of studying as the profes­
sions in the other colleges,
5. watered down courses have 
shoved under the the name of 
MMCC instead of remaining 
in their related departments.
Moratorium
(Continued, from Page 1)
Parris, about 70 American stu­
dents demonstrated in the court­
yard of the American Embassy. 
About 200 marched before the 
Embassy in London. Even in Sai­
gon, a group of civilian workers 
held a moment of silent prayer for 
the end of the war with the U.S. 
ambassador, Ellsworth Bunker. 
Up near the DMZ a few soldiers 
donned black arm bands in sym­
pathy with the Moratorium ‘back 
home.
Where we go from here will not 
be readily apparent in the face of 
the immediate and profuse enthu­
siasm of the demonstrators and 
the reactions of pro-war factions. 
The trees are a little too thick 
right now for those in the forest. 
But plans are already under way 
for November’s March on Wash­
ington. Perhaps in the month that 
follows, definite direction will 
evolve of itself. Or perhaps even 
the long-hoped for response will 
come from the White House in the 
form of definitive action on the 
part of the U.S. toward withdraw­
ing from the war.
The visiting committee found 
a struggling college that, consi­
dering these odds that were 
against it, was able to provide a 
first-rate education with lit­
tle support from any other part 
of the university. We now present 
reasons for the continuation of 
business and resource studies at 
C-MU.
The professions offered in bus­
iness and human resource stu­
dies are expanding and be­
coming more important every 
year. It is hard for engineers to 
understand that fashion is im­
portant to our standard of living 
just as it is hard for a person de­
dicated to the fine arts to under­
stand that people are needed to 
fill occupations as “common” as 
executive secretaries. What is 
surprising is the fact that peo­
ple involved in urban affairs do 
not recognize the affect of nu­
trition on a child’s intelligence 
or the affect of a good home en­
vironment on the healthy develop­
ment of a neighborhood. Man 
cannot live only on pure tech­
nology and the arts.
Unfortunately the connota­
tion of “home” in the term home 
economics has led people to be­
lieve that the related professions 
deal with house-keeping. The 
comforts of living as we realize 
them in our lives are not avail­
able to those who lack the fun­
damental knowledge of economy 
in the home.
The clothing we wear did 
jiot get from the fiber produc­
ers to the stores by osmosis. It 
needed researchers, designers, 
buyers, and merchandisers.
The idea of a balanced diet 
did not come out of an organic 
chemist’s test tube. It needed 
researchers, nutritionists, and 
people able to communicate these 
findings to the public. Hospi­
tals are without trained diet­
icians because they are not en­
ough dieticians to fill the va­
cancies.
A person gaining admissions 
into the AMS curriculum is told 
that a bachelor’s degree needs 
a master’s degree to be worth­
while. The business studies un­
der question provides a skill 
plus a well rounded education 
and a college atmosphere not 
available in a two year program.
March
(Continued from Page 1)
I laughed at the hoarse rasps 
of the people who had led the 
“Peace Now” chants with what 
was left of my voice. I flashed the 
peace sign at high school kids, a 
hell of a lot of my classmates, all 
my friends at Pitt and Teach, and 
half the faculty in my department.
I have to believe the person who 
told me 20,000 people had been 
counted in Point State Park. It’s 
got to be the most incredible 
march Pittsburgh has ever creat­
ed, whether Nixon likes it or not.
Maternity, as well as military, 
leaves are not plentiful in the 
business world. The training 
provided in this type of a pro­
gram allows a person to return to 
work after a leave of absence 
and earn a living.
We feel that the problems of 
“decreasing” enrollment in the 
business and human resource stu­
dies is due to the lack of infor­
mation available to persons de­
siring these studies in a private 
school. Girl’s private high schools 
are not visited by C-MU recrui­
ters. The question of tuition de­
ferring future students can be 
answered by the aid available to 
students in need ol help. We feel 
that from these two sources there 
are enough students qualifying 
for admissions who would ap­
ply if they knew of the programs 
offered at C-MU. We therefore 
are willing to cooperate with the 
Admissions Office in the recruit­
ing of these students, but we 
need the support of the univer­
sity.
Up to this time, the faculty 
and students of MMCC have 
askes questions and received no 
answers. We have dealth poli­
tely with the situation and have 
tried not to step on the fing­
ers of those who were pulling 
the rug from under our feet. We 
now publicly address our ques­
tions to every one concerned with 
the anhilation of the programs in 
business and human resource stu­
dies, and particularly to the 
following persons:
Dean Steinberg,
1. Why weren’t the students of 
business and human resource stu­
dies informed sooner of the rec- 
omendation you presented to the 
Educational Policy Council?
2. Why did the visiting com­
mittee not confer with the stu­
dents before their decision was 
reached?
3. Why were not the alumnae 
informed of the course of ac­
tion?
4. Why have you not present­

Lighter Penalties for Grass?
A top Nixon aide indicated 
this week that the Administra­
tion is expected to urge the el­
imination of prescribed jail sen­
tences for possession of mari­
juana, leaving the actual sen­
tence up to the discretion of the 
judge.
Dr. Roger O. Egeberg, assis­
tant secretary of Health, Edu­
cation and Welfare, said that 
HEW, the House Crime Com­
mittee and the Justice Depart­
ment have “developed several 
laternative penalty structures”
in addition to the less severe 
ones already proposed to Congress 
by the Nixon administration.
The law presently calls for 
jail terms of two to five years on 
the first offense of possession of 
marijuana and up to 20 years 
for the third offense.
The Administration bill al­
ready sent to Congress proposed 
probation for the first offense, 
two to ten years for the second, 
and 10 to 20 for the third offense.
Mr. Egeberg indicated that 
these proposals would be liberal­
ized further. But committee staff 
members failed to get a conces­
sion from Theodore Ellenbogen, 
an HEW attorney, that more lib­
eral proposals, including the el­
imination of prescribed sentences, 
would be sent to Congress soon.
However, staff members said 
that they understood the Ad­
ministration would propose that 
all arrests for the possession of 
marijuana would be classified 
as misdemeanors and that there 
be mandatory jail sentences.
5. This question is directed to 
you as an English professor who 
has nursed the H?SS college from 
its conceptions. Would the dis­
missal of business and human re­
source studies permit the admis­
sion of more students into the 
H&SS programs?
6. Why does the college con­
taining business and human re­
source studies not have a dean 
who knows what is going on in 
the professions involved?
7. It has been stated that a 
major reason for the phasing out 
of these programs is the decrease 
in enrollment for the past twenty 
years. You cannot provide reasons 
for this trend. Why have you not 
investigated the causes?
Admissions Office:
1. Why do C-MU recruiters 
not have sufficient information 
to give to prospective students 
who wish to enter business and 
human resource studies? Why 
are these studies usually ignor­
ed?
2. Why was there not a better 
attempt to inform prospective 
students about the business and 
human resource programs offer­
ed when the admission started to 
“decline?”
3. Were there not members on 
Mortar Board who were in FA 
and CIT when Mortar Board re­
cruited students? Were they as­
sisted by the Admissions Of­
fice?
4. Is it true that standards for 
admissions are sometimes low­
ered for MMCC students? If 
so, why is this polity practiced?
“Student Representatives”
1. How much of an attempt 
did you make to understand the 
feelings of business and hu­
man resource students before you 
voted at the Educational Policy 
Council meeting?
2. Why did you not meet with 
business and human resource stu­
dents?
3. How could you intelligent­
ly vote as representatives of the 
students when you did not under­
stand the situation?
These questions have been 
tossed around since students 
were permitted to know about 
the fate of their professions 
at C-MU. We want the answers in 
writing. In addition to these 
questions we also ask if the MMCC 
removal sets the precedent for 
other professions at C-MU, 
namely the metallurgy, chem­
ical engineering, and civil en­
gineering departments?

War To End 
Anytime Now
According to some stastical 
formulas of a former Stanford 
university researcher, the fight­
ing in Vietnam probably will 
end almost any month now.
Dr. John Voevodsky, now a 
private consultant, reached his 
conclusion from equations in­
volving battle statistics from four 
equations involving battle sta­
tistics from four major United 
States conflicts, the Civil War, 
the two world wars, and the Kor­
ean war.
A study submitted to the Navy 
in May, 1868 by Dr. Voevodsky 
predicting casuality rates and 
other figures on the basis of 
mathematical equations have pro­
ven accurate within one or two 
percent, the Doctor stated.
“I’m not a soothsayer,” he 
said. “I’m just saying what the 
statistical trends indicate.”
His charts suggest both sides 
in the Vietnam war are now at 
a point where they will either 
cease hostilities or commence 
a major escalation.
For the United States, this 
could mean doubling its mili­
tary forces in Vietnam to more 
than one million men.
This decision, Dr. Voevodsky 
said, already should have been 
made, according to the charts, 
will become known before the 
end of the Vietnam rainy sea­
son.
He plots the relationships be­
tween battle casualties and 
deaths, troop strength and cas­
ualties, and troop strength and the 
time it takes for the war to end.

The Tragedies of War 
Protest Films Illuminate
by Sara Cooper
In protest of the war and in conjunction with the Vietnam Mora­
torium events, four films were presented on Wednesday morning, Oct. 
15, in Skibo.
Over 500 persons, most of them wearing arm bands in sympathy, 
viewed these films in an aura of concern which reinforced an attitude 
of complete disillusionment and anger at the senselessness and futility 
that has been precipitated by the continuation of the war effort in Viet­
nam. ....... ......................—
“Culloden” by the BBC was a 
remake of the 18th Century Bat­
tle at Culloden in Great Britain. 
Nine thousand British and Scot­
tish clansmen fought in vain — 
“killing a race of people.” The 
Scots were pathetically slaughter­
ed at the hands of the ruthless 
British and through all their ef­
forts “created a desert and call­
ed it peace.” The simple analogy 
to Vietnam can be made in pure 
statistics — 40,000 men have been 
pathetically slaughtered, and in
Page 4—THE TARTAN—Friday, October 17, 1969
Focusing on the frightened and 
bewildered families of Vietnam, 
“The Time of the Locust” illus­
trated in harsh and unfeeling 
terms the atrocities, torture and 
mass plunder of the Vietnames 
people. The contrast of Saigon 
nightlife with the marshes and 
swamps clearly showed the total 
duality by which the Asian coun­
try exists from day to day.
Superimposed over this film 
was the voice of Lyndon Johnson 
in excerpts from speeches on his 
war policy. This commentary and 
its supposed overtones of peace 
by Johnson were in essence 
merely humorous retorts to the 
grave situation.
An experimental Polish film, 
“The Magicial,” capitalized on 
the innocence of youth, deviously 
enticed into the bizarre and cruel 
world of war games. Devoid of 
any speaking, the film employed 
the music of the calliope to follow 
the unknowing boys through “in­
doctrination” to their develop­
ment of the sinister war intellect. 
Accomplished through the guise 
of fun and games, the innocents 
lost their sense of reality and 
and gave way to the stark naked­
ness of war.
vain.
The final movie, “Vietnam — 
How Did We Get in—How Do We 
Get Out?” was a documentary 
speech by David Schoenxaum. He 
stated that it is not the Vietna­
mese people or their communist 
doctrine that has changed since 
Ho Chi Mihn but that it is the Unit­
ed States which has changed.
At the conclusion of the movie, 
Schoenbaum offered a rationale 
for the ending of the Vietnam War 
and perhaps hope for America to­
day: “Our country right or
wrong? If it is right, let us pre­
serve that right, but if it is wrong, 
let us work to right that wrong.”

Agnew Takes A Stand 
On Letter From Hanoi
Massive demonstrations, including the lowering of flags to half- 
staff, rallies, discussions, marches, teach-ins, and prayers, took place 
across the country Wednesday, Oct. 15.
Amidst the demonstrations, other developments took place. In 
Washington Tuesday,20 congressmen who have been most vocal 
about the war planned an all-night session of Congress.

In Paris, the Hanoi Govern­
ment, in a public statement, hail­
ed the demonstrations as a “time­
ly rebuff” to the Nixon adminis­
tration and also as an expression 
of the American peoples’ will “to 
save their children and brothers 
from a useless death in Vietnam.”
Vice-President Agnew, urged 
on by President Nixon, called Ha­
noi’s statement a “shocking in­
trusion into the affairs of the 
American people.”
Appearing at a White House 
press conference, he challenged 
the leaders of the Moratorium to 
repudiate the expression of sup­
port from the Premier of North 
Vietnam.
Agnew denied that he was lead­
ing a last-minute campaign to un­
dermine the Moratorium and dis­
credit the protest.
Mr. Agnew said that the lead­
ers of the Moratorium should 
“repudiate the support of a totali­
tarian government which has on its 
hands the blood of 40,000 Amer- 
cans.”
He said further that the Mora­
torium leaders were now 
“chargeable with the knowledge 
of this letter” and must clearly 
enunciate the purpose of the dem­
onstrations.
When a reporter asked Agnew 
how the demonstrators could dis­
associate themselves with the let­
ter from Hanoi, the Vice-Presi­
dent said :
“That’s up to them. They or­
ganized the demonstration. Let 
them ficure out how to exDlain it.”
In response to the letter and 
Mr. Agnew’s statement, the Mor­
atorium leaders issued a state­
ment which said:
“Oct. 15 is an appeal to the con­
science of the American people. 
It is regrettable the Administra­
tion would seize this straw in an 
attempt to discredit the patriot­
ism of the millions of Americans 
who sincerely desire peace.”
In the meantime, President 
Nixon was continuing his low-key 
effort of recent weeks to empha­
size his desire for peace on terms 
that would protect the self-inter­
est of South Vietnam and the 
credibility of United States for­
eign policy in Southeast Asia.
Elsewhere in the world, Presi­
dent Nguyen Van Thieu said he 
was confident that the majority 
of Americans backed the allied 
war effort.
In New York City, Mayor Lnd- 
say, despite growing opposition— 
especially from veteran organiza­
tions, the police and firemen, re­
mained firm in his decision to 
participate in the Moratorium. He 
proclaimed a day of observance to 
mourn the Vietnam war dead. He 
also planned to deck City Hall in 
mourning and lower th^ flag 
there.

It’s only one of the imaginative ways 
you can use your talent at Norden. 
Because here, we see things a bit 
differently. Technologically. Crea­
tively. And in business.
One example is the Contact Analog 
system you see above. Displaying al­
titude, air speed, attitude, velocity 
vector, and other flight information 
into easily-assimilated pictorial form. 
With virtually limitless applications 
for air/spacecraft, on land, or under 
sea.
Interesting? We think so. But what it 
says about Norden may interest you
more.
Technologically, Contact Analog rep­
resents a sophisticated utilization of 
analog and digital techniques, illus­
trating the kind of interdisciplinary 
activity that’s made our team prob­
lem-solving approach so successful. 
Creatively, it demonstrates the fact 
that new ideas—even radical ones— 
get past the ‘idea’ stage at Norden. 
And from a business standpoint, in­
dicates the fact that Norden’s suc­
cess is based upon innovation. 
Innovation in areas like pilot dis­
plays, airborne radar systems, 
ground support equipment, optical 
devices and computer technology.

technical horizons, why not look into

Resnick, Rapping Talks 
Favor Troop Withdrawl
by Jeff Ruben
The American people are being deceived by the Nixon Administra­
tion. Partial withdrawls and seemingly lower draft calls do not accom­
plish anything toward ending the war in Vietnam, and therefore our 
only alternative is the immediate and complete withdrawl of all Amer­
ican forces from Vietnam. These were the basic conclusions reached 
by Dr. Daniel Resnick of the History Department and Dr. Leonard Rap­
ping of GSIA in a panel discussion held in Skibo ballroom during the 
Moratorium. An enthusiastic audience seemed to concur.
March for Peace
Grannemann Returns 
Draft Cards to Board
Dr. Resnick began by discuss­
ing what he feels to be the main 
obstacles in the way of the extri­
cation of our troops from Viet­
nam. He cited:
1. The support of our govern­
ment for the Thieu-Ky regime, 
even though it is not representa­
tive of the South Vietnamese peo­
ple.
2. The intention of the U.S. to be 
bastion in Southeast Asia against 
Communist China. The knowledge 
of this intent, Dr. Resnick feels, 
will keep the war going for an in­
definite period of time.
3. Our government’s refusal to 
accept the reality that the Viet 
Cong control at least half the ter­
ritory of South Vietnam.
4. A weakness in America’s 
peace movement stemming from 
the fact that few Americans ac­
tually know any Vietnames peo­
ple. The peace movement in this 
country has been basically nega­
tive against our own government 
rather than positively for the Vi­
etnames people.
5. The stealing of American 
symbols, such as the flag, by pro­
war factions. This has created the 
confusion among non-politicized 
Americans as to whether the 
American flag symbolizes peace 
or right-wing reactionism. Dr. 
Resnick feels this is changing,
The Vietnam Moratorim has 
evoked a fantastic volume of 
rhetoric from supporters and op­
position alike. Amidst the tide of 
words, however, what the Mora­
torium is about has got lost. Let 
us sum up, then, what argu­
ments, pro and con, are being of­
fered by Moratorium organizers 
and by the Nixon Administration.
According to the organizers, 
Oct. 15 is a day for Americans to 
take time off from their usual pur­
suits to demonstrate for “an im­
mediate and final end to Ameri­
can involvement in the Vietnam 
War.” The demonstration is need­
ed, says the pro faction, because 
'Americans and Vietnamese are 
dying needlessly . . . South Viet­
nam is being destroyed . . . and 
America’s national priorities are 
distorted” as the nation moves no 
closer to a resolution.
- The Administration agrees that 
there has been no progress at 
Paris, but sees some accom­
plishment in withdrawing U.S. 
troops, de-escalating the fighting, 
and turning over the war to the 
South Vietnamese.
Secretary of State Rogers has 
said that immediate withdrawl is 
impossible because of the ensu­
ing “tremendous massacre of the 
Population in South Vietnam.”

however, and he expressed hope 
that the American flag would soon 
be a symbol of the peace move­
ment.
Dr. Resnick proposed immedi­
ate withdrawl as the only alterna­
tive possible, but Dr. Rapping 
stated that there does exist an­
other alternative: the complete 
annihilation of the Vietnames peo­
ple and culture. His point was also 
clear; the troops must be with­
drawn. Dr. Rapping then present­
ed statistics and other informa­
tion to support his contention.
Rapping described most pres­
ent proposals for peace, such as 
the one made by college presi­
dents, as “vague,” and he cited 
a Rand Corporation study which 
showed that the costs of U.S. in­
volvement in Vietnam far out­
weigh any benefits that might be 
derived from this involvement. 
He used quotes from LBJ and Nix­
on to show the similarity in ob­
jectives of the two administra­
tions. The level of violence in Vi­
etnam will remain high even with 
the small troop withdrawls Nix­
on has proposed, asserted Dr. 
Rapping.
The discussion ended with a 
short question and answer period, 
followed by a round of applause 
which appeared to display support 
as well as thanks.
There is also feeling within the 
Administration that an American 
withdrawl would lower faith in 
U.S. commitments in Europe and 
Asia. The President feels that to 
change his position as a result of 
demonstrations would “invite an­
archy.”

Glen N. Grannemann, graduate 
student at C-MU, returned his 
draft card Sunday, Oct. 12. The 
public act of noncooperation took 
place during the 11 a.m. worship 
service of the Community of Re­
conciliation, a division of the Uni­
versity and City Ministries.
The cards, accompaned by a 
letter of explanation, were placed 
on the alter and Samuel N. Gib­

ed to forward them to Granne- 
mann’s draft board in Union, Mo.

Grannemann said, “This morn­
ing I am saying that both actions 
(registering with the SSS and en­
listing in the Army Reserves) 
were grave mistakes that have 
helped to increase man’s inhu­
manity to man.
“I think that an individaul can 
only relate to another individual 
in an atmosphere of trust that 
allows each person to fully real­
ize the dignity that is his simply 
because he is a human being. I 
think that this same atmosphere 
must be built into international 
relationships in this age where 
man has the power to destroy life 
on this planet earth. I feel that the 
existence of armies of men train­
ed to kill other men, particularly 
when these armies are startioned 
on foreign soil, is destructive of 
the trust we must develop among 
nations if we are to survive as a 
species of animal on earth. This 
belief is the basis for my refusal

said Grannemann.
UACM did not sponsor the act, 
but made it possible by providing 
in the service a section called 
“expression of conerns.”
Grannemann was a member of

IM REVIEW
In the first semifinal play­
off of the IM Football Season 
PKA upset the heavily favored 
ATO-A 31-27 with a come from 
behind victory in the final per­
iod. The game was hard fought 
all the way and each team scored 
but one point in the first quarter, 
ATO finally scored a TD and the 
halftime score was 8-2. At the 
beginning of the last quarter PKA 
was behind 13-10 but they broke 
open the ATO defense and scor­
ed four more TD’s to win a spot 
in the championship game against 
the winner of the Old Men — 
BTP-A game.
The Old Men vs. BTP game vic­
tor will play PKA in the cham­
pionship game Saturday at 3:00 
p.m. on the I.M. field and the 
consolation of ATO vs. Old Men- 
BTP loser will be 1:00 p.m. on 
Saturday.
In the first round of playoffs 
the first place team of one league 
played the second place team of 
another league. The Old Men, 
number one in the Packer 
League, defeated BTP-B of the 
Cowboys League 39-18. The

Tartans Seek First Win 
At Allegheny
The Tartans will hit the road again tomorrow in an effort to post their first victory of 
the season. Allegheny’s Gators, last year’s PAC champs, have lost to Bethany and John Car­
roll after topping Adelbert in their opener.
Old Men coasted to an easy 
victory after posting a 25-3 half- 
time lead.
SAE lost to PKA 44-24 in a 
first round playoff game. The 
score was 20-19 in favor of SAE 
at the half but in the second half 
the PKA defense held SAE to 
only four first downs and no 
TD’s.
ATO defeated EJ Panthers 26- 
15 in their playoff game before 
they lost the semifinal game to 
PKA. The game was primarily a 
defensive contest until the second 
half when ATO got a big lead in 
the third period. The EJ Pan­
thers tried to pull it out in the 
last period but -the ATO defense 
held.
After SN defeated Older Men 
55-0 in the playoff for second 
place in the Browns League, 
SN couldn’t get the same defense 
going against BTP-A. BTP-A 
defeated SN 43-13 and held the 
lead all the way.
The Oakland A’s won the Jag 
League Championship by com­
pleting the season undefeated, 
4-0.
The small CMU squad has been 
hit with a number of injuries 
thus far which have magnified 
the shortage of manpower, while 
severely effecting the team’s per­
formance. Tight end, Tony Bugel 
has been out with a sprained an­
kle, halfback Tom Lombardo has 
been playing with an injured 
thigh, and Bill Halsted has hurt 
his knee, to name a few. But the 
Tartans have been able to bounce 
back in previous years and this 
week would be a very opportune 
time.
However, Allegheny has a few 
points in its favor which will in­
crease the difficulty of the 
Tartans’ task. Their quarter­
back, Mike Ganey, is back after 
leading the PAC in total passing 
yardage and finishing runner- 
up in the scoring stats. Other 
Gators to watch out for are end 
Colin Smith (who caught 19 
passes for 6 tds in 1968), half­
back Dale Hahn (437 yards in 
118 carries plus 17 pass recep­
tions for 241 yards), halfback 
Mike Creenan (20 passes caught) 
and defensive halfbacks Dick 
Greenbaum (6 interceptions) 
and Jay Lewis.
Like the Tartans, Allegheny lost 
some of its top football players to 
graduation. Others didn’t come out 
for various reasons. This has caus­
ed the Gators to employ many 
freshman while forcing a few let- 
termen to go both ways.
Tomorrow is Allegheny’s home­
coming. It could be a very in­
teresting football game. For one 
dollar and a two hour bus ride, 
you can come out to support your 
CMU football team. It could be 
fun too. Game* time is 1:30 p.m.

Greenberg and Garver Discuss 
University’s Vietnam Involvement
by PAMELA HORNER
At 2:00 p.m. yesterday in the 
ballroom a discussion on the uni­
versity Military Comples took 
place between David Greenburg 
and Paul Garver.
Greenburg of the physics de­
partment was the first to speak. 
The beginning of his talk was 
about the lessons that the war 
has taught those who have op­
posed it. “We have come to view 
the War as something other than 
an isolated blunder by our policy­
makers. We see it as a typical 
example of U. S. foreign policy — 
even if you balk at calling it im­
perialism, the fact of workd- 
wide U. S. business and strategic 
interests and a demonstrated 
willingness to defend them mili­
tarily cannot be ignored.”
The universities have been 
highly mobilized for war. Scien­
tific research has been used for
the development of new mili­
tary techniques of combat and 
reconnaisence. The massive stu- 
dent-faculty discontent over the 
war is contrasted with the fact 
that back in the labs, research 
is going on for the next year and 
the next war. 400 million dollars 
has been granted universities for 
contracts in military research and 
development. The universities 
have come to depend on these 
contraets, and therefore on mili­
tary research.
Increasingly, the universities 
have become sensitive to the 
military complex and its money, 
and they are reluctant to jeopard­
ize this source.
Paul Garver, Department of 
History, talked about the indus­
trial side of the university-mili­
tary-industrial triangle. ‘Pitts­
burgh is an important city to the 
military and industrial com­
plex.” Here are located many 
of the major industries that sup­
ply the materials for war. De­
fence relies heavily on this sup­
ply. But the bond works the 
other way, too. As American cor­
porations become increasingly in­
ternational and with large holdings 
in other countries, they depend on 
the U. S. military to defend them 
against outside threats. In some 
respects, it is as if we have crea­
ted a large private army to pro­
tect private holdings.
How is C-MU connected to 
this military-industrial com­
plex? One of its primary bonds is 
through the Board of Trustees. 
By and large, the Board is con­
servative and largely made up of 
businessmen whose companies 
are those involved in production 
of war materials. A large pro­
portion work directly or indirec­
tly for the Mellons
