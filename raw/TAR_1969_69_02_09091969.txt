Stever Discusses Protests
On the University Campus
Editor's Note: The following is 
an open letter to the C-MU cam­
pus community from President
H. Guy ford Stever.
For over a year a number of 
people from the constituencies 
of this University have expressed 
their deep concern about the fu­
ture of higher education across the 
nation. Clearly the climate of 
American campuses is changing. 
There is growing concern within 
the academic community about 
the nature of the life of man in 
the twentieth century. And there 
has been concern about the changes 
occurring in the University 
community, especially that the 
university’s freedoms and its 
open character be maintained.
During the past year, Car- 
negie-Mellon has been engaged 
in a widespread discussion to
Student Questions
Segregated Housing
by MARY SULLIVAN
One of the foremost evils in our 
society is the propagation of 
legitimate segregation. George 
Wallace is one brand — an eas­
ily disregarded, easily seen 
through extreme. But a more 
subtle, and thus perhaps more 
dangerous, form is the univer­
sity instigated, sincere, question­
ing self segregation of our black 
students. Perhaps you haven’t 
heard, many students haven’t, 
that there is an all black floor in 
Tower E of Morewood Gardens.
There is an experimental pro­
gram on campus: Carnegie - Mel­
lon Action Program. The first of 
its premises pertaining to 5E 
Morewood is that the standards for 
measuring white readiness for col­
lege are one reason for the small 
number of Negros in college. 
The second is that once the blacks 
are in college, admitted under dif­
ferent standards, they need situa­
tional reinforcement.
Before registration, all C-Map 
students attend a learning sem­
inar. They learn how to take 
notes, what college is all about, 
et cetera. It’s a great idea. The 
only trouble is that while white 
students could benefit from the 
class too, only C-Map students are 
admitted. The seminar could al­
so be a fine source of “situa­
tional reinforcement” for the 
C-Map students if they could 
see that white students need­
ed to learn how to take notes as 
well.
Dean Swank, head of Student 
Affairs, claims the decision to 
create an all black floor was made 
in order to encourage the new C- 
Map students academically and 
socially by giving them a secur­
ity they claim they could not 
find among white students. But if 
the university’s motives are so idy­
llic, why are Swank and Rich­
ard Mullins, assistant head of C- 
Map, so evasive and contradictory
about the black floor issue? Mul­
lins said that 5E Morewood was 
definitely university generated” 
and that the students never re­
quested such a thing. On the 
other hand, Dean Swank men­
tioned that the decision to create 
the floor was made while he was 
on vacation. Convenient, wasn’t 
it?
When I asked Swank if there 
was an empty bed on the C-Map 
floor, would a white student be 
moved into it, his response was, 
“I haven’t answered that yet. I 
have been asked that question be­
fore, and I haven’t answered it 
yet.” In opposition to Mullin’s 
assumption that the C-Map boys 
would be broken up into inte­
grated housing as soon as possi­
ble, Swank said that they would 
be kept together as long as neces­
sary for academic and social en­
couragement.
A clue to the creation mys­
tery was provided by Mrs. Jean 
Craig, head resident of More­
wood, who said that all of the 
C-Map girls had their room 
keys at the time they arrive at the 
doorm, and that C-Map handled all 
housing problems and decisions 
for C-Map students.
When I talked to the boys, on 5E 
they were open, friendly, and logi­
cal in their reasons for all black 
housing. None of them had any­
thing against white students ex­
cept perhaps that there were 
more girls available to white boys. 
But none of them would be surpris­
ed to receive negative vibrations 
from the whites. So living to­
gether is easier, and it’s always saf­
er to ask a brother for help in phy­
sics than a white student.
When confronted with a hypo­
thetical choice between a black 
Harvard and a predominantly 
white Harvard, the C-Map boys in­
variably said the would go to 
the black Harvard. None of them
at least for this semester. Next 
semester or next year is another 
story that isn’t written yet. By 
then they may be ready for 
white floormates. Several of the 
students wish they had been giv­
en a choice. So do I. But none of 
them knew until they unpacked 
that 5E Morewood was all black.
These boys are right in all as­
pects except one in wanting a seg­
regated floor, dorm, or school. I 
believe the administration is 
aware of that reason; is nervous 
because it is copping out, back­
ing down. You aren’t going to go 
very far unless you’re willing 
to take your chances and knocks. 
But just sometimes the friends you 
make are worth all the bad times. 
This is my second year at C-MU 
I hadn’t met one black person on 
campus until I talked to the 
boys on 5E, and my roommate 
has made only one black friend 
here. We’d like a chance for more. 
When I talked to the boys on 5E, 
they said ours was the first “real 
conversation” they’d had “out­
side of the brothers.” I believe 
they should have a chance for 
more.

attempt to understand these 
changes and to develop mech­
anisms to enhance excellence in 
our students’ educational exper­
ience. Some of these discussions 
have been both productive and 
enjoyable. We believe that we have 
made progress but that we must 
continue in this effort. We 
should note also, that there have 
been peaceful demonstrations dur­
ing the past year which were re­
sponsibly carried out by students 
concerned about the university 
or some social cause. As expres­
sions of free speech entirely prop­
er in the University community, 
they followed the guidelines in 
the Carnegie Student Handbook:
CMU recognizes the right and 
privilege of all students to ex­
ercise the constitutional guaran­
tees of free assembly and ex­
pression. As a university sincere­
ly espousing the philosophy of 
academic freedom, CMU urges 
and supports its students’ de­
sires and efforts to pursue these 
rights.
In instances where students 
wish to use these rights through 
protest or demonstration the rights 
and privileges of others must 
be considered. Thus,
1. The protest or demonstra­
tion must be of an orderly nature 
so that no acts of force or vio­
lence shall occur and the nor­
mal orderly operation of the Uni­
versity will not be impeded.
2. The protest or demonstra­
tion shall not infringe upon the 
rights or privileges of students not 
in sympathy with it. Thus, all stu­
dents are assured that the ideas 
or desires of others shall not be 
inflicted upon them and that they 
will be allowed to exercise the 
right of free choice.
Calendar
Changes 
To Affect
Exams
The following changes in the
1969-70 academic calendar were 
approved unanimously on April 
28, 1969 by the Educational Pol­
icy Council.
1. Change starting date of fin­
al exams in the first semester from 
Saturday, December 13, to Mon­
day, December 15. (This was an 
error in printing of the calendar.
2. Change the dates of Spring 
Carnival from April 24 and 25, 
1970 to April 17 and 18, 1970. 
(Requested by Activities Board).l
3. Finally, the freedom to de­
monstrate on the campus shall 
be limited to members of the 
campus community only.
Many people have asked 
what Carnegie-Mellon Univer­
sity will do if a demonstration on 
this campus were to occur that is 
not responsibly conducted and 
that is therefore disruptive. Ex­
cept under extreme conditions a 
subcommittee of the Policy Ad­
visory Board made up of mem­
bers of the Administration, Fac­
ulty and Student Body will be 
consulted on our actions. We shall 
attempt to deal with such a dis­
ruptive demonstration by internal 
means if at all possible. Our in­
ternal sanctions include proba­
tion, suspension, and explusion. In 
any University disciplinary action 
which might ensue, the constitu­
tional freedoms and rights of our 
students, including due process, 
will be maintained.
However, if it becomes evident 
that a disruptive demonstration 
cannot be dealt with internally, 
we shall have to seek outside 
aid, probably through the injunc­
tive processes of the courts. And if 
a demonstration becomes destruc­
tive of property or threatens 
life and limb, we may have to 
request immediate assistance from 
law enforcement officials out­
side the University.
We believe the most effec­
tive control is the responsible dis­
cussion we have been conduc­
ting on this campus, but we wish 
to assure all of our constituency 
that the integrity of the cam­
pus community is primary and 
that the normal functioning of 
the University must not be im­
paired.

LEITERS TO THE EDITOREditorial----
Registration Procedure - 
Needless Hassle
Although many of the registration problems this year 
were unavoidable due to the curriculum changes last semes­
ter and the subsequent elimination of preregistration, it is 
evident that the registration procedure needs to be revised.
Most departments are acting under the false assumption 
that the course content is more important to a student than 
the professor. This premise is false. If it were simply a case 
of subject matter, a student could easily, spend the three 
hours per week of classroom time reading the text books and 
learning the material in solitude. But the benefit of the col­
lege experience is the opportunity to learn from men who are 
experts in their particular area. Many students take a course 
in a subject they are not enthusiastic about simply because 
they respect the professor and wish to study under him.
It is therefore very disturbing to find students, especial­
ly seniors, who are being transferred from sections of a course 
they decided to take because of a particular professor into a 
newly created section which is being taught by a professor 
who is not well versed in the subject and who has not had 
time to adequately prepare for the course
To remedy this situation, seniors should be allowed to 
register first to guarantee that they will be able to sign up 
for the electives they desire. Then when a course is filled 
the class should be closed. Underclassmen should have the 
opportunity to take courses at a later date with the same prof­
essor, supposedly an expert in the field.
Other changes should be also considered by the regis­
trar’s office and departments. First, on the list of courses be­
ing offered the professor’s name should be specified. We can­
not ignore the fact that some professors are more popular 
than others and that some students want to avoid certain in­
structors. Students should be aware that if they are dissatis­
fied with the professor there is still the opportunity to drop 
the course or transfer sections. Departments should be more 
aware of the number of add-drops in certain classes. In 
this way, the department can evaluate the student’s opin­
ions of professors within their department.
Page 2—THE TARTAN—Tuesday, September 9, 1969
Another area of concern is the many curriculum and 
course requirement changes that have occurred throughout 
the University. Many students who entered C-MU as fresh­
men are finding that they must remain here several more 
years to complete requirements for the new curriculum. If 
requirements for a major are changed, a student should be 
able to choose whether he wishes to graduate under the old 
or new program.
To investigate these and other problems involved in 
the registration process, we recommend the registrar’s office 
establish a committee composed of representatives from all 
the departments and students. Only by coordinating the needs 
of all the colleges can a procedure be developed which will 
eliminate the hassles and headaches of September for ad­
ministrators, faculty and students.

C-Map Stands for Carmegie-Mellon Action Program
Black Students sit together on the steps out­
side Skibo and talk. They eat at the same exclu­
sive table. Now they live together on a Black floor 
They say they are happy with this arrangement, 
even though they didn’t request it. This is not 
surprising. The contentment of security 
in the known outweighs the risk of the unknown. 
The function of a university is not only to edu­
cate the students, but to broaden their experience. 
The consiousness of a white student is not expand­
ed by seeing a black student, buy by knowing 
him. C-Map governs the black students to the ex­
tent of giving them their room keys. Why are
they treated differently by the university that, in 
word at least, wants us to accept them as equals? 
One of the fraternities hung out a Confederate 
flag recently. People complained about that, yet they 
did not complain about the university that is 
figuratively sewing them. The university is carry­
ing this one step too far. We have had a pretend 
government, a pretend police force, and a pretend 
court. Now we have pretend integration.
It is often said that college is more than 
classes. We have black students in our classes. 
Why aren’t they in our college tooo?

Draft Resistor Awaits Decision
Dr. Michael J. Zigmond, a 1963 
graduatenof C.I.T. who faces 
trial for having refused induction 
into the Army, is now awaiting 
a decision from the U. S. Fed­
eral District Court in Boston, on 
his motion for dismissal of the 
case. He began legal proceed­
ings in April, 1969 to have his 
case dismissed on grounds that 
U. S. participation in the Viet 
Nam War is in violation of both 
international and domestic law 
and the “the Government cannot 
compel a citizen to support it in an
endeavor which violates interna­
tional law, as the Government 
would then be compelling a citi­
zen to participate in a crime.”
Zigmond, a research asso­
ciate at M.I.T.’s Department of 
Nutrition, returned his draft card 
in October, 1967 as a protest to 
U.S. involvement in Viet Nam. 
He was then declared delinquent 
by his draft board and ordered to 
report for induction in May, 1968, 
after his 26th birthday. He im-
mediately attempted to bring suit 
against the Selective Service 
System for violating his rights to 
due process of law both by us­
ing the draft as punishment for 
nonpossession of a draft card and 
by denying him a means of appeal­
ing or contesting the decision; 
however, no federal court would 
hear his case.
Zigmond then refused induc­
tion in May, 1968 and some 
months later began the legal 
proceedings which are now pend­
ing.
Volunteer Science Teachers Needed
September marks the begin­
ning of the second season of 
Special Teaching Projects, STP, 
in the Pittsburgh school district. 
This program was first develop­
ed to stimulate the interest 
and curiosity of junior high 
school students in science through 
classroom demonstrations and to 
give C-MU students classroom 
teaching experiemce.
The rationale behind the pro­
ject is that junior high school 
students may still be open to be­
ing motivated to pursue wider in­
terests and perhaps raise their 
educational goals.
The main tool for accomplish­
ing this project is the use of 
classroom science demonstra­
tions. Last year, STP used equip­
ment such as lasers, liquid ni­
trogen, stroboscopes, and the dis­
section of frogs for the demon­
strations. The content of each de­
monstration was left to the dis­
cretion of the student presenting 
it, with appropriate approval from 
the instructor of the class.
Any C-MU sophomore, junior,
senior or graduate student in 
engineering and science may 
volunteer for this project. An 
orientation session for all volun­
teers will be held late in Sep­
tember to give background on 
STP.
Interested students may sign 
up now for STP in the C-MU 
YMCA office, Room 57, Skibo. 
If you’re an interested college 
student who would like to help 
an unmotivated junior high 
school student and get involved, 
now is your chance!
