Scott Hall construction nears completion
BRIAN WALSH
News Editor
Students have probably 
noticed that the new frame of 
a building sprung out of the 
side of Wean Hall just beside 
Hamerschlag Hall last year. It 
is the new Sherman & Joyce 
Bowie Scott Hall, a building 
which is intended for use by 
the Biomedical Engineering 
Department, but also satis-
?es the needs of many other 
Carnegie Mellon students. 
Scott Hall was but a frame ly-
ing atop a few stilts just one 
year ago, but now it has blos-
somed. 
The building nears its full 
completion, scheduled for the 
spring of 2016.
Senior project manager 
Maxim Dorosa gave The Tar-
tan the opportunity to tour 
the nearly completed Scott 
hall two weeks ago. Workers 
were hard at work nearing the 
end of their shifts. 
Trucks traveled in and out 
of the underpass of the build-
ing, booming loudly over Do-
rosa’s voice as he provided us 
with the history of the con-
struction. “The real discus-
sions of building Scott Hall 
began about a decade ago,” 
Dorosa said.
“The administration didn’t 
know at ?rst where they want-
ed to put the new facility,” Do-
rosa said. The school consid-
ered several different options: 
the area by the power plant 
just across the railroad tracks, 
somewhere down by the hol-
low, or even locations off cam-
pus. They eventually decided 
upon the current location.
Once the decision was 
made, the administration 
put out a contest for several 
architects to compete for the 
opportunity to design the 
new building. “They took the 
current design from the two 
architects,” Dorosa said. “It 
properly incorporated the dif-
?culties of building on stilts, 
while providing enough space 
for administration and stu-
dents.”
Tepper Quad construction of?cially starts with ceremony
PATRICIA SILVERIO
Staffwriter
The Groundbreaking Cer-
emony for the Tepper Quad 
took place last Friday, signi-
fying the university’s aspira-
tion to expand and grow, both 
physically and metaphorically. 
In attendance were numerous 
Carnegie Mellon faculty mem-
bers, students, and investors, 
as well as other members of 
the community. 
This gathering celebrated 
the $201 million project that 
constitutes the largest infra-
structure expansion since the 
founding of the University in 
1900. With this expansion, 
the school intends to increase 
enrollment in the undergradu-
ate business program by 40 
percent and hopes to grow the 
master student population by 
50 percent.
The Tepper Quad is not just 
a building, “it embodies the 
distinctive academic vision of 
Carnegie Mellon,” remarked 
President Subra Suresh in his 
opening speech. 
This academic vision 
strives to bring together dif-
ferent disciplines in new and 
unique ways. The Quadrangle 
shares the same name as the 
Tepper School of Business, in 
honor of David A. Tepper, one 
of the University’s greatest 
living benefactors and great-
est contributor to this project, 
with a donation of $67 mil-
lion. However, it is not being 
built just for the Tepper School 
of Business, but for the entire 
campus community. 
In addition to housing the 
business school, the building 
will connect different parts 
of the Carnegie Mellon cam-
pus. The Tepper Quad will be 
home to several activity and 
communal spaces such as a 
new university welcome cen-
ter, the Swartz Center for 
Entrepreneurship, and new 
classrooms, dining facilities,

On Thursday, a discus-
sion regarding food insecu-
rity was held in the Student 
Government Conference 
Room in the Jared L. Cohon 
Center (CC). The discus-
sion invited Ann Sanders, 
the Volunteer Coordinator 
of Just Harvest, a non-pro?t 
organization dedicated to 
bringing about broad-scale 
change to combat the in-
justices that lead to hunger.
The discussion touched 
on problems of current 
policies to ?ght food inse-
curity. Sanders began by 
explaining what food secu-
rity is: access to adequate 
nutrition in normal ways. 
Sanders said despite 
measures which move 
to ?ght food insecurity 
on state and federal lev-
els, problems still persist.
Those who do not have 
access to the Internet have 
to go through about seventy 
pages of documentation to 
sign up for food assistance. 
Moreover, mistakes in appli-
cation procedures can result 
in application failure, so ap-
plicants have to “know the 
rules ahead of time,” Sand-
ers said. Sanders also said 
sometimes resources are so 
scarce that it takes hours to 
get food. This is time that 
one could spend working 
and increasing one’s income.
“We need to raise aware-
ness about how food insecuri-
ty impacts Carnegie Mellon,” 
James Crnkovich, a sopho-
more civil and environmental 
engineering major, said. He 
went on to say that Carnegie 
Mellon looked like an “isolat-
ed entity within Pittsburgh,” 
and that the university 
should take steps to integrate 
itself with the community.
The meeting was orga-
nized by Partners Allied in 
Civic Engagement (PACE), 
a student organization at 
Carnegie Mellon aimed at 
engaging students in civic 
duty and cultivating a com-
mitment to the service of the 
community. PACE focuses 
on issues of public concern 
like philanthropy, direct 
service, civic discourse, ac-
tivism, and social justice.
PACE runs a series of 
educational programs each 
year relating to a speci?c 
theme, and it chose to focus 
on food insecurity this year. 
PACE hopes to raise aware-
ness around food insecurity 
on campus and involve the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
in the issue. Event organizer

Orientation at the CMU 
Qatar campus is the liveliest 
time of the year. It’s the time 
when CMU Qatar restocks its 
supply of talented individuals 
and welcomes them to be part 
of the Tartan community.
A team of four Head 
Orientation Counselors 
(HOCs), ?ve Orientation 
Leaders (OLs), and 20 
Orientation Counselors 
(OCs) were recruited to 
welcome the newest members 
of our campus family. 
Over a ?ve month period, 
the HOCs worked hard to 
recruit the rest of the team, 
decide on an orientation 
theme, prepare a sched-
ule, and manage the logis-
tics of this week-long event.
The most signi?cant part 
of orientation planning is 
deciding on the theme. Each 
year, the orientation’s theme 
is based on concepts like su-
perheroes or pirates, and our 
entire campus is decorated 
accordingly. This year, the 
inspiration came from Dr. 
Seuss’ famous poem, and 
the HOCs chose the phrase, 
“Oh! The Places You’ll Go!” 
and turned the campus into 
Carnegie International Air-
port. Activities over the ?ve-
day period were designed 
to incorporate these aspects 
of the theme. The orienta-
tion team members were 
dressed as pilots, aviation 
of?cers, and ?ight crew.
The idea was to encour-
age the newcomers to dream 
big and to make sure they 
know that their fellow Tar-
tans are there to guide them 
through the process. Un-
der the CMU Qatar roof, we 
are all Tartans, bound for 
the same four-year journey.
As orientation week ap-
proached, the team took 
part in four days of train-
ing to prepare to welcome 
the new Tartans and engage 
them in a week of fun-?lled 
activities. The ?rst day of 
the week centered on the 
history of Carnegie Mellon, 
along with team building 
activities and informational 
sessions. Excitement picked 
up on the second day as 
freshmen in their respective 
orientation clusters chose 
a team name, painted their 
team ?ags, and played dodge 
ball with other clusters.
On day three, also known 
as Academic Day, the fresh-
men met with professors 
in their departments and 
learned about the various ac-
ademic resources available to 
them. On day four, students 
participated in more team 
building, went to a social 
with professors, and attend-
ed convocation for the Class 
of 2019. By the last day of ori-
entation, these new Tartans 
were part of the CMU Qatar 
family. Each orientation clus-
ter prepared short skits based 
on important values at CMU 
Qatar and ended the day 
with a ?nal dinner together.
Orientation has always 
played an integral part of 
the freshman experience. It 
allows the orientation team 
to give back to the commu-
nity by creating a smooth 
transition for the incoming 
Tartans. College is an im-
portant milestone in every 
individual’s life, and having 
a wonderful family to spend 
some of the most impor-
tant years of your life with 
makes this a very special ex-
perience. CMU Qatar is our 
home, and orientation gives 
us the chance to welcome 
people to it with open arms.

Senate brings students to Fall Fest in Legacy Plaza
DEBORAH CHU
Junior Staffwriter
This past Thursday night, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Undergrad-
uate Student Senate hosted its 
?rst Fall Fest at the brightly 
lit, recently renovated, Legacy 
Plaza. The air was crisp and 
breezy, characteristic of the 
fall spirit the event aimed to 
celebrate.
Music resonated through 
the plaza as a few students 
wandered around tables and 
were presented with offerings 
of free pumpkin and sugar 
cookies, popcorn, and stick-on 
tattoos, as well as free cider 
from Tazza D’Oro, a popular 
campus espresso shop. The 
atmosphere was nice and ca-
sual, meant to invite passing 
students to take a short break 
from their hectic workload 
to relax with free food and 
drinks.
In previous years, Senate 
would set up a table outside 
Doherty Hall in the fall and 
would hand out free cookies 
and cider from Tazza D’Oro, 
amidst throngs of students on 
their way to and from classes. 
This year, Senate upgraded 
this tradition into an actual 
event, citing both the potential 
for the event itself as well as 
for Legacy Plaza. Despite the 
elegant look and central loca-
tion of the plaza, it is still rela-
tively new and there is usually 
not much going on there, in 
terms of campus events.
As for Fall Fest, student 
life sets certain goals. Sen-
ate hopes that the future of 
the event may be to “partner 
with different organizations, 
have organizations come out 
and table with us too…and 
maybe something to look for-
ward to in the fall, a really big 
main event in the fall, like a 
‘fall-palooza,’ where we have 
people performing and things 
like that,” Campus Life Chair 
Kruti Koppolu said.
Fall Fest was organized 
by the Senate’s campus life 
committee, which focuses on 
boosting school spirit; other 
areas of focus this year include 
mental health and a program 
for faculty-student lunches. 
In the winter, Senate plans to 
organize trips downtown to 
Pittsburgh’s Light-Up Night, 
as well as to create Carnegie 
Mellon’s own version of Light-
Up Night on campus, by deco-
rating trees on the Cut with 
Christmas lights.
The fall-themed event 
was initially scheduled to be 
Wednesday night and was to 
feature a live performance 
from Rocki Boulis, a local 
Pittsburgh artist, but had to be 
moved to Thursday night due 
to rain.
The live performance was 
canceled since Boulis was un-
able to make it on Thursday. 
However, Fall Fest remained 
successful in what it aimed to 
do: provide a nice and relaxed 
fall atmosphere for students to 
drop by and enjoy delicious ci-
der and cookies.
HARVEST, from A1
“We brought Just Harvest 
in to talk because they focus 
on eliminating food insecu-
rity and hunger through ad-
vocacy and lobbying. They 
provide a broader perspec-
tive and highlight the un-
derlying causes of food inse-
curity,” Wolf-Sorokin said.
Just Harvest is a non-pro?t 
organization that focuses on 
hunger and poverty in Allegh-
eny County since its founding 
in 1986. Just Harvest believes 
hunger signals poverty caused 
by economic and political in-
justice. Just Harvest strives 
to change public policies to 
address hunger and poverty. 
In 2012, the organization 
renewed its organizational 
mission, vision statement, 
and core values in an up-
dated statement that empha-
sizes individual rights and 
responsibility in combating 
hunger. Just Harvest aims 
at guiding public opinion on 
the government’s effort in 
?ghting against hunger and 
poverty on the community 
level. Just Harvest includes 
two organizations, A Center 
for Action Against Hunger, 
its lobbying arm supported 
mainly by membership dues 
and grassroots fundrais-
ing activities, and Just Har-
vest Education Fund, its 
community education and 
outreach arm supported 
chie?y by grants, individual 
contributions, and grass-
roots fundraising activities. 
Just Harvest depends on 
volunteers and interns to op-
erate on a day-to-day basis. 
Sanders is the Volunteer Co-
ordinator of Just Harvest, in-
stalled in late 2011 after work-
ing for the organization for 
about four years. Sanders used 
to work in tax preparation 
and as a food stamp special-
ist. She acquired her Masters’ 
degrees in Social Work and 
International Development 
from the University of Pitts-
burgh in 2008. Sanders grew 
up receiving food stamps, so 
she is personally invested and 
devoted to ending hunger.
Food security is a systemic 
problem, Sanders said. Just 
Harvest intends to change the 
political fundamentals that 
result in hunger and poverty 
because it believes that food 
banks, homeless shelters, 
and other private charities 
are stop-gaps that should be 
accompanied by effective ef-
forts to eradicate hunger. 
Despite being the wealthi-
est country in the world, the 
United States has millions 
of Americans who are below 
the poverty line and hungry. 
Most people in poverty have 
been cornered by health, 
age, family circumstance, 
cultural barriers, inadequate 
education, or low-wage 
skills, which deprives them 
of their political and social 
voice because they have to 
focus solely on surviving in-
stead. These individuals are 
often forgotten by the public.
PACE is hosting future 
events regarding food inse-
curity. Stop Hunger Now is 
slated to be held on Saturday, 
Nov. 7 from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
in the Wiegand Gymnasium. 
A lunch discussion with Mim 
Seidel will be held in the 
CC Class of ’87 room from 
11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. PACE 
also prepares for the Thanks-
giving Basket Drive (an an-
nual event), held on Nov. 16.
Just Harvest has an up-
coming exhibition about 
poverty on Friday, Nov. 
6, 2015 from 6 p.m. to 8 
p.m. at 6022 Broad Street.

auditoriums, meeting spaces 
and a ?tness center. 
It will be connected to the 
Carnegie Museums and the 
University of Pittsburgh in an 
effort to work with the city 
and the county, extending the 
University’s impact beyond lo-
cal grounds and to the global 
community.
Kera Bartlett, President of 
the Graduate Business Admin-
istration, believes the Tepper 
Quadrangle will establish the 
space and invite the people 
necessary to “enhance [our] 
education by shifting the 
mindset of being students ac-
customed to their own sepa-
rate building on the corner of 
campus, to being at the center 
of a crossroads, for incredible 
discoveries and interdisciplin-
ary learning.” A Carnegie 
Mellon student at the event 
highlighted the cross-campus 
collaboration trend seen in 
graduate level campus groups, 
such as the Idea Marketplace, 
and interdisciplinary compe-
titions, such as Hack-a-start-
up, which will keep evolving 
thanks to the new building and 
the opportunities it provides.
David A. Tepper also spoke 
at the event about his vision 
for the building: a vision for 
education. The construction 
of the Tepper Quadrangle is 
Carnegie Mellon’s way of “not 
just talking the talk, but walk-
ing the walk.” The initiatives 
this new construction allows, 
like the Swartz Center for 
Entrepreneurship, are meant 
to reach beyond university 
grounds and transform the 
region, with the support of 
other partners, like Google 
or Apple, that will build upon 
this investment. Tepper hopes 
that all departments of the 
school can interact with each 
other and work with alumni to 
create and develop new ideas. 
He believes the proximity of 
two great schools, Carnegie 
Mellon University and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, will give 
Pittsburgh a unique possibil-
ity to create something very 
different in learning.
However, the construc-
tion of the building has raised 
some sustainability questions 
as students notice trees being 
torn down to make way for 
the construction. Measures 
are being taken in an effort 
to mitigate this and create a 
net positive impact. The Tep-
per Quadrangle complies 
with LEED Gold Certi?cation 
standards, based off of ?ve 
building performance stan-
dards, including sustainable 
site developments, water sav-
ings, energy ef?ciency, ma-
terials selection and indoor 
environmental quality. The 
?oors will be constructed with 
lighter materials in an effort 
to reduce the amount of effort 
required to heat and cool the 
building over time. Addition-
ally, the placement of hollow 
plastic balls, made from re-
cycled materials, between two 
reinforcing steel layers within 
the concrete eliminates excess 
use of concrete and allows for 
longer structural spans, reduc-
ing the amount of beams and 
columns overall. 
The Tepper Quadrangle 
will be built on a 4.5-acre 
space on the existing More-
wood parking lot at the in-
tersection of Morewood and 
Forbes Avenues. 
The lead architects in 
the project are Moore Ruble 
Yudell Architects & Planners. 
The Tepper Quadrangle will 
of?cially open in 2018.

Student Body President J.R. Marshall updates campus
Dear Campus Community,
It is truly hard to believe 
that the halfway mark on this 
semester has already come 
and gone. The leaves are fall-
ing, the wind is getting brisk 
and everyone seems to be en-
trenched in the busy discourse 
of classes and activities.
Perhaps it’s how busy we 
are. Our tendency for busi-
ness might explain why the 
time seems to pass so quickly 
at Carnegie Mellon. In these 
short eight weeks, our student 
government has executed an 
enormous body of work: Fri-
day night lights, pizza and 
politics, a student governance 
town hall, a performance by 
Kai Roberts on mental health, 
a student faculty mixer, a stu-
dent-parent luncheon, and so 
many other events and pro-
gramming. These represent 
our eagerness to engage you, 
the student body, in the gov-
ernance process as much as 
we can.
More events and more 
chances to get involved are 
coming your way in the next 
eight weeks. Also, Jibby and I 
will be getting out onto cam-
pus on Fridays to table and 
meet with you to hear what 
you think about the job we’re 
doing. We might not meet all 
13,000 members of our stu-
dent body, but each voice and 
perspective is crucial for us to 
be successful.
Due to the incredible en-
thusiasm and service of ev-
ery member of our cabinet, 
the governing bodies, and 
the student body at large, we 
have been able to be success-
ful in carrying out the events 
and pursuing the goals we set 
out to accomplish last spring. 
However, as we progress 
through the year, your partici-
pation, feedback and opinion 
will only become more im-
portant. I encourage you to 
participate in the future town 
halls we will host for the stu-
dent body, reach out to Jibby 
and me at any time, and utilize 
your representatives in Senate 
and GSA as your advocates 
and friends.
We will continue to do our 
best to bring the student gov-
ernment and all it has to offer 
to every member of our stu-
dent community. Tell us how 
we’re doing, get involved in 
our projects, and let’s contin-
ue to pursue a better tomor-
row for all of Carnegie Mellon. 
Together.

The current location pro-
vides a unique opportunity 
for the school. “This building 
will connect previously un-
connected parts of the school. 
We have the intersection of 
Wean, Hamerschlag, and Rob-
erts Hall,” Dorosa said. On the 
third ?oor, a common area 
with an open skylight will con-
nect all these areas in a single 
intersection, the Rougi Atri-
um, also known as the Cross-
roads. Underneath the build-
ing, an underpass connects 
Hamerschlag and Wean’s 
south face to the Gates Hill-
man Complex via a walkway 
large enough to accommodate 
service vehicles. These con-
nections exist as a testament 
to the building’s ability to ful-
?ll a need for more space and 
greater cross-campus connec-
tivity.
Right next to the Rougi 
Atrium, engineering students 
will get access to an all-new 
state-of-the-art clean room fa-
cility. “The clean room that a 
lot of the engineers currently 
use is from way back in the 
’70s,” Dorosa said. The con-
struction crew contemplated 
where to put the clean room 
for a while, but chose the lo-
cation just by the intersection 
because of its structural stabil-
ity and wide-open space.
The process of building 
in the chosen area does not 
come without its dif?culties, 
though. “An often-overlooked 
beauty of building construc-
tion is all the science that goes 
on behind the scenes,” Dorosa 
said.
 Walking through the base-
ment of the construction, The 
Tartan saw the computer regu-
lating systems of the building, 
the new cooling and heating 
systems, and the foundations 
of the building up close. Cool-
ing ?red up for the ?rst time 
earlier that day, and the com-
puters worked at a warm tem-
perature of 32 degrees Celsius 
— about 90 degrees Fahren-
heit.
These undercover systems 
run through the entire build-
ing all the way to the top, 
where The Tartan had the 
unique opportunity of walk-
ing on the roof of the building. 
Looking in, Scott Hall main-
tains its own sort of aesthetic: 
a mark on Carnegie Mellon’s 
diverse architecture. How-
ever, it cannot be argued that 
the views from Scott Hall are 
hard to beat on campus. The 
Cathedral of Learning sits on 
directly out of the building’s 
west face, with a presence so 
large that a viewer could feel 
as if they were eating lunch on 
the lawn just beside The Porch 
restaurant.
On the ?fth ?oor of the 
building, a large conference 
room provides a 180 degree 
view of the surrounding Oak-
land area. The conference 
room shows how Scott Hall 
ful?lls its primary purpose: 
giving the administration of 
the Biomedical Engineering 
Department its own home 
base, and further expansion of 
its engineering programs.
Another thing that people 
looking at the construction 
would not grasp immediately 
is the impact of the railroad on 
the construction of the build-
ing. Reverberations of the 
passing railcars could be felt in 
certain parts of the building. 
Most of the impact of a passing 
train, though, is picked up and 
handled by building’s stilts.
In fact, the stresses that the 
stilts face is an area of interest 
for associate professor of civil 
and environmental engineer-
ing Mario Berges. Berges and 
his research team put sensors 
on the stilts to pick up the dif-
ferent stress variables. The 
building sees teams of workers 
traf?cking the area from 6:30 
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. daily, and 
sometimes even later.
When asked what he ?nds 
most beautiful about Scott 
Hall, Dorosa said that he al-
ways ?nds the behind the 
scenes work the most intrigu-
ing and wonderful. “The stu-
dents and faculty sit in the 
building, comfortable not just 
because of how pretty it is, but 
because of all the chemistry, 
and the engineering, and the 
facility work that goes into 
making the place comfort-
able,” Dorosa said.
The new Scott Hall certain-
ly has an aesthetic beauty to it, 
and the vision of the architects 
will soon be realized as the 
?nishing touches are put on 
the interior and inner work-
ings of the new building. And 
just maybe, students will have 
a respect for the undercover 
work that went in to making 
the building what it is.

NavCog app from CMU, IBM maps the world for the blind 
JULIA NAPOLITANO
Assistant SciTech Editor
Researchers from Carnegie 
Mellon University teamed up 
with IBM to create the ?rst 
open platform for a smart-
phone app to assist the blind 
navigate their surroundings.
The app, called NavCog, 
primarily works on the Carn-
egie Mellon campus. It uses 
existing smartphone sensors 
and Bluetooth beacons to in-
form the blind of their sur-
roundings through ear buds or 
smartphone vibrations.
“When in an unfamiliar 
place, people tend to use a 
walking navigation system on 
their device to compare the 
map location to the surround-
ing views,” NavCog’s website 
explains. “However, visually 
impaired people cannot check 
the map or the surrounding 
scenery to bridge the gap be-
tween the ground truth and 
the rough GPS location. 
“NavCog aims for an im-
proved high-accuracy walking 
navigation system that uses 
BLE beacons together with 
various kinds of sensors with a 
new localization algorithm for 
both indoors and outdoors.”
NavCog is currently avail-
able online and will be down-
loadable on the App Store 
soon. IBM Bluemix has also 
made the cognitive assistant 
tools available through a cloud 
for developers. 
These tools include a navi-
gation app, a map editing tool, 
and localization algorithms to 
help the blind identify where 
they are and what direction 
they are facing.
Chieko Asakawa, an IBM 
Fellow and distinguished ser-
vice professor in Carnegie 
Mellon’s Robotics Institute, 
headed the project.
“While visually impaired 
people like myself have be-
come independent online, we 
are still challenged in the real 
world. To gain further inde-
pendence and help improve 
the quality of life, ubiquitous 
connectivity across indoor 
and outdoor environments 
is necessary,” Asakawa said 
in a university press release. 
“I’m excited that this open 
platform will help accelerate 
the advancement of cognitive 
assistance research by giving 
developers opportunities to 
build various accessibility ap-
plications and test non-tradi-
tional technologies such as ul-
trasonic and advanced inertial 
sensors to assist navigation.”
NavCog is a product emerg-
ing from the research ?eld of 
cognitive assistance, which 
utilizes smart machine tech-
nology to assist people in ev-
eryday life. 
Researchers from the 
Carnegie Mellon University 
Cognitive Assistance Labora-
tory collaborated with IBM 
Research to explore the use of 
localization technologies, sen-
sors, and computer vision to 
identify objects and people to 
assist with people’s declining 
cognitive abilities. Although 
the app currently only works 
on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, 
the researchers are optimistic, 
and hope to work with others 
to implement this technology 
in other locations.
Martial Hebert, the direc-
tor of the Robotics Institute, 
commented on NavCog, say-
ing that “from localization 
information to understanding 
of objects, we have been creat-
ing technologies to make the 
real-world environment more 
accessible for everyone. 
With our long history of 
developing technologies for 
humans and robots that will 
complement humans’ missing 
abilities to sense the surround-
ing world, this open platform 
will help expand the horizon 
for global collaboration to 
open up the new real-world 
accessibility era for the blind 
in the near future.”
According to NavCog’s 
website, “NavCog aims to 
achieve a higher accuracy 
localization so that in the fu-
ture, it will be able to provide 
a more precise description of 
surrounding Point of Interests 
and environmental informa-
tion to the users based on their 
current location.” 
While this new technology 
represents a major step for-
ward in assisting those who 
are visually impaired, the re-
search team hopes to continue 
pushing the boundaries. 
In the future, they hope to 
develop versions of the app 
that can detect approaching 
individuals as well as their 
moods.
Should sentences depend on statistics?
THATCHER MONTGOMERY
Staffwriter
At last week’s Pugwash 
meeting, we discussed the use 
of statistics in the criminal jus-
tice system. Inspiration for the 
topic was drawn both from 
the science ?ction movie Mi-
nority Report, in which crimes 
are predicted before they even 
happen and would-be crimi-
nals are jailed before they 
commit the act, and from re-
allife, as a proposed Pennsyl-
vania law aims to determine 
probabilities of criminals re-
offending and adjust prison 
sentences accordingly.
One of the ?rst things that 
came up in the discussion 
were the reasons for jailing 
people in the ?rst place. First 
is the idea of retribution: If 
one person sees another doing 
something wrong, he would 
presumably want to punish 
the perpetrator and make him 
pay for it. Second is the idea 
of incarceration: by taking 
dangerous individuals out of 
society, society as a whole will 
be better off. Finally, there’s 
the idea of rehabilitation: tak-
ing people who made wrong 
choices and teaching them 
how to function in society so 
they can return as function-
ing, productive members to 
society.
An initial thought was that 
the use of statistics would 
make the criminal system 
more objective. Instead of 
being at the whim of a human 
jury or judge, who may hold 
biases, or be having bad days 
and make poor judgements, 
sentencing would be done in 
the same manner for every-
one, by the same algorithm. 
Wouldn’t it be more fair?
However, some questions 
about statistics came up. How 
can we trust the current sta-
tistics that would be used to 
build the models to determine 
probabilities of re-offense? 
It would be easy to look at 
the current situation and say 
that certain races just com-
mit more crimes than others, 
when there are really many 
more factors at play. The cur-
rent system is biased, and so 
basing statistical models off 
the current system would just 
carry those biases forward.
Countering those con-
cerns was the idea that if we 
know what the biases are, we 
can work to correct them and 
come up with a better system. 
However, even if the model 
itself isn’t biased, the police 
doing the legwork, looking for 
crime may be biased.
That was one idea that 
resurfaced throughout the 
conversation. Couldn’t using 
statistics to determine who is 
more likely to commit a crime 
and then incarcerating him or 
her end in a downward spiral? 
Suppose the model says black 
men are more likely to com-
mit crimes, and so therefore 
we round up all the “high risk” 
black men and imprison them. 
Wouldn’t this be something of 
a self-ful?lling prophecy?
Similarly, if we’re using 
statistics to root out the sup-
posedly worst parts of society, 
wouldn’t it make sense to use 
the same model to determine 
who will be the least likely to 
commit crime and produce 
positive effects on society, and 
then prop those chosen ones 
up? Just by thinking about it, 
one can see how the self-ful-
?lling prophecy is something 
to be avoided.
Also of concern was the 
idea that by handing off all the 
work to a statistical model, we 
would be rejecting the idea of 
free will. Although an individ-
ual may be at high risk of com-
mitting crimes, it is ultimately 
up to that individual whether 
or not he commits a crime. 
Instead of just throwing them 
in jail, wouldn’t it be better to 
encourage them to make bet-
ter choices?
This is the key question 
Pugwash was asking about 
the need for prisons. Is it 
merely to protect society? If it 
is, it would just be best to take 
people with a high probability 
of criminality and toss them in 
jail to protect innocent civil-
ians. But if the idea behind jail 
is criminal rehabilitation, then 
the statistical models could be 
used for a better purpose.
Instead of jailing high-risk 
individuals, resources could 
instead be used to help under-
stand their situation and why 
they would commit a crime, 
and then help move them

Neurons involved in itch separate from those in pain
Researchers from the Salk 
Institute for Biological Stud-
ies discovered a neural path-
way involving neuropeptide 
Y (NPY) neurons dedicated to 
transmitting non-chemically 
induced itches, de?ned as tin-
gling sensations caused by a 
light touch. In collaboration 
with the Dana-Farber Cancer 
Institute, the researchers de-
termined the function of neu-
ropeptide Y (NPY) neurons by 
removing them from the spinal 
cord of mice and performed 
experiments in which they si-
lenced the genes that expressed 
the NPY neurons. To their sur-
prise, they found that the mice 
without NPY neurons were no 
more sensitive to chemically-
induced itch, itch caused by 
a healing mosquito bite or 
wound on the skin, or pain, 
even through their sensitivity 
to light touch had increased. 
The study suggests that the spi-
nal neurons involved in an itch 
differ from those that cause 
pain and chemical itch. In the 
future, these ?ndings could 
help researchers modify neu-
rons to treat patients who suf-
fer from chronic itch.

New class of DNA enzyme repair is discovered
A new class of DNA repair 
enzyme, called AlkD, has been 
discovered by researchers 
from Vanderbilt University of 
California, Davis, and Toyama 
Prefectural University. Found 
in soil-dwelling bacteria that 
cause a certain kind of food poi-
soning, AlkD binds to DNA that 
is damaged by environmental 
factors such as ultraviolet light. 
This binding causes conforma-
tional changes in the DNA that 
enable the removal of a dam-
aged base, a building block of 
DNA, in order to make room for 
a new, undamaged base.
AlkD was previously 
thought to belong to a class of 
enzymes known as DNA glyco-
sylase which remove damaged 
DNA bases through a process 
known as base-excision repair. 
The new discoveries by these 
researchers broadens the scope 
of DNA repair mechanisms, 
and suggests that there could 
be many more mechanisms 
than previously thought. Infor-
mation about these new mech-
anisms could potentially lead 
to new treatment options for a 
variety of diseases, including 
cancer.

Dolphins suspected in whale attack off the coast of Skye
Last week, a severely in-
jured, three-year-old pilot 
whale was euthanized after 
being found in Dunvegan, a 
small town on the Isle of Skye 
in Scotland. 
The whale had teeth marks 
on its body, ?ippers, and dor-
sal ?n, wounds that are rarely 
found along the coasts of the 
United Kingdom. Marine of-
?cials suspect that bottlenose 
dolphins were the culprit of 
the injuries. The of?cials are 
not sure whether the injuries 
arose from the whale playing 
with or being attacked by the 
bottlenose dolphins.
Scottish waters are home 
to the most northerly popu-
lation of bottlenose dolphins 
in the world, and interactions 
between dolphins and whales 
are an integral part of their 
natural behavior. There has 
only been one previous inci-
dent of a dolphin attacking 
a whale in the United King-
dom. The incident serves as a 
reminder to those who come 
in contact with dolphins 
that while they are generally 
friendly, they do possess a 
potentially aggressive nature.

New arti?cial skin feels texture and hears sound
The world’s ?rst arti?cial 
?ngerprints have been de-
signed by researchers at Ulsan 
National Institute of Science 
and Technology and Dong-A 
University, which are both lo-
cated in South Korea. The sci-
entists created electronic skin 
that incorporates ?ngerprint-
like grooves on the surface to 
mimic real ?ngertips.
The arti?cial skin is made 
of layers of plastic and gra-
phene material that are ?ex-
ible and sensitive toward 
external stimuli. Through 
?uctuations in electric cur-
rent the skin can detect subtle 
changes in temperature and 
pressure. Furthermore, it 
can detect noises even better 
than a microphone of a smart-
phone. The study was pub-
lished in the journal Science 
Advances.
The scientists hope to con-
tinue this research in order 
to ?nd a way to relay signals 
from the electronic skin to the 
brain. They hope that the skin 
will ultimately serve as the ba-
sis for more comfortable and 
ef?cient prosthetics, wearable 
devices, and hearing aids.

Probes unveil three hidden blemishes on the moon
In a recent publication of 
the journal Science Advances, 
researchers presented evi-
dence that reveals three pre-
viously unseen blemishes 
on the surface of the moon. 
Back in 2011, scientists 
at the National Aeronau-
tics and Space Administra-
tion (NASA) launched twin 
probes from the Gravity Re-
covery and Interior Labora-
tory (GRAIL). The GRAIL 
mission, which went on until 
2012, gave the scientists a 
better understanding of the 
circular dents on the moon’s 
surface caused by impact cra-
ters. With the data collected 
from the gravitational pulls 
on the two spacecrafts, the 
scientists were able to ?nd 
evidence for the existence of 
three basins named Asperi-
tatis, Bartels-Voskresenskiy, 
and Copernicus-H. 
The size and distribution 
of these basins goes against 
the idea that four billion 
years ago space rocks hit the 
Earth and moon, which is a 
common suggestion for the 
eradication of early life on 
Earth.

Facebook replaces Other inbox with message requests
Facebook has announced 
that in the next few days it 
will be making changes to 
its Messenger service by get-
ting rid of the Other inbox, 
similar to a spam folder, in 
which users receive messages 
from people that they are not 
friends with on the site. The 
Other inbox, which many 
Facebook users either are 
not aware of or don’t check, 
will be replaced by a message 
request system in which a 
user receives these messages 
directly in their inbox and 
has to either accept or reject 
them. 
While the new request 
service will enable to users 
to message virtually anyone 
on the social network and 
ensure that their message 
is seen, there have been in-
creased concerns about the 
decreased privacy associated 
with the service. Many orga-
nizations and page admins, 
however, are embracing the 
new format because it will 
likely increase the amount of 
users they are able to contact.

PUGWASHNew packaging developed at CMU 
for drug delivery
JOSH BROWN
Staffwriter
Modern medicine can do 
some amazing things. From 
shocking hearts back into 
rhythm to eradicating disease 
altogether, medicine seems to 
be a ?eld of ever-growing pos-
sibility. However, when con-
sidering diseases such as can-
cer, where the enemy is not a 
foreign invader but the body’s 
own tissues, effective treat-
ments require a little more 
engineering, which is where 
targeted drug delivery comes 
into play.
Targeted drug delivery is a 
very complicated process, es-
pecially in the case of cancer, 
where it is dif?cult to distin-
guish between mutated cells 
and healthy ones. Cells receive 
stimulation from the outside 
environment via receptor 
proteins located in their mem-
branes. There are no cancer-
cell-speci?c receptors, which 
in an ideal situation could be 
used to effectively treat cancer 
cells. This makes it dif?cult to 
speci?cally target cancer cells 
with medication and leave 
the healthy cells untouched. 
Many drugs tend to interfere 
with the parts of a cell crucial 
for division, which also means 
that they will target the cells 
that tend to divide more 
quickly — hair, skin, and bits 
of the digestive system. This 
is one reason why smart drug 
delivery is being researched 
— to stop wrongfully killing 
healthy cells.
There are still many large 
questions surrounding this 
treatment method, including 
how to get drug molecules 
into cells and how to differen-
tiate between healthy and dis-
eased cells. While some fac-
tors are not quite set in stone, 
researchers from Carnegie 
Mellon University, the Colo-
rado School of Mines, Golden, 
and U.C. Davis have partnered 
to tackle a relatively more 
concrete project: engineering 
the structure of the “packag-
es” within which drugs would 
be contained — liposomes.
Liposomes are the struc-
tures that surround the drug 
and carry it through the body. 
Liposomes are made up of 
phospholipids, the same mol-
ecules that make up a cell’s 
membrane. They are an im-
portant factor in the viability 
of targeted drug delivery be-
cause they have to be struc-
turally sound; if they are not, 
doctors run the risk of having 
them burst inside patients, 
spilling their destructive con-
tents in the body and leading 
to internal damage.
This project was a multi-
scaled study, meaning that 
three different teams tar-
geted the problem from 
three different microscope

Downloading Consciousness: a BrainHub panel discussion
JOSH BROWN
Asst. Copy Manager
On Thursday afternoon, 
members of the Center for 
the Neural Basis of Cognition 
(CNBC) assembled to present a 
panel discussion regarding the 
relationship between computer 
science, neuroscience, and the 
connection between the brain’s 
circuitry and consciousness.
The panel was composed of 
Carnegie Mellon faculty from 
multiple departments. The 
panel, mediated by professor 
of biological sciences and inter-
im director of BrainHub Alison 
Barth, included Carnegie Mel-
lon faculty coming from the 
Departments of Computer Sci-
ence, Neuroscience and Biolog-
ical Sciences, and Philosophy. 
The attendees were Sandra 
Kuhlman, assistant professor 
in the Department of Biologi-
cal Sciences; Wayne Wu, an as-
sistant professor and Associate 
Director of the CNBC; David 
Touretzky, research professor 
for the computer science de-
partment and the CNBC; and 
Anind Dey, a faculty member 
in the Department of Human 
Computer Interaction.
In the words of Dr. Barth, 
the central question the dis-
cussion revolved around was, 
“How close are we to being 
able to represent the human 
consciousness in computers?”
Kuhlman began the panel 
by speaking about the brain’s 
complexity. After listing some 
of the ways in which this com-
plexity manifests, she noted 
her doubt toward the idea of 
neuroscientists fully under-
standing the brain within her 
lifetime, stating that she is 
more interested in “developing 
strategies for understanding 
the brain” than she is in pursu-
ing a complete understanding.
Next, Wu discussed a paper 
which examined the idea of 
hearing a sound to understand 
consciousness; some brain 
activity was observed when 
the subject was introduced 
to sound but did not actively 
“hear” it, and brain activity was 
widespread when the subject 
heard the sound, or was con-
scious of it. In this way, Wu 
summarized that not all brain 
activity “gives rise to mental-
ity,” which adds another dif?-
culty to the already aggressive 
list.
Wu went on to discuss the 
idea of downloading con-
sciousness, of mirroring the 
brain’s circuitry and attempt-
ing to replicated consciousness 
in a computer. He admitted 
that “there are already prob-
lems connecting the brain to 
the mind, so there would be 
many more issues in connect-
ing the brain to computational 
systems.” As it now stands, 
there is no clear sign for a bio-
logical basis for consciousness, 
no explanatory connection be-
tween intelligence and the cir-
cuitry of the brain.
Wu brought up the idea of 
Turing’s Test, in which a hu-
man (A), and a computer (B) 
are asked questions by an im-
partial party (C); based on the 
questions and their answers, 
C determines which one is hu-
man. If C has to guess, then 
this is considered proof of an 
arti?cial consciousness’s legiti-
macy. This idea was applied to 
constructions such as Watson, 
IBM’s arti?cial intelligence 
who beat actual human play-
ers at Jeopardy, SimSensei, a 
virtual therapist, and Chatbot 
programs which simulate con-
versation in text. The argument 
is that arti?cial intelligence is 
more than the ability to cre-
ate a dialogue; some programs 
can do this by reiterating the 
question originally asked, or 
in Watson’s case, by answering 
correctly. These sorts of virtual 
consciousnesses are the clos-
est we can currently come to a 
truly arti?cial intelligence, but 
they appear to be on the right 
track.
The conversation gradually 
shifted from the creation of ar-
ti?cial intelligence in comput-
ers to the possibility of trans-
ferring a human consciousness 
into a computer. The panelists 
focused on a case in which a 
doctor of neuroscience devel-
oped a brain tumor and elected 
to preserve her brain so that in 
the future, there would be po-
tential for her consciousness 
to be replicated in a computer 
so that she and her boyfriend 
could talk after she passed 
away. The panelists agreed 
that there are many issues with 
cryopreservation and this over-
all situation. There is the issue 
of natural cell death and the 
tissue death that comes from 
freezing, and since we do not 
currently have a concrete con-
nection between the brain and 
the mind, it would be a long 
while before anything like this 
would even be plausible. Also, 
there is the fact that were they 
to reconstruct her brain, they 
would be reconstructing a hay-
wire brain — a tumored brain 
— to consider.
Dey talked about work 
being done by the University 
of Southern California, where 
researchers are attempting to 
preserve the consciousness 
of a Holocaust survivor. They 
recorded him with multiple 
cameras in order to produce a 
3D hologram construction of 
his body. When he speaks, he 
mimics the normal physical 
patterns of human speech very 
well. The hologram is a reposi-
tory of information, much like 
a human intelligence: One can 
ask him a question, and he will 
reply by combining many facts 
about himself and respond-
ing in a very human way. This 
seemed to be the most inter-
esting push toward a real con-
sciousness within a computer 
out of all of the examples.
The underlying thread be-
neath these two examples is 
that there is still no clear con-
nection between the mind 
and the brain — between con-
sciousness and circuitry. The 
most dif?cult task, the panel 
agreed, would be to recreate 
a speci?c consciousness and 
have it recognizable by a loved 
one. 
As of now, it is far easier to 
replicate a simple emotion or 
a person you’ve never met be-
fore. Recreating a speci?c con-
sciousness brings up the ques-
tion: just because a program 
can think like a person, or has 
the same wiring and circuit ac-
tivity, is that program then that 
person? Do they need access 
to that person’s memories to 
truly replicate that conscious-
ness? Is a simple replication 
of the circuitry enough, or is 
there something more, some-
thing intangible about the indi-
vidual that makes this concept 
of downloading consciousness 
unproductive? Right now, 
there are more questions than 
answers.

away from that situation and 
mindset. For example, crimi-
nals who performed crimes 
of necessity are entirely from 
poorer populations, and are 
at more risk of re-offending 
as well. But no matter how 
much they get thrown into 
jail, they’ll still re-offend 
because they need whatever 
they’re stealing to survive. 
So instead of jailing them, 
maybe they should be target-
ed with assistance. The sta-
tistical models could be used 
to ?nd high-risk offenders 
and then work with them to 
remove the causes of crime.
This would require more 
than just the introduction 
of statistics into sentenc-
ing, however. It would be an 
entire shift in the mindset 
of the American criminal 
justice system. And while 
Pugwash mostly compared 
incarceration to rehabilita-
tion in terms of bene?t to 
society, many Americans still 
hold tight to the idea of retri-
bution: jail is punishment for 
bad acts, and should be met-
ed out because criminals de-
serve it, regardless of any ex-
isting alternative methods.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational orga-
nization that discusses the 
implications of science. This 
article is a summary of last 
week’s discussion on the use of 
statistics in the criminal jus-
tice system.
PREDICTION, from A5Pugwash talks crime
resolutions. The resolution 
determines the properties 
and science considered by the 
particular team — will they 
look at the liposome’s struc-
ture at a magni?cation which 
privileges chemistry (atomic/
molecular levels), or will they 
take a coarser look and privi-
lege physical properties?
The Carnegie Mellon re-
searchers, led by Professor 
Markus Deserno of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Physics Department 
and Dr. Mingyang Hu, a PhD 
candidate in computational 
biophysics, focused on the 
structure at a coarse level. 
This means that they 
looked at the problem from a 
physical perspective, applying 
the study of physics to their 
computational models and ex-
aminations. 
They started out with a hub 
and spoke model, the same de-
sign as an old carriage wheel: 
the drug molecule in the cen-
ter, polymeric tethers which 
would bind to the drug as the 
supportive spokes, and the 
phospholipids which would 
comprise the surrounding lay-
er, or the wheel itself.
The team concerned them-
selves with the pragmatics of 
liposome creation, since one of 
the overarching goals of their 
research is to produce the lipo-
somes for clinical use. 
They focused on the lipo-
some’s dispersity, or the uni-
formity of the system, and, 
according to Deserno, “how 
uniform does it have to be not 
to disperse, in order to work?” 
The results were encourag-
ing enough that production 
would not be prohibitively 
expensive, and the system will 
hold just ?ne in theory. 
The team was also con-
cerned with the production 
process’ role in creating lipo-
somes. 
For simple liposomes 
without the structural design 
necessary for carrying drug 
molecules, Deserno said that 
“[their size] depends on the 
production process. But this 
isn’t the case with our struc-
ture. The size of the liposome 
is dictated by the physics. It’s 
the choice of design parame-
ters, like how many polymers, 
how long they are, et cetera.” 
This means that the theo-
retical structure is much more 
easily producible, good news 
for those who would actually 
construct them.
“I’m the guy at Amazon 
who packages things nicely 
so they don’t get broken,” said 
Deserno.
The researchers developed 
a theoretical, robust package 
for drug delivery. 
Deserno maintained that 
while the ?ndings were “pure 
theory and computational 
study,” the theories should be 
sound enough that when an-
other lab attempts to produce 
the liposomes using these 
blueprints, it should work 
swimmingly.

Recently, the citizens of 
Mexico unexpectedly found 
themselves in the direct path 
of Hurricane Patricia, which 
is being lauded as the most 
intense tropical cyclone even 
recorded in the Western Hemi-
sphere. Meteorologists ?rst ac-
knowledged Patricia as a tropi-
cal depression, but it quickly 
grew from a tropic storm to a 
Category 5 hurricane within 
the span of 24 hours. Hurri-
canes can be amazingly pow-
erful and destructive forces of 
nature, and they can grow at 
terrifying and unpredictable 
rates.
On Oct. 23, Patricia made 
landfall and luckily was not 
nearly as destructive as ini-
tially expected. Still, its rapid 
growth has mysti?ed me-
teorologists. Despite having a 
fundamental understanding 
of how hurricanes form, they 
cannot fully explain Patricia’s 
growth.
Hurricanes generally form 
over warm ocean waters near 
the equator because the warm, 
moist air rises upward from the 
surface. Simultaneously, the 
space left void by the rising air 
is ?lled with the surrounding 
cooler air. The warm moist air 
forms into clouds, generating a 
powerful machine-like system 
that continues to grow as the 
wind spins and the storm feeds 
on warm air. 
Storms formed north of the 
equator spin counterclockwise 
while those that form south of 
the equator spin clockwise.
The center of the hurricane, 
commonly known as the eye, 
forms as the storm system be-
gins to pick up speed. 
A Category 5 hurricane 
like Patricia produces wind 
speeds up to and over 155 
mph, though Patricia earned 
the title of the strongest Paci?c 
wind system ever observed, 
with wind speeds of 200 mph. 
Meteorologists described 
Patricia’s development into 
a Category 5 hurricane as a 
result of a perfect environ-
ment for rapid intensi?cation. 
During its formation, there 
was a consistent cycle of heat 
exchange and a large drop in 
pressure, optimal conditions 
for hurricane formation.
Wind shear, also known as 
a wind gradient, results from 
quickly changing speeds and 
direction of wind and usu-
ally acts as a brake to slow the 
growth of the hurricane. Un-
fortunately, wind shear was 
very weak during Patricia’s for-
mation, and this largely con-
tributed to its rapid growth.
Luckily, the strength of the 
storm subsided, and damage 
was not as serious as initially 
expected. Still, Hurricane Pa-
tricia will continue to be re-
garded as a very interesting 
phenomenon and a dangerous 
natural disaster by meteorolo-
gists and citizens alike.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Brutal police of?cers don’t belong in public schools 
From pre-kindergarten onwards, 
many public school students see po-
lice of?cers almost every day. Wheth-
er it’s in Drug Abuse Resistance Edu-
cation (DARE), in an assembly, or 
just in the halls, police of?cers are a 
signi?cant presence in school. 
School police of?cers serve many 
purposes: They teach students about 
drug resistance, help prevent vio-
lence in schools, and often serve as 
friendly faces. Sometimes, however, 
school police of?cers are the ones 
causing violence in public schools — 
last week, a video surfaced online of 
a school police of?cer in Columbia, 
South Carolina ?ipping over a stu-
dent’s desk and throwing her to the 
ground. 
Although some claim the of?cer’s 
actions were justi?ed — the student 
had refused to leave the classroom 
before the of?cer struck her — noth-
ing short of a gun in the classroom 
justi?es such violence against a high 
school student. 
The of?cer, a white man, has gar-
nered well-deserved condemnation 
from proponents of the Black Lives 
Matter movement for his violence 
against the black student, and has 
since been ?red from his position at 
the school. 
As police of?cers become com-
monplace in schools, they bring into 
the classroom tactics used to ?ght 
crime in the streets. School police of-
?cers are becoming ?gures of intimi-
dation, rather than the role models 
they’re intended to be. 
With police of?cers stationed in 
schools, wayward students follow a 
pipeline straight from high school to 
prison, contributing to an over?lled, 
ineffective, and ultimately broken 
prison system. Although school 
police of?cers are supposed to be 
trained in defensive discipline, the 
video shows that such training is not 
always effective. 
The cons of having police of?cers 
in our schools outweigh the pros. 
We must rethink a system that keeps 
high school students in line with bru-
tality, and replace it with one based 
on more constructive disciplinary 
tactics. 
Meat is not healthy, government subsidies force us to keep eating
SINEAD FOLEY
Staffwriter
The World Health Organization 
(WHO) report released on Monday 
should give pause to everyone on 
campus with a dining plan. From 
Resnik to the Underground, red and 
processed meats are ubiquitous, and 
the recent WHO report ties these 
foods to an increased risk for sev-
eral types of cancer. The report ties 
the daily consumption of at least 50 
grams of processed meat to an 18 
percent increased risk of colorectal 
cancer.
Campus is not the only place 
where such processed meat is in 
abundance and even excess. In 
2012, the average American con-
sumed 54 grams of processed meat 
per day, putting her at an elevated 
risk. This report highlights the need 
for change in how Americans think 
about and use meat, as well as how 
the government subsidizes the meat 
industry.
First, let’s break the report down: 
It’s written by the International 
Agency of Research into Cancer 
(IARC), the branch of the WHO that 
specializes in cancer research. The 
IARC classi?es correlates for cancer 
into ?ve groups: carcinogenic, prob-
able carcinogenic, possible carcino-
genic, unclassi?able, and probably 
not carcinogenic. To be classi?ed as 
carcinogenic, a substance must be 
proven to cause cancer in human 
subjects, while a probable carcino-
genic substance only requires strong 
support in animal test groups.
The report placed processed 
meat in the carcinogenic group and 
red meat in the probable carcino-
genic group. It also announced the 
18 percent increase in risk tied to 
processed meats and tied 34,000 
cancer deaths per year to processed 
meat consumption. Most people 
know that hot dogs aren’t a health 
food, but the category of processed 
meat includes anything that has 
been salted, cured, fermented, or 
otherwise altered. This translates to 
sausages, bacon, jerky, lunch-meats, 
and more.
Americans eat almost three times 
more meat than the global average, 
and much of that is either red or pro-
cessed. One of the reasons Ameri-
cans eat so much more meat is that 
it’s amazingly cheap and plentiful in 
this country. Meat prices should be 
through the roof with the high de-
mand, but farm subsidies help keep 
the cost down.
The United States Department 
of Agriculture spends around $20 
billion annually on agricultural 
subsidies. The vast majority of that 
money goes to corn and soy. These 
crops are integral to many people’s 
diets — us vegetarians are practi-
cally made of tofu — but most of the 
yield goes to meat. In 2014, 5.3 bil-
lion bushels of corn went to animal 
feed, compared to the 1.4 billion 
that went directly to humans. The 
government is practically picking up 
the tab for the meat industry.
In contrast, fruit and vegetable 
farmers get almost no support. Spe-
cialty crops, de?ned by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture as “fruits and 
vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, 
horticulture, and nursery crops,” 
are actually ineligible for both of the 
major subsidy programs. Without 
government support, produce is sig-
ni?cantly more expensive to grow 
and therefore to buy. The farm sub-
sidy system locks Americans into a 
strange parallel universe from most 
of the world by making meat is the 
cheaper alternative.
The WHO report is just another 
voice in the chorus proclaiming the 
detrimental affects of high-meat 
diets. The American Cancer Soci-
ety has long touted the bene?ts of 
limiting processed meat. Even the 
American government itself has ad-
mitted that it is important to eat a 
diet skewed away from meat, recom-
mending a healthy meal that’s half 
fruit and veggies and one-?fth meat.
Yet even while paying lip service 
to the medical community, the gov-
ernment continues to economically 
promote excessive meat consump-
tion. The WHO report should serve 
as a reminder that the farm sub-
sidy program needs to be reevalu-
ated if America wants a healthier 
population.
What does this all mean for us on 
campus? There’s an idea in Ameri-
can culture that a meal is not com-
plete without a meat component, 
but the science is showing that that 
might not be the best idea. So next 
time you’re ordering pancakes at the 
Carnegie Mellon Café, maybe opt 
for the veggie sausage as a side — I 
promise it doesn’t bite.Criminal record not death sentence for employment
Earlier this week, New York 
passed “ban the box” legislation, 
which removes a checkbox on job 
applications requiring candidates to 
disclose their criminal background. 
This legislation plays a key role in eq-
uitable employment opportunities. 
By merely having applicants check 
a box on a form, employers are mis-
understanding the nature of crime 
in a way that unfairly disadvantages 
people.
The ?rst problem with simple 
check boxes is that many crimes are 
crimes of necessity. There is much 
context involved in crimes, many of 
which are related to socioeconomic 
status. If a person’s family is desti-
tute and selling drugs is the only way 
for them to put food on the table, he 
or she should not be permanently 
out of a job. 
Even though the person did break 
the law, they did so largely due to 
poverty. Putting them in a position 
that permanently excludes them 
from the economy is the exact op-
posite of a meaningful solution. It 
creates the cyclical poverty that con-
demns families to lives of hardship 
for generations.
This problem is exacerbated by 
the rising income inequality in the 
American economy. After the 2008 
?nancial crisis, the recovery has 
taken the form of an upward redis-
tribution of wealth for a variety of 
reasons. 
As wealth is concentrated within 
a small number of people, the mon-
ey that people do have simply has 
less purchasing power because the 
wealthiest contingent of society has 
a much higher price at which they 
will buy goods. 
Further, wages have stagnated for 
about 15 years. With higher prices 
and less money for the working poor, 
the economy is not producing the 
kinds of jobs that allow people to suf-
?ciently provide for themselves. This 
means more people are in positions 
where crimes are not only realistic 
but, well, necessary.
The second problem with check 
boxes is that they rest on two as-
sumptions, both of which are in-
tuitively false. The ?rst assumption 
is that arrests are representative 
of who is committing crimes. The 
second assumption is that people 
who are convicted are always guilty 
and people who are not convicted of 
crimes are always innocent. 
The binary nature of a checkbox 
requires these assumptions to be 
generally true. The racial and ethnic 
biases of law enforcement, trials, and 
sentencing are all well documented. 
This means that Black and Hispanic 
applicants will be more likely to ac-
tually have to check the box than a 
white person who has committed the 
same crimes. 
This economic discrimination is 
unconstitutional but, more impor-
tantly, simply wrong. A job grants 
someone access to resources, and 
it allows someone to participate in 
the economy. That right should al-
ways be independent of immutable 
characteristics like race or bad luck 
like the struggling post-recession 
economy.
The Tartan applauds New York 
City for recognizing the issues with 
check boxes to indicate a criminal re-
cord on job applications and encour-
ages other states to pursue similar 
measures in the future.

NYC’s new free SAT plan transcends class limitations
The Tartan Board recently pub-
lished a commentary on a study from 
the University of Washington which 
revealed that in the 50 most popu-
lated American cities, less than one 
third of high school students take 
either the SAT or ACT. This indicates 
the disturbing in?uence that class 
and race have on access to educa-
tion, and therefore a well-paying job, 
in America.  
This week, however, New York 
City took an encouraging step to-
ward bridging this gap. Beginning in 
spring 2017, city public schools will 
offer the SAT for free to high school 
juniors during the school day. Nor-
mally the test occurs on weekends in 
variable locations and costs $54.50.
Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña 
announced the change on Monday 
to kick off College Application Week, 
a national program that encourages 
students to apply to college by offer-
ing them the chance to speak with 
admissions of?cers and receive free 
advice on application essays. Once 
the program is implemented, it will 
not be mandatory to take the exams, 
but giving students the opportunity 
to do so in a comfortable atmosphere 
at no cost will break down a barrier 
that stands in many students’ ways to 
higher education.
By making the test the default, 
participation will increase for stu-
dents who would not otherwise 
choose to spend the money and the 
Saturday morning on it. But then, by 
already ful?lling a requirement for 
many college applications, higher 
education may seem more realistic 
— especially for students who don’t 
expect to earn a degree. Some insti-
tutions offer scholarships based on 
performance, which could ease the 
?nancial burden even further.
This program is only expected to 
cost New York City an annual $1.8 
million per year, which is barely a 
penny in the grand scheme of the 
city’s budget of $75 billion. We hope 
that other cities in America will fol-
low New York’s lead and implement 
similar programs in their public 
schools. If they succeed, an encour-
aging next step would be to offer free 
or reduced-price SAT preparation 
classes to help students maximize 
their potential.

Rise Up October protests show world has apathy problem
NECATI ALP MUYESSER
Junior Staffwriter
New Yorkers rarely seem inter-
ested in what’s going on. This makes 
locals fairly easy to pinpoint: they 
walk around with “I’ve seen it all” at-
titudes. Snobbish, yes, but also quite 
well founded. I personally know New 
Yorkers who would not give a sec-
ond glance to a naked person walk-
ing down the street. New Yorkers 
are truly a hard-to-surprise breed. 
So I wasn’t utterly shocked when I 
witnessed a rather unremarkable 
case of civil unrest in Times Square 
last weekend: the Rise Up October 
protests.
I stopped to take a good look any-
ways. I don’t wish to belittle the Black 
Lives Matter movement, and quite to 
the contrary, I am sympathetic to the 
cause of ?ghting police brutality and 
mass incarceration. But I also don’t 
want to misrepresent the incident 
as something more than it actually 
was. The police contained it after a 
short-lived brawl and few media out-
lets ended up giving the protesters 
coverage.
I might not be a New Yorker, but 
I am an Istanbulite, a person who is 
equally if not more used to seeing 
crazy stuff happen right in front of 
their eyes. Two years ago, I happened 
to be in Taksim Square during the 
Turkish Gezi Park protests, a nation-
wide condemnation of the ruling 
party that sprang from plans to build 
a shopping mall in one of the few ur-
ban green-zones in Istanbul. Though 
the dynamics of the two movements 
are not identical, both include fac-
tors such as police brutality and the 
oppression of ethic minorities that 
have led to direct action by frustrated 
masses.
No matter how unique a social 
movement appears to be, I believe 
that the plea for social change all 
across the globe is centered around 
the same themes: liberty, human 
rights, and equality. As a proponent 
of the Gezi Park movement, I could 
relate to protesters in New York de-
manding equal treatment from law 
enforcement of?cials. Unfortunately, 
I could also relate when a peaceful 
gathering intended to protest police 
brutality ironically ended with more 
police brutality. When I sensed that 
tensions were growing, my journal-
ist’s instincts took over, and I ap-
proached the protesters. I know that 
transparency means little these days, 
but I began to record anyways. I saw 
protesters getting kicked by cops as 
they laid defenseless on the ground. 
I heard people shout that they would 
not commit suicide under police cus-
tody, bringing attention to suspicious 
deaths of detainees such as Sandra 
Bland. But by far the most tragic 
thing I witnessed was people taking 
sel?es with such chaos in the back-
ground, grinning ear-to-ear.
My home country is as polarized 
as it gets. The massive support tha-
texisted for the Gezi Park was greeted 
with an equally sizable opposition. 
That pretty much sums up Turkish 
politics: We either stand together in 
solidarity or we ?ercely dissent. But 
at least we usually care enough to dis-
sent. When people are so indifferent 
to the issues of their fellow citizens 
that they treat their demands for jus-
tice as petty Snapchat stories, we’ve 
reach a whole new level of low.
This is not an American issue; 
the growth of apoliticism is global. 
People everywhere are losing their 
ability to empathize. As technology 
permeates culture more and more, 
personal communication suffers. 
When we fail to communicate, we 
withdraw into our little bubbles. As 
our bubbles shrink, so do our comfort 
zones. Instead of confronting deeply 
entrenched political issues such as 
racial segregation and Islamophobia, 
we pretend that they do not exist.
Ignoring social movements that 
demand racial equality can be con-
venient and comforting. But indif-
ference will make neither the move-
ments nor the problems go away. 
History has shown this repeatedly. 
We need to engage. We need to pay 
Black Lives Matter the attention it 
deserves.
“Ferguson Effect” is myth, distraction from real movement 
SARAH BENDER
Junior Staffwriter
In a speech at the University of 
Chicago Law School, Federal Bureau 
of Investigation (FBI) Director James 
Comey stated that he believes the 
“Ferguson Effect” is responsible for 
an increase in crime in cities across 
America.
According to the  New York Times, 
the number of murders as of August 
has increased in many major cities. 
Milwaukee, for example, has seen a 
76 percent increase, from 59 murders 
in 2014 to 104 in 2015. Murder rates 
have increased by 60 percent in St. 
Louis, 56 percent in Baltimore, and 
22 percent in New Orleans.
In Comey’s opinion, one that is 
shared by several other law enforce-
ment of?cials, this is at least partially 
due to the demands of Black Lives 
Matter protesters. He speculated that 
an increase in public scrutiny of po-
lice behavior after the fatal shooting 
of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Fer-
guson, Mo. has resulted in more hesi-
tant policing.
 According to Comey, police of-
?cers are increasingly reluctant to 
take action for fear of becoming the 
source for the newest hashtag or You-
Tube video condemning overzealous 
and downright unconstitutional po-
lice actions.
Other government of?cials, in-
cluding White House Press Secretary 
Josh Earnest, have countered that 
there is no evidence of a relationship 
between the protests and the current 
rise in crime. Numerous other causes 
have been suggested, from lowered 
gun prices to a rise in synthetic drugs 
to more people being released from 
prison.
True or not, Comey’s claim could 
just be his attempt to oversimplify a 
complicated issue and point ?ngers. 
But if the Ferguson Effect is, as The 
Atlantic proclaimed, nothing more 
than the “bigfoot of American crimi-
nal justice,” it is unsettling to see 
powerful people jumping to lay the 
blame for increased violence on so-
cial activists without any proof.
Combined with Comey’s use of 
the phrase “all lives matter,” thought 
by many to undermine the Black 
Lives Matter movement, it seems evi-
dent that he intends to merely bully 
those speaking out and return to a 
state where people turn a blind eye to 
police injustice. 
Even if there were any evidence 
to support the Ferguson Effect, that 
would mean that police of?cers ?nd 
themselves unable to properly do 
their jobs when there is a risk they 
may be ?lmed and held accountable 
for their actions.
If there is truly a trend develop-
ing where police are taking a hands-
off approach thanks to the increased 
presence of civilian vigilance and 
recording devices, that means they 
feel that they can’t keep people safe 
without simultaneously disrespect-
ing people’s civil rights. They know 
their misbehavior would not be sup-
ported under scrutiny, and yet they 
would rather do nothing than adjust 
their actions to comply with the law.
Black Lives Matter protesters are 
either viewed as a convenient scape-
goat or an excuse to delay changing 
police behavior. Over a year after the 
shooting in Ferguson, it has again be-
come clear that the issues brought to 
light that day have not disappeared. 
But if efforts to bring about reform 
are treated as almost criminal them-
selves, it may not be practical to ex-
pect things to change signi?cantly 
anytime soon.

Every year, public schools across 
the United States experience a dras-
tic change from their day-to-day 
activities. Teachers hand out thick 
packets of multiple choice questions, 
students ?ll out an excess of bubble 
sheets, and parents get bombarded 
with emails reminding them to make 
sure that their children get lots of 
rest and make it to school on time. 
School administrators lose sleep over 
national and state performance level 
standards. 
Normal curricula are suspended, 
and attention is instead turned to 
state-mandated reading comprehen-
sion questions, basic math equations, 
and canned essay formats. Entire 
schools are turned upside down, 
and it is all thanks to standardized 
testing.
Standardized testing has been a 
part of American education since the 
mid 1800s. However, its use in pub-
lic schools skyrocketed when the No 
Child Left Behind Act (2002) intro-
duced the ?rst nationwide annual 
standardized testing requirement for 
children from grades 3–8. The Coun-
cil of Great City Schools estimates 
that students in public schools take, 
on average, 112 standardized tests 
during their school careers, accord-
ing to a report released last month. 
This translates to roughly eight tests 
per student every year from pre-kin-
dergarden until 12th grade, many 
of which have been mandated by No 
Child Left Behind.
This rampant use of standardized 
testing is meant to increase and hold 
schools accountable for student per-
formance. However, National Assess-
ment for Education Progress, a set 
of federally sponsored exams that is 
administered consistently across all 
50 states, released its newest report 
last week, showing a decrease in the 
math scores of fourth and eighth-
graders, the ?rst decline since 1990. 
Increasing standardized testing, it 
appears, is not the key to improving 
the American education system.
President Obama seems to agree. 
The Department of Education’s new 
Testing Action Plan promises to pro-
vide guidance and funding to help 
reduce testing. In an open letter 
to America’s teachers and parents, 
Obama states his three basic prin-
ciples that any test used in the class-
room should meet: “First, our kids 
should only take tests that are worth 
taking — tests that are high qual-
ity, aimed at good instruction, and 
make sure everyone is on track. Sec-
ond, tests shouldn’t occupy too much 
classroom time, or crowd out teach-
ing and learning. And third, tests 
should be just one source of informa-
tion. We should use classroom work, 
surveys, and other factors to give us 
an all-around look at how our stu-
dents and schools are doing.”
Under the Testing Action Plan, any 
test that doesn’t meet these standards 
will be eliminated. Furthermore, 
schools will only be allowed to spend 
a maximum of 2 percent of classroom 
time on standardized testing.
This critical view of standardized 
testing as a whole is a much-needed 
development in American education. 
Our schools’ reliance on standard-
ized testing is extremely limiting, 
forcing teachers to halt the momen-
tum of their classes, sti?e their cre-
ativity, and teach in a manner that 
might not be the most effective for 
their students.
Many times, teachers feel pres-
sure from school administrations to 
“teach to the test” in an effort to raise 
school averages and thereby increase 
federal funding. Putting teachers in 
a box signi?cantly lessens what stu-
dents learn. A class taught with the 
goal of preparing for a standardized 
test is a class taught with no real-
world context. There is little oppor-
tunity for students to be creative and 
take deeper meaning from their les-
sons when everything can be summa-
rized in a state-issued test. Teaching 
to a test is not teaching students how 
solve problems, it is not encouraging 
students to inquire further into the 
course material, and it is not teaching 
students how to internalize methods 
of learning effectively.
Furthermore, the prevalence of 
standardized testing creates a serious 
disparity between students that are 
good at it and those that are not. Just 
like any other method of learning 
and any other method of assessment, 
standardized testing is not built for 
every student. 
When it is emphasized so much 
more than other methods of learn-
ing and assessment, it alienates the 
multitude of intelligent, motivated 
students who may not be as success-
ful in the standardized testing model 
as in other assessment models. On 
the other hand, students who are ad-
ept at the standardized testing model 
should not be taught to solely rely on 
those skills, as very little real-world 
problem solving involves a by-the-
book multiple-choice test.
President Obama is on the right 
path in his efforts to reduce standard-
ized testing. That is not to say that the 
Testing Action Plan will solve all of 
our problems regarding standardized 
testing. Even 2 percent equates to 
approximately 23.4 hours of testing 
every year, and the three guidelines 
to what will make a standardized test 
acceptable are still very vague. But it 
is a step in the right direction and a 
step toward an education system that 
is more effective and accurate in both 
teaching and assessing all types of 
students.
Students aren’t standard, too many tests impair learning

Letter to the Editor: Israel actions in Palestine justi?ed, reasonable
For those of you unaware, there 
has been a recent outbreak of vio-
lence between Palestinians and Is-
raelis over false accusations from 
Palestinian leadership. 
Namely, they have claimed that 
Muslims may not be the only ones al-
lowed to pray at the Temple Mount 
in the future. In addition, the Oslo 
Accords, which set the ground for 
peace under former president Bill 
Clinton’s administration, were de-
nounced by Mahmoud Abbas, the 
leader of the Palestinian Authority in 
the West Bank.
Furthermore, on Palestinian tele-
vision, Abbas welcomed the spilled 
blood of Palestinians in Jerusalem 
as the blood of martyrs. An op-ed 
recently published by The Tartan, 
“America must not fund oppression 
of Palestine,” discusses the recent 
tensions and suggests that the terror-
ism being perpetrated is understand-
able given the plight of the Palestin-
ian people. 
The author also argues Israel’s 
response has been grossly dispropor-
tionate. But what can Israel do when 
four children, all fewer than 10 years 
old, witness the murder of their par-
ents, or a father is murdered, and 
his wife and two-year-old child are 
attacked?
The only answer is to defend 
themselves as they have done for 
decades as the State of Israel, and 
for millennia as the Jewish People. 
Hamas, the internationally recog-
nized terrorist group that controls 
the Gaza Strip, as well as Fatah, the 
political and militant party in charge 
of the West Bank, called for a “Day of 
Rage,” inciting Palestinians to attack 
innocent Jews on the street. 
Palestinians committed arson at 
Joseph’s Tomb and a bus depot in Ra-
mat Gan, a neighborhood of Tel Aviv 
where I used to work. A couple weeks 
ago, two Palestinians armed with a 
gun and a knife attacked a bus full 
of innocent Israelis, killing one and 
injuring several others, and a mother 
and her children were badly burned 
in a ?rebomb attack last week.
Despite this violence, Israel has 
practiced restraint in its response. 
There has been no incursion into the 
West Bank, no disruption of services 
or aid to the Gaza Strip or West Bank, 
no airstrikes, and no military action 
other than increased patrols in Je-
rusalem and other major cities. Yet 
there is still more terror, and more 
innocent blood spilled.
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip 
and the West Bank indeed live under 
terrible conditions. But the attacks 
that are being planned and carried 
out will only make their conditions 
worse; innocent Palestinians will be 
placed in further danger due to the 
actions of the terrorists that live and 
plot among them. The only solution 
is a peaceful one.
When I lived and worked in Tel 
Aviv in the summer of 2014, Hamas 
launched hundreds of rockets and 
thousands of mortar shells toward 
major population areas and border 
towns of the Gaza Strip, including 
Tel Aviv. 
Israel invested in counter-terrorist 
measures such as the Iron Dome mis-
sile defense system and bomb shel-
ters that made me feel safe enough to 
stay in a country under attack. Israel 
invests its money, time, and resourc-
es into protecting everyone that lives 
within its borders.
Meanwhile, Hamas in the Gaza 
Strip and terrorist factions in the 
West Bank invest their money, time, 
and resources into attacking Israel 
while using United Nations schools, 
hospitals, and innocent civilians as 
shields. Israel will do everything it 
can, including aborting air strikes 
targeting terrorist leaders, to mini-
mize collateral damage and prevent 
the loss of innocent lives.
If you truly want to support the 
Palestinians in their plight, then you 
cannot support the organizations 
that hurt the people they suppos-
edly protect. Support the search for 
peace; engage in a peaceful conver-
sation rather than a shouting match. 
Let us come together and see each 
other as humans, without hate, with-
out prejudice, with a single goal of 
living together peacefully.
There is a passage in the Jeru-
salem Talmud: “Whoever destroys 
a soul, it is considered as if he de-
stroyed an entire world. And whoev-
er saves a life, it is considered as if he 
saved an entire world.” As Jews, we 
value the life of every person. Even 
if a person has so much hate in their 
heart that they seek to kill us, their 
life still matters. Israel trains its secu-
rity forces to wound, and not to kill 
unless absolutely necessary.
Israel has shown great patience 
and restraint in dealing with con-
stant threats of terrorism. It is a 
marvel that Israel is still willing to 
negotiate a peace agreement despite 
this. All we ask is that the other side 
is willing to come to the table where 
life is valued more than hate. I fear 
this may be in the very distant fu-
ture, and until then, I shall mourn 
the needless loss of innocent Pales-
tinians and Israelis thrown away in 
favor of hate.
I will continue to pray that there 
may be a peaceful solution, that Is-
raelis and Palestinians can live to-
gether without fear, without hate, 
without violence, and ?nally live in 
peace.

Don’t see red, Youtube pay-wall bene?ts us all
XIYU WANG
Last week, YouTube launched its 
ad-free subscription service: You-
Tube Red. As with any change that 
rolls around, YouTube Red has had 
its critics. 
The majority of the criticism re-
volves around how, in the face of ad 
blocking, paying $10 a month for 
YouTube is a waste of money. Fur-
thermore, there have been concerns 
over the steps YouTube seems to be 
taking to make its creators pay, as 
evidenced by an 16,000 signature 
petition on Change.org, “Stop You-
Tube Red”.
To the ?rst point, YouTube Red 
may be of interest to people who 
want to support content creators 
or the platform itself. As popular 
YouTuber and multimillionaire 
Pewdiepie points out on his blog, ad 
blockers signi?cantly cut into the ad 
revenues of creators; an estimated 
40 percent of ad revenue may be lost 
due to ad blocking, which can signif-
icantly hurt smaller channels.
There have been many creators 
on YouTube who have asked their 
viewers to turn off ad-blockers when 
viewing their content. Personally, 
I would rather tip a creator I sup-
ported through Patreon than turn 
on ads. In my experience, ads signi?-
cantly increase the time a webpage 
takes to load, diminish the viewing 
experience, and sometimes even 
contain malicious code. 
An of?cial ad-free solution that 
helps support content creators 
would be useful, but it is clear that 
YouTube Red cannot survive on the 
selling point of an ad-free viewing 
experience alone.
For one thing, a large portion of 
YouTube’s user base is young and 
may not be as willing or able to pay 
a subscription fee. Compared to Net-
?ix, for example, most of the content 
on YouTube seems to be geared to-
ward an under-30 crowd — think 
Tyler Oakley versus House of Cards. 
Furthermore, the majority of videos 
on YouTube are amateur content 
that most people would rather not 
see if they had to pay money for 
it. Red may be of the most use for 
people who use YouTube to listen to 
music, but this service is hardly any 
different from the existing Google 
Play Music subscription, which is 
now bundled with YouTube Red.
To entice anyone into using You-
Tube Red, YouTube plans to rely on 
“premium” content: high-budget 
videos by some of its biggest stars 
available only to Red subscribers. 
It appears that YouTube is trying to 
change the direction of how it does 
business.
 Instead of a platform where 
people are able to post and discuss 
videos, YouTube may be trying to 
become a content distributor, able 
to hold leverage over the decisions 
of its creators and shift the balance 
of who rightfully owns content.
Many are concerned about how 
YouTube handles its power over 
its partners and whether they will 
maintain the culture of open con-
tent. In launching YouTube Red, 
YouTube partners were given the 
option to either sign up for YouTube 
Red or let their videos be made pri-
vate, which would make their videos 
inaccessible to the general public. 
While most partners had no qualms 
about the switch, YouTube got its 
way by essentially threatening them 
with censorship.
Although it remains to be seen 
what direction the platform will 
head in, for now YouTube Red seems 
to be overall a net positive for cre-
ators and users. Hopefully, YouTube 
will continue to support the efforts 
of creators and improve the experi-
ence of users without sacri?cing its 
traditional culture of open content.

ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
The Buffalo Bills had lots 
of good feelings surrounding 
them this offseason. They had 
just ?nished one of the best 
defensive years by a team in 
recent memory, they hired 
Rex Ryan — considered by 
some the best defensive mind 
in football — to make that 
defense even better, and with 
wide receiver Sammy Watkins 
and running back LeSean Mc-
Coy, the team could be a force 
coming into this season.
After an opening-week win 
against a listless Colts team, 
that vision has not exactly 
panned out. With a horren-
dous loss to the Jaguars, the 
Bills now stand at 3–4 and 
don’t look anything like the 
team they set out to be. So 
what went wrong?
The easiest answer is a 
tough schedule. The Bills 
have played two undefeated 
opponents to this point (the 
Patriots and Bengals) and are 
3–2 against teams comprised 
of mortals. They even hung 
with both of those undefeat-
ed teams until late. That still 
does not look great when the 
Bills eked out a win against 
the hapless Titans and lost to 
the Giants in their only other 
matchup against a team over 
.500. The Bills should be do-
ing much better against the 
bad teams they have faced if 
they think of themselves as a 
playoff contender.
The second easy place to 
look is injuries. Watkins, Mc-
Coy, quarterback Tyrod Tay-
lor, and others have missed 
signi?cant time over the open-
ing couple months of the sea-
son. However, this explana-
tion also seems insuf?cient. 
With the exception of defen-
sive tackle Kyle Williams, the 
injuries have largely been to 
the offense, which has been 
honestly pretty good despite 
the lack of experience at 
quarterback and the coach’s 
defensive bent. While backup 
quarterback EJ Manuel basi-
cally single-handedly lost the 
game to the Jaguars, it seems 
this team’s problems go a bit 
deeper than injuries.
The third obvious expla-
nation is the Bills’ penalties. 
Penalties hurt, but the Patriots 
and Seahawks are consistent-
ly among the league’s most 
penalized teams, and they do 
plenty of winning. This, com-
bined with the previous two, 
will certainly cause problems 
for a team, but it seems that 
the Bills have some more fun-
damental issues.
The root of this team’s 
problems seems to come, 
more than anything, from a 
disconnect between personnel 
and scheme. Rex Ryan runs 
a 3–4 defense, putting three 
lineman and four linebackers 
near the line of scrimmage. He 
then runs a two-gap system 
where the defensive line’s job 
is to contain the pocket.
There are some problems 
with the Bills running this de-
fense. Defensive tackle Marcel 
Dareus is among the best play-
ers in football, but his arms 
are not quite long enough to 
contain both A-gaps (the spac-
es between the center and the 
guards). This allows the cen-
ter or the guard to seal off one 
of those gaps, creating both 
running and throwing lanes.
Further, defensive end Ma-
rio Williams is athletic and is 
best at wreaking havoc in the 
back?eld. He has faded into 
the background when con-
taining his side, which is fur-
ther hurting the Bills’ defen-
sive efforts.
The Bills have tried some 
interesting schematic changes 
in order to combat this. The 
?rst change came against 
the Bengals. The Bills would 
stack the line of scrimmage, 
showing blitz, and then bail 
into coverage. This confused 
Bengals quarterback Andy 
Dalton a bit and kept the Bills 
in the game until the waning 
moments. The problem was, 
the gimmick wore off after a 
while and Dalton got better 
at ?guring out which blitzes 
were real. Further, Williams 
and other players did not like 
dropping back in coverage, so 
the scheme was unsustainable 
with the players.
The second change came 
against the Jaguars. Ryan 
changed from a two-gap to a 
one-gap defense, empower-
ing his defensive line to go all 
out after the quarterback and 
continuing his method of hav-
ing the defense show pressure 
and occasionally bail. This 
tortured Jaguars quarterback 
Blake Bortles, who spent most 
of the game being woefully 
ineffective. Despite the team 
losing that game, the defense 
actually worked quite well. 
Of the 34 points they gave 
up, two came on defensive 
touchdowns, and one came 
on an absolute prayer thrown 
from an off balance Bortles 
that happened to fall into the 
?ailing arms of Jaguars wide 
receiver Allen Hurns. The Bills 
lost multiple goal line posses-
sions to a fumble and a (bo-
gus) penalty, so really, they 
were the better football team. 
The problem was Manuel 
throwing the ball to the Jag-
uars when he wasn’t just drop-
ping it on the ground for them 
to return.
This change to a one-gap 
system could, if the offense 
gets back on track, help right 
the ship for the Bills. Ryan 
showed in his ?rst two years 
with the Jets that he could 
squeeze an elite defense out 
of solid players, he should cer-
tainly make something out of 
decent players.
With McCoy and Watkins 
getting healthier and only one 
game separating the Bills from 
the sixth seed, this team will 
probably make the playoffs, 
but if the defensive schemes 
keep ignoring their players, 
even one of the league’s best 
coaches with some of the 
league’s best players will have 
trouble.

Last week’s match-up is 
still a little hard for me to 
talk about. I’m going to keep 
matters brief to minimize the 
pain. It was bad. I was on the 
losing side of a 101–72 match-
up.
LeGarrette Blount rushed 
for negative three yards and 
earned zero points. The Jets 
D/ST allowed 30 points and 
almost 400 yards, raking in a 
whopping one point. And it 
gets worse.
Team Escamilla had Matt 
Stafford with 18 points, Mar-
shawn Lynch with 18, Todd 
Gurley with 27, and the St. 
Louis D/ST with 21. These 
four players alone scored 
more than my entire team. 
But wait. There’s more.
I had the Giants D/ST 
on my bench, because why 
would I start them? And then, 
they caught three intercep-
tions, returned one for a 
touchdown, recovered a fum-
ble, and returned a kickoff 
for a touchdown. All this for 
16 points. Also on my bench, 
Nate Washington received 
for 127 yards and scored two 
touchdowns, amounting to 
24 points. Had I started them 
both, I could have won 107-
101. But I’m not bitter.
Going into this week, the 
projections had me defeating 
Team Sizzling Fajitas 87-75, 
but of course projections nev-
er hold. But just after Thurs-
day Night Football, things are 
looking a little different. We 
both have Patriots running 
backs, which is kind of weird 
to me. Unfortunately, his Dion 
Lewis just saw more action 
than my LeGarrette Blount.
I expect to lose the match-
up at quarterback, too. Even 
though Russell Wilson and 
the Seahawks are pretty 
much universally expected 
to beat the Cowboys, it looks 
like Alex Smith and the Chiefs 
will come out on top of the 
Detroit Lions in their London 
match. Detroit is basically a 
total mess, they’ve had a lot 
of staf?ng changes recently. 
Plus Charcandrick West is 
pretty hot right now, and he 
and Smith have some good 
chemistry.
The past couple of weeks 
have been a little disappoint-
ing as a Le’Veon Bell owner. 
He scored eight against the 
Cardinals and 13 against the 
Chiefs, which is not what I ex-
pect from a number-one draft 
pick. This week, Pittsburgh 
faces the Cincinnati Bengals, 
who have been on a serious 
winning streak. I don’t feel 
like I can count on him to live 
up to his 16 point projection, 
even though he has historical-
ly done pretty well against the 
Bengals. Still, he’s matched 
up against Frank Gore of the 
Colts, who averages about 
nine points per game. Even 
though I’m reserving opti-
mism for Bell, I think I have 
this match up.
At wide receiver I’m start-
ing Decker and Washington. 
Unfortunately Pierre Garcon 
has a bye week, so I don’t have 
any other options. Decker 
might not even start, which 
would be seriously crushing 
along with Washington’s vari-
able performance. In order 
to win this match up I need 
both players to actually play, 
and play their best. Fajitas 
is starting Michael Crabtree 
and Steve Smith Sr., who both 
have the potential to do some 
damage if they get the targets. 
I honestly have no idea how 
this match up will turn out be-
cause I still don’t really know 
anything about football.
On tight end, I’ve been 
pretty happy with Ladarius 
Green. (Can I be honest that I 
still don’t actually know what 
a tight end does? Someone re-
mind me to google it [editor’s 
note: once upon a time a tight 
end was a sixth offensive line-
man who occasionally got out 
to receive short and intermedi-
ate passes. Now, a tight end is 
a sixth receiver who occasion-
ally blocks.] Antonio Gates 
returned from his suspension 
and then got a knee injury, so 
Green is still getting a good bit 
of targets. And when he does, 
he can really put up some 
points. Fajitas is starting Rich-
ard Rodgers, who has two ?rst 
names, so he must be awful.
I actually did end up pick-
ing up Dexter McCluster, 
whose name sounds like 
something a rooster might 
choke out at 5 a.m., for my 
?ex. This turned out to be an 
okay choice. He scored nine 
points in week six and six 
points in week seven, actually 
winning or tying both match 
ups. I think he’ll do well 
against Seattle’s Tyler Lock-
ett, who’s just inconsistent.
I’m giving the Jets one last 
chance to not screw every-
thing up this week against the 
Raiders, who have actually 
been somewhat of a force to 
be reckoned with this season. 
But Fajitas has the Chiefs D/
ST facing the Lions, and the 
Lions offense might totally 
choke under new leadership. 
I’m going to try to be hopeful 
in my Jets, but only time will 
tell.
And at kicker, I ?nally have 
McManus back. During his 
bye, my backup kicker Nick 
Folk did have a solid 13 point 
performance, but I’m still 
totally taken with my man 
Brandon. Sports editor Zeke 
Rosenberg tells me this is get-
ting creepy, which doesn’t 
matter to me. Match up irrel-
evant.
McManus is the only thing 
that matters.
Now that I’m 4–3, I’m not 
as con?dent in my team. I 
tried some random insult-
ing trades and they haven’t 
panned out, so I think my only 
hope at this point is to actually 
try and understand football.

Football
The Carnegie Mellon foot-
ball team traveled to Thiel 
for a game on Saturday. The 
Tartans dominated the Tom-
cats by a 73–19 margin. The 
fourth straight win for the 
Tartans brought their overall 
record to 5–3 and their Presi-
dents’ Athletic Conference 
(PAC) record to 5–2.
The second biggest scor-
ing day in Tartan history was 
also a record setting day for 
several players. Sophomore 
running back Sam Benger 
broke the single-season rush-
ing record for the Tartans. 
His 166 rushing yard per-
formance brought him to a 
season total of 1,453 rushing 
yards, surpassing the previ-
ous record of 1,326 set by 
Travis Sivek in 2006. Junior 
defensive end Brian Khoury 
made 3.0 sacks against Thiel, 
bringing his season total to a 
school record, beating 13.5 
sacks and besting the previ-
ous 11.0 mark held by Chris 
Balouris in 1989 and tied by 
Anima Nwankwo in 1998. Ju-
nior placekicker Gabe Renna 
converted all eight extra 
point attempts on the day, 
bringing his season total to 
36, beating out Nate Green-
stein’s 32 extra point kicks in 
2006.
The Tartans will next 
compete at home against the 
University of Chicago on Sat-
urday, Nov. 7.
Women’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team suf-
fered their ?rst loss of the 
season against the Washing-
ton University in St. Louis 
Bears.
The game was a pure de-
fensive battle from the mo-
ment the game started to 
the last whistle at the end 
of double overtime. Both of-
fenses had opportunities, 
with the Tartans taking 13 
shots and seven on goal com-
pared to the Bears’ 20 shots 
and six on goal. Washington 
goalkeeper Lizzy Crist and 
junior goalkeeper Katie Lis-
ton each made a number of 
saves throughout the game; 
however, Liston’s ?rst goal al-
lowed since Oct. 6 ended up 
being the determining factor 
in the 1–0 loss.
The team got back to win-
ning on Sunday, riding a 
four-goal second half to a 4–1 
victory.
The Tartans are now 14–
1–1 overall and 5–1 in Uni-
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) play. The Tartans will 
wrap up the regular season 
at Case Western on Saturday, 
Nov. 7.
Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team handily 
defeated Washington and St. 
Louis 3–1 on Friday.
After an evenly matched 
?rst half in which the Tar-
tans fell behind 1–0, the of-
fense took charge in the sec-
ond half. First-year defender 
Greg Bellwoar headed in a 
free kick from junior mid-
?elder Tristan Lockwood in 
the 54th minute. First-year 
mid?elder Anthony Gulli got 
the lead for the Tartans off a 
pass from ?rst-year mid?eld-
er Zack Masciopinto in the 
71st minute. Senior forward 
William Webb sealed the vic-
tory for the Tartans in the 
80th minute, taking in the 
rebound from a Masciopinto 
header attempt. First-year 
goalkeeper Alec Lam took 
over in goal for senior goal-
keeper Eric Bykowsky late in 
the ?rst half. Lam made six 
saves as the Tartans built up 
their lead.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
defeated the University of 
Chicago 1–0.
The Tartans will close out 
the season at Case Western 
on Saturday, Nov. 7.

The Carnegie Mellon Wom-
en’s volleyball team faced off 
against the Point Park Pio-
neers on Friday, coming off a 
big couple of wins last week-
end at the Juniata Wid Guisler 
Invitational in an attempt to 
improve on their impressive 
24–6 record.
Although the game was sta-
tistically set to go in Carnegie 
Mellon’s favor, it started off 
with an aggressive set of plays 
from Point Park as the Pio-
neers took control of the game 
with an early 3–0 lead in the 
?rst set, and the pressure was 
on Carnegie Mellon to keep 
up. The Tartans are a resil-
ient squad, however, and they 
would not let Point Park run 
away with the set. The Tartans 
responded quickly with a few 
scores of their own, but could 
never manage to take the lead 
from the Pioneers in the ?rst 
set. Each team applied pres-
sure to the other but neither 
managed to come out ahead 
in the ?rst section of the game. 
Toward the end of the ?rst set, 
Carnegie Mellon began to re-
veal a distinct rhythm to their 
play style, but could never 
take the lead from the relent-
less Point Park squad. The 
teams seemed to be engaged 
in a constant power struggle, 
with the Tartans being out-
sized by the Pioneers while 
simultaneously showing much 
more team cohesion to make 
up for it. Each team made sig-
ni?cant mistakes toward the 
end of the ?rst set, disallow-
ing Point Park from increasing 
their lead while Carnegie Mel-
lon failed to close the gap. The 
early scores that Point Park 
had put on the board proved 
to be the deciding factor in the 
?rst set.
The Tartans refused to 
give up, and in the second set 
opened with a strong series 
of volleys that ended in Carn-
egie Mellon gaining a signi?-
cant lead. This advantage was 
gained largely due to junior 
libero Molly Higgins, who set 
her team up with a playable 
ball time and time again, as 
she made miraculous digs 
consistently throughout the 
game to prove once again that 
she is the real backbone of her 
team’s success. But Point Park 
would not lay down despite 
Carnegie Mellon’s command-
ing lead. The Pioneers con-
tinued to ?ght valiantly in the 
face of impending defeat, but 
the resilient Tartan team did 
not allow the Pioneers to gain 
a lead at all during the set. The 
Tartans maintained their lead, 
although never running away 
with the game, and ended the 
second set victorious to tie the 
series 1–1.
The Tartans turned up 
the heat in the third set, 
spring boarding off of a Point 
Park yellow card to put the 
Carnegie Mellon squad up a 
comfortable six points early in 
the set. The Pioneers respond-
ed with formidable defensive 
resistance from their large 
front line, but could not man-
age to collapse the lead the 
Tartans had gained as a result 
of their mistakes earlier in the 
set. The Tartans carried their 
early lead smoothly through 
the rest of the set and took the 
lead in the series 2–1.
The fourth period carried 
on much in the same way as 
the third, with the Tartans 
gaining an early lead, though 
not as large as the one in the 
third period, and maintaining 
that lead until the end of the 
period. The Pioneers could 
not use their larger frontline 
to overtake the Tartans due to 
the superior teamwork shown 
by the Carnegie Mellon squad. 
Carnegie Mellon perfectly ex-
empli?ed their play style in 
this ?nal period as they estab-
lished a very clear rhythm of 
set, hit, score as soon as the 
ball made it to their side of the 
court. Higgins continued to be 
the anchor piece for this play 
style, managing to turn nearly 
every serve into a playable ball 
for her teammates. Point Park 
had no clear response to this 
established rhythm and began 
to crumble as a result of ac-
cumulated mistakes through-
out the set. Carnegie Mellon 
showed great defensive play 
at the net toward the end of 
the ?nal period, and while 
they did give up a few scores, 
they did not give Point Park 
any source of hope of winning 
the game. The Pioneers must 
be commended for their per-
severance, but ultimately the 
Tartans emerged victorious, 
closing out the ?nal set and 
taking the series 3–1.
The Tartan women’s volley-
ball team will next look to face 
off against a yet undetermined 
opponent in the UAA champi-
onship, which will determine 
their place in the conference 
as well as place them in the 
NCAA national championship 
tournament if they emerge 
victorious. No matter who 
their opponent is, the Tartans 
will look to apply the same 
pressure as they did in this 
game against Point Park in or-
der to advance their position 
in the national standings.

Swimming and Diving opens season with dominating win
JORDAN SAFER
Staffwriter
Looking to start the season 
off with a bang, the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving teams 
began competition this Sat-
urday on campus. Both teams 
pro?ted from the occasion, us-
ing the quad meet and home 
opener to improve their re-
cords to 3–0. The victories 
were lopsided in the Tartan’s 
favor for both genders, with 
the men’s team overcoming 
their biggest challenge from 
Case Western Reserve, 188–
109, and the women’s team 
crushing their closest opposi-
tion from Clarion University, 
195–103.
The women gave early in-
dication of a dominant per-
formance by taking ?rst and 
second in the 200-yard Med-
ley Relay to open the meet. 
Junior butter?y and freestyle 
specialist Gillian Crews helped 
put the women’s A team a step 
ahead with a great leg in the 
butter?y.
The men followed suit, 
buoyed by unmatched speed 
from sophomore breast stroke 
swimmer Matthew Chu and 
?rst-year breast stroke swim-
mer Winston Chu. Both over-
took a Case Western swimmer 
on the breast stroke leg to give 
both the men’s A and B teams 
insurmountable leads.
Both teams appeared 
comfortable and con?dent 
throughout, both individu-
ally and as a group. With the 
Tartan swimmers in lanes 2 
and 6, it was a common sight 
to see a Carnegie swimmer in 
lane 6 win their race, look up, 
and calmly glance over to lane 
2 to con?rm the presence of 
another Carnegie swimmer up 
near the front.
And when one of the swim-
mers on the deck accidentally 
dropped their lap counter into 
the pool for a few laps dur-
ing the women’s 500-yard 
Freestyle, it was a laughing 
matter, as the Tartans took 
the ?rst two spots in the race 
regardless.
Even as the teams raced 
ahead on the scoreboard, the 
swimmers stayed involved 
in the meet through the end, 
cheering their teammates on 
from the sidelines up until the 
last lap. In a few tight contests, 
the swimmers on the sidelines 
got involved by chanting “Go, 
go, go” in time with breast-
stroke bobs, and waving their 
hands to urge the Carnegie 
swimmers in the race to some 
tight wins.
First-year freestyle and but-
ter?y specialist Mitchell Riek 
made a big impact in his ?rst 
race in college, winning all 3 
of his races. Riek helped build 
early momentum for the men’s 
team with a dominant 1000-
yard Freestyle. In the race, 
Riek started strong, and kept 
a hard pace to lose the rest of 
the ?eld about 500 yards into 
the race. His time of 9:42.97 
was over 13 seconds faster 
than the winning time for the 
race last year.
Riek followed up the effort 
with a comfortable win in 200-
yard Butter?y, and a narrow, 
come-from-behind win in the 
200-yard Individual Medley 
(IM). In the IM, Reik appeared 
to ?ght to stay near the lead-
er through 150 yards before 
powering to the line and nab-
bing the win.
Re?ecting on his races, 
Riek relished  in the exciting 
?nish of the 200 IM. “I haven’t 
swum the thousand before. 
That was my ?rst time, so I 
didn’t really know what to ex-
pect from that. And two ?y... 
I’ve done that a lot so there’s 
not much excitement, but I 
like doing the 2 IM. It’s kind of 
one of my off events, so it’s fun 
to swim.”
On the women’s side, 
sophomore IM and butter-
?y specialist Mary St. John 
contributed a few strong per-
formances of her own to the 
Tartan onslaught, with wins in 
the 200-yard Butter?y and the 
500-yard Freestyle races. St. 
John’s win in the butter?y was 
especially impressive given 
that she spent most of the race 
swimming in third, before tak-
ing the lead late to get the win.
In the diving portion of 
competition, both teams were 
challenged by Clarion Univer-
sity, who placed ahead of the 
Tartans in all four diving com-
petitions. However, solid per-
formances allowed the Carn-
egie men and women to earn 
points over the other teams, 
and pick up some against 
Clarion with the help of strong 
performances from divers like 
junior diver Machika Kaku. 
Kaku placed third in the 3-me-
ter dive with a score of 206.95, 
only ?nishing behind divers 
from Clarion.
Both teams had a lot of 
success due to a combination 
of good competition at the 
front and strong depth. Riek 
observed that the teams “had 
a lot of one twos,” pointing to 
the number of good swimmers 
picking up points for the team.
A lot of the excitement 
and energy going into the 
meet helped contribute to the 
success. As Riek put it, “Ev-
eryone’s excited. You’re high-
?ving everyone. Everyone’s in 
a good mood. It’s a good envi-
ronment and that creates good 
racing.”
Going forward, both the 
men’s and women’s teams will 
look to continue their success 
and build on this competition 
leading up to the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Championships in March. 
Next week, the teams will try 
to add onto their undefeated 
records as they go to Grove 
City College to take on the 
home team and the University 
of Rochester.

Gaylen Ross speaks to students
Producer, writer, and director discusses storytelling in ?lm
Gaylen Ross is an actress turned producer, 
writer, and director. Her transition was triggered 
by an epiphany during a beach scene: she 
noticed how much better it looked on the other 
side of the camera, how non-actors did not 
get splashed or covered in sand. She visited 
Carnegie Mellon University last Thursday to 
talk about storytelling through film. She began 
by speaking about how much movies have 
changed. How when she was younger, half the 
fun of a movie was watching it in the middle 
and having to guess what happened in the first 
half. Films have lost this essence, Ross said, and 
now they so clearly spell out the story for the 
viewer that it is almost impossible to guess or 
interpret any of it for yourself. As someone who 
does not think about movies much beyond the 
theater, I thought this was very interesting. Do 
I not think about movies long after I see them 
because of how clearly the plot is spelled out to 
me? Does the lack of outside thought required 
make me a passive movie watcher?
As I pondered this, Ross launched into how she 
chooses to layout the films she puts together. 
The first of her films that she spoke of was 
Caris’ Peace. This was a film she made about 
her late friend Caris Corfman, an actress from 
the Yale School of Drama who starred in several 
movies before developing a brain tumor that 
caused her to lose her short term memory. Ross 
discussed how important it was to not make 
the focus of the story that she got back onstage 
after this, but how she got back on stage. Ross 
explained that she did this to keep the film from 
being a cliché story about someone overcoming 
obstacles to finally achieve something that 
she thought she could not do. By starting the 
documentary off by showing that Corfman does 
get back onstage, the viewers were allowed to 
focus more on her journey rather than wondering 
if it would all be in vain.
Many of the excerpts that Ross shared of her 
films showed how she always tries to find the 
most unconventional way to tell a story. The 
most interesting way she did this was in her 
film Killing Kasztner: The Jew who Dealt with 
the Nazis , a movie about the life and death of 
Rudolf Kastner, a Hungarian Jew that helped 
other Jews escape occupied Europe during 
the Holocaust. Ross spent years collecting 
information on the subject not to build a 
case for or against Kastner, but to provide 
a comprehensive story and let the viewers 
decide which side of history was correct. She 
chose to begin this film by allowing Kastner’s 
assassin, Ze’ev Eckstein, to tell his side of the 
story first. This definitely made it harder as a 
viewer because there were moments where 
Eckstein would do or say something funny, but 
it felt wrong to get attached to him the way you 
would to any other person who was sharing the 
intimate details of his life with you.
Ross talked about how smart he was to build 
this sense of trust and understanding with 
those watching him so that at the end of the 
film when he recants his story and says that he 
actually didn’t shoot Kastner, you almost believe 
him. The film then goes on to the perspectives 
of Kastner’s daughter and granddaughters, 
which admittedly were not as interesting as 
the perspective of the assassin. The way that 
Ross not only arranged this film to include his 
perspective and make the film more unbiased, 
but set it in the present tense instead of 
focusing on the past was refreshing. I felt that 
this helped to make the story more relatable 
and also show how the version of history that is 
perpetuated can influence the present.
Overall, I really enjoyed the perspective that 
Ross had to offer regarding how to enhance 
stories by telling them through film. There 
are so many different ways to put together 
the different puzzle pieces of a story to make 
it much more interesting. By starting with a 
question that either can or can’t be answered, 
Ross challenges viewers to focus on things that 
usually would not be the focal point of a movie, 
such as the man behind the gun or how hard it 
is for a woman with no short term memory to 
remember why she is on stage in the first place. 
I cannot promise that I will be a more active 
movie watcher, but it would be nice if movies 
challenged me to be one a little more.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Joshua,
I’m having an existential 
crisis, and I don’t know 
who to talk to, and this 
public forum seems to be 
the best place to air my 
dirty laundry. So I started 
seeing this guy, and he 
was kinda perfect and 
kinda cute, and his feet 
didn’t smell bad, and just 
based on that, I thought 
he was marriage material. 
Anyway, we broke up last 
night because he said he 
just didn’t feel anything 
anymore, so I pinched him 
really hard, but that just 
made him angry. Anyway, 
we’re not together any 
more, and my world is 
crashing down, and it was 
right before our second 
weekaversary, and it’s 
just so unexpected. I had 
our entire lives planned 
out for us, right up to 
the names of our four 
kids — Danny, Damian, 
Baptista and Carl — 
and our collection of 
antique cuckoo clocks. 
He just had the most 
perfect earlobes, man. 
And like, I even knew his 
middle name. If that’s 
not intimate, I’m not sure 
what is. My question is 
what do I do to get over 
him? I’ve never had an 
actual relationship before, 
and this kind of shattered 
my hope of finding one.
Signed, 
Romantic Ovaries Missing 
Connection with Ornery 
Male
Dear ROMCOM,
I’m sorry that your 
relationship didn’t work out. 
It’s never a fun feeling.
My advice is that there are 
more fish in the sea, more 
people out there, all that 
jazz. This was not the only 
love you will ever have, and 
there will be other guys with 
whom to share your future 
and your antique cuckoo 
clocks. I know that’s not 
helpful for the emotional 
situation you’re in, but you 
should never let someone’s 
lack of love toward you to 
affect your hope or your 
confidence. You seem like 
someone with big dreams 
and a big heart, and I’m sure 
other people will appreciate 
that. In regard to what you 
might be feeling, the best 
thing to do is just feel — 
just spend a night doing 
whatever helps you burn 
these emotions, whether that 
be spending a night alone, 
with people, doing nothing, 
or doing anything. Accept 
your emotions rather than 
fight them. It’s all healthy 
expression. Then, once 
you’re all felt out, redirect 
that love to yourself, that 
emotional intensity into your 
work, and charge forward 
with your life. I believe in you.
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown,
Adviser Extraordinaire

Let’s be honest: no one likes doing the dishes. 
Unfortunately, the reality of the looming adulthood that 
lies before each of us forces the matter when it comes 
time to cook a dinner that is anything beyond pita and 
hummus. Envisioning a satisfying home-cooked meal 
invariably comes with visions of a sink piled high with 
skillets, pots, and pans of all kinds, but it doesn’t have 
to be that way. As the weather cools, turn to these 
three hearty recipes, all distinctly different yet sharing 
one shining quality: they are made with only one pot.
One-Skillet Vegetable Fry
As with many of these recipes, the base of this recipe is 
the vegetables that you choose. Follow my lead or forge 
your own path — whatever combination you stumble 
upon will be satisfying and ?lling.
Ingredients:
1 medium onion, chopped
1 zucchini, chopped
1 yellow squash, chopped
1 can of corn
Cooked noodles 
Feta cheese
Avocado 
1 egg per serving (optional)
Directions:
1. Sautée onion, zucchini, and squash in olive oil until 
cooked, about ?ve minutes.
2. When cooked, add the noodles and the corn to the 
pan and let everything cook together for roughly ?ve 
minutes.
3. Distribute the mixture into bowls.
4. Fry the eggs individually in the pan.
5. Assemble: mixture on bottom, egg on top of that, half 
of a sliced avocado, then feta cheese on top.
One-Pan Mexican Meal
Filling, spicy, and everything you want at any given 
time of the day, this dish can be served up for breakfast 
after a late night out, an inspired lunch on an otherwise 
sad Monday, or a nice dinner to round out your day.
Ingredients: 
1 can of black beans
1 can of corn
1 can of tomatoes
1 tsp of garlic powder and cumin
1 cup of quinoa 
1 cup of chicken broth
Cheddar cheese
1 egg per serving
Directions:
1. Put the ?rst six ingredients in the pot and cover. Let 
it cook for 20 minutes. 
2. Put the bean mixture in bowls and top with cheddar 
cheese. Set aside to melt.
3. Fry the eggs individually in the pot that you just 
used. 
4. Serve the eggs on top of the melted cheese, then top 
with a little more cheese if you’re feeling adventurous.
Chili
Pick your poison with this one. Whether or not you 
decide to include the meat, this recipe will ?ll you up 
and fuel your journey to an easy clean-up in one go.
Ingredients:
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves of garlic, chopped
1 pound of turkey or ground beef, if you’re using meat
1 can each of garbanzo beans, black beans, corn, and 
kidney beans
1 can of tomato sauce
1 can of diced tomatoes
1 tsp each of chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, 
pepper, and cumin, then add to taste
Directions:
1. Sautee the onion and garlic in a few glugs of olive oil 
until the onion is translucent. 
2. Add the turkey or beef or tofu or nothing, if that’s 
how you’re swinging. Brown thoroughly. 
3. Add the beans and the tomatoes. Stir everything 
together and then add all of the spices. 
4. Add the tomato sauce and the water. Stir, then cover 
and let simmer for 30–45 minutes. 
5. Taste to make sure that it is well spiced, then serve 
with a dollup of sour cream and a hunk of bread. 
Pro tip: slap some plastic wrap on top of the pot, and 
you don’t even need a leftover container.

The Voice dumbs down its reality content
Popular and entertaining vocal competition show does not take advantage of illustrious coaches
The Voice — which is in all rights the successor of 
American Idol in the hearts and minds of Americans — 
is currently in the middle of a dramatic ninth season. The 
show follows contestants from their auditions through 
various stages of competition: the Battle Rounds, the 
Knockouts, and the Live Performances. Contestants 
are split into four teams when they audition, with each 
team being led by a coach. A variety of musical greats 
have been coaches, but the current season presents 
the coaching abilities of Adam Levine, Gwen Stefani, 
Pharrell Williams, and Blake Shelton.
Each of the performers talk about their enthusiasm and 
excitement about working with a coach, and what an 
amazing opportunity it is. During the course of the show, 
we see clips from the coaching sessions where the coach 
or guest coach — another musician who is called in for a 
round — offers criticism. These clips are often followed 
by produced segments where the coaches talk about an 
individual’s strengths and weaknesses to camera. Even 
though The Voice is a phenomenon, it has been dumbed 
down for viewers in a way that’s detrimental to the show 
and its value in America.
The Voice excels in many ways. The format, with various 
rounds, keeps viewers entertained. The variety is more 
fun to watch, and the Battle and Knockout rounds show 
really fascinating juxtaposition between two artists 
pitted against one another. I have not long been a faithful 
follower of The Voice, but I do have an appreciation for 
the talent and growth that the singers often exhibit. I 
never have the gumption to vote for performers once 
the show reaches the Live Performance round, but I still 
get irrationally angry when those I like are eliminated. I 
often skip through the dialogue parts, and when coaches 
are arguing to convince a particular performer of their 
superiority, I usually turn down the volume because I 
don’t ?nd it that exciting. So I totally recognize that I 
am not the most devoted of supporters, and that my 
criticisms come from a place of semi-enthusiasm.
That being said, one aspect that really attracts me about 
The Voice is the idea of mentorship and guidance. The 
four coaches are given time to work with each of their 
contestants, and that is an exciting moment to witness. 
As a musician, I like the idea of a coach helping the 
singers work through their songs, ?nding aspects of 
their voice that are stronger and giving them tips to 
help their performance. The show is all about giving 
new musicians opportunities to grow and learn and 
maybe break into the industry, so watching the coaches 
share their knowledge should be a special and exciting 
experience for aspiring singers around the nation.
This is where I think the show gets too dumbed down. 
Even though America is not ?lled with people who want 
to be singers or who know the ins and outs of musical 
and vocal training, repetitive quotes from coaches 
about needing to “believe in what someone is singing” 
or “feeling emotional with the song,” are unnecessary 
and don’t teach audiences anything about the work 
musicians and coaches are doing to maximize an 
individual’s performance. I’m not saying that coaches 
are lying or that emotional messages don’t matter, but 
this sort of communication can be improved upon with 
strides in technical skill or performance practice. While 
it’s possible that the coaches don’t have any other useful 
pieces of advice, it is more likely that producers of the 
show choose not to air the moments in which more 
nitty-gritty work is being done.
This season has been notable to me because of a slight 
increase in the instances of actual technical advice and 
musical aids. Rihanna, a guest host on the Knockout 
Rounds last week, gave advice that actually related to 
moments in the song where an individual could improve. 
Even hearing Rihanna sing with the kind of changes she 
was looking for demonstrated, with clarity, the actual 
improvement she was asking for. I don’t think that the 
show and coaching sessions have to be as serious as a 
masterclass, but I think the show could be incredibly 
useful for those around the nation who have not been 
able to receive vocal training. Having the opportunity to 
hear coaches sing, or act out with their bodies a certain 
choreographic step, not only gives audiences a glimpse 
as to the hard and detailed work it takes to succeed, but 
also humanizes the stars.
Oversimplifying the role of the coach in The Voice 
damages and detracts from what is inherently special 
and different about this reality show. While this season 
shows marked improvements in the technical advice 
that contestants receive, there is still space for the show 
to grow into a staple that both entertains and educates 
those who view it. It’s nice to pretend that success 
comes from a fundamental emotional core, but there is 
a lot of work needed to communicate feelings in music. 
Reality TV is in general dumbed down to an excessively 
formulaic and repetitive form of entertainment, which 
makes the popular show The Voice an excellent choice 
for inciting change in the genre.

6paranormal
pillbox 11.02.15
It is hard to forget the original buzz generated back 
in 2009 by the wide release of the ?rst installment of 
the Paranormal Activity series. It was released with 
advertisements that “guaranteed nightmares” and 
recommended that you “don’t see it alone.” The movie 
fared decently well among critics, and the series 
continued. However, ratings for the series have followed 
a negative trend and declined pretty steadily with each 
?lm.
The latest movie, ?lm number six, was released on Oct. 
23. Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension promised 
similar thrills as its predecessors, even adding, “For the 
?rst time you will see the activity.” Personally, though 
admittedly unsatis?ed with the last ?ve Paranormal 
Activity movies, ?nding them predictable and full of 
holes, I was still willing to give this installment a chance.
The Ghost Dimension was directed by Gregory Plotkin, 
who had not been previously involved in the Paranormal 
Activity series. Hoping that this change would vary the 
directing style of the ?lm (after all, this is the sixth movie 
in the series), I was disappointed to see that the ?lm’s 
basic style, which consists mainly of shaky, night-vision, 
POV camera footage, remained unchanged.
The Ghost Dimension opens on a young family that 
has recently moved into their new home. Parents Ryan 
and Emily Fleege (played by Chris J. Murray and Brit 
Shaw, respectively) are decorating the living room for 
Christmas with their young daughter Leila (Ivy George). 
We are quickly introduced to Ryan’s brother Mike, and 
family friend Skylar (played by Dan Gill and Olivia Taylor 
Dudley, respectively) who are planning to stay with the 
family over the winter holidays. Although the opening 
of the ?lm seemed quite cookie cutter, and the whole 
“young family moves into a new home in a new town” 
thing had a strong resemblance to the opening of several 
other Paranormal Activity ?lms, I was happy to see the 
?lm seemed to be moving a little faster than others in the 
series.
Fast-forward a little, and Ryan and Mike are outside 
decorating when Mike ?nds an old box of VHS tapes and 
a video camera. Here we are met with another classic 
scary movie cliché — “It was probably left over from the 
previous owners.” Naturally, they watch all the tapes and 
mess around with the video camera. Those who have 
seen previous installments of the Paranormal Activity 
series would recognize both the content on the ?lms and 
the ?lms themselves. The ?lms have been passed around 
between several families, and they include recurring 
footage of characters that appeared previously in the 
series. The two young girls in the videos seem to be 
interacting with a paranormal being named Toby, who 
becomes an integral a part of The Ghost Dimension.
The movie pace picks up a little as Leila starts acting 
strange. She tries to bury her mother’s rosary and burn 
a bible in the ?replace. It wasn’t a huge shock to ?nd 
out that Leila’s explanation for the strange doings was 
that Toby told her to. Given the title of the movie, The 
Ghost Dimension, one might think that we are ?nally 
making progress in the series and coming a little closer 
to ?guring out what exactly is possessing everyone in 
the series, who exactly Toby is, and where exactly this 
dimension is. We’ve been in suspense since the original 
Paranormal Activity. We’ve seen family after family be 
affected by the same demonic being, Toby. Perhaps the 
idea behind such a mystery is to keep viewers coming 
back for the next ?lm, but a six-movie-long mystery 
seems a tad bit excessive.
For about forty minutes, the movie consists of Ryan 
walking around his house with the video camera ?lming 
some strange black mist, presumably Toby, which 
seems to interact with Leila. There was a lengthy period 
of not-so-paranormal activity that could probably be 
explained by a draft in the kitchen or an open window in 
Leila’s room. The same cliché scary movie scenes ensue: 
The camera gets knocked over, pots and pans from the 
kitchen fall over, a loud bang is heard in the living room 
and a startled wife yells “What was that?!” The only real 
thrills up to this point happened when the mist would ?y 
passed the camera, and that was really only due to that 
fact that The Ghost Dimension was in 3D.
The movie is nearly over at this point, and no real 
action has transpired. Convinced that Toby is going 
to take Leila away, the family sets up the camera in 
Leila’s room and consults a priest in the hopes that they 
may rid their daughter of the evil spirits. The family is 
gathered together in the living room with the priest. 
In a very sudden turn of events, the movie goes, quite 
literally, from a crawling pace to a full on sprint in terms 
of paranormal activity. The lights in the house go out, 
and the movie switches to a very familiar night vision, 
POV footage, because for some reason Ryan still feels 
the need to use the video camera. The room is in chaos. 
Toby somehow morphs into human form. There is a 
great deal of screaming. The footage is so shaky that it 
is unclear what happens to Skylar, Ryan, Mike, or the 
priest. They are there one moment and gone the next. 
Are they dead? Maybe. It’s odd that the characters 
all died at once, but there was hardly even time to be 
scared or upset at the loss of over half of the cast, as the 
movie was in full throttle at this point.
Emily chases a very possessed Leila up to her room, 
where she enters into a portal to what the viewer 
assumes is the ghost dimension. Are we ?nally going to 
see who Toby is? Are we ?nally going to be exposed to 
this strange world where all these tapes of lost footage 
are coming from? For those, including myself, who 
assumed The Ghost Dimension would ?nally answer 
these questions unfortunately waited in vain. We are left 
with even more unanswered questions as the ?lm closes 
with Leila walking out of frame with Toby, whom we only 
ever get to see from the knees down.
What happens to Leila? What becomes of her family? 
Who is Toby? Will the tapes get passed on again? All 
in all, the movie was predictable and full of cliché 
scenarios. A scare here and there, but nothing dramatic. 
In true Paranormal Activity fashion, the ?lm closes with 
the obvious set up for an additional installment. Am I 
excited? Not really. Will I see it in the hopes that they will 
?nally, after seven ?lms, reveal what the hell is going on? 
Probably.

opera
pillbox 11.02.157
La Scuola Degli Amanti, the Carnegie Mellon School 
Of Music’s latest production, is best described by the 
literal translation of its name — “The School of Love and 
In?delity.” La Scuola is built around three operas — Cosi 
fan tutte, Don Giovanni, Le nozze di Figaro. All three, 
collaborations between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 
and Lorenzo Da Ponte, are legendary works. Scored by 
Mozart at the height of his genius, all three are amongst 
the most brutally honest, dark, and hauntingly beautiful 
expressions of what it means to be in and out of love. 
La Scuola takes these classics and does something very 
brave, melding them into a single production set across 
multiple timelines.
In La Scuola, scenes from Cosi fan tutte are set in the 
modern era, from Don Giovanni are set in the roaring 
‘20s, and from Le nozze di Figaro are in the original 
18th century setting. As such, La Scuola has a very 
interesting narrative structure. Scenes from each 
timeline are interspersed with others, making for a 
heady contrast for the audience. Nevertheless there are 
unifying ideas to the entire production. As a whole, La 
Scuola explores the roles that men and women play in 
relationships; it makes the argument that certain themes 
— like love and ?delity — are timeless concepts.
Successfully reinterpreting not one or two, but three 
classics is a herculean task to say the least. Doing it over 
three different eras, and interspersing the scenes with 
each other is more dif?cult still. And though this brave 
structure makes for a revolutionary production in theory, 
some of it doesn’t come off perfectly. Some of the scenes 
seem out of place. Some of the lines seem incredibly 
dated in a modern context. In Cosi fan tutte, for example, 
women are represented as weak-willed and super?cial. 
Such depictions might have been the norm in 18th 
century Vienna; put in a modern setting, however, 
this misogyny seems incoherent. This, and other such 
instances make La Scuola’s themes seem far from 
timeless, and end up distracting from the productions 
underlying message.
Ideation aside, the execution of La Scuola is ?awless. If 
you haven’t seen many performances from the School 
of Music, prepare to be blown away. From the singing 
to the arrangements, Mozart is unbelievably layered 
and intricate, with abrupt key changes, and strange 
time signatures. The cast and orchestra make it all look 
downright easy. Not to mention, the set and costume 
design are downright spectacular. A simple and 
minimalist set successfully morphs from a small private 
chamber to a large party space to an enchanted snowy 
forest. The costumes are used to convey era and mood. 
Modern day Cosi fan tutte has characters that dress in 
loud and garish contemporary attire. 1920s Don Giovanni 
has characters that represent the gentry of that era. 
18th century Nozze has characters that represent 18th 
Century aristocracy.
Ultimately, La Scuola is a very well-staged piece — 
there isn’t a wrong glance, ?at note, or an off-time 
beat. The ideas that form its foundation are brave and 
forward-thinking. That said, most of La Scuola’s greatest 
?ourishes are far too subtle and opaque to someone not 
well versed in 18th century Viennese Opera Buffa. If you 
happen to be an avid connoisseur of Mozart, you will 
be highly impressed by an interesting and ?awlessly 
executed reinterpretation of his greatest work. If La 
Scuola happens to be your ?rst or second opera, you’ll 
probably walk out at the end more than just a little 
confused.

Exciting future for movies releasing in 2016 
From potential Oscar buzz for Leonardo Dicaprio to Suicide Squad, next year promises to deliver
Leonardio DiCaprio comments on next film: 
The Revenant
Leonardo DiCaprio chooses roles much the same way 
a professional ball player chooses which pitches to 
swing at: it has to be perfect, and it has to present 
the best opportunity to score. Whether or not “score” 
means Oscar contention or a chance to work with 
a revered director, it is apparent that DiCaprio has 
a pretty good batting average. His new film, The 
Revenant, is set for a Dec. 25, 2015 release, and 
the film looks to be another cinematic masterpiece, 
much ado to two-time Academy Award winning 
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Gravity, 
Birdman). DiCaprio sat down with Yahoo! Movies to 
discuss the new film, and his comments make me 
anticipate The Revenant even more, which I did not 
think was possible. DiCaprio stated, “It’s going to be 
one of the most unique film-going experiences that 
audiences have seen in modern times...”
The film takes place in the frozen wilderness and the 
filmmaking team spent nine months in remote parts 
of Canada and Argentina, using only natural light to 
film. When asked about the harsh filming conditions, 
Leo responded, “The truth is that I knew what I was 
getting into. This was a film that had been floating 
around for quite some time, but nobody was crazy 
enough to really take this on, simply because of 
the logistics of where we needed to shoot and the 
amount of work and rehearsal that would have to be 
done to achieve Alejandro [and Lubezki’s] vision. 
They’re very specific about their shots and what 
they want to achieve, and that — compounded with 
the fact that we were in an all-natural environment, 
succumbing to whatever nature gave us — was 
something that became more of a profoundly intense 
chapter of our lives than we ever thought it was 
going to be.”
Nothing is certain in film, but I anticipate The 
Revenant to be in the Oscar conversation come the 
new year. All the right pieces are in place. All we can 
do is wait and see.
Chris Rock to host the Oscars
Speaking of the Oscars, let’s talk about the upcoming 
88th Academy Awards and how the show’s producers 
decided to bring back, after 11 years, one of the 
most celebrated comedians around. Comedian, actor, 
writer, producer, director, and documentarian Chris 
Rock will return as host for the Feb. 28 broadcast 
of the “Biggest Night In Hollywood.” Rock and the 
Academy butted heads in the decade since 2005, 
the last time he hosted, regarding the Academy’s 
“white-washing” the awards, but the tensions have 
since died down. Today, we can finally wise up and 
recognize that Chris Rock’s comedic style might be 
the perfect breath of fresh air for an Academy Award, 
which has taken a recent dip in the ratings since its 
height in 2014 under Ellen DeGeneres’ hosting. Chris 
Rock is hilarious, intelligent, adept, socially aware, 
dramatically talented, and charmingly snarky. He 
checks all the boxes for great hosting and brings that 
one-of-a-kind voice as a cherry on top.
Jared Leto speaks out about his role as the 
Joker
The Joker may be the most famous villain in 
entertainment. Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader are 
contenders, but when the Clown Prince of Crime 
enters the scene, no good can happen. There have 
been several accounts of Jared Leto never breaking 
character on the set of the upcoming Suicide 
Squad, but Leto himself has finally commented on 
what it was like to become the most feared villain 
in Gotham, “There was definitely a period of... 
detachment. I took a pretty deep dive. But this was 
a unique opportunity and I couldn’t imagine doing it 
another way. It was fun, playing those psychological 
games. But at the same time it was very painful, like 
giving birth out of my pr**k hole.”
Director David Ayer also spoke about Leto’s Joker, 
and how this incarnation will differentiate itself from 
past Jokers we have seen on screen, “The Joker is 
the third rail of comic book movies. There’s a power 
to that character, and by some freaking miracle, 
through the incredible things Jared has done and 
the photography and all the other millions of things 
that went into it, we’ve cooked up something 
transcendent. He’s scary.”
A scary Joker? So, all the past Jokers were not scary? 
Sure, the Joker in the comic books has done things 
no film has come close to, but is this when we get 
the frightening psychopathic rage that The Joker 
embodies? I’m already going to be first in line when 
Suicide Squad is released on Aug. 5, 2016, but if this 
Joker is the most rampant, psychotic, frightening 
Joker we’ve ever seen, I might just have to camp out 
at the ticket booth.
Nicholas Hoult and Rooney Mara to star in The 
Discovery
Nicholas Hoult entered my radar as Beast in X-Men: 
First Class, but has only recently become a name to 
remember when he appeared as Nux in Mad Max: 
Fury Road. Rooney Mara’s talents are undeniable, 
especially for those who have seen her Academy 
Award nominated performance in The Girl With The 
Dragon Tattoo. It is now being reported that Hoult 
and Mara will be seen together in The Discovery.
Directed by relative newcomer Charlie McDowell, 
the film is a romance set in a world one year after 
scientific proof of an afterlife has been discovered. 
Hoult plays the son of the man responsible for the 
discovery while Mara plays Hoult’s love interest, 
whose life is “tinged by a tragic past.”
The concept sounds very intriguing and fresh. 
Hollywood has been criticized recently for not 
producing much, if any, original material; only 
sequels and films based on comic books get released. 
Much the same as any casual pedestrian buying 
pizza, you buy a pizza you trust. Trying a new place 
is a bit frightening. New ideas and untested scripts 
are frightening to studios, especially when they 
may need to hand over tens of millions of dollars. 
I hold that same skepticism. On the other hand, I 
may not know McDowell’s directing abilities, but 
having Hoult and Mara involved tells me the acting 
caliber is far from untested. The Discovery is set to 
start production in Rhode Island in January 2016. 
No release date has been set, but anticipate waiting 
until 2017 to buy your tickets.

pillbox 11.02.159
Weird, scary, and uproariously funny (especially at 11 
p.m. on a Friday), Carnegie Mellon’s Scotch‘n’Soda 
performed Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson in the 
Jared L. Cohon University Center’s McConomy 
Auditorium over Halloweekend.
The opening number sets just the right off-kilter tone 
for the evening. The ensemble sings about political 
populism wearing all the components of 19th century 
garb, assembled in a punk rock fashion: Corsets 
are donned over dresses, dresses are cropped and 
shirt sleeves are rolled up to the elbow. The band 
itself doesn’t even play along with this 19th century 
front, wearing t-shirts and skinny jeans and rocking 
electric/acoustic guitar, bass, and keyboard. Modern 
cuss words and characters, including a spirited 
history nerd played by undeclared Dietrich College 
first year Anna Jamieson Beck as narrator, are 
sprinkled throughout the play, keeping the level of 
absurdity high throughout.
Beck is just one of many strong supporting roles, 
several of which are played by a few prominent 
ensemble cast members. The talent of the overall 
ensemble was evident in the numerous high-energy 
song and group dance numbers. Additionally, the 
ensemble was versatile, able to switch between 
multiple roles throughout. Whether it was the 
American punk rock groupies, the Indian tribe 
members, or the modern tourists, they brought the 
right tone to each.
After the opening number, the play begins with 
Jackson’s childhood, though the actors, characters, 
and costumes hardly change with the exception of a 
few indicative props (e.g. slinky indicates childhood). 
Junior philosophy major Tim Brooks plays the 
controversial Andrew Jackson who, in this universe, 
wears tight leather pants and a white t-shirt. The 
costume hardly makes sense in this childhood scene, 
where both of Jackson’s parents are killed suddenly 
by “Injuns.” However, the following scene resolves 
the contradictory cues by finding Jackson in a bar, 
standing drunkenly on top of a table to tell his friends 
about the “valiant” battle that he lead against the 
Spaniards in Florida. The audience learns quickly 
that Jackson is a nontraditional hero.
Soon after, Jackson’s future wife, Rachel — played 
by Rachel Griswold, an undeclared first year in 
Dietrich College — is introduced. However, even a 
love interest doesn’t humanize Jackson for more than 
a few minutes as their relationship turns from cute 
to downright disgusting. To highlight and poke fun 
at the darkness of their relationship, the band begins 
to play sickeningly sweet and upbeat pop while the 
explicit scene continues in the background. Rachel 
is opposed to Jackson’s status as a public figure, 
causing tension in their relationship as he tries to 
usurp the power from the elitist group ruling over 
Washington, including figures like John Quincy 
Adams, Martin Van Buren, and John Calhoun, 
played by 5th year senior BSA major Alex Petti, 
undeclared Dietrich College first year Philip DeCicco, 
and undeclared Dietrich College first year Jordan 
Romah respectively. These characters are no less 
ridiculous than the ones before them. Their debut is 
choreographed to the musical stylings of Katy Perry, 
which is both hilarious and in perfect opposition to 
the stark individualism of the punk rock movement.
Jackson runs for the presidency twice, where he 
succeeds the second time after being beaten by 
John Quincy Adams in the first. The race features 
a spectacular musical battle between the two 
candidates as they communicate political ideologies 
via punk rock sentiments, complete with modern 
colloquialisms. When Jackson finally takes on his 
role as president, he finds himself disillusioned by 
the contradictory attitudes of the American people. 
They want land, but they don’t want to drive out 
the native tribes. They need space, but don’t want 
any bloodshed. While frustrating for Jackson, it was 
equally frustrating to the 11 p.m. audience, whom 
frequently jumped out of their seats to either cheer 
on or ridicule decisions that are made on stage.
Although mostly in jest, the play moves its audience 
in unexpected ways. Surprisingly, equal to the 
conflict between characters is the conflict that the 
audience feels with the characters. The appalling 
racism of Jackson and others feels archaic and 
callous. The audience, while laughing at the 
ridiculous and playful script, is also aware of the 
painful truth behind the words. The production 
leverages this poignancy on multiple occasions 
including the performances for “Ten Little Indians,” 
a song inspired by the poem written by Septimus 
Winner in 1868, and an ending scene where the 
cast is positioned and frozen to visually portray the 
horrifying Trail of Tears. In these moments, there is 
no humor, the strange punk rock setting becomes 
unimportant, and all that we can focus on is the 
horror of this undeniable historical tragedy.
Ultimately, Scotch’n’Soda’s Bloody Bloody Andrew 
Jackson led to an evening of bloody merriment 
punctuated by moments of sincere drama. The 
energy was electric and the audience certainly got 
what they asked for as they spent an evening this 
Halloweekend immersed in a violent and satirical 
reality.

pillbox 11.02.15
Popular comedian Aziz Ansari will release ten 
episodes of his new television series, Master of None, 
to Netflix on Friday, Nov. 6. Ansari gained fame and 
popularity with his portrayal of Tom Haverford on 
Amy Poehler’s comedy Parks & Recreation, in which 
Haverford navigated the politics of small government 
with loose morals and bizarre antics. Since then, 
Ansari has entertained his fans with various comedy 
specials, most notably Intimate Moments for a 
Sensual Evening, and has, most recently, charmed 
America with his book Modern Romance. But 
beside his achievements in the world of comedy as 
it pertains to appearances and specials, Ansari has 
claimed a place in the lives of twenty-somethings as 
a sort of love guru.
Ansari speaks a lot to what relationships mean in 
the current day and how the process of dating has 
changed since he himself was in college. Ansari, 
now 32, discusses dating in the modern era with 
self deprecation, confusion, and with the goal of 
illustrating the challenges and changes presented to 
those who are trying to find love.
In Modern Romance, Ansari introduces the term 
“emerging adulthood” to describe the period in 
a person’s twenties in which they are exploring 
romantic options, while still developing as an 
individual. Ansari juxtaposes this period with the 
way the twenties were perceived back in the early 
to mid twentieth century, when marriage happened 
soon after high school and, more often than not, to 
an individual in the same neighborhood. Nowadays, 
people are bombarded with options with no clear life 
trajectory set up. Now, people often sift through a 
huge amount of people in their attempt to find their 
soulmate, instead of marrying a person they like for 
the opportunity and lifestyle it presents, and growing 
to love them more later.
While romantic comedies often portray a miracle 
ending to love, Ansari’s take on relationships deals 
with figuring out when to stop looking, or how to 
communicate through the noise of having too many 
options. This is why Master of None is set to be such 
an interesting, sentimental, and surely hilarious 
examination of love. As a person more than a little 
obsessed with love, and also social psychology, 
Ansari’s insights totally interest me and also scare 
me.
In the new trailer released last week, Ansari and a 
cast of characters, played by actors ranging from 
Noel Wells to Ansari’s own parents, all participate in 
the humor surrounding Ansari’s quest to figure out 
what he wants and then find it. The trailer includes 
a trip to a drugstore to buy some Plan B, discussions 
surrounding the difference in Instagram comments 
between genders, Ansari going to an audition where 
he is asked to demonstrate his talent with an Indian 
accent à la Ben Kingsley, and conversations about 
racism. One of the funniest parts of the trailer is 
Ansari’s conversation with his father, who talks 
about the problem he had with the first woman he 
considered romantically who he found too tall.
At one point, a friend asks Ansari’s character Dev 
to close his eyes and try to determine if he can see 
a future with a certain woman. Closing his eyes, 
Ansari answers “All I can see is black.” This seems 
to demonstrate that the show will take some light 
comic material and then reflect more deeply on it.
I often put people into two camps: those who 
embrace modern technology as wildly improving 
their lives but refuse to acknowledge the 
complications that it presents, and those who reject 
modern technology completely and don’t attempt to 
make it work for them. Ansari falls in the middle. He 
embraces the new technology that has made swiping 
through 50 potential matches in an hour possible, but 
is also quick to point out the way this is both great 
and terrible. His mission is to figure out how to make 
it less painstaking to use technology to find what you 
are looking for. Hopefully, with this awareness, those 
who find themselves in the “emerging adulthood” 
period can feel less lonely and understand the boat 
that they are in.
So far, Master of None has received overwhelmingly 
positive reviews from those who have seen the 
series ahead of its release. Both deadline.com and 
Entertainment Weekly have sung the show’s praises.
For anyone who has not watched Ansari’s 
ruminations on modern romance, I recommend 
watching some of his clips on Youtube. His stand 
up bits about explicit and uncalled for sexual 
text messages and his story about 50 Cent’s first 
grapefruit experience are great places to start. As 
a warning, Ansari does not deliver answers to the 
people. He does not have a secret recipe for success 
in love. But his theories and his observations and his 
sheer comedic talent make watching anything he 
does totally worth it.
Hopefully, this Friday, everyone will gain a little bit 
of wisdom while laughing uproariously at this semi-
autobiographical Netflix Original.
