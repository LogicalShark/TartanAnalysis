Hester Vanhomrigb, whom, he called “Vanessa” is portrayed as a’ witty, beautiful young .woman whose intense, passion for him led to coolness on his part and'event­ually, according to some, to her death of a broken heart.His association with these two women is contrasted by the authoi

. This week-end-Carnegie plays host 
to the Eastern Collegiate Swimming 
Association, in Its annual cham­
pionships. This event is rotated 
between the different schools in 
the association and 1935 Is Carnes 
gie’s first year as host to, the B. 
S. C. A. teams. .The races, which 
will begin on Friday afternoon, apd 
continue through Friday night and 
through Saturday afternoon, with
willthe finals on Saturday « 
probably beithe best ever seen at 
this school with some of the finest 
swimmers in the . Bast competing.
Among the colleges which are 
expected to send teams are Rut­
gers, Franklin and Marshall, Pitts­
burgh, Manhattan College, New 
York University, Ualversity of Del­
aware, and Lafayette with a possi­
bility that some of the other teams

Rutgers Won La6t Year 
Laot year the championships 
were won by the Rutgers squad, 
headed by Walter Spence, named 
by many as the greatest swimmer 
of the year. Carnegie . sent. only 
three representatives but managed 
to get fourth place out; of eleven 
entries when Boyer won- the back­stroke, Holiday came In second in the-220 yard' freestyle .event,' ánd the medley- temn of Boyer, .yonder Lancken. and Holiday placed third: H:?b?Scye^Jy»a. .ehowij iayph^mi, provéméñt in association llminga, so. the competition-wili probably be. Jrtener-'tiian ever,.;' ft is yery prob­able'that-almost every pool record wlli.be shattered, though league marks will próbábly stand, aB the Carnegie pool is rather Blow and difficult to swim In speed racing.
Favors F. & M.
The teams this year are much better balanced than on previous occasions and this should make the interesting. Rutgers
has shown startling strength in late' meets and may surprise the field with a victory. The events include the 400 yard relay, the 22p yard freestyle swim, fancy diving, fifty yard freestyle, 150 yard back­stroke, 440 yard freeptyle, 200 yard breaststroke, and the lOO^yard freestyle swim. . . .

i mHE rift between Student Council and Inter- X fraternity Council over the Intorfraternlty 
Formal was inevitable.
When Student Council assumed supervision 
< of the affair last year there were premonitions
1 on all sides that, sooner or later, Interfrater-
jiT;:;.:. til tv Council would make an attempt to : 
gain control of the dance. That attempt w 
¦.>;¦ d­ ) made last week.
But the regrettable tiling about the whole 
t situation is not that Interfraternity Council
•••'I made'a stand but that it chose to make it at
}<!•• bo unreasonable a Lime as it.did—just i
.. days before the dance. That is the SOURCE of 
all the trouble—that is why a breach, which 
might have been settled-ln a much smoother 
i r.j fashion, has assumed LARGER proportions
- .than it should. 
i,11 j' We do not contend that Interfraternlty 
tv-5- Council was unjustified in its demands to i 
I ' Its dance alone. Their arguments are good.
Is:» their reasons sound—but that is BESIDE THE
i i 4 POINT. Neither should we concern ourselves
fvT1' *3 -srtth the reason why Student Council look
oyer the affair last year. That, too, is beside 
It* ig .g— i ?; • •- the poir 
it >v * In this particular instance THIS, and this
U'ri* H*' alone, is the point. There is a ruling <
r books that slates that Student Council shall
_ exercise supervision over the Interfraternlty
jt 1 ' _ STUDENT COUNCIL MUST ENFORCE IT.
,-y £ That's all there is to consider.
^ sentiment has been expressed by mem- 
.bersof Student Council that they could see- 
i and understand • Interfraternlty .,.Council's 
..grievances and were willing to take actipn to'
> ' ’ .amend them, had interfraternlty Council be-
gun.Its action SOONER so that that ruling might 
j|l ' lave been rescinded in time for it to manage.
Hhie- dance itself. But aiuce Inlerfrateraity 
S v Council decided to act just a few days before
[ - the Ball while that ruling was STILL on the
'-books and despite the fact that Student Coun- 
;-;cii: had had control of the affair all along, that 
: action can only be characterized as a RASH 
'One, particularly in view of the fact that it 
-I-^''¿ame’after an agreement had supposedly, been 
{H ' i reached by the executive committees of both
I'!' s' , councils, and in view of the fact that Interfra-
1 temity Council had not conaulted its faculty
± adviser in the matter.
' 11 tToder such circumstances, it came as a di-
IU ' , ' rect CHALLENGE to Student Council, an Open
h DEFIANCE for it to do what it would, Inter-
i fraternity Council intended to act independ-
!n spite of Student Council. And Stu- 
CHddtA did and will continue to do what 
-'."it' jiUST do—enforce the rules as they 6tand-r 
•' there is*no other alternative;
If w®. will have strong government, then 
rthit government must perform its prime duty, 
i ^ l enforce the rules. If it fails to do that, then

Some­times in the evening when the shadows very long, Mevi would notice how

Ooe day when-he was walking down the now crowded street of the island, Mevl no­ticed a yellow man with slanting eyes sit­ting in. the doorway, of a little house fac­ing the wide blue bay.

1932.
Bonus and Legion Got Start in 1919 
The whole question of the boi might be said to have begun with the formation of the American Le­gion in 1919, one of whose pur­poses, in addition to supporting ~ constitution, law, order, peace, and freedom, was to be "a devotion to mutual helpfulness.” The legion- aires took this last clause ously that within a year, according to Henry Goddard Leach of the Forum, it was able to boast:
"The Legion is uot ashamed of the record of its committee (Legis­lative) - - -
Congress in
the SpanishAmerlcan vet­erans in ten.”
A DollaiBy 1924 the Legion representa­tives In Washington had become so skilled in the devices of the lobbyist that Congress was led to believe that veterans "who stood by their country in time of stress’* were entitled to at least a dollar a day. more for their services. This sum amounting to nearly four bil­lions was to be payable in 20 years, and to make the move eound less like robbing the treas­ury, the bonus was labeled. "ad­justed compensation.” The act
by President Coolldge, but gressmen, flooded with letters from their legionary constituents, for­got their real duty to the people and passed the bill over the Presi­dent’s veto.
'agcu-b; its
_4. 50 per cent on the fa*tralue of their “adjusted ceri«L cates." This move, -takers vantage of by nearly three wiiC veterans, left the treasury in v- red a.trifling $1,500,00.0..New Bill- Pending.Now after 14 years* rolling ihft “snowball of veteran legislation®' has reached such dimension there seems to be nothing atwhi„i. it hestitates. The -tact that iS bonus is not due until 1945 ^ the fact that the treasury eannoi stand ever-increasing, 
to make little difference, and it Jn probably be .within the ne:
weeks that actlon’ upon a- aeiv tet erans’ bill embodying the subglanc« of the Miami resolution wuj v! pending in Congress. This mean, if interest on the boiroweT portion is not charged, a cash m<i lay of 52,600,000. •
It seems a little strange that go small a portion of the population should feel justified in demandin' this enormous sum as its aban of government relief money wW the work relief funds for the whole country amounts to only $1,400 004
The danger Jd the situation ii not that this particular expenditure will wreck . the country, but as many able critics have pointed oui that'the same arguments that wii apply to this appropriation can inter be used again for still larger appropriations. Already 24 cent on the national income goes into pensions, bonuses, hospiui care, etc., for veterans of past nan and as 1914 recedes into the past there seems to be little doubt tbal this percentage will Increase Senators Can Hardly Ignor Legion Lobby
Senators and representatiiej can hardly ignore the potferiti American Legion lobby vhldi threatens them with “if you doni vote for the bonus, the man who fills your place next fall will." As one young congressman said be- iore voting for the veteran loan bill In 1932, “This is a $10,000 job and they don’t »grow on bushes ihla year, ive got to keep my job."With congressmen taking ibis attitude and with this veterans' lobby back of which are a million men who feel thdi the countrj owes th^m a limitless debt, ties nation takes & really serious tut Why, as President Roosevelt n- cently said, should any person "be­cause he wore a uniform ... be placed in a special class of beoe-

Is Germany Civilized?
The world was shocked by the 
hratallty of the blood purge of 
last summer la Germany,, and 
less than a year later, news 
more harrowing event which Ban

received. The Incident in ques­
tion is- tbe recent execution of the 
two women who were accused of 
being spies.
¦ Regardless of tbe angle Ircai 
which the case- la reviewed, no 
“matter what the legalistic justifies 
\ lion for the beheading of these 
women may be, the fact still re* 
wains that their execution cannot be denuded of its horrifying bru­tality. It will go down in -history as. a blemish on the face of the Nazi movement and take its placo alongside the spectacular purge of ay ear ago.
It was thought at that Ume that Hitler would profit by the deluge
Fuehrer places little value on tbe sentiment of the outside world, for. bad he been able io see beyond tbe extremities of his. own nose, he might have been chivalrous enough to have mitigated the sen­tence to -life imprisonment. At .least he could hava commuted it in such a manner as to be less bar- -baric than tbe spectacle-juBt en­acted In Berlin.
