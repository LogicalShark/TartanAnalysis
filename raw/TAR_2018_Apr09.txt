Hamilton’s Leslie Odom Jr. talks new book and time at CMU
VALENE MEZMIN
Editor-in-Chief
There are certain 
Carnegie Mellon alumni 
whose names are repeated 
on tours of campus, line the 
walls of buildings, and are 
spoken with a certain de-
gree of reverence as if their 
degree of talent and success 
could somehow be shared 
with current students. One 
of these alums is actor Leslie 
Odom Jr., best known for his 
Tony-award winning role 
as Aaron Burr in Hamilton, 
who was most recently seen 
in the ?lm adaptation of 
Agatha Christie’s Murder on 
the Orient Express, and has 
recently released his ?rst 
book. Failing Up: How to 
Take Risks, Aim Higher, and 
Never Stop Learning follows 
Odom’s life, from his child-
hood in Philadelphia, to his 
experiences as a musical 
theater major at Carnegie 
Mellon University, and of 
course delves into his career 
on Broadway.
Although Odom initially 
found the task of writing a 
book to be daunting, he told 
The Tartan that he began to 
warm up to the idea when 
publishers proposed that 
he write it in the form of a 
commencement address.
“Because of the 
educational nature of 
Hamilton, people were in-
terested in what I thought 
about education, especially 
arts education,” says Odom, 
which led him to a series of 
speaking tours after leav-
ing the show. Because of 
this experience, he found 
that writing a book in the 
same sort of format would 
be more freeing while al-
lowing him to “offer a little 
bit of inspiration and a 
little bit of hope to the next 
generation.”
Odom decided to title 
the book Failing Up as a ref-
erence to the lessons that 
you learn through life’s 
struggles. “A turning point 
in my life as a young artist 
was when I gave myself the 
permission to fail,” he says, 
realizing that “it was really 
only up from there.”
While Odom initially 
envisioned his audience sit-
ting before him in caps and 
gowns, he started to broad-
en this view with the guide 
of the many forms of gradu-
ations he has experienced 
since his own at Carnegie 
Mellon.
“The day you graduate 
college, it can feel like the 
end of something, but re-
ally it’s the beginning of 
something,” he says. “I 
graduated into my thir-
ties. I graduated into my 
?rst serious relationship. I 
graduated into fatherhood. 
Leaving Hamilton, in a lot 
of ways, felt like a gradu-
ation. On the day of your 
college graduation, there 
are so many moments to 
look forward to.”
With the numerous 
amount of projects that 
Odom was taking on, The 
Tartan asked him how he 
managed to ?nd time to 
write Failing Up.
“It was not easy,” he 
laughs. “My plan was, 
somewhere around the 
holiday time, I’d rent a cab-
in, I’d take my family into 
the woods for the winter 
and I’d write my book.” As 
winter approached, Odom 
was contacted by director 
Kenneth Branaugh to be 
part of Murder on the Orient 
Express which shot from 
late October to February. 
In April, his daughter Lucy, 
the eventual focus of the 
last chapter of his book, was 
born and the winter was 
over.
Eventually, Odom says 
that he just wrote whenever 
he could ?nd the time. “If 
I had a six-hour ?ight, I’d 
power up on espresso and 
write.” He used the energy 
he had after concerts to 
?t in another three to four 
hours. Although it wasn’t 
easy, Odom still values the 
experience. “I enjoyed it so 
much, I’m already thinking 
about next year,” he says. “I 
want to make sure now that 
I make the time in my life

San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz visits for Energy Week
EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
San Juan mayor Carmen 
Yulin Cruz Soto was in 
Pittsburgh this week for 
Carnegie Mellon’s Energy 
Week, a three-day sympo-
sium consisting of career 
fairs, lectures, forums, and 
?eld trips.
These events included a 
student-only lecture Cruz, 
who graduated from Heinz 
College in 1986, gave to a 
packed room in Hamburg 
Hall. She became well-
known in the days after 
Hurricane Maria for her 
outspokenness on national 
media pleading for more 
help for Puerto Rico — 
which made her a target of 
President Trump’s Twitter 
attacks. In the lecture, she 
recounted stories she wit-
nessed during the aftermath 
of Hurricane Maria and im-
plored the audience to stand 
up for what they believe in 
and use the problem-solving 
skills they learn at Carnegie 
Mellon to make a difference 
for others.
Describing the situation 
in her city and much of the 
island in the weeks after 
Hurricane Maria, she told 
the audience “just imagine 
having no cell phones” — or 
at least, that the cell phones 
were useless except for tak-
ing pictures and writing 
notes. There was no electric-
ity, communication, food, 
clean water, or medicine for 
six weeks.
In the post-Maria weeks, 
being a mayor in Puerto 
Rico included jobs such as 
pulling people out of ?ood-
water infused with fecal 
matter at 4:57 a.m. Once, 
about two weeks after the 
storm hit, she saw a baby, 
who reached for the water 
bottle the mayor was hold-
ing because the baby was so 
desperate for a drink. She 
still gets tears in her eyes 
when she remembers the 
desperation that ?lled her 
city and the island at large. 
Recalling the devastation, 
she said, “I’ve seen people 
die because they don’t have 
medication; I’ve seen people 
dehydrated because people 
couldn’t reach them.” She 
insisted that it is not the 
smiles of the people she was 
able to help that stick to her; 
it is the desperate voices of 
those she couldn’t help that 
haunt her.
For many Puerto Ricans, 
help took too long to ar-
rive; FEMA told her to be 
patient and go online to get 
help, which was rendered 
impossible by the fact that 
most of Puerto Rico had no 
power or communications 
at that time. Cruz found 
that President Trump’s 
tweets and comments didn’t 
help with the absurdity of 
the situation. She stated 
that “common sense is the 
least common of the senses 
in government” and that 
“we’re an island surrounded 
by lots of ocean water — 
someone said that once and 
we didn’t know until he said 
it,” in an apparent sarcastic 
reference to the President’s 
comments that it was hard 
to help Puerto Rico be-
cause there is lots of water 
around an island. The room 
erupted in laughter at these 
comments.
Critics claimed that she 
was trying to be political 
during the crisis; she coun-
tered that this was about 
saving lives. “Right now, 
about 100,000 people don’t 
have air conditioning,” she 
said, referring to the rough-
ly ?ve percent of island-
ers who still had no power, 
nearly seven months after 
Maria. “But, we don’t want 
power to have air condition-
ing. We want power so that 
we don’t have to use the 
light in our cell phones to 
operate on people. We want 
power so that we don’t have 
schools operating part time 
because they don’t have 
power.”
Faced with the 
overwhelming emergency, 
she and her administration 
broke the problem into small 
pieces — how to get food 
and water to people, how 
to keep insulin cold, how 
to keep breast milk fresh 
— which matched with the 
problem-solving culture at

SOCIAL ACTION CALENDAR 
BENJAMIN JOHNSON-STRAUB
Special to The Tartan
In October, we published 
an article expressing our 
concern at the lack of 
student involvement with 
the consideration of pro-
posed changes to the course 
drop and withdrawal dead-
lines. Six months later, we 
are happy to report that 
both the new policy and 
the process that got us to 
that new policy have shown 
great improvement.
Starting next fall, the 
drop period will be six 
weeks long rather than two. 
A system of vouchers will 
be introduced allowing un-
dergraduates to drop any 
course up to the last day 
of classes three times dur-
ing their academic career. 
A robust evaluation plan is 
being developed to ensure 
that when the new policies 
are evaluated in two years, 
future changes to the drop 
and withdrawal period will 
be bene?cial to students and 
faculty.
This new policy is the 
result of a decision on the 
part of the Task Force for 
the CMU Experience and 
Provost Laurie Weingart to 
engage meaningfully with 
student and faculty elected 
bodies. Faculty Senate, 
Undergraduate Student 
Senate, and the Graduate 
Student Assembly all had 
valuable input to give the 
Task Force which had not 
been heard in previous 
discussions.
Most importantly, 
however, the involved 
members of the Task Force 
showed a willingness to iter-
ate on the proposed Drop/
Withdraw policy until we 
found a policy that was 
acceptable to everyone 
involved. This is in contrast 
to a dynamic in which stu-
dents provide information 
or opinions to the univer-
sity and are not consulted 
again until a decision has 
already been made. We 
hope that the interactive 
process of crafting the new 
Drop/Withdraw policy 
will serve as a precedent 
for many more productive 
collaborations in policy-
making between the univer-
sity administration and its 
students.

Dr. Cranor, head of privacy lab, on impact of CUPS research
ADAM TUNNARD
Staffwriter
The revelation 
that Facebook may 
have passed on the 
data of as many as 
87 million users to 
Cambridge Analytica 
has brought the issue 
of privacy online to 
the forefront of the 
public consciousness. 
Consumers are asking 
who has their data, 
where their personal 
information may have 
been distributed, 
and how their inter-
ests fit into a busi-
ness model where 
the product is their 
own data. Carnegie 
Mellon’s CyLab Usable 
Privacy and Security 
Laboratory, or CUPS, 
has been researching 
these issues since its 
foundation.
According to their 
website, the lab focuses 
their research on three 
distinct aspects of secu-
rity systems, “building 
systems that 'just work' 
without involving humans 
in security-critical func-
tions; making secure sys-
tems intuitive and easy to 
use; and teaching humans 
how to perform security-
critical tasks.”
This type of research is 
imperative in the world in 
which we live: security sys-
tems have never had more 
of an impact than they do 
now. The complex nature 
of privacy in the era of the 
internet brings together 
PhD candidates, masters 
students, and other re-
searchers across a variety 
of disciplines including, 
but not limited to, societal 
computing, engineering 
and public policy, 
human-computer interac-
tion, computer science, 
electrical and computer 
engineering, and public 
policy and management.
The Tartan spoke to 
the founder and direc-
tor of the laboratory, Dr. 
Lorrie Faith Cranor, who 
also serves as a professor 
of computer science and 
engineering and public 
policy, as well as associate 
department head of engi-
neering and public policy. 
She started the lab in 2004 
“shortly after [becom-
ing] a faculty member at 
Carnegie Mellon” and has 
“been the director from 
the beginning.”
She explains that 
privacy and security 
applications need to be less 
"hands on" for humans, as 
“any time humans have to 
remember to do something 
or pay attention, there is a 
risk that they won’t.” She 
continues, “for example, 
when web browsers pop 
up security warnings, 
humans tend to just swat 
them away without pay-
ing attention.” A more se-
cure and usable browser or 
system would handle the 
security threat accurately 
and without human inter-
action, which is a great 
example of what the lab 
researches and develops.
Some examples of 
published CUPS research 
in the past include a 
Joshua Tan, et al. paper 
titled “Can Unicorns Help 
Users Compare Crypto Key 
Fingerprints?” from 2017, a 
Lorrie Cranor, et al. paper 
titled “Teaching Usable 
Privacy and Security: A 
guide for instructors” 
from 2007, and an Aleecia 
McDonald, et al. paper 
titled “How Technology 
Drives Vehicular Privacy” 
from 2006.
These diverse 
publications, covering 
multiple facets of science, 
technology, and policy, 
allow the laboratory to 
have a broad impact in 
the world of privacy and 
security systems. Dr. 
Cranor elaborated on 
this by mentioning just 
a few instances of the 
laboratory’s impact.
“In 2008 we started 
a company based on our 
research into anti-phish-
ing training," Dr. Cranor 
explained. "That company, 
Wombat Security, was pur-
chased by Proofpoint for 
$2.25 million in March 
2018. It is now a leading 
supplier of security aware-
ness training services to 
companies and organiza-
tions around the world.”
Furthermore, Dr. 
Cranor stated that 
“Microsoft Internet 
Explorer phishing warn-
ings were improved based 
on [our] research” and 
that “Facebook imple-
mented privacy nudges to 
remind people to adjust 
their settings based on 
[our] research.” Also, Dr. 
Cranor “started the Sym-
posium on Usable Privacy 
and Security (SOUPS),” 
which is now “in its 
14th year and run by the 
USENIX Association.”
While no papers 
have been published 
this year, one that 
is currently be-
ing worked on is 
something that a lot 
of Carnegie Mellon 
students and faculty 
are stakehold-
ers in. Titled “‘It's 
not actually that 
horrible’: Exploring 
Adoption of Two-
Factor Authentication 
at a University,” the 
paper looks into 
Carnegie Mellon 
University's use of 
Duo Mobile login 
authentication. It 
will be presented at 
the 2018 Conference 
on Human Factors in 
Computing Systems 
later this month.
In addition to this, Dr. 
Cranor commented that a 
“paper on how people use 
private browsing modes in 
web browsers” and “a study 
of what people draw when 
asked to draw pictures of 
privacy” are currently in 
the works.
Issues relating to 
privacy and security sys-
tems are only becoming 
more central to global 
technology conversations, 
with corporations and gov-
ernments constantly in the 
news for privacy and secu-
rity violations. As consum-
ers may become more wary 
about their presence on the 
internet, the work that the 
CUPS laboratory does will 
likely become more auspi-
cious.  Although privacy 
policy is currently deter-
mined on the supply side, 
it is possible that demand 
will shift in the wake of 
these scandals, and more 
attention will be paid to the 
work of the CUPS lab. 
to have this kind of creative 
outlet for myself always.”
Odom graduated 
from Carnegie Mellon 
University’s School of 
Drama in 2003. He dedi-
cates his book to his teach-
ers, the many people who 
have served as mentors to 
him throughout his life. 
In the book, he discusses 
his relationship with voice 
coach Professor Thomas 
Douglas and cites his dance 
teacher Professor Judy 
Conte as someone who 
was “really important and 
special to me.”
The Tartan asked, 
considering the recent dia-
logue that has surrounded 
mental health at the School 
of Drama, how Odom makes 
time to take care of his own 
mental health, to which 
Odom credited the art form 
with being a meditative and 
therapeutic aspect in itself.
“As you work on the 
issues that are holding you 
back in your work, it frees 
you up in your life as well, 
and vice-versa,” he says. 
“When you choose to really 
devote yourself to a life in 
the theater, a life as an art-
ist, it comes with challenges 
for sure, but there is sort 
of a built in therapy aspect 
because there is so much 
self-analyzation. We spend 
our time dealing with em-
pathy, we spend our time 
dealing with humanity and 
human foibles, and so you 
can allow time to keep an 
eye on those things in your 
life as you work on them on 
stage.”
For those moments 
where you can’t push 
through closed doors and 
are facing personal limita-
tions that you can’t reach 
beyond, Odom states that 
“in those times, it helps to 
have a real spiritual practice 
to deal with that.”
On April 27, Odom can 
be seen in his ?rst televised 
concert on PBS as part 
of their Live from Lincoln 
Center series. Odom calls 
the hour-long performance 
a “half diary journal entry, 
half concert,” where he 
performs songs from his 
albums and others he calls 
some of his “favorite songs 
on the planet.”
“We really married the 
music and the song choices 
with a deeper look into 
what life has been like for 
me over the past year since 
the Hamilton phenome-
non,” says Odom. “It was a 
really big deal for me…I’m 
really proud of the concert 
special.”
As for future projects, 
Odom can soon be seen 
starring alongside Freida 
Pinto in Only from writer-
director Takashi Doscher 
and in the as-yet untitled 
feature ?lm directorial 
debut from Sia.
Carnegie Mellon that she 
often praised throughout 
the speech. The island had 
to completely rethink all 
procedures: “We can’t think 
out of the box because we 
have no box.” In this spirit, 
she unfolded what looked 
to be a small plastic pouch 
in her hand, which turned 
out to be a solar lamp that 
could ?ash (to signal SOS 
without using one’s voice) 
or function as a regular 
lamp that students could 
use to study when they were 
without power. She insisted 
that “technology must have 
a heart.”
A theme of the lecture 
was the hope that was in-
spired in her when she saw 
people helping each other, 
not just in Puerto Rico but 
also gestures of goodwill 
toward the island from 
complete strangers on the 
mainland. Cruz recounted 
the story of how one day in 
November, she received a 
postcard from someone in 
Ohio, with a one-dollar bill 
attached. Soon, she started 
getting other postcards 
with small amounts of cash 
attached to them, and ?nally 
packages from Amazon 
with solar components from 
strangers who wanted to 
help, including some from 
Texas, which had just been 
hit by Hurricane Harvey. 
Her heart surged with hope. 
“When others had failed, 
you hadn’t,” she said, her 
voice choked with emotion. 
“You saved lives because 
you gave us hope.”
A point she frequently 
reiterated throughout her 
speech was that we need to 
be fearless and unapologetic 
when standing up for what 
we believe in, although she 
clari?ed her point by saying 
to make sure that what we 
believe in is actually good 
for the majority of people. 
“Make sure you don’t let 
anybody, no matter the 
color of the house they live 
in, tell you that you don’t 
have the right to speak up. 
Or the address,” she told the 
audience, referring to the 
President again.
She implored the 
student audience to go out 
and make a difference in the 
world. “Don’t ever forget 
that you’re blessed to be 
educated in one of the ?nest 
institutions [in the world],” 
she said. Although one 
cannot possibly help every 
person, one should never 
let someone go without 
help because one didn’t try 
his or her best, or because 
one looked the other way. 
It may seem overwhelming, 
but she said, “change it one 
step at a time.” She asserted 
in her speech that we owe it 
to the world, to Pittsburgh, 
and most of all to ourselves, 
to do good.

ly owns and for the last couple 
of weeks, has been the subject of 
many local news stories. Though 
Sinclair’s broad reach into the 
television-viewing households 
of America has not exactly ?own 
under the radar, with many news 
outlets covering Sinclair’s acqui-
sitions of outlets and struggles 
with regulators, it took a video 
published by Deadspin to make 
this issue really become part of 
the public consciousness.
The video depicted anchors 
from forty different news out-
lets reciting the script that had 
been handed down by Sinclair. 
Timothy Burke of Deadspin over-
laid the dozens of news anchors 
all repeating the same message: 
the media is biased, and you 
should be on the lookout for 
journalists who push their own 
agendas through their work. The 
effect of the myriad of outlets 
making the same statement all at 
once was chilling and led many, 
including late night host Jimmy 
Kimmel, to bemoan Sinclair’s 
effect on democracy.
This is not the only instance 
where Sinclair has required that 
the news stations run their own 
particular content. While, ac-
cording to The Washington Post, 
most “must-runs” from broadcast 
groups are meant to promote sta-
tion content, Sinclair makes sta-
tions run segments like commen-
tary from former Trump advisor 
Boris Epshteyn, or their daily 
“Terrorism Watch Desk.”
While dystopian-looking vi-
suals of this particular Sinclair 
must-run were indeed disturb-
ing, the real insidious nature of 
Sinclair’s effect on the minds of 
the public comes not from this 
speci?c must-run, but from 
their overall effect on local 
news.
A recent study by 
Gregory J. Martin and 
Josh McCrain of Emory 
University examined 
the effects of a Sinclair 
acquisition on the local 
station being acquired. 
They found that vocabu-
lary of news coverage 
became more 
similar 
to the 
lexicon of 
rightward 
rhetoric, and 
that news 
covered more 
national politics 
at the expense of local 
issues.
Local TV stations are 
one of the few remain-
ing bastions of local jour-
nalism, with a Pew study 
showing that 37 percent 
of Americans use local 
news as a news source — a 
far larger share than cable 
news. Americans return to 
local news because the news 
covered pertains to their 
immediate community and 
comes from local ?gures 
they know and trust. Since 
local newspapers are on the 
decline, it is actively detri-
mental that these trusted 
local news sources are 
shifted away from vital lo-
cal coverage to national, 
partisan issues, and 
that the voices and 
faces of the anchors 
they trust are used to promote a 
partisan agenda — even if it is 
labeled as editorial.
Journalists from a Sinclair-run 
news station found, in a piece 
they wrote anonymously for Vox 
to avoid losing their jobs, that the 
must-run content felt contrary to 
their journalistic mission. “We 
hated the way the PSA bashed 
other news outlets and the way it 
insinuated that we were the only 
truthful news source — despite 
the rightward tilt our network 
has taken over the years. Our an-
chors privately said they felt like 
corporate mouthpieces, especial-
ly when they found out no edits 
of the script were permitted. Yet 
bosses made it clear that reading 
the message wasn’t a suggestion 
but an order from above.”
A general distrust in “the me-
dia” harms all news outlets as 
consumers will deem reputable, 
well-sourced journalism biased. 
These Sinclair journalists un-
derstood that, in making these 
general attacks the “PSA” was at-
tempting to lower public trust in 
the media.
The pro-Trump slant of the 
must-run pieces that Sinclair 
forces on broadcast stations has 
led to accusations stating the up-
roar around Sinclair’s editorial 
content arose solely due to the 
side of the political spectrum that 
it fell on. However, the problem 
with Sinclair stations is twofold: 
namely, that they have been al-
lowed to hold such an unprec-
edented percent of the American 
television news market, and that 
they have used that share to push 
their ideals, even at the expense 
of the viewership of the stations 
they own, as the Emory study 
holds that viewership declines at 
Sinclair-owned stations.
On the issue of promoting a 
partisan platform, Sinclair pro-
tested in an internal memo that 
their editorial content is clearly 
labeled as commentary, and fur-
ther argued that people were 
“upset about our well-researched 
journalistic initiative focused 
on fair and objective reporting” 
meant to highlight stories like 
Pizzagate that were entirely un-
moored from the realm of fact. 
However, their statement in the 
must-run that “unfortunately, 
some members of the media use 
their platforms to push their own 
personal bias and agenda to con-
trol ‘exactly what people think’” 
made no reference to speci?c 
stories, instead choosing to push 
broad distrust in the media. Fur-
thermore, using the local anchors 
to promote their statement made 
the editorial content, however 
clearly labeled, hard to distin-
guish from the news.
It would be impossible to levy 
a critique at the partisan impact 
of Sinclair’s content without 
also critiquing the mechanisms 
that made it possible, namely, 
the increased consolidation of 
media. If their deal to acquire 
Tribune Media succeeds, Sinclair 
will be able to access around 70 
percent of American TV owning 
households. This deal is pend-
ing the approval of the Federal 
Communications Commission 
(FCC) and the Department of 
Justice, and is coupled with an 
internal investigation in the FCC 
to see if the chairman, Ajit Pai, 
improperly coordinated with 
Sinclair when he loosened regu-
lations around the acquisition 
of news stations.
This deal is expected to 
be approved by the FCC, 
and President Trump 
himself stepped in to de-
fend Sinclair af-
ter the must-
run scandal, 
stating on 
Twitter, 
“The Fake 
News Net-
works, those that 
knowingly have a sick 
and biased AGENDA, 
are worried about 
the competition 
and quality 
of Sinclair 
Broadcast.” 
This state-
ment harshly 
contrasts Presi-
dent Trump’s claim 
that Amazon is cheating 
the taxpayer by under-
paying the Post Of?ce for 
package shipping due to 
the negative coverage 
he has received in The 
Washington Post, which 
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos 
owns. Negative coverage of the 
Trump administration means that 
Trump will push for policies that 
harm companies af?liated with 
the news organization. Positive 
coverage, however, will lead to 
a loosening of regulation by the 
Trump administration.
This is the means through 
which the partisan content and 
the consolidation intersect: par-
tisan content can be pushed 
through the large platform that 
large acquisitions afford, and that 
partisan coverage means the ex-
ecutive branch will allow these 
acquisitions to go forward.Connor McGaf?n/Staff Artist

Robots will take away from human interaction   
NINA NELLY KOWALEWSKI
The technology in our 
world is constantly evolving 
to become less and less de-
pendent on humans and more 
and more automatic. You’ve 
definitely seen it just from the 
increase in self-checkout reg-
isters at your local supermar-
ket. Have you ever considered 
a world in which there are no 
more cashiers and your trip to 
buy some milk is devoid of any 
human interaction? Or where 
most of interaction with any-
thing came from with that of a 
humanoid robot? No more chit-
chatting with a friendly cashier 
from whom you can learn how 
often the items you buy go on 
sale or receive thirty-second 
life advice from!
As our world becomes more 
and more efficient, we seem to 
be trying to replace people with 
robots in jobs that are ranked 
as relatively simple, meaning 
at a level that robots could do 
with no potentially huge risk 
for them messing up. Since ro-
bots do not take lunch or bath-
room breaks and do not get 
distracted by a surly or attrac-
tive coworker, they have hiked 
up factory productions and in-
creased revenue. Maybe they 
need periodic maintenance to 
tighten some loose screws, but 
they do not require health ben-
efits, retirement plans, vaca-
tion, or a sick leave. Thus, they 
are a solid investment.
As we develop increasingly 
more sophisticated robots, 
they are being programmed 
to engage in more and more 
complex interactions with hu-
man beings. A voice recogni-
tion system enables robots to 
choose a musical piece by our 
favorite composer or a per-
former, make a phone call for 
us while we are driving, or find 
the nearest restaurant or gas 
station. Life is becoming easier 
and driving is becoming safer 
with the help of artificial in-
telligence. It seems that robots 
can improve our quality of life 
in every respect.
However, one needs to won-
der if developing humanoid 
robots to aid the elderly or to 
serve as disabled care compan-
ions should be met with the 
same enthusiasm and brouha-
ha as we display when receiv-
ing a roomba as a gift. With-
out a doubt, robots can help 
the elderly and disabled to re-
ceive medication, have items 
delivered to their bedside, or 
to receive reminders about 
doctors’ visits. It seems that 
in this role, the robots are ef-
ficient and practical. However, 
if the ones in care of the robots 
have mostly machines as their 
companions, they are deprived 
of true human interaction. No 
matter how sophisticated ro-
bots are, or how much they are 
designed to look like humans, 
they cannot display emotion 
and provide a human touch. 
Being subjected to long-term 
companionship of robots ap-
pears dehumanizing to those 
who must depend on the 
robots’ care. It is a prescription 
for loneliness and depression. 
As a society, we cannot afford 
going that route — we haven’t 
designed robots who can assist 
with lifting depression yet!
As short-term assistants, 
robots may be a solution 
and a way to make in-home 
care affordable. It may be 
the best option for someone 
wheelchair- bound and strug-
gling to take care of oneself, 
but without any relatives or 
friends who might be willing 
to help. Perhaps a person may 
want to retain independence or 
simply can’t afford to move in 
to a care home? Then hiring or 
purchasing a humanoid robot 
to assist and serve as a compan-
ion in your daily life to make 
tasks easier and increase your 
quality of life. In the future, 
this may even end up being a 
cheaper alternative than hiring 
an actual person as an assis-
tant. But, it’s a little bit freaky 
when you think about it — 
imagine having to spend your 
entire day talking to someone 
who can’t even feel anything! 
Relying entirely on a robot in 
this way takes away the as-
pect of human interaction and 
companionship, important fac-
tors for establishing emotional 
connections for most people. 
And, if your life is void of emo-
tional connection, what do you 
have?
As humans, we are, by 
nature, largely social creatures. 
In order to be happy, we need to 
maintain some sort of balance 
with human interaction during 
our daily lives. Depriving some-
one of it deliberately for the 
sake of cheaper “labor” is sim-
ply inhumane and takes away 
that person’s dignity. Some 
argue that robots could be de-
veloped to be social with an in-
creased range in flexible facial 
expressions. However, human 
companionship itself is utterly 
irreplaceable, and I would ar-
gue that the realization that 
you are talking to an empty 
machine that will never truly 
be able to love you nor laugh 
at your jokes on a meaningful 
level is more lonely and isolat-
ing than spending all of that 
time by yourself. Not to men-
tion the fact that robots will 
do what they are programmed 
for, and so far there is no algo-
rithm that can be used to pro-
gram for creative and nuanced 
use of language that can feed 
both our souls and our brains. 
Robots can feed our bodies 
by bringing us food, drink, or 
medication. But, a long-term 
dependence on a robot’s com-
panionship equals deprivation 
of what makes us human — 
the creative use of language 
to express novel thoughts, to 
make us laugh and cry. In a 
sense, being locked up with a 
robot for days on end may be 
compared to being locked up 
in a solitary confinement. Isn’t 
that the hardest prison sen-
tence? If we do not invest in 
creating affordable social care 
for the elderly and the disabled 
and we make robots the only 
option of companionship they 
can afford, we will be sentenc-
ing them to a life of solitude 
in the presence of advanced 
technology.

From painting the fence to 
participating in buggy, Carnegie 
Mellon’s traditions take many 
forms, and adding the notorious 
15-112 (hereafter referred to as 
112) and Concepts of Mathemat-
ics (referred to as Concepts) to 
your academic resume is a tra-
dition every student is quickly 
introduced to when first arriv-
ing at Carnegie Mellon. Despite 
the two courses falling under 
the School of Computer Science, 
they are understood across near-
ly every college to be a vitally 
defining aspect of the university 
experience that feeds well into 
the “interdisciplinary” academ-
ics Carnegie Mellon advertises. 
But, how can we make this in-
terdisciplinary emphasis expand 
past the realm of computing? 
And why are 112 and Concepts 
the only classes that seem to 
garner interest across the entire-
ty of our campus?
Since its inception, Carnegie 
Mellon found its niche in tech-
nology, being aptly named 
Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology (CIT) as early as 
1912. After the merging 
of CIT and the Mellon 
Institute, the univer-
sity grew exponen-
tially; however the 
focus remained on 
science, technol-
ogy, engineering, 
and mathematics 
(STEM), creating 
a reputation for the 
school that remains 
today.
15-112: The Fundamentals of 
Programming and Computer Sci-
ence has become a stereotype of 
the Carnegie Mellon experience. 
Every year, the 112 lecture hall 
fills to the brim with students 
of varying backgrounds and de-
grees, regardless of whether the 
course applies to their individ-
ual practices. 21-127: Concepts 
of Mathematics holds a similar 
reputation, and, when brought 
up on campus, these two courses 
are referred to as cultural rites 
of passage within the communi-
ty. While both 112 and Concepts 
are infamously demanding and 
time intensive courses, students 
flock to their doors regardless as 
a result of the significance as-
signed to them within the cam-
pus culture. To many students, 
not taking 
either of these classes seems 
stranger than going out of your 
way to do so, and despite this 
sounding like a positive moti-
vational force in theory, it also 
results in creating a stress cul-
ture that upholds STEM abilities 
above others.
It is no surprise that the gen-
eral emphasis on STEM over 
other disciplines has tainted 
our own university culture. The 
continuous push towards STEM 
fields is intensified as a conse-
quence of the stereotypes and 
insecurities attributed to the 
Arts, and as scientific progress 
and tech jobs continue to mark 
a large portion of our global 
conversation, it becomes diffi-
cult to dispel these beliefs and 
convince students to give other 
disciplines their equal respect. 
These concerns become a part 
of the academic hierarchy as 
generations of students seek to 
join fields they believe will sup-
ply them success, further en-
graining the stereotypes into the 
institutions they attend.
But, what makes Carnegie 
Mellon so partial to this prob-
lem? The Carnegie Mellon 
mindset has 
long been founded on a STEM 
emphasis that supersedes that of 
other studies — a mindset that 
is due to change. Programming, 
in many ways, is presented as 
a valuable life skill regardless 
of whether it aligns with a stu-
dent’s personal pursuits, equat-
ing it to something as essential 
as learning to write. This assigns 
an inherent merit to taking 112 
and Concepts — a merit that 
does not extend to other classes 
outside of the computing field. 
As the other colleges continue 
to grow, expand, and succeed, 
much of the student body finds 
itself at odds with these perspec-
tives. Through the introduction 
of newer programs, such as BXA, 
that focus specifically on creat-
ing cross-disciplinary degrees 
and academic opportunities, the 
Carnegie Mellon culture has be-
gun to embrace the idea that in-
terdisciplinary practices across 
all of the colleges can be equally 
valuable.
The student interest in 112 or 
Concepts was never the issue it-
self; the problem is in how this 
attitude does not expand be-
yond these two classes, in turn 
influencing the way students 
navigate both their aca-
demic and professional 
careers. There is space 
to give credit to these 
classes while at the 
same time acknowl-
edging the worth 
of classes that fall 
under other disci-
plines. By introduc-
ing other courses as 
essential parts of the 
university identity, 
the power of classes like 
112 and Concepts can be given 
to them equally, providing an 
inclusive, holistic education.
Studios should “pull a Christopher Plummer” on racist content
Surpassing the hype: the power of 112 and Concepts

Last Thursday, I saw 
performances by artists from 
1HoodMedia, a group of black 
musicians and activists who 
use their platform to speak out 
about current political and so-
cial injustices in order to spread 
awareness and invoke action. 
One of the most prominent lines 
from the set came from rapper 
LiveFromTheCity, who opened 
the show by performing his song 
“Black Girl Magic,” a song that 
praises black women and their 
beauty. After the song, he talked 
about how the best way to repre-
sent marginalized voices was to 
“give them the mic” before hap-
pily passing said mic to fellow 
1HoodMedia artist, and black 
woman, Jacquea Mae.
This statement could not pos-
sibly be truer in our current pop 
culture climate where represen-
tation is becoming more and 
more important, as shown by 
events such as the astounding 
success of Black Panther (which 
is now Marvel Studios’ highest-
grossing domestic movie) and 
the heightened importance of 
women due to the #TimesUp and 
#MeToo movements. The only 
way to further this momentum is 
by supporting through your dol-
lar, going out to support content 
created by these marginalized 
voices. The biggest indicator of 
a film’s performance to a studio 
is through its financial perfor-
mance, often and unfortunately 
even more so than critic and 
audience reception.
So, by that logic, the opposite 
should be true. Content produced 
by sexual assailants and rapists 
such as The Weinstein Com-
pany’s The Current War, a 
film about Thomas Edi-
son and his rivalry with 
George Westinghouse, 
should not be supported 
in any way, and such ac-
tion has been taken to 
reflect this. After pre-
miering at the Toronto 
International Film 
Festival, The Current 
War was pulled from 
the company’s release 
schedule after Harvey 
Weinstein’s allegations 
came to light. After alle-
gations of Kevin Spacey’s sexual 
misconduct hit news, Ridley 
Scott decided to scrap all of Spac-
ey’s scenes from All the Money in 
the World and reshoot them with 
Christopher Plummer recast in 
Spacey’s role, J. Paul Getty. Con-
tent produced by racists, such as 
ABC’s reboot of the beloved tele-
vision series Roseanne, should 
not be encouraged and spurned 
on at arrival. However, Rose-
anne is receiving positive reviews 
and 18 million viewers watched 
its premiere, according to The 
Washington Post.
Among a pop culture land-
scape that is largely liberal, it 
was a smart and tactical business 
decision for ABC to green-light 
Roseanne, a beloved sitcom with 
a conservative twist, in order to 
take advantage of an opening 
in the TV market: a show fea-
turing a character with highly 
conservative, 
pro-Trump 
political 
beliefs 
made 
by a 
woman with highly conserva-
tive, pro-Trump beliefs. Maybe 
ABC saw Barr as a marginal-
ized voice, even though she’s a 
white, working-class woman. So, 
ABC decided to give her the mic, 
and everyone involved saw their 
benefits from the deal.
What ABC should have done 
was take a look at the larger pic-
ture. What does taking on this 
property convey about our com-
pany image? What kind of public 
relations will this show receive, 
rather than just blindly accept-
ing whatever random assortment 
of attention Roseanne collects? 
Will we be able to still exercise 
some form of control over Rose-
anne if it gets out of hand? While 
ABC has worked with Roseanne 
Barr before, and therefore would 
have known what they were get-
ting themselves into, these are 
questions they still should have 
asked in 2018 before coming 
under any possible fire.
That’s not to say 
though that film stu-
dios and producers 
today haven’t made 
changes to reflect 
anti-racism. Last 
Wednesday, 
it was 
announced 
that Riverdale’s 
K.J. Apa would “pull a 
Christopher Plummer” 
and replace YouTuber 
Kian Lawley in 20th 
Century Fox’s book-to-
movie adaptation of An-
gie Thomas’ The Hate U 
Give, a novel which fol-
lows the life of 16-year 
old Starr Carter after she 
witnesses police officers 
shoot her unarmed child-
hood friend. Lawley was 
set to play Starr’s white 
boyfriend at the prep 
school she attends, and 
was dropped from the 
production last February 
after a past video of Law-
ley resurfaced showing 
him using the N-word 
and making racial slurs 
such as “‘We’re all black 
drinking purple 
Kool-aid and 
eating Ken-
tucky fried 
motherf***ing chicken,’” ac-
cording to Variety.
While it is a little easier in 
today’s liberal pop culture land-
scape to support a movie this 
socially aware and progressive, 
20th Century Fox did what ABC 
did not do, and take a step back 
to look at the larger picture. 
When initially buying the rights 
to this movie, 20th Century Fox 
also saw an opening in the mar-
ket — a politically charged movie 
about African-American issues 
— and hoped to profit lucrative-
ly from it after its release, which 
is still unknown due to Lawley’s 
recasting. In fact, they may even 
profit more after the release of 
Black Panther. They saw the hy-
pocrisy and image disparity in 
choosing a racist YouTube star 
to participate in a movie about 
a young black woman’s draw to 
activism inspired by the Black 
Lives Matter movement.
It’s an easy decision to-
day to take action against 
properties featuring 
actors, producers, and 
writers who have 
committed or 
been 
accused 
of sexual as-
sault or rape, 
so the hesitancy to take 
action against con-
tent produced by rac-
ists is puzzling. Has 
racism been such a 
timeless, unmovable, 
large, awkward issue 
that no one wants to 
strike it in the heart 
and instead keep 
prodding it with 
sticks for the next 
century?
Recently, Rose-
anne featured 
a joke digging 
at other ABC 
shows Black-ish 
and Fresh off the Boat, 
where Roseanne and her hus-
band Dan fall asleep through 
all the ABC programs between 
“Wheel to Kimmel.” Dan re-
marks, “We missed all the shows 
about black and Asian families,” 
to which Roseanne retorts back, 
“They’re just like us. There, now 
you’re all caught up.” In a bar-
rage of tweets made after the 
episode, writer Kelvin Yu slams 
the joke for belittling the black 
and Asian experience and say-
ing that “I actually think it’s too 
accurate.”
In order to better align their 
slate to their company image and 
draw in as many people from di-
verse backgrounds as possible, 
studios need to look at all ele-
ments of any film or property 
they decide to invest in, from the 
views and beliefs of everyone in-
volved to the creative content of 
the property itself. But we should 
be too. I’m not saying that we 
should be researching the back-
grounds of every actor and crew 
member on a film and stay as 
up-to-date as possible on all of 
Hollywood’s controversies and 
global political actions whenever 
we watch TV, because I certainly 
am not. Isn’t that why we 
read books, or watch 
TV and movies, to 
escape and get 
away from stuff 
like this? What I’m 
saying that is we 
should strive to be 
a little more aware 
with what we in-
vest our time and 
money into. We 
should think 
a little more 
about what 
we’re sup-
porting, 
and what 
our $9 
or an 
hour 
in 
front of 
a television 
will mean to the 
larger studios 
on the other 
side of the coast. 
It has a larger impact 
than it seems, and, 
in a couple years and 
with more calculat-
ed and aware distri-
bution, it will make 
Hollywood listen 
more to its public 
than to its bank 
account.

Scotland creates dangerous precendent for censorship
MADELINE KIM
Scottish YouTuber Mark 
Meechan, known as Count Dankula, 
was recently found guilty of a hate 
crime. The reason? Training his 
girlfriend’s dog to make a Nazi 
salute and posting it on YouTube.
In his now-deleted video titled 
“M8 yer dugs a Nazi,” Meechan 
begins the video by saying he 
wanted to turn the pug, Buddha, 
into the “least cute thing I could 
think of, which is a Nazi.” Buddha 
was trained to react excitedly upon 
hearing the phrase “gas the Jews,” 
give a Nazi salute when Meechan 
calls out “Sieg Heil!,” and watch 
videos of Adolf Hitler’s speeches 
with seemingly great enthusiasm. 
As someone who does not ?nd 
shock value to be very humorous, 
I found this type of humor to be 
brash at best. There are many 
adjectives that I would use to 
describe the video: distasteful, 
insensitive, provocative, even 
offensive. However, should it be 
prison-worthy? No.
Meechan’s video was not made 
to promote white supremacy or 
anti-Semitism. In fact, if we could 
build a time machine and show 
people in Nazi Germany this 
video, they would more likely be 
offended than supportive. In the 
early 1940s, Tor Borg, a man from 
Finland, trained his dog to respond 
to Hitler’s name by raising his paw. 
Nazi Germany actually found this 
to be offensive and patronizing 
and summoned Borg to the 
Germany Embassy in Helsinki. 
Although neither the dog nor 
Borg were negatively impacted, 
Borg potentially put his business 
in jeopardy by provoking the 
German suppliers that his company 
relied on. This suggests that this 
video would more than likely not 
empower neo-nazis; rather, it 
would more likely be perceived as 
a threat to the Nazi identity and 
make it appear to be a joke.
In the Jewish community, the 
reception of Meechan’s video 
appears to be mixed. Jewish 
comedian David Baddiel, who has 
been vocal about anti-semitism, 
came to Meechan’s defense. He 
took to Twitter to say that “an actual 
Nazi would not be teaching his ‘pug’ 
to Hitler salute.” Rabbi Abraham 
Cooper took a softer stance. Like 
Baddiel, Cooper does not ?nd 
jail time to be an appropriate 
punishment for the video. Rather, 
he suggests “[sentencing] the 
young man to meet with aging 
Holocaust survivors and U.K. 
World War II war heroes to learn 
why the Nazi Seig should never 
be a laughing matter.” However, 
this is not to say that everyone in 
the Jewish community is on the 
same page. Ephraim Borowski, 
director of the Scottish Council of 
Jewish Communities, agrees with 
the ruling. “It is grossly offensive. 
It stuns me that anyone should 
think it is a joke...My immediate 
reaction is that there is a clear 
distinction to be made between an 
offhand remark and the amount 
of effort that is required to train 
a dog like that.” This comes to 
show that those whom we would 
believe would be the most directly 
impacted in this case is diverse in 
thought and we cannot rely on one 
voice or project our own voices to 
speak on someone else’s behalf or 
to speak for a group.
I understand the appeal of 
wanting to inhibit the spread of 
potentially harmful messages. 
When Richard Spencer, the creator 
of the term “alt-right,” announced 
he would start his college tour 
at Auburn University, my initial 
reaction was “why isn’t Auburn 
shutting the event down?” I, 
like many others, feared that 
the university was giving him a 
platform to encourage radical 
ideas; therefore, shutting down the 
event felt like the logical reaction. 
However, looking back at the event 
a year later, I realized that taking 
away that platform could have 
been more detrimental, meaning 
what started as a noble intent to 
lessen extremism may actually 
have the adverse effect. Currently, 
Spencer’s ideology relies on 
the notion that it is so 
“dangerous” and 
incompatible 
with modern 
society. By 
prohibiting 
him from 
speaking, we 
are further con?rming one aspect 
of his ideology, thus potentially 
solidifying his ideology overall. 
Instead, allowing him to speak 
gave him less reason to believe that 
his ideology is being oppressed. His 
ideology became less mysterious 
and intriguing; rather, it showed 
itself to be illogical and weak. 
However, this is in a case in which 
someone had intent on radicalism 
and, arguably, hate speech; 
Meechan’s was in the context of 
humor and shock value. If allowing 
Spencer to speak was the better 
alternative, we should allow 
Meechan to continue comedy 
(albeit tasteless and unhumorous 
comedy) without imprisonment.
Furthermore, this could 
set a dangerous precedent to 
censorship and the end of freedom 
of speech. Although a party that 
has the intention of protecting 
minorities is in power, who is to 
say that the power might not fall 
into different hands who would 
censor content that they deem is 
harmful or offensive? Even though 
the intentions now  discouraging 
anti-semitism are good, allowing 
censorship and imprisonment 
now could give moral ground to 
imprison other actions that are 
considered “offensive”: protests, 
criticism, or anything showing 
disapproval of the government 
could all become “unacceptable.” 
This would shake the core of 
democracy. Democracy lies within 
the voice of the people; what would 
become of it once that is limited?
This is not to say that hate 
crimes don’t exist. However, we 
cannot con?ate hate crime or 
hate speech with “bad” speech. Of 
course, this line may become blurry 
at times; when does derogatory 
speech become malicious? The FBI 
currently de?nes it as “criminal 
offense against a person or 
property motivated in whole or in 
part by an offender’s bias against 
a race, religion, disability, sexual 
orientation, ethnicity, gender, 
or gender identity.” However, 
it notes that “hate itself is not a 
crime — and the FBI is mindful of 
protecting freedom of speech and 
other civil liberties.” Thus, the FBI 
would more than likely consider 
Meechan’s video to fall into the 
latter category, not a hate crime. 
The laws in Scotland extend their 
de?nition to include “offensive 
literature such as letters, lea?ets, 
posters” and “verbal abuse or 
insults including name-calling.” 
This is where the line gets trickier to 
draw. By this de?nition, Meechan’s 
video would be considered a 
hate crime, but again, it sets a 
dangerous precedent for what 
could be considered “offensive” 
or “verbal abuse.”
There are obviously potential 
consequences to any action. 
Such a video, like Meechan’s, 
might have sparked online 
outrage at worst, dialogue about 
the appropriate use of freedom 
of speech at best. YouTube, 
a privately owned company, 
could take whatever action they 
deemed necessary in regards 
to the video. However, a prison 
sentence is a completely different 
story. Protecting freedom of 
speech includes protecting 
speech that you don’t agree 
with, don’t like, or even ?nd 
offensive. By shutting down 
dialogue, we are chipping away 
at the fundamental value that 
comprises democracy.

Trump’s opioid death penalty proposal is archaic

The opioid crisis has swept 
the nation quickly in just a 
few years, and calls for action 
from the federal government 
have been met with little to no 
support.
Until now. President Donald 
Trump, a self-certified “stable 
genius” and the people’s 
President, has come forward 
with a plan to destroy the 
opioid epidemic and save the 
world. Well, at least that is 
what he thinks it will do. It is 
comprehensive in scope and 
legitimately the most sweeping 
legislation proposed in regard to 
the issue, but it is deeply flawed. 
One element of the proposal, in 
particular, has drawn shock and 
severe criticism from numerous 
pundits dealing with the issue 
directly. That element is Trump’s 
proposition that some drug 
dealers be put to death.
Yes, the death penalty for 
drug dealing. If you are thinking, 
“that seems to be an extreme 
punishment that could sentence 
someone to death for simply 
sharing a drug with a friend,” 
you are not alone. Even Trump 
recognizes this, but worry not, 
he assures only the “big pushers, 
the ones who are really killing 
people,” will face the death 
penalty.
This notion is alarmingly 
vague, as are most of Trump’s 
half-baked policy proposals. 
Implementing this into law, 
though, would be remarkably 
difficult and expensive. To 
even write legislation, Trump 
would have to clearly define his 
intentions and answer a number 
of questions. What defines a 
“big pusher?” Have they sold 
opioids twenty-five times? Fifty? 
One-hundred? Have any of their 
buyers died from overdose? How 
many of their buyers must have 
died for them to face the death 
penalty?
These questions call to mind 
the “war on drugs” and its 
numerous failures. Started by 
President Nixon in part as an 
effort to suppress black 
voters in a tumultuous time 
— this was confirmed by a 
Nixon advisor in 1994 — the 
war on drugs ravaged poor 
and marginalized communities 
across the nation. Through 
mandatory minimum sentencing 
laws implemented under 
President Reagan a few decades 
later, mass incarceration took 
shape in the United States and 
disproportionately imprisoned 
people of color. Look no further 
than differences in mandatory 
minimum sentencing 
differences between 
powdered 
cocaine and crack 
cocaine. Crack 
was the epidemic 
of Reagan’s era that 
he used to justify 
such extreme drug 
punishments. 
However, not 
only was drug use 
declining at the 
time that the war 
on drugs began, 
but mandatory 
minimums differed 
for crack cocaine 
and powdered cocaine. To be clear, 
the two substances are essentially 
the same. The only difference was 
their prominence: crack was most 
common in poor marginalized 
communities while powdered 
cocaine was mainly found in 
wealthy white communities. And 
yet, crack users would spend years 
in prison for an equivalent amount 
of the material that powdered 
cocaine users would spend a few 
months in jail for if they weren’t 
only asked to simply pay a ?ne.
So, drug policy to this day is 
contentious and has a real impact 
on people of color, particularly 
in poor communities. The opioid 
epidemic, then, and Trump’s 
proposed response would 
likely hit poor marginalized 
communities the hardest. Look 
no further for evidence of this 
than Attorney General Jeff 
Sessions, who has openly stated 
his desire to reinvigorate the 
war on drugs. If you question 
his racial motivations, look no 
further than his recent quote on 
“the Anglo-American heritage 
of law enforcement.” So, you 
would be rightfully concerned to 
worry how these policies might 
affect people of color, especially 
at a time rife with active voter 
suppression efforts undertaken 
by Trump himself.
Moreover, moving the 
conversation on drug policy to the 
death penalty sets a dangerous 
precedent. If this actually were to 
be enacted into law, who would be 
most affected? And this time, the 
punishment would not be mass 
incarceration, it would be mass 
extermination. Drug dealing is 
an act often carried out 
by struggling people looking for 
a way to support themselves, and 
Trump now has advocated for 
killing them for trying to survive. 
Is what they are doing immoral? 
Of course it is. But, does it really 
deserve the death penalty? No. 
Absolutely not. And to appeal 
to the conservatives out there, 
if nothing else, remember that 
death sentencing puts inmates 
on death row for years and costs 
taxpayers a great deal more than 
a typical imprisonment.

Defunct space station Tiangong-1 crashes to Earth
Nano-structure of eggshells protects baby birds in vitro
ROSE EILENBERG
Junior Staffwriter
Eggshells, of course, have 
the important job of provid-
ing adequate protection for 
the developing chick it con-
tains, allowing it to develop 
outside of a hen’s uterus. 
But, it doesn’t just have to be 
strong — it also needs to al-
low the chick to escape when 
its development is complete.
Biomineralization is a 
550-million-year-old process 
by which organisms make 
hard structural features. The 
eggshell of a domestic chick-
en is roughly 95 percent the 
mineral calcium-carbonate 
and about 3.5 percent or-
ganic material by weight. 
The incorporation of or-
ganic material and the spe-
ci?c nanostructure lead to 
mechanical properties that 
provide distinct advantages 
for the animals that produce 
them.
Even though an eggshell 
is only a third of a millimeter 
thick, it is not uniform. It is 
in fact comprised of differ-
ent layers, each with distinct 
nano-structures.
Biominerals have com-
plex nano-structures that 
can’t form without the help 
of speci?c proteins. There 
are hundreds of these pro-
teins that are critical to the 
precise crystallization pat-
terns found in nature. The 
structures help improve the 
shells’ mechanical proper-
ties, making it strong and 
preventing cracking (before 
it becomes necessary).
A team of researchers 
from institutions from Can-
ada, the U.S., Germany, and 
Spain worked to ?nd out 
how these protein-mineral 
interactions make eggshells 
what they are.
In their March 2018 pa-
per published in Science 
Advances, the researchers 
identi?ed the existence of 
a nano-granular structure 
in eggshells. The size of 
these nano-building blocks 
varied depending on the 
shell region. The changes in 
structure through the shell 
are thought to stem from 
variations in protein content 
though the exact processes 
are not well understood.
By testing across the 
shell cross-section, the sci-
entists found that hardness 
and elasticity gradually de-
creases from the outside of 
the eggshell towards the 
central region, which ?ts 
logically with what scientists 
predicted about material 
hardness. Curiously, as they 
approached the innermost 
layer, the measurements no 
longer matched the predic-
tion; the team is still unsure 
of exactly why.
An eggshell’s composition 
is not static over the course 
of the chick embryo’s devel-
opment: it actually partially 
dissolves throughout the 
incubation period. The sci-
entists compared the nano-
structures of the shells from 
incubated and un-incubated 
fertilized eggs. They found 
smaller nano-structure sizes 
in the innermost layer; they 
believe this special structure 
enables it to partially dis-
solve. This dissolution serves 
two important purposes: the 
dissolved material is a source 
of calcium required for the 
development of the chick’s 
skeleton, and it reduces the 
shell’s thickness, facilitating 
the chick’s escape.
To explore the effects 
of protein on shell devel-
opment, the team grew 
synthetic calcium carbon-
ate crystals in the presence 
of the protein osteopontin 
(OPN), which is so named 
because of its initial discov-
ery in bone. The crystals 
grown in the control experi-
ment did not show any spe-
ci?c internal nano-structure, 
but when grown with OPN, 
a nano-structure was clearly 
present. They found that 
the size of the nano-struc-
ture was dependent on the 
amount of protein in the ini-
tial mixture. These ?ndings 
can inform the development 
of bio-inspired nano-com-
posites with unique prop-
erties. The higher the OPN 
concentration, the smaller 
the size — a sign that the 
nano-structure size, and the 
resulting material proper-
ties, is tunable.
These results have some 
promising applications. Egg-
shell mechanical properties 
abruptly decrease after a hen 
has been laying for a year, 
which is a substantial prob-
lem for the egg industry. 
Understanding the mecha-
nisms by which eggshells get 
their strength can help ?nd a 
way to extend the egg laying 
period of hens while main-
taining eggshell strength.

The Chinese space sta-
tion Tiangong-1 crashed 
to Earth last week, follow-
ing the decay of its orbit. 
It was China’s first proto-
type space station and was 
in orbit around the Earth 
from Sept. 2011 to April 
2018.
Tiangong-1, out of use 
since 2013, entered Earth’s 
atmosphere at 8:15 a.m. 
Beijing time on the morn-
ing of April 2 and landed in 
the Pacific Ocean. 
Most of its major 
components burned up 
before they hit the water.
Both scientific agencies 
and media outlets were 
closely watching the space 
station in the weeks pre-
ceding its descent to Earth. 
Tiangong-1’s fall was 
planned to be a controlled 
descent from the skies, 
“much like the Mir space 
station was,” according to 
U.S. astronaut Leroy Chiao. 
“There’s a specific loca-
tion in the ocean known as 
the spacecraft graveyard 
where nations try and put 
down into.”
However, Chinese space 
agency officials reported 
to the United Nations that 
they had lost communica-
tions with the space sta-
tion and would be unable 
to control when or where 
it fell. Despite the antici-
pation, the space station’s 
crash was not particularly 
eventful.
Though it missed the 
“spacecraft graveyard” 
by a few thousand miles, 
Tiangong-1 landed in a re-
mote area of the Pacific, 
far from land — as proba-
bility would dictate, given 
that oceans cover most of 
Earth’s surface.
“It did exactly what it 
was expected to do; the 
predictions, at least the 
past 24 hours’ ones, were 
spot on; and as expected it 
fell somewhere empty and 
did no damage,” said Jona-
than McDowell, an astro-
physicist at the Harvard-
Smithsonian Center for 
Astrophysics.  
China has announced 
its plans to build a brain 
science center — one 
that will also function as 
the core facility for the 
country’s brain project. 
This comes right at the 
heels of the U.S.-Europe 
billion-dollar initiative 
in 2014, Japan in 2015, 
and South Korea in 2016.
The Chinese Institute 
for Brain Research, as 
it will be called, will be 
headed by Rao Yi from 
Peking University and 
Luo Minmin from the Na-
tional Institute of Biolog-
ical Sciences in Beijing. It 
was officially established 
on March 22 with an 
agreement signed by the 
municipality and seven
 research organiza-
tions from Beijing. The 
institute will work in 
partnership with other 
premier institutions in 
the country — Chinese 
Academy of Sciences, 
the Academy of Military 
Medical Sciences, Peking 
University, and Tsinghua 
University.
Luo has said that he 
would be in-charge of 50 
principal investigators 
while Rao would look 
at supporting around 
100 scientists all over 
China. In the next year, 
Luo plans to use the 180 
million Chinese yuan 
(29 million USD) by the 
Chinese municipal gov-
ernment to hire five to 
six research groups and 
move them to an already 
constructed building, 
which is a short distance 
away from his institute.
At the moment, few 
concrete details have 
been released to the pub-
lic. It is expected that the 
government will launch 
the initiative more for-
mally by the end of this 
year.

Researchers from 
Columbia University 
have found evidence for 
the prediction that black 
holes at the center of 
galaxies are surrounded 
by smaller black holes 
by studying data from 
NASA’s Chandra X-ray 
telescope. This study 
was published in Nature 
on April 5.
Charles Hailey and 
colleagues found that 
there were dozens of 
black holes and binary 
systems — where stars 
orbit another celestial 
object like a black hole 
— around the center of 
the Milky Way.
Hailey explains, “Iso-
lated, unmated black 
holes are just black — 
they don’t do anything...
But when black holes 
mate with a low mass 
star, the marriage emits 
X-ray bursts that are 
weaker, but consistent 
and detectable.”
The black hole at the 
center of the Milky Way, 
Sagittarius A, provides 
an ideal environment 
for stars to be formed 
around it. The black 
holes reel in passing 
stars, and form these bi-
nary systems.
Hailey confirms the 
importance of the work, 
saying “It is going to 
significantly advance 
gravitational wave re-
search because know-
ing the number of black 
holes in the center of a 
typical galaxy can help 
in better predicting 
how many gravitational 
wave events may be as-
sociated with them.”

Researchers ?nd that old brains have as many new neurons as young brains China announces new brain-research center which will be located in BeijingMilky Way has black holes in binary systems with stars in the center
Scientists have found 
that the memory-related 
parts of the brain, of peo-
ple in in their seventies 
have just as many new 
nerve cells as teenag-
ers, or young adults. This 
study was published in Cell 
Stem Cell on April 5 and 
contradicts another study 
published in March that 
stated that the process of 
creating new nerve cells — 
neurogenesis — stopped in 
childhood.
The researchers stud-
ied the autopsied brains 
of 17 men and 11 women, 
between ages 14 and 79. 
The donors had no psy-
chiatric or chronic illness, 
and the researchers found 
no alcohol or drugs in the 
specimens. Furthermore, 
because the researchers 
had access to the entire 
hippocampus — an area of 
the brain related to emo-
tion, memory, and learn-
ing — they were able to 
gather more data before 
making estimates — which 
leads to more accurate es-
timates on the number of 
newer nerve cells.
This is not to say that 
the older brains structure 
and function exactly the 
same as younger ones. 
Some signs of decline were 
found in the older brains, 
such as lesser formation 
of blood vessels and pro-
tein markers. This would 
mean that the older people 
would have less neuroplas-
ticity — the brain’s ability 
to make connections be-
tween cells.
The study of changes in 
the brain’s structure and 
its functioning over time 
is important, as it helps us 
gain a better understand-
ing of what several con-
ditions look like in older 
brains and perhaps, how 
a better understanding 
would help us solve them.

NHL Playoffs Preview: Penguins aim for a three-peat
MARIKA YANG
Sports Editor
Fresh off competing at 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
annual Quad meet, junior 
Autumn Hair is ready to 
?nish the last four weeks of 
the track and ?eld season.
Hair, a professional 
writing major, recorded 
a career-best distance of 
10.80 meters in the triple 
jump, winning the event 
and helping the Tartans 
win the overall meet by a 
wide margin. Growing up 
mainly in Georgia and the 
Philadelphia area, Hair had 
a rocky start to her track and 
?eld career, which began 
when she was in seventh 
grade at the age of 12.
“I was really terrible at 
it,” Hair said in an interview. 
“I started off as a sprinter, 
and [the coaches] basically 
told me that I needed to try 
other stuff, because I was so 
bad at sprinting. Luckily, I’ve 
gotten a lot better now.”
Hair switched to jumping, 
which proved to be a much 
better ?t. Though today she 
still competes in the 4x100 
meter relay, the long jump 
and the triple jump are the 
main events she competes in 
for the Tartans. Her journey 
to Carnegie Mellon’s track 
and ?eld team began with 
an acceptance letter and an 
email, not recruitment.
“I wasn’t recruited 
for track,” she said. “I 
had already gotten [into 
Carnegie Mellon], then 
I emailed [Head Coach] 
Aldrich, and we were in 
touch and he said, ‘Your 
distances are good’ — not 
that much to it.”
For Hair, both the team 
and individual aspects of 
track and ?eld contributed 
to her desire to continue 
competing in college.
“I wanted to try to get 
better at jumping too, ‘cause 
I didn’t feel like my career 
was over in high school. I 
just love competing and I 
love being part of a team. 
But, I do like that it’s more 
of an individual sport — if 
I have a bad performance, I 
only let myself down. It’s not 
like with the 4x100, if I drop 
the baton, then I let that 
whole team down.”
The team aspect of the 
Tartan squad translates off 
the track. The team spends 
most of their time together 
away from competing with 
each other. Hair says most of 
her friends have come from 
track and ?eld.
“Even when we’re not 
at practice, we just hang 
out with each other,” she 
said. “We de?nitely are 
very close. It de?nitely has 
impacted the people I’ll be 
friends with for the rest of 
my life.”
The track and ?eld 
schedule is a full-year, two-
semester grind. After several 
weeks of strength and con-
ditioning workouts in the 
fall semester, the team com-
petes for six weeks in indoor 
track and ?eld, followed by 
six more weeks in outdoor 
competitions.
Athletes in different 
events maintain different 
schedules. Hair’s schedule 
consists of ?ve practices a 
week: three days of two-
hour workouts and two 
days of three-hour workouts 
each week. Though it is a 
packed schedule, Hair says 
that it has helped her better 
prioritize and manage her 
schedule.
Hair’s collegiate track 
and ?eld career will not end 
this semester, as she has 
one year left of eligibility. 
She is excited to continue 
competing and improving.
“I didn’t start off very 
good at it, but I got better 
and I could see myself 
improving. The results are 
very tangible. You can see 
that your distances are 
getting farther, and you can 
feel your form improving,” 
she said. “I really like to be 
able to focus on myself and 
improve my own skills, but 
also being able to cheer on 
my teammates.”

In her third season, junior Autumn Hair continues to improve her jumping distances at competitions.

“I wanted 
to try to 
get better 
at jumping 
too, ‘cause 
I didn’t feel 
like my career 
was over in 
high school. 
I just love 
competing.”

This spring, the weather 
is inconsistent, but one 
thing about Pittsburgh 
holds true — the return of 
playoff hockey. 
For the 12th year in 
a row, the Pittsburgh 
Penguins will be returning 
to the NHL Stanley Cup 
playoffs. Decided late on 
Saturday, the Penguins 
will be facing their rivals to 
the east, the Philadelphia 
Flyers, in the playoffs for 
the first time since 2012. 
Now as they look to win 
the Stanley Cup for the 
third straight year, their 
future looks promising.
The Penguins’ offensive 
production this season 
has maintained the same 
punishing pace started last 
year, with 270 goals in 81 
games thus far, only eight 
behind their previous 
mark. 
Although they are 
now allowing the fewest 
number of shots against 
per game in the past two 
seasons, the Penguins 
have also suffered from 
goalie issues throughout 
the season, plagued with 
injuries and call-ups 
throughout the season. 
Thus, their defense has 
struggled, landing them 
in second place in the 
Metropolitan division 
behind the Washington 
Capitals. However, they 
held that spot both in 2016 
and 2017, and were able to 
beat the Capitals in Round 
2 of the playoffs on their 
way to a Cup victory.
What are the chances 
for a three-peat? Only a 
few teams have ever won 
the Cup more than twice 
in a row — notably the 
New York Islanders and 
the Montreal Canadiens 
— but, the Penguins have 
continued to impress 
throughout the season 
with their high level of 
play. 
Expectations were 
extremely high entering 
this season, and while 
some stretches of the 
year left much to be 
desired, the Penguins have 
returned to their rightful 
place as a threat to any 
team. Forward Evgeni 
Malkin is having a career 
year, only two points away 
from reaching 100 on the 
season. This would be his 
fourth time accomplishing 
the feat. He leads the team 
with 42 goals, while team 
captain Sidney Crosby has 
recorded 60 assists on the 
year.
Looking into the 
postseason, these are 
promising numbers for a 
team facing astronomical 
expectations. Starting 
goaltender Matt Murray, 
who was the star of the 
2016 playoffs and held 
down the back end last year 
as well, has been putting 
up high numbers rounding 
into the postseason, and 
backup Casey DeSmith 
currently leads the team in 
save percentage and goals 
allowed. 
The problem comes at 
the Eastern Conference 
finals, where, if the 
Penguins are able to win 
both their first two series, 
they will likely be staring 
down either the Tampa 
Bay Lightning or the 
Boston Bruins, two teams 
who are having incredible 
years after missing last 
year’s  playoffs. Not to 
mention, in the West, the 
Nashville Predators have 
clinched the President’s 
Trophy for the first time 
in team history and have a 
solid chance of making the 
finals for the second year 
in a row, an opportunity 
to get revenge on the Pens 
this time around.
However, they first 
must defeat the Flyers, a 
task that sounds simple 
on paper, but draws plenty 
of complications. After 
clinching third place in the 
Metropolitan Division by 
handily defeating the New 
York Rangers, the Flyers 
finished only two points 
back from the Penguins, 
despite struggling earlier 
in the season. 
Flyers captain Claude 
Giroux scored three 
goals in the victory on 
Saturday, bringing his 
total to 34 goals on the 
season and 102 points on 
the season, beating out 
Pittsburgh’s top scorers. 
While no one else on the 
team has met his offensive 
production, rookie Nolan 
Patrick and second-year 
Travis Konecny have both 
had breakout seasons, 
scoring 13 and 24 goals 
respectively. 
The Pens have won 
all four games against 
the Flyers this season, 
although two of them were 
decided in overtime. Right 
now, the Penguins are 
favored to win the playoff 
series, but the Flyers 
are unlikely to go down 
without a fight, and have a 
strong chance of becoming 
this year’s underdog story.
The NHL Stanley Cup 
playoffs begin this week. 
Since the Penguins came 
in second, they will have 
home ice advantage. Game 
dates and times have not 
yet been announced.

On struggles with love life 
Dear Izzy,
I’m pretty sure whichever deity — Cupid, Aphrodite, 
Beyoncé — controls my love life or the love lives 
of those around me, just like dropped dead off 
the face of the earth because not only did all my 
friends get their hearts broken this week but 
so did mine!!!!!! Many people got dumped by 
significant others. A few got badly rejected. One 
got cheated on. For me, my past strong feelings for 
someone I thought I got over decided to resurface 
again and be like “WHAT UP IT’S YA BOI.”
So, I guess I have several questions. The first one 
is more general: do you have any ideal group pick-
me-up solutions to help us get over our situations, 
or just ways that I can help my friends, even 
though I’m also hurting? The second one is a little 
bit more personal and geared towards me: how can 
I keep this from happening? How can I get myself 
out of this cycle of falling in love, then accepting 
and being falsely happy about my situation, then 
digging up my feelings again? I always knew my 
feelings for this person were really strong, and 
that this person was really important to me and 
that I wanted them in my life for a long time, but I 
always keep relapsing and hurting myself over and 
over again. Can you help me and my friends get 
over these manses?
Sincerely, 
Somehow I’m Not Getting Love Ever (again)
Dear SINGLE (again),
First, please don’t scare me like that. Beyoncé is 
still gracing us with her presence on this lowly 
earth and is very alive and well preparing to smite 
the masses with her talent, while headlining this 
year’s Coachella lineup.
Second, the best part about struggling in a group 
is that you’re all struggling together. You can all 
relate to each other and are all in the same boat. 
If you all really are true friends, you can always 
rely on them to help pull you out of your situation. 
And they can rely on you, too; your friends are 
going through a lot right now, and they will need 
you now more than ever. 
Sometimes, the best kind of solutions are 
extremely low-key. At the start, just all sit down 
somewhere — in the comfort of someone’s home, 
in a loud bar, in a restaurant with great food — 
and vent it out with each other. Just spitting out 
things you want to say or get off your chest is 
pretty therapeutic, and no matter where you are 
you will be surrounded by a community of people 
who love you.
You can also branch out from there. Form a little 
lonely hearts club and plan some fun things to do 
together every day so that you all have something 
to look forward to. Explore Pittsburgh some more, 
try new restaurants, or see some movies that 
look surprisingly good. Friends really do help fill 
those empty gaps in your heart, and from these 
experiences, your bond between each other will 
just grow stronger.
Third, I can’t deny the fact that you’re stuck in a 
really weird position and situation — and it can 
sometimes make you feel like you’ve got it the 
worst out of all your friends. But, you’re doing a 
great thing so far: recognizing that you are in a 
cycle. The next time you find yourself in it, stop and 
take a breath to assess your situation. Recognize 
how you led yourself to this spot, and remember it 
for the future so you can plan out what to do next 
time you encounter it. That way, you can fight it off 
with positivity or whatever solution you come up 
with.
I also applaud you for the fact that you’re trying 
to make it work! It can be really hard, and you’ll 
struggle, but the most important thing to know 
is that it takes time. And, it’ll work itself out. 
It’s one of the harder yet truer things to hear 
because waiting for things to fix themselves in 
your mind does take a while, or sometimes never 
happens. But, life goes on. And stuff happens in 
life that’ll push your pain to the side or cure it with 
something — or someone — new.
Hope you and your friends get over your manses,
Izzy
Jade Crockem | Contributing EditorBar Buddies: Bakersfield
This week, I once again found myself downtown 
looking to spend my hard earned paycheck on 
two things: tacos and tequila. This led me to 
Bakersfield on Penn Ave. I know I’m going to 
spend most of this article talking about the drinks, 
but I have to mention the food at least once. The 
tacos are amazing, especially the baja shrimp 
ones featuring fried shrimp, guacamole, and red 
cabbage among other toppings. All the tacos 
feature house-made tortillas and are served on a 
single platter, and everyone is given plates to help 
grab their tacos. The queso is also amazing. It’s 
basically a skillet of cheese and they give you the 
perfect cheese-to-chip ratio which is so important. 
Okay, now that I’ve gotten that out of the way, on 
to the good stuff.
The location: Located on Penn Ave., Bakersfield 
is in the middle of all the action downtown. This 
makes it a considerable ride away from campus, 
so it’s not the place to just stop by on a night out, 
it’s your destination for the night. It’s also right 
next to Sienna Mercato and a few other bars if 
you find yourself wanting to hop around. Getting 
out of the Oakland, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill 
triangle makes me feel like I’m actually hanging 
out in Pittsburgh rather than the mini Carnegie 
Mellon bubble that covers campus and all the 
surrounding areas.
The drinks: I should actually just rename this 
section “the drink” for this week because there 
was only one drink that I had the entire night: 
margaritas. The margarita pitchers at this place 
are delicious. My personal favorites are their 
house mix and the pineapple margarita. They’re 
so good that it’s easy to forget that it’s alcoholic 
so let me remind you: margaritas contain the 
devil’s drink a.k.a. tequila. No matter how good 
they are, do not drink a whole glass super fast. I 
made the mistake so that you don’t have to. Also, 
maybe don’t order two pitchers.
The vibe: Like most restaurants in Pittsburgh, the 
space is rather small so you’ll wait a while for 
a table, but it’s definitely worth it. I recommend 
popping over to the rooftop bar in Sienna 
Mercato to have a drink and pass the time. 
Since the restaurant is so small, much of the 
seating is communal or are tables that are very 
close together so it can feel a bit like you’re out 
to dinner with twenty of your closest friends. 
Bakersfield only plays country music which is a 
bit confusing because it makes it difficult to really 
pick up on a theme. I mostly just spent the whole 
night hoping that they would play different music, 
because I really wanted to sing and dance, but it 
never happened. Downstairs there’s even more 
bar space in a place that feels a bit like a saloon 
which I guess makes sense with the country theme.
Lit or nah: It’s definitely lit. The music is loud, the 
food and drinks are good, and the vibe is nice. 
Honestly any time I go out with my friends, it 
feels like we’re the only people in the room and 
everyone else are just bystanders to our good 
time. But, having a place like Bakersfield with 
good drinks and better food definitely helps to 
facilitate our good time.

Interview with Bill Burr

Bill Burr, one of the most lauded 
comedic voices of his generation, 
came to Pittsburgh’s Benedum Center on 
April 6. Featured in shows like Chappelle’s 
Show and Breaking Bad, the comedian 
boasts a large screen presence in addition to 
his stand-up specials.
The Tartan sat down with Burr prior to his 
performance. In the interview, writers Rohit 
Harlalka and Natalie Schmidt are “R” and 
“N,” respectively, and Bill Burr is “B.”
R: I’m looking forward to seeing you live on 
Friday in Pittsburgh. I’ve been following you, 
since I was a teenager, so I’m really excited!
B: Oh, that’s awesome! I’m ready to go! I’ve 
written a whole new 90 minutes, and it’s been 
a minute since I’ve been in Pittsburgh. I’m fly-
ing in a day early, ‘cause Randy Baumann 
from WDVE has been putting me on since 
2006 or 2007, and he’s one of the major rea-
sons that I was able to finally start selling some 
tickets in Pittsburgh. I love those guys.
R: I love your “City Tour” videos. Do you think 
you’ll have time to do one here?
B: I should do one! Since I’ve had my daugh-
ter, traveling’s been a little different than the 
way I used to do it. I don’t want to miss her 
being a little girl, so I just fly in the day of. I 
don’t have much time in cities the way I used 
to, but it’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make 
because she’s awesome.
N: Has it gotten any easier balancing touring 
since the start?
B: Sometimes after shows, you’re like, oh man, 
I’m missing something [my daughter’s] doing! 
But, that’s where FaceTime comes in, thank 
God. It’s one of those deals where, if I 
was a plumber, I’d still have to go out 
and fix things. But, I’m home a lot. I work two 
weekends a month, most of the stuff local. I just 
build the schedule around her, which is a fun 
thing to do.
R: What would you say is the most satisfying 
part about your job?
B: It’s the dream of mine to be a comedian, to 
go around the country and sell tickets. I have 
to work at living a dream! (laughs) When I had 
other jobs, my motivation was getting the hell 
out of there. I’m not gonna lie to you, there 
were definitely a lot of tough years and tough 
gigs. Even then, I get to do what I love.
R: Do you remember the worst you ever 
bombed?
B: I don’t think about them, but I could sit here 
for hours and tell you all kinds of stories of get-
ting stuff thrown at me, getting fired, people 
writing letters. I was never the flavor of the 
month, so I had to do all the gigs, so I have 
the stories! (laughs) I do have a lot of empathy 
for people who get shot up the ladder. They 
have to figure out all of this stuff when they’re 
in their twenties, and it’s not an easy thing. Life 
is all about getting knocked down and learning 
how to come back up even harder. Not being 
stupid about it and keep running into the same 
wall the same way, you adjust and try to get 
over it. That was a skill I didn’t have early on, 
and I used to get eaten up by a lot of things. 
It’s gotten to the point now that when I do get 
knocked down, I get this adrenaline rush. It’s 
weird, it’s just like, “Alright, you just watch 
this. I’ll come back f***ing harder.” (laughs) 
They’re not telling young people things like 
that. They’re telling them, “You can do whatev-
er you want blah blah,” but they’re leaving out 
how hard you have to work and how you gotta 
develop that skill of getting punched in your 
face, falling on your ass, and then getting back 
up again and learning how to stop your brain 
from sending you negative 
messages and that you can’t 
do it. You gotta be cognizant of 
those thoughts and beat the shit out 
of them so they don’t take your dream 
away!
N: A lot of people have a lot of different reac-
tions to your comedy, and I think it’s because 
you have a really different outlook. What’s 
your process writing new material?
B: It’s a combination of saying what I’m think-
ing and trying to annoy people before I go 
somewhere. (laughs) Sometimes, if a crowd 
is being overly sensitive, I will deliberately 
say things that make ‘em groan, and then 
I go even harder in that direction until they 
start laughing because it’s so ridiculous! If 
someone’s being malicious and hateful, and 
that’s all they’re doing, I understand that. The 
amount of people that waste all this energy 
getting offended for another group of people 
that won’t even get offended by the joke 
is ridiculous. There’s a couple of bits 
that I’ve actually done in front of 
the group of people — and this 
isn’t a race or religion thing, it’s 
more like a branch of the gov-
ernment — and they love them. 
I think comics get in trouble 
because it’s lazy journalism. A 
lot of people that should be getting 
s**t don’t because they’re advertising 
these on news channels. But when we do a 
gender-neutral joke or something like that, all 
of a sudden it becomes like this big thing. And 
it’s just a giant pile of nothing.
N: Do you find it harder being a comedian 
nowadays?
B: No. Absolutely not, I find it way 
more fun because it’s bulls**t! A 
majority of people don’t go to a 

---------------------------------------------------

comedy show to get offended. 
You do a show in front of 500 
people and 499 enjoy it, and one 
person complains, that’s what people 
focus on. If you had that approval rating 
as a president, you’d be the most popular 
president of all time! And, if Donald Trump 
taught me anything, I couldn’t believe the lack 
of follow-up with the press when he ran for 
president. They would call him out on stuff and 
he’d be like, “I never said that!” and they’d 
go, “Yeah you did!” and he’d say, “Eh, you’re 
probably right!” And then, nothing after that. 
I guess they were so used to people trying to 
dodge questions, and not owning up to it. And 
it’s just like, “Now what do we do?” The first 
person I ever saw do that was Madonna. They 
found nude pictures of her. She goes, “Oh you 
found those? I got better ones.” And it was 
supposed to be a huge scandal, but she just 
completely didn’t give a shit. The whole thing 
just died. Which is cool to see a pop star do 
that! And this isn’t some kind of liberal rant, I 
didn’t like either one of ‘em.
N: F is for Family got picked up for a third 
season. What’s it like writing for that show 
now that you’re a father yourself?
B: The only difference was I tried to get out 
of the writer’s room a little earlier (laughs). 
‘Cause I spend time with my daughter in the 
morning and then I’d go to work. I’d miss her, 
and she’d nap, and then she has the afternoon 
when she’s up and then she’d nap again. So 
I’d miss the afternoon thing. But once a week 
my wife would come in for lunch and she’d 
bring her. That’s all. I’m not gonna do this 
thing where I’m a dad now and I’m gonna 
pretend like I’m not a crap moron, you 
know? That is what I am, and that’s what 
got me here, I’m not gonna sit there 
all of a sudden with this “holier than 
thou” schtick.
R: Do you think you’re gonna focus more on 
shows like F is for family now, or continue 
doing stand-up for the foreseeable future?
B: Oh God no. No way! This business is a 
hustle. If you have any sort of hustle in this 
business that you have control of, you can’t let 
that go. My stand-up and my podcast are my 
number one things because I can’t fire me. I 
love doing F is for Family, but that show ends 
the second Netflix decides they don’t want to 
do it anymore.
R: It’s good to hear that you’re sticking with 
the stuff you like to do!
B: Yeah! I love doing F is for Family and I love 
the people I work with. It’s great, their notes 
are unbelievably supportive. At the end of the 
day, it’s their show. Plus, I love doing standup, 
I love doing my podcast, but it would be too 
unsettling to be in a position like that with 
anybody where they could fire me. And I think 
that for anybody who’s ever worked with them-
selves, to go back into that situation would be 
a little scary.
N: Was it a big change writing standup as 
opposed to writing an animated Netflix show?
B: Jokes are jokes. I didn’t know how to write 
a script, really. My writer’s room is wall-to-wall 
killer, I learn from them every day. The great 
Mike Price, the co-creator of the show from The 
Simpsons, just watching how he runs the room. 
I could get too focused on a conversation or 
bit, and he’s the guy that keeps the story mov-
ing. I didn’t get it at first, I was like, “Aw man, 
you cut out this whole chunk, blah blah blah,” 
and I didn’t realize that it was spinning off into 
this whole tangent, I wasn’t staying on story. 
With each season, I feel like I’m getting a little 
bit better at that. There’s definitely days when 
the script isn’t working and I think, “how the 
hell did I sign myself up for this?” But the days 
when it is — which are most days 
— it’s worth it.
R: I’ve always wanted to ask you — if 
you were God for a day, what would be the 
first thing you would do?
B: I’m trying to think of the one thing that 
would fix the most things. I would somehow 
restructure corporations, so that they actually 
function in a human way. I think that would 
eliminate a lot of wars. I don’t think that 
people who work in corporations are evil, I 
think the way the game is set up is. I would 
like to think that people wouldn’t want to kill 
other people so they could make a profit. But I 
don’t understand [why] war is still legal. They 
talk about the economy, but they don’t say the 
real thing: you have dead bodies on your con-
science. It’s so funny to me to see Hollywood 
people going, “I’m gonna run for President!” 
It’s like, “Dude, you’re gonna have to make 
decisions where to drop bombs and they’re 
gonna land on somebody’s baby and you’re 
gonna to go to bed justifying that.” You wanna 
be that guy that makes that f**king decision? I 
have learned though, that we gotta stop blam-
ing each other and we have to just sit down 
and try to figure out how to get out of this 
thing.
R: Is there anything you want to say to people 
who are going to your shows this weekend?
B: I want to say thank you so much for buying 
tickets and allowing me to continue to live my 
dream! I plan on giving you more than your 
money’s worth! And go Bruins! (laughs) That’s 
for the Penguins fans out there!
To see more of Burr, check out his 
Netflix specials, his podcast Monday 
Morning Podcast and be on the 
lookout for his feature in the 2018 
film The Front Runner.

---------------------------------------------------

Bill Burr has a personality that perfectly 
complements the brand he’s built himself — 
confident, informal, and always angry. Hailing 
from the outskirts of Boston — which explains 
his lovely accent — he’s had one of the most 
successful careers of any stand up comic 
around: five Netflix specials (and counting!) 
and a successful animated show called F is 
for Family, co-created by him and Michael 
Price, who won an Emmy Award for his writing 
on The Simpsons. Fans of Breaking Bad will 
also recognize him as Patrick Kuby, one of 
Saul Goodman’s hired hands. He also runs 
a podcast called Bill Burr’s Monday Morning 
Podcast, which consists of him ranting about 
every topic you can think of, from going to the 
dentist to nuclear proliferation. In short, he’s 
everywhere, and if you like comedy that seeks 
to offend, Bill Burr is your man.
The Tartan recently got the chance to talk to 
him about his show at the Benedum Center 
on Friday night, and I am happy to say that 
he sounds and behaves exactly like he does 
on screen. He has no qualms about going 
political, talking about race, or even talking 
about sexism and double standards. He 
makes himself laugh with his jokes, and his 
laugh is so infectious you can’t help but laugh 
along with him at some of the seemingly 
most inappropriate jokes you will ever hear. 
Bouncing from story to story, he goes off on 
tangents that seem to never end, but yet 
he ties them back together somehow at the 
end. One of his rants starts at how African-
Americans dominate basketball in the United 
States, and he ties it back to Hitler wanting 
to create a superior race, saying “I think we 
already did! Send a select group of people 
every day for a couple hundred years, and it’s 
paying dividends!” He just mixed race, Hitler, 
and slavery into one sentence, something I 
didn’t think was possible. However, if you are 
easily offended, you might want to think twice 
about watching him perform. His favorite 
pastime is offending people who are easy 
targets.
One of the big changes in his material is about 
family — he spent most of his career talking 
about being single or having a girlfriend, 
but he now has a one-year old daughter, 
which has led to some fascinating changes. 
Watching his older material and comparing 
it with the newer stuff, you can see how he’s 
grown into his role as a dad. He talks about 
the story of how his daughter was born, and 
how his love took the form of anger towards 
anyone he suspected would harm her. His 
material has gotten softer in the way he looks 
at relationships and family, while retaining the 
edge with which he cuts through every trending 
topic you can think of. Burr walks the very 
fine line between good taste and insensitivity, 
and does so with aplomb. He talks about 
the “rules” that define masculinity, and why 
guys are going to die early because “It’s from 
five decades of suppressing an urge to hug 
a puppy, admitting a baby’s cute, saying you 
want a cookie.” Moments of vulnerability are 
quickly followed by self-depreciating taunts, 
which allow him to get away with exploring 
thoughts best left unsaid in polite company.
Burr has an unmistakable sense of charm, 
swaggering across the stage with a puffed 
up chest, going on an angry rant about 
overpopulation. He walks over to the mic 
stand, leans on it, and lowers his voice, and 
suddenly goes off talking about how hitting 
women should be acceptable. He embodies 
the persona of a middle-aged confused white 
guy in these modern times, with everyone so 
sensitive that he can’t speak his mind. A short 
fuse means that he gets to talk about and 
analyze the smallest details in daily life we 
all experience and hate — like people who 
take off their socks and shoes on commercial 
planes. Now I’m sure that annoys all of us, 
but he takes it to another level by playing the 
hothead who wants to kill everyone on cruise 
ships. You read that right. One of his favorite 
solutions to overpopulation is sinking all the 
cruise ships, because those are the people you 
want to lose anyway. Making you laugh at such 
jokes is his specialty, and the skill lies in his 
nonchalant, indifferent delivery.
I think Burr is someone the world sorely needs 
right now — someone who makes light of the 
dark parts of the human existence. His style 
of “uniformed logic” forces you to think about 
some of the most fundamental facets of society 
that we take for granted, and whether we all 
just need to take a step back, take it easy, 
and get less offended at all the little things we 
experience in life.

ROOTS OF CREATION 
written by Natalie Schmidt  | Staffwriterlayout by Michelle Madlansacay | Pillbox Editor 
7
Reggae-rock fusion band Roots of Creation is every 
adventurous music lover’s dream. Combining their 
love of Northeast reggae and jam/dub influences, 
the band has masterfully crafted their own stand-
out style in the music scene. Their most recent 
album Grateful Dub released March 9, 2018, 
debuted at no. 1 on the Billboard Reggae chart. 
Featuring artists like Fortunate Youth and Stephen 
Marley, Grateful Dub is an impressive tribute to The 
Grateful Dead with a reggae-dub flavor. To learn 
more about the album and the band, The Tartan sat 
down with lead singer and guitarist Brett Wilson.
Note: Natalie Schmidt is “N,” and Brett Wilson is 
“B”.
N: Are you guys excited to perform in Pittsburgh?
B: Yeah, we’re super excited to come back! It’s 
actually one of our favorite places to play! We 
have a really awesome pocket of fans in Pittsburgh 
and street team guys. We call our fans “RoC 
Family,” and we’ve got a nice crew down there that 
we have a lot of fun with.
N: I read that Roots of Creation got its start in 
college?
B: Yeah, we were just jamming at college parties 
and having a good time. Our first couple of club 
shows sold out too. Everybody’s thats been seeing 
us at parties came and supported us! After college, 
we recorded an album, moved into a house 
together, and just started doing 100-150 shows a 
year, touring the country, and building the fan base 
up organically, grass-roots style.
N: What originally drew you to reggae in 
particular?
B: There’s a nice reggae scene in New Hampshire, 
what people are calling reggae rock or surf 
reggae. It’s a fusion made popular by bands like 
Sublime, Slightly Stoopid, The Clash. One of the 
first times I ever heard reggae music in a live setting 
was at the Vermont Roots Reggae Festival when I 
was really young. Outdoors, people are hanging 
out, eating brownies, smoking. My mom was 
like, “Uh, I don’t know if I should’ve brought you 
here…” (laughs) She used to make me mixtapes 
of reggae music. We traded tastes back and forth, 
and that’s how I got into it. I just really identified 
with the positive message and with a lot of the 
bands that were mixing it into their sound.
N: What drew you all in particular to The Grateful 
Dead?
B: For me, there’s always been a direct line to our 
music and The Dead. I learned how to play guitar 
by listening to Grateful Dead bootlegs, the electric 
guitar solos and acoustic guitar that Jerry Garcia 
did and trying to figure out what he was doing. 
We always teased the idea, it was just always in 
the back of our minds. After Livin Free did really 
well, we were really stoked on it and we were like, 
“Okay, how do we take it to the next level? What 
if we tried this Grateful Dub concept?” We were 
brainstorming and I got introduced to Errol Brown, 
who had done the last three Bob Marley albums. I 
was talking to him and I showed him some stuff and 
he was immediately like, “Let’s do this!” He saw the 
vision! We did about 14 days in the studio, 12 plus 
hour days, and we’d never done that as a band. 
We started to invite all of our friends and have 
our team reach out to people, and it really turned 
into this amazing collaborative project that we’re 
really proud of. Everybody on it knocked it out of 
the park, and we’re just really honored to have the 
support of our fan base and all the special guests. 
The Deadhead community started to embrace it, 
which is really important to me as a fan.
N: What’s something that you guys learned just by 
collaborating with all of these people?
B: I just really think that it takes us off and over 
the top. It takes you out of your comfort zone; you 
might do things your way with your band, but they 
bring their special flavor to it. It’s also cool cause 
it exposes our fan base to their music and their 
band. And, it brings people together in a variety of 
ways. It’s super fun for me, it’s one of my favorite 
things to do! You send the track out and either 
you’re in the studio and watching it unfold, or we 
communicated with the artist and you don’t know 
what it sounds like. And, all of sudden, we get a 
verse back from these people and it’s almost like 
Christmas: you don’t know what it’s going to be, 
and you’re unwrapping it and you’re like, “Woah! 
Look what they did with the art we’re creating!”
N: Was it more of a challenge or an opportunity for 
creative freedom when trying to stay true to The 
Grateful Dead?
B: A lot of the songs just flowed like no problem, 
but there were a couple songs that almost didn’t 
make the record. “Shakedown Street,” wasn’t 
liking any of the vocals that I did, and we ended 
up replacing it with the horns instead to make it 
instrumental. “Standing on the Moon” was tough 
because it’s such a delicate emotional song. It’s 
actually probably my favorite. Once we started 
adding the reggae to it, it felt like that was taking 
something away from it, so Errol started telling us 
the story of “Redemption Song” and recording that 
with Bob Marley — how it just sounded better 
stripped down. And, we said, “Let’s apply that to 
this song.” So we started off the song acoustically 
and gradually brought the band in at the end. Most 
of the other songs I’ve been playing my whole life, 
so it was just a matter of having fun and coming up 
with creative arrangements, making sure the guitar 
and keyboards were always rhythmically skanking 
together. All the things that made a powerful 
sound. It was mostly super fun, especially since we 
didn’t have to write the songs (laughs). They’re 
already iconic, so let’s just have fun rearranging 
these and have an awesome record.
N: What’s coming up for the band that you’re most 
excited about?
B: The touring is super exciting! We’re ready to 
spread our wings and do a couple shows in New 
York and hit Pittsburgh, and then we’re westbound! 
We’re really excited to play Stephen Marley’s 
Kaya festival in California, and in San Diego, we’re 
gonna have Slightly Stoopid playing with us. We’re 
starting to talk about all the new original music we 
have and about who we wanna tour with/open for 
in the fall. Maybe even doing a volume two to this 
Grateful Dub album!
N: How do you want to stand out in the music 
scene?
B: For me, it’s about creating iconic music that 
will stand the test of time. It’s always searching 
to create that piece or body of work that will live 
forever and create a positive impact on the world 
and make people forget about their troubles and 
just have a good time. We’re also just always trying 
to redefine our sound so it’s completely original 
and our own. I‘m always searching for that: 
something so original that when you put it on you 
know exactly who it is.
N: Is there anything you want to say to the fans 
coming to your show?
B: People who might be thinking of coming to the 
show: it’s free! Make sure you reserve your tickets 
‘cause it’s almost sold out, from what I’m hearing! 
Also, if you come out and see the show, make 
sure you come out and say hi to us! We like to 
meet everybody, so stop by the merch table at the 
end, we usually hang out there. Shake our hands, 
give us a hug, and we’re happy to meet you and 
welcome you into the RoC family. Definitely come 
say hi, don’t be afraid!
Roots of Creation will be performing at the Rex 
Theatre on April 14 with Bumpin’ Uglies. For tickets

As a part of Carnegie Mellon’s Sustainability Weekend, 
The Frame Gallery hosted “Everyone is Welcome — An 
Inclusive Sustainability Showcase,” curated by junior 
art major Anna Schulz. The exhibit was held from 
Wednesday, April 4, to Sunday, April 8, and a reception 
was held on Thursday, April 5. Alongside the works from 
Carnegie Mellon students that tackled and combined 
issues about sustainability with issues about diversity and 
masculinity, the reception also featured performances 
from Tribe Eternal, 1Hood Media, Katherine Bussato, 
Javier L.H. Gonzalez, and Samaras, an 11-year-old 
student who recited a poem about sustainability.
The showcase truly embodied its title, Everyone is 
Welcome. Each of the different works masterfully show-
cased the beliefs of the artist behind it, with some of the 
works by different artists even contrasting each other 
at times, making the diversity even more refreshing. 
Additionally, along with the topic of sustainability, it was 
also refreshing to see a wide breadth of social issues 
shown and discussed through the works, making me 
feel like I was learning more not just about the artist but 
about the world around me. All of the art pieces were 
engaging, using a wide variety of materials — such as 
living frogs, red solo cups, and oil — in new and unique

ways that I’d never thought possible, enriching the beauty of 
not only the artwork but also the material used to create it.
Additionally, the talent of the performers was top notch. Tribe 
Eternal and 1Hood Media used their musical platform to truly 
speak about the issues they cared about and were passionate 
about, and did so in such a powerful, engaging, and infec-
tiously entertaining way. They also loved bringing the audi-
ence and crowd along, showering them with their high energy 
and livening the spirit of the whole event. I can’t wait to sup-
port all the artists that were involved on their next ventures, 
and I hope they can carry that mission of activism further on 
in their careers.
Overall, Everyone is Welcome was an astounding success 
that spoke up for not just sustainability, but for racial injustice, 
for toxic masculinity, for pro-choice, and for a lot more social 
issues that the artists and people were passionate about. It 
was a moving, thoughtful, and engaging exhibit that instantly 
made me feel welcomed among a crowd of strangers and 
made me feel more empowered about the world around me.

I know it’s been 
a while since 
Alex Garland’s 
Annihilation 
came out in 
theaters, but 
a friend and 
I decided 
to watch 
it only 
recently. To 
be honest, 
at first I 
didn’t have 
any plans to 
see the movie 
myself. I hadn’t 
seen the trailer 
beforehand 
and I had 
no clue as 
to what the 
movie would 
be about. All I 
knew was that the 
YouTube thumb-
nail for the trailer 
creeped me out, since 
it had a large wolf-like 
creature with big teeth 
standing right behind a distressed-looking 
Natalie Portman. My initial thought was 
that this would be a horror movie, and I 
don’t do horror movies.
I’m the type of person that gets scared 
pretty easily so, not surprisingly, I was 
freaked out by the end of Annihilation. The 
movie is about a former U.S. army soldier 
and cellular biology professor named Lena, 
portrayed by Natalie Portman, who is sent 
to explore and research The Shimmer, a 
mysterious region inhabited by continu-
ously mutating organisms. Almost everyone 
who has gone into The Shimmer in the 
past has never returned, except for Lena’s 
husband, Kane, portrayed by Oscar Isaac, 
who became very ill shortly after. To learn 
more about what happened to her husband 
during his expedition, Lena decides to go 
into The Shimmer with four other female 
researchers. During their time in the area, 
they encounter various mutated versions of 
animals and plants. As they look for a way 
out, they slowly begin to realize that The 
Shimmer causes anything and everything to 
quickly mutate, including themselves.
Something that definitely stood out to 
me when I was watching the movie was 
the talent of the cast. The main cast was 
all female, including Natalie Portman, 
Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa 
Thompson, and Tuva Novotny. Each actress 
brought a unique personality to their char-
acter, which made watching all their inter-
actions on screen even more interesting. 
What I especially found entertaining was 
Gina Rodriguez’s performance as Anya, 
a paramedic who also takes part in the 
expedition into The Shimmer. Her charac-
ter is introduced as very quirky, talkative, 
and likable. However, midway into the 
movie, as The Shimmer has its full effect on 
the characters, it is Anya who especially 
becomes delirious and dangerous to the 
rest of the group. The change in my per-
spective towards Rodriguez’s character was 
surprising and felt very sudden. Overall, 
all the actresses, and especially Rodriguez, 
portrayed their characters very well in the 
movie.
Another thing that I enjoyed about the 
movie was the world that was created for 
The Shimmer. It was so bizarre and yet so 
intriguing. Everything was made to look 
like a dream, with sceneries too good to be 
true but also with many dark places of the 
unknown. Both the film characters and I, as 
the viewer, certainly had no expectations 
while visually exploring The Shimmer, and 
that’s mainly what made my experience 
watching the film so nerve-wracking and 
freakish. The Shimmer’s mimicry of human 
life and nature was, like most things in the 
movie, both beautiful and disturbing. The 
colors and depictions of all the wildlife 
were alluring, while I found the mannerisms 
of The Shimmer’s alien-like humans, as well 
as its effects on the main characters to be 
very creepy.
It’s been a long time since I had seen a 
movie that left me feeling both disturbed 
(in a somewhat good way) and curious; 
the last time was when I was about five 
and I saw Steven Spielberg’s A.I Artificial 
Intelligence. After all those years, I never 
forgot about that movie, and I don’t think 
I’ll ever forget about Annihilation either. 
Alex Garland’s film will surely leave you 
with many questions, both film-related and 
personal. It’s a movie that makes viewers 
think about what exists outside of our lives 
and worlds. If you’re interested in films like 
this one, I definitely recommend seeing it.
Annihilation Review
10
written by Michelle Madlansacay | Pillbox Editorart by Anna Boyle | Art Editor
An unforgettably thought-provoking movie with a talented female cast.

---------------------------------------------------

What does Natalie Portman 
have in common with Mickey 
Rooney, Tilda Swinton, and Scarlett Johansson?
These actors, all of 
whom are white, 
have acted in 
film as charac-
ters who are of 
Asian descent, 
or who are of 
Asian descent 
in the original 
iteration of 
the character.
Rooney’s 
degrading por-
trayal of I.Y. 
Yunioshi, Audrey 
Hepburn’s land-
lord in 1961’s 
Breakfast at 
Tiffany’s, is the 
classic example 
of “yellowface,” the 
portrayal of distinctly 
Asian characters by white 
actors, and the use of racist stereotypes 
in film. In 2016’s Doctor Strange, Swinton plays 
The Ancient One, who was originally Tibetan 
in the comics. For the film, the character was 
“reimagined” as Celtic. Johansson plays Major 
Motoko Kusanagi in 2017’s Ghost in the Shell, 
a live action remake of a Japanese anime film. 
Her casting was a blatant sign of whitewashing 
an Asian character with a white actress.
In this year’s Annihilation, released last 
February, Portman portrays the protagonist 
who is described as a character having part-
Asian descent in the original novels written 
by Jeff VanderMeer. The whitewashing in 
Annihilation has reignited an on-going con-
versation not only about the whitewashing of 
Asian-Americans in the American entertainment 
industry, but the continual racial and cultural 
ignorance that permeates the United States.
As an Asian-American, I am used to not see-
ing myself and characters who look like me 
on screen. I am usually surprised when I see 
an Asian-American character on screen that is 
a speaking, or is a developed character that 
matters. But I am tired of the film industry con-
stantly misinterpreting and ignoring my culture, 
and of the blatant absence of Asian-American 
representation in Hollywood.
According to a 2016 study from the University 
of Southern California’s Annenberg School for 
Communication and Journalism, of all speaking 
or named characters evaluated across film, tele-
vision, and streaming services, only 5.1 percent 
of them were Asian, and at least half of the 
projects had no Asian characters at all.
There is a clear lack of roles for Asian-
Americans in Hollywood. If there are roles, 
particularly high-profile ones, they often go 
to white actors, like Portman. This leads many 
Asian-American actors to either abandon their 
attempts to break into the acting business, or to 
settle for stereotypical and one-note parts that 
service lead characters, who are often white. 
They play IT guys, geeks, prostitutes, if they’re 
present at all. This is not a problem unique to 
Hollywood. Stereotypes in American culture 
consistently reinforce a shallow and hackneyed 
image of Asian-Americans in society.
American society continues to be racially and 
culturally ignorant of Asian-Americans and their 
culture, appropriating their culture without true 
understanding, and reducing them to stereo-
types. Despite the prevalence of the internet 
and the information about other cultures it 
provides, despite a shrinking world that is more 
connected than it ever has been before, despite 
the fact that Asians have been living in America 
since at least the 17th century, there remains 
an underlying sense of otherness — that Asian-
Americans are foreigners and aliens that should 
“Go back to China!”
Not only does this sentiment ignore the many 
Asian-Americans who were born in the United 
States and consume the same culture, eat the 
same food, attend the same schools, and so on, 
but it also overgeneralizes the diversity among 
Asian-Americans themselves. Many are just as 
“American” as any paragon of American 
 identity.
Stereotypes in film reflect the stereotypes of 
society. Asian-American culture and identity 
is often brutally simplified to IT guys, geeks, 
prostitutes, Kung Fu and ninja masters, comic 
relief, or weak, fragile characters, which in 
turn, are depicted on screen. This is not reality. 
Entertainment is an integral part of popular 
culture and, in many ways, directly influences 
social discourse in everyday society.
In 2016, the Academy Awards received intense 
backlash for the lack of diversity among the 
nominees, called #OscarsSoWhite, which 
plagued the build-up to the award ceremony. 
African-American actor and comedian Chris 
Rock was chosen as the host in reaction to the 
controversy, and he spoke extensively about it 
in his opening monologue. Later in the broad-
cast, Rock introduced three Asian-American 
kids dressed in oversized business suits as 
“Academy accountants” in a skit. This was 
planned and written by the ceremony writers 
and executed by Rock. The irony, hypocrisy, 
and tone-deafness of the skit exemplifies how 
people in Hollywood, even those that advocate 
for representation and equality, continue to 
play into stereotypes and be ignorant of Asian-
American identity and culture.
Hollywood’s enduring depiction of these restric-
tive stereotypes about an entire ethnicity is both 
hurtful and detrimental. Asian-Americans, like 
other minorities, are tired of seeing themselves 
flatly portrayed on screen, or not portrayed 
at all. We are tired of being boiled down to 
thinly-drawn roles that are often created solely 
to fit tokenism, a superficial practice of includ-
ing minority characters simply to check off the 
diversity box. We want to see ourselves prop-
erly represented in popular culture. We want to 
have our stories told.
Many have celebrated the diversity and pro-
gressiveness of Annihilation, a science-fiction 
studio film with a predominately female cast, 
including African-American Tessa Thompson 
and Latina Gina Rodriguez. But, does this diver-
sity and progressiveness stop before Asian-
Americans are represented? Casting Thompson 
and Rodriguez is wonderful, but does casting 
them seemingly mean that other minorities can’t 
also be represented — that the minority of the 
lead character that is explicitly described in the 
novels can’t be correctly portrayed?
How is this acceptable, in 2018, when 
Hollywood is (rightfully) beaming in the 
goodwill of Black Panther’s success, which 
celebrates not only diversity and inclusion, 
but an appreciation and understanding of a 
non-white and non-American culture? African-
Americans have been able to finally see them-
selves beyond the basic stereotypes of black 
characters, or in the backdrop of slavery and 
poverty. They have experienced an empower-
ing, representative film that they can relate to. 
This is something I want to see on a movie the-
ater screen, something I, as an Asian-American, 
want to experience. 
Your move, Hollywood.

Custom Made Tire Sandals
eddiebshaw@gmail.com
I have been making sandals for 40 years; 
they are made of leather straps and a 
leather footbed which is nailed to a tire 
sole. I measure each foot and place the 
straps in just the right place for your feet.
They cost $85, will last for years and 
are very comfortable. Get ready for 
the spring/summer. You can text me at 
eddiebshaw@gmail.com, and I will send 
you some pics.

Running from March 17 to April 8, the Miller Gallery featured the new works 
of School of Art Master of Fine Arts candidates Shobun Baile, Alex Lukas, 
KR Pipkin, Gray Swartzel, and Lee Webster.  Inspired by the current political 
climate and expressed through different mediums such as various forms of 
video, 3D models, audio, acryllic, the ive students’ clever and stimulating 
art pieces “examine pop culture fantasies of entertainment, capital, and 
collapse,” showcasing how “a historical cycle of wealth and decay” echoes 
in the present.
From top to bottom: Baile’s Sector 78: A conversation on the 14th loor, 
entries from Swartzel’s mother / me, Pipkin’s Library of Free Objects, Lukas’ 
Marginalia 1-5, Webster’s Dream House and Slow Scan.
