itial meeting last week in Margaret

defeld. The constitution under which 
several of the recent Thistle Boards 
have been operating was adopted by 
the 1922 board. The positi6ns of bus­
iness manager, sales . manager, secre­
tary and treasurer were tben filled 
by election from the members of the 
board. Following this was a discus­
sion of the needs and the policy of the 
next Thistle. All were united in the 
determination to put out the best This­
tle yet published.

QUALIFICATION DAY EXERCISES 
VERY IMPRESSIVE
Borne by six pall bearers, the black 
coffin containing the remains of “old 
man P. R.," headed the long line of 
mourners, of the Plebe classes of the 
four schools. Whether the Plebes 
really mourned the passing away of 
Plebe regulations or not is doubtful, 
but probably everyone in the class 
who carried out the traditions of the 
school during the year feels that he 
was benefitted and has earned the 
right to carry out his duties as a 
Sophomore, and more important, as 
a real Tech man.
The funeral oration, Impressive and 
humorous, was given by Lazarous, a 
Design Plebe. He certainly appeared 
more grief-sticken over the passing 
away of his close friend than the 
I whole Plebe class judging from the 
: text of Mr. Schillinger’s speech of ac­
ceptance.
Justin Lee informed the Plebes as 
to the part they must play in further- 
: ing their interests for the school and 
ushering the next Plebe class into the 
traditions of their Alma Mater.
The traditions of the school- and the 
important part they play in the life 
of the student and the building up of 
the school' were included in a speech 
by H. G. Nichol.
Quoting from Mr. Lazarous "the 
Plebe is no longer a student of hon- 
' ored and distinguished dress.” His 
class link has now been added to the 
ever lengthening chain of Carnegie 
clans. It is up to him to do his part 
in making the link of loyalty to his 
-school as strong as the iron link 
placed in the chain on the black­
smith’s anvil.
The four Plebe class presidents then 
signed the big book, while Old Man 
“P. R.” was burning on his funeral 
pyre and the 1924 link was welded 
onto the Carnegie Chain of ClasseB. 
The PlebeB are now free; free to 
roam, to wear hats, fancy socks and 
loud ties.
BILL PFOUTS TALKS TO
SOPH-PLEBE A88EMBLY
Last Wednesday the Sophs and 
Plebes ha4 an assembly meeting in 
218 Science. C. B. Schmidt opened 
the meeting and after a few remarks 
; introduced Bill Pfouts.
“Bill” proceeded to give a general 
review of conditions at Tech, especi­
ally in regard to traditions and ideals.
: He declared he was there under the 
orders of the Senior Class and bellev- 
ed that the Seniors should be the 
ones to give orders for the betterment 
¡' of the school. He stressed heavily 
the necessity of making new tradi­
tions on the campus particularly in 
regard to the hazing of the Plebes. 
The big-brother act was the thing in­
stead of the present method of init­
iating the incoming Freshmen. Other 
things that he touched upon were the 
class scraps, the development of 
leaders from the classes, and the for­
mulation of the division classes into

IOTA SIGMA DELTA 
WINS SWEEPSTAKES
Thrilling Events Feature Sec­
ond Annual Pushmobile Race
The world's record of the Inter- 
Fratefnity Pushmobile v Sweepstake 
of the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology was broken into bits at the 
second annual race Friday when amid 
the frenzied yelling of vast thrilled 
throngs the fast I. S. D. skeleton, 
traveling at a terrible rate roared 
over- the starting tape only four 
minutes and thirty-eight seconds after 
the race began. The din rose to 
pandemonium when hard on the win­
ners' heels the powerful G. M. E. 
machine went by the flag, in turn 
closely pursued by the X. Z. U. ma­
chine which took an easy third. Thus 
ended the most thrilling race ever 
held on th'e fast Tech speedway.
The day was ideal. The dull lead­
en clouds of early morning were 
chased away by smiling forces of 
a pleasant sun. Already at ten 
o’clock the crowd began to gather, 
and the music of the band and the 
roaring of motors and the squawking 
of horns and wonderfully dresBed 
women lent overwhelming color to the 
gay event. One by one the con­
testants appeared in their hopes 
most various and unique. Some had 
lines of unquestioned speed, others 
.bad lines of unquestioned beauty. 
The cars were lined up on the 
epcedway with the Arts Building 
making a rich background and the 
crowds gathered about them to ad­
mire the novelty of their designs, 
the grace of lines and the fineness 
of workmanship. It was great fun 
too, to see the officials come around 
with a little fifty-pound scale, pick 
them up and weigh them to see if 
they were heavy enough to qualify, 
fifty pounds being the minimum. 
After that the judges of the com­
mittee studied each car carefully for 
looks and after much deliberation the 
exatraordinarly unique D. U. Fish was 
awarded first prize and the funny lit­
tle “Toonervllle Trolley” grown out 
of the fertile minds of the S. N. 
men received honorable mention. The 
“Trolley” had a terrible scare when 
one of those rip-roaring army trucks 
that roam around our campus almost 
did not stop when the ‘Tnterurban” 
attempted to cross in front of it. 
The girls gasped and brave men 
yelled and it was only by such as-

COUNCIL HOLDS BUSY MEETING
A report was read from Dean 
Tarbell at the Student Council meet­
ing this week to the effect that the 
Point System with one exception, 
bad been approved by the Education­
al Council and referred to the Ad­
ministration Council. The exception 
was that part whch referred to the 
minimum number of points for grad­
uation. Further information regard­
ing how this would be handled by 
the Student Council was desired.
The Commencement Week Commit­
tee made a report through Chairman 
Wallace. All of the plans for the 
distribution of the week’B activities 
have been made and are progressing 
in a satisfactory manner.
The Ring Committee recommended 
two designs to be considered. 'Fur­
ther recommendations were that the 
ring should be six and eight penny­
weight, that it should be strictly a 
degree ring worn only by graduates 
In degree courses, and that the stone 
should be an amethyst.
It was decided on motion that the 
respective school senates should be 
.made responsible for the scholastic 
standing of all non-athletic officers. 
The council also decided to petition 
the Administrative Council that two 
hours be allowed for general assem­
blies next year, and to petition the 
Educational Council for presentation 
on' that body from the Four Schools 
Council.
The Thistle Board is to edit all 
Senior activities for publication 1n 
the Thistle and is to make a. stand­
ard list of such activities.
Th* four schools' nominees for 
presiaent of next year’s council 
were present at the meeting in order 
that the present council might be­
come acquainted with them. _
Campus Week turned out two de­
cisive victories for the tennis team. 
Captain- Harkness successfully led 
his team against the teams of Beth­
any College and Washington and 
Jefferson. In neither one of these 
tournaments waB there much compe­
tition—Tech outclassing, out-general- 
ing and out-guessing all the way 
through.
Tartain Net Men Defeat Bethany.
The Carnegie Tech tennis team 
took into fold the team from Beth- 
eny College to the tune of all six 
matches to nothing. Never at any 
time was the result In doubt. With­
out a single exception the Tech play­
ers out-played, out-generaled, and 
out-guessed the men from the WeBt 
Virginia school. There was no out­
standing star for Tech; each and 
every one of them playing the best, 
if such a classification is possible.
The order of play wag Kell, play­
ing number one. He defeated Ford 
Bethany’s number one man 6-1, 6-1. 
Kell showed a vastly improved 
serve, and a drive that landed in 
‘the corners time and time again. He 
won handily by taking the center of 
the court, and volleying to the side. 
Ford shows good serve, but he failed 
to take the net, thus falling easy 
prey to Keil's execution of the fam­
ous center-court theory of play.
Schwartz defeated Blue of Beth­
any 6-1, 6-2. Schwartz Avon out by 
generally outplaying his opponent.
Neville next defeated Meacham of 
Bethany 6-1, 6-2. Neville continued 
his terrific driving game, and for 
that reason exhibited some of the 
prettiest tennis of the day. Neville 
if perhaps one of he prettiest tennis 
players ever to have represented 
Carnegie Tech on the courts, and, 
he puts across the victories too!
Schmertz playing the last singles 
match for Tech defeated Reeves of 
Bethany 6-1, 6-2. Schmertz played 
his usual bewildering game, and It 
is no wonder he won his match 
from Reeves? because even those 
players who are accustomed to play­
ing against him daily find it almost 
impossible to beat him.
In the other doubles, and final 
Tech’s premier doubles team defeat­
ed. Blue and Ford 6-1, 6-1. Their 
team work showed a vast improve­
ment over their last appearance. 
This coupled with the poor team­
work of the Bethany team paved the 
way for the Tech victory.
In the other docbles, and final 
match, Harkness and Schmertz de­
feated Bemis and Reeves 6-0, 6-1. 
Team work again winning out over 
a team who plays mostly as indi­
vidual men.
Colonel Brooks has developed a 
first class team^ and should give a 
good account of itself against any 
college team in the country. The in­
dividual players show wonderful 
headwork, and good strokes, while 
the doubles teams show -that wonder­
ful teamwork which is so evident 
in all of Colonel Brook’s teams.
The W-J. Game.
The story of the Bethany match 
has already been told, and it only 
remains to tell the glorious story of 
the Wash.-Jeff meet.
In this match, Carnegie won five 
matches to one for Wash-Jeff. Kell 
showed himself to be In a class al­
most by himself by defeating tho 
veteran Garblsch. GarbJscli . has 
played four years as Wasli-Jeff’s num­
ber one man, and today is ranked as 
one of the best tennis players In this 
district. Keil took him- over to the 
tune of 6-4, 6-4. The feature of this 
match was the wonderful net play 
of Keil, at which position he cut 
down time and time aeain wonder-

night the Union and Langley Labora­
tory was packed to full capacity.

program on account of the disa­
greeable weather.
The crowd was vory congenial and 
gayly mingled, throwing confetti and 
mixed continually. Artistech and

SIDE SHOWS VERY FUNNY
One of the largest crowds that has 
assembled 011 the athletic field was 
present at the circus last Saturday 
night. Many Pittsburgh people, adult« 
and children, were in evidence. The 
show started with a parade, led by 
the band, followed by performers, cir­
cus vehicles, horses and trained ani­
mals. The animals consisted of a 
giraffe, some bears, monkeys and an 
olephant, represented by students. 
The first stunt was the animal per­
formance in which was shown a re­
markable degree of intelligence, as­
tonishing even to the faculty. The 
clowns began to become conspicuous 
and croated much comedy throughout 
the entire show and kept up action 
to keep the program from dragging. 
The drama act was a comical sketch 
of a Plobe who recently arrived from 
tho tall grass to soelc knowledge. His 
ambitions, desires wore contrasted 
with the handicaps and difficulties, by 
characters portrayod in a vory humor­
ous manner. Tho horseback potato 
raco was fairly exciting, but rather 
slow; somewhat funny, but had tho 
riders been In clown costumes it 
would havo been much bettor. The 
tight wire act recolvod a good ap­
plause considering that It was vory 
dlillcult to do a good wire walk on ac­
count of tho confusing lighting. Tho 
chariot raco was a aoroam. Thoro 
wore two entries, Bon Ilur and Bon

spectacular playing by defeating 
Ramsey and Alexander 6-1, 6-1. This 
team is destined to set the colle­
giate circles afire before their ac­
tive playing days are past. The ter­
rific driving of Neville, coupled with 
the splendid net work of Keil, makes 
a team that is practically indofeata- 
ble.
In the final doubles match, Hark- 
ness and Schmertz took over Gar- 
biscli and Knoepp in the hard match 
of 8-6, 6-2. Teamwork did It more 
than anything elso.
Our nexl match is with West Vir­
ginia, on Wednesday afternoon, May 
18. Everybody out to cheer, applaud 
nnd urge the Carnegie Tech tennis 
teami on to victory. Now that W. & 
J. has boon disposed of very suc­
cessfully, West Virginia looms up as 
our hardest match of the season. 
Down In Morgantown our team was 
only able to return a 3*3 tie score. 
They have a man down there who 
defeated our incomparable ICeil, 
which In Itself ought to draw out 
another rocord gallery. Keil is out 
for a victory and rovonge. Manager 
Pitts advises that the West Virginia 
team consists of all good men, and 
further states that the teams are as 
evonly matched as two teams possi­
bly could bo.
Bill Says
Dear "Bill”:
In view of the sentiment that luis 
been crystallzlng in favor of a "Big 
Brother” movement, I would like to 
say a few things regarding such a 
move. In spite of all the arguments 
put forth In favor of "Plebe Regula­
tions," that they add to college spirit 
and all that sort of thing, there aro a 
large number of men driven from 
Tocli evory year because of dissatis­
faction in regards to the treatmont 
given them. I would not go so far as 
to lay tills fooling entirely to "Plebe 
Regulations,” but the fact remains 
that wo are falling In the biggest part 
of our work, liamoly, that of making 
every studont lovo Tech so much that 
he is sure to come back and support 
the Alina Mater with all that ho has.
Now, wo have tried the ono plan 
over since Tech has boon in exist­
ence, so why not try the other? Rec­
ord s of the school prove that men are 
quitting Tech ovory. year, but there is 
no proof (hat Tocli spirit Is any great- 
oi‘ than that of schools In which there 
aro no regulations. So, why not 
groot every man next year as a broth-' 
or, as if he woro absolutely ossontlal 
to tho school instead of Just so much 
more material for n Roman festival? 
Why not got acquainted with them, 
help them to got located, find out 
their ability In various linos, such as 
athletics, debating, or what not, and 
got them placed in such activities as 
they are fitted for?
If such a thing is to be tried, some­
body must take the first step. To 
start the movement going, the Sine 
Nomine pledges that each of its mem­
bers will meot and make welcomo at 
least one new student next year. The 
views of other organizations interest­
ed in the subject uro earnestly re­
quested.
Yours respectfully,
SINE NOMINE CLUB.

ful drives of Garbisch’s. In the sec­
ond set, with 4-0 against him, Keil 
came back, and won six straight 
games, thereby winning the set 6-4.
Neville put to rest once and for 
all times tlie claims that Stockslager 
of last year’s championship team was 
a better number two man than him, 
by administering a 6-1 6-0 defeat
to Randall, who last year twice de 
feated Stockslager. Neville In turn­
ing this feat, exhibited some of the 
prettiest and most effective driving 
ever seen on tho Teeli tennis courts 
since tho days of LeGros t,pf Syra­
cuse.
.Captain I-Iarknoss staged a neat 
comeback in his match with Knoepp, 
by dofoating hinn 7-5, 6-4. I-Iarknoss 
played Ills usual gamo of always 
fighting, and ovor giving his very 
best for Carnegie Tech. ills vic­
tory came mainly through out-genor- 
nling his opponent.
Schwartz playod somewhat off- 
form and as a result lost tho only, 
match of tho day for Carnogio Tocli, 
when Alexander of W. & J. defeat-. I 
od him 6 0. 7 5. Schwartz gave the! 
very best ho had in him at the time, | 
and he Is to bo especially commend­
ed for his gamo fight In tho last set. 
which was carried to 7-5.

foil to pieces, oxposfng tho Plebes to 
tho unsuspecting audienco. Doc 
Spoor, tho high) diver, thrilled the' 
crowd by riding a. bicycle on the par­
apet; of tho top of tho M. M. D. build­
ing; also by balancing on one leg over 
the edge. He completed his stunt 
by jumping from the room into eigh­
teen inches of water. The volunteer 
fire department showed themselves 
up when the old homestead caught 
fire. The foundation was saved.
Cummings and Clark gave a good 
exhibition of wrestling. The bout 
ended in a draw. The horizontal bar 
act was exceptionally interesting. The 
last thing of the main circus was the 
exhibit by the electrical department. 
Ner-s Irwin very dexterously handled 
about a million volts; rather shock­
ing. \
Following the big show was the 
side issues. Many wonders and curi­
osities were seen on the inside. The 
roaring lion, snake charmer, wild 
man, cigaret fiend, hula dancer, Cleo, 
the queen of the Nile, the glass eater 
and Gloomo, the man who seldom 
smiles.
The circus closed the Campus Week 
activities ,and was the biggest event 
on the program. There is no reason 
to believe that everyone didn’t get 
their money’s worth, for it was one 
big laugh.

aistnnco that, the machine survives.
After the awarding of the boauty 
prizes a phrado hoadcd by tho banil 
marched about the campus and as 
tfoon as. tho crowds could bo roped 
back, the olghtoon contestants woro 
arranged on tho starting lino In front 
of the Library, six nbroast and three 
deep.
At tho crack of tho gun they wore 
off and the crowds received on- 
thrill on top of another. At the ver»- 
first turn directly in front of tho M 
M. D.. three spoedlng machines were 
cr.ucrht in a jam and the crashing of 
timber nnd the • shrieking of the 
crews stilled the blood of the on­
lookers. It was only by some 
atrange kindness of fate that the 
men received only scratches instead 
of serious injury. There by skillful 
driving and by an unparalleled burst 
of speed tho S. A. E. forged to the 
front and gradually gained a comfort­
able lead, and crossing the top oi 
the hill started down the boulevard 
at a terrific -clip. HoWever, ab the 
fish-pond the jinx got them; their 
steering apparatus went bad and .the 
machine, becoming unmanageable 
headed straight for a tree. It crash­
ed into the- curb and removed two 
wheels as prettily as one would 6are 
to see. Wilson, and "Ted,” his 
mechanic, were hurled through the 
air and after they landed the wreck j 
landed on top of them pinning them, 
to this hard world. And thus they 
remained until rescued.
With the S. A. E. out the I. S. D. 
crew went into first place and held J 
it to the finish. The crowd which 
after the start had run breathlessly 
to Flag Staff I-Iill In order to watch’ 
the race down the boulevard, rushed 
back again as soon as the first ma­
chine rolled around into the main 
entrance of Tech, and the yells of 
a thousand throats cheered the vic­
torious I. S. D., which crossing the 
line 4:38 after the race began set 
a new record for the Great Tech 
Pushmoblle Sweepstake. The G. M. 
Z. took second place with time 4:42^. 
while the X. S. U. finished thircC 
time 5:04.
superstitions About Birds.
It has always been deemed unlucky 
by the superstitious to kill a robin 
or a swallow.. In some lands the ill 
luck If the killing be accidental, la 
canceled if burial Is given to the 
bird. Swallows are accounted sacred 
because they flew around the cross 
of Calvary.
Original "Buccaneers."
The term "buccaneer” originated on 
the Island of Tortuga. It Is derived 
from the French word describing men 
who cured meat by the "boucan” proc­
ess, a system of smoking the flesh 
on green sticks.

At the Theatres
THE DAVIS
III tho program of Keith vaudeville 
al, the Davis Theater, beginning 
Monday afternoon, May 23, tliore will 
be all tho elements of varied theat­
ricals. its feature will be Billy B. 
Van and James J. Corbett, in their 
spirited travesty entitled "The 
Eighteenth Amendment.” Another 
notable feature of the bill will be 
the first appearance here of Solly 
Ward, and his associate players, 
with Marion Murray. Mr. Hyinack, 
"The Chameleon Comedian," is ’the 
third of the bill’s headline attrac­
tions. He is a noted Englishman 
who is regarded as the world's great­
est quick change artist. Pittsburgh­
ers saw him a decade or more ago 
at the Grand. This will be his first 
time at the Davis. In a skit called 
"At Bogey Villa” he will reveal his 
amazing facility for changing his ap­
pearance and his apparel.
THE GRAND
The love lom and the seeker after 
matrimony will find some splendid 
advice as well as delicious enter­
tainment in Constance Talmadge’s 
latest photoplay, "Lessons in Love," 
which will be at the Grand all next 
week, starting Monday morning, May 
23, It offers hints to the heart­
broken, treat-’em-rough tuition for 
pale-faced pacifists and a- complete 
coin'se for blushing beaux. "Lessons 
in Love,” is founded upon Douglas 
Murray's speaking stage play, "The 
Man From Toronto,” offered in this 
country by Henry Miller under the 
name of "Perkins.” It concerns the 
doings of two young persons who 
"refused" to fall in lovo with each 
other, and then found that fate was 
too much against them.

Instruction This Year—DividoH 
Into Three Groups.Grove City College last Thursday 
took the highest count in the game 
with the 'Skibo nine, defeating the 
Scotchmen by the score of 5 to 4.
The third inning decided the game, 
the Grove City sluggers went on a 
rampage and scored four runs. In the 
last inning the Tech boys found their 
old time form and scored two runs.
The crowd attending the game was 
a large one, this contest being the first 
of the events of Campus Week on the 
Tech field.
The lineup:
Numerous hits and runs scored 
featured the game when Tech was out­
distanced by tho Buclmell nine, Fri­
day, the score being 9-11.
The teams kept fairly even in scor­
ing and hitting, which caused the 
playing of an extra inning. Bucknell 
scored 16 hits. Tech 13.
In the numerous hits made there 
were five three-base hits made during 
the game, three by Tech men.
A large crowd enjoyed the game, tho 
stadium was filled, and the Tech band 
enlivened the occasion with their jazz 
music.
A school for cuddles will be opened 
at (he St. Louis Country club this year 
and failure to attend will mean new

tures famous. The average individ­
ual has no Idea of what intricacies 
aro Involved in movlo settings. What 
appears satisfying to the eye will not 
please after being photographed. The 
scene must be conceived by the mas­
ter mind of tho producer; and then 
tho art director is the Interpreter who 
makes It a reality. Color is also es­
sential in these scones because with­
out it tho natural texture cannot be 
gotten. Other requirements are tho 
harmonizing tho costumes, architec­
ture and furniture with tho action. lie 
must be fumlliar with the effects 
lights have on textiles for the camera. 
Ho must make sketches and models 
before the seeds can bo approved and 
built .

Word for Jude Johnson.
We wish to say a kind word for 
Jude Johnson: He is not one or those 
hypocrites who have beautiful front 
yards and very dirty and unsightly 
back yards. His front yard Is every 
bit as dirty as his back yard.—Atchi­

- First Phonograph Disk.
The first phonographic disk Is still 
in existence, in the Smitlisoniao In­
stitution at Washington. It was 
made in 1887, by Emil Berliner, and 
the first song sung on a phonographic 
disk was “The Sweetest Story Ever 
Told.”
The original disk that Berliner ex­
perimented with Is of glass. A coat 
of soot-was rubbed over the surface. 
The revolution of the machine caused 
the needle to scratch the sound into 
the glass, and thus make lines. Thus 
the voice of a person singing Into the 
horn was accorded. From it a ztac 
disk was then made, and a copper 
matrix was the uext step. From the 
matrix all records were casL Thirty- 
four years ago all finished records 
were of rubber. Today the finished 
record Is made of various chemical 
compositions, with a good proportion 
of rubber.
There were five steps In casting the 
Grst disks, whereas today only three 
steps are necessary. First, ¿here is 
the wax disk, which records the voice. 
Then the matrix Is cast, and finally 
the complete record.

Inconsistent.
It Is one of the Inconsistencies of 
man that he will make laws to pro­
tect the deer, surround the partridge 
with game regulations, compel the 
fisherman to respect the small fish, 
and yet allow the ruthless destruction 
of the home In which these wild things 
live.—American Forestry Magazine.
Burke's Idea of Statesman.
A disposition to preserve, and an 
ability to Improve, taken together, 
would be my standard of a statesman. 
—Edmund Burke.
"Expectation" Dream.
To dream that you expect some one 
and he comes denotes you are safe, 
In thé course you are pursuing, hut 
If he does not come, then your course 
Is unwise nnd you should chnntre.
Wonderful Farm Maohinery.
The first mower was invented In 
1832, but few were used for many 
years. Now one man with the average 
mower can cut 12 to 15 acres in a 
day, Instead of two with a scythe. 
The cost of haudling is vastly reduced 
with the use of the present slde-de- 
llvery rake, self-loader and hay fork 
for unloading.
In 1834 the reaper was Invented but 
did not come into general use for 20 
years after. Then came the self-rake 
harvester, nnd the self-binder. The 
modern self-binder with one man nnd 
three horses can cut and bind as mucn 
grain In a day as 15 men could do 
In 1840. Even greater efficiency is se­
cured in very dry sections where the 
combined harvester Is used, which 
cuts, threshes and »acks the grain in 
one operation.
Something Wrong.
Frederick had his fifth birthday. Be­
ing used to a little celebration on those 
events In the family, he thought this 
one dull, as nothing but a birthday 
cake marked the day. The following 
day he said: “Mother, didn’t you for­
get to send out birthday cards?"
Patching Hole«.
Sifted coal ashes, sand and wheat 
flour, mixed with water, make an ex­
cellent mortar for patching holes when 
the plaster Is broken. Use two parta 
ashes and sand to one of flour.
