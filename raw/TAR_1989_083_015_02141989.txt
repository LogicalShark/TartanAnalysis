“It seems to me that the trustees and 
the faculty are not going to let stu­
dents outright have a lot of influ­
ence. t
y Sophomore Marc Roston
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan News Editor
After three weeks of debate and 
controversy between Student 
Senate and Student Government 
President Andy Robitshek, the 
student committee to provide 
input on President Cyert’s suc­
cessor is ready to meet.
The committee — which repre­
sents a compromise between 
Senate and Robitshek—includes 
the following undergraduates: 
Kishore Rao (CIT), Kim McGraw 
(MCS), Ingrid Bromberg (CFA),
Marc Roston (H&SS), Carlos 
Franco (IM), Doug Cervenak 
(Council of Fraternity Presi­
dents), Keisha Watson (Spirit), 
Bryan Wong (Student Dormitory
Council), Trina Pundurs (Gay and 
Lesbian Alliance), and Debbie 
Sinn (Panhel). The group will 
meet for the first time on Thurs­
day.
The five academic representa­
tives— Rao, McGraw, Bromberg, 
Roston, and Franco—were picked 
by Robitshek from a pool of four 
names in each category selected 
by Senate out of 22 interested 
students who appeared at last 
Tuesday’s Senate meeting.
“I know what this school is lack­
ing and what we need more of,” 
McGraw, a sophomore biology 
major, told Senate. “The schools 
now are very separated. MCS 
people do not talk to CFA people, 
and H&SS doesn’t get along with 
CIT. We need a more unified
campus, and I think the new 
president should work towards a 
unified CMU.”
“We can have all these great 
ideas, but it seems to me that the 
trustees and the faculty are not 
going to let students outright have 
a lot of influence,” sophomore 
economics major Roston said. “The 
goal we have to have is to work to 
get as much influence as possible.” 
An original committee set up by 
Robitshek included representa­
tives from eight large campus 
organizations—Activities Board,

Amid confusion, 
Beaux Arts Ball 
debate rages on
By KARL BARNHART
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Despite meeting almost every day for the last week, 
students and administrators have not decided where 
CFA’s Beaux Arts Ball — scheduled for March 11 — will 
be held and are considering off-campus locations.
Although the CFA building has not been ruled out 
entirely, the Ball will probably be held at the Metropol, 
Zack’s Bar, Vic’s, the Wightman School, or Motor Square 
Garden, ending an 80-year-old CFA tradition. The Ball 
will be held on-campus only if it is completely dry, 
according to Dean of Student Affairs Brad Walter.
This announcement follows a Walter memo, dated 
January 30, which virtually cancelled the Ball, calling it 
an uncontrollable event andbarringit from CFA because 
“no faculty member or administrator is willing to take the 
responsibility for the successful management of alcohol.”
Because of a University policy passed since the 1985 
Ball and a state law passed just last March, someone 
must file a form with Student Affairs taking responsibil­
ity for any on-campus event where alcohol is served. 
Neither the Beaux Arts Ball Committee — eight CFA 
students organizing this year’s Ball — nor Student Af­
fairs are willing to sign this form.
Committee Chair Troy Lambert, a senior art major, 
feels the administration is shirking its responsibility to

At least 3 professors dispute 
charges made in Grey Matter
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan Assistant News Editor
SEI protestor Vincent Eirene 
held an informal press conference 
in Grey Matter Thursday in which 
he released the names of five CMU 
professors who he claimed have 
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) 
related research contracts.
Eirene, well known at CMU for 
his protest activities against the 
Software Engineering Institute 
(SEI), named Professors Doug 
Jensen, H. T. Kung, Daniel P. 
Siewiorek, Zary Segall, and David 
Casasent as beinginvolved in SDI- 
funded research. Eirene distrib­
uted a pamphlet listing the names 
of all five professors and the office 
phone numbers of all except 
Jensen, but said, “This is not so 
that everybody can call them up 
and harass them. This is so that
we can call them up and ask them 
exactly what they are doing.” 
Claiming that “seventy percent 
of the research at Carnegie Mel­
lon University is funded by the 
Department of Defense,” Eirene 
said, “we are asking students to 
put pressure on the administra­
tion to get these military con­
tracts off campus.”
Eirene cited Provost Angel 
Jordan as the source of his infor­
mation. Jordan confirmed that he 
provided the list to Eirene. “He 
got the names of the professors 
from me,” Jordan told The Tar­
tan. Jordan called the list “cor­
rect and complete.”
Kung, however, told The Tar­
tan that it is“not true” that he is 
currently working on any SDI 
contracts. When askèd if he meant 
that he had done so in the past, or 
might in the future, Kung said
purported to be involved in research funded by SDI Thursday.
that a “complicated” process is 
involved in “how the money gets 
channeled.”
• Kung claimed that he had not 
been contacted by Eirene and said 
that “anyone who wishes to make
such claims should call me di­
rectly to confirm them. Otherwise, 
he has very little credibility.” 
Siewiorek told The Tartan, “I 
believe the contract Eirene is 
referring to terminated two years
ago.” Siewiorek said that the 
contract had to do with what he 
called “ballistic missile defense,” 
but that the project was general 
and has since been used in appli­
cations for the air traffic control 
industry and NASA.
Siewiorek went on to say that 
he and Segall held the contract 
“before SDI came around” but that 
the “money was re-labelled” be­
cause “some people felt SDI was a 
bargaining chip.” About Eirene, 
Siewiorek said, “I don’t know who 
he is, or what he’s doing, but I’m 
willing to listen to him if lie’s 
willing to listen to me.” Siewiorek 
«aid that Eirene hadn’t contacted 
him.
When told by The Tartan that 
his name had been revealed by 
Eirene the day before, Segall 
replied, “That’s a surprise.” He 
confirmed Siewiorek’s state­
ments, saying that “Eirene is 
talking about a project that’s 
history. It ended two years ago.” 
Segall referred to the project as

Freshmen at last year's Freshman Camp 
enjoy a giant banana split.
By TONY BRUSSEAU
Tartan Staffwriter
Brad Walter, dean of Student Affairs, 
expects to make his final decision regard­
ing the fate of next semester’s Freshman 
Camp by February 24.
Walter created a committee of adminis­
trators and students to explore the follow­
ing possibilities for Freshman Camp: 
•requiring the entire class to attend; 
•separating the class into half and 
having camp at different times;
•holding camp after an on-campus ori­
entation;
•eliminating camp; or
•having a one-day-only camp.
Student Ombudsman Michael Murphy, 
a member of Walter’s committee, explains 
that the committee is important because 
it revisits orientation as a whole to deter­
mine what goals it wants to accomplish 
and how to best tailor orientation around 
these goals.
About half of the freshman classes of 
previous years actually chose to attend 
camp. One reason for the proposed 
changes to freshman camp is the desire 
for all students to share the same experi­
ence.
Another reason cited for the elimina­
tion of camp or for requiring it universally
is so that the University can concentrate all 
of its resources in one location instead of 
trying to maintain both an on- and off-cam- 
pus orientation as in past years.
According to Aileen Jaitin, a counselor at 
last semester’s camp and an MCS junior, 
significantly changing camp would be a mis­
take. The freshmen, said Jaitin, would not 
gain nearly as much if they had less time to 
make acquaintances at camp, were required 
to attend camp, or stayed on-campus where 
they could easily choose not to attend the 
scheduled activities.

are run, rather than whether there is a camp

None of the slots in the new dormitory will 
be offered during room draw because of de­
lays, according Director of Housing Anthony 
Martin. The dorm, located in the east part of 
campus, was planned to have housed 302 
residents next fall.
While many of the rooms will be completed 
by the fall, the site around the dorm will not 
be ready. The University is concerned that 
the students would not be safe living in the 
dorm until the site is finished. One major 
safety concern is that fire trucks would not be 
able to reach the dorm.
The design of the dorm, notits construction, 
has been the major cause of the delay. The 
construction has encountered few weather 
delays. Fear of any additional delays, such as 
those caused by weather, prompted Housing 
to pull the dorm from the room selection 
process.
In January, Martin believed that the west 
wing would be ready by the fall and the east 
wing a month later. The dorm will consist of 
separate wings, which will be connected 
underground.

The University has officially opened the Center for Integrated 
Manufacturing Decision Systems. The Center is devoted to 
developing software that will improve productivity and product 
quality and reduce the time invested in product development. 
Such efforts are needed if U.S. manufacturers are going to 
compete with the Japanese, says Mark Fox, the center’s Direc­
tor.
In the automobile industry, for example, the cycle from initial 
design to final product is as long as six years for domestic auto 
manufacturers, compared to two or three years for Japanese 
auto makers. More than 60 people are working at the center’s 
seven research laboratories, including five visiting researchers 
from Europe and Japan.

Charter airline 
crash raises 
safety concerns
NEW YORK (DJ) — Even 
though investigators have yet to 
determine the cause of the down­
ing of a U.S. charter jetliner in 
the Azores Islands Wednesday, 
the crash has renewed concerns 
among safety officials over the 
difficulty of monitoring the safety 
of charter airlines.
Although charter airlines must 
adhere to the same regulations as 
major carriers, the standards at 
each may vary greatly, the safety 
officials said. The most recent 
regulatory action against Inde­
pendent Air, the Smyrna, Tenn., 
company that owned the Boeing 
707 that crashed into a mountain 
in the Azores, was an $18,000 fine 
related to training violations in 
1984, says the FAA.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, 
according to State Department

The Tokyo talks will be held 
when Bush and the two Arab 
leaders attend the funeral of 
Emperor Hirohito of Japan.
Details of the separate visits to 
Washington by Hussein, Mubarak 
and Shamir will be worked out 
over the next few weeks.
The main topics are expected to 
include the future of restive Pal­
estinians on the Israeli-held West 
Bank and in Gaza, and the role 
the U.S. will try to play in settling 
the 40-year-old Arab-Israeli con­
flict.

Nuclear waste dump 
scheduled to open
WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. 
Joe Skeen (R., N.M.) unveiled a

The measure, co-sponsored by

was also designed to end a politi­
cal impasse between the Energy 
Department and the states of 
Idaho and Colorado that threat­
ens to force the closing of a nu-

The bill would give jurisdiction 
of more than 10,000 acres of fed­

which is seeking to gain safety 
clearance to open the Waste Iso­
lation Pilot Plant. The waste 
dump was scheduled to open last

WASHINGTON (DJ) —The ad-

an attempt by the Justice Depart­
ment to stop the proceedings out 
of concern that more stringent 
controls should be placed on 
North’s plans to produce exten­
sive amounts of classified mate­
rial in his defense.
The Justice Department wants 
a court order saying that Oliver 
North cannot disclose any .classi­
fied information unless it is 
plicitly approved by the court am 
if the government has no objec 
tion to the disclosure.
Independent Counsel Lawrena

‘This is not a trial of nationa

On Jan. 19, Gesell ruled tha

Student Senate is considering 
ti expansion of the CMU shuttle/ 
scort service. According to Mark 
tfittelhauser, chair of Senate’s 
ampus affairs committee, three 
ptions are currently being dis­
ussed: A 24-hour escort service, 
route to Squirrel Hill, and an 
jgreement with PAT.
The most promising change is 
evising the escort service to a 24- 
l0Ur one, a change that would 
ist approximately $11,000 an- 
,ually. The Squirrel Hill option 
fould require the purchase of a 
ew shuttle costing $30,000 with 
perational costs running at 
50,000 yearly. This option, along 
,jth any arrangements with PAT, 
j-e questionable at the moment. 
As Mittelhauser discussed, a 
tudent Senate survey conducted 
ast year revealed complaints 
bout the current escort system 
ut did not offer any real solu- 
ions. “This semester we will offer 
new questionnaire so that we
can move in the direction of ac­
commodating students’ needs 
with university facilities.”
According to Student Ombuds­
man Michael Murphy, the expan­
sion of the escort service is being 
considered in conjunction with 
other efforts including expanding 
the hours of the Hunt Library. 
“Senate will develop a survey to 
look at the services on campus, 
try to access the demand present 
and see how this need correlates 
with the costs.”
The changes being discussed 
present a running issue in Senate 
and are also being addressed by 
the President’s Student Advisory 
Council.
The current shuttle service runs 
from 7:00 am to 12:00 am Monday 
through Friday and 10:00 am to 
12:00 am Saturday to Sunday. 
The shuttle service travels from 
Skibo to a variety of off-campus 
locations and has three different 
routes.
The Escort service runs from 
6:30 pm to 3:30 am Sunday though 
Thursday and 6:30 pm to 2:30 am

on Friday'to Saturday and trans­
ports students on a request basis.
According to Sergeant .Ricci of 
Campus Security, for the 1988-89 
fiscal year, it is estimated that 
the shuttle/escort system will 
drive over 62,000 miles transport­
ing over 194,000 miles.
In Ricci’s opinion, the escort 
system provides a very good serv­
ice to Carnegie Mellon, and if 
funds and vehicles can be ar­
ranged, the expansion would 
“better serve the University com­
munity ... the escort service offers 
a protective service, not just a 
free ride.”
An escort-dispatcher pointed 
out changing the service might 
not be necessary because addi­
tional work-study students would 
have to be hired and there “are

Regardless, according to Mit­

Engineering students to repair the Fence
ly NATALIE CAPONE
'artan Staffwriter
The Fence, which has been
lowly deteriorating due to rot- 
ing wood, will soon be repaired 
the Carnegie Mellon student 
lapter of the American Society 
f Civil Engineers (ASCE). Re­
airs will include replacing the 
posts nearest Doherty Hall, 
nd the four rails attached.
While additional repairs may 
e needed at a later time, as much 
f the original fence as possible 
rill be left intact.
Comprised of approximately 25 
vil engineering students, the 
SCE will be led by senior Eric 
riedman, vice president of the 
[roup. In an initial proposal, it 
[as suggested that Physical Plant 
¡pair the fence. But when the 
SCE, under the supervision of 
vil engineering professors, vol- 
nteered to undertake the proj­
it, their offer was accepted.
“I think it
makes sense to
have students
fix the fence,”
said Student
Government
President Andy
Robitshek, who
pushed to have
the student
group selected. _. _ .. ...r „ The Fence earlier this year,^he Fence is
something students identify with.
It’s our fence.”
“Every year the ASCE does 
some sort of construction proj­
ect,” said Friedman. “And this 
year we thought it would be nice 
to help the school.” Previous ASCE 
projects include a hydrology study 
of Schenley Park for the City of 
Pittsburgh.
Friedman anticipates that af­
ter gathering materials and work­
ing out the logistics, the work 
should be completed in a week­
end. “We’re aiming to have the
Tartan file photo
Fence fixed before Spring Carni­
val.”
Robitshek said that it has not 
yet been decided what will hap­
pen to the pieces of the fence that 
are removed. “I’d like to see some 
of the parts donated to Scotland 
Yard to be displayed, and I also 
hope that the remaining pieces 
will be made available to any 
member of the University com­
munity that would like them. The 
committee formed to oversee the 
project is working on this right 
now.”

According to Murphy, the primary purpose of 
reshman Orientation is social in nature and its 
¡condary objective is to provide some educational 
rograms. Murphy believes that this objective could 
met either with or without a camp.
‘I hope they don’t get rid of camp,” said Jaitin. 
joing to camp only helps those students who 
ttend without hurting anybody, while not having 
camp wouldn’t help anybody.”
Some other issues which the committee has looked 
into, but about which no final decision has been 
made, include: which programs belong in orienta­
tion; whether or not to have the health education in 
the same format as previous years; whether coun­
sellors should be paid; when and where Freshman 
Camp will take place, if at all; should RAs be more 
involved with orientation; and should counselors go 
through training.
Thursday, Walter plans to visit a potential site 
near Uniontown for next year’s Freshman Camp.

Future looks uncertain for Beaux Arts

students. “Everybody in the administra­
tion is scared thatif anything goes wrong 
the school is going to get the axfor it. But 
at the same time, how can they help us 
plan and promote this Ball and not be 
responsible for it? It’s a cop-out; they 
have no faith or trust in us at all.”
Student Senate, in a strongly worded 
resolution introduced by CFA represen­
tative Ingrid Bromberg, agreed with 
Lambert and demanded that the Ball be 
held in CFA. “Not only is the cancella­
tion of the Beaux Arts Ball an example 
of the continuing trend of the admini­
stration’s neglect of the concerns of the 
students in the College of Fine Arts; we 
view it as an insult toward the character 
and sensibilities of the students in the 
College of Fine Arts.”
Senate’s resolution passed nearly 
unanimously.
However, moving the Ball off campus 
is the only compromise the University is 
willing to make which allows drinking. 
“The off-campus establishments have 
liquor licenses and are prepared to 
uphold the state’s liquor laws. Alcohol is 
thè main issue,” said Walter.
While allowing those over 21 to drink, 
an off-campus location is by no means a 
cure-all solution. “We’velost alot;there’s 
no way you can say that the Ball will 
ever be as good,” said fifth-year archi­
tect Norm Larson, who organized a
Warner-Hall protest by 60 CFA stu­
dents two weeks ago.
“When you move it off campus, the 
Ball loses a lot of its charm and history,” 
said Larson.
“The whole decision [to move the Ball 
off campus] was just like slapping us in 
the face. It’s our Ball and we’re the ones 
that do all the work for it and the ad­
ministration didn’t consult us at all 
before their decision,” said Lambert.
To curb the drunk driving possible 
with an off-campus event, the Univer­
sity will probably provide bus transpor­
tation to and from the night-long event, 
said Student Ombudsman Michael 
Murphy.
In addition to settling the Ball’s loca­
tion, the Beaux Arts Ball Committee is 
fighting for funds. According to Lam­
bert, the 1,200-person ball could cost up 
to $50,000. That money will be recov­
ered through admission fees ($30 for 
students and $35 for faculty, staff, and 
alumni), but the committee needs it in 
advance to organize the event.
In the past, Student Affairs has set up 
a Beaux Arts Ball account based on the 
number of tickets the Committee ex­
pected to sell, said Associate Dean of 
Student Affairs Lois Cox. This year, 
because Lambert never gave her a 
budget, the Beaux Arts Ball Committee 
hasn’t been funded.
“I’m not the one that instigates the
budget. It’s up to the Beaux Arts Ball 
Committee to come up with a budget,” 
said Cox.
As a result, Lambert, who was never 
told to submit abudget, has asked Presi­
dent Cyert for money so he can reserve 
a club and hire entertainment.
“Student Affairs was not forthcoming 
with any kind of help with money or the 
alcohol issue. They just sat around and 
said, "We’!! get back to you.’ And then 
they told us to go to Student Senate and 
ask them for the money for the Ball — 
it’s a private party and we can’t even 
take public funds,” said Lambert.
Walter denies telling Lambert to go to 
Senate for funds.
Lambert is also worried about the 
timing of Student Affairs’ decision, 
coming one month before the Ball was 
scheduled to occur.
“To wait two semesters and a month 
before the Ball to announce that we 
would have to move off campus makes 
you wonder if they were planning this 
the whole time just to needle us along 
and really shaft us,” said Lambert.
Nonetheless, Jill Ruby, a senior de­
sign major and Ball Committee mem­
ber, says she will work to have a ball 
whatever the administration decides.
“It’s better to have it somewhere else 
than not to have it at all.”

By RUSS SELIGMAN
Tartan Business Manager
The offices of Student Af­
fairs and Legal Affairs have 
joined forces in an effort to 
provide students with free 
legal advice.
The program will be run by 
Assistant Dean of Student 
Affairs Ron Campana and 
Vice President for Develop­
ment Alvin Brannick.
According to Campana, the
goal of the program is “to offer 
preliminary advice. It’s not to 
represent anyone or go to court 
for anyone. It’stopointpeople 
in the right direction, where 
they should go, what they 
should be doing.”
Brannick added, “We’re not 
in a position of providing legal 
counsel. If [students] think 
they have a legal problem, we 
can define it for them. If we 
can give them some practical 
legal help that will solve a
problem quickly, we’ll do that. 
But if they actually need rep­
resentation, then there are 
several things that we can 
suggest to them.”
Campana and Brannick will 
alternate holding one office 
hour each week on alternate 
Mondays and Thursdays. 
Students in need of advice 
should make appointments in 
advance.
Thefollowingdays areavail- 
able for appointments from
3:30-4:30 in the afternoon. 
Brannick: March 6, 16, April

Tough Pennsylvania liquor law 
designed to curb underage drinking
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
Despite the fact that Pennsylvania’s 
toughened underage drinking law has 
been in effect for nearly a year, many 
people are still unclear as to how it will 
affect life at Carnegie Mellon.
The law mandates severe penalties 
for both minors who are caught drink­
ing and the people who provided the 
alcohol to them.
Under the law, minors who attempt 
to misrepresent themselves as being 
21 or older are guilty of a summary 
offense (similar to a traffic ticket) the 
first time they are caught and are 
subject to fines. Repeat offenders may 
be charged with a third degree misde­
meanor which carries a maximum 
penalty of a $500 fine. Related viola­
tions such as drinking underage and 
helping a minor misrepresent his or 
her age carry similar penalties.
Many provisions of the law also 
provide for driver’s licence suspen­
sions as punishment, even if the viola­
tion did not involve driving under the 
influence of alcohol.
The part of the law which has caused 
the most concern at CMU relates to 
the penalties for providing alcohol to 
minors. The law states in part that “a 
person commits a misdemeanor of the 
third degree if he intentionally and 
knowingly sells or intentionally and 
knowingly furnishes, or purchases 
with the intent to furnish, any [alco­
holic beverage] to a person who is less 
than 21 years of age.”
This section of the law is considered 
especially dangerous for people in­
volved in underage drinking because 
it is so loosely defined. In particular, 
the word “furnish” has concerned many 
people because it potentially could be 
interpreted to include nearly anyone 
related to the organization of an event 
where a minor is served alcohol.
University Attorney Alvin Brannick 
speculates that “There is some reason 
to believe that if we [the University] 
allow functions to happen on campus 
where students under the age of 21 
would be consuming alcohol... we could 
be held to be a furnisher of it.”
Under the most vigorous enforce­
ment of the law, each minor found 
drinking at a party could be defined as 
a separate offense for the party’s or­
ganizers. This raises the possibility of 
fines in excess of several hundred 
thousand dollars in situations similar 
to the November 1987 raid on two 
CMU fraternities in which nearly 150 
students were arrested.
Another issue is how the new law 
affects liability for injuries or deaths 
resulting from underage drinking. 
Brannick said that “There are situ­
ations, quite possibly, where we [the 
University] could be presumed to be in 
control simply because the law says 
we are.”
In response to the law, CMU adopted 
a new alcohol policy last summer.
The section of the policy which may 
prove to have the most impact on the 
serving of alcohol at organized stu­
dent events states that “Permission to 
serve alcoholic beverages where stu­
dents will be in attendance can only be 
obtained through the Dean of Student 
Affairs [Brad Walter].” It also requires 
that a person on the exempt payroll 
(faculty members and administrators) 
take personal responsibility for insur­
ing that minors are not served.
Brannick pointed out that the per­
son would not actually have to insure 
this, but merely try to do so “to the best 
of [his or her] ability.” However, the 
provision creates a large personal lia­
bility for the person who accepts re­
sponsibility for an event and may dis­
courage many administrators and 
faculty members from agreeing to 
supervise such events.

the dorm would be ready by Au­
gust. “I’m glad they’re waiting. It 
would have been bad if they had 
signed people up for rooms that 
won’t be ready in time,” com­
mented sophomore Meg Veily.
To fill the dorm when it is fin­
ished, Housing may try “some­
thing like a mini-room draw for 
students who wish to make room 
changes,” said Martin. The dorm 
should be ready for occupancy by 
the spring semester of 1990.
At present, Martin envisions 
the mini-room draw to work like 
the regular selection. Seniority 
and random numbers would de­
termine who could move into the 
dorm. Only students in Univer­
sity Housing would be allowed to 
make the room change.
Presumably, the room changes 
would open 302 spots in the rest 
of Housing. Martin is unsure of 
the effect this room shuffling 
would have on the housing sys­
tem.
Construction of the dorm was 
announced in early 1987. It was 
presented then as a solution to 
problems with University-owned 
off-campus housing. Neighbors of 
some off-campus buildings had 
complained to the University 
about the presence of students.
At that time the University, 
through Vice President for Busi­
ness Affairs Frederick Rogers, 
negotiated to remove much off- 
campus housing by 1990, when 
the new dorm was scheduled to be 
completed.
With the dorm construction 
delayed, Martin intends to retain 
essentially all of the University’s 
off-campus housing. He believes 
that the University will be able to 
amend its agreement with the 
neighbors.
In fact, he claims that the atti­
tude of the neighbors toward the 
off-campus housing has changed. 
Rather than calling for the re­
moval of the University, he says 
some neighbors are circulating a 
petition calling for the University 
to continue managing the apart­
ments.
The dorm was originally 
planned to be built along Marga­
ret Morrison Street. When the 
East Campus Project was adopted 
as part of the University’s master 
plan, the dorm’s position moved 
to more efficiently use the avail­
able space.
The East Campus Project is part 
of a long-range plan to build a 
new University Center. The east 
campus construction must pre­
cede the Center. The dormitory 
will house a 400-seat dining facil­
ity, which will replace those lost 
while the Center is constructed 
on the site of Skibo.
The dining facility in the dorm 
will not be completed until May 
1990 at the earliest, and probably 
will not be in operation until the 
fall of 1990.

: Council of Fraternity Presidents, 
iPanhel, SDC, Spirit, Student 
Senate, and The Tartan. In addi- 
I tion, Robitshek chose Rao to chair 
the committee.
On January 24, Senate passed 
a resolution introduced by H&SS 
' Senator Matt Ruben which would 
have replaced Robitshek’s com­
mittee with another picked by 
Senate. Robitshek vetoed the 
Senate resolution.
On January 29, Senate Chair 
Glenn Kornbrek called an emer­
gency meeting. In a little under 
three hours, Senate and Ro­
bitshek roughed out terms of a 
compromise committee which 
included a representative from 
Student Senate but otherwise was 
identical to the final committee.
Two weeks ago, GSIA Senator 
Stew Levine introduced a resolu­
tion outlining the terms of the 
compromise worked out on Janu­
ary 29. After a Levine-sponsored 
amendment to remove the Sen­
ate representative to the commit­
tee was added to the compromise 
resolution, it passed Senate. True
to his word, Robitshek did not 
veto it.
Under the terms of the final 
resolution, Senate nominated four 
students from each undergradu­
ate college and the Industrial 
Management Department; from 
the Senate nominations, Ro­
bitshek selected one student in 
•each category. Five organizations
— GALA, Spirit, SDC, CFP, and 
Panhel — were each asked to 
select one representative for the 
committee.
Finally, four graduate students 
were selected last week by the 
Graduate Student Organization, 
bringing the total to fourteen.
The committee will select a chair 
from within its own ranks.
The student search committee 
is a subcommittee of a faculty 
search committee chaired by John 
Fetkovich, the current chair of 
the Faculty Senate. Both the fac­
ulty search committee and a trus­
tee search committee chaired by 
Robert A. Charpie will funnel a 
“short list” of candidates to the 
Presidential Search Steering 
Committee, chaired by Board of
Trustees Chair Douglas D. Dan- 
forth.
One student, selected by 
Fetkovich and confirmed by the 
Board of Trustees, will sit on the 
steering committee. According to 
Robitshek, Fetkovich has already 
chosen Rao as the student repre­
sentative from a list of candidates 
drawn up by Robitshek.
“I was looking for people who I 
thought had a good idea what 
their jobs were, people who would 
represent all students from their 
school, not just from their depart­
ment,” Robitshek said. “I spent a 
deal of time going through Sen­
ate’s list and asking questions.”
Robitshek wants to reserve 
judgement about the new com­
mittee. “I’ll let you know whether 
I’m satisfied after the meeting 
Thursday,” he said.
Ruben, who introduced the 
original resolution condemning 
Robitshek’s first committee, is 
also reserving judgement. “Hope­
fully they’ll do a good job,” he 
said. “Considering all the inter­
ests that had to be served, I think 
it turned out pretty well.”

explained, “the government 
ropped funding, because the

all also stated that Eirene 
¡d not contact him regarding SDI 
^tracts, and stated, “I don’t 
link it’s a good idea for people to 
lflke such claims unless they 
¡rify them beforehand.” 
Casasent was out of town all
weekend and was unable to be 
reached for comment. Jensen’s 
number was not listed by Eirene, 
and does not appear in the Fac­
ulty/Staff Directory.
Jordan told The Tartan, “All 
these research contracts, except 
for Casasent’s, are not directly 
funded by SDI. They are funded 
by D ARPA [the Defense Advanced 
Projects Research Agency], which 
in turn obtains money, in certain 
cases, from SDI.”
Eirene criticized Jordan for 
providing information that he 
called “unreadable,” implying that 
the information was composed of 
military/technical jargon inacces­
sible to non-technical people. 
“Provost Jordan has done a very 
good job of disinformation,” stated
Eirene. “We have been given dis­
information by Provost Jordan 
which has added to the moral 
vacuum at Carnegie Mellon.” 
While speaking about Jordan, 
Eirene employed the words “lies” 
and “lied” many times during the 
press conference, although he 
never directly called Jordan a liar. 
After the press conference, how­
ever, Eirene told The Tartan that 
“Jordan’s disinformation is tan­
tamount to lying.”
Jordan responded by saying, 
“The list is not disinformation. 
These are the titles of the con­
tracts which are related to SDI. 
These are the names of the people. 
Where is the disinformation?” 
Jordan continued, “If he doesn’t 
know what ‘systolic’ means, that’s 
his problem.”
During the press con­
ference, Eirene called for 
three actions on the part 
of the University. First, 
Eirene asked that a “pub­
lic forum” be held by the 
professors involved in 
military research, where 
they could publicly ex­
plain to the University 
community exactly what 
kind of research in which 
they are involved.
Second, Eirene called for 
an annual report to be 
published by the Univer­
sity describing all military 
contracts in non-technical
“We believe that Carnegie Mellon Uni­
versity should be a place of truth and 
beauty, and not of lies and destruc­

who are working on ... SDI to stop.”

Jordan replied, “A public forum 
because he wants a public forum? 
Who is he? Is he a student? Is he 
a member of the faculty? I cannot 
comply with his wishes, because 
he is not a member of Carnegie 
Mellon.” Jordan further explained 
that such proposals might be 
carried out if made by “a repre­
sentative majority” of students or 
faculty, but “not in response to 
[Eirene’s] threats or demands.” 
University Professor Lincoln 
Wolfenstein spoke with The Tar­
tan before the press conference. 
Referring to Eirene’s involvement 
with SEI, Wolfenstein remarked, 
“I thought it was worthwhile to 
find out what specific work was 
going on at the Software Engi­
neering Institute. Quite remarka­
bly, no one knew, and no one on 
campus, including me, apparently 
had the energy to go over and find 
out. It wasn’t secret, but it was 
quite different from the impres­
sion Provost Jordan was giving 
us. It was a useful service.”
Wolfenstein added, “At the time 
SEI was formed, I thought it was 
not a good idea. I think the Uni­
versity is overly dependent on the 
Department of Defense.”
Student response to Eirene’s 
press conference was mixed. A 
student who said that she works 
at SEI, but asked not to be identi­
fied, said, “I think professors have 
every right to do exactly what 
they want to do.”
Ethan Evans, a sophomore ECE 
major, remarked, “If a professor 
wants to do defense-related re­
search, that’s fine. I can’t believe 
that people find the program of­
fensive.”
Sophomore Susan Olson admit­
ted, “My dad works for a defense 
contractor,” but said, “I don’t have 
an opinion one way or another.” 
Dave Koetke, a freshman archi­
tect who attended the press con­
ference, said, “If the SEI isn’t at 
this school, it’s going to be some­
where else.”
Freshman Eric Ewanco, who 
also heard Eirene speak, said, “If 
SEI is trying to hide something 
that they shouldn’t be hiding, then 
they shouldn’t hide it.”
Junior English major Rebecca
Lane, also in attendance, re­
marked, “I agree with him. I re-, 
ally don’t know what’s going on 
here and I’m really curious to find; 
out. I don’t really think that our 
tuition should go to SEI. I don’t 
think it’s fair, because I think the 
majority of students don’t stand 
behind it. At least I don’t stand 
behind it.”
Eirene and his associate, Kevin 
Forsythe, plan to hold “an un­
sanctioned dance” tonight in Grey 
Matter.
Eirene and Forsythe are affili­
ated with Duncan and Porter 
House, an organization that of­
fers shelter and support to the 
homeless on the North Side. A 
warrant for their arrest was put 
out Friday for their refusal to pay 
the fines they received in Decem­
ber for chaining themselves to 
the doors of the SEI building. 
Forsythe and Eirene have been in 
hiding since Friday and plan to 
face re-arrest tonight at the dance.
Forsythe, an attorney and for­
mer advisor to democratic may- 
oral candidate Tom Flaherty, said, 
“We think that people involved in 
research for the military on a 
campus devoted to the pursuit of 
truth and and the appreciation of 
beauty is wrong. Not only are we 
calling on the professors to stop 
the research, but we’re calling on 
everyone here to examine their 
own lives, and stop the things 
that they’re doing to support this 
madness. Today, hopefully, some 
people came and heard some 
things that maybe they hadn’t 
heard before, and hopefully some 
people’s hearts were changed.”

an insult toward the character

Put the Ball back
According to campus tradition, 
the Beaux Arts Ball is an all-night, 
once-every-four-years celebration 
held in the College of Fine Arts 
building for CFA students and 
their guests. Like an unbroken 
Fence and Tech Field, it’s a tradi­
tion no longer.
In a memo written on January 
30, Dean of Student Affairs Brad 
Walter declared “the University 
is willing to consider alternatives 
to a Beaux Arts Ball.” Although 
Walter never explicitly stated that 
the Ball was cancelled, how else 
do you interpret “alternatives?”
The timing of the memo was 
lousy. Beaux Arts ChairTroy Lam­
bert tried to have a meeting with 
administrators in early Novem­
ber; after putting him off for three 
weeks, Walter finally consented 
to see him on November 21.
Two months later — a period in 
which no significant developments 
took place to make the prospect of 
aball infeasible—Walterwrote a 
memo which quashed all hopes of 
a traditional Beaux Arts Ball.
Lambert didn’t find this out until 
three days later, on the evening of 
February 2. That was just over 
one month before the Ball was to 
have taken place, on March 11 — 
hardly advance notice.
But Student Affairs has bungled 
more than just the timing of the 
Ball. Traditionally, Beaux Arts
organizers have prepared a budget 
showing estimated income from 
ticket sales; Student Affairs then 
advanced the Ball Committee the 
money it needed.
But this year, Lambert’s com­
mittee was never informed that it 
should come up with a tentative 
budget. Instead of sitting down 
and saying, “Here’s what you need 
to do,” Student Affairs has pretty 
much said, “Figure all the an­
swers out on your own; well tell 
you when you get them right.”
The final — and biggest—blun­
der by the administration is a fal­
lacy in logic. Sure, there were 
problems with alcohol, drugs, and 
property damage at the 1985 B all.
But with the exception of a very 
few people, current CFA students 
weren’t around in 1985. The ad­
ministration is telling CFA stu­
dents that because their prede­
cessors were irresponsible, they 
can’t be trusted. That’s insulting.
Everyone understands that 
there are problems with an event 
such as the Beaux Arts Ball, espe­
cially given Pa.’s new liquor laws.
But it’s time to work together 
and enhance some of that “Qual­
ity of Life” we keep hearing about. 
There’s no reason that CFA stu­
dents and administrators can’t get 
with it and “have a Ball” on March 
11 — and have it in the CFA 
building where it belongs.

Working for a cleaner, gentler CMU
Editor:
Regarding the proposal to give a 37% 
kickback of Greek activities fees to the 
Council of Fraternity Presidents: I’d like 
to express my hearty support. But I don’t 
think the kickbacks should stop there; 
plenty of students here at CMU are get­
ting ripped off.
Take us anti-social types. We seldom 
leave the house for campus-oriented rec­
reation; we’d rather oversleep than join 
Crew, overstudy than catch a movie, 
overeat than attend a dance. According 
to my estimates, we’re eligible for a 43.8% 
refund of our activities fees. But wait, 
what about people who live off campus? 
They seldom make it over for extra-cur­
ricula, especially in the winter months. 
After a few rounds with my calculator, 
I’ve estimated their comeuppance as
'o88o1V 8i 8no 6,58i1
39.6% of the $40.00. Finally, people who 
take over 54 units a semester seldom 
have time for fun. They deserve a 29% 
refund — as do those who work 15 hours 
or more per week. As a member of sev­
eral of the above groups, I figure the 
activities board would actually owe me 
150.4% of my activities fee per semester 
—after afour-year stay at Carnegie Mel­
lon, I’d make over 160 bucks in extra 
kickbacks. This could mean the micro­
wave I’ve always wanted.
But I realize, of course, that that’s not 
fair to others. That’s why I think every 
student should be issued the Activity 
Fees Appropriation Card. Under this
method, each student would carry a car 
stating her or his contribution to th 
activities fee pot, so that a student wh 
receives no kickbacks could see a cai 
pus movie for the usual one dollai 
whereas I, having received a 50.4i 
payoff, would have to pay $1.50. As fd 
that extra .4%, don’t worry; every time 
see a movie, the ticket-seller will puncl 
a hole in my AFAC card, until the frac 
tions add up to a coinable amount. Tha 
is, after five visits to the movies, my .4' 
notches will add up to 2.0%; I will pay a 
extra two cents that day. It sounds 
little confusing, but believe me, it’s th 
best way. I mean, the world’s suppose 
to be fair, isn’t it?

Each of us at CMU is respon­
sible for producing 1300 pounds of 
trash each year. This has to stop; 
we simply don’t have the room. By 
recycling and reducing what we 
throw away, we can reduce the 
burden on the environment.
Many cities have to haul their 
trash miles away. In the 1990s, 
they will have to haul it even fur­
ther. The EPA has estimated that 
one-third of the nation’s dumps 
will be full in the next five years.
Recycling is a major answer to 
the waste problem, one which is 
simple for students to do. Already 
several organizations, like SUPA 
and CMURecon, collect cans and 
bottles. Computer clusters and the 
libraries have boxes for paper.
Soon there will be no excuse for 
not recycling on this campus. 
Student Ombudsman Michael 
Murphy and Senator Mark Mit- 
telhauser are working on a cam­
pus-wide recycling plan. Organi­
zations like the Student Dormi­
tory Council and Alpha Phi Omega 
have expressed interest in collect­
ing recyclables. Receptacles for 
different types of recyclable waste 
will be placed around campus.
Also, we have to be more con­
scious of what types of materials 
we use. For instance, the Tartan 
Grill and Scotland Yard serve food 
on styrcfoam. Chlorofluorocar- 
bons, which are produced in the 
manufacturing of styrofoam, have 
been proven to deplete the ozone 
layer, which protects crops and 
people from ultraviolet rays. Bio­
degradable paper plates would 
serve the same pupose at the same 
cost. Simply, we need ozone more 
than we need styrofoam.
Recyclingis no longer something 
we should do; it is something we 
must do. Unless we become more 
aware of our wasteful habits, pol­
lution will overwhelm us. The 
earlier we start separating our 
trash, the sooner we’ll become a 
cleaner, gentler nation.

Editor:
The purpose of this letter to the editor 
is to clarify the ambiguities published in 
the letter written by Steve Peters which 
appeared in the last issue of The Tartan, 
[“After his own conflict with ATO broth­
ers, student claims apology came ‘far too 
soon’,” 2/7].
First, I’d like to point out an error in 
Mr. Peters’ argument that there were 
“several” ATO brothers. The group he is 
referring to included myself and one other 
ATO brother; next to him was a young 
lady. As we sat down and the stats TA 
handed back our tests, my sole fraternity 
brother and I, along with the young lady, 
were counting over the problems we had 
incorrectly answered. Mr. Peters states 
that “the group was talking loudly.” 
Admittedly, our discussion was slightly 
louder than a true whisper, yet, Mr. 
Peters felt self-righteous enough to be 
certain “ ... this was disturbing other 
people around them as well,” although 
not a single person, including the TA, 
mentioned anything about a disturbance.
Unintendedly, the discussion extended 
beyond the TA’s explanation of the first 
problem which I failed to answer cor­
rectly. Consequently, realizing my fault, 
I did not want to interrupt the TA, since 
she had already proceeded to explain the 
solution to the next question, which I 
had answered correctly. Thus I decided 
to ask my brother to elucidate the solu­
tion. It was at this point when Mr. Peters 
abruptly turned around and uncouthly 
bellowed, “I’M TRYING TO LISTEN TO 
THE RECITATION.” His tone seemed 
intentional to capture the attention of
our classmates and TA. As a result, my 
self-defense mechanism was alarmed and 
I responded with inappropriate foul 
language. I realize the curses were crude 
on my part, for which I apologize, “yet let 
he who is without sin cast the first stone.” 
Albeit, in my response to Kevin Barney, 
I wrote one should KINDLY - instead of 
barbarically - ask to keep it down. Thus, 
there is a lesson to be learned, Mr. Pe­
ters, rudeness will be met with rudeness. 
Fortunately, my grandmother taught me 
not to physically retaliate against any­
one that possesses an unmanly frame 
that is as innocuous as a fly.
I would think a well-adapted person 
first attempts to resolve his misunder­
standings with a second party through 
direct and open communication prior to 
presenting the case to'the attention of a 
third party. Mr. Peters failed to commu­
nicate with me after the recitation. Mr. 
Peters is an ill-adapted member of soci­
ety, evident by his dearth of sensibility. 
Mr. Peters, being a Creative Writing 
major, side-stepped this approach and 
created a masterfully subjective letter to 
The Tartan.
I must say that Mr. Peters’ behavior is 
most amusing, for it is analogous to a 
young child’s; after a disagreement with 
the kid on the corner, he hastily runs to 
his parents for support “because so and 
so is bothering me.” Well, I don’t know 
about Mr. Peters but I’m a 19-year-old 
college student and I don’t have time to 
play patty-cake.
Coming to terms with Mr. Peters’ child­
ish attitude, I do not expect an apology 
from Mr. Peters. Also, realizing children
always have to get the last word in, I d 
not intend to reply to any future letter 
to The Tartan authored by Mr. Peter 
expressing any sort of bias criticism, 
have more imperative and mature mat 
ters to occupy my time. I don’t know wh 
you think you are, Steve Peters, but Th 
Tartan staff doesn’t have to put up wit 
this whining.

this university.
The information that the administra

Editor:
I would like to address the letter Steve 
Peters submitted to The Tartan [“After 
his own conflict with ATO ...2/7].
To refresh your memory, Mr. Peters 
wrote a letter describing an incident he 
had with “several” ATO brothers during 
a recent statistics recitation. He stated 
that he asked the ATOs to Mquiet down” 
and was cursed at in retaliation. He 
went on to say that Mr. Peter Pa­
pagianakis, one of the brothers, swore at 
Mr. Peters and exhibited behavior unbe­
coming for this university.
Well Mr. Peters, I can see you are 
excellent in your won Creative Writing 
major because that piece of fiction you 
wrote was incredible ... that is to say 
incredibly twisted! I was sitting beside 
you during that recitation, and I know 
what really happened. I will agree that 
Mr. Papagianakis and his fellow brother
Bill Snyder (:i:please not that they were 
the only two brothers there,... you incor­
rectly stated in your letter that there 
were “several ATO brothers”) were chat­
ting during the class. I distinctly remem­
ber that they were discussing a problem 
from the test we had just gotten back, 
and perhaps were minutely noisier than 
necessary. Being that I was sitting di­
rectly in front of them and had no trouble 
concentrating on what the teacher was 
saying, I can attest that they were not 
disrupting the whole class. I highly doubt 
that people on the other side of the room 
could even hear them. What did disrupt 
the entire class was your outrageous 
outburst. You rudely yelled at them to 
shut up. Your action was inconsiderate 
to the class as well as to Mr. Papagianakis 
and Mr. Snyder. In addition, you claimed 
that Mr. Papagianakis retaliated with 
“you Peking a**hole, you could have
been more polite about it, f*cking jerk. 
Mr. Peters, I must say you have a vivu 
imagination! The actual phrase used vva 
“you stupidjerk.” I remember this clear! 
because I had thought, if your outburs 
had been directed at me, I would hav 
called you much worse.
My interest in all of this is to purely se 
the record straight. You mistakenly mad 
a point of turning this incident into 
public affair, trying to make it sound a 
if some polite, shy, and studious guy wa 
getting harassed by a group of nast) 
apathetic and rude ATO brothers. 
fortunately for you, I was there and kno' 
that your letter was completely larg 
mammal excretion. Do us all a favor an 
save your creative writing for your cla-5 
assignments.

Just as the recent movie Twins 
)0rtrayed Danny DeVito as an 
gnored side-effect of a genetic ex- 
,eriment, the Information Age 
,as an ignored child — high-tech 
lornography. CMU, a leader in 
nformation technology, was des- 
ined to become a leader in devel- 
,ping the New Pornography.
It’s already apparent that our 
hildren will have trouble imag­
ing a society where porno was 
ivailable only at isolated country 
jrive-ins and in the big city’s seedy 
novie houses. The video revolu- 
ion moved porn into the home, 
irst with soft-porn for those who 
ould subscribe to cable, and then 
vith the explosion of VCR sales 
lationwide. (Porn comprises 
ibout 15 percent of all video tape 
entals.)
Carnegie Mellon’s computer 
echnology gives us a glimpse of 
vhat is to come: scanned raster 
mages of nudes are posted on an 
Andrew bulletin board, obscene 
okes are sent electronically 
^hrough Arpanet, and the Macin- 
osh interactive game (complete 
vith sound) MacPlaymate now 
tllows the consumer of porn to do 
¡omething more than just watch. 
Meanwhile, the low-tech pom 
narket, which includes X-rated 
heaters and Playboy magazine, 
s declining as the New Porn 
levelops. And the New Porn has 
ivolved rapidly since my fresh- 
nan-year roommate dialed a 976 
lumber and had me listen.
It’s foolish to speculate where it 
will spread. Camcorders already 
allow homemade porno. Hologra­
phy? Robotics? Personalized, 
high-res, color computer pom?
Meanwhile sociologists will 
have a field day studying the ef­
fect of technology on gender. The 
VCR led to the “feminization” of 
pom, with 40 percent of tapes 
being rented by women. But 
computer and information tech­
nology, especially at CMU, is 
dominated by men, so it’s no coin­
cidence that the subjects of high- 
tech pom have predominantly 
been women.
Another aspect of the new tech­
nology will affect how our society 
discusses pornography. Speaking 
here last year, writer Tom Wolfe 
called pornography the vice of the 
1970s, a time when our judicial 
system struggled to define pom’s 
role in the First Amendment right 
of free speech. The debates, such 
as whether Entropy should be al­
lowed to sell Penthouse, brought 
pornography out into open dis­
cussion.
Technology has made the legal 
and moral arguments of the last 
decade obsolete. But by taking 
pornography out of the public eye, 
it has removed pom from public 
discussion. Being more frank 
about the existence of pornogra­
phy would be healthy for our soci­

At last, the truth behind the 
Beaux Arts cancellation
/Ió3515IP 25I,V 
e8o4 'of5Io
The latest campus controversy 
is the decision by Student Affairs 
to cancel the Beaux Arts Ball. I 
hope that it gets reinstated; I 
really want to see what $50,000 of 
damage to CFA looks like.
Less than two months before 
the event, Dean Walter informed 
the students of the College of Fine 
Arts about his decision, and 
prompted the best campus pro­
test since the tuition protest of 
1983. This time Warner Hall 
didn’t provide cookies for the 
protesters to throw at the Flash- 
cube. Luckily though, the students 
brought their own marshmallows 
for the same purpose.
The thing is, no one really 
understands why the Ball was 
cancelled. Was it fear of alcohol; 
vandalism; an outbreak of fun?
Frankly, I too, am baffled. All 
I’ve heard about Beaux-Arts 
places it just shades to the right of 
some of the better scenes from the 
Arabian Nights. Not that I be­
lieved that anything like that 
could happen at Carnegie Mel­
lon, but I’d like to think that 
almost anything is possible.
Eventually, I ran out of ideas 
for the cancellation ... and for my 
column. So, I decided to call my 
friend Dave, and he’s provided 
this explanation for the cancella­
tion....
And now, tonight’s top 10 list, 
from the home office at Panther 
Hollow Inn. The Top Ten reasons 
why the Beaux Arts Ball was 
cancelled:
10. Dean Walter knew that only 
CFA students get tickets and that 
he probably wouldn’t be invited. 
9. Putting up decorations would 
interfere with Carnegie Mellon’s 
plans to put up new wallpaper in 
CFA.
8. Theme “Extremes” conflicted 
with goal of a kinder, gentler 
university.
7. Money was needed to put up 
two more GSIA trailers.
6. Carnegie Mellon unable to rent 
all PAT buses for the night.
5. Couldn’t get any research grant 
money from IBM for it.
4. Keeps tradition of cancelling at 
least one scheduled ball or ban­
quet per year.
3. The Tartan needed a new lead 
story after the Senate furor died 
down.
2. Ball scheduled during Univer­
sity free time.
And the number one reason why 
the Beaux Arts Ball was can­
celed....
1. Wanted to wait until new stu­
dent union is completed and hold 
it there.

piece of advice to any other 
public figures who may be con­
sidering having affairs. If you’ve 
got to do it, guys, at least prac­
tice safe sex — take her to a 
hotel where you won’t be recog­
nized.
• Only 49 days until the Chi­
cago Cubs’ opening game. I may 
make it through another win­
ter, yet.
•Before you come down too 
hard on Kitty Dukakis for her 
drinking problem consider how 
you would feel if you (or your 
girlfriend, mother, etc.) had lost 
out to Barbara Bush for the job 
of first lady. You might be hit­
ting the bottle a bit, too.
•All CFA students are invited 
to come over to Brad Walter’s 
house on March 11 for milk and 
cookies. If you don’t have a ride 
call the LCB. I hear they have 
some PAT buses they won’t be 
using that night.
•Edye Tarbox drives a 
Porsche. I think I’m in love.
•Modem technology is great. 
There is now a Mac machine on 
the corner of Forbes and Mur­
ray in Squirrel Hill that will 
sell you postage stamps and 
charge them to your bank ac­
count. I can hardly wait to see 
what they come up with next. 
Maybe an automatic teller 
machine that will write home 
for you and charge it to your 
parents’ account.
•And finally, last but cer­
tainly not least: Happy Valen­
tine’s Day, Mom. (This one is no 
joke. Even goon/crutches — as 
the Student Union affection­
ately referred to me in their 
recent plumbing catalog—have 
mothers.)

tributing editor.
Case 1: Student writes paper 
on Margaret Atwood’s The Hand­
maid’s Tale and receives back a 
B+ with the comments: ‘Very good 
discussion on language and its 
power of repression, with a good 
set of analogies to today’s soci­
ety.... Your weakest parts of the 
essay are your suggestions about 
what to do. You present a too 
passive idea, when direct action/ 
involvement, such as rewriting 
children’» stories, advertise­
ments, TV, etc, is very impor­
tant.”
Case 2: Over the course of the 
semester, a student in CFA has 
received the following grades on 
projects: five As, four Bs, and one 
C-. The student receives a C for a 
semester grade. As far as the 
syllabus goes, no project is given 
greater weighting than another. 
When the student approaches the 
professor and asks why, the pro­
fessor says, “I’m doing you a fa­
vor” and ends the discussion.
Case 3: An architecture stu­
dent who has received Bs and Cs 
for the entire semester is informed 
that there is “something lacking” 
in his/her work and that he/she 
will have to repeat the semester.
In the first case, the grade 
appears to be based entirely on an 
instructor’s opinion, while in the 
other two there was no indication 
throughout the semester that the 
student was doing work equal to 
the grade which he/she received. 
All three cases share the problem 
of overly subjective judgements.
This seems to be a recurrent 
problem at Carnegie Mellon and 
every other university in Amer­
ica. Students have their own 
particular horror stories about 
subjective grades and professors 
who “w[eren’t] going to give [me] 
a good grade no matter what I 
did.”
What can be done about this 
problem? At first glance, not 
much. In several areas, particu­
larly music, art, architecture, 
drama, design, and creative writ­
ing, subjective impressions are 
the standard tool of evaluation. 
“Unfortunately there’s really no 
totally objective way to grade a 
design project,” says one CFA 
student. “What can you do?” says 
another student who didn’t want 
even his department and year 
mentioned. “It would be great if 
there was some way to fight an 
unfair grade, but you can’t — 
particularly in CFA. If you com­
plain about a grade you can forget 
about getting a good grade from
wG giC1Vo 
25rnCoa Em gm E1i38
that professor ever again.”
Is there a solution to this prob­
lem? I believe so. In all cases, the 
largest problem is documentation 
of the grade. If there had been a 
clear matrix delineating how the 
grade was calculated, the students 
in question would have known 
where they stood and what ex­
actly they were doing wrong.
A sample matrix for an English 
paper could be as follows:
Spelling and basic grammarl0% 
Documentation of ideas 20%
Correct textual citations 19%
Agreeing with professor’s politi­
cal prejudices 51%
The same idea of a matrix could 
be applied to an architecture 
project easily, with craftsmanship 
of model, basic design, considera­
tion of environmental and struc­
tural constraints, and presenta­
tion taking the place of the other 
categories. While this is more 
problematic in a design class, 
there could at least be a semester- 
long matrix given so that a stu­
dent would have some idea of how 
much each project counted.
Use of a matrix would also help 
to eliminate the feeling, held by 
many students, that a professor 
will grade based on the student’s 
acceptance of the professor’s own 
political or artistic theories. Of 
course, professors would still be 
able to put in a large “fudge fac­
tor” (called class participation or 
something similar) if they wanted 
to, but it would be more difficult 
to down-grade individual assign­
ments based on prejudice.
I expect that two different forms 
of argument against the preced­
ing suggestions will be given by 
professors. The first will be that 
there is no way to totally objec­
tively judge whether or not a piece 
of work in a highly subjective area 
like art or literature is of a spe­
cific quality. Possibly, but the 
current system does not fulfill its 
purpose, which is supposedly to 
provide feedback so that the stu­
dent can work on the specific areas 
that need development. With the 
grade on a piece of work being 
reduced to one letter and a sen­
tence or two of comments, the 
student does not know exactly 
what is good and what is bad. The

Twenty second sound bites 
seem to have become very popu­
lar lately. Hardly a day went by 
last fall that George Bush and 
Michael Dukakis did not try to 
analyze some complex issue 
vital to the survival of Western 
democracy in 25 words or less.
I figure you don’t have to be 
some big shot politician to in- 
I suit the intelligence of the 
’ American public. Therefore, I 
would like to present my writ­
ten version of some 20 second
sound bites on recent news• ..items.
•The judge presiding over Ol­
iver North’s trial has been 
having a hard time finding 
potential jurors who have not 
yet formed an opinion about the 
case. For once I actually feel 
sorry for North. How would you 
like to know that your future 
, was going to be in the hands of 
the only 12 people in the coun­
try so out of touch that they 
, have not heard about the Iran- 
, Contra Affair?
•I’m rooting for the fraterni­
ties and sororities to get some of 
their money back from Student 
Senate. I figure if they can get a 
37 percent kickback of their ac­
tivities fee because they claim 
they do not participate in cam­
pus organizations, I should be 
able to get some of my tuition 
back every time I cut class.
•I’ve decided I want to be a 
congressman when I grow up.
: How can you not love a job where 
1 your biggest problem is figur- 
I ing out how to avoid having to 
' take a 51 percent pay raise?
•First we had Gary Hart. 
Then it as Jim Bakker and
• Jimmy Swaggart. Now John 
'Tower has become the latest 
public figure to endanger his
use of an objective matrix would 
help solve this problem.
The next argument will be that 
in the “real world” there are no 
matrices given, a proposal or piece 
of work is either accepted or re­
jected. Since college is training 
for the “real world,” it should be 
run the same way. This flawed 
argument is used to defend al­
most any practices that students 
find unfair. The “real world” 
clause has popped up in almost 
every course I have had for the 
past three years.
However, a university is not 
the “real world” and attempts to 
make it operate in the same way 
are doomed to failure. The pur­
pose of a university is to teach. 
That is why we are all spending 
what we spend to come here. If we 
wanted simply a trial period in 
the “real world” we could go out 
and be paid to make this trial. 
And it would be more effective 
than a simulated “real world”
experience. Further discussion of 
the “real world” fallacy can come 
in a future column.
The amount of feedback given 
by grades is of vital importance to 
learning. If a student does not 
know exactly what is wrong, there 
is little chance of his or her beirfg 
able to correct it. There is also the 
good chance that the student will 
throw out the good with the bad 
in a blind attempt to correct the 
work.
The problems of accurate crite­
ria for grading should be ad­
dressed by the deans of each col­
lege in the University. Grading 
matrices should be as integral a 
part of course and assignment 
planning as syllabi. This will help 
grades to perform their function 
as a learning tool as well as an ac­
creditation device.

Today is Saint Valentine’s 
Day. To those of you with some­
one to share today with, con­
gratulations and good luck. To 
those without, don’t feel too bad
— you’re not alone. Out of the 
last 20 Valentine’s Days, there 
has only been one which I could 
share, and we couldn’t even be 
together.
But enough personal prob­
lems; on with the show.
This month, February, is Af­
rican-American Awareness 
Month. There are events tak­
ing place throughout the rest of 
the month to try and bridge the 
culture gaps that arise from 
having many different back­
grounds. The idea is to be ex­
posed to a culture that many of 
us — of any race — have only 
seen in the movies or television.
This past Saturday at one of 
these events, Dick Gregory 
spoke. He talked about many
hofo1 6I,5IP e8i1u 
ECf5, hm 'ofu
things, but one of the most mem­
orable parts of the lecture was 
when he challenged the SATs.
He turned to one of the white 
audience members in the front 
row and asked him to pretend 
that it was time for the entrance 
exam for college. All the audience 
member would have to do is an­
swer two out of three questions 
and he could go to college. First 
question: what are hamhocks? 
Second question: how do you clean 
chitlins? It was a very quick and 
easy way of showing how differ­
ent two cultures can be.
It’s not always easy to open 
oneself to a new or different expe­
rience. It takes an effort that many 
people would rather not even
attempt. Even easier than going 
to all of these programs is just 
sitting down with someone and 
ask questions. The key to the 
building of any relationship is 
communication: talking and lis­
tening. Everyone is an individual 
with a separate point of view. It 
makes for a great story if we are 
willing to listen.
This month a lot of people are 
working at trying to make break­
ing down the barriers between 
cultures easier. We would all be 
fools not to try and take them up 
on it.
The title for this column came 
from the headline of the first col­
umn, “Senate, the never-ending 
story.” This column was supposed 
to point out the follies of Senate 
and possibly reward the few who 
believed and lived Senate’s slo­
gan of “Working together we 
get things done.”
This semester there has been 
and will be less Senate and more 
life in this column. There’s a 
simple reason: I have a class 
during the Senate meeting 
times.
This doesn’t mean that I don’t 
intend to talk about Senate from 
time to time, but the posturing 
members in Senate may not 
grace this part of the page for a 
while. '
The true never ending story 
is life itself. And every learning 
experience is just another chap­
ter. Our only responsibility is to 
make the story as rich and long 
as possible.

“I am pleased to have such de­
terrent capability in my car, but 
what kind of signal are we send­
ing the Soviet Union when half 
the controls in the back can start 
a war?”
“It was the CIA’s idea. They 
told us that Gorbachev’s limo has 
been equipped with four SS20s in 
the exhaust pipe, and that they 
are aimed directly at the United 
States.”
“Well, all right. How do I re­
ceive the signal to launch my 
nuclear weapons?”
“The point is that what is behind the 
Khomeini’s overtures? Is he suddenly 
becoming a moderate after 87 years 
or [getting ready to] launch a new 
wave of terror and threats.... ”

j Editor:
Since Ollie North went to 
Tehran in a women’s outfit to ex- 
; change arms for hostages, Presi- 
j dent Reagan has been insisting 
| that, although he made a mis- 
| take, the United States should 
j not miss the chance to contact 
j with the “moderates“ in Tehran.
True that Khomeini has given 
: the-green light by agreeing to talk 
to the US government.
But the issue is whether the 
| green light is the result of “mod­
eration” or merely a sophisticated 
public relations maneuver by him 
to restore the torn image of the 
; Islamic Republic in the public 
while Khomeini continues to 
conduct terrorism inside and 
| outside of Iran.
Just a few years ago when the 
; Islamic Republic seemed to be 
winning the war against the 
; Iraqis, Khomeini was publically 
advocating terrorism and threat­
ening to export his type of regime 
i to the entire Middle East region.
However, the war turned 
around so much that Khomeini 
agreed in haste to the United 
! Nation’s peace resolution before 
, virtually losing the war. He knew 
that his defeat in the war front, 
would on the one hand, increase 
the discontent of Iranians towards 
his regime and strengthen the op­
position, and on the other hand, 
isolate his already weakened 
regime in the international arena.
Faced with this situation, he 
launched his delicate PR cam­
paign.
Inside Iran, Islamic Republic 
officials started to pretend that 
they had become “moderate” by 
relaxing some of the more notori­
ous Islamic laws and admitting to 
their economic failures. But at 
the same time they began to se­
cretly execute thousands of promi­
nent political prisoners across the 
country in a matter of a few weeks 
without even informing their 
families and relatives. The news 
broke out when a number of mass 
graves were found and some of 
the murdered were identified by 
their families.
Amnesty International said a 
Tehran woman who gave evidence 
had searched secretly for her 
husband’s body. “Groups of bod­
ies ... had been buried in un­
marked shallow graves in the 
section of the cemetery reserved 
for executed leftist political pris­
oners,” Amnesty quoted her as 
saying.
Most victims included tortured 
high school students, teachers, 
and women who belonged to 
people’s Mujahedeen, people’s 
Fedayeen, Tudeh Party, and 
Kurdish opposition groups. The 
extent of this massacre is only 
reminiscent of those seen in Nazi 
death camps and clearly illus­
trates the type of “moderation” 
that Khomeini has in mind.
Outside Iran, Khomeini sud­
denly began to renounce terror­
ism and declared that “his regime 
itself is a victim of terrorism!”
Furthermore, he began to restore 
diplomatic relations with some of 
the western countries and ac­
cepted hundreds of western busi­
nessmen and east block trade 
officials to help rebuild his war 
shattered economy.
However, most importantly of 
all, he began his reconciliatory 
tone toward the former “great 
satan,” the phrase he used to re­
fer to the United States.
The point is what is behind the 
Khomeini’s overtures? Is he sud­
denly becoming a moderate after 
87 years or is he a crying wolf 
trying to strengthen his weak­
ened regime to launch a new wave 
of terror and threats against the 
Iranians and the citizens of other 
countries.
One should not forget that 
Khomeini never humiliated the 
Europeans and the Russians as 
he vilified the Americans. He took 
them hostage in Iran and he is 
still taking them hostage in Leba­
non. He financed the tons of 
explosives that were contained in 
a truck which hit the American 
compound in Beirut and resulted 
in the killing of over 230 Ameri­
can soldiers, and is still financing
the same group, Hezbolah, that 
engineered the attack.
Why is Washington trying to 
obscure the real intentions of 
Khomeini for trying to come out 
of isolation? Why is Washington 
silent about the recent wave of 
mass executions of thousands of 
political prisoners in Iran? Why 
is Washington silent about the 
continued financial and military 
support of Khomeini’s regime for 
for the terrorist organizations 
across the world?
Khomeini might have thought 
that he would be praised for his 
economic pragmatism in opening 
the doors to the western compa­
nies, but he would have never 
thought that he would be praised 
for his new “moderate” views on 
terrorism and human rights.

Editor:
It was with great anticipation 
that I read Mr. Fartro’s column in 
last week’s Tartan [“So long Ron, 
you will be missed,” 2/7]. As in 
the past, I eagerly awaited the in­
sightful commentary that Mr. 
Fartro offers. One point, however, 
is clearly erroneous, and I cannot 
help but bring it to his attention.
In the second paragraph, Mr. 
Fartro states that “Reagan man­
aged to pull the highest popular­
ity ratings in the last 30 years.” 
However, data does not support 
this claim. Consider the follow­
ing: First, in Reagan’s first term, 
his approval rating averaged 50%, 
lower than the average for Eisen­
hower (69%), Kennedy (71%), 
Johnson (52%) and Nixon (56%), 
and not significantly greater than 
that for Carter (47%).
. Second, Reagan’s peak approval 
during that period (68%) was 
lower than the peaks for Eisen­
hower (79%), Kennedy (83%), 
Johnson (80%), and Carter (75%), 
and not significantly higher than 
that for Nixon (67%). And finally, 
Reagan’s low (35%) was signifi­
cantly lower than that for Eisen­
hower and Kennedy, and matched 
Johnson’s low, although he did 
not manage to reach Nixon’s low 
of 24% (which occurred just be­
fore he resigned).
Thus by any of the measures — 
average popularity, peak popu­
larity, and popularity low point
— Mr. Fartro’s claim is unsub­
stantiated. I should point out 
that this data only covers Re­
agan’s first term.
'o88o1V 8i 8no 6,58i1
However, I think that the events 
of Reagan’s second term (a few of 
which Mr. Fartro himself points 
out, plus several that he omits), 
such as the Iran-Contra affair, 
the attack on Libya, the misguided 
policy towards Panama, or the 
shooting down of the Iranian air­
bus, clearly indicate that a pro­
found turnaround which might 
validate Mr. Fartro’s claim did 
not happen.
I’m sorry that Mr. Fartro has 
“only NBC, ABC and CBS to in­
form [himself).” It is interesting 
that he seems so concerned with 
current issues, yet he cannot 
bother to look beyond the net­
work news.
For example, it is unclear to me 
why Mr. Fartro cannot listen to 
National Public Radio, or watch 
the MacNeil Lehrer News Hour 
on PBS. For reading material, 
may I suggest the Christian Sci 
ence Monitor, or even the New 
York Times or Washington Post. 
This is of course only a partial list 
of the many sources of informa­
tion available to those who are 
willing to put even a modest 
amount of effort into looking into 
this issue.

The President has a new car. 
He rode in it just after his swear- 
ing-in on Inauguration Day. News 
commentators gushed over its ca­
pabilities. As I understand it, the 
custom-built limousine is bullet­
proof, dust proof, has tilted seats, 
a smoke producer, a loudspeaker, 
a bar, a large-screen television, a 
kitchen (capable of cooking a meal 
for 40), a Jacuzzi, a steam room, 
and a squash court.
S18 »3rn4Ca,
What frightens me the most 
about the car is something Dan 
Rather said. He mentioned that 
the limo, and I am not making 
this up, was constructed in such a 
way that the President could 
conduct a nuclear war from the 
inside of it.
If true, this is very worrying.
I can just imagine the scene 
where the car salesman briefs the 
President on the features of his 
new automobile.
“Now, Mr. President, this but­
ton here controls the tempera­
ture, this one open up the roof, 
this is the light dimmer and this 
one launches every ICBM in our 
stockpile.”
“I see. Let me get it straight — 
this button opens the roof.”
“No, sir, that’s the temperature 
gauge. The one that operates the
"What’s this button for?”
“With that you can start a conven­
tional war.... If we put it higher, it 
could get confused with the stereo 
buttons. ”
roof is next to it.”
“I see. Then this button dims 
the lights.”
“No, that one launches the 
nuclear missiles. The light dim­
mer is over here.”
“Why can’t the nuclear button 
be separated from the others so I 
don’t get them mixed up?”
“That would have added to he 
cost of the car, and the budget 
planner felt that since you would 
be using the nuclear button so 
seldom, it wasn’t worth the 
money.”
“What’s this button for?”
“With that you can start a con­
ventional war or roll down the 
windows.”
“Do you think that’s the best 
place for it since my grandchil­
dren may be riding in the car?” 
“If we put it higher, it could get 
confused with the stereo buttons. 
There was some talk of installing 
it in the glove compartment, but 
then it would be hard to reach 
from the back seat.”

“Arriving at the campus, I went di­
rectly to Donner Hall where I was told 
I could find my hostess. After catch­
ing one glimpse of the aqua-colored 
structure, I wished it were made of 
steel. Is there really a school of archi­
tecture at this university?”
The following letter is from a 
Carmel, Ind., high school student 
mho visited Carnegie Mellon as a 
sleeping bagger last November. — 
fid.
Editor:
The trip from Carmel, Ind. to 
s588V(31Pn was uneventful. Of 
course, traveling through the 
state of Ohio does not offer too 
much excitement.
But I barely noticed the hay­
stacks and the bustling city of 
Columbus, because I was on my 
way to visit Carnegie Mellon 
University.
I am a high school senior wish­
ing to study communications. I 
have my eye on CMU, not because 
the school colors are plaid (I’m a 
flaming preppie), not because my 
boyfriend is also considering it, 
but because I am interested in the 
professional writing program. I 
visited as a participant in the 
Sleeping Bag Weekend on No­
vember 6 and 7, 1988.
En route to Pittsburgh, I pon­
dered what the city and univer­
sity might be like. At that point I 
associated only three things with
Pittsburgh: steel, steel, and steel. 
I thought maybe CMU wpuld be 
housed in steel complexes, in tune 
with the thriving industry of Pitts­
burgh.
Boy, was I wrong.
Arriving at the campus, my 
mother and I went directly to 
Donner Hall, where I was told I 
could find my hostess. After catch­
ing one glimpse of the aqua-col­
ored structure, I wished it were 
made of steel. Is there really a 
school of architecture at this uni­
versity?
But I held hard and fast to the 
philosophy I established before 
the trip: keep an open mind and 
don’t say you hate it until you’ve 
seen it all.
But with little regard to this 
philosophy, I said, “Mom, I hate 
it.” Yeah, what an open mind.
I thought maybe my hostess 
could point out some redeeming 
qualities of Donner Hall, but that 
was impossible, because she was 
not in her room to greet me. I was 
not about to comb Donner Hall 
looking for her. Instead, I encoun­
tered about five or six guys piled 
on top of beds, desks, and the floor
in my assigned room (about three 
by three feet in size — tops). An 
open mind is one thing, but breath­
ing room is a completely different 
matter. I would spend the night 
with her in the Holiday Inn in 
downtown Pittsburgh.
Speaking of Pittsburgh, I was 
ashamed of my preconceived no­
tion. It’s a beautiful city and bears 
bears a striking resemblance to 
Chicago. Of course I disagree with 
the Pitt pronunciation of Carne­
gie. The first lesson I learned was 
the the “a” does not receive the 
stress, but rather the first “e.”
Well, that first night I went to
bed with a heavy heart, disap­
pointed with my initial impres­
sion of CMU. But tomorrow was 
another day.
The following day included a 
breakfast in the cafeteria, a tour, 
and an interview for admissions. 
I expected the college food to be 
nothing to write home about, but 
I was pleasantly surprised. How­
ever, I felt extremely silly milling 
around the eating area looking 
for a table; I do not look the age of 
a college student, or a junior high 
school student, for that matter.
The campus tour would be in­
teresting, I was sure, but I did not
relish the thought of running 
around the campus in the bitter 
cold listening to college history 
and traditions. Again, I was 
thrown for a loop. The tour was 
informative and interesting.
I learned that Donner Hall is 
not a good basis forjudging CMU. 
Since I arrived after dark the night 
before, I barely got a good look. 
The campus is actually quite 
charming (Ah! The reappearance 
of the elusive open mind!), with 
traditions to match. I liked the 
idea of the techni-color, graffiti- 
ridden Fence; however, I was not 
amused to hear about small girls 
being pushed down hills in bug­
gies (I’m barely five feet tall).
At one point during the tour, 
the guide pointed out a blond 
young man whom she said would 
be famous, by virtue of his acting 
ability. I studied him intensely, 
but already my memory fails to 
recall his face. I occasionally scan 
television commercials, hoping to 
see him. So far, nothing.
The tour made my view of CMU 
take a complete turn for the bet­
ter, which put me in the right 
frame of mind for the interview.
After the interview, we had 
some time to kill before leaving, 
so we visited The Tartan newspa­
per office. I am editor-in-chief of 
my high school newspaper, and I 
wanted to see how The Tartan 
operated. I spoke with some edi­
tors and discovered that we had a 
lot in common. At a school as 
diverse as CMU, I knew I could 
find a niche somewhere, and The 
Tartan would provide that. With 
such a small staff, I knew it would 
be easier to be more prominent 
than at a large school, where I 
would just be a number. ;
I don’t know if I will go tOlCMU, 
but I have decided that It is a 
unique institution. I don’t” know 
of any other that produces actors, 
engineers, artists, painted fences, 
and dormitories that are eyesores 
on such a large scale.
We left The Tartan office^ ready 
to go back home. But before we 
got to the car, I turned ground 
and said, “Mom, I love it.”

SportspeakLady Tartans singin’ the St. Louis blues
io, Elle didn’t 
nake the cover
Two of the most anxiously 
aited anniversaries of the 
fear came about last week;
)avid Letterman’s 7th, but 
nore importantly, Sports 
llustrated’s 25th anniversary 
¡wimsuit Issue.
See, since the Swimsuit Issue 
strategically planned to come 
jut in the “lull” of the sports 
rear — the period between the 
super Bowl and Spring Train-
— I might as well follow 
uit. Nothing much is happen- 
ng around here since Pitts- 
lurgh ain’t got no basketball 
.earn. As for hockey, everybody 
ind his mother is writing about 
he Penguins, and I would never 
rant to be accused of “following 
he crowd.” So, last week while I 
/as waiting on line with a 
lottle of Evian water and some 
)reos, I pulled out an extra 
,3.95, and bought the coveted 
¡wimsuit Issue.
Everybody blasts SI because 
if the Swimsuit Issue (dubbed 
,i. by the magazine itself).
’eople accuse the magazine of 
xploiting women, sexism, bad 
aste, even practicing in the 
orruption of the American 
outh. Yeah right. These are the 
ame people who buy their kids 
I. Joe and Barbie dolls (by the 
ray, the big busted Babs 
elebrated her 30th anniversary, 
ast week) because of their 
wholesomeness.” Anyway,
¡nough with the social commen- 
ary.
As I was flipping through the 
ssue I noticed something I had 
lever noticed in previous issues: 
ext. There was a time when SI 
vas one of the best written and 
nost informative sports maga- 
ines around. But soon, fans be- 
¡an reading it for the more ob- 
cure stories and standings, and 
specially for the dynamite pljp- 
ography. For the s.i., a few 
heesecake photos with some 
ext about fishing in Bora Bora 
lelped make the issue a best- 
eller and a uniquely American 
inmial event.
In this year’s anniversary is- 
ue, there is a well written and 
iteresting story about each of 
he covergirls over the last 25 
ears. I was taken by the story 
fAnn Simonton, the 1974 
overgirl who gave up a success- 
iil modeling career to become a 
rusader for feminism. Ironi- 
ally, one of her biggest causes 
to get SI to stop producing 
he Swimsuit Issue.
Heading through the SI s.i., I 
iarned a bit about the model- 
ig industry, the fashion 
ndustry, and how a national 
lagazine operates. However, I 
nderstand Simonton’s and 
thers’ points of view. Most 
eople do only read the maga- 
ine for the photos. But, not all 
[ those readers are men. The 
'agazine did a survey and 
'und that over half the reader- 
top of last year’s issue was 
¡male.
The old joke about the s.i. is 
*at it does women a service by 
bowing them some of the latest 
lshions for the upcoming 
swimwear season.” As with any 
°°d joke, the reason it is funny 
that there is actually some 
‘uth to it. Women take interest 
1 the issue for the same reason 
ley take interest in fashion 
lagazines like Vogue or Elle.
The Swimsuit Issue has 
ecome an institution over the 
1st 25 years. Instead of scruti- 
lz^g it, let’s all just sit back 
&d enjoy it.

Tartan Staffwriter
For the Lady Tartans, last week 
was full of good times and bad 
times. Last Wednesday, Carne­
gie Mellon clinched at least a tie 
for the Presidents’ Athletic Con­
ference (PAC) title with an 81-38 
grounding of the John Carroll 
Blue Streaks (7-11; 3-5 PAC). 
However, Saturday night, they 
were mauled by University Ath­
letic Association (UAA) rivals, the 
Washington University (Wash U) 
Bears in St. Louis, 57-14.
The loss drops the Lady Tar­
tans to 16-5 overall (9-0 PAC, 5-3 
UAA) and will most likely drop 
out of their third place ranking in 
the Mid-Atlantic region.
“We might fall out of the rank­
ings in our division and we proba­
bly won’t go to the playoffs. We’re 
still planning to go undefeated in 
the PAC; we still have a goal,” 
said co-captain Beth Virgin.
The Lady Tartans travelled to 
St. Louis for one of the biggest 
games of the year against Wash 
U. The Lady Bears came into the 
game ranked fifth in the Central 
region with a 15-5 record. The 
game was so pivotal to the rank­
ings in both regions that many 
regional and national directors 
were paying close attention to the 
outcome.
Saturday’s game saw the Lady 
Tartans play catch-up all night, 
down by as many as nine in the 
first half. At the end of the first 
twenty minutes, the Lady Tar­
tans had an 8-0 run, highlighted 
by WRCT player of the game Katie 
Fahey’s basket at the buzzer, 
which tied the contest at 28-28.
The first half was also full of
bad play by Carnegie Mellon, as 
Wash U put CMU in foul trouble 
early. With 5:11 to go in the half, 
center Tricia Chorgo picked up 
her third personal foul. Soon af­
ter, Virgin picked up her second 
and the Lady Tartans had trouble 
keeping the Lady Bears from 
penetrating the defense. Carne­
gie Mellon’s Head Coach Gerri 
Seidl remarked before the game 
how important defense was going 
to be. “Wash U likes to penetrate. 
Virgin, Chorgo and [Aimee] Re- 
ber have to play great defense 
and stay out of foul trouble.”
The problems of the first half 
continued and got worse in the 
second half. In the first thirteen 
minutes of play in the second 
stanza, the Lady Tartans were 
outscored 16-8 and only scored 
six more the rest of the way. On 
the night, CMU shot only 20 per­
cent from the floor in the second 
half, and a meager 26 percent for 
the game. Disaster reared its ugly 
head with six minutes to go in the 
game when, with the score 46-38, 
Amy Buxbaum, a freshman from 
Johnstown, fouled out. She was 
followed to the bench thirty-five 
seconds later by Chorgo, fouling 
out with Carnegie Mellon down 
by six points, 46-40.
“The thing that was the worst 
was fouls. Maybe, too, we weren’t 
used to playing [against] such big 
girls,” said Chorgo.
The Lady Tartans were victim­
ized by sloppy offensive play all 
night. Their pick and roll offense 
was defended excellently by a 
stingy Wash U defense that held 
CMU to only 14 second half points. 
Contributing to the Lady Tartans’ 
woes was rebounding, where 
Wash U held a 49-35 advantage.
Wash U was led by Karen Her­
mann, who netted 12 points and 
led all rebounders with 12 boards. 
Sonya Thompson added 10 points 
to the cause. The Bears shot 46 
percent from the field for-'the 
game, and held Carnegie Mellon 
scoreless for 5:29 minutes from 
the 5:30 mark to the final second 
of the game.
For the first time this season, 
the Lady Tartans did not :have 
anyone in double figures.: Co­
captain Lisa Lightner led thé way 
with nine first half points,' but 
was shut out in the second half. 
Fahey had eight points for the 
Lady Tartans and Lisa Smith and 
Reber both scored six.
The game against John Carroll 
(JCU) was completely opposite of 
what happened against Wash U. 
After taking a 14 point half time 
lead, CMU blew out the Blue 
Streaks 46-17 in the second half 
and coasted to an easy win.
Lightner was the leading scorer 
for the Lady Tartans, putting in
16 first half points and adding 18 
more in the second half to finish 
the night with a career high of 34 
points. Lightner was unstoppable, 
hitting 14 of 24 from the field, five 
of nine from the three point range 
and one of two from the line.
“I didn’t know how many; she 
had, ’’remarked Seidl. “She wasn’t 
in there to get a career high, I 
kept her in because she was play­
ing a complete game. Lisa shot 
well, played great defense, and 
even penetrated the lane.”
Not only were the Lady Tartans 
playing well, the Blue Streaks 
were playing poorly. They turned 
the ball over 29 times and only 
shot 23 percent for the game.

Hockey club loses to Pitt
By DAVID WILLIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon hockey 
club suffered a double defeat at 
the hands of Pitt last Wednes­
day, losing the game and the 
services of sophomore tri-cap­
tain Denny Frey.
In what has been the biggest 
game of the season so far for the 
team, the Tartans displayed no 
offense, coming up on the short 
end of a 6-3 score on their home 
ice in Monroeville. Junior tri­
captain Mark Robson was dis­
appointed in the team’s overall 
level of play. “The first line 
hasn’t been producing,” he com­
plained, adding that the second
line played well. Robson noted in 
particular the efforts of left win­
ger Neil Smith, a graduate stu­
dent from Ontario who scored two 
goals in the game. Freshman Dave 
Sealfon continues to receive praise 
for his work in goal, but Robson 
was critical of the team defense. 
“He [Sealfon] received no support 
in front of the net.”
The game’s biggest story may 
be the loss of Frey, who was ejected 
from Wednesday’s contest and 
suspended from the team’s next 
game against Indiana University 
of Pennsylvania. In a controver­
sial call, Frey was thrown out for 
“attempting to injure” a Pitt 
player during an on-ice alterca­
tion. The Pitt player involved es­
caped with a two minute pen­
alty for roughing. The Tartans, 
claiming the penalty was more 
one-sided than the actual event, 
are appealing the ruling 
through the league office.
With two games to play in the 
Western Pennsylvania Colle­
giate Hockey Association, the 
Tartans stand at 5-3-2. They 
need wins against IUP and Slip­
pery Rock this weekend to en­
sure a playoff spot. Their goal 
is to face the Panthers in the 
finals, where Robson feels the 
Tartans could win. Last year, 
the club crushed Pitt 5-0 in the 
semifinals after losing the two 
regular season games to the 
Panthers.
Men’s team loses 
two on the road
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor
ST. LOUIS—Plain and simple, 
it was an ugly week for the men’s 
basketball Tartans.
First, the team’s leading scorer 
Darryl Long went down with an 
injured knee. Second, the Tar­
tans ended their four-game win­
ning streak with a 61-44 loss in 
Cleveland to John Carroll. Third, 
they ran into the playoff-bound 
Washington Bears and limped out 
of St. Louis with an 86-49 whip­
ping.
For the second time this sea­
son, the Tartans lost their lead­
ing scorer to a knee injury. For 
the second time this season, the
loss came after a winning streak. 
For the second time this season, it
happened at the worst-possible 
moment. After feasting on the 
bottom of the President’s Athletic 
Conference (PAC), the Tartans 
faced two teams contending to 
defend their respective PAG and 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) titles.
After losing Long midway 
through the first half of Wednes­
day’s game, CMU was able to score 
a season-low 44 points. Senior co­
captain Daren Moffatt scored 14 
points to lead the Tartans and 
helped senior David Sikora clean 
up the boards. The two combined 
for 13 rebounds. John Carroll’s

Swimmers sweep Grove City
By JOEY LYNN MONACO
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Carnegie Mellon’s swim teams 
defeated Grove City Saturday, the 
men’s team ending with a score of 
108-97 and the women’s team with 
a score of 87-59. The men had to 
fight to the last race for their win, 
while the women swam away with 
a solid margin.
For the women, Jo Wollsch- 
laeger set both a new pool record 
and a new school record in the 
1000 yd. freestyle with a time of 
11:26.99. Brian Zimmerman set 
pool and school records in the 
same event for the men at 9:26.99; 
Norman Murray came through 
with a much-needed second place 
at 10:27.53.
Both teams were in good form. 
The women had an advantage 
over Grove City with a larger and 
more established swim program 
than the first year seven member 
Lady Wolverines team.
The men faced stricter competi­
tion. Like last week’s face-off 
against Slippery Rock, it was the 
last race that decided the meet.
As the regular season ends and 
the University Athletic Associa­
tion (UAA) championships draws 
near, the team members reflect 
on the past and anticipate the 
upcoming meets. Wollschlaeger, 
when asked about her string of 
broken records, stressed the hard 
work that went into the wins, and 
the work left to do before nation­
als. Zimmerman concurred. He 
must still qualify, while Wollsch­
laeger has already made her time.
Reflecting on this season, sen­
ior co-captains David Chaimber- 
lin and Greg Schooley consider it 
the best they’ve seen, attributing 
a major part of their success to 
the leadership of Head Coach Jim 
Perkins. Chaimberlin calls him a 
“natural salesman” in the recruit­
ment process, * and Schooley 
praises his structured training 
methods, citing his own time 
reductions as a testament to 
Perkins’ success.
This was Perkins’ last home 
meet with his team, this being his 
last season at CMU. His team 
members universally praise his 
leadership, citing especially his 
expertise in creating lineups in 
order to give the team the best ad­
vantage. Perkins knows not only

his own team and their abilities, 
but also the opponents. He based 
the lineups of the last five meets 
on the performances of the indi­
viduals on both the CMU and the 
opposing teams, which was flex­
ible’ enough for last-minute 
changes.
Perkins is reserved about the 
upcoming UAA championships. 
He feels that his men’s team will 
finish about 5th place—their fin­
ishing slot last year. The women 
finished 8th; he forsees similar 
results this year, although he 
hopes they may come out higher.
The men finished their regular 
season undefeated. The last time 
a Tartan men’s swim team ac­
complished this feat was in 1958, 
when the team earned ten victo­
ries againstnolosses. Former Sen­
ior Vice President for Academic 
Affairs Pat Crecine was a mem- 
ber>of the team that season.

Last week was an exciting one 
in the land of IM Men’s Basket­
ball’. In a battle of the Intermedi­
ate Midwest undefeated teams, 
the Zoo toppled the Squad, 42-36. 
In the Atlantic division of the 
same league, the Lakers defeated 
the SAE Seniors.
The lead in the first half of the 
game between the Sqaud and the 
Zoo was tossed back and forth. 
The Zoo took an early three point 
lead. The Squad’s Mike Miller 
gave his team the necessary points 
to get the team back into the game 
before the Zoo’s lead became too 
large. Miller made two consecu­
tive baskets to give the Squad a 
narrow one point lead. The Zoo’s 
Kirk Lowery also scored four 
points in the first period, giving 
the Zoo a 10-8 lead as the first pe­
riod ended.
The second period opened with 
a pair of Zoo fouls. The Squad 
capitalized on this and in less 
than a minute, the Squad had 
regained the lead, putting four 
points between them and the Zoo. 
Lowery made seven consecutive 
points for the Zoo which put them 
back on top by a point.
As time was running out in the 
second period, the two teams 
continued fighting for the lead. 
The Squad’s Brian Kellon made
the basket that gave the Squad a 
one point lead at the half, 22-21.
Throughout the first half of the 
game, the lead changed nine 
times.
The second half of the game 
was dominated by the Squad. The 
team already had a lead that it 
would not give it up for the rest of 
the game. The Zoo desperately 
tried to catch up, but the Squad 
defense was too strong for the Zoo 
offense. By the end of the third 
period, the one point lead had 
increased to four.
The fourth period started with 
four unanswered points by the 
Squad. The Zoo cut the Squad’s 
lead from eight to four points 
before calling a time-out. With 
the score 40-36, the Zoo needed 
two baskets in fourteen seconds. 
Jay Glaspy of the Squad stole the 
ball from the Zoo and added two 
points to his team’s score before 
the game ended. The Squad is 
now 2-0, while the Zoo falls to 1-1.
Last Wednesday, a group of 
University Dining Services work­
ers, calling themselves the Lak­
ers, went up against the SAE 
Seniors. In their first game, the 
Lakers showed everyone that they 
were a team not to be taken lightly.
The SAE Seniors went score­
less in the first period while the 
Lakers scored six points. On de­
fense, the Lakers were also im­
pressive, stealing the ball from
the Seniors three times and block­
ing two of their shots.
The second period opened with 
SAE scoring two consecutive bas­
kets. The Lakers replied with a 
basket of their own, followed by a 
SAE turnover and another bas­
ket. SAE was able to match the 
Lakers point for point in the sec­
ond period. The score at the end of 
the second period was 12-6 in 
favor of the Lakers.
The third period opened with 
some dazzling moves. Robert Faye 
of the Lakers went up for a bas­
ket. While he was flying through 
the air, he made a beautiful be­
hind the back pass to one of his 
teammates, who was unable to 
complete the play. The SAE Sen­
iors scored the first points of the 
third period, but the Lakers would 
not let SAE cut into their lead 
until the last seconds of the quar­
ter. SAE scored with seconds left 
to cut the Laker lead to four points. 
The score at the end of the third 
period was 19-15.
The Lakers dominated the 
fourth period, increasing their 
lead to nine points. The SAE 
Seniors came back with eight 
consecutive points to cut the Laker 
lead to one. With 1:24 left to play, 
the Lakers went on nine point 
tear to secure their victory. The 
final score was 41-33.
The Lakers’ record is 1-0, and 
the SAE Seniors drop to 1-1.

eighth points gave the Bears a 
15-14 lead, one which they 
would never relinquish. By the 
end of the half, he already had 
17 points and Washington 
owned a 35-30 lead.
CMU may have just as well 
stayed in the locker room in the 
second half. The Bear defense, 
ranked fifth in Division III, 
went to work while the Bear 
offense lit up the scoreboard.
One night after a Bear set a 
school record by hitting seven 
three-pointers against Johns 
Hopkins, the Washington gun­
ners were still on target.
The Bears hit seven three- 
pointers in the second half, 
while the Tartans were only 
able to muster six field goals in 
the same half.
“We missed, they didn’t,” 
summarized Harvey Beckham. 
Added Robert Sechan, “We were 
hitting absolutely nothing, we 
needed an explosive scorer.”
The Bear lead started at five 
but quickly grew. Runs of 
twelve and eight straight points 
swelled Washington’s lead to 
62-36 in 10 minutes.
The Tartans never put to- 
. gether more than two consecu­
tive scores in the final half, los-
ond-place John Carroll.
“Grove City is in the PAC, 
and we are still in contention,” 
says Sechan. “With good play 
and a little luck, we can still 
take the PAC.”
The first time the two teams 
met this season, Grove City left 
Skibo Gym with a 75-59 victory 
in a sloppy foul-filled game, 
marred by Carnegie Mellon’s 
worst shooting of the season; 
the Tartans were able to make 
only 30 percent of their shots 
from the floor.
The Tartans return home Sat­
urday for their final home game 
of the season against Thiel Col­
lege (1-7 PAC, 3-17 overall).
The hapless Tomcats have 
won only three games this sea­
son, and lost 66-55 to Carnegie 
Mellon two weeks ago. The win 
was one of only two road wins 
this season.
The lone bright spot for Thiel 
has been the play of junior Eric 
Bielata, who is 12th in the na­
tion in rebounding.
Wednesday’s game will be on 
WRCT 88.3 FM beginning at 8 
pm. Saturday’s game starts at 
2 pm. Senior co-captains Long, 
Moffatt, and Sikora will be hon­
ored.

Urie Winograd works on a wall at Cimini Hair Desl|
Graffiti artist paints for causes
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor

Atlel yl«CefSs hCpf Fp9lLC-p 
The word “Funk” Dainted on a wall in southeast Washington D.C
Arie Winograd has realized the dream 
of every three year old: to draw on the 
walls and be praised for it.
Winograd and fellow graffiti artist 
Jerry Inscoe and Kinjale Mitra were 
commissioned last October to do a graf­
fiti mural on an interior wall at Cimini 
Hair Design on Craig street. Winograd is 
a sophomore in the college of Humani­
ties and Social Sciences. Mitra and In­
scoe are not Carnegie Mellon students.
The painting has been completed and 
Cimini’s Manager Carl Cimini is thrilled 
with it. He has invited Winograd back to 
do another Wall and says, “We get a lot of 
good response from the customers. Eve­
rybody loves it.”
Although Cimini believes Winograd 
does good work, this is one of the few 
times Winograd has been praised by the 
people on whose property he paints.
Winograd has been a graffiti artist for 
the last two or three years.
Growing up in Reston, Virginia, near 
Washington, D.C., he started doing his 
artwork towards the end of high school.
Winograd says he has always been 
somewhat interested in art but said that 
a few years ago, “I was kind of at a point 
where I was really frustrated. I had a lot 
of things I wanted to express but people 
wouldn’t listen to me and I felt by doing 
[graffiti] artwork where people had to 
see what I was doing ... I could express 
myself to the world.”
According to Winograd, his expression 
usually comes through the colors and 
shapes in his work. He calls graffiti a 
form of calligraphy.
The ideas expressed in Winograd’s 
graffiti are usually social issues. He says 
that he does a lot of paintings with anti­
drug, civil rights, and pro-black militant 
themes.
Although he lives in the Washington 
area and has done much of his graffiti 
there (including hitting the Department
hown here is one 
f Arie’s works, 
“The Surf.” It has 
been partially 
ainted over — a 
'common problem1 
for the Graffiti Artist
This policeman was done in Reston, Va.
of the Interior a few times), Winograd 
says that he avoids popular political is­
sues. “I’m not happy with the Reagan ad­
ministration and all,” he said, “but too 
many people do ‘anti’ themes like that. I 
come up with more original stuff.”
The best place to do graffiti, according to 
Winograd, is on moving vehicles, such as 
trains, so that everyone, including other 
graffiti artists, can see one’s work.
Winograd says his favorite targets in 
Washington are abandoned buildings, 
underpasses, and occasionally tractor 
trailers. He does not paint on private 
property and the trains in Washington 
are made to be immune to graffiti. The 
paint simply beads up.
Graffiti artists adopt working names 
called “tags” so that their graffiti can be 
identified but not traced back to the artist. 
Winograd declined to give his tag but said 
that some of the artists who have influ­
enced him are known as “Buda” (a Pitts­
burgher) and “T-kid” and “Sent” in New 
York.
Winograd lived in Brooklyn during his 
early childhood and has returned to New 
York many times to visit friends and 
practice his art. He explained that graffiti 
began in New York 15 years ago and has 
thrived there, largely on subway trains. 
He said that New York graffiti has been 
dying recently, though. He attributes this 
to the new paint resistant trains and to 
the growing popularity of crack among
the ghetto kids who have been the 
heart of New York graffiti. He la­
mented, “I’ve seen too many great 
[graffiti] writers go down the drain. 
Either they’re smoking the [crack] pipe 
t ... or their dealing and they don’t give 
a damn about art any more.”
Even though he has done some legal 
pieces, such as Cimini’s wall and a 
cafeteria wall in his high school, Win­
ograd said, “Usually I like doing illegal 
pieces because I believe graffiti be­
longs on the street where the common 
person can see it.” Winograd does not 
know if he will do the other wall he has 
been asked to paint at Cimini’s. If he 
does, he intends to stick to his personal 
rule of refusing to accept payment. He 
said that “I honestly don’t like doing 
graffiti for money. I don’t mind free 
paint but I feel when you start getting 
paid for your art, you’re doing it for the 
wrong purpose.”
Like most graffiti artists, Winograd 
has had close calls with the police. He 
says that he and his friends often end 
up having to run away from paintings. 
However, Winograd considers this part 
of the fun. “It’s an adventure. That’s 
what graffiti’s all about,” he contends.
He has been caught once,“<Wi the day 
after his eighteenth birthday. His pun­
ishment was to spend 50 hours paint­
ing his graffiti over what he called “shit 
graffiti,” graffiti painted as vandalism 
rather than as art.
Hoping to turn his social concerns 
into a career as a human rights lawyer 
or a criminologist, Winograd is pursu­
ing a self defined major in H&SS. He is 
following a curriculum that concen­
trates on history, anthropology, and 
sociology.
However, whatever he ends up doing, 
Winograd will probably always love 
graffiti. “The whole thing about graf­
fiti,” he said, “is it’s about individual 
style [and] originality and it’s about 
who you are, expressing yourself in 
original innovative ways.”

Alieva’s class takes active approach
By DEBORAH J. SAX
Tartan Staffwriter
It’s only three weeks into the 
semester, and already some stu­
dents are getting burnt out. Many 
of us find ourselves doing our 
assignments mindlessly, realiz­
ing that we aren’t learning much, 
if anything, but knowing that we 
must do the work if we want to 
“get the grade.”
Later, we find ourselves listless 
during lectures, not really get­
ting anything out of them, but 
knowing that we’d feel guilty if 
we skipped.
Our minds wander, and we 
conjure up images of a perfect 
educational system. Perhaps we 
dream of pass/fail classes, or self 
designed majors. Maybe we de­
sire to take fewer classes at a 
time, or for lectures to be abol­
ished.
Whatever the vision, most us 
think that our educational sys­
tem should be different.
Although we think about the 
flaws of our system, we rarely 
attempt to take action to change 
•them. In fact, we don’t even know 
if our ideal would ever succeed.
Knowledge, Values and Educa­
tion (80-290), which is being of­
fered this semester by the phi­
losophy department, is a class in 
which such topics are discussed.
The course focuses on the many 
controversial issues involving
education.
The most unique feature of the 
class is the philosophy of the 
educator behind it. The course is 
taught by Professor Ernest Al­
ieva.
Stating no formal philosophy of 
education, Alieva believes that 
the best learning occurs when 
students take an active part in 
their own educational experience. 
He has displayed this philosophy 
in his previous classes by encour­
aging lively discussions, and by 
sometimes playing the devil’s 
advocate to force his students to 
examine the rational and irra­
tional thoughts behind their be­
liefs.
Alieva has always encouraged 
students to express their opin­
ions, and his enthusiasm for learn­
ing has been described as “conta­
gious.”
With this course, Alieva made 
his style less formal; he teaches 
this course without a formal syl­
labus and without a systematic 
grading system.
Since the course has no sylla­
bus, the students decide what 
they want to read and discuss in 
the class.
In addition, the members of the 
class vote on the method of grad­
ing for themselves. If they wish, 
students can decide to grade them­
selves, be graded by their peers, 
or to opt for a more traditional
form of grading, via exam or pro­
fessor evaluation.
Students’ reactions on format 
are varied. Some consider the 
class to be blow-off at first, be­
cause the course requirements 
were not stated in full on the first 
day.
Others are a bit perturbed that 
the grading system may not be 
fair, and still others find some of 
the discussions to be a bit to ran­
dom and hard to follow.
Most students, however, find 
the class to be a wonderful break 
from the monotony that exists in 
many of their current classes.
In Alieva’s class, what students 
wish to learn is important, and 
their learning is not hindered by 
pressure regarding standards of 
grading.
When asked for his reasons for 
the structuring of the course, 
Alieva stated that the purpose is 
multi-fold. He feels the subject 
matter of the course — education 
and its functions and flaws — 
lends itself well to this type of 
open format.
In addition, the course seems to 
be designed with regard to Al­
ieva’s own philosophy of educa­
tion.
Although Alieva finds it hard to 
put his philosophy into words, he 
is a strong advocate of active learn­
ing.
Alieva finds this to be one un­
settling difference between him­
self and the students he is educat­
ing today. “In all of my years at 
Columbia, I never had anyone 
assign to me a paper topic. In all 
cases, I chose the topic myself. 
Yet, many of the students that I 
have taught have an extremely 
difficult time doing this.”
Alieva, attempting to promote 
active learning, designed the 
course so that student initiative, 
creativity, and self-motivated, 
original thought are essential to 
the course.
Although the course is less 
structured and less formal than 
all of the other courses offered at 
CMU, it is definitely not a free for 
all.
With Alieva’s guidance, the stu­
dents decide what they want to 
read for the next class. Usually, 
they are asked to write a one page 
response to each article or chap­
ter.
The responses are reviewed by 
Alieva, not for content as much as 
for logical argument and citing 
examples to support one’s conclu­
sions.
Each student is also respon­
sible for a final project of some 
kind; the subject matter and the 
means of displaying it are en­
tirely up to the student.
Alieva has suggested films and 
class lectures as possible final 
projects, but he is quite welcome 
to creative suggestions; in fact, he 
prefers them.
Many think that the for­
mat used by Alieva is one 
which makes it it easier on 
the professor. Alieva, how­
ever, insists that this is 
not the case.
In fact, he feels that his 
teaching style is more dif­
ficult. It is easier, he states, 
to hand out a syllabus in 
the beginning of a course, 
for then, the bulk of his 
work is completed.
Being constantly open to 
suggestions and course 
revisions, however re­
quires constant preparation.
When your class is run open- 
endedly, you have to be prepared 
to meet the students’ demands.
His biggest disappointment as 
a professor is probably that “stu-
photo by Jason Schrr 
Philosophy Professor Ernie Alieva thin) 
of some possible topics for his class.
years. He designs and teach 
courses that focus largely 
modern ethics issues.
The underlying question is 
course, is this style of teachii 
effective?: i.e. will the studen 
dents don’t take advantage of me learn anything in “Knowledg 
enough.” Alieva views himself, as Values and Education?”
well as other professors, as valu­
able resources to the students; 
resources that are too often ne­
glected. “It is the rare student 
who comes to me for advice or for 
help on a personal project or idea.” 
Alieva wishes that it were a much 
more frequent occurrence.
Alieva’s style and philosophy of 
education are not totally unique, 
as he recalls being influenced by 
several professors while in un­
dergraduate and graduate school 
at Columbia University.
Alieva has been a faculty 
member at CMU for about six
It seems to me, as a student 
Alieva’s and from discussing t 
course with others, that passi 
learning is no substitute for r 
self initiated and motivated 
tive learning.
I hold a strong faith that at tl 
end of spring semester, the st 
dents will have learned mu 
about the various education 
formats, as well as become mu 
more active learners: studen 
willing to take at least part 
responsibility for their own ed 
cation.

Carnegie Mellon begins celebrity endorsements campaign
By now we have all heard of 
the so-called “Cola Wars.” Coca- 
Cola has coerced George Michael 
and Bill Cosby into hawking 
their foul brew and Pepsi Cola 
has retorted by hiring the likes 
of Michael Jackson and Madonna 
to publicly admit to drinking the 
syrupy concoction in question.
To an outsider such as myself 
these antics might seem some­
what comical and perhaps 
slightly telling of the state of big 
business in America — at least 
until yesterday.
Yesterday I made a startling 
discovery which has brought an 
epiq struggle very similar to that 
of the cola companies into our 
own back yard.
We are all familiar with the 
now defunct Beaux Arts Ball; 
once I found out about the can­
cellation of the Ball, I set out to 
find the true reason why the ad­
ministration had seen fit to put 
its foot down in such a forceful 
manner. All of my attempts at 
discovering the truth were 
thwarted, until I went to Hunt.
In my frustration, I sat down to 
read the latest issue of The Wall 
Street Journal, (there were about 
fifty other people in line to read 
the USA Today), and one of the 
front page headlines caught my 
eye:

Campaign
The article was chock full of
details, but the most notable one 
was “Musician Lionel Richie dis­
closed that he was being paid an
end of the UHF dial and has the 
only channel number I know that 
has a fraction attached to it) and 
watched for the Lionel Richie/ 
CMU commercial. Sure enough, 
there it was, and it was a little bit 
hard to believe:
Night. The Pittsburgh skyline 
as the lights go down. Richie, in a 
loose-fitting overcoat, carries his 
guitar case out of the smoke-fillëd 
nightclub in which he has been 
performing and walks the streets 
of the city with a desolate look 
about him.
Soon he makes a turn into 
Forbes from Craig St., and there 
itis,Hamerschlag, shining like a 
golden beacon in the pitchy black.
With a flash of light, Richie is 
levitated to the top of the cupola 
and begins to sing “All Night Long” 
as a slew of engineering profes­
sors wearing Petri dishes for hats 
and using their pointers as canes 
perform a dance routine on the 
Cut.
As Richie reaches a climactic 
crescendo in his performance, 
disco lights and smoke begin to 
emanate from the now rotating 
cupola, and a gargantuan neon 
sign which reads “Carnegie Mel­
lon — The Professional Choice” 
emerges from one of the sub base­
ments of Doherty.
Needless to say, I was shocked. 
But not as shocked as I would
later be when I took up the issue 
with one of my contacts in the 
public relations office. Through 
him I learned that the Board of 
Trustees had just voted to appro­
priate an undisclosed sum of 
money in order to hire Robin 
Williams for a commercial en­
dorsement.
“But everybody knows that 
Robin Williams is a Juilliard 
graduate!” I protested.
“That’s the beauty of it,” he 
replied, and went on to explain 
that the entire ad campaign was 
going to be a Nightmare Vision of 
the Orwellian Hell of being an 
acting student at Juilliard com­
pared to the sheer paradise on
Earth that is the CMU Drai 
Department.
I recently found out that k 
liard has begun negotiations v 
CMU alumni for a series of co: 
mercials in which they wo; 
expose the sordid truth ab: 
dramats working crew on ma 
stage shows during sophom 
year.
I am told that their attempt; 
get Ted Danson have failed n 
erably.
At this point they have o 
been able to contact David L 
der, best known for his perfoi 
ance as “Squiggy,” on Lavernet 
Shirley.
continued on pagt
undisclosed sum of money to 
represent CMU in a series of 
commercials which will air dur­
ing the quiz show College Bowl.”
The pieces of the puzzle were 
now falling together — someone, 
somehow had been siphoning 
money from projects such as the 
Beaux Arts Ball in order to gar­
ner big celebrity endorsements 
for the school.
Particularly disturbing was the 
fact that Lionel graduated from 
Tuskeegee University in Alabama 
and has probably never set foot 
on the CMU campus.
Since I am naturally curious, I 
tuned in to College Bowl (a task 
easier said than done, since the 
only station which shows College 
Bowl nowadays is on the higher

Editor’s note: Private Detective Phillip 
\amnier is a fictious construct of Tartan

pecial to the Tartan
Atlel as 8-9 (p«Cy- 
contestant flexes rippling stomache muscles.
It was a brisk Saturday night in the 
Big Burgh, the sweaty Arm Pitt, the Iron 
City.
Once again, I sat in the smoke-filled 
hang-out known as the Yard. Scotland 
Yard, that is.
I had my assignment, handed down by 
the Tartan Features Editor himself—to 
provide full coverage of the Fourth 
Annual Sexy Body Parts Competition.
Accompanied only by ace pho­
tographer Dan Giurca, I nursed 
my eighth mug of coffee while I 
waited for the competition to 
begin.
Soon, the evening’s hosts 
filed onstage, the beauteous 
Angela Taylor, the ravishing 
Debbie Gibbon, and Oren Adar, 
who, by virtue of being a man 
just isn’t my type.
All three of them were cov­
ered with yards of tight fitting 
taffeta, lace and spandex.
As the event began the crowd 
was as apathetic as a pile of 
sloths in a carpet mill. But 
once the contest began, they 
perked up like a Nerf football 
in the summertime.
The peppy threesome on-regory speaks in Ballroom
stage began to search the audience for 
voulnteers; they even asked me to join in 
the fun. I declined on the thought that 
peddling my pudgy wares before the 
ornery crowd would have compromised 
my journalistic integrity.
Soon they had collected enough con­
testants to begin the night’s events.
The first event was women’s legs, and 
the three contestants in this category 
were the same three who would show up 
at all the other women’s events through 
the suited evening.
The first was a red-headed hot tamale 
with a bod to match the crimson flame 
topping her noggin; number two, a blonde 
bombshell who was most certainly the 
stuff that dreams are made of; and num­
ber three, a body-building beauty, who 
walked off with the prize.
Number three is somewhat of a cam­
pus tradition: she has won this contest 
three times in a row, and I have to say 
that the experience has most certainly 
paid off—the getaway sticks on this plati­
num bathing beauty in the skimpy two- 
piecer made her one of the highlights of 
the evening.
Her prize was a sculpture consisting of 
a cucumber, mushrooms and broccoli 
that can only be described as a cross be­
tween a .44 Magnum and 
the reproductive organs of 
the average Percheron.
The judging of the men’s 
legs followed — and they 
ranged, for the most part 
from scrawny as a free rang­
ing chicken to hairy as a 
Sasquatch.
One particularly Gandhi- 
esque contestant, whom I 
shall refer as to as “Twiggy” 
in the rest of this article, 
charmed the audience with 
the sort of easy going charm 
and finesse that can only be 
attained after extensive 
beer consumption.
In the end it was the 
Sasquatch who won the competition, and 
the head of cabbage that he won as a tro­
phy suited him perfectly.
Buns followed, and to be perfectly 
honest, one started to blend in with the 
other.
If there is something that I can say 
about the women’s buns in this year’s 
competition it is that what little quan­
tity there was was by far outdone by the 
quality.
In truth, I did not see one bun in that

competition that I would not be content 
putting into a toaster oven until golden 
brown.
The women far outshone the men in 
this category, most of the men looked as 
if they had had mashed potatoes dumped 
down their jockey shorts.
Contestant number three took the

In his zeal to show off his loaves he pulled

Mixing comedy and serious

system to keep the bulk of the 
people under control. “The whole 
system went out of their way to 
see to it that once I think you’re 
disrespectful to [your body], I’ll
civil and human rights make you disrespect everything.”
Dick Gregory spoke in 
Skibo Ballroom Saturday.
Gregory implored students to 
ake care of their bodies and their 
piritual health. He encouraged 
¡them to create a positive self- 
image in order to overcome and 
orrect the ills of society.

Jck Gregory speaks to a packed house 
tithe Ballroom on Saturday.
Gregory questioned people’s 
perception of machinery as high- 
tech and their own bodies and 
biology as primitive.
This perception of the body 
causes people to abuse it in the 
name of pleasure and “coolness,” 
and value it less than they do 
material goods.
“I know that if they discovered 
tomorrow that smoking ciga­
rettes in your automobile cor­
rodes your engine ... there 
would be no more smoking in 
the car,” said Gregory.
After quoting a number of 
health statistics of which the 
majority of the crowd was ig­
norant, Gregory emphasized 
the importance, not of educa­
tion, but of information.
If people respected them­
selves and knew the effects of 
their actions upon their 
mental and physical well­
being, conjectured Gregory, 
they would take better care 
of themselves.
Gregory’s case for the im­
portance of free information 
was weakened somewhat by 
several seemingly paranoid
references to what Gregory per­
ceived as political and public 
health conspiracies. He linked 
several of the recent air disasters 
to the CIA, claiming that they 
were faked in order to stir up 
hatred for Arab terrorists.
Gregory repeatedly claimed 
that the government was bring­
ing drugs into the country to 
subjugate people, especially 
blacks.
However, he did include an 
example of the government in­
jecting 600 black men with syphi­
lis in the 1960s and tracking their 
developments over the course of 
twenty years — the idea of which 
woujtd also have been unbeliev­
able in its own time.
During the lecture, Gregory 
repeatedly emphasized that “You 
can make a difference,” and en­
couraged individual change from 
within as the starting point for 
significant social change. Gregory 
also often asked “How long will it 
take?” in an attempt to impress 
upon the audience the swiftness 
with which change needs to take 
place.
Gregory received a standing 
ovation from the crowd for his 
passionate and thought-provok­
ing speech. His appearance was 
sponsored by Spirit and the Po­
litical Speakers Forum Board as 
part of National Black History 
Month.

Couple gets back together
Dear Zazz: When I was 12,1 fell 
in love with a 14-year-old boy. For 
a while , we became “an item.” 
Then the romance fizzled and he 
moved away.
Twenty years later, we’ve met 
again. He’s now 34 and divorced. 
I’m 31 and have never married. 
We’ve been dating again for a 
month, and I’ve already told him 
I love him. He says it’s impossible 
.that I’d be in love after just a 
month. He thinks we need to go 
slower.
Am I in love with the 14-year- 
old from my past or the 34-year- 
old I’m now dating? It feels so 
right with him: I don’t want to 
ruin this.
— SECOND CHANCE
Dear S.C.: It’s entirely possible 
for mature adults to know they’re 
in love after just a month. If he’d 
be more comfortable going slowly, 
oblige him. But you needn’t ques­
tion your feelings.
It’s likely that you love both the 
14-year-oW and the 34-year-old. 
Because you’re familiar with the 
man as a boy, you’ve got a more 
complete picture of him. Who he 
was has helped make him who he 
is. Relax and let the romance take 
its course.
Dear Zazz: I read your column 
about “Sissy,” who asked for your 
advice on a plane trip between 
Phoenix and Chicago. She had 
just left her live-in boyfriend. I 
made a similar trip in 1953. I’d
been living in Texas, to be near 
my boyfriend. But he could never 
make a commitment, so I left him. 
For three days, I rode a Grey­
hound bus back to my parents’ 
home in North Dakota.
My boyfriend wrote to me regu­
larly, said how much he missed 
me, but never proposed. Still, 
when the ground froze over in 
North Dakota, I decided to return 
to him. I had misgivings, but I 
had to do it.
Three more years passed, and 
then a miracle happened. He 
wanted marriage! So prayers do 
get answered. We’ve now been 
married 32 years and have raised 
eight children.
My advice: Never pressure a 
fellow to get married. Get on with 
you life. He’ll look you up if he’s 
honestly in love with you.
— His other half
Dear Zazz: “Sissy” left Phoenix 
without telling Robert, her boy­
friend, that she was leaving him. 
Poor Sissy? Poor Robert!
Was Robert left high and dry 
with the apartment lease and the 
utility bills? Did Sissy also walk
off her job?
Someone should tell Sissy that 
moving in with her boyfriend was 
a commitment in itself. It’s not 
just “playing house” with sex in­
cluded. And if commitment was 
so important to Sissy, why didn’t 
she make him marry her before 
she moved in with him?
How many Roberts will Sissy 
live with before she grows up to 
be a secure and responsible young 
woman?
Living together together before 
marriage is unacceptable and 
wrong. Morality and the family as 
we know it are going down the 
tubes. — E.M.
Dear E.M.: In my opinion, Sissy 
was courageous to leave a troub­
led relationship. She seemed like 
a responsible person to me: I as­
sume she has made arrangements 
regarding the rent and utilities.
Yes, in many ways, the family 
structure is crumbling. But living 
together is not always immoral or 
wrong.
And leaving a bad live-in rela­
tionship is not necessarily irre­
sponsible or a sign of immaturity. 
Often, as in Sissy’s case, I’d call it 
the right move.
I recognize and respect where 
your emotions are coming from. 
Please try to understand why 
Sissy did what she did.

Chicago, IL 60654.CMU begins advertising
riI85I3o, U1iM vCPo '-
Meanwhile, the computer sci­
ence department is said to be 
rushing through the debugging of 
all departmental software in order 
to use the profits of an early sale 
to hire Martha Raye for a series of 
spots in which she will introduce 
herself as “Martha Raye, Andrew 
User.”
The ad campaign is expected to 
bolster the flagging morale of the 
Andrew Project. Apparently the 
computer science department has 
found its fortunes declining ever 
since Rensselaer Polytechnic 
began running their highly vis­
ible Rita Moreno ad campaign.
Not to be outdone, H&SS has 
tried to sell something valuable 
in order to raise the cash needed 
to hire Bruce Willis and Cybill 
Shepherd for a witty, sophisti­
cated advertising campaign.
Unfortunately they have yet to 
find anything valuable to sell.
Where will it all end, and most 
importantly, what will be the price 
that we will have to pay for the
“College Wars?” How long is it
going to be until we have to share 
our campus with countless cam­
era crews herding the likes of 
Cher, Heather Locklear and 
Sheena Easton all about, looking 
for the right spot in which to make 
the school look its best?
Ever since this state of affairs 
came to my attention I have 
wondered if it would have been 
best if I had stayed in the airtight 
collegiate cocoon we are provided 
with here at CMU and forgotten 
that I ever saw this Richie com­
mercial.
But then again, I wonder how I 
would feel if every time I announce 
that I will be a CMU graduate 
everybody responds with a cho­
rus of “Just Like Richie!”
I suppose that I should not 
complain; sharing the campus 
with the likes of Cher, Heather 
Locklear and Sheena Easton does 
not seem like too much of a sacri­
fice to make for a comparison with 
one of America's most beloved 
songwriters.

Specs offers a special 
Valentine’s Day quiz
Love
In lieu of a regular Ask Specs 
column this week, here is a Val­
entine’s Day Quiz.
Please allow yourself 
ample time to consider the 
questions carefully before 
answering.
When you part to go to 
class, do you:
a. wave.
b. give her a peck on the 
cheek.
c. grab her, kiss her 
madly and force a diamond 
and sapphire bracelet on 
her wrist.
You are at a party. Her 
glass is empty. Do you say:
a. “May I get you an­
other beverage?”
b. “There’s a beer wait­
ing for you in the keg out­
side. Get me one while 
you’re there, dude.”
c. “Cry havoc- And let 
slip the dogs of war upon 
the pledge who didn’t keep your 
glass full!”
Since you have discovered 
each other, you’ve been wear­
ing:
a. the same thing you always 
wear.
b. a new aftershave called Get- 
tingChicks.
c. the socks she gave you for 
Christmas (every day), her fa­
vorite color, and a beeper.
When you are alone together 
you usually talk about:
a. the weather, and the sea­
son the Knicks are having.
b. the firm conviction you have 
that she should finish her col­
lege career in Tibet.
c. the loveliness of her nose,
ankles, eyelashes, perfume, front 
tooth, etc.
You just woke up from a nap.
Bleary eyed, your hair is a mess, 
and you can’t find a piece of clean 
laundry. Suddenly, there is a 
knock at the door and it’s her. 
You:
a. Panic - it would be mortifying 
if you were seen in such a state of 
undress. You scream, “Meet me 
at the museum in a half an hour.” 
and then try to pull yourself to­
gether.
b. Tell your romantic interest to 
squeeze some oranges into juice, 
butter two slices of toast and poach 
an egg. You inform her that you 
will open the door in exactly five 
minutes, expecting her to be there 
with the results.
c. Yank open the door and burst 
into tears. It’s been over an hour 
since you two have seen each 
other.
Your idea of an ideal Valen­
tine’s Day date is: 
a. You are not amused by vul 
garity, and therefore don’t cele­
brate the holiday.
b. Send flowers, and 
then take her out for 
dinner. Hopefully, you 
will be able to capture 
the generous feelings she 
has for you when the 
check comes.
c. Take her to Palm 
Springs as a surprise. It 
was her favorite place 
a child, and you want to 
share in all her memo­
ries.
If the majority of the 
answers you chose were 
‘C,’ then you are set for 
life. It’s total, true and 
blissful love.
If the two of you ever 
break up, you can live in 
solitude forever. Content 
at having had something 
so rare, you can marvel at being 
among God’s chosen people.
If‘B’ was your choice more 
often than not, you should re-, 
ally consider yourself lucky to 
have her.
You have an excellent girl 
Friday, (i.e. companion, servant, 
slave, chattel.) Nowadays, good 
help is certainly hard to find.
If you chose ‘A’ most fre> 
quently, you’re calm, mature 
and upwardly-mobile. ‘Frozen’ 
is an adjective often used by 
your romantic interest to de­
scribe you to her friends. You 
can take this as a compliment, 
you’ve earned it. Don’t change 
thing; she is lucky to even know 
you.

inhabited exclusively by men. It 
was not a pretty sight.
One thing this competition con- 
vincedmeofisthefactthatwomen 
invariably have mich nicer un­
derwear than men.
Even though the female winner 
of the best buns category got her 
prize in spite of wearing red gar­
ters and a belt which clashed 
against her black stockings like a 
pack of swingers at a feminist 
convention, the parade of grey- 
ing-white jockey shorts was 
enough to send any self-respect­
ing man running for those 
Garfield Boxers h e got for Christ­
mas.
Once the women’s breasts com­
petition was underway, the crowd 
rose like a pack of revolutionaries 
at a seance for Chi Guevara—as 
for the men’s competition, all that 
I can say is that I only saw a 
bunch of boobs onstage.
In truth, most of themen looked 
like rejects from the underwear 
section of the International Male 
catalog, even Twiggy, but then 
again, maybe that’s a good thing, 
I am obviously not the one to 
judge.
I am after all, a man, some­
thing that my reaction to this 
show has so obviously confirmed. 
I suppose I feel like paraphrasing
Groucho Marx, who once said, “I 
resent any competition where the 
men’s breasts are bigger than the 
women’s.”
By the time the full body com­
petition had ended I was feeling 
about as overloaded as Marlon 
Perkins during a stampede.
After having had raw skin 
thrust in front of me in full 3-D 
cornin’ at ya realism, I felt a little 
bit shell-shocked, or better said, 
flesh-rocked.
Watching the already men­
tioned platinum blonde with the 
three-year record and the gor­
geous gams win the best body 
competition once again, I came to 
the realization that the Sexy Body 
Parts Competition has become 
quite a tradition on this campus, 
and as she and the men with 
whom she had tied for the prize 
spread Hershey’s chocolate all 
over one another I knew that I 
would be back into this smoke- 
filied tavern one year from to­
night.
Everybody who walked out of 
the Yard felt that the free event 
had given them their money’s 
worth.
To all of the valiant men and 
women who chose to bare it all for 
our amusement, there is only one 
thing that can be said-all the very 
breast, er, best.

4 Little Night Music
By STEPHANIE REEDY
j Tartan Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon’s Drama De- 
I partment will open its production 
of Stephen Sondheim’s classic 
musical A Little Night Music for 
previews on Wednesday, Febru­
ary 15 at the Kresge Theatre in 
the CFA building. Previews will 
run for three days, and the show 
will have its official opening on 
j Saturday, February 18 at 8 pm.
A Little Night Music will be 
j directed by Emmy award-winning 
I choreographer Billy Wilson, and 
musically directed by Keith Lock- 
[hart. According to Wilson, the 
) show is a romantic look at “people 
trying to make things work. It’s 
about youth, about middle age, 
and about old age.”
The musical is based upon the 
1957 Ingmar Bergman film 
Smiles of a Summer Night and is 
! set in Sweden in the late 1800’s. It 
follows the romantic escapades of 
j several friends and lovers as they 
I realize their true feelings for each 
1 other over a weekend in the coun­
try. Wilson comments, “I like the 
[ spice of the story — the music is 
I very provocative and complex.” 
CMU’s production of the show 
P promises to be an extravagant 
| affair; it claims one of the more 
I elaborate sets (designed by Dick 
Block) that CMU has used in a 
j production as yet, as well as ele- 
I gant costumes (as many as seven 
each for some of the characters) 
[ designed by Cletus Anderson.
Although not a big song and 
[ dance production, A Little Night 
rMusic will easily capture the 
audience’s attention. According
to junior drama major Mark 
Lewis, who will play Count Carl- 
Magnus Malcom, every song in 
the show is done in waltz tempo. 
“It’s an interesting aspect of the 
show. Billy Wilson has created 
beautiful movement to accompany 
beautiful music. It’s very stylish, 
very elegant, and beautiful to 
watch.”
Billy Wilson is an associate 
professor of musical theatre in 
the Drama Department, and has 
directed such plays as Guys and 
Dolls and Broadway Cabaret in 
his past years at CMU. In addi­
tion to his productions here, 
Wilson created the choreography 
and musical staging for the Broad­
way showsEubie!, Stop the World 
I Want to Get Off, and the 1978 
revival of Guys and Dolls.
Wilson has also choreographed 
ballets for both The Dance The­
atre of Harlem and The Alvin 
Ailey American Dance Theatre, 
and spent last year as choreogra­
pher for the Capitol Ballet in 
Washington, D.C. His next proj­
ect will be directing the musital 
King, based upon the life of Mar­
tin Luther King Jr., which is 
expected to open in London.
Lewis describes Wilson as 
“great to work with — he’s very 
energetic about his work. He has 
ideas that cook constantly, and 
can do something from scratch 
and have it work perfectly.” Lewis 
feels the show will be very enter­
taining and well worth seeing.
A Little Night Music opens 
tomorrow for previews and will 
run until March 4. For informa­
tion call the box office at 268- 
2407.
PBTs Great Gatsby loses something in the translation
I; By LORI MAURER
| Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
There have been a few attempts 
| to bring the power of F. Scott Fitz- 
igerald’s novel,The Great Gatsby, 
I to another art form, most of which 
l have been unsuccessful. The Pitts- 
Iburgh Ballet Theatre, in a pro- 
Iduction that ran at the Benedum 
|Center' from February 9-12,
attempted to bring Fitzgerald’s 
jazz era angst to the stage and 
met a similar fate.
Although the Pittsburgh Ballet 
Theatre should be commended for 
the dazzling one hundred and 
twenty different costumes, nine 
sets, and the superb dancing in 
its production of The Great Gatsby, 
the difficulty of translating Fitz­
gerald’s intricate prose into an
equally noteworthyjaallet would 
have been too difficult for any 
ballet company.
The ballet, with the present 
libretto and choreography by 
Andre Prokovsky, is baffling to 
those not familiar with the novel. 
The constant shift from party 
scene to party scene just becomes 
tiresome after a few repetitions, 
especially in the second act.
The GreatGatsby sold outin its 
1987 world premiere at the 
Benedum Center and the com­
pany is taking it on tour this year. 
Although there are a few stirring 
moments, such as the pas de deux 
between Jennifer Davis as Myrtle 
and Brian Bloomquist as Tom 
Buchanan, the ballet was more 
impressive in its superficial quali­
ties than in the rendering of the
story or in the quality of the cho­
reography. The ballet was suc­
cessful in depicting the material­
ism that Fitzgerald condemns in 
his novel but it doesn’t offer a 
substitute for the powerful prose 
that makes the novel such a great 
work. At the end of the ballet, the 
sense of loss inherent in the novel 
is apparent but even greater is 
the sense of relief that the dance
of little substance is over.
The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre 
may call this their “signature 
ballet” but I don’t think that The 
Great Gatsby gives the company 
an adequate opportunity to dis­
play its flawless skill and exper­
tise in dance.
The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre 
will take The Great Gatsby on 
tour through April 1st.

5 STUDY SKILLS TUTORS NEEDED
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Staffwriter
For those of you who were 
around here last year, a question. 
What was one of the biggest AB 
events that rocked the Skibo Ball­
room last February?
If you an- ______________
swered George 
Gee and His 
Make-Believe 
Ballroom Or­
chèstra, then you 
were right. And 
guess what? The 
CMU alumnus 
and his big band 
are coming back 
to swing in the 
bàllroom again
this Saturday _______________
night at 10 pm.
For those of 
you who were not here last year 
(or were unfortunate and did not 
attend the show), I’ll fill you in on 
hife background and his sounds.
George Gee and His Make-Be-

was then that George, a sopho­

forms more than 150 times a year 
all over the country.
But, you say, aballroom orches­

Last year’s show was rumored 
to have an attendance larger th an 
any other AB dancehas ever had.
“You see the one thing about 
our show ... like if you’re not a 
dancer, first of all everyone is a 
dancer. Because anyone can move 
to a beat. And with my music 111

great. But the 
thing is that just 
go out there and 
boogie.”
“I’ve seen 
people do the ba- 
toosie to us, you 
know what I 
mean? That 
little dance that 
Batman did? Or 
was it Catwoman? Themainthing 
is that we are a show.”
And boy, does George have a 
show. In just a half-hour with 
him you can see the energy, the 
excitement and charisma he has.
Last year’s show proved just 
how energetically George bounced 
and bopped up on the stage. “I’m 
a mover. I’m a mellow cat right 
now, but when I get in front of my 
band I become a different type of 
person. I become the ultimate hip­
ster.”
“We don’t just sit on our butts 
and read the music. Big band 
music is not just about sitting and
a show. You can enjoy the music 
visually and acoustically. The 
music is a very expressive type 
thing.”
George and the band are ex­
tremely excited to be playing at 
CMU this year. Not only is George 
a CMU alumnus but so are half 
the members of his band. This 
show is a very special one for 
them.
So this Saturday at 10 pm come 
on down and check out the swing­
ing sounds of George and his or­
chestra. If last year’s incredible 
showhasn’t persuaded you yet, or 
even if this article hasn’t, then 
maybe George can.
“You might have had a fight 
with your girlfriend right before­
hand, or you might have failed a 
big midterm, but when you come 
into the Make-Believe Ballroom 
— you forget all about that shit, 
man.”
George Gee and his Make-Be­
lieve Ballroom Orchestra will take 
you downtown this Saturday 
night, so slide on down and check 
it out.
Says Gee, “I just love to have 
fun, you know, fun. A simple 
three letter word.”George Gee keeps his cool on a hot swing night.xC18CI U5ao vni8i
But even with the odds against 
him George’s band blew the door 
off the Skibo Ballroom. “It was

it was soooo cold. And before we

I typed “Creative problem 
solver.”
You’ve probly heard me talking 
about my cousin Cletis Coverdale. 
who lives in Waxahachie, Texas, 
but never has been able to find a 
job for the last 12 years and so 
he’s gonna take a crack at the 
Superconducting Supercol­
lider that’s supposed to 
create 17 million jobs in a 
giant tunnel under 
Waxahachie. Cletis came 
by last week, cause he heard 
1 knew how to type and he 
ieeded to “update” his res­
ume.
So I asked him what kind 
of job he was looking for.
“Hunnerd a week and get off 
weekends.”
See, once you’ve got yourself a 
clearly defined goal like that, then 
you’re well on the way to being an 
employed individual. So up at the 
top of Cletis’s resume, I put 
‘Career Objective: Detail-oriented 
self-starter with bottom-line 
savvy seeks entry-level trainee 
position in stable firm with growth 
potential.”
Next thing, I asked Cletis what 
kind of education he had.
“I worked on my brother’s 
truck.”
I type “Heavy equipment tech­
nology background.”
“By the way, whatever hap­
pened to that truck after you
Cletis reminded me he had three 
hours credit from 1968 when he 
went to the Big Rig Truck Driving 
School over in Shreveport, but I 
told him we couldn’t write that 
down because he never did gradu­
ate. “You should never put mis­
leading information on your res­
ume,” I said.
Next thing, we got into Cletis’s 
employment history. It was fine 
up until 1976. Cletis hauled dirt 
for Scrim Wilks, took inventory 
at the Gulf station, and unloaded 
Christmas trees off railroad cars 
for the Elks Club. But ever since 
then, Cletis has just been sitting 
around the barber shop for most 
of the last 12 years. So at the end 
of the employment history, I 
wrote, “Due to the depressed econ­
omy, Mr. Coverdale’s position was 
eliminated.”
Under “Personal,” I typed 
Divorced, Smoker, Skinny as a 
rail,” but Cletis took exception to 
that. “I ain’t divorced,” he said. “I 
ain’t SEEN her in seven 
J years, but we never did 
m put the papers through.”
I got out the eraser and 
changed it to “Involved, 
e Sort of, No dependents,
0 Actually you wouldn’t be­
lieve it.”
“All right, Cletis, now 
we’re at the point where 
every great resume has to deliver 
the groceries. What are your spe­
cific skills for this job?”
“What job?” Cletis said. 
“Running the Superconducting 
Supercollider.”
“I’m a people person.” 
“GREAT! You’ve gotta be a 
people person for this. Very good.” 
“I’m a take-charge self-starter.” 
“We already said that.”
“By the way, I don’t smoke.” 
“Right.”
“I chew.”
“Okay, but Cletis, what’s the 
one skill that sort of sums up your 
ability to manage the world’s 
largest atomic collider? We’ve 
gotta put that on here.”
“I can type twenty words a 
minute with two mistakes.”
Night Music captures critic
The two or three people that 
readmy column on aregular basis 
(not including my mother) might 
wonder why aperpetual critic like 
myself has only written previews 
in the last three weeks. Well, it 
disturbsme too, because it means 
lhaven’tbeen to see much of any­
thing since break. Work­
ing on the Drama Depart­
ment production, A Little 
Night Music (Kresge Thea­
ter - February 15 through 
March 4), has meant com­
mitting almost every night 
to the project. Once the 
show opens life will hopefully 
improve and I can redevelop my 
'critical skills.”
Once again, the new week 
jrings several musical events that 
[ wish I could attend. First on the 
iist is a concert in the Music De­
partment’s new Faculty Recital 
Series. This one features the 
works of 20th century composer 
George Crumb and takes place at 
pm, Tuesday in the Mellon In­
stitute auditorium. The perform­
ers include Julio Lazarte, piano, 
Marielena Arizpe, flute, and Al­
varo Bitran, cello.
A concert sponsored by the 
Renaissance and Baroque Soci­
ety of Pittsburgh on Saturday will
present a radical contrast to the 
Crumb concert with music of 
Lully, Marais, and Handel. The 
performers for the concert are the 
Baroque ensemble “Music’s Rec­
reation” and New York Baroque 
Dance Ensemble soloist Cather­
ine Turocy. The music and dance
will be performed in period style 
with original instruments, masks 
and costumes and the evening 
promises to be a interesting one 
in musical and theatrical senses. 
The concert begins at 8 pm at 
Synod Hall (behind St. Paul’s 
Cathedral) in Oakland. For tick­
ets call 682-7262.
The Pittsburgh Symphony 
plays a set ofthree concerts Thurs­
day (8 pm), Friday (8:30 pm), and 
Saturday (8 pm) under the Baton 
of music director Lorin Maazel. 
This past weekend’s concerts with 
Maazel and flutist Jean-Pierre

“I can use a Dictaphone. I can’t 
type out what’s on it, but I can use 
it.”
“Also good, but it doesn’t really 
sum it up.”
“I have management consult­
ant experience in the field.” 
“Bingo!”
“I should of told you that to 
start with. I used to run a fork lift 
for Rusty Cheever.”
“Was the fork lift made up of 
atomic particles?”
“I reckon. I didn’t ask Rusty.” 
“You’re in.”
I typed in “Customer Service 
Hardware Systems Management 
Experience.” The rest of you 
people out there might as well not 
even apply.
Speaking of people taking up 
space at the pool hall, “Shame” is 
a new flick about a motorcyclist 
who rides into a small town, finds 
out some creepolas are raping the 
high school girls, and starts kick­
ing hiney. Usually, you put this 
Charles Bronson plot on the big 
screen, and Ebert and Siskel can’t
wait to get their claws in it. Writ­
ers for the New York Slimes stand 
in line to call it the most disgust­
ing movie in history. (Notice what 
they been saying about “Kinjite.”) 
This one, though, gets shown at 
film festivals and always gets 
great reviews. What’s the rea­
son? They made it over in Austra­
lia, and the motorcyclist Bron­
son-type is a woman.
Yeah. Right.
Fortunately, I have no male- 
female prejudice and so I recog­
nize a great revenge movie no 
matter who’s bashing heads. 
Deborra-Lee Furness is the gal 
who rides into one of those little 
dusty grease spots in Western 
Australia, gets hassled in the pub, 
hangs around two days waiting 
for spare parts for her bike, and 
ends up discovering the ultimate 
small-town secret: the local sport 
is recreational rape. Whenever 
anybody complains, the sheriff 
just says it’s boys “having a little 
fun” and “doing what nature in­
tended.” And when one of the 
rapees down at the meatworks — 
not making this up — decides to
complain, they laugh her out of 
town as whiner. But then they 
make the mistake of messing with - 
Deborra-Lee.
No breasts. (Feminism.) One 
dead body. Two motor vehicle 
chases. Wimp-punching. 
Drunken frenzy. Grandma-beat- 
ing. 174 construction-worker 
remarks, some of em fairly funny. 
Two giant wheelies. Twenty uses 
of the word “slut.” Kung Fu. Fist 
Fu. Brick-through-the windshield 
Fu. Wheelie Fu. Blowtorch Fu.. 
Spray-paint Fu. Graffiti Fu. Ju­
venile delinquent Fu. Drive-In 
Academy Award nominations for 
Deborra-Lee Furness, as the 
Australian feminist Chuck Bron­
son; Peter Aanensen, as the 
scummy local cop, for saying. 
“Well, I hope you’re bloody satis- . 
fied!”; and Beverly Blankenship 
and Michael Brindly, the writers,v 
for the line “My family is not going 
to be dragged through the mud 
because of some little ... factory 
girl!”
Four stars. Joe Bob says check 
it out.
American composer Samuel Bar­
ber (Overture to The School for 
Scandal, Adagio for Strings, and 
the Violin Concerto) are paired 
with the Prokofiev Symphony No.
5 in a program featuring concert- 
master Andres Cardenes as solo­
ist in the Barber Concerto. Of the 
Barber works, the Adagio 
is familiar to many through 
its app earance in the sound­
track to the movie Platoon. 
The Prokofiev Symphony 
No. 5 is less familiar to 
general audiences but 
speaks just as powerfully. 
Prokofiev himself stated at the 
time of the work’s first perform­
ance (1945) that the work was 
intended as “a hymn to free and 
happy Man, to his mighty pow­
ers, his pure and noble spirit,” 
and the work speaks in that same 
spirit. For tickets call 392-4900.
One final event of interest to 
readers is the appearance of local 
music critic Robert Croane on the 
Music Department’s Career 
Seminar Series. Croane will speak 
on the Thursday convocation 
program at 12:30 pm in Alumni 
Concert Hall, CFA. The lecture is 
free and open to any interested 
members of the campus commu­
nity.

isn’t it? When the weather is like

The Hidden. This movie 
op$ns with a violent bank 
robbery followed by a break­
neck car chase scene. If you 
think that you’re in for an- 
. other routine cop movie, keep 
“watching. The funny look in the 
thiefs eyes and the way he ap­
pears blissfully unconcerned 
about the pursuing cops tells you 
th&t this guy is not quite all there.
As the chase continues the thief 
nonchalantly kills a few people 
here and there, gets riddled with 
a few dozen bullets, and crashes 
his car through a police blockade, 
^aughing all the way through. He 
' is later rushed to a hospital, mi­
raculously still alive.
Back at police headquarters, 
Tom Beck (Kyle MacLachlan) is 
the cop assigned to the case. The 
robber was a man who, until a few 
days before, was an average law- 
abiding citizen. Beck can’t figure 
out why such a man would sud­
denly start such an incredible 
string of violent crimes.
Soon detective Lloyd Gallagher 
(Michael Nouri) appears on the 
scene. Gallagher is a visiting FBI
- agent who assigns himself to the 
case. As the movie progresses 
B$ck figures out the key to this 
mystery about half an hour after 
we’ve figured it out for ourselves. 
Both the killer and the so-called 
FBI agent are aliens.
_ Gallagher is an Altarian who 
! has been trying to capture a vi­
cious renegade alien who killed
his partner and family on another 
planet. The creature ca^. change 
identities by moving from one host 
body to another through the 
mouth. Once ingested, it takes 
over the host’s body and basically 
kills a lot of people. The only time 
that it is vulnerable is the few sec­
onds while it movfe? 
bodies.
This movie is surprisingly origi­
nal and quite an effective thriller. 
The viewer even gets a Chance to 
see Gallagher’s “huiriaii” quali­
ties when he meets Beck’s wife 
and daughter. All in all the psy­
cho alien kills around 37 people, 
robs six banks, two liquor*.'stores, 
a record shop, steals twoFerraris, 
takes over a police station, and 
takes, a guided tour of 6arth life- 
forms. This is perhaps the most 
relentless SF action film I have 
seen since The Terminator.
As for the next movie, let me 
ask you how often you have been 
through this situation. One beau­
tiful spring day in lowe^.Manhat- 
tan you are having your lunch 
break and decide not to pay the 
bill just for the hell of it. Your 
small act goes unnoticed by the 
cashier, but not by another per­
son. An eccentrically dressed 
young woman who calls herself 
Lulu confronts you on the street 
and threatens to call the police, 
but instead offers you a ride back 
to the office. The next thing you 
know, you’re somewhere in New 
Jersey, in a sleazy motel room, 
handcuffed to the bedpost, hav­
ing the phone held up to your
mouth so you can lie to your boss 
while having sex at the same time.
You say that you have not en­
countered this before? Well, 
Charlie Driggs (Jeff Daniels) does 
in the movie Something Wild. As 
the title suggests, that is exactly 
what this movie is.
The reckless Lulu (who is 
actually named Audrey 
Hankel) is played by Melanie 
Griffith. The movie was di­
rected by Johnathan Demme 
who is also responsible for 
the offbeat comedies Married 
to the Mob, Handle With Care 
and Melvin and Howard as 
well as the all-time greatest 
concert film Stop Making 
Sense.
Once they’ve finished their toss­
ing around in the motel room, the 
odd couple drive on down to Tal­
lahassee to meet Audrey’s mother, 
pretending to be husband and 
wife, and attend her high school 
reunion. At the reunion Audrey 
runs into the last person in the 
world she wants to see, her hus­
band (Ray Liotta), who is fresh 
out of prison. He follows them, 
takes them captive, and forces 
them to join him on a crime spree.
Something Wild is quite a 
movie. Demme has the gift of 
.finding the bizarre in the ordi­
nary. Liotta, as Ray Sinclair, 
Audrey’s insane evil husband, is 
superb. A perfect way to sum up 
this movie is by mentioning the 
cameo appearance of John Wa­
ters. If he’s in this movie, you 
should know what you’re in for.
Finally, new in the video stores 
are Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, 
The Gopd Mother, and Caddy- 
shack II. If you have a favorite 
movie that you would like to rec­
ommend to me, you can send me 
e-mail (sg20@andrew) or send 
campus mail to the Tartan, Box

This month the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse Dance Theatre will 
present a production entitled 
Dance For The New Age. Fea­
tured will be five dance pieces 
by resident artists and one 
premiere work by guest chore- 
I ographer Howard Richard.
Mr. Richard is a Montreal 
native, and head of his own 
company, Howard Richard 
Danse. His choreographic cred­
its include La Femme aux Tal­
ons Hauts for Les Ballets Jazz 
de Montreal and Cast dance to 
an Indigo Night for Louise 
Latreille of Pointepienu Dance 
Company. His new ballet, 
entitled Signs Of Life, involves 
weighted and sophisticated 
movements that envelop the 
stage in patterns that form and
dissolve.
Douglas Bentz, the Production 
Coordinator for the Dance The­
atre, offers his new, contempo­
rary jazz work American Scene 
Magazine. The dance takes a 
slightly irreverent look at mod­
ern American society, accompa­
nied by a score composed entirely 
of dialogue from television soaps 
and commercials.
Tome Cousin’s Spell is based on 
a children’s fable in East Indian 
and Haitian folklore. It centers 
around a children’s game of dare 
that ends uphavingthe loser enter 
the forbidden Petrified Forest, 
where his playmates follow and 
fall under the spell.
Way of Blood, Path of Spirit is a 
piece by Ronald Hutson. It re­
flects upon the African and Afri­
can-American experience, exam­
ining folkways and culture as 
surviving mechanisms that fol­
low a people. Through move­
ment, the influence of African 
religious beliefs, modified by 
Western culture, is revealed as 
a contributing influence to Af­
rican inspired art.
Outside Voices, choreo­
graphed by Judith Leifer, is a 
modem work concerned with 
reticence in making decisions. 
It deals with listening to voices 
that can force us into non-ac- 
tion and the process of clearing 
out those voices thatpreventus 
from making a first move. The 
piece is set to the music of 
George Crumb.
Dance For The New Age will 
be at the Pittsburgh Playhouse 
February 16-19. Performances 
will be at 8 pm, with Sunday’s 
performance at 2 pm. Tickets 
range from $6.00 to $10.00. For 
further information call the 
Playhouse at (412) 621-4445.

Thursday, February 16 She’s Gotta Have It
A low-budget feature filmed by Spike Lee, the 
title tells it like it is. Nola Darling is a nymphoma- 
, niacal young black woman who wants it any way she 
can get it. She has three male lovers and a bunch of 
female friends as well. Nola, her male lovers and her 
female friends all compete with the camera to tell us 
just who Nola Darling is. This is Lee’s answer to the 
misconception that it’s alright for the guys to do 
whatever they want but the gals are supposed to 
keep themselves pure and innocent. If you don’t have 
to get up early on Friday, this one just may be worth

adds a new dimension to her career playing comedy 
instead of her usual dramatic roles, while Hanks 
tones down his usual “funny guy” image and concen­
trates on the stand-up routines. Many feel that 
Hanks’ talents were wasted on this film. Go and 
decide for yourself.

Sunday, February 19 Rebel Without A Cause
Starring James Dean and Natalie Wood, this is 
the film that made Dean a teen idol and a legend. 
More than any other film, this classic sympathizes 
with youths who have complex problems. The char­
acters are kids who come from broken homes. Each 
has been arrested for some form of juvenile delin­
quency —their lives are intertwined through triumph 
and tragedy. It’s a classic “bad youth” film that still 
touches home today.

Public TV shows soul, jazz, and Dylan
By MICHAEL SCHWARTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
The people at WQEX/16 have 
got some spectacular musical 
programming lined up for your 
viewing entertainment. Starting 
tomorrow, February 15, the sta­
tion will broadcast a total of six 
musical specials throughout the 
next week.
Starting things off will be Walk­
ing to New Orleans, Wednesday 
night at 9 pm. The show stars 
Jools Holland, keyboard player 
for the rock band Squeeze. As the 
show begins, Holland is in Lon­
don, dreaming of the sweetjazz of 
New Orleans. He walks through 
a tunnel, past a rather unusual 
street musician (it happens to be 
Sting, singing “A New Moon Over 
Bourbon Street”) and exits the 
tunnel in south Louisiana—about 
300 miles from his goal of New 
Orleans. For the next seven days 
(compressed into an hour), he 
makes his way closer to the jazz 
capital, not walking but driving a 
battered Oldsmobile. As he drives 
toward the city, he runs into leg­
endary jazz musicians such as 
Fats Domino, Johnnie Allen and 
The Neville Brothers.
The beloved folk trio Peter, Paul 
and Mary celebrate their 25th 
year together in a special 90- 
minute concert airing on Sunday 
at 8 pm. The trio sing many of 
their classic songs, including Bob 
Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind”; 
John Denver’s “Jet Plane”; Pete 
Seeger’s “If I had a Hammer” and 
“Where Have All the Flowers 
Gone.” Peter Yarrow, Noel Paul 
Stookey and Mary Travers began 
their association in the early ’60s. 
Since that time, they have ac­
tively supported peace, civil and 
human rights, ecology and other 
causes. They were among the 
artists who took part in the Live 
Aid concert in support of famine 
relief efforts in Ethiopia. With 
eight gold records and five plati­
num records, they are the most 
successful folk music trio in the 
history of popular music.
Bob Dylan is the focus of a spe­
cial entitled Don’t Look Back, 
airing Sunday at 10 pm. Filmed 
in 1965, Don’t Look Back depicts
24-year old Dylan’s reaction to 
overnight stardom. There are 
moments of tension as he loses 
his temper and makes shocking 
remarks to a magazine reporter. 
Releases in 1967, the film was re- 
released in 1982 after being kept 
out of distribution by Dylan, who 
held the rights to the film.
Get ready to rock with the 
Temptations on Tuesday night at
8 pm. Otis Williams, Melvin Fran­
klin, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Wil­
liams and Elbridge Bryant begin 
theirrise to stardom in 1961when 
the group first cut two singles for
Miracle Records. They perform 
hits such as “My Girl,” “Just My 
Imagination,” “Papa Was A Roll­
ing Stone,” and ‘The Way You Do 
The Things You Do.”
Later that same night at 9 pm, 
stay tuned for Don’t Knock The 
Rock, a celebration of the birth of 
rock’n’roll and television. The 
show will include performances 
like “Be Bop A Lula” by Gene 
Vincent, “Whole Lotta Shakin” 
and “Great Balls of Fire” by Jerry 
Lee Lewis, and “Long Tall Sally,” 
“Lucille,” and “Good Golly Miss 
Molly” by Little Richard.
“And now for something com­
pletely different,” John Cleese, 
the man you all know and love 
from “Monty Python’s Flying
Circus,” will starin a special aired 
Wednesday, February 22 at 9 pm 
Cleese speaks candidly with host 
Melvin Bragg of his career in 
comedy performance, the origins 
of his humor and characters and 
how his recent psychotherapy 
altered the direction of his work. 
Clips from “Monty Python” will 
be highlighted, but more than a 
showcase of “Python” sketches, 
the special traces Cleese’s career 
from the days of the Footlights 
Club, a comedy troupe which he 
performed with while attending 
Cambridge University. It’s a 
closer look at Cleese, the man 
who believes in an ideal world 
there would be “nothing that you 
couldn’t be funny about.”
City Theatre presents rock “concertplay”
PITTSBURGH — City Theatre 
is currently presenting the East 
Coast premiere of Steven Dietz’s 
unique rock “concertplay,” Paint­
ing it Red, the third offering of the 
1988-89 season. Dietz directs the 
production which opened on Janu­
ary 25 and runs through Febru­
ary 19.
Painting it Red is an unusual 
combination of live rock concert, 
sophisticated romantic comedy, 
and searing, insightful commen­
tary on the state of modern rela­
tionships. The electric rhythms 
of an onstage rock band serve to 
punctuate the story of Liz who, 
after the breakup of a three-year 
romance, finds herself suddenly 
and unwillingly thrust into the 
painful and confusing singles 
scenes of the’80s. The play weaves 
back and forth between hard-driv­
ing rock songs and the offbeat, 
endearing characters that popu­
late Liz’s life as she works through 
the process of healing her broken
heart.
Steven Dietz has worked as a 
playwright and director in Min­
neapolis for eight years. His plays 
God’s Country, Ten November, 
Foolin’ Around With Infinity, 
More Fun Than Bowling, Burn­
ing Desire, Wanderlust , and 
Random Acts have been seen at 
such theatres as the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center, Wisdom Bridge 
Theatre, Berkeley Repertory 
Theatre, A Contemporary The­
atre and Pennsylvania Stage 
Company.
Dietz directed the world pre­
miere of Kevin Kling’s 21A for 
Quicksilver Stage — a theatre he 
co-founded in Minneapolis. He 
also directed the premiere pro­
ductions of Jon Klein’s T Bone n’ 
Weasel and John Olive’s Voice of 
the Prairie. His most recent writ­
ing includes Happenstance, which 
he directed at the Guthrie Lab in 
Minneapolis. Dietz’s writings 
about the theatre have appeared
in American Theatre Magazine, 
Callboard, Subtext, and the Los 
Angeles Times.
Painting it Red is the result o£a 
collaboration between Dietz and 
members of the Twin Cities, rock 
group Rue Nouveau. Dietz vyrote 
the script, composer Gary Rue 
wrote the music and singer/lyri­
cist/actress Leslie Ball wrote the 
lyrics and played the central role 
of Liz. The play was given wqrk- 
shop production at the Actor's 
Theatre of St. Paul after which it 
was given full productions, at 
Quicksilver Stage Company çind 
Berkeley Repertory Theater. In 
City Theatre’s production Leslie 
Ball will reprise her critically 
acclaimed role of Liz.
Curtain time for Painting it Red, 
is 8 pm Wednesday, Thursday 
and Friday, 6 and 9 pm Saturday, 
and a 2 pm matinee on Sunday. 
For ticket information call the 
City Theatre Box Office at (4.12)
