Support Your College Papers!
Purchase Them! Contribute!
Give your campus publication a 
big hand. They need it and de­
serve it. They are worth while 
the life of the school and in 
projects which fill a definite place’ 
your life. You can help make’ this 
school a finer school and enrich: 
your own life by supporting,; 
through patronization and contri-j 
bution, these publications.
Have you ordered a Thistle? Doj 
you buy the Puppet? Have you a1 
Student Directory?^ Do you rcaaj 
the Tartan? No? Yes? No? Ifi 
not, why not? Was the cost too 
much? Is the publication un-j 
worthy? Do you borrow youn 
neighbor’s? Aren’t you interested?! 
But of course you are interested,; 
in an apathetic sort of way. You; 
are interested to the extent of de­
siring to know what is what and 
who is who, but if you don’t find 
out, why, nothing will happen. No, 
but something might happen if you 
did. If every one of you purchas-' 
ed a Thistle, the price would be a 
great deal lower. If every one of 
you bought a Puppet, the maga­
zine would be able to expand into; 
a publication to which Carnegians 
could point with justifiable pride. 
If every one of you would care­
fully read the Tartan, you -wouldn’t
say the day after: "Oh, I thought 
he was to lecture tonight,” or try 
to secure tickets for Little Thea­
ter plays a week after the play 
has gone off the boards. And if 
every one of you used a Student 
Directory, it’s price could be re­
duced and its mprc frequent re­
vision would be possible.
Why should you buy and read 
all these publications? What good 
are they to you? Think of }rour 
high school annuals. You take 
them out and read them over 
every now and then with’ a great 
deal of pleasure, and when you 
meet old friends or make new 
ones, you look them up in the “an­
nual” just to "place them.” In 
years to come your college year­
book will prove even more valued 
for the same reasons. As for Pup 
pet, it is an expression of local 
gossip, and wit and humor, and 
national college spirit that pro­
vokes many a chuckle and is re­
sponsible for much good college 
fellowship. The Tartan and the 
Student Directory speak for them­
selves: The one is the necessary
vehicle for spreading news and 
making important announcements. 
Without it the college would be

there comes the announcement* that 
the Newman Club of Pittsburgh 
will hold its annual summer in­
formal dance on that date. For

Culver H. Smith 
To Make Study 
Of U. S. Press
Will Prepare a Guide to 
Opinion Forming 
Newspapers
Culver H. Smith, instructor in 
Industrial History, has been se­
lected by the International Com­
mittee of Historical Science, work­
ing in co-operation with the Amer­
ican Council, of Learned Societies, 
to prepare “A Guide to the Opin­
ion Forming Press of the United 
States.”
The work will list those daily 
and weekly newspapers which, in 
Mr. Smith’s opinion, have been 
instrumental in forming and in­
fluencing public opinion. With each 
newspaper which he lists, he will 
give essential information concern­
ing political tendencies of the 
paper, stands and policies of the 
paper on various matters of public 
interest throughout the paper's 
existence, the extent of the terri­
tory influnccd by the paper, a brief 
history of the paper designed to 
show the origin of its policies, and 
the location of the most complete 
files of the paper.
Mr. Smith's work is expected to 
prove especially valuable to stu­
dents; and foreign students in par­
ticular, who arc doing research 
work and desire to know or to 
study the opinions and state of 
mind of Americans at any period. 
His list will facilitate the work of 
the student for it will directfhim 
to those publications which will 
be of most value to him and, • in 
addition, will indicate where, the 
most complete files of . the news­
paper may be found.
Mr. Smith’s work is part of a 
project which is international in 
scope and while he is preparing 
the American section, others will 
be at work in foreign countries 
making a similar study of the press 
in each country. The reports will

Thistles Delayed, Will 
Be Issued This Week 
At Y. M. C. A. Office
The Thistles were not issued in 
the “Y” 9ffice yesterday due to 
slight changes that caused some of 
the copy to arrive late at the print­
ing plant. It is expected , that the 
books will be out some time this 
week. When the books arrive' the 
students will be informed by 
notices that will be placed on the 
bulletin boards.
The students will no longer be 
approached by salesmen this year 
as all order books were turned in 
last week. The amount of sales 
shows a remarkable increase over 
former years, thus proving that the 
students arc really beginning to 
take advantage of the hard and ex­
pensive work that the staff does 
for the benefit of the school. The 
great number of orders taken by 
the individual salesmen made the 
competition for business offices 
close. The freshmen salesmen 
made a remarkable record for the 
short period in which they were 
allowed to sell.
Although the students will not 
be able to purchase books from 
salesmen, they still have time to 
turn their orders in at the “Y” 
office.
At the last meeting of the stu­
dent. council, a recommendation 
that the future Thistles be paid 
for by a change in the activities 
fee, was approved. If this recom­
mendation is approved by the Exe­
cutive Board, in future years each 
student will rcceive a copy upon 
publication.
Caps And Gowns

Cap and gown orders will be 
taken at the Y. M. C. A. office 
for Industries, Engineering and 
Arts schools Wednesday, Thursday

lege between 11:30 and 1:30 on the 
same days. Margaret Morrison 
students will rcceive their gowns 
Friday afternoon, May 15, at the 
Y. M. C. A. office between 2 and 5. 
Industries, Engineering and Arts 
students will rcceive theirs June 
4 and 5 at the same place. The 
Margaret Morrison students re­

ALUMNI MEMBERSHIP 
DRIVE STARTS TODAY 
FOR GRADUATING CLASS
Special Rate Offered to 
Seniors If Paid By 
June 9
Following a meeting held last 
evening, attended by more than 
fifty senior class agents from the 
four colleges and representatives of 
the Carnegie. Alumni Federation, 
the senior alumni membership cam­
paign was launched on the Cam­
pus this morning.
Representatives from each de­
partment of the four colleges are 
soliciting members from their own 
departments for the purpose , of 
interesting each 1931 graduate in 
membership in the alumni associa­
tion before commencement, June 9. 
It is the aim of this year’s group 
of senior representatives 'to have 
the largest senior-'alumni member­
ship on record. One hundred per 
cent membership is the goal of all 
departments. In order .that the 
seniors maybe constantly informed 
of the progress of the campaign, a 
bulletin board showing indicators 
for the four colleges will be erected 
on the-porch of the campus library, 
and the percentage of paid-up mem­
bership marked on it from day to 
day. Competition among the four 
colleges will be most interesting. 
It is customary on the majority of 
college campus for the seniors to 
become members of the alumni 
association before their graduation, 
and in this way to indicate their 
continued interest in their Alma 
Mater.
In accordance with the campaigns^ 
for senior-alumni membership held 
in the past two years, a special 
rate for alumni membership is

PAGE T.WOTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MAY 12, 1931.
SPORTS AND ALUMNI NEWS
CARNEGIE’S TRACK AND FIELD STARS had very lit­
tle in common with their Presidential opponents of last Wed­
nesday. All first places belonged to the Plaid team with the ex­ception of, a partnership in the broad jump. ¦ A decisive 104 to 
30 victory is reason enough to believe that the present squad 
stands a fair chance of completing the season without a single defeat. The healthy score inflicted upon the W. and J. athletes 
is the largest of recent years, and is not entirely due to the poor 
showing of the Prexys.
Last week’s entry into the record book was made by John 
Karcis in the discus. His heave of 133 feet surpasses an eight- 
year-old record by about six feet.Jesse Price, ex-cross-country captain, put on a fast show for 
the Little Washingtonians in his two-mile run. His less speedy opponents, which he lapped in the latter part of the race, failed 
in their attempt to box the diminutive Skibo runner. As in previous races, Jesse proved that his boxing ability on the track 
is on a par with his winning stride.In all probability Ras Ramsey had someone waiting for 
him in the mile run, for he hurried home with the fast time of 
4:42.2. Glenn Smith, W. and J. satellite with an assortment of tricks, took the high point honors in a scries of four events.
* * * * ' *
COACH HALFERTY’S CHARGES will meet a severe test in the Geneva athletes who put in an appearance in the Bowl 
on Saturday. Among the visitors’ luminaries is Howard 
Spencer, who totes a high jump record of 6 feet 1 % inches. 
Plebe trackers will have little trouble in 'downing the Peabody
team this afternoon, and are also clue to take the honors fromShadyside next Friday on the opponent’s, field.
* * * * *
FRESHMEN ATHLETES received their first set-back of 
the season from the strong Kiski track team by a shallow mar­
gin of 12 points. Many of the events ended with a neck and neck finish, the half mile and hurdles being the big thrillers.
:« * * * *
THE VARSITY TENNIS' TEAM chalked up two more matches for their credit in the past week by defeating W. and J. and Duquesne. Bergahnc, McCloskcy and Gesling were the 
big guns against the Prexys. The latter two copped the final 
doubles match which gave the decision.Andy Smeaton, captain of the Dukes, won his last of a 
series of 16 contests by defeating Stew Dueger, lead-off man on the Skibo squad. Eddie Jacobs, Pitt captain, easily ended 
the winning streak last week in the match with Duquesne.If the court teams have a chance to play on Monday there 
is bound to be one in favor of. the Pitt aggregation, for the 
Panthers carry with them such ammunition that has defeated 
a national champion, Johnny Doeg.Coach Hoover’s dope on his seven ranking players has been 
greatly diluted during the past week. Frequent rains .are not the only cause, for his most promising players have engaged in 
the process of eliminating each other until there is nothing left but seven names in an unknown order. However, the first best 
will be discovered before the team leaves on Wednesday night for a. week-end trip to points cast. Decisions over JBucknell and 
Temple are looked for, but the match with Georgetown is due 
to be a loss for the home team.
* )H >H *
PLEBE TENNIS PLAYERS totaled their wins to four
straight in the past week with the help of the W. and J. andDuquesne freshmen. Their efforts in the remainder of the sea­
son should produce a clean slate. Courshenhaused and Iiartwig have been showing up well in the first year lineup.

THE .FEMININE ATfy|iOS!l?IiEK.E that surrounds the 
tennis courts in the form of archery has finally crossed the fence 
and extended a hand in the racket wcilding business. The situ 
ation becomes more serious when it is learned that the player 
in question possesses such ability that would' easily place her on 
this year’s freshmen tennis team, were it not for precedents .ariel 
similar objections.
The honor of being the first probable team-mate of the fair, 
sex belongs to Dorothy AndGrson, of the Music department, who 
has extended her talented draw, of the bow to the lofty drive of the tennis racket. Besides having things her own way on 
the courts of Butler, Pa., Dot was the.runner up in the Western Pennsylvania Women’s Tournament.

THE WRESTLING PROTEGES, after a successful 
Campus Week, return to the mat with a new assortment'of holds in preparation for the Carnegie open matches to be held 
on Wednesday, May 20. It must be remembered that this com­petition is open to anyone who finds himself with that incentive 
to wrestle about in an inter-collegiate, fashion. All entries should be in the Athletic Office by tomorrow.

THE SOFTBALL LEAGUE is simmering down to a select group that represent the cream of all the mushballers of the 
campus. The close of this week will bring forth six teams that will bend every bat in order to secure a place in the final play-off.
i In last week’s encounters the S. A. E.s and Scobell Iiall tangled in a close game, the fraternity. winning S to 6. Welch 
Hall athletes nosed out the Beta’s, 9.to 8, in another thriller. 
.The playing of the winners should put them in line for a crack at the championship.
* * * .* *
THE SWIMMING TEAM OF 1932 has a large part of its work cut out with the schedule almost completed. The fact 
that only one member of this year’s team will be missed by 
graduation, and a strong Plebe combination will be available arc sufficient grounds to believe that the Skibo tankmen will make a new history for the Tartan pool.

Varsity Trackers Make Impressive 
Showing At W.&J,
Carnegie’s undefeated track team 
kept its 1931 score card , clean of 
defeats by crushing the Wash-Jcff 
track team by the overwhelming 
score of 104-30, at Washington 
hut AVednesday, May 6. The trip 
to the home of the Presidents 
seemed to have little affect on the 
fast moving Skibo aggregation who 
ran up the largest score in the his­
tory of Carnegie. In earning this 
score, the Tartans gained all the 
first placcs but one, that being- a 
tic in the broad jump. Together 
with these . firsts -were, six seconds 
and ten thirds, showing that the 
Tartans were superior to their 
rivals, in all departments. The 
track was in very poor condition, 
hence no track records were brok­
en, but John Karcis again broke 
the school record in the discus, 
this time heaving the plate 133 
feet.
Big Tom Coulter and George 
Neasc were again• high scorers for 
the Plaid; each capturing two first 
places. Coulter had little difficulty 
in winning the 120-yard high hur­
dled and the 220-yard low hurdles. 
In each of these events Smith of 
W. & J. -was second. Neasc seems 
to have hit his stride in the dashes, 
winning the hundred in 10.2 sec., 
and the 220-yard dash in 22.8. 
Blaine with a tic for first in the 
shot put, and a second in the dis­
cus, had seven points to his credit. 
Karcis and Armcntrout each had 
six points, each scoring a first and 
a third. Army got a; first in the 
hammer and a third in the high 
hurdles, while Karcis made his 
placcs in the discus and the shot 
put. Ewing, a newcomer, topic 
second in the quarter and third in 
the. 220. Ramsey breasted the tape 
first in the mile, completing the 
four laps in four minutes and 40 
seconds, which is fair time for the 
poor track. Little Jess Price 
showed his stamina and spirit by 
completely outclassing his oppo­
nents in the two mile. On a quar­
ter mile track he lapped two of 
his opponents. Emil Stankey, who 
has been there fighting all year, 
finally crashed through in the half 
mile with a first place. Magnuson 
had little difficulty winning the 
quarter although the time was fair­
ly slow. Stent/.', Brindle and Mur­
ray again scored nine points for 
the team by taking all placcs in 
the javelin throw. Stent/, finished 
first with a heave of 158 feet.
The track team, whiclj seems to 
be headed for an undefeated sea­
son, will have a tough time in the 
next two weeks, meeting three 
strong opponents in six days. They 
are idle until Saturday, when they 
meet the strong Geneva team, and 
I lien on Tuesday they meet our 
old rivals, Pitt. The Friday after 
the Pitt meet, the Tartans close 
tho season with Grovo City. The 
chances for a victory oV’cr Pitt are 
exceedingly bright, and the Plaid 
runners are planning to make Pitt 
pay dearly for I lie numerous set­
backs received in the '¦ last few 
years. Genova, who always has a 
good team, will offer a lot of com­
petition on Saturday, and the Trtr- 
tans will have to be in top shape 
to win. •
Kiski Track Tearn 
Gives First Defeat 
To Skibo Yearlings
Tile Plebe track team, showed 
unexpected strength in’ their meet 
last Tuesday with Kiski.-Although
the prepsters won 64to 52j4, it
was not without a battle, and the 
team as a whole feels /somewhat 
satisfied with the results of its first 
real test. The outstanding race of 
the day was the thrilling duel i:
the 880-yard run between Schell of
the Plcbcs and Kadlic ‘ of Kiski. 
ICadlic got off to a fine start, 
stretching out a long lead which 
lie held until the last half of a lap. 
Here Schell began an .extended 
sprint that fell short of first place 
by inches.

Wrestling Candidates 
Should Enter By 
Wednesday
Carnegie’s first atttempt at wrest­
ling is rounding into a shape that 
is likely to offer something very 
attractive in the way of individual 
contests. The time is set for 
May 20, and the entry list will be 
closed after Wednesday of this 
week. The mat performers arc 
being collcctcd from various parts 
of the school, further additions 
being expected from the track 
squad.
At present thefe is no such thing 
as a Plaid wrestling team, so the 
contestants in next week’s matches 
will clash on a somewhat equal 
basis. There will be eight or ten 
bouts in the various weight classes 
with prices for the winners of 
each. These prizes have been of­
fered by Mr. Overcnd, graduate 
manager.
The matches wilf be run accord­
ing to the regular intercollegiate 
rules which call for a ten-minute 
bout. The winner is determined 
by the number of points gained 
during the encounter. Points arc 
earned by time advantages which 
result from one wrestler holding 
his opponent in an unfavorable 
position.
If no time advantages arc in 
sight after two minutes of wrest­
ling, the referee may conduct two 
four-minute periods that arc begun 
from a special position. Should 
there be a draw at the end of ten 
minutes the referee may give a 
decision or declare two additional 
three-minute periods to be held.

W. & J., Duquesne Defeated By Skibo Varsity Court Men
Coach Hoover’s • varsity nctnicn 
completed another week of com­
petition without suffering a mis­
hap, stretching their string of vic­
tories to four. W. and J. and 
Duquesne were the victims, the 
former dropping a 4-3 decision on 
the local courts and the latter los­
ing 7-2 at the same place. A 
match scheduled with Geneva for 
Saturday was called off on account 
of wet grounds.
W. and J. offered much stiffer 
competition than expected, and 
only the final ^doubles match de­
cided the meet. "Stew” Dueger 
and Captain Morris, the Carnegie 
No. 1 and No. 2 men, both drop­
ped hard-fought matches and lost 
the doubles. Berghane, McClos- 
key and Gesling all came through 
with impressive victories, though, 
and a victory in the No. 2 doubles 
decided the joust in favor of the 
Tartans. The Skibos will return 
the visit on May 20, when they 
will again meet the Prcxics, this 
time on the Washington courts.
Duquesne, with the exception of 
the No. 1 singles and doubles 
matches, offered little opposition, 
although one or two matches were 
forced into three sets. Captain 
Andy Smeaton, the Irish leader 
who had not been beaten for 16 
matches until he met Jacobs last 
week, found “Stew" Dueger to be 
a tough ilut to crack and won 
out only after a grueling three set 
match. Dueger and Berghane 
teamed up in the doubles, but 
were unable o stop the well-placed 
drives of the Bluffmcn.
The toughest match of the year 
was scheduled for Monday, the 
Panthers opposing the Tartans on 
the stadium courts. Pitt’s strong­
est threat lies in Eddie Jacobs, 
who is one of the leading players 
in the country. Last week he sur­
prised the world by decisively 
beating Gregory Mangin , of 
GeorgetOAvn, No. 6 ranking play­
er in the United States. It Will 
be remembered that Mangin was a 
member of the Davis cup. team 
fast season:• }.< : , •'
On Thursday the team will, em­
bark on an Eastern trip/ when 
Buckncll, Temple and Georgetown 
will be met on successive days. 
Georgetown is by far the best of 
these teams, but the others arc 
also expected to furnish extremely 
tough opposition.

PLEBE TENNIS TEAM 
TAKES TWO MATCHES
While the varsity nctsters have 
been burning up the courts of this 
district, 'the plcbcs have been gar­
nering their share of victories also. 
This week they added W. and J. 
and Duquesne to their list of vic­
tims, both of them falling on their 
own courts.
W. and J. proved to be the 
toughest opposition encountered 
this season, the Tartans barely 
nosing them out by a 4-3 count. 
One of these matches was default­
ed, however, when it was seen 
that the plebes had cinched the 
meet. Four victories in the sin­
gles were the deciding factor in 
this joust, and in spite of the loss 
of both doubles .matches, the Skibo 
hopefuls were dccidcdly superior 
in all departments of the game. 
Hartig, No. 1 man, found Perkins 
of W. & J. to be a Tartar, the 
Pittsburgh school’s representative 
winning only after a hard three 
set match. This is the first time 
that Hartig has been extended to 
three sets this season.
Duqucsne offered little opposi­
tion to the hard accuratc shots of 
the Tartan racquctccrs, losing all 
seven matches. Only Wirshing 
met with any scmblance of diffi­
culty; after losing the ’first set, lie 
fought back to take . the second 
stanz.a 8-6, and then proceeded to 
win the finale easily.

CLUB DIRECTORS’
MEETING, MAY 14
The golf tournament, planned by 
the social committee of the Car­
negie Tech Club, which was held 
on Monday afternoon, May 4, 
proved to be a very enjoyable 
affair. Eycryonc agreed that the 
Shannopin Country Club was an 
ideal place to hold such a tourna­
ment, and wc hope that a little 
later in the season another one 
may be staged there, with- prob­
ably a larger representation.
The board of directors will hold 
its monthly meeting on Thursday 
evening, May 14, at the club head­
quarters, 421 Fifth avenue.
We' wish to repeat the special 
offer made to the fraternities at 
Tech about a month ago to be 
represented by their coats of arms 
on the walls' of the club. In order 
to have these insignia uniform in 
size and make, we requested the 
fraternities to mail in their check 
to the club, and we were able to 
quote a special price on these em­
blems through the courtesy of the 
Balfour Company. If this offer 
meets with your approval, wc 
should like to receive your fra­
ternity’s check as soon as possible. 
To date the Theta Xi, Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Phi 
Epsilon Fraternities have respond­
ed to our offer, and several other, 
fraternities have promised to do 
likewise. Wc expect a large per­
centage of the coming graduating 
class to join our ranks at the 
club, and wc feel certain that those 
who are members of fraternities 
will be especially interested in see­
ing their coats of arms in the club 
rooms.

TUESDAY, MAY 12, 1931.THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
A SECTION OF THE TARTAN 
DEVOTED TO THE 
NIGHT STUDENTS.TLhc Carnegie flMaiò
PAGE THREE
ALL RETURNS FOR DANCE 
TICKETS MUST BE MADE 
PROMPTLY
Are you among tliosc industrious 
night students who arc coming back 
' more knowledge? Monday night
of last week certainly reminded one 
of the fall when real registration 
is in progress. The big line, of men 
and women eager to take the sup­
plementary term courses kept those 
doing the necessary task of regis­
tering busy the whole evening. For 
some it was the first time to appear 
on the campus, for others, it was 
the first time this year, and for still 
others it was a picking up of a 
broken registration last fall. What­
ever class these students fall into, 
they certainly arc not going to let 
the hot evenings interfere with their 
' thirst for knowledge. Who knows, 
they may be served icc water before 
the term ends.
Campus week arrived at last, after 
a whole year’s wait. But it was a 
disappointment to those who worked 
for the affair, that is, the first night. 
Stage set for wonderful weather and 
presto Pluvious, or some such God 
let loose and down the water came 
on those fine decorations in front 
of the Arts Building. Sure did make 
everybody feel wet—outside. I hap­
pened to see some of the "bullet 
dancers,” I mean ballet dancers go­
ing through their antics on the night j
before, that is Wednesday, and it | 
was hot stuff, believe you me. From 
/ the way they cantered about the stage 
^ you would think they had nothing
' else to do. I sort of made up my
mind to sec the big show on Thurs­
day, but it had to rain. I am told
this* is the way most of the previous 
Campus Carnivals fared, so it wasn’t 
out of place. For me, it was too 
bad, because I had, to miss the show 
the following night. I haven’t got 
much information on the whole fcs' 
tivities, but I presume they went off 
in great style if anything from last 
year’s affair is any crittcrion. Wc 
will hear more of the affair later, 
hope.
Did you, or did you not pass 
- - '¿;~j;!os-' which were discussed fre­
quently during the past week. And 
with it all, there were some 
dividuals who thought the marks 
should be available the first night. 
Funny soirje people can’t wait. Now 
take my case, I don’t mind if I do 
have to wait. , It’s this way, if 
hear real soon, then I won’t have 
to wait under a suspense' and if I 
don’t hear promptly, I will have the 
pleasure of a suspense. The longer 
1 have to wait 'for the information 
the more suspense I will have 
undergo, and that is not the most 
unpleasant thing in college life. One 
should be educated to enjoy suspense, 
and where is there a better( place 
than at college when you arc waiting 
the results of your battle with the 
profs.
Speaking of grades, it is not to be 
wondered at if you have to wait a 
short time for your marks. The num­
ber of students registered in the 
night , courses is very large, and the 
nujftber of subjects which each stu­
dent enrolled for adds to the bur­
den of compiling this data,_ and it 
all happens in one short space of 
time—one week. I know the depart­
ment in charge of making out the 
reports and records must have 
lot to do and are kept busy all the 
time, so let’s be patient if we haven’t 
found out our grades and wait 
awhile, for the bad news will comc 
soon enough to us. Then maybe you 
will wish you hadn’t heard the bad 
newsr
Say, those two shclttcrs at the cut 
came in handy a couple of times for 
me recently, and' I know for some 
others too. Especially on the last 
Thursday evening. It was a good 
idea to have such placcs at the car 
stop so that one could wait for a 
slow moving—rapid passing street 
car. I suppose you have had all the i 
experiences I have with tlyt cars. | 
The; one-man ones in particular—the 
('iterator doesn’t see you waiting, but 
just drives past. Maybe he is going 
to. a fire or some such diversion, and 
the public, well thejr can wait, there 
will be another car soon, but don’t 
hold your breath for the following 
car. Some day, maybe, you will get 
better service; we can live in hopes.
I can hardly believe that I am 
going to night school, because it is 
day light during most of the time we 
arc at classes. It seems the time is 
twisted. It won’t be many more 
weeks before these sessions will be 
over then the next thing will be the 
summer session. I really believe they 
hand out education the whole year 
through. It is a twelve month col­
lege. Something doing all the time.
I wonder if the founder of the insti­
tution thought there would be such 
a demand for the training offered at 
Carnegie. It isn’t often you find such 
a place where they cater to all kinds 
of wants and needs of the students.
But then there is only one Carnegie 
• Tech, and that is our own big school.
REFLECTIONS
Now that the regular night school 
is over, and many of us arc about 
ready to enjoy a summer of freedom, 
the thought comes that night sessions 
are not such a rigorous experience 
after all. A little reflection on those 
things done during the past several 
months should furnish some grounds 
for thought. Try it, it’s quite thrill­
ing.
Do you remember registration 
night? Milling masses of humanity, 
humans thirsting for knowledge. Long 
registration cards . . . departmental 
interviews . . . endless questions . 
complicated schedules, and conflicting 
directions. The walk to the Gym­
nasium for the last ordeal . . . people 
hurrying about like busy ants . . . 
confusion and chaos seemed to reign 
supreme. Guides along the line gave 
3rou garbled directions (so you 
thought) . . . yoii became bewildered 
. .. were shoved, pushed, pulled. 
Cards were taken from you, others 
were handed back, it was maddening. 
Finally the cashier took your money 
and you sighed wistfully, hoping that 
the end was near. Still a few more 
barriers to hurdle and the end was 
in sight. Cards, pamphlets, and books 
were pushed into your hands, and 
finally a little red book was given 
you just as an open door loomed 
before you. Sighs of relief and heart 
felt words of “.thank goodness” 
escaped from you. The end had come 
and all that remained was to start 
class the following week.
THE PLAID ON SPORTS
The first few nights spent happily 
meeting old friends . . . making new 
ones, and then settling down to the 
regular routine of your schedule. 
Football games and an . occasional 
evening off helped to keep one’s 
interest alive, then came the first 
social functions of the year 
smokers, dances, ctc., what great 
evenings they were.
Winter arrived ... to stay with us 
for some time . . . skating now and 
then... this life is not so bad after 
all . . . the time is going by rapidly 
. . . Christmas vacation . . . the New 
Year . . . more social events, and 
then . . . mid semester. Examinations 
held the center of the stage . . • 
the atmosphere becamc fogged..', 
there was a little tightening up . . 
and finally all was over and we start­
ed on the last lap of the year. More 
smokers, dances, parties . . . the life 
of toil and pleasure made a happy 
combination. The end seemed to be 
approaching . . . one more those 
examinations loomed before us . . . 
the finals this time ... cpuld wc 
make it . . . maybe the profs would 
get us when wc least cxpectcd it. 
Our whole being tightened up . . . 
we awaited the worst, meanwhile at­
tending a few class gatherings to 
bid farewell to our classmates until 
next year . . . then the end. Sudden­
ly wc find ourselves free, unfettered, 
loosened from all ties and wc arc 
lost in our new found freedom. But 
like the adaptable creatures that wc 
arc, wc quickly accustom ourselves 
to our new life and go on merrily.

CLYDE ST., PITTSBURGH 
SUNDAY SERVICES 11 A. M. 8 P. M.
Sundav School 11 A. M.
W ednesday Evening Testimony Meeting ________ At 8:00 P. M.
Using a somewhat simplified and 
consequently-doubtful method of rea­
soning, a group of scientists recently 
estimated the age of the earth as ap­
proximately two thousand million 
years. The basis of their decision is 
founded on the peculiarities of several 
of the elements, usually called “radio­
active” elements, which disintegrate 
spontaneously into lead.
Kniwing that these elements, chiefly 
uranium and thcorium, disintegrate at 
a constant and determinable rate, and 
that the products of the disintegra­
tion arc known, the method consisted 
chiefly of analyzing a piece of 
iiranite, a uranium bearing rock. With 
the products present in the rock, 
and their quantities determined, it 
was a comparatively simple matter to 
combine the quantities produced with 
the rate of production and thus 
estimate the total time required for 
the disintegration to have reachcd its 
present stage. Simple, what?
However, the estimate is of the 
same type as many other scientific 
guesses. If the answer to a geologi­
cal, paleontological, or astronomical 
question comes out with a sufficiently j 
large string of ciphcrs after the 
few significant figures, everyone ii 
happy, especially the geologists, 
paleontologists and astronomers.
Voliva, of course, takes the other 
extreme, but we must admit that it’s 
anyone’s guess, ¿o don’t feel bad if 
the scientific figures disagree with 
any of your own previous guesses. 
10 to the xth power years from 
now, your guess may becomc famous 
(for it’s accuracy or inanity) if you 
arrange to have it printed in an im­
posing volume incorporated with a i 
great deal of sarcasm and satire di 
rccted at everyone clse's guess.

Once again the Plaid comes 
forth with commcnt on Carnegie 
athletics. The spirit of this col­
umn seems to be awakened about 
two or' three times a year and 
proceeds to make known to the 
waiting world the esteem in which 
Tartan athlctics arc held bv the 
average night student. It is hard­
ly necessary that this spirit should 
be .aroused from its slumbers as 
often as it docs occur, for the 
Plaid Scrcen covers about every­
thing in the way of sports.
Our track team is going great 
guns and has not bumped into 
any opposition which niight be 
considered as being too tough _just 
yet. However, if such opposition 
should present itself, wc feel cer­
tain that the boys have enough 
spunk in reserve to overcome any 
lead. The meet with the Univer­
sity of Cincinnati showed of what 
kind of stuff the boys arc made. 
That was their closest score this 
season.
Just a word about our boxing 
team. Although this was the first 
year for the boys to demonstrate 
their ability in the manly art of 
self defense, no one can deny that 
the spirit shown by the team was 
anything but true blue. They took 
the several reverses, handed to 
them by more experienced teams 
without a whimper and came right 
back for more. With more train­
ing and coaching we should have 
a good team of mit Svcildcrs: 
Every man on the team had the 
old Carnegie spirit of ncvcr-ycll- 
quits. A team with such intestinal 
fortitude is bound to go far.
Last week’s Tartan carried the! 
announcement of a wrestling exhi­
bition, to be held May 20, in which 
all students arc invited to com­
pete. The purpose of this exhibi­
tion is to find the material for 
wrestling team that exists on our 
campus and to determine how en­
thusiastic the studpnt body is for 
such an addition to the athletic 
activities of th«T school.
Wrestling, like boxing, should 
find a sympathetic s.tudcnt body 
here at Carnegie. We have the 
material with „the earnestness and 
ambition that is charactertistic of 
all Carnegie,.athletic teams and 
coach's job is not so hard when 
that state of mind exists in hi: 
underlings. He can devote his en­
tire time to the teaching of funda 
mentals and practice and develop i 
better team. Several night students 
arc more than passively interested 
in the formation of a Carnegie 
wrestling team and this, new 
dcrtaking will be closely followed 
by them.
The fratcrnity-dormitory mush 
ball league comes in for a big 
play by the night students, believe 
it or not. Almost every evening 
now finds a game in progress 
along the cut. As the usual night 
shift hour is 7:30, the walk is 
usually lined up with, night stu­
dents who, before classts start, en­
joy the pastime as much as the 
participants.
The Plaid has often wondered 
how a short column on sports as 
seen by a night student would ap­
peal to the night student body. 
Let’s liavc your comments and 
possibly next year something defi­
nite on this line may be establish- , 
cd.
VACATION TIME
The weary drag of a long sea­
son of night school is over and wc 
now find ourselves set down in the 
ccntcr of nothing to do.
“Says you!” from the fellow who 
started last week to spade his 
garden, clean wall paper and 
paint window screens. “I can’t 
wait ’til next October, when my 
vacation starts. You see, my work 
is only beginning. Four nights a 
week at Carnegie is to me a source 
of recreation.”
Poor man, but there arc many 
such as lie who conic to Carnegie 
in the winter evenings. There arc 
others who look upon life in a 
less serious manner, and when ap-'j 
proachcd will most likely answer 
thus:
“Vacation! And howl I threw 
bucket of paint on the old liz 
last week, bought a new spark 
plug and a half pint of oil and I’m 
all set to catch up in my spring 
necking. Y’scc, I’m about two 
months behind.”
So it goes. What might be 
termed a vacation by one person 
is only the transposition of tiring 
efforts to another. : What is a va­
cation, anyway! Is it a period of 
complete relaxation; of mental and 
physical rest? Or is it only a 
change of occupation or scenery, 
as one employer has put it. In 
the second named instance, a 
street car motorman enjoys a per­
petual vacation, for his occupation 
includes a constant change of 
scenery. On the other hand, it 
would be an impossibility to have 
complete relaxation, free from 
mental and physical exertion, unless 
one were unconscious. And that 
state is not our idea of a way in 
which to enjoy a vacation.
A vacation may well be defined 
(without consulting Webster) as a 
period of relief from the general 
routine of a certain line of en­
deavor. How docs that click when 
applied to night students? Re­
gardless of what our daily calling 
may be, our nightly activities for 
the past seven months or so have 
been a fixed schedule. When wcl 
are relieved from this fixed sched­
ule by certain examinations we arc 
said to be exposed to a vacation 
from our night studies. If wc so 
choosc to spend the summer 
unconscious state, wc may be 
accuscd of enjoying our vacation 
while if wc choosc to spend the 
time between now and Octobcr by 
throwing stones at the neigh 
chickcns and whitewashing 
the back fcncc we will find our­
selves guilty of the same crime 
It is mostly a matter of opinion 
which is influcnccd by the inflated 
or deflated condition of the family 
wallet, whether a vacation is ; 
cation or just a vacation. I hope 
that I have made myself clear. If 
not, may I suggest a pair of 
smoked glasses in order that you 
may better sec the light. That’s 
that.
G.
Understanding Music
George Copeland, noted pianist, 
stuck a note of encouragement for 
those people who arc ashamed tc 
admit that they do not “understand’ 
music when lie said that these peo­
ple really enjoy a composition and 
derive more benefit from it than 
those persons who say they “under­
stand."
Mr. Copeland remarks, and truly 
too, that the surest way to lose 
interest in anything is to know all 
about it. This statement can be borne 
out by many of our own private 
experiences. Many of us have found 
that wc were set, upon obtaining a 
certain objective, and, when wc at­
tain it, wc found that it wasn’t such 
an achievement after all, as far as 
wc were concerned.
While this is a somewhat morbid 
attitude to take, wc must remember 
that it is just some such sentiment 
that causcd the philosophers to re­
gard victory in any form as 
empty thing. Then too, most of 
just don’t care. Wc have our hopes 
and ambitions before us (’way be­
fore us) and have struggled so long 
that the outcomc is more or less 
immaterial, just so wc can enjoy 
the present and forget the Future.

With the Inter-Night College 
Dancc last Saturday evening, the 
social calendar of the Night Stu­
dent Council camc ,to a successful 
end. There is, however, much 
work to be done by the officers 
and other members of the council 
before their business of the year 
is completed.
The co-operation received from 
the many students whose work 
made these dances and other so­
cial functions the talk of the cam- 
puts was splendid. But there is 
still one item of no mean impor­
tance that wc ask you to give your 
immediate attention. That is the 
matter of making prompt returns 
for dancc tickets sold for all coun­
cil dances.
You may recall that the council 
has ruled that, beginning this year, 
insignias will be awarded on a 
point basis; that is, a student will 
receive a certain number of points 
for doing certain work and a re­
quired number of points arc neces­
sary to earn an insignia. Tickets 
sold help the student towards the 
required number of points and un­
less returns arc made promptly, 
these earned po.ints may be lost.
As the committee on awards will 
meet very shortly, it is the duty of ( 
every -night student who has not 
made complete returns for tickets 
sold, to attend to this matter with 
Mr, E. E. McDonald, treasurer of 
the Night Student Council.
The.night students of the Depart­
ment of Heating and Ventilating held 
their annual banquet on Monday eve­
ning, May 4, at the Carndgic Inn 
Dining Room.
The guests of the evening were 
Professor S. E. Dibble, H. A. Steiner 
and J. H. Sansonctti. At the con­
clusion of the dinner, several in­
teresting talks were given. Emphasis 
was made as to the position which 
the heating and ventilating trade 
holds in the industrial world by 
both Professor Dibble and Mr. 
Steiner. Mr. Sansonctti, who was in­
troduced by F. C Collins spoke on 
the Night Student Council, and told 
of the benefits which have been dc-1 
rived from this organization by the 
night student body. It was pointed 
out that the night students were 
fortunate in having such a body 
represent them on the campus. Many 
questions were answered by Mr. San­
sonctti concerning the work of the 
Council.
Like all 'good things, the much en­
joyed evening finally camc to an end. 
After an all ground exchange of 
good wishes the members and guests 
left with the sinccrc hope that next 
school term would sec them all en­
rolled at Carnegie.
Mr. John Thomas, Chairman, and 
all those who worked with him to j 
make the dinner such a success arc 
to be congratulated on the success­
ful manner in which the affair was 
conducted.
WHAT IS A TEACHER?
Statisticians complain that it is 
difficult to compile anything like a 
reliable definition for a teacher. This 
is because the various states In­
different requirements and it make!, 
it almost impossible to account for 
the teaching profession in the census 
figures. Many of us arc undecided 
about this point too. Wc all 
well dccidcd individually upon 
mentors, but as to others—who cares 
It is astounding to note that the 
large majority of instructors and pro­
fessors at Carnegie arc exceedingly 
human and likeable. Of course, there 
is that type of person who needless­
ly antagonizes the professors and 
then condemn • them as sour soulcd 
philosophers, or jvorsc. In most 
cases of dissatisfaction, investigation 
usually proves that both arc at fault, 
Allowances of a larger order must 
be made for the instructor than for 
the student, in many cases. Teach­
ing never has been an easy job, 
especially at night, and, while few 
of us consider the question, our 
faculty is overworked in many cases. 
Most- of them have day and night 
classes, and for economic reasons, 
indulge in outside work too. So 
let’s temper our grievances with that 
thought.

MATHEMATICS
Vacate Your Locker
The Plaid wishes to call the at­
tention of the night students to 
the notices appearing on the bul­
letin boards and in the last issue 
of the Plaid relative to lockers.
As you know, a different plan 
was put in force last year when 
loekers were issued to students. 
The old method of returning lock­
er keys has been dispensed with. 
The present plan calls for the stu­
dent to remove his lock, which lie 
bought, from the locker occupied 
by him and to hold the lock un­
til next fall, when a new loeker 
will be assigned to him.
All locks and contents of look­
ers must be removed by August 1, 
1931. After that date, your locker 
will be opened and you will lose 
what property you have left in it. 
Students who arc taking supple­
mentary courses should bear this 
in mind as their classes extend be­
yond the final edition of the Plaid 
and notice may not appear again.
G
Thistles Soon Available
Night students who ordered 
Thistle, the Carnegie year book, 
may expect to receive them soon. 
The exact date of delivery is not 
known as yet, but it is not fa 
off. The entire contents of this 
year’s book have been kept secret 
by the Thistle staff, but informa­
tion on some of the unusual fea­
tures of this volume has been 
made known.
For instance, there is a section 
devoted to scenes and pictures of 
the various buildings on the cam­
pus, printed in full color. This 
feature alone will make the book 
a souvenir to be cherished by one 
who has been a student at Car­
negie for several years. The cov­
er is of a unique design that sur-,
The. theory held by many profes­
sors in the teaching of the higher 
mathematics is now being subjected 
to very exacting research. For a 
great many years men clung to the 
idea that a thorough system of brain 
torture in the form of foolish and 
impractical mathematical gymnastics 
was necessary before a man could 
be trusted to build a bridge, tunnel, 
road, or any other construction work. 
It would seem, however, that the 
more modern teachers and employ­
ers realize that the only thing neces­
sary is for the man to know how to 
go about his particular job.' This 
naurally leads to the conclusion that, 
while mathematics arc, necessary, the 
more practical studies, i. c. physics or 
chemistry should be given some at­
tention.
If. as some claim, a man cannot 
comprehend the mysteries of,a whirl­

it would appear that the human race 
is truly on the decline. The mathe­

relieve this sad situation by permit­
ting the teachers of the other basic 
subjects to utilize just a little more 
of the student's time—^(at least twen- 
tv-five per cent.)

“THE THINKER
. a telephone version
The name Electrical Thinker might be ap­
plied to one unit of telephone apparatus. 
Technically it is known as a Sender and is 
brought into action each time a call is made 
in a panel dial central office. By means of 
electrical mechanism, it records or “remem­
bers” the dialed number and routes the call 
to the proper line.
The steady expansion of the Bell System
— in volume of calls, number of telephones 
and miles of wire — cannot be taken care of 
merely by an enlarged use of existing types 
of apparatus.
To serve the continually growing telephone 
needs of the nation, it will always be the task 
of Bell System men to devise, refine, perfect 
and manufacture new kinds of equipment 
such as The Thinker.

Tartan Platform
More and better equipped club-roo'ms.Better seating' accommodations for- students at. athletic 
¡events.More interest in student- activities.Faculty co-operation in regard to three hour exam limit.An increase in the activities fee'or a re-apportionment of 
the present fee to aid student publications.
The Alumm Federation
This week the Alumni ¡Federation is conducting its annual 
jnenrbership campaign among fhe members of the graduating 
class. £very senior should attempt to join the Federation for 
the benefits derived from Smen]bership are innumerable. It is the only connecting link between the alumni and the school and 
often between the alumni themselves, especially those who will 
shortly leave Pittsburgh. There is a Carnegie Clan in most every large city, sponsored by the Federation, which hold1 va­
rious, social events and other affairs calculated to bring Carne- 
gians together in all parts of the country. It is through the 
Federation that alumni secure.scats for athletic events, tags for the Spring Carnival and oftentimes good positions in the busi­
ness world. The privileges of the new Carnegie Tech club- 
rooms downtown arc. also.. available to members in good 
Standing.The annual dues arc sm«>U and certainly the benefits derived 
far overshadow the investment.
Random Thoughts
With this issue of the Tartan, the present staff will take a 
permanent leave of absence with a feeling of regret, to be sure 
but also with a certain amount of satisfaction. YVc believe we 
have accomplished a few good things this year, and it is our 
hope that the incoming staff will continue the policies we have 
adopted,Before our departure there arc some things we would like 
to recommend to the Administration and to those who will be 
in charge of student activities next year. The items listed in the platform are nearly all of a nature outside the immediate 
hands, of the students;, three of them pertain directly to the Ad­
ministration and one to the Athletic. Association.The school is in need of more ,elubrooms and certainly some 
place could be found to pul: them. The need has been apparent 
for several years,, the students, through the Tartan have re­
quested them for several years, hut ,the Administration always 
seems to turn its ear to some commercial project like coal re­
search laboratories. It should have been apparent at the Car­
negie Day exercises two years ago that a new library was most in demand by the students. We realize that a library at 
this time is out of the question, but several new clubrooms 
would; at least, be a step in the proper direction and it is hoped that the Administration will soon realize this fact.
This year’s Spring Carnival was a huge success both so­
cially and financially and next year, perhaps, it would be advis­
able to broaden the program'and to include the Senior Ball as part of the Carnival festivities. Such a plan would make a more 
concentrate^ week of festivities, but it would eliminate the 
heavy .financial drain on the students which two such affairs as 
this year demanded. It would also eliminate Student Council’s responsibility of making both affairs financial successes.
This year’s Student Council has done well, and nearly every activity has made money or, at least, broken even.. We con­
gratulate them and hope that next year’s group will do equally as well.
HARRY KOLB
(Continued from Page One) 
lion of Marvin Fox, president of 
council, recommended that the 
Resolutions Committee consider a 
change in the method of financing 
the Women’s Junior Prom, which 
has in previous years placed the 
burden of paying for two dances 
at one time upon the junior wom­
en. The senior class this year 
will leave a considerable surplus 
which they suggested might be 
used in carrying out this new 
plan.
Council also granted the request 
of the University and College 
Song Book Company to use two 
Carnegie Songs—the Alma’ Mater 
and "Fight for the Glory of 
Carnegie”—-in a new book of 
American College Songs which it 
Is compiling for publication.

Howdy, Yo’ All I
Although the weather did its best 
to start a new depression, the May 
Festival, Campus Week, Spring Carni­
val, or what do you want to call it? 
went over with colors flying. The 
boys and girls arc pepped up enough 
now to last the remainder of the 
school year out without doing too 
much studying. The social season 
rcachcd its peak with the week-end’s 
festivities, and from now on it’s all 
recovery. Most of the Seniors will 
have recovered in time to take their 
exams in two weeks, and those who 
haven’t can take the re-exams.
The rain would have turned the 
Coronation exercises into a swim­
ming meet Thursday night, and so 
the official crowning was done Fri' 
day. Neither rain nor water from 
the' roof appeared to spoil Friday’s 
events. Don Bonhoff, as the Charm 
ing Prince, rescued Betty Steele 
from the flames, and obtained re­
wards multifold. How about, some of 
the boys who fixed up the setting, 
Betty? The ladics-in-waiting, grace­
fully attired in flowing robes and 
dunce-caps, looked great but missed 
an opportunity for entertainment by 
not using their hand mirrors to re­
flect spot-lights into the crowd. 
Madame Queen” received a large 
bouquet, which rested on a ease of 
pop all night, and a very nice ncck- 
lacc as a little remembrance of her 
coronation.
The Costume Ball Friday night 
was the best party of the week-end 
even if the Delts did wear over­
alls. They were parlor over-alls, 
though, being of a delicate canary 
color. The Phi Kaps went French 
and appeared in berets. The Belas 
wore tlieir Sunday shirts with big 
red dragons painted on the backs. 
Chuck Ewing did the dragons, and 
did them well, did lie. The Kappa 
Sigs went Spanish, with red vests, 
green sashes, ovd white trousers. 
The Sigma Nus went native, with 
P. Js. of all descriptions. The Phi 
Psis and D. Us. came as sailors of 
the briny deep, which was quite 
apropos. The Bela Sigma Rho .out­
fits were Roosliian in character. The 
Dragons wore the usual black shirts 
xuilh the little red lizards on the 
side. The Building Construction boys 
joined in the spirit of the occasion 
with their coat-of-arms emblazoned 
on their shirt-fronts. The coat-of- 
arms consisted of saw and sledge, 
crossed. The S. P. Es. were inno­
cents abroad with their children's 
clothing. Paul Kramer looked, more 
like a little kid Ilian a little kid does.
The exercises in the gym Friday 
afternoon were well-attended, which 
is a life-saver for future May Festi­
vals. The authorities, after cutting 
down the Campus Week of old to 
one free day, had threatened to 
eliminate even the one free day in 
case the Qualifications exercises were 
not well attended. In such a case 
the May Festival would be just an­
other week-end.
The welding of the link for the 
Class of IQ34 was quite an operation. 
The fire went out and the black­
smiths had to borrow a match from 
a member of the spectators. When 
the fire did start, it didn’t know 
where to stop, and soon resembled 
a forest fire, filling the tof> of the 
gym with smoke. Bell Bryant, Mas­
ter of Ceremonies, and "Queenie" 
Hetty, enthroned nearby, were slight­
ly sun-burned from the heat.
George Ncasc, in presenting a 
gavel to Marvc Fox as a memento 
of the hitter’s Student Council Presi­
dency, had to make a little speech 
which giivc him lots of trouble. He 
was aftold that he would say some­
thing like this, "I take pleasure in 
presenting to you George Kavcl, on 
behalf—." He managed to get out 
the proper words, however.
The Honorarics arc filled up for 
another year. All those people sitting 
on the edges of their chairs were 
hopefuls waiting for the fateful an­
nouncement. There were signs that 
a famous personage was to be 
called to one of the Women’s Honor­
arics, when announccr Bryant hesi­
tated after the first name "Lydia," 
but the lucky one turned out to be 
a student. The committee almost had 
to move. back the ropes when Cwcns 
made their call, as they took in 22 
new members. According, to Gloria 
Ivloos, the Madame Cwen, the large 
number is due to a new group in 
their society, called Sea-Cwcns. The 
members will be noted for their 
clam-like behavior.

With double prices for refreshments

opolized by the senior honorary, 
someone should make out. In Ye 
Goode Oldc Days the sororities were

that is forbidden and the -monopoly 
is complete with the profits going to

associations. Students who have 
attended at least one year of day 
school or two *ycars of a regular

SUPPORT YOUR COLLEGE
(Continued from Page One) 
like an automobile without a steer 
ing wheel. The other is a com­
plete and comprehensive list of the 
students.
There is another way in which 
you can support these publications, 
and that is by contributing to 
iheni.
So give your collcgc publication's 
a big hand—for j'ou and for them 
—from now on. Plan now to 
come back next year and help your 
schodl to a place in the front rank 
by services more tangible than 
football cheers.
Out of loss •.
...a gain
When the great war placed an embargo 
on imports from the Central Powers, 
American industry found itself deprived 
of many necessary products. Among them 
the standard asbestos sheet packing then 
in general use.
A substitute had to be found. Accord­
ingly Crane Co. procured every sheet 
packing that could be obtained. Using 
the old one as a basis of comparison, not 
one was found which could equal its ten­
sile strength, compressive strength, or 
heat resistance.
So the best American sheet was chosen 
and its manufacturer called in. Experi­
ment after experiment was made until a 
sheet was produced that not only equalled 
but surpassed the imported product. It 
was named Cranite.
The story of Cranite is typical. For 76 
years Crane Co. has striven unceasingly 
to produce and sell only materials of the 
highest quality. When progress calls for 
entirely new materials, our engineers are 
never satisfied until they have made that 
product or that substitute surpassingly 
fine. When in practicing the branch of 
engineering you are now studying, some 
piping problem arises, bring it to Crane 
Co. You will find just such co-operation.
