Charlie Spivak’s Orchestra 
At CFP Formal January 5
Three days of school separate Christmas vacation from the 
CIT fraternities’ biggest function of. the year, the Council of Fra­
ternity Presidents formal on January 5.
Charlie Spivak and his orchestra will open the new year at
the Syria Mosque, playing from 9 
till 1 for the still wide-awake 
Greeks. Each house will have a 
breakfast following the dance un­
til 2:30 p.m.
Adding to the spirit of the dance 
will be a colorful backdrop be­
hind the orchestra consisting of 
each fraternity’s crest. Dick 
Woods, decorations chairman, has 
asked that each house submit a 
two foot high replica of its crest in 
color to him before Christmas va­
cation.
Chaperones also will be fur­
nished by the individual fraterni-
Prof. Socliatoff 
Will Discuss 
Rebel Writers
Who the great rebels of world 
literature are and what sort of 
private worlds they created will 
be analyzed in a series of six lec­
tures by Professor A. Fred Soeh- 
atoff of Carnegie Tech, on six 
Monday evenings beginning Jan­
uary 7, 1952, at 8:15, at the YM& 
WHA on Bellefield Avenue.
Dr. Sochatoff \yill examine the 
i -lConVentional activities of au­
thors writing ifi four great periods 
of world literature. He will discuss 
the unwillingness of those recog­
nized Titans to be confined by es­
tablished standards of behavior, of 
belief, of literary practice, of po­
litical activity. He will show that 
their rebellion gained expression 
in writing that transcended the 
utterance of their protest to 
possess genuine merit and ready 
readability.
Among the authors who will be 
commented on are Sappho, Catul­
lus, Ovid, Boccaccio, Cellini, Ra­
belais, Hardy, Balzac, de Maupas­
sant, Verlaine, Dowson. Symons, 
Proust, Wilde, Gi<4e, Kafka, Brecht 
and Cdrtre.
Registration for the entire ser­
ies of lectures ^is being accepted 
currently 'through the office of the 
Seder Educational Center, YM& 
WHA, MAyflower 1-6500.

Sally, a junior Home JEc student

ties. It is suggested that each 
house have two sets for their 
breakfast and invite them to the 
dance. :
The formal is being held in the 
ballroom of the Mosque—the en­
trance is from Bigelow boulevard. 
Checking service will be provided.
It is also desired that no 
flowers be worn, but the Council 
of Fraternity Presidents will pro­
vide a corsage for each of the 
women chaperones.
Each fraternity man has paid 
for the dance through part of the 
annual CFP assessment.
Organizations
All organizations on the 
Carnegie campus are remind» 
ed that they are required to 
submit complete membership 
lists to Student Council if they 
have not already done so. 
These lists may be left in the 
office of the dean of students 
or sent to Council via inter­
school mail. The absolute 
deadline is December 15.
Summer Jobs
Juniors in the college of En­
gineering and Science who are 
interested in summer employ­
ment have been asked to fill 
out employment cards in the 
dean of students office before 
January 15.
Blood Donation 
Campaign Nets 
161 Needed Pints
The visit of the Red Cross Blood 
Mobile Thursday to the CIT cam­
pus has been reported successful, 
with a net of 161 pints obtained.
The difference between the yield 
and the number of scheduled con­
tributions is attributed to 12 re­
jections for medical reasons, and 
the fact that a total of 24 of those 
who were scheduled failed to ap­
pear. Part of the deficit was rem­
edied, however, by the presence 
of unscheduled donors.
The number of persons wish­
ing to give blood was so great 
that twice as much could have 
been taken if the facilities had 
been available.
Council expects to have the unit 
return sometime in March of 
1952.
CIT Fraternities Plan 
Orphans ’ Yule Parties
Nine of Carnegie’s 12 social fraternities plan definitely to include 
Chirstmas parties, for underprivileged children in their pre-vacation 
activities. Others have not made definite plans as y6t, but addi­
tional parties are a possibility. *
Programs for these events in­
clude most everything from tur­
key dinners and Christmas trees 
to Rege Cordic. Santa Claus will, 
of course be a prominent feature 
at all the parties, where that ven­
erable gentleman will dole out 
gifts to the guests.
It is hoped that none of the 
faithful discover that the benign 
Mr. Claus has appeared at two 
different houses simultaneously, 
as he is quite likely to do.
The series will be started to­
morrow, when Beta Theta Pi will 
entertain some 25 orphans. On 
Friday the DU’s will play host to 
30 more.
The business will get into -full 
swing on Sunday, when both the 
PiKA’s and thé Phi Kaps plan 
parties for the late afternoon or 
early evening. Monday will see 
orphans treated at the Beta Sig 
and TX houses, while the events 
will be rounded off by Kappa

COUNCIL IN ACTION
1 Events of the last few weeks have put Council in a mood to 
light a fire under somebody. The question is: who or what gets 
the ax.
Scimitar Put On Council Griddle 
In New Organizations Probe
SC To Light Fires Under Campus Groups;
Social Committee Due For Needed Overhaul
Prompted to action by the recent ‘dissolution’ petition, Student 
Council has launched what may be a far-reaching probe into the 
entire student organization system here at Carnegie Tech. The ac­
tion stemmed from a special Sunday meeting called a week ago to 
consider the problems of studen‘4-----------------------------------------------------
organization, including Council 
itself, and their relation to the 
school and “school spirit.”
First on the griddle at last 
Wednesday’s meeting was Scimi­
tar, the sophomore honorary so­
ciety. Councilman Schecter mov­
ed open discussion be held, which 
passed, and then asked Scimitar 
President Phil Drew just what 
Scimitar was supposed to do and 
what it actually did.
Constitution Unclear 
Drew replied that Scimitar’s 
constitution was a little hazy on 
the first point (which defect is 
being corrected.), but that his or­
ganization, among other things, 
monitored the freshmen tradi­
tions exam, graded the papers, 
sold tickets for last year’s Spring 
Carnival, and was doing work on 
school spirit and traditions in gen­
eral.
Schecter and Council President 
Davidson, who relinquished the 
chair to take part in the discus­
sion, agreed that Scimitar, orig­
inally set up as a sophomore rec­
ognition honorary, is actually per­
forming the duties of a service or­
ganization. But various motions 
calling for a strict rewriting of the 
constitution, under penalty of re­
vocation, were all defeated.
Scimitar, however, is going 
ahead with its own constitutional 
revision, Council or no Council. 
So a special committee has been 
set up, headed by Ray Mangold, 
to assist Scimitar with the amend­
ing process.
. Other Motion 
A motion was also passed to the
effect that “Student Council look 
into the activities and functions 
of its own committees and have 
the committees draw up their du­
ties, procedures, and recommenda­
tions for change.”
Tomorrow’s meeting should find 
the social committee under fire— 
proposed revisions of the duties of 
the social committee, especially 
concerning the need for a rigid so­
cial calendar a year in advance, 
were tabled till this week.
Council accepted the resignation 
of Bob Stroble because of “pres­
sure from school work and ac­
tivities.”
Game Change
The Carnegie-Bethany bas­
ketball game, originally sched­
uled for Wednesday, Decem­
ber 12, in the Skibo gym, has 
been postponed for one day, 
and will be played Thursday, 
December 13.
18 Alpha Phi Omega Members 
Attend Washington Convention
Alpha Phi Omega, scouting service fraternity, will have its semi­
annual initiation and installation banquet on December 16. The ban­
quet, in the Carnegie Union, will mark the 26th anniversary of the 
-day APO was founded at Lafayette College.
Mr. Carl J. Long, Pittsburgh en- ? 
gineer and Carnegie alumnus, will 
be the main speaker. Mr. Long is
a charter member of Carnegie’s 
chapter and was its first president. 
He is now a scout executive of the 
Silver Tip district of the Boy 
Scouts.
Attended Conference
Fifteen officers and advisers will 
be installed at the meeting. Also,
17 new pledges, ranging from 
freshmen to seniors, will be initi­
ated.
On December 1 and 2, APO sent
18 representatives to an Eastern 
Seaboard Regional conference in 
Washington, DC. Carnegie’s chap­
ter, Kappa, had the second largest 
delegation of the 1? chapters pres­
ent. Only Zeta Theta chapter from 
Drexel Tech in Philadelphia had 
more representatives, 22. The del-
egates attended meetings dealing 
with service projects, administra­
tion, etc.
Used Scout Knife
Kent D. Shaffer, one of Kappa’s 
faculty advisors, was the repre­
sentative from the national presi­
dent and started the conference 
with a well received talk.
For any doubting Thomas or ru­
mor monger, the signs on Web 
Hall are spelled correctly. APO 
pledge Bob Dannels, who con­
structed these masterpieces, re­
ports that the Web is short for 
Webster, and ^l^refore should 
have only onfgjpP’. The pledges 
kept APO a ^Wuting organization 
when they erected these signs; 
they were fixed to the building 
with the aid of a scout knife.
Home Ec Dinner 
Will Be Held 
December 13
Margaret Morrison faculty will 
take an active part in the enter­
tainment at the annual Home Eco­
nomics club Christmas dinner on 
Thursday, December 13, by pre­
senting a skit along with two oth­
er groups. The dinner will begin 
at 5:30 p.m. in the Rec hallj 4th 
floor, MMCC building.
The other entertaining groups

The meal is being prepared for 
this banquet by the institutional 
management class. Approximate­
ly 126 girls are expected to be 
present.
Dean Alexander of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College and 
Miss Crow, head of the home eco­
nomics department, will be guests. 
There will be group singing fol­
lowing the dinner.
Carnegie Tech’s Home Eco­
nomics club is one of the largest 
chapters in Pennsylvania.

TAWANTUESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1951
Editorials—
Don’t Blame Us
During the past year we have seen many activities and 
dances fail or fall apart at the seams, and the blame for 
much of this has been laid to a lack of publicity. There 
have been a few occasions when this has been a legiti­
mate excuse, but many times it is used as the most con- : 
venient way to ‘pass the buck.’
Even in the few cases when there has actually been a j 
lack of publicity, the leaders of the group have failed to j 
realize the true reason for the failure. Publicity isn’t some- j 
thing that comes from nowhere and plants itself on the j 
bulletin boards and newspapers, but is an outgrowth of a 
little planning, and mostly a lot of hard work and deter­
mination.
Considering dances for a minute, we have noticed that j 
several groups, upon organization, have appointed one per- ; 
son to be the publicity manager, without thinking whether ; 
he was qualified or not. A person doesn’t have to be a P&D \ 
or an architect, or exceptional on the business end of a ; 
brush to handle publicity; but he does need a few good pro- j 
motion ideas and the will to carry through all that he or- I 
iginally plans.
Along with this, another failure of these dance com­
mittees in their initial planning is” that they don’t realize 
the necessity of getting their publicity organized early and 
functioning long before the other phases. Good publicity 
can only be achieved by a lot of serious thinking, which 
doesn’t have to lead to any elaborate ideas but only a smooth 
campaign that advertises the dance exactly as it will be.
Because the above ideas appear idealized, and no doubt 
are since many of the organizations sponsoring these dances 
have n£ver done it before or have new people behind the 
wheel, we should arrive at some more practical solution.
Almost every group behind a dance is directly under 
Student Council, or has the financial end of the dance cov­
ered by Council’s budget committee. Therefore it seems 
that the Councilmen would be directly interested in the 
financial outcome of each dance since they have to cover 
each of the losses. One of the best ways to assure financial 
success is to have good publicity. So why doesn’t Council, 
either through the budget committee or some other, issue 
some rules and ideas that any publicity chairman could 
follow to insure a reasonable advertising campaign. Thus, 
Council could have itself a lot of sweat, money, and prestige.
Most of all, though, these various publicity managers 
must realize that the only way to a successful campaign 
is a lot of hard work. Bulletin board committees aren’t 
going to come to them for posters, the Tartan’s reporters 
are not going to run after them for long articles of great 
reader interest, and probably the most important, students 
aren’t going to chase them across campus to buy a ticket 
to a dance that they never heard of until that morning.

Post Office And/Or Lost And Found
Where All Those Umbrellas Gravitate* * * *
PO Doubles As Lost and Found; 
Even Pivot Tooth Finds Niche
By Dotyy Mitchell
The Lost and Found department of Carnegie Tech could be 
more appropriately named the Curiosity Shop, for the list of lost 
items held by the department is indeed a motley assortment of
goods.
Such possessions as books, hats, 
scarves, jackets, glasses, wallets, 
pencils, are included among the 
lost articles. Elizabeth White, post 
mistress and head of the Lost and 
Found department, stated: “We 
get anything and everything. Any­
thing that isn’t attached to a stu­
dent is liable to turn up here.”
Strangest Article
In fact, Miss White recalls that 
even some things that were at­
tached to people have been lost.
The department has received en­
tire outfits of clothes. But the 
strangest article brought to the 
department has never been claim­
ed. It is a pivot tooth lost sev­
eral years ago. Another unusual 
item turned in to the department 
was a pair of tickets to g Novem­
ber 23 symphony at the Mosque.
Several times the Lostjand Found 
department has acted as an ex­
change bureau for a four party 
coat mixup where the parties 
have managed to walk off with the 
wrong coat in Skibo, at a dance, or 
fraternity house.
Offices Scattered
An entire locker is stacked high 
with lost items. Many of these ar­
ticles are valuable, yet they have 
never been claimed. Therefore,
Miss White urges students who 
have lost things to check at the 
department for them.
The central office of the Lost 
and Found department is located 
at the post office in Administra­
tion Hall. It is open 8:30 to 5 
Mondays through Fridays and 8:30
Skibo, Margaret Morrison, and 
the Gym also have lost and found 
offices. This dispersion of lost 
articles over campus is not par­
ticularly efficient or desirable. 
The combining of the separate of­
fices is now being studied and 
worked on by Alpha Phi Omega, 
to 12:30 on Saturdays. However, 
A Parting Word 
APO also holds a sale at cer­
tain specified times to clear the 
office of the scores of unclaimed 
articles and to obtain capital in 
order to carry on their servidfe 
work for the college. A parting 
word to sorrowful students who 
have lost some prized possession 
—go to Lost and Found to check 
for the item; otherwise you may 
one day find your prize on an 
APO sale counter.
Xmas Chapel 
Hears Carols, 
Cameron Clioir
The traditional Christmas 
Chapel will take place in the Fine 
Arts building at 11:30 a.m. on 
Tuesday, December 18.
A special Christmas program 
has been prepared by the Cameron 
Choir and the music department 
choral group. As usual, the audi­
ence will be given a chance to 
join in the singing of Christmas 
carols.
l*rofessor Raymond E. Parshall, 
assistant to the President of Car- 
negio Tech, will deliver the 
Christmas message. Professor 
Parshall, who is also in the English 
department, is replacing President 
Warner, who is in India.
All students and faculty are 
urged to attend this program, 
which promises to be one of the 
best of the chapel programs pre­
sented this year.
Kiltie Records
Looking for that special 
Christmas gift? Perhaps an 
album of Carnegie songs—as 
recorded by the Kiltie Band 
and the Men’s Glee Club—Is 
just the thing. The records 
are on unbreakable plastic and 
include “Dear Old Tech,” 
“Skibo,” “Fight for the Glory 
of Carnegie,” and the Alma 
Mater.
Albums, at $4.35 each, can 
be purchased at any time in 
the bookstore or during this 
next week at noontime in 
Skibo. The handsome gold 
and red album is decorated 
with many scenes of Carnegie 
campus life.

INTERNATIONAL CLUB HOLDS CHRISTMAS PARTY
CIT s International club and similar groups from other campuses 
sang carols at homes for children and the aged as a climax to a 
drive for hooks and clothes for foreign students abroad. A program 
of Christmas customs in other lands followed.
The second issue of the Scot for 
the current school year will ap­

670 On Your Dial
Campus Station Hopes To Expand 
* * * *
Campus Radio Station’s Future 
Hinges On Student Interest
By Joan Brechin
In the remotest part of CIT’s campus, the basement of Carnegie 
Union, lie the studios of WRCT, 670 on your dial (if you live in 
the dorms or Morewood Gardens!) This collegiate radio station has 
made tremendous strides since its early nutshell beginning, but its 
history is still in the making *------------------------------ ‘
All that is needed now is more 
student participation. WRCT has 
many plans for the future, but 
they hinge on one big deficiency: 
lack of people to run programs.
Some of the projects under con­
sideration are:
1. A transmitter in one of the 
fraternity houses to cover all 
the Greeks.
2. A line to the gym to broad­
cast sports events such as 
basketball games and intra­
murals.
3. A rebroadcast of programs 
from WDUQ, Duquesne Uni­
versity.
Varied Schedule
WRCT’s schedule so far consists 
of transcribed Navy, Army, and 
Treasury Department programs; 
disc jockey programs like Rege 
Cordic; just plain music; variety 
shows, such as “Twenty Ques­
tions;” and “Talk Your Way Out 
Of It” (a problem and predica­
ment program).
But if the station had a few 
more people to twiddle dials, they 
could handle such shows as “The 
Campus Vacuum Cleaner,” which 
would be a gossip column of 
Morewood Gardens; rebroadcast 
Student Council meetings and 
drama programs something like 
“In Search of the Air,” which was 
transmitted the first two weeks 
of the school year; or even con­
template bigger enterprises, such 
as school dances and the Kiltie 
Band concerts.
Expanded Operations 
WRCT used to be on the air four
nights a week, three horns a night, 
now it broadcasts five nights a 
week, five hours a night. Next 
semester it wants to schedule six 
days a week, Sunday through 
Friday. This will probably ne­
cessitate an increase in the pres­
ent station staff of 50, 20 of which

Tech Debaters 
Take Honors 
In Tournament
For the second consecutive 
week, Carnegie Tech’s debaters 
have copped top honors in a ma­
jor tournament. Competing against 
76 debaters from 19 other col­
leges in the tri-state area, CIT's 
negative team of Jay Claster and 
Ronny Curhan scored a high of 
86.5%, equaled only by two of 
Pitt’s representatives.
The tournament, held at Pitt, 
included three rounds of cross- 
examination style debating. In 
this type of contest, the opposing - 
teams direct rapid fire questions 
at each speaker when he has com­
pleted his constructive talk. More­
over, the scores were derived from 
the ratings awarded by the op­
posing team, so it took both skill 
and tact to compile a high score.
Coach R. C. Oswant*s team was 
represented on the affirmative by 
Norma Trust and Arnold Sher­
man.

School To Miss Buddy 
Overend, Athletic Boss
__ TAOTAN
Wilsonj Stahle, 
Luchok Named 
To All District
For the second straight year, 
three members of the Carnegie 
Tartan football team were named 
to All-District Class-B honors by 
the Pittsburgh Press. End Fritz 
Wilson, tackle Clyde Stahle and 
left-half back Johnny Luchok car­
ried off the first-place positions 
for the Skibos.
Fritz Wilson was the only 
man on the first string team who 
was named for the second con­
secutive year. Wilson made the 
grade last year along with Floyd 
Wiseman and Nick Simcic. Tackle 
Hans Lange was chosen to repre­
sent Carnegie on the second team.
With all the muckraking current in the sports realm, 
there has been a tendency for the public to forget the un­
spectacular benefits which result from sports. Due to the 
burst of publicity spotlighting present evils some learned 
people of our society, in all self-righteousness have even 
gone so far as to advocate complete abolition of intercollegiate 
sports as a remedy for today’s infamous situation.
Without examining the ethics of our elders, who have set 
an example for our younger generation with their good sports­
manship at athletic events, their bribe paying bets, their hurry 
to turn a fast buck, there is evidence that sports have helped 
— the young men who participate to gain some of the qualities 
which society professes, although may not practice.
At Carnegie Institute of Technology, Phi Kappa Frater­
nity annually presents the Joe Pash Trophy. In honor of 
a Carnegie athle.te named Joe Pash, it is more than a me­
morial to an athlete but also a mark of'the wholesome part 
athletics can play in a well rounded life.
A native of Pittsburgh, Joe Pash attended Carnegie Tech 
from 1939-1913 and graduated with a degree in mechanical en­
gineering. An outstanding athlete and a leader on the campus, 
Joe is remembered for something more than his ability. Noted 
for his fair play and competitive spirit, Joe gained something 
from athletics and left something with the game that other men 
can profit from in participation.
One of the last boys to receive a football scholarship at 
Carnegie before de-emphasis, Joe was a four year letterman 
and halfback on the CIT teams which played nationally 
known teams that clearly outclassed the Plaid. However, 
led by the fighting spirit and enthusiasm of Pash, the Tar­
tans managed to provide keen competition for their oppon­
ents and never took a bad beating.
Enlisting in the submarine corps after graduation, Pash went 
down on the final American submarine destroyed in World War
II. Pash, however, has stayed on at Carnegie and guys like Pash 
will continue to stay on at Carnegie and at thousands of other 
colleges in the United States where sports are played.
A Winning Year
With football and cross-country seasons completed and 
the basketball and swimming schedules well under way, 
Tartan sports fans are just beginning to realize that they 
are witnessing what may be one of Carnegie’s greatest ath­
letic seasons. Even the coaches are optimistic. Although 
they are notoriously shy about predicting winning seasons, 
the various CIT mentors haven’t looked as glum as usual 
this year, and one or two have even flatly predicted success­
ful schedules.
Although coaches Mel Cratsley of basketball and Claude 
Sofield of swimming have yet refused to make a statement, 
indications from the winning starts are that Carnegie will 
have successful seasons in both sports. It’s entirely possi­
ble that CIT may end up with winning teams in every 
sport participated in this year, if the present pace is main­
tained.

Gut Are Those Friends Pil^As?
Community Celebrates 
Over PiKA’s Loss
By Dick Durstine
To assorted local music lovers and radio announcers, the presence 
of the Pi Kappa Alpha bell has been a source of some little dis­
tress. Other groups, more particularly the owners of the instru 
ment, consider it a possession of merit. Let us now discuss this issue 
calmly and without bias. ?-----
Perpetual Enshrinement
The possible future of the bell is 
an issue which is at present in 
question. Some, such as the afore­
mentioned radio announcer, would 
no doubt approve of its use as 
foundation for a beaver damn 
someplace near the headwaters of 
the Monongahela. Others, on the 
contrary, would be happy to see 
it perpetually enshrined in the 
hallowed halls of the National Mu­
seum at Washington.
As for the PiKA’s, they would 
be satisfied just to get the con­
founded thing back. For their be­
loved bell is lost, strayed, or stolen, 
and its return is awaited anxiously.
Illustrious History
The Pi Kappa Alpha bell, cast 
from pure iron years ago in the 
Orient, is not an ordinal bell. 
Rumor has it that it helped spur 
the golden hordes of Ghengis Khan 
to the conquest of Eurasia. Others
believe it did not come into use 
until the time of a certain Gaius 
Caesar, consul of Rome.
The truth, however, which has 
never before been published out 
side the jealously guarded annals 
of the fraternity, has been gleaned 
from the mystic inscriptions on 
the bell itself. Engraved in the 
metal of the bell, but now crusted 
over by several centuries of cor-
“Present Laughter,” by the in­
ternational wit, composer, and 
playwright Noel Soward tells the 
story of a famous actor who is 
quite unhappily, passing into mid­
dle age. He spends most of his 
time, with tlie help of his friends, 
trying to handle the steady stream 
of women that fall in love with 
him.
Although “Present Laughter” 
will officially open its run on Sat­
urday, December 8th, the Play­
house is opening its doors on 
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs­
day of this week for public pre­
view performances. Anyone de­
siring to attend a preview of 
“Present Laughter” may obtajft 
tickets by calling the Playhouse,

“Le livrerosion, lie the words “Le livre est

But the present 400 pound mon­
ster is only one in a series of 
PiKA bells, which have rung at 
various and sundry times during 
the ages.
Most recent of the possessions of

brass bell, and a large iron one. 
The former is now immortalized 
in the linen closet at 5010 More-

since fallen into oblivion.

Report Shows Students 
Behind Social Program
At the Istudent Council Meeting held Sunday, Dec. 2, a general 
report was given by Bill Bartoli, concerning the results of the two 
social affairs held this semester by Council. The reports were very 
encouraging. It seems that the Evening Students are really behind 
Council this year. *

for the run down the home stretch 
of the first semester. It is a good 
time to get caught up or even plan

forget to relax!
Since this is the last issue of 
the Plaid this year, we the staff 
take this opportunity to wish you 
all a -Merry Xmas and a Happy

Correction I
A little confusion has arisen 
as to the beginning of the 
Xmas recess. The Evening 
Student Carnegie Handbook 
states Tuesday, December 18, 
at 5:30 as dismissal, while the 
Official Calendar in A. H. 
states Wednesday, December 
19, at 5:30. The correct date is 
Wednesday, December 19, at 
5:30, i.e. No school that Wed­
nesday night.

was fortunate in obtaining the 
services of the Westinghouse 
Quartet, one of the top singing 
groups in the country. These four 
men spend a full day at their jobs, 
but their evenings and weekends 
are spent miles from home lend­
ing their unique harmony, singing 
style, and showmanship to ban­
quets, smokers, lodge meetings, 
or wherever people might gather 
to enjoy good singing.
The Quartet is a member in 
good standing of the S.P.E.B.S.Q. 
SA. Their schedule is a crowded 
one, and since they are booked as 
far as eight months in advance, 
we are indeed fortunate in getting 
their services. Beside singing se­
lections of their own, the Quartet 
will lead the entire group in carol 
singing.
Father Berkmyre, Carnegie 
Tech chaplain, will give an ap­
propriate 'Christmas message, as 
well as the benediction.
Classes have been rescheduled 
so that classes which normally run 
until 8:30 will be dismissed at 8:00 
p.m. Those classes which extend 
through to 10 or 10:30 p.m. will 
be interrupted for 50 minutes, 
while those classes which norm­
ally convene at 8:30 p.m. will not 
meet until 8:50 p.m.
A large group of Evening School 
students enjoyed a similar pro­
gram last year. It is hoped that 
all the newcomers will avail 
themselves of this opportunity te 
join with their fellow students in 
this expression of the spirit oi

to student participation in the 
station, Student Council gave it 
activity points on a par with the 
Tartan and Technical. Students 
are also encouraged to submit sug­
gestions in mail box 411.
Funds a Problem 
Obtaining adequate funds for 
its proper functioning is another 
big problem that faces the station 
personnel. The running expenses 
are not high, but the building of 
equipment, such as microphones 
and portable controls, entails get­
ting more appropriations. If 
WRCT can secure more funds, 
along with more student partici­
pation, it can probably complete 
its plans and also expand on them.
Sororities
All upperclass girls, juniors 
and seniors, who are interested 
in joining a sorority should 
sign up in Dean Schaeffer’s of­
fice before December 19.
