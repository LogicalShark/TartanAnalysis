April 6 at midnight will be a big time for that old denizen of the 
field house, one Baron Munhall, for on that particular date he will re­
turn to his old occupation. His highness is pictured above in a very 
representative pose with a keg of Health Water.
Baron Munhall made the following statement to a large corps of 
newspapermen assembled at his favorite bed in the Bachelors’ Club: 
“It is with extreme regret that I find myself forced to make this 
decision. For generations the Munhalls have carried on this noble 
tradition, and I think it would be disloyal to give it up now.”
Above is pictured the symbol of 
the new deal. The Tartan staff ad­
vocates this new deal. We are for 
this new deal. There has never 
before been anything quite like the 
new deal. We sponsor a new deal 
for a new era. A new deal'is what 
the students want and that Is what 
we will give them.

Hearty cheers filled the air as faculty members and a special re­
ception committee of school-spirited stud.ents greeted the first truck 
load of prunes as it left the prunery'for the Carnegie campus. If one 
will look closely he can see the look of anticipation and desire in the 
eyes of the onlookers.
Hiding behind the wagon is Doctor Griffiss. The forlorn look on 
his face was caused by his disappointment at not being named as a 
member of the committee. He is trying to hide his grief behind the 
wagon.
The committee, from left to right, is composed of H. Hower and 
Sons, William H. McKenna, J. Lee Lentz, Jr., an unidentified youth, 
and Emil G. Stankey.

Five members of the Department of Mathematics holding doctor's 
degrees are engaged in a study of the pretzel, under commission of. 
the American Pretzel Company. The study will include a derivation of 
the equation of the pretzel and suggestions for the improvement, 
through use of a. new equation, of the salted biscuit.
Professor Geckeler, head of the department, said: “This is the
most engrossing problem we have yet been called upon to solve. Some 
surprising conclusions are seen. In fact, it would not be surprising to 
see the entire pretzel industry shaken to its core by our findings."

2THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1933
Tartan Pledges “New Deal;” 
Scraps Conservative Policy
A »weeping change In the edl- 
ltorlal policy of the Tartan waa 
announced yesterday by the Tartan 
staff. The change Is effective with 
thin Ibbuo.
Editor Ladd «aid: "We are
giving the paper back to the Btu- 
dentn. Reader» have not appre­
ciated our effort« to publish a con­
servative and refined journal and 
since our policy must be dlctatod 
by the wishes of the majority of 
our readers, a change must be 
made."
The Tartan will hereafter be Is­
sued in tabloid form with pictures 
predominating. The uso of pic­
tures to tell the story Is hi vogue
In tabloids In New York and Chica­
go. "Picture« don’t lie," gesticulat­
ed Betty Preller and Dolly Allison, 
managing and news editors of the 
Tartan.
Campus leaders were meeting
oarly today to consider possible 
developments affecting their posi­
tions.
Skeletons in many campus
closets are to bo drugged forth it 
was learned from an authoritative 
source. Secrets-of-stato, supposed­
ly immuno to public gaze, are to 
be exposed. Disclosures of cor­
ruption in many high campus posts 
are expected shortly.
The Tartan will challenge the
right to existence of every organi­
zation on the campus. The demise 
of many honorary groups is fore­
cast.
Believing that readers are in­
terested in the activities of their 
neighbors, the Tartan will scru­
tinize the private lives of members 
of the student body and faculty 
and will not heatitate to reveal 
facts, however sordid, where it ia 
believed the Intereat of readers 
warrant, "pur readers must* be 
pleased,” choused the staff In uni­
son.
An investigation of campus and 
fraternity politics is expected to 
come with the “new deal.”
Carnegie Forms Plans
To Ereet Biergarten
Plans for a campus “biergarten” 
were being puahed today by a com­
mittee headed by Deans Tarbell 
and Green.
"Wo will not be caught napping 
when beer returns,” said Dean 
Tarbell yesterday. Carnegie will 
bo ready for its return. Present 
plans call for the "biergarten” to 
be located In the corridor of tlio 
College of Fine Arts.”
Doan Green was enthusiastic. 
"The students have waited a Iona 
time for this, and we are doing.
everything possible to speed tlio 
return of beer. I look forward to 
the nights when Carnegie students, 
two by two, will gather for a stein 
of the good old brew, and join in 
a song or two before retiring. We 
shall certainly see a better cam­
pus spirit.”
Glendenning Keeble, Dean of the 
College of Fine Arts, and a hearty 
sponsor of the "biergarten” project, 
has been appointed by the commit­
tee to arrange for the construction 
and installation of a booth and ac­
cessory equipment for serving the
beer. Regular concessions will be 
sold to students who apply
promptly with creditable reference.
Frank Orbin, until yesterday 
business manager of Carnegie, 
who was recently appointed Coni- 
misisoner of Breweries in Alle­
gheny County will officially sample 
all beer issued to patrons of the 
"biergarten.” Another duty which 
he will assume will be that of 
greeting guests as they drop in for 
a stein or two. Orbin, whose pic­
tures appears on page one, will of­
ficiate at the opening ceremonies.
CUT WHOOPEE IN
SPRING CARNIVAL
Plans for the Spring Carnival 
wore announced by tlio Carnival 
committee and approved by Stu­
dent Council at a meeting held last 
Tuesday. The program has been 
radically changed in comparison 
with former carnivals. "It Is the 
volco of the student body, “declar­
ed James Fergus, chairman of tho 
committee. "They have long want­
ed a program quiet and pure in 
nature. The whoopee type of pro­
gram has seen its day.”
Tho festivities will open on 
Thursday morning, May 11, with a 
round-the-May Pole frolic to take 
place on tho cut. All students will 
participate. Thursday afternoon 
will bo Reading Afternoon. The 
hut will bo stacked with tho best 
available books with which tho 
studonta may busy themselves. An 
old-l'ashlonod potato roast lu the 
Bowl will bo tho event of tho even­
ing. Frankfurters and potatoes 
will bo salted, roasted over open 
flros, and oaten.
Friday morning tho program will 
ho hold In tho Open, Air Thoator
where a series of debates and elo­
quent speeches on world affairs 
will bo presented by honor stu­
dents. The afternoon will bo 
termed General Fun Afternoon 
with a bevy of games of peanut 
pushing, volley ball, and horseshoe 
pitching taking placo in the gym­
nasium and the Bowl. Knitting and 
sewing will be the sport in Mar­
garet Morrison. Friday evening 
a Virginia Reel will be held in the 
Gymnusium and Thistle Hall from

Saturday the closing date of the 
Carnival, a spoiling bee between 
tho College of Fine Arts and the 
College of Engineering will be

rangle. Tlio winners will receive 
blue ribbons and a set of silver 
salt shakers. Tho Carnival will 
close Saturday afternoon with a 
taffy pull on the cut between tho 
sophomore and tho junior classes.
Because of tho saving in pro­
gram expense, tho tickets for tho 
entire three days of tho Carnival 
will be reduced to $.fiQ a couplo.

HELPING RAND PARTY DISLIKES LODGING I DORMITORIES
The Executive board voted last 
Friday to allow the Helping Hand 
delegation quartered In Welch 
Hall to return to the societies lodg­
ing house downtown on Water 
Street.
"The dormitories, they are punk,” 
declared Hans Mason a member of 
the Helping Hand delegation in 
presenting the delegations com­
plaints before the Executive Board. 
The beds, hard as bricks, they 
pain the back. Why don’t you scrap 
’em?
Chapel To Be 
Staged As 
Revival
A special chapel program will be 
held today at 12:30 in the Little 
Theater of the College of Fine 
Arts. Pop Utecli, newly appointed 
assistant dean of men, will lead a 
revival meeting which will feature 
an address by John C. Martin, tes­
timonials by members of the facul­
ty, and appropriate music before, 
during, and following the program. 
It Is felt that, since there has 
been a great decrease in the at­
tendance at Chapel, a revival Is 
quite in order and will undoubt­
edly serve to inspire students and 
faculty to attend future Chapels.
Interesting testimonials are be­
ing prepared by the Sclmiters 
for Mr. Rollln V. Davis; Max 
Sclioen; Allan Bright,_ Registrar; 
and Miss A. Christine McBride, 
tlio latter a special giiest pro-tem 
of. the revivalist committee, which 
consists of Dr. Baker and Dr. Wat­
kins, Administration Hall, and 
Margaret Morrison College.
Music for the revival service 
will be furnished by Edward Yolie, 
organist, who will play selections 
from "Of Tlioo I Sing,” closing 
the program with "I Ain’t Got No­
body.”
Members of the committee for 
Carrying Out Revival Victims aro 
asked to meet backstage promptly 
at 12:34.
ElTUITION PAYMENT WITR WHEAT
Through the efforts of the Stu­
dent Help Department a new plan 
has been devised whereby the 
.students may pay their tuition in 
wheat instead of cash. "Wheat,” 
says John Beatty, chairman of 
the eommittoe, "can bo readily 
turned, to dough.”
Wheat is not the only commod­
ity that will be accepted in place 
of tuition. Cattle, chickens, and 
other useful animals will be ac­
cepted as well. A platform will 
be erected in front of the Admin­
istration Building Avhere such 
things as wheat may be unloaded 
and a barn will be built in the 
place now occupied by the Com­
mons. The committee wishes to 
warn students, however, that such 
things as home made fudge, hand- 
colored lamp shades, and hem­
stitched handkerchiefs will not be 
accepted.
The four Marx brothers, Zeppo, 
Harpo, Groucho, and Clilco, have 
been secured through the courtesy 
of the National Burial Casket Com­
pany and the Columbia Broadcast­
ing Company with whom they are 
now under contract, to feature at 
a humorous General Assembly to 
be lield at the Carnegie Music 
Hall'at 11:30 this morning. In ad­
dition to the four Marx Brothers, 
there Is a possibility, according to 
the Assembly committee, that 
Harry Lauder, famed humorous 
Scotsman who is making his 
thirtieth farewell tour of the 
United States, will appear for a 
few minutes at the assembly.
Prominent members of Carne­
gie’s personnel commenting on the 
array o,f talent that will be present 
at tho assembly expressed tliem-
selves as follows: Dr. Baker, "A
remarkable program.” Dean Green 
"I'm sure the house will be filled.” 
Director Jones, "I hope they are 
good.” Professon Leighon, "I 
think I’ll go.” Mr. Davis, "We'il 
have to pull a stunt like tlfis at 
chapels.”
All classes will be suspended at 
11:30 and the students will march 
in a body to the Music Hall. Fresh­
men will assemble in front of the 
Administration Building at 11:20 
wliero they will be met by the 
Kiltie band and the R. O. T. C. 
Army students are asked by the 
Assembly committee to wear their 
uniforms. Any other students de­
siring to march can fall in behind 
the freshmen.
Seats will be reserved for honor s 
roll students.
A Grad On Way 
To Burial Ground
At its last meeting, the Educa­
tional Sedate voted unanimously to 
abolish the A, the highest grade in 
the marking system at Carnegie. 
B, C, D, F, R, and I will be the 
only . grades used beginning April 
9. This decision was made follow­
ing the remark by Mr. Arista E. 
Fisher that no Carnegie student is 
perfect.
A new arrangement of quality 
points has been planned by Prof. 
Glen U. Cleeton, head of the De­
partment of Industrial Education. 
The value of the quality points lias 
been inflated so as to give psycho­
logical encouragement to the stu­
dents. A list of the grades and
their equivalent quality points fol­
lows :

"It is a truly deplorable situa­
tion,” said Dr. Ihrig. I favor the
complete elimination of both A and
B grades. Connivance exists some­
where and we intend to ferret it 
out. Students making the honor 
roll should be looked upon with 
suspicion and shunned by their 
companions. I urge ostracizing of 
all honor students. Only in that - t 
way will the world be made safe' 
for the average man.”

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1933
Forty members o£ the Tartan 
staff are today studying farm 
problems in the vicinity of Punx- 
c sutawney, Pa,
The decision to make the study 
today was made only last night by 
r John W. Ladd, editor-in-chief. Re- 
• porters gathered at the Wabash 
station at midnight last night in 
- response to’ a call from the editor ; 
v <. and departed on a special train. 
Thei*- destination was unknown 
until' Today.____________________________
L WILL CLOSE FI
An apt remark comes from a 
Boston College columnist and orig­
inally from II. W. Van Loon: “If 
the depression lasts another threo 
months everybody will think it was 
written by Eugene O'Neill.”
NEXT FRIDAY
Mr. Ladd before boarding the 
train last night said: “The «acute
distress of the farmers demands 
immediate action. Delay would 
probably be disastrous. We regret 
that we will not be on the campus 
when the regular issue of the Tar­
tan appears tomorrow, but we be­
lieve that our first duty is to our 
country.”
Arrangements were being made 
to provide police escort for the re­
turn scribes in recognition of their 
fine service. •_________________________
ager of athletics, said: “Future
generations, seeing only a long line 
of basketball reverses at the hands 
of Pitt, may forget that Carnegie 
won a game in 1927. Won by a 
one-point margin, to be sure, but 
still victory. It will therefore^ be 
the duty of the committee to pre­
serve records of the game. A 
search is being instituted for eye­
witnesses of the game whose ac­
counts will be added to the records. 
The committee will also endeavor 
to have the occasion declared an 
official school holiday.”
All those who saw the Pitt, game 
in 1927 and are still alive or those 
having friends who saw the game 
if they will report" to the field 
house will receive a ticket to the 
Carnegie-Southern California game 
next year.
“Carnegie must close its doors,” 
was the opening part of Chairman 
S. H. Church’s speech that brought 
the Carnegie trustees to their feet 
and caused them to demand ex­
planations a'e a meeting of the 
board held last night in the Stu­
dent Council office. Air. Church 
explained that the funds the board 
has withdrawn before the bank 
moratorium were, lost and as a re­
sult the interest, payment of the- 
?40,000,000 mortgage on the school, 
defaulted last September and 
again last Thursday, could not be 
met. As this was the second de­
fault and as future payments seem­
ed impossible the only recourse 
the trustees could see after the ex­
planation was to close thes school 
and sell all buildings and equip­
ment.
Students, according to the Board 
of Trustees, positively will not re­
ceive any return, of their tuition 
payment. ' “It’s their tough luck,” 
exclaimed one of the board mem­
bers last night when the subject 
was brought up.
The last class at Carnegie will 
be held Friday at 5:30. After that 
time the doors will be closed and 
students and faculty will be forbid 
further access to the campus. 
M.arks arid credits will not be 
transferred for students because 
of the added expense this opera­
tion would incur.
A series of debates at M.cGill 
University has resulted in the con­
clusion that a long kiss Is con­
ducive to greater bliss than Is a 
short kiss.
Record of Pitt 
Court Victory 
Will Be Kept
=. Committee Appointed To 
Preserve Facts
The Carnegie Athletic Council 
at a meeting last night appointed a 
committee to gather and preserve 
records of the Carnegie victory 
over Pitt in basketball during the 
1927 season. “

Tartan’s Annual Scandal Issue
Once again the Tartan staff, in a carefrcc manner, turns to 
its annual scandal number, which has been a regular issue on 
the Tuesday nearest to April 1 for tlie past four years. Evcrp- 
t-hing appearing in this issue is fictitious and. is presented en­
tirely for its entertainment value and not as personal affronts 
or ridicule. »Statements'supposedly made by certain individuals 
are not to be attributed to them, nor arc any oJ: the remarks 
made about them to be oonnnccted in any way with these people 
who in normal times demand the respect of tin; student body. 
It is hoped thal all of the people who arc mentioned will receive 
this issue good naturedly. Thanks are due the Post-Gazette and 
Sun-Telcgraph for their co-operation in furnishing cuts and pictures.

The'price of eggs, we note, has 
fallen to a poultry twenty cents 
per dozen. I-Iow this will affect the 
roost of the wprld is definitely un­
certain, but if the eggs were duck 
oggs we could say there would be 
a quack reaotion among foreign 
food fanciers. When the egg situa­

to use a hashed metaphor, the sit­

This idea of splitting up a two or 
three hundred year job into two- 
bit allotments was old when Nebu­
chadnezzar was cropping grass on 
the Arabian plains. Of course it 
Isn’t peasant for the common peo­
ple, but it serfs them right. We 
would quote some of their opinions, 
but we don't want to be Volga.

to do, and if they rebel, he takes

Much grief is doubtless felt by 
the Oliinoso because of the magni­
tude of their private rebellion. 
They must wash their dirty linen 
In public. For n nation so plenti­
fully supplied with laiindrymon 
such' a delicate sensibility is ridic­
ulous. They should be more con­
cerned with their neighbors who 
are Nippon away at their territory, 
a procedure which suspiciously re­
sembles an act of aggression.
PLAY REVIEW
Darling (Joorgo:
I don’t blnmo you In a way for 
going off niad I his afternoon, but 
really you didn’t give me a chance 
to oxpluln. You know deep down 
In your honrt that that nice little 
blond architect that taken tickets 
at the Little Theater doesn't moan 
a thing to me. I should think that, 
•after you had tried for the four 
years you wore hero to got tickets 
to one of tlio plays, you wouldn’t 
blamo me so much for weedllng 
my way In Just once before I grad­
uate.
And It was simply immense, 
George! You know how I always 
oggled at all the Dramatis when we'd 
pass their table in the Beanery un­
til I knew their faces as well as I 
do yours. Almost as well, any­
how. Sometimes 1 think 1 could 
act, too, George. Would you mind 
terribly, terribly much if l was to 
go on the stage? I wouldn’t let 
my career wreck our home life like 
so many other silly girls do. Of 
course, some things we talked 
about we’d have to leave go until 
later, but you wouldn’t mind, would 
you, George?
I almost forgot what I started to 
tell you about! "The Farmer's
Wife" was the name of the play 1 
saw, and you know It was awfully 
dumb of 1110, but I was sort of ex­
pecting ail entirely different kind 
of a play—It was really quite nice, 
and awfully funny, too. it was 
directed by that tall, dark man 1 
pointed out to you In the.,Beanery, 
Mr. Hickman.
I'm off on another'track again, 
but you know how rattled It makes 
mo when we quarrel, George. The 
story of the play told about how a 
farmer whose name was Sweet- 
land hunted all over to find an­
other wife, I guess his first one 
must have died because there 
wasn’t room enough in the same 
house for her and his head. too. 
he was so stuck on himself. I hate 
men like that, George. Anyhow, It 
made me feel good to see them one 
by one turning him down cold, 
though I do wish that just for pun­
ishment he’d have been accepted 
by that Thirza Tapper-woman.
In the last act, old wooden-legs 
discovers that he’d been hunting 
all over for the diamond that had 
been buried in his own back yard 
all along. Of course, I’m only talk­
ing figuratively now. George, be­
cause 1 mean that the diamond

SPRING SOCIAL SCOOP
Dragons, scholastic honorary for

Mortar Board, women’s auxiliary 
for repeal of prohibition, at a din­
ner party in the Pittsburgh Field 
Club on Saturday evening, April 
first. Mr. "Cactus" Kuhn, social 
chairlady of the Dragon organiza­
tion, acted in his usual capacity of 
chief handy man. He was ably 
assisted by Mr. "Carideo” Coulter 
who looked a trifle fagged after the 
conclusion of the recent boxing 
soason for which he was "OUT.” 
Lady M.orse, the M.B’s bouncing 
pride and joy, was permitted the 
questionable honor of sitting be­
tween Mr. Coulter and Mr. Kuhn 
neither of whom have spoken to 
each other since. Chimpy Lentz, 
president of the Gorilla Association 
For Improvement of Living Condi­
tions in. Zoological Gardens, 
escorted the proud and happy, Lady 
Brierly. Robly Robinson left 
his warm fireside for the 
evening in favor of Gough- 
drops, and Jimmy Stahl who brags 
that "I-Ie’s too tough to make’’ at­
tended the dinner with the daugh­
ter of the E. E. Dept. Head, little 
Alice Work. The remaining mem­
bers of both organizations were 
dragged from under the table in 
time for nine-thirty classes on 
April fourth.

dioso zebra stripes, and Mrs. P.
carried a dainty, parasol to guard 
her "youthful" complexion. But 
the thrill of the evening was Otto 
T’s failure to qualify In the trial 
heats and the necessity for Mr. 
Moses fishing him out from the 
shallow end. Mr. Fisher who 
boasts of his Gothic chin en­
gineered the difficult feat very 
adeptly. Harriet Glendon, playing 
the role of just another "bathing 
beauty” refused to remove her 
stockings for fear of catching cold. 
Doctor Work climaxed the evening 
by chasing Mabel Trilling around 
tlie turf until she ran screaming 
into the fish-pond nearby and was 
playfully ducked by that austere 
gentleman who held her dpwn until 
she blew a sufficient quantity of 
bubbles. Dr. Harold Lang spent 
the entire evening searching for 
foreign bacillus In the pool water.* • * *

Dear Mr. Editor:
I am sending yon this little note

and tired of your lousy paper with 
its uninteresting articles, its. bum

Unless I see a marked improve­
ment I am going to start a petition 
for the suspension of the paper 
which everybody over here in the 
Arts School will sign. ^

that one can really get tickets if

BEFORE WE GET ON WITH 
THE REGULAR BUSINESS OF 
THE DAY it seems fitting, and 
proper that we should hand out a 
little dirt about our fellow scribe 
“From the Fence’' (?) By the 
way he is one of the star athletes 
of a cup snatching basketball team. 
Anyway Mr. X has been running 
around with or after Miss Audrey 
Kelley (pronounced Audray Kel- 
lay) of the drama department. It 
seems as if one day last week Miss 
Kelley came to school with a black 
eye and said Mr. X appeared the 
same day with a skinned up 
knuckle. A coincidence, what?
YOU KNOW THERE HAS 
BEEN SOME' WELL FOUNDED 
RUMORS in the Athletic circles 
that Howard I-Iarpster has told 
Buddy Overend that he will not 
coach here next year because he 
has found out that .many of the 
football players are here on scliol- 
•arships. But before I discuss that 
situation, I want to say that now 
that beer is back and probably 
hard liquors too, I have just gotten 
out of safe keeping a bottle of good 
old rye that I’ve had in stock for 
quite some time, and have been 
saving for just such an occasion as 
this. This thing of legislating 
against morals is entirely wrong. 
What possible barm can I do-any- 
one by perhaps by taking a drink 
or two of this inspiring fluid in-the 
privacy of my room? I can have 
a drink or so and remain entirely 
sober—the fact is 1 will take one 
little sup. My but it is good and 
doesn’t affect me a bit. Now to the 
story.
Horatio Algier Harpster is one 
of the best athletes this school has 
ever turned out. To help the 
thought process I believe I'll have 
another little drink. Ah, that one 
was better than the first—and I'm 
sobre and hurting no one. Well as
I was saying, Coward Harpster 
was brought here so that the play­
ers could be bought (I missed the 
key, I mean taught) . to play for 
Carnegie Reck. Ah, that bottle 
lool^ so tempting, I’m inclined to 
take*.another little sup. I got a lit­
tle more than I intended that time, 
but I’m hnrting.no one and perfect­
ly sobre so why shouldn’t I.
Where was I? Oh, yes. The 
reason that Karpster wax signed 
up is because he and Muddy Over­
end have always been pals. What 
do you think of that. Just one 
more little drink and I’ll put. that 
bottle-away I bromise you. This 
thing of saying that liquor hurts

The Kappa Sigs and the Betas 
fought it out for the basketball 
championship last Wednesday 
night in the Carnegie emporium of 
sports. Originally scheduled as a 
basketball contest,- one of the 
Kappa Sig rooters must have been 
forewarned and came with his girl 
attired in formal dress. Kay Burns 
took the count in the second round 
after receiving a neat left hook 
from Stewart. Occasional some­
one would remember that it was 
scheduled as a basketball game 
and try for the basket, but this 
could not have been very often for 
the final score was 13-12. • The 
knockout by the Betas balancing 
the score in their favor.
The football squad contributed 
heavily to the battle by entering 
four men, and as usual they played 
like a bunch of amateurs. For 
once ineligibility did not limit their 
activities.
The officials have now all retired 
and bought beautiful homes with 
the money collected. We under­
stand that they are considering a 
reduction in rates for next year 
lowering the charges to 40 cents 
for each foul called or .$5.00 for 
the whole game thrown. The 
Betas were able to scrape up only 
enough dough to . win by one point 
in the final game.
A new influx to the dorms was 
decidedly evident as various houses 
finished the basketball season. 
Some houses having as many as 
three good players who found it 
necessary to drop their affiliations 
as the fraternities found that thejr 
could not maintain them free of 
charge when they were not playing 
ball. However, they were all 
dropped with the assurance that 
they will be among the boys next 
year.
JAGNOW CHOSEN 
COURT CAPTAIN
A nasty and persistant rumor 
has been going around the Campus 
that Lou Jagnow has been elected 
captain of next year’s basketball 
team. As young Jagnow has long 
been famous as a handshaker 
deluxe, it is quite possible that 
some truth exists to the tale.
Jagnow broke into a few games 
last season but starred in only one 
affair—a game that was played on 
a waxed floor which had been used 
for dancing the night before.
This space reserved for cut of 
Capt. Jagnow.
Harpster Quits Grid Post 
After Foundation’s Report
The climax of a startling investi­
gation and expose by the Carnegie 
Foundation came last night when 
Howard Harpster, Carnegie’s re­
cently appointed coach and former 
All-City quarterback for the Tar­
tans, turned in his resignation. 
The investigation, which is being 
conducted in conjunction with a 
general betterment program that 
also includes readjustment in such 
similarly corrupt vice rings as the 
Mathematics department, came to 
a head when the Foundation’s- re­
port was published and the facts 
revealed.
It was shown that Carnegie 
scouts have deliberately combed 
the slums of the world for rough­
necks and thugs to represent the 
fair name of Carnegie on the grid­
iron. Flag-stop towns like Lorain 
and Middletown, Ohio, Irwin, Pa., 
and others have all yielded their 
share of the rabble. And yet, as' 
shown by the report, these hood­
lums live like kings, drive big cars 
around and in general place them­
selves above their fellow students.
Coach Harpster said in resign­
ing, “It isn’t so bad when the play­
ers get more money than the pro­
fessors but when they get more 
tha the coach it’s time something 
were done. Things aren’t like they 
were when I went to college,” con­
tinued "the old sage. “I’ll ever for­
get the time we hitch-hiked to 
South Bend and beat the Irish. 
Our team that year had real spirit. 
Why can’t the players be like that?
The report also climaxes a stu­
dent protest that such rowdies as 
“Bone-Crusher” Stewartoski should 
not be allowed to play with the 
nicer boys on the campus. Stewart­
oski, along with Forsmanoodle, the 
big eskimo tackle; Kavalovitch, 
the famous little Jesuit halfback 
and “Chin” Coulter, Plaid playboy 
will all be forced to give up their 
apartments and take enormous

THIS sort of thing has gone too

Let’s take action at once. Get him

We all knowr a pipe smooths out the

smoking tobacco goes best in a good

Next time you “cram” for an exam,

man, Dr. Moonhaul, who has also 
been deep in Carnegie corruption, 
refuses to talk until he has his 
lawyer. When asked what he 
thought of 3.2 per cent beer, Dr. 
Moonhaul made a wry face but 
continued silent.
Two more of Carnegie’s Russian 
fridders, Croff and Heinsneer were 
approached by reporters who only 
spoke English, so little was learned 
from this source. Carnegie’s fa­
mous papoose, Beveveedol, whoso 
father is a big oil mail from Okla­
homa, threatens to go back to the 
reservation if things don’t quiet 
down soon. The dashing Spaniard, 
O’Burzio from Jeannette, also from 
Alice, Jane and Susie, rebelled at 
the clause in the report which de­
es that all athletes must stay 
in at least one night a week.
And so it stands today. All is 
chaos and disorder in Carnegie 
athletics. Howeyer, as one modest 
red-lieaded player said, “Go ahead 
and give football back to the stu­
dents. I don’t care whether I (ill 
the Stadium again anyway.’’ This 
attitude denotes dissention so per­
haps the investigation is all for the 
best.
TARTAN TO OPEN GRID 
SEASON WITH VASSAR ON 
OCTOBER 1 AT STADIUM
By THE DEACON
After many months of anxious 
waiting, the public has at last beon 
enlightened as to the complete 
schedule of next year’s varsity 
football team. The long delay was 
due to the fact that Mr. Overend. 
after viewing last season’s Geneva- 
Carnegie game, could not find a 
setup that his cohorts were abso­
lutely sure of beating.
Following long negotiations and 
the spending of a great deal of 
the A. A.’s waning capital in tele­
grams, Buddy has announced that 
he has secured Vassar for the 
opener. Even Gil Dobie of Cornell 
would class this team as a push­
over, so the boys are looking for­
ward to at least one victory liext 
fall.
The remainder of the schedule 
follows:
October S—California Normal at 
Stadium.
October 15—Sclienley High in 
104 Industries.
October 22—The Betas’ Basket­
ball team in Motor Square Garden.
November 5—Pitt Freshmen in 
the T. X’s back yard.
November 12—The Dragons In

SCHENLEY HOLLOW, April 
(?) (UZ)—While driving across
the cut one* Sunday afternoon in 
the middle of the week, a number 
of night students were observed to 
have taken a short cut to reach 
the registrar's office for official in­
spection of carbo-noxus to deter­
mine whether the correct type of 
fluid "yiras inserted in the elongated 
tube which holds the center line of 
a thermometer when placed per­
pendicular to an adjacent research 
lab.
The particular night students 
were so absorbed in the pertinent 
question that they failed to ob­
serve the approach of Fritz the 
Farmer coming at rightangles to 
I he bill boards and the Senior 
Fence.
As a consequence there was a 
mixup of green goods and liquid 
goods (gasoline) on Frew street 
which created an uproar in the 
vicinity of the Coal Research Lab 
located In the hollow subterraneous 
to the Science building.
An explosion occurred when the 
two gasses (parls green and inter­
lube—a trade name for liquid com­
bustion fluid) became Ignited 
which shook all the dust from the 
rafters of the now defunct rifle 
range on tlio garret of the Fine 
Arts Building.
So terrifld was tlio explosion that 
all the Instructors of tlio English 
department doclnred a moratorium 
on split infinitives and disjointed 
conjunctions. This moratorium 
was so elTectlvo tluit . . .
A search party was organized to 
locate the correct spot whoro Fritz

Councilmen
••Shoutings of vituperation and 
pusslllanlmity shattered the omi­
nous silence and dignified atmos­
phere of the council room recently, 
as Molga Exenobia Fulig, vocifer­
ous A and P, also reigning council 
sweetheart, threatened to bring 
down the administration upon an 
ignominious council operator, whom 
she loquaciously accused of trying 
on her new satin lined, patent 
dressed, suede baseball gloves, and 
of speaking about these gloves in 
terms of animadversion.
Fear fired the hearts of men 
(most of it uncalled for) as this 
fem prestidgitator, who only a 
moment before was the perfect 
symbol and paragon of virtue, as 
lovely as a pale plnlc hyacinth 
with a grace beyond the reach of 
art, (coma) suddenly changed into 
a vicious amazon, full of sound and 
fury.
Chaos and destruction followed 
In the wake of her unscheduled 
orruptlon of gargantuan outpour­
ings. Strong men like Mjlchaney 
and Blekarl swooned under the 
.fusilade of poisonous verbal darts, 
and sought refuge behind a pair of 
glasses and a typewriter respec­
tively. Steel desks were brought 
in for the others to hide behind.

of law-malclng powers, alone re­
fused to condescend to a mere 
Amazon, and bravely withstood the

At last dear old Tech has won 
a place In the sun. Announcement 
by the directors of the Internation­
al Ashcarriers Union, that the In­
ternational Art exhibition this 
year is to lie held in the spacious 
exhibition room of the College of 
Fine Arts, caused great rejoicing 
in the ranks of unemployed wine 
tasters.
Numerous experiments with the 
aesthetic elements, and methodical 
investigations into the physiologi­
cal psychology of aesthetic reac­
tions, attest to the truth of the 
afore mentioned facts.
According to the general laws of 
literary metapliorosis, if the horse 
of the Eocene age is inferior to 
the horse of today, it Is because it 
is less horse-llke, this despite the 
fact that beauty is an abstract 
quality.A metaphysical definition must 
set forth what beauty Is and what 
II serves In the universe, conse­
quently who shall decide which is 
more liorse-like, the original or the 
latter development.
Fine tastes do not descend to us, 
hence the clear distinction between 
these effects, and the Implicit or 
suggestive, rather than the ex­
plicit and arbitrary effects upon 
the emotions.The appreciative critic should 
consider a work of art in its 
psychological origin as a delicately 
transparent illustration of aesthetic 
law. Therefore, sad is the woman’s 
plight z.cafl physically fitted to pro­
duce a certain physiological result 
in the imagination, year by year, 
sees one by one her beauties dis­
appear. ________ ____

his report by diagnosing her ail­

known as inamorata, and suggested 
the use of an undersized fair jacket.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, APRIL 4. 19337
OUR ALTech’s Champion Card
Sharks Contest Title
Before one of the greatest crowds 
ever assombled in the field house, 
Carnegie’s entry in the great 150 
rubber bridge match for the 
world's championship came through 
in glorious style. That is, they 
would have come through nobly, 
but they turned up without the 
cards, and the match had to be 
cancelled.
Carnegie’s entry was the invin­
cible combination of Hannum and 
Irwin, two strong lads .who talk a 
:good game in any league. They 
were opposed by Messrs. Culbert­
son and Sims, but these famous 
names could not daunt A1 and Max.
Mr. Irwin and Mr. Hannum at­
tribute their unprecedented suc­
cess to their new system of bidding 
known popularly as the “One-under- 
the-table” system. Of the artificial
bids employed, the following are 
the most effective: one kick—take 
out demand; two"kicks—bid game, 
or else.
On Thursday, the two teams 
finally came together, when A1 bor­
rowed four decks of cards from the 
Delt house, who have no use for 
them since they dropped out of 
interfraternity competition. For a. 
while the game was quite spirited. 
Mi-. Irwin opened the bidding with 
a psychic two blue chip call, but 
his partner took him out with a 
black jack. At this point M^*. Cul­
bertson called the police.
In spite of then* remarkable 
ability to win tournament bridge 
it is noised about the campus that 
this pair was beaten by Messrs. 
Fergus and Stentz in a little so­
ciable game a short time ago.

Leap-frog season will open this 
week with noon practices in the 
Grill and Commons frbrn 11:30 to 
•1:30. Mrs. Blacklock and Mr. 
Miller will act as referees and will 
award oysterettes and miniature 
bottles of cream to all who last 
throughout the afternoon.
The jig-saw puzzle tournament 
between Dormitory girls will con­
tinue in the basement of Forbes 
Hall every niglit this week. The 
prize will be an autographed pho­
tograph of Lee Nutter or Frank 
Sclmeller, and the lucky miss will 
lie permitted her own choice in the 
matter. Decorations of cigarette 
weeds will again be used, and new
candles will be placed in milk 
bottles as the latter are emptied.
The final event of the sports 
season will be a post-season foot­
ball game between members of the 
Faculty. This hectic performance 
will be staged on the Cut next Sun-* 
day afternoon with Dr. Marks in 
immediate attendance. Winnie 
Winchester will lead her college 
cheering section and will wear 
crimson shorts and a green jersey 
for the occasion. The line-up 'is as

TOBACCOS
In costly tobaccos you will find 
mildness, good taste, throat-ease.
Smoke Camels critically, and 
give your taste a chance to appre­
ciate the greater pleasure and sat­
isfaction offered by the more ex­
pensive tobaccos. Other cigarettes, 
We believe, will taste flat and in­
sipid to you forever after.
which he stopped a 9 lb. cannon ball shot from a 
fully charged cannon. The audience gasped when 
the gun flashed and the human Gibraltar stepped 
forward out of the smoke uninjured, with the 9 lb. 
shot in his hands.
EXPLANATION:
The trick lay in the way an assistant prepared the 
cannon for the performance. He used the regulation 
amount of powder and wadding, but placed the 
greater part of the charge of powder ahead of the 
6hot. The cannon ball was propelled only by the 
small charge behind it which was just sufficient to 
lob the 9 lb. ball over to the strong man.
A performance sometimes staged 
in cigarette advertising is the illu­
sion that cigarettes are made easy 
on the throat by some special 
process of manufacture.
EXPLANATION: All cigarettes are 
made in almost exactly the same 
way. Manufacturing methods are
standard and used by all. A ciga­
rette is only as good as the tobaccos 
it contains.
gjjgy* It is a fact, well known by 
leaf tobacco experts, that 
Camels are made from finer, 
MORE EXPENSIVE tobaccos 
. than any other popular brand.

8THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1933
Above is the swanky Carnegie Tech Club, at 431 Water Street, next
to the Helping Hand Society, which will open its doors Thursday
midnight with a gala celebration. The interior is patterned after that
of the Yaie-Harvard-Princeton Club of Pittsburgh. Many of those ex­
pected to storm the. doors opening night were already in line early 
yesterday.
iSchoen was indignant when In­
formed of the action. He said, 
“I will fight them In the courts. 
The book Is of such a nature that 
I would give it to my own child 
to read. I will continue to give 
copies of the book to my friends 
regardless of the circumstances/’ 
‘‘Oh, me," he sighed.
Schoen's woes as a writer have 
been many. After achieving cam­
pus-wide fame as a critic of things 
theologian, his embarrassment was 
considerable when his “Life of Dr. 
S. Homer Zilch* reached twen­
ty editions. His efforts to get this 
out of circulation have to date 
been futile.

be daunted, has entitled this prize winning photo­
graph, "As We View the Depression.” The Tartan 
realizing Mr. Slagg's great contribution to art, en­
tered this photo In the Beaux Arts contest. Through 
skillful manipulation the picture was awarded first 
prize. You too may see what the judges saw by 
merely turning the photo upsidedown. Hats off to 
Mr. J. G. Slagg, the Tartan’s blind photographer.

Mr. Adolph Bareschlinger, who is pictured above, has been hired 
to serve as head cheerleader next year at Carnegne. Mr. Bare­
schlinger is an experienced and well-known rawrawer. He reluctantly 
consented to give our snooping photographer an interview.
He said: “I have been unemployed for a long time. It is indeed a
pleasure to get back to work. I am sure that I will meet many of my 
old friends, who patronized my establishment which closed recently in 
this city.-
Once again the Tartan makes a scoop. James 
Montgomery Slagg, the photographer with a nose for 
views, snapped this picture of a contented bossy 
cow crossing Fifth avenue at the intersection of 
Smithfield street. The reason the cow Is not seen 
is that bossy was having her crankcase drained at 
Reick’s three blocks away. But Mr. Slagg, not to
Dr. Max Sclioen, well-known 
psychologist has written a book 
entitled “The Sex Life of a Lotus
Flower.” The book has been or­
dered out of circulation by the 
National Book Censors.
