It Is understood that it is the
the proper engineering Held. A pam­phlet entitled “Engineering, a Career, a Culture’’ has been is­sued by the Educational Research Committee of the Engineering Foundation. The pamphlet serves as a counsel to the prospective en­gineering 6tudent, his parents,- and his teachers.Five-Year Plan InauguratedUsing the engineering curriculum at Carnegie as an eiampie, Di Jones continued by stating, “It is safe to say that engineering leges require at least 20 per more work from their students than is demanded by liberal a schools.” He also showed that some schools the five-year plata has ited to alleviate this strain and to give the. engineering student more opportunity to 6tudy the so-called cultural subjects.In conclusion Dr. Jones said, "The' ultimate goal of engineering colleges is to produce men of superior qualifications, especially initiative, creative instinct, of vision, and capacity forwork; , men who possess physicali to Ienergetically, tenacity of purpos to compel them to stick to the en resourcefulness lo direct them oi of the .beaten path Into unexplored regions, personality to enable th to live amicably in their envii ment and knowledge in their par­ticular fields to render them capa­ble of creative work.”______

By Rosemarie Pierce “Shakespeare Is so much alive that he still draw's large audiences, and the significance of this mod­ern theater is that there is a peren nial appetite on the part of the au­dience for plays which have imagin­ation, and which deal frankly with full emotional appeal” said Profes­sor B.

Join In, Plebe!
.With the disregard of freshman regulations 
. becoming noticeably more widespread, the 
• time for a clarification of the question seems 
to have arrived. It Is not filling, however, 
that the desirability or wisdom of these regu­
lations be debated here. The law has been 
written; the Jaw eliould be obeyed.
' It la easy, of course, to make a sweeping 
statement . It is less easy Ia bì specific, to In- 
tlmately appreciate the root causes of tbe dis­
respect for Carnegie tradition that Is being 
shown by so many plebes.
The only proper solution to this problem 
demands some understanding of the freshman 
himself and his attitude toward Carnegie. Per­
haps at flret lt is well to withhold justly ad­
verse criticism, and Bay only that the plebe 
who disregards regulations knows not what
• ' he does. -For surely he 19 more to be pitied
- than punished.
Primarily, the problem of the recalcitrant 
plebe is not one of enforcement, but rather a
• • question of adjustment. Consider the freshman
.who enters Carnegie. Visions of his college ca­
reer stretch before him, brightly embroidered• 
.' with vaulting, ambitious plans for academic and
- extra-curricular pre-eminence. Then, sudden­
ly, he Is shaken from bis dreams and called 
upon to make an abrupt transition from tbe 
heights of prep school achievements to' the 
depths of collegiate nothingness. Further, he 
Is put largely upon his own responsibility 
perhaps for the first time In his life.
The metal of the man is scraped bare by 
such a test. A large number will adjust them­
selves to the new conditions normally and hap­
pily: others will fall. The newcomer to Car- 
- negie who cannot stand the gall will shirk 
and be ashamed IS- serve his campus appren­
ticeship honestly and with erect head; the 
... ‘¡‘clever” fellow who thinks he is- "putting one 
over' will do the same. Neither type has 
' made an adequate adjustment to hia new 
--• vironnrent; both risk earning the contempt of 
'those fellow students who have* traveled the 
same Toad in a manner fully worthy of can­
didates for membership In the clan.
’ Every freshman, for example, who pases an 
Upperclassman on tbe campus without speak- 
•ing to him ought to be thoroughly ashamed of' 
¦•Jtl.Imself.. Many of them are, for their sense of 
guilty inadequacy is betrayed by their down- 
cast or carefully averted gaze. How much 
easier, how much pleasanter to speak!
;:; V-So join in, plebe. You have pledged your- 
aelf to a great school; you should be proud 
;to be seen wearing the Carnegie plaid and 
conforming to your school’s traditional regula­
tions. Especially should you be proud when 
:you realize that- these regulations are in the 
. main only a guide, helping you toward the 
. common courtesies demanded of a gentleman 
and the properly respectful attitude expected 
of one who as yet has his own worth to prove 
In'the college community.
An Urgent Need: 
Education in Government
. The demand for people with training foi 
government Is becoming more apparent dally. 
The “brain trust’' as we once conceived It no 
longer exisle. There Is no definite group in 
Washington to whom President Roosevelt 
turns to for advice on all problems. A clearer 
conception of the Brain Trust would be to 
consider the term as the policy of the Chief 
Executive to collect tbe opinions of anyone 
and everyone, and In particular, those of dis­
interested parties who are well informed as to 
the technical aspects of a particular problem, 
before be decides on a definite altitude.
Now, more than ever before, tbe government 
is making 11 common practice to seek advice 
from people who are most qualified to give it, 
people who are disinterested in the sense that 
there is no profiteering motif concerned that 
might' bias their advice.
Now, more than ever before, tbe government 
s turning for guidance Ia tallìbì graduate's 
who must some day assume the responslblll- 
les of leadership. And the college man of to­
day must realize that need and be prepared to 
supply it.
The day is passing when the butcher, the 
baker, or the candlestick maker could step up 
important positions because they bad 
played their politics wisely. Government has 
been considered a good “racket*’ for too long 
time. Now it must be considered as a good 
career. It's been a much too haphazard group 
that have Laken over the business of govern- 
:—a group made up mainly of people who 
had first to establish themselves in a business 
profession and who turned to politics as a 
sideline, largely for profiteering purposes. 
Such a situation quite naturally gave rise to 
of crooked politics that has existed 
and that still does to a large extent today.
There Is only one way to combat that evil 
and that duty falls 6quarc1y upon .the educa­
tional Institutions a- this country. Every per- 
'ho goes to college, and to Include those 
don't, every person who goes to High 
I, should, by the time he completes his 
education, have a good understanding of the 
trklngs and its current day 
affairs. It 16 a step In which the American 
College must lead the way. Courses In prac­
tical politics, political science, and current 
¡vents should be available In every Institution 
Y higher education in the country, at least as
‘equlred, If possible. The

Initiative in conducting what will, In eRcct, 
i concentrated drive to produce leaders for 
country. And this same drive will have a 
double purpose and benefit for not only will It 
produce people more capable of governing but 
will also turn a great mass of citizens Into 
Intelligent voters.
Today’s governing class Is made up of those 
of the “war” generation which was so greatly 
disabled and which had so many of its great­
est and most potentially ‘eminent spirits wiped 
during the war. Our generation is the 
post-war generation. We have not been dis­
abled like the last. We Aave been bit by the 
depression only to be strengthened immeasur­

full must be educated, trained! And we must 
be ready to present our full strength when the 
responsibility for assuming leadership falls 
upon us.
The need for education in government Is an 
urgent one—an essential one for the future 
welfare of the country. We look to every col* 
lege and university in the nation to supply 
that need.

THE YOUTH MOVEMENT AT MARGARET MORRISON 
At last the Youth of America Is rousing 
itself to assume an active and organized 
Interest In tbe serious problems of life! 
We are witnessing “a change from the tra­ditional apathy of American college stu­dents in political matters!” With such enthusiastic sentences newspaper and magazine writers have recently been pro­claiming the development of a new liberal youth movement Statements of this sort must be based on fact, on some real man­ifestation of this awakening; and among college students we have examples in the recent convention of editors of leading col­lege newspapers, in the national student conferences interested In political and economic questions, in the American dele­gations .to international youth congresses in France this summer. Reports oi these and other gatherings seem to offer tangi­ble proof of the growing interest of under­graduates In matters important outside of the campus. But here at Carnegie and more particularly HI Margaret Morrison, with which I am best acquainted, the re­verberations of any such movement have been faint and almost completely ignored.One wonders whether o movement of this sort could possibly find many adhe­rents among the girls at Margaret Morri­son. Certainly it is useless to conceive of any sort of composite attilude of so varied a group toward a non-exJslent organiza­tion; one can only characterize individ­uals whose probable reactions are per­haps typical of those of particular groups. To participate in any movement of this sort, one must tfave devoted some serious thought to the-* problems under considera­tion. whether they are social, political, or economic. Even in Margaret MorTison there are girls who can think seriously on occasions. There aTe also a few, the so- called typical “coeds.” whose thoughts are occupied principally with “dates” and clothes, wbo go to college because their parents have the money to send them, be­cause ottendlng college is a rather fash­ionable and fairly pleasant way of spend­ing fouT years in association with, other young people. Any serious ideas, invol­untarily absorbed, which endure after ex- aminatlons, ere put aside In a sealed com­partment of the memory to be brought forth for; display when an opportunity pre­sents itself. Here we can And no real sup­port lor a youth movement; but this, the traditionally frivolous, butterfly sort of student, is not nearly so predominant'a type as It was said to be several years ago. It is vanishing with the rest of the Jazz Age.
What of the others, the majority, those who come Ia school expecting to prepare for HCe? Surely among these there must be some who are earnest, thoughtful, In­terested, wbo have definite ideas which they are willing to support and defend. There is first of all the “grind.” whose principal interest Js in securing the. best possible grades, which will In turn secure tor her the beat possible job. Her' llCe is ruled by duty, that is to say, by conven­tion. She will he eminently satisfiedjwllh life when she is able to provide for her parents, marry comfortably, and raifee a number of -normal children. She would, like to have a little wore money, bitt on . the whole she is content with thtngp os they are; she can see no great possibility .[for change about;her, nor anything for . which to fight or against which to tebel. She will eventually join a missionary so-. ciety to aid in remedying .the ghastly! con­ditions ot the heathen Chinese. \
Another girl, Intelligent and sensitive, has a definite career which she ig deter­mined to pursue. She Is interested in-art, in music, in literature, and" in people as part of her experience in life, but she does*, not lose sight of her chief desire. She will not allow herself to be deflected from pursuing her goal by any aophomoric or­ganization that is attempting to dabble In politics. She may not succeed in gaining her end. hut she will succeed in living a full, a valiant, an honest life.
The student who has illusions of genius, who leans toward the artistic—the Bohe­mian, who speaks confidently ot her bril­liant future as an “artiste” is not the; per­son to help initiate anything more serious than a fad. She may add her support to an organization interested in government and politics if it will aid her In striking some distinctive pose, otherwise she-will assume toward any such organization and its members an attitude of bored sophisti­cation. Not being essentially sincere,- she can just as readily become an ardent de- ‘votee as a scornful opponent of any serious
There are several girls who have no veTy definite plans for the future, who hare, as it were, not yet found themselves. Herel &ne would think, is promising-mate­rial—Intelligent young people who are not as yet dominated by any one plan or. am­bition,' and who can therefore be led to take an active interest In furthering a youth movement. But one, although she is Interested and aware of conditions about her, is overfond of daydreams, of half-completed thoughts, of undeveloped ideas. She is too timid, too unsure of her­self to venture doing anything openly that would stamp her as queer or different from the average, she may have the most radi­cally rebellious ideas, but she will try to conform to the conventional in her ac­tions. She lacks' energy, initiatv«*

THE GERMAN BOOMERANGThe Swastika, as in all. phases . ’ Isì social.economic and political life of Germany, has reached down with an iron hand and regimented education.

Swede handled the job with cool calculation quite filling with the demands of the position, and the team responded with substantial scoriae. Carlson also did some efficient blatkhobæ An- bination which was new was the use of Lehman at fullback. Lehman did well but had little chance to carry the ball. Chyczewskl and co-captain Croft did some excellent defensive work, being able to break through the Miami line with telling results. Co-captain Libbus Lewis, although not as spectacular as usual, was able to hold his end position so well that the Miami rushes were unable to make an inch around that side. On the whole the team’s blocking ability did not show up to. the usual par, at least as much as was expected.

Campus Asks for 
Intramural Boxing
we are to believe reports cur- 
arouud campus during the

years there has beeu considerable 
talk concerning the formation of

uothiug definite has ever been done 
about it. In the near future, how-

Carnegie Is in need of some sort of training for her varsity boxing d this looks like the answer. Considering that quite a few of last year's plebe team show- great deal of talent In the it seems probable that more practice would Increase the ability well as the size of the Plaid squad. Boxing, to not a.few of the entering freshmen, is an entirely new sport. Men can enter the in­tramural ring with little experl- (, and learn the fine points of the eport in competition of their

One of ibe most popular tradi­tions on the night campus is tbe presentation or the Klgbt Student Council Insignia Award at tbe end of ea£h school year. Tbls Is purely an honorary award for mer­itorious activities work on tbe campns. It Is a mucb fought award, and one for which all stu­dents should strive.In order Ia guarantee that each student earns the award only upon completion of a mifllcleot amount of work, the Xigbt Student Council has set up a point system whereby the student can earn his award in several different ways. One of the most iavored ways to gain the In- sJgTjfa'is by aidtatJcg at ibe prepa­rations for the various Night Stu­dent Council Dances. This work may he In the forruf of selling tick­ets, decorating tbe ball or general v/ork during tbe dance. However, it Is essential that tbe student who expects to earn the award assist at the aßalrs of his own college as well as aiding the Night Student Council.
