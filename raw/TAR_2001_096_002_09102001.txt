Silicon Valley 
campus faces 
severe budget 
reductions
by Cam Crews
Staffwriter
Plans for building a west coast 
branch of Carnegie Mellon 
University in Silicon Valley, 
California were greatly scaled 
back over the summer. 
Construction of the new campus 
has been deferred and the pro­
gram’s launch has been delayed a 
semester.
The $125 million plan calling 
for the construction of 10 to 20 
buildings has been reduced to a 
$20 million plan and the renova­
tion of three existing buildings at 
NASA’s Ames Research Center. 
The adjustment is due to the 
slowing economy, according to 
Duane Adams, vice provost for 
research.
Though the University’s 
Centennial Fundraising
Campaign exceeded its goals, the 
money raised will serve the 
immediate needs of the 
Pittsburgh campus. Extensive 
startup costs for the west coast 
campus depend upon additional 
corporate, government, and 
alumni contributions. “Now is not 
a good time to ask for donations,” 
said Adams. “We’re going to have 
to wait a while for the economy to 
pick up before we can really go in 
and expect to get major participa­
tion from companies and individ­
uals.”
“We were hoping to raise hun­
dreds of millions of dollars 
instantly but that hasn’t hap­
pened, frankly,” said Jim Morris, 
Dean of the School of Computer 
Science, in a July Post-Gazette

RACISM, COVERUPS ALLEGED

The manuscript reads like it was 
designed for a Hollywood movie 
producer. Tales of a police force 
divided based on skin color, mum­
blings of an illegal relationship 
between an employee and her 
supervisor, and accounts of con­
spiracy by the powers that be to 
cover it all up. Despite its surreal 
qualities, the manuscript is not 
Hollywood, but rather courtroom 
drama. The document is a brief

Police Department is rife with

from disclosing the impropriety.
The suit was filed in May by 
Police Sergeant Annie Budzik, for­

Gail LaPaglia, the widow of former

Cohon proposes 
new commercial 
development on 
Panther Hollow
by Aseem Gupta
Co-E ditor- in-Ch ie f
On Wednesday, President 
Jared Cohon outlined the 
University’s proposal for a new 
commercial-oriented building 
on the CMU campus. The
100,000 square foot facility on 
the Panther Hollow ditch, if 
built, would be equivalent in 
size to the Margaret Morrison 
building and would temporarily 
house several high-tech-related 
companies. The building would 
compliment a larger, non- 
University commercial site on 
the opposite side of the Panther 
Hollow ditch area.
“It’s quite impressive how 
many companies contacted us 
out of the blue,” said Cohon. He 
said that Intel is interested in 
the facility and that companies 
with established offices in 
Pittsburgh like Sony and Oki, 
both Japanese electronic firms, 
might be interested as well. 
Throughout his presentation to 
student leaders, Cohon stressed 
that the University has not 
finalized the project and is sim­
ply trying to gather feedback.
The proposed building would 
be partially funded by the state 
and would be built on the

Intel Corporation, the $174.2 bil­
lion semiconductor chip maker and 
the single largest corporate con­
tributor to Carnegie Mellon, has 
reached an agreement with the 
University to establish a new 
research lab adjacent to campus.
Wanting to keep the plans from 
the broader University community 
a secret until they were finalized, 
neither the University nor Intel 
acknowledged the lab until a 
reporter for London’s Financial 
Times broke the story in the Post- 
Gazette last week. Plans for an Intel 
lab in the basement of the 
University Center fizzled earlier 
this year after an outcry of opposi­
tion from the student body. The 
new lab will now be located off- 
campus above the UniMart on 
Craig Street.

Intel attempted to reassure 
investors last week with an 
announcement that it was on track to 
meet quarterly forecasts. Despite a 
recent increase in revenue, the com­
pany said its three-month revenue 
should be “slightly below the mid­
point,” falling short of the target 
range of $6.8 to $6.2 billion accord­
ing to Thomson Financial/ First Call.

director of the lab, Satyanarayaan 
will take a two year sabbatical to 
enter into Intel’s employment. The 
lab will focus on issues of information 
storage and retrieval. Intel will 
employ a full-time staff at the facility 
as well as faculty, researchers, and 
graduate students from CMU and 
other universities.
“The lab will facilitate a closer 
exchange of ideas and informa­
tion,” said Kevin Teixeira, an Intel 
spokesperson. “The big challenge 
in research is the exchange and 
transfer of ideas between academia 
and corporations.”
Teixeira said that research comes 
down to the people who do it, and 
unlike other corporations, Intel has 
a decentralized internal research 
model designed to facilitate the 
exchange of ideas. The new lab, he 
said, is a way to further facilitate 
this exchange. “[Intel is] out at uni­

Carnegie Mellon’s US News ranking remains unchanged at twenty-three
by Sara Stille
Co-Editor-in-Chief
US News and World Report 
released their annual college 
rankings list last week with 
Carnegie Mellon tied with 
Georgetown University for 23rd 
in undergraduate programs, 
maintaining the University’s 
ranking from the previous year. 
CMU also retained its top 10 rat­
ing in the business and engineer­
ing fields.
Princeton University was 
ranked number one in this year’s 
list, followed by Harvard 
University and Yale University, 
who tied for second. California 
Institute of Technology took 
third, while Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, Stanford 
University, and the University of 
Pennsylvania all tied for fourth.
Looking at more specific areas, 
CMU was tied with Cornell
University, Purdue University, 
and the University of Michigan at 
Ann Arbor for a seventh place 
ranking for its undergraduate 
engineering program. This is up 
two places from CMU’s ninth 
place rating in 1999. The under­
graduate business program at 
CMU decreased two places from 
its 1999 fifth place rating to be 
tied with the University of 
Virginia at seventh.
CMU’s undergraduate business 
school tied with MIT for first for 
its e-commerce specialty program 
and was second for management 
information systems, produc­
tion/operations management, 
and quantitative analysis meth­
ods. The engineering program 
ranked ahead of Stanford 
University and the University of 
Illinois at Urbana with third in 
the computer specialty area.
US News suggests that readers 
should not track colleges’ annual 
moves in the rankings because of
changes in their ranking formula 
and also changes in the classifica­
tion system they use. Late in
2000, the Carnegie Foundation 
for the Advancement of Teaching 
updated its Carnegie 
Classification of Institutions of 
Higher Education which is the 
ranking system used by US News, 
as well as governments and foun­
dations making funding decisions 
and many researchers who study 
trends in higher education.
This year US News also changed 
its naming scheme. Rankings are 
now assigned according to the 
following categories: “national 
universities - doctoral,” “liberal 
arts colleges - bachelor’s,” “uni­
versities - master’s,” and “com­
prehensive colleges - bachelor’s.” 
There are over 1400 schools 
included in the rankings.
Schools are ranked in three 
steps. First, schools are catego­
rized by mission and, in some I

Recent study reverses previous reports on 
connection between depression, Net usage
by Sinduja Srinivasan
Junior Staffwriter
With the increase of Internet 
usage has come a growth in 
Internet user-related research. 
Carnegie Mellon’s Robert Kraut, a 
professor of human-computer 
interaction, and Sara Kiesler, a psy­
chology professor, were two of the 
earliest researchers to study the 
social effects of daily Internet use. 
Recently, the team released a new 
study about Internet usage, levels 
of depression, and stress that 
seems to contradict previous 
research findings.
Three years ago, Kraut 
announced the results from a study 
that began in 1995. His conclusions 
showed that those who used the 
Internet for lengthy periods of time 
reported increased feelings of 
depression and loneliness and 
decreased interactions with family 
and friends.
“Many users may be substituting
weak online friendships for their 
stronger, real-life relationships,” 
said Kiesler in 1998. “You don’t 
have to deal with unpleasantness, 
because if you don’t like some­
body’s behavior, you can just log 
off.”
The 1998 results caused a stir in 
both scientific and public arenas. 
Some charged that the study, 
though it followed 169 people from 
73 families, all of which differed in 
terms of age, ethnicity and income 
within the Pittsburgh area, was too 
small and concentrated for the 
results to be extended into nation­
wide generalizations. However, 
Kraut’s 1998 Internet usage study 
is credited as being the first to con­
sider the same subjects repeatedly, 
thus forming the basis for a method 
that allows scientists to draw more 
definite and insightful conclusions.
Now, three years after the first 
set of results was released, Kraut’s 
team has produced another related 
study. After observing the original 
group of subjects again and study­
ing a new group composed of 466l 
individuals, the team is now lean-| 
ing toward conclusions that seeml 
to contradict the first set. Internetl 
usage does not increase symptoms| 
of depression and loneliness, clair 
Kraut’s team. Rather, the Internet 
may encourage and increase social 
interactions. The new study stil( 
shows, however, that there exists 
small percentage (about 13 per-j 
cent) of users who reportec 
decreased interactions with friendij 
and family members when the time 
they spent on the Interne] 
increased.
Kraut and Kiesler are leaning, ad 
are other researchers studying thd 
issue, towards the “rich get richer! 
theory of Internet usage. The theol 
ry speculates that those who ar{

World racism conference ends in tumult
DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — 
The World Conference Against 
Racism ended Saturday as tumul­
tuously as it began, with a declara­
tion and program of action that was 
immediately cited as groundbreak­
ing and momentous, hurtful and 
disastrous, and everything in 
between.
The eight-day U.N. meeting went 
into a ninth day when compromises 
on the two dominant issues — the 
Middle East conflict and the legacy 
of slavery — failed to materialize.
Even when deals on both issues 
were struck Saturday morning, last- 
minute attempts to add several thin­
ly veiled references to Israel dead­
locked the conference and sent 
diplomats scurrying. Only the 
iitiminent departure of the inter­
preters and some rough use of par­
liamentary procedure brought 
debate to an end and kept out the 
additional paragraphs.
When the final meeting was 
called, the president of the confer­
ence, South African Foreign 
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, 
declared the documents adopted 
before any of the delegates had a 
chance to speak, sparking more 
anger, but no one walked out. 
Organizers called the conference a 
success.
“We have, come a very long way. 
The language will resonate 
throughout the world,” said U.N. 
High Commissioner for Human 
Rights Mary Robinson, who orga­
nized the meeting.
At stake were two pledges: a dec­
laration promising to fight racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance; and a pro­
gram of action spelling out how 
they should be fought. The docu­
ments are not legally binding, but 
countries will be monitored to see if 
they keep their promises.
The United States and Israel with­
drew their delegations halfway 
through the conference, protesting 
efforts to single out Israel for criti­
cism.
While original references con­
demning the “racist practices” of 
Israel and Zionism — the move­
ment to establish and maintain a 
Jewish state — were removed from 
the final declaration, a reference to 
“the plight of the Palestinians” 
remained.
In Washington, a State 
Department spokeswoman said US 
officials could not comment on the 
final document because they had 
not seen it, but indicated there were 
no second thoughts about the deci­
sion to withdraw.
“We appreciate the effort of other 
parties in the conference who 
thought to remove the offensive lan­
guage,” said spokeswoman Susan 
Pittman. “We’re confident that our
withdrawal was the correct mea­
sure and hope the decision had 
some effect on a better but still 
flawed result.”
Secretary of State Colin Powell, 
who was in San Francisco, said that 
it is “unfortunate that it took this 
process to get results.”
Israel’s Foreign Ministry issued a 
statement saying that the country 
“expresses satisfaction” but that the 
final conference document was “not 
the best.”
“The world rejected the attempts 
of the radical Arab nations to take 
over the conference and damage its 
intentions by turning it into a stage 
for attacking Israel,” it said.
Later, ministry spokeswoman 
Yaffa Ben Ari declined to comment 
on whether Israel would have 
remained had the compromise been 
worked out earlier. But she suggest­
ed the US and Israeli withdrawals 
led to the changes.
“There’s no doubt that the with­
drawal of Israel and the United 
States from the conference brought 
the turning point in relation to this 
issue,” Ben Ari said.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan conceded, “It is regrettable 
that the useful work of the confer­
ence was overshadowed on one or 
two highly emotional issues, espe­
cially in the Middle East. Many hurt­
ful things were said... which tended 
to inflame the atmosphere rather 
than to encourage rational and con­
structive discussion.”
But, he added in a statement from 
his office in New York, “to have left 
Durban without agreement would 
have given comfort to the worst ele­
ments in every society.” 
Immediately after the document’s 
adoption, Canada and Australia dis­
associated themselves from the 
paragraphs on the Middle East.
“We are not satisfied with this 
conference. Too much time has 
been spent on an issue which does 
not belong here,” the head of the 
Canadian delegation, Paul 
Heinbecker, told the conference. 
“We want to condemn at this con­
ference the attempts to delegitimize 
the state of Israel.”
Speaking in Italy, Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres said he was 
pleased with the European Union 
and other countries for keeping any 
direct reference to Israel out of the 
final document.
“What happened in Durban was a 
scandal,” Peres said in an interview 
with Italian news agencies. “What 
occurred is that a majority of non- 
democratic countries tried to give 
democracy lessons to democratic 
countries ... I think that if we hadn’t 
left, nothing would have happened” 
to improve the text.
Muslim nations led by Iran, Iraq 
and the 56-member Organization of
Islamic Conference, were also 
unhappy with the final text, saying 
not enough attention was paid to 
Israel and the Palestinians.
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk 
al-Sharaa rejected a paragraph rec­
ognizing the Holocaust, saying that 
Europeans were responsible for the 
genocide and “are trying to spread 
their guilt around the world.”
Robinson and African nations 
immediately praised the language 
referring to the legacy of slavery, cit­
ing it as the most historic outcome 
of the conference. But again, many 
nations thought it did not go far 
enough.
“Africa had a rendezvous with 
history,” said Amina Mohamed, the 
Kenyan mediator in the talks. “We 
have an agreement on a document 
that is far from satisfactory, is terri­
bly imperfect, but that provides a 
basis to build on, and I think, for the 
first time, the dignity of the black 
man has been recognized.”
Under the slavery deal, the con­
ference acknowledged slavery and 
the slave trade as a crime against 
humanity and “should always have 
been so.” It also expressed an apolo­
gy in the form of acknowledgment 
for the wrongs of slavery and colo­
nialism and offered a package of 
economic assistance to Africa.
It remained unclear what the new 
language would mean for European 
fears of potential lawsuits seeking 
reparations, though several 
European delegates said on condi­
tion of anonymity their fears had 
been addressed.
Despite efforts to expand the 
grounds of discrimination that 
should be illegal to include religion, 
language, and sexual orientation, 
the conference recommended they 
be' limited to the current definition 
of race, skin color, descent, and 
national or ethnic background.
The racism conference was the 
first time human and civil rights 
groups were allowed to participate 
in a U.N. conference, and many 
went away unhappy. Indigenous 
groups from the Americas joined 
Jewish groups in condemning the 
conference’s outcome. Palestinian 
groups expressed disappointment 
with it as well.
“We wanted clearer language in 
regard to Israeli practices and poli­
cies,” said Nasser al-Kidwa, the 
Palestinian representative to the 
United Nations who represented 
Arab countries at the conference.
US human rights lawyer Chip 
Pitts linked the hardening of posi­
tions on the Middle East to the acri­
monious atmosphere in Durban.
“Lots of issues were neglected 
because of the politicized nature of 
the final document,” Pitts said. “It 
was the reinforcement of the worst 
tendencies toward polarization.”

Fake letter shakes 
NYC restaurants
NEW YORK (AP) — It was the kind 
of letter that causes indigestion in 
restaurateurs: a customer complain­
ing that an anniversary dinner with 
his wife had left him violently ill. In 
fact, it was the letter that was rotten.
A Columbia University professor, in 
an unsanctioned study on how busi­
nesses handle complaints, sent out 
240 letters making a phony food-poi- 
soning claim to some of the city’s 
poshest restaurants, a university 
spokesman said Saturday.
The letter caused a crisis of confi­
dence in kitchens across the city — 
from Chez Josephine to Le Bernadin 
to the Mesa Grill — until it was 
exposed this week as bogus.
“This was an enormous, very seri­
ous lack of judgment,” said Columbia 
spokesman Virgil Renzulli. “It was 
not malicious, but the professor did 
not anticipate the consequences.”
The brouhaha began when Frank 
Flynn, a professor at the Columbia 
Business School, decided to collect 
data for a research study on the han­
dling of customer complaints.
Using university letterhead, he 
mailed the same letter to 240 restau­
rants in mid-August, describing gas­
tronomic distress following a meal to 
celebrate his wedding anniversary.
“Our special romantic evening 
became reduced to my wife watching 
me curl up in the fetal position on the 
tiled floor of our bathroom between 
rounds of throwing up,” the letter
read. The reason? “Food poisoning,” 
it concluded.
At restaurants that received the let­
ter, chefs and owners were sent 
scrambling. Receipts and reserva­
tions were reviewed as they tried to 
confirm the complaint, while the 
staffs were drilled in proper tech­
niques in food preparation.
“This could be the kiss of death for 
a restaurant,” said Jean-Claude 
Baker, owner of Chez Josephine.
Eventually, one of the restaurants 
determined that the letter did not 
match up with its internal paper­
work. The owner wrote his own letter
— to the dean of the business school, 
Meyer Feldberg.
“The dean found out Monday,” 
Renzulli said. “On Thursday, we mes- 
sengered letters of apology to all 240 
restaurants. We’ve already had one- 
on-one conversations with 60 of the 
businesses.”
Flynn sent out another letter, on 
plain paper, to “sincerely apologize 
for the horrible mistake that I made ”
As for Flynn’s future at the school, 
Renzulli said the case was turned 
over to an academic review board for 
consideration. It was unclear when 
the board might reach a final deter­
mination on the case, he said.
Justice denies 
atheist request
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — 
State Supreme Court Chief Justice 
Roy Moore has denied a request from 
an atheists group to put a statue of 
the organization’s symbol in the
lobby of the state judicial building.
American Atheists Inc. is the latest 
group to try to place a statue in the 
building since Moore had a monu­
ment to the Ten Commandments 
moved into the building in August.
The group’s state director Larry 
Darby had sent a letter to Moore 
requesting permission to place the 
statue in the building. Moore replied 
Friday with a letter denying the 
request, saying it was rejected “as not 
being in conformity with the purpose 
or theme of the foundation of 
American Law and government.”
Darby said the sculpture would 
have served as a counterpoint to the 
Ten Commandments monument and 
“to remind visitors that our American 
judicial system and government were 
forged from Enlightenment think­
ing.”
A group of black legislators is seek­
ing to place a monument in the build­
ing honoring the Rev. Martin Luther 
King Jr.’s “I Have A Dream” speech. 
Moore told them last week to submit 
a letter.
He had said through a spokesman 
he did not plan to allow any displays 
in the building other than the Ten 
Commandments monument, which 
also contains quotations from 
Thomas Jefferson, James Madison 
and other founding fathers. Moore 
has said its purpose is to show that 
the Commandments inspired mod­
ern law.
Moore, a Republican, was elected 
chief justice in November after cam­
paigning as “Alabama’s Ten
Commandments judge.”
World News
said.The Israeli army said the attack 
came in retaliation for shooting 
attacks on Israelis, including a 
roadside ambush Thursday that 
killed a soldier and seriously 
wounded another.
Ambulances rushed to the scene 
of the strike, but there were no ini­
tial reports of injuries.
Two helicopters were heard in 
the air moments before three mis­
siles hit the eight-floor building, 
causing severe damage on the 
floor of the Fatah offices, witness­
es said.
Carlos Zaghlool, a Fatah employ­
ee in the building, said a meeting 
of party officials ended just before 
the missiles struck.
“I was still inside when I heard 
some helicopters flying very close 
to the building,” said Zaghlool, 
who managed to get out of the 
smoke-filled offices through the 
bathroom window. “One missile 
entered the room.”
Marwan Barghouti, leader of the 
Tanzim militia that is affiliated 
with Fatah, accused Israel of tar­
geting a top Fatah official, 
Muhammed Mansour, who had left 
the building moments before the 
attack. The army would not com­
ment on the accusation.
Israel has repeatedly accused the 
Fatah party of involvement in 
attacks and many of its gunmen 
are wanted by Israel.
AIDS program to 
begin in Nigeria
ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigeria 
began what it called Africa’s most 
ambitious AIDS treatment program 
Friday — although health officials 
admitted they had yet to receive 
any of the cheap generic drugs 
needed for the plan.
The government’s program had 
originally been scheduled to kick 
off September 1. Officials, however, 
have not finished developing a sys­
tem to administer and control the 
drugs, Health Minister Alphonsus 
Nwosu told journalists.
Authorities are working to weed 
out fraudulent HIV claims from 
Nigeria’s notorious crime rings. 
Nwosu said the criminals were 
already trying to get on the list of
15,000 patients in order to obtain 
and resell the sought-after drugs on 
the black market.
Further complicating matters, 
non-government advocacy groups 
representing people with HIV are 
aggressively lobbying Nigeria’s gov­
ernment to distribute the drugs 
through their organizations.
As of now, Nigeria — the most 
populous nation in Africa, with 120 
million people — has virtually no 
treatment for AIDS patients.
Medical care is too expensive for 
most patients here, where 2.6 mil­
lion people are known to have the
HIV virus that causes AIDS.
The $4 million program would 
provide cheap drugs to just a tiny 
fraction of those infected — 10,000 
adults and 5,000 children.
Indian pharmaceutical company 
Ranbaxy Laboratories is among the 
companies being considered to pro­
vide anti-AIDS drugs to the pro­
gram. Cipla, another Indian firm, 
already has a contract to sell a 
three-drug AIDS cocktail for $350 a 
year per patient. Patients will pay 
less than a third of that — about 
$120 — while the government will 
pick up the rest, Nwosu said.
He credited Nigerian President 
Olusegun Obasanjo with spear­
heading the effort. Obasanjo said 
he was committed to making sure 
the original 15,000 people chosen 
would “be provided with treatment 
as long as he is president.”
The plan is the largest of its kind 
in Africa, according to Stephen 
Lewis, special envoy of Secretary- 
General Kofi Annan for HIV/AIDS 
in Africa.

to higher education. It seems that 
almost every commerce-related 
periodical from Business Week to 
the Wall Street Journal has creat­
ed some formula designed to rate 
the quality of graduate business 
schools. Prospective students 
often look toward US News and 
World Report’s rankings of the 
nation’s top universities and col­
leges when making a decision, 
and graduate students are not
quite different.
“Your customers really can’t 
judge a service prior to it being 
delivered, so you try to use any 
kind of statistic or number to 
build your case, to demonstrate 
excellence,” said Katz School 
Dean Frederick Winter in a 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article. 
“The ones who do well tout it,” he 
added. “I think anybody in the 
business knows they aren’t terri­
bly valid.”
However, that did not prevent 
outgoing GSIA Dean Douglas 
Dunn from touting the pre-emi- 
nence of his school when the Wall 
Street Journal and Harris 
Interactive released a study that 
called GSIA the second-best b- 
school in the world behind 
Dartmouth College’s Tuck School 
of Business. Business Week, US
News and World Report, and the 
Gourman Report have not ranked 
GSIA any higher than 13th since 
1992.
Since a 1992 Business Week 
review of graduate business pro­
grams downgraded GSIA from 
ninth to 17th due to what the 
magazine called “student dissat­
isfaction” with unresponsive 
administrators, GSIA has consis­
tently placed in the mid-teens. 
Prior to the 1988 Business Week 
survey, one that found GSIA 
placed 13th, grading of B-schools 
consisted primarily of opinions 
expressed by business school 
deans. The business magazine 
began to ask students to grade 
their schools on a variety of 
issues. Business Week also inter­
viewed recruiters in an effort to

Reductions in initial 
cost estimates have not 
changed the long-term 
goals of the program, 
according to Adams. 
“We’ve got a vision three 
years down the road of a 
[west coast] presence 
that would have multi­
ple buildings ... we’ve 
got to get started and 
grow as the opportuni­
ties present them­
selves.”
This January, the west 
coast campus will 
launch a pilot program 
for the master of science 
in information technolo­
gy with 20 part-time 
students, according to 
Adams. The pilot pro­
gram targets profession­
als in the Silicon Valley 
area seeking to improve
their credentials. “We 
think [the students] will 
be either part-time stu­
dents working for 
Silicon Valley compa­
nies or people who don’t 
have a job and are look­
ing to upgrade their 
skills,” Morris told the 
Post-Gazette.
Raj Reddy, Simon 
University professor of 
robotics and computer 
science and head of the 
future California cam­
pus, declined to com­
ment on the specifics of 
the west coast program 
until a lease is signed. 
Failure to formalize a 
lease within the month 
may push back the 
launch of the pilot pro­
gram until the fall of 
2002.
The environmental 
impact statement to
determine the effect a 
west coast campus will 
have upon Silicon Valley 
is still under develop­
ment by NASA. After the 
statement is prepared, it 
must undergo review in 
public hearings and will 
be fine-tuned to accom­
modate the needs of 
Silicon Valley.
Community approval of 
the plan is required for 
the construction of the 
new campus to begin.
“California school sys­
tems are going to have 
to grow, either expand­
ing existing schools , or 
creating new campus­
es,” said Adams, adding 
that working coopera­
tively with California’s 
academic institutions is 
a goal of the program. 
“We’re not perceiving 
we’re looked at as a
competitor [to
California universities]; 
we’re in many cases a 
collaborator.”
Once the project is 
finalized, the University 
hopes that the west 
coast campus will pro­
vide research and 
internship opportunities 
with corporations, offer 
educational programs, 
maintain contact with 
the 2500 alumni in the 
Bay area, and “serve as a 
conduit for activities in 
Pennsylvania and the 
west coast.”
“The State of 
Pennsylvania wants to 
be able to do business 
with companies in 
California,” said Adams. 
“I’m hopeful [the west 
coast campus] is going 
to be a success in all 
dimensions.”
Corporate complex proposed for CMU
Student Dormitory Council ponders usage of $40,000 budget surplus
by Pearl S. Goldman
Junior Staffwriter
At a meeting on September 5, 
the Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC) addressed new issues and 
goals for the 2001-2002 academic 
year. Topping the meeting’s agen­
da was the question of how to 
spend SDC’s budget surplus total­
ing approximately $40,000. This 
aggregate sum came from 
unspent monies that have accu­
mulated over the past several 
years. While most student organi­
zations receive funding from 
Student Government and must 
return their budget surpluses at 
the end of each fiscal year, SDC is 
funded by students’ semi-annual 
dormitory fees and is permitted 
to keep its budget surpluses. Last 
year, SDC attempted to minimize 
its yearly surplus by increasing 
funding to RAs and to small SDC
programs. SDC successfully spent 
its entire budget for the 2000 fis­
cal year, yet it still possesses the 
$40,000 surplus from previous 
years.
“SDC would like to see these 
monies spent in the best way for 
campus, specifically residents,” 
said Anthony Balducci, a junior in 
chemical engineering and the 
SDC president. “We feel the only 
way to do this is to include input 
from as many people as possible.”
SDC will rely heavily on stu­
dent input when deciding how to 
spend the $40,000 in ways that 
will satisfy the majority of resi­
dent students. In order for stu­
dents’ ideas to be considered, 
they must log onto the SDC Web 
site and submit proposals. An 
SDC committee will evaluate 
each entry as they are submitted 
on a rolling basis via email. 
Students whose ideas pass the 
first review will be asked to give a
five minute presentation to thè 
committee about their proposal. 
By Thursday, October 18, the 
committee will announce the 
final money allocations.
“We are not putting any restric­
tions on how [the money] is 
spent, so we’re open to anything - 
as many ideas as possible,” said 
Theresa Nguyen, a junior biology 
major and SDC secretary and 
treasurer.
Current considerations for sur­
plus spending include the pur­
chase of DVD players, Sony 
Playstations, and foosball and 
pinball machines for dorm 
lounges. Whether machines and 
equipment will be permanently 
placed in specific dorms or rotate 
between dorms on either a month, 
or semester-long basis is yet to be 
decided.

like Hamburg or Baker Hall, it 
will retain certain features of the 
Hornbostel style. Commenting 
that the University Bookstore is 
not a “real” university bookstore, 
Cohon said that he would like to 
see a full-scale bookstore in the 
building. Cohon did not elaborate 
on the larger complimentary 
building to be build on the oppo­
site side of the ditch, except that 
the space would contain perma­
nent offices for high-tech ven­
tures as well as some retail space.
According to Cohon, the two 
commercial buildings would be 
part of a larger effort to redevel­
op the Panther Hollow area and 
the area leading from the ditch 
down to the river front where 
various high-tech ventures are 
located, including the Carnegie 
Mellon Research Institute. Cohon 
said that the eventual linking of 
the two sites could lead to a new 
roadway or even a slow-speed 
magnetic levitation train. 
Overall, the transition of the 
Panther Hollow area fits in with
the University’s Master Plan 
which includes development oi 
new buildings and parking areas 
on campus. The Master Plan calls 
for the conversion of several sur­
face parking areas on campus to 
green areas and for maissivé 
development around the area o{ 
Hamburg Hall.
Reaction from student leader« 
present at Cohon’s announcement 
was mixed — some expressec 
concerns about the presence o 
corporate offices physically locat 
ed on the campus, and other; 
wanted assurances about the 
availability of jobs and intern 
ships with companies partnering 
with the University. Others wen 
pleased with the possibility of th< 
new underground parking area 
and by the new academic spac< 
that the building would eventual 
ly provide for the campus. Cohoi 
assured the group that the loca 
tion of commercial ventures oi 
campus would be “precisely wh 
the companies are there — t 
work with the students.”
CORPORATE SITE, from page Al
Panther Hollow ditch, the area 
adjacent to Hamburg Hall and 
Facilities Management Services. 
According to Cohon, the building 
would be 100,000 square feet and 
contain 300 underground parking 
spaces. With the University’s cur­
rent estimates that garage park­
ing costs $25,000 per space, the 
building’s garage alone will be 
valued at $7.5 million. The park­
ing will not be immediately avail­
able to the campus community as 
it will be used by building occu­
pants. However, when the build­
ing is eventually turned over to 
academic use — within 5 years 
according to the current plan — it 
would result in an over ten per­
cent increase in parking space, 
given the number of spaces avail­
able today on campus.
Architecturally, the building 
would blend into the campus’s 
traditional Hornbostel style. 
While Cohon said it may not be a 
traditional Hornbostel building

RANKING, from page A1 
cases, region. Data is gathered 
based on 16 indicators of acade­
mic excellence and each factor is 
assigned a weight. The seven dif­
ferent categories are “academic 
reputation,” “retention of stu­
dents,” “faculty resources,” “stu­
dent selectivity,” “financial 
resources,” “alumni giving,” and 
“graduation rate performance.” 
Finally, each college in each cat­
egory is compared to its peers 
and ranked accordingly.
In past years, however, there 
has been skepticism from critics 
who claim that the US News’ cur­
rent ranking method neglects to 
account for the more intangible 
qualities of the different universi­
ties, such as student satisfaction. 
Last year in an article by Amy 
Graham and Nicholas Thompson 
in The Washington Monthly called 
“Broken Ranks,” the authors 
denounced the rankings for pay­
ing “scant attention to measures 
of learning or good educational 
practices.”
According to the Columbia Daily
Spectator, in last year’s rankings, 
Columbia suffered a loss in rating 
because of a methodology change 
that adjusted a school’s per-stu- 
dent spending by its undergradu­
ate to graduate student ratio. This 
was a disadvantage to large 
research universities, such as 
Columbia, while being an advan­
tage to smaller universities with 
less graduate students.
In an article accompanying the 
rankings in US News, Robert 
Morse and Samuel Flanigan cau­
tioned readers against weighing 
the ratings and changes up and 
down in ranking with too much 
importance. They claimed that 
part of the reason for these move­
ments in rank is the change in cal­
culation methodology from year 
to year. They also said that the 
largest determinant of a school’s 
rank is its reputation. According 
to Morse and Flanigan, the 
school’s reputation is determined 
by survey results from presidents, 
provosts, and deans of admissions 
of that school’s peer institutions.
US News has admitted that it
fails to account for intangible 
qualities. Still, many students 
look to the rankings for at least a 
starting point in their college 
search.
“I looked at the rankings when I 
began my college search, but I 
really just used them as a starting 
point,” said Anita Shen, a senior 
electrical and computer engineer­
ing major. “I looked more at the 
school’s location, the campus 
itself, and also students and pro­
fessors that I met to make my 
final decision. It seems like the j 
rankings are a pretty good way to 
get a general idea about the 
schools, but I don’t think I’d take 
them too seriously.”
“I was definitely aware of 
CMU’s ranking when I decided to 
come here, but it didn't have | 
much of an influence on my deci­
sion,” said Michael Gibbons, a 
sophomore in the sciences and 
humanities scholars program. 
“The strength of individual col­
leges and the impression I had of 
the student body were a lot more 
important to me.”

SDC to accept student input on spending
SDC, from page A3 
discussion, the dance marathon 
scheduled to be held during 
Homecoming weekend on the 
Cut was also addressed at the 
recent SDC meeting. Projected to 
encourage positive student and 
alumni relations, the 15-hour 
event will include various stu­
dent groups, including residence
halls, sports teams, Greek organi­
zations, and clubs that will com­
pete against one another for the 
title of highest sponsored group.
Another proposition discussed 
at the SDC meeting was the ques­
tion of how to increase student 
representation from dormitories. 
According to SDC members and 
officers, a “representative com-
petition” between dormitories 
would increase dormitory spirit 
on campus. A percentage of stu­
dents from each residence hall 
would be sponsored to represent 
their building competitively. 
Whether Oakland apartments 
would qualify as part of or sepa­
rately from the rest of the resi­
dence halls is undecided.

Intel research lab to open on Craig Street

lenges — establishing 
labs,” said Teixeira.
Currently, it appears 
that the lab will work on 
distributed data storage 
and its applications. Intel 
expects the future of 
computing to lie in dis­
tributed systems where 
tiny computers, each
capable of processing 
data, are placed in many 
locations such as in cars. 
Rather than store infor­
mation in a central repos­
itory, information will be 
in sync across a network 
of small computers, and 
the computers will each 
be able to process infor­
mation and provide
immediate feedback.
Teixeira said that Intel’s 
commitment to the lab 
was long term and noted 
similar lab concepts adja­
cent to other major uni­
versities such as the 
University of California at 
Berkeley and the 
University of Washington.
The location of the new
lab is expected to be tem­
porary, and Intel is a 
prime candidate for office 
space in President 
Cohon’s proposed com­
mercial campus facility. 
Intel has not decided on a 
name for the lab, nor has 
it committed to the pro­
posed campus commer­
cial facility.
Mass appeal factor drastically 
improves GSIA ranking by WSJ
GSIA, from page A3
shed light on the abilities of stu­
dents from b-schools.
In a Post-Gazette interview, 
Dunn said that the Journals 
methodology “got it right.” The 
Wall Street Journal/ Harris
Interactive study focused exclu­
sively on the opinions of over 
1,600 corporate recruiters, indi­
viduals who actively pursue tal­
ent at business schools through 
career fairs and speaking 
engagements. Business schools 
provided Harris with the contact 
information. The research firm 
in turn set up controls to moni­
tor the grading recruiters pro­
vided. 80 percent of a school’s 
ranking was determined by a 
recruiter’s perceptions of the 
school and its students, while 
20% of the school’s finish was 
based upon “mass appeal.” The 
mass appeal component was 
defined by the total number of 
recruiters grading a school.
While the exiting Dean Dunn 
commented that he was both 
“pleased and proud” by the find­
ings of WSJ and Harris, some 
individuals took the results as 
nothing more than an anomaly. 
Alan Charness, a first-year Flex 
student at GSIA and graduate of 
the University’s undergraduate 
mathematics and economics pro­
gram, analyzed the data and 
concluded differently than 
Dunn. He characterized the sur­
vey as “methodologically 
flawed.” “The recruiter survey
portion was so heavily overshad­
owed by the mass appeal portion 
that the survey becomes a con­
test of which university could get 
the most recruiters to fill out the 
most surveys,” said Charness.
“From a marketing standpoint, 
when most people fill out a sur­
vey, values tend to cluster 
between six and nine [when 
based on a ten-point scale].” He 
added that such measurements 
lead to a tight range of values 
with 75% of schools scoring 
between 54 and 58 on the 
recruiter perception portion.
However, the mass appeal val­
ues fell into a much wider range. 
Mass appeal was figured by 
dividing the total number of 
recruiter responses for a particu­
lar university by 109, the highest 
number of recruiters rating any 
one school and multiplying the 
quotient by 20 in order to reflect 
the 20% mass appeal factor. 
Carnegie Mellon finished first in 
mass appeal with 109 responses, 
while schools such as 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, Stanford University, 
and the Wharton School at the 
University of Pennsylvania 
attracted the responses of a sig­
nificantly smaller number of 
recruiters.
Charness contends that the 
removal of the mass appeal fac­
tor places CMU 25th, a middle of 
the pack figure that is more con­
sistent with the school’s ranking 
in US News and World Report and 
Business Week.
“Let’s say a school was not too 
responsive and only hooked up 
the WSJ with 20 recruiters. If 
they ended up with a score of 
55.3, they would be in 50th 
place (with 3.7 points coming 
from the “mass appeal” portion). 
If that same school ended up 
putting in a bit more effort at 
hooking up with WSJ with 
recruiters (who had the same 
impression as the original 20 
recruiters), and were reviewed 
by 109 schools (the maximum), 
that school would end up with a 
score of 71.63, putting the pro­
gram into third place,” hypothe­
sized Charness.
In an online forum, Dr. Joy 
Sever, senior vice president at 
Harris Interactive did concede 
that “ ‘mass appeal’ reflects both 
the reach that the school has 
with recruiters and the strength 
of relationship that the school 
has with its recruiters.” She also 
argued that the “mass appeal” 
factor not only protects smaller 
schools form garnering a higher 
placement because it has partic­
ularly close ties with several 
recruiters, but lacks broader 
appeal.
When Charness removed the 
mass appeal component, he also 
noted one other peculiarity. 
Wharton, Harvard, and Stanford 
all finished at the bottom of the 
top 50. In rival ranking systems, 
all three schools consistently fin­
ish at the very top.
“Just something to think 
about,” commented Charness.
Internet usage may increase stress levels
INTERNET, from page A1 
with increased frequency.
“Extroverts like making new 
friends and so use technology to 
express themselves,” recently 
Kraut told The New York Times. 
“When introverts are using the 
Internet, it seems to hurt their 
social well-being and their social 
connectedness.”
In both the 1998 and recently 
released studies, one result 
remained constant: Increased
Internet usage led to increased 
feelings of stress. The reason for 
this is not yet understood. “We 
can’t pin down why the more peo­
ple use the Internet, the more they 
report a wide range of daily life 
stresses,” said Kraut. One proposed 
theory as to why stress levels rise 
with increased use of the Internet
is that people are trying to cram 
one more activity, computer usage, 
into overburdened schedules and 
thus add stress to their lives.
While the results from the two 
studies seem contradictory, Kraut 
accounts for the discrepancy very 
simply. In 1995, the year that the 
study began, Internet usage was 
quite low, nationally. He explains 
that, “as less than one-fifth of the 
population had access to the 
Internet, the chances of friends or 
family members being online were 
also very low.” This statistic might 
help to explain why participants in 
the earlier study tended to feel 
more isolated upon spending more 
time online. “Now, nearly 60 per­
cent of the population is online 
and if you wanted to talk to some­
one today, it could be your best
friend in high school or it could be 
your mother,” said Kraut. As for 
other major factors in the studies’ 
discrepancies, Kraut said “I don’t 
think the answer is in yet.” 
Problems such as the one Kraut 
and Kiesler "have chosen to 
explore can be especially chal­
lenging because the Internet is 
constantly undergoing change. 
“The Internet is a complex and 
multi-faceted social phenomenon 
and it is evolving rapidly,” said 
William Scherlis, a senior 
research scientist and director of 
the Information Technology 
Center in the School of Computer 
Science. As long as the Internet 
continues to evolve, results from 
studies similar to those conduct­
ed by Kraut and Kiesler may chal­
lenge one another.

Crime and Incident Report
Medical/Intoxication, 8/25/01,
4:17 AM - An RA of Hamerschlag House 
called Campus Police to report an intoxi­
cated male locked in a dormitory room. 
Five officers responded, and upon 
arrival, found that the said door had 
been opened and that the victim was lay­
ing on the top bunk of the bed. The vic­
tim’s roommate reported that the victim 
had consumed approximately six beers at 
a fraternity house that evening. Upon 
returning to his room, the victim had 
vomited and fallen out of his bunk, strik­
ing his head on the floor and causing 
multiple abrasions to his face. EMS 
responded and administered oxygen to 
he victim. City medics also responded, 
long with an on-duty physician. After 
'nitially refusing assistance, the victim 
greed to be transported to the hospital.
Disorderly Conduct, 8/27/01,
:07 AM - An officer at the corner of 
orbes Avenue and Beeler Street 
bserved a naked white male riding a 
icycle in the rain. The male crossed 
orbes and rode down the sidewalk 
eside the Tech Garage toward Resnik 
Touse. Three officers pursued the actor 
vho was then observed standing next to 
esnik House pulling on a pair of shorts, 
he officers approached the actor, who 
dentified himself as a Pittsburgh resi- 
ent. An officer asked the actor why he 
ad decided to ride his bicycle in the 
ain, nude, in the middle of the night on 
college campus. The actor responded 
at he did not think anyone would be 
round. An officer informed the actor 
at students were still up on campus
and pointed out that a student had just 
exited Resnik House. The actor was 
issued a PA Non-Traffic Citation for 
Disorderly Conduct.
Hazardous Condition, 8/27/01, 
6:15 PM - Campus Police received a 
report that a roll of tar paper had fallen 
off of the roof of Scaife Hall and almost 
hit someone. The informant said that it 
looked like more tar paper was about to 
fall off the roof. An officer and an FMS 
employee responded to the area. They 
learned that a male at the scene had 
been hit on the shoulder by the falling 
roll of tar paper, but that he had not 
wanted to stay and talk with the police. 
Caution tape was used to block off the 
area under the precarious tar paper rolls. 
The roofing contractor was notified of 
the situation.
Medical, 9/1/01, 1:32 AM - While 
patrolling the fraternity quadrangle, 
Campus Police received a report that per­
sons unknown were spraying pepper 
spray inside of a fraternity. Two officers 
responded to the fraternity house and 
spoke with fraternity members who said 
that a fight had broken out between 
party goers. During the altercation, two 
fraternity members had been sprayed 
directly in the face with pepper spray. 
EMS responded and both victims were 
treated. A third victim, a non-CMU stu­
dent, was treated as well. None of the 
victims required transport to the hospi­
tal.
Medical/Property Damage,
9/1/01, 1:45 AM - An officer respond­
ed to the Mudge House first floor court­
yard area for the report of a shattered 
window. Shortly after arrival, the officer 
was informed that a male student had 
just stuck his arm through the broken 
window, causing lacerations to his hand 
and forearm. The officer spoke with the 
student, who said that he had been 
drinking that evening. The victim was 21 
and did not appear to be intoxicated. The 
victim explained to the officer that he 
“had never seen a broken window 
before” and had wanted to touch the 
shattered glass. When he touched the 
window, a fragment of shattered glass 
fell and caused his multiple lacerations. 
After receiving treatment from EMS, the 
victim was transported to the hospital. 
CPS responded to the Mudge courtyard 
to clean up the glass, and FMS was noti­
fied of the broken window.
Disorderly Conduct, 9/2/01, 
2:00 AM - While two officers conducted 
a police stop in the Morewood Gardens 
circle, an individual on the 6th floor of 
the Morewood Gardens A-Tower repeat­
edly shouted obscenities at them. Three 
officer responded to the A-Tower to 
locate the individual. Officers arrived at 
the room they believed the obscenities to 
have been shouted from and found an 
individual sitting at a computer near an 
open window. Upon seeing the police, 
the male student said, “It wasn’t me. I 
didn’t do it.” The student said that anoth­
er student had yelled the obscenities and 
that he had been upset about something 
that night. The reported actor was later
apprehended at the Morewood circle.
Theft, 9/5/01, 1:03 AM-An officer 
observed two females carrying a small 
wooden end table up to the Margaret 
Morrison apartments. The actors were 
asked where they had obtained the 
wooden end table, and they both replied 
that it had come from the 2nd floor of 
West Wing. The actors said that they had 
lent the table to the ex-boyfriend of one 
of the actors but that the table belonged 
in their apartment. The ex-boyfriend was 
contacted and said that he had not given 
anyone permission to remove the table 
from West Wing. Both actors received 
Internal Citations for theft. The table 
was brought to the Campus Police 
Communication Center to log as evi­
dence.
Unauthorized Solicitation, 
9/5/01, 2:41 PM - Campus Police were 
notified of a white male, with dark hair, a 
nose ring, a white button down shirt, and 
khaki pants in Morewood Gardens solic­
iting memberships to a spa. Three offi­
cers found the male on the 6th floor of 
the B-Tower of Morewood Gardens and 
identified him as a Pittsburgh resident. 
The actor told the officers that he was 
looking for a friend that goes to CMU. 
While looking for her, he had decided to 
hand out invitations to Mason Towers 
Beauty Salon. The actor told the officers 
that he had entered the building through 
the A-Tower door with a group of stu­
dents. The actor was advised if he was 
found on the premises in the future, he 
would be arrested.
Vehicle-Pedestrian Accident, 
9/6/01, 5:27 PM - Campus Police 
received a report of a vehicle striking a 
pedestrian at the Forbes Avenue and 
Beeler Street intersection. Campus 
Police, Pittsburgh City Police, and EMS

THE TARTAN • SEPTEMBER 10, 2001
Lawsuit characterizes CMU police force as rife with “racial animus”
POLICE, from page A1
certainly aggravated by the deci­
sions of CMU’s management to 
sustain and promote the existence 
of a hostile work environment."
Underneath the charges of 
racial hatred and misuse of 
power is a more philosophical 
accusation at a University that 
prides itself on its diversity. The 
suit alleges that CMU’s manage­
ment, notably Vice President of 
Enrollment Bill Elliott, human 
resources director Barbara 
Smith, and Equal Employment 
Opportunities compliance officer 
Sanford Rivers, sustain policies 
that "achieve quota-like compli­
ance with ‘diversity’ considera­
tions by packing low-skilled posi­
tions in departments such as the 
security and dining departments 
with African American employ­
ees...thereby pay[ing] numerical 
lip service to equal employment 
opportunities." Elliott and Rivers 
are both named as defendants in 
the suit.
“Carnegie Mellon denies that 
employees in the University 
Police department have been dis­
criminated against because they 
are white or that African 
American employees have been 
favored over whites,” said Kyle 
Fisher-Morabito, associate vice 
president of University advance­
ment.
“The University believes that 
the contentions are not true and 
that it gives an inaccuarate view 
of the University Police 
Department.”
After LaPaglia’s passing, Suber 
was promoted to acting Chief of 
Police. A 13-member committee 
headed by modern languages 
professor Richard Tucker was cre­
ated to conduct a nationwide 
search for LaPaglia’s successor. 
Suber did submit her name into 
the applicant pool and was inter­
viewed, according to Tucker. On 
July 9, the committee extended 
the job offer to Creig Doyle, who 
began work August 1.
“He found out a lot about 
Carnegie Mellon and really pre­
pared himself for the interview 
and the assignment,” Tucker said 
in the Carnegie Mellon News. 
“He's exceptionally personable. 
His background gave you a sense 
that he would fit in well here.”
“It was brought to my attention 
[during the interview process] 
that there were internal issues 
that people were giving various 
labels,” said Doyle.
“I felt very comfortable with 
the issues that were mentioned to 
me. I feel that particularly Dr. 
Elliott was very forthright and 
straightforward with me as were 
other members of the administra­
tion... about everything.” He 
added that his knowledge of the
lawsuit was and still is limited to 
that information he read in a 
local newspaper dated May 31,
2001.
While an administrator in the 
Washington, D.C. and Rehoboth 
Beach Police Departments Doyle 
never encountered a racial prob­
lem that was the "basis of litiga­
tion." However, the new chief has 
experience with the management 
of equal opportunity complaints 
on the basis of gender.
Since the dawn of Doyle’s 
tenure, there have been no com­
plaints filed by an officer against 
a co-worker within the 
Department. Protocol allows for 
shift supervisors and the Director 
of Campus Security (Chief of 
Police) to conduct investigations 
into police misconduct.
During LaPaglia’s term, Budzik 
and Giran with others in the 
Department, who are unnamed in 
the suit, filed internal grievances 
against Suber. According to the 
brief, Suber relayed to CMU 
administrators that Giran was 
“manipulating records, ‘losing’ 
applications of African Americans 
for employment, guilt of theft 
[sic], and, by other means, por­
trayed Giran as a racist or a per­
son who had hatred for African 
Americans.” The suit continues 
that Suber informed inappropri­
ate parties as to the allegations.
During 1998 and 1999, Budzik
claims that Suber attempted to 
undermine her relationship with 
Budzik’s supervisors. Suber, 
motivated by "her racial hatred of 
LaPaglia," tried to convince 
Budzik that she was treated 
unfairly because of her gender, 
the complaint continues.
In January 2000 Giran docked 
White’s pay because he had 
exceeded his allotted days off 
according to the suit. "Giran’s 
attempt to simply perform her 
duty was met with a violent and 
extreme verbal outburst by 
White. Suber and White acted in 
concert to make sure that White 
would not be subject to discipline 
for this instance."
The brief continues that in an 
attempt to discuss the incident, 
White "flagrantly, publically [sic] 
and loudly flouted his insubordi­
nation and rejected LaPaglia’s 
orders regarding this instance."
Budzik, Giran, Metz, and 
LaPaglia also challenge that the 
former Chief’s disciplinary mea­
sures against White and Suber 
were rejected by Elliott and 
Smith, "who became set on allow­
ing Suber and White to act in dis­
regard [of] CMU rules and deco­
rum, because of their race."
White, who is currently on a 
month-long vacation, could not 
be reached for comment. Budzik 
and Giran, frustrated by the lack 
of resolution to the problems,
Internal campus police conflict since 1998

“Suber continues to attempt to undermine Budzik’s 
relationship with [Chief James] LaPaglia and other 
supervisors, by suggesting that these other supervi­
sors did not think Budzik was performing her job 
well, were not happy with Budzik and resented 
Budzik because of Budzik’s gender,” the suit says.
Giran and Budzik filed discrimination charges 
against CMU with the Pittsburgh Commission on 
Human Relations. The HRC dismisses the case.
After hearing about the HRC filing, the suit contends 
that “Suber, River, and Elliott and perhaps others, 
conspired to deprive LaPaglia of his position with 
MPOTEC [Metropolitan Police Officers Training and 
Education Committee] as a member of the educa­
tion committee.”
The suit also says that University ombudsman 
Everett Tademy threatened to disband the police 
force and hire an outside contractor, thus eliminat­
ing the positions of LaPaglia, Budzik, et. al.
Spring
2000
Chief James LaPaglia suddenly dies during an exer- 
cise routine. His wife charges that the pressure from 
Warner Hall to diffuse the Department’s strained 
race relations led to his untimely passing.
Lt. Suber is named acting Chief of Police.
The suit also says that one of Suber’s first decisions 
was to “purposefully schedule a target practice ses­
sion to conflict with the memorial which commemo­
rated LaPaglia’s service.”
August
2000
On May 4th, Detective Martin White, acting Chief 
Suber meet with guard Janice Metz to discuss her 
performance, according to the suit.
“During the course of the meeting in the supervisor’s 
office, Metz observed that White was her peer, not 
her supervisor and could not reprimand her. White 
stormed out of the room screaming at Metz and 
upon leaving the room, slammed a door into Metz’s 
shoulder, causing injury.”
Shortly thereafter, a lawsuit is filed in US District 
Court on behalf of Budzik, Metz, Giran, and Ms. 
LaPaglia.
May

1998
“Beginning in 1998, then Lt. Mary Suber attempts to under­
mine LaPaglia’s leadership by interjecting the view that 
LaPaglia was prejudiced when it came to matters involving 
race and gender,” specifically with the newly hired white 
Sgt. Annie Budzik.
During 1998, Suber tells CMU administrators that adminis­
trative assistant Karen Giran “was manipulating 
records, [and] ‘losing’ applications of African Americans for 
employment.”
1999Budzik and Karen file internal grievances against Suber. 
LaPaglia begins his investigation.
Jan
2000
Administrative assistant Karen Giran docked Detective Martin 
White’s pay for exceeding his allotted amount of days off, 
according to the complaint. The event led to an “extreme ver­
bal outburst by White.”
LaPaglia attempts to discipline White, but his efforts are “frus­
trated by the racially motivated decisions of Elliott and [HR 
director Barbara] Smith, who become set on allowing Suber 
and White to act in disregards of CMU rules and decorum.”
2000
According to the brief, when LaPaglia announced his findings 
that “Suber was the principal source of [racial tension],” 
White, Suber, and other blacks claimed that they “were vic­
timized by a hostile work environment.”
“LaPaglia proposed to transfer Suber or to discipline her ... 
However, he was not permitted to take meaningful steps to 
end the racial problems in the Department,” the suit says.

“When Budzik attempts to discipline an African American offi-

object of remarks from an African American officer which 
insinuates that she is having an illicit relationship with anoth­
er white male supervisor.”
Police officer Paul Helffrich files a lawsuit against Carnegie 
Mellon University, says attorney Ed Olds.

brought their complaints before 
the Pittsburgh Commission on 
Human Relations, who in turn 
dismissed the complaint.
“The City of Pittsburgh Human 
Relations Committee found that 
the evidence did not substantiate 
the allegations of discrimina­
tion,” said Fisher-Morabito.
The plaintiffs also accuse the 
University of threatening the sov­
ereignty of the CMU Police 
Department. “In fact, at a meet­
ing designed to discuss the HRC 
charges, University ombudsman 
Everett Tademy threatened 
LaPaglia, Budzik and Giran that 
CMU would disband the Campus 
Police Department altogether, 
fire its employees, and use a con­
tract safety force.”
In May 2001, White and Suber 
met with security guard Janice 
Metz to “impose warnings,” 
according to the complaint. 
“Suber allegedly had ‘problems’ 
with Metz and instructed White 
to deliver the reprimands and 
threats.” During the meeting, 
Metz stated that White was not 
permitted to admonish other 
employees. “White stormed out 
of the room screaming at Metz 
and upon leaving the room, 
slammed a door into Metz’s 
shoulder causing injury.” Under 
Doyle’s command, it appears that 
only he and the four shift supervi­
sors, Sergeants Budzik, William
Ricci, Robert Payne, and Richard 
Sima, will have the power to dis­
cipline fellow officers.
Doyle remains hopeful that the 
Police Department can resolve 
what must be a trying time in a 
division where suing parties see 
each other on a daily basis. While 
Budzik works an evening shift, 
Metz, White, and Suber all work 
daylight hours.
“What I’m trying to do is focus 
on this organization starting 
August 1,” said Doyle.
"What I’m particularly trying to 
get them [the police force] 
focused on are our six core orga­
nizational values, the number 
one organizational value being 
respect."
Doyle believes it would have 
been poor management practice 
and unfair to enter his position 
“with some preconceived notions 
that there were these factions 
and cliques in existence and go 
and seek them out on some ‘seek 
and destroy’ mission. That’s not 
what building an organization is 
about. I’m trying to provide visi­
ble, fair, consistent leadership 
that these people can develop a 
level of trust in.”
The new Chief has conducted 
confidential one-on-one meet­
ings with two-thirds of the Police 
Department and says he is intent 
on “the employee’s vision for the 
Department.”
Rumsfeld defends ABM
WASHINGTON (AP) - Defense 
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld says 
he'll recommend that President Bush 
veto a defense spending bill if it cuts 
the administration's request for mis­
sile defense.
“I just don’t believe that vulnera­
bility of the American people to bal­
listic missiles is a rational policy,” 
Rumsfeld said on “Fox News 
Sunday.” “I certainly would recom­
mend a veto to the president.”
On Friday, the Democratic-run 
Senate Armed Services Committee 
voted along party lines to cut $1.3 
billion from Bush's request for $8.3 
billion for missile defense in the fis­
cal year beginning October 1. The $7 
billion would still mark an increase 
of $1.7 billion over current spending.
The legislation also would limit 
the president’s ability to conduct 
missile defense activities that would 
violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile 
treaty with Russia.
The restrictions would require a 
special vote by Congress before any 
money could be spent on an activity 
that the president tells Congress 
would violate the ABM treaty, even if 
the United States is no longer a party 
to the pact.
“That has no chance at all of going 
into law,” Senate Republican leader 
Trent Lott of Mississippi said. But the 
chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, Democrat 
Joseph Biden of Delaware, said: 
“That position will succeed.”
The provision was part of legisla­
tion authorizing defense spending of 
$343 billion for the next fiscal year.
Rumsfeld was hopeful that when 
House and Senate bargainers resolve 
differences between the chambers’ 
military authorization bills, missile 
defense money will be restored.
“I have found over time that the 
American people care about their 
national security, they understand its 
importance, and that the Congress 
tends to be supportive,” he said.
“So I think that a presumption that 
what came out of the Senate com­
mittee will necessarily end up as the 
final decision may very well prove to 
be wrong.”
The House Armed Services 
Committee last month voted to trim 
$135 million from the missile 
defense request.
Rumsfeld said the limit on missile 
defense in the Senate committee’s 
bill “basically ties the president’s 
hands in the discussions with the 
Russians.”
“It says to the Russians that there 
are those in the Senate who are not 
willing to give the president the free­
dom to go forward with a test pro­
gram that he intends to go forward 
with,” he said. “So it’s important that 
that be defeated in the House and 
Senate.”
Bush is tiying to strike a deal with 
the Russians to replace the ABM 
treaty with an arrangement that 
allows for national missile defense.
Rumsfeld, who plans to meet later 
this month with Russian Defense 
Minister Sergei Ivanov in Italy, said 
the administration was keeping an 
open dialogue with Moscow.
“It is entirely possible that we will 
be able to find a framework that we 
can establish between our two coun­
tries that is not Cold War-oriented,” 
he said.
Rumsfeld, however, also said: “If 
we’re not able to find a framework 
that can be appropriate for our two 
countries going forward between 
now and the end of the year, the 
president has indicated he’ll have to 
give consideration to giving a six- 
month notification for withdrawal.”
White House national security 
adviser Condoleezza Rice said on 
NBC’s “Meet the Press” that “there’s 
a lot of work to do” in consulting 
with Russia, China and U.S. allies.
Administration officials plan to 
brief Chinese officials about the 
shield before Bush visits China next 
month.
Chinese officials have opposed a 
U.S. missile defense system, saying 
they believe it will upset internation­
al stability.
“Our conversations with the 
Chinese will be much like they were 
with others. It will be to tell them 
about the missile defense program, 
to be transparent about that, to con­
vince them that, in fact, it is not a 
problem,” Rice said.
Similarly, Rumsfeld told CNN: 
“We want people in the world to 
understand what we’re doing. But 
we have not proposed sharing mis­
sile defense capability with the 
People’s Republic of China.”

News Brief: 
Student dies at U. of Maryland
Klochkoff was a member of the 
fraternity and lived in the house. 
The night before he was found he 
had attended a meeting at the fra­
ternity between 8 and 10 pm and 
was last seen between 2 and 3 am.
“Several rumors, including one 
of Klochkoff having been in a fight 
Tuesday night, have not been sub­
stantiated,” said Corso. Police are 
still looking into Klochkoff’s 
whereabouts between 10 pm and
3 am. When asked if he believed 
Klochkoff’s body was found in the 
same place he passed away, uni­
versity Police Chief Kenneth 
Krouse responded, “I am not at 
liberty to say.”
Klochkoff was a letters and sci­
ences major who had transferred 
to the University of Maryland 
from Hofstra University last year. 
He was described as “a fun-loving, 
outgoing kid” by his high school 
athletic director, Mike Muscara.
“Every guy looked up to him, 
and every girl loved him,” said a 
friend who played football with 
Klochkoff for six years in junior 
high and high school and asked
A 20-year-old student at the 
University of Maryland was found 
dead early Wednesday morning 
outside of a fraternity house at 
the College Park, Maryland cam­
pus.
“The preliminary results of the 
autopsy revealed that there were 
no visible signs of injury identi­
fied that would have caused this 
young man’s death,” said Major 
Gary Corso, commander of the 
Prince George’s County Police 
Criminal Investigation Division. 
The autopsy reports also indicat­
ed that it was extremely unlikely 
that alcohol played a part in the 
student’s death. Further studies 
are being done by the State 
Medical Examiner to determine 
the final cause of death. That 
result could take up to eight 
weeks, according to police.
The student, identified as 
Alexander Klochkoff, was found 
unresponsive on the porch of the 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity 
house at 8 am Wednesday and 
was later pronounced dead at 
Washington Adventist Hospital.
not to be named. “He was super 
smart, but his dream was to play 
big-time college football.”
At the University of Maryland, 
members of Klochkoff’s fraternity 
lit candles for him on the fraterni­
ty house lawn and students on 
campus wore yellow ribbons and 
black arm bands, in honor of 
Klochkoff.
Klochkoff’s death has com­
pounded the fraternity’s recent 
problems. The College Park 
branch of Sigma Alpha Epsilon is 
on probation through November 
because of an underage drinking 
violation in October 2000, said 
John Zacker, associate director of 
judicial programs at the 
University of Maryland.
The fraternity is also under 
investigation for an underage 
drinking violation at an unautho­
rized party, Zacker said. The case 
is pending, but if it is confirmed, 
Zacker said the fraternity could 
face heavy penalties.

CMU’s tent should not be a 
permanent feature on the mall
Every year, the University erects a tent on 
the Mall and every year, this tent is left on 
the Mall for far too long, killing the grass 
below it and cluttering the area. In the 
future, the University should plan to remove 
the Orientation Tent immediately after 
Orientation Week ends.
While this eyesore sits on the Mall being 
unused, it deprives the grass beneath it of 
sunlight and air. When the tent is finally 
taken down in the middle of the semester, 
the grass it covered has died. By that time, 
colder weather and shorter days ensure that 
new grass has no chance to take root. The 
campus community is stuck with an unsight­
ly blight in a prime location on campus. In 
springtime, new grass can actually grow, but 
the area is roped off and fertilized to encour­
age that growth. This annual cycle ensures 
that for much of the school year, this section 
of the Mall is unusable.
The Orientation Tent is used extensively 
during Orientation Week for first-year stu­
dents. However, the Tent has only been used 
sporadically in the weeks after Orientation. 
This semester, only a concert by Mind’s I has 
been held in the Tent. For the remainder of 
its days, it serves no function whatsoever. 
This year, even the Student Activities Fair 
was held on the CFA Lawn instead of inside 
the Tent. If Student Affairs wishes to retain
the Tent for longer than Orientation Week, 
more efforts should be made to utilize it. 
More events should be planned for the first 
few weeks and held inside the Orientation 
Tent, rather than Rangos or the CFA Lawn.
However, Student Affairs should consider 
not renting the Tent at all, as it serves very 
little purpose. There are other, more suitable 
venues for engaging the incoming first- 
years. Both Gesling Stadium and the IM field 
are used at other times to seat and address 
large groups of people. Skibo Gym has been 
used as a rain venue for many events and 
concerts. There is no reason Student Affairs 
cannot take advantage of these locations 
better suited to their purpose. Furthermore, 
Taylor Rental, the company from which the 
University rents the Orientation Tent, has 
been slow to respond in the past and pre­
sents another reason why Student Affairs 
should cease renting the Tent every year.
The tent is even featured in a CMU post­
card. Is this really the image of Carnegie 
Mellon that we want to project? Green space 
is at a premium here; on pleasant days, 
empty lawns are quite scarce. The campus 
community must make every effort to pre­
serve and cherish the green space we do 
have. This means the Orientation Tent must 
come down so that we can enjoy the entire 
Mall, not just part.
University, housing should 
work to improve DSL service
Please expect periods of interrupted con­
nectivity between 00:07:09 until 05:43:00 
on Wednesday, August 29, 2001 due to 
router maintenance and upgrades.
Due to complications in the timing of the 
orders for your Services, as well as some con­
fusion as to the address for service, as most 
of you know, the DSL does not work.
These are the types of notices and emails 
students living in CMU Housing’s Oakland 
apartments, such as Cathedral Mansions, 
Fairfax, Webster, Shady Oaks, and London 
Terrace, have been receiving when trying to 
work online since the first day of classes. For 
students affected by these inconviences, the 
communication path between Housing and 
the students has been a twisted and difficult 
one that has left the residents with idle 
Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) modem 
equipment, DSL connection with continual 
interruptions, low speed dial-up connec­
tions, and, for many, no connection at all. 
Students are left confused and "unconnect­
ed" as a result of poor communication from 
Housing. But there are three key players in 
the quest for high-speed DSL service: 
Housing, the DSL modem equipment 
provider; Telerama, the internet service 
provider (ISP); and Verizon, the phone com­
pany.
As the DSL modem equipment provider, 
CMU Housing Services supplied check-in 
packets regarding changes that required 
Oakland residents to register and set up 
equipment and how to establish a DSL con­
nection. The information in these packets 
was clearly inadequate, as many students are 
still left befuddled as to whom to contact for 
problems or troubleshooting. In addition, 
DSL improvements have been promised via 
several email notices since August 31, but so 
far, the only changes CMU residents have 
experienced are an influx of 56K dial-up 
modems and encouragement from Housing 
Services to revert to low-speed dial-up con- 
| nections until the end of September. 
However, many CMU Housing residents 
were surprised to learn that Housing pur­
chased the 56K modems with the student’s 
first month’s DSL service fee, rather than
crediting their account for the service (or 
lack thereof).
Besides this, when and if students estab­
lish a dial-up connection they are further 
hindered by the small size of CMU’s modem 
pool, particularly during peak hours. 
Residents who have been online more than 
15 hours per week have been receiving 
warning emails from Housing telling them 
that their usage is exceeding their 
allowance.
How do telecom companies Telerama and 
Verizon fit into the picture? Telerama is 
responsible for providing the link between 
its server and CMU’s network while Verizon 
is responsible for providing Telerama with 
the DSL technology to supply high-speed 
data access over a single pair of ordinary 
telephone wires. When functioning proper­
ly, Verizon DSL should provide access speeds 
from 11 to 12 times faster than a typical 56.6 
K modem.
The root of the DSL problem may ulti­
mately be attributed to Verizon, who has 
been creating delays as the pathway 
provider. Housing has finally distributed all 
of the DSL modem equipment and has been 
emailing students timely updates on the 
efforts to resolve the current DSL service 
problems, while Telerama has set up addi­
tional links to the Internet in an effort to sig­
nificantly increase the speed of the network­
ing to campus. Verizon, however, has not 
committed to any specific dates in which 
more reliable DSL service can be expected. 
They’re merely "aiming" for further improve­
ments by the end of September. It seems as if 
these issues and high usages should have 
been anticipated and arranged for prior to 
the arrival of students. While CMU seems to 
be continually acquiring new off-campus 
apartments for students, they are not follow­
ing these acquisitions with adequate net­
work connections. If Housing expects stu­
dents to got to live in these apartments, they 
need to offer a comparable connection in 
speed and dependability to what on-campus 
students receive. Until then, these students 
would be better off just using the computers 
on campus.

U.N. conference yields parenting tips, if anything
CLHfS CST(A#0
Christian Restifo
If I didn’t know what to expect when my 
son and his soon-to-be sibling are quarrel­
ing children, I sure do know now. I think 
I’m fully prepared for the “he started 
it/did not” arguments and the “but it’s my 
turn now” cries. And I won’t lose my tem­
per when the “mine, mine, mine” shouting 
starts. So I, for one, would like to thank 
the U.N. World Conference on Racism. If I 
can handle grown adults acting like chil­
dren when it comes to serious issues, I can 
surely handle my own children fighting 
over who touched whom first.
All sarcasm aside, I find it quite sad that 
a conference dedicated to finding ways to 
deal with the pervasive and far-reaching 
problems of racism and intolerance should 
boil down to a pissing-match where 
groups attempted to out-moan each other. 
I’m almost ashamed to say I keep thinking 
of Monty Python and the Holy Grail: “Help! 
Help! I’m being repressed!”
While attempting to determine responsi­
bility is dangerous (anyone I criticize can 
claim to have carte blanche moral authori­
ty to call me a racist), we must still hold 
those people and groups accountable in 
the public forum. They were the ones who 
let the conference both fail and create more 
bad blood among nations and nationali­
ties. And I put the blame squarely on the 
non-government organizations (NGOs), 
the U.N., and, yes, the United States.
Perhaps the most blatant example of 
racism itself, NGOs did nothing to help 
the conference. During their parallel 
meeting, they broke down into a mud- 
slinging fest. Pro-Arab groups pushed the 
“Zionism is racism” issue (which, inciden­
tally, was settled many years ago by the 
U.N.), while pro-Israeli groups didn’t 
exactly provide justification for Israel’s 
arbitrary executions.
Meanwhile, other groups advanced the 
“apology and reparations” argument for 
past slavery and colonialism. Another col­
umn on these pages discusses the problems 
with reparations, so I’ll just say that cross- 
generational reparations are poindess.
Now, the existence of this parallel con­
ference in and of itself causes me no con­
cern. What I find troubling is that official 
U.N. bodies at such conferences tend to 
take up and accept, in one form or another, 
the resolutions and whatnot proposed by 
the NGOs. In essence, the U.N., a body 
whose members represent countries, 
engages in decision-making with groups 
that do not represent countries. These 
groups are not bound by complex interna­
tional relations, treaties, and histories that 
frame the debate. When that happens, you 
get the mud-slinging and immovable posi­
tions that have poisoned the conference.
True, some countries share the same 
positions as the NGOs, but these coun­
tries are realistically constrained by their 
relationships with other U.N. members. If 
an NGO gets a resolution passed that con­
tains a particularly inflammatory posi­
tion, no repercussions exist. When a 
country considers supporting a position, 
it must take into account the effects on its 
relations with other countries.
NGOs also give uneven weight to 
issues. A country can take only one stand 
on an issue, while 30 NGOs can take the 
same position on'the same issue.
I do not argue that NGOs should not 
have a parallel conference or that the UN 
should not listen to them. They do pro­
vide an important channel for opinion, 
especially for those people whose govern­
ments are not exactly democratic.
However, the U.N. should have, from the 
very beginning, taken a stand against the 
childish and unrepresentative NGO behav­
ior. Koffi Annan should have said that the 
NGO resolutions were unacceptable and 
would not be considered at all. Whether or 
not he could follow through on this demand 
is irrelevant; the moral stand matters.
The U.N. should have also worked hard­
er to separate the Palestinian/Israeli issue 
from the conference instead of letting it 
hijack and subordinate all other issues. It 
should have also worked harder to give all 
issues a level playing field. African
nations kept pushing for apologies and 
reparations from European and Western 
countries, letting their relationships with 
Arab nations conveniently hide the issue 
of Arab slavery. And let’s not forget India, 
whose caste system affects the greatest 
number of people. They received the ulti­
mate short end of the stick.
Finally, as much as I hate to say it, I think 
the United States made a critical error in. 
pulling out of the conference. I know the 
Bush administration correctly wished not 
to lend any legitimacy to the conference. 
Given behavior at the conference, howev­
er, I doubt the presence of the United 
States would have done any such thing.
But, the United States could have 
claimed a moral victory by appearing yet 
refusing to support the current confer­
ence resolutions. Repeatedly, the US 
could have said that the Middle East issue 
must be resolved separately, without the 
interference of hundreds of NGOs and 
thousands of hot tempers. Colin Powell 
could have offered to immediately open 
new talks in Durban after the conference.
Our representatives could have also 
hammered on other intolerance issues 
that are far more pervasive than the con­
flict in Israel. Sure, we would have been 
open to criticism from other countries 
about racism here, but that could have 
been easily handled. First, we could have 
borrowed a page from Canada’s playbook 
in which we acknowledged our shortcom­
ings but talked about what we’re doing. 
Secondly, we could have reminded every­
one that we don’t do things like order 
women not to go to school or permit thou­
sands of different ethic groups to take up 
machetes and hack each other to bits.
The ultimate statement would have 
been Colin Powell declaring his support 
for ending racism but refusing to sign any 
resolution that had any hint of racism 
(ironic, no?) in its language. Sure, other 
countries would have cried foul and com­
plained, but Powell would have simply 
been acting as the adult.

I Want a Wife: Not your typical TV dating game
LaRita Y. Hamilton
What does the “real” in real­
ity television mean? Real peo­
ple, real situations .... I think 
it means “real(ly) dumb.”
Fox television network will 
be sending four women to 
Alaska to find a husband 
among a pool of 40 men. Yes, 
they are going there again. 
Didn’t Rick-what’s-his-name 
and Darva Conger prove that 
it sounds nice, but it just does­
n’t work?
After the short and not-so- 
happy marriage of Darva and 
Rick was annulled, Conger 
said that she never thought 
that she would win and when 
she did, she felt pressured to 
go through with it. To her, it 
was just a free trip with no 
strings attached. She never 
thought about what it was she 
agreed to do until she was 
called on to do it. Because the 
women will be in a group, Fox 
says, there won’t be any pres­
sure for them to do anything 
rash. Rash as in marry some­
one they hardly know on TV?
In this series I Want a Wife: 
Alaska, the men will be jump­
ing through hoops to get the 
attention of the four brides-to-
be. Men will be given the 
opportunity to prove their 
worthiness through daring 
feats like standing in icy water 
for 20 minutes. I guess as long 
as the women don’t get to see 
what is going on under the 
water, the men have nothing 
to lose. I have seen what can 
happen with a tepid kiddie 
pool on a hot summer day and 
it ain’t pretty.
So of course, since this is a 
reality show, this is supposed 
to reflect how “real people” 
live. No, this is how real peo­
ple make real(ly) big jackasses 
out of themselves.
Shows like Survivor and Big 
Brother don’t phase me 
because their contestants are 
obviously in an unnatural set­
ting. In the world as I know it, 
if you vote your roommates 
off one-by-one, the last per­
son standing has a lot of rent 
to pay, not one million dollars 
to gain (before taxes!).
Shows like Who Wants to 
Marry a Millionaire and I 
Want a Wife makes marriage 
seem like a game. Having a 
successful marriage takes 
work and dedication. The 
ability to stand in icy water for 
20 minutes is a cute stupid 
human trick and all, but the 
ability to stay in a 20-year 
marriage takes more time 
than seven one-hour episodes
to build. Temptation Island 
and the Love Cruise are other 
shows of this genre that I 
think cross some lines. Hate 
the game, not the player, 
right? Is this really a game?
How about we have a show 
called Who Wants to Be the 
President? You can run for 
President and depending on 
who you have ties with you can 
manipulate the votes to ensure 
a victory. No, that wouldn’t
car and all that. All you get is a 
spouse and all their baggage. 
The great thing about dating is 
that you get to decide whether 
or not you want to deal with a 
person’s baggage, is it not? 
Cute little competitions 
designed to showcase physical 
fitness and intelligence will not 
suffice. I think the dating game 
is sport enough without 
adding cameras and colorful 
commentary. The contestants
work. Well, not again.
Getting emotionally 
involved with people for 
money seems a bit jaded. In 
defense of I Want a Wife, all 
you get if you win is a spouse. I 
don’t think you get a ring and a
Erica DiBenedetto/Art Editor
have the opportunity to get rid 
of men that propose to them 
and that they reject. That’s 
cool, I can think of some peo­
ple I would like to vote out of 
my realm of reality.
See HUSBAND, page A9

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN • SEPTEMBER 10, 2001
New reality television show asks, “Who wants to be a wife?”
HUSBAND, from page A8 
After marriage, these “city women” as Fox 
describes them will settle down for a nice 
happy marriage, not back in the city, but in 
Alaska. That’s pretty real. Settling down in a 
new city, getting a new job, and establishing 
a household with your new husband is some­
what commonplace. The process of getting to 
know your new spouse’s habits, likes and dis­
likes is pretty normal. Viewers will never see 
this part of the process. What Fox wants to 
show is four women and 40 men competing 
for each other’s attention and eventually
entering into marriage with someone that 
they met on an iceberg. Really. I’m not just 
making fun of Alaska. When the brides-to-be 
are shipped in, Fox is going to drop them off 
on an iceberg where the guys will be waiting 
for them. Titanic proved that icebergs are not 
very conducive to romance. Icebergs are 
about as romantic as lawyers, annulments, 
and becoming masturbation material to 
thousands of men across the country when 
you sell out to Playboy because you can’t get 
a job because people think you’re nuts.
That’s just the tip of the iceberg (hardy-
har-har). It seems that the more popular they 
get, reality TV shows seek to exploit people 
as much as possible. I for one know that if I 
had to eat Rocky Mountain oysters without 
seasoning, I would have to protest. Who 
doesn’t season their food? There are so many 
of these shows that after sitting here and list­
ing all that I could, I’m still drawing a blank 
(take or leave that pun).
There are very few things other than 
myself that I take so seriously. Marriage is 
pretty high up on my list of important things. 
My friends look at me as if I’d suggested they
eat a Rocky Mountain oyster with no season­
ing when I say, “Marriage is a sacred institu­
tion.” I just don’t like seeing things so per­
sonal and important being taken so lightly. 
Perhaps I’m wrong. Maybe the solid founda­
tion that a marriage needs is isolation on an 
iceberg. That is, if the glare of the TV cam­
era’s lights don’t melt it.

Part two of two: What I am fairly certain I did last summer
But, seriously...
by Sean Mintus
July 1: The kiddies want to play.
I got word of the imminent Pre- 
College/Governor’s School invasion late one 
night while sipping a Shirley Temple and dis­
cussing 19th century French poetry on the 
veranda. Quickly, I dashed out the door and 
reinforced our defenses. Excrement catapults, 
tiger pits, and antipersonnel mines were 
installed throughout the campus. The ram­
parts were manned, and the guard fires lit.
Nevertheless, the vicious teenagers tore 
through our lines and held their ground in 
Donner. It was at this point where we (I) 
made a healthy, informed, democratic deci­
sion to adopt guerrilla tactics in our (my) 
continuing effort to rid this (my) campus of 
all non-desirables. It took around five weeks 
to drive the little bastards out, but out they 
went in one mass exodus in early August. It 
seems as though all of the pathetically idle 
threats that I make a habit of spouting actu­
ally worked this time. Good riddance.
July 3-4: Want a beer? Some Aether?
Celebrating my 20th birthday was a mar­
velously frustrating experience. Still a full 
year away from legality, several years away 
from a Senate seat, and a full decade and a 
half removed from the presidency I plan one 
day to claim, I simply had nothing to do but 
invite 300 of my dearest friends to what, I’ve 
been told, was one of the greatest displays of 
intoxicated youthful vigor this bear trap of a 
school has ever seen. Thanks to a selfless 
effort by the summer occupancy of Sigma 
Nu, coupled with the musical stylings of Jim 
Graff and his hordes of Aether loyalists, a 
full-scale bender was achieved, going off 
without one hitch of which to speak.
Unfortunately, I did not expect to spend the 
remainder of the bail money I had set aside so
early on in the summer. I’m fairly certain that 
it had something to do with tossing a cinder 
block through a neighboring fraternity’s win­
dow, charging in and bludgeoning several 
members and a plastic tree with my bare fists. 
But once again, I can’t be entirely sure here. 
However, I obviously made it to midnight, 
thereby proving wrong all of my high school 
friends who always assumed I would be dead 
before my 20th. Ha.
July 10: An evening with Tom Petty.
My faith in contemporary American music 
was effectively shot to Hell during the mas­
sive (c)rap surge of the early nineties. Then 
came fluorescent pants, Boys II Men, and boy 
bands, leaving me with nothing to listen to 
but The White Album, Wish You Were Here, 
and some Creedence.
Thankfully, there are those out there who 
want nothing to do with whatever constitutes 
the “popular” music of today. And about five 
thousand of them gathered at the Starlake 
Amphitheater to celebrate the life and music 
of a man by the name of Tom. In these dark 
days of musical malady, listening to a man 
who personifies what true American rock ’n’ 
roll should be makes for one fine evening and 
reassured me that all is not yet lost.
Britney will soon become addicted to coke, 
lose her fame, and be forced to make some 
heinous porn flick of insulting obscurity. The 
Backstreet Boys will all one day realize that 
the industry is no place for geriatrics. And if 
there is a fair and loving God out there, He 
will see fit to strike down Fred Durst at His 
earliest convenience.
As the ash settles and the dust clears, it’ll 
be Tom Petty and his Heartbreakers standing 
there, belting out “Two Gunslingers” and 
pissing into the smoldering crater.
July 12: Jagr sent packing.
I love my Penguins. I’ve been watching reli­
giously for nearly fifteen years now, and I 
tend to keep close tabs on the team even dur­
ing the off season. So when Craig Patrick, 
considered one of the greatest general man­
agers in hockey history, decides to trade one 
of the most prolific scorers the league has 
ever seen for three kids with a combined four 
games of NHL experience, I more than take 
notice. I dance in the streets. Call it treason, 
but I’m glad the Czech finally got bounced.
Three more years of the most expensive 
bellyaching in the NHL isn’t going to bring 
Lord Stanley’s Cup back to the City of 
Champions. Young talent coupled with the 
veterans that should be kept: Kovalev, Straka, 
Lang, and that Mario guy most certainly will. 
I can’t wait for Jagr to put on a Capitals jersey, 
step out onto the Igloo ice and get knocked off 
his skates by the boos and hisses cascading 
down from the rafters. Hopefully, soon there­
after, whatever multiple felon the Pens pick 
up in between now and then will see fit to 
bend Jagr’s leg about ninety degrees in the 
wrong direction. At least then he’ll have 
something to complain about beyond being 
overpaid, overrated, and overshadowed by 
the greatest player of all time.
July 29: Denied again.
Surprisingly, my nomination for the Andy 
Awards was turned down for the second year in 
a row. I believe the logic behind this cruel and 
unjustified disallowance was a combination of 
my being a student, as opposed to a staff mem­
ber, and additionally, “a complete and utter ass­
hole who ruefully magnifies every undesirable 
attribute of his university.” Maybe next year.
August 11: I thought I could handle myself.
My housemates were shaken from sleep at 
around 5 am, upon hearing me beckon, 
“Sweet merciful Christ, where am I going to 
get some Thorazine at this hour?”
August 21: Utopia tarnished.
No sooner had I settled into the warm con­
fines of a schedule that demanded I wake up, 
go to work, come home, make a horrid mess 
of myself, pass out and repeat, all of you
whiny little snot-nosed freshmen had to 
come along and spoil the whole deal for me. 
Bliss had been sighted. Then, just like 
Gilligan, my tiny ship was tossed.
A mere month or so more of ascetic irre­
sponsibility and laziness would have quite 
possibly netted me the most peaceful state of 
mind ever achieved by a college student. No 
tests, no papers, no problem sets, no nothing. 
A simple job, a great group of close friends 
and cohorts, and an oversized pile of intoxi­
cants to pound through. That’s it.
Most would say that I was just distracted, 
that “real life,” whenever it returned, would 
kick me in the ass and remind me that it was 
meant to be lived in toil and commitment to 
forward progress, to a never ending contri­
bution to the greater good. Work! Produce! 
Consume! Fornicate! Foster growth! Plan for 
the future! Buy stock! Clean up! Organize! 
Repent! Abide! Save! To that I would respond 
by saying that life, in and of itself, is nothing 
more than a distraction aimed at keeping us 
from dwelling on the fact that one day not far 
from now, we’re going to die. Yep, I’m the 
happiest cynic on God’s green earth.
I’ll tell you what. The older I get, the more 
time I spend here, the more I realize that 
we’ve all been misled. Your answers aren’t in 
the books you read, the lecture halls you fre­
quent or the professors you hold in such high 
esteem. Your answers lie within the people 
sitting next to you trying to figure out what in 
the hell I’m getting at. They lie in the arms of 
whoever is eagerly awaiting your return at the 
end of the day. They lie within that blotted 
chunk of matter that keeps your skull from 
caving in. For Christ’s sake, put down this 
poor excuse for a paper and go find them.

Time to move on, forget about unnecessary slavery reparations
Timothy Lo
Last week, thousands of private 
groups descended upon South 
Africa to discuss racism on a domes­
tic and international level at the 
United Nations Racism Summit. Of 
the many issues that were dis­
cussed, one stood out as something 
that will continue to be of particular 
interest to Americans — reparations 
to Africans and African Americans 
for slavery and colonialism.
While the idea of reparations is 
not new, it is starting to move 
beyond radical forums and 
Afrocentric literature and into main­
stream academic and political 
thought. Congress has begun toying 
with the idea, as two pro-reparation 
bills have already been introduced 
in committee — the first by 
Congressman John Conyers and the 
second by Congressman Tony Hall. 
Legal experts including Johnny 
Cochran and Harvard Law professor 
Charles Ogletree make up the 
Reparations Assessment Group, an
assembly of lawyers poised to shake 
down government and big business­
es for billions of reparation dollars 
once they get the legal go-ahead 
from Congress and the courts. But it 
isn’t just the politicians and greedy 
lawyers who are interested — the 
concept of reparations is gaining 
momentum among black 
Americans. Last year, the IRS field 
office (responsible for collecting 
taxes from the region that includes 
just northern Virginia, Maryland, 
and Delaware) received 500 tax 
returns claiming slavery credits. 
When asked about reparations for 
slavery, the executive editor of 
Ebony magazine replied, “We’re not 
talking about welfare. We’re talking 
about back pay.” I propose however, 
that justifiable “back pay” to African 
Americans would not only be an 
impossible task now, but that the 
task has already been done; the debt 
has already been paid.
In examining whether or not 
there is a case for slavery repara­
tions, it is important to examine 
this public policy issue on an 
empirical level in addition to a 
moral level. There are two ques­
tions that must be answered in
order for a reparations program to 
work: Who will be paying repara­
tions and who will be receiving it? I 
don’t believe either question can be 
answered satisfactorily.
Reparations are the act of making 
right or giving satisfaction for a 
wrong or an injury and therefore 
should only be made by the party 
that has committed the wrong. 
Who is this party? The fact is that 
most of “white” America, which 
includes many Hispanics, does not 
consist of the descendents of slave 
owners or even those who benefit­
ed from slavery. And what about 
those who immigrated here? About 
14 percent of Americans today are 
either immigrants or the children of 
immigrants- that’s a pretty substan­
tial proportion of newcomers to 
blame. My father emigrated from 
China to the United States in the 
late ’60s, and my mother emigrated 
when she was a teenager. I do not 
feel any particular ancestral guilt. 
Neither should the descendants of 
the 359,528 Americans who died in 
the struggle to eliminate slavery 
from the United States. The debt 
was paid in part by blood. The rest 
was paid by money.
Reconstruction, for the most 
part, failed. Former slaves never 
received the promised forty acres 
and a mule. If money had been 
given to blacks then, the following 
century might not have seen the 
degrading poverty and segregation 
that African Americans faced. But 
since both slaves and slave owners 
are now dead, the opportunity is 
lost. However, for the past 150 
years, America has been compen­
sating for the errors of their ances­
tors. Starting as early as 1865, the 
Freedman’s Bureau provided food 
and clothing and taught blacks how 
to read. In the last 40 years alone, 
America has targeted the black 
underclass with over 6.1 trillion 
dollars in anti-poverty spending. In 
addition, blacks have been given 
preferences in job placements, con­
tracts, and educational admissions. 
To many reparation supporters, this 
is not enough. But one must ask 
then: Who today is entitled to 
receive reparations?
In cases like the Holocaust and 
the Japanese-American internment 
camps, payments of reparations 
were given directly to victims of the 
injustice or their immediate family.
This is not the case with African 
Americans today. Justice could not 
permit that. Some may even argue 
that the concept of reparations is 
racist in and of itself. As Deroy 
Murdock wrote in an article which 
appeared in last month’s edition of 
The American Enterprise, “if it’s 
wrong for a cop to eye a black man 
and consider him a criminal, it is 
equally wrong for a Treasury offi­
cial to see that same black man and 
regard him as deserving of a check.” 
Reparations to African Americans 
for slavery are unfair, unfeasible, 
and unjust.
In a society that is already too 
racist, where it is a hate crime for a 
white man to poke fun at a black 
man, reparations would only fuel 
the fire that has caused self-segrega­
tion and bitterness on both sides. 
True “repairing” of American unity 
will not take place if the current 
notion of reparations to African 
Americans for slavery is made into a 
reality. The fact is, that the debt has 
been paid. It is time to move on.

Tennis serves as escape 
from traditional sports
Yinzer Yak
by Brad Grantz
A funny thing happened on my 
way to College Football Saturday. 
In between the constant search for 
Beano Cook’s witticisms and the 
splendid dreams of Lee Corso 
wearing a Columbian necktie, I 
abruptly, and without warning, 
became fascinated by a subject that 
for years had served no other pur­
pose than to lull me into a deep 
slumber in front of the television 
on an uneventful Saturday after­
noon. I have become liberated 
from the doldrums of sports radio 
and its incessant discussion of the 
“true” sporting competitions. I 
have lived in the dark side for 
years, my brethren. In what was 
just a noble Friday night attempt to 
find entertainment in the ranks of 
late night talk shows, I became... a 
tennis fan. While watching the 
Friday highlight reel, I became 
transfixed by the drama. The 
orchestra music recalled images of 
John Milton in Paradise Lost or 
General George Patton marveling 
at his war machine dismantling the 
Germans in the North African 
desert in the Hollywood classic, 
Patton. I viewed tennis as an epic 
struggle between two titans who 
fought mightily to prevent this 
small yellow ball of fuzz from 
escaping their encampments 
demarked by skinny white lines.
I watched with intent normally 
reserved for General Patton and 
those with dementia (or are they 
one and the same?). The game 
evolved from a simple sporting 
event to a noble defense of one’s 
territory. Tennis was not about the 
player with the greater wing span 
or faster serve, but was a story of 
honor and love of one’s country or 
backcourt. I watched in pure mar­
vel at the use of energy displayed 
with every stroke of the tennis 
racket. The silence of the event was 
only broken by the racket’s swoosh 
and the grunts and screams of the 
competitors exclaimed on every hit 
of the tennis ball.
With the purpose of tennis firm­
ly entrenched in my wicked mind, I 
began to compare the competition 
to the beloved mainstream sports 
and have developed a list of rea­
sons why tennis may be the great­
est display of pure competition.
1. No trades. The economics of 
baseball, football, et cetera, have 
created some terrible aftershocks. 
Players change uniforms faster 
than a sitcom character trying to be 
in two places at once. Fans don’t, 
identify with the hometown team 
when today’s star is tomorrow’s 
enemy. I realized that in tennis, 
one can rally behind a player with 
all their faults. Tennis permits and 
encourages individuality, while in 
the usual scenario fans follow a 
team — a band of persons that dis­
play collective personality. There 
are no individuals on a team and 
normally, fans despise such charac­
ters (i.e., Deion Sanders).
2. The ball. Every game uses
some neutral instrument as a 
means to an end. In football ath­
letes transport the pigskin for the 
explicit purposes of moving said 
object to a scoring zone.
Only in golf is there a positive 
connection between the athlete 
and the scoring apparatus. In ten­
nis, the ball is as much an enemy as 
the opponent. It receives hospitali­
ty comparable to that a rodent or 
hand grenade might receive.
3. The camaraderie. Prior to 
the match, the contestants conduct 
their warm up against each other. 
In other sports, the fan is led to 
believe that the two competitors 
are enemies; for example, that the 
Red Sox really hate the Yankees or 
that the Browns are repulsed by the 
Steelers. Since players gain more 
frequent flyer miles than a drug 
runner, there is no absolute hatred 
amongst the competitors.
Heck, they enjoy each other’s 
company so much in football that 
the players formed a union. Tennis 
doesn’t attempt to coat the compe­
tition with some misplaced idea 
that the participants are in fact 
polar opposites — good versus evil.
I saw tennis players as two field 
generals who at the end of the day 
respected their counterpart and his 
abilities enough to shake hands.
4. The matchup. I once 
believed that the purest form of 
individual competition rested in 
the battle between pitcher and bat­
ter. If Mr. Corso were not tongue- 
tied (I have since blurred the lines 
between my fantasies and reality), 
at this point he would add a “Not so 
fast, my friend.” A meeting 
between a great hurler and a Triple 
Crown batter is most likely dictated 
by the current status of the game 
(or the cumulative result of every 
other pitcher-batter encounter).
In football, the individual 
matchup of any two opposing play­
ers is lost in the intricacies of the 
West Coast Offense or more likely, 
the simple brutality of a beast pile- 
driving the quarterback into the 
hardened turf.
It’s a wonder that humanity has 
progressed so rapidly. In 2000 
years, we’ve moved on from the 
blood sport of gladiators battling 
wild animals to the blood sport of 
gladiators with shoulder pads bat­
tling wild animals.
Although I still possess the atten- 
tion-deficit disorder that hinders 
my ability to watch any sporting 
event in its entirety, I can now look 
forward to a weekend of tennis 
without falling asleep. After such 
an educational weekend, only two 
questions remain: How do they 
score the blasted game, and are the 
matches between Venus and 
Serena really fixed by their father?

Tartan football puts on clinic in UAA win
Case running back Brandon McDowell has a slight problem penetrating the Tartan defense. The Tartan defense held McDowell to 53 net yards and no TDs.
Women’s soccer undefeated in three matches
The women find themselves in what
SOCCER, from page A12 
fray.
The Tartans are now 3-0, having 
taken a 1-0 victory against 
LaRoche College this past 
Saturday Their first win of the sea­
son came two weekends ago on 
Saturday, when Carnegie Mellon 
thoroughly demolished Pitt- 
Greensburg in football fashion, 
9-0.
In the Wednesday game against 
Allegheny, the Tartans exhibited a 
steady dominance, keeping offen­
sive pressure on the ball through­
out the game and playing stingy 
defense. The intense concentration 
in the eyes of midfielder Melissa 
McMorrow could have burned a 
hole in the turf, and McConnochie 
never hesitated to get her feet tan-
has been a familiar position this season 
gled up with a ballhandler. The 
Tartans controlled on offense, 
encircling the opponents’ defend­
ers and goal, passing the ball 
methodically across the span of the 
field, waiting to pounce on an 
opportunity.
The Tartans hit paydirt with 
26:10 remaining in the first half, 
off of a corner kick by sophomore 
Allison Muehe. Junior defender 
Kelly Bloomquist deflected the kick 
past the Allegheny keeper for the 
first goal of the game, and what 
proved to be all that the Tartans 
needed. According to head coach 
Heather Kendra, Bloomquist has 
been key for the team so far, having 
scored four goals out of the back so
far this season.The second goal came 35 min-
- putting the ball in the net. 
utes into the first half, when 
McMorrow’s corner kick curved 
like a banana and swooped in over 
the leaping keeper’s hands for an 
unassisted score.
“Melissa McMorrow has been 
outstanding in the middle,” said 
Kendra. “She also serves as a major 
playmaker for us.”
Junior goalkeeper Maya Nigrosh 
contributed seven solid saves to the 
cause, and received a hearty 
applause when she came out of the 
game with 13 minutes remaining. 
First-year Megan Monroe came in 
and proceeded to make three 
important saves in the remaining
minutes.“They forced us to play faster 
than we have yet,” said Kendra. 
“And it was great to see the team
stand up under that pressure.” The 
Tartans had lost to Allegheny the 
past two years, and were happy to 
put this win under their belt.
In this last Saturday’s game 
against LaRoche, the Tartans were 
looking for revenge as well, having 
lost to them in the last meeting last 
season. The Tartans outshot 
LaRoche 21-3, had 10 corner kicks, 
and hit the post numerous times, 
but didn’t manage to score until 
late in the second half, on a cross 
into the box by junior midfielder 
Susan Pevovar. McMorrow finished 
the sequence, redirecting the ball 
into the net for the Tartans’ only 
goal of the game. McMorrow has 
now scored in every game of the 
season. It was all the Tartans need­
ed, as they held on strong for the 
victory.
“In the past we’ve certainly 
struggled against opponents like 
them,” said Kendra, “and dropped 
our level and not been able to fin­
ish. That’s the main difference 
between this year and past teams.”
For now, the team is still adjust­
ing to its new versatility on offense, 
which allows it to change between 
a lineup of four forwards, four mid­
fielders, and two backs, or four for­
wards, three midfielders, and three 
backs.
Kendra feels the former “leaves 
us a little vulnerable in the back,” 
but “they’re doing a great job of 
sorting things out and sort of tak­
ing it day by day.”
Kendra also commends the 
defense on goal. “The fact that our 
goal keeping has been consistent 
has been a large factor in our suc­
cess so far,” said Kendra.The Tartans go up to Grove City
this Wednesday, and look to keep 
their season undefeated. But make 
no mistake, the only team in the 
Tartans’ sights is Grove City.
“In the past we have let some 
teams get by us,” said Kendra. “This 
year we’re just focusing on the 
team at hand, and getting it done.”
CASE, from page A12 
defensive stop and scrapped up a 
speedy 36 second drive to capital­
ize before the half expired, with 
just 13 seconds left on the clock. 
Zimpfer threw a 23 yard perfect 
ball right into the hands of junior 
Sebastian Smelko for the touch­
down. After Palmer’s kick, it was 
35-0 to end the first half.
“I’m glad that we have such an 
experienced bunch of guys,” 
Lackner said. “It’s a great advan­
tage to have such a veteran group 
out there on the field. With almost 
everyone back, they’re playing 
more prepared, calm, and cool.”
The experience showed, espe­
cially in the two outstanding offen­
sive performances by Zimpfer and 
Smelko. Zimpfer ended the game 
with 140 yards passing and 52 
yards rushing, but the real 
strength was in his poise and deci­
sion making.
As for Smelko, he got the job 
done in nearly every offensive 
position: receiver, quarterback, 
kick returner, and even field goal 
holder. The multi-faceted player 
seemed to be all over the field.
The list doesn’t end there. Many 
other players added to the talented
rnctpr for fhp Tartan«; IIrhanr7.vk
was another example, as he scored 
his third touchdown of the day and 
the final one for CMU with 8:38 
remaining in the fourth quarter. 
He’s well on his way to picking up 
right where he left off last year in 
becoming the go-to guy on the goal 
line.
Case Western scored in the third 
quarter with a 50 yard pass from 
sophomore Eli Grant to McDowell, 
and in the fourth quarter with 
another pass from Grant, this time 
a 16 yard completion to first-year 
Dave Kallevig.
That rounded out the scoring, 
bringing the game total to 42-14 in 
favor of the Tartans. Clarke led all 
rushers with 68 yards on the 
ground, senior Matt Saneholtz led 
CMU in receiving with 46 yards 
from three catches, and junior 
Nick Cecchini led all tacklers with
4 hits on the day.
Despite this tremendous win, 
the Tartans have no time to bask in 
the glory of victory. Now they need 
to shift their attention to Bethany 
College, a team against which the 
Tartans seek to avenge themselves
for last year’s loss.“Bethany has a very strong full­
back as well as a transfer quarter­
back that seems to be verv Droduc-
tive,” said head coach Rich for us.”
Lackner. “We’re really going to Look for the Tartans in action

The skinny: Bethany plays in 
the ever-challenging President’s 
Athletic Conference, anchored by 
the 13th ranked Washington & 
Jefferson Presidents. After a con­
vincing victory at Gesling last year, 
the Bisons finished the season 2-5 
and ended the year 5-5 overall and
1-3 in the PAC. Bethany rushed for 
over 200 yards against CMU in
2000 and return 16 starters from 
last year’s squad. This year, the 
defense has allowed seven points 
in two games.
Watch for: RBs Brandon
Isabell and Nick Anderson disman-
tled the Tartan defense last year. 
All-conference player Isabell didn’t 
return to the team this year, but 
Anderson has led Bethany in rush­
ing through two games despite not 
having a 100 yard effort. Junior 
Jeremy Laceria, a transfer from 
Geneva College, has solidified the 
QB position. No one on the 
Bethany defensive line has distin­
guished themselves on a unit that 
lost standout nose tackle Joe 
Conforti.
Result: Payback will be in the 
air as the Tartans try to avenge last 
season’s disheartening defeat. This 
may be the first real test for both 
teams. The Bisons will learn 
whether their running game is 
able to withstand the loss of 
Isabell.
The Tartans will find out just 
how far Eric Zimpfer can take the 
team with an offense that cries 
run-first* but is beginning to utilize 
the pass to the tight end and back- 
field. Tartans win, 24-14.

Merry McConnochie soared

landed with a thud several feet past 
her opponent, on her back, and

stopped, and as she made her way 
back into the mix, she looked over 
at the Tartan bench.
“Don’t worry, Merry,” yelled her

Women’s volleyball dominates home tourney

Last Saturday, CMU took on 
Ohio rival Case Western Reserve 
University, and ran away with a 
commanding 42-14 win. After the 
stomping that CMU delivered the 
previous week to Randolph-Macon 
University, there probably wasn’t a 
person in the campus community 
that didn’t expect big things from 
the team this week. The Tartans 
put together a stellar game and 
decided that they weren’t going to 
disappoint.
Opening the conference sched­
ule with a team like Case Western 
was no simple task for the Tartans. 
The Spartans have 12 returning 
starters, and a solid running back 
in sophomore Brandon McDowell, 
who actually had transferred from 
Division III powerhouse Mount 
Union College.
However, the Tartans did not 
seem concerned with any of that, 
as they drew first blood right away. 
After electing to receive the ball, 
they had no trouble marching right 
down the field and scoring on the 
first drive.
Sophomore running back 
Ricardo “The Spark” Clarke 
capped off the drive with a 12-yard 
scamper, and sophomore Michael 
Palmer booted it through the 
uprights to provide an early 7-0 
CMU lead.
The next CMU score did not 
come until the beginning of the 
second quarter. This time junior 
Adam Urbanczyk busted across the 
goal line with a two yard plunge 
that was set up beautifully by a 21 
yard pass from senior Eric Zimpfer 
to junior Scott Jubeck. Palmer 
kicked it through to make the score 
14-0 in favor of the Tartans.
The Tartans struck again with 
2:25 remaining in the second quar­
ter. It was a slow, methodical drive 
that finally ended after 14 plays on 
another 2 yard run by Urbanczyk. 
The extra point by Palmer made
Adam Urbanczyk (#35) heads for the end zone in Saturday’s game against Case Western. Urbanczyk would post three rushing TDs on the day, racking up 30 rushing yards and 6 passing yards.
If there were any doubts about 
the intensity of the women’s vol­
leyball team, they were swept 
away as the squad steamrolled 
through their competition at this 
weekend’s Carnegie Mellon 
Invitational, easily running away 
with a first-place finish.
The defending Eastern College 
Athletic Conference (ECAC) 
champs were coming off a narrow 
win Wednesday night against the 
Indiana University of Pennsylvania 
(IUP) Indians, and came into the 
tourney with something to prove.
“The competition was much 
weaker this weekend,” said head 
coach Julie Webb. “We needed to 
do well at this level to prepare for 
teams like Emory and Wash U, who 
are nationally ranked.”

THE TARTAN
Writer experiences Japanese culture during internshipExhibit displays original collection of artistic work
can be found at CMU, and partly 
of data analysis and reporting. I 
learned a little bit about steels, 
but the real learning experience 
dealt a lot more with the 
Japanese way of life. It was evi­
dent to me that the company can 
really run a person’s life in Japan. 
Housing, meals, and transporta­
tion (via bicycle) were all pro­
vided by the company to most of 
its employees, and in response 
employees seemed quite dedi­
cated to the company. A work 
day for the average employee 
was over 10 hours long, a con­
cept as foreign to Americans as 
overtime pay is to the Japanese. 
Of course, the most fun and 
interesting experiences did not 
come on the job.
Although I was the only foreign 
intern working in Himeji city, 
IAESTE brought about 30 stu­
dents into southern Japan, and 
organized events for them on 
most weekends. Such events 
included trips to historic and cul­
tural sights such as Uji Temple 
(featured on the back of the ten 
yen coin), traditional ethnic 
events such as the tea ceremony, 
and other ways to have fun while 
being exposed to some Japanese 
culture in addition to meeting 
students from around the world. 
Indeed, meeting others with a 
native English tongue was a wel­
come relief at times, and a signif­
icant benefit to taking part in 
such events.
On the lighter side, here are a 
few words about vending 
machines in Japan. They are 
everywhere! And they sell just 
about everything except snack 
food. One can find soft drinks, 
coffee (hot or cold), hot entrees 
(rice and curry in a ceramic dish, 
a real meal), ice cream, ciga­
rettes, cameras and batteries, 
beer (not just cans, I’m talking 2 
liter glass jugs as well!). Finally,

tents unknown that cost over $6

This story is being written in the 
port city of Himeji, located in 
southeast Japan. I am a senior 
materials science major at 
Carnegie Mellon University who is 
nearing the end of a two month 
internship in the land of the rising 
sun. Read on for the story of how I 
did it, and you yourselfcould have 
a summer like no other.
Late last fall I, Colin Hinde, 
was thinking of my goals for my 
final summer before graduation. 
I decided that I would really like 
to do some international travel, 
but I also felt that I ought find a 
relevant internship, both for 
financial and career-related 
motives. So my search began by 
contacting several professors at 
various foreign universities to 
inquire into the possibility of par­
ticipating in research that sum­
mer. While no one took the offer 
directly, a professor at the 
University of Reykjavik told me 
that he normally hires a student 
for the summer through IAESTE, 
the International Association for 
the Exchange of Students for 
Technical Experience. I investi­
gated this organization and 
found that it is a 50 year-old asso­
ciation involving the swapping of 
students for technical internships 
from over 70 countries commit­
ted to enhancing international 
understanding through the 
exchange of culture and technol­
ogy. I applied for an internship 
post-haste, -and a few months 
later arrived in Osaka.
The actual work that was 
expected of me was nothing 
beyond the realm of expectation, 
even if almo.st everything else 
about the workplace was. The job 
involved research and develop­
ment of stainless steels for Sanyo 
Special Steel Co. It consisted 
partly of lab work, using 
machines and techniques that

was doing well as an elementary

Year’s Eve of that same year, 
Kristin’s parents returned home to 
find their only child dead of a self- 
inflicted gunshot wound to the 
head. The journal Kristin left next 
to her body revealed the awful 
truth that had driven the 20-year- 
old to take her own life: Only 
months earlier, she had been raped 
by a fellow lifeguard whom she had 
known and trusted for two years.
“Kristin’s Story” was told last 
Thursday in Rangos Hall by
Kristin’s mother, Andrea Cooper, as 
a sexual assault and depression 
awareness presentation. The pro­
gram was organized by the sisters 
of Delta Delta Delta and included a

Aggression Defense Program and 
information from Dr. Cynthia K.

MILLER, from page B1 
Edinboro University of 
Pennsylvania. Perspective com­
bines his skills as an artist and 
animator in digital media form.
Used to creating the three- 
dimensional worlds of video games 
which are shown on a two-dimen­
sional monitor, Warne wanted to 
create a three-dimensional virtual 
world and display it in a three- 
dimensional space. His animations 
are based on pictures, floorplans, 
architectural drawings, elevations, 
and sections of the Miller Gallery’s 
second floor space. There are three 
independent, but coordinated, 15- 
minute animations. They are pro­
jected from the north, south, and 
west of the space, which creates 
“projections in the round.”
Aether is found on the third floor 
of the Miller Gallery and features 
the work of five artists. The works 
are based on the artists’ ideas con­
cerning the ethereal. Included in 
the exhibit are two transparent 
paintings by Meyers; Scape, by 
Jenkins, a site-specific work that 
took three weeks to create; geomet­
ric sculptures by Mendelson; 
Stremple’s glass prisms on metal 
tripods; and Villinski’s sculptural 
poems of discarded gloves.
Meyers first organized the travel­
ing exhibit and said, “The five
artists in this show give form and 
weight to that which may be invisi­
ble and intangible. These artists do 
not attempt to illustrate their ideas 
about the aether; instead, each 
one, through his or her own visual 
language, investigates what either 
feels like, its chaos or order, our 
human longing to go there, and 
how one might make that journey.” 
These exhibits opened on August 
28 and will run through October 
14. The gallery hours are Tuesday 
through Sunday from 11:30 am to 
5 pm. For more information, visit

Kristin Rebecca Cooper’s mother, Andrea Cooper, presented “Kristin’s Story” in an effort to raise awareness about 
rape and the problems that can develop after it has happened.
“Kristin’s Story” informs all of the 
prevalence of rape and depression
COOPER, from page B1 
many never reveal the incident to 
anyone. Andrea Cooper firmly 
believes that had Kristin sought 
counseling for the assault, she 
might be alive today, a message 
that she has promoted during her 
talks at over 80 colleges.
Kristin’s friends who knew of 
the rape urged her to report the 
incident to the police and seek 
treatment, but she refused. When 
Kristin finally gathered up the 
courage to tell her boyfriend, he 
broke up with her. Already suffer­
ing from clinical depression, 
Kristin was devastated. The
Coopers assumed that their 
daughter’s moodiness had some­
thing to do with the breakup, but 
urged her to try and move on with 
Her life. Although Kristin had 
many of the signs of depression — 
which include sleep disturbance, 
fatigue, impaired concentration, 
and loss of interest in daily activi­
ties — she never sought outside 
help, despite the many resources 
available to her. Here at Carnegie 
Mellon, there are also many 
resources for victims of sexual 
assault or to help any individuals 
who think they may be suffering 
from depression (such as 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services at 8-2922, or Sexual 
Assault Advisors at
saadvise@andrew.cmu.edu). 
£)uring the past year alone, 775 
students visited Counseling 
Services, 136 of whom were diag­
nosed as having clinical depres­
sion (CMU is also no stranger to 
suicide — there have been 8 in the 
past decade). Andrea Cooper 
stressed how important it is to 
keep a close eye on individuals
who have been victims of assault 
or may be suffering from mental 
illness — in Kristin’s case, nearly 
all of her 40-some sorority sisters 
were aware of the rape, and one 
friend even remembered Kristin 
mentioning that she was going to 
kill herself.
To someone who has been 
assaulted, it’s not essential that 
they tell their parents or signifi­
cant others if they don’t feel 
comfortable doing so, but it’s 
crucial to the healing process 
that they tell someone, Mrs. 
Cooper advised. She also added 
that if the victim doesn’t feel 
comfortable with acertain thera­
pist, they are always free to 
request another counselor or ask 
for a referral elsewhere. 
“Kristin’s Story” also included 
tips for people who are helping 
others cope with assault, namely 
to listen without judgment and 
remain patient and understand­
ing. Kristin’s mother recom­
mended the book Recovering 
from Rape by Linda E. Ledray as 
an excellent rape survival 
resource for both victims and 
their support systems.
Assault prevention and legal 
options were other topics highlight­
ed during the presentation. CMU’s 
R.A.D. program, which began in 
1988, teaches self-awareness and 
risk reduction. Classes will be 
offered sometime before 
Homecoming in October and 
again towards the end of 
February; detailed information 
will be posted in residence halls 
and some academic buildings 
about one month prior to each pro­
gram. In terms of the legal implica­
tions of sexual assault, Mrs. Cooper
reminded the audience that just 
because a woman doesn’t say ‘no’ 
doesn’t give men the right to 
interpret that as a ‘yes.’ For 
instance, sex that occurs with a 
woman who is too drunk to give 
her consent is considered rape in 
all 50 states. It’s also crucial that 
women are aware of their rights 
and responsibilities should they 
decide to file criminal charges 
against the assailant — Andrea’s 
mother recalls feeling sick when 
she was told that there was no 
way to prosecute her daughter’s 
rapist despite knowing exactly 
who he was because Kristin was 
not alive to testify against him.
Andrea Cooper defined rape as 
“a crime of the heart for the victim 
and a crime of convenience for the 
perpetrator.” “Kristin’s Story” put 
a name and a face to the crime of 
rape. Kristin Cooper could just as 
easily have been a friend, a stu­
dent, a girlfriend, or a sister of any 
single person who attended the 
presentation. Through sharing 
her daughter’s experience, Mrs. 
Cooper hoped to inform both men 
and women of the prevalence of 
sexual assault and depression, 
and to reassure them that nobody 
has to go through either recovery 
process alone.

Nobel laureate Robert Merton inaugurates new Distinguished Lecture Series
by Rob Fetterman
Business Editor
Last Thursday, Nobel laureate and 
Harvard University professor Robert C. 
Merton inaugurated a recently estab­
lished distinguished lecture series spon­
sored by Carnegie Mellon’s Center for 
Computational Finance. Merton deliv­
ered his lecture entitled “Observations on 
Finance Theory and Finance Practice” as
Shaina McGrath/Co-Photo Editor
Merton shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in eco­
nomics for his work on options pricing.
Downtown
convention
the first in the center’s Nash Distinguished 
Lecture Series in Quantitative Finance. 
Merton’s hour-long talk, held in the 
University Center’s McConomy 
Auditorium, centered on the reconcilia­
tion of finance theory with finance prac­
tice in an era of rapidly evolving technolo­
gies and burgeoning global markets.
The event began with opening remarks 
from the director of the Center for 
Computational Finance (CCF) David 
Heath and University President Jared 
Cohon. In his comments, Heath 
explained the central goal of the lecture 
series is to bring top researchers to cam­
pus to encourage greater interaction 
between faculty and practitioners. 
Cohon followed by introducing Merton as 
the “perfect first Nash lecturer” and laud­
ing his contributions to finance theory 
and practice.
In his lecture, Merton discussed the 
importance and usefulness of finance the­
ory in finance practice, particularly in the 
expanding global market. He offered this 
metaphor, “You have two countries, A and 
B, who want to join their pipelines. 
Country A’s pipeline is in the shape of a 
triangle and country B’s is that of a 
square.” Merton went on to explain that 
though each country would prefer the 
other rip out their existing “pipeline” and 
rebuild it to allow an easy connection, it 
would be more sensible to build an effi­
cient adaptor to join the pipelines. “This 
is what has been going on in the global 
financial market: the building of these
efficient adapters to allow different sys­
tems to interact.”
Merton further elaborated on the use of 
both technology and theory in the con­
struction and implementation of these 
adapters. He then introduced five exam­
ples of usefulness of finance theory in 
real world applications. Merton conclud­
ed his lecture by expressing his excite­
ment for the “interesting times” that lie 
ahead in the evolving realm of global 
finance.
Merton, the John and Natty McArthur 
University Professor at the Harvard 
Business School, is best known for his 
work with fellow economist Myron 
Scholes and Fischer Black in the develop­
ment of a mathematical formula for the 
pricing of options (the right to buy one 
share of a given stock at a specified price 
and time) and other derivatives securities 
in the early 1970s. Their collaboration, 
now commonly known as the Black- 
Scholes option pricing formula, provided 
a solution for the important practical 
problem of finding a fair market price for 
a call option. This allowed traders to 
develop strategies that could take the risk 
out of buying and selling stock options 
and use them to hedge their portfolios 
against the effects of sudden shifts in the 
market. In fact, using their formula, it 
became possible to construct a portfolio 
that is virtually risk-free. This helped trig­
ger an explosion in the trading of options, 
futures contracts, and other derivatives 
worldwide, encouraging the growth of a

Merton delivered his lecture to a packed 
McConomy Auditorium Thursday afternoon.
host of new securities markets and, in 
effect, creating an entirely new industry. 
Since then, financial managers have real­
ized that Merton’s formula could also be 
applied to a breadth of contractual agree­
ments ranging from the prepayment of 
mortgages to the evaluation of student 
loan guarantees.
In 1997 the work on the option pricing 
formula earned Merton and Scholes the 
Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in the 
Economic Sciences. The prize committee 
also recognized Black, whose death in 
1995 made him ineligible to share the 
honor.
Beyond his work as a pioneer in the sci­
ence of finance, Merton, who earned his 
bachelor of science degrees in engineer­
ing and mathematics from Columbia 
University and his master’s degree in 
applied mathematics from California 
Institute of Technology, has served in both 
academia and corporate America. After 
receiving a PhD in economics from 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 
1970, he joined the finance faculty of 
MIT’s Sloan School of Management until 
1988 when he moved to Harvard. From 
1988-1992, Merton served as a senior 
advisor to Office of the Chairman at 
Salomon, Inc. In 1993, he co-founded 
Long-Term Capital Management and 
served as a principal until 1999. From 
1999 to 2001, he was a senior advisor to 
J.P. Morgan & Company. Merton is also 
the past President of the American

for young professionals
by Gautam Jain
Junior Staffwriter
If young professionals had the 
desire to voice their opinions or 
had certain visions about their soci­
ety, here at imPAct they experi­
enced the chance to reveal it to the 
authority. Billed as Pennsylvania’s 
first statewide young professionals’ 
convention, imPAct was hosted at 
the Omni William Penn Hotel from 
September 7 through 9. It was one 
of the biggest undertakings of 
Pittsburgh Urban Magnets Project 
(PUMP) since its inception in 
February 1,1999 when it organized 
the “High Road to Harrisburg,” a 
bus caravan of 100 young adults, 
who traveled to Harrisburg to 
speak with legislators about the 
importance of raising the capital 
debt ceiling.
The imPAct convention attracted 
more than 500 people, largely from 
the Pittsburgh region. A number of 
students from Carnegie Mellon and 
the University of Pittsburgh were 
also in attendance. The main event 
in this conference seemed to be the 
ten convention sessions that were 
scheduled for Saturday with topics 
such as “Politics 101”, “Health and 
Wellness”, and “Who wants to be a 
Millionaire in PA?” All these ses­
sions educated attendees on issues 
regarding personal lifestyle, state
policy issues, and work force tech­
nology.
Also on Saturday was a keynote 
speech by James Carville, cam­
paign manager to former President 
Clinton. In his address, Carville 
urged listeners to “speak up” if they 
want their opinions heard. 
“Politicians,” he said, “do not hear 
silent people. If you make noise, 
they’ll hear you... If you care about 
something passionately, raise hell.”
On Sunday, a job fair was held, 
which included some 80 pro-multi­
national firms from across
Pennsylvania. This provided the 
attendees with the opportunity to 
speak to various organizations con­
cerning career prospects and to 
present their resume credentials. 
Attendees also had the rare oppor­
tunity to nework with some of 
Pennsylvania’s local politicians — 
among them, Mayor Tom Murphy, 
county Chief Executive Jim Roddey 
and state Rep. Jeff Coleman, a 
Republican from Apollo — and dis­
cuss a number of critical issues. The 
imPAct convention had other 
attractions including a Friday night 
outdoor concert at Market Square, 
a happy hour at The Andy Warhol 
Museum, a cocktail party at night­
club “M,” and a party at the 
Carnegie Science Center’s new 
Sports Complex.
imPAct achieved its objective of 
educating young Pennsylvanians
regarding statewide issues and suc­
cessfully promoted opportunities 
to engage in public policy, commu­
nity and recreational activities, and 
career networking. Sponsored by 
PUMP along with National City 
Bank, Deloitte Consulting, and sev­
eral other companies. For PUMP, 
imPAct proved that an impact can 
really be made even if only a few 
people with common aspirations 
come together and voice their opin­
ions.
PUMP, the event’s organizer, is a 
city advocacy group for 
Pittsburgh’s young professionals. 
Its was formed in 1995 when 
Michelle Fanzo, a graduate student 
at the University of Pittsburgh, 
wrote an op-ed piece for the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In her 
piece, Fanzo opined that, as her 
friends finished grad school, too 
many were leaving the region in 
search of both career opportunities 
and more dynamic, vibrant cities. 
Michelle received calls from several 
young people who shared her con­
cerns. They began meeting in small 
groups throughout Pittsburgh’s 
East End. Through their efforts 
PUMP was created to halt the exo­
dus of young people from 
Pittsburgh and give young profes­
sionals a voice in important region­
al decisions. Today, PUMP has 
around 500 members ranging in 
age from 19 to 50.

US shifts on Microsoft breakup
(AP)—The The about-face wasn’t totallyWASHINGTON 
Bush administration, reversing 
the Clinton White House legal 
strategy against Microsoft, told 
the software manufacturer 
Thursday it no longer seeks to 
have the company broken up. 
The department also said it 
will not pursue the bundling 
issues in its protracted 
antitrust suit against the soft­
ware giant.
The agency is taking these 
steps to obtain “prompt, effec­
tive and certain relief for con­
sumers,” it said in a press 
release.
The release follows a judge’s 
order for the two sides to pro­
duce a joint status report by 
September 14.
The government told 
Microsoft that it does not 
intend to pursue a breakup and 
will drop the bundling issue to 
“facilitate consultations” in the 
joint report, the department 
said.
unexpected. At the time of his 
confirmation hearings to be 
Attorney General, John 
Ashcroft hedged when asked 
repeatedly by Senators about 
the government’s commitment 
to pursuing the lawsuit against 
Microsoft.
Ashcroft for the most part 
said that was among a host of 
issues he would need to 
review. On Thursday, his 
department said that since an 
appellate court agreed that 
Microsoft illegally maintained 
a monopoly over the market 
for operating systems, the gov­
ernment “believes it has estab­
lished a basis for relief that 
would end Microsoft’s unlaw­
ful conduct, prevent its recur­
rence and open the operating- 
systems market to competi­
tion.” Pursuing the tying claim 
would only prolong the pro­
ceedings, the department said.

Intel copes with economic downturn
INTEL, from page A1
“It’s not like I had a blowout 
July and blowout August," said 
Andy Bryant, Intel’s Chief 
Financial Officer, in a recent inter­
view with The New York Times. “If 
I had, I'd be sitting here saying 
happy days are here again. What 
we’re saying is that it’s better than 
expected. There’s still risk in here, 
but to tell you the truth, with the 
strength we saw in July and 
August, we’re as comfortable as 
you can be.”
During the same quarter last 
year, Intel reported a profit of $2.9 
billion or $0.41 a share. If revenue 
meets analysts’ expectations, it will 
have declined 26 percent and per- 
share earnings will have fallen 75 
percent.
Daniel T. Niles, a Lehman Bros, 
analyst for The New York Times, 
believes that investors will judge
Intel based upon its ability to meet 
slated expectations and not on 
whether overall sales improve. 
“Things are still getting worse,” 
said Niles.
Intel’s core microprocessor 
business continues to follow sea­
sonal growth patterns and is in 
the midst of ramping up produc­
tion on its Pentium 4 processors 
while at the same time facing eco­
nomic slowdown and a price war 
with rival Advanced Micro 
Devices.
Intel has cut prices on slower 
models as much as 50 percent and 
expects a $90 million loss from 
equity investments, interest, and 
other income. Intel also announced 
its operating costs should be lower 
than expected.
Blue-chip stocks took a dive 
after the Labor Department issued 
a declining employment report for
the month of August with the 
unemployment rate rising to a 
four-year high. The jobless rate 
increased from the 4.5 percent fig­
ure in July to 4.9 percent in August 
- considerably higher than the 
expected 4.6 percent. According to 
Business Weekly Online, analysts 
fear that news of higher unem­
ployment figures may further dis­
courage consumers from spending 
and result in a US economic stum­
ble
In a report by Standard & Poor’s, 
a company that provides financial 
analysis and information, a further 
decline in market growth outside of 
manufacturing is dimming hopes 
for a swift economic recovery. 
European stock markets faltered 
due to weakness in US stocks and 
US Treasuries shot up after the dis­
appointing employment rate 
update.
Business Briefs
Jobless rate 
jumps to six- 
year high
The nation’s unemployment rate 
swelled to 4.9 percent in August as 
job losses in manufacturing passed 
1 million for the yearlong national 
slowdown. The increase in the 
monthly jobless rate was the 
biggest in six years.
The report Friday virtually guar­
anteed further interest rate cuts by 
the Federal Reserve to try to revive 
the economy, analysts said. The 
Federal Reserve has reduced inter­
est rates seven times this year to 
ward off recession. Analysts are 
expecting at least a quarter-point 
cut at the Fed’s Oct. 2 meeting, if 
not a return to the half-point moves 
of earlier in the year.
Businesses slashed 113,000 jobs 
from their payrolls last month, the 
Labor Department reported. The 
jobless rate rose by 0.4 percentage 
point from 4.5 percent in July, the 
level it had held since April.
The unemployment report tends 
to indicate where the economy has 
been rather than where it is going. 
The jobless rate often continues ris­
ing even after the economy starts to 
improve, reflecting the fact that 
businesses are afraid to hire back 
workers until they are certain the 
rebound is sustainable. Economists 
are worried about the report’s 
effect on consumers, whose spend­
ing has kept the economy afloat 
during the sluggish past year.
In August, manufacturing was 
once again hardest hit, shedding 
141,000 jobs, the biggest one- 
month loss so far this year. 
Virtually every major manufactur­
ing industry lost jobs. Since July 
2000, manufacturing employment 
has plummeted by more than 1 mil­
lion. But gains in the service sector
helped offset those losses.
The overall decline of 113,000 
jobs in August followed a revised 
13,000 increase in July. The 4.9 
percent unemployment rate was 
the highest since September 1997 
and marked a pronounced decay 
from the three-decade low of 3.9 
percent posted in several months 
last year.
The 0.4 percentage point 
increase in the overall rate was the 
biggest one-month rise since a sim­
ilar surge in April 1995.
O’Neill sees 
recovery of 
US economy
Some analysts expect the jobless 
rate to rise above 5 percent before 
recovery begins to be felt.
Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill 
joined finance ministers from Asia 
and the Pacific rim on Sunday in an 
upbeat assessment of the global 
economy, predicting a quick US 
recovery and applauding Japan’s 
painful reforms.
O’Neill and other finance chiefs 
of the 21-member Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Forum 
wrapped up a two-day meeting in 
the Chinese city of Suzhou. In a 
closing statement, they expressed 
optimism that the US economy will 
pick up by year’s end, giving a 
needed boost to sagging world 
growth rates.
“Long-term prospects remain 
favorable” in the global economy, 
the statement said.
Europe was the only economic 
power singled out for not doing 
enough to help end the global slow­
down. The ministers scolded the 
European Central Bank for failing 
to cut interest rates as aggressively 
as the US Federal Reserve.
In his comments, O’Neill said he
sees the US growth rate rebound­
ing to 3.2 percent next year. Figures 
last week showed the US economy 
expanded at a sluggish 0.2 percent 
in the April through June quarter.
He brushed aside Friday’s Labor 
Department figures showing 
August unemployment at a four- 
year high of 4.9 percent, saying 
there were already signs that an 
increase in business spending was 
shrinking inventories.
At the conference, O’Neill 
praised China’s high growth rat 
as “really quite wonderful to see.’j 
He also praised the efforts of the 
Japanese leader to end his coun-[ 
try’s decade-long economic slum 
by reining in government spendin 
and forcing banks to write off ba 
loans.AOL eyes

Reviewer doesn’t want to heal from being Cut Once
by Emma Rhem
Copy Co-Ed ¡tor
Local ska album kicks. Yes.
' l ,
Cut Once is a pillar of local ska — so local, in 
fact, that the pictures in the album’s liner notes 
are taken in our very own Gesling Stadium.
Their album, however, has a much more (shall 
we say... ) expansive feel. Polished vocals, 
practiced riffs, and careful arrangements come 
together into a solidly orchestrated chunk o’ 
ska.
I’d like to be all Rolling Stone about this - say 
things like “gritty” and “the shimmering pop of 
ages” - but Cut Once doesn’t really fit any of 
those fun-to-say elitist phrases. Their sound is 
smooth, smooth, smooth and as catchy as 
mono.
For a week and a half, I’ve been listening to 
their newest album Measure Twice about once a 
day, very casually, to sort of let the feel of the 
album creep up on me. (Compare to the new 
Jimmy Eat World album, which I had to listen 
to 4,892,175,839,283 times in three days so I 
could say something intelligent about their 
music!) And I thought, sitting down to write 
this, that I wasn’t sure yet what to say, so I put 
on the album one more time and wait a minute, 
here. I know all the words'. This is what I mean 
by infectious! I keep humming along, without 
realizing that I’ve learned the album forward 
and backward.
The album jumps all around, with no stan­
dard, straight-forward progression of soft to 
hard, or blissful to melancholy. Its shifts in 
focus manage to somehow avoid being distracting or grating. The skips 
and leaps from instrumental to melancholy to bitter to hardworking moti­
vation give the album a bit of the quality of a good mix tape.
My particular favorite on the album is the instrumental fourth track, 
“Bounce Factor 7.” It’s a very ska, almost classic track, and a very comfort­
able, relaxed listen. Satisfying. Yes. The calm gives way to the next track, 
“Take it All Away,” which might just be the highest-energy track on the 
disc. It’s very danceable. I found myself hopping all around in my apart­
ment during the second quarter of the album, and running over to check 
what track number each song was. (This was also pretty directly related to 
the morning’s sugar intake, but even without it, this part of Measure Twice 
causes unconscious toe-tapping.)
The album moves straight into “Hit the Bottle,” a mellow and melan­
choly song, which is fun to sing along with, particularly if you do it in an 
overly dramatic voice with lots of ridiculous affectations. Then we jump 
right back into the high-energy fun of “Straight Ahead” and then move 
again into some slower and more serious songs in the album’s third quar­
ter.
The men of Cut Once pluck my heartstrings (can you believe I actually 
wrote that?) with “Three Rivers.” First of all, breakup songs involving
Film critic declares Hedwig 
and the Angry Itch soothing
MOVIE REVIEW
by Michael Gibbons
Junior Staffwriter
A great musical makes song an 
inseparable part of its storytelling, 
rather than tacking it on as an 
afterthought. Hedwig and the 
Angry Inch is a great musical: the 
meat is in the music while the 
other scenes serve to flesh out the 
material of the songs. A film adap­
tation of the off-Broadway musical 
by the same name, Hedwig and the 
Angry Inch chronicles the misad­
ventures of an outrageous trans­
sexual rock artist (the “angry 
inch” is the result of a botched sex- 
change operation) touring across 
America. Of course, the tour is a 
little off the beaten path, taking 
place in tiny diners with usually 
only a handful of senior citizens as 
an audience, but Hedwig lets loose 
with forceful energy at each and 
every performance
The problem is that Hedwig’s 
ex-boyfriend and protégé, Tommy 
Gnosis (played by Michael Pitt), is 
now a major rock star, while 
Hedwig is still an “internationally 
ignored song stylist”. That’s not 
the worst part: Tommy’s career is 
based entirely on Hedwig’s 
(uncredited) work that she taught 
Tommy when he was a naïve 17 
year-old. Desperate and bitter, 
Hedwig’s travels parallel Tommy’s 
nationwide tour in a manner that 
borders on stalking. Life for 
Hedwig was always less than 
ideal, however, she got the sex- 
change operation to escape from 
East Berlin (only to be divorced by 
her military husband in Kansas) 
and now she’s scraping by with a
band of immigrants, misunder­
stood by seemingly everyone.
John Cameron Mitchell writes, 
directs, and stars in Hedwig, and 
he gives the movie a rich texture of 
alienation through Hedwig’s 
search for identity. Despite her 
ridiculously confident perfor­
mances, Hedwig is deeply insecure 
and troubled by an increasing 
doubt that she’ll ever be happy. 
The movie is concerned with her 
need to come to terms with who 
she is—and what she’s lost. She’s 
the “new Berlin wall”: a divide 
between east and west, man and 
woman.
With a tide like Hedwig and the 
Angry Inch, you expect to see a 
movie that’s crazy in a fun, Rocky 
Horror sort of way. You won’t be 
disappointed. The songs (com­
posed by Stephen Trask) are as 
unpredictable and refreshing as 
Hedwig herself, and at one point 
the audience even gets to sing 
along. It is hard not to be affected 
by Hedwig’s amazing story when it 
is told through such creative conven­
tions of song, animation, flashbacks 
and monologues. Thankfully, 
despite Hedwig’s personal crises, 
the movie does not become lost in 
self-awareness or desperate ploys 
for sympathy— Mitchell’s infec­
tious enthusiasm and heartfelt 
performance is ultimately what 
makes the movie so endearing. 
Even at those few moments when 
Hedwig and the Angry Inch is just a 
little too strange to follow, it’s a 
validating adventure for anyone 
with an open mind
FINAL GRADE: A
rivers are always good and dramatic, and three of ‘em - well that’s even 
better! The lyrics “There may be three rivers running by this town/ But I 
got sorrows nothing’s gonna drown” remind me a little bit of Space 
Ghost’s Musical Barbeque album. (“I’m goin’ down to the river/ Honey 
that’s where I’ll be/ I’m gonna hold my nose and jump right in/ Cause you 
don’t care about me” - one of my personal favorites from the musical 
genius of Space Ghost and company, actually.) The fundamental differ­
ence, however, is that Cut Once is comprised of real people (seven of 
them!) who play real music that’s good, and they’ve got a significantly 
greater message than most cartoons.
Measure Twice is not a bunch of songs about girls. While those are plen­
tiful, they’re not overwhelming. Cut Once has something to say, and that 
is, in a nutshell, that life is full of things that kind of suck, and full of things 
that really rock, so you just better pay attention to it all.
And you should pay attention to Cut Once, the self-proclaimed “ska with 
soul.” Get their mp3s and find out more about them at 
http://cutonce.fromhome.com/ and if you’re cool, go down to Craig Street 
and buy their disc at Brave New World.

Previewer Picks Emmys
SPECIAL PREVIEW
by Adam C. Atkinson
Junior Staffwriter
Well, it’s Emmy time again...ho 
hum. Yeah, right! The Emmy’s are 
a great time to recognize some 
great actors and programs root for 
our personal favorites, so all yinz 
(yes, I’m from Pittsburgh) had best 
tune in!
The Emmys, which air on 
Sunday, Sep. 16th, will be hosted by 
Ellen DeGeneres in yet another 
attempt by the Academy to reach 
out to sexually controversial pro­
gramming.
Last year, with an infusion of 
younger voters, Emmys were hand­
ed out to the crossdressing Eddie 
Izzard, Will & Grace and its cast, 
and If These Walls Could Talk II 
which focused on three lesbian cou­
ples. This year, we’ll see if the trend 
continues. DeGeneres’ stand-up 
special The Beginning was mediocre 
at best, not up to par with her best 
work, but as host she has a good 
shot at winning for her perfor­
mance against the likes of Steve 
Martin, Wayne Brady, Bruce 
Springsteen, and David Letterman. 
I’ll be paying close attention to that.
There is also some controversy 
over the WB receiving zero nomina­
tions, while it received ten last year. 
Even UPN had several nods this 
year, and this has caused some 
speculation. Certainly shows like 
Buffy the Vampire Slayer and 
Gilmore Girls deserve at least some 
recognition, if only for makeup or 
casting.
The focus of this year’s ceremony, 
however, is definitely the show­
down between The West Wing and 
The Sopranos, two of the best pro­
grams in recent history. I thank my 
lucky stars I’m not in the unenvi­
able position of actually voting for 
just one of them. The Sopranos 
racked up a whopping 22 nods, and 
The West Wing was close behind 
with 18. The two shows have devel­
oped a rivalry, and it will be inter­
esting to see whom Emmy favors.
Other interesting tidbits include 
Frankie Muniz being the youngest 
man ever nominated for Leading 
Actor and the addition of a category
for reality programming.
Of course I couldn’t leave you 
without my two cents (more like 
two grand), so I’ve included my pre­
dictions in the major categories. 
Check it out. The red carpet awaits.
Best Lead Actress in a 
Comedy Series: This is a tough 
category. Last season’s leading 
ladies were lackluster at best. 
(Whew! Say that three times fast!) 
The nominees are identical to last 
year’s, except for the return of 
Calista Flockhart after one year’s 
omission, but Ally McBeal and its 
title character are flat, tired (get 
it?) shells of themselves. And no, 
Robert Downey, Jr. can’t save a 
sinking ship with a life preserver. 
Patricia Heaton of Everybody Loves 
Raymond is the defending champ, 
but although she is a fine actress, I 
feel she has gotten way too cruel 
and harsh with her character. 
When I watch her, I get chest pains. 
On the other hand, Jane Kaczmarek 
of Malcolm in the Middle provides 
the perfect blend of a mom both 
frazzled and tender, but she is not 
glamorous enough for the “hip” 
Emmy voters. Sarah Jessica Parker 
of Sex and the City and Debra 
Messing of Will & Grace have their 
moments but are sometimes simply 
too spacy and frustrating to enjoy 
watching.
Who should win: Jane
Kaczmarek
Who will win: Patricia Heaton
Best Lead Actor in a Comedy 
Series: “Uh, oh! Michael J. Fox is 
no longer the easy gift vote! What 
do we do now?” Yes, this woeful 
cry echoed throughout Hollywood 
as voters may actually have to think 
about who gets their vote. Will & 
Grace is very hot, but Eric 
McCormack is often overhadowed 
by the program’smore outgoing 
characters. Ray Romano has done 
little more than whine like a four- 
year-old on Everybody Loves 
Raymond, and I think the whole 
world is ready for Kelsey 
Grammer’s Frasier Crane and John 
Lithgow’s Dick Solomon to grow up 
as well. Ironically, 15-year-old

Doggy Love? Spanish doggy love? Hmm... I recall my first dog, her 
name was Shaggy. She was the most loyal and loving of all canines. She 
epitomized man’s best friend. Tragedy struck though, when a piano 
fell on her. At least she died to an A-major chord, it wasn’t all that bad. 
Poor, poor Shaggy. Soon after, I won a fish at a bazzaar. I named it 
Bitty, and although tiny in size, it filled the gap in my heart left by 
Shaggy. Bitty lived in a tiny bowl for a year and a half. It’s a good thing 
that fish only have two second memories, lest they die of boredom in a 
tank. Anyway, I found Bitty face up on morning, and I flushed her.
I’m not sure if this movie is about doggy love. But I do know that it 
is sponsored by AB, as all Thursday films are. AB had a pretty nice table 
at the activities fair; their inflatable dinosaurs were amusing. The bub­
bles were amusing too, until I spilled them all over my hands. I tried to 
make a big bubble by making a circle with my thumb and index finger, 
but they just slipped away from each other.

Bridget Jones’s Diary
Friday, September 14
Renee Zellweger stars in this undeniable chick flick. Thank God 
I’ll be at the Pittsburgh Symphony that night. I’ve actually heard 
that this movie is pretty good though. It’s too bad she falls for her 
boss, who’s played by Hugh Grant. Why anyone would fall for their 
boss, I do not know. Now, I can see why Hugh Grant fell for 
Elizabeth Hurley. She’s incredibly gorgeous! I wonder if she was 
ever his boss. Maybe in some parallel world, she was a manager at 
a local Disney Storey, and Hugh Grant applied for a job. His desire 
to be part of the Disney Team, and to wear one of those fashionable 
pastel sweaters so impressed Ms. Hurley, that she hired him on the 
spot. They were thrown into a torrid love affair one day, as they 
bumped hands while putting copies of Mulan onto the shelves. Out 
of passion, he took her, and they collapsed over the stuffed Tigger 
display.
Speaking of Tigger, what did he find when he went into the bath­
room? Why, nothing other than Pooh! Excuse the bad joke, my lit­
tle brother told it to me the other day.

My Five Wives
Saturday, September 15
I wonder if this was written, directed, or produced by that polyga­
mist in Utah. Except he has something on the order of 23 wives. Wow, 
22 concubines. I mean, really, why do you need 22? The necessity of 
any more wives than one is questionable, but 22 is a bit drastic. I won­
der how one would keep their names straight, let alone all the kids that 
you’d have. Imgaine buying everyone Christmas presents. You’d have 
to start shopping in May, if you were to put the proper thought into 
each gift. He may think he’s a stud, but he’s just stupid.
Speaking of studs, Rodney Dangerfield is in this movie. Who else to 
lead a lewd comedy but Rod. He’ll have to fight all sorts of temptation, 
because he’s forced to become Amish. Perhaps he’ll take up the crack 
dealing business. Although, if I was in the market for some crack, I 
don’t think I’d go to Rodney for it. He’s the epitome of a dirty old man. 
Lord knows what he’d do to it. He would probably put dandruff and 
cigarette ashes in the baggy. Whether your dealer is Rodney or the fat 
plumber who wears his pants too low, remember that crack kills. Don’t 
do drugs.

Dazed and Confused
Sunday, September 16
Dazed and Confused takes its place among the many stoner flicks that 
has plagued the silver screen and cable for the past thirty years. 
Cheech and Chong is is not. Who would name their kid Chong any­
way? Cheech isn’t much better. Perhaps more appropriately, the duo 
would be Beech and Bong. Peech and Pong would be nice too, 
although that sounds like a cheap ‘80s video game. Leech and Long 
would be amusing. That sounds like a pharmaceutical company 
though. What about Fleech and Flong? Speech and Spong? Zeech and 
Zong? The list can go on and on.
Speaking of duos with unusual names, whatever happend to the 
group Wang Chung? The video for their one famous song was always 
funny, I can still remember Beavis and Butt-head making fun of it. I 
once knew a kid that looked like Butt-head. He talked like him too. It 
was quite unusual to see him banging the bass drum in marching band, 
with his Butt-head head swinging back and forth. He’s a good bowler, 
though.
That’s a sport I was never quite able to grasp. How did it evolve from 
nine-pin? Where did the tenth pin come from? Lavar Burton, of 
Reading Rainbow, once said that thunder is caused by the angels play­
ing nine-pin in heaven. Wait, I think it was in a book that he read. 
Nevertheless, it’s an interesting theory. I wonder if the angels use a 
tenth pin. Will the game ever evolve to 11-pin, or 12-pin? With the 
current arrangement, the most suitable step would obviously be fif­
teen-pin. But that’s a 50% increase in pins. Is that economical for our 
nation’s bowling alleys? Would it increase prices for bowling shoes and 
per game prices? Let’s get our Economics Department on that, I’m sure 
they’ll come up with some interesting figures. Wow, now I’m really 
dazed and confused.

finding (he ways that wmfc
by Debra Halpern
Personnel Manager
Recently my dad has had an 
obsession with singer/songwrit­
ers of his era. Partly because of 
the constant infomercials on TV 
on the “New Singer/Songwriter” 
CD’s, and partly because he 
attended the James Taylor con­
cert this summer. He has posed 
a question to me, which he got 
from VH1. In today’s world 
would singer/songwriters still 
be successful?
First I have to wonder, what is 
a singer/songwriter? Is anyone 
who writes a song and sings a 
singer/songwriter? Of course 
not, because I already have this 
impression that a singer/song­
writer has to sound like James 
Taylor, Bob Dylan, or John 
Denver. In the music consumers 
mind Steven Tyler would never 
be considered a singer/song­
writer.
My dad’s VH1-inspired ques­
tion, also questions if James 
Taylor would be successful now. 
Although I can’t envision a 
campfire experience without 
“Fire and Rain” or a road trip 
without John Denver’s “Country 
Roads,” I must admit that nei­
ther would be successful today.
The music industry has a 
slight problem. It is powered by 
the MTV generation. CD sales 
have dropped and the main con­
sumers of music are teenagers 
and young adults. We can thank 
this to the creation of Hanson 
and the Spice Girls. Not that 
they aren’t enjoyable bands—I 
myself have jammed out to 
“Mmm Bop” and “Wannabe,” 
but they allowed the teen scene 
to debut. The Spice Girls led the 
girl power generation as noted 
by Howard Stern, the recent top 
five on the Billboard charts were 
all girl- and boy bands. While 
some may say Hanson is to 
thank for the boy bands, I must 
disagree; it is quite the opposite.
What boy band would funnel 
out from three pre-teen, 
sketchy-looking boys with long 
blond hair? Hanson instead bust­
ed out with what I would like to 
call the “MTV Version of 
Singer/Songwriters.”
Let me say this: No, Hanson 
does not belong in the 
singer/songwriter category. 
They are a band. They write 
songs, play instruments and 
sing as a group. That is a band. 
They may not be a band every­
one falls in love with, consider­
ing their music is sugar-coated, 
but they are a band. Now 
thanks to the blond boys of 
Hanson, who paved the way for 
young artists, we have a rush of 
young, undeveloped singer/song­
writers. Most recendy and hyped 
up, would be Michelle Branch, 
who, surprise, toured with 
Hanson last year.
Michelle Branch, (a Maverick 
record artist) has become a 
constant on MTV’s TRL with 
her not so much of a hit single 
“Everywhere.” (Let’s face it, 
getting on TRL means you have 
a lot of people emailing the 
show for you, not that you have 
a big audience.) When I 
received Michelle Branch’s CD 
The Spirit Room, I expected a 
lot from the hype. I had heard 
a lot of internet talk on her 
song “Sweet Misery,” but what I 
found was a young, recycled 
topic, which sounded like 
Wilson Philips. I’d like to see 
her reproduce that sound live, 
considering she does all the 
vocals. I don’t believe it to be 
possible. (You could find out if 
you catch the Lifehouse show 
October 15. She will be open­
ing for them.)
But, that’s enough about 
Michelle Branch. It is time to 
move on to the less annoying 
and more developed artists. 
(However, I do feel that 
Michelle Branch does have 
potential to be something in five 
years.) There are other MTV
singer/songwriters out there 
who have gained popularity. 
First, Evan and Jaron, the two 
identical twins who are “Crazy 
For That Girl.” Then there is the 
British band BBMac who want­
ed their baby back, because they 
missed her, and wanted her, and 
needed her so. All of these 
artists’ material is a sad reflec­
tion of the candy-coated music 
world that popular singer/song­
writers have found themselves 
amerced in.
Not to say there are not 
exceptions. We do have our 
saviors out there, who still have 
more creative flare, although 
never as much as Dylan. There 
is always Pete Yorn, who made 
his mark on the Me, Myself& 
Irene soundtrack. And if you 
convince yourself to go up 
north, were beer, hockey, and 
maple syrup is a trademark, 
you will find Canada’s David 
Usher. However David Usher 
needs to be looked at with spec­
ulation. His hit “Alone In the 
Universe” has a Pete Yorn 
sound, but his cover of Tracy 
Chapman’s “Fast Car” sounds 
like a production by the 
Backstreet Boys.
I hate to admit it, but as much 
as I wanted to believe we still 
had great poetic music, I have 
failed. Lyrics are dead. In fact, 
looking at Hanson’s new tune 
“Wake Up” you will hear lyrics 
like “Wake up and smell the 
breeze?” What is that! Dad and 
VH1 are right. Where have all of 
the singer/songwriters gone? (I 
would also like to make a com­
ment about my last article. I do 
not look down upon anyone 
who takes anti-depressants or 
that is in therapy and I did not 
mean to be negative toward 
Brian Wilson on that aspect. 
Also I was mistaken, Brian 
Wilson is not on anti-depres­
sants, but is on anti-anxiety 
medicine. Which is very under­
standable, considering this is a 
mad world.)

21st Annual
EMMYS, from page B7
Frankie Muniz of Malcolm in the Middle seems to be the 
adult of the bunch, with his consistently honest and 
funny Malcolm. However, I doubt the Academy will 
favor him over John Lithgow, whose Third Rock From the 
Sun aired its final episode in the spring. Emmy loves trib­
ute awards.
Who should win: Frankie Muniz
Who will win: John Lithgow
Best Lead Actress in a Drama Series: With sev­
eral mainstays, such as Gillian Anderson and Julianna 
Margulies absent from the list of nominees, this category 
is a fun one. One surprise was Marg Helgenberger of the 
very popular new series CSI: Crime Scene Investigators, 
but she has little chance of pulling off another shocker. 
Sela Ward is the prediction of many, but her show, Once 
& Again, is fading from the limelight, and that can’t help 
her chances. While Amy Brenneman’s aptly titled show, 
Judging Amy, has a loyal following, I don’t know one man 
who watches it. This brings us to the women of The 
Sopranos, Though Lorraine Bracco had a riveting season, 
voters are likely to wonder why she’s not in the support­
ing category. Edie Falco’s ziti-toting mafia mama is 
always fantastic and is a safe bet to win.
Who should win: Lorraine Bracco
Who will win: Edie Falco
Best Lead Actor in a Drama Series: This is one of 
the best categories of the year. Packed with great actors 
in great roles in great shows, I’d be happy if any of them 
won, but Dennis Franz has won his share of trophies. 
Both I and the Academy are ready to move on. Andre 
Braugher was powerful on Gideon’s Crossing, but I’m bet­
ting about half of the voters never saw an episode. James 
Gandolfini had another good year on The Sopranos, but 
his character was static. He didn’t grow as much as he 
could have, and the show, almost sensing this, shifted 
away from him. Rob Lowe has bounced back with The 
West Wing, but what the heck is he doing in the lead actor 
category? God only knows. Even so, Lowe is undoubt­
edly overshadowed by Martin Sheen, who gave the per­
formance of a lifetime in the season finale.
Who should win: Martin Sheen
Who will win: Hey! This rarely happens! Martin 
Sheen!
Best Comedy Series: Last year, the young blood at 
the Academy flexed their voting muscle by naming Will & 
Grace the best comedy. This year, they made their pres­
ence felt by nominating Malcolm in the Middle in place of 
the suddenly unbearable Friends, but this comedy gem is 
probably still too fresh and unique and good to take 
home the big prize. Raymond, despite an excellent cast, 
has been crushed by predictable storylines, and the same 
goes for Frasier and Sex.
Malcolm is the only innovative show in the bunch; it 
has shown that good comedy can be based in something 
besides lewd sexual jokes, but Will & Grace is up to last 
year’s standards, and voters won’t see a reason to change 
gear.
Who should win: Malcolm in the Middle
Who will win: Will & Grace
Best Drama Series: Here it is, the focus of the 
Emmys: The Sopranos vs. The West Wing, the goodfellas 
vs. the good guys, con men vs. congressmen, the black 
hand vs. the White House. Okay, that’s enough. Not 
since Frasier and Seinfeld have there been two high qual­
ity programs that so deliciously battled to be “the best.” 
It’s even tough for me to make a call on this one, and I’m 
a very opinionated person. The Sopranos had arguably 
its most compelling season. The death of Lydia Soprano, 
the rape of Dr. Melfi, Tony’s issues with race, the stuff 
great drama is made of. However, just as Frasier consis­
tently beat out Seinfeld, the cleaner, less controversial 
show will emerge victorious. This is not to say The West 
Wing does not deserve to win. No show has ever so well 
managed to have mass appeal without playing it too safe 
or being cheesy and hackneyed. And the season finale 
happened to be a masterpiece. Oh, yeah. ER, Law and 
Order, and The Practice were nominated too.
Who should win: The Sopranos
Who will win: The West Wing
Those are my picks. I hope I got you all riled up. It’s 
good to have opinions about the arts. (Yes, some TV is 
artistic.) Become informed, and choose for yourself at

rhetoric of prosperity, wages stagnate and inflation 
drives down the quality life of both white collar and 
blue collar workers. Anyone who had read, say,

involved frogs with trumpets 
on lily pads who were being 
buffeted by high winds. Players 
could split a pad up, but each 
split caused a frog to fall.
The person who dumps the last frog wins.
When the schoolchildren finally 
discovered that they'd been

into a bloody proletariat 
revolt, but I was long gone

your weekly sidebar about all things duck related 
Once upon a time in a beautiful land, there 
lived a hideous old princess and her magic pet T
duck, “Free me,” said the duck, “and I will w 
transform you into gorgeous young farmer’s f ) 
daughter. You’ll marry the seventh son of a 
blacksmith and your only son will grow up to M
save the world from a terrible evil!”
The ugly princess rolled her eyes and 
scathingly replied, “And live on a farm? Eww.”
And so the magic duck kept her own counsel from then on. She died, alone 
and dirty, in a sort of cage the princess had commanded to be fashioned for her. 
Someone else had to save the world, too.
Mindful of Emmas fate (for that was the duck’s name), all the other magic 
ducks were careful never to speak in front of a human being again. That is why, 
to this day, ducks quack to each other, for, of course, quacking conveys nothing.

IO September 3001 THE TARTAN
GMO: Girls' tliqht Oof
Dear Girlfriends:
Granted, CMU's population is 60% male and 40% female, so women are in great demand. This places quite a bit of social pressures 
on us, on top of the daily stresses of homework, classes, ex-boyfriends, celibate current boyfriends... So to clear our minds of those 
troublesome boys and catty girls, we suggest ditching your work and going out with your girl troop. There are a lot of things to do in 
Pittsburgh and on campus, whether you want to get hooched up and grind at a club or stay on campus wearing your pajamas in your 
dorm's tv lounge. We've offered up a smattering of options for the range of ways to interpret your Girls' Night Out.
5kib o Coffeehouse - What better pi ace to relax 
and chill with your homegirls than among the yellow 
walls of 5kibo? Grab a smoothie or potato skins and 
dish about your boring professor, or the crisis in the 
Middle East. You can sit at the round tables with 
your roommate, or put a bunch of tables together 
and catch up with your entire troop o’girls. It’s defi­
nitely a good hangout for girl talk on campus. For 
added fun, you can play pool or throw darts in the 
plaid room on the third floor. This room is definitely 
comfortable. And it has vending machines. And 
when you get tired of your girls, you can take a nap
Lewis’ S' The Girls’ Night Out for getting back in 
touch with your feminine side. Are you tired of look­
ing like a bum because you can’t get up more than 
five minutes before class starts? Get away from 
the booksand begirlyfora night. You can paint 
your fingernails, and get your toes done to match. 
Go for that freaky dark purple, or even a bright yel­
low. It’s up to you! Then you can get your hair done 
if you like, in the full salon. Get sprayed, washed, 
cut, and gelled to get a whole new style. You and 
your friends can shut up for once, since your head’s 
gonna be under a drying helmet. So sit back, relax, 
and enjoy the pampering. Lewis’ is on South Aiken in 
Stadvsidfi- it’s nnlv a tft’n minute m\Y
CMU Womens Center - Go learn about being a 
woman, since you ARE one. Diffuse at the Womens 
Center, under the sororities, and check out the 
extensive library of booksand videos. Play the 
piano. Practice for an Open Mic Night. Talk about 
current issues or help plan events with the mem­
bers at the Center. Get involved in something that 
isn’t entirely academic, and that just comletely 
relates to YOU. And again, when you get tired of 
the girls (women!), they’ve got blue couches, too, if 
you want a nap!
Adamson Wing (Baker Hall 136A) - Ok, it’s a bit 
academic, but imagine, you can close the doors, and 
lock all guys out. It’s a pretty comfortable place actu­
ally. The chairs are nice, and the view of Flagstaff Hill 
is one of the best on campus. If you and your girls 
want to chill without any stress, this is the place. 
Grab a coffee and a scone at La Prima and go 
upstairs. Talk about anything, from classes to family 
to guys to the latest havoc-wreaking incident at PHI. 
After all, girls like a brewski now and then, too, and 
football. And belching. And pork rinds. You’ll have to 
bring your own, though, if you want them in Adamson.
