---------------------------------------------------

It was on last Friday that the cruel words were 
spoken for the first time. All the plans for a true gala 
day, such as has been seen here only on the occasion of 
the recent visit of the Founder, were well under way 
The Tartan had bought an extra supply of films, dusted 
the cobwebs but of the of the official camera, made it 
as large as possible, and made other important prepara­
tions to get out the President’s Number in a way to 
become the event of his visit to the Schools. A cover 
design with the American flag in color in the back­
ground, had been selected, and arrangements made to 
run off an extra number of the edition on enameled 
paper, until the awful news came. Our engraver had 
agreed to run the cuts for the edition through in record- 
breaking time so as to have it in the hands of the wait­
ing throngs and gobs of students at the earliest possible 
moment, until we telephoned the death-knell to all our 
special plans.
The President and his immediate party were invited 
to have lunch in the House of the M. M. C. S., and the 
invitation had been accepted by those in charge of the 
Taft arrangements, and it was on this acceptance we 
had suspended our plans. Then on .Friday morning it 
was announced that a certain political aggregation of 
the city desired to make the most of the presence of the 
Chief Magistrate by smollocking all over him. We see 
behind this desire a deep and occult significance which 
we tremble to hint at. Owing to the fact that there is 
considerable of the President to smollock on, these gen­
tlemen would accompany the invited party to the con­
fines of the dining room of the House, to be counted 
as “among those present.” It was on receipt of this in­
formation that the powers held up their hands and said, 
“Nothing doing. We invited the president of United 
States, and will gladly entertain and feed his immedi­
ate party as well, but excuse us from being a free lùnch 
counter for half of the politicians of the city.” And it 
was thus, that we have only a Disappointment Number 
to present.
BULLETIN NOTES.
On the students’ bulletin an interesting picture has 
been posted of two Frenchmen, Henri Lavedau and 
Edmond Rostand, dramatists, both prominent figures 
at the time of Roosevelt’s visit to the French Acad­
emy. The uniforms worn by both men are most in­
teresting.
On the Household Arts bulletin a card announcing 
a lecture and demonstration of Fleichman’s Yeast to 
be held in New York, is posted. It was sent to Miss 
West from Miss Harriet Ellis and Miss Mabel Car~ 
bould, both graduates of the Household Arts depart­
ment, who are making a great success of the task 
they have undertaken.

Where the President was to have taken Luncheon
“The Thistle” in Bud
Will Bloom
The fifth edition of “The Thistle” is, even at our 
early time of going to press, well under way in the 
hands of the Pittsburgh Printing Co. The editors 
have made up the last “dummy”, read the last proof, 
placed the last cut, and now the binding and print­
ing is all under way for a delivery of books Friday 
night. These are for the night Applied Science 
School, and will be delivered to them only. The 
balance of the edition is to be in the store-room in 
the A. & J. building on Monday for all day classes.. 
Since the Night Science School closes on the evening 
of May 6, this arrangement has been decided upon, 
for all of the books cannot be delivered at that time.
The book is slightly smaller in its dimentions than 
that of last year, and has the contents in a more 
condensed form; in all over thirty pages had to be 
omitted for the sake of compactness. The volume is 
dedicated to the memory of Mr. Carnegie’s mother, 
Mrs. Margaret Morrison Carnegie, and contains a 
photogravure of her that was borrowed from one of 
her relatives for reproduction. A two page letter from 
the Founder is reproduced in fac-smile.
Enough extra copies have been ordered to supply 
the demands of practically of all those who did not 
subscribe for it in advance and will be sold for the 
regular price of $1.50.
Friday Night
Some startling figures that tell their own tale and 
gleaned from the results of the subscription gather­
ers as may be seen from the following percentages. 
The basis of these is the actual number of students 
recorded in the new catalog, which is slightly in ex­
cess of the present number. These percentages in 
dicate the number of subscriptions received in com­
parison to the enrollment:
Applied Science—Day 55.5%, Night 16.8%—
31.9%.
Applied Design—Day 47.0%, Night 2.13%—
25.2%.
A. and J — Day, 21.1%, Night 2.8% — 
9.7%.
M. M. C. S.—Day 33.8%, Night 7.5%—
20.7%.
Average of entire Schools, 21.2%,
Statistics compiled by the officers of the senior 
class at Princeton show that the average expense of 
a college student at that place for four years of his 
course is $3,675, or about $919 a year. The minimum 
four years’ expenditure reported is $800, and the 
maximum $10,000.

_ HE TARTANL
“MISS MISTAKEN” TO BE GIVEN ON MAY 28.
The Annual White Friar Show to be Held in the 
Alvin Theatre.
Set this date down in your memory book and re­
member it—May 28th—White Friars at the Alviin. 
You want to be sure and be there and see the White 
Eriaris do tlhjedr annual stunt and, incidentally, see 
lihje best ailll airound college show that has been in 
Pittsburgh thiiis winter.
There have beiein many stories going about comcr n- 
ing tdie quality of the show this year. It ¡has been 
saiid that lit was not iup to the standard of the past 
shows, and .tftnait lit was going to be a black mark on 
the spiritless record of tlhe Club. With these things 
in imiinid 'the writer went ovier to the rehearsals held 
the past week and spent the time sizing things up. 
One thing is absoliuteliy certain, the show as going 
to raise the standard set by last year's banner pro­
duction. This lis not said off-hand, 'buit after much 
careful thought upcm the subject. The chorus is 
larger, dances better, and shapes up better in every 
way. It ha:s a swing and dairih to ‘it that while not 
lackirig in last year’s chorus, was not nearly so 
marked. The singing chorus, working under Mr. 
Dcirriimgton, is aliso considerably increased over last 
year’s and have much better trained and blended 
voices. The cast, who have finished .the first act, is 
a weill balanced, smooth working piece of machinery. 
Add to ¡this total la better and funnier book and a 
very much better selection of music, amid you can 
easily see that all of the stories that have been 
passed are 'utterly (false and without ground to stand 
on. If you are the kind that come from a certain 
Western State anid prefer 'to see for yourself, just 
go to a rehearsal some night. You will see enough 
to make siure of this fact, that the show is not going 
to be as rumor woulld have St.
Mr. Edmundson is very much elated with the 
manner .in which the show is progressing. He said 
to me, when I asked him about the ruimors, “Just 
took anid see for yourself. Yon know what the 
Friars have dome in the past. You have seen the 
relheatnslalls. Did they look as tgood as this? I guess 
not. This year’s bunch is the best, the most hard 
working crowd of hoys that I have ever had to work 
with, and with siuch a combination do you think 
that we are going backward? You just drop around 
on the 28th of May and see yourseilf.”
The costumes aré being made and will sloon be 
ready. It is my hope that I can get some pictures 
ready for publication next week, but I don’t know 
whether that will be possible or not. Manager 
Mitchell says (that he will do all he can to aid me, 
and, if possible, Will at least get some of ¡the cos­
tumes ready.
The subscription cards will be ready and out this 
week. It tis the intention, I believe, to have a man 
in each section handle these cards. By purchasing 
thorn you can secure your seats one day in advance 
of the public sale on May 24t'h. Any party or fra­
ternity desiring boxes are requested to see the man­
ager as soon as possible. A. A. B.
TECH LOSES TO PITTSBURGH.
Tech lest her game last Saturday by the terrible 
¦score of 15 to 1, Pittsburgh College being the win­
ners. Tihie game was played cm the Pittsburgh Col­
lege Cam,pus on the bluff.
The playing was very ragged al.ll around, 11 errors 
'being' .made. Of this grand totall Tech made 8, a 
truly wonderful showing. It is unfortunate that the 
errors could not win for us. Tech a too used three 
ipitchers, who were touched up far a total of 12 hits. 
The game abounded tin stolen bases. Gerhart stole 
the only one for Tech, while there was a total of 
mine stolen by the Pittsburgh collegians.
The feature of the game was the pitching of 
Burke, who allowed only lour hits. The score:

EDITORIAL
“THE THISTLE” AND THE DEAD ONES.
On another page will be found the detailed list of 
the percentage of students of the Schools who had 
sufficient interest in affairs to turn in subscriptions 
to the only book devoted to the interests of them­
selves that is issued during the year. We are glad 
to have these figures as an actual and itemized rec­
ord of the spirit existing among the several Schools. 
It is an interesting list for more than one reason.. We 
notice that there has always been a larger sized com­
plaint from those schools having the smallest figures 
after them, concerning their representation in stu­
dent activities and what they get out of them. The 
girls are no exception. The table very plainly shows 
where the brunt of the burden of conducting our stu­
dent enterprises always falls, for it is invariable in 
the same place. It gives us a fine idea of just what 
results to expect when any other affair of common 
interest is under consideration. We can see where 
the work and the wherewith come from and by mak­
ing an inverse application, predict accurately who 
will raise the old cry, “We weren’t represented in 
that. We don’t get a square deal. The day students 
and the Science men run everything. What is the 
use of our paying for something we don’t get the 
preference in,” etc., to infinity squared.
If it were not for the golden rule, we might advo­
cate treatment of Schools in direct proportion to the 
interest they show in student affairs. It is rather dis­
couraging.
FUTURE NUMBERS.
There will be a number devoted to the interests of 
the White Friars on May 18. It will contain pic­
tures of members of the cast and chorus in the cos­
tumes for this year’s production, and much matter 
of interest.
We now announce a Silly Number to appear in the 
near future.
BILL FOR NATIONAL FINE ARTS COMMISSION.
Before the bill which the House has passed for a 
National Commission of Fine Arts becomes a law, if 
it does become one, it may of course be much chang­
ed. But that this bill should have originated in the 
House, and have been passed by it, distinguishes it 
from many bills of a generaly like purpose that have 
gone before, and puts into the hearts of the meas­
ure’s friends an exceeding hopefulness. The bill as 
passed by the House authorizes the appointment by 
the President of a permanent Commission of the Fine 
Arts, to be composed of seven artists of repute, who 
shall serve without compensation for four years. It 
shall advise in the selection of models for statues and 
monuments to be erected under the authority of the 
United States, regarding the atrists to execute these 
works, and upon any question of art upon which the 
President or any committee of either house shall ask 
its judgment. Further, it shall determine the loca­
tion of statutes and monuments in the streets and 
public squares of the District of Columbia. For the 
expenses of the Commission, an annual appropriation 
of $6,000 is allowed. Neither President nor Congress 
is bound to act in accordance with the advice the 
Commission gives. This would seem to be a very 
mild and gentle bill—the simplest sort of a beginning, 
but no one who has followed the fate of previous 
measures of the sort, or who heard the debate upon 
this bill, can overlook the significance of its being a 
beginning and of its having passed the House. It 
should perhaps be noted that Mr. McCall, who as 
chairman of the Library Committee presented the 
bill, received some of his best support fom the 
speeches of a congressman from Texas and of a con­
gressman from Wisconsin. These men spoke with 
great earnestness in the bill’s behalf. And that is a 
reminder that in the upper house, quite incongru­
ously as one might think, the senator from raw Ne­
vada has long been recognized as the main depend­
ence for legislation of this kind. —The Architectural
Record.

Washington will hereafter be granted the honorary

THE TARTAN7
FRESHMEN BASEBALL.
. . In a rather strennous contest on Tech Field, the 
Freshman team defeated Pittsburgh College Re­
serves 4-3.
The errors of the visitors, although decidedly 
numerous, were of but slight advantage to the Fresh­
men in run getting. Rogers, for the Reserves, was in 
good form, not passing a man.
In the ninth inning the hopes of the Reserves ran 
high, when with one man out they scored one run 
and filled the bases by drawing 2 passes, making a 
hit, and a third pass. Baird, however, steaded down 
and by an 'assist to Duff and a strikeout, retired the 
side. Score:

; NOTES.
The Freshmen team desires to express its thanks to 
those attending Saturday’s game, for the encourage­
ment their presence and cheering gave. Were the root­
ing at the Varsity base-ball games in the same propor­
tion as the crowd of students attending, there would be 
a semblance, at least, of the inspiring cheering done last 
fall at the foot-ball games—when Tech was winning.
The Freshmen team is scheduled to meet the strong 
Braddock aggregation on Tech Field next Saturday,
May 7th, at 10.30 A. M. The game is to be played in 
the morning on account of East Liberty Academy, and 
the. Varsity using grounds in the afternoon.
v 1
The Freshmen have developed a showing of team 
work and are out in arms to avenge their misfortune at 
Braddock in the first game of the season, so an interest­
ing struggle is anticipated.
The remaining four games of the Plebes’ schedule are 
to be played away from home, so this will be;-the clast 
opportunity of seeing the .team in action. It would be 
quite gratifying to have a good attendance at the game.
GLEE CLUB AT DUQUESNE.
The combined Glee and Mandolin Clubs gave a con­
cert in the Carnegie Music Hall of Duquesne, Pa., last 
Mondy evening to a very good and appreciative house. 
The affair was in the form of a benefit under the aus­
pices of the Ladies’ Aid Society, of the St. Alban’s 
Episcopal Mission. Twelve numbers were on the pro­
gram, and encores were frequent. Warrilow made the 
hit of the evening in his comic recitations and songs, 
and the rest of the clubs performed in a creditable 
manner.
BRITISH SCHOOLBOY “HOWLERS.”

Founder’s Day was to have been a red-letter day in 
this school, but owing to a change in plans, the fac­
ulty and students have been thrown i nthe depths 
of despair. President Taft was scheduled to take 
luncheon in our building, thus honoring the school 
forever, but somehow he was enticed into a party at 
the University Club on Founder’s Day. The girls 
were much disappointed and will be pacified only on 
the promise of a visit from some other honored per­
sonage—possibly no less a person than Theodore 
Roosevelt.
On Thursday evening of last week the Senior class 
of the Night School held an informal dance in the 
Faculty rooms in this school, which all the Faculty 
agreed was the prettiest affair ever given in this 
school. The mantles and chandeliers were covered 
with greens, and the supper tables were charming 
with candles and flowers. Director and Mrs. Hamer- 
schlag were both present, the Director expressing 
himself delighted with the affair.
.Miss Mary McKee, a graduate of this school, now 
a teacher of Domestic Science, has planned to bring 
her pupils to visit her Alma Mater this week. Miss 
McKee’s students are as anxious to see how the Do­
mestic Science course is carried on here as the 
Household Arts girls are to see the progress made 
by a graduate of their department.
The Household Arts girls are in a dilemma over an 
appropriate gift to be presented to the “House” on 
their departure from the school. A custom has been 
established that each successive class graduating 
from this department, shall present the “House” with 
a token of their love for it. Last year the gift was 
our school motto beautifully engraved and framed, 
to be hung in the hall-way of the apartment. But 
this year the girls are wrangling over the suitability 
of a sewing machine, a vacuum cleaner, or a coffee 
urn. Let us hope they come to a decision before 
Class Day.
At Nebraska, professors who do not dismiss their 
classes on time are listed in the school paper.
Two Missouri track athletes training on the streets 
in athletic garb recently caused a team of mules to 
run away. The citizens of Columbia, Missouri, then 
rose in their wrath and put a stop to long distance 
sprinting on public thoroughfares.
