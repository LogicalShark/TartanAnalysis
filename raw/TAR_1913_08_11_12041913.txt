HOUSE MAKES ADDRESS
INTERESTING TALK GIVEN BY 
MR. COOPER ON WEDNES­
DAY, NOVEMBER 26TH.
Mr. Cooper’s talk was made up, to 
a large extent, of anecdotes and 
stories gathered from personal ex­
perience with the type of people that 
the Kingsley House reaches. These 
stories, some amusing and some 
pathetic illustrated the ideals, the 
efforts and some of the results of the 
social settlement work.
He gave a short history of the so­
cial settlement work and its develop­
ment. In England about fifty years 
ago it was found that the ideals set 
by the universities and other educa­
tional institutions were not permeat­
ing to all classes and so a settlement 
house was founded.
The settlement house is a place 
where men and women of culture live 
among other people to give them a 
higher ideal of life. The fundamental 
principle of the whole thing is per­
sonal contact. The old saying is that 
half the world does not know how the 
other half lives, but the curiosity of 
the other half as to how the upper 
half lives is a line of interest which 
is followed up in settlement work.
Gen. Booth said that the first step 
in helping a poor outcast is letting 
him know that someone else has an 
interest in his rise or fall.
Mr. Cooper closed his talk with 
a plea that every man take it upon 
himself to help raise the ideals of 
life. He said, “Higher standards are 
necessary, and it is the privilege of 
educated men and women to estab­
lish them. It is a problem that you 
Tech men will have to tackle and 
solve. I don’t know where you men 
are going to be, but wherever you 
are you should help raise the stand­
ard of living in your city.
That spirit of willingness to go out 
and do something for the betterment 
of your neighbor is, I believe, the 
true spirit of democracy.”

Reflections of a Youth 
on His 78th Birthday
Let us all trust the President.
The Government right or wrong 
and the President right or wrong 
is a bad policy.
I am 79 years old, but have no 
speaking acquaintance with age.
Christmas giving has become a 
great and heavy task. A card of 
greeting in one’s handwriting is 
the best present.
The whole range of public enter­
tainment appears to be sinking to 
the lowest level.
Bobbie Burns is the best loved 
Scotchman.
President Wilson has made a re­
markable triumph, but it is difficult 
for him to explain why he assumed 
to interfere in the domestic quar­
rels of another nation.—New York 
World.
“Uncle John” Brashear left here on 
November 20th for Oakland, Cal., to 
keep a promise made 24 years ago to 
his friend, Dr. Charles Burckhalter, 
director of the Chabot Observatory. 
In 1889, Dr. Brashear, while a guest 
at a birthday party given by Dr. 
Burckhalter, promised that, if alive, 
he would eat his 73rd birthday dinner 
with Dr. Burckhalter.
More than 2,000 citizens of Pitts­
burgh and representatives of the local 
institutions of learning joined with 
the faculty and students of the Car­
negie Institute of Technology in the 
observance of Carnegie Day in the 
Carnegie Music Hafl, the occasion 
being the seventy-eighth birthday of 
the founder of the institution.
The address was delivered by 
Charles M. Schwab, president of the 
Bethlehem Steel Company and a for­
mer member of the committee on the 
institute of technology. William Mc- 
Conway, of the board of trustees, was 
the recipient of the first honorary de­
gree conferred by Tech, that of doctor 
of engineering.
Preceding the gathering in the mu­
sic hall there was a parade of all the 
day students of Margaret Morrison 
School for Girls and of the men’s 
school, those from the department of 
music making their first public appear­
ance.
There was not a vacant seat in the 
music hall when the exercises com­
menced. On the stage Director A. A. 
Hamerschlag, in the robes of a doctor 
of science, sat on one side, and Wil • 
liam McConway on the other side of 
the speaker of the day, Mr. Schwab 
Back of them were Miss Mary F. 
Breed, new dean of Margaret Morri­
son Carnegie School for Women; 
Dean C. B. Connelley, of the School 
of Applied Industries; Dean J. H.

cuit court; William P. Field, secretary 
of the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology, and Mrs. Harry Hart, former­
ly Miss Anna B. Smith, first dean of 
Margaret Morrison School for 
Women.
Mr. Schwab was introduced by Di­
rector Hamerschlag, after a selection 
by the class in music. He said, in 
part:
“On this occasion I need neither 
preparation nor inspiration to say the 
few simple words of admiration, love 
and affection for my great friend and 
your great friend, and mankind’s great 
friend—Andrew Carnegie—out of the 
simple desire to talk about the man 
that I love most of all men.
“I met Mr. Carnegie first as a boy 
and I loved, admired and looked up 
to him then. There has not been a 
year of my life since I met him, 
through youth, through middle age, 
and now on the shady part of life that 
him from the beginning.
“The one great thing of Mr. Car­
negie was that wonderful personality 
that enabled him to inspire men of 
even ordinary accomplishments to un­
usual efforts. I have known many 
men in business and professional life, 
but I have never known any man who 
possessed in the remarkable degree this 
accomplishment that Mr. Carnegie 
does. Mr. Carnegie’s associates in 
business are generally thought of as 
being a remarkably brilliant and 
talented lot of men. That was not 
so in itself. They were brilliant in 
their accomplishment, but they were 
brilliant because of the inspiration and 
the leader and the broad-minded pol­
icy of the man who directed.”
At the conclusion of Mr. Schwab’s 
address Cheer Leader Savage took a 
position on the stage and the “yell” 
by the students was concluded with 
“Schwab” thrice repeated.
Then followed the reading of the 
telegram, dated November 24, the 
birthday anniversary of the sender, 
my admiration, love for and knowl­
edge of him have not increased that 
love and respect which we had for 
in San Francisco, telling of his good 
wishes for the men being honored 
and the institution and concluding 
with “God bless you all.” It was signed 
“Uncle John.” But everybody knew 
it was Dr. Brashear and his message

The cross-country team added an­
other trophy to the collection when 
they captured the team prize in the 
run held under the auspices of the 
Crafton A. A. on Thanksgiving Day. 
Capt. Haselton set the pace for the 
greater part of the six miles and was 
beaten by a narrow margin in the 
last quarter-mile, by Organ, of the 
Sharon A. C. Every one of the ten 
Carnegie Tech runners that started 
finished and four succeeded in plac­
ing so that the team cup was award­
ed to the wearers of the Plaid.
Considering the weather conditions 
of the day and the slippery roads 
which the course followed, the times 
made by the winners were remark­
able. Haselton led the forty entrants 
from the start and drew away from 
all but a few in the first mile. With 
Organ close on his heels, he rapidly 
increased his lead although running 
easily.
Over the hills and down the valleys, 
he reeled off the miles with clock-like 
regularity, but was unable to shake 
off his adversary. When they reached 
the half-mile track and started on the 
last mile, which was to be run on 
the oval speed-way, Haselton was 
still in the lead. But Organ started 
his final sprint on the last lap and 
the Tech captain, having had the 
strain of setting the pace, could not 
head him once the other had taken 
the lead.
Organ’s time for the six miles was 
31 minutes and 3 seconds, while Hasel­
ton was but 14 seconds behind him.
MacMillan ran a good race and 
finished third, ahead of Grumbling 
and Levine, of Pitt. State and W. & 
J. were also represented in the race 
but the Tech runners made the best 
showing as a team. Thirty-two of the 
forty starters crossed the finish line, 
and all of the Plaid were in the first 
twenty-five.
After the first four, the crowd was 
pretty well bunched, and there were 
some close races on the home stretch 
for places. Campbell and Handleman, 
finishing eleventh and twelfth, re­
spectively, cinched the trophy for 
Carnegie, beating out Henning of 
State and Gantas of Pitt. Elder of W.
& J., the first of the Red and Black 
runners, finished behind Dunseith. 
Reeder, Westinghouse’s best distance 
man, was eighteenth with Brunot 
ahead of him.

PITTSBURGH, PA., DEC. 4, 1913 
FOOTBALL.
We have heard a great deal of 
criticism recently around the school 
about the football team. This is 
summed up by a demand for “either 
a good football team next year or none 
at all.” We do not wish to join in 
this criticism. In many ways we be­
lieve that this year’s team has done 
good work, and we do not like knock­
ers. Nevertheless, like all the rest of 
the students and faculty we should 
like to see next year a team which 
could represent Carnegie in football 
and compete with the other large col 
leges in such a manner as to attain 
in athletics that high place which we 
already hold in educational lines. Fail­
ing that, we do not see any particular 
harm in getting along without any 
football team. It might then be pos­
sible to devote all our energies 
towards excelling in other athletic 
activities, such as track, basketball 
and baseball. This method has been 
tried successfully in other technical 
schools in the country, and it might 
be a good thing here.
ATHLETICS.
The preceding discussion brings up 
the question as to the merits of the 
entire American system of athletics, 
which allows its advantages to be 
gained by only a few, while the many 
who cannot participate get no good at 
all from athletics. Let us quote from 
a speech of Dr. James Chapman, 
President of the Southland Training
College of London. While in Amer­
ica, in speaking of athletics, he said: 
“I have no patience with your Ameri­
can athletics. You are all wrong. 
You are debasing the bodies and 
morals of your students by training a 
few for these great gladiatorial shows, 
while the great mass of students sim­
ply look on and applaud. I have vis­
ited America three times, and find 
that you have many things to teach 
us, but we have much to teach you 
about athletics. In England, the aim 
is to develop every boy into full pos­
session of all his physical powers, and 
not to overtrain a few for the enter­
tainment and amusement of crowds. 
Public opinion in England forces ev­
ery boy in our schools to engage in 
some form of healthful sport or to 
receive the humiliating appelation of 
‘dub.’ ”
How much better this is than the 
American idea! This athletic prob­
lem is a vexing one, which should be 
solved as quickly as possible, and the 
school which first solves it will de­
serve a great deal of credit. We 
should like to see Carnegie the first 
institution in this country to adopt 
the English method, Of course, it 
will take a great deal of time and 
thought to work out a successful 
scheme, but the advantages to be de­
rived for the entire student body 
would seem to outweigh all the 
trouble necessary to install the sys­
tem.
ADVERTISING.
We hear the statement so often 
that one of the best ways to advertise 
a school is through its athletic teams. 
Leaving aside the question as to the 
truth of this statement, and only con­
sidering whether anv advertisement at 
all should be necessary, it will be 
admitted by all that many colleges 
in this country, in their struggle for 
existence, seek to attract larger num­
bers of students by various dubious 
means, and the smaller the school the 
greater seems to be its dependence 
upon athletics.
In the last annual report of the 
Carnegie Foundation, President 
Pritchett truly says that competitive 
advertising should have no place in 
education, and the only advertising 
which has a place at all is that which 
is ‘informational and thoroughly hon­
est.” Take for example the case of 
a small college which claims to have 
‘‘the oldest, best and highest stand­
ards in the West, with a high-toned
...............noble faculty.” This kind of
advertising is certainly not ethically 
justifiable, and adds nothing to the 
educational standard of American 
colleges. According to President 
Pritchett there is a definite place for 
a certain kind of advertising. Thus, 
honest unexaggerated statements of 
the equipment, curriculum, and meth­
ods of instruction of a school cannot 
do harm, and are really of advantage 
when one is seeking accurate informa­
tion as to the character of a school. 
But in his opinion, great harm is done 
when a college seeks to attract large 
numbers of students by questionable
statements as to its facilities for in­
struction. In President Pritchett’s 
words, “whatever may have been true 
thirty years ago, it is clear that today 
we need not more colleges, but fewer 
colleges, not more students, but bet­
ter prepared students, and that the 
opportunity both of the college and 
university to contribute to national 
progress lies not in bigness, but in 
greater simplicity, sincerity, and thor­
oughness; not in advertising, but in 
modern performance. Advertising in 
education is not so much a disease 
as a symptom.”
The following is the letter to the 
Science men from the family of Dean 
Hewlett:
68 Remsen Street,
Brooklyn.
Mrs. Hewlett desires to express to 
the students of the Science School 
her gratitude for their sympathy, and 
for the tribute paid to her son. That 
he lives in their memory is a solace 
to her in her own loss and she re­
joices to feel their appreciation of his 
work among them.

MR. T. W. ALEXANDER, JR., 
MR. W. E. BOAK,
MR. P. B. HARWOOD.
Eight distinct building projects are 
going on at Harvard, involving a cost 
of more than four million dollars. Not 
since the medical school was finished 
in 1906 has there been such an addi­
tion to the university. The most im­
portant of the new buildings is the 
new Widener Library in the college 
yard, on which two million dollars 
are being spent. The remainder goes 
to Freshman dormitories, the stadium 
bridge, laboratories, and museum ex­
tension.
It is now definitely assured that 
the oratorial contest of the Prohibi­
tion League of Pennsylvania will be 
held at State College this year. Rep­
resentatives of about ten colleges in 
the State will participate and will 
contest for the $60 in prize money 
which is offered.
Sir Courtenay Ilbert, G. C. B., clerk 
of the House of Commons of the 
British Parliament has delivered the 
J. S. Carpentier lectures before the 
schools of law and political science of 
Columbia University. The subject of 
the course is “The Mechanics of Law- 
Making,” and the sub-titles of the 
talks, “Duties of a Parliamentary 
Counsel,” “Rules for the Guidance of 
Draftsmen,” “Forms of Legislation,” 
“Codification,” and “Some Character­
istics of Modern Legislation.”
Two hundred and sixty men regis­
tered for the Musical Clubs of the 
University of Pennsylvania. Of this 
number eighty-five reported for the 
Mandolin Club and one hundred and 
seventy-five for the Glee Club.
Sixty-five men reported to Coach 
Nickolls for the first workout on the 
river at Penn.

A MEMORY OF
DEAN HEWLETT
My first interview with the Dean 
lasted but a few moments. I came as 
a stranger to apply for entrance and 
while I was talking to the secretary 
the door opened and the Dean came 
forward and introduced himself. In 
a few words he found out what I 
wanted and sent me to the professor 
in charge of that department, but the 
impression that he made upon me was 
very lasting.
The charming simplicity of his bear­
ing, his kindly smile, that warm light 
in his eyes drew me to the man and 
my heart was captured. I could feel 
the delicacy of his nature. There was 
a friendly heart always open for every 
stranger. Those eyes must always 
smile and that warm little fire from 
his great heart was never out.
A few days later I had a more inti­
mate talk with the Dean. And, oh! 
what a man I found him. Such a rare 
sympathy and delicacy! Sensitive and 
fine, but such a great heart! I felt 
that I could never forget this man.
I loved to watch him meeting the 
hundreds of students and visitors 
who came to his office. Under the 
pressure of his work, tired and busy, 
with a slight frown upon his brow, 
and yet the unfailing kindly smile as 
he went from one to the other. Al­
ways warmth and encouragement for 
all who came to him.
Often from my window I have 
watched him, late in the evening, as 
he walked home, a tired, thinking face, 
how clearly it bore the stamp of 
spiritual aristocracy!
I loved best to watch him in the 
Carnegie Music Hall on Saturday 
evenings. I could see the soul of the 
artist in his eyes. How he would re­
spond to the waves of the organ, how 
his changing face would reflect the 
theme of the music!
Once at a violin recital he sat in 
front of me. His bent head and quiv­
ering shoulders told me that the 
drama of the music surged in his 
heart. When the violinist had finished 
Dean Hewlett turned his face toward 
me—it was illumined with a beautiful 
spiritual light, the eyes shone with 
heavenly fire—“Good,” was all he said 
but his voice vibrated with rapture.
I knew him for a very short time 
but the benediction of his influence 
fell upon me and the greatness of 
his nature left its impress upon my 
heart.
He is not wholly departed from our 
midst. Every memory of him bids us 
to toil with the same eagerness and 
zeal, and with the same high purpose 
that he held among us.

Plans for the new charter system 
for student organization which was 
authorized by the Barnard College 
faculty last spring, have been recently 
worked out by the student council 
and approved by the faculty commit­
tee on student organizations and the 
undergraduate association. The sys­
tem, as adopted, provides that no or­
ganization may exist unless chartered 
by student council, with the approval 
of the faculty committee. Charters 
may be granted for one, two, or three 
years, and may be renewed by vote 
of the council.
In applying for charters each group 
of students must submit a statement 
of the purpose of the proposed organi­
zation, the requirements for mem­
bership, the amount of dues, and the 
number of meetings desired; changes 
in regard to any of these matters 
must be submitted to the council at 
intervals, and constitutions and lists 
of officers must be filed with the sec­
retary. The council has the right to 
make recommendations to any organ­
ization.
If the organization refuses to ac­
cept the recommendation and student 
council, after considering the reasons 
for this refusal, holds to its former 
decision, the question is to be referred 
to the faculty committee, whose de­
cision shall be final. It is understood 
that for the next three 3rears such 
fraternity chapters as desire to retain 
their present organization—without 
the right to elect new members—shall 
be required to file with student coun­
cil as much of the information usually 
demanded as their national organiza­
tions will permit.
Grinnel and the Hawkeyes are 
scheduled to mix- in the first college 
game of soccer played in the Central 
States. The game will take place on 
November 15.
Illinois and Michigan Universities 
have already started a series of chess 
matches. The Western intercollegiate 
chess association plans to conduct a 
number of these matches this year.
Recently, at Drake University, a 
canine of the Collie extraction belong­
ing to one of the students was buried 
with due ceremony in Andrews pri­
vate cemetery. Six university students 
acted as mourners.
The University of Pennsylvania 
has three new coaches this year.
For the first time in forty-three 
years the faculty and students of the 
University of Michigan met as one 
huge family last Friday afternoon 
when a convocation was held. 5500 
students and faculty attended the cere­
monies filling the Hill auditorium to 
its full capacity.
Three sophomores have been ex­
pelled and one suspended for a year 
for hazing freshmen at Illinois.
Psychological tests of mentality are 
to be applied to all members of the 
present freshman class at Dart­
mouth.
The Cornell Daily Sun is optimis­
tic because the number of arrests of

six having been arrested so far.

HOLIDAY TEA AT 
THE DORMITORY.
The M. M. C. S. Dormitory enter­
tained their friends at a delightful 
tea on Sunday, November thirtieth, 
from three until five o’clock. Several 
members of the Glee Club were pres­
ent and sang some of the popular 
music of the day. The Girls of the 
Dormitory were ably assisted by Mr. 
William M. Sheldon.
Miss Parry entertained the out of 
town M. M. C. S. students from three 
to five on Saturday. November twen-

and enjoyed a very pleasant after­
noon.
SENIOR GIRLS HONOR MISS 
LYON.
The Senior Household Economics 
Class of the M. M. C. S. gave a 
party in honor of Miss Lyon, the head 
of their department on Wednesday 
afternoon, November twenty-sixth, 
in the “Little House.”
A novel entertainment was where 
each one attending the party went 
representing some book. Then the 
others were to discover what books 
were represented. Some very clever 
ideals in disguising names were 
brought out. Other games were 
played and everyone enjoyed an ex­
tremely pleasant afternoon. Refresh­
ments were served, including a birth­
day cake made by the girls of the de­
partment.
A SALARY RAISE.
‘‘Good morning, Mr. Perkins,” greet­
ed Forbes, airily.
Perkins glared, speechless.
“Good morning. Mr. Perkins,” 
repeated the young salesman politely. 
Perkins exploded.
“What th’ dickens d’yuh mean by 
butting in on me!” he roared.
“Quite so. Quite so,” agreed the 
young man. “Now to our business—” 
“I won’t listen! Beat it—quick!” 
“What I wished to see you about 
was—”
“But I—”
“Well, what is it? Quick!”
“I am now drawing sixty dollars 
per month,” said Forbes easily. “I 
wish it increased to eighty, com­
mencing—”
“And for that you come rampaging 
in here at my busiest hour. Boy, are 
you plumb crazy?”
“Don’t get excited, sir. Eighty dol­
lars is a trifling sum—”
“Trifling sum? Good Lord! Why 
when I was your age, eighty dollars 
was a huge amount—”
“But times have changed, Mr. Per­
kins. When you were my age times 
were different.”
Education, and morals were lower. 
Neither pure food nor Teddy Roose­
velt had come into use. More time
and liquor were consumed, fewer 
books read. With all due respect I 
venture to suggest that modern sal­
aries are not to be regulated by what 
they once were.”
“Say—Say—” spluttered the irate 
employer: “I know you’re going to
be disappointed. D’yuh know you’re 
the first one of my men who’s dared 
to ask me f’r a raise? Can’t I run 
my own business? Don’t I know w’en 
a man deserves a raise without him 
cornin’ in here when I’m up to my ears 
in work?”
“So I suspected,” returned Forbes. 
“However, I’m not trying to run your 
business. My matter is personal to 
me—”
“You—you—”
“Don’t say it please,” admonished 
the younger man. “You might regret 
it.”
“Well, of all the—”
“Nerve,” completed Forbes. “Yes, 
it’s nerve, Mr. Perkins; I admit that, 
but success requires nerve these 
days.”
Perkin’s stern feature relaxed a 
trifle and he indulged in the ghost of 
'a smile.
“Mebbe you’re right,” he hazarded. 
“At any rate, you've plenty of the 
right stuff in you, if you are fresh. 
You need taking down; but—well, 
come out with me and I’ll fix it with 
the cashier.”
Together they strode out. The office 
force applied itself mightily in the 
presence of the Man Higher Up, but 
they watched covertly and wondered 
at Forbes’s triumphant grin.
The pair paused at the cashier’s 
desk; and the salesman delighted in 
the fact that Perkins spoke loudly. 
All listened attentively.
“Simmons,” said the Big Boss, “this 
morning I sent you an order to raise 
the salary of Forbes, here, to one hun­
dred dollars a month. Cut it down to 
eighty!”
Trees and Sand
An agricultural colony in Palestine 
has just applied to the United States 
Forest Service for help in planting 
trees, to bind the drifting sands of the 
Mediterranean. The colony is near 
Jaffa, or Yafa, the ancient Joppa of 
the Bible, and there is being developed 
in connection with it a seaside resort, 
with hotels, villas, bath-houses, and 
gardens. The experts of the service 
point out that the reclamation of sand 
dunes is not a serious problem in the 
eastern United States because the pre­
vailing winds are from the land, and 
the sand is blown into the sea. On 
the west coast the situation is more 
serious. The most notable example 
of reclaimed sand areas there is furn­
ished by Golden Gate Park, San Fran­
cisco, where grasses, acacias, and, 
later, trees and shrubs, have converted 
sand wastes into pleasure-grounds of 
great beauty. The attention of the 
Palestine colony is called to the won­
derful reclamation of the Landes, 
France, where a wealth-producing 
forest of maritime pine—the source of 
the French turpentine — has been 
grown to take the place of shifting 
dunes.—The Outlook.
The General Electric Company an­
nounced today another important de­
velopment in electric lighting in the 
form of a new incandescent lamp, 
which consumes only half as much 
current per candle power as the pres- 
sent lamp.
The new lamp contains specially 
shaped Tungsten filaments and is 
filled with an inert gas, such as nitro­
gen, at a pressure of about the same 
as the atmosphere.
Thomas A. Edison developed the 
incandescent lamp in the early 80s. 
About six years ago the Tungsten 
metal filament lamp was produced, 
which reduced the consumption of 
energy from three to nearly one watt 
per candle power. The new lamp 
cuts this in half.—Case Tech.
The University of Michigan reports 
a total registration of 5229, exclusive 
of summer school students. There is 
a gain in all departments except law, 
where increased requirements have 
been installed, resulting in a loss of 
forty-five students.—Pennsylvanian.

THE DEANS’ COLUMN I• • • i
Letter from Dean Leete
To the Editor of The Tartan:
Those who have read Alice’s Ad­
ventures in Wonderland may remem­
ber that as Alice strolls about the 
Garden of Live Flowers in company 
with the Red Queen she is suddenly 
commanded to run—They run and 
run, for hours they run—but curious­
ly however fast they go, they never 
seem to pass anything. At last Alice 
sinks exhausted on the ground under 
the selfsame tree from which they had 
started. “Why I do believe we’ve 
been under this tree the whole time;” 
exclaims Alice. “In our country 
you’d generally get somewhere if you 
ran very fast for a long time, as we’ve 
been doing.” “A slow sort of coun­
try,” replies the Queen. “Now here 
you see, it takes all the running you 
can do to keep in the same place.”
This incident illustrates very aptly 
the conditions under which we are liv­
ing today. One must run and run fast 
even to keep up with modern prog­
ress. In the 17th century the edu­
cated man might know all about 
everything within the realm of the 
knowledge of his day. Today the 
frontiers of science have been pushed 
far out into new regions which even 
a few years ago were thought to be 
beyond the reach of human possibili­
ties. Science has made a new earth 
and almost a new heaven. All we can 
hope for is to know a little about 
some things, and to know one thing 
well. Specialization is not a matter 
of choice but of necessity. This we 
shall have to accept as proved beyond 
question.
Specialization has brought with it 
certain unfortunate conditions. The 
intensity of interest and the exacting 
demands necessary for success in the 
specialty has led to a neglect of prep­
aration for the other functions of the 
individual as a man and as a citizen. 
No man can live an absolutely inde­
pendent existence and any community 
life involves certain problems which 
can be solved only by the sharing of 
the common burden by every unit of 
that community, the specialist in­
cluded. In his preparation for know­
ing one thing well, he must not lose 
sight of the things about which he 
must know a little. Even among edu­
cated men the superficiality not to 
say the poverty of thought about gen­
eral matters of vital interest to the 
community is so great as to consti­
tute a real danger. In our churches 
we find congregations accepting 
creeds as an inheritance, and without 
personal convictions. In politics we 
follow one party organization blindly, 
and the man who has any intelligent 
opinions on even the big questions of 
the day is a rara avis. Even our 
political leadership' is like that of the 
demagogue of the French Revolution 
who exclaimed—“There go the people.
I must hurry to overtake them. I 
am their leader.”
In education and particularly in
technical education, this danger is even 
more apparent. The narrow special­
ist in chemistry thinks only in and of 
chemical formulae, the mathematician 
in differential equations, the electrical 
engineer in watts and the mechanical 
engineer in horse power. He resents 
any time taken from his speciality—in 
matters outside that specialty he has 
little interest or training and as a 
result has no dependable judgment. 
Such a man is not a unit in a com­
munity, he is what Dean West of 
Princeton calls “an intellectual frac­
tion,” which in matters of general im­
portance may be so small as to be 
negligible. Of such pedants Oliver 
Goldsmith wrote: “They generally
carried on a pretty traffic in some 
little creek; within that they busily 
plied about and drove an insignificant 
trade; but never ventured out into 
the great ocean of knowledge.” Now 
education, even the despised practical 
education, can and ought to produce 
something more than this. We must 
turn out the carefully trained engi­
neer, architect and artisan but beyond 
that we must and can turn out men 
with a human interest in general af­
fairs and a sense of responsibility to 
the community apart from' personal 
gain and advancement of the indivi­
dual.
The burden of work in a technical 
course often keeps the student’s eyes 
so close to his books that he fails 
to see some of the things really worth 
seeing in his school life. We may, 
therefore, well ask, “What may we 
reasonably expect from a college edu­
cation,”—and in particular, “What 
should a technical training produce?” 
If we read the addresses of such lead­
ers in college thought as President 
Emeritus Eliot of Harvard, President 
Butler of Columbia, ex-President 
Tucker of Dartmouth and indeed all 
the constructive thinkers in educational 
work we find that they all agree 
that the objects for which our 
colleges exist are—personal culture, 
superior qualifications for citizenship 
and altruistic service. The first named 
object, culture, is an inheritance from 
our sister colleges in England, which 
must be adapted to American condi­
tions. The second, scholarship, is a 
contribution from the ideal of the 
German University. The third, train­
ing for citizenship, is peculiarly im­
portant in a democracy. The fourth, 
disinterested service, finds its origin 
in the early history of the American 
College, when the prime reason for its 
establishment was preparation for serv­
ice in the church or state, but is today 
of more importance than ever before.
Is technical education producing 
the gentleman, the scholar, the valu­
able citizen, the man of disinterested 
service? I wish that every student of 
the Institute might read the addresses 
of these leaders in college life, but 
that is probably too much to expect. 
In the monthly letters you have asked 
me to write I shall attempt to discuss 
these four points from the standpoint 
of the technical institution. As a mat­
ter of fact, the differences in the pur-
poses and possibilities of the academic 
and technical institutions are not 
great, for culture, scholarship, good 
citizenship and real service are mat­
ters of attitude rather than of attain­
ment.
JOHN H. LEETE.
Dr. Arthur F. E. Ungnad, former 
Professor of Oriental Philology in 
Jena University, said that Pennsyl­
vania, Harvard, and John Hopkins 
are considered in Germany the great 
American colleges.

FOUNDER SENDS LETTER
Continued from Page 1 
was received with much enthusiasm.
A letter from Mr. Carnegie was read 
before the ceremony of conferring 
the degree. The communication fol­
lows:
“Dear Dr. Hamerschlag:
“Yours of November 10 received. 
Certainly you will never confer a de­
gree of doctor of engineering upon a 
more deserving recipient than Wil­
liam McConway, whose unrewarded 
services to the Carnegie Institute ev­
ery trustee and official recognizes and 
extols. A man of pure gold, solid, 
unassuming and persistent, and pos­
sessed in full measure of that rare 
article, sound judgment.!
“I wish I could have the personal 
pleasure of witnessing the honor con­
ferred; but though absent in body I 
shall be with you in spirit, and my 
birthday will be suffused with the glow 
of pleasure arising from the action 
of the Institute of Technology on 
that day in recognizing the invaluable 
service rendered it by one I am proud 
to call my friend.
“With renewed congratulations up­
on the exceptional success of the in­
stitute under your management.'
“Sincerely yours,
“ANDREW CARNEGIE.”
Mr. McConway appeared on the 
platform in cap and gown. Three bars 
across the breast and three on each 
sleeve denoted the rank of doctor. 
The hood, a work of art, was lined 
with the Carnegie plaid, the material 
being the original presented by Mr. 
Carnegie to Mrs. Hamerschlag. The 
hood was faced with orange, denoting 
the engineering degree, and a narrow 
strip of blue denoted the school from 
which the degree came, the School of 
Applied Science at Tech. A sheep­
skin tied with blue ribbon made the 
presentation complete.
Director Hamerschlag conferred 
the degree in a speech lauding Mr. 
McConway. Mr. McConway in re­
sponding urged the students to take 
interest in civic affairs and commend­
ed “The Politics” of Aristotle for their 
study.
At the conclusion of the exercises 
in music hall a reception was held 
in the lobby and Dr. McConway re­
ceived the congratulations of many 
friends and educators, including Dr. 
S. B. McCormick, chancellor of the 
University of Pittsburgh; Dr. Henry
D. Lindsay, president of Pennsylvania 
College for Women, and Very Rev. M. 
A. Hehir, president of Duquesne Uni­
versity. Mr. Schwab also was greeted 
by many Pittsburgh acquaintances.
In the evening Director and Mrs. 
Hamerschlag entertained in their 
home with a dinner, covers being laid 
for 24. The guests of honor were Dr. 
and Mrs. McConway, Mr. Schwab and 
Mrs. Hart, now a resident of Big 
Timber, Mont.
WIRELESS CLUB GETS CORE 
FOR NEW 3 K. W. TRANS­
FORMER.
The Pittsburgh Transformer Co. 
has donated to the Wireless Club a 
steel core which will be used as the 
foundation of a new transformer. 
This donation is greatly appreciated 
by the members as a core of this 
quality and type is worth twenty-five 
dollars.
As soon as the new tower is com­
pleted on the machinery hall an aerial 
will be stretched from there to the 
chimney across the hollow. With 
these improvements the club can talk 
to all the large schools in the vicinity 
of the Great Lakes. More students 
are urged to join this club, the dues 
are small and the benefits large; the 
club meets every Thursday at 5 P. M. 
at room 209 Science Building.
CRUCIBLE CLUB MEETING.
The first meeting of the Crucible 
Club for the school year was held in 
the Crucible Club room on Friday, 
November 21st. Owing to the failure 
of the president, Frank Ernst, to re­
turn to Tech this year, the club was 
late in starting but we hope to make 
up for lost time.
The first meeting was entirely de­
voted to business. Vice President 
Corbett occupied the chair. On mo­
tion of North, the vice president was 
nominated for the presidency and he 
was unanimously elected. An election 
for vice president was then held and 
Kinch of the Junior class was elected. 
The club officers are now:
President—Corbett.
Vice President—Kinch.
Treasurer—Douthett.
Secretary—Thomas.
A committee was appointed to look 
after the club room and it was decided 
to attempt some decoration of it and 
make it in every respect a club room 
for the members. The club officers 
hope to see every member at every 
meeting.
“Does your daughter play Wein- 
iawski?” asked the musical guest. “If 
she does,” replied Comrox, “she al­
ways loses. She never says a word 
to me about it.”—Washington Star.
Love is like a telephone conversa­
tion. You talk to each other and you 
say things, but neither of you can see 
the other’s real self, nor tell precisely 
what he or she means.

UPPER CLASS TO HOLD SERIES 
OF BANQUETS.
The Upper Class of the School of 
Applied Industries intend to make 
their Senior year at Carnegie one that 
they will all remember as one of 
good-fellowship.
They decided at a recent class meet­
ing to hold a series of banquets dur­
ing the remainder of the year, these 
banquets to occur at least once a 
month.
They will be held at the Fort Pitt 
Hotel and some sort of a program will 
be arranged for every banquet by a 
committee that will be selected at 
a future meeting of the class.
PLEBE NIGHT SCIENCE CLASS 
POSTPONES STAGG.
At a meeting held Monday evening, 
November 24th, the first year Night 
Science Class postponed their initial 
smoker to a future date. This was 
done in order that the Annual Night 
Science Smoker, being held soon un­
der the auspices of the Second Year 
Night Men, should be a success.
The class, therefore, intends to turn 
out in full to this next affair, and will 
lend every affort in making it one 
of the best ever held.
A motor truck costing $725 has been 
added to Detroit’s equipment, and is 
saving several $5,000 machines many 
miles, with resulting economy. The 
machine is used by the police depart­
ment and makes a round of all the 
police stations every day picking up 
what property has been transferred 
to the central office, taking orders, 
and delivering supplies. Formerly, 
whenever property taken from a 
prisoner had to be placed in the 
central office, two men would take 
out the station patrol for the work, 
even when the “property” was only 
a flask of whisky. If the desk ser­
geant needed a pad of report blanks 
the patrol was sent for it. These ma­
chines cost $5,000, and run at an ex­
pense of 8 cents a mile. Last year 
the patrols rolled up a total mileage 
of 115,000 miles, much of it being 
small side trips. This work is now 
done by the small machine, and the 
police commissioner expects to reduce 
the mileage of the patrols to at least
80,000 by using them only for actual 
work in transporting prisoners.

A SCHOOL FOR HEALTH 
OFFICERS.
(Article published in “The Outlook” 
'of Oct. 18, 1913.)
Still another announcement of im­
portance has come from Harvard 
Medical School, this time acting in 
co-operation with the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. In recogni­
tion of the growing demand from 
cities and towns for men familiar with 
the latest discoveries in preventive 
medicine and the newest developments 
of modern sanitary engineering, these 
two institutions have established a 
graduate school for health officers.
The interest of even the most cap­
able physician, trained in the ordinary 
college of medicine, is naturally di­
rected more towards the individual 
than towards the public at large. He 
has been trained to cure cases rather 
than to remove causes. To ask him 
to lead an assault upon the strong­
holds of disease is in some measure 
like asking a surgeon to take com­
mand of troops in the field.
To the end of training a body of 
men capable of approaching the prob­
lem of community health from the 
combined standpoints of the physician, 
the civil engineer, and the sociologist, 
this new school offers a thorough 
course comprising lectures, laboratory 
work, and opportunities for wide 
practical experience. “It is recog­
nized,” says the announcement of the 
school, “that the requirements for 
public health service are broad and 
complicated, and that the country 
needs leaders in every community fit­
ted to guide and instruct the people in 
the art of hygienic living; qualified to 
direct the expenditure of energy, time, 
and money in public health work into 
fruitful channels; and able to initiate
plans to meet novel conditions as they 
arise. It is the object of the School 
for Health Officers to provide the 
scientific groundwork of sanitary 
knowledge which underlies efficient 
health administration. . . . The
subjects embraced in the courses of 
study have been selected to cover a 
wide range, including medical, biolo­
gical, hygienic, and engineering sci­
ences, together with practical health 
administration.”
Not the least interesting thing 
about this new school is the fact that 
the great resources of both Harvard 
University and of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology are alike open 
to the prospective student. Many ef­
forts in the past have been made to 
bring these neighboring institutions 
together on some common ground. It 
is pleasant to record the news that 
they have at last found a field for 
active co-operation.
The coach of the University of 
Minnesota has a dummy on which his 
men practice interference. The mani­
kin has a curved bottom, filled with 
lead so that when it is knocked down 
it will spring back into place. The 
player is supposed to knock this 
dummy down without using his hands.
The freshmen of the University of 
Wyoming have a much more forceful 
way of manifesting their class spirit 
than by merely writing “17” on the 
standpipe. On a hill overlooking the 
campus they have dug, at great cost 
of labor, a huge “W,” fifty feet high 
and eighty feet wide.
Coach Grady, of the Northwestern 
university, has a device to make his 
football players either tackle low or 
break their necks. It is a wire 
stretched three feet above the ground 
in front of the tackling dummy.
A bank that is strong in assets, in 
men, in courtesy and in the desire to 
make its services of practical value to 
every man or woman who favors it with 
his or her account.

CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi­
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom’ 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re­
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan,

The board of visitors of the Uni­

ments to lease ground to those fra­
ternities, desiring to build houses, 
for a period of ninety-nine years with 
privilege of renewal and also to lend 
money for them providing satisfactory 
financial arrangements can be made 
and also provided that the plans pro­
posed for the houses meet with the 
approval of the board.—Daily Texan.
DUQUESNE—“PAID IN FULL.’
Mr. Harry Davis has secured the 
exclusive rights for Eugene Walter’s 
thrilling drama, “Paid in Full” and 
it will be the offering of the Harry 
Davis Players at the Duquesne for 
next week. With the possible excep­
tion of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” no play 
has ever created the interest or made
the money for both author and pro­
ducer as has “Paid in Full.” It was 
the first of a series of plays that 
brought fame and wealth to Eugene 
Walter. It is needless to state that 
this production of “Paid in Full” by 
the Davis Players will equal in every 
way the original production in New 
York.
We recommend the merchants advertising in the Tartan as the best in town. They will give you the best prices and quality.
