(OltWEMENI EYENIS ADVANCED ONE DAY
Special Efforts Made To Make This 
Commencement Best in Years.
REPORT Of RESTAURANE TECH DOWNS W. (41. SECRETARY FIELD
All events of Commencement Week 
have been pushed forward one day 
in order that the presentation of the 
“Mikado” by the Choral Club on 
Class Day night for the public of 
Pittsburgh might not be in conflict 
with the opera of “Siegfried’’ at 
Forbes Field.
On Sunday, June 9th, at 10:00 A. 
M., Director Hamerschlag will de­
liver the Baccalaureate Address in the 
theatre of the Design School, for fac­
ulty and students; and in the evening 
at 8:15 o’clock a sacred concert will 
be given by the Symphony Orches­
tra for all. The concert this year 
will surpass anything ever attempted 
in previous years.
In keeping with the ideals of 
“Tech’’ that each year’s Commence­
ment exercises shall be more beauti­
ful and impressive than those preced­
ing, the coming exercises, which take 
place in the Music Hall at 10:00 A. 
M. Thursday, June 8th, have been 
planned with careful attention to 
every detail. The Central committee

PLETELY FILLED.
Authorities Live Up To Statement 
Made Last Year.

Unprecedented Demand for Tickets.
Third Performance Will be 
Given Class Day.
The publicity committee of the 
Choral Club finds itself in a most un­
usual prepdicument. So successful 
has been the advertizing campaign 
carried on through the agency of the 
Tartan that all theatre and dance 
tickets had been disposed of before 
the committee, was able to spread the 
campus with a large number of post­
ers which had been beautifully exe­
cuted by students of design in the De­
sign School.
The Choral Club, as a new and 
comparatively unknown organization, 
is anxious to secure as much publicity 
as possible this year, hoping to create 
such favorable sentiment towards the 
work of the Club as will insure to 
it the support of the Student body, 
in the event that the Annual Play is 
given at some large theatre next year. 
Nevertheless the publicity commit­
tee has withheld its advertising from 
the student body feeling that it was 
unfair to arouse interest in a per­
formance which could not be attend-

When, on September 16th, 1915, the 
school restaurant was opened to the 
student body, the statement was made 
that the restaurant would be con­
ducted on a no-profit basis, and that 
it was the intention of the authorities 
to spend for food actually purchased 
.8iy2 per cent of the money charged 
the students.
In spite of the fact that since that 
time both the cost of foodstuffs and 
the price of labor have materially in­
creased, the following figures fur­
nished by the school accountant will 
show how closely the above statement 
has been made good.
Total receipts .......................$32,213.02
Total expenditures ............. 32,090.63
Total Profits ......................... $132.59
The total expenditures, analyzed, 
show that
$25,960.69 were spent for food,
5,596.70 were spent for labor,
533.24 were spent for replace­
ments,
giving a percentage list for expenses 
as follows:
Food, 80.5% of total receipts 
Labor, 17.4% of total receipts 
Replacements, 2.1% of total receipts
But these figures convey only part 
of the real values of the work done 
by the restaurant in behalf of the stu­
dent body.
Twenty-four students have been 
employed and been served 10.714 
meals, representing approximately 
$2,140.00. All non-resident students 
who cared to avail themselves of the 
opportunity, were given free, on 
Thanksgiving day, an elaborate and 
expensive dinner. The different ath­
letic squads have been taken care of 
by the restaurant at a cost represent­
ing solely the cost of food purchased. 
The different student organizations 
utilizing Carnegie Union have been 
charged, for food provided them, 
prices covering the actual wholesale 
cost of material and nothing more.
All this may explain why, on a vol­
ume of business amounting to $32,- 
213.02 the profits represented for a 
whole year’s work, effort and 
thought, are only forty-one hun­
dredths of one per cent.
JUNE 7th, SENIOR BALL, RIT 
TENHOUSE, 9 P. M. ASSESS­
MENT OF $5.50.
Saturday was slugging day for the 
Tech team and they not only amused 
the crowd by straightening out the 
offerings of one Mr. Stewart, who 
pretends to throw curves and all that, 
but also gamboled around the bases 
and just naturally made things very 
uncomfortable for the visiting play­
ers.
Hines and Zehfuss were the chief 
offenders, our new catcher and lead- 
off man getting 3 hits and 3 runs in 
4 trips to the plate, while “Pick” 
pitched his usual good game and 
fielded his position faultlessly.
The W. & J. team was slightly off 
form and although they shdwed plenty 
of fight when the ball was in the 
pitcher’s hand, their pep vanished 
while the fielders chased it to vari­
ous corners of the lot. Our boys 
started the scoring, and after getting 
one run lead in the first inning they 
were never in danger. W. & J. had 
numerous chances to score, but it was 
not until the sixth inning that they 
sent their first man across. In the 
meantime, we had added a couple of 
runs and at the end of the seventh, 
had a lead of four. At this stage of 
the game Hines was taken out, so 
that Wean could get in on the party, 
and he and McCreight finished.
Stewart started things for W. & J. 
in the first inning, when he drew a 
base on balls, stole second on the 
first ball pitched and went all the way 
to third when Zehfuss threw into cen­
ter. Bixler lined one at Mason and 
the plucky first baseman brought the 
crowd to its feet (he got up, but she 
didn’t) by making a pretty stop and 
throw to the plate, getting Stewart. 
Heyman singled but it was too late.
We tallied in our half on consecu­
tive hits by Zehfuss, Mason and Doh­
erty. Smith came up with runners 
on second and third, but he hit into 
the second baseman’s hands and was 
out.
Again in the second, we had men on 
second and third, after Hines had 
been passed and Zehfuss doubled, but 
no one could produce the necessary 
single.
Both teams got a man as far as 
second in the next inning, but couldn't 
score.
Molner opened the fourth with a 
Texas leaguer to right, and reached 
second when Taggart let the next 
ball get away from him. Zehfuss con­
tributed his third hit of the game, 
scoring Molner and counting, himself,

TENDERS RESIGNATION
Has Been With School Since 1904. 
To Stay Remainder of Year.
The Director announces the resig­
nation of Mr. William P. Field, Sec­
retary of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. Although it 'has not 
been generally known, Mr. Field ten­
dered his resignation more than a 
month ago, in order to enter other 
fields of work. He will remain with 
the school during the remainder of 
the year, to conclude his many duties, 
to which he has always given him­
self unsparingly.
Mr. Field is a native of Geneva, N. 
Y. He obtained his early education 
at that place, later going to Yale Uni­
versity, where he graduated in 1896. 
He became a member of the executive 
staff of the schools in 1904, with title 
of Assistant Secretary and was ad­
vanced to his present post in 1906.
Mr. Field expects to spend the en­
tire summer at his home.

MR. FIELD’S RESIGNATION.
It is with the keenest regret that 
we receive the news of Mr. Field’s 
resignation. Mr. Field has been with 
the school since its beginning, hold­
ing positions of trust and responsi­
bility. He has given himself unspar­
ingly to the tasks which were alloted 
to him in developing his office. As 
evidence of the esteem in which Mr. 
Field is held, we are certain that 
the trustees, administrative staff, fac­
ulty and students will all join in ex­
pressions of regret that he has de­
cided to leave us. The Director will 
feel his absence keenly because of the 
close personal associations which have 
existed for years, and because of the 
comradship and friendship that 
brought Mr. Field from New York 
shortly after Mr. Hamerschlag be­
came Director.
There is little new that can be said 
of “Billy,” we all ktiow him, for he
has become one of the cherished 
landmarks of Tech, and just how it 
will seem to see a new face in his 
sanctum in the Administration Build­
ing we cannot predict. We do know 
that it won’t seem right, and it will 
be a long time before we shall for­
get this man, who at all times endeav­
ored to do anything in his power for 
the students and for Tech.
We extend to Mr. Field our heart­
iest appreciation for the many kind­
nesses he has rendered, and wish to 
extend our sincerest wishes to him 
for success in every future undertak­
ings.
“THE BEANERY.”
During the year we have upon sev­
eral occasions been requested to make 
some comment in our editorial col­
umns concerning our “dining room,” 
or what what is more commonly 
known as “the Beanery.” Not wish­
ing to jump too hastily at conclusions, 
we thoroughly investigated the 
grounds for this suggestion. We 
talked with individuals whom we con­
sidered as being typical in represent­
ing all sorts of tastes, appetites, likes, 
and dislikes. We interviewed the 
management of the restaurant, and 
furthermore bought a beanery meal 
tickets ourselves! As a result of our 
investigation, a financial statement of 
the beanery appears in other columns 
of this issue.
And now, having all this compre; 
hensive data on hand, we feel in a 
position to make the requested com­
ment, and have come to the conclu­
sion that the beanery is deserving of 
our most unqualified appreciation. 
Not only is this appreciation due to 
the management for its efforts, but 
for the actual value it has proven it­
self to be, to the student body. For 
the benefit of the few who may think 
that the beanery is a money making 
scheme, we would like to draw at­
tention to the fact, that the figures 
show that the net profits realized on 
a volume of business representing 
$32,000, was less than one-half of one 
per cent! The value of the employ­
ment offered to the students exceed­
ed the sum of $2,000
It may be true that some, say even 
a majority of us, have from time to 
time disliked one or even several 
meals. But we ask, must it not be a 
difficult task indeed to undertake to 
supply such a cosmopolitan aggrega­
tion, and endeavor to satisfy every 
one? It seems to us that the man 
who continually brings out the ham­
mer to knock such a worthy part of 
the school is the one who is deserv­
ing of editorial criticism, and not the 
beanery. Does the one who contin- 
tinually complains ever stop to think 
and consider to what great inconven­
ience he would be placed without this 
accommodation? Supposing that it 
were necessary to make a trip to Oak­
land or Craig street in the short hour 
at noon, or to eat a cold meal? And 
how convenient it has been to have 
the school restaurant at hand when 
smokers or other entertainments have 
been given!
We do not say that the beanery 
could not be improved, but we do
maintain that it is doing infinitely 
more for the school than the indivi­
dual who continually complains, and 
a great deal more than it is given 
credit for. Let us take more care 
of careless remarks, stop to think be­
fore you complain, that you yourself 
are perhaps a pretty hard person to 
please, and realize the problem that 
the beanery is confronting in attempt­
ing to satisfy everyone with a meal, 
which must come within the narrow 
buying limits of twenty cents, is a 
very difficult one.
NATIONAL MEN AGREE WITH 
US.
To the Editor:
At a meeting of the Pan-Hellenic 
Society, which is composed of Na­
tional Fraternity Men who have no 
chapter at Carnegie Tech, held on 
Wednesday night, May 17, the gen­
eral attitude of the various locals at 
school was brought up. We were 
pleased to note that the men of the 
different local fraternities were very 
cordial to one another in and about 
school. We did note, however, that 
at home the locals were quite re­
served, and that they mingled but 
very little in one another’s houses. 
We think that this attitude is prob­
ably due to the youth of the frater­
nities, and hope that it will be chang­
ed in the near future.
Mention of the article recently pub­
lished in the Tartan was made, and 
through discussion, it was brought 
out that you had expressed the very 
sentiment of the National Men here 
at Tech. One thing that the Pan- 
Hellenic men hope to do, is to bring 
out the importance of the Fraternity 
at Large, to the student body, and we 
believe that this can not be done un­
less the members of the different lo­
cals are willing to make known, 
either through your columns, or by 
other means, their social activities. 
We do not recommend or advise 
“cheap publicity,” and we do not be­
lieve that you would print such mate­
rial, but we do think that each Fra­
ternity should make known what it 
is doing for Carnegie Tech, and the 
Fraternity at Large in a social way.
Very truly yours,
The Pan Hellenic Society of C. I. T.
Edward Baker, 
President.
SCIENCE FACULTY HOLDS 
DINNER.
The last Science Faculty dinner of 
the year was held on Tuesday even­
ing, May 16th, at the Hotel Schenley. 
The speakers were Director Hamer­
schlag and Dr. Bingham.
ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION 
DANCE.
The dance held under the auspices 
of the Athletic Association, last Fri­
day evening in Carnegie Union was 
one of the most brilliant affairs of the 
season. A large crowd was in at­
tendance and a neat sum was real­
ized for the benefit of the association.
A. CARNEGIE ELECTED PRESI­
DENT OF MUSICAL CLUBS.
At a meeting of the Musical Clubs, 
held in Carnegie Union last Sunday 
afternoon, Andrew Carnegie, who has 
been manager of the clubs this year, 
was elected to the presidency for the 
1916-17 season, and H. A. Weber, this 
year’s librarian, was elected to the 
managership. Other elections were: 
Ass’t Manager, John J. Pannabaker, 
Publicity Manager, Harry A. Madi­
son, Stage Manager, Arthur W. Ein­
stein, Glee Club Librarian, Robert 
Spring, Mandolin Club Librarian, 
Wm. W. Headings. The office of 
the Secretary and Treasurer has been 
abolished, the duties of this office 
having been taken up by the Student 
Activities manager, Gerhardt.
The 1915-16 season has been the 
most successful season of any Tech 
Musical clubs, from both a musical 
and a financial standpoint, and the 
men are to be commended for the 
fine showing made and the work done 
at all concerts.
Upon recommendation of the ex­
ecutive committee of the Musical 
Clubs, the Student Activities Board 
has awarded the insignia, a heavy 
gold seal ring, to the following men:
G. C. Baker, H. R. Hoffman, S. J. Mc­
Nulty, F. L. Sharpe, C. B. Coe, H. O.

INDUSTRIES NEWS.
The last meeting of the Student 
Assembly was held last Wednesday. 
Dean Connelley gave a short talk and 
presented the trophy, won by the class 
of 1916, in the recent inter-class meet. 
Members of the graduating class also 
gave short talks, as is the custom 
each year at the last meeting. The 
officers for the coming year were 
elected, and are as follows:
President—R. K. Merker.
Vice President—J. J. Downes. 
Secretary—C. K. Koontz.
Treasurer—P. L. A. Keiser.
The upper class held a meeting last 
Friday afternoon. The date of the 
Senior ball was set for Monday even­
ing, June 5th, at the Fort Pitt Hotel 
and the annual baseball game between 
the faculty and the graduating class 
was announced for Tuesday after­
noon, June 6th.
Liggett, Miller, M. F. Murphy and 
Parker, of the Upper class, and Bruce 
and Dockstader, of the Middle class, 
have enrolled for the U. S. military 
training camp to be held at Platts- 
burg.
A letter was received recently from 
Hubert Hall, formerly of the Upper 
class, who was obliged to return to 
his home in Erie, Fa., in the early 
spring, owing to ill health. “Hallie” 
states that he has fully recovered, and 
will return to school in the fall.
TECH THIRD IN MEET. PENN 
STATE WINS.
Annual Pitt Interscholastics and Col­
legiate Meet.
With Penn State and Pitt ahead of 
them, Tech took third place in the 
Pitt Interscholastic and Collegiate 
meet at the oval on Saturday, coming 
in ahead of Grove City and W. and J. 
The final score stood: Penn State 
96 1-2, Pitt 91, Tech 16 1-2, Grove 
City 9, W. & J 6.
Hemman captured third place in the 
four-forty, while Smith took fourth 
in the two-twenty. These, coupled 
with Lawson’s fourth in the two-mile, 
Ellerton’s places in both shot and 
discus, and the accomplishments of 
Haub’s jumping prowesss, a tie for 
first, completed Tech’s scoring.
Pitt and Penn State staged a genu­
ine duel and up to the very last min­
ute they were very close in score. 
Palmer’s second in the broad jump 
was all that saved the day for Penn 
State.
Shaw High cleaned up the scholas­
tic events just like she did at the Tech 
meet last year.
C. I. T. ECONOMIC SOCIETY.
At the last meeting of the society, 
the following officers were elected for 
the ensuing year: A. H. Schütz,
president; H. Alpern, vice-president; 
and C. C. Greiner, secretary-treas- 
urer. The new committee hopes to 
make possible an open forum for the 
study of social and economic prob­
lems of today.
TECH LOSES HARD GAME TO 
STATE, 5-3.
Visitor’s Hits Come When Needed. 
Doherty and Baughman Star.
That Penn State baseball team man­
aged to pull together for just one in­
ning, the seventh, and beat us after 
they had been out-hit and out-fielded 
during the whole game. It was a 
hard game to lose, but State deserves 
credit for finding a pitcher like Baugh­
man, for it was he that turned our 
batters back when hits were needed, 
and his record o/ 11 strike-outs 
proves his effectiveness. There was 
one man, however, who never came 
back—that diminutive shortstop of 
ours, always got to first, twice on 
hits, once on a base on balls, and the 
other occasion was a double. “Doc” 
also made several good plays in the 
field, two of his sto^s cutting off ex­
tra base hits.
Cold weather prevailed (the foot­
ball men and hockey players were out 
in full force), and everyone had to 
step lively to keep warm. At times 
there were heated arguments—Mr. 
Richard Guy was calling strikes and 
balls, mostly strikes.
We threatened to score in the sec­
ond inning, when Doherty led off with 
a double. Yeager struck out, much 
heat felt near the batter’s box. Smith 
lined one too hot for Johnson, and 
reached first, Doherty going to third. 
“Smitty” froze about three feet off 
first, and was out. Lundell was 
thrown out by Blythe.
Baughman teased us in the third, 
after striking out Molner. Hines and 
Zehfuss both singled, and then he re­
tired the side by striking out Gano 
and Mason.
Mingle got the fi*st hit for State, 
in the fourth. Robinson lined to Ma­
son, and then Johnson knocked one 
behind the old backstop for four 
bases, sending Mingle in ahead of 
him.
Doherty opened our half with a 
single, the ball hitting third base. 
Yeager took two strikes attempting 
to sacrifice, and then singled. “Doc” 
was caught trying to make third, but 
Blythe threw the ball back into cen­
ter field, and he scored, Yeager tak­
ing third. Smith singled to center 
field and “Yeag” romped home. Lun­
dell contributed the fourth consecu­
tive hit of the inning, and “Smity” 
went to second. Molner bunted and 
Smith was forced at third. Hines 
also bunted and Lundell was caught 
at third. Zehfuss popped to Johnson.
Neither team got another hit until 
the seventh, but there were several 
spectacular plays which intervened.
In the fifth, Moore walked, and 
Baughman attempted to sacrifice. 
Hines made a fast throw to first and 
Mason relayed the ball to “Doc,” in 
time to double Moore at second— 
some quick work.
The sixth inning produced three 
sensational plays,—and three heroes. 
Mingle opened with a hot one over 
second. Molner made a desperate 
reach for the ball, caught it on his 
bare hand and got the runner at first. 
Then Robinson hit a little pop fly 
to right, it looked like a safe hit, but
Lundell came in for it on a dead run. 
He hade a dive, falling headlong on 
the ground, but the ball stuck in his 
glove and State lost another hit. 
Johnson was the last man up and he 
caught one of “Pick’s” slants and 
sent it toward third, about four bases 
a minute. “Smitty” put both hands 
up (one never could have held it) 
and held on tightly until he came 
down to earth again,—some stop.
In the seventh, State bunched four 
hits with an error and a passed ball, 
for three runs. He scored again in 
the eighth on Dohertys single and 
Smith’s double, but Baughman struck 
out two batters and it was all off.

NEW YORK STATE CLUB 
HOLDS SMOKER.
The New York State Club held a 
smoker in the Science Club Room 
last Wednesday evening, at which 
time a meeting was also held. A new 
constitution was adopted, and offi­
cers were elected for the coming year. 
The men elected are:
President—C. F. Hofstetter, Hor- 
nell, N. Y.
Vice-President—M. E. Green, Ker- 
honksons N. Y.
Secretary of Treasury—G. F. Hun­
ter, Canisteo, N. Y.
About 40 men were present and all 
greatly enjoyed the entertainment, 
which consisted of Magic, by Glad- 
stein, and Music, by Sorber, K. Web­
er and L. C. Smith.
CLASS DAY BIG AFFAIR.
Concert, “Spreads” and Mikado Pro­
duction.
Wednesday, June 6th, will witness 
the annual Class Day stunts, in which 
“Tech” men break the tension of ex­
amination week and throw dullness 
and propriety overboard. Great mys­
tery shrouds the events of the day, 
each class is jealously guarding the 
plans for its particular stunt, and mys­
terious conferences are the order of 
the day. The Science Sophomores 
are out to repeat their triumph of the 
Science Stag and the Industries lower 
men are camping on the trail of the 
other two classes. All this activity 
portends the most successful Class 
Day at “Tech,” which properly begins 
at four o’clock in the afternoon and 
until six o’clock, the classes have the 
platform. Between six and eight, it 
has been suggested that a caterer be 
secured to serve a lunch, for which 
the Seniors could sell the tickets and 
thus do away with the necessity of 
leaving the campus to secure lunch­
eon; and after eight o’clock the Chor­
al Club will present the open air pro­
duction of the “Mikado’’ for the gen­
eral public. A stage will be erected in 
the angle between Dr. Esquerre’s of­
fice in the Industries School and the 
first wing on the west, while the 
guests and students will be seated on 
the lawn or on benches over the 
grounds. The same evening the Sen­
ior Class holds its final ball of the 
season. During all intermissions in 
the program the band will play from 
the platform.
TECH TO BE HOST TO PREP 
SCHOOLS.
Annual Interscholastics and Bethany 
Dual On Saturday.
Next Saturday’s track attractions 
are about the most important of any 
so far this year. The Tech Inter­
scholastics are always heralded with 
enthusiasm by the representatives of 
that sport in the various Western 
Pennsylvania High and Prep schools. 
Last year Shaw High of Cleveland, 
with only a few men entered, got 
away with first honors. This year 
Shaw unfortunately could not arrange 
to be here. About twenty other High 
Schools, however, have filed entry 
blanks and will get a good chance to 
show just what they can do. With 
this one exception the entries are 
about the same as last year, and in­
clude the chief High Schools of this 
district.
Tech track athletes will also be btisv 
trying to get the best of Bethany 
College in the Dual, which will be 
run off at the same time as the Inter 
scholastics. Workouts have been in 
order daily all last week and the 
track men hope to reach a pinnacle 
in form, which hitherto has only been 
at par.
Practically all arrangements for the 
meet such as officials, etc., have been 
arranged for by Manager Bill Schwer 
in and with good weather everything 
should be run off in apple pie order.

CLASS ELECTION.
The following girls were elected as 
officers of next year’s senior class:
President—Margaret Wirth.
Vice President—Florence Bingham.
Secretary—Agnes Wright.
Treasurer—Kathryn Mullen.
Student Government Representa­
tive—Miriam Weikert.
Social Chairman—Helen Wassel.
This will be the second time Miss 
Wirth has served as president of her 
class. Having been so successful last 
year in the performance of her du­
ties, it was thought that she would 
be equally successful next year.
TEA FOR SENORS.
Last Thursday afternoon the Jun­
iors of the Household Economics De­
part ment gave a tea for the Seniors 
in the Little House. The apartment 
was very prettily decorated with 
flowers, lilies of the valley predomi­
nating. Each honor guest received a 
corsage bouquet of the same flower, 
tied with a bow of yellow ribbon.
The color scheme of the afternoon 
was yellow and green, the Senior 
Class colors. Sherbet, cakes, 
candy and nuts constituted the re­
freshments.
In the receiving line were Miss 
Margaret Wirth, president of the Jun­
ior class, Miss Hanna and Miss Lyon.
The Delta Theta Sorority entertain­
ed with a card party and dance in 
the Recreation hall, Saturday evening, 
May 13th. The early part of the 
evening was spent at 500. After re­
freshments were served, the hall was 
cleared |and the remainder of t?he 
evening passed in dancing. At the 
close of the hour the guests depart­
ed, expressing their appreciation of 
such a good time.
CAMP CARNEGIE OPENS JULY 1.
New Schedule Arranged.
The 1916 season of Camp Louise 
Carnegie of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology will be held this summer 
between the dates of July 1 and Aug­
ust 15, at the usual camping grounds 
along the bank of the Allegheny river, 
between Glencairn and Garver’s Falls, 
Pa. The camp is a camp of instruc­
tion for women and is open to the 
students, alumnae, office staff, faculty 
and prospective students of Tech. 
There are pleasant accommodations 
for forty persons in the large man­
sion house, which is situated on the 
camp property.
During the six weeks of summer 
outing there will be a regular sched­
ule of exercise, play, study, and work 
and abundant opportunities for swim­
ming, rowing, tennis, and scout 
tramping. For those who are not up
in these sports there will be teachers 
on hand to give instruction in them. 
Pastimes of a less strenuous sort will 
be provided in courses in basketry, 
arts and crafts, and nature study. Ar­
rangements have also been made at 
a livery at Freeport for horses for 
any of the girls who want to go rid­
ing or driving.
Miss Ruth Mason, assistant in­
structor in the Department of Physi­
cal Education of the Margaret Mor­
rison Carnegie School will be in 
charge of the Camp and she expects 
to operate this year’s camp along the 
same lines of those which have been 
so successful in the New England 
states.
One of the features of the camp is 
that members in attendance, by mak­
ing previous notice can have their 
friends come and visit them. Week­
end parties are also to be arranged.
The campers will board at the man­
sion house, the table being supplied 
with farm products, country milk, 
cream, eggs, poultry, and vegetables 
from the Carnegie Farm.
The fee for board, room and in­
struction will be $6.00 a week. Res­
ervations should be made in advance, 
accompanied by a deposit of $3.00, 
the balance to be paid upon arrival 
at the camp. Visitors will be accom­
modated at the rate of $1.50 a day. 
Train service on the Allegheny Val­
ley Division of the Pennsylvania 
Railroad has been arranged for with 
stops both at Glencairn and Garvers 
Ferry.
It is hoped that those expecting to 
take in the camp this summer will 
plan on spending at least two weeks. 
Reservations should now be made 
with Mrs. Philpot, Secretary of the 
Margaret Morrison School. Mrs. 
Philpot will furnish any additional in­
formation about the camp desired.
PAN-HELLENIC SOCIETY TO 
MEET.
Informal Supper and Meeting To Be 
Held Next Saturday.
The Pan-Hellenic Society have se­
lected a table in the Beanery, at which 
they expect to eat every noon time. 
All National men without a chapter 
at Tech are cordially invited to eat 
with us at that table.
The Pan-Hellenic Society will hold 
an informal supper and meeting on 
Saturday night, May 27, at one of 
the nearby restaurants. Every Na­
tional man without a chapter at Tech 
is urged to get there, whether he be 
Faculty member or student. Please 
keep the date open, and watch bulle­
tin boards for definite arrangements.

INDUSTRIES INTER-CLUB 
DANCE.
INDUSTRY NOTES.
Mr. Taylor has 71 students from 
the Metallurgical, Mining and Elec­
trical Engineering courses. Mr. Hart­
man has 90.
After a week of work, the nice, new 
white overalls have gotten dirty, and 
the blisters on the men’s hands are 
gradually disappearing.
Several new cuss words were in­
vented and from time to time dem­
onstrated, in the Machine Shop dur­
ing the time assigned to chipping, 
when some chipper missed his chisel 
and hit his hand.
The Science men take two weeks 
of shops now, in the latter part of 
May, and two weeks in the latter 
part of next January. This is a new 
system. Formerly they came for 
short periods during the entire semes­
ter.
Dad White complains that the Sci­
ence men forget their check numbers.
E. R. Wolfe, of last year’s Middle 
Machine class, and who is at pres-
ent employed by the Mesta Machine 
Co., is coming back to Tech next 
year to complete his course.
The various clubs of the Industries 
School, including the Tech Mechanics 
Club, The Graphica, The Building 
Construction Club, The Avo Club and 
The Teachers’ Club will hold an in­
formal inter-club dance tomorrow 
evening, May 25th in Carnegie Union. 
Admission, however, will not be re­
stricted to the club members only, but 
students from all of the schools are 
invited. Extensive preparations are 
being made for the affair and if you 
come you will be sure of having a 
good time. Nirella’s orchestra will 
furnish the music. The assessment 
is $1.00 per couple.
Jerry Lawlor, Foundry Special, has 
just recovered from an attack of pneu­
monia, which has incapacitated him 
for the past few weeks.
He will return next year and com­
plete the course.
Tech Mechanics nine defeated the 
Building Construction team last Wed­
nesday, to the tune of 10 to 5.
The batteries were: Snyder and
Vizthum. Moon pulled off some sen­
sational fielding. The Tech Mechan­
ics nine looks like a world beater.
INDUSTRIES PLEBES TO HAVE 
BANQUET*
Elaborate arrangements are being 
made by the Plebes of the Industries 
School for their banquet, which will 
take place on Saturday evening, May 
27th at the Seventh Avenue Hotel. 
The heads of the various departments 
will be present and an effort will be 
made to have every man in the class 
on hand. An excellent program is 
being planned, which will include en­
tertainment, music, and speaking.
There have been sounds of unusual 
activity coming from the Machine 
and Forge shops, where during the 
past week, the Science men have been 
engaged in increasing their technical 
knowledge.

This holds true of the Mikado dance, 
for more tickets have been disposed 
of for this affair than the manage­
ment of the Choral Club had wished 
to sell, hoping to limit the number 
present in the Union to fifty couples.
Fortunately for the General Stu­
dent body the Choral Club, and all 
friends of Tech a third performance 
of the Mikado has been arranged to 
take the place of the school pageant 
which was held last year as the even­

ALUMNI RING ORDERS SENT IN
Bids Go To Auld and Heeren for 
Degree Courses.
Some time ago there appeared in 
the Tartan an announcement of the 
results of the competition for the 
best design of an Alumni ring. Two 
prizes of five and three dollars were 
awarded to the winners. Miss But- 
terwirth of Design School won the 1st 
prize almost unanimously, while Miss 
Meyn’s design was second. These de­
signs were voted on by representa­
tives of the various degree courses in 
all four schools. After being voted 
upon by the entire Senior class, bids 
were called for. Design School Sen­
iors awarded their contract to Auld 
Co., while Heeren Bros, received the 
contract for the remainder of the 
rings. With these twTo firms practi­
cally in competition with each other, 
some excellent results are expected. 
The design consists of a rectangle 
supported by a thistle background. 
The rectangle bears a block C. I. T. 
and the class numerals.
The idea in selecting a permanent 
design for a ring is to do away with 
the old practice of each class picking 
out a different ring. From now on 
the ring will be the same from year 
to year excepting the required change 
in numerals. This will do away 
with unnecessary trouble and give the 
Tech alumnus some uniform insignia 
which has long been a great need. 
The ring can be worn only by gradu­
ates of the various degree courses.
TECH DOWNS W. & J.
Continued from Page 1 
on a hit by Mason.
W. & J. got three hits in the sixth 
which netted them but their first run. 
Stewart singled and died stealing. 
Zehfuss to Doherty. Bixler also sin­
gled and Heyman advanced him 
with a sacrifice. Stobbs got in front 
of one of “Pick’s” spitters and limp­
ed to first. Leydic singled, scoring 
Bixler, Stobbs going to third. With 
the count three and two on Artman, 
Zehfuss made a nice catch of a foul 
tip for the third strike, retiring the 
side. W. & J. hit far and frequently 
in their innings, and so our boys 
came back stronger than ever, in the 
last half. Lundell drew a base on 
balls and stole second. Molner struck 
at three wide ones. Hines lined one 
right over second base and Lundell 
went to third. On the next ball, 
“Pick” went down, but Taggert threw 
to Moser and the runner was out 
Lundell was held at third on this 
play, but scored later on a passed 
ball. Zehfuss was passed intention­
ally, as he had three hits to his credit, 
and Cosgrove had been an easy out 
each time. Zehfuss stole second, and 
scored when Ray doubled to left field, 
the longest hit of the afternoon.
In the seventh, both sides scored 
a run on two hits. Taggert opened 
for W. & J. with a single. R. Stew­
art lined to Yeager, who made a pret­
ty try for a double play at first, but 
the throw pulled Mason off the bag. 
Taggart died stealing. With two out, 
Moser singled and scored when Doh­
erty threw S. Stewart’s grounder into 
the stands trying to catch “Mose” at
second.
“Doc” came back and led off 
with a single, stole second on 
"Yeags” hit. On the throw-in, Yea­
ger ran past second and was caught. 
Smith was hit by a pitched ball, but 
the next two men were easy.
Heyman started the eighth by reach­
ing first when Doherty threw wild. 
Wean struck out Stobbs. Leydic hit 
to “Smitty” and Heyman was forced 
at second. One of Wean’s slow balls 
got away from Zehfuss and Leydic 
went all the way to third. Artman 
drew four. Taggert dropped a hit in 
left center and Leydic counted. Me- 
Creight batted for Stewart and scored 
Artman with a single. Moser struck 
out.
McCreight took up the pitching for 
W. & J. and struck out two men in 
the eighth.
After Stewart had rlied out in the 
ninth, Bixler got a hit, but it was only 
a momentary sign of life, for the next 
two were easy.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING 
SOCIETY COMPLETES 
PLANS.
Mr. Fred W. Winter to be Present.
All details for the big annual Dutch 
Lunch and Social of the Carnegie Me­
chanical Engineering Society, to be 
held Saturday evening, June 3rd, at 
the German Club, are about com­
pleted. A rousing good time is in 
store for everyone who attends.
To the forty-three plebes, who have 
chosen the Mechanical Engineering 
Course, this meeting becomes im­
perative. Officers for the coming 
school term, 1916-17, will be elected. 
To the present plebes this means 
much; since they become eligible for 
membership at the beginning of their 
Sophomore year.
A number of the large manufac­
turing concerns in the Pittsburgh dis­
trict have offered us such articles as 
hand books, slide-rules, oil stones, 
steel tapes, etc., etc., to distribute as 
souvenirs ¡at tthis meeting. These 
will be given as favors a* the meet­
ing.
Mr. Fred M. Winter, the brilliant 
patent attorney, who gave such an 
able address before the Engineer’s 
Society of Western Pennsylvania re­
cently, will be present to tell us about 
some of the things concerning pat­
ents, which the average young engin­
eer does not know.
WITH THE PLEBES IN THE 
SHOPS.
real Tech man. Starting on Thurs­
day, the real shop work set in and 
proved quite interesting, although 
quite warm for twisting material and 
making points. The machine shop
has been the least boresome, although 
there has been a large amount of 
notes to be made. The course cov­
ers the various materials and strength, 
fastners, drills, lathes, etc. Plumbing 
shop starts today.
As a whole, the general opinion of 
the class is that the shops give much 
that is of practical value and of in­
terest, but with the approach of ex­
aminations and the assignment of 
the notes of other work, in addition 
to the writing of the notes, they con­
sider their burden too heavy for this 
time of year.

How the Science Plebes Like Shop 
Work.
Having already spent a week in the 
shops, the Science Plebes by this time 
are fairly well accustomed to the me­
thods used in the shops. On the first 
day, the Forge and Machine Shop 
work consisted chiefly of lectures and 
along with them the announcement 
that about two hours a night should 
be spent in writing up notes. This 
with the eighteen hours of academic 
work which the Plebes are obliged to 
perform before exam time was quite 
a blow to Plebe spirits. The work- 
in the Brick Shop was different from 
that in the two former named 
Shops. At the start, every Plebe was 
put to work laying bricks. Although 
harder physically, the general opinion 
is that this work has been quite in­
teresting. Thus far straight walls, 
fireplaces and arches have been built. 
At the end of the day the bricks have 
to be cleaned of cement and stacked, 
all of this being done in true West­
ern Penitentiary form. Needless to 
say, a few feel quite at home while 
thus occupied.
On the first day of Forge Shop the 
eight-hour lecture proved quite a stun­
ner. One Plebe stated that after he 
got through, he would be fit to be a
Enjoyable Time in Science Club 
Room. Faculty Invited.
On Monday, May 15th, the Sopho­
more Electricals gave a smoker in the 
Science Club Room, to which all of 
the instructors of the class were in­
vited. It was a strictly informal af­
fair and all of the entertainment was 
supplied by members of the class 
itself except that furnished when the 
members of the faculty started to tell 
stories.
Al. Hanks outdid himself when he 
was awarded the decision over “Tubs" 
Jones in a three-round bout for the 
bantam weight championship of Soho. 
In a wrestling match, Joe Pannabaker 
succeeded in getting two successive 
falls on Montana Wolf, but by no 
means without a struggle. Another 
feature of the entertainment was the 
Tech bull fight between Jack Gang- 
ler and Bill Eames. Music was sup­
plied throughout the evening by 
Dutch Konnerth’s orchestra, assisted 
by Spy Mowry.
The entertainment was markedly 
successful, and did not fail to call 
forth the praise of all those present, 
particularly after the “Groceries” had 
been brought out.

COMMENCEMENT EVENTS
Continued from Page 1 
has thus far arranged for special 
music by the Symphony Orchestra 
and the Choral Club, both of which 
will be seated on the platform.
The committee in charge is not yet 
able to give out the name of the 
speaker of the day, but it can be 
stated that endeavors are being made, 
with every prospect of success, to se­
cure one of the most prominent men 
in official life at Washington to speak 
at these exercises.
The customary award of diplomas 
will follow the address. The students 
of the Design School are busy at work 
on a special cover for the program, 
which will be an unique feature of 
this Commencement.
As has now become customary at 
“Tech,” the informal Commencement 
Ball will be held in the evening of 
Commencement Day in the halls 
and foyer of the Design School and 
will be open to faculty, alumni, the 
Seniors and their friends. The or­
chestra will be announced later. The 
ball committee is Dr. Walter V. Bing­
ham, chairman, Miss Bennett, Mrs. 
Philput, Messrs. McCorkle and Hart-
TENNIS TEAM OPENS SEASON.
Davis and Meredith Win Sweaters in

4-2. Captain Davis and Meredith both 
won in singles and doubles, which as­
sures each man of his “C” sweater. 
In their doubles match, they defeated 
Ransom and Robinson, both star play­

Allegheny came here, ably repre­
sented by John and Homer Castle, 
Cox and Doane, and this quartette 
made a clean sweep of the matches. 
Beatty put up his usual consistent 
game and forced Homer Castle to 
go three sets, winning the second one
6-0. Murphy played his first match 
for Tech, and although he lost to 
Doane, he made a good impression 
upon those who witnessed this game.

with the Castle brothers in the dou­
bles, and forced the first set to 11-9. 
Harwood played with Beatty against 
Cox and Doane, and carried both sets

SONS COMPANY
Zeta Lambda Epsilon’s Annual 
Canoe Outing, their chief social func­
tion of the year, was consummated 
up the Allegheny on fourteen-mile 
island just beneath the Bessemer 
bridge last Saturday, under the smil­
ing skies and soft breezes Dame For­
tune bestowed.
For the first time in the history of 
the fraternity an all-day picnic with 
two meals planned and served en­
tirely by the men, was arranged; but 
the hours between 9:18 A. M. when 
the party left East Liberty for 
Black’s Run in a private car, and 11:15 
P. M. when they were again deposited 
at East Liberty passed so swiftly that 
a permanent custom for an all-day 
event was probably established.
Seventeen canoes and four row­
boats made up the flotilla, and all 
during the day the river ’round the 
island was dotted with exploring ca­
noeists. A program of athletic and 
aquating events for both men and 
girls took up the early part of the 
afternoon; and then, after supper was 
served and the fifty-foot paper table 
was cleaned from the landscape, a 
rousing blaze made the center of a 
real camp fire circle at which one told 
stories, yelled, and sang songs to the 
accompaniment of mandolins and gui­
tars.
The last event of the day is the 
one which will be remembered long­
est by the eighty-two people present. 
About 8:30 P. M. all the canoes and 
boats, lighted at each end with two 
Japanese lanterns, formed into a com­
pact raft sixty feet wide, held together 
by the girls of one canoe holding on 
to the adjacent ones. Then with 
school, fraternity, and other yells and 
songs the entire mass ablaze with lan­
terns, floated the two miles down 
river to the Oakmont Boat Club, 
where the party disembarked, tired 
but happy.
All the girls were given small ster­
ling bar pins, oxidized finish, with the 
fraternity letters raised on their sur­
face. Professor and Mrs. Stanton, 
with Dr. and Mrs. Grondahl, chaper­
oned. The girls present from a dis­
tance were the Misses Bossart, Brun, 
Jenkins, and Giles, and the girls from 
Pittsburgh were the Misses Dickey, 
Rich, Laud, Fleming, Marshall, Rey­
nolds, McFarlin, Hurst, Seaman, 
Dette, Mamaux, McNeil, Wirth, Mary 
Knapp, Pond, Vandermiller, Mockett, 
Madera, Strathearn, Stevenson, Dunn, 
Wakefield, Shanahan, Mildred Knapp, 
Schropp, Nuttal, Young, Wallace, 
Lingenfelser, Corswirt, Jacobs, Bur- 
good, and Stark.
ATHLETIC TEAMS HAVE BUSY 
WEEK AHEAD.
During the following week our ath­
letes will appear before the public on 
no less than eight occasions, and it 
will be a race between the three 
branches of sport t^ make the best 
showing.
The track team will compete with 
Bethany in a dual meet at the Schen- 
ley Oval next Saturday in conjunction 
with the Interscholastic representa­
tives who will also assemble to set­
tle the question of school supremacy.
The baseball team plays Pitt this 
afternoon and considering the im­
provement that the team has shown 
during the past week, they deserve 
the support of the entire student 
body. On Memorial Day they jour­
ney to Grove City and play two 
games that afternoon. Ray Cosgrove 
beat them when they played here and 
he will probably be given an oppor­
tunity, to repeat, a week from today. 
Western Reserve will be our oppon­
ents on our field, and judging from 
the past record, the game is sure to 
be hotly contested.
The tennis team leaves on a two- 
day trip to play Grove City and Al­
legheny on May 26 and 27. The team 
has made a good showing thus far, 
and should defeat the Grove City 
boys, but the outcome of the Alle­
gheny match is doubtful, as they beat 
us on our courts last Saturday. On 
Memorial Day, the Grove City four 
will play us a return match here, and 
the result will depend entirely on the 
showing of the two teams on May 
26.
