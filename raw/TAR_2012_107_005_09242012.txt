Carnegie Mellon’s Soft-
ware Engineering Institute 
(SEI) is now expanding into 
Bakery Square in East Lib-
erty. The university spin-off 
research center has recently 
leased 38,000 square feet of 
space from a now LEED-cer-
ti?ed old Nabisco Bakery in 
Bakery Square.
Google, the University of 
Pittsburgh Department of 
Rehabilitation Science and 
Technology, the UPMC Tech-
nology Development Center, 
and the VA Human Engineer-
ing Research Laboratories also 
reside in of?ce complexes in 
the Bakery Square center. The 
SEI’s expansion will be housed 
on the ?rst ?oor.
The lease was made by 
Walnut Capital Partners, and 
was of?cially announced to 
the public Sept. 12.
Paul Nielsen, director and 
CEO of the SEI, said in an 
email, “We’re over capacity in 
our Oakland of?ces and need 
more space due to growth in 
staf?ng. Bakery Square of-
fered the best value and is 
still relatively close to campus 
compared to other of?ce space 
available in the Pittsburgh 
area.”
Nielsen went on to em-
phasize that the SEI was “not 
‘moving’ to Bakery Square, but 
expanding to there.” He said, 
“We will still remain in our ex-
isting Oakland sites — 4500 
Fifth Ave., the CIC building, 
Sterling Plaza and the RAND 
building.”
As recorded in the SEI’s of-
?cial press release, Pittsburgh 
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said, 
“I am thrilled to welcome SEI 
to Bakery Square — a develop-
ment that has been essential 
to the recent transformation 
of Pittsburgh’s East End. The 
announcement that Bakery 
Square is now 100 percent 
leased is an exciting and sig-
ni?cant milestone for the proj-
ect’s many dedicated stake-
holders, especially Walnut 
Capital and RCG Longview 
Fund. The anticipation now 
rises for Bakery Square 2.0, 
which will provide even more 
of?ce space, create more jobs, 
and grow our thriving high-
tech innovation economy.”
The SEI describes itself on 
its website as a “a federally 
funded research and devel-
opment center sponsored by 
the Department of Defense,” 
and works “closely with de-
fense and government orga-
nizations, industry, and aca-
demia to continually improve 
software-intensive systems. 
Its core purpose is to help or-
ganizations to improve their 
software engineering capabili-
ties and to develop or acquire 
the right software, defect free, 
within budget and on time, ev-
ery time.”
The SEI’s website also ex-
plains that the institute was 
founded in 1984 at Carnegie 
Mellon by the Department of 
Defense, and currently has 
over 500 employees, with of-
?ces in Los Angeles; Arlington, 
Va.;  and Frankfurt, Germany.
The SEI’s government con-
tract was recently extended 
through June 2015 for $584 
million, according to a previ-
ous SEI press release.
“Expansions space was 
necessary because the staff we 
had in current facilities were 
getting overcrowded,” said 
Richard Lynch, the public rela-
tions manager for the SEI.
Lynch said that Bakery 
Square was chosen as a loca-
tion “for a combination of rea-
sons: We needed more space 
immediately, and that space is 
somewhat convenient to CMU 
and other SEI locations.”
According to Lynch, ?-
nance and business support 
services were the main depart-
ments being moved to Bak-
ery Square. Lynch said that 
the move “frees up a certain 
amount of space in the main 
SEI building to facilitate more 
research staff.”
New noise policy aims to quiet campus
JACKSON LANE
Senior Staffwriter
The campus noise policy 
has been revised to limit the 
amount of noise coming from 
student organization activi-
ties on the Cut. The revisions 
were announced to leaders of 
Greek and student organiza-
tions in an email from Direc-
tor of Student Activities Eliza-
beth Vaughan and Associate 
Director of Student Life for 
Upperclass and Greek Hous-
es Lucas Christain. The new 
policy is also available online 
in Carnegie Mellon’s Student 
Handbook, The Word.
The main change is the 
clari?cation that the noise 
policy applies to both indoor 
and outdoor activities. In 
particular, the new policy is 
meant to target activities on 
the Cut.
“We received a lot of feed-
back from faculty, staff, and 
students saying that we need 
to preserve some periods for 
studying and being in class,” 
Christain said. “People were 
saying how they had to close 
windows in class because 
there was music coming from 
the Cut or from another part 
of campus.”
According to Christain, 
in the majority of the com-
plaints, the noise was coming 
from student organizations, 
which is why he and Vaughan 
made a special announcement 
to student organization lead-
ers. “It was important that 
student organizations were 
aware of this policy because 
a lot of their activities include 
tabling, hooking up speakers, 
or doing something on cam-
pus outside,” Christain said.
Both the current noise 
policy and the previous ver-
sion, released in 1998, begin 
by specifying hours when cer-
tain types of noise are permis-
sible, and both versions then 
go on to say that “excessive 
noise that results in a reason-
able complaint from residents 
within or beyond the campus” 
is never permitted.
However, when specify-
ing the hours, the 1998 ver-
sion de?nes the type of noise 
restricted as “indoor activity 
that can be heard outside a 
university building.” The cur-
rent revision expands this 
de?nition to include both 
indoor and outdoor noises, 
such as those from activities 
happening on the Cut. Spe-
ci?cally, the 2012 revision 
uses the umbrella phrase, 
“Activity occurring on Carn-
egie Mellon-owned or man-
aged property that disrupts 
the normal course of business 
or is otherwise disruptive to 
the university or surrounding 
communities.”
Although one could argue 
that the 1998 version would 
still classify loud activity on 
the Cut as “excessive noise 
that results in a reasonable 
complaint,” the de?nition is 
vague and doesn’t acknowl-
edge how outside activity, like 
the indoor activity referenced, 
can be “excessive” during cer-
tain times of the day while 
permissible at other times.
In short, the 2012 version 
clari?es what type of noise is 
allowed at what time. “The 
main difference was that 
there was more ambiguity in 
the previous version,” said

Man makes poetry of cave art
NOËL UM
Junior Staffwriter
Melding the realms of 
archaeology and poetry, 
Clayton Eshleman — Amer-
ican poet, translator, and 
editor — spoke about his 
experiences discovering an-
cient cave art in Southern 
France to an audience in 
Porter Hall last Thursday.
The lecture drew on Es-
hleman’s recent book of po-
etry, Juniper Fuse: Upper Pa-
leolithic Imagination & the 
Construction of the Under-
world. Eshleman cited the 
wicks made from juniper 
branches that he found dur-
ing his cave excursions as 
the source of the book’s ti-
tle. The symbolic title serves 
as a snippet of his book’s 
content, which draws heav-
ily on Eshleman’s ?ndings 
of Cro-Magnon rock art and 
its metaphorical interpreta-
tion.
An excerpt from Juni-
per Fuse reads, “The way a 
cave might leak perfume.... 
In the Cro-Magnons went, 
along its wet, hide walls 
as if a ?ower, way in, drew 
their leggy, tense traumatic 
bodies, spidering over bot-
tomless hunches, groping 
toward Persephone’s fate.”
Throughout his presen-
tation, Eshleman recreated 
his encounters with the 
cave art that inspired the 
poetry in his book. He pro-
jected slides of images from 
the art that in?uenced his 
writing in order to talk in 
detail about each piece and 
its symbolic or metaphori-
cal signi?cance.
Many images showed an 
advanced degree of intel-
lectual development within 
the Cro-Magnons. One im-
age of a horse head aligned 
with the outline of a vulva, 
Eshleman said, served as a 
metaphorical connection 
between “head power and 
vulva power.”
Some pieces of art that 
Eshleman displayed were 
painted with manganese 
or okra, in such detail that 
he compared to the work of 
artist Pablo Picasso.

Faculty members, stu-
dents, and alumni of the 
English department came 
together to celebrate the 
25th anniversary of the 
university’s literary and cul-
tural studies program last 
Thursday and Friday. Ac-
cording to English professor 
Kathy Newman, who orga-
nized the celebration, the 
program has produced over 
300 alumni with master’s 
degrees or doctorates in lit-
erary and cultural studies 
since its inception in 1986.
The events kicked off 
Thursday with a short ?lm 
titled “Tributaries: 25 Years 
of Literary and Cultural 
Studies at Carnegie Mellon 
University.” Created by doc-
toral candidates David Hae-
selin and Sheila Liming, the 
documentary focused on 
the history of literary and 
cultural studies, both as a 
broader academic ?eld and, 
more speci?cally, at Carn-
egie Mellon in the past 25 
years. The ?lm also looked 
at the prospective future 
of the literary and cultural 
studies program. “The ?lm 
tries to offer a conversation 
about where we have come 
from and where we are go-
ing,” Liming said.
“It’s a great way to learn 
something about [liter-
ary and cultural studies],” 
Bridget Powers, a ?rst-year 
graduate student in the pro-
gram, said of the ?lm. “It’s 
de?nitely an umbrella term,

A team of Carnegie Mel-
lon researchers, led by eco-
nomics and public policy 
professor Robert Strauss and 
social and decision science 
professor Afeworki Paulos, 
has launched a comprehen-
sive online compilation of 
literature on natural gas ex-
traction in the Marcellus and 
Utica shales.
“Not surprisingly, there 
has been scant investigation 
of impacts of natural gas ex-
traction by hydraulic fractur-
ing in areas such as popula-
tion change, transportation 
infrastructure, housing pat-
terns, income or poverty and 
social services usage. There is 
very little knowledge about 
how this important economic 
driver is affecting so many 
aspects of our communities. 
The majority of the literature 
on this activity deals with 
economic, environmental, or 
public health impacts. And 
even these impacts are still 
under investigation,” Strauss 
said in a university press re-
lease.
The aim of the project is 
to allow policymakers to un-
derstand the body of research 
on natural gas extraction. 
The project catalogues over 
1,200 academic articles, re-
ports from think tanks, gov-
ernment documents, maps, 
and research guides. It can 
be searched by keyword or 
browsed by category.
The team compiled the 
literature with a grant from 
the Chrostwaite Institute, the 
nonpro?t arm of the Penn-
sylvania State Association of 
Boroughs.

Carnegie Mellon’s depart-
ment of modern languages 
has partnered with the Latin 
American Cultural Union to 
present the Latinos In/On 
Film Festival 2012, in honor 
of Hispanic Heritage Month. 
The festival will show ?ve 
?lms over the course of four 
weeks. It started last week 
and will end Oct. 12. The aim 
of the festival is to showcase 
the accomplishments of La-
tino  writers and ?lmmakers 
and the contributions of the 
Latino population to Ameri-
can culture.
“Showing this particular 
group of ?lms during His-
panic Heritage Month is not 
just to acknowledge recent 
Spanish-speaking immi-
grants to the U.S., but pri-
marily to acknowledge the 
historical presence of Latinos 
here, since Spanish colonial 
days and on into the 19th and 
early- to mid-20th century 
and beyond,” Hispanic stud-
ies associate professor Kenya 
Dworkin said in a university 
press release. “The Latino 
presence here is as much U.S. 
history as it is about more re-
cent immigrants and exiles. 
These ?ve ?lms are a modest 
attempt at offering a glimpse 
of that vast experience as 
written and portrayed by U.S. 
Latinos.”
The ?rst ?lm, ...y no se lo 
tragó la tierra, was shown 
last Thursday. The remaining 
four ?lms are El Súper, which 
will be shown this Wednes-
day; La guagua aérea, which 
will be shown Oct. 3; Nueba 
Yol, which will be shown Oct. 
6; and A Day Without a Mexi-
can, which will be shown Oct. 
12. A discussion will follow 
each ?lm.

cave paintings; Eshleman 
said that the hybrid animal 
was “the engine of anima dis-
play.”
According to Eshleman, 
these imaginative ?gures 
in?uenced his detail-heavy 
prose-poetry in Juniper Fuse.
Some students who en-
joyed Eshleman’s presenta-
tion nevertheless felt unsatis-
?ed with its emphasis on the 
discovery of cave art, rather 
than on the poetic process.
Sophie Zucker, a ?rst-
year science and humanities 
scholar, said, “I didn’t feel 
like Eshleman was necessar-
ily an expert on archaeology, 
and I wish I saw more of the 
writing aspect of his work 
rather than the facts that he 
had gathered.”
Eshleman delivered his 
lecture as part of the Vic-
tor M. Bearg Speaker Series 
sponsored by the Science 
and Humanities Scholars 
program, which is headed by 
William Alba.
Alba said, “What [Eshle-
man] is doing is a nice coun-
terpoint to what we often do 
at CMU. We’re so involved in 
innovation and that requires 
us to be at the edge of today 
and tomorrow, whereas what 
he’s doing is looking at hu-
manity and stretching it back 
to the distant past.”
In his opening remarks, 
Alba said, “With the sensitiv-
ity and insensibility of a poet, 
[Eshleman] translates his ex-
periences so that we might 
better understand what he 
encountered there.”
Eshleman is a Professor 
Emeritus at Eastern Michigan 
University and author of over 
40 books, including books of 
poetry and translations.
POET, from A1
where a lot of people think 
they know what it means, but 
they don’t.”
The advent of cultural 
studies came in the mid-20th 
century, when the term was 
coined at the Birmingham 
Centre for Contemporary Cul-
ture Studies, Newman said. 
She described it as “studying 
literature and other forms of 
culture in the historical con-
text in which that culture is 
produced ... [and] how and 
why people make culture.”
Many students and profes-
sors who viewed the ?lm said 
that Carnegie Mellon’s pro-
gram is unique in its highly 
interdisciplinary nature, and 
particularly in its emphasis on 
literature. “It’s really impor-
tant at Carnegie Mellon that 
we remember the title of the 
department as ‘literary and 
cultural studies’.... This ?lm 
is part of work to preserve the 
‘and,’ ” Haeselin said.
Haeselin and Liming also 
emphasized the wide-ranging 
uses of a degree in literary and 
cultural studies; Liming called 
the program a “springboard 
for thinking about other cul-
tural forms.”
After the ?lm, the cel-
ebration moved to Danforth 
Lounge in the University Cen-
ter, where seven of the pro-
gram’s alumni — Carl Daven-
port, Rachel Delphia, Michael 
Scotto, Regina Anderson, Da-
vid Pass, Matt Freeman, and 
Luke Niebler — talked about 
their experiences applying lit-
erary and cultural studies out-
side of the academic world.
The panelists have used 
their degrees in diverse ways. 
Delphia, for example, is the 
assistant curator of decorative 
arts at the Carnegie Museum 
of Art, while Scotto has just 
released a version of his book 
Be a Buddy, Not a Bully for the 
iPad.
The celebration concluded 
Friday evening with a keynote 
address by Larry Grossberg, 
professor of communication 
at the University of North Car-
olina, Chapel Hill.
ANNIVERSARY, from A1
and statistics and decision 
science double major who 
helped draft the new policy. 
“These revisions are helpful 
insomuch as they let student 
leaders know what policies 
are actually in place.”
There are also changes to 
the hours when “disruptive 
noise” is permitted during 
both weekends and weekdays. 
On Monday through Thurs-
day, such noise is only allowed 
between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 
p.m., whereas in the 1998 ver-
sion of the policy, noise was 
permitted from 4:30 p.m. to 
7 p.m. On Fridays, the hours 
are between 4:30 p.m. and 10 
p.m., versus 4:30 p.m. to mid-
night in the 1998 version.
“We want to acknowledge 
that the university should 
have regular operating hours 
where the focus should pri-
marily be studying and being 
in class,” Christain explained. 
“There’s a policy that under-
graduate class[es] aren’t held, 
or shouldn’t be held, between 
4:30 and 6:30, so it’s a free 
period of time that we can set 
aside for student activities.”
The 2012 policy also ac-
knowledges that “a vibrant 
campus culture ... will neces-
sarily involve some noise asso-
ciated with campus activities.”
“We don’t want to squelch 
student life,” Christain said.
The new revisions also ex-
pand the permissible noise 
hours during the weekend. 
In the 1998 version of the 
noise policy, the hours were 
between 4:30 p.m. and mid-
night, while the current revi-
sion expands this period from 
7 a.m. and 10 p.m.
Although the 2012 revi-
sions might restrict certain 
student organization activi-
ties, Weiner doesn’t think the 
policy will have much of an 
impact on campus. “Students 
are still allowed to play music 
and make noise on the Cut, 
but they should do so at a rea-
sonable volume. At the end of 
the day, I don’t think the core 
culture of our university will 
change because people ta-
bling have to turn down their 
speakers,” Weiner said.
Senior business adminis-
tration major Alex Price, the 
general manager of WRCT, 
said he doesn’t anticipate the 
radio station being affected. 
“WRCT has always done its 
best to not disrupt classes and 
this new policy will not change 
any [of] our activities on the 
Cut,” he said in an email. 
“We want people to enjoy our 
music, not get an ear full of 
noise. Regardless of any ‘noise 
policy,’ WRCT always plays its 
music at an appropriate level 
while out on the Cut.”
According to Price, WRCT 
has known about the policy 
change since August. 
“My adviser for WRCT 
told me about it,” Price said. 
“He said that if we’re playing 
music where we normally do, 
and somebody’s walking by 
the UC, they shouldn’t need 
to raise their voices to hear 
themselves in that conversa-
tion. Then I saw the email and 
thought, ‘It’s really not a big 
deal.’ ”

Stand-off ends peacefully
MADELYN GLYMOUR
News Editor
A local hostage situation 
ended peacefully on Friday 
when 22-year-old Klein Thax-
ton surrendered to police.
At approximately 8 a.m. 
on Friday morning, Thaxton 
entered the 16th ?oor of 3 
Gateway Center in Downtown 
and took Charles Breitsman 
of CW Breitsman Associates, 
which organizes pension and 
bene?t plans for other com-
panies, hostage at knifepoint. 
Throughout the ensuing six-
hour stand-off, Thaxton regu-
larly updated his Facebook.
Thaxton, who pled guilty 
in January to robbery, receiv-
ing stolen property, simple as-
sault, and reckless endanger-
ment, wrote, “i cant take it no 
more im done bro,” and “this 
life im livn rite now i dnt want 
anymore ive lost everything 
and i aint gettn it back,” on his 
Facebook account, according 
to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
Police shut down Thaxton’s 
Facebook account because 
it was distracting him from 
their attempts to negotiate.
As one of his demands, 
Thaxton asked to speak to 
his former girlfriend. Police 
granted the request. Negotia-
tions were eventually success-
ful. Thaxton surrendered to 
police at about 2 p.m.
Police have not yet re-
vealed a motive for Thax-
ton’s actions. CNN reported 
that Pittsburgh Police Chief 
Nathan Harper said that po-
lice believe Thaxton targeted 
Breitsman speci?cally, but 
according to The New York 
Times, Harper said that Thax-
ton did not know Breitsman.
Breitsman was unharmed. 
According to The New York 
Times and CNN, Thaxton has 
been charged with aggravat-
ed assault, kidnapping, and 
terrorist threats.

Last Friday, Carnegie Mel-
lon unveiled its ?rst of?cial 
preview of the university’s 
newest addition: the Wilton E. 
Scott Institute for Energy In-
novation.
The campus-wide event 
— titled “From Technology 
to Policy: Energy Research 
at Carnegie Mellon” — had 
speakers to present and dis-
cuss Carnegie Mellon’s current 
role in the energy innovation 
of and plans for the Scott Insti-
tute. Speakers included Presi-
dent Jared Cohon; Granger 
Morgan and Andrew Gellman, 
the new Scott Institute’s di-
rector and associate direc-
tor, respectively; and various 
Carnegie Mellon researchers 
who are already tackling the 
energy problem.
Morgan described how 
the new energy institute — 
housed in the Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology but still a 
university-wide collaboration 
— will make Carnegie Mellon 
a “go-to” place in energy-re-
lated research and education, 
use resources to coordinate 
and promote synergy between 
colleges, and increase the uni-
versity’s visibility.
The vision for the Scott 
Institute is to create a part-
nership of disciplines that act 
toward a better energy en-
vironment for the common 
good.
“Energy decisions unfold in 
critical, regulatory, environ-
mental, and behavioral con-
text, and we need economic, 
organizational, and policy 
solutions as much as we need 
new technology,” Cohon said. 
“This is an interdisciplinary 
challenge of the ?rst order, 
and Carnegie Mellon simply 
does this cross-collaboration 
better than any other institu-
tion that I know.”
However, the speakers 
made clear that there are cer-
tain things the institute will 
not do.
Namely, Morgan said that 
the institute will not divert 
corporate membership from 
existing centers, take on re-
search that others on campus 
are already doing, or dictate 
what others do and where 
external support goes on cam-
pus. It will be a collaborative 
center for researchers and an 
open place for outsiders and 
non-experts to learn about en-
ergy research.
Speaking at the energy 
symposium were 11 faculty 
members, many of whom are 
from or involved with Carn-
egie Mellon’s engineering 
and public policy department, 
ready to discuss their research 
and ?ndings in the energy in-
novation front.
Topics ranged from, “Can 
low-cost batteries help us to 
use more renewables and build 
fewer transmission lines?” to 
“How will human behavior af-
fect energy futures?” and “Are 
federal policies targeting the 
right plug-in vehicle?” Other 
topics represented national 
questions, like the validity of 
clean coal, and local issues, 
such as the advancement of 
local transportation.
Students will see the many 
graduate programs coming 
out of the Scott Institute and 
the new courses available to 
undergraduate students as 
direct impacts. The facility 
will also house research labs, 
including a state-of-the-art 
nanotechnology fabrication 
lab, and it will also serve as the 
home of the biomedical engi-
neering department.
“We’re in position to make 
an impact on such a greatly 
important problem as this,” 
Cohon said. “It’s an opportu-
nity that goes beyond just that 
— I view it as an obligation for 
Carnegie Mellon.”
The institute will be located 
in the soon-to-be-constructed 
Sherman and Joyce Bowie 
Scott Hall, a 100,000-square-
foot building located among 
Hamerschlag, Wean, and Rob-
erts Halls. This new building 
is named after Mr. and Mrs. 
Scott, two alumni whose do-
nations helped fund the insti-
tute.
The Sherman and Joyce 
Bowie Scott Hall is slated to 
open in 2015.

The successful landing 
of NASA’s Curiosity rover on 
Mars has rekindled Amer-
ica’s desire to explore the 
red planet. President Barack 
Obama has said that he would 
like to see the success of a 
manned space exploration 
to Mars by 2030. But before 
NASA can successfully con-
duct a mission to this unex-
plored realm, it must ?rst be 
able to ensure the health of its 
astronauts during the eight-
month journey.
A team of biomedical re-
searchers at Carnegie Mellon 
and the University of Louis-
ville have joined this effort. 
They are developing a dome-
shaped containment unit, 
called an Aqueous Immersion 
Surgical System (AISS), that 
makes performing surgeries 
in the zero-gravity conditions 
of outer space a reality.
The project stems from an 
idea proposed by James Bur-
gess, a neurosurgeon at Al-
legheny General Hospital who 
wanted to develop a tool that 
would prevent blood from 
?lling a surgical cavity and 
blocking a surgeon’s view. 
Carnegie Mellon biomedical 
engineering professor James 
Antaki, with the help of Ph.D. 
student Jennifer Hayden, re-
?ned a system to surround the 
surgical wound with a water-
tight dome and utilize water 
pressure to control bleeding.
The surgical dome is 
sealed to the skin around the 
injury to prevent contamina-
tion. Multiple holes are on the 
dome’s surface: One allows 
entry of pressure-controlled 
water into the surgical area, 
while another holds a suction 
to prevent waste from ?lling 
the cavity. The dome’s trans-
parency and its access port for 
surgical tools allow surgeons 
to operate more easily.
“On top of the excitement 
that their prototype could be 
utilized in space exploration, 
it is very rewarding knowing 
their tool could immensely 
bene?t trauma patients dur-
ing surgery on the ground,” 
Hayden said.
The next step for the team 
is to test the device in condi-
tions similar to those in outer 
space. Another member of 
the project’s team, University 
of Louisville surgery and bio-
medical engineering profes-
sor George Pantalos, collabo-
rated with NASA to conduct 
tests in NASA’s C-9 aircraft, 
which travels in parabolic 
arcs to simulate zero-gravity 
conditions.
While in ?ight, the cham-
ber will allow the team to 
test two different functions of 
the device: “The watertight 
chamber will contain hol-
low tubes ?lled with a blood 
substitute that simulate the 
network of blood vessels,” 
Hayden explained. “After cut-
ting the tubes similar to how 
blood vessels would be cut 
during surgery, the suction 
system should replace the liq-
uid with a clear substitute to 
increase visibility.”
In addition to removing 
the blood from the chamber, 
the tool also controls pressure 
to force the vessels to collapse 
and stop the bleeding all to-
gether. “Using a pig heart 
?lled with an arti?cial ?uid, 
[they] will monitor the pres-
sure at which the bleeding is 
stopped,” Hayden said.
Gravity plays an important 
role in surgery, keeping body 
parts and blood in place dur-
ing the procedure. This can 
present a real complication in 
outer space.
“We had to design an eval-
uation station to surround the 
AISS that would physically 
attach to the plane, catching 
any leaks just in case, because 
it is very hard to clean up a 
blood substitute while ?ying 
sideways,” Hayden said.
Hollywood has devised 
its own take on a solution 
to the gravity problem with 
this summer’s blockbuster 
Prometheus, which features 
a large automated surgical 
chamber. The AISS prototype 
is one of the ?rst steps in as-
tro-biomedical engineering 
to take this big-screen idea 
and make it a reality, which 
could help ensure the health 
of astronauts on their long 
journey.
Researchers to test system that helps with astro-surgery
Rethink Robotics creates human-like robot
Rethink Robotics, a start-
up company in Boston, has 
taken arti?cial intelligence 
to the next step with the de-
velopment of the two-armed 
robot, Baxter. The robot dis-
plays human-like characteris-
tics, such as facial expressions 
and the ability to adjust to 
unexpected situations. Baxter 
was designed to be integrated 
into the workforce with hu-
mans and perform simple, 
repetitive tasks involved with 
manufacturing and assembly.
Unlike past robot models, 
Baxter has mechanisms to 
ensure that it is not a safety 
threat. For example, it can 
sense a human nearby and 
adjust itself accordingly. Re-
think Robotics hopes to sell 
such robots for an inexpen-
sive price in order to make the 
use of robots widespread.

Scientists believe to have spotted oldest galaxy
A team of astronomers at 
Johns Hopkins University dis-
covered a galaxy believed to 
be the oldest and most distant 
galaxy ever observed. It was 
detected using NASA’s Hubble 
and Spitzer Space telescopes 
and a technique known as 
cosmic magni?cation.
The observed galaxy is be-
lieved to be 13.2 billion years 
old, just a half billion years 
younger than the estimated 
age of the universe. Galax-
ies of this age are believed to 
have contributed to the “re-
ionization period,” when the 
universe began to transition 
from a total darkness to the 
galaxy we see today. Because 
of its age, the galaxy will be 
a useful tool in studying the 
early history of our universe, 
such as the rise of the ?rst 
stars and galaxies.

People with PTSD may ?nd help in ecstasy use
A research team, led by Da-
vid Nutt of Imperial College 
London in the U.K., conducted 
a study to determine the ef-
fects of the drug ecstasy on 
the brain, and whether it can 
serve as a therapeutic drug for 
post traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD). 
In the study, participants 
took ecstasy pills, had their 
brains scanned, and were told 
to report back a week later 
and describe their most posi-
tive and most negative memo-
ries, rating them by their viv-
idness. The team found that 
negative memories were less 
vivid to the participants. The 
study suggests that ecstasy 
could help reduce the shock 
individuals feel when access-
ing traumatic memories, and 
therefore help them better 
cope with PTSD.

Climate change could bring back ancient plants
In a conference in Toronto, 
Alexandre Guertin-Pasquier, 
of the University of Montre-
al’s department of geography, 
presented ?ndings show-
ing that fossilized forests in 
Northern Canada could re-
turn due to the warming of 
the Arctic. He studied a 2.6- 
to 3-million-year-old Bylot 
Island fossilized forest, which 
had been preserved over time 
by peat and permafrost.
Guertin-Pasquier and his 
team discovered pollen that 
would normally be found in 
regions where the average 
climate was 32°F, while the 
current average temperature 
of Bylot Island is 5°F. Howev-
er, his data models show that 
over time, the climate of Bylot 
Island will once again be able 
to support this type of growth, 
sprouting trees such as wil-
low, pine, and spruce.

Ecologist wonders: Are we running out of plants?
Steven Running, a forest 
ecologist at the University 
of Montana, claims that we 
may be reaching the limit 
of the world’s plant growth. 
He and his team have stud-
ied NASA satellite observa-
tions since 1982 to infer how 
plant growth has changed 
over time. The observations 
showed that plant growth has 
remained mostly unchanged, 
meaning that human efforts 
to increase plant growth will 
perhaps be ineffective.
Running claims that plant 
growth is a planetary bound-
ary, which is an underlying 
idea that there are certain 
environmental conditions 
that must be met to avoid irre-
versible damage. He suggests 
that we may be approaching 
Earth’s limit of plant growth 
and suggests monitoring it 
closely.

Behavioral characteristics of autism explained
Researchers from Carn-
egie Mellon, the University 
of Pittsburgh, and the Weiz-
mann Institute of Science in 
Israel conducted a study that 
could explain the causes of 
behavioral traits in autistic 
individuals. 
The researchers scanned 
the brains of 28 participants, 
half autistic and half not. They 
then studied the participants’ 
reactions to a series of dots 
projected at a ?xed point on a 
computer screen and a series 
of beeps. While non-autistic 
individuals showed constant 
responses, autistic individuals 
had widely varied reactions. 
The study concluded that, 
for autistic individuals, repeti-
tive behaviors may be a coping 
mechanism for these “erratic 
brain responses.”

The discovery of a potential 
tumor can be a challenging 
experience for patients and 
physicians. While the patient 
needs to understand what’s 
going on, the physician has to 
decide if the tumor needs to 
be removed immediately. This 
process is not as clear-cut as 
it seems. There are relatively 
few tools available to help a 
physician determine what ex-
act course of action should be 
followed, but researchers at 
Carnegie Mellon are about to 
help them out.
Robert Murphy, head of the 
Ray and Stephanie Lane Cen-
ter for Computational Biology, 
and Gustavo Rohde, an asso-
ciate professor with Carnegie 
Mellon’s department of bio-
medical engineering, recently 
received a $1 million grant 
from the Commonwealth Uni-
versal Research Enhancement 
(CURE) program to develop 
more speci?c cancer-detec-
tion computer programs. The 
project is also supported by a 
$500,000 grant from the Om-
nyx Corporation.
Murphy will be the lead 
director of the project; he and 
Rohde will be assisted by pa-
thologists from the University 
of Pittsburgh Medical Center 
(UPMC).
Rohde and Murphy plan for 
the project to be able to ana-
lyze the tissues of thousands 
of patients — which, consider-
ing the rate at which scientists 
currently analyze tissue, is a 
huge innovation.
When a potential tumor is 
spotted, a patient undergoes 
a biopsy — the removal of a 
piece of tissue. As of now, to 
determine cancer verdicts, 
pathologists observe the cells 
in the biopsies in labs. These 
specialists use medical equip-
ment, patient history, and 
broad knowledge to diagnose 
a tissue sample. Despite the 
pathologists’ expertise, the 
cancer diagnosis process can 
be relatively slow, and still re-
lies on human judgment with-
out much assistance.
In Rohde’s and Murphy’s 
project, images of the tissue 
would be entered into a com-
puter program that would seg-
ment the image of tissue into 
smaller images of thousands 
of individual cells. Next, these 
cellular portraits would be 
compared to images of other 
cells — both cancerous and 
healthy — in the program’s 
data bank.
The program would then 
be able to use an algorithm 
to match the image of the cell 
with other similar or nearly 
identical images. Using stored 
information on the match-
ing cell images, the program 
would determine the probabil-
ity of whether the cell in ques-
tion is dangerous.
Speci?cally, Rohde and 
Murphy’s research will focus 
on certain types of prostate 
and liver cancers.
Rohde has already cre-
ated programs for such com-
puter systems, usually using 
a data set of 10–15 people. 
This project will allow his lab 
to test the system on a much 
larger scale with thousands 
of people. And since it’s such 
an advanced undertaking, the 
program needs an incredibly 
large amount of data. Murphy 
and Rohde are collaborating 
with pathologists at UPMC 
to help gather the necessary 
information.
While Rohde’s primary 
focus is using data to match 
the images of cells, Murphy’s 
research focuses on the indi-
vidual proteins of the cells. 
Each cell has thousands of 
proteins, too many to be fea-
sibly observed by any human. 
Murphy’s lab, however, is 
aimed at looking at subcel-
lular compartments referred 
to as organelles, and trying 
to decipher localized proteins 
that may be speci?c to certain 
liver or pqwancreatic cancers. 
The data would, like Rohde’s 
program, be able to tell the 
pathologist the nature of the 
proteins.
Rohde claims the project 
has the potential to make a 
large impact in the area of 
cancer research and identi?-
cation. It’s important to note, 
however, that the program 
is just another tool to make 
cancer detection more ef?-
cient and effective. Rohde ex-
plained that it allows patholo-
gists to perform tasks that 
humans can’t, like quantifying 
huge amounts of data.
Rohde is excited by the 
potential magnitude of the 
project. “When opportunity 
comes to transition this to the 
real world [it is] always excit-
ing,” he said. “I think everyone 
appreciates the opportunity 
that, if this is to work well, 
[it] could be meaningful and 
good for a lot of people, for us 
professionally, but also for the 
greater good.”
The end goal of the entire 
project is to create a product 
that could be sold and used 
in a healthcare setting, rather 
than be a conversation piece 
for an academic’s of?ce.

This year, Dining Services has 
made a real effort to expand and im-
prove on-campus dining locations, 
with the addition of at least four new 
eateries (Nakama Express, El Gallo 
de Oro, the Creperie, and Stackers). 
We appreciate the steps that have 
been made to improve students’ din-
ing experience; for the most part, the 
changes have been successful.
Nakama Express, which replaced 
Sushi Too, has a larger variety of su-
shi blocks to choose from than did its 
predecessor, with a tasty and entirely 
vegetarian option available. The eat-
ery also has a Chef’s Special Creation 
menu item, adding a little variety to 
students’ often routine dining expe-
riences.
Stackers is another new restau-
rant in Resnik. Its sandwich-building 
station, similar to Subway or Quiz-
nos, is a welcome addition on cam-
pus. The Creperie, located on the 
second ?oor of the University Cen-
ter, is also doing quite well, with fre-
quent long lines of students waiting 
for sweet or savory crepes.
The one new addition to campus 
dining that doesn’t sit quite well with 
the Carnegie Mellon community is El 
Gallo de Oro. 
As good as the eatery’s quesadil-
las might be, it will always and for-
ever be compared to more popular 
Mexican cuisine, like Chipotle or 
other burrito chains. Students have 
these tasty options readily available 
off campus, so if El Gallo de Oro 
wants to win over students, it needs 
to step up its game.
And while many of the new dining 
locations have impressed us, some of 
the older ones have as well. Skibo, 
for instance, has really improved 
the quality of its food since last year. 
Many students have a love-hate rela-
tionship with the eatery because of 
its history of subpar food and spotty 
service. But where else can a hungry, 
stressed-out student get a bite to eat 
late at night?
Skibo seems to have improved its 
service. The staff seems to be keep-
ing more food in stock so late-night 
eaters have an actual menu to or-
der from, there are more side items 
to choose from, and they’re putting 
some extra care into food prepa-
ration. The eatery hasn’t changed 
much on their menu, so when the 
quality of the food improves, it’s es-
pecially noticeable.
If you’ve been disillusioned with 
campus eateries in the past, give 
them another chance. We would en-
courage students to try out all the 
new dining locations and give Dining 
Services the feedback it needs.
Students need more awareness of campus changes
On-campus dining options make delicious comeback
Voting registration efforts are welcome on campus
With Nov. 6 quickly approaching, 
voters will once again make impor-
tant decisions that will shape the 
future of the nation. However, with 
recent changes to the voting process 
— including the institution of the 
Voter ID Law — voting may become 
more dif?cult. In addition to this 
law, college students in particular 
may ?nd voting in this coming elec-
tion especially troublesome because 
of issues with absentee voting and 
the potential lack of proper identi?-
cation.
With these impending dif?culties, 
we deeply appreciate the measures 
taken by student government, Col-
lege Democrats, PennPIRG, and oth-
er partnered organizations to make 
voter registration easier and more 
accessible to students.
If you have crossed the Cut since 
the semester started, then you have 
no doubt seen the tables set up to 
register students to vote or to provide 
additional help for students who are 
currently registered in other states. 
Volunteers are also scattered across 
campus, approaching students in 
attempts to ensure that they will be 
able to vote on Election Day.
At times, being approached every 
day by volunteers with clipboards 
asking you if you’re registered can 
be annoying. However, this is prefer-
able to not having any readily avail-
able resources.
With the hectic schedules and 
immense workloads most students 
face, making sure you are properly 
registered to vote before the appro-
priate deadlines may not be so easy. 
Providing options and information 
to the student body on campus helps 
alleviate some issues with the convo-
luted registration system.
The student government execu-
tives have outlined further plans to 
increase awareness for the coming 
election and to ensure that students 
have the resources available to prop-
erly register. These measures include 
making absentee voting methods 
available and summarizing the posi-
tions of local candidates for students, 
according to the student government 
executives’ platform and a recent let-
ter to The Tartan on student govern-
ment initiatives and progress.
We commend student govern-
ment’s coordination efforts with 
College Democrats and PennPIRG to 
register student voters, and we hope 
such efforts are further expanded 
upon throughout the semester as we 
approach Election Day. 
Providing these resources to stu-
dents is an excellent way to coun-
teract the apathy that often plagues 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus and to en-
sure that our voices are heard in the 
coming election.

Since this summer, there have 
been many signi?cant changes to 
campus that affect the student body. 
We’ve seen parking meters erected 
on Margaret Morrison Street, the 
recently altered noise policy for stu-
dent organizations, and new campus 
eateries added — to name just a few. 
Regardless of whether or not 
these developments directly bene?t 
students, there is one complaint that 
connects all of them: Many students 
feel that they were not adequately 
informed of decisions that would af-
fect them, if they were informed at 
all. 
This complaint should be ad-
dressed by the university administra-
tion as soon as possible.
The administration most likely 
has its own methods in place for de-
ciding what information to dissemi-
nate to the student body, and these 
methods for deciding are probably 
well thought out. 
However, judging by many stu-
dents’ negative responses to their 
?nding out about these changes after 
they’ve already occurred, the current 
methods of dissemination simply 
aren’t working.
The student body regularly re-
ceives emails about university press 
releases, usually regarding the re-
tiring of faculty members or the 
achievements of alumni. 
While it’s admittedly important to 
acknowledge esteemed members of 
our community, these are pieces of 
news that might be best kept to the 
website meant for university press 
releases, in order to save these emails 
for changes in the Carnegie Mellon 
community that directly affect stu-
dents. This would probably be a bet-
ter option than emailing about every 
update, as students are rather inun-
dated with campus-related emails 
already.
Another method of getting im-
portant information to interested 
parties might be to post everything 
on the university press releases web-
site, then have members of Student 
Senate get out the information that’s 
pertinent to the student body’s liveli-
hood through the use of social media 
like Facebook, Twitter, and website 
updates.
Regardless of how this problem is 
addressed, it should be done before 
students are surprised by yet anoth-
er, perhaps unwelcome, change.
Manipulated statistics give voters wrong idea
ELI ZOGHLIN
Junior Staffwriter
With the upcoming election, we 
as citizens and potential voters are 
subjected to a veritable storm of po-
litical advertisements.
One campaign advertisement 
supporting President Barack Obama 
called Republican presidential 
candidate Mitt Romney a “corpo-
rate raider,” saying that he sent 
thousands of jobs overseas at Bain 
Capital while showing pictures of 
him smiling. It clearly casts his past 
business career in a malicious light, 
making it seem like Romney en-
joyed outsourcing American jobs. 
On the other hand, various Romney 
campaign advertisements criticize 
Obamacare and suggest that Obama 
has it out for old people. Pictures of 
depressed and lonely-looking senior 
citizens ?ash by, while the advertise-
ments talk about raising the costs of 
services for the elderly.
While the accuracy of either of 
these claims is debatable, our can-
didates are clearly attempting to 
manipulate voters’ emotions. Such 
strategies have always been in Amer-
ican politics; politicians will always 
manipulate their opponents’ images 
and mudsling. It is far easier to con-
vince the average voter by playing 
to his or her fears and desires rather 
than by using concrete facts.
I ?nd these advertisements dis-
tasteful, regardless of the side they 
are aimed at. However, these per-
sonal attacks are not the politick-
ing technique that makes me the 
most furious. Politicians toss around 
statistics, often using the same one 
or two numbers in order to make a 
point. These statistics are usually 
simple and therefore easy to use as 
a talking point and a buzzword. The 
trouble with these sound bite-style 
statistics is that they are often mis-
leading, out of context, or just plain 
wrong.
To illustrate, on Sept. 8, Obama 
claimed at an appearance in Semi-
nole, Fla., that, “We’ve doubled our 
use of renewable energy.” However, 
there is more to this catch-all statis-
tic that meets the eye. When one digs 
a little deeper, it is clear that this ac-
complishment is far less important 
than it seems. The use of all types of 
renewable energy has actually only 
increased by 55 percent, according 
to PoltiFact.com. Solar and wind 
power match up to Obama’s statis-
tic, but they make up only a fraction 
of renewable energy sources. After 
including the less impressive growth 
in sources like hydroelectric and 
geothermal power, Obama’s claim 
becomes completely false.
The president is by no means the 
only one doing this: Romney spouts 
similar misleading statistics. In a 
recently released video of a private 
Romney fundraising event, he said 
that 47 percent of households don’t 
pay taxes. It appears to be a shock-
ing failure in the American tax code.
But there’s a catch. First, that 
fact is no longer accurate, as it’s 
based off data taken from 2009. In 
addition, the statistic only refers to 
federal income taxes. Many families 
make so little that they don’t pay 
federal income taxes, but they still 
pay state and local taxes as well as 
investment and payroll taxes. 
In both cases, the statistic is tech-
nically true, but only by a caveat that 
is either made or disregarded by the 
candidate. It’s clear that politicians 
can use statistics to control and ma-
nipulate us. The real question is, 
why are we as a society allowing 
that to happen?
The reason politicians get to de-
pend on statistics is because people 
are ignorant of their true nature. 
We need a populace that gains 
skepticism of all simple sound bite 
statistics by understanding them at 
a basic level. This means we need 
to reprioritize our mathematical 
education system. We need a bigger 
emphasis on statistics and statistical 
analysis at an earlier age.
By helping the population see 
through the haze and fog of twist-
ed statistics, we can have a voting 
populace that is far more capable of 
seeing beyond politicking and mud-
slinging. Another aspect of democ-
racy is its goal to represent the com-
mon man’s opinion and serve the 
people. If the people can see clearly 
what is happening in their country 
by interpreting data, they can more 
easily cast their vote in accordance 
with their beliefs and opinions.
LETTER TO THE EDITORCarnegie Mellon stress helps students develop
Dear Carnegie Mellon,
Up until now, I didn’t think I’d 
changed at all since high school. I 
still believe in the same things, make 
the same lame jokes, forget people’s 
names, and all that stuff. But actu-
ally, Carnegie Mellon, you’ve made 
me forget what the word “hard” 
means.
I realized this when some stu-
dents in Concepts class complained 
that the homework was too hard be-
cause they had to get help on it. My 
?rst reaction was to laugh because, 
duh, you weren’t supposed to know 
how to do it without help. But not all 
of them know that. I didn’t when I 
?rst came to college.
If I could ?ash back to freshman 
year, you would see someone con-
stantly wrestling with feelings of 
inadequacy. 
Every time I couldn’t solve a prob-
lem on the problem set, I blamed the 
professor for making things too hard 
or blamed my own intelligence. It 
sucked. I felt small every day.
But somewhere along the way, 
I realized that you were supposed 
to need help. If the homework was 
easy enough that you could just 
coast by, then you were actually 
wasting your time, because it’s when 
things are challenging and you need 
help or you’re going to die that you 
end up learning and getting more 
out of stuff.
As a result, I literally don’t see 
anything as “hard” anymore. If any-
thing, it’s “doable,” and the idea that 
every problem you could ever come 
across is doable is a comforting idea. 
I have to thank you, Carnegie Mel-
lon, for constantly making me do 
things that I don’t immediately un-
derstand because I no longer see un-
certainty as a measure of my intel-
ligence, but rather of my initiative.
TL;DR: By making me feel stupid, 
I don’t feel stupid anymore.

Both ?lm and extremists to blameiPhone 5 doesn’t have that revolutionary feel
Privacy nonexistent in 21st century
LUKE MASA
Junior Staffwriter
Would you be willing to kill for 
your beliefs? A portion of us may be 
able to profess our willingness to die 
for what we hold most dear, but tak-
ing the life of another doesn’t often 
factor into our thought processes. Yet 
there are those who seem to be on 
the offensive in being offended, tak-
ing even the smallest slight against 
their ideas as a declaration of war.
Recently Nakoula Basseley 
Nakoula, under the assumed name 
of Sam Bacile, released a ?lm titled 
Innocence of Muslims. The ?lm de-
picts the Muslim prophet Muham-
mad as a child abuser, womanizer, 
and homosexual. Needless to say, 
such a portrayal of the ?gure — who, 
in the Islamic faith, is not meant to 
be depicted at all — stirred up quite 
the controversy.
In the days after the ?lm’s trans-
lation into Arabic, there were mass 
riots outside various Western embas-
sies. Flags were burned, threats were 
issued, and many were injured; some 
even died. 
Unfortunately, such a turn of 
events should come as no surprise 
considering the 2005 controversy of 
a Danish cartoon’s depiction of Mu-
hammad, as well as various other ex-
amples that have made headlines in 
the past decade.
Nakoula was well aware of the 
response his ?lm would elicit, and 
probably counted on it. He deceived 
those he worked with in the produc-
tion of the ?lm — he pretended to be 
a Jewish Israeli, when in fact he is 
an Egyptian Coptic Christian. More 
importantly, an actor from the ?lm, 
Miles Crawley, revealed to the Los 
Angeles Times that Nakoula duped 
the ?lm’s actors into thinking they 
were in a Biblical-era reenactment 
and proceeded to overdub a portion 
of their lines with references to Mu-
hammad and the Quran.
There is no question that the ac-
tions taken by Nakoula were wrong, 
and they should in no way be ex-
cused. 
The ?lm itself is extremely offen-
sive not just to Muslims, but also to 
the sensibilities of most people. That 
being said, it speaks of a more dire 
problem that approximately 14 min-
utes of a YouTube video can spark 
global violence.
South Park, Family Guy, and other 
such programs have made far more 
offensive material directed at Chris-
tians in the past, and even the most 
Bible-thumping of the evangelicals 
have done little more than express 
their typical canned response involv-
ing their being “oppressed.”
How is it that, in this day and age, 
there are still ideas that are unassail-
able? It is depressing if one cannot 
express criticism without the fear 
of death. Such an extremist, funda-
mentalist, and distorted view of the 
ideology attempts to destroy any and 
all opposition to it, instead of dis-
cussing the problems raised in a lev-
elheaded and rational matter.
There may not be a solution to 
this problem, other than perhaps 
waiting several more generations for 
the most fervent adherents to disap-
pear. 
But such a solution is not an ad-
equate response to what appears to 
be one of the most grave matters of 
our time. Coupled with the prolifera-
tion of nuclear weapons and our con-
tinued misuse of natural resources, I 
shudder to think what future we will 
be left to inherit, if any at all.
One can only hope that there can 
be an awakening of skepticism and 
free thinking on a level far greater 
than the recent reactionary mea-
sures taken throughout the world. I 
wrote last week that maybe creation-
ism was ?nally in its death throes, 
but it would appear that fundamen-
talism of a different ?avor will put up 
a much greater ?ght.
I will question everything, and 
never become so steadfast or con?-
dent in my worldview so as to in?ict 
harm upon those who dissent. 
I encourage you to do the same, 
but I won’t threaten violence if you 
don’t.

This month, another royal scan-
dal hit the papers. This time, Cath-
erine, the Duchess of Cambridge, 
caught the media’s eye while she 
and her husband, Prince William, 
were vacationing in France. A pho-
tograph of the former Ms. Middle-
ton sunbathing topless appeared in 
the French version of the magazine 
Closer, taken while the couple were 
staying in a private villa.
The royal family sued the French 
magazine and won; the magazine 
is no longer allowed to publish the 
photographs, under threat of heavy 
?nes.
Of course, once this scandal be-
came news, everyone had an opinion 
to offer. They ranged from Donald 
Trump’s totally unsympathetic state-
ment via Twitter, “Kate Middleton 
is great — but she shouldn’t be sun-
bathing in the nude — only herself 
to blame,” to the unrealistic state-
ment by Rosa Monckton, a friend of 
William’s late mother, who pleaded 
“leave Kate alone” via Twitter.
The Duchess and Duke have a 
right to their privacy, but that doesn’t 
mean they’ll get it. If the Duchess of 
Cambridge wants to take her shirt off 
while sunbathing with her husband, 
that’s her choice, but her decision 
will have consequences. The amount 
of effort people put into knowing ev-
ery single detail about her life, and 
the lives of celebrities in general, is 
ridiculous. Unfortunately, it’s the 
level of obsession that comes with 
being a public ?gure.
Before Middleton’s marriage, the 
situation might have been different, 
but she married into one of the only 
royal families still prominent and ac-
tive in the social world. She was the 
girl next door who married a prince. 
That’s the stuff from which Disney 
has made millions of dollars, so the 
story has a certain appeal. No one 
ever mentions the crazed paparazzi 
lurking at the end of your driveway 
after the nuptials are over, but hey, 
Disney’s only got two hours to work 
with.
The problem with living in such a 
media-dependent world is that noth-
ing ever goes away. The Duchess 
learned that lesson the hard way this 
month; her brother-in-law Prince 
Harry learned it too, at a party in 
Las Vegas in August. What happens 
in Vegas de?nitely does not stay in 
Vegas, a private French villa is never 
completely private, and once some-
thing gets on the internet, it will 
never disappear. This is a lesson that 
applies to more than just the royal 
families of the world: college stu-
dents would do well to remember it 
too. In a world where everyone and 
his mother has a smartphone, every 
minute has the potential to be caught 
on ?lm.
Once those pictures hit the in-
ternet, there’s no going back. Right 
now, it may seem like a brilliant idea 
to post pictures of yourself drunk, 
smoking weed, or making out with 
your signi?cant other. But what 
about when a company you want an 
internship with checks your Face-
book? Or a potential employer inves-
tigates your Twitter? The internet is a 
public place, and people are going to 
be watching, regardless of your royal 
status.
BRADEN KELNER
Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook recent-
ly took the stage in San Francisco, 
Calif., to announce the tech giant’s 
latest and greatest in handheld tech-
nology. Standing before a crowded 
room of tech enthusiasts, Cook dis-
cussed the release of a variety of 
new Apple products, including a 
redesigned iPod Touch, iPod Nano, 
and a device the world has been an-
ticipating since 2010: the iPhone 5.
Although Cook followed tradi-
tion by unveiling the company’s lat-
est smartphone at an annual press 
conference, he failed to meet the 
audience’s expectations for a device 
that stands to change the game of 
the smartphone world. Despite a va-
riety of improvements over Apple’s 
earlier iPhone models, the iPhone 
5 fails to impress on the same level 
as previous devices — yes, even the 
iPhone 4S.
I must admit the iPhone 5’s im-
provements over the 4S are vast: 4G 
LTE data speeds, a 4-inch screen, a 
thinner design, an improved charg-
ing port, revamped headphones, 
and a faster processor, to name a 
few.
But where is the “wow” factor 
that usually accompanies an iPhone 
unveiling? Where’s the new feature 
that sets the iPhone apart from its 
competitors and older siblings?
The original iPhone revolution-
ized the smart phone industry. 
The iPhone 3G made faster speeds 
mainstream and established the 
concept of an App Store. The 3GS 
even introduced an improved cam-
era and bee?er processor which, at 
the time, was enough to impress. 
The iPhone 4 welcomed FaceTime, a 
high resolution retina display, and a 
new hardware design. The 4S came 
equipped with sassy voice-assistant 
Siri.
No other phone had these fea-
tures at the time of its release, effec-
tively setting these iPhone models 
apart from the competition.
Now the tables have turned. Ap-
ple is no longer the leader in innova-
tion, as evidenced from the iPhone 
5’s announcement. None of the 
major features introduced by Apple 
at the conference are unique to the 
iPhone 5, and many of the features 
have already been integrated by oth-
er tech companies.
What about 4G LTE speeds? 
They’ve been around so long — 
since 2010 — that they have become 
standard among smartphones.
What about the bigger 4-inch 
screen? Been there, done that. With 
phones like the Samsung Galaxy S 
III, which boasts a 4.8-inch screen, 
the iPhone 5’s screen doesn’t seem 
so big.
But what about the new design? 
Take a look at the iPhone 4 and then 
ask yourself again how new the de-
sign is.
The release of the iPhone 5 is 
even more disappointing when one 
considers what could have been 
included beneath the shiny metal 
covering. 
With all the talk regarding near 
?eld communication (NFC), a tech-
nology that allows data transferring 
such as ticket or credit card pay-
ments through a smartphone, Apple 
had the chance to make an estab-
lished but underdeveloped technol-
ogy an industry standard. 
Not only would the inclusion 
of an easy-to-use version of NFC 
have set the iPhone 5 apart from 
other smartphones, it would have 
changed the way society handles 
store purchases.
Let’s face it: Apple is playing 
catch-up. In a world where it was 
once the leader, Apple has fallen 
behind the pack — or at least into 
the middle of a class of high-end 
smartphones. The latest iteration of 
the iPhone serves the sole purpose 
of adding necessary upgrades to a 
device that will sell record numbers 
because of its loyal fanbase and rep-
utation, not because of innovative 
features.
That said, my preordered iPhone 
is set to ship soon and you can bet 
I’m counting down the seconds until 
it arrives.

Max Tassano puts three past Bison goalie in victory
ADAM GRUBER
Sports Co-Editor
The No. 7-ranked men’s 
soccer team put on a goal-
scoring showcase on the back 
of junior forward Max Tas-
sano’s three goals and one 
assist, beating the Bethany 
College Bison 6–2. After the 
victory, the Tartans’ record 
sits at 7–1, having won ?ve 
games straight. The Bison’s 
record, meanwhile, fell to 
1–6.
By keeping up the attack 
throughout the entire game, 
the Tartans were able to bury 
the Bison, scoring three goals 
in both halves. Carnegie Mel-
lon more than tripled the 
number of shots on goal the 
Bison had, winning that sta-
tistic 27–8.
Those shots put pres-
sure on the Bison defense all 
game long and kept the ball 
away from their offense. But 
Tassano’s pinpoint shooting 
kept the Tartans ef?cient: 
He scored three times on just 
three shots. Junior mid?eld-
ers Chris Wysocki and Matt 
Sarett led the Tartans with 
?ve shots on goal each.
“[Tassano] was a consis-
tent threat the entire game 
and capitalized on the oppor-
tunities he was given,” senior 
forward Alex Abedian said. 
“Doing these things are both 
traits of a high-quality for-
ward.”
Sarrett also scored a goal, 
along with senior defender 
Ben Bryant and junior de-
fender Cole Christensen.
Excellent passing helped 
the Tartans create these scor-
ing opportunities; of the six 
goals, four were assisted and 
Tassano, Bryant, Wysocki, 
and sophomore mid?elder 
Brandon Peck all assisted on 
goals in the game. 
The Bison offense was kept 
away from the action for most 
of the game, so junior goal-
keeper Christopher Madden 
was not challenged too much 
in goal in this bout. 
Carnegie Mellon has a his-
tory of dominating the Bison, 
beating Bethany College ?ve 
consecutive times dating back 
to the 2008 season.
The Tartans are back on 
the ?eld at home on Sunday 
against the Washington Uni-
versity Bears in St. Louis. The 
game is scheduled to start at 
1:30 p.m.

Women’s soccer undefeated 
after win over Fighting Scots
CARL GLAZER
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team staved 
off the College of Wooster 
Fighting Scots last Saturday 
with a 3–1 victory, remaining 
undefeated this season and 
bringing its overall record to 
6–0–2.
The game was a defensive 
struggle with only seven to-
tal shots on goal registered 
between the two teams. After 
initially starting off aggres-
sive and keeping the ball in 
the Fighting Scots’ half of the 
?eld, the Tartans fell victim to 
a quick free kick goal in the 
13th minute against junior 
keeper Anna Albi.
Riled up, senior forward 
Brianna Magill quickly re-
sponded by scoring her sec-
ond goal of the season 19 sec-
onds later. First-year forward 
Louisa Pendergast set up the 
shot with her ?rst of two as-
sists for the day.
After missed opportunities 
on corner kicks for both sides, 
the score remained 1–1 going 
into halftime. 
After battling back a peri-
od-opening surge by Wooster, 
the Tartans ?nally took the 
lead with a goal by sopho-
more mid?elder Lucy Havens 
in the 59th minute. Pender-
gast recorded her second as-
sist of the game as Havens 
made her second goal of the 
season.
Both teams then struggled 
to control the ball and get any 
offense going until sopho-
more forward Courtney Brant 
put the game out of reach 
with her second goal of the 
season in the 82nd minute.
At one point, the game 
had a 50-minute delay due 
to lightning in the area, but 
the Tartans came back just 
as strong to secure their sixth 
victory of the young season.
“It was a great team win 
for us. We came together and 
fought hard after being down 
1–0 early on. It was a game 
that was good preparation 
as we head into conference 
play,” said senior mid?elder 
Stephanie Hare.
Carnegie Mellon will play 
an away game against Grove 
City College on Wednesday 
before beginning University 
Athletic Association confer-
ence play against Washington 
University in St. Louis Bears 
on Sunday at home. 
Last season, Carnegie Mel-
lon came up short against 
Washington University in St. 
Louis. The Bears beat the Tar-
tans 3–0, as they were ranked 
No. 12 in NCAA D-III women’s 
soccer.
The Tartans look poised to 
redeem last season’s loss af-
ter remaining undefeated in 
eight games thus far and the 
Bears falling out of the top 25.
Sunday’s game begins at 
11 a.m.

lost the battle to expand the 
sport into nontraditional re-
gions in the Sun Belt.
Most of the problems 
that caused this lockout are 
a result of the failing Sun 
Belt franchises. These fran-
chises failed to attract the 
fair-weather fans, and any 
foothold gained by the teams 
was wiped out by the previous 
lockout.
The NHL is losing its battle 
against other major league 
sports. This has created a 
downward spiral: Teams can-
not ?ll arenas, and therefore 
cannot create enough revenue 
to afford a competitive roster. 
These losing teams drive away 
fans, leaving arenas barren. 
In order for the NHL to 
regain its status as one of 
America’s top sports organi-
zations, it may be necessary 
to contract the league back 
to its roots in Canada and the 
northern U.S.
Hockey also suffers from 
high start-up costs in order 
for youth to play. Ice hockey is 
just as hard, since it requires 
ice — which is not widely 
available in most of the U.S. 
— and skates, which are ex-
pensive. Compare this to a 
game of basketball, which 
only requires a ball and a 
hoop.
This current lockout is just 
another example of how out of 
touch the league’s owners are 
from both current and future 
fans. The 2004–05 lockout 
nearly killed the league and 
yet, eight years later, we are 
in the same situation. Hockey 
players are already paid the 
least compared to players 
in other big sports leagues, 
yet owners are still unhappy 
enough about money to dis-
rupt their revenue stream.
Unless the league sees the 
light and begins to under-
stand its current place on the 
edge of American sports, the 
NHL may not be able to ex-
ist much longer in its current 
state. If this lockout elimi-
nates a full season like it did 
eight years ago, I’m not con?-
dent the league will be able to 
come back.

gers on Saturday by a score of 
51–28. The 51-point offensive 
outburst helped the Tartans 
reach a total record of 4–0 for 
the season.
Junior full back Zachary 
Erra-Hernandez led the way 
for the Tartans, rushing for 
116 yards and three touch-
downs on 14 carries. As a 
whole, the team rushed for an 
incredible 220 yards, averag-
ing an astounding 5.4 yards 
per carry.
The Tigers’ inability to stop 
the Tartans’ rushing game 
opened up the passing game, 
as junior quarterback Rob 
Kalkstein completed 13 of his 
15 passes for 314 yards and 
three touchdowns. Kalkstein 
hit DePauw early, completing 
an 83-yard touchdown pass to 
sophomore wide receiver Tim-
othy Swanson on the ?rst play 
of the game after the opening 
kickoff.
“We had great protection 
for Robbie [Kalkstein] and his 
receivers ran excellent pat-
terns,” said head coach Rick 
Lackner. “Robbie made great 
in-game choices, all a part of 
good preparation by offensive 
coordinator Rich Erdelyi and 
his staff.”
Swanson was Kalkstein’s 
favorite target for the game, 
but only marginally. Swanson 
had four receptions for 153 
yards and two touchdowns, 
while junior wide receiver Tim 
Kikta had three receptions for 
95 yards and a touchdown.
While the DePauw de-
fense had no trouble racking 
up yardage, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s ability to force turnovers 
kept the Tigers’ offense off 
the ?eld. DePauw’s interim 
head coach Scott Srnka relied 
too much on ?rst-year quar-
terback Justin Murray, who 
threw two interceptions in the 
game. Murray threw 40 times, 
only completing 20 passes, al-
though he found the end zone 
four times.
The Tartan defense also 
forced three fumbles, recov-
ering two. Senior lineback-
ers Nick Karabin and Chris 
Blomstedt led the team with 
11 tackles each, and Karabin 
forced and recovered one of 
the aforementioned fumbles. 
Sophomore outside line-
backer Alex D’Angelo was the 
receiver for both of Murray’s 
interceptions.
This Saturday, the Tartans 
travel to Wabash College in 
Crawfordsville, Ind., to play 
the Little Giants. Kickoff is at 
2 p.m.

For the second time in 
eight seasons, National Hock-
ey League (NHL) owners 
have locked out their players. 
This is now the fourth time 
the league has locked out its 
players in its history. With all 
of the September preseason 
games canceled and with the 
players and owners refusing 
to negotiate, the possibility 
of a quick resolution seems 
bleak. What the NHL own-
ers fail to realize, however, 
is that whatever money they 
gain through the negotia-
tions will be lost to massive 
public backlash.
Unlike the other major 
American sports leagues, the 
NHL has signi?cant overseas 
competition. The Kontinental 
Hockey League (KHL) out of 
Eurasia is the NHL’s largest 
competitor for top talent. As 
more elite hockey talent is 
developed in Eastern Europe, 
the decision to move to the 
U.S. and embrace a new cul-
ture is not as easy as it was 
when Washington Capitals 
left winger Alexander Ovech-
kin came over in 2005.
While the NHL may have 
been set up for a talent war 
with the KHL in the com-
ing years, it certainly isn’t 
doing itself any favors with 
the lockout. Many players, 
including Ovechkin, have al-
ready signed contracts with 
teams in the KHL to play for 
the upcoming season. This 
exodus both strengthens the 
NHL’s competition and elimi-
nates the owners’ strongest 
bargaining chip.
The recent lockouts in the 
NBA and NFL met somewhat 
timely conclusions because 
players were pining for their 
pay checks and didn’t have 
anywhere else to turn. Foot-
ball is played at a high level 
only in the U.S. and, while 
basketball has expanded its 
global presence, the rest of 
the world pales in compari-
son to the NBA.
The NHL is on thin ice in 
terms of fan support. After 
the 2004–05 lockout, the 
league faced an uphill battle 
in trying to regain public sup-
port. While it has since rebuilt 
its fan base in the traditional 
hockey regions, the NHL has

New to the Carnegie Mellon baseball team 
is ?rst-year pitcher Darren Kerfoot, hailing 
from San Dimas, Calif.
“I’ve been playing baseball for 14 years, 
since I was four years old,” he said. He had 
hoped to continue to pursue his love for base-
ball during his college career.
Kerfoot has already jumped to the top of the 
Tartan’s rotaton. His fastball clocks in at over 
85 miles per hour, with his curveball 20 miles 
per hour slower than his fast ball. He also has 
a slider and a changeup in his arsenal. He is 
2–0 on the season, with 24 strikeouts and an 
earned run average (ERA) of 1.28.
Although Kerfoot is currently a math major, 
he plans to graduate with a mechanical en-
gineering degree before pursuing a full-time 
career. Despite only just entering college, he 
is already planning to complete a master’s de-
gree at Stanford University and play on their 
baseball team.
But for now, Kerfoot is adjusting to the 
Carnegie Mellon baseball team well. “I really 
enjoy baseball. The thing I enjoy most is that 
everyone is there to have a good time, and also 
that I get to actually play with really smart peo-
ple. It’s awesome,” he said.
He added, “I am really proud each time I 
step on the ?eld because it’s just a great atmo-
sphere to play in.”
“Darren has been a great addition to the 
team,” said senior second baseman Joe Bar-
bish. “He has been able to keep hitters off 
balance with his powerful fastball and hard-
breaking, off-speed pitches.”
Even though it is his ?rst season as a Tartan 
athlete, Kerfoot has made a checklist of goals 
he wants to complete before his time on the 
baseball team ends. “For myself, I’d like to get 
my ERA under 1.00 and hit at least .400. I also 
really hope to get CMU baseball to become an 
NCAA sport before I graduate,” Kerfoot said.
However, for Kerfoot, representing Carne-
gie Mellon is the most important part of being 
on the baseball team. “I think the most reward-
ing thing is being able to play a sport, get away 
from the academics for a little bit, have some 
fun with some great guys, and keep playing a 
sport I love while studying my ass off,” he said.

This past weekend, the 
Tartan volleyball team trav-
eled to Huntingdon, Pa., to 
compete in the Juniata Tour-
nament.
The team’s ?rst match was 
against Salisbury University, 
where the Tartans suffered a 
3–0 (25–20, 25–20, 25–18) 
loss. Junior outside hitter 
Senna Parsa picked up eight 
digs and eight kills in the 
match. Junior middle blocker 
Olivia Mora tallied four block 
assists. The Tartans displayed 
strong defense against Salis-
bury, with the team ?nishing 
the game with 33 digs over-
all.
“Salisbury was a great 
team, and we played with 
them for most of the games, 
but just couldn’t get the ball 
back during crucial points in 
the match,” said junior libero 
Ali Nichols. “For the next 
game, we really decided to 
focus on communication and 
playing as a team.”
At the end the ?rst day 
of the weekend-long tour-
nament, the Tartans played 
Franklin and Marshall Col-
lege. The team gained a 3–0 
(25–23, 25–17, 25–20) vic-
tory. Parsa had 15 kills, while 
Nichols ended the match 
with nine digs. Junior setter 
Emily Wright had 17 assists.
On the second day of 
the tournament, the team 
matched up against Fairleigh 
Dickinson University at Flor-
ham. The Tartans had a 3–0 
(25–8, 25–20, 25–16) vic-
tory. Parsa excelled in this 
match, picking up 10 kills, 10 
digs, and four service aces. 
Nichols also had a great per-
formance with 15 digs.
The Tartans played Juni-
ata College in the last match 
of the tournament. Although 
they lost 3–1 (25–21, 25–18, 
25–13, 27–25), the Tartans 
had a strong offensive match. 
Mora had 10 kills, Parsa and 
sophomore Alexandra Celen-
tano each had eight kills, and 
?rst-year middle blocker Re-
becca Wol?nger had six kills. 
“Throughout the week-
end, they played really well. 
The [Franklin and Marshall 
College] match was a really 
good win,” head coach Kim 
Kelly said. “They played to-
gether and our defense really 
came together.”
In Tartan victories, the 
players put together solid 
performances both offensive-
ly and defensively.
The next volleyball game 
is at home, where the Tartans 
will host Waynesburg Univer-
sity this Wednesday at 7 p.m.

Sketch comedy group visits CMU
The Cambridge Footlights put on hilarious, successful show
The Cambridge Footlights, a sketch comedy group 
from Cambridge University in England, performed its 
show “Perfect Strangers” in McConomy Auditorium 
last Friday. The Footlights, founded in 1883, is known 
for having launched the careers of some well-known 
names in comedy, including John Cleese, Hugh 
Laurie, Stephen Fry, and Sacha Baron Cohen.
“Perfect Strangers,” sponsored and hosted by 
Scotch’n’Soda, featured five members of the troupe 
— Emma Powell, Pierre Novellie, George Pots, Phil 
Wang, and Jason Forbes — performing in a series 
of increasingly interrelated skits. And there was 
nothing dry in this flavor of British humor; skits dealt 
with subjects ranging from the personal lives of Ken 
and Barbie to a film adaptation of the board game 
Monopoly.
“Perfect Strangers” had a broad theme of being 
interconnected. Between quick transitory fadeouts 
to a darkened stage, recurring characters and plots 
would emerge in new skits, slowly completing a 
series of absurd, interwoven comical narratives. A 
wide range of comedic styles was represented in 
these acts, including physical comedy, dark humor, 
and parody.
The performers had spot-on delivery and put on an 
energetic and consistently hilarious act. The most 
memorable skits involved characters who made 
appearances in multiple skits, and skits that were 
more absurd. One skit, for example, involved a man 
who stumbled into Utopia, a seemingly perfect world 
that hid a dark secret.
Another notable skit included an alien hunter 
who used a stick to hit men’s nether regions in an 
attempt to find the extraterrestrials that killed his 
wife.
Many skits included the use of the “time phone,” a 
magical phone that could call people from the past 
and future. Carolyn Supinka, a senior Bachelors of 
Humanities and Arts student, said, “[My friends and 
I] loved the telephone skit. We’ve seen the show 
since we were freshmen, so we knew it was going to 
be good.”
Reactions from the crowd seemed exceedingly 
positive. Throughout the show, audience members 
were howling with laughter and cheers. Nadia 
Sheen, a senior in biology, said, “It was great. It was 
witty, it was clever, and it was fun to watch.”
Overall, the show was a resounding success. It is 
easy to see the incredible amount of comedic talent 
that resides within the Footlights.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I had a couple of 
interviews with this 
company. I thought we 
were really hitting it off, 
but then they stopped 
returning my calls. Did 
I do something wrong? 
I’ve sent the company 
a couple of emails, but 
no response. Am I doing 
something wrong?
Thanks,
Jilted Obnoxiously By 
Some Teasing Recruiter 
Using Career Knowledge
Dear JOBSTRUCK,
Hey man, you’re just going 
to have to face it: The 
company turned you down. 
I know, I know; things may 
have seemed to be going 
well, but there was trouble 
in paradise. The company 
just couldn’t keep its eyes 
from wandering. You may 
feel betrayed, but that’s just 
how the game is played. You 
guys never DTR’ed (Defined 
The Relationship); that’s 
the key step. Don’t expect 
anything ’til you sign that 
contract.
Now you just need to get 
back on that horse. Sure, it 
would have been better if the 
company had called you and 
let you know that you two 
were over, but it’s just easier 
if they stop returning your 
calls. Now it’s time for you to 
play the field and send out 
some résumés. There’s a 
company out there for you; 
just keep looking. Find some 
place with good chemistry 
and nice health benefits.
But at the end of the 
night, don’t be afraid to 
settle,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’ve spent the last day 
in bed. I can’t think of a 
good reason to get up. I 
don’t have class today, I 
have my laptop with me, 
and there’s some food 
within reach. Give me a 
reason to not be such a 
lazy slob.
Thanks,
Comfortable, Overstuffed 
Mattress Attracts Today, 
Only Sleeping Eternally
Dear COMATOSE,
I’m confused; why would 
you want to get out of bed? 
I mean, that sounds pretty 
good to me. The only thing 
you really need to worry 
about is bed sores. But 
as long as you’re not in 
there for a week straight, I 
think you’ll be fine. The one 
argument I can give you 
is that you should go and 
experience the outdoors. 
For the next month or so, 
Pittsburgh will have the best 
weather it’ll have had all 
year. It’ll be cool enough that 
you won’t break into a sweat 
when you step outside, but 
warm enough that you won’t 
need five layers of sweaters.
Pittsburgh in the fall is 
beautiful. I know the 
outdoors can be scary, but 
it’s worth it. In another two 
months, it’ll be too cold and 
snowy to go out and do 
anything. That’s when you 
stay in bed all day with some 
hot chocolate.
Or just say you’re 
practicing corpse pose,
Patrick Hoskins

The last we saw Paul Thomas Anderson, writer and 
director of The Master, it was in Daniel Plainview’s 
bowling alley. It’s been ?ve years since There Will Be 
Blood, and not much has changed. He still writes stories 
about surrogate families, incest, and the American West. 
But The Master shows us a new era of cinema on its own 
terms.
Whatever you think this ?lm might be, you’re wrong. If 
you’re expecting a Scientology exposé, you’re wrong. 
If you’re expecting a climactic payoff, you’re wrong. If 
you’re expecting perfection, you’re wrong. But if you 
surrender and follow The Master, it will show you how 
to see it. It is cinematic panache of the highest order: 
a dazzling, searing, potent, personal American epic. 
Only time will tell, but I predict that 20 years from now, 
everyone will bow to The Master.
The story follows Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a 
Navy veteran of World War II, as he struggles to ?nd 
stability after the war. His greatest talent is creating 
potent beverages out of paint thinners, Lysol, and 
photographic chemicals and using them to seduce 
women. He eventually stows away on a mysterious 
yacht commanded by Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour 
Hoffman), the leader of a group of pseudo-scienti?c 
mystics called The Cause. While this is based on the 
career of L. Ron Hubbard, creator of Scientology, that 
will be the last thing on your mind when the ?lm is over. 
Quell becomes Dodd’s most obedient apostle and soldier, 
and the two develop a chillingly intimate bond that is 
both deeply human and deeply animal.
Human versus animal is the easiest way to summarize 
this expansive, de?ant story. The Cause suggests that 
humans are not members of the animal kingdom, yet 
Quell is prone to vicious ?ts of rage, sexual aggression, 
and fart jokes. It builds the Freudian con?ict of id versus 
ego into a spectacularly repressed, homoerotic love story
This setting is assisted by composer Jonny Greenwood’s 
twitchy, celestial score. The moaning, galactic strings 
of his work for There Will Be Blood have transformed 
into humming winds that, like the ?lm, have no desire 
to reach a conclusion. There will be many attempts to 
explain The Master, but it is best understood as a love 
song — a story about the basic need to be cared for, to 
be mastered.
Shot in the archaic format of 70mm ?lm — twice the 
width of a typical strip, usually reserved for sprawling 
war epics — The Master is a cinephile’s dream come 
true. The ridges and angles of Phoenix’s face are set 
in direct contrast to Hoffman’s plump, round shape. 
Their countenance ?lls the screen to every edge. In one 
scene destined for immortality, Dodd submits Quell to 
“informal processing,” a strange procedure drawn from 
Scientology’s therapeutic philosophies.
The camera lingers on Phoenix for minutes at a time 
as he releases one crushing catharsis after another. His 
performance is like watching a voodoo priest boil every 
ache and pain that you’ve ever felt into a cup of tea. He 
spends most of the movie ready to explode with desire 
and urge.Hoffman, too, channels Orson Welles in a gripping, 
charismatic portrait of a man trying his best to lead. 
Amy Adams, who plays Dodd’s wife Peggy, hardly ever 
leaves the screen. While she’s usually tucked away in an 
out-of-focus corner, she is always hovering over the men, 
mastering them.
Anderson’s script is far from a religious commentary. 
Instead, it shows incredible pathos for the ability to have 
faith, ultimately reasoning that religion is something 
none of us can escape. We all live with a master, whether 
it is another human being or our basic weaknesses. If 
there is a villain in The Master, it’s loneliness.
Anderson understands that our feeble minds can only 
go so far and discover so much. Having faith in our 
smallness is a virtue.

Lively Frame exhibit deals with death
Senior Jessica Aguero tackles tough issues with bold, colorful work
With a spark and a bang, senior art major Jessica 
Aguero’s A Year of Wondering opened on Friday at The 
Frame, a student-run gallery space. The exhibit explores 
the emotions Aguero faced after the death of a friend. 
Rather than tip-toeing around the sensitive topics 
explored in the exhibit, however, Aguero’s work stomps 
right through, powerfully and playfully dealing with the 
onslaught of emotions that accompanies the death of a 
loved one.
“The exhibit is a response to the death of a very close 
friend ... you just have all of these questions and no 
answers. You just have to embrace that there are things 
that you’ll never understand,” Aguero said.
Packing a colorful punch, the exhibit surprisingly evokes 
a sense of liveliness rather than somberness. Balloons 
float across the room, party confetti is artfully clumped 
on the floor, and there’s enough candy to overwhelm 
Willy Wonka.
“We’re so excited about her use of materials, and she 
has a great sense of color,” said Jamie Walters, junior 
art major and co-director of The Frame. “It’s exciting, 
unusual, and elaborate. I thought it would be a good 
exhibition to start the year off like that and draw people 
in with something exciting.”
There’s an incredible amount of whimsical yet profound 
energy packed into the relatively small gallery space. 
The collection of works is so eclectic and emotional, it’s 
impossible not to be drawn in and captivated, first by 
the dazzling array of colors and then by the depth of the 
expression.
The bubbly vibe that the colors and childish wonders 
give off is tempered by subtle reminders of what the 
exhibition is really examining: thoughts and questions 
about life after death.
“She uses interesting and unusual materials and less 
traditional processes,” Walters said.
Highlights of the exhibition include razors that have 
been contorted and fused together into a spherical 
shape, a giant foam tear drop covered in sprinkles, a 
wall mural that invites viewers to contribute with a pile 
of Crayola markers, and a stop-motion video of a girl 
jumping and flipping backwards.
“The video was 40 frames made out of candy and 
frosting. Each frame took a half an hour, and the video is 
only two seconds long,” Aguero said, laughing. “It just 
represents a brief, happy moment.”
The most striking piece by far is a heart-wrenching 
journal that Aguero kept in the months following her 
friend’s death. The drawings and letters in the journal 
are deeply personal and bittersweet, truly allowing 
viewers to get a glimpse into the personal struggle that 
she went through.
The exhibit is honest and pure, and the personal touches 
complete the vision. For example, cupcakes were 
provided at Friday’s opening simply because “they were 
[her friend’s] favorite food,” Aguero said.
Attention to detail, personal touches, and the interesting 
juxtaposition of a somber theme with bold colors and 
pieces makes this exhibition a thought-provoking and 
joyful success.

Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street.

The line to pick up will-call tickets at the venue was out 
the door and around the corner, and the line of people 
hoping to buy last-minute tickets was even longer — 
even with 10 minutes left before the concert was going 
to start.
When the show began, people were still rushing to their 
seats as the audience members stood and sang along to 
the music. This may sound typical for a rock concert, but 
it was somewhat unexpected for this musical group: It 
was the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) at Heinz 
Hall last Saturday.
The high attendance was in part thanks to the Carnegie 
Mellon University Night that the orchestra was hosting: 
Students, faculty, and staff received discounts on tickets.
The concert began with “The Star-Spangled Banner,” 
and once everyone was settled back into their seats, 
William Caballero, the PSO’s principal horn and an 
associate teaching professor in the School of Music, 
strode onto the stage with the conductor, PSO music 
director Manfred Honeck.
This is Caballero’s 24th year as principal horn in the 
PSO, and his experience was apparent in his rendition of 
Richard Strauss’ Concerto No. 1 in E-?at major for Horn 
and Orchestra. The French horn is usually known for its 
bold, brassy sound, but Caballero showed off the horn’s 
sweet, expressive side. At some points in the concerto, 
the horn almost sounded like the woodwind instruments 
that accompanied it.
His performance also highlighted his technical ability. 
Near the end of the concerto, Caballero picked up the 
tempo, his ?ngers ?ying over the instrument’s valves as 
he expertly made his way through a quick sequence of 
notes, ?nishing to a standing ovation.
Caballero wasn’t the only featured soloist of the evening, 
however. After a short break, Thomas Hampson — an 
American lyric baritone — took the stage to perform four 
of Strauss’ songs for baritone and orchestra.
Hampson is in high demand as an opera singer, and 
his performance showed why: He had engaging 
stage presence, with animated movements and facial 
expressions that made the emotions in the songs easy to 
understand, even though all the lyrics were in German.
While all of his songs were excellent, the highlight by 
far was “Nächtlicher Gang,” a dramatic song about 
a lover looking for his beloved beyond the grave. The 
lyrics, taken from a poem of the same name by Friedrich 
Rückert, begin, “The ?ags ?ap / In the midnight storm, / 
The slates rattle / On the church tower.”
The PSO made for a dramatic accompaniment to 
Hampson’s singing. The orchestra built up to a 
thunderous climax, then abruptly stopped, keeping the 
audience members at the edge of their seats before 
gently easing into the conclusion. The performance 
made such an impact that many in the audience were 
excitedly murmuring after the piece ?nished, even 
though Hampson still had one more song to perform.
After intermission, the orchestra took the spotlight 
with its rendition of Antonín Dvorák’s Symphony No. 
9 in E minor, more famously known as his “New World 
Symphony.” The symphony has been recorded hundreds 
of times and performed by everyone from world-class 
philharmonics to youth orchestras, to the point that, as 
an NPR article about the symphony warned, “it runs the 
risk of sounding hackneyed.”
Luckily, Dvorák’s symphony is lush and emotionally 
varied enough to overcome any worries of it becoming 
stale, and the PSO’s rendition brought out the best in the 
composition. The orchestra, under Honeck’s direction, 
teased out all the different colors and tones in each 
movement, resulting in a warm, moving performance 
that earned thunderous applause.
As part of Carnegie Mellon University Night, members 
of the university were invited to a reception after the 
concert in the basement of Heinz Hall. A crowd of 
students, faculty, and staff members gathered to eat cake 
and talk about the performance. Once most of the people 
in the crowd had started to dig into their desserts, a 
stream of Carnegie Mellon and PSO af?liates took to the 
microphone to thank everyone for coming.
The chairman of the PSO Board of Trustees, Dick 
Simmons, particularly expressed his delight at the 
presence of so many students. “We always love to see 
the average age [of audience members] go down,” he 
joked. Honeck agreed, and added that having a younger 
crowd adds more energy to the hall. “We feel when 
you are in the audience,” he said. Given the incredible 
concert that the PSO put on, it wouldn’t be surprising if 
more Carnegie Mellon students become a regular part of 
the audience for future performances.

Last week saw the return of many beloved TV dramas, 
such as Bones, and comedies like Parks and Recreation 
and The Of?ce. This week continues the plethora of 
season premieres with the return of favorites such as 
Castle, How I Met Your Mother, Grey’s Anatomy, and 
The Big Bang Theory.
Castle
Castle’s fourth season ?nale was a crowd-pleaser, with 
the romantic relationship between main characters 
NYPD detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) and mystery 
novelist Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) ?nally setting 
off. The mystery of the murder of Beckett’s mother, 
however, remains unsolved. This season promises to be 
action-packed, as Castle and Beckett try to keep their 
relationship a secret while continually investigating 
the Cole Maddox case, which is carried over from last 
season. Look out for the new season, which premieres 
tonight at 10 p.m. on ABC.
How I Met Your Mother
Today also marks the start of the comedy How I Met Your 
Mother on CBS. In a ?urry of ?ashbacks and glimpses 
into the future, the upcoming premiere will address 
some unresolved questions from the previous season. 
The seventh season ?nale ended with Barney Stinson 
(Neil Patrick Harris) at his wedding to Quinn Garvey 
(guest-star Becki Newton); Marshall Eriksen (Jason 
Segel) and Lily Aldrin (Alison Hannigan) having their 
baby; and Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) running off with his 
ex-girlfriend Victoria (guest-star Ashley Williams).
The series has won seven Emmy awards since it began 
in 2009, and has been nominated for many more. With 
rumors ?oating that this season is probably the last and 
with its previous season receiving the highest ratings of 
all, viewers anxiously wait to see how the Barney-Quinn 
wedding turns out and how Ted ?nally meets his future 
wife. Don’t miss the beginning of this promising season 
at 8 p.m.
Grey’s Anatomy
Everyone’s favorite medical drama Grey’s Anatomy 
begins its ninth season Thursday. Last season ended 
with a severe shock: A plane crash left many members 
of the cast stranded in a forest, and Lexie “Little” Grey 
(Chyler Leigh) met her end, which effectively boosted 
ratings for the show. Loyal viewers can’t wait to see how 
the others end up back in Seattle Grace Mercy West 
Hospital. As of last season, the series is the top-rated 
drama on television among its target demographic of 
ages 18–49. Although this season sees the unfortunate 
departure of Mark “McSteamy” Sloan (Eric Dane), it 
promises to bring even more drama for the rest of team. 
Grey’s Anatomy will premiere at 9 p.m. on ABC.
The Big Bang Theory
The previous season of the popular sitcom The Big Bang 
Theory ended with Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) ?nally 
making a romantic move on Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim 
Bialik), as the group watched friend and aerospace 
engineer Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) shoot off 
into space. Fans will be happy to see more of Sheldon’s 
sweet side this season. The romance continues as 
Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) and Penny (Kaley 
Cuoco) start the season off continuing their relationship 
after Hofstadter’s awkward marriage proposal last 
season. The comedy comes back this Thursday at 8 p.m. 
on CBS.

Chronicle
Saturday, Sept. 29
8 10 12
Using the “found footage” aesthetic made popular by 
movies like The Blair Witch Project and Clover?eld, 
Chronicle tells the story of a few high school students 
who develop telekinetic powers. The movie pulls from a 
variety of genres and styles, congealing into a superhero, 
sci-?, pseudo-docudrama. Chronicle works to satisfy 
fans from many different backgrounds and tastes — and 
it mostly succeeds. The ?lm is Josh Trank’s directing 
debut and features new acting talent in Dane DeHaan 
and Alex Russel.
The Amazing Spider-Man
Friday, Sept. 28
8 10 12
It’s only been a few years since the conclusion of 
director and producer Sam Raimi’s take on the 
Spiderman franchise, but why would that stop 
Hollywood from rebooting a guaranteed cash cow? 
The Amazing Spider-Man, led by director Marc Webb 
and starring Andrew Gar?eld (The Social Network) 
and Emma Stone (Easy A), turned out to be one 
of the biggest hits of the summer. Gar?eld gives a 
solid performance and, as usual, Stone is incredibly 
charming. Coming from a Hollywood of remakes and 
headaches, the movie mostly avoids redundancy and 
has some moments of inventive variation on the tiring 
superhero template.
Super
Sunday, Sept. 30
6 8 10
Super, starring Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page, plays on 
the recent popularity of powerless superheroes. The 
?lm carries some acute observations on the nature of 
loneliness and the psychosis that it can inspire. Wilson 
plays a man-child who has lived a dull life until his drug-
addicted wife leaves him for a strip club owner. He is 
then divinely inspired to pursue superheroism and teams 
up with Page to ?ght petty crime throughout the city, 
becoming a media sensation. Like Kick-Ass, a movie 
made concurrently, Super uses extreme violence and 
melodrama to draw a portrait of the geek psyche.

Ideas, like good beer, take time to perfect. Key 
components to both are the right ingredients, 
environment, and timing.
So what do you get when you combine two fraternity 
brothers with a passion for craft beer, Carnegie Mellon’s 
entrepreneurship program, and a city full of beer lovers? 
The Brew Gentlemen.
Created in 2010, The Brew Gentlemen is a Braddock-
based craft brewery that began as the brainchild of 
Carnegie Mellon 2012 alumni Asa Foster and Matt 
Katase. Foster and Katase are “The Brew Gentlemen.”
“We both lived in Morewood freshman year,” Foster 
said. “And then we both joined [Sigma Alpha Epsilon].” 
The bonds of brotherhood, as well as a feeling of 
disenchantment with their majors, brought the two 
together. Foster was an art student, while Katase was 
studying operations research.
“We were both interested in craft beer and we often 
joked around with the idea that we would create a 
brewery someday,” Foster said. “Then, the Thanksgiving 
of our junior year, Matt came to Boston for the break and 
we were sitting on the couch just watching football and 
decided to just drop everything in life and do it.”
With the craft brewery scene quickly gaining popularity, 
the pair petitioned and received permission to change 
their areas of study to a student-de?ned major. “Our 
majors were in the way of what we really wanted to 
pursue,” Katase said. In their new majors, Foster and 
Katase were allowed to take the entrepreneurship and 
marketing classes they needed to make The Brew 
Gentlemen a reality.
“We got a lot of help from entrepreneurship professors,” 
Katase said. “[Barbara] Carryer and [Robert] Culbertson, 
in particular, really helped us form the backbone of our 
company. They told us our business plan was sh*t, that 
this has to be more than just a dream, and they really got 
us to think about the speci?cs. And they’re still helping 
us to this day — which is awesome.”
Carryer, an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship in 
the Tepper School of Business, continues to coach and 
encourage the pair to focus on the business end of the 
endeavor. “I really pushed them to go out and talk to 
distributors, to restaurants and bars to see who would 
carry the beer, to make them ?gure out how a new beer 
gets to market,” Carryer said.
Culbertson — an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship 
and CEO of GetABBY, a consumer communication 
platform — also lent some hard-hitting advice to the 
young businessmen. “I got pissed off at them in one 
class,” Culbertson said. “To the point of saying, ‘Would 
you just get off the pot already and do it?’ I told them 
they were making some stupid decisions, and oftentimes 
I kind of embarrassed them in front of the class. But 
that really made them get off the pot and start doing 
something.”
“[Robert] is a tough-love kind of guy,” Katase said. “But 
we got past that.” As part of an apprentice project 
Culbertson conducts in one of his classes, Foster 
and Katase started throwing dinner and beer-tasting 
parties for friends, peers, and individuals involved in 
Pittsburgh’s craft beer scene.
“For our ?rst event,” Foster said, “we put on a four-course 
beer dinner cooked entirely by us and featured our White 
Sky alongside three other beers.”
“We’re both foodies; we love cooking and mixing ideas 
and ingredients,” Foster said. “So making nontraditional 
beers like our White Sky is what we want to be doing.” 
The White Sky is The Brew Gentlemen’s ?agship beer, 
and it has received positive feedback in the brew 
community. It’s a wheat beer brewed with chai spices

like cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and black 
pepper.
The beer’s spicy taste, combined with the lightness of 
the wheat, makes it a “year-round seasonal,” as The 
Brew Gentlemen call it. White Sky is a good winter beer 
because of its warmth and spiciness, but it also works as 
a summer beer because of its light and refreshing taste.
“I actually hired them to provide the beer for a party that 
I gave in the middle of August,” Carryer said. “It was 
really great beer, and all my friends — about 50 people — 
really liked the beer, too. Super enthusiastic response.”
The duo has also created a beer called Business Casual, 
a caramel-colored session red ale, and revived General 
Braddock’s IPA, a bittersweet East Coast India pale ale.
“Part of our agreement with [Barbara] is that we have to 
come in and talk to her students once we’re successful,” 
Katase said. “... and bring beer.”
Carryer wasn’t alone in her praise of The Brew 
Gentlemen’s products. “It’s good beer,” Culbertson said. 
“If they had it in a restaurant, I would absolutely order it. 
I think they could sell their stuff tomorrow.”
Culbertson advised the duo to take advantage of the 
growing interest in craft beer and to get their product on 
the market as soon as possible. “Right now the window 
for craft beers is huge,” Culbertson said. “Everybody 
wants a craft beer and they don’t care so much if they 
have to pay six bucks a bottle for it, and I don’t want 
them to miss that window.”
The Brew Gentlemen already have some prospective 
restaurants and bars wanting to buy their beer, but 
the pair is waiting to perfect and test its recipes before 
of?cially opening for business.
“I think there’s another hurdle to get over, which is how 
they will handle demand,” Culbertson said. “We are all 
fearful of failure — there’s no question about that — but 
we’re also fearful of success.”
“Every entrepreneur wonders, ‘Gee, what happens if 
I suddenly get orders for 1,000 kegs, what do I do?’ ” 
Culbertson said. “The new entrepreneur always reacts, 
‘Oh my god, I’m done, I’m doomed.’ I sit here and say, 
‘Hey, time to throw a party! Wow, people want 1,000 
kegs of your beer? Holy crap! That’s a great problem!’ 
But when you’re living it, all you can see is the logistics: 
How are we gonna deliver it, how are we gonna brew 
that much by that time, et cetera. It goes back to the 
dating analogy, ‘She invited me to the prom. Oh my god. 
Oh my god, I’ve gotta rent a tux.’ ”
Although The Brew Gentlemen undoubtedly have some 
hurdles in their future, things are looking good from their 
Braddock facility. “Braddock is the perfect backdrop for 
a brewery,” Foster said. “It’s quiet and we’re right in the 
backyard of the steel mill.”
Their establishment, which is about 3,000 square feet 
and currently houses their production facility and pilot 
brewing system, is owned by the Heritage Community 
Initiatives. “The mayor [of Braddock] and the Heritage 
Community Initiatives — a nonpro?t that’s trying to 
revitalize Braddock — really helped us ?nd our space,” 
Katase said.
Foster and Katase are surprised by the amount 
of support they have received from the Braddock 
and brewing communities. “The cooperation and 
willingness of other breweries to lend a hand has been 
overwhelming,” Katase said. “From just giving us 
feedback on our beer to letting us borrow equipment to 
just teaching us anything and everything we want to 
learn.”
“Everyone is extremely willing to pour you a beer,” 
Katase added. “Because, really, the competitors are the 
big three: Bud, Miller, and Coors. The craft guys are 
all in this together, and they wanna see each other do 
well because, what is that saying, ‘Rising tides ?oat all 
boats?’ ”
Since their ?rst dinner party in April, The Brew 
Gentlemen have been invited to and have attended a 
number of other beer dinners and tastings, the biggest 
of which will be held on Oct. 6 in Braddock. The event, 
“Tapped: Braddock,” will feature a pop-up beer garden 
provided by The Brew Gentlemen, cocktails from Bar 
Marco, local food trucks, and live local music.
“We’ll be pouring the White Sky and the General 
Braddock’s,” Foster said. “And there’ll be a pig roast by 
Kevin Sousa [owner of Salt of the Earth], who’s opening a 
restaurant above our brewery. He’s a resident badass, so 
that’s gonna be awesome.”
The Brew Gentlemen plan to open their facility to the 
public early next year, where they will have beers on tap.

A screening and release party of the DVD and 
book Strange Attractors: Investigations in 
Non-Humanoid Extraterrestrial Sexualities — a 
project dedicated to exploring extraterrestrial 
sexual desires — took place on Friday night at 
the Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ Melwood Screening 
Room.
Seventy different artists collaborated on the 
project, all of them contributing through various 
mediums, including visual art, creative writing, 
and video. Those involved in the project made 
an effort to do away with conventional sexual 
boundaries, moving far beyond binary thinking 
and attempting to conceptualize all the dirty 
details of extraterrestrial pleasure.
Suzie Silver, an associate professor of art at 
Carnegie Mellon who spearheaded this project, 
claims that Strange Attractors has a “huge 
CMU presence.” She estimates that nearly half 
of the project is made up of Carnegie Mellon 
af?liates, and that about two-thirds of the video 
contributors were her students at one point.
In 2009, Silver founded the Institute of 
Extraterrestrial Sexuality, inspired by 
a combination of her love of sci-?, her 
longstanding interest in gender expression and 
sexuality, and the launching of the Kepler Space 
Telescope in March of that year. Her efforts, 
united with those of Encyclopedia Destructica 
— a community-based artist book publisher that 
started as a student project at Carnegie Mellon 
— and those of the eclectic group of artistic 
contributors, all acted together to provide this 
unique insight into sexual imagination.
At the screening last Friday, the audience 
congregated in the lobby before the show. 
Waiters in outrageous alien costumes that 
blinked and sparkled carried trays of strangely 
phosphorescent jello shots. Audience members 
sported striking styles: half-shaven heads, bold 
facial piercings, ample facial hair, black leather 
pants, and sophisticated silk vests.

Carnegie Mellon pairs up with Disney 
to conduct research for CGI-animated 
films regarding eye blinks. The research 
includes asking subjects to rate which 
eye blinks they find most natural and 
working on different algorithms to 
improve how realistic animators are 
able to make their characters.
The screening itself was composed of selected videos 
from the DVD, as well as readings from the book. Silver, 
sporting what looked like an alien space helmet, read 
passages from her work. As the screening continued, 
the audience was shocked, confused, and intrigued. 
But throughout it all, there was a deeper underlying 
message. “Imagine and empathize with others who are 
really, really different from you,” Silver explained. “If you 
can do that, then maybe you can empathize and tolerate 
people that might be just a little bit different from you.”
The success of this project should be encouraging to 
any student at Carnegie Mellon who desires to embark 
on a journey that may be a little out-of-the-box. “No idea 
is too weird,” said Scott Andrew, a Carnegie Mellon art 
graduate student and video contributor to the project, 
on the amount of resources available to students. The 
group behind Strange Attractors was able to raise about 
$24,000 for the project from various sources, such as the 
Heinz Foundation and Kickstarter. 
The creativity of these artists and their determination 
to see their project through to the end, no matter how 
odd or eccentric it may appear, is truly inspirational. As 
Silver put it: “Are we just gonna let whatever happens 
happen? Or are we going to try to imagine, and actively 
participate in, creating a world of our dreams?”
