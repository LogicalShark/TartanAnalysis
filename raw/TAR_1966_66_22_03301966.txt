Deferment Based On 
Need, Class StandingAdministration Announces
Womens9 Regulations
In answer to the recent housing proposals made by women students, the Administration has decided that 
Colonial Manor and *E" Tower apartments will be available to all senior and junior women regardless of 
cumulative average.
The Association of Women Students will arrange the priority system to be used in apartment assignments. 
The priority system, however, is not to have any arbitrary cutoff point in the form of a required cumulative 
average.
Since the beginning of the Viet­
nam buildup in the summer of 1965, 
it has seemed increasingly likely 
that an indeterminate number of 
students would have to be induct­
ed.
The current regulations govern­
ing student deferment are the fol­
lowing: 1622.25 Class II-S: Regis­
trant Deferred Because of Activi­
ty in Study — (a) In Class II-S 
shall be placed any registrant 
whose activity in study is found 
to be necessary to the mainten­
ance of the national health, safe­
ty, or interest, (b) The Director 
of Selective Service, after con­
sultation with such departments 
and other agencies of the execu­
tive branch of the Government 
as may be appropriate, may pro­
mulgate criteria, which shall be 
advisory only, concerning the pla­
cing of registrants in Class n-S.
Advisory criteria similar to 
those used during the Korean con­
flict, making use of rank in class 
and a score on the recently announ­
ced College Qualification Test, are 
likely soon to be promulgated by 
Selective Service to the local 
boards. It is not mandatory that 
local boards defer students who 
meet the advisory criteria. Never­
theless, it seems probable that the 
more complete, prompt, and pre­
cise the information furnished the 
better served will be the interests 
of students and the local boards.
Draft Testing
It is assumed that students in 
good standing currently enrolled 
for the 1965 - 66 school year will 
be allowed to finish the year. 
Depending on the need for manpow­
er for the armed forces, those 
with the best potential for further 
education will be deferred for 1966- 
67, while those whose records 
measure up less well will be con­
sidered eligible for military ser­
vice.
During the Korean period rank 
in class or test score, whichever 
was higher, was used as a basis 
for determining further defer­
ment, this alternative approach 
will most likely be reinstituted. 
In the absence of information, lo­
cal boards will have to make their 
judgments on the basis of whatever 
information, from whatever sour­
ces, they can secure.
School Reports
At the request of their students 
educational institutions will be ex­
pected to make the following types 
of reports to local Selective Ser­
vice boards:
1. A report of acceptance for 
admission, rendered when the stu­
dent has been accepted, prior to 
the opening of the school year.
2. A report at the beginning of 
the year indicating that the stu­
dent has begun the school year and 
is satisfactorily pursuing a full­
time course of instruction, the col­
lege year of the student, the be­
ginning and ending dates of the 
school year, and the expected date 
of graduation of the student. It is 
understood, that when a student 
asks the institution to file a status 
report, he recognizes the obliga­
tion of a college or university to 
inform the draft board when he is 
no longer enrolled full-time, is in­
eligible to continue his course of 
study, or has graduated.
3. An end of the year report, 
showing the scholastic standing of 
the student for the year with re­
spect to the full-time male stu­
dents in his class, by the foilow-
ing categories: upper one-fourth, 
upper one-half, upper two-thirds, 
upper three-fourths, and lower 
one-fourth. For graduate and post 
bacclaaureate professional stu­
dents, the end of the year report 
would not show class standing, 
but only satisfactory or unsatisfa­
ctory progress for the year.
In order to justify a claim for 
deferment on the part of qualified 
students, the institutions must be 
equally candid in reporting unsa­
tisfactory progress on the part of 
others.
A student certified as carry­
ing a “full-time course of instruc­
tion” is one carrying enough work 
to qualify himself for graduation 
in the usual length of time. The 
commonly employed definitions of 
“full-time student,’* although use­
ful in other contexts, are often mi­
nimum loads which will not bring 
a student to his degree on time. 
Institutions may need to re-study 
their concepts of the full-time stu­
dent and length of time normally 
required by their students for 
graduation, when reporting student 
progress to Selective Service.
Class Standing
Class standing may be calculat­
ed by the institution in any way 
it chooses. It may be based on 
cumulative grades or yearly gra­
des. It may be determined insti­
tution-wide, by school within an in­
stitution, by department, or in any 
other way that appears to be use­
ful. However, the number of stu­
dents certified to be in a parti­
cular segment of a class should 
not exceed the total number of that 
segment.
For example, no more than 50 
per cent of the total number of stu­
dents in a class may be certified 
as being in the upper half. Ties in 
class standing must be broken by 
the institution when several stu­
dents apparently have the same 
rank.
Reporting student progress to 
Selective Service will require 
extra clerical effort on the part 
of colleges and universities. But 
the Selective Service System 
must have information on which to 
make its judgments.
Students View 
Pop Problem
A conference discussing “World 
Population and its Effect on My 
Individual Anonymity” will beheld 
at American University in Wash­
ington D.C. from April 1 to 3.
Under the sponsorship of the 
Student YMCA-YWCA of the Middle 
Atlantic Region, experts on world 
population from government and 
private agencies will be available 
for interviews by teams of four to 
five students. Housing will be ar­
ranged at the Key Bridge Marriott 
Motor Hotel, and transportation is 
being worked out from Pittsburgh 
for Carnegie Tech and Pitt stu­
dents Interested in attending.
TTiere will be financial help 
for those who are members of the 
YMCA or YWCA, but non-mem­
bers are also encouraged to at­
tend.
Further Information may be ob­
tained at the Y-office, Skibo, room 
57 and reservations will have to be 
In by March 30.
Committee Has 
“Great” Plans 
For Carnival
This year’s Spring Car­
nival 66 will be held on May 
6 and 7, culminating weeks 
of work by the dormitories 
and fraternities on their 
midway booths and buggies.
And the entertainment planned 
for this year has been summed up 
in one word by carnival commit­
tee members, “great.”
Friday night’s concert will fea­
ture the New Christy Minstrels 
and will be held at the Carnegie 
Music Hall. At the Saturday night 
dance in Skibo, music will be fur­
nished by the Kingsmen.
The New Christy Minstrels have 
performed at such schools as Stan­
ford, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Nor­
thwestern, Miami of Ohio, and S. 
M.U.
The nine Minstrels shared bill­
ings with Henry Mancini and Dinah 
Shore, and won an Academy Award 
for their song “Chim Chi Che- 
ree.” In 1963 they won the San 
Remo Music Festival, and in 1964 
the best vocal group award given 
by Billboard Magazine.
The Minstrels’ show at the White 
House for President Johnson and 
President Segni of Italy, prompt­
ed Segni to say, “It is a type of 
music Europe should know more 
about.” A year later the group 
went on tour to Holland, Denmark, 
Sweden, Norway, Italy, France, 
Belgium, Germany and England.
Later they went to Russia to 
perform in Moscow.
The Kingsmen have played at 
colleges all over the United Sta­
tes and are known for such songs 
as “Louie Louie,” “Long Green,” 
“Long Tall Texan” and “Jolly 
Green Giant.”
Tickets for the Spring Carnival 
week-end will be sold in Baker 
Hall lobby and in the bookstore 
after Easter vacation.
AWS Elections
Election of new officers of the 
Association of Women Students 
(AWS) will be held today, tomor­
row and Friday.
Any girl who has participated in 
the AWS Council or Judiciary Com­
mittee for one semester is eligible 
for an office.
Commuters can vote In Dean 
Milligan’s office, BH148, and dorm 
students can vote at the Morewood 
Gardens main desk.
Students will also vote for the 
ratification of the new AWS consti­
tution, which will be available at 
both voting posts.
The constitution, if passed, will 
be in effect beginning September, 
1966.
THISTLE GITCHA
Congress
Reps. Suggest 
SkiboChanges
Student Union facilities and the 
organization of next year’s Con­
gress were discussed at the March 
22 meeting of Student Congress.
It was suggested that the union 
include a barber shop, shoe re­
pair, laundry, bowling alleys, pool 
tables, telephones, photostat ma­
chines, and book store-drug store 
and other improvements.
It was also announced that a 
campus bulletin will probably be 
erected as soon as the area around 
the temporary circular sidewalk 
is cleared up.
An amendment to the constitution 
was proposed which, among other 
things, will decrease the size of 
next year’s Congress by cutting 
out departmental representatives.
An outline for next year’s Con­
gress election included an all­
campus election for the president 
and vice-president. These articles 
will be discussed at the next Stu­
dent Congress meeting.
Library Holds 
Service Info
The establishment of a Selective 
Service Military Opportunity re­
serve section in the Hunt Library 
has been announced by the Division 
of Student Affairs.
This section will contain the 
most up-to-date Selective Ser­
vice Procedure Manual, material 
covering any and all programs 
that the Armed Forces have to of­
fer college students, and opportu­
nities for government service 
other than military which offer 
deferment.
Military Opportunity informa­
tion from the five branches of the 
Armed Forces is now available. 
Current literature in the Armed 
Forces reserve programs and the 
latest U.S. Government Military 
Office information covering Selec­
tive Service is on shipment.
With the help of the Dean of 
Men’s Office and the reference 
staff in the library, this infor­
mation will be kept up-to-date 
on a weekly basis.
Scimitar Applications
Any male freshman with a 2.75 
and above factor who did not re­
ceive an application from Sci­
mitars, the sophomore men’s ho­
norary, should obtain one at the 
information desk in Skibo.
Applications are to be sent to 
Bob Rose, Box 209 by April 1. 
Because of difficulties with cam­
pus mail, not all of the applica­
tions which were sent out have 
been received. -----
Parental permission will be re­
quired for any student who de­
sires an apartment.
As in existing policy, male visi­
tors will not be allowed in “E” 
Tower apartments.
At Colonial Manor there will 
be a Staff or Faculty couple and 
a superintendent and wife.
Visiting Hours
Male visitors at Colonial Man­
or may be entertained Sunday 
through Thursday from 10 a.m. 
until 12:30 a.m. and on Friday and 
Saturday from 10 a.m. until 1:30
a.m.
The AWS will be responsible 
for developing a program which 
will insure enforcement of male 
visiting rules and other matters 
which it considers relevant. Such 
a program will have as its object­
ives the assurance of acceptable 
study conditions, privace, and pro­
tection of the tenants.
The Administration also approv­
ed that Open House at Morewood 
Gardens may be observed three 
or four times per year on the same 
basis as in the past. The Admi­
nistration is also prepared to con­
sider improvement and expansion 
of existing dormitory lounges to 
furnish acceptable entertainment 
facilities.
Flexible Program
Stated George K. Brown, dean 
of student affairs, “For a number 
of years Carnegie has been inte­
rested in developing a flexible or 
graduated housing program for wo­
men. We were able to initiate this 
program last spring when the Hon­
or Tower and off-campus permis­
sion for certain girls were approv­
ed. The objective of a graduated 
system is to give the greatest 
amount of variety and flexibility. 
In this way, the housing desires of 
the greatest number of students 
will be satisfied.”
Colonial Manor represents the 
step or phase next to living off the 
campus completely. Only light su­
pervision will be given the faci­
lity.
“E” Tower apartments offer 
greater flexibility to the senior 
or junior women than regular dor­
mitory accommodations. In these 
apartments a girl will have more 
privacy, and will be able to meet 
her personal food desires, since 
she will not be required to parti­
cipate in the Morewood Gardens 
board contract.
Dean Brown added that “since 
it is uncertain as to how much re­
sponsibility the students will as­
sume, decisions in such matters 
as the subject onnes are exper­
imental and subject to review and 
change depending upon their suc­
cess in the Mure.

All male students under the jur­
isdiction of Selective Service are

on Selective Service in the gym­
nasium tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.

in addition to their massive work

is unfair to inflict so many pres­
sures upon our students. If we ex­
pect then to derive the fullest 
benefit from their education, we 
cannot expect them to earn sub­
sistance money as well.”
The Administration has also de­
cided to increase the number of 
scholarships available to stu­
dents. Again, the campus mav be 
short-changed because of this, 
as the construction of the new ad­
ministration building will probably 
come to a halt. “The student must 
decide what is most important to 
him,” stated the President, 
“greenery or greenbacks.”
New Scholarships will be based 
on athletic ability and draft status, 
concurrent with financial need.
Because Carnegie Tech is so 
poorly endowed, it will be neces­
sary to eliminate such plans as new 
tennis courts, new parking fa­
cilities, and new teacher and ad­
ministrative lounges in order to 
insure placement for all the finan­

Drafted!
The Search for Understanding 
came io an official close early 
Saturday, when the author was 
dragged into the Army Special For­
ces Guerilla and Frogman Unit 
(ASFGFUX The author will be 
trained as a frogman and will be 
used in the upcoming secret am* 
phlbious attack on North Vietnam 
by the United States. The Secre­
tary of Offense has indicated that 
well trained frogmen are super­
ior to submarines in so far as “our 
fighting men will follow orders, no 
matter how senseless they may be, 
while submarines often think for 
themselves.”
The author was motivated pri­
marily by his draft board. Late 
Friday evening, two sweet old la­
dies from Local Board number 
76 42 descended upon the Carne­
gie Tech campus in search of 
him. These matrons of Ameri­
can womanhood knocked upon the 
door of the wrong fraternity house.
Several hours and many beers 
later, the old ladies finally stag­
gered through (literally) the right 
door. One pledge politely invited 
the two old ladies down to the bar 
and a brother quickly informed the 
ladies that the Carnegie Tech re­
cord dance was across the street. 
However, they were fiercely de­
termined to get their man.
Upon sighting the author, they 
screamed: “Upon General Her-
shey, that great honorable man, 
we stand - and call forth you to 
serve your country as a man.” 
The author quietly indicated that 
the DAR might be able to acquire 
a room in Skibo for their next 
meeting, and this somewhat paci­
fied them. The author was present­
ed with a recording of the “Green 
Beret” as an indication of what he 
should aspire to.
Since the author has an inhe­
rent tendency to moralize, he 
couldn’t pass up an opportunity 
such as this. As he began his frog­
man training early this week, he 
remarked: “this was an odd way 
for understanding to end, if it had 
actually ever begun. Understand­
ing never will end if it has once 
begun — its roots cling too strong­
ly to the individual. This is a new 
beginning for me — even an ob­
stacle may serve as an impetus 
to greater understanding. Under­
standing is essential to life.”
In his frogman suit, he resem­
bled a foreign being. American, 
Chinese, Russian or Vietnamese — 
one could not be sure. Identity 
is non-existent in war — war al­
ways destroys one’s identity. The 
author will lose his identity; his 
path to understanding will not on­
ly be blocked, it will be erased.
Thank you, General Hershey, 
wherever you may be.

University’s Nature
Tech Puddles Of Power
by Charles Trammel
Let us consider a puddle
A puddle on campus.
A puddle in everyone’s road.
Note the attitude of those imme­
diately affected.
Here comes an engineer. He be­
comes angry because no one 
has built something to walk over.
Here comes a Fine Arts Student. 
He pauses to reflect upon the 
puddle, then walks through it, 
savoring the experience.
Here comes a math major. How do 
you define a puddle?
Here comes a Maggie Murph. She 
has a date tonight. She doesn’t 
see the muddle.
The faculty avoid the area, as it 
is irritating.
The Administration doesn’t know 
about it yet, but someday the 
students will tell them.
Or will they?
Then the Administration will act.

Spots Spread
Workers Keep 
Walkway Ther
Carnegie Tech civil engineers, 
in the guise of construction work­
ers, have been helping to main­
tain the campus sidewalks this 
winter.
Smiling warmly at the pass­
ing young ladies and whispering 
complimentary quips, they have 
laid the wooden planks and re­
moved them — just in time for the 
night -1 ibr ar y-w al ker s.
“Da. It’s been lotsa fun,” said 
engineer, Tom Glass. He did com­
plain, however, that the motorcy­
cle boots and Cuban heels wore 
down the plywood faster than he 
could supply it. He also mention­
ed a “kinda” British element pre­
valent on campus. “Dem there 
Beatle-Boys should be on TV,” 
he decided.
With regard to the recently pa­
ved formerly flexible walkway, ci­
vil engineers explained that such 
a by-pass was necessary to avoid 
the sewage ditch. A bridge would 
have been too difficult to construct.
An Itch
Along with the seasonable spring 
weather have come the spots and 
their accompanying itches. These 
have caused many dexterous con­
taminants to stop, stand and 
scratch in attempts to alleviate 
their tickles.
At present, the measles have 
invaded every floor at Morewood 
Gardens and within three weeks 
they should have been welcomed 
by all residents.
“What measles epidemic?” the 
nurse asked a distraught, polka- 
dotted resident the other day. Ap­
parently, most of the check­
erboard faces have remained hid­
den for a three day self-inflicted 
quarantine.
Thoughtfully, they attempt to 
forget about their own discom­
forts and sympathize with those 
people infected by them the day 
before. “Poor Jane, I put on her 
makeup just seven hours ago when 
I was highly contagious . . . and 
that salesgirl in Coughmans.”
As for the disease, it runs 
its course (from head to arms 
to belly to legs) and disappears 
after a three-day visitation. It 
is not dangerous in most cases 
but it does keep one constantly 
stimulated — to itch the spots 
that scratch.

Something’s Afoul
Recently, Carnegie Tech students have been sub­
jected to some surprises regarding the weather: one 
day they were walking around campus in shorts; the 
next, they were shielding their faces from the snow. 
These drastic fluctuations in the weather situation at 
Carnegie Tech have caused considerable criticism by 
students about the impropriety with which the weather 
administration has been functioning.
The root of this problem stems from the disgrace­
ful lack of communication between the students and the 
administration. To cite one illustration, an attempt 
was made earlier this year to poll the students con­
cerning their attitude toward changing the weather 
calendar such that bad weather would end by Christmas 
and spring would start early in January, with the con­
comitant effect of summer beginning in April. The 
overwhelming student response, however, was reject­
ed by the faculty, which maintained that the good wea­
ther in January would effectively prevent students 
from engaging in their requisite academic pursuits. 
The greatest dissension, moreover, came from the 
proponents of the view that semester-end storms are 
beneficial in that they cause deeper student apprecia - 
tion of the previous semester’s weather.
In an attempt to end the deadlock resulting from 
this controversy, the responsibility of controlling the 
weather was then assigned to a committee of Student 
Congress, which, after a four month study, arrived at 
the inescapable conclusion that insufficient funds had 
been allocated by the Congress to permit the commit­
tee to perform adequately its task.
Among the multifarious consequences of this de­
plorable mismanagement was a violent riot, staged 
by 4000 angry, misinformed students in front of the so- 
called Baker Hall. The insurrection was quelled when 
the oligarchy, backed by a squad of bulldozers, forced 
the inciters of chaos into the ditches, which were so 
thoughtfully provided by the construction workers for 
the drainage of water which resulted from torrential 
rains on the cut.
As if this were not enough, the foul weather has
also slowed to a virtual halt the construction work on
the Dramatic Arts Center, because of the reallocation oi some *0 mimun to computer research m weathercontrol.
Such lackadaisical handling of this situation cannot 
be tolerated; the unkempt state of the constitution 
of the weather administration must be ameliorated, 
the encroachment upon student autonomy for control 
of the weather must be ended, and the authority to act 
placed in the hands of the proper agency, the Tartan.

The Tartan is sponsoring the 
“Ugliest Female On Campus” con­
test in cooperation with The Pitts­
burgh - Dally - Sun - Journal -. 
Herald magazine section.
The campus-wide election for 
finalists will be held next Wednes­
day after dark by the senior fence. 
The contestants have agreed to this 
arrangement as they have been 
receiving complaints from resi­
dents of the Carnegie Tech 
Community that certain individuals 
have been “scared half out of their 
minds" by the “ghoolish" contest 
participants.
Pictures of the “beauties" have 
not as yet appeared in the Tar­
tan because our readers are not 
prepared for such a shock “treat" 
having just completed midterm 
examinations.
The “Ugliest Female On Cam­
pus" contest has become‘a tradi­
tion among the “lovely ladies" 
who attend class at Carnegie Tech.
Last year's “winner," Dis 
Grace Full, will be all hands in 
the crowning of this year's selec-. 
tion. The crowning will take place! 
at Greek Fling in the Where Whati 
Room of the “student union."
There is apparently a renewed 
interest in draft-card burning and 
Troika extends an invitation to the 
fainthearted to join in.
Now you too can join in. Now you 
too can burn your draft card.
Those of you with a flair for 
the grand gesture can now shine 
that little light of yours with no 
fear of recrimination or penalty. 
Note that this card makes no dis­
crimination with regard to sex and 
enables you girls who heretofore 
could only sing and march along 
to take a more active part.
Follow these simple instructions 
guarantees a successful demon­
stration of your dubious loyalties.
1. Cut you the card.
2. Fill in appropriate data.
3. Climb on a table or chair 
preferably in the presence of a 
crowd.
4. Deliver a tedious two-hour 
speech on “Peace in our time."
5. Light the card while singing 
“this little light of mine.”
6. Your 1-A reclassification 
should arrive within two weeks.
With Apologies 
To Audubon
Editor, the Tartan:
High up in a filthy gutter 
Suddenly there is a flutter 
Falling toward me comes a poi­
soned 
Mass I can't Ignore
Will I ever find I'm able 
To walk as if not in a stable 
Carrying germs up to the cradle 
Sullying the household floor — 
QUOTH THE PIGEONS-NEVER- 
MORE
Hosing down is not the answer 
Here's a mess that spreads like 
cancer
Causing students to make answer 
by playing 
Hopscotch through the door.
Mania Moves 
Onto Campus
The skate mania has swept over 
Carnegie Tech campus.
In the foggy morning amid slee­
py yawns is heard the thunder of 
roller skates and skate boards, 
attesting to athletic prowess even 
at the tiring hour of 8:30 a.m.
Across the cut, through the 
streets, and circling behind the 
Hamerschlag and Porter Hall skate 
masses of crazed students, for­
getting all in a mad, mad, mad, 
mood of skatehood.
But this exhibitionism is not 
without its consequences. Now a 
new frenzy has resulted from the 
old one. It's the craze of ace 
bandages, limping, and cautious 
slow walking. It can be surmised 
that Carnegie Tech students just 
aren't as young as they used to be. 
But with age, they grow more vul­
nerable to madness.
Who can predict what will next 
dominate campus life?
Alumni Wins 
Engineers’ Award

Tarquans Go-Go
in Water Show
Members of synchronized swimming club execute tricky on-shore maneu­
ver in •‘co-ed*’ routine.
The “Tarquans”, W.A.A.’s synchronized swimming 
club, staged their annual water ballet last Friday and 
Saturday evenings in the Tech Pool.
“H-2-O-a-Go-Go,” this year’s production, was 
viewed by over a hundred spectators, including many 
parents and faculty members from other schools who 
had come to Tech to attend a physical education con­
ference.
Bathed in shimmering colored 
lights (as well as water), fifteen 
Tarquan girls performed tradi­
tional water ballet sequences and 
also a few numbers to rock and roll 
music.
One of the aquatic dances re­
quired the women to swim about 
with candles attached to their 
heads. Frances McCabe and Ei 
leen Morrow (who was elected 
president of Tarquans for next 
year) swam solos, and Marilyn 
Walsh did a co-ed routine with 
Frank Grisnik. Grisnik, Jim Hut­
ton, and Ted McMichael were male 
participants in the show, although 
they are not regular members of 
W.A.A.
At the end of the show Miss 
Jane Fisk, girls’ P.E. instructor 
and coordinator of Tarquans, was 
thrown into the pool. Miss Fisk, 
who has run Tarquans for fifteen
years, was nevertheless pleased 
with the performance of the girls.
Cratsley, Kalin,
Morrison Make 
All-District Team
Twenty-two local college bas­
ketball coaches, voting for the 
Pittsburgh Press’s All-District 
small college basketball team, 
elected Tech mentor Mel Cratsley 
“Coach of the Year” and named 
Ray Morrison and Jeff Kalin to the 
second and third all-star teams, 
respectively. Players from Tech’s 
opponents who received mention 
were Dorn DiMattia of Geneva and 
Jeff Claypool of Grove City on the 
second team, and John Fontanella 
of Westminster on the third team.
Frank Throws In The Towel; 
Hay Named As Successor
Last week the Athletic Department finally 
announced a successor to the well-known and 
heretofore-indispensible Frank Towel, who is 
retiring at the end of this term. He is Piqua 
Baila Hay, a Carnegie Tech alumnus and former 
softball pitcher for the original Civil Hammers.
Many members of the Admini­
stration had feared that the phy­
sical education program would de­
teriorate badly when Frank Towel 
left, but they believe they found 
have an equally good man in Hay.
Hay {dans to uphold all the fine 
traditions of towelsmanship and 
showerroomsmanship established 
by Towel.
He will keep the shower room 
windows open at all times and clear 
the shower stalls promptly at twen­
ty past the hour.
“And never,” promises Hay,
“never will anyone take the bot-
tom towel In the stack.” p,’"a Bo,l<' Ho>f
AAU Preps
Tartans For 
Track Opener
Preparing for their first regu­
lar meet this Saturday, members 
of the Carnegie Tech track team 
showed well against stiff compe­
tition in the AAU senior indoor 
championships at South Park last 
week.
Senior Chris Macosko took sec­
ond in the 1000 yard run, four- 
tenths of a second behind West 
Virginia’s Bill Eadle. Eadle, who 
has turned 1:56 in the 880, clock­
ed 2:23.5. Macosko also came 
back with a 9;36 for third place 
in the two mile race. Freshman 
Eric Levine clocked a fine 10:10 
for sixth place. Levine had not 
broken 11:00 before coming to 
Tech.
Middle distance strong man, Ken 
Batorski, saw a gold medal disap­
pear in a cloud of dust on the last 
curve of the 600 yard run. Bator­
ski ran a strategic race, keeping 
two or three yards behind the lead­
ers. Kicking strong off the last 
curve with 40 yards to the tape, 
Batorski made his move to pass 
but caught the lead man’s heel and 
both went sprawling on the dusty 
track.
Another freshman, Ken Happach, 
won a bronze medal with 5’10” in 
the high jump. The Tech team ar­
rived after the event had started 
and Happach was allowed only one 
jump at 5*8” and then went to 5* 
10”.This Saturday at i:3u p.m. intne 
Tech Bowl the outdoor season 
opens against the Jeannette Har­
riers track club. They took several 
AAU medals in the field events and 
should prove good competition.
WAA Woman 
Hold Tourney
A WAA basketball invitational 
intercollegiate tournament was 
held at Carnegie Tech on Saturday, 
March 26.
The teams which participated 
were from Slippery Rock, Waynes- 
burg, East Liberty, Seton Hall, St. 
Francis and Carnegie Tech. There 
was a combined team, whose mem­
bers came from the aforemen­
tioned schools and a team compos­
ed of Tech athletic advisors. Each 
team played seven games. Slip­
pery Rock was victorious. The ad­
visors won second place. Carnegie 
Tech, heating Waynesburg, came 
in second from last place.
During intermission, three kil­
tie pipers were entertained in the 
gym. Elaine Bykowski, sophomore 
biology, managed most of the pro­
ceedings.
High School Grid Star 
To Enroll At Tech
Ralph Hardinsky, All-State football star from Ali- 
quippa High School, has announced that he plans to en­
roll at Carnegie Tech this fall. Hardinsky, who stands 
six foot seven and weighs 290 pounds (see picture) play­
ed fullback at Aliquippa. He is only the eighth player 
in Pennsylvania high school football history to score 
more points on the gridiron in one season than on 
his College Boards, and the first such athlete to at­
tend any college other than Ohio State University or 
the University of Pittsburgh.
Wednesday, March 30, 1966 - CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN - Page 3
Hardinsky graduated from Ali­
quippa on the Industrial Arts pro­
gram (wood shop option) and plans 
to major in Physics at Tech.
That should be easy for me,” 
says Hardinsky, “ ‘cause when was» c liiilo kid my Mom u»t?u 
to make me take a good physic 
every day.”
Tech coach Joe Gasparella says 
he may use Ralph on the defen­
sive line next year as well as in 
the offensive backfield. Hardin­
sky is the first football player re­
cruited by Gasparella under his 
new, expanded recruiting budget. 
The coach commented, “He was 
really impressed when I brought 
him into town and took him to din-
Hardinsky's impressive size is 
evident in this photo of him 
shaking hands with six-foot-two 
opponent.
ner at Gino’s and Pete’s.” Hie 
young scholar-athlete also liked 
the cheerful, homey dorms at Tech 
and “all the wild girls,” but what 
really sold him on CIT was the 
fact that he could remain in the 
Pittsburgh area and watch PaulAiMcr oiwgt’D
on Channel 4 every evening.
If the Stooges should go off the 
air next winter, as has been ru­
mored, wouldn’t Tech be in dan­
ger of losing Hardinsky through 
transfer to another school? 
“Well,” answered coach Gaspa­
rella, “we’re really not too wor­
ried about that, since after his 
first semester at Tech is over 
he’ll sort of be free to go where­
ver he pleases anyway.”

Tonigtii We Saw
A Swinging Party;
The Hustler, & The Raven
I pocketed the five bucks I borrowed and breezed into Morewood twen­
ty minutes late for my date. I quickly picked up the wall phone and slowly 
hui^ it down. My date was sick! As I made it to the door, some guy 
breezed in and said; “Hey Boris where you goin, out?" I smiled. 
His smile was broader, so I left.
What was he going to do?
There it was, Saturday night, five bucks in my pocket, roaring to 
move; no place to go! I’d been bagged like a cow on the way to be a wal­
let. It was then I saw my friend D.L. on the way to a swinging party. 
When we stepped out of the cab, I had four bucks, and something to do. 
At a swinging party!
A lavish house with soft colored lights and soft colored jazz. Dozens 
of different people sitting around with the same expression on their faces. 
“Pm having a good time. Aren’t I?” They weren’t; neither was I. 
D.L. and I left.
What will he do now?
D.L. and I passed a bar. “Lets get socked.” I smiled at his new 
phrase. “O.K., D.L. lets get socked!” I walked inside and two dol­
lars later I said, “Hey, D.L., , , ” He turned to me and; “Tonight 
Bob, for you, I’m just plain “L”. I laughed, its amazing the barriers 
a few beers will undermine.
Next; Beach-Ball Party!
We passed the Strand and the movie was almost over. We sobbed, 
and the manager let us in to watch the last half of, “Beach-Ball Par­
ty.” The real world understands. Later, we were hungry; everybody 
at the “Original” was eating. So we ate. I had a buck when I got back 
to my old dorm.
Back at the old dorm!
It’d been a year since I’d seen the old hall. Its nice to make the trip 
back. When I lived here, I lived by a sea of flat green felt. I came back 
to the pool room to go swimming.
The Hustler!
A slick guy was there, so I played him. Lost my first four games at a 
quarter a piece. Broke; I turned to D.L. “Lemme a quarter? Thats all 
I need to win again.” He gave it to me and went to his room. Two hours 
later when my opponent left, all I had to show, was a quarter. I started 
towards my apartment.
The world unites!
Met a friend who wanted to talk. He came over to my place. Bendy my 
roommate was there and he tells me; “Went to a party tonight, left 
early.” Suddenly the three of us saw the T.V. set!
What now? The Raven!
“Bella Logusi and Boris Karloff, The Raven!... Old times, again!” 
We all laughed. We all smiled. We were at the same place. I flipped 
my last quarter up in the air. George caught it. “D.L. said you owe that 
to him.” Yes. Yeah. That’s my five buck night.
The Reviewnnthlne here but a quiet Saturday night, where nothing happened. Because at one time or anothor ufQ'tro ail h‘id u. night like
this. And if for a second you saw that something did happen; then may­
be next week you’ll enjoy it when I review, “The Chase.”

Of Security Police
gyp
IIrm
Chief Wayne is instituting many 
campus police.
Bruce Wayne, noted philan­
thropist, law enforcement offi­
cer, and man-about-town, has 
been named head of the campus 
security police.
Wayne’s first official action in 
office was to name young Richard 
Grayson as his assistant. Says 
Wayne, “There has not been 
enough communication between 
the security police and the stu­
dents, and I feel that Dick speaks 
the kids’ language.”
First on Wayne’s list for 
“cleaning up the campus” are 
stopping the rash of campus bur­
glaries (“Any unauthorized ap­
propriation of private property 
is heinous and low”); and the en­
forcement of L.C.B. laws at fra­
ternity parties (“Liquor corrupts 
the minds and bodies of our young 
people”X 
Chief Wayne also plans an in­
vestigation of the architecture 
department. “If there’s one thing 
I hate to see,” explained the 
chief, “it’s clean-cut American 
college kids being led astray by 
malicious foreign agitators.”
Tubs To Fill 
Function For 
Fine Arts
> The Carnegie Tech Col­
lage of Fine Arts announced 
today the purchase of super 
bathtubs, super suds, super 
wash clothes, and super 
towels for use by students.
Dean Spice, the school’s dean, 
and members of the Administra­
tive Council agreed that the corn­
et plaints made by Maggie Murph, 
E&S and graduate students, not to 
mention the faculty, had to be an­
swered. Pickets were beginning to 
overrun the Arts building with their 
posters, banners, and letters in­
sisting that the Fine Arts School 
be “cleaned up.”
Arts students passively over­
stepped pickets who began to camp 
on the building’s steps. But the of- 
^ fensive odors that arose from the 
building mixed with the abominable 
sulfur fumes of the nearby steel 
mills and chemical plants made 
breathing at Carnegie Tech almost 
impossible.
Dean Spice was forced to aban­
don his letter writing to Fine Arts 
students concerning the misuse of 
the building’s elevator and procee­
ded to concentrate his efforts on 
£ the fumigation of the school, itself.
It is now mandatory that Arts

Steam Rises As 
Fader Focuses
As The Hunt Library let off lots 
of steam last week, it was shrou­
ded in colored lights. Pink puffs 
of pretty steam rose above the 
thawing ivy and were transferred 
into billows of blue and flames 
of red.
Directing the play, L. Fader 
announced which buttons the dra­
matic switchboard operators 
should push. Technicians at­
tempted to place their strips of 
cellulose in front of the Drooer 
footlight.
Distracted from their midterm 
library studies more than 200 
students watched the experiment.
Tech Drops Regulations;
Gives Women Freedom
Opportunity knocked 
yesterday at the porticos of 
the Morewood Prison, when 
the Administration at Car­
negie Tech announced the 
abandonment of all regula­
tions for junior and senior 
wenches.
For those eligible tarts 
who choose to continue re 
siding in their respective 
cells, a certain degree o 
liberalization may be taken 
advantage of. In addition 
to the removal of curfews

Protest Causes Cut
In Tech Spending
As a result of the widespread student protest 
against the Administration’s recent decision to in­
crease Carnegie Tech’s tuition rates, Dr. Huntington 
Retriever, president of the institution, announced today 
that tuition will be decreased rather than increased, 
for the coming academic year.
Because Carnegie Tech re-
ceives so few private, state and fe­
deral grants and loans, a cutback 
in spending will be necessary. In­
structors’ salaries will decrease, 
less will be spent on scientific 
research, and the school’s unequa­
led facilities, in particular Mar­
garet Morrison and Skibo, will un­dergo radical neglect.
Dr. Retriever took this impor­
tant step, after researching the

Skibo Food Rats High With 
Detectives From Nausea
The National Association for the Uplifting of School 
Eating Areas announced this week that Skibo has won 
an award for ‘delicious’ food and ‘sanitary’ facilities. 
Apparently Skibo was given the highest rating ever 
recorded by examining representatives.
Among its highlights of com­
mendation NAUSEA pointed to a 
report by one of its agents. The 
agent fingered only five stacks of 
glasses before he found a clean 
one. The committee commended 
his findings.
It has also acknowledged Skibo’s 
meat selection. Not only is the 
meat of the ‘highest’ quality, but 
it comes in fresh from western 
ranches daily, overstepping the 
unnecessary inspection at the 
hands of the United States govern­
ment.
NAUSEA praised Skibo’s cost- 
minimizing techniques which ena­
ble the school to “serve food at
more nominal prices.” Two spe­
cific examples were cited in the 
report: the use of leftovers from 
the contract line in the pay line, 
and the 57 variety use for the solid 
dough bisquits that are served on 
the average of five times a week. 
These bisquits serve in every 
capacity, from four-day residents 
of the roll bin, to undercover 
agents in the Skibo rendition of 
straberry shortcake.
NAUSEA has awarded Skibo its 
White Rat Food Service Award 
with “A rat in every pot” en­
graved on the citation accompany­
ing the award.
Tech Propose 
More Diggins
A Real Dig
Recent landscaping around the 
new Administration Building 
(tentatively scheduled for com­
pletion in the fall of 1973) has 
been so successful that school 
officials are planning to extend 
it and possibly even include it in 
the Tech-Pitt cooperation pro­
gram. “We dig it the most,” 
they say.
Hie physical education depart­
ment is also in favor of the plant, 
claiming that the detour walk pro­
vides an “extra physical chal­
lenge for the physically superior 
Carnegie Tech students.” The 
painting, design and sculpture 
department, on the other hand, is 
interested in the walk’s struc­
ture and {dans to build several 
more. Included in their plans 
is a figure-eight between the 
Fine Arts Building and Baker 
Hall.
The possibility of using this 
unnatural resource in a propos­
ed merger with Pitt arose when a 
Pitt official suggested that they 
would lend them some of our top- 
soil to fill Panther Hollow.
This article is part of the 
Tartan’s determined effort to 
give its readers the real dirt.

6 a.m., the L.C.B. (Liquor 
Control Board) will license 
junior and senior floors so 
that bars may be instituted 
in these areas; and fully 
equipped kitchens will be 
established on each floor.

sex at all hours, steam heat must 
be turned off by 3 a.m. Lights may 
be kept on. Each apartment will 
be provided with a tap system.
The association of Warped Suf- 
fagettes also proposed heterosex­
ual housing for the coming year, 
however the Administration felt 
this would unnecessarily con­
tribute to the population explo­
sion. While the women student 
could cope with the apartment si­
tuation and would exercise her 
self-control, Swedish-style living 
has not as yet been accepted by 
American society, and the coed 
living facilities would place the 
institution’s reputation in jeopar­
dy with the community.

The plan for women’s housing 
was initially conceived by Dean’s 
Pelician and Stork, Dean of Men 
and Women students respectively.
The deans agreed that, “eman­
cipation promiscuity, and homo­
logy will be the future creed of 
Carnegie Tech’s social situation. 
Excess, however, in any way, 
shape, or form will not be tole­
rated. We feel that our girls will 
assume the responsibilities of 
adults in their new freedom, and 
our boys will display the respect 
and admiration that the women stu­
dents anticipate. We do not wish to 
be hypocritical when we say that we 
believe experimentation with sex, 
alcohol, smoking, and the like is 
a most important part of college 
life.”
"Messiah ” Sing
An opportunity to sing Handel’s 
“Messiah” will be open to the en­
tire Carnegie Tech community, 
without rehearsal or audience, on 
Tuesday, April 5, from U:30 to 
12:30 p.m. in the Fine Arts Ex­
hibition Hall.
Professor Roland Leich will 
conduct, and Professor Hugh 
Young will accompany. Scores 
will be loaned by the Mendel­
ssohn Choir.
