“Win or lose, you represent 
the best that staff has to offer, 
and your contributions are an 
example for staff members 
who serve day in and day out 
to improve our campus com-
munity,” said John Lanyon, 
chair of staff council, at the 
19th annual Andy Awards. 
The ceremony, which was 
held in McConomy Audito-
rium, honors Carnegie Mellon 
faculty and staff for their con-
tributions to the university.
President Subra Suresh be-
gan the ceremony by talking 
about the importance of out-
standing faculty and staff to 
the university experience. 
“[Students] get recogni-
tion — they get a degree, they 
get awards. But, with respect 
to staff, there isn’t recognition 
for the powerful work they do 
behind the scenes, as perhaps 
there should be. And this is 
why we acknowledge, and 
recognize, and celebrate peo-
ple who do so much behind 
the scenes,” Suresh said.
The awards, held last 
Thursday, were given in a va-
riety of categories. The ?rst 
awards were given by Lanyon 
for staff service; 28 faculty 
and staff members were hon-
ored for 30 years of service, 
and 10 were recognized for 
35 years. Two faculty and staff 
members — Marian Koval-
chik, assistant department 
head for ?nance for electrical 
and computer engineering, 
and Alan Guisewite, opera-
tions assistant at the Robotics 
Institute — were recognized 
for 40 years of service to Carn-
egie Mellon.
University provost and H. 
John Heinz III professor of 
economics and public policy 
Mark Kamlet spoke next. Ka-
mlet credited Carnegie Mel-
lon’s progress as an institution 
over the last few decades to its 
dedicated staff and faculty.

Paint vandalism in Doherty leads to stricter Fence rules
NOËL UM
News Co-Editor
Multicolored dribbles of 
paint up the steps and down 
the hallway of Doherty Hall 
have caused the reinforce-
ment of rules regarding the 
Fence.
Last Thursday, the student 
government Executive Com-
mittee sent out an email to the 
campus community outlining 
existing rules about the use of 
paint in the areas surround-
ing the Fence.
The rules for the Fence, 
according to university guide-
lines, include using only 
paintbrushes, keeping paint 
and paint materials only 
within the gravel area sur-
rounding the Fence, removing 
paint supplies after ?nishing 
painting, utilizing the sink in 
the janitor’s closet in Doherty 
Hall instead of the ?rst ?oor 
bathroom sinks to clean 
paintbrushes, and not drip-
ping paint on the steps out-
side or inside Doherty Hall.
The paint smudges, which 
have been a recurring issue 
since last spring, are techni-
cally considered campus van-
dalism. Additionally, such 
vandalism, especially paint 
on the steps and inside of 
Doherty Hall, may be a costly 
?x. 
Sophomore mechanical 
engineering major Anna Mi-
rabella, who took the Fence 
with the Kappa Alpha Theta 
pledge class, said that she 
witnessed paint dribbles in 
Doherty, speci?cally in the 
?rst ?oor bathroom. “It was 
de?nitely a problem before, 
but I think that this is a very 
simple change that people can 
make that will help keep our 
school cleaner. Paint isn’t al-
ways to easy to clean up, so it 
also wasn’t fair to make other 
people clean up after the stu-
dents’ mess.”
Student government has 
rarely found reason in the 
past to enforce the rules for 
the Fence, according to stu-
dent body president Lindsay 
MacGillivray.
“In the past we had not 
set any speci?c guidelines be-
cause we felt it was something 
that as a campus, we shared 
and held together, but at the 
same time, if students are 
damaging campus property, 
something needs to be done,” 
she said.
The rules regarding the 
Fence were purposely written 
vaguely because of the sense 
that the Fence is not owned 
by the university, but by the 
student body as a whole.
“The responsibility and 
the privileges of the Fence are 
shared by all students on cam-
pus and so when people felt 
like they needed to complain 
about it was student govern-
ment, but really we don’t have 
any set jurisdiction over it,” 
MacGillivray said.
“We wanted to have a more 
clear de?nition of what the 
rules meant. We took what 
already existed, and put it in 
more speci?c terms,” MacGil-
livray continued.
Complaints from various 
faculty members brought stu-
dent government’s attention 
to the vandalism, and student 
government is in the process 
of implementing action.
In order to enforce bet-
ter care of campus property 
and the Fence, student gov-
ernment has issued signs, 
which are currently posted 
in Doherty and on the tables 
near the Fence, reminding 
students to be careful about 
dripping paint.
The student government 
Executive Committee is also 
putting out plastic bags by the 
Fence to alleviate the prob-
lem of dripping paint inside 
Doherty as students are car-
rying their paintbrushes to 
the sink for washing. The last 
component of the enforce-
ment of these rules includes 
a ?ne, which will be charged 
against the organizations that 
are found to have dripped 
paint and vandalized campus 
property.
According to MacGillivray, 
student government will be 
?exible in charging organiza-
tions for the ?nes, however, 
she hopes that the action tak-
en to prevent such vandalism 
will eliminate the issue.
Sophomore information 
systems major Nathan Oh 
said that even though he is 
involved with Asian Students 
Association and Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon — and has painted 
the Fence multiple times — 
he was unaware of the Fence 
painting rules. “I didn’t know 
that dripping paint outside 
of the Fence area was con-
sidered vandalism, so I think 
it was a good ?rst step that 
student government sent out 
that email, because now I and 
others know, and will be more 
careful.”

Online for-credit courses available to CMU students
CHRIS GALVIN
Staffwriter
Semester Online, which 
debuted at Carnegie Mellon 
this semester, offers students 
an opportunity to gain credit 
from online courses at other 
universities.
Semester Online describes 
itself as a “?rst-of-its-kind 
program offering rigorous, 
for-credit online courses from 
prestigious colleges and uni-
versities to top undergradu-
ate students worldwide.” The 
program began with over 100 
students in 10 courses across 
the consortium, and has ex-
panded to 19 courses for the 
coming spring semester.
Semester Online courses 
are provided to Carnegie 
Mellon students by consor-
tium partner schools, such 
as Boston College, Brandeis 
University, Emory University, 
Northwestern University, the 
University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill, the University 
of Notre Dame, Wake Forest 
University, and Washington 
University in St. Louis, all of 
which were ranked in the top 
35 of U.S. News & World Re-
port’s annual Best Colleges list 
for 2014.
Courses consist of weekly 
live classes via webcam and 
online chats, capped at 20 stu-
dents, with traditional class 
structure — including dis-
cussions, slides, and quizzes. 
These courses are designed 
to be equivalent to on-campus 
classes and are taught by the 
same professors.
“Despite calling in from 
all different places across the 
country, it has been really 
easy to interact and connect 
with the professors and other 
students,” said Northwestern 
journalism major Netta-Lee 
Lax, according to Semester 
Online. “The class I’m in only 
has three other students, 
which has made the learning 
process more ful?lling for me 
personally.”
All courses from Semester 
Online are worth three cred-
its, which are accepted by 
Carnegie Mellon. The univer-
sity offering the course will 
issue the credit, provided that 
the student has completed the 
course with a passing grade, 
and the student will receive 
an of?cial transcript from that 
university.
“The expansion of Semes-
ter Online’s course offerings 
demonstrates the speed at 
which the program is grow-
ing, as we provide more 
students the opportunity to 
participate in this unique 
academic experience,” said 
Andrew Hermalyn, executive 
vice president and general 
manager of Semester Online.
Courses for the spring 
2014 semester include How to 
Rule the World from Boston 
College, Baseball and Ameri-
can Culture from Emory Uni-
versity, Electronics Out of 
the Box from Northwestern 
University, and Critical Earth 
Issues from Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis.
Semester Online gives stu-
dents the opportunity to take 
courses that they otherwise 
would not be able to, if the 
desired course is not taught 
at their university, or if they 
can’t be on campus due to a 
full-time job or internship.
“Students will no longer 
grapple with the dilemma 
of sacri?cing an internship 
or volunteer opportunity to 
take a required course,” wrote 
Northwestern senior Wil-
liam McLaughlin in The Daily 
Northwestern.
Many students ?nd the 
weekly classes easier to ?t 
into a busy schedule, and 
since students can attend 
class anywhere with Internet 
access, they can take courses 
while studying abroad or at 
home over the summer.
According to USA Today, 
Emory University senior and 
Semester Online student 
Nenad Tadic said, “In our 
increasingly ‘busy’ lives, we 
want to pursue as many op-
portunities as we can without 
having their qualities deval-
ued and online courses allow 
us to do that.”
“The fact is, everyone is 
very bright and really wants 
to be there. And the ?exibil-
ity is awesome. It’s de?nitely 
something I’d recommend to 
other students,” Tadic said.

App allows students to request services
ALVIN MATTHEW
Staffwriter
Three Carnegie Mellon 
graduates recently created 
MeWants, an app that allows 
students to post requests 
for services they would like 
completed. Carnegie Mellon 
students, many without cars, 
often run into trouble when 
needing to obtain certain ma-
terials, furniture, groceries or 
supplies.
Former Carnegie Mellon 
graduate students Mohit Bi-
jlani (HNZ ’07) and Mikhil 
Innani (HNZ ’11), along with 
SUNY Buffalo alumna Chait-
anya Mehta (HNZ ’11), creat-
ed MeWants in order to alle-
viate some of these burdens. 
The idea for the startup was 
conceived while the three 
were at Carnegie Mellon and 
it won the Keith Block Entre-
preneurship Challenge of-
fered by the university.
“MeWants is an outsourc-
ing site that allows people to 
outsource their tasks to the 
community. Someone logs in, 
posts a task, and can make it 
visible for something like a 
5–10 mile radius for the spe-
ci?c period. It’s like a Craig-
slist, but students have an 
inherent trust with others in 
the student community,” Bi-
jlani said.
According its website, 
“MeWants lets you post tasks 
you’d like completed, as well 
as the price you’re willing to 
pay for the service, to a will-
ing audience in your area.”
A person who wants to get 
their groceries picked up, re-
ceive help with moving or get-
ting to an airport would log 
into the app and pay another 
user to help them. While cur-
rently focusing on Carnegie 
Mellon’s student body, Me-
Wants hopes to expand to the 
University of Pittsburgh and 
beyond in the future.
Bijlani feels the app is ap-
pealing for students because 
it does not charge extra for 
its services. “The app itself 
is free, but we offer cash and 
Paypal options for payment,” 
he said.

Sunday, with proceeds going 
to Gateway Rehabilitation 
Center. 
Gateway Rehab — a non-
pro?t organization — looks 
to promote the education, 
treatment, prevention, and 
research of alcoholism and 
substance abuse.
Tembo died of alcohol 
poisoning in 2010. He was 
an avid soccer player and a 
social member of Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus.
Carnegie Mellon, the 
University of Pittsburgh, 
Duquesne University, and 
nearby clubs sent over 20 
teams to the tournament this 
year, which, according to a 
university press release on 
the topic, included sponsors 
such as Chipotle Mexican 
Grill, Quiznos, Bruegger’s, 
the Pittsburgh Riverhounds, 
Startup Incinerator, and 
Gateway Rehab.

History department debuts lecture series
Carnegie Mellon’s depart-
ment of history recently an-
nounced that it is launching 
a year-long lecture series to 
celebrate the department’s 
long-time focus on environ-
mental history. The history 
department has excelled for 
several decades in under-
standing the impacts that 
the human world has on 
urban environments, espe-
cially through the work of 
Joel Tarr, a Richard S. Calig-
uiri professor of history and 
policy.
In 2008, Tarr was award-
ed the Society for the History 
of Technology’s Leonardo da 
Vinci Medal. This medal goes 
to someone who has made 
an outstanding contribution 
to the history of technology 
through research, teaching, 
publication, and other ac-
tivities.
“People often do not think 
about how the environment 
links to city environments, 
and we have been fortunate 
to have extremely talented 
faculty working in this dy-
namic area,” said Caroline 
Acker, head of the history 
department, in a university 
press release.
“Because of recent ?ood-
ing incidents and ongoing is-
sues like climate change and 
global warming, the ?eld is 
on the rise. More graduate 
students are coming to Carn-
egie Mellon to study envi-
ronmental history, which is 
very encouraging because it 
is critical to look at the past.”
Kate Brown, associate 
professor of history at the 
University of Maryland, will 
open the lecture series with 
a talk about the presence 
of radioactive isotopes in 
the bodies of nuclear plant 
workers. Brown will discuss 
and explain the effects of 
transforming the human 
body into a “radioactive stor-
age site.” 
Brown will argue that a 
?xation on sequestered ar-
chives and environmental 
monitoring has hindered a 
real understanding of the 
effect of turning human bod-
ies into radioactive storage 
sites. Brown’s lecture is titled 
“A Sinking Feeling: The Hu-
man Body as the Ultimate 
Radioactive Storage Site,” 
and will debut Thursday, 
Oct. 17 at 4:30 p.m.

“We had students who 
have had similar issues, and 
we would willingly help peo-
ple move out for a quick buck. 
The idea started there.... We 
didn’t really think about the 
monetary value, and we don’t 
want the app to have annoy-
ing ads. So we’re mostly using 
Paypal [to earn money],” he 
continued.
For those hoping to cre-
ate a startup, Bijlani offered 
some advice. He particularly 
stressed the importance of 
networking. “I always want-
ed to create a startup, and I 
worked on my ?rst startup 
with a friend from India.”
Innani originally ap-
proached Bijlani for advice, 
but after demonstrating pas-
sion for the project, “things 
took off from there. You 
should have an idea that you 
want to put 10 years of your 
life into, and having ?nancial 
stability helps. You can also 
work for a startup,” Bijlani 
said.
Bijlani feels the entrepre-
neurial atmosphere at Carn-
egie Mellon, while imperfect, 
is constantly improving. “The 
focus is very much on get-
ting jobs, but I know there 
has been a concerted effort 
by the university to build a 
connection between Tepper 
and the [computer science] 
community. There needs to 
be that push from the univer-
sity to have students under-
stand it’s okay to fail and have 
times when these things don’t 
work.”
Some students are inter-
ested in the emergence of 
these campus-focused startup 
companies. 
Sarabeth Perry, sopho-
more global studies major, 
thinks that the idea behind 
MeWants is appealing. “It’s 
probably a better thing than 
CraigsList because you know 
the people [in the communi-
ty]. It sounds like it could be 
messy, but it could also work,” 
she said.
In the past, students have 
often turned to Facebook for 
secondhand goods. Facebook 
pages for students of different 
years in the university have 
been used to advertise and 
sell goods ranging from tick-
ets, phones, Megabus credits, 
and textbooks. This past year, 
another page, “For Sale @ 
CMU” was created to more di-
rectly offer students a chance 
to buy goods for lower prices 
from peers who are looking to 
unload their unwanted items. 
As of Sunday, Oct. 13 there 
were 823 members listed in 
the group, with things like 
food containers, longboards, 
books and hair dryers be-
ing bought and sold. Me-
Wants hopes to cater to this 
audience.

have evolved from a highly re-
gional institution to one with 
such a national and interna-
tional stature,” Kamlet said.
Next, Kamlet announced 
the recipient of the Andy 
Award for Outstanding Dedi-
cation. According to the Andy 
Awards website, this award 
is meant for a faculty or staff 
member who “takes great 
pride in their work” and has 
an “unyielding commitment 
to quality performance.”
The Outstanding Dedica-
tion award was given to Anne 
Witchner Levin (DC ’73), as-
sistant dean of student affairs 
and and director of orienta-
tion and ?rst-year programs.
“I was honored to be nomi-
nated and very moved to win 
the Andy Award, especially 
because the category had 
something close to 20 nomi-
nations,” Witchner said via 
email. 
“At CMU, I have had innu-
merable unique opportunities 
to work with students on some 
of the best programs and ex-
periences.... I also had the op-
portunity to help create new 
programs with exceptional 
students and colleagues.”
The next Andy Award was 
for Outstanding Commitment 
to Students. 
This award honors a 
staff or faculty member who 
is,“dedicated to providing 
guidance and assistance to 
the students of the univer-
sity.”
This award was given to 
Helen Wang (DC ’99), direc-
tor of student life for ?rst-year 
houses and Morewood E-tow-
er housefellow. 
“I’m deeply humbled, 
quite in shock and feeling so 
fortunate to be a part of this 
generous community.   I am 
so touched by the time and 
generosity of spirit that was 
put into this nomination by 
people that I care so deeply 
about,” Wang said in an email. 
 The Andy Award for Out-
standing Innovation was 
given to the Tepper School 
of Business (TSB) Marketing 
and Communications Team, 
which includes Stephanie 
Armbruster (A ’06), Karen 
Boucher, Mark Burd, Barbara 
Donehue, Deb Lantz (HSS 
’06), Susan Limoncelli, Joey 
Mancuso, and Martha Sproul.
The Marketing and Com-
munications Team, according 
to its website, helps those in 
the Tepper School of Business 
and others across the univer-
sity with brand projection and 
public relations. 
The Outstanding Innova-
tion Andy Award “recognizes 
those who have developed 
new approaches, methods 
and systems to improve orga-
nizational effectiveness,” ac-
cording to the Andy Awards 
website.
The next Andy Award was 
for Outstanding Culture. This 
award was given to Samuel 
Boyer, senior director of orga-
nizational management with-
in the College of Engineering. 
James H. Garrett, Jr., 
Thomas Lord professor of 
engineering and dean of the 
College of Engineering, nomi-
nated Boyer because he is, 
“passionate about providing 
staff with opportunities to 
grow their skills in an effort 
to retain and recruit high-per-
forming staff members.”
The Andy Award for Out-
standing University Citizen-
ship was awarded to Ro-
mayne Botti, associate dean 
of ?nance and operations for 
the College of Engineering.

CMU physicists on the frontier of quantum computing
SONIA KATHARANI-KHAN
Staffwriter
Robert Grif?ths is pas-
sionate about his position as 
a physicist. He’s willing to ex-
plain his complicated research 
on quantum cryptography, 
which seems to always be on 
his mind, to anyone willing to 
listen. As he sat in his cluttered 
of?ce, he even joked about 
what would happen if Edward 
Snowden were to be within 
a quantum cryptographic 
scheme.
Grif?ths, the Otto Stern 
University Professor of Phys-
ics, established the Quantum 
Theory Group at Carnegie 
Mellon in 1984. Grif?ths still 
heads the group with two 
members: Vikesh Siddhu and 
Dan Stahlke, both Ph.D. can-
didates in physics. The group’s 
research focuses on the foun-
dations of quantum theory, as 
well as its potential applica-
tions, including quantum com-
puting and information.
Quantum computing vs. 
classical computing
As the name suggests, 
quantum computing is the de-
velopment of computer tech-
nology based on the principles 
of quantum physics. Although 
primarily theoretical at pres-
ent, quantum computing is a 
compelling ?eld because its 
utilization of “quantum bits” 
(qubits) rather than classical 
bits allows for the develop-
ment of quantum computers, 
which in certain areas far sur-
pass the limitations of today’s 
computers.
The bits that today’s com-
puters use to transmit and 
store information can only 
hold one of two values — often 
explained with the numerals 0 
and 1 — and exist in one dis-
tinct physical state. Qubits, on 
the other hand, are represent-
ed by the spins of elementary 
particles, which can exist in 
multiple states simultaneously 
until measured. This prop-
erty, known as superposition, 
allows a quantum computer 
with “n” qubits to perform “2n” 
calculations at the same time, 
while a classical computer 
with the same amount of bits 
can perform only “n”. A sec-
ond property of qubits, known 
as entanglement, allows them 
to be very strongly correlated 
at extremely large distances.
More speci?cally, qubits 
take on distinct “spins.” Two 
entangled qubits have oppo-
site spins to one another and 
can remain in unison even if 
they are at opposite ends of 
the universe. Entanglement 
allows for faster transporta-
tion of information using qu-
bits rather than classical bits.
If a quantum computer 
were developed based on 
these properties, however, 
it would not bring much im-
provement to ordinary com-
puter tasks involving simple 
calculations. So, where exact-
ly does the magic of quantum 
computers lie? It begins where 
the scope of today’s comput-
ers ends. The potential of 
quantum computing was real-
ized with the development of 
Shor’s algorithm for the prime 
factorization of long numbers.
Though today’s computer 
cannot perform such factor-
ization, quantum computers 
could implement Shor’s al-
gorithm and solve problems 
which would otherwise take 
today’s most powerful super-
computers hundreds of mil-
lions of years to solve. The 
Quantum Theory Group con-
tributed a major simpli?cation 
in the ?nal step of the algo-
rithm in a proposal by Grif?ths 
and Ph.D. student Chi-Sheng 
Niu in 1996.
Current limitations in 
quantum computing
Thus far, researchers have 
some understanding of how 
quantum particles behave, 
and how they could lead to 
more ef?cient technology. 
This has not yet translated, 
however, to a full understand-
ing of how quantum particles 
may come together to create a 
system of information.
“Classical information in 
general we know everything 
about. The question is, what 
is the corresponding quan-
tum counterpart? You would 
think it would be something 
measured in qubits, but no-
body really knows,” Grif?ths 
explained.
The group’s research ex-
pands on the understanding 
of what ‘quantum informa-
tion’ really is and how it would 
function, and investigates the 
scope of the computational 
methods that can be devel-
oped by harnessing the prop-
erties of quantum particles.
Grif?ths’s take on the dif-
ference between quantum and 
classical information is analo-
gous to “the world of classical 
information being a world of 
black and white, and that of 
quantum information being a 
world of colors.”
The group has been work-
ing toward understanding the 
?ow of information through 
quantum circuits, and study-
ing some of the limits to copy-
ing quantum information.
A second obstacle to devel-
oping physical quantum com-
puters is that there are not yet 
methods to harness the differ-
ent manipulations of quantum 
particles — such as superposi-
tion and entanglement — long 
enough to create viable tech-
nology utilizing them.
“At the moment we don’t 
have an appropriate physical 
system that can perform quan-
tum computing on the large 
scale. There are lot of physical 
systems that provide a testbed 
for these quantum computing 
ideas, but we have not found 
a way to manage large bits of 
information on them,” Siddhu 
said.
The dif?culty stems from 
a property known as decoher-
ence. If one tries to directly 
measure the value of a qubit, 
it will cease to exist in super-
position, and assume one 
value just like a classical bit. 
This would render a system of 
qubits no better than a classi-
cal one. A potential solution 
is to use the strong correla-
tion between entangled qubits 
to gather information about 
pairs of qubits, but entangle-
ment is also dif?cult to main-
tain as the number of qubits 
increases.
The group has been re-
searching how entanglement 
can lead to nearly instant 
transmission of information 
in order to better understand 
decoherence in information-
theoretic terms and strength-
en the potential applications 
of quantum computing.
Quantum computing and 
cryptography
So, amongst all the po-
tential applications that arise 
from the properties of quan-
tum particles, has there been 
any headway in making quan-
tum computing practical? 
According to Grif?ths, quan-
tum cryptography — or data 
security schemes based on 
quantum computing — is the 
aspect of quantum computing 
closest to commercialization 
or practical use.
“All the cryptographic sys-
tems that are employed to 
send simple things like e-mails 
or to authorize complex things 
like transfer of money through 
banks depend on the fact that 
classical computers cannot 
factorize primes ef?ciently,” 
Siddhu said. “A quantum com-
puter would essentially be 
able to break these codes … So 
what to do if quantum comput-
ers can break the major clas-
sical cryptographic scheme? 
The idea is to come up with 
systems that are quantum se-
cure, which is where quantum 
cryptography comes in.”
Rather than depending on 
the dif?culty of factorizing 
primes, quantum cryptogra-
phy depends on the unusual 
behavior of quantum parti-
cles. The sender sends a ran-
domly generated sequence of 
qubits to the receiver across 
a quantum channel. After 
going through the process 
of recording the sent and re-
ceived results, the two com-
pare notes via conventional 
methods to ensure that the 
receiver received the correct 
information. An eavesdropper 
trying to intercept the quan-
tum channel and extract in-
formation would be detected 
because their attempt would 
cause an unusual amount of 
discrepancy between the orig-
inal and received messages, 
which would serve as a warn-
ing signal to the sender and 
receiver.
In this regard, quantum 
cryptography is more secure. 
Today’s cryptographic meth-
ods could be intercepted by 
an eavesdropper with neither 
sender nor receiver noticing.
The group has been work-
ing to further the security 
of quantum cryptographic 
schemes, and has made head-
way into ef?ciently detect-
ing eavesdropping within a 
scheme. But amidst all the 
emerging developments, 
There is a question that arose:  
What is the true driving force 
behind developing this new 
system of computation?
“As with most theoreti-
cal physics, the driving force 
is a quest for understanding” 
Stahlke explained. “We have 
a fundamentally new type of 
information: quantum infor-
mation. In the coming decades 
we may be able to exploit this 
new tool to build a quantum 
computer, but for now we 
study this to learn about the 
nature of quantum mechan-
ics and about the nature of 
information. And since the 
universe we live in is quantum 
mechanical, it makes sense 
that we should try and gain an 
understanding of the quantum 
version of information.”

ExpressionBlast, a new 
search engine developed by 
scientists at Carnegie Mellon 
University and Bar-Ilan Uni-
versity, helps scientists com-
pare gene expression data 
with millions of other studies 
in order to ?nd experiments 
with similar pro?les.
Ziv Bar-Joseph, associate 
professor in Carnegie Mel-
lon’s computational biology 
department, led the research 
team that published its work 
in the October issue of Nature 
Methods; Guy Zinman, Shosha-
na Naiman, Yariv Kan?, and 
Haim Cohen co-authored 
the journal report. Multiple 
Carnegie Mellon employees 
and students also contributed 
toward developing the search 
engine.
Bar-Joseph’s research fo-
cused on creating a concise, 
systematic way to compare 
gene expression data.
“Everyone knows about 
DNA, the genetic material. We 
have exactly the same DNA in 
every cell of our body; howev-
er, all our cells are completely 
different in terms of what they 
do and look like [e.g., muscle 
cells vs. blood cells].... The 
reason that these cells are dif-
ferent is that different genes 
are being expressed,” said Zin-
man, now a research scientist 
in Carnegie Mellon’s Lane Cen-
ter for Computational Biology.
Zinman explained that 
the idea for ExpressionBlast 
originated from a paper that 
explored longevity in mice. In 
this research, expression of 
a certain gene allowed male 
mice to live 15 percent lon-
ger than control male mice; 
this phenomenon only oc-
curred in male mice. In order 
to make sense of the data, the 
researchers began to look for 
other experiments with simi-
lar results.
Currently, one of the main 
places to look for this informa-
tion is Gene Expression Omni-
bus (GEO), the largest public 
database for expression data. 
GEO contains more than a mil-
lion experiments, but does not 
provide an easy way for users 
to compare these experiments 
with their own results.
“As a research community, 
we had all this data, and it 
wasn’t being used as much as 
we would have liked. There 
was no way for you to compare 
your own results to the one 
million experiments that were 
out there,” Zinman said. “This 
is because every experiment 
uses a different machine, a 
different platform, a different 
animal, and is testing different 
conditions.”
ExpressionBlast automati-
cally organizes data from ge-
netic expression experiments 
on a weekly basis, so that they 
can be easily compared. “Ev-
eryone can now take their own 
experiment, put it on the web 
interface we developed, and 
?nd other experiments that 
have similar pro?les,” Zinman 
said.
ExpressionBlast has many 
applications in and out of the 
realm of science. Drug com-
panies, for example, could use 
ExpressionBlast to determine 
whether a potential chemical 
compound is affecting gene 
expression in a way shown to 
have the desired outcome in a 
previous experiment conduct-
ed by others, saving them time 
and money.
Zinman said that his work 
with ExpressionBlast was 
funded and greatly in?uenced 
by a program known as Inno-
vation Corps (I-Corps), a pro-
gram run by the National Sci-
ence Foundation that focuses 
on giving entrepreneurial 
training to students and pro-
fessors in order to foster com-
mercialization of ideas that 
arise throughout research.
“It is a manner of thinking 
that is completely different 
from academia,” he explained. 
“I used this business thinking 
later on with my research, 
when looking for collabora-
tors and research partners, 
and targeting my work to-
wards more practical appli-
cations that the biological or 
medical communities are cur-
rently lacking.”
“The idea is to translate 
research to the marketplace,” 
Zinman continued. “There’s 
so much research being done 
at universities that can be ap-
plied to real world problems 
in a very short time, and many 
times the researchers don’t 
have the skill set to go outside 
of the comfort zone of their 
labs and look for customers 
and commercialization op-
tions.”
Aside from the possible 
long-term potential of Expres-
sionBlast, Zinman said that 
positive feedback for the tool is 
already surfacing. “I get about 
one to two emails per day. I’ve 
seen tweets from Cuba, I’ve 
gotten questions from people 
in India, and even thank you 
emails from researchers,” Zin-
man said. “If it wasn’t for the 
publication, it was for these 
emails. Just for them, it was 
worth it.”
Despite the success of Ex-
pressionBlast, Zinman admits 
that there is still work to be 
done. “We still have many 
ideas that we would like to see 
implemented,” he said.
ExpressionBlast has made 
previously available gene ex-
pression data more useful, and 
has already begun to in?uence 
research worldwide. In the 
future, ExpressionBlast will 
undoubtedly affect the way in 
which gene expression data 
is analyzed and contribute to 
many aspects of the academic 
and commercial world.

Researchers improve transportation safety
ROHAN VARMA
Junior Staffwriter
Car-related accidents are 
one of the leading causes of 
death in the United States. 
Over 30,000 people died from 
car-related accidents in 2011, 
and thousands more are in-
volved in accidents that cause 
injury, according to the Na-
tional Highway Traf?c Safety 
Administration. 
Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon University, in con-
junction with the University 
of Pennsylvania and the De-
partment of Transportation 
(DOT), are taking strides to 
reduce these staggering num-
bers. Last week, DOT renewed 
the grant for Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Technologies for Safe 
and Ef?cient Transportation 
(T-SET) program for the next 
two years, awarding close to 
$5.7 million.
The DOT’s University Trans-
portation Centers program 
picks ?ve universities around 
the nation to lead and set the 
standards in strategic areas 
including safety, economic, en-
vironmental, and maintenance 
concerns with transportation.
Two years ago, T-SET part-
nered with the University of 
Pennsylvania and was recog-
nized as a University Trans-
portation Center with an em-
phasis on safety; it has been 
awarded $2.85 million in 
grant money each year since.
Ragunathan Rajkumar, the 
director of T-SET, said, “With 
Carnegie Mellon on the west 
and the University of Pennsyl-
vania on the east, we think we 
can improve safety in the state 
very well. However, this being 
a national center, we solve na-
tional issues. We think we can 
have a big impact on the re-
gional aspect, but we have an 
emphasis on the national scale 
of our projects.”
Rajkumar said that over 
the last three years, Carnegie 
Mellon has implemented nu-
merous technologies in the lo-
cal Pittsburgh area in order to 
increase ef?ciency and safety 
in the region.
The website parkpgh.org  
is one such example. On the 
website, users can see the ca-
pacity of all of the parking ga-
rages in Pittsburgh in order to 
cut out the arduous process of 
roaming around the city look-
ing for parking. A similar pro-
gram called Tiramisu informs 
transit-users about the capac-
ity of buses around the city so 
that they are not left waiting 
for a bus that ends up being 
full.
In addition, advanced traf-
?c lights are being installed in 
East Liberty; the lights moni-
tor traf?c coming from all di-
rections and make decisions 
about what the lights’ colors 
should be every two seconds. 
With this technology, driv-
ers are no longer stopped by 
red lights at empty intersec-
tions and are more likely to 
hit consecutive green lights 
instead of constantly stopping 
and going.
With this new round of 
funding, T-SET is looking to 
invest in new types of accident 
prevention methods.
For instance, T-SET is ex-
panding research that will 
allow sensors to gauge the 
conditions on the road and de-
termine if an accident is likely 
to occur. While this technolo-
gy was previously directed to-
wards vehicle infrastructure, 
new initiatives are being made 
to implement it for bicycles 
and pedestrians.
“We are looking to add 
technologies into bicycles and 
pedestrians because many of 
the accidents occur between a 
car and a pedestrian or biker,” 
Rajkumar said. “The technol-
ogy would go into the smart-
phones of the pedestrians and 
onto little devices to be placed 
on the bicycles.” Additional 
initiatives in these forms of 
intelligent transportation sys-
tems include vehicle-to-infra-
structure communication.
Rajkumar said that T-SET 
is working on technologies 
that would allow traf?c lights 
to directly inform cars of the 
status of the light and respond 
to different situations. For in-
stance, if the driver is not pay-
ing attention and is approach-
ing a red light, the technology 
will slow the car down to a 
stop and prevent a potential 
accident from occurring.
Additionally, vehicle-to-vehi-
cle communications offer great 
leaps in safety. One branch of 
research is developing com-
munication and sensing de-
vices that can detect the rela-
tive distance between cars. If 
cars are positioned too closely 
or are on a projectile pathway 
to collide, the device will actu-
ate a response, such as a stop 
or redirection, in order to pre-
vent the accident.
Each year, thousands of 
accidents occur when drivers 
run red lights or bump into 
each other. 
“More than 90 percent 
of automotive accidents are 
caused by human error,” Raj-
kumar said.
On roads ?tted with intel-
ligent transportation systems, 
human error could be largely 
mitigated. Rajkumar envisions 
that, within the next 10 years, 
the technologies developed 
at Carnegie Mellon will ?nd 
their way into many roads, 
traf?c lights, and cellphones 
around the country.

The Swedish Nobel com-
mittee announced the win-
ners of the Nobel Prize last 
week. The winners of each 
category share an approxi-
mately $1.2 million prize.
Nobel Prize in 
Physiology or Medicine
The 2013 Nobel Prize 
in Physiology or Medicine 
was awarded to James E. 
Rothman of Yale Univer-
sity; Randy W. Schekman of 
the University of California, 
Berkeley; and Thomas C. 
Südhof of Stanford Universi-
ty. According to the commit-
tee, the award was granted 
based on their “discoveries of 
machinery regulating vesicle 
traf?c, a major transport sys-
tem in our cells.”
Vesicles are necessary 
for the transportation of 
molecules within our cells; 
think of a vesicle as a bus or 
cart, carrying precious pas-
sengers like insulin through 
the cell. How vesicles were 
able to pick up and drop off 
this cargo at the correct time, 
however, largely remained 
a mystery. Schekman’s re-
search focused mainly on the 
genes necessary for vesicle 
transport. Rothman provided 
insight into the necessary 
proteins needed for vesicle 
docking and fusion, and Süd-
hof looked at the chemical 
signals that told the vesicles 
when to release their cargo. 
Nobel Prize in Physics
The 2013 Nobel Prize in 
Physics was shared by Fran-
çois Englert of the Université 
Libre de Bruxelles — located 
in Brussels, Belgium — and 
Peter Higgs of the University 
of Edinburgh, U.K. They re-
ceived the award due to their 
theoretical proposal of “a 
mechanism that contributes 
to our understanding of the 
origin of mass of subatomic 
particles,” which was proven 
in 2012. This is often referred 
to as the Higgs boson.
In the ’60s, Englert and 
Higgs both independently 
proposed a theory of how 
particles gain mass. This 
theory was an integral part of 
the standard model of parti-
cle physics, which states that 
everything in the universe is 
made up of matter particles. 
The Higgs boson is the par-
ticle associated with an in-
visible ?eld that takes up all 
space. This invisible ?eld is 
necessary for existence, as 
particles acquire mass only 
by interacting with this ?eld. 
In 2012, scientists were able 
to detect the existence of the 
Higgs particle.
Nobel Prize in Chemistry
The 2013 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry was awarded to 
Martin Karplus of the Uni-
versité de Strasbourg, France 
and Harvard University; Mi-
chael Levitt of Stanford Uni-
versity; and Arieh Warshel 
of University of Southern 
California. Their work was 
recognized by the Nobel com-
mittee “for the development 
of multiscale models for com-
plex chemical systems.”
This trio of scientists is 
being praised for its work 
on computer programs — 
which started in the ’70s 
— that can help predict and 
record chemical processes. 
Because chemical reactions 
can happen at a fraction of a 
second, creating a program 
that would be able to map 
them out in real time was a 
daunting challenge. The im-
mense importance of these 
programs is especially visible 
in drug development. In the 
past, researchers had to test 
reactions on model organ-
isms such as mice; now they 
can simply see what happens 
on a computer screen.
New virus-killing 
process discovered
Researchers led by mi-
crobiology professor Shou-
Wei Ding, who heads a lab 
in the University of Califor-
nia, Riverside’s Institute for 
Integrative Genome Biol-
ogy, have discovered that 
mammals use the RNA in-
terference (RNAi) process 
to destroy viruses within 
their own cells like plants 
and invertebrate animals.
The team’s earlier re-
search into plants, nema-
todes, and fruit ?ies helped 
them ?nd the key: Viruses 
outwit the innate protection 
in cells by using proteins to 
suppress the virus-killing 
mechanism. Ding’s research 
discovered that remov-
ing the suppressor protein 
from the virus causes the 
subject’s body to quickly 
eliminate the virus using 
the RNAi process, which 
sends out small interfering 
RNAs (siRNAs) to kill the 
disease.

Deadly amoeba found in U.S.
State of?cials have con-
?rmed that the amoeba 
Naegleria fowleri has been 
found in a northern Loui-
siana parish’s water. The 
amoeba proves deadly if 
water is ingested through 
the nose, and has recently 
been identi?ed in Florida, 
Mississippi, and Arkansas. 
In response to the num-
ber of incidents in Louisi-
ana, state health of?cials 
announced they will imple-
ment new standards to 
kill the amoeba in water 
systems by increasing the 
amount of chlorine and 
ammonia they use to dis-
infect the water. The stan-
dards will exceed federal 
standards issued by the En-
vironmental Protection 
Agency. It is unclear if other 
states will follow suit.

Gas giants may rain diamonds
Studies suggest that on 
Jupiter and Saturn, it may 
rain diamonds. Theoreti-
cally, carbon soot particles, 
freed from methane par-
ticles in the planets’ upper 
atmosphere, would fall 
through heavy layers of hy-
drogen and helium toward 
the cores. On the way down, 
this carbon soot would be 
greatly condensed by high 
pressure and temperatures, 
thus leading to the forma-
tion of diamonds. 
By the time the dia-
monds neared the cores of 
each gas giant, they would 
likely have melted under 
such extreme heat and 
morphed into a liquid state, 
creating diamond rain.

Compost may hold fatal bacteria
Compost may harbor 
Legionella spp., the bacte-
ria responsible for Legion-
naire’s disease, a potentially 
deadly form of pneumonia. 
A recent study by research-
ers in the United Kingdom 
found the bacteria in 15 
out of 24 commercially 
available composts. Previ-
ous research identi?ed the 
bacteria in compost from 
Australia, Japan, and Swit-
zerland, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC). 
The CDC warns that 
Legionella infection risk is 
greater for older individu-
als, former smokers, chron-
ic lung disease patients and 
those with weakened im-
mune systems.

University must address gaps in blue lights
Carnegie Mellon currently has 
72 two-way emergency phones, ac-
cording to the university’s 2013 An-
nual Security and Fire Safety Report. 
To many students, these phones are 
known as blue lights. 
The phones are well-distributed 
throughout the main parts of cam-
pus, around academic buildings, and 
near the Cut, the Mall, and Gesling 
Stadium.
As Carnegie Mellon expands in 
accordance with its 10-year Master 
Plan, The Tartan hopes that the uni-
versity expands its blue light system, 
both into newly obtained and cur-
rently owned properties.
While the blue light system may 
not seem to some students an ef-
fective way to protect themselves 
against crime, it contributes to a 
safer campus atmosphere. More im-
portantly, this option for safety, if not 
available, could be costly to students’ 
well-being.
According to the 2013 Annual 
Security and Safety Report, there is 
only one blue light located on Craig 
Street near the University Police De-
partment. 
There are no blue lights within 
the vicinity of Fairfax Apartments 
or on Fifth Avenue between WQED 
and the Residence on Fifth. Further-
more, there are no blue lights near 
both Shirley Apartments and Web-
ster Hall. Fifth Avenue is a high-traf-
?c area for students living in these 
residences, especially since many 
students use the pathway between 
WQED and the Morewood parking 
lot to get to campus. Forbes Avenue 
presents a similar situation, as there 
are few easily accessible blue lights 
along the avenue, most notably near 
the Panther Hollow Inn. These ar-
eas are presumably more dangerous 
than areas that rest within the main 
part of campus, such as near Hunt 
Library or other academic build-
ings, where blue lights are already 
installed.
The university should attempt to 
?x these patches in its blue light sys-
tem. The lack of blue lights in these 
areas may be logistical, and would 
depend upon whether or not the uni-
versity owns property where it might 
place the lights. If this is the case, the 
university should work to place blue 
lights within the boundaries of its 
buildings’ properties, or work with 
the owners of properties that house 
Carnegie Mellon students, but are 
not owned by the university, to es-
tablish blue lights.
As the university expands over 
the next 10 years, Carnegie Mellon 
must place blue lights not only near 
new facilities that arise, but also near 
facilities that currently lack blue 
lights nearby.
Domestic abuse cannot be a taboo subject
October is Domestic Violence 
Awareness Month, but unfortunate-
ly, many people are unaware of it.
Started in 1987 by the National 
Coalition Against Domestic Violence 
(NCADV), this awareness campaign 
is highly under-recognized, but ex-
tremely important.
Many people are uncomfortable 
with the topic of domestic violence 
and often consider it taboo when dis-
cussing societal issues. Most cases of 
domestic violence are not reported 
to the police. 
Only one in four people report 
physical assaults by partners, and 
one in ?ve report rapes, says the 
NCADV. One in four women will be 
a victim of domestic abuse in her life-
time, according to the NCADV. 
Our society needs to become 
more open about discussing this sen-
sitive topic.
The effects of domestic violence 
extend beyond the scope of the im-
mediate victim. 
The NCADV reports that witness-
ing violence between parents is the 
strongest risk factor for carrying vio-
lent behavior into the next genera-
tion. This correlation is often seen in 
boys who witness domestic violence; 
they are twice as likely to abuse their 
own partners when they become 
adults.
Carnegie Mellon’s student life 
website has listed some community 
resources available for victims of do-
mestic abuse including the Alle-Kiski 
Area Hope Center, Womansplace, 
Inc., the Women’s Center & Shelter 
of Greater Pittsburgh, and Center for 
Victims of Violent Crime (CVVC).
The philanthropic efforts of Alpha 
Chi Omega also serve to break this 
barrier on campus. Each October, 
the sorority organizes an event titled 
Walk A Mile in Her Shoes, in which 
men are sponsored to wear women’s 
shoes. Proceeds go to the Pittsburgh 
Women’s Shelter and the national 
chapter of Alpha Chi Omega. The 
campus chapter also sponsors other 
events throughout the year to com-
bat domestic violence.
These efforts are admirable, and 
The Tartan hopes that similar efforts 
are enacted on larger scales world-
wide to break down the barriers 
preventing discussion of this issue. 
Domestic violence must become less 
taboo if we are to make any strides in 
preventing it.
Corbett should alter views on gay marriage
Army’s tattoo regulations 
suppress individuality
JUSTIN YAN
Junior Staffwriter
The tattoo, seen as exotic, pain-
ful, and rebellious, is a part of ev-
eryday expression: 23 percent of 
Americans have at least one tattoo, 
and 38 percent of 18-29 year olds 
have some sort of inking, according 
to a Pew Research poll conducted 
in 2010. David Beckham, once Eng-
land’s golden soccer boy, has sleeves 
?lled with ink. Angelina Jolie also 
has skin modi?cations over much 
of her body, all of which drew the 
press’s speculation as to what they 
mean.
A spokesman for the U.S. Army 
of?cially stated that the army “is a 
uniformed service where the public 
judges a soldier’s discipline in part 
by the manner in which he or she 
wears the uniform, as well as by the 
individual’s personal appearance,” 
according to The Wall Street Journal. 
Newly proposed regulations under 
?nal review by the army will not al-
low soldiers to have tattoos below 
the knee or elbow. This new restric-
tion has led to a spike in parlor visits 
from servicemen and women. Until 
now, tattoos were allowed every-
where except the face and neck. The 
army administration is not only try-
ing to combat this rising trend, but is 
also unnecessarily opposing its sub-
culture of tattooed soldiers.
In our current society, where 
people share personal information 
through Facebook posts and tweets, 
the popularity of tattoos makes 
sense. Walking around with a quota-
tion on the arm, a bald eagle on the 
shoulder, or a kanji symbol on the 
ankle all serves to tell random by-
standers who a person is and what 
they stand for. Tattoos are projec-
tions of things people like on Face-
book, the tweets they retweet, and 
everything in their life they hold 
dear, blended together and perma-
nently etched into their skin.
Let’s be honest: Tattoos add a 
sense of rebellion, danger, and ex-
citement to men and women. A poll 
conducted by Harris Interactive in 
2012 showed that 30 percent of tat-
tooed people feel more sexy with 
their tattoos, while 25 percent say 
they make them feel more rebel-
lious. 21 percent of tattooed people 
say that tattoos make them feel sexy 
or strong.
Where does this image of tat-
toos come from? For one, the hippie 
culture in the 1960s created much 
of the association of countercul-
ture with tattoos, according to the 
National Post. That’s where the re-
bellious nature of tattoos comes in. 
PBS says that during World War II — 
the golden age of tattoos — U.S. sol-
diers and U.S. Navy sailors often felt 
lost in the large number of uniforms, 
and were the ?rst large subculture 
to have some sort of inking. Sail-
ors would often have engravings of 
scantily clad women on their arms, 
furthering the rebellious and risqué 
subculture of tattoos in the Armed 
Forces. Now, the army’s administra-
tion, countering the popular stereo-
type, wants the Armed Forces to be 
presented as clean cut, according to 
The Wall Street Journal.
These new restrictions sever sol-
diers’ rights to express themselves. 
“Every tattoo I have on my body 
says something about who I am, 
where I’m from, or the things I’ve 
been through,” said First Sergeant 
Aki Paylor in an article published 
by the of?cial website of the United 
States Army, speci?cally mention-
ing his “warrior ethos” tattoo. Mili-
tary personnel go through intensive 
training, get thrown under remark-
able pressure, and are often lost in 
a mass of shaved heads and unifor-
mity. It seems normal for them to 
have a need to illustrate their iden-
tity among the sea of camou?age 
uniforms. Not only could tattoos 
help others recognize who someone 
is behind the uniform and haircut, it 
could help soldiers themselves to re-
alize who they were, are, and want 
to be. 
Being in the military — not even 
on the front lines — can be an im-
mensely stressful experience, and 
a solid surface for military person-
nel to hold onto could be incredibly 
comforting. That solid surface is 
their body inking.
The army 
administration ... 
is unnecessarily 
opposing its 
subculture of 
tattooed soldiers.

In a recent interview with WHP-
TV in Harrisburg, Governor Tom 
Corbett (R-Pa.) recently compared 
the idea of legalizing gay marriage 
to the idea of legalizing incest. Ac-
cording to the Los Angeles Times, on 
Oct. 4 he apologized for his recent 
court ?ling that initially compared 
the marriage of gay couples to child 
marriage on the basis that both are 
illegal in Pennsylvania.
Corbett acknowledged unsarcas-
tically, “It was an inappropriate anal-
ogy, you know. I think a much better 
analogy would have been brother 
and sister, don’t you?” While he later 
apologized for this comparison, after 
outrage from the gay community, 
this is indicative of the uninformed 
and out-of-touch mindset of legisla-
tors who oppose gay marriage.
Corbett is far from the ?rst na-
tional politician to exhibit such in-
sensitivity toward the issue of gay 
rights, let alone the ?rst Pennsylva-
nia politician. Most notably, former 
Pennsylvania Senator Rick San-
torum is notorious for his opposi-
tion to gay rights. According to The 
Huf?ngton Post, he has stated his 
belief that legalizing gay marriage 
would discourage future heterosexu-
al marriages. He has also stated that 
legalizing gay marriage would lead 
to the legalization of bigamy, incest, 
and polygamy, according to CNN.
The conservative evangelical 
policy makers that hold these views 
not only ?nd themselves out of touch 
with their constituents, but in some 
cases, also with their own religions. 
While not completely in line with 
increasingly popular views on gay 
rights, the Church of Latter-day 
Saints has made strides for openness 
and acceptance toward homosexual 
individuals. According to Time mag-
azine, Mormon leaders have backed 
the Boy Scouts of America’s move to 
allow openly gay scouts, and church 
leaders no longer advise gay mem-
bers to marry only people of the op-
posite sex. The Catholic Church has 
similarly seen some progress. Ac-
cording to CNN, Pope Francis stated 
in July, “If someone is gay and he 
searches for the Lord and has good 
will, who am I to judge?” 
While religious institutions may 
still oppose gay marriage, they ex-
press greater degrees of acceptance 
than Corbett.
It is time for politicians to do their 
research, become more conscious of 
the scope of gay rights, and better 
re?ect the views of their constituents 
and their religious beliefs. 
If Corbett fails to adopt a more 
accepting stance similar to other 
conservative ?gures and institu-
tions, he may lose the support of his 
constituents.

A PERSON’S OPINION

Compiled by Jonathan Leung
The Tartan is ready to relax for fall break. So we asked,
How much time during it do you plan to devote to homework?
It’s a shutdown, not a showdown
BRANDON SCHMUCK
Junior Staffwriter
“We’ve been told to make life as 
dif?cult for people as we can. It’s 
disgusting,” said a national park ser-
vice ranger who was disturbed by 
instructions received from a boss, 
according to The Atlantic Wire. The 
United States has strictly enforced 
the closure of its national park ser-
vices due to the government shut-
down and has gone as far as putting 
more effort into restricting citizens 
from entering parks than it has sim-
ply allowing them to remain open.
Because Congress has been un-
able to agree on a budget, it makes 
sense that national parks have been 
unable to operate; ?nancial fund-
ing is required to operate anything. 
However, what does not make sense 
is that, while the government has 
suspended their national park ser-
vices, they have continued to keep a 
number of service members on the 
payroll, simply to restrict American 
citizens from accessing the parks.
Perhaps one of the most disturb-
ing cases of this restriction is the 
World War II Memorial. As an open-
air monument, it is available to citi-
zens 24 hours a day. The monument 
was constructed almost entirely 
on private funding with $197 mil-
lion in donations. There are little 
to no resources required to operate 
this monument, besides perhaps a 
guard or two. However, it has been 
physically barricaded from the pub-
lic, and several workers have been 
put on guard to ensure that citizens 
cannot access it, according to Time 
magazine.
According to Fox News, Rep. Ja-
son Smith (R-Mo.) stated on the 
House ?oor last Tuesday that the 
Federal government is currently put-
ting forth more resources to pay Fed-
eral workers to barricade the Ameri-
can people out of some national 
monuments than it does to actually 
operate them. These initiatives are 
nothing but a political game.
The idea that the closure of the 
World War II Memorial and others is 
a political game is only strengthened 
when one considers that the Repub-
lican National Committee offered to 
pay $150,000 a month to keep the 
monument open to the public during 
the course of the shutdown, accord-
ing to The Daily Caller. They obvi-
ously wanted to make the Democrats 
look like the bad guys. In turn, the 
fact that the Obama Administra-
tion informed the Republicans that 
they cannot legally accept this offer 
shows that they do not want to make 
the Republican Party look like the 
good guys.
The Obama Administration and 
the Democratic Party clearly want 
to make the impact of the shutdown 
as widespread as possible, in order 
to cause the Republican Party’s ap-
proval ratings to plummet. If this is 
their objective, they have been suc-
cessful so far. 
According to MSNBC, only 5 per-
cent of Americans currently approve 
of Congress. Moreover, an Associ-
ated Press-GfK Group survey found 
that 62 percent of Americans placed 
the blame on Republicans for the 
government shutdown.
Sadly, this shutdown simply re-
?ects the entire problem with Wash-
ington. It is currently a duopoly 
where the primary objective of each 
party is to defeat the other. 
This mindset is why this shut-
down has lasted this long. Both par-
ties want to look like the hero, and 
neither is willing to budge to the 
other.
Fox’s news deck fails to blast off
JUSTIN MCGOWN
You would be forgiven for tuning 
into Fox News in the near future and 
thinking that the entire newsroom 
is en route to Mars. The cable news 
channel has rebuilt its newsroom 
into what it calls a News Deck. The 
News Deck has been equipped with 
a dizzying array of technology de-
signed to help the station provide up-
dates to the new non-linear viewer. 
Non-linear viewers don’t sit down 
and watch TV regularly, but rather 
“tune in on [their] time,” according 
to Fox News anchor Shepard Smith.
Combating the threat of the 
uninformed non-linear viewer re-
quires employees to use “Big Area 
Touchscreens”, 55-inch screens 
that can be used to  trawl social 
media for posts containing trend-
ing buzzwords. There is also now 
a 30-foot-long screen on which an-
chors can move photos around with 
a Wii Remote-like wand. The peo-
ple operating the pointlessly large 
screens will be the journalists who 
would normally be at desks working 
on stories, who can now have their 
work stations broadcast to millions 
of viewers at a moment’s notice.
Why? Because there are tweets, 
Facebook posts, and a host of unvet-
ted information out there to share 
with viewers. Because the viewer 
doesn’t tune into the news for ac-
curate information. You tune in to 
hear what the Internet thinks, and 
the best way to do that is by putting 
the people who do the most impor-
tant work in the organization on the 
bridge of the Enterprise so they can 
get sensory overload.
Sarcasm aside, Fox News is not 
alone in the “news as entertainment” 
movement on television. However, 
the station is taking this movement 
to new and ridiculous heights while 
eroding what bits of journalistic in-
tegrity it had left. 
The station is aiming to provide 
even more coverage of frequently un-
reliable social media posts, despite 
recent embarrassments suffered by 
many major television news sources. 
It is selling these posts to viewers 
with ?ashing lights and unnecessary 
moving images.
No part of this revamped News 
Deck contributes to good reporting; 
None of it actually helps the viewer. 
News sources need to provide facts 
and, in the case of Fox News, right-
leaning opinions. Trying to give 
viewers a seizure with more screens 
than you are likely to ?nd on the 
bridge of a modern aircraft carrier is 
not the way to do it. This newsroom 
is perhaps the most visible example 
imaginable of favoring ?ash over 
substance, since Fox News stated 
that its intent is to do even less origi-
nal coverage and, instead, let the In-
ternet provide it with content.
In the video tour of the deck, 
Smith mentions that modern view-
ers have changed their preferences 
for learning about a story; they now 
follow the news on phones and com-
puters. Instead of trying to provide 
something unique — offering a bet-
ter or more effective in-depth story 
— the station is trying to offer more 
of the same. Fox News seems sure 
that others will imitate their News 
Deck, but with luck they will strike 
an asteroid instead.

Share blame for the world’s climate shame
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
Junior Staffwriter
An article published in last 
week’s issue of The Tartan titled 
“Address global warming to side-
step dire effects” stated that people 
of ?rst world nations must aid those 
whom they have affected, seeing as 
?rst world nations have contributed 
most of the pollution that is perpetu-
ating global warming.
But who is to blame for this cli-
mate change? Most would point ?n-
gers at these so-called ?rst world na-
tions and with due cause. According 
to CNN, 20 percent of the world’s 
wealthiest nations are responsible 
for 80 percent of global emissions. 
Meanwhile, the one billion poor-
est people in the world are respon-
sible for a mere 3 percent of global 
emissions. 
Evidently, wealthy nations con-
tribute most to environmental deg-
radation while developing countries 
are doomed to experience the worst 
effects of climate change. In fact, 
University of California, Berkeley 
professor Richard Norgaard said on 
CNN that the environmental debt 
the world’s wealthiest nations owe 
to the poorest exceeds the estimated 
third world debt by over $4 billion.
However, when discussing envi-
ronmental degradation, individuals 
must be considered above nations. 
Carbon footprint levels do not trav-
el with national identity, but they 
might very well come paired with a 
person’s income.
Developing nations such as Chi-
na, India, and Brazil are producing 
millionaires at increasingly higher 
rates. The rise of these new rich, 
coupled with the expansion of mid-
dle classes in developing countries, 
has dangerous implications for the 
environment. Increases in standard 
of living — modeled after Western 
consumer culture — must be tied 
inexorably to high levels of con-
sumption. In addition, the two most 
prominent developing countries — 
India and China — are home to over 
35 percent of the world’s popula-
tion, according to the International 
Business Times. There is real imme-
diate danger in these nations aiming 
to live like Americans; population 
blog Per Square Mile says that if ev-
eryone did, we would need about 
four planet Earths.
Ultimately, many environmental 
problems are beyond the scope of 
a single nation. Policing the world’s 
greatest common resource — the 
ocean — is impossible without col-
laboration, and who can say where 
one nation’s air stops and another’s 
begins? Most other limited re-
sources only fall under the jurisdic-
tion of a nation through the luck of 
geography. All efforts to save the 
environment must therefore be col-
laborative, with countries working 
together to salvage the only planet 
they will ever have.
Still, many developed nations 
have a habit of standing apart from 
the pack in negative ways. The Unit-
ed States is notorious for bowing 
out of international environmental 
treaties, most memorably the 1997 
Kyoto Treaty for reducing carbon 
emissions. America was one of few 
industrialized nations not to ratify, 
and the treaty suffered a serious 
blow to its clout without the backing 
of such an internationally crucial 
player.
Clearly, developed nations must 
tackle their own lacking environ-
mental policies before citing any 
kind of moral obligation to help 
developing countries rise to their 
level. This idea of a moral obligation 
suggests that the United States and 
similar nations intrinsically know 
much better than the leaders, scien-
tists, and activists of a nation what is 
best for their nation’s development, 
which is hypocrisy on an extreme 
scale.
America remains the nation 
with the largest carbon footprint 
per capita by carbon dioxide emis-
sions — a position it has held with-
out shame for decades, according to 
Postconsumers.com. Although Chi-
na takes ?rst place for carbon emis-
sions overall, China is distinguishing 
itself as impressively progressive 
in dealing with the environmental 
consequences of rapid industrial-
ization. No other evidence can bet-
ter disprove the insulting idea that 
developed nations somehow owe 
developing countries their expertise 
on matters of environmentally sus-
tainable progress.
Perhaps placing blame is point-
less. It certainly wastes time that 
could be better spent by taking a 
hard look at how our own actions 
are impacting the environment. Af-
ter all, if individuals can hold great 
responsibility for degrading the en-
vironment, they also have the power 
to enact lasting positive change.

Before clouds covered the 
Pittsburgh sky, the sun shined 
long enough on Saturday 
morning for the men’s and 
women’s cross country teams’ 
Carnegie Mellon Invitational.
The men’s cross coun-
try team, led by senior Josh 
Newby’s second-place ?nish 
(25:47.8), took home ?rst in 
the eight-kilometer race.
The women ?nished third 
in their ?ve-kilometer race. 
Junior Erin Kiekhaefer ?n-
ished ?rst (19:03.5) for the 
Tartans and eighth overall, 
while sophomore Rekha 
Schnepf (19:32.9) ?nished 
second.
The top ?ve ?nishes for 
each team determine the 
team’s ?nal score.
The race started at the 
Schenley Oval in Schenley 
Park. The course included the 
Upper Panther Hollow and 
the Bridle Trails.
“I thought the women did 
very well in grouping them-
selves together. I know that 
their grouping was good, and 
my one-to-?ve split was very 
good, so I’m pleased with 
that,” said head coach Dario 
Donatelli.
Sophomore Priya Patel 
and senior Catherine Pa-
quette ?nished together with 
times of 19:53.2 and 19:53.9, 
respectively.
First-year Rachel McCoy 
rounded out the women’s 
top ?ve with her 32nd-place 
?nish.
For the men’s team, both 
current and former athletes 
showed impressive times. The 
Carnegie Mellon Alumni team 
?nished third and had three 
runners ?nish in the top 10.
The current squad blew 
away the entire ?eld. Its top 
?ve ?nishes were within the 
?rst 13.
Newby, who ?nished third 
overall last year, continued his 
success in the invitational.
“I felt really good. This 
is our home course — it’s a 
confusing and strange course 
— but our team knows the 
course really well so we knew 
when to go,” Newby said.
“He looked like he got into 
a nice group. When I saw him 
on the trail, at two miles and 
four miles, he was just gliding 
along,” Donatelli said.
Senior Ken Murphy was 
the next Tartan to ?nish, com-
ing in at eighth overall.
Junior George Degen and 
sophomores Marc-Daniel 
Julien and Brian Bollens 
took places 11, 12, and 13 
respectively.
The strong ?nish for the 
Tartans comes at a good time, 
as the teams prepare for the 
University Athletic Associa-

SPORTS COMMENTARYPenguins hope for improved results in the realigned NHL
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
For the ?rst time since their 
re-emergence as Stanley Cup 
contenders, the Pittsburgh 
Penguins seem to be overshad-
owed by the other Pittsburgh 
professional teams. The com-
bination of the Pirates’ ?rst 
playoff berth in over 20 years 
and the Steelers’ abysmal 1–4 
start has stolen most of the 
focus away from Pittsburgh’s 
hockey franchise. 
The surprisingly early start 
to the season, compared to last 
year’s lock-out-delayed Janu-
ary start, has most Pittsbur-
ghers unaware that the Pen-
guins are already ?ve games 
into their season.
For better or worse, the 
Penguins are returning a 
squad very similar to the one 
that was embarassingly swept 
by the Boston Bruins in last 
year’s Eastern Conference 
Finals.
The main losses are the vet-
erans the Penguins acquired 
last season in trades to push 
themselves over the edge: For-
wards Jarome Iginla and Bren-
den Morrow, and defenseman 
Douglas Murray all left via 
free agency.
Left wing Jussi Jokinen was 
the one player to stick around 
after the Pens acquired him. 
Twenty-one-year-old forward 
Beau Bennett looks to be the 
future top-line winger. As 
alternate captain Evgeni Mal-
kin and captain Sidney Crosby 
get older, the Penguins hope 
Bennett can develop and make 
up for the two’s decreased 
production. But as of now, he 
is too inexperienced to play 
the physical style demanded 
by the line of Malkin and left 
wing James Neal. 
Expect to see Jokinen start 
the season, with Bennett 
jumping up in the depth chart 
as he gets more comfortable 
on the ice.
On defense, the Penguins 
return the same mediocre 
group of players. In fact, they 
are even worse off, with top-
scoring defenseman Kris Le-
tang out with a lower body 
injury. With their third-lead-
ing point scorer from last sea-
son out inde?nitely, the Pens 
could be without some of the 
offensive ?repower that has 
kept them competitive the last 
few years in spite of their po-
rous defense and inconsistent 
goaltending.
Speaking of goaltending, 
the Penguins still have the 
same question marks that they 
have had the past few sea-
sons. Goaltender Marc-Andre 
Fleury has been one of the top 
regular season goalies the past 
two seasons, but during the 
playoffs of those two seasons, 
his play has been atrocious. 
Since goaltending is such a 
mentally challenging posi-
tion, it will be interesting to 
see how Fleury bounces back 
from being benched in last 
year’s playoffs. It’s even more 
critical that Fleury be on his 
game since Tomas Vokoun, 
the goalie who took over for 
Fleury, is out for the next 3–6 
months with blood clots, leav-
ing Fleury without a veteran 
backup.
The biggest change to the 
Penguins comes in the form of 
the NHL conference realign-
ment. With the 2011 move of 
the Atlanta Thrashers to Win-
nipeg and being renamed the 
Jets, the NHL needed to shuf-
?e up its divisions and confer-
ences. There are still two con-
ferences, the 14-team Western 
Conference and the 16-team 
Eastern Conference, but now 
instead of six ?ve-team divi-
sions, there are only four total 
divisions, with two in each 
conference. 
This realignment has ?xed 
many years of illogical geo-
graphic divisions due to the 
mass movement of teams from 
smaller northeastern United 
States and Canadian cities, 
down to the Sun Belt rang-
ing from Florida to Texas and 
Arizona. It is also only a trial 
run due to unbalanced con-
ferences and divisions, and 
the threat of relocation by the 
Phoenix Coyotes and several 
other southern teams.
This change in divisional 
format has also affected the 
playoff system. Each division 
will have three automatic 
playoff quali?ers, with two 
more wild card teams coming 
from the top two remaining 
teams in the conference. The 
second and third seeds from 
each division will play each 
other in the ?rst round of the 
playoffs, and the top seed in 
each division will play one of 
the wild card teams, with the 
overall top seed playing the 
weaker wild card. 
The winners of those two 
series within each division 
will play each other for the 
divisional championship, and 
the winners of the divisional 
championships will play each 
other for the conference cham-
pionship. The two conference 
winners will then play for the 
Stanley Cup.
One of the major criticisms 
of this system is the impact of 
division strength in playoff 
berths and ease. If one divi-
sion is signi?cantly weaker 
than another, it will give top 
teams in that division a much 
easier road to the conference 
?nals, allowing them to rest 
their players and have a leg up 
on the competition.
The Penguins are in the 
newly formed Metropolitan 
Division within the Eastern 
Conference. They are still with 
all of their old Atlantic Divi-
sion foes — the New Jersey 
Devils, both New York teams, 
and their cross-state rivals the 
Philadelphia Flyers — but are 
also adding the Washington 
Capitals, the Carolina Hurri-
canes, and the Columbus Blue 
Jackets, who are moving from 
the Western Conference.
Even with all the changes 
in the NHL, the Penguins’ big-
gest challenges come from 
within. Since they won the 
Stanley Cup in 2009, the team 
has only grown and improved. 
But their biggest foes have 
been injuries and inconsistent 
play. 
If Crosby and Malkin can 
stay on the ice, and Fleury 
can get his head straight and 
play in the postseason like he 
has during the regular season, 
look for another deep playoff 
run. Otherwise, look for an-
other postseason full of disap-
pointment.

To become the Division 
III Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association (ITA) National 
Singles Champion, sopho-
more Abhishek Alla had to 
defeat six opponents — two 
of them from his own team — 
in the ITA Southeast regional 
tournament, and three other 
regional champions.
His immediate reaction 
upon becoming singles-
champion: “Just a smile I 
guess.”
The even-keeled Alla 
cruised to victory, not drop-
ping a set in the national tour-
nament. His dominance is 
nothing new; in the regional 
tournament, he dropped only 
one set, which came against 
teammate junior William 
Duncan in the quarter?nals.
Alla entered the tourna-
ment with tempered expec-
tations — “Let’s just take it 
match by match,” he said — 
and took the ?rst match to 
?nd his groove.
Against No. 4 seed Pax-
ton Deuel of Trinity Univer-
sity last Thursday, Alla found 
himself trailing the ?rst set 
5–4. After holding serve to 
tie the set at 5–5, Alla broke 
Deuel’s serve and held his 
serve again to win the set.
Deuel fought back, win-
ning the ?rst three games of 
the second set. But Alla re-
grouped and won the next six 
games to take the match.
“I wouldn’t say [I was] 
nervous, but the other guy 
was consistent. He was just 
getting the balls back, so I 
was like — I should do the 
same.... It was a long ?rst 
match,” he said.
Alla crushed his next two 
opponents. He beat Sam Gei-
er from Kenyon College 6–2, 
6–0 in the semi?nals.
In the ?nal match on Sat-
urday, he defeated Skylar 
Butts of the Claremont Col-
leges 6–4, 6–1 to take home 
the championship title.
Alla said his recent play 
is the best since coming to 
Carnegie Mellon but not his 
best overall.
“I’ve probably played bet-
ter before I came to CMU.”
That Alla has even more 
room to develop should be 
terrifying to opponents and 
good news to the men’s ten-
nis team as they try to make 
the NCAA Division III tourna-
ment next May.
Despite proving his skills 
on the court, Alla admits 
his serve could always use 
more work: “I’m trying. If it 
gets better, it gets better, or 
else it’s just going to stay the 
same,” he said. His serve may 
not be the most powerful, 
but now, it is the serve of a 
champion.

Bassnectar plays energetic set
The electronic dance musician offers a sensory overload
Over 2,000 people were gathered at Stage AE last 
Monday at around 9:30 p.m., anxiously awaiting the 
moment when the house lights would turn down and 
the dull music filling the silence would be cut off. 
Some of these people looked like they had just come 
from work, while others looked like they’d never 
worked a day in their life. Some were dressed head 
to toe in neon and glitter, while others wore nearly 
nothing at all.
An outsider looking in might ask, what could 
possibly bring together all these people, from 
seemingly all different sects of society? The answer: 
Bassnectar.
Lorin Ashton — also known as Bassnectar — is one 
of the biggest names in the American electronic 
dance music movement. Producing a signature 
brand of dubstep that samples everything from 
hip-hop to heavy metal, Ashton has been releasing 
music under the name Bassnectar since 2001. In 
addition, he has been touring consistently since 
2005, and throughout his career he has gradually 
gained a reputation as one of the most skilled artists 
of the electronic genre in terms of live performance. 
Unlike many other electronic artists who employ a 
“push play” method of live performance that involves 
very little effort on their part, Ashton instead mixes 
tracks on the spot. This approach ensures that 
Bassnectar shows are both extremely energetic and 
very distinct from each other.
It’s not just his technical skill that makes the 
Bassnectar experience a memorable one, however. 
The sound system he employs is loud enough to 
make your entire body shake involuntarily, and the 
massive screen that towers behind him flashes 
incessantly with everything from abstract visuals to 
a series of clips from Disney’s Alice in Wonderland. 
A Bassnectar concert is a microcosm of what it’s like 
to live in the modern era: a constant and unrelenting 
sensory overload.
While sticking primarily to his impressive wealth 
of original material, Ashton also gave some other 
artists’ tunes — such as Kid Cudi’s modern classic 
“Day ‘n’ Nite” and Azealia Banks’s hit “212” — the 
Bassnectar treatment. It was pretty disorienting to 
hear the voice of Bruno Mars singing “Locked Out 
Of Heaven” over the heavy womps and hard-hitting 
drums, but everyone’s allowed a few mistakes.
Any kind of human gathering this large and 
spirited is a pretty beautiful thing. Ages ranged 
from the teens to the 30s, but that was no matter: 
Everyone was simply there to dance away and 
enjoy the music, without worrying about tomorrow. 
Approximately 20 minutes into his over-two-hour 
set, the music suddenly cut out and Ashton started 
walking off the stage. The puzzled crowd began to 
shout, bringing the long-haired virtuoso back toward 
the microphone. “It’s Monday night; don’t you guys 
have work and s*** tomorrow?”
A sold-out Stage AE uniformly responded in the 
negative, and the assault on the senses resumed.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Matt,
I don’t really understand 
most of your jokes. I 
mean, I do, but it usually 
takes me a while and 
you just sit there with 
this blank look on your 
face like, “Holy crow, I 
just made the best joke 
of my life and you’re 
not laughing in support 
of it.” To be fair, I don’t 
laugh that hard at jokes 
anyway, but I feel there 
is a distinct disconnect 
between your punchlines 
and my comprehending 
them (maybe I’m not 
always sure when you’re 
joking). I do get your 
jokes in the end, and 
that’s what counts, right?
Sincerely,
Really Yucks Afterwards, 
Nonvoluntarily
Dear RYAN,
It’s not you; it’s me. Wait, are 
we breaking up? You always 
seem to have seen all the 
goofy stuff that I’m exposed 
to. I thought we shared so 
much knowledge of Internet 
and television pop culture 
that at any joke or reference I 
make, you will catch the line 
and rib on it further. If I can’t 
show you funny Internet 
cats, maybe I can make you 
laugh about what happens 
when a room temperature 
superconductor walks into 
a bar. The bartender tells 
him to leave, and he does 
so, without putting up any 
resistance. No? Okay. I’ll go 
for slapstick next time.
Everybody laughs at 
people slipping on banana 
peels, right?
Matt
Dear Ryan,
I can never seem to get 
you to laugh at my jokes. I 
don’t know what’s wrong; 
do they just go over your 
head? I suppose we need 
to do some impedance 
matching because I am 
an ECE major and you 
are a physics major, but 
I thought we were both 
sufficiently nerdy that 
the relationship would 
work. Do you not value 
all the time we’ve spent 
together?
Sincerely, 
Meaning Absent, Truly 
Tried
Dear MATT,
That right there is a loaded 
question. Of course I value 
the time we’ve spent, but 
… maybe … maybe it’s not 
you. Maybe it’s me. You 
know? Because you … 
you’re a really funny guy. 
Like, seriously. You tell really 
good jokes. 
But, I don’t know … maybe 
I’m just not attuned to your 
sense of humor. Or maybe 
… maybe I just don’t like 
your sense of humor. I know 
that’s hard to hear (or rather, 
read), but it could be true. 
Regardless, I’ve been trying 
hard to understand your 
jokes, and I think I’ve been 
getting better at getting them 
sooner, so … bear with me.
I still don’t entirely 
understand the hydrogen 
joke,
Ryan

Revolution: It’s a term that comes to mind when thinking 
about the world today. Regimes are overthrown in 
the Middle East, and forces like the Tea Party and the 
Occupy movement call for dramatic changes to our own 
government. Even from a non-political perspective, we 
live in a time of great change, with smartphones, Twitter, 
and a whole array of social technologies that change 
how we get and share information.
This idea of revolution is the thematic core of Without 
Their Permission, a memoir by Alexis Ohanian, the 
30-year-old co-founder of popular viral-content website 
reddit. Throughout the book, Ohanian discusses the 
origins of the companies and websites he helped 
create, gives advice for those also interested in 
entrepreneurship, and emphasizes the importance of the 
open environment that helped facilitate such growth in 
the tech sector.
Ohanian starts off with childhood stories about his 
family, where his entrepreneurial spirit takes root. The 
anecdotes are often humorous: Ohanian describes 
pitching software to uninterested customers at 
CompUSA as a 14-year-old and recalls fellow reddit co-
founder Steve Huffman’s disappointment that the Alexis 
across the hall in his ?rst-year dorm was, in fact, not a 
girl.
Throughout the book, Ohanian imbues his stories with a 
sarcastic humor that helps portray him as a fully ?eshed-
out individual. When reprinting an email he once sent 
to Huffman, he apologizes that the keyboard he used 
to type it must have had a broken button that inserted 
“bro” throughout the email. It’s self-deprecating, and it’s 
good to see such a successful entrepreneur make fun of 
himself.
Ohanian focuses heavily on the concept of gatekeepers: 
how media for art, products, and creativity once had 
to go through a middleman before reaching public 
exposure. Musicians had record labels, ?lmmakers had 
studios, and software developers needed distributors. 
But now, in an age when musicians like Macklemore and 
Ryan Lewis can release an album independently and 
have it go platinum, there is no gatekeeper. Distribution 
is as easy as posting something online, and public 
exposure depends on whether the masses deem it 
worthy of their time.
He emphasizes how this environment of an open 
Internet was crucial to the founding and continued 
success of reddit and nearly every other web giant out 
there. On this note, he heavily discusses the threat to 
this Internet openness that reared its ugly head last year 
through deliberations over the Stop Online Piracy Act 
(SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA).
It would have been interesting if Ohanian had tackled 
the issues that SOPA and PIPA created from a technical 
or entrepreneurial perspective. The truly compelling 
point to his discussion, however, is how non-technical 
people have taken advantage of an open Internet 
to change the world for the better. One example is 
that of Debby Guardino, a special education teacher 
from Virginia who utilized crowdfunding website 
DonorsChoose.org to raise over $800,000 for schools 
in Joplin, Mo., after it was hit with an EF5 tornado in 
May 2011. Ohanian emphasizes that without an open 
Internet, one of the only job sectors that saw growth 
throughout the Great Recession — technology — would 
be crucially hindered, and an entire medium for global 
humanitarianism would be rendered inoperable.
Without Their Permission is a good read, whether you 
are a budding tech entrepreneur or just have a passing 
interest in the Internet (which in this day and age should 
include everyone). Though at times Ohanian may come 
off as cocky — as evidenced by the title of the book and 
his unnecessarily repeated emphasis that you don’t have 
to ask for permission to change the world — Ohanian’s 
stories are earnest and inspiring. Whether it’s his advice 
on how to get your startup company going, or how one 
act of kindness can have such a ripple effect on the Web, 
the reader walks away understanding what the Internet 
ultimately is: a revolution.

Emma Approved gives Austen a modern spin
The Pemberley Digital web series strives to recreate the success of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries
Emma Approved, the latest collaboration between Bernie 
Su and Hank Green of Pemberley Digital, premiered 
online last Monday. The duo formed the production 
company Pemberley Digital after their success with 
web series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, which captured 
the hearts of viewers and went on to win two Streamy 
Awards and an Emmy for Outstanding Creative 
Achievement in Interactive Media.
Emma Approved, was announced at VidCon 2013, a 
conference for online video creators, as an adaptation 
of Jane Austen’s Emma, a novel about a matchmaking 
young woman who doesn’t exactly have her own life 
together.
Pemberley Digital’s Emma (Joanna Sotomura) is a 
20-something member of the Highbury Lifestyle Group, 
Matchmaking and Lifestyle Division: In short, she’s an 
online matchmaker. She’s an opinionated, fast-talking 
perfectionist who doesn’t have time for “business 
development, book-keeping, boring stuff” — that’s the 
division of her business partner and future love interest 
Alex Knightley (Brent Bailey).
The series is a compilation of the vlog-style videos 
Emma makes in preparation for the inevitable 
documentary celebrating her future achievements. Su 
described this Emma as “Oprah for the YouTube Age” 
to thevideoink.com, a characterization upheld by Emma 
herself. She says she will one day “be like Oprah … 
but better!” — giving everyone a better love life just as 
Oprah gives out cars.
The ?rst episode is a true pilot, introducing viewers 
to Emma and her world. She begins by reading a 
short snippet of an article written about her, lauding 
her success as a professional matchmaker. In this 
?rst episode, she’s on the verge of perfect success 
number 20: the marriage between cupcake mogul Ryan 
Weston (Gabriel Voss) and power homemaker Annie 
Taylor (Alexis Boozer). When Alex comes in to discuss 
business, viewers are able to see the playful relationship 
between the pair, which will eventually develop into a 
romance.
In the second episode, Alex’s role is a little more ?eshed 
out: He’s there to make Emma think about the serious 
stuff, like what will happen if her perfect success rate 
is broken. It becomes obvious to the viewer that Emma 
doesn’t like to think about the negatives and only 
confronts the possibility of failure when forced to do so.
With an already-rabid fan base (which raised over 700 
percent of the Kickstarter goal to fund The Lizzie Bennet 
Diaries DVD set), Internet success doesn’t seem like 
much of a problem for Emma Approved. However, it’s 
the small things, like Emma’s over-the-top winks to the 
camera, that could sink the project. The team should be 
wary of making Emma too self-con?dent.
Before beginning to write Emma, Jane Austen wrote, “I 
am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will 
much like.” Austen’s Emma meddled in other people’s 
lives, but she did so with only the best intentions. When 
she was wrong, she tried to make it right. Although the 
character has remained a classic, updating her story to 
the 21st century could prove disastrous. With so much 
technology at her disposal, Emma could lose sight of the 
good intentions at the heart of her meddling.
Even the idea of matchmaking for money seems a little 
out of character: Is she in it for the cash, or does she truly 
want to see people happy? Pemberley Digital needs to 
make sure that their Emma is still likeable and relatable, 
or else the audience will lose interest.
Installments of Emma Approved are released at 1 p.m. 
on Mondays and Wednesdays, with additional content 
released throughout the week.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for the ?rst 
episode of American Horror Story: Coven, as well as 
spoilers for the ?rst two seasons.
The third season of American Horror Story premiered 
Wednesday amid a whirlwind of high expectations. Its 
second season was nominated for 17 Emmys, and for the 
most part, the ?rst episode — titled “Bitchcraft” — lived 
up to expectations.
This season, called American Horror Story: Coven, 
revolves around a coven of witches living in New 
Orleans at Miss Robichaux’s Academy for Exceptional 
Young Ladies. Here, four young women are taught to 
hone their powers by headmistress Cordelia Foxx, played 
by returning cast member Sarah Paulson.
The show’s various settings promise to lend themselves 
to an interesting season. The story jumps between 19th-
century and present-day New Orleans, and it is already 
apparent that boiling tensions from events in the 1800s 
will resonate in the present as the season progresses. 
The academy is stunning with its whitewash hardwood 
?ooring and ornate marble staircase, and the mansion is 
brimming with tension. The four student witches have 
already shown cracks in their solidarity, with Queenie 
(Gabourey Sidibe) injuring Madison Montgomery (Emma 
Roberts) with an act of voodoo halfway through the 
episode.
As per usual, the show presents a strong cast of 
characters who are sure to cause a stir.
“Darling, you have outdone yourself. How ever did you 
think this up?” asks a man — presumably Madame 
Delphine LaLaurie’s husband — during the episode’s 
opening sequence, set in 1834 New Orleans, as a young 
slave of hers places the head of a bull upon another 
slave. LaLaurie, played by Kathy Bates, is based on the 
historical ?gure of the same name who is now infamous 
for torturing her slaves.
Bates is a new addition to the repertoire of talented 
actresses who grace the show, and her appearance 
shows promise. Bates’s character is the most exciting 
in the episode, with the rift she has created between 
herself and Angela Bassett’s voodoo practitioner Marie 
Laveau, her reappearance in present-day New Orleans, 
and her truly disturbing rituals like nightly blood facials 
to tighten her ?abby skin.
Returning to the cast after their absences from season 
two are Taissa Farmiga and Jamie Brewer, who played 
Violet Harmon and Adelaide Langdon respectively in 
season one. Their returns are welcome — especially that 
of Brewer, who plays a witch student, Nan, gifted with 
clairvoyance. Nan provides a sense of tension through 
her all-knowing and mysterious personality. Meanwhile, 
Farmiga’s character, Zoe Benson, promises to be a 
strong character who seeks justice in any way she can.
The show’s opening titles are impressive. As in past 
seasons, the titles are accompanied by creepy imagery 
consistent with the season’s themes, as well as the 
show’s disturbing theme music. Gone are the worn 
baby pictures and disturbed asylum inmates of the last 
seasons, replaced by voodoo dolls and ?gures draped in 
black stalking the woods.
While the ?rst episode holds much promise for the 
season to come, certain aspects of the show disappoint.
The show seems to have returned to a slower, more 
relaxed pace than the previous season. The asylum in 
season two is a place with little refuge, but this season, 
there seems to be room for safety within the almost 
inviting witches’ school and the streets of New Orleans. 
The witches go to a fraternity party — admittedly, 
where tragic events unfold — and they prod at each 
other over the kitchen table. The relentlessness of the 
second season is gone, replaced by dark humor, which is 
similarly scattered throughout the ?rst season.
However, there promises to be increasing tension as the 
show progresses. The potential for a bitter season has 
already been set up with the con?icts between Supreme 
Witch Fiona (Jessica Lange) and Cordelia, LaLaurie and 
Laveau, and Madison and the remaining fraternity boys.
While the character relations add unique tensions, the 
premise of the story echoes those that have been done 
before. Harry Potter has already claimed the idea of a 
boarding school for witches and wizards, and Disney 
has touched upon the premise with the Halloweentown 
movie series. There are even references to other 
witchcraft-centric stories in the episode: Fiona likens 
the mansion to Hogwarts, and she threatens to drop a 
house on her daughter à la The Wizard of Oz. One can 
only hope that the show’s creators do not linger upon 
the wonder of the boarding school, but focus instead on 
the tension between the witches, LaLaurie, and Laveau. 
Laveau will hopefully make a breakthrough appearance 
in present-day New Orleans soon.
Most disappointing is Jessica Lange’s character, Fiona. 
Lange’s acting is, of course, stellar: She ?lls the role of a 
witch desperate for youth and full of arrogance. However, 
the character does not seem as strong as expected. In 
fact, she seems weak. She almost begs a man at the 
beginning of the episode to provide her with a youth 
serum, and she gives in to her disappointment by killing 
him when the serum does not work. From that point 
on, she seems to be making up for the youth she does 
not have by berating the young witches at the boarding 
school. Her title as a Supreme Witch implies that she 
has power and personality unlike any other witch, 
but her current portrayal doesn’t live up to that name. 
Hopefully, her character will evolve into the headstrong, 
unrelenting witch that the title implies, rather than one 
who ?ghts with the witches her daughter teaches.
While the ?rst episode may not have the compelling 
pace or unique atmosphere of the second season, this 
third installment in the American Horror Story anthology 
is shaping up to be a free-for-all among a cast of strong 
female characters.

Despite the actress’s impeccable performance, Jessica Lange’s character — Supreme Witch Fiona — is 
disappointingly weak, failing to live up to her formidable title.

music 
pillbox 10.14.137
After the sounds of footsteps upon a wood stage, notes 
escaping from tweaking instruments, and muddled 
conversations among the audience, there is silence, then 
a wave of music. This is the magic of the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra (PSO).
This weekend, the PSO continued its 2013-14 season 
with a string of performances. Hardly a month after its 
return from a European tour, the PSO is already off to 
a strong start, opening with a gala in late September 
featuring Yo-Yo Ma. Although Saturday night’s 
performance did not feature musicians quite as high 
pro?le as Ma, it was nonetheless an enjoyable evening of 
wonderful music.
Once again, conductor Manfred Honeck was at the reins. 
The Austrian-born music director, who has been with 
the orchestra since its 2008-09 season, is very expressive 
and bold in his conducting, and Saturday night’s 
performance was no exception.
The ?rst piece of the night was Samuel Barber’s Adagio 
for Strings. A somber song full of pathos, Adagio 
functions as one organic, drawn-out breath. There is 
a very subtle tension and catharsis throughout the 
piece that the string section captured very well. While 
“Adagio,” as a well known piece, was arguably the main 
attraction of the night, the austere and re?ective piece 
was simply blown out of the water by its successors.
Immediately after Adagio was the dynamic Symphonic 
Suite from Jenufa, as arranged by Honeck and Czech 
composer Tomas Ille. Jenufa is a Czech opera composed 
by Leoš Janácek that tells a twisted tale spun from two 
real-life incidents that occurred in the former state of 
Czechoslovakia in the 1880s.
Set in a remote Czech village, Jenufa is the story of a 
young woman, the titular Jenufa, who is loved by two 
half-brothers but only returns the affections of one of 
them, Steva. In a jealous rage, the other brother, Laca, 
dis?gures Jenufa with a knife, but is immediately 
remorseful. Months later, Steva leaves Jenufa because 
of her dis?gurement, despite the fact that Jenufa has 
just given birth to a child. At this point, Laca still wishes 
to marry Jenufa, but worries that he would also have to 
take care of Steva’s child. Upon hearing this, Jenufa’s 
stepmother lies to Laca and tells him that the baby has 
died, and then later drowns the infant herself.
The music does an excellent job of capturing the drama 
and emotion of the opera; it could tell the story very well 
without any singers, actors, or dancers. A xylophone 
motif weaves in and out between each of the different 
medleys, almost like an alarm bell that wakes you up 
from one dream and into another. The music is highly 
temperamental, moving from a soft, sweet coo to a dark, 
stormy roar. There are moments of ubiquitous unease, 
moments where drums and brass come together in a 
solemn death march, and moments of a sincere and 
profound rebirth, much like the coming of spring after a 
long winter. The arrangement brings out the pure human 
emotion within the opera.
Mozart’s Concerto No. 21 in C major for Piano and 
Orchestra, the next piece of the night, featured 
Yulianna Avdeeva as the piano soloist. Avdeeva, who 
won ?rst place in the International Fryderyk Chopin 
Piano Competition in 2010, is known for her formidable 
technique and intense intellectual rigor. Concerto No. 
21 may not be the immediate thing that springs to 
mind when one thinks of “intense intellectual rigor,” but 
nonetheless Avdeeva did a wonderful job capturing the 
tone of the piece, giving an elegant performance. As is 
typical of Mozart, the piece combines the stateliness 
and politesse of baroque music, a hint of the budding 
Romanticism, and Mozart’s own ingenious, playful ?air.
The ?rst movement of Concert No. 21 brings to mind 
images of an evening ball, with guests dancing and 
gossiping, prominently featuring the enchanting chime 
of the piano. It then moves on to its famous Adante 
movement, a romantic and sensual kind of music that 
is easy to become lost in before the ?nal movement, an 
energetic Rondo.
The ?nal piece of the night, Antonín Dvorák’s Symphony 
No. 8 in G major was a strong ?nish to the night. Dvorák, 
another Czech composer, was a great lover of the 
countryside, a ?erce passion that greatly carries over to 
his music. Symphony No.  8 feels like a breath of fresh 
air on a bright summer day as you travel down a country 
road, gazing at the wide open plains in the distance. 
Plenty of recurring motifs and melodies swirl around in 
the wind, but the piece is at its best when at its most 
forceful and bombastic. The ending — the last few notes 
of the night — was strong, vibrant, and de?ant.
Though arrangement-wise, the combination of the 
slow, solemn Adagio felt at odds with the other more 
vibrant, forceful pieces, the PSO delivered the kind of 
wonderful performance that has come to be expected of 
the orchestra.

A CaPittsburgh showcases campus talent
Annual charity concert features all six Carnegie Mellon groups and one guest ensemble
Coed a cappella group The Treblemakers gave a 
vibrant set featuring gifted soloists.
                  Jason Chen | Staff Photographer
Counterpoint, Carnegie Mellon’s all-female a cappella 
group, hosted its annual A CaPittsburgh event in Rangos 
Hall last Saturday night, showcasing the talents of all the 
different a cappella groups on campus. This year’s theme 
was “Music is everyone’s possession,” and the proceeds 
from the event went to Landfill Harmonic, a group that 
salvages garbage and reworks it into musical instruments 
for worldwide distribution.
The event was a great opportunity to see the diversity 
and excellence of the a cappella community and witness 
part of the musicians’ world. It was incredibly engaging 
because the members of each group appeared to be hav-
ing fun, looking tight-knit and as they bounced to the 
beat of the songs. 
Counterpoint opened and closed the night, setting a 
precedent for the lighthearted feel of the evening and 
each group’s excitement to perform. They were incredi-
bly energetic from the very beginning, with their mashup 
“Stereo Hearts of Fame,” to the very end with a spirited 
version of “Wannabe” by the Spice Girls. They also per-
formed “Home” with two soulful and hilarious soloists 
— senior communication design and human-computer 
interaction double major Maggie Bignell and first-year 
mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering 
double major Leo Zubillaga — and a beautiful rendi-
tion of “Trouble Is a Friend” by sophomore voice major 
Samantha Kronenfeld.
After Counterpoint’s opening number, the Treblemakers 
took the stage with inflatable instruments, immediately 
indicative of the character of the group. This spirit was 
certainly showcased in their first song, “Love Shack.” 
The rendition featured beautiful harmonies by first-year 
undeclared CIT student Sage Yort and first-year unde-
clared MCS student Kate Borst and a strong, entertaining 
performance by junior materials science and engineer-
ing major Jonathan Touchette. The group continued 
with a lovely version of The Hush Sound’s “Tidal Wave” 
and ended strong with a clear, beautiful performance of 
Adele’s “Skyfall.” Soloist and junior vocal performance 
major Bridget McCoy was incredible, and the arrange-
ment of the backup vocals fit together perfectly.
Deewane, Carnegie Mellon’s all-male South Asian a cap-
pella group, brought some international flavor with songs 
that fused Eastern and Western music very successfully. 
Their performances were light and gentle on the whole, 
with the exception of their last song, “Treasure,” which 
featured a lot of body and personality from soloists Haris 
Usmani, a master’s student in music, and senior psychol-
ogy major Shawn Gupta.
Christian a cappella group Joyful Noise performed their 
first two songs, Imagine Dragon’s “Demons” and Poison’s 
“Something to Believe In,” in a clear and sweet manner. 
With their last song, they continued Deewane’s interna-
tional theme with “Baba Yutu,” the Swahili translation of 
the Lord’s Prayer. This group truly performed as a unit, 
and its members seemed have a lot of confidence in each 
other.
The Soundbytes were a unit in a different way — like 
one organism breathing, moving, and singing as one. 
Their arrangements were layered to perfection, allowing 
solos to break out when advantageous and folding them 
into the other vocals at other times. Their performance 
featured a good set list arranged in unique, well-thought-
out ways. They began with a bashful but deeply beautiful 
performance of “Used to Love You” by first-year archi-
tecture major Quinton Laurencio and continued with the 
heart-wrenchingly clear voice of soloist and senior com-
puter science major Tyler Hedrick. Their set ended with 
the high-energy performance of “Candy Man” with three 
vocalists — undeclared CIT first-year Alexis De La Rosa, 
junior Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts student 
Divya Mouli, and junior psychology major Jaclyn Ross — 
blended to perfection, with Ross offering mind-boggling 
notes à la Christina Aguilera.
All-male group The Originals was another ensemble that 
worked as one. The background vocals took a front seat 
in their performances, being intricate, interesting, and 
incredibly attuned to each other. This musicality was 
accented by their uniform movement as they sang. Their 
soloists were incredibly talented, and sophomore vocal 
performance major Albert Stanley gave a strong perfor-
mance with a lot of personality that had the audience 
laughing. Their “I Wish/Wild Wild West” mashup was 
arranged especially skillfully.
Also featured on the program was the University of 
Pittsburgh’s PalPITTations, a guest group of Pitt graduate 
students. This group was more closed off to the audi-
ence, but the soloists opened up in very emotional ways. 
Most notably, during the group’s performance of “Creep,” 
soloist Lindsay Johnson sang with a lot of feeling, and 
every note was punctuated by strong body language.
Throughout the night, the groups had the audience 
dancing in their seats, clapping along, and even crying 
at times. As each group brought its own flavor to the 
stage, audience members were able to see the common 
musicality and excitement of the night shine through, 
although each group took a different approach. The eve-
ning was an entertaining and enjoyable event that show-
cased remarkable talent while giving back to the musical 
community.

dance
pillbox 10.14.139
Maryyann Landlord | Junior PhotographerPartners Eric Lee and Tiffany Tse dance the cha-cha.
Inspired by the hit reality TV show Dancing with the 
Stars, “stars” from Greek life and various clubs on cam-
pus took to the ballroom dance floor with members of 
the Ballroom Dance Club. These competed for the mirror 
ball trophy and money for their philanthropies in the first 
annual Dancing with the Stars: CMU Edition, hosted by 
junior voice major Taylor Rawley. Junior business admin-
istration and statistics double major Nancy Yue, the 
Ballroom Dance Club events coordinator, organized the 
competition.
The stars were paired up with their partners just two 
weeks ago, making for a quick, hectic turnaround from 
complete strangers to performing couples. On Saturday 
night, Rangos Hall was full of friends and fans eager to 
see these stars show off their newfound dancing skills. 
The event began with a quick video montage of each 
couple introducing themselves and their dance before the 
first couples took the stage.
Dancers wowed the audience with fierce tangos, quick 
jives, romantic waltzes, and saucy sambos, dancing to 
impress with tricky lifts, captivating spins, and lightning-
quick footwork.
On the other side of the competition, the judges were 
an entertaining and dynamic panel. The panel was com-
posed of former professional ballroom dance competi-
tor and teacher Christine Zona, former ballroom dancer 
Geoffrey Morgan, junior civil and environmental engi-
neering major Michelle Couste, and computer science 
professor David Kosbie.
Though surprisingly insightful about the dances, the 
judges were also full of bad jokes, charm, and sincere 
compliments that kept the mood light throughout the 
evening. Following each dance, they gave their feed-
back — holistic if often humorous commentaries on lines, 
posture, energy, storytelling, and footwork. The audience 
was impressed by each dance and showed enthusiasm 
with loud cheering, but the judges went deeper.
Opening the show, junior computer science major Eric 
Lee and sophomore decision science major Tiffany Tse 
displayed strong technique with their cha-cha, but the 
dancers were critiqued for hesitating in their movements 
and for energy that “wasn’t entirely there.” Junior deci-
sion science major Hannah Wirt and first-year computer 
science major Marcus Todd amped up the energy with 
an impressive swing number that got both the crowd and 
the judges excited, though both Morgan and Zona made 
comments on the lack of real swing dancing in the piece. 
Junior mechanical engineering major Katie Sharkey and 
junior biology major Yimeng Xu changed the mood with 
an elegant Viennese waltz of romantic and simple grace, 
before senior English major Hannah Polack and senior 
electrical and computer engineering major Victor Wang 
switched things up again with a samba that was provoc-
ative and exciting, although the judges noted it lacked 
some technique.
In many cases, judges commented on the relationship 
between the dancers on stage, with either praise for 
seeming genuine or criticism for feeling forced and awk-
ward. More than simply whether feet were pointed or 
not, the judges also discussed artistic elements such as 
the dancers’ ability to communicate a story and interpret 
the movements in a personal way.
Although light hearted, the judges’ feedback treated the 
dancers as if they were professionals. Keeping in mind 
that the dancers had just learned the dances within the 
couple of weeks, Kosbie commented, “I wish I could see 
this dance in a few weeks, but I think I’m going to be 
saying that a lot.”
As the evening progressed, the number of quirky tan-
gents increased, with references to bad Pittsburgh 
drivers, the speed of burning salsa, and two of whether 
Carnegie Mellon can cure dementia purely through ball-
room dancing.
Toward the end of the event, Zona made sure to compli-
ment the entire group: “I think that in the two weeks 
everybody did a wonderful job — students and the 
Ballroom Dance Club that put together the routines.”
The winner was determined in part by a panel of judges 
and in part by the fans, who helped their favorite dancers 
win by liking photos on the Facebook page, buying tick-
ets in dancers names and voting with their phones right 
after the show.
After all the dancers had performed, Rawley invited the 
audience to vote for their favorite dancers within the next 
five minutes online, and people quickly whipped out their 
smartphones to participate. 
The grand prize went to junior communication design 
major Sam Ahmed — representing Delta Tau Delta — 
and his partner, senior psychology major Helen Chao, for 
their fast, furious, and seamlessly timed jive.
After the excitement of the results died down, the 
Ballroom Dance Club finished off the night with one last 
dance. In addition to presenting a stress-relieving, fun 
event, the night also raised over $800, half of which will 
be going to Delta Tau Delta’s philanthropy, the Children’s 
Institute. Certainly a tradition to continue in the future, 
Dancing with the Starts: CMU Edition was able to com-
bine dance, service, community, and humor into an 
engaging evening.

pillbox 10.14.13
Fantasy and reality collided once again on Thursday 
with the premiere of Once Upon a Time in Wonderland 
on ABC. The show is a spinoff of Once Upon a Time, now 
in its third season.
The show takes place within the Once Upon a Time 
universe, but follows Alice (Sophie Lowe) of Lewis 
Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland as she searches for her lost 
love Cyrus (Peter Gadiot) in Wonderland, with the help 
of the White Rabbit (voiced by John Lithgow) and the 
Knave of Hearts (Michael Socha).
As in Once Upon a Time, familiar aspects of the story are 
contrasted by deviations from the Lewis Carroll classic, 
especially in character. In this ?rst episode, Alice knows 
full well that the mushroom will change her size, and 
uses it accordingly to ?ee from the Queen’s soldiers by 
shrinking herself and hiding in the bottle lying beside 
the pathway. Alice discovers that her convenient hiding 
spot is actually a genie bottle inhabited by Cyrus, 
who is willing to open his bottle to her, even after she 
threatens to eat the other mushroom half and shatter 
the bottle with her sudden growth spurt. Instead of the 
meek, curious little girl we all know, this Alice is a strong 
character who is not afraid to face danger to get what 
she wants.
Alice and Cyrus become fast friends, and eventually fall 
in love, but in the exact moment that everything seems 
to fall into place for the lovers, the Red Queen (Emma 
Rigby) shows up. During the ?ght that ensues, Cyrus is 
pushed off a ledge into the boiling sea that lies below.
Flashbacks to Alice’s time in Wonderland are intercut 
with inquiries into her mental health, taking place at 
Bedlam Hospital in Victorian England. Wonderland is 
?lled with vibrant colors and familiar scenes, such as 
Alice stealing a bit of magical mushroom and ?eeing 
from the Queen of Hearts who screams “Off with her 
head!” Meanwhile, the colors of Bedlam are muted and 
dark; gloom pervades the place.
Alice escapes from Bedlam and goes back to Wonderland 
under the impression that Cyrus is alive. It is revealed to 
the viewer that the Rabbit has lured her back by order 
of the Queen, who’s working with Aladdin villain Jafar 
(Naveen Andrews). He’s after the wishes that Cyrus gave 
Alice, but the Queen’s motives remain secret for now.
Meanwhile, the Knave is reluctant to stay in Wonderland, 
unwilling to risk being discovered and punished for the 
things he did after Alice left. Although their initial search 
for Cyrus fails, Alice ?nds Cyrus’s amulet, a token that 
glows when she is near, and gains renewed hope that he 
is alive. She convinces the Knave to stay by promising to 
pay him in wishes.
In the ?nal scenes, a ?ashback to Cyrus’s supposed 
death reveals that he was caught by Jafar on a ?ying 
carpet and is the Queen’s captive, imprisoned in a cage.
The ?rst episode bene?ts from the set-up established by 
Once Upon a Time and the familiar story of Alice, so the 
show can jump right into the narrative. The weaknesses 
of the show will come not from the story, but from the 
production details. Since the show will presumably be 
set in Wonderland most of the time, viewers may get 
distracted by the low-quality graphics that make up 
the background and characters like the Rabbit or the 
Cheshire Cat.
Although Alice and Cyrus are the star-crossed lovers 
here, it is the chemistry between Alice and the Knave 
that compels viewers most. It becomes obvious that the 
Knave really cares about Alice — in a platonic way — 
and is staying not just for the payment, but also to make 
sure she stays safe.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland airs Thursdays at 
8 p.m. on ABC.
