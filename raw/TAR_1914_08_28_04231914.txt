The regular weekly meeting of the 
Assembly of the School of Applied 
Industries, on Wednesday, April 15th, 
proved to be a great event in the his­
tory of the school. After the usual 
routine business, President J. R. Price 
called upon Dean Connelley, who 
spoke on the importance of Physical 
Training, and called attention particu­
larly to the Industries Track Meet of 
April 18th. Next Coach Steffens was 
introduced and he made a decided hit 
with the fellows, by the enthusiastic 
manner in which he handled the foot­
ball situation. He was followed by Mr. 
McCulloch, who emphasized baseball 
as an example of manly sport for col- 
legemen. R. J. McDowell led the sing­
ing and there was spirit galore. Coach 
Steffens spoke as follows:
“Mr. Chairman and men of the In­
dustries School of Carnegie Tech, I 
am very happy to be here this after­
noon and I am glad that the men I 
have met in the short time I have been 
here, are the sort of fellows for which 
we are looking.
Now today, men, I .want to talk to 
two classes of men; first, I have been 
told on numerous occasions that there 
are certain men around the school 
here who do not come out for football, 
men who have ability and men who 
ought to be out there trying to help 
make a good team. Now, they tell 
me that they give all sorts of "excuses 
that I have heard for a number of 
years, the stock and trade excuses that 
they don’t have time. Now, there 
isn’t anything in that proposition. The 
men who conduct this institution never 
intended that any man coming to 
school here should not have two hours 
a day for recreation or at least one 
hour. And, that is all that we ask. 
Two hours if you can give it, but an 
hour is enough. So, excuses of this 
kind don’t have any weight with me. 
Take men from the selfish point of 
view and there isn’t a man in such 
good condition that he does not need 
exercise, and what is better than to 
get out in the air, get out there and 
run around that field, getting whole­
some exercise and developing your­
self.
This is a young institution, men. 
You are not trailing on tradition and 
custom. You men are building what 
will be in the future tradition. That 
is going to be the sort of tradition

A poor exhibition of baseball gave 
the opening game for the Varsity to 
Pitt on last Saturday, April 18. In­
ability to hit, criminal base-running, 
and weak fielding all contributed to a 
defeat by ten runs to one, although 
Pitt did not put up a sensational game 
at any time.
The contest was staged on Tech 
Field, although under the Pitt manage­
ment, the original plans of using 
Forbes Field having fallen through. 
A large crowd occupied the stand and 
the rooting was strongly partisan. A 
mid-season touch was given by a num­
ber of the male fans who found the 
sun and the excitement more bearable 
in shirt sleeves and doffed their coats.
Four pitchers were used by Pitt and 
all of them were wild, but had enough 
control to keep the Plaid batters hit- 
less during seven innings. Hines 
started the pitching for Tech, but poor 
support, more than ineffective hurling, 
caused eight runs to be tallied in the 
three innings in which he worked. He 
was reached for six hits, struck out 
four men and hit one, but did not issue 
a pass. Ryan replaced him and did 
good work. He was reached for six 
hits in five innings, one being a home 
run by Pitt’s heaviest hitter, Ammon. 
He struck out five men and issued one 
walk.
Greenbaum walked Kreider, the first 
man up, but Kirk struck out. Brine 
was thrown out by Greenbaum at first, 
the play allowing Kreider to reach 
second, where he was left when Lain 
swung three times without connect­
ing.
Healy hit to Auerswald who .foozled 
the ball, Wilson was safe at first and 
Healy at second when DeMuth 
dropped Brine’s throw. Dillon was 
thrown out by Hines, but DeMuth 
overthrew at home to catch Healy and 
the two Pitt men scored. Peck hit 
safely to middle and scored on Am­
mon’s long drive to the hill for three 
bases. Beatty and Gaw fell victims to 
Hines’ curves. Three runs, two hits.
In the second, DeMuth walked and 
went to second on Humphries’ sacri­
ficial bunt, Greenbaum to Peck. Auer­
swald fanned, DeMuth stealing third. 
McDonald drew a pass and purloined 
second, while Greenbaum was giving 
four wide ones to Hines. With the 
bases full, McDonald went to sleep 
off second and was thrown out by 
Beatty, ending the scoring chances.
Schenck hit through short and 
scored when Greenbaum drove the ball 
into the wire fences for three bags.
Heally flied to Kirk and Greenbaum 
scored on the throw-in. Wilson hit 
to Humphries, who threw him out at 
first. Hines fielded Dillon’s hit in 
time to get the ball to DeMuth before 
the runner reached the station. Two 
runs, two hits.
With Langdon pitching in the third, 
Kreider and Kirk fanned. Brine hit 
an easy one to Gaw and was out at 
first.
Auerswald threw Peck out at first. 
Ammon was hit by Hines and took 
first, scoring on Beatty’s long two- 
bagger to middle. Gaw singled and 
was safe at second on the throw to the 
plate which failed to stop Beatty 
from1 scoring. Gaw stole third while 
Schenck was fanning and tallied on a 
wild pitch. Langdon also fanned. 
Three runs, two hits.
In the fourth, Lain, DeMuth and 
Humphries struck out. Healy hit to 
left for two bases. Wilson followed 
with a single to short, and both men 
advanced a base on Dillon’s long fly 
to Kreider, who made a sensational 
running catch. Healy tried to score, 
but was thrown out, Hines to Lain. 
Peck flied to Brine. No runs, two hits. 
Ryan pitching.
Auerswald reached first when Lang­
don dropped a fly ball, and then the 
Tech man took advantage of the con­
fusion to advance to second. Gaw 
should have had him, but failed to 
tag him out. Stannard, having replaced 
McDonald, struck out. Ryan hit a 
grounder to Langdon and was out at 
first, while Auerswald reached third. 
Kreider flied out to Wilson.
Ammon hit the first ball back of the 
scoreboard and went around the cir­
cuit. Beatty and Gaw both were 
fanned, then Schenck drew a walk. 
Morrow, batting for Langdon, was 
safe at first when Brine threw to sec­
ond in an unsuccessful attempt to catch 
Schenck. Healy was thrown out at 
first by Ryan. One run, one hit.
With Greer pitching in the sixth, 
Kirk, Brine and Lain died without 
reaching first. Wilson, Dillon and 
Peck were also retired in order.
In the seventh, DeMuth walked, as 
did Humphries. Auerswald hit to 
Healy, who retired Humphries at sec­
ond. Auerswald tried to steal second 
but overslid the bag and was put out, 
Greer to Gaw. Stannard went out, 
Gaw to Giles.
Englehart, replacing Ammon, struck 
out. Beatty singled to right and stole 
second while Gaw was fanning.

LOWER (IASS WINS 
INDUSTRIES MEET
DEFEATS UPPER CLASSMEN BY 
DECISIVE SCORE.
Favored with a clear sky and sum­
mer weather, the first annual inter­
class Industry School track meet, 
which was held last Saturday morning 
proved unusually successful. A great 
deal of credit is due second-assistant 
track manager E. W. Overdorff, who 
had charge of the meet. Every detail 
was carefully arranged and even pro­
grams were supplied. The latter were 
especially noticeable for they were the 
work of the school’s own presses.
The events were interesting and 
close, but the times and distances re­
corded were, with one or two excep­
tions, not good. The lower class 
clearly demonstrated its supremacy, 
scoring 67 points to 36 for the upper, 
34 for the middle, and 7 for the teach­
er’s class. C. E. Hemmann, with a total 
of 16, was the individual point winner. 
He was closely followed by his class­
mate, Adams, who registered 14 points 
and Hulet of the middle class, who 
gained 12 counts. Hemmann also 
gave the best individual performance 
when he ran the 220 yard dash in
22 4-5 seconds. In this race, Kuh- 
man of the lower class, hitherto un­
known, ran a splendid race, finishing 
second. Vernon, a husky plebe,
showed Varsity ability by putting the 
shot more than 33 feet. Vv^ith a little
coaching, he should develop into a
dependable weight man. Ex-Cap­
tain Criswell of the basket ball team, 
a Varsity track man of two years ago, 
displayed a flash of his old time form 
when he easily cleared the bar at five 
feet, four inches. He wras not pressed 
and therefore did not continue jump­
ing. E. F. Cary, of the lower class, 
furnished a surprise in the half mile, 
forcing Finley to sprint at the finish. 
Finley was running smoothly and well 
within his usual pace until the last 
stretch. Then he was compelled to 
go at full speed to prevent Cary from 
overtaking him. Dunseith ran the 
first lap of the quarter mile in good 
form' but took it easy after he had the 
race cinched. Most of the entrants in 
the broad jump had difficulty in get­
ting their “take off.” Hulet fouled 
twice and then had to be content with 
17 feet 7 inches. Both of his other 
jumps were at least a foot better but 
unfortunately they were not counted. 
The two lap relay race was a nerve 
racking affair. Dunseith of the Mid­
dle Class started on the final half lap

THE POLICY OF COLLEGE 
PAPERS.
Recently, at the University of Wis­
consin, where is published one of the 
best college dailies in the country, a 
change in the editorial board brought 
out certain statements as to their poli­
cies which we wish to place before our 
students.
The resigning editor, in his last edi­
torial, wrote: “At the beginning of
the school year the editorial policy 
was definitely laid down, a policy con­
scientiously framed with the best in­
terests of the student body in view. 
That policy has been adhered to strict­
ly. The things this column has stood 
for have been fought for, regardless 
of the price. Some friendships have 
been sacrificed, I trust they are not 
many; many valuable ones have been 
formed. There have been denounce­
ments, and the editor has not always 
been esteemed or kindly regarded, but 
it is hoped that anything unpleasant 
may be forgotten, and that all person­
al differences may be lost in a common 
regard for things more worth while.
His successor took up the duties of 
the office, saying, “There are those 
who would have this column devoted 
entirely to the harmless but in nowise 
profitable task of patting on the back 
victorious athletic or debating teams. 
They might approve even an occasion­
al flight into the realm1 of moral ab­
stractions. But as soon as a concrete 
problem is attacked, they say, ‘Let it 
alone.’ This phase epitomizes the 
spirit of those who at all times and 
in all places stand in the way of prog­
ress. That spirit actuated most of 
the opoosition; at the risk of offending 
students of this type, this column will
continue to be devoted largely to at­
tacking conditions in our University 
life that are in need of change. No 
mere muck-raking will be done; noth­
ing will be criticized unless there is 
constructive suggestion to accompany 
it.”
It will be evident that the above 
quotations have a most distinct bear­
ing on conditions existing at this in­
stitution, and, so we suppose, at most 
other American colleges and universi­
ties.
We, too, this year announced our 
strict policy at the commencement, a 
policy which we have always endea­
vored to follow. Whenever we have 
seen conditions which should be reme­
died, we have never hesitated to recom­
mend their improvement. We, also, 
have been told over and over again to 
let certain concrete problems alone; 
we have been told that our policy was 
“rotten,” that it was decidedly harm­
ful to the best interests of the students 
and the school, that we were destroy­
ing school spirit without doing any­
thing in the line of constructive work. 
Yet we have continued on our way, 
trying honestly ancl sqUarely to do 
our duty, as we were able to see it. 
We have always believed that honest 
criticism is never harmful—in fact we, 
ourselves, have always been glad to re­
ceive it; we have held that only 
through publicity can a remedy for 
certain invidious practices be hoped 
for.
It is quite possible that we have not 
been able to accomplish much; but 
we hope that our labors have not been 
entirely fruitless. In whatever at­
tempts we have made, we hope that 
the entire student body of Carnegie 
have always given us their confidence, 
and have known that we were actuated 
by unselfish motives. If we have at­
tained that trust, that belief in our 
sincere aims then we may feel that 
the last year has not been wasted. 
Rather, we can hope that it has been 
but a stepping stone in the progress 
toward greater things for both The 
Tartan and The Carnegie Institute of 
Technology.
KEEPING POSTED.
We have often wondered whether 
the students in an institution such as 
ours keep posted on the affairs of the 
world. We have sometimes felt that 
the tendency of a technical course, 
with its requirements of long hours in 
school and still longer hours outside, 
is to a certain degree narrowing. Of 
necessity, perhaps, such is the case; 
but if so, the situation is certainly not 
one for self-congratulation.
Without doubt, the average student 
here is very busy with his school work; 
yet at the same time he should be 
careful not to lose touch with the 
world. He ought to spend a small 
amount of time, even if only a few 
moments each day, in reading the good 
magazines which are so readily acces­
sible in the Library, or in perusing 
the reliable newspapers of the coun­
try. By consistent reading, a man may 
in this manner attain a valuable knowl­
edge of the current events of the 
world, and when he goes out into the 
world himself, he will not be merely
a “half-baked” college man with smat­
tering of a few technical subjects and 
no realization of their application to 
the every-day life of our country, but 
rather will be a well-posted man, whom 
the world will have to notice and 
reckon with sooner or later.
NOVELTY IN DECORATIVE 
PANELS.
In the Assembly Hall of the Wash­
ington Irving High School have been 
exhibited seven panels, designed and 
painted by James Monroe Hewlett, 
Charles Basing and Arthur T. Hew­
lett. They are for the decoration of 
the auditorium of the School of Ap­
plied Design, Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, Pittsburgh.
The idea of these decorations is 
novel. The instruction in applied de­
sign, that is to say in ornament ap­
plied to a building or any other object 
that has to be decorated, is based upon 
the historic styles. The student is 
required to be familiar with decorative 
designs of Egypt, Assyria, Greece, 
Rome, Byzantium, the Middle Ages 
and the Renaissance. It is hoped that 
by this time he will have learned the 
various applications of the few prin­
ciples that underly all good ornament, 
and be qualified, if he has any inven­
tion of his own, to execute designs as 
suitable to modern feeling as the old 
designs were to their several periods. 
If he has no invention, that is to say, 
if he has no real qualifications for 
being a decorator, it is at least hoped 
that he will imitate intelligently.
Accordingly, in this series of decora­
tions, the character of the decorative 
art of each of the countries and periods 
enumerated above is made the subject 
of one of these panels. The designers 
have assembled in each instance frag­
ments of the architecture, sculpture 
and ornament of the period—a bit of 
this and a bit of that, pieced together, 
as it were, into a mosaic, that in its 
whole gives a suggestion of the char­
acter and feeling of the period’s deco­
ration.
This is where the novelty of the 
scheme appears, and the very difficult 
problem has been carried out with un­
derstanding and skill. For while these 
several panels present nothing that 
the student can directly reproduce—it 
was not intended that they should— 
they will convey to him, if he is recep­
tive, the spirit of the period.—The New 
York American.
An attractive and unusual opening 
is offered to members of the senior 
class and to recent graduates of Har­
vard in the form of one year teaching 
positions in the Orient. This plan 
has already met with the favor of 
many, and several have availed them­
selves of the chance to visit Japan, 
China, and the Philippines. These 
positions are' in the various educa­
tional institutions of the American 
missions.—The Harvard Crimson.
The Harvard Crimson gives statis­
tics stating that 44 students were 
dropped as a result of the mid-year 
examinations in the college. No sen­
iors were dropped; eight juniors, six­
teen sophomores, thirteen freshmen, 
and seven irregulars had to leave.

GETTING A RATING.
The graduate of technical school if 
he is at liberty to plan and choose 
his course, generally accepts his first 
position favoring the opportunity of 
gaining experience in preference to 
the salary. As soon as he has located, 
the first day finds him in a new be­
ginning, among the many. He rea­
lizes that most of them have the same 
aspirations as he, that a few had the 
same aspirations a long while ago, and 
that the fixations make him uneasy. 
Details then repeat themselves, and 
in a day he makes up his mind that 
he should be gleaning more than sixty 
dollars a month with the experience 
thrown in. The salary occupies his 
mind; a better rating is desired at 
this stage of the game; and little does 
he realize that an eastern college pres­
ident has gathered data and made ob­
servations convincing that the average 
graduate earns little more than forty- 
five dollars a month.
If the graduate has now had about 
a years experience, he may not have 
known that he had just arrived, be­
cause with one year of experience and 
a college education, he is eligible to 
take a Civil Service examination. 
These examinations are posted about 
every six months by the Civil Service 
Commission, Washington, D. C. 
Should he pass one of these examina­
tions and find himself among the chos­
en, he is immediately rated at eighty- 
five to one twenty-five dollars a 
month.
The different positions offered 
through the Civil Service bureau, cov­
er every profession. Personal contact 
with one of the departments will al­
low some idea of the work and ex­
perience available.
The U. S. Bureau of Mines under 
the Department of the Interior, now 
about 10 years old, is one of the new 
departments that outcropped from the 
U. S. Geological Survey. Five years 
or so, several men comprised the 
Pittsburgh staff with laboratories in 
the Carnegie Technical Schools. In 
the short interval, the Pittsburgh 
plant, now located at the Arsenal 
grounds, has grown to about ISO em­
ployes engaged in research work. Car­
negie Tech has several representa­
tives, Pennsylvania State College 
probably has the most; and there are 
men from most of the colleges in the 
States. Some 250 men comprise an­
other portion of this bureau in Wash­
ington, D. C. About 15 per cent of 
the employees are scattered over the 
country, Alaska and outlying posses­
sions included, engaged in co-operat­
ive research and investigation.
These research and investigation 
problems are extensive, and the exper­
ience that one gains is probably more 
general than is offered in the commer­
cial plant. The mechanical, the elec­
trical, the metallurgical, and the chem­
ical engineer is brought in touch with 
each other, some of the investigations 
requiring an assembling of ideas that
could probably not be collected as 
conveniently elsewhere.
1 he mine investigation work has 
probably been brought more to the 
attention of the casual observer than 
the other work of the Bureau; how­
ever of interesting importance are the 
problems that deal with the conser­
vation of natural resources. Much ex­
perience may be gained from the ex­
perimental work with power plants; 
lagging type of gas producer; explos­
ives, gaseous and solids; furnace and 
cupola problems; transmission and 
utilization of heat; coke manufacture 
and recovery of by-products; fuel 
briquettes; coal, gas, and oil problems 
in combustion; utilization of the 
wastes in the industries; and metal 
mining recovery problems.
The experimental work that has 
been done at the U. S. Bureau of 
Mines is published in detail in bulle­
tin form and may be obtained upon 
application to the Director of the U. S. 
Bureau of Mines.—Alumni Bulletin.

It is the experience of the princi­
pals of the Pennsylvania Railroad, 
that technical graduates are deficient 
in three general particulars:
1. Lack of practical experience and 
judgment.
2. An idea they are far superior to 
the rest of mankind.
3. A certain narrowness of mind, 
inculcated through a too exclusive at­
tention in college to mathematics and 
theoretical science,

TARTAN RIBBON TO BE PRE­
SENTED TO MARGARET 
CARNEGIE.
The students of the Weaving De­
partment of the M. M. C. S. School, 
are weaving a silk ribbon, of Tartan 
plaid, which will be presented to Mar­
garet Carnegie on Founder’s Day, 
April 30.
The ribbon will be nine inches wide 
and about two and one half yards 
long. The design was taken from the 
piece of silk that was sent from Scot­
land to line the hood of Dr. McCon- 
way’s gown. The principle colors of 
the ribbon are blue and green, with 
stripes of red and yellow.
PLAY AT WASHINGTON.
Saturday’s Game With W. & J.
Xext Saturday, the baseball team 
will perform at Washington, Pa., 
Washington & Jefferson being the op­
ponents. The team has been consid­
erably shaken up this week and the 
new combinations should work to bet­
ter advantage than in last week’s 
game. The work of the past few days 
has been devoted to improving the 
stick-work, and it is certain that a few 
more bingles will result.
The last few innings of the Pitt 
game showed that the team can play 
well together, and every player real­
izes that more “pep” will have to be 
opened up, so the story of last week 
is not likely to be repeated. .
A large squad of players will be 
taken on the trip, and it is expected 
that a considerable number of rooters 
will accompany the team'. The trip 
is not long and the fare not a heavy 
tax on the pocket-book, so more fel­
lows can make the journey than have 
spoken about it so far. See Manager 
Routh about arrangements and make 
your plans to help the team take the 
Red and Black scalp to atone for the 
first defeat.
BASKETBALL LETTERS

sociation Executive Committee last

eighth, Tech got its only hit and its 
only run. Ryan flied out to Wilson, 
who made a difficult catch. Kreider 
swung wildly thrice and retired. Kirk 
drew a base on balls and took second 
on a poor throw by the pitcher. Brine 
cracked out a long single to right cen­
ter, Kirk scoring. Lain popped up a 
fly to Pheiffer. One run, one hit.
Healy hit to Humphries, who fielded 
cleanly and threw to DeMuth in plen­
ty of time. Wilson sent a long one 
to left middle, which Kreider caught 
on the run. Pheiffer singled through 
short, but was left when Auerswald 
threw Giles out at first. No runs, one 
hit.
DeMuth’s foul fly was caught by 
Schenck in the ninth. Humphries 
walked and stole second. Auerswald 
flied out to Pheiffer, and Crum, batting

ANNUAL SPRING INTER­
SCHOOL MEET SCIENCE 
RULES FAVORITE FOR 
SATURDAY’S CLASH.
Once again, the men’s schools will 
meet on the track Saturday afternoon, 
to settle for another year the inter­
school championship.
And once again a Science victory 
seems assured. Last year the Science 
gained the first hold on the new 
trophy presented by the Carnegie Pub­
licity Bureau. The result of the 1914 
meet will in all probability serve to 
strengthen the engineer’s right to the 
permanent possession of the bronze 
placard.
Judging from1 last week’s Industry 
meet, that school should carry off the 
majority of points in the dashes and 
shot put. The Design School, or 
rather Haselton, will win the mile and 
two-mile runs and perhaps the half 
mile, if he enters the last named race. 
The other events, we concede to the 
Science School, the hurdles, the 
jumps, the pole vault, the hammer and 
discus throws seem certain to be won 
by the latter’s men. This pre-digested 
resume is based largely on first place 
points. As usual, second and third 
places will count, and therein lie the

incentive to competition. In every 
meet, the individual winners may usu­
ally be reached before hand, but the 
“dark horses” have often decided vic­
tory or defeat. So that while another 
Science victory seems evident, the 
closest score in the history of the 
schools seems inevitable.
The meet will start promptly at 2 
o’clock. Entry blanks will be posted 
on the bulletin boards of the three 
schools and all those wishing to com­
pete must signify their intention not 
later than Thursday, for they will not 
be permitted to enter an event at the 
last minute. Silver and bronze but­
tons will be awarded for first and sec­
ond places respectively. Button, but­
ton! Come out and win a button!

, Coach Steffens Address
Continued from Page 1 
with ninety per cent of us. We want 
to have you men come out and try to 
make that team and we don’t want to 
hear such excuses as “I haven’t got 
time” or “My mamma don’t want me 
to play football.” With such excuses 
we are not going to get anywhere. 
I am here to try to create some spirit 
among you men in the game of foot­
ball. There are men who haven’t come 
out yet that can be of great use to 
us and I hope that they will see fit 
to come out and give us a chance to 
develop them into good football play­
ers. There will be a few more weeks 
practice and if you don’t have a chance 
to make the team, come out anyway. 
If you cannot make the team, maybe 
we can do some good for you, 
straighten out your shoulders or your 
chest. But there are men here that 
aren’t out in that field because they 
haven’t the spirit they ought to have. 
Now, I don’t mean to criticise. I 
am here simply to arouse the spirit 
that ought to be in men of real red 
blood.
Now, there is another phase of this 
situation. The candidates for next 
year’s team are not limited to the men 
who are here now. We hope that 
there will be in this school next fall 
new candidates under the students. 
Now, men, along this line I think it 
is the duty of every man here to look 
about his home community and find 
out men who are going to go to school. 
There isn’t a man In this school who 
doesn’t know of some man who is 
going to enter college next fall. A 
lot of you know of men who have foot­
ball ability, men who are looking for 
a technical training. We haven’t 
any unusual inducements here at 
Tech. We can’t give men schol­
arship's. We can’t give men fat 
jobs with big salaries and little 
work but we can get good men in 
the decent and legitimate way. You 
know you can all be proud of your 
institution. No man can get a better 
training than he can here if he is look­
ing for a technical training. Encour­
age them1 to come to Tech and, fur­
ther, if there be any man here or about 
the college that knows of men who 
have football ability who are thinking 
of entering Tech or some other school 
of a similar kind, I wish you would 
let us have the names.
We haven’t anything to offer these 
men except a mighty good training and 
a decent place to go to school, and, a 
lot of decent fellows to mix with as 
I have found out in the short time 
that I have been here.
Now, men, that’s going to be tradi­
tion here. What of the men going 
through Harvard and Yale? The 
minute these men find a man with 
football ability who is soon to enter 
college, they go out of their way to 
see this man, to speak to him and en­
courage him to go to their college and 
they get a good many of the men they 
talk to that way. And why is this? 
Because their Alumni are active and 
because the students in these colleges 
are active. We have got to get spirit, 
men. We don’t need men to come out 
for a short time but we want stickers.
We are not looking for high-priced 
athletes. We can develop good teams 
and winning team's with men who 
come here for a technical training.
Now, I hope that as the time goes 
on, next fall particularly, I will have 
an opportunity of meeting more of 
you personally and to get into closer 
touch with you. I hope you will come 
out on the field in the afternoons and 
see the men work out. We are having 
a lot of fun out there these days as the 
men who are with us will tell you. 
There are men out there who have 
never played football in their lives and 
they’re enjoying it immensely. Now, 
let us have some real red blooded 
spirit. Let us all get interested and 
look forward to next fall and say “I’m 
going to scour the community in which 
I live to encourage men to come to 
Carnegie Tech, men who will make 
real live students here.”
I hope next fall that all the men 
will be back and support the team 
right from the beginning and support 
means support in winning and los­
ing streaks. Anyone can support a 
winner but it takes a man with a big 
heart to support a loser.”

MUSICAL CLUBS AT P. C. W.
Last Friday night the Musical Clubs 
of Tech and P. C. W. sang and played 
in joint concert at the College on 
Woodland road. They were greeted 
by a large audience which practically 
filled the hall, and one which was thor­
oughly delighted by the excellent pro­
gram'.
Our Glee Club opened with “Amici” 
and “Song of the Vikings.” They also 
sang “Good Night” and “Mynheer Van 
Duyck.” The P. C. W. Mandolin 
Club followed with the “Polish Dance 
and later on gave an excellent rendi­
tion of Shubert’s “Serenade.” One of 
the best numbers was the Quartette 
number “With Moonlight Beaming,” 
given by Misses Loftus, Trimble, Ford 
and Robb; they were well received. 
The P. C. W. Glee Club is of very 
high quality. They sang with an ease 
and grace which characterized great 
training. Some of their numbers 
were “W’en de Weather Rainin’ ” “A 
Hong Kong Romance,” “Dance of the 
Leaves,” “Chit Chat.” The combined 
number, P. C. W. Glee and Tech Glee, 
was the “Spring Song” by Piusuti. It 
was well done and merited favorable 
criticism. Tech’s Mandolin Club made 
a decisive hit with their “March Mili- 
taire” and “Berceuse” and they were 
repeatedly called back to which they 
liberally responded. Both clubs joined 
in the Alma Maters of each school and 
thereby wound up the program.
A very delightful dance and recep­
tion was held after the concert.
A phonograph is used in gym class­
es at Boston Tech. We have a man 
at the piano (sometimes), but have 
never noticed that the music made 
for greater unity of motion in the ex­
ercises. Perhaps gym classes become 
tiresome without musical accompani­
ment.

about ten yards in the lead, but Hem- 
mann of the lower class gradually 
made up the distance and won out by 
several yards.
Taken as a whole the meet was suc­
cessful for two important reasons; 
first, because of the large number of 
entries it attracted, and second, be­
cause of the performances of several 
men who displayed Varsity qualifica­
tions and who perhaps would never 
have ventured to compete were it not 
in some such informal manner as an 
inter-class meet.

CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY 
MEETING.
Concrete Piles was the subject of a 
completely illustrated talk by William
F. Hall, manager of the Pittsburgh 
branch of the Raymond Concrete Pile 
Company, given in Room 55, Science 
building Wednesday evening, April 15, 
at the meeting of the Civil Engineer­
ing Society. A good attendance of 
twenty or more listened to the lecture.
Although Mr. Hall spoke on con­
crete piles in general, it was to show 
the superiority of the Raymond which 
are used in the new bridge at the 
Point. The Raymond Pile is made by 
first driving a sheet steel casing, which 
is reinforced with a heavy steel wire, 
spirally wound, and into which a col­
lapsible core fits. After the casing is 
driven, the core is collapsed and re­
moved, and then the cavity is filled 
with concrete. This is entirely differ­
ent from the method of first moulding 
the pile, and then driving it through an 
intervening cushion of rubber, saw­
dust or the like to break the shock.
The Raymond people’s cost for driv­
ing their standard pile, which is thirty 
feet long, twenty inches across at the 
butt, and ten near the point, is one 
dollar a foot, including all material. 
The taper of the pile results in the 
support of the load all along its length 
as well as in holding the pile up.
The relative cost of the wooden and 
concrete piles was well shown in the 
example of a certain big job where 
840 Raymond piles took the place of 
2300 wooden ones, at one-half the cost 
for wood. The load fixed by law for 
the concrete pile is thirty tons, but Mr. 
Hall told how, by their system of 
daily adding a weight to the piles un­
der test, they would withstand a hun­
dred ton load.
A committee was appointed to confer 
with Prof. Mott relative to obtaining 
a club room for the society.
SEAL HUNTING.
^Continued from Issue of April 2—1914 
By John S. Taylor.
DIARY OF SEAL HUNTING.
March 27.—Wind S. W. ' Excellent 
weather. Bearing up for port at last. 
The old ship is heavily laden and at 
our present speed it would not be 
safe to strike a submerged cake of 
ice, for our cargo is very lively. New 
moon with the Aurora Borealis and 
sky aflame with stars was the feature 
of this night and one I shall never 
forget.
Mar'ph 28.—Wind S. W. Soft and 
clear. Passed Grand Lake 5.30 a. m. 
Something apparently wrong with her 
bows as torches are flashing in that 
quarter. Ice open and ship making 
good weather. 10:00 a. m.—Hair 
cropped by one of the firemen. It 
resembled a stairs. 3:30 p. m.—Shot 
one Hood seal and the last. 7:30 
p. m.—Very foggy weather, thick 
weather “lay to” until 1:45 a. m. 
Next morning “stand by” being the 
order from the “bridge” as we are not 
sure of our position. Wind chopped 
to N. E. Thick snow showers blow­
ing a gale.
March 29.—Wind N. E., blowing a 
hurricane. Passed “Cape Bonavistta” 
10:00 a. m. and “Cape Baccalieu” at 
2:00 p. m. These capes are very bold 
in appearance, rising to a height of
300 feet sheer from the ocean level. 
6:00 p. m.—Dropped our anchor in 
port. All well. Union Jack at half 
mast. 6:30.—Home again and a glad 
welcome. I feel satisfied, the experi­
ence was worth while.
March 30, at 9:00 a. m.—Warped in­
to our berth at the pier. 10:00 a. m. 
—Landed the body of our dead fire­
man. 10:30.—Discharged cargo which 
occupied three days. Total turn out 
19,976 pelts. Approximate value $60,-
000. 12 m.—Off watch. Visited a
barber to have whiskers removed.
April 4, 1906.—Paid off.

MANUFACTURE OF LIME.
Editor’s Note:—This is the fourth
of a series of articles by graduates of 
the School of Applied Science. The 
following article, by S. E, Young, ’10, 
Chemical, will be found of interest, 
not only on account of the writer be­
ing a graduate but also because of 
the subject treated. Mr. Young is 
located with the Bureau of Mines, 
U. S. Government.
Lime is a product resulting from the 
decomposition of calcium carbonate. 
The carbonate is found in nature in 
the form of marble and limestone and 
is very widely distributed. In the 
United States the stone is found in 
every state in the union and is mined 
or quarried in all excepting three— 
Louisiana, Delaware, and North Da­
kota. In these the deposits lie in 
such a way as to make them practi­
cally useless so far as commercial 
work is concerned.
The Industry is one of the oldest 
known to man and was probably car­
ried on to some extent by the early 
Egyptians. We have records and evi­
dences of the use of lime during the 
Roman Period in the construction of 
brick and mortar. It was manufac­
tured at that time by making a pile 
of alternate layers of wood and stone 
to any desired height and then sur­
rounding the entire mass with stone, 
leaving an opening at the bottom to 
supply a little fuel if necessary and 
draft. The fuel was lighted and al­
lowed to burn until all was exhausted. 
The heat generated was sufficient to 
decompose the stone. When the mass
had colled enough to permit handling
the outer shell was drawn off and
the lime removed and used for what­
ever it was intended. Lime burned in 
this way always contained the ash
from the fuel and usually is of poor 
quality. All stones do not require the 
same temperature to decompose them 
so that it can easily be seen that with 
the above treatment some stones will 
be heated too high and some too low. 
When there has been an insufficient 
amount of heat added there will re­
sult some lime containing unburned 
stone. This core, as it is called, will 
not slake as lime will do when water 
is added to it and goes to make up 
a lot of the waste inert material. Con­
sequently the quantity of the lime is 
impaired and is considered poor. Of 
course the unburned stone can be 
picked out at the place of manufacture 
but hand picking is expensive and men 
are careless. When the stone has 
been heated to too high a temperature, 
combination between the lime and 
other compounds found in the stone 
will result forming a kind of a semi­
vitrified slag. This compound covers 
the lime particles, will probably never 
slake or if so, very slowly, and also 
goes to greatly impair the quality of 
the lime. This slag cannot be re­
moved by any means.
Obviously to obtain good working 
conditions and good lime some other 
means of burning had to be adopted. 
At the present time a steel shell lined
with fire brick is used. The shell is 
usually either round or square in sec­
tion, of various diameters, and is from 
three to five times as long as wide. 
The lining is from eighteen to twen­
ty-four inches thick and is elliptical, 
or round, or square in cross section. 
At the bottom of the kiln, as such a 
construction is called, are holes where 
the fires are made to supply the heat.
Another type of kiln is one similar 
to that used in the Cement industry 
but as yet it has not received very uni­
versal adoption because of many me­
chanical difficulties connected with it 
and on account of the kind of lime it 
produces.
In a general and very brief way 
this covers the lime industries as we 
find it today. Of course improvements 
are being made but these are slow. 
. The manufacturer need not be a tech­
nical man and in fact the industry is 
chiefly composed of men who have 
had their training from experience. In 
nearly every case the first has not 
enough money to employ a technical 
man and if it did it would not have 
enough work to keep him busy. Any 
man with a practical knowledge of 
quarrying and of handling men can 
take care of the superintending of the 
plant. The brains of the business is 
chiefly in the selling end and in this 
branch is where good men are needed. 
However any good salesman can eas­
ily sell the product.
Some time ago there appeared an ar­
ticle in one of the trade papers parti­
ally covering the outlook in this work 
and the author in part said the follow­
ing: “It is to be expected that a busi­
ness which requires so small an initial 
outlay of capital and that is so simple 
that the ordinary man can undertake 
it with fair success, would remain in 
a somewhat crude and primitive con­
dition. It is impossible for the indi­
vidual producer to retain the services 
or engineers and experts to introduce 
economics and the best methods of 
burning, since the output of the plant 
could not warrant the expense."
In regard to the work of the Gov­
ernment in this work it might be said 
that their field is a little broader than 
that of actual manufacturer of lime. 
They are testing lime physically and 
chemically and endeavoring to draw 
up a set of specifications for it for use 
in their work and for the building laws 
of different cities.
The work is of interest only to the 
Chemist, but to the graduates of C. I. 
T. the writer wishes a better field than 
one can find under this branch of gov­
ernment work. The policy of the Bu­
reau conducting the research work 
seems to be that if one man is kept 
in charge who is thorough and compe­
tent they will pay him a fair salary. 
He can secure as many assistants as 
deemed necessary to aid him in the 
work but their compensation will be 
as small as possible. A man in this 
kind of work really has no incentive 
as the work is not rushed and really 
has nothing for a future to which to 
look forward. He will get into a rut 
and lose all the initiative and progres­
siveness that he ever had.
At the Alvin Theater next Monday 
night E. H. Sothern begins a week’s 
engagement which will take on unus­
ual interest through the first produc­
tion in this city of Justin Huntley Mc­
Carthy’s new play “Charlemagne.” 
Following is the arrangement of the 
repertoire for the week: Monday and
Tuesday nights, “If I Were King;” 
Wednesday matinee, “Lord Dun­
dreary;” Wednesday night, “Hamlet;” 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights 
and Saturday matinee, “Charlebagne.”
DUQUESNE—“THE STRANGER.”
An unusual theatrical event is sched­
uled at the Duquesne for the week 
beginning next Monday matinee, April 
27, when the Harry Davis Players will 
present for the first time in Pittsburgh 
“The Stranger,” Wilton Lackaye’s 
great success, a gripping story of the 
Southland.
It offers exceptional opportunity for 
Mr. Elton and Miss Hall; in fact the 
entire cast of the Davis Players.
Advance sale of seats is now on at 
the box office of the Duquesne.
GRAND.
Patrons of the Grand Opera House 
may count upon delectable diversion 
for the week beginning Monday after­
noon, April 27th. Gus Edwards, the 
popular composer of popular songs, 
is going to bring his new edition of 
“A Kid Kabaret” with a company of 
twenty “kid komics” including Eddie 
Cantor and George Jessel.
This is the merriest young musical 
comedy that the busy Edwards has 
produced and in the cast, as an extra 
feature for the engagemnet in Pitts­
burgh, he is announcing “Little Geòr­
gie” and Cute “Cuddles,” the two clev­
erest prodigies that have come from 
his remarkable theatrical kindergar­
ten. They are the youngest children 
appearing in vaudeville and certainly 
the most capable, for “Little Geòrgie” 
is giving impersonations of famous 
players, past and present, of comedy 
and tragedy that are as faithful as any­
thing a veteran mimic has offered. 
He and Cuddles are on the program 
to interpret a modernized version of 
an old nursery tale entitled “Mother 
Hubbard Was a Wise Old Dame.” 
Little Betty Washington, another tal­
ented youngster, is a violin virtuoso 
who will play a cycle of selections in 
artistic style. "The Kid Kabaret” rep­
resents a scene in a Broadway Cafe 
where gifted vaudevillians are enter­
taining the diners. It is a round of 
gayety and presents the various mem­
bers of Mr. Edwards’ company in de­
lightful characterizations. There are 
ten fine singing numbers, including so­
los, duos and ensembles and ranging 
through all the Edwards musical 
moods. Special scenery and bright 
costumes will add to its attractive­
ness. An exceptional novelty in the 
bill of the forthcoming week is prom­
ised in Derkin’s European dog and 
monkey pantomime, a performance in 
which animal actors are the only play­
ers. It is called “A Scene in Dogville 
on a Busy Day” and abounds with 
comical situations. The Trans-Atlan­
tic trio will introduce a musical offer­
ing in a scene of fifty years ago, in 
which the tunes of long ago will be 
played and sung by the gifted soprano, 
Harriet Keys and the instrumental vir­
tuosi, Harry Clark and Lillian Clark. 
Leo Zarrel and Company, a trio of 
physical comedians, will do some very 
amusing things in the way of acrobat­
ics. Minnie Allen, a magnetic soubrette, 
is to sing a group of songs with cos­
tume changes. Her characterizations 
are most effective and Miss Allen, 
who has exceptional versatility, will 
vary her songs with a little bit of chat­
ter and some magic. Burns and Kis- 
sen, song-writers, will sing their own 
ditties. They have excellent voices 
and their interpretation is most ar­
tistic.
This and sundry other attractions, in 
addition to moving pictures, complete 
the list of attractions.
Seven-year-old Mary was studying 
her Sunday school Bible lesson. For 
several minutes she was still as a 
mouse, but a pucker between her brow 
betoken deep thought. Finally she 
asked:
“Mamma, how old are babies be­
fore they can talk?”
“You began talking when you were 
two years old, dear.”
“Don’t they begin any younger than 
that?”
“Not very often, dear.”
“Never when they are very, very 
young?”
“No, dear; why do you ask?” 
“Because it says here in my Bible, 
‘Job cursed the day he was born.’ ”
