On Monday, there was talk of 
conflict and peace in McConomy. 
A lecture, titled “U.S., Syria, 
and The New Old Middle East: 
Confrontation or Cooperation,” 
brought out voices from all sides 
of the debate, who engaged in a 
heated discussion.
The conflict in question was that 
among the U.S., Syria, and other 
Middle Eastern countries and the 
talk was led by Imad Moustapha, 
Syria’s ambassador to the U.S.
The lecture was brought to Car­
negie Mellon by the efforts of the 
University Lecture Series and the 
newly re-founded Arab Student 
Organization (ASO).
Sustainable Earth urges 
presidents to go green

Across the nation, university 
presidents are signing the Presi­
dents Climate Commitment, a 
pledge aimed at addressing global 
warming by encouraging institu­
tional change. As of now, almost 
500 schools are participants in the 
American College and University 
Presidential Climate Commitment 
program, including the University 
of Pennsylvania, New York Uni­
versity, and Cornell University.
Sustainable Earth, an 
on-campus organization that pro­
motes green initiatives, is hoping 
to make Carnegie Mellon next 
through a number of campus- 
wide efforts, such as petitions and

Lawsuit questions Blackboard’s role in academia
DAWN WANG
Junior Staffwriter
A court victory for Blackboard 
last Monday has placed today’s 
market for learning management 
systems (LMS) in the national 
media spotlight. Blackboard is 
an electronic file transfer system 
for courses that allows professors 
and students to post and share 
information.
Blackboard sued a smaller 
competitor, Desire2Learn, for 
patent infringement and was 
awarded $3.1 million in a favor­
able decision by the court. The 
decision was based on Black­
board’s patent, one which has 
been largely criticized for allow­
ing the company to monopolize 
approximately 80 percent of the 
industry, according to/ Inside 
Higher Ed.
Although Blackboard had re­
quested $17 million, the fact 
that it won the case based on 
dozens of examples of patent in­
fringements has prompted many 
questions by the LMS market re­
garding the role of Blackboard 
and other services in higher 
education.
The court case, began the very 
day after Blackboard was granted 
its patent by the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office in 2006.
The patent grants Blackboard 
control over not only its specific 
items and manner of presen­
tation but also over the ideas 
behind the website. Many of the 
ideas behind Blackboard are 
those claimed by all LMS compa­
nies, including class discussion 
boards and file sharing through 
digital drop boxes.
Blackboard’s acquisition of
such a patent angered many 
members of the academic 
computing community, many 
claiming that its wording is too 
absolute.
“[The patent] is antithetical 
to the way that academia makes 
progress,” said Michael Feld- 
Stein, assistant director of the 
State University of New York’s 
online learning network, in 
Wired magazine.
Carnegie Mellon Director of 
the Office of Technology Educa­
tion (OTE), Joel Smith, who also 
serves as vice provost and chief 
information officer, agreed with 
Feldstein.
“I think it unfortunate that 
Blackboard chose to apply for ... 
a very broad patent... because of 
the effect of dampening innova­
tion in the field,” Smith said.
Blackboard claimed in a press
release that such a patent is nec­
essary to “protect its $100 million 
investment in the technology.”
In 2005, Blackboard accounted 
for 60 percent of the LMS mar­
ket, but the company expanded 
even more when it acqiiired its 
closest competitor in the market, 
WebCT, also in the same year.
Although Blackboard may 
dominate the industry, LMS com­
panies have become increasingly 
popular at colleges and universi­
ties across the nation.
According to Eduventures, a 
Boston online-learning research 
company, 46 percent of classes 
within 90 percent of colleges uti­
lize LMSs.
LMSs are developing at an 
extremely rapid rate. Though 
formerly limited to displaying

“I met the ambassador through 
a journalist friend when I was 
visiting Syria this summer,” said 
Mansour Nehabi, a junior eco­
nomics major and president of 
ASO. “We got to talking and he 
said he would come speak.” 
Moustapha spoke on the U.S. 
misconceptions of the current 
state of the Middle East, as well 
as the need for U.S. involvement 
in Middle Eastern affairs to facili­
tate peace.
While Moustapha recognized 
the serious nature of the topics, he 
maintained a sense of humor.
“His humor allowed him to 
frame issues in his favor and ef­
fectively argue that the U.S.

awareness, before ultimately pre­
senting the pledge to Carnegie 
Mellon President Jared L. Cohon 
in April.
By signing the commitment, a 
university president is agreeing to 
a number of environmental initia­
tives at the university.
Among the obligations, the 
president is required to create 
a committee that will guide the 
process of eventually eliminating 
a campus’ greenhouse gases and 
publish a plan within two years 
with target dates and milestones 
for the final gas elimination.
The president is also charged 
with keeping the campus commu­
nity involved through publicized 
committee progress reports.

What undergraduates will pay next year
Jessica Thurston/Forum Editor
HEATHER TOMKO
Junior Staffwriter
The value of a Carnegie Mel­
lon education will rise everi 
higher this coming school year
— in tuition and fees, at least. 
Incoming first-years will be 
paying the lOth-highest col­
lege tuition in the nation for the
2008-2009 school year.
The price list was made by The 
Chronicle of Education, which 
annually ranks colleges and 
universities nationwide based 
on their tuitions and fees.
Carnegie Mellon has an­
nounced a tuition increase 
beginning in the 2008 fall se­
mester that will be tiered, or 
based on students’ entering 
years.
Incoming first-years will see 
a 6 percent increase from the 
current tuition, raising the total 
to $39,150.
While this increase may seem 
large, The Chronicle of Higher 
Education reported that college 
tuitions increase by an average 
of 6 percent annually.
Last year, incoming first- 
years paid $35,984 for tuition 
and fees.
Current undergraduates will 
be seeing a 4 percent increase. 
Students that entered the 
university in 2005, 2006, and 
2007, will pay $35,780, $37,000, 
and $38,430, respectively.
Even with the rise in tuition, 
Carnegie Mellon’s costs are still 
slightly below those of the most 
expensive college in the nation,
Landmark College in Putney, 
Vt., where tuition and fees alone 
cost $41,275.
The top five most expen­
sive colleges and universities 
are rounded out by George 
Washington University, Texas 
Culinary Academy, Kenyon Col­
lege, and Bucknell University.
In addition to Carnegie Mel­
lon’s tuition increase, room 
and board costs for all students 
will see a 4.1 percent increase, 
bringing the estimated total 
to $5,860 for room and $4,160 
for board, which includes esti­
mated food costs, dorm activity 
fees, and other residential fees 
such as laundry, according to a 
Carnegie Mellon press release.
However, these costs do not 
include books, supplies, or any
other personal costs. As men­
tioned in the press release, stu­
dents who entered in 2007 will 
pay an estimated $51,355 for 
tuition, room, board, and these 
personal costs such as books.
“The increase will help us 
to maintain the quality [of our 
educational programs] and pro­
vide a positive experience that 
allows students to lay the foun­
dation for future success, both 
professionally and personally,” 
said William Elliott, Carnegie 
Mellon’s vice president for En­
rollment, in the press release.
Tuition is used to sustain 
and grow programs at Carn­
egie Mellon, and to support the

Bush founds own library and museum at SMU
SARAH MOGIN
Editor-in-Chief
On Friday, Feb. 22, Southern 
Methodist University (SMU) 
announced that it will host the 
Bush Library Center. This will 
include a presidential library, 
a collection of archives related 
to a president’s tenure, and an 
institute, which members from 
the George W. Bush Presiden­
tial Library Foundation have 
expressed will “celebrate” the 
president’s terms in office, ac­
cording to a Feb. 25 article from 
Inside Higher Ed.
Overseen by the U.S. National 
Archives and Records Admin­
istration, presidential libraries 
hold the papers, collections, 
and other relevant records of 
U.S. presidents. The tradition 
of presidential libraries began 
with Herbert Hoover, the 31st
president.
SMU is significant to the Bush 
administration for a variety of 
reasons.
Laura Bush graduated from 
the university with a degree in 
education, and Dick Cheney 
served as a trustee before he be­
came vice president.
Additionally, the university 
is located near Dallas, Texas, 
where President Bush and his 
family will likely live after his 
second term in office is over, ac­
cording to The New York Times.
Since its proposal in late 
2006, the Bush Library Center 
has garnered mixed reactions 
from SMU faculty members.
“SMU’s faculty is deeply di­
vided about the library. Many 
of the faculty have opposed the 
plans out of concern not only 
for SMU but for academia as a 
whole,”' stated Alexis McCros-
sen, an associate professor of 
history at SMU, in an e-mail.
“The Bush Institute intro­
duces outright partisanship to 
the university.”
Indeed, most of the contro­
versy surrounding the Bush 
Library Center pertains spe­
cifically to the institute. Unlike 
the presidential library, which 
should offer non-biased records 
of Bush’s terms in office, the in­
stitute has an agenda to explore 
and further the president’s ideas, 
as reported in Inside Higher Ed.
“The deal was that it would 
be independent of the school 
and yet on school property,” 
said Mark W. Norris, the former 
editor-in-chief of The Daily Cam­
pus, SMU’s student newspaper.
The Bush Institute will include 
one or two board members from 
the university, but some faculty 
members are worried that it will
not be enough.
In a Feb. 26 article in The 
Chronicle of Higher Education, 
SMU history professor Edward
S. Countryman cited the foun­
dation’s ability to deny SMU’s 
board nominees as a dangerous 
loophole. In theory, the foun­
dation could repeatedly deny 
nominees until the university 
proposed a board member that 
the foundation approved of.
“The veto power seems ab­
solute and discretionary on the 
Bush Foundation’s part,” Coun­
tryman wrote, as quoted in The 
Chronicle.
Still, some faculty argue that 
the benefits of the Bush Library 
Center, particularly the presi­
dential library, make it a worth­
while endeavor for the univer­
sity.

Students compete for the Mr. Fraternity crown
This past Friday, the sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta hosted their annual Mr. Fraternity pageant in 
honor of Karin Johnson, a Theta sister who died during her sophomore year of college of an acute 
asthma attack in 1984. All proceeds went to a foundation established in her name. Contestants par­
ticipated in swimwear, talent, toga, and question and answer categories. The winner was Mr. Beta 
Theta Pi (seen above), Dan Smyers, a sophomore in the Mellon'College of Science.
This Friday is the start of spring break at Carnegie Mellon, the 
University of Pittsburgh, and many other institutions nationwide. While 
some students head off to the beach or to Europe, others go home to 
sleep off weeks of college work. Here is a look at some statistics on the

Researcher analyzes enjoyment
A new study by a Carnegie Mellon 
social psychologist is leading scientists 
to question the benefit of following 
your gut.
The psychologist, Carey Morewedge, 
along with Harvard psychology pro­
fessor Daniel Gilbert, have found that 
an individual’s rush to predict his or 
her own enjoyment in expected situ­
ations may lead to unhappiness. In 
other words, the research suggests that 
happiness comes not in the most ex­
pected occasions, but rather in those 
events where it is difficult to picture 
self-enjoyment.
Gilbert suggested that just as much 
enjoyment can be gained out of a pre­
dictably boring study group as can be 
attained from a predictably fun trip to 
the beach for example. Once a person 
gets involved in a study group and 
exchanges stories with classmates, the
experience captures his attention and 
the trip to the beach falls to the back 
of his mind, the leaving the possible 
enjoyment of that event far in the past.
The idea is summed up in Gilbert’s 
concept of “attentional collapse,” which 
suggests that when an individual is 
in the midst of an engaging experi­
ence, his or her imagination tunes into 
the moment, making any past notions 
quickly evaporate.
Gilbert has researched the concept of 
happiness before. In 2006, he wrote a 
book, Stumbling on Happiness, in which 
he discussed his finding that when 
faced with an irrevocable decision, 
people are happier with the outcome 
than when they have the opportunity 
to change their minds.
His most recent research was fea­
tured in the Feb. 19 issue of Time 
magazine.
Professor wins early career honor
Faculty members lead the way in their respective fields
Carnegie Mellon’s Jeremy J. Michalek 
became the sixth assistant profes­
sor in Carnegie Mellon’s department 
of mechanical engineering to obtain 
the Faculty Early Career Development 
Award.
One of the National Science 
Foundation’s most celebrated distinc­
tions, the award recognizes scholars 
who show promise of developing into 
prominent academic leaders of the 21st 
century.
Michalek will invest his prize, the five- 
year, $400,000 grant, in analyzing how 
an aspect of public policy such as fuel- 
economy standards might decide what 
kinds of more efficient vehicles are built 
in the future and how consumers might 
react.
In his study, Michalek aims to bet­
ter understand the strengths and weak­
nesses of potential new technologies. He
hopes to be able to predict consumers’ 
choices and the reactions of profit-seek- 
ing automakers in the regulated market­
place.
His research comes at an extremely 
relevant time, with a $1 per gallon price 
jump observed during each of the last 
two springs. Furthermore, recent trends 
predict this year’s average price to rise 
to a record $3.50 a gallon or more by 
June, according to the Carnegie Mellon 
website.
The U.S. government has been pres­
suring the auto industry to study alterna­
tives to fossil fuels for years, and recently 
passed the Energy Independence and 
Security Act, aimed at stopping harmful 
emissions and further developing renew­
able fuels.

Sustainable Earth urges university to 
join Presidents Climate Commitment
Commitment urges university presidents to get greener
EARTH, from A1
Other responsibilities include integrating sus­
tainability into the curriculum of certain classes, 
in addition to completing an emissions inventory 
on campus with the ultimate goal of elimiriating 
carbon and greenhouse emissions.
In November, the program announced a part­
nership with the William J. Clinton Foundation, 
in which five of the world’s largest banks, ABN 
AMRO, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan 
Chase, and UBS, contribute funds to allow uni­
versities to take on the commitment without 
increasing their expenses.
“This is an important place to start changing 
minds,” Clinton said in a press release. “It’s not 
true that green schools aren’t affordable.”
The partnership includes funding of $1 billion 
from eaqh of the five banks, and allows colleges 
to enter into a purchasing consortium for energy 
efficient products.
Sustainable Earth has been hard at work pro­
moting environmental awareness and preparing 
a petition to present to President Cohon in favor 
of signing the commitment.
This Thursday, Sustainable Earth will be ta­
bling in front of Doherty Hall and performing a 
themed skit at the Fence to get more signatures 
for the petition.
However, students remain unconvinced as 
to the leverage of the commitment in actually 
changing universities nationwide.
“Many say that the [commitment] doesn’t have 
much grip and in a way it doesn’t,” said Austin 
Redwood, a sophomore Humanities and Arts 
Scholar and president of Sustainable Earth. “But 
as an idea, it has a lot of weight. It’s adaptable 
and makes sure that changes are institutional­
ized, something that both students and faculty 
can commit to.”
Sarah Strano, a sophomore civil engineering 
major and vice president of Sustainable Earth, 
agreed with Redwood.
“The [commitment] is a good first step in re­
vamping the thinking.... Carnegie Mellon has 
done a good job to going towards sustainable 
practices with many different programs already 
implemented,” Strano said.
Redwood echoed Strano’s confidence in the 
green programs Carnegie Mellon currently has 
in place.
“Carnegie Mellon is making a great effort 
to make our school more sustainable. There 
are many green practices and recycling pro­
grams that are effective,” he said.
Strano and Redwood mentioned some of Car­
negie Mellon’s existing green initiatives, from 
environmental organizations based on different 
majors and concentrations to green roofs and 
LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design) friendly buildings.
“[The Presidents Climate Commitment] is the 
next step or leap,” Strano said. “Many schools 
that have already signed have nothing and are 
starting their green practices from scratch. 
We’re already a few steps ahead of the game and 
just need to make greater strides towards the 
future.”
Many students agree that since global warming 
and other environmental issues are of growing 
importance in today’s society, universities and 
colleges are ideal atmospheres for change.
“Many schools that have already 
signed have nothing and are starting 
their green practices from scratch. 
We’re already a few steps ahead of 
the game."
—Sarah Strano
“We are turning out the world’s future leaders, 
in particular business leaders. In our world that 
is becoming more and more market based, we’re 
putting out those who will make bigger changes 
down the line and use their power to help,” Red­
wood said.
Strano stressed the importance of education 
on implementing these ideas for improvement — 
another reason that an academic setting is con­
ducive to environmental change.
“In making an impact, education is one of the 
most important things. In tabling or holding peti­
tions, we’re educating people. Many don’t realize 
how big of a deal this really is nor do they under­
stand the whole issue,” Strano said.
Strano and Redwood commented that regard­
less of whether or not a commitment has been 
signed, it is the duty of every member of the 
community to do what they can to live more sus­
tainable lives.
“Our role as students is to do our part because 
there is still room for improvement.... Start a re- 
cycle-a-thon. Turn off the lights,” Redwood said. 
“Simple easy things can make a huge impact.”

SMU President R. Gerald Turner (left center) shakes hands with Donald Evans (right center), chair of the 
George W. Bush Presidential Library Foundation and chair of the Library Site Selection Committee on Feb. 22.
SMU reacts to Bush library and 
museum on campus grounds
BUSH, from A1
“I think that SMU has made 
the right decision,” said James 
F. Hollifield, a professor of po­
litical science at the university. “I 
think it’s good for us to put these 
kinds of institutes on university 
campuses,” he added, noting the 
potential for presidential librar­
ies to attract scholarly study.
As a graduate student and pro­
fessor at Duke University, Hol­
lifield witnessed a debate for an­
other presidential library, that of 
Richard Nixon. Following contro­
versy on campus, the university
announced that it would not 
house the Nixon library in 1982.
“My argument was that that 
was a mistake on the part of 
Duke,” Hollifield said, speaking 
of an op-ed he wrote for The New 
York Times on Jan. 20, 2007.
Hollifield added that it would 
be valuable, over 25 years after 
the Nixon library’s controversy, 
for a university to have the Nixon 
tapes on its campus.
“I think that over time all these 
institutes are good institutes to 
have,” he said. “We forget that 
there were ... other controversial 
presidents.”
The Lyndon Baines Johnson Li­
brary and Museum, on the cam­
pus of the University of Texas at 
Austin, was another highly de­
bated presidential library in its 
time, Hollifield added.
Although SMU faculty mem­
bers have been vocal about the 
Bush Library Center, Norris said 
that students are less concerned 
about the issue.
“Student on the campus didn’t 
care [when the center was first 
proposed],” he said. “The char­
acter of students here is passively 
supportive of the library.”

Students support Barack Obama
On Wednesday night, CMU Students for Barack Obama gathered in Doherty Hall to discuss campaign 
issues and hear from the Western Pennsylvania field director of Obama’s national campaign. Maria 
Mauro, the organization’s president, led the discussion and introduced the speaker. Mauro spoke of 
the organization’s goal to register 1000 students to vote in Pennsylvania for 2008 elections. Mauro 
also mentioned the importance of this issue in Pennsylvania, one of this year’s swing states. The 
representative talked of recruiting students who went to Ohio for the day last Saturday to participate 
in the Obama campaign. The discussion also included comments from students.
Blackboard’s court victory prompts 
accusations of market monopoly
Decision has led many to question Blackboard’s patent
PATENT, fromAl
syllabi and hosting links, LMSs 
are now being used to run entire 
classes online.
Blackboard has been Carnegie 
Mellon’s LMS since its adoption 
by the OTE in 2000.
Smith said that the comput­
ing world at Carnegie Mellon has 
benefited greatly since Black­
board’s introduction.
“It has been a reliable tool and 
heavily used on campus,” Smith 
said.
However, Smith also pointed 
out that with the technol­
ogy’s rapidly changing course,
challengers are emerging.
While Smith noted the reli­
ability of Blackboard’s service, 
he also cited its lack of unique­
ness.
“There is little about Black­
board that makes it special.... 
Blackboard’s authorization sys­
tem is important ... individual 
and group authorization fea­
tures are special in that sense,” 
Smith said.
Smith said that Carnegie Mel­
lon is open to switching from 
Blackboard to another LMS, but 
that the decision cannot be taken 
lightly. There is a definite need, 
Smith emphasized, for an online
course management system.
“OTE typically gets arounc 
1000 requests for sites each se 
mester,” he said.
“Any transition must be doni 
thoughtfully because it involve: 
a substantial transfer of data anc 
users getting accustomed to new 
terminology and a new inter 
face.”
Smith noted that the switch 
if made, will be an informec 
decision, following an extendec 
period of consideration.
“We will have an answer ir 
time to make decisions for the
2009-2010 academic year,” he 
said.
In wake of recent college shootings, 
campuses focus on security changes
• AMANDA WILCZYNSKI
Junior Staffwriter
The gunman at Virginia Tech 
last April and the recent shoot­
ings at Northern Illinois Uni­
versity have led to increased 
attention to campus crime. Nu­
merous new safety precautions 
have been made nationwide at 
college campuses.
However, despite these two 
recent shocking events, a recent 
report shows that college vio­
lent crime rates decreased by 9 
percent from 1994 to 2004.
The study, released by the 
Bureau of Justice the week after 
the Illinois shooting, measured 
changes at four-year institu­
tions nationwide. Along with 
the decrease in violent crime, 
property crimes decreased by 
30 percent.
The report also found that 
almost all campuses have some 
form of emergency prepared­
ness plans, with nearly nine out 
of 10 colleges utilizing armed 
patrols. Many large campuses 
have created substantial secu­
rity staffs, such as New York 
University, which has a staff of 
345 individuals, according to 
the study.
However, despite such fa­
vorable statistics, the recent 
campus shootings have caused 
many universities to re-evalu­
ate their procedures.
Carnegie Mellon increased its 
safety efforts after the Virginia 
Tech shooting last April.
The AlertNow Emergency 
Service was implemented late 
last April; it notifies the cam­
pus community of emergencies 
via voice messages and text 
messages. Over 6500 students, 
faculty, and staff have already 
signed up, according to a uni­
versity press release.
However, Lieutenant John 
Race from Carnegie Mellon 
University Police noted in a
previous interview that campus 
security can only go so far.
“Events like this are very dif­
ficult to prevent and even more 
difficult to predict,” Race stated 
in an e-mail about the llinois 
tragedy.
“[The NIU] suspect had not 
exhibited any known strange 
or dangerous behavior that was 
known to anyone at the univer­
sity and planned and executed 
the act by himself,” Race con­
tinued. “The suspect’ did not 
issue any warnings or threats, 
nor did he tell anyone else of his 
plans.”
Although some violent in­
cidents may • come without 
warning, Carnegie Mellon Pres­
ident Jared Cohon stressed the 
importance of continuing to be 
careful while on campus.
“We should use this oppor­
tunity to remind ourselves to 
be vigilant and report any ab­
normal or suspicious activity 
we observe to the appropriate 
authorities,” Cohon said in a 
campus-wide e-mail respond- 
. ing to the Northern Illinois 
shooting.
Carnegie Mellon is not the 
only campus to tighten security 
measures even further after the 
Illinois shooting.
Arkansas* Technical Univer­
sity is one such university where 
precautions have reached a 
whole new level.
A student production of As­
sassins, a musical in which 
characters play historic figures 
who have attempted to kill a 
U.S. president, was scheduled 
to open last Thursday evening 
at Arkansas Tech.
According to Inside Higher Ed, 
Arkansas Tech President Robert 
C. Brown thought it best not to 
portray violent scenes in a cam­
pus production in light of the 
recent campus shooting trage­
dies. University administrators 
also worried that the gunshots
might be heard outside of the 
auditorium and cause chaos on 
campus.
Thus, the administration 
made the decision to ban it.
They did permit a final dress 
rehearsal show since the stu­
dents had worked hard on the 
production, but the wooden 
stage guns had to be cut in half 
and not used at all. Students in­
volved in the production were 
outraged with this decision.
Similarly, Yale University 
made the executive decision to 
ban the use of stage weapons in 
a student theater production af­
ter the Virginia Tech shootings.
However, Yale took back 
its ban in response to feed­
back from enraged actors and 
educators.
Students and faculty at both 
universities have expressed 
their trust in audiences of dra­
matic productions. The Yale 
administration ultimately con­
cluded that audiences of pro­
ductions involving guns are 
capable of understanding the 
difference between dramatic 
and actual violence.
Carnegie Mellon is home 
to many student productions 
throughout the year. The school 
has not banned guns in drama, 
but many students indicated 
that they would react similarly 
to those at Yale.
“I don’t believe that theater 
should be censored,” said Dana 
Weinstein, a first-year business 
administration major and mem­
ber of the student theater group 
Scotch ’n’ Soda.
Weinstein also brought. up 
that many famous musicals in­
volve guns, such as Oklahoma! 
and Guys and Dolls.'
Despite such controversial 
moves by several universities, 
the nation’s colleges share a 
common goal, to keep cam­
puses safe and prevent further 
violent incidents.

education initiatives and the 
improvement of laboratory fa­
cilities.
“Our goal is to provide the 
very best learning environment 
for our students,” Elliot stated 
in the press release.
The tuition increase was ap­
proved by the Board of Trustees 
at their Feb. 22 meeting. Before 
deciding on the increase, the 
university asked for input from 
students and parents through a 
series of open forums.
“When we talk with parents 
and students about tuition, they 
always note how important it is 
that we maintain the quality of 
our educational programs,” El­
liott commented in the press 
release.
Carnegie Mellon is consis­
tently ranked among the top 
25 research universities by 
U.S. News & World Report; the 
institution was ranked 22nd in 
2007, in addition to receiving 
high rankings for many of its 
individual departments.
Students had mixed reactions 
to the news.
Jill Perkins, a sophomore 
professional writing major who 
transferred to Carnegie Mellon 
last year from Duquesne said
Syrian ambassador speaks on peace for Middle East
SYRIA, fromAl
should improve' relations with 
Syria,” said Daniel Liptz, a sopho­
more mechanical engineering 
major and president of Tartans 
for Israel.
» Before becoming ambassador 
in 2004, Moustapha served as the 
dean of the faculty of informa­
tion technology at the University 
of Damascus in Syria.
“As an academic, I used to 
think that diplomats lived from 
gala to gala and cocktail party to 
cocktail party,” Moustapha said. 
He noted that his life as a diplo­
mat has been quite different from 
this stereotype.
“I found myself the ambassador 
most eligible to take Iraq’s spot in 
[President George W.] Bush’s axis 
of evil,” Moustapha said.
Addressing U.S. misconcep­
tions, Moustapha brought up 
repeated declarations by Secre­
tary of State Condoleeza Rice in 
which she cited Syria as the cause 
of problems in the region.
“The way I see it, there are two 
major problems in the Middle 
East: the Israeli-Palestinian con­
flict and the U.S. war in Iraq, and 
neither of these involve Syria,” he 
said.
Moustapha spoke of U.S. jour­
nalists, specifically at The New 
York Times and The Washington 
Post, portraying Syria in a nega­
tive light by barely publicizing 
the ways in which the country 
has helped the U.S. in times of 
need. He cited three examples of 
this assistance.
Moustapha first noted Syria’s 
immediate aid when prompted
by the U.S. to assist in the lib­
eration of Kuwait from Saddam 
'Hussein in 1990. According to 
Moustapha, Syria was eager to 
help, not only because the U.S. 
had asked them, “[but mainly] 
because we in Syria abhor occu­
pation,” Moustapha said.
His second example was the 
1991 U.S. Middle Eastern Peace 
Conference in Madrid. Syria 
played a key role in organizing 
the event with the U.S., which 
had beneficial discussions be­
tween all parties.
Moustapha’s third demonstra­
tion of Syria’s compliance was in 
their effort to assist the U.S. after 
the Sept. 11, 2001 events.
“So many countries sent letters 
of condolence to the U.S.,” Mou­
stapha said, “but we did even 
more. We made direct contact 
with the administration and of­
fered information on al Qaeda.” 
Moustapha noted that Syrian 
intelligence resulted in the abor­
tion of two attempted terrorist 
attacks on U.S. interests, one in 
Canada and another in Bahrain.
He said that these are the types 
of facts the U.S. press does not 
focus on, also speaking of the 
little-known fact that Syria con­
sulted with President Bush and 
his officials before the U.S. in­
vaded Iraq.
“We told them that invading 
Iraq would be equal to opening a 
Pandora’s box of woes and evils,” 
Moustapha said. “They refused 
our suggestions and mocked us 
to our faces.”
He also spoke of the exodus 
of refugees, including doctors 
and professors, leaving Iraq and

coming in mass numbers to Syria 
and Jordan.
“We think- of Iraqis as our 
brothers,” Moustapha said in ex­
pression of his Sympathy.
He noted Syria’s peaceful ten­
dencies. “Syria has never had 
civil war. People have never 
killed each other over sectarian 
identity,” Moustapha said.
However, while he acknowl­
edged the U.S.’s mistake in the 
Middle East, he said that U.S. 
involvement is essential in the 
peace process. The U.S. has be­
come so involved in Iraq and pro­
vides so much support to Israel, 
for example, that Middle East­
erners have no options in choos­
ing which country should take 
the lead in the peace process, 
Moustapha said.
Moustapha’s talk did not go 
without heated response from a 
number of students during the
question and answer session.
“I do think that he went out of 
his way to denigrate Israel, and 
did not acknowledge the fact that 
Syria has done its fair share to 
stall peace talks,” Liptz said.
However, Nehabi noted that 
while opinions may differ, this 
lecture was an important step­
ping stone not only for future 
ASO speakers, but for general 
discussion, of the Middle Eastern 
conflict.
Nehabi said that plans are 
underway to make this lecture 
series an annual event in col­
laboration with other student 
groups to diversify the selection 
of speakers.
“Even though people differed 
in opinions, it’s still important 
that they came out and listened,” 
he said. “That is the first step in 
any peace process.”
Tuition passes $50,000 
for student expenses
Carnegie Mellon announced a tiered 
tuition increase last Thurday that places 
it among the nation’s most expensive.
that all the money paid is well 
spent.
Perkins called Duquesne a 
moderately priced institution 
at about $32,000 a year in tu­
ition and fees.
“I really have to say that I see 
my extra money being spent 
well, and truly feel that I am in 
a better place, and that the ex­
tra 20 grand that I’m shouting 
out has already put me ahead of 
where I was last year,” Perkins 
said in an e-mail.
“The increase will help 
us to maintain the qual­
ity of our educational 
programs.”
—William Elliott
In the wake of rising tu­
ition, some Ivy League colleges 
have recently been working to 
greatly lower costs for espe­
cially needy students.
Harvard University, Princ­
eton University, Dartmouth 
College, and most recently 
Stanford University, offer free 
tuition, room and board for 
families with incomes lower 
than $60,000 while also of­
fering competitive deals for 
families with incomes up to 
$120,000.
However, Carnegie Mellon 
does not have a large enough 
endowment to do the same, 
with an endowment about 35 
times smaller than Harvard’s 
C$34.6 billion compared to $1 
billion).
As of last school year, more 
than 63 percent of Carnegie 
Mellon students receive some 
form of financial aid through 
scholarships, grants, or work- 
study, according to the press 
release.
However, according to a 
Feb. 23 article from the The 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, tuition 
alone does not cover all the 
costs needed to provide finan­
cial aid and run a university. 
For this reason, Carnegie Mel­
lon continues to find alterna­
tive means of funding through 
investments, foundations, and 
alumni donations, in addition 
to donations from current stu­
dents.
Rising tuition costs do not 
seem to be deterring potential 
new first-years.
According to the press re­
lease, as of Feb. 1, Carnegie 
Mellon received 21,747 applica­
tions for the 1360 spots in the 
incoming first-year class.

Voters concerned 
about health-care
An online survey conducted 
last month by graduate students 
at American University found 
that, overall, voters between the 
ages of 18 and 29 ranked health­
care as their third most pressing 
concern when evaluating candi-, 
dates’ positions in preparation 
for the 2008 presidential elec­
tion.
Approximately one-third of 
those surveyed thought that 
they may not have health insur­
ance in the future. The majority 
of survey respondents agreed 
that the issue was important 
because health-care affects the 
entire population, regardless of 
age or social class.
Some respondents felt that 
the institution of a universal 
healthcare system would have 
the ability to improve health 
coverage for the greatest num­
ber of citizens, while others felt 
that such a program was not 
economically feasible and that 
the government should focus 
first on other issues.

Human hair may 
hold crime clues
Researchers at the University 
of Utah discovered that local 
drinking water leaves chemical 
residues in human hair. Since 
the isotopes of hydrogen and 
oxygen in drinking water vary 
from region to region, each 
person’s hair holds a record of 
where he or she has recently 
lived or traveled. Thus when 
provided with a hair sample, 
police may be able to track the 
recent whereabouts of the crim­
inal to whom it belongs.
Researchers gathered hair 
samples from barbershops and 
tap water samples in 65 cities in 
18 states across the country and 
mapped the .change in isotope 
ratios.
The method is already being 
used by police forces, such 
as the Salt Lake City Police 
Department, to figure out the 
locations of unidentified murder 
victims prior to their deaths.

More deaths caused 
by faulty heparin
The number of deaths associ­
ated with a particular brand of 
heparin, a blood thinner made 
from pig intestines, has risen to 
21 from the original four report­
ed, according to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA). 
Federal drug regulators report 
that the source of the problem 
may be the Chinese plant that 
supplied the active ingredient 
for the drug.
The drug is distributed by 
Baxter International, which has 
since announced a recall of all of 
its heparin products to prevent 
any future deaths.
FDA officials have planned to 
conduct several further inspec­
tions, the results of which are 
pending.

Genital defects rise
Scientists in England have 
discovered an increase in the 
number of boys born with geni­
tal abnormalities, which they 
believe may be caused by envi­
ronmental chemicals.
The study, which began in 
2001, found that 7 percent of the 
700 boys tested were born with 
undescended testicles, up from
4 percent in 1992. While some 
of the boys’ testicles descended 
on their own within a couple of 
years, others required surgery.
Boys bom with undescended 
testicles are eight times more 
likely to develop testicular can­
cer and up to seven times more 
likely to be infertile.

World’s largest seed 
vault opened
The world’s largest seed vault 
opened in the frozen Arctic 
mountains of Svalbard, Norway, 
last week. The vault is capable of 
storing up to 4.5 million frozen 
seed samples at temperatures 
as low as minus 0.4°F, at which 
experts say the seeds could last 
for thousands of years.
The Svalbard seed vault, tun­
neled 425 feet deep into a fro­
zen mountain, is hardy enough 
to withstand earthquakes of 
6.2 magnitude, as well as to 
survive a direct nuclear strike. 
Construction of the seed vault 
took $9.1 million and was com­
pleted in less than a year.
European Commission 
President Jose Manuel Barroso 
called it a “frozen garden of 
Eden.” All countries can deposit 
seeds free of charge and reserve 
the right to withdraw them at 
any time.

Water on Mars 
doubtful, studies say
A recent computer simula­
tion has cast doubt on the 2006 
research suggesting presence of 
liquid water on Mars, scientists 
say.
Using images from NASA’s 
Mars Global Surveyor and Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter, com­
puter simulations now indicate 
that the bright deposits in Mars 
valleys are most likely due to 
sand and gravel landslides rath­
er than recent flowing water. 
In the simulation created by 
University of Arizona research­
ers, the geological formations 
more closely matched those left 
by dry flows of sand than those 
left by liquid water.
However, this research does 
not completely rule out the pos­
sibility that liquid water was 
indeed responsible for the flows. 
Other possibilities include heavy 
mud flows consisting of up to 60 
percent sediment.

Collider (LHC), has been 
installed. The wheel is the 
final component of the ATLAS 
particle detector — the largest 
particle detector in the LHC.
The LHC is the world’s larg­
est particle accelerator and is 
expected to open in the middle 
of this year. Eagerly awaited 
experiments lined up for the 
LHC include re-creating the 
conditions of the universe just 
before the Big Bang and study­
ing the nature of dark matter 
and energy.
The installation of this final 
component may also help scien­
tists understand how particles 
gain mass.

Snow contains bac­
teria
Up to 85 percent of the par­
ticles in snow may be bacteria, 
report scientists from Louisiana 
State University.
Water vapor in the atmo­
sphere requires particles, called 
nucleators, to condense around 
before turning into snow or rain. 
However, recent findings show 
that some of the best nuclea­
tors are actually bacteria, rather 
than dust or soot.
The most common type of 
bacteria found was Pseudomonas 
syringae, which is known to 
cause disease in several variet­
ies of plants. Whether the elimi­
nation of these bacteria would 
affect snow and rain forma­
tion, or if they would simply be 
replaced by other particles, is 
yet to be determined.

C02 emission can be reduced by transporting the gas from power plants (above) to underground storage.
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
Asst. SciTech Editor
A team of researchers led by 
professor M. Granger Morgan, 
head of the Engineering and 
Public Policy department, 
received a $1.85 million grant 
from the New York-based Doris 
Duke Charitable Foundation 
(DDCF). The team developed a 
system that safely captures car­
bon dioxide and transports it 
deep underground where it can 
be permanently stored.
According to a press release 
from the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, the grant is part of 
DDCF’s $100 million venture, 
called the “Climate Change 
Initiative,” which is aimed at cre­
ating a cleaner environment.
Development of technologies 
that help in building an envi­
ronmentally friendly future is 
therefore an intrinsic part of this 
initiative.'
While this project is anchored 
at Carnegie Mellon, researchers 
from the University of Minnesota, 
the Vermont Law School, and the 
law firm Van Ness Feldman are 
also involved in it.
The team’s primary focus is to 
reduce the emission of carbon 
dioxide as a result of excessive 
electricity consumption.
Most of the electricity in our 
country is produced by burning 
coal. However, the burning of 
coal releases large amounts of 
carbon dioxide.
This carbon dioxide is usually 
released into the air. Given the 
large amount of electricity that 
is produced nationwide, carbon 
dioxide levels in the atmosphere
are continually increasing. 
Certain properties that make car­
bon dioxide unique from other 
pollutants further add to the 
problem.
“If we stabilize emissions [of 
most other pollutants], then 
concentrations [of the pollut­
ants] also stabilize because those 
pollutants only live in the atmo­
sphere for a few hours or a few 
days,” Morgan said. “In contrast, 
carbon dioxide lives in the atmo­
sphere for a hundred years or 
more.”
The project focuses on the cru­
cial problem caused by elevated 
carbon dioxide levels and has 
come up with a solution to it.
“The basic idea is to capture 
[carbon dioxide] and put it deep 
underground, in a suitable geo­
logical formation where it will 
be permanently sequestered,” 
Morgan said.
Sean McCoy, the project man­
ager of the scheme, said that the 
carbon dioxide will be transport­
ed from industrial power plants 
through pipelines (on land) or 
by tankers (at sea) to specific 
locations. Once it is transported 
to these locations, it is injected 
underground into appropriate 
geological formations, such as a 
cave or water table.
After this, the carbon dioxide 
should remain underground for 
a relatively long period of time. 
The presence of underground 
water also helps trap the carbon 
dioxide in specific underground 
localities.
“You are injecting [carbon 
dioxide] so deep underground 
that the water at that level is 
saline and is not really useful for
any other purpose. [Carbon diox­
ide] mixes with the brine [water 
saturated with salt] and this pro­
cess helps to trap the C02 and 
reduces the risk of it escaping,” 
McCoy said.
In spite of this, there is still 
a small possibility that the car­
bon dioxide will leak back out 
into the atmosphere. However, 
Morgan asserted that this will not 
make much of a difference.
“You have to remember that 
the alternative is 100 percent 
leakage,” said Morgan. “Normal 
coal plants leak everything.”
The technology shows pros­
pects of a bright future. In fact, 
related technology is being 
implemented on smaller scales in 
different parts of the world.
Oil companies in Norway have 
been using similar techniques 
for some time. These companies 
extract natural gas, which is often 
mixed with carbon dioxide.
The process began a few years 
ago, after the Norwegian govern­
ment began to heavily tax carbon 
dioxide emitted from refineries. 
As a result, if an oil company 
emitted large amounts of carbon 
dioxide into the air, it would have 
to pay a great sum to the govern­
ment. +
In order to prevent the loss 
of money from carbon dioxide 
emission, these companies began 
injecting carbon dioxide into the 
ground. Norway has been suc­
cessfully implementing this tech­
nology for quite some time.
Although this technology is 
in use in different parts of the 
world, what makes the Carnegie 
Mellon project different from pre­
vious attempts is the large scale
at which it is being pursued.
“All the pieces for doing this 
exist at commercial scale, but 
they have never actually been 
put together at large scale,” said 
Morgan.
This project specifically tar­
gets carbon dioxide emission due 
to electricity generation at coal 
plants. Therefore, the technol­
ogy that will be developed will 
involve all the processes, from 
extracting the carbon dioxide 
from the power plants to inject­
ing and storing it underground.
Another aspect of the project is 
reducing the emission of carbon 
dioxide by implementing differ­
ent technologies.
“[The project] is a portfolio 
technology that bonds renewable, 
conservational and different 
energy generation technologies,” 
McCoy said.
Although the project will be 
affective in reducing the levels 
of carbon dioxide in the atmo­
sphere, it will not be of much 
use if large quantities of carbon 
dioxide continue to be emitted, 
nor will it be economical.
“This is really only one step. 
There are a lot of techno­
logical changes that have to 
happen in terms of usage of 
more energy-efficient applianc­
es,” McCoy said.
Strict regulations on carbon 
dioxide emission will need to be 
implemented for this project to 
be effective.
“The reason why commercial 
outfits are willing to [capture 
carbon dioxide] now is that they 
know that pretty soon there will 
be restrictions on C02 emission,” 
Morgan said.

Known for its prudent invest­
ment practices, the prestigious 
Henry L. Hillman Foundation has 
given Carnegie Mellon University 
$10 million to construct a new 
research complex, the Hillman 
Center for Future-Generation 
Technologies.
Chaired by entrepreneur Henry 
Hillman, one of the wealthiest 
men in Pittsburgh, the Henry L. 
Hillman Foundation is a grant 
establishment that has made 
multiple monetary contributions 
to hospitals and research centers 
in Pittsburgh during the last sev­
eral years.
“Research and technology 
developed at Carnegie Mellon 
that at one time seemed like sci­
ence fiction have created essential 
everyday tools for business, med­
icine, and countless other appli­
cations that we now almost take
for granted,” Hillman stated in 
a Carnegie Mellon press release. 
The foundation’s award for the 
research complex in the School 
of Computer Science (SCS) at 
Carnegie Mellon helps to form an 
alliance between two of the city’s 
most renowned names.
This contemporary research 
complex will be located between 
Cyert Hall and the Gates Center 
for Computer Science, the latter 
of which is currently being built.
The Hillman Center for Future- 
Generation Technologies will 
be yet another building in the 
SCS complex where principles of 
robotics and computer science 
will be applied at a larger scale.
“The new building will be 
linked to the Gates Center for 
Computer Science and Newell- 
Simon Hall, connecting the cor­
ridors at every level, back and 
forth without any restriction,” 
said Randal E. Bryant, dean of 
SCS.
Facing Forbes Avenue, the 
complex will extend a foot­
bridge from the balcony at the 
edge of the Purnell Center for 
the Arts, the facility that houses 
the university’s School of Drama. 
The research building will be 
designed by Mack Scogin Merrill 
Elam. Architects, a well-recog- 
nized architecture' firm based in 
Atlanta, Ga. The interior of the 
research complex will include 
sets of spiral stairs that will con­
nect to the fourth floor of Newell- 
Simon Hall.
“Some of the most important 
and forward-looking research 
at the university,— and in the 
world — is going to take place in 
this building,” Carnegie Mellon 
President Jared L. Cohon stated in 
the press release. Ranked among 
the top computer science pro­
grams in the country, SCS unites 
leaders in the fields of robotics, 
computer science, human-com- 
puter interaction, and artificial
intelligence.
“The research complex will 
enable computer scientists to 
tie together the many ends of 
research in the field,” said Cleah 
Schlueter, an administrative 
associate and project manager at 
SCS.
“It is a wonderful idea to have 
such vast space where everybody 
can collaborate their respec­
tive work, because that is what 
Carnegie Mellon is famous for
— research and collaboration,” 
she added.
According to Bryant, the 
research complex will be com­
pleted by the summer of 2009 
and work within is scheduled 
to officially commence that fall. 
The building will be entirely 
dedicated to research and will 
host a larger and more advanced 
pedestal for machine learning, a 
discipline that currently occupies 
a small space in Newell-Simon 
Hall, Bryant said.

Health Talk: Shin splints
File Photc
SABRINA PORTER
News Editor
For some of the most deter­
mined athletes, rest is a foreign 
concept. However, according to 
the American Medical Society for 
Sports Medicine, an estimated 
13.1 percent of all athletes are 
afflicted with a condition for 
which rest is the best treatment. 
This condition is known as shin 
splints.
Shin splint is the general term 
given to pain along the front or 
inside edge of the shinbone. The 
splints range in severity from 
nerve irritations to tendonitis (an 
inflammation of the tendon, the 
connection between the muscle 
and the bone) to stress fractures 
(a crack in the bone resulting 
from repeated stress).
The majority of shin splints are 
not serious and do not require 
medical attention.
Although these splints do not 
require consultation with a doc­
tor, this does not mean that they 
are not painful. Shin splints often 
hurt so badly that they make even 
the most determined athletes stop 
during their workouts.
The way shin splints are caused 
can be thought of most simply as 
stress on the muscle tissue that 
attaches to the front of the lower 
leg, which can cause the muscles 
to rip or tear.
The lower leg is made up of two 
bones: the fibula, the long thin
bone that connects the ankle to 
the knee, and the shinbone (also 
known as the tibia), which con­
sists of an anterior and posterior. 
The anterior and posterior run 
on either side of the fibula. The 
stress occurs in the muscles of 
the tibia.
The tibia’s attachment to the 
fibula and central location in the 
lower leg causes pain to shoot 
through a person’s leg.
However, the irritation is not 
evident in the entire leg; shin 
splints are often only visible 
through inflammation or swell­
ing of the tibia.
While an athlete cannot pre­
dict when a splint will occur, the 
causes behind these inflamed 
shins are well known. Each time 
a runner’s foot hits the ground, 
a shockwave travels up the leg 
starting at the musculoskeletal 
system.
Located in the lower leg, the 
musculoskeletal system is the 
network of bones, muscles, and 
joints that work together to pro­
vide the runner with the power 
to move.
The ability of the system to 
handle this shockwave depends 
on the athlete’s fitness level. If 
an athlete has not run for a very 
long time, the system can easily 
get stressed or torn.
Similarly, if athletes push them­
selves far beyond their limits in 
terms of speed or distance, the 
musculoskeletal system m^y not
be able to handle the shock.
The unique ways in which an 
athlete’s foot hits the ground can 
add complications, such as prona­
tion. For the ideal runner, prona­
tion is described as the outside 
of the heel touching the ground 
first, then the heel rolling slighdy 
inward, after which the foot lands 
flat and the ankle rolls inward.
This rotation is the reaction of 
the foot after the initial shock to 
the musculoskeletal system.
Pronation allows for the opti­
mal absorption of shock by the 
musculoskeletal system. When 
a runner faces overpronation or 
underpronation, the foot rolls 
either too much or too little 
inward, respectively. These con­
ditions are especially prominent 
among people with abnormally 
high arches, since their feet hit 
the ground at different angles 
than those with normal arches.
However, there are a number 
of risk-reducing strategies that 
all athletes can follow, regardless 
of their pronation tendencies. 
Adequate breaks between work­
outs allows the muscles to recov­
er before experiencing another 
shock.
Additionally, external factors 
such as the running surface and 
shoes play a key role in prevent­
ing shin splints.
Running on soft grass is ideal 
for reducing shock; on the other 
hand, concrete is the worst type 
of running ground as it allows
no bounce back at all for the 
athlete’s foot. Running on a 
treadmill — while clearly not as 
entertaining — is much better for 
an athlete’s body than running 
on a city street, as it does allow 
the foot to bounce back and thus 
weakens the shock to the muscles 
in the lower leg.
Similarly, running shoes are 
designed to absorb shock and 
enable the runner to maintain 
the right posture. Worn-out and 
ill-fitting running shoes do little
to protect the athlete from shin 
splints and other injuries.
Like prevention techniques, the 
signs of a shin splint are univer­
sal. The pain begins slowly in the 
shinbone, and worsens with each 
step of physical exertion. There 
is frequently a tender zone along 
the vertical lining of the shin that 
can be mapped out with the ath­
lete’s fingertips.
The most common treatment 
for shin splints, except the rare 
fractures that require surgery, is
simply rest.' While applying cold 
packs and taking anti-inflamma­
tory medications calm pain and 
inflammation, they cannot cause 
the stress or tear to disappear.
Calf-building exercises also 
help strengthen the muscles, 
which can help them recover.
However, once an athlete 
begins exercising again, the cycle 
restarts. There is no way of tell­
ing if some sudden movement of 
the foot or ankle will cause the 
muscle system to rebel yet again.
How Things Work: Scoreboards
Brandon Sherman/Photo Staff
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
Asst. SciTech Editor
No varsity game is ever com­
plete without the basics: a lit- 
up stadium, exuberant cheer­
leaders, a commentator trying 
very hard to be heard over the 
noise, and of course, the players.
However, it’s hard to forget the 
part of the field that attracts a 
million gazes every few seconds. 
Perhaps the most important 
part of the game should be that 
which decides the final outcome 
of all the adrenaline rush: the 
scoreboard.
Scoreboards have a long his­
tory. As sports games became 
more complicated with more 
rules, the scoreboards had to be 
upgraded to accommodate all of 
the rules.
The most primitive score­
boards have people sitting 
behind them holding cards with 
numbers on them. These are
called mechanical flip score­
boards and have been in use ever 
since sports addicts were born. 
A behind-the-desk official flips 
the scorecards as teams compete 
and scores change.
Technology has come a long 
way since those old days of flip­
ping. and mechanical score­
boards are a thing of the past.
After mechanical flip score­
boards came electro-mechanical 
ones. Digits in these scoreboards 
were not written on placards of 
plastic, but were rather made up 
of light bulbs.
The internal wiring of these 
scoreboards consisted of relay 
switches or stepping switches. 
These switches basically consist 
of coils through which electric­
ity flows, generating a magnetic 
field.
The magnetic field attracts a 
lever, which makes contact with 
different points in the circuit 
and produces different outputs. 
Corresponding to the desired 
digits, different electrical signals 
are sent to the switches generat­
ing different responses.
The main concern with these 
electro-mechanical scoreboards 
is that the light bulbs used in the 
display do not last for very long. 
To make up for this drawback, a 
new generation of scoreboards 
was born in which the light 
bulbs were replaced with Light- 
Emitting Diodes (LEDs).
LED lights may seem like min­
iature light bulbs, but they differ 
greatly from normal incandes­
cent light bulbs in that they do 
not have filaments.
Normal light bulbs have a 
short life mainly because they 
burn out the minute their fila­
ments are damaged. Without 
any filaments, LED lights have 
a rather low chance of burning 
out.
Instead of filaments, LED 
lights consist of semiconductors. 
In LED devices, electrons in the 
semiconductors move through 
specific paths, resulting in the 
emission of light.
LED lights are now fairly com­
mon in most stadiums, but sur­
prisingly, scoreboards consisting 
of old-fashioned incandescent 
light bulbs are still in use.
It is sometimes strange to see 
the use of technology that is con­
sidered somewhat obsolete, but 
the truth is that old-fashioned 
light bulbs are just easier to see. 
In scoreboards that use these 
lights, a change in the angle of 
sunlight or the tilt of an onlook­
er’s head will not alter the way 
the digits appear from far away.
In contrast, because of their 
small size, LED displays are less 
bright and therefore harder to 
see clearly in sunlight. The LED 
lights look best when viewed in 
dim lighting and are therefore 
mostly used by indoor stadiums.
Even after understanding how 
the digits appear on the screens, 
how the boards know what to 
display can still seem mysteri­
ous.
Electromechanical score­
boards are connected to the con­
trol room through extensive wir­
ing running under the stadium. 
Designers developed a smart 
way of doing this in which the 
wires that supplied power to the 
boards were the same wires that 
fed input into the boards.
However, technology has to 
eventually be upgraded as older 
methods prove less efficient, and 
designers eventually scrapped 
the wires althogether. In the 
latest versions of scoreboards, 
infrared signals are sent out to 
the scoreboards and are picked 
up by infrared receptors within 
the boards.
The display is also controlled 
by radio waves, which are trans­
mitted to the board. A new tech­
nology called spread spectrum 
technology allows the signal 
to broadcast over a large radio 
spectrum. This allows the scores 
to be changed more quickly and 
efficiently.
Great effort has been put into 
designing the scoreboards ari’d 
making them work efficiently. 
As the sole element that holds all 
the information that decides the 
fate of a game, scoreboards sure 
do count for a lot.

Kosovo’s independence hinges 
on freedom from oppressionFromTheEditorialBoard
and religious-based genocide provoked 
by the religious differences between the 
Serbians and Albanians, based on most 
Serbians being Orthodox Christians and 
most Albanians being Muslims.
In 1999, the infamous NATO bombing 
of Kosovo followed Albanian Kosovars’ 
persecution by Slobodan Milosevic, 
who sought to cleanse Kosovo of Alba­
nians to create a pure state for Serbians. 
This move, however brutal, seems to 
stand out more in the minds of Alba­
nians than Serbians, who continue to 
emphasize their own past persecutions 
over this modern-day ethnic cleansing.
According to G. Richard Jansen of Col­
orado State University in an essay of Ko­
sovo’s long history, today, the majority of 
Kosovo’s residents are Albanian. Despite 
this, Serbians seem to have little interest 
in populating Kosovo, instead desiring 
to control it from afar. A parliamentary 
republic, Kosovo has been run by the city 
of Belgrade since 1999, but not many 
Serbians have returned to the area.
From the ethnic cleansing of Serbs by 
Albanians in 1912 to the more recent 
ethnic cleansing of Albanians by Serbs 
under Milosevic, the history of Kosovo 
has been a bloody one based on conflict 
and revenge. For this reason, the Feb.
21 Serbian attack on the U.S. embassy 
in Belgrade was way out of line; while 
Serbians may believe “Old Serbia” is 
still rightfully theirs, they are playing a 
game of “who started it first,” focusing 
more on historic conflict than on mak­
ing peace in the present.
Years of hatred need to end some­
where, and the past must become the 
past, not the present. The only way for 
lives to be saved and for people to peace­
fully coexist in the Kosovo region is if 
freedom and independence take hold 
over hate crimes in this contested re­
gion. Even if Albanians have committed 
atrocities against Serbians, both groups 
need to accept Kosovo’s independence 
in order to stabilize their relations.
War will continue to plague them 
both if they continue as one nation. 
Separating from each other is neces­
sary for either side to eventually admit 
to abusing human rights and to forgive 
each other. Regardless of the groups’ 
claims to Kosovo, human rights abuses 
validate any and all claims for indepen­
dence, which should put an end to the 
violent struggle.
History is undeniably important as 
a defining factor in a nation’s identity. 
From understanding a culture’s history, 
it’s possible to learn how that culture 
got where it is today and where it’s go­
ing. But how far back does one have to 
go in a nation’s history in order to vali­
date its present?
Historical issues evolve every day, and 
new problems can emerge at any mo­
ment. Old qualms need to be respected, 
but at what point should we allow the 
problems of the present to override the 
issues of the past? In the case of Kosovo, 
responding to the present is the best way 
to alleviate the problems of the past, and, 
for that reason, Kosovo’s independence 
should be universally acknowledged.
On Feb. 17, Kosovo officially declared 
its independence from Serbia. Following 
the declaration, tens of thousands of Ko­
sovars celebrated their independence in 
the streets of Pristina, the capital. While 
Kosovars were ecstatic, Serbians were 
enraged. To Serbians, who see Kosovo as 
their cultural heartland, Kosovo’s dec­
laration of independence is impetuous 
and unacceptable. Supported by Russia 
and China, Serbia will not acknowledge 
Kosovo as a newborn country but in­
stead as a misbehaving state.
Serbia’s fundamental issue against 
Kosovo’s declaration of independence 
is rooted in its people’s idea of history; 
they see focusing on past conflicts with 
Albanians as more important than fos­
tering change in the present. The story 
of Kosovo itself is long and complicated, 
riddled with many conflicts throughout 
its history.
In the 12th century, Kosovo was the 
administrative and cultural center of 
the Serbian state. This is why Serbi­
ans today refer to Kosovo as the “Old 
Serbia.” However, following a series of 
regional conflicts and a resulting migra­
tion of Serbians out of Kosovo, many Al­
banians entered and resettled the land.
By 1912, Serbians had regained some 
area in parts of Kosovo, although the re­
gion remained dominated by Muslim ide­
als and anti-Christian ethnic-cleansing 
practices, leading Serbians to again leave 
the region and instead populate Serbia.
Over time, Albanians and Serbians 
have engaged in a long cycle of ethnic-

Coffee drinkers don’t want publicity stunts
to which Starbucks is catering. Right 
now, the company’s claim to fame is its 
specialized drink-making abilities and 
the amount of options it offers, yet the 
stores are often based in college towns 
and high-traffic urban locations where 
most people just want a decent cup of 
coffee on the run. Starbucks clearly 
closed its doors in an attempt to impress 
customers, and we think it’s great that 
its competitors were able to capitalize 
on this failed marketing ploy.
Starbucks has realized what its true 
demographic wants and has started of­
fering a $1 cup of coffee with free refills 
at select Seattle locations, as if a rea­
sonably priced cup of coffee is a new­
fangled idea to experiment with. We’re 
happy that Starbucks is coming around, 
but we’re more enthusiastic that other 
coffee companies are putting the heat 
on the industry’s long-time giant.
These companies seem to have a bet­
ter idea of what consumers, including 
us, want — a cheap cup of coffee and de­
pendable store hours, not a barista with 
the ability to memorize strings of adjec­
tives and fill bizarrely specific drink or­
ders within 120 seconds.
The stunt was likely a response to the 
corporation’srecentmacro-management 
change. In January, Starbucks founder 
Howard Schultz returned as CEO to 
bring the company back to its roots — no 
more hot breakfast sandwiches, no more 
extraneous merchandise, just a good 
cup of coffee and the aroma of freshly 
roasted beans that greets customers as 
they walk in the door. While we agree 
with this initiative, we think Starbucks 
should focus on making, rather than 
showing us, the changes.
This extraneous training session 
raises questions as to the demographic
Anyone who walked down Craig 
Street last Tuesday evening was likely 
surprised by the conspicuous closure of 
the street’s cornerstone café. Starbucks 
closed 7100 of its stores from 5:30 to 
8:30 p.m. for a mandatory training ses­
sion for some 135,000 in-store employ­
ees in order to improve the service of the 
company’s baristas.
Taking advantage of Starbucks’ self- 
imposed time off, other coffee chains 
and independent shops offered deals 
for those willing to lure themselves 
away from Starbucks’ locked doors. Cof­
fee Klatch Roasting, a small company 
based in southern California, responded 
by giving away free coffee accompanied 
by a press release reading, “I’m not sure 
why it’s going to take them three hours 
to learn how to press a button,” while 
competing giant Dunkin’ Donuts doled 
out $1 lattes from 1 to 10 p.m.

i i« —r~ T i *¦ i ¦ iLetterToTheEditor
Last week’s Tartan board editorial 
“Materialism should not triumph over 
talent” unfairly criticized this year’s Lu­
nar Gala and offered a skewed assess­
ment of the production.
The article first claims that Lunar 
Gala portrayed women as sexually 
submissive in one of the fashion show’s 
many dance sequences. Whether that is 
in poor taste is a matter of interpreta­
tion; what the article did not mention 
is that in many other sections, men 
took on the submissive role. In Min-jee 
Hwang and Miriam Lee’s conJUNKtion, 
for instance, the final couple to tread 
the runway was a woman fiercely clad 
in black, lording over her heartsick 
suitor.
In fact, the front page of the Feb. 18 
issue of The Tartan featured a full-color 
photo of a coquette leaning powerfully 
over a compliant man on his knees. 
Obviously, dominance and submission 
were cyclical in the show—which is ap­
propriate, considering this year’s theme 
of “Karma.”
Next, the article faulted the show
for being too “banally sexy” and “not 
representing the female population of 
this university, the majority of whom are 
intelligent, working, multi-dimensional 
people....” This statement hinges on 
the idea that sexiness and braininess 
are mutually exclusive, and on behalf 
of all the models who participated in 
this year’s show, I take extreme offense 
at that implication. Most models spent 
off-time during rehearsals with their 
noses buried in books or TI-89s.
And lastly, if The Tartan is so 
scandalized by a little prurience, why 
does the search term “Lunar Gala” on 
www.thetartan.org return photo af­
ter photo of female students in bikinis 
and lingerie, and male students posing 
bare-chested and baby-oiled?
In the future, I hope The Tartan’s edi­
torial board will strive for consistency 
and thoughtful analysis over prudish­
ness and myopia.
Warner Brothers gives credit to the blogosphere
Last week, major news sources, among 
them The New York Times, reported that 
infamous celebrity gossip mini-mogul 
Mario Lavandeira, also known as Perez 
Hilton, may receive his own imprint at 
Warner Brothers Records. This would 
allow him to discover and release artists 
through the label and hold onto a sizable 
chunk of the profits generated. The deal 
was borne of Lavandeira’s seemingly 
uncanny ability to identify new talent: 
The minute Lavandeira raves about a 
group or artist on his blog, downloads of 
that group or artist’s tracks skyrocket, 
often garnering them instant media at­
tention.
Many gossip bloggers see the deal 
as representing not just Lavandeira,
but the significance of the blog as an 
increasingly influential and increas­
ingly credible source of information. 
Blogs have received a bad rap as the 
poor man’s news source, offering un­
censored, unregulated, and sometimes 
untrue content because their authors 
are not full-time reporters and may not 
cite sources and evidence to supplement 
their commentaries the way traditional 
news sources would. But more and 
more, blog authors are experts in their 
fields who strive to provide accurate in­
formation and well-informed opinions, 
and we are glad to see that businesses 
like Warner Brothers have come to ac­
knowledge blogs as powerful tools for 
news and publicity, just like any reliable
media source.
Critics of the negotiations between 
this star blogger and media conglomer­
ate Warner Brothers are concerned that 
the deal may be a publicity stunt on the 
part of Lavandeira, or that Lavandeira’s 
opinions will become skewed. Others 
worry that the line between independent 
and corporate blogs may start to blur. 
But business will always be business, 
and the significance of this proposed 
arrangement lies in its progress for the 
blog, not the man behind it. Should the 
deal go through, Lavenderia may earn 
the respect of the media and the public 
alike for thousands of other bloggers 
like him (most of whom, we hope, go 
lighter on the celebrity trash talk).

Global Seed Vault protects plants, warns of dark future
1022N.C raig2rSt
Last TXiesday, Norway took a 
giant step forward toward forcing 
the world to accept the reality of 
global wanning with its opening 
of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault 
in Longyearbyen.
The vault, essentially a large 
icebox sticking out of a snow-cov­
ered Arctic mountain, can store 
4.5 million seed samples from 
around the world — and shield 
the fruits of the earth from the 
destructive forces of humankind.
Sound a bit intense? It is. Built 
on the Svalbard archipelago, the 
Norwegian vault sits just 600 
miles from the North Pole, tucked 
far away from areas of potential 
warfare or destruction. The nar­
row yet tall concrete form juts 
out of the side of the sandstone 
mountain, which is used to main­
tain a cold temperature for the 
seeds hidden within.
The seeds, themselves com­
partmentalized within stacks of
tiny gray boxes, will hopefully 
act as a backup for plants that 
are currendy endangered or else 
threatened in the future by di- 
mate change, earthquakes, or, 
you know, nuclear war. If the 
world goes into disarray and cer­
tain plants are wiped out, the 
Svalbard vault will serve as a 
bank of sorts from which seeds 
can be removed and replanted.
As Cary Fowler, president of 
the Global Crop Diversity Trust, 
which runs the vault, told the 
International Herald Tribune, “We 
are inside a mountain in the Arctic 
because we wanted a really, really 
safe place that operates by itself.”
The structure is indeed a 
necessity. As explained in a Feb. 
28 Tribune article, “In Norway, 
Global Seed Vault guards genet­
ic resources,” the UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization warns 
that the world has lost three- 
quarters of its crop biodiversity 
in the last century alone. Global 
warming, which — yes — is 
caused by humans, is creating an 
inhospitable environment for the 
survival of our world’s plants.
Such climate change will
necessitate the ability of plants 
to withstand warmer climates, 
which could be challenging due 
to the speed with which global 
warming is setting in and alter­
ing our planet, not giving the 
plants time to adapt. Earthquakes 
and other natural disasters could 
also damage our flora. Moreover, 
if we human beings really can’t 
stand each other and feel the 
power-hungry need to attack each 
other with nuclear and biological 
weapons, innocent plants will be 
among the first to perish.
But what does it say about the 
world that we need to protect 
seeds in this way?
Despite there being similar 
effects to all of these potential 
issues — loss of natural flora, loss 
of subsistence, loss of human life
— I must ask: Since when is an 
earthquake the same thing as a 
nuclear war? There is something 
wrong in the fact that we must 
build a protective vault, hidden 
by the barren landscape of the 
Arctic, as a means of responding 
to our own mistakes.
We can’t control everything, 
although it’s commendable of
Norway to take some proactive 
measures to deal with such issues 
when they occur. But nuclear 
war? We can prevent that.
While only 1.5 million different 
seeds are thought to exist on 
Earth now, the Svalbard vault has 
the potential to house variations 
on those plants and new ones yet 
to exist in the future. But what 
if we are so self-destructive that 
the earth is never even allowed to 
reach that future point?
I am impressed by Norway’s 
initiative to build the vault. It 
is, frankly, quite stately and dra­
matic. The cold, concrete facades 
feature blue and yellow lights and 
an ornamental metallic structure, 
which was incorporated as part 
of the Norwegian mandate that 
1 percent of public building proj­
ects must go toward artwork.
Furthermore, because of 
climate changes worldwide, 
which challenge plants’ survival 
by heightened temperatures, 
heavy rains, and flooding, saving 
what we can of nature is a must.
I am thankful that Norway (and 
the U.K., Australia, Germany, 
and the U.S., which each contrib­
uted $20 million, $12 million, 
$11 million, and $6.5 million, 
respectively) actually did some­
thing about global warming 
instead of just pointing it out 
and not taking any initiatives.
That said, we can’t yet rest 
assured. This vault, while proac­
tive, does not stop global warm­
ing. Instead, it demonstrates 
that we’re increasingly helpless 
against the monsters that are cli­
mate change and violent foreign 
policy — monsters we created. 
Norway should be commended 
for using its natural landscape 
to house Earth’s precious natu­
ral resources.
The general public must see 
that the presence of a need for 
this vault means that environ­
mental irresponsibility is all 
too present and powerful. As a 
united group of people living on 
Earth, we need to get respon­
sible about our planet and own 
up to the way we treat it.

www.croptrust.org.Britney Spears does not qualify as actual news
CeCt*C .SP0
Big things have been 
happening in the world lately — 
Kosovo declared independence, 
Castro resigned, North Korea let 
American news sources into its 
nuclear weapons plant — and 
let’s not forget about domes­
tic issues like the presidential 
race. Although these stories are 
clearly important and deserv­
ing of news coverage, one of 
the biggest stories infiltrating 
mainstream news sources like 
www.cnn.com is the source of 
all things newsworthy, Britney 
Spears, and her visit with her 
kids.
It used to be the case that 
these supposedly formal news 
media sources, like The New York 
Times and CNN, would cover seri­
ous and important stories, and 
that celebrity gossip news was 
limited to being written about 
in celebrity gossip magazines. 
Serious journalism — politics, 
social issues,' and the like — has 
always been separate from the 
gossipy celebrity news version 
of journalism, and that’s a good 
thing.
Now, however, stories like 
Britney Spears’ custody battle 
and Naomi Campbell’s recent 
hospitalization are making front 
page news at sources like www. 
cnn.com. This is an insult to seri­
ous journalists, who write stories 
that actually matter. I don’t care 
whether Britney sees her kids or 
shaves her head, and people who 
do care should be satisfied with 
buying gossip magazines to read 
about it.
The fact that Britney Spears 
visited her kids is not really 
news, and neither is the cus­
tody battle she went through. 
Parents around the country and 
the world go through the same 
thing that she’s going through, 
and they certainly do not make 
the front page of a popular and 
respected news website. Frankly, 
who cares about Britney? She’s
not more important or worse 
off than any other parent bat­
tling to see their kids, except 
that Britney’s highs and lows 
(especially lows) are caught on 
tape; Britney was filmed in May 
2006 dropping her son, a pretty 
clear sign that she’s fighting a 
losing battle.
A search for “Britney Spears” 
on www.cnn.com yields over
300 results. While searching for 
Obama gives over 800 results 
by comparison, 300 is a number 
far too high for someone with 
no importance or significance to 
real news.
Additionally, on CNN’s web­
site there’s a section called 
“Hot Topics,” and within that 
section, there’s a list of sup­
posedly important individuals 
and groups of people. George 
W. Bush makes the cut, along 
with al Qaeda, Paris Hilton, and 
Britney Spears.
Something about that list is 
disturbing. Suddenly, being an 
ex-teen idol or a ditzy blond 
heiress is just as important in the 
realm of serious news as are al 
Qaeda and the president , of the 
United States.
Serious news sources need to 
be just that — serious. Celebrity 
news should be pushed back 
to the entertainment section 
instead of dominating the front 
page, or simply left out of the 
publication altogether. The 
future of journalism looks bleak 
if this is where news is head­
ed. Instead of promoting issues 
that matter, like the presiden­
tial race that determines who 
runs our country for the next 
four years, or raising awareness 
about important domestic and 
international news, journalists 
are wasting their time — and 
that of their readers — by writ­
ing about celebrities.
It isn’t all the fault of the pub­
lications, though. People are 
demanding more news about 
celebrities, and news publica­
tions want to increase their read­
erships, so they give their read­
ers what they want. As a result, 
most people can’t talk about 
current events without fumbling
over the details, but they can tell 
you which party Lindsay Lohan 
attended and what happened 
when Britney Spears visited her 
kids. Readers should expect to 
see real news, and not pop cul­
ture news, in these publications, 
and until they do, news websites 
will be unwilling to change their 
ways for fear of losing their read­
erships.
Online publications are becom­
ing more popular and more 
widely read than print editions 
due to their ease of accessing 
the latest news. Since these web­
sites are connected to legitimate 
news sources, the content should 
reflect this. The extra power 
and influence that comes with 
being a popular and respected 
news source also comes with the 
responsibility to inform readers 
about the issues that matter — 
and that doesn’t include Britney 
Spears.
Besides giving American 
readers more interesting and
important things to read, online 
news publications should real­
ize that they have an interna­
tional audience as well. When 
Britney Spears is one of the 
hot topics on the front page, 
she is representing our country, 
making us appear more inter­
ested in trivial pop culture mat­
ters than issues of politics or 
culture. That’s something we 
definitely don’t want to encour­
age.
Britney Spears should not be 
a symbol of anyone’s country (or 
anything else, for that matter). 
She can’t keep her life together, 
and she is not a role model. If 
news sources insist upon putting 
celebrities in the mainstream 
news, then they should choose 
their subjects wisely. Celebrities 
can be role models, and if a 
celebrity must be a hot topic in 
the news, it can at the very least 
be someone worth reading about. 
A celebrity’s work is only impor­
tant and worth reporting on if
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
it relates to another important 
issue, as in the case of endors­
ing political candidates or pro­
moting a charitable cause, such 
as actress Angelina Jolie’s work 
with refugees.
News sources — both online 
and in print — need to get 
back to writing about things 
that affect wider audiences 
and use their power to inform 
the people about more than 
just gossip. Journalists should 
report the news and return to 
making their profession a seri­
ous one, and leave Us Weekly 
and Star to deal with Britney’s 
visit to her kids and Paris 
Hilton’s latest drunken mis­
take. There is a place for these 
kinds of stories, but that place 
isn’t CNN.

Communication 
on campus: 
Newswire and 
cmuTV__________
2sbu hs,u53v:w m Cl, 1b,u
Hey Tartans,
This week, I have a pretty in­
teresting initiative to share with 
you that has the potential to re­
shape the way organizations on 
our campus communicate with 
both each other and the general 
student body.
This initiative comes in the 
form of a web application de­
veloped by Perry Servedio, a 
friend of ours who served as last 
year’s public relations chairman 
on Pitt’s Student Government 
Board. He noticed that there was 
a problem in the way student 
groups at Pitt communicated 
event information and other an­
nouncements: Lots of valuable 
information was getting lost in 
the communication grapevine, 
which left a lot of students un­
informed about campus events. 
Recognizing the Internet to be 
a powerful tool for communica­
tion, Perry constructed the Uni­
versity Press Release Newswire.
The newswire enables student 
organizations to post a summary 
of important events that they 
have scheduled. This informa­
tion is then conveyed to subscrib­
ers of that organization’s news­
wire. That way, the organization 
can target specific people, and 
students are not overloaded with 
information they don’t want.
Our student government is 
currently in the formative stages 
of adopting our own newswire. 
We’ll be the second school to use 
it and hopefully one of the pio­
neers in implementing new com­
munication methods on college 
campuses. The campus should 
see the newswire in full swing 
around the middle of next year, 
as we’re currently working on 
adapting it to fit for our campus’s 
needs.
Beyond that, these final weeks 
of our term seem to have Adi and 
myself working on more long­
term projects. These include 
building up cmuTV by giving the 
organization a studio of its own 
so that it can produce new con­
tent without having to struggle 
through hours of unnecessary 
labor for every minute of content 
produced. We feel that cmuTV 
could be a central source of infor­
mation for the Carnegie Mellon 
community if it is able to follow 
a proper developmental path. As 
infrastructure is currently the 
biggest obstacle, we aim to al­
leviate that problem. Of course, 
one of the bigger challenges that 
our campus organizations face 
is a lack of space, so the process 
may not be an easy one.
Hopefully, this column has 
kept you up to date with every­
thing coming out of our student 
government this year. As usual, 
if you’d like to know anything, 
contribute any knowledge you 
think we’re lacking, or just chat, 
e-mail us at cmu5@cmu.edu.
It’s the time in the semester when classes get tough and midterms take over. So we asked,

eight, and junior guard Colleen 
Light tallied eight to go with her 
team-high three assists. Junior 
forward Julie Marriott led Roch­
ester with 15 points and seven 
rebounds. Baroody chipped in 12 
points toward her team’s win.
The Tartans fought hard 
throughout the entire game, and 
the same can be said for their en­
tire season. The team is graduat­
ing only one senior, Feola.
Feola has ended the season 
first among the Tartans in field 
goal attempts, at 10.3 a game,
and second in both field goal per­
centage and field goals made, at 
0.377 percent and 3.9 per game, 
respectively.
She was also second behind 
Aleski in points per game. Be­
sides points per game, Aleski 
also led the Tartans in free 
throws, steals, and field goal 
percentage. Junior forward Jea­
nette Schilling led the team in 
free throw percentage, while 
Roll dominated in rebounds and 
assists.
The Tartans finished the season 
with a record of 7-18 overall and 
0-14 in the University Athletic 
Association.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Is Tiger Woods the greatest athlete of all time?
SHAFIQUE RASHID
Let’s be honest, Tiger Woods 
is old news. Ever since he picked 
up a club at the age of two, the 
former child prodigy seemed 
destined for greatness. And 
since he broke onto the Profes­
sional Golf Association (PGA) 
tour in 1996, we have constantly 
been reminded that Woods is 
hot stuff while watching him in 
television commercial endorse- 
‘ments for Buick and Nike or his 
most recent mind-boggling shot 
on ESPN’s SportsCenter.
But after having won eight of 
his last nine tournaments, and 
after talks of an unprecedented 
perfect year surfaced, rum­
blings in the sports world have 
been of a different tone. Sports 
analysts are beginning to pos­
tulate that Tiger Woods may not 
only be the best to play the sport 
of golf, but that he may be the 
greatest, most dominant athlete 
of all time.
Now, the historically con­
scious sports fan does not easily 
accept statements of this na­
ture. When you say “the great­
est athlete of all time,” it evokes 
images of Michael Jordan, Mu­
hammad Ali, and, if you are 
especially conscious, Wayne 
Gretzky. You also need not for­
get a current tennis player by 
the name Roger Federer. Are we 
expected to believe that a golfer 
has surpassed all of these ath­
letes in greatness?
It's hard to follow along with 
this recent movement, and many 
probably prefer to denounce 
it as just another example of 
present-day bias in the sport­
ing world. After all, it wouldn’t 
be the first time sports media 
has fallen into such a pitfall; all 
you have to do is ask New York 
Giants quarterback Eli Man­
ning (or Bill Belichick, the head 
coach for the New England Pa­
triots, for that matter), just how 
quickly public perception can 
be swayed.
It doesn’t take much research 
to realize, however, that this is 
not the case when it comes to 
Tiger Woods. Greatness aside, 
Woods may be the smartest 
athlete of all time. More than 
once, he sacrificed current per­
formance in order to improve 
his technique, as he knew it 
would allow him to be a better 
player in the long run. He en­
dured periods outsiders termed
as slumps to improve his swing, 
allowing him to come back 
stronger than ever.
Woods has the lowest scoring 
average of any player (a good 
thing in golO, and has more 
PGA tour and major wins (54 
and 12, respectively) in his first
11 years', than any golfer in any 
11-year span, ever. Sounds a lit­
tle like Federer over the past five 
years, doesn’t it? And reminis­
cent of Jordan and Ali, Woods 
has a ferocious killer instinct 
while in action, center stage. So 
hey, it’s okay to take your time 
with reaching perfection when 
you are already setting records 
at a pace unprecedented by your 
sport.
Undefeated and in the lead 
going into the final round, 
Woods has joined MJ as the 
greatest closer in the history of 
sports.
Woods is the only golfer ever 
to win all four majors consecu­
tively, and he seems poised to 
easily surpass Jack Nicklaus’ re­
cord of 18 majors. The scariest 
part is that Woods is now say­
ing his swing is better than ever 
before. It seems that Woods is 
only now beginning to peak as a 
player, with no end to his prime
in sight.
By the end of his career, Tiger 
Woods should have surpassed 
every golf record to the point of 
shrouding all his predecessors 
in obscurity, similar to the way 
Wayne Gretzky put up untouch­
able records in hockey. But un­
like Gretzky, Woods was able 
to popularize his sport with his 
transcendental personality. He 
showed people that golf is not a 
sport limited to old, white men. 
And Woods’ ability to effectively 
market himself, much in the 
way that Jordan did, has him on 
track to become the world’s first 
billion-dollar athlete.
It’s extremely hard not to 
buy into the greatness of Tiger 
Woods. Is he the greatest ath­
lete of all time? He sure seems 
like a manifestation of the qual­
ities of past sports greats. Once 
he surpasses Nicklaus’ record of 
18 majors, it will be difficult to 
argue that he is not, unequivo­
cally, the most dominant athlete 
in history. Golf fans are being 
treated to a once-in-a-lifetime 
individual. Soon it will be in­
correct to call him the Michael 
Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, or Mu­
hammad Ali of golf. He will sim­
ply be known as the greatest.
Men’s basketball falls to Rochester 74-76 Saturday
e0ty from page A12
Gonzalez hit a clutch three- 
pointer with just over three 
minutes left to tie the game at 
65. However, the Tartans were 
unable to convert any of their 
open looks down the stretch, and 
Rochester finished with a 9-0 
run. The final score indicated a 
seven-point victory for the Yellow 
Jackets.
“This was a game we could’ve
had,” said Kozak. “There were 
just a few plays down the stretch 
we could point to that made the 
difference.”
Putting wins and losses aside, 
however, it is important to recog­
nize the two graduating seniors. 
In the four years since they ar­
rived, the Tartans have earned a 
UAA championship, a runner-up 
in the UAA, an NCAA tourna­
ment berth, and two ECAC tour­
nament bids. In all likelihood,
their third ECAC bid will come 
today.
“I was talking with coach about 
it, and he asked me what it was 
like not to play in the postsea­
son,” Gonzalez said. Gonzalez, 
in his fifth year after a medical 
redshirt, was part of the team in 
2003-2004 when it did not qual­
ify for postseason play. “Quite 
frankly, I told him it sucks. It’s no 
good to sit at home in March and 
watch all the other teams com­
pete for something significant.”
The Tartans find out their 
postseason fate later today, 
when seedings are announced 
for both the ECAC and NCAA 
tournaments.
If Carnegie Mellon receives 
a spot, it will be four years and 
four postseason bids for the two 
Tartan seniors, including one 
UAA championship and a trip to 
the NCAA tournament two years 
ago.
Junior Ryan Einwag (#10) goes for the hoop with senior Greg Gonzalez (#34) supporting.

With the end of the indoor 
season rapidly approaching, 
junior distance runner Brian 
Harvey has collected UAA 
Men’s Track and Field Athlete 
of the Week honors and set 
two school records, one in the 
5000-meter run and one in the 
mile event.
Having qualified for 
both the UAA and NCAA 
competitions that are coming 
up, Harvey took some time out 
to talk with The Tartan about 
the relationship between his 
running lifestyle and life as a 
Carnegie Mellon student.
Tartan: Do you have any 
goals with UAAs right around 
the comer? What about for the 
outdoor season?
Harvey: While winning 
the team title is always the 
ultimate goal going into any 
conference championship, the 
most important thing about 
indoor is that we are able to 
use it as stepping stone that we 
can build on for outdoor.
Capturing the team 
conference title last outdoor 
season was easily the most 
thrilling athletic accomplish­
ment I’ve ever been a part 
of, and we want more than 
anything to experience that 
feeling again this year.
The race I am most excited 
about for the upcoming cham­
pionships is the distance med­
ley relay.
Due to a couple guys making 
huge improvement over the 
last few weeks of the season, 
our team not only has a shot 
at winning the race and set­
ting a school and conference 
record, but also qualifying for 
nationals.
T: How is high school 
competition different than 
that in college?
H: My success in high 
school, like many, was almost 
completely based on natural 
ability. I only ran maybe 30 
to 40 miles a week and never 
more than six times a week.
When I got to college, I was 
shocked to learn people ran 
upwards of 100 miles or more 
a week. Now I average double 
the mileage I was doing in 
high school.
T: What is the best way to 
prepare for a race?
H: The personality that 
tends to be interested in 
running is meticulous and de­
tail-oriented since running is 
more of lifestyle than a sport.
I am almost always thinking 
about the food I need to eat 
and the amount of sleep I need 
to perform at my best.
Nearly every runner adopts 
a couple of silly rituals they 
always must do the night be­
fore or day of a race.
The main one I have is I 
must take a shower the morn­
ing of a race despite the fact 
that I will just get sweaty and 
gross a couple hours later.
T: Do you have a preference 
for cross country or track and 
field?
H: My original interest 
in cross country back in my 
freshman year of high school 
was purely social and was 
actually a backup after I was 
cut from the soccer team.
I prefer cross country over 
track because, while the entire 
track and field [team] tends
to get along and are friends, 
[the experience] pales in 
comparison to the bond 
between the seven guys on the 
cross country team that push 
each other towards the same 
goal.
T: Do Carnegie Mellon and 
the Pittsburgh area provide 
nice landscapes to run?
H: We could not ask for 
better places to run than 
Schenley and Frick Park. 
Their soft surfaces significantly 
reduce the risk of injury, and 
they are big enough that I can 
run in them every day and 
never get sick of them.
I am always reminded how 
fortunate we are to have these 
parks when they freeze over in 
the winter and we are forced 
to do all our mileage on the 
roads.
One of my favorite races 
every season is our home cross 
country invitation we hold in 
Schenley Park, where many 
alumni come back and race 
and tons of friends and family 
come out to support.
T: With a heavy workload at 
Carnegie Mellon, do yo^i find 
that participating in a sport 
keeps you organized?
H: I honesdy can’t imagine 
life without running every day. 
It provides a much-needed 
break between classes and 
homework every day. Without 
running, the workload might 
have driven me insane.
T: Are you excited to watch 
the Olympics this summer?
H: A few months ago, my 
friend and I made the rash 
decision that we were going 
to go watch the Olympics in 
Beijing this summer, no matter 
what it took.
We actually went through 
a good bit of planning, knew 
exactly which races we wanted 
to see, flight options, and what 
hotels we could stay at.
It was at this point that we 
realized we were poor college 
students and we could unfor­
tunately never afford such an 
extravagant vacation, so I’ll be 
watching from my couch with 
my teammates.
T: Where is your favorite 
place to eat?
H: Honestly, I avoid eating 
on campus at all costs. I usu­
ally bring my lunch to school 
and then cook for myself at 
nigh't.
With the volume of running 
that I do, the services on cam­
pus just do not cut it. Since I 
moved off campus after my 
freshman year, I have learned 
to love cooking and enjoy pre­
paring and especially eating 
delicious meals.
T: What interests you most 
about your major and the 
classes you are taking?
H: This semester, I am 
working 10 hours a week at the 
Human Engineering Research 
Lab on a large-scale project 
integrating two robotic arms 
with an electric wheelchair 
for people with limited upper- 
limb function.
The ultimate goal of the 
project is to attach several 
sensors to the wheelchair that 
will allow the wheelchair and 
robotic arms to work together 
autonomously to, for example, 
open a door with very limited 
input from the user.
Pretty much, it’s going to be 
one pimped-out wheelchair.

Junior Staffwriter
Six Carnegie Mellon scholar 
athletes received both academic 
and athletic honors this week. 
Junior track and field runner 
Brian Harvey, and two tennis 
players, senior Amy Staloch and 
first-year Jennifer Chui, received 
the title of the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Athlete of the 
Week. In addition, junior Carolyn
Clayton, senior Geoff Misek, first- 
year J.P. Allera, and Harvey were 
all named to the U.S. Track and 
Field and Cross Country Coaches 
Association All-Academic Team 
(USTFCCA).
Harvey was named Men’s In­
door Track and Field UAA Athlete 
of the Week for his success at the 
Kent State University Tune-Up 
on Saturday, Feb. 23. With a sec­
ond place finish in the 5000-me­
ter, Harvey recorded a time of
14:43.94. Harvey’s time was not 
only his second NCAA Division
III provisional qualifying time 
this season, but also a new school 
record. This is his third record 
of the season, following times in 
the 1,500-meter and one-mile 
events.
Staloch and Chui were named 
Women’s Tennis UAA Athletes of 
the Weekbased on their combined 
and individual performances at 
Kenyon College on Saturday, Feb.
23. The talented duo posted an
8-0 victory over Kenyon in first 
doubles, which puts the players 
at 12-2 for the season. Staloch 
and Chui also had individual suc­
cesses, with Staloch posting a 
6-0, 6-2 victory in first singles 
and Chui scoring 6-3, 6-2 in sec­
ond singles.

The Carnegie Mellon Univer­
sity women’s basketball team 
ended its season with a close loss 
to the University of Rochester 
Yellow Jackets, 49-55, last Sat­
urday.
The Tartans started the game 
sharp from behind the arc, as 
junior point guards Stacie Aleski 
and Corey Innes and senior for­
ward Leah Feola all connected on 
their three-pointer attempts. The 
Tartans led 14-10 at 9:53, but the 
Yellow Jackets reeled off nine 
straight points over the next five 
minutes to take the lead 19-14. 
At halftime, the score was 26-20 
in favor of Rochester, with both 
teams playing solid defense and 
almost matching each other on 
the offensive end as well.
In the second half, the Tartans 
came out strong. They applied 
greater pressure on defense and 
moved the ball more effectively 
on offense, also grabbing several 
impressive offensive rebounds.

It was an emotional afternoon 
for Greg Gonzalez and Geoff Ko­
zak as they finished out their reg- 
ular-season careers against the 
University of Rochester Yellow 
Jackets in Skibo Gymnasium.
The team finished the sea­
son with a record of 6-8 in the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) and 16-9 overall. The two 
seniors put forth their best per­
formances, including a few clutch 
plays, in the hopes of knock­
ing off another UAA conference 
opponent and propelling their 
postseason hopes forward.
Unfortunately for the Tartans, 
the efforts weren’t quite enough 
to finish the 15th-ranked Yellow 
Jackets, who won 74-67 in the 
game’s closing moments.
“It’s tough to end things like 
that,” said Gonzalez, who scored 
in double figures for the 19th 
time this season. “You always 
dream about ending your career 
with a victory. Unfortunately, 
we just couldn’t make enough 
plays down the stretch to bring
it home.”
The home game for Carnegie 
Mellon was hard fought, to say 
the least. From the opening mo­
ments, the tone was set by the 
big men inside to be a tough, 
physical game. Tartans junior 
Terrance Bouldin-Johnson and 
Gonzalez did their best to bang 
inside with Rochester’s monster 
forwards, Uche Ndubizu and Jon 
Onyiriuka.
“That was my main thing com­
ing out,” said Bouldin-Johnson, 
who played despite injuring a 
ligament in his thumb the night 
before. “I wasn’t worried about 
scoring as much as I was worried

Unique spring break ideas Everything you need to know
Travel plans for a memorable week off • About winter cravings and backstabbers
Spring break is coming up, and even though some 
people have had their plans decided for months, 
others are still unsure about what they're doing — or 
whether they’re going anywhere at all. For anyone 
that falls into the latter group, read on to find some 
unique and exciting ideas that definitely beat going 
home or staying on campus.
The service break
While some people are interested in partying on a 
beach, there are plenty of students who would rather 
do something more worthwhile with their time. For 
these people, service trips are a fantastic way to 
spend spring break.
The ideal service break varies by student and by 
interest, and finding the best option can be as 
easy as tracking down the most appealing charity. 
Some options don’t even require distant travel
— find out whether a local Habitat for Humanity 
chapter is having a build day during spring break, 
or gather a group of friends to participate in the 
Collegiate Challenge, a week-long build event for 
groups of five or more. The cost will be cheaper 
than flying to Cancún, and, if you’re not into the 
party-on-the-beach scene, the experience will be 
more enjoyable and definitely more worthwhile.
Already have a passport and looking for something 
international? Try going to Costa Rica or Honduras 
to build homes for the needy, or maybe travel to 
Kenya or Uganda to help the environment and local 
wildlife. Whatever your interests, there are options 
available worldwide for charity during spring break. 
These options may be a bit more pricey, but a 
chance to work with the wildlife in Africa is certainly 
memorable.
The cultural break
Not interested in service or partying? Try a cultural 
vacation. These trips can vary depending on what 
part of culture or the world seems most interesting. 
Within the United States, there are museums and 
performances scattered across the country.
For example, if .modern art interests you more than 
¦ pop culture, try heading to New York to visit the 
Guggenheim; if the West Coast is more your style, 
visit the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. For 
some, pop culture is more exciting than art, and 
exhibits like "White Canvas,” which is on display at
the Guggenheim, don’t really make sense; if you’re 
one of those people, maybe you can try to head to 
Austin, Texas to visit the South Austin Museum 
of Popular Culture. Or, for those who like all sorts 
of culture, try heading to Washington, D.C. — the 
city has a Smithsonian for almost every aspect 
of culture, and you’re bound to find something 
interesting in at least one of them.
If an international vacation is more appealing, try 
somewhere new, and not an old standby. Sure, 
London and Paris are exciting, but why not visit 
St. Petersburg (the Hermitage Museum is full of 
great European art) or Tokyo — a cultural vacation 
doesn’t have to consist only of visiting museums, 
and cities like Tokyo are full of unique culture. Try 
something new — like new food or even a new 
interest (karaoke, anyone?) to make spring break 
exciting and memorable.
The travel break
Even if you don’t want to go to a beach full of 
students on break, traveling for no purpose other 
than the travel itself can provide a fantastic and 
much-needed break from university life, and many 
of these options are safer and more enjoyable than 
party hot spots like Cancún.
For a different sort of vacation, try going on a 
cruise. This can provide a fun, relaxing experience, 
as well as the chance to visit other countries.
There are different kinds of cruises to suit different 
personalities and interests.
For example, a European cruise will stop in various 
European countries, offering a different kind of 
European vacation, and a Caribbean cruise will 
stop at an island, offering a beach vacation that 
isn’t quite like the traditional spring break trip.
Not interested in a cruise? Try going to the 
mountains for skiing or hiking, or stay in a cabin 
by a lake fof some quiet relaxation. Other options 
include visiting landmarks like the Grand Canyon, 
or maybe a national park. The opportunities for 
unique and interesting travel are plentiful, and 
there’s sure to be at least one appealing vacation 
for every student.

Dear Rachael,
I’ve been super anti-social lately, 
it’s not because I’m depressed; 
it’s just because I always choose 
the wrong people to hang out 
with and they always wind up 
stabbing me in the back later. I 
really enjoy my alone time, but 
I’m afraid I might be using it as 
an escape. How can I find better 
people to spend time with who 
won’t turn me into a nut job like 
all my other “friends” have?
—Socially cocooned
Dear me,
I mean, dear you. I feel for you 
dahling! But really, overall, I think 
it’s best to not settle for friends, 
especially if you think you’ll be 
disappointed. It’s just like significant 
others — think about it.
Look for friends that make you feel 
good, and that you feel good around. 
They could be closer than you think, 
waiting for the backstabbers to 
scatter like roaches being attacked 
by super-strength Raid. These 
people could be at your favorite 
lounge spots, your classes, in the. 
UC by the black chairs watching 
the muted TV at 3 a.m. — the 
possibilities are limitless.
And if, at any point, these people 
start making you feel like a worthless 
pile of manure, keep them at bay and 
start your search again. Besides, it 
takes a really mature and self-aware 
person to be able to have their alone 
time without going wonky about it, 
so feel free to keep doing that, as 
long as you hang out with some of 
your prospective friends too.
So long to the solo,
Rachael
Dear Rachael,
I’m a pretty curvy-style weight; 
I’m not unhealthy, but I’m no 
size two. I’ve discovered a 
pattern in my eating habits: 
I always eat more during the 
winter (especially January and 
February) and less during the 
summer. I don’t want to be 
a seasonal weight yo-yo-er 
though! Any pointers for curbing 
my “I need dessert” cravings 
during winter the way I can 
during summer?
—Cravin’ like a Raven
Hello, Little Birdie,
First of all, it’s great that you realize 
that anything over a size two is not 
unhealthy. I like you! I think it’s kind 
of natural to eat more when it’s cold 
outside, especially in Pittsburgh — 
who doesn’t need a distraction from 
the lousy-every-other-day weather?
Maybe it’s not so much that you 
eat more, but what you eat. Instead 
of picking up that delicious scone 
or muffin or cookie, get on that 
delicious stick of celery instead! 
Unfortunately, most delicious fruits 
are only around during the summer 
(when you don’t even eat as much) 
but you can still get your vegetable 
on with salads or something.
And then when summer cdmes 
back along, keep yourself on track. 
If you have a blender, you should 
make smoothies because they are 
really delicious and totally healthy.
I mean, they are made up of fruits 
and calcium. Seriously.
Good luck on your ¿rack to 
deliciousness,
Rachael

outfit neutral and solid, Kong easily pulls off the look. Kong’s 
oatmeal-colored scarf with specks of gray also works well to 
complement her skin tone against her jacket.
The minute details of Kong’s outfit are what make her stand 
out. The buttons on her bag nicely accompany the buttons on 
her coat. The simple, subtle textures on her scarf, coat, and 
boots all blend together, creating a posh, polished look that 
shows off an intricacy to detail without compromising grace 
and luxury.
Kerr’s style combines preppy elements with a well-done 
rugged edge. "My old roommate used to design for Penguin,” 
he said, regarding his style inspirations; around since 1955, 
Original Penguin brand shows up in stores from Urban 
Outfitters to Barneys New York. Kerr’s bright orange V-neck 
sweater peeks out from his unbuttoned fitted pea coat, 
drawing attention to the upper part of his body. The wide 
jacket collar emphasizes Kerr’s face, and looks both chic and 
easy to wear. Furthermore, Kerr’s thick knit scarf brings the 
right amount of contrast, toning the sweater down and adding 
another texture at the same time..
This spring’s runway shows by designers like Dior Homme 
emphasized slimming looks for men. This doesn’t necessary 
call for tight pieces, but rather clothes that fit just right
Fundamentals of modern style
With the much-anticipated spring break right around the 
comer, it’s no surprise that students are starting to dress in 
anticipation of the weather ahead. Ingrid Kong, a sophomore 
architecture major, starts off the upcoming season with one 
great accessory — her bag. However, students aren’t the only 
fashionable part of campus — biomedical engineering staff 
member Brendan Kerr shows off his optimism for springtime 
as well.
"I love layering," Kong said, and it is definitely apparent in 
her outfit. Her style reflects a notable ability to work with 
contrasts. She begins with a classic winter look: a long, 
lean-cut black pea coat that hits at her knees. Extra details, 
like the button tabs on the sleeves, update and separate an 
otherwise basic jacket. Barely peeking through her coat, Kong 
also wears dark skinny jeans, tucked into brown suede knee 
boots. Though the jeans and boots combination is essential 
in winter, she uses traditionally opposite colors, pairing them 
together to give her look an extra raw dimension.
The strongest element of Kong's outfit is her bag; the color, 
bright yellow with green undertones, was huge on the 
runways this spring. Additionally, the structured bag made 
a great comeback this season, with redefined shapes and 
sly simplicity. Such a bright color is sometimes hard to pull 
off, even in suitable weather. But by keeping the rest of her

to allow for movement without looking messy. Kerr’s 
straight-legged jeans are a great example of how to look 
pulled-together without too much effort. His jeans are creased 
right at the front pockets, while the rest looks almost ironed. 
The jeans are also the perfect length, and the overall look 
gives Kerr a defined, modern masculinity. Arguably the 
sleekest part of his outfit is his shoes,"brown leather square- 
toed oxfords that have the perfect worn-in look to them.
Kerr’s style is sharp and fresh; by dressing to flatter his body, 
he redefines classic to be fun and easy-going, while still 
looking professional. With men’s style, streamlining an entire 
look is important, especially in professional settings — avoid 
unnecessary, extravagant details, and pay attention to the 
overall framework. The body serves as the palette, and men 
should always dress to flatter it in the best way possible.
Using splashes of color makes for whimsical style, and paired 
with slim, structured pieces, any outfit can instantly look 
flawless and refined.

The Glass Cube
On vocals and character
Last week, Alexander Smith discussed preference of vocals, suggesting 
that, “listeners prefer vocalists of the gender they want to sleep with.” 
Perhaps this has merit — I do, in fact, own many more songs sung 
by highly emotional men, from Joy Division’s Ian Curtis to TV on the 
Radio’s Tunde Adebumpe, than I do from women.
But really, like.Smith hopes, it is more than just a vocalist’s gender that 
makes or breaks a song for me — soul, realism, authenticity, sincerity, 
and passion are all key factors, to name a few. Whatever you'd like 
to call it, it’s that X-factor that puts the human back into the song. 
It's not the gender, race, or age of vocalists that turns me on; it’s the 
personalities they manage to convey through their singing styles and 
the tones of their voices.
How can one sense an authentic personality through vocal delivery, 
though? Beats me. How do you know if you're in love? You could 
probably break it down scientifically into the speed of your heart or 
dilation of your pupils, but that dissection of something so human 
takes the joy out of it.
As Smith mentioned, there are many “love it or hate it" vocalists out 
there. I hate Kate Bush, for one. Her shrill, warbly vocals, to me, are 
not only aurally displeasing, but emotionally irritating, too. Through 
her songs, I get the sense that her character is far too dramatic, 
pretentiously artsy, and overall just too much for me. On the other 
hand, Bjork’s vocals are just as dramatic (if not more so) and yet seem 
stronger, sturdier, and more confident than Bush’s. Bjork is a woman 
who knows what she wants and says what she means — even if it is 
in broken English. I appreciate those qualities in a vocalist as I do in 
a friend, and I am thus a fan of her vocals. I don’t particularly want to 
sleep with either one of these women, but I can see why their vocals 
. might appeal to people.
Perhaps the personality in vocals is the problem I, and many others, 
have with a lot of pop music. The singer, in these cases, is not a part 
of the heart of the song, but instead another glossy pitch-perfect 
instrument. Much of the time, I don’t get the impression that, upon 
meeting these pop singers, I would be at all inclined to get to know 
them. I’ll admit, though, that I’ve fallen prey to such great pop songs 
like Rihanna's “Umbrella,” Cassie's “Me & U,” and the entirety of Justin 
Timberlake’s album FutureSex/LoveSounds. To me, all of these singers 
manage to elevate the mechanized beats with some sort of genuine 
emotion in their voices. In “LoveStoned," Justin just sounds so damn 
serious that he truly lives up to the song’s name, although perhaps 
that’s just because I wouldn't mind sleeping with him.

Students discuss transgender issues
Toilet Training sparks discussion and debate
The screening was followed by a discussion, part 
of which invited attendees to relate their personal 
accounts of problems in restrooms. The discussion 
focused on finding a solution that would allow 
transgender and cisgender (or non-transgender) 
individuals alike to feel safe and comfortable in 
restrooms.
Attendees discussed topics such as why bathrooms 
are gender-specific in the first place, in addition to the 
installation of more unisex bathrooms. The discussion 
also included debate about sexual assault and the 
possible implications of unisex bathrooms.
“Cisgender women and trans women both experience 
oppression that is rooted in sexism — they need to 
work together to address the real threats to women’s 
safety, which doesn’t come from [transgender] 
people," said Noah Lewis, organizer and facilitator of 
this event in addition to weekly Transgender Study 
Group meetings.
"First, they need to educate everyone on campus 
not to harass people or question their right to be 
in a particular bathroom. Second, there need to be 
gender-neutral bathrooms located in every building,” 
Lewis said.
Tyler Moss, president of ALLIES, Carnegie Mellon's 
GLBTQA organization, agreed. “You really do need 
more unisex bathrooms in academic buildings,” Moss 
sâid.
Carnegie Mellon currently has approximately 15 
unisex bathrooms on campus in various locations, 
including two in the University Center.
For most students, choosing which bathroom to 
use is effortless. Illustrations or words on the door 
make it clear if a student should use the “Men’s” or 
“Women’s” room. These binary gender classifications, * 
however, create problems for transgender students. 
Transgender people are those whose biological 
sex is not aligned with the gender they identify as. 
Transgender individuals often present themselves 
as their gender rather than their sex. In doing so, 
they face danger in choosing a bathroom: They are 
forced to either use a bathroom contrasting with 
their identity and perceived gender or to risk being 
harassed or stigmatized for using a bathroom of the 
wrong sex.
Last Wednesday, the Transgender Study Group, 
along with the Rainbow Alliance, the University of 
Pittsburgh's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, 
Queer, and Allied (GLBTQA) organization, showed 
Toilet Training, a documentary intended to raise 
awareness about transgender restroom choice 
problems.
The documentary discussed a vast array of issues 
faced by transgender individuals in using public 
restrooms, as well as relating the issue to topics such 
as race, employment discrimination, health concerns, 
and worries specific to students. The film included 
interviews from several transgender individuals 
who spoke about their troubles in finding unisex 
bathrooms or other safe, comfortable bathrooms to 
use. Additionally, the documentary illustrated cases 
of gender non-conforming individuals being harassed 
and arrested in bathrooms, which happens frequently 
even when an individual's presence in the bathroom 
is entirely legal.
Anti-discrimination laws protect against 
discrimination on the basis of gender identity in only 
four states, Pennsylvania not included. There aie, 
however, anti-discrimination laws in Pittsburgh that 
protect the choice of transgender individuals to use 
the restroom in which they feel most comfortable, 
offering legal (but not social) protection. As evident 
in both the documentary and subsequent discussion, 
discrimination still occurs despite these laws.
“An employer has an obligation to provide a 
comfortable, safe, harassment-free workplace for 
everybody, including the [transgender] person in the 
workforce,” said Hugh McGough, a labor employment 
attorney present at the documentary screening and 
discussion.
Bathroom use is just one of many issues that 
transgender students face, and according to Moss, 
ALLIES is helping to address transgender students’ 
needs.
Advocates for the transgender population hope that 
the future will include comfortable bathrooms for all 
individuals.
"It's the responsibility of everyone to advocate for 
equal access to bathrooms, not just [transgender] 
people," Lewis said.

Penelope: Not your average fairy-tale
Christina Ricci’s new film offers snorts, giggles, and a refreshing take on love
Though the offbeat fantasy Penelope begins with the words 
“Once upon a time...” the movie is far from an ordinary 
fairy-tale. Starring Christina Ricci as the title character, 
Penelope is a charming, hilarious, and at times poignant 
testament to the importance of true love and self love.
The story begins with a synopsis of the Wilhern family 
curse, running generations deep in the blue-blooded family. 
According to legend, Penelope’s great-great-(and probably a 
few other greats)-grandfather chose to marry a high-society 
dame instead of the servant girl he impregnated, leading the 
latter to suicide. The dead girl’s mother, conveniently a witch, 
cursed the family, sentencing the first-born female to have 
the face of a pig. Fortunately, generations and generations of 
Wilhern women bore males; that is, until Penelope’s mother 
Jessica (Catherine O'Hara) birthed a snout-nosed, pig-eared 
baby girl.
Freaked out by her offspring’s animalistic features, Jessica, 
along with her less-freaked-out husband Franklin (Richard E. 
Grant), decide to raise Penelope behind closed doors, to save 
their daughter from tabloids and taunting peers alike. The 
doors open, albeit slightly, when Penelope turns 18, as her 
parents and a hired matchmaker struggle to find her a suitor. 
The motivation is clear: The only way to break the curse, as 
mandated by that fateful witch, is to find true love from "one 
of her own kind,” which her parents take to mean a fellow 
blue-blood.
They don’t call them curses for nothing — finding a mate for 
Penelope proves next to impossible. Men run away screaming 
at the sight of her, unable to see past the nose on her face. 
When Penelope finally does find a man willing to give her a 
second glance, he mysteriously backs out when she asks him 
to marry her and break the curse, saying only, “I can’t.”
Devastated, Penelope runs away, hides her snout under 
a scarf, and embarks on life in the city. This leads her to, 
among other things, a quaint hotel, a local tavern, a feeling of 
independence, and Reese Witherspoon, her first-ever gal pal. 
The ensuing story results in the expected happily ever after, 
but Penelope’s journey from point A to point B manages to 
avoid any predictable plot twists and turns.
Beefing (or maybe porking) up the traditional fairy-tale 
repertoire, Penelope is a stellar choice as a date movie, girls’ 
night out, or mother-daughter excursion. Playing Penelope’s 
mysteriously reluctant beau-to-be, James McAvoy shines, 
eclipsing his sexiness from his stark look in Atonement with 
an appeal that only shaggy hair can bring. O’Hara is perfectly 
cast as the well-meaning mother, using skills we knew she 
had from similarly frazzled roles, like, well, anything in the 
Spinal Tap, Best in Show family of films.
Ricci, though perhaps only cast because her eyes are big and 
alluring enough to offset a porky snout, succeeds in portraying 
Penelope’s genuine and free-spirited character. Witherspoon
was spot-on as the street-smart best friend, but for all her 
effort, she was only on screen for something like 15 minutes. 
And Peter Dinklage, playing a journalist with an eye patch 
and a soft spot for his subject matter, truly excels in his most 
significant role since The Station Agent.
Acting aside, Penelope is an aesthetically pleasing trip, with 
quirkily adorable costuming and set design channeling Tim 
Burton (think Big Fish, not Beetle Juice). Penelope’s wardrobe 
alone is worth a watch, as each outfit looks like something a 
fairy princess would buy at Urban Outfitters. On top of that, , 
newbie director Mark Palansky shows off some fancy camera 
movements, which mesh well with the film’s magical nature.
Penelope showed at film festivals in 2006 and 2007, and its 
delay in reaching the U.S. might point toward a flawed flick, 
but the content of the movie proves otherwise. Perhaps 
producers were worried that audiences wouldn’t look past 
the film's oddball premise — but, if Penelope can find love, 
shouldn't her movie?

This is a true story based on the 
memoirs of the late Jean-Dominique 
Bauby, a well-known French 
journalist and former editor of the 
fashion magazine 0/e. The movie 
begins after Bauby suffers a stroke, 
which puts him in a 20-day coma. 
When he wakes up, he discovers 
his entire body is paralyzed except 
for his left eye. The events of the 
film surround Bauby as he attempts 
to write his memoirs by blinking 
whenever the letter he wants 
comes up while a-woman recites 
the alphabet. Nominated for four 
Academy Awards, The Diving Bell 
and the Butterfly is a masterful look 
into the mind of a man who never 
stopped seeing the beauty in life.

Walk Hard: The Dewey 
Cox Story
Friday, March 21
8 10 12
Walk Hard is a fantastic comedy where 
clichés come at you from every corner. 
The movie parodies several famous 
rock groups and musicians, including 
the Beatles and Bob Dylan, along with 
biopics centered around their lives. The 
film follows singer Dewey Cox (played 
by John C. Reilly) — whose music is a 
blend of Jim Morrison, Johnny Cash, 
and seemingly everyone in between 
— as he struggles against all the 
stereotypical hardships of rock and 
roll, including drugs, public backlash, 
and a wife who just doesn’t believe in 
him. A surprising box-office bomb, the 
film made back only half of its budget 
in theaters. Still, Walk Hard is a smart 
comedy with some gut-busting laughs 
that will leave you ROFL-ing for hours.
August Rush
Saturday, March 22 
7:30 10 12:30
August Rush is a sentimental story 
that’s far from realistic, although the film 
makes up for it in its poignant message. 
The story follows the intertwining lives of 
multiple musicians, leading to a moving 
finale that is sure to bring on at least a 
few tears. Nominated for an Academy 
Award for Best Original Song, the 
composer (Mark Mancina) spent almost 
two years completing the entire score 
for the film. Though the movie has been 
called “an inane musical melodrama” 
and “entirely ridiculous” by critics, 
don’t let that stop you from enjoying 
this beautiful and imaginary journey of 
unyielding faith and human spirit.
Soylent Green
Sunday, March 23
8 10 12
Thirty-five years old and still a 
classic, Soylent Green, while just 
a tad bit dated, is a masterpiece 
of sci-fi cinema. Set in the year 
2022 in a dystopian future, the 
movie depicts an overpopulated 
Earth that relies on rations to 
feed its people, the newest of 
which is the mysteriously tasty 
Soylent Green. Charlton Heston 
plays Robert Thorn, a detective 
investigating a murder within the 
Soylent manufacturing company. 
Eventually, the action builds to an 
epic climax, resulting in Heston

Last weekend, the School of Drama completed a 10-day 
run of African-American playwright and Pittsburgh native 
August Wilson’s The Piano Lesson. This was the first of 
Wilson’s plays to be performed at Carnegie Mellon, and one 
of only two productions in the School of Drama's history 
to feature an all African-American cast. The Piano Lesson, 
which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1990, was as much a lesson in 
the history of Pittsburgh as the history of African-Americans 
in the 20th century.
The play is set in Pittsburgh's Hill District in 1936 and 
features a pair of siblings, Berniece (played on alternate 
performances by senior drama majors Amanda Payton 
and Michaela Watkins) and Boy Willie (junior drama major 
Jon-Michael Reese), who fight over the ownership of a 
piano belonging to their ancestors. The piano features 
hand-carvings of the family's story that the siblings’ 
grandfather created while he was a slave in the 19th 
century; for Berniece and Boy Willie, the instrument remains 
a reminder of their ancestry and the hardships endured by 
those family members that came before them.
However, when Boy Willie and his hometown friend Lymon 
(drama junior Kyle Beltran) arrive at Berniece’s home in 
Pittsburgh from down south, the plot settles around one 
fundamental disagreement — Boy Willie wants to sell the 
piano in exchange for land, and Berniece wants to keep it. 
Doaker (drama senior Larry Powell), with whom Berniece 
shares the house, gets caught between them, while up- 
and-coming preacher Avery (sophomore drama major Tyree 
Robinson), is busy trying to secure the reluctant Berniece’s 
hand in marriage.
The play is one of 10 in Wilson’s Pittsburgh Cycle, each 
depicting the black experience during a different decade 
of the 20th century, and all but one set in the Hill District. 
(Ma Barney’s Black Bottom, the third play in the series, is 
set in Chicago.) The Piano Lesson is the only one of Wilson's 
plays to be adapted for the screen to date — a made-for-TV 
version for the Hallmark Channel premiered in 1995, co­
produced by Wilson himself.
The Piano Lesson was inspired by a collage by another 
former Pittsburgh resident, artist Romare Bearden, called 
“Piano Lesson". The painting depicts jazz pianist Mary Lou 
Williams, who also spent her childhood in Pittsburgh. This 
painting, along with an explanation of its significance to 
the production, was on display in the lobby of the Purnell 
Center. The lobby also featured a series of photographs by 
Charles "Teenie" Harris depicting life in Pittsburgh during 
the 1930s The display was created by Breanna Zwart, a 
senior BHA student specializing in dramaturgy who was 
also responsible for piecing together the historical elements 
of the show.
The display set the tone for the show, which demonstrated

New arrivals at the Miller Gallery
Opening of TRANSIT 2008 and appointment of new director
The Regina Gouger Miller Gallery has recently seen 
some changes, both in its exhibits and its staff. A new 
exhibit, TRANSIT 2008, opened on Feb. 29. Apart from the 
installation of the new exhibit, the Miller Gallery has also 
recently hired a new director, Astria Suparak.
Known for her work at Syracuse University’s Warehouse : 
Gallery, where she curated exhibits such as COME ON: \\ 
Desire Under the Female Gaze in 2007, Suparak will succéed 
interim director Petra Fallaux. Suparak's appointment was 
effective from March 1.
“I look forward to leading thè Miller Gallery into its next 
phase, as a vital component of Pittsburgh’s flourishing 
cultural life," Suparak stated in a Feb. 15 press release.
“I envision dynamic collaborations with other local, 
national, and international organizations, bridging diverse 
communities across the campus, the city, and the art worjd 
at large.”
The gallery also welcomes visitors to view its new 
exhibit. Succeeding Plastic Poetics is TRANSIT 2008, 
a cross-cultural exchange featuring a variety of works frorh 
Kyoto University of Art & Design, Nagoya Zokei University 
of Art & Design, Tokyo Zokei University, and Carnegie 
Mellon University. The exhibit had its opening reception on 
Friday, Feb. 29.
TRANSIT 2008 is a reciprocal exhibit, as it features Japanese 
art in America, while the exchange’s previous exhibits wère 
held in Nagoya, Kyoto, and Tokyo and featured Americani 
art. It reflects the collaboration between the universities and 
encourages cultural recognition and diversity.
“It was very nice to see how the schools have come together 
to show their dynamic collaboration in one room,” said 
Zahra Ahmed, a first-year art major.
The exhibit includes sculptures, paintings, printmaking, ! 
drawings, photographs, and videos, spanning across all ; 
the three floors of the gallery. The first floor houses different 
artistic videos by the student artists. The videos can be seen 
on individual television screens and as projections on the; 
wall. There is also a separate area where a large screen hds 
been constructed and different videos are displayed.
One of the videos on the television is of a woman applying 
makeup. As the film progresses, she begins to get messier, 
and eventually smears the makeup all over her face. Another 
video is of a person creating a chain of star-shaped links by 
meticulously connecting them one by one.
The artists found ideas for their videos from different places. 
Julia Stein (she goes by the artist name of "Juliacks”), a 
senior creative writing and art major from Carnegie Mellon, 
was inspired by a graphic novel to create a video entitled To 
have with my eggs.
"It is about a moment in a graphic novel about rage and 
anger and it cycles through [that moment],” she said, 
describing her video.
The second and third floors have paintings, drawings, and 
photographs on the walls, along with sculpture and models 
in different corners. One wall is covered with black and 
white pictures of objects spinning, and is titled “Rotation 
Body,” created by Masao Takenaka of Kyoto University of Art
& Design. Another exhibit is a collection of three paintings 
called "The Shade of Trees I, II, III” by Fumiko Miwa of 
Nagoya Zokei University of Art & Design. These paintings 
are in vivid orange and depict beautifully drawn women 
under tfees.
One piece that is especially interesting and simultaneously 
funny is "Untitled flow chart” by Carnegie Mellon senior art 
and creative writing major Michael L. Pisano. This piece is 
a long and inventive flow chart, beginning with "Japan” and 
proceeding through various connections, finally ending in 
"Pen is dying.”
The exhibit also has different moving models. One called 
"Propelled Flesh,” by Rexy Tang of Carnegie Mellon, consists, 
of a mechanical arm that rotates continuously, pulling along 
a flesh-colored piece of material. This piece aims to contrast 
the unrelenting and mechanical nature of machines to the 
more understanding nature of humans. _
Another interesting exhibit called “From whence it came,” 
created by Carnegie Mellon senior art major Emily K.
Berezin, consists of plates with slices of bread and bologna

the photographs] is not my boyfriend but I loved him and I

*mW
On the whole, the exhibition displayed an impressive 
collection of art from all of the contributing universities. 
What set the exhibition apart was the fusion of Japanese 
and American culture, clearly portrayed through the art.
"I think this is an interesting precedent to collaboration 
between CMU and universities abroad. I hope that in the 
future there are more possibilities to, not just study abroad, 
but to exchange work,” said Laura Miller, a senior ethics, 
history and public policy major at Carnegie Mellon who 
attended the exhibit's opening.
TRANSIT 2008 runs through March 9 at the Regina Gouger 
Miller Gallery.

“breasting" refers to breathing. At least, I

Sororities publish their annual GPAs. At

the average female GPA is 2.525, and 
the average GPA of the entire school is 
2.374. Yikes! In spite of these numbers, I 
would guess that their SPA, or swell point

The RIAA continues its crusade against 
illegal music downloads, mailing over 
400 pre-litigation settlement letters to 
college students. What’s this have to 
do with Carnegie Mellon? Well, as of 
now, nothing. Perhaps the RIAA didn’t 
check into our school to search for 
illegal downloading, if you ask me, I think 
it’s because our students have never 
downloaded anything illegal. In fact, if 
anything, we probably give away our 
music for others to download illegally. 
Wait, what’s that? That’s illegal too? Oh, 
never mind.

Craig Street’s Asian trifecta
A head-to-head (-to-head) comparison of three nearby restaurants
While some stand indecisive at the corner of Forbes Avenue 
and Craig Street, deadlocked between the corporate 
Starbucks and the pleasantly alternative Kiva Han, hungrier 
Pittsburghers face a more formidable decision: where to 
go for Asian food. Mere minutes from Carnegie Mellon, the 
Forbes-Craig region offers a veritable trifecta of options, 
such as chow fun, lo mein, and “with broccoli," among other 
delicacies. Read on for a rundown of the three competing 
restaurants, and have your chopsticks and steamed rice ready
— this could get messy.
Orient Express
4609 Forbes Avenue, 412.622.7232.
Your first stop on the road to rice cakes, Orient Express
— known as "The Orient" by affectionate locals — lives 
up to its name, specializing in cuisine made ready almost 
suspiciously fast. Though ordering at the table is by no means 
a slow process, particularly hurried customers might consider 
calling ahead; by the time you make the five-minute walk 
from Morewood, your shrimp will be with lobster sauce, your 
chicken with cashews, your beef with broccoli. Entrees run $6 
to $9.
The food here is generally low quality, though it has a 
tendency to fill a certain spot. The chicken and tofu are the 
most dependable proteins, as there is about a 10 percent 
chance that beef will come out either too rubbery or too 
crispy. The shrimp and other seafood options are good, but 
tend to come in smaller portions than their aforementioned 
cheaper counterparts. Noodle classic Pad Thai is noticeably 
lacking from the menu. In addition to food, Orient Express . 
offers bubble tea, available warm, iced, and in smoothie form, 
the latter of which is ideal for those inexperienced in the 
world of tapioca-infused beverages.
Around since 2005, Orient Express was closed at the 
beginning of the semester for repairs, but reopened a couple 
of weeks ago with all its facilities intact. The decor is sparse 
but inoffensive, allowing visitors to focus on what’s most 
important: the sauce.
Little Asia
301 S. Craig St., 412.622.0133.
Nestled in a cozy shopping center, Little Asia — nicknamed 
"Asia Minor,” if you will — is a little hard to find but worth 
the effort. The service is not particularly fast or skilled, but 
the food more than makes up for this deficit. Prices are 
comparable to those at Orient Express, but it feels more like 
you’re eating at a real restaurant.
Perhaps the most striking feature of Little Asia's menu is 
an entree called Amazing Chicken, a glorified General Tso’s 
Chicken with white meat. The dish lives up to its name, but
beware, the leftovers take a turn for the unappetizing after 
a couple hours in the refrigerator. (The equally good Sesame 
Chicken and the rest of the chicken options are also available 
in white meat, but you have to ask.) Also impressive is the lo 
mein, which is hearty enough to instill the warm and fuzzies 
in your stomach as you wolf it down (or daintily consume it). 
The Pad Thai is a bit inegular, sporting thick noodles instead 
of the usual skinny ones; it’s enjoyable for a change, and 
endures refrigeration well. As for appetizers, the crab rangoon 
is like a little bite of heaven — or four, actually. (For those 
unaware, crab rangoon are fried dumplings holding warm, 
cream-cheesed bits of crab.)
Try stopping by for the lunch special, where you get an 
entree, fried or steamed rice, and a small appetizer for under 
$6. Tapioca connoisseurs should exercise caution, though, as 
Little Asia does not offer bubble tea.
Another roadblock is the atmosphere, crammed with 
awkward tables and walls at odd angles. Also, customers have 
to use the shopping center bathroom, which requires a long 
walk and a trek down a sketchy staircase.
LuLu’s Noodles
400 S. Craig St., 412.687.7777.
Among the trifecta, LuLu’s is the only restaurant worthy of a 
date or legitimate social outing — that is, unless you know the 
person well. The spacious atmosphere makes for a pleasant 
meal. LuLu’s is also the most expensive and time-consuming 
option of the bunch, but the quality of food and service 
suggest that this is a fair trade. Most LuLu’s enthusiasts can 
probably only tell you about one or two dishes on the menu, 
because once you find an entree you like, it’s hard to justify 
ordering anything else. Though LuLu’s is pricier than its 
competitors (prices for entrees range from $8 to $10), it’s still 
pretty cheap in the scheme of things.
From the photographs on the walls to the artfully crafted 
dishes customers love to order, LuLu’s is known for its 
noodles. The Pad Thai, a standard for many customers, is 
anything but standard; at LuLu’s, the dish is unusually sweet, 
offering a pleasant twist on a classic meal. Also impressive, 
the chow fun and lo mein are both mouth-watering 
without tasting greasy. LuLu’s also offers some standard 
Asian entrees, like General Tso’s Chicken, along with 
more high-class noodle and rice bowls that you won’t find on 
competing menus.
LuLu’s is also a choice destination for bubble tea, offering 
more flavors than Orient Express, and in addition both 
smoothies and freezes (yogurt-free blended drinks).

It’s time to stop being so emo and purge your closet of all that black- 
spring break is almost here.
You might meet your true love in the elevator today. Don't forget to get 
off on the right floor.
An apple a day, especially those red apples, keeps the doctor away.
Don't forget to. wear your boots today — you don’t want your feet to 
get wet.
If the stars speak the truth, today you're invincible.
If you happen to see a shooting star, something amazing is about to 
occur.
Book your airplane tickets for spring break now and they'll be free:
If you step out today and smile in the direction of the sun, it will stop 
snowing.
If you wait patiently enough, you might just get some free chocolate 
covered strawberries from the Carnegie Mellon Café.
Hope you're going somewhere sunny for spring break, for a nasty cold 
is written in your future.
Hoping to broaden your horizons? Reading old English romantic poetry 
can help you achieve that.
If you work hard this week, you can save yourself from drowning in all 
¦the work you'll have once you're back from spring break.
