CARNEGIE CAMP
\ 1To be a Very Useful Feature
It seems that Mr. Carnegie’s indulgence to the stu­
dents of this school is without end.
Not content with furnishing the student with a 
means in the shape of these splendid schools for edu­
cating himself along technical lines sufficiently to 
equip himself for life’s struggle he has gone still 
further and furnished a means by which the student 
can better his health and recuperate his physical be­
ing after months of hard study and grind during the 
school year to obtain this education The means furn­
ished is a place where the student can come, in an 
ideal way, in very close touch with the realm of na­
ture.
As announced on Founder’s Day Mr. Carnegie has 
donated a large piece of land on the Allegheny river 
for the use of the students for camping, engineering 
and other purposes. This piece of land consists of 
750 acres of farm and woodland, which is about 50 
acres larger than the Harvard Engineering Camp 
at Squam Lake, New Hampshire, and has about 1% 
miles water frontage on the Allegheny river. It is 
one of the prettiest spots on the river. There are 
three railroad stations, namely, McKean, Glencairn 
and Garver’s Ferry, located within the boundaries of 
the property and when the camp is put in operation, 
which will be very soon, the Glencairn station will 
be used, as this is located directly in front, and with­
in two stones throw of the old mansion house which 
is to be converted into a club building. The distance 
from Pittsburgh to Glencairn is 26 miles via the Alle­
gheny Valley division of the Pennsylvania Railroad,
and the running time from East Liberty station is 
48 minutes.
The topography of the land is such as to provide 
excellent practice ground for all kinds of surveying 
problems and railroad work and hence will give the 
students of the Civil department a place where they 
can do their surveying and other work undisturbed. 
There are also three streams on the property, one of 
which can be used for hydraulics.
There are also two coal mines in operation on the 
property which will afford excellent opportunities for 
practical work in connection with the course given 
in Mining Engineering.
The Carnegie Camp will be open to all members 
of the Schools, both faculty and students and will 
be available without charge for camping purposes at 
any time of the year. Tents will be furnished by the 
Schools and when the alterations to the house which 
are being made at present by a member of the faculty 
of the School of Applied Design are completed the 
house will have sleeping quarters. This house which 
is being entirely remodelled will also have offices, 
lecture and drafting rooms, kitchens and indoor and 
outdoor arrangements for meals.
The grounds afford a splendid place for all kinds 
of athletics including baseball, tennis, etc., and pro­
bably could be used for a training camp for thé foot­
ball team. Also the close proximity of the water will 
permit of all kinds of aquatic sports being indulged 
in such as boat racing and swimming.

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
Students wishing to use the Carnegie Camp either 
now or during the summer are at liberty to do so 
upon the presentation of matriculation cards to Su­
perintendent Henderson until the house is ready. 
Food supplies can be secured at the stores in Gar- 
ver’s Ferry or Freeport. One of the cuts shown here­
with gives a view of the house on the grounds and 
the other is a picture of Mr. Henderson on board ship.
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF CARNEGIE CAMP.
As the student and faculty of these schools will 
later come into intimate contact at mess table and in 
other ways with the superintendent of the Carnegie 
Camp, a word or two of introduction will not be amiss 
here. Mr. Henderson hails from Scotland and has 
been closely allied with the seafaring profession for 
a considerable period of his life. He received his 
education at the Royal High School of Edinburgh, 
and before going to sea served in the British Volun­
teers, now known as the Territorials.
He served his time as an apprentice on the sailing 
vessels of the British Mercantile Marine and after
spending a very eventful period in this form of ser­
vice in various capacities from apprentice to chief 
officer he entered the Transatlantic liner service in 
which he remained for several years.
Mr. Henderson holds the highest certificate granted 
by the British Government, which certificate entitles 
him to take command of any class of vessel to any 
part of the world. He has been presented with a me­
dal and an address from the king of Norway and a
medal and an address from the Royal Humane Socie­
ty for conspicous bravery on the high seas.
His career has been a very eventful one and reads 
like a story of adventure. He has experienced ship­
wreck, ship on fire in mid ocean, mutiny, starvation 
on board ship, has been in practically every port in 
the world and has circumnavigated the globe several 
times.
Mr. Henderson’s well known efficiency as an officer 
in a profesion where ability and attention to detail 
are attributes of paramount importance will no boubt 
stand him in good stead in his new position.
“Scotty” Henderson of the ’08 class and Dave Hen­
derson of the Junior Mechanicals are brothers of the 
new superintendent.
CARNEGIE TECH WINS EASILY.
West Virginia Swamped.
The track team of the University of West Virginia 
came to Pittsburgh on Saturday for a dual meet with 
Carnegie Tech, but they departed sorrowing. The 
contest was mainly between members of the home 
team, but in some events the Mountaineers made 
things interesting. This was especially true of the 
weight contests, in which Boyle, one of the visitors, 
took two first places and one second, scoring 13 of 
the 23 points secured by the West Virginians.
The visiting team had a touch of hard luck early 
in the meet. R. R. Feller, the only West Virginia man 
entered in the pole vault, received an awkward fall 
in the trials, and twisted his left knee severely. He 
was removed to the hotel after his injury had been 
dressed.
In the two mile run McCrory started his sprint at 
the beginning of the last lap and was almost all in 
with a quarter of a lap to go. His lead was such as 
to allow him to walk the remainder of the distance, 
and take second place, but a well-meaning, if mis­
guided spectator disqualified the runner by helping 
him.
In the pole vault Sutherin broke the school record 
for the event by vaulting 10 feet. Another school 
record to drop was that for the two mile run. Capt. 
Wait, after lowering it 17 seconds in the Inter-school 
meet the previous wek, again dealt it a body blow to 
the extent of 1 2-5 seconds, traveling the route in 
11:10 3-5. A hard track, caused by lack of rain, was 
the reason for slower time in other events.

HOME RUN WINS GAME.
Western Reserve won the game from Carnegie 
Tech by a 6 to 4 score. They were aided by excep­
tional luck in the first inning, and some poor play­
ing by the home team in the third.
The game started with Allen at the bat. Brown 
issued a pass to first in favor of the Cleveland man.
F. Knight on a hit and run play placed himself on 
first with Allen safe at second. Forshee was thrown 
out at first, Brine to Blanchard, each of his prede­
cessors advancing one Kagy was put out at first by 
Blanchard With a man on third and one on second, 
the fans felt no fear, for two men had traveled the 
path of the departed C. Knight, however, thought 
the moment auspicious, and cracked a home run over 
the left fielder’s head, and three runs had been tal­
lied. The hit was a phenom and could rarely be re­
peated.
Two of Tech’s four runs were made in the second 
inning. With one down, Gearhart hit safely and stole 
second. Shenefelt walked and went to second when 
Kirk hit to Finlason who threw Gearhart out at third. 
Blanchard cracked out a double and Shenefelt and 
Kirk scored. Brown sent a fly to left, and retired the 
side. Brown pitched well but was responsible for one 
costly error. Vail and Kirk were the stars in the field. 
The former gathered in a foul fly in the fifth, tak­
ing it with him when he rolled under the stands. 
Kirk showed himself an athlete by jumping high and 
picking a hard one from the cliff in the seventh. 
Brine played a plucky game with a painfully swol­
len hand.
Finlanson and McIntosh starred in the field for the 
Clevelanders, and Allen caught a foul in a sensational 
manner in the first inning.

éTHE TARTAN
BETHANY NEXT.
Bethany College will play at Tech Field on Sat­
urday, May 20th. The West Virginians are re­
ported to have a good team, one which was able to 
win from Washington and Jefferson a few weeks ago 
and it is said they intend to add another scalp to 
their string.
On the other hand, the Varsity is in the best of 
condition and the men are out for blood. Saturday’s 
defeat by Western Reserve was not unexpected, 
but the close score has given the team renewed 
confidence.
Urquhardt is again in condition to pitch and will 
probably start the Bethany game. Capt. Bill Moore- 
head is still out of the game, but hopes to return to 
the first sack in a few weeks.
On Saturday, May 27th, the team will journey to 
Washington and play. The town is near enough to 
allow a number of students to accompany the team 
and root for their favorites.
THE CARNEGIE MUSICAL CLUBS ANNUAL 
BANQUET.
To celebrate a most successful season the Musical 
Clubs and guests met last Friday night at the Hotel 
Schenley and did full justice to a most excellent 
banquet. No only was the spread thoroughly en­
joyed but music filled all gaps between courses and 
afterwards between speeches. The guests were 
Mr. McClintock a Princeton Glee Club Man, Mr. Lee, 
of Design and Mr. Garber of Alumni.
At eight thirty the fellows had their pictures taken
OUR PR.ES.JKS TOASTM AST ErTi
and immediately took their places around the table 
singing, “Waiter Come In With Oysters on the Half 
Shell.” This started things and a strange quiet set­
tled down over the room while large plates of cream 
of mandolin string asparagus were being consumed.
This course was followed by Pepeeta lobster patties, 
squab chicken, Medley salad, Florentine ice cream, 
and various other things. With the Chianti the Glee 
Club sang “Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup,” and 
received so much applause during coffee and cigars 
they rendered several other pieces.

DURING SUNDAY REHEARSALS
If Mr. McDowell would sing a song would Mr. 
McClin-tock? Mr. McClin wouldn’t tock but he sang 
a song instead, “The Prettiest Girl in Borneo,” and 
was accompanied in the chorus by the Glee men. 
Mr. McDowell also gave a treat by singing a Scotch 
love song. »
The speeches by Mr. McDowell, Mr. McClintock and 
Mr. Scalzo were very good. Mr. McDowell, with that 
smile that won’t wipe off and his usual gingery 
style, spoke on the future of music at Tech and of 
the first trip taken by Princeton’s Glee Club. Mr. 
McClintock, a Princeton alumnus, showed the con­
nection between music and college spirit with ex­
amples from his own experience. Mr. Salzo, director 
of the Mandolin Club, added some remarks on the 
possibilities for the future work by the man­
dolin men.
Mr. Lee of the Design School was called upon 
next and proved to be very entertaining, especially 
with his papoose story.
If Aphrodite without her nightie should be placed 
in the museum of arts would Arthur Garber? Mr. 
Garber, of the Alumni Association said he wouldn’t 
be guilty of such an act. He spoke of the interest 
that the alumni have in the student activities and 
said that the best way to insure the association’s 
help was to show them what was needed by having 
an alumnus present at all events of student interest.
The last two speakers of the evening, President 
Goettman and Manager Button charged the new offi­

cers with the responsibility of keeping the clubs on 
the strong foundations already built and of building 
to them. Mr. Goettman remarked upon the past and 
future of the clubs and Mr. Button spoke on college 
music as the truest expression of school life. The

following extract from the menu sizes Button up 
nicely: “You push the Button and he does the rest.”
During the evening every event was punctuated 
by a song or mandolin music. The Fifth Nocturne 
and The Polish Dance by the Mandolin Club Sex­
tette and songs by the Glee Quartette were excep­
tionally fine.
The evening closed with songs and a locomotive 
for the retiring officers and the Musical Clubs.
PITT ENTERTAINS SATURDAY.
One of the largest local track meets is the an­
nual Pitt Intercollegiates held on Schenley Oval. 
These attract athletes from all the colleges of West­
ern Pennsylvania and vicinity and give an idea of 
the results of the intercollegiate championship games 
for the year. That this year’s meet, to be held next 
Saturday, will have the usual number of contest­
ants is shown by the entry list which includes Carne­
gie Tech, Western Reserve, Westminster, Wash­
ington and Jeffrson, West Virginia, Wooster, Indi­
ana Normal and Pitt.
Pitt won a dual meet with Westminster last Sat­
urday by a fairly close score. Judging from this and 
reports from other colleges, the weight events are 
conceded to Pitt, Westminster and West Virginia, 
with a chance for our men to make a place in the 
discus and probably the shot put. Steinmetz has 
excellent prospects of taking the 100-yard dash with 
Crawford to place from among the field of contest­
ants. In the 220-yard dash we are hopeful of secur­
ing two places at least. The hurdle races, when de^ 
cided, should include Crawford and Decker among 
the place men. In the mile and two mile runs, Cap­
tain Wait and McCrory should finish first and sec­
ond if their past performances are true indications 
of what they can do. The 440-yard run is given to 
Indiana Normal for first and probably third, while 
Bryson, of Pitt, is said to be able to take second. 
In the jumps, the results are purely matters of con­
jecture, with a good chance for our men to place. 
The pole vault is generally conceded to Sutherin, 
our man and Vaughn or Lose should qualify for a 
place.
In the past years the meet has been won by Pitt, 
with Tech often a close second. This year has 
given strong teams to many of the local colleges 
and the points should be so split that Tech will 
have an excellent chance of winning the games.
TENNIS TOURNAMENT IS ON.
The annual spring tennis tournament was started 
Monday noon, and is now in full swing. Twenty-four 
men are entered in the contests this year, and, as 
the Varsity team will be selected from the win­
ners, the quartet who will represent the schools 
must show great ability. The games are played on 
the elimination plan. Each team plays three sets 
and the loser drops out of the tournament.

A VERY COMMENDABLE WORK
In order that a criticism of any work be fair and 
unbiased the critic must consider all of the factors 
that enter into and have a direct bearing on the 
production of the work and especially consider those 
factors or influences which tend to prevent the 
production of a work which will come up to the 
satisfaction of the most fastidious.
The most important factors that are essential to 
the successful publication of the annual year book, 
the “Thistle,” are co-operation between the mem­
bers of the Thistle Board and co-operation between 
the student body and the Board.
The 1907 Thistle, which can be taken as a crite­
rion from the standi oint of its prolificness in orig­
inal matter, was published under conditions which 
promoted the aforementioned co-operation. At that 
time the Applied Science, the Applied Industries and 
the Applied Design Schools were all in one building, 
all of the students knew each other, enthusiasm, due 
to the novelty of things, was very strong and every­
thing was conducive to ideal co-operation when any 
activity affecting the entire school, was undertaken.
Conditions are different now, the novelty has worn 
off; the student bodies are larger in number and 
occupy separate buildings; the more exacting cur­
riculum precludes much time being spent by the 
student in school activities and there also appears 
to be a scarcity of students of the altruistic stamp.
For most students it is easily possible to devote 
some of their time to a participation in some school 
activity in spite of an exacting curriculum, yet it
is lamentable to note how many hold aloof and let 
the willing fellow do all the work.
For the first time in the school’s history, this 
year’s Thistle was published under the jurisdiction 
of the Applied Industries School and by a board of 
men who largely volunteered to undertake the dif­
ficult work.
In spite of the many aforementioned obstacles it 
can be said truthfully that it is a very commendable 
piece of work and the Tartan takes pleasure in 
•thanking those gentlemen who have done their work 
so well.
The idea of dedicating the book to Mr. Carnegie 
was well conceived and no doubt will be a source 
of pleasure to him. The book is arranged in a very 
orderly manner. The grinds are very good although 
there could have been more of them. Mr. James K. 
Lamoree is unquestionably the star sketcher; his 
cartoons are peculiarly amusing and best suited to a 
book of this kind. It’s a pity we could not have had 
a few more like his.
The Tartan will not endeavor to criticise each feat­
ure in detail but will leave same to the judgment 
of the Thistle subscribers. It takes pleasure in 
herewith publishing the names of the officials of the 
Board: H. M. Gousha, Editor-in-chief; Miss O. L. 
Jenkins, Ass’t Editor-in-chief; Miss Clara Jayne, 
Secretary; James H. Knapp, Athletic Editor; Charles 
E. Moss, Art Editor; Alfred F. Riedl, Business 
Manager.
GEOLOGY EXPEDITION.
On Saturday, May 13, about twelve of the Junior 
Metallurgists and Sophomore Civils took a very in­
teresting and instructive trip down the Ohio River 
to Rochester and several neighboring towns. Al­
though it was hard to miss the baseball game and 
track meet, not to mention the lady friend we had 
intended to ask, those who took the trip felt well re­
paid for their labors.
A number of interesting geological conditions were 
noted, among them being three river terraces, gla­
cial gravel of all forms and kinds, three different 
seams of coal in one railroad cut, a very highly fos- 
siliferous limestone, different kinds of fire clay, etc. 
We also noticed with interest a large brick yard 
where we saw bricks in all stages of development, 
and also the county jail at Beaver, Pa., recently made 
famous by the second escape of Hickman, a man con­
demned to death.
Professor Smith was always on the job with his 
trusty “tack hammer,” and broke into quite a lot ot 
information. Hetle had quite a time trying to see 
thru the spy glass with the cap on the end. For some 
unaccountable reason, Dornberger and Crane became 
“lost, strayed or stolen,” and did not appear till the 
train pullel into Rochester on the way home.
Osborn and Haas missed the train by “just two 
minutes” and altho they “counted ties” from Roches­
ter to Beaver Falls, after arriving on the next train, 
they did not find the gang.

THURSDAY MORNING LECTURE.
Last Thursday morning the lecturer at the Science 
School was Mr. Chas. S. Scott, Consulting Engineer 
for the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co. 
His subject was ‘The Outlook for the Engineer,’ and 
he is in a position to discuss this subject from all 
standpoint, as he is in possession of data which ex­
plains fully the engineering situation of today. He 
said the greatest object of the engineer should be 
to benefit his fellow men, and showed that this could 
not be accomplished unless the engineer did all his 
work in an unselfish spirit, and was willing to de­
vote his “unearned increment’” to the good of man­
kind.
Mr. Scott showed the great advances of manufact­
ures since the advent of steam and electricity, and 
said that if curves were drawn to represent the rate 
of increase at the present day, they would be rising 
rapidly and show no signs of having reached the 
“saturation point.”
In the time of Christ only about eight of the me­
tals were known and in use. From that time up 
until about twent-five years ago, this number had 
been increased to about fifteen, but since then at least 
fourteen more have been added to the list. Although 
there probably are few remaining to be discovered, 
the field of usefulness of the different alloys of these 
metals is almost unlimited and has barely been en­
tered.
For many years there was a great need felt for 
some kind of a machine which would furnish power 
in small qualities, in cases where as much as is sup­
plied by the locomotive is not needed. The engineer 
came forward and filled this gap by inventing the 
gasoline engine, the small steam engine, and the 
small electric motoi', and developments in this line 
are still going forward rapidly.
There are engineers and engineers, but Mr. Scott 
said that he himself had found it true and that other 
employers agreed with him, that it is not so much 
what a man may know on a particular subject, not 
how bright he may be in one branch or the other, 
but his ability to solve general problems which are 
given him, to analyse the conditions before him and 
cope with the situation, which make him valuable 
in engineering work.
These points and many others were brought out 
by Mr. Scott in his talk, and all the students who 
heard him were undoubtedly encouraged to go for­
ward in their work of becoming engineers.
FAREWELL GAME PLAYED.
The graduating class of the School of Applied In­
dustries celebrated the close of their student days 
at Carnegie Tech by trimming their guides in the 
paths of learning on Friday in a baseball game. The 
final score of 15 to 14 shows that the game was 
warmly contested. Dr. Orbin was the star at the bat 
with four runs in five times at the bat. Baseball in 
all its varieties was exhibited for the edification of
the spectators, among whom was Mr. B. Pfouts. The 
batteries for both sides were recharged repeatedly.- 
The combination that provoked the most enthusiasm 
was Mr. Dosey, pitcher, and Mr. Dortweiler, catcher. 
Although nicknamed “Mutt and Jeff,” they worked 
but a part of an inning, then parted company. Mr. 
Dosey’s drops were too much for the catcher, and Dr. 
Second-bagger was called in to dress his injuries. 
Mr. McCulloch also starred.

TENNIS.
During the past week, the Annual Spring Tourna­
ment to pick men to represent the 1911 Tennis Team 
has been in progress. About twenty-five men have en­
tered and the play has been reasonably close in all 
matches. The Inter-collegiate Tournament, coming 
as it does on the 1st, 2nd and and 3rd of June, goes 
hard with the men from the Science School owing to 
final examinations, but Manager Manker is working 
hard to effect some arrangement with the Geneva 
college authorities so that tennis and the examina­
tions wil not conflict.
It is hoped that by next week definite announce­
ment can be made concerning dual matches with 
Washington and Jefferson and the University of Pitts­
burgh.
PITT—STATE TENNIS MATCH.
On Thursday of this week the tennis teams from 
University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State meet 
on the P. A. A. courts. Good tennis may be expected 
as the men from both schools are experienced play­
ers.

ATHLETIC JOTTINGS.
The management of the track team wishes to thank 
the members of the faculty who served as officials 
in Saturday’s track and field meet for their work.
At a special meeting of the Board of Control of the 
Athletic Association, Alan Bright, 1911, tendered his 
resignation as president. After some discussion it 
was accepted and a vote of thanks extended to Mr. 
Bright for the excellent and energetic manner in 
which he has filled his position. Mr. W. B. Blapchard, 
Science, ’12, was elected to fill the unexpired term.
Last Thursday evening the basketball men met 
and elected W. R. Williams captain for the 1911-12 
season. Mr. Williams is now a Junior Electrical and 
played an excellent game during all of last season.
In the Beaux Arts Class B judgement of May 2, 
Tech was given many unsatisfactory decisions. Sev­
eral drawings were thrown out of competition, the 
plans being over size. Among the plan problems sent 
in by Tech there were two firs tmentions, awarded to
E. J. Holthausen and M. Jones, and nine mentions.
From the order problems, two placed mentions fell 
to us, being given to the drawings submitted by W. H. 
Kirchenbower and A. H. Good. Seven mentions were 
awarded in this elementary branch of class B. The 
judgement was considered unusually strict by many, 
so that several who might have been given awards 
at any other judgement were overlooked in this.
ANNOUNCEMENT.
The gentleman who aspires to become a second 
Mark Twain and who at times, is in the habit of 
dispensing humour, peculiarly Scotch, begs to an­
nounce that he has discovered a young lady who, in 
the course of time, bids fair to take all the conceit 
out of him and hence fulfil his greatest need accord­
ingly as expressed in the Thistle.
Those wishing to see the young lady in question 
can best do so by attending the Senior Ball. He also 
begs to thank the gentleman who called his atten­
tion to this rather unpleasant trait in his make-up 
which is in need of removal.
TEACH SPANISH.
During the past week a petition has been circu­
lated among the members of the Sophomore Class 
asking that during the coming year the faculty start 
a course in Spanish. The petition, which has had 
quite a number of signers, states that owing to the 
not far distant completion of the Panama Canal, much 
closer relationship will be had with those Central 
American countries which have the Spanish language 
as their mother tongue, and that it would be highly 
advantageous ior an engineer to know something of 
the language.

NEW PHYSICIAN SECURED.
Word has been received from the executive offices 
of the schools that Dr. Walter B. Orbin, Resident 
Physician, finds it necessary, owing to the growth 
of his outside practice, to tender his resignation. As 
additional and advance news, comes the announce­
ment that Dr. W. L. Marks, recently graduated from 
the University of Pennsylvania, has been appointed 
to fill his place. Although Dr. Marks is an athlete 
of national reputation, he is not engaged in any sense 
as a coach of athletic teams. This should be thor­
oughly and distinctly understood by the student body.
The loss of Dr. Orbin wil be felt by all the students, 
especially by those who have had occasion to con­
sult him. He leaves with the best wishes of the en­
tire school.
In connection with this, arrangements are being 
pushed forward for the securing of “Tex” Ramsdell, 
of Pennsylvania, as a permanent coach for all spoi'ts. 
No contract has been signed, but the reports are fav­
orable for definite news this week.

IN LOOKING FOR A GIRL WOULD A SEREN-AID?
Sherlocko and his colleague Watso, were not on the 
job last Saturday night or Desperate Dutch and his 
gang would be no more.
About nine o’clock on the night mentioned, some 
dark forms stealthily made their way on the grass 
in the shadow of the P. C. W. buildings until they 
reached the large veranda of one of the dormitories. 
Halting in a deep, dark shadow they preceded to 
steal the hearts of as many Rosamonds as possible 
by singing songs and tingling mandolins. They suc­
ceeded so well that they were invited in. There were 
in all four warblers and six tinkle tinklers, with a 
Button to push and a Desperate Dutch to lead. Des­
perate Dutch knew all the fair damsels and soon had 
every one on friendly terms. After some hours the 
mysterious ones disappeared as stealthily as they 
came.
Some one out there said they were from Tech. 
There is a clue. Sherlocko, now it is up to you and 
Watso to exterminate the gang.
