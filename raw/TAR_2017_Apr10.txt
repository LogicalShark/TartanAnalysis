Provost Farnam Jaha-
nian recently announced 
the Task Force on the CMU 
Experience’s newest mission: 
the UPLift challenege. This 
challenge, which promotes 
the importance of university 
placemaking at Carnegie Mel-
lon, allows students and fac-
ulty members to submit ideas 
to temporarily enhance cam-
pus infrastructure to create a 
more supportive and engaging 
environment.
According to the Project for 
Public Spaces, placemaking 
is a collaborative process by 
community members which 
“inspires people to collectively 
re-imagine and reinvent 
public spaces as the heart of 
every community,” while also 
strengthening the connection 
between people and the places 
they share. “Placemaking facil-
itates creative patterns of use, 
paying particular attention 
to the physical, cultural, and 
social identities that de?ne a 
place and support its ongoing 
evolution.”
Carnegie Mellon University 
will fund up to $20,000 for 
each placemaking project, 
which will be selected and 
executed by a faculty-staff 
committee. Since this is a pi-
lot challenge, submitted proj-
ects are meant to experiment 
with different ways commu-
nity members can temporarily 
enhance Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus infrastructure and 
in?uence our campus culture 
for up to one year.
“Pilots are all about learn-
ing,” Daragh Byrne, a member 
of the Campus Infrastructure 
working group of the Task 
Force on the CMU Experience 
who has been helping to lead 
the UPLift Challenge initiative, 
said. “We are actively looking 
for unproven, untested ideas 
that we can try for a while. 
Through these temporary 
interventions, we can gain 
invaluable insight into what 
can make our experience and 
our campus better, in both the 
short and long-term.”

This past week the Wesley 
Spectrum, a local non-pro?t 
organization, began partner-
ing with locally-owned Panera 
Bread stores to sell cookies 
with the international au-
tism symbol on them for their 
“Every Cookie Counts” fun-
draiser. The proceeds will go 
directly to Wesley’s programs 
for autism.
The Wesley Spectrum is an 
organization that has reached 
over 5800 families and chil-
dren with their services. With 
three locations in the Pitts-
burgh area, Wesley Spectrum 
offers several onsite and out-
patient programs. Many of 
their programs are set to tar-
get both children and teens 
and some, such as their Won-
derskills social skills program, 
have a curriculum that con-
tinues to develop and adapt 
to their needs as the children 
get older. Some of the pro-
grams bene?ting from “Every 
Cookie Counts” are Healthy 
Relationship, Behavioral 
Health and Rehab Services, 
and Creative Arts.
The Healthy Relationship 
program is set to target 
transition-age youth that are 
starting to enter more serious 
friendships and relationships. 
It helps the students develop 
skills for more adult interac-
tions, such as helping students 
with relationship and dating 
skills. It shows them different 
ways to handle situations like 
going out for a cup of coffee. 
Beyond just showing them 
skills for simple dates, Healthy 
Relationship also teaches 
them what a 
healthy relation-
ship looks like.
Creative Arts 
is another pro-
gram that will 
receive funding 
from the “Every 
Cookie Counts” fundraiser. 
This program is open to any-
one with behavioral health 
issues. It allows participants 
to express themselves through 
various forms of art such as 
dancing, signing, drawing, 
and playing instruments. 
Out of this group, some par-
ticipants have formed rock 
bands that have performed at 
churches, local fairs, and even 
Pirates games.
Wesley Spectrum does not 
just limit its work to children 
impacted by autism. It also 
makes an effort to reach out 
to parents. “We work with 
parents so they can take over 
when Wesley Spectrum isn’t 
there,” director of Public Policy 
and Strategy, Michelle Sloane 
explained in an interview 
with The Tartan. “We hope to 
decrease stigma and increase 
community awareness for 
autism.” She explained that 
early diagnosis and evalua-
tion is important in the suc-
cess rate of their programs. 
Many of their programs start 
working with children at a 
young age, and follow them as 
they grow older.
Wesley Spectrum will also 
be using the funds from “Ev-
ery Cookie Counts” to acquire 
new equipment for sensory 
rooms. “These rooms are de-
signed to help those that are 
sensitive to surroundings,” 
Sloane explained. The space is 
usually a large room with big 
maps, low lighting, and lighter 
shades of colors. There are 
also water bubble machines 
and other things that make 
the room a calm environment 
for soft talking and soothing 
conversations.
With programs and 
services that are constantly 
expanding to reach more 
and more families, Wesley 
Spectrum is always looking for 
new members and additional 
resources to help their cause. 
“We have a wide variety of ser-
vices and positions both 
on and offsite for anyone 
looking to get involved. 
Whether it’s interacting 
with families and chil-
dren or doing admin-
istrative work, there’s 
always something to do.”
Wesley Spectrum provides 
a large number of services to 
children and families in Pitts-
burgh, ranging from help with 
autism and behavioral health 
to education and support for 
families whose lives have been 
impacted by autism. More 
information about “Every 
Cookie Counts” and Wesley 
Spectrum can be found at

Two student startups earn investments in the McGinnis venture competitionLecture focuses on accomplished female architects at Carnegie Mellon University 
Based on data compiled 
by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, roughly 14 percent 
of architects are female and 
it appears that there is gender 
discrimination in the ?eld.
However, at Carnegie 
Mellon University, more 
than 50 percent of the ?rst-
year class for the School of 
Architecture has been made 
up of women for these past 
two years. The Associa-
tion of Collegiate Schools of 
Architecture says this statistic 
is well above those of other 
undergraduate schools in the 
country.
“When my wife started at 
Carnegie Tech in 1968, she 
was one of three women out 
of a class of 65,” School of 
Architecture Head Stephen 
Lee said in a press release. 
“During the 2000s we built 
up to 40 percent female en-
tering and during the 2010s, 
we enroll two women for 
every man.”
Special faculty member for 
the School of Architecture, 
Spike Wolff, is cognizant 
about these disadvantages in 
the architecture ?eld. Since 
2009, Wolff has put on a 
lecture series that showcases 
a selection of diverse archi-
tects and their variety of work. 
This year’s lecture was sepa-
rated into two themes: the fall 
semester lecture focused on 
cultural climate and how that 
in?uenced architecture, while 
the spring semester series fo-
cused on female architects.
“In a way, this series 
advocates for inclusion, 
without compromising 
standards,” Wolff said. 
This lecture discussion has 
facilitated student conversa-
tion about women in archi-
tecture and gender rights as a 
whole.
“The students seem pretty 
receptive and enthusiastic 
to these two themed series, 
both politics in the fall and 
all women in the spring,” 
Wolff said in the press re-
lease. “It’s good for students 
to have strong role models, 
to see women at the top 
of their ?eld.”

The Undergraduate 
Student Senate, as has been 
explained to me by Ryan 
LaPré, has chosen not to 
ratify the Senate elections 
results and will be holding 
a re-election. This is due to 
their belief that the “No Con-
?dence” option was insuf?-
ciently explained to voters on 
the ballot. This means that we 
will be hosting another on-
line election, beginning next 
Friday, April 14 at 10 a.m., 
and ending the following 
Tuesday, April 18 at 10 a.m., 
with all the same candidates 
who were on the ?rst ballot. 
Elections Board is currently 
working with Senate and the 
executive board on drafting 
new language to explain the 
“No Con?dence” option on 
the ballot.
After counting up the 
votes for the Senate elections, 
there were still many vacant 
seats left. The effect of “No 
Con?dence” being inef?-
ciently explained might be 
the reason for this, since “No 
Con?dence” got a higher 
vote count than some of the 
candidates, effectively elimi-
nating those candidates. By 
the Student Senate Bylaws, a 
vote of no con?dence is a vote 
against all candidates who 
are in the running for the rel-
evant vacant seat. However, 
not all students use the No 
Con?dence vote in this way, 
leading to confusion on the 
actual desires of the student 
body. Other possible reasons 
are a low actual con?dence 
in candidates for Senate or 
low voter turnout (skewing 
the weight of no con?dence 
votes).
It may seem silly to some 
that a re-election is happen-
ing. My belief is that fair elec-
tions are enabled when vot-
ers have a full understanding 
of their voting options and 
what they mean. Senate’s 
commitment to fair elections 
through fair language indi-
cates their passion for proper 
and informed representation, 
which is the true intention of 
Student Government. If seats 
remain empty after the sec-
ond voting session, vacancy 
elections can still be held to 
?ll these seats.
My hope is that in this next 
election, any confusion with 
the voting options is alleviated 
by the new language explain-
ing the “No Con?dence” vote, 
and that we see a great voter 
turnout. Between now and 
Friday, April 14, reach out to 
a former Senator of your col-
lege and learn more about our 
Student Senate and their role 
in it! If you have any further 
questions on this new elec-
tion, contacting the Elections 
Board is a great place to start!
In Carnegie Mellon’s 2017 
McGinnis Venture Competi-
tion, startups RoBotany and 
Inventory Connection se-
cured top winnings.
“The McGinnis Venture 
Competition is the culmi-
nation of the entrepreneur-
ship training we provide 
students at Carnegie Mel-
lon,” said Dave Mawhinney, 
executive director of the 
Swartz Center for Entrepre-
neurship, in a press release. 
“The McGinnis Venture 
Competition is an opportu-
nity to bring it all together 
and showcase their compa-
ny’s potential to real-world 
investors.”
From the competition, 
RoBotany earned a $25,000 
investment for getting ?rst 
place in the graduate stu-
dent section. RoBotany was 
founded by business admin-
istration master’s students 
Austin Webb and Daniel 
Seim. Their company makes 
robotic indoor vertical farm-
ing using automated robot-
ics and software analytics to 
impact modern agriculture.
“RoBotany has been very 
fortunate to have the oppor-
tunity to plug into Carnegie 
Mellon and the Tepper 
School’s entrepreneurial 
ecosystem,” Webb said. “I 
have been able to marry 
my education at the Tepper 
School with the growth 
and progress of RoBotany, 
allowing for immediate ap-
plication of my learning in 
an experiential learning 
setting.”
The company Inventory 
Connection, which was 
founded by senior electrical 
and computer engineering 
and engineering and public 
policy major Kerolos Mi-
kaeil, won the undergradu-
ate competition. Inventory 
Connection gives sales rep-
resentatives real-time inven-
tory and point sale data as a 
way to stock shelves better. 
They received $4,000 from 
the competition.
This past week, CMU UNICEF displayed signs and ?ags along the College of Fine Arts lawn to raise awareness about its lifesaving programs for children around the world. Representatives were also available to provide additional information.

According to the 
challenge’s website, proposals 
can seek to create brand new 
indoor greenspaces, can plan 
to renovate gathering spaces 
or shared “nooks,” or can be 
as simple as creating more 
comfortable benches. “We are 
looking for any kind of renova-
tion or re-imagining of campus 
places that can be executed for 
up to $20,000,” Byrne said.
“In addition to UPLift, our 
group is really excited about 
the renovation of several 
‘nooks’ on campus,” Mar-
sha Lovett, co-chair of the 
Campus Infrastructure work-
ing group of the Task Force 
on the CMU Experience, said. 
The “Nooks” Project is an ef-
fort to renovate shared, small 
public spaces where students 
gather together to learn and 
collaborate. Its goal is to keep 
the community connected and 
engaged while we learn, grow, 
and discover together. “Just by 
adding seating, lighting, white 
boards and outlets, we can 
transform an empty corner 
into a learning environment 
for students,” Lovett said. This 
summer, the ?rst two “nooks” 
to be upgraded will be in the 
?fth ?oor of Wean Hall and 
the College of Fine Arts base-
ment.
In addition to the “Nooks” 
Project, The UPLift challenge 
is yet another way the Task 
Force has embraced the idea 
that “small, creative place-
making projects can make a 
big difference,” Jahanian said 
in his email.
When asked about how he 
hopes the UPLift challenge 
will bene?t the Carnegie Mel-
lon community, Byrne stated 
that he hopes it will remind us 
that “our campus environment 
is not just a backdrop, but a 
shared playground, work space 
and home that can meaning-
fully in?uence our community 
and culture” while also ?tting 
into the Task Force’s ultimate 
goal of reinforcing health and 
wellness, school pride, and the 
open exchange of ideas as core 
community values.
Kristen Kurland, co-chair 
of the Campus Infrastructure 
working group of the Task 
Force on the CMU Experience 
adds that “more than any-
thing else, this is an exciting 
conversation starter. Even if 
an idea isn’t executed, hearing 
directly from our community 
about what they feel is miss-
ing from campus will help to 
reveal possible problems and 
suggest solutions.”
The Task Force for 
the CMU Experience will 
continue to move forward 
with other infrastructure 
projects such as building 
the Tepper Quadrangle and 
creating a new health and 
wellness center. They are 
also currently working on 
projects to renovate class-
rooms, reform academic 
policies, and expand mental 
health care.
Applications for ideas 
may be submitted by April 
28 at http://www.cmu.edu/

picoCTF competition promotes computer security awareness
EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
For the third time, students 
all over the nation have the 
chance to participate in and 
compete for prizes at the annu-
al picoCTF competition hosted 
by Cylab, the security and pri-
vacy institute at Carnegie Mel-
lon. The online competition is 
open to people everywhere, 
but only middle and high 
school students in the U.S. are 
eligible for cash prizes, which 
totaled over $30,000 this year 
thanks to corporate sponsors 
of the event.
CTF stands for capture 
the ?ag, and this virtual 
game has previously drawn 
almost 30,000 participants. 
The major theme of picoCTF 
is computer security. Par-
ticipants must solve a series 
of challenges surrounding a 
story line over a period of two 
weeks as the challenges get 
harder the further one goes in 
the competition. In essence, 
the competition, according 
to a university press release, 
teaches students “the basics of 
hacking.”
The challenges involve 
various computer-security 
related skills, such as 
reverse-engineering, hacking, 
or decrypting.
Even though the 
competition has already start-
ed, it is not too late to register, 
as registration is open until the 
end of the event on April 14.
The goal of the competi-
tion is not only to have fun, 
but also to promote aware-
ness of computer security as 
a potential career ?eld. Cur-
rently, there is a shortage of 
computer security experts, 
and one of picoCTF’s main 
goals is to make up for this 
shortfall, according to David 
Brumley, the electrical and 
computer engineering pro-
fessor who also serves as the 
project leader of picoCTF and 
the director of Cylab. “The 
root of the problem is that 
most people don’t even know 
that computer security is a 
?eld they can go into. Build-
ing awareness is a major goal 
of picoCTF,” says Brumley in 
the press release. According 
to Brumley, the competition 
helps build the critical think-
ing skills necessary for think-
ing and performing at a high 
level in challenges relating to 
computer security.
Carnegie Mellon has open-
sourced the competition’s 
code so that other schools can 
create their own CTF compe-
titions which can introduce 
more students to the ?eld of 
computer security. Many high 
schools have already done so, 
creating Phillips Academy CTF 
and Thomas Jefferson CTF, 
among other examples.
There have already been 
examples of successes in terms 
of getting students interested 
in the ?eld of computer secu-
rity. One of these success sto-
ries is Tim Becker, an under-
graduate studying computer 
security at Carnegie Mellon 
and captain of the school’s 
student hacking team, the 
Plaid Parliament of Pwning 
(PPP). PPP has won DefCon’s 
CTF competition — often 
known as “the Super Bowl 
of hacking” — three times in 
the past four years. Becker 
got into this ?eld because he 
competed in picoCTF in 2013 
as a high school student and 
unexpectedly ?nished in third 
place, better than anyone on 
his team would have thought 
possible. “That’s how I ended 
up getting into this ?eld,” says 
Becker in the press release.

At Wednesday’s rati?cation 
meeting following this year’s 
student government elections, 
Student Senate voted 9–10–2 
not to ratify the results of the 
Senate elections, upholding 
that the Elections Board did 
not communicate with Student 
Senate during the elections 
process, as they are constitu-
tionally required. The results 
for the Student Government 
Executive positions were 
rati?ed.
According to the Student 
Body Election Rules, “If the 
number of ‘no con?dence’ 
votes exceeds a simple major-
ity of votes cast for a position, 
then there shall be a vacancy 
in that position.” As a result 
of the rule in this election, 
“no con?dence” received 
enough votes to oust several 
candidates.
Most notably, the Dietrich 
College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences was left with 
only four of its nine seats ?lled, 
despite there being nine candi-
dates who ran. The College of 
Engineering only ?lled ?ve of 
12 seats, despite there being 
nine candidates who ran.
Some voters are concerned 
that this result can be attribut-
ed to a mishandled transition 
to a single transferable vote 
system (STV).
“STV allows voters to rank 
their preferred candidates and 
have their votes transfer as 
candidates are eliminated or 
elected. This leads to approxi-
mately proportional represen-
tation and avoids the spoiler ef-
fect of splitting votes between 
similar candidates,” explained 
junior electrical and comput-
er engineering major Devin 
Gund, who serves as Chair of 
the Senate Committee on Busi-
ness Affairs as well as Senate’s 
representative to the Elections 
Board. He was largely respon-
sible for implementing the 
change to STV.
“I can say with full certainty 
that the single transferable 
vote system was not the cause 
of this outcome,” Gund main-
tained. “STV resulted in fairer 
elections than the previous 
?rst-past-the-post system. For 
example, the ability for voters 
to rank their preferred candi-
dates meant that the election 
for Vice President of Finance 
ended with a winner pre-
ferred by a majority of the stu-
dent body to any other single 
candidate, which would not 
have occurred in the previous 
system.”
The issue with the voting, 
however, seems to have been 
more to do with the language 
used on the ballot than the 
STV system itself. The ballot 
instructions may have misled 
voters about the signi?cance 
of voting “no con?dence” 
as opposed to leaving the 
remainder of the ballot blank.
Gund reported that the 
language on the ballot was 
approved by the Student 
Government Executive 
Committee, consisting of the 
Student Body President, Vice 
President, Vice President 
for Finance, Vice President 
of Organizations, Senate 
Chair, and the Graduate 
Student Assembly President. 
It was not approved by the 
Student Senate.
The Student Body Election 
Rules state that, in the event 
of a failed rati?cation, there 
should be another elec-
tion within 10 days. Polls 
will reopen at 10 a.m. this 
Friday, April 14, until 10 a.m. 
Tuesday, April 18. Online 
voting will be at cmu.edu/
studentvote, and physical poll-
ing locations will be open 2–4 
p.m. on Friday and 4–6 p.m. 
next Monday outside of the 
Cohon Center.

Trump’s Syrian decision needed further deliberation
On Thursday, April 9, President 
Donald Trump ordered the launch 
of 59 Tomahawk missiles, which 
struck Al Shayrat air?eld in Syria 
and resulted in the deaths of 15 
people and further uncertain global 
consequences.
According to Trump, the decision 
to launch the missiles was a direct re-
sponse to the brutal chemical attack 
that killed dozens of people — many 
of them children — in the Idlib prov-
ince in northwestern Syria on April 
4. He said it was “vital [to] national 
security” that the United States “pre-
vent and deter the spread and use of 
deadly chemical weapons,” mention-
ing despair over the infants who were 
harmed and an overall desire to “end 
the slaughter and bloodshed” as an 
explanation for his actions — sympa-
thies that many Americans share and 
want our country to act on.
But Trump, who was resolutely 
against taking action against Syria 
until this decision, acted quickly and 
without the approval of Congress — 
for all we know, he acted without 
any concrete plans for his next move 
at all. Furthermore, he may have in-
spired the disapproval, or downright 
anger, of many other countries 
thanks to his impulsive choice. 
Russia has condemned the strike as 
a “disgraceful attack,” and Germany 
and France have refused to endorse 
the attack.
Tuesday’s chemical attack, which 
reportedly originated at the air?eld, 
was carried out early in the morn-
ing when many were still sleeping. 
Eyewitnesses at the scene reported 
waking to the sound of an explosion, 
only to go outside and ?nd people 
in the street choking and unable to 
move, with constricted pupils. Other 
symptoms included vomiting, faint-
ing, and foaming at the mouth. Later 
in the day, rockets were ?red at the 
hospitals and clinics treating the 
survivors of the ?rst attack, burying 
doctors and patients in rubble.
The death toll of the attacks var-
ies by account, but most likely falls 
somewhere between 50 and 100 — 
and the number injured throughout 
the day is thought to be much great-
er. Both the Syrian government and 
the Russian government are denying 
their involvement in the attacks, but 
the United States maintains that Syr-
ia was behind the attack and Russia 
was “complicit.”
Trump’s decision to attack the 
air?eld may be an important ?rst 
step in the effort to put an end to 
the excessive violence against the 
Syrian people, but it’s too soon to 
say. At this point, we have no way of 
knowing that his actions won’t also 
have harmful consequences of their 
own. Based on his record and what 
we know about the attack, there is 
reason to doubt whether he even 
considered such an impact before 
moving forward with the attack.
Concerning to many is the fact 
that Congress was not involved in 
the decision to launch the missiles. 
Trump ordered the attack after only 
two days of deliberations with his 
own security advisors — and some 
meetings actually took place, not in 
the White House, but at his Mar-a-
Lago estate in Florida.
Whether the strike was legal in 
the United States or not is the subject 
of debate in the media — murky 
precedents regarding national inter-
ests, the War Powers Resolution, and 
the actions of former presidents have 
been used to frame the decision as a 
misuse of presidential powers or a 
justi?ed humanitarian intervention 
that will also protect American inter-
ests in the end. Either way, involving 
more people in the decision would 
have been a guarantee that the pos-
sible consequences of the strike had 
been more thoroughly considered 
and accounted for in plans for the 
future.
Such repercussions, if they 
come, would develop from the 
international response to the strike. 
Already, countries have been re-
sponding to Trump’s decision, and 
some of their reactions haven’t been 
very supportive. Russia, Iran, and 
China strongly oppose the strike, 
condemning the United States’ deci-
sion and even suggesting that Trump 
violated international policies by act-
ing against Syria.
More complications could ensue 
if it turns out that Trump did break 
international law. According to the 
United Nations Charter, which the 
United States has rati?ed, the only 
valid reasons for using force on an-
other country’s soil are for self de-
fense, or with the permission of the 
United Nations Security Council. 
Trump’s reason for attack — pre-
venting Syria from further use of 
chemical weapons — was not self 
defense. The Council, like Congress, 
was not a part of Trump’s decision. 
One can argue many reasons why the 
attacks were necessary, and many 
reasons why they weren’t. What re-
mains, however, is that the decision 
should have been more carefully 
deliberated.
Can we applaud the choices of 
a man who acts with no serious 
thought for those he leads or what 
impact his impulses may have on a 
global scale? Can we condemn an ac-
tion that might have been an impor-
tant stand against the slaughter of 
innocent men, women, and children 
in a country that has suffered for far 
too long? With an issue as nuanced 
and volatile as this one, perhaps 
the best way forward is one that 
involves many careful minds work-
ing together and carefully weigh-
ing every option. Trump needs to 
be sure he comprehends the serious 
impact his actions could have as he 
considers his next move. The lives of 
those suffering in Syria are of utmost 
importance, but so is the safety of 
Americans and other people across 
the globe.

While the 2016 elections might 
be (mercifully) over, there are still 
a few lingering special federal elec-
tions to take care of before we can ?-
nally wash our hands of the painful, 
messy practice of democracy. Five 
congressional seats are up for grabs 
in special elections over the next few 
months. Four of the ?ve seats were 
vacated by Republicans appointed 
to positions in the Trump adminis-
tration. Two of those seats, as well 
as a ?fth seat vacated by former 
Rep. Xavier Becerra who became 
California’s Attorney General, are in 
uncompetitive districts. But the oth-
er two represent potential pick-up 
opportunities for Democrats looking 
to convert President Trump’s unpop-
ularity into new seats in Congress. 
Unfortunately, Democrats are dis-
playing some of the same short-
sighted thinking that cost them big 
in 2016 and in other elections up 
and down the ballot since 2010.
The special election that has 
gotten most of the attention is in 
the sixth congressional district of 
Georgia, which represents parts of 
the northern suburbs of Atlanta. 
This seat was vacated by Tom Price, 
who became Trump’s Secretary of 
Health and Human Services. The 
Democratic candidate is Jon Ossoff, 
a thirty-year-old documentary ?lm-
maker and former congressional 
staffer for Civil Rights icon John 
Lewis. There are several Republican 
candidates, most notably former 
Georgia Secretary of State Karen 
Handel and businessman Bob Gray. 
If no candidate wins an outright 
majority in the April 18 special elec-
tion, then the winner will be decid-
ed in a run-off election a few weeks 
later between the top two ?nishers.
The other competitive elec-
tion is for Montana’s at-large 
Congressional District. This seat 
was vacated by Ryan Zinke, who 
became Trump’s Secretary of the 
Interior. The Democratic Candi-
date is Bernie-backing populist Rob 
Quist, a popular Montana folk-sing-
er with no political experience but a 
history of public service in Montana. 
The Republican candidate is Greg 
Gianforte, a businessman who was 
the Republican candidate for gover-
nor of Montana in 2016.
Everyone, from the media to 
Democratic activists, ?gures, and 
organizations, has focused their at-
tention on the Georgia election. And 
this is understandable. For Demo-
crats to have a chance at winning 
back the House of Representatives 
in 2018, they will need to win in 
districts like GA-6; suburban dis-
tricts that lean Republican but have 
wealthy, well-educated, and gen-
erally socially liberal voters. And 
the anti-Trump sentiment is strong 
there. Trump beat Hillary Clinton 
by just 1.5 points, whereas Romney 
beat Obama in the same district by 
twenty-three points in 2012.
However, Democrats have been 
far too reluctant to spend any time, 
resources, or money in the Montana 
election. This is a huge mistake 
and one that is motivated by intra-
party politics more than sensible 
strategy. According to a report by 
KTVH, a Montana news station, no 
major Democratic group or party 
campaign apparatus has shown 
any interest in Quist’s election. 
Even the Democratic Congressio-
nal Campaign Committee (DCCC), 
which is charged with helping staff 
and ?nancing Democratic House 
campaigns, hasn’t spent a dime on 
outside expenditures supporting 
Quist or direct contributions to his 
campaign committee. They don’t 
even mention the race on their web-
site. By comparison, the DCCC has 
supported Ossoff’s campaign by 
sending nine staffers, funding quali-
tative research, and contributing 
thousands of dollars.
With only two competitive races 
to focus on, it is hard to believe that 
the DCCC and other Democratic 
Party groups are ignoring Quist 
merely to prioritize allocation of 
their limited resources. After all, 
the DCCC has no trouble dispens-
ing hundreds of staff members and 
millions of dollars to support dozens 
of competitive congressional races 
during regular election years. Rath-
er, it seems like they are giving Quist 
the cold shoulder, repelled by his 
independent persona and insurgent 
political style. Quist is a political 
outsider, a populist who supported 
Bernie Sanders in the Democratic 
primary election and backs pro-
gressive ideas like a single payer 
healthcare system. He’s also willing 
to buck the party when it comes to 
issues like gun control, holding a 
much more pro-gun stance than the 
party’s. Tepid support from the na-
tional Democratic Party for progres-
sives and party outsiders is nothing 
new, and it seems clear that they 
have little interest in supporting 
such a candidate this time around.
The Democratic Party has made 
this mistake time and again, and it 
has cost them big. For example, in 
2016, the Democratic Senatorial 
Campaign Committee shot itself in 
the foot in the key Pennsylvania 
Senate race by spending nearly $2 
million on Katie McGinty during the 
primary campaign against Admiral 
Democrats must back 
even risky candidates

Joe Sestak. It was clear that they 
were motivated at least in part by a 
grudge that they have held against 
Sestak since he challenged and de-
feated former Senator Arlen Spec-
ter in the 2010 Democratic Senate 
primary. Sestak eventually lost to 
Pat Toomey. But that $2 million 
would have likely secured victory 
for McGinty or Sestak during the 
general election. Is it possible that 
Democrats are making the same 
mistake yet again with Quist?
“But wait,” you might say, 
“isn’t Montana a super-Republican 
state? Might the Democrats not 
be supporting Quist simply be-
cause he doesn’t stand a chance?” 
Yes, Montana is a very Republican 
state, but it is wrong to assume that 
a Democrat can’t win this special 
election, especially one like Quist. 
In fact, Democrats have won ?fty-
?ve percent of statewide elections 
in Montana over the past twenty-
?ve years, including the governor’s 
race in 2016 and a senate race in 
2012. Montana voters split their 
tickets to vote for candidates from 
both parties more than voters in 
any other state. Meanwhile, Quist 
is exactly the type of Democrat 
who can win in Montana: an au-
thentic and charismatic presence, 
a well-known and well-liked Mon-
tana ?gure, whose personality 
resonates with Montana’s rugged 
and folksy culture. Plus, Mon-
tana voters already demonstrated 
that they are willing to elect a 
Democrat over Gianforte, who 
lost to Democratic Governer Steve 
Bullock by four points in 2016. The 
only public poll conducted in the 
race so far shows Quist crushing 
Gianforte by seven points, a much 
stronger showing than any poll 
shows for Ossoff in his election.
By ignoring Quist, Democrats 
are throwing away a winnable 
race. They’re also squandering 
a valuable chance to build up 
momentum and campaign infra-
structure in Montana, which they 
will need to defend Senator John 
Tester’s crucial and extremely vul-
nerable Senate seat in 2018. Addi-
tionally, they’re missing an oppor-
tunity to try out an unconventional 
candidate and campaign message 
that might help them compete in 
other rural districts in the future. 
Perhaps most importantly, they are 
once again alienating progressives 
within the party, opting to silence 
their base even though it may cost 
them a congressional seat. Demo-
crats are ignoring Quist for all the 
wrong reasons, and it’s a strategic 
failure that the party should cor-
rect immediately.

Somehow, the U.S. has become 
an overeager sentry, a guard of the 
thousands of human-?lled cartons 
littering the nation. These prisons 
contain the country’s convicts, the 
two million unforgiven offenders 
conveniently estranged from society 
in these effective human warehouses.
But are our prisons truly effective? 
We often forget that the vast majority 
of these “unfortunates” will someday 
rejoin us, changed by the months, 
years, or decades spent forgotten 
in a box. And, unfortunately, they 
are usually changed for the worse. 
The justice system has become an 
ef?cient factory of criminals, churn-
ing out convicts more hardened and 
knowledgeable than 
when they entered.
Prison conditions 
have deteriorated into 
appallingly unsafe envi-
ronments. Inmates learn 
to distrust everyone, 
especially the guards, 
these forgotten sentinels 
who are often no less in 
need of correction than 
those whom they watch. 
If we imprison a person 
and treat them as hostile 
and untrustworthy, re-
gardless of the atrocities 
they’ve committed, how 
can we expect them to 
behave as anything else?
We, the supposed 
leaders of the free world, 
are in possession of a 
“correctional” system 
that fails to correct. It is 
our responsibility to in-
vest in erasing this stain 
on the American justice 
system. Rather than 
continuing to dehuman-
ize these millions whom 
we’ve imprisoned, we 
must teach them to be 
productive members of 
our society again.
The ?rst step of trans-
formation is to ensure 
that the prisoners, while 
still punished for their 
crimes, are treated as hu-
man beings. This begins 
with eliminating corrup-
tion among the supervi-
sors and guards of each 
prison.
One way this may 
be accomplished is by 
increasing federal over-
sight of these systems. 
More vigorous employ-
ment quali?cations, and 
re-evaluating the hiring 
and promotion process 
for correctional of?cers would also 
help ensure their fair treatment.
Next, while reform programs 
for inmates do exist, they are not 
built into the justice system. Man-
dated access to resources such as 
literature, science, and philoso-
phy is essential to development. 
Shaka Senghor, a second-degree 
murderer, served 19 years in vari-
ous prisons, seven of which were in 
solitary con?nement. He is now a 
college lecturer, author, and direc-
tor’s fellow of the Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology Media Lab, and 
attributes his reformation to litera-
ture where he was able to “free [his] 
mind and expand [his] thinking.”
Those who criticize the ?nancial 
cost of such programs should consid-
er the astounding size of our prison 
system. We currently imprison 2.3 
million people across the country 
— to the point where the U.S. has 
more jails than colleges. California, 
New York, New Jersey, and Rhode 
Island are the few states who have 
approached reform determinedly in 
their prison systems, and have thus 
succeeded in reducing their prison 
populations by more than 20 percent 
since 2009. These states are proof 
that lighter sentences are possible 
without compromising public safety.
This can be achieved through re-
alistic alternatives to the aggressive 
sentences that are common now. 
A report by the Brennan Center for 
Justice at New York University School 
of Law suggested expanding on alter-
natives such as drug treatment pro-
grams, community service for the 25 
percent of prisoners convicted only 
of nonviolent, low-level crimes, and 
the termination of mandatory mini-
mum sentences.
These ambitions are more pos-
sible than many realize. As Bill Keller 
observed in an article published in 
The New York Times the current cli-
mate in Congress is actually very 
amenable to the prospect of reform, 
for several reasons, one of which is 
that Republicans are seeking a bipar-
tisan victory to reassure the people 
that the government is competent 
and reliable.
With each convicted offender, 
our justice system takes upon itself 
the responsibility of their life for the 
next two or twelve or twenty years. 
It removes that person’s agency over 
their own life and authorizes itself to 
control every aspect. Unfortunately, 
for decades, we have neglected this 
responsibility, sentencing millions to 
abusive environments with minimal 
prospect of a viable future. With sup-
port for prison reform now growing 
greater in this country, it is time ac-
cept this responsibility and transform 
our system into one of reform.

Generalizing that all white people are racist is reductive, harmful
Quist must gain focus
Justice system neglects prisoners’ agency, futures
BRANDON SCHMUCK
A few weeks ago, I took a stand on 
reverse racism in dating preferences 
and the criticism that a number of 
people receive when expressing al-
ternative opinions on most college 
campuses. In response, my article 
was cited in not one but two articles 
in The Tartan. I am happy to open 
up a debate and value the opinions 
shared, and there were a number 
of topics that I think are worth ad-
dressing in this week’s Outcry on 
Overheard.
In her article, “Racial dating 
preferences are racist, reduce en-
tire groups to race,” Ruth Scherr 
described my original article in a 
way that made it sound like bigotry 
brewed from a “privileged” white 
man who grew up in Trump coun-
try. She refers to my beliefs as my 
“personal bigotry” and even states, 
“Wanting respect for the idea that 
racial preferences aren’t racist is like 
wanting respect for the belief that 
the earth is ?at.” The fact that Scherr 
brings ?at Earthers like Dr. Shaquille 
O’Neal, who stated last month, “So, 
listen, I drive from coast to coast, and 
this s*** is ?at to me,” into this argu-
ment is offensive.
This is closed-minded dialog that 
will spell the end of America if we al-
low it to persist. Don’t get me wrong, 
I don’t condone racism. I will do all 
that I can to ?ght it when a true act 
of racism occurs. I am not convinced 
that racial dating preferences are a 
true act of racism, and I am not con-
vinced that calling someone a bigot 
for having them brings forth a pro-
ductive argument.
If marginalizing races in dating 
preferences is racism, is marginal-
izing sexes in dating preferences 
sexism? Does the fact that I’m only 
attracted to women make me sex-
ist against men? Does the fact that a 
homosexual is only attracted to their 
own sex make them sexist towards 
the opposite sex? No, this would be 
an absurd statement to make and 
goes against the laws of nature. We 
can’t control our sexual preferences. 
People are attracted to various traits, 
as I stated in my previous article, and 
this attraction is rooted in a subcon-
scious level.
In “White people must acknowl-
edge inherent racism, privilege,” 
Lydia Green states that, “A white 
person with a ‘thing for Asian chicks’ 
may ostensibly be attracted to Asian 
women because of their physical 
characteristics, but the why of it 
doesn’t change the fact that this type 
of fetishism adds to the oppression 
of Asian women.” What Green fails 
to state is the fact that racial dating 
preferences are a two-way street, and 
as I stated in my original article, it’s 
not just white people having them. If 
you are going to call out racial dating 
preferences, call out all races.
Green calls it our duty as white 
“racists” to “invite people of color 
into white spaces of authority with 
open arms.” She states, “We must 
appreciate everything that people of 
color do for us and for themselves” 
and “make them feel cared about.” 
In my opinion, differential treatment 
of people based on skin color is an 
impediment to ending racism. In or-
der to end racism, we must create an 
environment where everyone is wel-
come and treated equally and fairly 
and skin color has no bearing on the 
way we treat others.
Anyone quali?ed should be wel-
come in “spaces of authority with 
open arms.” We should acknowledge 
that some people have it harder than 
others and do all that we can to ?ght 
racism, but calling out an entire race 
because society contains racial bar-
riers is not the answer to solving 
the problem. This simply marginal-
izes people further and, in my opin-
ion, is just as racist as the barriers 
themselves.
In the process of destroying rac-
ism in the modern era, we must 
prevent ourselves from turning our 
world into an inauthentic safe space. 
Isolating yourself from the noise 
does not take it away. Scherr states, 
“whether or not this university is in 
a political bubble doesn’t matter.” If 
we refer to the 2016 election, we can 
see just how much it matters that this 
university is a political bubble. Walk-
ing through campus last fall, Clinton 
appeared to have the election by a 
long shot. On election night, we re-
alized just how much of a bubble we 
created around ourselves when the 
nation selected the man that we were 
too busy meme-ing and insulting to 
draw attention towards.
Regardless of whether or not you 
support him, Trump’s victory brings 
to the forefront many of the issues 
currently facing this nation. People 
are sick of being censored by politi-
cal correctness. They are tired of be-
ing afraid of insulting someone with 
every statement they make, and they 
chose to express this by electing the 
man who was the ?aming dumpster 
during election season. While I ac-
knowledge that racism is a reality, 
and I oppose the statements made 
by Trump, why are we wasting our 
energy calling out things that aren’t 
racist until we tire the nation out of 
being politically correct?
I ?nd it ironic that the people who 
decry racism the loudest often create 
some of the most racist messages. Are 
all white people really privileged? I’ll 
acknowledge that based on my back-
ground, I have some privilege that 
others do not. I personally believe 
that everyone in this university has.
However, to say that a poor, white 
teenager overdosing on heroin in a 
dying coal town is more privileged 
than a minority at a top tier universi-
ty with a bright road ahead is just ut-
terly ridiculous. In my opinion, your 
background — which is often tied to 
race but does not always have a one-
to-one correspondence — de?nes 
your privilege more than skin color.
We must create a world devoid 
of racism, but crying wolf is not the 
solution. Generalizing an entire race 
as racist or denouncing sexual pref-
erences as racist are counterproduc-
tive to the cause of destroying racism 
and only throw gasoline on the ?re.
As members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community, we all carry a certain 
amount of privilege. We all have a 
duty to end racism, to call out any 
case of it which we see clearly hap-
pening, and to ensure that skin color 
does not limit opportunities.
However, racism is a two-way 
highway. We can’t simply make as-
sumptions about people based on 
their skin color (majority or mi-
nority), and we need to stop act-
ing like we know what people have 
been through just because of their 
appearance.

Genetic risk for second cancer in pediatric patients
Scientists now believe 
there is a genetic component 
to account for the higher risk 
of childhood cancer survi-
vors getting a second cancer 
later in life. When research-
ers examined data from 3,007 
childhood cancer survivors, 
they found that 11.5 percent 
of them carry genetic muta-
tions in at least one of the 156 
genes the researched look at.
On April 3, the research-
ers presented their ?ndings 
at a meeting for the Ameri-
can Association of Cancer 
Research. Of the survivors 
they examined, a third had 
had childhood leukemia; by 
age 45, 20 percent had devel-
oped new tumors on the skin, 
breast, or thyroid. Some were 
due to effects of chemothera-
py or radiation therapy. Of the 
156 genes examined, there 
exists a subset of 60 genes in 
which a single mutation is 
highly likely to lead to cancer; 
6 percent of the survivors had 
mutations in these 60 genes.
Genetic counseling is now 
advised if a second cancer 
develops for these patients. 
“This is a nice ?rst step,” says 
David Malkin, a pediatric on-
cologist at the University of 
Toronto. “The results validate 
the thoughts of those of us 
who believe there is a genetic 
risk that increases the risk of 
second malignancies.”

Pesticides found in Iowa tap water
Pesticides have long been 
controversial. For the ?rst 
time, traces of insecticide in 
the form of neonicotinoid 
chemicals have been discov-
ered in tap water in Iowa, in 
a study published in the Jour-
nal of Environmental Science 
& Technology Letters.
Despite treatment, the 
level of chemicals was discov-
ered to remain constant. With 
various types of ?ltration, it 
was discovered that 0.24 to 
57.3 nanograms of individual 
neonicotinoids per liter re-
mained. While it is currently 
unknown whether the chemi-
cals will have harmful effects 
relating to human health, the 
uncertainty that goes along 
with chemical treatment is 
what makes this discovery 
a large setback for pesticide 
use.
Neonicotinoids were origi-
nally used as a seed coating 
for crops, harmful to insects 
but not other species. “Based 
on some of the literature that 
has been published, the nitro 
group has the potential to be 
removed in the ?ltration pro-
cesses and that is the group 
that confers the selectivity

Atmosphere is de-
tected around planet
An astronomy team at 
Keele University in England 
has recently discovered an 
atmosphere surrounding an 
Earth-like planet. The planet 
is called GJ 1132b, residing 
in the southern constellation 
Vela.
Dr. John Southworth, who 
led the team, said, “While 
this is not the detection of 
life on another planet, it’s an 
important step in the right 
direction: the detection of an 
atmosphere around the su-
per-Earth GJ 1132b marks the 
?rst time that an atmosphere 
has been detected around an 
Earth-like planet other than 
Earth itself.”
The team consist-
ed of researchers from 
Keele University, the Max 
Planck Institute for Astronomy 
(MPIA, Germany), and the 
University of Cambridge. To 
take images of the planet 
and its host star, GJ 1132, the 
team used a GROND imager 
telescope at the 2.2 m ESO/
MPG in Chile. The research-
ers examined the planet at 
seven wavelengths, detecting 
decreases in brightness as the 
planet absorbed light from 
the host star. This discovery 
makes the planet a high pri-
ority for powerful telescopes 
like the Hubble Space Tele-
scope to examine further.

Carnegie Mellon develops new carbon dioxide emission index
SCITECH BRIEFS
Carnegie Mellon has collaborated with Mitsubishi Hitachi 
Power Systems to design and create a new index to evaluate 
the carbon emission levels of US energy companies.
The Carnegie Mellon Power Sector Carbon Index was 
revealed March 28 during Carnegie Mellon’s Energy Week 
2017. The release of the index was intended to contribute 
to this year’s Energy Week discussions, as its contents were 
of great interest to the hundreds of energy scientists and 
power industry leaders and innovators in attendance at En-
ergy Week.
The index contains data on the carbon footprints of vari-
ous electric companies in the United States. It compares the 
footprint data of each company to each other in addition to 
emissions data from past years. It also includes an online 
component, which includes supplemental data and projec-
tions for future emission and carbon footprint trends.
According to the university, “the index will provide poli-
cymakers, regulators, utilities, industry analysts, and the 
public with a source of objective information on overall 
emissions across the United States electric power grid.” 
The data presented in the index is important information 
to have as the United States slowly heads toward building 
a future with more reliable and sustainable power sources 
— the index will help determine whether any progress is 
being made. And, aif progress is being made, the index will 
help determine how signi?cant such progress is.
Paul Browning, a Mitsubishi executive and Carnegie Mel-
lon graduate, states that “As the power sector continues to 
evolve, the Carnegie Mellon Power Sector Carbon Index 
will provide useful insights into progress the power sector 
is making to safeguard the environment while meeting the 
nation’s energy demand.”
The Carnegie Mellon Power Sector Carbon Index can be 
viewed at emissionsindex.org.

CMU scientists looking for safer seizure suppression
NAVIYA SINGLA
Assistant SciTech Editor
An epileptic seizure is 
caused when there is abnor-
mal and excessive amounts 
of brain activity. The seizure 
is basically a sudden burst 
brain activity from a collec-
tion of brain cells, which cre-
ates a very high energy wave 
that affects the brain and the 
immediate surrounding tis-
sue. The effects of an epilep-
tic seizure are varied. While 
some can be mild or con-
trolled, others can manifest 
themselves as uncontrollable 
jerking movements, excrutiat-
ing pain, extreme exhaustion, 
and momentary loss of aware-
ness.
Proneness to seizures may 
result from a variety brain 
disorders or diseases that in-
crease the probability of there 
being a seizure (epilepsy), but 
can also be a product of drug 
use, brain trauma, very high 
body temperature, low blood 
sugar, and low body oxygen 
levels. According to the Carn-
egie Mellon University press 
release of this research, pa-
tients of epilepsy often reduce 
the impact of their seizures or 
suppress them by taking med-
ication, avoiding triggers, and 
adhering to a speci?ed diet, 
among other practices. Some-
times, patients whose seizures 
are harder to control or be-
come exceedingly dif?cult to 
handle can choose to undergo 
surgery to have certain por-
tions of their cortex removed 
or have neurotransmitters 
implanted there. These pro-
cedures, though often bene?-
cial, are quite invasive.
Maysam Chamanzar, a pro-
fessor of electrical and com-
puter engineering at Carnegie 
Mellon University, Reza Alam, 
a professor of mechanical 
engineering at University of 
California, Berkeley, and Ben 
Zhang, a Ph.D. student at Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley 
recently published a paper 
in the Journal of the Royal 
Society Interface. The paper 
explains an alternative meth-
od to suppress seizures in a 
non-invasive way. The meth-
od uses Anderson localiza-
tion, where a wave phenom-
enon occurs in the absence 
of waves in a disordered me-
dium. According to the press 
release, Chamanzar explains 
this phenomenon as similar 
to the way ocean waves lose 
energy when they move over 
a random and irregular to-
pography. This phenomenon 
is applicable to all waves, in-
cluding large optical waves or 
fast-moving light waves, and 
was discovered in a solid-state 
physics base context by Nobel 
laureate P.W. Anderson.
In the paper, Chamanzar 
and his colleagues aim to 
prove the validity of using 
this phenomenon with brain 
waves. They hypothesize that 
if one considers that seizures 
are a synchronized set of brain 
waves that propagate across 
the brain surface, then, one 
can ideally attempt to disrupt 
this spread by locally modu-
lating neurons hypotheti-
cally using a phased array of 
ultrasound transducers. This 
would create several nodes, 
which disrupt the spread of 
the brain waves that cause 
the seizure by making them 
lose energy. The team expects 
to test this procedure by hav-
ing patients wear a head de-
vice in the form of a cap or a 
headset that would launch a 
random pattern of ultrasound 
waves when a seizure onset 
was detected. This method is 
especially signi?cant because 
it is an immediate and non-
invasive response to a seizure.
HOW THINGS WORK
Use of foveal desriptors help improve facial recognition
JOSH ANDAH
SciTech Editor
Deva Ramanan, an asso-
ciate professor of robotics at 
Carnegie Mellon, and Peiyun 
Hu, a Ph.D. robotics student, 
recently developed an im-
proved method for detecting 
multiple faces in a crowd. The 
feat of distinguishing small 
objects is one challenge in 
computer vision, which is why 
Ramanan and Hu’s achieve-
ment is so crucial.
The method they devel-
oped uses “foveal descrip-
tors.” Just as the human brain 
cause the eye to focus on an 
object and blur the peripheral 
vision, so does this method, 
which allows a computer 
to process speci?c pixels in 
search of facial features.
The team also developed 
speci?c detectors for different 
sized faces. For example, a de-
tector was made to ?nd faces 
a few pixels across, while an-
other focused on faces with 
much higher resolution.
Improved computer vi-
sion has many bene?ts. Self-
driving cars need exceptional 
vision to avoid accidents, and 
at high speeds the images 
they process may be slightly 
blurred. Agencies like the 
Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion could use improved face 
detection to better identify 
suspects, even if the only im-
ages available are from a 
grainy closed-circuit televi-
sion feed. Ramanan and Hu’s 
developments may offer a so-
lution.
Computer vision is argu-
ably one of the fastest grow-
ing ?elds in computer sci-
ence. Today, phones like the 
Samsung S8 use facial and iris 
detection to restrict access. 
A use of face detection many 
of us are familiar with is in 
Snapchat ?lters, which ?nd 
and distort faces. Another 
well known use is in tagging 
on Facebook. Facebook runs a 
program that detects when a 
face in an image has not been 
tagged. It is also capable of 
pattern-matching like faces to 
generate tag suggestions.
The science behind face 
detection is even more fasci-
nating. Analysis of millions of 
images has enabled computer 
scientists to determine the av-
erage features of the human 
face, such as dark regions 
around the nose bridge and 
under the eyebrows. Com-
puters detect these features 
in pixel color values to detect 
a face. Unfortunately, this 
method makes it dif?cult to 
detect a face if it’s not facing 
the camera head-on.
Ramanan compares the 
feat of face detection in a crow 
to “spotting a toothpick in 
someone’s hand.” Ramanan 
and Hu’s complete publica-
tion, titled “Finding Tiny Fac-
es,” is available online.

Carnegie Mellon math team wins ?rst place at Putnam
YIYUAN CHEN
Operations Manager
In the 77th William 
Lowell Putnam Mathemati-
cal Competition (known as 
“Putnam”), the Carnegie Mel-
lon team, led by Professor 
Po-Shen Loh, won the ?rst 
place for the ?rst time in his-
tory, beating top schools such 
as Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT), Princ-
eton University, and Harvard 
University. This is the sixth 
consecutive year that Carn-
egie Mellon ranked top ?ve in 
the competition, with second 
most number of undergradu-
ate student in the top 500 
competitors. 
More than 150 Carnegie 
Mellon students participated 
in the competition Decem-
ber 3, 2016. Over 4000 com-
petitors from 568 institutes in 
North America participated in 
the contest. Putnam is widely 
recognized as the most presti-
gious undergraduate compe-
tition in the world, with the 
median score of 0 or 1 out 
of 120. Students are asked 
to solve 12 complex math 
problem by using knowledge 
taught in undergraduate 
math courses. To place in the 
top ?ve and become a Putnam 
Fellow often requires a score 
of over 100, and to be in the 
top 500 requires a score of 28 
this year.
The competition results re-
leased last week showed that 
Carnegie Mellon students 
claimed 44 out of the top 517 
spots. The Carnegie Mellon 
winning team includes junior 
mathematical science ma-
jor Joshua Brakensiek, who 
placed ?rst in the competi-
tion, and senior mathemati-
cal science major Thomas 
Swayze, and senior mathe-
matical science major Samuel 
Zbarsky. Carnegie Mellon also 
claimed three out of the top 
?ve competitors. The last time 
any team had all three com-
petitors in the top ?ve was in 
1990 at Harvard University. 
Po-Shen Loh, who led the 
Carnegie Mellon team and 
taught Putnam Seminar in the 
fall, began teaching at Carne-
gie Mellon University in 2010 
after graduating from Princ-
eton University. In addition to 
being an associate professor 
in mathematical sciences, Loh 
is also the national lead coach 
of USA Math International 
Olympiad Team since 2013, 
and was an instructor and 
leader at the USA Math Olym-
piad Summer Program. An 
excellent mathematician and 
enthusiastic teacher, Loh has 
transformed the landscape 
of the mathematical scienc-
es department of Carnegie 
Mellon. He not only recruit-
ed “mathletes” through the 
Knaster-McWilliams Scholars 
program, but also heightened 
the interest in mathematics 
within Carnegie Mellon. 
Before 2011, Carnegie 
Mellon had not been ranked 
top ?ve in the Putnam com-
petition since 1987. “When I 
came here seven years ago, I 
thought [Carnegie Mellon] 
should be one of those ?ve 
teams,” said Loh. In 2011, 
2013 and 2015, Carnegie Mel-
lon team placed second in the 
competition, and place ?fth 
in 2012 and 2014. This year’s 
result signi?ed the fruition 
of Loh’s and the participants’ 
hard work. 
In his post on Overheard 
at Carnegie Mellon, Loh 
thanked everyone at Carnegie 
Mellon. “Thank you for being 
awesome,” Loh wrote, “even 
people who didn’t take the 
Putnam. You all contribute to 
the creative atmosphere that 
support us all.”
Classifying alien civilizations with the Kardashev scale
JOSH ANDAH
SciTech Editor
There is a great deal of 
energy available to humans 
— unthinkable amounts of 
energy. But, we’ve barely 
tapped into it. Saying we have 
scratched the surface of en-
ergy harvesting is a gross over-
statement. 
The sun, for example, pro-
duces well over a quadrillion 
(thousand trillion) joules of 
energy every second. To put 
that number into perspective, 
that’s more energy than our 
species has consumed in our 
entire existence.
At a time in modern history 
when our energy production 
and how it affects our climate 
are controversial, an interest-
ing thought experiment comes 
to mind: the Kardashev scale. 
In 1964, Soviet astronomer 
Nikolai Kardashev imagined 
intelligent civilizations strewn 
across the Universe with ca-
pabilities far beyond our own. 
The result of his musings, the 
Kardashev scale is, at its sim-
plest, an attempt to classify 
those civilizations in terms of 
intellectual and technological 
advancements.
There are three categories 
of this scale. The ?rst catego-
ry, and most primitive one, 
is a Type I civilization, also 
know as a planetary civiliza-
tion: A civilization that stores 
and uses only a percentage 
of the energy delivered by its 
host star. That’s the category 
our civilization falls into. We 
use some of the energy the 
sun delivers to the earth, be 
it directly in the form of solar 
light, or indirectly by burning 
fossil fuels or harvesting wind 
energy.
The next type is the Type II 
civilization. A Type II civiliza-
tion uses all the energy of its 
host star. For earth to be con-
sidered Type II, we would have 
consume all quadrillion joules 
the sun provides. 
The most likely way this can 
be achieved is with a Dyson 
sphere, a hollow sphere that 
encompasses the host star’s 
surface and transmits all emit-
ted energy to the civilization. 
It will be hard to ?nd such a 
civilization since its star’s light 
will be blocked by the sphere, 
limited the survival of life on 
the planet.
The last and most advanced 
civilization is a Type III civili-
zation, which harvests the en-
ergy of its entire galaxy. To un-
derstand how astonishing this 
is, realize that there are about 
a hundred billion stars in our 
own Milky Way, all producing 
as much or way more energy 
than our sun.
Type II and III civilizations 
would be far more advanced 
than us, in ways we could only 
imagine. It took only 200 years 
for us to ascend from horse-
drawn carriages to supersonic 
jets and autonomous vehicles. 
Imagine if a civilization had 
more time to exist and grow, 
say on the order of thousands 
or millions of years. 
It would outstrip our tech-
nology many times over, 
achieving things we have only 
dreamed of. 
Of course, given that some 
solar systems and exoplanets 
are billions of years older than 
our own, there is no limit.
Energy on Earth is a po-
litical pivot, solely because it 
is extremely scarce. Its geo-
political importance starts 
international wars, crashes 
economies, and advances our 
technology. 
However, energy is like 
any other product that follows 
supply-demand laws. With 
more of it, its price will di-
minish tremendously. Energy 
will begin to play less of a role 
in con?ict, because it simply 
won’t be as valuable anymore.
With more energy, devel-
opment in underprivileged 
communities will accelerate. 
More powerful transportation 
methods will be engineered, 
and humans will become a 
space-faring species. Powerful 
computers that can support 
arti?cial intelligence will be 
made. The possibilities are 
endless.
Perhaps, being a Type II or 
III civilization is in our future 
— that is, if the innovation 
never ceases. Until then, we 
will have to get by with our 
limited fossil fuels, hydroelec-
tric dams, and solar panels.

NBA title series no longer lock for Warriors and Cavaliers
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Contributing Editor
The NBA season draws to 
a close on Wednesday, and 
even with so few games left, 
questions remain about the 
postseason picture. That said, 
the end of a grueling 82-game 
basketball season leaves very 
little left to learn in the ?nal 
few games besides playoff 
seeding.
While that seeding will 
determine home court advan-
tage and can certainly swing 
games, the large number of 
possessions in a basketball 
game and the best-of-seven 
format in the playoffs mean 
that the best team usually 
hoists the Larry O’Brien tro-
phy come June.
This article will explore the 
top two teams in each confer-
ence’s reasons to believe and 
potential weaknesses going 
into the playoffs. It will also 
pick out two teams that could 
potentially play spoiler and 
surprise people with deep 
playoff runs.
Golden State Warriors
Reasons to believe: The 
Warriors have claimed the 
league’s best record in three 
consecutive seasons, but this 
team has been particularly 
devastating at its best. The 
Warriors had already won 
the NBA Finals and broke the 
regular season wins record in 
back-to-back seasons before 
they added forward Kevin 
Durant, easily one of the ?ve 
best players in the league. 
This team can create insane 
amounts of space with the 
shooting they get from Durant, 
reigning Most Valuable Player 
Stephen Curry, and guard 
Klay Thompson. Each of those 
guys can slice up a defense by 
themselves with that space, 
but coach Steve Kerr’s system 
keeps the ball ?ying around 
the court, ?nding open shoot-
ers and cutters and generally 
being a nightmare for oppos-
ing defenses. The Warriors 
boast the league’s top rated of-
fense per 100 possessions. In 
addition, Thompson, Durant, 
and forward Draymond Green 
are all excellent defenders 
who can guard multiple posi-
tions. Trying to attack the bas-
ket against the forest of limbs 
created by this team’s defen-
sive scheme is nearly impos-
sible, and the Warriors’ second 
best defensive rating per 100 
possessions adds statistical 
weight to that.
Potential weaknesses: 
Conventional wisdom says 
the Warriors’ Achilles heel is 
their rebounding, but they are 
an average team by rebound-
ing rate. While this certainly 
isn’t good come playoff time, 
it’s not the weakness it’s made 
out to be. Only three of the 
nine teams ahead of them will 
have home court advantage in 
the ?rst round of the playoffs, 
and only ?ve will make the 
playoffs at all. The weakness I 
see haunting this team is their 
penchant for turning the ball 
over. Golden State was the 
eighth worst team at protect-
ing the pumpkin this season 
and if they continuously have 
to run back in transition, it 
could wear out their rotation, 
which is thinner this year than 
in the past due to the salary 
dumping necessary after ac-
quiring Durant. This would 
massively mitigate the edges 
they have all over the ?oor 
against other teams.
Cleveland Cavaliers
Reasons to believe: The 
Cavaliers have one of the best 
rosters in the league. Forward 
LeBron James has been to the 
NBA Finals in each of the past 
six seasons on two different 
teams. That’s an insane streak, 
and James has put up another 
strong campaign this season. 
His athleticism and physi-
cal strength combined with 
his keen passing vision and 
basketball IQ make it nearly 
impossible to stop James 
from doing damage. James’ 
supporting cast is also star-
studded. Guard Kyrie Irving 
has a mesmerizing handle on 
the basketball and combines 
that with underrated strength 
to create space even against 
tight defense. His famous dag-
gers that have come at the 
Warriors’ expense are not a 
coincidence. Forward Kevin 
Love has also really grown into 
his role with the Cavaliers, hit-
ting three pointers consistent-
ly and crashing the glass, col-
lecting over 11 rebounds per 
game. Other role players pro-
vide everything from shooting 
to defense to a strong bench 
presence, making this a scary 
team on paper.
Potential weaknesses: The 
statistical case for the Cavs be-
ing the best team in the league 
is weak. This team is the third-
best offense in the league on a 
per possession basis, but only 
the 22nd best defensive team. 
They have little rim protec-
tion, and they can seem disen-
gaged or overmatched at times 
on the perimeter defensively 
when the other team moves 
the ball. The offensive ?re-
power of the Celtics, Wizards, 
and Raptors could prove to be 
an issue even before they get 
to the ?nals. They’re 19th by 
rebounding rate, and center 
Tristan Thompson has re-
gressed badly on the glass, 
often getting shoved around 
and ?nding himself out of 
position. His thumb injury on 
Tuesday could exacerbate this 
during the playoffs. Even the 
Cavaliers’ offense isn’t unas-
sailable, as turnovers have 
led to them giving up huge 
amounts of transition posses-
sions, which every team strug-
gles to defend. For the ?rst 
time in three years, a Warriors 
vs. Cavs ?nal only seems prob-
able, not inevitable.
Utah Jazz
Reasons to believe: Utah 
is three seasons into being the 
basketball nerd darlings, and 
this year they ?nally delivered 
on the potential we were prom-
ised. This team has everything 
a not-so-casual basketball fan 
could want: a deep, talented 
rotation; beautiful, complex 
sets composed by coach Quinn 
Snyder; fringe candidates for 
major end-of-season awards 
in forward Gordon Hayward 
and center Rudy Gobert; and 
a slow, deliberate style that 
lends itself to picking apart 
every single possession to un-
pack what exactly was going 
on. This team has the tools 
to ?nd itself in the Western 
Conference Finals or beyond 
should they play their best bas-
ketball. Their starting rotation 
features ?ve strong defenders 
who can guard multiple posi-
tions, giving them the ability 
to switch screens that has be-
come so en vogue in the past 
few seasons. Gobert, their de-
fensive anchor and potential 
Defensive Player of the Year, is 
a solid rim protector who uses 
his leaping ability and length 
to snuff out basically every-
thing at the rim. The result 
has been the NBA’s third best 
rated defense per 100 posses-
sions. Offensively, this roster is 
loaded with excellent passers 
from guard George Hill to for-
wards Joe Johnson and Boris 
Diaw who come off the bench. 
However, it’s Hayward’s abil-
ity to put the ball in the basket 
from anywhere on the ?oor in 
nearly any situation that al-
lows this offense to be more 
than just an intricate Rube 
Goldberg machine. The Jazz 
are a middling offensive team, 
but in the playoffs where Hay-
ward will get increased atten-
tion from opposing teams, he 
has shown he has the skills to 
thrive in that environment.
Potential weaknesses: With 
the exception of Hayward’s 
scoring and Gobert’s rim runs, 
this team doesn’t have a ton of 
ways to put the ball in the bas-
ket. Often times, it seems like 
the ball is moving around from 
player to player with no clear 
goal and a beautiful posses-
sion ends with a rushed chuck 
towards the hoop before the 
shot clock ends. Hayward is 
not a particularly successful 
isolation scorer, meaning that 
the ball movement is their 
best way to put up points, but 
in crunch time, it would be 
much nicer to have a fallback 
option. That could cause them 
headaches in the playoffs that 
could even get them bounced 
in round one by the Clippers.
Toronto Raptors
Reasons to believe: This 
team just went on a dominant 
stretch without guard Kyle 
Lowry, their second best play-
er and a cornerstone in both 
their offense and defense. 
Their best player, however, is 
guard DeMar DeRozan, whose 
incredibly precise footwork 
makes him a handful to guard 
and allows him to uncork 
thirty- and forty-point games 
when he’s on. The Raptors are 
the only team in the Eastern 
Conference who are rated in 
the top ten in both offensive 
and defensive ef?ciency. This 
includes the portion of the 
season before they acquired 
forward Serge Ibaka, who 
has been a strong presence on 
both sides of the ball, and PJ 
Tucker, their best one-on-one 
defender on the wing. This 
team is deep with talent and 
has a bevy of ways to score and 
stop the other team from scor-
ing. If their perimeter players 
can’t ?nd a shot, center Jo-
nas Valanciunas hasn’t been 
the destructive force posting 
up he was in years past, but 
he provides a decent safety 
valve. Pairing him with Ibaka 
has been successful since both 
players operate in different 
parts of the ?oor, giving the 
other one the room to deliver 
the damage they need to. De-
fensively, the Raptors don’t 
have the ability to switch on 
screens that other teams do, 
but they have many talented 
on-ball defenders that make it 
hard to get away from any de-
fender that easily.
Potential weaknesses: 
DeRozan’s lack of three point 
range con?nes him to the 
midrange shot, which can be 
inef?cient even in his capable 
hands. This can clog up the 
?oor for everyone else and 
sometimes the Raptors just 
don’t ?nd the space neces-
sary for good looks, prevent-
ing their offense from being 
a dominant force like the 
Warriors or Cavaliers. Defen-
sively, their versatility is dif?-
cult to match up with but their 
rigid roles can be exploited. 
This is a hard defensive team 
to beat, but forests of screens 
can short circuit it.
The NBA Finals has seen 
the same two teams play in 
in the past two years, and the 
current standings would point 
to a third straight year of Cavs 
vs. Warriors. However, both 
the East and West boast con-
tenders that simply weren’t 
assembled last year, and we 
might see someone new break 
into the Finals for the ?rst time 
since 2015.

On marriage and talking to relatives
Dear Ruth,
Coming in to Carnegie Mellon, I was convinced 
that medicine was my destiny. It was the perfect 
path for me considering my love for helping 
people, cutting things up, and having a viable 
career. The plan was to be financially independent 
by my mid-twenties, and to be on the cover of 
all the cardiologist magazines by the age of 35. 
But alas, I took on the premed classes and found 
myself grasping at straws. I struggled to find 
value beyond the prospects of the future, and thus 
diverted myself to an alternative path: one of free 
expression, and independence.
Now, my goal is to take some time to find myself 
after I graduate, with a more indefinite career 
path, something that I would expect my relatives 
to be weary of, right? WRONG.
I went home to visit family a couple weeks 
ago, and found myself nervously explaining my 
situation to a relative of mine. I was prepared 
to defend myself with explanations of my hopes 
and dreams, and was instead met by a completely 
different monster: a sigh of relief. “Oh wonderful! 
We were worried sick. Now you have the flexibility 
to get married before you’re 27.”
How is one expected to respond to THAT? Do I 
want to get married? I have no idea right now. Do 
I think I’ll be financially stable by the age of 27? 
There’s really no way of knowing. I feel sick to my 
stomach. Right now, it seems like the only  
magazine I’ll be on the cover of is Cosmo, as some 
sort of trophy wife. How do I tell my family that I 
don’t really wanted to think about marriage?
Please help,
Super Into Not Getting Literally Engaged 
Dear SINGLE,
When I started reading your question, I was 
honestly expecting the quandary to be “how do I 
explain to my relatives that I don’t want to go to 
med school without them trying to push me toward 
being the typical hyper-successful perfect child.” 
I’m actually a little blindsided that the problem is 
your family is okay with your “career” change.
Well. That’s not really the problem, though. 
Because it’s actually pretty great that your 
relatives are cool with your new plan to take time 
and find yourself — the problem is that they’re 
trying to tell you what you should do with that 
time. Specifically, that you should get married. If 
it had been anything else, like “Now you have 
the flexibility to publish a book,” or “climb a 
mountain,” or even “sit on your parents’ couch for 
five years,” it’d still be frustrating — anyone telling 
you what you should or shouldn’t do with your life 
always is — but the expectation that marriage is 
what should be in your plan has an extra added 
bonus of sexism to make it even worse. The fact 
that women are STILL fighting the expectation that 
their ultimate goal should be marriage frustrates 
me too no end.
I fully recognize that there are some people (yes, 
including women) out there who actively want to 
be married. They’ve wanted it for as long as they 
can remember, and having a fulfilling marriage is 
what they want from their life. There’s absolutely 
nothing wrong with that — it’s just not what you 
want.
So how do you tell your family, aka people you 
can’t avoid, that marriage isn’t what you’re aiming 
for and that it frustrates you when they presume 
that it is and should be? Well, this is going to be 
annoyingly simple: you either tell them or you 
don’t. Unless you have some special undisclosed 
circumstances, they can’t force you to marry. It’s 
possible they’ll figure it out eventually even if you 
don’t explain.
I think you should try telling them, though. It 
may take a couple tries, but you’re an adult, you 
can explain your reasoning and thoughts. You’ll 
probably have to do it a couple of times — and 
there’s definitely a point where you should give 
it up as a hopeless case and just talk about the 
weather — but if it keeps coming up then that’s 
the way to handle it. It doesn’t have to be a 10 
minute treatise with citations and evidence, just a 
comment. Think “Oh, I’m not really interested in 
marriage right now and I think it’s a better use of 
my time to make plans for things I actually want.”
Best of luck,
Ruth
Zeke Rosenberg | Contributing EditorBar Buddies: Le Mardi Gras
Old school and dimly lit, with drinks strong enough to hold you down
This week, we decided to move back closer to 
campus. We ended up at Le Mardi Gras just off 
Walnut St.
The location: Just off Walnut is a nice place for 
a bar since there are multiple places on Walnut 
open until 2 a.m. Post-bar grub is a huge benefit 
and Stack’d, The Yard, and Steel Cactus will keep 
you fed well into the night. 
Walnut, as we’ve mentioned before, is also pretty 
easy to get to. The 75 and 71B and D will get you 
there from Oakland and Shadyside, while the 64 
will bring you from Squirrel Hill, and it’s a doable 
walk from campus.
The drinks: I ordered a whiskey sour and Ariel 
ordered a … margarita? Not only did Ariel order 
a margarita at a smoke-filled dive bar, but it was 
the most gourmet margarita in human history, 
coming with fresh-squeezed lime juice. They 
have a pretty extensive list of drinks they make, 
so no matter what your drink of choice is, you 
will probably find it here. The fact that they will 
squeeze the juice at the bar is an added bonus.
The drinks were good and were also really strong. 
I’m not kidding about that, be careful and go 
slowly when drinking here. They weren’t cheap, 
clocking in around the cost of most well drinks at 
nearby bars. This being Walnut St., that is quite 
expensive, but there aren’t many better options 
nearby for cost effectiveness. A quick heads-up; 
you’re going to want to stop by the ATM a block 
away, since this bar is cash-only.
The vibe: Le Mardi Gras is a true dive bar. I’m 
fairly certain the only lights are the televisions 
and a neon sign detailing happy hour deals. 
Other than that, the bar is really dark. The dark 
hides what I assume is a massive cloud of smoke 
lingering over all of the patrons. Smoking is 
allowed in this bar, and whether that is a good or 
bad thing by your count, you will leave smelling 
heavily of smoke. For days. 
The bar can get crowded, and the cozy looking 
booths that dot one side of the bar were 
completely full when we went on a Thursday. This 
makes for some close quarters at the bar, but 
that’s to be expected when a bar is at capacity.
The bar seems to have an old school theme going, 
with a juke box in the back with a pretty extensive 
selection of music and a Pac-Man table near the 
front. It’s not a place to bring a large group of 
friends, but it’s a fun night out with a buddy where 
you can have a couple drinks and the drunken 
cigarette you might be craving without anyone 
judging you.
Lit or nah: Le Mardi Gras is quite literally not lit, 
seeing as there are no lights. On the other hand, 
strong drinks, Pac-Man, and the setup with booths 
and the dark make this bar a place you can spend 
a few hours with a friend or two, which is lit.

Visual and performance art ignites new understanding in campus community
With so many different challenges to face in 
today’s world, we as a community should take 
the time every now and then to reflect, to let 
others within and outside our community know 
that we are here to support and care for one 
another. Events like Friday’s Spark the Movement 
Showcase give us that kind of opportunity to 
reconnect and shine light on pressing issues 
and topics that are very relevant to us in our 
current society.
The showcase was a project by fifth-year scholar 
Rachel Freer, who has always seen art as a pow-
erful way to communicate messages on some 
of the most sensitive topics of our time. Subjects 
like mental health, ethnicity, and feminism (just to 
name a few) were represented in the visual and 
performance art pieces created by students from 
all over the university. The hour and a half long 
event was surely a great way of allowing more 
voices to be heard in the community, and a way 
of embracing the diversity on campus.
Before the live performances, visitors were able to 
view pieces of visual artwork made by students, 
which focused on topics related to self-identity 
and gender. The depiction of these concepts in 
the students’ works were very genuine and hon-
est. For example, one of the pieces was a collec-
tion of photos that responded to society’s view of 
women’s fashion, while another was a self por-
trait of a student whose cultural heritage was the 
focus of the piece. Displaying all the artwork at 
the very front of the room helped make clear that 
the primary intention of the event was to create a 
comfortable and safe space for everyone.
The student performances were equally mov-
ing, and certainly left the audience feeling 
inspired at the end. The first performance, 
titled “Finding Your 
Power,” was 
by Carnegie Mellon’s female a cappella group, 
Counterpoint, in which they they sang two songs 
that focused on empowering all women and 
building the confidence to stand up for the equal 
treatment everyone deserves. The talented group 
clearly put a lot of emotion and soul into their 
performance, which helped them successfully get 
their message across to the audience.
The second performance was a dance piece titled 
“The Edge of It,” choreographed by Michaelina 
McGee, a senior political science major at 
Chatham University, that portrayed the challenges 
that come with a mental illness like depression. 
The dancing in this performance was beautiful 
and provided a very liberating experience for 
everyone in the room. The purpose of this piece 
was to raise awareness of 
mental illness, and to help 
others better understand 
the difficult situations 
people are dealing 
with but may not be 
very vocal about. 
Throughout the 
event, there were 
several other inspir-
ing dance and song 
performances, as well 
as a few incredible 
spoken word pieces.
The entire show exhib-
ited a different aspect 
of the culture on 
campus. Oftentimes, 
we as students get 
so busy and over-
whelmed by our work that we don’t even notice 
those around us. The diversity in culture, ethnicity, 
sexuality, and talent are what really shape the 
community at Carnegie Mellon. This event helped 
the audience realize how much more there is to 
learn about the people campus. If you’re inter-
ested in seeing the event, click on the following

“It’s man versus monster, and 
the monster always wins.”
Perhaps one 
of the best ways 
to spend a Friday 
night is, surprisingly, 
in a cold warehouse. 
Why? For a theatrical 
performance. Upon enter-
ing the Quantum location, 
strings with dull filament lightbulbs 
hang overhead and plastic drapes 
over various walls and over the seat-
ing structure. The space feels inherently 
secret. The set hints to the absurd and sur-
real nature of the coming play; chairs hang 
upside down on the wall, picture-less picture 
frames hang tilted, and another chair floats nearby, 
looming over the set for someone to sit in and watch.
Quantum Theatre’s Collaborators hones in on a story 
about artistic freedom, politics, and family. The black com-
edy tells the story of Russian playwright Mikhail Bulgakov, who 
is given the ultimatum of writing a celebratory play for Joseph 
Stalin’s birthday in order to save his own censored play. The story 
is mostly true sans occasional twists of the surreal as visions of Stalin 
dance about in Bulgakov’s head — and chase him about with a typewriter 
with comedic music blasting in the background. Shifting from hilarious to 
absolutely menacing, the play highlights quirky, sometimes caricature like char-
acters. Truly, the dark humor sucks you right in. At some points, I stopped taking 
notes for the review because I could not stop laughing. The humor exists both on the 
grand scale and the tiniest detail. However, the comedy cannot survive in this play’s 
world forever as the threat of political terrorism and fascism becomes all consuming.
Carnegie Mellon School of Drama’s own Jed Allen Harris was drawn back to Quantum to 
direct this particularly timely play. After all, with the current threat to the National Endowment 
of the Arts, Collaborators begins to take form as a terrifying reflection in a present mirror. “How 
much of your artistic soul will you sell to save your artistic soul?” asks Harris, framing the play in a 
dilemma that has tormented artists from Stalinist Russia to present day America. Susan Tsu, professor of 
costume design in the School of Drama, joins Harris in his mission to bring this show to life with costumes 
rich in texture: leather, fur, and fabric soaked through with blood.
On a campus arguing about Make America Great Again hats on Overheard, censorship and fascism are  
hot-button topics. If one is looking to venture into Pittsburgh and experience thought-provoking, comedic, and some-
times terrifying art, then Quantum’s Collaborators is a viable nighttime adventure for a curious theatergoer. Student 
tickets are 18 dollars when called for ahead of time. The play runs until April 30.

CMU’s Greek community bands together to raise money for Camp Kesem through a night of dancing and singing
NEVER BUILT CMU
The addition of the Tepper Quad is set to completely change the way 
in which students, faculty, and outsiders perceive and experience 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus. Already, the construction on Forbes 
Avenue has transformed the way in which members of the campus 
community interact with the space. Once it opens, the Tepper Quad 
will serve as a new entrance to our campus. It will represent us as a 
university and as a community to all those who visit. However, not all 
ambitious projects at Carnegie Mellon like the Tepper Quad have been 
realized. Many visions for the modern landscape of Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus have been laid out and rendered, but ultimately rejected due 
to various complications. The idea of a Carnegie Mellon completely 
different to the eclectic scenery we know and (maybe) love struck 
us as quite an interesting idea. Pictured are drawings, sketches, and 
other documentation of Carnegie Mellon building prospects. This is a 
Carnegie Mellon campus that never was. 
Historically, most of the built additions to Carnegie Mellon’s campus 
have tended to work in agreement with the original campus designed 
in 1900-1910 by Henry Hornbostel. Despite being built in the last half 
century or so, the Cohon Center, Purnell Center, Posner Hall, West Wing 
House, Resnik House, Newell-Simon Hall, The Collaborative Innovation 
Center, and the additions to Doherty Hall are all designed to it in with 
the university’s original 1910 yellow brick aesthetic. Despite the cutting 
edge nature of much of Carnegie Mellon’s work and the modernity 
of our campus community, the architecture of our campus is largely 
tailored to match a style that is more than a century old. 
Just a few years ago, the addition of the Gates Hillman Complex had 
a huge impact on the way that members of the community and visitors 
perceive Carnegie Mellon. It completely changed the work environment 
for all the members of the School of Computer Science and several 
others who now use Gates as a place to study. It has become a hub 
of campus life, and many, if not most, of us would be hard pressed 
to imagine Carnegie Mellon without it. However, the Gates Hillman 
Complex did more than just change the campus dynamic. It also played 
an invaluable role in bringing the university into the 21st century. It 
injected a fresh sense of modernity and cutting edge design into an 
environment populated by largely historical works of architecture.

Brutalism
There are some buildings on our campus that 
have challenged the yellow brick vernacular. 
The Gates Hillman Complex, Scott Hall, Hunt 
Library, Wean Hall, Donner House, and Scaife 
Hall somehow managed to escape the steady 
encroachment of yellow brick and stand out as 
examples of the architecture of their time. These 
buildings represent a minority of modern design 
proposals that made it through the selection 
process and were realised.
It is curious that the unbuilt proposals shown 
here do not display the same characteristic 
yellow brick. Rather than blend in with the his-
toric style, they are each emblematic of their 
time. Had they been realised, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s campus would have been a very different 
place indeed.
Fortunately, the architecture of our campus 
is moving away from historical contextualism 
towards a more modern style that is more 
representative of our community and our times. 
The Gates Hillman Complex and Scott Hall 
stand out as symbols of the university’s progress 
and are emblematic of the community’s place in 
society, professionally and culturally. Despite its 
use of yellow brick, the Tepper Quad promises 
to continue this trend by creating spaces that 
will encourage the conluence of the diverse 
thoughts and ideas that make our campus and 
our community so special. If anything, the yellow 
brick on Tepper symbolizes our university’s 
connection to its heritage, while creating a new 
space where we can go boldly into the future.

Mattress Factory: “so it is”
New exhibits, renovations, and updates make room for social justice 
In a time of massive political strife and division — not just 
in the United States, but around the world — the Mattress 
Factory’s new exhibit, “so it is”, helps to unite the present 
day with history and to remind people of strength, opposi-
tion, and resistance through artistic expression.
Curated by John Carson, former Head of the School of 
Art at Carnegie Mellon University, “so it is” opened at 
the Mattress Factory on April 7 at their location on 1414 
Monterey Street. The exhibition is based around the works of 
seven Northern Irish artists whose early works were inspired 
from “The Troubles” of Northern Ireland, a series of political 
and religious conflicts between Northern Ireland’s Protestant 
Unionist population and its Catholic Nationalist population 
from 1968 to 1998.
In addition to featuring “so it is”, The Mattress Factory also 
spent months renovating their entire gallery. The gallery now 
features new permanent exhibits, such as a handrail featur-
ing aluminum troughs of running water, in a collaboration 
between the Mattress Factory and six artists; Bill Woodrow’s 
“Ship of Fools: Discovery in Time,” a kitchen “frozen in time” 
left in a dilapidated state; and a modern interpretation of 
Leonardo da Vinci’s “Vitruvian Man”. 
“so it is” makes the most of its space and embraces its inter-
activity, incorporating art into each room and using it to 
engage with others by educating them about the past. Rita 
Duffy’s “The Souvenir Shop” introduces that concept to visi-
tors as they walk in the gallery, serving not just as a function-
ing museum shop for the exhibit but also as its own part of 
the exhibition. Adapted last year in Dublin as a commentary 
on Irish politics and other social issues, “The Souvenir Shop” 
is mainly directed towards critiquing United States political 
issues, and showing how Irish and African American culture 
is intertwined in their fights for freedom. In “The Souvenir 
Shop,” Duffy shows “how people revisit time and places of 
the past for understanding the future.” The mass produce 
“grocery shop”-like aspect of the exhibit and each individual 
piece in it showcased the concept of how ideas were prod-
ucts, and how its purchase helped others to engage with 
modern ideas and social issues. Duffy was also influenced 
by aspects of Pittsburgh in her exhibit, as shown through the 
Andy Warhol-inspired Campbell’s soup cans and the bottles 
of hot sauce inspired by its location in Pittsburgh, and the 
Mexican War Street Districts.
Ursula Burke’s “The Precariat” also aimed to showcase 
the harsh reality of resistance of revolution through her 
mutilated and nearly-faceless busts. Her medium spoke 
volumes about her piece in general, using black porcelain 
to reference contemporary politics and the Black Lives 
Matter campaign. “Embroidery Frieze (The Politicians)” is

a mesmerizing, distorted display of current global politics, educating visitors while also serving as a display of 
contemporary issues.
As I continued through the rest of the exhibit, I found that each work of art was touched by political empower-
ment and passion, helping to kindle the drive for social justice in its visitors. Locky Morris’ “Untitled (tyre fire)” 
used a variety of mediums, including photography, to illuminate its work. While the photo was shot in Derry, 
Northern Ireland, the work is also reminiscent of Donald Trump’s proposed wall along the Mexican/United 
States border and its fire serves as a reminder of not only the failure of this wall but as a spark to empower 
social justice.
Paul Seawright also utilized photography in his installation “They Dropped Like Flakes, They Dropped Like Stars.” 
Seawright’s works are known for examining the impact of American troop deployment since 9/11 through the 
nature of conflict. In his latest photographic installation, Seawright “depicts the American city as a contested 
space that gives form to the fraying edges of American life,” highlighting the issues that American veterans face. 
Seawright’s use of photography succeeded in displaying the reality of the issue at hand, making the work poi-
gnant and the problems of American veterans all the more important.
Willie Doherty’s “No Return,” a video “set in a fictional future where the planet is slowly dying as a conse-
quence of pollution and climate change,” was one of the most interesting additions to the exhibition. Reminiscent 
of his earlier works, “Ghost Story,” “Buried,” and “Remains,” “No Return” analyzes “the relationship between 
landscape and memory.” Unlike the other works, “No Return” looks at the present to analyze the future, rather 
than remembering the past to change the future, and demonstrates an apprehensive fear about the future.
One of the most striking pieces of the exhibit was John Kindness’ “Dionysus.” Unlike the other works, Kindness’ 
lime fresco was inspired by the unity of Pittsburgh. In the artist’s statement of “Dionysus,” Kindness says “We may 
not all eat the same things but we all feel hunger. And there I no better way to unite strangers than by getting 
them to share a meal.” To acquire inspiration for his work he asked local Pittsburghers about what they like to 
eat, resulting in a lighthearted, vintage-looking, and fun work that brings a joy to people’s faces.
My parents often don’t understand modern art. But what I love about it is that while I may not understand the 
meaning of a work in greater detail, I know it carries a special meaning to the artist or even to another visitor. 
Throughout “so it is” I knew that each piece would be special to many people in millions of different ways, and I 
was so excited to see what that could bring. What made “so it is” even more special was how these seven artists 
came together to create an exhibit that stimulated the mind, empowered the soul, and reminded us of the past to 
inspire the future.

Caleb Miller | Staffwriterart by Paola Mathus | Staff Artist
A lone polar bear floating on a shrinking ice-
berg. Plumes of smoke billowing from a factory. 
Hundreds of gas-guzzling SUVs inching forward 
in traffic. These are all images commonly associ-
ated with climate change, but for some people, 
these warning signs still don’t register. The Age 
of Consequences, directed by Jared P. Scott and 
just shown at the tail end of the Carnegie Mellon 
International Film Festival, approaches climate 
change from an unusual angle, United States 
national security, in a bid to convince those who 
still don’t believe in climate change of how dire 
the situation has become.
As Scott discussed in a question and answer ses-
sion following the showing, the idea for the film 
came after a conversation where Scott learned 
that his uncle still didn’t fully believe in climate 
change. Scott thought that by looking at climate 
change through a lens of conflict and national 
security, conservatives like his uncle would more 
easily understand the direct impact of climate 
change on their lives.
The Age of Consequences’s main message is that 
climate change is an accelerant to instability — it is 
not climate change alone that causes conflicts, but 
unexpected or particularly brutal natural disasters 
can help exacerbate growingly unstable situa-
tions, and these volatile situations can be a threat 
to the United States’ national security. Scott pro-
vides global evidence, like Syria, where a years-
long drought drove unemployed 
young men to urban 
areas where ISIS easily 
recruited them; later, ISIS 
would use precious water 
as a way to hold communi-
ties hostage. He later brings 
the issue home by discussing 
Hurricane Katrina and the ensu-
ing violence caused by this storm. 
He also uses a more unique 
example, showing how the 
U.S.’s ability to help with 
humanitarian situations and lessen the chance of 
a resulting conflict will be hindered as rising tides 
threaten Naval Station Norfolk, where many of 
the missions embark from.
The documentary presents a new, intriguing per-
spective on climate change and several useful nar-
rative examples, but it quickly becomes repetitive. 
While Scott dissects the film into several chapters 
(“Instability” and “Conflict” for example), the 
actual ideas within each section differ very little 
from each other, making the titles seem arbitrary. 
The basic idea behind the documentary is cer-
tainly interesting, but becomes tedious after it has 
been rehashed again and again. Scott claimed in 
the Q&A that it was his intention to hammer in the 
message that there are immediate national secu-
rity effects of climate change, but he pushes the 
idea a few too many times.
The repetition also rears its head through the 
overwhelmingly dismal outlook of the film. Images 
of desperate refugees, rioting civilians, and armed 
terrorists dominate the documentary, and after 
a while this catastrophic onslaught grows tire-
some. The overdramatic music score makes the 
depressing images even more ominous. There is 
a brief glimmer of hope near the end of the film, 
which encourages action, shows video of wind 
turbines and wave energy converters, and claims 
that the technology and money is available and 
that change simply relies on having the wisdom 
to act. However, this section is short and while 
the rest of the film may feel pertinent to the target 
audience, complex alternative energy technology 
and vague call-to-actions are not as relatable or 
effective. A more extended and focused section 
on what can be done in daily life would have 
been more successful.
Finally, it is important to consider that such a bar-
rage of imagery — violent riots, terrorist convoys, 
and refugees sneaking across borders — that 
mostly involve people of color could prove to be 
harmful even as the film tries to promote climate 
change awareness. Terrorism, civil unrest, and 
illegal immigration are important issues for many 
members of the target audience, so perhaps by 
constantly showing those images and associat-
ing them with threats to U.S. security, the film 
may just be reinforcing xenophobia and fervent 
nationalism. Might The Age of Consequences be 
increasing support for Trump’s wall while also 
teaching new audiences about the effect of cli-
mate change? It can’t be known for sure, but it 
does seem possible that the constant negativity 
matched with images of people of color, as well 
as the fact that the people interviewed about U.S. 
national security are almost entirely white, could 
have unfortunate consequences.
The Age of Consequences has noble intentions, 
a compelling main topic, and numerous convinc-
ing examples to back it up. However, the 
repetitiveness of the argument and 
constant deluge of 
bleak, disastrous 
imagery cause the 
documentary to 
grow redun-
dant and 
difficult to 
continue 
watching.

SPIRIT Fasion Show
This year’s annual SPIRIT Fashion 
Show took on the challenge of 
creating a safe space for individuals 
by addressing a theme of resistance. 
The show explored three different 
stages in the life of a person: 
childhood, adolescence, and 
adulthood. The show was divided into 
three acts, each specific to one of 
these stages. Senior civil engineering 
and engineering and public policy 
major Pierce Sinclair, who was the 
overall chair of the show, explained 
that the show emphasized that 
“beauty has no standard, be it in 
shape, skin, color, or orientation.”
The show featured lines from 14 
designers, and performances from 
Infra Dance Company, Chuku of the 
Wh9le collective, and the SPIRIT 
Dance Group, each catered toward 
one of the different stages. The lines 
within each act also emulated the 
conceptual features of the stage of life. 
The act surrounding childhood focused 
on the concepts of youth and coming 
into the world as a blank canvas, free 
to do what one wants. The adolescent 
act looked at how people begin to 
adhere to trends, and follow others’ 
expectations and standards. The 
adult act was focused on resistance, 
and how people can find themselves, 
break away from beauty standards, 
and speak up for what they believe in.
