* MM Announces 
Frosh Factors
The average midterm factor for 
MMCC freshmen was 2.02. Out of 
142 students, ten girls, or 7% of 
the class, had a factor of 3. or 
above with no failures. Six girls, 
or 4% of the class averaged below *a 1.
Lynn Heinzerling, Overseas 
^ Press Club Award Winner, 1961, 
will be the speaker for the 
day, January 8, 1963 assembly.
Since Africa’s turbulence and 
conflict began exploying into in­
ternational headlines^ with such 
frightening regularity, Lynn Hein- 
zerling’s by-line reports from the 
Congo and the continent’s other 
danger points have been featured 
' on the front pages of newspapers 
throughout the country.
The sharpness and lucidity 
his dispatches on spot develop­
ments, the depth and accuracy of 
his analysis, the abundance and 
significance of his background in­
formation have impressed editors 
and readers alike. Professional 
recognition of the highest order 
followed quickly.
Lynn Heinzerling is a veteran 
of 22 years foreign service with 
The Associated Press who has 
covered such momentous stories 
as the first gunshots of World 
War II at Danzig to the latest up­
risings in the Congo. Before going 
to Johannesburg, he had reported 
from virtually every important 
news center in Europe, including 
Berlin, Helsinki, Copenhagen, 
[v Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, London, 
Cairo, Rome, and Vienna.
Lynn Heinzerling was born in 
Birmingham, Ohio, and was edu­
cated at Akron University and 
Ohio Wesleyan University. His 
first newspaper job was with The 
Cleveland Plain Dealer from 
which, in 1933, ne entered the 
service of The Associated Press. 
He now makes his headquarters 
p in London where he coordinates 
il lof the news from Africa as 
well as personally covering on the 
scene many of the most critical 
and significant news developments 
throughout the continent.
Mr. Heinzerling’s topic of dis­
cussion on January 8 will be “The 
Modern Challenge to the Negro.”
Postmaster Edward G. Coll sent 
up the distress signal today as he 
posed the question, “What ever 
happened to the Christmas mail?*
The post office is ready to 
handle the large volume of holi­
day mail with expanded office 
facilities and extra Christmas help 
on stand-by basis anxiously a- 
waiting the call to go to work. 
However, one big item is still mis­
sing, said Mr. Coll—The MAIL!
Perhaps the cold wave has 
taken precedence over “Writer’s 
cramps”, but the Yuletide greet­
ings are running far behind prev- 
nous year’s schedules, said Mr. 
Coll. Time is rapidly running out 
for late mailers and the next few 
days are bound to be critical. It

Tech Sponsors 
Best Dressed 
Girl Contest
Many complaints have been 
• raised concerning the lack of in- 
I terest displayed by most Tech 
j students with respect to good 
grooming and dress. Dressing 
suitably is- an important matter 
now, but it becomes especially 
essential when applying for em­
ployment and working on the job.
To emphiasize care and good 
taste in dress, Panhellenic coun­
cil is sponsoring a “Best-Dressed 
Girl” contest from February 12- 
17. Any girl on this campus is 
i eligible. The winner will enter 
; the national “Best-Dressed Girl” 
j contest sponsored by Glamour 
j magazine and if she ¿s one of the 
finalists, Glamour will send her 
on a free trip to New York City 
where she will engage in several 
days of visits to Helena Ruben- 
stein. Germaine Monteil and 
other persons of interest. In addi­
tion there are many parties and 
social hours with noted authors 
and other famous people.
Contestants at all levels will 
be judged on neatness and suit­
ability of clothing to occasion as 
well as makeup and posture. De­
tails about entrance, judging and 
elimination procedures will ap­
pear in the next issue of the 
Tartan.
is most important that you mail 
your Christmas cards and gift 
packages now. A delay in getting 
your mailings to the post office 
may mean disappointment to your 
friends and loved ones on Christ­
mas Day, said Postmaster Coll.
There’s still time for local de- 
| livery, but all cards should be 
sent first class mail, using the new 
i 4c Christmas stamp, Mr. Coll ad­
vised. Cards and gifts for out of 
1 town destinations should be sent 
air mail to assure delivery by 
i Christmas day.

Tech English Study CenterC7 J
Improves High School English
Carnegie Tech has received a 
$219,000 research contract to com­
plete the project of the Curricu­
lum Study Center established to 
develop a sequential and cumu­
lative English program for 10-12 
grade college-bound high school 
students in the top 20% of their 
class.
The major objectives of this 
project are to improve reading 
and writing skills, develop new- 
teaching materials, test the new 
program in area high schools, and 
evaluate the results. A long-range 
goal of the total program is the 
establishment of a set of stand­
ards for high-school English 
which colleges can use to revise 
course offerings given to their 
freshmen so that learning will 
continue to be sequential and 
cumulative.
Four members of Tech's English 
Department, Professors Cottrell,
j Josephs, Slack, and Steinberg, and 
i Professor Forehand of the Psy- 
| chology Department will assume 
major responsibility for the pro­
gram. Professor Cottrell teaches 
\ one English course in world liter- 
: ature that was developed this 
summer at Edgewood High 
School, while Professo Josephs 
teaches it at Wilkinsburg High 
School. This year the course has 
oetn installed in six area high 
schools where it is currently being 
taught.
The program includes three 
Summer Planning Sessions in­
volving English teachers from five 
participating high schools. Future 
plans include writing an 11th 
! grade course ar.d installing it in 
the high schools and a final re­
vision of the prepared courses.

will be the 15th year of operation 1 
of the Scandinavian Seminar. This 
unique program provides t h e j 
American undergraduate and | 
graduate wtih a year's living and j 
learning experience in one of the 
Scandinavian countries, 
the year, home stays and short 
seminar courses are combined 
with an extended period of resid­
ence and study in a Folkehojskole, 
an adult education center. This 
combination brings the students 
into very close contact with the 
life of the country. Students are 
also required to complete an inde­
pendent study project.
The curriculum of the Folkeho­
jskole is confined mainly to liberal 
arts subjects with emphasis on 
• Scandinavian literature, language,
; art history, ana social studies, and 
| should therefore appeal to under- 
| graduate generally. The program 
also proved oi great value to 
graduate students in adult and 
physical education.
A great number of American 
colleges and universities have re­
cognized the Scandinavian Semi- 
; nar and many have granted full 
academic credit for the year spent 
in Scandinavia under the latter’s 
! auspices.

When you think of Christinas gifts you naturally think of 
Marlboro cigarettes, leading seller in flip-top box in all fifty 
states—and if we annex Wales, in all fifty-one—and if we an­
nex Lapland—in all fifty-two. This talk about annexing Wales 
and Lapland is, incidentally, not just idle speculation. Great 
Britain wants to trade Wales to the United States for a desert. 
Great Britain needs a desert desperately on account of the 
tourist trade. Tourists are always coming up to the Prime 
Minister or the Lord Privy Seal or like that and saying, “I’m 
not knocking your country, mind you. It’s very quaint and 
picturesque, etc. what with Buckingham Palace and Bovril 
and Scotland Yard, etc., but where’s your desert?” (Before I 
forget, let me point out that Scotland Yard, Britain’s plain­
clothes police branch, was named after Wally Scotland and 
Fred Yard who invented plain clothes. The American plain­
clothes force is called the FBI after Frank B. Inchcliff, who 
invented fingerprints. Before Mr. Inchcliff’s invention, every­
body’s fingers were absolutely glassy smooth. This, as you 
may imagine, played hob with the identification of newborn 
babies in hospitals. From 1701 until 1904^0 American parent

Veterans Receive

erans who incurred a disability as | 
a result of service in the armed | 
forces during any period of serv­
ice since WW II covered by the [

compensation from the govern- j 
ment because of a disability in- | 
curred during either of these per- j 
iods, you may apply for vocational j 
rehabilitation by obtaining VA > 
Form 22-1900 at any Veterans J

ever brought home the right baby from the hospital. This 
later became known as. the Black Tom Explosion.)
But I digress. England, I was saying, wants to trade Wales 
for a desert. Sweden wants to trade Lapland for Frank B. Inch- 
cliff. The reason is that Swedes to this day still don’t have 
fingerprints. As a result, identification of babies in Swedish 
hospitals is so haphazard that Swedes flatly refuse to bring their £4
babies home. There are, at present, nearly a half-billion un­
claimed babies in Swedish hospitals—some of them well over 
eighty years old.
But I digress. We were speaking of Christmas gifts which 
naturally put us in mind of Marlboro cigarettes. What could 
be more welcome at Christmas time than Marlboro’s flavor, 
Marlboro’s soft pack, Marlboro’s flip-top box? What indeed 
would be more welcome at any time of year—winter or sum­
mer, rain or shine, night or day? Any time, any season, when 
you light a Marlboro you can always be certain that you will 
get the same mild, flavorful, completely comfortable smoke.
There are, of course, other things you can give for Christmas 
besides Marlboro cigarettes. If, for example, you are looking 
for something to give a music lover, let me call to your atten­
tion a revolutionary new development in phonographs—the 
Low-fi phonograph. The Low-fi, product of years of patient 
research, has so little fidelity to the record you put on it that if, 
for instance, y6u put “Stardust” on the turntable, “Melancholy 
Baby” will come out. This is an especially welcome gift for 
people who have grown tired of “Stardust”.fkMerry Christmas to all and to all a good night.

Practical Politics Internships 
Applications Available For 1963
Applications for internships in 
practical politics for the summer 
and fall of 1963 are now being 
accepted by the Pennsylvania 
.Center for Education in Politics. 
Additional information and forms 
may be obtained from Prof. Roy 
Curry.
P.C.E.P., which is located at 
Franklin and Marshall College, is 
offering three types of internships 
for students interested in political 
participation.
Award Offered 
For Library
The $1000 AMY LOVEMAN 
NATIONAL AWARD is being off­
ered to a college senior who has 
collected an outstanding personal 
library. Established in 1962, the 
annual award is sponsored by 
The-Book-of-the-Month-Club, and 
Saturday Review, and The Wom­
en’s National Book Association.
A distinguished panel of judges 
will decide the winner. Chairmen 
of Campus Library Award Com­
mittees, after selecting a local 
winner, ai^ asked to submit nomi­
nations of senior students for the 
national award. The deadline for 
nomination is April 30th. The 
award will be made at the win­
ner’s commencement.
For the purposes of the AMY 
LOVEMAN AWARD, a collection 
of not less than 35 books will be 
considered. The student must pre­
sent an annotated bibliograph of 
his present collection and provide 
comments on three relevant 
points: “How I would start build­
ing a home library:” “the next 
ten books I hope to add to my 
personal library and why;” and 
“My ideas for a complete home 
library.”
Collections will be judged on 
the basis of intelligent interest, 
scope and imagination shown in 
creating the collection, and know­
ledge of the books as revealed in 
the annotations. Collections cf any 
type (excluding textbooks) are 
eligible whether centered in a 
subject or avocation, a single 
author or group of authors, or a 
general collection. Additional in­
formation is available at the 
Tartan office.
Van Trump 
Wins Award
James D. van Trump. Hunt Bo­
tanical Library and Architecture, 
has won the 1962 Golden Quill 
Award for the best magazine 
journalism. The award was given 
for his series of articles dealing 
with Philadelphia architecture 
“Pilgrimage to the Present” in 
CHARETTE. His work placed 
better than national journals in 
the running: BUSINESS WEEK in 
fact was judged runner-up.
Internships will be set up for a 
period of eight weeks with Con­
gressmen from Pennsylvania in 
their offices in Washington, D C. 
Students will be paid at a rate of 
$60.00 per week. The internship 
will begin on June 10 or as soon 
thereafter as possible.
A second type of internship will 
be in selected Pennsylvania coun­
ties in the county headquarters 
from mid-August through Novem­
ber 5. Work will be full time from 
mid-August until about September 
13. From that time until the end 
of the campaign, the interns will 
be expected to spend 12 to 15 
hours per week in the program. 
Compensation will be $375.00 for 
the entire period.
In addition, internships can be 
arranged in the offices of pressure 
groups or elected officials. Ar­
rangements for such internships 
are subject to P.C.E.P. approval.
All three types of internships 
are open to students not graduat­
ing in June, 1963. Those graduat­
ing in June, 1963, may not apply 
for county internships.
The internship program is not 
restricted to those majoring in po­
litical science.
Out-of-state students are en­
couraged to make inquiries of 
their Congressmen in regard to in­
ternships. P.C.E.P. will attempt to 
aid any student receiving encour­
agement from their Congressmen.
Drama Department’s Othello 
Attracts Many Capacity Crowds
Tech students stood in long 
lines to obtain tickets for the De­
partment of Drama’s production 
of Shakespeare’s Othello. During 
its rurrfrom November 29 through 
December 11, the play attracted 
capacity crowds including students 
from seventy schools who were 
guests of the departemnt at spe­
cial matinees.
Lawrence Carra, instructor of 
acting and directing, directed the 
production composed of his stu­
dents. Cast in the major roles 
were Joseph Klimowski as Rode- 
rigo; Jeff David as Iago; Louis 
John Dezsran as Othello; Kenneth 
Frankel as Cassio; June Helmers 
as Desdemona and Majorie Moore

completed by student construction 
crews. The setting was designed 
by Frank Silberstein, costumes bp 
John Doepp and lighting by 
Steven Cohen.
The next play Cock-a Doodle

Many Subjects Spur Comment
Senior Suggests 
“Hypnotism
Editor, The Tartan:
Since I am a senior this year, 
what the “powers that be” do 
about Thanksgiving next year is 
probably none of my business.
There as a chance, however, 
that I’ll be going to graduate 
school here. If I do, my teachers 
needn’t bother to look for me the 
Friday after.
There is one dividend for hav­
ing a one day vacation, and pro­
bably a few have thought of it. 
Just think of the joy of giving 
thanks over your Skibo Thanks­
giving dinner.
Maybe everyone could be hyp­
notized before dinner and told 
they are home with their families, 
and are eating home cooking.
Phil Hoff
Liberals Express 
Views On Cuba
Editor, The Tartan:
This retort to Michael Adler 
will not deal with his unjus4 at­
tack on the American woman.
Mr. Adler says that the United 
States looked favorably upon 
Cuba immediately after the Cas­
tro revolution. Then why did the 
United States and the C.I.A. be­
gin to look unfavorably towards 
Cuba and plan and execute the 
Bay of Pig’s invasion? The an­
swer lies in going back over these 
four dramatic years, we find that 
Washington changed its attitude 
when the Cuban revolution be­
gan to touch the foundations of 
society by nationalizing Ameri­
can enterprizes in order to bring 
about a higher standard of liv­
ing for the Cuban people.
Was Castro seeking the aid of 
Russia when he went to Wash­
ington? Or was he not pushed 
into the arms of Communism by 
the basic ideas of our foreign 
policy?
Mr. Adler feels that Cuba cre­
ated an “unbearable, potentially 
critical situation.” As much as we 
dislike Communism, we still must 
recognize the soverign right of 
Cuba to maintain and run her 
economy in a non-aggressive 
manner which will benefit her. 
For when we cease to recognize 
the independence of a country, 
we will inevitably cease to rec­
ognize the independence of man. 
And eventually, we will become 
the very same thing we are sup­
posedly fighting.
Haven’t we whipped the Mich­
ael Adler “yelping Cuban poodle” 
long enough? Let us now re­
evaluate our foreign policy and 
find a peaceful coexistence with 
Cuba and all nations of the world.

Reader Challenges 
Axelrod*s Peace
Editor, The Tartan:
Regarding the editorial “is the 
world ready for peace?”
In answer to Jeffrey Axelrad’s 
call for “a workable plan for 
changing the world to peaoce,” I 
suggest he reads The Peace Race 
by Seymour Melmaan. Seymour 
Melman is an associate professor 
of industrial and management en­
gineering at Columbia University, 
and an expert on United States 
industry. In addition, he is a dedi­
cated advocate of peace, and has 
written this book as a result of 
five years of intensive research 
just looking for answers to some 
of the questions Mr. Axelrad 
raised in his article and others. 
Professor Melman has used tech­
nical information that he has col­
lected from industrial, economical 
and technical studies. He has 
been conducting since 1945. The 
book demonstrates in realistic and 
practical details the constructive
alternatives to the arms race. His 
idea is simply for the U.S. to use 
what he calls our most forceful 
“secret weapon”—unused indus­
trial and manpower capacity to 
compete with the Soviet Union in 
a peace race; that is, a competi­
tive program of industrializing 
emerging nations in which we can 
win and still maintain our pres­
ent level of military expenditure.
Professor Melman’s book is 
truly “ a candle in the darkness,” 
for not only has he recognized 
the dangerous position American 
is in, continuing the arms race 
and its policies, but he suggested 
a workable, intelligent, alterna­
tive to either war or surrender 
without resorting to any dogmatic 
slogans of either the war mon­
gers or the peace mongers.
The Peace Race is available in 
pocketbook edition for $.50, pub­
lished by Ballantine Books, if 
you are looking for “new hope” 
in the peace movement, I strong­
ly urge you to read it.

this letter was not intended to 
run Mr. Axelrad to the hills in 
tar and feathers. It was com­
posed with the hope of shaking 
him back to his basic responsi­
bilities as a news columnist. As 
he states, “The value of opposi­
tion is the positive one of making 
society re-examine its values, and 
each individual re-evaluate his 
views.” Now, for Mr. Axelrad to 
live up to his own policies (pub­
licizing minority viewpoints), he 
must rid himself of the high 
school debating style (by which 
I’m sure he accumulated many 
now-dusty trophies) and re-eval­
uate his own views.
Name Withheld
Student Explains 
Popular Protest
Editor, The Tartan:
I wish to add my vote tc the 
opposition to omission of Thanks­
giving vacation next year. If Tech 
were on a Tri-mester pJan, the 
loss of a day or two’s vacation 
would be understandable. Yet, 
we are not, and I feel that the 
Thanksgiving break is a very 
necessary one.
1. Thanksgiving is a holiday to 
be spent with the family, not 
in a dormitory room.
2. After having classes from 
September on, students need 
a break. We are not ma­
chines!
3. The Jewish holiday, Rosh 
Hashana, falls on that week­
end; many students will cut 
Friday and go home anyway.
Kathy Thompson
Axelrad’s Purpose 
Is Questionable
Editor, The Tartan:
As Copernicus conjectured that 
the earth might not be the cen­
ter of the universe, we might find 
consolation in knowing that Mr. 
Avelrad is not presently a center 
(of interest or viewpoint) on this 
campus. As it was so forcefully 
emphasized in the December 5th 
issue (in headline type), “A Can­
dle in the Darkness”—“Adver­
tisements For Myself (You- 
Know-Who).”
“If the ideas held by a majority 
were printed in this column, it 
would simply have no purpose.” 
Then, what is the purpose of this 
column? As Mr. Axelrad ex­
plains, “The ideal goal of this 
writer is to be figuratively “A 
Candle in the Darkness.” “He 
can not make any such claim if 
he writes on subjects with which 
the majority agrees.” The mean­
ing that I grasp from that state­
ment is that Mr. Axelrad HAS 
NEVER, DOES NOT NOW, AND 
NEVER WILL agree with the ma­
jority. Perhaps, then, that the 
purpose of the column is to al­
ways disagree with the majority 
opinion?
“However, the question of pub­
licizing any minority viewpoint is 
a much larger and more serious 
one.” Mr. Axelrad has made a 
major mistake. He is a columnist. 
As in the last statement I quoted, 
he uses the term publicize which 
meansc “to bring to public no­
tice.” This is the definition of a 
scolumnist—one who lives up to 
the standard of informing. Mr. 
Axelrad has made his error in 
the fact that he has followed a 
policy of disapproval, disagree­
ment, and argument. He has, all 
too often, treated his subjects 
with consistent antagonism and 
casualness. ¡,
In closing, let me clarify that
Is Tech Running 
Student Lives?
Editor, The Tartan:
From the first Western Civili­
zation course to the most ad­
vanced course in Nuclear Phy­
sics, the Tech student is taught 
to question, to doubt, to test, to 
derive, and generally to accept 
nothing without first assuring 
himself of its validity. He is ex­
pected to set up personal stand­
ards of Truth and to maintain 
his integrity throughout his en­
tire range of awareness. It is of­
ten said that this is a principal 
virture of the “Carnegie Plan 
for Professional Education.” How­
ever, it seems to us that in the 
last four-and-a-half years serious 
discrepancies have arisen be­
tween this academic policy and 
the policy for extra-academic af­
fairs.
This first day on campus (Sep­
tember, 1958) one or us asked an 
“old experienced senior” what 
were the rules at Tech. He replied 
without pausing: “(1) Don’t des­
troy Tech property, (2) pay your 
tuition, and (3) learn enough to 
pass the exams.” He was right! 
There were certain rules, of 
course, (such as the one against 
cooking in the dorms), but the 
majority of the students had not 
heard of them and they were 
not enforced. However, since then 
a major change in extra-aca­
demic policy has evolved. In our 
recent experience in contacting 
freshmen in the dorms, we found 
that dorm counselors were per­
forming every function from that 
of hall policemen to that of aca­
demic and psychological advisers. 
The dorm council has developed 
from a committee that facilitated 
communication between lessee 
and landlord to a full-fledged 
legislative and judicial power.
As another instance, consider 
last four years they have changed 
in the minds of administrators 
(both the faculty and the student 
fraternities (private organizations, 
despite Professor Huff). In the 
variety), student body, and, alas, 
even some fraternity men, from 
organizations providing an at­
mosphere where a man could es­
tablish himself in a brotherhood 
of his own choosing, to some sort 
of extra - curricular classroom 
where communal living and intel­
lectual broadening are taught. 
Some of the rules imposed on 
them in the last four years are: 
(1) They must have house­
mothers. (2) They are forbidden 
to build their own homes. (3) 
They are required to register their 
social events and are allowed to 
hold them only if student congress 
decides that some other social 
event (or even athletic event) 
hasn’t priority. The most recent 
occurrence in this humiliating 
trend came last spring when the 
school issued a detailed policy- 
statement for fraternities to obey.
Even some of the more personal 
rights of the students have been 
touched recently. A phone call 
was made from a dean’s office 
urging that all housemothers 
make the members of the organi-

A Candle in the Darkness
By Jeffrey Axelrad
On God
The Christmas season is fast approaching, so it is fitting 
that this column is devoted to discussing one essential as­
pect of this reason—religion. For thousands of years the 
majority of Western men have accepted without question 
the concept of a supreme being. Great religions have arisen, 
all of which state emphatically that there is a God beyond any doubt. There have been deviate movements, and today 
many people no longer are so certain that such an omnipot­
ent being exists, but this article deals only with the major­
ity view.
The concept of God is embedded in the mind; that is, J 
religion demands that it be accepted on faith—not reason 
and evidence. Certainly there is nothing “wrong” with this 
since the world is not completely rational, and one concept 
about which we know nothing (on a rational basis) is the 
concept of supreme being. However even if a person’s mind 
urges him to “accept” a God, it seems a gross oversimplifica­
tion to state that there then is no possibility of a supreme 
being not existing. Faith is not a foolproof way of making 
decisions.
The Nazi party in Germany demanded that its prin­
ciples be accepted on faith—that the people act with their 
“hearts”, without using their minds to cast doubt upon 
their actions. The organized religions present a parallel 
examole. Weak concepts have to be accepted on faith or 
the whole structure falls. Can a person be a “good,: Christ­
ian or Jew if he says, “I think God exists, but of course 
there is always the possibility that there is no such thing.” 
Communists are condemned for their atheists, but is that 
not just a faith that God does not exist? Both atheism and 
religion appeal to a person to decide beyond any doubt 
whether God exists or not. They simply represent oppos-^ 
ite decisions. There seems to be no other fundamental dif­
ference between the two.
It is a very pleasing thought to hold that the universe 
was created just for the people on this small planet. Perhaps 
the Bible is completely correct, but also, perhaps is is a 
fairy tale. After all, it reads like a fantasy and myth 
similar to other tales of that period. Logically the Greek 
gods make as much sense. (Perhaps the whole idea is wish­
ful thinking.) Or on a more modern basis, why accept the 
Bible instead of the Koran? Is there more evidence for 
one? Of course, a person may intuitively feel that one or< 
the other is correct. But can he think so without 'any 
doubts? I personally think it presumptuous for any per­
son to claim that he knows a supreme being exists on the 
basis of his faith. Are such people trying to hrde from the 
real world? (“God will help me; there is a better life in the 
next world.”)
The danger in religion is the same as that in any mass 
movement—that the majority of believers will impose their 
.standards on the entire community. (Why must stores close 
on Sunday instead of on, say, Tuesday?) The religions have 
a blind faith in themselves—and anyone writh a blind faithf 
is dangerous.

zations for which they work dress 
more within “accepted standards.” 
Men not dressed to suit the house­
mothers are not allowed in More- 
wood Gardens ,and certain types 
of dress are not permitted in 
the Placement Bureau.
The result of all these rules, 
policies and regulations is that a 
standards is being set for the stu­
dents to follow. The Alma Mater 
is literally turning into a foster 
mother! The fraternity men, re­
lating the situation to the rule 
requiring them to hire house- 
moti m;, speak of “Creeping 
Mom ism.”
Why does , a school which sup­
posedly stresses intellecutal in­
dependence suddenly start regu­
lating the lives of the individual 
students? The answer is, obvious­
ly, that the administration de­
sires to “improve the image” of 
the school. Improvement of the 
image is believed to.be necessary 
to ease the solicitation of funds 
from the outside world. We 
think this belief is invalid. An­
tioch is a prime example of a 
school that gets along well with­
out projecting an image of ivy- 
covered, Ivy-League conformity. 
Closer to home, Dr. Eddy’s Chat­
ham has done such unorthodox 
things as virtually abolishing 
dorm “hours” for women. (By 
the way, a quick survey will show 
almost no school spirit or apathy 
at Chatham—just a good intel­
lectual atmosphere.)
Two primary considerations 
distrub us deeply: (1) How long 
will it be before the image of 
the academic courses themselves 
will be considered and the courses 
changed as a result; and (2) why 
have the Tech students not brok­
en into open rebellion?

While listening to the radio last Friday, 1 heard one of 
our numerous congressional committees cross-examining a 
witness. As usual the questioner’s voice dripped of authority 
and his attitude of selfrighteousness. This self-styled hunt­
er of witches and wizards was cross examining a woman 
who was president of an organization which promoted 
peace. Her group was small in members and influence, but 
it had one outstanding vice which brought her before our 
investngation demagogue. She claimed that anyone could 
join her organization whether they be white or black, 
young or old. Republican or Democrat, Communist or Fas­
cist. After this damaging statement the interrogators tones 
turned to those of one cross-examining an enemy of the 
state, and even over the radio one could see him assume a 
position akin to that which Soviet George took after slay­
ing the dragon.
Yes, he had caught another Hitler in the bud, stopped 
a Genghis Khan from starting, removed the organization 
from around Lenin, and crushed Stalin all in one full 
swoop. And yet this buffoon is undoubtedly on record as 
stating “I want world peoce.” This hypocrite is willing to 
make a statement to get elected and then to insure himself, 
he hands all those who strive for that same and as enemies 
of the state. Not only does brand them but he prosecutes and 
persecutes as well. Truly a representative worthy of his 
position and worthy to be held in respect.
It seems to me that all to much time is spent on these 
witch hunters by our congressmen. It reached a peak with 
Senator McCarthy and has never died since. Any one who 
strives for the end of peace is chastized. We cannot achieve 
peace on our own. The U.S. cannot say that they are tired 
to fighting and therefore we are now at peace. We must be 
willing to realize that both sides are to agree and if we 
prosecute all of those who attempt this, how can was ever 
achieve our goal?
Yes, we are threatened by a Communist idelolgy. They 
are also threatened by ours. We won’t give in, so why 
should we expect them to? We must co-exist. It is probably 
the only way short of war to achieve peace. And so when 
these small groups organize why should we persecute them? 
Hopefully our leaders have more pressing problems to 
attend to. Let us permit McCarthvism to die and perhaps 
peace to live.

Tech Basketball Team Tops W & J; 
Successful Season Gets UnderWay
by John Blue
Sophomore Ray Morrison, the 
Montour Menace, tied a Carnegie ' 
Tech basketball record as he led j 
his teammates to a convincing 67- j 
57 victory over a good Washington 
and Jefferson team last Wednes­
day night in the Washington. Pa. 
High School gym.
Morrisor tied a record held by 
three other players for most field 
goals in one game. The record is
16. With the addition of the one 
foul shot he made, Morrison rack­
ed up 33 points, undoubtedly the j 
finest game of his career.
Finest Game
It was undoubtedly the finest | 
game of the Tech team this season 
or last, and embarks Tech on a 
tvvo game winning streak, some­
thing that the Skibo gym hasn’t 
seen in two seasons.
It was also a sweet victory for 
coach Mel Cratsley, for it was only 
the second time in 22 years that 
Tech had conquered W&J in the 
Wash High gym. Coupled with the 
JV team victory, 57-56, it was 
the first time in 22 years that 
both teams had taken the measure 
of their opponents.
There’s a law of Physics that 
says that anything that goes up

son, this was modified to “any-

thing that goes up must come 
down in one place; the basket.” 
Morrison hit 9-11 shots in the 
first half and 7-11 in the second, 
giving him 16-22 and a phenomon- 
al percentage of 73%.
It wasn’t all Ray Morrison, 
though. Joe Laird played normal­
ly; i.e., alert, heads-up, sharp 
basketball. Laird led the team in 
rebounds with 10 and added 11
points, most of them coming on 
foul shots in the closing moments 
when they were most needed.
George Frazier didn’t get a field 
goal in the first half, but came 
back to contribute 12 points to the 
cause in the second half. Sam 
Cupps and Hank Werronen came 
through with key baskets and did 
a good job rebounding against 
their taller opponents.
Prexies Tough
The Presidents had lost only 
one game previous to the Tech
clash, and that to powerful Buck- 
nell. Other opponents had been 
demoralized by a hard-working 
press that ended with W&J lead­
ing by a wide margin.
The Prexies press was tried 
against Tech, and for the first time 
this season, Tech parried the 
thrust. Laird, Frazier, and Morri­
son were able to work the ball up
the noor, where they then shot a 
hot 62% in the first half. With 7 
minutes left in the first half, W&J 
gave up the zone and admitted 
defeat in trying to stampede Tech 
into mechanical errors, the hall­
mark of last year’s team.
Halftime found the score 30-30.
Tech Bounces Back
The Prexies roared off to a 36- 
30 lead following halftime, but 
Tech came back to run off 7 
straight points to regain the lead 
37-36. At this point, the Prexy 
coach pulled his regulars, and 
Tech zipped off to a 47-39 lead be­
fore the Presidents could get the 
starters back into the game.
Both teams began to trade bask­
ets, with Morrison, Frazier, and 
Sam Cupps doing the work for 
Tech. As the time diminished, 
W&J resorted to fouls to get the 
ball. In contrast to the Indiana 
game, Tech came through with the 
necessary foul shots. Frazier and 
Laird scored the last 9 points to 
ice the game for Tech.
Westminster Here
The powerful Westminster Ti­
tans, ranked the number one 
small college team in the coun­
try by the UPI board of coaches, 
travel to the Tech gym tonight to 
take on the resurgent Tartans. The 
Titans, 5-0 as of last Sunday, have

NEW WINNING STREAK

The rising Carnegie Tartan 
basketball star hit another pla­
teau last Monday a week as the 
team snowed an underpowered 
Thiel quint, 61-49, at the Skibo 
gym.
Sparked by the baskets of Ray 
Morrison and George Frazier and 
the all-round excellence of Joe 
Larid, Tech was never in trouble. 
Tech’s deliberate, set-play offense 
¦worked to perfection against a de­
fense that rarely moved to break 
Up the patterns.
And if the shot from the plays 
missed, Sam Cupps, starting his 
first varsity game, was there to 
gather in the rebounds. Cupps 
picked off 15 rebounds, almost a 
third of the Tech total of 49.
Tech Never Headed
While the Tech offense was 
working .for and getting the good 
shots, Thiel was having to scram­
ble to get any sort of shots against
score. The Tartans were still 
rammings the points through the 
hoop, so the margin was still pre­
served.
Win Easily
Down by 14 points with 3 min­
utes left, Thiel began pressing. It 
was no use, as the Tartans turned 
pressing fouls into points. Tech 
easily handled the late surge and 
won with ease.

After bowing to a strong Wash­
ington and Jefferson squad Wed­
nesday, December 12, the Tech 
mermen ended their pre-Christ­
mas schedule by swamping the 
Western Reserve Redcats at the 
Case pool last Saturday, Decem­
ber 15. The Skibos were never 
headed as they plunged to an 
early 41-11 lead and easily coasted 
to a 61-31 victory, losing only 
three first place finishes enroute.
Len Lester and Geary Andrews 
led the way for the Tartans as 
they each won two events. Lester 
copped the 200 Individual Medley 
and Breaststroke, while Andrews 
won the distance freestyle events, 
the 200 and 500. The Tech Med­
ley Relay Team of Wyman, 
Specht, Burdett, and Trbovich 
gave Tech its first relay win of 
the season.
Tom Brunson took first in the 
200 Backstroke and second in the 
Individual. Bennett and Snow 
took first and second in the diving 
as did Wyman and Burdett in the 
200 Butterfly. Second places were 
captured by French in the 50 and 
100 Freestyle and Specht in the 
200 Breaststroke.
Last Wednesday W&J handed 
the Tartans their second defeat, 
63-32, at W&J. The Tartans had 
good clockings for their four first 
places. Andrews set a school mark
of 6:07.^[n the 500 Free, while 
winning this and placing second 
in the 200. Lester led the scoring 
with dual victories, in the 200 In­
dividual and Breastroke. Wyman 
provided the other Tech first in 
the 200 Butterfly. Brunson enabl­
ed Tech to sweep its only event 
by placing second in the Indivi­
dual. King, Walsh, and Shaw led 
the Prexie's attack.
Lack of outstanding Freestyle 
sprinters have weakened the line­
up. Overall, the squad shows con­
siderable improvement over last 
year’s and should surpass last sea­
son’s 3-8 record. Exciting competi­
tion is expected in the upcoming 
meets.

When a Homestead High School 
boy goes out into the world and 
j makes his mark, the School Dis­
trict Board back home thinks 
j something should be done about 
it—and acts accordingly.
Which explains the resolution 
passed by the board last week 
and signed by its president, A. E. 
Ackley.
It noted that four of its gradu­
ates had contributed recently to 
the high schools athletic tradition.
One of the four so honored was 
A1 Abels, hard running senior 
halfback on the Tech football 
team, and the man voted by the 
coaches and players as the most 
valuable player on the 1962 team.
“Be it resolved,” the resolution 
states, “that the achievements of 
these graduates ... be formally 
j and officially recognized and com­
mended, and that the board ex- 
| press its appreciation and grati­
tude to these men for their con­
tributions to the good name of 
j Homestead High School in the 
! athletic world.”
the stingy Tech defense.
Thiel finally woke up to the fact 
that its man for man defense 
wasn’t working and came out in a 
zone in the second half. Ray Mor­
rison immediately hit two long 
jumpers and the zone didn’t look 
too hot, either.
Tech began to let down slightly 
in the second half and Thiel took 
advantage of momentary lapses to

As it stands right now, it looks 
like ATO has started a monopoly 
on major intramural sports cham­
pionships. In addition to their 
football crown, Alpha Tau Omega 
is now the proud owner of the IM 
volleyball championship. They 
won this by defeating a strong 
SAE team two games out of three 
in the finals.
In the semi-final round, ATO 
won two straight from the Grad 
Eagles 15-10 and 15-11. Both 
games were very close until the 
score reached about 10-10. Then 
ATO reeled off successive points 
to take both games. The Grads 
had perhaps the best player on 
the floor in hard-spiking Fred 
Kosofsky but they were no match 
for the extremely well-balanced 
ATO squad made up of Tom 
Blackwood, Chip McKnight, John 
Bertucci, Jim Hagerman, Ernie 
Parti, and Steve Foels.
In the other semi-final match, 
SAE defeated Tau Delta Phi, last 
year’s champions, in two straight 
games. The scores were 15-11 and 
15-10. Again, it was team balance 
that won the match against the 
outstanding play of Borofsky and 
Yablon of TDP. Fine sets by 
Mehltretler, Tamarelli, and 
Wright, fine spiking by Jones, Mc- 
laughlin, and Gammon, and gen­
eral all-round steady play by SAE 
was the difference in the match.
The final match was a thriller 
right down to the wire. Underdog 
SAE was obviously fired up for 
the first game, but ATO seemed a 
little overconfident. The result 
was a 15-9 victory for SAE. The 
spiking of Frank Jones and Tom 
McLaughlin was the big factor in 
this one but the victory had to be 
considered a team effort.
The second game began as a 
rout of ATO as SAE built up a

quick 9-2 lead. But now ATO 
settled down and pulled even by 
virtue of some fine plays by 
Blackwood, McKnight, and Ber­
tucci. With the score tied 11-11, 
ATO reeled off four successive 
points to win the game and even 
the match at one apiece.
The final game was a real 
squeaker. Several hard spikes by 
McKnight and Hagerman gave 
ATO a brief early lead of 3-1. But 
SAE caught up and stayed even 
until the score reached 12-12 
when Harvey Gammon pounded 
across a spike that put SAE ahead
by one. ATO regained the serve 
and drew even when Gammon 
was called for reaching over the 
net. The serve changed hands 
twice and then an SAE error gave 
ATO a 14-13 edge. On the next 
volley, John Bertucci set one high 
in the air for Chip McKnight who 
slammed it through the floor to 
give ATO the game, the match 
and the championship. .
The fine SAE team certainly ¦ 
disn’t lose any face in this one, 
but the ATO powerhouse proved 
to be the best when the chips 
were down.
