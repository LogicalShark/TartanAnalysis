7 Carnival Queen Candidates Administration Conducts
To Be Announced Tomorrow . . n JO ,Investigation Oft ood Serviceby Elissa Parker
The Spring Carnival Queen will be crowned Friday, 
April 7, and will reign over the spring weekend activities. 
She will be chosen from candidates nominated and spon­
sored by each of the seven campus sororities.
The week beginning April 26* ~
will constitute the campaign per­
iod for the candidates.
The girls will visit the fraternity 
houses and mens’ dormitories, 
and pictures of them will be 
posted in various places on cam­
pus. In addition, each sorority will 
be permitted to put up one banner 
anywhere on campus featuring its 
candidate.
At 4:30 on Friday of that week, 
the queen presentations will be 
held in the gymnasium.
Men will elect candidates from 
May 3 to 5.
The names of the candidates 
and the themes of the presenta­
tions will be submitted tomorrow, 
and will soon be announced. The 
queen presentations will be based 
on the Spring Carnival theme, the 
“Twenties,” each sorority choos­
ing a headline from that period.
Four songs sung a cappella will be 
used in each presentation. Props 
will be used on stage this year.
Sororities also will be permitted 
to use one gimmick in their pres­
entation or one publicity gimick on 
campus to supplement the banner.
Each skit will last from five to ten 
minutes.
The queen will be crowned by 
President Stever at 1 a.m. during 
Friday’s Call Day Program. The 
program will be held on the Fine 
Arts patio and lawn.
The three queen finalists will be 
escorted by men from Scabbard 
and Blade, the national military 
honorary. Following the corona­
tion, honorary calls will be made, 
and activities keys presented. The 
bag-pipe corps will play during 
the program.
The sorority relays will follow 
immediately at 2 o’clock.
GSIA Holds 
Exec Program 
On Analysis
A nine-week Program for 
Executives (PFE), concerned 
with analysis and decision­
making in modern manage­
ment, is underway at Carnegie 
Tech under the direction of 
the Graduate School of In­
dustrial Administration 
(GSIA).
Executives in middle and upper 
management levels in 17 com­
panies, representing the fields of 
insurance, steel, communications, 
transportation, space, oil, glass, 
and shipbuilding arrived here for 
classes on March 7. Two of the 
participants come from England 
and one from Saudi Arabia.
The course will run through 
May 7, with a break for the Easter 
holiday.
The emphasis throughout is on 
the overall management process 
and the ways in which manage­
ment can respond effectively to 
emerging problems in its environ­
ment.
The teachers in the PFE are 
full-time members of the GSIA 
faculty. Special sessions are con­
ducted by distinguished men from 
industry, government, or other 
academic institutions.
The program is under the di­
rection of Dr. Neil Churchill, as­
sociate professor of Industrial Ad­
ministration.
TG1F
There will be a TGIF this Fri­
day at 4:30 in Skibo. Music will 
be provided by the Sounds.
Last week’s TGIF had to be 
cancelled because of the five- 
hundred high school mock UN 
members who would be milling 
about Skibo between 5 and 6 
p.m. on Friday. The ballroom 
was not available, and the re­
sulting situation would have 
been uncomfortable.

450 Participate 
In Rights Protest
by Carol S. Guber
Approximately 450 people par­
ticipated in a March 13 protest 
demonstration against the murder 
of Reverend James Reeb, a Boston 
minister and member of the civil 
rights’ movement.
The demonstration was held in 
the vicinity of the University of 
Pittsburgh. It included a rally 
which was held outside the Pitt 
Student Union and a silent one 
hour march around the Cathedral 
of Learning, Heinz Chapel and 
Stephen Foster Memorial. After 
the march, a service was con­
ducted in Heinz Chapel by Cath­
olic, Protestant and Jewish clergy 
in memory of those Americans 
who have been killed or have suf­
fered for the cause of civil rights.
Student Congress accepted 
a proposal to change the 
standing rules on defection of 
officers, in a meeting held on 
March 3.
The amendment to the constitu­
tion will read as follows: “In the 
event that the Chairman or the 
Vice-Chairman should resign be­
fore two weeks of Spring semes­
ter have passed, a special election 
shall be held at the next sched­
uled meeting of Congress to fill 
the vacant office. Should the va­
cancy occur after this time, no 
election will be held, with the 
order of succession being Chair­
man, Vice-Chairman, then head 
of the General Campus Commit­
tee.”
Congress also covered several 
other items of business:
According to the congress re­
port, vending machines will be 
installed in major campus build­
ings before the end of the year.
The finance committee also dis­
cussed the possibility of receiving 
revenue from Skibo vending ma­
chines; the revenue now goes 
to the food services.
A change in Skibo hours was 
announced. With the exception of 
Sunday, when the building will 
close at 10:30 p.m., all of Skibo’s 
facilities will be available until 
12:00 a.m., Monday thruogh Sat­

line backup, insufficient storage 
facilities, and outdated equip­
ment.
His recommendations, which 
will be utilized by the adminis­
trative committee, will involve 
either changes in the present sys­
tem or a long-range program of. 
development.
Though Carnegie Teen supplies 
the food for the food service op­
eration, the system is managed by 
Stouffer’s which decides upon the 
recipes, servings and prices.
The food service was placed 
under Stouffer’s management in 
1960. Prior to that time, the sys­
tem was under the direct manage­
ment of Carnegie Tech. But ac­
cording to George K. Brown, dean 
of student affairs, “Though we 
didn’t have major problems with 
food service, we didn’t think it 
to be the best ... by employing 
Stouffers, we thought that we’d 
get better food service and fewer 
student gripes.
However, the Student Affairs 
Division has been confronted 
with student complaints. These 
complaints deal with the cost 
and size of servings, menas, 
service, and sanitation.
Because of these complaints, the 
administration is also reviewing 
the food policies themselves.
The Student Court of Student 
Congress Executive Council needs 
to fill two justice seats.
All Carnegie Tech students are 
eligible to apply for the positions.
Applications should be sub­
mitted to Skibo, room 103 before 
4:30 p.m., March 24. They should 
include in a one-page outline 
form: reasons for applying, college 
experience, other pertinent activi­
ties, and ideas for the betterment 
of student Court.

Pledges Plot Pranks 
On Active Brothers
Bureau Keeps List 
Of Summer Jobs
by Howard Weiss
The pledges of Carnegie Tech’s fraternities have 
been making life rough for the actives with their traditional 
pledge pranks. ?----------—-----------------------------------
From Pi Kappa Alpha comes 
the report that a group of raid­
ing “Eskimos” made off with all 
the toilet tissue and silverware 
in the house.
At Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 
pledges kidnapped an active and 
took him out of the house. When 
the brothers attempted to rescue 
him, they were pelted with water 
and smoke bombs. In the ensuing 
confusion, the pledges took all the 
house’s silverware, turned off all 
the hot water and tear-gassed 
the cellar.
Phi Kappa Theta pledges put 
sugar in active’s beds and trash 
cans in their bedrooms. They al­
so moved an active’s car on the 
Phi Kappa Theta patio.
A number of pledge paddles 
were found missing at Tau Delta 
Phi. The mischievous pledges al­
so removed all the house’s shower 
fixtures.
Sigma Nu’s novices tied an ac­
tive to a telephone pole in front 
of Morewood Gardens and doused 
him with water.
Pledges at Delta Upsilon re­
moved all the house’s silverware. 
They also boarded up all the win­
dows and doors of neighboring 
Beta Theta Pi.
Beta Theta Pi pledges conduct­
ed a huge snow ball raid against 
the actives. In only one night they 
succeeded in throwing three 
brothers into the shower.
An active at Beta Sigma Rho 
was kidnapped and taken to Mt. 
Lebanon by his pledges. The 
pledges also turned over a house j 
phone booth, took the silverware, 
and removed the seats from the 
toilet bowls.
Several Kappa Sigma actives 
were tossed in Westinghouse pond.

j The Bureau of Placements sug­
gests that students interested in 
summer employment periodically 
review listings of summer job op- 
portunties on file in the bureau 
library, in suite 10, Skibo.
New litsings are received and 
placed in the library on a daily 
basis.
According to E. F. Ventura, 
Alumni Placement Officer and 
Summer Employment Coordina­
tor, “Unfortunately, it appears 
that many of these jobs will not 
be filled, or taken by students 
from other schools because our 
students seem not to be reviewing 
the listings.”
Computerized Pen-Pals
Pen-pals from around the world 
are matched by a computer at the 
Parker Pen Company Pavillion of 
the New York World’s Fair.

Pen-friend program matched in 
correspondence over 800,000 vis­
itors to the fair who had similar 
interests.

Tod Johnson 
To Tour USSR
by Elissa Parker
Tod Johnson, junior graphic 
arts major, has been invited to 
participate in the 1965 US-USSR 
cultural exchange program, the 
YMCA office announced last week.
Johnson is one of about twelve 
American college students who 
will tour the Soviet Union and 
several Eastern European coun­
tries as a participant in ttie ten 
week program. He will visit var­
ious cities and towns in the Ar­
menian, Georgian, Russian, and 
Ukrainian Republics of the So­
viet Union and also in Poland, 
£ Czechoslovakia, Rumania, and 
Yugoslavia.
The exchange is sponsored by 
the national office of the YMCA 
under the auspices of the state 
department. In recent years So­
viet students, as part of the pro­
gram, have been guests of the 
YMCA in the United States.
In the Soviet Union the Ameri­
can students will be guests of 
4 the Komosol, the Communist 
- Youth Party, who will serve them 
as hosts and guides throughout 
their stay. The students will also 
spend a period of two weeks with 
Soviet students in a summer sports 
camp.
Throughout the exchange the 
members will be given the op­
portunity to talk with the po­
litical, economic, and educational 
leaders of the various countries.
^ Johnson is now raising funds 
for the trip by appealing to var­
ious organizations and individuals 
and by offering to serve as a 
speaker upon his return to USA.
Johnson is a member of Delta 
Skull, editor - in - chief of the 
Thistle, a member of PiDE, the 
YMCA, and Tau Delta Phi Fra­
ternity.

Student Union Needed
Where can students sit comfortably and socialize infor­
mally on the Carnegie Tech campus?
There are upholstered chairs and several pianos in More- 
wood lobby, however, these can be utilized only by Morewood 
residents and their “guests.” The fraternity houses have 
living room-lounge facilities, but only a small percentage 
of the male Carnegie Tech population are Greeks.
There is Skibo. But when that building was constructed 
in 1960 it was never intended to be a student union. Its 
Wherrett Lounge, Ballroom, Highlander meeting room, and 
seven basement meeting rooms may be reserved by com­
munity organizations as well as on-campus groups. Its lobby 
has seating facilities for less than 60 people, and is often 
utilized for ballroom affairs.
The most popular student gathering place on campus is 
the Skibo snack bar. This one room may at present be 
called Carnegie Tech’s student union. But although it is the 
only room in our “Campus Activity Center” which has been 
designated exclusively for student use, it does not seem to 
have been designed with a student population in mind.
As a student union, Skibo’s snack bar is unsatisfactory j 
for Carnegie Tech students.
The snack bar has no booths, and every table is family- 
sized. It has a jukebox but no room for dancing. It lacks an 
intimate, homey atmosphere.
What students want and what Carnegie Tech needs is a 
ski-lodge type building, comfortably furnished and equipped 
with a variety of recreational facilities.
We want more than just two ping-pong tables and a 
single music room. WTe want bowling alleys and pool tables. 
We want a place where we can play bridge, chess, or check­
ers; where we can meet and talk or dance.
We want a student union.
We want a college student gathering place, not a student 
union which doubles as a faculty-community conference 
center and a local high school students’ Friday night hangout.
Because such a Carnegie Tech student union would be 
designed exclusively for student use, it could be staffed by 
student personnel. It could be managed by Student Congress 
under the authorization of the administration.
The University of Pittsburgh, Penn State, and many other 
universities have recreation centers for student use. They 
have provided furnished lounges in their student unions. We 
feel that Carnegie Tech should also provide its students 
with such facilities.

You’re looking ot the intelligent product of one week’s 
work. (Some might be in your campus library.) They’re 
technical bulletins written by some very talented scientists 
ond engineers ot the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. JPL people 
write over 500 such documents each year. Documents with 
titles like “Evaporation Effects on Materials in Space," and 
’’Simple Guidance for Deep-Space Booster Vehicles." 
Pretty heady stuff.
But then designing spacecraft to reach the Moon and
planets is a pretty head-y assignment. And it takes a lot of 
bright people to make it happen. Where do these bright 
people come from? Better colleges and universities around 
the country. Yours, for example. Why not sign up for on 
interview with a JPL man? Besides working at the most 
fascinating job in the world, you'll also have lots of good 
books to read.®

1st Of A Series About' Changes On Campus
Skibo Was Formerly 
A Lab, Gym, Arsenal
Following its use as a repair 
center for airplanes, Skibo be­
came a gym, lecture hall, automo­
bile laboratory, art studio and 
ROTC arsenal, a dance hall, and 
finally a cafeteria. Until the 
"Skibo I” cafeteria, fine arts stu­
dents. engineers, and Maggie 
Murphs could be seen sipping 
coffee, copying homework, play­
ing cards and reading the Scot, 
Carnegie Tech’s former humor 
magazine.
On October 30. 1959, over 1500 
students stormed the cafeteria in 
order to commemorate the last 
day of one of Carnegie Tech’s 
oldest landmarks, Skibo I. The 
party was complete with a band 
and “refreshments.” Activities 
ranging from dancing to beam- 
climbing to chair-piling.
Skibo II, completed in Septem­
ber, 1960, was designated as a 
‘•Campus Activities Center.” It 
was constructed to provide facili­
ties for a cafeteria and snack bar, 
offices for student organizations 
and some administrative depart­
ments, and a ballroom and meet­
ing rooms for faculty-student- 
community use,
It was also designed to include 
two commuter “rest” rooms, a 
music room, and a photography 
laboratory.
Because of student complaints 
about Skibo facilities, the Skibo 
Activities Committee of Student 
Congress is considering plans that
by Candy Etkin
Skibo officially opened on April 2, 1918 as the Langley 
Laboratory of Aeronautics. It stood where The Hunt Library 
is now situated. * ~Y To Hold
Workshop
Verna Volz, Executive of the 
Carnegie Tech YMCA, will di­
rect a national student YMCA 
tutorial workshop, to be held in 
Pittsburgh during t h e week of 
March 21 to 26.
Twenty-five students and fac­
ulty from several parts of the 
county will participate in the 
program. They will evaluate and 
attempt to improve the tutorial 
projects in the North Side and 
in the Lower Hill.
Participants in the program will 
observe tutors from the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh and Carnegie

MMCC Does Study 
On ‘Role Of Women
Classified Ads

han after 5:30 weekdays, all day Sat. 
Call 673-9316.
by Sue Attinson
Margaret Moi rison Carnegie College is conducting a re­
search program on the role of educated women in American 
society.
According to Dr. Edwin R. Steinberg, dean of the college, 
the aim of the program is to determine what her <<newly 
emerging life pattern means to the American woman.”
Research was initiated five#—-— -----------------------  -________
years ago when Dr. Sonia Gold, 
assistant professor of economics
and social studies at Carnegie 
Tech, conducted a survey of 
[ i.MMCC graduates. The purpose of 
| of the survey was to determine 
how many graduates would be in­
terested in furthering their formal 
education.
This September, under the di­
rection of Dr. Shirley Angrist, who 
formerly taught sociology at the 
University of Pittsburgh, MMCC 
began a study of the “self-image” 
of the entering MMCC class. Aim­
ed at determining the curriculum 
^ and counselling needs of the stu- 
*'dent body, this study has been 
conducted by means of question­
naires and personal interviews.
Also affiliated with the problems 
of women in education, is a study 
which was conducted by Betty 
Jane Lloyd, Assistant Dean of the 
College. This study examines 
counselling programs for under­
graduate women. Last May, the 
United States Office of Education 
^granted more than $15,000 to
* MMCC so that the college could 
further investigate the problem of 
women’s counselling. MMCC spon­
sored an inter-collegiate confer­
ence which was attended by rep­
resentatives of 50 colleges. ’
With the support of the United 
States Department of Labor and 
the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the 
school plans to run another such 
conference.
I Eventually, the college hopes to 
establish a formal research insti­
tute for study of the role of the 
educated woman in American so­
ciety.
Though the research work is
2 One-Act Plays 
To Be Presented
still being carried out, the inititial 
results have influenced MMCC at­
titudes toward curriculum, coun­
selling, and hiring.
Speaking about MMCC hiring 
policies, Dr. Steinberg said, “We 
hope to get more people like Dr. 
Angrist, who are themselves edu­
cated women.” He also stated that 
a new approach to the freshmen 
counselling program is being con­sidered.
MMCC has instituted honor 
seminar programs for seniors and 
sophomores and plans to establish 
a third such program for juniors. 
The existing seminars examine 
woman’s role in society and in literature.

A NEW PROGRAM OF INTEREST TOMEN
It isn't easy to become an officer in the United 
States Army. Only the best young men are selected. 
The training and course of study are demanding.
I* But if you can qualify—and you should find out 
if you can—you will receive training which will put 
you a step ahead of other college graduates. Army 
ROTC training will give you experience that most 
college graduates do not get—in leading and man­
aging other men, in organizational techniques, in 
self-discipline and in speaking on your feet. This 
kind of experience will pay off in everything you
do the rest of your life.
Army ROTC has a new program designed spe^“ 
cifically for outstanding men who already have 
two years of college, and plan to continue their 
college work. During your junior and senior years 
in this program, you will receive $40 per month. 
Want to find out more about the program? Simply 
send in the coupon below, or see the Professor of 
Military Science if you are now attending an 
ROTC college. There’s no obligation—except the 
one you owe to yourself.

SPORTS
Basketball Year Disappointing, 
Hopes High For Next Season
by Tom Terpack
Jeff Kalin
was most certainly Jeff Kalin, who 
led the team in scoring and re­
bounding. To a slightly lesser de­
gree, Donny Keefer also had an 
outstanding year, as did McGeary, 
until he broke his arm.
The prospects for next year 
again seem good, with only Hank 
Werronen and McGeary lost by 
graduation. Kalin and Keefer will 
return, along with a highly im­
proved Ray Burdett, who played 
some fine ball towards the sea­
son’s end. Pete Riccardelia, Chet 
Reft, Jim Newell, and Neil Houser 
will be available also.
Tech’s brightest hopes, however, 
are centered on two players who 
have yet to don a Tartan uni­
form. Jim Brown, this year’s PA 
announcer, was ineligible this 
year, having transferred from 
Denison, but is certain, at 6-6, to 
play a vital role next season. 
Tech’s other hope is, at this min­
ute, just that ... a hope. He is 
Cliff Parsons, who is 6-10 and av­
eraged 30 points and 22 rebounds 
per game this year for Gateway 
High School. The grapevine has it 
that Parsons has narrowed his 
choice of schools down to three, 
and Tech is still in the running. 
If, and it’s a big “if,” CIT gets 
Parsons . . . watch out for the 
Tartans.

Looking in retrospect at Tech’s completed basketball j 
season, it can be seen that there were three distinct periods ! 
. . . high hopes, hope, and no hope. The year began with high j 
hopes of a successful campaign.
An aura of optimism hung over 
Skibo Gym, for, even with the 
absence of Ray Morrison and Sam 
Cupps, there were six returning 
lettermen and a number of good 
prospects from the previous year’s 
jv team.
Tech’s first bad break, an omen 
of ill to come, was the loss of 
Jules Borkowski. Jules, who had 
jeen CIT’s number two scorer for 
three straight years, suffered an 
attack of pneumonia which side­
lined him for the entire season.
There is no doubt that Tech miss­
ed the hustle, deft, shot, and ag­
gressive driving skill that 6-0,
195 lb. Borkowski would have af­
forded.
After losing the first two games 
to Pitt and W&J, Tech reached 
what was perhaps the season’s 
zenith, in the first Westminster 
game. Against an obviously better 
ball-club, the Tartans outhustled 
the highly favored Titans through­
out the contest, barely losing in 
the final minutes. Had Tech con­
tinued to play this style of ball, 
a winning season would have been 
assured, but such was not the case.
The spark of desire seemed sadly 
lacking after this contest.
In the ensuing weeks of the 
first semester, Tech managed to 
beat Waynesburg and winless 
Thiel, and were 2-6 when they 
met Penn State. The Nittany 
Lions proceeded to methodically 
rip Tech to shreds, and, in the 
humiliating 69-36 defeat, crush 
what little was left of the Tar­
tans’ pride.
With hope just about extin­
guished, the Tartans, led by a re­
juvenated George McGeary, won 
two out of three games, beating 
Allegheny and Western Reserve.
McGeary, who had upped his field 
goal percentage to 68%, broke his 
arm in the last mew seconds of 
the WR game, however, and with­
out his aid the Tartans closed 
out the season with five straight 
losses to finish 4-15.
Tech’s outstanding star this year
Swimmers Post 
Winning Year, 
Set 4 Records
Boasting a 7-3 record this sea­
son, the Carnegie Tech swimming 
team became our second win­
ning team of the school year. Re­
lying on their freestyle strength, 
the Tartans swam their best sea­
son in four years, erasing al­
most all previous school records.
In the Penn-Ohio Champion­
ship meet the Tartans set four 
more records, finishing fifth be­
hind Grove City, Slippery Rock, 
Lockhaven, and Youngstown. 
Peter Hutter set a new 100 yard 
freestyle record with an astound­
ing time of 51.7 seconds. Geary 
Andrews set a new 200 yard 
freestyle mark with a time of 
2:04.4, 6 tenths of a second bet­
ter than the old record held mu­
tually by Andrews and Bill Cots- 
worth.
Both Tech relay teams set new 
records in the meet. The Medley 
Relay of Kiefer, Specht, Burdett, 
and Hough finished with a time 
of 4:19.5 and the Freestyle Relay 
of Hough, Hutter, Yahr, and An­
drews swam to an impressive 
time of 3:34.7, almost 6 seconds 
better than the previous record.
Prospects for a winning season 
next year are excellent with 
eleven lettermen returning. The 
Tartans lose only two lettermen, 
Dave Specht and Bill Hartlep, 
this year. Specht holds the pres­
ent school record in the 200 yard 
breaststroke at 2:37.1.
$Intramural Night This Friday; 
Cage Championship To Be Held
by AI Green
This Friday evening, March 19th, Intramural Night will 
be held in the gymnasium. This year’s program will be one 
of the most colorful in the history of the event, and will bQ 
centered around the championship* 
game in I. M. Basketball. At 6:45 
the tip-off of the consolation en­
counter will begin the program.
YOU?
Are you in a Tartan 
photo? Prints of all pic­
tures, whether or not they 
appeared in the paper, are 
available for $1.00 per 8x10.
To order, call the Tartan 
office at 682-4557, or con­
tact Martin Shenker, photo­
graphy editor.
At half-time of this game, a 
championship co-rec badminton 
match will be held between a 
team composed of Bob Balzer and 
Carol Thompson, and one com­
posed of Gary Pfeiffer and Mary 
Ellen Hirsch.
Between the eolsolation and 
championship basketball games, 
the Council of Fraternity Presi­
dents will challenge the Women’s 
Athletic Association to a volley­
ball game. Even with such stand­
outs as Hank Werronen of BTP, 
Bill Von Twistern and Jim Law­
ler of ATO, Dave D’Appolonia 
and Smokey Merrill of DU, and 
Tom Glassberg of Sigma Nu, early 
reports have it that most of the 
money is being put on the W.A.A.
At 8:15 the tip-off will be held 
for the championship game in In­
tramural basketball, and at the 
half-time of this game, John Op- 
penheimer, president of the I. M. 
Board, and Jay Earley, president 
of the Manager’s Club, will pre­
sent the first-place trophies to the 
winners of those sports which 
have already been completed.
With the large amount of spec­
tator interest already shown in 
I. M. Basketball this year, the 
stands should be filled early in the 
evening, and those interested in 
getting good seats should plan to 
arrive accordingly.
At the time this article went 
to press, eight teams were left in 
the running for the basketball 
championship; GSIA, BTP, ATO, 
PKA, the Grad physics, the Grad 
Nads, A. J/s Civil Hammers, and 
Ray Morrison’s Trips to Win, but 
by the time this edition is dis­
tributed the field will have been 
reduced to four, as a result of
Monday night’s quarter-final en­
counters.
In the upper bracket, first- 
round action found GSIA whip­
ping SAE 59 to 34 as Dick Murphy 
scored 17 points, Bob Crotty 
added 11, and Ed Prescott and 
Art Nevins tallied 9 and 8 respec­
tively. John Muholland was tops 
for SAE with 12 points. The Civil 
Hammers got a 15 point perfoml|) 
ance from Mel Ramey and a 14 
point one from Paul Rizzo in de­
feating the Frosh 49 to 34.
Ray Morrison scored 29 points 
in leading the Trips To Win to 
a 61-44 win over the Finks, de­
spite a 22 point splurge by the 
Finks’ Jon Rupnik, and an 18 
point night by Ken Wincko. Fin­
ally, BTP found the going a little 
rough against the Dead Beats, but 
Dale Johnson’s outside shootin, 
finally made the difference in 
50 to 38 win. Johnson led the 
winners with 19 points, while 
Tom Mauretta and Jim Kamn 
each added 9.
In the other bracket, ATO de­
molished the Victims 64 to 27, as 
Bill Schliep hit for 24 points and 
Frank Oliver added 20. PKA 
upset Sigma Nu 34 to 27, as Sigma 
Nu found its offense less effective 
with the absence of John Blue. 
The Grad Physics got a 24 poiiiV) 
performance from Bill Oosterhuis 
in defeating DU 42 to 33, and the 
Grad Nads found GSIA “B” a 
little troublesome, but held on for 
a 38 to 33 win.
