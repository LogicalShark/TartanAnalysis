H’ coming Plans Begin; 
Tech To Elect Queen
Plans are well underway for Homecoming 1965 at Carnegie Tech. 
Preliminary voting for Homecoming queen is being held this week. 
Candidates may be nominated at the Morewood Gardens' desk by two or 
more freshman women.
Judges representing the fra­
ternities and dorms will select 
seven semi-finalists from the 
nominees and three finalists will 
be selected from the seven semi­
finalists in a campus-wide vote.
The 1965 Homecoming Queen will 
be crowned Friday, October 22. 
The evening also will feature a 
concert by The Brothers Four.
The Brothers Four began sing­
ing as a group while students at 
the University of Washington. 
Their first album, titled “The 
Brothers Four," contained their 
first big hit — “Greenfields." 
Released as a single, «‘Green­
fields" sold over a million cop­
ies. Since then, ’I’he Brothers Four 
have appeared at colleges, night­
clubs, on concert tours and ma­
jor television programs.
The Fenways, nationally known 
instrumental group who recorded 
“Walk" will provide discoteque 
music for the Saturday night Tech 
Au' Go Go dance.
Programs write-ups for frater­
nity and dorm Homecoming dis­
plays should be given to Phil 
Vormelker at Beta Theta Pi house 
by this Friday.
Homecoming tickets soon will go 
on sale. Further information is 
available from Bob Glaubinger, 
Homecoming Committee chair­
man, 621-5919.
Tech Acquires 
New Volumes
Acquisitions by the Hunt Library 
now include a greater number of 
books dealing with the humanities.
Additions in the fields of history, 
comparative literature, plays and 
modern languages allow the student 
to delve more deeply into these 
and related areas.
Library purchases depend 
largely on its budget. The empha­
sis is on books which are pertinent 
to the Carnegie Tech curriculum.
The library staff is at all times 
willing to accept student sug­
gestions for possible new pur­
chases. Students may fill out sug­
gestion blanks which can be obtain­
ed at the main desk of the library. 
The forms should be returned to 
Mrs. Scarlott, assistant librarian.

Fraternity Rush Rules
Tech To Survey Fraternities 
For Civil Rights Compliance
by Candy Etkin and Liz Seley
In late July a statement was issued by the commissioner of Education to the effect that to comply 
with the Civil Rights Law of 1964, those universities and colleges receiving federal aid and maintain­
ing fraternity and sorority systems as part of their program must be sure that no descrimination be­
cause of race, creed or national origin exists.
A new Education Bill, not yet 
approved however, contradicts the 
Civil Rights Law by stating that 
there shall be no intrusion in the 
selection of members for social 
fraternities or sororities. The bill 
has now gone back to committee 
for the inclusion of a rider which 
will stipulate that only those houses 
unowned by the institution or are 
off-campus will be affected by the 
Education Bill.
If the Education Bill is not 
passed, steps will have to betaken 
to enforce the Civil Rights Bill.
A survey regarding discrimina­
tory practices on the Carnegie 
Tech campus will be taken by the 
administration so that they in turn 
can assure the federal govern­
ment that Carnegie Tech's frater­
nity and sorority systems are 
operating in compliance with the 
law.
President stever will most like­
ly be required to sign a statement 
which will discuss any discrimi­
natory practices and the admini­
stration efforts to alter them.
1. Rushees may contact a fra­
ternity man at any time.
2. A rushee is permitted in a 
fraternity house only during a 
scheduled rush event.
3. A rushee is not permitted 
in an apartment associated with 
a fraternity man.
4. Quiet hours will prevail in 
the dorms from 7 p.m. until 8;30 
a.m. each night. Quiet hours means 
that a fraternity man shall not take 
the initiative in discussing frater­
nity affairs, although other per­
sonal contact is all right.
5. Fraternity men are prohibited 
from giving rushees anything of 
monetary value. Loaning them mo­
tor vehicles is against rush rules 
but giving them rides is not.
6. Fraternity men cannot offer 
rushees alcoholic beverages at any 
time, in or out of fraternity houses. 
No alcoholic beverages may be 
served at any scheduled rush event.
7. No oral or written bids may 
be given before the start of formal 
rush second semester. No oral or 
written bids may be accepted until 
the first day of pledging.
8. Invitations to attend rush 
functions may only be extended
ke oSCdn yNC rCSdn
All day graduate students will 
be required to report to the Cash­
ier's Office, B.H. 155, on October 
11, 12, or 13 to obtain appropriate 
fellowship authorization and cards 
upon which correct fees have been 
entered.
Late registration penalties will 
be imposed for failure to complete 
the financial arrangements by Oc­
tober 13, 1965.
Upon completion of payment, 
graduate students will receive an 
identification card and after Oc­
tober 13 no checks will be cashed 
without presentation of that card.
SC Holds First Meeting; 
Proposes New Constitution
by Candy Etkin and Liz Seley
Student Congress convened its first meeting of the 1965-66 school 
year on September 21. Dick Elder, president, presided over the meet­
ing.
The meeting consisted of an­
nouncements of upcoming events 
and plans. Congress members 
were presented with copies of the 
revised constitution which they 
were asked to read and comment on 
at the September 28 meeting.
See Editorial, Page 4
Plans for acquiring the Student 
Congress Bulletin board are near­
ing completion. The bulletin board 
which is all-weather, glass - en­

for informing students of all cam­
pus activities.
Gail Whitacre, chairman of the 
Freshman Orientation Committee, 
reported on the success of this 
year's program. She stressed that 
the success was due mainly to the 
overwhelming enthusiasm on the 
part of the freshman class.
Students are needed to fill posi­
tions on various congress commit­
tees. For further information con­
tact Dick Elder at SAE fraternity 
house, 682-9211.

9. Further interpretation of rush 
rules requiring immediate action 
will be made by the CFP Rush 
Chairman, Curt Chandler.
10. Rushees allowed in houses 
during scheduled meetings or 
campus activities.
11. Quiet hours will prevail in 
dorms only for 1 hour immediate­
ly preceding each rush event.

by Carie Polis
Vice president in charge of re­
search and dean of graduate studies 
at Carnegie Tech, Dr. Charles L. 
McC abe, has been appointed deputy 
assistant secretary of commerce

of absence from Carnegie Tech to 
accept the post.
Commenting on the appointment, 
Carnegie Tech President H. Guy­
ford Stever, said, “Dr. McCabe's 
absence in the crucial area of re­
search is one which we shall feel 
deeply. However, it is comforting 
and gratifying to see a man with his 
many abilities attracted to the ser­
vice of his country.
While the loss of a man of his 
stature always creates hardships, 
universities must recognize that 
one of their important functions is 
to provide * brain power' for go­
vernmental agencies concerned 
with the problems of all U.S.
Dr. McCabe received his B.S. 
degree from Dickenson College in 
1943, and his M.S. and Ph. D from

Ceilidh Provides Students 
Entertainment, Expression
by Bob Arnold
C eilidh (pronounced Kay-lee) is a Scot-Gaelic word meaning to gather 
together or to party—usually for the purpose of self-inflicted musical 
entertainment. The Carnegie Ceilidh, Folk Music Society, has for the 
past four years held informal gatherings in this tradition, Friday 
nights during the school year in the Skibo Wherrett Room.
The purpose of the Ceilidh is to 
give student (and faculty) folk mu­
sic enthusiasts achanceto meet 
and exchange material and techni­
ques, and to try their courage 
against an audience.
Howard Glasser,Assistant Pro­
fessor of Graphic Arts at Tech, 
who organized the Ceilidh in 1961, 
points out that the Ceilidh is for 
anyone. There is no membership, 
no dues, no formal organization of 
any kind. Students are members 
when they enter the room. Any­
one with an interest in folk music 
of any kind is welcome to come 
and take his turn at playing or 
singing, or just sitting and watch­
ing.
The Carnegie Ceilidh also spon­
sors an annual Ceilidh Concert.
(Last year, together withtheCom- 
mittee for the Promotion of the 
Arts at Duquesne, it brought Pete 
Seeger to Pittsburgh.) The profits 
from these concerts are used for 
the rental of films on folk music 
and related entertainments which 
are shown at the Ceilidhs.
In addition, Glasser conducts a 
program of folk music every Sun-

This year the Ceilidh will re­
turn at 9 p.m. on October 8 to the 
Wherrett room at Skibo. This will 
afford an excellent opportunity for 
students new to Pittsburgh or to 
Carnegie Tech to meet other stu­
dents who share their interests in 
folk music. It will continue hapha­
zardly on most Fridays through­
out the year with sundry entertain­
ments, films, and unexpected cur­
iosities and diversions, as well as 
the usual annual Ceilidh Concert.
The official Ceilidh calendar 
lists the dates for the Ceilidh 
meetings this year as: October 8 
(guest artists), 15, and 29; Novem­
ber 5 (free film), 12 (Norwegian 
folk group presentation), 19; De­
cember 3, 10 and January 7. C eilidh 
announcements will be pi ac ed on 
the Ceilidh Bulletin Board in the 
Skibo Snack Bar.

Editorial
Purposeless Revision
The Tartan In its first issue, stated, ‘«the present constitution of 
student government has proved in many respects very unsatisfactory. 
The primary difficulty is that the delineation of responsibilities, pri­
vileges, and jurisdiction of the various branches of government is 
vague, resulting in infringements by some branches on what should be 
the responsibilities of others, and nullifying the effects of check-and- 
balance systems which are incorporated in the frame of government.”
Yesterday, Student Congress discussed a revised constitution 
of the Student Government. This revised constitution, however, fails 
to remedy these problems. It does, in fact, produce new problems and 
serves only to aggravate the existing situation.
Viewed from a theoretical standpoint, the student government is analo­
gous to the United States government in that it has three branches: 
executive, legislative, and judicial. An integral part of this organiza­
tional frame is the system of checks-and-balances which provides a 
mechanism to prevent any branch from infringing upon the responsi­
bilities of any other branch.
In reality, however, the revised constitution eliminates much of the 
check-and-balance system, confuses the legislative and executive 
functions, and delegates to the legislative branch, i.e., Student Con­
gress, many executive functions. Moreover, the chairman of Student 
Congress, who prepared the revised constitution, has placed much of 
this power in his own hands and in the hands of the other Student Con­
gress officers.
The constitution provides that the chairman of Student Congress be 
also the president of the student body. This is a combination of executive 
and legislative functions. The president of the student body is an exe­
cutive position. The holder of that office must be the head of student 
government and must represent the student body to the administration. 
Clearly, the head of the legislative branch should not possess these 
executive powers, for this nullifies the check-and-balance system that 
operates between legislative and executive branches.
Moreover, the responsibility of evaluating the existing state of student 
activities, which is also, most certainly, an executive function, has been 
assumed by the chairman of Student Congress.
Thus, the head of the legislative branch has usurped many powers 
which should be under the jurisdiction of the executive branch. In so 
doing, the powers and functions of the Executive Council have been 
relegated to virtual insignificance.
The Executive Council has been denied the power to enforce legislative 
action; it has been denied the power to hold student activities accountable 
for their finances. This power previously in the hands of the Executive 
Council, has now been incorporated within the functions of the Finance 
Committee of Student Congress, which should be responsible only for 
the preparation and presentation of the student activities budget.
Furthermore, this revised constitution is designed to operate only on 
a temporary basis, i.e., for one academic year, during which a con­
stitutional committee, under the authority of the Rules Committee of 
Student Congress, is to formulate an entirely new constitutional frame­
work.
This appears to be making change for its own sake, at the whim 
of the leaders of Student Government. Why could a constitutional com­
mittee not operate while the old constitution is still in effect? Authoriz­
ing radical changes in the framework of government over so short a 
period as one year will serve only to throw the Student Government into 
a state of flux.
The chairman of Student Congress has failed to differentiate be­
tween the responsibilities of executive and legislative branches of 
student government. This merger of responsibilities will ultimately 
result in the concentration of power in a few individuals' hands. This 
constitution must not be accepted.
CFP To Hold Help Sessions
The Council of Fraternity Pres­
idents, in conjunction with the Col­
lege of Engineering and Science, 
will sponsor a series of help 
sessions for freshmen this fall.
Any freshman who needs assist­
ance in calculus, physics, or chem­
istry may attend the first session 
on Sunday, October 10, at 8 p.m. 
in room 126-C, Porter Hall. Sub­
sequent help sessions will be held 
weekly on Sunday evenings until 
December 5.
The original plans for the fresh­
men tutoring program were pro­
posed in the spring of 1964. Under 
the leadership of Curt Chandler, 
junior, mechanical engineering, 
the first year of the program, 
1964-65, was a success. This year 
the tutoring program is being or­
ganized by Selden Campen, junior, 
physics. To keep the ratio of 
freshmen to tutors below 3 to 1, 
there will be more tutors per 
subject this year.

Multiversity In Microcosm
This Friday will mark the first anniversary of the ‘«Police Car Af­
fair.” The car was attempting to remove a member of the University 
of California’s student underground from the Berkeley campus when it 
was surrounded by 3000 demonstrators. The car was immobilized for 
32 hours while the Free Speech Movement led an impromptu rally from 
its roof.
Mass arrests and fumbling gestures of conciliations by the administra­
tion finally quieted Berkeley. With the resumption of classes though, 
rebellion may again be in the wind. So says a representative of the 
Students for a Democratic Society who predicts rebellion on campuses 
across the country this year. If Carnegie Tech is on the list, we wonder 
what our own Mario Savio will be protesting when he climbs onto the 
roof of the campus cops’ truck.
He might protest the multiversity.
When U. of C. President Clark Kerr delivered the Godkin Lectures at 
Harvard in 1963, he coined the word Multiversity to describe the present 
state of the major U.S. university.
He defined it as “a mechanism - a series of processes producing a 
series of results - a mechanism held together by administrative roles 
and powered by money.” Research, in science and the social sciences; 
teaching, graduate and undergraduate; arts and sciences; all are autono­
mous in the multiversity. Their only tie is a mushrooming administra­
tion whose role is no longer only keeping the sidewalks and ivy-covered 
walls in good repair. The multiversity administrator runs a public 
utility producing endless tentacles of specialization from government 
and industry grants. Undergraduate teaching almost inevitably suffers 
and knowledge is considered one of many of the multiversity’s products.
The description is Carnegie Tech, as surely as Fine Arts could 
sink into the earth unnoticed by the engineers and as solidly as the new 
administration building rising on the cut. Perhaps the only major dif­
ference is size (100,000 at U. of C.)
What then is Carnegie Tech’s potential for revolution?The SDS not­
withstanding, slightly worse than that of an undefeated football season. 
While we here content ourselves with affairs like last week’s inoffen­
sive peace offensive, even during the FSM crackdown at Berkeley 
students continued to agitate for such far out causes as the right to 
smoke marijuana and to buy contraceptives at the university bookstore.
The Berkeley catalyst, too, is absent here. The student underground 
of rusticating undergraduates and academic bums who consider them­
selves a necessary force for the political awakening of the regular 
student were at the core of the FSM. Carnegie Tech may have a few such 
but the underground flourishes only at schools large enough to get lost in. 
A class of 200 in political theory is both easy and tempting to crash; a 
class of 20 in magnetic field theory is neither.
In the size factor a curious paradox reveals itself. The Berkeley 
underground’s chief complaint against the multiversity was the size 
(27,500) and impersonality which allowed it to flourish. With neither 
the environment from which an underground may grow nor the aspects 
of the multiversity against which it may rebel, Carnegie Tech can rest 
easy. There will be no revolution here.
The Search 
For Understanding
Birth Control
By James Panepinto
The time has come when the is­
sues concerning birth control must 
be viewed intelligently and respon­
sibly as a national problem. The 
number of children born who are 
unwanted and uncared for is in­
creasing rapidly, both in foreign 
nations and the United States. In 
the past, many Americans over­
looked these problems in foreign 
nations by rationalizing that they 
were none of their concern. Even 
if these problems were realized, 
many refused to relate them with 
the fundamental question involving 
birth control.
Some view the government’s in­
volvement in birth controljnatters 
as an attempt tolegislate mo­
rality. Many Catholics want the 
government to remain uninvolved 
in these highly explosive areas be­
cause they feel that any federal 
action to provide information con­
cerning birth control to the public 
would interfere with their private 
lives. The individuals who argue 
this point fail to realize how they 
are interfering with the lives of 
others who could benefit from birth 
control measures or at least who 
want to learn more about them. 
No one is going to use contra­
ceptives unless they wish to; birth 
control is indeed a private affair.
The Catholic group who is afraid 
that others will legislate morality 
upon them have succeeded in legis­
lating morality upon others. This is 
definitely not an argument for the
hierarchy of the Catholic Church to 
suppress their views on birth con­
trol, but they should not interfere 
with the beliefs of anyone whose 
beliefs are favorable to birth con­
trol practices or to those who wish 
to gather mor e information con­
cerning them. The pressure the 
Catholic Church has applied in the 
past has been a primary force in 
the government’s refusal to Initiate 
birth control legislation.
The sea of controversy has not, 
however, kept the federal govern­
ment from finally taking action. 
Government advisors want to make 
advice and prescriptions available 
to the poor in general and to the 
Negro poor in particular. Negro 
birthrates are forty per cent high­
er than those of whites in the 
cities. Negroes have smaller in­
comes but larger families and 
more illegitimate children, and 
there has been much indication that 
birth control measures are desired 
but unavailable.
Every individual has a private 
decision to make—on the morality 
of birth control measures. Every 
individual also has a responsibility 
to co-operate toward the best in­
terests of the nation and the world. 
If the availability of birth control 
information is essential for pro­
gress within our world, then one 
must be able to fit co-operation 
into one’s personal framework 
without sacrificing one’s beliefs, 
whatever they may be.

Editor, the Tartan;
S *n S, in all reality, is a 
closed society. It is made up of a 
group of individuals who control 
the administrative board, who head 
the cast, and who carry on the 
production of the show. It’s the 
original ««in-crowd”; a group of 
students who lack any Interest for 
the school as a whole because 
they are consumed with self-in­
terest. On the productive end, 
many seem to consider S *n S as a 
stepping stone to Broadway. As a 
result, the show is Broadway gear­
ed; with a «‘star is born” atti­
tude. The very production negates 
any concept of a school activity, 
but rather has turned into a ««one- 
man” show. There are many 
talented students at Tech who are 
willing to work hard for an acti­
vity such as S *n S. They would 
be willing, that is, if they didn’t 
get the “freeze” from the ««elite.” 
Why not let more students par­
ticipate, not as chorus members 
standing far behind the ««star” 
but rather as helpful members of 
the cast?
Why have only one star; one 
star for 1964; the same for 1965? 
Are we in for any variety in 1966?
Why must we identify S «n S 
with Snob rule? If it is a school 
activity, then let the students run 
the show, not just one director, one 
writer and ««the star.”
And one more why! Why npt make 
this year’s S «n S4 ah original 
musical comedy?
To the members of S *n S:
1. You have no impartiality in your 
ranks. Case members should not 
be administrative board mem­
bers. Neither job can be done 
efficiently that way, nor in an 
unbiased manner.
2. Remember Skibo isn’t Broad­
way—keep S *n S a school ac­
tivity.
3. Get rid of Snob rule—Snob 
society—and a snob deep freeze. 
Open up S *n S to the school
and perhaps the students can take 
pride In a Tech activity. If Tech 
students have an honor system, so 
should Scotch and Soda.

* From The Middle Of The Bus
by Michael Malakoff
The March
After assembling at the church, singing and listening to a number of 
speeches, we filed outside and formed two lines. My marching partner 
was Meridas, a Negro girl, whom I had met about fifteen days before in 
Washington. My mind wandered over the speeches we heard about 
marching: the positions assumed to protect <pneself, the people from 
student and nonviolent Medical Committee who would be along in case of 
police brutality, now a common occurrence in the South. As a standard 
precaution, I was not wearing my glasses, which would otherwise 
afford a convenient handhold for the police. Some of the girls who came 
from the Washington Lobby cut their hair.
Earlier, on our way to the church, a man had pulled a gun on the 
driver of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party car. He kept the 
driver at gun point until the police came at which point he accused the 
civil right's driver of reckless driving and the policeman promptly 
fined him $29.00. This is Mississippi law. This is the law that Amer­
icans allow.
Holding hands, we marched peacefully two abreast two blocks up 
Ferris Street. Police were everywhere. We then assembled in a 
vacant lot and Mrs. Devine, the 4th District candidate for Congress 
began to speak. Two columns of police came up and arrested her. They 
isolated us from the rest of the crowd. James Foreman started to 
speak and was promptly put under arrest. We were then ordered into 
cattle trucks. The group went limp, locking hands and arms. The police 
started pulling us apart, throwing us on the trucks. The boy in front 
of me was carried spread eagle towards a pole. Luckily, he managed to 
maneuyer ^¡ody just before hitting. James Foreman was kicked in 
the gro^p. jjhfts police grabbed me, twisting my arms, digging their 
fingers into my muscle. They were glad we had resisted. Their faces 
showed perverse joy.
At the fairgrounds jail, we were lined up with our hands against a 
wall. Soon, a policeman searched our bodies for weapons. After some 
standard questioning — name, age, home address — we went to a small 
room. Here we were denied rest room facilities and water until an 
MFDP lawyer reached us about seven hours later, at which time the 
police said that we had not been denied these basic rights. Soon we 
Awere segregated and put into a large room. The Negroes were in one 
half and the whites In the other, separated by an imaginary line. All 
during this time, the police surrounded us, constantly baiting us. This 
was to be our home for an indeterminate time. We each had a mattress 
from nine in the evening until five in the morning when our day began. 
We did not have sheets. For the other sixteen hours, we stood or sat on 
the concrete floor. During the night, the lights were kept on and the 
police (banged) their night sticks against the walls and floors — sounds 
echoed throughout the jail.

80 Frosh Queried About Tech
So that it might obtain up-to-date information about the attitudes of recently admitted students, last 
spring the Admissions Office queried selected freshmen concerning their impressions of Carnegie Tech.
Eighty students, representing each college and department, received questionnaires. Of the 68 responses, 
34 were from the College of Engineering and Science, 21 from the College of Fine Arts, 6 from Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College, and 7 unidentified.
The following are some survey
questions and their responses; 
How did you first learn about 
Carnegie Tech?
The most frequent responses 
were: From relatives; from high 
school guidance counselors; they 
live in the Pittsburgh area.
In your personal contacts with 
CIT representatives, did you re­
ceive factual inforamtion? (55 — 
yes; 2 —no.)
Did our catalogue give you the 
information you wanted: (49 — yes;
19 — no.)
17 singled out lack of course 
descriptions are the source of their 
complaint.
Do you think the CIT catalogue 
and other printed material gave a 
true picture of Tech? (50 — yes; 
16 —no.)
Did you have an interview in 
the Admissions Office? (38 — yes; 
27 — no.)
Was your interview helpful and 
pleasant? (38 — yes; 6 — no.)
Was CIT your first college 
choice? (5 5 —yes; 12 — no.)
Of the 12 negative replies, the 
breakdown was: MIT, 3; Stanford, 
2; and one each for Case, Brown, 
Columbia, Georgetown, Tufts- 
Jackson, and Cornell.
What was the key factor which 
led you to choose CIT as your 
college?
26—Carnegie's good reputa­
tion* 12 —Because they live in 
Pittsburgh; 8 — Because of schol­
arship; 4 — Because it was recom­
mended by parents, teachers or 
friends. 18 students offered var­
ious other reasons including: size 
and co-educational atmosphere.
Madrigal Group 
To Perform 
At Assembly
The Student Madrigal Choir of 
Muenster Germany will perform 
at the October 5 assembly in 
Skibo Ballroom at 11:30 a.m.
The assembly programs have 
been scheduled this year to allow 
at least one 11:30 Tuesday class 
hour as a .convenient time for 
student and faculty groups to meet 
individually.-
The Tuesday class hours that 
will remain open are October 26, 
November 2, November 30, De­
cember 7, January 4, and January 
11.
Future guest speakers during 
scheduled assembly hours will in­
clude Mortimer Adler, philosopher 
and teacher; and Pierre Salinger, 
former press secretary to Pres­
ident Kennedy.
Was your academic transition 
to college difficult?27 — yes; 37 — 
no.)
13 of the 27 singled out poor high 
school training as the reason.
After attending CIT for a semes­
ter do you find it
A. Intellectually stimulating? 55 
—yes; 12 — no.
B. Culturally stimulating? 45 — 
yes; 21 — no.
C. Socially active ? 44 — yes; 23 
—no.
The level of difficulty of my 
course work has been
A. Easier than I expected. 10.
B. About what I expected. 41.
C. Harder than I expected. 15.
My class instruction is poor 
(12), average (34), excellent (17)?
A further breakdown indicates: 
College of Engineering and Science 
instruction, eight poor; 20 average; 
five excellent. Fine Arts: two poor, 
eight average; 10 excellent. Mar­
garet Morrison: one poor; three 
average; one excellent.
Is there any particular com­
plaint you have about CIT?
E & S students most frequently 
complained that: a specific course 
was poorly taught, the Adminis­
tration does not understand or help 
the students, and that Orientation 
Week is not sufficient preparation 
for college work. Margaret Mor­
rison students' most frequent com­
plaint was about a specific course. 
Fine Arts students replied that: 
tuition is too high, the administra­
tion is •puritanical* and there are 
not enough liberal arts courses.
Would you be willing to rec­
ommend CIT to a close friend as 
a place to study? 56 — yes; 3 — 
no.
In analyzing the results of the 
survey the Admissions Office 
stated;
WRCT To Carry 
Comp Center Info
WRCT, the campus radio stat­
ion, announced that it intends to 
carry the hourly turn-around 
information currently available 
from the Computation Center. 
Residents of the dorms and per­
sons who spend a portion of 
their working day on campus 
will find WRCT a convenient 
method of keeping informed re­
garding computer status.Cur- 
rent plans are to broadcast the 
information on the hour and half- 
hour.
•Realizing the limitations in­
herent in a survey of this nature 
it is still interesting to note the 
large number of students who 
complained about the poor qual­
ity of instruction, the lack of 
cultural stimulation, the lack of 
understanding on the part of the 
Administration, and the lack of 
social activity other than that 
provided by the fraternity 
system."

Coach’s View 
Of SwimTeam 
Optimistic
Following last year’s fine 7-3 
record, Coach Claude Sofield is 
anticipating another outstanding 
swimming season. Some of the 
incoming freshmen have good 
qualifications, and with returning 
lettermen like Geary Andrews and 
Bill Burdette, co - captains, and 
Pete Hutter, Bill Cotsworth, 
Les Hough, Dave Kiefer, and Steve 
Yahr (just to name a few) the 
future for the team Looks bright.
A meeting is scheduled for 
Wednesday, October 13 in 
the swimming team dressing room 
at 4:30 p.m. All varsity team 
members and prospective fresh­
men candidates are urged to at­
tend. Sofield is putting out a call 
for two team managers. Fred 
Welter and Tom Eppinger had 
managed the team for four years 
with such deftness that the water 
didn't even ripple, and the coach 
is very desirous of acquiring two 
such managers again. He requests 
that any freshman or upperclass­
men Interested in such a position 
register in Gym 102 before the date 
of the meeting.
Tech Athletes 
See Revival 
Of "C” Club
Interest has been generating 
among Carnegie Tech athletes 
about the possibility of reviving 
the Varsity *C* Club. The member­
ship is limited to those athletes 
who have letters in a varsity sport, 
and it is considered an honor to 
belong to such a club.
The club elects its own officers 
and runs itself under the sponsor­
ship of the director of athletics. 
Meetings are usually held approxi­
mately twice a month.
In general, there is some work 
involved in the club for the purpose 
of raising funds, and a nominal 
fee of a few dollars is charged 
for dues. The money earned is 
used to: (l)buy additional awards 
over and above those given by the 
school (2) sponsor parents' night
(3) hold Varsity Club parties and
(4) sponsor such other events as 
decided upon by the club.
F. M. Cratsley, director of ath­
letics, requests that all return­
ing varsity lettermen vote in Gym 
102 as to whether they want to 
aid in regeneration of the 
Varsity ‘C’ Club.

Wooster Edges Tartans, 21-15,
On Last-Minute Pass Play

Tartan photo by John Mera
Wooster College edged Carnegie Tech’s Tartans 21 to 15 on a 70-yard pass with two minutes to play in 
Tech’s 1965 football opener at Wooster last Saturday.
The Tartans, who had led through most of the game, were winning 15-13 and had Wooster bottled up on 
their own 30-yard line with 2;18 to play when Wooster halfback Rod Dingle got behind the Tech defenders, 
took the pass over his shoulder, and went all the way for the deciding score.
Grads, ATO, BTP <> 
To Be Tough In IM
by Chuck Beard
I.M. football has started another season and it looks like any one of 
the perennial powers could take it. ATO, BTP, GSIA, and the Grad Nads 
are favorites, and many others have the ability to upset any of these 
teams.
It was a tough loss for the 
Tartans, who played a rough game 
and gave the bigger, heavily favor­
ed Ohio team and their home fans 
quite a surprise.
Both Teams Threaten
Wooster took the opening kickoff 
and marched 56 yards, all on 
running plays, to the Tartan 10. 
But freshman Joe Chernay inter­
cepted a pass in the end zone to 
kill the threat, and the rest of 
the first half was all Carnegie 
Tech.
After an exchange of punts, two 
key runs by quarterback Tom Hub- 
ka and fullback Dick Merrill moved 
the ball to the Wooster 13. How­
ever, with third down and one on 
the four-yard-line, Wooster held 
the Tartans and then quick- 
kicked out of trouble.
Two Quick Wooster Scores
This lead lasted until, with 4;09 
left in the third quarter, Wooster 
scored twice in less than three 
minutes. Halfback Rod Dingle, who 
scored all Wooster's points, found 
a big hole in the line and burst off 
tackle for a 67-yard TD run to 
make it 12-6, Tech.
Then came a bad break for Tech. 
After the Tartans took the ensuing 
kickoff and couldn’t move the ball, 
Jim Williams dropped back to punt 
and saw the snap from center sail
over his head. Williams covered 
the ball on his own 10-yard line, 
but Wooster took possession and 
scored when Dingle ran it over 
from the three. Dingle's kick was 
good and Wooster led for the first 
time, 13-12.
Williams Kicks FG
Tech moved right back to the 
Wooster seven, only to lose the 
ball again when Hubka was drop­
ped in his own backfield on fourth 
down.
Wooster fumbled seconds later, 
though, the Tech’s Dick Bell jump­
ed on the ball. Bell then took an 
8-yard pass from Hubka for a 
touchdown, and Tech led 6-0 at 
halftime.
On the first play of the second 
half, Hubka caught the Wooster de­
fense flat-footed with another pass 
to Bell, a long bomb for 74 yards 
and a touchdown. The conversion 
kick was no good, and the Tartans 
led 12-0.
In the fourth quarter, Tech 
marched to the Wooster 12 with an 
effective mixture of passing and 
running. Here two carries by Mer­
rill netted five yards, and when a 
third-down pass fell incomplete, 
Williams booted a field goal to give 
the Tartans a 15-13 lead with nine 
minutes left in the game.
That was the way things stood un­
til Wooster quarterback Bob C our - 
son threw the big one to Dingle 
with 2;18 remaining.
Tech had one last chance when 
Hubka completed a 36-yard pass to 
end Bill Coleman to put the ball 
on the Wooster 40 with 1;19 left. 
But Dick Bell was hit hard after 
taking a short pass and fumbled 
on the 36-yard line.
Defensive back Curt Blosser 
recovered, the Wooster ran out 
the clock.
Running back Jim Williams, who! 
played both offense and defense and 
did most of the kicking, was voted 
the outstanding Carnegie Tech 
player in the game. Quarterback 
Tom Hui)ka, who passed for 176 
yar ds and two touchdowns, and full­
back Dick Merrill also starred for 
Tech.
Rod Dingle, who gained 126 yards 
rushing and 67 yards on passes 
and scored 21 points, was the out­
standing Wooster player.

Tech Skydivers 
Start Season
Carnegie Tech's Skydiving Club 
will hold its annual organizational 
meeting tomorrow night at 8 p.m. 
in the Wherrett Room, Skibo. A 
color film, “The sport of the Space 
Age,” will be shown, followed by a 
lecture and demonstration on the 
art of sport parachuting.
Tech’s skydivers are looking for 
new members to replace the four 
members of last year’s club who 
graduated. The skydivers compete 
in meets with the Mon-Yough Sky- 
divers of Pittsburgh and other lo­
cal parachute clubs.
In a meet, each jumper tries to 
land as close as possible to a four- 
inch disc in a target area on the 
ground. A jumper can compete in 
the “advanced” or “novice” class.
Tech’s skydivers have already 
jumped in one meet this year, at 
Markle Field in New Kensington on 
September 19. Alan Babich placed 
seventh in the advanced class and 
Bob Blasier, placed 24th. Jim 
White jumped in the novice class.
Any Carnegie Tech student, re­
gardless of experience, can be­
come a skydiver. Lessons and 
equipment for beginners cost about 
50 dollars, and equipment rental 
is about five dollars a jump. Any­
one interested should go to the or­
ganizational meeting or contact 
Bob Blasier at Sigma Nu.
Tech skydivers hurtle earthward.
GSIA will probably take the 
Eagles League this year, but they 
will have problems with SAE and 
the Civil Hammers. SAE has lost 
the services of Harvey Gammon, 
their All-Star quarterback, but 
they still have a good team.
BTP should coast to the Steeler 
League championship this year be­
hind quarterback Bob Livengood.
In this league the only battle should J 
be for second where SN will try 
to fight off the Civil Nails and 
ATO “B”.
In the Browns League ATO“A” 
and TDP “A” will fight it out for 
first and second, along with strong 
opposition from PKA. But ATO 
should end up on top. ATO lost 
many of their players last year 
but have a fine crop of sopho­
mores who graduated from last 
year’s “Cellar Dwellers” team.
It looks like the grads will con­
trol the Giants League, with a bat­
tle for the top spots between the 
Grad Nads and GSIA. NSR will 
put up a fight but they are proba­
bly not strong enough to pull the 
upsets they did last year. A “may­
be" team will be BTP“B”. The 
freshman team, the Laundrymen, 
aren’t as good as last year’s ^ 
Cellar Dwellers, bp| with-prac­
tice they could improve.
The top teams are pretty well 
balanced this year, so four weeks 
from now the trophy could be on 
anyone’s shelf.
