Presidential Election Overturned
( $ by Eric Petersen
The recent election of the President of 
Student Government has been declared 
null and void, according to the chairman of 
the Election Appeals Board, Ken Meinert. 
This body met Saturday morning to rule 
upon an election appeal submitted by Don 
Simon, outgoing Chairman of the Senate 
Student Finance Committee, which 
charged that neither of the candidates was 
qualified to run.
In his written statement, Simon claimed 
that Rick Edahl, who is enrolled in the 
Ph.D. program in SUPA, is not a full-time 
student due to the fact that he is registered 
for only 5 units, and does not pay the 
student activities fee. (Payment of the 
\ student activities fee is required by all 
graduate students taking 19 units or more, 
and is a commonly used measure to deter­
mine who is a full-time student.) Simon
also stated that the other official candi­
date, Richard Scherer, is not a registered 
student because he hasn’t paid his full 
tuition or his activities fee. The Student 
Government Constitution states that the 
President must be a full-time student at 
CMU, so the Special Election Appeals 
Board was convened to examine the 
appeal.
In the Saturday Board meeting, Edahl 
declared that SUPA considers him a 
full-time student and that he is, in fact, 
following the outline of that program and 
doing research. The central problem in the 
case of Edahl was that there is a difference 
between the University’s definition of a 
full-time student and that of SUPA. An­
swering charges that he is not a registered 
student, Richard Scherer explained that 
according to himself and his teachers, 
he is a full-time student, and what was 
being discussed was merely a technicality.
He attributed the present problem to the 
Financial Aid Office, saying he was “given 
a run-around”, which in turn created the 
present confusion. Scherer suggested 
several times that his bank in Harrisburg 
be called so that the situation could be 
rectified.
The Election Appeals Board decided, in 
executive session, that Rick Edahl was to 
be considered a full-time student and was 
thus qualified to run for president of the 
Student Government. Richard Scherer, 
however, was declared unqualified for the 
position and thus ineligible to run. Fur­
thermore, the Board decided that “since 
the voters as well as potential write-in 
candidates were misled by the acceptance 
of the nomination of the unqualified can­
didate, a new presidential election must 
be held. That election shall be held 
March 24 and 25.” The statement of the 
Board went on to say that all willing
candidates were given enough time to 
submit petitions before the first election, 
so only Edahl’s name will appear on the 
ballot in the second election. The Board 
also recommended to the Senate that their 
constitution adopt the registrar’s definition 
of a full-time student to prevent future 
mishaps of this kind.
RESULTS OF THE 
ACTIVITIES FEE REFERENDUM 
Students rejected the proposed increase 
of the student activities fee in the referen­
dum last week by a 60%-40% margin. 
Each of the individual Colleges, with the 
exception of GSIA (where only eight 
people voted), voted “no” on the fee 
hike by a substantial margin. In the other 
part of the plebiscite, students indicated 
that if the fee were to be raised, the 
preferable plan would be to raise it by 
$5 every other year.
English Department Search Begins
$ by Beth Kosis
According to the Middle States Evalua­
tion Visiting Committee, the English De­
partment is a slowly slipping into disorgan­
ization. This is not the fault of any one 
person or group, explains the Committee, 
and the situation is not hopeless if a new 
Department head is appointed to save the 
Department from lapsing into mediocrity. 
i > The present head, Arthur Eastman, is step­
ping down at the end of this semester.
The Visiting Committee recommended 
that the Dean and Department immediate­
ly form a search committe, and that 
this committee be supplied with the time 
and funds necessary for a broad and inten­
sive search. By January 19, Dean Crecine 
had appointed three Departmental repre­
sentatives, one H&SS representative, and
one general University representative to the 
Search Committee for the English Depart­
ment Head. With Professor A. Fred Sochat- 
off serving as Chairman and Professor Er­
win Steinberg acting as Committee Consul­
tant, Dean Crecine placed a budget of 
$2000 and secretarial services at the Com­
mittee’s disposal.
According to the Visiting Committee’s 
recommendation, the Search Committee is 
seeking candidates both on and off cam­
pus, but will not recommend an insider un­
til it is convinced that an insider is the best 
possible choice in the country. The Visiting 
Committee feels that an outsider could 
bring in a fresh point of view while “an 
insider might aggravate the wounds in the 
Department rather than heal them.” 
Though the Search Committee will not
overlook the possibility of current CMU 
faculty candidates, at the present time, on­
ly outsiders are under consideration.
The Search Committee began their 
search for candidates with a dual approach. 
An ad, which brought in approximately 
thirty-five replies, was published in the 
Chronicle of Higher Education. Other can­
didates were contacted after recommenda­
tions were made to the Committee.
The Middle States Visiting Committee 
made several suggestions as criteria for 
choosing the new head: “the head must be 
forcefully articulate in order to defend the 
claims of the humanities in what in many 
respects is an essentially hostile environ­
ment; the head must be as supportative of 
programs in writing as programs in litera-

WRCT: All Day, All Night
by Mary Ann Lawton
Many changes have been initiated this 
year at WRCT (88.3 FM),Camegie-Mellon’s 
radio station. Both the amount and type of 
programming have been increased, due 
largely to an influx of staff members.
At the beginning of the year, WRCT’s 
air-time was from six in the evening until 
midnight. As the staff grew, air time was 
expanded to 12-18 hours a day. A major 
goal was realized in mid-February when 
WRCT began broadcasting 24 hours a 
day.
During the morning broadcast, a 
Wake-Up Service is offered to CMU stu­
dents. By sending in his name, the time he 
wakes up, and the song he wants to hear, 
a student will wake up to “his song”. The 
station will try to fdl all requests.
Different types of programs have been 
created. There is a classical show on Sun­
day mornings, a show-tune show on Tues­
days, a country-western show, and others. 
“The Forbidden Fruit”, a weekly news 
magazine similar to “Sixty Minutes”, 
covers items of interest to the Oakland 
community on Sundays from 6 to 7 p.m. 
Attempts are also being made to introduce 
a daily serial, a weekly talk show, station 
editorials, and book, play, movie, and re­
cord reviews. Throughout these programs 
are comedy shows of varying lengths, and
Bill Dorley, General Manager of WRCT
with content similar to WDVE’s comedy 
hour.
WRCT has, in the past, conducted inter­
views with visiting celebrities and will con­
tinue to do so. They are also considering 
having a roving reporter armed with a tape 
recorder asking students the “Question of 
the day.” This will be, in the words of sta­
tion manager Bill Doorley, “a relevant (or 
at least interesting) question, and the best 
answers will be aired the next day.” A lack 
of equipment for remote broadcasting 
(tape recorders, microphones, etc.) is 
holding up this project.
One of WRCT’s biggest problems is 
that their signal barely covers the cam­
pus. Bill Doorley explained that FM is a 
line-of-sight signal. “It will travel in a 
straight line and the higher the antenna, 
the farther the signal travels. Buildings 
have a tendency to block the signals.” At 
the present time WRCT’s antenna is lo­
cated on the roof of Skibo. To improve 
coverage, it has been proposed to move the 
antenna either to the roof of Warner Hall, 
Morewood E-Tower, or the Fine Arts 
Building. Problems associated with these 
locations involve getting the signal from 
the station to the transmitter and antenna, 
and the cost of labor to bury a cable. If 
students are having trouble picking up
WRCT, they are encouraged to voice their 
complaints to help emphasize the need for 
moving the antenna.
WRCT is currently licensed to operate 
as a 10 watt educational station. This class 
of station may soon be phased out, which 
means that WRCT would have to start

CCCP Election 
Contested
by Joan Konkle
The Carnegie Commuter Council of 
Pittsburgh (CCCP) election, held last 
Wednesday and Thursday in Skibo, is 
being contested because candidates were 
seen campaigning at the polls. Among the 
people campaigning, says a reliable source, 
was Pat Kelly, who was subsequently 
elected president. The source says Kelly 
was sitting at the balloting desk, telling 
people to vote for him.
Another informed source said that the 
vagueness of the CCCP constitution is 
making protest difficult. The current CCCP 
president, George Bachner, is being con­
sulted to insure that the situation will be 
handled in the best possible way.

Election Surprises
Last week’s Student Senate Elections produced some sur­
prises after all. It appears that at least one of the Presidential 
candidates, and possibly both, are not full time students and 
therefore not qualified to run for the Presidency. While the 
Student Senate Constitution mandates that candidates must 
be full time students at Carnegie-Mellon, the definition of 
a full time student is not unambiguous.
The case of Richard Scherer is fairly dear cut. Over half 
way through the semester he has failed to pay the tuition 
and other fees owed the University. Since Scherer has not 
paid tuition, the Election Appeals Board ruled that he is 
unqualified to run. However, some controversy has arisen 
over the manner in which Student Senate found out that 
Scherer had failed to pay his bills.
The process involved the Registrar, Harold Whitehead, 
informing Dean Swank that Scherer had debts to the Uni­
versity. Swank, in turn, relayed the information to Student 
Senate. Senate Finance Chairman Don Simon, who has 
himself announced presidential aspirations, then challenged 
the validity of the election. Rick Edahl, who received the 
most votes in the Presidential race, has defended Scherer’s 
qualification to ru/i, charging the University Administration 
with interfering with the elections.
This charge makes little sense. It is clearly the argument of 
someone who does not want the election voided because he 
won. Any determination of a candidate’s full time status 
must be made by the administration since they do the book­
keeping.
The legitimacy of Edahl’s candidacy is not so dear cut. 
For undergraduates there is an easily applied criterion for 
defining a full time student: he must be taking at least 36 
units. Problems arise when this rule is applied to graduate 
students. As a graduate student, Edahl is currently registered 
for only five units. Some people have insisted that Edahl is 
not a full time student under the 36 unit rule. Strict enforce­
ment of this requirement would result in having most gradu­
ate students ineligible to run for the Presidency. Most student 
activities are already geared primarily towards undergraduates 
with little available for graduate students. To prevent gradu­
ate students from becoming involved in campus politics 
would only make things worse. Aside from the 36 unit rule, 
there are no other criteria for determining a student’s full 
time status. Clearly Student Senate must come up with 
some means of determining what constitutes full time status 
for a graduate student. With no definition available currently, 
the validity of the Edahl candidacy remains ambiguous. The 
Election Appeals Board has ducked the issue by recom­
mending that Student Senate have the Registrar determine
who is or is not a full time student.
In recent history it has not been that unusual to have 
Student Senate elections declared invalid. This is the 
fourth time in the last ten years that an election has been 
appealed with three of those appeals, including this latest one 
being successful. In the past, repeating elections has resulted 
in a much higher voter turnout. If this appeal results in more 
students becoming involved with the processes of campus 
politics and student government, then it will be good thing. 
Hopefully Student Senate will then be able to move beyond 
being bogged down in procedural questions and take up the 
important issues of student life that it should be concerned 
with.
This is the last time I'll have the use of these columns, so 
I’m going to indulge myself by dropping the editorial “we”.
/ would sincerely like to thank everyone / have hjd the 
opportunity to work with this last year, all the people who 
contributed so much, often going without sleep, and almost 
without grumbling, in order that you would have a news­
paper on Tuesdays. / especially want to note my apprecia­
tion for all the work of the TARTAN Editorial Board: Jim 
Harper, Joe Loughran, Joan Konkle, Randy Hunt, David 
Roussos, Elliot Popowitz, Bob Firm and Tom Binnie; one of 
the finest groups of people / have ever had the pleasure to 
work with.
To Paula Shu bock, who will be taking over as the “E in C”, 
and her new Editorial Board / wish the best of luck in the 
coming year and / hope that CMU and Pittsburgh treat them 
kindly.
To all the fine people / have come to know at CMU these 
last four years / would like to say, have a nice life.

I had a lengthy and construc­
tive meeting with the Senior Class 
in the Department of Design on 
March 7, 1977 regarding the 
renovation problems of the Facul­
ty Room in the College of Fine 
Arts for the Senior Show.
I expressed my regret and apo­
logized to the Senior Class for 
their unfulfilled expectation of 
having this room renovated for 
the Senior Show. The renovation 
project is still in the planning 
stage and according to early esti­
mates, it will cost approximately 
$36,000 ($26,000 for panelling 
and $10,000 for electrical work). 
This is far beyond what I thought 
it would be when we began to dis­
cuss it in the summer of 1976. 
There has been no agreement on 
the design of electrical work. The 
initial ideas were unsuitable.
I don’t think that the fusion of 
a short range expectation such as 
the end-of-the-year-show with a
long range plan to make the room 
more functional for multi-depart­
mental activities as well as faculty 
meetings, should have taken place. 
However, it has been my intention 
to make the room available to 
Design for the Senior Show in the 
same manner that it is made avai­
lable to the rest of the depart­
ments in the College of Fine Arts; 
that is to say, without renovation.
Renovation is a long range goal 
and should be based on an ap­
proved comprehensive plan. I am 
certain that such a plan does not 
yet exist. Information about ap­
proving or disapproving the fund­
ing is simply out of sequence and, 
at this stage, erroneous.

I am a Fine Arts student in my 
junior year here at CMU. What is 
so significant about this is that I
will soon be attempting to enter 
the art world. Although I will be 
contacting out-of-town galleries, I 
am also trying to establish connec­
tions with successful artists who 
visit this campus. Therefore, it is 
psychologically more sound for 
them to be pleased with the cam­
pus than not.
The other day I was accompa­
nying a visiting artist around the 
university. After leaving the Fine 
Arts Building, on our way to the 
crafts studios in the sub-basement 
of Doherty, we decided to stop in 
the Science Hall library to look 
for some references on the com­
position of acrylic paint. Ordinari­
ly, I would never have occasion to 
visit the Science Hall complex. On 
our way there, the elevator 
opened, revealing the main termi­
nal room of the Computer Center. 
Well, the room was filled with 
students waiting around like zom­
bies.. How the hell can I make a 
good impression on visiting artists 
if they think all CMU students are 
vegetables!! I don’t mean to pass

judgement on CIT students, but I 
don’t think they should call 
homosexuals “fruits.”
Neither Fruit nor Vegetable
Asserting Individuality 
Editor:
This is a response to “A junior 
who has his future in mind”, 
whose letter appeared in the 
March 8 addition of the Tartan. 
How can anyone with such a dis­
gusting outlook on life criticize 
homosexuals? This engineer ad­
mits that he is trying to sell him­
self to the corporate structure. 
Doesn’t he realize that this pros­
titution of himself is sickening? 
At least the homosexual is assert­
ing his individuality while the 
“junior with the future” is mere­
ly debasing his humanity by con­
forming to the corporate state.
This “junior” also mentions 
that CMU’s location is undesirable 
because of its nearness to the steel 
mills. But he longs to enter the 
structure that created those filthy, 
polluting entities, namely that 
corporate structure which con­
tains U.S. Steel, Jones & Laughlin, 
or whatever other corporation is 
down there showing their total 
disregard for their fellow man.
I, too, am a junior who has his 
future in mind. I am concerned 
with the dehumanizing effects the 
industrial state has on man. And 
by observing the University’s total 
emphasis on jobs and the resultant 
money-hungry student-whore, it is 
clear that CMU is helping bring 
about the fall of humanity.
Sam Grego
Passing Judgement 
Editor:
A recent issue of the Tartan 
contained a letter to the editor, 
signed, “A junior with his future 
in mind.” It is ironic that the 
writer claims he does not mean to 
pass judgement on homosexuality, 
when in fact, this is exactly what 
his letter proceeds to do. The stu­
dent claims he is concerned about 
finding a job after graduation, 
that he is concerned about the ad­
verse opinions other people (i.e. 
prospective employers) might 
have on CMU, and also, that the 
presence of flaunting homosexua­
lity on campus will ruin whatever 
chances he might have of finding 
a job.
I cannot understand why this 
person has allowed himself to suf­
fer for so long here admidst, as 
he puts it, “steel mill smoke, use­
less H&SS courses, and, of course, 
open displays of homosexuality.” 
Was this perhaps, what attracted 
him to CMU? So long as the stu­
dent persists in degrading the uni­
versity for its location, the quality 
of its courses, and the sexual pre­
ferences of its students, he cannot 
possibly hope to convince corpor­
ate representatives that the educa­
tion he has received here has more 
than adequately prepared him for 
the position for which he is apply­
ing. How does one expect others 
to think highly of CMU unless 
they do themselves? The fears
expressed by this student are typi­
cal of undergraduate students, yet 
it is impractical to suggest that 
they be changed.
I doubt very much that a repre­
sentative, upon seeing, “two men 
kissing and hugging” would con­
clude that “all CMU students are 
fruits.” It is equally as ridiculous 
to assume that one would con­
clude, upon seeing two black men 
strolling past Doherty Hall with 
books, that all CMU students are 
blacks. My own conclusion is that 
either Junior is very biased against 
a person’s right to choose his or 
her own sexual partner(s) or that 
perhaps he is concerned about his 
own closet homosexual tenden­
cies, and is afraid of being ex­
posed as such. My advice to him is 
to stop making such a big deal 
over nothing. Or ... if you can’t 
beat ‘em - join ‘em.

Money Grubbing 
Editor:
This letter is in response to the 
person who signed himself in youi 
letters column as a “junior who 
has his future in mind.” He was 
concerned that if an interviewer 
visiting the campus were to see 
two men kissing each other, the 
interviewer would conclude that 
all CMU students, faculty, staff, 
stray dogs, etc., were gay, and 
consequently that no CMU grad­
uates could be considered hirea- 
ble. The mentality of this “jun­
ior” was displayed when he said 
he didn’t “mean to pass judge­
ment on homosexuality” but 
labelled homosexuals as “fruits” 
whose display of affection “out­
raged” him.. Well, “junior,” for­
tunately not all interviewers are 
money-grubbing WASP bigots 
whose sole concern is their fi­
nancial well-being without regard 
for the free expression of other 
individuals, as you seem to be. 
Not all interviewers are so inse­
cure as to infer that two members 
of the same sex who show affec­
tion for each other must be gay, 
nor would all of them conclude 
that if two students are gay all 
must be, nor would they all feel 
self-righteous indignation about 
the existence of people unlike 
themselves. And, as a budding en­
gineer, what practical method do 
you propose for ensuring'that 
no interviewer see an alarming 
sight on this campus? Shall we 
enlist our efficient security force 
to police the degree and form of 
affection which people may show 
to one another? And should we 
go even further and cater to your 
moralistic whims of what the 
typical interviewer’s sensitivities 
are? Shall we ban all beer blasts 
and expell all students of Polish 
descent? Shall we institute prayer 
breakfasts and “Anita Bryant 
Day”? Perhaps you would be 
more comfortable at Annapolis, 
where no H&SS-type courses 
could intrude on your medieval 
conception of how people ought 
to behave or exist. And finally, 
I hope you will excuse me for 
labelling you a bigot, but the 
proper response to “faggot” is 
always “bigot”!
A CMU Scientist
What Next?
Editor:
As a member of CMU’s Friends 
of A. C. L. U., it has come to my 
attention that a Senate Bill is be­
ing proposed in the General As­
sembly of Pennsylvania which 
clearly discriminates against and 
intrudes on an individual’s rights 
to his or her own sexual freedom. 
The proposed Senate Bill No. 83 
fosters the legalization of dis­
crimination against acknowledged 
and practicing homosexuals. This 
bill calls for restrictions in the 
hiring practices of governmental 
agencies, disallowing any vacant 
positions to be filled by homo­
sexuals or other persons con­
victed of sex crimes. These job 
positions entail; 1.) State Police­
men 2.) State Correctional Guards
3.) Correctional Counselors 4.) 
State Probation officers 5.) Of­
ficers, nurses and staff at any 
State Institution that is involved 
with mental illness or mental re­
tardation 6.) The officers and 
staff of any State Institution that 
are rehabilitation centers for the 
physically handicapped.
This Bill states, ‘This act is 
deemed to be and shall be con­
strued to be a sound exercise of 
those residual police powers in­
herent within this Commonwealth 
and necessary for the public 
health and welfare and safety of 
the citizens of the Common­
wealth. Such a statement in­
dicates that the prevailing at­
titudes of a large part of our 
society ; that homosexuality is 
unhealthy and contagious. What 
evidence is there is to indicate 
that Homosexuals are any more 
detrimental to those in their care 
than Heterosexuals? Since this Bill 
only pertains to those brave 
souls who exercise their First 
Amendment rights and announce 
their sexual preference; what 
merit if any will this Bill will 
create since most people tend to 
keep their sexual lives to them­
selves expecially if its disclosure 
means a loss of economic sup­
port?
If one were to go about tack­
ling the problem of sexual abuse 
in our institutions it might be 
more practical to punish those 
who misuse their authority in­
stead of the innocent. Since it is 
common knowledge that inmates 
in institutions commit blatant 
rapes, the impetus to the solution 
seems to be the exercising of more 
inmate control and not the staff 
themselves.
In a day and age where en­
lightened social and psychological 
findings explain away many of the 
misconceptions we have about our 
‘sexuality’ it is time for progress, 
not regression. Instead of Bill No. 
83 being passed the public should 
advocate the repealing of such 
backward and narrow-minded 
Pennsylvania Statutes as No. 
94501 passed on June 24 of 1939 
P. L. 872 9501. This Statute 
states that fines not exceed­
ing $5,000.00 or imprisonment 
not exceeding (10) years or both 
can be given for the following; 
“Whoever carnally knows in any 
manner any animal or bird, or
carnally knows any male or 
female person by the anus or 
by or with the mouth, or whoever 
voluntarily submits to such carnal 
knowledge, is guilty of sodomy.” 
It is possible that whomever 
wrote the above statute hap­
pened to belong to the Auda- 
bon Society. In any case I think it 
is about time Legislators stop 
impressing their psuedo-moralities 
on us and start worrying about 
their own.

“Girl Roundballers Fall on 
Hard Times”? GIRL ROUND­
BALLERS FALL ON HARD 
TIMES?? What kind of headline 
is this? Why does the TARTAN 
allow such offensive, meaningless 
quasi-cuteness to pass for a head­
line about the CMU Women’s 
Basketball team? (Has the TAR­
TAN ever even considered using 
the phrase “Boy Roundballers” to 
describe the Men’s Basketball 
team?) In the same issue (3/8/77), 
the article about the Men’s Bas­
ketball team is titled, “Hoopsters 
Downed in NCAA.” Agreed, this 
is not as eye-catching, but it is 
certainly more understandable 
and dignified.
I hope that, in future issues, 
the TARTAN will show women’s 
sports the same respect that it 
naturally, unconsciously shows to 
men’s sports.

On Student Senate
Editor:
I quite agree with the views ex­
pressed in Editorial of the Tartan 
(of March 8th) about the role of 
the Student Government on this 
campus. I also share with you the 
concern that the students in gen­
eral are so disinterested in func­
tioning of the Student Govern­
ment that in the past few of them 
exercised their vote in the elec­
tions.
I think that one of the reasons 
for this lack of communication 
between the Student Senate and 
the students. The Constitution of 
the Student Government does not 
provide for a general-body meet­
ing. Other channels of communi­
cations like posters or the col­
umns of the Tartan, have not 
been used very effectively yet. 
The result is that students in gen­
eral have very little idea of what 
the Student Government is doing. 
On the other hand, senators have 
problems ascertaining the majori­
ty opinion on campus, except 
through referendums which, as it 
is can be held only with an elec­
tion [like the one on campus 
calendar or the one on activities 
fee].
In this matter the previous se­
nate has failed to take enough 
initiative. Last semester a propo­
sal was put forward to brief the 
Tartan News Staff every week or 
hand over the minutes of the 
weekly meeting to the Tartan to 
be reported as such. This propo­
sal was agreed to, at least in prin­
ciple, by the Tartan and the 
Senate. However, I am sorry to 
say that we have not moved in 
that direction yet.
I hope that the new Senate 
gives serious thought to its func­
tioning and takes steps to estab­
lish an effective communication 
with students.

More On Student Senate
Editor:
Your last editorial, “Is Senate 
Needed?”, raised several valid 
points, it however also contained 
several inaccuracies.
1) Recent elections have had 
voter turn-outs approaching 25%, 
rather than the 10% figure you 
stated.
2) Senators are elected on a 
stagger-system, to serve a term of 
one full academic year, in order 
to keep the Senate experienced. 
This semester, for example, nine 
of the twenty-one Senate seats 
were up for election, the others 
being held by Senators elected 
during the Fall semester.
3) Appointees of the Student 
Government serving on faculty or 
administration committees are re­
quired to discuss agenda and min­
utes with the Senate, to better 
inform each of the current cam­
pus-wide views. They are not left 
to represent the Student Body 
without prior knowledge of cam­
pus opinion.
4) Senate has served in more 
decisions than you acknowledge. 
Lack of awareness may be due to 
the Senate’s acting upon concerns 
while they are current, instead of 
waiting to hold a referendum on 
each matter. Senators are as­
sumed to consult with members 
of their constituencies on all 
major points, and time is always 
provided for this polling. Since 
the Senate minutes are available 
at the Skibo Information Desk 
and are mailed to the campus 
media, I assume that in your case, 
you have simply forgotten recent 
history.
I look forward to correspond­
ing more in-depth views of Stu­
dent Government at a later date, 
in the hope that you may transmit 
them to the Student Body.

What Would Anita Bryant Say? 
Editor:
I can’t understand the viewpoint 
of last week’s “Junior with his 
future on his mind.” After all, its 
Springtime and boys will be boys. 
The Junior had his future on his 
mind and those men were
thinking about shorter time
periods, like that night. They were 
just concerned with different 
types of jobs. My advice to the 
Junior is: try it, you’ll like it.

broadcasting at somewhere around 100 
watts. This would involve purchasing a new 
antenna and transmitter, and would in­
crease the need for more FCC-licensed 
first-class operators. As a 100 watt educa­
tional station, WRCT follows minimal FCC 
regulations. If they do increase their 
power, they would be required to broad­
cast a minimum of 8 hours per day, which 
would require personnel to broadcast 
during the summer months.
WRCT currently has approximately 50 
staff members, 30 of whom are on-the-air 
personnel. But more staff members are 
needed, especially in the areas of music, 
news, engineering, and production. (A 
degree in engineering is not required to 
work in engineering). If anyone is inter­
ested in being on the staff, even if their 
only ability is typing, drop by the station 
in Skibo and let them know.
According to WRCT’s 1977 
programming proposal, the purpose of 
WRCT is to serve the campus community, 
which includes students. faculty, 
administration, security, and the physical 
plant. The station wants feedback from
their listeners as to what they like or don’t 
like about the station, and would welcome 
any suggestions about types of 
programming they would like to hear. 
WRCT suggests that people call in requests, 
leave notes in the WRCT mailbox at Skibo 
Information Desk, or come down to the 
station. In the near future, they will 
circulate a survey on campus to find out 
musical preferences, and when and why 
people listen to what they do.
WRCT is actively working to better 
serve the campus community: several mem­
bers of the staff will attend an Inter-colleg- 
iate Broadcasting System conference in 
Washington, D.C. next month to try to get 
ideas on how to improve the station, and 
the Tartan now runs a column announcing 
special events for the coming week.
As Bill Doorley said, the WRCT staff is 
a group of high-spirited people who are in­
terested in their work and in serving the 
campus community. If anyone is interested 
in helping them or criticizing them, get in 
touch. Their phone number is 621-9728 
(which is 621-WRCT) or campus extension 
8883.

Peeping Tom
RETURNS!
by Sherry Siegel
The spring-like temperatures Pittsburgh 
enjoyed those few days in mid-February 
brought more than just relief from freezing 
temperatures and biting winds—it also 
brought the return of a Peeping Tom to 
Doherty House.
Sue Altman, a resident of the first floor 
of A-tower, said that on a warm day about 
two weeks ago, she saw a man standing on 
the path behind her building and peering 
into her window. When she walked towards
the window to see who he was and what he 
was doing, he left. Altman said she was sus­
picious of the incident because he was an 
older man and didn’t live in Doherty 
House.
This is the second report of a Peeping 
Tom from a resident of Doherty House. 
A similar episode had been reported at the 
beginning of the school term. Security has 
been notified.

Cyert Teaches ElA Course
by Phil Burda
Check under the names of teachers for 
this semester, and you might find a surprise 
under the class of Elements of Industrial 
Administration: Richard Cyert. That’s
right, our university president. Why does a 
President of a major university teach an un­
dergraduate intro course? “It’s important 
for a president to teach, just as he does re­
search,” said President Cyert. Research, 
too? “You just have to schedule your life.” 
In fact, President Cyert would like to teach 
after he steps down as university president. 
Dr. Cyert feels eight to ten years is enough 
to be president, and he would like to con­
tinue in teaching and research after he 
comes down to the level of mortal faculty 
members.
President Cyert keeps a busy schedule, 
indeed. “I’m one of those people who like 
a combination of things. I learned that a 
long time ago, and I like my life very much 
because it is a combination. I like adminis­
tration, fund-raising, worrying about im­
proving the university, teaching, and re­
search, but what I really like is doing a 
combination of them. That’s something I 
learned early on in my life; if I do just 
one or two of these things I tend to get 
depressed, whereas when I have wide vari­
ety of them, I feel better about life. And 
that’s the kind of life I set out to build for 
myself. That’s why I became department 
head and dean.”
How about Dr. Cyert, the teacher? “I 
like teaching undergraduates. There’s a 
kind of newness of knowledge you can 
bring to students. You get this feeling of 
someone discovering new knowledge that 
you don’t get with graduate students.
“I like teaching because it gives me a
chance to meet students as an instructor. 
There’s a different relationship between 
students you have in the classroom and 
yourself and me as president to the stu­
dents.
“One of the things I like to do is not 
stand up and teach. I like to carry on my 
classes by a discussion effort. I like to raise 
questions that may bear upon the readings, 
or I like to bring up cases about a situation 
in a business firm. My method of carrying 
on a class is to raise questions. My idea is 
that people should be doing something in 
a classroom rather than sitting passively, 
taking in knowledge. One of the secrets 
of teaching is that you wind up learning 
more than the students do, because you’re 
doing something. I’d like to see more class­
es carried on that way.
“One of the things that’s really satisfy­
ing as a teacher is seeing what happens to 
some of your students. I came here in 1948 
to work on my Ph. D. I had some classes in 
Industrial Management , which was what 
AMS used to be called, and I had an excel­
lent class of students. I was very close to 
them. One of my former business students 
is dean of the business school at Cornell; 
another one is a partner in a major CPA 
firm; another is a vice-president of a busi­
ness firm. Some of my Ph. D. students have 
become professors. This is very rewarding.”
What are some of the things you learn 
in the classroom that carry over to every­
day life? “Your own dedication and inten­
sity of interest in the clas determines the 
interest of the students, and I think this 
same lesson goes through in all sorts of 
walks of life. When you feel strongly about 
something and have some enthusiasm, it’s 
possible to get a lot of other people excit­

APPLICATIONS ARE NOW BEING ACCEPTED FOR RESIDENT
CMU summer counselors
June 27 — August 5, 1977
The Summer Studies Office of 
CMU is looking to hire a staff 
of resident counselors to co­
ordinate and supervise a stu­
dent life program for high 
school students attending 
the University's Advanced 
Placement/Early Admissions, 
Fine Arts Pre-College and 
Project Upward Bound Programs.
Counselors must be energetic 
and willing to live and work 
closely with the programs'
I participants. Compensation 
includes room and board for 
the six-week session, June 27 
through August 5.
E Applications along with detailed 
job descriptions are available in the 
Admissions Office 
first floor of Warner Hall.
ed. If you go into something in a half­
hearted way and say, okay, this is some­
thing I have to do and I’m not very inter­
ested in it, everybody around you suffers. 
Teaching is a nice microcosm of the world 
in that respect.
“Somehow there are people who live 
who are not really involved. I don’t under­
stand people like that. I’ve never been able 
to live that way myself.
“I think also the whole relationship with 
people comes out in a classroom where you 
can relax people and get a good relation­
ship with them. One of the things that 
bothers me about the classroom is that 
there tends to be tension or maybe even a 
feeling of hostility, between a student and 
a teacher, partly because grades are going 
to be handed out. I always try to make it 
clear in my classes that Pm not grading on 
any curve - If everyone does a good job, 
everyone can have an A.
“That is exactly the problem you have 
in a university. I would not like to run a 
university if I felt the faculty and students 
were my enemies. My aim is to try to make 
clear my objectives and try to help every­
body learn these lessons and achieve these 
goals. The classroom is an interesting social 
organization. There are things you can 
gather in a class that you will carry over 
the rest of your life.”
Finally, President Cyert made an obser­
vation on the difference between being a 
president of a university and a president of 
a corporation. “As president, I feel ex­
tremely responsible for the university. 
When I walk along the sidewalk, and 
there’s a can or something on the sidewalk, 
I put it in the wastebasket. My wife and I 
pledged a hundred thousand dollars for the
fund drive. That’s not the way you operate 
if you work for a business. We’re commit­
ted to this organization, to this way of life. 
It’s a total commitment
So, the next time you see a man picking 
up a beer can from the sidewalk, or glance 
up to the majestic heights of Warner Hall, 
keep in mind that the university president 
of one of the nation’s top engineering and 
business schools could be your professor 
next fall.

ture; the head should have some back­
ground, or at least interest, in science and 
technology ; and most of all, the new head 
must be tough.” The Search Committee 
is using this criteria with additional re­
quirements. “The candidates must have an 
earned doctorate in English, an interest in 
good teaching, and demonstrated experi­
ence in administration,” explains Professor 
Sochatoff. “We are also following Affirma­
tive Action guidelines.” The committee 
now has both male and female candidates 
and no age limits have been set.
The Search Committee’s narrowing list 
of fifteen possible candidates represents 
various sections of the country. All of the
candidates are presently teachers or admin­
istrators at universities from coast to coast. 
The perfect time for all CMU students to 
become involved in the search, according 
to Dean Crecine and Professor Sochatoff, 
is when the Committee starts bringing can­
didates to campus. “Our five or six final 
candidates will each be on campus for 
two or three days,” explains Professor 
Sochatoff, “and we want them to talk to 
groups of students.” Candidate interviews 
and campus visits are expected to begin 
at the end of March. The new Head of the 
English Department will be instated by the 
beginning of the 1977 Fall semester.

Jones Industrial Average slipped down 
more than five points. Trading volume re­
mained light, reflecting investor indecision. 
The business community was encouraged 
by the IBM announcement that it hadn’t 
received the 4 million shares of its own 
stock that it had offered to purchase from 
stockholders at $280 a share. This indicates 
that people feel S280 is a relatively cheap 
price for IBM stock and that they believe 
IBM will continue to grow as it has in the 
past. IBM is the bench-mark for growth 
stocks and its action is usually carried over 
to other growth stocks. Soft drink stocks 
which were initially hard hit when the 
FDA proposed to baiv saccharin, recovered 
most of their losses the next day. Diet 
beverage sales account for about 10% of 
the $10 billion industry. The price of gold
is approaching the $150 an ounce barriei 
as it sells at its highest price in 18 months.

TH€ WAY OUTSIDE
by Mark Aksoy
I don't remember going to sleep last night. It's 
been a long day and I don't remember much of 
that either. How long has this clutter of unfinish­
ed assignments, textbooks and notes been assum­
ing my vision? And why is problem 12-7 such an 
enigma?
Two hours later in a burst of mental anguish 
I cried out, "Alright! That does it! I've had it! 
I'm getting out here before I go insane!" I jumped 
up from my desk, threw on my jacket, and made 
for the door, but my conscience demanded to be 
heard:
—Now wait a minute! You just can't go jaunt­
ing over to the Tartan Grill at this time of night 
.. .not with another calculus test coming. . !— 
"Another calculus test! . . .We just had one 3 
days ago!! No . . .this time I mean it. . .I'm get­
ting out and not just for a medium-size coffee and 
onion rings but out!
I flew down the stairs and skidded to a stop 
just outside the main entrance. My conscience 
caught up with me, trying hard to avoid laughing:
— You mean, you're going to venture complete­
ly outside of the CMU community?. .. You?... 
Hah! You don't even know what lies beyond 
Flagstaff Hill! —I don't even think I know what

A
TO STAY
by Jeff Zas/ow
"I don't want to leave here." He lamented as 
he undid his tie and sat down with me at the grill 
I was about to ask, "How was it?" but I didn't. 
An interview is an interview is an interview. 
Something else was on his mind.
He continued. "I'm happy here. Happy with 
this make believe environment. Eating at Skibo. 
Going to 2210 for a movie. I' m used to it."
"But you never wanted to leave high school 
also; and you left." I tried counter-exampling 
him, but failed.
"True." He nodded. "But this place is a perfect 
substitute for high school. Instead of study hall, 
we play frisbee. We just moved sex from the cars 
into the dorm rooms."
He looked around, contemplating the misery 
of his situation. Then he looked quite frankly 
at me and said. "Maybe I'm not mature enough."
"No." I decided. "That's not your problem." 
He took off his jacket, and waved to another Sen­
ior he knew across the room." I still want to be a 
kid. And come September, I'll be a man in the 
work force; a goddamn wage earner."
In all of my sophmoric wisdom, I sympathized 
with him, but lacked empathy. I still had two 
years as a kid. So I didn't look him straight in 
the face and asked. "But isn't that what you
spent 20 thousand bills and four years of your button, 
life to achieve. A place in the work force?" happen
Again he nodded, and unbuttoned his top shirt
'Of course. But I never thought it would 
never thought that I'd ever leave CMU."

lies beyond the next 2 blocks, I realized and be­
gan to feel intensely curious. I told my conscience 
where it could go and peered into the gloom won­
dering which direction to take. Did it really make 
that much difference?
The broken sidewalk led on into darkness and 
within minutes I was on unfamiliar terrain- a re­
sidential sidestreet. These houses are only a few 
hundred feet from the dorm but the people in 
them don't even know I exist, it occurred to me. 
And moreover they couldn't care less. I passed a 
succession of illuminated picture windows nestled 
behind trees or bushes; some showed empty sets 
of living room furniture, others displayed a few 
seated people reading newspapers or watching 
TV. At one point, an outcropping in the ancient 
sidewalk tripped me into a garbage can and start­
ed a dog barking somewhere. "To think I was 
once part of this whole scene," I muttered and
turned left onto Fifth Ave. Soon problem 12-7 
re-entered my mind. My thoughts became a maze 
of figures and variables as I walked towards Oak­
land, and suddenly the answer hit me head- on.
"Why, of course!'.', I shouted, "the 2's cancel
out leaving x2 equal to x!"
"You having trouble with your income tax 
too?"
I wheeled around to see a very middle-aged 
man waiting at the bus stop I'd just passed.
"God Almighty," he continued, "I spent 
weeks trying to figure out that darn form... 
finally took it to the IRS office and—"
I slunk off rather embarrassed. Up ahead was a 
newspaper machine. What was happening in this 
world? I wondered and bent over to read the 
headlines. DOG SURVIVES SCALP TRANS­
PLANT screamed the late edition of the Press. 
Below that: I-79 BRIDGE DEVELOPS 5TH 
CRACK and below that: PRESIDENT CARTER 
PROCLAIMS ENERGY SHORTAGE PERMA­
NENT.
Beyond lay downtown Oakland. People sat on 
sidewalks, spat on sidewalks and police cars cruis­
ed by slowly, keeping watch over all. Intent on 
staying off the beaten track I entered the South 
Side. The street I soon found myself on had no 
lights, no sidestreets, and no end. The ocassional 
beat of footsteps signaled someone approaching 
me, and my nerves would repeatedly be set on 
edge as I waited for some loathsome monster to 
materialize out of the darkness. But in its place 
was always a mere person just as miserable and 
apprehensive looking as myself.
I reversed course back towards the downtown 
section and leisurely obscruved a drunken shoving 
match outside a tavern. The eruption of sirens 
howling and ripping somewhere in the vicinity 
gave the surroundings an unreality I found hard 
to swallow. It was finally time to retreat, I con­
cluded and returned my steps back to Forbes.
The traffic lights kept up their lonely light 
show at the Morewood Ave. intersection and a 
few cars were still up and about busily seeking 
their destinations. In an exhausted daze I stepped 
out onto the vacant expanse of Forbes Avenue. 
The sodium arc lamps made it a brilliantly lit 
strip—almost a stage. I walked along one of the 
white lines and stopped to bow to imaginary 
applause. Thank-you. . .thank-you .. .you're too 
kind . . .and now with my last reserves of strength 
I hope to make it to the Science Hall vending 
machines before I die of hunger. Thank-you .. . 
The applause refused to die and I continued my 
hypnotic tight-rope walk on the white line.
Suddenly a blaring wah-wah noise shattered the 
calm and I looked up toward the intersection in 
time to see a ambulance screaming through a red 
light and bearing down on me. Almost by reflex I 
scampered over to the sidewalk and up the steps 
to Warner Hall. I was back in the Inside World 
now.
It was darker within the campus grounds and 
the constellations overhead caught my eyes turn­
ing them skyward. "Those 2 bright stars there are 
actually planets", a friend told me a couple nights 
ago, pointing them out. " Draw lines between 
them and the Earth and you have a giant cosmic 
triangle representing the plane of the entire solar 
system!"
Suddenly I saw both planets again and the 
world of CMU seemed to be travelling in a very 
private orbit along with the worlds of Jupiter and 
Venus around a sun which would rise in 3 hours. I 
looked around. Things seemed very straightfor­
ward and predictable in this world. I had a test 
tomorrow (today) and maybe I should study for 
it. That was all.
Science Hall grew nearer and I visualized a piz- 
za-burger cooking in the microwave oven and hot 
instant coffee scaulding my tongue. Then I made 
my last mental observation of the night. For some 
reason the one unchanging feature of all worlds 
would always be the lousy taste of a typical cup 
of coffee.«

"Well, than you've been living in a dream." I 
said, with a tone that was harsher than necessary.
There was a wierd silence for a while. Actually 
the juke box and the Tartan Grill regulars were 
making a racket, but at our table, contemplation 
made for a calm stillness . I ate my reuben, and he 
watched me. He'd had the Senior banquet two 
nights before. Was that his last supper? Was he 
hungry? I figured he was.
So I offered him whatever interested him . 
I'd gotten my dollar-seventy-five, but only need 
half of that to satisfy my appetite. He looked on 
my tray and declined. It was as if he wanted 
something exotic. I joked with him and told him 
that after he becomes a man of substance, he'd 
be able to eat real food. I lacked the cleverness to 
excite him enough to be happy with his future. 
So I remained quiet until he decided that he 
wanted to talk again.
"There was this auto mechanic on the bus. 
Greasy like the inside of a Mazola jar." He said, 
"He was about my age. Maybe a little younger. 
But he didn't care if he got the seat greasy. Be­
cause he's a lousy busrider whatever that means. 
He takes his 61a, b, or c, everyday and he's happy 
happy. And he probably has some greasy wife 
picking up his clothes around his house. Not that 
it helps cause his house looks like the inside of a 
garage..
"What's your point?" I interrupted.
He ignored me and continued elaborating^ 
"And that guy will have a set of slimy kids that 
will never make it to college. But they'll be proud 
of their Daddy. Daddy the tax payer."
"What's your point?" I asked again.
"I don't know." He said, and I truly believe 
him." I guess it's just that that guy is already 
adjusted to everything. He's already got his 
place and an easy lifestyle. I'm unsure and per­
haps I'm afraid I won't fit."
He'd lost me somewhere, most probably at the 
beginning of his saga. I knew that I looked puzzl­
ed, and I knew that he'd recognize the puzzle­
ment in my face, so it didn't surprise me when he 
reitereated his thoughts.
"It's kind of like I was foolish all these years. 
Maybe I was putting off the real world. I wanted 
some more years to fool around. But that me­
chanic had guts. He jumped right in. And I bet he 
is happy riding that Trafford bus every morning."
"I thought it was a 61?" I asked, trying to add 
some humour to the heaviness of the discussion.
"Whatever it was!" He said, disgusted more at 
his dissatisfaction with himself then at my dim 
attempt at comedy.
So I tried again to inspire him. "You came to 
CMU for a reason. You've got a trade now that is 
going to put you thirty car lenghts ahead of that 
greaseball mechanic. And as for your wanting to 
stick around here, that's understandable. But we 
reach a point, and then we move on.. ."
"And I've reached my point?" He interrupted.
"Not your point. The established point. You've 
gotten to 16th grade, and now it's time to leave 
the land of learning." I explained.
"But this land I can cope with." He said, seri­
ously. "It's the jungle, the wilderness, that scares 
„ . / i me.
Before I allowed myself to lash out at him for 
his marrowless unmanly statements. I thought 
about his predicament. His parents would no 
longer support him. Of course the loans had to be 
paid back. And.yes, he really couldn't call himself 
a kid. But there were other reasons.
"I'll no longer have friends like I have here." 
He said, right about the moment I ran out of
reasons. That point I could not argue, so I didn't 
try.
I had long since finished my reuben by this 
time, and since neither of us ever smoked, we 
really had no reason to remain there. In a way I 
wanted to stay with him. Support him. I knew 
that the road ahead was pure excitement for him, 
And I felt that it was my duty to make him aware 
of that fact. I also understood that I was one of 
the friends that he'd never have again. I would be 
one of the kids that he was leaving to become a 
man. It used to be that boys became men when 
they left for war. In these peaceful times, it'salot 
harder becoming an adult-
He stood up and shook my hand, something 
that he hadn't done ever before, except perhaps 
to be comical. Yet he was serious, I knew. He 
looked at me, and smiled. It was a weak smile, 
but it assured me that he'd be alright.
He passed by the pinball machines, not even
thinking of playing his favorite; the baseball 
game. I suppose that he was leaving the pinball 
back with me, in the pre-man stage.
I wasn't worried about him. Christ, he'd make 
it. I was sure of that. I was more concerned about 
the troubled time ahead until he got himself "to­
gether".
I picked up my books, figuring on heading over 
to Hunt for a while. I had planned to read Time 
and Newsweek before I started "booking". But 
then I decided against going to the library. I 
headed back for the dorm, and I might have even 
run back, except I had all those books. I didn't 
want to read Time or Newsweek. Let the outside 
world sit in those magazines and rot. As a soph- 
more, I still had over two years to be young. I 
wanted to enjoy my luckiness in the fantasy 
world of CMU. I found myself at a party, and 
participated in something that would not last 
forever. . .being a kid.B

ARATHGTIC
by A. H. Orion
I had gotten 3 hours of sleep in the last two 
nights, and I was just about to go to bed when the 
editor entered my room. He asked me to write an 
article for Folio. At first I wanted to tell him ex­
actly what he could do with next weeks paper, 
but he had a look on his face that was a cross be­
tween a three month old puppy, and Charlie 
Brown after losing his 1,000th game in a row 
(The new record). How could I refuse?
He told me that the topic would be "the out­
side world". Who dreams up these things; What 
the hell am I going to write? What's so great 
about the outside world ? They have Jimmy Can 
ter; we have Peter Yacoe. We have Dick Cyert, 
they had Scrooge. They have Park Schenley; 
we've got Skibo . Nothing special, Right?
They had the great stock market crash of 1929;
we have the great crash of the 360, DAILY. They 
moonlight; we double major. Outside they worry 
about death; Inside it's retension: They have taxa­
tion; we have tuition. They put in overtime; we 
have evening classes* Unions or fraternities; in­
sane asylums or drafting rooms; Woodward and 
Bernstein or Zimmermann and Seigle. Things are 
pretty much the same all over.
But there are differences , with the outside world. 
What kind of remarks would four guys living to­
gether receive out there? Pianos are never dis­
mantled. People pay to see movies. People 
answer telephones. The 'double E' is a commuter 
train, and 85 -eleven is last weeks grocery bill.
One thing that remains constant is apathy. 
People don't give a damn out there, and 15% of 
the student population votes here at CMU. I think 
I'll be apathetic too. I'm too tired. Let someone 
else write, it. I'm going to bed.

ENTERTAINMENTUTOPIA CONCERNED WITH MYSTICISM
by David C. Lucas
Perhaps Todd Rundgren and his band, 
Utopia, were trapped in the Pyramid of 
Cheops for a week with only Lord of the 
Rings and a 1945 Life magazine for com­
pany. That would explain Utopia’s latest 
release, Ra, (named after the Egyptian sun 
god.) Many rock groups, such as Earth, 
Wind and Fire and Yes, are concerned with 
communicating a certain mysticism. InTfa, 
Utopia is involved with the commune-with- 
the-four-elements mysticism which domin­
ates many non-Christian religions. The con­
cepts of the new album are closely related 
to the East Indian philosophy of the 1975 
Rundgren album, Initiation.
Ra, Utopiz’s third album, features pro- 
ducer-guitarist Todd Rundgren, keyboard 
and synthesizer player Roger Powell, (who 
joined the group on the pr.eceeding album, 
Another Live,) and. John Wilcox, on drums 
and percussion. The elimination of two 
keyboardists and the replacement of bass­
ist John Siegler by Kasim Sulton has pared 
the group down to four members. Surpris­
ingly, the reduction in size hasn’t made 
Utopia any less noisy. . . •
A tune called Hiroshima is typical of 
Rundgren-induced noise. The silly heavy- 
metal number beginswith electronic sami- 
sans and end with a big bang and sizzling 
noises.
Hiroshima shares side two with an “elec­
trified fairytale.” Singring and the Glass 
Guitar is narrarated by engineer John Hol­
brook, whose voice resembles the Irish 
Spring soap commerical man sped up to 
78 r. p. m. This harmless Tolkienesque 
rock tale tells of four adventurers who 
must retrieve the four keys which will re­
lease Singring, the guardian spirit of a com­
munity called Harmony, (probably not in 
Pennsylvania.) Singring was imprisoned by 
evil forces, “and there are. always evil 
forces in such tales,” in a glass guitar, 
Nifty British-tinged musical paragraphs are 
sung by each of the members of the group. 
Action scenes are less than adaquatelyjjor-i
trayed with percussion, synthesizer and/or 
guitar interludes.
Side one of Ra begins with a metallic 
Introduction written by Bernard Herr­
mann, Mountaintop and Sunrise. This seg­
ues into a forceful Rundgren tune called 
Communion with the Sun. Communion
with the Sun uses loudness and distortion 
to an advantage, producing Yes-like image 
of sun-soaked valleys. The goup backs 
Rundgren with rich but heavy-metal vocals.
Magic Dragon Theater written by Rund­
gren and new comer Sulton, is typical of 
earlier Rundgren material. A circus atmos­
phere is created by ragtime piano and the 
inclusion of audience noises Bits of ad­
venture and western theatre dialogue are 
also sandwiched in. Lines such as “Look to 
your right where a gentleman sat/There sits 
a monkey in a tall silk hat/That lady on the 
left is now a pumpkin pie/ that’s when you 
notice that your chair is flying,” are handl­
ed in the very compatible falsettos, of 
rundgren and Sulton.
'John Wilcox’s high school-rock-band 
voice and the frenetic distorted guitars of 
Jealousy make it a viscious little rocker. A 
lilting guitar-voice interlude separates the 
two grinding verses of this testimonial to 
the toubles of a “love gone green.”
The only mellow tune on the album is 
Roger Powell and Kasim Sulton’s Eternal 
Love. Sulton’s lead vocal sounds like a Paul 
McCartney record playing during a small 
earthquake. The tight background vocals 
resemble Queen in their prettier moments. 
The middle of the song features a heavenly 
interlude of “aah’s” which utilizes a com­
plex tape reversal technique to achieve its 
beautiful sound.
Sunburst Finish begins with heavy metal 
strokes very reminescent of Led Zepplin’s 
earlier stuff. Even the voices are masked 
with electronic filtering. The lyrics com­
bine antrhopological talk with street jar­
gon: “Foxy pharaoh knows all, won’t tell/ 
Dangerous knowledge locked in a cell/ Eve
of the sphinx now winks at you/ What is he 
thinking? Wish that I knew.” Portions of 
the tune resemble Yes’ Relayer in instru­
mentation and in verse, pairing frenzied 
guitar passages with equally frenzied chor­
uses. Powell and Rundgren take turns with 
their respective synthesizer and guitar play­
ing. Then the Yes-like strains are alternated 
with slower, smoother instrumental and vo­
cal lines strung together with guitar psyche 
delia.
In three albums, Utopia has established 
a general musical style of raucousness and 
of dependence upon the screamings and 
gurglings of various synthesizer instru­
ments. The first side of Ra exemplifies the 
proper use of this style. Hiroshima and 
Singring and the Glass Guitar display what 
can happen when the style is allowed to 
dominate the music. Ra demonstrates 
Utopia fares best with music about mysti­
cism and emotion and should avoid fairy­
tales and social commentary.
SEA LEVEL'S EXCITING DEBUT
by David Doremus
Sea Level, a new album by a new band, 
big deal, right? But... three-fourths of Sea 
Level just happen to be one half of the 
Allman Bros. Chuck Leavell on keyboards, 
Lamar Williams on bass, and Jai Johany 
Johanson on drums and percussion all paid 
their dues with the infamous Brothers be­
fore that band dissolved in a mixture of 
Cher, cocaine, infighting and musical stag­
nation. The three began jamming backstage 
before the break-up. After that, they set­
tled down for some serious work. The addi­
tion of Leavell’s old friend Jimmy Nalls on 
guitar filled out the group. A few months 
of rehearsal and road work later they 
emerged with one of the most exciting 
debut albums of the last five years.
Sea Level manages to cover a surprising­
ly wide musical spectrum, ranging from 
good old southern rock and roll to heavily 
jazz-influenced instrumental jams. It’s all 
good and it’s all exciting, characterized 
by a very tight, clean sound that makes 
it hard to resist the inevitable comparisons, 
with the Allman Bros. " There are some 
similarities but Sea Level is definitely their 
own band, leading in directions previously 
untapped by Dixie rockers. They are ori­
ented more towards instrumentals than 
vocals and incorporate an astounding 
variety of musical styles within a distinc­
tive band sound. They have all the energy, 
and excitement that made the Allman 
famous, a funky feeling reminiscent of 
Little. Feat, some fine jazzy tunes and 
nore of the mindless guitar pounding that 
las characterized so many recent southern
rock bands.
Only 3 out of 8 tunes are vocals, all 
rockers complete with horn section. 
Country Fool and Shake a Leg are up­
tempo tunes, designed to get feet 
tapping. Jimmy Nalls lays down some fine 
slide work on Country Fool which Chuck 
Leavell boogies out barrelhouse style. 
Shake a Leg uses the horns to excellent 
advantage and Leavell’s over dubbed organ 
complements his rocking piano perfectly. 
Nothing Matters but the Fever slows 
things down a bit but without sacrificing 
any of the intensity of the first two. It’s 
a very bluesy number. The closest thing 
to Little Feat this side of the Mississippi. 
Leavell’s vocals are capable but not as­
tounding, but his piano solo is very nice 
here, trading off licks with Nalls. The 
guitar breaks do sound a bit like Duane 
Allman but Jimmy Nalls has enough chops 
of his own to separate him from other 
guitarists and give him a distinctively 
personal style.
The remaining five songs are all varying 
blends of jazz and rock. Tidal Wave is pro­
bably the closest to a jazz tune, a very 
tasteful, laid back jam. Johanson shows his 
stuff here on percussion and Williams gets 
a chance to prove how his impeccable 
timing and melodic sense make him a 
vital part of anything the band does. He 
doesn’t solo but he keeps everything 
together. Nalls and Leavell, as usual, are 
the lead men. Nalls’ guitar work is a fas­
cinating blend of rock phrases and jazz 
idiom and Leavell digs back to his roots for 
some very bluesy piano.
Scarborough Fair is a surprising version
of the Paul Simon tune. Completely instru­
mental, it begins and ends with a jazzy 
piano and bass vamp over which Leavell 
plays a slightly modified version of the 
well known melody. It’s a bit of a shock 
the first time you hear it but it has a 
definite tendency to become engraved on 
the minds of those who hear it. Chuck 
Leavell’s blues slides and runs and his 
arpeggio fills between phrases adding a new 
dimension to a perhaps overly familiar 
tune. Nalls lets loose a guitar solo that is 
completely his own, containing no similari­
ties to Duane Allman or Dicky Betts as 
there are on the other songs. Chuck Lea- 
vell’s solo has a few cliches, but thev are
easily forgiven because he uses them so 
well.
Just a Good Feeling is the weakest 
cut on the album, possibly because Leavell 
tries a bit of synthesizer and doesn’t pull it 
off too well. They just don’t seem to get 
as involved in this tune as they do in the 
others. Musically it’s good, but it doesn’t 
have any fire to it. One can’t help feeling 
that they are just going through the 
motions.
Overall it’s an excellent album, especi­
ally as it is Sea Level’s first. They are ex­
tremely versatile, all excellent musicians 
and, as Leavell says, they are playing “for 
pleasure and the sake of music rather than 
to make money.” They’re definitely going 
places and with an attitude like that you
PAPA lOHN'S COMING
by David Schatz
Papa John Creach, who has been playing 
fiddle for decades, will be playing at Car- 
negie-Mellon on Friday, March 18 at 8:00 
pm and 10:30 pm in the Skibo Ballroom.
Born in Beaver Falls, Papa John moved 
west to Chicago in the 30’s and to Californ­
ia in 1945. Various groups were along the 
way, including The Johnny Creach Trio. 
Then ten years ago, he met Joey Coving­
ton, Papa John’s friendship with the young 
drummer brought him into the Jefferson 
Airplane in 1970, soon after Covington 
had joined.
Described as ‘'an extra-ordinary blues 
violinist, who brought a touch of funk to 
the band,” Papa John later played with 
Hot Tuna and most recently Jefferson 
Starship.
With Papa John will be Larry Coryell,
who as an early part of the progressive 
“rock-jazz” movement, has been described 
as “out of a jazz-Hendrix bag that alternat­
ed between tasteful melodic statements, 
amplifier tricks, and some of the fastest 
four-finger runs ever heard.” It was first 
with his own group The Free Spirits that 
Coryell began to develop his reputation. 
Since then he has played with such artists 
as Jack Bruce, Herbie Mann, Chick Corea, 
and John McLaughlink and in 1973 formed 
The Eleventh House.
Coryell’s latest album, The Lion and 
The Ram will be given away on WRCT 
Tuesday, March 15th through Thursday, 
March 17th

chairman of the Activities Board’s Concert 
Committee.

ROUNDBALLERS SET SEASON RECORD
by Bob Firm
The winter of 1976-77 will long be re­
membered as the coldest ever in the city 
of Pittsburgh. However, in Oakland it will 
be remembered as the hottest basketball 
season in the history of Carnegie-Mellon. 
Coach Dave Maloney blended old and 
new faces into an unstoppable machine.
The 1976-77 edition of CMU was 
without a doubt the greatest in the school’s 
history as evidenced by their long list of 
accomplishments. The Tartan hoopsters 
brought the first Presidents’ Athlefic 
Conference title ever in any sport to the 
campus. They did it the hard way as they 
had to defeat Hiram twice to clinch the 
crown. The PAC championship also gave 
CMU a berth in the NCAA Division III 
playoffs.
Although the Tartans were defeated 
in both contests in their first appearance 
in the NCAA’s, it still can’t take away 
from their efforts. CMU set season records 
for wins (18), longest win streak (12), and 
best winning percentage (.750).
Coach Maloney said, “It was a fine and 
rewarding year. I think we gave the fans 
plenty of excitement.” For the second year 
head coach, it was rewarding in mere ways 
than one. He was named Small College 
Coach of the Year in the Pittsburgh area by 
Pittsburgh Basketball Writers for the se­
cond year in a row. The former All-Ameri­
can guard was voted Coach of the Year in 
the PAC.
The major reason for CMU’s court 
success can be traced to George Harvey. 
The All-American guard candidate did it 
all this season. He scored inside, outside, 
and in the clutch. He controlled the of­
fense and defense. Harvey’s talents were 
recognized by many as he raked in plenty 
of post-season honors.
The leading scorer on CMU’s squad with 
a 21.4 point average was named Small 
College Player of the Year by the Pitts­
burgh scribes and MVP in the PAC by the 
conference coaches. Harvey, who also led 
the Tartans in assists, was named to the
All-Tournament team at the Great Lakes 
Regional in the NCAA’s.
The junior college All-American who 
has an excellent chance of capturing the 
same honors in Division III broke school 
records. He set the mark for points in a 
season with 514 and the record for field 
goals with 206. Harvey scored a career 
high 38 points at home against John 
Carroll and 60 points at the NCAA play­
offs.
Another reason for the upswing in the 
Tartans’ basketball fortunes was the play 
of Harvey’s teammate from Allegheny 
Community College Les Harper. Harper 
was named to the All-PAC team for his 
outstanding play. ’’Leaping Les” was the 
leading rebounder for Tech with nearly 
nine a game.
Harper, who excelled in the pressure 
situations, averaged 13.2 PPG. His play 
in the overtime game versus John Carroll 
and during the stretch of others were 
instrumental in many CMU victories.
Co-captain Larry DiCicco was given 
Honorable Mention citation from the 
PAC coaches. He was a complete player 
at his guard position. The senior scored 
at a 13.6 clip, rebounded well, and 
played excellent defense.
Marty Costa started every game at 
center for the Tartans this season. After
the boards well in the big conference 
affairs.
Greg Chambers returned to the CMU 
program after taking a year off to concen­
trate on his studies. He was a pleasant 
addition. G.C. was superb late in the sea­
son when he had to pick up much of the 
slack caused by DiCicco’s ankle injury.
Paul Hamerly closed out his career at 
CMU as one of its best players ever. A 
broken foot early in the season sidelined 
the 6’9” star for much of the year. “The 
Franchise” came through in a big game 
at Thiel with five points and five rebounds 
in the final minutes of the contest as CMU 
came from behind.
Senior co-captain Ralph DeaBrunzzo 
provided excellent leadership off the 
bench. He handled the point guard duties 
and shot well in his playing efforts.
Pat Ward displayed his usual super 
attitude in both practices and games. He 
could always be counted on to provide a 
good defensive play.
Two freshmen, Mariano DeFilippo and 
Larry Hufnagel, saw plenty of action at 
Tech. They performed like seasoned 
veterans in many close affairs and should 
give CMU strength for years to come. _
The Tartans’ junior varsity team 
matched their senior counterparts with a 
fine 7-2 -record. The highlight of their
Pitt’s JV’s. They provide CMU with a solid 
nucleus for the future.
Coach Maloney felt that CMU had 
finally arrived at Hiram when Harvey’s 
shot at the final buzzer gave the Tartans 
the key victory and a two game lead in 
the PAC race. The turning point of the 
season, Maloney said, was the Steuben­
ville game. The Tartans had lost two in a 
row, but used a super second half to de­
feat an established scholarship school. 
The team then immediately followed with 
big pre-conference triumphs over power­
ful Westminster and Baldwin-Wallace.
Maloney wanted to thank all the 
followers of the Tartans. The student body 
proved that spirit was something to be 
proud of.
The program might have arrived this 
season, but good recruiting is needed to 
continue the success. Coach Maloney’s 
job should be a little easier this year 
because of the success that prevailed. The 
conference championship, trip to the 
NCAA playoffs, and the publicity provided 
by Sports Information Director Dennis 
Morabito are all strong selling points.
With three starters returning next season 
and several young performers that can step 
into the pressure roles. Coach Dave Malo­
ney could turn the Tartans into a basket­
ball powerhouse.

Swimmers Fifth at PAC Championships
by John Rossi
On March 3, 4 and 5 Camegie-Mellon’s 
Swimming Team traveled to John Carroll 
University for the 1977 Presidents’ Ath­
letic Conference Swimming and Diving 
Championships. The meet proved to be the 
high point of the Tartan Tankers’ season, 
after a somewhat disappointing dual meet 
schedule. CMU finished fifth out of the 
seven schools which sent teams, but 
scored 170.5 points, a 36.5 point improve­
ment over last year’s total score. In addi­
tion, the team set eight new school 
records, setting new standards in over half 
the meet’s Events.
The record setting performances began 
on the first evening of competition, as 
Harry Coleman set a new school mark in 
the 400 yard Individual Medley with a time 
of 4:43.71, good for sixth place. In the 
next event, the 800 yard Freestyle Relay, 
the team of Joe Dickey, co-captain Pete
o'
O'&
Dickey, Harry Coleman and Frank Ditt- 
man swam to fourth place in a school 
record 7:43.63. On the second day of 
events, Joe Dickey set a new school re­
cord in the 200 yard Individual Medley, 
with a time of 2:06.75, over one full 
second below the existing record. In the 
200 yard Freestyle, Frank Dittman shat­
tered the school mark by over four se­
conds, finishing fifth in 1:52.86. Harry 
Coleman sprinted to his third record of 
the meet in the 100 yard Backstroke, 
Finishing fourth in 58:53. On the final day 
of competition, Frank Dittman stroked 
past the school record in the 100 yard 
Freestyle with a time of 51.22, good 
enough for tenth place in a strong field. 
Harry Coleman set his fourth record and 
registered the team’s highest Finish, placing 
second in the 100 yard Butterfly, in a time 
of 54:57, just one tenth of a second away 
from the championship. In the final event 
of the meet, Harry Coleman contributed 
to his fifth record, Frank Dittman to his 
fourth, Joe Dickey to his third and Pete 
Dickey to his second, as the 400 yard Free­
style Relay finished fourth in a record 
3:26.07.
Excellent performances were not limi­
ted to the record setters, however. 
Throughout the meet the Tartan swimmers 
and divers had a string of season and life­
time best performances, a credit to the 
coaching job done by Donna Pecman and 
Mark McPherson. In the first event of the 
meet, the grueling 1.650 yard Freestyle, 
¦Tom Gerlowski stroked to twelfth place
in a personal best time of 19:48.01. Close 
behind was co-captain John Rossi, finishing 
14th in 19:48.55, also a personal best. In 
the 400 yard Individual Medley, in addi­
tion to Harry Coleman's record setting 
sixth place finish, Wilson Boyce finished 
twelfth with a time of 5:06.35, his 
personal best.
Beginning the second day of competi­
tion in the 500 yard Freestyle, Tom Ger­
lowski finished eleventh with a time of 
5:22.80. his personal best, only two se­
conds off the school record. John Rossi 
finished 15th in 5:40.37, Dave Bankert 
was 16th in 5:54.95, and Steve Liss was 
17th in 6:02.75, all personal bests. In the 
200 yard Individual Medley, besides Joe 
Dickey’s record setting third place swim, 
three other swimmers had personal bests; 
Wilson Boyce finished tenth in 2:14.775, 
Dave Watterson Finished twelfth in 2:18.48 
and Bob Gierard finished 14th in 2:24.48. 
In the 50 yard Freestyle, Frank Dittman 
sprinted to ninth place in 23:55. and Pete 
Dickey to 15th in 24:32. In the tough 
200 yard Butterfly, Neal Kusfrner and 
Steve Liss swam their personal best times 
of 3:05.20 and 3:13.00 to finish 14th and 
15th, respectively. In the 200 yard Free­
style, Frank Dittman fnished fifth in a 
school record 1:52.86. He was joined by 
Tom Gerlowski, 2:01.62; Dave Bankert, 
2:03.97; and John Rossi, 2:05.78, finishing 
18th, 19th, and 21st. In the 100 yard 
Breaststroke, Jamie Uber and Bob Gierard 
turned in their best times of the season.

ICERS ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFFS
by Bill Oakley
The CMU Tartans battled Penn State 
McKeesport Saturday in the Civic Arena in 
a Western Pennsylvania Intercollegiate 
Hockey league game. The contest saw the 
Tartans spot PS-M an early 4-0 lead and 
then battle back to within one goal, only 
to have time run out.
The first period of the game was close 
checking, with both teams playing cau­
tiously. The only goal of the period be­
longed to Penn State. Rick Spott passed 
from behind the goal to Bob Fleming, 
who drilled the short shot past CMU 
goalie Don Crisafulli. The Tartans held 
an 8-7 edge in shots on goal for the period.
The second stanza of play saw five goals 
scored, as both teams opened up the play. 
Penn State scored the first three goals of 
the period to increase their lead to 4-0. 
Bob Schuster scored on a 35 footer that 
eluded goalie Don Crisafulli. Bob Fleming 
picked up his second of the game on a 
sharp angle shot, and Bob Penzilik scored 
on a shot which caromed in off at Crisa- 
fulli’s pads. CMU finally got their offense 
in gear with 1:05 left in the period. Ken 
Trumpfeller took a pass from Jack Arturo, 
split the PS-M defense and faked goalie 
Jim Pollack to the ice to score the Tartans 
first goal of the game. Thirty five seconds 
later Joe Chaves scored from in front to 
cut PS-M’s lead to 4-2. Jeff Reh and Bill 
Thompson picked up the assists. Penn 
State held an edge in shots for the period,
Bob Schuster bagged his second of the 
game to stretch PS-M’s lead to 5-2. The 
Tartans did not give up, and they came 
right back with two goals of their own. 
Bill Oakley passed to Jack Arturo, who 
passed to Tom Grimm in front of the net. 
Grimm didn’t waste any time in drilling
Tankers
1:11.48 and 1:12.98, to finish 15th and 
19th. The 100 yard Backstroke was a 
strong event for the Tartans. Besides Harry 
Coleman’s record 58.53 fourth place 
finish, Joe Dickey took fifth place with a 
time of 59.39, Dave Watterson finished 
twelfth in 1:01.74, and Pete Dickey fin­
ished 18th in 1:05.40. The 400 yard Med­
ley Relay team of Joe Dickey, Jamie Uber, 
Harry Coleman, and Frank Dittman fin­
ished sixth with a fine timé of 3:55.45.
The final day of the meet began with 
Frank Dittman’s record 51:22 tenth place 
finish in the 100 yard Freestyle. Joining 
him were Pete Dickey, 15th, 53.49 and 
Dave Benkert, 19th, 54.73. The 200 yard 
Backstroke was another strong event for 
CMU as Joe Dickey placed third in 2:08.41 
and Dave Watterson placed seventh in 
2:12.44, his personal best time by six 
seconds. In the 200 yard Breaststroke, 
Jamie Uber and Bob Gierard both turned 
in season best times, finishing 15th and 
16th at 2:36.76 and 2:37.93, respectively. 
Joining Harry Coleman as he swam to
the shot past PS-M goalie Pollack. Ken 
Trumpfeller and Bill Oakley then teamed 
up for CMU’s fourth goal. Oakley passed 
to Trumpfeller, took a return pass and 
then fed Trumpfeller in front for the shot.

Steve Liss, finishing 14th (59.04), 16th 
(1:09.15) and 17th (1:11.64), each in a 
personal best time. In the 400 yard Free­
style Relay, the team of Dickey, Dickey, 
Coleman and Dittman finished fourth in a 
secool record 3:26.07. In the one meter 
diving competition, CMU delivered a much 
stronger performance than last year as Tony 
Carrington, Brian Kay and Bob Frye, under 
the guidance of Mark McPherson, finished 
ninth, tenth and eleventh, in competition 
which saw eighth through twelfth places 
decided by less than ten points. Three 
members of the team were not present at 
the meet, including breaststroker Gene 
Monaco, out with a shoulder injury, free- 
styler Karen Payton, out with a leg injury, 
and freestyler Dierdre Mullen.
The final team standings in the meet 
saw Allegheny far out in front, followed in 
order by John Carroll, Washington & Jeff­
erson, Hiram, Carnegie-Mellon, Bethany 
and Case Western Reserve. The Tartans 
were only IVi points behind fourth place
assist. The Tartans tried to knot the 
score, but time ran out with Penn State- 
McKeesport holding a 5-4 lead.
The Tartans record is now 3-5-1, and 
they are all but eliminated from the 
playoffs. There is one game remaining

Hiram. The team rebounded well from a 
dual meet season filled with bad luck, in­
juries and unexpected defeats. Each team 
member contributed towards the team’s 
performance at the PAC meet.
The team can look forward to a good 
coming year, with the continued improve­
ment of present team members and help 
from freshman recruits. The team is losing 
only two seniors, freestylers Frank Dittman 
and Karen Payton, whose contributions 
will be missed. In voting held after the 
meet, Frank Dittman was elected Most 
Valuable Swimmer for 1976-77, and John 
Rossi and Harry Coleman were elected 
co-captains for 1977-78.
The team would like to express their 
deepest appreciation for the efforts on 
behalf of the team made by Coach Donna 
Pecman and Diving Coach Mark McPher­
son. Without the them, the team could not 
possibly have done as well as it did. Credit 
is also due to the members of the team, 
who have been practicing since Novem­
ber 1, and who stuck it out when it might 
have been easier not to.
The Tartans started quickly in the third 
period, trying to find the equalizers. It was 
Penn State, however, who drew first hlood.
IM WRIGHT 
AND WRONG
by l.M. Wright
This is a random collection of sports 
odds and ends. -
Here is a lesson in Athletic Department 
math. In an economy move earlier this 
semester, a janitor from the Gym was “let 
go” and not replaced. When the Gym 
started looking dirty, three men were 
brought over from the other maintenance 
crews on campus for four days at four 
hours per day to clean the Gym. There 
men put in their eight hours at the other 
locations and then put in four hours of 
overtime at the Gym. All of the above 
factors combine to make 72 hours of pay 
for the extra men for that week. (3 men X 
4 days X 4 hours/day X \Vt for the time 
and a half for overtime). Since the usual 
work week is 40 hours and the three men 
are probably making pay comparable to 
the man that was “let go”, then the Ath­
letic Department paid for 32 extra hours 
of work. To SAVE MONEY, the Athletic 
Department paid for 72 hours at approxi­
mately $4.00 /hour instead of 40 hours 
or a net loss of approximately $128.00. 
That is some great way to save money.
The janitor on the night shift that 
was “let go” is desperately needed to help 
take care of the building. The crew at the 
Gym is definitely understaffed without the 
night shift janitor. The night shift is the 
best time to get anything done at the Gym 
since the varsity and intramural programs 
run almost until midnight and now there 
is no one to take care of the buiding until 
the morning shift. When the morning shift 
arrives, so does the crowd of people to use 
the facilities. Also, a janitor in the building 
during the late night hours acts as a deter­
rent to crime. As it is now, there is no one 
in the building between 12 midnight and 8 
in the morning. There are so many ways

FROMARMCOONFINDING A JOB:
How hiring you can cost somebody $42,168
Whatever America s unemployment 
rate, 89,000,000 of us now hold jobs. 
That won't mean much when you look 
for a job, yourself. You'll have tough 
competition. You're among 18,000,000 
more Americans looking for work over 
the next ten years. That's how many 
new jobs America must create, includ­
ing yours.
It’s going to cost a lot of money. 
Before you get a dime of salary, who­
ever hires you will have to buy tools, 
office space, factory equipment and 
buildings—the things it takes to let you 
do your job. The average cost to com­
panies is now $42,168 for each job.
We don't mean you can't be hired 
until your employer finds exactly 
$42,168. You might walk into an existing 
job. But don't count on it. Not with 
18,000,000 competitors. Some compa­
nies can hire you for less than $42,168. 
But others—heavy industry, for 
instance—need much more. At Armco, 
our cost is now $55,600 a job.
That money must come from 
whatever a company has left over after 
expenses. In other words, from profits. 
A company might borrow against fu­
ture profits to make you a job. But 
still, profits pay for jobs because that's 
the only source companies have.
If you asked your friends how 
much the average U.S. company clears 
in profits on each dollar of sales, 
chances are many of them would guess 
25C or more. The truth is 5C or less. 
That’s not much to put to work to 
make new jobs.
FREE-Armco’s plain talk on how to get a job
We've got a free booklet to help you 
get a job. Use it to set yourself apart, 
above the crowd. We answer 50 key 
questions you'll need to know. Like why 
you should bone up on companies you 
like. What to do after the first inter­
view. Hints to make you a more aggres­
sive, attractive job candidate. All 
prepared for Armco by a consulting 
firm specializing in business recruiting, 
with help from the placement staff of 
a leading university.

Plain talk about PROFITS
Over our company’s 77-year history, 
Armco has averaged 5C profit on each 
dollar of sales. We pay out part of our 
earnings immediately in dividends to 
Armco's 100,000 shareholders. So out 
of each nickel, we have perhaps 3C 
left to invest in new jobs.
Building $55,600 jobs—3C at a 
time—is tough. At this rate, we must 
sell another $1,850,000 worth of 
products and services to clear enough 
money for a single new job. That’s 
why better profits are important. They 
make more jobs. Even Government 
jobs. The Government's money comes 
from taxes on all of us who work.
Next time some know-it-all sneers 
at “money-grubbing business',' ask him 
what he'd do without it. He's sneering 
at his own job chances, and yours.
Armco wants your plain talk about profits and jobs
Does our message make sense? We'd 
like to know what you think. Your 
personal experiences. Facts to prove 
or disprove our point. Drop us a line. 
We'll send you back a more detailed 
report on profits and jobs. Our offer of 
How to Get a Job, above, tells you how 
to write us. Let us hear from you. We've 
all got a stake in more American jobs.

into the building that even someone in the 
building cannot stop someone from getting 
in, but it might scare someone out of the 
building who thought it was empty.
And speaking of letting someone go, 
how about the “releasing” of Miss Fisk 
from basketball coaching duties after 
nearly 22 years with the team and 20 
consecutive years of winning seasons 
that was broken this year. The “team” 
was not even considered a varsity team un­
til 3 years ago. At that time, Miss Fisk 
was running seven sports teams that were 
competing like varsity teams with varsity 
expenditures, like away trips and meals and 
the referees for home games, all on an 
intramural budget. Then, the Athletic 
Department came through with some more 
money and the teams suddenly became 
“varsity” teams. Nothing else had really 
changed except the title of the account 
that the money was coming out of. Seven 
“varsity” teams and intramurals all running 
off an intramural budget was impossible. 
There had to be an additional source of 
money for all those activities and the most 
probably source was Miss Fisk. And now, 
she has been “relieved” of her coaching 
duties of the basketball team to concen­
trate on coaching the fencing team. The 
fencing team will benefit, but without Miss 
Fisk there would not be so many estab­
lished sports teams for women.
Since the women did not get “varsity” 
money to run the sports teams until 3 
years ago, women who have lettered for 
four years do not receive the same award 
as the men who have lettered for four 
years, since the women’s teams were con­
sidered to be intramural all star teams 
competing against the varsity teams of the 
other schools. There are several women 
that deserve to be considered for the 
fourth year award this year, and even some 
that have already graduated. The women 
that played for four years receive a hearty 
handshake from the Athletic Department 
instead of a gold watch like the men re­
ceive.

how it s easier/ to ace the coursesyou
It finally comes down to commitment.
When you don’t like a course, it’s hard to excel. The class gets 
tedious. The texts get boring. The lectures get dreadful. Your work 
suffers. And so do your grades.
Compare that with the courses you really believe in.
You care more. You try more. And without even noticing, you just 
naturally do better.
It’s true in school. It’s true outside of school.
For example, we believe there’s just one way to brew 
Busch beer. The natural way. With natural ingredients.
Natural carbonation. Natural ageing.
We believe that’s the best way to brew a beer.
And when you believe in what you’re 
doing, you just naturally do it better.
Taste a Busch and we think you’ll agree.
