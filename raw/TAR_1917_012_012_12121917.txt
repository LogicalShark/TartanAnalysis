DIRECTOR TALKS TO ASSEMBLY ABOUT ENGINEERS AND TOE DRAFT
War Department Grants Vir­
tual Exemption—School 
May Adopt Twelve 
Months Course
DRILL IS HELD UP
The general assembly in the Music 
Hall at 11:30 today was called to give 
Director Hamerschlag an opportunity 
to talk to the students ahout their new 
status under the draft, the plan for 
concentrated work all he year round 
and other subjects connected with the 
•war.
On Sunday there was published in 
*he Pittsburgh papers an Associated 
Press dispatch dated in 'Washington, 
Dec. 8, stating that engineering stu­
dents in schools recognized by the 
War Department had virtually been 
granted temporary exemption from 
the draft in the same manner as med­
ical students. The full text of the 
dispatch is given under official notices. 
There was considerable doubt as to 
the meaning of the phrase, “recogniz­
ed by the War Department,” so the 
schpol authorities immediately tele­
graphed to Washington concerning it. 
Replies so far received indicate that 
the ruling certainly does apply to C.
I. T.The plan for concentrated work here 
at Tech was put before the student 
body. It had prev'^usly been outlined 
by several members of the faculty to 
their Senior classes somewhat as fol­
lows: Examinations, inspection visits, 
all recesses and vacations will be 
propped, and school work continued 
steadily so that present Seniors will 
graduate in April and present Juniors 
about next December. The plan then 
seemed to meet with considerable ap­
proval. It has been adopted at Bos­
ton Tech, Stevens Institute of Tech­
nology, and several other places.
Plans for military drill are still wait­
ing for word from Canada in regard 
to the appointment of an officer. If 
the War Department should finally 
designate Tech as a Reserve Officers’ 
School, the officer will be unnecessary; 
hut if the government’s action is un­
favorable this temporary arrangement 
will be made permanent.
SCIENTISTS TO HOLD CONVENTION HERE
Meetings Begin December 28. 
Tech Faculty Interested
The American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, with its sev­
eral affiliated scientific societies, will 
hold Its seventieth meeting in Pitts­
burgh from December 28 to January 2. 
Dr. Charles Richard Van Hise, presi­
dent of the University of Wisconsin, 
•will deliver the address o£ the retir­
ing president at the opening general 
session in Carnegie Music Hall Friday 
•evening, December 28. “The Economic 
Effects of the World War in the'Unit­
ed States” is his subject. A reception 
in the foyer, tendered by the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh and the Carnegie 
Institute, will follow.
At each meeting of the association 
two or three lectures complimentary 
to the association are delivered by lo­
cal scientists. Dr. Frank Schlesinger, 
director of Allegheny Observatory, has 
been selected to deliver the first of 
these this year at the Schenley High 
School Saturday night, December 29.
. Several Pittsburgh committees have 
"been appointed to arrange for the 
meetings, as follows:
Executive—Dr. W. J. Holland, chair­
man; Dr. S. B. Linhart, secretary; W.

RED CROSS COMMITTEE OPENS DRIVE TODAY
Class Presidents in Charge of 
Campaign
-Staff- 
Levin 
McNamara 
Avery 
Meinhold
In an attempt to increase its mem­
bership to fifteen million, the Amer­
ican National Red Cross will start 
on December 16 and end on December 
24,1917, a nation wide campaign drive. 
The Carnegie Institute of Technology 
owing to the date of the Christmas re­
cess will begin enrolling members on 
Wednesday, December 12 and the cam­
paign will end on Monday, December 
17. Annual membership of one dol­
lar will be solicited.
Our aim is to secure the enrollment 
of every day and night student to help 
Allegheny County bring its member­
ship up to the required 350,000 mem­
bers.
The admirable work of the Amer­
ican Red Cross during the present war 
as well as the prompt, efficient, un­
questioning services and help which 
it constantly^ extends to unfortunate 
groups, irrespective of nationality, 
creed or color, is too well known to 
need further comment in these col­
umns. The report of the society was 
published in brief in last week’s Tar­
tan.
To be a member means a willing­
ness to help suffering humanity.
Help by enrolling; see your class

UNUSUAL AMUSEMENTS AT M. M. GUILD BAZAAR
Booths Open at 4:30, But 
Dancing Does Not Begin 
Till 8:00
The primary purpose of the Guild 
Christmas party or Allied Bazaar is 
not to make money, as is usually the 
case at bazaars, but to afford a social 
event at which every student of Tech 
with all his or her friends may have 
a general good time. There are few 
such events at Tech. Teas, dances, 
and smokers seem to be about the 
only “get-together” affairs in vogue. 
The Guild Bazaar will afford amuse­
ment for everyone. There will be folk 
dances of the allied nations, and 
booths representing the allied nations. 
For those who enjoy dancing, Carnegie 
Union boasts of a fine floor. The 
charge as you see in the notice above, 
is nominal, and what money is cleared 
will go to Dr. Blair to help in the 
Civilian Relief work.
The booths will open at 4:30 in 
the afternoon, but the dances will not 
begin before 8:00. No charge will 
be asked in the afternoon. Bring 
your friends and help them have a 
good time on Monday, December 17.

score at the close of the schedule 
runs. This cup will be in the posses­
sion of the winner for the entire year. 
Permanent possession of the cup will 
result from one man winning it twice. 
The races will not be very long and 
everyone will receive a handicap. Pre­
vious experiences or training is not 
necessary, however, practice runs 
through the park will be of material 
advantage.
The installation of the Delta Up- 
silon Fraternity at Tech will take 
place on Saturday of this week. The 
installation proper will bo hold in the 
morning at the old Bellefield Club, and 
luncheon will be at the same place. 
Sometime during the morning the ser­
vice flag of the local chapter, con­
taining thirty-one stars, will be raised. 
The thirty-one members in service 
comprise about a fourth of the total 
membership of the fraternity. At the 
same time the names of these men 
will be placed upon an honor roll.
All the members of the Delta Up- 
silon executive council are expected 
to be present, besides Mr. John Pat­
terson, President of the Fraternity, 
who is to officiate. They are Dean C. 
Mathews, Herbert I. Markham, John 
P. Broomell, Herbert W. Congdon, 
Harry A. Hey, Joseph Banigan, Thom­
as F. Black, Jr., Almond C. Brockway 
and Vernon Packard.
In the afternoon the Drama De­
partment, under Professor Stevens, 
will present the play, “Sweethearts.” 
This, however, is open, for no tickets 
are required and all students are wel­
come. Following there will be a re­
ception at the Sigma Tau house. The 
list of patronesses for that affair is as 
follows: Mrs. Patterson, Mrs. Eaton,
Mrs. Schaeffer, Mrs. Schreiner, Mrs.

Mrs. Newmyer, Mrs. Goettmann, Mrs. 
Warner, Mrs. Holiday, Mrs. Waite and 
Miss Goettmann,
The committee in chargo of the 
Delta Upsilon installation consists of 
Mr. Yoder, Mr. Schreiner, Mr. Leete, 
Mr. Aude, and Mr. Rundle from the 
local Delta U. Alumni Association, 
and Ilaushalter, Close, Powell, Todd, 
and Muller from Sigma Tau.
INDUSTRY PLEBES PLAN AN ELABORATE DANCE
Committee Announces That 
McCoys Will Give 
Exhibition Dance
The date of the dance to be given 
by the Plebes of the School of Applied 
Industries to the Middle and Upper 
men has been changed from Friday, 
Dec. 14 to Thursday, Dec. 13, one day 
earlier. The place is the same, the 
Union.
This dance is an annual affair and 
always has in the past given the 
Plebes a chance to show what they 
can do. According to advance infor­
mation this years’-affair will certainly 
not fall behind the standard set in 
the past.
The Plebe committee has completed 
the arrangements. It promises to be 
the one dance of the season.
The McCoys of the Palace which is 
run in connection with Duquesne Gar­
den have been secured to give an ex­
hibition dance. This winter they are 
giving a series of supper dances at 
the Chatham Hotel.
Sweeny’s Orchestra has been engag­
ed to play for the occasion and they 
promise to make the music snappy.

MISSIONARY TO BRAZIL AT INDUSTRY ASSEMBLY
Captain Hamilton of Aviation 
Recruiting Station 
Also Spoke
The Industries Assembly had an ex­
ceptional program for its mooting at 
12:30 last Wodnesday.
Captain Hamilton, of the local Avia­
tion Recruiting Station for Officers, 
gave a short, but interesting and in­
structive talk, clearing up many points 
which formerly have been hazy.
Professor Tjiomas Porter, mission­
ary of the Presbyterian Church, in 
Brazil, then spoke. Dr. Porter is an 
American, but has lived in Brazil 
many years and so is very familiar 
with the Brazilian people and their 
customs. Dr. Porter emphasized the 
fact, that Brazil and the United States 
do not entirely understand each other, 
but that each has faith in the other. 
All noted Americans that have gone 
to Brazil have created a good impres­
sion. Dr. Porter believes that Brazil 
is destined to become one of the two 
great countries of North and South 
America that will eventually become 
dominant in this hemisphere. Brazil’s 
mistakes are only those of a young re­
public, but Dr. Porter declares that 
few mistakes have been made. By fol­
lowing the United States in principles 
of government, Brazil has become sec­
ond only to the United States in dem­
ocracy.
Friday evening, true to its name and 
purpose, Carnegie Union was the 
scene of the First Annual Handshake, 
a welcome to the entering class of 
of the Night Science School. It seem­
ed fitting that the members of the first 
cilass to hold an affair at the Union 
should be the ones to put it to such a 
purpose. Prompted by a double mo­
tive, the Klan decided upon this affair. 
First it wanted to arouse an interest 
in the school and its activities among 
the first year men. Further, the neces­
sity of technically trained men is well 
understood by the men of the Klan 
and they realized that some steps must 
be taken to increase the percentage 
of men who complete the courses at 
Night Science.
This work is necessary among the 
first year men, for, according to pre­
vious years only about fifty per cent 
of the class returns after the first 
semester. To accomplish this double 
purpose the Klan decided to inaugu­
rate the annual hand-shake.
George Morgan presided and in be­
half of the Klan ho welcomed the en­
tering class into the Night Science 
School. After the welcome, a musical 
solection was rendered by Klepman 
and Simmons of the fifth and second 
years, respectively. Director, Hamer 
schlag, then addrossed the meeting, 
giving an interesting talk on the part 
American brains and energy had in 
helping France and England at the be 
ginning of the war. It was the first 
opportunity for a meeting between tho 
Diroclor and tho new men and they 
quite enjoyed his talk. “Doar Old 
Tech," was then sung with a hearty 
spirit. Doan Mott then spoke ahout 
tho why of tho wonderful Tech spirit. 
Ho fully expressed it when ho said 
tho kernel of tho Tech spirit lay In 
our motto: "My Heart Is in tho Work
D. W. Allan tho operatic bass of Night 
Scionco followod wlfh a solo: “Kooji 
tho Home Firos Burning.” As usual, 
his singing was well appreciated.
Gordon E. Wright, tho organizer of 
the Ivlannlcht was then Introduced as 
ono of the most active mon In Night 
Science affairs In spite of tho fact that 
his schedule for tho past flvo years 
has been the heaviest carried by a 
Night Science man. Wrlghf. talked of 
tho Nlto Scionco actlvltlos and tho 
nocosslty of tho first, year class gottlng 
Intorosted In them. Ho advised tho 
institution of an affair by each class, 
for tho Whole Night School, outsldo 
of Its own class affairs.
Tho following event was a boxing 
bout by Thornburg and Groomes of 
McKeesport who kept the crowd on its 
toes with their fast work. Tho final 
event of tho evening was that standard 
laugh producer, a plo eating contest, 
I-Iagel of the second year class literal­
ly and figuratively nosed his way to 
victory over the other contestants, 
Time 1:30 minutes. Hagel said he 
had eaten no pie since Thanksgiving. 
After he finished he thought it unlike­
ly that he’d be able to eat any till 
next Thanksgiving. Probably it will 
be his misfortune to be disqualified 
next time.
As a whole the hand-shake was a 
real success. Real Interest was arous­
ed among the new men and their ac­
tive participation in future school 
events seems certain.
TARTAN STAFF CHANGES
NELSON P. RICE H' R' Tl ru8 c- H- TODD
Manager Rice of The Tartan staff has applied for admission in the training school of the Aviation Corps, and 
has been accepted. Consequently, it becomes necessary to readjust the staff. H. R. Titus, Science Sophomore, 
has been appointed Business Manager for the remainder of the year, and C. H. Todd, Science Plebe, Advertising 
Manager.
MORE STARS ARE ADDED TO THE SERVICE FLAG
On the same day that Capt. Hamil­
ton, chief examiner of candidates for 
the Aviation Corps in Pittsburgh, 
spoke to the students of Science. 
“Scoops” Carey, who has earned his 
letter both In. basketball and football, 
took his examination for admission to 
that branch of the service. When 
Capt. Hamilton referred to a splendid 
physical specimen from Carnegie Tech 
that had applied to him for admission 
that morning, many in the' audience 
who knew of "Scoops’ ” action thought 
that he was referring to Carey. Per­
haps ho was. “Scoops” passed his 
examination successfully and thereby 
added another star to tho Tech service 
flag and another achievement to .his 
good record.
Before going to press It was learned 
that "Lofty” Abrams, who was recent­
ly elected basketball captain, and 
“Red” Beatty, president of tho $cI6nco 
Junior class and Tech tennis star, had 
also applied for admission to the Avia­
tion Corps. The latter has also passed 
his examination successfully and has 
been accepted.
C. K. Little, track manager for the 
coming season has left school and will 
| enlist in Signal Corps.
Preliminary Game Between 
Y. M. C. A and Camp 
Team
ABRAMS NOW CAPTAIN
Manager Pitts announces that 
Tech’s basketball game with Yale on 
New Year's Eve is now certain. The 
game is to be played at the East Lib­
erty Y. M. C. A., because their floor 
is the only one obtainable in the city 
which is large enough to accommodate 
tho crowd expected. It also has the 
additional advantage that the audi­
ence will see a preliminary game be­
tween the East Liberty Y. M. C. A. 
team and a team from one of the 
training camps—probably Camp Lee.
Every Tech man in town over vaca­
tion is expected to attend, and every 
man who can get back in time to see 
Tech’s game with the big eastern uni­
versity should do so. Admission will 
be fifty cents, or twenty-five with a 
student book. Those who attend will 
bo aiding both Tech and the men at 
Camp Lee.
"Lefty” Abrams was elected Captain 
of the Basket Ball team. “Lc' 
played a strong gamo at forward last 
season, his first on the varsity. He 
is elected to succeed Finlay, who is 
now at the U. S. Naval Academy.
Coach McCullough is gradually 
rounding the team into condition for 
tho season. Ho is experiencing con­
siderable difficulty in finding material 
to fill the shoes of those who luivo de­
parted to enter the national service. 
His troubles incurred in this manner 
have been incroasod by the enlist­
ment Into the Aviation Corps of Carey, 
who alternated with Grotzlor at cen­
ter last soafton. Levinson, who played 
end on tho football team and who has 
been out for tho team, has also filed 
bis application for this service.
The squad has been cut to twelvo 
mon and now includes Capt. Abrams, 
Grotzlor, Foxon, and Williams, of last 
year’s team. ICoofed, Kruse and Wlro 
aro back from last year's I‘lobo team, 
and Hoban, Oakley, Cosgrove, Doliorty 
and Levinson aro the uppor-classlnon 
out for tho varsity.
Tho Plobo squad has boon practicing 
as usual.
Manager Pitts has completed his 
schedule. All of tho gamos aro now

COLLEGE NIGHT MUSIC 
PLEASES STUDENTS
Dr. Atcheson and Dr. Kerr 
Speak at Shadyside 
Church
In spite of tho severe cold weather, 
those students of Carnegie Tech; Penn­
sylvania College for Women and tho 
University of Pittsburgh, who attend­
ed the College Night Service in the 
Shadyside Presbyterian Church, on 
Sunday evening, were indeed glad 
they had ventured out. The music 
was especially arranged for the even­
ing. In opening the service, represen­
tatives from the Tech Glee Club led 
the congregation in singing “The S*?r 
Spangled Banner.” Dr. Atcheson gave 
a few words of welcome to the stu­
dents, and of appreciation to Dr. Kerr 
for arranging this student service. 
The Glee Club of P. C. W. rendered 
“Our Glorious Land,” in a pleasing 
way. The Pitt Glee Club added their 
voices to the service also. Miss Mon­
ica Briggs and Miss Jean Wessner, 
from the Music Department, Design 
School, and Mr. Walter Wild, organist 
at Shadyside, gave a splendid instru­
mental trio, with cello, violin, and or­
gan. Dr. Kerr’s sermon, “The Bram­
ble King” was given forcefully and 
proved that true success is not attain­
ed through position but through real 
character.

CONCENTRATED WORK.
Now that the plan of working; twelve months in the year without 
recess is receiving serions consideration at Carnegie, the following 
article from “The Stu te,’’-of December 5, published by the Stevens 
Institute of Technology, is perhaps of interest:
“Since last Wednesday, the 25th, the Senior (-Ifiss lias been oper­
ating under a. new schedule. The plan was discussed by the class 
and the Senior Dean, Prof. Pryor, on Tuesday night arid put into 
effect on Wednesday morning.
“A week or so previously Prof. Pryor had told the class that by 
?rutting out vacations Commencement could be advanced I),y the space 
of two weeks. Two wcoks, however, seemed a short space of time to 
Have at the expense ol! all vacations and the idea did not meet with 
the entire approbation of the Seniors. They told the Professor that 
if a month could bo cut oft! the trouble would be worth while. In a 
short time the present plan was evolved. Professor Pryor and Pres­
ident Humphreys conferred with each other and with the Senior Class 
and the Faculty member,s who handle Senior subjects. It was de­
cided that no work in the course could be omitted or abridged, but 
that by adding an extra hour to each day and by working on Wed­
nesday and Saturday afternoons, a month could be saved by the first 
of the now year. II! the plan should be so far successful, an effort 
will be made to save another montji in the second term, finishing the 
course at the end ol! M$reh.n
A QUERY.
The following sugggestion, like several others of value which we 
have published this year, comes from the Margaret Morrison School: 
WHY IS A CATALOG?
We have all seen the C. 1. T. catalogue, and it’ there is any curi­
osity in our make-up we wonder why they are as they are. They are 
woefully behind the times, the one for the current year coming into j 
circulation in the spring, when the need for it is past. It belongs ; 
neither to the current year nor to the coming year, and offends the 
Hp-to-the-minute. attitude of the modern, active mind.
We don’t send Christmas cards on Fourth of July; we don’t buy 
strawberries in December; we don’t sharpen our skates in June. 
Why are we afflicted with a catalog as much out of season as any of 
these things? If we can’t have a catalog in season, why do we have 
il at all? Everything else out of season is extravagance. Is this any 
exception is the rule? With these questions in mind, we ask, in all 
earnestness, “Why is a catalog?”
AN APPRECIATION.
: Professor Keller, head of the Department of Mathematics in the
; Science School, has been granted leave of absence for several months 
: because of ill health. The Tartan takes this opportunity of express- 
ring the universal wish of good luck and the best of health for him. 
= Professor Keller, both last year and this, has been the virtual head 
: of military affairs at Tech, and no, doubt, is just as sorry to leave that 
work as the students are to see him go, even for a few months. He 
leaves with the assurance that the plans are going forward as steadily 
and soeedily as possible.
AN APOLOGY.
The Tartan wishes to apologize to. the members of the Design 
faculty who were caused extra trouble last week by The Tartan’s 
: unouneement that the play, “School for Scandal,” would be given 
i >ur times “this week,” when we shoud have said “next week.”
| The play really is open for students on Wednesday and Saturday 
= lits, December 12 and 15.

FACULTY MEMBERS WILL LECTURE ON WAR TOPICS
Lectures on a wide range ol’ war 
subjects from members of its faculty 
are to be made available during 1918, 
by the CarnegieJciistitute of Technolo­
gy for organizations in the Pittsburgh 
district. Lecturers will be sent out 
lo addross meetings when asked for.
The group of war lectures includes 
such topics as “How the Government 
Tosls the Soldier’s Brain,” "American 
Labor and the War,” “Food Conserva­
tion,” “Industrial and Social Changes 
to Women as a Result of the War,” 
“The Conquest ol’ the Air" and “Ger­
man Expansion Into the Americas.”
Lectures are also to be available on 
subjects related to science, travel, edu­
cation, art, literature, and on social 
and economic topics, many of which 
are illustrated. They are of a popular 
non-teclinical nature, and will aim both 
lo give useful information and to en­
tertain.
For these lectures no charge will 
be made other than a nominal booking 
fee. The institute is offering them as 
one of its fields of service to the com 
munity. They will be of interest to 
civic and philanthropic groups, wom­
en’s clubs* boards of trade, schools, 
community gatherings, and similar or­
ganizations.
At its first meeting of the year last 
week, the Chemical Club, of Science, 
elected the following officers:
President—Fair.
Vice President—Armor.
Secretary—Blau.
Treasurer—Paulus.
Soph. Representative—King.
The constitution of last year was re­
adopted and the chemists hope to en­
joy another successful year. Many 
interesting meetings are in view. At 
the next meeting, tomorrow' afternoon, 
they hope to have Mr. Crawford, who 
was a student here last year and is 
now in the government service, speak 
on “T. N. T.” and its manufacture.

NIGHT SCIENCE SMOKER TO BE AT SCHENLEY
The Annual Nite Science Smoker 
this year will be held at the Schenley 
Hotel, Saturday, Dec. 22, at 8 o’clock. 
An extensive program has been ar­
ranged and an interesting evening is 
expected. A little surprise is expect­
ed to be handed out to the night men 
this year. A good menu and some in­
teresting talks will help fill out the 
evening’s entertainment. All previous 
smokers have been dandles but this 
one is .expected to overtop them all.
This affair is looked forward to by 
the older men because of the chance 
to got together again in a social way 
and meet the other men. To the en­
tering classes it means an opportunity 
to moot the men in the upper classes 
and get acquainted with the general 
idoas and ideals of the Night Science 
School. This year, the new classes 
were welcomed into the school by the 
Klannlclit, with a smoker and enter­
tainment at the Union, and were given 
an idea of some of the school activi­
ties and purposes. The interest arous­
ed should insure an unusual attend­
ance of the first year men at the smok­
er, something that has previously been 
difficult to get. Many alumni are ex­
pected to attend this year.
The smoker is arranged by the third 
year class and the committee has also
POEM IS WELL RECEIVED AT SOPHOMORES’BANQUET
The following poem was read be­
fore the Science Sophomores during 
their very successful banquet Mon­
day night by Prof. Aude. It made quite 
a hit with the. Sophomores and they 
believe that it applies not only to 
every man in general but particularly 
to the students of the School of Ap­
plied Science.
“The man who wins is the average 
man,
Not built on anjr peculiar plan,
Not blest with any peculiar luck;
Just steady and earnest and full of 
pluck.
When asked a question, he does not 
“guessf'
He knows and answers “no” or “yes;” 
When set a task the rest can’t do,
He buckles down till he puts it thru. 
Three things he’s learned to do: that 
the man who tries;
Finds favor in his employer’s eyes; 
That it pays to know more than one 
thing well;
That it doesn’t pay all he knows to 
tell.
So he works and waits; till one fine 
day
There’s a better job with bigger pay. 
And the men who shirked wherever 
x they could,
Are bossed by the men whose work 
made good.
For the man who wins is the man 
who works,
Who neither trouble or labor shirks, 
Who-, uses his hands, his head,, his 
eyes;
The man who wins Is the man who 
tries.”

Another opportunity was given the 
Science students of obtaining infor­
mation regarding the different 
branches of military service, at the 
Wednesday .assembly last week, in 
Room 209, Science, when Captain 
Hamilton, president of the Aviation 
Recruiting Board in Pittsburgh, ad­
dressed the students on the Aviation 
Service, and Captain H. J. McCorkle, 
formerly assistant to the dean of the 
Science School, and last year chief of 
the Employment Bureau, told of his 
experiences at the Officers' Training 
Camps.
Captain Hamilton described with 
considerable detail the Aviation Serv­
ice, the requirements for a commis­
sion, and the work of the different 
branches. The different divisions are 
the Balloon Pilot, Observer and the 
Non-flier. The applicant for a commis­
sion must make known his choice, after 
which he is given a very rigid phy­
sical examination. He is then per­
sonally examined by the president of 
the board who, if the appicant is satis­
factory, recommends him for officers' 
training. This preliminary training 
continues for about eight weeks, after 
which he is sent to school for train­
ing in the branch in which he is to 
serve. If he in each case passes the 
requirements, he receives a commis­
sion, the rank in no case being lower 
than that of second lieutenant.
During this training he is paid at 
the rate of $100 a month, with a 60 
cent commutation each day for food. 
The student buys his own uniform.
The pilots’ or fliers’ work is chiefly 
that of piloting aeroplanes in battle. 
The requirements for the pilot are 
most rigid. The observer should or­
dinarily be over 25 years of age, in or­
der that his judgment be more mature.
The balloon-man’s work is all be­
hind the front lines, and consists in 
observing from an anchored balloon 
the movements of the enemy and in 
telephoning his information to the ar­
tillery. The non-fliers must be men 
of experience in organization and 
business life. Their chief require­
ment is extensive previous experi­
ence in purchasing, distribution, con­
struction, etc.
Captain Hamilton made clear sev­
eral points regarding the status of a 
draftee who wishes to enter this serv-1 
ice.
Captain McCorkle’s experiences 
were particularly interesting. He told 
of his work at Fort Oglethorpe and 
later at Fort Monroe. When the com­
missions were handed out, Mr. Mc­
Corkle received the rank of captain 
in the Coast Guard Service. He 
showed how, in many ways, this 
branch was purely a question of en­
gineering, an engineering education 
being absolutely pre-requisite.
Captain McCorkle expressed his sat­
isfaction at the re-instatement of mil­
itary training at Tech, saying that the 
training' which he received at Tech 
last spring has been invaluable to him.

quite interesting to a group of stu­
dents that gathered around him in the 
Science club room.
SOPHOMORE BANUUET 
PROVES GREAT SUCCESS
The Sophomore Class of the School 
of Applied Science held their annual 
banquet at the German club on Craft 
avenue on Monday evening, December 
10. The affair proved to be a-great 
success. In spite of the efforts of the 
Plebes to kidnap President Giffen, he 
was in his chair and opened the meet­
ing witli a few introductory remarks..
The guests included Dean Mott, 
Prof. How'er and Prof. Aude. After a 
satisfying meal was served, each of 
the above mentioned guests delivered 
a very good talk to the meeting. The 
Sophomores take delight in the fact 
that they were one of the first to know 
that Tech was recognized by the U.
S. government, as one of the leading 
engineering schools of the country 
thereby providing temporary exemp­
tion for the men of draft age. This 
was the principal feature of Dean 
Mott’s talk. They also think that they
we^e acting more wisely than the 
Plebes, who held their banquet on 
“Meatless Day.” Another novel fea­
ture was a short talk by a representa­
tive of each course being pursued by 
the Sophomore class.
Music was furnished by Plebes Leon­
ard and Hughes. The committee in 
charge was Herman, chairman; Aul 
and Stone.

FOR THE 
STUDENT
The college students of Tech were 
given special invitation to attend the 
war savings stamp meeting at Syria 
Temple last Sunday. Mr. Frank A. 
Vnnderlip, president of the National 
City Bank of New York, was the chief 
speaker.
At the Syria Mosque the invocation 
was delivered by Rev. Dr. Samuel 
Schulman, "The Star-Spangled Ban­
ner'* was sung with Mrs. Lillian Rus­
sell Moore leading, and a soldier hold­
ing Old Glory. Preceding the meeting 
music was furnished by Nirella’s band 
and a quartet.
When Mr. Vanderlip was escorted 
on the stage at the mosque and in­
troduced by James Francis Burke, 
Pittsburgh director of the stamp cam­
paign, he was given a hearty ovation. 
The address of Mr. Vanderlip was as 
follows:
“You have heard of our objectives in 
this great war our country is now en­
gaged in, .and you have applauded 
them. You have heard a picture drawn 
of what this conflict is to us. You 
must now understand your own per­
sonal responsibility in the war. Just 
what you must do to bring the boys 
home and to bring them home with 
their ranks full.
•*It is your personal responsibility 
to act and act yourself in a way that 
will help end the war. We look with | 
pleasure on a picture of victory, and 
no longer can it be said that our na­
tion is not awake to the fact that we 
are in the war. It is our duty to learn 
now what our part is in the struggle.
"Eight months ago you were all in 
accord with the declaration of war, 
and with the President, but you didn’t 
comprehend what it all meant. We' 
knew that we were a nation unpre­
pared, that our foes had been prepar­
ing for 40 years. We did not know 
what the cost would be.
"We were all shocked at the appro­
priation of live billion dollars. Next 
the country was asked to provide two 
billion dollars and soon it began to 
measure with the yardstick of the dol­
lar. The amount, soared tt> $19,000,- 
000,000 for the tlscal year, but we 
could hardly realize what that meant.
“Finally it began to come to us what 
we were to do, and men chafed under 
the slowness. We saw tho appro­
priation was not. winning the war, and 
that the treasury credits were not win­
ning the war. This is a war of equip­
ment and equipment is absolutely es­
sential to our victory.
“You will say that today the capacity 
of the workshops is greater. The 
Government wants $.15,000,000,000, and 
we will be further from it If wo keep 
on depending on the workshops for 
the things wo want and for the luxur­
ies. The Government must luivo the 
use of the workshops. We must not 
hinder the program of our country, 
and that is Just what wo are doing 
now. If you wanted a chauffeur and i 
saw a man driving a Rod Cross ambu- | 
lance you would not ask him to work , 
for you. That Is why we must curtail j 
our necessities and luxuries.
“All of us are interfering with the j 
Government’s task. Wo are tamper- i 
ing in a real, dlrocL way. Wo have no j 
right to compote with tho Government I 
to draw labor from it, nor has tho ¦ 
consumer the right to use tho raw 
materials. Business men will say ' 
their trade will be wrecked and that I 
they must llvo. Othors are dying on i 
the battlefield, why cannot tho bus!- , 
ness men die? I would rather have a j 
receiver than an executor any day.
“National stability means more to 
us than profits. Wages are high and 
we cannot expect these wage earners 
to suddenly turn to economy. The 
farmers have garnered a crop valued 
at $21,000,000,000. We will see a 
shocking business in luxuries. It is 
much better, however, for men t.o in­
vest in the war savings certificates 
today. The stamps are cheap, while 
luxuries are high. The stamps will 
advance in price and redemption value 
and the luxuries will decrease. Why 
not wait a while to buy the luxuries?
“Make it your personal duty to 
spread the news of this campaign, and 
by example and precept carry the mes­
sage as far as you can.”
Telegrams received up to Tuesday night indicated that Tech is 
included among the schools mentioned in (lie following Associated 
Press dispatch:
“Engineering students in schools recognized by (lie War De­
partment were granted virtual exemption from the selective draft 
aet today, under certain prescribed conditions. The action resulted 
from a conference between Secretary Baker, Provost Marshal Gen­
eral Crowder, and officials of engineering societies.
“The students are viewed as military assets of the future and 
are granted preferred classification, as are medical students in cer­
tain cases, so that they may complete their courses. They revert 
automatically to their former classification on graduation and may 
be called out immediately as enlisted men of the Engineer Reserve.
“A resolution adopted by the Society for the Promotion of En­
gineering and approved by the Council of the American Society of 
Engineers was presented at today's conference. It is pointed out 
(hat a majority of the 4,300 engineering students graduated during
1917 are already in the National service, and that one-third of the
1918 class has already enlisted.”

has been asked by Prof. Baker, of 
Harvard, to come every week to take 
his Saturday classes in play-writing. 
On account of some war work which 
Prof. Baker is doing, he is unable to 
meet with these classes and has 
chosen Dr. McLeod as his substitute. 
Anyone who knows Professor Baker’s 
reputation will realize the importance 
of this work. Dr. McLeod will prob­
ably make the weekly trip.

The fifth and seventh performances 
in Pittsburgh, of Prof. Thomas Wood 
Stevens' "Drawing of the Sword," and 
its prologue, speaks more eloquently 
of its success than any panegyric 
could possibly do.
These particular performances are 
selected because of the occasions upon 
which the production was presented; 
the fifth, given in Carnegie Music Hall 
on Carnegie Day; Nov. 25, 1917, as a 
tribute to Andrew Carnegie (Founder 
or the Carnegie Institute of Technolo­
gy) on his eighty-second birthday, be­
fore a crowded house of invited guests
needed only his presence to have 
added perfect satisfaction to all par­
ticipants. Miss Dorothy Rubenstein 
gave the "Prologue Before the Cur­
tain" at this performance.
The seventh performance was given 
in Syria Mosque Saturday evening, 
Dec. 8, for the benefit of the American 
Red Cross, to which organization all 
rights of production were surrendered 
by Mr. Stevens as his and Tech’s con­
tribution to the patriotic "urge" now 
animating every loyal citizen and in­
stitution in the United States. At this 
performance Miss Katherine Jones de­
livered the "Prologue Before the Cur­
tain,’’ while Miss Marguerite Bollinger 
acted as "Herald” for “The Drawing 
of the Sword" at both performances.
No efforts were spared, either by 
Mr. Tarbell and his committee, or by 
the various members of the faculty, 
whose services were enlisted, to make 
the pageant a success.
The principle roles were naturally 
in the hands of the Drama students; 
blit without the hearty co-operation of 
students from the Department of 
Architecture, Painting and Decoration 
and Music, the ensemble of two hun­
dred students necessary for the vari 
ous group pictures would have been 
impossible.
The costuming was brilliant and ef­
fective and the lighting well managed,
/rile Prologue afforded considerable 
room for action while the “Drawing of 
the Sword” presented opportunity for 
artistic groupings.
The Greek dancers met with hearty 
applause as also did Mr. William Mul­
ligan’s clever work as the “Jester 
Mr. Theo, Viehman’s “Tolstoi" was ex­
cellent. Mr. James Church made ad 
mlr’able use of his vocal powers a.c 
the “Priest,” while for startling and 
effective make-up Mr. Alex Buchanan’s 
"Tyrant” could not bo surpassed; his 
finger-nails alone wore a rare combi­
nation of science and art. Mr. Howard 
Smith's “Dante” was impressive. Mr 
Strawer served as I-Iernld for the 
French. Mr. Engle In similar capacity 
for the Italian group while Richard 
Mansfield 11 bore the English colors, 
Miss Eula Guy impersonated wounded 
and broken France.
Tho work of Miss McCampholl and 
2CAR Clovers, who alternated in the 
character "The Genius of Enlighten­
ment," was most satisfactory. They 
both have voices that carry woll and 
excellent diction adds much to tho d 
,1 ivory of their lines. In fact there 
was a noticeable improvement in dic­
tion throughout the entire cast.
The Prologue concluded with tho 
Triumph of War over the Festival of 
Enlightenment, a most tremendous and 
thrilling climax, when the God of bat­
tles springs into (he midst of the hap- 
py revellers and, attended by his sav­
age hordes, wreaks devastation every­
where.
Mr. George Trabert as “The Hun,” 
was terrible to behold and his half 
nude warriors, clad in the skins of 
beasts, with horned headdress, served 
to impress the beholder with the sav­
agery of war.
The original cast gave “The Draw­
ing of the Sword,” and their work has 
been so often commented upon in the 
daily press as to make it superfluous 
here, save to say the work of the prin­
ciples, “Truth,” (Miss Lucy Barton) ; 
“Liberty,” (Miss Anna Dice) ; and 
“Justice,” (Mr. James Church), was 
up to their usual high standard and 
most favorably received. “America,” 
last, but not least in interest, was en­
trusted to Violante Bollinger and 
brought forth a round of patriotic ap­
plause.
The music, under the direction of J. 
Vick O’Brien, was supplied by the or­
chestra of Department of Music. The 
performances were deservedly popu­
lar, reflecting credit on all concerned.
R, L. Kirk, George S. Deal, Science, 
*14, and Mr, Porter, instructor in elec­
trical engineering, have all been ac­
cepted as Lieutenants in the Navy, 
and expect soon to be on battleships 
in active service. The first two have 
been inspectors of engineering ma­
terials for the U. S. Navy at Cleve­
land. Kirk was just married last year. 
In school he was a track man, and a 
member of the band and glee club.

MIDDLE CLASS BANQUET HAS NOVEL FEATURES
The Middle Class of the Industries 
School held “that” banquet Tuesday, 
December 11, at 7:30 p. m. in the Sev­
enth Avenue Hotel.
The affair was a decided success 
which surpassed the expectations of 
even the committee which comprised 
J. W. Batman, J. A. Mayer, R. W. Sei­
del and IT. Adams.
The guests of honor were Dean Con- 
nelley, and Mr. Hartman.
Nearly thirty men enjoyed a bounti­
ful roast turkey dinner, which seemed 
to “hit. the spot.”
Toastmaster Batman handled his 
end of the program skillfully, intro­
ducing the principal speakers, Dean 
Connelley, Mr. Hartman, and Presi­
dent of the class, H. Adams. Various 
members of the class also had a lit­
tle to say.
Flowers were distributed as favors 
and proved, very popular. The menu 
with provision made for autographs, 
was quite unique.
and the wonderful windows, especially 
the rose windows of thirteenth century 
glass, are forever lost. Little villages 
which have been intact for hundreds 
of years have been completely wiped 
away. While from an artistic stand­
point these old houses are not impor­
tant, yet they made up the charm of 
the town. M. M. C. S. thanks Mr. 
Geoghan and eagerly awaits another 
lecture of this kind.
“ROSES IN DECEMBER” GIVEN AT CENTURY CLUB
On Tesday, December 4, in the Cen­
tury Club House', the Stage and Plays 
Society produced the one-act play, 
“Roses in December,” written and 
staged by Mrs. Elizabeth Moorhead 
Vermorcken, of the Margaret Morri­
son English department.
Another of the three plays given 
this evening was Bergamo’s “The 
Twins,” for which Mr. Goeghan, of 
Design School, wrote and presented 
the prologue. He also took the part 
of the “Captain.” Miss Demarest, 
Professor of History in Margaret Mor­
rison, took the part of “Nerine.”

Considerable Interest lias been 
aroused in the Nite Science School 
this year regarding a basketball team. 
At the Union, Friday evening, after 
the hand-sliake about twenty-five men 
signified their willingness and inten­
tion to come out for practice. About 
ten more men are expected to come 
out and from this number a fairly good 
team ought to be picked, as many of 
the men are quite adept at the game. 
A general meeting will be held to elect 
a manager. Arrangements will be 
made to obtain, the gym for practice 
and for a series of games following 
the return i.o school after the holidays.
This is the first Night Science ac­
tivity of an athletic nature and will 
bo followed with considerable, inter­
est. The indication points toward the 
night men entering more broadly into 
the general school affairs and events. 
If judged from previous Nite Science 
affairs, the basketball team should 
provo a success.
JANITOR PROVES TO BE NEW LITERARY GENIUS
The following masterpiece was 
posted on the Science School bulletin 
board ono morning last week. It was 
evidently composed by ono of the jan­
itors and should strike a sympathetic 
chord In the bosom of every Science 
student:
Pittsburgh December 5—1917.
Notice.
To all perciens staying in after light 
goes out you know that it is against 
j the rools of this building and for 
cralling out of windows is strictly for 
bidding get out before the door is 
Locked remember keep from going 
out of windows it is aganst the Law.
This remarkable edict was on the 
bulletin boards for only a short time. 
Perhaps some souvenir-gathering fiend 
appropriated it.
In spite of the element of humor at­
tached to this notice, there is also a 
serious phase, and the warning con­
tained therein should be heeded by 
all those who have been breaking “the 
Law.” Doubtless there will be an 
official action on the matter soon.
FRENCH COMMISSIONERS INSPECT PITT AND TECH
Lieutenant Renoo Engle, mombor 
of the French Industrial Commission 
to America, and Prof. Victor: Grignard, 
professor of chemistry at the Univer­
sity of Nancy, last Saturday inspected 
the Mellon Institute and Carnegie 
Tech. The French visitors are hunt­
ing industrial ideas for use during tho 
war.
Lieutenant Engle is quoted as hav­
ing said: “Our institutions have
stood as high, or possible higher, in 
the fine sciences, but you Americans 
seem to make more practical use of 
your research results. You have 
speed, and we certainly need that over 
there. We may be more exact in 
some things, but we do not need that 
so much as the ability to make what 
we know count. America’s leading

MR. GEORGHAN SPEAKS TO M. M. C. S. STUDENTS
Mr. Geoghan, of Dosign School, 
spoke on “Works of Art ’Which Have 
Been Destroyed by the Germans,” at: 
M. M. C. S. assembly last Wednesday. 
Slides of most of the cathedrals and 
works of art which have been de­
stroyed were shown. Mr. Geoghan 
pointed out that while the shell of the 
cathedral is in many cases still stand­
ing, the life of the building is gone. 
All the delicate traceries in the old 
Gothic buildings have been destroyed
