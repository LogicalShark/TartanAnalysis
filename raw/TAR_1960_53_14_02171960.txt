^Fraternity Rush Week 
To Be Feb. 21-28
This year, the Council of Fraternity Presidents is ini­
tiating a plan for a formal Rush Week for second semester.
Pushing will be conducted by all fraternities during the 
week of February 21 to 28. During this period undergradu- 
-^ates will be invited to fraternities#" 
dinnerfor lunches and dinner and for 
rush parties on Saturday, Febru­
ary 27. However, unlike the first 
semester rushing period, there 
will be no conducted tours of fra­
ternities.
VOOLUMM
The Rush Week will begin with 
a fraternity orientation address 
by Paul Farrell, the President of 
fcCJ. P.. •and a talk by Dr. Strick. 
These will-form part of a program 
to be held on Sunday, February 
21, at 2:00 p.m. in Breed Hall in 
the Margaret Morrison Building. 
Immediately following, there will 
be an informal discussion period 
with refreshments where there 
will be three representatives from 
each fraternity. The discussion 
period should-provide an excellent 
opportunity for men interested in 
^joining fraternities to learn more 
about the system and the individ­
ual chapters.

Report to Students
There Will Be A 
Thistle This Year
An article in last week’s VOLUOM informed you of the re­
cent reorganization of the Thistle staff.
Changes in personnel were effected in order to cope with 
organizational and financial difficulties within the Thistle and 
to assure you, as a potential ?----------------------
Thistle owner, that you would 
receive the best possible yearbook 
r*\!for your money. The new staff 
would like to report its progress 
toward achieving these goals.
tU4ULBN CL,TNUDM 
Two general problems were 
mentioned in the VOLUOM article. 
First, layout deadlines established 
by the printer were earlier than 
they had previously been. During 
the time in which reorganization 
was being considered, almost all 
Thistle activity was halted, but 
reproduction of the yearbook has 
now been resumed. The organiza-

tional structure of the staff has 
been revamped to make most 
effective use of the members’ 
talents and time, and we can as­
sure you that the Thistle will be 
published according to schedule 
and without sacrifice in quality.
The second problem involved 
financial matters, but this is a 
difficulty not so readily resolved 
by reorganization alone. Sales to 
date have been disappointing, but 
all the Thistle staff can do is to 
provide you with every opportu­
nity to buy a copy of our year­
book. This, of course, will be done.
Those of you who would like 
to help produce the yearbook may 
tell us how to contact you by 
leaving a message in Box 122, but 
we would like to remind you that 
buying a Thistle is just as im­
portant as producing it.

Kiltie Band Giving 
Winter Concept 
Tonight At 8:15
Carnegie Tech’s famed Kiltie 
Band will present its 16th annual 
Winter Concert at Carnegie Music 
Hall tonight at 8:15 p.m.
The band, under the direction 
of George Reynolds, will present 
a program of marches, dances, 
symphonic songs for band, and a 
number from a smash Broadway 
hit. The Kiltie Pipers, under the 
direction of Lewis Davidson, in 
his twentieth year as director of 
the unique-group, will ’take part 
in a procession at the start of the 
program and again following the 
intermission.
Fetes (Three Nocturnes) written 
by Claude Debussy and arranged

the featured numbers of the pro­
gram. Schaefer, who is band di­
rector at the University of South­
ern California, was director of the 
Kilties for a number of years im­
mediately following World War

established the band in its pres­
ent format. Other numbers sure to 
be of great interest include: “Sig- 
fried’s Rhine Journey” (Götter­

“Dance of the Buffoons” (Snow 
Maiden) by N. Rimsky Korsakov, 
and a selection from the West Side

Film Arts To Show 
‘Game of Love9
The film society premiere of “The Game of Love” takes 
place this Thursday afternoon and evening in Porter Hall 
100. It is the first in a series of fine film attractions offered 
by this semester’s Film Afts- Society.
Based on the widely read novel ? 
by Colette, “The Game of Love
presents possibly the most reveal­
ing, yet tastefully executed, love 
story that the motion picture has 
yet presented. It is a film to rank 
with the widely acclaimed “One 
Summer .of Happiness.”
wLU453 "DR,L1
Described by Colette as a “tale 
of love’s awakening” the recent 
French import is the story of the 
first love of a young girl and boy, 
and of the latter’s infatuation 
with a sophisticated, older woman. 
Gaining experienec through this 
affair, the boy returns ,to his girl 
only to find that their mutual af­
fection has matured into adult 
love. “The Game of Love” tells 
its story with great delicacy and 
understanding.
Although it is a story of young 
people, “The Game of Love” is 
meant to be seen by adult eyes. 
Made in 1954, the film still re­
mains on the lips of censors 
throughout the world today. Ban­
ned and cut in many countries, 
“The Game of Love” could only 
have been made in France, where
a candid approval to the problem 
oT sex is the rule rather than the 
exception. “Controversial” is the 
best word to describe this picture: 
for while “The Game of Love's” 
candor and realism has offeded 
many groups, many others, such 
as the “Catholic Times” have 
praised the film's delicacy and 
handling of an otherwise embar­
rassing subject.
Thursday
The Tech film group will present 
“The Game of Love” in its origin­
al, uncut, uncensored French ver­
sion. The Thursday showing will 
see intact many sequences in “The 
| Game of Love” that were cut for 
commercial American audiences. 
There are English subtitles.
“The Game of Love” is one in 
a series of outstanding film class­
ics to be presented each Thurs­
day in Porter Hall 100 at 4:40 and 
7:45 p.m.' in the Film Arts So­
ciety. Season passes are $2.25 for 
fourteen programs, and passes 
are available -at the door this 
Thursday.
Fraternities and Sororities 
Practmg For Mareli 4 Sin«*
While better than 500 of the members of Tech’s fraterni­
ties and sororities strain their vocal chords and work at 
the often difficult task of singing only the note that the 
composer has written, the final hour when musical perfec­
tion is a must is rapidly closing in#---------------------—
on them.
That is the night of March 4, 
the date of the annual Greek Sing 
competition at Carnegie Music 
Hall. The list of selections that 
will be presented by the Greeks 
has a lot of variety and promises 
to be a most entertaining pro­
gram.
The competition will be judged 
by more people this year than 
there were last year. The effect 
of this on the fairness and ac­
curacy of the choices may or may 
not be noticeable.
Selections 
The Greek Sing selections are: 
Alpha Epsilon Phi — “Hussar” 
and “Deep Purple.”
Delta Delta Delta—“The Echo 
Song” and “Love Lies Over the 
Hills.”
Chi Omega — “The Inchworm” 
and “In These Delightful Pleasant 
Groves.”
Delta Gamma—“May Now Thy 
Spirit” and “The Bells of Aber- 
doney.”
Kappa Alpha Theta — “Little 
Black Train” and “I Know Where 
I’m Going.”
Sigma Kappa—“April Dances” 
and “Barbara Allen.”
Kappa Kappa Gamma — "I’m 
Going Away” and “The Alphabet.” 
Phi Kappa Theta — “And This 
Is My Beloved” and “Nocturn.”
Sigma Alpha Epsilon—“Men of 
Harlach” and “Try A Little Ten­
derness.”
"41ULDÈMMÈ,4
Theta Xi — “Winter Sun” and 
“All Through the Night.”
Pi Kappa Alpha — “Haspodi 
Pomiloi” and “Marry A Woman 
Uglier Than You.”
Delta Upsilon — “Low Lands’* 
and “A-Roving.”

Today, as everyone knows, is the forty-sixth anniversary of the 
founding of Gransmire College for Women, which, as everyone 
knows, was the first Progressive Education college in the 
United States. •
Well do I recollect the tizzy in the academic world when 
Gransmire opened its portals! What a buzz there was, what a 
brouhaha in faculty common rooms, what a rattling of teacups, 
when Dr. Agnes Thudd Sigafoos, first president of Gransmire, 
lifted her learned old head and announced defiantly, “We will 
teach the student, not the course. There will be no marks, no 
exams, no requirements. This, by George, is Progressive 
Education!”
Well sir, forward-looking maidens all over the country cast 
©ff their fetters and came rushing to New Hampshire to enroll 
at Gransmire. Here they found freedom. They broadened t^heir 
vistas. They lengthened their horizons. They unstopped their 
bottled personalities. They roamed the campus in togas, lead­
ing ocelots on leashes.
And, of course, they smoked Marlboro cigarettes. (I saj',“Of 
course.” Why do I say, "Of course”? I say, “Of course” because 
it is a matter of course that anyone in search of freedom should 
naturally turn to Marlboro, for Marlboro is the smoke that sets 
the spirit soaring, that unyokes the captive soul, that fills the 
air with the murmur of wings. If you think flavor went out 
when filters came in—try Marlboro. They are sold in soft pack 
or flip-top box wherever freedom rings.) -
But all was not Marlboro and ocelots for the girls of Grans­
mire. There was work and study too-»-not in the ordinary sense, 
to be sure, for there were no formal classes. Instead there was 
a broad approach to enlarging each girl’s potentials, both mental 
and physical.
Take, for example, the course called B.M.S. (Basic Motor 
Skills). B.M.S. was divided into L.D. (Lying Down), S.U. 
(Standing Up) and W. (Walking). Once the student had mas­
tered L.D. and S.U., she was taught to W.—but not just to W. 
any old way! No, sir! She was taught to W. with poise, 
dignity, bearing! To inculcate a sense of balance in the girl, 
she began her exercises by walking with a suitcase in each hand. 
(One girl, Mary Ellen Dorgenicht, got so good at it that today 
}he is bell captain at the Deshler-Hilton Hotel in Columbus,
The Game Of Love: Probably The Finest Motion Picture Ever Made Based 
Upon A Love Story. Showing This Thursday As One In A Series Of Fourteen Film 
Classics Offered By This Spring’s Film Arts Society. Tickets Will Be On Sale At The 
Door For $2.25 For Th§ Series. Showings Of “The Game Of Love” In Porter Hall 100 
Will Be At 4:40, 7:45 And 9:30.*
When the girls had walking under their belts, they were 
allowed to dance. Again no formality was imposed. They were 
simply told to fling themselves about in any way their impulses 
dictated, and, believe you me, it was quite an impressive sight 
to see them go bounding into the woods with their togas flying. 
(Several later joined the U.S. Forestry Service.)
There was also a lot of finger painting ajid sculpture with 
coat hangers and like that, and soon the fresh wind of Progres- 
sivism came whistling out of Gransmire to blow the ancient dust 
of pedantry off curricula everywhere, and today, thanks to the 
pioneers at Gransmire, we are all free.
If you are ever in New Hampshire, be sure to visit the Grans- 
mire campus. It is now a tannery. / - • i»«o sbuim»«

TMCA Plans 
Church Visits
The YMCA and YWCA are 
planning a series of two visits to 
churches of special interest and of 
traditions not so well known.

terested in learning more about 
the Jewish tradition may meet at
:40 a.m. at Morewood Gardens 
to proceed to the Rodef Shalom 
Congregation where the service 
begins at 11:00. One of the staff

Scotch and Soda 
Exhibits Name 
For 1960 Show
For the past month, signs hint- 
È1È at the Scotch & Soda 1960 
shows’ name have been exhibited 
at various points across the cam- 
Ais (trees, lampposts, ceilings, and 
aormitory rooms).
Grounds maintenance keepers, 
unfortunate weather, and poster- 
snatching students may have pro­
hibited a large number of these 
signs from being appreciated. 
Numbering five in all, the clue 
posters all convey basically the 
same theme, the title of Scotch ’n 
Soda’s 1960 spring production.
Series
jkThe first in the series depicted 
me main character of the signs 
sitting upon a rock pile. In the 
next, he has met a charming Miss 
who is featured standing on a 
glittering diamond engagement 
ring. In number three, said char­
acter was blissfully floating in a 
goblet of gin and tonic. A true 
navigator at heart, he found his 
ship in distress upon an iceberg 
in number four. San Quentin is 
Wie final resting place and event 
wal hunting ground of Mr. X as 
he labored on the rocks. (Which 
if you haven’t by now guessed, is 
the title of our show!)
Scotch ’n Soda’s “On the Rocks 
promises to be the greatest orig­
inal musical ever produced on 
Tech’s campus. Don Beaman, 
president of the club promises a 
dazzling show brimming with hu 
mor and excitement. This revue 
.combines everyday experience 
with the absurd and its sketches 
produce a variety of emotional 
thrills.
Because of the broad scope ,W 
“On the Rocks,” more performers 
will be used in this show than in 
those of past years. Students with 
any type of talent for the theatre 
are urged to attend cast auditions 
this Saturday and next. (For fur 
ther information check the “Bul­
letin Board” section of this week’s

at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City.
Ross’ music is billed as “A Ser­

this villing indicates, he plays 
dance music in an easy going

which he promises we will hear

No other car in the low-priced three 
can match the borne-on-the-wind 
sensation you get from a ride in the 
1960 Chevrolet. But that’s not sur­
prising when you consider to what 
lengths Chevy has gone to provide 
for your comfort at no extra cost to, 
you. As you drive, count the ways 
Chevrolet has been thoughtful:
Supple Full Coil suspension—
Coil springs at all four wheels melt 
bumps as no other suspension can. 
Taking the punch out of rough roads 
is their only function—they don’t 
have to anchor the rear axle.
Butyl rubber body mounts—
Thicker, newly designed body mounts
further insulate you from the road.
Body by Fisher—Only Chevy in 
its field offers the polish and crafts­
manship of Body by Fisher.
Foam cushioned seats—Chevy 
offers foam cushioned seats in both 
front and rear in all series but one. 
Saffety-Girder frame—X-built 
and not merely X-braced, the Safety- 
Girder frame affords greater rigidity 
to minimize twisting and squeaks.
Hydraulic valve lifters—Oil
hushed hydraulic valve lifters reduce 
engine noise to a whisper.
Cushioned steering shaft—
A universal joint and cushioned 
coupling keep those annoying road 
tremors from the steering wheel.
Precision balanced wheels and 
tires—Here again Chevy has showa 
concern for your comfort by elimi­
nating vibration in this vital area— 
tire life is longer, too.
Easy steering ratio—Chevy’s high 
ratio Ball Race steering takes th® 
work out of steering for you.
Superior weight distribution—
Chevy rides better, handles better 
and stops better because the car’s 
weight is more equally divided be­
tween the front and rear wheels.
Wide choice of power teams—
Choose from 24 different power com­
binations to satisfy 
the itchiest driving 
foot—more than OMg 
other car.

I am writing about your February 10 editorial, “A Sad 
State of Affairs,” which deplores the opposition of so many 
of our political and educational leaders to the “disclaimer
affidavit” requirement in the Na-^~-------——-----------
tional Defense Education Act.
That Act, as you omitted to 
point out, provides both that the 
recipient of aid shall take an oath 
of loyalty to the United States 
and also that he be required to 
eign an affidavit “that he does 
not believe in, and is not a mem­
ber of, and does not support any 
organization that believes in or 
teaches the overthrow of the 
United States by force or violence 
. . President Eisenhower, as you 
know, has joined many political 
leaders of both parties and many 
educators in advocating the re­
peal of the affidavit requirement.
You mention some of the argu­
ments made by those favoring re­
peal: The affidavit singles out
needy students for special treat­
ment, as though they were some­
how particularly suspect. It ac­
complishes nothing which the oath 
cf loyalty does not already accom­
plish. Both the oath and the af­
fidavit are in any cast largely fu­
tile gestures, since disloyal per­
sons will swear and sign without 
compunction.
Principle
But by far the most important 
objection to the affidavit is one 
of principle. A basic tenet of the 
American democratic faith holds 
that a person’s beliefs are his own 
business, and that officials have 
no right to demand that he answer 
questions about them in order to 
receive benefits for which he is 
otherwise eligible.
You speak of “the many who 
have given their lives so that the 
United States could survive.” Have 
you reflected on how many of
those and how many others in 
the past few centuries, were fight­
ing for such ideals as freedom of 
speech and of the press, freedom 
of religion and of belief? These 
are principles not lightly to be 
abandoned.»
Basic Leberties
Too many people who claim to 
believe in our basic liberties are 
in reality only willing to extend 
them to the virtuous, the innocent, 
and the right-thinking. But the 
essence of those liberties is that 
they are extended to all American, 
subject only to the provision that 
they may be withdrawn when 
their misuse endangers the com­
munity.
It may seem to you a trivial 
breacji of the principal that be­
lief and opinion should be unfet­
tered to require students to dis­
claim any belief in an overthrow 
of our government, since most 
and perhaps all potential grantees 
have no such belief. But many 
educational leaders feel deeply 
that all breaches of this principle 
must be resisted, lest a precedent 
for the official censorship of be­
liefs and opinions be established. 
Moreover, these educational lead­
ers particularly resent tha]t /the 
colleges and universities, which 
have always encouraged and de­
fended unfettered speech and 
opinion in this country, should be 
called upon to administer the af­
fidavit requirement. I, for one, am 
convinced that their position is 
right.
Cordially yours,
James L. Houghteling, Jr.

“The Game of Love” is an appropriate beginning to the 
spring semester offerings of our Film Arts Society. Not . ^ly 
is spring the season of love, but this motion picture clean} 
demonstrates an aspect of the “art” of cinema—that is, the
handling of a delicate topic with ?————----------------
proverbial “kid gloves.”
The film is fascinating. It peeps 
over the garden wall and reports 
accurately what it has seen in a 
production that is excellently 
acted and imaginatively staged.
“The Game of Love” shows a 
young man, sixteen, learning 
about sex from an older woman 
and teaching it to a fifteen year- 
old blossom of a girl. Although it 
teeters on a razor’s edge on in­
delicacy, the film is full of bril­
liant touches.
Unlike “The Lovers,” which 
presented a somewhat distorted 
attitude toward love (that it can 
be a passing glance), “The Game 
of Love” is true to life, sympa­
thetic, tender, and glows with 
warm radiance. It is much like 
the Swedish “One Summer of 
Happiness” as a motion picture of 
undeniable artistic integrity: ex­
cellent entertainment in any lan­
guage.
But the uncensored “Game of 
Love” seems to be only one of 
many scoops for the society this 
spring. Most important will be 
the arrival (from Holland) of the 
second portion of the Chaplin tril­
ogy. It we can judge from part 
one, which received such excel­
lent raves in our community; this 
second Chaplin program is assured 
of success. George Diehl will be 
there, with piano, adding the mus­
ical polish.
The new color version of 
“Oedipus Rex” will be here in 
another few weeks, as will Alfred 
Hitchcock’s rarely seen, “Black­
mail.” “A Nous La Liberte,” 
“Rashomon,” “Safety Last,” “The 
Informer,” “Joan of Arc,” ets., are 
just a few of the movies to be 
shown on the campus this semes­
ter. Surrielist and experimental 
shorts are

How to avoid a “dead end” career: 
read Dick Petzold’s story
While a senior at the University of Mary­
land, accounting major Richard G. 
Petzold made some definite decisions 
about his future. “I wanted to work for 
an established company,” be says, “but I 
didn’t want to get lost in a ‘dead end’ job.”
Dick joined the Chesapeake and Po­
tomac Telephone Company in Washing­
ton, D. C., right after graduating in June, 
1956. Following three months of orien­
tation, he became a supervisor in Reve­
nue Accounting, where he continued 
training in a productive capacity, with 15 
people reporting to him. Here, he sug­
gested a number of methods improve­
ments which were adopted.
Far from a “dead end” career, Dick’s 
took him into many operating areas:
• to General Accounting, where he 
handled market research projects, includ­
ing a Customer Opinion Survey for four 
Bell System companies ...
• to Disbursements Accounting, for 
IBM-equipment training and, later on, 
the supervision of Payroll Deduction 
procedures...
• to Personnel Relations, where he co­
ordinated a special, four-company “ab­
sentee” study and presented findings to 
an important, top-level conference...
• to Disbursements Accounting again, 
where he is now Supervisor, Labor and 
Material, with an administrative assistant 
and 10 clerks under his guidance.
“The telephone company brings out 
the best in you,” says Dick. “I’ve devel­
oped new skills, acquired self-reliance, 
and learned how to supervise and work 
with people. What’s the opposite of a 
‘dead end’ career? Well, I’ve got it!”

plorers’ Club.
The entrance, discovered several 
months ago in field work by Bruce 
Godwin and several NSS people, 
is a vertical shaft 95 feet deep, 
with smooth limestone walls. It 
was descended for the first time 
on January 30 by a team includ­
ing Godwin, Dave Yens, Bob An­
derson, and Hugh Young.
The technique used to descend 
the pit was to climb down a light­
weight ladder made of steel 
cables and rungs of 3/8" alumi­
num tubing. The climbers were 
protected from any possibility of 
a fall by a 7/16" nylon safety rope 
carefully belayed at the surface. 
This rope has a tensile strength of 
approximately 5000 lbs.
At the bottom of the entrance 
shaft the explorers found a series' 
of six inter-connected domed 
chambers 80 to 100 feet in height. 
The floor of the sixth room was 
estimated to be at least 135 feet 
below the surface.
The Explorers’ Club has recent­
ly announced its program of activ­
ities for February and March, and 
schedules are posted on several 
bulletin boards. Included -are 
meetings on the second and fourth 
Tuesday of each month (in AH

are always welcome at these 
events.
Of special interest is a Climb­
ing School intended particularly

teach special techniques used in 
safe rock climbing and cave ex­
plorations. The school will begin

Earl J. Birdy 
Appointed New 
Assistant Coach
By Joe Lang
It was announced last Friday, 
February 12, that Mr. Earl J. 
Birdy has been appointed the new 
assistant track coach at Carnegie 
Tech. Mr. Birdy has undertaken 
this roll voluntarily and will be 
adding this activity to his regular 
t^fching chor&s in the physical 
intramural department.
Mr. Birdy had been an instruc­
tor pince coming to Tech, but he 
is presently an assistant professor 
in Tech’s physical education de­
partment. He has spent four years 
teaching the instructors course in 
Life Saving and Water Safety, and 
spent 1955-1957 as head of Tech’s 
intramural director.
Mr. Birdy’s appointment has 
b^n made in an effort to better 
the quality of our varsity track 
team, and to stimulate an interest 
in the team amongst Tech stu­
dents. He believes that the futpre 
of the team lies in this year’s 
freshman and sophomore combat­
ants; however, he desires to see 
any student, regardless of class, 
interested in participating in track 
come to an organizational meet­
ing on Friday, February 19, at 
4# p.m. in the Black Cat Lounge.

teams, there were some outstand­
ing team and individual perform­
ances. Obelisk A became the first 
team to break the magic 2500 
mark this season. They overpow­
ered DTD, against whom they 
were matched, by almost 500 pins. 
Four of their five bowlers hit the 
five hundred mark, and captain, 
(wmichael rolled the high series 
of the day with a 571, highlighted 
by a 210 game.

SAE P continued their fine per­
formance in rolling a 2385 series 
and downing PKT by more than 
300 pins. Harvey paced the SAE’s 
with a 540 series. ATO A again 
proved they were a team to be 
reckoned with as they defeated 
a tough Saturday Bachelor quin­
ts At the end of two games it 
was still any ones match, but the 
Alpha Tau’s caught fire and 
smothered their opponents by 
more than 100 pins. MacEwen 
led the ATO attack with a 524 
series.
Sigma Nu easily ^defeated BSR 
as they rolled a 2278 series, paced 
by captain McClean’s 531 and 
Sprenkle’s 210 game. All of the 
victories were clean sweeps ex-

match. Although ATO lost one

To: Students With An Interest In TrackReber Chosen 
Volleyball MVP 
For This Year

sons in track at Carnegie Tech, 
we are attempting to get back on 
a winning basis. We have a new 
coaching set-up which will fur­
nish better coaching, more in­
struction. and better organization. 
We will soon have surpassed by
no one in our class, when our new 
stadium is completed.
In our quest for the track 
championship and the West Penn 
Conference All-Sports Trophy, we 
ask your assistance. You need not 
have been a track man in the 
past. If you have the initiative
and interest to particip 
track, you are invited to ti 
ganizational track meeting ?

Coaching Staff.
The week after the volleyball 
season ended, the most valuable 
player was selected.
The person selected as the cam­
pus’ best was, for the fourth con­
secutive year, an SAE. Bob Reber, 
senior E. E. from Palmerton, Pa., 
was an almost unanimous choice 
for the honor.
Bob captained this year’s SAE 
team and led them to another un­
defeated season. Since starting his 
volleyball career five years ago, 
Bob made the. All-School first 
team for his fourth time. There 
was no spiker in the school more 
consistent than he in spiking. 
Good sets always resulted in a 
hard, well-placed spike by 
“Rebob,” and if the set was poor, 
the opposing team was still un­
able to relax because he was still 
able to return a hard spike some­
how.
The runner-up for the honor 
was Dick Aust, SAE senior. Dick 
was a spiking partner of Bob’s. 
Bill Stevenson, SN spiker, came 
in third.
