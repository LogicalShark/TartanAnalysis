»1----U,. WT__L O OBrotherhood Week 
Precedes Discussions
Dr. George F. Thomas, of 
Princeton University, is the fea­
tured speaker at next Tuesday’s 
Assembly, following up today’s 
program in the Little Theater. 
Father Tom Murphy, Rabbi Solo­
mon Freehoff, and the Reverend 
John C. Smith are speaking today 
on the theme of Brotherhood 
Week.
Next week is Religious Discus­
sion Week, with meetings of vari­
ous Tech organizations with re­
ligious leaders, and high-lighted 
by Dr. Thomas’s talk.
Dr. Thomas was a 'Rhodes 
Scholar, receiving his Bachelor’s 
degree with honors in Theology 
from Oxford in 1923, and later 
taking his Ph. D. in Philosophy at 
Harvard in 1929. He has been 
Professor of Philosophy at 
Swarthmore College (1927-1931), 
at Dartmouth College (1931-1937), 
and at the University of North 
Carolina (1937-1940). Since 1940, 
he has been Professor of Re­
ligious Thought at Princeton. Dr. 
Thomas is the author of “Spirit 
and Its Freedom,” and the editor 
of “The Vitality of the Christian 
Tradition.” He has been since

Stardust Swing 
Proves Success
Since it was too cold to dance 
outside, Techites at the Stardust 
Swing last Friday did the next 
best thing. The artificial sky un­
der which they danced was the 
midnight blue of a summer eve­
ning. Yellow lights provided ro­
mantic moonlight, and silver stars 
were so low that one could reach 
up and touch them. Couples not 
carried out of this world by the 
music of Baron Elliott and his 
Orchestra, sat at tables placed 
cabaret style oi- sipped drinks 
(soft, of course) in the Black Cat 
(which was gallantly manned by 
APO).
The only incident which marred 
the perfection of an otherwise 
lovely evening was the arrival of 
a native runner from Tlanganyika 
with the disappointing news that 
the famous, eagerly-awaited Dr. 
R. H. Coo, because of transporta­
tion difficulties, would be unable 
to grace the dance with his scin­
tillating presence.
Notice
On Tuesday, February 19, 
from 12:30 to 3:30 P. M. Stu­
dent Council will hold a spe­
cial election for the candidates 
competing for the Engineer­
ing Voting Representative to 
Student Council. The candi­
dates for this one-semester po­
sition are Robert D. Teasdale 
and Louis Umbach, Jr.
Students must present their 
Student Identification Cards 
at the polls.
Tech’s Kiltie Band 
Will Re-organize, 
Needs More Men
After two years of suspended 
animation due to the war. the 
Kilties, Tech’s famous Scottish 
band, will soon come into its own 
again. An organizational meeting 
has been called by George Yurchi- 
son, student manager, and Jay 
Maratta, student director, for to­
morrow, Wednesday, February 20, 
at Thistle Hall, 4:30 P. M. It is 
hoped that many applicants for 
membership in the band will ap­
pear, and everyone interested in 
playing for the Kilties is urged to 
come. Extensive musical experi­
ence on the part of the applicant 
is not necessary.
At present there is a nucleus of 
about thirty Kilties, who have 
been playing at pep rallies. Since 
the marching band usually consists 
of 100 members, there is plenty of 
opportunity for expansion. Mr. 
Morrow, of the Music Department 
will direct the band’s practice and 
by next fall the Kilties will be in 
top-notch shape for the football 
games. Mr. Davidson has under­
taken to teach 8 novitiates the 
not-so-gentle art of playing the 
bagpipes. Volunteers will be 
gladly accepted; no experience is 
required. Examination of the im­
ported Scotch Kilts reveals them 
to be in perfect condition and other 
equipment will soon be ready, too.
Before the war the Kilties were 
well-known in the Tri-State Dis­
trict. They played community 
get-togethers, hospitals, and radio 
programs, as well as at Tech 
games and other shindigs. Their 
repertoire was not confined to jazz 
and maching music; in fact the 
Kilties gave a formal concert 
every Spring. All signs indicate 
that the new Kilties will be as fine 
a band as the old one was.

Tech Professor, 
Dr. Berl, Dies
Dr. Ernest Berl, former research 
professor in the Chemical Engi­
neering .Department., died on Feb­
ruary 16th at the age of 68. Dr. 
Berl, considered as one of Ger­
many’s greatest chemists before 
he joined the faculty at Carnegie 
in 1933, w?as brought to this coun­
try by Thon\as S. Baker, late 
president of Tech. He served with 
notable distinction until his re­
tirement in July 1945.
The most publicized of his 
contributions to chemical science 
was his 1940 announcement that 
he had synthesized coal and oil 
from plants at a relatively low 
cost.
Dr. Berl worked as a consulting 
chemist with the Tennessee Val­
ley Authority, the Department of 
Agriculture, the Chemical War­
fare Service, and Navy Ordnance 
Department. Under a Buhl Foun­
dation grant in 1942, he began 
experimenting to increase “the 
scope of research in gas warfare 
and explosive technology.”
He was iborn in Austrian Silesia 
in 1877 and educated at the Uni­
versity of Vienna and the Uni­
versity of Zurich. In 1938 he was 
naturalized at a U. S. Citizen.
He lived in the Schenley Apart­
ments and is survived by his wid­
ow, Mrs. Margaret Berl, and two 
sons, Dr. Walter G. Berl and Lt. 
Herbert Berl.
H. C. Hawes, Canadian, 
Visits Printing Dep’t
On Wednesday, February 13, 
Mr. H. C. Hawes from Toronto, 
Ontario, visited Carnegie Tech to 
study the organization of the 
Printing Department. Mr. Hawes 
is Supervisor of the School of 
Graphic Arts of the Training and 
Re-Establishment Institute of To­
ronto. He is in charge of the pub­
lishing and printing training for 
the Veterans Rehabilitation Pro­
gram in Canada. He chose to visit 
Tech because the Printing De­
partment here is the most ad­
vanced school of its kind in the 
country.
Mr. Hawes made a general sur­
vey, with particular emphasis on 
the machinery and equiment 
and curriculum. He plans to use 
this material for setting up a 
similar system in Canada, al­
though the system which will be 
employed there will not be as ad­
vanced as it is here.
Dorm Council 
Holds Election
In a meeting held last night, 
February 18, 1946, in the lounge 
of Welch Hall, the officers of the 
Men’s Dormitory Council were 
elected. This action brings to re­
ality the aim of a small group 
of dormitory residents which has 
been the motivating factor in the 
reactivation of this organization 
on Tech’s campus.
The officers of the MDC for this 
semester are as follows: President 
—George Maley; Vice-President— 
Robert Brill; Recording Secretary 
—Everrett Hoffman; Correspond­
ing Secretary—Victor Wales; and 
Budget Director—Raymond Ben- 
ec-ki; Mr. Frank A. Eyman, Head 
of the Men’s Dormitories, is the 
permanent Treasurer of the Coun­
cil. The council will meet on the 
first and third Monday of each 
month at 10:45 A. M.
Election of the representatives 
to the Men’s Dormitory Council 
from each of the dormitories was 
held Monday, February 11, 1946. 
The members of the Council are: 
from Scobell Hall: hall president 
Ray Benecki, and Rolland Locke, 
Stan Hyde, Jim deVenney, and 
Bob Reutzel: from Welch Hall: 
Hall president Andy Kuhl, and 
Stan Dreskin, George Maley, Pete 
Bartelson, and Dave Lide: and 
from Henderson Hall: hall presi­
dent Bob Brill, and Vic Wales, 
Dick Storm, Tut Hoffman, and 
Chuck Kavanaugh.
High in order of importance on 
the agenda of the Council is the 
problem of getting the “Dorm 
Bagpiper” back into print. Both 
the men and women residents of 
Tech’s dormitory system have 
shown definite interest in this 
publication, and, with coopera­
tion and organization, the “Bag­
piper” will soon be functioning 
again.
Frats, Independents 
Present Candidates 
For Campus Monarch
The first all-school, semi-for­
mal dance of the Spring semester 
will be held on Saturday night, 
February 23, from 9:00 until 1:00 
in the Webster Hall. Brad Hunt 
and his orchestra have been se­
cured to furnish the music.
The dance will be known as the 
“King of Hearts Ball”, and that 
motif will be carried out in the 
decorations. As has been the re­
cent custom here at Tech, there 
will be no flowers. The evening’s 
entertainment, under the spon­
sorship of Mortar Board, can be 
yours for the sum of $2.40 per 
couple. Tickets may be purchased 
from any member of Mortar 
Board or in Skibo. As also has 
been the custom, A. P. O. will 
handle the refreshments.
The big moment of the dance 
will be the crowning of the “King 
of Hearts”. Candidates have been 
nominated by each of the frater­
nities and the independents. The 
voting will take place at the 
dance with each couple receiving’ 
two votes as they arrive. The bal­
lots will be counted, and the king 
will be crowned during intermis­
sion. The remainder of the even­
ing’s entertainment will honor his 
reigning majesty.
Dorothy Feldman has been 
serving as Chairman in charge 
of the dance committee, and Jean 
Garland has been taking charge 
of getting the candidates. All the 
members of Mortar Board, how­
ever, have taken an active part 
in the preparation.
The candidates for the honor 
of “The King of Hearts” are as 
follows: Beta Sigma Rho—Alex 
Sherman; Beta Theta Pi—Wil­
liam Thurnhurst; Delta Tau Del­
ta — Mystery Man; Delta Up­
silon—Robert Kindi; Phi Kappa— 
Francis Goldcamp; Pi Kappa Al­
pha—Andrew Krestel; Sigma Al­
pha Epsilon — Michael Yanitor; 
Tau Delta Phi — Alan “Buddy” 
Yorkin; Theta Xi—Charles Sut­
ton; and Independents—Jack De- 
vine.
Technical, Campus Publication, 
Plans Extensive Improvements
Though it is a highly unpubli­
cized fact, this year marks the 
tenth anniversary of Carnegie 
Tech’s most well known publica­
tion, the Carnegie Technical. The 
TechnicaVs mailing list includes 
individuals, business offices, and 
industrial concerns from all over 
the United States, as well as ex­
change copies sent to colleges. 
The TechnicaVs popularity stems 
from the high specific gravity of 
the content; impartial observers 
rate its articles on a par with 
similar articles written by staffs 
on the graduate level. It’s no sur­
prise, then, that the Technical 
attracts expensive advertisements 
and usually finds itself with the 
highest cash balance on the cam­
pus. (Don’t get any ideas, now, 
boys.)
Perhaps one of the reasons for 
the TechnicaVs excellence is its 
policy of 'continuing improve­
ments. This year, for instance, the 
project is to obtain the aid of a 
faculty advisory staff to improve 
the quality of the work. In the 
past the editors have shouldered 
the heavy burden of revising and 
confirming the complex and some­
times recondite articles. But 
henceforth more experienced 
members of the faculty will take 
over. The following faculty mem­
bers have indicated their willing­
ness to participate in this pro­
gram, each man being advisor for 
articles in his own field.
Prof. D. C. Saylor, Mechanical 
Engineering.
Mr. D. L. Trautman, Electrical 
Engineering.
Prof. E. A. Whitman, Mathe­
matics.
Dr. D. F. Miner, Management 
Engineering.
Prof. Charles Williamson, Phys­
ics. ,
Dr. J. P. Fugassi, Chemistry.
Prof. C. C. Monrad, Chemical 
Engineering.
Prof. Gehhard Derge, Metal­
lurgy.
Prof. C. W. Muhlenbruch, Civil 
Engineering.
Professors L. M. Beattie and D. 
M. Goodfellow, English.
Prof. S. W. Chapman, Humani­
ties.
These advisors will also be 
available to the students writing 
the articles, if they so desire. The 
program will be in full swing by 
next fall.
Improvements are also planned 
in the Technical’s format. To se­
cure uniformity of graphs and 
line drawings, special drafting 
equipment is being purchased. 
Chief draftsmen A1 Macyanskas 
will also get a new lettering guide 
for printing. And Gus Kermes,

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY i9, 1946
Editor’s Armchair
Brotherhood
This week Americans all over the country are priding them­
selves in the fact that they are observing “National* Brotherhood 
Week.” They are gathering together in churches, in assembly 
halls, and in ballrooms, and over ornate banquet tables, they are 
expressing noble thoughts and ideas about the equality of man, 
and about the glorious American ideals of love, and democracy, 
and freedom for all. However, in this glorious America which 
ostensibly cherishes the ideals of love and democracy and free­
dom, the fact that it is necessary to set aside one week of the 
year in which we become aware for a brief moment of the equal­
ity of man, reveals the ironic truth that we are failing to achieve 
these high minded and worthy goals.
It is true that in this country all people are permitted to wor­
ship as they choose, it is true that people born with a skin color 
a few shades darker than that of the majority are not frequently 
physically persecuted here, but despite all the high sounding 
phrases, it is not true that the American Jew and the American 
Negro actually possess the economic political, religious, and so­
cial equality that they are supposedly guaranteed by our Con­
stitution. In almost every city and town across the nation, the 
Negro and the Jew are refused jobs because of their religion and 
their race. In the south, the negro is in effect forbidden to vote 
by the poll tax. The Negro and the Jew are in many cases banned 
from all but the poorest residential districts by their fellow 
Americans who consider them socially unacceptible as neighbors, 
and although he is allowed to worship as he chooses without fear 
of bodily harm, the Jew is psychologically, if not physically, per­
secuted for his religion in the United States.
This inequality and discrimination often incurs national at­
tention, but it is the common everyday and almost minute evi­
dence of intolerance shown by Mr. Average Citizen, or Mr. 
Average Student that is the real root of America’s failure to 
equal her ideal. It is the easuel remark, the subtle snobbery, the 
cruel clique, the pointed and totally humorless joke. It is the 
sign on the hotel, “Restricted Clientele,” it is the unwritten law 
of the social organization “Restricted Cientele.” It is the unsent 
invitation to an all-class party, the whispered insult, the re­
peated, “Sorry, busy tonight. No Date.” It is the little people 
who limit their circle of friends, excluding their constitutional 
brothers who spread prejudice and intolerance.
"When our makers of our constitution stated that all men 
are created equal, they were not just dreaming dreams. People 
are actually pretty much alike. Whether their skin is black, 
white, or yellow; whether they prefer to worship in synagogues, 
or cathedrals or stuffy cellars, whether they call their god Mo­
hammed, Allah, or the King of Men, whether their names are 
Smith or Kasticovitchkv, people are much the same. They laugh 
and erv, grieve and rejoice, love and hate and dream in much the 
same way.
Weeks set aside in the name of a worthy cause are often 
ignored by too self conscious citizens, and moralizing is gener­
ally shunned or ridiculed, but there is no escape from the fact 
that,just a little more real tolerance, patience, and understanding 
can go along way toward making America the democracy it 
claims to be. Stop before you make that cutting, intolerant re­
mark, before you change your seat in the streetcar. Remember 
that it is only chance that made the difference, that you might 
now be hurt by the cruel remarks of another people, that you 
might now be crushed by the weight of prejudice. Do your part 
to eliminate the need for “National Brotherhood Week.”

The following letters have
been received in reply to Mr.
Teasdale’s letter which ap­
peared in last week’s TAR­
TAN.
REPLY TO RDT
In last week’s Tartan there ap­
peared! charges directed at Scim­
itar and Delta Skull, and at Stu­
dent Council, responsible for the 
reorganization of the two men’s 
class honoraries. These charges 
showed an amazing lack of analy­
sis, and are for the most part in­
valid and made without a knowl­
edge of the facts behind the reor­
ganization program. As chairman 
of the Men’s Points Committee of 
Student Council, I will take the 
responsibility for correcting some 
of R. D. T.’s mistaken conceptions. 
Since he has preferred the medium 
of the newspaper to present infor­
mal charges rather than directing 
them straight to Student Council, 
I will also use the Tartan so that 
the whole question will be put 
squarely before the whole campus 
in order to end any doubts and 
rumor now existing. I will reply 
to specific charges with specific 
answers, and show where the com­
plaints made so far have been 
petty, unconstructive, and not feas­
ible under the circumstances.
The first specific charge made 
was with regard to factor require­
ments. One man chosen to Scim­
itar did have under a 0.6 factor, 
but resigned when he realized the 
Constitution requirements, (this 
he did before last week’s Tartan 
appeared, but after R. D. T.’s let­
ter had already gone to press). 
One Delta Skull member did have 
under a 1.75 factor last semester, 
but if R. D. T. had taken the 
trouble to carefully study all parts 
of the Constitution, he would have 
discovered that the requirement 
is an average factor of 1.75, which 
was met in this case.
Next, R. D. T. chooses to discuss 
the removal of the point system 
for this first election of members. 
He had heard that this was done 
for two reasons—“to avoid the ex­
cessive difficulty of tabulation, 
particularly for returning veter­
ans, and to get a better cross sec­
tion of the eligible students.” The 
first part is, of course, the primary 
reason, since any tabulation of 
points would be very inaccurate. I 
don’t know where the second rea­
son stated above came from, be­
cause it was never made in any 
Committee meeting, and I am sure 
no other Student Council member 
ever made any such statement in 
any meeting. But it is an interest­
ing point. I would like to know 
how R. D. T. defines “a good cross 
section of the eligible students.” 
Let him again consult the Consti­
tution and he will find that the 
primary reason for selection is for 
work on activities, all activities, 
of which fraternity membership is
one of the lesser rated activities 
(in number of points)- counting 
towards membership. If he will 
look at the roster of men on Delta 
Skull and Scimitar, he will find 
that all activities are well repre- 
sentedi — publications, varsity 
sports, intramural sports, musical 
organization, Tecvets, Student 
Council, Y-cabinet, scholarship, 
and other honoraries; in fact the 
whole field of activities at Car­
negie.
Other reasons for not applying 
the point system this one time, if 
they are needed, can be stated as 
follows: Besides the difficulty in 
tabulation and the impossibility of 
recording points earned as far 
back as four or five years, there 
is also the fact that during the 
war there were too few activities 
to permit extensive participation. 
Men were needed now who were 
capable of leadership, but who had 
not had too many opportunities 
for expression during the war. The 
organization’s rejuvenation might 
be jeopardized if such men were 
excluded. Although it was not pos­
sible to follow the Constitution 
strictly, Student Council made 
every effort to live up to the spirit 
behind it. A list of activities was 
drawn up for each man consid­
ered to give some guide to basis of 
membership. Activities and qual­
ities of leadership were carefully 
considered and formed the basis 
for final selection.
And of what value is an accusa­
tion that a Scimitar has been 
known to cheat on two separate 
examinations? On a campus which 
does not recognize the merits of 
an Honor System, and where 
without too much trouble, a ma­
jority of students can be seen 
cheating in some form or another, 
what right has any one student to 
accuse another? Let’s install an 
Honor System first, and then such 
an objection will be valid. And 
why wasn’t objection made before 
the selection, when it was the 
logical time? The list of men be­
ing considered was posted for ten 
days with the provision made for 
adding of other names to be con­
sidered along with provision for 
submitting reasons why any man 
should not be accepted. If no ob­
jection could be raised then, why 
should it be made later when elec­
tion of men had already taken 
place?
Of what value is the objection 
to the method of selection of of­
ficers? The president could not be 
selected according to the Consti­
tution which states that “the pres­
idents of the honoraries shall be 
those called' with the greatest 
number of points.” Since no points 
were tabulated this time, no sound 
basis existed for the selection of 
president, and the alternative was 
adopted — the presidents were 
elected according to the provision
for the other officers, i. e. that they 
be elected by majority popular 
vote of the organization. This is 
what was done.
The last point which R. D. T. 
makes is absolutely correct, but I 
fail to see why it should bother 
him. It applies only to this one 
semester. Membership on both 
ODK and Delta Skull is legal, 
since ODK, the national honorary, 
permits the election of juniors, al­
though this is seldom done norm­
ally. When the question of mem­
bership on Delta Skull came up 
before Student Council, Mr. Nut­
ter and Mr. Straka accepted only 
when reassured that nobody could 
be excluded by their acceptance. 
There are at present only eleven 
Delta Skulls (out of maximum of 
fifteen). I can give Mr. Teasdale 
reassurance that such a situation 
will probably never occur again.
It should be obvious that both men 
can make a positive contribution 
to the organization.
I think that when the situation 
is analyzed in the light of all the 
facts and the nature of the situa­
tion, there will be found no basis 
of the criticisms made to date. 
They are far too small to be seri­
ously considered, but if anyone 
has any other really constructive 
criticism, it will be received by 
Student Council and carefully 
considered. I am still waiting to 
hear of any suggestions that will 
be of use.
Sincerely,
A. E. Binder.
DELTA SKULL REPLIES
Last week a letter written by 
R. D. T. appeared in the Tartan 
concerning the Delta Skull and 
Scimitar Honoraries. As members 
of Delta ¡Skull, w'e wish to point 
out some facts regarding the two 
points in this letter which per­
tain to Delta Skull.
Point one made by R. D. T. con­
cerned men who were lacking the 
necessary factor to be in Delta 
Skull. As is stated in Article II, 
Part I, of the constitution of Delta 
Skull: “A man must be a junior 
in good standing with an average 
factor of not less than 1.75 to be­
come a member of the Delta Skull 
society.” This prerequisite has 
been met by all of the members 
of Delta Skull.
Point three made by R. D. T. 
concerned the membership of Joe 
Nutter and Bob Straka in Delta 
Skull as well as ODK. Both Nut­
ter and Straka have fulfilled the 
requirements for membership in 
Delta Skull, and, as active mem­
bers in the junior class, were 
rightly chosen for membership in 
the junior honorary. When ODK 
was reactivated here, the faculty, 
members of ODK chose the pres­
ent chapter in complete accord­
ance with their constitution. Along 
with the senior, class members, 
Nutter and Straka were chosen for 
ODK because of their outstanding 
activity participation on Tech’s 
campus. Inasmuch as the member­
ship of neither Delta Skull nor 
ODK is up to full complement, the 
presence of these two men in bothrJ 
honoraries denies no eligible man

At a meeting with Dr. Warden 
on Friday, February 15, the mar­
ried veterans of Tech decided to 
elect a committee of eight mem­
bers whose job it will ibe to set 
up a priority system for the dis­
tribution of housing units which 
are to be built for Tech veterans. 
While the local Veterans’ Ad­
ministration has not been official­
ly notified by the government, it 
has learned through a Pittsburgh 
newspaper that twenty-five hous­
ing units for married veterans 
and approximately one hundred 
for single veterans will be con­
structed for Tech. A petition is 
being drawn up which will be 
sent to Mayor Lawrence request­
ing that these units be built with­
in the campus area. It was also 
decided that a tea will be given 
by the school for all wives of the 
veterans in the very near future. 
Its purpose is to enable the wives 
to become better acquainted with 
each other, and it is hoped that a 
club will be formed to further 
this end.
The meeting was also thrown 
open to suggestions for additional 
methods of solving the housing 
problem. Among these were the 
ideas that apartments over gar­
ages or large homes in the Shady- 
side and park areas be rented 
and that several large unoccupied 
houses within the vicinity of the 
campus be remodeled into apart­
ments. The Veterans Administra­
tion is open to all suggestions 
which students, or anyone, may 
have for solving their problem, 
nd Miss Bird in the Dean’s 
ffice is gladly accepting them. So 
students, come forth with your 
brainstorms and help to alleviate 
this housing situation.
The next meeting of the vet­
erans will be in two weeks, and 
U vets are urged to attend so 
hat this organization can be a 
tronger, more effective one.

As King Candidate
Delta Tau Delta in selecting 
their candidate for the King of 
Hearts has decided to pay homage 
to Carnegie Delts who have gone 
before them and who are now 
famous personages in their re­
spective fields.
The problem of selecting one 
out of many famous alumni was 
finally solved by the selection of 
Dr. R. H. Coo, (E’31), noted arch­
aeologist, zoologist, and explorer 
who, together with the Duke of 
Windsor, was selected in 1935 as 
Time Magazine’s Man of The 
Year. The accompanying snapshot 
of Dr. Coo was brought by a na­
tive runner from the Tanganyika 
Territory where the learned Doc­
tor is at present working on his 
newest treatise “The Sex Life of 
The Albino Giraffe.”
The Doctor will leave shortly 
for his native land and has prom­
ised to arrive in Pittsburgh in 
time for the Mortar Board Dance 
on the 23rd of this month.”

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1946THE OARNEGIE TARTAN5
TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Dick Heckman
Laugh-of-the-week, oddly enough comes from the higher-ups in 
the Athletic Dept. The reason why the basketball squad didn’t go to 
Penn State last week for their scheduled game with the Lions was 
given as, due to the strike, it would be impossible to get transportation. 
It’s a laugh in one respect and is really sad in another. A laugh be­
cause everyone knows the taxis, buses’ and trains were all running, 
and sad because it’s too bad that a college athletic Dept, won’t knock 
itself out to give the boys a chance '
INTRAMURAL Tech Basketeers Win 
ROUND-UP
to go on the trip they would rather 
make than any other. There must 
have been other reasons, because 
I don’t think the Athletic Dept, is 
cheap enough to give the guys a 
raw deal like that, but as yet I 
have to hear them. If there are, 
my apologies—if there aren’t, a 
loud bronx cheer to those respon­
sible.
Lew Heiles—Number 11
Continuing the policy started a 
couple of weeks ago, but discon­
tinued for reasons unknown, of 
presenting the life and loves of the 
gang who’s out there on the bas­
ketball court for us, we give you 
New Kensington’s Pride and Joy, 
Lew Heiles (No. 11 to you). Lew, 
apparently from his present ap­
pearance, was born and raised. 
He wasn’t raised too far, however, 
and remains one of the shorter 
members of the current quintet. 
Besides plowing around a basket­
ball court, Lew is a hot man 
around first base in the baseball 
season. Lew was the main factor 
in Tech’s successes in the early 
part of the campaign because of 
his stellar play in setting up the 
Tech offense and, at the same 
time, protecting against oppon­
ents’ fast breaks. In fact, one of 
the biggest compliments I have 
ever heard came from one of the 
rivals’ benches when one of the 
opposing players remarked, “ft 
that No. 11 weren’t out there, Tech 
wouldn’t even be in the ball 
game.” Lew, because of his ag­
gressiveness, often gets on the op­
position’s nerves and, human na­
ture being what it is, Lew has his 
little paw in some arguments. Be­
lieve me, he doesn’t mean any 
harm, he’s just the victim of cir­
cumstances. Lew’s latest creation 
for providing the crowd with a 
laugh came Saturday night when 
Lew was guarding Donaldson of 
Allegheny. With Donaldson 
streaking down the court and Lew, 
tired as he was, plodding along 
behind, the Solid One decided the 
Allegheny captain was going to get 
away from him if he didn’t do 
something in a hurry. There were 
only two possibilities: Either
speed Lew up or slow Donaldson 
down. The first was definitely out. 
so Lew reaches out and gives Don­
aldson a loving tug at the belt. 
An engineer’s ingenuity! By way 
oi the habits of our hero, Lew’s 
nose has a habit of running when­
ever Lew runs too much (co-or­
dination), and it’s not uncommon, 
when the ref blows the whistle 
and tells Lew he’s not playing ac­
cording to the rules, to see Lew 
make no response except a large 
sniff. Enough of this love-mak­
ing, but keep your eye on No. 11, 
he can really chuck that aggate 
around.
Everybody’s hollering about our 
lack of school spirit. This is to 
infoim those present that there is 
at least one person around who 
cheeis himself hoarse. Vince 
Benys lost his voice completely 
following one of Al’s cheers the 
other night.
Administration Take Notice—All 
Is Not Serene on Tech Campus
Ever since last fell, when every­
body was wondering where Tech’s 
football team was, the Adminis­
tration has been promising things. 
First, it was a coach, then a team. 
So far, here it is spring and where 
are we? No coach, no team! It is 
this person’s opinion that a foot­
ball team cannot be started from 
scratch without a spring practice. 
How can any coach, no matter who 
he is, be expected to take an en­
tirely new squad at the beginning 
of October and make a football 
team out of it in tw'o or three 
weeks? Are we going to have a 
spring practice or aren’t we? It is 
our opinion that this situation at 
least calls for some kind of state­
ment from the Athletic Depart­
ment on the subject so that we can 
find .out just where the student 
body stands and know what to 
expect.
While we’re on the subject, we 
might as well get the rest of it 
off our minds. It’s got to come 
sometime, it might as well be now. 
All the while the search for a foot­
ball coach has been going on, it 
has been rumored that Tech is 
looking for a combination football 
and basketball coach. In case the 
faculty doesn’t know it, here is 
the opinion of all of the students 
we have talked to on the subject 
—They think the idea of a com­
bination coach is definitely high- 
school stuff. They think if Car­
negie Tech hasn’t the money to 
spend on two different coaches, it 
is probably the only way out, but 
if Tech can stand the financial 
¦“strain” two coaches is the only 
thing to get unless we are going 
to be babies and be Scotch about 
the whole affair. They feel that 
Tech’s athletics have dwindled far 
enough without having to make 
the boys play under a mediocre 
coach in the two sports, rather 
than having the benefits of learn­
ing from two good coaches.
While we’re on the subject of 
being Scotch, most of the higher- 
ups in the educational field will 
admit that extra-curricular ac­
tivities, including sports, are a
vital part of anyone's education. 
Here at Tech, are we supposed to 
have enough educational facili­
ties to make up for a lack of 
athletic facilities? Oh, our facili­
ties are fine. Yeah, yeah. Here are 
a few examples:
1. The soccer team all had; the 
same size pants (No. 40) and; they 
weren’t soccer pants at that! The 
guys were swimming in them all 
season. The shirts were infested 
with the moths of ten years. They 
got one new ball all season and 
that was so cheap that it went all 
out of shape during the first game. 
There weren’t any nets in the 
goals, thus even violating the rules 
of the game.
2. When the boys went to prac­
tice intramural basketball they go 
to the towel room and ask for a 
ball. After filling out the neces­
sary red tape, what do they get? 
A ball that isn’t even made out 
of leather. It’s about twice as 
heavy as a regulation ball and has 
patches all over tye circumfer­
ence. Great!
3. The swimming team doesn’t 
even get paidi officials for their 
meets. The “officials” are compos­
ed of any willing observer who 
meet the following standards: 1. 
They are present. 2. They have 
seen a swimming meet before.
4. The basketball suits, which 
used to be cleaned fairly regular­
ly, have now gotten to the state 
where the Lifebuoy advertisement 
wouldn’t even have them.
The teams report that almost 
every team they have been oppos­
ing (and for the most part, they 
have been smaller colleges) have 
invariably had better equipment 
in the sport which they partici­
pated in.
All of this can probably be ex­
plained by the overlords, but as 
a few representatives of the stu­
dent body, we’d like to see the 
administration’s reply to the foot­
ball predicament so we all know 
where the situation stands. That’s 
all we want—information. We’ll 
hold this place open for the revel­
ation.
Intramural bowling took the 
spotlight last week as twelve 
teams took to the maple lanes in 
search of the campus ten pin 
championship.
Though early predictions have 
been known to go wrong before, 
from Saturday’s games it looks 
like the DU’s and Phi Kaps are 
the best in league I. The Beta 
Sigs, paced by Norm Larson and 
Stan Kohn appeared to be the 
team_.to beat in the other league, 
but the PiKA’s and possibly the 
TX’s show potentialities.
The Tau Delts and SAE’s failed 
to show any reason why they 
entered the competition. With one 
man not even breaking eighty 
the Tau Delts were lucky to walk 
away with two games to their 
credit. The SAE’s gained one of 
the cheapest victories the big pins 
have ever seen when they gar­
nered 566 points to nose out the 
Tau Delts who trailed by a mere 
hundred points.
Scobell Hall got off to a fly­
ing start when they toppled 786 
points worth of pins, but the 
playoff of a second game tie and 
a 754 count in the final game gave 
the Phi Kaps a two-to-one edge 
for the series. With the second 
game deadlocked at 701 anchor­
man Paul Kuzma rolled a one- 
frame 27 to give the Phi Kaps 
their margin of victory. The 
D.U.’s after taking the first two 
by more than a hundred points 
slipped in the final game and saw 
a last frame spare give the Zeta’s 
a victory by the slim margin of 
seven points.
Over in league II the PiKA’s 
came through with the only 
white-wash of the day when they 
rolled over Welch Hall for three 
straight. Theta Xi came through 
after a slow start to capture the 
last two games of their series with 
the Citcom Clan.
The Beta Sigs stole the show 
despite the loss of their first game 
to the Delts. Beta Sigma Rho’s 
Norm Larson had the one-game 
high score with 231. Stan Kohn’s 
total of 574 was tops for three 
games. The team’s total of 2257 
was also unmatched.
Basketball started last night 
with eight teams taking to the 
floor. Tonight it will be Delta 
Upsilon against the independent 
TNT’s and Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
against the class section 7-B. Both 
games are at seven.
All Points Trophy 
System Explained
To all you poor creatures who 
have any interest at the present 
time in the Tech all points trophy, 
with the exception of the Beta’s 
who at the present time are way 
out in front in the quest, the Tar­
tan humbly presents a few side 
slants. The trophy is a rather 
massive affair which any organ­
ization on the Tech campus would 
be happy to have sitting on its 
mantle piece. At the present time 
there are only three names grac­
ing the sides of same, two of 
which are fraternity, the other, 
the Cit-Com. Those fraternities 
are the Delta Upsilon and the Pi 
Kappa Alpha. Each winner of the 
trophy has the honor of having 
its noble name inscribed on a 
small name plate which is located 
on the side, and the year in which 
it was won.
This trophy is not to be retired 
by a team which wins it for three 
years but rather will be perpetu­
ated throughout the years.

Second From Allegheny
Marck, Watson Spark Tartan Victory
Reconversion set in at Tech last Saturday as George Marck re­
turned to the old Alma Mater to spark the Tartans to their second win 
of the season over Allegheny College, 51-48. Marck, who rejoined an 
old team-mate, George Meyer, to instill into the team some of the old 
fire of “Maxie’s Boys” was nothing short of sensational. He and Meyer, 
together with Lew Heiles and Bernie Watson, made the Tech five look 
like a pre-war aggregation in spots.
Marck Starts Scoring for Tech
The game started (they usually 
do) with Tech getting off fast as 
Marck dropped through a long set 
shot. Joe Harmuth added a foul 
throw and Marck came right back 
with another long swish. Alle­
gheny was dumbfounded as Meyer 
and Marck tossed the aggate 
around like a baseball. This 
wasn’t the same ball club which 
had nosed them out earlier in the 
season, mostly on Gene Hannum’s 
20 points. The Carnegie fans, too, 
noticed that these two guys had 
played together before. Allegheny 
took time out and changed their 
defense from the zone to a man- 
for-man. Andres got the visitors 
their first field goal with a one- 
hand job from the foul circle and 
Donaldson added a free throw.
But Marck was still on the floor 
and bounced a pass in to Harmuth 
under the hoop for two more. 
Howie Levy then stole a pass from 
the Gators and fired it to Harmuth 
—swish, and Tech had a 9-3 lead. 
It was 11-4 when Marck put on a 
dribbling exhibition to go all the 
way in alone and drop another 
through the hoop. Allegheny then 
put together five straight points 
on three fouls and a field goal by 
Donaldson (Lew Heiles’ buddy, 
oh, yeah) before Marck came 
through again with his dribbling 
finesse to duplicate his earlier feat 
and give the home club a 15-9 
lead at the quarter.
The second stanza saw the two 
teams pour 36 points through the 
bucket, with Allegheny getting 
90% of the rebounds. On the floor 
itself, Tech was a better ball club, 
but the boys from Meadeville 
snatched the ball continually from 
the boards. It was during this 
quarter that big Paul Kuzma, 
Tech’s ace back-board hawk was 
sadly missed. He was on the 
bench for reasons known but to 
“de Lawd.” Allegheny continued 
chopping down the margin and 
finally caught the Skibos at 19-19 
midway in the period. Bernie 
Watson put the locals back into 
the fore again by sinking the first 
two of his total of 14 points and 
Levy intercepted another Gator 
pass and turned it into two more. 
After Allegheny had scored twice, 
Marck did it again and beat the 
visitors’ defense for a lay-up. 
Levy again broke up a play and 
fired a pass to Watson for a lay-up 
while Kirkpatrick kept Allegheny 
in the game with a pair of goals. 
Watson popped one through from 
the corner, but MacMillan came 
right back for Allegheny. Levy 
dropped another pop shot through 
the hoop as the gun sounded, and 
Tech walked off the floor with a 
32-28 lead.
The Tartans started out in earn­
est again at the outset of the sec­
ond half. Watson took a nice pass 
from Marck on a fast break to 
add two to the cause. After Wig- 
ton added a free toss for Alle­
gheny, Levy and Wigton added 
successive twin counters for their 
respective teams. Tech built up 
a ten-point lead as Watson and 
Marck came through with field 
goals and Watson added a foul. 
Andres swished one for Allegheny, 
and Watson, who played himself a 
whale of a ball game, got loose to 
score a sensational shot from close- 
up. Allegheny then went on a 
rampage as Andres dumped in two 
more and Wigton dropped two 
fouls. Heiles and Marty Chetlin 
tried to stave off the oncoming 
Gators with twin counters, but the 
visitors roared up to within four 
points of the Techjtes at the end 
of the third stanza.
The fourth quarter was a wild 
affair which more resembled foot­
ball than basketball. The two 
teams could’ collect only one field 
goal between them and totaled
only nine points for the period. 
Nevertheless, the whole thin5 had 
plenty of action. Heiles end Wat­
son were the yeomen under the 
boards for Tech, fighting the tall r 
visitors to a standstill in the fi t 
for rebounds. Joe Harmuth <-ot 
himself tangled up with the Ca ; ; 
three times in a row and was ¦ * - 
sented with three foul tries, tv/n o! 
which he made good. Beck ft ' % 
one-pointer for Allegheny jus V - j 
fore Heiles and Donaldson t
came to blows. Oddly enough, t 
was Heiles who was awarded t’ o 
free try, which he made good. 
Allegheny fought back with f' Mi- 
straight points and held Tech e\ en 
to bring the score to 51-48 with a 
minute to go. The court became 
the scene of quite a battle for the 
ball which once saw three mem­
bers of each team on the floor at 
once in a mad rush for the sphere. 
Time ran out, though and the score 
stood just where it was.
Sidelights on the Game:
Kuzma was missing from the 
bench during the second half. 
Reason? He handed in his resig­
nation during the course of the 
first half. Incidently, he was fol­
lowed by C. T. Butler in the 
“turning in the uniforms dept.” 
who also decided that his services 
were no longer wanted.
Marck is the only guy we’ve 
ever seen who can dribble with 
one hand while directing proceed­
ings with the other.
Meyer Steadying Hand
Meyer is definitely a good man 
to have around when the going 
gets rough, or any other time for 
that matter. The big guy was a 
big influence in holding the wild 
Tech five together in the last 
period and deserves a large hunk 
of credit for the win.
For the first time this season, 
the Tartans made a goodly per­
centage of their fouls. They capi­
talized nine times out of 12. Alle­
gheny could do no better than 14 
for 24.

What has Bill Sherb got that 
gets ’em (or someone else got 
that doesn’t)? Bill has been coach­
ing the Jayvee basketball team 
now for a couple of months and 
from the looks of things, will 
soon field a team that can give the 
varsity a trimming. The latest 
developments on Tech’s up and 
coming J.V. is that C. T. Butler 
and Paul Kuzma have quit the 
varsity and are coming into the 
Sherb fold. They join Stan Kohn, 
regular guard in the early part of 
the season, who got off the band­
wagon some time ago. This means 
Bill can now field a team com­
posed of three mid-season Varsity 
regulars and rumor has it that 
another is on the way. It must be 
Bill’s Wildroot Cream Oil.
Incidently, the Jayvees dispelled 
the rumor that they were no 
better than Intramural teams by 
thumping the Tau Delts as a pre­
liminary to the Allegheny game 
last Saturday night.
With the Jayvees in the position 
they’re in now, there’s no doubt 
that if they could play the first 
half of their schedule again, it 
might be a different story.

Critical Temperature
Night Must Fall, by Emlyn Wil­
liams, is a real melodrama, or,' in 
the fashionable term, a “psycho­
logical thriller.” Although you can 
be fairly sure who done it before 
the play is well under way, the 
suspense—and what a suspense!— 
comgs from wondering what on 
earth is going to happen next. Of 
course if you have seen the play 
before, or the movie that was 
made from it, you will remember 
the ending, but we have a nickel 
that says ycu will enjoy seeing it 
over again at the Little Theater 
anyhow. It is a good production 
of a good show, and if this type of 
play is the sort ff thing you go 
for, you shouldn’t miss it.
For those uninitiates who, like
Dr. Hunter Talks 
To Tekiion Club
The Teknon Club will hold its 
first dinner meeting of the new 
semester at six o’clock, Wednes­
day, Feb. 20, 1946, in the Shady7 
side Presbyterian Church on Am- 
berson Avenue.
Teknon is the oldest religious 
organization at Carnegie Tech, 
(the organizer of the Young Men’s 
and Young Women’s Christian As­
sociations, and of the student 
chapel services on campus.) The 
group has been sponsored since its 
organization, by Dr. Hugh Kerr, 
and the members of the Shadyside 
Church, who provide dinner with­
out charge for the young people 
each Wednesday evening before 
their discussion begins. Dr. Lloyd 
Hunter, of the Westinghouse Re­
search Laboratories, is the current 
discussion leader. The young peo­
ple feel that Dr. Hunter, as a tech­
nical man, is a particularly able 
person to help the students at a 
technical school solve their re­
ligious problems. Teknon holds 
a joint meeting about once a 
month with a similar group at the 
University of Pittsburgh known as 
the Pitkin Club. All the new stu­
dents on Tech campus are cor­
dially invited to attend these meet­
ings and join in the discussion.
In order that the church may 
know how many people for whom 
to prepare, those planning to at­
tend meetings are asked to sign 
the list in Skibo, Maggy Murph, 
Industries Hall, or the Fine Arts 
Building by four o’clock Monday 
afternoon.
The discussion on the meeting of 
February 27th will revolve around 
the theme of religious discussion 
week. Teknon is open to, and wel­
comes, young people of any faith.
us^ didn’t see the movie, Night 
Must Fall takes place in a lonely 
English country cottage, where a 
destitute, rather mysterious, young 
lady takes care of her shrewish 
old aunt. A brash and even more 
mysterious young man is intro­
duced into the household through 
the servant girl, who is about to 
have a baby. The play develops 
into an opposition of wills between 
the young lady and the fellow, and 
wondering which one is going to 
win keeps you on the edge of your 
seat until the very end. Of course 
we shouldn’t forget to mention 
that both of the leading characters 
have very strange mental quirks, 
to put it mildly, and this makes 
their actions rather unpredictable.
The performances in the current 
production are uniformly excel­
lent. Ray Boyle’s sensitive por­
trayal of Dan, the young fellow of 
many complexes, was something 
to be remembered. We felt that he 
overacted a bit in a few places, 
but that can hardly be avoided in 
such a show. The old lady, a char­
acter that could easily become 
stereotyped, was living and con­
vincing in the capable hands of 
Nancy Wickwire. Mary Elizabeth 
Kane, is a servant part with real 
meat on it, managed1 not only to 
be different from the other faithful 
servants that the Drama Depart­
ment has offered us through the 
years (usually so painfully alike), 
but also nearly to steal the show. 
Marilyn Bloom used all her skill 
to make the young niece and her 
confused feelings towards Dan be­
lievable. William Ross put in an 
amusing bit as the “unmitigated 
bore” who wants to marry her, 
and so did Joanne Thomas as the 
not-quite-human district nurse. 
Roger Brann seemed to have come 
down from Scotland Yard espec­
ially for this show, and—without 
being insulting — Judy Lambert 
was perfectly natural as the sim­
ple-minded maid. The cast spoke 
with a variety of English dialects, 
none of which, we have a suspic­
ion; wrere perfectly authentic, but 
which served their purpose of 
making the atmosphere more Eng­
lish. The setting, designed by Wil­
liam Lockey, contributed greatly 
to the effect.
Night Must Fall is not, in our 
opinion, one of those shows that 
will be remembered in future 
years by the Drama Dept, as high 
points in its career, but it is a good 
play, worth while seeing.

Traditional Tea Dance
On Wednesday, February 27th 
from four to six p. m., Student

Thistle Hall. This dance was a 
pre-war custom and like many 
other campus traditions is being 
revived.
Tech’s Bob Kelly and his orches­
tra will supply the music. Since 
tickets are only twenty-five cents, 
every student on the campus can 
be there.

FRAT FLASHES
There were hearts and no flow­
ers this past week-end with the 
Star Dust Swing and the basket­
ball game, but have no fear, at 
this rate we’ll have trailing ar­
butus trailing the mountain sides 
in no time flat. Just have faith 
and stick with the fraternities on 
campus—they’ll provide the fun.
Wednesday evening, February 
13, the Chi O’s held their pledg­
ing ceremony in the Black Cat. 
Later the girls had a sea food 
dinner at Schulberg’s in honor 
of the pledges.
The Theta mothers held a 
luncheon for the girls at the 
Union Saturday, February 16. A 
few of the dorm students had 
their mothers in especially for the 
occasion. The girls provided the 
entertainment with Theta Songs. 
Sunday, February 17, the pledg­
ing ceremony took place at Boo 
Girts’ home.
Following the pledging cere­
mony Wednesday, February 13, 
the D.G.’s gave a dinner for the 
new pledges at Kahn’s.
It seems that the Theta Xi’s 
have found stuff that they never 
knew existed at Linden Half 
sooooo they have invaded the 
place. (We’re all for keeping the 
fraternity pins on campus.)
After the Basketball game Sat­
urday night, the PiKA’s had a 
Record Dance at the house. The 
valentine theme was even carried 
into the refreshments — candy 
hearts, etc.
Sunday, February 17, at the 
Initiation ceremony, Sam Moses 
became a Tau Delt brother. (Con­
gratulations, Sam!)
Congratulations are also in or­
der for Ken Whitmoyer who be­
came a Beta brother Sunday af­
ternoon. Saturday night the Beta’s 
had a Valentine Rushing party at 
the house. It seems that the red 
lighting in the house startled the 
motley crowd.
More Congratulations—this time 
to Corkey Dunn who was initiated 
into the Beta Sigs Sunday morn­
ing. On Saturday, after the Bas­
ketball game, the Beta Sig’s held 
a house dance in celebration of 
Valentine’s Day.
Saturday night after the Bas­
ketball game, some of the Delts 
from Allegheny joined in the fun 
at the Delt house.
The Phi Kapp’s held old home 
week at their house dance Sat­
urday night. A few of the former 
Phi Kapp’s returned on furlough 
to make it a real reunion.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN7
Letters
[continued from page 2]
the honor of being a member.
In view of these facts, which 
R. D. T. obviously did not con­
sider, we feel that his recommen­
dation concerning Delta Skull are 
impertinent.
THE DELTA SKULL 
HONORARY.
SCIMITAR REPLIES
“To criticize is far easier than 
to originate, to tear down far 
simpler than to construct.” The 
preceding quotation is taken from 
the February 12 issue of the 
Tartan. It is taken from a letter 
that pointed out “several dis­
crepancies and inequalities” in 
the choosing of men for Scimitars, 
a sophomore activities honorary. 
Before any accusations were 
made, the writer should have 
made a more careful study of the 
facts involved.
1. It is true that the Scimitars 
had in their organization one 
man who did not fulfill the 
factor requirements necessary 
for admittance. This was not 
found out until the meeting of 
February 11, the second meet­
ing of the Scimitars. At this 
time it was voted that the 
man in question tender his 
resignation. The error was 
due to the points committee, 
operating under Student
Interhonorary Council 
Sponsors Date Bureau
A Date Bureau sponsored by 
Interhonorary Council will be es­
tablished to help new students on 
campus get dates for the King of 
Hearts dance, February 23, to be 
held in the Men’s Gym. Lou Um- 
bach and Imogene Grove are tak­
ing charge of Bureau. Dates may 
be secured either by registering at 
the ticket table in Skibo or by 
contacting Lou Umbach or Imo­
gene Grove.
The Date Bureau for the Star­
dust Swing proved very success­
ful. Although not many requests 
were made, those that came in 
were filled to comply with prefer­
ences as made known by the men 
who asked for dates. Strangely 
enough, there was an over-supply 
of girls. This service was spon­
sored mainly for the convenience 
of the new students on the cam­
pus who haven’t had the oppor­
tunity to meet all the beautiful 
co-eds. What’s holding you back, 
fellows? Here’s your big chance!
Council and not to the Scimi­
tars.
2. The writer of the letter states 
that a majority of the men se­
lected are members of two 
fraternities. To my knowledge, 
the men were chosen on the 
basis of their personal quali­
fications, and not in considera­
tion of their fraternity affiilia- 
tion. To have accomplished 
the coup suggested would have 
required the sheerest brass 
imaginable, and no group in 
Student Council would at­
tempt anything of the sort.
3. The accusation that Scimitar 
has been known to cheat on 
an examination is so childish 
that I will not even attempt 
an explanation of this “Holier 
than thou” phenomena.
4. According to the Constitution, 
the president is chosen on the 
basis of number of points. Be­
cause of the conditions which 
have prevailed at Tech during 
the past three years, there is 
no one in the Scimitars who 
can qualify. Instead, the pres­
ident was nominated and 
elected on the same basis as 
the president of any organiza­
tion.
5. None of the Scimitars need­
ed a special petition. When the 
notices of the men eligible for 
Scimitar were posted, it was 
clearly stated at the bottom, 
and not in fine print, that any 
man who felt he should have 
been included on the list was 
free to add his name and be 
processed, as were the others, 
through the Points Committee. 
No special petition was nec­
essary for a man to be consid­
ered.
Such statements as appeared in 
R. D. T.’s letter to the Tartan in­
dicates the “careful” research that 
must have gone into its composi­
tion.
Emil Prieto, 
President, Scimitars.
TO THE DEFENSE
After reading the letter written 
by R.D.T. in the last Tartan issue 
about the somewhat undistin­
guished status of many members 
of the reactivated sophomore and 
Junior honoraries, Scimitars and 
Delta Skull, I also have analyzed 
the situation, which may prove 
interesting to other Techites.
Throughout the fall semester, 
the Men’s Point Committee of 
Student Council spent consider­
able time and effort organizing a 
very complete and fair men’s 
point system based on activities 
and scholarship from which the 
eligibility for membership into 
Scimitar and Delta Skull was to 
be determined, replacing the 
purely political considerations of 
the past. Two student council 
meetings after this system had 
been approved by council, Mr. 
Binder, Chairman of the Men’s 
Point System Committee, per­
suaded council to pass his motion 
that the point requirements for 
eligibility into the two honor­
aries be omitted in their reacti­
vation and that, in their place, 
the Men’s Point Committee draw 
up a list of those eligible to be 
displayed on the buletin board 
and to be voted upon by Student 
Council. This, in effect, made the 
wonderful points system utterly 
worthless since it left the choos­
ing of those eligible to the po­
litical whims of the Men’s Point 
Committee.
To show how well the commit­
tee took advantage of its position 
I present the case to you. First, 
it posted a list of the men which 
it considered and desired. Anyone 
who wished to question the eligi­
bility of those listed could do so. 
NO one dared, since he would 
only jeopardize his own possibili­
ties of being recommended by 
the committeemen, you under­
stand. Consequently, this left only 
the names which the committee 
had selected, and council, since 
it is largely composed of girls 
who know little about man’s ac­
tivities or about the fellows who 
are in them, readily elected all 
which the points committee rec­
ommended.
As a result, the “honoraries” 
are composed of the fellowing: 
from a total of twenty-six mem­
bers for both honoraries, there 
are nine men from the fraternity 
of the Chairman of the Men’s 
Point System and six from the 
fraternity of another Student 
Council member. Several of these 
men have no more than two ac­
tivities. Together, they add up to 
more than half the total member­
ship of the honoraries! Add to 
this situation the fact that two of 
the men elected to Delta Skull by 
Student Council are members of 
Student Council, as well as mem­
bers of the senior honorary, ODK. 
Furthermore, two other men do 
not have the necessary factor re­
quirements, while a third isn’t 
registered this semester. Here is 
a masterpiece of politics mixed 
with a maximum of oversight.
May I recommend to interested
Tech men that they had better 
keep closer watch over their 
elected representatives to prevent 
further, occurrences of this sort. 
To the feminine members of Stu­
dent Council, I suggest that you 
be more questioning about tHe 
information which your trusted 
co-workers give you.
Sincerely,
‘A Poor Loser”

capable P. & D. Senior, who is

visual techniques for the Tech-

startling, intending to convey 
stronger impression through the

As an afterthought, perhaps 
some credit for the Technical’s 
success should go to the edito­
rial staff. Under the capable edit­
orship of Julia Randall, these 
busy beavers have to dig up the 
articles, decide upon their suit­
ability, and plan the magazine. 
It is their hard work, plus the 
labor of their predecessors, that 
has made it an honor to have an

Student Council Holds 
Frosh Mixer Dance
On February 22, the Student 
Council will sponsor a Freshman 
Mixer for all engineer fresh­
men, and veterans. It will be held 
from 9:00 to 1:00 in Thistle Hall. 
This dance, which will be a juke 
box affair, will have members of 
the Mortar Board, the senior 
class, and the members of the 
Cwens, as hostesses. The hard 
work of the Student Council, plus 
the redecorated Thistle Hall, will 
certainly insure a successful 
evening.
Correction
An unfortunate omission occur­
red in a recent issue of the Tar­
tan. In the article concerning the 
explosive research program be­
ing conducted by the Physics De­
partment, the name of the Asso­
ciate Professor of Physics, Dr. E. 
M. Pugh, was omitted. Dr. Pugh 
is responsible for the present op­
eration of that program and is in 
charge of the entire project.
Power Strike 
Affects Tech
Have you noticed any of your 
fellow students wandering around 
the campus with bloody stumps 
where their feet used to be? This 
unfortunate situation is not due to 
any of the more common reasons 
which wear people’s feet down to 
their ankles. You can blame it on 
the power strike, although not en­
tirely. The garagemen of the 
Pittsburgh Motor Coach Co. did 
not help matters any when they 
went out on strike and refused to 
let any of the buses operate. At 
any rate, the worn and abused 
feet of many people are due to the 
exceptionally long hikes which 
Tech students, perforce, so enthu­
siastically joined.
I did not realize that the Tech 
campus was so crammed with 
eager beavers. When all means of 
transportation failed, Tech stu­
dents walked to school. Yes, they 
actually did! One girl walked to 
Carrick (She now expects to get 
an A in all the courses for which 
she had class that day.) People 
who walked to places such as Car­
rick or Mt. Lebanon sustained the 
severe injuries mentioned above. 
Fallen arches fell to students who 
walked only to Wijkinsburg.
Other eager beavers included the 
student who resurrected his old 
bicycle, the ones who took taxis, 
and the other ones who scouted for 
hours to find a ride or hitch-hiked. 
The strike proved that almost fifty 
per cent of the students at Tech 
have their hearts in the wrork (or 
have already overcut their 
classes).
The strike principally affected 
transportation. It was also ex­
pected to affect street and home 
lighting, but this threat material­
ized for a few minutes only at 
Tech. Two people, however, were 
hurt in the rush by fraternities 
trying to organize parties for Tues­
day night.
The strike had another effect on 
the Carnegie Tech campus. When 
the electricity was turned off, the 
clocks in the Skibo were stopped 
for a few minutes. Try as they 
will, the clocks have been unable 
to make up this time (just like the 
students) and are now slightly 
behind the times. This makes 
lunch hour in Skibo last one hour 
and five minutes instead of one 
hour, and the class afterward only 
forty-five minutes. Let’s have 
more of the same.
Incidentally, when your friends

Swimming Party To Be Held 
March 2 at Carnegie Gym
Conceding that the Valentine 
Party given by Evening Student 
Council was a pleasant success 
and all that attended had a grand 
time, the Social Chairman and 
his committee are looking for­
ward to the Swimming Party to 
be held in the Tech Gymnasium 
swimming pool, Saturday, March
2, 1946. This affair usually at­
tracts a large crowd and those 
students that have attended one 
of these swimming parties in the 
past know that it means a lot of 
lun. The pool is large eonugh so 
that any type of water game can 
be played without cramping the 
players style. A person doesn’t 
have to be a good swimmer, in 
fact he doesn’t have to swim at all 
to enjoy himself at this party for 
there is a shallow end to the 
pool that offers those who just 
want to splash around in the wa­
ter an opportunity to do so. The 
important thing to remember is 
that this party is another means 
of acquainting Evening Students 
with one another. There will be 
a lifeguard on hand to take care 
of any mishaps that may happen, 
so you see there just isn’t any 
excuse for not attending this 
party. Just to summarize: Inflate 
the old water wings, dig out the 
swim suit and make it your bus- 
ness to attend the Swimming 
Party to be held at the Gym, 
March 2, 1946. From 9 to 12. 
The price of admittance will be 
35c to be paid at the door.
Registration Data
The figures for the second se­
mester registration are slightly 
lower than those of the first se­
mester, but that is the general 
rule. Second semester registra­
tion, however, is proportionately 
higher than past second semester 
registrations have been even in 
years previous to the war. Here 
are this semester's figures as of 
February 15, 1946. There are 514 
registered in Engineering which 
is a gain of 12 over last semester’s 
number. Arts has 321—a drop of 
exactly 70. Margaret Morrison 
shows an increase of 7 with a 
total of 71 for this semester. But 
Gene al Studies took a decided 
drop from 117 to 73. The total 
for this semester is 979, while 
that of last semester was 1074, a 
general decrease of 95. Included 
in this semester’s registration are 
242 veterans. All things consid­
ered, we believe the registration 
is fair.
Interviewing
Hello fellow evening student! 
Hope you are all feeling as fit as a 
fiddle and ready to be introduced 
to a very lovely person here on 
campus. Of course I know you 
are, so shine the spotlight over 
this direction boys on Miss Jean 
M. Grimes. A very pretty picture 
she makes too, with those big 
laughing blue eyes, light brown 
hair, 5 feet 4 inches of height and 
] )2 of pounds.
Jean tells us this is her second 
semester at Tech, taking Business 
Law II. Well! Now we know we 
can consult whenever we have 
any legal problems to be solved.
This evening student is em­
ployed right here on campus in 
the Controller’s office, which 
makes it very convenient for her 
to attend her class in the evening. 
She is a graduate of Holy Rosary 
High School, and hails from Wil- 
kinsburg. Her telephone number 
as I understand it, are all the 
same numbers, which makes it 
very easy to remember. How 
about it B—?
Heading her list of entertain­

Who was the young gentleman 
waiting for an attractive young 
lady over at the Art School Fri­
day evening? And why was she 
in her “Sunday best?” Some fel­
lows have all the luck—eh, Nancy? 
... A few of the crowd at the 
Valentine Party at the Union not 
only enjoyed dancing, but even 
volunteered to wash and dry the 
dishes after the affair. I must say 
that some of the fellows dry dishes 
rather well—not even a dish was 
broken . . . Does anyone know 
of a novel poker game having been 
played recently for high (or low) 
stakes. Seen in the TARTAN’S 
Lost and Found Column was the 
following: Lost—one pair of
brown shorts and one blue skirt. 
We can understand how a person 
can lose a pair of gloves, but these 
other things, well . . . Another 
old timer has returned to the fold 
to finish his work. It was back in 
the year 1936 that Dave Werner 
first investigated that fact that 1 
tan2 o = ses2 0. Since then he 
had struggled along at Tech until 
the pressure of war work at the 
Pittsburgh Coal Company forced 
him to stop. He is now back with 
that old gleam of determination in 
his eye. Glad to see you again, 
Bud! . . . Bob Stock and Ginny 
were seen dancing cheek to cheek 
at the Valentine Party. They both 
must have the skin you love to 
touch . . . Steve and his wife 
were also there, but they didn’t 
stay long because they had worn 
themselves out hunting nylons. I 
wonder if they found any and if so 
where. Does anyone know the 
Marcinizyn’s telephone number?
. . . Major Stanton was there 
dancing with all the lovely girls. 
Incidently he has a lovely girl of 
his own ... It was with regret 
that we heard of the death of Ches 
Biscup’s sister. Accept our sym­
pathy, Ches . . .
I am practically exhausted and 
now I have to go out into the cold, 
cruel world. I read in the paper 
that the temperature would go 
down to five above and brother 
that’s cold in any man’s language. 
So shivering with this prospect in 
mind, I bid you goodnight.
terbug too. She just loves to swim, 
and I’m sure we can count on 
Jean to be present at the swim­
ming party we are holding in the 
very near future. Football and 
basketball prove to fascinate this 
Miss, and she attempts to be one 
of the spectators whenever possi­
ble. After her lunch each day, if 
time permits, Jean can usually be 
found playing bridge.
“I’m a great one for mixing 
names,” she states, “which some­
times proves embarrassing, es­
pecially when it comes to intro­
ducing people”. When it comes to 
food, just set a dish of baked 
ham in front of her, and you’ll be 
amazed at the satisfied expression 
which appears on her face.
Jean is just crazy about—yes, 
mail! The Naval Air Corps is 
tops with her, for she tells us her 
brother is in that branch of the 
service. That’s what we call sis­
terly love?
All of you who know Jean, 
have certainly been rewarded by 
her pleasing personality, and very 
attractive friendly smile. Glad to 
have you as one of us, Jean, and 
thank you for submitting to this 
interview.
Engineering 
Banquet Chair
Fred Vichich and his hearty 
laughter and friendly smile are 
old timers on the Tech campus. 
Among those who enroll as even­
ing students in the College of En­
gineering, there are comparative­
ly few who reach their ultimate 
goal of securing their degree. For 
ten years, Fred has been work­
ing toward this goal; this year he 
will receive his degree in Me­
chanical Engineering. He is now 
employed as a machine designer 
in the Transportation and Gen­
erator Division of Westinghouse 
Electric & Manufacturing Co., 
East Pittsburgh.
The interest shown by Fred in 
Evening School activities during 
the past three years has not been 
limited to one organization, for he 
is a member of Evening School 
Student Council; Phi Nu Frater­
nity; Nu Sigma Alpha, the honor­
ary mechanical fraternity; Secre­
tary of the College of Engineer­
ing; Chairman of the committee 
for the Engineers’ Banquet; and 
a very capable Plaid Staff mem­
ber.
Fred hails from Universal, 
Pennsylvania, and heartily de­
fends his home town in spite of 
the frequent jests he hears as to 
its size and whereabouts. He is 
the father of two children, a girl 
six and a boy four. It is quite a 
coincidence that upon the com­
pletion of Fred’s education, his 
young daughter will start hers. 
Let us hope that she will be as 
ambitious as her father.
For recreation, Fred likes to 
play golf and ball, but the diver­
sion which mostly interests him 
is just plain “gabbing.” Strangely 
enough, he is a good listener as 
well as a good talker.
Reflections
“Night Must Fall”—that is the 
title of the play by Emlyn Wil­
liams now being presented by the 
Department of Drama. Have you 
seen it? Well it is one of those 
“musts” everyone talks about. It 
will run until February 20 ^and 
you can secure your tickets by 
calling Mr. McKelway’s office 
Room 255, in the Administration 
Building. As you know, tickets are 
given to Evening School students. 
Stop in that office on your way to 
or from class, and get your ticket 
before the supply is depleted. We 
are sure that you will enjoy this 
play. The next production will be, 
“The Merchant of Yonkers” by 
Thornton Wilder, and will be pre­
sented in March.

[continued from page 7] 
from Pitt or Duquesne make re­
marks to the effect that they did 
not have to join in the great “Bat­
tle for Transportation,” tell them 
that you are glad to go to a good 
school where the administration is 
eager for one to learn all one pos­
sibly can to become a good en­
gineer or secretary. Tell them 
that your heart is in the work.

Editor’s Notes
We are gratefiil for the kind 
remarks which were written in 
the article “Letter to The Editor,” 
printed last week. Needless to 
say, we are proud of the five- 
column sheet. It does have that 
professional look. What are - we 
saying? It sounds as though we 
are “blowing our own horn” as it 
were. However this new make­
up means more and longer ar­
ticles and that means someone has 
to write them.
The aforementioned remarks 
are a build-up for the real pur­
pose of this article. Youknow 
what I mean. I am leading up to 
that old plea you have heard time 
and time again. Why don’t you 
come out and help us publish this 
paper. There is and old saying 
“if you can write a sentence, you 
can write a story.” It’s as simple 
as that. As one thing leads to an­
other, so does one sentence lead 
to another. And if you would 
come out and write a story for 
the PLAID, you would not only 
be helping out, but would have 
the satisfaction of seeing your 
creation in print.
This call for help has been 
made before, so please come out 
Friday evening to the PLAID.
Reflections
When it comes to throwing 
things, I don’t believe Irish con­
fetti has ever been thrown with 
as much finesse or vigor as was 
Mr. Harold Ickes’ letter of resig­
nation. One must admit that the 
Old Curmudgeon certainly took 
no backseat for anyone during his 
long tenure of office. But there 
was something about Harold that 
intrigued many people; his blunt­
ness of speech, his cutting humor, 
his biting sarcasm, his witty re­
marks, his complete indifference 
to the opinions of others, his 
scathing denunciations, and his 
tenaceous determination. All these 
plus his unquestionable honesty 
made him a character both color­
ful and unique. Many view his 
departure from the political scene 
with regret; for it was universally 
recognized that if there was any 
smoke, the Ick was certainly to 
pry and sniff around until some­
thing literally bit the nose and 
then, boy, did he love to pitch in­
to it. Yes, America needs an Ickes 
around if only to keep the public 
servants from feeling too smug 
and complacent; for goodness 
knows that many forget the real 
reason for their being in Wash­
ington.

... to be concluded
If you’ll be glad when Long Distance delays 
are ended . . . imagine our delight.
We’ve hated to ask you to wait, as necessary 
as it has been. And delays still occur on some 
crowded lines, particularly to the South and 
Far West.
But dawn is breaking. Soon we’ll have the 
facilities to take care of the increased demand 
for Long Distance service. We’re glad to be 
able to tell you this.
