Tech Swimmers Take Penn - Ohio Meet
swimming season in the history of 
the school.
The first Tartan victory of the 
day came in the. opening event as 
Norm Willock, Ken Daugherty, 
John Barlow and Ross Engleman 
won the 400 yard medley relay. 
In the backstroke leg of the relay, 
Willock was just out touched by» 
Slippery Rock’s Bolt. In the 
breaststroke leg, Ken Daugherty 
quickly took the lead and finished 
a body’s length (6’-6”) ahead of 
the Slippery Rock breasistroker. 
In the butterfly leg, John Barlow 
maintained the lead and matched 
Rodgers of Slippery Rock stroke 
for stroke. In the final freestyle 
leg, Ross Engleman lost the lead 
until the last 25 yards when he 
sprinted past McGinnis of Slip­
pery Rock and gave the Tartans 
the victory.
In the 220 yard freestyle the 
TartanS added six more points to 
their total as Pat Crecine took sec­
ond and Tony Chamay took sixth. 
Captain Mike Litch took a third 
in the 50 yard freestyle before the 
Tartan victory in the diving. Hal 
Pastrick who had stood sixth after 
the first seven dives put on a show 
of precision and coordination in 
the last five dives to easily win 
the event. Teammate Abby Davis 
finished a strong fourth.
In the 100 yard freestyle, the 
Tartans put on another show of 
strength as Mike Litch gained first 
place and teammate John Barlow 
finished fifth.
Team Depth 
Tech’s depth was revealed again 
in the 200 yard backstroke and 
the 440 yard freestyle as Norm

Relay Team 
Sets Record
Tech’s undefeated swimming 
team won its fourth Penn-Ohio 
championship and its first in ten 
years, at the Skibo pool last Sat­
urday. The Tartans scored 70 
points to finish ahead of Penn 46, 
Slippery Rock 44, Allegheny 29, 
Westminister 28, Grove City 23, 
and Case 21.
Tech put on a tremendous show 
of strength as they won four in­
dividual events and placed in 
every event with the exception of 
the 200 yard butterfly. It was the 
Tartan’s best team effort and it 
climaxed probably the finest

Sf&erulers Slip
E & S Jobs Decrease; 
Salaries Show Rise
For the past five years employment opportunities for en- 
g peering and science graduates have been spiraing upwards 
much to the pleasure of Tech E&S students. Now for the 
first time since 1950 the seniors are faced with an uncertain 
market fo rtheir talents acquired over the past four years.
In 1950 only 50% of the seniors 
had jobs at graduation time. This 
year, according to an estimate by 
Charles E. Wangeman, director of 
the Tech Bureau of Placements, 
the figure will stand at about 75%. 
Of 440 companies scheduled to in- 
teafiew at Carnegie in October 
omy 386 remain.
Business conditions which had 
been predicted to rise this month 
are not expected to show improve­
ment before mid-summer. This 
rise and the digging bound to oc­
cur when graduates find them­
selves out of work will probably 
result in 100% employment within 
three to four months after grad­
uation; “There is a potential need 
U\ all graduates,” Mr. Wange­
man asserted.
Mr. Wangemafi has recom­
mended strongly that seniors 
look to the lesser known firms 
for more likely offers, because 
now that the better known 
and bigger firms are doing less 
recruiting offers from these 
smaller firms will grow in im-

iHustrated Lecture 
To Be Presented 
By Tech Forum
Next Tuesday evening, March
11, the Tech Community Forum 
will sponsor the last of its 1957- 
58 programs.
Professor Robert Taylor of 
Tosh’s architecture department, 
wm speak at’7:30 p.m. in the S.I.A. 
Auditorium, on the topic, “A Look 
at Contemporary Architecture” at 
7:30. Using slides for illustration, 
he will comment on the general 
state of urban architecture in this 
country, with examples of both 
good and bad. He plans to give 
particular attention to problems 
of college and campus architec­
ture.
frofessor Taylor received bach­
’s and master of fine arts de­
gress from Princeton University. 
In addition to teaching at Tcch, he 
is a practicing architect in Pitts­
burgh with Curry, Martin and 
Taylor.
The Tech Community Forum is 
sponsored by the Carnegie Chap­
ter of the American Association of 
University Professors. Programs 
are open to faculty, students and 
trj£ general public. Following the 
lecture there will be a period of 
questions and discussion.

The sorority factors from the 
fall semester were released at the 
end of the last week. A survey 
reveals that six of the seven sor­
orities are above the all-school 
average of 2.374.
The pledge factors proved not 
to be as high with only four sor­
orities above the all-school aver­
age. It must be taken into consid­
eration, however, that the pledge 
classes vary considerably, i.e., 
from two to eight members.

development was controlled by 
survival of the fittest? These

MG Open House 
Climaxes Weekend
Next Sunday March 9, More- 
wood Gardens dormitory will hold 
its annual Open House from two 
to five o’clock. Everyone is in­
vited to visit all the floors, dormi­
tory rooms, recreation room, li­
brary and the other facilities. In 
previous years, the Open House 
was during Homecoming but due 
to the “flu” epidemic last fall, 
Dormitory Council set the date for 
Greek Sing week-end.
The contest for the four best 
decorated rooms, one in each of 
the towers, will be judged from 
1:00 to 2:00 Sunday afternoon. 
The winer will be awarded 
prizes of $5 per roommate. Two 
rooms have been nominated on 
each of the floors for tower com­
petition. The judges this year are 
Mrs. Green, resident head of the 
dormitory; Mrs. Annis, hostess of 
Carnegie Union; and Miss Dodson, 
professor of home furnishings at 
Carnegie Tech.
Getsie Crowned 
Honorary Captain 
Of Pershing Rifles
The crowning of Denise Getsie 
as Queen and Honorary Captain 
climaxed the annual Pershing 
Rifles Dance. Denise, a junior m 
sociology, was crowned by Rita 
Menke, last year’s queen who has 
since become the honorary spon­
sor of the 5th PR regiment.
Master of Ceremonies Calvin 
Marlett presented Denise with a 
copy of her portrait which was 
entered into the regimental com­
petition. If Denise wins this, she 
will become a candidate for the 
national sponsorship.
Sergeant Bedy of the ROTC de­
partment was given honorary 
membership in the society after 
the new Queen presented the 
members of the pledge class with 
their fourrageres. Colonel Fee- 
man, the PMST, congratulated the 
Queen and the members of the 
pledge class.

theater, university stock, children’s

and off Broadway productions.
Carnegie Tech’s segment will 
last 12 minutes in which the pos­
sibility exists that student demon­
strations of acting, stage move­
ment, and costume design will be 
given. Since the show will be live 
from campus, it is also possible 
that ihe heads of the various de­
partments in drama will be part 
of the show. A definite personal 
appearance, however, concerns 
that of Nancy Wick wire, a promi­
nent acting graduate from Tech,
It is of interest to note that the 
technical team for this show, one 
of four such teams that tour the 
country for “Wide, Wide World,” 
is the team that produced “Mis­
siles”, the show said to have been 
one of the best ever done. The 
program regularly has 0 to 5 mil­
lion viewers.

Congress Defeats Amendment 
To Change Chairmen Selection
At their last meeting Student Congress defeated Ihe last attempt 
to change the system dl choosing committee chairmen. They approved 
a revised system for activities keys, clarified the rulings pertaining to 
All School Functions, appropriated $200 to repair of Congress prop­
erty, and recommended the establishment of a man’s infirmary.
Susette Grove’s motion, the^—-----------------------------------------------
last in a series of proposed amend­
ments to the constitution designed 
t© change the system of choosing 
the chairmen of Homecoming, 
Spring Carnival, Carnegie Union, 
Freshmen Orientation, Leader­
ship Conferences, and Campus 
Chest, was defeated by a wide 
majority. So, for next year at 
least, these committee chairmen 
will eontinue to come from the 
activities honoraries.
Points And Keys
Carolou Fidler, chairman of the 
Points and Keys Committee, pre­
sented a revised system for 
awarding activities keys. This 
system, which was approved by 
Congress, provides for both keys 
and a new activities award. Any 
junior or senior is eligible. Forms 
are available in the Dean of Stu­
dents’ office, and must be return­
ed by March 30.
Executive Council proposed the 
ruling concerning All School 
Functions, which Congress ap­
proved. Carnegie Tech organiza­
tions may not hold meetings or 
social events during the hours of
an All School Function, except 
after 11:00 p.m.
The $200 appropriated for the 
replenishment of Student Con­
gress property was turned over to 
A Phi O, who handles this prop­
erty. Most of this money will be 
used to repair and recover the 
twenty five decoration fiats own­
ed by Congress.
Peter Sargent and George Es- 
kin, both alternates from the 
drama department, requested that 
Congress recommend that the ad­
ministration establish a men’s in­
firmary. The motion was passed.

Tech Sivamped 
Allegheny Tuesday 
Last At CIT Pool
In a warm-up for the ePnn- 
Ohio championship, Tech’s swim­
ming team easily defeated Alle­
gheny College 55-31 last Tuesday 
in the Skibo pool.
The Tartan quartet of Willock, 
Daugherty, Barlow, and Engleman 
started the meet off quickly by 
gaining an easy victory in the 400 
yard medley relay. In the 50 yard 
freestyle captain Mike Litch and 
Fred Schirm took one-two to in­
crease the Tartan lead. Hal Pas- 
trick and Abby Davis followed 
with an easy one-two finish in the 
diving before Mike Litch gained 
his second win of the meet by 
winning the 200 yard butterfly. 
John Barlow and Pat Crecine fol­
lowed Mike’s victory with a one- 
two finish in the 100 yard free­
style.
In the most outstanding per­
formance of the meet, Allegheny’s 
All-American, Hay Cox, won the 
200 yard backstroke in a new pool 
record of 2:13.3. Ray, who earlier 
defeated Tartan Pat Crecine in 
the 220 yard freestyle, is probably 
the best swimmer in this area. His 
time in the backstroke places him 
among the top backstrokers in the 
country.
In the 440 freestyle, Tech gain­
ed and took their fifth sweep of 
the meet as Ross Engleman and
Bob Shuck took one-two. In the 
200 yard breaststroke Ken Daugh­
erty climaxed the Tech scoring for 
the day as he gained a three 
stroke victory.
Ken, who is a sophomore chem­
ist from Pittsburgh, has done an 
outstanding job in his first year 
of swimming. Ken is not only the 
Tartan’s ntimber one performer in 
the 200 yard breaststroke, but is 
also a mainstay of the 400 yard 
medley relay.

Pittsburgh Playhouse 
Thornton Wilder’s “The Match­
maker” began a three-week run 
last Saturday at the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse. “The Matchmaker 
relates a day’s adventures in New 
York of a group of people from 
nearby Yonkers in the 1880’s, 
centering on a pompous, wealthy 
merchant who has gone to the me­
tropolis to seek a wife. \
His close advisor in the quest 
is a matchmaking widow who has 
determined that the merchant will 
marry her. Complications ensue 
from the unexpected encounters 
of *the merchant with his niece, 
who is running away with a pen 
niless artist, and the merchant’s 
chief clerk and his apprentice, 
who have taken the opportunity 
of their employer’s absence to go 
to the city for an unautho~;?ed 
lark of their own.
These embarrassing encounters 
are accompanied by numerous 
scenes of old-fashioned farce such 
as people hiding under tables, 
falling out of cupboards, masquer 
ading in othel- people’s costumes 
and many more examples of “hel­
ter-skelter exuberance.”

A Campus-to-Career Case History
Paul A. Twigg, Bachelor of Architectural Engineering, University of Detroit, ’53, 
in front of the 6-story building whose construction he supervised.
Paul Twigg’s Baby
Paul A. Twigg had been with Mich­
igan Bell Telephone Company for about 
a year when he was assigned to a project 
that was a “dream” for a young archi­
tectural engineer. He was to supervise 
construction of a 6-story, 175,000- 
square-foot addition to the telephone 
building in Grand Rapids.
“For the next two years,” Paul says, 
“I lived with the job as assistant to the 
Project Engineer. I interpreted the archi­
tect’s plans and specifications for the 
contractor, inspected construction, made 
on-the-spot revisions where necessary, 
and worked out the many problems 
which arise on a project of this size.
“I kept the Engineering office in De­
troit informed through daily logs and 
weekly progress reports. My boss pro­
vided reassuring supervision and advice 
on major problems by means of periodic 
visits to the job.”
The building was completed last 
August. Understandably, Paul thinks of 
it as his “two-miilion-dollar baby.” 
“An assignment like this really gives 
you a feeling of accomplishment,” Paul 
says. “It provides invaluable experience 
in your field. In fact, I’ve already been 
able to complete the first section of my 
Professional Registration Examination 
as an Architectural Engineer.”
To engineers in many fields, the Bell 
Telephone Companies offer big and in­
teresting assignments—assignments that 
challenge your ability, capitalize on 
your training^and provide real advance­
ment opportunities.
Many young men are finding interesting and re­
warding careers in the Bell Telephone Companies. 
Find out about the career opportunities for you. 
Talk with the Bell interviewer when he visits your 
campus. And read the Bell Telephone booklet which 
is on file in your Placement Office.

Thistle Future Seen Doubtful 
Unless Students Rally Support
Editor, The Tartan:
On behalf of the “Thistle” staff, I should like to thank the staffs 
of WRCT and the campus publications—most noticeably The Tartan 
—fqr their extensive help in advertising and publicizing the 1958 
“Thistle.” It has been indeed rewarding to those of us devoting time 
to working on the “Thistle” that others on campus find a yearbook 
a project worthy of attention.
In spite of your co-operation and encouragement, however, the 
student body as a whole is not responding to our publicity eampaijpi. 
Sales figures for the 1958 Thistle indicate that our students just I n’t 
care about having an annual.
Unless the situation changes, it is the sincere thought of the “This­
tle” staff and the Administration that there will be no publication 
of a year book in coming years. Without the support of the campus, 
“Thistle” publication will be forced to discontinue.
It is my hope that the seeming apathy is due to the mistaken idea 
on the part of the student body that 1958 “Thistles” will be available 
for purchase after April 1. This is simply not so. Any student who 
wishes to reserve his copy of the 1958 “Thistle” is urged to do so be­
fore April 1! may order his yearbook from the “Thistle” representa­
tive in his dormitory or fraternity, or from the “Thistle” desk in Ski­
bo, Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:30 to 1:30.
Sincerely,
Peggy Heath,
Editor, “Thistle”
rate unaffected by the eco­
nomic recession.
Last year an average graduate 
from E&S with a Bachelor of Sci­
ence received $465 per month. 
The average senior 22 years of 
age, can expect to receive only 
about $475 to $485. Any surprise 
evoked by this salary increase 
may be dispelled by realizing that 
a salaries in industry are brack­
eted and not particularly flexible, 
and that the small increase is only
in keeping with the cost of living.
With regard to summer jobs, 
Mr. Wangeman said, “The best 
chances lie in the service occupa­
tions—hotels, camps, etc.” Indus­
try will take a few men but no­
where near as many as in the past 
few years.
The situation for graduates of 
Margaret Morrision and Fine Arts 
will not be known for a month or 
two when recruiting for these 
graduates begins.

Editorial
Fraternities In Perspective
Last week in this column there appeared an editorial 
which caused no small stir in some quarters Finally the 
dander of a sizeable number of persons on this campus has 
been aroused a little. It has been quite a while.
However, despite the comments and despite the seeming­
ly strong convictions on the part of many, it has remained 
for a female to defend the fraternal system (see the letter, 
this page). The editorial went so far as to arouse interest 
among the city papers, yet Tech men remained relatively 
dormant. Perhaps they agreed'
We now pursue that same subject again with an eye to 
arousing some thought on the points discussed here and per­
haps more than one letter. However, the emphasis is to be 
changed so as to view the fraternities in a broader perspec­
tive. In passing, however, it is felt necessary to follow up last 
weewk’s editorial by asserting that fraternities fail to attract 
the men with high scholarship rating in the desired quanti­
ties because they fail to show the rushee a way of life suf­
ficiently commensurate with his educational goals.
Purposes and Achieving
Colleges are designed to promote the intellectual devel­
opment of the student. This development is not to take place 
at the expense of his physical and social development. Here 
fraternities regard themselves as playing their most im­
portant role.
Let us divert our attention from these more practical as­
pects and look at just what we’re after here at college a little 
more closely. Our growthinto full adulthood requires growth 
in three fields: physical, social, and intellectual. Colleges are 
designed primarily to facilitate development in the latter 
area.
We now ask just what is meant by “intellectual,” and 
the answer is apparent when we break this grand term down 
into knowledge and values. Intellectual growth demands in­
creased knowledge of both fact and principle and demands a 
firming of the foundations of the values which each student 
possesses—for values are the foundations of our thinking 
processes.
Whence Cometh Values?
At Carnegie Tech our education with regard to knowl­
edge is of highest quality. Fact and principle are studied dili­
gently throughout the 18 departments which compose this In­
stitution. However, our education with regard to values is 
pursued far less vigorously in the classroom. It is true that 
values play a part in the studies of the Fine Arts student, 
BUT in Engineering and Science and Margaret Morrison, 
values have a very small part. The social relations courses 
constitute the prime source of requirements to make value 
judgements and hence of value education. It is unfortunate 
that the engineering students receives so little of this training.

Alums
Survey Indicates 
That Tecli Alumni 
Are Club Joiners
By Cissie Rafferty
The question often arises on 
campus, “I wonder what the alums 
are doing since graduation. “We 
decided to con an investigation of 
the problem. We had seen a 
couple of them on the street in 
downtown Pittsburgh, but—except 
for giving them a dime for a cup 
of coffee—we hadn’t really talked 
with any.
So, we interviewed 400 fromer 
Techites and discovered that all of 
them belonged to a club. This, to 
us, was indicative of high social 
status — visions of the Duquesne 
Club, the country clubs, etc. Cry­
stallized in our minds. Unfortu­
nately, further investigation prov­
ed that the club they belonged to 
was the Cargnegie Tech Alumnae 
Club. (Well, it IS a club!)
In our never-ending search for 
truth, we tried to interview a 
P&D in his new work, but were 
unable to talk to him because his 
billboard was out of ear-shot.
We searched out a 1957 grad­
uate of the dramatics school whom 
we had heard was gainfully em­
ployed in television. (Who we had 
heard? I are a English major, but 
I ain’t never been sure of them 
technicalities.) Anyhoo . . . the 
Tech protege had a solo in the 
main song of the program. Breath­
lessly, the investigating commit­
tee awaited the first glorious note 
— M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E. 
(Well, it IS a club!)
We located two civil engineers 
who had been DU’s here at school. 
They were engaged in public serv­
ice work. In other words, they 
were working on a problem with 
the Fire Department pertaining to 
swimming pools. The exact pro­
blem was a little ambiguous, and 
the DU public relations depart­
ment threatened the committee 
with a punitive weapon if we 
published the facts. (A club, of 
course.) (You think you’re sick 
from just reading it, how would 
you like to have your friends 
know you wrote such balderdash).

Gym Courses Lack ...
Editor, the Tartan:
No other class in this school is so strict about attendant ; 
as is gym class. One cut without a written medical excuse 
is an automatic “R” for the semester—whereas most instruc­
tors in other classes allow two to four cuts per semester. Two 
years of gym are required for graduation. Because these re­
quirements are so stiff, we may conclude that CIT must place 
a high value on physical education.
Why then .does the gym department not offer a better 
course to the students than the one which we are now made 
to attend? Why don’t they have a better variety of gy*" „1 
equipment and teach the students who are interested to use
' ----------------?it? I have seen a better selection
of gym equipment in each of he 
two high schools which I attended. 
Surely, this school with as large 
a student body as we have can af­
ford more than a high school with 
an enrollment of about 1000 stu­
dents. Here at Tech we have no 
parallel bars, no high bar, no 
rings, no side horses, or trampo- 
lin for use in the gy mclasses th (
I have seen in two and one-half 
semesters of gym. We have two 
climbing ropes that are so short 
that you find yourself at th^ top 
of them almost before you begin 
to climb, and these are equipped 
with neither mats under them nor 
chalk for your hands. The ath­
letic fields outside are ill kept and 
dangerous. They are covered with 
rocks and when it rains they turn 
into quagmires. The towels th ^ 
we have to use smell as thougn 
they were washed in a cheap 
grade of sheep dip. And further­
more, the man who is in charge 
of the towels rarely says two civil 
words to the students in the same 
day. And he says a lot!
The equipment that we do have 
is so restricted that it is almost 
impossible to use if the student 
has morning classes. “No equip­
ment can be signed out between 
3:30 and 4:30 is the rule and Fraiíi? 
leaves at 4:30 so you can’t borrow 
it at 4:30 either. Even if you go 
over to the gym in the morning it 
is generally about as possible to 
obtain a punching bag or the key 
to the box of weights as it is to 
blow your brains out with a water 
pistol, unless you have a gym 
class at the time..
The gym instructors do not in­
struct—they just supervise. Some­
times they will strain themselvi * 
enough to lead calisthenics but 
generally they select a student to 
do this for them. (Not that I am 
advocating calisthenics!) They 
seem to believe that their jobs go 
no further than calling the roll 
and then saying “two laps around 
the gym then play basketball” or 
some other game. The instructors 
then seem to feel that they have 
earned a real rest and stand 
around batting the breeze for tbio; 
rest of the period. It is a rare

“Factors” Editorial 
Causes Comment
Editor, the Tartan:
What are we printing in the 
Tartan these days? Let’s get off 
the high horse of emotion and 
down to some clear-cut facts. I 
refer in particular to the Editorial 
in the February 25 issue titled 
‘Fracternity Factors!’ Reducing 
the verbiage of this article you 
might condense its argument to, 
“Fraternity factors are 0.08 lower 
than the all-men’s average; there­
fore they are worthless and should 
be abolished.” Tell me, E.H.R., did 
you ever have a course in logic?
Let’s see what fraternities are 
supposed to do before we decide 
that they are worthless. According 
to the Constitution of one of the 
fraternities on campus, a fratern­
ity is formed to “promote the in­
tellectual and spiritual welfare of 
its members.” I believe this is 
typical of fraternity purposes. 
And it seems to be a pretty worthy 
purpose. We certainly need or­
ganizations who propose to do 
these things, if indeed they ac­
complish something.
But how are we to measure the 
degree to which the fraternities 
accomplish their objectives. Cer­
tainly not by saying, “Fraternity 
factors are 0.08 lower than the 
all-male average; therefore, they 
have failed to carry out their ob­
jectives.” Even if factor is to be 
the only measure of worth in our 
campus community, we can hard­
ly say that a 0.08 difference in fac­
tors is statistically significant. But, 
why should factor be the univers­
al measuring stick? Sure, we’re 
here to learn about calculus and 
physics, but that isn’t all we’re 
here for. We’re here to learn how 
to get along with other people. 
We’re here to formulate the basic 
ideas and ideals which will stay 
with us for the rest of our lives. 
A factor is not necessarily a mea­
sure of how much we grow, how

sight to see a gym instructor ac­
tually instructing. I think that this 
attitude is the main cause for the 
lack of equipment or use of equip­
ment. Real “gym” teaching such 
as the articles that I mentioned 
takes real teaching. You don’t just

to go play with them as you can 
do with a basketball.
The only depatrment of the gym 
that can escape criticism in my 
opinion, is the swimming depart­
ment. We have a good pool and
Earl J. Birdy is a good instructor. 
He offers courses for advanced 
swimmers and also takes an in­
terest in beginners.“Not so With 
advanced or beginning gym stu­
dents. The beginner is left to shift 
for himself an dthe student who 
is interested and enjoys gymnas­
tics is retarded by lack of equip­
ment and instruction.
Perhaps if the rest of the gym 
department took some lessons 
from the way the swimming class­
es are run a lot of the antagonis­
tic attitude between students and 
gym department would be elimi­
nated.

Free Trade 
Or Else!
By Richard Block
“What people need and can’t 
get, they may fight for; otherwise 
they will find a substitute for it.” 
“What will happen to the world 
value of the dollar if it is not 
readily available through trade?” 
These are statements delivered by 
Claire Boothe Luce in a recent ad­
dress on the need for free trade. 
Following is a summary of the 
material in the text.
Refusal to Face Hard Facts
In talking foreign trade with 
intelligent Americans almost any­
where, the quick decision is reach­
ed that foreign tariff barriers are 
evil. We are quick to declare this 
evil in discussing trade between 
other countries. Why is it we seem 
to be somewhat blind and deaf in 
evaluating our own tariffs? We 
refuse to face the hard fact that 
while many economic bodies are 
struggling to liberalize trade and 
prevent backsliding, this whole 
effort, and the whole question as 
to whether trade is to expand or 
contract, depends on American 
leadership and the accessibility of 
the American market, which is 
the largest in the world.
It is better, through protection­
ism and erratic employment of

Soiled Rush
At 6:30 today formal(?) rushing ends. At 7:30 Panhel- 
lenic Council will begin its evaluation of rush. Unavoidably 
discussion will center around the practice of dirty rushing, 
which apparently has been in vogue this semester in one 
form or another by at least four of the seven sororities.
(For those persons who do not know the term dirty 
rushing, it is defined rather loosely as: railroading the 
rushee, mass gatherings of actives around one or two 
rushees outside of rushing hours, issuing promises of a bid, 
threatening the rushee, inviting the rushee to non-Panhel- 
lenic scheduled functions, and breaking silence period.)
At present, Panhel has no strict definition of this prac­
tice. In formal rush, there has always ben a “gentlemen’s 
agreement” concerning infringement of the rules. The au­
thors of the set of regulations concerning rushing and the 
Judicial Board did not foresee the possibility that any soror­
ity or sorority girl would not have the integrity to go by 
this unwritten agreement; that the agreement would be so 
flagrantly and cntinuously violated.
This rush season has been an eye-opener for Panhel. It 
has proven that some sororities need to have the unwritten 
laws spelled out for them and the penalties for breaking 
these laws a constant threat before they can or will conduct 
themselves in an ethical, ladylike manner. However, what 
has been done is by now so much water over the dam. The 
important thing is that Panhel define dirty rushing, make 
clear the penalties, and set up a system whereby infringe­
ment of the rules can be dealt with easily and quickly dur­
ing the rush period.
There should be included in the Judicial Board’s organ­
ization a provision for the right of (1) sorority to accuse 
sorority; (2) individual to accuse sorority; and (3) rushee 
to accuse sorority. At present, while the first is provided 
for, the latter two rights are lacking and as a result action 
against violations is impeded.
In order to provide these two, a committee, which 
would consist of the accuser (rushee or individual), the 
president of Panhel (if a member of the accused sorority, 
then the vice-president), and one other member of the 
Panhellenic executive board (vice-president, secretary, or 
treasurer—not to be a member of the accused sorority), 
could be set up. This committee would hear the complaints, 
gather the evidence, and if the case proved to be valid bring 
the charges before the Judicial Board.
If such a system such as this had existed this year, and 
if the definition of dirty rushing had been explicit, little or 
no dirty rushing would have been practiced. Certainly, it 
would not have snowballed as it did, to the extent that the 
administration would be upset with the sorority system, 
.that the rushees would be confused or disgusted with the 
sororities, and that there would be hard feelings between 
sororities. ^ p

Ski bos Easily Defeat 
Grove City, Wash &Jeff
Grove City
By Mike Berman
Tech went on to beat Grove 
City Tuesday night 94-74 in the 
Skibo Gym for the varsity’s 
eleventh victory of the season. 
In their last home showing this 
year Carnegie led all the way 
from the opening basket to the 
final whistle. The greater part of 
the scoring was done by little men 
Bill Soffa (20), Tom Mueller (17), 
and John Tucci (13), while the 
rebounding chores were taken 
care of by Goetz and Komer.
The Tartans piled up points 
throughout the first half and led 
at halftime 48-32. The Plaids 
built up their lead even more in 
the second half to go ahead by 20 
midway through the period.
Jump Shot
It was the jump shot that prov­
ed most valuable to the Tartans. 
They hit for 46% of their shots 
which accounted for their high 
score (second only to the 108 
game earlier this year).
The end of the game marked 
the end of the college basketball 
careers for such Tech favorites as 
John Tucci. Harry Rupert, and 
Charlie Goetz. Goetz was a main 
asset in the Tartan's late season 
drive for victories. His splendid 
rebounding and clutch scoring 
helped Tech to many a late sea­
son win. His 20 points Tuesday 
night shouldn’t be overlooked 
either.
Wash. & Jeff.
Tech’s fast moving basketball 
team copped a 70-44 victory over 
a game but outclassed Washing­
ton and Jefferson aggregation last 
Wednesday on the opponents 
court.
The game started out slowly 
with neither team being able to 
hit on their outside shots. The 
W&J offense was much toned 
down and this kept the Tartans
from coming through with much 
scoring.
Tech jumped off to a quick lead 
and held it through the first half 
to lead 21-17 at half time. Bill 
Soffa lead the Skibo offense in this 
half and the Prexies were unable 
to stop him throughout the rest of 
the contest.
W&J ran into fouling difficulties 
in the third quarter and three of 
their starters had fouled out with 
nine minutes remaining in the 
game. Tech took advantage of this 
and easily pulled away for an 
easy win.
Bill Soffa lead the Tartan scor­
ing with 30 points on nine field 
goals and 12 out of 13 foul shots. 
Andy Komer had 13 and John 
Tucci 12 respectively for the rest 
of the high Tech scoring.
The win gave Tech a season’s 
record of twelve wins against 10 
defeats and assures the squad of 
their first winning season in three 
years.

Obelisks Defeat 
Sigma Nu, BSR 
Delts For Title
The Obelisks won the Intra­
mural bowling championship in a 
four way playoff with Sigma Nu 
and Delta Tau Delta and 
Sigma Rho.
The Obelisk five won all three 
games with a 755-812-772 series 
of 2349 total pins. Sigma Nu was 
second with 796-703-767 for a pin 
total of 2266; eighty-three pins be­
hind the Obelisks. The Delts were 
third with 2252 total pins and Beta 
Sigs had a 2019 total.
The win also gave the Obelisks 
the Tartan League championship 
since they were tied with Sigma 
Nu for the title. ATO finished 
third and SAE fourth.
The Delts had already copped 
the title in the Kiltie League with 
Beta Sig and Phi Kappa a distant 
third.
Jim Swisher of Sigma Nu had 
the high series for the day with 
537 pins. He had also held the 
high average for the years total. 
Drake lead the Obelisks with a 
517 pin total and Don MacFarlane 
headed the Delts with 496 pins.
Tartan congratulations to the 
Obelisks in winning and also to 
the runner up teams in the play­
offs on turning in some fine scores.

The Carnegie Plaid Needs News;
Let’s Have Lots Of Co-operation
A few weeks ago many eve­
ning students complained that 
there were not enough papers to 
go around. With the coperation of 
the Tartan there is -now a suffic­
ient supply of papers on hand 
every night. Now that there is a 
supply of papers for everyone to 
read, let’s give them some news. 
Any student or organization that
w’ould like to have an article or 
letter printed in the “Plaid“ 
should contact the editor by Wed­
nesday of each week or drop the 
item in the intra-school mailbox. 
Your cooperation is needed to 
make the Carnegie “Plaid” an in­
formative paper.

Factors-
[continued from vage 4] 
much we mature during our stay 
here at Tech.
Perhaps our fraternities aren’t 
doing all they could to help their 
members get the most out of their 
college careers. But you’re going 
to have to do an awful lot of talk­
ing about things other than factors 
to convince the majority of us 
Techites.
J. D. Blutman
IM ’60
(Editor’s Note: It appears that 
Miss Blutman is a bit emotional 
herself. Factors are not, of course, 
100% valid measures of attain­
ment of intellectual welfare as is 
above pointed out. However, does 
it not seem reasonable that or­
ganizations which are designed to 
(among other things) “promote 
the intellectual and spiritual wel­
fare of its members” should at 
least achieve the mean scholastic­
ally while pursuing their other 
varied activities? Each and every 
one of us must recognize that 
nearly the only documented re­
cord of our achievements at Tech 
(and that one to which reference 
is most often made) is the grade 
record; and we must recognize 
that these grades are related 
strongly to the knowledge and 
abilities ivhich we possess.)
By Edward Blum
This month, while the Rockets, 
i ATO, ASCE, and the Englishmen 
were tallying victories, Citcom suf­
fered a severe loss. Their top per­
former, sophomore Ed Wovchko, on 
whom their title hopes were pin­
ned, fouled out of school on 
grades. The loss, especially costly 
because the commuters have play­
ed only one game thus far, and 
have five tough contests remain­
ing, probably means that the title 
round will proceed, for the first 
time in several years, without the 
presence of Citcom. Kappa Sigma 
has secured the league title, and 
the TX Unknowns appear destined 
for second place, nosing out the de­
fan ged Citcom.
In the Scot League, a titanic bat­
tle is shaping up between two pow­
erful independent teams: the Eng­
lishmen and the Grad Iggles. The 
high scoring Englishmen, possess­
ing a three-way scoring punch, 
have run over all their opponents 
so far. Their 3ole remaining game 
is with the ex-varsity laden Grad 
Iggles, who also are undefeated to 
date, and who have a second Con­
test, with third place Delta Up- 
silon, remaining besides the cham­
pionship contest with the English­
men.
Plaid League
Over in the Plaid League, Beta 
Theta Pi A ran up its fifth win 
in as many games by trouncing 
| the winless ATO Jags. Trailing in 
second place are the schedule- 
| handicapped Delts, who were vic­
torious in their only contest, and 
like Citcom, have five games re- 
1 maining.
Elsewhere, the Rockets and ATO 
B each won again in the Kiltie 
League. The tall, straight-shoot­
ing senior civil engineers added 
another victory to increase their 
i lead over second place favorites 
; SAE A. Both the Grads and ATO 
| A are unbeaten in the Skibo 
j League, but observers report that 
, the depth, height, and ability of 
ATO will offset the extra experi­
ence and know-how of the Grads 
i when the two teams clash on 
| March 10.
All games that were cancelled 
j Friday, February 14, because of 
the Jazz Concert in the Gym will 
be played the evening of March 10 
at the same times and on the same 
I courts that were previously sched-
l uled. The following day, next 
Tuesday, March 11, first round IM 
basketball playoffs begin. Watch

The final record came in the 
400 yard freestyle relay as the 
Tartan quartet of Crecine, 
Scherm, Barlow, and Litch erased 
.9 seconds from the meet record 
and nearly 2 seconds from the 
school record. In the opening leg, 
Pat Crecine out-touched McGin­

Fred Schirm quickly opened the 
lead to two yards. John Barlow
added another yard before Cap­

Because engineering is a profession at GM 
-we offer you a career-not a job
OTe cehSwT engineering standards at 
General Motors are so high is that GM 
recognizes engineering as a profession. And 
the men who engineer the many different 
products made by General Motors are 
respected for the profession they practice.
That is why, when you are invited to join 
General Motors as an engineer, you don’t 
simply take a job—you start a career.
It is a career that is rewarding both profes­
sionally and financially—starting on your first 
day of association with General Motors at any 
one of its 35 divisions and 126 plants in 70 
cities and 19 slates.
During your early days at GM, for example, 
you work with a senior engineer who guides 
your career along professional lines.
You are also actively encouraged to pursue 
your education towards an advanced degree. 
For we at General Motors recognize that, in 
doing so, you will become more valuable to 
us and the engineering profession.
You are given the opportunity to obtain pro­
fessional recognition through participation 
in engineering society forums, presentation 
of technical papers, winning of patents and 
other recognition of your accomplishments.
And you are also encouraged to take an active 
role in your community’s affairs—because a 
truly professional man is a good citizen as 
well as a good engineer.
All this is for a reason—and a good one.
Many of the men who will fill the key posi­
tions at GM in the future are the young engi­
neers joining GM today. This is not theory, 
it is fact. For 14 of our 33 Vice-Presidents are 
engineers, 23 of our 42 Division General Man­
agers are engineers, too.
Today we are looking for young engineers— 
such as you—who may fill these positions 
tomorrow. The rewards —both professional 
and financial—are substantial. If you feel you 
have the ability, write us. It could be the most 
important letter of your life.
June graduates!
A General Motors Representative will 
be on hand to answer questions about 
job opportunities with GM.

Fraternities—
[continued from page 4]
. Here is that fraternities enter 
the picture. It is evidently up to 
some outside influence to round 
out the education of the students. 
This influence must be found in 
his way of life. The way of life of 
nearly 800 men on this campus is 
bound up in the 12 fraternities.
-In our formal studies, such 
value judgments as are made, are 
made via discussion and written 
papers. In the fraternities then, 
since it would be absurd to re­
quire written papers, discussion is 
the practical means whereby this 
portion of education may be 
achieved.
The Fraternal Failing
And it is here that the frater­
nities fall down with a rather tre­
mendous thud. One need only to 
listen to dinner table conversation 
for a while to ascertain that rarely 
is much of significance said. Con­
versation tends toward a mean. 
This is true not only at the dinner 
table but throughout the frater­
nity day. Now the Tartan does not 
advocate discussion groups from 
basement to roof, but the Tartan 
does advocate a social freedom to 
indulge in serious conversation 
and thought — an atmosphere 
which rather than rundown »this 
sort of thing, encourages it.
More formal discussions which 
might even include a faculty 
member are quite possibly in a 
fraternity house and are to be 
strongly encouraged. By virtue of 
its degree of organization a fra­
ternity should be better off than 
the dorms or commuters.
The Social,and Physical 
Values
A properly balanced set of val­
ues will recognize the value of 
study, for those very reasons given 
in the Editor’s Note appended to 
Miss Blutman’s letter (pages 4 
and 5).
Thereby fraternity averages 
should go up. A properly bal­
anced set of values will recognize 
the value of social attainment and 
physical exercise as well, for their 
facilitation of intellectual prog­
ress if nothing else.
To sum it up, the common val­
ues existing in Tech fraternities 
do not include as having signifi­
cant value such things as think­
ing and discussion of thoughts 
which go beyond the mere triviali-^ 
ties of everyday existence. And as 
a result nothing is done about it. 
These are not the values expressed 
in. most fraternity constitutions. 
Perhaps the situation is that those 
who should be asserting them­
selves in order to promote a 
healthy college atmosphere are 
too weak to do so.
E. H. R.
Observations—
[continued on page 5] 
the all too familiar "escape 
clause” in our trade agreements 
to keep uneconomic American 
enterprises alive, at the expense 
of the American consumer; or to 
practice abroad what we have
DRESSYOUR
PART
for dress 
for play 
for every
$9.95 to
practiced at home — honest com­
petition?
"You Can't Just Close Down 
American Business"
The first and loudest objection 
to this approach is that you can­
not close down American busi­
nesses, and throw people out of 
work, even if it is uneconomic-Jy- 
(not if you are a Congressman 
seeking re-election, at any rate). 
In our dynamic economy more 
than a million people change their 
jobs every month. This is a great 
deal more people than would be 
affected by the removal of traffic. 
Moreover, imports are a sure-fire 
weapon against inflation, and do 
constant favors for the consumer. 
The consumer has some political 
force. David McDonald of tmr 
Steelworkers and others have pro­
posed that hardship cases result­
ing from tariff cuts receive spec­
ial government help for the tran­
sition to new products and new 
jobs. This is a sound proposal. '
Security Reasons?
There are some industries that 
are protected because of security 
reasons. Miss Luce favors direct 
subsidies. I also. In this way tbf. 
taxpayer will see whom he’s keep^f 
ing in business and why. It will, be 
a fast education when he sees that 
his tax dollars are being used to 
subsidize and protect uneconomic 
competitors and are a direct levy 
on him as a consumer.
Why Trust Us?
Our trade agreemetns all con­
tain one clause that would breed 
mistrust in any associate. It is the 
“escape clause” mentioned abov J) 
In brief, this clause permits thé 
United States to break a trade 
agreement whenever the govern­
ment wishes. This is sow it looks 
to our friends abroad. Why 
shouldn’t they lean to the Soviet 
Union for trade? Russia offers 
them better terms.
The gross national product gen­
erated last year in this country 
was $414 billion. Can we not af­
ford to accept two billion dollar * 
in increased imports? It seems to' 
me that ¦ this is a good way to 
strengthen very weak ties of 
friendship in the world and also 
maintain world trade leadership.
The Value of Clothespins
Less than a month ago, the 
United States doubled its tariff on 
spring operated wooden clothes­
pins. This was done to save a 
domestic industry composed of no 
more than six manufacturer ) 
whose average employees number 
barely 400 each — and who must 
compete anyway with the makers 
of plastic pins and automatic 
driers. And who got hit by this 
tariff? No fewer than nine friend­
ly exporitng countries including 
Sweden, Denmark, West Ger­
many, Belgium, The Netherlands, 
Austria, and Yugoslavia.
Until recently when a few pre­
cision instrument companies de > 
cided that it would be more profit­
able to produce those precision 
instruments other than watches to 
compete with a vastly superior 
Swiss watch industry, we were on 
the brink of harming that valu­
able import business. As it is, the 
prices on watches are fantastical­
ly out of proportion to necessity.
I could name many, other areas 
where we have really hurt our­
selves and friends with our hard 
headed refusal to make progress 
in a world that demands it. Even 
now, there were explosions in 
Congress when the President ask­
ed that the present, insufficient 
reciprocal trade program be ex­
tended.
“What people can’t get and 
need, they may fight for; other­
wise they will find a substitute for 
it.” That is what has been hap­
pening to the dollar. Nations ar' 
trying to relieve themselves of the 
scarcity of the dollar. They are 
trying to relieve themselves of the 
necessity of the dollar. If and 
when they are able to do this, the 
dolJar will lose its place in world 
trade.
“Let us give some concrete and 
dynamic evidence of our will to 
achieve, in conjunction with our 
allies, economic strength and well­
being for all of us.” These are th _} 
final words of Miss Luce’s ad­
dress.
