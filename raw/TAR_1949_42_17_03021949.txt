Dormicom Scores Smashing Victory
Flashing Victory Smiles
Victorious Dormicom candidates pose for a victory smile. They

Dormicom Finds Victory Sweet, 
Still Has Rough Sledding Ahead
Riding the crest of a wave of Independent election interest never 
before matched, Dormicom’s successful candidates celebrated their 
victory last weekend and prepared their strategy for the coming
Council meetings. ?-----------------------------------------------------
And if Arbon Lang enjoys a 
chuckle at the Council meeting 
this afternoon when his party 
cohorts take office he will prob­
ably desen o it. For the weighted 
preferential system of ballot count­
ing, long a target of Lang’s at­
tacks, was largely responsible for 
Dormicom’s near shutout victory.
A Slight Edge 
Nevertheless, a large fraternity 
carryover Council will make the 
acceptance of the Hare system 
only a faint possibility, since a 
two-thirds majority is needed to 
change a by-law. Dormicom will 
be able to count on, at best, a 
bare *Vnajority of Council after to­
day’s meeting.
The campaign that seated the 
even dozen Dormicom members 
on Council was the most thorough 
and effective seen here in many
years. The giant rally last Wed­
nesday night overcame the obsta­
cles of a rival Tau Delta Phi 
loudspeaker and stolen fuses from 
the power system to draw, ac­
cording to Gerry Meyers, “over 
1000 people.”
No Wasted Votes
The secret behind Dormicom’s 
success was primarily in their 
failure to waste votes on “strong” 
candidates. By following the fra­
ternity method of voting a “pat­
tern” the party was able to give 
all its candidates approximately 
the same number of points.
For instance, in Engineering 
less than 200 points separated the 
first and last Dormicom men elect­
ed, while last spring Gerry Meyers 
had 380 points more than his 
nearest competitor and 640 more 
than he needed to be elected.

WCIT Unable 
To Broadcast
Difficulties Prevent 
Operation This Year
Carnegie’s campus radio sta­
tion, WCIT, will not resume 
broadcasting activities this year, 
Bob Coddington, station manager, 
admitted last week when it be­
came apparent that too many dif­
ficulties faced the station for im­
mediate solution.
Among the difficulties which 
must be corrected are those of 
frequency interference with other 
stations and the obtaining of suit­
able space for the studios.
Last year the station operated 
from a room in the drama depart­
ment. When the department need­
ed the space this year, new quar­
ters were secured in the base­
ment of the Carnegie Union. 
Renovation of these new prem­
ises will be necessary, according 
to Coddington, before broadcast­
ing can be resumed.
At present there is an eleven- 
man executive board, but when 
the station again resumes opera­
tions a larger staff of technicians 
and announcers will be needed.
Management Seniors To Make 
Market Survey On Bookstore
“Do you want an expanded bookstore?” will be a question put 
to a number of Carnegie students next week. This question will be 
among those asked in the course of a market survey being under­
taken by a senior management engineering course in marketing.
Although the survey will be* 
made in such a way that its re­
sults might easily be used in ac­
tually expanding the store, the 
school has no official interest in 
the survey and no intention of 
utilizing its results. It is solely a 
class project.
Among the questions to be 
asked in the course of the survey 
will be such as whether the stu­
dents want a larger store, where 
it might be located, what sort of 
merchandise it should carry, and 
how much would the students 
spend.
The particular methods and 
questions of the survey will be 
decided by the students in the 
course, which is being given for 
the first time this semester. Not 
all students will be quizzed, for 
small samples of the student body 
will be selected as “typical” po­
tential customers.
Decorations
Access to the decorations 
owned by Student Council 
can be gained in the future 
only through contacting either 
Miss Stewart in the Dean of 
Men’s office or Bennard Perl­
man, permanent decorations 
chairman.
The janitorial staff in the 
gym will no longer have ac­
cess to the room, and keys 
will be available only from 
the above two people. It is 
advised that Miss Stewart or 
Mr. Perlman be contacted well 
in advance of any affair, so 
that conflicting dates can be 
straightened out.

Independents Capture 
Twelve Council Seats
Active Campaign Wins Engineering 
Majority, Fine Arts Landslide
By Robert Johnson
Dormicom scored a smashing victory last Friday by elect­
ing twelve of its candidates to Student Council. Of the four 
other positions which were open, fraternity men filled only two.
The thumping majority was a satisfying climax to the active 
campaign waged by Gerry Meyers, Arbon Lang, and their Dormicom 
co-workers who treated the campus to the most colorful and in­
genious election drive seen on this campus since before the war. 
Dormicom candidates John Fondrk, Wallace Parr, Theodore
?Goodson, Fred Price, and James 
Horsch were elected on the reg­
ular ballot in Engineering, while 
Henry Clay won the race for the 
unexpired term. James Reynolds 
and Robert Sinclair won the oth­
er two positions.
Sweep In Arts 
In Fine Arts Dormicom scored 
a complete sweep of all four posi­
tions, placing Wes Kenney, Thom­
as Sedgwick, Louis Shulick, and 
Dorothy Gillan. Marilyn Gasche 
won the only Dormicom seat in 
Margaret Morrison, Sally Hutch­
inson and Laura Ehni taking the 
other two voting positions. Judy 
Garb, Dormicom’s candidate for 
non-voting assistant secretary, 
won that position.
From all indications the vote 
in Council today for the new Pres­
ident of that governing body will 
be the closest^'in recent history 
It is virtually certain that Dormi­
com will run Gerry Meyers for 
the position and the fraternities 
will run Pat Ryan.
Girls Hold rfey
An informal tabulation of the 
various loyalties involved shows 
that the elec­
tion will prob­
ably be decided 
by the Mar­
garet Morrison
Don Stitt
* * * *
Stitt Elected 
To Presidency 
Of IF Council
Don Stitt was elected president 
of the Interfraternity council on 
February 21. He succeeds Lee 
Wiley who had resigned the posi­
tion the preceding week. At the 
same time Allen Mitchell resigned 
as the council’s vice president and 
social chairman.
The new president indicated 
that no sweeping changes in IF 
plans were forseeable in the near 
future. He said, “IF is running 
smoothly; there is nothing to re­
vamp or change at present. Ar­
rangements and preparations for 
Greek Sing and Swing have just 
been completed. We are, how­
ever, trying for a clarification on 
the question of chaperons for 
social functions from Dean Camp­
bell’s office.”
He also stated that the council 
was considering another inter­
fraternity picnic because of the 
success of last year’s picnic.
In explanation of his resigna­
tion Wiley said, “I resigned be­
cause I have recently been elected 
president of Delta Upsilon, and 
I don’t think I could handle both 
jobs, nor would I be able to voice 
my opinion in IF matters, since I 
will be the chapter’s representa­
tive in IF.”
Like Wiley, Mitchell laid the 
cause of his retiring on extra­
curricular activities. He is presi­
dent of Sigma Nu fraternity. No 
one has been named* to replace 
him.
girls whose 
loya 11 i e s are

siderations.
This election 
will be the first 
time in recent Pat Ryan 
history raise a strong possibility 
that a non-fraternity man may 
be elected to the important Coun­
cil Presidency.
By all indications the candidates 
will not be split by more than one 
or two votes, with Ryan appar­
ently having the edge. However, 
Dormicom’s ability at vote-get­
ting, io strikingly demonstrated 
in the election, cannot be over­
looked.
Turnout Doubled
Dormicom’s electioneering was 
so successful that in both Fine 
... ________ Arts and Mar­
garet Morrison 
the turnout of 
voters was sig­
nificantly more 
than twice as 
great as in the 
previous elec­
tion. The Fine 
Arts turnout of 
52 per cent was 
a new record. 
Margaret Mor-
Gerry Meyers rison also 
showed 52 per cent voting. En­
gineering showed a total of 55 per 
cent.
“Ripper,” Sigma Nu’s last min­
ute canine candidate who all but 
disrupted the election, polled a 
grand total, in all colleges, of be­
tween 1000 and 1200 vote points.

Editorial
Interesting Davs AheadF
The fraternity machine has been beaten at 
its own game. The heretofore invincible jugger­
naut that has been self-confidently clicking off 
victory after victory may very well be shaken to 
its roots by the pasting it took from Dormicom.
An aroused, fighting independent machine took 
them on at their own game and administered a 
sound thrashing. To add insult to injury, Lang- 
Meyers, Inc. organized the Fine Arts School, a 
job the fraternities had never successfully tackled.
In addition to the immediate interesting ques­
tion of who will become Council president today, 
two questions of longer range interest present 
themselves: Will the fraternities learn anything 
after they clean up the blood and broken bones? 
Will Dormicom, by supporting and enacting 
strong constructive measures avoid the disrepute 
which fell on the last independent Council?.
The answer to the latter question will partly 
depend on whether Meyers becomes president, 
for the full responsibility for the executive func­
tions will go to Dormicom only if Meyers can 
appoint Dormicom members as committee chair­
men.
Try Campaigning
Regardless of this result, it will be interesting 
to watch Council’s operation to see if any signifi­
cant difference comes about because of Dormi- 
com’s strength.
The fraternities are not accustomed to being 
sent scampering for cover in quite so decisive a 
manner, and whether or not they will change 
their tactics in future elections may well deter­
mine the political picture for some time to 
come.
The feeling among some fraternity men of 
“let’s smash the independents” clearly backfired 
in this election. The Hare system of ballot count­
ing, which would have considerably softened the 
blow of defeat for the fraternities may now get 
some serious consideration.
Further, the drubbing may raise the question 
of why fraternities will not come out and hon­
estly seek support for their candidates. Surely 
the reason is not an inferiority complex.
The relatively feeble electioneering that dis­
tinguished most fraternity campaigns is not in 
keeping with the potential logic and justice which 
could be brought to bear in their favor.
There Is A Case!
The fact that a large proportion of fraternity 
men live on the campus, that a higher propor­
tion of their members participate in activities 
under Council’s jurisdiction, and that many of 
their members have experience in school af­
fairs are all good reasons by which fraternity 
men can justify a significant representation on 
Council.
Nor is their inclination to pledge underclass­
men who demonstrate leadership ability to be 
discounted. Why, then, is there a continuation 
of the supercilious attitude of refusing to in­
dulge in such “common” actions as admitting that 
they are trying to elect the men in their group.
The fiction has been denounced through ac­
tion, not words, from a determined and effective 
machine that has whipped the fraternities at 
their own game. The time has come for Carnegie 
fraternity men to re-examine their prejudices 
and discard their medieval thinking which has 
just now served to entrap them in their own 
snares.
Metallurgists 
Build Smallest 
Blast Furnace
One of the smallest blast fur­
naces in the world has been built 
by the metallurgical engineering 
department as a class project. The 
department’s prodigy has literally 
produced only a thimbleful of pig 
iron to date, but recent improve­
ments have made greater future 
production possible.
Unlike industrial furnaces, the 
model was built for “batch opera­
tions” and will be used for both 
research and demonstration pur­
poses. The furnace is seven feet 
high and has a hearth diameter of 
fourteen inches.
Several tests have proven that 
the furnace is easily capable of 
producing temperatures high 
enough to smelt iron. Recent at­
tempts to produce pig iron have 
been unsuccessful because of fail­
ures in the pump supplying air for 
the blast.
Did You Work?
Anyone who worked for the 
post office during the Christ­
mas holidays, is requested to 
report this fact to the Dean of 
Men’s office as soon as possi­
ble.
No More Reviews
The Tartan will no longer print reviews of 
drama department productions in the Carnegie 
theater. The drama faculty feel that these plays, 
as the class work of the students in that depart­
ment, should not be subject to the criticism and 
analysis of other students which would be in­
herent in a review.
The editors of the Tartan, though they feel 
that these reviews have served a number of use­
ful purposes, are willing to accede to the drama 
department request that the practice of review­
ing plays be discontinued.
The Editor.
Library Soon To Add 
Micro-card Viewer
Modern science is increasing the service that 
the school library can give to the students and 
faculty.
Latest in a series of new additions will be a 
micro-card viewer, soon to be added to the li­
brary’s facilities. It will enable the library to 
store 100 pages of printed text on a card the size 
of a picture postcard.
In addition, the copies are much easier to in­
dex, and finding a particular page of a given 
publication is merely a matter of twisting a few 
dials.
Easy To Use
By inserting the micro-card in the viewer 
and adjusting its position, the user can select 
quickly and easily whichever page he desires. 
Although the micro-cards will be used to sup­
plement the use of micro-film, now in use here, 
they are much superior to the films for they cost 
much less per page of text and they simplify the 
locating of specific material.
Pages on the cards appear so small to the 
naked eye that each line of type is seen only as 
a blurred line.
The micro-film reader is being used to dis­
play condensed books, magazines, and periodi­
cals. A book photographed page by page may be 
stored in the library on a few small rolls of 
film. Then, when the book is needed for ref­
erence, the film is placed in the micro-film reader 
which enlarges and projects each page on a large 
sheet of frosted glass. As much as a full month’s 
issues of the New York Times can be put on 
three films.
Advantages of the micro-film and micro-card 
readers are many. Before the war CIT received 
copies of Japanese periodicals valuable for the 
charts and tables contained therein, but the war 
yeai^s cut short the supply. Now, since the war, 
these back issues, formerly unavailable, form an 
important part of the files of the library—in mi­
cro-film form.
Open To All
At the same time, using the new device, the 
library is building up a consecutive collection of 
copies of the New York Times. Now on file are 
the issues of the Times from January, 1947, to 
the present. Each year one previous year will be 
added to the collection along with current issues.

Campus Groups To Participate 
In Religious Discussion Week
Groups participating in Religious Emphasis week, March 6-11, 
will be led in discussion by 15 ministers of the Protestant, Catholic 
and Jewish faiths. “How Do We Determine Right Conduct?” is the 
subject to be considered in all the discussions.
Fraternities, sororities, men’s*
and women’s dormitories, Citcom 
Clan, Christian Fellowship, New­
man club, YMCA, YWCA, and 
other denominational groups have 
all scheduled speakers, and will 
announce plans at their regular 
meetings. With the exception of 
Phi Kappa, Sigma Nu, and Beta 
Sigma Rho, who will hold a joint 
meeting at the Union, fraternities 
will hold their discussions at their 
respective chapter houses. All 
other groups will meet at the 
Union.
Rev. V. P Martin of the Sec­
ond Presbyterian Church of Wil- 
kinsburg will be the speaker on 
March 9, 4:30 p m. at the dis­
cussion sponsored by Citcom Clan. 
At 7:30 on March 10, the YMCA 
and YWCA will have as their 
speaker Mr. Paul Offenheise, ex­
ecutive secretary of the Wilkins-
burg YMCA and delegate to the 
United Nations meeting in Cleve­
land. The Christian Fellowship 
has invited Rev. Loran Veith to 
speak at its meeting on Friday, 
March 11 at 7:30 p. m. These dis­
cussions are open to all students 
and friends.
Knitters Wanted
Kiltie Band members are get­

It seems that they need some 
knee sox to protect them from 
the wintry blasts they often 
find on gridirons. So they are 
asking any girls who would 
like to knit to contact Mrs. Wil­

material will be supplied, so 
that all the girls must furnish 
is the time and skill.

Scotlie Financial Status To Be 
Settled By Council Committee
Funds Alloted For Council Banquet Seen As
Possible Partial Source Of Debt Repayment
Probably the weirdest commentary on the now defunct Scottie’s 
financial status was heard last week when Councilman Bigley ob­
served “They probably have debts they haven’t even used yet,”.
The problem of liquidating the debt was finally placed on the 
shoulders of the publications*--------------------------------------------------
committee since no one was posi­
tive of the actual size of the debt.
Reports from the constitution, 
budget and social , committees 
were* the only other pieces of 
business during the short meet­
ing.
Councilman Shaffer, budget 
chairman, announced a debt of 
$125 against the Scottie for the 
present year and suggested that 
the $100 budgeted for the Council 
banquet could be used to write 
off part of the debt. “Dollars for 
banquets but not one cent for the 
Scottie” was Councilman Siegel’s 
reaction to the proposal.
Actually the debt is a great deal 
larger, as several loans have been 
made by the school to the Scottie 
in the past few years. The Scot­
tie and the school do not agree 
to the size of these loans although 
the total debt is believed to be 
between $400 and $700.
Gerry Meyers announced that
his committee had finished its 
work on the constitution and that 
it had produced a “working set of 
rules.” A revised copy of the 
constitution will be available to 
all Councilmen during the week, 
and the document will be ratified 
today. The next job of the com­
mittee is to rewrite the by-laws.
Carnegie’s Kiltie band has been 
able to enlarge its membership as 
a result of obtaining new band 
uniforms. The manufacture of 
these uniforms is the result of do­
nations of time and effort by 
wives of faculty members, as well 
as other interested women.
Mrs. Robert E. Doherty organ­
ized the volunteers and those who 
helped her include: Mrs. Schott, 
Mrs. G. Gere, Mrs. J. P. Fugassi, 
Mrs. D. Lee, Mrs. A. Gilmore,

And The Harmony Rolls Forth
Gathered around the piano are quartet members Charles Tritle, 
Ray Kondrat, and Duane Sample, with Anthony Zukasky playing as 
they rehearse for one of their many local appearances.
TX9s ‘Three Men ’/» A Tub9 
Begin Professional Career
“Three Men ’n a Tub,” as the members of the Theta Xi frater­
nity quartet now call themselves, have assumer position of musical 
laedership both on the Carnegie campus and in Pittsburgh music 
circles.
Choice of the novel name for this increasingly popular vocal
group, who specialize in old-^ 
fashioned barbershop harmony, 
including folk music and a few 
popular ballads, resulted from the 
generosity of Mother Nature with 
first tenor Charles Tritle, aptly 
tabbed “the Tub.” However, sec­
ond tenor Ray Kondrat, baritone 
Tony Zukasky, and bass Duane 
Sample, whose voices blend to­
gether with that of Tritle to pro­
vide smooth harmony and enjoy­
able listening, are lumped to­
gether as “the Three Men.” 
Professional Organization
Continuing what has become a 
fraternity tradition, the four boys 
have expanded a previously ama­
teur organization into a well-in­
tegrated professional quartet. One 
of their featured appearances in 
the Pittsburgh area was on the 
Wilkens’ Amateur hour last Sun­
day.
Other appearances include per­
formances over Radio Station 
WPGH, originally as guests of the 
Varsity show, and recently, 
through popular audience request, 
on the Dorie Weaver show. At 
present, the group is contemplat­
ing a sustaining program on that 
station. Plans for the future in­
clude an audition with Arthur 
Godfrey for his “Talent Scouts” 
program, as well as an audition 
for Meridian Films of Pittsburgh.
Except for Kondrat, who is a
the
members are all music students. 
Zukasky is a senior, and Tritle a 
sub-senior, while Sample is a 
junior. Although the quartet 
works as a team and has no desig­
nated leader, Zukasky arranges 
music for the group.
On campus the boys are all 
members of the Men’s Glee club, 
with which they frequently ap­
pear as a quartet during Glee 
club performances. In their fra­
ternity they are part of a large 
group which will represent the 
Theta Xis in Greek Sing.
Cwens Entertain 
Freshmen Eligible 
For Membership
Cwens, sophomore women’s hon­
orary, will entertain those fresh­
men eligible for membership to 
the society at a party to be given 
on Sunday, March 6, from 2 to 4 
at the Carnegie Union. Invitations 
will be sent to the women who 
meet the requirements for mem­
bership.
To be eligible for the honorary, 
a girl must maintain a 2.5 factor 
throughout her freshman year. 
Qualities of leadership and par­
ticipation in extra-curricular ac­
tivities are also used in determin­
ing membership qualifications.

to provide it. We’ve added nearly 9,000,000 new 
telephones in the past three years. Still more 
are needed and are on the way.
But that’s not all that we’ve been doing 
to increase the usefulness and value of the 
telephone.
Telephone service has been extended to auto­
mobiles, trucks, boats, trains and airplanes... 
real progress has been made in expanding and 
improving rural telephone facilities . . , wire 
and radio relay networks have been developed 
and enlarged ... research has started on new 
electronic devices which promise to bring even 
wider horizons of electrical communications 
within view.
All this means better telephone service for 
you . . . more people you can reach easily and 
quickly.. . more time in your day... a larger 
world in your grasp.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANWEDNESDAY, MARCH 2, 1949
Cagers Close Home Season Tonight
Paul Offermann’s'
To Greet Eddie Bakery
No Freshmen Squad 
To Greet Eddie Baker 
Situation Unfortunate
The other day we got into a discussion with a rabid out- 
of-town sports fan who remembers when the name Carnegie 
meant tough and spirited football teams. We paid rapt atten­
tion to his reminiscent ramblings for some time before he 
worked the subject up to date, and asked how prospects ‘‘out 
in old Sclienley Park” would be next fall with Eddie Baker 
returning.
Everything was going along nicely until :the question was 
raised, “What kind of a freshman team is coming up from 
last year for Baker to work with?” At first the kindly old 
gentleman was indignant at our answer—claimed we were 
“trying to pull his leg.” Finally we were able to put across 
the fact that Carnegie varsity, JY, and freshmen teams are 
all one-in-the-same thing, composed mostly of freshmen and 
sophomores, with a sprinkling of juniors.
This unbelieving attitude brought back to us with greater 
force than «ver that our position here at Carnegie is very 
unique—and from the standpoint of winning football, very 
unfortunate! Only ten years after covering themselves with 
glory in the Sugar Bowl, the once-mighty Tartans are unable 
to scrape up enough upperclassmen for a varsity team so that 
freshmen can be placed on a special squad, under special coach­
ing that will indoctrinate them with the playing system of the 
varsity.
The enrollment at Carnegie is certainly large enough to 
warrant varsity and freshmen teams. During the past three 
years, while the schedule and team was being rebuilt from the 
w^ar-time recess, the necessity of using freshmen in varsity 
competition was understandable. But, with the return last sea­
son of the “freshman rule” by all conferences, the post-war 
material shortage was declared over. Next fall the Plaid will 
be “loaded” with upperclassmen, but there seems to be no 
reason why freshman football shouldn’t make a comback . . . 
unless it has become a fatality of our nationally-famous* “de­
emphasis program.”
Ditto for basketball!
Reporter’s Notebook
A sad situation—Swimming Coach Claude Sofield has 
come up with one of his better swimming teams this year. 
Although the Tartan natators show only a 4-5 record, all 
indications seem to hint that the record should read 5-4. It 
seems that the one-point defeat suffered at Slippery Rock 
would have been the other way around if one of Coach 
Sofield’s swimmers could have made the trip. The missing 
swimmer’s instructor apparently balked at allowing him to 
make up some work so he could make the trip. It’s too bad 
that when you finally get a good aggregation together that 
can put the word “win” after Carnegie, faculty cooperation 
bogs down.

Marty Chetlin
Donohoe And Chetlin To Make 
Last Appearances in Skibo Gym
Plaid Hoopsters Drop Two Games In Week; 
Pitt And W&J Triumph By Wide Margins
By Bill Dorn
Two familiar figures on the local sports’ scene, Marty Chet­
lin and coach Bill Donohoe, will make their final appearances 
before the campus gentry when Carnegie’s b’asketeers take on 
an underdog Grovfc City five at the Skibo gymnasium tonight.
The hard driving Chetlin is the only playing member of the 
squad who will not return to action when the Tartans open their
?next campaign. Through four 
seasons the little barrel-chested 
guard has been a consistent per­
former for the Scots.
Donohoe Bows Out
Somewhat hampered by his 
lack of height, Chetlin developed 
into a skillful ball handler and 
fine play maker to more than off­
set his physical disadvantage. Al­
ways a tremendous competitor, he 
has been a deciding factor in a 
number of the Plaid’s seven vic­
tories this year.
For Donohoe the encounter will 
mark the end of three turbulent 
years at his alma mater. The 
glaring lack of victories in both 
football and basketball brought 
pressure to bear from sources 
both inside and outside the school 
and eventually led to his resigna­
tion last December, Now after 
having coached his quintet to 
their longest winning streak in a 
decade, he will bow out with one 
last effort against the team which 
has been his chief victim.
Plaid Streak Ends
The Grove City squad, which 
lost both ends of the home-and- 
away series last year, also fell be­
fore the Tartans in their first 
meeting during the present sea­
son. Due largely to Mike Theo­
dore’s 33-point effort, the Scots 
had little trouble with the Grov­
ers in the latter contest, rolling 
up a 71-53 score. Tonight’s en­
gagement, however, figures to be 
much closer despite the advantage 
the Tartans will gain from play­
ing on their home floor.
Dr. H. C. Carlson’s Pitt Pan­
thers thoroughly swamped the 
Plaid quintet, 76-49, last Wednes­
day on the Pitt Stadium pavilion 
to end a four-game win streak. 
The city’s leading scorer, Sammy 
David, led the Blue and Gold in 
the scoring column with 36 points 
to increase his lead over his rivals, 
teammate Dodo Canterna and 
Carnegie’s Theodore.
Take Early Lead
The Tartans broke Into an early 
lead and held a 5-0 advantage 
after the first few minutes of 
play. The Panthers, however, re­
covered quickly and erased the 
visitors’ margin to take the lead 
midway in the first quarter.
The Scots kept within striking 
distance until the closing moments 
of the first half when a sudden 
burst of field goals increased the 
Pitt lead. After the intermission, 
the Panthers were never in dan­
ger again.
Lose To Jeffs
Just three days late Washing­
ton and Jefferson’s two platoon 
system outdid the Pittmen by 
trouncing Carnegie, 64-34, at 
Washington, Pa.
Theodore in his poorest show­
ing of the year netted only 7 
points to top the Tartan scorers. 
Knoche tallied 16 for the victors.
Milers Take 
Time Trials
Track coach Guy Halferty be­
gan grooming his runners for the 
long season ahead last week with 
time trials in the mile run Satur­
day afternoon. The Tartan coach 
had also scheduled a shuttle relay 
race for 4:30 yesterday.
The large crop of distance men 
including the veteran Gene Cock­
rell, Cooper, and Button, appeared 
in fine form despite their limited 
amount of practice.
Sprint men and hurdlers headed 
by Ernie Cassler have been hard 
at work preparing for the AAU 
indoor met to be held at South 
Park March 12.
Coach Halferty, obviously 
pleased by the fine turnout, ex­
pressed optimism regarding the 
approaching season. Weight men 
Jim Trautman, Floyd Wiseman, 
Rusmak, Lange, and Holtz show 
promise of eliminating the weak­
ness that was evident in last year’s 
squad.
CIT Rifle Club 
Sponsors Matches
Carnegie’s Rifle and Pistol club 
is sponsoring a series of three 
handicap small bore rifle matches 
open to all students. Handicaps 
are set up in order to give every 
entrant an equal chance to win 
regardless of shooting ability.
Entry fee will be 75 certs for 
the three matches and must be 
paid at the range in the basement 
of Margaret Morrison before 
Monday, March 7. Actual firing 
dates will be announced later.
Cash prizes will be awarded for 
each match, and medals will be 
given to the man and woman with 
the highest aggregate score for 
the series of matches. For any ad­
ditional information contact Sgt. 
Reed at the range.
Rifle Team Loses
Carnegie Tech’s rifle team lost 
to Pitt in a close match last 
Thursday. The score of the match, 
which was the team’s first league 
encounter of the year, was 1343 
to 1371.
Future matches are scheduled 
with Duquesne for March 3.
Phi Kappa Phi
Any new members of Phi 
Kappa Phi who are interested in 
applying for the graduate fel­
lowship should get further in­
formation from Miss Stewart,
144-C Industries Hall, before 
March 10.

Sigma Nu’s crack bowling five 
rolled three victories over Delta 
Upsilon last Saturday to take the 
Spare League title away from the 
defending champion Emanon 
squad.
The fraternity team eliminated 
their opponents’ last mathematical 
chance when they closed out their 
schedule showing only one defeat 
out of 21 games. Emanon with 
three games remaining have 
dropped two, both to the cham­
pions.
Across the way an idle Theta

Penn-Oliio Sivimmers Meet 
In Championship Competition
The fifth annual Penn-Ohio Collegiate Association Swimming 
championships will be held this Saturday in the Carnegie pool.
The competing colleges will be Allegheny, Case, Edinboro, Loqk 
Haven, Slippery Rock, Washing-? 
ton and Jefferson, Westminster, 
and Carnegie.
Tartans Strong
In previous meets Westminster 
and Slippery Rock have dominat­
ed the field, but this year the Plaid 
entry is expected to provide stiff 
opposition, with strong entries in 
the medley relay, the breast 
stroke, and the 100, 220, and the 
440 yard free style events.
A win would give Coach Claude 
Sofield his second straight vic­
tory, as his Taylor Alderdice 
team took the city high school 
championship last week.
Split Two Meets
The Carnegie swimming team 
closed out dual competition last 
week by trouncing Grove City at 
home Tuesday 56-18 and bowing 
at Westminster on Saturday 36-30.
Plaid mermen flashed their best 
form of the season in taking ev­

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 2, 1949THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Editorial
On Proper Restraint
At its February meeting Evening Student Council re­
ceived a communication from the Evening Student Association 
of the University of Pittsburgh suggesting that the evening 
students of Carnegie join those from Pitt to sponsor several 
dances. The letter specifically requested our participation in 
their Spring Dance, a formal affair to be held off campus, and, 
in their words, to share in :the profit or loss. This dance is an 
annual activity at Pitt, and plans have already been made 
for it. ?
For our student council to join 
in the sponsorship would mean 
the chance of taking a loss without 
having any part in the arrange­
ments. Evening Student Council 
cannot afford to take this risk. As 
a result of their two successful 
dances this year, council has 
reached financial stability but is 
in no position to absorb another 
group’s defict. Therefore the mem­
bers of council voted, and we be­
lieve wisely, to reject this pro­
posal.
However a way was left open 
to hold joint affairs at some fu­
ture time. Our group felt that a 
smaller, on campus dance would 
be desirable, possibly next year 
when the social calendar can be 
arranged to include it. We feel 
that this is a step forward to am­
icable relations between the stu 
dents of the two schools, and as 
such it should be encouraged. But 
any activity held under joint 
sponsorship should have the bene­
fit of joint planning in order that 
the problems of both groups can

We look forward to the time 
when there will be co-operation 
between Carnegie and Pitt, but it 
will require some deep thinking 
on the part of those involved be­
fore the plan can be realized. We 
hope that the day is not far off.

Luckily it isn’t too often that 
it’s necessary to begin this column 
with a correction, but one is in 
order, so to right an erroneous 
statement that appeared last week 
in News and Views, here goes.
We stated that the square dance 
instructions would begin Satur­
day evening, March 5, and con­
tinue every Saturday evening 
thereafter. The correction is that 
instructions will be given EVERY 
OTHER Saturday evening there­
after.
Just to keep you up to date on 
the Engineer’s banquet progress 
we are informed that the letters 
soliciting souvenirs and door 
prizes have already been sent out, 
and the typing was done by 
members of Phi Gamma Pi eve 
ning school sorority. Therefore 
our hurrahs this week go to those 
co-operative gals who have been 
kind enough to donate some of 
their free time to help out the 
Engineers.
Graduate Wins Honors For 
Technical Paper On Aluminum
Metallurgical Society Awards Pettigrew First
Prize In Local And National Competitions
It is always gratifying to hear of the accomplishments of former 
evening students, for it still proves that incentive and perseverance 
eventually lead to success. Perhaps you have noticed in the local 
commercial newspapers that an evening school graduate, David W.
Pettigrew, Jr., recently won 
ble honors for his paper, “The 
Constitution of Aluminum - Rich 
Aluminum-Copper Alloys.”
The American Institute of Min­
ing and Metallurgical Engineers 
awarded him first prize in the na­
tional student competition.
His paper also won top honors 
from the Pittsburgh section of 
the AIMME.
Mr. Pettigrew is employed at 
the Aluminum Co. of America’s 
research laboratories in New Ken­
sington. He began work there in 
1937 following graduation from 
high school and completed his 
study at Carnegie Tech in night 
school.
During World War II he served 
as first lieutenant in the Army 
Signal Corps.
It isn’t necessary to go off 
campus to find those who have 
been successful in their post­
graduate work.
Former evening students Ste­
phen Marcinizyn, Edward Macha 
and Mr. Tubello are at present 
school instructors who 
are supplementing their work in 
industry with teaching of evening 
students. Mr. Tubello has been 
successful as a county engineer 
for Allegheny county.
These are just a few of the eve­
ning students who have laid the 
foundation for their success at 
Carnegie Tech evening school.

Drama Production Portraying 
Polish Family Well Received
A relationship seldom seen at playhouses was achieved between 
the audience and cast at the Carnegie Theater on opening night 
of “619, Portrait of Polish Fam-* 
ily.”
The Bulletin Board
“Portrait” was not an objective 
study of people fashioned to pro­
duce comedy, but rather a warm­
hearted commentary on the every­
day life of a Polish family. It of­
fered comedy and situations with 
which the audience could sym­
pathize and laugh.
A parallel to real life is drawn 
throughout “Portrait” when one of 
the characters talks of the play 
soon to be produced at the Uni­
versity Theatre and hopes that the 
family will come to see it.
Another note of audience-actor 
intimacy was sounded when Ma 
and Pa Zagloba left the stage and 
were found sitting out in the audi­
ence for the “Finished Portrait”; 
whereupon they recognized their 
family on the stage and finally 
went up to take their curtain calls 
with the rest of the cast.
After the cast had taken several 
curtain calls, Lloyd Weninger, the 
creator of the play, went up to 
acknowledge the thunderous ap­
plause.
