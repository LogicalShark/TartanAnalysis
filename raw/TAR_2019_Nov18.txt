Waste code update will affect renters  
Peduto talks OnePGH at CMU panel
ADAM TUNNARD
News Editor
This past month, the Pittsburgh 
City Council unanimously passed 
changes to municipal waste code 
619 that will primarily affect rent-
ers and landlords in Pittsburgh. 
The changes will go into effect 
this summer. According to the 
of?ce of Erika Strassburger, who 
spearheaded the changes, the “ul-
timate goal is to make it easier for 
people to recycle and hopefully 
increase the amount of material 
that is recycled.”
Among the changes made, 
new provisions now require 
landlords to “provide both waste 
and recycling storage containers 
for their tenants, these must be 
watertight with close ?tting lids,” 
and to provide Pittsburgh speci?c 
recycling literature “to tenants as 
part of leases,” said Moira Egler, 
Councilperson Strassburger’s 
Chief of Staff, in an interview 
with The Tartan.
In addition to these changes, 
violations of the new waste 
code will now result in notices 
being sent to both the tenant 
and landlord and the mandate to 
recycle will be made more explicit 
in the code itself.
Small recycling changes have 
been clari?ed, as stated in the 
Pittsburgh Public Works waste 
regulations website.
These include the ability 
to place recycling out in blue 
translucent bags and the 
codi?cation of set out times as 
being “no sooner than 6 p.m. the 
day prior to collection, no later 
than 6 a.m. day of collection,” and 
bin retrieval times as being “by 10 
p.m. the day of collection.”
The legislation was an effort 
made in partnership with the 
City of Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Environmental Services and with 
the of?ce of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill 
Peduto. It passed unanimously in 
the council with few amendments.
The only pushback on the 
legislation came from a collection 
of residents that raised concerns 
about the code’s initial bin retriev-
al time, which was that bins had 
to be removed from side streets 
no later than 7:00 p.m. Some 
residents, like those working 
odd hours or with afternoon and 
night shifts, would be negatively 
affected by this set time.
Addressing these concerns, the 
latest possible retrieval time was 
pushed back to 10:00 p.m. in the 
now-passed legislation. Previous-
ly, the legislation did not enforce 
a speci?ed removal time.
In response to the prospect of 
rent increases due to the mandate 
that landlords provide waste 
bins, Egler stated that the of?ce 
“[hasn’t] heard concerns” about 
such an issue, and that “the con-
tainers are pretty reasonably 
priced.” Egler then noted that the 
mandate is speci?cally for “apart-
ment buildings with ?ve and fewer 
units,” and that these changes are 
“common sense provisions that

“Numbers do not speak for 
themselves,” said Sir David 
Spiegelhalter, a world-renowned 
statistician, to a crowd of near-
ly 100 professors and students 
who had gathered in McConomy 
Auditorium to hear him speak. 
“The stories we tell, the way 
they’re packaged makes all the dif-
ference to their emotional impact.”
We are living in the age of 
data. Technology plays a bigger 
role in people’s daily lives than 
ever before, and many of society’s 
core issues can be reframed as 
statistical problems. Yet it is also 
the age of misinformation, and 
the ?eld of statistics is facing more 
challenges than ever before.
Sir David Spiegelhalter’s lec-
ture on Monday, April 22, was 
the second installment of the Ste-
phen and Joyce Fienberg memo-
rial lecture series. Stephen Fien-
berg, who died of cancer in 2016, 
was the head of the Carnegie 
Mellon statistics department. 
He was highly respected and 
in?uential in the ?eld of statistics 
for his dedication to applying 
statistics for societal good. Joyce 
Fienberg, Stephen Fienbergs’s 
wife who perished in the Tree 
of Life synagogue shooting last 
Oct., worked as a researcher 
at the Learning Research and 
Development Center at the 
University of Pittsburgh and was a 
great supporter and friend of the 
statistics department at Carnegie 
Mellon.
“Steve sets a high bar for how 
statistic are communicated,” 
said Sir David Spiegelhalter. In 
his lecture, he focused on how 
statistics are manipulated for 
sensational and persuasive means. 
Spiegelhalter serves as a chair 
at the Winton Centre for Risk 
and Evidence Communication, 
which is part of the University 
of Cambridge’s department of 
mathematics. In his career, he 
has published over 200 papers 
and written several books. He has 
spent the last decade focusing 
on the application of statistics 
to everyday life, appearing in 
numerous T.V. specials on BBC 
and CNN to discuss issues re-
lated to probability and climate 
change. In 2014, he was knighted 
for his service to medical statistics, 
but he jokes that his greatest 
achievement is an appearance on 
the game show Winter Wipeout.
Spiegelhalter explained the 
pipeline of statistical evidence. 
Initially, data is collected by 
researchers and statisticians. 
Their research is then passed on 
to journals and the commissioners 
of the research, all of whom may 
have “selection biases.” Then the 
research is turned over to the 
press of?ces “who decide what

On Saturday, a gunman 
entered a synagogue in Califor-
nia shouting anti-Semitic slurs, 
and opened ?re with an AR-15 
style gun, as reported by The New 
York Times.
The shooting left a 60 year old 
woman dead, a rabbi wounded in 
his hand, and two others injured 
by shrapnel wounds.
It occurred on the Sabbath, 
and the last day of Passover, 
a week-long holiday that 
celebrates Jewish liberation 
from slavery.
The shooting took place at 
the Chabad of Poway. Poway is 
a suburban town about 25 miles 
north of San Diego.
The shooting occurred exactly 
six months after the Tree of Life 
synagogue shooting that jarred 
Pittsburgh and the Jewish com-
munity at large on Oct. 27, 2018. 
It is the most recent in a series of 
deadly attacks in houses of wor-
ship, including the mass shoot-
ing in mosques in New Zealand 
last month and the church bomb-
ings in Sri Lanka last week.
The gunman has been 
identi?ed as John Earnest, a 
19 year old from San Diego. He 
?ed the synagogue after the 
shooting, but soon after called 
the California Highway Patrol 
to report his location and was 
apprehended.
Police are reportedly 
investigating a manifesto that 
was posted on 8chan before 
the shooting, which is ?lled 
with white nationalist conspir-
acy theories and racist slurs, as 
reported by The New York Times.
Last year, a study released 
by the Anti-Defamation League 
found a 57 percent increase in 
anti-Semitic incidents.
Jonathan Greenblatt, the 
chief executive and national 
director of the Anti-Defamation 
League, told The New York Times 
that “This was a pointed attack 
on Chabad, on the visible Jewish 
community here, and this is a 
collective attack on all Jewish 
communities — this is anti-Sem-
itism unleashed.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto 
is continuing his effort to get 
his stalled fund for social and 
sustainable action in Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, off the ground.
A panel this past Thursday 
titled “The City of Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, and Alignment with the 
Sustainable Development Goals” 
brought this discussion to Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus. Speaking 
alongside Peduto was the head 
of Heinz College in Washington, 
D.C., Amb. Sarah Mendelson, 
serving as the panel moderator, 
and panelists Leah Lizarondo, 
Heinz alum and CEO of 412Food 
Rescue, Jerry MacCleary, CEO of 
materials company Covestro, and 
Anthony Pipa, Senior Fellow at the 
Brookings Institution.
The talk was framed around 
Pittsburgh’s interpretation of the 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs): 17 markers developed 
by the U.N. as a guide for global 
growth. These goals, Peduto 
claims, align with the 10 areas 
developed by the Rockefeller 
Foundation and the City of 
Pittsburgh for the city’s 12-year 
resiliency plan. These, in turn, be-
came Peduto’s proposed OnePGH 
fund, which would funnel money 
from the city, local nonpro?ts, 
and corporations to organizations 
working toward 47 planned proj-
ects.
Peduto emphasized the 
importance of action on the 
city level, citing a “vacuum of 
leadership in Washington.” 
However, according to Peduto, 
OnePGH is neccesary because the 
City of Pittsburgh does not have 
the leverage to act on its own. 
“[The projects] can’t happen un-
der old models. Old models are 
city government,” said Peduto.
“We don’t have the capacity 
to address hunger and poverty,” 
said Peduto, “but if we create a 
separate organization that then 
helps those that are on the ground 
addressing hunger and homeless-
ness, and being able to use that 
organization to prop up the non-
pro?ts throughout the city and 
this region, then we can get to our 
goals together.”

Pittsburgh sits on the Marcellus 
Shale, one of the largest deposits 
of natural gas in the United 
States. This past Wednesday, 
President Trump delivered the 
keynote address at Shale Insight, 
a conference hosted by the 
Marcellus Shale Coalition, the 
Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and 
the West Virginia Oil and Natural 
Gas Association. 
This marks his second visit to 
the region in the past months, 
after his Aug. rally at the Shell 
cracker plant in Beaver County.
The Shale Insights conference 
was attended largely by those 
working in natural gas. In his 
remarks, Trump emphasized his 
support for the industry, citing 
the rollback of environmental 
regulations and withdrawal from 
the Paris Climate Accords. 
The keynote address was 
open to the public, with a section 
cordoned off to create space for 
a rally in the back, and Trump 
addressed some of the activat-
ing issues for his supporters, 
including re-upping his claim that 
he is working for “Pittsburgh, not 
Paris.”
Indigenous activists and anti-
fracking groups gathered at 
Point State Park and held a water 
ceremony in the Ohio River before 
marching into downtown for a 
second Defend the Water rally 
in protest of the conference. The 
rally was intended to “address 
the destructive impacts of the 
petrochemical industry build-
out in the Ohio River Valley 
and beyond on people and the 
environment,” according to the 
website of Breath Project, one of 
the rally’s co-organizers.
The protests expanded beyond 
an opposition to fracking, many 
focusing on Trump himself. 14 
protesters, holding a sign that 
read “Our solidarity will defeat 
white nationalism,” were arrested 
for blocking a ramp from the Fort 
Pitt Bridge near the convention 
center where the conference was 
being held.

During the ?rst-ever Tartan 
Community Day, students 
attended a presentation on the 
results of a multi-year study on 
personal well-being among the 
Carnegie Mellon student body, 
gathering together and enjoying 
ice cream sandwiches in the 
Rangos Ballroom. The presen-
tation was given by David Cre-
swell, a professor in Dietrich 
College’s psychology department 
and principal investigator for the 
project they call Life@CMU.
“This project is so distinctly 
CMU,” President Jahanian stated, 
describing the project as being 
centered on science and data 
analytics to improve student 
wellbeing. “The Life@CMU 
study illuminates the nuanced 
ecosystem of individuals, 
traditions, culture, that make up 
our community. It has allowed 
us to better understand the CMU 
experience and draw on the data 
that’s collected to in?uence our 
interventions, programs, and 
resources.”
Concluding his introductory 
statement, Jahanian added, “I 
want all of you to know that no 
one is immune to feeling alone 
or vulnerable at times… not even 
your president. But in moments of 
uncertainty we must remember 
that we are a community. There is 
an incredible network of support 
that surrounds us. Use it. Lean 
on one another. This is one of the 
most profound ways in which we 
can act as a community and also 
thrive as individuals.”
Creswell described the 
goals of the project as an at-
tempt to “better understand the 
culture at Carnegie Mellon, the 
stress culture… we wanted to 
understand stress, we wanted 
to understand mental health 
and sleep patterns here in our 
students so we can better help our 
students, with their health and 
academic success.”
Before going into the Carnegie 
Mellon-speci?c results, Creswell 
provided context for the grow-
ing mental health problems 
in our broader society. As an 
example, he pointed to ?ndings 
from a study that tracked mental 
health outcomes of a nationally 
representative sample of people 
in the U.S. that found there was 
a 50 percent increase in ma-
jor depression diagnoses from 
2009 to 2017 among younger 
Americans.
Phase I of the Life@CMU 
project followed a sample of ?rst-
year students over the course of 
the 2017 spring semester. The 
following spring Phase II tracked 
?rst-year and sophomore students 
over the semester as well. They 
were able to track 85 students 
who participated in both phases 
to examine their transition from 
being ?rst-years to sophomores.
They gathered data on factors 
of students’ well-being and

“She was one of those students 
who was smarter than the teacher, 
and the teacher knew it but 
wouldn’t say it out loud,” confessed 
Jim Daniels, English Professor 
at Carnegie Mellon and former 
teacher of author Sarah Valentine. 
Daniels showered Valentine with 
praise before her MLK Jr. Day 
Writing Awards speech on her life 
story and autobiographical book, 
When I Was White: A Memoir.
During her time at Carnegie 
Mellon, Valentine was a part of 
the English Department and the 
Modern Languages department, 
where she studied Russian as an 
undergraduate. She graduated in 
2000.
Valentine’s speech was held last 
Thursday in the Center for Student 
Diversity and Inclusion. Setting 
the stage for Valentine’s speech, 
M. Shernell Smith, Associate 
Director at the Of?ce of the Dean 
of Student Affairs, said, “there are 
times in this room where you really 
don’t know who’s who. It’s good 
because we can create this sense of 
connection.”
“I graduated almost 20 years 
ago, and it’s great to see how much 
the university has grown in terms 
of its engagement with diversity. 
Even then, the English department 
was ahead of the curve. The MLK 
writing awards program started 
when I was a student,” Valentine 
said.
Valentine thanked Daniels for 
his praise. She also thanked him 
for being an important mentor to 
her at Carnegie Mellon. Much of 
her speech and memoirs from her 
book focused on her senior year at 
Carnegie Mellon.
When I Was White and the 
speech she gave at the MLK writing 
awards focused on Valentine’s 
struggles with racial identity 
throughout her life. Raised in an 
Irish-Italian household by her 
biological mother’s family and 
stepdad, Valentine was expected to 
conform to her European identity 
by her mother and was unaware 
that her father was a black man. 
Valentine has had to grapple with 
her African-American identity 
after believing she was white 
growing up.
Recounting a Saint Patrick’s 
day festival from her college years, 
Valentine said she told her friends 
that she was Irish, to which they 
responded, “Yeah, everyone’s Irish 
on Saint Patrick’s day!” Valentine 
told the audience that, though her 
friends saw her as other, she felt 
connected to her Irish identity, 
and she was terri?ed to confront 
this difference she had with her 
friends.
Valentine also told the 
audience about how she stole an 
Irish heritage ring from a vendor 
at the festival, later tossing it 
on the ground out of guilt and 
abandoning it. A guard searched 
her to no avail when she was re-
ported for it, and Valentine told the 
crowd that her friends thought she 
was being racially pro?led.
Valentine wanted to confess 
about the ring badly, and she 
?nally got her chance in Daniels’ 
poetry class where she got to write 
about the incident. She joyfully 
recalled her time as a student with 
Daniels.
“Jim showed me what it was 
like to be a poet in real life. He was 
such a regular guy,” Valentine said, 
laughing. “That’s a good thing. He 
was a family man, no one crazy, 
who was able to show me he could 
be a good writer. It let me know 
I could be myself and be a good 
writer.”
Valentine also told the 
audience a few heart-wrenching 
anecdotes from her childhood. 
She commented on how she 
was expected to look and act 
white, and one aspect of this was 
straightening her hair. Once her 
mother ironed her hair, painfully 
burning her scalp.
“I ended up admiring the white 
girls at my school for their hair. 
I fell into the role of the well-
behaved, well-groomed daughter 
to satisfy my parents and other 
adults. I felt like I was in a struggle 
to please people as a little girl and 
be myself at the same time.”
“White people had been asking 
me questions about my identity 
my whole life and accepted 
whatever answer I gave them. I was 
constantly questioned about my 
hair, family, and ethnicity. I had few 
black people in her life, and I felt as 
though I’d been hiding behind my 
whiteness,” said Valentine.
During the Q&A session, 
Valentine revealed to the audience 
that she has yet to ?gure out who 
her biological father is. “I had 
searched before but decided to 
suspend the search because of 
how much energy it took. I came to 
accept that I didn’t need someone 
else to validate who I was. I’m still 
interested, but it’s not something I 
need to know to move on with my 
life.”
Many of Valentine’s friends 
and family were in the audience, 
and they mentioned that talk-
ing about Valentine’s dad during 
her childhood was very much off 
limits. Valentine described her 
current relationship with her mom 
as being a “truce,” and she says she 
has forgiven her parents, who now 
recognize her African-American 
identity.
After Valentine’s speech, 
Daniels talked with The Tartan 
about his time as Valentine’s 
teacher. From 1998 to 2000, 
Valentine was in every one of 
Daniels’ poetry workshops. She 
also participated in a mentoring 
program Daniels did with high 
school students at the Pittsburgh 
High School for the Creative and 
Performing Arts.
“In class, she wasn’t the stu-
dent who spoke the most, but 
when she spoke, she was able to 
read the subtleties and nuances 
of poems with amazing depth and 
insight. She had a warmth and 
generosity of spirit that set the 
tone for the class and allowed the 
other students to be both frank 
and empathetic with each other,” 
Daniels said.
“When I ?rst read When I Was 
White, I found myself underlining 
and starring passages just like I 
did when she was my student. On 
a sentence-by-sentence level, her 
writing really sings. It’s not just 
the unusual, provocative story she 
has to tell, but the skillful way that 
she tells it that makes the book so 
special.”
Sarah Valentine, author and Carnegie Mellon alumna from the class of 2000, reads from her new memoir in the Cohon Center.

Waste code update will affect renters  
Peduto talks OnePGH at CMU panel
ADAM TUNNARD
News Editor
This past month, the Pittsburgh 
City Council unanimously passed 
changes to municipal waste code 
619 that will primarily affect rent-
ers and landlords in Pittsburgh. 
The changes will go into effect 
this summer. According to the 
of?ce of Erika Strassburger, who 
spearheaded the changes, the “ul-
timate goal is to make it easier for 
people to recycle and hopefully 
increase the amount of material 
that is recycled.”
Among the changes made, 
new provisions now require 
landlords to “provide both waste 
and recycling storage containers 
for their tenants, these must be 
watertight with close ?tting lids,” 
and to provide Pittsburgh speci?c 
recycling literature “to tenants as 
part of leases,” said Moira Egler, 
Councilperson Strassburger’s 
Chief of Staff, in an interview 
with The Tartan.
In addition to these changes, 
violations of the new waste 
code will now result in notices 
being sent to both the tenant 
and landlord and the mandate to 
recycle will be made more explicit 
in the code itself.
Small recycling changes have 
been clari?ed, as stated in the 
Pittsburgh Public Works waste 
regulations website.
These include the ability 
to place recycling out in blue 
translucent bags and the 
codi?cation of set out times as 
being “no sooner than 6 p.m. the 
day prior to collection, no later 
than 6 a.m. day of collection,” and 
bin retrieval times as being “by 10 
p.m. the day of collection.”
The legislation was an effort 
made in partnership with the 
City of Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Environmental Services and with 
the of?ce of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill 
Peduto. It passed unanimously in 
the council with few amendments.
The only pushback on the 
legislation came from a collection 
of residents that raised concerns 
about the code’s initial bin retriev-
al time, which was that bins had 
to be removed from side streets 
no later than 7:00 p.m. Some 
residents, like those working 
odd hours or with afternoon and 
night shifts, would be negatively 
affected by this set time.
Addressing these concerns, the 
latest possible retrieval time was 
pushed back to 10:00 p.m. in the 
now-passed legislation. Previous-
ly, the legislation did not enforce 
a speci?ed removal time.
In response to the prospect of 
rent increases due to the mandate 
that landlords provide waste 
bins, Egler stated that the of?ce 
“[hasn’t] heard concerns” about 
such an issue, and that “the con-
tainers are pretty reasonably 
priced.” Egler then noted that the 
mandate is speci?cally for “apart-
ment buildings with ?ve and fewer 
units,” and that these changes are 
“common sense provisions that

“Numbers do not speak for 
themselves,” said Sir David 
Spiegelhalter, a world-renowned 
statistician, to a crowd of near-
ly 100 professors and students 
who had gathered in McConomy 
Auditorium to hear him speak. 
“The stories we tell, the way 
they’re packaged makes all the dif-
ference to their emotional impact.”
We are living in the age of 
data. Technology plays a bigger 
role in people’s daily lives than 
ever before, and many of society’s 
core issues can be reframed as 
statistical problems. Yet it is also 
the age of misinformation, and 
the ?eld of statistics is facing more 
challenges than ever before.
Sir David Spiegelhalter’s lec-
ture on Monday, April 22, was 
the second installment of the Ste-
phen and Joyce Fienberg memo-
rial lecture series. Stephen Fien-
berg, who died of cancer in 2016, 
was the head of the Carnegie 
Mellon statistics department. 
He was highly respected and 
in?uential in the ?eld of statistics 
for his dedication to applying 
statistics for societal good. Joyce 
Fienberg, Stephen Fienbergs’s 
wife who perished in the Tree 
of Life synagogue shooting last 
Oct., worked as a researcher 
at the Learning Research and 
Development Center at the 
University of Pittsburgh and was a 
great supporter and friend of the 
statistics department at Carnegie 
Mellon.
“Steve sets a high bar for how 
statistic are communicated,” 
said Sir David Spiegelhalter. In 
his lecture, he focused on how 
statistics are manipulated for 
sensational and persuasive means. 
Spiegelhalter serves as a chair 
at the Winton Centre for Risk 
and Evidence Communication, 
which is part of the University 
of Cambridge’s department of 
mathematics. In his career, he 
has published over 200 papers 
and written several books. He has 
spent the last decade focusing 
on the application of statistics 
to everyday life, appearing in 
numerous T.V. specials on BBC 
and CNN to discuss issues re-
lated to probability and climate 
change. In 2014, he was knighted 
for his service to medical statistics, 
but he jokes that his greatest 
achievement is an appearance on 
the game show Winter Wipeout.
Spiegelhalter explained the 
pipeline of statistical evidence. 
Initially, data is collected by 
researchers and statisticians. 
Their research is then passed on 
to journals and the commissioners 
of the research, all of whom may 
have “selection biases.” Then the 
research is turned over to the

On Saturday, a gunman 
entered a synagogue in Califor-
nia shouting anti-Semitic slurs, 
and opened ?re with an AR-15 
style gun, as reported by The New 
York Times.
The shooting left a 60 year old 
woman dead, a rabbi wounded in 
his hand, and two others injured 
by shrapnel wounds.
It occurred on the Sabbath, 
and the last day of Passover, 
a week-long holiday that 
celebrates Jewish liberation 
from slavery.
The shooting took place at 
the Chabad of Poway. Poway is 
a suburban town about 25 miles 
north of San Diego.
The shooting occurred exactly 
six months after the Tree of Life 
synagogue shooting that jarred 
Pittsburgh and the Jewish com-
munity at large on Oct. 27, 2018. 
It is the most recent in a series of 
deadly attacks in houses of wor-
ship, including the mass shoot-
ing in mosques in New Zealand 
last month and the church bomb-
ings in Sri Lanka last week.
The gunman has been 
identi?ed as John Earnest, a 
19 year old from San Diego. He 
?ed the synagogue after the 
shooting, but soon after called 
the California Highway Patrol 
to report his location and was 
apprehended.
Police are reportedly 
investigating a manifesto that 
was posted on 8chan before 
the shooting, which is ?lled 
with white nationalist conspir-
acy theories and racist slurs, as 
reported by The New York Times.
Last year, a study released 
by the Anti-Defamation League 
found a 57 percent increase in 
anti-Semitic incidents.
Jonathan Greenblatt, the 
chief executive and national 
director of the Anti-Defamation 
League, told The New York Times 
that “This was a pointed attack 
on Chabad, on the visible Jewish 
community here, and this is a 
collective attack on all Jewish 
communities — this is anti-Sem-
itism unleashed.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto 
is continuing his effort to get 
his stalled fund for social and 
sustainable action in Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, off the ground.
A panel this past Thursday 
titled “The City of Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, and Alignment with the 
Sustainable Development Goals” 
brought this discussion to Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus. Speaking 
alongside Peduto was the head 
of Heinz College in Washington, 
D.C., Amb. Sarah Mendelson, 
serving as the panel moderator, 
and panelists Leah Lizarondo, 
Heinz alum and CEO of 412Food 
Rescue, Jerry MacCleary, CEO of 
materials company Covestro, and 
Anthony Pipa, Senior Fellow at the 
Brookings Institution.
The talk was framed around 
Pittsburgh’s interpretation of the 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs): 17 markers developed 
by the U.N. as a guide for global 
growth. These goals, Peduto 
claims, align with the 10 areas 
developed by the Rockefeller 
Foundation and the City of 
Pittsburgh for the city’s 12-year 
resiliency plan. These, in turn, be-
came Peduto’s proposed OnePGH 
fund, which would funnel money 
from the city, local nonpro?ts, 
and corporations to organizations 
working toward 47 planned proj-
ects.
Peduto emphasized the 
importance of action on the 
city level, citing a “vacuum of 
leadership in Washington.” 
However, according to Peduto, 
OnePGH is neccesary because the 
City of Pittsburgh does not have 
the leverage to act on its own. 
“[The projects] can’t happen un-
der old models. Old models are 
city government,” said Peduto.
“We don’t have the capacity 
to address hunger and poverty,” 
said Peduto, “but if we create a 
separate organization that then 
helps those that are on the ground 
addressing hunger and homeless-
ness, and being able to use that 
organization to prop up the non-
pro?ts throughout the city and 
this region, then we can get to our 
goals together.”

Pittsburgh sits on the Marcellus 
Shale, one of the largest deposits 
of natural gas in the United 
States. This past Wednesday, 
President Trump delivered the 
keynote address at Shale Insight, 
a conference hosted by the 
Marcellus Shale Coalition, the 
Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and 
the West Virginia Oil and Natural 
Gas Association. 
This marks his second visit to 
the region in the past months, 
after his Aug. rally at the Shell 
cracker plant in Beaver County.
The Shale Insights conference 
was attended largely by those 
working in natural gas. In his 
remarks, Trump emphasized his 
support for the industry, citing 
the rollback of environmental 
regulations and withdrawal from 
the Paris Climate Accords. 
The keynote address was 
open to the public, with a section 
cordoned off to create space for 
a rally in the back, and Trump 
addressed some of the activat-
ing issues for his supporters, 
including re-upping his claim that 
he is working for “Pittsburgh, not 
Paris.”
Indigenous activists and anti-
fracking groups gathered at 
Point State Park and held a water 
ceremony in the Ohio River before 
marching into downtown for a 
second Defend the Water rally 
in protest of the conference. The 
rally was intended to “address 
the destructive impacts of the 
petrochemical industry build-
out in the Ohio River Valley 
and beyond on people and the 
environment,” according to the 
website of Breath Project, one of 
the rally’s co-organizers.
The protests expanded beyond 
an opposition to fracking, many 
focusing on Trump himself. 14 
protesters, holding a sign that 
read “Our solidarity will defeat 
white nationalism,” were arrested 
for blocking a ramp from the Fort 
Pitt Bridge near the convention 
center where the conference was 
being held.

During the ?rst-ever Tartan 
Community Day, students 
attended a presentation on the 
results of a multi-year study on 
personal well-being among the 
Carnegie Mellon student body, 
gathering together and enjoying 
ice cream sandwiches in the 
Rangos Ballroom. The presen-
tation was given by David Cre-
swell, a professor in Dietrich 
College’s psychology department 
and principal investigator for the 
project they call Life@CMU.
“This project is so distinctly 
CMU,” President Jahanian stated, 
describing the project as being 
centered on science and data 
analytics to improve student 
wellbeing. “The Life@CMU 
study illuminates the nuanced 
ecosystem of individuals, 
traditions, culture, that make up 
our community. It has allowed 
us to better understand the CMU 
experience and draw on the data 
that’s collected to in?uence our 
interventions, programs, and 
resources.”
Concluding his introductory 
statement, Jahanian added, “I 
want all of you to know that no 
one is immune to feeling alone 
or vulnerable at times… not even 
your president. But in moments of 
uncertainty we must remember 
that we are a community. There is 
an incredible network of support 
that surrounds us. Use it. Lean 
on one another. This is one of the 
most profound ways in which we 
can act as a community and also 
thrive as individuals.”
Creswell described the 
goals of the project as an at-
tempt to “better understand the 
culture at Carnegie Mellon, the 
stress culture… we wanted to 
understand stress, we wanted 
to understand mental health 
and sleep patterns here in our 
students so we can better help our 
students, with their health and 
academic success.”
Before going into the Carnegie 
Mellon-speci?c results, Creswell 
provided context for the grow-
ing mental health problems 
in our broader society. As an 
example, he pointed to ?ndings 
from a study that tracked mental 
health outcomes of a nationally 
representative sample of people 
in the U.S. that found there was 
a 50 percent increase in ma-
jor depression diagnoses from 
2009 to 2017 among younger 
Americans.
Phase I of the Life@CMU 
project followed a sample of ?rst-
year students over the course of 
the 2017 spring semester. The 
following spring Phase II tracked 
?rst-year and sophomore students 
over the semester as well. They 
were able to track 85 students 
who participated in both phases 
to examine their transition from 
being ?rst-years to sophomores.
They gathered data on factors 
of students’ well-being and

“She was one of those students 
who was smarter than the teacher, 
and the teacher knew it but 
wouldn’t say it out loud,” confessed 
Jim Daniels, English Professor 
at Carnegie Mellon and former 
teacher of author Sarah Valentine. 
Daniels showered Valentine with 
praise before her MLK Jr. Day 
Writing Awards speech on her life 
story and autobiographical book, 
When I Was White: A Memoir.
During her time at Carnegie 
Mellon, Valentine was a part of 
the English Department and the 
Modern Languages department, 
where she studied Russian as an 
undergraduate. She graduated in 
2000.
Valentine’s speech was held last 
Thursday in the Center for Student 
Diversity and Inclusion. Setting 
the stage for Valentine’s speech, 
M. Shernell Smith, Associate 
Director at the Of?ce of the Dean 
of Student Affairs, said, “there are 
times in this room where you really 
don’t know who’s who. It’s good 
because we can create this sense of 
connection.”
“I graduated almost 20 years 
ago, and it’s great to see how much 
the university has grown in terms 
of its engagement with diversity. 
Even then, the English department 
was ahead of the curve. The MLK 
writing awards program started 
when I was a student,” Valentine 
said.
Valentine thanked Daniels for 
his praise. She also thanked him 
for being an important mentor to 
her at Carnegie Mellon. Much of 
her speech and memoirs from her 
book focused on her senior year at 
Carnegie Mellon.
When I Was White and the 
speech she gave at the MLK writing 
awards focused on Valentine’s 
struggles with racial identity 
throughout her life. Raised in an 
Irish-Italian household by her 
biological mother’s family and 
stepdad, Valentine was expected to 
conform to her European identity 
by her mother and was unaware 
that her father was a black man. 
Valentine has had to grapple with 
her African-American identity 
after believing she was white 
growing up.
Recounting a Saint Patrick’s 
day festival from her college years, 
Valentine said she told her friends 
that she was Irish, to which they 
responded, “Yeah, everyone’s Irish 
on Saint Patrick’s day!” Valentine 
told the audience that, though her 
friends saw her as other, she felt 
connected to her Irish identity, 
and she was terri?ed to confront 
this difference she had with her 
friends.
Valentine also told the 
audience about how she stole an 
Irish heritage ring from a vendor 
at the festival, later tossing it 
on the ground out of guilt and 
abandoning it. A guard searched 
her to no avail when she was re-
ported for it, and Valentine told the 
crowd that her friends thought she 
was being racially pro?led.
Valentine wanted to confess 
about the ring badly, and she 
?nally got her chance in Daniels’ 
poetry class where she got to write 
about the incident. She joyfully 
recalled her time as a student with 
Daniels.
“Jim showed me what it was 
like to be a poet in real life. He was 
such a regular guy,” Valentine said, 
laughing. “That’s a good thing. He 
was a family man, no one crazy, 
who was able to show me he could 
be a good writer. It let me know 
I could be myself and be a good 
writer.”
Valentine also told the 
audience a few heart-wrenching 
anecdotes from her childhood. 
She commented on how she 
was expected to look and act 
white, and one aspect of this was 
straightening her hair. Once her 
mother ironed her hair, painfully 
burning her scalp.
“I ended up admiring the white 
girls at my school for their hair. 
I fell into the role of the well-
behaved, well-groomed daughter 
to satisfy my parents and other 
adults. I felt like I was in a struggle 
to please people as a little girl and 
be myself at the same time.”
“White people had been asking 
me questions about my identity 
my whole life and accepted 
whatever answer I gave them. I was 
constantly questioned about my 
hair, family, and ethnicity. I had few 
black people in her life, and I felt as 
though I’d been hiding behind my 
whiteness,” said Valentine.
During the Q&A session, 
Valentine revealed to the audience 
that she has yet to ?gure out who 
her biological father is. “I had 
searched before but decided to 
suspend the search because of 
how much energy it took. I came to 
accept that I didn’t need someone 
else to validate who I was. I’m still 
interested, but it’s not something I 
need to know to move on with my 
life.”
Many of Valentine’s friends 
and family were in the audience, 
and they mentioned that talk-
ing about Valentine’s dad during 
her childhood was very much off 
limits. Valentine described her 
current relationship with her mom 
as being a “truce,” and she says she 
has forgiven her parents, who now 
recognize her African-American 
identity.
After Valentine’s speech, 
Daniels talked with The Tartan 
about his time as Valentine’s 
teacher. From 1998 to 2000, 
Valentine was in every one of 
Daniels’ poetry workshops. She 
also participated in a mentoring 
program Daniels did with high 
school students at the Pittsburgh 
High School for the Creative and 
Performing Arts.
“In class, she wasn’t the stu-
dent who spoke the most, but 
when she spoke, she was able to 
read the subtleties and nuances 
of poems with amazing depth and 
insight. She had a warmth and 
generosity of spirit that set the 
tone for the class and allowed the 
other students to be both frank 
and empathetic with each other,” 
Daniels said.
“When I ?rst read When I Was 
White, I found myself underlining 
and starring passages just like I 
did when she was my student. On 
a sentence-by-sentence level, her 
writing really sings. It’s not just 
the unusual, provocative story she 
has to tell, but the skillful way that 
she tells it that makes the book so 
special.”
Sarah Valentine, author and Carnegie Mellon alumna from the class of 2000, reads from her new memoir in the Cohon Center.

Northrop Grumman to fund AI research though new CMU agreement
Sensors@CMU: Doorway KinectsPolice host forum about using race in crime alerts
SUJAY UTKARSH
Pillbox Editor
Last Monday, Carnegie 
Mellon’s vice president for op-
erations, Rodney P. McClendon, 
and the Carnegie Mellon police 
department hosted a discussion 
forum on the content of campus 
alerts. The discussion focused 
speci?cally on whether race 
should be included in the suspect 
description of Carnegie Mellon’s 
crime and safety alerts.
Carnegie Mellon crime alerts 
get sent out when some crimes 
occur on campus, or when 
crimes directly target individuals 
af?liated with the university. 
A safety alert is for crimes that 
occur off-campus where Carnegie 
Mellon students may live. The 
content of these alerts includes 
the location and time, a descrip-
tion of the crime, a description 
of the suspect, and a general 
warning of precaution.
In 2016, the Carnegie Mellon 
police department removed the 
race of the suspect from descrip-
tions, following feedback from 
faculty and students. However, by 
2018, the move received pushback 
from some members of the 
community, who requested the 
policy be reverted. That pushback 
prompted last week’s forum.
David Touretzky, a computer 
science professor at Carnegie 
Mellon, spoke against the deci-
sion to remove race descriptions, 
citing transparency and safety 
as his primary concerns. In his 
remarks, he described how some 
crime alerts cite the color of a car 
that was used in a crime, but not 
the color of the person, a policy 
that he found “silly.”
He also compared the police 
report of one crime to the crime 
alert released shortly after, noting 
that the police report maintains 
the race of the suspect. “Does 
CMU want to catch this guy or 
not?” he posed to the audience.
From his point of view, he saw 
the removal of race descriptions 
as sending a message that the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
“can’t handle the truth 
about race...can’t handle the 
information responsibly” and that 
the community “is not entitled to 
the truth.”
In his remarks, Carnegie 
Mellon Police Chief Thomas 
Ogden made key distinctions 
concerning the policy. He stressed 
that crime and safety alerts are 
only meant to inform the com-
munity about a crime, where it 
happened, and to take precau-
tions. “In my 41 years of law 
enforcement experience, we 
haven’t caught anyone, in my ex-
perience, based on a crime alert or 
a community alert.” In a follow-up 
comment with The Tartan, he said 
that the alerts do not function as a 
tip line either.
Another distinction Ogden 
made is the unreliability of witness 
accounts. “Statistically speaking, 
eyewitness identi?cation most of 
the time is not accurate because 
the people providing it were in the 
heat of the moment.” He acknowl-
edged that there is confusion over 
the crime alert policies, as there 
is no national or local consistency 
regarding racial descriptions of 
suspects.
Once the ?oor was opened 
to the audience for discussion, 
the overwhelming majority of 
the speakers spoke in favor of 
continuing the 2016 policy, with 
some advocating to remove 
suspect descriptions entirely.
The majority of the focus 
from the speakers, ranging from 
students to Carnegie Mellon 
professors, focused on the impact 
that including racial descriptions 
has on pro?ling.
One graduate student, who 
has been at Carnegie Mellon 
since 2013, quoted past examples 
of crime alerts that included 
racial descriptions. When the 
suspects were black, she said, 
black students on campus would 
“joke all the time like ‘Have you 
seen the crime alert? It was you 
this time wasn’t it?’ Because it all 
sounded like us.”

Last month, Carnegie Mellon 
and Northrop Grumman signed a 
new master research agreement 
that will better allow the aerospace 
and defense company to kick start 
university research projects. The 
agreement launched ?ve initial 
projects with the intent to aid in 
natural disaster response situa-
tions, but as stated by company 
representatives, the eventual 
application of Carnegie Mellon-
developed technologies could be 
further reaching.
In an interview with The 
Tartan, Karen Metzler, strategic 
director at Northrop Grumman, 
said that the initial ?ve projects 
address “core technolog[ies] that 
could be applied to a number of 
different applications.” She noted 
that the projects are “focused 
around solving the hard technical 
problems… that technical problem 
may reside in other domains, in 
other applications as well.”
The projects fall under an 
initiative Northrop Grumman is 
dubbing “Strategic, Operational 
and Tactical Emergency Recovery 
through Innovations in AI,” or 
SOTERIA. Each project seeks to 
address a different facet of natural 
disaster response through applying 
a range of technologies.
SOTERIA includes CyLab 
Senior Systems Scientist Yang 
Cai’s “Learning-On-The-Fly Video 
Analytics on Small UAVs for Rescue 
and Recovery,” professor of robot-
ics Howie Choset’s “Heterogeneous 
Multi-Search for Signs of Life: 
Ergodic Coverage,” assistant pro-
fessor of Computer Science Graham 
Neubig’s “Situational Awareness 
Data Description Language and 
Explorer (SADDLE),” professor of 
robotics Katia Sycara’s “Interactive 
Dialogue for Human and Robot,” 
and ECE professor Carlee Joe-
Wong’s “Enabling Intelligent 
Communication for Disaster 
Response.”
According to the project’s writ-
ten objective, Sycara’s “Interactive 
Dialogue for Human and Robot” 
seeks to improve communication 
between humans and robots by 
using machine learning techniques 
to send “directed/focused infor-
mation,” rather than a stream of 
all robot sensor readings, back 
to human operators. Though the 
project’s listed intent is to improve 
robot and human communication 
in a disaster relief setting, Northrop 
Grumman has other potential uses 
in mind.
“Katia’s research is critical 
for war?ghters to use on the 
battle?eld,” said Erin Cherry, 
program manager for advanced 
intelligent systems at Northrop 
Grumman, in a statement to The 
Tartan. Cherry continued, “A 
fundamental contribution that 
robotic teams can provide to the 
war?ghter is situation awareness.” 
This research is important for 
the future of robot sensory 
transmission because battle?eld 
scenarios, like natural disaster 
response, present communication 
limitations, said Cherry.
Choset’s “Multi-Search for Signs 
of Life” project focuses on “deploy-
ing as many robots as available and 
combining their different motion 
capabilities (e.g. ?ying, ground, 
amphibious, etc.) and sensing 
modalities (e.g. camera, heat 
sensors, etc.) to search [for signs 
of life] faster.” Cherry says that 
this project’s applications “are very 
broad beyond disaster recovery, to

For many years, Carnegie 
Mellon University has employed 
the use of sensors on campus for 
different reasons, ranging from 
sensing the emotions of passersby 
to gauging attention in lectures. 
In other cases, sensors have been 
used to track foot traf?c in certain 
areas of campus.
Several Xbox One Kinect 
Sensors have been installed above 
doorways across campus. Whether 
they’re above the entrance to 
Wiegand Gym or the entrance to 
certain restrooms or labs, the sen-
sors collect information about foot 
traf?c in the building.
These sensors are part of an 
ongoing research project led by  
Mario Bergés, assistant professor 
of Civil and Environmental 
Engineering. As told to The Tartan 
in an email, Bergés is “interested 
in making our built environment 
more operationally ef?cient 
and robust through the use of 
information and communication 
technologies.”
He hopes that, through 
the use of these sensors, the 
university “can better deal with 
future resource constraints and a 
changing environment.” Currently, 
his work hones in on “developing 
approximate inference techniques 
to extract useful information 
from sensor data coming from 
civil infrastructure systems, with 
a particular focus on buildings and 
energy ef?ciency.”
Bergés’ research anchors 
on how sensors can help our 
community, he says. So how could 
these sensors help the Carnegie 
Mellon community? What purpose 
would the data on the number 
of people entering the gym and 
bathrooms serve? Bergés says 
“the sensors are part of an ongo-
ing research project to investigate 
how much energy savings could 
be achieved if the heating, ven-
tilation and air conditioning 
were controlled in accordance to 
the occupancy of the room and 
thermal comfort preference of the 
occupants in it.”
However, if the sensors are 
being used for data on temperature 
control, then why are there 
cameras in the sensors? Bergés 
explained that, “These are not 
regular cameras, but rather depth 
imaging sensors.”
A Microsoft Kinect sensor is seen mounted above a women’s bathroom in the CUC. The sensors are part of an ongoing research project.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Billionaires’ contribution to the American Dream
Although billionaires are 
largely revered in the U.S., their 
societal value and power over 
politics are far greater than they 
have any right to be. The latest 
example is Michael Bloomberg, 
whose rumored announcement 
of his presidential candidacy 
has created further uncertainty 
in an already crowded field of 
Democratic candidates after 
the first candidates started 
dropping out.
Let’s back up and assume 
that the upper class isn’t getting 
enough credit. Maybe they’re 
prime examples of the American 
Dream, hard workers who have 
pulled themselves up by the 
bootstraps to create thriving 
businesses and give others the 
opportunity to also make it to 
the top.
However, this notion of 
the American Dream is a 
myth perpetuated by the top 
one percent, in an attempt to 
continue duping the middle and 
lower class into believing class 
mobility is far more real than 
it actually is. More insidiously, 
it’s a method of control: a way 
to prevent collective action 
from taking place by promoting 
rugged individualism over all 
else.
Let’s start with class mobility: 
the biggest lie capitalists try 
to sell when talking about 
markets. That’s not to say 
mobility isn’t possible; it is, but 
it’s significantly more difficult 
without any policy to promote 
it. Billionaires exemplify the 
ways that markets are great at 
generating wealth, but not at 
distributing it. The “trickle-
down economics” theory was 
used to justify tax cuts and 
deregulation for corporations 
and the wealthy during the 
Reagan era. Its legacy is wealth 
inequality — which we’re seeing 
at the highest rates since the 
Great Depression — a financial 
crisis, stagnant wages, and 
colossal debt.
In the U.S., the idea of wealth 
redistribution through taxes 
or any methods other than 
individual charity is denounced 
as socialism. Redistribution is 
not a socialist idea, and it’s not 
even that revolutionary. It’s 
based upon the idea of a social 
contract that each member 
owes to a governing body and 
each other. If the majority 
were guaranteed access to 
basic needs, they would have a 
chance to actually gain wealth 
and provide for themselves, 
without having to work more 
than 40 hours per week. Wealth 
redistribution policies account 
for the fact that most people 
don’t “make it,” particularly 
those in the lower class.
We could keep going on 
about the myths that the top one 
percent like to sell to promote a 
rigid class structure. All those 
myths are a major reason why 
wealth is so concentrated in 
the hands of so few people, 
who have an extraordinary 
influence on the direction of the 
country. This is one of the few 
times that the infamous “both 
sides” argument enlightened 
centrists tout is actually valid. 
Republicans have always been 
the party of the wealthy, and 
this continues to be true under 
a president like Donald Trump.
However, the wealthy 
Democrat donors’ willingness to 
elect Michael Bloomberg shows 
just how much influence the top 
one percent really has. Although 
we could note that Bloomberg 
has revamped public transit and 
turned New York City’s deficit 
into a surplus, Bloomberg 
has called taxes a “necessary 
evil,” and was completely fine 
increasing property taxes while 
cutting taxes for corporations. 
He also didn’t exactly address 
wealth inequality as mayor, and 
we must not forget about his 
disastrous stop and frisk policy, 
which overwhelmingly impacts 
Black and Latino communities.
Frankly, billionaires 
shouldn’t exist in the first 
place. These people are not 
billionaires from their income 
alone. They have a lot invested 
in equities, and they make 
absurd amounts off of capital 
gains. No one needs that much 
money. Sure, many billionaires 
give to charity, but this charity 
is not enough. Charitable giving 
as the primary source of wealth 
redistribution is another facet 
of “trickle-down” that has 
gone nowhere. It may alleviate 
some people from poverty, but 
that’s the bare minimum. Plus, 
billionaires get a lot of tax write-
offs through their charitable 
giving, incentivizing billionaires 
to not support having their 
capital gains and income taxed 
higher.
We all owe something to 
each other. That’s part of what 
living in a collective system 
is. Individuals’ attempting to 
gain public office, whose only 
qualifications are extreme 
wealth, aren’t particularly 
interesting or qualified. Let’s 
stop treating them like they are. 
Wealth may be nice to have, 
but living comfortably isn’t 
about wealth. Individualism 
can only go so far. In terms of 
our personal life choices, it’s a 
good model. But when it comes 
to running a country, everyone 
needs to contribute, particularly 
those who are much better off. 
If billionaires can argue that 
it’s socially responsible to give 
to charity, they can definitely 
pay more taxes to fund social 
programs.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: CMU’S MORAL OBLIGATION TO STAND AGAINST PALANTIR
We have tried many different 
approaches. We have done 
hours upon hours of one-on-one 
conversations with department 
heads, administrators, provosts, 
and many other “people 
in charge” of research and 
prep work, organizing and 
volunteering with immigrants’ 
rights organizations, outreach, 
protesting. None of these efforts 
have yielded any results. This is 
emotionally-charged work that 
takes away from our mental 
health and productivity as 
students here. I feel compelled 
to add productivity since that 
seems to be one of the few 
things that Carnegie Mellon 
legitimately cares about.
We had people at and outside 
the Palantir seminar protest, for 
whom this issue isn’t an abstract 
intellectual exercise. It affects 
us, directly and indirectly. Many 
of us were in tears. I know I was 
trying to hold mine off after the 
seminar as a faculty member 
insisted on a conversation about 
my taking their classes because 
“this” is what they worked 
on, and human rights were 
so important. If you think so, 
then live up to those professed 
opinions and don’t invite 
companies that support their 
violation.
So while the organizers of 
this seminar (and too many 
others) wax poetic about 
intellectually stimulating, 
respectful conversations, and 
cry wolf at a couple of students 
attempting to have precisely 
those conversations outside of 
the seminar, let us be clear about 
what’s actually happening.
Children did not get 
forcefully separated from their 
hard-working parents, whom 
they may never see again so 
that you can have intellectually 
stimulating conversations. You 
continue to invite companies 
that directly support family 
separation — informed by 
violently racist policies — 
into a campus where you have 
students with undocumented 
families, Jewish students whose 
communities were shattered by 
the largest anti-Semitic mass 
shooting in this country because 
of their opposition to such 
policies, students who come 
from countries where similar 
policies resulted or result in 
colonial wars, concentration 
camps, and torture. These are 
the folks that you repeatedly 
ask to come and speak for “the 
other side,” no matter the cost. 
Yet you demand that they be 
respectful and only engage on 
your terms, otherwise you call it 
harassment.
You are not the people being 
harassed for getting office 
visitors. The people being 
harassed are those on this 
campus who have to time and 
time again see Carnegie Mellon 
donate platforms to those who 
target their communities for 
harm.
So thank you for the invite, 
but no thank you. Do read up on 
tone policing and decolonizing 
academia? Speaking of policing, 
did you know that in Portugal, 
where I’m from, police are not 
allowed on university campuses 
without an expressed invitation 
from the university’s president? 
Did you know that this was the 
case even during the fascist 
dictatorship my parents lived 
through? And did you know that, 
on the day before your seminar, 
some of the folks at this protest 
had to face-off with dozens of 
riot police in full gear, because 
the Jewish community was 
getting arrested for peaceful civil 
disobedience against the white 
supremacist, racist policies that 
Palantir supports for profit? You 
can imagine how lovely it felt to 
have the police come tell us we 
were not allowed to disrupt your 
seminar the following day.
There’s a reason the swastika 
is largely banned in Germany. 
There’s a reason we don’t 
platform pro-dictatorship 
supporters or companies in 
Portugal, even if they also did 
do a bit of good on the side. 
If you’re even tangentially 
involved in the violation of 
basic human rights, decency, or 
dignity, you don’t get to have a 
platform, anywhere, until you 
renege those activities entirely, 
apologize, and make material 
amends. Tangentially involved 
is where you are right now.
My parents did not see their 
friends shot and killed in the gut 
next to them while protesting 
“[white] race day,” or live 
through a time when people 
were abducted to be tortured and 
killed by a white supremacist, 
racist, fascist, imperialist state, 
for me to come to the U.S. and 
see those ideologies on the rise 
here and given platform on my 
campus.
So again, let’s be clear. You 
use the word extremists, but 
you are the extremists here. 
As much as you would like to 
see yourselves as benevolent 
and impartial facilitators, you 
are the ones giving a platform 
to those whitewashing and 
profiting from violent, racist 
and white supremacist policies, 
at the direct expense of your 
students, on your campus. There 
can be no middle ground here, 
so stop pretending otherwise.
Perhaps if companies that 
engaged in “controversial 
practices,” were not invited 
anywhere, they would stop 
such practices. Also, what an 
eloquent euphemism you found 
for helping put people in cages, 
abandoning or abducting their 
children, for the crime of trying 
to put some food on the table!
If you’re feeling 
uncomfortable about this letter, 
think about how you would 
feel losing your own children 
and being put in overcrowded 
concentration camps without 
basic supplies or amenities. 
Think about how uncomfortable 
those children felt, their parents 
taken away, and spending eight 
days with no adult supervision. 
And please don’t bother 
responding with “it’s within 
CMU policy.” We know. The 
policy is mutable, and if it can 
be used as a tool for propping 
up racist violence, it needs to 
change.
I’m tired and exhausted, 
but if Palantir and similar 
companies keep getting invited, 
I’ll keep being there. In the 
meantime, do know I appreciate 
your invitation of Casa San José 
onto campus to talk about these 
issues, and of them being paid 
to do the emotional work of 
explaining morality 101 to this 
university. It is your very first 
baby-step toward reclaiming 
decency.
I also look forward to seeing 
you, along with your peers and 
mine, at Mijente’s National 
#NoTechforICE Day of Action, 
Tuesday, Nov. 19, 12 p.m to 4 
p.m. at the Wean Commons, 
Cohon University Center.

Despite Democratic  candidates 
dropping like ?ies, the ?eld is 
not dwindling any time soon. 
Last week, Deval Patrick, former 
Governor of Massachusetts, 
announced his campaign for 
President and ?led for the New 
Hampshire primary. Rumors 
have it that Michael Bloomberg, 
billionaire businessman and 
former Mayor of New York City, 
is also strongly considering a run 
for President and will announce 
in the coming days.
At its peak, the Democratic 
primary for 2020 had over 25 
major candidates. Now it is 
down to 17, with the late entry 
of Patrick. Earlier in 2018, the 
former governor declared that he 
would not seek the Presidential 
nomination, citing the cruelty 
of the process. His recent 
declaration his intent to run for 
President has led many to wonder 
why the sudden change of course.
Michael Bloomberg, who has 
yet to announce his decision, 
is funding a digital anti-Trump 
ad campaign, which some have 
cited as his ?rst step toward an 
announcement. Reportedly, 
Bloomberg plans on ?ling for the 
Alabama primary.
As long as someone is a U.S. 
born citizen over the age of 35, 
they can run for President. But 
that does not mean everyone 
should. In fact, most Democrats 
want the ?eld to shrink. A recent 
Gallup Poll found that three-
fourths of Democrats are pleased 
with the Democratic primary ?eld 
and the rates of satisfaction with 
the candidates are higher than 
that of the most recent elections.
So, if a majority of the 
Democratic electorate is pleased 
with the current candidates, why 
are more candidates jumping into 
the ?eld as others exit? Although 
most of the electorate is happy 
with the ?eld, there is still great 
anxiety concerning whether 
or not any of the candidates 
can beat Donald Trump. This 
anxiety is most prevalent in large 
Democratic donors and party 
elites.
At the start of the primary, 
these elites and donors found 
themselves donating to former 
Vice President Joe Biden, but 
debate after debate and gaffe 
after gaffe, he has shown that he is 
not the most electable candidate. 
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 
front-runner in the primary, 
and Senator Bernie Sanders, a 
consistent third in most polls, are 
considered to be too “far-left” for 
the party elites and big donors as 
they are the targets of many of 
their policy proposals.
The rise of Warren and 
Sanders is in part due to their 
bold messages and the cracks in 
Joe Biden’s candidacy, causing 
some party elites to search for 
moderate alternatives to Joe 
Biden. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is 
attempting to cast himself as the 
younger alternative to Joe Biden 
as he is currently surging in the 
Iowa polls. However, the anxiety 
surrounding Mayor Pete is that his 
campaign has shown its inability 
to reach a broad coalition, 
including voters of color.
In attempts to calm this 
anxiety, party elites have 
pressured numerous individuals 
to consider entering the race, 
including Michael Bloomberg. In 
a recent interview, Hillary Clinton 
revealed that many people in the 
party have pressured her to run. 
Secretary Clinton responded that 
she would not run.
But instead of pressuring these 
people to jump into the primary, 
party elites and donors should 
be asking these individuals to 
support the Democratic cause in 
other ways. For example, many 
political commentators, including 
Kellyanne Conway’s anti-Trump 
husband George Conway, say 
Bloomberg should buy Fox News 
to take away Trump’s main 
channel of propaganda. Michael 
Bloomberg has enough money 
that it is rumored that most of his 
campaign will be self-funded, but 
he could also use that money to 
build a media war chest for the 
eventual Democratic nominee. 
Bloomberg is the perfect example 
of someone whose in?uence 
would best be served by staying 
on the sidelines instead of 
running for President because he 
would have a greater opportunity 
to effectuate change.
Another issue causing anxiety 
is the shadow of former President 
Obama and his 2008 candidacy. 
Political pundits and party elites 
are searching for candidates 
comparable to President Obama, 
which is a mistake. Those who 
have worked with both former 
President Obama and former 
Governor Patrick say that they 
have similar leadership styles as 
they both shared top political 
advisors and have similar 
backgrounds.
But, the reality is, we should 
not be looking for another 
Obama. We should not be paying 
attention to what the party elites 
and mega-donors say because 
they have their own private 
interests. Instead, we should be 
looking for someone who matches 
the moment. We should be 
pressing forward and searching 
for something new. We do not 
need new candidates to enter 
the primary to ?nd someone that 
meets these needs because we 
already have a few candidates in 
the current ?eld that understand 
what we need as a country. More 
importantly, we have several 
candidates who know how to beat 
Donald Trump, and if put to the 
task, they probably would.
More Democrats join 2020 raceSPEAKYOUR

CMU professor’s work helps revolutionize redistricting
KIAN NASSRE
Junior Staffwriter
In 2018, Carnegie Mellon 
math professor Wesley Pegden’s 
testimony before the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court helped the 
state achieve nonpartisan 
congressional maps before the 
midterm elections. Now, his work 
is spreading to other states and 
may result in fair elections for 
North Carolina ahead of 2020.
In the 2018 Pennsylvania 
case, the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court ruled that the Republican-
drawn gerrymander violated the 
provision in the Pennsylvania 
constitution mandating “elections 
shall be fair and equal.” Under the 
old map, which had been in place 
since 2012, Democrats won ?ve 
out of 18 seats despite winning a 
majority of the statewide vote in 
some elections. In 2018, under 
the new map drawn by a court-
appointed export, Democrats won 
in nine out of eighteen districts 
and won the statewide popular 
vote.
Pegden’s work centers around 
Markov Chains, a mathematical 
system that describes the 
movement between various 
“states” according to probability. 
Pegden used Markov Chains on 
district-drawing algorithms to 
generate various random maps 
and measure how much of an 
outlier they are. By quantifying 
how much a given map — 
including current congressional 
maps — deviated from this norm, 
he was able to quantify a partisan 
gerrymander.
In an interview with The 
Tartan, Pegden stated “The 
basic idea is that you test the 
districting by making random 
changes to it, and the theorems 
that we proved allow you to make 
rigorous statistical conclusions. 
So basically, what you are doing 
is testing whether a map can be 
less partisan when you make 
small random changes to the 
boundaries. What theorems do is 
they allow you to turn this into 
rigorous scienti?c statements.”
In general, partisan gerryman-
ders are identi?able by two things: 
packing and cracking. Packing is 
the practice of placing as much 
of the opponent party in a single 
district as possible to minimize 
their impacts elsewhere. One 
example is North Carolina’s ?rst 
and fourth districts, which pack 
Democrats in Raleigh, Durham, 
and the Black Belt into just two 
districts. Cracking is when the 
opposition is split up between 
multiple districts so that they can’t 
win a majority in any of them. 
The suburbs of Austin, TX are 
“cracked” into ?ve red districts, 
some of which reach almost all 
the way to Dallas or Houston.
Besides showing how to prove 
that a map is an outlier, Pegden 
also collaborated on methods 
to remedy gerrymandering. 
In 2017, he collaborated with 
Carnegie Mellon Computer 
Science Professor Ariel Procaccia 
on a paper which suggested that 
districts be drawn in a manner 
similar to cake-cutting. The 
“I-cut-you-choose” method works 
as follows: both parties take turns 
drawing the lines. When they 
are done, the other party picks 
one district and “freezes it,” then 
redraws the remainder, back and 
forth until all the districts are 
frozen. This way, neither party is 
able to exert dominance over the 
drawing process.
An alternate method was 
previously implemented in 
California and Arizona, and will 
take effect in Michigan for the 
next redistricting cycle. Those 
states passed ballot initiatives 
that transferred the power of 
redistricting from politicians with 
stakes in the drawing of political 
lines to independent commissions. 
The Californian system prioritizes 
keeping “communities of interest” 
intact, while the Arizona system 
emphasizes swing districts.
None of these methods are 
perfect in isolation. The “I-cut-
you-choose” protocol would 
not prevent the parties from 
protecting incumbents and 
depriving voters of competitive 
elections. California and Arizona 
still have some districts that look 
deformed. The “ef?ciency gap,” 
which compares the number of 
“wasted votes” each party has in 
a state, can be blind to natural 
geographic advantages within a 
state. The same goes for the mean-
median test, which compares the 
mean vote share of a party to their 
mean vote share in the median 
district. FiveThirtyEight’s Atlas of 
Redistricting showed that when 
blindly prioritizing compactness 
with respect to county and 
municipality borders can con?ict 
with the Voting Rights Act, which 
requires a certain number of 
districts be drawn to respresent 
minority communities.
However, each of those systems 
are a substantial improvement 
over legislatures drawing the 
maps. The old Pennsylvania map 
was notorious for its contorted 
shapes. The Lehigh Valley was 
split between two districts. 
Northampton county, which 
contains Bethlehem and Easton, 
was packed with Scranton in 
the so-called “octopus” district. 
Lehigh County, which contains 
Allentown, was placed in the 
“craw?sh” district, which reached 
almost all the way to Harrisburg. 
Under the new map, both 
counties are in a single district. 
The Philadelphia suburbs, mean-
while, were cracked into the 
notorious “Goofy kicking Donald 
Duck” district and another which 
resembled a gecko. Additionally, 
the old map split the Pittsburgh 
suburbs between two red districts, 
but now all of Allegheny country 
outside of Pittsburgh is in just one 
suburban swing district.
After the new map was 
put into effect, Governor Tom 
Wolf appointed Pegden to a 
commission with the goal of 
reforming redistricting. The 
commission recommended that 
maps be drawn by an 11-member 
bipartisan commission, whose 
members would be appointed by 
various legislative leaders and the 
governor. The recommendation 
encourages that redistricting 
be done with public input and 
prescribes to a combination of 
the typical redistricting criteria. 
The criteria include preventing 
splitting counties or cities unless 
necessary and stating that 
districts must be contiguous.
“We conducted public hearings 
where we collected feedback from 
people on ways to improve the 
redistricting process.… What’s 
important is to not just add 
constraints to what the drawers 
can do, but actually, make it so 
that the people drawing are not 
some self-interested legislators. 
If you are trying to make the 
map less partisan, it’s a problem 
to let the legislators draw the 
maps themselves because it’s 
not clear that constraining them 
with things like compactness is 
meaningful,” Pegden said. “As 
to whether the report, which 
legislative Republicans declined 
to participate in, will be ignored 
by the legislature, There is some 
indication that people are taking 
it seriously, but it’s too early to 
say.”
Recently, Pegden’s testimony 
in a redistricting case in North 
Carolina contributed to a ruling 
that the lines for the state 
legislature districts violated a 
provision in the North Carolina 
constitution. As a result, a new 
map was drawn by the Republican 
legislature which still favors their 
party, albeit by a smaller margin.
“The lesson is that these cases 
can still be successful in state-
level courts and that bringing 
rigorous data which allow you 
to analyze redistricting is key,” 
Pegden said.
The ripple effects of Pegden’s 
work in this case were felt just a 
few weeks ago when the North 
Carolina courts ruled against 
the congressional map. As of 
publishing, the legislature is 
on the verge of passing a new 
map that enshrines an eight-
to-five Republican advantage 
instead of the current 10-to-three 
split. Daily Kos elections writer 
Stephen Wolf, who specializes 
in gerrymandering and regularly 
draws his own congressional dis-
tricts for a fair comparison, has 
shown that the new map is still 
biased towards Republicans. His 
map is similar to the one about to 
be passed, except that it keeps the 
Sandhills region of North Caroli-
na in a single district which voted 
for Hillary Clinton by about two 
percent, thus allowing Democrats 
to win six out of 13 districts.
All of these rulings are based 
in state constitutions, so they are 
independent of recent Supreme 
Court rulings that prevented 
federal courts from interfering in 
gerrymandering.
Regardless of the outcome of 
these redistricting battles, the 
fight for fair maps will restart 
in 2021 in the aftermath of the 
2020 census and the decennial 
reapportionment of congressional 
districts. Pennsylvania will likely 
lose its 18th district and North 
Carolina will likely gain its 14th. 
The fairness of both states maps 
will hinge on the outcome of 
the 2020 legislative elections, in 
which none or all of the states’ 
legislative chambers could flip to 
Democrats.
Old, new, and nonpartisan (top to bottom) district maps for North Carolina. The nonpartisan variant was drawn by Daily Kos writer 
Stephen Wolf, similar to the new map recently passed by the state legislature, but with another district won by Clinton in 2016.

Gerrymandering has a tangible effect on election outcomes. The old North Carolina map cost Democrats several districts in 2018.
Regardless of the outcome of 
redistricting battles, the ?ght for 
fair maps will restart in 2021 in the 
aftermath of the 2020 census.

Section VIII complaint against USA Badminton filed by USOPC
CMU Football victorious in Academic Bowl vs Case
NATHANIEL RICHMOND
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon University 
football team relied on their 
defense at home to shock Case 
Western Reserve University and 
the rest of the PAC with a win. The 
?nal score of the game was 24-21, 
giving Carnegie Mellon the 34th 
annual Academic Bowl.
Carnegie Mellon forced some 
timely turnovers and managed just 
enough offense to hold the score 
at 24-21 in the ?nal seconds of the 
game. Case Western mounted one 
?nal drive with 47 seconds left in 
the fourth quarter and made it to 
the Tartans’ 33, but their ?nal ?eld 
goal attempt came up short and hit 
the crossbar to give the Carnegie 
Mellon the win.
The entire game was a back-
and-forth thriller between 
Carnegie Mellon and Case Western 
Reserve. The Tartans jumped to a 
10-0 lead in the ?rst quarter with 
help from a punt kicked deep out 
of Case Western territory that led 
to a quick touchdown. However, 
Case Western responded with 14 
unanswered points in the second 
quarter. Carnegie Mellon fought 
back and capitalized on a couple of 
turnovers in the third quarter for 
its own 14-0 run, and they never 
trailed again.
The Tartans’ defense carried 
a strong day for the team with 
4 turnovers forced, including 3 
interceptions. These interceptions 
were crucial for Carnegie Mellon, 
as one interception was returned 
for a touchdown and another 
set up a passing touchdown in 
the third quarter. The Tartans 
only gained 147 yards of total 
offense compared to Case Western 
Reserve’s 399, but they came 
ahead where it counted with a ?eld 
goal and three touchdowns.
The game was a satisfying 
conclusion for Carnegie Mellon 
football after a resurgent season. 
After going 6-4 in 2018, the Tartans 
improved to 8-2 to ?nish 2019. The 
football seniors were also able to 
go out with a win for Senior Day. Of 
course, the seniors in Kiltie Band 
also got to celebrate the win after a 
halftime performance that brie?y 
included Case Western’s band. To 
the delight of the Carnegie Mellon 
crowd, the Case Western fans who 
occupied one half of the stadium 
left disappointed after Carnegie 
Mellon ended Case Western’s 
undefeated season.
While the Tartan’s football 
season is over, the Academic Bowl 
will remain in good hands for at 
least another year.
By a score of 24-21, the Tartans defeated Case Western in the 34th Academic Bowl marring Case Western’s perfect record with a single loss.

This is Penalty Shouts, The 
Tartan’s sports column inspired 
by the The New Yorker’s column 
Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled 
column will focus on anything 
and everything funny in the sports 
world that is deserving of our 
comedic attention.
A really smart person a really 
long time ago once said, “the force 
of an object is equal to its mass 
multiplied by its acceleration,” 
and that’s how we got Einstein’s 
Theory of General Relativity. 
Using this mathematically 
certain and certi?ed True Science 
equation, we can extrapolate the 
answer to an almost unsolvable 
problem. The mass of a Browns 
defensive lineman, multiplied 
by the standard rotational 
acceleration of a helmet at the 
end of an arm, equals the force 
of a black hole, or at least, the 
same amount of force required 
for Roger Goodell to take punitive 
action.
To continue making fun of 
Roger Goodell would be didactic. 
We all know that guy is bad, so I’m 
going to talk about something else 
entirely: the sports commentator 
discourse that has so unfairly 
maligned the name of Myles 
Garrett. So far everyone has 
spread the false news that Garrett, 
the Browns’ lineman, performed a 
truly dangerous action out there 
last Sunday. I mean, sure, taking a 
potshot at a backup quarterback’s 
noggin with a helmet is not 
generally considered “proper 
football etiquette” or “safe.”
Let’s step back for a moment, 
though. Garrett’s daring attempt 
at a big-time, honest-to-God 
murder charge is a feat of 
athleticism more conceptually 
interesting than any attempted 
murder hithertofore seen in 
the history of the world. Step 
aside Tiger Woods driving an 
SUV under the in?uence, watch 
out OJ Simpson, forget about it 
Daryl Strawberry. There’s a new 
champion in town, and his name 
is Myles Garrett. To be able to rip 
off a man’s helmet, hold on to it 
for a few moments while a bunch 
of burly guys push you around, 
and then use it to strike the same 
dude on the head requires... well, 
it requires something.
Garrett, after this feat of 
athleticism, is now suspended 
inde?nitely. Likely, that means he 
will not be playing for the rest of 
the season, and for those games, 
he will go without pay. While 
what he did has been decried 
as unsafe, I’d like to ask you all: 
was it really? Is it so bad that he 
hit Mason Rudolph with his own 
helmet? From over here, it seems 
pretty funny, so ask yourself a 
question: when was the last time 
you got to see someone hit by 
their own helmet? It’s roughly the 
equivalent of your older brother 
going “Stop hitting yourself. 
Stop hitting yourself.” Sure, what 
Garrett did could be construed as 
aggravated assault, manslaughter, 
or attempted murder, but things 
like that happen every game.

Last Tuesday, the U.S. Olympic 
& Paralympic Committee ?led a 
Section 8 complaint against U.S.A. 
Badminton, intending to revoke 
U.S.A. Badminton’s status as the 
National Governing Body for 
badminton and para-badminton 
in the United States.
The complaint follows a 
2019 follow-up report of a 2018 
compliance audit that saw a host 
of unresolved issues relating to 
athlete safety, governance, and 
?nances, identifying four “high 
risk” areas in the athlete safety and 
SafeSport compliance alone. In 
an address to the public, the U.S. 
Olympic & Paralympic Committee 
wrote that they “[have] concluded 
that U.S.A. Badminton has failed 
to meet its responsibilities as an 
NGB [National Governing Body] 
and consistently failed to meet 
its obligations to its members 
and to U.S. athletes. Further, 
U.S.A. Badminton has failed to 
conduct itself in a manner that 
demonstrates [it can ful?ll those 
responsibilities].”
The stakes are high for U.S.A. 
Badminton. Should it lose 
its recognition as a National 
Governing Body, it will also 
lose its ties to the U.S. Olympic 
& Paralympic Committee. 
With eight months before the 
summer Olympics in Tokyo, 
this is a critical time in which 
the top badminton players in 
the country are intensifying 
their training regimen. If U.S.A. 
Badminton cannot resolve the 
situation by making the necessary 
changes regarding athlete safety, 
governance and ?nances, and 
adhere to SafeSport guidelines, 
it will lose its recognition with 
the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic 
Committee, which will move in 
to take over U.S.A. Badminton 
programs on an interim basis.
The revocation of U.S.A. 
Badminton’s status as a National 
Governing Body would take 
several months, however. This 
means that should the U.S. 
Olympic & Paralympic Committee 
choose to pursue and follow 
through with the revocation, they 
would have scarcely any time to 
assume adequate control over 
programs and athletes ahead of 
the games.
Recognizing this, Sarah 
Hirshland, the CEO of the U.S. 
Olympic & Paralympic Committee 
and the ?ler of the complaint 
made the following statement: 
“We have set high standards 
in order to associate with the 
Olympic & Paralympic movements 
in the United States, and we must 
hold organizations accountable 
when they don’t live up to those 
standards. Seeking to revoke 
recognition is not a decision 
that the USOPC came to easily, 
but we believe it is the right and 
necessary action in the interest of 
the athletes we all serve.”
In the wake of the Larry 
Nassar sexual abuse scandal and 
Congressional pressure towards 
more stringent regulations of 
National Governing Bodies, this 
decision by the U.S. Olympic & 
Paralympic Committee seems to 
be a move in the right direction. 
The existence of “high risk” areas 
relating to athlete safety and 
SafeSport — the latter being an 
organization seeking to address 
and prevent child abuse in sports 
— is, in and of itself, a matter 
of grave concern. Swift action 
on the part of the U.S. Olympic 
& Paralympic Committee may 
not only mitigate the potential 
future offenses but also provides 
a precedent for the rest of the 
National Governing Bodies. 
In light of these events, issues 
regarding the adherence to 
the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic 
Committee will likely be quickly 
and appropriately addressed.
The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic 
Committee wrote in an open 
letter, that the ?ling of the Section 
8 complaint is “the ?rst step in an 
important process. Recognizing 
that what follows this process 
isn’t clear, we have concluded that 
the uncertainty this will no doubt 
bring is better than allowing 
the status quo to continue. The 
athletes deserve better and we 
simply must hold organizations 
accountable if they can’t meet our 
standards.”
This crackdown on U.S.A. 
Badminton’s failure to prioritize 
the welfare of its athletes is most 
certainly a sign of progress by 
the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic 
Committee, and it seems 
fathomable that it will continue 
in its reformed approach to non-
compliant National Governing 
Bodies, having seemingly made 
the critical and necessary choice 
to prioritize its athletes.

The Californian singer mxmtoon, also known by her first name Maia, brought her lo-fi beats and 
ukeleles (yes, plural) to the Underground at Carnegie Mellon on Wednesday, November 13. On 
a cold Wednesday night, the Underground’s seating area was filled with people eager to listen 
to songs from her debut album the masquerade and meet the sensational 19-year-old who gained 
millions of streams on her songs on Spotify and 3.7 million monthly listeners.
She opened with her song “blame game,” a grim love anthem backed by beautiful drums from 
Jacob Guzman and guitar from Keri Prath. She interacted with her audience in between every 
song, talking about the weather and how she is good at “writing sad songs about [her] insecuri-
ties” and that it leaves her unbelievably shocked when people listen to her music. She continued 
performing the song “unspoken words,” “suffice,” and “seasonal depression.” The song “seasonal 
depression,” she says, is to “throw a spotlight” on this rare form of depression, but I found it a tad 
hypocritical that she was monetizing this serious issue on T-shirts that said “seasonal depression” 
at her merch stand that night.
The audience was enamored as she continued playing “cliché,” “feelings are fatal,” and 
“porcelain.” She talked about how her parents joked that her coming to Carnegie Mellon will 
be the “closest she’ll ever get to college.” She played many other songs as the night went 
along, from “i feel like chet” to “my TED talk” and her infamous TikTok sensation, “prom dress.” 
Everyone in the audience was singing along to this last song and deafening applause rang 
throughout the room as she finished.
I knew of mxmtoon because I stumbled upon her songs on Spotify, which in my opinion, has been 
a huge factor in her success. Her effortless ukelele paired with soft tunes about love sells to every 
audience, and her short songs are the perfect recipe for repeat streams. She sounded better live 
than she does in her heavily produced studio album, showing her roots as a stripped-down vocalist 
on YouTube. Her vocal performance differentiates her from other contemporaries with a ukelele 
and GarageBand, and her journey as an immigrant bisexual woman of color forms a very unique 
identity, which is showcased in her music. She seems to be amassing followers even after her 
social media boom, whcih may help her music go mainstream.

Emmett Donlon’s Animal Cult / Lesser Men 
explores themes of boredom and violence and 
where these themes intersect in everyday life, 
through pieces like “Jen with Bloody Nose” 
and “Gorbachev Kissing Honecker / Now 
Honecker Kissing Gorbachev / the Last Open 
Girls I Saw Before When I Had to Cough.” In 
“Jen with Bloody Nose,” a girl is centered in 
the painting with a mostly beige backdrop. 
She is wearing a white shirt and the observer 
can clearly see the blood dripping from her 
nose and onto her white shirt. Her facial 
expression, though, says it all: she is tired, 
but more so, bored. A bloody nose is violent, 
but it is also boring. Donlon’s four pieces 
on Erich Honecker were desensitizing, but

as you realized what you were looking at, 
a man who had done so much to violently 
suppress homosexuality in his country, you 
did experience a “retraumatization” of sorts. 
Although it was the same portrait painted four 
times and could inspire a sense of boredom, 
there was also the feeling that you were 
witnessing an extremely violent person and 
that these two things, violence and boredom, 
often exist together.
In the back room, “Animal Cult,” an 
installation comprised of plants, wood, fabric, 
hand woven baskets, and handmade nets, 
thrived with six small ermines ruling over the 
coyote and fox. Emmett remarked that he 
“didn’t know what they were doing” because there 
may be no way of knowing. In any case, the energy 
of the ermines was sinister and wise. The scene, 
while haunting, was also attention-grabbing. It was 
hard to leave the room and turn my back on the 
ritualistic endeavor taking place, as if once I turned 
around they would continue the ceremony. The 
themes of boredom and violence could also be seen 
in “Animal Cult.” Taxidermy can be boring, but it is 
also a dead animal and therefore also extremely 
violent. However, dead animals are seen every 
day and so we are desensitized. Yet, the repetition 
brings us back. When you stare at the scene for 
long enough you realized that you are looking at 
dead animals in a ritual. Something that could have 
been boring at first glance had now transformed 
into something gruesome and violent.
Interview with the Artist
How would you describe your journey as 
an artist?
I’ve always really liked art. When I was young, I 
said that I wanted to be an artist. That changed a 
lot and when I was in high school, I thought I was 
going to be a musician, but I still really liked art, so 
I applied only to art schools and now I’m here. It’s 
been a crazy three years, but it’s been really good.
What influences you the most as an artist?
I am influenced by a lot. History. Here, I have 
some paintings of Erich Honecker, the head of East 
Germany, and over here I have a painting of him 
kissing Gorbachev, which was the Soviet fraternal 
greeting. I always found it really interesting, 
especially because these two governments 
suppressed homosexuality in their countries. So, 
trying to reclaim that history and insert myself into it 
as well, I’m really interested in that.
I’m also really inspired by what I find online, like 
that’s porn and that’s a porn magazine and there’s 
dead birds with them, I actually didn’t realize that 
there were dead birds in both those pieces. That’s 
crazy. There’s this pleasure in these bodies but 
Animal Cult / Lesser Men 
4

---------------------------------------------------

then you’re really turned off because of the 
dead birds in the paintings, but then it’s also a 
painting and a painting is also used as a form 
of pleasure as well.
I’m also inspired by Andy Warhol and the idea 
of repetition. I like to paint the same image 
multiple times. I have more paintings of Erich 
Honecker. There’s this thing about repetition 
that desensitizes you to the image, but once 
you remember what you’re looking at you 
experience this trauma of seeing an image for 
the first time.
Do you do that on purpose? Do you 
know when you’re going to paint 
something multiple times?
I like to think of all of my paintings as almost 
the same image. There are some paintings 
that are outliers, but with these two paintings 
over here, that’s a dead cat and this is me 
when I was younger, standing next to a really 
tall vase. I think of these as the same image. 
There is no difference between that cat and me 
because they’re both just paint on canvas. I do 
think about whether or not I’m going to paint 
something again.
What does it mean to you that this is 
your first solo show?
It’s a lot of pressure [laughs]. It’s more to prove 
to myself that I can put together a body of work 
that works together and that can fill up such a 
large space. Proving to myself and to everyone 
else that I can be an artist. All eyes are on me.
Do you think that the serious in the 
not serious is a theme that you like to 
play with?
I try to find the absurdities in the 
uncomfortable to make the uncomfortable 
more easy to accept. A lot of this work is 
about boredom and violence and about 
how they are the same thing. Violence is 
so apparent in everyday life. For example, 
this piece is of me getting a haircut in a 
bathtub, but it’s a very violent image but 
it’s also a very boring thing because I’m just 
getting a haircut. We’re so desensitized to violence 
that it’s boring to us now. But even being bored is 
extremely uncomfortable. Like solitary confinement 
is forcing somebody into boredom which is a really 
violent thing.
When did you first start to explore those 
sorts of themes?
I noticed that that was what I was doing around 
spring of last year. Looking back through all of my 
work it became apparent that even though all of it 
was functioning totally in that vein a lot of it was 
pointing towards the fact that I was going to start 
making work about that.
If you could have one superpower, what 
would it be and why?
I wish I could teleport, because right now it’s way 
too cold to go outside. Also if I could teleport with 
my paintings that would be great, because walking 
them down the street from the CFA isn’t going 
to be fun. Also I wouldn’t have to walk. So that 
would be great.

The two-time Grammy Award-winning 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) 
gave a moving tribute to The Beatles, 
performing some of their greatest hits from 
“Here Comes the Sun” to “I’ve Just Seen a 
Face” and even “Let it Be.”
The evening was also graced by guest 
artists: vocalists Paul Loren and Colin 
Smith, guitarist Greg Mayo, drummer Zach 
Jones, keyboardist Andy Robinson, and 
electric bassist Brian Killeen, who each 
added their own flair to the music of the 
Beatles. The onstage charisma of Loren 
and Smith easily won over the audience, 
even getting them to sing along in “Hey 
Jude.” Meanwhile, Mayo’s guitar solos 
drew heavy amounts of well-deserved 
applause.
The Beatles, often regarded as the most 
influential band of all time, have certainly 
left a permanent mark in musical history. 
Their experimentation with musical 
styles and instruments is regarded as a 
revolution (no pun intended) in music 
production, and the PSO certainly didn’t 
shy away from experimentation. The 
addition of strings and brass added an 
unexpected, rich flavor to the pop and rock 
of The Beatles. To quote PSO conductor 
Todd Ellison, “It was almost like the songs 
were written just yesterday.”
On that note, the orchestral version of 
“Yesterday” was honestly one of the best 
versions I had ever heard. The way that the 
strings crescendoed and decrescendoed 
along with the vocals enhanced the 
meaning of the lyrics. In a sense, it made 
the song more emotionally expressive. 
The same could also be said for another 
favorite, “Eleanor Rigby,” whose staccato-
filled opening is usually hauntingly 
beautiful, and the incorporation of the 
brass almost gave it a slightly jazzy and 
smooth feel that subverted that trope. 
Simply put, I loved it despite its lack of 
vocals. For once, I actually enjoyed the 
subsequent “Here Comes the Sun,” a song 
my inner cynic usually turns her nose at. 
In terms of staging, I personally thought 
the lighting was perfect for the evening. 
There was a tasteful balance of bright 
colors, including cyan, magenta, red, and 
yellow that would occasionally spot during 
the chorus and even during vocal high 
points. The continuous slideshow presented 
behind the orchestra with images and 
photographs seemed a little cheesy during 
most parts. However, there were some 
great shots that truly showcased a glimpse 
of the world during the sixties and the 
history of The Beatles themselves. 
All in all, I began the evening under the 
chandeliers with a notebook and tired 
eyes, and I ended the evening with starry 
eyes and a grin from ear-to-ear. I don’t 
think I could’ve found a better way to have 
spent my Friday night and I’d do it again, 
time after time.

SCHOOL
GIRLS

---------------------------------------------------

Before there was Regina George, there was Paulina, a queen 
bee and undisputed ruler of Aburi Girl’s Boarding School. 
Set in 1986, School Girls; or, The African Mean Girls Play, 
tells the story of a group of high school girls in Central 
Ghana. The play is a wonderful mix of laughter-inducing 
lines, teenage girl drama, and African girls struggling to 
find beauty and identity in their skin color. The plot centers 
around the girls getting ready for the Ms. Ghana pageant; 
the winner of which will compete to become Ms. Universe.
The show begins with Paulina surrounded by her loyal posse: 
Gifty, Ama, and Mercy. Seated by herself is Nana, the odd 
one out, eating a bowl of porridge. Paulina immediately 
rips into her for being chubby and constantly eating, asking 
sarcastically if Nana wants to be “fat fat or popular.” 
Paulina’s sidekicks chime in and laugh, but as soon as Paulina 
exits, the other girls rush to Nana’s side to comfort her.
Right away, you can definitely see the parallels between 
this story and Mean Girls. Paulina asserts her dominance as 
the ringleader, surrounding herself with loyal Gretchens and 
Karens and putting down innocent, vulnerable Nana. She 
continues to torment Nana throughout the story by calling 
her a “cow” and threatening to rat her out for always having 
a supply of food. Paulina also makes it clear that she is the 
obvious choice to win the Ms. Ghana pageant, and none 
of the girls should stand in her way. Paulina will not be 
intimidated.
That is, until a new student enters. Meet Ericka, the Cady 
Heron of this story. Ericka is also Ghanian. However, she 
has lived most of her life in the United States, and the girls 
at Aburi are absolutely fascinated by her. They want to 
hear everything about her life in the U.S.: what the people 
are like, how she got her hair to be so long, what kind of 
makeup she uses. When Ericka tells the Aburi girls she has 
a poster signed by Bobby Brown, they lose their minds in 
total teenage-girl fashion. Paulina also fumes when she learns 
the pageant recruiter has her sights set on Ericka over her. 
Motivated by money and power, the recruiter thinks Ericka 
and her lighter skin will have a better chance on the world 
stage than Paulina and her deep complexion.
Tensions rise and fall as the girls prepare for the pageant. 
When it comes time to compete in front of the recruiter, all 
9
hell breaks loose. This is when the Burn Book pages are 
discovered and everyone breaks into jungle madness, as 
Cady would say. Secrets are revealed, gut-wrenchingly foul 
language is used, and punches are thrown.
I cannot divulge any further details without spoiling the plot. 
No, I am not going to tell you who threw the punches or who 
won the pageant. But what I can tell you is that this is an 
important, worthwhile play to see. The light-hearted, comedic 
moments are thoughtfully blended with the somber, serious 
ones. I laughed out loud when the girls repeatedly said 
“Calvin Kleen” instead of “Calvin Klein” and sang horribly 
out of tune for the pageant. But when I saw some girls 
question their beauty because of their skin tone, when I saw 
Nana being bullied for being chubby, when I heard them call 
each other the most horrible names, my heart ached.
Stepping aside from the actual content of the play, I thought 
the Pittsburgh Public Theater (PPT) brought School Girls to life 
in a deliberate way that yielded outstanding results. First off, 
they selected great artistic talent to tell the story. The play is 
directed by Shariffa Ali, a Kenyan-born director who boasts 
an impressive resume between being faculty at Princeton 
University and directing an upcoming world premiere at the 
Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Each of the actors in the eight-
character ensemble are female and African-American, one 
of whom is Ghanaian-American, all of whom played their 
characters wonerfully.
Not only was the acting and directing on point, but the set 
design was incredibly realistic as well. Every detail from 
books on the shelves to cafeteria tables convinced me it was 
plucked from a high school. The costumes accurately reflected 
the time period and were beautifully crafted. I liked the 
traditional African clothing worn by the headmistress and the 
coordination of the girls’ school uniforms. I was especially 
impressed by the detail of Paulina’s pink pageant gown — I’m 
sure those poofy, ‘80s-style sleeves were not easy to make.
Overall, the execution of the play by PPT was top-notch. I 
applaud them for their commitment to accurate representation 
in their storytelling in all aspects, from the cast to the set 
to the costumes. No worries if you have not seen School 
Girls yet; it runs through Dec. 7 at PPT’s home, the O’Reilly 
Theater, on Penn Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh.

Last Saturday, seven dance teams from across the 
country came to Pittsburgh in the celebration of 
bhangra dance, music, and culture in an annual 
contest named Bhangra in the Burgh. The sold-out 
audience gathered to support their favorite teams and 
offer moral support, as well as celebrate South Asian 
culture in the largest student-run event in Pittsburgh.
As the staff hustled to put the finishing touches before 
doors opened, I had the pleasure of speaking with 
co-director Madhuri Raman about her experience 
being involved in Bhangra in the Burgh. “I started 
freshman year, I was always a member of the 
op-staff. I loved the music, I loved the dancing, I 
really got to meet people and learn about how it all 
works.”
This year Bhangra in the Burgh decided to donate 
a large part of their proceeds towards the Greater 
Community Pittsburgh Food Bank, a nonprofit 
organization that helps people in need and works to 
eliminate hunger in the Pittsburgh community. “Every 
dollar earned translates to five meals, it’s really 
exciting”, Raman said.
10
The night began with the emcees getting the crowd 
excited with a few jokes (“What did the buffalo say 
when his son left for college? Bye-son.”) and they 
certainly had no trouble keeping the audience excited 
for the rest of the night.
Also, I’m starting to think that bhangra music is 
just energizing in nature, but maybe that’s just me. 
The Cornell team near my seat couldn’t keep their 
shoulders down when a bhangra mashup of “Taki 
Taki” by DJ Snake began to play.
Throughout the show, there were several wonderful 
and outstanding performances including special 
appearances from CMU Deewane, Carnegie Mellon’s 
all-male South-Asian acapella team; Pitt Mastane, 
the Bollywood-fusion dance team of the University 
of Pittsburgh; and the local Nandaik Dance Studio, 
a studio that teaches and celebrates dances from all 
over India.
All in all, it was a great evening and a show not to 
miss. Bhangra in the Burgh should definitely be on 
every Pittsburgh college student’s bucket list.

When she was young, Madeline Miller’s 
mother would read her passages from The 
Odyssey, and she quickly fell in love with 
Greek mythology and the classical works 
of Homer. Madeline Miller’s books, The 
Song of Achilles and Circe, are retellings 
of ancient mythology as well as acclaimed 
New York Times bestselling novels. 
Miller was one of the visiting authors for 
the Pittsburgh Arts & Lectures series, which 
has been bringing acclaimed authors 
to Pittsburgh to discuss their literary 
background and novels. Miller’s visit was 
a rare opportunity to learn more about 
the celebrated author who transformed 
the modern perception of classical texts, 
broadening the literary horizon for many 
who have never read Homer. 
During her talk, Miller discussed her 
motivation for writing The Song of Achilles 
and Circe. Both novels tell the story of an 
underdog and breathe life into otherwise 
one-dimensional side characters that are 
often forgotten. Regarding the writing of 
Circe, Miller felt that the original story, 
The Odyssey, constricted a powerful 
female character and portrayed her as 
being bested by the male hero, with the 
unrecognized truth lying under the surface. 
Miller asked the audience to consider 
how often the word “witch” is still used 
to describe women who wield power that 
society cannot control. As a result, Miller 
said that Circe is often demonized in the 
media as a woman who is scorned by love 
and is vengeful towards men. Thus, it was 
particularly important that Miller took on a 
feminist lens when writing Circe’s character 
because she is a powerful female icon that 
forged her own path in the world, rather 
than being defined by society and other 
men.
Circe is most famous for turning men into 
pigs, and Miller wanted the reader to 
understand the reasons for her actions. 
She stated that “it is a pretty extreme thing 
to do, and it is treated in later literature 
as, ‘Well, you know women, that is what 
they will do to you.’” By giving Circe a life 
beyond The Odyssey, giving context to 
her life before and after Odysseus, Circe 
becomes a multi-dimensional character 
who has her “whole host of associations.” 
Told from the perspective of Odysseus, 
The Odyssey took on a very male-centric 
perspective where powerful females like 
Circe and Calypso were always subjugated 
under male power. Miller hoped to subvert 
this impression and revitalize Circe, as she 
wanted to “put Circe at the center of the 
epic, giving her the mistakes, the passions, 
the victories that the male heroes had by 
right.” Thus, including the other aspects 
of her life that did not include Odysseus 
was a crucial aspect of Miller’s story. Circe 
is not only a powerful witch, but also 
the daughter of Helios, the aunt of the 
Minotaur and Medea, and much more. 
Each of these stories that Miller found was 
weaved into a beautiful story of Circe’s life 
journey of “trying to find her way in the 
world and find her people in the world.” 
When asked about her writing process, 
Miller stated that, as a classist herself, 
she used Homer’s original text, as well 
as other translations and Greek texts for 
reference. In particular, Emily Wilson’s 
translation of The Odyssey played a crucial 
role in her own development of Circe. 
Traditional translations of The Odyssey are 
often still male-centric, but Wilson stayed 
true to Homer’s text while also offering a 
fair place for the women in the story. Miller 
mentioned that while she does do some 
preliminary research, she often goes back 
to her sources to find the “shiny pieces” 
that stick out to her and incorporate that 
in her story. She did extensive research 
on material culture, such as the daggers, 
loom, and clothes referenced in the book. 
Every single herb that Circe uses has been 
referenced at some point in traditional 
Greek texts. 
Miller’s insightful talk answered many 
questions that her readers, including 
me, had about the story and her own 
motivation for writing the story. Listening to 
an author explain her own work is always 
an invaluable opportunity. The Pittsburgh 
Arts & Lectures series is still ongoing, so 
don’t miss out on great opportunities to 
listen to more visiting authors.

A dazzling spectacle to witness, Or, a 
colorful play directed by Kim Weild, is 
hilarious, heartwarming, and inspiring 
all at once. The cast members Dylan 
T. Jackson, Katie Sacks, and Georgia 
Mendes did a truly fabulous job of 
immersing themselves into their 
characters. In particular, Jackson and 
Sacks took on the challenge of playing 
multiple characters throughout the 
play, their flawless costume changes 
and transitions into character almost 
one after the other responding with a 
resounding “challenge accepted.” Their 
penetrating performance absorbed the 
audience into the time period as they 
followed Mendes’s character, Aphra, 
an aspiring 17th-century playwright 
and ex-spy for the King. Just released 
from debtor’s prison, she seeks to gain 
recognition in the theater as a woman. 
The play was carried by the passion 
of these three actors, their hearts on 
their sleeves and the enthusiasm in 
their voices enchanting. I, for one, 
left the theater practically baptized in 
the unapologetic energy that these 
strong characters bestowed upon 
the room, and had to remind myself 
that I am, indeed, not a Reformation 
playwright on the verge of a theatrical 
breakthrough (although that doesn’t 
sound too bad to me).
Wonderfully executed, Jackson, Sacks, 
and Mendes displayed true and raw

talent. Having the opportunity to watch 
them display such brilliance was a 
thrill that brought a script of written 
words to life and the audience along 
for the ride.
As Carnegie Mellon students in 
the graduating class of 2020, the 
School of Drama allows them the 
opportunity to present their work 
in New York and Los Angeles at 
showcase presentations in these areas. 
As described on the Carnegie Mellon 
School of Drama webpage, these 
showcase presentations are designed 
to give graduating students across all 
disciplines the chance to meet “leading 
arts and entertainment professionals,” 
launching “new graduates into 
professional work within their fields.” 
However, to get there, they need 
funding.
Much like Or, embraces the 
emergence of women into the 
theatrical world, so should we embrace 
the emergence of these skilled actors 
into an experience that holds immense 
opportunities. Take a quick look at 
their GoFundMe page to donate, 
support, and help this remarkable 
graduating class of exceptional actors 
showcase their God-given talents in 
New York and Los Angeles. Or, you 
might regret it.

Mark Fischbach, known online as Markiplier, 
began his “A Heist with Markiplier” special 
on Nov. 6. Hardcore subscribers could 
purchase a $4.99 monthly subscription and 
help navigate the course of the livestream 
by “voting on which way they wanted to go 
with emotes,” or emoticons in the live chat: 
“one red paddle, and one green paddle.” 
What should have been an interactive 
experience for users and the YouTuber went 
haywire when the site banned hundreds 
of accounts that “spammed” the emotes. 
An hour and a half into the livestream, 
Fischbach and his moderators caught onto 
this trend, but the damage had been done 
by the time the viewers were warned.
On Nov. 8, Fischbach addressed the 
problem in his video “YouTube has a huge 
problem...” and expressed his frustration 
with the platform.
The termination of accounts would be 
infuriating enough on its own. However, 
many people whose accounts were restricted 
or even terminated had their appeals 
denied. 
People’s subscriptions that they paid money 
for disappeared. People’s content vanished. 
Their engagement with the platform, gone.
The problem runs even deeper than people’s 
YouTube accounts being terminated. Not 
only were people’s YouTube accounts being 
terminated; their entire Google accounts 
were as well.
Markiplier said in a video, “What are they 
going to explain to their boss: ‘Oh, sorry, I 
can’t get into my Google account; I was at a 
Markiplier livestream’?”
The following Monday, Fischbach uploaded 
“YouTube’s Big Problem --- UPDATE” and 
gave his viewers an update on the situation. 
He thanked the YouTube team for being 
cooperative and even praised Susanne 
Daniels, the Head of Content at YouTube, 
for showing genuine concern.
“There are a lot of people at YouTube who 
genuinely care about the platform,” said 
Fischbach, Daniels being one of them. This 
leads to the question: what is going on with 
YouTube if they’re not run by money-hungry 
corporate drones?
In this case, the incident was triggered by 
an anti-spam measure running amok. A 
software engineer for YouTube took to Reddit 
to give a brief rundown of the situation. 
In this post, the user highlights one of 
YouTube’s significant shortcomings: it is out 
of touch with its user base.
“The appeals should not have been denied,” 
said the post. “The problem is that... for 
someone not familiar with the social context, 
it absolutely does look like (real) spam.” 
This, in combination with the extensive size 
of the platform, triggered the incident.
YouTube is no stranger to accusations of not 
understanding its consumers. In 2017, many 
creators found themselves becoming victims 
of the “Adpocalypse” where controversial 
content and entire channels were becoming 
demonetized. In a statement, the platform 
cited using “machine learning to determine 
if a video meets our advertiser-friendly 
guidelines” and publicly offered to send 
appeals to human reviewers should the 
creators feel that their content is mistakenly 
flagged.
However, YouTube failed to give every 
appeal the attention that the creators 
deserved, only having appeals manually 
approved should the videos have at least 
1,000 views and come from channels with 
at least 10,000 subscribers. Even if the 
appeal passed successfully and the video 
is re-monetized, the video might have 
passed peak viewership and thus missed the 
opportunity to garner revenue at the right 
time.
Demonetization continues to be a pressing 
issue for creators, especially those who rely 
on the platform for their livelihoods. The 
peak of Adpocalypse may be in the past, 
but YouTube’s algorithms for choosing what 
content to demonetize are still flawed. The 
platform has expanded to a scale that the 
company has failed to keep up with, and 
the lack of understanding of its users further 
digs its grave.
YouTube was probably not created with 
the intention of becoming the pinnacle of 
content creating that it is today. With its 
expansive growth and large user base, it’s 
understandable that there will be hiccups. 
However, YouTube needs to prioritize getting 
in touch with its user base, especially if it 
wants to stay relevant.

on Broadway !
When 
I saw 
Waitress 
on Broadway, 
I was pleasantly 
surprised by how 
warm and fun 
the show was in 
comparison to the 
weather outside. 
The theatre itself was filled 
with the sight and smell of pies, 
along with a feeling of community 
— truly a lovely experience.
However, after over three-and-a-half years 
on Broadway, Waitress’s run is drawing to a 
close. With the closing date set to be Jan. 5, 
2020, there are less than 50 days left before 
its last performance.
Carnegie Mellon University alum Drew 
Gehling will be closing out the show as Dr. 
Pomatter, the show’s male lead. Gehling 
graduated from Carnegie Mellon University’s 
drama program back in 2005 and was 
the first cast in the role of Dr. Pomatter 
in American Repertory Theater’s debut 
production of Waitress. Though it was a 
limited engagement, the show became sold 
out. This popularity facilitated the transition to 
Broadway’s Brooks Atkinson Theatre, where 
Gehling became part of Waitress’s original 
Broadway cast.
Although in hindsight there’s no doubt that 
Waitress has been a phenomenal success 
for all those involved, this certainly was not 
always present. “We never really knew that 
this was going to be a hit,” Gehling said. 
“When you start a new show, you never 
really have any kind of idea as to what its 
future might be. The majority of shows on 
Broadway do not recoup their investment 
or are a limited run, or just don’t find their 
audience in time.” In a spectacular turn 
of events, Waitress soared in popularity, 
managing to recoup its $12 million 
capitalization cost in under 10 months. “We 
happened to be in a show that just somehow 
captured the heart of the public at just the 
right time,” said Gehling. “We very quickly 
realized that we had something special on 
our hands, which,” he acknowledged, “was 
wild considering we opened the same year 
as Hamilton… So we got to just have the 
pleasure of enjoying the ride as it came.”
Drew Gehling eventually left the production, 
returning a couple of times throughout 
the three-and-a-half-year run to revisit his 
original character. On Oct. 30 of this year, 
Gehling made a final return to close the 
show as Dr. Pomatter. “Coming back, it’s 
really wonderful,” he reflected. “It’s a lot like 
coming home. Knowing there’s a specific 
end date is really, really comforting because 
it just allows us to fondly revisit the characters 
and the story that we created under no 
object about it running any longer than past 
January. So when it’s done, it’s done, and 
then we’ll have gotten to start it and finish it 
— That’s a unique honor.”
When asked to describe the show in a single 
word, Gehling, without hesitation, replied, 
“love.” He explained, “You gain a certain 
sense of community with a group of people 
that you go through something very, very 
intense with. It’s hard to pin down, but it does 
create a sense of instant family, where you 
are able to share in each others’ successes 
and cry with each other when failures occur. 
That that doesn’t happen in a lot of other 
professions. So for Waitress, specifically? It’s 
love.”
Overall, according to Gehling, “It has been 
an incredible ride, because we got to do 
some really, really, really wonderful and 
exciting things, right when the show opened. 
And then realizing that the show was going 
to be a success, you suddenly start to settle 
into the long haul, and then you have the 
experience of recording the cast album, and 
then listening to the cast album for the first 
time with the cast before it gets released, 
and then the cast album gets nominated for 
a Grammy Award, and the new guys get to 
share in the excitement, and the glory. And 
there’s honestly a strangeness in watching a 
national touring company rehearse and get 
ready to present to the rest of the country 
the show that you essentially created. That’s 
really pretty crazy. So it’s been an incredibly 
rewarding experience, almost without fail, 
and it will always hold a special place in my 
heart for that reason.”
Although Waitress may soon be closing 
on Broadway mainstage, it has inspired 
numerous productions all around the world, 
ranging from the current U.S. National 
Tour to the West End production in London 
and the upcoming Australian and Dutch 
productions (the latter of which will star 
Willemijn Verkaik as Jenna). An extraordinary 
slice of theatre, Waitress is a show that 
everyone should see while the opportunity is 
still there.
