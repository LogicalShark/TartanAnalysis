Waste code update will affect renters  
Peduto talks OnePGH at CMU panel
ADAM TUNNARD
News Editor
This past month, the Pittsburgh 
City Council unanimously passed 
changes to municipal waste code 
619 that will primarily affect rent-
ers and landlords in Pittsburgh. 
The changes will go into effect 
this summer. According to the 
of?ce of Erika Strassburger, who 
spearheaded the changes, the “ul-
timate goal is to make it easier for 
people to recycle and hopefully 
increase the amount of material 
that is recycled.”
Among the changes made, 
new provisions now require 
landlords to “provide both waste 
and recycling storage containers 
for their tenants, these must be 
watertight with close ?tting lids,” 
and to provide Pittsburgh speci?c 
recycling literature “to tenants as 
part of leases,” said Moira Egler, 
Councilperson Strassburger’s 
Chief of Staff, in an interview 
with The Tartan.
In addition to these changes, 
violations of the new waste 
code will now result in notices 
being sent to both the tenant 
and landlord and the mandate to 
recycle will be made more explicit 
in the code itself.
Small recycling changes have 
been clari?ed, as stated in the 
Pittsburgh Public Works waste 
regulations website.
These include the ability 
to place recycling out in blue 
translucent bags and the 
codi?cation of set out times as 
being “no sooner than 6 p.m. the 
day prior to collection, no later 
than 6 a.m. day of collection,” and 
bin retrieval times as being “by 10 
p.m. the day of collection.”
The legislation was an effort 
made in partnership with the 
City of Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Environmental Services and with 
the of?ce of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill 
Peduto. It passed unanimously in 
the council with few amendments.
The only pushback on the 
legislation came from a collection 
of residents that raised concerns 
about the code’s initial bin retriev-
al time, which was that bins had 
to be removed from side streets 
no later than 7:00 p.m. Some 
residents, like those working 
odd hours or with afternoon and 
night shifts, would be negatively 
affected by this set time.
Addressing these concerns, the 
latest possible retrieval time was 
pushed back to 10:00 p.m. in the 
now-passed legislation. Previous-
ly, the legislation did not enforce 
a speci?ed removal time.
In response to the prospect of 
rent increases due to the mandate 
that landlords provide waste 
bins, Egler stated that the of?ce 
“[hasn’t] heard concerns” about 
such an issue, and that “the con-
tainers are pretty reasonably 
priced.” Egler then noted that the 
mandate is speci?cally for “apart-
ment buildings with ?ve and fewer 
units,” and that these changes are 
“common sense provisions that

“Numbers do not speak for 
themselves,” said Sir David 
Spiegelhalter, a world-renowned 
statistician, to a crowd of near-
ly 100 professors and students 
who had gathered in McConomy 
Auditorium to hear him speak. 
“The stories we tell, the way 
they’re packaged makes all the dif-
ference to their emotional impact.”
We are living in the age of 
data. Technology plays a bigger 
role in people’s daily lives than 
ever before, and many of society’s 
core issues can be reframed as 
statistical problems. Yet it is also 
the age of misinformation, and 
the ?eld of statistics is facing more 
challenges than ever before.
Sir David Spiegelhalter’s lec-
ture on Monday, April 22, was 
the second installment of the Ste-
phen and Joyce Fienberg memo-
rial lecture series. Stephen Fien-
berg, who died of cancer in 2016, 
was the head of the Carnegie 
Mellon statistics department. 
He was highly respected and 
in?uential in the ?eld of statistics 
for his dedication to applying 
statistics for societal good. Joyce 
Fienberg, Stephen Fienbergs’s 
wife who perished in the Tree 
of Life synagogue shooting last 
Oct., worked as a researcher 
at the Learning Research and 
Development Center at the 
University of Pittsburgh and was a 
great supporter and friend of the 
statistics department at Carnegie 
Mellon.
“Steve sets a high bar for how 
statistic are communicated,” 
said Sir David Spiegelhalter. In 
his lecture, he focused on how 
statistics are manipulated for 
sensational and persuasive means. 
Spiegelhalter serves as a chair 
at the Winton Centre for Risk 
and Evidence Communication, 
which is part of the University 
of Cambridge’s department of 
mathematics. In his career, he 
has published over 200 papers 
and written several books. He has 
spent the last decade focusing 
on the application of statistics 
to everyday life, appearing in 
numerous T.V. specials on BBC 
and CNN to discuss issues re-
lated to probability and climate 
change. In 2014, he was knighted 
for his service to medical statistics, 
but he jokes that his greatest 
achievement is an appearance on 
the game show Winter Wipeout.
Spiegelhalter explained the 
pipeline of statistical evidence. 
Initially, data is collected by 
researchers and statisticians. 
Their research is then passed on 
to journals and the commissioners 
of the research, all of whom may 
have “selection biases.” Then the 
research is turned over to the

On Saturday, a gunman 
entered a synagogue in Califor-
nia shouting anti-Semitic slurs, 
and opened ?re with an AR-15 
style gun, as reported by The New 
York Times.
The shooting left a 60 year old 
woman dead, a rabbi wounded in 
his hand, and two others injured 
by shrapnel wounds.
It occurred on the Sabbath, 
and the last day of Passover, 
a week-long holiday that 
celebrates Jewish liberation 
from slavery.
The shooting took place at 
the Chabad of Poway. Poway is 
a suburban town about 25 miles 
north of San Diego.
The shooting occurred exactly 
six months after the Tree of Life 
synagogue shooting that jarred 
Pittsburgh and the Jewish com-
munity at large on Oct. 27, 2018. 
It is the most recent in a series of 
deadly attacks in houses of wor-
ship, including the mass shoot-
ing in mosques in New Zealand 
last month and the church bomb-
ings in Sri Lanka last week.
The gunman has been 
identi?ed as John Earnest, a 
19 year old from San Diego. He 
?ed the synagogue after the 
shooting, but soon after called 
the California Highway Patrol 
to report his location and was 
apprehended.
Police are reportedly 
investigating a manifesto that 
was posted on 8chan before 
the shooting, which is ?lled 
with white nationalist conspir-
acy theories and racist slurs, as 
reported by The New York Times.
Last year, a study released 
by the Anti-Defamation League 
found a 57 percent increase in 
anti-Semitic incidents.
Jonathan Greenblatt, the 
chief executive and national 
director of the Anti-Defamation 
League, told The New York Times 
that “This was a pointed attack 
on Chabad, on the visible Jewish 
community here, and this is a 
collective attack on all Jewish 
communities — this is anti-Sem-
itism unleashed.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto 
is continuing his effort to get 
his stalled fund for social and 
sustainable action in Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, off the ground.
A panel this past Thursday 
titled “The City of Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, and Alignment with the 
Sustainable Development Goals” 
brought this discussion to Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus. Speaking 
alongside Peduto was the head 
of Heinz College in Washington, 
D.C., Amb. Sarah Mendelson, 
serving as the panel moderator, 
and panelists Leah Lizarondo, 
Heinz alum and CEO of 412Food 
Rescue, Jerry MacCleary, CEO of 
materials company Covestro, and 
Anthony Pipa, Senior Fellow at the 
Brookings Institution.
The talk was framed around 
Pittsburgh’s interpretation of the 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs): 17 markers developed 
by the U.N. as a guide for global 
growth. These goals, Peduto 
claims, align with the 10 areas 
developed by the Rockefeller 
Foundation and the City of 
Pittsburgh for the city’s 12-year 
resiliency plan. These, in turn, be-
came Peduto’s proposed OnePGH 
fund, which would funnel money 
from the city, local nonpro?ts, 
and corporations to organizations 
working toward 47 planned proj-
ects.
Peduto emphasized the 
importance of action on the 
city level, citing a “vacuum of 
leadership in Washington.” 
However, according to Peduto, 
OnePGH is neccesary because the 
City of Pittsburgh does not have 
the leverage to act on its own. 
“[The projects] can’t happen un-
der old models. Old models are 
city government,” said Peduto.
“We don’t have the capacity 
to address hunger and poverty,” 
said Peduto, “but if we create a 
separate organization that then 
helps those that are on the ground 
addressing hunger and homeless-
ness, and being able to use that 
organization to prop up the non-
pro?ts throughout the city and 
this region, then we can get to our 
goals together.”

The Exchange ?nds new home by Purnell
Skinner denies State Dept. impropriety
Mill 19 soon to open, aiming to be an “extension of campus” 
MARIKA YANG
Publisher
As students walk around 
campus this fall, they’ll see a new 
buildup of traf?c outside the front 
entrance of the Purnell Center for 
the Arts. This is The Exchange 
Pop-Up Café, which has found a 
temporary home under the Pur-
nell portico while The Exchange’s 
original location in Posner Hall 
undergoes renovations.
One of the most popular dining 
options on campus, The Exchange 
will reopen in the renovated space 
on Nov. 4 with a new design em-
phasizing speed of service and 
expanded seating. It will feature 
an open kitchen, coffee bar, and 
more grab-and-go menu options. 
At the start of the semester, the 
pop-up was operated in a tent at 
the front of Merson Courtyard 
outside the Cohon Center. The 
current location outside Purnell 
provides better cover, and will 
remain open until Oct., weather 
permitting.
Turnout has been good 
through the ?rst three weeks 
of the semester. Dave Collins, 
who manned the register at The 
Exchange in Posner, also does so at 
the pop-up, making him a familiar 
face for regular customers over 
the years.
“Students from the School of 
Drama love that we’re so close 
now,” Collins said in an interview 
with The Tartan. “People come 
from all over campus because we 
have a good reputation. We’re 
popular with all the sports teams, 
soccer players. [It’s a] diverse 
group that comes here.”
While some returning students 
make their way across campus to 
grab their sandwich order at pop-
up, ?rst-years have no experience 
with the original café. First-year 
drama student Bahaar Esfahani 
appreciates its close proximity to 
her classes in Purnell, but does 
not think she will make the trek 
to Posner when the pop-up closes 
and the original location reopens.
“I literally have no idea where 
it used to be,” said Esfahani. “I 
walk out of Purnell, and [the pop-
up is] right here. The location’s 
really convenient because I walk 
out of class, I’m hungry, and it’s 
right here.”
This is also the case for Wael

Dr. Kiron Skinner is back on 
campus as Director of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Center for International 
Relations and Politics after she 
was ?red from her position as 
Director of Policy Planning at the 
Department of State.
Politico reported that her 
?ring came as a result of an 
“abusive” management style, but 
in an interview with The Tartan 
this week, Skinner denies these 
allegations.
Skinner had taken a leave from 
her post at Carnegie Mellon last 
September to pursue what she 
called her “?rst real deep dive 
into government.” She’s worked 
as a foreign policy advisor to the 
George Bush, Newt Gingrich, 
and Mitt Romney presidential 
campaigns, and served as part of 
Donald Trump’s transition team 
in 2016, but this was her “?rst real 
day job” in government, she said 
in an interview with The Tartan.
The allegations made by 
anonymous state department 
sources in Politco include Skinner 
making homophobic remarks, 
accusing staff of having affairs, 
and abusing her authority. Several 
members of Skinner’s staff had al-
legedly threatened to quit if she 
was not ?red, according to a senior 
State Department of?cial.
At the time of her ?ring, Skinner 
did not immediately respond to 
requests for comment. Now, she 
denies making any homophobic 
remarks, and characterizes some 
of the reporting as being “out of 
context.” “I was trying to build 
a very different type of of?ce,” 
Skinner said. “There were people 
that didn’t like how I was doing 
things.”
Throughout her career, Skinner 
says, she’s never been accused of 
any impropriety. She also notes 
that no of?cial State Department 
investigation was made prior 
to her ?ring. “You can’t be at 
an elite university and be a big 
homophobe,” she said.
Several people came to 
Skinner’s defense over these 
reports, including Carnegie 
Mellon professor and Director of 
the Undergraduate Economics 
Program Dr. Carol Goldburg, who 
told Breitbart News that after 
working with Skinner for over 10 
years, she had “never observed 
language or behavior that could 
be considered discriminatory.” 
Goldburg continued, “As one 
of the few out lesbians on our 
campus, I am not tone-deaf to even 
subtle forms of discrimination 
such as micro-aggressions, and 
can categorically state that Kiron 
Skinner does not engage in such 
behaviors.”
Skinner says that most of the 
internal con?ict stemmed from her 
Dr. Kiron Skinner, now returned to her post at Carnegie Mellon, was fired from her State Department position this Aug.

Soon, Carnegie Mellon’s 
Manufacturing Futures Initiative 
(MFI) and Carnegie Mellon 
partner Advanced Robotics for 
Manufacturing (ARM) will occupy 
a new facility, Mill 19, alongside 
other manufacturers. The facility 
will be a place for MFI and ARM to 
collaborate, as well as many other 
purposes.
Mill 19, owned by the 
Regional Industrial Development 
Corporation (RIDC), is situated 
in Hazelwood Green, a 178-acre 
site once home to Pittsburgh’s 
leading steel mills. Now, much of 
Mill 19 will be leased to Carnegie 
Mellon, and a prospective 8.3-acre 
expansion in Hazelwood Green is 
in Carnegie Mellon’s hands. Both 
MFI and ARM will be situated on 
the ?rst and second ?oor of the 
building, occupying nearly 60,000 
square feet.
Carnegie Mellon has had its 
sights on the area since before 
Mill 19 was built, signing MFI and 
ARM on as anchor tenants before 
the ?rst building had even been 
constructed. In total, Mill 19 will 
be comprised of three buildings, 
forming a 264,000 square foot 
complex.
Particularly unique to Mill 19’s 
architecture is that the steel frame 
of its former steel mill will be 
maintained. The new construction 
of Mill 19 is done entirely within 
the steel frame, something 
Carnegie Mellon says symbolizes 
the industrial past and future of 
Pittsburgh.
As for Carnegie Mellon and its 
partners’ initiatives, the facility 
will be a place to prototype and ad-
vance new technologies for manu-
facturing. Previously, work of this 
sort was being done by ARM at 
Carnegie Mellon’s Lawrenceville-
based National Robotics Engineer-
ing Center (NREC).
The creation of ARM happens 
to have been catalyzed by 
Carnegie Mellon itself. According 
to Jay Douglass, Chief Operating 
Of?cer for ARM, it was Carnegie 
Mellon that authored the proposal 
which resulted in ARM’s creation 
by the United States’ Department 
of Defense. To date, ARM has 
funded over 40 projects, three of 
which have been in collaboration 
with Carnegie Mellon.
Douglass stated, “Our mission 
is to fund development projects 
that can be shared with our

turing competitiveness forward.” 
He made sure to note that “CMU 
is one of the top robotics research 
institutions in the world. As such, 
it makes great sense for us to be 
partnered.”
On future plans for Mill 19, 
Douglass said, “We are going to 
be conducting our own research 
and development in robotics for

Skinner returns to IPS from State Department
Outside Purnell, The Exchange adapts
big plans for the Of?ce of Policy 
Planning. She says she entered an 
of?ce that had little power, and was 
“building [it] up from the ground, 
and also bringing a whole different 
perspective,” while trying to “build 
relationships around me,” and 
“doing it not fully staffed.”
As Director of Policy Planning, 
Skinner under Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo, Skinner was 
reportedly working to advance 
Donald Trump’s “America First” 
foreign policy agenda and to 
diversify the State Department, 
with more hires that spoke the 
language of regions of interest 
and hires from academia. To this, 
Skinner says, “I did rub some 
people the wrong way, but I came 
from a whole different world.”
Despite her ?ring from the 
Trump administration, Skinner 
holds steadfast to what she calls 
the “Trump Doctrine” for foreign 
policy. She characterizes it as 
“an attempt to match American 
capabilities to new geopolitical 
realities.” “When [Trump] calls it 
America First, he means putting 
national interest at the center,” 
Skinner said.
The politics of the Trump 
presidency address “the anxiety 
of where we’re going and what 
we will be,” Skinner said. In the 
geopolitical sphere, “we just have 
more to worry about now, which 
means diplomacy matters more 
now.”
Skinner stresses that China 
continues to grow as an adversary 
to the United States, and mentions 
that “when you look at China 
and all those who have nuclear 
weapons, they’re from the global 
south.” Because of this, “we need 
diverse teams of people who are 
addressing these things,” Skinner 
said.
Skinner’s comments on 
China’s expanding power have 
led to pushback. At a public 
talk in Washington this May, 
Skinner said, “this is a ?ght with 
a really different civilization 
and a different ideology, and 
the United States hasn’t had that 
before. The Soviet Union and that 
competition, in a way, it was a 
?ght within the Western family.” 
With China, in contrast, “it’s 
the ?rst time that we will have a 
great power competitor that is not 
Caucasian.”
This statement led to criticism. 
A Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
for China called it “simply absurd 
and utterly unacceptable.” An 
op-ed in The Tartan written by a 
Chinese doctoral student stated, 
“I am offended by her claim that 
since China is not a country of 
Caucasians, it should be treated 
differently from other ‘white’ 
countries by the U.S.”
To this, Skinner says: “Did I 
misspeak? Sure.” The criticism 
“was really legitimate… it’s a 
legitimate discussion,” Skinner 
said. Still, she clarifies that 
“China is very different than 
other competitors we have had” 
and that “we have to take China 
on its own terms. A lot more 
seriously.”
Away from the politics of 
Washington, D.C., Skinner looks 
forward to leading the Center 
for International Relations and 
Politics into the future. She stresses 
the importance of facilitating the 
range of classes necessary to give 
students a “broad understanding 
of American politics and the 
international sphere.” Skinner 
also looks forward to “growing 
within the new undergraduate 
major in Economics and Politics,” 
a Bachelors of Science degree co-
sponsored with the Tepper School 
of Business coming this fall. It will 
be the ?rst co-sponsored major 
within the Institute for Politics and 
Strategy.
The responsibility to present 
different ideas to undergraduates 
cannot be understated, Skinner 
says. After all, the department is 
“trying to create the next President 
of the United States and the next 
set of cabinet members.”

test cells for a variety of robotics 
applications. We all plan to 
provide a de-risking capability for 
some of our local members as well 
as the [Department of Defense]. 
Our roommate here at Mill 19 is 
the CMU Manufacturing Futures 
Initiative, and we have several 
projects planned to collaborate 
on with them.”
With Carnegie Mellon, ARM 
will be working on a set of training 
curriculum for robotic techni-
cians and a metal grinding appli-
cation for tight spaces, Douglass 
told The Tartan. On a broader 
scale, ARM has helped Carnegie 
Mellon and the city of Pittsburgh 
become leaders in manufacturing 
innovation, focused on tech-
nologies like AI, autonomy, 3D 
printing, and robotics.
MFI director Gary Fedder 
told The Tartan that the MFI 
will be running major advanced 
manufacturing projects driven by 
industry needs, requiring industry 
collaboration. Partner companies 
at Mill 19 will be donating or 
consigning equipment as well as 
sponsoring projects.
“Many of these projects will 
take the form of ‘workcells’ 
where some problem in robotics 
or automation of manufacturing 
is being explored and ‘de-risked’ 
for eventual industry use,” said 
Fedder. “CMU envisions that 
these workcells not only will 
serve the needs of the immediate 
project, but also serve as a testbed 
resource for secondary spin-off 
projects — for example in ‘digital 
twinning’ technology, in human-
robot interaction, in energy use, 
in cybersecurity, or in workforce 
development.”
While MFI partner ARM has 
made good use of the NREC, 
Fedder explained the uniqueness 
of Mill 19: “An important 
distinction between Mill 19 and 
NREC is the intent that Mill 19 is 
a more open facility that is seen 
as an extension of campus. We 
envision substantial numbers 
of undergraduate and graduate 
students doing research at Mill 
19. Historically, while NREC has 
run a host of exciting projects, 
much of its focus has been on 
the development of autonomous 
platforms for all sorts of sectors: 
e.g., military, autonomous 
vehicles, mining, construction, 
and farming.”
On the partnership between 
MFI and ARM, Fedder said, 
“Our two organizations are 
complementary and synergistic. 
CMU researchers primarily work 
to discover, invent and innovate 
to explore new ideas and areas. 
ARM’s mission is to bridge the 
gap between ideas and inventions 
to de-risk technology for manu-
facturers. So the combination of 
ARM and CMU at Mill 19 is quite 
powerful.”

most of his time on campus in the 
Gates Center. “I only discovered it 
this week,” he said.
While the new location has 
brought new customers, who 
wouldn’t otherwise get their 
lunches from The Exchange, the 
small nature of the pop-up means 
that there are some limitations to 
their menu. Despite this, they’re 
continuing to offer a wide variety 
of options, including breakfast, 
deli, and off-the-grill sandwiches, 
hot entrée and pasta specials, as 
well as hot coffee.
“There are [limitations] 
because we don’t have the stor-
age,” said Collins. “We don’t have 
the refrigeration here to offer our 
full menu, but try to offer what we 
know is popular.”

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
CMU’s impact on the climate
The world is on ?re, and the 
people with power are holding the 
gas can and the match.
This is hardly a metaphor. The 
people most responsible for the 
climate catastrophe, which has 
stopped knocking at our door and is 
now beating it down, are fossil fuel 
executives and those helping them 
in their mission to choke the entire 
world in ever-darker clouds of 
smoke. That category also includes 
every politician who refuses to 
speak out against these obscenely 
rich ?gures, every powerful 
person taking their money to build 
boxy glass edi?ces on hillsides in 
western Pennsylvania cities, and 
the consultants and marketing 
specialists selling “clean” coal, 
or “natural” gas, or “energy 
independence,” while more than 
one million species face extinction. 
Climate change is forcing millions 
to ?ee their homes, and all of 
us are living in a hotter, more 
unpredictable planet.
Climate change is already 
reshaping the dynamics of 
our world, and it’s naïve to 
think that anything short of 
revolutionary political change 
will alter its destruction. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) concluded 
in their 2018 report that “the 
report ?nds that limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C would require 
‘rapid and far-reaching’ transitions 
in land, energy, industry, buildings, 
transport, and cities,” according 
to a summary released by the 
IPCC. The report also warns that 
“a number of climate change 
impacts…could be avoided by 
limiting global warming to 1.5°C 
compared to 2°C, or more. For 
instance, by 2100, global sea 
level rise would be 10 cm lower 
with global warming of 1.5°C 
compared with 2°C. The likelihood 
of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in 
summer would be once per century 
with global warming of 1.5°C, 
compared with at least once per 
decade with 2°C. Coral reefs would 
decline by 70-90 percent with 
global warming of 1.5°C, where 
virtually all (> 99 percent) would 
be lost with 2°C.” Such “rapid and 
far-reaching” transitions will not be 
accomplished by policies like not 
using plastic straws. They won’t be 
accomplished by a carbon tax, or 
by “market-based solutions,” or by 
asking companies worth billions of 
dollars to please, maybe, pump less 
oil out of the planet.
Universities in general, 
including Carnegie Mellon 
University, are playing both sides. 
Provost Jim Garrett sent an email on 
Sept. 9 “announcing the creation of 
a new campus-wide Sustainability 
Initiative,” which would “be 
organized around objectives 
that strengthen our university’s 
commitment to sustainability; 
elevate Carnegie Mellon’s 
engagement with the United 
Nation’s Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), a shared blueprint 
for sustainability adopted by 
countries, cities and universities 
such as ours; and improve 
coordination of our sustainability 
education, research, and practices 
among CMU students, faculty, staff 
and local community members.” 
Meanwhile, the university takes 
money from the descendants 
of oil tycoons like Wilton E. 
Scott, whose “chief love in the 
energy business was exploration: 
the adventure of ?nding and 
developing new sources of oil and 
gas,” according to his obituary. The 
Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy 
Innovation “seeks to optimize 
energy resources, reduce the 
environmental impacts of energy 
production and use, and develop 
breakthrough technologies 
and solutions that will have a 
meaningful global impact and 
to accelerate the transition to a 
sustainable, low carbon energy 
future.” Meanwhile, the Institute 
boasts a Fossil Fuel Experts page, 
and the university has not divested 
its $2.36 billion dollar endowment 
from fossil fuels.
Institutions have bigger impacts 
than individuals. Therefore, 
institutional changes have bigger 
effects than individual changes. 
That being said, individual change 
is still change, and you really 
should stop using so much plastic 
(the tap water is literally ?ne; 
invest in a ?lter if it brings you 
comfort), driving everywhere, 
taking international ?ights, and 
eating meat. All well and good, and 
every little bit helps. But no matter 
how much you deprive yourself, 
no matter how many plastic straws 
you don’t use, the United States 
military this year alone will release 
more greenhouse gases than the 
entire country of Portugal.
We will not mitigate climate 
change solely with our reusable 
packaging and Meatless Mondays. 
It will take massive public action, 
and a radical reimagining of our 
society, to force these institutions 
to act. What will a world look like 
without cars spewing pollutants 
into the air, coal-?red power plants 
and mountaintop removal, leaky 
pipelines and toxic water, a few 
nihilistic frackers who are holding 
our lives in their hands? We could 
have ?xed this decades ago, but 
Exxon and their close corporate 
friends are willing to kill the world 
for pro?t.
It’s never too late to do 
something. But instead of buying 
a new set of eco-friendly storage 
containers, why don’t you donate 
to one of the groups combating 
deforestation in the Amazon? 
Or work in your community, 
building connections with the 
people around you, working 
for a broader goal than just 
temporarily alleviating your guilt 
at a lifestyle of consumption and 
waste? Buying something won’t 
?x anything. Organizing will. The 
Fridays for Future movement, 
which started when then-15-year-
old Greta Thunberg sat outside 
the Swedish parliament building 
“every schoolday for three weeks, 
to protest against the lack of action 
on the climate crisis,” has grown to 
an international movement, with 
chapters in 29 countries. Extinction 
Rebellion has held actions around 
the world, from die-ins to blocking 
bridges. These organizations are 
just a few of the partners in the 
Global Climate Strike, which will 
be held on Sept. 20 and 27. Fridays 
for Future PGH will be hosting an 
action at the City-County Building, 
414 Grant St, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 
at 12:00 p.m. on Sept. 20. It will 
take all of us to make the world 
better, so let’s start now.

During the last few weeks of 
Aug., you may have seen your 
Instagram story feed transform 
before your eyes. Your friends’ 
Instagram stories, normally 
containing memes and pictures 
of people’s dinners, suddenly 
featured memes, pictures of 
people’s dinners, and panic over 
the Amazon rainforest. The 
Amazon rainforest is burning. If 
you checked the news, browsed 
social media, or talked to anyone 
during the month of August, 
chances are you’re painfully aware 
of this fact.
Cyberactivism has been a good 
start to help increase awareness of 
this environmental catastrophe. In 
order for it to be effective, however, 
it must be followed by concrete 
action. Overall, cyberactivism has 
failed to inspire mass action, as it 
has skimmed over the likely cause 
of the ?res: animal agriculture.
NASA’s Earth Observatory has 
analyzed the timing, location, and 
intensity of the ?res, and found that 
these patterns indicate deliberate 
land clearing. In other words, 
humans have been intentionally 
starting ?res to clear up space 
for industry. Though Amazonian 
deforestation is a multifaceted 
issue, about 80 percent of current 
deforestation in Amazon countries 
is carried out to increase beef 
production, according to Yale 
University’s Global Forest Atlas.
Animal agriculture is the 
leading cause of deforestation in 
the Amazon, and as such, is the 
probable cause of many of the 2019 
?res. This presents an inconvenient 
truth for many Americans. Some 
of America’s largest corporations, 
such as Costco, McDonald’s, and 
Walmart, sell Amazonian beef to 
the public. Therefore, veganism, or 
reduced beef consumption at the 
very least, is a ?tting solution to this 
environmental crisis. Less demand 
for beef (and its byproducts) 
would decrease the demand for 
Amazonian land, and reduce the 
need for deforestation.
Much anti-vegan rhetoric 
focuses on the impact of soy 
production on the Amazon. 
Soybean production is a major 
threat to the Amazon rainforest 
but is secondary to livestock 
production. Further, 80 percent 
of soybeans produced worldwide 
is consumed by livestock. The 
environmental burden proposed by 
soybeans should not be discounted, 
but rather it should be looked at as 
a result of livestock production.
As the ?res in the Amazon rage 
on, cyberactivism is beginning 
to die down. In order to ?ght 
deforestation and prevent further 
?res, the demand for Amazonian 
land must be reduced. We must 
do so by reducing the demand for 
Amazonian-raised beef and other 
cattle products.
Cyberactivism inadequate alone

Last Thursday, Saturday Night 
Live announced its three newest 
cast members. Within hours, 
videos were uncovered revealing 
that one of them, Shane Gillis, 
used racial slurs while appearing 
on a podcast, insisted on including 
bigoted comments in his standup 
routine, and called a Democratic 
presidential candidate a “Jew 
c***k”.
While the comedian may lose 
his opportunity to appear on 
SNL, this has already become 
yet another occasion for people 
to express outrage against the 
outrage a condemnation of “cancel 
culture” destroying people’s lives. 
But even if Gillis is removed from 
SNL’s lineup, I argue that it would 
be an exception that demonstrates 
the overall lack of a predominant 
cancel culture.
For someone to be canceled, 
it means that their livelihood is 
lost or permanently damaged 
due to a public backlash against 
something they did or said that 
was perceived as objectionable. 
If people are going to assert that 
a Twitter army of “politically 
correct” “social justice warriors” 
is destroying lives with their 
purity tests and barrages of hate, 
then we must have some evidence 
of it destroying lives, right? For 
a cancel culture to exist in any 
substantive way, people must be 
getting canceled.
Whenever I ask for examples, 
people mention Aziz Ansari (you 
can watch his July standup special 
on Net?ix), Kevin Hart (according 
to IMDb he is acting in at least four 
upcoming productions), or James 
Gunn (he has now written the 
script for The Suicide Squad and 
has been rehired to Guardians of 
the Galaxy Vol. 3). None of their 
stories are examples of cancel 
culture at work.
While ?gures such as Harvey 
Weinstein and Bill Cosby 
have ended their careers from 
their criminal acts, the public 
response to their behavior was 
substantively different from what 
people imagine politically correct 
“cancel culture” to be. The only 
clear-cut example I’ve seen of 
a successful “canceling” was of 
Rosanne Barr being ?red from her 
show following her racist tweets 
targeting a former Obama aide, 
but even so, she may ?nd a new 
audience in time.
For every actor, musician, and 
personality who faced incidents 
where it appeared that they were 
being “canceled,” practically all 
of them either stayed intact or 
recovered one way or another. 
Beauty personality James 
Charles has regained most of 
the subscribers he lost since he 
was supposedly canceled. Viner 
turned YouTube personality Logan 
Paul suffered a massive backlash 
at the beginning of 2018 over 
his “suicide forest” video, but 
since then has almost reached 20 
million YouTube subscribers and 
got away with “going gay” for a 
month earlier this year.
Rapper XXXTentacion had his 
songs returned to Spotify’s playlists 
while he was being prosecuting for 
domestic violence. Even gaming 
YouTuber ProJared could make 
a comeback after controversies 
surrounding soliciting nude 
photographs from minors and an 
alleged affair. And none of this is 
mentioning the numerous public 
?gures who haven’t suffered 
any tangible damage after being 
“canceled.”
It seems that a lot of the 
discussion around cancel culture 
is more “looks like so-and-
so is getting canceled” than 
anyone actually being canceled. 
PewDiePie? Canceled. Kanye 
West? Canceled. Taylor Swift? 
Canceled. Half of the SNL cast 
members? Canceled. Kanye 
West? Canceled again. Woody 
Allen? Canceled. Every actor 
who’s played a character of a 
different ethnicity? All supposedly 
canceled. It’s as though the source 
of cancel culture’s perceived power 
is people repeatedly asserting how 
powerful and pervasive it is.
A counterpoint to this is that 
the outrage people on social 
media display while targeting 
someone shows the power of 
cancel culture when that target is 
bullied off the platform, but that’s 
not what cancel culture is; that’s 
cyberbullying. Cyberbullying 
can, but not necessarily, be a 
component of cancellation. It is 
only a suf?cient component of 
canceling someone if the target’s 
livelihood is actually threatened 
by leaving the platform. I wouldn’t 
call The New York Times opinion 
columnist Bret Stephens canceled 
after he was bullied off of Twitter 
for taking offense to being called a 
bedbug.
But what other explanation is 
there for all the attention paid to 
cancel culture, and the attacks 
on various public ?gures? I will 
refer people to what Bloomberg 
Opinion columnist Noah Smith 
dubbed “the Shouting Class.” 
This is generally a small subset 
of people on social media who 
spend their time on social being 
vocally outraged about something 
or someone. They might be part 
of the 10 percent of Twitter users 
who send 80 percent of all tweets, 
or the people who mobilize the 
cancel hashtags.
Regardless, this is an incredibly 
small group of people — and unless 
you want to “cancel” the Shouting 
Class, they won’t be going away 
without systematic changes to 
how social media functions, with 
its mechanisms for elevating 
certain types of voices over others. 
What we can do now, however, is 
remind ourselves that the people 
trying to use years-old tweets to 
get someone ?red don’t represent 
any society at large, and we must 
resist giving them the oxygen that 
social media platforms tend to 
want us to give them.
However, it’s also important 
to acknowledge that when 
the discourse around who the 
Shouting Class is going after enters 
the general public, that person is 
likely receiving the scrutiny and 
accountability that is warranted; 
at that point it’s out of the Shouting 
Class’s control. Whatever happens 
to Shane Gillis’s future at SNL is up 
to the show’s powerful producer 
Lorne Michaels now.
As I ?nish this, it appears 
that there’s new reporting on a 
corroborated sexual misconduct 
allegation against Justice Brett 
Kavanaugh during his time at Yale. 
I wonder if the almighty cancel 
culture will actually get him this 
time.
There is actually no real “cancel culture”

Accounting for your life: growth
FRANK HU
Operations Manager
Last time on Accounting for 
Your Life, we talked about the 
importance of saving, and some 
general guidelines on how to 
save. Even though we painted in 
very broad strokes, I hope that 
those principles at least gave 
you some food for thought and 
helped you start to think about 
how to reshape your views on 
spending and saving.
But all this talk about saving 
raises another big question: after 
your money makes it through 
the grueling gauntlet of taxes, 
bills, and unexpected expenses 
into your “savings” category, 
where should you put it? Should 
you keep it in the bank? Should 
you invest it all in gold? Should 
you fill a vault with it and go 
swimming like Scrooge McDuck?
More important than simply 
having a lot of cash saved up is 
ensuring that that money grows 
over time. Choosing where 
you put your money can have 
a big impact on your financial 
wellness down the line, so 
making the right choices now 
can help your wealth compound 
and grow significantly over time.
Before we talk about the 
options that exist, it’s worthwhile 
to consider why we want our 
money to grow over time instead 
of just sitting in a dark vault. Is 
it because we like seeing larger 
and larger numbers in our bank 
account? Sure, everyone loves 
seeing bigger numbers. However, 
the far more pressing concern is 
that you want to make sure that 
the money you saved maintains 
its buying power.
We often hear it said that 
25 years ago, $20 could buy 
a lot more than $20 today. 
Considering that the U.S. 
economy has a habit of heading 
in an expansionary direction, 
it’ll probably buy even less 25 
years from now. This is because 
economies that are doing well 
tend to experience inflation, 
which means that prices for 
goods and services tend to go up. 
Runaway inflation is a bad sign, 
but a modest rate of inflation 
is unavoidable. That’s why the 
Federal Reserve tries to manage 
the inflation rate to be around 
two percent a year.
If you just save your money 
and put it somewhere safe, it’s 
actually becoming less valuable 
as time goes on. Sure, that $100 
in your savings account is still 
going to be $100 in the year 
2040, but it’s not going to go 
as far as it would have in the 
year 2019. For that reason, it’s 
important to grow savings rather 
than just have savings. So what 
are your options for where to 
stash your stacks?
For those of you closer to 
broaching full-on adulthood 
and on the verge of entering 
the workforce, a 401k and an 
Individual Retirement Account 
(IRA) should be your first 
considerations for storing 
savings. Setting aside a portion 
of your paycheck to directly 
deposit into your 401k or IRA is 
a great way to ensure that the 
money you set aside grows over 
time. Some employers match 
your contributions to your 401k, 
which just means more money 
for you, and in the case of IRAs, 
you can often write off your 
contributions as a tax deduction.
However, do keep in mind 
that these accounts are not like 
traditional savings accounts: 
for a 401k, you cannot make 
direct contributions and there 
are steep penalties for early 
withdrawals before the age of 
59 and a half, the official age for 
retirement as set by the IRS. And 
for an IRA, though you can make 
direct contributions and have as 
many accounts as you want, you 
cannot exceed the federal limit of 
$6,000 a year as of 2019. We will 
talk more about these retirement 
accounts later in the series.
For those of you who are 
still in college or the awkward 
transition between student and 
adult, a good place to store 
savings would be an online 
bank account, which often 
boasts higher interest rates than 
traditional brick-and-mortar 
banks. In most cases, banks may 
offer a pitiful interest rate on 
their savings accounts, often less 
than one percent compounded 
monthly.
By contrast, there are a lot of 
banks that offer savings accounts 
with a two percent or higher 
interest rate, compounded daily. 
I’m no mathematician, but it’s 
clear that the second option is 
better.
How is it that these online 
banks can afford such high 
interest rates? Part of the reason 
is that they don’t have as much 
overhead as established banks 
such as PNC, Wells Fargo, or 
Bank of America do. Most of 
their business is done virtually, 
so there’s no need for expensive 
office buildings and large 
management teams across the 
U.S. In some ways, you can 
see the rise of online banks as 
a natural consequence of the 
internet.
Transferring your money to 
an online bank is straightforward 
enough in that you just open an 
account and transfer from an 
existing account. Choosing the 
right bank is up to you, though 
keep in mind that most online 
banks do not offer checking 
services comparable to those 
of established branches, so 
accessing your money from an 
ATM or using a bank-issued 
debit card might be out of the 
question. In that sense, online 
bank accounts are best viewed 
as a receptacle for money where 
liquidity is not a concern, and 
you should still have a regular 
checking account for day-to-day 
expenses.
A third option is a certificate 
of deposits (CDs) and timed 
savings accounts. These offer 
even higher rates, sometimes 
as high as three percent, but 
the catch is that you cannot 
access your money at all for a 
period. Essentially, you’re giving 
the bank your money with the 
promise that they can use it and 
lend it however they want, and 
in return, they’ll pay you back 
the principal plus interest. If 
you’re sure that you don’t need 
the money for a while, then 
timed savings and CDs can yield 
even higher returns.
Now that you’ve saved some 
money and have a place to put 
it where it can grow, you’re 
probably feeling pretty good 
about the future. But if you 
consider the big picture, we can 
do better. With a two-to-three 
percent interest rate, an online 
savings account might help you 
keep pace with inflation, but 
you’ll never outperform it by a 
decent margin. So rather than 
just saving and stashing, we’ll 
begin tackling our biggest and 
most important topic starting 
with the next issue: how to 
invest.
LIKHITHA CHINTAREDDY
Staffwriter
A couple months ago, I 
wrote an article on the Indian 
midterm elections that had just 
taken place. The results were 
stunning. The Indian National 
Congress Party (Congress) 
had defeated the Bharatiya 
Janata Party (BJP) in the Hindi 
heartland, equivalent to the 
U.S.’s rust belt, leading political 
analysts to speculate that the 
tide has turned in Congress’ 
favor.
They had reason to believe 
so: a massive defeat in an elec-
tion just six months before the 
general elections, the slowing 
economy, growing unemploy-
ment, disillusionment due to 
unfulfilled poll-time promises, 
and growing momentum among 
the opposition parties had all 
culminated in the form of that 
upset for the BJP. The article 
that I wrote back in January 
took a neutral view on the issue 
of whether Modi will win a sec-
ond term, conceding that it may 
not be the landslide victory that 
people thought it would be in 
2014, but that he had a fair shot 
at winning it, considering the 
fact that he and his right-hand-
man, Amit Shah, combined are 
an election machine.
General elections in India 
are the largest democratic 
exercise in the world. As they 
approached, the tide had 
turned back in the BJP’s favor, 
and most polls predicted a BJP 
win. They were all right. Modi 
did win — and with a landslide 
margin at that, beating even 
my expectations that the 
opposition might just put up a 
spirited fight at the very least. 
BJP increased its Lok Sabha 
(the Lower Chamber) tally 
from 282 to a whopping 303 
seats. The National Democratic 
Alliance (NDA) led by the BJP 
stands at 353 of the 543 elected 
seats.
For a party that had lost 
elections in three of its 
homebase states only 6 months 
ago, this was a spectacular win. 
Many of the issues that caused 
the BJP’s defeat in December 
2018 still existed in April and 
May 2019, and yet they won. 
Some key events played a major 
role in ensuring the success of 
BJP: issues of national security, 
caste dynamics, and fractured 
opposition, to list a few. The 
election also debunked several 
expectations of what would 
take place, namely that a large 
number of religious minorities 
would vote in BJP’s favor this 
time as well. This baffled 
several analysts who had 
speculated that persecution 
of religious minorities by 
right-wing fringe groups, and 
disappointing policies related 
to women would translate into 
votes for the Opposition. The 
BJP’s carefully-built coalitions 
in different states with local 
parties, the intricate caste 
and religious calculations 
before fielding candidates in 
constituencies all paid off in 
their favor, as the Opposition 
was left unprepared and in 
disarray.
BJP’s second win has 
proved that Indians, though 
disgruntled over our apathetic 
economy, are willing to ignore 
it for the sake of national 
security. The terror attacks 
in the Jammu and Kashmir 
states which killed Indian army 
soldiers and the retaliatory 
airstrikes in Pakistan conducted 
by India in February led to 
increased support for the BJP 
in the run-up to the elections. 
Social media sites saw renewed 
activity as people from both 
countries faced off in the 
virtual world, trading insults, 
even as military and diplomatic 
tensions rode up. The way the 
situation de-escalated later 
solidified the party’s support 
base and moderates who were 
concerned about the economic 
issues plaguing the country put 
those on the back burner in the 
interest of national security.
Modi is a charismatic leader 
who knows how to build his 
brand as a strong-man, with 
even his staunchest opponents 
agreeing on that. He also 
has the backing of one of the 
world’s largest grassroots-level 
organizations in Rashtriya 
Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a 
Hindu right-wing ideological 
organization. BJP is the political 
arm of the RSS, and Modi 
himself is an RSS alum. Having 
a dedicated grassroots level 
organization at the national 
level that deploys its dedicated 
volunteers for campaign work 
at a local level, visiting the 
homes of people in different 
constituencies, personally 
listening to their grievances, 
is a massive advantage, one 
that none of the other parties 
currently enjoy.
Perhaps the Congress Party 
had that advantage a couple of 
decades ago, but the party is 
now aging, most of its leaders 
hovering around 65. This is 
especially old considering 
India has the largest youth 
population in the world right 
now. The Congress party is a 
slow, aging party that refuses 
to play catch up with new 
methods of electioneering, like 
social media or data analytics. 
It’s another advantage that the 
BJP enjoys, thanks to RSS’s 
large youth base.
Caste dynamics came into 
play as well, as I had predicted 
in my January article. Without 
getting into the nitty-gritty of 
the complicated caste system 
in India, the introduction of 
10 percent reservations to 
upper-caste people (basically 
increasing affirmative action 
for upper-caste people) swayed 
a significant number of upper-
caste votes to BJP.
The election results 
surprised me not so much 
by the end result as by its 
overwhelming mandate for 
the BJP. Of course, I continue 
to have concerns with many of 
the government’s policies. As a 
recession nears, that concern 
only grows. But I choose to give 
them the benefit of the doubt.
I continue to be peeved by 
Atishi Marlena’s loss in the 
East Delhi constituency to 
BJP’s Gautam Gambhir. Atishi 
has been credited with Delhi’s 
education policy reforms and 
worked for an honorarium 
amount of 1 Rupee (0.014 
USD). Yet she lost to Gambhir, 
a former cricketer. In that 
moment, and even now, it 
feels to me like the loss of 
meritocracy.
But I’m still optimistic about 
the future of democracy in 
India, and as a new generation 
comes of age, hopefully, we 
will start taking over the reins 
and lead the country to a better 
future.

Diabetes affects over 30 
million Americans, and millions 
more around the world. These 
individuals must inject insulin, 
sometimes as often as four times 
per day, to treat their condition. 
Scientists have long searched for 
a method of delivering insulin 
orally, and Carnegie Mellon 
researchers may have found an 
answer — in strawberries.
Nicholas Lamson, a research 
assistant who worked on the 
project, explained in a press 
release, “The problem with 
insulin is that it’s a protein. The 
human stomach is very adept at 
breaking down proteins — such 
as with food.”
Insulin must be absorbed by 
the small intestine in order for it 
to function effectively in a thera-
peutic setting. Pills are developed 
to encapsulate insulin molecules 
so that they are fully intact during 
absorption. However, if the 
proteins that protect the insulin 
are completely undigested by 
the time they arrive in the small 
intestine, they are too large to 
absorbed into the bloodstream. 
On the other hand, chemicals 
that force the small intestine’s 
pores to open often cause lasting 
damage.
“We took around 110 fruits 
and vegetables and screened 
them for an ability to open up 
the gaps between the cells of the 
intestine wide enough to allow 
the insulin to pass through,” said 
associate professor of chemical 
engineering Kathryn Whitehead 
in a press release.
As it turns out, strawberries 
contain a compound that can 
enlarge intestinal pores tempo-
rarily, without introducing toxic 
elements or causing permanent 
side effects. Pelargonidin, the 
compound in question, also gives 
strawberries their red color.
The research team worked 
in the lab to produce a pill that 
encapsulates insulin using 
pelargonidin, and proved its 
ef?cacy in mice. Although no side 
effects were discovered, the drug 
is far from being available for 
human diabetic patients to use to 
manage blood sugar.
“A number of challenges must 
still be addressed, one of the 
biggest being the necessity of 
variable dosage,” said Lamson in 
a press release. “Diabetics must 
test their blood sugar throughout 
the day and administer an insulin 
dose appropriate for their blood 
sugar levels. This is easy to do 
with an injection, but much more 
dif?cult to do with a pill.”
In the future, the team intends 
to use pelargonidin from straw-
berries in other protein therapy 
medicines, including those used 
to treat leukemia, osteoporosis 
and autoimmune disease.

Predicting the time and place of lightning superbolts
SEAN MIN
Staffwriter
University of Washington (UW) 
researchers recently published a 
study in the American Geophysi-
cal Union’s Journal of Geophysical 
Research: Atmospheres concerning 
mapping the time and place of 
so-called superbolts, lightning 
bolts which contain thousands of 
times more electrical energy than 
normal lightning bolts, according 
to a UW press release. Contained 
within these superbolts are one 
million Joules of electrical energy.
Superbolts and every other 
kind of lightning bolt are most 
active in a very low frequency 
range. With that said, previous 
research has demonstrated that 
superbolts typically strike the 
Earth in a completely different 
manner from normal lightning 
bolt — but researchers don’t 
understand why.
“It’s very unexpected and 
unusual where and when the 
very big strokes occur,” remarked 
Robert Holzworth in the UW 
press release, the lead author 
of the study and professor of 
Earth and Space Sciences at 
UW. He has been observing and 
tracking lightning for 20 years 
and manages the World Wide 
Lightning Location Network. This 
research consortium is managed 
by UW and is in charge of roughly 
100 lightning detection stations 
around the world, from northern 
Finland to Antarctica. Having so 
many stations around the world 
allows scientists to accurately 
and precisely observe the time 
when lightning reaches at least 
three stations and compare the 
readings from these stations to 
discover the size and location of a 
lightning bolt.
Though the World Wide 
Lightning Location Network 
began operation in the early 
2000s, this study only looked at 
2 billion lightning strokes which 
were observed between 2010 
and 2018. About 8,000 of these 
strokes (4 millionths of a percent 
or 1 in 250,000) were con?rmed 
to be superbolts. Holzworth says 
they only had gathered enough 
data in recent years to conduct a 
study.
The authors of the study 
looked at their own network’s 
data as well as that of Earth 
Networks, a Maryland-based 
company, and the New Zealand 
MetService. According to the 
paper, superbolts most commonly 
strike in the Mediterranean Sea, 
tropical oceans, lesser hotspots 
east of Japan, the Andes, and in 
the northeast Atlantic Ocean. 
While regular lightning bolts 
typically hit land, superbolts 
typically hit water.
“Ninety percent of lightning 
strikes occur over land. But 
superbolts happen mostly over 
the water going right up to the 
coast. In fact, in the northeast 
Atlantic Ocean you can see Spain 
and England’s coasts nicely out-
lined in the maps of superbolt 
distribution,” stated Holzworth. 
The average stroke energy over 
water is greater than the average 
stroke energy over land — such 
a dramatic difference was very 
unexpected.
The time of year superbolts 
strike is also different from 
that for regular lightning bolts. 
Regular lightning bolts typically 
strike over the summer, with 
“lightning chimneys” that match 
up with the times summer 
thunderstorms occur in the 
Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, 
and southeast Asia. Superbolts, in 
contrast, usually occur between 
November and February. They 
are also more common in the 
Northern Hemisphere although 
they do occur in the south as well. 
As of yet, more extensive patterns 
for superbolts are unknown. In 
some years, more superbolts 
occur for unexplained reasons. 
For example, occurrences of 
superbolts reached a peak in late 
2013. There were also many 
superbolts in late 2014, but there 
were far fewer superbolts in later 
years.
“We think it could be related 
to sunspots or cosmic rays,” said 
Holzworth, “but we’re leaving 
that as stimulation for future 
research. For now, we are showing 
that this previously unknown 
pattern exists.”

Superbolts contain thousands of times more energy than regular lightning, pictured above. This study shows that superbolts are usually observed over coastal water while over 90 percent of other lightning occurs over land.

Genetic association for left-handedness
ROSE EILENBERG
Staffwriter
About 90 percent of the human 
population is right-handed — this 
has been the case for the last 
10,000 years. But what sets lefties 
apart? A new study published in 
the journal Brain has identi?ed 
the speci?c genes that are related 
to which hand you prefer.
We’ve known for a while that 
genes play a role in determining 
handedness. Studies of twins 
have shown that 25 percent of 
the variation can be explained by 
genetic makeup. But this is the ?rst 
study to identify genome-wide 
signi?cant loci (?xed positions on 
a chromosome, or where a gene 
“lives”) for human handedness in 
the general population.
Data were collected from the 
UK Biobank, a repository of bio-
logical information from a large 
group of people. A big part of 
what allowed them to identify 
these loci was the size of the 
study: it included approximately 
400,000 people, 38,332 of whom 
were lefties. Dr. Akira Wiberg, a 
Medical Research Council fellow 
at the University of Oxford and the 
?rst author on the study, said in a 
press release, “Many researchers 
have studied the biological basis 
of handedness, but using large 
datasets from UK Biobank has 
allowed us to shed considerably 
more light on the processes 
leading to left-handedness.”
The researchers identi?ed 
four loci that were associated 
with handedness. Three of the 
four were also associated with 
encoding proteins involved 
in brain development and 
patterning. “Many animals show 
left-right asymmetry in their 
development, such as snail shells 
coiling to the left or right, and 
this is driven by genes for cell 
scaffolding, what we call the 
‘cytoskeleton,’” said Professor 
Gwenaëlle Douaud, associate 
professor at the University of 
Oxford and joint senior author on 
the study.
“For the ?rst time in humans, 
we have been able to establish 
that these handedness-associated 
cytoskeletal differences are 
actually visible in the brain. We 
know from other animals, such 
as snails and frogs, that these 
effects are caused by very early 
genetically-guided events, so this 
raises the tantalizing possibility 
that the hallmarks of the future 
development of handedness start 
appearing in the brain in the 
womb.”
The loci associated with left-
handedness are also strongly 
positively correlated with 
schizophrenia, while they are 
negatively correlated with 
Parkinson’s disease. Of course, 
correlation does not imply 
causation. Deepening knowledge 
of these genes could, however, 
help scientists understand these 
diseases.
“Throughout history, left-
handedness has been considered 
unlucky, or even malicious. 
Indeed, this is re?ected in 
the words for left and right in 
many languages. For example, 
in English ‘right’ also means 
correct or proper; in French 
‘gauche’ means both left and 
clumsy,” said Professor Dominic 
Furniss, associate professor at the

Vehicle safety add-on features can prevent 1.6 billion crashes
TRENTO VON LINDENBERG
Staffwriter
Add-ons are a common concept 
nowadays. From cable packages, to 
insurance on Amazon purchases, 
to downloadable content in video 
games — it seems like everything 
comes in a basic, stripped down 
form, with the rest sold as extras. 
But what about those cases when 
the “extras” are just as or more 
valuable than the base they’re 
added to?
Take a car, for example. If you 
wanted to add a sound system, 
media center, or heated seats, your 
bill could quickly go up by several 
hundred dollars (depending on 
the manufacturer and dealer). Of 
course, these are luxury items, 
after all, so it makes sense that 
you’d have to pay a bit more for 
some added comfort.
But not all add-ons are created 
equal, and some are less about 
personal luxuries and more 
about safety. Car manufacturers 
are now equipping vehicles with 
driver-assist warning systems like 
camera arrays and radar, which 
enable blind-spot monitoring, 
collision warning systems, and 
even automated parallel parking.
So while self-driving vehicles 
might be just over the horizon, 
we have the potential to make our 
existing vehicles safer with the tech 
we have now. As Corey Harper, a 
postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie 
Mellon’s civil and environmental 
engineering department said, 
“We don’t have to wait for a future 
with self-driving cars to realize a 
lot of the bene?ts of sensing and 
automation.”
Harper and his colleagues 
recently published a study into a 
few of the driver-assist technolo-
gies available. The researchers 
came to the conclusion that these 
safety systems, if made standard 
on all US vehicles, could prevent 
“1.6 million crashes” per year. 
All totaled, the reduction could 
potentially create a “net bene?t of 
more than $20 billion annually” 
for an average cost of $600 per car.
With any luck, the publication 
of their study might bring 
attention to the bene?ts of these 
features, especially for prospective 
car owners weighing their options. 
Not only do these safety features 
“provide distributed bene?ts… 
[such as] less congestion, fewer 
taxpayer-supported emergency 
responses,” but they also help 
prevent personal injuries, 
damages, and deaths.
Popularizing these added 
safety features can help reduce 
the frequency and costs of 
accidents on both a personal and 
public level. And with time, they 
may even become a part of the 
standard new-vehicle package at 
no extra cost.
LEFTIES, from A7
University of Oxford, and also 
joint senior author on the study.
But being left-handed could 
have some bene?ts. One striking 
result is that there is an increase in 
functional connectivity between 
right and left language networks 
in lefties. Detailed brain imaging 
of approximately 9,000 partici-
pants showed differences in white 
matter tracts, which contain the 
cytoskeleton of the brain that joins 
the language-related regions.
“We discovered that, in left-
handed participants, the language 
areas of the left and right sides 
of the brain communicate with 
each other in a more coordinated 
way. This raises the intriguing 
possibility for future research 
that left-handers might have 
an advantage when it comes 
to performing verbal tasks,” 
Dr. Wiberg said, but he warns 
that these results do not apply 
neatly to every individual. “It 
must be remembered that these 
differences were only seen as 
averages over very large numbers 
of people and not all left-handers 
will be similar.”
The study does not de?nitively 
conclude whether increased 
coordination of language function 
gives left-handers a cognitive 
advantage at verbal tasks, the 
authors leaving this question to 
future investigations.
How left-handedness affects brain function
About 90 percent of the human 
population is right-handed.

The 2019 World Para 
Swimming Championships kicked 
off last Monday in London, and 
spectators didn’t have to wait 
long for excitement and drama to 
set in.
The women’s 400m free-
style S6 ?nal (a classi?cation of 
disability for the athletes) was 
the second medaling event of the 
championship, and witnessed 
a newcomer, 14-year-old Jiang 
Yuyan of China, facing off 
against Paralympic champion and 
world record holder Yelyzaveta 
Mereshko of Ukraine.
Jiang came into the 
competition with a time of 
5:31.44, and had put up a time of 
5:24.92 in her heat that morning, 
?nishing nearly one and a half 
seconds behind Mereshko, but 
qualifying for ?nals in second 
place. Because eight out of 
the nine swimmers in the heat 
would move on to the ?nals, the 
pace wasn’t exactly cutthroat, 
and neither woman was close 
to Mereshko’s world record of 
5:14.69.
The ?nals of the women’s 
400m freestyle S6 began with 
Mereshko having the best start 
off the blocks (Jiang taking more 
than a half second longer). Using 
the momentum from her start, 
along with a high stroke rate, 
Mereshko turned at the ?rst wall 
nearly two whole seconds ahead 
of the entire ?eld — a lead which 
only increased in the subsequent 
lap.
At the 200m mark, Mereshko 
had shaken off virtually everyone, 
and was several body lengths 
ahead of all of her competitors, 
save Jiang. The split showed that 
Jiang had not only been chasing 
Mereshko’s punishing pace, but 
had gained on her. Though she 
lost some ground to Mereshko 
during the following length, it 
was Jiang who pushed off the 
wall ?rst heading into the last lap, 
0.2 seconds ahead of the pre-race 
favorite.
The last lap saw both women 
?ghting for gold, with Mereshko 
pushing as hard as she could, but 
Jiang maintaining her slim lead. 
Mustering up all the strength 
she had left, Jiang surged ahead 
even further in the last 25 
meters, ?nishing with a time of 
5:13.32, over 4 seconds in front 
of Mereshko, and setting a new 
world record.
Jiang then went on to win the 
women’s 100m freestyle S6 ?nal 
(just ahead of Mereshko again) 
and set a new championship 
record. She also took bronze in 
both the 100m backstroke S6 and 
50m freestyle, setting a new Asian 
record in the latter. In her ?nal 
event, the women’s 50m butter?y, 
she once again took ?rst place, 
breaking another world record in 
the process.
Life wasn’t always this like this 
for Jiang. When she was only four 
years old, she was run over by a 
truck. The sheer size and weight 
of the vehicle crushed the bones 
of the limbs trapped under it, 
and after being rushed to the 
hospital, doctors amputated her 
right leg and arm. Even after the 
procedure, bone overgrowth in 
the residual limbs necessitated 
many more visits to the hospital. 
Attempting to aid her recovery 
and future growth, doctors 
suggested Jiang try swimming. 
Her mother enrolled her in a swim 
program during summer break in 
2012, and she’s been in the water 
ever since.
The journey to a world record 
was not an easy endeavor. In a 
translated interview with local 
media First Hand Investigation 
(later published by The Daily 
Mail), Jiang’s mother recalls 
that some of the other kids cried, 
calling her daughter “half-a-
person,” and told her not to return 
to the pool. Nevertheless, Jiang 
persevered, saying that “some 
kids would cry because they 
choked on water and would not 
want to keep swimming. I wasn’t 
like that. I just picked myself up 
and kept going.”
In 2015, she became the 
national champion in the 50m 
butter?y. Two years later, she 
placed ?rst in six separate events 
domestically and won the 100m 
freestyle at the 2017 Asian Youth 
Para Games in Dubai. Now, Jiang 
is not only a world champion 
three times over, but a holder of 
two world records as well. “In the 
water, I don’t need prosthetics, I 
don’t need a crutch,” she states. 
“I can rely on my own strength to 
determine my direction and goal.” 
Jiang is a swimmer to watch in the 
future, but her immediate success 
is amazing.

Former Steeler Antonio Brown accused of sexual assault
IZZY SIO
Contributing Editor
You’d think that after a 
summer of cryotherapy, frostbite, 
helmets, trades, fines, fights, 
near fights, conspiracies, and ar-
guably the most boring costume 
on FOX’s The Masked Singer 
(he was the hippo), Antonio 
Brown’s summer saga would be 
over once the former Pittsburgh 
Steeler finally got what he want-
ed – a spot on the New England 
Patriots, current Super Bowl 
champions. But Tuesday’s New 
York Times report accusing Brown 
of sexual assault has highlighted 
the most damning problems with 
the National Football League 
(NFL), especially with regard to 
the #MeToo movement within 
sports.
As we learned in the report, 
Britney Taylor, Brown’s former 
physical trainer, filed a civil law-
suit in a Florida court accusing 
the star wide receiver of three 
separate incidents of sexual 
assault – two in June 2017 in 
Florida, and one in May 2018 in 
Pittsburgh. Claims made in a civil 
lawsuit are made with no formal 
police investigation.
If the claims are true, Brown 
wouldn’t face charges or jail 
time. He would have to pay com-
pensation to Taylor for the harm 
caused. In a statement released 
on Twitter, Brown’s legal team 
claims that Taylor approached 
Brown in 2017 to invest $1.6 mil-
lion in one of Taylor’s business 
projects, which apparently was 
a cover to pay off a $30,000 
IRS tax lien and use $300,000 
“to purchase property already 
owned by the accuser and her 
mother.” The statement also 
claims that in 2018, Brown and 
Taylor reportedly engaged in a 
consensual personal relationship 
while Taylor was helping to train 
Brown for the upcoming football 
season.
But just as quickly as news of 
the lawsuit broke out, the NFL 
has dealt with the case in typical 
fashion. For now, Antonio Brown 
will play for the Patriots while 
the NFL conducts their own 
investigation, planning to work 
with Taylor in the case and inter-
view Brown next week, according 
to the New York Post.
While the NFL was reportedly 
considering placing Brown on 
the NFL Commissioner’s Exempt 
List, their eventual decision to 
let Brown continue to play is 
frustrating, disappointing, but 
not surprising. For what feels 
like years, the NFL has received 
nonstop criticism for how it 
handles its players’ cases of 
domestic violence and sexual 
abuse. While the organization 
has set policies and made efforts 
to improve this, such as a six-
game unpaid ban for domestic 
violence cases against partners 
and the NFL Players Association 
Commission on Violence 
Prevention, it feels as if the 
NFL treats cases more as public 
relations problems against their 
players and their organizations 
rather than recognizing their 
influence on the world at large.
The NFL Commissioner’s 
Exempt List doesn’t seem to be a 
punishment. According to the NFL 
Player Personnel Policy Manual, 
“The Exempt List is a special 
player status available to clubs 
only in unusual circumstances. 
The List includes those players 
who have been declared by the 
Commissioner to be temporarily 
exempt from counting within the 
Active List limit.”
To interpret this policy from 
its jargon, Brown would not be 
able to play games or practice for 
games, but he would still be able 
to receive treatment at training 
facilities and essentially be put 
on paid leave for the time being. 
He also would not count towards 
his team’s standard 53-man ros-
ter. Most recent players to be 
placed on this list include Adrian 
Peterson and Greg Hardy in 2014, 
both in separate child abuse and 
domestic violence cases, and 
Kareem Hunt in 2018 before his 
eventual suspension last fall for 
beating a woman in a hotel.
With regard to cases of 
personal misconduct such as sex-
ual abuse and domestic violence, 
it feels as if the NFL acts outside 
of the standard moral practices 
of business. Combined with an 
inept criminal justice system 
when it comes to prosecuting 
sexual assault and harassment, 
especially in high profile 
cases, NFL players and other 
athletes often escape with little 
punishment.
This kind of treatment is so 
contrary to what we’ve seen in 
the past year and a half with 
#MeToo’s influence in the 
entertainment industry. Stars 
like Kevin Spacey, Max Landis, 
Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer, and 
Harvey Weinstein swiftly fell out 
of the spotlight and into pub-
lic disgrace. But in the largely 
male-dominated world of sports, 
the #MeToo movement is 
incredibly behind. Just this year, 
wide receiver Tyreek Hill was 
investigated for child abuse, yet 
was still offered a three-year, $54 
million contract extension with 
the Kansas City Chiefs. Hill was 
also accused of domestic assault 
in 2014, eventually pleading 
guilty and serving three years of 
probation.
Across the sports industry, men 
are almost exclusively in charge. 
There are few women in the front 
offices of teams, and even fewer 
in the offices of the leagues, 
which stands in stark contrast 
to some of the progress made 
by the world of entertainment. 
In the entertainment industry, 
Hollywood is attempting to make 
a more conscious effort and 
awareness to give a larger rep-
resentative voice to women and 
other diverse perspectives.
Meanwhile, all four 
professional sports leagues are 
led by male commissioners; Rog-
er Goodell, called “the most pow-
erful man in sports” by Bloomberg 
Businessweek, has worked as the 
NFL commissioner for 12 years. 
National Hockey League (NHL) 
commissioner Gary Bettman has 
held the position since 1993. 
No matter how many initiatives 
and committees the NFL or any 
other sports leagues build to 
combat personal misconduct 
and domestic abuse, their poor 
handling of these issues over the 
years makes it hard to have faith 
in these initiatives.
There needs to be a 
fundamental change in the 
industry for #MeToo to have any 
chance to possibly break into 
sports. In an article in New York 
Magazine, Will Leitch claims that 
“When the only goal is winning, 
it’s quite easy to rationalize your 
morality into ‘second chances’ 
and ‘redemption stories.’ If he 
plays for another team, he’s a 
monster. If he plays for yours, he 
has ‘overcome off-field adversity.’ 
If you produce, your crimes will 
not be forgiven, but pushed under 
the table. Sports will not change 
until they are required to.”
The #MeToo movement has al-
ready struggled with the line be-
tween these redemption stories, 
providing these second chances, 
and tackling some larger, complex

ment to overcome these issues

Carnegie Mellon University’s 
men’s soccer team scored at 
opposite ends of the match to 
cruise to a 2–0 victory over 
Westminster College on Friday 
night.
The Tartans scored in the 
15th and 77th minutes on goals 
by juniors Nick Isham and 
Patrick Kollman, respectively. 
This put their season marks at 
two and three goals each, as the 
Tartans improved to 3–2 overall.
Opportunities came early 
and often for the Tartans, as 
they mustered a total of 13 
shots on goal compared to 
Westminster’s two. The shots 
led to a goal shortly into the first 
half, as the Westminster goal-
keeper lost control of a spin-
ning shot that became Isham’s 
second goal of the season. 
The Tartan offense continued 
pressing Westminster’s defense 
in the second half and came 
away with another goal on a 
low, hard shot into the corner by 
Kollman assisted by junior Reed 
Peterson.
On the other side of the 
field, Westminster struggled to 
maintain an offense. Despite 
a charge at the end of the first 
half, the Tartans blocked shots 
and had a timely diving save 
by their keeper, Alex Singh, to 
maintain a shutout.
“We talked all week about 
[how] the small things mat-
ter,” said Carnegie Mellon head 
coach Brandon Bowman of his 
team’s performance, “They 
build up to the big things, and I 
think you saw that tonight.”
The men’s soccer team is 
now entering a crucial stretch 
of games against Allegheny 
College, local rival Grove City 
College, and John Carroll 
University. At just above .500, 
Bowman hopes his team will 
build on their play in Friday’s 
win. “We try to focus on how 
we’re playing, and hopefully, 
the results come with that,” he 
said.
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team plays next at 
Allegheny College on Monday, 
Sept. 16.

You can feel the anticipation building as the 
audience waits anxiously for the start of the 
show. People have brought in their snacks 
and drinks and are quietly munching on 
them while flipping through the programs. 
They are reading all about the fabulous cast 
of The Lion King, the performance they will 
soon experience at the Benedum Center in 
downtown Pittsburgh.
The lights begin to dim. People silence their 
cell phones and a voice erupts over the 
speaker, announcing where the nearest 
exits are and to enjoy the show. The lights 
fade to a black out.
“Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba…”
The first line of the show bursts 
out of the dark as the lights 
come up revealing a beautiful 
set of oranges, reds, and 
yellows. A gigantic, ribbed fabric 
sun rises from the ground and covers the 
entirety of the backdrop on the stage.
Pride Rock slowly moves its way on stage 
and stands proudly in the middle. It soon 
is decorated with many people costumed 
as animals. The intricate masks and 
beadwork stand out in each individual 
costume design, as well as the beautiful 
makeup design on each performer, created 
with bright colors on some and neutral on 
others.
One of the most incredible things to witness 
are the puppeteers hard at work. The 
show actually has over 232 puppets used 
throughout the production. Their puppets 
have difficult and unique mechanics 
that take time to master, so watching 
their intricate movements is particularly 
intriguing. One of the most beloved 
characters, Zazu, falls under the puppet 
category. The actor, being one of the main 
sources of comic relief in the show, is tasked 
with the creation of expression through a 
puppet and body movements, rather than 
his own expressions, which can pose a 
challenge. Luckily for the audience, these 
actors are some of the most talented and 
expressive.
In total, it took around 37,000 hours 
to build these masks and puppets to 
perfection. This is clear from how beautiful 
the show is when put all together. The 
show is the third longest running Broadway 
performance, which is not surprising at all. 
This spectacular show has been dazzling 
and warming the hearts of many for years, 
and will continue for many years to come.
If you haven’t had the chance to experience 
it, PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh is presenting 
The Lion King musical, performed at the 
Benedum Center downtown. Check out this 
once in a lifetime experience. I guarantee 
you’re in for a treat!

It feels wrong to walk through the floors of the Miller Institute for 
Contemporary Art’s exhibition “An Atlas of Commoning: Spaces 
of Collective Production” while the exhibit is deserted. The pieces 
featured not only depict different aspects of the modern communal 
experience, but beg to be experienced as a group. I was too nervous 
to take off my shoes and stand on the large rug by myself, unable 
to read all of the pamphlets dissecting different communal projects 
alone, and felt weird sitting next to empty seats to watch the videos. 
Perhaps the experience of going alone heightened my awareness 
of the ways in which shared experiences can shape experiences. 
So, whether by yourself or in a group, be sure to stop by the Miller 
Institute for Contemporary Art before “An Atlas of Commoning”, 
produced in collaboration with ica and ARCH+, closes on Sept. 23.

Sex and the City, an iconic and timeless 
property, has seen its fair share of screen 
time. From its six seasons airing on HBO 
to its time on the big screen in Sex and 
the City (2008) and sequel Sex and the 
City 2 (2010), the charming yet dramatic 
tales of Carrie Bradshaw are told from 
the first person of her sex column. It is 
no wonder that the Sex and the City 
adventures have held wide popularity 
throughout their existence, but for 
nostalgia’s sake, I’d like to explain just 
how novel and hitched into relevance its 
entire legacy truly is.
Aiming to reach an audience of 
anyone interested in fantasizing about 
a promiscuous life in the Big Apple, 
Bradshaw writes tales of encounters — 
both sexual and romantic — and weaves 
in her own hint of comedy to give levity 
to relationships commonly given too much 
gravity in our mundane lives. An example 
of this would be after the divorce between 
Charlotte York and her ex-husband Trey 
MacDougal. While pining over her lost 
“one big love” she meets her “putz” of a 
divorce lawyer. Bald, loud, ill-mannered, 
Harry constantly flaunts his affection 
written by Zofia Majewski | Junior Staffwriter
layout by Sahaana Sethu | Junior Layout Designer
toward Charlotte. In no time, Charlotte 
falls in love with Harry and even converts 
to Judaism for him. The unexpectedness 
of such a relationship displays just how 
complex and clever creator Darren Shaw 
truly made the Sex and the City empire.
With the proper Charlotte, practical 
Miranda, promiscuous Samantha, 
and playful Carrie, Sex and the City 
encompasses all parts of a woman one 
might aspire to be. Throughout the show 
and movies, each woman holds their 
own experiences good and bad, explicit 
and heartfelt, allowing the viewer to 
connect with them on surface and deeper 
levels. For such reasons, the Sex and 
the City empire gives each viewer the 
opportunity to live vicariously through 
each character. I doubt that this gem 
of a show (and successive movies) will 
ever lose relevance in society as it holds 
such a unique balance of comedy and 
sexuality for anyone to enjoy. As I grow 
as an individual, I will always cherish 
Bradshaw’s (and Shaw’s) honesty and 
unique approach to life as it tells us that 
love is not dead and one shouldn’t be 
afraid to have fun while searching for it.

W
hile many have named Jon 
Chu’s adaptation of Kevin 
Kwan’s book Crazy Rich 
Asians the pioneer full-cast Asian-American 
movie marking a historical change in ethnic 
representation, Hollywood’s first full-cast 
Asian-American movie was actually made 
more than two decades ago. The Joy 
Luck Club, directed by Amy Tan in 1993, 
held the position of first Asian-American 
movie for 25 years. Following the movie’s 
release, viewers had high hopes for Asian 
representation in Hollywood. The Joy 
Luck Club was held as an exception to 
Hollywood’s typical cast and remained 
alone in its category until the last two 
years.
Last year, there was more Asian-American 
representation in films than ever before, 
starting in June with Pixar’s 8-minute 
feature film Bao, which played in theaters 
before Incredibles 2 and portrayed cultural 
differences between a Chinese immigrant 
mother and her first-generation son. In 
Aug., three movies with Asian-American 
leads were released: the novel adaptation 
Crazy Rich Asians starring a full-Asian 
cast, Netflix original To All the Boys I’ve 
written by Nancy Zuo | Junior Staffwriter

Loved Before starring Lana 
Candor, and Searching 
starring John Cho. As a 
result, the hashtag 
“#AsianAugust” 
began to gain 
popularity on the 
internet. This May, 
Netflix released 
the original 
Always Be My 
Maybe starring 
Randall Park 
and Ali Wong, 
and A24 limited-released The 
Farewell starring Awkwafina.
Several factors influenced the 25-year 
gap between the release of The Joy Luck 
Club and Crazy Rich Asians. Following 
the release of The Joy Luck Club, director 
Wayne Wang faced difficulties pitching 
Asian-American film ideas to studios and 
casting Asian actors in other movies. 
Though Wang’s efforts for The Joy Luck 
Club led to lead actor Ming-Na Wen later 
landing the lead role in Disney’s animated 
film Mulan, it was still difficult for Asian-
American actors to land roles that were not

specifically written as an Asian role.
“I work in an industry that really has 
no regard for my voice and the voice of 
people like me and so, what do I do? Keep 
knocking on that door or build your own 
house?” Constance Wu tweeted, quoting 
Ava DuVernay two weeks prior to the 
release of Crazy Rich Asians, which she 
starred in. 
During the casting of Crazy Rich Asians, 
director Jon Chu faced challenges in the 
proper portrayal of identity: whether or not 
a Malaysian can play a Singaporean, an 
Asian an Asian-American, or if a parent has 
to be of the same ethnic background as the 
child. In addition, with a limited number of 
Asian-American actors to pull from, Chu’s 
casting soon turned international, and he 
had to be careful of casting actors with 
different English accents.
While Asian-Americans slowly turned the 
tide in Hollywood, they were also beginning 
to become more represented in media last 
year. In the 2018 Winter Olympics, Chloe 
Kim became the youngest woman to win the 
Olympic snowboarding metal, Mirai Nagasu 
became the first woman to land triple axels 
in figure skating, and the Shibutani siblings 
became the first sibling ice dancers to earn 
a medal in the Olympics.
Starting in Sept. of last year, the popular 
Facebook group “Subtle Asian Traits”, 
founded by a group of high-school seniors 
from the Melbourne area in Australia, 
went viral. The group references cultural 
pressures that many immigrant children 
face, and started with a group of students 
sharing jokes about their bitter obligation 
to attend Mandarin classes every weekend 
while their friends got to sleep in. “Subtle 
Asian Traits” now holds 1.4 million 
members and has countless sub-groups 
such as “Subtle Asian Dating” and “Subtle 
Curry Traits.”
While it is uncertain that the plethora of 
Asian-American led films will continue or 
be added to the slow but ever-growing 
collection, Wu believes this is just the 
beginning. “My dear Asian-American 
friends, we are building our own damn 
houses. We got the tools, the ability and we 
definitely got the style. Just because others 
don’t see it, doesn’t mean we don’t have it. 
We do. I’ve seen it,” tweeted Wu in 2018.

After 13 years, Tool came back with a monster of an album, Fear Inoculum. With ten songs clocking in at a length of an hour and 26 minutes, 
it’s certainly their longest album. It dethroned Taylor Swift from the charts once it came out, quite possibly the most glorious feeling I’ve felt in 
the past few weeks. A mainstream album by a famous metal band that is actually topping the charts is a rare occasion, but it shows how big 
the following for the genre is and how dedicated the fans are.
I was thrilled for the album. Tool has inspired a lot of my songwriting. Lateralus is one of my personal favorite albums, and I was hoping the 
album would be something along those lines. But on my first listen, I ended up feeling a thing I thought I wouldn’t feel.
Disappointed.
Each song on Lateralus had riffs and moments that would hit you and stick with you for the rest of the day. You hear the initial bass line of 
songs like “Schism” and it’s immediately memorable. I didn’t feel that same way about Fear Inoculum. Despite having songs that would be 
upwards of 16 minutes, I felt like I couldn’t pick out many memorable moments throughout the album. In fact, many of the songs could have 
been cut down by three to five minutes, and it wouldn’t have made a difference. “7empest”, “Descending”, and “Invincible” have a few of 
the memorable riffs, but overall, the first experience just felt fine.
What was that, Tool? You make an album after 13 years, and that’s what you give us? Of course, my expectation of what I wanted was 
subverted, and I wasn’t the only Tool fan who felt this way. Quite a large section of the fanbase felt a little bit of disappointment. The album 
wasn’t exactly what we wanted. Despite that, something drew me to the album regardless. The composition was all solid, and there was a lot 
to like in it regardless of how disappointed I felt on the initial listen. Tool does take some time to sit down and click with, which is a quintes-
sential facet of progressive rock and metal. So I did that. I sat down for a second listen, this time taking away my expectations, and mentally 
preparing myself for the journey. I felt a different feeling this time.
Satisfaction.
10

---------------------------------------------------

Okay, Tool. I get what you’re going for. The point of it wasn’t to retread the past. There are moments that recall the past and made me ecstatic, but the sound 
is different. Tool has evolved, and they aren’t afraid to keep pushing the boundaries of what they can make. The songs feel less long this time around, and 
things seem to flow more clearly. It hasn’t fully clicked yet, and I don’t know whether the next listen will make me love it more or love it less. So I decided to 
give it one more go, and my feelings changed again.
Elation.
It took three listens, but I eventually loved the new Tool album. It’s a lot to take in at once. The album is so dense and has a lot to unpack. For a mainstream 
album, it is comparatively inaccessible compared to their previous works and other mainstream metal and rock albums. The choices were truly daring. Each 
part of the composition, from the little transitions to the larger scale instrumental jams, felt like it had a purpose and deliberate weight to it all, even if it felt 
overly long at times.
The concept of the album is also interesting. A big theme in Tool’s music is maturity, both in the lyrics and in the composition. While the music on this album 
is lengthy, it never feels particularly self-indulgent. The odd time signatures and polymeters all serve a purpose to the overall concept and theme of the story. 
The band is growing and maturing over the years, and this album is more proof of that. Even if there isn’t something that sticks out the same way riffs do on 
Lateralus, listening to this album feels like an experience. There isn’t a single song you can listen to without being in the mindset to sit down and truly listen to 
the music. It demands attention and demands you to listen to it rather than rock to it, although there are certainly many moments throughout this album where 
you can do both.
Tool’s return feels like an old friend coming back. Granted, I am not old enough to really grow up with Tool, but they were a defining experience in high 
school and were my gateway into progressive metal. Fear Inoculum is a massive piece of music, and it’s a lot more rare to see something like that become 
super popular now. I will be listening to this album several more times, searching for new meaning in it, and paying attention to the musicality and picking up 
on new things.
Welcome back, Tool.

Silence is what I first felt meeting you.
I couldn’t help but notice how your scattered long black hair looked perfect compared to my uncombed
black hair oiling down to my scalp
Just as fast as my entire body rose in shock
As the introvert’s chaotic mind
Went completely
Silent.
With a person with ADHD you rarely have these quiet moments, you see.
I think in weird tangents all across
Images constantly refresh in my head remembering every face and conversation I’ve ever had
But suddenly it was like an infinite loop in my system
Of your smile slightly covered with your straight hair
I love counting
I would “like” hate anyone who said “like” the word “like” too often:
you said it 36 times.
I love painting
The thick paint dripping like a molten river from the brush turning
to blades of grass with dew on them:
you remind me of that.
I love static electricity
I could rip apart wires and build circuits but in the end as I sit writing this poem in the dark:
I hope my goosebumps settle down in the same silence of my mind.
I love counting
While counting the time signature of my favourite song
I’ve opened the door for you one time
I couldn’t help but notice how you walked in sync with the song.
I love painting
And the conglomerated tar requires the endless forces of the brush to ruffle
Backwards and forward
But all I can think of are scattered numbers
Freud calls dreams a wish fulfilment…
Does it mean you’ll only stay in my dreams?
I love static electricity
Like the attraction of particles to be cemented together, bound for life
When Feynman said the neutrino floats and drifts alone in the universe
I felt that feeling that

---------------------------------------------------

I didn’t need you
That I was experiencing so much of the universe on my own
Boundless.
I love counting
When I counted how many times I thought my new professors moved a yawn in the people sitting around 
me
I imagined where you were turning my head ever so slightly:
Your eyes were closed,
From my boundaries,
Or perhaps I fell asleep before actually turning around.
I love painting
The textures of your callous wrists as they move over the violin
Like the poetry of the mumbling of your fast tones
My brush would break into a thousand wood splinters before I could touch your curvature
And I’m okay with that.
I love static electricity…
I love counting
I love painting
I don’t ramble anymore
I can remember things now
I can breathe slowly now
I don’t panic lying in my bed thinking of whether I’ll get to talk to someone the next day
I love counting,
In how many ways you changed me
I love painting,
A thank you letter to leave by your door
I love static electricity
That I feel from loving myself today
Silence is dangerous, my parents said to me.
My whole life I’ve been told I’m too shy
I used to tell them “my mind is running free”
But now that I look at you
Peace is all I feel.
Silence
That was long awaited by me.

The Lumineers
I
The Lumineers transgress music industry tradition with their newest album, III. Rather than 
take the typical route, they told a story in three parts, releasing three songs at a time in 
their EPs, Gloria and II, before finishing the narrative with four new songs, which got
compiled into the complete 10-song album. In addition to this unique and emotional three-
chapter album, the Lumineers document the tumultuous generations of the fictional Sparks 
family through short films that coincide with each song.
In an interview with the Huffington Post, The Lumineers’ percussionist Jeremiah Fraites 
explained that III “thematically deals with not just addiction and alcoholism, but how you 
continue to love a person in the wake of the trauma they cause.”
Lumineers bandmates Fraites and Wesley Schultz have first-hand experience with a loved 
one suffering from addiction, and listening to III, you can instantly tell that they poured 
their souls into their music.
The first chapter is about Gloria Sparks. The first song, “Donna,” gives off a nostalgic, but 
melancholy vibe, juxtaposing Gloria Sparks’ current life with her husband and baby to her 
childhood growing up with her mother Donna.
The second verse of the song is the most potent and sets the tone for the rest of the album: 
“If you don’t have it, then you’ll never give it / And I don’t blame you for the way you 
livin’ / The little boy was born in February / You couldn’t sober up to hold a baby.” It 
establishes how Gloria’s lack of love from her mother growing up influences her own role 
as a mother, and how her addiction is rooted deeper than just the individual level.
The video opens with Gloria with her husband and baby posing for portraits, but
having trouble getting everyone to focus at the same time. Rather than being a humorous 
moment, however, you can see the exhaustion in the parents’ faces. Next, it zooms into 
their home, revealing Gloria catching herself from a fall between the piano and the baby’s 
crib, with the baby watching from the corner innocently. While Gloria climbs into bed, it 
reveals her tear-soaked face staring at a portrait of her parents on the bedside table, then 
cuts to flashbacks of her parents, baby Gloria crying, gravestones of her parents, and then 
fast-forwards to her own baby sitting on the floor confusedly looking into the camera.
In “Life in the City,” the Lumineers give a very brief sense of hope of traveling to a new 
city, but the “dream, it died” and there is a realization that “living life in the city […] will 
never be pretty.” The video follows Gloria as she goes to a bar, does a line in the bath-
room, then hooks up with someone she meets at the counter, before returning home to her 
sleeping family and putting her wedding ring back on.
The close of the first chapter, “Gloria,” left me in tears, diving deep into the addiction, 
with evocative imagery in the lyrics and the film. The song is a plea for Gloria to slow 
down, pointing out “I smell it on your breath […] booze and peppermint,” and asking, 
“Gloria, did you finally see that enough is enough?” The tempo also fits with the urgency 
of the lyrics and the scenes, from her husband coming home to her on the floor, her mouth 
foaming and her body twitching, the baby in the background crying, to Gloria sneaking 
drinks behind the house and fighting with her husband.

III
The second chapter chronicles Junior Sparks’ teenage years as he struggles at home with his father Jimmy and his 
absent mother Bonnie. “It Wasn’t Easy to Be Happy for You” starts with the heartbreak of a girlfriend leaving him, 
and “Leader of the Landslide” picks up with him recognizing the toxic nature of his family, with his alcoholic father 
being the titular “leader of the landslide.”
The video emotionally showcases Junior’s relationship with his father, as he continuously drinks and throws parties, 
beating Junior and pulling a gun when he rejects his father’s offerings of alcohol. By the end, Junior runs out while 
the rest of the party disperses or lies on the floor laughing deliriously. Similar to “Gloria,” the tempo and video 
perfectly match in intensity. Last of the chapter is “Left For Denver,” capturing the pain of Junior’s mother leaving 
him behind.
The last chapter explores Jimmy Sparks, the father of Junior and son of Gloria. The videos for the last four songs 
have yet to be released on YouTube, although the complete film appeared at the Toronto International Film 
Festival on Sept. 8.
These four songs are rather despondent additions to the album, but Schultz’ haunting vocals really make the song 
stand out from the rest. “Jimmy Sparks” specifically dives into the details of Jimmy’s difficulties in his relationship 
with Bonnie and trying to save his sick son by making quick money at the casino, and it only spirals from there. 
“April” is a short instrumental, but the music is no less heart-wrenching than the rest of the Jimmy Sparks chapter. 
The conclusion to the album, “Salt and the Sea,” was actually the song that started it all, with darker undertones 
than a lot of their previous music that helped them shape the stories of Gloria, Junior, and Jimmy Sparks.
Although I enjoyed the Lumineers’ previous two albums, I actually did not follow III as it was released chapter 
by chapter throughout the year and had no idea what to expect. However, the album completely surpassed any 
expectations I could have possibly had. Although definitely heavier than some of their other work, III is a well-
crafted narrative and a candid exploration of addiction that should not be missed.
