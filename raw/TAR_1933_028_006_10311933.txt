Comparison With Other Restaurants 
Proves Commons Has Lower Rates
In response to many complaints in opposition to the prices charged 
the students for food at the Commons, the Tartan has for three weeks 
been conducting an investigation of tho Commons in comparison with 
four Oakland restaurants (a, b, c, and d) chosen arbitrarily on the 
basis of price, quality of food, and popularity with the students.
The foods for comparison were divided into six classifications: 
sandwiches, soups, beverages and drinks, egg and omelette combina­
tions, salad and meat combinations.
Of the 27 varieties of sandwiches served by the Commons, 11 of 
them are sold cheaper at the Commons than at a, b, c, or d. One sand­
wich was sold cheaper by one of the Oakland restaurants and the re­
maining group are either the same price or cheaper than one or two of 
the Oakland restaurants.
Three of the nine varieties of soups sold at the Commons are sold 
cheaper there than at either a, b, c, or d. One variety is not sold by
a, b, c, or d and the other five soups are the same price or cheaper than 
one or two of the Oakland restaurants.
Eleven different beverages and drinks may be bought at the Com­
mons. In seven cases the Commons price is cheaper than the Oakland 
price and the other four prices are either equal to or cheaper than the 
Oakland restaurants.
The prices of the twelve combinations of eggs and omelettes at the 
Commons are in every case lower than the corresponding prices at a,
b, c, or d. This difference varies from 5c to 30c.
A, b, c, and d charge a higher price for nine of the eleven salads 
sold at the Commons. The other two salad prices ai‘e equal to or 
cheaper than the Oakland restaurants.
Everyone but one of the seven meat combinations served at the 
Commons is cheaper than the corresponding price at the Oakland res­
taurants. The exception was equaled in price by only one of the four 
restaurants.
This comparison is a compliment to the Commons for in the ma­
jority the Commons prices are cheaper for individual orders, and with 
one exception are not higher than Oakland restaurant prices. All cook­
ing, including the baking of pies and cakes, is done in the Commons 
kitchen.
The special luncheons and dinners served at the Commons are ex­
ceeded by the Oakland restaurants in choice of food and variety of

Cheerleaders 
Hold Annual 
Dance Friday
Town Tattlers Furnish 
Music; Dance Takes 
Place of Rally
The Carnegie cheerleaders will 
hold their annual dance this Fri­
day evening in Thistle Hall. The

Grove City College Spring Formal 
and at several of the Penn State 
house parties. During the sum­
mer they were engaged at Slippery 
Rock Park, which also featured 
Emerson Gill and his orchestra, 
and the Shannopin Country Club.
Although final plans have not 
been made, the dance will be in 
the form of a pep rally for the 
Purdue game. Special arrange­
ments are being made for decora­
tions and some interesting novelty 
will be introduced as at previous 
football dances.
Tickets may be secured at the 
door for the usual price of $1 per

“One of Most Important 
Works Ever Undertaken,” 
Says Prof. Gustafson
The Graphic Arts Index lor 1932- 
33, a reference guide for the pub­
lications and periodicals of the 
printing world, is now being pro­
duced by the Department of Print­
ing. Professor David Gustafson, 
head of the Department looks 
upon this publication as one of the 
most important pieces of produo 
tion work ever undertaken by his 
department.
The 104-page index will be the 
first publication containing factual 
material on the printing industry 
to be published in the . United 
States. This “printers’ bible” was 
compiled by the Department of 
Education of ' the United Ty- 
pothetae of America under the di­
rection of Fred J. Hartman, a 
former member of the faculty and 
assistant to the president of Car­
negie.
Trade Periodicals Discussed 
Seventy well-known periodicals, 
representing the printing industry 
and allied organizations all over 
the world, are discussed in the 
new publication.
Professor Gustafson stated that 
no student of printing can afford 
to overlook the contents of the' 
Graphic Arts Index in studying 
conditions pertaining to the print­
ing trades. It is the only complete 
work of its kind to come off the 
press. The first publication will 
be a limited edition.
A bulletin of the Department of 
Printing, mentions that Francis P. 
Dill ’32, of Worcester, Massachu­
setts, has had an article published 
in a recent number of the Publish­
er’s Weekly, one of the most im­
portant periodicals of the pub­
lishing world. Mr. Dill’s article 
concerned the “Importance of the 
17th Centry In History of Printing 
and Graphic Arts.”
From Sweden comes the an­
nouncement that a graduate of the 
Department of Printing, Bror 
Zaclirisson ’28, has been appointed 
editor of the Svenska Boktryckare 
Foreningens Meddelanden, the 
bookprinters’ and publishers', pe­
riodical of Sweden.

Fraternity Men 
Plan Year’s Work
At its weekly meetings, Inter­
fraternity Council has been formu­
lating plans for this year’s frater­
nity affairs. According to Bradley 
Edelblut '34, president of the 
Council, arrangements are under 
way for the Interfraternity Formal, 
the annual fraternity bridge 
tournament, and for intra-mural 
sports. Committees have been ap­
pointed from the members of 
Council to make further plans for 
all these events.
Interfraternity Council is espe­
cially interested in building up the 
fraternities financially, since it is 
believed that conditions in the 
houses can be improved through 
concerted effort. One of the first 
steps in this plan is the arrange­
ment for co-operative buying 
among the houses. By this plan, 
the fraternities will organize a 
unified purchasing body, which will 
increase buying power at cheaper 
rates. Bill Reed '34, of the Phi 
Kappa fraternity, is chairman of 
the committee for this plan. He is 
assisted by Kay Burns, Kappa 
Sigma fraternity; Edward Reese, 
of Delta Upsilon; and John M. 
Harvey, of Kappa Delta Rho.
James Stahl, last year’s presi­
dent of Interfraternity Council, has 
been appointed chairman of the 
annual bridge tournament. At the 
last meeting, he gave a talk ex­
plaining the system of duplicate 
bridge, as played in popular state 
and international tournaments. 
The duplicate tournament will be­
gin within the next two weeks and 
will continue for about three 
months. Boards will be played 
once a week.
.DeWolff Scliatzel, chairman of 
the Interfraternity Formal, Is mak­
ing arrangements for that dance. 
He has also announced that an In­
terfraternity tea dance may take 
place in connection with the ball.
The Council suggests that all 
freshman men look up fraternity 
rushing rules in this year’s stu­
dent handbook.

The Tri-Publications staff an­
nounces that this year’s Student 
Directory will bo available for pur­
chase Monday, November G, at the

SELECTED TO PLAY
Scabbard and Blade’s Call 
For Selected Officers 
Will Be Made
The election of Honorary Cadet 
officers and selection of Art Kas­
sel’s orchestra Indicate that plans 
for Carnegie’s Military Ball 
scheduled for November 10 are 
well under wTay.
The Military Ball has the dis­
tinction of beiug one of the out­
standing social functions of the 
first semester, and Is this year 
making a bid for the position of 
the most successful dance of the 
year.
The honorary officers, chosen re­
cently by a vote of the entire R. O. 
T. C. regiment, will receive com­
missions and shoulder ^ornaments 
at an Impressive ceremony to take 
place at midnight. This ceremony 
will be immediately followed by 
Scabbard and Blade’s Call for se­
lected senior and junior officers.
Art Kassel's Band To Play
The orchestra selected by De- 
Wolf Scliatzel and his committee 
is, in the opinion of many, the best 
orchestra that has played on the 
campus In the past three or four 
years. Art Kassel and Ills "Kas­
sels In the Air'1 have just complet­
ed a long term engagement at tho 
Hotel Bismarck in Chicago, whore 
they regu'arly broadcasted over 
Station WMAQ and the NBC net­
work. Tn addition to his radio 
broadcasting, phonograph record­
ing, and many famous engage­
ments, ho has the reputation of be­
ing one of the best orchestras in 
the West. At present he is tour­
ing the mlddlewest. His engage­
ment for tho Military Ball will 
mark Ills first appearance in the 
East for several years.
Art Kassel, In addition to his 
fame as an orchestra loader, lias 
quite a reputation as a composer 
of popular songs, among which aro 
the bit tunes, “Hells Bells” and 
“In 1933,” the theme song of tho 
Century of Progress Exposition.
Ticket Sale Limited
According to the publicity com­
mittee, headed by John O. Ord, 
there will be absolutely no more 
than 200 tickets sold for the donco, 
This limitation lias been agreed 
upon in order that Thistle Hall 
will not bo crowded. Frequently 
Thistle Hall has boon forced to ac­
commodate much larger crowds 
making dancing vory difficult. Such 
a condition will bo done away 
with this yoar. Tho tickets, al. 
three dollars a couple, wont ou 
salo last Wednesday, and can bo 
obtained from any member of Scab­
bard and Blade, or from Mr. Davis 
at the Y ofilco. The danco Is 
strictly formal. Full dross, tuxe­
dos,. and R. O. T. C. uniforms will 
bo worn, depending entirely upon 
the Individual’s wlslios In tho mat­
ter.
The commltteos wisli to< dispel 
any erroneous Idoa that tho ball 
is a military function only. As in 
tho past, tuxedos will probably 
outnumber uniforms, as the danco 
is always very popular with the 
non-mllttary students on the cam­
pus. ______________

1. That tho 1934 production of 
tho Bacchanalians bo presented

and tho problems and dangers 
arising through contracts niado 
with labor unions and off- 
campus agencies.
2. That ono complimentary ticket

Eight University Graduates Given 
Teaching Fellowships In Eng. College
Tartan Corrects 
Recent Mistake
In a recent edition of tho Tartan, 
research work done by Dr. II. C. 
Herly, director of research for tho 
Metallurgical Advisory Board, was 
wrongly credited to Dr. R. F. Melil, 
director of the Metals Research 
Laboratory.
Dr. Mjehl and his staff have made 
studies of iroiwnanganeso and 
iron-manganese-carbon alloys dur­
ing the past year. They have com­
pleted their investigation of the 
constitution of ternary iron-man- 
ganese carbon alloys with 2.5 and 
4.5 per cent manganese, and the 
electrical conductivity and thermal 
magnetic properties of binary iron- 
manganese alloys. Precipitation 
from solid solutions and internal 
strain In metals are Included in 
the new research program.
Dr. Herty and his staff have 
studied the control of iron oxide 
in open hearth. For the past sev­
eral years the problem of.' the re­
search staff has consisted chiefly 
in open hearth studies designed 
to enable the operator to control 
the finishing stages of liquid steel 
manufacture to a much finer de­
gree. *3^1
New Drill Schedule 
Arranged by R.O.T.C.
Whereas in previous years the 
Freshmen in the R. O. T. C. have 
drilled throughout the entire year,

ing the fall and spring.
Under the new arrangement 
they will receive indoor instruc­
tion during the colder months of 
the year, and will have thoir drills 
scheduled for the first fen weeks 
of Hie first semester. At prosent 
tho drills are going along smooth­
ly, and It is expected that tho 
change will bo highly successful.
TARTAN REPORTERS MEET
The Tartan freshman reporters 
will meet on Tuesday, a week from 
today. The class will assemble as 
usual in Room 115 in the Industries 
Building, at 12:30 p. m. This Is

Purdue Continues Record 
in 14-0 Win OverTough 
Wisconsin TeamPurdue Most Powerful 
J'oe on Plaid Card 
This Season
ALL-AMERICAN??
Future opponents of Carnegie 
Tech's gridders found the going to 
their liking last week-end. A num­
ber of them came through in great 
style.
Coach Sutherland's University of 
Pittsburgh Panthers further de­
flated Hunk Anderson’s once 
mighty Ramblers to the tune of 
14-0. Mike Sebastian, who can’t 
play unless he has glue on his 
mitts, managed to hold on to the 
oval for 75 yards and scored Pitt’s 
first touchdown in the second quar­
ter. An intercepted forward pass 
accounted for the other tally.
Purdue kept its slate clean by 
trouncing Wisconsin 14-0. As 
usual the Boilermakers scored on 
sensational runs and a good for­
ward passing attack. Nobel Kizer’s 
men scored in the second and 
fourth quarters and were never in 
danger.
Michigan State furnished the 
surprise of the day when they 
completely routed the hitherto un­
defeated Syracuse eleven by a 27-3 
count. The Michigan lads un­
corked a bewildering attack in the 
final period which brought three; 
touchdowns in a few minutes.
The Violets of old N. Y. U. 
proved no match for the powerful 
Georgia Bulldogs, the latter win­
ning 25-0. Temple was surprised 
by Bucltnell, the Warner men los­
ing 20-7. Xavier was also upset, 
Centre turning tho trick. The 
count was 7 to nix.
In other important games, Ford- 
liam scored a distinct upset when 
they smacked Aiapama’s great 
team, 2 to 0. Duquesne won from 
Westminster without getting up a 
sweat, and Ohio State came back 
to push over Illinois, 12-0.
Army slaughtered the Yale Bull­
dog, 21-0, and Lafayette held the 
highly heralded Colgate aggrega­
tion to a 0-0 count. Southern 
California found unexpected oppo­
sition in California and had to 
come back to win by 6-3. Stanford 
also tasted defeat.
Navy beat Penn, 13-0, in a sur­
prise party, and Michigan experi­
enced little trouble in overcoming 
Chicago, 28-0.
Pitt will have a letup this Sat-' 
urday when they face Centre at 
the Stadium, but Wasli-Jeff will 
have Duquesne to contend with. 
The Dukes are slight favorites, 
but the Prexies thrive on being the 
underdogs.
AFTER VIEWING LAST SATURDAY'S GAME WITH WASH-JEFF, It 
noomo to mo that tho coaching ctaff must have realized, by now at 
least, that tho weakness of tho Carnoglo eleven can bo pretty easily 
catalogued. My own conclusions wore (1) that defensively th.o Tartan 
line can take caro of Itoolf; (2) that tho running attack will never 
function worth a can of aoparagus until tho team otarts to do a little 
blocking (Butch Vordorbcrg seems to bo tho only man who known what 
It's all about In that department); (3) that duo to tho Impotoncy of the 
Carnoglo ground attack our opponents are getting wiso to the fact that 
thoy have nothing to worry about from that quarter and can plan their 
/defensives for the exclusive purpooo of stopping the Tartans’ claosy 
passing attack; and (4) tho passing attack of the Harpstermen Is 
hard to stop with any stylo defense.

POWERFUL Tartan forward wall did not look Tt effective eT if did 
against Temple and Notre Damo, but one must realize that neither 
of tiioso teams depended so ontirely on deception as did Hank Day's 
mon. Time and again Ilio Proxy backs ran up the center on fake 
»•oversoH and spinners. Whon It came down to Tartan territory, 
though, tho Carnegie lino was always moro than equul to tho situa­
tion.
That oighly-yard march of tho Presidents in tho third quarter, 
by tho way, was tho longest sustained marcii made by any team against 
the Pluid tills season.
Next Saturday, November 4( tho 
Carnegie football team will face 
the toughest grid competition of 
this season in the form of the 
crack club from Purdue University, 
of Lafayette, Indiana. In three 
years of Big Ten competition the 
Boilermakers have suffered but 
one defeat. In 1031 Purdue ex­
perienced a momentous upset in 
losing to an unexpectedly strong 
Wisconsin team, but the Boiler­
makers rallied at tho end of the 
season by crushing Northwestern 
to win the Big Ten Conference. 
Botli the year before and last year 
tho Lafayette club maintained an 
unbroken schedule of wins. So 
far this season Purdue is unbeaten, 
and can boast a list of really sub­
stantial victories. It is true that 
the Minnesota team held the Boil­
ermakers to a 7-7 tie, but that fact 
is no reflection on the Indiana boys 
for the Minnesota club is undoubt­
edly a lurge order of football com­
petition tills year.
Purdue Has Veteran Backs 
To strengthen the Purdue eleven 
Is a baCklleld which Is nearly the 
same as that of 1931, which was a 
parade of spectacularly efficient 
triple-threat men. The arrange­
ment is little changed from the '31 
lineup, and the group appears this 
year to bo equally dangerous. 
Although Purdue has had a suc­
cessful season so far, it cannot 
bo said that die foam’s victories 
have been exceedingly remarkable, 
and It sooms that the Boilermakers 
are perhaps not quite as strong as 
they have been in the past. The 
Plaid team, however, is undoubted­
ly a stronger club than it lias been 
for several years, so it is fair to 
say that next Saturday’s game 
will bo more of a draw than that 
of two yours ago, when the Purdue 
grlddors beat Carnoglo 13-0. If 
tho Tartans can lie filled with a 
large doso of tho Sldbo spirit, 
which has previously pepped tho 
dunamon into activity surmounta­
ble by no odds, they may bo able 
to deal a revengeful blow to the 
Boilermakers. In tho present 
standing of each team, Purdue Is 
tho most favored. Tech is woll 
awaro of tho opponent’s power and 
will ho ready for a hard and fast 
light, placing tho responsibility for 
tho offensive in tho execution of a 
woll-dovol’opod aerial attack. What­
ever success tho Plaid experiences, 
Saturday’s game will bo hard and
NOW TO TAKE UP BLOCKING. Carnoglo Tcoh has some small, 
shifty backs this year that could got away for touchdowns at will If 
they were given any docent support. Time and again last Saturday 
Bill Spisak was out in tho clear only to be brought down by either 
an end or a secondary man. The contrast between tho teams in this 
important department of tho gamo was quite evident In the press box. 
Several times Sklbo backs were brought down by Wash-Jcff ends be­
fore thoy could got under way, all because they had no one to stop 
thorn from coming In. On the other hand, during every end sweep 
)mado by tho rod and black Mr. Day had at least two men on Red Stew­
art and George Goodridgo. On the defense, the Carnegie ends were 
never given an even chance of smearing up tho play, In spite of the 
desperate efforts made by Stewart and Goodrldgc to evade the inter­
ference.

Carnegie Guard Makes Bid 
For All-American Position
IF THE OPPOSITION HAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT from the 
offense’s running attack, it’s a cinch that they should have little 
trouble stopping an aerial attack, no matter how good it Is. Red 
Grange in :i recent article in the Saturday Evening Post brought this 
out very effectively. Ho says that it is not difficult to stop a good 
passing attack or a good running attack, but trying to stop both sim­
ultaneously is a hprsG of a greatly different shade. If Carnoglo had a 
running attack that could keep tho defense eternally worried for fear 
Spisak or Toyobus might break away for a long sprint, their aerial 
dofensos would have to bo weakened In order to back up tho lino more 
effectively. This would make tho work of Messrs. Stewart, Lewis, and 
Goodridgo a groat deal simpler.* * * * * *
TI1E GAME PROBABLY DID MORE GOOD THAN HARM to tho Tar­
tan gridders, because thoy now realize that thoy aren’t as good us thoy 
thought thoy wore, and they may now turn their efforts to the diffi­
cult tasks thoy have ahead of them. This Saturday they play by far
tho toughest team on tho schedule, and il! thoy come through that game 
with their, record untarnished, the varsity will really have something 
to shout about. Coach Harpster can then conclude that all his work 
lias not boon in vain.

The next year Burzio did not 
play football but last year came 
back at the guard post to strength­
en considerably the center of the 
Tartan line. It was the stellar 
performances of Burzio and Sample 
that kept the Pitt score as low as 
it was and stopped the much 
Haunted Pitt running attack colder 
than a stepmother’s kiss.
This year he started out with a 
bang and gained recognition while 
the season was hardly under way 
by spending most of a Saturday 
afternoon in a bewildered Temple 
backfield. The wise boys started 
to look him over in practice and 
saw nothing as he is notoriously 
the laziest man on the squad in 
these sessions. However the next 
Saturday he turned in another fine 
performance and tne local scribes 
began to look up again. Against 
Notre Dame he wrote his name 
indelibly on the pages of Carnegie
In all its history Carnegie has 
had three official All-American 
stars and this year it is out to get 
its fourth. Bunny Burzio, from 
his play so far this year seems 
slated for a berth on the imaginary 
squad tills year. Bunny seems like 
a pertinent successor to other 
Carnegie immortals led by Harp­
ster, Yoder, and Rosenzweig on 
the national honorary football 
team. Carnegie has had mentions 
on the team for many years but it 
appears that the Plaid is due for 
its first big leaguer since 1929 in 
tho formidible personage of this 
year’s stellar guard.
He was first string guard as a 
sophomore on one of Carnegie’s 
strongest football machines along 
with Sample, as smooth a guard as 
Tech had seen in many years, with 
whom lie alternated. On this same 
loam was Carnegie’s last truly

Unusual Event Will Be Held 
In Thistle Hall This 
Saturday Evening
Something new and different will 
take place in Thistle Hall this Sat­
urday evening. The Night College 
of Fine Arts will hold its first 
danfee of the year in the form of 
an Autumn Festival, and to say 
that this affair will be different is 
hardly enough. Mother Nature will 
furnish the theme for the decora­
tions that will make a gay back­
ground for the evening’s entertain­
ment. The spirit of the season, 
Hallowe’en, autumn, pumpkins and 
all will be very much in evidence.
The newly elected officers have 
planned an affair that will be 
unique and long remembered. The 
music for the affair will be fur­
nished by a well-known orchestra, 
so that the success of the evening 
will be assured.
Only regularly registered night 
students of the Fine Arts school 
are eligible to attend this affair. 
Admission can be gained by show-
The first semester smoker of the 
College of Engineering was held in 
the Union on Saturdajr, October 21. 
At this smoker, the four class of­
ficers were elected. The smoker 
was officially opened by Mr. A. J. 
Lois, the retiring president. After 
the opening address, Professor 
Leigliou spoke. His talk was fol­
lowed by a "Mickey Mouse” movie, 
which was well received, for even 
the engineers get frivolous at 
times. After the movie, Mr. Mc- 
Kelway told one of his very amus­
ing stories which, as usual, nearly 
bi*ought down the house. When the 
uproar had subsided, a sleight-of- 
hand artist was introduced who 
kept the audience guessing while 
he performed some very interest­
ing and original tricks. The en­
tertainment features of the even­
ing were then suspended for a 
while and the serious business of 
the meeting was considered.
Mr. Lois called the meeting to 
order and then announced the, 
opening of nominations for the 
election. Mr. R. W. Lalir was un­
animously nominated for presi­
dent, and as there were no other 
nominees, he was automatically 
elected. Mr. W. A. Vensel, Mr. T. 
J. Werner and Mr. A. C. Grimm 
were elected vice president, treas­
urer and secretary, respectively.
While the ballots were being 
counted, a “Krazy Kat” movie was 
presented. After the picture the 
results of the election were an­
nounced and Mr. A. W. Luck sang 
for the assembly and his songs 
were very well received by the au­
dience. The smoker concluded 
with a tasty lunch.
It’s easy to understand why 
the young folks are smoking 
Granger... i/^ made to

Believe you me, we, or rather I 
was wrong about the horse, chains, 
etc., etc. I looked around the 
campus a bit and there as broad as 
life itself were the old zebras, a 
name given to the wooden horses 
by last year’s columnist. They 
were guarding the portals of the 
quadrangle drive in front of Arts 
and Maggie Murphy. Now I’m 
really perturbed, (that’s something 
like disturbed I believe and is at 
least a thirty-five cent word) over 
the situation and what am I going 
to do about it—nothing.
But hold on, yes sir, they really 
went and done it. Yea boy. Our 
chariots now have stalls for park­
ing in. Wonder whose spirit 
moved them to be so kind as to 
place white lines, yes I said white 
lines, for us to park between. It 
Isn’t every place that you would 
•find such parking accommodations. 
Bet Mr. Orbin has one of those 
stalls chartered for his honored 
chariot. The whole thing is unbe­
lievable, coming at this time and 
in such a place. The next thing 
¦will be, well let me see—what can 
J point out.
. Well, we might put a moving 
walk from the car line at More- 
wood avenue right to Administra­
tion building; we might put in 
•elevators for the general use in 
Arts; we might put in loud speak­
ers to broadcast all the speeches 
we have heard during the past two 
weeks on the night canipus, or 
would a talking movie be better. 
We could then catch some of the 
motions and gesticulations in­
dulged in by the “wlios-shots” over 
this and that, which by the way 
makes one feel that they regard 
the welfare of the whole world as 
depending upon the outcome of the 
three battle royals just staged.
And if all the things mentioned 
in the preceding paragraph would 
not be sufficient, well we could 
start anew by placing a new light 
•over—you're wrong, I wasn't going 
to say Arts, but Langley Lab. The 
tittle glimmers at the entrances of 
the Lab seem to be inadequate for 
the purpose intended, but then, 
-everyone isn’t blind like I am.
Did you notice the way the Drum 
Major struts his stuff before the 
Kilties? Between the swishing of 
the kilt, the manipulation of the 
long range baton, and the knock­
ing of his knees (when it’s cold, 
I’ll bet be wishes he had more

the Plaid staff wishes to inform 
the student body that it is not 
necessary to be a member of the 
staff in order to have a contribution

Class Routine Claims 
Students’ Attention
© 1935, Liccnrr & Mvims pten..t htv
Now that all the handshaking, 
renewing of acquaintances, orien­
tation and general settling down 
are over, the process of absorbing 
knowledge has begun to operate in 
dead earnest. It is always surpris­
ing to note that the rushing about 
and confusion that accompanies 
the first few weeks of school al­
ways seems to cease suddenly. 
There is no apparent transition 
stage. One week, everyone is 
dashing about bunting class rooms, 
old friends, misplaced books, await­
ing companions, and so forth. The 
next week, all this has disappear­
ed, and the halls become sedately 
quiet.
The quiet atmosphere suddenly 
transforms what was originally an 
unorganized crowd into the well 
regulated smooth-running organiza­
tion that the night school really 
is. The transition soon becomes 
part of the students and the quiet 
way in which they go about their 
tasks is an outward indication of 
their internal determination.

day evening, at 8:00 o’clock, in 
room 104, Industries Building. This

«of Electrical Engineers, featured 
an extensive display of electrical

aome of their practical problems.
Dr. Thomas pointed out that, 
while the equipment and illustra­

CURRENT OPINION
Combined D.ning Hall
Al; present Carnegie operates a dining hall in the Commons, 
Carnegie Inn, •Mellon Hall, and Forbes Hall. Each of these din­
ing halls demands' separate management, equipment, and 
kitchens. This is a duplication of services that does not seem 
necessary and wastes the school’s as well as the students’ 
money.
It has been estimated that if these four dining halls were 
combined into one building in a central location on the campus, 
a saving oi! at least 10 per cent in the cost of operation would 
be effected. This saving would be passed along to the student 
in the form of lower food prices.
The idea of a combined dining hall will probably raise the 
objection that the dormitory girls prefer to eat with their own 
group. The girls could continue to eat with their own group 
for the proposed central building could be separated into divi­
sions such as a low-priced cafeteria, a higher priced dining room 
with table service, and a private dining room for the dormitory 
groups. The saving will be realized by the use of a single 
kitchen and simplicity in management.
Carnegie is now operating its dining halls without profit 
and is giving the students the lowest prices possible under the 
present four dining room plan. If prices seem to be high it is 
because there is an unnecessary duplication of services.
FORMAL COURSE SAVES
University of Wisconsin, which 
3aeT made the name of Madison a 
symbol of liberalism in education, 
Is to offer its student body a course 
In debunking. It Is rather amus­
ing, In view of Wisconsin’« repu­
tation an a university willing to 
espouse the minority viewpoint, 
that the university dons should find 
II, necessary to subject their stu­
dent« to any further exploding of 
popular fallacies. At Wisconsin, 
and for that matter at our own 
unlverHlty, the «tudents of liberal 
arts change» his Ideas pretty swift­
ly without the aid of any course 
devoted exclusively to blasting 
myths.
But. Wisconsin, apparently, 3w 
not taking any chances. Their 
cour»e will make it possible for 
Htudents to learn the folly of "Buy 
American" without taking a course 
in economics, or to find out that 
Clermany Is not solely responsible 
for the World War without taking 
a history course,
To find out than an old, common 
Idea 1b entirely mistaken Is a stim­
ulating spiritual experience. Once 
the diBcovery De made, the Btudent 
Bliould have tho pleasure of playing 
the debunker, by bringing the word 
to his acquaintances who have not 
yet seen the light, but tho best 
part of the whole experience is 
that tho Htmlent has to do a little 
digging himself In order that Ills 
ideas may undergo the change 
which comes with a college educa­
tion. To set up the fallacies in 
wholesale antity and then knock 
them .down while the students sits 
by and watches smacks much of 
predigestion. — Tho Minnesota 
Dally.

ON SECOND THOUGHT
WAR CLOUDS AND STUDENT 
PACIFISM
By Will Lnndtibei’a
Student polls held- last year In 
mdhy colleges throughout the coun­
try showed a two to one victory for 
pacifism. Although these students 
expressed various degrees of paci­
fism in their refusal to bear arms, 
it was undoubtedly a surprise to 
the public that they should take 
any such Btand.
But now that definite war clouds 
are hanging over Europe we won­
der if a student poll would show 
the same result. It is one thing 
to oppose the bearing of arms 
when there is no necessity to bear 
them; it is quite another when 
the threat of armed conflict Is im­
minent.
We do not doubt the sincerity of 
the high-minded collegiates who, 
oppose tho bearing of arms but we 
sometimes do doubt their common 
sense. Abolition of war is a* goal 
for which all but the most rabid 
jingoes will work. That the pres­
ent state of civilization does not 
permit men to act unitedly seems 
to be a sad truth. Economic and 
political rivalries, allegiance to 
selfish leadership, tho general mis­
trust of men for other men when 
thoy know nothing about each 
othor—these aro some of the trou­
bles that tho scrapping of arms And 
the avowed refusal to bear thorn 
cannot epDtp , , ,

‘FOR ALL’S FAIR WEATHER
Little Theater Review
By JANE M. LIVINGSTON
The Department of Drama, in se­
lecting Paul Green’s “The Field 
God," as the opening production of 
the Little Theater season, has 
proven itself unusually venture­
some in Its work, for it is apparent 
that had this piece been presented 
much later in the year, there would 
have been a smoothness and finish 
now lacking. The attempt, how­
ever, Is not to the discredit of the 
studehts, who succeeded at mo­
ments in giving understanding 
portrayals of the characters.
Paul Green, the author of “The 
Field God,” first gained acclaim 
about six years ago when the play 
was staged on Broadway. Since 
then he has been termed the best 
folk-dramatist in our country. In 
tills piece as in his others, he pre­
sents the rural life of the Caro- 
linas with which he is thoroughly 
intimate and which he has drawn 
with clear-cut sincerity and pene­
trating sympathy.
The plot of the play has been 
outwardly built-up on tho worn- 
thin thrend of the triangle, but 
since Paul Green centers his in­
terest in the underlying reactions 
and adjustments of Individuals 
thero is no forced theatricalism 
j about the piece. The author uses 
the story only as a link in spirit 
betwoen his audience and charac­
ters. He has doplcted Hardy Cil- 
1 ohvlflt with TV’oclne interpretation
against the background of his com­
munity, a group whose isolation 
makes them cling to the realities 
of earth, and the seeming reality 
of religion. Gilchrist, holding the 
opinions of a free-thinker, disre­
gards orthodox religion and in this 
respect comes into conflict with 
those neighbors, who, in their need 
of a hero, have made of him a 
"field god.” It is Gilchrist, in the 
end, who succumbs to the panacea 
of religion and prayer, to the com­
fort of the group, as an escape 
from his hardships and worries, 
but his influence has been strong 
enough to infuse Into his friends 
the feeling that his devotion to his 
wife is a symbol of their own 
faith, and one that is representa­
tive for them of their hero.
George McCalmon, as the farmer, 
did not seem to gain the conviction 
of his role until the final scenes. 
Viola Sayles gavo a poignant por­
trayal as his first wife. Jean 
Speller as a day laborer, Howard 
Watkins and Barry Mulligan as 
country jrokels Avere skillful in 
their interpretations, and Donald 
Gallegher was an excellent Billy 
Sunday.

What started out to be another football dance 
was turned into a hilarious hallowe’en party last 
Saturday. The usual dignity which accompanies 
Thistle Hall affairs was cast aside and the crowd 
found themselves in for an old-fashioned whistle­
blowing, horn-tootin’ good time.
The party was such a big success that it’s a 
wonder that it hasn’t been done before in the 
Hall. The rural decorations and the fine music 
helped to make things real informal.
Dick Hammond and Dolly Bateman were seen 
swiping pumpkins. Artz and Hudson were up to 
no good as usual. Rae Jones Cwho now lives in 
Nebraska) felt right at home with the cornhusks 
and hayseed Macalka. Chuck Erich and Marion 
Romp were there as were Jerry Hanson and Joan 
Norton. Bill Holiday appeared with Tommy 
Evans and Paul Moore came as usual with Jane 
Stevenson. If you like Swedes, Jimmy Connors 
and Lois Connelly might do. Ex-Campus Queen 
Kay Wholey was seen with DeWolf Shatzel. Ed

added to the confusion.

like a dictator and the supremo 
court combined.’’
On the other hand, Johnson has 
taken the position that there must 
be an end to the uncertainty as to 
whether Ford is or Is not comply­
ing. It is impossible for the gov­
ernment to be taking Blue Eagles 
out of beauty parlor windows, and 
at the same time allowing an indus­
trialist of such national importance 
to pursue a course outside of NRA. 
And so taking steps to dispel this 
uncertainty, the government has 
demanded of the Detroit manufac­
turer that he turn over wage and 
hour statistics to. the National Au­
tomobile Chamber of Commerce, 
which is the motor code authority. 
Refusal to comply with this will 
mean that his case will be given 
the department of justice for prose­
cution.
As yet, no official statement as 
to his intentions have been re­
ceived from Ford but there are 
strong, unofficial intimations at 
Dearborn that ho intends to turn 
tho statistics in. Ilowevor, if the 
auto magnate undorgoos a change 
of mind, does not comply, and tho 
case goos to tho department of
