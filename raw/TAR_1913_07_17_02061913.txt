In a well-played game Bethany went 
down to defeat before the Varsity 
last Friday night, January 31, by a 
score of 42-26. Our boys had the 
big end of the argument all the way 
through and won by superior team­
work- and shooting. Tumpane was a 
revelation in speed, scoring 11 baskets. 
The rest of the team deserve a good 
deal of credit for the way in which 
they fed the ball to this little forward, 
but his accuracy in locating the hoop 
was the deciding feature. Metheny 
also displayed skill in shooting, secur­
ing four baskets. Colvin, as usual, 
excelled in “the work of his position 
and floor work. His passing was fast 
and accurate, and he had no trouble 
out jumping his opponent. The guards, 
Hines, Metheny and Heisel, covered 
their men well, keeping them out of 
danger, and held the ball in their own 
end of the floor for most of the game. 
The lineup:
Carnegie—42. Bethany—26.

WEDNESDAY MORNING 
LECTURE
Wednesday morning the general 
lecture hour was given to two rep­
resentatives of the Pittsburgh Inter­
collegiate Committee for Social Service, 
an organization of 20 college gradu­
ates, all business and professional men 
of this city, and represented at Car­
negie Tech by Mr. Field and Mr. 
Williams. The speakers were Mr. A. 
M. Scully, chairman, and Mr. Sherrard 
Ewing, secretary of the committee. 
Each gave a short talk on the aims 
and methods, and the work already 
accomplished by the committee, and 
showed the great need for such a 
movement in this city. Following 
their talks, a call was made by Pres. 
Crawford, of the Senior Class, for 
volunteers to serve on a school “Civic” 
committee and several men responded.
ADDRESSED BY DEAN 
CONNELLEY
Dean Connelley was the main 
speaker at the noon-day luncheon of 
the Chamber of Commerce of .Ashta­
bula, Ohio, on last Monday. His sub­
ject was “Industrial Education,” show­
ing how it is a step in advance in 
things educational, being eminently in 
tune with the spirit of the times. He 
also developed the idea that vocational 
education has considerable economic 
significance and as such was the logical 
solution to the problem of conserva­
tion of our natural resources as well 
as Protection for Home Industries. 
He further showed it to be an im­
portant factor in the moral issues of 
the nation, concluding with “Train the 
child through the successive stages of 
manual and industrial arts, as well 
the necessary academic training, until 
he has reached his majority and he 
will enter into real life with a sense 
of the dignity of labor and, whether 
he remains in the industrial army as 
a skilled worker or becomes a cap­
tain of industry, he will never depart 
far enough away from his training 
tot)e a party to any of the abominable 
conditions in the business world of 
which the recent example of govern­
ment by dynamite is but an exagger­
ated type.”
In the evening the Dean gave an 
illustrated lecture, showing views of 
the institute and industrial work in 
the Pittsburgh Public Schools. This 
lecture was given at Elm Street Meth­
odist Church, Ashtabula, under the 
auspices of the Methodist Men’s Club. 
A similar lecture was given before the 
institute of the Connellsville schools 
on last Thursday.
NO GAME THIS WEEK
On account of examinations, the 
game with Westinghouse for this 
week was postponed. The next home 
game will be with Grove City on 
Thursday night, February 13, the 
game to start at 8:30.
A novel feature is being planned 
for the Muskingum game on the night 
of February 28. This is the date of 
the Junior Prom, so in order that 
the underclassmen may be at least 
partly consoled for not being invited, 
the athletic authorities are arranging 
for a special dance for the Sophs and 
Plebes on that night. The regular 
admission will admit to the game and 
the dance, but special features will be 
added to make the night one to be 
remembered. Fuller details will be 
announced later in the Tartan.
GROVE CITY WINS BY ONE 
POINT
Although outplayed by the Varsity, 
the Grove City College team nosed 
out a victory by one point on Tues­
day evening, January 28. The game 
was played at Grove City but the 
home team, with the advantage of 
their own floor, were outclassed. The 
referee imposed most of the penalties 
on the visitors, and this fact decided 
the final score. Both teams put up 
a fast game, and the Red and White 
had a slight lead at the end of the 
first half. In the second period, the 
Plaid five ran away from their oppo­
nents and held them without allowing 
a basket to be thrown from the floor. 
Tumpane and Metheny were the stars, 
but all of the boys were in the game 
all of the time. Colvin especially was 
good at guarding and floor work and 
led his team at a fast clip. The lineup: 
Carnegie—22. Grove City—23.
Tumpane ............F.... McGranahan
Criswell ...............F.....................Bastress
Colvin ...................C....................... Black
Hines ...................G....................... Bigler
Metheny...............G..................... Turner
Field goals: Tumpane 3, Metheny
3, Hines, McGranahan 2, Black 2, 
Bastress. Foul goals: Criswell 4 out 
of 9, Metheny 2 out of 5, Colvin missed
1, Bastress 13 out of 18. Referee: 
Achre.
GENEVA DEFEATED IN FAST 
GAME
In a well-played game, the Varsity 
easily defeated the Geneva College 
five on Monday night, January 27, 
at Beaver Falls. The final score was 
41 to 25. The Plaid five had the best 
of the contest in every department 
and never had any difficulty. The 
passing and the teamwork was the 
feature, although all of the men were 
able to locate the basket with ease. 
The home team scored 11 of their 
points on fouls, having a total of but 
seven baskets.
Criswell starred in the first period 
in the shooting, but the ball was fed 
to Tumpane in the second half and 
he, with the guards, did all of the 
scoring. Colvin outjumped Patterson 
at every whistle, and Metheny, who 
played the latter half of the second 
period, also had the advantage. The 
lineup:
Carnegie-—41. Geneva—25.
Criswell ..............F................................................ Quay
Tumpane ............F................... Stauffer
Colvin ..................C............... Patterson
Hines ...................G.................. Downie
Heisel .................G...................... Clyde
Substitutions: Metheny for Colvin,
Williams for Hines, Yahres for
THE THISTLE BALLOT
At last is revealed the object of the 
ballot attached to each Thistle re­
ceipt. We are to have a popularity 
contest. Does that sound interesting? 
Well rather. Each ballot entitles the 
holder to one vote for the person who 
is in his mind the most popular person 
in his school. Or if it is so desired, 
he may vote for a person in some 
other school; as will probably occur 
in the cases of many of our gallant 
young men whose thots turn to M. M.
C. S. But one vote will be allowed 
for each ballot and the final results 
will show who is the most popular 
person in the M. M. C. S. in the 
Science School, in the Design School 
and in the Industries School. A space 
will be reserved in the Thistle f°r 
the pictures of these four people and 
the honor of receiving the distinction 
should be highly appreciated. Who’s 
your favorite? Are you strong enough 
for her (or him) to get around and 
stir up some interest? The enthusiasm 
displayed on the part of the Depart­
ment of Illustration and Decoration 
in the School of Applied Design with 
reference to the art features in the 
Thistle is more than promising for 
the welfare of- the publication. The 
faculty have seen the practical value 
of the opportunities presented by the 
call for material and to take full ad­
vantage of it have further stimulated 
interest by giving regular credit on 
all work done for the Thistle. The 
student is given the opportunity to 
do his work just as he would have to 
do it, were he in the actual business 
of making illustrations and under the 
necessity of keeping in mind the vari­
ous points on which the engraver is 
very touchy, methods of reduction, the 
value of the different tones after the 
picture has been reduced and in fact 
all of the details that the commercial 
artist must observe. Several of the 
programs deal directly with some of 
the subjects needed in the book and 
in such cases, there will be a great 
variety of types and styles from which 
will be selected the best drawing. All 
of which brings about the confident 
assurance that the 1913 Thistle will 
be the biggest and best ever.

THE TARTAN
AT IT AGAIN
Published weekly by the Undergraduates 
of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Business communications should be 
addressed to the BUSINESS EDITOR; 
all articles and other communications 
should be sent to the EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.
. SUBSCRIPTION RATES 
Yearly $1.00 5c per Copy
Entered in the Post Office of Pitts­
burgh as second class matter.
PITTSBURGH, PA., Feb. 6, 1913.
Due to the fact that this is exam­
ination week, the Tartan is of four 
pages only.
By the time that this issue is placed 
in the hands of the student body the 
period of examinations will be all but 
over — except for those who meet 
with misfortune, and the Tartan hopes 
that they will be few in number. 
Examinations are—to put it mildly—a 
bore to the instructor and to the 
student. To the man who invents a 
method of obtaining the value of a 
student’s work without the giving of 
examinations should be given a Car­
negie Hero Medal. (Will all the out- 
of-town papers please copy).
Next week we have the pleasure of 
experiencing the inspection trips. Men 
from Carnegie will go, not only to 
plants in this district, but to some 
of those as far away as Buffalo and 
New York. The Tartan hopes that 
the impression created by the students 
on these trips will be such that all 
of the Seniors will secure positions 
inside of a month.
This may be an unfortunate time to 
speak of the matter, but have you 
heard anything of the suggestion to 
collect the trophies and provide a 
proper resting place for them? If you 
have not, why have you not, as would 
say our friend of last year, Chairman 
Henderson, of the Smoking Room 
Committee. This is a matter which 
would require little in the way'of 
effort to have attended to, and which 
would prove a lasting benefit. Put 
the thought away in the back of your 
head and, once the unmentionables are 
over, bring it forth and get some 
action on it.
IMPORTANT
List to the Words of the Wise
'‘We have met the enemy and they 
are ours.” With the same expression 
or one equal to it, the Third Year 
Night Science greeted one another 
at the German Club on Saturday 
evening, January 25, and the “sur­
vival of the fittest” sat around the 
banquet table to dispel all the gloom 
occasioned- by the “exams.”
A battle for supremacy was waged 
during the evening by Mike Floyd 
and “Massa” Sullivan, who poured 
out their entire store of wit in order 
to secure the title “Story teller.” 
However, the judges could not come 
to any decision for at the time of 
adjournment the tales were still being 
told.
Mr. L. Koenig, at the piano, demon­
strated clearly the difference between 
playing piano, or trying to play a 
piano. Not only did he favor us with 
the popular “rag,” but by special re­
quest, he played the real “classic” and 
displayed true talent.
In Mr. Harry, we discovered a 
tenor of merit, and not only did. he 
please us with several solos, but con­
sented to lead the “Third Year Night 
Quartet” on—well, on to victory.
To make special mention of all 
stars would mean the writing of a 
book, as I shall summarize by saying 
“Everbody was doing it,” and every­
body was happy.
Our guests were surely welcomed 
and we can only say “Come again, 
you are surely welcome.”
TOURNAMENT CLOSES THIS 
WEEK
Mr. Haaren, presiding at Thistle 
Board meeting: “Ideas are not worth
a ---------- if we don’t have money to
put them into print.” This is very 
plain in its import and means—liter­
ally get your Thistle receipt.
Look for the schedule of drawings 
requTred for the Thistle. You may 
have a chance to work out a clever 
scheme and bring fame to yourself.

The announcement of special after­

offered. They are as follows:
Ceramics—A course of 12 lessons 
designed for those who desire instruc­
tion in ceramics as a craft adaptable 
for home development. Students will

and use of throwing wheel and in 
such other pottery work, including 
glazing and use. of kiln, as can be 
given in the short time allotted to 
this course.
Lace Making—A course of 12 les­
sons designed for instruction in the

to its use as a home craft. Students 
will be instructed in the materials 
used, the adaptation of designs, and 
of the simpler varieties of lace used 
for dress and home decoration.
Weaving—A course of 12 lessons 
designed for home use. Work will be 
offered on a number of different

WHY IS A MOUSE
Why is a mouse when it spins? 
Here’s a chance to help yourself to a 
dollar by exercising your ingenuity.
Each person buying a Thistle receipt 
has a chance to guess the answer and 
the answer thought cleverest among 
those submitted will free the guesser 
from further financial obligation in 
obtaining his Thistle. In other words 
the receipt of the fortunate person 
will entitle him to his book without 
paying the other dollar. The staff of 
the Thistle will act as judges and the 
only requirement to enter the com­
petition is that you own a receipt and 
that you place your idea of the appro­
priate answer on a slip of paper with 
your name and place the same in any 
of the Thistle boxes. Here’s a chance
to turn in something good in the way 
of grinds and there is no doubt but 
that some very bright and clever 
answers will be turned in.
HOME CONCERT BEST EVER
Next Friday night the Musical 
Clubs will take a trip over to Aspin- 
wall to furnish music for the young 
women of the U. P. Church. There 
are still a few dates on file to com­
plete, before the giving of the “Home 
Concert” in March, which will all go 
to make a more finished concert for 
the latter function. It is expected 
.that this year will mark a new era of 
music at this institution, the gradual 
advance of the Musical Clubs, the 
‘organizing of the “Orchestra,” and 
the installing of the school of music, 
will cause jnusical critics of Pitts­
burgh to take notice. We can safely 
say the coming “Home Concert” will 
be the greatest ever, and no student 
will go wrong by preparing for it 
immediately. Last week two con­
tracts were signed for concerts in two 
leading cities in West Virginia.
CARNEGIE MECHANICAL EN­
GINEERING SOCIETY
A short business meeting of the 
society was followed by a delightful 
talk on the Lentz engine by Mr. A. 
Siegfried Rosenschweiz. The lecture 
was illustrated by a number of inter­
esting slides showing details of con­
struction and comparisons with other 
engines. Pictures were shown of 
applications of the Lentz engine to 
locomotive service, marine use and as 
a prime mover for electrical work. 
The advantages and disadvantages 
were well threshed out in the discus­
sion, and the large crowd which at­
tended the meeting felt well repaid 
for coming out, especially when the 
feed was served.
The meeting adjourned early in 
order to have a picture of the society 
for publication in the Thistle.
THISTLE PHOTOS—IM­
PORTANT
The Thistle photographic studio on 
the top floor of the Design Building 
is now open and ready for business. 
All Seniors will please get over there 
and get their pictures taken as soon 
as possible. The tax on individual 
pictures will be only $1.00, for your 
picture for the engraver. Special 
prices will be made to those ordering 
pictures made from the negatives. 
See sample at studio. Organizations 
will help wonderfully if they will go 
over to the studio and get their pic­
tures taken. See Madison for sched­
ule of time to go over. This is a 
big opportunity and should be used
i. the best advantage. It saves a 
trip to town. Get busy.
