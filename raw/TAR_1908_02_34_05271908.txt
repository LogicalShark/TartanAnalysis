TECH WINS INTERCOLLEGIATE MEET
On Saturday afternoon the intercollegiate 
field meet was held at Friendship Park. The 
State team did not appear as the faculty had 
prohibited the entering of several men on ac­
count of low grades. The final score stood 82 
points for Tech, 6\l/2 for Wup., 17 for Geneva, 
and il/2 for Marietta. Capt. Quince Banbury 
was not up to his usual form and in fact ought 
not to have attempted to compete as it is said 
he is on the sick list, threatened with typhoid 
fever. Two records were broken, namely, the 
hammer throw moved up to 140 feet 10 inches, 
done by Zieg of Wup; Van Doren putting the 
shot 39 feet 5 inches. Capt. Dowling was the 
star-point winner of the meet, .while Halferty, 
Bates and Griffith tied with ten points. A 
large and enthusiastic crowd was present and 
Tech rooters were much in evidence. Sum­

WASHINGTON & JEFFERSON WINS 
FROM TECH.
On Friday the new field was again tried
out but was decidedly heavy, the outfield being
about ankle deep in mud. Up until the fifth
inning it was anybody’s game but W. & J. had
a big lead. Burgham brought in three runs in
the eighth inning 011 a two base hit while
Barclay had a nice put out at home on a
throw from Burgham.
The following is the way the runs were scor­ed :
Burgham scored for Tech in the fourth on 
his hit, going to third on Harrison’s sacrifice 
and coming home on McKinley’s drive into 
middle. Henning opened the fifth with a single 
and scored 011 Ramsey’s double, the Peerless 
Leader coming home on Ward’s double. “Red” 
Orr walloped one for two and then Ingham 
and Duffy singled, Orr and Ingham scoring 
on Duffy’s hit.
With one out in the eighth Lytle and Burn­
side singled and Duffy fumbled Barclay’s 
roller. Burgham cleaned the sacks with a 
double past Stewart. After this hitfest W. and 
J. started again. Stewart and Donnan got on 
bases through fielders’ choices and forces, and 
with two out Marshall hit to Burgham, who 
fumbled the ball and therr threw late to Mc­
Kinley, both runners scoring.
Lytle made two pretty catches in right 
which were the fielding features. Score:

SEWICKLEY LOSES TO TECH.
Carnegie Tech at Sewickley Saturday de­
feated the Y. M. C. A. team in its opening 
game 5 to 3. It was a game full of fine plays, 
the Tech outfielders having 10 putouts, of 
which number Crumley, in left had five. The 
outfield was very slow, being soggy, due to 
rains.
The feature was a catch by Crumley, who 
after slipping and falling, due to the condition 
of the field( regained his feet and caught the 
ball. If the ball had gotten by him, it would 
have been good for at least three bases.
Coach Wolfe tried out two pitchers, both of 
whom showed up well. Sugden started the 
game and pitched six innings, during which 
period Sewickley could only find him for three 
hits. He was steady, issuing but one free 
ticket to first. Burnside, who relieved Sug­
den in the sixth, held Sewickley to one hit 
during the rest of the game.
Dolan, who pitched for Sewickley, was a 
little erratic, issuing five free tickets to first. 
He proved his pitching ability by striking out 
six Tech men.

Sewickley was first to score. Neely, the first 
man up, hit to Kirk, who made a wild throw, 
stole second and third, and came home on 
a ball hit right through Caldren. During the 
next three innings Sewickley failed to score.
Tech went Sewickley one better in its half 
of the third. Barclay started the inning by 
making a clean hit. Lytle duplicated. Caldren 
was given his base on balls, filling the bases. 
McKinley hit to Neely, who threw Barclay 
out at home. Crumley hit to Sweeney, who 
fumbled, and then threw McKinley out at sec­
ond, Lytle scoring. Kirk made a clean hit, 
scoring Caldren.
Tech in the fifth scored two runs. Lytle 
reached first on the shortstop's fumble, Cal­
dren was hit by a pitched ball; then McKinley 
hit, scoring Lytle. Crumley flew out to the 
pitcher. Kirk hit the ball to short, who en­
deavored to get Caldren at home, but was too 
late to catch his man. Slocum struck out, and 
Harrison went out from pitcher to first. Tech 
did not score again until the eighth.
In Sewickley’s half of the fifth, Sweeney 
was given a base on balls. Peters flew out 
to Crumley, Dolan went out from Caldren to 
first, advancing Sweeney to second. On 
Neely’s hit Sweeney scored. Gosnell struck 
out.
Sewickley scored again in the sixth. Wil­
son hit, advanced to second on Walker’s sacri­
fice, Sugden to McKinley, and came home on 
McPherson’s hit.
Tech scored again in the eighth. Leety, who 
replaced Slocum, went out from second to 
first. Harrison singled and was advanced to
second by Burnside and scored on Caldren’s 
hit, Burnside being thrown out at the plate.

It is a noticeable feature of the choice of 
option lately exercised by the Plebes that those 
courses which had the best social organizations 
and the fewest number of hard studies were 
crowded to the limit. This may be due merely 
to coincidence but such could hardly be the 
case. It would seem from an inspection of 
the selections that some one or two students 
in each section have become the “bell cow" 
and that the others are merely falling in be­
hind. The best plan to follow before choosing 
a course is to consult the heads of the various 
departments privately and have a talk 011 the 
subject. Do not visit only one or your choice 
may be biased by the glowing picture of the 
profession which an interested enthusiast may 
draw for you. In no case, however, rely on 
the judgment of such of your fellow students 
who have had no experience in the line of work

It is to be hope that the Tech band will

graduation. It would seem that the men who

they would push matters and have the band in

It seems an unfortunate circumstance that 
the Senior Class is not to have the support

is surprising too, that the large number who

In every effective musical composition we 
have our pianissimo passages as well as our 
largo and fortissimo, and the former often 
haunt the memory longer than the latter. Just 
so in our Faculty, we have our pedal basses, 
some with and some without vox humana con­
trol. We also have our middle register but 
there is no other tuned to the quiet restful 
adaggio movement of H.'Leland Lowe. The 
mere incident of the school which he claims 
as his alma mater we are forced to pass over as 
with singular thoughtlessness, for him, he 
neglected to remain in any of them throughout 
the course, but distributed his favor among 
several. This thoughtlessness becomes more 
criminal when we realize how difficult it be­
comes to run down and exterminate the source 
of those 20th century tortures, the heat equa­
tion, and (ti—12).
Mr. Lowe once made an exhaustive study 
of hypnotism and while we will treat with con­
tempt the suggestion that his fickle choosing 
in the matter of an alma mater was due in 
some degree to an inability to hypnotize the 
professors; yet we know that at present his 
powers in that direction inspire the unintiated 
with terror. To see these powers exemplified 
most any day, all that is necessary is to pro­
ceed to the department that has bulled the 
instrument market for the last couple of years 
and looking through the forest of Crookes 
tubes, induction coils, radio pyrometers and 
all that appertain thereto we see a quiet

scholarly looking theological student thought­
fully eyeing a blackboard filled with heiro- 
glyphics. We are undeceived as to the 
theological student part, however, when he 
proceeds to juggle these aforementioned heiro- 
glyphics dexterously around and finally fin­
ishes with a formula in the lower right hand 
corner of the board in a spot thoughtfully left 
unsoiled by Mr. Hower. All the time this 
manipulation goes on he holds his audience 
spellbound and it is no uncommon thing for an 
entire class to assure him they understand per­
fectly, while yet under the influence of his 
powers.
Mr. Lowe, owing to an orthodox raising, 
follows the Biblical injunction to temper the 
wind to the shorn lamb, and half the sting of a 
flunk is taken away when we .realize that he 
feels deeply for us and in fact is more worried 
about it than we are ourselves. As to his 
ability, the mere fact that he has managed to 
inculcate some knowledge of heat and thermo­
dynamics upon material possessing the“infinite 
capacity to resist its impartation” in a highly 
developed state speaks for itself.

SSHOOL Oc APPLCEl lESCGa—aCGHP.
The third annu; 1 Patrons Dinner given by 
the School of Applied Design in honor of Prof. 
Hornbostel at Donegal Inn, West View, last 
Saturday evening was the most successful 
social event of this department in the history of 
the school. The environments were ideal 
for such an affair. And of the fifty that sat at 
the banquet table, there was not one who did 
not enjoy every moment of the evening. There 
were brilliant speeches by each member of the 
faculty and to say they were enthusiastically 
received is expressing the manner of the ap­
plause mildly, in fact Mr. Zeller, who was late 
arriving, declared he heard the locomotive and 
sky rocket yells three miles away. Prof. 
Hornbostel was the recipient of many beautiful 
presents among which was a most striking 
likeness of the “Little Plaid Tie that Horney 
Wore.” But our patron defended himself by 
telling a most interesting history of the plaid 
tie which can be bought in only one place 
in all the world, a small humble hamlet near 
Rome, Italy. About fifteen years ago Prof. 
Hornbostel purchased an installmen of fifty, 
has worn no other kind of tie since and still 
has about fifteen of the original number left, 
by the way he wore a new one for the ocasion. 
The faculty enjoyed themselves immensely 
and there was scarcely a moment of the entire 
evening the pianist was not busy playing some 
one of the popular airs to the accompaniment 
of knife, fork, glasses, etc. Mr. H. M. Laithe 
also sang several beautiful solos. After much 
merriment (which included a bounteous repast 
and some——water) the party disbanded at 
a respectable hour.
“Oh such a headache,” said John Slovinec 
on Sunday about 5.00 p. m., “and where am 
I at.” Through the kindness of some friends 
he found himself in a strange place (but not in 
jail).
Brandy and wine are not fit companions at 
any time to say nothing of patrons dinners.
The fellow who woke up next morning and 
found he had the wrong hat will please return 
it to Oliver.
The committee and students desire to con­
gratulate John England, Jr., on the remarkable 
way he handled the finances of the dinner. 
There was not a cent collected before Satur­
day, and not a bill unpaid after Saturday. 
John should be a financier and not an architect.
Bruton behaved himself admirably at the 
feast and so did King, neither required assist­
ance.

Karl Gloekler was indeed speechless when 
called by Prof. Hornbostel to the head of the 
table on Saturday evening and was then pre­
sented with the first foreign traveling scholar­
ship ever awarded in Pittsburg. Karl, you are 
indeed the most deserving one for so noble a 
prize, and we sincerely congratulate you and 
trust you will come back to us safe in Septem­
ber with many tales of Old Italy and Gay
Paree. In one of his well delivered speeches
Karl, after several minutes, was able to re­
spond and assured Our Patron the money 
would be well spent.
Sorry we can’t all go with you, Karl.

Prof. Crabtree is causing consternation 
among the promoters of the faculty baseball 
team. He is decidedly over-weight and it is 
rumored that he will be unable to hold down 
second base in the same efficient manner as he 
did last season.

TECH WINS ANOTHER.
On Monday the Grove City boys came down 
to play a short game with Tech on the home 
grounds. The game was rather loosely played 
by Tech although she managed to win. Grove 
City played a good game with the exception of 
the man on second who had some fine chances 
which he did not seem to know how to handle. 
Burnside pitched a good steady game as did 
Weigle of Grove City. The Tech outfield put 
up a star game but the infield came near going 
to pieces on some wild throws.
Tech started off with a rush. A three- 
bagger by Caldren and an error by Hartwell 
resulted in a score. In the third, however, 
Grove City evened things. Hartwell reached 
first on a fielder’s choice, stole second and 
advanced to third on a passed ball, and Kings­
ley hit a slashing single to center, scoring 
him. In the fourth Grove City took the lead on 
a single by Marks, who stole second and came 
home on a throw over third by Lytle.
In the closing half of the fifth Harrison, who 
batted for Burnside, struck out. Barclay rais­
ed the spirits by singling to center. Lytle hit 
to Hartwell, who fumbled and then made a 
bad throw to third. Barclay scored and Lytle 
pulled up at third. Lytle was sent home by 
a clever bunt by Caldren.
In the second inning “Red" Kirk electrified 
the spectators by making a sensational pick­
up of a liner from Marks’ bat and throwing 
his man out at first. Lytle in the next inning 
tore off a running catch, which, had he missed
it, would have gone for a home run. The 
score:
