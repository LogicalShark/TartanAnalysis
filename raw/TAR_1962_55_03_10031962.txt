Fall Festival Queen
e Campus Prepares For
cw
‘ét
r0 ATTENTION, FRESHMEN WOMEN!
As is the custom at Carnegie Tech, a queen and court 
of honor shall be chosen to reign over the Fall Festival 
Weekend, which is to be held on October 26 and 27. These 
I 1 three girls are always chosen from among the members of 
the freshman class and are elected by the male student body. 
Election to this honor is one of the highest tributes a fresh- 
--------------------------------------------------?man woman can receive.
Tech Ceilidh 
Convenes Fori .., \ -- ~ O-OO<
i *Second Year
The Carnegie Ceilidh will begin 
its second year of Friday night 
folk music sessions in the Wher- 
rett Room, Ekibo, at eight o’clock 
on the evening of October 5. The 
Ceilidh is an organization of stu- 
^ dents, faculty, and anyone else 
who enjoys making, sharing,- or 
simply listening to folk music. It 
is a distinctly informal group, and 
its membership includes whoever 
happens to be there at any given 
time. (A constitution exists, but 
its contents are known only to 
Professor Howard Glasser of the1 
Graphic Arts Department — the
0 Ceilidh’s founder and faculty ad­
visor — and whatever members of 
the student government concern 
themselves with such affairs.) 
Anyone with an interest, however 
passive, in folk music is warmly 
invited to attend, and those who 
wish to exercise voices, guitars, 
mandolins, banjoes, bouzoukis, or 
balalaikas are especially welcome, 
i It is hoped that this year, as last, 
those members of the Tech com­
munity from foreign countries will 
be kind enough to share their 
music with us.
Among the activities of last year 
which the Ceilidh hopes to con­
tinue and if possible expand are 
a madrigal group and even the 
bare beginnings of a recorder con- 
^ sort. Last spring a very successful 
concert was given under Ceilidh 
auspices by Arthur Argo, a visit­
ing Scottish folk singer and col­
lector; a similar event is envis­
ioned for the latter part of this 
year.
Ceilidh is a Gaelic word stand­
ing for a gathering at which 
everyone sings, plays, dances, or 
recites. In this spirit the Carnegie 
Ceilidh hopes to carry on as faith­
fully as it did last year.
Any freshman girl at Tech is 
eligible for this honor. The pro­
cedure for nominations and elec­
tions is as follows: On Friday, 
October 5, at 4:30 p.m. in the 
Wherrett Lounge of Skibo, all 
freshman women are requested 
to attend an assembly for the 
purpose of nominating queen can­
didates. Any freshman girls may 
nominate or be nominated, but 
must be present at this assembly 
to do so.
A total of fifteen girls will be 
nominated. The freshman girls 
present at the assembly will then 
vote to limit the number of nom­
inees to seven, and these seven 
will then be the candidates «a 
whom the male population later 
votes.
Freshman women who desire 
further information about this 
procedure may contact the chair­
man of the Fall Festival Queen 
Committee, Peggy Riva or her co- 
ehairman, Arlene Winner.
Seniors Sign 
For Pictures
;N Seniors can make appointments 
for their yearbook pictures begin­
ning October 4, in Skibo lobby.
The photographer will be avail­
able for three weeks, October 15 
to November 2, during the follow­
ing hours: Monday and Tuesday,
12 p.m. to 9 p.m.; Wednesday, 
Thursday, and Friday, 10 ajm. to 
6 p.m. The waiting period defi­
nitely will not exceed five 
minutes.
Each senior must be on time for 
his appointment. If for a valid 
reason he is unable to keep his 
appointment, he can make an al­
ternate arrangement with the 
photographer in Room 46, Skibo.
Appointments can be made with 
members of the 1963 Thistle staff 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 
from 8:15 to 11:30 a.m. in Admin­
istration Hall, and 11:30 a.m. to 
1:30 p.m. in Skibo cafeteria (lower 
floor); Tuesdays and Thursdays 
the staff members will be in Skibo 
lobby from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Fra­
ternity and sorority members 
should make appointments with 
their organizations as in the past.
The total cost of the yearbook 
picture is $2.00 for seniors and 
$3.50 for fraternity and sorority 
members. Conservative dress is 
recommended: white shirt and
solid-colored tie and jacket for 
men; blouse, sweater, or dress in 
a solid color for women.
The Thistle staff urges all sen­
iors to sign up for these pictures 
so that the entire graduating class 
can be included in the yearbook.
Linden Falls For Progress

10:30 a.m. classes on Wednesday, 
October 17, will terminate at 11:10 
a.m. and there will be no 11:30 
a.m. classes.
It is hoped that as many stu­
dents as possible will take advant­
age of this opportunity to partici­
pate in the dedication ceremony.
Tech Receives Grants; 
Research Continues
Tech has received $319,000 in 
grants over the last three months.
The Buhl Foundation of Pitts­
burgh has given a grant of $150,-
000 to finance the first three of a 
series of International Conference 
on Materials. These conferences 
will be held in Pittsburgh in alter­
nate years, the first in 1963. The 
announcement was made by A. W. 
Robertson, president of the Found­
ation.
Tech has also received three re­
search contracts totaling over 
$55,000 from the National Science 
Foundation and the National In­
stitute of Health. The two grants 
from the N.S.F. went to Simeon 
A. Friedberg, associate professor 
of physics, who will conduct a 
study of “Low Temperature Mag­
netic Measurements of Hydrated 
Salts of Metals,” and Alan J. Perl- 
is, director of the computation 
center and head of the department 
of mathematics, for support for an 
“Advanced Subject-Matter Insti­
tute of Computer Training.”

tivities in the sciences.
Activities 
File Forms
The Activities Committee of 
Student Congress is in the process 
of distributing to the president or 
chairman of each campus organi­
zation an activities recognition 
form. The purpose of this form 
which is due October, 9, is to 
bring Student Congress records up 
to date. Only if this form is com­
pleted, can groups use Carnegie 
Tech facilities and receive official 
recognition from Student Con­
gress.
The heads of all campus or­
ganizations are strongly urged to 
request this recognition form if 
they have not received one by 
October 5. They can be obtained 
from Ellie Wiseman, chairman of 
the Activities Committee. In ad­
dition, groups who wish to re­
ceive probationary status from 
Student Congress should also fill 
out a form.
Christians

“Scripture and Sex” will be the 
theme of the Western Pennsyl­
vania College Christian Confer­
ence to be held October 12-14 at 
Camp Lutherlyn, near Butler. The 
Conference will feature a dialogue 
between Dr. Aumhau Wolf, a 
Toledo, Ohio, clergyman, pastor of 
a large Lutheran Church, and 
formerly a member of the Luth­
eran Theological Seminary in 
Maywood, Illinois, and Dr. Albert 
Ellis, who has been in the private

Campus Personality
John Bertucci, CFP President, 
Explains Organization’s Goals
With fraternity rush just over, 
it will perhaps be helpful to ac­
quaint new and potential pledges, 
and the campus in general, with 
the functions of the Council of 
Fraternity Presidents. This is at­
tempted with the help of John 
Bertucci, President of CFP and 
this week’s CAMPUS PERSON­
ALITY.
John is a senior metallurgy ma­
jor from New Castle, Pa.
His other activities include Al­
pha Tau Omega fraternity in 
which he has served as Social 
Chairman, Assistant House Man­
ager, Vice-President and CFP 
representative; Chairman of the 
1960 Homecoming Queen Com­
mittee; 1962 Freshman Camp 
Counsellor; Treasurer of the 
Metals Club; and student mem­
ber of AIME.
With all this John has kept a 
factor high enough to continue a 
four year U. S. Steel Scholar­
ship.
In keeping with his field, John 
was awarded a 1961 NSF Under­
graduate Research Grant in 
Metallurgy. In the summer of 
1962 he was employed in re­
search at Youngstown Sheet and 
Tube. Both gave good prepara­
tion for John’s immediate plans 
of attending graduate school.
With regards to CFP and its 
functions on the CIT campus, 
John says, “CFP was officially 
recognized by CIT on March 5, 
1921. Membership consists of the 
twelve social fraternities. The fra­
ternity president and one other 
representative from each of the 
12 fraternities make up the coun­
cil. It is the purpose of the coun­
cil to decide upon questions con­
cerning scholastic, athletic, finan­
cial and other fraternity and in­
ter-fraternity activities; the re­
lations between the fraternity 
system and CIT, CIT student

Great new record offer from

body, and campus and general 
public; rules for rushing, pledg­
ing, and initiation; assisting mem­
ber fraternities to become strong­
er fraternities.”
“The fraternities realize the 
great potential they have for the 
development of members into 
mature, responsible men. They 
endeavor, through CFP, to for­
mulate system-wide policies 
which will help them achieve 
their goals as defined in the Na­
tional Interfraternity Conference 
Decolog. For example, the pledge 
scholarship program is aimed at 
helping freshmen pledges adjust 
toi college academics. The fra­
ternities feel it is their respon­
sibility to help their pledges 
make this adjustment.”
In the past CFP has also been 
active in service projects such as 
the United Fund drive and the 
Books for the Aged drive.
Renovation of existing facili­
ties and purchase of new equip­
ment and facilities amounting to 
almost $200,000 began this June 
in the department of graphic arts.
Kenneth G. Scheid, head of the 
department of graphic arts, states, 
“I am hopeful that the ¦authoriza­
tion of this substantial investment 
in graphic arts by Carnegie Tech 
will put to rest the erroneous 
notion that Carnegie Tech no 
longer is offering a technical 
program in management educa­
tion for the graphic arts.”
Five new printing engineering 
laboratories, the first of their 
kind anywhere in graphic arts 
education, are being built for the 
management program. They in­
clude a photographic science his­
tory, a photomechanical labora­
tory, a light and color analysis 
laboratory, a printability and 
press systems laboratory, and a 
paper and ink laboratory. Equip­
ment includes scientific instru­
ments, chemical benches, special 
light sources, and many testing 
devices, as well as cameras, dark 
rooms, plate making units and 
presses to be used for the sci­
entific study of processes and ma­
terials.
Design facilities include a spe­
cially - lighted advertising and 
package design studio, a graphic 
design work room, a typographic 
and book design studio, a pho­
tographic studio and nine dark 
roims, a graphic reproduction 
studio, a machine composition 
service shop, and a graphic arts 
display gallery. Also included is 
the New Laboratory Press, which 
is a special facility for instruc­
tion in fine typographic design 
and printing.
According to Mr. Scheid, the 
technical facilities are part of 
Carnegie Tech’s aim in graphic 
arts management education which 
is “to make the study of print­
ing a field of engineering offer­
ing the printing industry much 
wider use of the resources in en-
gineering and science available 
at Carnegie Tech.” He also noted 
that advanced business studies 
constitute an equal part of the 
new four-year program.
A new course in the Theory 
of Computation has been adopt­
ed in recognition of the impor­
tance of high-speed data process­
ing in graphic arts operations. 
Applications of computers in such 
areas as production control, in­
ventory control, etc., and expand­
ed use of computers in automa­
tion of typesetting systems and 
control of printing operations are 
forseen in the near future.

WHAT TO WEAR TILL THE DOCTOR COMES
Now that you have enrolled and paid your fees and bought 
your books and found your way around campus and learned to 
hate your roommate, it is time to turn to the most important 
aspect of college life. I refer, of course, to clothes.
What does Dame Fashion decree for the coming school year? 
(Incidentally, Dame Fashion is not, as many people believe, a 
fictitious character. She was a real Englishwoman who lived in 
Elizabethan times and, indeed, England is forever in her debt. 
During the invasion of the Spanish Armada, Dame Fashion— 
not yet a Dame but a mere, unlettered country lass named 
Moll Flanders—during the invasion, I say, of the Spanish 
Armada, this dauntless girl stood on the white cliffs of Dover 
and turned the tide of battle by rallying the drooping morale of 
the British fleet with this stirring poem of her own corapositiom
Don't be gutless,
Men of Britain.
Swing your cutlass,
We ain’t quittin’.
Smash the Spanish,
Sink their boats,
Make ’em vanish,
Like a horse makes oats.
For Good Queen Bess,
Dear sirs, you gotta 
Make. a mess 
Of that Armada.
You won’t fail!
Knock ’em,flat!
Then we’ll drink ale 
.. And stuff like that.
As a reward for these inspirational verses Queen Elizabeth 
dubbed her a Dame, made her Poet Laureate, and gave her 
the Western Hemisphere except Duluth. But this was not the 
extent of Dame Fashion’s service to Queen and country. In 
1589 she invented the laying hen, and she was awarded a life­
time pass to Chavez Ravine. But she was not to end her days 
in glory. In 1591, alas, she was arrested for overtime jousting 
and imprisoned for thirty years in a butt of malmsey. This later 
became known as Guy Fawkes Day.)
But I digress. Let us get back to campus fashions. Certain to 
be the rage again this year is the cardigan (which, curiously 
enough, was named after Lord Cardigan, who commanded the 
English fleet against the Spanish Armada. The sweater is only 
one product of this remarkable Briton’s imagination. He also 
invented the glottal stop, the gerund, and the eyelid, without 
which winking, as we know it today, would not be possible).
But I digress. The cardigan, I say, will be back, which is, I 
believe, cause for rejoicing. Why? Because the cardigan ha« 
nice big pockets in which to carry your Marlboro Cigarettes— 
and that, good friends, is ample reason for celebration as all ot 
you will agree who have enjoyed Marlboro’s fine, comfortable, 
mellow flavor and Marlboro’s filter. So why don’t you slip into 
your cardigan and hie yourself to your tobacconist for soma 
good Marlboros? They come in soft pack or flip-top box. Cardi­
gans come in pink for girls and blue for boys. a ims m„ aw«*» 
? * *
Cardigans or pullovers—it’s a matter of taste ! ! ! And so I* 
Marlboro a matter of taste—the best taste that can possible 
be achieved by experienced growers and blender»—by 
tnce, diligence, and tender loving car9. Try a pack.

CURTAIN GOING UP! Candle Confuse
Greetings
By Christopher Allen
Since it is that time of year when everyone on campus is giving 
out hearty welcomes to freshmen, and upperclassmen who have had 
the stamina to return, I shall add my small voice: Greetings to all, 
especially to those who are still fairly pecunious, even after the 
expenses for books, tuition, etc., and can afford the relatively high 
price of The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm, at the 
Warner. If you have the scratch, by all means go see it.
This flick is one of those super-spectaculars designed for chil­
dren that, like Peter Pan, backfire and become adult fare as well. 
It is a fun-filled fantasy for the youngsters (of all ages) and a well 
made, and thoroughly enjoyable, biography-drama that is sometimes 
beyond the scope of the fairy-tale set, for their elders. To anyone 
who has ever read Snow White, or Cinderella, it is a most pleasant 
return to the carefree days that are now gone. And if you try really 
hard, you can, for a little while, experience the same type of feeling 
that Wilhelm Grimm had as he transcribed these timeless master­
pieces. Besides the whole bloomin’ thing is in Cinerama, a chancy, 
but exciting medium, if you can abide its minor flaws.
Like another great picture of the past, the cast is loaded with 
stars, some deserving of their titles as such. Karl Boehrr as Jacob 
Grimm is excellent, and Barbara Eden as his would-be wife 
makes a fine complement. Walter Slezak, the venerable master of 
quiet, homey comedy, once again proves his worth in the role of 
the bookseller-friend to the Grimms, and Clair Bloom makes a lovely 
wife for Wilhelm. But this is only the biographical part of the film. 
In one the episodes, Russ Tamblin becomes the epitome of the 
handsome suitor for the equally perfect princess, Yvette Mimieux. In 
another of the episodes, Terry Thomas and Buddy Hackett do wonders 
to make the ancient block print words come to life. Add a dash of 
George Paul’s Puppetoons, and a liberal sprinkling of Robert Merrill’s 
music and lyrics, and the whole work is almost complete.
The task of completing the whole feeling of the film falls to 
the recognition of Laurence Harvey, as Wilhelm Grimm, and 
Laurence Harvey as the Cobbler, in the Cobbler and the Elves 
episode. That Mr. Harvey is one of the most talented actors in 
cinema today is nothing new to those who saw him in Room at the 
Top. But the fantastic range of roles he poses is most clearly evi­
denced here in The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm. On 
the one hand he plays the crusading author, fighting to maintain 
the joys of children all over the world, and on the other hand he 
plays the delightful, decrepit, and charming Cobbler. The transform­
ation is so complete that it is hard to believe the programme, even 
when it tells us that it is the same man playing both parts. I know 
not which technique of acting Mr. Harvey uses, but it is unquestion­
ably successful for him. And I think that the entire film is success­
ful, due in no small way to Mr. Harvey.
New Outlook 
The Complacent American
By STEPHEN T. MILLER
Generations of Americans have been stirred by the concluding 
words of Lincoln's Gettyburg Address; “ . . . that government of 
the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish 
from the earth.” Truly the American ideal.
Looking at the political scene of today can we truthfully say 
that Lincoln’s statement is still true? Each November we troop to 
the polls and elect representatives to some level of government or 
other. We vote for our mayer because he is a personal friend, for 
our governor because he comes from our home town, for our 
senator because he shook our hand, and for our President because 
he is handsome. This is reflected by the candidates themselves in 
the emphasis they place upon being a regular guy and not taking a 
stance on any controversial issues. Party platforms, when presented, 
are seldom if ever upheld. A senatorial candidate when questioned 
about this stated “The American people don’t have time to worry 
about that sort of thing.”
Unfortunately this is true. The American people won’t be both­
ered. The majority of them have everything they need and most 
of what they want. They are happy and perfectly content. Why 
should they stir themselves to anything as unpleasant as making 
an intelligent choice. It requires little time and effort but is still 
too much of a sacrifice for us to make.
This decision making is symptomatic Qf a much larger prob­
lem: the resistance to making a sacrifice of some individual attain­
ment for the good of all. This nation was built upon sacrifice and 
rests upon it. Lincoln stated it very aptly. He emphasized govern­
ment of the people and by the people as strongly as for the people. 
This is what Kennedy has been calling for. This is what we must
offer our time, our ener- 
;s for our country, 
iber a few of our basic 
lisplayed but it must be
W
if nee$
be willing to give f 
gies, our thoughts,
This is a small loss when we rem 
beliefs. Patriotism may not be publicly 
personally cherished. The individual must never become so com­
placent that he forgets his heritage and the basic truth that only a 
democracy permits individualism. To have his rights he must satisfy 
his obligations; otherwise he loses everything.
Or Enlighten?
Editor, The Tartan:
These words are prompted by 
Mr. Axelrad’s spirited if unsound 
defense of the principle behind 
restricted fraternities.
His argument apparently is 
based on the distinction made be­
tween “the public scene” where, 
admittedly, “every individual has 
the right to be treated equally 
with every other citizen,” and a 
private group of persons having 
“the right to join in an organiza­
tion (fraternity) and exclude any 
groups (Negroes and Jews) they 
feel like excluding.” Anyone who 
objects, contends the writer, “can 
simply ignore the organization or 
protest vcally.” Now I think that 
Mr. Axelrad has errored seriously 
in designating a college fraternity 
as a typically private organization.
I think he has ignored the fact 
that a school (Carnegie Tech) is 
the sum of all its component parts 
(including fraternities). Fraterni­
ties cannot be viewed as “private 
organizations” since their very 
existence depends upon the school 
of which they are a part. The 
school is the fraternity’s reason 
for being; the local auspices, de­
livered by its administration, and 
continually nurtured by its re­
sources. Indeed, if there were no 
school there could be no fraterni­
ties, although, happily, the con­
verse is not necessarily true. 
(That the> are, in fact, dependent 
upon the school becomes all the 
more apparent when it is realized 
that eleven of the twelve frater­
nity houses are owned by Tech, 
not to mention the varied school 
fraternities, at least from the 
point of view of principle. If Car­
negie Tech avows the idea that 
the admission, evaluation, and 
graduation of its students is con­
tingent up^n their ability, rather 
than upon their color or creed, 
then it is logical to assume that 
fraternities, as parts of the school, 
ought to adopt similar practices.
Mr. Axelrad and the restricted 
fraternities should have the cour­
age of their convictions. If they 
can in no way reconcile them­
selves with the underlying demo­
cratic principle governing Car­
negie Tech procedures — a prin­
ciple willingly accepted by the 
great majority of students and 
faculty — then members ought, 
at most, fully to disassociate their 
organizations from the school or, 
at least, cease using facilities 
made available to them by an in­
stitution professing .an ideal in 
flagrant contradiction to their 
own.
In addition and from another 
viewpoint, if the Institute is in­
deed the reflection of that which 
comprises it then those practices 
and activities considered by most 
as distasteful can serve only to 
jeopardize, in the opinion of most, 
the good name of the school. 
Many students no doubt regret 
that fifty percent of the fraterni­
ties on their campus are, in one 
way or another, restricted.
The point, if I may stress it, i^

I am deeply indebted to Richard Cary for the above verse and 
title. He expresses far better than I can the “absurity” of life with­
out motives — or if not without motives, without thought. Any.'' 
person must spend the major part of his life attending to details. The 
folly comes when he mistakes these details for the “purpose” of life.
Of course some individuals get pleasure out of a fixed daily exist­
ence. These should follow their set patterns for it is the happiest 
way of life for them — and if life has a purpose for any person, it 
is not inconsistent with being religious; a person who is truly re­
ligious is joyful while meditating on his God (or Gods).
However, the person who pays lip-service to the other events 
in life — a slow wTalk downtown, a sunny day, a baby fern, or even 
events such as a capable man in public office (a rare event), a better 
way to build a structure, etc. — is in many cases deluding himself. It 
is fashionable to think of yourself as “sophisticated,” and one 
measure of “sophistication” seems to be a lip-service to the ideals 
which oppose this in the above verse. Unfortunately, just as many 
people read books so they can say they have read them, many more 
pretend to do the things which make a person look “sophisticated” 
without actually doing or thinking of the event for itself.
Take a political example: In some groups it is accepted that 
liberals (or conservatives, Democrats or Republicans) are always 
right, and that any civic-minded individual should be one. So the 
status-seeking individual joins the group which will most impress 
his friends. He neither thinks whether the aims and philosophy of J 
the group agree with his nor cares. His thinking is simply changed 
to meet the approval of the group. This is particularly true of liberals 
today. In the ’20’s and ’30’s people joined the liberal movement be­
cause they felt that was the best way to improve society. Today 
people join because others join. There is good reason for this. 
Previously people started calling themselves liberals because it 
sounded impressive. The liberals of today are blindly following the 
liberal creed as it existed in the ’20’s. This is a most unfortunate 
circumstance, for the liberal movement was a great force for “good” 
in the world, and while it may still occasionally bring forth new ^ 
ideas, it is hampered in progressing by willfully ignorant people ' 
who have no real desire to have themselves considered “different.” 
And a liberal — at least one who presents or advocates fresh ideas — 
must be different for a time. The best hope for a resurrected liberal 
movement is to make the present liberals wake up to what they 
are doing. In fact most people would benefit if they examined their 
thoughts and actions. It’s a healthy suggestion.

With apologies to Frank Kafka:
As Gregor Tech awoke one 
morning from uneasy dreams, he 
found himself transformed in his 
bed into a gigantic insect. He
^ wondered what had happened to 
him — surely this was no dream.' 
He found it useless to try and 
move about; his awkward and ex- ! 
hausting attempts to follow his1 
usual schedule proved futile. His j 
roommates and even his open-1 
minded professors (who professed 
that nothing could suprise them, 
but who were obviously surprised) 
shunned poor Gregor. No one was
* willing to bring him food, let 
alone companionship, and it was 
useless for him to attempt to get 
anything for himself.
Gregor was indeed doomed — 
to seclusion and eventually to 
starvation !
But did this bother our bug?
No indeed!
r He consoled himself by rolling
* over or his hard shelled back, 
escaping into the wonderful world 
of “Patterns.”
“It’s easy to stop smoking. I’ve 
done it a dozen times,” said Mark 
Twain. Today, 60 million Amer­
icans consume approximately 470 
billion cigarettes yearly — or 
about 21 cigarettes each day.
The U.S. Public Health Service 
believes that present evidence im­
plicates smoking as the principal 
factor in the increased incidence 
of lung cancer, and Great Britain’s 
Minister of Health has said in an 
official statement that there is sta­
tistically an “incontrovertible as­
sociation” between smoking and 
lung cancer. Others disagree. And 
the public is still puffing.
Bell Laboratories’ Medical De­
partment has interested itself in 
the question because of two 
known facts: The significant in­
crease in the lung cancer death 
rate, and the low survival or cure 
rate for lung cancer victims.
Lung cancer, like a deadly 
rocket, has shot to the top as the 
No. 1 malignancy in men in the 
U.S. Last year, an estimated 30,- 
800 men and 4,000 women suc­
cumbed to this killer, an increase 
of 29,000 over the total lung can­
cer death rate just two decades 
ago.
Already, 10 known cancer pro­
ducing agents have been found in 
tobacco smoke.
Even though atmospheric pollu­
tion from domestic and factory 
chimneys, automobile exhaust 
fumes, dust from tarred roads and 
rubber tires, etc., may contribute 
to lung cancer, most medical re- : 
search points to smoking — espe-! 
cially 25 or more cigarettes daily. 
— as the principal cause.
And Medical people also have 
indicated that liability to lung 
cancer is abou 60 times greater 
among two-pack-a-day smokers 
than non-smokers.
Smoking also has been reported 
to cause damage in the respira­
tory. heart and circulatory sys­
tems; in point, coronary heart 
disease is far- more common in 
smokers.
Finally, no method of treating 
tobacco or filtering the smoke has 
been demonstrated to be effective 
in materially reducing or elimin­
ating the hazards of lung cancer. 
Claims that tobacco is its own best 
filter are misleading.
Meanwhile, the human race re­
mains divided on one of the most 
controversial of medical subjects.
Beginning Thursday, October 4, 
Mr. Earl Birdy, Assistant Pro- 
| fessor of the Carnegie Tech Phy­
sical Education Department, will 
be the host of a new sports shaw 
| to be aired on Carnegie Radio,
I WRCT. The show, A Busload of 
Sports, sponsored by DeBolt and 
Somerset Bus Lines, will be heard 
every Thursday throughout the 
year at 7:15 p.m. Mr. Birdy will 
feature complete coverage of all 
Carnegie Tech athletic news, in­
cluding intramurals, varsity 
sports, and the Women’s Athletic 
Association. As an added feature, 
a prominent guest will acompany 
Mr. Birdy on each show. WRCT 
feels that this show is something 
which the campus has needed for 
a long time and is proud to have 
Mr. Birdy as a part of its ex­
pending news staff.
Mr. Birdy has been a well- 
known sports figure in this area 
since coming to Tech in 1951. He 
is a graduate of Slippery Rock 
and holds a masters degree in ed­
ucation from the University of 
Pittsburgh. He is presently an 
official for football, basketball, 
and volleyball competition in 
Pennsylvania, and is one of the 
best informed athletic officials in 
this area. His new show will 
prove to be worthwhile listening 
for all who are interested in 
sporting news. It begins tomorrow 
and will be heard every Thurs­
day evening this year at 7:15 on 
WRCT, 900 on your dial.

EE and Chemistry Departments ¦ Poetry Contest Hoover Receives Honorarium, 
Open to Tech Reward For Meritous TeachingInitiate Changes In Facxdtv
Both the EE and Chemistry De- ' 
partments of E&S college have 
changes in their faculty this fall. 
Dr. Richard L. Longini has been 
appointed a professor of solid- 
state electronics in the Electrical 
Engineering Department and to 
the staff of the metals research 
laboratory at Tech.
Dr. Longini earned a B.S. de­
gree at the University of Chicago 
and an M.S. and Ph.D. at the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh.
He has been in industrial re­
search since 1934. working in 
many branches of applied non-nu­
clear physics. His principal work 
has been in the development of 
electronic devices, including a 
snooperscope-tvpe image tube, an 
x-ray thickness guage, and an x- 
ray image intersifter, as well as all 
types of semiconductor devices.
Dr. Longini is the author or co­
author of some 16 technical ar­
ticles; he has been issued more
Sanitary Engs.
Plan To Develope 
Computer Cotie
The attainment of a large de­
gree at automation in the field 
of sanitary engineering desijn and 
analysis will be the object of a 
fiv i-year research study to begin 
this fall at Carnegie Tech.
Dr. George Bugliarello. as­
sistant professor of civil engin­
eering and director of the pro­
ject, hopes to achieve this goal 
through the development of a 
synthetic computer language for 
sanitary engineering. The re­
search study is being sponsored 
by a $111.000 grant to Tech from 
the United States Public Health 
Service.
The language to be developed 
here will be content oriented — 
that is, designed for the specific 
field of sanitary engineering— 
rather than a general purpose oae 
as most computer languages are 
today. Instructions imparted to 
the computer in the proposed 
language will be very similar to 
those given to today’s engineering 
staff. Thus an engineer with lit- | 
tie or no previous training in 
programming with today’s general P 
purpose languagaes should he 
able to learn to communicate ef- j 
fectively with the computer in 
a very short time. The engineer I 
who is skilled in programming 
with general purpose languages i 
should also benefit from the new 
language because it should make j 
it possible for him to perform • 
very complex computer analysis j 
with considerably greater sim- \ 
plicity than is possible today.
For the five years of the pro­
ject. the study will be limited to [ 
the area of hydrology, which will j 
serve as a pilot “area” for *he 
subsequent extension to other 
areas of sanitary engineering and 
water resources.
In the development of such a 
language the sanitary engineer 
mush work closely with a com­
puter specialist. For this purpose. 
Dr. Allen Newell, institute profes­
sor of systems and communiea- ! 
tion sciences at Carnegie Tech 
and one of the foremost experts I 
on computers in the United States, 
will advise on the subject.
Ultimately, the full develop- 1 
ment of the language should lead 
to the elimination of a large num- j 
ber of the intermediate steps oc- 
curing today between the collec­
tion of field data and the final 
analysis or design. This would 
give a very powerful “leverage” 
to the engineer, placing him in 
what could be termed a “profes­
sional symbiosis” with the com­
puter.
Such a development should be 
an effective step toward alleviat­
ing the chronic and ever increas­
ing shortage of sanitary and 
water resources engineers by ^n- 
arger number of them 
rate their activity on 
ative rather than con-
than 35 U.S. patents as well as 
many foreign ones, and has filed 
more than 160 patent disclosures. I
In the Chemistry Department, j 
Julian Paul Shedlovskv has" been 
appointed assistant professor.
He will assume Professor T. P. 
Kohman’s teaching obligations 
while the latter is away on faculty 
leave during the academic year, 
1962-63.
A native of New York City, Dr. 1 
Shedlovsky received his A. B. de- , 
gree from Columbia College and 
his Ph.D. from Princeton Univer­
sity. He has been a post-doctoral 
research chemist at Carnegie Tech 
since 1960 and prior to that a 
research chemist with Gulf Re­
search and Developmenta Com­
pany.
Professor David S. McKinney 
has been appointed Associate 
Head of the Department of Chem- '
istry.
A native of Atwood. Pa., Pro­
fessor McKinney received his B.S. 
degree in chemical engineering 
and his D.Sc. in physical chemis- 
try from Carnegie Tech. He serv­
ed here as a part-time instructor 
from 1928 to 1931 and joined the 
faculty as a full time instructor in 
1936. Since 1951 he has been a 
professor of chemistry.

Reflections of Telstar
Remember the picture above? It flashed across your 
television screen on a hot night last July. Perhaps 
you remember that it originated from France. And 
that it reached the U. S. via Telstar, the world’s first 
private enterprise communications satellite.
Since that summer night, the Bell System’s Telstar 
has relayed electronic signals of many types-tele­
vision broadcasts, telephone calls, news photographs, 
and others.
But there’s one Telstar reflection you might have 
missed. Look into the faces of the Bell System people 
below and you’ll see it. It is the reflection of Telstar’s
success that glowed brightly on the faces of all who 
shared in the project.
Their engineering, administrative and operations 
skills created Telstar and are bringing its benefits 
down out of the clouds to your living room.
These Bell System people, through their talented, 
dedicated efforts, make your phone service still better, 
more economical, and more useful.
The reflections of Telstar are many.

Fine Arts Appoints Corrigan, Theta Xi Merges With KSK; 
Goldman Ne w Department Head Chapters Retain TX Traditions
Dr. J. C. Warner, Las announced 
the appointments of two new de­
partment heads in the College of 
Fine Arts.»Professor Robert W. Corrigan, 
head of the department of drama, 
and Professor Lee Goldman, head 
of the department of painting, de­
sign, and sculpture, have assumed 
their new positions.
The national officeres of Theta 
Xi and Kappa Sigma Kappa fra­
ternities signed a merger agree­
ment on August 20, 1962, after 
Kappa Sigma Kappa’s House of 
Delegates unamimously approved 
the agreement at their conven­
tion in Detroit. The chapters of 
Theta Xi had earlier authorized
their Grand Lodge to enter into 
the agreement.
The newly combined Fraternity 
preserved the name and madge 
of Theta Xi Fraternity, which 
was founded in 1864 at Rensse­
laer Polytechnic Institute in Tr^y, 
New York. The pledge pin, name 
of the manual (The Quest), and
fllower, were brought into the 
Fraternity from Kappa Sigma 
Kappa, which was founded at the 
Virginia Military Institute in 1867 
and reorganized at the Univer­
sity of Virginia in 1935.
“The merger of our group with 
Kappa Sigma Kappa is a signifi­
cant step forward, both for our 
combined fraternities, this chap­
ter, and the fraternity system at 
Carnegie Institute,” said Gordon 
E. Pike, chapter president. “We’re 
proud to be affiliated with the 
other 67 chapters of Theta Xi 
Fraternity.”
Professor Corrigan came to 
Tech in September, 1961. Recent­
ly he was named Andrew Mellon 
Professor of Drama, and he will 
continue to fill that distinguished 
">chair.
A nationally known educator, 
lecturer, and writer, and editor of 
the Tulane Drama Review, Pro­
fessor Corrigan received his A.B. 
degree from Cornell University, 
his M.A. from Johns Hopkins Uni­
versity, and his Ph.D. from the 
University of Minnesota. He has 
directed over 35 plays in univer­
sity and summer theatres and has 
j-s published articles in leading edu- 
• cation and theatre journals 
throughout the country.
Professor Corrigan succeeds 
Professor Theodore Hoffman, who * . 7 has resigned from his administra­
tive duties after having served as 
head of the department of drama 
since 1958.
Professor Goldman, a native of 
Pittsburgh, received his B.F.A. de- 
gree from Tech and later studied 
at Randolph-Macon College and 
the University of Tampa. He suc­
ceeds, in his departmental duties, 
Professor Norman L. Rice, dean 
of the College of Fine Arts, who 
has also been head of the depart­
ment of painting, design, and 
sculpture for the past seven years.

The Carnegie Tech varsity 
rifle team attained the goal of all 
Tech teams last Saturday, Sep­
tember 29. In a practice meet held 
on the Tech range, the Tartan 
shooters defeated Pitt, 1370 to 
1356.
High man in the meet was Tech 
sophomore Mike Ray, who shot a 
281 out of a possible 300. Sec­
ond high man in the meet was 
Pitt’s Schwiensberg with a 279.
Only two of the Tech shooters 
were lettermen from past years. 
They were junior Joe Schlitt and 
Ray. The other eight places on 
the Tech team were filled by two 
juniors and six freshmen.
With only two lettermen out 
for the team, all students who 
are interested are asked to try 
out for the team. Both male and 
female students are allowed to 
shoot. Anyone who wishes to ob­
tain information may call S.^t. 
Dobrzykowski at Ext. 409 or 
speak w’ith him on the rifle range 
in the sub-basement of MMCC. 
Tryouts will be conducted

The regular rifle season will

when Tech takes cm Duquesne, 
Pitt, and West Virginia Univer­

Stiff competition is expected from 
the WVU shooters who were 
ranked among the top five rifle 
teams in the country last year.
IM FOOTBALL SQUADS DRILL AS SEASON NEARS; 
GRAD EAGLES TO TRY FOR CHAMPIONSHIP REPEAT
Another IM football season is 
getting under way with over a 
score of teams going after the IM 
championship trophy. All the 
squads have turned in their ros­
ters and changes to the Intra­
mural Board and have been prac­
ticing for nearly two weeks.
Last year’s winners, the Grad 
Eagles, have to be given the nod 
to keep their championship for 
another year. Quarterback Bob 
Murphy, last year’s MVP, and all­
school Fred Kosofsky are expect­
ed to be the two key players in the 
Eagles’ lineup.
Delta Upsilon, with quarterback 
Jerry Kosko and end John Pavlac, 
should make plenty of trouble for 
the Eagles and everyone else con­
cerned.
Tau Delta Phi, led by John 
Borofsky and QB Mike Yablon 
should finish in the thick of it as 
should Sigma Nu, a strong threat 
to take it all.
Phi Kappa Theta could prove to 
be a sleeper as could Beta Theta 
Pi and ATO. A good pledge clasi 3 
in these or any other house could 
supply just the punch needed to 
take the cup from the Eagles.
On Friday, October 26, the 
Eagles will get all the opposition 
they can handle when they take 
on an all-star team made up from 
the other IM squads in a game 
that should provide plenty of ex­
citement for all.
