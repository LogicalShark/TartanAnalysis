Carnegie’s Traditional Carnival 
Coming Weekend of March 25
Soph Hop Considered 
One of the Best 
Dances of Semester
On Saturday night last, the Ex­
hibition Room of Chez Artes was 
graced by one of the nicest affairs 
in quite some little time. The Soph 
Hop, annual gathering of the Cwens, 
held merry sway.
The crowd was impressive, both 
numerically and intellectually; the 
band of Bill LeRoy surprised one 
and all by behaving in a manner be­
fitting a top-flight name; the drinks 
were Coca and Cola.
Present were Mrs. Jessie Yon, As­
sistant Dean (of Women), Assistant 
Dean (of Men) Murphy and Mrs. 
Murphy, Mrs. Cranna of the 
Secretarial Department, and Miss 
Hays, sponsors of the Cwens. 
Among the clientele were to be 
found such typical uniforms of the 
Armed Forces as those of the Army, 
Navy, and Marines. Representation 
was made for every Fraternity and 
Sorority, and for every course, in­
cluding Drama.
Conversation was inane, as usual, 
including such tidbits as “Joe, meet 
Ann; Ann, meet Joe.” The band 
came up with some sparkling 
rhythm—evidenced in such pieces 
as Begin the Beguine, Besame 
Mucho, Holiday for Strings, One 
o’Clock Jump, etc., etc., ad infinitum.
The weather was wet.
Tech’s Last Drive; 
—We Need You!
The last Carnegie Tech blood 
donor drive of this semester is being 
planned and it needs no greater 
spur than the words of a prominent 
Red Cross executive, Dr. Donald E. 
Hagaman, who is new with the 
American Red Cross in Sicily and 
Italy:
‘T was in Italy, not too far from 
the forward area, and wanted to fly 
back to Sicily and found that I 
could fly back in a hospital plane 
carrying wounded from the front. It 
was an interesting trip but a terri­
bly sad one, in that these boys had 
all suffered major wounds.
“To all those who are giving their 
blood, keep up the good work and 
try to get the word across to the 
people that the blood plasma is 
needed and used—I know, I have 
seen it used and have seen the re­
sults of its use. It is getting to the 
very forward areas, and without it 
the doctor’s skill would be useless. 
You know that the blood plasma is 
needed and without the gifts of 
blood that the people ^re giving— 
well, there would be many more 
thousands of casualties.”
With such an inspiring message as 
this to remind us of the need for 
blood plasma, Tech students should 
come all*-out for this last blood 
donor’s rally during the week of 
March 22 to April 1. Tech’s goal is 
175 donors. Any volunteer can sign 
up in the girl’s gym in room 101, in 
Margaret Morrison, or in the Ad­
ministration Building.
Annual Carnival Features
2 Dances, Aft. Nonsense
In spite of wartime restrictions, 
a smaller student body, and the ac­
celerated program Carnegie Tech is 
going to hold its annual Spring Car­
nival on March 24th and 25th. Many 
events held in former years will be 
impossible, and the prevalence of 
uniforms will inject a more serious 
note into the affair, but there still 
will be enough to do and enough to 
see to make this year’s Carnival as 
memorable an event as ever.
The program will open on Friday 
night with a Military Ball. Big 
things are planned for the evening 
—the Army Regimental Band will 
play in the gym which will be ar­
ranged in night club fashion, and 
the Dramats are going to pep up the 
event with a floor show.
On Saturday afternoon the gym 
will undergo another change, for 
then the fraternities, sororities, and 
the companies of the ASTP will 
make the Carnival a Carnival. Each 
organization will construct a booth 
a la Kennywood with penny pitch­
ing, chuck-a-luck and many other 
games. There will be athletic activ­
ities for sports addicts—rumors are 
going around about a touchfootball 
game between the supermen in En­
gineering and Maggy Murph’s pow­
erful Katrinkas—and there will be 
enough waterfountains to provide 
everyone with refreshment.
The Carnival will be climaxed by 
the traditional super-affair on Sat-

Maggie Murph Frosh 
Have Big Blow-Out
A beautiful blonde imbibing a 
fizzing coke was introduced to Mag­
gie Murph girls last week. “She’s 
refreshing, she’s alluring, she’s a 
freshman,” was her description. But 
the creature wasn’t real—she was 
merely on a sign in the front hall of 
Margaret Morrison announcing the 
Coke Party given for the Freshmen 
by the Sophs last Tuesday.
The purpose of the informal get- 
together at the Union was to pro­
mote better relations between the 
two classes; though popular opinion 
has it that the money in the sopho­
more treasury was burning a hole 
in the treasurer’s pocket.
The Union echoed with rash bids 
of six clubs and seven hearts, min­
gled with the gay laughter which 
always accompanies a Maggie 
Murph bridge game. It was easy to 
know whom you were playing with 
by reading th£ blue and the white 
hatchet-shaped name cards which 
were given the girls when they en­
tered. The afternoon was climaxed 
by refreshments consisting of choc­
olate and vanilla cookies with coke. 
“A swell party,” according to fresh­
man Anita Newell, who expressed 
the general sentiment of her class in 
thanking the sophomores for the af­
fair.
Soldier’s Girl Will Be 
Chosen Army Queen
It’s an old fad, but something new 
has been added! Yes, the search 
for Carnegie Tech’s AST pin-up gal 
is on and “male call” has been 
sounded! In order to enable all Tech 
students ta see the Army’s favorite 
edition of Betty Grable, the Spring 
Carnival Committee has announced 
that a contest will be conducted so 
that each G. I. who buys a ticket to 
the affair can submit a photo of his 
girl.
A committee will judge the pic­
tures and the one that is chosen will 
be invited to Pittsburgh—expenses 
FREE!
Blondes, brunettes, brownettes, 
and redheads are eligible. AST’s 
may submit pictures from Palo Alto 
to Punxsutawney and all points 
north, south, east, or west. Whether 
the little woman is clad in gay 
sarongs or sophisticated satins their 
merits will be considered and judg­
ed accordingly.
Since Spring Carnival is the week 
of March 25, all are urged to pur­
chase tickets and to give their 
photos promptly to their company 
representative, with the entree’s 
name and adress on the back.
The committee guarantees that all 
photos will be returned without 
damage, so include your name and 
address too.
Don’t be timid about this, boys. If 
your little Lady sub one is strictly 
from tops, get on the ball, and show 
the populace around here just how 
ignorant they are of real beauty. 
The only trouble in this contest will 
be selecting one from so many.
Three CWCA Girls 
Complete Her Day
Seven girls from the CWCA, 
Clementine McKenna, Virginia 
Germy, Mary Louise Vincent, Dor­
othy Stewart, Jeanne Norris, Mil­
dred Murrer, and Norma Wallin at­
tended a talk given by Mrs. Roose­
velt Friday evening on the subject 
of “A Lasting Peace.” Mrs. Roose­
velt was one of the many speakers 
at a series of meetings sponsored 
this last week by the National 
Friend’s Society at the Fort Pitt Ho­
tel.
Mrs. Roosevelt’s theme for the 
evening was that “Peoples of all na­
tions, working cooperatively, must 
make the peace.” Without such co­
operation the men at the peace table 
will be helpless. She cited the 
beginning of world-wide coopera­
tion in Britain’s policy of bringing 
airplane workers and airmen to­
gether on visits to the airfield and to 
the airplane factory.
The girls’ general impression of 
Mrs. Roosevelt was that “you feel 
that she’s talking to you” and that 
“she made her talk very interesting 
by bringing in things that she had 
gathered on her trips.”
Director Warden 
Thanks Students
On Wednesday, January 23, Inter­
fraternity and Intersorority Coun­
cils, Citcom Clan, and the Dorm 
Council presented Director Beryl E. 
Warden with a wrist watch in ap­
preciation of his friendship and as 
a token of their esteem.
In answer, Director Warden sent 
the following letter to the four or­
ganizations:
“My surprise was so great that I 
did not properly thank you for the
very generous and practical gift. I 
have always thought highly of Tech 
students, and the gift made me feel 
that the regard is mutual. The gift 
as an expression of sentiment would 
have been more than ample but in 
addition it is very practical. You 
may be interested to know that I 
had planned to go downtown to 
purchase a wrist watch on Wednes­
day afternoon, and so no gift could 
have been more useful and wel­
come.
“May I ask you to convey my 
heartfelt thanks to the students of 
the Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy. Best wishes!”
Sincerely yours,
(signed) B. E. WARDEN.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 29, 1944
ZdiiosiX AimcUafo
Spring Carnival Is Army Good-bye
The lid is off. By April 1, say the bigwigs in Washington, the mass of 
the ASTP will be in troops once again. That doesn’t leave us much time in 
Pittsburgh, and realization of this fact has come to Carnegie Tech. As a final 
splendiferous gesture, it is throwing its annual Spring Carnival on what should 
be our last week-end here. It is planned that this two-day affair shall cater 
to the Army, and be something :to remember. It is Tech’s going-away present 
to the ASTP.
Ordinarily, this affair, which is Tech’s biggest, would be held sometime 
later; but. because of the status of the Army, the date has been jacked up to 
the 24-25 of March. The next week-end—April 1. On Friday night there will 
be a military ball with the Army Orchestra, on Saturday afternoon, a combi­
nation field day and carnival, and on Saturday night, the grand finale with 
the presentation of the Army and campus beauty queens, and a big name band 
playing to—ahem—in the morning.
The officials of Tech are going all-out in their efforts to make this deal 
solid. Plans are working for the elimination of classes from Friday noon; the 
selection of an Army Queen is already under way. But the No. 1 point is this: 
there will be a dormitory open to any guests of the Army. That is to say, for 
example, if you want to bring your girl from home, she can stay in a dorm on 
the campus with no expense, trouble, or inconvenience.
All in all, this should be a good deal; enough pains are being taken with 
its planning, and enough people, for once, are really interested. It’s worth 
a try. J. V.
The Outlook . . •
Sororities Protest
Dear Editor:
We, the undersigned, are writing this letter to bring to the attention of 
the student body, a situation which has caused unnecessary friction amongst 
rival factions on this campus ever since it was discovered that the college 
coed had something besides brains. The problem at hand is that of the elec­
tion, or shall we say selection, of beauty queens. Since way back when, every 
time the occasion has arisen to choose a queen and her court, certain campus 
groups have come out on the short end of the deal. We must admt that at 
times we have been so fortunate as to be on the long end, but nevertheless we 
feel that it is high time a fair method is set up to cover all such situations in 
the future.
This whole question may seem rather petty and trivial in the light of 
world conditions, but taken from the proper angle, it assumes added import­
ance. Since we are fighting for equal representation and minority rights, 
why not begin in the most obvious spot—at home? As the system works at 
the present time, with nominations taken at random from the entire student 
body, the biggest fellow, with the biggest political following, pulls the most 
votes. The slate is then drawn up from the topranking few who will be largely 
if not entirely from one group, since the faction which controls enough votes 
to put one girl in, controls enough to put ten girls in.
Let us present a hypothetical case. A student governing body is to be 
elected composed of 11 voting members from any department in the school, a 
governing body which will represent the entire school. The students are per­
mitted to present eleven names on their ballots. Since the enrollment in the 
College of Engineering far outnumbers that of any other college, it will un­
doubtedly eontrol the largest number of votes. This particular branch of Car­
negie Tech agrees to back eleven engineers for student representatives, re­
gardless of the fact that these eleven are obviously not the students most suited 
to the offices. If such be the procedure, the matter of voting is only a formality 
and in no way constitutes democracy. The eleven engineers will be automat­
ically thrust into office, and neither Margaret Morrison nor the College of Fine 
Arts will be given any representation on the all-college governing board. Two 
years ago, the TARTAN fought tooth and typewriter for a representative gov­
erning board. We ask that it take up this humble cause and secure equal rep­
resentation in other campus function.
On almost every other American college campus, when a beauty queen 
election is held, each women’s organization, sorority, or independent group is 
permitted to submit a candidate, and from these candidates, the Queen and 
her court are chosen by popular election. In this way, each group is at least

It seems that we are to be forever a creature of goodbyes. The latest 
addition to our little black goodbye book is Wally Ellman, our very sharp 
and efficient Sports Editor who leaves the TARTAN to go highbrow with the 
V-12 at Yale.
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the staff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

This week the country is com­
memorating National Brotherhood 
Week by various meetings, discus­
sions, and news-releases sponsored 
by the National Conference of 
Christians and Jews. For the last 
few years, this organization has de­
voted immeasurable time and ef­
fort to improve the relations be­
tween the different religions, and 
between the different “races” of this 
country, and although its progress is 
very slow, its very existance is a ray 
of hope in the darkness of bigotry 
and prejudice which prevails in this 
and so many other countries.
We pride ourselves that we have 
democracy in this country, and that 
we are fighting this war to defend 
it against the onslaught of fascism.
Technically speaking, democracy 
is rule by the people, and according 
to our Constitution, the type of gov­
ernment which ensures the unalien­
able rights of life, liberty, and pur­
suit of happiness. Theoretically, 
ours is a democracy because all our 
governing officials are elected by 
the people, and act as their repre­
sentatives, subject at any time to re­
call and impeachment, because we 
have trial by jury, and no double 
jeopardy. Political science defines 
democracy as the sovereignty of the 
people, and this too would indicate 
that we have democracy.
But these definitions cover just 
an infinitesimal side of the concept 
of democracy. Democracy is a phi­
losophy, a way of life, not only a 
form of government. It is some­
thing which should be felt and en­
acted every minute of every hour of 
every day. It is not only the belief 
of equality and freedom, it em­
bodies the actual carrying out of 
brotherhood among each and every 
individual. A person is not demo­
cratic by going to the polls every 
two years, or by writing a letter to 
a Congressman. We do not have 
democracy because we elect our 
President and the members of Con­
gress, and the traditions of Wash­
ington and Jefferson are not kept up 
by trial of jury, or the recall of a 
government official. There is a need 
for much more than this, and the
goal of the Conference of Christians 
and Jews is to bring home to the 
American people the realization of 
this fact.
They are spending—and but too 
often wasting—time telling us that 
there is no inequality, of religions 
or minority groups, that no man is 
inferior to another only because of 
his creed or color. They want us to 
realize that the essence of fascism is 
racism, and that it is useless to fight 
it on the battlefronts if we do not 
combat it at home. Democracy is 
the acceptance of anyone as your 
equal until he, by his actions, has 
proven himself inferior, not the 
preconception that all members of 
this religion or that group are 
basically dumb, or cruel, or in­
ferior. Detroit riots, and Rankin’s 
demagogy in Congress are as fascis- 
tic as any actions of Hitler’s black­
shirts. When, and only when, we 
shall think instead of fight, and love 
instead of hate, when, as Rabbi Les­
ser stated “each Christian shall be a 
better Christian, and each Jew a 
better Jew,” then we shall have de­
mocracy in this country.
What then can we do to accom­
plish this? First of all we must 
clear our own minds of all the 
prejudices which our parents and 
our surroundings have put there. 
We must realize that just as George 
Washington Carver or Albert Ein­
stein are not great men because of 
their race or creed, but because of 
their eminence in science, a crim­
inal is not wicked because he is col­
ored or Jewish, but because his en­
vironment has warped his charac­
ter. We should bar from our vo­
cabulary words like nigger, wop, 
mick, and kike, and we must learn 
to take so-called Irish and Jewish 
stories for what they are—jokes, not 
characteristic truths. When we have 
accomplished that it is our duty to 
eliminate prejudice in others. We 
must pounce upon anyone proclaim­
ing prejudice, and disprove his ideas 
with the same arguments we have 
used to cleanse our own minds.
Democracy is a way of life—do 
we have democracy?

Letter To The Editor
To the Editor and to the 
Student Body:
We, the members of Interfrater­
nity and Intersorority Councils 
write this letter in order to ac­
quaint you with what we believe 
to be a gross injustice committed 
recently by the members of ACAC.
At the meeting of February 16, 
ACAC passed a petition submitted 
by Interfraternity and Intersority 
Councils, permitting us to hold 
Greek Sing and Swing on March 
25, and also granting that no all­
school social function be permitted 
on that date, since a large percent­
age of the student body would be 
concerned.
At the meeting of February 23, 
ACAC rescinded this petition when 
it became evident that March 25 
was the only feasible date for 
Spring Carnival, and proceeded to 
schedule Spring Carnival for this 
date.
In doing this, ACAC committed 
one violation of principle, and one 
gross injustice. Firstly, Robert’s
“Rules of Order,” by which ACAC 
is governed, state that a petition, 
once granted, cannot, at a subse­
quent date, be rescinded if by that 
petition a contract is formed. Sec­
ondly, ACAC, by not first asking 
the members of Interfraternity and 
Intersorority Councils to withdraw 
their petition, personally insulted 
those individuals. We feel certain 
that those members, having had the 
situation explained to them, would 
gladly have withdrawn the petition 
and tried to make other arrange­
ments.
The whole affair is a matter of 
principle in which we feel that an 
injustice has been done. We think 
that an apology is due, and also a 
provision for preventing a recur­
rence of a similar situation in the 
future.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 29, 1944THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
One of the Boys
Some people around school don’t 
seem to do anything, and a few 
others go out for everything. I. Bur­
ton Faigen—not I, Burton Faigen, as 
malicious rumors want it—is one of 
the latter. Burt at the moment is 
President of Pi Tau Sigma, Director 
of Interfraternity Council, member 
of Interhonorary Council, past Pres­
ident and Treasurer of Tau Delta 
Phi, member of the Kiltie Band, 
member of this year’s Spring Car­
nival Committee, and has just re­
ceived the ultimate honor for any 
engineer—election into Tau Beta Pi. 
He carriers a high factor, and last, 
but quite certainly not least, has 
pinned lovely, Buffalo-born Sally 
Ann Rosenberg.
Born and reared in Pittsburgh, 
Burt began his academic and extra­
curricular career in Homestead 
High. Always one of the highest in 
his class, he was Vice-President of 
the Student Council, President of 
the Math Club, and first cornetist in 
the band. Upon graduation in 1940, 
he took the city-wide Civic Club ex­
am and, placing fifth, came to Car­
negie Tech on a scholarship. He en­
rolled in the Mechanical Engineer­
ing Department and started right off 
in his usual form by hitting the 
Honor Roll and joining the Kiltie 
Band. In his Sophomore year he 
pledged, and was soon initiated into 
Tau Delta Phi Fraternity, where, 
after a few months, he as usual col­
lected offices, becoming Assistant
103 Tech Girls Are 
Now In Armed Forces
One hundred and three girls in 
the service—such is the story told 
by the huge red and white flag 
hanging in Mrs. Jesse Yon’s office.
From the wilds of a South Pacific 
Island to the rugged coast of Aus­
tralia, former Tartan Co-eds are 
serving their country. Though the 
WACS, WAVES, and Nurses’ Corps 
received the majority of volunteers, 
the girls are also acting as dieticians, 
entertainers, Red Cross rehabilita­
tion workers and USO hostesses.
According to Mrs. Yon, the stars 
of the shimmering silk flag made 
by the Costume Economic girls rep­
resent officers as well as privates 
and seamen. A major, a captain, 
and a lieutenant J. G. in the Navy 
were all formerly “her girls” and 
Mrs. Yon explained, “I’m proud of 
every one of them.”
. . . /. Burton Faigen
Treasurer, later Treasurer, and fin­
ally President of the Fraternity.
In spite of the prediction of his 
high school yearbook that ten 
years hence Burt would become 
gymnastics teacher at Vassar, he 
can take his sports and leave them. 
He did, however, go out for the Tau 
Delt intramural mushball team, and 
neither he nor anyone else who wit­
nessed the event will ever forget the 
triple he “hit” in one of last season’s 
games. It happened in the meet 
with the Delts on the not-too- 
smooth soccer field. Burt steps up; 
the pitcher throws a slow ball; Burt 
lets loose a mighty swing, and hits 
a miserable grounder towards first 
base. Never one to give up, how­
ever, he begins to run—Don Mash, 
Delt first baseman, steps forward 
to pick up the rolling ball—the elu­
sive sphere hits a bump and bounces 
over his shoulder. Burt cannot stop 
—moment of inertia and all that— 
and heads towards second. Mash re­
trieves the ball, throws—the second 
baseman misses and Burt, in the in­
nocence of his mind, keeps on run­
ning. Again the ball is picked up, 
thrown wide, and Burt is safe on 
third. After that the Delts were too 
dazed to do anything, and the Tau 
Delts carried home another victory.
Burt has only two hobbies. One 
is classical music, which he knows 
inside out and enjoys both as a lis­
tener and a performer on his trum­
pet. His friends appreciate him 
more in the former capacity, but 
that doesn’t stop him from filling 
the frat house with Wagnerian 
Leitmotifs. His other, and by far 
most important interest is Dramat 
Sally, lucky wearer of his fraternity 
pin. He and she . . . O. K., stop 
kicking, Burt.
I. B. F.’s pet phobias are public 
appearances — he turns beet-red 
whenever more than two people are 
looking at him — and dogs. He 
staunchly refused to as much as 
touch the pup mascot of the Tau 
Delts, and was highly indignant that 
that “so-and-so” kept on attacking 
him. Otherwise he is liked and 
likes everyone, and his brother Ivan, 
who just has enrolled in Carnegie 
Tech, will have a hard time equal­
ing Burt’s achievements.

’Til Leap Year Gives 
Them One Day More
Incidental information for those 
boys who are not handsome enough 
to have the girls chasing them, and 
those girls who are beautiful 
enough not to have to, except for 
world-calendar advocates and others 
interested in medium-period time 
measurement: today is leap day.
Christmas comes but once a year, 
and leap day but once each time 
Roosevelt is re-elected. Coming as 
it does in presidential election year, 
it symbolizes the responsibility we 
have in voting, a responsibility 
which has been pointed up by the 
so-called weaker sex in their excur­
sions against the better judgment 
and proper taste of men. There is 
certainly no question that we have 
an insufficient sense of our respon­
sibility in voting; and slightly ly- 
canthropic tendencies on the part of 
the girls during election years, es­
pecially towards those gifted with 
looks rather than brains, helps 
heighten the consciousness of this 
responsibility. To those who are not 
so gifted as to enjoy this privilege, 
the knowledge that others are 
cursed with this interference with 
their normal path of life is a stim­
ulant to mental processes of such 
diverse natures as jealousy and 
search after final truth. For this 
alone leap day deserves fame — or 
notoriety.
To those who are bored with the 
continual progression of leap years, 
if such utterly antisocial creatures 
exist, we offer the encouragement 
that, comes the year two thousand, 
the girls will have to put away their 
Chanel - No.-5 - scented, aerodynam- 
ically stabilized snoods, and go back 
to moon-eying Frank Sinatra. At 
least by this time, it is hoped, leap 
day will not signify the end of a 
protracted hangover from an extra- 
super pre-campaign F. D. R. birth­
day party.
Regarding the question of acute 
personal consciousness of the ar­
rival of leap day, a large number 
of Tech students have discovered a 
fundamental principle; “Either ya 
got it or ya don’t got it.” If you are 
one of those who got it, leap day 
will be an important part of your 
life. If, on the other hand, you 
don’t got it, leap day is just another 
day at the end of February pro- 
saicly inserted to balance man’s 
desire for order with the solar sys­
tem’s vagaries as a timepiece.

Contests Offers Fame 
To College Orators
An oratorical contest is to be 
sponsored by the Pittsburgh Sun- 
Telegraph and twelve other news­
papers in principal cities. The gen­
eral subject will be “John Paul 
Jones, American” and is open to all 
college students in Western Penn­
sylvania.
Cash prizes from $250 for the first 
prize to $25 for the fifth, sixth, and 
seventh will be awarded local win­
ners by the Sun-Telegraph. A grand 
prize of $1,000 in War Bonds will be 
given to the National winner, and 
in addition there are $100 War Bond 
awards to be given all runner-up 
entrants in the National Finals.
Each high school or college enter­
ed must conduct its own intramur­
al competition, choosing its own 
judges, and follow its own proced­
ure. Individual winners so selected 
then must be announced to the Ora­
torical Editor of the Sun-Telegraph 
not later than March 20th.
City elimination contests will be­
gin about March 24th.
Zone winners will meet for the 
Grand National Contest about April 
12th, in New York. National prizes 
will be awarded there and all ex­
penses of winners are to be paid.
Anyone interested in this contest 
is to see Dr. H. K. Kirkpatrick, 131
I. H., on Tuesday or Wednesday be­
tween eleven and one.
Spring Carnival . . .
Continued from Page 1 
urday night. Jan Savitt’s band may 
furnish the music in some dimly lit 
hall, and sometime during the even­
ing the winner of the forthcoming 
beauty poll will be crowned Spring 
Carnival Queen.
This is just a rough outline of the 
preceedings, and a Spring Carnival 
Committee consisting of ACAC 
members and representatives of the 
various organizations and groups is 
busy working out the details. The 
price of admission has already been 
set — only five dollars will admit 
anyone to all the affairs. Certainly 
the last all-school affair for the 
Army, and probably the last super­
lative event for the duration, the 
Spring Carnival depends on your 
support for its success. Tickets will 
be on sale shortly . . . there is no 
excuse for not buying one.

Brotherhood Week 
Observed By Nation
In accordance with proclamation 
by President Roosevelt, Brother­
hood week was observed through­
out the country last week. The 
theme of the week, “Brotherhood or 
Chaos,” comes directly from the 
president’s message.
In Pittsburgh, the week’s activ­
ities were sponsored by the Pitts­
burgh Round Table of Christians 
and Jews, and by the National Serv­
ice Institute, both of which are in­
ter-cultural groups. These activi­
ties attempted to point out the nec­
essity of maintaining a brotherhood 
of all racial, cultural, and religious 
groups in this nation both in war 
and peace.
The President’s message reads in 
part:
“While we are engaged in a 
mighty struggle to preserve our free 
institutions and to extend the 
boundaries of liberty in the earth, 
it is good for us to pledge renewed 
devotion to the fundamentals upon 
which this nation has been built. 
Brotherhood must prevail. Our in­
escapable choice is brotherhood or 
chaos.”
Tech P and D’s Do 
Fine Job At Canteen
Carnegie Tech has been well rep­
resented lately down at the USO 
Variety Club Canteen in the per­
sonages of two talented misses from 
the Painting and Design Depart­
ment.
Peggy Cole and Charlotte Ever- 
stine, Junior and Sophomore, re­
spectively, have been contributing 
their services to the armed forces by 
drawing portraits on various days 
of the week for any of Uncle Sam’s 
men and women who care to “sit” 
for a few minutes.
Though they have been doing 
pencil sketches chiefly, the girls in­
tend to use other mediums in the fu­
ture. The reactions to this unusual 
mode of entertainment? As Char­
lotte explained, “It’s wonderful. The 
boys are so grateful and we love do­
ing it for them.”

Love-light between grad Joe No­

Talk Of The School
Having nothing better to do the 
other day, (and besides sixteen 
beautiful girls had entered the 
building) I strolled into the Arts 
Building. While I was ambling 
down the marble hall, a drama stu­
dent crawled over to me and asked 
in liquid tones, “Have you seen the 
latest play? You’d like it—it’s lewd 
and obscene.”
* * *
Seeing as how everyone else was 
doing it (so why should we remain 
aloof) we set off to interview some­
one. Standing in front of a blazing 
fireplace in the Hut was an extreme­
ly intelligent looking G. I.
“Pardon us, chum, would you 
mind . . . ?”
“Yes.”
“Are you, uh, . . . ?”
“No.”
“Well, just one more question. 
What do you think of . . . ?”
“Snooty as hell.”
We just smiled and pushed him 
into the fire.
We took a few notes while watch­
ing some chums play bridge in the 
Hut. Generally, it seems as though 
the following system is in vogue 
here at Tech. You might call it the 
anti-Culbertson method.

Tech Girls Thrill 
At Leap Day Prospect
This being Leap Day and all, we 
girls occasionally find ourselves just 
a little overcome. After all, having 
suffered from a more-or-less acute 
man shortage for several years now, 
the prospect of a free rein, even if 
only for one day, is enough to un­
settle some of the weaker minds— 
oops! We forgot! Carnegie, the 
home of the intelligentsia has no 
weak minds—let’s .just say the less 
strong minds—around here. How­
ever, even in the fever of anticipa­
tion, we are not forgetful of our 
friends among our own sex. In 
proof of this statement we offer a 
bit of copy found lying around the 
Tartan office last Friday, almost lost 
in the usual Friday-night-losing- 
our-minds shuffle. It is reproduc­
ed as written, without editorial 
comment.
“All her friends on the Tartan 
staff and in the many other organi­
zations on campus where she has 
been so a time as of now. We hope 
she gets well soon, get out of that 
stuffy old hospital room, and back 
on campus. So only do we want 
her back; we need her. All her 
friends on the Tartan staff and in 
the many other organizations where 
she has been so active have been 
missing Adeline she gets out of that 
stuffy old hospital room, and back 
on campus. Not only do we miss 
her we need her.”
Sororities Protest . . .
Continued from Page 2? 
given a running chance. Certainly 
no one can deny that every sorority 
or independent organization has at 
least one outstanding contribution to 
make to the roster of glamorous and 
popular femmes. In the recent Senior 
Campus Queen elections, of the eight 
then existing sororities, only three 
were represented in the court.
The latest violation of a democratic 
creed is the recent election of the five 
THISTLE queens. No one but the 
actual members of the staff of that 
publication were present at the elec­
tion, a subject in itself worthy of dis­
pute. Aside from the fact that we do 
not consider the THISTLE staff to 
have an unbiased opinion, we do not 
acknowledge their right to promote a 
move that can have such far reaching 
effects. The THISTLE is largely a 
senior year book, and as such travels 
to distant sections of the country as 
the representative campus publication. 
Is it representative if the beauty 
queens are chosen from less than one- 
third of the sororities and independ­
ent organizations? Is it representa­
tive if each campus group is not given 
the opportunity to submit a candi­
date ? It it representative if it ignores 
some of the more outstanding girls at 
Carnegie Tech in favor of those of 
lesser note?

From Hallowed Harvard Comes 
Sergeant Jaffe, Co. E Topkick
Critical Temperature . . . .
From Harvard Law School to a 
successful law career to a first ser- 
geantcy in the army—these in brief 
are the accomplishments of First 
Sergeant Theodore Jaffe during the 
last nine years. Besides his duties 
as “topkick” of Company E, Ser­
geant Jaffe lectures on military law 
and is now income tax consultant 
for this unit.
Born in Providence, Rhode Island, 
“not too many years ago,” he re­
ceived a Ph. B. from Brown Uni­
versity in 1932 and a LL.B. from 
Harvard Law School in 1935. From 
then until his induction into the 
army, he practiced law in Rhode 
Island and Massachusetts, specializ­
ing in taxation and legislation. He 
served as president of the National 
Retail Liquor Store Package Asso­
ciation in 1940 and as a member of 
the executive committee of the Con­
ference of Alcoholic Beverages In­
dustries.
Sergeant Jaffe came to Tech’s 
AST Unit last July from the Med­
ical Replacement Training Center 
at Camp Pickett, Virginia. Induct­
ed on Friday, the 13th of February, 
1942, he was promoted to corporal 
within two months and was given 
first sergeant’s stripes early last 
year.
Though never at a loss for words 
when speaking in public, the ser­
geant found difficulty in talking 
about himself during our interview. 
A strictly GI “topkick”, Jaffe per­
sonally is genial and pleasant; Com­
pany E men will tell you that “he’s 
not as tough as he tries to be.” His 
objective has consistently been to 
“have the best trained and best 
disciplined outfit in the regiment.”
At Brown he participated in de­
bating and intramural athletics, 
while Harvard was “strictly work.” 
He claims that he collected more 
honors in intramural events than 
he could have gotten as a member 
of a varsity team. His greatest 
track achievement, however, came 
while at Harvard, when he narrow­
ly escaped the clutches of a jealous 
suitor whose girl friend he had vis­
ited. A long knife (“It looked more 
like a sword”) in the hands of the 
potential assailant provided the nec-

essary inducement for this track 
laurel.
One of his earliest and most in­
teresting cases concerned the grant­
ing of voting rights to men stationed 
at a CCC camp in Rhode Island. A 
city in that state had refused to per­
mit the men to vote in the forth­
coming election despite the fact that 
they had registered and established 
residency in the state. Given the 
case by the CCC men the Saturday 
afternoon previous to the election, 
he made necessary interviews on 
Sunday and brought suit the follow­
ing day in the State Supreme Court. 
The court registered an opinion in 
his favor that very evening, just 
twelve hours before the polls open­
ed.
The bachelor sergeant has great­
ly enjoyed his stay at Carnegie, 
which is the only co-educational 
school he has ever attended. His 
present ambition is to marry and 
settle down before he leaves Pitts­
burgh. “I’m just a home loving man 
at heart,” the sergeant consistently 
maintains, majority opinion not­
withstanding.
Cwens Give Frosh Teas
This week, the Cwens, Carnegie 
girls’ honorary sorority, will give 
three informal teas for the fresh­
men girls in the colleges of Mar­
garet Morrison, Fine Arts, and En­
gineering. The teas, which will be 
held on February 29, March 1, and 
March 2, at Carnegie Union, be­
tween 4:00 and 6:00 o’clock, are for 
the purpose of furnishing an op­
portunity for the Cwens to get ac­
quainted with the freshmen girls in 
the different schools.
Heading the committee for the 
teas are Scotty Atkinson and Evelyn 
MacNeill. They are hoping that all 
of the girls will accept the invita­
tions which will be mailed out to 
them.
Naturally every Tech student 
worth his salt wants to go down to 
Carnegie Institute to see the Asso­
ciated Artists Exhibition, now that 
Tech has at least come into a really 
limey limelight with its President 
not only winner of the prize for 
painting but also sitter for the first 
prize picture. Those who have not 
been regularly attending the Asso­
ciated Artist’s shows may find a sur­
prise in store for them, for these 
shows are quite different from the 
usual exhibitions at the museum. 
The difference lies in that, while the 
International (and its successors) 
have paintings, this exhibition has 
also prints, water colors, sculpture, 
jewelry, ceramics, and textiles.
While you are there you must be 
sure to have a look at one picture 
which has been widely discussed, 
“Here and Everywhere,” by Mac 
Gilvary. It is a large picture done 
mostly in grays and blues, of cos­
mic scope. The present world con­
flict, and the insignificance of the 
earth and its inhabitants, are both 
suggested. The picture itself shows 
a globe in a starry sky, supported by 
the hand of God, with a baby seated 
“on top of the world.” There is more 
to it than that, but the description 
could not do it justice. Whether it’s 
a great painting or not I don’t know, 
but it is certainly very different in 
conception and treatment from any 
other modern work I have ever 
seen.
Usual Lack of Student 
Support in Bond Drive
The members of the War Bond 
Committee for Carnegie Tech, Miss 
Louise Russell, Mr. Norman Dawes, 
Miss Dorothy Kanrich, and Miss 
Doris Myers, revealed in a report 
Friday night that the purchase of 
war bonds in the 4th War Bond 
Drive had reached approximately 
two-sevenths of Tech’s quota. By to­
day Carnegie was supposed to have 
raised $70,000, but the figure stood
By Hannah Estermann 
Another very interesting painting 
is “Pax Vobiscum” an almost sur­
realistic piece of a nun in a gas 
mask, the flames of a bombed city 
reflected in the goggles of the mask. 
To finish with the paintings, if your 
taste is like mine you will also like 
Trapp’s “Song in the Night” — a 
clown in limbo playing a lute—the 
picture of the convent kitchen, and 
Mr. Hilton’s barn, as well as several 
others. Much more interesting than 
the paintings, however, were the 
sculpture, ceramics, and metal 
work, although the water colors, 
usually so refreshing, are disap­
pointing this time. There is a very 
beautiful set of pewter tray and 
coasters, almost Greek in its sim­
plicity, and most of the rings and 
earrings are so fine that no one 
would ever think they were made 
by hand. By far the most novel 
thing in the show is a self-portrait 
by Henry Burstynowicz (No, the 
printer didn’t get drunk last night, 
that’s really his name!) in wire. 
This is a new technique which is 
just coming into fashion, sort of a 
three-dimensional caricature, and 
very amusing.
On the whole, however, this 
year’s exhibition was a little disap­
pointing. By far the largest por­
tion was oil painting, and most of 
the paintings were . . . well, unin­
teresting. Apparently war effects 
artists indirectly as well as directly.

little hope of reaching the assign­

had been purchased by 188 subscrib­
ers. The civilian students were 
showing an unparalled patriotism 
by having six subscribers on the 
list, while 42 AST men had bought 
bonds. However, the civilian stu­
dent buyers have shown a consid­
erable increase from the round 
number of two purchasers in the

SPORTS
Begin New Intra-section Loop; 
All Sections Will Have TeamsS
OLDIER
PORT 
LANTS
Perhaps you’ve noticed that the 
something that has been added is 
the new Section Basketball league. 
It will be run on a tournament basis 
and the results will be posted con­
currently both in this paper and 
also on the wall of the downstairs 
gymnasium hallway.
No one can doubt but that the 
league is a fine idea. It will allow 
many men not hitherto able to play 
basketball a chance to gain experi­
ence in this game from which so 
much fun and pleasure can be de­
rived.* * *
With the current basketball sea­
son drawing to a close, it might be 
a good idea to sum up the record of 
our highly touted and credit-deserv­
ing team. The Uniteers, or by their 
official name: the 3302 nd Service 
Unit Regimental Basketball Team, 
have played 15 games. Of this num­
ber, they have won 13 and lost 2. 
They won the first game they play­
ed from Sewickley Coast Guard by 
a score of 48-37. The second game 
brought on Westminster Navy. This 
game was won easily by a score of 
51-22. The Westinghouse Appren­
tices gave them a slight struggle but 
the Uniteers eventually nosed out a 
56-45 win. And then—the Mc­
Keesport <fBig 5.” The team lost 
their first by a score of 73-52. They 
next took on and defeated West­
minster ASTU 66-45.
Sewickley “Y” was the next un­
fortunate opponent. The Regi­
mental team won by a score of 52-
36. For the next game, the Uniteers 
met the YMHA on the Y’s own 
floor and defeated them 59-51. In 
their eighth game the team defeated 
Camp Reynolds, a highly touted 
team, by a score of 51-44.
The ninth game brought on the 
Westinghouse Apprentices for the 
second meeting—the Uniteers de­
feated them again. This time it was 
65-48.
Ambridge Tech Stars, their next 
opponent, were beaten by a score 
of 61-43. Those of you who saw the 
game will remember the sparkling 
play of Holets, an ex-Tech man.
Pitt Dental provided little opposi­
tion in the eleventh game and 3302 
came through again 51-26. Mellon 
Institute, their next opponent, 
through the outstanding feat of 
Skiles and Haines in gaining 24 
points apiece, took our team for 
their second and last, to date, de­
feat.
Camp Reynolds met us here for 
the next game and we took them 
again 63-50, and thereby won the 
imaginary Western Pennsylvania 
Service championship.
The Teamsters came next and 
they went down too. Notwithstand­
ing the fine team they boasted and 
the fact that they were leading the 
Municipal League, the Uniteers 
took them 168-43.
The last game to date brought the 
Westminster AST Uniteers back for 
a return match which turned out 
to be a scoring spree. The 3302 
Service Unit team, of course, won 
by a score of 92-62.
Without a doubt the intramural 
basketball league has definitely 
proven that intramural sports, when 
properly conducted, can provide in­
teresting and exciting games. Next 
week the league will be rounding 
the bend and heading down the 
home stretch. The final week and a 
half should provide the usual sup­
ply of thrillers before a champion 
finally emerges through the haze of 
a scrambled race.
Starting last week’s competition 
was the Beta-SAE game. The 
SAE’s, after having been upset by 
the boys from Delta Upsilon, gained 
momentum by defeating Theta Xi. 
Continuing their steam roller tactics 
the SAE’s defeated a strong Beta ag­
gregation 28-20. By winning this 
game, the SAE’s emerged as league 
leaders with a record of four vic­
tories against only one defeat. It 
seems from here that unless the un­
expected happens they will retain 
it.
First on the Wednesday night 
schedule was the Theta Xi-Beta Sig 
game. This game proved to be one 
of the real thrillers of the season; it 
was impossible to determine which

Increments:
If you should see any loose incre­
ments (little men about two inches 
high, knotty kneed, bandy legged, 
warty faced, long black hair, wear­
ing purple trunks, long black cape 
and a tall, purple hat) don’t ignore 
them. Grab them and return them 
to Pete. Pete (Everybody thinks 
I’m stupid) Bianchetta uses them in 
his Radio Lab. Originally he had 
only three, but circuits are getting 
so complicated nowadays that he 
has been forced to import a few 
dozen more. Consequently, he has 
had trouble controlling them. They 
are very mischievous, so if your best 
girl refuses to pitch a little woo, 
blame it on the little devils. Only an 
increment could cause this to hap­
pen in this era of man scarcity. An 
example of the increments’ work: 
in a filter, one increment, usually 
Basil, pushes the sine wave through 
a strainer, while another increment, 
always Bruno, lops off the peaks of 
the wave with a sharp knife.* * *

That is the record of the team .to 
date, and fine record it is. Many 
teams would like to win 86.66% of 
their games. If you are statistically 
minded, we would like to offer this 
to you. The regimental basketball 
team has rolled up 908 points in 
their 15 games as compared to 659 
for their opponents. That gives our 
team a 60.53 point average per game 
as compared to the 43.93 points per 
game average gained by all their 
opponents in those games played 
with the Uniteers.

team would be the victor until the 
final whistle. In fact, the game has 
been formally protested by the Beta 
Sigs. The score thus far stands 18- 
17 in favor of Theta Xi.
In the second game of the same 
night, the Delts kept their cham­
pion aspiration alive by defeating 
the second place Tau Delts 28-22. As 
was to be expected in a clash be­
tween two of the leagues better 
teams, most of the game was fought 
on pretty even terms. Les Wahren- 
burg proved to be the difference be­
tween the two teams and the Tau 
Delts inability to guard Less during 
the early stages of the game was the 
deciding factor in their defeat. 
Rounding out last week’s intra­
mural schedule was the Citcom- 
Kappa Sig game, which was won by 
Citcom.

Case Natators Prove 
To Be Too Much For 
Skibo Swimming Team
The boys representing the Case 
swimming team certainly proved 
that no one need fear that our navy 
is not at home in the water. Display­
ing a versatile powerhouse, the Case 
natators defeated the Tartans 52-23 
at the home pool last Saturday.
Our swimmers fought hard and 
showed promise of doing much bet­
ter in future matches. One thing 
every student who doesn’t have 
something important to do next Sat­
urday afternoon could do to help 
the spirit of the boys on the team 
would be to attend next week’s 
meet with the YMCA. The contest 
will be held at the Carnegie pool 
at 3:15 P.M.
The results of the contest with 
Case are:
300-yard medley relay—Won by 
Case (Bloome, Crampton, Carle- 
ton). Time. 3:41.6.
20-yard free style—Won by Gund- 
lach, Case; second, Johe, Tech; 
third, Charleton, Case. Time. 2:45.
50-yard dash—Won by Roberts, 
Case; second, Eyman, Tech; third, 
Charleton, Case. Time. 2:20.6.
Diving—Won by Emerson, Tech; 
second, Bowman, Case; third, Bing­
ham, Tech. Points, 129.3.

Uniteers Win Another 
In Army Doubleheader
Basketball fans at the all-Army 
doubleheader last Wednesday even­
ing were treated to the alpha and 
omega of the court sport as the 
Regulars of the Carnegie ASTU 
swamped a strong Westminster 
ASTU quintet 92-62, and the Reg­
imental Reserves bowed to the 
Dravo Engineers, 36-28. Paced by 
Steve Gaza’s high scoring and the 
floor play of Chapman and Cran- 
mer, the Carnegie ASTU Varsity 
ran wild after a closely contested 
first half to rack up the season’s 
high scoring mark for the team. The 
khaki-clad visitors put up a strong 
fight for the first twenty minutes, 
never being more than seven points 
in arrears and, at one time—just be­
fore the half ended, 42-35—narrow­
ed the margin to four counters. But 
with Steve Gaza pouring them 
through the hoop at the rate of a 
point a minute, the Varsity stretch­
ed the difference to a 68-44 margin 
at the end of the third canto and 
from that point to the final gun the 
question was how much. Gaza, to 
coin a phrase, was the leading scor­
er, registering 37 points on eighteen 
field goals and a single free throw 
to tie his previous high for the sea­
son. Chapman scored eighteen 
points to match the best efforts of 
Adkins, the Westminster scoring 
leader.
Westminster ASTU was slow in 
starting and Tech jumped to a 22- 
15 lead at the first quarter mark. 
But from there to the mid-game 
gun, the visitors matched Tech point 
for point. When the end of the 
game neared and the issue was 
clarified, the fans hollered for nine­
ty points and Gaza obliged with a 
one-hander from under the basket. 
It was the second victory over the 
visitors from Westminster for Tech 
Army, the loc'al representatives 
having racked up a 66-45 win in an 
early season encounter.
In the initial game of the evening, 
Carnegie ASTU Reserves bowed to 
the Dravo Engineers, 36-28. The 
Army team held a 2-1 lead for the 
first three minutes of the game but 
from there the laurels went to the 
Shipyarders, who went on to a
9-4 lead at the quarter and a 21-14 
margin at the half. The second half 
saw the ASTU Reserves stage a be­
lated rally, falling short by four 
points in the last few minutes of 
play as the visitors poured on the 
heat. Whipkey, with 11 points, and 
Silla, with 9, led the Dravos, while 
Leizman tallied 6 for the Army.
AST Reserves Defeat 
Army Induction Five
The ASTP Reserves, following 
the example set by the ASTP Reg­
ulars, notched another win the 
other night. Led by Mike Elting, 
the Reservists bested the Army In­
duction 1373th S. U. fiye by a score 
of 35-26. Lt. Meyer’s charges have 
not lost a game in the second of the 
Pittsburgh Service League and, 
consequently, are in sole possession 
of first place.
The Reservists got off to a healthy 
first half lead of 18-8 which they 
never relinquished.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 29, 1944THE CARNEGIE TARTAN7
SPORTS
THE GRANDSTAND
With the basketball season draw­
ing rapidly to a close, only two 
games remaining on the schedule, 
the sports scene at Carnegie will 
soon be centered about intramural 
sports programs. The question be­
fore the house at the moment is do 
the students at Carnegie want an 
extensive intramural program 
throughout the rest of this semester 
and during the forthcoming sum­
mer semester? Perhaps it may seem 
as though the entire problem is ir­
relevant, or too far into the distant 
future to deserve consideration 
now; but the fact remains that if 
there are to be any sports at all at 
Carnegie at the end of this semester, 
they will undoubtedly have to be 
intramural sports.
We believe that the intramural 
basketball season, which is still go­
ing strong, proves beyond a doubt 
that intramural sports are capable 
of mustering the interest and sup­
port of the student body. However, 
with so many students leaving for 
the armed forces at the end of this 
semester, it is rapidly becoming 
evident that even the intramural 
program will have to struggle in 
order to survive. In addition, those 
students who make the quota will 
want to spend most of their spare 
time studying in order to remain in 
school. Nevertheless the situation, 
black as it may seem, is far from 
hopeless. All that is really needed 
in order to have an intramural 
sports program this summer is de­
termination on the part of the stu­
dent body, and enough advance 
planning to insure its success.
What possible sports could be 
used as the nucleus of a summer in­
tramural program? Obviously a 
softball league will be nearly im­
possible because of the forthcoming 
manpower shortage. But softball is 
not the only summer sport which is 
fun to play and can arouse student 
support. There is no reason, for ex­
ample, why an intramural track 
program could not be organized. By 
limiting the number of events and 
allowing one man to compete in two 
events, as few as five men would be 
enough to organize a track team. 
Another excellent possibility is an 
intramural swimming program. It 
would not be impossible to establish 
a swimming league and have it go­
ing in full swing before the end of 
this semester. Such a program 
would bridge the sports gap which 
will exist at the conclusion of the 
basketball league. If it were so de­
sired, both swimming and track 
could be incorporated into one pro­
gram.
Sports such as these should have 
a definite appeal to the student 
body. In addition, both swimming 
and track provide real physical ben­
efits for those who participate. But 
the biggest advantage of these 
sports under the existing circum-
- stances is the fact that those organ­
izations, which have suffered most.
By Marshall Nurenberg
from manpower losses will not be at 
a great disadvantage to those which 
haven’t. However, if such a pro­
gram is to have a chance of being 
successful, the support of everyone 
on campus will be necessary, includ­
ing the independents. There is no 
good reason why the independents 
do not have a team entered in the 
basketball league, except for the 
fact that they were not interested. 
Of course there is a war on and it 
creates many difficulties. Almost 
all leaders in the field of physical 
education are of the opinion, how­
ever, that today more than ever be­
fore sports are a necessary part of 
college life. If those Carnegie stu­
dents who remain next semester do 
not want to spend their summer eat­
ing, sleeping, and pushing a slip- 
stick around, they had better begin 
to act now.* * *
Good Luck Wally
We wish to take this opportunity 
to wish one of the nicest fellows 
who ever worked on this paper the 
best of luck. Wally Ellman had a 
rather short tenure of office as 
sports editor, but during that time 
he instituted many novel ideas 
which we believe helped to make 
this section of the Tartan more in­
teresting. Both Star of the Week 
and The Grandstand were originat­
ed by Walt. Best of luck to you 
Wally, and don’t forget to drop in 
and say hello when you get your 
first furlough.
* * *
Support of the Swimming Team
One of the saddest sights we ever 
saw, or more correctly heard, was 
the cheering at the Carnegie-Gene- 
va basketball game. Astounding as 
it may seem, the Geneva rooters 
actually shouted and cheered with 
as much volume as our own stu­
dents, and on the Tartan home 
court.
In case you are wondering why 
we are rehashing what is now an 
old story, remember that although 
the basketball season is nearly fin­
ished there will be varsity swim­
ming meets at the home pool. Any 
boy who takes the time and puts 
forth the effort to participate in a 
varsity sport deserves the support 
of the student body, and it is up to 
you to see that he gets it.
Never forget that anybody can 
cheer and support a winning team, 
but it takes real school spirit to be 
at every game whether the team 
wins or loses. *It takes even more 
school spirit to keep right on cheer­
ing when the team has a little hard 
luck, or is up against an obviously 
superior opponent.
Under the present set up it is easy 
to see why civilian teams, such as 
those of Carnegie Tech, have an 
unduly difficult task and therefore 
deserve more student support than 
ever before. The sad fact is that 
they are getting less — much less 
than they deserve..
Co. Basketball League 
Is Off To Good Start
, The Company Basketball League 
got off to a flying start last Monday 
when Co. A took over Co. B by a 
score of 69-27. Tuesday brought 
Companies C and D together with 
Co. C emerging victorious by a 
score of 47-17. Co. E beat Co. A on 
Wednesday in closely fought duel 
by a score of 39-35. Much interest 
was displayed in this game as both 
companies have strong teams. Fu­
ture meetings of these two teams 
should be very interesting. Co. C 
won their second game of the week 
on Thursday by defeating Co. B 30- 
19. On Friday Co. E defeated the 
combination Co. D-reserve team by 
a score of 43-33 for their second win.
The league standings at the end of 
the final week are as follows:
Co. Won Lost Pet.
E .................................................. 2 0 1.000
C .................................................. 2 0 1.000
A .................................................. 1 l .500
D .............................................................. 0 2 .000
B .................................................. 0 2 .000
Co. E Wins True Thriller
In one of the most hard fought 
basketball games in the first week 
of the Company Basketball League 
Company E defeated Co. A 3-35 
.Wednesday evening in the Girl’s 
Gym. The game was a heads-up tilt 
featuring strategy. Co. E, coached 
by Pvt. Horgan, used a zone defense 
which seemed to stop Co. A.
The first quarter ended in an 8 all 
tie. Co. A had the lead at the half 
mark, 15-13. The Co. E team came 
ahead in the third canto to a two 
point lead at the waltz time mark, 
25-23. The last stanza showed spurts 
on the part of both teams. The final 
score showed Co. E triumphing by a 
39-35 score.
Rees and Lapof, both of Co. E, tied 
for high scoring with 12 points 
apiece. George and Randall each 
had 8 points to make them the top 
scorers of Co. A.

Skibo’s Win Practice Game
Last week’s practice game with a 
makeshift Duquesne five proved 
that the Tartan quintette can swish 
the hoops more often than their op­
ponents. The Tartans won an easy 
55-33 victory.
High scorer for the Tartans was 
Johnny Shott who tallied 16 points. 
Following close behind were Jack 
Sherman and Bud Hathaway who 
scored 14 and 12 points respectively. 
The fourth high scorer was Ernie 
Lemberski with 6 points. Ernie has 
been doing some excellent reserve 
work throughout the season. Com­
pleting the totals for Carnegie were 
Bill Scherb with 5 points and Mai 
Festenstein with 2 points.
Intramural Race Is 
Close and Hard Fought
The new edition of the Intramural 
section League got off to an auspici­
ous start with two games on Febru­
ary 23.
B 42 TRUMPS B 41 IN LEAGUE 
OPENER
In a game marked by roughness 
and the accurate and timely shoot­
ing of Fesher, B42 copped the open­
ing game of the brand new league. 
The first half was rather slow, wind­
ing up with the peculiar score of 7 
up. Through the second half B42 
steadily pulled ahead to win by a 
, not too comfortable margin of five 
points. The score: B41-22, B41-17.
HAPLESS B12 FIVE TROUNCED
In the running only in the first 
quarter, the B12 five was badly 
beaten by a hot Bll aggregation. 
Ager and Adams ran the show for 
Bll in the first half; in the second 
half Wallin and Stanley took over 
and polished the game off. Crosby 
and Stanley were high men for the 
contest with ten points each. The 
score: Bll-44, B12-22.
THRILLER OF WEEK WON BY E51
Led by the versatile Creasy, E51 
nosed out E52 in a thriller, 33-31. 
The game was close throughout the 
four quarters and was in doubt till 
the last second. The clever shoot­
ing and fine all-around floor work 
of Kimble, who scored 13 points, 
was the high point in E51’s bid for 
victory. The score: E51-33, E52-31.
REES LEADS E42 IN 33 POINT 
ROUT OF E41
Scoring freely, without any trou­
ble, E42 pasted E41, 44-11. Led by 
“Big Red” Rees and Rooney, the E42 
outfit had little trouble in drubbing 
the inexperienced opponent. The 
score would have been higher ex­
cept for inaccuracies and the ten­
dency on the part of E42 to hold 
back a bit. Petty led E41 in all 
around play. The score: E42-44, 
E41-11.
INGOLIA STARS IN DEFEAT
Ingolia, garnering fourteen of his 
team’s total of sixteen points, was 
not enough to prevent D12’s defeat 
at the hands of Dll. Due credit 
must be given to Mr. Macorone, who 
somehow sneaked sneaked in for the 
other two points. The Dll squad 
was led by Macchi, who reserved 
all his scoring for the second half. 
Lynch played an excellent floor 
game—the playmaker of the bunch. 
The score: Dll-30, D12-16.
E21 WINS IN SLOW CONTEST
E21 defeated E22 in a closely 
played but slow, contest, 19-14. 
Guarding was the feature of this 
game, which closely resembled the 
previous games played between 
these two sections in the old league. 
Wallace was the mainstay for E21, 
while Ellison played an excellent 
game for E22. Another factor that 
contributed to the low scoring was 
the inaccuracy of the shots—nobody 
seemed to be on. The score: E-21- 
19, E 22 -14.
Note should be given to the fact 
that the league is being played in 
tournament style. Credit should be 
given to Mr. Moses for this fine idea. 
He is administering the league and 
seeing that referees are present at 
all games.

8THL CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 29, 1944<üThe Carnegie ]plaid
While snooping around the Cam­
pus I not only find things but I also 
don’t find things that I should find. 
Where did those two lovely posters 
go from Engineering Hall? One 
was posted on the 16th and the 
other on the 23rd. Could it be that 
someone is taking home those bath­
ing beauties, used to advertise the 
swimming party, for their collection 
of pin-up girls? If they are, it 
would be appreciated if they would 
drop a note to the editor, and he 
will see that they get some without 
their having to take away the post­
ers that the publicity committee 
goes to so much pain to make . . . 
Understand that Mary Jo Weber, 
former Tech night school student, is 
now doing it the easy way—she is 
going to day school and of all things, 
at Pitt. Her evenings have been 
very well spent as she has just grad­
uated from the Nurses’ Aid Course 
at the Presbyterian Hospital . . . 
After that good sales talk Adrian 
and his friend got last Friday about 
the swimming party by those two 
dashing damsels (ahem, ahem) they 
can’t very well put in an ap­
pearance on March 4th . . . Scene 
—Tech Campus, Time—Wednesday 
night, Cast — One boy, two girls. 
Flanders still claims he was only of­
fering protection . . . Boys, atten­
tion! For your information the cute 
number seen dashing around in a 
Ford convertible on Tuesday nights 
is Cynthia Ellis, and she’s a Miss 
too . . . Imagine Bill Kuskie’s em­
barrassment when he asked, “Who’s 
the new girl making posters?”, and 
our editor replied “That’s no girl, 
that’s my wife!” . . . They just told 
me—E S S S means . . . (continued

PeAAxutalUtf,
One of our former Evening School 
students, Lieutenant Robert Nagel, 
of the Dept of Electrical Engi­
neering, is now serving with the Air 
Corps as a navigator. Bob entered 
the service in 1942 and after receiv­
ing his commission at Coral Ga­
bles, Florida, was soon sent to com­
bat duty in Africa.
Of course, Lt. Nagel doesn’t write 
about his ability as a navigator or 
the missions in which he has partic­
ipated, but this is evidenced by the 
fact that he has received the Air 
Medal and three oak leaf clusters. 
He is a living contradiction to the 
belief that the war is changing the 
boys. After the war, he says he is 
going to come home and never 
travel again, he has seen enough 
foreign countries and has had suf­
ficient adventures to last a life time.
We hope the time is not too far 
distant when he can live as he de­
sires in peace and quiet, and join us 
here at Carnegie Evening School.
Swim This Saturday Evening
You won’t have to be a mathema­
tician to appreciate the figures that 
will be strolling around the Gym 
Pool on Saturday, March 4 from 9 
to 11 o’clock. And let us tell you 
there are plenty of feminine Even­
ing students who cut a mean figure! 
And from the reports we hear, there 
will be just as many there to appre­
ciate them. Don’t be a stick in the 
mud, don that bathing suit and 
show the folks we’ve got lots of Bet­
ty Grables and Johnny Weismuel- 
lers at Tech!
Youysay you can’t swim—don’t 
let that stop you. A water polo game 
has been planned to be the main di­
version for the evening. Those who 
were at the swimming party last 
year know how much fun water 
polo can be! And if you are inter­
ested in learning how to swim, some 
of our experts have offered to give 
their assistance, and they guarantee 
results in “Three Easy Lessons.” 
What more can one ask for 35c?
So come out and have a ducky 
time (and we do mean ducky.)
Things to Think About
(This is the fifth in a series of articles discussing the decline of registration in the evening school).
When Carnegie Tech opened its 
doors to admit students in the early 
years of the Twentieth Century, the 
enrollment was limited in many re­
spects. The facilities were not suit­
able for large registration in any 
specific or particular course of study 
and the fullness of the curriculum 
offered by the Institute in later 
years had not been reached.
While Carnegie Tech is located in 
Pittsburgh, it was not the intention 
of its founder to make it a strictly 
urban institution because of its lo­
cation in a large city; rather, An­
drew Carnegie envisioned a large 
demand from the whole district and 
encouragement was extended to 
make use of the available facilities. 
Another point sometimes overlook­
ed is that the Institute was designed 
and developed to cater to both the 
day and evening students on an 
equal basis. In fact, if Mr. Carnegie 
had been able to have his way, there 
would have been established in­
struction on a turn basis (three 
shifts in 24 hours—something ana­
logous to the operation of a steel 
mill). The two session plan, day and 
evening, was the final result and up 
to the present time since the found­
ing of the institution there have 
been continuous regular sessions in 
both groups.
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
must have had many attractions 
acting as magnetes to draw students 
to it. If a resident of this district, 
one is impressed by the number of 
people who have at one time or an­
other attended classes at Carnegie. 
No matter where you go, or into 
what industry, you will note that 
Carnegie Tech has had a hand in 
helping to develop or equip the 
worker with knowledge or some ed­
ucation. This is a fine tribute to the 
—shall we say “super-selling” ap~ 
peal which the Institute had and al-
E S S S
E S S S to the right of me 
E S S S to the left of me, E S S S 
everywhere I look—in the gossip 
column, in the halls; all over the 
Campus. E S S S is beginning to 
haunt me like pink elephants do 
when I’ve had one too many. I ask 
everyone I see, and everyone asks 
me. But all they say is “E S S S.” 
Upon presenting the question to the 
Social Committee, I have been ad­
vised to hold March 18 open for 
what is to be the hit of the semester.
I guess I’ll have to be patient, and 
if I don’t go crazy before next Tues­
day, the Eight-Ball editor promises 
to “lift the cloud off this deep dark 
secret.”
Phi Nu Fraternity is a social fra­
ternity which was organized orig­
inally as an evening school social 
club called “Klanicht.” It was es­
tablished to promote sociability 
and fellowship. The club was first 
founded in 1916 as a “Night Clan” 
in couformity with other groups 
known as clans which were being 
founded at that time according to 
some particular idea or territorial 
division.
Klanicht operated until 1921, call­
ing to its ranks men who had shown 
active interest in school activities, 
supplying opportunities for the stu­
dents from the three colleges to 
meet socially and at the same time 
establishing an objective to stimu­
late active participation in the gen­
eral social activities.
In 1921 the name was changed to 
Phi Nu Fraternity. It affords its 
members fine opportunities for re­
laxation and pleasure through its 
social activities.
The founders of this organization 
realized that if students are to con­
tinue through the many years nec­
essary to complete a course of edu­
cation during evening attendance, 
they must have some interest in 
school other than that supplied by 
their scholastic schedules. To sup­
ply this interest, therefore, they en­
couraged participation in the social 
aspects of campus life.
At least one social affair is held 
each month during the school year, 
and a noonday luncheon is held once 
each week for those members who 
are employed in downtown Pitts­
burgh.
so speaks well for the grade and 
type of students turned out. These 
same students have g9ne forth into 
other sections of the country; 
one needs only to mention Carnegie 
Tech to command respect.
With such a heritage the student 
of Carnegie should heed the warn­
ing given by the extremely low reg­
istration figures and take it upon 
himself individually to see what can 
be done to create more demand for 
the educational facilities offered by 
the Institute. If the Institute is to 
continue to serve, students must be 
on the receiving end.

HOTEL
How many of you remember last 
year’s Engineers’ Stag Banquet? 
Well, being the chairman of that af­
fair, I would like to reminisce a 
bit. In the first place there was 
doubt whether or not the banquet 
should be held considering the pre­
vailing war conditions and its sub­
sequent effect on the manpower 
situation. Now, each previous year, 
council backed up this affair, thus 
assuring its prolognation. However, 
the enormous drop in registration 
cut down the financial status of 
council to such an extent that it 
flatly stated it would not contribute 
a single penny towards the affair. 
This meant that if the banquet were 
to take place, it would have to be 
self sustaining.
After weeks of deliberation a cer­
tain few of us decided to carry the 
annual affair through so that there 
need be no interruption in this tra­
dition of the evening school Engi­
neers. We made an agreement be­
tween us that if the affair were not 
a financial success, we would solely 
suffer the loss.
We had many problems facing us, 
namely: manpower shortage, ra­
tioning, no council funds, time, etc. 
This is the procedure we followed: 
first, an approximation was made as 
to the number expected to attend; 
second, a reasonable price was es­
tablished; third, quoted menus from 
different hotels were obtained; en­
tertainment prices were received 
and fixed costs were determined. 
Now, all of these figures had to be 
thrashed out and a balance met 
whereby the affair would pay for it­
self.
The estimated number of attend­
ants was placed at 185, considering 
that 215 attended in 1942 and the 
war a year older.
Everything was maintained at the 
high caliber of previous banquets— 
entertainment, souvenirs, door 
prizes, speeches—with only a devia­
tion in the type of meal, cold cuts 
with beer on draft. As it turned 
out, 250 attended, eclisping the pre­
vious year’s attendance. This re­
sulted in a sizeable profits
And so, we come to this year’s 
29th annual banquet scheduled for 
the Gold Room of the Roosevelt Ho­
tel, Saturday, April 1st. Last year’s 
profit will go towards sponsoring 
the affair thus assuring either a tur­
key or a chicken dinner. The 
mission will be $3.00 per person.
