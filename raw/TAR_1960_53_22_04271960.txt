“On The Rocks” To Start 
Carnival Off With A Bang
The Scotch ’n Soda Club of Carnegie Tech will once^ 
again unveil its lustre, when “On The Hocks” opens this 
Friday in the Scotch ’n Soda Theatre.
“On The Rocks,” Scotch ’n Soda’s eighteenth annual pro­
motion, is a witty, satirical reveue*----------------------------------------------------------------
Organization for “On The Rocks” 
began in September, and many 
individuals have labored for eight 
months to produce this, the Scotch 
’n Soda’s 1960 showcase.
Best In The Land 
As a collegiate musical, “On 
The Rocks,” promises to be an eve­
ning’s entertainment that every 
one at Tech will be sure to en­
joy, and perhaps even go away 
singing the songs from the show
lat promises five evenings of 
sheer enjoyment. Although the 
“plot” has been kept highly secret 
this year, therfe are some segments 
of the show which have already 
received great attention. One of 
the most popular among club 
members is “The Coffee House 
Faust,” a take-off on the new 
craze of America, with Stu War- 
^hawsky starring as the beat folk- 
|Pnger. “Goldy La Rose,” an 
adaptation from a former Scotch 
'n Soda, show features Wendy 
Steinberg as a stripper whose life 
is now open to all the world— 
over television. Her favorite line: 
“Let me entertain you!”
Original Music 
Although the skits remain a 
good portion of the show, it will 
be the original music from “On 
The Rocks,” that should receive 
fee most praise. “April Moon,” 
which closes the first act, is a cos­
tume number with a nineteen- 
nineties theme that seems to be 
one of the hits of the show. As 
a blend of music and staging it 
will be beautiful. The “Dragstrip 
Drag,” a satire on the teenage 
rock ’n roll generation, opens the 
second act of “On The Rocks” 
with a bang. And the title number 
from the show, “On The Rocks,” 
promises to be a real rouser.
This year’s Scotch ’n Soda has 
been produced through the ef­
forts of a large segment of this 
campus — from all departments.
they have just seen, as proved to 
be the case last year with “Set 
’Em Up Again.” It seems certain, 
at any rate, that the eighteenth 
annual production makes Scotch 
’n Soda once again worthy of the 
title that “Variety” magazine has 
bestowed: “America’s top col­
legiate musical.”
Tickets for “On The Rocks” are 
now selling fast at the ticket 
booth and are $2.50 for Friday 
and Saturday, and $2.00 for next 
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednes­
day. Curtain time is 8:30 each 
night in the Scotch ’n Soda The 
atre.
Point System to 
Judge Booths
Judging for the Spring Carnival 
booths this year will base more 
points on the game than in pre­
vious years. The five judges 
chosen to rate the booths will have 
15 points at their disposal with 
which to rate each game. But be­
sides the game, there are 85 more 
points to be assigned. The maxi­
mum rating for any booth is 
therefore 100 points which are 
broken up into three main cate­
gories and a number of subcate­
gories:

Arts Week In Progress
To Be Climaxed 
By Beaux Arts Ball
Last Saturday officially marked 
the opening of Fine Arts Week in 
the Fine Arts Department of the 
school. During this week, works 
of every student and from, every 
department of the College of Fine 
Arts will be exhibited for the stu­
dents of the other departments 
who hav° had little chance to see 
this aspect of collegiate study.
To date, there have been several 
musical presentations as part of 
the week. On Saturday, a recital 
of student compositions was given 
by the Music Department. Last 
Sunday, Ralph Zitterbart gave a 
piano recital and on Monday, 
Richard Russell presented an orig­
inal musical composition, An- 
themion Suite” for which Sandy 
Simons did paintings and a drama
student recited the poetry Richard 
wrote for the music. This presen­
tation will be given again on May 
13. Tonight, Eleanor Haas will 
give a piano recital in Exhibition 
Hall at 8:30. And on Thursday, the 
entire Music Department will pre­
sent a program of ensemble music.
Exhibition Hall 
Every day this week will find 
Exhibition Hall open to the gen­
eral public with showings of de­
partmental work. The entire week 
during which the Fine Arts Stu­
dents spend so much time prepar­
ing their work for the benefit of 
others will be topped off by the 
Beaux Arts Ball on Saturday 
night, which is a celebration dat 
ing back several years for only the 
students.

much work in their program to 
introduce their candidates to the 
campus. Presentation skits wera

Poetry Contest 
Being Held
A national poetry writing con­
test for students is currently being 
held by The Riverside Church, an 
inter denominational Protestant 
church in New York City. The 
judges will be Horace Gregory of 
Sarah Lawrence College, Josepine 
Miles of the University of Cali­
fornia, and Howard Nemerov of 
Bennington College. Winning 
poems will be published in a 
special anthology, “R iverside 
Poetry 4,” for which Cleanth 
Brooks of Yale will write an in­
troductory essay. Only original 
poems, unpublished except for col­
lege publications, under one hund­
red lines in length will be con­
sidered for the contest, which 
closes May 15, 1960. Students in­
terested in entering their work 
should see Mrs. Hayes, of the De­
partment of English, in A.H. 237- 
B.
Poetic Interest
“The Riverside Church is not 
interest in ‘religious poetry’ as 
such,” according to John M. Pratt, 
Riverside’s Acting Director of Stu­
dent Work. “Our purpose, rather, 
is to encourage the writing of

poetry, to hear what the more 
sensitive and able of our genera­
tion are saying, to explore the 
concerns which they express, and 
to provide an opportunity for their 
work to be published.” Only by 
maintaining a dialogue between 
the Christian faith and the in­
tellectual currents of our time,” 
Mr. Pratt added, “can Christianity 
hope to be relevant to our world.”
Anthologies of collegiate poetry 
have been published by The 
Riverside Church in 1054, 1956, 
and 1958.

place, so thrL a finished product 
could be ready for the opening 
night.
The art director for “On The 
Rocks,” Lawrence Tayloi has 
again achieved something spectac­
ular in his field, in the form of 
the new “On The Rocks” record 
cover. The new, contemporary 
design will be unveiled opening 
night (April 29) and is sure to 
compete favorably with the fin­
est covers made by any recording 
company.
Fine Remembrance
It is hoped that with such an 
excellent record as Scotch ’n Soda 
has produced this year, that more 
people will be singing Scotch ’n 
Soda songs, and remembering the 
show they have seen, years after 
participating in the 1960 musicale 
extraordinaire, “On The Rocks.”
The Bobtone recording of “On 
The Rocks” will go on sale this 
Friday in the Scotch ’n Soda The­
atre during the run of the show. 
The price is $3.98; and after the 
run of “On The Rocks,” the re­
cordings will be on sale through­
out the Pittsburgh area, and in 
selected record stores across the 
nation for the price of $4.98.
It had been the custom in the 
past for Scotch ’n Soda to make a 
recording of the show during the 
actual run by WRCT, and then 
have pressings made from here. 
Because of the quality of the re­
cordings were poor, many of the 
Club’s members had been dis­
couraged from using this pro­
cedure. When it became apparent 
that this year’s production, “On' 
The Rocks,” had some of the 
best music ever heard in Scotch 
’n Soda, the need for a profes­
sional record became even more 
acute.
Bobtone Records
Early in April, Bobtone Records 
was assigned the project t<~ give 
Scotch ’n Soda a professional 
pressing. To achieve this high 
quality, it was necessary to re-

Editorial
At Last... The Limit
A word that has been tossed from one end of the campus 
to the other, apathy is continuously written about, more often 
talked about, and generally acknowledged to be a word which 
aptly describes an all-pervading atmosphere on Tech’s cam­
pus. And in all cases where apathy is the key subject, there 
arises the splendid generalization . . . “Apathy is not good.”
Yet no matter how much or how often people denounce 
this aspect of campus life, no one does anything about it. 
In most cases, but not all, those who speak most vehemently 
on apathy are the most apathetic. And it really doesn’t 
make sense. The mere acknowledgement of something “bad” 
does not and cannot constitute a solution to the problem of 
getting rid of the “bad.” The mere acknowledgement itself 
becomes “bad” when that is the only thing that is done about 
a situation, for eliminating all action against a problem only 
leaves room for the problem to get worse. And that seems to 
exactly be the case on campus. “Yes, apathy exists,” we say, 
and “Yes, it is a negative aspect of campus life” we say, and 
“Yes, something should be done about it” we say — but does 
anyone rouse themselves from their apathetic state, stop just 
saying, and actually do something? ^
Contentment? .
How much longer must we be content to hear that the 
Student Congress elections were again poorly attended, that 
few people are taking advantage of the fine exhibitions and 
performances of the College of Fine Arts, that no one goes to 
assemblies, that our famed Kiltie Band is lacking attention 
on our own campus, that scholastic achievement is slighted, 
that extra-curricular achievement is burdensome, that our 
sports are neglected? How much longer is the campus com­
munity going to placidly accept an acknowledged intellec­
tual apathy, an evident extra-curricular apathy, and an ob­
vious attitude of letting someone else do the job? We seem 
to have hit the limit. We’re not only apathetic about nearly 
every aspect of campus life . . . we’re also, to the discredit 
of our standing as members of a college community, apathetic 
about apathy!
Action Needed
We definitely cannot get more apathetic. What more is 
there to be apathetic about? We can obviously keep on talk­
ing. What topic exists which is more generally accepted as 
“Something-to-complain-about?” And we can readily take 
the easy way out and just plain ignore it. Yet none of this 
action will solve the problem of apathy’s existence which is, 
as everyone knows, a “bad” thing. Doing nothing gains noth­
ing. Doing something other than placidly sitting back and 
waiting for someone else to act might do the trick. It will 
only be when every individual takes the problem of apathy 
as something which directly affects him as a student and goes 
a little out of his way to be non-apathetic that apathy will 
disappear. It definitely will not do so if we continue to be, 
ironically enough, apathetic about apathy.

President Warner 
Cites Progress 
At Carnegie Tech
Stating his belief that a great 
institution of higher learning must 
direct its efforts towards the three 
areas of undergraduate education, 
graduate education, and research 
and scholarly activity, President 
J. C. Warner has cited important 
progress at Carnegie Tech to­
wards these objectives.
His annual report to the Tech 
Board of Trustees, released last 
week, also cited dramatic physical 
changes on the campus.
In the area of undergraduate 
teaching, Dr. Warner pointed to 
many additions 'and improvements 
in the Engineering and Science 
curriculum as part of a continuing 
program to provide the best in a 
liberal professional education.
Margaret Morrison
Likewise, in Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College a new major in 
Bacteriology has been added along 
with changes in the Biology major. 
The Textiles and Clothing option 
in Home Economics has been new­
ly oriented.
The College of Fine Arts has 
been strengthened by a grant of 
$5,000,000 from the A. W. Mellon 
Educational and Charitable Trust 
to provide distinguished professor­
ships and visiting lectureships by 
leading artists and scholars in the 
fine arts.
Graduate Level
Activity on the graduate level is 
moving forward with an increase 
in engineering and science day 
students of 37% over the past 
nine years. In the evening classes 
there is an increase of 79%. Bol­
stering the academic emphasis on 
graduate studies, two important 
residence facilities were dedicated 
this fall.
An addition to the Mudge Grad­
uate House accommodates 90 ad­
ditional students bringing the to­
tal number of graduate students in 
residence to 140. A fifty-two unit 
apartment, the Robert E. Doherty 
Graduate, House, houses married 
married graduate students and 
their families.
Paralleling the rise in graduate 
activity, research budgets have 
grown in nine years from $1,000,-
000 in 1949-50 to $2,300,000 in 
1958-59, an increase of almost two 
and a half times.
Vote of Confidence
In his report, Dr. Warner re­
ferred to the support given to 
Carnegie Tech’s 10-year $29,000,-
000 Development Program as “a 
vote of confidence.” In two and 
a half years since its inception in 
1957, the program has reached 
71.5% of its goal. For the 1958-59 
college year, gifts and subscrip­
tions amounted to $11,372,440.
Construction commenced on ma­
jor development projects. The 
Hunt Library, a gift of Mr. and 
Mrs. Roy A. Hunt, will be com­
pleted in December, 1960 at a cost 
of $2,800,000. A gift of $1,250,000 
from the Sarah Mellon Scaife 
Foundation will provide the Alan 
M. Scaife Hall of Engineering.
Other campus improvements in­
clude the Campus Activities Cen­
ter to be completed in August, 
1960, at a cost of $2,300,000, an ad­
dition to Porter Hall providing ad­
ditional classrooms and offices, a 
new studio theater for the Depart­
ment of Drama, and preliminary 
work on an addition to Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College.
Dr. Warner also mentioned the 
successful initial phase of the Ad­
vanced Placement cooperative pro­
gram between the Pittsburgh 
Board of Education and Carnegie 
Tech. A grant of $75,000 from the 
Fund for the Advancement of Ed­
ucation together with a gift of 
$12,500 from the A. W. Mellon 
Educational and Charitable Trust 
supported a Summer Institute in
1959 which established special 
curriculum and techniques where­
by secondary school teachers pre­
pared Advanced Placement 
courses for gifted students. A 
feature of this new program is the 
interchange of teachers between 
Carnegie Tech and the Pittsburgh 
schools. Two high school teachers 
are teaching English and history

• • •I Readers Write (
Panty Raids
Dear Editor:
I noted with some interest the note put into the Tartfa? 
by one Anselmi. I have never met Anselmi, and I have never 
had the occasion to witness that great release of youthful 
energy known as the pantyraid. Despite these gaps in my
education, I am still appalled by^-----------------------------------------------------------------
some of the things Mr. Anselmi 
appears to believe.
If I understand him right, the
school has some curiously fickle 
friends, who would gladly have 
donated large sums to CIT had it 
not been for the gathering of a 
noisy group of students one day in 
the Morewood Gardens court­
yard. The powers that be (do I 
still interpret fairly?) then de­
cided on a policy of appeasement 
of these misunderstanding bene­
factors.
Thus, we are told, since a mob 
can be defined as consisting of 
five people, onlookers during any 
further incident will be punished. 
Consider the logic of this propo­
sition. Onlookers, he says, are 
guilty. Of what? He does not 
say. But he must. The burden of 
proof is on him, since he is pre­
suming to establish guilt.
No Parallel
If his proposal is just, we should 
be able to find a parallel in law. 
However, laws which have at­
tempted to do what Mr. Anselmi 
suggests, that is, to make mere as­
sembly a crime, have had rough 
going in the courts, unless they 
were explicit in their demonstra­
tion that certain kinds of assem­
bly directly interferred with the 
business of the community| And 
insofar as the guilt of individuals 
is concerned, the reader need not 
be reminded that guilt by asso­
ciation or coincidence has no place 
in American law.
Legal parallels aside, there is a 
bigger issue, I think. At the last 
“pantyraid,” it was claimed by 
victims and witnesses that the po­
lice had entered their homes and 
arrested them for what amounted 
to watching the proceedings. If 
true, this was such a flagrant 
abuse of power, that it would 
seem that the chief problem on 
our hands is that power is over, 
and not under-used. Mr. An­
selmi simply ignores this point, 
and asks for even more arbitrary 
power without making it clear 
how the available power shall be 
used in a way consistent with our 
inherent rights.
It seems to me that his argu­
ment, when stripped down to its 
essentials, runs as follows: The
School needs money; the donators 
are especially sensitive in some 
cases to student misbehavior; 
therefore it is all right for the 
methods he proposes to be used.
Or, more simply stated: the ends 
justify the means. Consider how 
this seems from the point of view 
of the student who innocently 
stands on the periphery of the 
gathering (from where, incident­
ally, his chances of getting caugm 
are the highest). Whether or not 
he is given treatment which 
matches what he might expect 
elsewhere appears to him to be 
dictated by the whim of a capri­
cious donator, and the willingness 
of a combination of several forces 
whose combines power over him 
is considerable, to cooperate in 
harshly enforcing the dictates of 
such a whim. If this seems a dis­
tortion, consider what happeiii? 
last time!
Absurd Argument
The whole structure of Mr. An- 
selmi’s argument is so patently 
absurd, so dizzily imperceptive, 
and so transparently intimidating 
that one wonders whether Mr. An­
selmi wishes to bring us to our 
senses or whether he simply to 
intimidate us.
The device of cornering a dis£ 
tillation of a word’s (“mob” ’s) 
meaning, and then using this defi­
nition as a justification for the 
tampering with a citizen’s inher­
ent rights is a very old one. It 
has been used since time imme­
morial by dictators to get done 
what they want. If one still won­
ders whether what they want. If 
one still wonders whether what 
Anselmi proposes is “just,” con­
sider what would happen if th«v 
language he employs were in ouW 
national constitution! And what 
is right on a grand scale does not 
lose its righteousness when scaled 
down to specifics, or it was effete 
from the beginning.
Resignation In Order?
Since a student would not write 
such an article out of thin air, 
one must presume that Mr. An­
selmi was subjected to some kind 
of pressure. If this actually har^ \ 
pened, it seems to me that Mr. 
Anselmi’s right course would have 
been to resign whatever position 
he held that was exploited in sub­
jecting him to coercion.
Granted that the school has a 
problem, why is Mr. Anselmi 
called upon to assuage its diffi­
culties? Whose dirty wash does he 
do, anyhow?
Glenn Manacher,

Maturity
To those who did in past months speak about maturity, 
permit me to add this. If there are any mature individuals 
residing in the men’s dormitories, they have kept themselves 
so well hidden that they have forfeited all right to repre­
sentation on Men’s Dormitory ?--------------------------------------------------------------—
Council.
(How often is it that elected 
representations — such as Men’s 
Dormitory Council — lose sight of 
the goals which provide the basis 
and justification for the establish­
ment of such an elected represen­
tation and turn to other goals 
which tend to strengthen their 
own position but which do not 
even pretend to benefit those peo­
ple whom they represent? How 
often does such a representation 
enact a measure which is good for 
said representation but does noth­
ing to benefit those whom they 
represent? Such is beaurocracy 
carried out to its most malifnant 
ends.)
Proposal
One month ago I had a sugges­
tion brought up before Men’s Dor­
mitory Council which purported 
to obtain for the residents of the
men’s dorms the right to have 
females visit them in the confinej } 
of their rooms on more than the 
two or three occasions presently 
allowed. That such a suggestion 
did not meet with overwhelming 
approval is a bland understate­
ment. A more realistic and ac­
curate approach indicates that 
Men’s Dormitory Council did not 
even have to tjiink twice about the 
matter (one wonders if they even 
thought once) before filling it* in 
their large circular disposal tyj 
which is relegated all thoughts 
and suggestions which do not 
necessarily benefit Men’s Dormi­
tory Council but which do attempt 
to benefit the residents of the 
men’s dorms.

Council was reflecting upon my

^¦ew Members 
Elected To Tecli’s 
Board of Trustees
The election of seven nationally 
prominent industrial and financial 
leaders to the Board of Trustees 
of Carnegie Tech was disclosed, 
at the Board’s Annual Meeting.
the same time, two Alumni 
Trustees, Mr. Fred Bloom, Presi­
dent of Bloom Engineering of 
Pittsburgh and Mr. J. H. Kindel- 
berger, Chairman of the Board 
of North American Aviation Co., 
Los Angeles, were elected as Life 
Trustees.
Significant Meeting
In what he described as “the 
most significant Board meeting in 
Carnegie Tech’s history,” James 
IVL^Bovard, Chairman, announced 
life following new trustees: Ed­
win R. Broden, President of SKF 
Industries, Philadelphia; Champ 
Carry, President, Pullman In­
corporated, Chicago; Logan T. 
Johnston, President, Armco Steel 
Corporation, Middletown, Ohio; 
John A. Mayer, President, Mellon 
National Bank and Trust Com­
pany, Pittsburgh; Louis C. Lusten- 
berger, President and General 
Manager, W. T. Grant Company, 
Iteto York; Donald L. Putt, Pres­
ident, Institute of Aeronautical 
Services and United Technology 
Corporation, Menlo'Park, Califor­
nia; John E. Swearingen, Jr., 
President? Standard Oil Company 
of Indiana, Chicago.
The election of these outstand­
ing men fulfills the initial objec­
tives set earlier this year when, 
for the first time in its history, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
iöfcctioned with a board of 
trustees separate and apart from 
those of neighboring Carnegie In­
stitute.
The additional members bring 
the Carnegie Tech Board of 
Trustees to a total of 41.
, New Trustees
Among the new trustees, Mr. 
Broden, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Lus- 
tenberger, Mr. Putt, and Mr. 
Swearingen are alumni of the in- 
fÖj|ition which they will serve. 
A recent survey of Tech alumni 
has demonstrated a need for 
broader national representation 
on the Board.
Carnegie Tech has maintained a 
position of leadership in profes­
sional education through its five 
schools and colleges. They in­
clude: the College of Engineering 
and Science, the College of Fine 
Arts, Margaret Morrison Car- 
nf#e College, the School of 
Printing Management, and the 
Graduate School of Industrial Ad­
ministration.
Benjamin F. Fairless, President 
of the American Iron and Steel 
Institute, is Honorary Chairman 
of Tech’s new Board and Chair­
man of the Nominating Commit­
tee. Vice Chairman of the Board 
is Roy A. Hunt, Chairman of the 
Executive Committee of the Alu­
minum ompany of America.
Report—
[continued from page 4] 
at Tech, while two Tech faculty 
members are teaching high school 
classes in the same subjects.
The program has had national 
implications with requests for in­
formation coming from public 
SLi#°l systems throughout the 
coimtry. Harvard and Boston Col­
lege will base a 1960 Summer In­
stitute on experiences learned at 
Carnegie last year.
“Carnegie Tech has continued to 
move forward as an educational 
institution and center of learning 
. . and is obtaining the resources 
necessary for the future,” said Dr. 
Warner in the closing portion of 
his report. “The year was a good 
or^ and, I am sure the prelude to 
JRi such years that are to come.”

Five Story Library To Be 
Completed Jan. 1, 1961
By David C. Pearson
The completion date of the new library has been pushed 
back one month to Jan. 1, 1961 owing to the heavy snow and 
bitter cold of February and March.
The weather caused a three week pause in construction,
but work is now progressing^-----------------------------------------------------------------
normally. At the present time, the 
walls and plumbing are 95 per
cent complete, and by the time 
you read this, the first floor level 
should be in. The end of April 
should see the installation of 
structural steel, and the aluminum 
will go on sometime near the be­
ginning of June.
Five Stories
Delay or no delay, however, 
the new library js certainly worth 
waiting for. Present plans call for 
the structure to be five stories 
high, the first four being of rein­
forced concrete and the fifth floor 
penthouse being structural steel. 
The exterior of the building will 
incorporate dark grey aluminum 
panels and double-glazed glass 
(two panels with an air space 
between them) throughout.
One hundred twenty-eight alu­
minum fins will surround the 
building giving it a sculptured 
look. The base will be of im­
ported Swedish granite and lime­
stone. The overall effect will lend 
a light airy touch to the whole 
structure.
Columned Interior
There will be even more in­
novations within the columned in­
terior of the new library. The 
lobby will occupy the principal 
part of the first floor, and will be
wood paneled. Book stacks will 
be distributed throughout the first 
three floors with the third floor 
featuring a built-in sound system 
with listening rooms making 
possible the study of talking books 
and records.
The fifth floor penthouse will 
house Mrs. Hunt’s valuable collec­
tions, and accordingly will be out­
fitted with walnut paneling, tea- 
wood floors, and assorted alu­
minum and vinyl touches. Planned 
mechanical conveniences include 
elevators, automatic book-lift, and 
a hydraulic sidewalk lift from the

Initiate 9 Juniors
The Tech chapter of Tau Beta 
Pi, national engineering honorary, 
has selected nine outstanding jun­
iors to become members at its in­
itiation ceremonies on May 17.
Those selected will undertake 
a brief pledge training period. 
This training includes the writing 
of a pledge essay to be entered in 
the National Tau Beta Pi Pledge 
Essay Contest and a manual of the 
signatures of the student and fac­
ulty members of Tau Beta Pi now 
on the Tech campus. Initiation 
will be followed by chapter elec­
tions for the coming year and the 
semi-annual banquet at 7:00 at the 
King Edward Restaurant.
A significant step was taken by

all these features, the new library 
will be completely air conditioned

call when it decided to call only
engineering students to member­
ship. Juniors and seniors from the 
departments of physics, chemistry 
and mathematics are technically 
eligible at the present time to be­

even thougTi this organization lyjs 
as its major aim the recognition 
of outstanding ability in the field

ester to once a month is really an 
impractical, unworkable and un­
feasible plan?
/^If this be true, then I must sin­
cerely apologize to Men’s Dormi­
tory Council for any aspersions 
that I may have cast upon their 
maturity or Victorian concepts.
^ Change?
If this i§ not true, then I must 
tenderly advance the prospect that 
our Men’s Dormitory Council is a 
highly reactionary body opposed 
to any and all change. And that 
if such change ever does come 
jout, it is only because the Re 
tionaries are routed by Conser­
vatives advancing implacable and 
just causes. The fact that the 
residents of the men’s dorms have 
not put forth a concerted effort 
to obtain this change indicates the 
general acceptance of this “pros 
pect.”
I further submit that if Men’s 
Dormitor$ Council were to per­
form the unprecedented task of 
investigating the situation on 
($fcer college campuses, they 
would find that many colleges na 
tionally recognized for their 
stature and maturity do not make 
any restriction as to the sex of the 
visitors to the men’s dorms.
Sincerely,
Lester Brickman

IBM
Braille has opened up bright new worlds for thousands and 
thousands of blind persons. However, the difficulty of trans­
lating printed material into this complex “touch language’* 
has limited the number and variety of publications.
To make more Braille material available, a method of tran­
scribing the printed word into Braille automatically has been 
developed by IBM scientists in cooperation with the Ameri­
can Printing House for the Blind.
The text, in punched card form, is processed by a high-speed 
IBM electronic computer. The computer can translate a 
100-page book into its equivalent Braille in less than an hour.*
It takes all kinds of talents to develop computer systems 
that can handle complex jobs like this. Expanding computer 
applications at IBM have created opportunities in research, 
engineering, piogramming and manufacturing. Perhaps one 
of these IBM careers is the “future” you’ve been looking for.

ivben our interviewen will next visit your campus. Or write to Manager

Tech Tliinclads Down Francis 
Train For Meet With Geneva
Tech’s cindermen will face Grove City’s track team at 
1:30 this Saturday afternoon on Schenley Oval. Next Tues­
day, they will travel to Beaver Falls for another West Penn 
Conference meet with Geneva.
In their first four meets, the* 
team has been able to win only 
one. Last Saturday, Case Tech
won a dual meet at the Oval by 
a score of 88-43.
Bruce Dobras was the only one 
of Coach Swaney’s aggregation 
who distinguished himself, win­
ning the mile in 4:48 and coming 
back to take the two mile run in 
10:26.5 Bob Dent figured in a 
three-way tie for first place in the 
pole vault with an excellent leap 
of 11 feet.
Bernie Rowan tied for first in 
the high hurdles with a good 
clocking of 17.4 seconds, and an­
other freshman, Vic Cholewicki, 
won the javelin with a throw of 
145 feet, 3 inches.
In their only win of the season, 
the men beat St. Francis 88-42. 
Mike Swanson won both the shot 
and discus, Phil Chao took both 
dashes, and Dobras continued to 
excel in his specialties, the mile 
and two mile.
Rowan, Cholewicki, and Dent 
also took firsts in this meet. Merle 
King won the 880, Tony Devine 
took the 440, Furman Smith won 
the low hurdles, and Larry 
Schmitz won the broad jump for 
other firsts. The mile relay team 
of Bill Albright, Ed Barvick, Rich 
Boroto, and Tony Devine won 
their second straight race.
The Tartans lost to W&J in an­
other dual meet last Thursday at 
Washington by a score of 79-52. 
Dobras won the two mile, Devine 
the 440, and Dent the pole vault 
for Tech’s best performances of 
the day. Freshmen Rowan and 
Furman Smith combined to take 
both hurdles in the team’s only 
other firsts.

A GUIDE FOR THE LOVELESS
Gentlemen, take warning. June is almost upon us—June, the 
month of brides. Have you got yours yet? If not, don’t de­
spair. You don’t have to be -rich or handsome to get a girl. All 
you have to be is kind, considerate, thoughtful, and obliging— 
in short, a gentleman.
For example, don’t ever call a girl for a date at the last min­
ute. Always give her plenty of advance notice—like three 
months for a coke date, six months for a movie, a year for a 
prom, two years for a public e'xecution. This shows the girl that 
she is not your second or third choice and also gives her ample 
time to select her costume.
And when you ask for a date, do it with a bit of Old World 
gallantry. A poem, for instance, is always sure to please a 
young lady, like this.
I think you're cute,
Daphne La France.
I’U put on a suit,
And take you to a dance.
In the unlikely event that you don’t know any girls named 
Daphne La France, try this:
I think you're cute,
Winifred Jopp.
I’ll put on a suit,
And take you to a hop.
In the extremely unlikely event that you don’t know a Wini­
fred Jopp either, try this:
I think you're cute,
Isabel Prall.
I’ll put on a suit,
And take you to a ball.
If there is no Isabel Prall, Winifred Jopp, or Daphne La 
France on your campus, it is quite obvious why you’ve had 
trouble finding dates all year: you’ve enrolled in an all-male 
school, you old silly!
Next let us take up the question of etiquette once you are 
out on a date with Isabel, Winifred, or Daphne. The first thing 
you do, naturally, is to offer the young lady a Marlboro. Be 
sure, however, to offer her an entire Marlboro—not just 5 
Marlboro butt. Marlboro butts are good of course, but whole 
Marlboros are better. You get an extra inch or two of fine 
flavorful tobacco—and I mean flavorful. Do you think flavor 
went out when filters came in? Well, you’ve got a happy sur­
prise coming when you light a Marlboro. This one really de­
livers the goods on flavor, and when you hand Isabel, Winifred, 
or Daphne a whole, complete, brand-new Marlboro, she will 
know how highly you regard and respect her, and she will grow 
misty and weak with gratitude, which is very important when 
you take her out to dinner, because the only kind of coed a 
college man can afford to feed is a weak and misty coed. Latest 
statistics show that a coed in a normal condition eats one and 
a half times her own weight every twelve hofirs.
At the end of your date with Isabel, Winifred, or Daphne, 
make certain to get her home by curfew time. That is gentle­
manly. Do not leave her at a bus stop. That is rude. Deliver 
her right to her door and, if possible, stop the car when you are 
dropping her off.
The next day send a little thank-you note. A poem is best. 
Like this:
For a wonderful evening, many thank«, ,
Isabel, Winifred, or Daphne.
I’ll take you out for some more merry pranks 
Next Saturday if you'll haph me. e two m*. shuim*«
— — —
We can’t give you rhume but we’ll give you good reason whg 
you’ll enjoy Marlboro and Marlboro’s unfiltered companion 
cigarette, Philip Morris. One word says it all: flavor.
