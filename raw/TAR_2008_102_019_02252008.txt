John “Jack” Thorne, key founder of Carnegie Mellon’s entrepeneurship 
program and beloved professor, died Feb. 13. See page 4 for the full 
article by Heather Tomko on Thorne’s life and work.
For the past two weeks, pro­
tests, vandalisms, resignations, 
and two-day-long sit-ins have 
been the norm at the College of 
William and Mary in Williams­
burg, Va. On Feb. 12, the col­
lege’s president, Gene Nichol, 
resigned after he was told his 
contract would not be renewed 
over the summer. This decision 
regarding the contract was ini­
tiated by the Virginia House of 
Delegates, a group of conserva­
tive alumni, and members of the 
Board of Visitors, the college’s 
governing body.
Met with shock by students 
and faculty, the decision to not 
renew Nichol’s contract, and 
his subsequent resignation, 
have raised many questions as 
to the power of a small group 
of individuals in governing a 
university.
“The faculty is deeply troubled 
and a little disoriented,” said 
Jennifer Bickham Mendez, as­
sociate professor in the depart­
ment of sociology at William and 
Mary.
Mendez has participated in 
the university demonstrations 
over the past two weeks, includ­
ing the first held at the college 
on the day of Nichol’s resigna­
tion, when at least 1500 students 
turned up to protest the news.
Kate Tedesco, a junior Eng­
lish major at William and Mary, 
spoke on the campus environ­
ment over the past two weeks. 
She mentioned a two-day strike 
by both faculty and staff last 
Wednesday and Thursday, a 
vigil ceremony held in front of 
Nichol’s house the day of his 
resignation, and acts of van­
dalism on academic buildings 
last weekend that criticized the 
Board of Visitors for not renew­
ing Nichol’s contract.
“My real issue with the situ­
ation is that Gene really prided 
himself on being a president for 
the students but when he found

On the last stop in his five-university farewell tour, Gates spoke at Carnegie Mellon. He plans to switch to part-time at Microsoft in order to 
work full-time for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation where he will examine the role of technology in the developing world.
RESIGN ,GAGIT
Publisher
Bill Gates wrapped up his 
farewell tour on Thursday in 
Rangos Ballroom, speaking 
about big changes in the future 
of software and his new role as 
a world leader in philanthropy. 
Gates, who is taking a part- 
time post at Microsoft to devote 
himself full-time to the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation, 
spoke on the ways in which us­
ers will interact with software, 
paying particular attention to 
software’s role in the develop­
ing world.
Earlier in the day, Gates had 
the opportunity to speak to fac­
ulty and students in computer 
science about the direction 
in which software is headed 
and who will have access to
technological advances.
“[We discussed] how we do 
a better job of using computer 
science to reach out of people 
around the world so they get 
the benefit of the very rapid in­
novation,” Gates said. “People 
are underestimating the impact 
of software and the ways that 
it can improve a wide range of 
things.”
Evolving software
Gates spoke about new tech­
nologies that have the potential 
to change the way people access 
information through emerging 
touch, pen-stroke, and visual 
interfaces.
In the next few years, Gates 
said, screen technology will be 
cheap enough that users will 
be able to interact with infor­
mation projected on walls and 
tables in the home, office, and 
educational settings. He is also 
optimistic about tablet PCs, 
which make use of touch and 
pen technology. The impact on 
education could be enormous.
“All of the reading and 
note-taking activity will move 
to the digital realm,” Gates 
said, adding that print-based 
encyclopedias, like his friend 
Warren Buffett’s World Book, 
have been made obsolete by 
digital rivals and “all textbooks 
will clearly go that way.”
In a press conference after 
the event, Gates indicated that 
he still reads from many print 
sources, though their days may 
be numbered as Microsoft and 
other companies work with ex­
perts in display technology.
“We don’t have this nice thin
tablet yet,” he said. “As soon as 
we have that, I won’t do much 
paper-based [reading].”
Online learning
Gates also sees great things 
in the future of online learn­
ing. Himself a consumer of 
online coursework, Gates hopes 
that university curriculum can 
be augmented through online 
access to lecturers and better 
accreditation or through testing 
that measures the effectiveness 
of different teaching models.
Of course, when Gates runs 
into trouble with his online 
solid state physics coursework, 
he can call genius physicists, 
but he believes there is strong 
potential to digitize learning at

College first-years are ex­
posed to a new culture of dorm 
life, strange personalities, and, 
most importantly — the dif­
ficulty of college classes. How­
ever, a study from the College 
Board has revealed that college 
first-years may now be increas­
ing their level of preparedness.
According to the survey re­
leased Feb. 13, 15 percent of 
the public high school class of 
2007 received at least one AP 
Exam score of 3 or higher, an 
equivalent to receiving credit in 
a college course.
This number represents a
3 percent increase from four 
years ago, when only 12 percent 
of high school seniors entered 
college with AP credit.
Though this may sound like 
good news for college students- 
to-be, there has been consistent 
debate in the past few months 
over the AP tests as indicators 
of college success.
The College Board sponsored 
two studies at the end of Janu­
ary that examined the effec­
tiveness of AP tests, according 
to www.collegeboard.com.
The first survey was done 
with University of Texas and 
the Texas Higher Education Co­
ordinating Board. The survey 
revealed that students partici­
pating in AP courses and exams 
received higher college grades, 
earned more credits, and gradu­
ated within four years at higher 
rates in comparison to other 
students.
The second report was also 
performed by the University of 
Texas at Austin. The data re­
vealed that among four differ­
ent entering classes at the uni­
versity, students who earned 
credit through AP exams out­
performed those students who 
did not take part in the AP pro­
gram. The students measured 
were at the same academic 
level, indicated by their overall

Yesterday, discussion of 
superwomen, men getting 
manicures, and appropriate 
spheres of influence for the 
sexes dominated the Univer­
sity Center as Carnegie Mellon 
held its annual conference on 
gender issues, MOSAIC. This 
year’s theme, “Gender Fender 
Benders,” wrestled with the 
socio-cultural taboos embed­
ded in gender performance 
and gender spaces. Now in its 
eighth year, MOSAIC aims to 
examine gender constructions 
by bringing together a range 
of academic disciplines in dis­
cussion of gender issues.
“We are very pleased to 
have an accomplished writer 
and educator on gender is­
sues, Michael Kimmel, as our 
keynote speaker this year,” 
said Andrea Cinkovic, a grad­
uate business administration 
student and MOSAIC commit­
tee chair.
The day’s events began at 10 
a.m., with the keynote speech 
from Kimmel, a spokesperson 
for the National Organiza­
tion for Men Against Sexism, 
a pro-feminist educator and 
an activist on issues of mas­
culinity and gender. He is also 
a professor of sociology at the 
State University of New York 
at Stonybrook as well as a pub­
lished author and celebrated
lecturer at college campuses 
and other venues.
For Sunday’s keynote, Kim­
mel spoke on the means of 
implementing and internal­
izing gender equality in and 
away from the college campus 
setting.
Many students were im­
pressed . with Kimmel’s 
keynote.
“The way he talked about 
feminism was really interest­
ing,” said Jessica Chuang, a 
sophomore chemistry major. 
“He said that men shouldn’t be 
threatened by feminism, but 
rather that they should learn 
from it and from the progress 
women have made in order to 
better themselves.”
Faculty members and both 
undergraduate and graduate 
students at Carnegie Mellon 
as well as those of nearby uni­
versities led the sessions, the 
series of which began imme­
diately after the keynote and 
lasted until 4:30 p.m.
Many of the sessions con­
fronted taboo topics of gender, 
while others were specific to 
this year’s theme.
Some of the sessions in­
cluded “How The Real Man 
Got His Groove On,” which 
questioned what it means for 
a woman to act like a man, 
and “Singles Relationship 
Workshop,” in which students

Due to today’s increasingly 
technology-based world, many 
print-based companies have 
been forced to find alterna­
tive means of income. The 
Washington Post is one such 
company that has supple­
mented its income by investing 
significant portions of its 
money in higher education.
Within the past three 
weeks, The Washington Post 
acquired an 8.1 percent stake 
in Corinthian Colleges, Inc., 
a collective organization of
short-term diploma programs 
and associates, bachelor’s, and 
master’s degrees for occupa­
tions in demand.
Its program areas include 
degrees and online study in 
health care, criminal justice, 
and information technology. 
The organization has rapidly 
grown since its creation in 1995 
to include about 100 campuses 
throughout North America, 
including a local branch in 
Pittsburgh.
The Post is also the 
owner of Kaplan, a test

International Silent Auction is held in UC
This past Friday, Students In Free Enterprise (SIFE) hosted an international silent auction with 
CRY America, an organization that provides assistance to underprivileged children in villages in 
India, and 10,000 Villages, a service group that makes efforts to promote fair trade among artisans 
in developing countries and retailers. The auction featured crafts made by international artisans. 
There was also food and refreshments for bidders and onlookers.
On Feb. 8, the House of Representatives approved a bill that would

Carnegie Mellon races to recycling, NASCAR technology
Students rush to RecycleMania
Carnegie Mellon students are taking 
“reduce, reuse, recycle” to a whole new 
level.
Carnegie Mellon stands with more 
than 400 other schools in an intense 
competition of who can gather the 
most recyclables per capita, with the 
amounts measured weekly in pounds.
Running from Jan. 27 to April 5, this 
year’s RecycleMania competition has 
more participants than ever. During 
the 10 weeks, colleges and universi­
ties compete to see which one has the 
greatest recycling rate, largest amount 
of recyclables, and least amount of 
trash. During the week of Feb. 10, 
Carnegie Mellon ranked 54 of 400 in 
the Grand Champion Category, accord­
ing to the Carnegie Mellon website.
There have been a number of initia­
tives aimed at making recycling fun. In 
a recent event in Wean Commons in
the University Center, students aimed 
their cans and plastic bottles at a bas­
ketball hoop, which is available from 
the school to departments or residence 
halls. The hope is to support awareness 
of the competition.
This year’s event coordinators at 
each university are going beyond put­
ting up posters to advertise the cause.
In efforts to use technology, coordi­
nators have been invited to join a spe­
cial webinar on how to use MySpace 
and Facebook websites to promote the 
competition to their campus communi­
ties.
With the amount of participants in­
creasing each year, the RecycleMania 
initiative aims to ultimately raise 
awareness about the importance of re­
cycling.
For more detailed information on 
RecycleMania, see Sci-Tech page A6.
Researchers work with FOX Sports
Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment 
Technology Center (ETC) has made it 
possible to engage in a virtual inter­
view with NASCAR race analysts Darrell 
Waltrip and Larry McReyiiolds, and stu­
dio analyst Jeff Hammond.
With just a click of the mouse, NASCAR 
fans can hear and see these experts an­
swer questions.
Developed with the help of faculty ad­
visor Scott Stevens and Carnegie Mellon 
researcher Michael Christel and in part­
nership with FOX Sports and FOXSports. 
com, the technology is already available 
to the general public.
After logging on, users can choose 
one of the three analysts and ask him 
questions about NASCAR racing by click­
ing on the questions from a menu or 
by typing their own. The responses are 
pre-recorded answers of the individuals 
speaking, simulating a live conversation.
The technology behind the interviews 
allows each question to be tied to one of 
hundreds of responses, wliich is replayed 
for users with similar queries. Users can 
ask questions in whichever order they 
choose in addition to creating their own 
questions, which allows each interview 
to be one of a kind.
Created in celebration of the Daytona 
500 race’s 50th anniversary, the virtual 
interviews will continue to evolve as FOX 
Sports and FOXSports.com work with 
the ETC.

Washington Post expands business 
to higher education investments
POST, from A1
preparation company designed 
tobooststandardizedtestscores. 
According to the December 2007 
issue of Washingtonian maga­
zine, Kaplan recently brought in
50.3 percent of the company’s 
revenue while the newspaper 
division only accounted for 21 
percent of profits.
The Post’s move then, is not 
only a reflection of the decreas­
ing popularity of printed forms 
of news, but also an indication 
of the battle between the por­
trayal of universities as non- 
profitable, charitable institu­
tions and as systems that can 
provide a tidy profit.
Professor Jeffrey Williams of 
the Tepper School of Business 
viewed the Post’s transition as a 
logical move for a company that 
“manages information as it is 
moving into an industry where 
it can be used."
Williams noted that the in­
creasing number of Americans 
acquiring college degrees is an 
additional fact that can be used 
to the corporation’s advantage.
According to some professors 
however, the increased inter­
est in higher education as a 
money-making institution 
could very well bring an end 
to the diversity which exists 
among colleges nationwide in 
terms of the specializations, at­
mosphere, and unique qualities 
that each provides.
“If universities follow the cor­
porate model, they will shrink 
that diversity,” said English 
professor Jeffrey Williams (not 
related to the former Jeffrey 
Williams).
However, Williams brought 
up the fact that this relationship 
is one of necessity since news­
paper readership, especially 
among some of the younger 
age groups, is virtually nonex­
istent.
Williams also predicted that 
the relationship between the 
student and the institution will 
be reduced to that between a 
consumer and a business in 
which customers “pay money 
and get a service in return.” 
This in turn could eliminate the 
inclination which students have 
to later donate money back to 
the school as alumni.
The growing link between 
business and education has also
been integrated into the virtual 
world with services such as the 
University of Phoenix Online, 
which offers classes and de­
grees in health care, business, 
technology, and education.
Business professor Williams 
acknowledged that the develop­
ment in this sector could “po­
tentially be a threat to second 
and third tier institutions,” as 
they have less resources than 
highly-ranked private and re­
search universities.
Williams also believes how­
ever that even institutions such 
as Carnegie Mellon with the pri­
mary goal of research “would 
be pressured to differentiate 
themselves as more than just a 
commodity.”
The relationship between 
schools, corporations, and 
online institutions will con­
tinue to be closely followed by 
both business leaders and the 
academic community at large. 
Moves such as the one made by 
The Washington Post illustrate 
the changing relationship be­
tween the corporate world and 
academia, the final nature of 
which has yet to be decided.

Sustainable Earth Symposium
Dr. Cliff Davidson, professor of civil and environmental engineering and engineering and public policy,

on the changing nature of engineering and the immediate need to address sustainability. The sympo­
sium was part of the E-Week (Engineering Week) events.
Annual MOSAIC conference discusses gender issues in changing society
Allison Piper/Assistant Photo Editor
This year’s sessions addressed a variety of topics, such as the Contraceptive 
Petting Zoo (shown above) in which students were provided with an under­
standing of the politics behind contraceptives as well as the health effects.
MOSAIC, fromAl
participated in speed dating.
The session “What you Will or 
Goethe’s Curse” even featured 
live streaming video to the Car­
negie Mellon-Qatar campus in 
discussion of specified gender be­
havior as seen in everyday actions 
such as speech, movement, and 
thinking.
Some of this year’s sessions par­
ticularly stuck out for students.
Allison Stone, a sophomore his­
tory major, spoke about the “What 
is Masculinity?” session.
“I really liked that it was inter­
active,” she said. “We were given 
the rolQ of men from different 
time periods, such as medieval, 
renaissance, and modern, then 
asked to act them out in a skit. We 
discussed afterwards what it re­
ally means to be a man.”
“The objective of MOSAIC is to 
offer provocative sessions aimed
at exploring gender constructions 
in Unconventional ways. To that 
end, the committee works to carve 
out a conference that responds to 
the intersection of gender with 
notions of difference,” Cinkovic 
said.
Cinkovic also noted that the di­
versity of the programs available 
is what makes MOSAIC so inter­
esting each year.
“As its name implies, the MO­
SAIC conference aspires to con­
nect the many fragments, or 
voices, into a collective dialogue,” 
Cinkovic said. “We seek to open 
multiple ways of seeing while cel­
ebrating our common objectives 
of creating inclusive and equitable 
communities. The committee has 
worked hard to bring programs 
that would appeal to both men 
and women on campus and in the 
community.”
The MOSAIC committee began 
preparing for the event in Sep­
tember, which included creating 
sessions and promoting the con­
ference.
Kaylie Thompson, a senior 
chemistry major and MOSAIC 
committee member, spoke of the 
importance of choosing topics for 
each year’s events.
“In order to get a good keynote 
speaker and presenters for the 
sessions, it is important to brain­
storm early about what types of 
gender issues you think are most 
important and interesting to ad­
dress,” Thompson said.
“MOSAIC is important because 
it is the one large-scale gender 
conference that Carnegie Mellon 
does every year, and it is so im­
portant to recognize that gender 
is still a salient issue in our soci­
ety. Not even necessarily action, 
but awareness of the issues, can 
make such a huge difference.”
Cinkovic mentioned that events 
in the past have been very success­
ful with great feedback from both 
the students and faculty members 
who participated.
“MOSAIC is always well re­
ceived at Carnegie Mellon. Both 
students and faculty enjoy at­
tending this conference and truly 
add the dynamic of MOSAIC,” 
Cinkovic said.
Each year, students fill out sur­
veys evaluating current programs 
and making future requests.
Thompson spoke of the wide 
variety of people that attend MO­
SAIC and to whom the issues ap­
ply.
“A lot of people that did not nec­
essarily think they would come to 
the conference, but were encour­
aged to, ended up really learning 
and enjoying it,” Thompson said.
“And this year, the conference 
is more focused on men’s issues 
than it ever has been, so hopefully 
we’ll get a good mix of the sexes 
at MOSAIC this year,” she said.
Resignation of William and Mary 
president causes chaos on campus
RESIGN, fromAl
out his contract wasn’t being re­
newed he picked up and left us 
all in the dust,” Tedesco said.
The university’s student body 
president, Zach Pilchen, is­
sued an e-mail statement to the 
college on the day of Nichol’s 
resignation.
“We are particularly ashamed 
of the way the Board of Visitors 
handled the situation,” Pilchen 
wrote, ending his e-mail with “As 
we said before: Gene Ray Nichol 
will always be our president.”
Rector Michael Powell, the 
head of the Board of Visitors, ex­
plained the reasoning behind not 
renewing Nichol’s contract after 
his three-year term in a Feb. 12 
e-mail to the college.
“The Board believed there 
were a number of problems 
that were keeping the College 
from reaching its full potential 
and concluded that those issues 
could not be effectively remedied 
without a change in leadership,” 
he wrote.
The “issues” Powell speaks 
of include several campus con­
troversies that occurred in the 
past three years of Nichol’s presi­
dency. The first of these was the 
Wren Cross controversy, in which 
Nichol removed a Christian cross 
from the main room of the Wren 
Chapel on campus in an effort to 
accommodate other religions.
Nichol’s reluctance to ban con­
troversial programs funded by 
students has also been a point 
of contention for the college. 
For the past three years, for ex­
ample, Nichol has allowed a cen­
sored version of what is known 
as the “Sex Workers’ Art Show,” 
featuring monologues and per­
formances by strippers, homo­
sexual prostitutes, and other 
sex workers, to be shown at the 
school.
“It would have been a know­
ing, intentional denial of the 
constitutional rights of our stu­
dent!;,” Nichol said in anVmail
to the college on the day of his 
resignation, regarding his move 
to not ban the show.
According to Tedesco, Nichol’s 
liberal policies have denied the 
school millions of dollars from 
alumni, who are generally more 
conservative.
However, the Board did ap­
plaud a few of Nichol’s policies.
They praised him for his ef­
forts at diversifying the college 
through more varied applicant 
pools for student, faculty, and 
staff positions, as well as ag­
gressive financial aid policies to 
accommodate needy students.
Yet the negative aspects of 
Nichol’s presidency outweighed 
the positive ones when the Board 
ultimately made the decision not 
to renew his contract.
“We are particularly 
ashamed of the way the 
Board of Visitors handled 
the situation.”
— Zach Pilchen
The manner in which the 
Board made the decision was 
not without controversy itself. 
According to Mendez, the Board 
had hired a consulting firm to 
investigate Nichol, of which the 
faculty was not aware until Nich- 
ol’s resignation.
“The Board offered both me 
and my wife substantial eco­
nomic incentives if we would 
agree ‘not to characterize [the 
decision] as based on ideologi­
cal grounds’ or make any other 
statement about my departure 
without their approval,” Nichol 
wrote in the e-mail.
Nichol also wrote of the people 
behind this decision. According 
to Nichol, the Virginia House of 
Delegates had been threatening 
the Board about the security of 
their ownv appointments, based
particularly on the Wren cross 
and sex show scandals.
As a public university, William 
and Mary’s campus is owned by 
the state and state funding is 
provided. However, as Mendez 
noted and according to univer­
sity data, state funding accounts 
for only 17 percent of the univer­
sity’s total funding.
Mendez also noted that a 
group of wealthy, conservative 
alumni had a considerable role 
in influencing Board opinions. 
She insisted that the issue was 
more than public-versus-private 
institutions and asked, “What’s 
the role of dollars in all this?”
Yet despite the small amount of 
funding it receives from the state, 
William and Mary remains a 
chartered public institution, with 
its board members appointed by 
the House of Delegates.
A private institution such as 
Carnegie Mellon cannot be di­
rectly influenced by the state. 
However, in a previous inter­
view, Carnegie Mellon President 
Jared L. Cohon noted that the 
role of a university president 
may be becoming increasingly 
political.
“More boards are looking 
to people [for university presi­
dents] who have experiences in 
state political and management 
roles,” Cohon said.
The controversy at William 
and Mary remains far from over. 
In light of Nichol’s resignation, 
a board member has resigned, 
faculty members have resigned 
from committees, such as the 
diversity committee and an in­
terim president was immediately 
instated, to the surprise of the 
college community.
Editor’s Note: The e-mails to the 
College of William and Mary were

Survey shows that AP scores and 
exam participation increasing
SCORE, fromAl
scores on the SAT exam.
However, professors had mixed feelings as to 
whether first-year students have become more 
prepared for college classes with the rise of AP ex­
ams.
At Carnegie Mellon, there are several classes in 
which AP credit is possible.
Interpretation and Argument is one such class 
specifically designed as a requirement for all first- 
year students.
If first-years receive a 5 on the AP English exam, 
they receive credit for the class. With any other 
score or no credit, they are required to complete it.
Several of the Interpretation and Argument in­
structors mentioned that they haven’t noticed a 
significant change in student preparedness over 
the past couple of years.
“In terms of basic writing skills, students are per­
haps better at the technical aspects of writing, but 
not the larger, ‘meta’ levels of argumentation,” said 
Eric Vasquez, an instructor for the course.
In terms of the English AP course and exam, 
Vasquez did not feel that it was necessarily a predi- 
cator of college success that it should not replace 
the required Interpretation and Argument.
Heather Steffen, another instructor, agreed with 
Vasquez and explained that AP English classes and 
the exam are more geared towards literature and
creative writing, not actual academic argument.
“From my experience, the students who have 
taken AP classes and the test are just as unfamiliar 
with academic arguments and how to make them 
as the students who took regular high school Eng­
lish classes,” she said.
First-year civil engineering major Carolyn John­
son expressed her opinion that AP classes assist 
students in predicting how difficult college classes 
are going to be.
“Going through an entire year in a college set­
ting is as close as you can get to the real thing,” 
Johnson said of her AP English course.
However, while AP work helps some students 
with the difficulty of work, the amount of work is a 
different story..
“I definitely do not feel like they helped me in 
any way to prepare for the workload at CMU,” said 
Alyssa Sellitti, a first-year H&SS student.
Carnegie Mellon offers credit for most classes for 
AP scores of four or higher.
Preparedness aside, some students are just ex­
cited by the prospect of simply getting a head start 
on college credits.
“I took seven APs,” first-year Science and Hu­
manities Scholar Adam Rice said. “The tests them­
selves didn’t do a whole lot to prepare for CMU, 
but they gave me a lot of credit so I can take less 
classes.”

THE TARTAN FEBRUARY 25, 2008 THETARTAN.ORG/NEWS
Professor John “Jack” Rein- 
ecke Thorne died Feb. 13 at 
the age of 81 while vacation­
ing with his wife, Helen, in the 
Cayman Islands. Thorne was 
a key founder of the entrepre­
neurship program at the Tepper 
School of Business and served 
as the David T. and Lindsay J. 
Morgenthaler Emeritus Profes­
sor of Entrepreneurship until 
2005.
Thorne, born March 25, 
1926, was a Pittsburgh native 
and a pioneer in the teaching of 
entrepreneurship. After gradu­
ating with the first class of Car­
negie Mellon’s Graduate School 
of Industrial Administration 
(GSIA), Thorne moved to Cali­
fornia to work for the computer 
software company Litton, and 
then started his own computer 
hardware company, Scionics. In 
1972, Richard Cyert, then the 
dean of GSIA, asked Thorne to 
return to teach a course in en­
trepreneurship, according to 
the Carnegie Mellon website.
“Jack Thorne was a pioneer in 
the teaching of entrepreneur­
ship at the university level, and 
helped to define the standard 
curriculum for that discipline. 
His influence spread far be­
yond Carnegie Mellon and 
is now global in scope,” said 
Thomas Emerson, the current 
holder of the David T. and Lind­
say J. Morgenthaler Chair in 
Entrepreneurship.
Thorne’s passion for entrepre­
neurship was apparent not only 
through his teaching, but also 
through the local programs that 
he started to work with entre­
preneurs in Pittsburgh. Thorne 
was the director of the Donald 
H. Jones Center for Entrepre­
neurship at Carnegie Mellon, 
and he formed the Enterprise 
Corporation for entrepreneurs 
in Pittsburgh, which eventually 
merged into Innovation Works, 
a local economic group that 
helps to support entrepreneur­
ial growth, according to The 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
“Jack was a pioneer in educat­
ing entrepreneurs at Carnegie 
Mellon and also in building an 
infrastructure in the commu­
nity and the university to sup­
port entrepreneurial education 
and growth,” said Arthur A. 
Boni, director of the Donald H. 
Jones Center for Entrepreneur­
ship and also the John R. Thorne 
Chair of Entrepreneurship at 
the Tepper School of Business. 
“He was able to assemble a team 
and a loyal group of supporters 
necessary to turn his vision into 
reality.”
In addition to being able to gar­
ner support to turn his visions 
into reality, Thorne was also 
skilled in getting the funds nec­
essary for his many projects. He 
secured a $1 million donation 
from Donald H. Jones and from 
David T. and Lindsay J. Morgen­
thaler to form the Donald H.

Gates spoke not only on changes in technology and computer software in recent years, but of the far-reaching effects these advances could 
have in the developing world. He hopes to promote the application of these advances to education, development, and public health among 
the world’s most underprivileged population through his full-time work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
GATES, fromAl
the college level, not just for top 
tier institutions like Carnegie 
Mellon, but also for community 
colleges and high schools.
“Take the intro biology course 
[for example]. Should they take 
Nowicki, who is a brilliant biol­
ogy lecturer at Duke, and just 
have his lectures play and then 
the people they hire are good at 
the discussion group, not trying 
to do what he does? I think there 
will be a change there,” Gates 
said.
The developing world
Gates devoted much of his time 
to discussing how the world’s 
poor will experience these tech­
nological advances. Dividing 
the world into thirds based on 
income, he argued that software 
has the ability to dramatically 
improve the lives of the poor­
est third, about 2 billion people, 
though work in behalf of this 
group is often unprofitable for 
the companies behind it.
“The market directs itself to 
solve problems based on eco­
nomic signals,” Gates said, “and 
the top 2 billion [people in the 
world] can send very strong eco­
nomic signals.”
Through the Gates Founda­
tion, Gates plans to commit 
himself to promoting the appli­
cation of technology to problems 
of education, development, and 
public health among the world’s 
poorest inhabitants. -
“I left the university without 
any awareness of the conditions 
of the poorest 2 billion,” Gates 
said. “I didn’t really understand 
the trap that exists and the na­
ture of those problems.”
Gates encouraged students to 
be aware of both problems and 
successes in the lowest 2 billion, 
using worldwide eradication of
malaria as one such example of 
the success that future genera­
tions of computer scientists can 
help facilitate. Embedding these 
examples in the curriculum may 
require further dedication to 
hands-on learning.
“What you really want to do 
is take a few problems and have 
the student go in depth and have 
them understand that one prob­
lem,” Gates later said in a press 
conference after the lecture. 
“Designing a curriculum that 
can have that broad exposure is 
not an easy thing.”
Carnegie Mellon and Micro­
soft
Both the lecture in Rangos 
and the simulcast in McConomy 
were filled to capacity with stu­
dents, staff, and faculty eager to 
hear the software legend. Tick­
ets to the lecture were in such 
high demand that some students
started camping out in the UC on 
Wednesday night.
Carnegie Mellon was the last 
stop on Gates’ tour of five univer­
sities, and the school has a numer­
ous ties to both Microsoft and the 
Gates Foundation. The company 
has recruited 57 Carnegie Mel­
lon students and funds numerous 
prizes and research fellowships. 
Gates personally sponsors 12 
Millennium Scholars at Carnegie 
Mellon and, in 2004, donated 
$20 million for the Gates Center 
for Computer Science, currently 
under construction.
“Carnegie Mellon has made 
huge contributions to computer 
science overall, and Microsoft 
has had a great relationship [with 
the university],” Gates said. “We s 
get great students. Great collab­
orative research goes on. Helping 
the university to do more seems 
very fitting.”

million donation from Gerald E. 
McGinnis to form the McGinnis 
Chair in Entrepreneurship and 
to endow the McGinnis Venture 
Competition at Carnegie Mel­
lon, according to the Carnegie 
Mellon website.
“Jack was successful since he 
lived what he taught his stu­
dents — have a vision and be 
perseverant in pursuit of that 
vision even though you may 
face rejection,” Boni said.
Thorne was not only a suc­
cessful entrepreneur, but also 
someone who genuinely felt 
passionate about what he did 
and shared that passion with all 
of his students.
“I remember traveling with 
Jack several years ago to Cali­
fornia for several events with 
Tepper alumni,” said Steve 
Sharratt, associate dean of ad­
vancement at the Tepper School 
of Business. “I’ve worked in 
higher education for about 20 
years, and I have never expe­
rienced such an outpouring 
of affection and gratitude to­
wards a former teacher than our 
alumni felt for Jack.
“Alumni felt that Jack had 
changed their lives, giving them 
the encouragement and tools 
they needed to launch busi­
nesses and careers. Jack was a 
gifted teacher, but more than 
that, he really cared passion­
ately about his students.”
About three years ago, one 
of Thorne’s former students, 
Sarosh D. Kumana, now the 
president of Pacific Investment 
Properties in San Francisco, 
donated a statue in Thorne’s 
honor that now stands on dis­
play on the first floor of Posner 
Hall. The statue is called “The 
Self-Made Man” — a man who 
is carving his own body out of a 
block of stone.
“This is the gift Jack left his 
students — the ability to carve 
out their own destiny, to make 
great careers for themselves,” 
Sharratt said.
Thorne was also active in his 
local community, serving on 
the boards of the Ligonier Fel­
lowship Committee as well as 
the Powdermill Nature Reserve 
Committee. He also assisted 
his first wife, Barbara, in form­
ing the Unitarian Universalist 
Church in Pittsburgh.

Diet supplements 
involve risks
Probiotics—diet supplements 
that promise complete and 
balanced nutrition — may 
damage, rather than enhance, 
human health.
According to a study 
published in The Lancet, 296 
pancreatitis patients were divid­
ed into two groups, one placed 
on probiotics and the other on 
similar-looking placebos. During 
the study, the other aspects of 
treatment were controlled for 
both groups of patients.
Of those on probiotics, 31 
percent needed intensive care, 
while only 24 percent of the 
patients on placebos required it.
Furthermore, 18 percent 
of those on probiotics needed 
surgery. These results showed 
that individuals on probiotics or 
other such supplements derived 
from bacteria and yeast are less 
likely to recover if suffering 
from an illness than those who 
are not on any probiotics.

Math treats cancer
Dr. Roman Polyak of George 
Mason University has discovered 
a cure to cancer by the means of 
abstract mathematics.
Polyak’s nonlinear rescaling 
theory, which involves using 
complex optimization methods 
to solve technological prob­
lems, has been altered and 
implemented by German sci­
entists Rembert Reemtsen and 
Markus Alber to make radiation 
more effective in treating can­
cer.
The method is able to solve 
large-scale problems that 
involve nearly 5000 variables 
and 200,000 constraints. The 
angles, intensity, and time-span 
of radiation rays are estimated 
through optimization. This helps 
attack tumors without harming 
the healthy tissue around it.

Radioactive lenses 
tell birth year
Scientists are able to 
accurately calculate a person’s 
birth year by measuring the 
radioactive carbon-14 naturally 
contained in the lens of the eye.
Transparent proteins called 
lens crystallines admit light into 
the retina. Carbon-14, a con­
stituent of most of the food a 
person eats, merges with the 
crystallines.
This process allows scientists 
to use radiocarbon dating to 
determine a patient’s birth year.
Niels Lynnerup of the 
University of Copenhagen and 
Henrik Kjaeldsen of Aarhus 
University assessed birth years 
by examining the carbon-14 
in 13 pairs of lenses using a 
nuclear particle accelerator.

CMU competes in RecycleManiaSciTechBriefs
A variety of recycle bins sit in the University Center.

Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon University is 
participating in the RecycleMania 
competition this year, which is 
bigger in 2008 than ever before. 
The 10-week competition began 
on Feb. 6.
During RecycleMania, partic­
ipating schools collect data on 
the amount of recyclables and 
trash collected each week and
engage in friendly competition 
to encourage recycling and waste 
reduction.
According to www.recyclem- 
aniacs.org, schools compete in 
four categories: largest amount 
of recyclables per capita, largest 
amount of total recyclables, least 
amount of trash per capita, and 
highest recycling rate.
The school with the largest 
amount of total recyclables'wins 
the Gorilla Prize, and the school
Glenn Stroz/Photo Staff
with the highest recycling, rate 
will be declared Grand Champion. 
The recycling rate is calculated by 
dividing the weight of recyclables 
by the weight of trash and recy­
clables and multiplying the result 
by 100.
Three weeks into the competi­
tion, Carnegie Mellon has a recy­
cling rate of about 18 percent, 
according to results published 
at www.recyclemaniacs.org. 
That puts the university about
two percent ahead of where it 
was after three weeks of com­
petition a year ago. But it’s still 
behind Yale, Harvard, Stanford, 
and Princeton, which are posting 
19.5, 28, 29.9, and 31 percent 
respectively.
In addition to fierce competi­
tion, changes are in order for this 
year’s competition.
Barbara Kviz, environmen­
tal coordinator in Facilities 
Management Services, said 
one of the major changes to 
RecycleMania this year is the 
number of schools participating. 
It’s doubled since last year — 
jumping from 200 to 400.
And the way schools are 
matched up has changed, too.
“This year we have changed the 
way the schools compete against 
each other,” RecycleMania co­
founder Edward Newman said. 
“ ‘Whole’ schools are compet­
ing against ‘whole’ schools, and 
‘partial’ schools are competing 
against ‘partial’ schools.”
A “whole” school is one that’s 
willing to submit data from all of 
its buildings, including auxilia­
ries and satellite facilities, while 
a “partial” school submits data 
for only a few specific buildings, 
such as residence halls.
Carnegie Mellon is competing 
as a “whole” school.

How Things Work: Tsunamis
Translated to “harbor wave” in English, tsunamis can tower over 100 feet high.
RBREBTeR aROSWR
Asst. SciTech Editor
Standing at the edge of the 
beach watching the waves crash 
into the sand is a wonderful feel­
ing, but not if those waves are 
more than 100 feet high and gush 
violently. In this case, onlook­
ers can only see a shimmering 
wall before the waves crash down 
destroying everything in their 
path. That is a tsunami.
In Japanese, “tsu” translates 
into “harbor” and “nami” means 
“wave,” giving birth to the term 
“tsunami,” which translates into 
“harbor waves.” A tsunamis is a 
series of huge waves that are usu­
ally 100 to 115 feet in height near 
the coastline.
Normal oceanic waves are 
formed due to the gravitational 
pull exerted on the earth by the 
moon.
Tsunamis, on the other hand, 
are caused due to oceanic 
disturbances like earthquakes, 
volcanoes, or underwater 
landslides. While underwater 
landslides do not cause devastat­
ing tsunamis like the one that 
hit Southeast Asia in 2004, with 
earthquakes and underwater 
volcanoes it’s a whole different 
story.
On Dec. 26,2004, an underwa­
ter earthquake measuring around
9.0 on the Richter scale origi­
nated about 100 miles away from 
Sumatra, an island of Indonesia.
According to the Guardian, the 
aftereffects of the natural disaster 
claimed nearly 230,000 lives and
spanned 12 countries, including 
Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and India.
This is the most recent exam­
ple of the devastating effects of 
a tsunami. Yet, tsunamis have a 
long history of wrecking havoc in 
different parts of the world.
It is hard to imagine that an 
earthquake in the middle of 
the ocean can cause such large- 
scale destruction miles away. 
However, looking at the mecha­
nism through which the tsunami 
waves propagate, the results do 
not seem so surprising.
The outer crust of the earth 
is divided into sections called 
tectonic plates. The layer of the 
earth directly below these tecton­
ic plates is not completely solid. 
Therefore, the tectonic plates 
tend to move slightly on the semi­
solid layer. Earthquakes usually 
originate at the boundaries of the 
tectonic plates of the earth.
Tsunamis are caused due to 
earthquakes at regions of the 
ocean bed called subduction 
zones. In subduction zones, two 
tectonic plates exert tremen­
dous forces on each other at the 
boundaries; one plate tends to 
push down on the other.
The two plates resemble pieces 
of paper overlapping and push­
ing against each other. When one 
piece pushes down on the other, 
the other piece folds.
Tectonic plates follow a similar 
process. As a result, the ocean 
bed forms atop the folded plate.
However, if the plates continue 
to push against each other, at 
some point the folded plate will
not be able to withstand the ten­
sion and will spring out of the 
folded position. When the plate 
springs out, it causes the ocean 
bed to tilt and the water to rise, 
leading to a tsunami.
Similar displacement of water 
occurs during huge underwater 
explosions like volcanoes.
It may be surprising to learn 
that the tsunami that crashes on 
the shore is not a single wave, but 
a combination of smaller waves. 
The waves that are set up in the 
ocean are actually around three 
to six feet high, though the waves 
that strike the coastline can even 
be 100 or 160 feet high.
The large difference between 
the waves near the coast and 
those in the middle of the ocean 
is due to the mechanism by which 
the waves travel away from the 
origin.
The waves travel at high speeds 
from the origin, then slow down 
as they approach the coast. Thus, 
each wave is usually moving 
slower than the waves behind it.
The waves collide with each 
other and combine into one, 
increasing each other’s ampli­
tude. The result is that a wave 
which was originally of moderate 
size is now gigantic.
If civilization happens to be on 
a coast where this wave crashes, 
there is virtually no hope of sur­
vival. The tsunami that struck 
Southeast Asia in 2004 demon­
strates this fact.
Although a number of tour­
ists in the Sri Lankan wild,life 
park lost their lives because of the
tsunami, reports from the park 
indicated that no animal casual­
ties occurred. The animals ran to 
a higher ground well before the 
fatal waves struck the land.
Massive vibrations, called 
“Rayleigh waves” are sent out 
from the origin of the earth­
quake before a tsunami occurs. 
These waves move through 
the ground at speeds 10 times 
the speed of sound. Therefore, 
they reach the land a long time 
before the tsunami waves do. 
Rayleigh waves also have large 
wavelengths and are a type of 
infrasound wave.
Animals are likely to sense the 
infrasound waves and run away 
from them to a higher ground, 
which is what happened in the 
Sri Lankan park.
Humans also have infrasound 
sensors called pacinian cor­
puscles in their joints. These 
sensors are designed specifically 
to feel such waves, but since the 
human brain has to store much 
more information, it becomes 
insensitive to signals sent by the 
corpuscles.
Having said that, what con­
tradicts this theory is that tribes 
in the Andaman Islands of India 
were able to sense the tsunami 
before it hit and thus found shel­
ter on higher ground.
The only other way that 
humans can detect a tsunami is 
seismic technology. Seismologists 
use radars to detect disturbances 
in the ocean and seismographs 
to detect earthquakes. (Scientists 
also send satellites to monitor
‘VirtuaF border goes 
up and running
A “virtual” fence consisting 
of sensor towers and advanced 
mobile communications has 
gone live on a 28-mile stretch 
of border separating the United 
States and Mexico. The fence, 
built near Nogales, Ariz., by 
Boeing, was delayed since its 
original launch date of 2007 by 
software problems.
Border Patrol agents report 
that the fence produces actual 
results in finding and allowing 
the capture of illegal immigrants 
and smugglers, said Homeland 
Security Secretary Michael 
Chertoff during a follow-up on 
border-control efforts.
An estimated $20 million 
has already gone into funding 
for this stretch alone, and last 
month, President Bush asked 
Congress for an additional $775 
million to continue construction 
of surveillance equipment along 
the border.

Arizona hosts 
largest solar plant
Abengoa Solar, a Spanish 
power company, is planning to 
construct a three square-mile 
large solar power plant in Gila 
Bend, Ariz., a small town 50 
miles southeast of Phoenix.
The plant, named The Solana 
Generating Station, is projected 
to begin construction next year 
and could begin power produc­
tion as early as 2011. Solana 
will produce 280 megawatts of 
power, enough to power over
70,000 homes.
Unlike conventional solar 
power plants, Solana harnesses 
heat from the sun rather than 
light as its source4 of power. 
The heat is used to warm liq­
uids, which will then spin tur­
bines and generate electric­
ity. According to Abengoa CEO 
Santiago Seage, this will allow 
the plant to continue produc­
ing power even after the sun 
has set.

Scientists measure 
force to push atom
Scientists at IBM have recently 
measured the amount of energy 
required to push single atoms 
along surfaces.
Approximately one 1600-mil- 
lionth of an ounce of force is 
required to push a cobalt atom 
along a smooth copper surface. 
Up to 12 times more force is 
required to push the same atom 
along an aluminum surface, IBM 
researchers reported.
Single atoms fall into small 
indentations in the surface lat­
tice structure, and significant 
force is required to push each 
of them out of an indentation 
and into the next. When mea­
sured on a larger scale, these 
atomic forces contribute to fric­
tion. This information may help 
scientists form electrical compo­
nents from a single atom.

Glaciers approach 
sea
A group of glaciers in west 
Antarctica spanning roughly 
the area of Texas is picking up 
speed as it flows toward the sea, 
British scientists report.
Scientists from the recently 
returned British Antarctic sur­
vey are alarmed by the rate at 
which these glaciers are accel­
erating. This rate has increased 
by 7 percent within the last sea­
son alone. This may be due to 
deep ocean currents eroding the 
glacier and underground geo­
thermal activity.
If the entire group of glaciers 
melts, it could potentially raise 
sea levels worldwide by as much 
as five feet.

Findings: Rethinking synthetic cells
DNA is composed of a string of 
nucleotides, and each nucleotide 
can be thought of as a letter in 
a twisting, coiling sequence of 
code. Compared to human DNA, 
the genome of M. genitalium 
contains a scant 580,000 nucle­
otides. This makes it feasible to 
remove genes, one at a time, and 
see which are integral for sur­
vival and which are not.
Working alongside Glass at 
the Venter Institute is Hamilton 
Smith. Smith won the 1978 Nobel 
Prize in Physiology or Medicine 
and, in 1995, helped sequence 
the first bacterial genome. Smith 
and Glass have been knocking 
out genes in M. genitalium, in the 
hopes of creating an ultra-basic, 
working-class piece of genomic 
DNA, for nine years.
The team is trying to find genes 
critical for the survival of M. geni-
— one that they do not have com­
plete jurisdiction over because 
the functions of a fifth of M. geni- 
talium's genes are unknown.
Foster is one of a number sci­
entists actively involved in a sec­
ond approach to building syn­
thetic cells. His method involves 
piecing cells together entirely 
from scratch. The method allows 
scientists to become intimately 
acquainted with every molecule 
comprising a living cell and is 
probably the closest approxima­
tion to synthesizing life from 
nothing.
One of the biggest hindrances 
to building synthetic cells (using 
either approach) is tackling the 
ribosome. Ribosomes are compli­
cated cellular machines respon­
sible for churning out proteins 
from strands of messenger RNA. 
They are big, unwieldy mol­
ecules that consist of more than 
50 proteins and thousands of 
RNA nucleotides. Piecing togeth­
er DNA fragments that produce 
functional ribosomes — or build­
ing ribosomes from scratch — is 
a daunting task.
In 2004, Albert Libchaber of 
Rockefeller University took a 
gene for green fluorescent pro­
tein, collected some cellular 
machinery, and threw the whole 
bit inside a circle of lipid mem­
brane proteins. The result was a 
blob that fluoresced green.
This leads to all sorts of inter­
esting thought experiments, like 
taking the gene for hair color and 
the gene for Solanum lycopersi- 
cum and seeing if you can get a 
blond tomato. More important­
ly, research in synthetic biology 
poses the interesting idea that 
cells may be able to arise from 
nothing — an idea that imme­
diately draws parallels to early 
Earth.
IfM. genitalium, one of the sim­
plest bacteria on Earth, contains
580,000 genes, one may wonder 
whether it is possible for cells to 
contain 60 genes. Their origin- 
and assembling also remains a 
mystery.
For now, the fledgling biolo­
gist can be safely chastised for 
getting the third and final tenet 
of cell biology wrong. Scientists 
have a long way to go before 
Synthia, or any other laboratory- 
engineered cell, will sputter and 
spark to life. Rudolf Virchow, 
who famously championed that

ago, may not have to worry about 
the rewriting of history just^yet.
then you have a system whereby you can simply add 
your dye to a living cell that contains a genetically 
engineered component,” he added.
FAP technology is a vast improvement from tra­
ditional methods of cell imaging because light is 
given off only when a dye is bound to the FAP. 
This eliminates background interference from free- 
floating dye molecules. The mechanism behind FAP 
technology can be understood by visualizing the 
FAP as a plastic cup bound to a string.
The string can be pinned onto any number of 
biomolecules — from cell-surface receptors for sci­
entists studying the cell membrane to intracellular 
signaling molecules.
Whether a FAP is pinned to one molecule or 
hundreds of them, it will not give off light if the 
cup is empty. Fluorescence only occurs only when 
a derivative of malachite green or thiazole orange 
enters the cup and binds there.
Malachite green and thiazole orange can be 
viewed as colorless balls with the potential to emit 
green or orange fluorescence, respectively, when 
combined with FAPs. The balls float around in solu­
tion, but are invisible unless they land in the bind­
ing pocket (or “cup”) of a FAP.

Experimentalists are often faced with the task of 
staining cells for visualization under a microscope.
There are a variety of techniques to approach 
this problem, but they all pose the similar threat 
of yielding smeared or unclear results. However, 
thanks to groundbreaking research at Carnegie 
Mellon’s Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center 
(MBIC), the process of cell imaging may have just 
taken one giant leap for biologists.
The visualization of proteins and biomolecules 
within a cell is traditionally accomplished in two 
ways. The first technique involves dyes, like mala­
chite green and coomassie blue, which bind to 
a protein of interest and change the color of the 
solution.
This provides quantitative and spatial informa­
tion about where the protein is located and how 
much of it is present in the sample. The information 
is directly proportional to the amount of dye that is 
added.
A second imaging technique involves, the use 
of fluorescence molecules — most commonly the 
green fluorescent protein, or GFP. This protein is 
extracted from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria and 
emits a brilliant green color when exposed to blue 
light.
The fluorescence can be seen under a fluorescent 
microscope. GFP is genetically expressed in various 
organisms using viral vectors, making them useful 
illuminators of specific biomolecules within cells.
However, both dyes and fluorescent molecules 
pose a nagging problem: background disturbance. 
Unbound dye molecules are visible in a sample, 
making the resulting image ambiguous and muddy. 
The fluorescence given off by fluorescent molecules 
like GFP can sometimes wash out the entire image, 
obscuring the molecule of interest.
“There are huge issues of signal to noise,” said 
Chris Szent-Gyorgyi, a researcher at the MBIC who 
headed the effort to isolate fluorogen activating 
proteins (FAPs), in reference to cell imaging. FAPs 
are fragments of antibody molecules that can be 
genetically expressed on an experimenter’s mol­
ecule of choice; they create a binding pocket for 
free-floating dye molecules. When a dye molecule 
binds to the FAP, the binding event causes it to 
fluoresce.
“If you’re going to detect 10 or 20 molecules 
inside a cell and visualize them and localize them, 
that is not a small task,” Szent-Gyorgyi said.
FAPs are a type of single-chain variable frag­
ments (scFv) composed of a full-size antibody. The 
scFvs were generated and isolated from a yeast cell 
library expressing 50,000 to 100,000 scFvs. This 
allowed scientists to specifically extract fragments 
that induced fluorescent properties in otherwise 
non-flu orescent dyes.-
The team was able to isolate two non-fluorescent 
dyes that exhibit this property of induced fluores­
cence when bound to an scFv: thiazole orange and 
malachite green.
“What you want, in this case, is a situation where 
you have a dye that finds a target in a highly specific 
way and fluoresces,” Szent-Gyorgyi said.
“If the dye is initially dark, and it does not 
interact adventitiously [randomly] with other cell 
components and provide background fluorescence,
Compared to human DNA, 
the genome of M. geni­
talium contains a scant 
580,000 nucleotides. 
This makes it feasible to 
remove genes, one at a 
timé, and see which are 
integral for survival and 
which are not.
FAP technology is a vast improvement 
from traditional methods of cell imaging 
because light is given off only when a dye 
is bound to the FAP.
Once combined, the dyes fluoresce. The unbound 
dye molecules remain dormant, resulting in a clear, 
disturbance-free image of the molecule of interest.
“One of the tricks of the trade here is working 
with dyes that do not light up adventitiously,” said 
Szent-Gyorgyi.
“There are a lot of dyes that are dark and will 
bind a lot of things non-specifically. We want things 
that will light up only when bound specifically to 
the scFv,” he said.
Conventionally, malachine green and thiazole 
orange do not fluoresce.
The breakthrough in this technique comes from 
the fact that derivatives of these dyes found by 
Szent-Gyorgyi and his team fluoresce when bound 
to a FAP.
Fluorescence is achieved when the absorbance 
of one photon by a molecule triggers the release of 
another photon with a higher wavelength.
Scientists at the MBIC screened billions of scFvs 
before finding eight that were capable of binding 
malachine green and thiazole orange and making 
them fluoresce.
“These FAPs are the essential first step in devel­
oping molecular biosensors that will monitor 
dynamic changes occurring within cells,” said Alan 
Waggoner, director of the MBIC and a biology pro­
fessor at Carnegie Mellon.
“The ultimate goal is to put molecular biosensors 
based on FAP technology inside cells. [We] have 
used the FAPs in conjunction with several fluoro- 
gens to visualize proteins at the cell surface and are 
now using the technology to image proteins inside 
cells,” Waggoner said.

done by MS.
Scientists have discovered that 
MS is closely linked to a genetic 
defect present in chromosome 6.
The presence of this defect does 
not necessarily mean that diagno­
sis of MS is inevitable, though 
studies have shown that a cor­
relation does exist between this 
chromosome and the disease.
While this knowledge may not 
help determine the cause of MS, 
it may help in the discovery of a 
cure.
Because MS attacks the ner­
vous system, symptoms vary from 
the less serious, such as loss of 
balance or blurred vision, to the 
more serious, as in the case of 
paralysis.
Symptoms vary on a case- 
by-case basis, as the symptoms 
experienced depend upon the 
area of the brain affected by the 
disease. While some patients may 
experience difficulties relating to 
muscular activity, others -experi­
ence speech problems.
The most common symptom 
of MS is fatigue, which affects 
78 percent of patients, accord­
ing to the Multiple Sclerosis 
Foundation.
Although there is no cure for 
MS, treatment is possible. There 
are two kinds of treatment: one 
aims at reducing symptoms; the 
other reduces the number and 
frequency of attacks made by the 
disease upon the nervous system.
Therapy and medication can 
both help to alleviate symptoms, 
depending upon the nature of 
those symptoms. In the case of 
fatigue, for example, patients are 
often recommended a change in
lifestyle.
The more important treatment, 
though, is to prevent the disease 
from worsening and creating new 
lesions on the brain. Medicines 
are used to slow this process and 
keep the patient from developing 
new symptoms.
These treatments may not cease 
symptoms altogether, but they 
lessen the likelihood of symptoms 
worsening.
It is important that treatment 
be started early, regardless of the 
mildness of the symptoms. Early 
treatment Could mean the differ­
ence between paralysis and full 
muscular mobility.
A frequent symptom of MS is 
acute depression, and patients 
may require guidance by a coun­
selor.
In addition to being a good 
treatment for depression, coun­
seling may benefit all those close 
to the diagnosed.
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic 
disease, meaning that it will never 
completely go away. Likewise, the 
symptoms may never vanish; they 
may worsen, stay the same, or 
even seem to disappear, but the 
possibility that they will return is 
always a reality.
There is no “typical” MS case. 
Every case is unique, and there­
fore must be handled in its own 
way. Caring for an MS patient 
involves time and understanding, 
and some cases may require more 
than others.
It is important to remember 
that MS is not fatal in most cases, 
and individuals diagnosed with 
MS may still possibly lead a 
normal life.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a dis­
ease in which a person’s immune 
system attacks his or her nervous 
system.
Approximately 400,000 
Americans suffer from MS, 
and over 2.5 million people do 
worldwide. According to a Feb. 19 
article on www.medicalnewsto- 
day.com, one out of every 750 
people is at risk for developing 
MS_
While there is no known cause 
for MS, the data suggest that cer­
tain groups are more likely to be 
affected by the disease. For exam­
ple, females and Caucasians with 
northern European heritage are 
more susceptible to the disease.
Both genetics and the environ­
ment play a role in the likelihood 
of being diagnosed with MS. An 
individual is more likely to be 
diagnosed with MS if they have 
a close family member who has 
the disease.
MS is usually diagnosed in indi­
viduals between the ages of 20 
and 50, but not through conven­
tional diagnostic means. Since 
there is no definite way to diag­
nose the disease, doctors explore 
the patient’s symptoms and medi­
cal history in an attempt to rule 
out other possible diseases before 
diagnosing a patient with MS.
If this method is unsuccessful 
in determining whether a patient 
has MS, doctors examine the 
patient’s brain using magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scan­
ning. The MRI results show the 
existence and extent of damageLizzee Solomon/Art Editor

Castro’s little lieFromTheEditorialBoardthe island closer to freedom. Castro sur­
vived his long reign as dictator by be­
coming a symbol of revolution and infus­
ing this pride in the people, speaking of 
Cubans as noble “revolutionaries” who 
stand and fight against their enemies. In­
fusing this supposed pride in the minds 
of Cubas, in addition to sending some 
into exile and scaring others into silence, 
allowed him to remain in power for so 
long. As such, this monster who has 
worked so hard to remain a totalitarian 
dictator is not likely to give up his glory 
so easily. His resignation only signals his 
intention to help support a new symbol 
of modern communist ideals, manifested 
in the image of his younger brother, Raul 
Castro, who is replacing him.
Before you can free a country, you 
have to free its people from misguided 
ideals. If these ideals live on in his 
brother, the symbol of Castro’s totalitar­
ian reign will live on as well.
Last week, some U.S. Cubans held signs 
that read “Castro’s dead” in the streets of 
Little Havana, Miami, and Hialeah, where 
large populations of U.S.-Cubans reside. 
But much to our chagrin, we all know he’s 
still very much alive. Arguably, Castro’s 
step down as dictator may be followed by 
some changes, but probably none drastic 
enough to give my family back in Cuba 
shoes, jobs, and enough food to eat.
Worst of all, Fidel Castro may actually 
get to live out his vacation by. drinking a 
Cuba Libre — a popular Cuban drink of 
cola, limk, and rum — by Cuba’s paradi­
siacal beach side. In response to the irony 
of the name of the drink, U.S residing 
Cubans have renamed it La Mentirita, or 
“The Little Lie.” Castro’s resignation is de­
ceiving in the same way. As such, Cuba is 
not free, and will not be for some time.
Fidel Castro’s name has haunted me 
since I was a child in Venezuela, fre­
quently hearing horror stories about him 
from my expatriate Cuban family. He 
was my political boogeyman, lurking in 
the shadows to arrest my freedom-loving 
parents. He was the monster who fos­
tered poverty, forcing people to wait in 
long lines for food rations. As an older 
child in Miami, the grocery store was 
like a forum; old Cuban men vehemently 
exclaimed, “The problem with Cuba is...” 
They’d shout “¡Cuba Libre!” while gestic­
ulating madly or staring off toward dis­
tant memories of a Cuban paradise.
Ex-patriots or not, a free Cuba is in all Cu­
bans’ hearts, but that reality isn’t soon coming. 
While Castro’s resignation has shone light on 
the possibility of freedom from his oppressive 
regime, this is easier said than done.
For most Cuban ex-patriots like my 
family, Castro’s Feb. 19 resignation is a 
cop-out. He’s violated every human right 
possible, and jailed many people for say­
ing even one word against his policies. He 
placed shooting ranges next to elemen­
tary schools, and even started the Union 
of Pioneers of Cuba, a youth brigade that 
teaches children to stray away from God 
(as all good Marxists should) and to in­
stead idealize Castro (as all good Cubans 
should). Even the 1978 Code of the Child 
and of Youth states that “Society and the 
State work for the efficient protection of 
youth against all influences contrary to 
their communist formation.”
Following these offensive practices, 
Castro’s resignation is not quite the end 
Cuban people, such as myself, wished to 
see. In fact, Castro’s death is what most 
freedom-loving Cubans feel would bring

Avoid conformity, make changes that suit your needs 
SiMkWri*
SARAH MOGIN
I love, love, love General Tso — 
his chicken, his tofu, and some­
times even his beef are enough to 
send me into a food coma, where 
my dreams form an excited blend 
of ecstasy, nausea, and regret.
Why regret? Well, it only takes 
one trip to www.calorieking.com 
to realize that one dish of General 
Tso’s chicken provides enough 
calories to feed a small family for 
about a week. Wow.
Knowing this, do I wish that 
my beloved general offered some 
less caloric options? Would I pre­
fer my food less fried, with less 
sauce, or just... less? (Perhaps a 
plate overflowing with chicken is, 
at times, a little over the top.)
Doubtful.
When I want to eat healthy, I eat 
healthy. Don’t even get me started 
on the deliciousness of hummus 
and pita, salad, or sushi — I’m 
there. But when I want to drown 
myself in dark meat and dark 
sauce, there’s only one man for 
me, and his name is Tso. General 
Tso. I don’t want my Chinese food 
to be more like my healthy food, 
and I don’t want my healthy food
to be more like my Chinese food.
I’ve tried the Lean Cuisine ver­
sions of the general’s oh-Tso-good 
creations, but they pale in com­
parison to their greasy restaurant 
counterparts. On top of that, they 
taste worse than most healthy 
foods do — I’d prefer a plate of 
celery to a microwavable bowl of 
rubbery chicken any day.
My point? Choices are impor­
tant, and when you mix things that 
don’t belong together, like healthy 
food and General Tso’s, you wind 
up with a less-than-appetizing 
option. When you choose some­
thing, it reflects your priorities — 
do you care about calories, pric­
es, or flavor? While some choices 
are better than others, there’s no 
perfect option — each is simply 
different from the rest.
Now, we all know that Chinese 
food is very wise — just look at 
fortune cookies — and, as such, 
I argue that we can apply this 
same choice-conscious argument 
to bigger topics, like universities.
When you choose a university, 
it also says a lot about you. For 
example, students at Carnegie 
Mellon probably don’t value 
packed football games and sunny 
weather as much as they value 
academically strenuous classes 
and a diverse student body.
To me that sounds like a fair
trade, but some people would 
hate it, which is why there are 
plenty of other colleges out there 
to choose from. Besides, no col­
legiate choice is final; students 
transfer in and out of Carnegie 
Mellon every year as they re-eval- 
uate their college decisions.
This seems obvious, but things 
get a little iffy when the thing you 
choose starts changing.
People probably wouldn’t com­
plain if the clouds parted, the 
snow melted, and students started 
tanning on the Cut, but what if our 
classes suddenly changed? What 
if Carnegie Mellon turned into a 
party school overnight, stopped 
offering computer science or musi­
cal theater, or doubled in size?
These changes wouldn’t only be 
radical; they’d be stupid, because 
schools with those characteristics 
already exist. If a student really 
wanted a party school, he or she 
would have chosen one.
For a less radical (but more 
tangible) example, think about 
the Tartans Bikes debacle from 
early 2007. Student body presi­
dent Karl Sjogren and vice presi­
dent Andrea Hamilton endowed 
our campus with unlocked bicy­
cles in order to help students 
move around campus and instill 
a feeling of good ole togetherness 
within the community. x
This idea was doomed from the 
start, mostly because Carnegie 
Mellon is not the kind of school 
to foster such touchy-feely pro­
grams. We’re big and we’re in the 
city, and unlocked bikes will (and 
did) get stolen faster than you 
can, well, paint them plaid.
Moreover, students at Carnegie 
Mellon didn’t enroll in a touchy- 
feely school for a reason — 
clearly, other things were more 
important. Perhaps some stu­
dents would have enjoyed a more 
successful bike program, but the 
majority seemed indifferent.
Now, Student Senate is propos­
ing a new set of changes that could 
go the way of the bikes: a pass/fail 
fall semester for first-years and 
+/- grading for undergrads.
There are plenty of other 
schools that already have these 
policies, especially +/- grading, 
so changing Carnegie Mellon to 
match would only be changing 
our school into something that 
current students didn’t choose.
Still, not all change is bad — the 
proposed grading changes have 
some potentially positive conse­
quences, including smooth college 
transitions for first-years (pass/ 
fail) and increased feedback from 
faculty to students (+/-).
The important distinction here 
is whether a pass/fail semester
or +/- grading would alter the 
identity of the university. Would 
they turn it into a school that 
caters less to the current student 
body? Or, are these two poli­
cies too insignificant to make 
an impact on Carnegie Mellon’s 
identity as a whole?
My personal opinion is that 
neither of these two policies 
mesh well with the current 
Carnegie Mellon identity; a 
pass/fail semester would only 
set first-years up for a shock­
ingly tough spring semester, 
and +/- grading would make 
academically crazy students go 
even academically crazier.
However, I’m not fully educat­
ed on the issue, so don’t take my 
opinion as your own. Instead, 
my point is that the question 
is not “Would the policies be 
good?” but rather “Would the 
policies be good for us?”
In the end, our agenda as 
students should be to better 
Carnegie Mellon. We chose 
it, just like I so often choose 
General Tso, and now all that’s 
left is to embrace it — in all of 
its fried, greasy glory.

A new subculture: Stage Moms and Ranting Parents
CYNTHIA PENG
Over-involved parents: You’ve 
seen them before. They’re the 
ones sitting with their makeup 
done too perfectly at PTA meet­
ings, being a little too enthusi­
astic or critical at Little League 
games, and scrutinizing their 
kid’s report card just a little bit 
too hard. They’re those parents. 
They’re out there in society, on 
the prowl for the best education, 
clothes, iPod, and pony for their 
children.
We cannot just sweep all 
of these parents into one big 
category labeled “Stage Mom,” 
though — today’s overac­
tive parent is more than the 
hairspray-wielding former pag­
eant queen we all love to hate. 
This modern-day subculture 
has evolved to include overea- 
ger parents of various forms and 
degrees. Behold the categories 
of the modern Stage Mom — 
and keep in mind that these are 
all extreme versions of parents, 
and any mother, father, or step­
parent can be any combination 
of them.
The PTA Mom. The PTA 
mom is part involved par­
ent, part businesswoman after 
her prime, and part aspiring 
pseudo-school administrator. 
She calls and presides over all 
the important meetings, but it’s 
more complicated than that.
Remember the monthly 
one-hour meetings your mother 
used to attend in the elementa­
ry school cafeteria? Those days 
are gone. What was formerly 
a mere one-hour commitment 
has turned into an all-consum- 
ing job for the PTA Mom. There 
are general meetings, board 
meetings, executive board meet­
ings, and officer meetings, along 
with conventions, luncheons,
socials with staff, and commit­
tee meetings — the whole nine 
yards.
These PTA moms live the 
American Dream, the 2.2 
beautiful children, the husband 
who takes care of the finances, 
and the prestige of holding the 
ultimate position of mommy 
power.
The Ranting Parent. The rant­
ing parent’s favorite thing to do, 
as the name suggests, is rant about 
his or her child. A conversation 
with this overbearing parent will 
frequently start out like so:
“Timmy has so much going on 
for him! I mean, he’s involved 
in so much at school, and he 
has so many responsibilities! 
He’s on the soccer team, he plays 
trumpet, he attends marching 
band rehearsals, he’s in two hon­
ors classes, he goes to football 
games, he does homework, he 
has to sleep, he has to eat, he has 
to blink... I mean, kids have so 
much going on nowadays!” (Puts 
hand to heart.) “I couldn’t imag­
ine balancing all of these things 
when I was his age!”
The ranting parent, as demon­
strated above, loves to exagger­
ate. This mother or father may 
not know the specifics of what’s 
going on in his or her child’s life, 
but loves nonetheless to point 
out how incredibly busy he or 
she is, and swell with a sense 
of unrequited pride when that 
child faithfully executes all the 
aspects of his or her supposedly 
busy existence.
Ranting parents also pos­
sess the amazing ability to rant 
without saying a word. We’ve all
Michael Menchaca/Art Staff
seen the minivan with about 20 
“My Child is an Honor Student” 
stickers cascaded across the 
back windshield —just in case it 
wasn’t clear enough already how 
special their child truly is.
The Omnipresent Parent. 
This parent is everywhere! 
Community bake sale — they’re 
there! Fundraiser for the dance 
team — they’re there! 5K Run 
(or one-mile Fun Run — we’re 
not all super-athletic) — they’re 
there! Boring band competition 
with three sleepy judges in the 
audience — that’s right, he or 
she is the fourth audience mem­
ber. While their commitment is 
to be applauded, their omnipres­
ence is unnerving.
The Vicarious Parent. The 
vicarious parent often spins ele­
gant rhetoric of what they should
have done in their “glory” 
days, and pass all that enthu­
siasm and ambition on to their 
child to carry out. The goal of 
the vicarious parent, to use a 
hackneyed phrase, is to raise an 
“overachiever” progeny and be 
with that progeny every step of 
the way as his or her child punts, 
glides, plays, dances, or sings to 
the top. His or her child’s touch­
down is the parent’s {ouch'down. 
His or her child’s sappy Good 
Citizenship Award is the parent’s 
own Good Citizenship Award.
Some vicarious parents may 
even take music or sports les­
sons with their child; it’s not too 
far of a stretch. The vicarious 
parent fails to recognize that 
Mommy-and-Me gymnastics or 
Daddy-and-Me swimming les­
sons may be cute if the child is 
three, but not once that child 
grows up. The child’s beautiful 
dreams may not align with your 
beautiful dreams. Sorry.
All of these parents are not 
necessarily “bad” parents, nor 
do they become bad parents 
if they exhibit such charac­
teristics. Parenting is hard in 
this day and age, and the line 
between “good” parenting and 
“Stage Mom” parenting is get­
ting more and more vague. As 
the difference between pushing 
a child and pushing him or her 
too hard is increasingly difficult 
to distinguish, good parenting 
is hard to define.
Perhaps Chris Rock puts it 
best: “Good parenting is keep­
ing your daughter off the pole.” 
At least that much, the majority 
of parents have done.
Cynthia Peng (cynthiap@J is 
a first-year SHS student and 
greatly enjoys writing for The 
Tartan. She plans on eventually 
becoming a Vicarious Parent and 
forcing her children to write as 
well. Then, she will corner you 
and rant about their accomplish­
ments.
Presidential
Perspectives
Practical 
change and 
collaboration
Sean Weinstock & Adi Jain
Hey Tartans,
Hope all is well in midterm 
land! If not, don’t worry—spring 
break is almost here.
This week was fairly quiet for 
Adi and myself as we regrouped 
and prepared for the last 10 
weeks of our terms in office. 
We’ve still got a pretty full slate, 
and we’ll report the play-by-play 
as the weeks progress.
I’d like to explain to you the 
general mentality we have ap­
plied throughout this year as 
your student body president and 
vice president. Our campaign fo-* 
cused on practical change, and 
we have certainly accomplished 
a lot of that. As we started taking 
steps, we realized that in order to 
make changes that will positively 
affect the day-to-day activities of 
students at Carnegie Mellon, we 
must reach out and collaborate 
both with other students and 
with faculty and staff; these peo­
ple can help create change and 
will be here long enough to see 
the lasting effects. Collaboration 
is the overarching idea behind 
much of our actions in office.
Truth be told, there’s nothing 
Adi and I do that any other ambi­
tious student couldn’t. The main 
obstacle inhibiting those other 
ambitious students is the lack of 
communication we sometimes 
experience on campus. As Presi­
dent Cohon put it two Fridays ago 
at the Presidents’ Dinner Forum, 
sometimes we see different “fief- 
doms” acting to progress their 
own interests, but what we lose 
track of is that, quite often, those 
fiefdoms want similar things. In 
my opinion, this problem results 
from the great individualism we 
see on this campus, which, while 
by no means a negative factor, 
can lead to somewhat of a segre­
gated community.
We are all driven to think for 
ourselves and outside of the 
box that we see others trapped 
within. Great things come from 
individuals outside the box. But 
could even greater things come 
from those individuals if the gaps 
between them were bridged, and 
they were able to meet and ex­
change ideas? Absolutely. But, 
how do we accomplish such a 
task? I haven’t a clue.
Even though I don’t have the 
answer right now, that doesn’t 
mean one doesn’t exist. I believe 
that to make this school a better 
place for all of us, we must allow 
ourselves to search for an answer 
rather than just assume that be­
cause there isn’t one already, we 
shouldn’t strive to find it. This 
is the challenge Adi and I have 
faced all year, and this is the 
challenge I want to bestow upon 
our successors and upon you.
Anyhow, enough with the phi­
losophy. Until next week, remem­
ber that you can always reach me 
at cmu5@cmu.edu. Good luck!

Track, field shows strong
VRPeRIW TCOAe
Junior Staffwriter
Rock climbing is hardly a 
mainstream sport, but like most 
alternative sports, there is a 
well-established community and 
culture among the participants. 
Carnegie Mellon is home to a 
small but developing grsoup of 
climbers. Even within the small
club, there is a diverse array of 
climbing interests and abilities.
The Carnegie Mellon Explorers 
Club organizes climbing 
expeditions ranging from trips 
to the gym to outdoor climbing 
to full-weekend trips to premier 
climbing spots on the East Coast. 
The current climbing chair, 
junior NecJ^Fox, an accomplished 
outdoor climber, leads most of
the climbing trips.
Fox organizes trips in and 
around Pittsburgh. This semester, 
there has been a club-sponsored 
trip to The Climbing Wall, a local 
climbing gym. According to Fox, 
these trips are a way to generate 
interest among novice climbers 
before the season starts. It is also 
a way for the advanced climbers 
to stay in sha^e between more in­
tense trips.
Fox’s goal this spring is to 
develop a larger base of climb­
ers by recruiting more students 
by advertising more and giving 
notice of trips well in advance. 
Strong leadership and proper 
preparation are two key ingredi­
ents to success that he plans on 
implementing this semester.
The Explorers Club hopes to
raise the amount of interest in 
climbing among Carnegie Mellon 
students so that more elaborate 
trips will be possible. During the 
fall semester, Fox co-led a two- 
night trip to the Red River Gorge. 
“The Red,” as it is commonly 
called, is one of the largest and 
most dramatic climbing sites on 
the East Coast. The trip consisted 
of camping out and climbing dur­
ing the day.
Tentative upcoming trips, 
which usually last a full day, in­
clude day trips to McConnell’s 
Mill, a popular beginners climb­
ing destination and also to Coo­
per’s Rocks, another climbing 
spot two hours from campus.

Men’s swimming finishes second in UAAs
SWIMMING, from A12
also earned a third place in the 
50-yard freestyle with a 24.46. 
Earlier in preliminaries, Con­
nell recorded a personal best of 
24.43, getting an NCAA “B” cut.
Other notable swims include 
first-year Briane Burton’s sixth- 
place finish in the 50-yard free­
style in 25.11 and junior Allison 
Retotar’s eighth-place finish in 
the 200-yard IM in a personal- 
best time of 2:13.47.
The 200-yard freestyle relay 
team came close to a school re­
cord with a season-best time of 
1:38.93 and a second-place fin­
ish. The 400-yard freestyle relay 
team crushed the old school re­
cord by 2.47 seconds to get third 
place in 3:58.15 and an NCAA 
“B” cut.
On Friday, the men’s team 
congratulated its first individual 
champion of the meet, sopho­
more Jeff Dahlen, who won the 
100-yard backstroke in a time 
of 52.47 and picked up an NCAA 
“B” cut. Sophomore John John­
son also participated in the finals 
heat with a fifth-place finish in a 
time of 53.38.
The 100-yard breaststroke was 
another strong event for the Tar­
tans, with sophomore Jason Hu­
ber coming in third, followed by 
juniors Brad Henderson and Ryan 
Hofler. In the preliminaries, first- 
year Alex Hanson shaved sec­
onds off his 400-yard IM time to 
get an NCAA “B” cut of 2:07.39. 
In finals, he placed sixth overall. 
Senior Patrick Snyder swam a 
career-best time of 1:43.76 and 
earned sixth in the finals for the 
200-yard freestyle. The two re­
lays for the day (200-yard med­
ley and 800-yard freestyle) both 
received NCAA “B” cuts.
The women’s team had an im­
pressive showing on Friday with 
swimmers reaching finals in all 
five individual races. The first 
individual to reach finals was se­
nior Anna Kochalko, who finished 
third overall in the 400-yard IM 
in 4:39.67. First-year Rebecca 
Ussai then placed seventh in the 
100-yard butterfly.
Connell swam in the finals 
for the 200-yard freestyle, get­
ting sixth place. Sophomore Sara 
Andrews finished third in the 
100-yard breaststroke with a ca­
reer-best time of 1:07.86. Evans
placed second in the 100-yard 
backstroke in a career-best time 
of 58:48.
The 800-yard freestyle team 
comprised of Andrews, Evans, 
Retotar, and Kochalko finished 
in third with an NCAA “B” cut of 
7:50.32.
The final day saw two new Tar­
tan UAA champions, both in the 
200-yard backstroke. Evans won 
the event in a career-best time of 
2:04.67, breaking her previous 
school record and the UAA meet 
record. Evans has already quali­
fied for NCAA championships.
The second UAA champion 
from Carnegie Mellon was 
sophomore John Johnson with a 
time of 1:53.66. Johnson was fol­
lowed by Dahlen in second place, 
and two other teammates placed 
in the finals. Both Johnson and 
Dahlen finished with NCAA “B” 
cuts.
Finishing third overall in the 
100-yard freestyle, Snyder got 
an NCAA “B” cut of 46.30 and 
earned All-UAA marks. Mc­
Connell finished fourth in the 
1650-yard freestyle with a “B” 
cut of 16:02.75. Sophomore An­
drew Seo and junior Brad Hen-
derson finished second and third, 
respectively, with “B” cut times. 
Huber and Hofler finished sixth 
and eighth in the event as well.
On the women’s side, Connell 
finished third in the 100-yard 
freestyle, earning All-UAA
marks and a season-best time of 
53.32. Kochalko had an impres­
sive 200-yard butterfly race, 
finishing second in 2:09.97 and 
getting a thii*d All-UAA mark in 
the meet. Junior Charlotte Jen­
nings placed fourth in diving 
and scored a national cut on the 
three-meter board.
Senior Margaret Hebner
had three career-best swims 
throughout the meet.
“I was very pleased with the 
performances of both teams,” 
she said. “The men especially 
showed amazing depth to move 
from third to second place. It was
• a great way to end my senior year 
and swimming career.”
This meet concluded the 
season for the majority of the 
swimmers and divers on the 
teams. Some will continue on 
to the NCAA championships in 
March, depending on where the 
qualifying times are set.

the Tartans struggled, finishing 
at 32.6 percent.
“The second half was a lot bet­
ter as we created more offense 
from our defense,” Roll said. 
“The second half of this game 
was quite different from the 
first half. They made nine three- 
pointers in the first half.... That 
was the difference in the first 
half right there.”
The Tartans got down early 
and trailed by 10 points for the 
majority of the game against 
Case Western on Sunday. Aleski 
scored a game-high 20 points 
and dished out four assists. The 
Tartans got within six points at 
the 13:39 mark of the second 
half, but Case responded to push 
its lead back into double-digits. 
Feola contributed 11 points and
11 rebounds and Roll pulled
down 10 rebounds in the loss.
“They’re a great three-point 
shooting team,” said Aleski. 
“Four of their girls are consis­
tent three-point shooters.... They 
were hitting their outside shots
— that killed us a few times. We 
weren’t getting our hands up in 
the first half.”
“Running our offense against 
Case was difficult because 
they’re constantly bumping you
— getting you out of your tim­
ing, rhythm,” Roll said. “The 
other thing they did really well 
today was after we scored a

championships.
Staloch and Chui earned wins 
at the top two singles positions, 
letting their opponents win just 
seven games combined against 
the two of them. Liebowitz and 
Herrick won two matches on the 
day too, holding off junior Natalie 
Larew and sophomore Eva Ceja 
at fourth and fifth singles, re­
spectively. Hart and fellow first- 
year Danielle Rosenfeld tried to 
shut out the opponents overall, 
but both women lost in three sets 
at their respective third and sixth 
singles positions.
“Our team did very well, and 
we dealt with the unusual pres­
sure of having rowdy fans in a 
good way,” Chui said. “I still feel
I need to work on some things 
for next time, though, especially 
getting a higher percentage of 
my first serves in.”
Tartan tennis will continue 
the season on March 1 at Oberlin 
College. Both teams will take on 
Case Western Reserve, and the 
women will plav Oberlin.
Professional hockey player and Pittsburgh native 
J.B. Bittner raises money for the Special Olympics

Many professional athletes 
have begun to use their fame and 
wealth to better the lives of oth­
ers. Steelers quarterback Charlie 
Batch spoke on campus about his 
Best of the Batch Foundation, 
and now J.B. Bittner, a Florida 
Everblades hockey player and an­
other Pittsburgh native, is giving 
back to the community as well.
The professional hockey player
decided to raise money for the 
Special Olympics after watching 
his 12-year-old cousin Patrick, 
born with Down Syndrome, par­
ticipate in the games.
The excitement of his cousin 
and that of the other athletes 
sparked a passion within Bittner. 
Since then, he has joined forces 
with Aspirations, a contempo­
rary golf apparel company, to 
create a new line. Ten percent of 
the proceeds from each sale go to 
the Special Olympics.
“I grew up in Pittsburgh and 
that’s the Special Olympics or­
ganization that my company will 
donate to first,” Bittner said. “My 
cousin participates in the Special 
Olympics of Allegheny County, 
and that’s why I wanted to pro­
mote in the Pittsburgh area.
“I chose golf shirts over hockey 
apparel because I felt that it was 
an easier market, plus there are 
a lot more people that play golf 
than hockey,” Bittner said. “I al­
ways wanted to give back to an
organization and now, since I’m 
starting this company, it gives 
me a chance tQ do that.”
Bittner Was inspired by the 
Special Olympians and now is 
using Aspirations as a way to in­
spire others to help, in addition 
to increasing awareness in the 
Pittsburgh area. He hopes that 
his contribution will provide the 
Special Olympics with the re­
sources to continue offering such 
an outstanding environment for 
people like Patrick.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and 
women’s tennis teams traveled to 
Gambier, Ohio last Saturday to 
face off against Kenyon College. 
The fifth-ranked women’s team 
won its fourth straight match of 
the spring, upending the previ­
ously undefeated Kenyon to im­
prove their overall record to 5-2 
in dual matches. However, the 
men’s team was unable to hold 
off Kenyon’s undefeated and vet­
eran squad as they lost 8-1, fall­
ing to 6-2 overall.
The men’s team played tough, 
sending four singles matches 
into the third set, and losing by 
just a combined three games in 
two of their doubles matches, but 
the players weren’t able to seal 
the deal Saturday. The normally 
strong doubles pair of sopho­
mores James Muliawan and 
Nikola Ljuboja, who had won five 
of their past six doubles matches,
lost to Kenyon at the at the first 
spot by a score of 8-2. First-year 
Bobby MacTaggart and sopho­
more Ravi Raghavan teamed 
A up as the number-two team and 
came within a game of victory, 
losing by a handful of points in 
a tiebreaker. Junior Yiran Liu 
and first-year Alex Nemerov also 
played their team close, but were 
beaten 8-6 in the end.
At the singles spots, senior An­
drew Clearfield, sophomore Jon 
Spero, and MacTaggart played 
some highly contested matches, 
each reaching the third set be­
fore losing to a Kenyon player. 
Nemerov was the lone Tartan to 
come away victorious, winning 
in his own three-set match 6-4, 
3-6, 6-2 at the second singles 
position.
Although he won, Nemerov 
found flaws in his own game 
and was disappointed about the 
events of the day.
“Personally, I feel I could have 
won in two sets if I just plaved
solid consistently,” he said. “As 
a team, we went in expecting to 
win, yet things obviously didn’t 
go our way. I feel we should have 
won the match despite the lop­
sided score.”
The women had a brighter 
finish this weekend, extending 
their own winning streak while 
ending another. In winning their 
fourth straight match of the 
spring, the Tartans defeated the 
previously unbeaten Kenyon Col­
lege women’s team 7-2.
The team swept the doubles 
spots in the process, with se­
nior Amy Staloch and first-year 
Jennifer Chui handily beating- 
their opponents at first doubles 
8-0. The first-year pairing of 
Kelly Hart and Ashley Herrick 
emerged as victors upon winning 
8-4 against two seasoned veter­
ans. Sophomore Alisa Liebowitz 
and first-year Brooke Loar were 
able to grind it out in their match, 
winning the final game for a 
score of 9-7.
J.B. Bittner teamed up with Aspirations, a clothing company, to raise money for the Special Olympics.

Men’s basketball defeats Emory Eagles 78-70, 
Case Western Reserve Spartans 70-66 at Skibo
PRTGW ARWMYI
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team hoped to 
preserve its NCAA tournament 
chances with two home victories 
over University Athletic Associa­
tion (UAA) opponents. The Tar­
tans polished off the Emory Uni­
versity Eagles Friday night and 
survived a late surge by the Case 
Western Reserve Spartans Sunday 
afternoon. The victories moved 
the team’s record to 16-8 overall 
with a 6-7 conference mark.
The story this weekend was 
super-senior forward Greg Gon­
zalez, who posted career num­
bers in both games to make his 
mark on the final UAA weekend 
in Skibo Gymnasium.
“We have Rochester next week­
end,” said Gonzalez, who had 21 
rebounds against Case, just two 
rebounds shy of the conference 
record. “But these are the last 
Friday and Sunday home games 
that Geoff and I are going to have 
here. It was real important to me 
to come out here and make them 
memorable. It was big to get these 
wins.”
Gonzalez performed well, get­
ting his third and fourth straight 
double-doubles this weekend. He 
put up 23 points and pulled down 
a then-career-high 14 rebounds 
Friday night before trumping him­
self Sunday with 12 points and 21 
rebounds. His 12 points Sunday 
included a clutch elbow jumper 
with just over a minute left to hold 
the surging Spartans off.
“I wasn’t even thinking,” said 
Gonzalez. “I just let it go. I had
the shot in front of me and I didn’t 
think about the score. I probably 
should’ve been, actually.”
The shot put a little more dis­
tance between the Tartans and 
Case Western, who hit a few late 
three-pointers to close the gap to 
three with two minutes remain­
ing.
“That would’ve looked pretty 
bad if we blew that one,” said ju­
nior guard Corey O’Rourke, who 
had his own eight-point surge in 
the first two minutes of the sec­
ond half. “That’s just an example 
of why we need to stay focused 
for 40 minutes. We dominated 
that game, and we almost lost it 
because we figured we had it in 
the bag.”
Carnegie Mellon also got a solid 
weekend out of leading scorer 
Ryan Einwag, who had 17 points 
Friday and 16 Sunday. Geoff Ko­
zak hit a clutch three late in the 
game against Case Western to 
curb the Spartans’ final run. Ko­
zak had nine points Friday and 
eight Sunday, but he and Gonza­
lez often make contributions that 
don’t end up on the stat sheet.
“It was a good final UAA week­
end,” Kozak said. “Greg and I like 
to think we’ve been leading this 
team all season, and this has been 
pretty memorable. It was good 
to wrap our Friday and Sunday 
games with victories. Now, we 
just have to focus on closing out 
strong against Rochester next 
Saturday.”
The Tartans finish their season 
against the 14th-ranked Yellow 
Jackets of Rochester Saturday at 
Skibo Gym. A victory will help to 
determine their postseason fate.Jon Wolleben (#24) jumps for a shot in the game against Case Western.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
basketball team suffered a pair of 
setbacks this past weekend in the 
friendly confines of Skibo Gym. 
The Tartans lost 69-46 to the 
visiting Emory Eagles Friday and 
then dropped a 63-49 decision 
to Case Western Reserve Sunday 
in University Athletic Association 
(UAA) action. The team is now 
7-17 overall, 0-13 in the UAA.
Against Emory Friday night, 
Carnegie Mellon was the victim of 
a three-point shooting barrage by 
the Eagles. Emory went 9-12 from 
beyond the arc in the first half and 
jumped out to a 46-23 halftime 
lead. Senior forward Leah Feola’s
10 first-half points led the way for 
the Tartans. The Eagles cooled off
in the second half, and when they 
increased their lead to 31 points, 
Carnegie Mellon responded by 
hitting a few baskets and con­
necting on some free throws. The 
second half of play ended in the 
Eagles’ favor as they won by 23 
points.
“The first half was a struggle es­
pecially because they were scoring 
a lot,” said junior forward Rachelle 
Roll. “Even though we might have 
been scoring, it [doesn’t] feel like 
it when the other team is scoring 
twice as much as you are.”
Feola finished with a season- 
high 19 points, junior point guard 
Stacie Aleski added 10, and Roll 
pulled down a game-high 11 re­
bounds. Emory shot 47.3 percent 
from the floor for the game while

This past weekend, the Tar­
tan men’s and women’s swim­
ming and diving teams traveled 
to Rochester, N.Y. for this year’s 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) championship meet. The 
three-day meet ended with the 
Carnegie Mellon men in second 
place following Emory University.
The women finished in fourth 
place behind Emory University, 
Washington University in St. 
Louis, and New York University.
Following Thursday’s finals 
round, defending UAA diving 
champion sophomore Matt Kuhn 
was in second place with 430.90 
points on the three-meter spring­
board. His teammate, sophomore 
Joe Kopko, placed fourth. Coming 
in third in the 50-yard freestyle,
senior Patrick Snyder finished in
21.31. More impressive was his 
preliminary finish in an NCAA 
provisional mark of 21.12, his 
career best, that morning. The 
other great individual swim for 
the men came from junior Tom 
McConnell in the 500-yard free­
style with a career-best time and 
fifth-place finish of 4:39.00 in the 
finals.
The men’s 200-yard freestyle
relay team clocked its top time 
of the season, finishing in fourth, 
with a time of 1:25.21. The 
400-yard relay team finished in 
sixth place in a time of 3:30.09.

With just one regular-season 
game left, graduate student 
Greg Gonzalez has seen a lot 
of action during his time in 
Skibo Gymnasium. After red- 
shirting due to an injury last 
season, Gonzalez has returned 
to the court, acquiring UAA 
honors and double-double sta­
tistics in rebounding and scor­
ing. As co-captain, Gonzalez 
reflected on life at Carnegie 
Mellon both on and off the 
hardwood.
The Tartan: As your final 
basketball season winds down, 
what are you going to miss the 
most about being a part of the 
team?
Gonzalez: The game has 
been good to me and I’ve loved 
playing basketball, but the 
guys I have played with while 
I am here are going to be my 
best and closest friends for the 
rest of my life.
T: What are you interested 
in pursuing after the school 
year ends?
G: I’ve got my whole life 
to work, so I am in no rush 
to start throwing money into 
a 401 (k). I am going to try 
and keep playing basketball in 
Europe. Since basketball spans 
both semesters, I never got to 
take a semester abroad, and I 
always thought that would be 
pretty cool. Plus, I would get to 
play basketball and get money, 
even if it’s not much. I would 
be getting paid to play a game
— not a bad gig.
T: Do you have a favorite 
event that happens at Carnegie 
Mellon?
G: No questions asked, 
Carnival. The school is a com­
pletely different place and 
looks and feels like the bro­
chures that get sent home. 
There’s no work, the sun is 
always out, people are out 
playing bocci or throwing the 
football. It’s a great time to 
just hang out and relax before 
finals.
T: How will basketball be a 
part of your life in the future?
G: Basketball can teach you 
so much about people and 
about yourself. Eventually, I 
will get a real-person job and 
have to grow up, but as soon 
as I put away enough money, 
I would love to coach middle 
school basketball and teach 
math.
Kids, when they are that 
young, are so impressionable, 
and a good coach’s advice can 
stay with them through their 
whole life. I’m not a crazy Xs 
and Os guy... I enjoy coaching 
the basics. The smile on a kid 
who finally hits a jump shot 
with the right form or a layup 
jumping off the correct foot is 
an awesome thing to watch.
T: Did observing the team 
last year give you any new 
perspectives on playing this 
season?
G: Absolutely! Watching 
last season was tough and 
made me feel so useless, but 
I learned patience and self- 
confidence to add to my game. 
I also think I gained a lot of 
the players’ respect by being a 
medium between the players 
and the coaches.
Since I couldn’t go out there 
and put the ball in the hoop, 
I tried to help as much dur­
ing practice through playing, 
and as much during the games 
through advice.
T: What advice would you 
leave with the team for sea­
sons to come?
G: Enjoy every moment, 
of it. It goes by quickly and 
don’t ever take it for granted. 
When it’s all over, we won’t re­
member who scored the most 
points this game....
But you’ll remember Wing 
Night, betting on bags com­
ing off the carousel, water 
boxes, hilarious rounds of golf 
at Schenley, Guitar Hero tour­
naments, Warcraft battles.... 
Each guy on the team is worth 
way more than his stats show.
T: Do you have a memora­
ble experience involving bas­
ketball from when you were 
growing up?
G: My senior year of high 
school we played the number- 
two team in the state, at their 
place, and got rocked.... We 
got an opportunity to play 
them again at our place for the 
last game....
We met up on my senior 
night to play for the district 
championship. We went to 
overtime and they missed a 
three-pointer to win it. When 
the buzzer sounded, the 
packed student section rushed 
the court and hoisted up some 
of the players. It was probably 
my best basketball memory 
before I came to college.
T: Do you feel that you have 
had special opportunities 
throughout your college career 
by being a student athlete?
G: The UAA is so great in 
that we travel first class. We 
stay in nice hotels, fly to con­
ference games, and get to eat 
well. I had traveled to most 
of the cities before I came to 
college, but the trips we have 
had around each UAA city has 
been a great advantage to be­
ing a student athlete. Also, I 
met a lot of people through 
athletics.
T: Has playing basketball in 
college changed the way you 
view the game?
G: Not really.... The best part 
about Division III athletes is 
the love of the game. None of 
us are here on athletic schol­
arships, none of us sign auto­
graphs for fans after game?, 
you can’t buy our jerseys in the 
bookstore — but we still play.
We still show up for 7 a.m. 
practices, we still show up to 
lift when other kids are out 
goofing around. When people 
are putting off writing a pa­
per, we’re getting up a few 
extra shots, and when every­
one goes home for a month 
Christmas break, we take off 
for seven days and come back 
to two-a-days and games in an 
empty gym.
There are kids here who 
have the best work ethics I’ve 
ever seen and don’t get a dime 
for it or even the respect that 
they deserve for working so 
hard. That’s the most impres­
sive thing about Division III 
athletes.
T: What are your thoughts 
about your last home game?
G: The kids who have no 
ties to the team except that 
they are Carnegie Mellon stu­
dents — those are my favorite 
fans. We have an opportunity 
to make postseason play so 
there is no telling when our last 
home game will be, but there’s 
a chance that Saturday against 
Rochester might be the last 
time Geoff and I play in Skibo 
for real. It would be great if we 
could pack the house.

Do it yourself
Make your own books
Ever wanted to make a small children's book for 
friends or family, but didn't have any idea how?
Sure, you can take the book-binding class offered at 
Carnegie Mellon, but for those who are looking for 
something a little less official, here’s how you can . 
make your own children's books.
Select the desired page size of the book. Then, get 
sheets of paper that have a width that is twice the 
size of the desired page width: For example, for a 
book in which-each page is six inches wide and nine 
inches tall, the paper chosen would need to be 12 
inches wide by nine inches tall. Print the content on 
each side of each sheet of paper. If the paper is held 
in a landscape fashion, there should be text/pictures 
on the left side of a sheet and then different text/ 
pictures on the right side of the sheet. The same 
configuration should be on the back side of the sheet. 
Remember to be careful of the page, order.
The easiest way to print the text/pictures would be 
to first figure out how many pages there are going 
to be. Then, if using Microsoft Word, set the page to 
Landscape, and then in the Format menu, choose 
Columns, and select Two. If page one is going to be 
on the left side when the book is opened, then on 
your first page, the left column should be your page 
one, while the right column should be the last page.
On the second page, the left column should be page 
two and the right column should be the second to 
last page. However, if page one is going to be on the 
right side when the book is opened, then on your first 
page, the right side of the page should be your page 
one, while the left side is the last page of the book. 
Continue this pattern until the center two pages 
meet.
Next, fold all the pages in half so that the left and 
right sides meet. Place each sandwiched sheet into 
the one before it so that all the pages together form a 
little booklet. Using embroidery thread and a heavy 
needle, carefully stitch down the center crease of the 
booklet, knotting the book on the outside face of the 
seam.
To make the cover, you need three pieces of 
cardboard. The cardboard can be cut from recycled 
boxes or bought new. Two pieces should be slightly 
larger in height and width than the pages of the 
book itself. The last piece should be the same 
height as the other two pieces of cardboard, but • 
should be about a quarter of an inch wide. Then 
take a sheet of paper the same size as the paper 
you used for your book pages and place the center 
of it over the thin strip of cardboard. Next, carefully 
stitch the booklet’s center seam to the thin strip of 
cardboard, right through the paper placed over the 
strip.
Print the cover design for the book onto a large 
sheet of paper in the same fashion as the booklet 
pages; if you place the cover sheet onto a table, 
with the design side down on the surface, the front 
cover design should be on your left and the back 
cover design should be on your right. Lay the two 
large pieces of cardboard centered on the blank, 
face-up portion of the cover sheet. Put the thin strip 
of cardboard in between the two larger pieces, and 
place all pieces flush together. The cover sheet 
should have about one inch of excess all around 
the centered cardboard configuration. Fold the 
one-inch excess of the cover sheet over and around 
the edges of the cardboard, taking care to properly 
fold the corners. Lastly, glue the edges of the sheet 
sewn between the thin strip of cardboard and the 
book pages down on top. of the folded-over cover 
sheet. Wipe off any excess glue, and clamp the 
book for about an hour. To clamp the book, you can 
do something as simple as laying it on a flat surface 
and putting a physics textbook on top of it.
The next time you need to give your niece, baby 
brother, or even best friend a present, give the 
gift of a homemade book. It’s a great way to 
make something fun, original, and creative. And 
remember, gifts are always a little more special 
when they're homemade.

Everything you need to know
About passivity and freaking out
Dear Rachael,
%
When I start dating someone, I 
freak out. I wonder, Do I still like 
them? Do they still like me? And 
don’t even get me started on 
business beneath the sheets — 
let’s just say I’m a little insecure 
about my... abilities.
Why is the courting, do-you- 
like-me-circle-yes-or-no phase 
always so much more exciting 
than the actual relationship? Am 
I doing something wrong?
—Confused girlfriend
Oh, girl,
It sounds like you need some 
pure, unadulterated, burning love. 
But not the STD kind. The chase 
is, admittedly, the best part of 
modern-day courtship. After that, 
all hints of romance go out of the 
window. Am I right or am I right? 
You're not doing anything wrong; 
that’s just the natural order of 
things.
I’d say don’t think so much. The 
mind can be a terrible thing when it 
overthinks. Analyzing a situation to 
death isn’t going to help you. I’d say 
follow your heart, but that’s terribly 
tacky. Instead, I’ll say just follow 
your gut (a much less romantic part 
of the body, don’t you think?) What’s 
your first instinct? Follow it. And 
tackle your insecurity by promoting 
honesty in your relationships — ask 
him if your latest... techniques, for 
lack of a better word, were satisfying 
or could stand for improvement. Do 
new things to make you and your 
boo feel like you just met.
Get on to lovin’!
—Rachael
Dear Rachael,
I’ve never been the person who 
approaches a girl to ask her out. 
In fact, I’ve only done it once 
and only after some serious 
seesawing with myself (that girl 
is now one of my best friends). 
However, I have found myself 
in a position where I really like 
someone. Only hang up is that 
she’s a junior and myself a lowly 
freshman. How can I get past 
that sinking feeling of inferiority 
and at the same time confront 
my fear of actually trying to ask 
a girl out? ,
—Pretty Passive Person
P to the 3rd power,
My most sincere advice would be 
to invest in a nice and durable set 
of cojones. Seriously! How can 
you expect to get what you want if 
you don’t go for it? Think of it like 
this: Things could always go really 
wrong. But you’ll never know how 
horrible everything will go until you 
dip that toe into the pool of love! Or 
lust, like, whatever.
As for the older woman, who knows 
if your lady friend (you're at least 
friends, right?) isn’t the cougar 
type? She could like a younger 
man, assuming you've completed 
puberty. More importantly, though, 
two years may seem like a lot now, 
but it's not much at all. I can think 
of plenty of couples, albeit mostly of 
the celebrity persuasion, that have 
up to 15-year gaps in age.
Tap that!
—Rachael

Bollywood comes to Carnegie Mellon
Mellon Masala brings South Asia to Pittsburgh
Bright lights, great music, energetic dancers, and an 
entertaining cast of actors lit up the Wiegand Gym on Feb.
23 with a Mellon Masala, a fun and diverse performance in 
the style of a Bollywood film. Produced by Mayur South Asian 
Student Alliance (Mayur-SASA), the show drew together all 
the elements of a typical Bollywood movie — song, dance, 
romance, and melodrama — and wove them together to 
create a great production. Bollywood is the Indian version of 
Hollywood, centered at Mumbai, the hub of entertainment in 
India which churns out more than 1000 movies a year.
“The whole aim of the show is to depict Bollywood," said 
junior biomedical and chemical engineering major Kamya 
Somasundaram, co-producer of Mellon Masala. “The reason 
for us doing this is because we feel [that] Bollywood is a big 
symbol of South Asian culture. One of the things we're trying 
to emphasize is the true South Asian identity itself."
The main aim of the show is to reach out to people who do not 
know about South Asian culture and give them a chance toi 
experience it in full color and flavor.
"We're aiming for a cultural experience," Somasundaram said. 
“[We want] to promote Bollywood and everything that relates 
to it.”
Co-producer and junior business administration major Sanya 
Gurnani agreed. "People should walk out knowing more about 
South Asian culture," she said.
While reaching out to a diverse audience, the show’s cast is 
also diverse, consisting of many graduate and undergraduate 
students whose backgrounds do not include South Asia.
The plot centered on an Indian boy (Raj Kumar, played 
•by sophomore business administration major Arpon Ray)
and a Pakistani girl (Samiah Khan, played by business 
administration sophomore Sarah Sheikh) and their struggle 
to overcome all the obstacles that prevent them from uniting 
in love. The play was peppered with one-liners and hilarious 
performances by the lovers’ parents (played by Dhruv Mathur, 
a junior in information systems, and Nirvi Maru, a senior ¦ 
in social and decision sciences), but what really spiced up 
the show were the great dance performances intertwined 
between scenes.
The show opened with traditional Indian performances 
of dance and music: a jugalbandhi, which is a fusion of 
instrumental music played on different instuments (in 
this case, the miidangam, the tabla and the dhol), and a 
Bharatanatyam recital, a traditional, South-Indian dance.
The play began wjth Raj and Samiah both leaving for college, 
respectively, from Kolkata, India and New Jersey. Raj is 
excited about meeting hot girls, while Samiah is waiting to 
be reunited with her boyfriend Chandrashekar (played by 
Prashanth Swamy, a sophomore in biological sciences). But 
as the plot unfolds, a chance meeting in a computer cluster 
makes Raj fall madly in love with Samiah. Then Samiah 
discovers that her boyfriend is cheating on her and turns to 
Raj.
The show then took a sudden twist as the lovers' parents 
arrive at college for.family weekend and Samiah’s father 
announces that he has found her a fiance (played by CIT . 
first-year Gary Verma). After much sorrow, Raj finally pulls it 
together and, accompanied by his mother and friends, sets 
out to win back Samiah. When they find her, it turns out that 
Raj’s mother and Samiah's father were lovers in their youth. 
Reminded of their own unfinished love story, the parents 
concede, and the couple is finally reunited to live happily ever 
after.
The first half of the show features many dances but the one 
that stood out the most was the “Item Number” performed 
by sophomore public policy and management major Kamaria 
Hayden. The play also used projected videos of Samiah and 
Raj to flesh out the plot.
The show also featured a great vocal performance by an 
all-male a cappella group Deewane, which provided a 
soundtrack for Raj and Samiah’s first date at Lulu's, shown 
in one of the projected videos. A break dance performance 
by student group broKen Glass was equally entertaining to 
watch.
Additional dance performances by South Asian dance troupe 
Tanah, Bhangra troupe Chak De, and the South Asian Seniors 
were well received along-with solo music performances 
by computer science senior Kwasi Mensah and software 
engineering graduate student Sai Shankar. Apart from group 
song and dance, Mellon Masala had a fashion shovy with 
clothes designed by H&SS first-year Sonam Rajpal.
As a whole, the entire show was immensely entertaining, 
providing a window into the South Asian world. It was unique 
in the way it linked all of the different acts together to create 
a continuous performance. With bursts of color, music, and 
dance moves, Mayur-SASA provided the audience with a fun 
way to enjoy the different aspects of South Asian culture.

The Vagina Monologues
Serious talk with no beating around the busha radio stationOn unique vocals
Last week, an ensemble cast and crew made up of 
Carnegie Mellon students and faculty put on The Vagina 
Monologues, an award-winning play that showcases 
the vagina — and all the pleasure and pain that come 
with having one — through a series of short dialogues. 
Each of the 16 monologues was performed by either 
the ensemble cast or a single actor, usually seated in 
a couch or chair. A total of 18 Carnegie Mellon women 
were involved with the production of the show, ranging 
from first-years all the way to the associate dean at the 
Heinz School of Public Policy and Management.
The Vagina Monologues was first written by Eve 
Ensler and performed in 1996 as a solo act. It has since 
evolved into a worldwide stage show often performed 
by celebrities. The play has beerj performed annually at 
Carnegie Mellon since 2003 and was also performed on 
Valentine's Day at the University of Pittsburgh.
As expected, the play showed no beating around^the 
bush in presenting its message from the start. The 
show began with a short introduction, during which 
the actors told several euphemisms for the vagina, to 
an audience that was surprisingly evenly split among 
males and females. Basically, if you’ve ever referred to 
your vagina, or someone else’s vagina, as anything other 
than “vagina,” then there's about a 99.9 percent chance 
it was uttered during this monologue.
Following the introduction, a deeply moving monologue 
entitled "Hair" was performed, detailing a woman’s 
struggle to cope with her husband’s desire to shave 
her vagina, even though it causes her great pain and 
discomfort. The audience is able to truly connect with 
and feel sorry for the woman, despite the fact that this 
is a subject usually kept within private conversations. 
Opening with this particular monologue definitely set 
the tone that the play was not just a happy-go-lucky 
gigglefest about vaginas. The Vagina Monologues was 
designed to help women feel a greater sense of pride 
in themselves and their bodies, while educating both 
sexes about the vagina and what it means to have one.
The next skit featured an ensemble of women sitting 
across from each other in a semicircle,' each giving 
answers to two questions that Ensler asked in 
interviews with actual women, which she used to gain 
material for the monologues. The questions in this 
particular monologue were, “If your vagina could speak, 
what would it say?” and “What would it wear?” Various 
answers gained some laughs from the audiences, 
including that a vagina would say “slow down” and 
would wear sequins.
For the most part, the play alternated loose, comical 
monologues with the more serious and dramatic ones, 
including a heartbreaking dialogue about vaginal 
mutilation (“My Vagina was my Village") and general 
violence toward women (“A Memory of Her Face"), both 
key themes of the V-Day movement.
The Vagina Monologues is the cornerstone of the V-Day 
movement, which has taken place around Valentine’s 
Day every year since 1998. Founded by Eve Ensler,
V-Day itself is a non-profit charity that has raised over
$50 million to help end violence against women. It raises 
awareness and money through benefit productions such 
as The Vagina Monologues.
H&SS first-year Aliesha Jones; who performed during 
"A Memory of Her Face,” had not heard much about 
V-Day before The Vagina Monologues.
“I became very interested in the cause after a friend 
sent me an e-mail about it,” said Jones. “I had not 
participated in any other V-Day events, but anything 
that comes up in the future will definitely be of interest 
to me.”
The second to last monologue left a lasting impression 
on the audience. The organizer of V-Day, Sarah P. 
Amador, performed "The Woman Who Loved to 
Make Vaginas Happy,” in which a lesbian dominatrix 
discusses her career and her love of giving women 
pleasure. Near the end of her monologue, the entire 
cast entered the stage and gave vocal demonstrations 
of a wide variety of the moans the dominatrix has heard 
during her illustrious career, including fan favorites 
the “Black moan” and the "Jewish moan,” with the 
monologue literally climaxing in a "triple orgasm” moan.
The Vagina Monologues was 
designed to help women feel 
a greater sense of pride In 
themselves and their bodies, 
while educating both sexes 
about the vagina and what it 
means to have one.
Amador commented on thè importance of showing The 
Vagina Monologues at Carnegie Mellon. "Well, I think 
it raises awareness to a variety of issues that affect 
women, and therefore I think it’s a show all women 
should see.”
Fellow performer and Heinz School first-year graduate 
student in arts management Jennifer Clarke agreed.
“When I first saw the show, it really made me feel 
empowered and enlightened and I wanted to be ' 
a part of that,” she said. “There was a real sense 
of camaraderie and purpose, especially given the 
charitable nature of V-Day. Doing the show as so much 
fun, we had a great cast.”

global movement to stop violence against women and 
girls of all ages and races.
One of the things that has always fascinated me about music is 
examining the properties-that endear an artist to a specific listener. I 
know I prefer bands that put emphasis on drums and bass, while a 
friend of mine has distilled her “perfect formula" for listening down to 
something like: syncopated beat, handclaps, British male singing.
No area of music is more difficult for people to understand their 
preferences in than vocals. Much has been written about Bob Dylan’s 
love-it-or-hate-it voice, but that's just the beginning. A different friend 
of mine and I have had a long-standing debate on the subject.
It started with an artist named Max Tundra, who asked his vocally 
untrained sister to sing on a few tracks of his album Mastered by a 
Guy at the Exchange. Her voice is technically terrible, I’m sure, but I 
really enjoy it, while some of my friends can’t stand listening to it, calling 
it "breathy and grating." Then there was Joy Division, the vocalist for 
which I find forced and straining, but some of my friends find natural 
and powerful.
The confusion about vocals doesn’t start and end with my friends, 
though. Witness critically acclaimed but technically horrendous Slint 
and Sonic Youth. Or, one person might love old Kate Bush records, 
the next despises them. More recently there are bands like Battles 
(who “sound like robots”), Joanna Newsom (who alternately receives 
glowing praise and comments that she “sounds like a frog” from 
reviewers), or the Knife (heavily acqented and indescribable). The list 
goes on, full of conflict with little explanation but personal preference.
Then there are artists who do non-traditional things with vocals. 
Bogdan Raczynski pitches his voice way, way up and sounds sort of 
like a children’s special gone wrong. Experimental German group Can’s 
Damo Suzuki blabbers about nothing, repeats words incessantly, and 
even just burbles vague sounds — yet fits the music surrounding 
him perfectly. Halfway through Naked City’s “Leng Tch’e” the guitars 
drop out and an utterly bloodcurdling scream comes in, lasting for 15 
minutes. I was actually frightened when I heard it the first time. Would 
it have been possible to get this effect with words or singing? Would it 
have been possible with instruments only?
We have a large vocabulary of terms that we use to describe 
instrumental parts, yet I’m not aware of any technical terminology 
like this for .vocal parts. Is there any? Or are we just doomed to the 
cliché observation that in popular music, listeners prefer vocalists of 
the gender they want to sleep with? This correlation is borne out when 
I think back over discussions I’ve had in the past, but I have to believe 
there’s more to it than that.

The Clock strikes 25
Pitt performs Arthur Miller’s play about the Great Depression
In its biggest show of the 2007-2008 season, the Pittsburgh 
Repertory Theatre is performing Arthur Miller’s The American 
Clock, a vaudeville-style play set during the Great Depression. 
The show opened last Thursday and runs through March
2, and is also a celebration of the the company’s 25th 
anniversary.
Miller is best known for his works Death of a Salesman and 
The Crucible, both of which closely follow a small group of 
people. The American Clock is a departure from this style that 
Miller tackled late in his career. The play features glimpses 
into the lives of many characters while combining elements of 
song and dance into the performance. This style is especially 
appropriate for The American Clock, in part because of the 
play’s setting, the Great Depression, which was an era when 
vaudeville was popular. Additionally, the play was based on 
Studs Terkel’s Hard Times, an oral history which lends itself to 
a style that encompasses large numbers of characters.
Although The American Clock portrays a broad array of 
characters, the story is ostensibly centered around the Baum 
family, an upper-class New York family that loses almost 
everything in the Dépression. Miller uses the Baums to show 
a variety of poignant moments. One example is an exchange 
between the father Moe (professor Doug Mertz) and his son 
Lee (student Björn Ahlstedt), when the former can barely look 
his son in the eye as he asks to borrow a quarter to take the 
subway to work. Another memorable moment is when Rose 
(professor Elena Alexandratos), Moe’s wife, refuses to leave 
her piano bench even after the debt collectors come to take 
her piano away; as the instrument is rolled off of the stage, 
Rose is left sitting awkwardly on the bench, mourning the loss 
of her last prized possession.
The smaller characters' vignettes were less impressive.
For one thing, the text of the play seemed at times stuck
in its original form as an oral history — characters ranted 
about poverty, hope, and belief in a style that didn't seem 
appropriate outside of a Terkel anthology. Also, the music was 
for the most part tiresome and poorly executed. It seemed 
that every good actor couldn't sing (and vice versa), and the 
1920s-style tunes (sparse piano, lazy vocals) oversaturated 
the stage with historical context — imagine Hair with more 
tie-dye or Grease with extra poodle skirts.
Still, the essence of The American Clock should be accessible 
for most audience members, particularly college students. 
Written shortly after the Vietnam War, the play covers some 
familiar themes, including,discontent with the government 
and economic distress. The scenes with Lee, who attends and 
graduates college during the play, were especially relatable; 
we see Lee and his friends reluctant to accept their diplomas, 
unhappy to enter a world where it will be difficult to find a job 
or afford a place to live.
"I’ve liked the play for quite a long time, but it was chosen 
now specifically because ... the crutch of the script is dealing 
with people’s loss in belief in their country," said director 
Robert C.T. Steele, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh.
"There a're a lot of moments, lines, and images in the show 
that people seem to connect with," he said. “It may not be 
Arthur Miller’s best play, but I think it can still be evocative, 
especially to a college audience.”
In producing the play Pitt Rep made several changes to the 
script, including truncating the ending and customizing 
the-music. The play’s actual ending includes a montage 
of scenes relating to Vietnam and other issues from the 
time when Miller was writing it. In removing this section, 
Steele succeeded in keeping the play focused on the Great 
Depression.
“In reading reviews of past productions, all of them talked 
about the ending as either confusing or too little, too late,” 
Steele said.
Pitt Rep also changed some of the play's music, for better 
or worse. According to Steele, the script often called for 
a song with the option of substituting one like it, offering 
some flexibility. Though the effect of the added music was 
not without its flaws, The American Clock is only one of the 
plays that Pitt had added music to this season, including last 
fall’s The Recruiting Officer and the upcoming Cymbeline, by 
Shakespeare.
“I don’t know that it would be a trend,” Steele said, “but it’s . 
very exciting to really custom fit music [for a play].”
One interesting aspect of Pitt Rep plays is many involve 
both students and professors, technically known as teaching 
artists. Though this may seem unusual at many university 
programs, it's the norm at Pitt, where many believe the 
interaction between’students and professionals helps the 
former improve.
“It’s specifically how the program at the University of 
Pittsburgh is," Steele said. "I think people rise up to a higher 
level naturally by being in that sort of situation.”

Top 10 Oscar snubs
From Psycho to Sixteen Candles
Each year, Oscar nominations and awards are a controversial 
topic among actors, directors, and readers of celebrity 
magazines alike. There are many leading actors and actresses 
that are overlooked by the academy in its decision of whom 
to award the golden Oscar statuettes: the following men and 
women were somehow among the overlooked.
10. Amy Adams in Enchanted (2007)
Amy Adams made this real-life rendition of a Disney film in 
New York City a success. Her voice, smile, and royal manner 
made it possible for her to sing and talk to birds and squirrels 
without seeming like a crazy person, but like just another 
Disney princess, outside of her typical cartoon world.
9. Molly Ringwald in Sixteen Candles (1984)
Ringwald portrays the plight of a forgotten 16-year-old on her 
birthday with amazing ease as she is felt up by her grandma, 
has her underwear put on display, and is the host to a foreign 
exchange student named Long Duck Dong.
8. Rachel McAdams in Mean Girls (2004)
There has been no better mean girl represented on the silver 
screen than McAdams’ character Regina George in Tina Fey’s 
masterpiece film. George’s bright mini-skirts, facetious and 
witty insults, all-carbohydrate diet, and ridiculous confidence 
level make her character a true original that cannot be missed.
7. Ryan Gosling in The Notebook (2004)
Teenage girls were not the only people in love with The
Notebook and, specifically, with Ryan Gosling. Gosling’s 
sweet, innocent face and undying devotion to his sweetheart 
(played by Rachel McAdams) was enough to make any 
woman swoon, and they made him a model for the storybook 
man every woman can only hope for.
6. Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse 
of the Black Pearl (2003)
There is perhaps no better pirate than Captain Jack Sparrow 
with his jet-black hair and eyeliner, enchanting smile, and 
impressive cockney accent. It is a wonder that the academy 
has not yet joined Sparrow’s crew.
5. Jack Nicholson in The Shining (1980)
Nicholson has instilled fear with a mere facial expression: The 
way in which Nicholson bends his head and stares into the 
camera is enough to make any horror movie fan shiver.
4. Anthony Perkins in Psycho (1960)
The Psycho shower scene is one of the most classic honor 
scenes in existence. The privilege of an Oscar is definitely due 
to the man who has perfected the “psycho stare” and elicited 
from Janet Leigh one of the shrillest screams from behind the 
shower curtain that the silver screen has ever known.
3. Gene Kelly in Singin’ in the Rain (1952)
With an umbrella and dancing shoes in tow, Kelly brightened 
up the pouring rain with his light-hearted acting and dancing 
routines. Kelly’s performance has caused others to imitate
him while walking in the rain in flip-flops, Ugg boots, and rain 
boots alike.
2. Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady (1964)
Playing the role of Eliza Dolittle, Hepburn makes the switch 
from a cockney London flower girl to a proper English 
aristocrat. She learns to speak eloquently, wears feathered 
hats and large-bowed dresses as if she were born to, and 
informs the world that "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the 
plain.”
1. Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz (1939)
Seventeen-year-old Garland more than stood her ground in 
her red sequined shoes, working alongside the older and 
more experienced actors who played the Tin Man, Scarecrow, 
and Cowardly Lion. Her rendition of “Somewhere Over the 
Rainbow” has become an anthem for little girls with their hair 
in braids and ribbons, in addition to adults worldwide.

lifestyle and plunged Into the harsh 
Alaskan wilderness with little food or 
equipment. Emile Hlrsch (also set to 
star in the movie Speed Racer for all 
you anime fans) shines in his portrayal 
of a man who abandons all fear in 
order to find some meaning in life. 
While many criticize McCandless’ lack 
of preparedness — he died mainly 
because he brought no maps of the 
area with him — many others are 
sympathetic to his fate. Into the Wild is 
a touching and inspiring adventure film 
that may make you re-evaluate some 
of life’s priorities and see the world in a 
brand new light.

Loosely based on the epic poem of the 
same name, this movie uses a motion 
capturing technique in order to animate 
an actor’s movements, and offers a 
different explanation for the events 
that unfold than the original story. On 
the one hand, the deviations from the 
original serve to help tie the events 
together better and also make for some 
dramatic moments. However, one of 
the more telling departures from the 
original poem is the inclusion of Angelina 
Jolie as the human form of Grendel’s 
mother. Upon researching the matter, it 
was discovered that the oldest surviving 
piece of literature in the English language 
makes no mention of a beast with two 
large, luscious lips.
Black Sheep

A1996 comedy starring David Spade and 
Chris Farley... Wait, there’s another Black 
Sheep'? It’s about what!? All right! It’s the 
“Violence of the Lambs” in this 2006 New 
Zealand horror/comedy — which is the 
best kind of comedy, by the way. Black 
Sheep chronicles just what happens when 
genetic experiments go horribly, and 
hilariously, awry. Despite some flaws, this 
film is perfect for those of you who loved 
Peter Jackson’s early work (ever heard 
of Dead Alive!) and horror that doesn’t 
hesitate to not take Itself seriously. With 
the tagline, “There are 40 million sheep in 
New Zealand... and they’re pissed off,” 
how can you not give up a dollar to see 
this movie?

Confrontation through art
CFA art professor Lowry Burgess displays artwork at the Carnegie Museum
F by Matthew E. Campbell j Copy Staff j
It’s been 40 years since 1968, the year in American history 
that saw the Tet Offensive, the turning point in the 
Vietnam War that blew apart the Johnson administration’s 
assertions that the United States was winning the war. It 
was also the year that saw the assassinations of Martin 
Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy and the election of 
Richard Nixon, which lead to decades of conservatism.
Lowry Burgess, then a 28-year-old protester and now a 
67-year-old professor in the Carnegie Mellon University 
School of Art who has installed artworks all over the world, 
has spent a lifetime trying to heal — Vietnam is "still 
an open wound,” he says — or to explain, to justify, or, 
perhaps, to ignore and forget the conflict.
A few weeks ago at the Carnegie Museum of Art, when 
Burgess read poems from his book, Quiet Axis, that were 
related to Vietnam, his gray-bearded face turned red and 
he nearly broke up as he spoke.
“I didn’t think I’d fall apart reading a text that's so old," he 
said the next day. "All of this is still so alive.”
While an art student at the University of Pennsylvania in 
the early '60s, Burgess fell in love with Southeast Asian 
culture and studied 4000 years of failure to conquer 
Vietnam. He recalled one pivotal night in 1968 when a 
particularly bloody newscast made him realize that all of 
his protest efforts had been virtually ineffective. Burgess 
said protest was like "throwing marshmallows at tanks,” 
that American politicians were equally as implacable as 
the Soviet tanks that were rampaging through Prague at 
the time.
Burgess had also lived under the shadow of the draft for 
five years. “The draft made a lot of people very sweaty and 
aware,” he said. Initially, college students were exempt,
but by the time the government began drafting college 
students, Burgess had married. Then, by the time the 
government started drafting married people, Burgess had 
had a child.
From 1966 to 1970, Burgess turned away from protest 
and to his art, another means of protest. He created four 
paintings, “The Lotus,” “The Rose,” “The White Lily,” and 
“The Crocus.” The four paintings, oil on canvas, are each 
approximately 12 feet by 16 feet. Only inches separate the 
paintings from the monotonous slate-grey floor tiles and the 
light-grey ceiling in the Forum 61 gallery at the Carnegie 
Museum of Art, where the paintings are on display through 
March 23.
In 1968, Burgess had the first of many visions that 
would guide his work. The first vision was of a floating 
pond of water angled toward the sun in Afghanistan, a 
vision Burgess would actually create using holograms in 
Afghanistan in 1974.
Burgess believes that art has the power to fundamentally 
change society. Still, at age 67 and weakened by post-polio 
syndrome, Burgess believes that the country may have 
squandered a golden opportunity to break out of the cycle 
of history in 1968.
“For me, art is another form of direct confrontation,”
Burgess said. “It is often more fundamentally important
— aiming at a totally different layer of consciousness that 
ultimately changes the basis of the social conversation and 
fundamental change. I have done it and so have others — 
but you need to be within a whole field of actions along the 
same vector which are historically rare.”
Burgess rues the missed chances of the 1960s, the example 
he gives as the “whole field of actions," a time when college
students and youth around the world rose up and the 
movement challenged the establishment. “[Art stepped] 
out of the gallery, out of the museum, off the pedestal, off 
the wall and into the environment, into the city, into the 
social fabric,” he said.
Burgess’ paintings are intensely colorful and full of bold 
imagery, including an arm reaching out of the heavens in 
“The Crocus.” The paintings borrow the blues that belong 
to the ocean and to the sky, the reds of molten copper and 
volcanoes, the black with white specks of a night sky, and 
the white of lilies. No image or detail in the paintings is 
extraneous or arbitrary; for instance, in "The Lotus,” the 
stars are an actual constellation and the Buddha’s pose is 
one of reassurance.
All of Burgess' work is extremely complicated and is 
marked by a worldliness gained from decades of traveling. 
In one installation, Burgess gathered from all over the world 
and mixed together sap of 44 trees, water of 33 rivers, and 
the blood of 33 people among other elements. He poured 
the mixture into two small metal pods and placed one on 
top of the Taygetos Mountains in Greece and released the 
second into the Mediterranean Sea near the mountains.
He also sent the work “Boundless Cubic Lunar Aperture” 
into outer space aboard NASA's space shuttle Discovery in 
1989.
Burgess’ childhood and the way he was raised contributed 
to his fascination with the world. “I grew [up] during the 
Second World War, and the world was very big for me 
because my father was in the South Pacific," Burgess said.
“I got very strange gifts from the Pacific, you know, 
anthropological objects, Boomerangs. My teddy bear 
was a stuffed Koala bear from Australia — a real bear. A 
taxidermy bear was my teddy bear.”
Burgess with his paining Vision Portal: 
"The Rose" is inspired by a vision 
Burgess had in which the Pacific Ocean 
is pierced by a rose-like pole.

---------------------------------------------------

Burgess was also influenced when, not even 5 years 
old, he visited massive aircraft carriers, monumental 
battleships, and even a Japanese two-man submarine 
that's now in a museum in Norfolk, Va.
Because his father was fighting in the war, Burgess 
spent a lot of his early childhood with his grandparents 
and aunts. His grandparents were part of a newspaper- 
publishing family and had a broad view of the world that 
was atypical of the times, given that communication 
of the time was limited to the radio and newsprint. 
Burgess’ grandmother instilled in him from an early age 
an importance for watching the globe and understanding 
what was going on.
"When I went to see my grandmother, I would be asked
— when I was 6 or 7 — what I thought of the Syrian 
situation,” Burgess said, recalling his grandmother with 
her short-wave radio, newspapers, and magazines.
“So, akeady there was this global, 'Don’t you know 
about what’s going on in South America or Japan or 
wherever?”’
Burgess has passed the lessons from his grandmother 
onto his own children and grandchildren, whom he often 
gives art materials to play with while he works in his 
studio.
"My family’s very important to me and my art,” said 
Burgess, who married his wife Janet in 1960. “She’s a 
constant companion and I rarely travel without her.” Even 
when Burgess traveled to Afghanistan in the 1970s, Janet 
and his children accompanied him: “We wanted our kids 
to grow up in a big world,” he said.
Although Burgess indulges in complexity, his paintings 
haven’t confused visitors to the Carnegie Museum. 
Assistant Curator of Education Lucy Stewart described 
the paintings as “one big ball of energy.” In a Carnegie 
Mellon podcast with Burgess, Miriam Seidel, a critic with 
the art magazine Art in America, said, "They’re bright, 
they’re out there.... You can just enter right in and start to 
experience them with whatever you bring to the gallery."
Burgess, who spends a lot of time at the museum talking 
with visitors and is on a first-name basis with the 
security guards, related the reaction of one visitor who 
thought the paintings were “something healing.” Indeed, 
according to Burgess, the four paintings were a raison 
detre ("reason for being") for himself and others while 
violence ravaged the world in the 1960s and the almost 
half-century since. The paintings, along with Quiet Axis, 
helped put man into context in the grand scheme of 
things.
Lest any of his mystical and complex philosophy begin to 
unravel, in 1987 Burgess wrote and published the poetry 
collection Quiet Axis about a set of related artworks of 
the same name; the set includes pieces from around 
the world and is the culmination of 40 years of work, 
which all began with the four paintings at the Carnegie 
Museum.
At his out-of-the-way North Side studio, which is 
sandwiched between a bowling alley ahd a funeral home, 
Burgess has binders that document his other arguments 
and sources of inspiration: lines from Dante's Inferno and 
Milton’s Paradise Lost, in addition to poetry, philosophy, 
and sheets of music. Loyal to his inspiration, Burgess 
has lines and entire poems committed to memory. In 
his office at Carnegie Mellon, he has thousands of books
on myriad subjects as well as dozens of recordings and 
scores of avant-garde music, which has played a great 
role in his life. When Burgess was 15, one of his friends, 
an organist 12 years older than him, would perform the 
monumental works of French composer Olivier Messiaen 
and pieces by Max Reger; in the latter pieces, Reger 
added voices to Bach's fugues (compositions in which 
one theme answers another within the work), which 
already had three, four, or five voices. Later, Burgess 
himself composed and was involved in musical circles, 
particularly around composers John Cage, Nam June 
Paik, Charlotte Moorman, and Maryanne Amacher.
Music and sound make Burgess see colors as he has 
synesthesia, a neurological blurring of the senses. In 
other kinds of synesthesia, people will "taste” sound or 
see different letters of the alphabet in colors. At Burgess’ 
studio, he’ll play Poulenc and ask you to listen for the 
one particular chord that he painted at the top of “The 
Crocus.”
In addition to his artwork, Burgess teaches art students 
at Carnegie Mellon and tries to pass onto them his view 
of the role of the artist in society. He wants his students 
to do more than criticize society through their artwork 
by trying to recreate the fervor of the 1960s, when art 
became a potent element of the protest movement.
Many have compared the war in Iraq that began in 2003 
to Vietnam, a repetition of history that would seem to 
negate — or at least strongly challenge — Burgess' life 
work, which focuses on a protest of the war that affected 
him so strongly.
“It has been like being in an echo chamber — same 
arguments, pretexts, and rhetorical twists —just 
different names and more sophisticated governmental 
evasions and distractions,” Burgess stated in an e-mail. 
"There is little sense of the striving for the 'common 
good’ left.”
Burgess hasn’t found the spark of the generation of 
1968 in the generation of 2008. Burgess said the college 
students of 2008 "are mummified by personalized 
media — cell phones, iPods, BlackBerrys, and computer 
blogging,” and that they don't realize that "it is neither 
cohesive nor effective social communication. The 
dreadful end-process of postmodern methology [of 
criticizing rather than acting] has rendered direct speech 
nearly impossible.”
While the world may be trapped in a historical cycle, 
people have Burgess’ paintings and other artwork, which 
are meant to comfort rather than answer the why of war 
and destruction. Visitors have told Burgess they are 
inspired and comforted by the paintings, and so he, too, 
is comforted.
Despite his interest in war and protesting it, a 
fundamental optimism lies at the heart of Burgess’ work. 
Speaking of hope for the future, as Burgess wrote in one 
of his poems that NASA took into outer space: "O before, 
utterly beforeA^et after, after all foresakeness:/Darkness 
beyond all darkness, even there slightly lifting, The 
Boundless Cube.”
More information and images of Burgess' paintings are

org/exhibitions/exhibit.asp#forum61. The exhibit runs 
through March 23.

The Tartan prepares for its annual 
Junior Promenade (so that’s where 
the word "prom” comes from). With 
all the enthusiasm over the expected 
attendants, be happy that you’re living 
in the 21st century. The article mentions 
that Mr. and Mrs. Pete Adams will 
attend, along with Dot Felkel. The paper 
also asks why Dr. James isn’t coming. 
Maybe Dot Felkel broke his heart.
Carnegie Tech ends its winning streak 
in a game against the Pitt Panthers. The 
ever-consoling Tartan proclaims that the 
Tech offense couldn’t move well without 
the presence of first-year Bill Soffa, a 
star player, thus accounting for losing 
to Pitt. If I were a '50s writer for the 
Tartan, I would entitle the article “Soffa 
From Victory.”
After a period of debate, the 1983 
final exam schedule is released. After 
a heartfelt student editorial calling for 
more reading days, the faculty buckles 
down and agrees to give students 
Thursday and Friday to read up for their 
tests. I guess that students were having 
a tough time in their “Reaganomics” 
and “Blinding People with Science” 
classes.
After a year and a half of searching, 
Carnegie Mellon finally finds a new 
head librarian, Dr. Gloriana St. Ctair. 
The librarian’s main concerns are to 
establish an electronic library system 
and to resolve space issues in Hunt. 
Whether there is more space in Hunt is 
debatable, but the new sleeping pods 
at least give more places to space out.
A Tartan writer, still shocked and in 
disbelief from Carnegie Melion’s snow 
day last week, asks students how they 
spent their time during the monumental 
occasion. Responses were varied; one 
student said he drank until 4 a.m., while 
another said he used the time to finish 
his programming assignment. My guess 
is that most students fell in the middle 
somewhere, drinking until 2 a.m. and 
finishing half of their assignments.
Smoking, the issue that just won’t quit, 
makes it into Tartan headlines yet again. 
Talk of a campus-wide smoking ban is 
snuffed out, as 52 percent of students 
voted against the proposal that would 
ban smoking on campus by 2010. Still, 
the administration succeeded in pulling 
cigarettes from Entropy last September. 
Now students have to walk to the
7-Eleven at Pitt, which means exercising 
their lungs before destroying them.

Edgy yet elegant
Fashion tips to look classy (even if it’s just for class)
Style is never limited to a set of constraints. In fact, it is when 
conventional rules are broken that new trends and changes 
come about. Around campus, most students dress for comfort, 
but sophomore architecture majors Hye Yeon Noh and Katherine 
Kokoska manage to be both practical and fashion forward.
Noh successfully redefines lengths and proportions to make her 
clothes work. Playing with cropped pieces is tricky; sometimes 
it emphasizes the wrong parts and ends up weighing an entire 
outfit down. However, Noh's cropped teal blazer hits right 
above her hips, and the cut of the jacket draws attention to the 
smallest part of her waist, instantly creating a slender silhouette. 
The sleeves on her jacket add another dimension to give her 
overall look a sense of constrained volume.
To prevent shortened pieces from truncating the body, Noh 
makes great use of tunic pieces. These shirts alone can 
sometimes double as a mini-dress, but.most often they are used 
to balance out the body. Noh cleverly wears hers to streamline 
her blazer, but the extra details, like the side pockets on the 
tunic and raw hem, are charming. Further elongating her body, 
Noh again uses contrasting proportions by wearing tights to not 
only keep her tunic from being too short, but also to lengthen 
her legs, and make her outfit winter appropriate.
Reinterpreting the big bows that appeared in countless spring 
2008 fashion shows, Noh’s thick wool black scarf, flecked with 
white, looks chic and fresh from the runway. Finding new uses 
for accessories are unexpected and almost always guaranteed 
to be innovative. Her rich velvet blazer makes great use out of 
a traditionally more old-fashioned material, but because it is 
cropped and cut to be trendier, the blazer is not aging.
Kokoska is the perfect example of someone who has fun getting 
dressed up. She shows off her personal flair with color and 
accessories, allowing her to personalize her wardrobe without 
making severe changes.
“My look is shabby chic and vintage- inspired,” Kokoska said, 
and for long hours in class and studio, her look is fluid enough to 
move and lounge around whenever needed.
Kokoska wears a simple beige pea coat with dark skinny 
jeans. This neutral look is commonly seen around campus, but 
what sets her apart from others is her use of vibrant and loud 
accessories, which gives her style an eccentric twist. The bright 
pink bandana around her neck draws attention to her face and 
is quirky but still provides coverage.
Kokoska’s peacock-printed rainboots give her outfit the extra 
kick. She said that the fun print "casualizes” her otherwise 
classic outfit, and combined with the practicality of the boots, it 
is appropriate for the rainiest of days but does not compromise 
her uniqueness. In addition to her boots, she adds a white 
jeweled vintage ring and a fur-lined hat. Such elements may not 
seem like they would match, but sometimes clashing is a great 
thing; it takes away the seriousness of most winter outfits and 
reflects an equally fun, funky personality.
The use of vintage and thrifty items makes Kokoska's look 
modem, yet retro. Although most might shy away from loud 
contrast and consider this look a little too crazy, the color and 
pieces all blend together in a wild but subtle way.
Style should always reflect personality, culture, and creativity. 
Noh shows off her chic, feminine style with a bold mixture of 
proportions and textures. Proportions are hard to get right, 
but the idea is to elongate the body using opposite lengths.
Her style is elegant and confident, and always a great way to 
incorporate new looks into existing wardrobes.
Similarly, Kokoska makes sure to include trendy but basic pieces 
in her outfit, creating a fun, laid-back vibe. She then adds on 
eye-catching, whimsical accessories that separate her look from 
others.
No matter how dramatic or subtle the details, any outfit can 
instantly look eclectic yet chic.
