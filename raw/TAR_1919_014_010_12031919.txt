TRANSCONTINENTAL OIL CO. 
OFFERS PRIZES TO THE 
ARCHITECTURAL SCHOOL
That the work done in the past by 
students of architecture at Carnegie 
Tech has won the notice of outsiders 
is once more forcibly brought to mind 
by the fact that the Transcontinental 
Oil Company has recently offered 
prizes aggregating one thousand dol- 
dars to students of architecture at the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology for 
the best designs for a gasoline service 
station. The preliminary competition 
ends Saturday at midnight, and the 
authors of the best designs will then 
iin allowed, to develop thir ideas 
further.
The prize money will be divided as 
follows: First prize, $300; second 
prize, $200; third prize, .$150, and 
several prizes of $50 each. It is a 
great honor that the architectural 
school of Carnegie Tech should be 
chosen by this company as the most 
fertile field for the competition.
The company wished to develop 
something entirely original in the way 
of a gasoline service station, as' dif­
ferent as possible from the type 
which has become so common along 
our highways, and for this reason in­
stigated the competition among the 
embryo architects in preference to 
soliciting the aid of some well-known 
exponents of the profession.
M. Nl. 0. ASSEMBLY
TO Y. Mí. C. A.
The first part of the weekly assem­
bly was devoted to Y. W. C. A. Miss 
Mary Jones presided. After a piano 
and vocal solo Mrs. Conant of the 
Central Y. W. spoke to the girls a 
few moments. She urged all the girls 
to go to the Hospitality House on 
Fifth Avenue on Sunday afternoons 
and make a Margaret Morrison after­
noon. After Mrs. Conant’s talk Har­
riet Stone gave a brief survey of the 
visit to the student government con­
ference at Wilson College, Chambers- 
burg. Typewritten copies of the min­
utes of the conference have been 
made and distributed so that all the 
girls will have an opportunity of 
learning of the work done by the 
conference.
Forty colleges were represented at 
the conference. Various forms of 
student government were represented. 
The government of Simmond’s Col­
lege was very similar to that of Mar­
garet Morrison. At the next assem­
bly concrete ideas which may aid in 
bettering our own form of student 
government are to be presented and 
openly discussed. Agnes Russell, the 
junior representative, told of the 
social activities of the conference. 
The conference next year will meet 
at Elmira College, Elmira, N. Y.
Several announcements were made 
and assembly closed with the singing 
of “Dear Old Tech”.
ELECTRICALS HOLO VERY
The regular monthly meeting of the
A. I. E. E. was held on the evening 
of November 25 in Room 11 Machin­
ery Hall. After a short business 
meeting the speakers for the evening, 
Messrs. G. G. Bell, Mechanical Engin­
eer, Geo. S. Humphreys, and H. W. 
McRobbie, Eelectrical Engineers—all 
of the West Penn Power Co., gave 
talks on the electrical and mechanical 
features of the West Penn Power 
Co.’s new plant at Springdale. The 
subjects were developed in detail and 
were profusely illustrated with lant­
ern slides and photographs, proving 
to be a source of much valuable and 
interesting information of a very 
practical nature. The local Branch 
owes much to these men for their ef­
forts to make the meeting the success 
that it proved to be.
The value of these meetings to any 
one interested in electrical matters is 
unquestionable and all members of the 
three upper classes in this department 
should avail themselves of their op­
portunity to attend.
REPRESENTATIVE CHOSEN 
FOR STUDENT CONFERENCE
The four delegates to the Des 
Moines Conference were elected last 
week. The following girls were chos­
en to represent their respective 
classes:
Senior:
Eleanor Cox.
Junior:
Eleanor McCarson. 
Sophomore:
Gladys Ramsay.
Freshman:
Lillian Coleman.
TO 
THEIR ANNUAL BALL
After two years of silence, the 
Quaker Commercials of Science will 
burst into public view again with a 
repetition of their famous annual 
dance, last held in 1917 at the Oak- 
mont Boat Club. Several of the orig­
inal Quaker Commercials are in 
school again and, true to form, they 
are going to brighten things up gen­
erally. This year the dance will take 
place in the ball room of Duquesne 
Garden on January 16th and it prom­
ises to be better, if such is possible, 
than the last.
The patrons and patronesses select­
ed this year to honor the Quakers are 
Mr. and Mrs. H. .1. McCorkle, to rep­
resent the school at large; Mr. and 
Mrs. George H. Follows, Mr. Howard 
C. Kidd and Mr. Earl F. Reed, all of 
whom are well known honorary 
Quaker Commercials. That this will 
be the dance event of the year is evi­
denced by th ecommittee at work— 
Irvin N. King of Sigma Rho, well 
known in fraternity dance circles; 
Dave (Lefty) Abrams of the Coffey 
Club, and Dave Shilliday of Theta Xi 
and C. R. Dobsin, the two latter hav­
ing served on the committee in 1917. 
Representatives have been appointed 
to cover the school so far, as follows:
Bob Seidel, in Industries and Oph- 
elum; Dave Evans, Woodlawn Club 
and Junior Commercials; C. J. Cop­
ley. Sonh Commercials; C. It. Little, 
Delta Upsilon; Marcus Fair, Sienna 
Nu; Jim Giffen, Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
In line with previous procedure, 
specialties will be introduced and ev­
ery effort is being put forth to secure 
novelties. Among other things, there 
will be some exhibition dancing of 
note. Several surprises will be sprung 
in the course of the evening. The 
committee is making arrangements to 
handle a record-breaking attendance 
this year, as every one is invited to 
come out and look the Quaker Com­
mercials over.
TECH INSTRUCTORS MAY 
APPEAL TO F
The following item, clipped from a 
local paper, interests the instructors, 
and through them the students of 
Tech so closely, that it is deemed 
hardly suitable, to disregard the mat­
ter discussed. It is one on which, 
naturally, an organ of this nature 
does not care to comment; but the 
facts of the case seem to be such 
common property in the city that at 
least a mention of the contention is 
not amiss.
The following article appeared in 
the Pittsburgh Dispatch:
A delegation of three members of 
the faculty of Carnegie Tech will bo 
sent directly to New York to negoti­
ate directly with members of the Car­
negie Corporation regarding salary 
increases if the raise, which is looked 
for soon, is not a substantial one and 
does not cover the entire faculty, it 
was declared yesterday by teachers of 
the school.
The committee, composed of Dr. L.
C. Grondahl, Prof. Charles Watkins, 
Mrs. Irene Conrad and Prof. H. L. 
Lang, which was appointed last week 
by the faculty to devise means of ob­
taining increases in slaries, met yes­
terday afternoon. Members of the 
committee would not discuss the 
meeting, but it was declared by those 
close to them that, as it is thought 
the trustees are not intending to offer 
acceptable raises, the subject of send­
ing the delegates to the foundation 
over the heads of the trustees was 
favorably discussed.
Col. Samuel Harden Church, mem­
ber of the Carnegie Corporation, who 
attended the annual meeting of the 
corporation in New York last week, 
declared last night that no mention 
was made during the meeting of the 
demand for increases in salaries, and 
that the corporation has no power to 
raise salaries. He stated that the mat­
ter is under the control of the board 
of trustees here, and that any mem­
bers of the Tech faculty who believe 
that appealing to members of the cor­
poration in New York would be effec­
tual are misinformed regarding the 
power of the corporation.
It was declared yesterday by a 
member of the faculty, whose identity 
for obvious reasons cannot be divulg­
ed, that the general feeling among the 
teachers, caused by various utterances 
of trustees, is that the increases to be 
offered are to be small and are not to 
materially affect the entire faculty 
body. Such increases will not be ac­
cepted, he declared.
Faculty Aroused.
“There is no doubt in the minds of 
those who have observed the faculty 
members of late that they will not 
hesitate to take the strongest steps 
to secure relief from intolerable con­
ditions/' the teacher said. “Only the 
prompt action of the administration 
will prevent them from taking the

FAVOR 
VOLUNTARY SYSTEM
The new plan of voluntary physical 
education which has been started by 
Mr. Hazel has found great favor 
among the men in school who are not 
out for the athletic teams particular­
ly among the freshman class. To date 
some two and fifty men have won 
points and much interest has been 
aroused by the possibilities of the 
plan. The work so far has been most­
ly in Section 111 which is composed of 
Dipping, Chinning, Hand Vault, Dive 
and Roll and the regular Gym work. 
In the dipping the record of 1.2 is held 
by Merts (freshman) while the Dive 
and Roll record of nine feet has been 
equalled by seven men. In the work­
ing of the plan some interesting facts 
have already been noticed, principally 
of which is that Mr. Husky man is not 
always the strongest or best develop­
ed. A question has been raised as to 
whether the classes deteriorate as 
they progress thru Tech and it has 
been suggested that ten men be picked 
from each of the four classes in Tech 
to compete in certain events listed in 
the plan. A proportionate number of 
men to be chosen from each school. 
The list of events are Chinning, Dip­
ping, Dive and Roll, Hand Vault and 
25-yard burden run. The score in the 
first four to be total of the ten men 
of each class. The fifth event to count 
'1 for first, 3 for second, 2 for third and 
1 for fourth. Mi-. Hazel would like 
to know how the different classes feel 
about such a contest.
The next trials for points in the 
voluntary plan will be Friday, Decem­
ber 5th, at 4:45. The events are chin­
ning, dipping, and dive and roll.
At this time when basketball work 
is in progress let us state the require­
ments of event No. 14 in the Plan. 
Any student who is a member of a 
class, Fraternity, Non-fraternity, Dor­
mitory or any independent school 
team playing not less than four sched­
uled games is entitled to a credit of 
ten points provided said students plays 
in one-third of the games and attend 
two-thirds of the team practices.
TECH FOOTBALL PLAYER 
NEW FARRELL DIRECTOR
Joe Baldwin, right halfback of the 
Carnegie Tech football team the past 
season has been elected athletic di­
rector of the Farrell, Pa., high school, 
succeed W. J. Downs, who will go 
to India. Baldwin will graduate at 
Tech December 16, and will take up 
his duties at Farrell a few days later.
Baldwin will have entire charge of 
athletics and will also teach chem­
istry. His first task will be to turn 
out a basketball team to compare 
with Farrell High teams of the past 
two years, which have been cham­
pions of Mercer county. Four letter 
men will form the nucleus of the 
squad. Baldwin is a brother of Roger 
Baldwin, today elected captain of the 
1920 Allegheny College football team.

INTERFRATERNITY DANCE 
SHOULD BE A SUCCESS
The committee appointed by the 
Inter-Fraternity Council announces 
that everything is all set for the best 
inter-fraternity dance ever held at 
Carnegie Tech. The dance, which is 
to be informal, will be held from nine 
till one in the Duquesne Garden ball 
room, Friday, December 5. Ollie 
Riehl will jazz the latest song hits 
including those from Bohemia Unlim­
ited, and to those who like classy 
music, this statement means a great 
deal.
•\ cordial invitation to attend is ex­
tended to members of national fra­
ternities not having chapters at Tech. 
They may procure tickets from the 
committee which consists of M. W. 
Pohlmeyer (Arts), chairman; N. P. 
Rice (Ails) and R. Russell (Science).
COUNTRY FAIR WAS
HEAD OF DEPARTMENT ILL
Thomas Ward Stevens, head of the 
School of Drama, has been unable to 
meet his classes for the last few days 
on account of illness.
The country fair held for the one 
night of November 25, surpassed any 
fair ever held before. All the best 
parts of all fairs ever held were gath­
ered together in the Recreation Hall 
at M. M. The fat lady and the thin 
lady were exhibited in .side shows, 
while a long line was always to be 
found in front of the gypsy fortune 
teller’s booth. If only the fortunes 
that wise one told would come true 
there would never be a gloomy person 
around M. M.
The most important event was the 
horse races. Quite a good deal of bet­
ting was going on and excitement ran 
high. After a most thrilling race “71” 
won and was awarded a wonderful 
prize. The jockeys were quite a choice 
lot and rode their horses most grace­
fully.
Quite a few noted county figures at­
tended the fair. Sis Hopkins and sev­
eral of her sisters were there. A dash­
ing 2nd Lieut., just back from war, 
made quite a stir among the ladies 
and caused quite a good deal of jeal­
ousy. “His” attentions to the county 
vamp and to a gypsy beauty were very 
marked. The county police force had 
quite a time keeping order in the 
booth where a roulette wheel was 
found and he, or rather it, had to 
make several arrests.
The student government was re­
sponsible for the fair and those who 
worked for the success of the party 
are to be congratulated. Such ex­
pressions as “Best time I’ve ever had 
here,” “More fun than enough,” 
“When will the next one be,” were 
heard by many and go to prove what 
a success the party was. The chair­
men of the different committees were 
Janet Rutherford, Barbara Endres 
and Helen Reid. Special mention must 
be made of the attractive and unique 
posters which announced the attrac­
tions at the fair.
TRATNSCOIEL.
While coaching the basketball team 
Monday evening in the gymnasium, 
Coach Hazel injured his ankle in such 
a manner as to confine him to his 
home for a few days at least. He 
may be out on crutches in a day or 
two.
The members of the Drama School, 
former classmates and friends of 
Wm. F. Mulligan, who appears here 
this week at the Duquesne Theatre, 
attended the opening performance of 
the play, “Black and White”, in a 
body last night. They occupied al­
most the entire center section of the 
orchestra tloor, and gave “Mully”, as 
he is papularly known, a rousing re­
ception.
The enthusiasm shown at the per­
formance was not confined to his per­
sonal friends, however, as his splendid 
acting in the role of Pete, the “yellow 
nigger” whom the mob wishes to hang 
brought applause from the entire au­
dience.
Mr. Mulligan went to New York 
this fall to get a position, and makes 
his debut on the professional stage in 
this play, in which his thorough train­
ing at Carnegie Tech stands him in 
good stead.
The following comments concern­
ing his acting and the theatre-party 
for him appear in the Pittsburgh 
dailies:
“The Negro boy, Pete, is played 
by William F. Mulligan, a former 
student of the drama class at Car­
negie School of Technology, and one 
of the pleasant incidents of the eve­
ning was found in the loyal admira­
tion expressed by a group of com­
rades of that class who occupied the 
body of the house and gave the young 
actor a cordial welcome. The role 
is a small but pivotal one, requiring 
the expression in action rather than 
words of tense emotion and fear. Mr. 
Mulligan creates an accurate sense of 
these.”
“William F. Mulligan, who was a 
former student at Carnegie Tech, is 
handling the role of Pete, who is ac­
cused of an astrocious crime, and his 
work is commendable and clever 
throughout the entire performance.”
After the performance the largest 
crowd that has besieged the Duquesne 
stage door in a long time waited im­
patiently for the rear “star” of the 
evening to appear—and when ho final­
ly did arrive he was royally welcomed.
The crowd, with two heralds in the 
lead, started up Penn Avenue, and 
from there made their way to the 
New China Restaurant, causing a 
good deal of excitement among the 
passers-by on the trip.
After a supper at which the guest 
of honor could do little else than 
answer questions and say “Thanks” 
to congratulations, the party broke 
up at about two o’clock.
COLLEGE PRESIDENT 
ADVISES STUDENTS
(By Jacob Gould Schurman, President 
of Cornell University.)
A man is more than his work. 
Wherever, therefore, human beings 
come together,, to engage in work, 
other interests spring up, find expres­
sion and receive attention.
Wo say that the good citizen is the 
man who not only does faithfully his 
daily work, but who gives some cart 
also to the interests of the community 
in which he lives and of the state 
and nation to which lie belongs.
Some men and women devote more 
time to those public subjects than 
others. The man who pursues them 
to the neglect of his own proper work 
will find it difficult to secure or tp hold 
permanently a position in the eco­
nomic system of production and dis­
tribution.
Somewhere a line must be drawn 
between the two groups of competing 
claims. There is a happy medium if 
men can only find it.
What takes place in that state on 
a large scale finds its counterpart in 
the university.
The university is primarily a place 
to study. As an institution, study is 
what justifies its existence. But when 
young men and young women congre­
gate in an institution of learning, they 
quickly discover that they have inter­
ests outside the class room and apart 
from hours which they reserve for in­
tellectual work. The great majority 
of their interests are entirely proper 
and worthy of cultivation, while some 
of them are pre-eminently important.
To the latter class belong solicitude 
for the name and fame of the Univer­
sity, and all efforts which tend to pro­
mote a healthful democratic and noble 
spirit in the academic community. 
Such a spirit is not only commend­
able in itself, but invaluable to the 
University.
It is not public service of that sort 
which the undergraduate has in mind 
when he speaks of student activities. 
That phrase suggests almost exclu­
sively the idea of athletic and social 
activities. And while these are normal 
and proper interests for young men, 
and some of them for young women 
too, they have tended to usurp too 
large a portion of the student’s time 
and energy.
Sometimes, indeed, one finds it ser­
iously stated and claimed in student 
publications, that an undergraduate 
receives as much benefit from these 
so-called student activities as from de­
votion to those intellectual activities 
which the university was founded to 
maintain and advance.
I have always regarded this view as 
utterly false an mischievious. And, 
to give the student a sense of propor­
tion and to recall his to his proper 
work, I coined a phrase a few years 
ago which seems to have lodged in the 
mind of our community.
I said that, essentially considered, 
the “students' activities are studious 
activities.” I meant of course to bring 
out in this somewhat epigrammatic 
way the vital and all important fact 
that a student was here to study, and 
that no other activity whatever could 
take the place of that fundamental 
duty.
It is through and by study that the

CLUB’S SMOKER PROOVES
Any student in Tech who is taking 
the building course, and was not at 
this smoker missed it real treat. Only 
those who woro presont can appreciate 
this statement.
The committee was fortunato 
enough, through th oholp of Col. S. 
II. Church, to secure a cozy little room 
in one corner of the University Club’s 
Headquarters, Bigelow Boulevard, In 
which to hold it.
Something was doing every minute. 
Solos, mass singing and pointed 
speeches featured. By the way, real 
cigars and cigarettes wore there in 
plentiful numbers. Mr. Beck, a Tech 
student and widoly roputod as a vio­
linist. gave several selections, accom­
panied by Mr. Dufty. Mr. .1, B. Kelly 
was the principal speaker. His talk 
showed Tech's building men what a 
great field they were preparing to 
enter and of the big opportunities it 
afforded to the right man. Other 
speeches were made by Doan Morris, 
Professor Dunnell's, and members of 
the club. Mr. R. I,. King, a member 
of the 20th Division, A. E. F. and now 
at Tech, gave a very interesting ac­
count of his service in France. Mr. 
Trohy of the 28th Div. A. E. F. and 
also a Tech student, gave a short talk 
on how trenches were constructed 
around No-Man's-Land. He said that 
these trenches must have been built 
by Tech men for in every instance 
they held back the onrush of the 
mighty German army. A fine lunch 
topped the climax. It was evident 
that the committee in charge was on 
the job for everything was done up 
in Tech style.”
ASSEMBLY TAKES UP 
ATHLETIC SITUATION
At the Science assembly last Wed­
nesday the question of athletics at 
Tech was taken up. The first thing 
done was the election of the Science 
School representative for the com­
mittee which is to take up the ques­
tion and make recommendations to 
the administration. Nichol, Paffen- 
bach and Phil Marshall were nominat­
ed but the latter two declined in favor 
of Nichol. A speech was called for, 
so Nichol gave his views on the ath­
letic situation. He told of the lack 
of athletic facilities adn the bad con­
ditions of what the school does have. 
He pointed out the gym example, tell­
ing of the small space, the poor locker 
facilities and the dirty condition. He 
also pointed out other difficulties 
hindering the coaches and teams such 
as interference from the administra­
tion beyond reasonable limits.
The other matter taken up was the 
voting on three questions:
1. Do you wish to continue foot­
ball as an inter-collegiate sport at the 
Cranegie Institute of Technology?
2. Do you wish to continue bas­
ketball, and track as inter-collegiate 
sports?
Do you desire to have Mr. 
Walter Steffen as coach for the foot­
ball team, season of 1.920?
Practically all the votes turned in 
were yes on all three questions. There 
were a few noes but so few as to be 
almost negligible.

WHAT ABOUT IT?
Six thousand chosen students and professors from practically every 
college and university of the United States and Canada will meet in Des 
Moines for live days this coming New Year’s.
Seven similur student conventions have been held in the past at four- 
year intervuls. This is the first which has been held for six years, and for 
many reasons bids fair to be in a class by itself.
This is the first large gathering of students since the war. They arc 
meeting together for the purpose of actually facing the situation in the world 
today and of considering the responsibility of the American college men and 
women in regard to the serious problems which must be solved. If the 
colleges are to be sincere in their protestations of interest in world service 
during the war, they owe it to themselves and to the country to have their 
full delegates at Des Moines.
Registrations already received from all parts of the country show that 
practically every college which has hud opportunity to learn of the Conven­
tion is planning to send its representatives, and many have already asked for 
more than they are entitled to.
If the real possibilities of this gathering are to be realized, it is essential 
not only that the right men and women be chosen as delegates in each insti­
tution, but also that the whole college become acquainted with the nature 
and purpose of the Convention. With probably six thousand representative 
students and professors from North America and live hundred foreign stu­
dents from forty dill’erent nations as delegates, and with many of tin- lore- 
most Christian loaders and statesmen from all parts of the world as speakers, 
it is needless to say that this Convention bids fair to prove the foremost event 
in the student world this year, something which no college can alTord to miss.
Men of Tech what are you going to «1«) about this important matter? 
The co-eds have rather taken all by surprise with the great rapidity with 
which they have decided upon this question. They have already elocted four 
representatives. What have the men done? Elected a chairman and tint was 
the last that was heard.
11, is hardly necessary to emphasize the importance of this convention. 
At a mooting where every college and university in the country is represented, 
(larnogio Tech surely wants to bo represented also. Indications are that a 
large majority of other schools have already registered their representatives 
and have the choleo of seats and otherwise.
“Hotter lato than never” is a wise old adage, but ¡I is hotter to bo “an 
hour early than a minute late”. We are waiting patiently to hear from the 
committee. What Is to bo dono?
A GRADUATE MANAGER.
It is gratifying to see how much interest the alumni have taken in the 
athletic situation and this assures us all the more of their co-operation and 
support. Never before has such an interest been shown ¡is well as the readi­
ness to assist wherever possible in bettering athletic conditions. It is realized 
that our alumni body is young and small in comparison with that of most 
other schools. They are coming into their own, however, and should be com 
plimented on their splendid attitude.
In conversation with a few of the alumni body, the writer has discovered 
that the concensus of opinion is that a graduate manager is the most neces­
sary man to help in bettering the general condition of student activities, 
athletic as well as non-athletic. They realize, as well as we, that the present 
authorities serving in this capacity have done well and are doing their best 
under the circumstances. However, the situation is such that it leads to 
believing htat a graduate manager who attends to nothing but this matter 
can do so more efficiently than one who is filling two or more positions at 
the same time.
In having a graduate manager, a definite system is.perfected whereby 
all the activities are run. Any one visiting the activities oftice now would 
realize that it is a deserted and unsightly place. Why? No one there to 
take care of it; to keep the files in their proper order or to keep the office, 
in general, orderly. Besides a definite system of all expenditures on athletic 
and other supplies is attained which, the alumni and students as well have 
reason to believe, does not exist now7.
Secondly, the filling of this vacant position eliminates the shifting of re­
sponsibility which undoubtedly does occur when more than one person acts 
in the same capacity.
The opinion is, therefore, that conditions will be better when a graduate 
manager is secured. This office was in force up until the S. A. T. C. regime 
when ther ewas no need of such an office but everything has returned to 
nearly a normal basis and there is reason to believe that this would better 
future conditions.

MURADTHE TURKISH CIGARETTE
ÜROM Bagdad to 
J- Frisco, men in every 
walk of life greatly 
prefer pure Turkish 
cigarettes.
The fact that “ordinary” cigar­
ettes cost a trifle less, sometimes 
to one’s pocket, but never to 
e.
Murads are 100% pure Turkish — the 
world’s most famous tobacco for cigarettes.
Don’t wound your pride or scramble your taste for 
a trifling saving.
Murads are worth more than they cost—and you 
don’t have to sneak the package in and out of your 
pocket in any company—you know what we mean.
At each meeting the Alumni dis­
cussed the proposed increase in tuition 
fees, the athletic policy which should 
be followed at Tech, and the manner 
in which they could cooperate in fur­
thering the Alma Mater.
This is the beginning of increased 
alumni interest; in atl'airs on the camus 
which will react favorably in strength­
ening the alumni organization.
Our former graduate manager of 
athletics, Fred E. Foster ’08, is assist­
ant to the president of the Santa

The night students of the School 
of Applied Design met on Monday, 
November 17th, after a meeting had 
been called to order by last year’s 
president—Mr. K. B. Weber. After 
the reading of the minutes by Mr. F. 
C. Wilharm, acting secretary, the 
meeting proceeded with the election 
of officers for the ensuing year.
Mr. K. B. Weber of the Architec­
tural Department was re-elected pres­
ident by a unanimous vote. Mr. Stew­
ard of the Painting and Decorating 
will fill the office of vice president. 
Mr. L. R. Dyer of the Architectural, 
former secretary and treasurer, will 
again serve in that capacity. Mr. 
Fred C. Wilharm of the Painting and 
Decorating was re-elected represen­
tative of the Student Activities Board. 
Mr. Willson of the Architectural De­
partment will represent the night 
classes on the Board of Control. For 
the Thistle Board, the following stu­
dents were elected:
1. Miss R. Bruce, Painting and 
Decorating.
2. Miss A. Klein, Drama.
3. Miss J. Davy, Painting and 
Decorating.
Mr. Owen of the Painting and Deco­
rating was elected representative on 
the Tartan.
Much is anticipated from this selec­
tion of officers, and what the night 
students expect, they can confidently 
rest assured will be realized. The re­
elected president—“Dutch” Weber— 
is well known by all the students as 
one who does things, for he has held 
this office for the past two years. 
Through his interest in the school, 
the students have benefited in many 
ways and the Annual Inter-Night 
School Dance, which was always cred­
ited as being a success in every way, 
was originated by him.
Mr. L. R. Dyer as Secretary-Treas- 
urer, is the very man to augment the 
treasury of this organization by the 
proper collection of the members’ 
dues.
For Student Activities representa­
tion—there is no one more capable 
than Mr. Wilharm. He will look after 
the night students’ interests in the 
fullest measure, as he has during the 
past two years. He succeeded in mak­
ing the Inter-Night School Dance “a 
free affair”. Mr. Wilharm is also 
president of the Night Tech Design 
Club, which is now being re-organized, 
through which the members had very 
enjoyable sketching tours.
Miss R. Bruce is known to be one 
of the most active students in the 
Design School as was shown last year 
by her selling more Thistles than any 
one else in the Night School. She 
is also holding office as seeretary- 
treasurer of the Night Tech Design 
Club, and the students can rest as­
sured that she, with the cooperation 
of the Misses Klein and Davy, wili 
justly represent them in the 1920 
Thistle.
Mi-. Willson, a former day student, 
was always among the “activities” and 
the night students can depend upon 
him to fill his office with the greatest 
zeal.
The night classes of the Applied 
Design School should bo highly com 
mended on their selection of officers 
for the coming year, for each student 
seems to be amply qualified to fill his 
appointed office.

QUITE CLEVER
One of the most refreshing inci­
dents of the past week was a dainty 
little jewel which appeared in the 
columns of our esteemed contempor­
ary across the valley in a recent issue.
We are to consider ourselves flat­
tered, for apparently we are now al­
lowed to gaze upon the inside work­
ings of the game.
From this rare gem we learn: “So
we put in the scrubs in the first half 
and let old Tech make a touchdown. 
So we put in the regulars and maybe 
we didn’t show them up. Why, with 
Andy and T. J. Davies and Speedo 
and a few othrs they couldn’t do a 
thing, etc., etc.”
Ah! How clever. How to win a 
game; put in the csrubs in the first 
half.
But now let us see how Morrow, 
McCracken and Davies and Laugh- 
ran “showed them up”.
We quote from the local press:
“Breman hit the line for 3 yards. 
Breman made one more at center. A 
double pass, Breman to Davies, whose 
forward pass to Laugh ran was butted 
to the ground. Davies was smeared 
for a 7-yard loss. Tech’s ball on her 
own 32-yard line.
Fletcher ran right end for 18 yards. 
Marshall made 3 at center. Loomis 
added 2 more. Fletcher’s pass to God 
den netted 25 more. Marshall hit the 
line for 6 yards. Fletcher failed at 
left end. Marshall made a yard on a 
fake pass. Loomis made a first down 
on Pitt’s end for 2 yards.”
Apparently an oversight on the 
part of our Pitt observer.
However we can overlook much in 
that first half, and if there is a note 
of hysteria in their comment (?) we 
can forgive that too. Tech had pro­
vided other attractions besides 92- 
yard runs.
Anyway they came off with a heav­
ier score, both on the grid and police 
blotter and what more could they 
ask in an afternoon?

WORLD’S TWENTY
GREATEST MEN
The late Andrew Carnegie was once 
asked to give a list of the world’s 
twenty greatest men. viewed from 
tlicir contribution to civilization. A 
newspaper reprints the list the iron­
master submitted:
Shakespeare; Morton, discoverer of 
ether; Jcnner, discoverer of vaccina­
tion; Neilson, inventor of hot blast 
in foundries; Lincoln; Burns; Guten­
berg, inventor of printing; Edison, 
applier of electricity; Siemens, inven­
tor of water meter; Bessemer, inven­
tor of steel process; Columbus; Watt, 
improver of steam engine; Bell, in­
ventor of telephone; Arkwright, in­
ventor of cotton spinner; Franklin, 
discoverer of electricity; Murdock, 
first to use coal illuminant; Har- 
reaves, inventor of spinning jenny; 
Stephenson, inventor of rotary en­
gine; Symington, inventor of rotary 
engine.
Two poets, one discovered, one hu­
manitarian, and sixteen inventors. 
Nine of the twenty were Englishmen, 
four Scotchmen, two Germans, one 
Italian, and four Americans.
Carnegie was decidedly a practical
an, and it is not unnatural that his 
list should be mainly of practical men.
Critics take exception to several of 
his choice. One English scholar re­
gretted that he had never heard of 
Mr. Carnegie’s inventors. Few peo­
ple, for instance, know anything 
about Siemens, Symington, or Mushet.
Like the many selections for a “five- 
foot shelf” which appeared after 
President Eliot of Harvard submitted 
his muhc-discussed list of books many 
lists of the world’s “twenty greatest 
ment” followed Mr. Carnegie’s.
Perhaps the fairest was one ar­
ranged by W. T. Stead, who received 
and tabulated the most popular as fol­
lows, in order of their preference:
Shakespeare, Columbus, Gutenberg, 
Newton, Caesar, Darwin, Dante, 
Stephenson, Michael Angelo, Frank­
lin, Watt, Moses, Homer, Buddha, 
Aristotle, Socrates', St. Paul, Con­
fucius, Luther.
These lists were compiled before 
the war. No doubt their authors 
would change them now in favor of 
some of the great men the world con­
flict produced.

MILLION SEALS
SOLD ALREADY.
Allegheny County has bought one- 
tt nth of its quota of 10,000,000 Red 
Cross Christmas seals when chairman 
of the many booths throughout the 
county reported the receipts from the 
first day of the sale to county head­
quarters in the Union Arcade last 
night. Edward A. Woods, chairman 
of the county committee in charge of 
the sale, warned workers not to be 
over optimistic as a result of the re­
ports of the first day sale because 
heavy purchasers of seals were ex­
pected to result through supporters of 
the anti-tuberculosis fight buying 
their entire holiday supply of seals 
early in the sale,
“Even if the sales should average a 
million a day, 10 days would bo re­
quired to sell Allegheny County’s 
quota,” said Mr. Woods, “and the sales 
reported yesterday do not accurately 
represent the total sales at booths. In­
cluded in the million seals sold are 
400,000 which have been purchased by 
mail and for which checks have come 
into the county headquarters.”
Heavy sales were reported by the 
booths in downtown department 
stores. Reports are still to come from 
some of the booths in the suburban 
districts.
Buyers were warned once again, at 
the request of postal authorities, not 
to put the Christmas seals on envel­
opes near the posttage stamps. The 
seals should be placed on the backs 
of envelopes, it was explained, and 
when used on Christmas packages 
should be placed at a distance from 
the postage stamps.
“1 doubt if many people realize to 
the full extent the double purpose of 
the seal sale,” said Mr. Woods. “The 
money derived from the sale of seals 
is used in Allegheny County to cure 
and to prevent tuberculosis. Thus the 
purchase of seals directly prevents 
the disease which costs 1,500 lives 
yearly in the cocnty. But the use of 
the seals on holiday mail is fully as 
important as their purchase. Through 
the educational campaign which has 
been carried on all over America and 
intensively in Alleghency County by 
the Tuberculosis League, the public 
has come to learn that the seal rep­
resents the organziod fight of trained 
workers against tuberculosis and that 
the simple method of preventing tu- 
beculosis, taught by those workers, is 
‘Fresh air, rest and cleanliness.’ ”

MUSEUM 10 RECEIVE
LARGE BIRD COLLECTION
Three collections of birds made in 
South America for the Carnegie Mu­
seum, each numbering between 2,000 
and 3,000 specimens and representing 
nearly 4,000 species, are on their way 
to Pittsburgh, according to announce­
ment by Director W. J. Holland, di­
rector of the museum.
One of the collection arrived in New 
York several flays ago and is expected 
at the museum within a day or two. 
This collection was made at Santarem 
on the Amazon river by S. M. Klages, 
who has been in the employ of the 
museum for four years. The other two 
collections were made in Bolivia and 
are 'on route to this country.
The collection of birds of the West­
ern Hemisphere in the Museum, Dr. 
Holland said, is one of the largest 
in existence, and, following a purpose 
formed about 20 years ago or more, 
the plan of the museum is, so far as 
possible, to get for it a complete rep­
resentation of all the birds of the new 
world from the Arctic to the Antarct­
ic regions. This plan has been so 
successfully prosecuted that it is pos­
sible to say that almost all species 
found in North America, with few ex­
ceptions, are represented in the mu­
seum and not far from half of those 
known from South America have al­
ready been obtained.
Dr. II. C. Oberholser, the ornitholo­
gist of the United States biological 
survey, in a recent visit to Pittsburgh 
to study the collection of birds in the 
museum, said to Dr. Holland: “Things 
now have reached the point that in 
order to study the birds of South 
America we recognize the fact that 
we must come to Pittsburgh.”
The museum is constantly lending 
specimens to the United States Na­
tional Museum, the Field Museum of 
Chicago and the American Museum of 
Natural History of New York for the 
purpose of study. There are about 
00,000 birds in the museum, repre­
senting nearly all specimens of the 
Western Hemisphere.

COLLEGE PRESIDENT
ADVISES STUDENTS 
(Continued from page 1.)
university is to aid and benefit the 
student. A student who neglects that 
vital business for outside interests, ar­
guing perhaps that these are as bene­
ficial to him as study, is laboring un­
der a great and fatal mistake.
A university is a place of study. The 
student, may, indeed, pursue other ob­
jects, but they must always remain 
subordinate in his main duty and pur­
pose, if he is really to be a student.
Study is his vocation; sports, so­
ciety, the theatre, etc., can never bo 
more than an avocation.
Legitimate and commendable as 
means of innocent recreation and 
amusement, they are to be condemned 
when they distract the students’* n'- 
tention from his proper work, or di­
vert. from it time and energy which 
are needed for the successful accom­
plishment of that work.
As regards athletics a distinc'ioi 
must be made. The tendency in Amer­
ican universities today is everywhere 
to demand too,large a portion of th • 
time of those undergraduates who en­
gage in intercollegiate sports for. prac- 
t ice and training.
The two changes 1 should like to see 
in the field of athletics are these: 
first, a reduction of the time demand­
ed of members of the team and crews; 
and secondly, a more general partici­
pation in sports and. games of all 
kinds by students generally.
It may be that the athletics appeal 
more strongly to fraternity men than 
to other students, but I suspect that 
it. is social distractions which, in the 
main, account for the lower standing 
of fraternity men.
Fraternal houses furnish congenial 
conditions for social life. And social 
intercourse is a great boon in the life 
of young men. Here, as elsewhere, 
the problem is to use our opportuni­
ties and advantages without abusing 
them.
It is for fraternities to show that 
they can furnish the conditions of a 
normal and healthful social life, with­
out interfering with the student’s 
scholastic attainments, or weakening 
his intellectual ambitions and inter­
ests.
Besides athletic and social functions 
the extra-academic activities of stu­
dents run in a variety of smaller chan­
nels, among which may be mentioned 
ungraduate publications, literary, ora­
torical and dramatic performances, 
political and ethical reform, the or­
ganized work of the Cornell Univer­
sity Christian Association, etc.
These all commend themselves in a 
measure by their intellectual, moral, 
or religious character.
But to all of them I apply the same 
criterion which I have laid down in 
regard to social and atheltic activities.
The university being a place of 
study, a student has no right to neg­
lect his studies even for ethical and 
religious work or edification, and 
much less to gratify an histronic am­
bition, or to win the so-called “honor" 
of election to the editorial or manag­
ing board of some undergraduate pub­
lication.
The chief end of the student is to 
study. So long as he is privileged to 
remain in the university, so long as 
these precious years of preparation 
for life are vouchsafed to him, his 
supreme duty is to study hard.
In man there is nothing great but 
mind. Colleges and universities exist 
for the training and development of 
the mind.
Let students never forget that every
PAGE PÛUR
thing else in their student lives are 
subordinate to that transcendent ob­
ject. There are indeed ancillary ac­
tivities ,but essentially considered, 
student activities are studious activ­
ities.

next logical step. Moreover, what­
ever concessions the administration 
may make, they will be useless unless 
generous and substantial to all.”
Such moves as the founding of a 
colony for the faculty and their fam­
ilies, as announced in The Dispatch 
yesterday, meets with the approval of 
the teachers, it is said, but it is felt 
that while such things may help to 
fight the cost of living, increases that 
will place the salaries of members of 
the faculty nearly on a par with sal­
aries paid at similar schools and col­
leges should be granted.
It is stated that the Tech faculty is 
the lowest paid of any large school in 
the East, and that to place the salar­
ies on a level with those paid at Yale, 
for instance, would mean an increase 
of about 00 per cent.
Salaries at Tech.
Salaries paid Tech teachers are 
about as follows: Assistants and in­
structors, $100 to $150 a month; as­
sistant and associate professors, .$150 
to .$200; proefessors and heads of de­
partments, .$200 to .$250 a month, it is 
declared. Th efigures are only ap­
proximate because of the fact that 
salary lists are never made known by 
the trustees.
“The most promising scheme, which 
undoubtedly will be adopted at the 
next faculty meeting, is one in which 
the demand will be made for an im­
mediate raise of at least 25 per cent 
all around. This would make it pos­
sible for the administration to satisfy 
both senior and new members of the 
faculty. It may be that the request to 
make the raise retroactive to October 
1 will be made,” a teach said.-----------V-----------

A Gateway—Electrical
ONLY a forty-foot gateway bounded by 
two brick pilasters and ornamental 
lamps, but unlike any other gateway in the 
entire world.
For back of it is the General Electric Com­
pany’s main office building, accommodating 
2300 employees. And just next door is its 
laboratory with the best equipment for test­
ing, standardizing and research at the com­
mand of capable engineers. Then down the 
street—a mile long—are other buildings 
where everything electrical, from the small­
est lamp socket to the huge turbines for 
electrically propelled battleships, is made
by the 20,000 electrical workers who daily 
stream through.
What a story this gate would tell, if it could, 
of the leaders of the electrical industry and 
business, of ambassadors from other insti­
tutions and from foreign lands.
The story would be the history of electric 
lighting, electric transportation, electric in­
dustrials and electricity in the home.
This gateway, as well as the research, en­
gineering, manufacturing and commercial 
resources back of it, is open to all who are 
working for the betterment of the electrical 
industry.
