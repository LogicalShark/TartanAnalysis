In light of spirituality 
development month here 
at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, the State of the Uni-
versity held a discussion 
on interfaith and reason in 
today’s society. This event 
occurred Thursday, Nov, 
17 at 4:30 p.m. in Doherty 
Hall A302. Five student 
speakers began the discus-
sion, but audience mem-
bers and a variety of other 
student speakers joined the 
conversation as the event 
progressed.
The event began with a 
discussion about the crucial 
question of how religion at 
college is different than 
back home. Many speak-
ers claimed that college is 
about de?ning your own 
religion and deciding what 
you truly want to believe 
in without the guidance of 
your family. There are no 
longer strict parameters or 
regiments like those that 
surrounded you as you 
grew up, but rather an op-
portunity to de?ne our own 
religious identity.
David White, a 
sophomore statistics major 
and member of the Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellow-
ship, noted that college is 
a lonely place where we’re 
among our own solitude. 
Back home, we’re provid-
ed with support from our 
friends and family mem-
bers who we have grown 
up with and who can pro-
vide us with emotional 
stability. He believes that 
at Carnegie Mellon, we’re 
sometimes relieved to ?nd 
comfort in our religion or 
faith, knowing that there 
is someone there, someone

During the past two 
weeks, housing servic-
es has proposed several 
changes for Greek Hous-
ing’s 2017–2018 lease. Tom 
Cooley, director of Housing 
Services at Carnegie Mel-
lon presented these propos-
als at two forums to gauge 
reactions from the Greek 
organizations to these new 
changes. The Tartan inter-
viewed Cooley to get more 
information on what led to 
many of these changes.
One major change made 
in this new lease deals with 
the current ?nancial sign 
over form for Greek hous-
ing. The ?nancial sign over 
form is a document that 
students who join Greek or-
ganizations must sign in or-
der for the organization to 
charge them for fees. Under 
the current system, Greek 
organizations have the op-
tion to bill students for 
any kind of Greek-related 
fees through this sign over 
form, which allows Greek 
organizations to withdraw 
money from individual stu-
dents’ university accounts. 
All but one of the Greek 
organizations on campus 
currently use the sign over 
form to charge students for 
chapter dues.
While this system 
guarantees that the Greek 
organizations will always 
receive the money they 
charge, it also puts extra 
responsibility on Housing 
Services to keep track of 
the money. “We are man-
aging being an accountant 
for their fees,” Cooley re-
marked, “and there’s a lot of 
risks from the university’s 
standpoint.” The new lease

The Roosevelt Institute 
released a report last year 
that revealed that Carn-
egie Mellon has lost $44.75 
million since 2004 on five 
variable-to-fixed rate swap 
agreements and is expected 
to lose $44 million more on 
these deals.
Carnegie Mellon uses a 
swap to hedge against vari-
able interest rates. For exam-
ple, Carnegie Mellon issued 
a bond in 2006 (essentially 
taking on a loan) in order 
to finance new construction 
and pay off existing debts. 
Since interest rates in the 
market often change, Carn-
egie Mellon made an agree-
ment with PNC Financial 
Services to pay a $100 mil-
lion fixed interest rate every 
month until 2028. PNC, in 
turn, would pay Carnegie 
Mellon the variable interest 
rate based on the constantly 
fluctuating LIBOR rate.
“The university took this 
action to reduce its exposure 
to rising interest rates on 
variable rate debt,” Ken Wal-
ters, Executive Director of 
Media Relations said. “The 
agreements eliminated the

Three years ago, human 
rights monitors discovered 
that there were pervasive hu-
man rights abuses of laborers 
in Qatar working on construc-
tion projects related to the 
2022 World Cup, which is to 
be hosted in the Middle East-
ern country. Many of these la-
borers are migrants from other 
countries, many in South Asia.
The laborers are “treated 
like cattle” according to Am-
nesty International. The Inter-
national Trade Union Confed-
eration estimates that at least 
4,000 migrant workers would 
die due to work-related inci-
dents before the World Cup 
even starts. Amnesty Interna-
tional also found that workers 
may also not be getting paid on 
time, are forced to live in dirty 
and cramped conditions, have 
their passports con?scated 
by employers, are threatened 
for complaining about harsh 
working conditions, and have 
to pay high fees which reach 
into thousands of U.S. dollars 
to recruiters in exchange for a 
Qatari job.
Unfortunately, despite 
Qatar’s announcements of la-
bor reforms two years ago, the 
abuses have continued into 
this year at various World Cup 
sites in Doha.
Because of the severity 
of this problem, Amnesty 
International at Cornell Uni-
versity, its sister organization 
at Carnegie Mellon University, 
and student groups from seven 
other universities in the U.S., 
Canada, and U.K., are deliv-
ering an open letter to each 
of their respective university 
presidents asking them to uti-
lize the universities’ existing 
connections to Qatar satel-
lite campuses to put pressure 
on Qatari authorities to put 
a binding labor reform plan 
into place before construction 
peaks in 2017.
All of the universities 
involved have satellite campus-
es in the Education City district 
of Doha, which is physically 
very close to where many of the 
labor abuses are taking place. 
In particular, the letter asks 
the university presidents to de-
mand the labor reforms via the 
President’s Council, a forum 
among international universi-
ties in Qatar that is convened 
by Her Highness Sheikha Moza 
bint Nasser, a Qatari royal and 
high-pro?le surrogate for the 
Qatari government. Because 
the presidents of the universi-
ties serve on the council, they 
can potentially have consider-
able access and in?uence over 
people at the highest levels of 
the Qatari government.
The efforts of this petition 
were led by the Cornell chapter 
of Amnesty International. 
Christopher Hanna of Cornell 
University, the facilitator of 
the campaign, said he was 
encouraged to pursue this 
since Cornell’s former acting 
president had previously ex-
pressed a willingness to use the 
power of the President’s Coun-
cil to pressure the Qatari gov-
ernment to respect the rights 
of political prisoners.
“The values that our 
universities claim to uphold ... 
everything from human rights 
to [equal] opportunity...aren’t 
being respected in Qatar,” Han-
na said in an interview with 
The Tartan. Our universities 
have partnered with Qatar to 
establish cutting-edge academ-
ic programs in Education City, 
but they haven’t quite yet part-
nered up in promoting human 
rights and the rule of law.
He started this campaign 
over the summer and played 
a signi?cant role in plan-
ning the cross-campus cam-
paign and drafting the open 
letter. The letter contains a 
blueprint appended from 
Amnesty International’s re-
port of speci?c labor reforms 
and includes reparations for 
workers who were victims 
of labor violations at Khalifa 
International Stadium.
One of the groups that was 
contacted for support in this 
campaign is Amnesty Interna-
tional at Carnegie Mellon, led 
by co-presidents Sam Bolig, 
a sophomore statistics major, 
and Jack Verser, a junior social 
and decision science major. 
“As students of Carnegie 
Mellon, we felt compelled to 
offer our support by present-
ing this open letter to our 
University President and the 
Dean of our campus in Qatar,” 
Bolig and Verser said in an 
interview with The Tartan.
Their hope is that 
President Suresh and the Ilker 
Baybours, Dean of the Qatari 
campus, will help raise aware-
ness of the issue and present 
a united front against these 
abuses before World Cup 
construction peaks next year. 
“Ideally, these actions would 
create a movement toward 
reforming these horri?c labor 
practices at the World Cup 
construction sites that would 
reach the Qatari government,” 
said the co-presidents.

CMU Professor Kanade receives 2016 Kyoto Prize for Advanced TechnologyCarnegie Mellon University will host its fourth annual Giving Tuesday on Nov. 29
On Tuesday, Nov. 29, 
after students return from 
Thanksgiving break, Carn-
egie Mellon will be hosting 
its fourth annual Giving 
Tuesday, an event open to 
the entire Carnegie Mellon 
community in the U.S. or 
abroad. The 24-hour event is 
focused on both philanthro-
py and volunteering. This 
year, Carnegie Mellon hopes 
to raise $1,600 in donations. 
This would be a 22 percent 
increase from last year’s 
Giving Tuesday.
On Tuesday, all gifts 
that are made online, on 
the phone, or in person will 
count towards the event. 
Any direct mail gifts post-
marked before 11:59 p.m. on 
Nov. 29 can also be counted 
based on the donor’s intent.
Each college will conduct 
events throughout the day 
in Wean Commons in the 
Cohon Center. There will be 
a midnight “Plaid-Palooza” 
until 1 a.m. that will provide 
students with food and en-
tertainment as well as phil-
anthropic education. Social 
media challenges will be re-
leased throughout the day. 
Winners of these challenges 
will be able to randomly 
select a fund which they 
would like to see receive a 
$500 gift.
A group of students will 
also be selected to partici-
pate in unique opportunities 
such as having lunch with 
Carnegie Mellon President 
Subra Suresh or touring the 
steam tunnels with the Dean 
of Student Affairs.
The student organization 
that makes the most 
donations over $5 will 
receive a $500 gift.

DOMINIQUE ESCANDON
Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabinet 
Writer of The Student 
Government. 
Something that’s always 
been important to the Stu-
dent Government President’s 
Cabinet has been ensuring 
the comfort of every student 
on campus. In our meeting 
immediately following the 
election results, we re?ected 
on this past year’s tumultu-
ous election. We felt it was 
necessary to help provide 
a nonpartisan space where 
students could ?nd support 
in each other, faculty, or 
staff and have productive 
conversations about how the 
election affected them over 
a slice of pizza. We reserved 
a space in Danforth, created 
the Facebook page to adver-
tise this “Pizza and Conver-
sation” event, and waited for 
Nov. 14 to come.
Immediately, I became 
nervous. How would the 
night go? The calls I received 
while the election results 
came pouring in were so 
emotional. Was I prepared to 
revisit that?
Of course, Carnegie 
Mellon’s response amazed 
me. Beyond all else, it was 
incredibly comforting to 
hear from faculty members 
who had experienced simi-
lar elections and told us we 
would be able to live to tell 
the tale, and I’m so grateful 
that they were so willing to 
offer us their time to share 
this experience with us. And 
of course, the discussions 
I had throughout the night 
were rational, analytical, 
incredibly re?ective, and 
always hopeful.
Misinformation had a 
major in?uence over this 
election. What news sources 
do people use to get un-
biased reporting? Should 
politicians align their public 
views with that of their 
parties to represent them 
better, or would we rather 
they stick to their personal 
values to show strength of 
character? What were “Not 
My President” protests hop-
ing to accomplish? When 
are Facebook comments a 
good space for conversa-
tion, and what makes social 
media effective for creat-
ing discussion? By the time 
I had to leave to go back to 
my mousetrap car, I felt like 
I had a better understanding 
of how to have productive 
political conversations, es-
pecially with people I hadn’t 
met before, and I hope ev-
eryone else felt as satis?ed 
with their experience as I 
did with mine.
However, I recognize 
participation in this event 
alone doesn’t constitute 
me as an “excellent citizen” 
whose civic duties of en-
gagement, compassion, and 
inclusion are all ful?lled. 
There are so many intelli-
gent and valued students on 
campus who didn’t attend 
this event because they were 
still struggling with the emo-
tions they might be feeling, 
or felt like their thoughts 
wouldn’t be welcomed on 
such a liberal campus. We 
should all consider how we 
can offer support to every-
one who has felt forgotten 
in this election, be it in its 
results or in its reactions. 
Regardless of your political 
leaning, you deserve respect 
and love. Choosing compas-
sion can be hard but makes a 
better campus for us all.
If you’re feeling scared 
about your permanence 
in the United States or the 
health of the industry you’re 
hoping to progress to af-
ter graduation, know that 
there are always faculty and 
staff members willing to lis-
ten and give advice. Don’t 
know where to start? You 
can always reach out to any 
member of the President’s 
Cabinet!
On Nov. 10, Takeo 
Kanade, the UA and Helen 
Whitaker University Profes-
sor of Robotics and Com-
puter Science at Carnegie 
Mellon University, received 
the 2016 Kyoto Prize for 
Advanced Technology. The 
ceremony took place in 
Kyoto, Japan.
The Kyoto Prize for 
Advanced Technology is giv-
en to people who have who 
have made signi?cant scien-
ti?c, cultural and spiritual 
contributions to help hu-
mankind. Kanade received 
his prize for his contribu-
tions to computer visions and 
robotics. The prize comes 
with a gold medal and a 
cash award of 50 million yen 
(approximately $450,000).
Kanade became part of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics 
Institute and the Computer 
Science Department in 1980. 
He was the director of the 
Robotics Institute from 1992 
to 2001.
Kanade is responsible for 
fundamental discoveries in 
face detection technology, 
automated driving, three-di-
mensional image reconstruc-
tion, self-?ying helicopters, 
and the use of video images 
to estimate the direction and 
speed of moving objects. In 
his early years at Carnegie 
Mellon, Kanade founded and 
led NavLab, which worked 
on a vision-based autono-
mous car. Kanade also co-de-
veloped the world’s ?rst di-
rect-drive robot arm, which 
is now recognized as one 
of the most advanced robot 
arm technologies.
On Nov. 16, students took part in a walk-out to show unity for people who are vulnerable under Donald Trump’s presidency including undocumented immigrants, Muslims, LGBTQ people, black people, and all people of color.

speci?es that only rent and 
rent-based parlor fees from 
non-residential members of 
the Greek organizations will 
be collected through Hous-
ing Services and billed from 
student account; it requires 
all Greek organizations to bill 
chapter fees independently, 
possibly through a third-party 
transaction.
In order to help the 
fraternities and sororities 
adapt to this change, Housing 
Services will “[have] more in-
tentional conversations with 
these organizations about how 
to make this change, and work 
with organizations on making 
this shift,” Cooley said.
The largest controversy 
among Greek communities 
has to do with the topic of 
receiving refunds when stu-
dents change their residence. 
In situations where a mem-
ber of a Greek organization 
decides to move out of their 
chapter housing, the current 
lease gives individual chapters 
the freedom to choose how 
much the individual will be 
charged throughout the rest 
of the leasing period when the 
student is no longer living in 
the house.
Initially, Housing Services 
proposed to change this policy 
because it is inconsistent with 
other on campus housing poli-
cies. Students who move out 
of other on-campus residences 
for approved reasons, unlike 
those in Greek housing, re-
ceive a refund from the uni-
versity, while Greek residents 
are not guaranteed a refund 
when they withdraw. The 
current practice allows Greek 
organizations to manage and 
prevent extra ?nancial burden 
due to losing residents. Re-
quiring Greek organizations to 
refund individuals could lead 
to an increase in the amount 
every individual has to pay.
After negotiating and 
communicating with repre-
sentatives from Greek life or-
ganizations, Housing Services 
agreed not to change this cur-
rent practice. “We decided 
to keep the status quo,” said 
Cooley, “the house manager 
or the treasurer has the abil-
ity to decide whether they 
would refund or not refund 
the students.”
Rules regarding boarders 
in Greek housing were re-
stated and emphasized in 
the new contract. Boarders, 
the non-Greek members who 
reside in Greek houses, will no 
longer be allowed due to laws 
regarding subletting and their 
lack of housing insurance. 
In the past, Greek organiza-
tions have allowed boarders to 
sublet at chapter houses dur-
ing the summer to generate 
revenues for their chapters.
Housing Services now also 
has the right to close a Greek 
house over the summer for 
renovations or cleaning with 
prior notice, given that Greek 
houses generally do not reach 
the minimum standard of 
cleanliness.
The overall rate increase 
of all Greek Quad housings 
will be 5.5 percent, which is 
lower than this rate has been 
in the past three years. The 
rent at Margaret Morrison 
Greek houses will decrease by 
15 percent to normalize the 
existing inequity in rent.
All changes for the new 
lease are ?nal and complete 
with the exception of a few 
details regarding housing 
insurance, which the univer-
sity legal team is still in the 
process of drafting. The new 
lease will be complete by next 
week, and will be presented 
to all Greek organizations 
on campus to sign. The new 
lease will become effective on 
July 1, 2017.
Housing Services clari?es new changes to Greek housing lease

Housing Services has recently proposed multiple changes to the lease for Carnegie Mellon University’s Greek housing. Housing Services can now close Greek houses over the summer and has disallowed boarders from residing there.  
in the bigger picture, who is 
guiding us through times of 
adversity and frustration.
Many students mentioned 
that since Carnegie Mellon is 
an intensely academic school, 
we may tend to ?nd ourselves 
at a crossroads between 
religion and education.
A physics major in the 
audience supported this 
view, noting that while he 
was studying Higgs Boson, a 
fundamental ?eld to the ?rst 
particle physics theory, he was 
forced to rethink the existence 
of God. If there are solidi?ed 
facts that the existence of 
Earth was created through sci-
enti?c realms, where does the 
idea that God molded earth 
and humans come into play?
Meanwhile, another 
audience member suggested 
that religion and science co-
exist. They claimed that with-
out religion and ethics, biol-
ogy itself is incomplete. As the 
world is changing and we seek 
to understand our lives and 
the past, religion serves as a 
supplement and anchor. Both 
science and religion are seek-
ing to understand the universe 
and collaborate to explain 
what the other cannot.
The open conversation 
touched upon what exactly 
religion is. In our lives, we 
seek to live by standards, to 
follow regiments, and make 
ourselves accountable. The 
panelists claim that religion 
is a system of accountability. 
No matter what it may be — 
Christianity, Buddhism, Jain-
ism, Hinduism, Islam, etc. 
— the ultimate purpose of 
religion is to better human-
ity. They also claimed that, 
as human beings, we are not 
objective, and that as humans 
attempt to create this baseline 
set of standards, we often feel 
in touch with religion, where 
our morals and senses align.
The discussion also focused 
on religion as it connects spe-
ci?cally to Carnegie Mellon. 
Many questions were raised, 
such as: How is Carnegie Mel-
lon as a university in terms 
of religion? Is it secular? Is it 
welcoming to accepting a va-
riety of faiths? What is faith 
itself?
“At Carnegie Mellon, you 
don’t just simply choose to 
believe” said Andy Norman, 
an adjunct faculty member in 
the Department of Philoso-
phy and director of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Humanism Initia-
tive. He believes that there is 
a disconnect between skepti-
cism, rationality, and faith. 
When is faith used to defend 
certain things? What is the 
distinct line between religion 
and faith?
The conversation moved 
towards the suggestion that 
faith and religion are an 
application to self. Faith is 
not necessarily tied to a reli-
gion. As religion provides us 
with parameters and a way of 
life, faith is what we decide to 
believe in. While you may be-
lieve that Jesus died and rose, 
providing that it is written in 
our history, to believe that his 
death and resurrection was 
a payment for our sins, takes 
faith. According to Reverend 
Eric Andrae of the First Trinity 
Lutheran Church, our univer-
sity is not secular in that God 
touches upon every aspect of 
life. While Carnegie Mellon is 
not bound by religious af?li-
ation, he believes that we are 
still blessed by God.
To further the discussion 
on Interfaith, the Jewish Stu-
dent Association, Muslim Stu-
dent Association, and Inter-
Varsity Fellowship hosted the 
Carnegie Mellon Interfaith 
Thanksgiving Table on Sun-
day to bring together students 
of different spirituality back-
grounds to connect through 
faith, values, and food. Also, 
in an attempt to promote a 
welcoming environment on 
the discussion of religion, 
Carnegie Mellon is hosting 
Ask Me Anything (AMA) Day, 
where individuals across cam-
pus will wear buttons to en-
courage others to ask them 
about spirituality, faith, and 
religion.
State of the University allows students to hold dialogue on faith
risk of the university being 
exposed to higher variable 
interest rates by changing the 
debt to a less risky, ?xed rate.”
After the Great Recession 
of 2007 and 2008, however, 
central banks like the Federal 
Reserve lowered interest rates 
to zero and some to sub-zero. 
This meant that the bank was 
paying an almost-zero rate to 
Carnegie Mellon while Carn-
egie Mellon was still paying 
the ?xed rate based on the 
market in 2006. This created 
a discrepancy between what 
Carnegie Mellon was paying 
PNC and what it was receiv-
ing from the bank, leading 
the school to lose $24 million 
in this particular agreement 
and $44.75 million through 
the ?ve total payments so far.
The university is expected 
to lose more money on these 
swaps since interest rates 
remain at levels far below 
those in 2006. While the Roo-
sevelt Institute report says 
that Carnegie Mellon has 
paid $39.15 million and is 
expected to pay $34 million 
more, the latest annual 
?nancial report released last 
week shows that Carnegie 
Mellon has so far paid $44.75 
million and its forecasted ac-
tual loss will be an additional 
$44.175 million, for a total 
loss of $88.925 million. Carn-
egie Mellon cannot terminate 
these contracts without pay-
ing the fair value, or expected 
value of the deal, which is 
effectively the loss the agree-
ments will garner, nullifying 
any bene?t of canceling the 
agreement.
Carnegie Mellon spent 
$5.6 million on paying the 
swap interest this past year 
and since the highest-value 
swap agreement doesn’t 
end until 2028, most of 
this payment is going to be 
consistently present until 
then.
Considering, however, 
that Carnegie Mellon’s total 
operating and non-operating 
expenses were $1.09 billion, 
this loss only accounts for 0.5 
percent of the university’s an-
nual expenses, indicating that 
it hasn’t created a substantial 
loss to the university.
At the same time, the loss 
Carnegie Mellon has realized 
so far in swap agreements 
could pay the tuition and fees 
of 855 undergraduate stu-
dents in 2016, or 13 percent 
of the undergraduate class. It 
must be noted, however, that 
this loss has occurred over 
12 years rather than a single 
year.
For the future, Carnegie 
Mellon already agreed in 
2007 to four swap agreements 
worth a total of $80.425 mil-
lion that will go into effect 
from 2028 to 2031. This of-
fers the university stability for 
however the market looks like 
at the time, but locks it into a 
contract into the future.
One bene?t to the swap 
agreement has been that 
Carnegie Mellon now knows 
the rate it must pay each year 
for the life of the agreements. 
While protecting against ris-
ing interest rates, though, this 
exposed to Carnegie Mellon 
to a loss in income induced by 
lower rates. Thus, the univer-
sity is now paying more than 
it otherwise would be without 
a swap agreement.
In addition to Carnegie 
Mellon, the report also stud-
ied losses generated by 18 
other universities on similar 
swap agreements. The phe-
nomenon is not unique to 
Carnegie Mellon, as Harvard, 
for example, has lost $1.25 
billion and the University 
of Michigan has lost $85.5 
million. In total, the 19 in-
stitutions have paid $2.7 bil-
lion on swap agreements they 
signed, some starting over a 
decade ago. According to the 
Roosevelt Institute, the mon-
ey lost on these swaps could 
have paid the tuition and fees 
of 108,000 undergraduate 
students for one year at the 
19 institutions.
In general, having low 
interest rates should help an 
university that issued bonds 
to ?nance construction or 
other investments since it 
could now re?nance its debt 
and pay a lower interest rate 
in the future. However, the 
swap agreements’ termina-
tion penalties often make it 
dif?cult for colleges to exit 
the agreement.
These penalties also rose 
when the interest rates fell 
since they are based on the 
net expected value Carnegie 
Mellon will gain from these 
deals, which became fur-
ther negative when the rates 
declined.
One action the report 
recommended schools with 
bad swap deals take is to ask 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to investigate 
whether banks did not prop-
erly explain the risks of the 
swap agreements. According 
to the report, they are legally 
required to do so, but banks 
often “downplay the risks 
and highlighted the savings 
that borrowers would enjoy 
if none of the risks associated 
with these highly risky deals 
materialized.”
Another action the report 
recommended to universi-
ties was to look into suing the 
bank based on whether it ma-
nipulated the LIBOR rate. The 
LIBOR rate is an interest rate 
set by the most prominent 
global banks in the world 
and is the one which ?nan-
cial institutions’ payments to 
Carnegie Mellon are based 
on. Many of the banks, in-
cluding JPMorgan Chase, il-
legally colluded to keep this 
rate low from 2007 to 2010, 
potentially increasing the 
losses Carnegie Mellon and 
other institutions generated 
from the swap agreements.
Raaga Kalva, co-president 
of the Roosevelt Institute’s 
Carnegie Mellon Chapter, cit-
ed increases in tuition and the 
lack of adequate ?nancial aid 
offered by Carnegie Mellon 
as being problematic for stu-
dents. He believes the money 
that was lost could have been 
“used for the students and for 
the faculty and for our insti-
tution versus going to these 
banks.”
The Roosevelt Institute 
cites the spread of swap 
agreements as a sign of the in-
creasing in?uence of ?nancial 
?rms.
Kalva backs the sentiment, 
saying, “the lack of our ?-
nancial expertise should not 
be something that becomes 
a factor in the way that stu-
dents’ lives are affected be-
cause that’s not the goal of 
our institution.”

Allegheny detention center violates basic human rightsStereotyping other side 
damages, divides U.S.
SARAH BENDER
With Donald Trump’s election to 
the of?ce of President of the United 
States, the divide among the Ameri-
can people has widened: there are 
the bleeding-heart liberals who 
champion the fundamental rights 
of all humans and think every small 
slight is a cause for immediate out-
rage and offense, and the sel?sh 
conservatives who are either too 
concerned with their own interests 
to worry about the people suddenly 
vulnerable in Trump’s America, or 
who are secretly racist, sexist, xe-
nophobic and homophobic them-
selves, and therefore vindicated in 
their prejudices by the outcome. 
At least these are the reductive and 
harmful generalizations we’ve been 
left with in the midst of the current 
political turmoil.
Things really aren’t looking 
great for anybody at the moment. 
Those who had ample reason to vote 
against Trump — those who aren’t 
straight, white, male, or Christian, 
for example — could be in imminent 
danger of losing rights that they’ve 
fought so hard to gain, in a country 
where equality is unfortunately far 
more selective than we tend to feel 
comfortable admitting. At the same 
time, the white working class and 
others who supported Trump have 
been crying out about failing eco-
nomic systems and an unsustain-
able way of life for many elections 
now, only to be repeatedly ignored 
by career politicians who couldn’t 
care less about their situation — 
and Trump’s campaign promises 
about the economy just don’t add 
up. But while both sides have very 
legitimate concerns, they have also 
become increasingly hostile due to a 
cycle of vicious insults supplement-
ed with little actual dialogue. The 
fact that we remain unwilling to lis-
ten to others means that our country 
may be harder to heal than anyone 
wants to imagine, both conserva-
tives and liberals alike will have to 
become more open minded in order 
to bridge the gap between their vast-
ly different viewpoints.
A good ?rst step in trying to 
change this ideological stalemate 
would be for those who supported 
Trump — or even those who didn’t, 
but don’t see his looming presidency 
as any particular cause for alarm — 
to stop looking down on those who 
are protesting and petitioning to 
protect their rights from an almost 
inevitable attack. This isn’t liberals 
being sore losers and harboring re-
sentment. This is people standing 
up for their fellow human beings, 
making sure the incoming adminis-
tration knows that their well-docu-
mented hatred will not be accepted 
willingly by the people.
Sure, maybe Trump’s position 
on the LGBTQ community has ?uc-
tuated even in the short time since 
the election, and he might not seek 
to reverse marriage equality. Maybe 
Trump didn’t actually want the en-
dorsement of the KKK — in fact, his 
campaign did denounce the group’s 
support just days before the election. 
But that doesn’t change the fact that 
hateful, intolerant people evidently 
feel that their vision for our country 
will be easier to attain in Trump’s 
America, and this is both a serious 
problem for our society and a very 
real reason for people to feel afraid.
The truth is, if we don’t see some-
one’s fears as valid during this time, 
it probably re?ects more on us and 
our privilege than on their tendency 
to overreact. 
The next time you feel the urge 
to convince someone our country 
has survived bad presidents before, 
take a moment to consider the 4,000 
Cherokee  people who died during 
Andrew Jackson’s presidency, or 
the thousands of Americans who 
succumbed to AIDS before Ronald 
Reagan ever addressed the disease 
as a concern. Think about the Japa-
nese internment camps that held 
approximately 120,000 people — 
many of whom were American citi-
zens — prisoner during World War 
II. Sure, this nation has weathered 
bad presidential decisions before, 
but certain individual groups have 
not been so lucky.
We can’t even honestly claim that 
American society today is drastically 
different and therefore undeniably 
safer than it was in the past. Just 
last year, Vice President-elect Mike 
Pence ignored an HIV epidemic in 
Indiana for more than two months, 
even as people were infected at a rate 
of more than 20 per day. Trump’s 
Let’s assume you respect wom-
en, believe in racial equality, value 
democracy, and care about honesty, 
decency, and basic human kind-
ness. How can you ?ght for those 
beliefs and values? Since the elec-
tion, I have talked with many stu-
dents who are grappling with that 
most important of questions — 
what can I do now to make things 
better?
Students have changed the world 
many times. On Feb. 1, 1960 four 
African American college freshmen 
sat down at a “whites only” lunch 
counter in Greensboro, North Caro-
lina. They were refused service but 
they did not leave. The next day, 
there were 20 students “sitting-in” 
at that lunch counter. By the end of 
the month, thousands of students 
and supporters had launched sit-
ins, swim-ins, and other protests 
throughout much of America.
It is happening again. Students 
are again rising to the challenge 
of building a more just world. You 
won’t all agree on what that world 
should look like, but your disagree-
ments can be a source of strength 
so long as you can respect your 
differences and learn from them. 
Over the last week, I have been pro-
foundly inspired by my students, 
not just because so many are ?ght-
ing for their beliefs, but because 
they are doing so while listening to 
those who see things differently.
So what should you do now? 
There are many ways to create 
positive social change, and I do not 
believe Carnegie Mellon students 
need a professor to tell them what 
to do. Just don’t stop believing in 
your power.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: THE 
POWER OF CMU STUDENTS
See DIVISION, A5
It’s been nearly two weeks since 
the election, and President-elect 
Donald Trump has taken to Twit-
ter more than once to show his dis-
pleasure with criticism against him, 
denouncing The New York Times, 
protesters in New York that he called 
“very unfair,” and the cast and crowd 
of Hamilton, from whom he de-
manded an apology. These actions 
continue the unsettling precedent 
set during Trump’s campaign for 
what kind of relationship dissenters 
from the press and the population 
can expect with President Trump.
No matter who you voted for, 
we the people must now ?ght to 
uphold a fundamental American 
freedom — the freedom of speech. 
What makes America truly great is 
that our democracy promises us the 
right to stand up to our elected of-
?cials if we take issue with their ac-
tions, as well as the right to publicly 
proclaim these opinions in newspa-
pers, on the radio, on television, in 
magazines, etc. — all without fear of 
persecution and censorship. Trump’s 
actions suggest that he would prefer 
a silent, compliant public and press, 
and may be willing to infringe on our 
right to free speech to obtain it. This 
would erode the very foundations of 
our  democracy. 
The best way to protect our rights 
is to exercise them, but to do so ethi-
cally. The ?rst tenet of the Society 
of Professional Journalists’ Code of 
Ethics is to “seek truth and report 
it,” which encompasses a journal-
ist’s duty to provide a complete 
story with all perspectives, to never 
purposefully distort information, to 
hold power structures accountable, 
and to “support the open and civil 
exchange of views, even views they 
?nd repugnant.” Throughout this 
year’s campaign, the media has not 
always upheld their end of this bar-
gain, often spinning stories to create 
favorable angles and silencing view-
points that do not align with their 
story. American media consumption 
habits, supported by the media being 
consumed, have created a climate 
that values audience satisfaction 
and catchy headlines over ethical, 
unbiased reporting that honors all 
perspectives.
In the wake of this election cycle 
and in the face of Trump’s presidency, 
The Tartan will continue to strive to 
uphold our duty, and we hope to see 
the same from other news sources.
At Carnegie Mellon, we want 
to be clear that The Tartan is more 
dedicated than ever to protecting the 
open exchange of information. We 
seek to accurately and completely 
cover campus and national news as 
it pertains to you, our readers. As 
Carnegie Mellon students ourselves, 
we promise to continue looking criti-
cally at everything around us, asking 
dif?cult questions, and endeavoring 
to ?nd their answers. The Tartan is 
a resource for everyone at Carnegie 
Mellon to express their opinions or 
frustrations, generate important 
conversations, and demand action 
from your community. We stand be-
hind the freedoms guaranteed to ev-
eryone by the First Amendment. As 
the Carnegie Mellon student news-
paper, we’re invested in your right to 
exercise those freedoms.

In early November, The Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette reported that the 
Pennsylvania Department of Human 
Services (DHS) was investigating 
Shuman Juvenile Detention Center 
after a possible suicide attempt at 
the detention center. On Sept. 30, 
the Department issued Shuman a 
second provisional license (reduced 
from full license), meaning it has 
not been in compliance with govern-
ment standards for the second time 
and must create a plan to return to 
compliance. Only after a facility’s 
fourth consecutive provisional li-
cense can it be forced to shut down. 
However, the staggering degree of 
the actions that Shuman employees 
have committed against the facility’s 
juvenile residents bring into ques-
tion whether this provisional license 
is an effective consequence.
There have been a variety of inci-
dents over the past several years that 
illustrate the situation at Shuman. 
In April 2013, a worker slammed a 
16-year-old into a door frame. This 
March, an employee grabbed and 
threw a resident to the ?oor by his 
neck, then proceeded to drag him 
along the ?oor by the neck. In April, 
a worker head-butted a resident 
against a wall and left him alone in 
his cell, unconscious, for eight min-
utes until a nurse arrived. And in 
May, two workers escalated a dis-
pute over a bin into an attack that 
culminated in the near-severing of 
a resident’s ear. The injury needed 
30 stitches, according to the DHS re-
port, and was a “signi?cant” factor in 
the second provisional license.
Even worse, is that, according to 
the Post-Gazette’s coverage, the aver-
age stay for residents at Shuman is 
10 to 12 days. And in that short pe-
riod, minors are brutalized.
Even after all of this, the DHS still 
allows Shuman two more attempts 
to solve the issues before they can be 
shut down. This is problematic for 
two reasons.
First, the DHS is placing too much 
responsibility on a facility that has 
already proven unsuccessful. The 
provisional license places the onus 
on the center to formulate a plan to 
right the wrong, when government 
intervention could help to cre-
ate effective plans, and then provide 
the accountability to successfully 
implement them.
But even worse is the precedent 
that the system sets for the rights 
of prisoners as humans and citizens 
of this nation and commonwealth. 
These aren’t hard criminals being at-
tacked and mistreated by employees 
— they’re minors. If these actions oc-
curred anywhere other than a juve-
nile detention center, there would be 
public outcry. The adults responsible 
would be criminally charged. Even 
though prisoners are not afforded 
every constitutional freedom, they 
are still protected by the cruel and 
unusual punishment clause. Their 
safety, health, and decency ought to 
be a legal paramount for any facility 
with human lives in their care.
Shuman’s director Earl Hill attrib-
uted the mistreatments to problems 
with training employees, but more 
important than training alone is the 
act of cultivating a culture and mind-
set that prioritizes residents’ human-
ity over their criminality.

NINA NELLY KOWALEWSKI
Junior Staffwriter
I would love to visit the beautiful 
glacial ?gures nestled in the moun-
tains of Montana’s Glacier National 
Park someday — that is, someday 
very soon. I crossed one of the gla-
ciers before I was born, when my 
adventurous mother went on a hik-
ing expedition to Montana when she 
was pregnant with me. The picture of 
my mother crossing a long lick of ice 
may be “my” only picture in the vicin-
ity of these wonders of nature if I do 
not get a chance to see them for my-
self within the next decade. By 2030, 
these once grand, magni?cent sculp-
tures could become virtually obsolete 
as a result of global warming causing 
our climate to change.
This phenomenon of long term 
climate change has been acknowl-
edged by every single major scienti?c 
agency in the United States, who cite 
the primary culprit for its accelera-
tion as none other than humankind 
itself, a claim that is documented by 
hundreds of studies. Yet an unam-
biguous consensus that the higher 
average global temperatures have 
been increasing — with 15 of the 
16 warmest years on record having 
been recorded since the beginning of 
the 21st century — is not enough to 
convince our President-elect Donald 
Trump that climate change is NOT 
a hoax.
The last time I checked 
(and I do my share of ex-
tensive fact-checking), I 
could not ?nd any creden-
tials that cited Donald 
Trump as a scientist. Re-
ality star? Check. Busi-
ness leader? Check. 
Quali?ed to make an 
educated assessment 
of scienti?c data and 
scienti?c opinions? 
Not even close.
Donald Trump 
has an extensive 
history of calling 
climate change a 
‘hoax’. Somehow I cannot ?nd con-
ceivable evidence to support his tout-
ed claim. I can, however, con?dently 
tell you that if we continue to choose 
to ignore climate change, its effects 
pose a great threat to our planet’s di-
verse life and ecosystems.
In the last century, average global 
temperatures driven by human activ-
ities, have increased by 1.5 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Naturally, the planet has 
periods of cooling and warming, but 
as our civilization has rapidly ad-
vanced in the past 200 years, it has 
not done so without leaving a foot-
print on the environment. Our indus-
trial impact is largely responsible for 
the rising levels of greenhouse gases, 
including carbon dioxide and meth-
ane, that are released through the 
combustion of fossil fuels for electric-
ity, transportation, and heat.
Typically when we a picture a gas, 
we think of it as disappearing and 
dissipating away because we can-
not see it anymore. However, as is 
the case with a ma-
jority of green-
house gases, 
some may 
actually persist in the atmosphere 
in a layer around our earth for any-
where between 10 to 100 years. As 
greenhouse gases build up in the at-
mosphere, they exhibit a warming 
effect on the earth by trapping the 
heat, resulting in the greenhouse ef-
fect. During the day, sunlight warms 
the earth. Heat collected by the earth 
during the day escapes in the form 
of infrared radiation. Normally, it 
would continue to escape directly 
into space. Instead, it is stopped by 
greenhouse gases. Instead of per-
mitting infrared radiation to pass 
through them, these gases absorb it 
and spread it back to the land and the 
ocean. Greenhouse gases are neces-
sary components of our atmosphere, 
shielding us from incoming infrared 
radiation from sunlight that has dam-
aging properties for us and our skin, 
but as emissions from human activi-
ties increase and more greenhouse 
gases build up in the atmosphere, 
they exhibit a gradual detrimental 
effect that is caused by 
this unnatural, 
human-accelerated global warming 
over time.
Rising global temperature is only 
one of many indicators of climate 
change. Total snowfall has exhib-
ited a decrease over the past decades 
with 80 percent of the locations 
studied experiencing more winter 
precipitation in the form of rain in-
stead of snow. With human-induced 
climate change, extreme weather 
events are likely to become more fre-
quent and intense. This past decade 
has seen twice as many record high 
temperatures as record lows. In ad-
dition, despite natural variability, 
there is a clear substantial overall 
increase in sea surface temperature 
since the 1950s.
The rate of increase in sea level 
has recently surpassed that of an 
inch per decade. The ocean water it-
self has become more acidic — this is 
due to the increased carbon dioxide 
levels in the atmosphere that dis-
solve in the water, where they create 
an imbalance in the nutrients in 
the water and can disrupt 
the life and growth 
of marine animals. 
The ice in the Arctic and Antarctic 
ice caps has exhibited a decrease, 
and the rate of melting of glaciers 
has accelerated over the past decade, 
contributing to the rise in sea level. 
The oceanic process of storing heat 
and responding to increased levels of 
greenhouse gases is not immediate, 
and can often take years for the full 
effect to be reached, which makes it 
all the more crucial that we begin to 
take initiative and claim responsibil-
ity for the problem NOW.
Despite the overwhelming sci-
enti?c data, President-elect Trump 
fails to accept that climate change 
is REAL and MATTERS. To put it in 
Trump’s terms, equating the earth to 
a business deal, then passing it back 
and forth between politicians and 
neglecting it, is a dangerous move. 
And let’s face it — Donald Trump has 
bankrupted his companies at least six 
times. Not a stellar track record when 
handling a deal as ‘huge’ as the earth.
When has a matter of biased 
opinion ever been more correct than 
scienti?c evidence except in the po-
litical scene? The fact remains — you 
can’t change the truth, no matter 
how much you dismiss it.
Our choices right now will dictate 
the narrative we will set for life on 
this earth. We have the potential to 
shape the future. A denial of science 
is a step in the wrong direction for 
us. And, moreover, time and global 
warming won’t wait for us to catch 
back up before it’s too late and 
irreversible damage has been 
done. It is high time that we 
stopped turning our backs 
and making excuses, and 
do the right thing for our 
home. This is a global 
problem, and it is time 
to come together and 
work as one rather 
than push each 
other apart. The 
earth is crying out, 
but we can’t hear 
it over the sound 
of our squabbling 
nations.
November 21, 2016 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A5
Cabinet is already set to contain an 
anti-semitic white supremacist, and 
Trump has pledged to sign the First 
Amendment Defense Act, a bill that 
would forbid the government from 
“discriminating” against any person 
who denies a service or product — 
even hospital visitation rights, con-
traception, or treatment for STDs — 
to gay couples, unmarried couples, 
or women on the basis of their reli-
gious beliefs.
Instead, rather than dismissing 
people’s overwhelming lists of con-
cerns immediately, our efforts may 
be better served by trying to address 
the many problems that gave them 
cause for concern in the ?rst place. 
Everyone needs to come together to 
ensure that vulnerable groups aren’t 
abandoned to a history that repeats 
itself in devastating ways.
At the same time, the rhetoric dis-
missing all Trump supporters — and 
Republicans in general — as nothing 
more than racist, uneducated people 
incapable of voting in even their own 
best interest is equally unhelpful, 
and also needs to change in order to 
improve the country for everyone.
First of all, these assessments are 
reductive and, in many instances, 
simply not true. Nate Cohn, who 
covers elections, polling, and de-
mographics for The New York Times, 
observed that “Clinton suffered her 
biggest losses in the places where 
Obama was strongest among white 
voters.” Obviously some hateful rac-
ists and bigots were able to celebrate 
their own terrible views by becom-
ing avid Trump supporters, but a lot 
of people who ended up voting Re-
publican were swayed by a variety 
of other factors. It’s heartbreaking 
that people decided to compromise 
on treating minorities as equals, but 
that’s not the way everyone was able 
to rationalize the choice.
Furthermore, there are actually a 
number of studies that suggest that, 
as a whole, Republicans are both 
more open-minded and knowledge-
able than Democrats are today. Lib-
erals are also more likely to block 
someone with differing opinions on 
social media sites, rather than enter-
ing a conversation and trying to edu-
cate them about their views.
But secondly, refusing to acknowl-
edge the concerns of a huge portion 
of our country on the grounds that 
they just aren’t decent enough to de-
serve it is dangerous, and might be a 
large contributing factor to Trump’s 
victory in the ?rst place. “No party 
these past decades has effectively 
represented the interests of these 
dispossessed,” Emmett Rensin stated 
in a Vox article titled The Smug Style 
in American Liberalism. “Only one 
has made a point of openly disdain-
ing them too.”
Is it really a surprise that these 
disenchanted voters, with self es-
teem that repeatedly suffers hits 
from an unsympathetic public and 
who are faced with increasingly 
bleak prospects, turned away from 
the candidate who called them “de-
plorables” and has long been seen as 
a Wall Street insider? Are college-ed-
ucated liberals with a good chance of 
landing a successful career and being 
able to support their families in a po-
sition to judge them for that choice?
Ultimately, there is no excuse for 
any of the bigoted opinions that have 
gained both spotlight and legitimacy 
now that the man preaching them 
has been not punished, but elected 
our leader. At the same time, there 
is also no excuse for writing off a 
huge percentage of the population as 
uneducated, uninformed, and mor-
ally inferior, simultaneously shutting 
down any chance for them to bring 
their own struggles to light. In an 
election with candidates as ?awed 
and contested as this one has been, 
both sides had to set aside some 
of their misgivings and do what 
they felt best ensured their success 
and happiness. 
If we want to stop this from hap-
pening ever again, all of these mis-
givings — from both sides — need 
to be addressed with empathy and 
respect in the future.

For every gender barrier that has 
been broken down, there have been 
brave women to strike the ?rst blow. 
The world of journalism is no ex-
ception. This week, journalists and 
broadcasters are mourning the loss 
of Gwen I?ll, who, as a journalist, 
carved a path as a black woman in a 
?eld dominated by white men.
I?ll, who had been battling with 
cancer, died on Monday at a hos-
pice in Washington, D.C. She was 61 
years old at the time of her death.
I?ll is best known for her work 
covering the White House, Con-
gress, and national campaigns over 
the past three decades as a journalist 
and broadcaster for The Washington 
Post, The New York Times, NBC, and 
PBS. She moderated the vice presi-
dential debates during the 2004 and 
2008 elections, was the moderator 
and managing editor for “Washing-
ton Week” on PBS, and, with col-
league and fellow trailblazer Judy 
Woodruff, hosted PBS’ nightly news 
program, “NewsHour.” Together, 
she and Woodruff made up the ?rst 
all-female news anchor team on net-
work nightly news.
As media goes, broadcast jour-
nalism has presented largely white, 
male anchors. In an interview with 
The New York Times, I?ll stated, 
“When I was a little girl watching 
programs like this — because that’s 
the kind of nerdy family we were — 
I would look up and not see anyone 
who looked like me in any way. No 
women. No people of color. I’m very 
keen about the fact that a little girl 
now, watching the news, when they 
see me and Judy [Woodruff] sitting 
side by side, it will occur to them 
that that’s perfectly normal — that 
it won’t seem like any big break-
through at all.”
And that is exactly what she did. 
I?ll made herself visible, she did not 
back down as a reporter, and she 
embraced the fact that it’s very hard 
to be a trailblazer.
Especially on a platform like 
broadcast media, there are many 
stereotypes for women to break 
down. Too often, women on televi-
sion are objecti?ed, made to be like 
props rather than people with opin-
ions, or overshadowed in debates 
and nightly broadcasts.
I?ll, however, made her voice 
heard loud and clear. She asked 
tough questions and expected the 
most out of her coworkers and 
guests. She did not let the gender 
bias in her industry speak for her, 
and she was much more than a 
pretty face on TV. When I?ll deliv-
ered the news, she didn’t deliver the 
news as a female newscaster, she de-
livered the news as a newscaster — 
her gender didn’t matter.
Of course trailblazers have their 
speed bumps, and I?ll had to deal 
with her fair share. Hate mail from 
racist viewers, or sexist viewers, 
would ?ll her inbox, but she didn’t let 
that stop her from continuing to de-
liver only the highest quality of jour-
nalism. She took everything with a 
grain of salt and moved forward.
It can be dif?cult being a trail-
blazer, being a pioneer. It can be 
dif?cult when the rest of the world 
does not believe that you can do it, 
not because you have proven your-
self unquali?ed but because of your 
race and gender. But Gwen I?ll 
handled the burden with grace and 
power, and will be greatly missed.

SCITECH BRIEFS
Stephen Hawking gives humanity 1000 years to ?nd planet
Speaking at the Oxford 
University Union, Stephen 
Hawking admitted that hu-
manity’s survival is dismal 
in the distant future, noting 
that “although the chance of 
a disaster to planet Earth in a 
given year may be quite low, 
it adds up over time, and be-
comes a near certainty in the 
next 1,000 or 10,000 years.”
Many factors can render the 
planet uninhabitable if given 
1,000 years. Global warming 
does not seem to be slowing, 
but increasing exponentially. 
Frequent epidemics, such as 
the Ebola and Zika viruses, 
are also on the rise. “By that 
time we should have spread 
out into space, and to other 
stars,” Hawking remarked. “So 
a disaster on Earth would not 
mean the end of the human 
race.” Premonitions similar to 
Hawking’s are partially what 
drive today’s rush for the colo-
nization of Mars.

Dinosaurs may have existed 20 million years earlier
Paleontologists at 
Macquarie University em-
ployed a novel dating method 
involving probability to in-
crease the accuracy of the fos-
sil record. A new family tree of 
over 1,000 species, the largest 
ever, was assembled to aid in 
the design of a probabilistic 
framework of ?rst occurrences 
of speci?c species. 
Paleontologists found 
that the likelihood of discov-
ering the very ?rst fossils is 
very minute, and so intro-
duced probabilistic methods 
to increase accuracy of their 
estimates. 
They found that the very 
?rst dinosaurs were present 
at the end of the Permian-Tri-
assic period, 250 million years 
ago, meaning early dinosaurs 
somehow survived the larg-
est mass extinction event in 
Earth’s history.
The entire study was pub-
lished in Biology Letters.

China uses CRISPR, gene-editing to ?ght cancer cells
Scientists at Sichuan Uni-
versity injected a patient suf-
fering from metazoic lung can-
cer with white blood cells that 
were edited using Clustered 
Regularly Interspaced Short 
Palindromic Repeats (CRIS-
PR). This is the ?rst known 
instance of  the application of 
the CRISPR technology on  hu-
man beings. 
CRISPR are segments of 
prokaryotic DNA that enable 
faster, cheaper, and more ac-
curate gene editing. The new 
white blood cells, T-Lymhot-
cytes, targeted and attacked 
rogue cancer cells.
Sichuan University re-
ceived ethical clearance for its 
trial within six months. Seek-
ing the same approval would 
have taken much longer here 
in the United States. Scientists 
are hopeful that competition 
between China, and the U.S. 
will drive the latter to acceler-
ate gene-editing research.

Pluto may have oceans underneath its icy surface
Scientists have newfound 
evidence of a sub-surface 
ocean on the icy dwarf-planet 
Pluto. Analysis of data sent 
back by NASA’s New Hori-
zon space probe,which made 
the closest ?yby of Pluto last 
year, shows compelling signs 
of water bodies below the 
ice surface. This adds Pluto 
to the list of worlds in the so-
lar system believed to harbor 
hidden water oceans, which 
are highly probable incubators 
of extra-terrestrial life. Pluto’s 
oceans are not the most likely 
candidates for alien sightings, 
however, due to their harsh, 
cold conditions.
Pluto’s supposed ocean 
is estimated to be 150 to 200 
kilometers below the sur-
face and 62 kilometers deep. 
Internal exothermic processes 
in Pluto’s core are what could 
keep water liquid despite the 
planet’s great distance from 
the sun.

Zika virus no longer an international health emergency
The Zika virus, the dis-
ease that ravaged Brazil and 
Florida, is no longer an inter-
national emergency according 
to the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO). This does not 
mean the virus is eradicated or 
ceased to be a threat, however. 
“We are not downgrading the 
importance of Zika,” said Pete 
Salama, executive director of 
WHO. “By placing it as a lon-
ger-term program of work, we 
are saying Zika is here to stay 
and WHO’s response is here to 
stay.” 
The Zika virus was de-
clared a Public Health Emer-
gency in February 2016, after 
it was linked to birth defects 
such as microcephaly and neu-
rological complications. The 
disease will likely continue to 
spread in areas with the mos-
quito vector since its spread 
depends on the  Aedes aegypti 
mosquitoes that act as carriers 
to that virus.

Alaska Airlines ?ies ?rst biofuel-powered engine
Commercial airline Alaska 
Airlines ?ew its ?rst ?ight 
with 20 percent biofuel. The 
fuel was made from forest tree 
limbs and branches, devel-
oped at Washington State Uni-
versity with aid from North-
west Advanced Renewables 
Alliance. Moreover, it is chem-
ically indistinguishable from 
usual kerosene-based jet fuel. 
Joe Sprague of Alaska Air-
lines commented, “This latest 
milestone in Alaska’s efforts to 
promote sustainable biofuels 
is especially exciting since it 
is uniquely sourced from the 
forest residuals in the Paci?c 
Northwest.” 
This feat comes at a time 
when contrails and jet engine 
emissions are under scrutiny 
from the environmental com-
munity.

Carnegie Mellon colloquium explores arti?cial intelligence

NAVIYA SINGLA
Assistant SciTech Editor
The Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace 
(CEIP) and Carnegie Mellon 
University held the ?rst part 
of the two-part joint Carn-
egie Colloquium on Digital 
Governance and Security in 
Washington D.C. on Oct. 31. 
The ?rst part of the 
colloquium was titled “The 
Rise of Arti?cial Intelligence: 
Implications for Military Op-
erations and Privacy,” and 
the second part, titled “The 
Future of the Internet: Gov-
ernance and Con?ict,” will be 
held this year in Pittsburgh on 
Dec. 2. 
CEIP is a series of foreign 
policy-based research centers 
located in Russia, China, Eu-
rope, the Middle East, India, 
and the United States, with 
headquarters in Washington 
D.C., that collects itself under 
the phrase, “The Global Think 
Tank.” It was established in 
1960 by Andrew Carnegie 
and, according to a report by 
the University of Pennsylva-
nia, is the third most in?uen-
tial think tank in the world. 
The colloquium, held for 
the bene?t of both Carnegie 
Mellon and the CEIP, aimed 
to allow for communication 
between the academics at 
Carnegie Mellon and the for-
eign policy and ethics experts 
from all the CEIP stations 
across the world to discuss 
the implication of arti?cial 
intelligence on foreign policy 
and the challenges posed by 
it. The second part of the col-
loquium will focus on cyber-
security norms and internet 
governance. 
“Designing safe software 
systems and attempting to 
create the learning abilities of 
the human brain are natural 
progressions towards the two 
of the modern world’s most 
pressing concerns — cyber 
security and privacy,” said 
President Subra Suresh, in 
the welcome address. He ex-
plained that discussion, such 
as the one facilitated by the 
colloquium, would help shape 
thought about the effects of 
technology on global society 
and diplomacy.
The colloquium consisted 
of three panel discussions 
with experts from both sides. 
The ?rst panel was “The Fu-
ture of Consumer Privacy: 
Machine Learning and New 
International Data Protec-
tion,” and was introduced by 
Andrew Moore, Dean of the 
School of Computer Science 
at Carnegie Mellon.

Within the past 
100 years, trans-
portation methods 
have exponentially 
increased in speed 
and ?uidity. From 
boats, to cars, to 
planes, to space 
travel, there have 
been major break-
throughs in terms 
of fuel and engine 
ef?ciency, design, 
and speed of travel 
from one location to 
another, and there’s 
about to be another 
breakthrough — the 
Hyperloop.
The Hyperloop is a system 
that would allow people to 
travel from Los Angeles to San 
Francisco, which would take 
?ve and a half hours by car, in 
a mere 35 minutes. It sounds 
amazing, and also like some-
thing out of science ?ction.
But Elon Musk, most 
known for SpaceX and Tesla 
Motors, has been trying to 
make science ?ction into sci-
ence fact for the past few 
years, hosting an open SpaceX 
Hyperloop Pod Competition 
to see who can design and 
build the best Hyperloop pod. 
Here at Carnegie Mellon, 
we have our own Hyperloop 
design team, which placed 
in the top 30 out of over 
1,300 teams in January 
2016 and is looking to take 
home the title in the com-
petition’s ?nal on-track 
competition in January 2017.
In a 57-page paper entitled 
“Hyperloop Alpha” that Musk 
posted on the SpaceX website, 
he wrote, “The Hyperloop (or 
something similar) is, in my 
opinion, the right solution for 
the speci?c case of high traf-
?c city pairs that are less than 
about 1500 km or 900 miles 
apart. Around that in?ection 
point, I suspect that super-
sonic air travel ends up being 
faster and cheaper.”
The technology to make a 
Hyperloop seems far out, and 
as one HowStuffWorks article 
describes it, “It’s sort of like 
traveling in a bullet through 
a shotgun barrel partly using 
technology from an air hock-
ey game.”
The Hyperloop appears to 
be a cross between a train and 
a plane, with pods traveling 
through steel tubes mounted 
on reinforced concrete pylons 
spaced out 100 feet apart that 
can withstand Californian 
earthquakes.
In Musk’s own words, “This 
is where things get tricky.”
Musk has gone through a 
number of potential solutions 
for this feat of physics, only to 
rule most out. Using powerful 
fans to push the pods would 
create too much unwanted 
friction within the tubes, 
slowing the pods down. 
Using electromagnetic 
suspension would require a 
perfect vacuum within the 
tubes, which is near impos-
sible with the amount of traf-
?c that would occur in and 
out of the tubes each day and 
would be ruined with even 
the slightest crack in the tube.
Instead, Musk is proposing 
using two elevated tubes, one 
North and one South, which 
would travel parallel to Inter-
state 5. 
The tubes would have re-
duced air pressure inside, 
estimated to be one-sixth of 
the air pressure on Mars, to 
reduce drag within the tube 
from the pods.
The goal is to keep the 
tube tracks as low-tech as 
possible, instead focusing on 
the design of the pods to ac-
quire most of the speed. A key 
feature of the pod designs is 
to have them with metal skis 
with magnets on the bottom 
that ride on a cushion of air 
pumped through the skis. 
The initial takeoff of the pods 
would be due to an electro-
magnetic pulse to the bottom 
of the skis.
Along the track, linear in-
duction motors will keep the 
pods at a constant speed, 
getting their power from a 
combination of batteries 
and solar panels placed 
on top of the tubes.
As with any 
transportation vehicle, pas-
senger comfort and safety are 
the top priority. There will 
be emergency exits placed 
all along the tube, and pods 
would be timed so that they 
leave one at a time. 
Some of the downsides 
so far are that the pods will 
be very cozy and may induce 
claustrophobia, and there 
has been no mention of a 
bathroom so far. Although, 
standing up in a vehicle go-
ing that fast may not be the 
best idea anyway. With some 
of the brightest young minds 
working on this problem, the 
Hyperloop may very well be a 
reality in our lifetime. 
Regardless, 
this concept is 
revolutionizing 
the way people 
view travel and 
transportation, 
and may open 
the vein for oth-
er possibilities.
Transporta-
tion plays such 
a large role from 
scales of local 
comerce to inter-
national trade. 
Having safe and 
fast transporta-
tion can drasti-
cally change the 
world.

CFO of DOE talks ?nance
JADON GROVE
Junior Staffwriter
The Chief Financial 
Of?cer (CFO) of the U.S. 
Department of Energy 
(DOE) Joseph Hezir spoke 
at Carnegie Mellon on Nov. 
11 as part of the Scott Insti-
tute for Energy Innovation’s 
Distinguished Lecture Series. 
As the president-appointed 
head of the Of?ce of the Chief 
Financial Of?cer, Hezir is 
responsible for the manage-
ment and ?nancial integrity 
of all of the DOE programs, 
resources, and activities. This 
includes determining how to 
distribute the yearly budget 
that is tentatively proposed 
to be $32.5 billion for the 
2017 ?scal year. His presen-
tation last week aimed to 
describe the need for innova-
tion in the energy ?eld, to de-
?ne the Mission Innovation 
program, and to show the 
tentative process for the ap-
propriation of the upcoming 
DOE budget.
Ed Rubin, Alumni Chair 
Professor in the environmen-
tal engineering department 
and professor in the engi-
neering and public policy de-
partment at Carnegie Mellon, 
introduced Hezir, explaining 
their close connection as for-
mer professor and student, 
and mentioning Hezir’s many 
achievements since attend-
ing Carnegie Mellon. Hezir 
received his undergraduate 
degree in chemical engineer-
ing (CIT ‘72) and a master’s 
degree in public policy from 
the Heinz College (HNZ ‘74) 
and then transitioned into a 
career focused on policy.
Hezir spoke ?rst about the 
value of innovation and the 
bene?t of government-fund-
ed research. His case-study 
for this point was the adop-
tion of clean energy technol-
ogies such as solar power and 
LED lights. The issue is not 
that the technologies aren’t 
bene?cial or that they aren’t 
being adopted; the issue is 
that the adoption of current 
technologies alone will not 
shift the country to what he 
labeled “deep decarboniza-
tion.” Hezir called for an ag-
gressive technology innova-
tion program as the solution 
to move the country closer to 
that clean energy goal.
He then moved on to a 
discussion about what he 
hopes the policy approach 
for this task will be: Mis-
sion Innovation. This global 
initiative, signed in 2015 at 
the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference (COP21) 
in Paris, France, is an 
agreement between twenty 
countries to increase funding 
in clean energy research two-
fold by the year 2021. This 
group of countries comprises 
60 percent of the world’s 
population and two-thirds of 
the world’s greenhouse gas 
emissions. The doubling, he 
explained, would add rough-
ly $35 billion to the devel-
opment of newer and more 
ef?cient energy techniques 
in the United States over the 
next ?ve years.
One of the points Hezir 
focused on here was the 
faith that the administra-
tion would be placing in the 
?nancial investments. He ac-
knowledged that many clean 
energy technologies will take 
more than a typical short-
term horizon on the invest-
ment. They will often require 
many years to materialize 
and then be applicable.
Hezir then transitioned to 
the topic of categories within 
the DOE, attempting to an-
swer the question: how do 
we appropriate a doubling in 
funding? He explained that 
the increases wouldn’t be 
consistent across the depart-
ment. For example, on one 
hand, the Energy Ef?ciency & 
Renewable Energy of?ce will 
receive a signi?cant amount 
of new money, while on the 
other, the Fossil Energy of?ce 
will receive less.
He explained that some 
of the current categories 
are unnecessarily dif?cult 
to work with. There is a cur-
rent push within the DOE 
for a rearrangement of de-
partments from categorizing 
based on energy source to a 
system with of?ces organized 
around applications.
Hezir also touched on the 
format of funding, discussing 
some of the more novel ideas 
for funding techniques. An 
example he described was 
an innovation ecosystem in 
which multiple facets such 
as a university, a national 
lab, and energy companies 
are all close together. The 
regional focus would pro-
vide increased funding in the 
block format for areas that 
have such development in 
an effort to improve growth 
more naturally. Through-
out Hezir’s presentation, a 
single question permeated: 
“How can the DOE most ef-
fectively spend a dollar of in-
vestment?” It is Hezir’s hope 
that aggressive investment in 
more precise ?elds is a broad 
idea that will improve clean 
energy within the United 
States.
Hezir closed by taking 
some questions. In response 
to an audience member who 
asked the obvious question 
about the role of the DOE in a 
Trump administration, Hezir 
acknowledged the clear is-
sues that may arise, but also 
provided some optimism. 
The CFO position, along with 
many other leadership posi-
tions within the DOE, is an 
appointed position, but he 
ended with the hope that the 
future leaders of the depart-
ment, as well as President-
elect Trump, will recognize 
the importance of govern-
ment investment in energy 
research and continue with 
the proposed improvements.

tor for the Scott Institute for

Trump presidency leads to uncertainty for future of science
ROB MACEDO
Special to The Tartan
Recent events have led to 
many questions about the fu-
ture of our country, one major 
question being: What exactly 
does the Donald Trump presi-
dency mean for the future 
of science and technology in 
the United States? Trump’s 
personal quips on the subject 
seem at best immature, sim-
ple, and uninformed, and at 
worst anti-fact. Yet, the forces 
and motives that have led to 
his unprecedented presidency 
are complex and nuanced, and 
paint an uncertain picture of 
the future for science in the 
United States.
On one hand, there are 
many signs that we are en-
tering a dark age of scienti?c 
Armageddon. Trump has put 
a prominent climate change 
skeptic in charge of his Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) transition team, and has 
publicly questioned climate 
change himself. He has sup-
ported claims that vaccines 
cause autism, and in general 
has expressed contempt for 
the scienti?c community. 
There is ample evidence that a 
Trump presidency could lead 
to a decrease in both funding 
and respect for science in 
America, and possibly in the 
world. This may be the tipping 
point for global catastrophes 
such as climate change, and 
this election will forever be re-
membered as the beginning of 
the end.
On the other hand, such 
fears may be somewhat alarm-
ist. In fact, in many ways 
Trump could act as a catalyst 
to a certain type of scienti?c 
and technological progress in 
the United States. Trump rose 
to power because of a nation-
alism that — while in many 
ways is fearfully similar to 
the jingoism that beget Nazi 
Germany — is also not unlike 
the American fervor that pro-
pelled the United States sci-
enti?cally and technologically 
after the second world war. 
For example, the 1960s space 
race that led to an acceleration 
of technological innovation 
was very much fueled by a na-
tionalist and globally competi-
tive atmosphere. This type of 
research — large, ?ashy, and 
militaristic — may be perfect-
ly in-sync with Trump’s (and 
more importantly, Trump’s 
supporters’) agenda.
If marketed correctly, in-
vestment into clean energy 
could capture America’s imag-
ination the way the space race 
so classically did. Currently, 
China is leading the world in 
clean energy research by a 
signi?cant margin. If Trump 
and his supporters do truly 
wish to dominate China in all 
manners, we must increase 
expenditure in clean energy 
technologies. If the motive is 
spun not as an attack on fossil 
fuel industries, but rather a re-
juvenation of American might, 
clean energy research could 
potentially receive a boost.
Yet, this could all be overly 
optimistic thinking about an 
administration that has great 
disdain for scienti?c inquiry, 
particularly climate change. 
While we may see growth in 
showy and defense-focused 
research, funding for funda-
mental climate research could 
wane, not unlikely funding 
cuts for stem cell research in 
the George W. Bush era. In 
fact, countries such as France 
have threatened to place tar-
iffs on U.S. goods if the U.S. 
refuses to address climate 
change. This, coupled with 
Trump’s predilection for iso-
lationism, could destroy the 
global competitiveness of 
American products (not to 
the mention the environment 
as well). As many articles on 
the subject have espoused, we 
honestly do not know exactly 
what Trump means for the 
future of science and technol-
ogy. In this scenario, the only 
thing that is truly certain is 
uncertainty.
Student Pugwash is a 
non-advocacy, educational or-
ganization that discusses the 
implications of science. This ar-
ticle is a summary of last week’s 
discussion on how a Trump 
administration will affect 
future science and technol-
ogy policy.

learning, saying, “privacy 
and personalization, which 
seem like clear goods, lead 
us to very dif?cult societal 
and technical challenges.” He 
then explained four ?ctional, 
but relatable scenarios that 
shed better light on the di-
lemma posed by this intersec-
tion of technology and policy 
including law-enforcement 
and medical use of data. 
He referred to the data 
of Matt Fredrikson – an 
Associate Professor in the 
School of Computer Science 
that reveals the trade-off be-
tween privacy levels and lives 
saved or years of lives saved, 
to caution against “being on 
either extreme end of that 
trade-off” and say that “we 
should ?nd our place in the 
middle of that trade-off.” 
This panel’s speakers 
included Edward Felten, 
a computer scientist and 
deputy U.S. chief technology 
of?cer at the White House Of-
?ce of Science and Technol-
ogy Policy; Yuet Ming Tham, 
a partner at Sidley Austin’s 
Hong Kong of?ce who focus-
es on privacy, cross-border 
compliance, and investiga-
tions; and Paul Timmers, di-
rector of the Sustainable & 
Secure Society Directorate 
in the European Commission 
Communications Networks, 
Content and Technologies 
Directorate General (DG 
CONNECT).
Following the panel were 
robot presentations by Carne-
gie Mellon Robotics Institute 
professors. These included 
the snakebots by Howie Cho-
set, a professor of robotics; 
the ballbot by Ralph Hollis, a 
professor of robotics; and the 
Robotanist by George Kantor, 
a senior systems scientist.
Finally, the last panel, 
titled “International Perspec-
tives: Autonomy and Coun-
ter-autonomy in Military 
Operations,” was introduced 
by David Brumley, director of 
CyLab Security and Privacy 
Institute at Carnegie Mellon 
University. The speakers in-
cluded Lt. Gen. Dr. R.S. Pan-
war, the former colonel com-
mandant of the Indian Army 
Corps of Signals; Daniel Re-
isner, a partner at Herzog, 
Fox & Neeman; and Mary 
Wareham, advocacy director 
of the Arms Division at Hu-
man Rights Watch and global 
coordinator of the Campaign 
to Stop Killer Robots.
Jim Garrett, the Dean of 
CMU’s College of Engineer-
ing explains in the university 
press release about the col-
loquium, “The wide span of 
impact from arti?cial intelli-
gence and cybersecurity de-
mands these kinds of interna-
tional discussions, ... These 
forums provide an exchange 
of ideas, an appreciation for 
a wide variety of views and a 
debate on tough topics.” 
Thus, the Colloquium is a 
great way to open discussions 
about arti?cial intelligence 
and its implications, and the 
second part is sure to bring 
more interesting   and valu-
able discussion as well.

The Tartan fantasy football league takes a creative turn
JADE CROCKEM
Operations Manager
Fantasy football has been 
quite the source of excitement 
in the Tartan of?ce. Although 
some of us are still a little con-
fused about what’s actually 
going on, some of us (mainly 
me) have truly begun to shine. 
Everyone has gotten pretty 
invested in their team, doing 
everything from trash talking 
to intense planning. We are 
?nally in week 10 of our Tar-
tan fantasy league, and it was 
quite a shake-up. I was not 
the overall loser, but opted to 
write the article because I live 
for any chance I get to roast 
people. I’ve been killing the 
fantasy game lately and with 
four wins in a row under my 
belt, I’m excited to head into 
the next week and make it ?ve. 
However, I can’t jump to week 
11 without ?rst talking about 
my  amazing week 10.
This week I went up against 
Sports Editor Alex Wood, and 
I’d like to say that I completely 
destroyed him. Wood had a 
pretty good week with quar-
terback Cam Newton complet-
ing 23 of 38 passes for 261 
yards for a total of 23 points. 
Dez Bryant also brought him 
a decent number of points 
catching six of nine targets 
for a total of 116 yards and a 
touchdown pass for a total of 
23 points. None of this was 
enough however to win after 
the Cowboys’ Ezekiel Elliott 
brought me in a whopping 40 
points by rushing 21 times for 
114 yards and scoring three 
touchdowns. Despite the fact 
that I had a few single scor-
ing players and left 22 points 
on my bench with Demaryius 
Thomas and 21 points with 
Davante Adams, I was still 
able to take home the victory 
thanks to Elliot’s outstanding 
performance and continue my 
four game winning streak.
This is one of those weeks 
where Forum Editor Sinead 
Foley appeared to really not 
know what was going on. De-
spite not setting her line up 
and leaving Marvin Jones, 
who was on bye week, in her 
lineup, she still had some luck 
on her side and was able to 
rack up a respectable number 
of points. Running back Ryan 
Matthews brought her in 29 
points after he rushed a total 
of 109 yards and caught two 
passes for an additional 30 
yards. Quarterback Blake Bor-
tles also racked up a decent 
number of points after com-
pleting 32 of 49 passes. How-
ever, this wasn’t enough to 
stop Le’Veon Bell who brought 
Pillbox Editor Abhishek Tayal 
33 points after catching nine 
of ten targets and a touch-
down pass.
Foley didn’t seem to be any 
more aware of her second team 
as she left Golden Tate — who 
was also on bye week — in her 
lineup. Stefon Diggs still man-
aged to score her 29 points 
after catching for 164 yards. 
Her quarterback Marcus Mari-
ota also managed to rack up 
27 points after completing 19 
passes for 295 yards. It wasn’t 
enough to stop Online Editor 
India Price though. LeGarrette 
Blount scored her 24 points 
after carrying for 69 yards and 
scoring three touchdowns. 
Her quarterback Eli Manning 
also brought in a decent 17 
points in the Giants win over 
the Bengals. A.J. Green also 
brought in a solid 19 points 
after catching seven passes 
for a total of 68 yards. Price 
brought her A game this week, 
but will she be able to pull off 
this kind of win next week 
when she’s a playing a team 
that will probably remember 
to set their lineup?
Layout Manager Zeke 
Rosenberg took home the vic-
tory over former personnel 
manager Lula Beresford. De-
spite not even having DeMarco 
Murray in his lineup this week, 
he still ranked up quite a few 
points from players like Jordy 
Nelson who scored 30 points 
after completing 12 catches 
for 126 yards and scoring a 
touchdown. Antonio Brown 
also brought in 35 point. 
Beresford still put up a good 
?ght with wide receiver Allen 
Robinson after gaining 107 
yards and a touchdown pass 
for a total of 27 points. How-
ever, the Cowboys defense 
scoring her -3 points did not 
help. As the resident Cowboys 
fan of The Tartan, I would like 
to apologize on their behalf. 
At least we beat the Steelers 
though! #WeDemBoyz
Assistant Sports Editor 
Ian Tanaya had a pretty good 
week with almost all of his 
players scoring in the double 
digits. Odell Beckham Jr. 
brought him in 25 points af-
ter catching 10 of 11 targets 
and scoring a touchdown. 
Larry Fitzgerald also scored 25 
points after completing 12 re-
ceptions. The Ravens defense 
also brought him in a whop-
ping 16 points after catch-
ing two interceptions against 
Cleveland Browns. Publisher 
Sarah Gutekunst did not fare 
as well this week with almost 
half of her team scoring in 
the single digits. Quarterback 
Russell Wilson brought her 
in a respectable 25 points by 
completing 25 of 37 passes for 
348 yards, three touchdowns, 
and no interceptions. Running 
back C.J. Prosise also scored 
her 21 points after rushing 
for 66 yards in his ?rst ca-
reer start. However, it wasn’t 
enough to beat Tanaya.
In the end, some won, 
some lost, some trash talked, 
and some received trash talk-
ing, but everyone is sure to 
step up their game (and set 
their lineup) for week 11. I’m 
facing off against my best 
friend, roommate, and literal 
other half, Price this week so 
the loser is sure to experience 
the brunt of the loss for weeks 
to come. Stay tuned.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team de-
fended their home court on 
Thursday, Nov. 17 against the 
La Roche College Redhawks. 
The Tartans played a hard 
fought match but ended up 
falling to the Redhawks, 66–
61. The loss puts the Tartans 
at an even 1–1 record for the 
season.
The Tartans jumped out 
to an early lead, but couldn’t 
hold on to it as the Redhawks 
went on a 12–2 run that lasted 
most of the ?rst quarter. La 
Roche carried their early mo-
mentum all the way into half-
time, and Carnegie Mellon 
was looking out of sorts. The 
game went to intermission 
with the Redhawks leading 
33–25 and hungry for more.
The Tartans started to see 
some real offensive produc-
tion in the second half, but 
they couldn’t match the at-
tack of the visiting team. The 
Tartans were down six points 
with 12 minutes left to play 
when they ?nally found a 
glimpse of hope with seven 
unanswered points. 
That hope quickly faded as 
the Redhawks repeated their 
12–2 run from earlier in the 
game and put the Tartans out 
for good.
Senior center Chris Shkil 
led the Tartans with 16 points, 
eight rebounds, and four 
blocks while his senior for-
ward Jack Serbin, hauled in 
nine rebounds and recorded 
six points. The Tartans will 
look to avenge their loss on 
Tuesday, Nov. 22 when they 
go on the road to take on the 
Allegheny College Gators. The 
game is scheduled for 8 p.m.
Women’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s basketball team kicked 
off their season on Tuesday, 
Nov. 15 at La Roche College. 
The Tartans set the tone for 
their season with a dominat-
ing 74–45 victory, led by se-
nior guard Jackie Hudepohl 
and senior center and forward 
Lisa Murphy who each had a 
double-double.
The Tartans established 
presence early in the game 
with a 10-point lead in the ?rst 
quarter, but the Redhawks 
managed to cut the lead to 
four as the game headed into 
the second quarter. Murphy 
then took over the game and 
scored the next six points for 
the Tartans to put the lead 
back at ten. As the teams went 
into the locker room, Murphy 
scored another point along 
with four points from Hude-
pohl and two free throws from 
?rst-year guard Makayla Fil-
iere. Carnegie Mellon led by 
30 at halftime.
The Tartans took over every 
aspect of the game in the sec-
ond half, and the Redhawks 
couldn’t do anything about 
it. Carnegie Mellon shot 51.5 
percent from the ?eld while 
La Roche was held to only 
34.5 percent. The Redhawks 
also committed 16 turnovers 
in the second half which made 
it nearly impossible for them 
to come from behind and win.
Murphy led the scoring with 
24 points, but Hudepohl was 
right behind her with 22. Mur-
phy also hauled in a whopping 
22 rebounds, and Hudepohl 
earned 10 of her own.
The Tartans went into the 
second game of their early-
season road trip on Friday, 
Nov. 18 in Wilmington, Ohio. 
The Tartans took on Transyl-
vania University and defeat-
ed the Pioneers handily by a 
score of 80–60.
Murphy was the star of 
this game, and ?nished with 
31 points, nine rebounds, and 
?ve blocks. Not only did she 
have a massive scoring night, 
but she didn’t miss a single 
shot. All 12 attempts from 
the ?eld connected along 
with each of her seven free 
throws. Hudepohl also con-
tributed her fair share with 14 
rebounds.
Murphy started a 17–6 
run for The Tartans early in 
the game that set them on 
the path to victory, and they 
would end up leading 49–35 
at the half. The Pioneers tried 
to climb their way back into 
the game, but could only de-
crease the Tartans’ lead to 10 
points. The Tartans decisively 
closed out the game with a 
19–9 run to end the game 
with a 20-point lead. They 
moved on to play Wilmington 
College the following day.

Men’s basketball wins one point thriller in home opener
MARIKA YANG
Junior Staffwriter
On Tuesday, the Carnegie 
Mellon University men’s 
basketball team began the 
2016–2017 season on the right 
foot with a thrilling victory 
at home against the Geneva 
Golden Tornadoes.
The Tartans took to the 
court and got to a fast start, 
quickly scoring two layups. 
They swiftly gained a 12–3 
lead on the Golden Torna-
does, taking advantage of four 
Geneva fouls within the ?rst 
six minutes of the game. The 
Tartans defense forced Ge-
neva to 1-of-10 shots made, 
taking command of the ?ow 
of the game. The Golden Tor-
nadoes, however, fought back 
and drained six consecutive 
buckets to eventually take the 
lead at 20–18 halfway through 
the ?rst half. The Tartans of-
fense missed several shots, 
and were unable to get back 
into the groove they had at the 
beginning of the game. Both 
teams traded shots, but nei-
ther squad established a last-
ing lead.
As the half winded down 
into its ?nal minutes, the Tar-
tans offense began to ?nd its 
momentum again, recovering 
several offensive rebounds 
and scoring on second chance 
shots. They also scored a per-
fect 6-for-6 from the free throw 
line and recorded ?ve steals in 
the half. Carnegie Mellon end-
ed the half on a 10–4 run and 
headed into the locker room 
with a 34–28 lead.
The Tartans came out of 
the halftime break with an ag-
gressive offensive attack and 
soon amassed an 11-point lead 
over Geneva. The Golden Tor-
nadoes refused to allow the 
Tartans to run away with the 
game, slowly coming back and 
cutting the lead in half. Strong 
defense from Carnegie Mellon 
stalled the comeback, but Ge-
neva eventually took the lead 
with ?ve minutes left to play. 
The two teams traded shots, 
and the lead shuf?ed back and 
forth, but The Tartans went 
on to score three consecutive 
baskets to widen the lead. The 
?nal moments included two 
clutch free throws with 8.9 
seconds left to overtake Ge-
neva, 67–66. The Tartans held 
onto the lead and escaped 
with the win.
Senior forward Jack Serbin 
lead the Carnegie Mellon 
team with eighteen points 
and twelve rebounds, the 
32nd double-double of his 
career. Senior center Chris 
Shkil notched a team-leading 
?ve blocks, while also record-
ing his fourth double-double 
of the season with thirteen 
points and fourteen rebounds. 
The two teams played with 
different styles; Geneva took 
nearly twice as many three-
point shots as Carnegie Mel-
lon, while the Tartans scored 
42 points in the paint to 
Geneva’s 26. Another differ-
ence in the game was second 
chance points. The Tartans 
scored 16 points off of offen-
sive rebounds, while Geneva 
scored 7 points.
 Carnegie Mellon won the 
turnover battle, with 11 turn-
overs to Geneva’s 14. They 
also scored more points off of 
turnovers than Geneva did. 
In order to continue im-
proving as the basketball 
season gets into full swing, 
the Tartans need to be more 
aggressive on defense to pre-
vent opponents’ shooting and 
speed from overpowering 
them. The Carnegie Mellon 
squad began their season with 
a win, starting off with a 1–0 
record. They moved on to play 
La Roche College two days 
later, but fell to the Redhawks 
61–66, putting them at a 1–1 
record for the season.
The Tartans go on the road 
on Tuesday, Nov. 22 to take on 
the Allegheny College Gators. 
The game is scheduled for 8 
p.m., and the road to the play-
offs starts now for this team.

The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s basketball team trav-
eled to Wilmington, Ohio on 
Saturday to face off against the 
Wilmington College Fightin’ 
Quakers in the championship 
game of the Wilmington Tip-
Off Tournament. The Tartans 
earned the victory with a 
thrilling fourth quarter perfor-
mance, and improved to 3–0 
on the season while retaining 
their No. 18 national ranking.
The Tartans opened the 
contest on the offensive, 
scoring the ?rst points of the 
game on a long three-point 
shot from junior guard Anna 
Novak. A Wilmington player 
scored a quick layup in transi-
tion before the Tartans came 
right back as senior guard 
Jackie Hudepohl hit a clean 
jump shot to keep her team in 
the lead. The Fightin’ Quakers 
answered with another layup 
before Novak scored her sec-
ond goal of the quarter to put 
the Tartans up 7–4. First-year 
guard Makayla Filiere drained 
a three-pointer of her own to 
further increase the lead, but 
the Tartans just couldn’t keep 
the opposing offense down. 
The Tartans only allowed two 
more goals in the quarter, and 
even earned another three-
pointer from ?rst-year guard 
Megan Jaeb. The ?rst period 
ended with the Tartans with 
slight lead at 18–13.
The Tartans opened the 
second period with the same 
vigor as they did in the ?rst, 
and sophomore guard Jenn 
Mayberger nailed a three-
point shot to give her team a 
comfortable lead. The teams 
traded layups throughout the 
rest of the half, and Wilm-
ington College began to gain 
momentum with successive 
shots while the Tartans failed 
to convert their possessions 
into points. Senior center Lisa 
Murphy pulled it together for 
the Tartans though, and tied 
the game at 29 with a three-
point shot. It wasn’t enough, 
however, and Wilmington 
ended up outscoring Carnegie 
Mellon and headed into the 
half ahead of the Tartans by 
two points at 37–35.
The third quarter began 
with another three-pointer 
from the rookie Mayberger, 
and eventually the Tartans 
would earn another eight 
points in the quarter. Murphy 
scored four of those points 
and ?rst-year Katharine Hig-
gins contributed the other half 
with a free throw and a three-
point shot. The Tartans then 
made crucial mistakes at the 
end of the quarter and allowed 
the Fightin’ Quakers to take 
the lead at 46–49 with only 10 
minutes left in the game.
The ?rst play of the ?nal 
quarter looked grim for the 
Tartans because it saw Wilm-
ington earn another point on 
a free throw, increasing the 
lead to four points. The Carn-
egie Mellon squad must have 
eaten a large can of spinach 
after that free throw, because 
they came roaring back with a 
quick jumper from Hudepohl 
followed by Mayberger’s third 
three-pointer of the game to 
give the Tartans a 1 point lead 
at 51–50. Novak then hauled in 
a clutch rebound from a failed 
Wilmington layup, and Hude-
pohl turned it into a short shot 
to increase the lead. Wilm-
ington came right back with 
their own jump shot to put 
themselves within one point, 
but then the game stalled out 
and no team could score for 
just over four minutes. Filiere 
would be the one to break 
the drought with 3:33 to play 
by making an incredible steal 
and ?nishing the layup on the 
fast break in true playmaker 
fashion. After her shot, there 
was no doubt that the Tartans 
would win the game.
Oddly enough, the rest 
of the Tartans’ points would 
come from free throws. Mur-
phy made two with just un-
der three minutes left to play 
to put the Tartans up by 5 
points, but Wilmington was 
still ?ghting and managed a 
three-pointer to try and close 
the gap. With less than one 
minute left to play, Murphy 
drained another free throw. 
Wilmington answered with 
another three pointer, but it 
was in vain. The ?nal 30 sec-
onds saw the Fightin’ Quak-
ers foul the Tartans in des-
peration, resulting in ?ve 
successful free throws on the 
part of the Tartans. Carnegie 
Mellon would close out the 
game with a seven-point lead 
at 63–56 to maintain a perfect 
record. The team must travel 
once again for their next con-
test at Waynesburg University 
on Tuesday, Nov. 22. The game 
is scheduled for 6 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s cross country team ?n-
ished off an impressive sea-
son on Saturday, Nov. 19 at 
the NCAA Division III Men’s 
Cross Country Champion-
ships. The Tartan runners 
went on the road to Louis-
ville, Kentucky, where they 
traversed E.P. “Tom” Sawyer 
Park. Even though the Tar-
tans had strong ?nishes in ev-
ery regular season event, they 
weren’t able to pull it together 
for the ?nal competition. That 
said, the Tartan runners were 
up against the best competi-
tion in the nation, and they 
put up a good ?ght. A total of 
278 runners competed in the 
meet, all together represent-
ing 32 schools. The Tartans 
earned 480 points as a team, 
which was enough to earn 
them the 20th spot in the ?nal 
standings. North Central Uni-
versity took the team champi-
onship with 60 points.
The shining beacon of 
light for the Tartans in an 
otherwise disappointing re-
sult was sophomore William 
Mitchell, who had the best 
individual performance of the 
team. He completed the gru-
eling 8k course with a time of 
25:15.1 and ?nished in 72nd 
place overall. This was a sig-
ni?cant improvement over 
last year’s national champion-
ships where he placed 135th. 
Mitchell has had a breakout 
season, with nine top ten 
?nishes, never ending a race 
lower than 26th place until 
this ?nal competition.
The second runner to cross 
the ?nish line was junior 
Ryan Auld, a veteran of the 
team. Auld ?nished the race 
in 25:33.3, and even though 
he was only 20 seconds be-
hind his teammate Mitchell, 
he had to settle for 126th 
place. Auld really came into 
his own this season, ?nding 
two ?rst place ?nishes early 
in the season, while ?nd-
ing himself higher than 20th 
place only four times over the 
course of the entire season. 
Expectations were high for 
Auld coming into the compe-
tition as they were for every-
one on the Tartan squad, but 
the stiff competition proved 
to be too much to handle. The 
cross-country season spans a 
large portion of the year and 
fatigue is one of the most im-
portant factors in determin-
ing who comes out on top at 
these large meets.
The third Tartan to cross 
the ?nish line at the nation 
championships was senior 
Curtis Watro with a time of 
25:43.7. Watro earned 153rd 
place with that time, which 
was a result that did not live 
up to expectations based on 
his performance earlier in the 
season. The spring saw Watro 
earn six ?rst place ?nishes, 
proving himself as one of the 
top runners on the team and 
in the region. As the regu-
lar season came to a close, 
Watro’s ?nishes started to 
slip as he began to earn place-
ments in the high teens and 
20s, which was uncharacter-
istic of him.
The rest of the Tartan team 
crossed the ?nish line soon af-
ter, but it was evident that the 
Tartans had not performed 
as well as they hoped. Junior 
Paul Fleming coasted through 
the end of the race only ?ve 
seconds after Watro, and took 
164th place. The number of 
runners at this meet made the 
competition ?erce, and even 
the smallest measurements 
of time could have been the 
difference between ?rst place 
and tenth place. Rounding 
out the Tartan runners was 
sophomores Jared Moore 
and Aadi Mhatre. Moore re-
corded a time of 25:50.4 to 
take 169th place, and Mhatre 
earned 174th place by cross-
ing the line in 25:51.4.
Senior Ryan Archer unfor-
tunately injured himself dur-
ing the race, but he managed 
to ?nd the strength to push 
through his pain and make 
his way across the ?nish line 
to complete what is likely his 
?nal race as a collegiate ath-
lete. First-year Edward Goe-
bel was also slated to attend 
but could not due to an injury 
late in the season. Goebel 
won the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Rookie Of 
The Year award, so it would 
have been a great opportu-
nity for him to showcase his 
talents. He’ll have to heal up 
and hope that he can be just 
as mobile as he was before his 
injury.
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s cross country team 
also sent one representative 
to the NCAA championships 
on Saturday. Junior Aparna 
Alavilli was selected to attend 
the meet as the third individ-
ual in four years to compete 
on a national level for Carne-
gie Mellon. This year was Ala-
villi’s ?rst time racing on the 
national stage, and she had 
a strong showing with a time 
of 22:01.1 to take 108th place 
out of 280 total runners. She 
also ran the same course ear-
lier in the year, and improved 
her personal time on the track 
by 30 seconds.
Tartan cross-country 
had a season to be proud of. 
They may not have achieved 
the results they wanted on a 
national level, but they de?-
nitely showed their competi-
tors how strong they can be. 
They’ll need to come back 
next season with a vengeance 
if they want to compete on the 
national stage and succeed 
like the winners of the cham-
pionship. But this iteration of 
the team has what it takes to 
win if they choose to work for 
their rewards.

Sarah Gutekunst | Publisheradvice for awkward people
about extended Thanksgiving break
Dear Sarah,
This week will be the first time I’ve gone home all 
semester. I’ve been looking forward to this break for 
literally months. I absolutely crave the comfort of a 
homemade meal with my family, the convenience 
of free laundry that my mom will fold for me, and 
the respite of three measly days where I don’t have 
anything due. Also worth mentioning, I get to see 
my dog for the first time since before the semester! 
I can’t tell you how much I’ve missed all of these 
small treats that I took for granted over the summer. 
Being without them for so long, I will not let myself 
forget to cherish all the best people and things in 
my life.
It’s kind of undeniable that home is better than 
school, where I’m often hungry, tired, alone, and 
too busy to make the time for pesky housekeeping 
like dishes and laundry. I’m excited for Thanksgiving 
break, but I think what I really, deeply, spiritually 
desire is winter break.
Three days isn’t enough. Plus I still have homework 
due next Monday, so even though I’m on break, 
I have to actually be productive. I really need 
time to unplug and stop thinking for a few days, 
but Thanksgiving break just isn’t long enough. 
The very thought of climbing on that Pittsburgh-
bound Megabus on Sunday makes me want to cry 
prematurely. What if I just get a head start on winter 
break and refuse to get on that bus, first day of 
kindergarten style?
What real harm could it bring?
Thanksgiving Broken
Dear Thanksgiving Broken
Well, it could bring some harm, but it really 
depends on your priorities. If you want to get a 
good semester QPA, then missing the last two 
weeks and all of your finals might not be very 
effective. But it sounds to me like what you’re 
really after is some good old R&R. A semester 
at Carnegie Mellon can be extremely stressful, 
damaging to your self-confidence, and downright 
physically exhausting.
I’m lucky enough to have a car on campus and 
live within a reasonable driving distance, so I’ve 
gone home for more weekends than I would 
honestly recommend. Now that I’m a senior, it’s 
not as difficult for me get in the car and come 
back to Carnegie Melloncholy. But back in 
freshman year, I kicked and screamed and cried 
with the best of the kindergarteners. Why would 
I want to go back when I was perfectly happy on 
the couch with my dog Twinkle and all the potato 
chips I could eat? (Thanks, Mommy.)
I could list of tens of reasons not to come back, 
but the reasons we all have to be here are pretty 
compelling. First, your parents (or you, or the 
government, or whoever) are paying for you to be 
here. They would probably be pretty upset if all 
of that money they’re investing in your future went 
down the can. 
And second, the world is beyond crap, and if you 
even hope to have a prayer of finding a job in 
the crap, you better have at least a Bachelor’s 
degree. Make good on your parents’ investment 
so you can pay for their nursing home in 30 years.
Right now the two weeks after Thanksgiving may 
seem unsurvivable. But survival is making it one 
day at a time. Sleep as many hours as you can 
and eat all the food you can fit in your stomach 
while you’re home for break, but when you get 
back (which you will), take the rest of the semester 
step by step. There’s a very bright month-long light 
at the end of the tunnel.
Take care of yourself, and keep your head up!
Sarah
Jiayi Zhao | StaffwriterThe Rover
production brings a new twist to an established classic
Last Friday night, I had the pleasure of 
watching the School of Drama’s latest 
production, The Rover, in the Philip Chosky 
Theater. The show worked beautifully as an 
interesting contrast of experimental interactive 
cinema with decidedly classical 17th century 
Italian themes.
The Rover depicts the struggles of young 
people finding true love in the 17th century. 
The plot is filled with drama and complicated 
relationships, and the cast of Carnegie Mellon 
drama students did a brilliant job portraying 
the rivalries of love, the sisterhood, the 
friendships, and the social relationships of this 
time period in Naples. Every character was 
well cast and the acting was without a doubt 
absolutely spectacular. Most interestingly, even 
the historic Italian accents were perfect.
The set looked like it was straight out of a dream. 
The boards and tinsels added a playful touch to 
the entire carnival theme. A production hand on 
The Rover admitted to working days and nights for 
the show, and sometimes having only 10 minutes 
breaks in between four hour long production 
sessions. He said that the pride he felt on seeing 
the finished product made all the work and 
exhaustion completely worthwhile.
Interactivity was an essential component of the 
performance. Instead of staying on the stage for 
the entire play, the actors actively tried to talk to 
the audience. From trying to praise a beautiful 
lady, to calling out a man and pretending he’s 
part of the play, the actors made the play more 
interesting to watch. In addition, the actors 
made full use of the space and environment of 
the theatre, frequently moving off of the stage 
and walking around, encouraging the audience 
members to turn their heads. This built interest and 
made for an altogether more exciting experience.
If you haven’t watched The Rover yet, and if you 
happen to be interested in 17th century Europe 
and romantic dramas, or intrigued by the idea of 
interactive theatre portraying classical themes, 
this fantastic show is definitely recommended. The 
show runs through Saturday, Dec. 3 and tickets 
can be purchased at the Purnell box office or on 
the School of Drama’s website.

Julia Eve Napolitano | SciTech EditorCMU Jazz Orchestra enthralls
This past Thursday, Nov. 17, the Carnegie Mellon 
University Jazz Ensembles hosted their fall concert 
in Kresge Theatre. The concert was packed, with 
audience members still spilling into the theater 
during the irst few pieces. Even arriving 15 minutes 
early, I was unable to obtain a program.
The Carnegie Mellon University Jazz Orchestra 
started promptly at 7:59 p.m. with Oliver Nelson’s 
1962 “Miss Fine,” a smooth, chill swing song. “Miss 
Fine” was one of Nelson’s irst big band songs, 
with big band referring to a large music ensemble 
with saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a 
rhythm section derived from the Swing era in the 
1920s. In contrast to smaller jazz ensembles, where 
improvisation is featured, big band is often more 
about intricacy and organization.
Eric DeFade, a jazz saxophonist who is a two-
time Grammy-award winner for performances on 
Nancy Wilson’s jazz albums, is the current director 
of the Jazz Orchestra. In the true jazz concert 
fashion, DeFade only occasionally conducted the 
ensemble, instead clapping in time to get them on 
the same tempo and carrying conversations with 
ensemble members during pieces.
Next up was John Coltrane’s 1959 “Naima.” This 
slower ballad, featuring a sax solo and piano solo, 
had many rich chords underlying the melody.
Switching it up a bit, DeFade invited Carnegie 
Mellon alumnus Natasha Patamapongs to the 
stage to sing Clifford Brown’s “Joy Spring.”
Patamapongs earned her BHA at Carnegie Mellon 
with a dual-major in international relations and 
music technology and is currently a master’s 
student in entertainment industry management at 
Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College. As a professional 
jazz singer, she brought cool dynamics and runs to 
the piece, utilizing the microphone to effectively 
throw her voice to the audience.
After her performance, DeFade commented, “It’s 
always nice when someone sings of spring this time 
of year.” The last song of the Jazz Orchestra’s irst 
set was Maynard Ferguson’s “Superbone meets 
that bad man,” featuring the entire trombone 
section. A superbone itself is a hybrid trombone.
Next, the CMU Jazz Improvisation Vocal 
Ensemble (J.I.V.E.), directed by Betsy Lawrence, 
came on stage in their black and red color-
coordinated dress to perform. The instrumentalists 
accompanied the singers from behind, with 
DeFade directing the Orchestra as Lawrence 
directed the singers.
Their set included James Van Heusen’s “Ain’t it a 
kick in the head,” which had really cool dissonant 
harmonies; Luis Demetrio and Pablo Beltrán 
Ruiz’s “¿Quién será?,” a classic Cumbia song 
with a popular English translation by Norman 
Gimbel; Josef Zawinul’s “Birdland,” another classic 
jazz fusion piece featuring a number of soloists 
from J.I.V.E.; and Earth, Wind & Fire’s “Boogie 
Wonderland,” a famous disco song.
This eclectic set was designed to expose 
the performers, both the singers and the 
instrumentalists, to as many styles of jazz as 
possible before going into the industry. To 
transition from J.I.V.E. back to the Jazz Orchestra’s 
second set, they performed Irving Berlin’s “Blue 
Skies,” featuring Marina Byrne, a sophomore vocal 
major, who brought a rich tone to the song.
The Jazz Orchestra started their second set with 
Thad Jones’ “To You,” continuing the style of big 
band, with slow, warm, cluster chords.
Next up was Joey Calderazzo’s “Midnight Voyage,” 
featuring the saxophone section. This piece was 
my personal favorite of the night because of an 
amazing saxophone solo performed by music 
master’s student Joseph Scheller.
They wrapped up the concert with Dizzy Gillespie’s 
“Manteca,” which had a nice Latin vibe, featuring 
solos from every section.
Overall, the concert was very diverse in terms of 
the jazz genres that were explored. You should 
deinitely go to their concerts next semester!

Authenticity and the new documentary Gimme Danger

Vetrimaaran leaned on the wall of the corridor 
leading into McConomy in a plain gray sweater 
over a powder-blue, button up oxford. He 
checked his phone, and smiled warmly as 
his Tamil-speaking fans asked for photos, 
while soon-to-be fans poured in to fill the 
auditorium. Outside, gobi manchurian (spiced 
cauliflower) and pakodas (fritters) were being 
served with chutney and water. 
The chattering of the audience induced an 
atmosphere of intrigue, as the kind-faced man 
who had greeted everyone stepped down to 
the front of the auditorium.
“This film is brutal,” he said, “I just want you 
all to keep that in mind while you’re watching.”
The Interrogation or Visaranai, directed by 
Vetrimaaran, premiered at the 72nd Venice 
Film Festival in September 2015, and 
took home the Amnesty International 
Italia Award. In February 2016, it 
premiered in India, and proved to be both a 
commercial and political success. 
On Nov. 18, the film was shown at Carnegie 
Mellon University’s International Film Festival, 
sponsored by the Asian Studies Center, 
The Tamil Nadu Foundation, and Pittsburgh 
Humanities Festival, and promoted by Amnesty 
International and the Indian Graduate Students 
Association.
The film is based off of a book titled Lock Up, 
written by M. Chandrakumar. The true story 
follows four young men who travel from Tamil 
Nadu to Andhra Pradesh in search of work, 
and find themselves becoming victims of 
what Vetrimaaran calls “the system.” The film 
explores themes of oppression, corruption, 
and injustice through the lens of police 
brutality and wrongful arrest in India.
Stunning visuals and an incredibly unique 
creative process earned the film the honor of 
being the official Indian submission for the 
Best Foreign Language Film for the upcoming 
89th Academy Awards. Vetrimaaran is now 
touring the nation, promoting the film and 
speaking to its brilliance.
What makes this film particularly unique is 
the way it was filmed. “We didn’t really have 
a script prepared,” Vetrimaaran chuckled. 
Before each shot, the director had a synopsis 
and general outline of the scene on hand and 
nothing more. “Filming this movie was an 
organic process,” he explained.
To further add to the atmosphere of the film, 
none of the actors knew their characters’ 
fate until the end of the film. “I wanted to 
film chronologically, and so the lead actor, 
Dinesh, said he wanted to learn the plot 
chronologically.” As a result, when the 
actors entered a 
courtroom, or prison 
scene, they never knew 
if they were going to 
make it out or survive.
In terms of the story and content, the film is 
difficult to stomach. Many scenes are packed 
with beating and screaming, and the film 
doesn’t hold back in terms of jarring visuals. “I 
made it a point to keep all of the deaths off-
screen,” Vetrimaaran said, “and I also do my 
best not to glorify the violence. I’m trying to 
send a message, not encourage indulgence.” 
As would be expected, filming such scenes 
took their toll on the actors and film crew. 
Vetrimaaran spoke of actors embracing each 
other in tears after filming certain sequences, 
and reflecting on the hardships of the real 
victims of police brutality in between shots. 
Dinesh, the lead actor who played the 
character Pandi, was particularly shaken, and 
felt privileged to be able to step away from 
the violence, while others couldn’t.
What makes the film particularly impactful 
is the purity of the main characters, and the 
contrasting ruthlessness of the policemen. 
There were a few redeeming characters who 
sought to aid the four men, but more often 
than not we saw betrayal and deceit reigning 
over mercy and compassion. 
Vetrimaaran even removed a tentative dream 
sequence where the boys were to kill the 
policemen, to further their image of purity. 
Pandi, holding a gun to an officer at the end of 
the film, even says when prompted to shoot, 
“But to kill to live, sir?”
Since its release, the film has sparked 
conversations around India, about “the 
system,” and about the effect it has on 
minority groups around the nation. The Chief 
Justice of Tamil Nadu has screened the film 
for magistrates to demonstrate 
issues with law 
enforcement, 
and the 
National Police 
Academy has invited 
Vetrimaaran to screen the film for its 
trainees.
The moderator for the Q&A session that 
was held after the movie emphasized that 
through the conflicted policemen and women 
in the film, the audience is encouraged to 
“cling to their own humanity,” and recall that 
we know such incidences happen every day, 
and that it is our duty to bring about social 
change.
“I wish to have a better place for a common 
man to live in, that’s what makes this all worth 
it, Vetrimaaran sighed, “but, I don’t think that 
day will ever come. If it does, I’ll be a happy 
man. Change is inevitable, but all films can 
really do is push people to want that change.”
Vetrimaaran’s masterpiece sparks intrigue at IFF

Gimme Danger is a new documentary from Jim 
Jarmusch, director of Only Lovers Left Alive (2013) 
and Coffee and Cigarettes (2003), currently in limited 
release across the country, being shown in Pittsburgh 
by Pittsburgh Filmmakers. The ilm is a retrospective on 
the band The Stooges.
Let’s talk.
I felt pretty bleak before going to see Gimme Danger. 
To be honest with you, I’m still loating in a surreal 
headspace. Two weeks ago, I was a news junkie, but 
now I’m having a pretty dificult time engaging with 
reality. On top of that, the evening I saw this ilm, the 
sky was grey, the thanks-to-daylight-savings darkness 
was already taking over, and the cold was making itself 
known.
Gimme Danger didn’t make me feel better. But it 
made me feel different, in a meaningful way. Jim 
Jarmusch’s ilm is a stage dive into the truest realms 
of creativity, authenticity, and insanity. I’m more than 
willing to go there for a while. In the ilm, Jarmusch 
describes the Stooges as the greatest rock ’n’ roll 
band ever, though their lead singer Iggy Pop denies 
genre on principle, preferring to “just be.” In the 
course of ive or six minutes, Gimme Danger describes 
a band who, in the course of a few years, released 
a few albums, performed loudly and 
sporadically, and imploded shortly 
after in a notably messy fashion. 
And then the opening titles 
appear.
It quickly becomes evident why Jarmusch is taken 
enough with Iggy and The Stooges that he felt 
compelled to make this ilm. They share the same 
sense of oddball humor, barely acknowledging that 
their work is so glaringly unconventional, driven 
purely and religiously to create art that is exciting and 
righteous to them. Gimme Danger is composed in 
such a way that you are often shaken by the images 
in front of you (hazes of intoxication, crowd suring, 
peanut butter), overlaid two or three times, lashing 
in breakneck montages to the cacophony of live 
recordings. There is hilarity, obnoxiousness, and 
reckless energy. It may be the ilmic equivalent of a 
Stooges concert.
Early in the ilm, Iggy Pop describes his basic 
songwriting skills with candor, contrasting his twenty-
ive-different-words-or-less approach with the lyrical 
prowess of Bob Dylan (“blah, blah, blah,” says Iggy). 
And it seems to me that Jarmusch aims for the same 
target with Gimme Danger, preferring to convey the 
ecstasy of artistic conception rather than communicate 
truth in a manner more complicated or overthought. 
The ilm observes the young band exploring and 
experimenting with all forms of noise, challenging 
ideas about where music can originate as well as what 
is acceptable in performance.
I’m struck in a large way by the zen of The 
Stooges. Granted, they were nuts, 
addled by drugs in starts and stops, 
faced off with violent exchanges 
mid-performance. But that’s 
all part of it. Creatively, they 
persevered when confronted with both indifference 
and outright hatred; and the way they persevered, 
with simple self-afirmation and sheer independence, 
is what is most inspiring. There’s almost a nonchalance 
in Iggy Pop, a conidence that they would not have 
existed any other way.
A memorable moment in the ilm comes when Iggy 
describes the appropriation of rock by corporate 
America — men in suits solving equations, birthing 
inauthentic white bread groups to create harmless 
sound that placated the masses and sold records. 
These numbers — men cobbled together bland half-
ideas and pretended that’s what the people wanted. 
This is the moment in the ilm that nailed down The 
Stooges’ importance for me.
Gimme Danger is a caffeinated, joyous middle inger 
to people in power demanding that you sit down 
and buy what they’re selling. It celebrates a group 
of midwestern kids who, through acts of simple, 
undaunted, artistic bravery, decided for themselves 
and generations to come that “cool” is what you want 
it to be. And, in a strange way, that’s downright life 
afirming.
I’m sad and angry today, and I will continue to be for 
awhile. But, let me tell you, when I was in the basement 
theater bathroom after the ilm, listening to two old 
guys ranting and criticizing our next 
president, I smiled. It felt 
pretty punk 
rock.

Izzy Sio | StaffwriterAn Open Letter to Marvel
Dear Marvel,
Congrats. Unsurprisingly, your new ilm, Doctor 
Strange, is great. I love this movie. I love its trippy art 
style, its classic Marvel humor, and its heart. You also 
somehow managed not to create a terribly-written 
villain (as you usually do), and your movie has already 
made over $500 million. Obviously, that’s a lot of 
money.
Oh, and I loved your actors, too. Well, most of them.
I thought your choice last year to cast Tilda Swinton 
as The Ancient One, a character known in the 
respected Marvel Comics to be an old male Tibetan 
monk, was interesting at irst, and it’s no surprise that 
Mrs. Swinton is a phenomenal actress. In fact, she 
was phenomenal in this very movie. But many people 
were angry, confused, and shocked. Tilda Swinton is 
as far from an old male Tibetan monk as you are from 
DC Comics.
Seven months ago you released a statement trying to 
defend yourself.
Here’s how I break it down to my friends: one, you 
threw money at yourselves. No surprise. Every 
business does that. Tilda Swinton scared me to death 
as the White Witch in The Chronicles of Narnia and is 
enormously talented.
Second, by essentially sweeping your problem of 
accidentally creating a racist stereotypical Ancient 
One and offending China under the rug, you’ve 
created a larger problem by playing into Hollywood 
whitewashing and making her Celtic rather than 
Tibetan. You have denied another role, another job 
opportunity, to Asian actors. This is not the irst time 
this has happened, and I am tired of feeling pushed 
to the side to seemingly appease your audience.
Third, and most importantly, you lied to me.
I see no “strong record of diversity” and “regular 
departure from stereotypes” when I see your ratio of 
three white Chris’s for every one black Nick Fury. For 
every female superhero there are two genius playboy 
billionaire philanthropists. When I look at cast photos 
from your previous movies, I often see two colors. I, 
an Asian-American teenage woman, can’t see myself, 
and I am part of one of your key demographics.
This was where my anger, confusion, and shock 
stemmed from, but I also felt hurt. Disappointed. 
Excluded. Grant Gustin, who plays the Flash on CW, 
said recently, “storytelling in general will remain an 
escape from every day life,” and I did not expect you, 
my lifeboat, to cast me off, especially now. I expected 
more and better, and now after watching the movie 
I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. Doctor 
Strange had quickly become one of my favorite 
Marvel movies, but I could not ignore the struggles, 
problems, and lies involved within its production. 
Additionally, all my fellow Marvel-loving friends have 
written this off, but myself and my Asian-American 
friends are still torn up about this. And this divide 
that’s been caused probably hurts me more.
Earlier this month, I felt torn, too. I felt hurt about 
America as a nation, and how we are devolving 
into a cycle of violence and hate with a completely 
new, stronger, and rawer sense of viciousness with a 
seemingly bleak view on how we can ind a solution. 
Right now, I’m ashamed of our country, and I feel that 
way towards you, too.
And right now, all I can think of is to ask, what 
happens now? What does this movie mean for our 
representation? How will representation form under 
Donald Trump’s presidency? Moreover, how does this 
presidency relect us as a nation? Your whitewashing 
has already dealt a major blow to diversity and 
visibility, according to Variety Magazine, because 
of its inevitable success. And with Trump, that blow 
might be a lot larger. But I refuse to be intimidated by 
our circumstances. If anything, these situations have 
motivated me to make a change.
I’ve already told people to go see this movie. In 
fact, I’ve already seen it twice. And I might watch it 
a third time as well. But when I tell people to watch 
this movie, I’m going to tell them about what has 
happened behind the scenes. I want people to watch 
this movie with a greater knowledge of Asian issues, 
and create a chain reaction of awareness.
I will acknowledge it: you possibly couldn’t have won 
anyone over with this character. If you created a racist 
Asian stereotype, that might have offended people 
even more. But instead you created a complex, 
substantive character that an Asian woman could 
have desperately beneited from. I just don’t want 
you to lie to me, or your millions of fans, again. I hope 
what has happened can help foster a discussion not 
just on your end, but everywhere else too.

As the semester reaches its final lap, with all the exams and essays piling on 
top of each other up to our eyeballs, it seems impossible to even think about 
taking time to relax, chat with friends, and enjoy a good meal. But sometimes, 
taking time for ourselves, away from campus, tests, and deadlines, is the best 
way to relieve all the stress that has been building up on us since the start of 
the semester. For me, great food with great friends is the perfect remedy. 
This is my first semester at Carnegie Mellon, and I’ve tried to explore Pittsburgh 
as much as I can. After visiting Oakland and Shadyside, Squirrel Hill was next 
on my list. This week I decided to go to Everyday Noodles in Squirrel Hill with 
a friend. As soon as we entered the restaurant I instantly knew I would have a 
good experience there. We were seated immediately, since we arrived early 
in the evening, before 6 p.m., but the place was already bustling with people 
relaxing after a long week. The interior of the restaurant is nice and laid back, 
the ideal spot for college students and families. Customers can watch the chefs 
make the noodles from scratch through a glass screen looking into the kitchen 
at the front of the restaurant. I was surprised to see the chefs making the noo-
dles by hand in the Chinese style because it’s something I haven’t seen in many 
Chinese restaurants outside of China or a Chinatown.
 
The menu itself is extensive, ranging from a variety of noodle choices, to dim 
sum, to several rice dishes. It took me a while to choose what I wanted, but I 
finally settled on a classic Chinese dish — braised beef and tendon noodle soup 
— while my friend selected the hot spicy wonton noodles and an order of pork soup dumplings for us to 
split. Instead of a waiter asking for our order, the restaurant provides paper menus and pencils at the 
tables so customers can check off everything they’d like to order. When the waiter came to pick up our 
menus, he simply asked which type of noodles we preferred (thin or wide). This was a new style of order-
ing that I hadn’t experienced before, but it felt right with the casual but chic style of the restaurant.
 
The food came very quickly, with barely a wait at all. The moment the beef noodle soup was placed in 
front of me, I could smell the familiar aromas of beef and spices. It was phenomenal, with exquisitely ten-
der beef and tendon, steamed broccoli, and handmade noodles. The dish immediately took me back to 
Shanghai, where I ate my first authentic Chinese beef noodle soup. It was quite spicy, just the way I like 
it. If you aren’t partial to spicy food, be sure to ask your waiter for a mildly spiced dish. My friend and I 
shared dishes, and her wonton noodles were just as delicious, with the hot chili oil flavoring the noodles 
in the best way. The pork soup dumplings were also a great addition to the meal, with soy sauce and 
thinly sliced ginger complementing the dish. This was my first time eating soup dumplings, and they left a 
great impression. The pork was mildly seasoned, allowing for the soy sauce and ginger to enhance the 
dumplings. By the end of the meal, I was completely stuffed and satisfied.
 
Of all the places I’ve visited in Pittsburgh so far, Everyday Noodles is definitely at the top. The service 
was efficient, but not overbearing, the restaurant atmosphere very welcoming, and the food itself spec-
tacular. It had some of the most authentic Chinese dishes I’ve had in a restaurant in America. This was 
the perfect way for me to relax after a week of endless assignments and to catch up with my friend. The 
place was busy, but not overcrowded, which allowed us to feel comfortable. I’m excited to go back with 
more friends and try different dishes. I would highly recommend Everyday Noodles to anyone — the 
menu has something for everyone, including vegetarian choices, desserts, and bubble tea. Plus, it’s very 
close to campus — just a short ten-minute bus ride away. I will definitely bring my family to eat there the 
next time they are in Pittsburgh.EVERYDAY

Put me in a box
Wrapped with a pretty little bow
Tell me who I am 
Because I sure as hell don’t know,
Tell me why I should stay 
Live on this melancholy Earth
Tell me why I should listen
And what your words are worth.
So put me in a box,
Make it pretty, wrap it tight. 
Tell me that I’m normal 
That I should be quite alright.
Put a ribbon on me 
Let the sunlight catch my skin
Tell me I’m a child of God
And cover up my sin.
Try to make me normal 
Try to hide my darkened soul
Make me a perfect image
Say my heart is made of gold.
We both know what you’re trying to do
We know you won’t succeed
Because under all of your trying
Is a monster you need to feed.
You want to explain yourself
Try to talk to me
Say you’re sorry
You’re not sorry
Say your empty words
I’ll listen, don’t worry
Only because I’ll think it’s funny
And I need a laugh, these days.
