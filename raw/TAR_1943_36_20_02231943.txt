Out of the almost 600 who signed up, 489 persons donated their blood last week 
when the Red Cross mobile unit was on the campus. A number of people were turned 
down either because they were under 18 or because they had colds. What the students 
lost in blood, they more than made up for in milk and sandwiches—on the house!

Tech Meets W.& J. Here 
Wednesday; Defeated 
By Westminster, 56-42
By Asher Etkes
Blood seemed to be the theme on our 
cajnpus this past week, and it seems to 
have scored a direct hit on that uncon­
trollable up and down curve called by 
most “Dame Fortune.” Too much loss of 
that “stuff” brought that curve to a hew 
low as our ball tossers from Skibo Gym 
ventured into the “woods” three times 
during five days and each time crawled 
back with their heads bowed low.
As any mathematician “kin” tell you 
(I hope) a curve usually goes up after 
hitting bottom. We hope that this will 
apply to the “Hungry” Tartans when 
they tackle the district’s top team in the 
presidents from W. & J. at the Men’s 
Gym tomorrow, Wednesday at 8:30. Hav­
ing lost to them by a “mere” 40 points 
in their last tussle, the Hannum men are 
ready and willing to go to extremes in 
bringing home a victory against the 
giants from “little” Washington.
After beating Allegheny, at the same 
time inflicting it’s lone defeat upon the 
latter, Tech dropped a “close” one to the 
Bearcats from St. Vincent on that event­
ful Junior Prom night. Carrying a sour 
taste from that game into the all import­
ant Pitt fray, our boys got off on the 
wrong foot and let the Panthers sport a 
7 point lead by the first quarter. The 
Sklbos, never underfought, outplayed the 
boys from the other side of the bridge at 
this point and brought the score to 34-32 
as Frank Showman, our sturdy guard, 
swished two one handers in a row. But 
ste&dy playing by the Cats and “freak” 
shots by Co-Captain Bob Artman of the 
Carlson men kept our shooters at the 
gate with the latter shut. These plus, 
made the final score read 55-43 with ouf 
boys on the short end of that “long” 
count.
Tech then traveled to Beaver Falls to 
engage Geneva’s “undefeated team at 
their home floor,” and proceeded to es­
tablish this fact more firmly as they 
dropped a close game by a 53-48 score. 
Spotting the “Gin”eva men a 12-0 lead in 
the early stage the Tarans fought back 
and left for their dressing room at half 
time leading 24-20. They came back, 
were tied at 46 all with a few minutes left 
and then watched three of their top scor­
ers Brinn, Culbertson, and Hugh Smith 
leave the floor successively with 4 per­
sonal fouls. This shock did the trick and 
Geneva went in front to stay.
Saturday night Tech faced another one 
of those unstoppable home teams, the 
Titans of Westminster. Tired from the 
long trip and with lack of practice (men’s 
Gym closed this week) the Tartans were 
no match for Goldblum, O’Hara and Co. 
The fast pace was too much for the 
weary Tartans. After leading 14-9 at 
the quarter they lost the lead and never 
caught up.
Freshman Girls-Boys 
Attend Assemblies
Continuing with the second in the se­
ries on “Personal Health,” the R.O.T.C. 
Department will show a film to all fresh­
men boys in the Little Theater at 11:30 
today. Although attendance is compul­
sory for R.O.T.C. freshmen, it is strongly 
recommended that all other freshmen 
boys also attend. Those who saw the 
first of the series last fall will recall that 
it was both interesting and educational.
At the same time today, Dr. Charles 
Watkins, Director of the Margaret Mor­
rison Carnegie College, will speak to the 
freshman girls of that school in the Mar­
garet Morrison Assembly Hall. His talk 
will be a discussion of the various de­
partments open to the girls soon to enter 
their sophomore year, as they cannot 
choose a particular department for their 
course of study until that time. Dr. 
Watkins will particularly stress those 
secretarial and science courses vital to 
the war effort.
Sing and Swing Entries 
To Be In By March 17
Plans are rapidly being completed to 
provide a bigger and better Greek Sing 
and Swing than ever before. This year’s 
program is unique in that the contest will 
be on Friday night, March 26, and the 
dance will be the following Saturday, at 
which time the winners will be announced 
and will sing.
The competition this year will be be­
tween groups of various sizes instead of 
individual members of fraternities, so­
rorities, and similar organizations. Cups 
will be offered to the best quartet, the 
winners of the five to twelve persons 
group, and the winners of the group of 
over fifteen contestants. All organiza­
tions may enter two of the three events, 
and the same contestant may compete 
twice. Competition is open to both men’s 
and women’s dorms, fraternities, sorori­
ties, and other organized groups on the 
campus except those having special music 
training.
The entrance fee is undecided, but it 
will probably be a flat rat of three dollars 
per team. Judges will be selected from 
laymen interested in music. All entries 
are due March 17 at the Student Council 
Office by 5 o’clock. Jim Boyce will re­
ceive entries. The entrance rules will 
be sent to all organizations.
Math Club To Present 
Movies and Lecture
The C.I.T. Undergraduate Mathematics 
Club will hold its fifth meeting of the 
current year this Friday, at 3:30 P, M. in 
Room 104, Industries Hall. Professor E. 
A. Whitman of the department of Math­
ematics will speak on “Mathematics— 
Moving Pictures Relating to Mathe­
matics.” All students and faculty mem­
bers who are interested are cordially in­
vited to attend the meeting.
Moving pictures relating to mathe- 
ematics are not nearly so numerous as in 
many other educational subjects, but there 
are films relating to some of the specific 
parts of college mathematics. At this 
meeting several such films will be shown 
including the film “A Triple Integral,” 
which was produced under the direction 
of Professor Whitman. The films to be 
screened have been chosen to show ex­
amples of studio made films with sound, 
teacher made films, and animated pictures.
Can you imagine your Math Proff as a 
dynamic movie star? Oh! no, well come 
and see.
Students Are Invited 
To Attend SAI Music 
Program Tomorrow
Wednesday at 8:30 the Alpha Nu chap­
ter of Sigma Alpha Iota will present a

Red Cross Starts 
Nickel A Day Plan
In order to aid the Red Cross, whose 
quota this year is doubled, the students 
of Carnegie Tech will support them in 
their annual campaign by having a ten- 
day drive on campus, beginning March 1. 
To make it more convenient for the stu­
dents to contribute, they will be able to 
donate a nickel a day for ten days.
The doubling of the Red Cross quota is 
very justified, since their job this year is 
twice as big as it was last year. Any dis­
aster anywhere immediately receives at­
tention from the Red Cross, which aids 
the victims of the catastrophe with food, 
clothing, and medical supplies. Every­
where our soldiers go, the Red Cross is 
close behind them—carrying stretchers, 
running ambulance services, and main­
taining hospitals. As Allied lines keep 
extending, so the expenditures of the 
Red Cross increase.
The responsibility for the Drive has 
been divided between the Interfraternity 
Council who will approach the fraterni­
ties for their donations; the Dorm Coun­
cils who will take charge of donations by 
dorm students; Intersorority Council who 
will be in charge of Sorority donations; 
the Citcom Clan who in turn will ap­
proach its members for donations; and 
a campus-wide drive under the joint aus­
pices of the Cwens, Mortar Board, Delta 
Skull, O.D.K., and Scimitars who will ap­
proach the student body in its favorite 
haunts. These honoraries will cover the 
Beanery, Grill, Skibo, and the main hall 
of all of the buildings.
If every student gives five cents for 
ten days, our campus will be able to 
raise close to $900. Last year Techites 
raised the miserable grand total of $60.
What etfa, Scoii!
Dollars For Pennies 
And You Can’t Lose
If you were to count the pennies mint­
ed by the U. S. Government last year at 
the rate of one a second without taking 
time out to sleep, swear, or eat a T-bone 
steak, it would take you more than 45 
years and seven months! The 8,000,000 
pounds of copper that was made into pen­
nies last year is enough to make 1,250,000 
shells for 155 mm. Howitzers.
The Treasury Dept, plans to cut down 
on penny production this year. This 
means that we must keep all of our pen­
nies in circulation. That is why the 
SWAC is sponsoring a penny drive start­
ing the week of March 2. At convenient­
ly located booths in Industries, Margaret 
Morrison, and the Beanery all victory 
conscious students will be able to EX­
CHANGE their penny collections for crisp 
new bills and shining quarters.
The penny drive is not a new idea 
among Pittsburgh colleges. A successful 
drive was started at the University of 
Pittsburgh by Professor Amos. Three 
hundred thousand coppers were with­
drawn from their hiding places in piggy 
banks and cigar boxes and were put into 
circulation. Professor Amos suggested the 
idea to Dr. Chorowsky of the C.I.T. War 
Committee who immediately set the 
wheels in motion. A SWAC committee 
headed by John Ornea was organized to 
inform students of the plan and to con­
duct the campaign.
This is a special appeal to all you thrifty 
Skibos who are saving pennies to bring 
your home-town girl in for Spring Car­
nival or to buy that tennis racket you saw 
in Kaufmann’s window. We aren’t going 
to let those Pitt students overshadow us 
Scotchmen in a matter like this—are we? 
Remember, we don’t want contributions; 
just turn in your copper for silver.

2THE CÁRNE6IE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1943
editori A'uncUain.... Council Minutes ...
A Crucial Problem
The following letter was received this week and presents a problem which, we 
think, should be dealt with immediately. This matter has been kept in the dark by 
the administration as it should be if the problem had disappeared with the first or 
second case. However, the alarming increase of similar incidents calls for bold and
decisive action.
Dear Mr. Editor:
There are over 500 women on this campus. A large number of these either 
take evening courses, or have gone out for extra curricular activities that 
require them to be on campus at night. Many are students in the Drama De­
partment, and because of crew, rehearsals and the like, must of necessity walk 
back to their dorms and homes after dark.
During the past three weeks there have been at least eight cases reported 
of girls being accosted, while walking home or to the dorms, by undesirable 
characters. The streets and back paths are desolate so that anyone walking 
alone travels entirely “at her own risk.”
It has been suggested that girls walk only in pairs, but too frequently this 
is impossible due to the fact that one can not always find someone going in her 
direction. As a result of these outlandish incidents, the girls of Tech have 
been thrown into a near state of panic.
Something must be done about this situation. This is a college and as 
such should at least offer protection to its students. As things stand, this 
campus is a menace to its female students. The first floor rooms of Forbes 
Hall are flush with the ground and offer a tempting entrance to any passer­
by, tramp or otherwise. Such occurences are not merely possibilities, but 
actual fact. Whether these assaults be verbal or otherwise, is there any reason 
to make nervous wrecks of girls by subjecting them to such treatment?
I realize that, during the present crisis, it is impossible to secure adequate 
police protection for the campus. But kindly tell me where the night watch­
men, who are supposed to guard the campus, disappear to at the crucial mo­
ment. True, two of the offenders have been caught in the Fine Arts Building 
and turned over to the authorities, only to be released after spending a night 
or two in jail. Don’t you think that somthing vital should be done to improve 
this appalling condition? L. J. S.

“On the Campus” is conducted for the 
benefit of the entire Tech student body.

Free Tea For the Girls!
The Cwens, popular young Sophomore 
honorary females, are sponsoring a ser­
ies of teas; the first one today the 23rd, the 
second Thursday the 25th, the third Fri­
day the 26th, and the last one, March the 
4th. All freshie gals are invited for the 
purpose of getting acquainted with the

formula that enables them to be intelli­
gent and active. So come on gals and 
meet the “Cwens with the brains.”
Last Chance To Be a Sailor 
Special Bulletin! Our Tartan reporters 
in the Military Department have stopped 
their sabotage long enough to notify us 
that V-l enlistments will be terminated 
by MARCH 15. All boys still UNDER 18 
should see Mr. Wangeman in the Place­
ments Office immediately if they are still 
interested in the Naval Reserve.
Senior Woman’s Honorary To Hold Party 
On Wednesday, March 3. Mortar Board, 
senior women’s honorary, will sponsor its 
annual Smarty Party in the Carnegie 
Union from 4:30 to 6:00. There will be
forty guests at the tea, the ten girls from 
each class in both Fine Arts and Mar­
garet Morrison who are highest on the 
honor roll. Ginny Wright will play the 
piano, and Barbara Burns and Doris 
Bloomberg will furnish entertainment. 
International Relations Club Meets 
I. R. C. will hold a special business 
meeting today, 12:30 in Room 112 of 
Maggie Murph. All members are urged 
to make a point of being there. Remem­
ber, this is your business!
Mortar Board Expands Stamp Booths!
War Stamps will be placed on sale at 
four new central locations: The Beanery, 
Arts building, the Grill, and Maggie 
Murph. Under the SWAC program, Mor­
tar Board has seen fit to sponsor this im­
provement and will man (?) their posts 
beginning today.
To Faculty Members, Carnegie 
Institute of Technology 
The War Adaptations Committee of the 
Social Relations Program has asked Pro­
fessor Gregg to present the topic for the 
second informal group discussion of is­
sues relating to war and postwar prob­
lems. He will discuss “The Strength and 
Weakness of Japan.” The meeting will 
be held in Room 234-A, I. H., at 3:30 P. 
M., Thursday, February 25.

She moved that the following motion be 
approved: The following social affairs
shall be considered as traditional on the 
Tech Campus, and that inasmuch as these 
social affairs have been sponsored and 
promoted by specific organizations in the 
past, these organizations shall therefore 
have the first opportunity to accept the 
responsibility of the promotion of the be­
low mentioned social affairs. If the or­
ganization to which the affair has been 
traditionally granted does not choose to 
sponsor it, the affair shall then be open 
for petition from any other recognized 
organizations on the Tech Campus, with 
the exception of Sing and Swing for the 
present semester, which has been granted 
by petition to Interfraternity Council for
the spring of 1943 and thereafter returned

Defeated By Langley
Case successfully invaded the Tartan 
swimming pool Saturday afternoon and 
carried off the meet with a total of 46 
points to 29 for Tech. The junior varsity 
came out on the short end of a 44 to 27 
score in their meet with Langley High. 
The meet opened with Roberts, Carle- 
ton, and Britton of Case opposing Sa­
rosdy, Ferguson, and Spangler in the 300- 
yard medley relay. The visitors took the 
race with the slow time of 3:25.2 Gund- 
lack and Parsons grabbed first and third 
for Case in the 220-yard freestyle while 
Taber and Donahue took second and 
fourth respectively. The time was 2:41. 
Case won the 50-yard dash in 25.4 as Por­
ter took first while Venzer and Spangler 
of Tech came in second and third. The 
score at this point was 16-7 in favor of 
the visitors.
Dependable Smith scored his usual five 
points for the Skibos in the fancy diving 
contest and his teammate Taylor picked 
up another for third in his first perform­
ance with the varsity. Porter of Case 
won the 100-yard freestyle in the very 
good time of 55.5 as Britton and Venzer 
finished second and third. Carnegie won 
another first place when Sarosdy and 
Berkowitz took first and third in the 
150-yard backstroke with a time of 2:00.6. 
Roberts of Case finished second. Fergu­
son of Tech won the 200-yard breast­
stroke in 2:48 and Carleton and Cramp- 
ton were second and third for the Cleve­
landers. Gundlack of Case took his sec-
just for fun. They took it too in 4:05.6 
with a team of Erdman, Britton, Carleton 
and Porter. Taber, Spangler, Venzer, 
and Beal swam for Carnegie in this final 
event. The Tech team was handicapped 
throughout the meet by the loss of three 
of its best men due to illness. Lee, who 
was top man for Tech in the two meets 
he was in, is probably out for the sea­
son with a bad sinus infection. Eyman 
and Galbraith, Tech’s best in the back­
stroke and freestyle distance, were out 
with more temporary ailments. It is 
hoped that they will be back for the 
telegraph meet with Virginia Polytech­
nic today or at least by next Saturday 
when the team meets Western Reserve in 
a return engagement.
The telegraph meet will be an unusual 
event in that the teams will be so far 
apart. Each will swim in its own pool 
against a stopwatch and the results will 
be sent to the opponent. The Tech swim­
mers were nearer victory when they 
swam against Western Reserve a few 
weeks ago than at any other time this 
season. The score was 39 to 36 in the 
Cleveland pool and the boys think that 
they can do better at home. The meet 
will start at 2:30 next Saturday. The 
junior varsity swims Schenley High at 
the same time and they also hope for 
better luck. Last week they won only 
three events; Fleck took the 50-yard free­
style, Gibian won the 100-yard breast­
stroke, and the winning medley relay 
team was composed of Fleck, Gibian and 
Sarosdy.
Virtually clinching League II cham­
pionship and a crack at the finals, Delta 
Tau Delta fraternity “humbled” a sup­
posedly strong Citcom “A” team in the 
“much talked about” bowling match, last 
Saturday at the University Bowling Al­
leys down on Craig Street.
Four other matches were scheduled and 
played, but most attention was focused on 
this specific match. It brought together 
Tech’s two strongest teams. A rousing 
battle was expected. What resulted turn­
ed out to be an anti-climax. Pins flew 
in all directions as expert bowling by 
the fraternity men proved too much to 
the “A” card holders. The Wilkinsburg 
cousins, Merle and John Wolff, turned 
out to be the “clutch” players of the day 
as they turned in 150 and 145 averages 
respectively for a well spent day. Merle,

Insignia Awards 
Are Within Reach
There is a little gremlin who looks 
after all good little workers. Yes! There 
is a shining light, a beacon that will 
guide you to your reward, an insignia. 
Though those points have not been accu­
mulating as rapidly as in the past, do not 
fret, you will receive an insignia. Stu­
dent Council will see to that.
In the past, when a worker had amass­
ed an excess of 30 points, an insignia was 
given him showing Council’s appreciation 
of his participation in. extra-curricular 
activities. Being a worker, you may find 
that you lack the required number of 
points even after the two scheduled par­
ties and dance have come and gone, but 
do not despair, faith will intervene.
After considerable discussion, Council 
has lowered the required number of points 
necessary for an insignia. If you are a 
conscientious worker, Council knows it. 
Based on the social chairman’s recom­
mendation you will receive an insignia, 
if it is evident that a determined effort 
has been made, even though you do not 
have the capacity in points.
Workers—show your spirit and Coun­
cil will not forsake you!

Union Mar. 20th
Saturday, March 20 Evening School 
goes all out ror dear old “Erin” with an­
other momentous party—this time in 
honor of St. Patrick! Remember the Val­
entine Party (?) Its worthy attractions 
were only meager samples of the type of 
entertainment in store for C. I. T.’s party 
goers.
This St. Patrick’s day party will be held 
at the Carnegie Union from 8:00 to 12:00 
P. M. As with the last party, there will 
be “juke box” dancing, ping-pong, cards, 
roulette (which incidentally seems to be 
quite popular), and, not to be ignored— 
refreshments!
In addition there will be activities dis­
tinctively designed for the particular oc­
casion—and there may be a multitude of 
prizes, who knows?
Evening students and their friends may 
attend this party for a small fee (to be 
announced later). Of particular appeal 
are the friendly associations arising 
from party socials as compared with 
dances where groups tend to be more 
restricted.
