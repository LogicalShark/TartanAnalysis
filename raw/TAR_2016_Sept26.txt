Mortar Board’s Eta chapter 
at Carnegie Mellon Universi-
ty was presented the Golden 
Torch award at the National 
Mortar Board Conference in 
Indianapolis, Ind. over the 
past summer. The Golden 
Torch is awarded annually 
at the National Mortar Board 
Conference to the most out-
standing chapters of Mortar 
Board across the nation.
Mortar Board is a senior 
honor society ?rst founded in 
1912 at The Ohio State Uni-
versity, Swarthmore College, 
and the University of Chi-
cago. Carnegie Mellon’s Eta 
chapter was founded in 1923, 
at the then Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. A select few 
rising senior students among 
all disciplines are invited to 
join Mortar Board each year 
based on their leadership, 
academic excellence, and 
dedication to service. The 
Mortar Board plays an ac-
tive role in both the Carnegie 
Mellon community as well 
as the Pittsburgh community 
through several annual 
events on campus, such as 
Staff Appreciation Day which 
is dedicated to recognize 
the staff members who are 
working behind the scenes 
at Carnegie Mellon. Through 
Mortar Board advisor Sha-
ron Craver, who is also the 
principal of The Children’s 
School at Carnegie Mellon, 
Mortar Board scholars work 
closely with children and 
provide educational weekend 
events for students.
Joshua Zak ’17, a Science 
and Humanities Scholar 
studying chemistry, is cur-
rently serving as the president 
of Carnegie Mellon Mortar 
Board. Zak was invited to join 
the Carnegie Mellon Mortar 
Board last spring. In July, 
he represented the Carnegie 
Mellon chapter at the annual 
National Mortar Board Con-
ference at Indianapolis, Ind.

The day-to-day activities of 
a typical Carnegie Mellon stu-
dent involve interacting with 
many different people. This 
ranges from our classmates 
to our friends and profes-
sors. Also serving an integral 
part in the everyday lives of 
Carnegie Mellon students are 
the CulinArt employees who 
provide us with our food and 
beverages (coffee for many) 
to help us get through the 
day. The CulinArt employees 
play an important role in the 
inner workings and success of 
the Carnegie Mellon commu-
nity, but how well have their 
paychecks re?ected this?
Many of the CulinArt em-
ployees at Carnegie Mellon 
have engaged in a long and 
arduous struggle to acquire 
decent payment. Their ?ght 
to be heard ?nally came to 
fruition on Sept. 23 when, 
in a 44–3 decision, workers 
voted to enact a new con-
tract that would gradually in-
crease their wages to be over 
$16.75 during the next four 
years. $16.75 is a massive 
leap for Production 1 workers 
(those who provide us with 
our food), who now make 
up to only $13.35 an hour. 
Many workers make even less 
than this.
$13.35 is not nearly enough 
money for workers to make a 
decent living, especially with 
the responsibility of taking 
care of their families. Not only 
were workers desperate for 
change, but they were also 
fueled by the knowledge that 
they were being drastically 
underpaid when compared 
to Production 1 workers at 
the University of Pittsburgh 
(Sodexo) and Duquesne 
University (Parkhurst).
Compared to the $13.35 
CulinArt workers currently 
make, Sodexo workers make 
up to $15.92 and Parkhurst 
workers make up to $15.65. 
This new contract will not 
just close the wage gap be-
tween CulinArt, Sodexo, and 
Parkhurst workers, but will 
also place CulinArt workers 
ahead of the other two.
The Tartan spoke with 
Takeisha Johnson and Er-
icka Coleman, two CulinArt 
employees, to get their per-
spectives on the challenges 
they face with being under-
paid and how this new con-
tract will positively impact 
their lives.
Coleman, who has been 
a CulinArt employee for two 
and a half years, can be seen 
at Rothberg’s Roasters II in 
Scott Hall. Every Sunday 
through Thursday, she wakes 
up at 5 a.m. to tend to her 
13-year-old and 20-month-
old daughters and 5-year-old 
son before she gets ready for 
her 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. shift.
Johnson, who has been a 
CulinArt employee for eight 
years, can be seen at the 
Downtown Deli of the Cohon 
Center. She wakes up at 5:50 
a.m. to help her 17-year-old 
daughter and 15-year-old son 
get ready for school before 
she arrives at 8:30 a.m. to 
start gathering the food for 
her 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift at 
the deli.
Coleman and Johnson love 
interacting with the Carn-
egie Mellon students that visit 
their dining areas, and love 
when students thank them 
and acknowledge their ser-
vice. However, sometimes the 
struggle to acquire enough 
money to live a comfortable 
life can take its toll. “Every-
day people ask me ‘Hi Er-
icka, how are you?’ and my 
response is I am overworked 
and underpaid,” Coleman 
said. She initially made $9.50 
during her ?rst three years as 
a CulinArt employee before 
receiving a gradual raise to 
$12.02, which she believes 
just wasn’t enough.
Service Employees 
International Union (SEIU) 
32BJ represents the approxi-
mately 80 full time Culin-
Art workers. Ryan Terrell, 
SEIU’s Lead Representative, 
noted the wall of separation 
and inequality that can ex-
ist between CulinArt workers 
and much of the rest of the 
Carnegie Mellon community. 
“On a campus like this where 
there is so much wealth, for 
inequality to happen here is 
really shocking. I think people 
should be aware of it.” Terrell 
said. “The people that provide 
service here are not robots, 
they are people with families, 
children, and dreams.” He 
further states, “In the same 
way the students come here 
with hopes and aspirations, 
there is also the idea that 
the people working here also 
have hopes and aspirations.”
After Friday’s decision, 
Johnson expressed that she 
was excited that this wage 
increase will help her to sup-
port her family and will al-
low her to achieve the goals 
she has set for her children. 
She points out that she has a 
daughter who is currently a 
senior in high school and the 
extra money she will be ac-
quiring will help her daughter 
make a successful transition 
to college. This additional 
money will also allow her to 
save enough money to pursue 
her own dreams.
Coleman and Johnson 
praise the professors at Carn-
egie Mellon who are always 
open to listening about their 
struggles and even take the 
time out to try and help. 
Gina Stanton, a Production 
2 cook at Resnik, applauded 
the Carnegie Mellon students 
and professors who were an 
instrumental part in this new 
contract being negotiated. It 
was the collaboration of these 
individuals, the CulinArt 
workers, and the SEIU team 
that allowed the 80 full time 
CulinArt workers to receive 
this new contract, which will 
allow them to support their 
families, live more comfort-
able lives, and give back to the 
Pittsburgh community.
SEIU currently doesn’t 
represent the other approxi-
mately 40 part-time Culin-
Art workers, but is seeking 
to change this and bargain 
a contract that will support 
them as well.

Braddock Mayor John 
Fetterman held a reception 
on Sept. 19 at his home to 
raise funds for the Demo-
cratic candidate for Penn-
sylvania Attorney General, 
Josh Shapiro. If appointed 
as Attorney General, Shap-
iro will represent the state 
in legal proceedings and 
will act as an advocate for 
the public, according to 
the National Association of 
Attorney Generals.
Shapiro spoke to 
approximately 50 adults, 
outlining his plans for pro-
moting minority rights and 
reducing incarceration. Re-
garding policies relevant to 
college students, he said, “I 
am going to be doing every-
thing I can to help students 
in dealing with campus sex-
ual assault, which is a huge 
problem on campuses, and 
[will help] students deal 
with fraud against them by 
student loan companies.”
Shapiro said he will 
ensure that when some-
one makes a report to an 
of?cial, such as a Resident 
Assistant or an administra-
tor, the of?cial knows who 
this information needs to 
be reported to, thus creat-
ing a reporting chain. He 
plans to do this by requir-
ing all such leaders to sign 
an agreement con?rming 
that they “understand what 
their responsibilities are.” 
Shapiro has also promised 
to eliminate the backlog of 
over 1,800 evidence kits in 
Pennsylvania by process-
ing the evidence in sexual 
assault cases.
In addition, Shapiro 
mentioned the illicit col-
lection of student debt as 
a problem since many debt 
collection agencies deceive 
students so that they pay 
more than they actually 
owe on their student loans. 
On his campaign website, 
he vows to “protect Penn-
sylvanians with student 
loan debt by cracking down 
on the predatory lenders 
and collection agencies 
that try to take advantage 
of them.”
Shapiro also urged 
students to communicate 
with political leaders like 
him, whether it be through 
email, Snapchat, or Face-
book. “I do things that are 
helpful to students when I 
hear from them. But they 
have to be engaged in the 
process, certainly in the 
political process, and ul-
timately in the governing 
process as well,” he said.
While many students 
are disappointed with 
how politicians often fail 
to govern effectively, Sha-
piro encouraged them to 
nevertheless advocate for

Out of the millions of Uber 
customers out there, only two 
can say that they were the 
?rst riders in an Uber self-
driving car, and it happened 
here in Pittsburgh.
On Sept. 14, Carnegie 
Mellon President Subra 
Suresh and Pittsburgh Mayor 
Bill Peduto shared a ride in 
the ?rst of?cial self-driving 
Uber. They were picked up 
at City Hall with two Carn-
egie Mellon alumni, Uber test 
operations manager Peter 
Castelli (CIT, Mechanichal 
Engineering ‘03) and Uber 
vehicle operator David Power 
(CFA, Industrial Design ‘16), 
who made sure the ride went 
smoothly in the front seat. 
After driving around Oak-
land, Suresh and Peduto were 
dropped off at the University. 
This marks the company’s un-
veiling of this technology and 
their promotion of its accessi-
bility to the public.
Not only is it signi?cant 
for the University that Presi-
dent Suresh got to repre-
sent the school at this tech-
nological milestone, but 
Carnegie Mellon’s role in 
autonomous vehicle (AV) 
technology is also what 
makes this ride so important 
for the academic community.
“Universities like Carnegie 
Mellon have the power to 
change the world. This dem-
onstration is a very good ex-
ample of that,” Suresh said 
in a university press release. 
“This is why innovation is so 
closely connected to research 
universities. For several de-
cades, Carnegie Mellon has 
pioneered the technology be-
hind autonomous vehicles.”
According to the school’s 
College of Engineering web-
site, for the past 30 years, 
Carnegie Mellon has been at 
the forefront of the AV ?eld. In 
1984, Carnegie Mellon made 
the ?rst autonomous vehicle, 
the Terregator, that could 
only travel a couple centime-
ters per second. Since then, 
Carnegie Mellon has made 
140 invention disclosures for 
AV technologies.
“The college has developed 
a tremendous body of work 
during the past 30 years in 
the area of self-driving tech-
nology, and we will continue 
our efforts in shaping the 
future of transportation,” 
dean of the College of En-
gineering James Garrett 
said in an interview for the 
Engineering magazine.
As this ?eld advances, 
more updates will be added 
to auto production. For 
example, parking assistance 
and adaptive cruise con-
trol are now in commercial 
vehicles.
“Features of automated 
self-driving cars will appear 
incrementally and organi-
cally, with vehicles eventu-
ally driving themselves. This 
will make the cars afford-
able and encourage public 
adoption,” Professor Raj 
Rajkumar of electrical and

Carnegie Mellon’s 
statistics students had the 
unique opportunity to ex-
plore the connections be-
tween sports and statistics 
earlier this month with a 
little help from the Pitts-
burgh Pirates. Recently, pro-
fessional teams have become 
more interested in collecting 
data about players’ strengths 
and weaknesses to identify a 
possible edge. This is where 
statistics comes into play.
Undergraduate statistics 
majors from the Dietrich 
College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences along-
side members of the Tar-
tan Sports Analytics Club 
(TSAC) were able to meet 
with the Pirates’ analytics 
team before the game. Stu-
dents got to ask a variety 
of questions to the team’s 
data architect, Josh Smith, 
quantitative analyst, Mike 
Fitzgerald, and director 
of baseball informatics, 
Dan Fox.
Many TSAC members 
have had the chance to 
intern or work for profes-
sional sports teams includ-
ing the Pirates and teams in 
the NFL and NBA. Faculty 
advisor of TSAC and visit-
ing assistant professor in 
the statistics department, 
Sam Ventura, works as an 
analytics consultants for the 
Pittsburgh Penguins.

DOMINIQUE ESCANDON
Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabinet Writer 
of The Student Government. 
Dressed in our very best 
out?ts for exploring and talk-
ing about our feelings, be that 
overalls (Srishti Jain, Sexual 
Assault and Relationship Vio-
lence Prevention Advocate) or 
an explorer hat-and-vest com-
bo (Aaron Gutierrez, Student 
Body Vice President), eleven 
members of the President’s 
Cabinet made the winding 
trek to North Park for a Cabi-
net retreat. The mood shifted 
to re?ective when Vaasavi 
Unnava, Student Body 
President, asked us to take 
a few minutes to write a re-
sponse to the question, “What 
do you want CMU to be like?”
That’s a tough one. It was, 
of course, my active choice 
to enroll in Carnegie Mel-
lon almost a year and a half 
ago, but every day since then 
my understanding of what it 
means to be a student here 
has been challenged and 
changed, not into something 
permanently ugly, but de?-
nitely something complicated.
The sentiment was shared. 
Frustrations toward a lack of 
inter-grade interactions or 
communal spaces to just relax 
or share conversation are 
routed in the belief that ev-
ery student here is interesting 
and worth getting to know. A 
desire for more female profes-
sors — voiced by Olivia Roy, 
our chief of staff and a se-
nior majoring in mechanical 
engineering, who has never 
been taught engineering by 
a woman —- stems from the 
knowledge that Carnegie Mel-
lon attracts incredible talent 
and our faculty has a signi?-
cant impact on our lives. The 
fact that many students view 
their Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity experience as transac-
tion-based, putting up what 
they need for an expected 
professional gain, means that 
we trust that this institution 
facilitates success based 
on effort.
But what about imposter 
syndrome, the belief that ev-
eryone around you is a genius 
and you are the only one who 
is struggling, which runs ram-
pant through our individual-
ly-able and always-imperfect 
student body? The name of 
Carnegie Mellon, the motto 
of putting your all in the work 
(with work placed under a 
strict de?nition of academics), 
means you have something to 
prove, but it’s driving us past 
our limits. How can we make 
students more comfortable 
speaking about how they are 
doing without fear of being 
exposed as a “fraud”? Do stu-
dents believe that they will be 
listened to? Are there ways to 
increase the potential of new 
positive interactions with 
peers for reasons other than 
academia, to give us a chance 
to breathe and explore?
Most of us choose every 
year to commit once again to 
Carnegie Mellon, but no one 
denies that there is much to be 
done to make all of Carnegie 
Mellon University’s promises 
and holistic potential a real-
ity. The magic of student gov-
ernment is in their attempt to 
1) understand the issues our 
students are facing and their 
causes and 2) expedite the 
process of creating a better 
university for the community 
it is serving. The ?nal ques-
tion we were asked to answer 
was, imagining that we could 
accomplish everything we 
wanted in our time on Presi-
dent’s Cabinet, what would 
those things be? Answers var-
ied from scholarships to im-
proved interfaces to student 
summits around a cause, but 
every single one was ambi-
tious and inspiring (all our 
active projects will soon be 
posted online!), and we are 
all so hopeful for the success 
of this school year.

said Zak. “In just a few short 
days, the national represen-
tatives and section leaders 
gave me all the information 
and resources I will need to 
lead a successful chapter.” 
He was selected as the stu-
dent president of Mortar 
Board a few months before 
the conference. The experi-
ence at the conference had 
transformed his perspective 
on Mortar Board.
At the 2016 conference, 
36 chapters out of all 231 
chapters in the nation were 
presented the Golden Torch 
award for their exemplary 
performance in the past 
year. The most recent grad-
uating alumni of the Carn-
egie Mellon Mortar Board 
have achieved excellence 
in their scholarship as well 
as their leadership in a va-
riety of events. “[Last year’s 
Mortar Board members] 
were all extremely excited 
to hear that they had won a 
Golden Torch as it was one 
of the goals they strove for 
last year,” said Zak, “I hope 
we can repeat their success-
es.”
In the upcoming months, 
the Carnegie Mellon Mor-
tar Board will kick off their 
annual fundraiser “Turkey 
for a Day.” This event hap-
pens around Thanksgiving 
to raise money for charities 
supported by different pro-
fessors. During this event, 
students at the university 
can donate to vote for their 
choice of professor. The four 
professors who receive the 
most donations will dress 
up in turkey costumes for a 
day. In the past years, Carn-
egie Mellon Mortar Board 
has successfully raised over 
$1,000 in this one event, 
and has donated to different 
non-profit organizations.
Being a part of the 
organization brings not only 
exceptional opportunities 
to participate in service 
and volunteering activities 
within the Carnegie Mellon 
and Pittsburgh community, 
but also plenty of chances to 
network with accomplished 
alumni from across the 
nation. Every member se-
lected is guaranteed a $500 
scholarship from ReadAcad, 
a prestigious non-profit 
venture management pro-
gram. In addition, the ben-
efit of membership also 
contains opportunities to 
apply to prestigious schol-
arships such as the NIH-
Oxford-Cambridge Scholars 
Program as well as the paid 
fellowship with City Hall 
Fellows.
Every spring, invitations 
will be sent to the top 30 
percent of the junior class to 
encourage them to apply to 
be members of the Mortar 
Board. After reviewing the 
applications, Mortar Board 
invites the top 50 applicants 
to join the chapter.
their preferred candidate. “I 
think getting frustrated and 
not voting doesn’t accomplish 
anything since you don’t get 
the government that you 
want,” he said.
There is a large contro-
versy surrounding the posi-
tion of P.A. Attorney Gen-
eral since Kathleen Kane, the 
previous Attorney General, 
was forced to resign in Aug. 
after being convicted of nine 
criminal charges including 
conspiracy, perjury, and ob-
struction of justice, according 
to The New York Times. That’s 
why Shapiro said his ?rst pri-
ority is to restore integrity to 
the of?ce. Shapiro believes 
that if he can hire people with 
integrity and establish a cul-
ture of honesty, he will “give 
the outside world the con?-
dence in what we are doing, 
and we will be able to tackle 
these challenges.”
Shapiro emphasized his 
integrity, contrasting it with 
Kane’s corruption by saying, 
“What you are hearing from 
me is what I say in every com-
munity across Pennsylvania. 
Someone said to me, ‘Oh my 
God, you are going to talk 
about LGBT rights in Western 
Pennsylvania?’ Yeah, not only 
am I going to talk about it, I 
am going to put an ad on TV 
about it.” Shapiro said this in 
the same spot where a same-
sex couple had previously 
gotten married.
Shapiro also promised 
to protect the right to safe 
drinking water for all Penn-
sylvanians. “That’s not just 
because I care about the envi-
ronment or that I’m endorsed 
by the Environmental Group. 
It’s because your state consti-
tution says you have a right to 
clean air and water,” he said.
Furthermore, Shapiro be-
lieves that the Pennsylvania 
education system is not thor-
ough and ef?cient, a violation 
of the state constitution. 
There is currently a case 
before the Supreme Court 
of Pennsylvania contesting 
whether the state has been 
providing a quality education 
to all students. Even though 
he is seeking to be Penn-
sylvania’s legal representa-
tive, Shapiro has announced 
that he will not support the 
Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania. “I will join with the 
plaintiffs and I will ?ght to 
make sure we get a thor-
ough and ef?cient education 
system,” he said.
Voters, including many 
Carnegie Mellon students, 
will have the opportunity to 
decide who will become At-

This Thursday, on Sept. 
22, Jonathan Rosenbaum, 
a freelance film critic, gave 
a lecture in Porter Hall 100 
about how the advent of 
the internet and modern 
technology has affected 
film criticism. Rosenbaum, 
who was the head film critic 
for the Chicago Reader for 
twenty years, continues to 
write film criticisms on his 
website.
After taking the stage, 
Rosenbaum immediately 
made it clear that “rather 
than planned-out lectures, 
[he] much prefers dialogues 
to monologues,” thus open-
ing himself up for questions 
and commentary. This was 
analogous to his general at-
titude toward film criticism. 
He enjoys having an online 
presence, as he feels like he 
has “more of a community 
profile on [his] website than 
[he] did when [he] was writ-
ing for the Chicago Reader.” 
Now that he can write for a 
more film-centric niche mar-
ket rather than for a general 
audience, he is able to open 
up a dialogue with his read-
ers about topics he and his 
readers are both passionate 
about. He mentioned a few 
instances where his read-
ers would write to him soon 
after he made a blog post, 
pointing out his typos and 
questioning his ideas.
In addition, with a 
website, Rosenbaum is able 
to reach a wider, more di-
verse audience. Accord-
ing to him, “at least half 
— sometimes more than 
half — of the people who 
come to the site are not even 
from the United States, but 
from various parts all over 
the world.” Even though 
Rosenbaum was given un-
usual freedoms, such as no 
limit on length, at the Chi-
cago Reader, he still had 
some limits put on him by 
his editors, and now without 
these restrictions he is able 
to reflect on the differences 
between both experiences.
His experience of being 
politically censored by his 
editors illustrated those lim-
its. In one of his articles, he 
mentioned his trip to Teh-
ran, saying that “walking 
down the street, [he] could 
see it was as multicultural 
as the United States,” and 
his editor would not allow 
him to write that unless he 
could prove it. Rosenbaum 
states that his editor was 
often selective, in a biased 
way, about what he needed 
hard evidence for and what 
he didn’t.
Throughout the lecture, 
Rosenbaum brought up the 
viewpoints of the opposing 
side, the side that sees mod-
ern technology as the slow 
destruction of film criticism. 
Some of his colleagues, in 
fact, “feel that there was a 
‘golden age of film criticism’ 
back in the ‘60s and ‘70s. 
That’s all over now. They 
basically see [the internet] 
in completely dystopian, 
negative terms,” Rosenbaum 
said. He also spoke about 
the issue of oversimplifica-
tion, calling the problem 
“a conflict between market 
and scholarship.” The sim-
pler an article, the wider an 
audience it will reach, and 
this kind of simplification 
leads to a certain amount of 
dishonesty, because reality 
is not always simple. 
In relation to this idea, 
Rosenbaum stated multiple 
times that we should not 
divide the world into 
black and white, right and 
wrong. To do so would be to 
overgeneralize.
The latter part of the 
lecture focused on discus-
sion. Multiple people in 
the audience asked ques-
tions which led to discus-
sions about film quality 
and the criteria for quality. 
Rosenbaum drew a distinc-
tion between “review” and 
“criticism,” saying that re-
views had some impact on 
the market, while criticism 
did not have a consumerist 
side to it. He also questioned 
if, with regard to art and cul-
ture, we have lowered our 
canon, or if we have simply 
changed the standards for 
something to be included in 
our canon.
The lecture was 
informative and, parallel 
to Rosenbaum’s vision, felt 
more like a dialogue than 
a monologue. It reflected 
the different facets of film 
criticism — its so-called 
“golden age,” and how it 
has changed in the face of 
modern technology; yet it 
also went beyond film and 
media. The talk touched on 
ideas like how the internet 
affects our perception of 
divisive issues, the impor-
tance of being honest about 
complexity and reality in 
writing, and the value of a 
diverse readership. Though 
Rosenbaum now writes for 
a smaller audience, they are 
more engaged and ready 
to comment on his work. 
According to him, and 
echoed by his readers, “the 
quality of the audience is 
much more important than 
the quantity.”
computer engineering and 
the co-director of the GM 
Collaborative Research 
Lab at Carnegie Mellon 
said in an interview for the 
Engineering Magazine.
Right now, the people 
of Pittsburgh can experi-
ence this technology in a 
self-driving car through 
Uber’s pilot program. The 
ride-sharing company will 
be inviting its most loyal 
customers to have the op-
tion of being picked up by 
one of these cars. When re-
questing an Uber, the rider 
will get a self-driving Uber, 
if available, that has a safety 
driver to make sure the ride 
goes as planned.
In a press release from 
Uber about self-driving cars 
being available in Pitts-
burgh, the company said 
that “self-driving Ubers 
have enormous potential 
to further [their] mission 
and improve society: re-
ducing the number of traf-
fic accidents, which today 
kill 1.3 million people a 
year; freeing up the 20 
percent of space in cities 
currently used to park the 
world’s billion plus cars; 
and cutting congestion, 
which wastes trillions of 
hours every year.”
Carnegie Mellon’s 
College of Engineering 
website says that predicted 
that the rise of AV technol-
ogy will change the world of 
transportation in the next 
ten years. Also, it’s expected 
that during the years 2020-
2030, cars will contain a 
virtual valet that will park 
cars by using a phone app 
and traffic jam assistance.
“In the not-so-distant 
future self-driving cars will 
provide society with many 
benefits pertaining to safety 
and quality of life,” said Ra-
jkumar in an interview for 
the Engineering Magazine.

Up to this point in my four-part 
defense of the two-party system, 
we have covered our modern me-
dia divide and a large piece of early 
American history. For those of you 
just tuning in, I will sum it up. Even 
though the Founding Fathers may 
have preferred to not have partisan 
divisions, the system they built in 
the Constitution lent itself to func-
tioning best with two parties. Fast 
forward to the present day, and our 
access to a broad spectrum of media 
has entrenched people in their be-
liefs. This has hampered our society’s 
ability to compromise, a critical com-
ponent of American governance in a 
two-party system.
For our entire lives, fellow stu-
dents, we have only known one kind 
of politics: that of zero-sum. It is win 
or lose. Today, we are going to ana-
lyze how we have reached this unsus-
tainable point in our political culture 
by looking back at the last 50 years of 
history and the factors that brought 
us to this election. This will include 
an exploration of a key principle for 
this argument: the Median Voter 
Theorem.
In the early part of the 20th cen-
tury, it was the Republicans who 
had the support of black voters (you 
know, because of the whole end-
ing slavery thing). Democrats kept 
those southern voters who helped 
elect Woodrow Wilson in 1912. Af-
ter the Great Depression and WWII, 
however, the ?ght for civil rights 
came to the forefront with the elec-
tion of 1948 and the emergence of 
the States’ Rights Democratic Party.
The 1948 Democratic conven-
tion saw northern Democrats ?ght 
to adopt a plank that endorsed 
Democratic President Truman’s pro-
civil rights agenda. Several southern 
states’ delegations walked out of the 
convention to form their own third 
party (around this single issue), and 
ran Strom Thurmond for President. 
These Southern Democrats became 
known as the States’ Rights Demo-
cratic Party, or the “Dixiecrats.”
In the end, Truman won in a stun-
ning upset over Republican Thomas 
Dewey. He did this even with Thur-
mond winning four southern states. 
But the Dixiecrats weren’t ?nished.
Through two Dwight Eisenhower 
routs of Democrat Adlai Stevenson 
and eight years of his Republican 
administration, the civil rights move-
ment gained steam, especially with 
the Brown v. Board of Education 
ruling in 1954. Then came one 
of the most tense elections in our 
history: 1960.
Democrat John F. Kennedy nar-
rowly defeated Republican Richard 
Nixon while holding off another anti-
civil rights insurrection from the Dix-
iecrats. Harry Byrd, a segregationist 
Democrat, received several electoral 
votes despite not actually running for 
President.
After Kennedy’s assassination 
and Democratic President Lyndon 
Johnson’s signing of the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act, the Dixiecrats began to 
defect from the party. This is the be-
ginning of the current divisions we 
know today. In the 1964 election, 
Johnson completely routed the GOP 
nominee, Barry Goldwater, who 
won only six states, ?ve of which 
were in the deep south, traditionally 
Democratic states. Then the 1965 
Voting Rights Act dismantled the 
Jim Crow laws of the south, causing 
even more Dixiecrats to defect to the 
Republican banner.
The 1968 election has incredible 
parallels to our current dilemma, 
which will be discussed at length 
next week. Nixon took up the cause 
of “Law and Order” (sound famil-
iar?). Thus was born the “Southern 
Strategy” to attract southern whites 
to the GOP, and we have seen how 
this is a core platform of the Repub-
lican Party today.
Nixon also criticized the John-
son administration’s handling of the 
Vietnam War. It was the war that led 
Johnson to decide not to run for re-
election. Nixon beat Hubert Hum-
phrey, who had been nominated af-
ter not running in the primaries. One 
can imagine why many on the left 
were not excited about Humphrey, 
who was associated with Johnson’s 
unpopular war. This election cycle 
saw the Dixiecrats rebel once again 
in the form of Mr. Segregation, 
George Wallace, and the “American 
Independent Party.”
Wallace used a law and order nar-
rative similar to Nixon’s, except he 
did not expect to win the election. 
He used his third party to attempt to 
prevent either party from achieving 
a majority in the Electoral College, 
making him the kingmaker when the 
House of Representatives would vote 
for President. This strategy failed 
however, and Nixon won. Wallace’s 
voters would ?ock to Nixon for his 
landslide reelection in 1972. Those 
segregationists, some of whom are 
still alive, found their home in the 
Republican Party for good.
After the Watergate scandal and 
Republican President Gerald Ford’s 
pardon of Nixon, Democrat Jimmy 
Carter won the election in 1976. Re-
publican Ronald Reagan ascended 
to the White House by winning the 
1980 election. Reagan incorporat-
ed religious conservatives into his 
coalition. These religious conserva-
tives still form a block of the current 
GOP. It should be noted that Reagan 
managed to make compromises with

It’s no secret that Zika is a growing 
concern in the U.S. With the number 
of cases rising, fast and accurate test-
ing is a necessity. However, many 
Americans are being caught off 
guard by the Center for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) prolong-
ing the testing process and leaving 
many potential cases undiagnosed. 
In July, the CDC released a ?owchart 
that broke down who should be test-
ed into three main groups: pregnant 
women who have traveled outside of 
the country, people that have shown 
symptoms, and sexual partners of 
people that have shown symptoms. 
These strict guidelines shut out 
groups like women who have trav-
eled recently and plan to become 
pregnant. Guidelines for men are 
even stricter, with testing opportu-
nities fewer and further between. 
Anger with the CDC has mounted 
as people go undiagnosed, but the 
source of the problem seems to lie 
elsewhere. As usual, it can be traced 
back to the gridlock in Congress.
The ?rst case of Zika was report-
ed in the U.S. on Jan. 15, 2016 when 
a baby was born in Hawaii to a moth-
er that had previously lived in Brazil. 
Then came the four cases in Miami, 
the ?rst time Zika had been locally 
transmitted in the continental U.S. 
The CDC began to advise against 
traveling to known Zika areas and 
America listened to its advice. But for 
those that chose to travel to events 
such as the 2016 Summer Olympics 
in Rio, they were not able to ?nd sol-
ace in the CDC’s testing policies. All 
the CDC could do was warn against 
travel and encourage long sleeves in 
places like Florida.
In August, the CDC spent $2.5 
million on lab equipment to increase 
their capacity to test for Zika, a small 
price in comparison to the $1.9 bil-
lion that President Obama asked for 
in February to ?ght the expansion 
of the disease. Despite this in?ux 
of new equipment, the CDC still re-
mained strict in its guidelines of who 
could be tested. Those at the bottom 
of the chain waiting for tests, how-
ever, still felt neglected. 
While the restrictions are in place 
to prevent an overload of testing, 
their exclusivity makes doctors hesi-
tant to diagnose Zika for fear of not 
being able to give their patient a de-
?nitive answer or proper treatment 
for weeks. This could lead to some-
one with Zika being misdiagnosed. It 
also makes health insurers reluctant 
to fund the testing unless the doctor 
has told them that the patient ap-
pears ill or pregnant.
There are two main reasons that 
the CDC seems to have set these 
guidelines about testing. The ?rst is 
the complicated history Zika funding 
has with Congress. Senate Demo-
crats blocked the initial attempt to 
pass a $1.1 billion Zika bill. While 
there seems to be no reason to block 
a bill dedicated to funding the ?ght 
against Zika, there were some hid-
den clauses snuck in by Republicans. 
Included in the bill were restricted 
access to contraceptives and weaker 
environmental restrictions on pesti-
cides. These provisions tried to ride 
the coattails of a bill that seemed 
sure to make it all the way to the oval 
of?ce. 
The failure of a new $1.1 billion 
dollar bill with revisions last week 
has divided the Senate even further 
with Democrats blaming Repub-
licans of trying to sneak funding 
away from other sectors of the gov-
ernments and Republicans calling 
Democrats out for a lack of biparti-
sanship. Meanwhile the CDC, which 
was supposed to get $394 million 
of funding from this bill, has made 
it known that they will run out of 
money at the end of this month.
The second factor impacting the 
access to Zika testing is the number 
of tests being ordered. At the be-
ginning of September, roughly 600 
people were tested for Zika with 
several others unable to get access 
to the tests. Due to a lack of funding, 
however, CDC hasn’t been able to 
expand the amount of tests they can 
run which has led to these stricter 
guidelines. Much of the anger seems 
to be focused on the CDC, but it has 
made it known that they were go-
ing broke for a while. It isn’t the one 
that decides how much of the budget 
pie it gets, Congress is, but with ten-
sions running high it seems like the 
most immediate reaction is to shoot 
the messenger.
Testing for Zika isn’t exactly 
a black and white process either. 
There are certain tests that have only 
been approved by the FDA in emer-
gency cases. One of these emergency 
tests is Trioplex real-time reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain re-
action (rRT-PCR). It detects the RNA 
of Zika virus. Regular rRT-PCR are 
permitted for use on people with and 
without symptoms of Zika. Results 
for this test are obtained through 
blood and urine samples. Serologic 
Zika tests look for antibodies that 
develop in the ?rst week of illness 
and are speci?cally for those that 
actually have the Zika virus. These 
tests can take time to show results 
and sometimes require an additional 
follow-up.
The amount of time needed for 
testing puts a serious bind on newly 
pregnant women who have recently 
traveled that would consider abor-
tion. With the most cases happening 
in Florida, it isn’t really convenient 
that their abortion laws are more on 
the strict side. The law allows abor-
tions during the ?rst two trimesters, 
after that it is only permissible if 
“necessary to save life or preserve 
health of mother.” This gives women 
roughly 28 weeks after conceiving to 
make a decision and with tests tak-
ing several weeks due to how many 
are being ordered, it doesn’t leave 
much time to make that decision.
The CDC has also not given cou-
ples who have traveled but would 
like to conceive many options either. 
If you or your partner has traveled 
to a Zika country, their suggestion is 
to wait eight weeks before trying to 
become pregnant. Their guidelines 
don’t mention trying to get tested 
at all. The only instance where they 
suggest talking to a healthcare pro-
vider is if either you or your part-
ner lives in a Zika area. Even then it 
doesn’t outright say get tested and 
talking to a doctor could just lead 
to a more prolonged diagnosis in 
this case.
In addition to the rules being 
cloudy for whom to prioritize with 
women, it’s even harder to under-
stand the advice of the CDC for men. 
While the disease can be spread 
through the semen of an infected 
man for six months, there is current-
ly not a way to test semen for Zika. 
The World Health Organization 
(WHO) recommends six months of 
protected sex for men who have been 
exposed to Zika, not testing.
The CDC is facing pressure from 
all ends of the spectrum from Con-
gress all the way down to citizens 
that fear for their health. The lim-
ited access to testing has made it 
dif?cult not only for women who 
want to get pregnant, but for men 
who would like to know if they risk 
the possibility of spreading Zika to 
their partners. It seems that stricter 
guidelines are the only way the CDC 
can cover their monetary de?cit, 
even if it means leaving several oth-
ers undiagnosed. Congress must 
close the funding gap, or people will 
continue to fall through the cracks. 
The CDC’s hands are tied, so citizens 
need to put pressure on the source of 
the problem and make Congress ap-
propriate the funds the CDC needs to 
function and protect Americans.

There is a long-standing stereo-
type that declares that women just 
aren’t as funny as men. This is an idea 
that dates back centuries — even in 
1695, William Congreve, a famous 
playwright, wrote in a letter “I must 
confess, I have never made any obser-
vation of what I apprehend to be true 
humor in women ... If ever anything 
does appear comical or ridiculous in 
a woman, I think it is little more than 
an acquired folly or an affectation.” 
In 2007, a Vanity Fair article by Chris-
topher Hitchens even justi?ed this 
statement by describing humor as 
an evolutionary tool, “Why are men, 
taken on average and as a whole, fun-
nier than women … The chief task in 
life that a man has to perform is that 
of impressing the opposite sex, and 
Mother Nature (as we laughingly call 
her) is not so kind to men. In fact, she 
equips many fellows with very little 
armament for the struggle. An aver-
age man has just one, outside chance: 
he had better be able to make the 
lady laugh.”
The comedy world is not kind to 
women. Female comedians have to 
deal with the sexism and misogyny 
that is present across the board, but 
they have to deal with it largely on 
their own. Much of the comedy busi-
ness involves freelancing, working 
off one’s reputation, and making con-
nections in order to ?nd gigs, mean-
ing that there is very little organized 
protection for women against sexism 
in the workplace. Comedy club own-
ers can very easily book shows with 
no female representation, and there 
is no HR department to which female 
comics can report complaints.
That is not to say that there hasn’t 
been progress. In June, Amy Schum-
er became the ?rst female comedian 
to headline at Madison Square Gar-
den. Comedy Central now has a va-
riety of series starring funny women, 
including “Not Safe with Nikki Gla-
ser” and “Another Period.” The 2011 
?lm Bridesmaids featured a cast 
dominated by hilarious women, and 
made over 280 million dollars at the 
box of?ce.
However, there is still a ways to 
go. There is not a single woman who 
has her own late night talk show. In 
2015’s season of “The Half Hour” 
on Comedy Central, there were only 
three female comics compared to 
eleven men, and that was the highest 
ratio of women on the show out of all 
?ve seasons. Women are still asked 
how they respond to the idea that 
women aren’t funny, as if that idea 
is something to be considered at all. 
In the words of Kristin Wiig, “I think 
the fact that people keep asking it im-
plies that it’s something we need to 
explain or defend. If [people] would 
watch movies or look at comedy and 
see how many talented, funny wom-
en are out there and have been since 
the beginning of time, people would 
stop asking that.”
Luckily, there are women speak-
ing out and blazing paths in comedy. 
Amy Poehler is a perfect example. 
The Parks and Recreation star is con-
stantly speaking out about feminism 
and about women helping other 
women, all while staking out her own 
path in the comedy world. As one of 
the founding members of the Upright 
Citizen’s Brigade, Poehler helped 
develop what is now one of the big-
gest improv and sketch theaters in 
the country. On Saturday Night Live, 
Poehler became the ?rst woman and 
third person ever to be promoted 
from featured player to full cast 
member during her ?rst season on 
the show. She starred as Leslie Knope 
on the beloved sitcom Parks and Rec-
reation, receiving multiple Emmy 
nominations and a Golden Globe, 
and has starred in movies such as Sis-
ters, Inside Out, and Blades of Glory.
However, it is not just Poehler’s 
amazing track record that sets her 
apart. Poehler is a strong advocate 
for women’s rights and female em-
powerment. As a founder of Amy 
Poehler’s Smart Girls organization, 
Poehler encourages young women 
to foster their imagination and in-
telligence, creating a place where 
“people can truly be their weird and 
wonderful selves.” Poehler also of-
ten speaks about the importance of 
women banding together to take a 
stand, rather than tearing each other 
down, as she says in her autobiog-
raphy Yes Please, “That is the motto 
women should constantly repeat 
over and over again. ‘Good for her! 
Not for me.’”
Indeed, women in comedy seem 
to be taking her advice and follow-
ing in her footsteps. In cities across 
the country, private Facebook groups 
are popping up for female comics, 
where women can share future proj-
ects, promote upcoming shows, give 
advice on how to manage the comedy 
scene, and collaborate. 
These groups can even be ha-
vens for women that have faced ha-
rassment or assault by others in the 
comedy world — in multiple cases, 
women have been able to warn oth-
ers about individuals, or get in touch 
with other survivors in order to bring 
allegations to light together.
It is this feeling of community and 
these role models that are chang-
ing the comedy world for the bet-
ter. It’s a long haul, but the disparity 
grows smaller with each young girl 
who sees the Poehlers and Schum-
ers of the world on television, with 
each woman who is supported by a 
group of like-minded, funny women, 
with each acknowledgement that 
though female comedians are more 
visible nowadays, a serious problem 
still remains.
For women in comedy, the idea 
that women are just as funny as men 
is fact. For the rest of the world, un-
fortunately, there are still strides to 
make. But, little by little, women are 
proving that sexism and misogyny in 
comedy are anything but funny.

Football games are an unlikely 
battleground for racial debate. 
However, when Colin Kaepernick, 
a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, 
refused to stand for the national an-
them before a game to protest police 
violence in America, it ignited fresh 
controversy to the already nation-
wide dispute.
The simple act of kneeling or sit-
ting while teammates and audience 
members pledged themselves to 
their country was intended, accord-
ing to Kaepernick, to bring attention 
to race issues in the U.S. 
However, it has inspired sharply 
contrasting perspectives of the true 
weight and meaning of the action. 
One is that of a sel?sh, pampered 
professional athlete pushing a per-
sonal agenda at the expense of his 
spectators. 
There were likely many veterans 
and government employees in the 
audience who would have been in-
sulted by this apparent rejection of 
their service and sacri?ce, in addi-
tion to any ordinary, patriotic Amer-
ican fans.
Yet there is another, more nu-
anced, perception — that of an 
American exemplifying the very 
ideals that the national anthem is 
supposed to represent. Colin Kae-
pernick’s decision to protest doesn’t 
mean that he rejects American val-
ues, but rather that he believes these 
values to have been abused by this 
nation. It is an attempt to remind his 
audience — which has now grown 
from a stadium to the entire na-
tion — of the meaning of the song 
they are singing. Not only free-
dom of expression, but of equal-
ity, speci?cally racial equality. 
In an interview after one 
of the games, Kaepernick told 
NFL Media, “I am not going 
to stand up to show pride in a 
?ag for a country that oppress-
es black people and people of 
color. To me, this is bigger than 
football and it would be sel?sh 
on my part to look the other way. 
There are bodies in the street and 
people getting paid leave and get-
ting away with murder.”
Last week, three Miami Dol-
phin players replicated his actions, 
kneeling together during the Star-
Spangled Banner before a game. 
In response, a police union for Bro-
ward County sheriff’s of?ce wanted 
to stop their protection of Dolphins 
players, challenging their constitu-
tional rights as NFL players. 
“I respect their right to have free-
dom of speech,” Jeff Bell, president 
of the union, told the Miami Herald. 
“However, in certain organizations 
and certain jobs you give up that 
right of your freedom of speech 
[temporarily] while you serve that 
job or while you play in an NFL 
game.”
Ironically, he’s completely cor-
rect, but not with regard to football 
players — it applies, rather, to him-
self. The NFL is not a government 
organization, so their employees 
are not considered servants of the 
people, and thus may retain their 
constitutional rights, such as free-
dom of speech. 
Police of?cers, however, do lose 
a certain degree of liberty when 
they put on their uniform. As law 
enforcement, they represent the 
authority of the government, and 
therefore must sacri?ce personal 
opinions in favor of their duty.
These few police union mem-
bers, as well as any other critics who 
may challenge these players’ rights 
to protest in this manner, seem to be 
laboring under the delusion that the 
Star-Spangled Banner represents 
only a ?awless nation of unques-
tioning loyalty and super?cially elo-
quent professions of freedom. 
It does not. The anthem repre-
sents a diverse and imperfect na-
tion, full of division and controver-
sy, because the only way to avoid 
con?ict in such a diverse nation is to 
force silence. 
These constitutional rights were 
created explicitly to protect us from 
any such compulsion. Kaepernick 
decided to break the forced 
silence that he believed 
to surround this contro-
versy of police violence, 
and so he kneeled, 
protected by the 
very music echoing 
around him.

Up to this point in my four-part 
defense of the two-party system, 
we have covered our modern me-
dia divide and a large piece of early 
American history. For those of you 
just tuning in, I will sum it up. Even 
though the Founding Fathers may 
have preferred to not have partisan 
divisions, the system they built in 
the Constitution lent itself to func-
tioning best with two parties. Fast 
forward to the present day, and our 
access to a broad spectrum of media 
has entrenched people in their be-
liefs. This has hampered our society’s 
ability to compromise, a critical com-
ponent of American governance in a 
two-party system.
For our entire lives, fellow stu-
dents, we have only known one kind 
of politics: that of zero-sum. It is win 
or lose. Today, we are going to ana-
lyze how we have reached this unsus-
tainable point in our political culture 
by looking back at the last 50 years of 
history and the factors that brought 
us to this election. This will include 
an exploration of a key principle for 
this argument: the Median Voter 
Theorem.
In the early part of the 20th cen-
tury, it was the Republicans who 
had the support of black voters (you 
know, because of the whole end-
ing slavery thing). Democrats kept 
those southern voters who helped 
elect Woodrow Wilson in 1912. Af-
ter the Great Depression and WWII, 
however, the ?ght for civil rights 
came to the forefront with the elec-
tion of 1948 and the emergence of 
the States’ Rights Democratic Party.
The 1948 Democratic conven-
tion saw northern Democrats ?ght 
to adopt a plank that endorsed 
Democratic President Truman’s pro-
civil rights agenda. Several southern 
states’ delegations walked out of the 
convention to form their own third 
party (around this single issue), and 
ran Strom Thurmond for President. 
These Southern Democrats became 
known as the States’ Rights Demo-
cratic Party, or the “Dixiecrats.”
In the end, Truman won in a stun-
ning upset over Republican Thomas 
Dewey. He did this even with Thur-
mond winning four southern states. 
But the Dixiecrats weren’t ?nished.
Through two Dwight Eisenhower 
routs of Democrat Adlai Stevenson 
and eight years of his Republican 
administration, the civil rights move-
ment gained steam, especially with 
the Brown v. Board of Education 
ruling in 1954. Then came one 
of the most tense elections in our 
history: 1960.
Democrat John F. Kennedy nar-
rowly defeated Republican Richard 
Nixon while holding off another anti-
civil rights insurrection from the Dix-
iecrats. Harry Byrd, a segregationist 
Democrat, received several electoral 
votes despite not actually running for 
President.
After Kennedy’s assassination 
and Democratic President Lyndon 
Johnson’s signing of the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act, the Dixiecrats began to 
defect from the party. This is the be-
ginning of the current divisions we 
know today. In the 1964 election, 
Johnson completely routed the GOP 
nominee, Barry Goldwater, who 
won only six states, ?ve of which 
were in the deep south, traditionally 
Democratic states. Then the 1965 
Voting Rights Act dismantled the 
Jim Crow laws of the south, causing 
even more Dixiecrats to defect to the 
Republican banner.
The 1968 election has incredible 
parallels to our current dilemma, 
which will be discussed at length 
next week. Nixon took up the cause 
of “Law and Order” (sound famil-
iar?). Thus was born the “Southern 
Strategy” to attract southern whites 
to the GOP, and we have seen how 
this is a core platform of the Repub-
lican Party today.
Nixon also criticized the John-
son administration’s handling of the 
Vietnam War. It was the war that led 
Johnson to decide not to run for re-
election. Nixon beat Hubert Hum-
phrey, who had been nominated af-
ter not running in the primaries. One 
can imagine why many on the left 
were not excited about Humphrey, 
who was associated with Johnson’s 
unpopular war. This election cycle 
saw the Dixiecrats rebel once again 
in the form of Mr. Segregation, 
George Wallace, and the “American 
Independent Party.”
Wallace used a law and order nar-
rative similar to Nixon’s, except he 
did not expect to win the election. 
He used his third party to attempt to 
prevent either party from achieving 
a majority in the Electoral College, 
making him the kingmaker when the 
House of Representatives would vote 
for President. This strategy failed 
however, and Nixon won. Wallace’s 
voters would ?ock to Nixon for his 
landslide reelection in 1972. Those 
segregationists, some of whom are 
still alive, found their home in the 
Republican Party for good.
After the Watergate scandal and 
Republican President Gerald Ford’s 
pardon of Nixon, Democrat Jimmy 
Carter won the election in 1976. Re-
publican Ronald Reagan ascended 
to the White House by winning the 
1980 election. Reagan incorporat-
ed religious conservatives into his 
coalition. These religious conserva-
tives still form a block of the current 
GOP. It should be noted that Reagan 
managed to make compromises with

It’s no secret that Zika is a growing 
concern in the U.S. With the number 
of cases rising, fast and accurate test-
ing is a necessity. However, many 
Americans are being caught off 
guard by the Center for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) prolong-
ing the testing process and leaving 
many potential cases undiagnosed. 
In July, the CDC released a ?owchart 
that broke down who should be test-
ed into three main groups: pregnant 
women who have traveled outside of 
the country, people that have shown 
symptoms, and sexual partners of 
people that have shown symptoms. 
These strict guidelines shut out 
groups like women who have trav-
eled recently and plan to become 
pregnant. Guidelines for men are 
even stricter, with testing opportu-
nities fewer and further between. 
Anger with the CDC has mounted 
as people go undiagnosed, but the 
source of the problem seems to lie 
elsewhere. As usual, it can be traced 
back to the gridlock in Congress.
The ?rst case of Zika was report-
ed in the U.S. on Jan. 15, 2016 when 
a baby was born in Hawaii to a moth-
er that had previously lived in Brazil. 
Then came the four cases in Miami, 
the ?rst time Zika had been locally 
transmitted in the continental U.S. 
The CDC began to advise against 
traveling to known Zika areas and 
America listened to its advice. But for 
those that chose to travel to events 
such as the 2016 Summer Olympics 
in Rio, they were not able to ?nd sol-
ace in the CDC’s testing policies. All 
the CDC could do was warn against 
travel and encourage long sleeves in 
places like Florida.
In August, the CDC spent $2.5 
million on lab equipment to increase 
their capacity to test for Zika, a small 
price in comparison to the $1.9 bil-
lion that President Obama asked for 
in February to ?ght the expansion 
of the disease. Despite this in?ux 
of new equipment, the CDC still re-
mained strict in its guidelines of who 
could be tested. Those at the bottom 
of the chain waiting for tests, how-
ever, still felt neglected. 
While the restrictions are in place 
to prevent an overload of testing, 
their exclusivity makes doctors hesi-
tant to diagnose Zika for fear of not 
being able to give their patient a de-
?nitive answer or proper treatment 
for weeks. This could lead to some-
one with Zika being misdiagnosed. It 
also makes health insurers reluctant 
to fund the testing unless the doctor 
has told them that the patient ap-
pears ill or pregnant.
There are two main reasons that 
the CDC seems to have set these 
guidelines about testing. The ?rst is 
the complicated history Zika funding 
has with Congress. Senate Demo-
crats blocked the initial attempt to 
pass a $1.1 billion Zika bill. While 
there seems to be no reason to block 
a bill dedicated to funding the ?ght 
against Zika, there were some hid-
den clauses snuck in by Republicans. 
Included in the bill were restricted 
access to contraceptives and weaker 
environmental restrictions on pesti-
cides. These provisions tried to ride 
the coattails of a bill that seemed 
sure to make it all the way to the oval 
of?ce. 
The failure of a new $1.1 billion 
dollar bill with revisions last week 
has divided the Senate even further 
with Democrats blaming Repub-
licans of trying to sneak funding 
away from other sectors of the gov-
ernments and Republicans calling 
Democrats out for a lack of biparti-
sanship. Meanwhile the CDC, which 
was supposed to get $394 million 
of funding from this bill, has made 
it known that they will run out of 
money at the end of this month.
The second factor impacting the 
access to Zika testing is the number 
of tests being ordered. At the be-
ginning of September, roughly 600 
people were tested for Zika with 
several others unable to get access 
to the tests. Due to a lack of funding, 
however, CDC hasn’t been able to 
expand the amount of tests they can 
run which has led to these stricter 
guidelines. Much of the anger seems 
to be focused on the CDC, but it has 
made it known that they were go-
ing broke for a while. It isn’t the one 
that decides how much of the budget 
pie it gets, Congress is, but with ten-
sions running high it seems like the 
most immediate reaction is to shoot 
the messenger.
Testing for Zika isn’t exactly 
a black and white process either. 
There are certain tests that have only 
been approved by the FDA in emer-
gency cases. One of these emergency 
tests is Trioplex real-time reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain re-
action (rRT-PCR). It detects the RNA 
of Zika virus. Regular rRT-PCR are 
permitted for use on people with and 
without symptoms of Zika. Results 
for this test are obtained through 
blood and urine samples. Serologic 
Zika tests look for antibodies that 
develop in the ?rst week of illness 
and are speci?cally for those that 
actually have the Zika virus. These 
tests can take time to show results 
and sometimes require an additional 
follow-up.
The amount of time needed for 
testing puts a serious bind on newly 
pregnant women who have recently 
traveled that would consider abor-
tion. With the most cases happening 
in Florida, it isn’t really convenient 
that their abortion laws are more on 
the strict side. The law allows abor-
tions during the ?rst two trimesters, 
after that it is only permissible if 
“necessary to save life or preserve 
health of mother.” This gives women 
roughly 28 weeks after conceiving to 
make a decision and with tests tak-
ing several weeks due to how many 
are being ordered, it doesn’t leave 
much time to make that decision.
The CDC has also not given cou-
ples who have traveled but would 
like to conceive many options either. 
If you or your partner has traveled 
to a Zika country, their suggestion is 
to wait eight weeks before trying to 
become pregnant. Their guidelines 
don’t mention trying to get tested 
at all. The only instance where they 
suggest talking to a healthcare pro-
vider is if either you or your part-
ner lives in a Zika area. Even then it 
doesn’t outright say get tested and 
talking to a doctor could just lead 
to a more prolonged diagnosis in 
this case.
In addition to the rules being 
cloudy for whom to prioritize with 
women, it’s even harder to under-
stand the advice of the CDC for men. 
While the disease can be spread 
through the semen of an infected 
man for six months, there is current-
ly not a way to test semen for Zika. 
The World Health Organization 
(WHO) recommends six months of 
protected sex for men who have been 
exposed to Zika, not testing.
The CDC is facing pressure from 
all ends of the spectrum from Con-
gress all the way down to citizens 
that fear for their health. The lim-
ited access to testing has made it 
dif?cult not only for women who 
want to get pregnant, but for men 
who would like to know if they risk 
the possibility of spreading Zika to 
their partners. It seems that stricter 
guidelines are the only way the CDC 
can cover their monetary de?cit, 
even if it means leaving several oth-
ers undiagnosed. Congress must 
close the funding gap, or people will 
continue to fall through the cracks. 
The CDC’s hands are tied, so citizens 
need to put pressure on the source of 
the problem and make Congress ap-
propriate the funds the CDC needs to 
function and protect Americans.

There is a long-standing stereo-
type that declares that women just 
aren’t as funny as men. This is an idea 
that dates back centuries — even in 
1695, William Congreve, a famous 
playwright, wrote in a letter “I must 
confess, I have never made any obser-
vation of what I apprehend to be true 
humor in women ... If ever anything 
does appear comical or ridiculous in 
a woman, I think it is little more than 
an acquired folly or an affectation.” 
In 2007, a Vanity Fair article by Chris-
topher Hitchens even justi?ed this 
statement by describing humor as 
an evolutionary tool, “Why are men, 
taken on average and as a whole, fun-
nier than women … The chief task in 
life that a man has to perform is that 
of impressing the opposite sex, and 
Mother Nature (as we laughingly call 
her) is not so kind to men. In fact, she 
equips many fellows with very little 
armament for the struggle. An aver-
age man has just one, outside chance: 
he had better be able to make the 
lady laugh.”
The comedy world is not kind to 
women. Female comedians have to 
deal with the sexism and misogyny 
that is present across the board, but 
they have to deal with it largely on 
their own. Much of the comedy busi-
ness involves freelancing, working 
off one’s reputation, and making con-
nections in order to ?nd gigs, mean-
ing that there is very little organized 
protection for women against sexism 
in the workplace. Comedy club own-
ers can very easily book shows with 
no female representation, and there 
is no HR department to which female 
comics can report complaints.
That is not to say that there hasn’t 
been progress. In June, Amy Schum-
er became the ?rst female comedian 
to headline at Madison Square Gar-
den. Comedy Central now has a va-
riety of series starring funny women, 
including “Not Safe with Nikki Gla-
ser” and “Another Period.” The 2011 
?lm Bridesmaids featured a cast 
dominated by hilarious women, and 
made over 280 million dollars at the 
box of?ce.
However, there is still a ways to 
go. There is not a single woman who 
has her own late night talk show. In 
2015’s season of “The Half Hour” 
on Comedy Central, there were only 
three female comics compared to 
eleven men, and that was the highest 
ratio of women on the show out of all 
?ve seasons. Women are still asked 
how they respond to the idea that 
women aren’t funny, as if that idea 
is something to be considered at all. 
In the words of Kristin Wiig, “I think 
the fact that people keep asking it im-
plies that it’s something we need to 
explain or defend. If [people] would 
watch movies or look at comedy and 
see how many talented, funny wom-
en are out there and have been since 
the beginning of time, people would 
stop asking that.”
Luckily, there are women speak-
ing out and blazing paths in comedy. 
Amy Poehler is a perfect example. 
The Parks and Recreation star is con-
stantly speaking out about feminism 
and about women helping other 
women, all while staking out her own 
path in the comedy world. As one of 
the founding members of the Upright 
Citizen’s Brigade, Poehler helped 
develop what is now one of the big-
gest improv and sketch theaters in 
the country. On Saturday Night Live, 
Poehler became the ?rst woman and 
third person ever to be promoted 
from featured player to full cast 
member during her ?rst season on 
the show. She starred as Leslie Knope 
on the beloved sitcom Parks and Rec-
reation, receiving multiple Emmy 
nominations and a Golden Globe, 
and has starred in movies such as Sis-
ters, Inside Out, and Blades of Glory.
However, it is not just Poehler’s 
amazing track record that sets her 
apart. Poehler is a strong advocate 
for women’s rights and female em-
powerment. As a founder of Amy 
Poehler’s Smart Girls organization, 
Poehler encourages young women 
to foster their imagination and in-
telligence, creating a place where 
“people can truly be their weird and 
wonderful selves.” Poehler also of-
ten speaks about the importance of 
women banding together to take a 
stand, rather than tearing each other 
down, as she says in her autobiog-
raphy Yes Please, “That is the motto 
women should constantly repeat 
over and over again. ‘Good for her! 
Not for me.’”
Indeed, women in comedy seem 
to be taking her advice and follow-
ing in her footsteps. In cities across 
the country, private Facebook groups 
are popping up for female comics, 
where women can share future proj-
ects, promote upcoming shows, give 
advice on how to manage the comedy 
scene, and collaborate. 
These groups can even be ha-
vens for women that have faced ha-
rassment or assault by others in the 
comedy world — in multiple cases, 
women have been able to warn oth-
ers about individuals, or get in touch 
with other survivors in order to bring 
allegations to light together.
It is this feeling of community and 
these role models that are chang-
ing the comedy world for the bet-
ter. It’s a long haul, but the disparity 
grows smaller with each young girl 
who sees the Poehlers and Schum-
ers of the world on television, with 
each woman who is supported by a 
group of like-minded, funny women, 
with each acknowledgement that 
though female comedians are more 
visible nowadays, a serious problem 
still remains.
For women in comedy, the idea 
that women are just as funny as men 
is fact. For the rest of the world, un-
fortunately, there are still strides to 
make. But, little by little, women are 
proving that sexism and misogyny in 
comedy are anything but funny.

BLM national anthem protests protect rights
CHIE WACH
 Staffwriter
Football games are an unlikely 
battleground for racial debate. 
However, when Colin Kaepernick, 
a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, 
refused to stand for the national an-
them before a game to protest police 
violence in America, it ignited fresh 
controversy to the already nation-
wide dispute.
The simple act of kneeling or sit-
ting while teammates and audience 
members pledged themselves to 
their country was intended, accord-
ing to Kaepernick, to bring attention 
to race issues in the U.S. 
However, it has inspired sharply 
contrasting perspectives of the true 
weight and meaning of the action. 
One is that of a sel?sh, pampered 
professional athlete pushing a per-
sonal agenda at the expense of his 
spectators. 
There were likely many veterans 
and government employees in the 
audience who would have been in-
sulted by this apparent rejection of 
their service and sacri?ce, in addi-
tion to any ordinary, patriotic Amer-
ican fans.
Yet there is another, more nu-
anced, perception — that of an 
American exemplifying the very 
ideals that the national anthem is 
supposed to represent. Colin Kae-
pernick’s decision to protest doesn’t 
mean that he rejects American val-
ues, but rather that he believes these 
values to have been abused by this 
nation. It is an attempt to remind his 
audience — which has now grown 
from a stadium to the entire na-
tion — of the meaning of the song 
they are singing. Not only free-
dom of expression, but of equal-
ity, speci?cally racial equality. 
In an interview after one 
of the games, Kaepernick told 
NFL Media, “I am not going 
to stand up to show pride in a 
?ag for a country that oppress-
es black people and people of 
color. To me, this is bigger than 
football and it would be sel?sh 
on my part to look the other way. 
There are bodies in the street and 
people getting paid leave and get-
ting away with murder.”
Last week, three Miami Dol-
phin players replicated his actions, 
kneeling together during the Star-
Spangled Banner before a game. 
In response, a police union for Bro-
ward County sheriff’s of?ce wanted 
to stop their protection of Dolphins 
players, challenging their constitu-
tional rights as NFL players. 
“I respect their right to have free-
dom of speech,” Jeff Bell, president 
of the union, told the Miami Herald. 
“However, in certain organizations 
and certain jobs you give up that 
right of your freedom of speech 
[temporarily] while you serve that 
job or while you play in an NFL 
game.”
Ironically, he’s completely cor-
rect, but not with regard to football 
players — it applies, rather, to him-
self. The NFL is not a government 
organization, so their employees 
are not considered servants of the 
people, and thus may retain their 
constitutional rights, such as free-
dom of speech. 
Police of?cers, however, do lose 
a certain degree of liberty when 
they put on their uniform. As law 
enforcement, they represent the 
authority of the government, and 
therefore must sacri?ce personal 
opinions in favor of their duty.
These few police union mem-
bers, as well as any other critics who 
may challenge these players’ rights 
to protest in this manner, seem to be 
laboring under the delusion that the 
Star-Spangled Banner represents 
only a ?awless nation of unques-
tioning loyalty and super?cially elo-
quent professions of freedom. 
It does not. The anthem repre-
sents a diverse and imperfect na-
tion, full of division and controver-
sy, because the only way to avoid 
con?ict in such a diverse nation is to 
force silence. 
These constitutional rights were 
created explicitly to protect us from 
any such compulsion. Kaepernick 
decided to break the forced 
silence that he believed 
to surround this contro-
versy of police violence, 
and so he kneeled, 
protected by the 
very music echoing 
around him.

CASSIE SCANLON
 Junior Staffwriter
Imagine you’re at work. There has 
been buzz surrounding a new em-
ployee, and your coworker won’t stop 
pestering you on your opinion of the 
new employee. Wanting to stay out 
of the of?ce politics, but also wanting 
to be left alone, you answer a simple, 
“As of now, I don’t like him, but we’ve 
only had one conversation.” Satis-
?ed, your coworker returns to her 
work, and never brings up this new 
employee again.
But the next morning, on the 
front page of the of?ce newsletter is 
an article about how much you hate 
the new employee and are hoping 
he is ?red as soon as possible. In the 
article, there is no reference to the 
actual words you said, but sim-
ply an analysis of what you 
said, taken completely out of 
context. It 
sounds 
completely unrealistic, but it’s not. 
This is something the American me-
dia has done far too often this elec-
tion cycle and, in turn, they have 
harmed the American political pro-
cess.
With an outspoken candidate like 
Donald Trump, the media has taken 
it into their own hands to interpret 
what Trump said without providing 
what he actually said. The New York 
Times recently published an article 
claiming that Trump said he believes 
that Barack Obama was born in the 
United States, and any claim oth-
erwise was simply Hillary Clinton’s 
latest attempt to prove 
him distrustful. 
But, inter-
estingly 
enough, the author Michael Barbaro 
never directly quoted the entirety of 
what Trump said, and only offered 
his own analysis.
The New York Times’ goal is clear: 
to continue to paint distrust in Don-
ald Trump and show how he is inept 
to be President of the United States. 
Trump has been notorious this elec-
tion for his fear mongering tactics, 
and Barbaro’s article (and many 
others like it) are the media’s way of 
employing their own fear monger-
ing tactics. Fearful that America may 
elect Trump, they too play into the 
game, and only offer their fear rid-
den analysis.
But Americans aren’t as unedu-
cated as the mass media would like 
to believe. Instead, these fear mon-
gering tactics have become notice-
able, and the public’s trust in 
the media is falling. Gallup 
recently conducted a poll 
on the public’s percep-
tion of the media, 
and found that only 32 percent have 
some trust in the media. This number 
has been decreasing steadily, espe-
cially among Americans aged 18-49, 
a measly 26 percent of whom ?nd the 
media trustful.
The lack of trust in the media 
harms the American political pro-
cess. With the media also labeling 
politicians as “stupid,” it contrib-
utes to the increasing polarization 
in America. Instead of allowing the 
public to form their own opinions 
on what was said or happened, the 
media presents a two-sided issue and 
defends one side. But political issues 
are never as black and white as they 
seem, and the current media presen-
tation of issues does not allow for a 
gray area.
While 
many Ameri-
cans may 
be dis-
trust-
ful of 
the 
media, it is the place they go to when 
they want to keep up to date with 
current events. So while the general 
public may be distrustful of what is 
said, at the end of the day they do 
see issues as two-sided. While Clin-
ton supporters may have enjoyed The 
New York Times article, it only con-
tinued to place distrust in the media 
among Trump supporters and creat-
ed further tension between the two.
This tension further harms the 
American political process as it de-
creases compromise among Demo-
crats and Republicans. Democrats 
see Fox News as destructive and Re-
publicans see CNN as spreading mis-
information, and the increasing bias 
present in both continues the polar-
ization of America.
If the media instead focused on 
reporting the facts — what was said 
and what happened — in a factual 
manner, Americans would be more 
willing to compromise. They would 
not be offered an analysis of what is 
said, but simply freedom to come to 
their own conclusions. And if Trump 
is as terrible as many media outlets 
believe, most Americans will come to 
the same conclusion, anyways.
This isn’t to say that the media 
shouldn’t provide any analysis. With 
less than half the American popula-
tion aged 25 and older possessing 
at least an associate’s degree, most 
Americans don’t have the education 
level to understand or the time to re-
search how current events affect our 
domestic and foreign affairs. But the 
media should ?rst present current 
events in a factual manner, and then 
allow for analysis without the name 
calling.
The Founding Fathers included 
“freedom of speech, or the press” to 
allow Americans to be free to express 
their political opinions, and to have 
access to information without gov-
ernment interference. The press is 
meant to belong to the people and it’s 
time we are provided with the truth, 
not simply an analysis of it.
the minority Democrats to pass laws 
on immigration and gun reform. We 
will return to how this sense of prag-
matism disappeared.
The next three elections saw Re-
publican landslides. This can be at-
tributed to not only poor campaigns 
from the Democrats who ran against 
Reagan and Bush, but also from 
the general shift of ideology of the 
American electorate. The 1960’s and 
70’s saw a shift to the left in John-
son’s Great Society programs, but 
the counter-movement to this was a 
shift to conservatism in the 1980’s. 
This is all extremely simpli?ed, but 
can be illustrated using the Median 
Voter Theorem.
For the record, I am not a math 
major; in this portion of defending 
the two-party system, I have tapped 
the wisdom of Carnegie Mellon 
Math professor Mary Radcliffe for 
an explanation. The Median Voter 
Theorem follows the logic that two 
main parties in a country will want 
to appease the most number of vot-
ers by appealing to a median voter. 
They don’t need to hit the precise 
middle of the political spectrum, 
but a point that covers a majority of 
the electorate.
The basic model of the theorem 
puts all voters only on one dimen-
sion; for all intents and purposes, 
we will imagine it in two. If you are 
given an xy axis, and set one axis as 
a personal freedom preference, and 
one as an economic freedom pref-
erence, you can put Liberal, Statist, 
Conservative, and Libertarian in four 
quadrants with a centrist section in 
the middle. By using data guaging 
opinions from major voter blocks, 
we can plot points of the preferences 
of large numbers of American vot-
ers. The Pew Research Survey, that 
analyzes where you stand on the po-
litical spectrum, breaks the popula-
tion down into seven major groups: 
Steadfast Conservatives, Business 
Conservatives, Young Outsiders, 
Hard-Pressed Skeptics, Next Genera-
tion Left, Faith and Family Left, and 
Solid Liberals.
Putting these voting groups’ pref-
erences on a graph shows where 
candidates should stand on certain 
issues to have the support of the 
broadest coalition. Multiple parties 
would put smaller voter blocks in 
constant con?ict as these narrower 
minded parties would have trouble 
forming effective coalitions. If a 
candidate in a two-party system can 
achieve a majority coalition, it ide-
ally ensures that the party that wins 
the election represents the majority 
of the people. One can also plot can-
didates individually and ?nd from 
where they form their coalitions and 
how far they are from the ideal posi-
tion on the spectrum.
The preferences of major blocks 
can also change over periods of time, 
causing shifts in the entire electorate. 
Moving back toward our historical 
discussion, we can imagine that the 
median voter shifted from the left to 
the right from the 1960’s to the 80’s, 
causing the GOP to more easily gar-
ner a large coalition. In response, the 
Democrats rebranded many of their 
ideals toward the center, culminat-
ing in the election of the center-left 
Bill Clinton in 1992. The electorate 
had shifted back to the left.
Skipping forward, the election of 
2000 may have been one of the most 
disruptive elections of our history. 
Another third party, led by Ralph 
Nader, disrupted the two-party bal-
ance and threw the election toward 
Republican George W. Bush, who 
won the Electoral College vote but 
not the popular vote after a month-
long legal dispute about a Florida re-
count in the Supreme Court. Despite 
the shift to the left, we now had a 
Republican president.
Having reached the Bush era, 
we have now passed the point dis-
cussed last week when media sourc-
es started to arise that were further 
apart ideologically than ever before. 
Our politics started to enter an era 
of intense partisanship; compro-
mise fell to the wayside in favor of 
obstructionism. This only intensi-
?ed with the election of Democrat 
Barack Obama in 2008.
As we discussed in the beginning 
of this article, the current GOP coali-
tion includes voters that supported 
segregation just a few decades prior. 
From their perspective, the election 
of the ?rst black man signi?ed that 
they had lost a long battle. Now I 
am not insinuating that the GOP is 
mainly made up of these voters, but 
sometimes they become the loudest 
voices in the room de?ning the im-
age of a party. The GOP took up ob-
structionism with the sworn promise 
to make Obama a one-term presi-
dent. It helped create the least pro-
ductive Congresses ever, and by far. 
These policies of hindrance that both 
parties have taken part in rather 
than active governance have greatly 
intensi?ed the partisan divide.
We are now at a breaking point. 
The Constitution designed by the 
founders favors two major parties; 
the government cannot adequately 
function if rivals don’t make com-
promises. Broad coalitions that ap-
peal to the most voters can achieve 
progress, albeit at a measured pace. 
Our two-party system is the most 
effective way to continue that pace, 
yet it is faltering under the weight of 
obstructionism. In such a large coun-
try as ours, anything too extreme 
on either side may be harmful to 
our republic.

four quadrents, and then plot the approximate location each of the seven 
major Pew political groups. Clinton (H) and Trump (D) are also plotted.

Donald Trump has degraded a lot 
of people on his climb to the nomi-
nation, but his ignorance and preju-
dice isn’t what this article is about. 
It’s about the ignorance and preju-
dice of the people trying to stop him.
Throughout most of history, 
people have used humor to combat 
those in political power, and the po-
litical cartoonists of today have been 
keeping that noble tradition alive, 
with Trump supplying plenty of am-
munition. Most of these comics are 
brilliant, but there are quite a few 
bad apples mixed in that make my 
laughter go sour. Somehow, in their 
rush to highlight the way Trump 
stigmatizes and demonizes whole 
groups of people they’ve decided it’s 
okay to demonize the mentally ill.
The comic that illustrates this 
point most eloquently ran on politi-
calcartoons.com last month, and de-
picts Trump sitting in a padded cell, 
bound in a straight jacket and shout-
ing phrases like, “Ban Muslims!” and 
“Build a wall!.” 
While Trump’s characterization 
of all Muslims as terrorists and all 
Mexican immigrants as criminals 
that need to be kept out of the Unit-
ed States is deplorable, implying 
that these are the kinds of things 
people in mental hospitals say is also 
damaging. It depicts the mentally ill 
as hateful and down right danger-
ous, which, ?rstly, is far from the 
truth and, secondly, plays into and 
reinforces stereotypes of mental ill-
ness that need to be torn down. 
The comic also uses the straight 
jacket and padded cell to undercut 
what Trump is saying and imply that 
no one should take him seriously 
since they are just the ramblings of a 
crazy person. Again, this reinforces 
damaging ideas about the mentally 
ill. Mentally ill people deserve to be 
listened to, and implying otherwise 
forti?es an existing culture that of-
ten leaves them excluded, taken ad-
vantage of, or ignored.
This trend in political cartoons 
in not just a fringe phenomenon. 
The Chattanooga Times Free Press 
Editorial Cartoonist Clay Bennett, 
who, according to the Times Free 
Press website, has “won almost 
every honor his profession has to 
offer” including a Pulitzer Prize, has 
published several of these offensive 
cartoons. One I found particularly 
striking, published last week in the 
Times Free Press, depicts two pre-
scription bottles, one for Clinton 
and one for Trump. Clinton’s bottle 
bears the label “Antibiotics” while 
Trump’s says “Antipsychotics,” the 
implication being that Clinton’s 
physical health troubles are better 
than Trump’s tendency to act errati-
cally and do stupid things. 
However, the comic also says that 
people shouldn’t vote for someone 
who takes antipsychotics. It simul-
taneously supports the destruction 
of barriers to the presidency by en-
dorsing Clinton, the ?rst female 
nominee for a major political party, 
and builds barriers for anyone who 
takes medicine for a mental illness. 
In addition, it automatically attach-
es a negative connotation to anti-
psychotics and the people who take 
them, even though antipsychotics 
treat a whole range of disorders, 
many of which have absolutely no 
effect on other people and just make 
it harder for the af?icted person to 
function, and none of which auto-
matically make someone bigoted, 
hateful, or dangerous.
Subtle putdowns and insults to-
ward the mentally ill have not been 
restricted to political cartoons and 
newsprint. They jump off the page 
every time someone says Trump 
is insane, or should be locked in a 
mental hospital. Think about how 
often you’ve heard someone say 
that. Now think about what it’s like 
to hear that when you’ve been in a 
mental hospital.
As a woman who struggles with 
mental illness, I’ve been getting 
mixed messages from this elec-
tion. I’ve watched Clinton shatter a 
glass ceiling that existed for every 
generation of women before me, 
but I’ve also heard again and again 
that people like me, the mentally ill, 
cannot be trusted in politics, should 
be ignored, and are automatically 
dangerous.
I honestly love seeing politi-
cal cartoonists taking up the pen 
against Trump. I ?rmly believe that 
humor is one of the best weapons 
we have, particularly against those 
in power. But in our ?ght against the 
powerful we need to be careful not 
to victimize people who are already 
victims.

Magnetic bacteria may be next cancer breakthrough
In the journey to develop a 
nano-carrier to deliver tumor-
?ghting drugs, researchers of 
the Polytechnique Montréal 
NanoRobotics Laboratory 
may have discovered a natural 
means to effectively transport 
the drugs — magnetic bacteria 
called magnetococcus marinus.
These bacteria have the 
potential to overcome the 
challenges that other arti?-
cial bio-chemical nanocarri-
ers face, including the ability 
to naturally navigate to areas 
with low oxygen levels, which 
is the de?ning characteristic of 
where metastasis, or division 
of cancer cells, occurs. 
This will allow for more 
drugs to reach the tumor and 
hopefully slow down the rate 
of metastasis. The research 
team has conducted prelimi-
nary tests on mice and rats, 
and the results have been 
promising. 
The ?ndings have been pub-
lished in the August 2016 issue 
of Nature Nanotechnology.

Gaia measures speed of universe expansion
The value of the expansion 
rate of the universe, as report-
ed by the Gaia space telescope, 
is much faster than what scien-
tists expected. This is not the 
?rst time that telescopes have 
proposed this, but Gaia’s ?nd-
ings are signi?cant because its 
measurements are regarded to 
be the most precise. 
If Gaia’s observations are 
correct, the timescale sci-
entists currently have of the 
universe will be reduced by 
a few hundred million years. 
Furthermore, Gaia has the 
potential to be revolutionary 
in the quest to determine the 
Hubble Constant which de-
?nes the relationship between 
the distance of galaxies and 
how the wavelength of the 
light stretches. 
The Hubble Constant is 
the key to ?nding the rate at 
which the cosmos is expand-
ing, and Gaia, once it com-
pletes its orbit in 2019, should 
have the ability to measure the 
Hubble Constant to a precision 
of 1 percent.

Plastic developed that can move like a caterpillar
A research lab at the Uni-
versity of Warsaw created a 
new “robot caterpillar” out 
of plastic that is half an inch 
long, a few millimeters wide, 
and as thin as human hair. 
When exposed to green laser 
light, it begins to move across 
a surface by undulating like a 
caterpillar and can carry up to 
ten times its weight. 
The type of plastic used 
contains liquid crystalline 
elastomers, and the lasers 
cause it to move by altering 
the shape of the molecules in 
the plastic. The purpose of 
this creation was to explore 
a ?eld of robots without us-
ing wires and batteries and 
other seemingly essential 
hardware. 
Currently, there are no 
practical applications of this 
mini robot caterpillar, but the 
aim is to begin a new thought 
process in robotics that strays 
away from the traditional 
wire-battery-motor scheme. 
This technology is promising.

Tropical dry forests are important, un-protected habitats
Although tropical dry for-
ests are home to many spe-
cies not found elsewhere in 
the world, few are protected 
from deforestation. For ex-
ample, while almost ten per-
cent of the Amazon rainforest 
is fully protected, only one 
percent of the Caatinga dry 
forest in northern Brazil is 
under protection. 
The range of tropical dry 
forests has diminished to ten 
percent of what it used to be, 
due to their ideal conditions 
for growing cash crops. 
A team from the Latin 
America and Caribbean Sea-
sonally Dry Tropical Forest 
Floristic Network claims that 
these trees’ abilities to adapt 
to heat and drought should 
make tropical dry forest con-
servation a global priority in 
light of global warming. 
The next step for this team 
is raising awareness in Latin 
American communities in the 
hopes of catching the atten-
tion of the policymakers.

Extinct reptile species resembles dinosaurs
Paleontologists have iden-
ti?ed a new species of reptile, 
Triopticus primus, from before 
the age of dinosaurs — an es-
timated 230 million years ago. 
After CT scanning, paleontolo-
gists found that the Triopticus 
primus’ skull bears a resem-
blance both externally and 
internally to that of the dome-
headed Pachycephalosaurus 
dinosaurs, like the Stegoceras. 
This discovery of distantly 
related animals — and in this 
case, 150 million years’ worth 
of distance — resembling each 
other is called convergence. 
Originally, paleontologists 
believed that many of the di-
nosaurs’ features were unique, 
but they are beginning to un-
cover many fossils of reptiles 
that resemble those suppos-
edly “unique” body shapes. 
Researchers have stated 
that the discovery of the con-
vergence of so many different 
reptiles in the same area is ex-
tremely rare, making this an 
even more interesting ?nding.

Bourbon inspires scientists to use ?re to clean oil spill
Three scientists from the 
University of Maryland were 
inspired by a video of burning 
bourbon to apply a ?re whirl, 
or tornado of ?re, to oil spills. 
During their research, the sci-
entists found that ?re whirls 
are ef?cient in burning fuel, 
but produce soot to give the 
?re a yellow color. 
However, during the exper-
iments, the ?re whirl quickly 
turned blue. In addition, the 
?re whirl was even more ef-
?cient and did not produce 
any soot. 
They do not know why the 
vortex turned blue at this point 
in their research and have not 
found any evidence that sug-
gests other reports of blue ?re 
whirls, but they will attempt to 
recreate the blue “?renado” at 
an even larger scale to hope-
fully combat future oil spills.

Whether it is birthday 
cards or smiley faces drawn in 
the margins of our notebooks, 
getting personalized messag-
es makes us feel special and 
brightens up our day.  
New studies show that 
getting these messages in digi-
tal form is just as powerful as 
getting them in person.
In particular, Facebook 
offers a prime platform 
for sending and receiving 
personalized messages. 
However, personalized 
messages must be more than 
simply reading or “liking” a 
post in order to compare to 
the intensity of the feelings we 
would get if these messages 
were received in person.  
“We’re not talking about 
anything that’s particularly 
labor-intensive,” said Moira 
Burke, a research scientist 
on the data science team at 
Facebook, in a university 
press release. 
“This can be a comment 
that’s just a sentence or two. 
The important thing is that 
someone such as a close friend 
takes the time to personal-
ize it. The content may be 
uplifting, and the mere act 
of communication reminds 
recipients of the meaningful 
relationships in their lives.”
One of the most successful 
activities Facebook has devel-
oped in this regard is notifying 
friends about your birthday on 
Facebook and allowing them 
to write on your wall. 
Comments such as “Happy 
Birthday!” remind us of our 
meaningful relationships, 
and comments that include 
personalized photo collages 
make us feel just as good as if 
we recieved a card in person.
Burke earned a Ph.D. in 
human-computer interaction 
at Carnegie Mellon in 2011. 
Her research interests include 
bridging computer science and 
social psychology, speci?cally 
large-scale computational 
analysis of social patterns in 
online communities.
Burke teamed up with 
Robert Kraut, Burke’s Ph.D ad-
visor and the Herbert A. Simon 
Professor of Human-Comput-
er Interaction in the School of 
Computer Science and Tepper 
School of Business, to investi-
gate how personalized mes-
sages impact people’s psycho-
logical well-being. 
Kraut, who began his ca-
reer as a social psychologist, 
has a broad research interest 
in the design and social impact 
of information technologies 
in in the home, small groups, 
and in organizations.
In their most recent 
study, the pair of research-
ers examined 60 comments 
from close friends in a month 
and found that the positive 
comments correlated to an in-
crease in the user’s psychologi-
cal well-being as large as those 
feelings were associated with 
major life events such as get-
ting married, having a child, or 
getting a  promotion at work.
According to the study’s 
abstract, “An extensive litera-
ture shows that social relation-
ships in?uence psychological 
well-being, but the underlying 
mechanisms remain unclear. 
We test predictions about 
online interactions and well-
being made by theories of 
belongingness, relationship 
maintenance, relational in-
vestment, social support, and 
social comparison.” 
The study, entitled “The 
Relationship Between Face-
book Use and Well-Being 
Depends on Communication 
Type and Tie Strength Au-
thors” was published by the 
Journal of Computer-Mediated 
Communication in late July, 
and the research was sup-
ported by the National Science 
Foundation and Google.
These ?ndings contrast 
with many previous studies, 
which used opt-in user sur-
veys to determine that spend-
ing more time on social me-
dia correlates to depression 
or loneliness. 
Kraut said in a university 
press release, “You’re left to 
wonder — is it that unhappy 
people are using social media, 
or is social media affecting 
happiness?”
As opposed to previous 
studies, which used user sur-
veys, Burke and Kraut’s study 
used Facebook logs to exam-
ine real activity over a period 
of months. 
The 1,910 participants of 
the study were all volunteers 
from across 91 countries, and 
their information was ana-
lyzed aggregately as opposed 
to individually.
Using the logs, which are 
more accurate than user sur-
veys, Burke and Kraut could 
differentiate between different 
types of activity on Facebook, 
including posts, passive read-
ing, liking, and commenting. 
The researchers could 
also determine whether 
the activity was associated 
with a user’s close friend or 
mere acquaintance.
“It turns out that when you 
talk with a little more depth 
on Facebook to people you 
already like, you feel better,” 
Kraut said. “That also happens 
when people talk in person.”
“This suggests that people 
who are feeling down may in-
deed spend more time on so-
cial media, but they choose to 
do so because they’ve learned 
it makes them feel better,” 
Burke said. “They’re reminded 
of the people they care about 
in their lives.”
The users of the study also 
took monthly surveys regard-
ing mood and behavior, and 
by considering these attri-
butes over time, Burke and 
Kraut were able to determine 
that personalized Facebook 
interactions predicted im-
provements in user psycho-
logical well-being, including 
an increase in satisfaction 
with life and happiness, as 
well as a decrease in loneliness 
and depression.
Since the participants of 
the study were all volunteers, 
there was no random assign-
ment involved, which, in a typ-
ical case, may cause invalida-
tion of the results. In addition, 
many of the participants were 
older and had larger networks 
than typical Facebook users. 
However, the study’s 
examination of social media 
interactions over time and 
psychological well-being sets 
up a research method that 
is more reliable than one-
time user surveys.
In the study’s abstract, the 
researchers say, “Speci?c uses 
of the site were associated 
with improvements in well-
being: Receiving targeted, 
composed communication 
from strong ties was associat-
ed with improvements in well-
being while viewing friends’ 
wide-audience broadcasts 
and receiving one-click feed-
back were not. These results 
suggest that people derive 
bene?ts from online commu-
nication, as long it comes from 
people they care about and 
has been tailored for them.”
In the study’s discussion, 
they say, “Our research derived 
predictions from ?ve comple-
mentary theories about how 
social interaction on Facebook 
should affect changes in indi-
viduals’ psychological well-
being. It provides evidence 
that the effects depend on the 
nature of the communication 
and the relationship between 
communicators. Receiving 
more personalized communi-
cation—targeted, composed 
text—from strong ties was 
linked to improvements in 
well-being.”
In the study’s conclusion, 
they say, “Speci?c uses of the 
site were associated with im-
provements in well-being: 
Receiving targeted, com-
posed communication from 
strong ties was associated 
with improvements in well-
being while viewing friends’ 
wide-audience broadcasts 
and receiving one-click feed-
back were not. These results 
suggest that people derive 
bene?ts from online commu-
nication, as long it comes from 
people they care about and 
has been tailored for them.”
Getting personalized 
messages makes us feel like 
someone out there cares, and 
whether that happens in per-
son or on social media, the ef-
fect is the same. 
So next time you’re scroll-
ing through Facebook, make 
sure to drop an encouraging 
comment on your friend’s 
page. It can go a long way.

Quantum leaps
NAVIYA SINGLA
Assistant SciTech Editor
Often referred to as the 
future of computing, quan-
tum computing is based on 
exploiting the laws of quan-
tum mechanics to transfer 
information using ‘qubits’. At 
the International Conference 
on Quantum Cryptography 
(QCrypt), held on Sept. 12, 
at the Carnegie Institution 
for Science in Washington, 
D.C., several research teams 
presented their ?ndings in the 
?eld of quantum computing.
Qubits, or quantum bits, 
are the smallest unit of infor-
mation in a quantum com-
puter. They store data that 
is traditionally binary in the 
form of two distinguishable 
quantum states.
The general principle be-
hind storing information is 
that these quantum bits have 
properties like superposition 
and entanglement. Superpo-
sition is the ability of these 
qubits to have more than a 
single state at the same time, 
which means that, in the case 
of an electron, it is possible for 
it to be in the ‘up’ and ‘down’ 
state at once. Entanglement is 
the inexplicable phenomenon 
of quantum particles to be in 
‘sync’ with each other, even at 
great distances.
However, the existence of 
a fully functional quantum 
computer is still years away. 
This is because of the fact that 
it is a signi?cant challenge to 
make qubits behave in a cer-
tain way when even the slight-
est disturbance causes qubits 
to fall out of their state. 
Another concern is that 
even though they have en-
tanglement states at larger 
distances, those distances are 
?nite and information needs 
to be repeated after some 
threshold value when using 
physical transfer methods. In 
free space, less information is 
lost, scattered, or absorbed.
A group of researchers 
from the University of Cal-
gary in Canada reported that 
they had transferred quantum 
states successfully over a dis-
tance of 6.2 km using three 
spaced out stations — A, B, 
and C — to send states from 
A to C using the Calgary ?ber 
network. One of the interest-
ing things that the report 
notes is that, even though they 
send disembodied quantum 
states from A to B, B doesn’t 
receive any physical particle, 
but still sends out photons in 
entanglement states.
Another team reports the 
construction of a 30 km op-
tical ?ber-based quantum 
network distributed over a 
12.5 km area in the city of 
Hefei, China. According to 
the report, the network is as 
completely robust in the real 
world scenario and employed 
stabilization strategies.
Both of these ?ndings were 
published in Nature Photonics 
on Sept. 19.
A research team from the 
Delft University of Technology 
in the Netherlands developed 
a system of quantum memory 
using quantum entanglement 
of electrons in diamond chips. 
Moving the entanglement of 
electrons to atomic nuclei pro-
tects the states, which is a rule 
that could potentially be used 
to expand the range of quan-
tum networks, according to a 
scientist on the team.
As research teams contin-
ue to work on quantum com-
puting, they ?nd better ways 
to control quantum bits and 
make stronger, larger, more 
functional quantum networks.
Quantum computing 
could revolutionize comput-
ing simply because it is so 
much faster than traditional 
methods. One way to think 
about this is that factoring 
large numbers, which is one 
of the slowest calculations 
that traditional computers do, 
could be done in a signi?cant-
ly shorter, more feasible time.
Furthermore, entangle-
ment allows researchers to 
know when the data is being 
modi?ed or accessed, because 
tweaking a qubit allows an-
other that is far away to also 
change, which security sys-
tems can catch unauthorized 
access. Thus, another bene?t 
of quantum computing is that 
it allows for better security of 
data transfer.
PUGWASH
Wearable technology takes over data, privacy, lives
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Layout Manager
Wearable technology 
adds a level of convenience 
to life which people have 
never had before. 
Objects like Fitbits and 
smartwatches allow people 
to have all the computing 
power packed into smart-
phones and laptops without 
ever having to reach into 
their pockets. 
This advantage  can even 
extend beyond wearables. 
Companies like John Dew-
ere have smart tractors that 
collect data from a farmer’s 
daily activities. 
Such objects combined 
are called the “Internet of 
Things,” (IoT) - the network 
of everyday objects with 
internet connectivity.
However, the IoT comes 
at a cost. A Fitbit is able to 
track a user’s location and 
other portable technolo-
gies can track things like 
search history. 
This transfer of data 
comes with some risks to 
users that are not immedi-
ately obvious. Other tech-
nology becomes so invasive 
or necessary that we ei-
ther ignore or cannot react 
to potential hazards.
One of the first things 
that always gets mentioned 
when our ubiquitous tech-
nology comes up is that we 
are losing our humanity to 
the tech. 
This concern haunts a 
lot of people but it never 
really exits the realm of 
sleepover philosophy. 
Maybe smartphones are 
slowly eating away at our 
free will, but they also cre-
ate so many possibilities that 
they completely overwhelm 
that sentiment. 
Our technology doesn’t 
control us, we control our 
technology and the tool 
becomes a constant in 
our lives. 
Whether or not 
this creates some sort of 
murkiness where we end 
and where the phone be-
gins is not a major con-
cern in the continued cre-
ation and use of internet 
connected objects
A more pressing concern 
is how much power over 
our daily activities we are 
relinquishing to companies. 
The IoT relies on inter-
net connectivity, meaning 
it relies on the support of 
its applications. 
When Nest, an Alphabet 
subsidiary, shut down its 
smarthome hub, the object 
became useless. 
This shows that 
companies have the power 
to discontinue a network 
reliant device immediately, 
but they can also take indi-
vidual users off of a device. 
If a company does not 
like how you use their prod-
uct, they can now take it 
away from you. 
If you sit on a chair back-
wards, you’re using it wrong, 
but the chair company can-
not restrict your access. This 
power gives companies a lot 
of influence over exactly how 
their product is used which 
could have unforeseen con-
sequences.
Furthermore, data 
privacy could be a 
significant concern. 
Almost no one reads the 
terms of agreement when 
they begin to use a new piece 
of software. This causes 
problems now, but when the 
data you turn over becomes 
exponentially larger, there 
are more opportunities for 
this to be destructive. 
Also, the company begins 
to own data that you creat-
ed, but don’t have access to. 
Those aforementioned 
John Deere tractors col-
lected data and sold it to 
third parties without the 
knowledge or consent 
of the farmers. 
The information might 
not have been personal, but 
the farmer put the labor into 
collecting that data and saw 
no return from its sale. 
This doesn’t even consid-
er the possibility of hacking.  
If someone steals your IoT 
data with malicious intent, 
it could open everything 
from your bank account to 
your house to attacks. 
Even items like 
pacemakers, which will kill 
people if they fail to operate 
reliably and correctly, could 
be targeted by hackers.
The IoT could be the most 
important technological de-
velopment of our lives, but 
we have to be careful going 
forward to make sure that it 
is a force for good and not 
a necessity that leaves us 
vulnerable.

JOSH ANDAH
Junior Staffwriter
Nine years ago, at a key-
note address, an excited Steve 
Jobs unveiled his company’s 
latest invention to the world 
— a black and silver, rectan-
gular, touch-screen phone. 
That device, called the iPhone, 
revolutionized the personal 
computing market. 
Today, touch-screen tech-
nology is indispensable. Peo-
ple use it to check their mail, 
swipe through holiday photos, 
scroll past endless sel?es on 
Instagram, and catch Poké-
mon. 
But, how does it actually 
work? How does a glass screen 
respond to touch and make 
the device perform?
There are many different 
types of touch-screens. 
The technology varies 
between devices and manu-
facturers, and many factors 
ultimately determine which 
version is chosen. 
Nevertheless, they all de-
tect the same thing: user stim-
ulus. 
There are three main types 
of touch screens: capacitive, 
resistive, and super acoustic. 
This article discusses capaci-
tive touch screens, because 
that is what almost all main-
stream smartphones use.
The uppermost surface of 
a capacitive touch screen is 
made of an insulating mate-
rial, such as glass. 
This glass surface is coated 
with a thin layer of a trans-
parent conductor. An electric 
charge is stored in this con-
ductor, establishing an elec-
trostatic ?eld across the sur-
face.
Unlike those in a circuit, 
the electrons supplied to the 
screen have nowhere to ?ow. 
The difference in this electric 
potential energy, which makes 
electrons ?ow from one loca-
tion to another, is called elec-
tric potential difference. 
These electrons build up, 
creating stored charge across 
the display. 
When a user touches the 
screen, the amassed electrons 
?nally have a place to ?ow to 
— the ?nger. 
The ?nger reduces the 
charge at that point on the 
screen, and so the charge and 
capacitance — the ratio of 
charge to potential difference 
— at that point are reduced 
to lower than the rest of the 
screen. 
These charges are very 
small, which is why you are not 
jolted with a shock whenever 
you interact with your phone, 
which would be extremely in-
convenient and detract from 
the user’s experience.
Circuits along the edges of 
the touch screen detect these 
minute differences in capaci-
tance and pinpoint their loca-
tions in xy coordinates. 
The information is sent to 
a processor, which interprets 
the user’s touch as a speci?c 
command.
Touch screens speci?-
cally work with ?ngers and 
skin because the human body 
conducts electricity, which is 
why when your phone is in 
your pocket the touch screen 
is not reacting to your every 
movement.
In addition, as you have 
probably noticed, it is much 
more dif?cult to use your 
phone with gloves on. 
The fabrics gloves are 
made of are usually insula-
tors, so they draw no charge 
off the screen and no touch 
is detected. However, special 
gloves are sold with      mate-
rial to help conduct electricity.
Touch screens provide nu-
merous bene?ts to the produc-
er and the consumer. 
Most noticeably, they elim-
inate the need for buttons. 
Buttons are easily damaged 
or jammed, and they reduce 
the waterproof capabilities of 
a device. 
Fewer buttons allow more 
space for large displays, which 
are crucial aspects of the user 
experience. 
Most importantly, touch 
screens allow users to interact 
naturally with the user inter-
face (think pinch-to-zoom, 
swiping, scrolling, and 3D 
Touch), improving device us-
ability drastically.
Touch technology has 
come a long way since 2007, 
and is continuously evolving. 
Today, researchers at Carn-
egie Mellon are developing 
EM-Sense, a technology that 
lets a user’s smartwatch know 
what object they are touching 
or holding, which could cre-
ate a new era of context aware 
apps.
 The Future Interfaces 
Group (FIG) of the Human-
Computer Interactions Insti-
tute has developed SkinTrack. 
SkinTrack turns the arm 
into an extended touch screen 
and allows the user to use the 
human body as a touch screen.
In the future, as science 
aims to make human and ma-
chine interaction more natu-
ral, touch screens will require 
minimum screen ‘touch.’ 
It could be replaced by ges-
ture tracking, voice recogni-
tion, etc., evident by Google 
ATAP’s Project Soli, which 
uses a miniature radar system, 
built into a smartwatch to 
track touchless gestures. 
Touch screen technology 
has changed the way we in-
teract with technology for the 
better, and continues to de?ne 
and enrich the interaction of 
people and machines. 
But most importantly, the 
next time you pull out your 
phone and swipe to unlock, 
you’ll know how it all works.

FANTASY, from A12
Minaj And Co. over Team 
Foley 136–101
Tayal took control of his 
team, gave it a name, and 
managed to dominate against 
last week’s highest scoring 
loser in Foley’s second team. 
For Tayal, Oakland Raiders 
running back Latavius Mur-
ray, Cleveland Browns run-
ning back Isaiah Crowell, 
Falcons wide receiver Julio 
Jones, and Miami Dolphins 
wide receiver Jarvis Landry 
each contributed 21 points, 
already enough to beat Foley’s 
team. Foley, like some of the 
other losers this week, had a 
player get injured: Panthers 
running back Jonathan Stew-
art. She’ll need to shuf?e her 
team’s players if she wants to 
start winning (though in fair-
ness, she would have beaten 
any other team week one be-
sides India’s team). Tayal’s 
Minaj And Co. are now 1–1, 
while Team Foley falls to 0–2.
Team Foley over Plaidie 
Daddies 101–87
In a reversal of last week, 
Tayal’s ?rst team defeated In-
dia’s team. Foley has the Car-
dinals to thank, as their domi-
nant performance against 
the Buccaneers gave her a 
24-point performance from 
quarterback Carson Palmer 
and a 22-point showing from 
the defense. One thing Foley 
should note going forward is 
Vikings wide receiver Stefon 
Diggs. 
After scoring 17 points 
in week one and 33 points 
in week two, he probably 
shouldn’t be on her bench. On 
Price’s side, the same team 
that got her 144 points last 
week only scored 87 points 
this week. Pittsburgh Steel-
ers running back DeAngelo 
Williams, Titans tight end 
Delanie Walker, and Broncos 
running back C.J. Anderson 
were her top contributors, but 
her laggards sunk her chances 
of victory. 
Steelers kicker Shaun Su-
isham earned her no points 
since he was injured, and she 
needs to replace him ASAP. 
The Raiders defense is a ter-
rible unit: scoring negative 
points for the second week in 
a row. Admittedly, they have a 
matchup this week that keeps 
them tolerable, but she needs 
to drop them for another de-
fense as well. 
Cincinnati Bengals wide 
receiver A.J. Green will not 
be held to single digit perfor-
mances every week, so his 
weak performance against 
the Steelers is nothing for 
Price to worry about. She 
should, however, consider 
benching Broncos wide re-
ceiver Emmanuel Sanders 
in favor of Baltimore Ravens 
wide receiver Mike Wallace, 
who scored 19 points in week 
one and 20 points in week 
two. Price has the pieces for 
a good team, but she needs to 
make some moves in order to 
win consistently. Both teams 
are now 1–1.
Heading into week three, 
Rosenberg’s team and 
Crockem’s team are both 
2–0. Rosenberg’s team seems 
poised to ascend further, af-
ter stealing Chargers running 
back Melvin Gordon from 
Tayal’s team in exchange for 
Ware. However, Wood’s team 
is poised to signi?cantly chal-
lenge Rosenberg, especially 
after picking up Seattle Se-
ahawks running back Chris-
tine Michael. The matchup 
between two of the strongest 
teams should prove to be in-
teresting.
Elsewhere, I’m fairly cer-
tain I won’t be writing next 
week’s article. I’ve added Jets 
wide receiver Quincy Enunwa 
and Chargers wide receiver 
Tyrell Williams to my roster. 
Of course, Beresford is still 
in it against me after picking 
up Chargers quarterback 
Phillip Rivers, but she hasn’t 
yet slotted anyone to replace 
Peterson on her team.
Foley’s second team got 
up to a 24–0 lead over Sar-
ah’s team after the Patri-
ots defense eliminated the 
need to overexert tight end 
Rob Gronkowski’s return to 
the ?eld. Still, Indianapolis 
Colts quarterback Andrew 
Luck is questionable to play, 
Chargers tight end Antonio 
Gates is questionable, and 
Stewart is out. Since Foley 
doesn’t look like she’s going 
to make changes at all and 
Gutekunst’s starters are all 
completely healthy, I suspect 
that Gutekunst will mount a 
comeback. Price’s team got 
off to a 14–0 lead over Crock-
em’s team, and she is pro-
jected to win her matchup by 
nine points. Of course, things 
would be better for India if 
she changed her defense and 
kicker, but things might still 
be ?ne for this week.
Lastly, Tayal’s team is 
poised to win against Foley’s 
?rst team, especially since 
Bills head coach Rex Ryan 
believes “odds probably not 
real good that [wide receiver 
Sammy Watkins] plays.” If 
Foley were to slot in Diggs 
for Watkins, she would be 
more likely to win over Tayal’s 
team.It’s hard to tell where 
most of these teams will be 
headed in the future. While 
Rosenberg and Wood are 
both clearly poised for win-
ning, other teams have murk-
ier fates. I would say that 
Gutekunst, Price, and I have 
some of the better teams, but 
that would discount Tayal’s 
week two performance and 
Foley’s two teams. Crockem 
may be 2–0, but that re-
cord isn’t nearly as solid as 
Rosenberg’s. Beresford is in 
the most danger since she 
doesn’t have anyone lined up 
who can replace Peterson’s 
production at running back. 
Still, it is entirely too early to 
call  game over for anyone.
Football
The Carnegie Mellon foot-
ball team traveled to Thomas 
More College on Saturday and 
fell to the 18th-ranked home 
team, 20–16. Thomas More 
scored 13 points in the ?rst 
quarter, and the scoring went 
unanswered by the Tartans 
until a ?eld goal in the second 
quarter. Thomas More scored 
another touchdown in the 
third, and the Tartans tried 
to come back but could only 
manage two ?eld goals in the 
?nal quarter of the game. Tar-
tan quarterback sophomore 
Alex Cline had 242 passing 
yards on the day along with 
one touchdown, but he threw 
four interceptions that proved 
very problematic. Star run-
ning back junior Sam Benger 
could not produce his nor-
mal level of success and ?n-
ished the game with only 55 
rushing yards. Juniors John 
Prather and Tommy Mans?eld 
led the receiving core for the 
Tartans with 71 and 73 yards, 
respectively.
Defensively, the Tartans 
showed promise but could 
not sti?e the Thomas More of-
fense well enough to get the 
win. Senior Aaryn Watson and 
junior Kyle Brittain stepped up 
in the secondary and both had 
an interception. In the trench-
es, seniors Ben Winebrake and 
Jack Fagan each recorded a 
sack. Senior Samer Abdelmoty 
and junior Stanley Bikulege 
each had a career-best 12 
tackles on the day.
This loss puts the Tartans 
at 1–2 for the season, but they 
will look to get their second 
win next week when they play 
on home turf as they take on 
Bethany College. The game 
will take place on Saturday, 
Oct. 1 at 6 p.m.
Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team traveled to Grove 
City College on Friday and suf-
fered their ?rst loss of the sea-
son, 2–1. The Tartans scored 
?rst in the 21st minute with a 
goal from sophomore Anthony 
Gulli for his second of the sea-
son. Grove City tied the match 
at 1–1 in the 39th minute. The 
Tartans kept putting shots on 
goal in the second half, but the 
Wolverine defense proved to 
be too much. The Tartans gave 
Grove City the lead in the 85th 
minute with an own goal and 
the game ended soon after 
with the Tartans falling for the 
?rst time this season.
The Tartans will take the 
?eld again on Saturday, Oct. 
1 at home against Brandeis 
University as they try to get 
back to their winning ways. 
The game is scheduled to start 
at 1:30 p.m.
Women’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s tennis team be-
gan the United States Tennis 
Association-Intercollegiate 
Tennis Association (USTA-
ITA) Regional Championships 
on Saturday. Four Tartans 
advanced to the round of 16, 
and one doubles pair moved 
on to quarter?nals. Senior 
Nicholle Torres moved on in 
singles play after winning 
both matches, along with ju-
nior teammates Cori Siddell 
and Katie Lai who also swept 
their matches on the day. 
Sophomore Jamie Vizelman 
also advanced in singles play 
for the Tartans, and the pair of 
Torres and Siddel advanced in 
doubles. The tournament runs 
through Monday.

Tartan volleyball sweeps home tournament with four wins
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s volleyball team took the 
court in Skibo Gymnasium this 
weekend to compete in the 
Carnegie Mellon DoubleTree 
Invitational. The host Tartans 
dominated the tournament, 
winning all four matches. On 
Friday, the Tartans took down 
Bethany College with a score 
of 3–0 and moved on to defeat 
Randolph-Macon College 3–1 
for an impressive opening day 
of the tournament.
In the ?rst match against 
Bethany, the Tartans shut 
out their opponent, winning 
the ?rst 25–20, the second 
26–24, and the third and ?nal 
set 25–13. Senior setter Emily 
Newton led the Tartan of-
fense in the ?rst match with 
39 assists, along with senior 
middle blocker Jackie Gibbons 
who had 12 kills. Sophomore 
right setter Sarah Jurgens 
and junior middle blocker 
Eliza Donahue each ?nished 
the match with zero errors; 
Jurgens secured nine kills, 
while Donahue earned seven 
of her own. Donahue, Newton, 
and Gibbons each had two 
block assists on top of their of-
fensive performances. Senior 
libero and defensive specialist 
Molly Higgins anchored the 
defensive side for the Tartans 
with 16 digs in the match.
The second match on 
Friday was not a complete 
shutout, but the Tartans 
proved themselves with a de-
cisive 3–1 victory. Carnegie 
Mellon dropped the ?rst set 
against Randolph-Macon Col-
lege 25–21, but surged back 
to take the next three sets, 
each with a score of 25–19. 
The Tartans forced the Yellow 
Jackets to make too many mis-
takes and fall behind in each 
set. Gibbons found herself at 
the top of the offensive lead-
erboards again in the second 
match with 11 kills. Donahue 
had another strong perfor-
mance with nine kills, while 
sophomore outside hitter Lau-
ren Mueller contributed eight 
of her own. Newton had 33 
assists in the second match to 
lead the team once again. 
Carnegie Mellon’s defense 
had an impressive showing in 
this match, with Higgins lead-
ing once again with 27 digs. 
Mueller earned 17 digs as 
well. Donohue had nine block 
assists in this match, and ju-
nior Heather Holton had ?ve.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
closed the tournament with 
two matches against the Uni-
versity of Mount Union and 
John Carroll University and 
won both, 3–0 and 3–1, re-
spectively. The four victories 
from this tournament put the 
No. 17 Tartans’ overall record 
at 15–2 for the season.
In the ?rst match against 
Mount Union, Carnegie 
Mellon swept their opponent 
with set scores of 25–19, 25–
20, and 25–14. The Tartans 
recorded their highest hitting 
percentage of the season in 
this match at .402 along with 
only six errors in the entire 
game. Gibbons and Newton 
continued their precedent 
of leading the offense in the 
match. Gibbons earned 13 
kills and no errors on top of a 
.812 hitting percentage, while 
Newton had 39 assists. Jur-
gens showed up with another 
strong performance in this 
match with nine kills, along 
with Mueller who had seven.
On the defensive side, Hig-
gins earned 14 digs for the 
Tartans, while Gibbons and 
Newton each had four block 
assists. Donahue had two 
block assists of her own, along 
with three solo blocks.
The ?nal match of the tour-
nament against John Carroll 
University was another con-
vincing victory for the Tartan 
squad. The Tartans did drop 
a set, but won the match 3–1 
with some of their best per-
formances of the tournament. 
The Tartans won the ?rst set 
25–23 before falling in the sec-
ond, 28–26. The ?nal two sets 
went decisively in favor  of the 
Tartans, 25–16 and 25–18. 
The offensive leaders for 
the Tartans put up tourna-
ment-best numbers with 
Newton earning 50 assists, 
while Gibbons recorded 19 
kills, which is also a career 
high for her. Mueller and 
Holton also had impressive 
performances as Mueller 
earned 14 kills and Holton had 
11 for the match.
Defensively, Higgins put 
32 digs on the board to close 
out the tournament. First-year 
outside hitter and defensive 
specialist Kayla Yew recorded 
a career-best with 23 digs of 
her own, and Donahue had 
three block assists on top of 
two solo blocks. Gibbons also 
had two solo blocks and two 
block assists to cap the unde-
feated tournament.
The Tartans will now move 
on to University Athletic Asso-
ciation (UAA) play, which be-
gins next week on their home 
turf as they take on rival Wash-
ington University in St. Louis 
on Saturday, Oct. 1 at noon 
in the Skibo Gymnasium. The 
Tartans will surely be ready.

A quick note regarding 
this column. Pillbox Editor 
Abhishek Tayal was supposed 
to write last week’s article 
because of being week one’s 
worst loser, but extenuating 
circumstances prevented him 
from doing so. Layout Man-
ager Zeke Rosenberg has as-
sured me that he has been or 
will be properly punished, so 
I’ll let bygones be bygones. In 
the future, expect the worst 
loser of the week to write 
the article, and week two’s 
biggest loser was me.
A quick recap of week one. 
Lula Beresford escaped the 
ignominy of being week one’s 
worst loser because Tayal 
started a suspended player. 
Jade Crockem changed her 
team’s name to complete the 
pun as mentioned in the ar-
ticle I wrote two weeks ago, 
and that’s totally the reason 
she won. Rosenberg, Sports 
Editor Alex Wood, and I all 
won our matchups by com-
fortable margins. Strangely, 
Forum Editor Sinead Foley’s 
second team, which I thought 
would be weak, scored 141 
points. Unfortunately for her, 
the team faced Online Editor 
India Price’s Plaidie Daddies, 
coming from behind on Mon-
day night to total 144 points. 
Price totally won week one in 
the only matchup that came 
down to a single digit differ-
ence. Now to recap week two.
Flaming Bears over 
Dreamland Warriors 123–7
As expected Rosenberg 
totally trounced my team. 
He picked up Atlanta Falcons 
quarterback Matt Ryan, Kan-
sas City Chiefs running back 
Spencer Ware, and Dallas 
Cowboys wide receiver Cole 
Beasley, actively playing week 
one’s waiver wire. Carolina 
Panthers tight end Greg Ol-
sen, Tennessee Titans running 
back DeMarco Murray, and 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide 
receiver Mike Evans led his 
team to victory. On my end, 
the New York Giants were able 
to greatly limit the offense of 
the New Orleans Saints, caus-
ing quarterback Drew Brees 
and tight end Coby Fleener to 
severely underperform. Los-
ing San Diego Chargers wide 
receiver Keenan Allen for the 
year after week one did not 
help my team at all. Giants 
wide receiver Odell Beckham, 
Arizona Cardinals wide re-
ceiver Larry Fitzgerald, and 
Buffalo Bills running back 
LeSean McCoy were my star 
players. New England Patriots 
tight end Martellus Bennett 
taunted me from the bench 
with a 22-point performance, 
but that would not have 
been nearly enough to defeat 
Rosenberg’s team. The Flam-
ing Bears are now 2–0, while 
my Dreamland Warriors fall 
to 1–1.
Mr. Rodgers’ Neighbor-
hood over Masshole 
Knickerbockers 96–86
See, Jade. That pun is to-
tally the reason your team is 
2–0 right now. Actually, the 
real reason is because inju-
ries destroyed Beresford’s 
team. Chicago Bears quar-
terback Jay Cutler left the 
game after giving Beresford 
a mere two points, but the 
more devastating injury hap-
pened to Minnesota Vikings 
running back Adrian Peter-
son. I’m really glad I didn’t 
pick him in the draft because 
he’s now on injured reserve, 
meaning he won’t be able to 
help Beresford at all unless 
she somehow ?nds herself in 
the championship matchup. 
Strong performances by Caro-
lina Panthers kicker Graham 
Gano (18 points from a kick-
er!), New York Jets wide re-
ceiver Brandon Marshall, and 
the Houston Texans defense 
were not enough to overcome 
performances from Green 
Bay Packers quarterback 
Aaron Rodgers, Cowboys 
running back Ezekiel Elliott, 
Denver Broncos wide receiver 
Demaryius Thomas, and the 
Panther defense. Beresford’s 
team falls to 0–2, facing an 
uncertain future.
McManus’s Anus over 
extremely dank team 
155–93
Publisher Sarah Gutekunst 
absolutely destroyed Wood’s 
team. Jets running back Matt 
Forte, Jets wide receiver Eric 
Decker, Panthers wide receiv-
er Kelvin Benjamin, and the 
Broncos defense each con-
tributed over 20 points, with 
Forte adding a massive 30 
points. The previously-named 
Broncos kicker Brandon Mc-
Manus had a strong 14-point 
showing that helped give 
Gutekunst’s team the highest 
single game point total thus 
far in the season. For Wood, 
Panthers quarterback Cam 
Newton did the team proud, 
but when his passes were 
largely going to Benjamin, the 
29 points he amassed were 
completely neutralized. Cow-
boys wide receiver Dez Bryant 
was the only other player to 
score double digits for Wood. 
The news only got worse. 
Chargers running back Danny 
Woodhead suffered an ACL 
injury that took him out for 
the season. I had him pegged 
as a potentially great contrib-
uter for Wood’s team, but now 
he’ll have to forge ahead with-
out the dual running and re-
ceiving threat. Both teams are 
now 1–1.

The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team faced 
off against Baldwin Wallace 
College on Tuesday, Sept. 
20. The Tartans defeated the 
home team Yellow Jackets 
2–0 in a convincing victory.
Carnegie Mellon applied 
heavy pressure to their oppo-
nents from the start, putting 
seven shots on goal early in 
the game. Despite the Tar-
tans’ aggression, the game 
remained scoreless until the 
37th minute. First-year for-
ward Sydney Webber assisted 
the goal with a corner kick, 
and from that corner kick 
?rst-year defender Camille 
Williams collected the ball 
and ?red a hard shot that con-
nected with the back of the 
net, earning her ?rst career 
score and putting the Tartans 
up 1–0 and ?nally capitalizing 
on their aggression.
Not only were the Tartans 
aggressive on offense, but 
their stout defense prohibited 
the Yellow Jackets from get-
ting anywhere near the goal. 
In the ?rst 18 minutes of the 
game, sophomore goalkeeper 
Sarah Mahler made three 
saves and effectively shut 
down any further attempt to 
score by the home team.
The second and ?nal goal 
of the game for the Tartans 
came in the 73rd minute, 
once again assisted by Web-
ber. First-year forward Vayda 
Farino scored the ?rst goal of 
her career off of Webber’s as-
sist, and that goal would end 
up securing the win for the 
Tartans. Junior forward Haili 
Adams attempted a shot with 
less than a minute left in the 
game, but a defender got in 
the way and the shot was de-
nied. Still the Tartans ended 
the game with two goals for 
themselves and a shut out 
for the other team, so they 
can be proud. This win marks 
Mahler’s second shut out of 
the season, as well as her 
fourth win.
On Friday Sept. 23, the 
Tartans traveled to Ohio to 
battle John Carroll Univer-
sity. The teams fought hard, 
and the Tartans looked to be 
in control for the whole game, 
but the match ended in a 1–1 
draw after overtime.
John Carroll struck ?rst 
early in the game, putting a 
shot past Mahler in the 14th 
minute. This mistake did 
not deter the Tartans at all 
though. They kept pushing 
toward the opposing goal, 
even making four shots on 
goal in the ?rst period only to 
be denied by the Blue Streaks 
goalkeeper every time.
The Tartans continued to 
send shots at the opposing 
goal, but nothing was con-
necting with the back of the 
net. The John Carroll goal-
keeper denied another four 
shots before the Tartans ?-
nally tied the game with their 
?rst score in the 84th minute. 
Adams stepped up for the 
Tartans and ?red a shot to the 
goal. It went past the John 
Carroll goalkeeper, a rare 
sight in this game, and the 
Tartans made the score 1–1.
The Tartans were persis-
tent in their attack for the rest 
of the game, but the opposing 
goalkeeper would not let an-
other score through. Junior 
mid?elder Tori Iatarola made 
two attempts to score in the 
?nal two minutes of the game 
but neither were success-
ful, and the teams went into 
overtime play.
In the overtime period, 
stellar goalkeeping by both 
teams kept the score at a 
standstill. Senior mid?elder 
Delaney Lam and junior for-
ward Sienna Stritter each 
made a shot on goal in over-
time, but Lam’s shot was 
saved by the John Carroll 
goalkeeper and Stritter’s was 
blocked by a defender.
First-year goalkeeper An-
drea Sipos earned the deci-
sion for the Tartans after she 
entered the game for Mahler 
in the 67th minute.
While they did not lose, the 
Tartans surely wanted more 
out of their performance. The 
opposing goalkeeper refused 
to let the Tartan offense get 
rolling and ended the game 
with 11 saves. This tie is the 
?rst of the season for the Tar-
tans, but next week they will 
look to get a solid victory as 
they host University Athletic 
Association (UAA) opponent 
Brandeis University on Sat-
urday, Oct. 1. The game is 
scheduled to start at 11 a.m.

Sarah Gutekunst | Publisheradvice for awkward people
on embracing your own furry self
Dear Sarah,
Normally it really bugs me that J. K. Rowling can’t shut 
up and just leave the Harry Potter series alone for 
Dumbledore’s sake, but last week I made an exception. She 
released the Patronus test, getting me where I’m weak: 
internet quizzes.
I had a near heart attack when I saw the buzz on Facebook. 
I scrambled to reset my Pottermore password (the neurons 
that housed that memory are long dead), then I answered 
each unnerving question with bated breath, oohing and 
ahhing at the on-point AF visuals. 
As I flew through the woods toward my result, I had good 
vibes. I knew I was going to be something amazing, like a 
unicorn or a snow leopard or a phoenix.
Except then I turned the final corner, and there I saw a rat. 
A. Rat. What am I supposed to make of this? Rowling didn’t 
even give descriptions!
Sure, I shared the Pizza Rat video with the caption “lol 
relatable,” but as far as I was concerned, pizza is the only 
thing I have in common with rats. Then I started reflecting. 
What if I really am a rat? I am kind of conniving and gossipy. 
It’s not like I’m a snitch, but I have spilled a few secrets. 
I love cheese more than almost any other food in the world. 
If I saw it on a neck-snapping device I would probably at 
least try to get a nibble. Also my hygiene could be better. 
I could cause a plague, who knows? Have I been living 
my life under the illusion that I’m a mystical creature, only 
to realize that I’m basically a bottom feeder? Is this what 
growing up is?
Fretfully,
Refusing to Accept The Results Of Negative Ugly Stuff
Dear Ratronus,
Rats get a bad rap. As a lifelong rodent advocate, I want us 
to dispel these myths, for your peace of mind, and for rats 
everywhere.
Science has exonerated rats in the spread of the plague, so 
you can forget that. Rats aren’t nearly as dirty as common 
perception leads us to believe.
As animals, they’re not quite as evil and villainous as we 
think they are either. Rats are very intelligent, playful, social 
animals that actually make wonderful companions. They 
can actually be trained to respond to their names! Just 
think of a tiny dog with a super long tail. Isn’t that better?
I, too, was frustrated with Rowling for not even taking the 
time to give us insight into what these obscure patronus 
results mean (I got vulture and was also offended), so I took 
to Google. Luckily, Quotev user Sixbhn wrote an article 
to make sense of this madness. In regards to rats, Sixbhn 
tells us, “Ambitious, social adaptable. Rat people tend to be 
creative, intelligent, impulsive and ostentatious.”
Those are pretty good traits. Nimbleness in all parts of life is 
an enviable strength!
But IRL, internet quizzes are super fun trash. Remember 
this. Sure, it’s fun to learn more about the you that the 
quiz perceives you to be, but keep in mind that they are 
absolutely made up. Maybe even worse than horoscopes. 
You could probably take the test a different day and get an 
entirely different result.
The only test that decides who you are is the test you 
take when you look at yourself in the mirror. If you see a 
phoenix, then be that phoenix.
All the love,
Sarah

India Price | Online EditorKanye’s double tap
A look into the artistic realism of Kanye West
When someone says Kanye West, what comes to mind? 
Visionary? Icon? Coolest man alive? We’d argue that 
all of those are correct. There isn’t anyone else more 
fascinating on this whole planet — don’t fight us on 
this. Which is why on Sept. 18 at exactly 8:23 a.m., when 
he finally made an Instagram and uploaded a picture, 
we were elated, to say the least. Kanye is a complex 
man and this picture could mean anything, but we’ve 
narrowed it down to three schools of thought.
 
One: He’s going to drop a surprise album called Lines. 
There are a lot of straight lines in the picture, so it only 
makes sense.
Two: It’s the beginning of his presidential campaign. 
The White House is his for the taking in 2020.
Three: North took the picture when they accidentally 
left her somewhere ... again.
If you love Kanye as much as Kanye loves Kanye, then 
you know that Kanye loves being mysteriously deep for 
seemingly no reason at all. So it only makes sense that 
he would make his Instagram debut with a screenshot 
of a dramatic scene from a sci-fi flick circa 1990 — Total 
Recall. We must admit, we did do a little research on 
this movie to uncover what sort of motives Kanye 
might have for posting the photo. Maybe he’s trying 
to let us know that he’s calling a total recall on The Life 
of Pablo as a means of making way for a surprise new 
album. And maybe this surprise new album will echo 
the futuristic vibe of Total Recall.  Maybe (hopefully) 
he’s calling a total recall on Yeezy Season 4, because 
truthfully we’re not sure how many more ripped 
sweaters in various shades of nude and army green we 
can handle. 
Next is the very real possibility that Kanye West will 
run for President of the United States in 2020, because 
apparently anybody is allowed to run nowadays. 
Kanye’s Oval Office plans date back to the 2015 VMA’s 
when he himself declared that “[he has decided] 
in 2020 to run for president.” Perhaps Instagram 
presented itself to ‘Ye as another way for him to gain 
momentum as a legitimate candidate. Although it’s 
going to take him a while to match Kim’s 83.3 million 
followers, Kanye’s leap to over 1 million Instagram 
followers in just under five days is nothing to laugh 
at. But the question still persists, why the Total Recall 
reference? Let’s just hope he got consent to use the 
photo before Kim has to take to Twitter to defend Ye’s 
honor via Snapchat video.
Unsurprisingly, this isn’t the first time we’ve been 
confused by the Instagram usage of the West Family. 
Throwback to late last year when young North West 
was accused of posting a very flattering picture of Kim 
while playing games on her mom’s phone. She seems 
to be very tech-savvy for such a young age. Could we 
possibly be looking out for her application to Carnegie 
Mellon School of Computer Science someday? Is North 
the culprit in this latest blunder? Can we expect an 
Instagram account from her next? Will Kanye soon shift 
the blame onto his young daughter? Only time will tell.
There are a number of reasons that Kanye could’ve 
chosen this picture as his inaugural Instagram post. 
After weighing the above options and exploring all of 
the various camps in this argument, we feel that we 
have reached the only logical conclusion. Judging from 
the obscure choice in photo, lack of profile picture, and 
absence of a caption, we have concluded that Kanye 
West might just not know how to use Instagram.

Punk rock’s not dead. In fact, punk rock 
is very much alive. At the Roboto Punk 
Rock Flea Market on Saturday, Sept. 24, 
a handful of local vendors and people 
looking to sell their vintage items gath-
ered to promote themselves and the 
scene.
The Mr. Roboto Project, a music venue 
in Bloomfield, brought back the mar-
ket after a year-long hiatus. Before, the 
market was held every couple months, 
but it has recently resurfaced, featuring 
not only the best of the scene but also 
small artistic highlights of Pittsburgh as 
well.
Local artist Carly Casey sold her unique 
woven dreamcatchers and banners to 
the Flea Market. She also sold her prints 
and patches that blended right in to the 
underground, vintage vibe of the Mr. 
Roboto Project and the Punk Rock Flea 
Market.
People from all over Pittsburgh gath-
ered to sell their wares, including old 
clocks, classic cassettes, Green Day 
CDs, comics as recent as Ms. Marvel, 
and as classic as Brian Michael Bendis’ 
run of Daredevil, and even a Nintendo 
Gamecube featuring Super Smash Bros. 
Melee, which was left on for visitors 
to play with and compete against each 
other. 
Punky Comics and Scumball Co. also 
featured their art at the Flea Market. 
Punky Comics sells a variety of prod-
ucts featuring their original art, such as 
stickers and zines as well as originally 
curated cassettes and vinyl. Their zines 
feature their original art highlighting the 
best and the weird of the alternative 
culture of Pittsburgh. Scumball Co. also 
specializes in weird and cool designs, 
selling their own shirts and stickers.
To compliment the vintage vibe of the 
Flea Market, The Black Cat Market sold 
their original blend of coffee, Grounds 
and Hounds Coffee, and Three Rivers 
Tea Company tea, along with their own 
mugs, sleeves, stickers, and buttons to 
promote the café’s opening this fall. The 
Black Cat Market will be Pittsburgh’s 
first cat café, where they will serve cof-
fee and bring cats for visitors to play 
with. The Black Cat Market also sold 
their own vegan sugar cookies, a sam-
pling of the treats the café will have to 
offer when it opens.
City Grows is an urban organic garden 
shop that featured their air plants, which 
are special kinds of plants that require 
extra care. The shop strives to integrate 
helping the earth in every aspect of their 
business, often recycling items or repur-
posing them for future use. Additionally, 
the shop only sells certified organic 
plants and products.
The Mr. Roboto Project also sold their 
own merchandise outside the market, 
and participated in the flea market by 
selling other bands’ shirts, records, and 
spools of ribbon for $1 each.
At the Mr. Roboto Punk Rock Flea 
Market, the community truly came 
together to learn about and celebrate 
the scene. The scene never dies; rather 
it evolves, and has brought along sev-
eral different aspects of what makes 
Pittsburgh great.

How I’ve met people over the past few 
weeks: Often times, the other person 
will start off the conversation with: 
“Hey! You’re in my (insert course name) 
class, right?” 
“Do I know you from somewhere? I think 
we met at Playfair or something.”
“Oooh you’re in (insert name of 
school)??? Me too!!!” 
Then follows: 
    
“So what’s your major?”
“Oh, I’m (insert name) by the way. And 
what’s your name?”
“Cool! Where are you staying? I live in 
Mudge.” 
    
(Because somehow 90 percent of the 
people I’ve met are from Mudge House). 
Introductions to new people in college 
have become predictable. I have no idea 
how exactly that came to be, but it just 
did. Whenever I meet a new person, the 
same topics or questions will come up. 
And after speaking with them, there’s 
usually a 50/50 chance that I’ll ever talk 
to or even see this person again. I’m not 
saying that the predictability is a bad 
thing; it’s actually made the whole pro-
cess of meeting people easier for me. I 
just find general introductions in college 
very weird. 
So far, introducing myself to new people 
has honestly been an easier introduc-
tion to give than other kinds. There’s this 
template that I can now follow for meet-
ing people on campus. On the other 
hand, for introductions to new areas, 
schedules, or classes (for example), I 
have to just hope for the best. I never 
know what to expect. Like this one 
time, when the buses stopped running 
in some part of Pittsburgh and I had to 
find another route back to campus. Or 
the times between classes where I use 
a different entrance into Doherty and I 
spend most of the ten minutes navigat-
ing the hallways to my find my lecture 
hall. 
As a new first year, you’ll find so many 
instances where you’ll have to think fast 
and act. We’re often thrown into taking 
risks and stepping out of our comfort 
zones, which may make the entire col-
lege experience for us weird at the 
moment. 
Back in high school I was so accustomed 
to the much smaller school commu-
nity, where I knew every student and 
teacher’s name. Taking risks seemed 
to be much easier in that environment 
because I could easily find some-
one, whom I knew well, to help me if 
necessary. 
After coming to Carnegie Mellon, which 
has an undergraduate population of 
about 6,000 students, I’ve found it a bit 
harder to find people I know who would 
help me if I needed it. I don’t know 
many people in general at the moment 
anyway. But that’s where my “introduc-
ing myself to new people” template 
comes in handy. 
No matter what stage in 
life, introductions will always be hard to 
deal with. They force people to encoun-
ter unknown areas, during both conve-
nient and the most inconvenient times. 
But it’s after getting through the intro-
ductions where you can find the most 
rewarding things. As a first year who still 
needs to become accustomed to the 
Carnegie Mellon community, I know for 
a fact that there’s a lot to look forward 
to. Even though I may feel weird now, 
I’ll eventually get to that point where I’ll 
start to feel more at home.

Theodore Teichman | Visual Editor
“I’m sorry, sir. You can’t come in here with that camera.”
“I’m sorry? What?”
“I’m sorry. But the lens is too large” 
“Um, I’m sorry, but I’m supposed to be photograph-
ing this event. I’m a journalist,” (with an unreasonable 
amount of authority on the words): “...with The Tartan.”
“I’m sorry but you can’t come in here. You’re going to 
have to put that in your car” 
The voice of Lauren Mayberry, lead singer of 
CHVRCHES, rang over the the sounds of my protests 
to the gate guards.
My camera and I began our 1.5 mile walk back to the 
car from whence we came.
As I left, my three companions shuffled into the undu-
lating crowd and I trudged back through the shallow 
waves of people stumbling down the gravel road mak-
ing their way to the old Carrie Furnaces. The glowing 
rusted bastion of Pittsburgh industry glows now from 
the colored lights of the Thrival Music & Innovation 
Festival rather than the long-gone fires of the the 
Andrew Carnegie factory.
The glow permeated the air on my walk back. Dejected, 
I resolved that I wasn’t going to spend $60 to not hear 
anything. I tried my hardest to listen to the songs 
that were becoming increasingly distant. The pulsing 
basses and floaty vocals oozed through the rusted 
metal walls, through the humid air and gently stroked 
my cochlea. The sound is louder. Louder than it is. I’m 
walking away from the glow but the pulsing is now 
growing. It’s now infused with the buzzes of the cicadas 
lurking in the empty green. Filled with the echos of the 
people in the distance. At the festival. In their cars. On 
the bridge. In their little postcard houses perched like 
parakeets chattering in response to the ruckus below. 
The footsteps. Mine. The passing bands of event-
goers, passing ships. The beat set not by the musicians 
on stage but by us. Footsteps:
thudthudthud
thudthud
thud
thudthudthudthudthud
thud
thud 
thud
...
thudthudthud...
Lauren still sings but it’s haunting now. Slightly out of 
tune from the reverberations. It seems as though it is 
coming from the trees, the ghosts lurking there. The 
apparition poses the bodies of those brightly dressed, 
flower-crowned humans and they sing too. All slightly 
in different tunings, ricocheting off of each other with-
out meaning to.
I reach the bridge finally. 
It’s only a few more blocks to the car. 
I think. 
A car nearly hits me as I cross the first intersection on 
my way up the hill.
They yells something at me. 
I yell something back. 
And then walk a bit faster. 
Quite a bit.
The next street seems right. 
It wasn’t. 
Okay, so maybe the next one?
Also no.
I am back again on the original street.
I think.
 
Probably.
That church looks familiar.
All the churches look familiar.
I start to hear the sound of upbeat jazz. It’s coming from 
somewhere to my left. No, behind me. No, in front. It’s 
definitely up the hill in front of me. 
It’s now part of the Campbell’s Old Fashioned Vegetable 
Soup of sounds that are swarming through my head.
An exceptionally happenin’ Baptist church appears on 
the crest of the hill. 
I recognize it’s green and yellow stained glass windows 
with dark shadows from the people dancing within. We 
passed this on our way from the car the first time.
It’s now filled with a new kind of energy. It’s different 
from that of the music festival below, but somehow 
the same. I stop here for a bit, listening to the bounc-
ing guitar jumping over the drumbeats and slightly 
mistuned piano. The vocalist has a specific kind of con-
fidence in her voice. A kind of sound that is assured by 
the intimacy of the room. The feeling that everyone in 
there must already know each other. She is singing for 
friends and wants to tell them a story. I try to hear the 
story too, but it’s much harder on the outside. Everyone 
in there already knows the story. But they want to hear 
it again anyways. They want her to tell it to them. I know 
it well. Singing the self-made Karaoke of friends danc-
ing around the living room and squawking on make-
shift instruments. I can’t hear hear their song, and they 
can’t hear mine, we all have our own stories we sing 
and our own joyous crowds that dance as silhouettes 
on the walls and through the windows.
A tinted-window black BMW slowly inches up to me 
and I walk in the opposite direction as hurriedly and 
nonchalantly as I possibly can. The car waits there for a 
bit. I keep going away. Back down the hill. Away from 
my car. They slowly inch down the street, stop at the 
poignantly glowing red light, and then ooze around 
the corner. I hold for a minute. And then I walk back the 
way I had just left, up past the church again, and then 
down to the car. My finger slips and I hit the alarm key. 
I fumble to shut it off. 
It dies off after a couple more protests. Reaching into 
the dark cavern of the hatchback trunk, I set down my 
trusty companion for this little trek. The horn beeps 
as the car assures me that it’s locked. I begin the walk 
back down to Thrival. 30 minutes later and without a 
camera this time. I cycle back through the sounds and 
scenes as I did on my way out. Everything still rings but 
is a little more distant from me this time around.
Knowing I will be just in time to witness Lauren’s “Thank 
you for being amazing fans” and “We’ve loved playing 
for you”, I still trudged back down my familiar hill. A 
journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.

DOG SEES GODGod Sees Dog
Exhibit at the Frame is abstract and laden with symbology
The Frame Gallery is an adaptable space that 
exhibiting artists can configure in any way to 
best suit their work. Each exhibition transforms 
the space in an endless number of different ways, 
but there are two constant components — two 
wooden benches that are always available for 
the comfort of the viewer. For the opening night 
of junior art majors Jack Taylor and Matthew 
Constant’s ‘GOD SEES DOG’ last Friday at 5 p.m., 
however, the benches were a bit harder to spot.
This was the work of Constant. Constant is very 
particular about the shaping of the gallery space, 
and in this exhibition he used a number of recy-
cled materials — metal tiles, wall molding, the 
wooden benches, and even a yardstick — to cul-
tivate a minimalist elegance that remained laid-
back and relaxed. This broke away from the tra-
ditional popular expectations of a gallery space. 
Rather than a stuffy, cavernous space where no 
one is allowed to talk, ‘GOD SEES DOG’ was a 
welcoming space that gallery-goers could experi-
ence in whatever way best suited them.
Constant’s art featured a number of repetitions 
and patterns that connected all of the works to 
each other. This motif not only created a feeling 
of continuity between numerous pieces scattered 
across the room, but could also be seen within 
contained works. In particular, one piece featured 
a repetition of one print placed slightly differ-
ently each time. This spacing created a dizzying, 
almost holographic effect that changed depend-
ing on the location of the viewer.
The first and most noticeable presence in the 
room was the multitude sunflower seeds strewn 
around the space. Either shaped into footprints, 
carefully placed on a rug, or piled high in bowls 
and frames, the seeds were impossible to miss 
and created a unique awareness of transience. 
Constant stated that the sunflower seeds were a 
reference to his time playing Little League in his 
hometown, and that the inclusion of them was a 
nod to the distinction between things of the past 
and things of the present.
Taylor creates work using a system of specific 
symbols to communicate multiple layers of mean-
ing. In his own admission, Taylor’s work draws a 
lot from cartoons and their structural elements. 
Much like your typical Saturday morning car-
toon favors the archetypes of “The Hero,” “The 
Villain,” or “The Sidekick” to communicate a story 
effectively and efficiently, Taylor uses abstracted 
human forms to apply his works to the greater 
whole of humanity. The viewer can see themself 
in his art more easily, as the abstracted forms 
have no distinguishing and possibly excluding 
characteristics. However, Taylor’s paintings are 

---------------------------------------------------

in no way simplistic or lacking in complexity of 
meaning. 
While each symbol in his system is understand-
able in the context of itself, it is the combina-
tion of the symbols that creates layered and 
obscured meaning. One painting in particular 
shows the playful, cartoony image of a person 
being stabbed. 
The figure is bleeding, but not in the gory, dis-
comforting way of a real flesh-and-blood person. 
This contrast of situation and depiction shows a 
duality echoed in the rest of Taylor’s work. A few 
of Taylor’s works abstracted even further, decon-
structing more complex symbols in simpler lines 
and shapes. The interplay of colors and simpler 
shapes were the draw of these works, suggest-
ing meaning, but ultimately leaving the weight 
of interpretation on the viewer. In general, these 
works focused more on movement over meaning 
and how abstract visuals can evoke feeling within 
the viewer.
While compelling in each of their individual con-
texts, the juxtaposition of Taylor and Constant’s 
work allowed a new feeling to emerge. This 
feeling captured a nostalgia for past moments 
and the confusion that comes with the future, 
but ultimately grew beyond that to the idea of 
movement through the experiences of the world. 
Both artists drew from personal occurrences and 
universal experiences as perceived through the 
lens of the individual. 
This careful balance between particularity 
of experience and universality of experience 
allowed the gallery-goers to relate to each piece 
in a way guided by the artist but particular to 
the individual. Constant’s focus was on the way 
that the traditional media’s artistic structures can 
be pushed and how audience experience can be 
altered by physical reality. Taylor’s focus was on 
the interaction of humanity with the world and 
how people can create messages to alter that 
world and other people in it.
The exhibition was ultimately an interesting look 
into the connection between two artists with dif-
ferent styles and backgrounds. The cooperation 
of the two artists’ works created a unique aes-
thetic that neither collection would have created 
in an isolated exhibition. 
The construction of the gallery space in an 
unusual way — with the benches incorporated 
and the pieces staged as low as the floor to right 
below the ceiling — guided the viewers through 
a layer exhibition in a unique and less than obvi-
ous way.

How do you present yourself and your artwork in five 
minutes? Sixteen masters students from the Carnegie 
Mellon School of Art had to answer this question 
PechaKucha style round robin this past Friday night. 
A large audience comprised primarily of professors 
and students from the School of Art sat below in 
anticipation. One by one, students went up on stage 
to give a presentation. Some students followed a 
structure reminiscent of a college application portfolio 
review or a lecture, beginning their five minutes by 
eloquently describing the moments and questions that 
sparked their research or the major themes as images 
of their work appeared on screen. Others approached 
their presentations with refreshing informality.
Masters of Fine Arts Class of 2017 student, Moses 
Williams walks onto the stage and grabs a small kitchen 
chair tucked to the side of the stage and sits down. 
He begins to describe a memory probably shared by 
most people in the audience — playing kickball with 
his sister and the neighborhood kids. Williams then 
hunches over, rolls up his black pants just past the knee 
and pushes his sleeves up to the elbow. Then his story 
no longer feels commonplace. His mother frantically 
called the children in from the street and informed 
them she was going to the hospital with their youngest 
sister whose finger was slammed so hard by the 
bathroom door it was about to fall off. Williams then 
grabs a tub; maybe shaving cream or gesso? It’s lard. 
Slipping through his fingers, Williams applies a thick 
layer of lard onto his legs as he begins the next part 
of his story. In a moment so still, yet transcendent, he 
describes standing in front of the mirror in his parents’ 
room sobbing while redefining the part in his hair 
over and over and over again. He ends by asking the 
audience to join him in a call-and-repeat song, and the 
first line, “For seven years I’ve loved” echoes throughout 
the room transforming into a shared dialogue. The 
song soon ends. Williams quietly gets up, exits the 
stage, and suggests that someone else controls the 
powerpoint. The audience chuckles. 
MFA ‘19 student, Nick Crockett is up next. He quickly 
goes through slides of his work explaining to the 
audience that he has a new game for them that will be 
more interesting than the powerpoint. He talks about 
games as a way to reframe the world, a medium he 
considers closer to dance and theater than film. Then 
he lands on the slide the whole room is waiting for, a 
yellow flashing gif that reads new game. Two people 
come up on stage, introduce themselves, and Crockett 
reads them the objective: the first player to kiss their 
opponent on the forehead is the winner. The audience 
roars as the two players begin an awkward tango, 
grabbing at one another’s knees and backs trying to 
get them to sink down into an optimal forehead-kissing 
position.
MFA ‘17 student, Lee Webster runs up on stage 
cheering and soon telling the audience about the 
process of getting into Carnegie Mellon’s competitive 
MFA program and her life as an orphan. She alternates 
between three slides: the first is solid black, applause in 
bold, blue text is written at the bottom of the second 
slide, laughter in bold, and orange font replaces 
applause in the third slide. Ironically, the audience 
does not know exactly how to respond, even though 
Webster projects the laughter slide after stating both 
her parents are dead. After introducing herself she 
acknowledges that the audience is probably ready to 
see her work. Webster fills the remainder of her time 
with various laughs and exits the stage. Many do not 
know what to think, still the entire room is mystified 
and captivated by Webster in the span of five minutes. 
I overhear two students whispering at the end of the 
lecture, “I heard that Lee is actually really quiet.” 
I went into this presentation thinking I would make 
an infographic with brief summaries about each MFA 
student. After witnessing lectures that felt more like 
a series of stories and calculated first impressions, it 
became clear summaries would be incomplete at best. 
Look out for their upcoming shows and expect to be 
challenged, humored, and impressed by the artists in 
the MFA program.
The MFA candidates are Shobun Baile, Kevin Brophy, 
Brittany DeNigris, Hannah Epstein, Lee Webster, Alex 
Lukas, Adam Milner,Katie Rose Pipkin, Joy Poulard, Gray 
Swartzel, Moses Williams, Paper Buck, Nick Crockett, 
Shohei Katayama, Erin Mallea, and Jisoo Yeo.
