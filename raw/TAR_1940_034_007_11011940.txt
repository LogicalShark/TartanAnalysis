Norman Thomas Speaks 
In Lecture Hall Tonight
Meeting Sponsored 
By Socialist Party 
Open to Public
By Barbara Kramer
Mr. Norman Thomas, Socialist 
candidate for President, will speak 
tonight at 8:15 p. m. in Carnegie 
¿Lecture Hall. This meeting, which 
is free to the public, is sponsored 
by the Socialist Party.
Known well to many Carnegie 
Tech students by virtue of his ap­
pearance as a speaker on campus 
for the past three, years, Mr. 
Thomas has twice challenged 
Wendell Willkie, Republican can­
didate, for President, to debate, the 
first time at the beginning of the 
campaign, and the second last 
week. Son of a Protestant minis­
ter, he himself was a minister un­
til the First World War, when 
he gave up his ministership to fight 
against war and militarism.
This fight, which has charac­
terized his political and personal 
life for the last twenty-odd years, 
was the deciding factor in his ac­
ceptance of nomination this year. 
Like President Roosevelt, Mr. 
Thomas, who has been the Social­
ist candidate for the last three 
campaigns, had no intention of 
accepting renomination, but felt 
thiit, because^ of'tlie'-'p'eriious' con­
ditions on the internal, as well as 
the foreign, front, he should again 
take up the cudgels vagainst con­
scription and increased militar­
ism.
In addition to his political 
career as leader of the Socialist 
Party in United States, Mr. Thom­
as has also written several books 
among which are: “The Way Out” 
and “Socialism on the Defensive,” 
the latter a publication of recent 
months. Always an interesting 
speaker, his appearance in Pitts­
burgh is most timely today as we 
enter the last lap of a feverish 
Presidential campaign, and should 
prove of interest to the entire 
public.

Tech-in-Color Features Music 
By Jerry Hahn9 Pitt Senior
All right, we know that Hal­
lowe’en is over, and the season 
for ghosts and “haunts” is past, 
but the season is just starting for 
Jerry Hahn and His Hahnting 
Music. Red headed Jerry, who is 
a senior at pitt (notice the lower 
case) has led this aggregation of 
nine smooth men for four years 
now.
The boys call him “Simon La- 
Hahn,” supposedly because he’s 
such a hard taskmaster, but we 
know better. Jerry, whom we’ve 
seen three times, is never without 
that engaging grin, which is one 
big season for the band’s contin­
ued success. The “Hahnts” have 
played for style shows, night clubs, 
hotels, etc., and were at a well 
known night spot all this sum­
mer. Maybe some of you heard 
their smooth rhythms there.
At any rate, you’ll hear them in 
the gym this afternoon at 4:30. 
Tech-in-color is not only a fashion 
show, you know, but it a mus­
ical show too. That end of the 
proceedings will be taken care 
of by Mr. Hahn and his boys, who 
will also be there afterwards for
Pitt Boy . . .

Did you know that the Coca-

HE Speaks
A Male’s Feelings 
On Tech-in-color
By Paul Guinther
“Clothes make the man.” If this 
statement is true I will certainly 
be a man after Tech-in-color is 
over. Even though the clothes are 
borrowed, they’re swell Hart- 
Schaffner and Marx, no less—and 
even though an engineer feels out 
of place in the Fine Arts Building 
the happy attitude that usually 
goes with a show rehearsal took 
away that feeling.
Frank and Seder’s suits and 
top-coats sure are swell—wish I 
had enough money to buy some, 
even though the discount will 
help a little. I tried to walk out 
of the store with most of the Men’s 
Dept, under my arm. However, 
when Marv Einhorn slunk through 
the room—in “tails”—in typical 
Groucho Marx fashion, I gave up 
that luea ana naa a good laugh in­
stead.
Marv seemed to provide the fun 
for the day for when he wanted 
to leave he discovered that “the 
boys” had loaded down his own 
coat with price tags, etc. Les 
Stanford was also a whack in a 
pork pie hat about five sizes too 
small. I wonder if Frank and Se­
der’s appreciated our attempts ai 
humor as much as we did?
At this point I’m also wonder-; 
ing how it will feel to promen-} 
ade before students and faculty in. 
keen clothes with a. 'beautiful 
femme on my arm. And how I’ll 
do on that Phy. Chem. quiz after 
a week of rehearsing and no 
studying:.
Tech to Hear 
War Lecture
The first assembly under the 
new plan of student selection will 
be held Tuesday, 11:30, in the Fine 
Arts Theater, with Charles Hop­
kins Brown as the lecturer on “25 
Years of War and Peace.”
Newsreels of the First World 
War will aid Mr. Brown in helping 
us to visualize the conditions dur­
ing and after the period of hostil­
ity. Comparison of present day 
conditions with those existing dur­
ing World War I will make his 
lecture a timely one.
Compulsory attendance of every 
student was the outstanding fea­
ture of Tech’s first assemblies. Af­
ter a few years, the students wrote 
a petition saying that they did not 
want to be compelled to attend 
assembly, and if the compulsory 
feature were taken out, they 
would attend on their own accord. 
This method was tried out for 
three years, but attendance de­
creased anyhow. Selection of 
speakers fell on the shoulders of 
the faculty because students gave 
little cooperation in helping to 
solve the problem. In spite of a 
limited budget the faculty spon­
sored the best programs for the 
amount of money allotted.
The new plan of selection will 
give students an opportunity of 
choosing whom they would like to 
hear. A committee consisting of 
Arleigh Heifer ’41, Dr. Gregg, Dr. 
Schultz, responsible to Dr. War­
den, will choose speakers who are 
entertaining and educational.
Because the budget for assem­
blies has been decreased again, the 
committee has decided' to select 
only those paid speakers for whom 
the students show an interest in 
hearing. Of course, local lecturers 
will be selected on the same plan 
also, so that assemblies will have 
a better attendance.
Frosh Tradition Exains
Not all the freshman traditions 
exams have been checked as yet, 
but those freshmen who desire to 
find out may go to their mentor 
and if they did, they will get a pin 
signifying that they did pass their 
exams. . ^
Commentator . . .Fashion Show to Rival 
Hollywood’s Brilliance
By Miriam Rost
Today-—4:30—in tlie Gym—the spotlight turns on TECH- 
In-COLOR, Tecli s first fashion show in seven years. Sponsored 
by TARTAN and FRANK'and SEDER’S this production will be 
in the true Hollywood style. A script, scenery, lighting effect's 
and an especially selected wardrobe for each of the twenty-five 
or so members of the cast, all seem to come straight from the 
Kleig-light Kountry.
The drawing for the winners of the Military Ball tickets will 
take place after the curtain falls on Tecli-in-color. This will be 
done by means *of stubs dropped in a box at the door. Bob 
Buchanan, president of SCABBARD and BLADE, will draw 
the winning tickets and announce the winner’s names.
Don’t forget the Elmo beauty kits and Coca-Colas, too.
Following along in Hollywood tradition, we’re now going to

Noted Chemist 
peaks Thursday
Dr. Waldo L. Semon, research 
chemist for the B. F. Goodrich 
Company, will speak on “Syn­
thetic Rubber,” before Carnegie 
students on Thursday at 4:30 in 
room 218 of Engineering Hall.
Dr. Semon is the inventor of 
Ameripol, new synthetic rubber 
' and creator of KeroSenl, a Good­
rich synthetic rubber-!,ike sub­
stance whose basic materials are 
coal, limestone and salt.
The Pittsburgh section of the 
American Institute of Chemical 
Engineering and the student chap­

Waddell Opens 
Fund Drive
Former football coach Robert 
Waddell will speak in behalf of 
the Community Fund during part 
of the student assembly next 
Tuesday at 11:30 in the Little The­
atre.
This year the Community Fund 
Campaign will start on the campus 
November 11 under the direction 
ol’ Mr. Kent Shaffer, Instructor oC 
Palternmaking. With the permis­
sion of the executive board, stu­
dent representatives will visit 
classes as they did last year and 
ask for pledges from the students 
to help Carnegie roach its goal. 
Last year thto goal of five thousand 
dollars was reached with the com­
bined support of the facility and 
students.
Some of the funds collected 
eventually will be returned to the 
“Y” Cabinet as a part of tho 
money distributed to such organi­
zations devoted to building char­
acter and promoting public wel­
fare.
Mr. Waddell joined the football 
coaching staff in 1920 and remain­
ed with it until 1932. At the pres­
ent time he is on the Board of the 
Pittsburgh Field Club and is the 
General Agent for the Mutual 
Life Insurance Company.
Vincent Lopez Swings 
For Scabbard & Blade
Scabbard and Blade, national R.
O. T. C. honorary, has announced 
that the annual Military Ball will 
be held next Friday night in This­
tle Hall.
Jim Meanor and “Jay!’ Fowler, 
co-chairmen of the Military Ball 
Committee, have prepared quite 
a diversified program. Music will 
be provided by Vincent Lopez and 
his “suave swing” band. During 
intermission at the ball the posi­
tions of the honorary girl cadets 
chosen by the society will be an­
nounced. Decorations will be in 
the form of American flags, and 
favors will be distributed.
Vincent Lopez and his interna­
tionally known band are giving 
swing enthusiasts plenty to cheer 
about these days. For as all con- 
nisseurs of swing know, he no 
longer purveys tunes of the sweet 
variety but his own brand of 
swing called Suave Swing. Vince 
became an immediate swing con­
vert when the craze swallowed up 
the youth of America several sum­
mers ago. After much experi­
mentation and research, however, 
he found that swing’s fine quali­
ties could be realized without an 
exhausting and ear-splitting din. 
Thus he has devedoped a slower, 
gentler, more relaxed way of 
phrasing melody—“Suave Swing.”
Lopez directed his first band at 
the tender age of 18 just after the 
close of the last war in vaudeville 
show. With the advent of radio, 
his band was the first to be fea­
tured regularly on the air. Later 
he gave radio its first catch- 
phrase, and soon became the first 
band on sustaining.
Some of the more famous
Band Leader .
. . . Plays at Thistle Hall 
musicians who got their start 
with Lopez are: Rudy Valle, Artie 
Shaw, T. and J. Dorsey, Red 
Nichols, and Xavier Cugat. Of 
course, Vince is no slouch himself, 
especially on the piano, over which 
his fingers can move at the rate 
of 2,200 notes a minute. Fea­
tured in the band will be Bob 
Spangler, a recently acquired hot 
drummer and Anne Barrett his 
beautiful feminine vocalist, who 
does the jitterbug songs.
Cooperating with Jim and Jay 
in making the dance a success will 
be Eugene Daties, in charge of 
the orchestra committee; Donald 
Stingel and Bracken Cox, in 
charge of advertising and broad­
casting; and Robert Flaherty in 
charge of favors.

“The office of Financial Aid for 
Students is for the use of students 
and their problems,” stated tho 
new counselor. “It will be our aim 
to help the students in whatever 
way possible to solve these prob­
lems.”

2THE CARNEGIE TAUTANFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1940
Four Years of Tech 
For What?
His number was among the first to be picked for the draft.
CJlose to realizing bin ambition of becoming a scientist, be 
lias only been out of Carnegie Tech since June. June ended 
four years of struggle. He wanted an education his iamily did 
not have thc-mpney to provide—so he provided it for himself. It 
meant four solid years of work. It meant getting up early to 
serve breakfast at the fraternity house, working afternoons, 
starting at (i A. M. on Saturday mornings to help a baker deliver 
his bread. It meant skimping and saving. It meant, no money for 
good times. It meant no time for good times. The necessity of 
earning money out so deeply into his twenty-four hours that it 
required an almost steady diet of caffeine pills to stretch the days.
But he had decided that he was to be a scientist. Work 
was the only way to achieve that goal. So work he did. Sum­
mers were spent as a day laborer to help meet tuition in Septem­
ber. Work. Work. Work. lie showed signs of breaking even 
before his senior year—but his will to succeed was strong enough 
to keep him going. His friends marveled that lie could stand the 
strain. But he was strong and he was determined.
To those who watched his struggle, he became a symbol.
Graduation came at last. Then the hunt for a job. Disap­
pointment after disappointment. Finally, an opening. Not good. 
A small salary. But it will provide experience and it will make 
it possible to send at least some money home to help the family. 
Best of all it involves research. It means that a man has a chance 
to use the tools that he has spent four years of heartbreak and 
hard work to fashion. It means that the long sleepless nights, 
the heat and sweat of a work-gang, the cramming for exams have 
not been in vain.
He feels that he is getting his reward for honest effort. The 
goal which he set himself four long years ago is before him. He 
has a job in his own field.
All this was yesterday.
Today his number was among the first to be picked for the 
draft.
Style Show Today
There is no point in keeping- secret that today’s style show 
is largely the work of TARTAN Business Manager Herb Reich. 
The arrangements from the beginning have been in his hands, 
and the credit for the success of Tech-in-color belongs to him.
If you have seen Herb chasing around campus like a be­
headed chicken, and wondered, here’s the answer. He was only 
attending to the million and one details involved in putting on 
the campus’ biggest spectacle.
Today is the big day. At 4:30 Tech-in-color takes its bow be­
fore the students.
Ciive Sl iiileiBts si Vote
Pennsylvania is one of the few states without a provision for 
voting by absentee ballot.. That does not afl'ect the Tech stu­
dent as seriously as it does the students of some other schools. 
Penn State students, a large number of whom are disenfranchis­
ed by the failure of the state legislature to make provision for 
them, have started a. movement to bring pressure to bear on the 
members of I lie legislature to take care of the problem.
If tlio speeches wo hear as freshmen, as students and as 
graduates, about the importance of our educated citizens have any 
truth at all, they certainly argue for allowing the college student 
to vote even though lie may not be at home at election time.
Students from most states exercise their franchise under the 
absentee ballot privilege. In. this matter, as in many others, 
Pennsylvania lags liar behind.
It is too late to do any things about this election. But there 
will be others. A letter to your state representative might be in 
order.
I*aUMetttlull’s Savoyards
A cultural movement in Pittsburgh which is getting far less 
attention than it deserves, is the presentation of Gilbert and Sul­
livan operettas by the Savoyards. With the European War pre­
venting the regular tour of the P’Oyle Carte troupe, the Savoy­
ards are making excellent substitutes.
The operettas are now more than fifty years old, but they 
still provide a good laugh. Making fun of stuffed shirts.will 
probably always be popular.

War Adventures
Because she “didn’t want to 
starve or work in a department 
store,” Janie Hathaway changed to 
a social worker after always being 
a dramat for one and a half 
years. 33'yt although art is in her 
heart, she likes Margaret Morrison 
College.
As treasurer of Mortar Board 
and President of the Women’s 
Guild, Jane is a very busy young 
lady. Her chief ambition is to 
put the Guild on the map. You 
have more than likely seen the 
little, brown eyed, brown hair­
ed, girl working in the hut— that’s 
her place of business.
Janie’s pet love is chicken the 
way “they” fry it in Illinois but 
can’t swallow spinach, brussel 
sprouts, or sardines—her pet hate 
is 8:30’$, and can’t understand why 
Industries was built—so many of 
her classes are at the other end 
—she is always hurrying some­
where late.
Don’t be surprised if you see 
Janie become a farmer, as she 
likes the farm better than the city. 
Maybe that’s because she likes 
chicken. Jane loves to dance, 
and smooth dancing is her spe­
cialty. She has little use for the 
jitterbug, shagger, or trucker; but 
smooth dancing, ah.
Characteristic of Janie is her 
little chuckle, which for some un­
known reason she is trying to re-

The Beetles own Janie—her sor­
ority is her hobby. That’s what we 
call true enthusiasm. Her enthus­
iasm for singing is “not appre­
ciated by people, though,” she 
sighed, but hopes to be able to 
carry a tune some day.
If someone can teach Janie to 
be real sweet, please come to her 
aid. She just loves people who 
are . . . confidentially I don’t 
think she needs any lessons.
Jane plans to be a school teach­

Subversive Fashion Elements 
Overwhelm Carnegie Campus
By Walter Haller
Caesar had his Brutus, Disney 
had his Mickey Mouse, Mary had 
her little lamb, but just what has 
Carnegie had to call its very own? 
The Kiltie Band? Yes. The Ski- 
bo and Al’s “In-sti-tute,” of 
course. But insidiously creeping 
onto our campus has come another 
rare phenomenon.
Starting somewhere in the 
depths of the Printing Department 
and persistently working its way 
upward, this new “thing” has 
gradually, reared its ugly head to 
peer into the smoggy soot of up­
per Oakland, and now begins to 
threaten the very bulwarks of 
Carnegie’s sartorial fortress. So 
universal is its malicious infiltra­
tion that even several Betas have 
been seen gracing Induestries 
Hall wearing their litle blue—yes, 
you’ve guessed the ,awful truth— 
dungarees. .
The advantages of wearing dun­
garees are legion. You don’t have 
to hang them up—they stand in 
the corner of themselves. They 
are pre-shrunk, so its perfectly 
safe to take a shower in them. If 
you happen tor be allergic to soap, 
however, you don’t have to take a 
shower at all—blame it on the

dungarees.
From the economic point of 
view, dungarees are unrivalled as 
the perfect apparel for the stu­
dent with a deflated purse. In 
the interest of consistency, shav­
ing becomes unnecessary, thus 
cutting down on the cost of razors 
and shaving cream. Best of all, 
dungarees save money on dates, 
for after you have worn a pair for 
a month no one will go out with 
you.
Besides being admirably suited 
to Dramats on crew, Engineers in 
labs, and Printers in shops, dun­
garees give sturdy services as ink 
wipers, temporary blackboards, 
fingernail files, and pencil sharp­
eners.
Correct accessories, according to 
the most reliable authorities, in­
clude a blue work shirt or a loud 
plaid, tattle-tale grey athletic 
socks, and saddles or sneakers. 
Dungarees should preferably be 
worn six inches off the ground
¦ with a two-inch rolled cuff. Fur­
thermore, boys and girls, you- sim­
ply aren’t properly dressed if you 
have even the semblance of a press 
in your trouser-legs.
In a noble effort to conserve ex­
isting dungarees supplies and start 
the prosperity ball a-rolling, Mike 
Bosak, ’42, and Bob Barvoets, ’41, 
have organized the firm of Bar- 
sak’s Enterprises, Unlimited. It 
all started when Barvoets found 
his clothing supply running low, 
and put a pair of dungarees into 
immediate use. The record is not 
q'uite so clear as to how Bosak 
took up the fad, but indications are 
promising.
Since its inception, the dungaree 
campaign has been gathering mo­
mentum, all unheedful of wars or 
rumors of wars. Things have 
reached the point where most of 
the best-dressed men on the cam­
pus (meaning the Printers, of 
course) can be seen clad in those 
little blue things. . Do you have 
yours? Remember, it is pro­
nounced “dungarees,” as in the 
word “dungarees.”
Kilties Hold Tryouts
On Saturday afternoon, Novem­
ber 2, 1940, the Kiltie Band will 
hold its second tryouts at 12:30 
P. M. in Arts 157.
Anyone interested in trying out 
is requested to come, whether he 
were present at the first tryout or 
not.
One of approximately two hun- 
dred-and-eighty degrees students 
at Manchester Tech, Andrew Va- 
dasz had all the intentions of con­
tinuing his education at that in­
stitution, until it became the cen­
ter of a German air raid and was 
laid in ruins. Thereupon, he enr 
listed in the Royal Air force Vol­
untary Reserve, but was after­
wards dismissed due to his for­
eign birth. Still undaunted, he 
applied for admission to Carnegie 
Tech, and was accepted by the 
Electrical Engineering Department 
last August as an irregular sopho­
more.
Friday, October 11, Vadasz ar- 
, rived here at Tech eleven days 
after leaving London, England. He 
traveled on the Samaria, one of 
a group of ships making the cross­
ing. While on board he had an 
interesting experience. In "the 
midst of his bath one day the 
Samaria was rocked by two depth 
charges from an attacking sub­
marine. Rushing out on deck, he 
was in time to witness the two 
destroyers accompanying the con­
voy chase the marauder away.
Like the British people this' 
English lad believes that Britain 
will win the war, although his 
belief is based on hope rather than 
anything else. He does not think 
that the United States will enter' 
the war or play any part in the po­
litical reconstruction of Europe 
after it ends; however, he predicts 
greater material aid to Britain.
According to Andy, the British 
are encountering many inconven­
iences due to the war, among
Phi Mu’s Sponsor 
Song Contest
In the past week or so a peti­
tion has been floating around cam­
pus for the purpose of asking Fred 
Waring to write a new song for 
Carnegie. By way of the Campus 
telegraph, the Phi Mu Alphas got 
wind of it and were slightly per­
turbed. It seems that they, be­
ing the Men’s Musical Honorary 
fraternity are wholly “agin” it. To 
quote Jack Purcell, ’41, Tech songs 
have always been written by Tech 
people, so why break the tradi­
tion? The trouble with this school 
is that they don’t recognize their 
own talent.”
Just to prove how serious they 
are the Phi Mu’s are sponsoring a 
gigantic song contest to give the 
composers on campus a chance to 
redeem themselves. The judges as 
yet have not been chosen nor the 
prize decided upon, but the par­
ticulars of the contest will be an­
nounced within a week or two. In 
the meantime, start collecting 
ideas.

which are increased taxation, food

penditures due to the war in 
Britain are nine million pounds 
(close to 40 million dollars per 
day). Some ways in which the 
people are trying to economize arej. 
saving all waste paper, old rugs, 
scrap metal, bones, and using their 
mail envelopes several times. The 
main slogan on signs posted in 
nearly all London business es­
tablishments is “Business as Us­
ual.”
“Politically, there is no discon­
tent in Britain” says Vadasz. 
“Neville Chamberlain and Lord 
Halifax are, to be sure, not pop­
ular with the people; but Winston 
Churchill and Sh Anthony Eden 
are. The British believe King 
Leopold of Belgium to be a traitor; 
they have a high regard for the 
Belgian Army, admire the Poles 
and Norwegians, and think of the 
Dutch as gallant allies. About the 
French there is little or no talk; 
the people are too bitter to discuss 
them.”
Andy, himself, has no political 
policies, though he admits being 
a liberal. He was surprised to see 
that most of the students here be­
lieve in the capitalistic system, for 
many British students believe in 
socialism.
“I like Carnegie Tech and the 
campus” stated Andy, “and I hope 
to make the most of the oppor­
tunity afforded me.”
Brain Teaser
Just before the school year end­
ed at a Mid-Western college, four 
students, farm boys named Will, 
George, Henry, and Dick, happen­
ed to be together in Henry’s room. 
Naturally the talk was about go­
ing home. Henry was going to fly 
65 miles to his home. The rest 
were going west and south, each 
in his own car, oyer roads follow­
ing section lines; a section, of 
course, is a square piece of land 
one mile on a side. George had to 
drive six miles further than Will, 
but six miles less than Dick. The 
Smiths live 12 miles by road from 
the Blacks and 10 miles from the 
Fords, who live 34 miles from the 
Jonses. Henry, who thinks along 
flying lines, said they all lived 
exactly the same distance from the 
college, since the homes and the 
college are at corners of sections. 
To what family does each of the 
boys belong?

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1940THE CARNEGIE TARTANS
Tommy Loncliar (left) and Mike Gretchen (right) are two of the 
larger claws in the “Bearcats” offensive. Beside tlieir outstanding 
offensive punch these two stalwarts are strong props in the Cincy 
gridders defense.
Touch Footballers 
Enter Final Week
Timmons, a junior fullback. The 
quarterbacks are Hal Sterneberg, 
and Lloyd Brown, Sterneberg in 
particular is playing outstanding 
ball at this blocking post.
Their very strong line is flanked 
by Wainscott and Croucher, both 
outstanding players. Tom Ma­
lone, sophomore left tackle is an 
outstanding tackle, as is Ray Vir­
gin, the guard who is always in 
there playing for keeps. Bedway 
and Sauer are the probable start­
ing guards, and Oppenheimer is 
the right tackle.
The Tartan squad is back to 
full strength, with the exception 
of Joe Betz, who is still on his 
back in the Presbyterian Hos­
pital. John McLaughlin, sub half­
back who has been out with a bad 
shoulder, has returned to action, 
also Joe Pash, speedy right half­
back, who suffered a bad chest in­
jury in the Notre Dame game. Big 
George Muha is also ready for ac­
tion after at least partially recov­
ering from a shoulder injury also 
sustained in the game with the 
Irish two weeks ago. The team 
has looked good in practice all 
week, and the players feel that 
they will win the game if they 
continue to play as in the Case 
game and if none of the regulars 
are hurt again.
Frosh Harriers 
Take First, Lose 
Second Contest
The Tech Freshmen Harriers 
have gotten under way with two 
meets already run. The first meet 
was held with Westinghouse High 
on the WPIAL Course in Schen- 
ley Park, on October 15t5h. Tech 
was the successful team with 
Pritchard, Carnegie Tech, making 
the run in seven minutes and 
forty-flve seconds. Lipscond, West­
inghouse High, came in second, 
with Macosko, another Techite en­
tering in third place. Hirschfield, 
Rotzler, and Broad, all of the home 
team placed fifth, sixth and sev­
enth in order. The score of the 
meet was Carnegie Tech 22, West­
inghouse High 33.
The second meet was held with 
Schenley High on the same course 
on October 24th. In this event the 
Harriers were outrun, and were 
defeated by a score of 26-29. In 
this meet Pritchard of Carnegie 
Tech again placed first with the 
time of thirteen minutes and 
thirty seconds. However, Banks 
and Duncan of the Schenley High 
squad placed second and third 
respectively, and Macosko and 
I-Iershfield of the Tech aggrega­
tion took fourth and fifth places in 
order.
Dark Future 
For Riflemen
With the graduation of almost 
the complete varsity last year the 
outlook for the rifle team this 
year is none too bright. The 
varsity this year will have to 
shoot high, wide, and handsome 
to come up to the standards set 
by the riflemen last year since the 
boys placed third at the Middle 
Atlantic Regionals, fifth in the Na­
tional meet, and maintained the 
highest standard in Tech’s his­
tory. Among those who are re­
turning this year are: Rathbun, 
Fletcher, Bateman, Evans, Diet- 
rich, Callender, Ritchey, Williams, 
Reichenecker, Obringer, Curry and 
Snyder.
Belts Draw Bye 
In Scheduled 
Final Contests
With the Touch Football season 
nearing its completion two games 
remain to be played. The D.U.’s 
,and Junior Mfctnllurgii^ were 
scheduled to piny the semi-finals 
Wednesday, October 30, the win­
ner of this game will meet the 
Delts Friday, November 1. Thoso 
teams drew lots to determine 
which two teams would piny in 
the semifinals and the Delts drew 
a bye which places them in the 
final.
Some hot battling on Monday 
saw the Junior Metallurgists 
emerging from their games with 
the A.T.O.’s with a neat 29-20 
win under their collective belts. 
Both lines charged hard and tag­
ged many n 'ball handler in his 
own bnckfield. Piny was close, 
but the difference in the score can 
be attributed to the long passing 
combination of the Metallurgists. 
This passing team clocked for 
three touchdowns and mnny sub­
stantial gains, with Dierker on the 
tossing end and Shymowsky re­
ceiving. The A.T.O.’s were par­
ticularly good on short passes but 
could not make up the scores to 
put them in the win column.
Delts Whip Kappa Sigs
The Delt-Kappa Sig game was 
nip and tuck in the first half, but 
the latter weakened in the second. 
After receiving the opening kick- 
off the Kappa Sigs rolled up one 
first down then turned the ball 
over to the Delts. Both teams were 
stymied for a time, but the Kappa 
Sigs threatened thrice without 
scoring. The first score came in 
the second quarter with Patton 
snatching a flat pass intended for 
McCain. In the second half the 
Delts mustered their scoring 
punch to score again and put the 
total at 13-2. Backs of both teams 
blocked very well to handle the 
incoming horde. Play was par­
ticularly rugged witnessed by the 
fact that players of both teams 
are sporting black eyes and sore 
ribs. Friday’s game promises to 
be a fine, hard fought fray.
Basketball Next
Shortly after the close of foot­
ball basketball will come into its 
own. All organizations wishing 
to enter a team must register them 
by November 19.
There are twenty dates open for
the playing of basketball games 
in the afternoon. In the past many 
organizations did not enter a team 
because the players had to return 
to the campus in the evening. To 
allpw these teams to enter, these 
twenty dates were made available. 
If there are nny questions on the

set up of the league, Rittenhouse 
should be contacted.
More Points Toward Trophy 
Several sports have been added 
to those that go toward the Intra­
mural Point Trophy. Badminton, 
handball, squash, volleyball, box­
ing and wrestling are to be placed 
on a competitive basis, thus af­
fording a system by which the 
winners will be awarded points. 
Arrangements can be made for 
practice hours for these sports 
through Mr. Eyman.

Steffen Fund
Alumni Method of Athletic 
Subsidation Expained For All
By Bob Cowie
It is thought by the writer that, 
although it is often the topic of 
.general campus conversation, the 
Steffen Memorial Scholarship 
Eund is not fully understood by 
the students. And so after a very 
enlightening discourse with Miss 
Marguerite Spilman, Executive 
Secretary of the Alumni Federa­
tion, and whom we may thank for 
her interest and advice, the ele­
ments of the plan can be stated.
“In reviewing the financial ar­
rangements of all members of the 
squad (November 1938) the Stef­
fen Memorial Scholarship Com­
mittee and the Faculty Committee 
on Steffen Scholarships moved 
to adopt the principles (a) 
that, primarily, the ends of 
•education are to be served; 
that is, although athletic 
promise is an important factor, 
nothing is to be gained by encour­
aging a student to enter or remain 
in college who cannot creditably 
pass his work; (b) that the pur­
pose of awarding scholarships 
shall be only to supplement the 
resources available to the student 
for meeting his necessary college 
expenses; (c) that the individual 
amounts of the scholarships 
awarded be within the range of 
amounts of other scholarships at 
Carnegie Institute of Technology; 
(d) that the awards be for one 
year at a time and only upon 
formal application; (e) that can­
didates must be proposed at an 
early enough time to assure them 
a reasonable chance in the compe­
tition of selective admission; ‘and 
(f) that the total value from all 
sources, including self-help earn­
ings, received in any one year by 
any member of the squad be not 
greater than the reasonable total 
expenses for that year, in his par­
ticular case, as estimated by the 
Steffen Memorial Scholarship 
Committee on Steffen Scholar­
ships. (The Cost of a Year at Car­
negie, as published in the annual 
catalogue together with the spe­
cific needs of the individual stu­
dent. will provide a basis for es­
tablishing “the reasonable total 
expenses.”)
From this and other instructive 
information received it can be di­
vined that absolutely no student 
is promised any sort of remunera­
tion for athletic ability before he 
enters school. Only after he has 
been duly registered and accepted

can he apply for aid from the Stef­
fen Memorial Scholarship Fund.
The following is an exceipt 
from the Steffen Fund Report in 
the October 1940 edition of the 
Carnegie Alumnus:
“The annual report of the Stef­
fen Memorial Scholarship Fund of 
the Alumni Federation shows that 
the sum of $4,948.87 was raised 
during the past fiscal period. From 
the previous -year there remained 
a balance of approximately $900.
Awards have been made for the 
1940-41 year in the amount of 
$55,750. The ten original Steffen 
Scholarship students are receiving 
annual awards of $450 each. Two 
other original Steffen Scholarship 
recipients who have returned to 
college after officially withdraw­
ing are being helped with smaller 
amounts, and upon the recommen­
dation of Coach Baker, the surplus 
in the fund has been used to help 
four other members of the squad 
who came to Carnegie with no 
thought of receiving scholarship 
aid. These men have been found 
to be good football material, but 
long practice hours limited their 
possibilities of earning enough 
money for their needs.
Those who are receiving Steffen 
Scholarships for the current year 
are Joseph Betz, Charles .Braun, 
Ted Fisher, Henry Holets, Frank 
Jordano, William Kuenzli, An­
thony Laposki, Ted Pruger, 
Charles Rader, Walter Wind, Chris 
Moersch (left school), Robert 
Church, Wayne Forsythe, Michael 
Saska, William Johnson, and Rob­
ert Dominy.
Alumni who are interested in 
carrying on the Steffen Memorial 
Scholarship Fund as a means of 
encouraging representative inter­
collegiate teams at Carnegie Tech 
are preparing now to work 
through their Clan organizations 
to raise the 1941-1942 Fund. No 
Clan is obligated to assist in this 
activity. The following Clans upon 
the vote of their memberships co­
operated officially last year: Bos­
ton, Buffalo, Butler, Cleveland, 
Erie, Gary, Harrisburg, Philadel­
phia Men’s Clan, Pittsburgh Men’s 
Clan, Southern California, and 
Youngstown Men’s Clan. The Stef­
fen Memorial Scholarship. Com­
mittee hopes for a continuation 
of their assistance during the 
present football season, and trusts 
that additional Clans will support 
the scholarship fund this year. 
When the Steffen Memorial Schol­
arship Committee of the Alumni 
Federation assumed the job of 
conducting this piece of work, 
there were nineteen men on the 
football squad who had been 
promised financial assistance by 
the former Walter P. Steffen 
Memorial Scholarship Fund. This 
number has been reduced by var­
ious circumstances to ten whose 
attendance has been continuous 
since entering Carnegie.” Of the 
men now receiving financial aid, 
eleven are graduating this year.

Spark Bearcats 
Against Skibos
Carnegie Tech’s rejuvenated 
football squad will be the guest 
of the Bearcats of the University 
of Cincinnati at Cincinnati to­
morrow. After the fine come­
back against Case last Saturday, 
the followers of the Tartans are 
hoping for an impressive victory 
although the Cincinnati boys play 
a very good grade of football.
The Cincinnati team has won 
three of' their six games thus far 
this season, defeating Hanover, 
the University of Louisville, and 
Centre. They have lost to Navy, 
the University of Boston, and Day­
ton University, by small scores. 
The Bearcats play a wide open 
brand of football and on a whole 
are a fast team getting down on 
punts and the kickoff rapidly. Al­
though there are sophomores on 
the team, there is little of the 
unsureness of first year players.
Cincinnati is coached by Joe 
Meyer, a Notre Dame graduate of 
1919, who uses the Notre Dame 
system with variations. He has de­
veloped a very strong line; all 
touchdowns that have been scored 
against them have been scored by 
the aerial route. Boston Univers­
ity scored two touchdowns on them 
by this method in the last quar­
ter to win 14-0, and Navy scored 
one of their two tallies on a 
fumbled punt.
The Cincinnati running attack is 
carried on by Tommy Lonchar, a 
junior left halfback, who is the 
shiftiest man on the squad, and 
sophomore Don Davis who is the 
forward passer and a fleet end 
sweeper. Also aiding these play­
ers are Malloy Dixon, whose spe­
cialties are long touchdown runs, 
and Griest, a junior right half­
back. The plunging backs are “Iron 
Mike” Gretchen, a sophomore, and
“Buddy” Overend 
Writes Letter 
To Sports Editor
The following is a letter receiv­
ed by the “TARTAN” Sports 
Editor during the past week, its 
contents may help to explain our 
school’s future football policy: 
Dear Bill,
I note with interest your ar­
ticle in “The Carnegie Taratn” is­
sue of October 22, 1940, and es­
pecially with reference to the item, 
“The school officials should take a 
lesson from the past game.”
I feel positive that there will 
be no argument whatsoever on this 
subject for the reason that we 
all think along the same lines as 
you do; in fact, this has been be­
fore the members of the Athletic 
Board on numerous occasions, and 
from President Doherty down, they 
are all of the same opinion,, and 
we have been working diligently 
to accomplish just what you have 
mentioned, that is, to get our 
schedule down to Class B as soon 
as we possibly can.
But on the other hand, you 
must remember that we have cer­
tain committments which have 
been made three or four years in 
advance, and just as soon as these 
contracts have been fulfilled, the 
schedules will be adjusted. Take 
for instance, the contract with 
Notre Dame, which was made by 
telegram on June 10, 1937, and 
includes games for the years 1940 
and 1941. At the time this con­
tract -was closed Notre Dame was 
a very desirable game and they 
were courted by almost all of the 
colleges in the United States and 
we (felt very fortunate in being able 
to book games for the two years 
mentioned. At the same time we 
might be able to keep our schedule 
on a more or less 50-50 basis with 
perhaps three Class A teams and 
five Class B teams, but we can as­
sure you that as soon as our 
present committments come to an 
end, our schedule will be of Class 
B calibre, one which we should be 
able to play with interest.
Sincerely yours,
CLARENCE OVEREND.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN________________________________________________________FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1940
h ti ttersc o ich
By Ruth Brodie
Traveling from Now York last, week, in a strictly plebian con­
veyance, we got to thinking about the strange way .all conception 
of place disappears when you travel. Evepy tiinc the bus stopped 
at one of those “comfort stations,” and we struggled out of a half 
sleep for more coffee and doughnuts, it was like coming to earth 
after an existence completely removed from all the familiar real­
ities. Easton, Pa., Harrisburg, and an unidentified town consist­
ing of two houses and the La Fink Hotel (which is our favorite 
hotel name) were solid points shining into space, like stars in the 
universe. They existed there, and they were the only tangible 
things that did exist, except the interior of the bus, which was 
cold, if this is as significant as it seemed to us in our tliree-cjuar- 
ters-aslcep condition, we are the eighth living person who under­
stands Einstein’s theory.
While in the same t-q-a condition, we wrote the lyrics for a 
torch song to be called “I’m Not In a Holiday Mood.” It was a 
wonderful song, but we can’t remember a word of it.
STAR WAGON
Life is so shaky these days, we had almost given up the idea 
of being famous. Money doesn’t seem to get you anywhere, and 
it must be awfully boring, signing autographs. Not to speak of 
the headache involved in being President. But now we have an­
other goal, and after months of shouting quiz answers at the radio, 
we know that fame is well worth seeking. We want to be famous 
so we can be on Information, Please.
BACCHANALE ON THE AUBOSSON
A sign on a bulletin board we were reading says “Dancing 
can be fun even on a rug,” or some such. Which struck us as 
particularly non sequitur (which means “doesn’t follow” or 
“what is the connection” or “who put the horse in the subway”) 
until we got to meditating on the deep inner meaning of that. It 
has social, archeological, and a lot of other connections. We’re 
not quite sure what they are, but we have a sort of vision of old- 
school reactionaries getting all tired out taking up rugs and 
sprinkling oatmeal on the hardwood—so tired out that they can’t 
put much heart into their dancing. And while they are struggling 
with the living-room Oriental, people who read bulletin boards 
are having fun, even though they are on a rug. There may be 
something of a Buddhist philosophy in this, too, but as we say, 
we’re not sure.
CLOISTERED
President Morehouse, of Drake University, would not allow 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., to speak on his campus because he 
didn’t approve of a college holding discussions of controversial 
issues. Which seems to us to be carrying things to the ideal point, 
a presidential election—one of the most widely discussed in his­
tory—is corning up practically immediately, but President More­
house doesn’t want his boys to be upset. Send your boys to Drake, 
mothers—protect him from the gruesome realities of Presidential 
elections.

Fred Feiler get to the Primrose

It seems that Gene Swisher, to

the mistake of laughing while the 
innocent victim, who grasped the 
shaker partly by the head, pour­

poured the salt over Gene’s plate. 
Meat a little salty, Gene?
Freshmen Faced 
Disaster As Rain 
Continued To Fall
The ROTC boys—especially the 
freshmen who are making a strug­
gle to understand the fundamental 
drills, and aren’t succeeding very 
well—are praying for sunshine, no 
wind, warm weather, and—and 
this is important—no rain!! After 
the second week of drill, they were 
all promised a nice warm chair 
to sit in in room 218, Engineer­
ing Hall, to answer a few ques­
tions about drill, and a test any­
way on November 14th. Ever since 
that day the test papers have been 
rotting in the office, just waiting 
for that rainy day when eager (?) 
hands would clutch them and pore 
over them to attempt the fath­
oming of the printing.
At this writing, things look very 
black for the poor frosh. But this 
isn’t the first time. Many are the 
times when the ROTC enthusi­
asts have almost had heart failure 
as it rained Wednesday night, or 
looked gray and threatening 
Thursday (drill day), or weather 
reports have been consistently 
against their best wishes. Last 
week the test day was moved 
ahead a week to November 7th. 
NoW it looks bad for this week. 
At the time of this reading, the 
tests, or drill, if the freshies are 
lucky, will be over. If things do 
take a turn for the worst, good 
luck—even if your tests were yes­
terday!
Story of Deep South 
Follows 66Craig’s Wife99
Following along in the success­
ful footsteps of “Craig’s Wife,” 
the Drama Department is already 
rehearsing its second production 
of the season, “The House of Con­
nelly,” written by Paul Green, 
author of the Pulitizer Prize play, 
“Abraham’s Bosom.”
The play will run from Tues­
day, November 12 to Tuesday, No­
vember 19, in the Little Theater. 
Tickets will be ready for distribu­
tion in the Registrar’s Office on 
Tuesday, November 5. There will 
be a matinee on Friday, November 
15, at 3:30, for which no tickets 
will be required.
The scene of “The House of 
Connelly” is the deep south in 
1905. The plot involves the de­
cline and disintegration of an aris­
tocratic southern family and the 
regeneration of the son, Will Con­
nelly, through the influence of one 
of the tenant farmer girls, Patsy 
Tate. A very unusual romnace 
develops between Will and Patsy. 
The opposition of his mother and 
sister to this romance, and the en­
trance into the story of another 
southern girl, further complicate 
the plot. It is hard to classify 
“The House of Connelly” into cus­
tomary dramatic categories; it is, 
however, a serious, even tragic, 
study of the disintegration of old 
southern aristocracy. The plot in­
volves no central figure—every­
one is important.
The show is being directed by
Mary Morris, who played the role 
of Mrs. Connelly when the play 
was first produced by the Group 
Theater in New York in 1913. The 
part of her son, Will Connelly, was 
played by Franchot Tone. The 
play features large group sing­
ing of planation songs and negro 
work songs offstage; there is also 
other music and dancing. The 
make-up department will have the 
unusual experience of preparing 8 
or 10 “darkies” for the cast.
“The House of Connelly” lends 
itself admirably to the expression 
of ingenuity in set designing, since 
there at;e two outdoor scenes and 
one indoor scene in the story. The 
exterior sets are being designed 
by John Blankenchip, ’41; the in­
terior, typically southern, by Mil­
ton Howarth, ’43.
Cast as Patsy Tate are Shirley 
Brown, ’41, and Molly van Amer- 
ingen, ’42; as Mrs. Connelly, Septa 
Sanderson, ’43 and Ruth Fischer, 
’42; Will Connelly, William Eythe, 
’41 and Herbert Browar, ’41; Uncle 
Bob, Jerry Kurtz, ’41, and Carl 
Betz, ’41; Big Sis, Hazel Shermet, 
’41 and Rose Marie Ellis, ’43; Big 
Sue, Esther Coryell, ’41 and Bar­
bara Burns, ’43; Geraldine Con­
nelly, Betty McCarthy, ’43 and 
Eleanor Weal, ’43; Evelyn Con­
nelly, Ruth Orr, ’41 and Betsey 
Dunckhorst, ’42; Virginia Buchan­
an, Marisse Forbes, ’42 and Lillian 
Bowman, ’43. _______

In locating the home of any one 
of the boys, let X denote the num­
ber of miles west and Y the num­
ber of miles south of the college. 
Then X and Y in each case must 
be whole numbers which are the 
legs, of a right triangle with hy­
potenuse 65. Remembering that 
the square of the hypotenuse 
equals the sum of the squares of 
the other two sides, We find by 
trial that the possible locations for 
the homes are (16, 63), (25, 60), 
(33, 56), (39, 52), (52, 39),
(56, 33), (60, 25), and (63, 16), 
where the first number in each 
pair gives the value of X, and the 
second, that of Y. There are thus 
eight possible locations; four of 
them, one for each family, must 
be selected so as to satisfy the oth­
er conditions of the problem. Let 
us represent the eight points in 
the order in which they are given 
above by the letters A to H, and 
make a table of distances (by
road)betweeneverypairof
points:
BCDEFGH
A 12243460708294
B122248587082
C1036465870
D26364860
E102234
F1224

The distance 34 miles from the 
Jonses’ to the Fords’ occurs twice 
in the table; we shall begin by as­
suming that A and D are two of 
the four required points. (If in­
stead we started by taking E and 
H as two of the required points
the ultimate result would be mere­
ly to change distance west into 
distances south, and vice versa). 
Next, the distance from the Fords’ 
to the Smiths’ is given as 10 miles. 
Thus the distance also occurs 
twice in the table, once as DC and 
once as EF. Here we must choose 
DC, since it must have one point 
(namely, the Fords’ home) in 
common with the preceding dis­
tance it now follows that the 
Jones’ home is at A—(16, 63), the 
Fords’ at D—(39, 52), and the 
Smiths’ at C—(33, 56), The dis­
tance of 12 miles from the Smiths’ 
to the Blacks’ must begin at C 
and therefore is CB, so that the 
Blacks’ home is at B—(25, 60).
Now the distance from the col­
lege to each of the homes may be 
easily written down: Jones 79, 
Black 85, Smith 89 and Ford 91. 
Since George had to go six miles 
further than Will, but six miles 
less than Dick, it is easily seen 
that the full names must be Will 
Jones, George Black, Henry Smith 
and Dick Ford.
