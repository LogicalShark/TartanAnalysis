One of Carnegie Mellon 
University’s most excit-
ing and most critically 
acclaimed events, the 
Carnegie Mellon Interna-
tional Film Festival, is un-
derway. Beginning March 
22 and running until April 
8, the festival will include 
a vast array of ?lms from 
across the world, as well as 
moderated discussions, a 
short ?lm competition, and 
even Q&As with directors.
The Carnegie Mel-
lon International Film 
Festival is a unique event in 
Pittsburgh, bringing togeth-
er ?lms from all over the 
world to convey a cohesive 
theme and paint a fascinat-
ing picture of the world of 
?lm.
The Tartan interviewed 
Jolanta Lion, the director of 
the festival and the assistant 
director of the Humanities 
Center, who also mentioned 
that this festival is the only 
international ?lm festival in 
the world “where students 
are behind coordinating 
and bringing premieres of 
world-class cinema to its 
festival lineup.”
The various events that 
comprise this distinct festi-
val aren’t just held here at 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
but also across 
Pittsburgh at 
Carlow University 
and at the 
Carnegie Museum 
of Art Theatre. 
That being said, 
receptions and 
the majority of 
screenings take 
place right here 
on campus, in 
McConomy Auditorium.
This year’s festival 
has the theme and title 
“Faces of (In)equality.” 
Lion describes that 
themes are chosen “based 
on how globally relevant 
[they are] and if people all 
over the world are currently 
telling stories that relate to 
the theme.”
In the wake of the 
Donald Trump’s 2016 elec-
tion, the “current social and 
political climate regarding 
race, gender, nationality” 
has changed, Lion explains. 
Situations like the “Muslim 
ban, the Women’s March, 
and Charlottesville [have] 
heightened our awareness 
of the concept of equality,” 
she continues.
The festival does its very 
best to look at these potent 
societal issues, like that 
of inequality, and see how 
they are being represented 
across the world in ?lm. This 
is a tall order for those who 
select the ?lms.
In order to be included 
in the festival, ?lms need to 
have “not yet been screened 
in Pittsburgh,” be connected 
to the theme, and are re-
viewed with careful scruti-
ny by the festival’s program-
ming team, Lion explained.
The selected ?lms for 
this year certainly ?t into 
this, with ?lms subjects in-
cluding the effects of the 
Charlottesville alt-right pro-
tests, how an Indian doc-
tor broke into the world of 
medicine, the marginaliza-
tion of people of color in the 
United States, how mass mi-
gration changes the world, 
and countless others.
Some past years’ 
festival themes have been 
“Faces of Work” in 2015, 
“Faces of Migration” 
in 2011, and “Faces of 
Mechanization” in 2008. 
Looking forward, Lion 
stresses the importance of 
“forming new relationships 
with [Carnegie Mellon] 
schools and departments, 
other schools and univer-
sities, and local organiza-
tions,” thereby connecting 
to the Pittsburgh commu-
nity and being able to “pro-
voke conversation across a 
more diversi?ed audience.”
Such an interesting 
event does not go by with-
out attracting praise from 
throughout the community. 
Barry Paris, ?lm critic for 
the Pittsburgh 
Post Gazette calls 
the festival his 
“annual favor-
ite, due to the 
excellence of the 
choices by its di-
rector, Jolanta 
Lion, who de-
serves an Oscar 
in general.”
Likewise, Michael 
Machosky of the 
Pittsburgh Tribune 
Review describes it as 
“one of Pittsburgh’s most 
unusual and consistently 
interesting ?lm festivals.” 
Such praise and acclaim 
comes at the cost of the tire-
less work done by director 
Jolanta Lion and many stu-
dent volunteers who work 
to provide the community 
such a well-run event.
If you’ve not been able 
to attend any of the screen-
ings, Q&As, or discussions 
in these past few weeks, 
the festival will continue to 
run until Sunday, April 8. 
Tickets for regular admis-
sion screenings are $10, 
and $5 for students with 
appropriate identi?cation.
Some forthcoming 
events include a screening 
of Risk, a Laura Poitras 
?lm on Julian Assange on 
April 4, and the next day, 
a screening of Mali Blues, a 
Lutz Gregor ?lm on Malian 
musicians, among other 
?lms as well.
The festival will conclude 
on Sunday, April 8, with a 
screening of Human Flow, a 
?lm directed by renowned 
Chinese protest artist Ai 
Weiwei, as well as a panel 
discussion of the ?lm and a 
closing night reception.
These ?lms, stylistically 
and topically diverse, 
combine in the festival set-
ting to create a fascinat-
ing picture of the world 
in which we live, and do 
so with emphasis on both 
equality and inequality. 
This focus allows attendees 
to “observe, discuss, and ex-
perience international cul-
tures,” the festival website 
states.
In the continuously 
globalizing world we 
occupy, understanding and 
experiencing other cultures 
can be imperative to our so-
ciety as a whole. Though not 
the only means to improving 
and connecting the world, 
events like the Carnegie 
Mellon International Film 
Festival certainly help. We 
are lucky to have it here in 
Pittsburgh.

Newt Gingrich, Fox 
News contributor and 
former Speaker of the 
House, made a little-pub-
licized visit to Carnegie 
Mellon University this 
week. He was invited by 
Director Kiron Skinner, the 
director of the Washington 
Semester Program, the 
Institute for Politics and 
Strategy, and the Institute 
for Strategic Analysis at 
Carnegie Mellon. Director 
Skinner worked with 
Gingrich on his 2012 presi-
dential campaign and, in 
Dec. 2017, began work-
ing as a foreign policy 
contributor for Fox News.
According to a press 
release by the Institute 
for Strategic Analysis, 
“[Gingrich] spent a full 
afternoon being briefed by 
a lineup of distinguished 
[Carnegie Mellon] faculty 
on artificial intelligence 
(AI) and participated in 
roundtable discussions 
on how to bring together 
policy and technology.”
Gingrich published a 
column about his experi-
ence titled “Newt Gingrich: 
The future is amazing 
— Here’s an incredible 
glimpse of what awaits us,” 
mentioning technologies 
such as “a robotic assistant 
[to] reduce the invasive-
ness of heart surgery” and 
new medical analysis tools.
He also discussed the 
societal changes that could 
be brought about by new 
technologies, emphasizing 
the service jobs that could 
be displaced by AI and the 
need to assist workers in 
learning the new skills fa-
cilitated by technological 
advancements.
Additionally, Gingrich 
called for caution but 
optimism for future 
technological progress, 
writing that what he saw 
at Carnegie Mellon could 
constitute “‘glimmerings of 
the future,” which he de-
scribes as “ideas, events, or 
developments that...might 
evolve into something im-
portant.” Gingrich wrote 
that his experiences work-
ing with computing pio-
neer Pete Jensen and read-
ing the books Future Shock 
and The Third Wave trained 
him to be on the lookout 
for potential “glimmer-
ings,” such as nanotechnol-
ogy and fracking, the latter 
of which inspired him to 
make a documentary and 
write a book.
Gingrich concludes that 
the development of AI at 
Carnegie Mellon could be 
one of such “glimmerings,” 
with the potential to “give 
us new capabilities and 
new insights in ways we 
have never imagined.” That 
being said, Gingrich does 
echo the aforementioned 
fear many hold that “arti-
ficial intelligence will dis-
place many traditional ser-
vice jobs,” a societal shift 
that will necessitate a “re-
think [of] adult education.”
Gingrich’s visit and 
subsequent opinion piece 
for Fox News shows that 
he not only sees the future 
as something bright due 
to some of the innova-
tive work being done 
here at Carnegie Mellon 
University, but also recog-
nizes that these innovations 
will come at a cost.
One cost he does not 
mention is the disputed 
negatives of shale fracking 
for natural gas, a technol-
ogy that has allowed the 
United States to be more 
energy efficient, but one 
that has had major growing 
pains including improper 
waste management, in-
creased seismic activity in 
areas of drilling, and well 
water contamination — 
although he compared 
fracking’s benefits to the 
benefits of the technolo-
gies being developed here 
at Carnegie Mellon.
His equating of fracking 
technology to the work 
being done in nanotechnol-
ogy or AI here at Carnegie 
Mellon University is a 
somewhat dubious claim, 
as fracking has certainly 
not been as flawless as the 
portrait he paints, especial-
ly as he uses these points 
to bolster the claim that 
former President Barack 
Obama was “of course... 
totally wrong” in regard 
to the technology, simul-
taneously advertising his 
past documentary on the 
subject matter.
All this being said, 
it is important to have 
influential personalities 
like Gingrich aware of 
the work being done 
in places like Carnegie 
Mellon University. Regard-
less of political affilia-
tion, an understanding of 
breakthrough technolo-
gies and the future of the 
workforce and economy 
are vital for all to under-
stand. Gingrich’s visit, his 
working relationship with 
Dr. Kiron Skinner, and 
his writing for Fox News 
all contribute to the vital 
discussion of how tech-
nological advancements 
and public policy consid-
erations can and must 
intersect.

Special to The Tartan
The third and ?nal 
event of the Undergraduate 
Student Senate’s First 
Lectures Series is being held 
on April 26, 2018 from 8 to 
9 p.m. in the Connan room. 
The First Lectures Series 
is run by the Campus Life 
Committee of the Student 
Senate to capture the 
life lessons, experiences, 
and perspectives of the 
graduating senior class as a 
parallel to Randy Pausch’s 
Last Lecture.
So far this semester, 
we have heard from Justis 
Hibshman, Kevin Wainczak, 
Gaby Cach, and Shreya 
Desikan. This ?nal event 
will feature Tara Stentz and 
Apeksha Atal, two seniors 
with truly exceptional and 
inspiring stories.
Tara Stentz is an 
electrical and computer 
engineering major who is 
planning on working for the 
Uber Advanced Technology 
Group on their self-driving 
cars after graduation. She 
will be talking about how 
she had always loved math 
since she was a little girl, but 
didn’t feel like a good ?t for 
Carnegie Mellon’s Electrical 
and Chemical Engineering 
major, because she was 
also a theater girl and no 
one in her major shared her 
interests. She will be em-
phasizing the importance of 
embracing uniqueness and 
refusing to hide parts of her-
self, even when she feels like 
she doesn’t belong.
Apeksha Atal is a biology 
and english major who is 
planning on spending the 
summer traveling and work-
ing on business analytics 
and content development 
at her mom’s company and 
working on publishing the 
novella she is writing for 
her senior thesis. She will be 
talking about her experienc-
es with the concept of per-
manence, through the lens 
of her process of choosing a 
tattoo. She will be exploring 
the role of certainty and the 
lack thereof in her emotion-
al, social, occupational, and 
academic life, as well as how 
she has come to embrace 
growth and the fact that the 
past cannot be changed.
Come support these 
speakers and learn from 
their experiences by coming 
to the event on April 26! Any 
questions may be directed 
to Rohini Sinha (rsinha1@
andrew.cmu.edu). If you 
would like to be noti?ed

EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
Closing in on the six-
month anniversary of 
Hurricane Maria’s landfall 
in Puerto Rico, a group of 
Carnegie Mellon students 
led by Tiffany Taulton, a 
graduate student in Heinz 
College majoring in public 
policy, visited the island 
on an “alternative spring 
break.” The group, be-
sides bringing donations 
to help the island, spent 
the week helping some of 
the most vulnerable seg-
ments of the Puerto Rican 
population and learning 
about the fragile nature of 
the island’s natural ecosys-
tems. In an interview with 
The Tartan, Taulton gave 
a summary of the trip’s ac-
tivities and her reflections 
on the island’s current 
condition.
Taulton, who spent 
part of her childhood in 
Puerto Rico when her 
father was stationed there, 
immediately noticed im-
provements as her flight 
approached the island. 
“Flying over San Juan, I no-
ticed there did not seem to 
be quite as many blue tarps 
[temporary roofs for homes 
damaged by the hurricane] 
as there had been when 
I’d last come in November 
[with Carnegie Mellon stu-
dent Rosana Guernica],” 
she recalled, which made 
her feel that “there had 
been some progress” on 
the island. “Even the trees 
seemed to be trying to leaf 
out,” she said. But, it was 
evident that the recovery 
was still in progress be-
cause she still saw many 
blue tarps and broken 
branches on the roads once 
she had landed.
On their first full day, the 
group visited Caño Martín 
Peña, a tidal channel that 
connects San Juan Bay to 
Laguna San Jose and Lagu-
na Los Corozos, where they 
learned about its history, 
ecological significance, 
and the many issues plagu-
ing the area and its resi-
dents. According to the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency’s website, this 
tidal channel is heavily 
polluted from waste mate-
rial and sewage that gets 
discharged directly into it. 
Residents near the channel 
are exposed to these 
harmful chemicals due to 
flooding from the lack of 
adequate drainage, caus-
ing everything from skin 
lesions to asthma to cancer. 
One part of the channel — 
which in the past had been 
over 200 feet wide — was 
so heavily damaged that it 
was now only two feet wide 
and about one foot deep, 
and it even hosted a mini-
forest of small trees.
“It was heartbreak-
ing to see all the turtles 
swimming in the stagnant, 
smelly water that bubbled 
from all the organic ma-
terial that filled it,” said 
Taulton. She remembered 
that “one student asked 
why they didn’t just cut 
down the trees [in the 
mini-forest] and unblock 
the stream. The guide said 
that the area was so toxic 
that you had to wear a 
hazmat suit to work in it, 
and no one could touch it 
until the Army Corps of 
Engineers finished their 
study and Congress re-
leased the funds to begin 
the dredging.” The combi-
nation of government red 
tape and the island’s finan-
cial woes meant that the 
residents were hoping that 
the restoration of the chan-
nel would be done by 2029.
As government 
assistance to improve the 
channel’s condition and 
install sewage infrastruc-
ture has been practically 
nonexistent, the eight 
communities there — 
known as “G-8” — have 
formed their own group, 
the Caño Martín Peña Land 
Trust, to improve the en-
vironment and prevent 
gentrification of the neigh-
borhoods in the midst of 
Puerto Rico’s economic 
crisis. The trust was award-
ed the 2015 U.N. Habitat 
Award for its work.
Taulton said that the 
Carnegie Mellon students 
went on a bicycle tour, 
“learning about the solar 
panels and computers that 
were donated to commu-
nity centers that the G-8 
volunteers used to help the 
largely illiterate residents 
complete their FEMA forms 
and charge their phones 
so they could check on 
their family members after 
the hurricane.” While the 
larger-scale restoration 
plans dragged on, the 
community has been mak-
ing its own efforts to im-
prove the landscape, such 
as by planting flowers 
along the water to beautify 
the area and keep people 
from dumping trash there. 
However, the group didn’t 
see the flowers because 
the hurricane had stripped 
them away. “There was just 
bare ground and an algae-
filled stream when we 
arrived,” she said.
However, it was not all 
bad news. A success sto-
ry from the Martin Pena 
communities was their 
recycling enterprise. It 
was so successful that the 
government of San Juan 
contracted it to reduce 
the waste output of other 
communities.
The next location 
they visited was Utuado, 
a municipality located 
in the mountains where 
Hurricane Maria left the 
island. It sustained some of 
the worst damage from the 
hurricane — bridges and 
roads were destroyed, and 
many of the residents did 
not yet have electricity re-
stored when the Carnegie 
Mellon group arrived. 
There, the students 
learned about ecotourism 
on a tour with Jorge Perez, 
who runs Batey Zip-line 
Adventures. They hiked 
on coffee plantations and 
across a suspension bridge 
built by Perez, zip-lined, 
and rappelled down a cliff 
to a riverbed where they 
swam and kayaked into a 
cave. 
“Sadly, the cave exit 
was blocked by debris that 
had been swept down by 
the swollen river, so we 
couldn’t go all the way 
through. But, that gave us 
more time to appreciate 
the spooky darkness and 
the sounds. We heard the 
familiar coqui, the island’s 
signature special frog — 
smaller than your pinky 
nail but with a voice that 
would make you swear it 
was 20 feet tall,” Taulton 
recalled. However, some-
thing that was noticeably 
absent were the bats — 
many of which were likely 
either killed during the 
storm or flew away.
The next day they 
helped Perez on his farm. 
She explained in the 
interview that not only was 
Perez’s farm produce en-
tirely organic and chemical 
free, Perez had developed 
a system of raised beds to 
get around the rocky soil, 
keep plants watered, and 
prevent rains from wash-
ing the farm away. He also 
raised worms for the soil 
and his wife used the veg-
etables in the cafe they 
owned. He worried that 
with the next hurricane 
season approaching, the 
island could plunge into 
deeper crisis with so many 
still recovering from Maria. 
The students helped build 
four new raised beds on his 
farm.
After that, they helped 
a farmer in Arecibo, Jaime 
Jordan, clear his field of 
invasive weeds that took 
root after Maria. “His fam-
ily lost their house as a 
result of the hurricane, 
and they have since been 
living in his toolshed. He 
and his wife were embar-
rassed by their condition 
and did not want to have 
us help them at first, but 
then they decided that as 
students, we were men-
tally prepared for what 
we would see and would 
want to learn,” Taulton 
remembered. Yet, when 
asked what more the stu-
dents could do to help him, 
Jordan only answered that 
others needed help more 
than he did. “[Jordan] felt 
the most important thing 
we could do was to tell oth-
ers about what we saw, and 
to teach people about the 
importance of protecting 
the islands’ water system...
[he] wants people to come 
back to the mountains and 
care for the land,” Taulton 
stated.
The group also met 
with faculty and students 
from the University of 
Puerto Rico in Mayaguez 
(UPRM), where both the 
Carnegie Mellon group 
and the UPRM group pre-
sented their research on 
sustainability. The faculty 
at UPRM also took them 
to three communities in 
Anasco, where they helped 
clear a community garden 
of debris and weeds and 
donated their clothing to 
help those in need. “The 
teachers were so grateful 
for our decision to come to 
Puerto Rico to help after 
the hurricane that they in-
sisted that we cancel our 
reservations at the univer-
sity dorm and stay in their 
luxury apartments in the 
famous beach town of Cabo 
Rojo!” Taulton said.
The students helped 
repaint a school to convert 
it to a community center 
in Humacao, where Maria 
had entered the island 
and where many residents 
still had no electricity. 
“Painting the school may 
not have felt as sexy as 
farming, but it was a nice 
change to be out of the hot 
sun for a while!” Taulton 
said. A small subset of the 
group also went to meet 
with Puerto Rico Off Grid 
Solar Relief, a group led by 
Alberto Casas that aimed to 
restore power using solar 
panels and bought freez-
ers for those who needed 
it. “Many of the cables and 
connectors for the panels...
are very expensive to get in 
Puerto Rico, so we brought 
a suitcase full of them that 
I had bought online using 
funds that were donated to 
us. [Casas] was so shocked 
and happy to see them, 
that he completely stopped 
talking for a few minutes 
while he opened up all the 
boxes,” Taulton said.
The group was amazed 
by the resilience and ac-
complishments of the 
Puerto Ricans they met, 
despite the lack of federal 
aid some areas have re-
ceived. “People in com-
munities were rallying to-
gether, but with another 
hurricane season just a few 
months away, and no large-
scale federal government 
response on the horizon, 
they will continue to need 
help from ordinary people 
like us,” she said. The cam-
pus community can learn 
more about Puerto Rico’s 
situation and help out in a 
variety of ways. San Juan 
mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz 
will be attending Energy 
Week and will be present 
at a fundraiser event for

Earlier in March, 
the Board of Trustees 
voted unanimously to 
make Farnam Jahanian 
the 10th President of 
Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity. After a long 
and combined effort 
between student lead-
ers and the board, then 
Interim President Ja-
hanian remained the fa-
vorite for the job, as he 
has served as the interim 
president for the past se-
mester. Before serving 
as the 10th president, 
he served as the Provost 
and Chief Academic Of-
ficer.
He started his path 
to leadership by serv-
ing as National Science 
Foundation Directorate 
for Computer and 
Information Science 
and Engineering. In this 
position, he managed 
a massive budget and 
pushed to increase ac-
cess and innovation in 
technology and science. 
Though his alma mater 
is the University of Texas 
at Austin, he has been 
devoted to Carnegie 
Mellon for decades and 
made great efforts to 
increase the quality and 
consistency of educa-
tion for all students on 
campus.
Many students view 
him as a genuine and 
charismatic person that 
cares deeply about the 
issues surrounding the 
students and faculty and 
staff. John Solomon, a 
sophomore in chemical 
engineering, said "I've 
talked with Jahanian 
once, and he has a genu-
ine commitment to the 
school."
Some of these issues 
concern campus life as 
well as financial aid. A 
student, who wished 
to remain anonymous, 
found that "it would be 
great if he could contrib-
ute more funds towards 
reducing student tuition 
costs." However, there 
is reason to believe that 
President Jahanian will 
be able to tackle those 
issues directly. 
For many sopho-
mores and freshmen, 
President Jahanian is 
the only president they 
really know. When asked 
about what they re-
membered about former 
President Subra Suresh, 
an anonymous sopho-
more said that "the 
only thing I remember 
about president Subra 
Suresh are the memes." 
However, perhaps, this 
is an indictment of the 
transparency of the of-
fice of president and the 
responsibilities of the 
president. Pavi Bhatter, a 
freshman in information 
systems, believes that 
"[President] Jahanian 
will help to foster posi-
tive relations between 
the administration and 
[the student body]."
Thought students 
may not feel a daily 
impact from the deci-
sions of the office of 
the president, he has 
the support of a student 
body eager to see his 
plans for the university.

We need more equal coverage in the media 
Today, it seems that 
acts of violence are so 
commonplace in our 
lives that we have 
almost become ac-
customed to them. 
Acts of terror, spe-
cifically, have be-
come such typical 
parts of our lives 
that — while they 
still raise ques-
tions of “why?,” 
“how?,” and “when 
will this end?” — 
they are now unsur-
prising stories on our 
news broadcasts and Twitter 
feeds. But, what about how 
these events are covered? 
How has media coverage im-
pacted what we see, what we 
know, and how we perceive 
what has happened?
In March 2018, Austin, TX, 
was terrorized by suspected 
bomber Mark Conditt who 
killed himself in the seventh and 
final bombing on March 21. Cov-
erage of these attacks has been 
widespread in the media from 
The New York Times to The Atlan-
tic. However, the amount of pub-
lic discourse has been nowhere 
near that of the bombings 
in Paris, Brussels, dur-
ing the Boston Mara-
thon, or in Orlando. 
The language and 
methods used to 
cover the bomb-
ings and Conditt 
himself have also 
been markedly 
different than 
others. Discus-
sion about how 
coverage differs 
has also been ig-
nited by the fact 
that the two vic-
tims of the bomb-
ings are African 
Americans.
Conditt has been described as 
a white Christian, a “nerdy” man 
from a “godly family.” While all 
these terms may be accurate, 
a New York Times tweet high-
lighted these facts — a distinct 
difference from how the media 
covers acts of terror by Muslims 
or victims of color.
According to a 2017 study 
from Georgia State University, 
an attack by a Muslim perpetra-
tor receives four and a half times 
more coverage than an attack by 
a non-Muslim perpetrator. The 
study analyzed the coverage of 
89 attacks and found that, while 
only 12 percent of the attacks 
were by Muslims, those at-
tacks by Muslims received 
44 percent of the total cov-
erage of all 89 attacks. 
Coverage was also much 
more widespread if the 
perpetrator was Muslim 
and foreign-born.
After the Boston 
Marathon bombing 
on April 13, 2013, The 
New York Post pub-
lished its April 18 is-
sue with an image of 
two young men with 
the large headline “Bag 
Men,” claiming they were 
the perpetrators of the bomb-
ing ostensibly because of their 
outward appearance. The real 
bombers, brothers Dzhokhar 
Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsar-
naev, were discovered, and the 
two falsely accused  men even-
tually settled a defamation suit 
with the paper.
Rarely does anyone call a 
white perpetrator a terrorist. 
Since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, 
the terms “terrorist” and “terror-
ism” have become part of Ameri-
can lexicon, but associated with 
Muslims. The fact that labeling 
an otherwise innocent Muslim a 
terrorist is easier than rightfully 
calling a white person a terror-
ist speaks volumes about the 
stereotypes and views America 
has about Muslims.
This racist coverage also ex-
tends to shooters and African 
Americans. White shooters are 
considered lone wolves, called 
mentally ill and given layered 
backstories, in an attempt to un-
derstand and humanize them. 
While these pro?les may have 
some validity by seeking to under-
stand the psychology of these 
men, this sympathy is not 
given to Muslim or black 
shooters. They are imme-
diately called terrorists 
and thugs, indicted on 
malicious intent rath-
er than outside forces 
out of their control.
Even black vic-
tims receive more 
negative coverage 
than white shoot-
ers. Young teenage 
African Americans 
victims are called 
men and given part of the 
blame. The most widely circu-
lated photo of Trayvon Martin is 
black and white, of him looking 
blankly at the camera in a white 
hoodie. What if instead of this 
image we saw another photo-
graph of Martin in a red Hollister 
t-shirt and smiling? Would that 
have altered our perception of 
him? We’ll never know.
Three months after the Boston 
Marathon bombing, bomber 
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the brother 
who survived and stood trial, 
was on the cover of Rolling Stone. 
The headline called him the 
bomber and a monster, 
but the photograph 
itself was more posi-
tive — it was well lit 
and relatively flat-
tering, with Tsar-
naev’s hair flowing 
in curling tresses. 
While Tsarnaev 
is Muslim, he is 
of Chechen de-
scent — the origi-
nal Caucasians. 
The question of 
whether he was 
white or not was 
debated as his trial 
began. The simple 
fact that he was fea-
tured on the cover of a 
prestigious cultural magazine 
like a celebrity has enough im-
plications of slanted coverage.
After the shooting of nine 
African Americans in a Charles-
ton, SC, church in June 2015, 
The Washington Post made the 
argument about the inequality 
of how the media covers mass 
violence, pointing out the cover-
age of shooter Dylann Roof. How-
ever, almost three years later, 
media coverage has not changed. 
In a press conference after Aus-
tin bomber Conditt’s death, the 
Austin Police Chief called him a 
“challenged young man.” Only 
eight days later, after extensive 
criticism, did the police chief call 
Conditt a domestic terrorist.
This needs to change. The 
way the media covers perpetra-
tors of mass violence is directly 
connected to how we view them 
as a society. These immediate 
racist connections we make 
by equating Muslims to ter-
rorists and black people to 
criminals are ingrained in 
our minds. The idea that 
America is past racism is 
not a moot point. It re-
mains an immutable part 
of our society. The media 
directly impacts how we 
think — it’s how we get our 
news, how we learn about what’s 
going on in the world. The in-
formation we receive influences 
how we perceive the world. In 
order to become a more equal 
society, we must move towards 
more equal media coverage of 
atrocious attacks.
Facebook scandal: data, dishonesty, and decisions 
ANNA BOYLE
Art Editor
Have you liked Carnegie 
Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens? 
If so, Facebook knows about it. 
Facebook collects data from all 
of your activity, from likes to 
personal information to events 
you attend. Only recently, how-
ever, did we ?nd out the extent to 
which this data is used to manip-
ulate us. A recent scandal involv-
ing Facebook has revealed an un-
precedented invasion of privacy 
that is raising a serious question 
of how we, as a society, are going 
to deal with data privacy.
According to The New York 
Times, it all started with Aleksandr 
Kogan, a Russian-American psy-
chology professor at Cambridge 
University. Kogan received permis-
sion from Facebook to collect data 
for academic research. He created 
an app, thisisyourdigitallife, that 
paid Facebook users to answer a 
survey. However, the app didn’t 
only collect the data of users who 
consented to the survey; it scraped 
data from every user’s network 
of friends, expanding the data set 
from 270,000 pro?les to 50 million.
Enter Cambridge Analytica, 
a political data ?rm. Cambridge 
Analytica bought the data from 
Kogan and started categorizing 
the users with a complex tech-
nique developed at Cambridge 
University. They used the data to 
build highly speci?c personality 
pro?les. With an unprecedented 
understanding of their target 
audience, Cambridge Analytica 
crafted advertisements and po-
litical campaign materials that 
delved into the heart of each 
user’s fears and beliefs, alleg-
edly in?uencing the Brexit deci-
sion and swinging the election in 
Donald Trump’s favor.
According to The Guardian, 
Facebook’s policy “allowed only a 
collection of friends’ data to im-
prove user experience in the app 
and barred it being sold on or 
used for advertising.” Cambridge 
Analytica and Kogan clearly vio-
lated these terms, and Facebook 
removed the app from the site in 
2015. They also requested that 
everyone with access to the user 
data to delete it immediately.
Facebook’s actions may seem 
reassuring, but they were only 
the bare minimum. There were 
several steps Facebook could’ve 
taken to ensure user security, but 
they failed to do so. For example, 
they did not warn their users 
that their data may have been 
collected, even though a major-
ity of American states have laws 
requiring noti?cation in cases of 
data breach. Facebook may have 
escaped this regulation through 
their insistent claims that it was 
not a breach, but quibbling about 
terminology brings very little 
comfort to compromised users.
Furthermore, Facebook failed 
to certify that the data was de-
leted. According to Christopher 
Wylie, the former Director of Re-
search at Cambridge Analytica, 
Facebook only sent a letter ask-
ing him to destroy the data. The 
Guardian reports that Wylie did 
not answer the letter for weeks, 
and Facebook did nothing to 
pursue an answer. When Wylie 
agreed to destroy the data, Face-
book took him at his word, failing 
to follow up with forensic checks 
on his computers or storage.
“That to me was the most 
astonishing thing,” Wylie said. 
“They waited two years and did 
absolutely nothing to check that 
the data was deleted. All they 
asked me to do was tick a box on 
a form and post it back.”
Tensions about data pri-
vacy have been simmering for 
years, and now they are burst-
ing into the spotlight. News of 
the scandal recently found its 
way through dozens of repu-
table news sites. Senators and 
public ?gures weighed in to 
voice their concerns. Facebook’s 
shares plummeted. According to 
The New York Times, the British 
Information Commissioner’s Of-
?ce is doing an inquiry into the 
relationship between Cambridge 
Analytica and Facebook.
Now, we have an important 
decision to make about data 
privacy. We can hand wave the 
scandal away, claiming that it’s 
just part of using social media. 
Several people I know are tempt-
ed to do so, saying things like, “I 
already ?gured stuff like that was 
happening behind the scenes. It’s 
not that big of a deal.”
But, it is a big deal. Our current 
state of politics can attest to that.
The problem isn’t that ads have 
a target audience, it’s that the ads 
are meticulously crafted using ill-
gained information. It’s not that 
our decisions are in?uenced, it’s 
that millions of decisions are in?u-
enced to sway the course of politics 
and history. It’s not that Facebook 
has our information, it’s that they 
treat it carelessly and let it fall into 
unscrupulous hands. It’s not that 
Facebook made a mistake, it’s that 
the company was careless, skirting 
laws and turning a blind eye in the 
pursuit of power and pro?ts.
Of course, some responsibility 
lies on the shoulders of the users. 
We have to be discerning when 
dealing with advertisements 
and political propaganda, criti-
cally engaging with the material 
that ?nds its way onto our Face-
book feed. But, we also should 
be able to browse social media 
without worrying that liking a 
page about curly fries will result 
in an onslaught of hyper speci?c 
campaign ads.
So yes, we could dismiss the 
scandal. Or we could ?ght for 
higher levels of transparency, 
increased protections of privacy, 
and data use regulations. It is 
within our rights to demand a 
higher quality product from a 
company that serves our needs, 
and it is practically our duty to 
engage with a tech giant that 
wields real in?uence over the 
state of our world. If Facebook 
agrees, then I’ll happily scroll 
down my feed. If not, then there 
are other ways to know what my 
friends are up to.
I’ve made my decision. Now 
I’m just waiting for Facebook to 
make theirs.

The word activists are looking for is “rights,” not “privilege”
LYDIA GREEN
About a year ago, I wrote 
an article in The Tartan about 
race and privilege. In the piece, 
I argued that all white people 
are inherently privileged and 
systemically racist. The article 
seemed to be mostly positively 
received, but I found that I had 
to explain and defend my ar-
gument to some of my friends 
— ones who strike me as good 
people who genuinely care 
about correcting systems of op-
pression — more than I had 
expected to, before they could 
get it. It seemed that the words 
“racist” and “privileged” meant 
something different to them 
than what I had intended.
After thinking more about 
activist language, I have come 
to the conclusion that the word 
“privilege” does not effectively 
communicate what activists 
want it to. In the word’s normal 
usage, a “privilege” is something 
extra that must be earned. Privi-
leges are different from rights 
in that they are unnecessary 
benefits. For instance, access 
to clean water is a right, while 
access to designer handbags is 
a privilege. When liberal activ-
ists describe “white privilege” 
or “male privilege,” however, 
we use the word “privilege,” but 
we are actually talking about 
things that are really more akin 
to human rights.
In Peggy McIntosh’s 1988 
essay “White Privilege: Un-
packing the Invisible Knap-
sack,” which helped originally 
popularize the term “white 
privilege,” McIntosh lists some 
of the everyday “privileges” she 
experiences as a white person: 
“I can turn on the television or 
open to the front page of the 
paper and see people of my 
race widely represented…I can 
go into a music shop and count 
on finding the music of my race 
represented, into a supermarket 
and find the staple foods that 
fit with my cultural traditions, 
into a hairdresser’s 
shop and find some-
one who can cut my 
hair...I can be sure 
that if I need legal 
or medical help, my 
race will not work 
against me.”
For the most part, 
McIntosh’s list con-
sists of things that every 
American deserves and every 
person needs to live a happy, 
healthy, fulfilling life — that 
is, rights — but McIntosh re-
fers to them as “privileges.” 
Calling these sorts of things 
“privileges” makes it sound 
like not everyone deserves 
them. The point of activism 
like McIntosh’s is to expand 
access to these necessary 
benefits, not to take away ac-
cess from the people who al-
ready have them, so it would 
intuitively make more sense 
to refer to these benefits as 
rights, which are universally 
deserved and should be freely 
given, rather than privileges, 
which are not deserved by 
anyone and must be earned.
Often times, when we talk 
about “privileges,” we really 
mean to be talking about a 
marginalized group’s disad-
vantages. For instance, a pop-
ular tweet from tech entrepre-
neur William LeGate about 
the recent Austin bombings, 
which primarily focuses on 
people of color, mentions white 
privilege but is actually discuss-
ing minority disadvantages. In 
his tweet, LeGate writes, “White 
privilege is when a single dog 
dying on a plane gets 10x the 
media coverage of [five] target-
ted [sic] bombings of minorities 
in America 
via domestic 
terrorist(s).” 
The main 
message of 
this tweet is 
that minori-
ties are dis-
advantaged 
in America 
because the 
media seems 
to care less 
about their lives 
than those of ani-
mals. Many people 
who read the tweet 
were confused, though, 
because LeGate uses the term 
“white privilege,” but there 
were no white people explic-
itly mentioned in the tweet to 
have that privilege. One person 
even jokingly replied, “The dog 
was white?” This confusion is 
caused by the fact that LeGate 
is thinking of a disadvantage 
but using the word “privilege.” 
LeGate’s tweet is not an iso-
lated instance, though. In this 
tweet, as well as in many other 
instances, it would be clearer to 
frame the discussion in terms 
of minority disadvantages or 
human rights violations rather 
than privileges.
While calling crucial benefits 
“privileges” is intuitively con-
tradictory to the aims of liberal 
activism, doing so fits neatly 
with the narrative of white 
supremacists and white na-
tionalists. These groups believe 
that the white race is under 
attack and must be violently 
defended. An example of this 
narrative in action is the phrase 
that has been circulating these 
communities lately, “It’s okay 
to be white,” which has been 
recently appearing on fliers at 
college and university campus-
es all over the U.S. This phrase 
shows what these white power 
groups think their opponents 
are arguing — “It’s okay to be 
white” has the underlying im-
plication that someone has said 
that it’s not okay to be white, 
since, otherwise, “It’s okay to 
be white” would not be a worth-
while statement to make. White 
power groups justify themselves 
with the idea that liberals hate 
white people and want to op-
press them. When we use the 
term “white privilege” to de-
scribe the human rights current-
ly not granted to people of color, 
we support this white power 
narrative because the word 
“privilege” inherently implies 
undeservedness.
Having these human rights 
that we call “privileges” respect-
ed by society is a good thing: it’s 
great that men can walk down a 
street without feeling afraid; it’s 
great that white children grow 
up with access to strong edu-
cation; it’s great that straight 
couples can show affection in 
public without fearing violent 
repercussions. What’s not great, 
what liberal activism focuses 
on, is that marginalized groups 
do not have access to these same 
freedoms. We must shape our 
language to reflect this purpose 
by calling these benefits “rights” 
rather than “privileges.”
With widespread systems of 
oppression still deeply pervasive 
in the world, liberal activists 
need widespread support and 
can’t afford to lose any of that 
support because of ineffective 
communication.

Animal testing is the least ethical way of ensuring public safety
MADELINE KIM
Thirteen Korean beauty 
products have been taken off 
the shelves after high levels of 
antimony were found. At first 
glance, this may appear to be 
just another recall. However, 
when looking at the recalled 
products, one can see that a sig-
nificant portion of them came 
from brands that perform ani-
mal testing. Animal testing is 
performed in hopes to ensure 
the safety of different products, 
whether it be new medicines 
or cleaning supplies or, in this 
case, cosmetics. However, the 
fact that brands that tested on 
animals appeared to have the 
same proportion of products 
recalled in comparison to their 
non-tested counterparts raises 
the question: how effective is 
animal testing?
The brand Amorepacific pro-
duced about half of the recalled 
products, yet it tests on animals 
“if animal testing is required 
or bound by local governments 
or laws.” Similarly, many other 
brands on the list, such as Black 
Monster and Etude House, are 
pressured by laws to test their 
finished products on animals. 
The purpose of such laws is to 
protect people from potentially 
harmful products, yet somehow 
animal testing was not enough 
to stop these products from 
ending up on the list more than 
their cruelty-free counterparts.
Animal testing involves 
taking live animals and put-
ting them under harsh circum-
stances. For testing the effi-
cacy of a new drug, animals, 
many of which are genetically 
modified, may be deliberately 
placed under distressful situ-
ations or otherwise harmed 
in hopes that the researchers 
can learn something about the 
drug. In the realm of soaps and 
detergents, animals’ fur will be 
ripped off and the bare skin will 
be exposed to potentially harsh 
chemicals. The list of ways ani-
mals are tested on goes on, but 
nearly all of them end with 
the researcher euthanizing the 
tested animals.
In 2016, India’s govern-
ment banned animal testing 
for Indian companies that pro-
duce soap, cosmetics, and de-
tergents. However, there have 
been no adverse effects on 
the people in this regard. Fur-
thermore, the European Union 
banned animal testing in 2013. 
This includes a testing band 
and a marketing ban, which 
prohibits the testing or selling 
of animal-tested finished prod-
ucts and their respective in-
gredients. Again, we fail to see 
a rise in recalls or any sign of 
concern pertaining to safety.
Animal testing isn’t even the 
cost-friendly way to go when 
it comes to testing the safety 
of products. As of 2013, it was 
estimated that the U.S. spends 
anywhere between $12 billion 
to $14.5 billion on animal test-
ing. While safety should come 
before monetary cost, it is im-
portant to remember that the 
accuracy of animal testing may 
not be the best. In vitro test-
ing is up to twelve times more 
cost efficient in comparison 
to animal testing and does not 
involve an invasive procedure 
that infringes on a sentient be-
ing’s life.
Alternatively, testing using 
paid human clients is another 
alternative. At first, testing on 
humans may seem to be less 
ethical than testing on an ani-
mal, but this level of height-
ened caution that researchers 
feel about testing on humans 
may provide heightened in-
centive to be more cau-
tious about testing. 
On the participants’ 
end, participants 
must give consent to 
be a part of the procedure and 
may withdraw at any point they 
choose, a freedom that animal 
subjects do not have. Addition-
ally, humans can hold the re-
searchers accountable. Should 
any ethical guideline be bro-
ken, they can take the research-
ers to court; such justice is 
much harder to do for animals.
What we learn from such 
studies is nothing to scoff at. 
Participant-based studies have 
allowed cosmetic brands to test 
out new products that consum-
ers can enjoy. Case studies in-
volving human participants al-
low us to learn more about the 
efficacies of new medicines and 
treatments. The world of pos-
sibilities exceeds what we can 
imagine, but we are confined by 
the mentality that animal test-
ing is the best testing method.
With all these cons, why 
do we 
continue 
to test on 
animals? 
Many 
brands and 
companies 
are able to skip 
the animal cru-
elty at a hefty price: 
cutting main-
land China’s 
population 
out of their 
consumer population. 
Currently, China (ex-
cluding Hong Kong) is 
the only nation that man-
dates animal testing. Part 
of the reason lies in their 
attempt to combat coun-
terfeit products that may 
be circulating the market. 
Many of these counterfeit 
products are not held to 
the same safety standard that 
reputable brands must undergo, 
thus being potentially hazard-
ous to consumers.
However, as mentioned pre-
viously, animal testing is not 
the most efficient or ethical 
method of ensuring product 
safety. Instead of requiring 
reputable brands to test on ani-
mals, perhaps a good step to-
wards countering the damage 
of counterfeit products is 
to have tighter copy-
right laws that protect brands.
China is projected to be the 
largest cosmetics market. Deny-
ing a market that is currently 
$29 billion is a significant loss 
that cruelty-free brands must 
accept in order to avoid test-
ing on animals. However, there 
is room for hope. In 2014, The 
Chinese Food and Drug Admin-
istration claimed it would begin 
to be more open to alternative 
testing methods and waived 
animal testing for some non-
special-use cosmetics, such as 
nail care and perfumes. 
In Sept. 2016, Chi-
na’s Zhejiang In-
stitute for Food 
and Drug Con-
trol opened a lab 
in collaboration 
with the Institute 
for In Vitro Scienc-
es, a U.S. non-profit. 
Together, Chinese scientists 
have been trained to test using 
reconstructed skin cells. If this 
progress continues and China 
lifts its animal testing policy, 
companies will greatly lose any 
incentive to test on animals.
Scienti?c discoveries allow us 
to ?nd new solutions to problems 
and improve the future. Animal 
testing may have, at one point, 
been the most ethical way to en-
sure the public’s safety. However, 
that is not the case anymore. Just 
as our technology is evolving, 
so should our methods of 
testing.

Promising male birth control pill passes safety test
EMMA FLICKINGER
SciTech Editor
A daily pill has been 
shown to safely suppress 
men’s reproductive hor-
mones, making it a strong 
candidate for a male birth 
control pill.
The pill, called dimeth-
androlone undecanoate, or 
DMAU, works by regulating 
the body’s hormone levels 
in order to trick it into think-
ing it’s already producing 
enough reproductive hor-
mones. One way to do this is 
to provide the body with tes-
tosterone, which suppresses 
the production of lutein-
izing hormone and follicle-
stimulating hormones, the 
hormones responsible for 
creating sperm. However, 
too much extra testosterone 
can damage the liver. DMAU 
is designed to suppress 
sperm production while 
keeping the liver safe.
At an endocrinology 
conference this week, re-
searchers presented a study 
that appears to prove DMAU 
as safe for regular use. Of 
the 83 participants, none 
experienced dangerous or 
health-threatening side ef-
fects and only a few expe-
rienced milder side effects 
(like acne). “DMAU shows 
great promise,” said Monica 
Laronda, a reproductive en-
docrinologist at the Ann & 
Robert H. Lurie Children’s 
Hospital of Chicago, to on-
line news outlet Science 
News.
Reliable hormonal 
contraception for women 
has been available for half 
a century, and its develop-
ment is often celebrated as 
a milestone for women’s 
agency over their bodies. 
However, it also set a cultur-
al precedent that placed the 
burden of providing reliable 
contraception mainly on 
women. Why is no equiva-
lent available for men?
“Scientists have been 
working on a male contra-
ceptive for decades,” said 
Laronda. However, trials for 
male birth control methods 
are often halted due to ad-
verse side effects. A 2016 
trial of a birth control in-
jection for men was ended 
early because participants 
reported side effects like 
“muscle pain, increased li-
bido, and acne,” as well as 
possible links to depression, 
according to CNN.
These symptoms will 
be familiar to many 
women who use hormonal 
contraception, as they are 
some of the most common 
side effects of the female 
birth control pill, along with 
many others, including mi-
graines and nausea. One 
study published in 2016, 
with more than one million 
women over 18 years, found 
that up to 15 percent of 
women on hormonal birth 
control needed to be pre-
scribed antidepressants.
While undeniably a 
manifestation of inequality, 
the different ways that clini-
cal trials handle side effects 
for male and female hor-
monal birth control is also 
tied to the time frame of the 
pills’ development. 
“The female contracep-
tive pill was associated with 
signi?cant side effects dur-
ing its ?rst few years of use, 
including some fatalities. 
The [Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA)] of 1960 
is not the FDA of today,” 
said John Amory, associate 
professor of medicine at the 
University of Washington 
Medical Center in Seattle.
The frequent failure 
of clinical trials has made 
male contraceptives a tough 
sell to the pharmaceuti-
cal industry. “To some ex-
tent, why we haven’t seen 
involvement with pharma 
companies is that they’ve 
been disappointed in the 
past with failed products,” 
said Aaron Hamlin, execu-
tive director of advocacy 
group Male Contraception 
Initiative.
Most scientists and 
researchers, however, still 
vehemently support re-
search into a viable hor-
monal birth control for men, 
and studies have shown that 
men want long-term reli-
able contraceptive options 
other than just a vasectomy.
Now that DMAU has been 
proven a safe candidate, the 
researchers will run a three-
month study to measure the 
sperm counts of men on the 
pill. After that, the next step 
is a clinical trial for its effec-
tiveness as a contraceptive.
Many are hopeful that 
DMAU will ?nally bring 
men’s hormonal contracep-
tion up to par with the op-
tions that have been avail-
able to women for decades. 
“It’s hard to solve a 
problem when you es-
sentially exclude half the 
world’s population from 
doing anything about it,” 
said endocrinologist Arthi 
Thirumalai, a co-author of 
the safety study.
Tumblr deletes accounts run by Russian chaos agents
FATIMA AHMAD
Junior Staffwriter
On March 23, social me-
dia site Tumblr con?rmed 
that it had linked at least 
84 accounts on the website 
to 13 agents of the Internet 
Research Agency (IRA), a 
Russian propaganda out?t 
that sought to sow politi-
cal discord on social media 
prior to the 2016 election.
Tumblr deactivated 
the identi?ed IRA blogs 
and emailed a list of their 
handles to any users who 
had either followed the ac-
counts themselves or inter-
acted with the content that 
they posted. 
However, Tumblr did not 
delete the posts from IRA 
blogs that users had “re-
blogged” (shared to their 
own blog). 
In an email with the 
subject line “Update on 
Russian-linked activity on 
Tumblr,” the site informed 
its users of the actions it had 
taken, and what it meant for 
users who had interacted 
with posts from the IRA-run 
accounts, as well as Tum-
blr’s stance on the issue. 
“You aren’t in trouble, 
and you don’t need to take 
any action if you don’t want 
to,” the email read. “We 
deleted the accounts but 
decided to leave up any re-
blog chains so that you can 
curate your own Tumblr to 
re?ect your own personal 
views and perspectives.
“Democracy requires 
transparency and an in-
formed electorate and we 
take our disclosure respon-
sibility very seriously. We’ll 
be aggressively watching 
for disinformation cam-
paigns in the future, take 
the appropriate action, and 
make sure you know about 
it.” 
In a piece for The New 
Yorker, Adrian Chen, who 
wrote one of the earliest and 
most detailed articles on 
the IRA back in 2015 for The 
New York Times, described 
many of the IRA efforts to 
in?uence the election on 
Facebook and Twitter as 
disproportionately conser-
vative and anti-Clinton.
As it stands, many news 
outlets have noted that the 
troll blogs on Tumblr had a 
left-leaning political bend 
and some posted innocu-
ous content, usually ripped 
from Twitter, about social 
issues. 
Back in early February, 
Jonathan Albright, research 
director of the Tow Cen-
ter for Digital Journalism 
stated that the effort on 
Tumblr was one of the larg-
est to speci?cally target left-
leaning, African-American 
youth.
Many IRA blogs were 
staggeringly popular among 
Tumblr users. According 
to New York magazine, 
one such account, under 
the username nevaehtyler, 
re-posted a two-minute 
documentary about street 
harassment from a Twitter 
account, and it amassed 
over 600,000 notes (or re-
blogs and likes, total). An-
other, with the username 
lagonegirl, posted a joke 
about having anxiety dis-
order that garnered over 
300,000 notes.
The content on these 
blogs often combined such 
widely appealing posts with 
ones that played on emo-
tions in order to manipu-
late feelings about certain 
presidential candidates. 
For example, lagonegirl 
also made a post slamming 
Hillary Clinton’s apparent 
position against free college 
for all Americans, while fail-
ing to mention the fact that 
the candidate did believe 
that college should be free 
for any American who could 
otherwise not afford tuition 
without taking out loans.
The blogs also worked 
together to boost each oth-
ers’ content. One of the 
most popular IRA accounts, 
4mysquad, reblogged a 
post from lagonegirl about 
an apparent sex traf?cking 
scheme that gained over 
300,000 notes.
In a more recent New 
Yorker piece, Chen stated 
that he believes that the in-
?uence of these efforts are 
overstated by the media. Af-
ter receiving an email from 
Tumblr, Ryan Broderick, 
Buzzfeed’s Deputy Global 
News Director, stated that 
he believes that the reach of 
Russian trolls on Tumblr is 
probably limited. 
At the time of posting, 
Albright has not measured 
how many Tumblr users 
were exposed to IRA posts, 
but he estimates that about 
150 million Americans have 
been exposed to Russian 
propaganda on Facebook.
The in?uence of Russian 
propaganda on the elec-
tion results themselves is 
indeterminable, because 
we can’t accurately mea-
sure how many individu-
als who shared the con-
tent would have voted 
for Clinton otherwise. How-
ever, because Tumblr chose 
to leave ?agged IRA posts 
on its users’ blogs, the pub-
lic now has an opportunity 
to analyze and re?ect on 
how the IRA’s attempts to 
spread in?uence on social 
media worked.

Disappearing frog populations may be recovering
Frog species that have 
been disappearing due to an 
aggressive skin fungus may 
be starting to come back.
In recent years, the 
fungus Batrachochytrium 
dendrobatidis, or Bd, has 
been killing large numbers 
of frogs around the world. 
Species like variable har-
lequin frogs from Panama 
disappeared entirely, leav-
ing many scientists fearful 
of mass extinctions. But, 
researchers from the Univer-
sity of Nevada, Reno have 
started seeing certain frogs 
returning to their habitats.
Researchers aren’t sure 
what’s causing the rebound. 
Some think a type of skin 
secretion that contains 
pathogen-killing molecules 
is keeping the frogs healthy. 
In a lab setting, the secretion 
has slowed the growth of Bd. 
Others aren’t convinced 
that frogs could evolve 
quickly enough to save 
themselves like this. They 
think that new habitats and 
warming global tempera-
tures may be temporarily 
holding the fungus at bay, 
as Bd can only grow at cool 
temperatures, and in cases 
where frogs move to lower 
altitudes, or are located in 
regions where temperatures 
have gone up, frogs could be 
bene?ting from the limita-
tions of the fungus.
Either way, this isn’t a 
miracle solution to the prob-
lem — many species are still 
declining or at risk. But it is 
a glimmer of hope that we 
haven’t seen the last of these 
amphibians.

Frozen umbilical cord blood may be useful later
The umbilical cord keeps 
a baby alive in the womb, 
sending nutrients and oxy-
gen from the mother to her 
child. But many are excited 
about the health bene?ts the 
umbilical cord can have later 
in life — which has led to the 
phenomenon of banking the 
umbilical cord, or harvest-
ing blood from it and the 
placenta and freezing it for 
later use.
Fetal blood contains 
many cells and molecules 
that aren’t really found any-
where else in the body (at 
least not abundantly). Most 
importantly, it contains stem 
cells, which have the poten-
tial to become several dif-
ferent kinds of blood cells 
depending on where they 
are needed. Umbilical cord 
blood cells could be used to 
cure rare anemia, to repopu-
late blood after treatment 
for leukemia. The effects 
may be similar to a bone 
marrow transplant, but the 
process of harvesting is far 
less invasive. Stem cells from 
umbilical cord blood also 
don’t have to be matched as 
closely between donor and 
recipient. 
Because of these bene?ts, 
doctors of new moms are of-
fering them the opportunity 
to save this blood, and all of 
its therapeutic capabilities. 
Though some of the possibil-
ities may not live up to their 
potential down the road, 
this is certainly an option 
many parents aren’t ruling 
out by throwing away the 
umbilical cord and placenta, 
and the blood they contain.

Are coffee beans carcinogenic? California says yes
A court in California has 
ruled that retailers must label 
coffee with a warning to con-
sumers that coffee contains a 
carcinogen. The judge’s ruling 
came after an eight-year legal 
battle over whether drinking 
coffee is good for your health - 
or whether it could raise your 
chances of getting cancer.
Roasting coffee beans 
creates the compound acryl-
amide as a byproduct. This 
compound is found in many 
carbohydrates after cooking, 
as well as in cigarette smoke 
and some kinds of adhesives. 
In one study, rats and mice that 
were fed acrylamide showed 
an increased cancer risk. 
However, the rats in the study 
were dosed with between 
1,000 and 10,000 times the 
acrylamide than the amount 
people are exposed to in food. 
There haven’t been any stud-
ies that show strong evidence 
that acrylamide is carcino-
genic to humans. While some 
research has linked the com-
pound to kidney, endometrial, 
and ovarian cancer, the results 
have been mixed, according to 
the American Cancer Society, 
and the study data may not be 
accurate.
“Most experts are going to 
look at the risk of acrylamide 
in coffee and conclude that 
this is not something that’s 
going to have a meaningful 
impact on human health,” 
says Len Lichtenfeld, deputy 
chief medical of?cer for the 
American Cancer Society.

A unique light forma-
tion in the aurora borealis, 
discovered last year and 
named "STEVE," is begin-
ning to be understood by 
scientists as it is studied 
more.
STEVE is a violet-mauve 
arc of light with touches of 
green. While auroras usu-
ally resemble large folds of 
light that move horizontal-
ly across the sky, STEVE is a 
vertical streak that appears 
at much lower latitudes 
than the northern lights 
usually do.
STEVE works differ-
ently from the auroras that 
we usually picture when 
we think of the Northern 
Lights. 
These auroras form 
when charged particles 
from the sun accumulate 
at Earth's magnetic poles. 
The charged particles inter-
act with neutral particles in 
Earth's atmosphere to pro-
duce colors.
 Scientists once thought 
streaklike phenomena like 
STEVE were caused by 
proton activity and called 
them "proton arcs," but 
the auroras created by pro-
ton activity are invisible to 
the human eye. They now 
say that STEVE is caused 
by a very hot, fast-?owing 
stream of ions, in a study 
published in March.
The name STEVE is a 
"backronym" — it now 
stands for "Strong Ther-
mal Emission Velocity En-
hancement," a name giv-
en by the scientists that 
studied it, which didn't 
originally stand for any-
thing. STEVE's discoverers, 
citizen scientists in Alberta, 
Canada, were inspired by 
the animated movie Over 
the Hedge, in which forest 
animals discover a hedge 
and decide to call it “Steve,” 
never having seen it before 
or knowing what it is.
Thanks to coordinated 
photography efforts from 
citizen scientists in a Face-
book group called “Alberta 
Aurora Chasers,” as well as 
data from scienti?c instru-
ments, scientists have been 
able to document and study 
this phenomenon with a 
thoroughness not possible 
until very recently.
“In 1997, we had just 
one all-sky imager in North 
America to observe the 
aurora borealis from the 
ground,” said Eric Dono-
van, a researcher at the 
University of Calgary in 
Canada. 
“Back then, we would be 
lucky if we got one photo-
graph a night of the aurora 
taken from the ground that 
coincides with an observa-
tion from a satellite. Now, 
we have many more all-
sky imagers and satellite 
missions like Swarm, so we 
get more than 100 [obser-
vations] a night.”
Phenomena like STEVE 
are neither new nor rare, 
but the ability to investi-
gate them so thoroughly 
from all fronts is only pos-
sible with the information 
age. 
“[The research was pos-
sible] thanks to ground-
based observations, satel-
lites, today's explosion of 
access to data, and an army 
of citizen scientists joining 
forces to document it,” said 
Donovan. “We really are in 
a truly new era.”

a 6-4, 6-2 victory at sixth 
singles before Vizelman 
clinched the match at third 
singles with a 6-1, 6-4 win.
The ?nal victory of the 
day for the Tartans came off 
Strome’s racket, as the ?rst-
year won, 6-3, 7-5, at ?fth 
singles.
The Tartans will next 
travel to the University of 
Mary Washington to face 
the 19th-ranked Eagles on

Men’s Tennis
The ninth-ranked 
Carnegie Mellon University 
men’s tennis team hosted 
29th-ranked Denison 
University on Saturday, 
March 31, defeating the Big 
Red, 7-2, for its 10th win of 
the season.
Senior Tommy Cheng 
and ?rst-year Kailas Shekar 
started the scoring with an 
8-2 win at number three 
doubles. The 15th-ranked 
pair of juniors Daniel Levine 
and Chaz Downing then 
won, 8-6, at ?rst doubles to 
give the Tartans a 2-0 lead.
After Denison won at 
second doubles, Levine and 
Downing made the score 4-1 
with wins at ?rst and second 
singles. Levine, ranked 
second in the nation, won 
his match, 6-2, 6-3, seconds 
before Downing won 6-0, 
6-2 at the second position.
First-year Ray Boppana 
secured the match with a 
6-4, 6-3 win at third singles.
Other wins for the 
Tartans came at fourth and 
?fth singles by Shekar and 
sophomore Robert Levin, 
respectively. Shekar topped 
his opponent, 7-5, 1-6, 6-2, 
while Levin won, 5-7, 6-2, 
6-4.
The Tartans now have 
a 10-5 record and will face 
the University of Mary 
Washington on the road on 
Saturday, April 7.

This year at the NCAA 
Championships, the 
Carnegie Mellon University 
women’s Swimming and 
Diving Team placed 15th 
overall — the highest 
team finish in the school’s 
history. Leading this 
charge was senior Kim 
Hochstedler, who broke a 
school record with a fifth-
place finish in the 200-
yard breaststroke. A com-
petitive swimmer since the 
age of nine, Hochstedler 
collected an All-American 
Honor and an All-Ameri-
can Honorable Mention at 
the meet two weeks ago, 
adding to her two other 
All-American Honorable 
Mentions throughout her 
career.
“I knew I wanted to 
swim in college, and I found 
that I really clicked with 
the team here at Carnegie 
Mellon on my recruiting 
trip,” said Hochstedler 
in an interview with 
The Tartan. “I felt like I 
immediately belonged on 
the team and that is what 
made me decide to commit 
to the program.”
This year’s NCAA 
Championships in 
Indianapolis, IN, held a 
special significance for 
Hochstedler, who was born 
in Indiana.
“This year, the meet 
was held in Indianapolis, 
at a pool I swam at many 
times a year growing up. 
It was really special to end 
my swimming career at a 
pool I spent so much time 
at before college.” 
She was able to shave 
more than a second off of 
her previous career-best 
200-yard breaststroke 
time at this year’s 
championships, breaking a 
record at Carnegie Mellon 
set by herself merely a year 
ago.
As a senior, this was the 
last season for Hochstedler, 
who said, “I am proud that 
I was able to drop time 
and improve in all of my 
events during my college 
swimming career. Our 
conference and national 
competition has gotten 
faster every year, and I 
am proud that I was able 
to make an impact on my 
team’s success at this level 
through my four years.”
The team as a whole 
had a strong showing at the 
NCAA tournament,  with 
first-year Jessica Chau 
debuting at the tournament 
with a 13th place finish in 
the 200-yard backstroke, 
while sophomore Emma 
Nicklas-Morris finished 
13th overall in the 200-
yard individual medley.ß
As the swimming and 
diving team look forward 
to the next season, 
Hochstedler reflects 
back on her time here at 
Carnegie Mellon.
“The camaraderie of 
the team is definitely 
something I will miss after 
college. Being a part of 
the team means that you 
have immediately made 
70 friends among your 
teammates on campus,” 
commented Hochstedler. 
“We hang out together, 
practice together, and live 
together, so my teammates 
have had a large impact 
on my Carnegie Mellon 
experience. It really is a 
great group of people to be 
with, so I will miss getting 
to be a part of the team 
and swimming community 
after graduation.”

MLB baseball is back, playoff contenders are familiar
BRAD PUSKAR
Staffwriter
Spring weather is just 
about to ?nally arrive in 
Pittsburgh, and with it 
comes the fever for baseball 
that fans across the country 
miss dearly in the winter. 
After the Houston Astros’ 
impressive World Series win 
in 2017, and with the 2018 
season well under way, what 
can fans expect to happen in 
MLB baseball this year?
American League (AL)
East: All likelihood goes 
to the New York Yankees in 
the race for the AL East this 
season. By adding last year’s 
home run leader in Giancarlo 
Stanton to a powerful lineup 
that already holds Aaron 
Judge and Gary Sanchez, 
this team has the power to 
out-slug and outscore just 
about any team in the entire 
MLB. Their pitching staff is 
nothing to shake at, either. 
Luis Severino ?nished in 
third place in Cy Young 
voting last season, and 
the return of Sonny Gray 
will help to stabilize their 
starting rotation. Look for 
the Yankees to score 200 
runs.
The Boston Red Sox 
should be the ?rst AL wild 
card, too, with the way 
they’re looking.
Central: Obviously, 
anybody would pick the 
Cleveland Indians. They’re 
still rolling from their two 
consecutive postseason 
appearances, Corey Kluber 
and Carlos Carrasco are a 
vicious one-two punch in the 
starting pitching rotation, 
and, if Fransisco Lindow can 
carry over his success from 
last season, this team will be 
tough to beat.
Don’t count out the 
Minnesota Twins as a 
possible wild card, however.
West: The Astros. Come 
on. They won the World 
Series last year and aren’t 
showing any signs of slowing 
down. After acquiring Gerrit 
Cole from Pittsburgh, the 
Astros might have the most 
consistency in a ?ve-man 
pitching rotation of anyone 
in the league. Don’t worry 
about the Astros making the 
postseason.
National League (NL)
East: The clear front 
runner in the NL East is, 
possibly for the last year, 
the Washington Nationals. 
They’ve got two of the best 
pitchers in the entire league 
in Max Scherzer, coming 
off his third Cy Young 
Award season, and Stephen 
Strasburg. Bryce Harper, 
Anthony Rendon, Adam 
Eaton, and Trea Turner 
all make up an incredibly 
strong starting lineup that 
can hit with the best of 
teams. Scherzer and Daniel 
Murphy are getting older, 
and Harper is a free agent 
next year, so the Nats better 
strike while the iron is hot 
and try to get that ?rst World 
Series win now.
Watch out for the 
Philadelphia Phillies in a 
wildcard spot, now that 
Jake Arrieta has signed 
with them. They’re a young 
corps with a lot of room to 
sail to easy victories against 
the New York Mets, Atlanta 
Braves, and Miami Marlins.
Central: My heart 
screams Pittsburgh Pirates 
because of the extreme 
home town bias, but I have 
to hand this year’s Central 
victory to the Chicago Cubs 
again. They’re only getting 
better in adding pitcher 
Yu Darvish from the Los 
Angeles Dodgers in the off 
season, and Jose Quintana, 
Jon Lester, Kyle Hendricks, 
and Tyler Chatwood all can 
clean up after him. The Cubs 
don’t lack in power, either, 
with Anthony Rizzo and Kris 
Bryant forming a fearsome 
1-2 starting lineup.
Any team in this division 
other than the Cincinnati 
Reds could take the wild 
card or even challenge for 
the division. The St. Louis 
Cardinals have been quiet, 
which usually means they’re 
stirring up some witchcraft 
to win another World Series. 
The Pirates are the Pirates 
and might stumble into a 
wildcard spot without the 
help of Andrew McCutchen 
and Gerrit Cole if their 
pitchers can eat innings and 
Gregory Polanco has as mas-
sive a year as everyone is 
hoping, and the Milwaukee 
Brewers have no shortage of 
power on their end, either. 
It’s anybody’s game in the 
NL Central once again, in 
my eyes.
West: Anyone who 
doesn’t say the Los Angeles 
Dodgers aren’t winning the 
division this year isn’t as 
crazy as they sound. Much 
like the Central, four of the 
?ve teams in this division 
have a solid chance of 
making the playoffs, be it a 
division win or a Wild Card 
grab.
The Dodgers are the 
Dodgers. They have all the 
money in the world and the 
talent to back it up. Just to 
name a few: reigning NL 
rookie of the year Cody 
Bellinger, Corey Seager, 
Chris Taylor, Justin Turner, 
and Clayton Kershaw. The 
Dodgers have the chance 
to run away with this 
division, while the San 
Francisco Giants are a team 
that can hit. After bringing 
in McCutchen and Evan 
Longoria, this team has the 
potential to be one of the 
most potent offenses in the 
MLB. Watch out for them 
in the wild card round, and, 
since it’s an even numbered 
year, the World Series. It’s 
baseball time!

On visiting friends at other colleges
Dear Izzy,
I’m heading out to visit my friend at another 
college, and I’m really excited but really terrified. 
She goes to a university that’s a lot farther and a 
lot different from here, where the campus is a lot 
bigger and the culture is really different. Basically, 
it’ll be a completely new environment and she’s 
taking me to all these parties and places, and I 
won’t know anyone there but her.
I wanna get the chance to meet new people and 
talk to all her cool friends, but I’m struggling with 
how to adapt to this new place quickly and how to 
open up to people in order to form a connection 
in a short amount of time. And, she’s been like 
hyping me up to all her friends back home, and 
I’m worried they’re gonna expect this super cool 
Pittsburgh gal with a bunch of weird stories and 
they’ll end up with just an average Pittsburgh gal 
who is really just an introvert that got adopted by 
a wacky extroverted friend. Any advice?
From,
Nervous (Extremely) Worried Gonna Act Lame 
Dear NEW GAL,
In terms of the new environment, the internet 
is your best friend. Research more about her 
college and her city online, and maybe learn 
a little bit more about the area. It’s also totally 
fine to go into this new city completely blind; 
sometimes the most fun can come from discovering 
things spontaneously, or the unexpected joy and 
accomplishment of learning that “Yes, I CAN read 
a map correctly and not get completely lost.” 
Having a healthy balance of both sides I think will 
make you the most comfortable.
In my opinion, you’ve already won half the battle; 
you’ve already established that you genuinely 
want to go out and meet new people. Enthusiasm 
takes you a long way, and people will see that 
charm, excitement, and happiness in you and 
it’ll radiate off into everyone you meet. And who 
knows, their positive energy might just radiate 
back on you, and before you know it...you’ve got 
a conversation going! Achievement Unlocked! 
Often what gets in the way of taking that leap 
into a new, unexpected territory are nerves, but 
it’s truly our excited anticipation that helps us to 
overcome them.
Most importantly, don’t forget to be yourself. 
That’s what your friends’ friends are going to 
be most excited for. If she actually is hyping you 
up, there must be a reason why: maybe she sees 
some of you in her friends at college, and wants 
you to get to know more people who are just 
as wonderful as you! That’s a sign that she truly 
cares for you as a friend. Just relax and have fun. 
Everything will turn out just fine!
Good luck out there!

 Aisha Han | Contributing EditorBar Buddies: Apteka
This week, my gals and I decided to mingle with 
some yuppies in a small Lawrenceville nook called 
Apteka. The place has garnered quite a good 
reputation for its 1) unique menu (Polish vegan), 
and 2) amazing cocktails. I had never been 
there before, so I decided to book a large party 
there for a friend’s birthday dinner. Apteka was 
definitely the highlight of my week, but there were 
both pros and cons. Let’s start with the pros.
The vibe: Apteka is a very young, hoppy place 
with a great mood. A majority of the patrons 
were young professionals, and the space was 
open and playful. The lighting is dim and warm, 
perfect for a dinner-then-drinks agenda. It’s 
definitely a more upscale, millennial drinking 
scene, and the prices on the menu prove just that.
The food: Polish vegan food never tasted better. 
Apteka had a sprawling menu with authentic-
sounding dishes, from your classic pierogi to 
the homely borscht. I ordered the Baba Jaga 
sandwich with a side of pierogies, and I’m pretty 
sure those were the tastiest vegan dishes I’ve 
had in Pittsburgh. There was plenty of flavor and 
texture in the sandwich, and the pierogies did not 
lose their familiar hearty, creamy taste despite 
being dairy-free.
The drinks were amazing as well. There’s a 
certain quality to the juices and flavors added 
that don’t make the cocktails cloyingly sweet, 
or hard to sip on. Every single one I tried was 
refreshing, and they had a great selection of 
wines.
The location: Here’s where the restaurant falls a 
little flat. Apteka is a little out of the way from 
usual Carnegie Mellon routes; It sits right near 
Bloomfield down the street from the UPMC 
Children’s Hospital. To get that far down Penn 
Ave. with a bus, you’d need to somehow get on 
the 88. Ubering there would probably be the best 
bet. Additionally, Apteka isn’t a convenient stop 
from other popular student bar scenes, as central 
Lawrenceville and the lit part of East Liberty are 
equidistant 20-minute walks away.
Lit or nah: There were some hiccups during our 
experience there. Luckily, my party made it to 
the restaurant earlier than our reservation time, 
because the system is set up for you to wait in line 
and order before you sit down. So in addition to 
my wait to order, I had to get to the front of the 
line to flag down a waitress and check in on my 
reservation. Once you’re seated, they bring the 
food over, but to get a second batch of drinks, 
you’ll have to go back up to the front and order 
at the bar. It’s a strange system, and the way 
the room was set up involved getting in other 
people’s way because of the small space. That 
alone affected my lit-ness, but good company 
fixes everything. I enjoyed the atmosphere, and 
the staff were accommodating. The other groups 
in the restaurant seemed like they were having fun 
too, so it’s overall a really good time.
For Polish vegan food and good times

J
ack White is definitely not a normal 
person. His weirdness has been clear 
ever since his days as frontman for The 
White Stripes in the early 2000s, when 
he and his drummer ex-wife Meg White 
would dress in outlandish red, white, 
and black outfits and bill themselves as 
a brother-sister duo. But, White’s latest 
record Boarding House Reach — his 
third solo effort since The White Stripes 
parted ways in the late 2000s — takes 
the strangeness to a whole new level, 
producing an over-the-top, self-indulgent 
project that, despite a few bright spots, is 
difficult to listen to.
While White’s work with The White 
Stripes had a raw garage rock sound 
and revolved mainly around scrappy 
guitar playing and unrefined drums, he 
has branched out in his solo career. His 
first two solo albums, Blunderbuss and 
Lazaretto, introduced the heavy use of 
piano and violins and an overall more 
polished, produced sound. Despite being 
more cleanly recorded, White retained 
the bristling energy from his White Stripes 
Jack White’s 
Boarding House 
Reach

days, as well as continuing to write wacky 
yet interesting lyrics. White also began to 
experiment more, such as with “High Ball 
Stepper,” a raucous instrumental track 
featuring a shrieking guitar solo.
In Boarding House Reach, White opts for a 
more electronic sound. While he has long 
been a believer in old-school recording 
techniques — Blunderbuss was recorded 
on analogue tape, and he prefers to mix 
without using automation — his new 
project represents his first foray into Pro 
Tools, a digital sound recording and 
production system. The more modern, 
electronic sound is evident immediately, 
the first track, “Connected By Love,” 
beginning with an oscillating effect that 
sounds like a lightsaber being waved 
back and forth. While the song later adds 
piano and drums, the effect continues 
underneath throughout. The melody and 
vocal style are reminiscent of Blunderbuss, 
while a solo that combines guitar and 
keyboard echoes the sound of Lazaretto. 
While hints of his previous work remain, 
the final notes return to a higher-pitched 
4

---------------------------------------------------

wavering noise that reminds listeners of 
White’s new direction.
However, White’s first experience with Pro 
Tools is like a kid in a candy store. White 
throws in random sounds with reckless 
abandon and many of his songs are 
devoid of structure, just following 
whatever musical path popped 
into White’s mind next. For example, 
the funky “Corporation,” which actually 
opens with a solid riff, jumps so often 
between sounds that it feels all over the 
place. “Ice Station Zebra” starts with a 
muddy drum beat, then shifts to a hushed 
piano and a funky rhythm. It also features 
White attempting to rap (or do spoken 
word) — something we’ve seen before on 
“Rag and Bone” from The White Stripes’ 
Icky Thump — but while the Stripes 
song features a stomping beat, and a 
hard, energetic guitar melody set up by 
a playful riff, the music in “Ice Station 
Zebra” is discombobulated and overdone.
Other times, White just 
goes too far with the 
electronic sound effects. 
On “Hypermiso-
phoniac,” the title 
of which is derived 
from a condition 
where negative 
emotions and 
reactions 
are set off 
by specific 
sounds, White 
attempts to create 
something beautiful 
out of irritating sounds, 
such as his son’s toys. However, 
the end result is a jarring jumble of 
clashing sounds.
Some tracks even deviate from being 
true “songs.” “Abulia and Akrasia” 
features a poem being read over 
pianos and violin, “Everything You’ve 
Ever Learned” is built around muted 
drums and White shouting angrily, and 
“Ezmerelda Steals the Show” has White 
reciting a magical-sounding story over 
repetitive guitar picking. While perhaps 
intriguing for one listen, these tracks just 
“Perhaps 
it is better 
viewed as a 
boundary-
breaking 
piece of 
art, not 
necessarily 
meant to 
be enjoyed 
but rather 
studied and 
analyzed.”
make the 
album into 
an even more 
confounding 
and disjointed 
project.
There are a 
few bright 
spots, such as 
“Connected 
By Love.” 
Others 
include “Over 
and Over and 
Over,” which 
features a 
boisterous, bouncy guitar riff and smart 
but odd lyrics that would feel at home 
on Lazaretto. “Respect Commander,” 
although a bit messy, is bolstered by 
moody, raw blues guitar, and the country 
tune “What’s Done is Done” thrives 
due to its simplicity. The final track, 
“Humoresque,” is a calming close to the 
album, despite its unorthodox origins; 
White based it around lyrics written by 
1920s gangster Al Capone while in prison 
and music from a 19th-century tune by 
Czech composer Antonín Dvorák.
Overall, however, Boarding House Reach 
is too unfocused and bizarre to work as 
a cohesive and enjoyable piece of music. 
Perhaps, it is better viewed as a boundary-
breaking piece of art, not necessarily 
meant to be enjoyed but rather studied 
and analyzed. However, after the two 
excellent solo albums, Blunderbuss and 
Lazaretto, Boarding House Reach feels like 
a let down, and a downright mess.

wonder
Nelson Mandela, former South African president and renowned anti-apartheid protestor, once said “It always seems 
impossible until it’s done.” Carrying a similar message to Mandela’s quote, Wonder, directed by Stephen Chbosky, 
is an inspirational tale of bravery, independence, confidence, and daring to dream big. The film is about August 
Pullman, a young boy born with genetic differences causing his face to contrast with those of his peers. The story is 
inspirational and incredible in its nature and based on a novel written by R.J. Palacio with the same name.
As August, or Auggie, is starting fifth grade and attending school for the first time, it seems like he has an impossible task 
ahead of him: making friends, doing well in school, and attempting to grasp how judgmental people can really be. One of 
the morals of the film is to embrace who you are and to not let people judge you from the outside, emphasizing what’s 
on the inside. It sounds like a cheesy motto to live by, but if everyone took time to establish who they want to be as a 
person, rather than thinking about how others will perceive them, we would be better off. Easier said than done, learn-
ing who you are as a person is valuable.
Friendship is another theme of the film. Auggie experiences the harsh reality that, sometimes, the people you thought 
were your closest friends can turn into those who judge and look down on you. However, something I thought was par-
ticularly powerful was how Auggie composed himself after hearing firsthand the negative words said by his so-called 
“best friend” Jack. He was able to accept that Jack had made a mistake and that moving forward in their friendship 
would be the best option. This is an incredible idea to witness as an audience member. The fact that a young boy is 
able to be forgiving to this extent is so empowering to those watching. It displays that, even when you feel that the 
friendship will never be the same, forgiveness is important. Even though it is only a film, it is quite fascinating that a 
boy of Auggie’s age is able to comprehend such an important life lesson already.
Finally, family is another important theme. Having a place to belong and people who love and support you is critical. 
Also, surrounding yourself with the right people who have your best interests at heart is special. Auggie’s family dem-
onstrates that the people that love and take care of Auggie are the most influential in his success.
Overall, I felt that this film was very well constructed. It was nice to be exposed to something outside the “normal” film 
boundaries. I highly recommend it for all ages, but especially to younger children, for I feel there is a lot to learn from it. 
Although it has taken a while, the film industry is progressing slowly into an age of cinema in which the emphasis of films does not have to be 
on a white man, with a female love interest. Though audiences have stayed the same, themes are impactful: main characters are not restricted 
by gender, and films are beginning to place emphasis on important issues and topics applicable to current events. Indeed, Auggie Pullman is 
an inspirational boy with a wonderful story that everyone should experience.

I’ve been doing my best to seek out more unique eateries in Pittsburgh. And, when I say “unique,” I’m referring to a 
restaurant’s food and atmosphere. I feel like these are the coolest kinds of places to casually meet up with friends and 
hang out. As of right now, one of my favorite unique restaurants to eat at in Pittsburgh is Love Ramen. It’s located on 
Atwood Street in Oakland and, like the name suggests, it serves ramen.
What makes Love Ramen so special, however, is its frozen yogurt backstory. All I know is that Love Ramen used to be 
named Love Yogurt, and its specialty used to be frozen yogurt. I’m not actually sure when the restaurant’s name was 
changed, but inside you’ll still find a frozen yogurt toppings bar. I think they still do sell yogurt, but the majority of 
their customers come for the ramen.
I discovered this place last summer when one of my friends brought me for lunch. My initial thoughts of the restaurant 
were “how unusual” and “that’s interesting, a yogurt place that’s known for their ramen.” Once I sat down and finally 
had a bowl of their ramen, I realized then how cool and unique it was to be eating there. First of all, the ramen 
is pretty good. There are various options for broths, noodles, proteins, and toppings from which you choose and 
check off from their laminated menus. The portions are quite filling, so be sure to arrive on an empty stomach. The 
presentation of the food is also very cute, where you receive your steaming ramen in a large black bowl on a bright 
red tray, with a large spoon and chopsticks.
My favorite aspect of Love Ramen, however, is its fun atmosphere. The walls are painted very bright and whimsical 
colors like lime green, orange, and pink. Under all the tables, you’ll find a variety of board games from your 
childhood that you can play with your friends. And at different sections in the store, you’ll see the remnants of their 
original “just frozen yogurt” business, which is cool and a bit random. Being in the restaurant definitely makes me 
feel like a young kid again, and it’s now a favorite spot for me and my friends mainly because of its fun and relaxed 
setting. Another great thing is that it’s never too crowded when we go and the service is pretty quick. If you’re looking 
for a nice place to eat with a low-key atmosphere and good ramen, be sure to check out Love Ramen.

If you visited The Underground last Thursday 
at around 8 p.m., then you would’ve heard the 
sweet voices of Carnegie Mellon’s award-win-
ning co-ed a capella group, the Treblemakers. 
The group, known for their upbeat energy and 
energetic covers, hosted their very first mem-
bers-focused cabaret, featuring music from var-
ious genres and an original song from music 
director Andrew Abrahamson, a senior music 
composition major. Abrahamson and tenor 
Connor Maggio, a junior mechanical engineer-
ing major, played accompaniment and guitar 
respectively, for several of the individual acts. 
Even though the cabaret was delayed (turns 
out rain and electronic mics do not mix well!), 
the Treblemakers did not disappoint. They 
showed off their individual skills, proving 
that they are each as talented as the group 
altogether.
The show opened with sophomore vocal 
performance major and assistant music 
director Krishna Raman and junior 
mechanical engineering and engineering 
and public policy major Elizabeth Elrod 
performing a cover of “You Don’t Do It for Me 
Anymore” by Demi Lovato. The duo’s voices 
blended wonderfully together, adding power 
and emotion to the song. Raman’s smooth riffs 
and Elrod’s strong head voice combined to 
create tenderness within the song, showing the 
audience their collectively wide vocal range.
Next up, with the entirety of the Treblemakers 
in attendance, was their high-spirited ren-
dition of Duffy’s “Mercy.” President Julia 
Napolitano, a senior chemical and biomedical 
engineering major, shone as the song’s solo-
ist, proving her chops as a talented soprano. 
The group was clearly having fun, a mood 
that transferred to the audience as they jived 
and danced with each other onstage. 
Complete with impressive beatboxing 
and a surprising rap, this cover showcased the 
Treblemakers’ abilities as performers.
First-year business 
major Amy Liu 
performed a 
solo cover of 
Begonia’s 
“Out of My 
Head.” 
Don’t be 
fooled by 
her new 
member 
status; 
Liu’s powerful voice and rich low notes gave 
her an air of professionalism and a tenderness 
to her cover. Performing with a similar sense 
of vocal style was mathematics junior and 
secretary Drew Moses with his cover of Scott 
Hoying’s cover of “At Last” by Etta James. His 
strong vibrato and fluid riffs displayed real 
confidence and style in this song.
The second duo of the evening was sopranos 
Taylor Kay Baer, a first-year vocal perfor-
mance major, and Napolitano, with their rendi-
tion of Halsey’s “Sorry.” Their beautiful voices 
worked really well with each other as they 
switched between low and high harmonies, 
showing off their vocal versatility. It was soft, 
sweet, and filled with emotion.
Performing next was vice president Ambika 
Chetal, a junior chemistry student, belting 
Beyoncé’s “If I Were a Boy.” This ballad-y ver-
sion was softer than the original but still pow-
erful and vulnerable, showing off Chetal’s belt 
and lower notes.
Switching to a more country vibe, sopho-
more business major Lauren Wholey per-
formed “Mary’s Song” by Tayor Swift. Like 
Abrahamson and Maggio, Wholey showed off 
her skill as a multi-talented musician by singing 
and playing acoustic guitar, making her cover 
an awesome tribute to Taylor Swift herself. 
Also playing acoustic guitar was Maggio,

performing “Emoji of a Wave” by John Mayer. 
His skill as a guitarist was apparent, and his soft 
voice fit the aesthetic of the song well.
A shining moment was first-year Baer’s cover of 
Kelly Clarkson’s “Piece by Piece.” Choosing to 
perform a song that was near and dear to her, 
her performance made it clear how this song hits 
home emotionally. Even with Abrahamson on 
piano and Raman providing backup vocals, all 
of the focus was on her and her beautiful voice. 
Her cover was sweet and tender, and incredibly 
impressive.
Maggio then returned for his second perfor-
mance of the night, a short cover of “Untitled” 
by Rex Orange County. Busting out his cream-
colored electric guitar, Maggio sang, whistled, 
and played a wonderful cover. His lilting voice 
paid a strong tribute to the original artist, doing 
the song justice.
Also a strong tribute to the original artist was 
Raman’s powerful cover of Sia’s “Elastic Heart.” 
Not only known for his smooth riffs but also his 
ability to belt pop power ballads, Raman deliv-
ered yet again with this cover of Sia. It was both 
energetic and warm, truly showing off Raman’s 
abilities as a soloist.
To close off the show was an original song
written by Abrahamson. Titled “Hydroplane,” 
the song was gentle and bittersweet, featuring a 
protagonist who is “trying not to lose” his lover 
and is “sick of waking up alone.” It showed off 
Abrahamson’s abilities as both a performer and 
a songwriter, clearly showing the audience that 
he is the right man for the position of music
director.
Accompanied by Maggio on acoustic guitar, the 
two gave a fantastic performance to end their 
first cabaret.
The Treblemakers all gave an impressive
performance at a very successful first cabaret.

performances (past and future), check out

There are two things in my life I have discovered in college that 
have helped me to find solace and a greater sense of knowledge 
after growing up in Greenwich, CT, where I was out of touch with 
my Asian roots: Anna Akana’s YouTube videos and Kevin Kwan’s 
Crazy Rich Asians. Incredibly smart and descriptive, along with 
being hilarious and relatable, Kwan’s Crazy Rich Asians is set to 
become a movie this summer with an all-star cast of various Asian-
American stars. And, after devouring Kwan’s novel on my nine-
hour plane ride back to New York, I personally hope Crazy Rich 
Asians will be to people like me what Black Panther has become 
for African-Americans.
Kwan’s 2013 satirical novel tells the story of Rachel Chu, a New 
York University economics professor who decides to 
go spend her summer with her boyfriend Nick 
Young in Singapore along with attend-
ing the wedding of one of Nick’s best 
friends. However, Nick neglects to 
mention his family’s astounding 
wealth (up in the trillions, most 
likely) and prestigious lineage 
(including being in-laws to 
Thai royalty) to Rachel 
before she leaves. As 
soon as she arrives in 
Singapore, she is swept 
up into a world of the 
exceedingly and extrava-
gantly rich. She must 
navigate Nick’s nosy relatives 
and the judgment of those within 
Nick’s social circle, all while continuously trying to stick her 
ground and maintain her own identity.
Not only does the book fabulously showcase various types of 
Asians — Chinese, Singaporeans, Hong Kongese, and even 
Filipinos — Crazy Rich Asians’ rich narration and language helped 
to perfectly recreate the lavishness, extravagance, and elegance 
that Kwan associates the Asian upper-class life with. When Kwan 
describes Singapore’s food culture and picturesque surroundings, 
it is incredibly easy to picture the food in front of you and marvel 
at the beauty of Nick Young’s home. Kwan immediately immerses 
you into Nick’s affluent lifestyle, making you feel like you are also 
Rachel Chu — an outsider walking into a new mysterious world 
for the first time, where its beauty makes you feel so at home 
Throughout Crazy Rich Asians, Kwan masterfully describes all of his 
surroundings with vivid detail and sharp wit.
However, perhaps his greatest achievement is the dynamic that he 
has established between the characters, and the accuracy at which 
he satirizes the upper-class Asian lifestyle. His humor instantly felt 
relatable and his subtle satire only emphasized that relatability; 
never had I felt so connected to a singular novel because of the 
faith I had in him (that I had found very early in the novel) to tell a 
perspective of a woman stuck in the diaspora, who suddenly real-
ized how out of touch she was with her home conti-
nent, and how desperately singled out and lonely she 
felt. Never had I felt so connected to the gen-
erational divide Kwan establishes between 
the older and younger members of 
Nick’s family. I was amazed at how 
he made every single one of Nick’s 
family members feel like their own 
unique character with their dif-
ferent views, personalities, and 
interests. Never had I smiled so 
much at all the Asian references 
that Kwan makes, the snide side 
remarks that play at Asian social 
lives, and at the journey that Kwan 
took his lead characters on to help 
them discover their own identities apart 
from their families, imbuing me with a great 
sense of pride to be an Asian-American.
The uniquely ridiculous and heartwarming book known as Crazy 
Rich Asians is as colorful, vivid, hilarious, and fantastic as people 
say it is, but it does an amazing job at highlighting much more than 
that. In its own great way, it tells the story of a woman trying to 
grab a hold of her identity in a divided world, and goes extremely 
in-depth into questions about identity, family, and love that make 
Kwan’s novel even more of a treasure. I highly recommend Crazy 
Rich Asians not only to people looking for a hilarious beach read 
to take them out of the tension of academics but also to people 
searching for their own places in the world and for their own racial 
identities.
