Toxic Fumes Hinder Queen Candidates Selected 
WRCT Fire-Proofing For Military Ball; 9 Compete
uby Sue Attinson
WRCT staff members ran 
into difficulty last week when 
they attempted to fire-proof 
the studio’s egg carton walls.
“I was as high as a kite,” recall­
ed the station’s advisory program 
director, Joe Hupcey, as he re­
viewed last Thursday nights fire- 
proofing session. His condition, he 
discovered later, was caused by 
t the toxic fumes of the fire-proof­
ing material.
The material has a perchloro- 
etlielyne base and is similar to 
that solvent used in dry-cleaning 
plants.
When installed, the egg cartons 
had been saturated with Borax 
solution. But this, according to the 
campus safety committee, was not 
sufficiently fire-proof.
. Upon the approval of the safety 
'^committee, the school had ordered 
the fire-proofing material from a 
local chemical company.
Last Thursday evening, ‘ eight 
members of the WRCT staff began 
applying the fire-proofing ma­
terials with paint sprayers. When 
they recognized the unusual af­
fects of the fumes, the staff mem­
bers instituted a modified system 
of application. Workers sprayed 
for one minute intervals and then 
C went otuside into the fresh air. 
Using this system they applied one 
coat of the material.
On Friday, when the admini­
stration recognized the fire-proof­
ing material’s high degree of toxi­
city, it changed the lock on 
WRCT’s studio door and prohibit­
ed any students to enter the facili­
ties.
Security policemen checked the 
studios for student occupants ev- 
(¿kvy half hour.
WRCT staff members set up 
temporary offices in room 46 Ski- 
bo and constructed makeshift 
studios in the basement of Ham-
erschlag House. Because the ad­
ministration prevented the remov­
al of equipment from the WRCT 
studios. They borrowed records 
and played musifc on the air from 
7:30 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday 
evening.
On Sunday, the administration 
re-opened the studio facilities. 
Fans cleared away the chemical 
fumes.
According to George Brown, 
dean of student affairs, the ad­
ministration is consulting with the 
Mine Safety Appliances Company 
about the possible use of masks 
and protective clothing for further 
application of the fire-proofing 
materials.

snack-bar service and facilities. 
He is considering the installation 
of a pizza oven and a self-op­
erating pop-corn machine. Helm 
stated, “These additions will be 
assured if student response seems 
favorable.”
Suggestions and opinions about 
the snack-bar facilities should be

Editorial
Enlightened Housing
The Women’s Dormitory Council has recommended the 
following two proposals on housing policy to the administra­tion:
A. Students who are seniors or over twenty-one be per­
mitted, with parental approval, to live outside of the 
Morewood dormitory.
B. A self-governing, self-contained A tower be developed 
for senior women.
Dedicated to goal of harmony and efficiency, the Wom­
ens’ Dormitory Council has proposed this enlightened housing 
program to translate these* abstractions into concrete actions. 
Because the above points highlight the council’s basic phil­
osophy, it is necessary to explain the intended policy.
Following a survey this year of the entire housing pro­
gram, in which other schools all over the country were also 
evaluated, it was noted that Morewood Gardens had been 
outpaced by some in modernity.
To speed its stride in order to catch up, the council voiced 
its complaints about present policy and suggested construc­
tive plans for improvement. One idea advanced the notion 
that seniors have different needs than other underclassmen, 
and therefore provisions should be made to meet their ex­
pectations.
Point A above tries to accomplish this. Girls who have 
reached their senior year, or are at least twenty-one years of 
age, should certainly be mature enough to manage themselves 
and an apartment if they choose to do so. Most important to 
them is having the knowledge that a choice of whether or not 
to live in the dorm exists, rather than having this limitation 
imposed on them.
Emphasizing the importance of students carrying re­
sponsibility, council has expanded this concept by supporting 
point B.
The rationale behind allowing, senior women to 
establish their own regulations is simple: by her senior 
year, a woman resident no longer needs the guiding re­
strictions imposed on her since her freshman year.
A Senior should be undergoing a transition period, 
where protective restraints are at a minimum, where deci­
sions are her own, and where responsibility is in her hands. 
This is the finest preparation to be given before she leaves 
Carnegie Tech, whether she gets married, works, or con­
tinues her studies in graduate school.
Under the present system the change is too abrupt. She 
is asked to step out from authorized rules and learn to 
make her own decisions, yet she has been pampered and has 
had decisions made for her since her freshman year.
It is hoped this new approach will bridge the senior’s in­
termediary roles as undergraduate and graduate, so that one 
easily flows into the next. The seniors who have the necessary 
parental permission to live in this honor dorm, will carry all 
the responsibility in maintaining their tower.
If instituted, it will be on a trial basis, with emphasis on 
what program the students set up to meet their needs and 
exactly how much responsibility they can take.
The council’s primary aim is to create the finest climate 
for learning. The above two points have been abstracted 
from the five-point program because they are seemingly the 
most revolutionary steps.
But it is hoped that the Administration will accept our 
proposals and agree that where there is privilege, there is 
responsibility, and where responsibility exists, there is 
maturity.

WRCT Sees Administration's 
Treatment As Unfair
Editor, The Tartan:
We at WRCT feel that we have 
been treated with a lack of human 
courtesy by the administration of 
Carnegie Tech. When we decided 
to use the egg crates you havi^ 
seen in the Tartan and Pittsburgh 
Press, we were told that they 
ought to be fire-proofed. And so 
we dipped them in a borax solu­tion.
The school safety committee an­
nounced to us that our fireproof- 
ing was inadequate, even though 
our research showed that our egg 
crates were more fireproof than 
the ceiling tiles in our section of 
Skibo; that the Pittsburgh and*,«. 
National Building Codes definitely 
do not require fireproofing of any 
sort; and that there are many 
places on campus that are far 
greater fire hazards.
We discovered, incidentally, that 
Chief Young had previously called 
some people in city government 
and told them not to talk to us.
We found a laboratory which 
developed a fire-proofing chem­
ical for us and after obtaining 
clearance from the appropriate 
people in the administration, be­
gan to apply the liquid to the 
walls.
Because of the toxic fumes from 
the chemical, we did the job in 
thirty-second shifts, airing out the 
studios as recommended by the laboratory.
When we came back later that 
night to apply a second coat, we 
found a member of the Campus 
Security Police barring our en- * 
trance. He said he had orders to 
prevent us from finishing the job 
and he refused to tell us why or 
let us make any phone calls. We 
went back to the dorms to call the 
Security Office and we were told 
that Dr. Strick was responsible.
We then called him; Dr. Strick 
blamed the work stoppage on 
Chief Young.
Chief Young said he was “rest­
ing” and simply hung up on us. .< 
The next morning we found that 
the lock on our door had been 
changed and none of us would be 
allowed to enter the station for 
any reason.
A letter to us from Dr. Strick 
said that we were to be allowed to 
remove from the station whatever 
we needed to operate. But security 
ignored the letter and by Satur­
day we weren’t even allowed to • 
broadcast from Skibo. j^
We rounded up personal equip- 
ment and went on the air with 
makeshift facilities in Hamer- 
schlag House.
Although we have been allowed 
back in our studios in Skibo, we 
face the prospect of having to re­
move the egg crates because the 
administration is still not satis­
fied.
We have tried to cooperate with 
the administration. In return, we 
have been treated with rudeness; 
we have been pushed around; we 
have not been informed of the 
school’s actions beforehand; and 
we have not been allowed to take 
the responsibility in this situation 
that we have shown on other 
equally serious occasions.
We think that the administra­
tion sliould start considering its 
students as people capable of 
thought and responsibility and not 
as insects to be trampled under- t 
foot.

G. A. Cowan, Dr. Of Chemistry, 
Is 1965 Winner Of AEC Award
by Howard Weiss
Dr. George A. Cowan was named a 1965 winner of the 
Ernest O. Lawrence Memorial Award.
This annual award is given by 
the Atomic Energy Commission to 
no more than five scientists for 
“meritorious contributions in the 
field of atomic energy.”
Dr. Cowan, a group leader at 
Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory,

nuclear explosions as neutron 
sources for the measurement of 
fundamental physical quantities.
The award will be presented 
formally April 29 at the National 
Academy of Science headquarters 
in Washington. It consists of a 
medal, citation, and $5000.
Dr. Cowan received his B.S. in 
chemistry from Worcester Poly­
technic Institute in 1941. At 
Princeton University in 1941 to 
1942 he worked on early cyclotron 
research. During the war years, 
he played a major role in the 
atomic bomb project, doing re­
search at the University of Chi­
cago.

Synchronized 
Swimming Club 
Holds Tryouts
The Carnegie Tech Synchron­
ized Swimming Club is open to 
anyone who enjoys the water, boy 
or girl. Background experience is 
not necessary because part of the 
practice time is devoted to learn­
ing basic skills. Part of each 
practice session is used for prac­
tice of basic sculling, ballet legs, 
and tubs, which build up endur­
ance as well as grace and control.
Synchronized swimming is ballet j 
in the water, and involves the j 
basic principles of ballet—control, 1 
grace, and co-ordination. Mem­
bers of the club chose apppropri- 
ate music relating to a basic ! 
theme determined by all of the 
members, and arrange movements j 
and stunts in the water to cor- j 
respond to the movements of the 
music. The choreography is done j 
by the more experienced members j 
who then teach the routines to the 
newer members. These water rou- | 
tines can vary from solos to 
twelve girl ballets, and can also j 
vary according to theme, costume, j 
music, and difficulty.
In the spring of 1936 the swim­
ming club was reorganized be- ; 
cause of the interest of a small 
group of people who really en­
joyed swimming. Near the end of 
the semester a show was present­
ed, and although it was a small 
scale, it was impressive. This 
show was open to the public and 
served to stimulate interest on the 
Tech campus. The following year 
the group had more than quad­
rupled in size, and by May the 
group was able to present a well 
organized and impressive pro­
gram, “Kaleidoscope,” based on 
the theme of color. T he theme 
was presented through the selec­
tion of music which suggested 
color, the use of costumes and 
props, and particularly through 
the use of colored lighting which 
created a kaleidoscope atmosphere 
of sparkling color on the water.
This year, under the leadership 
of Nancy Mayberry and the in­
struction of Miss Fisk, the group 
has already begun to work on the 
program tentatively scheduled for 
April 30 and May 1. The group 
has been working on basic skills 
and is beginning to fit the skills 
to the music which will be used 
in the show. The goal of the club 
is to present a show of variety 
which not only retains the interest 
of the audience, but also chal­
lenges the performers.
Practice is held every Tuesday 
evening from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. in 
the Tech swimming pool. The 
time is divided between instruc­
tion in basic skills, practice on the 
actual numbers for the show, and 
individual practice on weak spots. 
The club welcomes new members, 
whether or not they have had ex­
perience in water ballet. If you 
can smile, you can be a part of the 
show, for the most difficult trick is 
to remember to smile while per­
forming a number. If you are in­
terested, come to the Tech pool 
Tuesday, evening at 7, bringing a 
suit, a smile, and any ideas you 
might have for a number.

The institute will be sponsored 
by a grant of over $59,000 from 
the United States Office of Edu­
cation.
The project will place special 
emphasis on the history of the 
non-western world, termed “the 
area in which world history teach­
ers are weakest,” by co-directors 
Edwin Fenton, professor of his­
tory, and Richard B. Ford, clin­
ical professor of history at Car­

In Jag B-Ball
Playoff berths in the IM Minor 
League Basketball were decided 
earlier this week with two semi­
final playoff games to be held to­
morrow night at 7:00 and 8:00. 
The championship game will be 
held Monday night at 7:00 in the 
girls gym (no reflection on the

Last week in the American 
League, the Betas warmed up for 
the final week by downing the 
EE Grads 41-20. In their tune- 
up, the Plumbers overcame TDP, 
36-29. The Tau Delts continued 
their losing ways, falling to the 
EE Grads, 45-30 as Holmes hit 
for 22 points for the Grads.
In the Continentals League, the 
Dunkers upended ATO “C,” 41- 
24, despite the inspired play of 
“Grabber” Magnuson. The Dorm 
Gophers ripped BTP “T” in the 
only other league game played.
It is suggested that if ATO and 
TDP continue in their losing 
ways, a playoff game to decide 
the worse team on campus be 
held.

SPORTS
IM Basketball Season Ends;
Playoffs To Begin Tonight
Tonight at 7:00 the first-round playoffs in I.M. Basketball 
begin in the gymnasium. The two lid-lifters will find defend­
ing champion GSIA meeting SAE, and Sigma Nu meeting
a surprisingly fast PKA team. At*-----------------------------------------------------
8:00 Ray Morrison leads his Trips 
to Win against the Finks in what 
could be the game of the eve­
ning, and the Grad Thors take on 
a much smaller GSIA “B” team.
Alpha Tau Omega makes its 
first playoff appearance tomorrow 
evening at 7:00 against the Vic­
tims, while A. J.’s Civil Ham­
mers meet the Frosh at the same 
time. At 8:00 Beta Theta Pi 
turns its full-court press against 
the Dead Beats, and the Grad 
Physics meet Delta Upsilon.
GSIA has to be ranked as the 
pre-tournament favorite on- the 
basis of their size and shooting 
ability. Led by Howie Pifer, the 
Grads finished on top last year 
and are back < stronger than' ever, 
with plenty of depth. Beta Theta 
Pi is led by its sharpshooting trio 
of Dale Johnson, Jim Kamm, and 
Tom Mauretta, and has varsity 
letterman Sam Cupps to crash the 
boards. There is an excellent pos­
sibility of a GSIA-BTP semi­
final encounter next Wednesday, 
and if this becomes a reality, the 
gym should be filled. In addition 
to GSIA and BTP, the upper 
playoff bracket also includes the 
Civil Hammers, the Finks, and 
Morrison’s Trips to Win, three 
very good basketball teams.
In the lower bracket, Alpha 
Tau Omega presents the most 
balanced aggregation. Led by the 
strong rebounding and shooting 
Bill Schliep, ATO has three ac­
curate point procedures in Fred 
Brown, Frank Oliver and A1 
Green, and three strong rebound­
ers in Jim Hagarman, Tom Kline 
and Dan DeVos. The lower brack­
et, however, has just as many 
strong teams as the upper one, 
if not more. The Grad Physics 
are probably the tallest team in 
the program, while the Grad 
Thors are well represented with 
height also.
Sigma Nu has looked quite im­
pressive at times in rolling over 
four straight opponents. Should 
SN win tonght, and ATO defeat 
the Victims tomorrow nighft, then 
they would meet on Monday, and 
anytime ATO and Sigma Nu clash 
in a playoff encounter, the raft­
ers in the gym bend a little bit 
more However, PKA stands in 
the way of SN’s tournament prog­
ress, and PKA will be more than 
a little bit stubborn.
Although they have to take on 
the powerful Grad Physics, it 
would be ridiculous to count DU 
out at this time. The playoff field 
is rounded out by SAE, the Frosh,
the Victims, the Dead Beats, and 
GSIA “B’\ Although these teams
are classified as underdogs, they 
have everything to gain and 
nothing to lose, and a little in­
centive in the right place at the 
right time could produce an up­
set.
Alpha Tau Omega won the big­
gest game of the season so far, 
with a 37-31 win over the Trips ^ 
to Win, despite an outstanding * 
19 point performance by Ray Mor­
rison. With the largest crowd of 
the season on hand, ATO came 
from a one-point deficit at half- 
time to pull away in the closing 
minutes. Fred Brown and Bill 
Schliep led the Tau’s with 15 
and 11 points respectively, but 
without the defensive play of 
Frank Oliver, Tom Kline, and Dan 
Devos, their effort would have 
been in vain. It took the best £) 
team effort the Tau’s have shown 
to date to clinch the victory, as 
Morrison and Co. kept the issue 
in doubt until the closing min­
utes.
Earlier in the week an inspired 
BSR team gave the Tau’s all they 
could handle for three quarters 
before ATO pulled away to a
40-28 win. Oliver paced the Tau’s 
with 17 points in this one, while ^ 
Hochhauser and Spector com- <11 
bined for 17 of Beta Sigs points. 
The Dunkers downed PKA “B”
41-30 in other league action.
The Grad Physics beat Phi Kap 
43-22, and SAE 48-24 to clinch 
first place in the WARRIORS 
LEAGUE, while GSIA rolled over 
TDP 66-24, and the Victims 50- 
30. BTP’s full court press al­
most failed them in the second 
half against the Archers but the s 
shooting of Dale Johnson insured u 
a 57-45 victory and GSIA “G” 
60-16, and ATO “B” finally won 
one, defeating the Good Guys 37- 
27 as Scott McCormick and de­
fensive ace Flash Connors scored 
10 points each.
The Finks beat the Flat Feet 
52-33, and then won the big one 
over DU, 50-38, as Harry Ste­
wart scored 21 points. Sigma Nu 
beait the Finks “A” 56-40, and \ 
the Grad Lokis 69-19, while the 
tournament - bound Frosh beat 
BTP “B” 36-16.
Finally, the Civil Hammers 
nosed out PKA 45-40 in a close 
one, the Delts nipped the Foul 
Outs 36-31, and .the Dead Beats 
whipped DU “B” 75-18 in a warm­
up for tomorrow’s encounter 
against Beta Theta Pi.

Cagers Lose To Pitt, Fean;
Final Tech Record Stands 4-15
Rifle Team 
Beats W&J, 
Duquesne
Displaying a great deal of depth 
for the first time this season, the 
Carnegie Tech rifle team rolled 
up two more important victories 
over Duquesne and W&J. Car­
negie shot 1414 in both matches, 
twice equalling their three-year 
high scoreshot two weeks ago 
against Allegheny. Duquesne man­
aged a 1380, and W&J a 1381.
Rich Damberg and Scott Mc­
Cormick put on the two best 
performances of their career, 
teaming with Elbert Whitelatch 
to pace the Tartans.
Damberg fired a superb 100- 
95-93—288 against Duquesne and 
a 99-93-95—287 against W&J. 
McCormick, after a dismal 263 
against Indiana last week, soared 
to a fine 100-98-85—283 against 
Duquesne and a 99-95-90—284 
the next day.
Elbert Whitlatch turned in two 
more top performances for Car­
negie. He shot a 99-95-89—283 
against the Dukes and a 99-96-90 
—285 against the Prexies.

The basketball brochure issued by Carnegie Tech at the 
beginning of the season was fronted with a picture of Na­
poleon, holding a basketball, and captioned “These winter
campaigns are always the rough-^ 
est.” Compared with Tech’s re­
cently completed season, however, 
the Little General’s Russian cam­
paign was a tea party.
Holding true to form, the Tar­
tans finished the year by losing 
their last two games, 80-60 to Pitt, 
and 79-67 to Fenn. These last 
futile efforts managed to produce 
a final record of four wins and 
fifteen losses, Tech’s worst season i 
since 1961-62’s four and twenty- 
one mark.
The Tartans looked the part of 
giant-killers against Pitt . . . for 
the first eight minutes of the 
game. Jumping off to a not-so- 
quick 4-0 lead. Tech played the 
Panthers on even terms. The 
presence of President Horton 
Guyford Stever — surprise, sur­
prise — in the stands seemed to 
have some spiritual effect, and 
Tech managed to climb to a 13-12 
lead with 11:43 remaining.
Pitt Takes Lead
All good things must come to an 
end, though, and Pitt quickly out- 
scored the Tartans, 24 to 7, in the 
next seven minutes, thereby end­
ing any hopes of an upset. The ¦ 
Panthers took a 43-27 half-time; 
lead, assuring the final outcome.1 
The closest Tech came in the sec­
ond half was 68-51, with Neil 
Houser leading the “rally,” with 
six minutes left. Pitt managed ,to 
hold off, however, and walked 
away with an 80-60 victory.
Tartans Lost Last Game
In the last game of the season,
against Fenn, Tech stayed right 
with the Foxes throughout the 
first half, as evidenced by the fact 
that there were fourteen tied 
scores. A basket by Denny Lenk 
in the last minute gave the Cleve­
landers a 35-33 half-time lead, 
one of the few times this season 
that Tech hasn’t held the lead at 
the midway point.
The second half saw the Tar- 
i tans tie the game up 37-37 in the 
j early moments. It was then that 
I Fenn made its move, and, within 
| six minutes, they held a 48-37 
| lead. With Tech’s shooting con­
tinuing on the cold side, the Foxes 
| upped their lead to 62-44 before 
I Tech went into a full-court press. 
Continualy stealing the ball, the 
Tartans moved back to within ten, 
but the rally was too late to be 
j a deciding factor, and Fenn pulled 
| out a 79-67 victory.
Playing his final game, senior 
! Hank Werronen led the Tech at- 
! tack with 17 points, and was 
I aided by Don Keefer’s 16 and Jeff 
| Kalin’s 12. A season’s review, full 
statistics, and a preview of next 
year will appear in next week’s 
Tartan.

TO 118 OAKLAND AVE.
Howard Graham and Bob Fritz 
rounded out the scoring against 
Duquesne with a pair of 280’s. 
Ted Mankovich fired a 279 and 
Mike Knepley a disappointing 
278, but both failed to place, the 
first time in three years that such 
a high score did not count for 
Tech.
On Saturday, at W&J, Bob 
Fritz shot another 280 and Knep­
ley a 278 to place fourth and 
fifth. Graham was sixth at 277, 
Westlake and Froelich shot 275’s 
and Minnear finished at 272. R. B. 
Miller of W&J was high for the 
match with a 99-96-93—288.
These two victories pushed 
Carnegie’s second semester record 
to 5 and 3, very good consider­
ing that six of their eight matches 
were against the top four teams 
in the Allegheny Intercollegiate 
Rifle League. The Tartans aver­
aged 1406 in their final eight 
matches, almost fifteen points 
higher than first semester. The re­
turn of Mike Knepley and the 
development of five freshmen, 
Mankovich, Graham, Westlake, 
Froelich, and Minnear. have made 
Carnegie one of the top teams 
in Western Pennsylvania.
This weekend, Coach Murphy 
will take his shooters to Kings 
Point, New York to compete in 
the NRA Intercollegiate Sectional 
Matches. Tech will be shooting 
against Penn State, the Merchant 
Marine Academy, and several 
other schools, and the scores will 
be compared with those from sim­
ilar matches all over the United 
States.
