TAGS TO BE SOLD SOON
The latest plans for campus week 
ncludes some changes and improve- 
nents. The program in a general way 
s complete; however there will no 
ioubt be some additions and re­
visions. The committee is spending a 
0t of time in working out details, so 
1S to avoid any discrepancies which 
¡yoiild cause any inconsistencies dur­
ing the series of events. The co- 
jperation of the students is needed 
Bud any suggestions or assistance 
would be much appreciated. Any one 
¡pho has any ideas should get in touch 
vith some member of the com­
mittee.
Campus Week Tags.
As a means ofv financing the fes­
tival a scheme has been worked out 
thereby every student and alumnus 
vil! be required to purchase a tag. 
This is the best method of securing 
the money needed with the least 
amount of trouble. The tags will be 
Sut on sale during the week of May
the week before campus week. The 
;ost will be 50 cents each. The holder 
will be entitled to the following credit 
discount: Full credit for campus
week show. Full value for Tech 
music festival. Full credit for Mardi 
Gras. Fifty cents on music festival 
dances and 20 cents credit on the 
circus. These tags will also identify 
the owner as being eligible to enjoy 
the other events on the program. Also 
that he is a “Tech” booster.
General Assembly to Be Dropped.
There will be no general assembly 
to open the program as was pre­
viously announced. It has been dis­
cussed by the committee and the con­
sensus of opinion is that a vaudeville 
show would be more interesting and 
in keeping with the occasion. Conse­
quently a program of stunts, musical 
numbers and home talent entertain­
ment is being arranged. The show 
will start the nineteen-twenty-one 
campus week at 10:30 in the Carnegie 
Music Hall. Everybody is expected to 
bo there and we will perhaps fill the 
hall to its full capacity.
Campus Week Parade.
Following the Campus Week Show 
there will be a big automobile parade 
oi about 60 machines. The cars will 
be decorated with signs, posters and 
other paraphernalia which will be 
characteristic of campus week. All 
participants will be in costume or 
¡masquerade. Both student and 
alumni will take part. There are 
prizes offered by the alumni for the 
best costumes and decoration of cars.
Circus in Evening Only.
Owing to the impractibility of run­
ning the feature stunts of the circus 
more than once because of the im­
mense lot of preparation, it has been 
decided to have the circus on the 
evening of Saturday, May 14. The ad-

RIFLE CLUB TO HOLD 
INTER-CLASS MATCH
The Tech Rifle Club has planned 
several special attractions for the 
near future. The team may be sent 
to Camp Perry to compete for an all- 
American college team to be sent to 
England to match with a similar 
selection there.
An inter-class match is also on the 
:club's mind and all departments of 
the school will of course be eligible. 
The requirements will be a certain 
Dumber of targets to be shot by each 
man competing and a very small 
charge will be collected to cover the 
ammunition expenses. The class 
making the highest score for con­
secutive number of targets consider­
ing their number of entrees will re­
ceive the inter-class cup.
And then, a Freshman cup for the 
Glebes to try for. Freshmen from all 
departments will be eligible upon 
Presenting their registration cards. 
The individual making the highest 
total score for consecutive required 
targets will receive the cup. A small 
charge will be made here also, as for 
the inter-class shoot.
All of these matches are to be shot 
°u the club range in the Design 
School loge. More information con­
cerning these matches will be. in next 
Peek's Tartan.
The team recently completed their 
inter-collegiate matches with a dual 
match with Colgate, shot April 16, for 
^'hich the score has not been ren­
dered as yet. The last reports placed 
toe Plad team with the 6even highest 
Allege teams of the 27 competing.
These dual matches have been shot

ASPINWALL RECEIVES
BEAUX ARTS FIRST MEDAL
At the recent Judgment, held at 
the Beaux Arts Institute, April 12, 
the Senior Architects received some 
of the best honors. Harry T. Aspin- 
wall was awarded a first medal and 
the Municipal Art Society Prize, the 
latter being ?50 offered annually by 
the Municipal Art Society of New 
York on the Fourth 'Class “A” project 
of the season. Simpson received a 
second medal. The subject for the 
competition was “A Bridge Plaza,” a 
very interesting problem, which dealt 
with the development of two adjoin­
ing rectangular blocks for a suitable 
approach to a large suspension 
bridge.
“A Small Railroad Station” and “An 
Entrance Through a Colonnade." 
Junior and Sophomore projects re­
spectively, were finished last Thurs­
day. These will be judged in New 
York.
The second preliminary sketch for 
the Paris Prize was completed last 
Saturday, April 9, by Paul and Rus­
sell TLmpson, Diaz and Lashmit.
FIRST DEBATE HELDJT TECH
Our Men Made Good Showing. 
Judges’ Decision Favor Op­
posing Institutions
KANSAS COURT TOPIC
Last Friday night Tech participated 
in its first inter-collegiate debate. 
The question was: Resolved, That
the several states should enact legis­
lation providing for the establishment 
of courts of industrial relations sim­
ilar to the Kansas Court. The affirm­
ative team, consisting of C. Lurie, 
K. J. Lawrence and L. J. Whitehead, 
debated the negative team of West 
Virginia University, consisting of P. 
Clark, H. Snyder and H. C. Darling­
ton. The negative team, consisting of 
J. G. McRae, W. L. Reilly and J. 
Goundry, met the W. & J. affirmative 
debaters, G. C. Lucas, P. D. Carmich- 
ale and L. D. Faust, at Washington, 
Pa.
The decisions in both cases were 
awarded to the opposing teams. This, 
however, need not discourage the 
supporters, of debating here for there 
are many elements of uncertainty en­
tering into debate decisions. The men 
who ’ represented the institute are to 
be congratulated for their showing in 
Tech’s initial contest and deserve a 
lot of credit for the amount of work 
they put in on the subject. Character­
istic of the' spirit of the school they 
represented no .effort was spared and 
many sacrifices were made in pre­
paring for the contest. Prof. Peter­
son, coach of the squad, who has had 
an extended amount of experience in 
debating worked continually with the 
men and through his efforts they 
have gained much valuable knowledge 
in the forensic art.
There can be no doubt that debat-, 
ing has come to Tech to remain and 
with the experience gained from the 
initial contest we can w.ell look for­
ward to a successful future. We 
should be far from discouraged over 
the outcome for the institutions met 
by the teams have had debating teams 
for many years past.
KAPPA SIGMA INSTALLS 
CHAPTER AT TECH
Opheleum Fraternity was installed 
as the Delta Alpha Chapter of Kappa 
Sigma Fraternity, April 12, 13 and 
14.
As a local the Delta Alpha Chapter 
was known as Opheleum. The fratern­
ity was originally known as the 
Boosters’ Club but in 1913 was norm­
ally organized as Opheleum Fratern­
ity. Mr. Fred J. Hartman, secretary 
of the Industrial Board of Pennsyl­
vania, was directly connected with 
its foundation. Ever since it has 
been a flourishing and well-known 
organization on the campus.
Steps were taken to petition Kappa 
Sigma in 1920, the formal petition be­
ing submitted that summer. Notifica/- 
tion of the granting of the charter 
was received March 14, 1921.
Installation was conducted by Mr.
O. J. Decker, District Grand Master; 
Mr. R. P. Sloan of Pittsburgh, Kappa 
Sigma Alumni Association and repre­
sentation from W. & J., University of 
Pittsburgh, University of West Vir­
ginia, Penn State and Bucknell.
Fifty members were taken in at 
this time.
Tuesday evening a dinner was 
served at the house with a celebration 
following. During the evening the 
formal installation and presentation 
of the charter took place.
Wednesday, April 13, a formal 
dance was held in the William Penn 
Hotel ball room; some 200 couples 
attending. Music was furnished by 
Art Giles 10-piece orchestra.
Sunday afternoon the new chapter 
held open house from 3 to 5.
Kappa Sigma is the seventh Na­
tional fraternity to establish a chap­
ter at Tech. With the installation of 
the new chapter Tech secures one of 
the largest college fraternities. Chap­
ters in neighboring colleges are sit­
uated at W. & J., University of Pitts­
burgh, Penn State, Case, Cornell, 
Bucknell and West Virginia.
The following are the initiates: 
Clifford B. Connelley, State com­
missioner of Labor and Industry; 
John T. Morris, director, Division of 
Industries (active member); Fred J. 
Hartman, secretary of Industrial 
Board of Pennsylvania; Dr. William 
L. Marks (active member).

CLOSE OF CONCERT SEASON
One of the best concerts ever ren­
dered by Tech musical organizations 
was given by the Musical Clubs at 
Carnegie Musical Hall last Friday 
evening. This was the sixteenth an­
nual home concert to be given by 
the clubs' and it was very well re­
ceived by a good sized audience. 
From “Amict” to “Dear Old Tech” the 
ensemble work of the two clubs was 
splendid, while the solos, group selec­
tions and novelties went across in 
fine fashion.
The first two lumbers were ren­
dered by the <ilee Club and Mandolin 
Club respectively and these were fol­
lowed by a solo by R. R. Sawhill. Mr. 
Sawhill has been doing splendid work 
with the club all season and the 
ready applause given him at the con­
cert was justly deserved by reason 
of his delightful rendition of his 
numbers. The saxaphone quartet got 
a great hand on its clever work and 
only lack of time prevented response 
to the second encore. A. B. Speer, 
tenor soloist, charmed the audience 
with two beautiful numbers, which he 
rendered in his usual easy and bril­
liant manner.
A marching song, “Mulligan Mus­
keteers,” by the Glee Club, was the 
opening number of the second part 
of the concert. “Novelty” is the 
right word to apply to the orchestra 
that gave the next number. This does 
not refer to the personnel of the 
group, but to the unique interpreta­
tion they gave to several popular 
selections. It was the jazziest jazz 
ever jazzed and was done in such a 
pleasing way that the audience was 
only Satisfied when a quartet from the 
noV^lly orchestra responded to the 
encore with a seiectlon that ran the 
whole gamut of jazz possibilities. Mr.

JOURNALISM CAN 
AID AVERAGE MAN
What journalism can do for the 
average man was the main topic of an 
address delivered by Dr. P. I. Reed, of 
the department of journalism, to Uni- 
versity students and townspeople at 
convocation exercises in Commence­
ment hall this morning. Dr. Reed said 
that the main benefit the average 
man can dorlve from a study of jour­
nalism is a clear, incisive, accurate, 
comprehensive use of the English 
language. 1-Ie said that men in all 
professions and linos of business 
would be beneflted by this ability.
“What can journalism do for me?
“ ‘For me’ means ‘for everybody.’ 
The answer is.found primarily in the 
reason why courses in journalism 
are given in this University. The 
first reason is extremely practical 
and applies to everybody and is the 
reason why Mercer University re­
quires a course in journalism of her 
graduates. It is: It teaches one to
be a skillful wielder of that everyday 
tool we all have to use, namely, the 
English language. ,
“Regardless* of one’s occupation, a 
person’s success is more or less com­
mensurate with his ability to tell 
others clearly, forcefully, pleasingly 
and economically just what he has in 
his mind. The demand is strongly go­
ing up from the business people: 
‘Why can’t you send us young people 
who can write decent, everyday Eng­
lish?*
“The characteristics of a news story 
are: Clearness, brevity, accuracy.
Good, everyday English requires lit­
tle more. To acquire these charac­
teristics the reporter does not write 
exercises for the perusal of his pro­
fessional teachers, but honest-to-good- 
ness stories about real people and 
events.
“These are a few things that the 
reporter must do:
“Tell the truth, and nothing but 
the truth.
“Put an important idea at the be­
ginning of every sentence.
“Find the one noun for each idea, 
the one adjective- to qualify the 
noun, and the one verb to give that 
noun life.
“Remember that a sentence is never 
good enough that has to be read twice 
to be understood.
“Tell the Important facts and then 
stop; don’t pad.
"A person who can do these few 
things will] be recognized as a good 
practical writer.
Will Aid in Business Success.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY
TODAY AT MUSIC HALL
General Assembly will be held at 
eleven-thirty today at Music. Hall. 
Doctor Clark, traveler and lecturer, 
will give a talk, both educational 
and humorous, on the Far East. Dr. 
Clark has traveled quite extensively 
through Turkey and the Far East 
and is thoroughly at home with, his 
subject. There will be no sollcita 
tion of funds.

STUDENT COUNCIL 
BUSY MEETING
F. I. Smith Sent to Conference. 
Point System Presented
The Student Council had a very 
busy time at its meeting last week.
F. I. Smith was appointed to repre­
sent the Council and Tech at an In­
ter-Collegiate Conference on Under­
graduate Government held at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technol­
ogy, April 15 and 16. This conference, 
made up of representatives of the 
biggest schools of the East, was held 
for the purpose of discussing the 
problems of undergraduate govern­
ment and student activities.
John Todd presented the report of 
the Point System Committee. It pro 
vides for a maximum of 10 points in 
any one activity with a limit or 20 
points per year, above which no stud­
ent may go. An unusual feature of 
the system, worked out by Todd and 
appearing in no other point system 
is that which requires a minimum of 
two points in activities for gradua­
tion. The report was accopted and 
sont to the Board of Administration 
and Board of Trustees for accept­
ance.
Alpha Kappa Tau, a musical honor­
ary fraternity, presented a constltu 
tion for Council's consideration. 
Hammann, Good and Miss Griflln 
wore appointed a committee to in­
vestigate musical as. well as other 
honorary fraternities in other schools. 
The constitution of the Camoglo 
Masque Club was tabled, pending 
further investigation.
Bloom presented sovoral cuts for 
Council insignia. An excellent de­
sign was accoptod. Bar pins are to 
be glvon the M. M. D. representatives 
and pins to the mou.
Somo discussion was given to a let­
ter from Dean Scales regarding form­
ing a Y. M. C. A. hero and obtaining a
Y secretary to handlo its affairs. The 
Coinmittoe on Rollglous Services re* 
portod that although the chapel ser­
vices were very successful It was 
thought advisable not to hold any 
more services this year, but to start 
them oarly next year.
“UNDINE" CROWDS ARTS
THEATER LAST WEEK
Miss Muriel Brown’s fajry play, 
"Undine,” an adaptation of the well- 
known story by La Motte Fouque, at­
tained successful ‘ production last 
week in the Arts Theater, it delighted 
its audience and, in a less crowded 
schedule, would have had a consider­
able run. On Saturday afternoon, in­
deed, an extra matinee was given for 
school children. All the children of 
Pittsburgh would have a chance to 
see it If the civic and artistic con­
sciousness of the city were sufficient­
ly alert.
Miss Brown's somewhat leisurely 
and choppy dramatization preserves 
so much of the fairy-tale character 
that one must be indeed child-like to 
approach it properly and appreciate 
it fully. Of fairy stuff it has the 
fancifulness, the utter blackness and 
whiteness of characterization, the 
spells and wonder and a naive sim­
plicity and directness of utterance. 
Perhaps her narrative original has 
tempted her to shift her locale almost 
wilfully; the attempt to stage a 
scene in a boat on the Danube is 
fore-doomed. The . river is infinitely 
more effective off stage. The writing 
is somewhat too plain and ••simple, 
and the reiteration of the soul motif 
is of a deadly monotony. Kuhleborn 
was more than half right when he 
said, peevishly, “Forget thy soul.”
Professor Stevens’ productions are 
sure to be rich in decorative values. 
So it Is that one recalls here, rather 
than the intricacies nt the action or 
the popplngs up and down the trap­
door, the lines and color of the 
Island sceno, Undine on the terrace 
seat, Bertalda-'s dark and haughty 
transit pant a green sky and the 
astounding Illusion of the sea depths. 
Sovoral of the costumes designed' by 
Joseph Mullen abet the pictorial 
values.
The most difficult acting problem is 
Miss Hazel Beck’s In; the part of 
Undine. Hers Is the only role of any 
psychological complexity. Since the

PLEBES’ POVERTY DAYSUCCESS
Winners, Exempted From Reg­
ulations, Picked at Assemb­
lies—Parade
GIRLS READILY RESPOND
The first four schools Poverty Day, 
held last Wednesday, came up to all 
expectations. It was a look into the 
future and can probably be compared 
with a reunion of “Tech” students 30 
years hence if dressed as their means 
will provide. The Plebes first gath­
ered at the various assemblies for 
judgment by the upperclassmen who 
judiciously selected the winners.
A photograph of the whole group,of 
Plebes was taken and the end of the 
first four-schooled poverty day was 
over. Needless to say the four schools 
experiment easily proved a success 
and caused constant enjoyment from 
the upper classmen and joy from the 
selected Plebes, who will now escape 
further intimidation from their seo- 
oiul year friends.
IN INDUSTRIES 
Who says that M. M. D. Plebes have 
no spirit? They certainly had it on 
Poverty Day. Scarcely a girl in the 
entire class did not “dross up” to the 
entire satisfaction and enjoyment of 
the school. Indeed so splondid was 
the spirit shown that the committee, 
with the approval of Mrs. Scales, de­
cided to exompt' oiglit from Plobo 
regulations, Instead of tlio Ilvo, as or­
iginally planned.
The lucky oight are the following: 
Hourietto Kell, Betty Krldlor, Mary 
Anna Downs, Elma Davis, Mildred 
Lucas, Ida Kellum, Mary Louise Stol- 
zenbach and Blair Jossop.

CHEER LEADERS’ CLASS MEETS 
EVERY WED. AND FRIDAY 4:30
The class for cheer leaders, under 
the supervision of G. W. First, will 
meet every Wednesday and Friday at 
4:30 in the gym. The object of these 
classes is to arouse dormant en­
thusiasm and to prepare all who are 
interested for the advancement of 
this work. Every one in the Junior, 
Sophomore and Freshmen classes is 
eligible. At the first divisional as­
semblies next fall ample opportunity 
will be afforded those who liavo 
shown interest and ability In this 
work and elections for cheer leaders 
of each division will immediately fol­
low. From time to time leaders in 
the Student Council will select a clioer 
leader for the school. At the end of 
his term he will receive a Major C 
with a bar. All divisional leaders will 
automatically become his assistants.
This is by no means a small job and 
it is seemingly made light of at the 
present. In order to maintain and 
extend our present stride in athletics 
athletes must not only bo developed, 
but men to lead the student body In 
backing them must bo discovered and 
advanced. If Interested be at the 
gym today at 4:80 and you will have 
room and time to open up.

On Saturday morning the entire 
Science Club met at the Clty-County 
building and were shown through the 
Civic Health Service laboratories in 
that building. Tho trip proved very 
interesting.

“OPPORTUNITY”
Now that the end of the school year is approaching, the discus­
sion of the opportunities of the college student in business life is 
more and more frequently the subject of discourse, especially among 
seniors. The tone of these discussions, in other years usually optim­
istic, has, under the stress of a general industrial depression and a 
bearish labor market, become much less roseate. ,
In spite of the general pessimistic conditions, however, the out­
look for the average college man is brighter than it has been for the 
last five or six years. We have but recently emerged from a period, 
of inverted values, fostered by the stress of the World War. The 
value of brains, it seemed, sank to its lowest level in a decade at least. 
But a reaction from the period when a plumber 01* even the meanest 
sort of manual laborer could command several times the salary of a 
professional man has begun even now, and it is certain that such a 
tendency is bound to continue to a still greater extent. The man 
with education and brains is beginning to come back into his own, 
and the period of inflated prosperity for the unschooled is noticeably 
at an end. Even during the present depression in labor conditions, 
it is not the technically trained man who is unemployed.
Most of the discussion one hears on the subject is influenced by a 
yicw of the past, and does not take into consideration the inevitable 
influence which the very facts, that discourage the speaker must have 
on the future. There is no doubt that a period of greater opportunity 
and prosperity for the college graduate is at hand than there has 
been for a good many years.
II: you have succeeded in gaining any of the advantages from 
your college training that you should, there is no doubt that there 
is a broad field awaiting you in the world’s work. We like to recall 
what Cardinal Newman says in “The Aim of a University Educa­
tion.” We will find much to do, and will be ready at all times to do 
it if we keep in mind his ideal, that a college education “aims at 
raising the intellectual tone of society, at cultivating the public mind, 
at purifying the national taste, at supplying true principles to popular 
enthusiasm and fixed aims to Hjpular aspiration, at giving enlarge­
ment and sobriety to the ideals of the age, at facilitating the exercise 
of political power, and refining the intercourse of private life.”
The value of brains, and of the power to do what is expected of 
a college graduate as so well expressed in this quotation is and al­
ways will be recognized, and in the impending reaction their utility 
will be recoxnized to a greater extent than ever before.

MUSICAL CONCERT
WELL RECEIVED
(Continued From Page One.) 
Gannon gave a couple of clever rep­
resentations of Plebe life and sang 
clever parodies which depicted the 
trials and tribulations of poor Plebe.
The janitor specialty by Mr. Sellers 
and Mr, English met with the same 
ready appreciation it has received all 
season. Mr. Sellers’ clever work with 
his “Hawaiian violin,” formed from a 
mop handle and a single violin string, 
was greeted with a storm of applause 
which it justly merited. A black face 
act by Mr. Le Blanc and Mr, Agnew 
scored many a good laugh. Tho pair 
did tho burnt cork scene perfectly and 
introduced a groat doal of local jokes 
which gave an added zest to the 
humor of t.hoir work. Those two com­
edians introduced the closing number 
when they called for that “now song,” 
"Dear Old Tech,’’ which the combined 
chibs sang in a snappy manner.
Following the concert the Musical 
Clubs and a large part of tho audi­
ence attended tho dance given at the 
Schenley Hotel, ’Phis dance was 
given for the clubs and marks the 
formal close of the musical season. 
¦Several post-season concerts have 
been scheduled, to be given .In the 
interest of the Athletic Association. 
The details of these concerts will be 
forthcoming soon.
The Carnegie Chess Club held a 
¿pedal meeting Thursday night for 
the purpose of transacting business 
pertaining to the Pitt match of April 
19.
It was decided that the constitution 
givos tho team manager authority to 
choose the team for this match, re­
gardless of tho fact that the "tourna­
ment” will not be completed before 
that time. Cuthbert, J-Iorelick, Powell 
and Diamond have made the boBt 
records so far. Thirty men are en­
tered in tho local tournament.
CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA
JUNIOR CLAN
An important meeting of the clan, 
which was formerly known as the 
Harrisburg Junior Club, will be held 
Wednesday at 4:30 in Margaret Mor­
rison Recreation Hall. All interested 
should be present, as election of offi­
cers for the ensuing year will be 
held.
The clan has received about a hun­
dred blanks from the head of the 
State Employment Bureau, which are 
to be filled in by clan members and 
returned to the bureau, where they 
will be placed on file. The clan is 
thus rendering an unusual service to 
its members In the way of providing 
employment, both permanent and for 
the summer vacation.
All students whose homes are with­
in a 100-mile radius of Harrisburg, 
Pennsylvania, are eligible for mem­
bership and should see Miss Schöm­
berg, Bargaret Morrison Division or 
P. D. Good.
Y. W. C. A.
Before Easter vacation the Y. W.
C. A. elected Miss Mary E. Bowman 
as their new Faculty Advisor. Then 
they gave her a, party, with the Y. 
W. C. A. girls from P. C. W and Pitt 
as their guests, to meet Miss Bow­
man. Miss Bowman comes in contact 
with all of the girls and everyone 
loves her, in fact they are all quite 
devoted to her and we all feel that 
when things get going we are going to 
have some real times.

The Tech men from Buffalo got 
together for a short meeting in- the 
dorm! No. 1 club room last Wednes­
day evening. The meeting assumed 
rather of an informal nature, taking 
up the discussion of some sort of an 
outing for the club; this spring. An 
outing trip on the river or a swim­
ming party were the best sugges­
tions. A committee was appointed to 
look into the matter and arrange for 
the affair. Another suggestion for 
the members to think about was that 
of a motor party to come off at Buf­
falo in the early part of the summer.
The members will undoubtedly look 
forward to these outings with much 
interest and anticipation. The club 
is a live organization and is promot­
ing the best interests of Tech in the 
city of Buffalo.
EMPIRE STATE CLUB
The next meeting of the Empire 
State Club will be on Wednesday at 
7:30 in Room 107 of the Dtsign 
School. Plans will be discussed for 
a dance and smoker which are to be 
held in the near future. A constitu­
tion was. adopted at the last meeting 
of tiie club. The latter already num­
bers 35 members.
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
does not boast as much publicity in 
Buffalo and vicinity as M. I. T. or 
Stevens Instituto. One of the chief 
aims of the Empire State Club is to 
boost Tech in that section. Students 
from New York state can further this 
purpose by joining tho club and tak­
ing part in its activities. H. H. John­
son is anxious that all Empire State 
students become members of the 
club, which will be a “big brother” to 
them and help them in every • way 
possible. They are cordially invited 
to attend the meeting on Wednesday.
Bill Says
WHAT TECH WANTS
I heard a Men’s Student Secretary 
say the other day that Carnegie Tech 
is the largest school in the United 
States that does not have a Y. M. C. 
A. on its campus. He also said that 
the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. 
are the largest and greatest fraternity 
and sorority in the -world! Did you 
ever think of it just that way? Per­
haps you have. But if you haven’t— 
can you imagine anything which 
would build up the character of a 
school more quickly and more firmly 
than the Christian moulding of 2,300 
four-foid lives. We must be four-fold 
to he real men and women. We can 
perfectly qualify for the moral, 
physical and intellectual standards— 
hut without the spirit of love and 
service we Can never know real hap­
piness.
An(l can you imagine anything more 
desirable than to have a real man, a 
real live wire put upon the campus to 
do that moulding? A real, truth lov­
ing man, a Y. M. C. A. secretary who 
can connect every man with the stud­
ents of the whole country, even more, 
the whole world?
If you want a Y. M. C. A. on the 
Tech campus,.say so! Perhaps your 
saylngi so will go a long way towards 
its realization.

Plebes Score 7 5 Points; Soph­
omores Are Nearest Rival
The Plebes carried away the honors 
of the Spring Inter-Class Meet held 
last Friday., scoring 75 points while 
the Sophomores, their nearest rivals, 
secured 41. The Juniors were third 
with 15 and the Seniors brought up 
the rear with 4 points. Among the 
different schools Industries led with 
79 points, Science was second with 
40 and Design secured 7. The Juniors 
did not secure a point in the track 
events and it looked as if they would 
not score at all until finally Godden 
took first in the javelin throw.
The Plebes took all three places in 
the 220-yard dash, 120-yard high hur­
dles, 220-yard low hurdles and the 
high jump. The Sophomores scored 
first, second and third in two events, 
the mile and the half-mile runs. Smith 
and Lockwood, both Industry Plebes, 
were the best individual scorers, both 
securing two firsts and a third for a 
total of 11 points each. Schillinger. In­
dustry Plebe, and Miller, Science 
Sophomore, were second,, both scor­
ing two firsts for a total of 10 points 
each. Pittman, with 9 points and Mc- 
Phee with 8, were the other high 
scorers.
Lockwood showed great form in 
taking first place in both the 100 and 
220-yard dashes. Tallmon gave him 
a great chase in both, events, how­
ever. Smith led the field in the 220- 
yard low hurdles with a pretty ex­
hibition of hurdling. The mile run 
was a race between Miller and Dyke- 
man with Miller setting the pace. 
When the final sprint came Dykeman 
followed Miller to the tape but was 
not capable of passing him. Miller 
again ran first in the half mile with 
Gotwals his nearest rival.
Cooper of Design gave a pretty ex­
hibition of the half mile, showing 
splendid form.
The class relay was won by the 
Sophomores with the Plebes a close 
second. The 'Seniors came In third 
with the Juniors trailing behind.
In the high jump Smith cleared 
5 foot 5 inches, being a gpod jump for 
so early in the season. Pittman out- 
jumped the others in the broad jumtf, 
going 20 feet 5*6 inches. McPhee took 
first in the pole vault, with 9 feet 6 
inches.,

CAPTAIN HILLER
Carnegie Tech is exceedingly for­
tunate this year in having for captain 
of the track team a capable leader, 
Harvey R. Hiller. This is the third 
season that Hiller has beep with the 
track team and each year he has dis­
played remarkable speed on the cin­
ders.
Hiller prepared for Tech at the 
Attica High iScIiqoI, Attica, N. Y. 
While at that school he played end 
on the school football team and rep­
resented Attica on the tennis court 
for two seasons.
Upon entering Tech, Hiller felt that 
his weight would not justify his mak­
ing the varsity football team and 
turned Ills attention .to the track 
team. He was sent to the Penn Re­
lays in his first year.
Last year Hiller broke the tape in 
every quarter. His speed attracted 
much attention and during last sum­
mer he was a member of the Pitts­
burgh Athletic Association’s track 
team.
With Harvey Hiller at the holm as 
skipper the Plaid cinder disturbers 
should certainly step at a lively 
rate.

IN SCIENCE
The Plebes of Arts were in their 
true attire as often typified in by gen­
eral conceptions of starving artists 
living in a garret in dire poverty. 
Lazeraus, and Miss Johnson looked as 
though they had been in poverty and 
want for arts' sake. Couse and Ar- 
eillo, though not so sad in the state 
of human deterioration were, how­
ever, well dressed for the occasion. 
Lazeraus won first prize for men and 
Miss Johnson for the girls.
These four Plebes are now priv­
ileged to put on some local color.
The work of the committee together 
with the fine co-operation of the stud­
ent body made the Second Annual 
Poverty Day a great success, and an 
event that will be looked forward to 
by Plebes as well as upperclassmen in 
years to come.
UNDINE CROWDS
LITTLE THEATER
(Continued From Page One.) 
elfish touch is not exactly here, she is 
least effective at the beginning of the 
play. Once she acquires a soul and 
the opportunity to suffer, she utilizes 
her material with practiced skill. Her 
acting has a variety which the single 
subject of Undine's interest, the
aforesaid soul, has not. Mr. Lubin’s 
Kuhleborn, the water sprite, steps, 
life-size, out of an Arthur Rackham 
picture. The part is imagined with 
great ingenuity and rendered with 
assurance and resource. Miss Thomp­
son’s Bertalda is a proud, handsome 
creature of malign power and heart- 
lessness. Sir Huldbrand is a role so 
sketchily motivated that Mr. Wil­
lard’s efforts hardly make a character 
of? it. The old gardener, in the hands 
of Mr. Hoag, is sympathetically at­
tuned to the superstitious gloom of 
the close of the play. Among the 
other minor roles one distinguishes 
Mr. McClure’s .faithful Squire, Miss 
Paxton’s sharp-tongued Flsher-wife 
Mr. Speer’s heart-felt old Fisherman, 
and Mr. Schaughency's benign 
Priest., The other characters are of 
incidental or decorative significance.
The tennis court situation needs to 
be made public. There are so very 
few persons in Carnegie Tech who 
really understand how matters stand 
that it becomes imperative to place 
before the general student body the 
full facts, which will include a his­
tory of the Tennis Club, and the 
present solution.
The Tennis Club was formed dur­
ing the summer session of 1920 that 
the expensive courts constructed by 
the institution might be saved for 
student use. No money was avail­
able for the upkeep and the courts 
were fasjt going to destruction due to 
the growth of grass and heavy rains 
¦which caused gullies to be formed.
The club was organized at the sug­
gestion of Mr. Tilbrook and O. K.'d 
by President Ilamerschlag. Two dol­
lars was the fee set for the summer 
session. This was determined after 
investigating the practice at other 
institutions where it was found that a 
fee as high as $10 was charged. Dur­
ing the summer session there were S7 
members, which netted the club 
$174, all of which was used in re­
pairing old equipment, purchasing 
locks for the courts and for five 
new nets. The expense of putting the. 
courts in initial shape was carried by 
the administration. There was some 
deficiency at the end of the summer 
session, but the school met this, as 
they thought the net results were 
worth while.
At the opening of the fall term the 
president asked that the club be re­
organized itnd.be a permanent thing 
here at school. By-laws were drawn 
up and it was determined, that the 
school year should be considered from 
September 15 to June 15. The club 
was reorganized with the dues Tor 
this period at $2 for students and $5 
for faculty mombers, as the adminis­
tration decided that the courts should 
be essentially for students, and faculty 
members desiring to play on the 
courts should pay something in addi­
tion, the idea being to encourage the 
faculty club to institute some moans 
of maintaining the two courts re­
served for faculty and administra­
tion.
The present situation of the Tennis 
Club is onq that is very unsatisfac­
tory. They are outcasts. They lmvo 
no one to report to except themselves. 
It was attompted to place the club 
under the Student Activities Board. 
This failed, as the Activities Board
could not see any reason to classify 
the club as a student activity. The 
plan was for the Activities Board to 
rocognize the club and give an in* 
signia to the manager of the tennis 
courts, thereby making the job com­
petitive among the student body, 
rather than have it a money proposi­
tion. This plan was turned down by 
the Activities Board, with a sugges­
tion to place it before the Student 
Council. This will be done, but in 
the meanwhile the Tennis Club must 
exist and the courts must bo placed 
in a playing condition for the. use of 
the tennis team. More, also, the courts 
must be placed In playing condition 
for the use of the many members of 
the club. The dues are such as to 
make.it impossible to pay any person 
any large sum to do this. Tlierofore 
it becomes necessary for those per­
sons who have the interest of .tennis 
at heart to "get busy” and place these 
courts in shape. More, it is necessary 
for those students who are members 
of the club and who wish to play, to 
come out and put some work on the 
courts. Suroly anybody who likes 
the game likes it enough to put in his 
"bit” of work towards * their up­
keep.
H. F. Simpson has been appointed 
supervisor of the courts for the re­
mainder of this year. He reports to 
the Tennis Club Committee. IBs 
duties are as the title states,, to super­
vise; that is, to see that iill rules and 
regulations are obeyed; to see that; 
only club members are allowed to 
play on the courts; and to aid in all 
ways possible in their upkeep, by 
working himself, and by supervising 
the work of others. What ho says 
will be backed up by the committee. 
Such is the only way to have it—to 
have a man placed over the tennis 
courts and when that man rpalces any 
ruling for him not to have any back­
ing is equivalent to having no man at 
all.
The supervisor of the courts cannot 
do all the work noccsBary for the up­
keep of the courts. Therefore it Is 
absolutoly necessary for (ho tennis 
men at Tech to como out and do their 
share towards I,ho upkeep. The courts 
aro at the present time in fair shapo 
and can be placed In best; Hlmpo only 
through the co-operation of the stud- 
onts.
The rules and regulations, together 
with a list of the club mombers will 
bo posted on the Tonnls Court Bulle­
tin board. Every mombor will pJoaao 
road those and make it a part of tholfc’ 
duty to obey and to soo that all otlior 
monibors oboy.

The ring committee held a meeting 
on Wednesday, the 13th, and had 
many designs Tor the ring submitted, 
which were discussed and picked to 
pieces. No definite action was taken 
as, to a selection, for it was felt 
among the members of the committee 
that none of the submitted designs 
were exactly suited to our needs.
After some discussion, one design 
was selected, which after some 
changes were made, to be brought up 
again for final action. This design will 
have a stone worked in it and it is 
felt that we are at last beginning to 
get some results, so that possibly by 
the next meeting of the committee 
the committee will have a/ring- to sub­
mit for the approval o£ the students 
and the alumni.
Definite progress and action of the 
committee will be recorded weekly in 
these columns. It will be well for the 
alumni to bear in mind that the ring 
we hope to recommend will not be a 
gorgeous affair, costing considerable, 
but one which will be commensurate 
with the pocketbooks of those inter­
ested in a moderately priced ring.

It is very important that all Clans 
send in at once to the Alumni Secre­
tary a coiTOct list of all members. 
This list will be used to check against 
our list in the office, which we are 
trying to correct and have ready for 
Campus Week. It is quite difficult for 
the Alumni Office to keep in touch 
\yith all of the alumni since so many 
are moving around from time to 
time. Therefore we ask all the Clans 
to co-operate and report changed ad­
dresses of members and addresses of 
new members.
Please send a revised list of your 
Clan members in at once.
