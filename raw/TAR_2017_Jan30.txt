In keeping with Carnegie 
Mellon University’s rich tra-
dition of excellence in robot-
ics, an independent institute 
founded by the university 
was awarded more than $250 
million in order to create a 
robotics manufacturing in-
stitute in Pittsburgh. This an-
nouncement was made by the 
Department of Defense (DoD) 
on Friday, Jan. 13.
The money is a mixture 
of public and private money, 
with $80 million coming from 
the DoD and an additional 
$173 million coming from 
partner organizations. The  
public-private Manufacturing 
USA institute was gifted to 
American Robotics, a Carn-
egie Mellon-led nonpro?t 
venture with more than 220 
partners in sectors all across 
the nation, including indus-
try, academia, government, 
and nonpro?t. The Richard 
King Mellon Foundation, a 
group dedicated to securing 
the future of South-western 
Pennsylvania, was instrumen-
tal in the process of creating 
the proposal.
This high-level award is a 
step that puts Carnegie Mel-
lon and Pittsburgh on the 
path to becoming a central 
part of technological advance-
ment in terms of manufactur-
ing, arti?cial intelligence, 
autonomy, and 3D printing. 
In order to be at the forefront 
of this new wave of emerging 
technologies, the generous 
donation will allow Ameri-
can Robots to make indus-
trial robotics more affordable 
for both big and small busi-
nesses. Furthermore, they 
will be adaptable to many 
uses, allowing companies to 
achieve more in less time, and 
at increased ef?ciency.
Many government of?cials 
predict that manufacturing 
on this scale will introduce a 
new generation, one in which 
the nation potentially experi-
ences an in?ux of new jobs 
and fueled economic growth, 
putting the U.S. squarely 
in the lead on advanced 
manufacturing.
“This new institute will 
provide signi?cant bene?ts 
to the region and the nation, 
while creating enormous op-
portunities for [Carnegie Mel-
lon] scholars and researchers, 
and new momentum for the 
university,” President Subra 
Suresh said in a university 
press release. “The institute, 
in return, will bene?t from 
[Carnegie Mellon]’s expertise 
in technology, as well as its 
strengths in policy, ethics, and 
human interfaces that will en-
sure that new technologies 
work to bene?t humankind.”
Among the several 
university faculty members 
who led the development 
and preparation of this insti-
tute was Gary Fedder, Carn-
egie Mellon’s vice provost 
for research as well as the 
Howard M. Wilkoff Professor 
of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering and a professor 
at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics 
Institute. He played a pivotal 
role in the establishment of 
the institute.
“When the DoD announced 
its intention to create a new 
institute dedicated to robotics 
manufacturing, we knew that 
[Carnegie Mellon]’s historic 
strength in the ?eld, leading 
to cutting-edge research un-
derway today, gave us a great 
opportunity,” said Fedder 
in a press release. “We were 
fortunate to build a team 
that brought complementary 
strengths from across the 
nation.”
One of Fedder’s partners 
on the project was Howie 
Choset, also a professor in 
the Robotics Institute. “This 
work has the power to bene?t 
society broadly, and to bene?t 
many, many potential work-
ers and their families,” said 
Choset. He believes that their 
mission had four prongs: em-
power American workers to 
compete with low-wage work-
ers abroad, create and sus-
tain new jobs to secure U.S. 
national prosperity, lower the 
technical, operational, and 
economic barriers for small-
medium sized enterprises as 
well as large companies to 
adopt robotics technologies, 
and assert U.S. leadership in 
advanced manufacturing.
Robots come with many 
challenges; they are expen-
sive, singularly purposed, 
challenging to reprogram, 
and require isolation from hu-
mans for our safety. However, 
the Advanced Robotics Manu-
facturing Institute (ARM) 
seeks to help make their ro-
bots safer, more affordable, 
and more useful.
“The institute will tap into 
Carnegie Mellon’s research 
strengths in collaborative 
robotics, sensor technologies, 
materials science and 
human-computer interac-
tion, areas that are rapidly 
transforming many sectors of 
our economy,” said Provost 
Farnam Jahanian. “With this 
unique partnership between 
academia, government, and 
industry, [Carnegie Mellon] 
is poised to bridge the gap 
between research, innova-
tion, and practice in the 
emerging ?eld of advanced 
manufacturing.”

On Jan. 24, Carnegie 
Mellon Student Senate 
and the Graduate Student 
Assembly organized a student 
forum to discuss the universi-
ty’s current academic policies 
regarding overloading cours-
es and its timeline for adding, 
dropping, and withdrawing 
from courses. Representa-
tives from Academic Poli-
cies and Practices (APP) 
discussed students’ main 
concerns regarding the cur-
rent academic practices, their 
general sentiments based 
on past surveys, the stress 
culture within the university, 
and changes proposed by 
the APP representatives of 
the Task Force, an organiza-
tion launched last spring by 
Provost Farnam Jahanian, 
psychology professor Mar-
lene Behrmann and Dean of 
Student Gina Casalegno to 
enhance the Carnegie Mellon 
experience.
Through the HealthU 
Survey conducted in 2013, 
APP representatives found 
that nearly half of the un-
dergraduate students at 
Carnegie Mellon identi?ed 
the quantity and dif?culty of 
academic work to be the main 
causes of stress. The APP 
Work Group argued that the 
current overloading policy, 
which automatically lifts the 
maximum credit limit for 
students with a QPA higher 
than 3.0, was shown to have 
fostered a toxic culture that 
pressures students to take 
on more courses than they 
can handle.
At the student forum, 
Annette Jacobson, the 
associate dean of the College 
of Engineering, proposed 
that Carnegie Mellon should 
remove this policy. “More 
stringent policies are needed 
to retain [the credit limit],” 
Jacobson said. Her proposal 
stated that students must ?rst 
consult their academic advi-
sors in order to overload and 
advisors should also present 
students with comprehensive 
plans for future courses. 
Moreover, ?rst-year under-
graduate and graduate stu-
dents would no longer be al-
lowed to overload, with the 
exception of double-major 
students and students pur-
suing dual degree or 2-3 
academic programs.
The overloading norm at 
Carnegie Mellon also leads 
to a higher course drop rate 
weeks into the semester. 
The current policy states 
that students have only two 
weeks to add courses, but ten 
weeks to drop a course and 
until the last day of classes 
Students share concerns on changing add/drop/withrawal course policies

Stephen E. Fienberg, 
Carnegie Mellon Professor 
of Statistics and Social Sci-
ence, passed away on Dec. 
14 at the age of 74.
Fienberg was a 
world-renowned statistician 
famous for creating cer-
tain statistical applications 
as a way to impact public 
policy and science. Some of 
the areas his work targeted 
were elements of human 
rights, forensics, survey 
procedures, census poll-
ing, and privacy standards. 
Additionally, Fienberg was 
voted into the National 
Academy of Sciences (NAS) 
in 1999 and developed 
methodological and theo-
retical progressions in both 
multivariate and algebraic 
statistics. Fienberg also pur-
sued his interests in other 
academic areas and spear-
headed machine learning at 
Carnegie Mellon.
“It was an incredible 
fortune to know and work 
with Steve Fienberg. He was 
the consummate academic 
who did it all — from ad-
ministrative work to teach-
ing and advising all while 
working to solve many of 
society’s grand challenges,” 
Richard Scheines, Dean of 
the Dietrich College of Hu-
manities and Social Scienc-
es said in a university press 
release. “Steve had preter-
natural energy, and he made 
everything he took on bet-
ter, including the Statistics 
Department, the National 
Academy of Sciences, the 
Machine Learning Depart-
ment, you name it. He was 
rightfully regarded by his 
CMU colleagues and his col-
laborators around the world 
as a world-class talent. He 
will be sorely missed.”
After coming to Carnegie 
Mellon in 1980 as a member 
of the Statistics Depart-
ment, Fienberg was also ap-
pointed positions in Heinz 
College, CyLab, and the Ma-
chine Learning Department. 
Fienberg was appointed 
head of the Statistics De-
partment from 1981 to 1984 
and was a key player in in-
corporating the Statistics 
Department with the Diet-
rich College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences. He was 
known for enlisting world-
class professors and held 
the position of dean of the 
college from 1987 to 1991. 
During his time as the Dean 
of Dietrich College, Fien-
berg founded the Modern 
Languages Department, 
which resulted in improving 
the college’s standing.
“For 36 years, Steve was 
one of Carnegie Mellon’s 
most valued citizens,” Pro-
vost Farnam Jahanian said. 
“A brilliant, nationally re-
nowned statistician and 
a thought leader on data-
sharing, he made a trans-
formative impact on the 
fields of social and behav-
ioral science and machine 
learning. As a teacher and 
leader, he was collabora-
tive, thoughtful and remark-
ably generous — a truly 
rare find. Steve has left an 
indelible mark on the insti-
tution and on the countless 
students, faculty and staff 
who were fortunate to work 
alongside him.”
For the National Academy 
of Sciences, over a course of 
more than 40 years, Fien-
berg was on 35 committees 
and panels that tackled 
subjects ranging from bi-
lingual education to census 
data. He also took part in 
the Standing Committee of 
Remembering the life and legacy ofProfessor Fienberg

Meditation could be the key to dealing with stress during the 2017 SuperbowlCMU ?u forecasting systems predict that ?u symptoms will peak in upcoming weeks
A group of computer 
scientists and statisticians 
at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity have predicted that flu 
activity may be reaching its 
peak for the 2016-2017 sea-
son. This was deduced from 
models created by the Stat 
and Delphi flu forecasting 
systems developed by the 
Delphi research group at 
Carnegie Mellon.
The Stat system creates 
its predictions by analyzing 
past flu patterns and 
current input from the CDC 
and Prevention’s domes-
tic influenza surveillance 
system. 
It predicts that flu 
activity for Pennsylvania, 
West Virginia, Delaware, 
Maryland, and Virginia will 
peak the week of Feb. 12, 
and flu activity nationwide 
will peak this week and 
next week.
The Delphi system uses 
best guesses which are 
made weekly by a group of 
people who receive input 
from the CDC’s surveillance 
network. 
It predicts that flu 
activity for Pennsylvania 
will peak the week of Jan. 
29 and will peak nationally 
the week of Feb. 5.
Compared to 11 
competing flu forecasting 
systems, both the Stat and 
Delphi flu forecasting sys-
tems proved to predict the 
most accurate forecasts for 
the 2015-2016 flu season. 
According to a Carnegie 
Mellon press release, mem-
bers of the Delphi research 
group expressed the hope 
that they will eventu-
ally be able to forecast 
flu activity the same way 
that meteorologists make 
weather forecasts.

DOMINIQUE ESCANDON
Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabi-
net Writer of The Student 
Government. 
Long breaks from school 
have always been marked by 
weeks of re?ection that turn, 
at least for me, into a need 
for action. I found myself 
thinking about Carnegie Mel-
lon (maybe way too much 
considering that this was 
supposed to be a time for re-
laxation) and what changes 
I would see within the next 
two and a half years. Having 
already spent three semes-
ters getting to know some of 
the most unique and driven 
people I’ve ever met, I grew 
anxious to see what this next 
semester would bring.
For this reason, it was 
incredible to return to our 
weekly Wednesday Cabi-
net meetings to hear about 
the Mental Health Advo-
cacy Open House that Eric 
Zhu, Student Government’s 
mental health representa-
tive, is organizing with the 
Provost’s Task Force. The 
Open House will take place 
on Monday, Feb. 20 from 6 
to 8 p.m. in Peter/Wright/
McKenna. The event is an op-
portunity for mental health 
advocacy organizations, such 
as Active Minds, Emerging 
Leaders, Counseling and 
Psychological Services, and 
University Healthy Services, 
to present their past work 
as well as their goals for 
the upcoming two semes-
ters. This is presented with 
a poster session and round-
table ideation discussions on 
provided topics.
The goal of this event 
is to improve communica-
tion and coordinate efforts 
among those on campus who 
work within mental health 
advocacy through informa-
tion and conversation. Again 
and again mental health has 
been pinpointed as one of 
the most pressing concerns 
at Carnegie Mellon, one that 
we can always be working 
harder on.
In establishing a poster 
template for all interested 
organizations, the informa-
tion exchange will be stream-
lined to bene?t both student 
leaders in mental health as 
well as general community 
members. By learning more 
about what events have al-
ready been done, or are being 
planned on campus, student 
leaders can ensure that their 
efforts in student wellness 
are maximized. For com-
munity members, this is an 
opportunity to ?nd out what 
aspects of Carnegie Mellon’s 
mental health action groups 
interest them the most.
My favorite part of this 
event is the conversation 
component. Incredibly 
impactful actions on campus 
have all sprung from the right 
people having the right con-
versations. With such a di-
verse, independent, and busy 
campus, it can be dif?cult to 
coordinate connections — by 
providing a central location 
for the cross-pollination of 
ideas, we can ensure that the 
vision of the Carnegie Mel-
lon of tomorrow is always 
innovative and empathetic.
I’m incredibly excited for 
everything that’s in store for 
this semester, and I believe 
that this Open House will set 
an important tradition that 
will catalyze action beyond 
what any of us might see dur-
ing our time here. If you feel 
there’s something Carnegie 
Mellon is missing in its men-
tal health discussions, want 
to join the action, or are even 
just interested in learning 
about what the Provost’s Task 
Force and other related orga-
nizations have accomplished 
to date, make sure to come 
by! And of course, for any 
other concerns or ideas you 
might have, you can always 
reach out to any member of 
Cabinet!
Those looking forward 
to next week’s Superbowl 
are probably all too familiar 
with the stress that comes 
along with the event, espe-
cially if your favorite team 
is competing. Carnegie Mel-
lon University scientists may 
have found the solution. 
They predict that if utilized 
during the games, mindful-
ness meditation can help 
improve stress management.
“If you get stressed out 
watching football or think 
that you might, set aside a 
little time before the game 
or during halftime doing 
brief mindfulness practic-
es,” David Creswell, associ-
ate professor of psychology 
in the Dietrich College of 
Humanities and Social Sci-
ences, said in a university 
press release.
Scientists believe that 
mindfulness meditation 
can also help relieve stress 
in our everyday lives. Cre-
swell found that mindful-
ness intervention programs 
are able to reduce loneliness 
in older adults, slow HIV 
progression, and even im-
prove healthy aging. This is 
because mindfulness medi-
tation training enhances 
brain stress resilience cir-
cuits and improves in?am-
matory health outcomes in 
high-stress adults.
“These brain changes 
provide a neurobiological 
marker for improved ex-
ecutive control and stress 
resilience, such that mind-
fulness meditation training 
improves your brain’s ability 
to help you manage stress,” 
Creswell said.
Hundreds of students ?ooded Wiegand Gymnasium on Wednesday, Jan. 25 to learn more about the various clubs and organizations at Carnegie Mellon. Organizations represented different sports, activities, and cultures.

EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
In June 2012, on the 30 
year anniversary of a Supreme 
Court case that banned states 
from charging undocument-
ed children tuition at pub-
lic schools, then-President 
Obama announced his sig-
nature immigration program 
known as the Deferred Ac-
tion for Childhood Arrivals 
program, or DACA.
DACA allows eligible 
undocumented immigrants 
who arrived in the United 
States as minors — often 
because they were brought 
here by their parents — to ap-
ply for a renewable two-year 
deferral of deportation pro-
ceedings, to apply for a work 
permit, and in some states, to 
receive certain government 
bene?ts such as in-state tu-
ition at public colleges or the 
ability to apply for a driver’s 
license. However, it does not 
provide legal status or a path 
to citizenship — it only allows 
some undocumented people 
to come out of the shadows 
and temporarily live without 
fear of deportation.
To be eligible for the DACA 
program, an immigrant must 
have arrived before the age 
of 16 and before June 2007, 
be enrolled in school, have 
a high school diploma, or be 
honorably discharged from 
the military, be younger than 
31, and not pose a threat to 
national security (i.e., no 
felony or signi?cant misde-
meanor convictions and few-
er than three misdemeanor 
convictions).
Republicans during the 
Obama presidency have tried 
to defund DACA because 
they believe it is executive 
overreach, but in practice 
this is dif?cult to do since 
the application fees form the 
bulk of DACA funds. Now, 
with President Trump’s in-
auguration and Republicans 
controlling both branches of 
Congress, the DACA program 
faces a signi?cant risk of be-
ing repealed. Many on the 
program, known as DREAM-
ers, named after a different 
immigration program that 
grants conditional and per-
manent residency to undocu-
mented immigrants on cer-
tain conditions, are worried 
that under President Trump, 
they will be deported from 
the only home many of them 
have ever known.
In the months since the 
election, the presidents of 
over 550 colleges and uni-
versities across the U.S. have 
collectively signed an open 
letter in support of DACA, 
including Carnegie Mellon 
President Subra Suresh.
“Since the advent of the 
Deferred Action for Child-
hood Arrivals (DACA) pro-
gram in 2012, we have seen 
the critical bene?ts of this 
program for our students, and 
the highly positive impacts on 
our institutions and commu-
nities”, the letter declares. 
It further argues that many 
DREAMers have actively and 
positively contributed to both 
campus communities and 
wider society, and that they 
are the “best of America.” 
“This is both a moral impera-
tive and a national necessity,” 
the letter states.
While we do not yet know 
how President Trump and the 
Republican-controlled Con-
gress will change DACA or 
whether the program would 
be ended, or what will happen 
to the DREAMers if the pro-
gram ends, Carnegie Mellon’s 
press release states that “[as] 
an international community 
of scholars, [Carnegie Mel-
lon] will continue to do all 
it can to support students, 
faculty, and staff, including 
those who are most vulnera-
ble, consistent with local and 
federal laws.” Meanwhile, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Division 
of Student Affairs and Of?ce 
of General Counsel have con-
ducted meetings with various 
student groups to hear their 
questions and concerns about 
this issue and to take these 
voices into account while 
creating university policy.
More details will be 
published as the current 
administration unfolds and 
related university policy is 
developed.
Trump administration seeks to repeal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals 
Reviewing Professor Fienberg’s legacy
to withdraw. This policy 
not only creates vacancies 
in the classroom, but also 
prevents interested students 
from taking certain courses. 
Moreover, the late drop and 
withdraw deadlines perpetu-
ate students’ suffering in 
these courses, creating more 
stress and negatively in?u-
encing their performance in 
other courses.
In order to reduce stress 
and ensure an even distribu-
tion of opportunities, the APP 
Work Group proposed two 
new plans based on study-
ing peer institutions such as 
Cornell University and Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. Both 
plans involve moving the 
withdraw deadline from the 
end of the semester to 10 to 
11 weeks into the semester 
which will allow students to 
concentrate on improving on 
other courses.
The Concurrent Model 
allows students up to two 
weeks to add or drop a 
course. By expediting the 
process of dropping courses, 
more opportunities can be 
made available to wait-listed 
students. However, some stu-
dents argued that two weeks 
of time is not suf?cient for 
students to make an informed 
decision about a course. This 
will result in more students 
resorting to withdrawing 
which will negatively impact 
their transcripts. The Sepa-
rate Model moves the drop 
deadline to the ?fth week. 
It allows more time for stu-
dents to consider dropping 
a course, but still creates 
vacancy in the classrooms.
Both models bene?t 
students in courses that 
require more teamwork. 
This is because many proj-
ects suffer from the loss of 
group members towards 
the end of the semesters, 
and the remaining members 
become more stressed due 
to the leftover work of the 
missing members. Carnegie 
Mellon will work on chang-
ing the stigma of receiv-
ing a “W” on the transcript 
by communicating with 
employers.
However, many students 
argue that the current policy 
is the least stressful. Since 
students often don’t receive 
indicative feedback on their 
grades in the ?rst few weeks, 
having a drop deadline ear-
lier than mid semester would 
only conduct more stress 
later on when they could no 
longer drop the course with-
out facing consequences. 
Some argued that if profes-
sors are not limited by poli-
cies and have the freedom 
to add enthusiastic students 
to their courses, opportuni-
ties can be evenly distrib-
uted. During the feedback 
section of the forum, some 
students suggested that 
Carnegie Mellon should ap-
ply its conversion to pass/fail 
model at a larger scale which 
would allow students who 
passed the course to satisfy 
the requirement but receive 
no credit.
Another forum dealing 
with the same issue was 
held for faculty members on 
Jan. 25. The policies in the 
proposal are not ?nal, and 
APP will continue to debate 
between these options.
APP of?cials propose alternative add/drop academic policies  
the American Opportunity 
Study, whose goal is to exam-
ine data from the U.S. census 
to investigate individuals’ and 
families’ trends. Additionally, 
Fienberg, being an expert in 
forensics, served on the Na-
tional Commission of Forensic 
Science as the only statistician.
Fienberg had many 
accomplishments and was rec-
ognized many times through-
out his career. He oversaw 43 
Ph.D. students and held nu-
merous honors: the 1982 Com-
mittee of Presidents of Statisti-
cal Society President’s Award 
for Outstanding Statistician 
Under the Age of 40, the 2002 
ASA Samuel S. Wilks Award 
for his distinguished career 
in statistics, the ?rst Statisti-
cal Society of Canada’s Lise 
Manchester Award in 2008 to 
recognize excellence in state-
of-the-art statistical work on 
problems of public interest, the 
2015 National Institute of Sta-

Betsy DeVos’ lack of experience puts schools at risk
ZACHARY GOLDSTEIN
Staffwriter
The Academic Policies and Prac-
tices (APP) Working Group of the 
Task Force on the CMU Experience 
recently proposed new policies re-
garding overloading on units and 
course dropping/withdrawal dead-
lines. The policies, despite being 
well-intentioned efforts to improve 
student wellness, would have harm-
ful effects on the student body.
One aspect of the proposal con-
cerns overloading, the practice of 
taking more units worth of courses 
than is standard in a semester. Cur-
rently, ?rst-year students are not 
permitted to overload in the fall 
semester. This is a sensible policy 
aimed at ensuring that students ad-
just to Carnegie Mellon life and get 
a sense of how much work they can 
handle before overloading.
The Working Group’s proposal 
would extend this restriction to the 
spring semester, which would un-
necessarily limit students’ ?exibil-
ity. Many ?rst-year students ?nd it 
bene?cial to overload in the spring 
semester, and the rationale prevent-
ing them from overloading in the 
fall does not apply to a complete ban 
on overloading during a student’s 
second semester at Carnegie Mel-
lon. If this policy is enacted anyway, 
it would be a generous consolation 
for the administration to consider 
allowing students to use AP or IB 
credit to place out of Interpretation 
and Argument, the ?rst-year writing 
course required across the univer-
sity. At least then, many ?rst-year 
students who previously would have 
overloaded in order to take an extra 
course would still be able to take 
that course by doing so in place of 
Interpretation and Argument.
The most troubling aspect of 
the proposal consists of moving 
the deadlines for dropping and 
withdrawing from a course several 
weeks earlier. The proposal suggests 
two models of changing deadlines 
which both aim to get students to 
leave courses earlier in the semester 
rather than later, but it is possible 
that the policy would achieve the op-
posite of its intended goal. A student 
might remain in the course for an 
entire semester rather than leaving 
after the ?rst midterm either out of 
concern for getting a “W” for with-
drawal on the student’s transcript, 
or because the withdrawal deadline, 
currently at the very end of the se-
mester, might have passed and the 
student would have no choice but to 
remain in the class.
The proposed policy limits stu-
dents’ ?exibility and paternalisti-
cally suggests that students cannot 
make good decisions about when to 
leave a course. Ironically, the policy 
would make it even harder for stu-
dents to make informed decisions 
about dropping a course, because 
they would not be able to spend as 
much time in the course and will 
not be able to receive individualized 
feedback (such as exam results) be-
fore the drop deadline.
The proposal suggests that regis-
tering for one too many classes and 
dropping your least-favorite class 
during the semester should be dis-
couraged. However, this is actually 
an effective way to maximize the 
quality of one’s classes, which in 
turn rewards professors with hap-
pier, more engaged students. There-
fore, the administration should be 
trying to promote policies that em-
power students to make informed 
decisions about how they spend 
their time.
The idea that limiting choices 
can be bene?cial does have some ba-
sis in social science, but a kinder and 
more freedom-preserving approach 
would be to “nudge” students to-
ward choices that promote wellness 
rather than forcing restrictive poli-
cies on them. One of the proposed 
changes, making students jump 
through hoops before overloading 
by getting approval from their as-
sociate dean, follows this idea. The 
majority of the proposals, however, 
do not.
There’s another aspect of the pro-
posal that utilizes manipulative be-
havioral science to attempt to gain 
support for this policy. By offering 
two models, one moderately more 
restrictive than the status quo and 
the other far more restrictive than 
the status quo, the Working Group 
has (either intentionally or acci-
dentally) framed the moderately re-
strictive proposal as a sensible com-
promise choice, when in fact both 
policies would signi?cantly reduce 
students’ ?exibility.
Similarly, in a proposal that takes 
advantage of the well-documented 
social science principle that people 
are in?uenced by peer pressure, the 
white paper states that several of 
our peer institutions have more re-
strictive policies than Carnegie Mel-
lon. But why should we at Carnegie 
Mellon adopt inferior policies just 
because other schools do? Instead, 
Carnegie Mellon should continue 
to be a leader when it comes to re-
specting students’ decision-making 
abilities.
The current state of affairs does 
not force any student to overload or 
to stay in a course they do not like 
for many weeks. Current policies 
simply allow students to challenge 
themselves by overloading or by tak-
ing a more dif?cult class with the 
knowledge that it is possible to drop 
it without consequences within a 
period of ten weeks. Carnegie Mel-
lon ought to trust students to know 
what is best for themselves rather 
than impose paternalistic policies 
that restrict their choices.

Of all of Donald Trump’s contro-
versial Cabinet picks, Betsy DeVos, 
his choice for Secretary of Educa-
tion, has received a considerable 
— and much warranted — amount 
of criticism. DeVos is not an educa-
tor, nor does she have experience 
managing money or even applying 
for student loans — what she has 
done is substantial lobbying, mostly 
on behalf of charter schools. Apart 
from that targeted interaction with 
education, she has virtually no quali-
?cations and gives us no reason to 
expect she will be able to manage the 
position competently.
Among the few who have re-
acted positively to DeVos are 
pro-school-choice groups, simply 
because of her stance on charter 
schools — they look forward to hav-
ing plenty of options when the time 
comes to choose a school for their 
children. If her efforts anywhere 
near resemble what she has already 
done in Michigan, however, they will 
sacri?ce quality in exchange.
Thanks to DeVos’ efforts, char-
ter schools abound in Detroit — but 
their test scores continue to rank 
among the lowest in the state even 
as their superintendents make as 
much as $130,000 a year and opera-
tors are allowed to expand overseas. 
According to The New York Times, it 
is not unheard of for only 10 percent 
of high school seniors from these 
schools to score “college ready” on 
reading tests.
Another downside to DeVos’ 
championed system is the fact 
that, when less-than-satisfactory 
charter schools increase in num-
ber and students enrolled, public 
schools get less funding by the very 
nature of the relationship between 
the two. Public schools pay to send 
children in their districts to char-
ter schools, while still providing 
transportation themselves. Some 
charter schools don’t provide free or 
reduced lunches to children in need. 
And charter schools, unlike public 
schools, can refuse students they 
don’t feel should be a part of their 
student body.
“The president’s decision to ask 
Betsy DeVos to run the Department 
of Education should offend every 
single American man, woman, and 
child who has bene?tted from the 
public education system in this 
country,” Senate Minority Leader 
Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a 
statement. “Public education has 
lifted millions out of poverty, has put 
millions in good paying jobs, and has 
been the launching pad for people 
who went on to cure disease and to 
create inventions that have changed 
our society for the better.”
Schumer plans to vote against De-
Vos at the con?rmation hearing.
Another glimpse of DeVos’ inex-
perience came during her Senate 
hearing, when she was unable to 
distinguish between “pro?ciency” 
and “growth.” While some schools, 
which measure pro?ciency, evalu-
ate their students based on a single 
benchmark that everyone is expect-
ed to reach, others measure growth, 
or how much children improve their 
own individual performance. This is 
an important distinction for the Sec-
retary of Education to understand 
and develop a position on, as the de-
bate determines which schools could 
be closed for poor performance.
Of course, DeVos also suggested 
that guns might be needed in schools 
to fend off grizzly bears, so perhaps 
this lack of understanding is simply 
the tip of the iceberg.
Especially concerning for us at 
Carnegie Mellon is the fact that, 
if con?rmed, DeVos would be in 
charge of running a $1 trillion stu-
dent loan bank, despite having no 
experience managing anywhere 
near that amount of money. She has 
no concrete plans to ensure tax mon-
ey does not contribute to fraud and 
abuse, beyond delegating it to oth-
ers in her department. She further 
refused to commit to enforcing the 
rules already in place to oversee col-
leges receiving federal funds with-
out further review.
In addition, she’s never even had 
to apply for ?nancial aid for herself 
or her children, so we can’t expect 
her to have any understanding of or 
empathy for the process.
DeVos has also said some wor-
rying statements regarding sexual 
assault on campus. She refused to 
commit to upholding the 2011 Title 
IX, an anti-discrimination law which 
prohibits sexual assault as a form of 
sexual harassment on campus. This 
has left many concerned over the at-
titude the Department of Education 
would take regarding sexual assault 
under DeVos.
Furthermore, though DeVos 
has since attempted to change her 
stance, she did waver on whether 
she would enforce the Individu-
als with Disabilities Act during the 
hearing. At one point, she said she 
felt it should be up to the states 
to decide — despite being a federal 
law to ensure that all students’ rights 
are protected, and that parents have 
a say in their disabled children’s edu-
cation.
DeVos was also questioned over 
donations her family has made to 
the Republican Party amounting to 
around $200 million, and Senator 
Bernie Sanders (I-VT) asked her if 
she was chosen purely for this rea-
son. And though she has resigned 
from a dozen foundations, including 
All Children Matter and Great Lakes 
Education Foundation, and plans to 
divest from 102 companies within 90 
days of being con?rmed, she would 
remain a co-trustee of three fam-
ily trusts that could keep her tied to 
educational organizations like for-
pro?t colleges.
The way DeVos’ hearing was run 
was equally as concerning as her 
conception of the realities of school-
ing in America. During the hearing, 
each senator had only ?ve minutes 
to question DeVos, and they were not 
permitted a second round of ques-
tioning, despite precedents in which 
they had been granted more time .
Senator Lemar Alexander (R-TN) 
did say that Senators could ques-
tion DeVos in their of?ces at another 
time, but the public could not watch 
these meetings the way they were 
able to see the hearing.
Furthermore, DeVos’ completed 
ethics review was not made avail-
able until after the hearing, making 
it impossible for senators to address 
content they found within the docu-
ment publicly.
In an even more worrying move, 
the White House has yet to reconnect 
the phone lines following Trump’s 
inauguration, so callers concerned 
about DeVos are not being heard. A 
voice mail recommends that callers 
instead turn to Facebook or email 
to voice their opinion, but studies 
have shown that calling is far more 
effective. While people can still call 
senators’ and representatives’ of?ces 
directly, there’s something about be-
ing cut off from the White House it-
self that somehow suggests a lack of 
a voice in the matter.
In the end, though a second hear-
ing has not been granted, the vote 
on DeVos’ hearing was postponed 
until Jan. 31 to give lawmakers time 
to question her ?nancial disclosures 
and positions individually. For the 
sake of students everywhere, we 
can only hope that some will change 
their minds based on what they hear 
and what their constituents say.

The day after President Trump 
took of?ce, women in Washington, 
D.C. and across the globe marched 
for women’s rights. President Trump 
walked in on his ?rst of?cial week-
day as President, took in the Oval 
Of?ce, sat down in his comfy leather 
chair, and picked up his pen. He sur-
rounded himself with seven other 
men, and with cameras ?ashing and 
reporters shouting questions, he 
used his pen as a weapon to strike 
women where it hurts the most — 
health care. He loudly reinstated the 
Mexico City Policy, or the “global 
gag rule,” which is detrimental to 
women’s health care in develop-
ing countries and violates the First 
Amendment right to the freedom of 
speech.
The global gag rule prohib-
its organizations from providing 
abortion-related information to pa-
tients, providing testimony or advo-
cating for the legalization of abor-
tion in countries where it is illegal, 
providing referrals to other organi-
zations who can perform legal abor-
tions, and providing legal abortions.
The organizations affected by 
this policy are those who provide 
family planning services, from con-
traceptives to maternal checkups 
and, in countries where it is legal, 
abortions. These organizations, un-
der the Helm’s Amendment of 1973 
are already prohibited from using 
federal aid to fund abortions.
The global gag rule affects only 
international non-governmental 
organizations. It was ?rst intro-
duced in an executive order by Pres-
ident Reagan, undone by President 
Clinton, reinstated by President W. 
Bush, repealed by President Obama, 
and now reinstated by President 
Trump.
The installation of the global gag 
rule will have disastrous impacts 
on the health of women in develop-
ing countries. Most organizations 
choose not to obey the global gag 
rule — and lose federal funding — 
as they see the effects of not being 
able to provide and discuss abor-
tions far worse than the negative 
consequences that follow losing fed-
eral funding.
Not allowing these organizations 
to discuss abortions does not pro-
vide the proper health care women 
deserve. At a time when a woman 
dies from preventable causes relat-
ed to pregnancy and childbirth ev-
ery two minutes with 99 percent of 
these deaths occurring in develop-
ing countries, according to statistics 
from the World Health Organiza-
tion, access to proper prenatal care 
has never been more important.
Research from NARAL Pro-
Choice America has demonstrated 
that the global gag rule forces 
organizations who reject the policy 
to close clinics and raise fees at the 
clinics that remain open. These 
organizations also have far fewer 
contraceptives at their disposal, in-
creasing the number of unwanted 
pregnancies. Further research from 
Population Action International has 
shown that under the global gag 
rule, more women lose health care, 
bear unwanted pregnancies, die, or 
become disabled due to unsafe abor-
tions. Adolescents are “especially 
vulnerable to sexual abuse and their 
pregnancies often result from forced 
sex, rape or incest” as stated in the 
Women and Health Learning Pack-
age: Unsafe Abortions and Unwant-
ed Pregnancy.
The mass majority of Americans, 
about 81 percent, believe abortions 
should be legal in a few cases, typi-
cally in rape, incest, or health of the 
mother. They should be appalled 
that their government does not even 
allow for discussion with clients 
about abortion in foreign countries 
where it is legal, or advocacy for the 
legalization of abortion in countries 
where it is illegal.
The global gag rule goes farther 
than just closing clinics and raising 
costs: It actually violates the First 
Amendment. The First Amend-
ment states “Congress shall make 
no law... abridging the freedom of 
speech,” and while executive orders 
are issued by the President, they 
are regarding how to enforce laws 
passed by Congress, therefore bind-
ing them to the First Amendment. 
Not allowing members of these or-
ganizations to even advocate for 
legal abortions abroad is clearly a 
violation of the First Amendment. 
According to case precedent in the 
United States, the global gag rule 
would be found unconstitutional in 
court if it applied to organizations 
that operated within the United 
States. Censoring information and 
not allowing members of non-gov-
ernmental organizations that help 
with international family planning 
to advocate for legal abortion in oth-
er countries also contradicts Ameri-
can policies that support women’s 
rights and empowerment abroad.
Sean Spicer, the current Press 
Secretary of the United States, stated 
in a press conference last Monday, 
“I think the reinstatement of this 
[Mexico City] policy...ensures that 
we’re standing up not just for the life 
of the unborn, but for also taxpayer 
funds that are being spent overseas 
to perform an action that is contrary 
to the president.” But, as previously 
stated, the money already wasn’t 
going to fund abortions. The Consti-
tution clearly states that the role of 
the presidency is to execute the laws 
and Supreme Court decisions, even 
if these are “contrary to the presi-
dent” and his political agenda.
Women’s health care should be 
more than a political tennis match. 
The global gag rule should not be 
volleyed between presidents in a re-
instated and revoked game. Trump’s 
reinstating of the global gag rule 
highlights that women’s health care 
will not remain a priority or even 
a concern the next four years. The 
Women’s March on Washington 
could not have planned for more 
perfect timing, and the time for 
women’s health advocates is now.

Jan. 21, 2017 is marked in the cal-
endar as the day when the “power” 
and the “pink rebel” challenged each 
other. While the power refers to Don-
ald Trump’s Inauguration ceremony 
as the 45th President of USA, the 
‘pink rebel’ points to the Women’s 
March that was the largest one-day 
protest in US history.
I call the Women’s March the 
“pink rebel” because of the symbolic 
pink hats that the majority of the 
people wore that day. The pink hats 
are aptly called “p**** hats” and 
were manufactured under the Pussy-
hat project to denote solidarity and 
unity among the protesters.
Reports suggest that at least 3.3 
million people across the United 
States took part in the protest. When 
it comes to Washington, D.C., the 
source city for the event, the crowd 
count soared to more than half a mil-
lion — almost three times greater 
than the President’s Inaugural cer-
emony! Well, you just need basic 
math here to measure the success of 
the events. If there is one thing that 
I have observed in these days, it is 
this: The citizens of the country are 
at unrest. Women, workers, immi-
grants, LGBTQ, and environmental-
ists — everyone who makes our so-
ciety diverse and uni?ed at the same 
time — now feel insecure about their 
rights.
Many people did lose faith after 
the United States’ election results, 
and the Women’s March was their 
beacon of hope. The pink rebel 
brought together people from across 
the world to unite for a cause — to 
stand and ?ght for your rights! And 
by “your” I don’t just mean women, 
but anyone who felt deprived and 
forbidden of what is theirs. So that 
day when millions of women pro-
tested, a little ?re ignited in me, too. 
I thought, “How often do we see 
a march led by a community that 
stands not just for itself but for all? 
That is so rare!” I could see the im-
mense strength that the pink rebel 
bore to stand against the current 
government and to voice its opinion. 
But as I started building my castles 
of bright future, I came across vari-
ous articles and news that showed 
women of color were annoyed at the 
event.
They alleged white women to be 
?ghting for their own cause and also 
reminding the masses that white 
women voted for Trump! According 
to Vox, 53 percent of white women 
voted for Trump and according to 
CNN only 7 percent of black women 
and 25 percent of Latino women vot-
ed for him.
And I was back to square one 
again. My little ?ame of hope started 
to ?icker and I sighed in despair. I 
could easily see a tension emerging. 
I pondered, “How does the skin color 
or a person’s vote preference defy the 
fact that we are a community ?rst 
and an individual later?”
If almost half of the women voted 
for the President, there is a consider-
able half that did not. Why blame the 
community for what half of the white 
women did? Are we not grown-ups 
and mature enough to live with the 
reality of the inauguration? After all, 
we cannot play the blame game for-
ever!
A woman from North Carolina 
shared her experience as a protester 
who carried a sign, White Women 
Elected Trump. In her article, she 
quotes the comments of passersby as 
she walked in the protest. According 
to the writer, she received high-?ves 
and ‘thank you’s from black women 
and Latinos and frowns from young-
er white women. Many of the older 
white women made angry rejections 
claiming that they didn’t vote for 
Trump, they voted for Hillary Clin-
ton. The writer said that the whole 
idea of the sign was to make people 
uncomfortable as it also made her 
uncomfortable. Moreover, she says 
that it’s time that white women own 
what the statistics tell and continue 
their ?ght for different causes. In her 
opinion, the mere idea of acceptance 
sends a strong message to different 
women communities — a message 
that white women stand united with 
black, brown, trans or queer women.
Every successful event has some 
shortcomings but the Women’s 
March proved to be powerful even 
after plenty of criticisms. When 
millions of rebels join together in a 
peaceful protest, it does not remain a 
protest anymore. It becomes a revo-
lution — a change! The rest we can 
hope is for the government to look 
after us and our rights. And just so 
the government does not forget the 
pink rebels, there is another peace-
ful protest rising called The First 100 
Days of Resistance. Its goal is to show 
resistance against the government’s 
destructive agenda in the next 100 
days.
The government must be for the 
people, of the people and by the 
people. Let us just hope that nobody 
forgets that!

Rock music is rebellion. It is a re-
volt against power, authority, and so-
cial norms. For most bands, their bat-
tle takes place on the stage, but for 
the all Asian-American rock group 
The Slants, their dissonant de?ance 
takes place in the Supreme Court.
These social justice musicians, 
in a mix of artistic de?ance and dry 
humor, branded themselves with the 
most hackneyed stereotype in Asian-
American culture: slanted eyes. 
When Simon Tam, a bass guitarist, 
founded the group in 2006, he was 
tired of being the “token Asian” in 
every band. Tam told the Washington 
Post that when he was putting togeth-
er the ?rst Asian-American band, he 
asked his friends what they think all 
Asians have in common.
“The ?rst thing they said: All 
Asians have slanted eyes,” Tam said. 
“I thought, ‘That’s interesting.’ Num-
ber one, because it’s not even true. 
But then I thought, I could call it The 
Slants. It would be this play on words 
— because we could talk about our 
slant on life, what it’s like to be peo-
ple of color, to be Asian American.”
However, when Tam applied for a 
patent, which is a necessity for every 
band, the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Of?ce rejected their application on 
the grounds that the term “slants” 
is disparaging to Asian-Americans. 
True to the de?ant creed of rock, they 
fought back, and now, after a seven-
year legal battle, The Slants are ?-
nally appearing before the Supreme 
Court.
This audacious practice — to 
take a slur against oneself and make 
it one’s own — has been in practice 
long before The Slants made their 
own ironic, incendiary transforma-
tion. It is the center of much intense 
debate among many artists and racial 
groups, and many who oppose The 
Slants do so because they’re afraid 
that it could lead to the sanction of 
other, much more hateful speech, 
such as the n-word. Others, however, 
support the band’s desire to take 
ownership of the “language of op-
pression” and use it “until the words 
can’t hurt us again,” as they declare 
in their new EP, The Band Who Must 
Not Be Named.
However, the Supreme Court 
judges constitutionality, not by clever 
invectives or Harry Potter references, 
and so they are evaluating this case 
for what it fundamentally is: a free-
dom of speech issue. What many 
don’t realize is that the First Amend-
ment protects even “hate speech,” 
which means that whether the word 
“slants” is considered offensive or 
not, it is private, protected speech. 
This is the full power of words in 
America — the government can-
not restrict speech based on their 
own agenda or others’ opinions. The 
Slants have the constitutional right to 
use their name to comment on race 
or politics or society, as musicians 
have been doing since the birth 
of rock’n’roll. Yet, after the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Of?ce 
rejected their application, it 
accepted that of another group 
with the same name. This al-
ternate group didn’t have any 
Asian members, and so their 
name wasn’t considered of-
fensive to Asian-Americans. 
The irony is astounding.
From rappers to foot-
ball coaches, all in?am-
matory speakers await 
the court’s momentous 
decision, which may 
expand or contract the 
limits of free speech in 
many controversial cases, 
such as that of the Red-
skins football team and 
their painfully banal Na-
tive American parody. 
The Slants are less 
than thrilled to be as-
sociated with other, 
more offensive groups, as Tam as-
serts: “Our case is not the ?oodgate 
for hate speech in this country.”
While it won’t be a “?oodgate,” 
this ruling will undoubtedly clarify 
the true freedom of ‘free speech,’ and 
solidify the constitutional rights of 
all Americans, Asian or otherwise. 
The Supreme Court has entertained 
many eccentric guests in its court-
room, but this Asian-American 
dance-rock band will be a ground-
breaking addition. And, hopefully, 
their verdict will be one as well.

New species of extinct giant otter found in China
Scientists have described a 
prehistoric otter species that 
was “two to three times larger 
than any modern otter,” ac-
cording to paleontologist De-
nise Su.
Siamogale melilutra lived 
six million years ago in what 
is now the Yunnan province 
of China and, according to 
the scientists who originally 
discovered it, would have 
weighed over one hundred 
pounds.
The researchers studied a 
fossilized cranium found in a 
mine in 2010 and came to the 
conclusion that it belonged a 
previously undiscovered ot-
ter species, based on a digital 
reconstruction and analysis of 
its skull structure. They also 
believe that some previously 
unclassi?ed fossils found in 
2009 are S. melilutra speci-
mens as well.
The ?ndings were pub-
lished this week in the Journal 
of Systematic Palaeontology.

NASA lanches new project to study cause of auroras
A NASA campaign launch-
ing this month aims to learn 
more about Earth’s magnetic 
?eld through auroras, the 
stunning polar light effects at 
occur at the Earth’s poles.
The ?rst mission, named 
PolarNOx, will study the af-
ter effects of the aurora while 
avoiding interaction with 
the aurora itself. It will focus 
on collecting data on atmo-
spheric nitrous oxide, a gas 
produced by auroras. The Po-
larNOx rocket launch window 
closes Jan. 31.
The second and third mis-
sions will use two rockets each. 
Neutral jets — jets that do not 
interact with the ionosphere 
— in Auroral Arcs will deter-
mine the relationship between 
auroras and ionospheric elec-
trical ?elds. The ISINGLASS 
sounding rocket will ?re its 
identical rockets into two dif-
ferent auroras and investigate 
how they are affected by the 
solar wind. The entire project 
will be completed this March.

Research explains prehistoric Martian climate change
Though Mars is a notori-
ously dry planet, its surface 
contains evidence that it was 
once covered with liquid wa-
ter — an established fact in 
the scienti?c community. 
However, it is unknown what 
prehistoric climate conditions 
caused Mars to become warm 
enough for liquid water to ex-
ist; the planet’s atmosphere 
lacks enough greenhouse 
gases to produce a greenhouse 
effect.
Environmental scientists 
published a proposal this 
week that may be the ?rst to 
successfully explain this cli-
mate change, using a prin-
ciple called collision-induced 
absorption. They claim that 
while there may not have 
been enough individual gas 
molecules present to create 
a greenhouse effect on their 
own, the interaction between 
these molecules creates a sig-
ni?cant amount of heat reten-
tion — enough to warm the 
planet.

Distracted drivers much have lower response times
A study published this 
week in the journal Human 
Factors found that drivers in 
automated cars have a wide 
range of response times.
The study engaged 26 
adults in a simulation with 
normal driving conditions in 
an autonomous vehicle. Driv-
ers were asked to perform a 
distracting secondary task 
and, at random intervals, they 
were requested to switch ei-
ther from manual to automat-
ic or vice versa. The response 
times ranged from 1.9 seconds 
to 25.7 seconds; distracted 
drivers had slower response 
times, on average.
The authors of the study 
believe their ?ndings have im-
plications for both road safety 
and the auto-engineering in-
dustry, as vehicle designers try 
to improve the safety features 
of their imminently commer-
cial self-driving cars.

Female scientists usually excluded from peer review
An analysis of the age and 
gender data of over 100,000 
scientists revealed that wom-
en are less likely to be asked to 
review publications, as com-
pared to their male peers.
The data, collected from 
American Geophysical Union 
journal articles, showed that 
even though female authors 
are more likely to be accepted 
for publication, only 20 per-
cent of reviewers are female 
— less than the expected pro-
portion, based on the number 
of women in the AGU.
The authors of the review 
note that the bias is present 
across all age groups, thus 
“the lower participation by 
women as reviewers is not just 
because editors were seeking 
more-senior reviewers, who 
are predominantly male.”
Female scientists also face 
bias in award and grant deci-
sions, conference invitations, 
and hiring and promotions.

Extended periods in space may affect genes and cells
The preliminary data from 
NASA’s ground-breaking 
“twin study” suggest that long 
periods spent in space may al-
ter the human body.
In the study, astronaut 
Scott Kelly spent 342 days 
in orbit on the International 
Space Station while his iden-
tical twin Mark remained on 
Earth. Various biological mea-
surements of both brothers 
were taken before, during and 
after Kelly’s year in space.
Kelly experienced atypical-
ly large ?uctuations in gene-
expression signatures, possi-
bly due to the stress of living 
in orbit. His genes also showed 
signs of decreased methyla-
tion. These effects and their 
consequences are still being 
studied. However, because the 
study involves sequencing the 
entire genome of both twins, 
the complete results may nev-
er be published due to privacy 
concerns.

The Wilton E. Scott 
Institute for Energy 
Innovation is ramping up for 
its second-ever Energy Week 
— a program “designed to 
educate, inform, and debate 
energy policy, highlight re-
search and innovation, and 
prepare for the future,” ac-
cording to its website. Ener-
gy Week will begin on March 
27 and end on March 31.
Each day of Energy Week 
is themed to emphasize the 
many caveats of discussions 
concerning energy. Monday 
is dedicated to the future 
of energy, whereas Tuesday, 
Wednesday, Thursday, and 
Friday are focused on inno-
vation, research, policy, and 
education, respectively; this 
allows individuals to attend 
events dedicated to the as-
pect of energy they are inter-
ested in. The copious activi-
ties of the week range from 
over 40 talks with influen-
tial innovators in the field, 
such as Tesla Motors’ Chief 
Technology Officer (CTO) 
JB Straubel, to an energy 
industry-oriented career fair 
open to all students, trips to 
nearby energy production 
sites, and three engaging 
student competitions.
The dramatic monologue 
competition is a crowd-
favorite. Engaging the uni-
versity’s arts, the competi-
tion “is open to [Carnegie 
Mellon] drama students who 
are interested in showing 
how dramatic words can 
communicate the concept 
of energy,” as is stated on 
www.CMUEnergyWeek.org.
“The goal of 
Energy Week is 
to highlight all 
our different 
energy 
activities 
around the 
campus.”
— Deborah Stine
Professor of 
Engineering and 
Public Policy 
Despite several other 
simultaneous events 
which occurred during 
the dramatic monologue 
competition at last year’s 
Energy Week, Power Source 
asserted “none could ri-
val the theater,” referring 
to drama student Andrew 
Richardson’s skit depicting 
innovator Nicola Tesla and 
his financier J.P. Morgan.
Engineering and Pub-
lic Policy professor Debo-
rah Stine, who organizes 
Energy Week, views it as a 
chance “to highlight all our 
different energy activities 
around the campus,” as she 
mentioned in an interview 
with The Tartan. 
Although, the Carnegie 
Mellon School of Computer 
Science’s breakthroughs 
are widely acclaimed and 
popularized, the university 
also pioneers in the energy 
field, developing cutting-
edge and sustainable tech-
nology, such as edible 
electronics. 
Professor Stine believes 
Carnegie Mellon “is just as 
active in energy and has a 
lot of leaders in the field, but 
[this is] less well-known,” 
making the Scott Institute’s 
goal in arranging Energy 
Week to “increase the visibil-
ity of all [Carnegie Mellon] 
activities” related to energy.
Indeed, Energy Week 
demonstrates Carnegie 
Mellon’s influential position 
in all things energy. 
Moreover, it shows how 
the city of Pittsburgh has 
drifted towards a more 
renewable, sustainable and 
futuristic energy industry. 
This week-long event thus 
serves as a central nexus for 
all who wish to gain more 
insight into the energy in-
dustry and research taking 
place in the region. 
This time around, En-
ergy Week has a plethora 
of events coordinated with 
other universities and orga-
nizations, such as an energy 
law and policy forum with 
the  laws schools of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and 
West Virginia University. 
Demonstrably, Energy Week 
is chance for institutions to 
mingle and share their ideas 
about energy.
Last year’s Energy 
Week drew about 700 
guests across all five days, 
according to Professor Stine. 
Come March, Energy Week 
will be in full swing and the 
Scott Institute hopes that 
number will rise to 1,000.

activities, register at www.

istration is free for Carnegie 
Mellon students.

HOW THINGS WORK
DNA is an incred-
ible thing, carrying precious 
information in a small space 
to make you who you are — 
genetically, at least.
This double-helix poly-
mer carries all the informa-
tion required for growth, 
development, functioning, 
and reproduction for all liv-
ing things. DNA is made 
up of four nucleotide bases 
that pair up with each other 
– adenine (A) and thymine 
(T), and guanine (G) and 
cytosine (C). In a hierarchical 
structure, the base pairs form 
DNA, and the complete set of 
DNA forms the genome.
In humans, the genome 
manifests itself in the form of 
23 chromosomes, consisting 
of 3 billion base pairs. When 
your cells need to create pro-
teins, the genetic informa-
tion flows from DNA to RNA 
through transcription and 
then from RNA to protein 
through translation.
With such an important 
molecule, you may think 
that the information is set in 
stone and untouchable, but 
in the 1990s, scientists began 
looking into methods to pur-
posefully affect the genome. 
When DNA is manipulated by 
inserting, deleting, or replac-
ing segments in the genome, 
it is called genome editing.
In order to edit a genome, 
researchers have engineered 
nucleases, which are en-
zymes that can cut between 
the nucleotide base pairs to 
make smaller segments of 
DNA. There are currently 
four types of nucleases: zinc 
finger nucleases (ZFNs), 
transcription activator-like 
effective-based nucleases 
(TALEN), meganucleases, 
and the CRISPR-Cas9 system.
CRISPR stands for 
Clustered Regularly Inter-
spaced Short Palindromic 
Repeat, and consist of short 
sequences of RNA (called 
CRISPR RNA or crRNA) that 
can guide a system to a spe-
cific, matching DNA strand.
The CRISPR-Cas9 method 
consists of Cas9, which is 
the enzyme that cuts the 
DNA into smaller sequences, 
and guide RNA (gRNA), a 
combination of crRNA and 
tracrRNA that helps guide 
Cas9 to the part of the 
genome that needs editing so 
it can cut in the right place.
Like DNA, RNA is also 
made up of four nucleotide 
bases that pair off — adenine 
(A) and uracil (U), and gua-
nine (G) and cytosine (C). 
In order to locate a specific 
place in the DNA sequence 
of the genome, the gRNA 
will have complementary 
bases to the target DNA, thus 
only binding to the target 
sequence. The Cas9 enzyme 
then follows the gRNA to the 
target DNA and cuts it in two.
Of the four methods, 
CRISPR-Cas9 is the simplest, 
most versatile, and precise 
method, and was heralded as 
Science’s 2015 Breakthrough 
of the Year. It can be used to 
target multiple genes at the 
same time, which sets this 
method apart from the rest.
CRISPR-Cas9 (and 
genome editing, in general) 
has a lot of potential to help 
treat medical conditions that 
are caused by genetics. These 
can include various types 
of cancers, hepatitis B, and 
even cholesterol, to name 
a few. In April 2015, a team 
from China attempted to al-
ter the DNA of non-viable 
human embryos, which 
sparked wide-spread debate 
regarding the ethics of test-
ing gene-editing technology 
on humans. Their study con-
cluded that CRISPR was unfit 
for use in reproductive medi-
cine. Last year, in October, 
CRISPR gene-editing was 
testing for the first time on a 
human subject, by scientists 
at Sichuan University in 
Chengdu, China. It was an 
attempt to treat a patient 
with aggressive lung cancer, 
according to an article in the 
science journal, Nature.
However, as with any 
emerging biological tech-
nology, there are ethical 
concerns that accompany 
this method. There are two 
types of cells in the body – 
somatic cells, which are non-
reproductive cells, and germ-
line cells, which are. DNA 
from germline cells is passed 
from generation to genera-
tion. While gene editing in 
somatic cells is currently 
relatively uncontroversial, 
gene editing in germline cells 
would be passed to future 
generations and is currently 
illegal in many countries. Re-
gardless, scientists continue 
to make CRISPR-Cas9 even 
more accurate.

Robots programmed to acquire knowledge like children do
RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT
The Robotics Institute at 
Carnegie Mellon has been 
known to carry out some of 
the campus’s most futuristic 
and cutting-edge research. 
This week’s Research Spot-
light focuses on experimen-
tation conducted by Assis-
tant Professor of Robotics 
Abhinav Gupta and his team. 
Gupta’s research aims to 
improve the coordination of 
robots via the use of machine 
learning and visual learn-
ing. The research team and 
their project will be aided 
by a three-year $1.5 million 
award courtesy of Google.
“If you can get 
the data faster, 
you can try 
more things .”
—Lerrel Pinto
Ph.D. Student 
Robots are being used in 
a variety of fields, and one 
overarching requirement 
across the board is that the 
robots must have dexter-
ity when interacting with 
objects. This research shows 
that such nimble and pre-
cise movement cannot be 
achieved directly by hard-
coding it into the robot’s 
central processing unit, but 
rather by allowing it to heu-
ristically learn how to be-
have. Just as a child learns 
to hold different objects with 
time, so too do the robots 
Gupta experimented with.
Whereas research groups 
of yesteryear have suffered 
largely from data shortage 
and very expensive robots, 
Gupta and his team have 
benefited from the economic 
advantages of the robotics 
industry today. “The cost of 
robots has come down sig-
nificantly in recent years, 
enabling us to unleash lots of 
robots to collect an unprec-
edented amount of data on 
physical interactions,” com-
mented Gupta in a Robotics 
Institute article. With more 
and more data, combined 
with mostly isolated visual 
learning breakthroughs, 
robots can now use sensory 
information to understand 
the ever-changing physical 
world they occupy.
Excitingly, if one of these 
many robots learns some-
thing new, it can share that 
knowledge with the others 
through an adaptable net-
work. This greatly reduces 
the learning curve and less-
ens the man hours such 
experimentation requires. 
Lerrel Pinto, Ph.D. candidate 
and member of Gupta’s team, 
discussed the benefit of this 
faster data accumulation 
technique: “If you can get the 
data faster, you can try more 
things — different software 
frameworks, different algo-
rithms.”
Robots that are able to 
learn and adapt like chil-
dren, albeit within a slower 
time frame, are a huge step in 
the direction toward a more 
precise artificial intelligence. 
However, it is this research 
team’s method of data col-
lection that has the ability 
to benefit fields far beyond 
robotics.

Sleep pattern variation across cultures caused by evolution  
Sleep patterns in humans 
today are very different today 
from what they were a hun-
dred years ago. They have 
continued to change through-
out history, in both quantity 
and quality. Studying sleep-
ing patterns across cultures 
over time is important to un-
derstanding the effects sleep 
has on human health. 
Thus, researchers are 
looking to figure out wheth-
er this change in sleep was 
brought about by socioeco-
nomic, technological and 
political developments or if 
it is a product of evolutionary 
mismatch in early human be-
ings’ sleeping patterns.
A paper published in the 
American Journal of Physical 
Anthropology studied cross-
cultural sleeping patterns in 
an attempt to address this 
question. 
The study conducted by 
David Samson of Duke Uni-
versity, and his team analyzed 
the patterns in 33 volunteers 
of the Hadza hunter-gatherer 
community in Tanzania over 
a period of 393 days.
Such societies are typically 
under-represented in sleep 
research studies which pre-
dominatly comprise of west-
ern, educated, industrialized, 
rich and democratic social 
groups. The Hazda commu-
nity represents a small-scale, 
non-inductrialized popula-
tion that doesn’t have envi-
ronmental barriers such as 
air-conditioners, heaters, or 
sound-proofed rooms that 
would affect sleep.
As compared to 
western sleeping 
patterns, 
the Hadza 
community 
seemed to have 
shorter and 
poorer quality 
of sleep. Besides 
that, they also 
took frequent 
daytime naps 
for an average 
of 47.5 minutes.  
Hazdas seemed 
to have stronger 
circadian 
rhythms.
The researchers used wrist 
devices to gather informa-
tion and found that the sub-
jects slept for an average of 
6.5 hours per night despite 
spending a longer time in bed 
which averages around 9.16 
hours per night. 
Using a scalp device, 
on nine participants, the 
researchers also found that 
the villagers experienced 
shorter slow-wave cycles and 
rapid-eye movement which 
suggests a biologically rela-
tively light sleep. 
As compared to western 
sleeping patterns, the Hadza 
community seemed to have 
shorter and poorer quality 
of sleep. Besides that, they 
also took frequent daytime 
naps for an average of 47.5 
minutes. Despite that, Hazdas 
seemed to have stronger 
circadian rhythms.
According to an article 
about the study in Science 
News, westerners about 500 
to 200 years ago had similar 
sleeping patterns, i.e., two 
distinct spans of sleep in one 
day. Thus, this population 
has a lower sleep efficiency 
as compared to western, in-
dustrialized populations. 
Many other sleep research  
studies conclude that irregu-
lar sleep cycles and lack of  
exposure to sunlight increas-
es risk of heart disease and 
other health issues. Besides 
that, use of electronic devic-
es with blue-screens such as 
mobile phones, laptops, tele-
visions etc. after dark nega-
tively affects melatonin pro-
duction which delays sleep.
Furthermore, the study 
concluded that environmen-
tal factors such as light and 
temperature significantly 
impacted sleep duration and 
quality. Increased ambient 
light and temperatures at 
night were found to increase 
sleep quality. This observa-
tion was interpreted in the 
paper to mean that experi-
encing longer days (equiva-
lently more ambient light) 
and tropical temperatures, 
implied experiencing longer 
sleep duration.
Based on other interpre-
tations of the data they col-
lected, the researchers lean 
towards concluding that 
sleep plasticity, i.e., variation 
in sleep quality and quantity 
has been a product of natural 
selection in human evolution.

BASKETBALL, from A12
Some time later, Wash-
ington committed its sev-
enth foul of the half, result-
ing in one more point for 
the Tartans. The Bears then 
proceeded to make anoth-
er layup and another free 
throw due to a foul, making 
it 53–33. Another foul by the 
Bears gave the Tartans two 
made free throws, and the 
Bears committed another 
foul shortly afterward which 
gave the Tartans two more 
points. Two missed shots 
later, the Tartans committed 
another foul which resulted 
in one point for the Bears.
The Bears pushed forward 
again to get three points out 
of a layup and subsequent 
free throw before making 
another shot. The Tartans ?-
nally answered with another 
shot to bring the score to 59–
39, later adding two more off 
a layup. Washington made 
another shot before commit-
ting their tenth foul which 
gave a point to the Tartans. 
The Bears quickly got down 
the ?eld to force a foul, re-
sulting in an offensive re-
bound that led to nothing.
The Tartans tried to 
quickly get a three-pointer, 
but they were unable to make 
it. They were able to get an-
other point out of a Wash-
ington foul, and the Tartans 
later got a quick shot to bring 
it back to 64–45. Washington 
made another three-pointer 
before the Tartans called 
timeout to substitute all 
their players. Another three 
point shot brought the score 
to 70–45. The Tartans made 
one more shot before time 
expired.
While the Tartans were 
able to jump out into an early 
lead, the Bears were able to 
pressure the Tartans with 
many scoring attempts.
The fouls in the ?rst half 
added up quickly, and once 
the Bears took the lead, they 
moved too quickly to relin-
quish it. Making the most 
out of opportunities is some-
thing the Tartans were able 
to do early on, but it was 
the Bears who were able to 
make enough opportunities 
to overcome their early inef-
?ciency.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
rebounded against the Uni-
versity of Chicago, earn-
ing an 89–80 victory that 
brought the team to 10–8 
overall and 4–3 in the UAA.
The Tartans earned the 
lead quickly and never re-
linquished it. The Tartans 
opened the game shooting 
10-of-15 from the ?oor and 
built a 25–9 lead following 
a triple by Serbin with 11 
minutes to play. The Tartans 
maintained the double digit 
lead for the remainder of 
the half and led 47–32 at the 
break.
The Tartans opened 
the second frame with two 
quick baskets and led 51–32 
29 seconds in, but Chicago 
scored 14 unanswered as the 
lead shrunk to 51–46 at the 
16-minute mark.
A traditional three-point 
play by Crawford eight min-
utes later pulled the Maroons 
to within a basket at 64–62, 
but the Tartans responded 
with a 10 straight points to 
push the lead back to double 
?gures.
During the run, Maha 
accounted for seven points. 
Carnegie Mellon never saw 
its lead drop below eight 
points the rest of the way.  
Carnegie Mellon shot 
54.2 percent from the ?oor 
while Chicago shot 47.5 per-
cent. It marked the third 
time this season the Tartans 
shot above 50 percent, win-
ning all three. The program 
has won 51 of the last 62 
contests when shooting bet-
ter than 50 percent.
Four Tartans reached 
double ?gures in scoring 
with Serbin leading the way 
with 22 points. Serbin led all 
rebounders with 11 boards 
to record his league leading 
11th double-double. Junior 
guard Ryan Maha poured 
in 20 points and converted 
3-of-4 from behind the arc. 
Sophomore forward and 
guard Seth Henry and Mc-
Neil each contributed with 
12 points. Henry earned his 
second double-double of the 
season.
It’s clear that the Tartans 
took Friday’s loss to heart, 
turning things around on 
Sunday. They will need to 
continue to ?ght hard enter-
ing the ?nal month of play.
The Tartans will next 
travel to St. Louis for a re-
match against the Bears on 
Friday, Feb. 3.

Women’s basketball falls to Wash. U., will seek revenge
MARIKA YANG
Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s basketball team fought in 
a gripping, close game against 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) rivals the Washing-
ton University Bears, falling 
just short in the ?nal minutes 
of their second game of the 
season.
Scoring ?rst, the Tartans 
got to a quick start, but soon 
found themselves trailing 
early in the ?rst quarter after 
several consecutive baskets 
by the Bears. Neither team’s 
offense dominated, with the 
great defense of both sides 
dictating the ?ow of the game. 
The Bears’ stellar defense 
forced the Tartans to attempt 
several contested shots and 
make errant passes that the 
Bears turned into steals. The 
Tartans, however, refused to 
allow the Bears to run away 
with the same, keeping the 
score close and ending the ?rst 
quarter with the Bears leading 
17–12.
The second quarter contin-
ued the low scoring and kept 
the defense at the forefront. 
The Bears maintained their 
momentum and pulled away 
from the Tartans, extend-
ing their lead to nine points. 
The Tartans answered, led 
by senior guard Lisa Murphy, 
fresh off her Division III Player 
of the Week honor from the 
U.S. Basketball Writers As-
sociation and a career perfor-
mance last Sunday, who con-
tinued her superb play, leading 
the Tartans’ attack to put the 
squad within two points at 
29–27 with 1:31 remaining. 
The Bears responded, end-
ing the half with a 33–29 lead 
over the home team.
Both teams began the 
second half with fast starts, 
trading baskets. Each team 
gained the lead by a basket, 
only for the other to quickly 
tie the game. The rest of the 
third quarter saw the game at 
a stalemate, with neither team 
building any momentum nor 
willing to give the other any 
advantage. The third quar-
ter ended with the score tied 
55–55.
Entering the fourth and 
?nal quarter, the Bears fo-
cused on an aggressive at-
tack, scoring right at the start, 
only for the Tartans to tie the 
game up again. Just like the 
third quarter, no team could 
establish a ?owing offense 
or dominance, with no lead 
more than three points. How-
ever, in the ?nal minutes, the 
Bears surged, ?nding the same 
power they had in the second 
quarter, and slowly built a 
lead over the Tartans, going 
on a 6–0 run and maintain-
ing their strong defense. The 
Tartans tried very hard, using 
fouls and timeouts to design a 
comeback, but could not gain 
an upper hand over the Bears 
to clear the point de?cit. The 
game ended with the score of 
78–72, with the Bears having 
the edge over the Tartans.
This game was very close, 
a competitive contest from 
start to ?nish. The Carnegie 
Mellon and Washington Uni-
versity teams were very evenly 
matched. Though the Bears 
ultimately won, they did not 
dominate the game. The ?eld 
percentage of the teams were 
comparably similar, Carnegie 
Mellon with 39.1 percent and 
Washington with 42.4 percent. 
They had the same number of 
points in the paint (36) and 
nearly the same number of as-
sists and turnovers. However, 
the Bears won the competi-
tion for points off of turnovers 
(14 to the Tartans’ 5) and for 
points off the bench (29 to 9). 
For the Tartans, Murphy con-
tinued her impressive season 
?nishing with 32 points, 11 
rebounds, and a perfect 10 
for 10 in free throws. Senior 
guard Jackie Hudepohl added 
25 points. Though a loss to a 
UAA rival at home is hard, the 
Tartans played with resilience 
and toughness, battling the 
equally great Washington Uni-
versity Bears.
With their record now 15–2 
overall (4–2 UAA), the Tartans 
will next travel to St. Louis for 
a rematch against the Bears on 
Friday, Feb. 3.
IAN TANAYA

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team returned 
home to face Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis on Friday. 
The Tartans fell to the Bears 
70–47, bringing the Tartans’ 
overall record to 9–8 and their 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) record to 3–3.
The Bears got the ball from 
the opening tip-off, but it was 
the Tartans who struck ?rst, 
scoring seven unanswered 
points before the Bears ?nally 
made their ?rst shot to make 
it 7–2. After a second three-
pointer for the Tartans and 
a pair of Tartan fouls that re-
sulted in two points for the 
visitors, the Bears capitalized 
off a turnover to make a slam 
dunk to send the message that 
they weren’t going to give up 
easily. The Tartans settled 
into patient defense, keeping 
Washington from converting 
opportunities before making 
another three pointer to ex-
tend their lead to 17–6. The 
Bears continued to take shots 
but found themselves unable 
to make many of them before 
a Tartan foul gave them one 
more point off a free throw. 
Scoring for the Bears contin-
ued to be limited, with sopho-
more forward and center Pat-
rick Ehland often interrupting 
Washington’s scoring oppor-
tunities.
Coming out of a timeout, 
the Tartans rushed to make a 
three-point ?eld goal, but the 
clocks malfunctioned, causing 
the points to be rendered void. 
The Tartans were still able to 
get 2 points to go up 21–13 
before the game stopped 
again due to a malfunction 
in the shot clock. A dropped 
ball gave the Bears an easy 
two points, and after a series 
of turnovers, the Bears made 
another two points despite 
protests that senior center 
Chris Shkil had been pushed 
down. Another shot for the 
Tartans and two free throws 
for the Bears later, the Bears 
mounted an offensive assault 
that was stopped by the Tar-
tan defense many times. One 
free throw and another shot 
brought the Bears to a 23–21 
de?cit, and a missed three-
pointer allowed the Bears to 
get down?eld where the ninth 
team foul for the Tartans al-
most cost the Tartans the lead. 
A lane violation and a miss al-
lowed the Tartans to escape, 
but the failure to get points on 
offense gave the Bears another 
chance. The Tartans fouled for 
the tenth time, and this time 
the Bears made both attempts 
to tie the game at 23 apiece. 
The Tartans made their way 
back down?eld where two 
fouls allowed the Tartans to 
take time off the clock and 
the chance to retake the lead; 
however, both free throws 
missed, and the Bears made a 
buzzer beating three-pointer 
to take the lead 26–23 going 
into halftime.
The Bears got the ball to 
start the second half and got 
another shot after the ball 
changed sides twice. Senior 
forward Jack Serbin brought 
it back to 28–25, but the 
Bears quickly made another 
shot and to extend their lead 
to ?ve. After a foul against 
Shkil resulted in one made 
free throw attempt, the Bears 
struck again, extending their 
lead to 32–26 before the Tar-
tans took a timeout to try and 
stop the game from falling out 
of their reach. The Tartans 
began to push forward more 
aggressively, drawing another 
foul that resulted in two 
points. The Tartans were able 
to knock the ball out on the 
Bears’ next possession, and 
eventually forced a jump ball 
to get it back. Unfortunately, 
Serbin was unable to get in a 
two point shot before the shot 
clock ran out, giving the ball 
back to Washington. Another 
foul by the Tartans gave the 
Bears two more points, ex-
tending their lead to 36–28 
before another takeaway from 
the Bears resulted in a further 
two points. A missed three-
pointer by the Tartans was fol-
lowed by a made three-pointer 
by the Bears, bringing the 
score to 41–28.
After another timeout, the 
Bears earned two more points 
before ?rst-year guard Co-
lin McNeil made a layup and 
an additional free throw due 
to a foul. After another shot 
clock expired on the Tartans, 
the Bears made another three 
point shot, and another foul by 
the Tartans gave the Bears two 
free throws and brought the 
score to 48–31. The Tartans 
advanced again and got one 
point off a Washington foul, 
but the Tartans fouled again 
two possession changes later, 
allowing the Bears to make 
two more free throws to take 
the score to 50–32.

Men’s basketball loses to Bears, perseveres past Maroons
Plaidie Daddies, Dreamland Warriors advance to ?nals
IAN TANAYA
Sports Editor
While everyone (hope-
fully) had an enjoyable break 
to get ready for this semester, 
the Tartan II fantasy football 
league concluded its four 
weeks of playoffs. Editor-in-
Chief India Price’s Plaidie 
Daddies upset the heavily fa-
vored DeMarco DePolo of Zeke 
Rosenberg to make it to the 
fantasy championships, while 
my Dreamland Warriors came 
back from behind to squeak 
past Publisher Jade Crockem’s 
Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood. 
With so much action over 
these weeks, the ?nal results 
will have to wait to be chron-
icled until next week. Until 
then, here’s a recap of the ?rst 
round of playoffs.
What an upset! In Week 14, 
the Plaidie Daddies got off to 
a massive 153-104 lead driven 
by Denver Broncos wide re-
ceiver Emmanuel Sanders, 
the Atlanta Falcons defense, 
and Philadelphia Eagles tight 
end Zach Ertz. While Falcons 
quarterback Matt Ryan and 
Green Bay Packers wide re-
ceiver Jordy Nelson gave over 
20 points each to Rosenberg, 
an injury to San Diego Char-
gers running back Melvin Gor-
don and poor performances by 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide 
receiver Mike Evans and the 
Detroit Lions defense put him 
into a deep hole that his team 
was unable to escape from.
While the scoring output 
for the Plaidie Daddies de-
clined to 92 points in Week 15, 
DeMarco DePolo was unable 
to capitalize due to under-
whelming performances by 
Miami Dolphins running back 
Jay Ayaji, Pittsburgh Steelers 
wide receiver Antonio Brown, 
and Evans. Such is the cruel 
twist of fate that can befall a 
team that dominated the regu-
lar season but came up short 
in the playoffs.
Crockem amassed an im-
pressive 120-92 lead over my 
team in Week 14 thanks to the 
play of Broncos wide receiver 
Demaryius Thomas, Packers 
quarterback Aaron Rodgers, 
and Packers wide receiver 
Devante Adams. On my end, 
Indianapolis Colts wide re-
ceiver Donte Moncrief left his 
game due to injury, resulting 
in zero points. Other players 
who underwhelmed with sin-
gle digit performances were 
New Orleans Saints quarter-
back Drew Brees, Arizona 
Cardinals wide receiver Larry 
Fitzgerald, and Tennessee Ti-
tans tight end Delanie Walker.
Crockem’s good chance of 
victory faded away in Week 
15 after a 149-111 score in my 
favor. Brees put in a strong 29 
point rebound, while Bills run-
ning back LeSean McCoy and 
New York Jets running back 
Bilal Powell ?nished with high 
scoring performances as well. 
Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood 
saw tremendous output from 
Packers running back and 
wide receiver Ty Montgomery, 
Dallas Cowboys running back 
Ezekiel Elliot, and Thomas, 
but shortcomings from Adams 
and Minnesota Vikings wide 
receiver Adam Thielen cost 
the team victory.
Layout Manager Abhishek 
Tayal’s team had the edge 
from the very start, as his 
Week 14 performance against 
Alex Wood’s team earned him 
a 123-98 lead. While Colts 
wide receiver T.Y. Hilton and 
Baltimore Ravens running 
back Kenneth Dixon put up re-
spectable numbers, the week 
was over when Steelers run-
ning back Le’Veon Bell earned 
a massive 51 points against 
the Buffalo Bills, hiding four 
single point outputs behind a 
tremendous day for Bell.
The 103-91 edge Tayal 
earned in Week 15 sealed his 
victory. Both teams matched 
up evenly: a strong perfor-
mance for the Loquacious Los-
ers by Dolphins wide receiver 
Jarvis Landry was balanced 
out by Panthers quarterback 
Cam Newton. A poor perfor-
mance from Washington Red-
skins tight end Jordan Reed 
was negated by a marginally 
better one from Seattle Se-
ahawks tight end Jimmy Gra-
ham. Both kickers also gave 
their respective teams more 
than ten points. With nothing 
to break past what was essen-
tially a stalemate, not even the 
Loquacious Losers could lose 
to the extremely trash team.
Pillbox Co-Editor Sinead 
Foley may have had a rela-
tively hands off approach to 
fantasy football, but it was still 
enough to take down Sarah 
Gutekunst’s team. Week 14 ba-
sically decided this matchup 
as Foley climbed to an insur-
mountable 105-54 lead. Lions 
quarterback Matthew Stafford 
and Colts running back Frank 
Gore were the only two play-
ers to score double digits for 
McManus’s Anus, while only 
two players scored single dig-
its for Foley’s team.
With such a huge de?cit, a 
91-86 score in favor of What 
is going on? certainly did not 
help Gutekunst’s case. With 
nothing left to play for, it 
seems both teams were con-
tent with letting single-point 
players litter their rosters. It 
appears that Gutekunst’s ?rst 
year in fantasy did not give her 
much of an edge against the 
competition this year.
Like most of the other 
matchups this round, Lula 
Beresford’s Masshole Knicker-
bockers earned their victory in 
Week 14, crushing Foley’s sec-
ond team 125-77. Though four 
players for Beresford’s team 
scored in the single digits, 
strong performances by New 
England Patriots quarterback 
Tom Brady, Cincinnati Bengals 
running back Jeremy Hill, and 
Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert 
overwhelmed Foley’s team, 
which only had San Francisco 
49ers running back Carlos 
Hyde to parade.
While Foley’s team tried 
to come back in Week 15, an 
86-66 margin was not enough 
to make up for the Week 14 
thrashing. Falcons running 
back Devonta Freeman’s 
32-point performance was 
the dominant performance in 
a matchup that featured 11 
single digit players, many of 
whom had sustained injuries.

Overcoming insurmountable obstacles
Dear Sarah,
Yesterday when I woke up, I went to check the 
news, as I always do, on Facebook trending. I was 
prepared for just another sign of the apocalypse, 
but the one that I got shook me to my core.
Wet Seal will close all of its locations. No one could 
have seen this coming. I’ve been shopping there to 
stay at the forefront of sugar baby fashions ever 
since my parents gave me my first AmEx. When 
this season’s Wet Seal goes out of style, I don’t 
know what I’m going to do. I need to transition 
to a new line by summer without missing a beat. 
What are my options?
Sincerely,
Rest In Panties
Dear RIP,
Girl, I know exactly how you feel. Facebook 
trending really ruined my day with this one. We 
sugar babies have to stick together through this. 
I’ve planned the ultimate shopping trip, only 
requiring one quick bus trip. Start out in Oakland 
on Forbes Avenue at the hottest spot in the 
neighborhood: Rue21. You may have to push 
through crowds of Pitt students getting after the 
latest in choker trends, but it’s worth it. Then walk 
just a block and a half to catch the 75 inbound 
from Fifth and Atwood, then get your little booty 
off at Sidney and S. 28th and you’re basically at 
Forever 21. Shop till you drop, but if you don’t 
drop, you’re still walking distance away from 
Urban Outfitters, H&M, American Eagle, and 
BCBG!
Try not to max out!
Sarah
Dear Sarah,
I’m feeling really stressed about this first 112 lab, 
and all I want in the whole world is a pint of Ben 
and Jerry’s Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch. The crunchy, 
rich pseudo-caffeination calls my name, singing 
sweet songs of sweeter dairy-induced comas. The 
only problem? It is too freaking cold to go outside 
right now, let alone down a pint of frozen sugar. 
My heart and soul need the ice cream. This lab 
is creating a hole in my heart that is exactly Ben 
and Jerry’s shaped. But I get full-body chills just 
thinking about bearing the elements for a block of 
ice. What should I do?
Sincerely,
Seriously Troubled and Upset Coding Kid
Dear STUCK,
You know what you need to do. There is no 
question that you must embark on this mission, but 
it will require much preparation. 
First, you must put on three layers of the warmest 
clothing you possess. Second, you must do 
jumping jacks to work up an intense sweat that 
cannot escape your poly-blend cocoon. Finally, 
wrap up till you can’t move your arms. After that 
much ice cream you probably won’t be able to 
anyway. Now, you are ready for whatever may 
lie ahead, muscles warm enough to jog if need be, 
and body temperature elevated enough to almost 
enjoy the chill.
Enjoy!

Izzy Sio | StaffwriterTwenty One Pilots Concert
In the spirit of the Emotional Roadshow’s stop in Pittsburgh, a glimse into a TØP show  
It is the second night of the Columbus-based 
musical duo Twenty One Pilots’ Emotional 
Roadshow World Tour, and flocks of cars slowly 
inch their way to the Webster Bank Arena in 
Bridgeport, CT on Jan. 18. I walk up to the 
entrance and see empty water bottles as the 
remains of teenage girls’ efforts spent waiting for 
the chance to see this revolutionary band bring 
their “ukulele screamo,” “schizophrenic pop” 
music to my hometown.
Performing before the alternative hip-hop duo was 
alternative bluegrass folk rock band, Judah and 
the Lion. With their banjos strumming, the band 
refused to show anything but their true selves, 
performing covers of T-Pain’s “Booty Wurk (One 
Cheek at a Time),” complete with twerking, and 
The Killers’ tried-and-true classic “Mr. Brightside” 
with their own hits from their latest album Folk Hop 
‘N Roll. The band brought an Imagine Dragons-
like vibe to their voice and music, making them 
an unexpectedly pleasant, odd, yet wonderful 
surprise. Before playing their last song “Take It All 
Back,” the band thanked Twenty One Pilots for 
the invitation to tour with the band, praising how 
their alternative and unique brand of music helped 
pave the way for similar artists to break out to 
wider audiences, and for burgeoning musicians to 
explore more of the vast realms of music.
Next fellow breakout musical act and American 
rapper and hip-hop artist Jon Bellion took the 
stage with Travis Mendes. Bellion’s recent fame 
comes from his hit “All Time Low,” which had 
just hit Platinum at the time of the concert. He 
brought even more excitement to the huge crowd, 
performing hits from his latest album The Human 
Condition. Travis Mendes accompanied Bellion as 
the latter freestyled, and Mendes provided smooth 
vocal accompaniment and chemistry to Bellion’s 
dance moves and style. Bellion was also extremely 
thankful to Twenty One Pilots for the last minute 
addition to the tour, saying “it was only the second 
night of the tour and it already had felt like we 
had become best friends.”
When Twenty One Pilots finally made an 
appearance on stage after what felt like ages to 
the fans around me, they refused to disappoint. 
Throughout the night, they kept the audience 
riding a huge high, incorporating the pit crowd in 
their crazy stunts that ranged from crowd-surfing 
with a giant hamster ball to playing drums in the 
crowd, truly making the audience a part of the 
experience. They performed a mix of songs from 
their most recent hits “Heathens” and “Ride” to 
some of their older classics like “Ode to Sleep.”
Other highlights included a moving cover of My 
Chemical Romance’s “Cancer,” mixing the moving 
and emotional roots of the original song with their 
own style, creating a heartfelt masterpiece. The 
duo also brought back Judah and the Lion and Jon 
Bellion on stage for a few covers, including the 
Blackstreet classic “No Diggity,” The Black Eyed 
Peas’ “Where is the Love,” and House of Pain’s 
“Jump Around.”
Twenty One Pilots’ songs are not just rap and hip-
hop. They’re rap, alternative, hip-hop, rock, even 
pop, and they fuse these genres to create music 
that’s alluring and wholly original in a time where 
it’s difficult to stand out in the music industry. And 
that individuality has created a wave of change in 
its wake. Yet throughout their sudden rise to fame, 
the duo has always remained humble and thankful, 
hoping that their audience — whether it be two 
people or two million people — enjoy their show.

“How can you be a revolutionary when you’re so busy 
being a traditionalist?”
La La Land challenges its viewers to put themselves in 
the shoes of Seb, portrayed by Ryan Gosling, and ask 
themselves this question. In the movie, Keith (played 
by John Legend) uses this question to taunt Seb, con-
vincing him that the route to making genuinely revolu-
tionary music is breaking free from his purist jazz roots.
The same question applies to 
movies themselves. In an 
industry dominated by 
mass marketed fran-
chises on one side, and 
expansive sociopo-
litical musings on the 
other, is there room for 
a good old fashioned 
musical? In an era when 
‘great’ and ‘different’ 
have become 
practically syn-
onymous, can 
a simple love 
story — the relatable 
kind, that has been 
told a million times 
before — possibly 
be considered revo-
lutionary? La La Land 
is evidence that some 
tropes never go out of 
fashion.
For all the hype and noise around it, 
what struck me most about La La Land 
was the raw, unsophisticated joy to be 
had within it. The protagonists are Seb, a 
struggling jazz pianist and Mia, played by 
Emma Stone, a struggling actor. La La Land is 
the story of their relationship, from its sexy beginning 
to its bittersweet conclusion.
Set against the backdrop of the stunning Los Angeles, 
the movie paints its leads as flawed dreamers — 
fighting for a break in jazz music and acting, both 
brutally unwelcoming industries, with little more than 
sheer talent and a deep, inspiring passion for their 
respective fields. Watching Seb sit down at a piano 
and convey more through melody than words could 
ever capture, we are introduced to his understated, 
under-appreciated genius. Later on, Mia toils away, day 
and night, on a play she writes, organizes, and is the 
sole cast member of, even without the guarantee of 
an audience.
Through his leads, director Damien Chazelle plumbs 
human nature to explore why some of us follow our 
dreams with such a passionate fervor. Why do we 
persist, even when the odds are thoroughly stacked 
against us? La La Land tells us that as great as romantic 
love is, the greater love is a love of ideals, which trans-
lates into a love for work and ambition.
La La Land may be simple, but it is not simplistic. The 
movie’s visual aesthetic is arguably the most unique 
since 2009’s Avatar. Every single shot is composed in a 
way that can only be described as a live painting. The 
city of Los Angeles is Chazelle’s canvas, which he wash-
es in soft pastel hues that serve to humanize the glamor 
and ethereality of Hollywood. The cinematography and 
color grading lend a poetic and overwrought sense of 
beauty to the proceedings. When Seb and Mia finally 
kiss at Griffith Observatory, the entire scene is perfect, 
as if that moment was long written in the stars.
The music and choreography effectively use technol-
ogy to liven up a traditionalist ethos. The movie opens 
with a massive musical number in the middle of a Los 
Angeles freeway. This scene, shot outdoors on a busy 
thoroughfare, is full of long cuts and fluid camera 
motion capturing literally hundreds of extras. This is 
impossible without the relatively lightweight, mobile 
digital cameras that modern directors often use for 
large outdoor scenes. Another iconic scene, Mia and 
Seb’s first dance, is shot on location in Griffith Park at 
night. The spectacular sunset backdrop and lighting 
effects that make the scene pop would be impossible 
in low light without the digital color grading that is bril-
liantly applied in post-production.
The songs themselves tell a similar story. 
They are reminiscent of musicals from 
the ‘30s and ‘40s — slick, simple, and 
just a little pulpy. And yet, it all seems 
sharpened and enhanced with 
modern sensibilities and recording 
techniques. Both leads are good 
singers, and Ryan Gosling as 
a pianist is a revelation. The 
melodies themselves toe a 
fine line between authen-
tic jazz and cross-cultural 
appeal, as is expected 
with film soundtrack music.
For all its overwrought emo-
tion, La La Land works best in its 
subtler moments — Seb hopelessly 
trying to negotiate his setlist with a 
by-the-books restaurant manager, Mia 
intentionally requesting he play an 
out and out commercial song to bug 
him, or Seb turning around to walk 
back to his car after spending 10 
minutes walking her to hers. 
La La Land, through its simple 
“boy-meets-girl”,“dreams 
and ambitions” story reminds 
us why we go to the movies 
in the first place.

Silence is a new film directed by Martin Scorsese 
and starring Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, and 
Liam Neeson, based on the 1966 novel of the 
same name by Shusaku Endo. The story centers 
around two Jesuit priests in the 17th century sent 
from Portugal to Japan to spread thier faith. 
It was shown by Pittsburgh Filmmakers at the 
Harris Theater,and is now playing at AMC Loews 
Waterfront 22.
Recently, the idea of a “happy ending” has 
become tenuous. From where I stand, and in the 
news I read and hear, the notion that the moral arc 
of the universe must bend, eventually, toward the 
light has become a bit difficult to swallow. I think 
I’ve believed that concept, without too much con-
sideration, for my whole life. I’d go as far as say-
ing that most people surrounding me through the 
years have had this subconscious faith as well: that 
although shadows will inevitably cross our paths, 
the story can never culminate in anything other 
than triumph, confident and untouched by doubt.
Many of us are raised to believe in watchful eyes 
and attentive ears, something bigger than us guid-
ing that moral arc, caring for us. It can be “God,” 
but call it what you will. We wrap ourselves up in 
the warm security of a divine purpose, and many 
of us may never be given a reason to doubt. In 
Silence, Garfield’s character, Father Sebastião 
Rodrigues, could easily have felt this unconcerned 
security in faith until he died. But instead, he and 
fellow Jesuit Father Francisco Garrpe, played by 
Driver, in an effort to rescue a priest, played by 
Neeson, lost in his mission to an anti-Christian 
nation, set sail for Japan. The year is 1639.
The film is spent in quiet, the first hour made to feel 
arduous, uncomfortable, long. From the moment 
the priests set foot in Japan, expectations are 
raised and shattered, reflecting the experience 
of these men of extreme faith. In a land entirely 
strange to them, the discomfort of an ascetic life is 
only the most superficial beginning to how they will 
be tested. But even the idea of “testing” becomes 
questionable. Who is doing the testing? If it is God, 
then is every event a reflection of his will? If these 
men are here on a truly holy mission, then how 
does one explain the horrors they unintentionally 
inflict upon innocent strangers? And with all these 
questions pounding relentlessly in their minds, the 
absence of revelation becomes increasingly intoler-
able. The unanswered deaths of good people are 
underscored by nothingness, the camera itself giv-
ing the impression of a casual, uncaring observer 
to this extreme drama.
As Endo describes in the original novel, “behind 
the depressing silence of this sea, the silence of 
God ... the feeling that while men raise their voices 
in anguish God remains with folded arms, silent.”
To my mind, there were very few films released 
this past year that matched Silence in its ability 
to speak truth to the human condition. Scorsese’s 
obsession with adapting the 1966 novel, a mis-
sion he shouldered for decades, picks him out as 
one of the most interesting spiritual investigators in 
film today. Silence has been compared to another 
recent, well-received movie, Mel Gibson’s Hacksaw 
Ridge, also starring Garfield. What I gather about 
the comparison applies if you compare Silence to 
any number of other spiritually-minded movies: 
Silence is uniquely ambiguous. The movie submits 
questions and issues which get progressively more 
complicated and challenging as the story moves 
forward, only to end in an ellipsis.
The thought of an alternate universe where Father 
Rodrigues stays in Portugal and continues to 
emulate Christ with impunity, zealously spreading 
the word he loves so sincerely, is an exception-
ally relevant point. Within certain communities, it 
is entirely possible to believe in the simple, moral 
righteousness of the universe. What appeals to 
me so dearly about Silence is its admission that 
reality is not nearly so simple. Our platitudes and 
notions that bring us comfort can be helpful, of 
course, but it’s ridiculous to imagine that the world 
is so straightforward. How do we allow inargu-
able tragedy into our belief systems? How does 
our view of the universe cope when faced with 
purposelessness?
Silence does not provide the answers. This is not a 
detriment to the movie, but rather an enormously 
mature attribute. Although full of hope and hap-
piness, the world is an inevitably difficult place, 
and we do it a disservice to pretend that the right 
path will always, ultimately, be taken. We do 
ourselves a disservice to think that it’s not worth 
critically thinking about our actions and the grey 
area of consequences that result. Silence compels 
us to understand that, although God or meaning 
could exist, neither will guide us so assuredly by 
the hand.

I almost didn’t go.
Around Christmas, the highly contentious debates 
I had with my parents about social issues and 
identity politics came to a point of eruption when 
I mentioned that I was (and am) a feminist. I had 
successfully avoided the topic with them for six 
years, knowing my explicit honesty and progres-
sive stances were unwanted in the house.
Amidst the yelling and interruptions, my Dad 
shouted, “If you go to that women’s march, 
I won’t be speaking to you for a year.” That 
finally shut me up, because I knew he meant 
it. But my thoughts kept racing. Was he 
being unreasonable? Was I supposed 
to choose family over my beliefs? If 
I chose to go, I would disrespect the 
views of my elders, and cause them 
to lose face within our community. If 
I didn’t go, I would abandon my own 
values and morals, and silently imply 
that I was perfectly fine with inaction 
in a pressing time of need. The central 
question was, which one was worse? 
I decided the latter was and quietly 
drove to Washington, D.C.
I attended the Inauguration ceremony 
on Friday, and wedged myself between 
Trump supporters and protesters on 
Pennsylvania Ave. across the street 
from the Trump International Hotel. Primarily 
looking to snap a few good pictures of the histor-
ic moment, I quickly began to realize how uncom-
fortable I was about the situation. Trump’s voice 
permeated the area, his words slightly distorted 
by the overhead speakers. The dismal weather 
cast a washed-out and pale look across people’s 
faces. Many fights broke out, eruptive and intense 
like firecrackers placed randomly along the 
blocks. Looking up at the American flag, I feared 
for the country’s future and overall well-being of 
its citizens. I witnessed individuals incapable of 
rational and civil behavior, instead preferring to 
exacerbate the hostile environment. They jeered 
and intimidated others, and oftentimes engaged 
in physical altercations. They looked like strang-
ers to empathy. I think that’s what scared me the 
most. Whatever idea I initially had that this event 
would provide didactic potential and enlighten 
me on issues I overlooked died.
At the other extreme was my experience at the 
Women’s March the very next day. Being a part 
of the nation’s largest one-day protest in history 
was empowering and uplifting. Standing in the 
Dupont Metro while watching carts loaded with 
warmly dressed women, men, and children, I 
knew the turnout rate would be far greater than 
I initially expected. I stepped onto the National 
Mall crowded with kindred souls, streams of 
people headed towards the various rallies and 
music installations that blared from a distance. I 
heared intermittent cheers and roars of celebra-
tion as I squeezed my way through, eager to 
catch a glimpse of the action.
My arms ached from holding my sign, demonstrat-
ing my years of athletic inactivity. My back ached 
from the hours of standing I did the day before 
as well. 
I didn’t really care, though. Initially disheartened 
by the apparent misalignment of America’s values 
shown by the outcome of this election, I found sol-
ace in marching alongside 500,000 other people 
who had not forgotten about the importance of 
the equal, fundamental rights we deserve, protect-
ed by the principles of our nation. I felt the power 
of an effort that will be in it for the long-haul, a 
movement that stands in solidarity for the protec-
tion of women’s rights, health, and safety.
The spirited people surrounding me echoed this 
message in a myriad of ways. Some angrily, 
some joyfully, some just wanting to add humor, 
to shed some light following a dark day. Eager 
to denounce the billionaire Republican President 
whose attention on women is likened to that of 
a rapist, people held signs with clever slogans 
that were peppered throughout the crowd. Some 
of the highlights were “We shall over comb,” 
“Trump is the BLOTUS: Biggest Liar of the United 
States,” and “It’s not the Bill of Suggestions,” 
among other (more vulgar) phrases. 
Women’s March, Washington, D.C.
An emotional day for us all

Feminist icons like Gloria Steinem, Cecile 
Richards, and Alicia Keys not only attended the 
march but also spoke at the rally, reinvigorating 
the audience with preachings of their visions of 
a better, more equal world for our children. The 
long crowd made its way to the White House and 
then beyond, inevitably spilling into streets not 
even planned for the march. Individuals really 
couldn’t escape the crowd, much less ignore the 
message we were delivering. I chanted, “This is 
what democracy looks like” and “our bodies our 
rights” until my voice broke. Although I was often 
lost in the sea of people, pink hats, and hand-
made signs, I never felt drowned out or forgotten.
However, I am well aware of the shortcomings of 
the Women’s March. In its effort to collectivize 
and brand itself, the march has inadvertently left 
out key players of the community. It has received 
backlash for the pink, cat-eared hats worn dur-
ing the march, popularly labeled as the “p**** 
hats,” as the vagina is not a fitting symbol for 
those who identify as female but don’t have one. 
I personally saw that many disabled people strug-
gled to enjoy the moment as much as others, their 
wheelchairs stuck in the same place as marchers 
carried on, disregarding them.
Some activists, notably Angela Peoples, took 
the opportunity to point out the distinct polar-
ity between white women and black women that 
undoubtedly marked the 2016 election. In her 
viral photo, Peoples holds a sign that reads, 
“Don’t forget: White women voted for Trump.” 
Her stoic demeanor provides a stark contrast 
to the white women wearing the pink “p**** 
hats” whose attention on their phones and selfies 
epitomize the attitudinal divide between the two 
demographics. Many women of color contended 
that failure to address these disparities will make 
them invisible in the movement. Their views are 
valid: often times movements meant to elevate the 
rights of those more vulnerable to prejudice and 
discrimination prioritize the voices of women who 
are able-bodied, straight, white, and cisgendered. 
We should constantly make provisions for the 
diverse nature of women in the U.S. and around 
the world when advocating for our rights. If we 
normalize such conflicting behavior, we are then-
exposed to our own hypocrisy.
The new administration needs to be reminded that 
the citizens they were sworn to dedicate their 
service to include people of all ethnicities, back-
grounds, race, sexual orientation, religion, class, 
etc. Diversity is our strength. Women are our 
strength. Protect the rights of those who are most 
vulnerable. Don’t be an a******.

Classy. Honest. Innovative. Those are the three words that best describe 
Carnegie Mellon’s all-male, award-winning a cappella group, The Originals. 
Classy, because of each member’s evident poise and charm; honest, because 
of the genuine passion and soul they bring to their songs; innovative, because 
their performances are for sure unlike anything you’ve ever seen or heard 
before. Getting to spend some time with them before their Thursday night 
rehearsal really helped me get to know the group better. Before my meeting 
with The Originals, I didn’t know too much about them or the world of a cap-
pella. I entered their rehearsal in McConomy Auditorium having absolutely no 
expectations.
While walking down the stairs of the auditorium, I was greeted right away 
with a friendly “hi” from one of the members, Leo Galvan. He seemed to be 
the only one in the room at the time. As I took a seat, a few more members 
of the group came from the side doors, laughing and talking with each other; 
I could already get a strong sense of their supportive and brotherly group 
dynamic. They all welcomed me, and they were very excited to promote their 
upcoming performance on Tuesday, Jan. 31 at 8 p.m., where they’ll be open-
ing for the hit a cappella group MIX. 
MIX is a co-ed a cappella group from the University of Colorado Denver 
that has won many awards, including first place in the International 
Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA). They’re currently touring 
around Pennsylvania on their PA Takeover Tour, and excitingly one of their 
stops is right here on campus in the Cohon Center’s Rangos Ballroom. Galvan, 
a sophomore tenor in The Originals, commented on having the opportunity to 
open for such a successful group like MIX: “We’ve actually never opened for 
a professional a cappella group, and this is really an amazing opportunity to 
talk and interact with and see people who do this for a living … it’ll actually 
be such an incredible experience and we’re really excited to share it with the 
community.” Sophomore JP Leigh, who does vocal percussion for the group, 
also talked a bit about how sharing the stage with MIX will benefit their work. 
“It’s always good for us to see other a cappella groups to help us improve, 
because we’ll maybe see something inspirational from them that we can put 
into our future performances. [That] goes along with watching and enjoying it, 
it’s also an educational experience.”
As more and more members of the group began to arrive for rehearsal, I 
started getting a much clearer picture of the family-like bond The Originals 
share with one another. There are eleven members in the group, all represent-
ing different grades, with two fifth-years, three juniors, three sophomores, and 
three first-years. The underclassmen look up to the upperclassmen, and they 
all treat each other like brothers. The group dynamic was one of the reasons 
why first-year Ben Stern, a baritone in the group, decided to join The Originals 
last semester. “They’re really a great group of guys. We’re all happy and it’s 
like a family here.” Already having a sense of The Originals’ fun and friendly 
personalities, I couldn’t wait to watch them rehearse a bit of their performance 
for Tuesday.
The group started off rehearsal with some vocal warm-ups. Now, this was my 
very first time ever seeing an a cappella group perform live, and I was hon-
estly left speechless from just hearing The Originals practice harmonies. Once 
they began rehearsing two of their songs for Tuesday’s performance, rendi-
tions of “Home Alone” by Ansel Elgort and “Closer” by The Chainsmokers, 
I actually wanted to start singing along with them. You could really feel the 
passion and energy they gave to their singing, and their stage presence really 
made it clear that each and every member loves what they’re doing. For The

Originals, it’s all about conveying passion, honesty, and getting a message 
across to their audience. Nitsan Shai, a Fifth Year Scholar and baritone in the 
group, talked more about the group’s sound: “We really pride ourselves in 
performing very honestly. If there’s a song that has a lot of meaning to us, we 
try to project that as much as we can emotionally in a performance.” Earlier, 
the group had even recalled a recent performance in Atlanta, Georgia that 
“challenged gender and masculinity standards,” where one of the members, 
sophomore baritone Ramsey Pack, dressed up in drag during a performance of 
Beyonce’s “I Care”. “It was a statement piece where everyone around us was 
represented, the masses that help out and support the LGBTQ community. We 
made that statement and after everyone came up to us and was like ‘We really 
appreciated how honest you were in your performances,’ Leo explained. “What 
we put out on stage is what comes from our hearts and what we really believe.”
Besides their singing, another way in which the group is able to speak to their 
audiences is through their choreography. Leo elaborated on that by referring 
to another one of their songs they’ll be performing on Tuesday, “Cellophane” 
by Sia: “For Cellophane, it actually tells the story of mental illness, so we have 
a lot of cage-like choreography moves. And basically it helps us tell the story, 
even beyond the song. What the song can’t tell, we tell with our bodies.” 
Unfortunately I was unable to see their choreography during rehearsal, but it 
definitely sounds like they’ll be putting on a powerful performance.
It was an absolute pleasure getting to spend time with The Originals, and I 
have no doubt that the group and their audience will have an amazing time on 
Tuesday. It will surely be an experience like no other to watch a live a cappella 
performance, especially from two very talented groups. Tickets for the show are 
available online at carnegiemellontickets.com or at the door Tuesday night for 
ten dollars. It’s an opportunity you won’t want to miss.

Take Ten: The Promise & Perils of Secular Music
Sidewalks of paranoid locals 
study me. A rough man grips 
a large, nearly empty bottle. I 
struggle to make eye contact. 
He lifts his vice and slurs, “D’ya 
know what this’s for?” He throws 
it to the ground. Glass shrapnel 
pegs my shoes. He is now out of 
alcohol. I keep walking. Loiterers 
on the opposite side of the 
street blast peculiar music: Black 
Sabbath’s “Nativity in Black.” 
Recognizing the opening bassline, 
I stop. The street ends with a glass 
entrance. I open the doors to a 
colorfully dim binge where N.I.B. 
is inexplicably louder. I weave 
through the crowd as Lucifer 
sings his mantra: “please take my 
hand.” A tall, gothic woman rush-
es towards me. Startled, I notice 
a second set of doors, but my 
putty hands are useless. My body 
becomes numb. The room spins, 
and I sink to the floor as the final 
guitar solo blares in full effect. 
Holding a syringe, the woman 
approaches me and coldly utters, 
“I don’t know why you do this to 
yourself,” as she injects me.

Room retention
Room retention, the first phase, is for students planning to retain their current room for 
the next school year. Although there are some exceptions, room retention is available to 
most upperclass students, except those in themed housing, a first-year residence hall or 
apartment, or an RA/CA room. First-year students are not eligible to retain their rooms, 
regardless of their room location. Students considering room retention should remember 
that once they retain, they cannot change or cancel their housing assignment until the 
open cancellation period begins.
Room with a retainer
Students retaining their rooms during the first phase are required to fill any vacancies 
in the room, suite, or apartment with “pull-ins.” In order to be “pulled in” to a room, 
students must be eligible to participate in Room Selection and must not have already 
selected an assignment for the school year.
Block housing
The block housing phase of room selection allows groups of students to select a 
“block” of rooms near each other in one of the applicable residence halls or apartments. 
Students electing to apply for block housing must identify a group representative who 
will be responsible for setting up their block housing group on the housing application 
and will remain the main contact point between the group and Housing Services.
General room selection
General Room Selection is the final phase of Room Selection. During this phase, 
students eligible for housing who haven’t participated in the preceding phases choose 
a room from the remaining spaces. Students planning to participate in general Room 
Selection must apply online. They are then given a random timeslot for Room Selection.
Themed housing
Themed housing allows students to apply for housing centered around a certain 
interest or theme. Themed houses are detailed on page six of this guide.
RA/CA housing
RA/CA housing is only available for those students holding an RA or CA position during 
the 2017–18 school year. These students will not be eligible to participate in Room 
Selection, and will instead be assigned a room through the application and selection 
process carried out by the Office of Student Life.
Gender-neutral housing
Gender-neutral housing, available in the Oakland Community Apartments, permits 
upperclass residents of different genders to reside in the same room. There will also be 
a gender-inclusive housing-themed living community in Morewood Gardens.
Open assignments
Due to fluctuating availability in room assignments, some students are given an 
open assignment. This means that while they are guaranteed a room for the 2017–18 
academic year, they will not immediately know where that room will be located, or 
what style of room they will be assigned. After receiving an open assignment, students 
wait until they receive an offer for a room for the upcoming year. After receiving their 
offer, they can decline the offer and cancel their housing agreement within three days 
without penalty, even if the offer was made after the open cancellation period ends.
For more details about the Room Selection process, visit  
www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection.
Room Selection offers students several options: room retention, room with a retainer (also known as a “pull-in”), block housing, general 
room selection, themed housing, RA/CA housing, gender-neutral housing, and open assignments.
Most students will participate in one of three Room Selection choices: room retention, room with a retainer, or general room selection. 
However, a wide variety of housing options is available to all students. Room Selection begins on Feb. 22, so all students returning next 
year should be actively thinking about their housing plans for the 2017–18 school year.

Phase deadlines and other information 
What’s new for 2017 Room Selection and selection phases
Housing Cancellation Fee to replace current Housing Reservation Fee
Starting with the 2017-2018 academic year, the current $400 Housing Reservation 
Fee will be replaced with a Housing Cancellation Fee, which will only be assessed 
to those residents who are canceling their housing contracts. All housing cancella-
tions made after the April 7, 2017, Open Cancellation deadline will only be granted 
if the student is leaving the university for an approved reason (leave of absence, 
withdrawing, studying abroad, academic or financial suspension, part-time status, 
etc.) and will be subject to the Housing Cancellation Fee. The Housing Cancellation 
Fee will be $400 for students who cancel for or during the fall semester or full aca-
demic year, and $200 for students who cancel for the spring semester only. Seniors 
who are graduating in December and exchange students who will only be here 
for the fall semester should be especially mindful of this cancellation fee, since 
failure to pay it in a timely manner may delay release of your transcripts. 
Block Housing Leader Responsibilities and Building Options
Beginning with the 2017-2018 academic year, the Block Housing Group Leader will 
have the added responsibility of being the liaison between their group with RA, CA, and 
Housefellow staff.  Should there be any issues with members of your group during the 
year, house staff will contact the Block Leader to address those concerns and the Block 
Leader is expected to be responsive to this type of outreach. Morewood Gardens will 
continue to be an option for groups of six to 12 residents applying for Block Housing, in 
addition to Fairfax, Webster, and Shady Oak Apartments. Additionally, there will be 
two 6-occupant block options in Neville Apartments, one 8-occupant block option in 
Margaret Morrison Apartments, and one 8-occupant block option in Resnik House.

Living on campus vs. living off campus 
Questions to ask and tools to help you decide
Deciding whether or not you want to live on campus next year can be a tough decision. Both on-campus and 
off-campus living have their appeals, and the right option will almost definitely come down to each individual’s 
unique living needs.
Use the chart below to determine the costs of living off campus versus living on campus. The column on the left 
shows what is included in on-campus housing. Ask prospective landlords the cost of each of these items listed 
below and fill in the dollar amount next to the appropriate icon. For items or services that you do not believe are 
applicable to you, write 0 in the blank. Total all costs and compare to the cost of living on campus as you make 
your decision for next year. Chart provided by Housing Services.
If you do choose to live off campus next year, Carnegie Mellon’s off-campus website is a good resource: https://
offcampus.housing.cmu.edu/
Questions to ask when deciding where to live:
If you are considering moving off campus, be sure to ask 
these questions, provided by Housing Services, before you 
sign a lease:
Rent and Additional Costs
Is there an application or holding fee? If yes, what is the 
cost?
What utilities are included in the rent?
How much is the security deposit?
When is the rent due?
Leases
In case you plan to study abroad for part of the school year 
or summer, are variable lease options available (six, nine, or 
12 months)?
Is individual lease liability offered?
How many people is this unit legally zoned for? In the city 
of Pittsburgh, it is illegal for more than three unrelated indi-
viduals to live together in a residential dwelling. 
Do you have a rental license on file with the city of 
Oakland?
Will I be able to sublet my unit in the summer or for study 
abroad?
Repairs and Maintenance
Will any repairs be made to the unit prior to move in?
How quickly do you make repairs when there is a work 
request or maintenance issue?
Do you take before and after pictures to help guarantee I get 
my security deposit back?
Amenities
What type of security does the building offer?
What type of parking is offered?
What appliances are provided, and how old are they?
Who is responsible for yard maintenance and snow 
removal?

Just a 10-to-15-minute walk (or ?ve-minute bus ride) from campus lies Oakland, the 
home of late-night food, University of Pittsburgh pride, and a population made up 
almost entirely of college students. 
Oakland is home to some of Carnegie Mellon students’ favorite restaurants, including 
Con?ict Kitchen, Chipotle, Fuel and Fuddle, and The Porch. For students over 21, 
Oakland has a solid group of late-night destinations, such as Hemingway’s, Mad 
Mex, and a liquor store with an extensive selection. Another bene?t of Oakland is the 
availability of affordable housing close to campus. Oakland Avenue and Atwood Street 
are lined with housing for both Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students.
Most people living here are always up for fun; if you’re looking for a quiet 
neighborhood, Oakland may not be your cup of tea. Oakland should be noted for its 
lively atmosphere and is ideal for anyone looking for college-oriented surroundings.
OAKLAND
Shadyside is home to upperclassmen from Carnegie Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh, graduate students, and young working professionals. Accessible by bus, it 
tends to be slightly pricier than Oakland or Squirrel Hill; however, it is the most charming of 
the areas surrounding campus, with its tree-lined streets and boutiques. The neighborhood 
is best known for two things: shops and bars. Walnut Street is lined with a wide variety 
of shops, and cozy restaurants like Mercurio’s and The Yard Gastropub are interspersed 
among the shops.
While the area near Shadyside’s bars can be particularly loud from Thursday to Sunday, 
Shadyside is generally a very relaxed, quiet area. The young professionals and the college 
students who live there are diverse  — from artists to technical majors to medical students. 
Shadyside is a great area for anyone looking for either an escape from campus or a popular 
shopping and nightlife experience.
SHADYSIDE

NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODSHOUSING GUIDE
Squirrel Hill starts just up the big hill on Forbes Avenue. It is either a 20-minute walk 
or a three-minute bus ride from campus, and the buses are very frequent. The cost of 
living in Squirrel Hill is higher than in Oakland, but lower than in Shadyside. In addition 
to housing upperclass students from Carnegie Mellon, Squirrel Hill is also home to 
faculty and Pittsburgh families not associated with the university. Squirrel Hill has a 
diversity of restaurants, from Thai food at Silk Elephant to breakfast at the original 
Pamela’s Diner. The restaurants are dispersed among small shops, including those on 
the main thoroughfare of Forbes Avenue.
It is not a college neighborhood like Oakland and Shadyside, and it does not have a 
prominent bar scene. It does have a residential atmosphere, however, that the other 
two areas lack. For someone looking for a short ride or walk from campus with all the 
necessities within walking distance and a wide variety of cuisines, Squirrel Hill may 
be the right place to look for a home to rent.
