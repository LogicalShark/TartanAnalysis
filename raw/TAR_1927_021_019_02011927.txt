CARNEGIE VS. PITT
THE BASKET BALL teams çt Carnegie and Pitt wlii meet to­
morrow night at Carnegie gym. In the second.game' of the .series. The 
first game was-chialked -up- on the'Tartan’s aide of the ledger, but 
this means nothing tomorrow. Since that game, Carnegie haa loat to 
W. d. J. and Grove City, while Pitt lost to. West Virginia and defeated 
W. & J. It Is going'to be a real battle, because the Panther does'not 
take.kindly to defeats by Carnegie, end Carnegie has the Incentive 0» 
clinching the series with a victory. One thlng la certain, and. that Is 
* every Carnegie student able'to walk should be at the gym tomor-
night to give the team some vocal encouragement.,

THE-GROVE CITY GAME
CARNEGIE’S BASKET BALL team put up a game battle wilh the 
Grove City quint on- Saturday evening, and came near causing- the 
downfall of the great Crimson five. The entire team played fine baskist 
bail, although CapUln Ray Hurd was . the big gun,'displaying the 
brand of'ball he is really capable of. Had it not been for poor foul 
¡hooting, seven out .of fifteen, that game would now be listed as a 
Carnegie victory. However, considering tbe layoff over exams, the 
team deserves a world of praise for the showing they made.
A CHALLENGE FROM JAPAN
THE MESSAGE received at Ruddy’s offico last Wednesday, from 
Waseda University of Tokio, Japan, requesting a baseball game with 
Caraeglo Bome timo in June, proves two IhiogB conclusively: That 
the reputation of Carnegie now extends to the Far East, and that 
Pung Chow is not the only game played in Japttn. They certainly 
have a good baseball team to want to inrade this country, beard­
ing thé lion In his-den—with his own claws! Too bad baseball Is no 
inger a recognized.Bport here, or a game might have been arranged.
"DOC" MARKS TO ASSIST PIRATES
DOCTOR MARKS confirmed the report that he is (o receive, a 
>rlng leave of absence in order to go west with the Pittsburgh PI' 
rales’ baseball club, to assist in conditioning tho men. It seems that 
last season's downfall was partially blamed on aliments incurred by 
the players in training camp, and this year.they decided to tafce a physician along. *
t is certain that they could not have secured a belter man than 
or the-job. He knows bis stuff about his prof&sion-and can take 
care of any. ailment which develops. If the Pirates don’t cop the 
tnt this year, theyll have to look elsewhere for an alibi!

Now that the examination period

it has beon decided.by a body rep-

hail might be. used'for'purposes

soli believing! in the theory, of su- 
psrorlty of mind over metter w^re 
vehy reluctant to give up such a 
buildlDg to such mundane pur* 
suits. They were finally convincod 
by copious use of clubs, bombs and 
machine guns that it was. all right 
to play basket ball at odd inter­
vals providing that, those .who 
played had already passed a'course 
in Calculus showing thorn to be 
lentally'flt for thè game.
Our friends on yonder hillside

at the first-home game of the sea*

Once upon a time there was a man whose 
life's ambition was to take unto himself a 
pipe. Time and again his heart was set on 
some particular pipe—but poor fellow, his 
dreams never came true. . .
Until one day a friend; experienced in 
such afiairs, gave him a few pointers.- He 
took his friend’s advice; he got some 
Granger Rough Cut... Itworked! Inafew 
weeks' time he was solidly wedded to a 
wonderful pipe., .sitting pretty .fixed forlife!
Indeed, but for Granger many a man 
would never know the joy and comfort of 
a pipe! Granger is so: mild, so mellow, so 
cool! Ripe old Burley tobacco, mellowed 
Wellman's way. And cut in rough flakes 
that bum slow and smoke tool.. .
Granger's mission in life is to see that 
no man ever experiences a pipe disappoint­
ment.. . Just stick to Granger and your 
old pipe'll be a perfect pal—right through 
the years.. Forever!
