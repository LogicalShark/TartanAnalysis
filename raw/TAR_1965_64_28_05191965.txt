CIT Employees Vote 
On Union Affiliation
Dr. H. Guyford Stever, president of Carnegie Tech, 
announced on Friday a proposal presented by the school to 
Charles C. Levey, president of Local #29, Building Service 
Employees International Union.
The plan calls for a consent*- "
election, to be held on this cam­
pus, for “all service and mainten­
ance employees, including cafe­
teria employees ... so that they 
may determine for themselves 
whether they wish to be repre­
sented by this particular union.”
The proposal resulted from a 
request by Levey in March for an 
appointment with R. D. Strath- 
meyer, Carnegie Tech vice presi­
dent for business affairs, for the 
purpose of negotiating an agree­
ment between the school and Local 
#29, on behalf of the school’s 
service and maintenance em­
ployees.
Levey claimed, at that time, that 
a majority of these employees 
were members of his local, thus 
S enabling him to negotiate on their 
behalf.
Vice President Strathmeyer did 
not grant Levey’s request for sev­
eral reasons. Strathmeyer “ex­
pressed doubt” about Levey’s 
claim that a majority of Carnegie 
Tech’s service and maintenance 
employees are members of his 
union. He also questioned the ap­
propriateness of Levey’s negotiat­
ing on behalf of service and main­
tenance empolyees only, for this 
group does not include cafeteria, 
employees, who should, in the 
school’s opinion, be involved.
Strathmeyer believed that the 
latter question “could best be re­
solved by the National Labor Re­
lations Board, (NLRB), although 
he expressed doubts that they 
would accept jurisdiction. Levey 
complied ana petitioned the 
NLRB.
Although the board did not ac­
cept jurisdiction, Levey himself, 
in his petition, included cafeteria 
employees among those to be rep­
resented by his union.
To clarify Strathmeyer’s first 
objection, the school proposed the 
consent election. Dr. Stever com­
mented on the proposal in his 
written statement of Friday:
“We believe our proposed action 
has the merit of giving our em­
ployees a choice of voting for or 
against union affiliation. This is in 
contrast to Mr. Levey’s original 
proposal that we negotiate with 
his union as a de facto representa­
tive of our employees; a proposal 
which we did not feel we could 
accept. Nor did we feel free to 
accept Mr. Levey’s earlier limi­
tation on the group of employees 
who could be eligible for member­
ship in the event the union were 
to represent them.”
In an interview on Friday with 
KDKA-TV’s Al McDowell, Dr. 
Stever clarified Carnegie Tech’s 
position in labor matters: “For 
more than fifty years Carnegie 
Tech has enjoyed cordial em­
ployee relations without the pres­
ence of a union.” He stated that 
if some employees now desire 
union affiliation, “it is important
Fulbright Award
Raymond L. Gindroz, graduate 
architect, received a grant from 
the Department of State to study 
architecture at the University of 
Rome.
This award was made under 
the Fulbright-Hays Act which is 
designed to strengthen relations 
between the United States and 
other countries of the world.
that all employees express their 
opinions.”
Levey apparently finds the pro­
posal satisfactory, although, ac­
cording to R. D. Strathmeyer, he 
is still expressing some hesitancy 
about the inclusion of cafeteria 
employees.
The election is slated for this 
Friday in Skibo. It is to be con­
ducted under mutually approved 
rules.
Employees in the following 
categories will be eligible to vote: 
cafeteria employees, janitors and 
custodians, maids, and all other 
employees of the Operations and 
Maintenance Department.
When questioned by McDowell 
concerning Dr. Stever’s expecta­
tions of the election results, the 
president replied, “I don’t know. 
But we won’t negotiate with Levey 
prior to the election.”

Deferred Payment Offered 
To Tech Undergraduates
Carnegie Tech is extending to all undergraduate day students, the opportunity of 
using a deferred payment plan beginning with the fall semester of 1965.
* ThisSC Approves Budget 
For New School Year
by Candy Etkin
for the 1965-66 academic year.
The allocations are as follows:
Tartan$6,000
Technical$4,500
WRCT$2,500
Thistle$1,500
Patterns$ 650
Student Congress$4,500
Debate Team$1,750
Kiltie Band$4,000
Cameron Choir$1,700
Rifle Team$ 600
W3NKI$ 700
Delta Skull$ 1-50
International Club$ 100
Music Society$ 100
Part of the allocations for pub-
lications, which receive the largest 
share of the budget, is intended 
to supplment advertising receipts.
This policy, known as “matched 
advertising,” allows more campus 
service without the need for ex­
tensive advertising.
Also announced at the meeting 
was that committee chairmen seats 
are now open. These positions 
can be filled by any qualified stu­
dents.

To Establish Repertory Theater

arrangement has been 
initiated “to assist students and 
parents in making financial ar­
rangements for the payment of
| fees.”
On August 15, 1965. the Cash­

Student Congress convened in its first formal meeting I or in pf 1’so”, w^h lful1, partial
er the chairmanship of Richard Elder on May 12. j or™fore^September”! 196? °"Congress debated and accepted a budget totally $28,750;or be[0,e September 22, 1965.
This bill form will offer to 
students the opportunity to use the 
deferred payment plan. The plan 
requires one-third down payment, 
plus a second like payment on or 
before October 20 and a final like 
payment on or before November 
20. Payments are made after credit 
is taken for deposits, scholarships 
and loans.
The school recommends that al) 
undergraduate day students who 
find it possible, return their bills 
by mail in advance of their ar­
rival on campus.
All payments received in this 
manner will help eliminate the 
need for students to stand in line 
during the final days of the pay­
ment period (September 13th 
through September 22nd), and 
will permit transaction relative to 
payments for miscellaneous fees 
(laundry, parking, laboratory de­
posits, etc.), to be handled more 
expeditiously.
Identification cards will be 
given to each student who has 
paid his bill in part or in full 
when he registers for classes.
Previously, the deferred pay­
ment plan was not fully publicized 
and a majority of students made 
payment in full during registra­
tion. Also, freshmen who wished 
to make deferred payment had to 
make a down payment of of 
their fees.
For the present time this billing 
and payment method will not 
apply to graduate and evening
class students.
Carnegie Tech and the Pitts­
burgh Playhouse Association re­
cently announced plans for an 
affiliation which will establish in 
Pittsburgh a unique repertory 
theatre program and an educa­
tional plan for the participants 
in the proposed repretory theatre.
The affiliation will be known 
officially as “The Carnegie Tech/ 
Playhouse Company.”
It has retained the nationally 
famous director, William Ball, 
and his American Conservatory 
Theatre Foundation to establish 
the repertory concept in two of 
the three theatres at -the Pitts­
burgh Playhouse.
The Carnegie Tech/Playhouse 
Company will be established with 
two purposes in mind.
It will “seek to develop an 
imaginative program of theatre 
arts in Pittsburgh by means of 
the professional production of a 
season of plays in Playhouse thea­
tres.”
It will also “develop and pur­
sue an educational program in 
the theatre arts for selected per­
sonnel who will be involved in 
the program/'
Under Ball’s direction, the
American Conservatory Theatre 
Foundation will bring to Pitts­
burgh a comparatively large 
group of professional actors, tech­
nicians and designers. The pro­
fessional company will be aug­
mented as needed by local act­
ors, technicians, and designers.
Ball is now in the process of 
selecting participants in the pro­
gram. He will soon announce his 
production schedule for the six- 
month period.
The establishment of the Car­
negie Tech/Playhouse Company 
to present theatre in repertory 
to a Pittsburgh audience is an 
outgrowth of an informal asso­
ciation between Carnegie Tech 
and the Pittsburgh Playhouse that 
goes back many years.
Each season, students from 
Carnegie Tech’s drama depart­
ment participate in Pittsburgh 
Playhouse productions and in­
structors from the two institu­
tions are regularly exchanged.
Directors from Carnegie Tech 
have directed many Playhouse 
productions.
Rehearsals for the first produc­
tion will begin about June 1. 
The production is scheduled for 
public showing cm July 15.
More than 500 parents, predomi­
nantly from the tri-state area at­
tended the annual Freshman Par­
ents’ Day to hear talks by the 
deans, see the campus, witness a 
class in session, and take part in 
any of a number of optional pro­
grams available.
Following registration at 9:40 
a.m. the group was welcomed by 
Marshall Richard Gile, freshman 
class host, from Kingston, Massa­
chusetts.
In addition, Dr. H. Guyford 
Stever, president, and Dr. George 
K. Brown, dean of student affairs, 
delivered brief welcoming re­
marks.
The visitors then divided into 
groups to hear talks given by the 
deans of Carnegie Tech’s under­
graduate colleges and divisions.
From 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. the par­
ents were free to talk with deans, 
discuss the ROTC program, or par­
ticipate in a guided tour of the 
Hunt Library and the Hunt Bo­
tanical Library.
The day concluded with a Pres­
ident’s party hosted by Dr. Stever 
for students and parents in the 
ballroom of Skibo,
Fall Residents Review
‘Honor’ Dorm Policies
Residents of the More wood Gardens ‘honor dormitory' 
met on Sunday to review the A-tower provisions and elect 
officers for the fall semester.
According to the tower pro­
visions, the dormitory arrange­
ment was instituted with the un­
derstanding that “all senior wom­
en be given personal responsibil­
ity for their own actions,” and that 
a dormitory governing body be 
established.
At the meeting, Mrs. Harriet 
Thorpe, resident head of women’s 
housing, explained that the A- 
tower women will have no curfew.
Special numbered identification 
cards would be issued in the fall 
and A-tower residents would be 
permitted to enter the dormitory 
at any hour by showing these 
cards to the security guard at the 
door.
According to Mrs. Thorpe, the 
security guard will not be quali­
fied to “pass judgment on the 
condition of any woman entering 
the dormitory.”
It has been proposed that in the 
future, keys be issued to all A- 
tower residents, permitting them 
to enter the dormitory at will
The A-tower floors, Mrs. 
Thorpe announced, will have no 
quiet hours or floor counsellors. 
However, the residents will be re­
quired to abide by the Morewood 
Garden’s rules with regard to men 
and alcohol.
Men will be permitted in the

Tutor Project 
Supported By 
Tech Students
Cindy Morse
The North Side Tutorial 
Project is a community en­
deavor supported by Carnegie 
Tech, the University of Pitts­
burgh, Duquesne University, 
and Chatham College.
With the campus coordination of 
Jean Bernard Altmeyer, forty-two 
Carnegie Tech students participat­
ed this year in the program.
The students were working out 
of the Manchester Settlement 
House. They tutored at the settle­
ment house, and at neighboring 
churches on Saturday mornings.
Their pupils were residents of 
the area and were in grades 4 
through 12. They were tutored in 
history, science, literature, En­
glish, math, foreign languages, and 
business.
Tutors were encouraged to take 
their students to at least two 
cultural activities in addition to 
the regular study program.
Barbara Blasdel, one of the 
Carnegie Tech tutors commented 
that, “we not only try to improve 
the grades of our students, but we 
also try to establish relationships 
with people they are not usually 
in contact with others.”
Connie McGeorge said that she 
really didn’t realize the problems 
she had to face in educating her 
student until she visited her home. 
“Many of the tutees’ parents are 
working and there are six or seven 
other children in the family. If a 
tutor takes interest in the student, 
she gives him security he would 
not ordinarily have. It is also very 
rewarding to see a student develop 
a motivation for education.”

Student Guides
The campus YMCA and YWCA 
are seeking student guides for the 
approximately 80 foreign students 
coming to Carnegie Tech next 
semester.

one foreign student. The assign­
ments will be made early in the 
summer, to allow time for corres­
pondence between the students.
In September, the guides will 
tour Pittsburgh with the foreign 
students. They will introduce the 
students to faculty members, and 
help them register.
Student guides must have at­
tended Carnegie Tech for at least

Fage 4 — CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN — Wednesday, May 1», 1965
Fditoriol
Study Time?
This semester, classes will end on Tuesday and finals 
will begin on the next day. We object to this academic 
-chedule.
Students are held responsible for daily assignments until 
•“hat Tuesday. They are required to submit term papers by 
*hat date.
When are students given the opportunity to study for 
finals? When can they review the entire term’s work of 
their five or six courses?
Next week, many of them plan to cut Monday and 
Tuesday classes in order to study for their Wednesday, 
Thursday and Friday exams. They should not have been 
forced to resort to such action.
There should be at least a weekend between the final 
lav of classes and the first day of finals.
Princeton has such a “reading period,” (It is three weeks 
long.) Penn State has a “reading period” of several days. 
Carnegie Tech should have one too.
The Academic Affairs Committee is presently consider- 
;ng an academic calendar which will eliminate finals. (See 
Tartan of May 12.) But this calendar, if accepted, will go 
into effect in 1966-67.
Therefore, this same committee should review the finals 
schedule in the 1965-66 calendar.
It should attempt to understand the student’s dilemma 
and provide a reasonable solution.
If the proposed 1966-67 calendar is not accepted by the 
committee and finals remain as a part of the academic 
schedule, serious consideration should be given to formallized 
“reading periods.”

To Tarton Coverage
Editor the Tartan:
What happened to the Tartan 
coverage of Spring Carnival?
From last week’s issue one 
could barely guess that the cam­
pus had just completed the big­
gest week-end of the school year.
The eager reader had to ferret 
out from among the ads and filler 
stories a dull listing of “who won 
what” that came to a piddling fin­
ish in a tiny box on the last page, 
three odd pictures scattered about 
(four if you count the one used for 
the CORE article), and only two 
respectable articles about UMOC 
and the Sweepstakes races — the 
latter written by a non-staff mem­
ber who drew upon his initiative.
I’m not saying that the front 
page Items were not newsworthy 
—they certainly were. But I be­
lieve that three days of well at­
tended, all-campus activities, the 
numerous awards given, and the 
months of preparation behind the 
events for both the over-all plan­
ners and the participants are 
I worth at least a decent middle 
page spread.
Not only was the reporting 
meager and unimaginative, it was 
also noticeably incomplete.
A story on Call Day was no­
where to be found. It’s very im~
; portant to know that Dr. Stever 
spoke to Student Congress, but 
it’s equally important that he 
spoke at Call Day when he offi­
cially opened the week-end’s ac­
tivities festivities with complete 
sanction of such relaxation and 
fun in balancing a school year's 
activities.
There was no mention that at 
this time people received special, 
previously un-publicized, honors 
ranging from scholarship awards 
to activities keys. Neither was

I mittee was more exciting than the 
post-Carnival Tartan coverage. 
Surely it isn’t the committee’s re­
sponsibility to take care of that, 
too. What are the Tartan report­
ers and photographers for? What 
I is the Tartan for?

pearing in the TARTAN, al­

CORE Protest Aggravated 
By Students' Reactions
Editor, the Tartan:
On Saturday of the Spring Car­
nival weekend there was a protest 
by the Congress of Racial Equal­
ity. The account of this incident as 
it appeared in the Tartan did not 
relate the entire picture, although 
the facts which were reported 
seemed accurate.
Originally the CORE com­
plaint was of a minor nature. 
It is doutful that anyone in the 
offending fraternity had in­
tended the figures to be deliber­
ate insults.
It must be realized however 
that people were made uncom­
fortable by the figures and these 
people requested a change.
Subsequent action, including the 
repainting of one face, were 
obvious and vicious affronts, di­
rected squarely at the Negro peo­
ple. Such actions are irresponsi­
ble and rather sickening.
But other student reaction 
eaused incidents which were 
degrading to this institution and 
revealing, in that murderous 
racial hatred is not a phenome­
non indigenous to the south..
The crowd that gathered to con­
front the dozen or so CORE pick­
ets came frighteningly close to be­
ing a mob. One must remember 
that a supposedly “petty” inci­
dent lay at the heart of all this 
raw emotion. One wonders what 
would happen if a significant 
event had taken place.
The crowd taunted and jeered 
the protestors — some comments 
were better termed obscene. The 
words were used indiscriminately 
for both male and female pro­
testors.
One proud American youth ran, 
at the first sign of trouble to get 
his Confederate flag. Upon re­
turning he attempted to organize 
a sufficient body to attack the 
pickets. Remember, now, this is 
not Selma.
Another brave soul stood, with 
one arm around his girl friend’s 
shoulder, directly in the path of 
one of the CORE workers as the 
protest was disbanding. His words 
were to the effect, “you walk 
around me black man.” I indeed 
hope this person’s girl was prop­
erly impressed by his noble ac­
tions.
All in all the crowd tottered on 
the precarious edge of violence. 
And stupid action by Tech stu­
dents in no way helped keep the 
situation from erupting into a 
frenzied brawl.
Someone might reply that ii 
CORE had not protested there 
would have been no incident. This 
is indeed true. But this is supposed 
tc be a nation wherein a man can 
complain freely and where he can

and because most students were

Pittsburgh Festival Offers
Arts and Photo Exhibits
Five Exhibitions and two out­
door symphony concerts will sup­
plement the juried arts and photo­
graphy exhibitions when the 6th 
Annual Three Rivers Arts Festival 
of Carnegie Institute opens May 
28,
The other shows will be Graph­
ics Arts Techniques, Original Art 
from Stefan Lorant’s “Pittsburgh,” 
works by 17 invited artists Urban 
Design and Westinghouse Electric 
Corporation Purchase Awards.
Graphic Arts Techniques will 
explain lithographic, woodcutting 
and sérigraphie processes. The 
display will be located in and ad­
jacent to the South windows of 
the Arthurs LeStrange & Co., 
Gateway Building IL
William C. Libby has planned 
this feature and will use his own 
lithography for demonstration. 
The explanation of serigraphy 
(silk screening) will be based on 
George Nama’s prints. The section 
on woodcuts will utilize works by 
John Del Monte. Photographic 
slides are being prepared by John 
M, Miller and narration by Char­
les Hettinger.
Original Art from Stephen Lo­
rant’s “Pittsburgh, the Story of 
an American City,” will include 
some of the original works of art 
which are reproduced in the book. 
Windows in the Pittsburgh Na­
tional Bank, Gateway Building IV, 
will be used for the exhibition.
Works by the 17 invited artists 
is another 1965 innovation. It will 
include framed works by Jerry 
L, Capian, Greta Holst Evans, B. 
G. Galey, Janes Haskell, Marie T. 
Kelly, William C. Libby, Cecilia 
R Lieberman, H. Douglas Picker-
ing, Thomas Quirk, Samuel Rosen­
berg, and Harry Schwalb.
The invited sculptors are Janet 
DeCoux, Robert Lepper, Eliza 
Miller, and Clark Winter.
Rose Bank and Ronal McNeish, 
craftsmen, have also been chosen

the city. A series of panels will 
contain sketches, photographs and 
text. A space frame which was 
designed specially for the 1964 
exhibition will again be used in 
the Plaza adjoining Gateway 
Building IV. The exhibition is be­
ing planned by C. Richard Hays.
The Westinghouse Electric Pur­
chase Awards will be shown in 
the first floor windows of the 
sponsoring corporation, Gateway 
Building III. The seven art objects 
chosen from the Festival by the

It isn't easy to become an officer in the United 
States Army. Only the best young men are selected. 
The training and course of study are demanding.
But if you can qualify—and you should find out if you can—you will receive training which will put 
you a step ahead of other college graduates. Army 
ROTC training will give you experience that most 
college graduates do not get—in leading and man­
aging other men, in organizational techniques, in 
self-discipline and in speaking on your feet. This 
kind of experience will pay off in everything you
do the rest of your life.\
* Army ROTC has a new program designed spe^ 
cifically for outstanding men who already have 
two years of college, and plan to continue their 
college work. During your junior and senior years 
in this program, you will receive $40 per month. 
Want to find out more about the program? Simply 
send in the coupon below, or see the Professor of 
Military Science if you are now attending an 
ROTC college. There’s no obligation—except the 
one you owe to yourself.

their last five matches. CIT’s

GSIA And BTP Battle 
For Ail Sports Trophy
by Charles Beard
CIT Thinclads 
Finish At 5-4
With only softball and golf yet to be completed, the 
All-Sports Trophy competition has narrowed to two teams, 
BTP and GSIA. The present standings are BTP-41, GSIA-37, 
ATO-27, SAE-26, and Grad Nads-18.
The results in golf will almost*' 
surely be GSIA first and BTP 
second; this would give BTP 45 
and GSIA 43. However, in softball 
BTP did not even reach the play­
offs, and GSIA is in the semi­
finals. This guarantees them at 
least 2 pts., enough to tie BTP.
They can beat BTP by winning 
just one more softball game.
This past year was a complete 
success in IM competition with a 
record number of teams and 
athletes participating. To help 
those who have poor memories of 
the past season, gathered below 
are short summaries of the various 
sports so that you may sit back 
and wonder what went wrong and

The Tartan track team, feel­
ing the year-end let-down, fin­

sler (86).
In the match with St. Farncis, 
Biaiser again was the lone vic­

Prengaman salvaged a tie in best- 
ball competition. Low scores were 
registered by Johnson (78), Mul- 
holland (80), Biaiser (82), and 
Prengaman (84).
In a close match with Wash­
ington and Jefferson a different 
scoring system was used, giving 
each individual match a possible 
four points. Winning all four 
points were Biaiser and Kessler. 
Salvaging single points were

the Most Valuable Player in each 
sport.
Athletic Director Mel Cratsley 
acted as master of ceremonies for 
the evening. The program fea­
tured brief talks by each of the 
coaches and by Dr. S. Guyford 
Stever, Carnegie Tech president.
Stever’s remarks about “not using 
academic excellence as a crutch 
for athletic deficiency” were well- 
received.
Eight varsity athletes were 
named the Most Valuable Players 
in their respective sports. Those 
selected were: FOOTBALL, Pete 
Mangarella; CROSS - COUNTRY,
Harry Burkholder; BASKET­
BALL, Jeffrey Kalin: RIFLE,
Richard Damberg; TRACK, Chris 
Macosko; TENNIS, Salim Khan;

GOLF, Dale Johnson.
The highlight of the evening 
was the presentation of the all-
anr*
sports trophy, given each year 
to the student voted the most 
valuable athlete ta Carnegie 
Tech. This year’s winner was 
Chris Macosko. Chris was select * 
ed on the basis of his record- 
breaking performances in cross­
country as well as his role as 
high scorer on the track team.
The letter-winners in the eigbjm 
intercollegiate sports participates 
in by Carnegie Tech were also 
announced. The top letter-winner 
this year was senior Henry Wer- 
ronen. Hank has been awarded 
eight varsity letters, four in track 
and four in basketball, while at

Several records were broken 
by CIT athletes this year. These

SAE Rules Volleyball Courts
SAE was literally king of the 
courts as they picked up all their 
all-sports points, 26, in volleyball. 
They took firsts in co-rec., team, 
and 3-man volleyball, and a third 
in team volleyball. The MVP was 
Harvey Gammon of SAE. Also 
picking up points in volleyball was 
the Grad Nads with seconds in 
team and 3-man volleyball. Tak­
ing second in co-rec. volleyball 
was ATO.
ATO Takes Bowling
It took a while to get started, 
but once ATO got rolling they 
smashed all opposition to pick up 
a first in bowling. Second place 
went to GSIA “B”.
GSIA Wins at Water Polo
Water polo was closely contest­
ed all the way down to the wire 
with the deciding game being a 
narrow 2-1 victory for GSIA over 
second place ATO. Taking third 
place was BSR.
