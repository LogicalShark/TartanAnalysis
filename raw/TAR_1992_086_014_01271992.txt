Senate petition forces ROTC referendum

The fate of a Student Senate 
(resolution condemning the dis­
crimination within ROTC and 
falling for the eventual removal 
bfthe program from campus will 
*goon be in the hands of the stu­
dent body. A petition by Senate 
member-at-large Pat Mooney, 
boasting almost 400 signatures 
by people interested in main­
taining the ROTC program on 
campus, has pressed the Senate 
into organizing a campus refer­
endum to poll general opinion.
The resolution, passed in No­
vember, condemns ROTC’s 
policy against giving gays, lesbi­
ans, and bisexuals military 
scholarships and finds the Uni­
versity in violation of its own 
statement of nondiscrimination. 
The referendum will take place 
within three weeks from 
toworrow.
Attitude in Senate is increas­
ingly divisive as members find 
themselves weighing the 
ROTC’s benefits to students and 
their University against politics.
"The Consensus last semester was 
that [the resolution] was the right 
thing to do. Now, I would say it's 
closer to fifty-fifty. "
—Chris Neighbor; Senate Chair
Chris Neighbor, Senate Chair 
says, “The consensus last semes­
ter was that [the resolution] was 
the right thing to do. Now, I 
would say it’s closer to fifty-fifty.”
The University itself, says 
Neighbor, is in a difficult posi­
tion, with little or no pull on 
policy crafted by the govern­
ment. “Letters have been writ-
ten to the Defense Department 
and the President, but CMU still 
feels that it is easier to change 
from within the program than 
from [the outside],” says Neigh­
bor.
However, change to the Sen­
ate resolution may come hard, if 
at all. If the referendum passes, 
and student opinion supports the 
repeal of the ROTC resolution, 
Senate action may amount to 
nothing more than sending let­
ters to CMU students acknowl­
edging that fact. Oppositely, the 
results of a student poll demon-
strating a majority in support of 
the November Senate resolution 
calling for the dismissal of ROTC 
by 1995-96 will simply be con­
veyed to administration adding, 
says Neighbor, “to the over­
whelming paperwork we have 
already sent them.”
Past referendums have also 
shown that Senate can expect 
voter turnout to amount to noth­
ing over 10 percent of the stu­
dent body. Neighbor feels that 
any definitive moves will have 
to be undertaken by Faculty

ANALYSIS
"Sex Week is just to promote sexual 
awareness to students on campus." 
—Brenda Burke, Sophomore, CIT
By ERIN GRUNZKE
Tartan Staffwriter
The Student Dormitory Coun­
cil is sponsoring the second an­
nual Sex Week this week. Sex 
Week is a collection of programs 
presented by a variety of organi­
zations including the Student 
Dormitory Council (SDC), 
cmuOUT, the Inter-Varsity 
Christian Fellowship (IVCF), 
and the Housing Office.
There are two primary goals 
for Sex Week. The first is to 
address topics concerning sexu­
ality from a number of different 
aspects, such as relationships, 
personal needs, and healthy be­
havior. The second goal is to
present thought-provoking, in­
teractive, and fun programs for 
the campus community. As SDC 
Programming Chair Brenda 
Burke said, “Sex Week is just to 
promote sexual awareness to 
students on campus.”
The idea of having a Sex Week 
at Carnegie Mellon originated 
from the National Affiliation of 
Academic Conferences, a con­
ference attended annually by
members of SDC annually. The 
conference gives groups like SDC 
the opportunity to share and 
learn about diversity issues, 
public relations, and programs 
on other campuses. An estimated 
60—65 other universities and 
colleges including Bucknell, 
Penn State University, Hiram 
College, Rutgers, and Miami 
University have made Sex Week

The Beaux Arts Ball, a tradition of 
CFA since the early 1920s, has been 
postponed from this semester until 
spring 1993 due to scheduling conflicts 
within the college. “It was never can­
celled,” said senior art major Lizzie 
Mogel, who is on the Public Relations 
Committee for Beaux Arts, concerning 
the recent rumor regarding the popu­
lar event. “We just couldn’t get a date 
on the calendar that was free for every­
one,” she explains.
Committee heads considered the pos­
sibility of scheduling the Ball on March 
20, but decided against planning such a
trpTnendous undertaking for the day before spring break. Dean of the Col­
lege of Fine Arts D. Lowry Burgess, 
who has been very supportive of Beaux 
Arts, has agreed to set a definite date 
for the Beaux Arts next year. The only 
setback to this decision lies within run­
ning next year’s Ball, for approximately 
three-quarters of the students working 
on the project this year are seniors. 
Many seniors however, tentatively plan 
to return for the event.
This year’s organizers are trying to 
make the giant masquerade ball a bi­
annual tradition rather than an event 
that takes place every four years. Mogel 
explains that “there has to be a con-

U.S. may aid Soviet immigrants to Israel
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (DJ) — Ex­
isting U.S. international accounts may 
have room to finance a scaled-back hous­
ing loan guarantee program to help 
Israel absorb the thousands of Jewish 
immigrants streaming out of the former 
Soviet Union.
The Congressional Budget Office 
(CBO) highlighted the possibility in a 
budget analysis published this week, 
noting that it arises from fiscal maneu­
vering last fall over foreign aid spend­
ing priorities.
Without agreement on a foreign aid 
spending bill for fiscal 1992, which be­
gan last October, Congress passed a 
stop-gap measure before leaving town 
that carried international spending 
through March 31 at about 1991 levels.
CBO assumes these levels will con­
tinue through the end of the current
fiscal year, a development that would 
put international accounts in fiscal 1993 
$400 million below the spending caps 
now set by law.
“This difference,” CBO said, “provides 
leeway for the housing loan guarantees 
requested by Israel, whose consider­
ation was deferred until 1992 at the 
President’s request.”
Under the U.S. fiscal regimen, a por­
tion of any credit guarantee ranging 
generally from five percent to ten per­
cent — must be held in the budget in 
the event the U. S. is ever called to make 
good on it.
The potential cushion in fiscal 1993 
would back guarantees for Israel of $2 
billion or more, congressional sources 
said, in line with what is favored by 
Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont demo­
crat who chairs the Senate Appropria­
tions Subcommittee on Foreign Opera­
tions.
Israel originally asked for $10 bil­
lion, although Israeli Ambassador 
Zalman Shoval is reportedly willing to 
accept less. Leahy met yesterday with 
Shoval to discuss the guarantees. The 
ambassador is scheduled to meet today 
with Secretary of State James Baker.
“We’re not going to have a $10 billion 
package this year,” Leahy said. “We 
ought to be able to look at this from 
year-to-year. Otherwise, you don’t have 
the ‘carrot and stick’ I’d like to see.”
Leahy favors making the guarantees 
contingent on Israeli economic reforms 
sufficient to ensure repayment of the 
credits, and on Israel reducing housing 
spending in its occupied territories by 
an amount equal to any U.S. guaran­
tee.
The added cushion would likely 
sharpen focus on the issue of Israeli 
settlements in the territories — op­
posed by Baker out of a concern that 
they undermine the Middle East peace 
process — while easing differences 
among the U.S. lawmakers who 
squabble annually over priorities in 
the relatively small international bud­
get.
Such a cushion may also open the 
way for higher guarantees than now 
favored by Leahy, said Joseph White, 
an appropriations analyst for the 
Brookings Institution.
“If indeed it is true,” White said, “the 
significance is that it makes it rather 
more difficult for Senator Leahy to ar­
gue that we can only provide $2 billion 
this year and not provide a larger 
amount up front.
“Part of the argument for not provid- 
ing the full $10 billion was that there 
are budget restraints,” White contin- 
ued.
“If there is additional money some­
where, it would certainly reduce or 
eliminate one of the reasons for not 
providing the credits.” .i
Leahy, in an interview with Dow7 
Jones, said many unknowns loom over'" 
the U.S. foreign aid budget, including'1 
how much humanitarian assistance 
should be directed to the former Soviet 
Union.
President George Bush this week 
proposed to send the Soviet republics1' 
$645 million, some of which could come 
from defense savings, but also from any
cushion found in international accounts.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Leahy 
said.
Bush planning new Japaneasing restrictions
economic regulations
on U.S. computer suppliers
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (DJ) — In his three 
years in office, President George Bush has been 
turning into the Reregulation President. Now 
Bush plans to impose a sweeping 90-day ban on 
new regulation as part of the economic recovery 
plan he’ll unveil in his State of the Union address 
next week.
The regulatory moratorium will affect nearly 
every federal agency, White House officials say, 
including those responsible for the environment, 
finance, food, safety, transportation, labor, and 
communications.
During the three-month ban, agencies will be 
ordered to review all their regulations, particu­
larly new proposals, with an eye toward either 
scrapping rules that unduly burden business or 
slashing their costs.
The moratorium is a page borrowed from Ro­
nald Reagan’s book of tricks. Shortly after taking 
office in 1981, Reagan ordered a two-month ban 
on new regulations. The ban clearly set the tone 
for his administration.
But there’s a difference: Reagan’s ban was aimed 
at regulations developed during the democratic 
Carter administration. Bush is declaring war on 
his own team.
Bush has been president for the past three 
years, in which he rarely pushed for deregulation, 
and vice president and deregulation chief for 
eight years before that. The regulations being 
halted are Bush regulations. The agency heads 
implicitly being reprimanded are Bush appoin­
tees. He and his top aides lobbied hard for the two 
most costly pieces of legislation for business dur­
ing the past four years: the Clean Air Act, which 
imposed a regulatory burden on business esti­
mated at $25 billion a year, and the Americans 
with Disabilities Act, with a $2 billion annual 
price tag.
“It’s the vision thing,” says Robert Hahn, an 
economist who worked in the Bush administra­
tion on the Clean Air Act. “How do you get away 
from the fact that you’re the people who brought 
all this [regulation]? That’s a toughie.”
“For Bush, in the winter of ’92, to say that I 
didn’t mean [to add regulation] or I let it get out of 
hand is rather strange,” agrees William Niskanen, 
a Reagan administration economic adviser who 
now heads the libertarian Cato Institute.
Niskanen says administration officials asked 
him to write articles praising a moratorium, but 
he turned them down because he couldn’t “make 
much sense” out of the Bush proposal.
He adds that a colleague was also asked to write 
in favor of the moratorium, but said no, too.
Michael Boskin, chairman of the president’s 
Council of Economic advisers, and one of the 
architects of the moratorium, defends the plan. 
“It’s a way of focusing the attention of the regula­
tory community to redouble their efforts to pare 
costly regulation,” he says.
But it’s unclear how far-reaching the ban will 
be, in practice. The ban won’t affect rules which 
must be imposed to meet deadlines set by Con­
gress. Agencies also won’t hold up “emergency” 
regulations, such as Federal Drug Administra­
tion approval of new drugs, White House officials 
promise.
So-called independent agencies, such as the 
Federal Communications Commission and Secu­
rities and Exchange Commission, would also have 
to “voluntarily” agree to join in the moratorium.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (DJ)
— Japan agreed to curb the 
anticompetitive practices of its 
computer industry and allow 
U.S. suppliers abetter chance of 
landing public-sector contracts 
for computers and computing 
services.
The accord, whose outlines 
were announced in Tokyo dur­
ing President Bush’s recent visit, 
was officiated in an exchange of 
letters between Trade Represen­
tative Carla Hills and Ambassa­
dor Ryohei Murata of Japan.
Hills said that if U.S. industry 
estimates hold true, U.S. sales
in that hard-to-crack market 
could rapidly expand from $3.5 
billion to $5.5 billion by 1995. 
Currently, the sales of U.S. ven­
dors to Japanese public agen­
cies average $500 million a year.
The agreement bars Japanese 
suppliers from entering unrea­
sonably low bids with the inten­
tion of preventing foreign ven­
dors from landing government 
contracts. The agreement also 
provides for clearer bidding pro­
cedures.
Unlike Japan’s unofficial 
pledges to increase its purchases 
of U.S. cars and auto parts, the
computer agreement is a “bind-, 
ing” one between the two gov­
ernments, Hills said. “We would 
immediately file a trade action* 
if there were a problem,” she 
added.
The accord will take effect on 
April 1 for measures relating to 
computers and on Oct.l and 
April 1,1993 for various catego-! 
ries of computer services. U.S. 
industry analysts estimate the 
Japanese public-sector market) 
to be $9 billion a year. And they 
forecast that by 1995, that mar­
ket could generate as much as 
$15.8 billion in sales.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (AP)
— In its first strike at the de­
fense budget since the collapse 
of the Soviet Union, the Bush 
administration is proposing cuts 
of about $4 billion from military 
programs.
The preliminary list targets 
such items as upgrading the M- 
1 tank, work on the F-l 4 Tomcat 
jet fighter and millions of dol­
lars earmarked for research at 
colleges and universities across 
the country.
The list, first reported in 
Friday’s Washington Post and 
later obtained by Associated 
Press, is an early draft.
However, the list also includes
$143 million to upgrade the F- 
14 jet fighter, a program the 
Pentagon has tried to end over 
the objections of several mem­
bers of Congress, especially law­
makers from New York where 
the Navy aircraft is manufac­
tured.
Lawmakers often tack on to 
the defense budget funds for 
schools in their home districts. 
The Pentagon is calling for cut­
ting back millions of this added- 
on money.
Notably absent from the list is 
the V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor 
aircraft manufactured in Texas 
and Pennsylvania.
Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney has tried for several 
years to kill the program, but 
Congress has repeatedly added 
money for the Marine Corps 
plane.
Pentagon officials were meet­
ing today to decide whether to 
include money for the V-22 on 
the final list, according to con­
gressional sources.
If the House and Senate fail to 
act on the final recession list 
within 45 days, the money goes 
back to the Treasury.

Student Senate Chair Chris Neigh­
bor has been working with University 
0f Pittsburgh’s Student Government 
goard and Duquesne University’s Stu­
dent President to combine the shuttle 
services of the three universities. 
Though the plan is still in the develop­
ment stage, Neighbor said, “If every­
thing goes well, it could happen as 
early as this semester on a trial basis.”
According to Neighbor, the next step 
¡n the process will be is to contact the 
various security departments who are 
in charge of the shuttles. He hopes to 
meet with representatives from Pitt 
and Duquesne sometime this month.
Neighbor believes the initial step 
would be to set up common points along 
the three shuttle runs. Any student 
with ID could be picked up at any of 
those stops.There are obstacles to overcome first. These include potential insurance prob­lems, and the fact that the universities do not offer equivalent shuttle service. “There are a lot issues to be dealt with,” 
said Neighbor.
Pitt’s shuttle only takes students to 
and from their upper and lower cam­
puses. Duquesne’s shuttle takes stu­
dents from downtown to Morewood Av­
enue;
One of the biggest discussions con- c6rns whether Carnegie Mellon stu-

well, it could happen

mester on a trial ba­

dents will benefit from the proposed 
expansion, since Pitt’s shuttle service 
is concentrated in Oakland. Most areas 
accessed by Pitt’s shuttle are within a 
reasonable walking distance from 
CMU.
Although the committee has not yet 
looked at costs, the only apparent draw­
back, according to Neighbor, is the pos­
sibility of increased ridership on CMU’s 
shuttle. Carnegie Mellon’s shuttle takes 
riders to local shopping districts and 
other off-campus spots. “There’s a lot of 
appeal for them [Pitt and Duquesne 
studentsl to use our service,” Neighbor 
said.
A major benefit especially for CMU 
students would be drop-off points in 
Oakland and the downtown area be­
sides Pitt’s and Duquesne’s campuses. 
This would greatly increase students’
access to these areas.
Neighbor also said that Senate is 
working are working on a way to have 
the shuttles pick people up and bring
them to campus. Pitt has recently 
started a program like this.
The three schools will continue fine- 
tune to this idea and will start to work
on the details of the plan. As Neighbor 
said, “It would be nice to get a little 
more interaction between the universi­
ties.”

ID thieves placed on 
probation
The October 1990 theft of the ID machine and necessary supplies 
from Warner Hall, which resulted in all faculty, staff, and student 
ID cards being re-encoded, has come before the Allegheny County 
Criminal Court System.
The two former Carnegie Mellon students whole stole the equip­
ment have been placed in a probation program and have both 
agreed to pay a restitution of $5,534 to the University. Because they 
are first- time offenders, the former students’ records will be wiped 
clean if they successfully complete their probation period.
Design Department begins 
mentor program
The Design Department recently, introduced a mentor program 
for its graphic design students to allow students and professionals 
to work together on a one-on-one basis over a two-year period. The 
mentors, some of whom are Carnegie Mellon alumni, serve as 
friend, advisor, and teacher to the students to help nurture their 
professional and social development.
This newest addition to the host of mentor programs sponsored 
throughout the University has the potential to be the best student/ 
department/alumni relations program in existence.
CMU to participate in TQM 
University Challenge
Carnegie Mellon has been selected to participate in a new joint 
educational effort, the Total Quality Management (TQM) Univer­
sity Challenge. The program pairs educational institutions with 
corporate sponsors who will introduce them to TQM principles and 
concepts.
Carnegie Mellon’s corporate sponsor is Xerox. Motorola, Proctor 
& Gamble, Milliken, and IBM have also agreed to participate in the 
program with other universities. The other schools participating in 
the TQM University Challenge are Purdue University, University 
of Wisconsin at Madison, Tuskegee University, North Carolina 
State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, and Rochester Institute of Technology.
Administrators and faculty members of Carnegie Mellon will 
receive a week ofTQM training at Xerox facilities in late spring. The 
University will then implement TQM activities, including a focused 
customer survey and an internal assessment of TQM integration 
capabilities.
New international 
scholarships announced
The National Security Education Act of 1991, authored by Sena­
tor David L. Boren (D-OK), was signed into law by President Bush
on January 15, creating the largest new higher education program 
of its kind since the National Defense Education Act of 1958.
Under Boren’s program, college students can be selected ; 
“International Exchange Scholars” and will receive scholarships to i 
study abroad for one or two semesters. Priority will be given to 
students going to countries not emphasized in other U.S. study 
abroad programs, such as Africa, South America, and Asia.
Graduate students will also be able to receive fellowships to study 
foreign languages and area studies through the program. They will i 
be required to teach or work for a government agency for one toi 
three years for every year the fellowship is provided.
Summer Leadership 
Institute begins second year
The Summer Leadership Institute, sponsored by Student Affairs, 
is accepting applications for its second, year. The Institute is a 10- 
week internship -with a 20-module program core. Two two-hour 
workshop meetings, which focus on aspects of both personal and 
professional development, are held each week. Last summer, in- i 
terns represented each college within the University and included 
both undergraduates and recent graduates.
Applications for the Summer Leadership Institute can be picked; 
up in the Student Affairs Office, WH 208. The deadline for comple- j 
tion is February 17.

Sexual harassment strikes Andrew system
SEXUAL HARASSMENT, from page 1.
“personal attacks.” Jefferson said, “I 
don’t think they were offensive,” and 
believes he didn’t break the sexual ha­
rassment policy. “The way [the sexual 
harassment policyl is defined in the 
student handbook is really vague,” said 
Jefferson.
However, Knauer believes that 
Jefferson crossed the line of free speech. 
Knauer said, “The administration 
should say, ‘Look, what you wrote is 
breaking the rules, whether they are 
right or not, and don’t do it again.’ ”
This happened on January 22 when the assistant dean of student affairs told Jefferson that if he continued to post his questionable messages a full 
disciplinary committee would make a 
ruling on his actions which could ulti­
mately result in the expulsion of Jefferson from Carnegie Mellon. “I told her that I couldn’t promise not to post 
any more messages,” said Jefferson.
Masco believes Jefferson’s messages 
are a “clear case of harassment” and 
believes Jefferson’s intent was to start an argument among the members of 
the Women’s Center. “I don’t see how it can be possible for any of his comments not to be taken as harassment,” said 
Masco.
The sexual harassment policy states,
“Carnegie Mellon University seeks to 
maintain a learning and work environ­
ment free from sexual harassment. 
Carnegie Mellon is dedicated to the 
free exchange of ideas and the intellec­
tual development of all members of the 
community. For this exchange and de­
velopment to take place, the environ­
ment must promote the confidence to 
work, to study, to innovate, and to per­
form without fear of harassment.”
The policy continues, “Carnegie Mel­
lon University adopts the basic defini­
tion of the Equal Employment Oppor­
tunity Commission (EEOC) regarding 
sexual harassment as any unwelcome 
sexual advance, requests for sexual fa­
vors, or other verbal or physical con­
duct of a sexual nature when ... such 
conduct has the purpose or effect of 
unreasonable interfering with an 
individual’s work performance, or cre­
ating an intimidating, hostile, or offen­
sive work environment.”
Masco agrees with J efferson that that 
policy is weakly worded, but he doesn’t 
see that as grounds for altering the 
policy. “It gives [the administration] 
the ability to act reasonably rather than 
tying themselves down to a specific 
course of action,” said Masco.
Alleged acts of harassment have oc­
curred almost monthly over the past
few years and are handled by the Office 
of Student Affairs. According to Dean 
Murphy, data gathering and communi­
cation are the first steps in alleviating 
any harassment case. “There is a con­
siderable amount of discussion on what 
constitutes harassment,” said Murphey. 
If no solution can be agreed upon, the 
University committee on discipline is 
called upon to decide what actions 
should be taken.
The committee on discipline is com­
prised of two faculty members and two 
students. This committee has the power 
to take any action against CMU stu­
dents who violate university policies, 
including administering fines, commu­
nity service, suspension, or expulsion.
The free speech and assembly policy 
states, “Carnegie Mellon University ... 
encourages freedom of speech, assem­
bly, and exchange of ideas. This in­
cludes the distribution of leaflets and 
petitions, as well as demonstrations or 
protests involving speaking, discussion, 
or the distribution of information.”
“All persons are permitted to distrib­
ute printed material, offer petitions for 
signature, make speeches and conduct 
other similar activities outside univer­
sity buildings.... The only limits on these 
activities are the rights of the members 
of the university community and the
"Carnegie Mellon University... encourages 
freedom of speech, assembly, and exchange 
of ideas"—Carnegie Mellon free speech 
and assembly policy
maintenance ofthe normal functioning 
of the university. No activities which 
harm individuals, damage or deface 
property, block access to university 
buildings, or disrupt classes will be 
permitted.”
Murphy sees the harassment policy 
as a way of guaranteeing everyone the 
right of free expression, since it pre­
vents people from harassing others to 
the point that they are in fear of speak­
ing out. “Everyone in the campus com­
munity is free to express themselves 
openly,” said Murphy.
Murphy also pointed out that the 
way in which something is said makes 
a difference in the way a message is 
received. For example, a racial joke on 
a joke board may be considered crude 
and uncomfortable, but if the joke is on 
a board aimed for that group of people, 
it can be taken as offensive or even
harassing. “That is a very threatening 
thing,” said Murphy.
Murphy calls upon the University 
committee on discipline only as a last 
resort, first relying on communication 
between the office of student affairs 
and the parties involved. According to 
Murphy, formal action is not taken in 
any case without the consent of those 
who issued the complaint.
Harassment over the Andrew system 
has occurred in a number of ways. These 
include offensive messages on Bboards 
and explicit photographs on the screen. 
However, the Office of Student Affairs 
has not had to deal with the problem on 
a frequent basis. “We’ve been very for­
tunate that these instances have been 
very rare,” said Murphy.
Administration officials hope that 
their methods of dealing with the prob: 
lem assist in preventing future cases.
Is it harassment? 
You be the judge
Here are a few cases which may serve to illustrate some of 
the subtleties involved in considering whether a situation 
comprises harassment. These are case studies developed from 
materials pulled together from various sources and not encap­
sulations of past cases at CMU. There should be no conclusion 
that any or all of these are harassment. Rather, these should 
be interesting to consider as to whether you think the case is 
definitely, is probably, is possibly, or is definitely not harass­
ment.

ethnic comments and slurs to

ROTC resolution challenged
ROTC, from page 1.
Senate which has passed a simi­
lar resolution requesting thay 
the University investigate the 
question of discrimination in 
ROTC.
Matt Woodhead, a freshman 
IM Senator in ROTC, comments, 
“The Senate resolution is di­
rected the wrong way. If you 
want change, you have to talk to 
those with the power to change. 
It’s the civilians who make the 
policy who have control, not the 
University.” Chris Wood, the 
ROTC resolution’s author, dis­
agrees. “If the administration 
takes a stand, it will have an 
effect. If we have no power to 
change the policy, that’s fine, 
but we don’t have to tolerate it 
on campus.”
The controversy, for those who 
hold vested interests, is one de­
fined by mixed feelings. While 
ROTC does not dole money out 
to gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, 
it does allow them to attend its 
classes and participate in its pro­
grams. This, says some, makes 
the military program no differ­
ent than any other scholarship

open to only qualified applicants. 
Mooney says, “ROTC has its own 
buildings and money to give. It 
is their right to create require­
ments, and their program is no 
different than any NAACP or 
Women Engineer scholarship.”
Further obscuring a clear so­
lution is the question concern­
ing the effect the removal of the 
ROTC program could have on 
Carnegie Mellon. Many students 
in the program can attend Car­
negie Mellon only because they 
have ROTC scholarships.
Mooney, who would like to see 
the resolution repealed com­
pletely, said, “[The removal] of 
ROTC could be nothing but det­
rimental to the University as a 
whole. Students in the program 
are also active, contributing 
members of the University.” 
“Yes, it is University hypoc­
risy,” says Neighbor, “but if I 
was in administration’s position,
I would do the same. ROTC al­
lows highly qualified students 
to attend without charge to the 
university; and a lot of schools 
are scrambling for the kind of 
students ROTC allows to attend 
Carnegie Mellon.” For some, 
however, the benefits do not out­
weigh the cost. “We can’t justify 
discrimination by saying we get 
a bigger student pool,” says 
Wood.
Controversy has also spilled 
over into Student Senate. Be­
fore the referendum can be or­
ganized, Senate constitution 
calls for a week to verify the; 
results of the petition. Senate; 
members have begun to ques-! 
tion the legality of the petition’s! 
wording and are, says Mooney,! 
using inefficient methods to1 
verify the signatures. “Student; 
Senate seems to be doing any-; 
thing they can to slow things; 
down,” says Mooney.
Those who support the re-! 
moval of ROTC if the restric­
tions remain intact are com­
pelled by the notion that the 
questions raised can be nothing 
but beneficial.
Wood said, “Ifthe administra-, 
tion takes a leadership role, we; 
can get through the changes! 
more quickly. If every school! 
takes action the Defense Depart-! 
ment will listen.” Mooney, judg-! 
ingfrom the number of si udents- 
who signed the petition, says,; 
“The resolution is basically; 
wrong. The campus community; 
as a whole wants to see an ROTC; 
program.”

American Institute of Architecture 
Students sponsors Nouveau Ball
By MIKE KUNSMANN
Tàrtan Staffwriter
frhe American Institute of Ar­
chitecture Students (AIAS) is 
sponsoring the first annual Ar­
chitecture Ball, the Art Nouveau 
extravaganza at the Metropol 
04 February 10. The Art 
Nouveau Ball replaces the post­
poned Beaux Arts Ball which 
couldn’t take place due to orga­
nizational problems. The event 
commences at 7 pm and the party 
won’t end until two in the morn­
ing.
According to the AIAS, all stu­
dents are welcome regardless of 
department affiliation, but the 
Ball will mainly be a social event, 
so the architects, who are spon­
soring the ball, can mingle.
Cocktails and hors d’oeuvres 
wijll be served throughout the 
night and besides a DJ there 
will be two bands playing for the 
night’s entertainment. The 
groups are The Deli Bandits and 
Boogieman Smash.
“It’s kind of a costume ball,” 
says Christine Nalecki, Presi­
dent of AIAS. She also says there 
will be a costume competition 
which will be judged by the fac­
ulty of the Architecture Depart­
ment who attend the ball. Diana 
Nicholas, vice president of AIAS 
says that this does not mean 
everybody must dress up, though 
if they wish, people can wear 
formal or even semi-formal cloth­
ing. It also doesn’t matter if 
would-be attendees can't find 
dates, because “most people I 
know are going stag. It’s just 
like a big party,” says Nicholas.
There will be a door prize of 
either cash or a gift, and for 
those who are over 21 a cash bar 
will be supplied.
“We felt we needed a social 
event to bring [the architecture 
students] closer together,” says 
Nalecki. One of the problems 
in the Architecture Department 
is that there is little communi­
cation between the freshmen 
architects in Doherty Hall, the
“We felt we needed a social event to 
bring [the architecture students] 
closer together,”

second- and third-year students 
in Margaret Morrison and the 
upperclassmen in CFA. “This 
ball is a good opportunity for the 
freshmen to party and get to 
know other architects,” says 
Julie Chiu, fourth year archi­
tect and ball committee mem­
ber.
This ball could become an an­
nual event if the turnout is good, 
says Nalecki, but in order for the 
dance to be held, 200 tickets 
must be sold. As of now only 
about one hundred tickets have 
been purchased, so it would be 
wise for anyone who wants to 
attend the Art Nouveau Ball to
think about parting with the $15 
per ticket as soon as possible. 
Chiu says tickets will be sold 
until Wednesday, and by that 
time the committee will have 
decided whether the dance can 
be held or not.
As for transportation, Nalecki 
says they will not provide it since 
Metropol is close by and split­
ting a cab is fairly cheap. Those 
who don’t know where the 
Metropol is can look at any Pitts­
burgh newspaper or try finding 
1600 Smallman Avenue on the 
city map.
“It will be better than working 
in studio that night,” said Chiu.

part of their annual agendas. The 
conference supplies the campus rep­
resentatives with ideas encompass­
ing every aspect of Sex Week from 
postering, games, and lecturers, to 
interesting and informative events 
and programs.
SDC has scheduled a wide variety 
of events. One of the planned activi­
ties includes a Sex Bowl trivia con­
test where teams of five people from 
different colleges vie to answer sex- 
related questions. Other events in­
clude presentations by lecturers from 
the University of Pittsburgh and the 
Interfaith Council. The lectures are 
sponsored by the IVCF, and the 
Thursday and Friday night films 
are presented by cmuOUT.
SDC has also scheduled a number 
of entertainers, including a profes­
sional masseuse to give tips on giv­
ing better massages. On Saturday 
the Club Xes dance will take place in
the Wherrett Room. The live D.J. 
and the chance to win one of twelve 
$25 gift certificates to one of 
Pittsburgh’s great restaurants will 
close an informative week.
Sex Week 1992 will differ from its 
predecessor by focussing on relation­
ships and the different perspectives 
of sexual life. Sex Week will repre­
sent all sexual preferences. SDC has 
placed particular emphasis on using 
innovative means to tackle taboo or 
embarrassing sexual issues. Ex­
amples include the Purity Test which 
will be given on Tuesday in the 
Donner Hall reading room, and the 
Love, Sex, and Sundaes discussion 
which will also take place in Donner. 
Sex Week T-Shirts can be purchased 
at all of the Sex Week activities. As 
Burke said, “It is coming together 
really well. Thanks to the help of

FORUM
E-mail harassment 
threatens us all
When we arrive at this uni­
versity, we gain immediate ac­
cess to Andrew accounts which, 
among other things, allow us to 
send electronic mail to friends, 
faculty, group organizations, and 
people at other colleges, and al­
low us to post messages on elec­
tronic bulletin boards. Bboards 
are quite popular and have 
served as an excellent means for 
sharing common ideas and ex­
pressing new ones.
From time to time, individu­
als abuse the privilege of using 
the networks by posting racist, 
prejudicial, or sexually harass­
ing messages on bboards.
Bboards allow us to commu­
nicate quickly and efficiently. 
They also provide a forum for 
expressing our opinions. How­
ever, there is no place on the 
bboards for so-called hate speech, 
which is nothing but counter­
productive. This is a community 
in which we value the ability to 
speak freely, exploring new 
points of view and broadening 
our own intellectual experiences. 
At the same time, however, re­
spect for one another is tanta­
mount to learning and growth 
for everyone. Expressing opin­
ions is one thing — harassment 
and deliberately offensive lan­
guage is something else.
At this point we should men­
tion “flaming.” Flames are in­
sults and inflammatory language 
specifically designed to make oth­
ers angry. Avid bboard users tend
to find them amusing.
Flaming has its place — the 
bboard cmu.opinion, for example, 
which exists so people can ex­
press opinions and discuss them 
or, as the case may be, have flame 
w irs over them. Bboards such as 
cmu.market or assocs.women’s- 
center, on the other hand, are 
not the place for flames, as they 
were created only for announce­
ments, not discussion of any kind.
And even when flaming, ev­
ery bboard user should set limits 
for him- or herself. Harassment 
is harassment, no matter what 
the forum.
If you feel that you have been 
harassed by email or a bboard 
post, you can take official action. 
A complaint sent to advisor+ 
@andrew is enough to launch an 
investigation of the incident, po­
tentially resulting in punitive 
action against the offender.
Taking matters into your own 
hands often causes more prob­
lems than it solves. It can give 
the offender more attention than 
he or she deserves, and cause 
further problems for you. Go di­
rectly to the authorities—that’s 
what they’re there for.
Bboards provide a unique op­
portunity for communication and 
opinion exchange, often with 
people you would never other­
wise meet. Every Andrew user 
has a responsibility, however, to 
police him- or herself and keep 
posts appropriate.
Sex Week offers 
friendly advice
Sex Week, SDC’s annual at­
tempt to promote sexual aware­
ness throughout the campus com- 
m unitv. has arrived once again. 
With help from cmuOUT, Inter- 
Varsity Christian Fellowship, 
and the Housing Office, Sex Week 
provides a variety of programs 
on sex-related topics and offers a 
chance for important dialogue 
: on issues of widespread concern.
In this age of sexual upheaval, 
Sex Week is a good time to im­
prove campus awareness about 
topics such as AIDS, sexually 
transmitted diseases (STDs), and 
sexuality.
The combined efforts of the 
organizations involved signify 
the importance of these issues to 
college communities and to soci­
ety in general.
The college years are often a 
time for experimentation and 
reckless behavior. In an age when 
careless sexual activity is more 
dangerous than eS'er, students 
need to be especially aware of 
the subjects Sex Week addresses.
Now, more than at any other 
time, we all have a responsibility 
to get the facts and to act intelli­
gently based on that knowledge. 
Sex is no longer something that 
can be ignored, even by the most. 
prudish or polite of societies.
The threat of irresponsible 
sexual activity is no longer preg­
nancy or treatable venereal dis-

ease — the threat is death.
Sex Week allows multiple 
points of view to be taken up 
regarding the status of sexuality 
in our society. By drawing atten­
tion to all possibilities, from ab­
stinence to methods of protec­
tion to safer alternatives for high- 
risk behaviors, the programs of­
fer realistic options to those who 
might be considering sexual ac­
tivity or are already sexually 
active.
We understand that some of 
the tension surrounding Sex 
Week and other controversial 
events results from the concern 
that they might promote sexual 
activity among the students on 
this, or any other, campus.
On the other hand, it’s a fact 
that many people of college age 
are sexually active, with or with­
out Sex Week. The information 
offered during Sex Week is cru­
cial to their well-being and abil­
ity to make an informed decision 
concerning sexuality and sexual 
activity.
While much of the approach 
to Sex Week is light-hearted, the 
subjects the programs intend to 
tackle are very serious.
We see this upcoming week 
as the time for learning, not only 
about the facts and alternatives, 
but about ourselves, our atti­
tudes, and our concerns.
Editor:
Welcome back! I 
hope all of you had 
an enjoyable break. I 
would like to take 
this opportunity to 
detail the progress of some Student 
Government initiatives.
The pilot operation of the Student 
Mentor program proved to be invalu­
able. We will certainly build on the 
learnings. I thank all of the partici­
pants for their contribution.
Despite some glitches, the program 
has great potential. It will take some 
time and a lot of hard work if om all of 
us, but I am confident that it will even­
tually become a natural part of the 
Carnegie Mellon University ex­
perience.
Further, I would like to draw your 
attention to the first of this semester’s 
Gathering Storr series. This program 
is intended to provide students, fac­
ulty, and staff the time and place to 
engage in constructive discussions. It 
. will feature cheating and competition

and will take place this Wednesday at 
4:30 pm in the Wherrett Room. I en­
courage all of you to attend. It should be 
very interesting.
Last semester, an Academic Plan­
ning Fair idea was mentioned. This is 
the program which will feature various 
academic departments to make aca­
demic information available to stu­
dents.
We have decided to work on the plan­
ning aspect this term and implement 
the program next year rather than 
launch the fair this semester as origi­
nally planned.
This should give us ample time to 
thoroughly plan and gain support from 
departments which, in turn, will en­
sure its success.
Finally, I want to share with you 
some information about the Pittsburgh 
Horizons program sponsored by Stu­
dent Affairs. This great program offers 
students opportunities to explore Pitts­
burgh at a minimal cost.
Of particular interest to you may be 
the University Night at the Symphony 
on February 19. Additional informa­
tion can be obtained at Skibo Informa­
tion Desk or by calling Kelly Walter.
As always, if you have any comments, 
please contact me at x5391 or through 
campus-mail to Student Government 
President’s Box, Skibo. Good luck this 
semester.

There is a foul odor 
in the air around 
CMU. A disgusting 
odor which makes 
one cringe and gag. It 
comes from being fed the same PR spin 
for seven years.
The latest Tartan headline should 
only confirm for those who haven’t been 
living off the rhetoric coming down 
from Warner Hall that the fantastic 
new Student Center is plain fantasy. It 
is folly to think that we will ever have 
a student center. This campus has not 
seen one in its 25 years of existence. 
Why now, in the midst of a downward 
spiraling economy, with myopic lead­
ers at the helm of our fair state and 
university?
What leads me to this grim pessi­
mism? Just read between the lines of 
The Tartan article [“University Center 
construction postponed,”!. First, 
“fundraising for the $41 million project 
is not complete.” Well, this is the most 
damning piece of evidence which seals 
the fate of the University Center. If my 
memory serves me correctly, they 
lacked off this big capital fundraiser 
back in 1986 with a $200 million cam­
paign called “Campus Salutes Carn­
egie.” You know, all the big CMU al­
ums were paraded out to drum up gift 
giving. One of the projects which would 
supposedly benefit from this windfall 
was the University Center. NOT!
When a university which aspires to 
be in the same league as MIT can’t even 
raise a piddling $20 million to build a 
necessary and vital part of the campus 
community, it better rethink its posi­
tion in the academic world, fast. For 
the comparison, MIT is just about fin­
ished with a three-year, $750 million 
capital campaign (it started out as $500 
million, but they surpassed that mark 
in just two years, so they decided to go 
for the additional quarter billion).
Second, the final paragraph of the 
article is the final nail in the coffin. So 
our prescient planners in Warner Hall 
have found an alternative to the huge 
capital costs of building a new center: 
Buy another building and convert its 
space (which we already use to accom­
modate classroom assignment over­
flow) into the University activity space, 
and voila, it’s a new center! NOT, again! 
If the University buys this building 
before it can raise the needed $20 mil­
lion, you can kiss the Center goodbye.
And they wonder why alumni giving 
is so meager.

I’d like to address 
this letter t6 the en­
tire Carnegie Mellon 
community. In the 
past three weeks 
since enrollment (which I quite seri­
ously called the Seventh Semi-Annual 
Battle with the Registrar), I have been 
to dining services, the cashiei1, finan­
cial aid, the library, payroll, account­
ing, the shuttle service, and my depart­
ment office. The only place I left with 
the same blood pressure as I went in 
was my department office.
Today, I figured out why. Everyone i 
just seems to work here. No one is j 
willing to take responsibility for Carn­
egie Mellon University. No one will’; 
admit a mistake or try to change a 
mistaken policy.
I have encountered no less than five ; 
rude service workers; some ignored me 
while I waited at the counter, some said 
they couldn’t help me and didn’t ex­
plain why, and some said “Hey, I just 
work here.” Well, I am just working 
here too, but I try to help the people who 
ask me questions, and if I can’t help, I 
tell them where to go to find answers.
The I-just-work-here attitude has 
destroyed Carnegie Mellon 
University for me. If I knew three and 
a half years ago what I know now I 
would never have come to Carnegie 
Mellon.
Right now, I just want to get out, and 
I will never come back. I will never ; 
advise anyone to come to Carnegie ; 
Mellon University. And, I most cer­
tainly will never give money to Carn­
egie Mellon. . It isn’t the education that 
prevents Carnegie Mellon University 
from being number one in the nation; it 
is the lack of service.
This week when you come to work, 
try to smile, take responsiblity for your 
department, and have pride in what: 
you can accomplish.
Even the lowest person in a depart­
ment has to be part of a team that tries 
to be great. Total quality management 
at Carnegie Mellon has been a com­
plete flop to date.
It is going to take a concerted effort to 
get Carnegie Mellon University back 
on track and I’d like to see that happen 
soon. Carnegie Mellon will be a better 
place and a healthier place if people 
care; I guarantee it.

Holiday provokes consideration
/ Jason McDonald
The fact that I’m writing a 
column about Martin Luther 
King Jr.’s birthday a week after 
the fact is a) untimely, b) 
strange, and c) in its own way, 
the point of this week’s tirade. 
You see, in one of my fits of 
awkwardly benevolent narcis­
sism (meaning that I’m not a 
real asshole, just a little self­
involved at times), I decided 
that Martin Luther King Jr.’s 
birthday didn’t really matter.
Sure, I was upset that my 
brother, who goes to Pitt, had 
the day off and got to sleep in, 
but that was about it. No gran­
diose plans of working towards 
racial harmony — at least not 
at that time. I just wondered 
why I had to get up so early on
a day when I would be unable to 
cash a check.
Lunchtime changed my view 
a little. While I was whipping 
through stock Tartan Grill Meal 
#43 (cheeseburger, fries, and 
Coke), a woman approached me 
and asked if I wanted to sign a 
petition to have Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day be a class-free day 
at CMU next year.
My jaded side told me, “CMU 
has screwed you over enough in 
your three-and-a-half years 
here. Return the favor.”
The chance for payback isn’t 
why I ended up signing, though. 
I found myself struck by the fact 
that this woman cared enough 
about Martin Luther King Jr. to 
take the time from her own 
schedule to do this (she also had 
a partner whom I never saw). 
There was no organization back­
ing her in this effort; it was just 
that she thought it was the right 
thing to do.
I’m sure that your frantic 
search for a point has now be­
gun. Let me help. The point is 
not solely whether Martin 
Luther King Jr.’s birthday

guy wants to strip naked and 
howl at the moon, that’s his busi­

Do the CMU administration 
powers-that-be care though? By 
last Monday’s display, I guess 
not.
Sure, I was upset that my brother; who goes to Pitt, had 
the day off and got to sleep in, but that was about it. No

Sadly, that’s the way most 
people (including myself) tend 
to think about things. In this 
case, I don’t apologize for not 
celebrating Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day; it’s certainly my right to 
do that. I do, however, feel bad 
that I forgot that some people do

Rights guarantee 
too much to public
R. D. Quinn
In recent years the concept of “rights” 
has been applied to many different groups 
md many different situations. This ob­
session with rights has gone too far. It is 
;now being applied to any privilege or 
'government-supported service that a cer­
tain group demands — at any cost.
Aright, such as free speech or religion,
health care. This is a disturbing idea. 
How can a society guarantee a service 
which, economically, it cannot possibly 
support? The answer is that it cannot. 
For those who have no ability to help 
themselves, the government can help 
those in need with basic services. Put­
ting the country in a position of promis­
ing complete health care coverage as an 
absolute right for all would prove to be 
next to impossible.
I believe that a right grants an op­
portunity to do or believe certain things 
that will improve my life. It does not 
guarantee that I will be able to do those

health care as a right for alt Americans. Many

turbing idea.
gives individuals the opportunity to voice 
an opinion or to hold certain beliefs. What 
are now being passed off as rights are 
objectives which cannot be upheld by 
declaration or be enforced by mandate 
alone. It would be ideal if the fulfillment 
of all of our needs and desires could be 
guaranteed by the government, but there 
are limits to what any government is 
capable of doing.
The most recent fad is the call for 
national health care as a right for all 
Americans. Many of the candidates run­
ning for president are promising national
things, only that I have .the legal right 
to do them. Health car§, on the other 
hand; requires active economic contri­
bution by government to guarantee that 
health care will be available to all.
I don’t want to see people dying be­
cause they cannot afford medical care, 
but I don’t want our country to slip into, 
the pitfall of guaranteeing health care 
for all (remember, Communism tried 
that and failed). If we start associating 
basic needs with legal rights, the 
country’s resources will have to be used

Actions over logic 
pleases Star Trek fan
Chris Restifo
Star Trek: The Wimp Generation. 
That’s what the title should be. After all, 
why should the producers lie to us? This 
next generation garbage is nothing com­
pared to the old glory of Kirk and the 
gang.
Perhaps I’m just showing the nostal­
gia that my dad shows about old songs 
mutilated by commercials. I don’t claim 
to be a Trekkie or an expert, but there 
are too many people taking too much 
interest in this poor substitute for the 
real Star Trek.
Of course, the defenders of the wimp 
generation will be quick to point out that 
the late Gene Roddenberry was the driv­
ing force behind the new series. Gene 
was human like the rest of us, and even 
he could make a mistake.
The main difference between the wimp 
generation and real Star Trek is the fact 
that the wimps are more “intellectual.” 
Now, if I desired to analyze the depths of 
human existence and thought, Picard 
might do. However, when I’m watching 
a show about space, aliens, danger, and 
the unknown, I want action.
Here’s what I mean. In one episode of 
the kiddie generation, the Enterprise is 
hit by some weird cosmic space effect 
that damages the ship and puts it in 
danger. Up on the bridge, Chief O’Brien 
and Ensign Ro are pushing neato touch 
sensitive screens to avert almost inevi­
table danger. Oh, like, wow. How bor­
ing! In the real Star Trek, Scottie would 
have grabbed a wrench, a tricorder, a 
laser knife, and some bubble gum and 
gone down some tube filled with radia­
tion. Then, using good old Scottish know­
how and daring, he would have fixed the 
matter-anti-matter converter with his 
bare hands. Geordi can’t even compare 
with his 24th-century Gargoyle shades.
Naturally, all these dangerous things 
could be avoided if Picard would only 
get off his butt and start commanding 
the ship like a real captain. I remember 
one show particularly well. The Enter­
prise came upon another ship. When
Of course, the defend­
ers of the wimp gen­

Grading system produces disparity in results
Cjíu.'I—
John Funge
Let’s face it. Grades suck. 
They produce friction between 
a student and parents, profes­
sors, colleagues, and one’s self. 
These things that make the dif­
ference between Harvard and 
Jiffy Lube Tech confine us to a 
stressful and stifled learning 
environment... or maybe not.
Then , again, grades are great. 
They motivate students to work 
harder by giving them some­
thing to strive for. Grading 
stimulates competition which 
not only mirrors the'competi­
tion that students will be sub­
ject to in the “real world,” but 
also boosts achievement by ex­
ploiting interactive energy be­
tween students.
Now, whether you believe in 
grading or not, practicality dic­
tates that a student’s perfor­
mance must somehow be evalu­
ated. As a result we have grades. 
Yet, determining the “best” way 
t° grade is no easy task, and is 
What often spawns controversy.
However, no matter wK5t 
school of thought people sub­
scribe to, most would surely 
agree that fairness and accu­
racy are the basic elements that 
give grades meaning in the first 
place.
Obviously, no system can be 
completely fair and accurate. As 
a result, we can only strive to be 
as fair and accurate as possible. 
This is where my gripe lies. I 
can’t help but feel that CMU’s 
five-grade system (A, B, C, D, 
and R) is a less-than-best effort
that the five-grade system with 
pluses and minuses is the best, 
and here’s why.
The pass/fail system cannot 
distinguish between passing 
performance and exceptional 
performance. As a result, it 
should probably be reserved for 
situations where distinguishing 
between passing and exceptional ' 
performance is impossible, or 
does not apply. Classes like 
CSW, which I have been told has
hard on one’s morale. Remem­
ber the times when you just 
missed a grade while you barely 
squeak over the cutoff in an­
other class.
The 100-point (percentage) 
system fails because it offers 
the overkill resolution. Truly, is 
there any real performance dif­
ference between an 86 percent 
student and an 87 percent stu­
dent? Probably not. Therefore, 
the distinction is not all that
Obviously, no system can be completely fair and accu­
rate. As a result, we can only strive to be as fair and 
accurate as possible.
at fairness and accuracy.
From accuracy comes fairness. 
As a result, issues of accuracy 
are justifiably the focus of most 
debate. Four grading schemes 
seem to be predominant in 
American collegiate education: 
pass/fail, five-grade, five-grade 
with pluses and minuses, and a 
full 0-100 point scheme.
Obviously, there are excep­
tions, but the above four are the 
only realistic alternatives since 
further disparities arise when 
unconventional grades are stan­
dardized upon graduation.
Out of these choices, I suggest
been changed to pass/fail, fit well 
into this category.
Like the pass/fail system, our 
five-grade system does not offer 
enough resolution. There can be 
enormous differences in perfor­
mance within one grade. Yet, 
many would argue that accu­
racy arises from the fact that 
students will probably be on the 
lower half of a higher grade as 
often as they are on the upper 
half of a lower grade.
However, this never seems to 
happen. And even if this statis­
tical cancelling were accurate, 
the five-grade system can be
accurate. Also, the 100 point 
system becomes somewhat ri­
diculous when it is applied to 
situations where grading can­
not be very concrete, such as a 
musical performance.
The plus and minus system 
allows for thirteen different 
grades, assuming there is no 
such thing as an R+ or R-. Thir­
teen divisions, though probably 
still too many, gives professors 
and students greater flexibility 
by making grade cutoffs less 
painfully significant. Further­
more,’ pluses and minuses rep­
resent a compromise between
the five-grade system and the 
100-point system. Since many 
professors currently mix the 100- 
point system with our five-grade 
system by marking exams on a 
percentile basis and later as­
signing letter grades, a compro­
mise seems only natural.
What will be the fate of this 
issue, or is it an issue at all? I 
don’t know. Sure, Carnegie 
Mellon has many other bigger 
and glossier improvements to 
worry about (like Bernoulli Disk 
Drives and DEC Stations with 
CD players), but isn’t that al­
ways the case?
Obviously, if you’re one of 
those who consistently scrapes 
by a grade cutoff, you won’t be in 
favor of my proposed change. 
¦Who knows? What goes around 
comes around, and in the end, 
someone always gets screwed.
The inertia caused by the lo­
gistics involved with such a sys­
tem change will probably cause 
this to drown in Carnegie Mel­
lon University’s pool of apathy 
anyway.
Let’s go back to where I 
started. The way grading is done 
at CMU sucks.

provide these services, no mat­

are limits to what can be done 
with our resources, and these 
limits mandate that certain ob­

and what we deem to be a privi­

A PERSON’S
OPINION

CMU Shuttle Service only 
covers a limited area. Re­
cently, the idea of having 
various campuses combine 
their shuttle routes in order 
to give students a wider area 
of coverage has beeen sug­
gested. What do you think 
about Pitt, CMU, and 
Duquesne combining 
their shuttle services to 
give better service to stu­
dents?
Drew Snyder
Sophomore
Design
“Well, I think if they did it, it 
would make sense. There is a 
lot of overlap of students. Stu­
dents who live far from down­
town would have access. It 
would make the routes more 
general.”
Lenore M. Waldron
Freshman
Civil Engineering
“I think it would be great. 
That way parties between 
schools could happen and people 
would have a way to get home 
late at night, on the weekend, or 
in the winter. Also, students 
could take classes at other 
schools.”
Sam Greenfield/Tartan Photographer
Mike Gelman 
Senior

“Actually, it sounds like a;: 
good idea. The only problem:.: 
is that it may be hard to keep.., 
maintaining the shuttles.”.
Adam Farmerie
Sophomore
Architecture
“We don’t go down to Pitt 
enough for shuttle service to be 
extended. Too many Pitt stu­
dents would take up all the 
available spaces on the shuttle. 
No one goes down to Duquesne 
anyway.”

PRESS PASS

Super Bowl 
becomes 
Super Bore
The Super Bowl was played 
Jesterday, and I didn’t care in 
¡¡he-'slightest. Even though the 
|aitfe was between two of my 
favorite non-Steeler teams, I 
couldn’t even tell you who 
won.
I have several ideas where 
¿his apathy came from, but the 
jjet result is that for the last 
geveral years, pro football has 
fecome increasingly boring. 
TfieTdea of sitting through the 
Super Bowl has, for me, 
degenerated from a event of 
epic proportions to a tiresome 
chore.
Certainly, the end of the 
Steeler dynasty has something 
to do with it. Being a local (you 
say “yinzer,” and I kill) I was 
here for the Steeler salad days. 
Remember the slogan, “One 
for the thumb in ’81?” I cer­
tainly do. Unfortunately, those 
¡Steeler teams are gone, and 
);he experts aren’t predicting 
the adornment of that mythi­
cal thumb until the next 
century.
Time is another big con­
straint. Between classes, The 
Tartan, drinking, and other 
assorted college activities, who 
has time to vegetate in front of 
the television watching a good 
football game, much less a 
mediocre one? The last time I 
spent a Sunday at home, doing 
nothing (semester breaks 
excluded) would have been two 
years ago.
; Even within sports, there 
are other distractions. I never 
tiked hockey back in the olden 
(Jays, and basketball games 
were only interesting in the 
final two minutes. Soccer? You 
must be kidding! For ari 
American child growing up in 
the seventies, especially in my 
neighborhood, liking soccer 
would have been like admit­
ting you were a Communist.
The big difference, as cliché 
as it sounds, is my loss of 
innocence about athletics in 
general. Back when I was a 
kid, I never knew about 
contract holdouts, agents, 
steroids, Proposition 48, or any 
<¡>1 the other buzzwords you see 
flying across the sports page 
illese days. The game was all 
that was there, and it was a 
lot more fun.
This is, coincidentally, a lot 
the appeal of Division III 
sports — you don’t see Rich 
tackner or Tony Wingen 
havering back and forth 
tyetween the jobs of TV analyst 
and'coach. Derek Dragisich 
isn’t going to have to sit for a 
semester because he can’t 
read. Gerri Seidl hasn’t been 
busted for giving cars to 
Players as recruiting gifts. I 
could go on, but you get the 
idea.
I’m sure that news of the 
Super Bowl will eventually 
filter down to me. As pervasive 
the media is in our society, 
s almost certain that I’ll get 
to see every important play 
a,nd hear the experts analyze
everything down to the 
coaches’ choices of sock color. 
ut there’s no rush on it; it’s 
JUst not that important any 
more.

Men fall 
short at NYU
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Contributing Editor
For the first 38 minutes of 
yesterday’s University Ath­
letic Association men’s bas­
ketball showdown between. 
New York University and 
Carnegie Mellon, it looked 
like the Tartans were on their 
wa3r to an upset victory. Un­
fortunately for CMU, the Vio­
lets regrouped in the final 
minutes and handed the Tar­
tans a 89-83 loss, dropping 
them back to the .500 mark 
on the season.
“It’s tough,” said head coach 
Tony Wingen. “I felt that we 
had a good game plan and we 
executed it just the way we 
wanted to. It’s obviously frus­
trating that we weren’t able 
to pull out the win.”
Hot shooting from the field 
was the Tartans’ best ally 
early on in the game. The 
Tartans shot .586 in the first 
half, including five for seven 
from three-point range. By 
the middle of the period, the 
Tartans had opened up a 
game-high 11-point lead.
Tartan fouls and hot shoot­
ing by NYU guard Chris 
Pursoo, who led all scorers 
with 25 points, cut the lead 
down to four, but the Tartans 
went on a late run to take a
40-30 lead with two minutes 
left. The Tartans then suf­
fered a breakdown as NYU 
scored six points in the final 
minute .of the period. At the 
half, CMU held a slim 40-36 
lead.
“NYU is a very athletic 
pressure team,” said Wingen. 
“One definite key to success 
was to take care of the ball 
against their press. We had a 
couple breakdowns near the 
half, and at the end of the 
game, but I was generally 
pleased.”
NYU’s momentum carried 
over into the second half, and 
the Violets tied the game at
49 with 13:53 left to play. 
However, fouls, which had 
hurt the Tartans early , came 
to the Tartans’ aid. CMU 
scored 13 straight points from 
the free-throw line to gain a 
73-63 advantage with seven 
minutes to play. Carnegie 
Mellon had an impressive day 
at the line, hitting 17 of 19 
shots.
Unfortunately, the tide of 
the fouls shifted down the 
stretch. Sophomore forward 
Charlie Connors fouled out 
with 4:30 on the clock; twenty 
seconds later, the Violets 
were within one point, 77- 
76. The two teams traded 
three-pointers, but another 
three from Pursoo (who had 
six on the day) tied the game 
at 82 with less than two min­
utes to play.
The door opened for the 
NYU victory with 1:24 left as 
the Tartans were whistled 
for a three-second violation. 
On the ensuing possession, 
NYU forward Thomas Brown 
hit the go-ahead basket with 
48 seconds on the clock. The

NEW YORK, NY—The CMU women’s basket­
ball team suffered its first loss since the opening 
weekend of the season yesterday, dropping a 64- 
46 decision to New York University. The loss gave 
the Tartans a 7-1 mark in the University Athletic

Association, as well as a 15-2 overall record.
“We just didn’t play well,” said head coach 
Gerri Seidl. “We. played sluggish and we weren’t 
aggressive enough on defense.” The Tartans came
into the game injured; senior guard Heather 
O’Donnell was out of action with a left ankle 
injury suffered during Friday night’s game against 
the University of Chicago, and freshman forward 
Meredith McKnight saw limited action due to 
illness.
However, the bigger problem was the insidè 
game — CMU was out-rebounded 27-17 in the 
first half, and allowed 11 turnovers before the 
break. After the first eight minutes, the game was 
deadlocked at 13, but the Violets began to pull 
away. A 10-1 run over the next six minutes 
ensued, led by guard Beth Shapiro, who scored 20 
on the day, including four three pointers.
The Tartan bench got even thinner when sopho­
more forward Mary Moore had to leave the game 
with 2:25 left in the first half. Moore suffered a cut 
over her right eye when battling NYU’s Donna 
Layne for a rebound. The injury was yet another 
example of the lax standards the referees were 
using for most of the game, as no foul was called.' 
Seidl downplays the role of the officiating in the 
loss, but the referees’ hands-off approach cer­
tainly made for a tougher inside game.
“[Depth] certainly played some role,” said Seidl. 
“We’re used to playing nine or 10 people, and not 
having Heather [O’Donnelll and Mary [Moore] 
forced us to make an adjustment. However, I 
think we would have been OK within that limita^ 
tion if we had executed better.” By this point, the 
Tartans were down by nine points, and things got 
worse as the end of the half approached. Three 
consecutive NYU baskets pushed the lead to 15 
before junior guard Kelly Sterling hit a basket in 
the final seconds, making the halftime score 33- 
20.
At the start of the second half, it looked as if the 
Tartans were on the verge of yet another come­
back. The Tartans chopped seven points off the 
Violet lead in the first four minutes, but three 
quick Tartan fouls allowed the lead to return to 13, 
by the 13:30 mark. The see-saw battle continued; 
but the Tartans were able to climb back to within! 
single digits with less that eight minutes to play.!
Unfortunately for the Tartans, they weren’t! 
able to close the gap any further than eight points.

Tartan Staffwriter 
The CMU swimmers dominated their meet Saturday against 
Bethany College. The men’s team won by the commanding score of 
93-66. The women’s team had an equally decisive victory, as they 
downed Bethany 78-55. CMU’s women’s team took the first place 
ribbon in every event swam, and the men’s team failed to capture 
first place in only two events.
Coach Jim Cutrone said, “They swam very well for being as tired 
as they are from the training.” The training, which included a week 
in Ft. Lauderdale during Christmas break, is beginning to show its 
effectiveness as several team members achieved personal records 
while swimming to victory over Bethany.
For the women, senior Glynis Frost won the 400-yard individual 
medley with her best unshaved time of 5:00:35. Senior Debbie 
Madsen’s time of 5:47:64 was her best time of the year in the 500- 
yard freestyle. Junior Heather Wasilowski had her best time ever 
in the 200-yard backstroke, as she won that event in 2:39:74.
On the men’s team, three swimmers achieved best ever times 
during this meet. Junior Ted Beatty swam the 200-yard individual

The CMU men’s basketball 
team defeated the University of 
Chicago Maroons Friday night 
at Skibo Gym, 75-49. The 26- 
point margin of victory yvas the 
largest for the Tartans this sea­
son, boosting their record to 7-6 
overall, 2-4 in the UAA stand­
ings. The Maroons fell to 4—11, 
0-5 in UAA play.
The first fifteen minutes of 
the game were evenly played 
with Carnegie Mellon down 21- 
20 despite shooting under 40 
percent from the field and com­
mitting 12 turnovers.
“I was not pleased with our 
first-half performance. We didn’t 
take care of the ball, and made 
some silly mistakes,” said head 
coach Tony Wingen, “but we 
were able to gain our composure
at the end of the first half.”
The Tartans did just that, scor­
ing the iast nine points of the 
half to take a 29-21 lead. Their 
momentum rolled on into the 
second half as the Tartans shot 
a blistering 80 percent from the 
field, and outscored the Maroons 
46-28.
Despite a height advantage, 
the Maroons’ inside game was 
nonexistent. “We surprised them 
by mixing our defenses and play­
ing a lot more zone than usual. 
We fronted their big men and 
took away their passing lanes“, 
Wingen said. “The second half 
was a total team effort, espe­
cially our defense and rebound­
ing. ” The Tartans outrebounded 
the Maroons 13-4, converting 
transition baskets on quick out­
let passes.
A run of 11 straight points, 
capped of by a three-pointer by
Mike Hosni and a Charlie 
Connors dunk with 6:32 left in 
the second session, built the lead ; 
to 24 points. The two teams con- . 
tinued to trade baskets for the 
rest of the period until sopho- < 
more forward Steve Rennekamp 
netted a basket with nine sec- ; 
onds left to ensure the 26-point ¡; 
edge.
The balanced scoring attack < 
was led by sophomores Mike ; 
Hosni with 15 points and five 
assists, and Derek Dragisich ‘ 
with 12 points and 11 rebounds. ! 
Also contributing to the victory !' 
were junior Chris Benec with 
nine points, sophomores Charlie ; 
Connors and Rony Johns with ¡1 
eight and 11 points respectively, ¡1 
and freshman point guard 
Dwayne Coleman with four ; 
points. Forward Ali Lejlic led 
the Chicago attack with 12 
points.

Golden State becomes 
one of NBA’s elite teams
By CHRIS CENKNER
' ¦Tartan Sports Editor
Golden State. GOLDEN STATE!?! 
It’s hard to swallow, but the Golden 
State Warriors are in first place in the 
pacific Division, tied with the Portland 
Trailblazers. This is the spot that was 
consistently occupied by the Los Ange­
les Lakers, but Coach Don Nelson and 
his boys have marched into territory 
that the Warriors haven’t seen since 
the days of Rick Barry and his under­
handed style of free-throw shooting.
Things looked to be on the rise a few 
years ago when the Warriors drafted 
Chris Mullin out of
him the first player from the now-ex- 
tinct Soviet Union. Along with the ad­
dition of Tim Hardaway, the Warriors 
were poised to make a statement in the 
NBA.
At the beginning of this season, the 
Warriors were all over the sports pages. 
Coach Nelson had traded his beloved 
Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for 
rookie phenomenon Billy Owens of 
Syracuse. This move had the fans reel­
ing, but Nelson and the Warriors’ front 
office saw huge potential for the kid 
who could light up the scoreboard with 
his smooth shooting touch and crash 
the boards as fiercely as his old Syra-
bling and soft shooting touch has made 
him the prime candidate for this year’s 
sixth man award.
So here they sit, poised in first place 
with the Portland Trailblazers for the 
first time in a while. They are not out 
of reach, however. Breathing heavily 
down their necks are the Phoenix Suns, 
and even the Los Angeles Lakers are 
not out of the picture (three games back 
as of yesterday) in fourth place. With 
the All-Star game coming up on Febru­
ary 9 in Orlando, the Warriors will 
have some time to catch their breath 
and continue their campaign to win the 
division title.
•St. John’s, but his 
¦-¿out with alcohol­
ism saw him spend­
ing more time in 
rehab than in 
warmups. Also, the 
center position 
seemed to be locked 
up with the mmmmmmmmmm 
Sudanese shadow,
•Manute Bol, guarding the skies. But 
This was not the case, as Bol was sent to 
the Sixers two seasons ago. So the anx­
ious Warrior fans would have to wait 
for the catalyst to wake this sleeping 
giant of a team.
This catalyst came in the form of 
point guard Mitch Richmond, who, 
helped to push Nelson’s up-tempo style 
of play and made the Warriors respect­
able again. Richmond won Rookie-of- 
the-Year honors and was a crowd favor­
ite in the Bay Area. Chris Mullin re­
turned to the court after overcoming 
-his addiction and achieved all-star sta-
¦ tus. The Warriors also reached across 
Atlantic to snare Sharaunus

days of Rick Barry and his underhanded style of free- 
throw shooting.
cuse cohort, last season’s Rookie-of-the- 
Year, Derrick Coleman.
Although the tandem of RUN-TMC 
(Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and 
Chris Mullin) was disbanded, the War­
riors didn’t miss a beat as Owens 
stepped in and brought his animated 
style of play into San Fransisco. One of 
the biggest worries surrounding Owens 
was if he would be able to keep up his 
end of the scoring, as the TMC trio 
combined to be the top-scoring 1-2-3 
punch in the NBA last season. The 
Warriors still have the top scoring 
combo this season, but the third high 
scorer is Marshalonis, not Owens. 
Marshalonis has raised his game to 
another level this year. His slick drib­
If they are able to do that, which is 
going to be very difficult with the cali­
ber of teams in the Pacific, they will 
have to face some of the strong teams in 
the Midwest Division like Utah and 
San Antonio. And if they are fortunate 
enough to win the Western Conference 
crown, they will have to lock horns with 
the defending champion Chicago Bulls, 
who should waltz easily into the finals 
this year. It’s a lot of speculation, I 
know, but coach Nelson has the kind of 
team that could pull it off. Can the 
Warriors beat the Bulls? Tune in next 
time.

MEN-NYU, from page 13
additional padding to the NYU lead 
came about down the stretch as CMU 
had to foul to regain possession of 
the ball.
“Their game plan is just to put the 
ball up and rebound,” said Wingen. 
“I didn’t think we were going to be 
able to outrebound them, but I felt if 
we could limit their second chances, 
we’d be right in it.
“On one hand, I’m disappointed, 
but I think, and I hope the players 
realize, that it was a real accom­
plishment to go to NYU and show 
that we could stay with the number
14 team in Division III, and the 
leader in our league.”
Sophomore forward Michael 
Hosni’s 21 points led five Tartans 
who scored in double figures, and 
sophomore guard Rony Johns added 
15. Sophomore guard Matt Reiprish, 
junior guard Todd Jenkins, and 
sophomore center Derek Dragisich 
chipped in 13, 11, and 10 points 
respectively. Top players for the Vio­
lets were Pursoo, forward Rob Ca­
pers (18 points, 17 rebounds), and 
guard Thomas Bowman, who scored
15 points before fouling out in the 
final minute.
The Tartans, now 7-7 overall (2-5 in 
the UAA), will have a few days off lead­
ing up to this Sunday’s 3 pm matchup 
against Brandéis University.

WOMEN’S BB, from page 13
The closing minutes belonged to the 
Violets (the Tartans went scoreless for 
the final 2:19), and NYU widened the 
lead to its final 18-point margin.
“I think the injuries became a prob­
lem in the second half,” said senior 
'center Amy Buxbaum. “Without all our 
players, we couldn’t run against them 
as much as we would have liked.”
“In the first meeting [a 60-42 Tartan 
win on December 6], we shut down 
their inside game, and we weren’t able 
to do that today. In particular, I thought 
Donna Layne [NYU’s second-leading 
scorer] had a really strong game,” said 
Seidl.
Layne led all scorers with 22 points 
and contributed 15 rebounds as well. 
Buxbaum led the Tartan attack with
10 points and 14 rebounds; sophomore 
forward Jeanine Megahan added nine 
more points, and senior guard Bridget 
Eperthener added eight points and
mark.
“I thought that was our best overall 
game, from a team standpoint,” said 
Seidl. “We played great team defense.”
“I thought that [the Chicago game] was our 
best overall game, from a team standpoint. ”

seven rebounds.
On Friday, the Tartans extended 
their winning streak to 14 in a row, 
defeating the University of Chicago, 
54-39. The win wasn’t pretty—the two 
teams combined for 51 turnovers, and 
the Tartans lost O’Donnell — but it 
gave the Tartans a perfect 7-0' UAA
Between the turnovers and solid de­
fense, the game got off to a very slug­
gish start. The Maroons shot a paltry 
.261 in the first half, but were still in 
the game, trailing 15-14 with seven 
minutes left in the first half. The Tar­
tans were able to pick up the offensive 
pace and extended their lead to 26-16
by the half.
The second half of the game was 
offensively cleaner, but the results 
were the same. The Maroons couldn’t 
get any closer than seven points as 
the cold shooting and tough defense 
continued. A 7-2 Chicago run made 
the score 46-39 with 4:38 left, but 
forward Tina Klawinski’s foul shots 
would be the last Chicago points of 
the game. Eperthener threw in the 
last eight Tartan points, including a 
three-pointer atthe buzzer, to polish 
off the 15-point victory margin.
Megahan led the Tartan scorers 
with 12 points (ten of which came 
after the half), and Moore added 10 
points. Buxbaum’s 12rebounds were 
once again the team-best total. The 
Maroons were led by guards Claire
Brouder and Kim Burke, who scored 
nine and eight points, respectively. 
The Tartans held Catherine 
Fitzgerald, the Maroons’ leading 
scorer, to six points, all of which 
came from the free-throw stripe.
In the week’s only other action, 
CMU picked up a 64-60 overtime 
victory at Allegheny College. 
Megahan led the Tartans with 18 
points, and Moore added 15 more. In 
addition, Buxbaum pulled down a 
career-high 19 rebounds.
The Tartans return to action this 
Sunday with a 1 pm game agr.inst 
the Brandeis Judges. The Tartans 
swept the season series last year 
(56-54 in Skibo, 57-54 on the road), 
and both Moore and O’Donnell are 
likely to be back in acti- >n.

Burkey swam the 100-yard back­
stroke in 55:85.
Freshman Don Nelson swam 
a time of1:57:23 in the 200-yard 
freestyle to finish in his best 
time of the year. Sophomore 
Anupam Narula swam the 200- 
yard fly in 2:06:61 to achieve his 
best unshaved time.
The team will now begin to
taper off of the intensive prac­
tice schedule that they have been 
following to allow for rest. 
Cutrone feels that their last meet 
of the season before going to the 
University Athletic Association 
championships, against Slippery 
Rock University will be a chal­
lenge. “I expect it to be a tough 
meet, and it should be a good one 
for us,” he said. The Tartan 
swimmers travel to Slippery 
Rock on Saturday, and the UAA
champioships will be held Feb­
ruary 12—15 at Emory Univer­
sity in Atlanta.
Since this was the last home 
meet of the season, the team 
made a special presentation to 
their senior members. Glynis 
Frost, Anna Lesko, Debbie 
Madsen, and Brian Zimmerman 
were each presented with a gift 
and received a special round of 
applause from their teammates 
and the spectators.

Self Awareness
The office of Student Affairs is hold­
ing a Skills for Leadership Seminar 
this Saturday, which will feature a va­
riety of workshops led by a number of 
campus and community leaders, and 
will feature keynote speaker Dr. Erwin 
Steinberg, vice provost for education at 
Carnegie Mellon.
The workshops are designed to allow 
interaction between the students and 
the speakers and are scheduled 
throughout the day; several are offered 
more than once. The workshops are 
geared towardleaders of organizations, 
but are open to any student on campus, 
including resident assistants and ori-
entation counselors, or students who 
simply want to get involved in extra­
curricular activities.
Anne Witchner, director of Student 
Activities and assistant dean of Stu­
dent Affairs, says, “It is a good way to 
bring the students together and help 
familiarize them with the facilities.” 
The seminar will allow the students to 
get into contact with the people they 
may want to know. Witchner will also

Community Service
Partners in Service, a new commu­
nity service program for members of 
the CMU campus community, is well 
underway. Masterminded by Dave Pot­
ter, area coordinator of the Housing
I Office, and Harriet Schwartz, assis­
tant to the dean of Student Affairs, the 
v. program’s object is to provide pre-ar- 
’ ranged volunteer service opportunities 
to all members of the campus commu­
nity.
The premise of the program is to 
encourage interaction between stu­
dents, faculty, staff, and administra­
tion while serving neighboring Pitts­
burgh communities. A student organi­
With 1992 getting underway, a frenzy

Resolution many of us make to get into

£help meet this end, here is a look at

¡-students wb" "el angry and who want

The Highlander Café 
The Highlander is known for its un­
necessary overuse of fat. Although the 
e*tra pound of butter on the French 
toast or the extra coat of fat on the 
grilled cheese sandwiches tastes 
pummy, the long term effects of such 
^buse to our digestive systems can be 
dangerous. One grilled cheese sand­

zation can pick a service project from a 
list of volunteer opportunities, and 
members are encouraged to invite fac­
ulty members to join them in their 
endeavors. Most events take less than 
half a day, and an organization can 
even submit its own ideas for commu­
nity service. “The strategy here is to 
make community service as easy as 
possible,” explains Potter. “The organi­
zation doesn’t have to -worry about it.” 
Many programs are available to 
choose from, too. The programs can 
accommodate from four to 100 volun­
teers, probing almost any interest. 
Services, vary from helping with chil­
dren and the elderly, to the homeless 
and the environment.
The largest of the projects is with the 
Greater Pittsburgh Community Food 
Bank. Up to 100 volunteers can work 
on weeknights or Saturday mornings 
to help repackage bulk food to be dis­
tributed to over 80 soup kitchens

than a whole day’s daily recommended 
allowance of fat.
Since fat is not what New Year’s 
resolutionaries are craving, the lard- 
enriched food that CMDS prepares can 
be avoided with a bee-line to the salad 
bar. Offering a variety of fresh veg­
etables and pasta, the salad bar is the 
nutritional alternative to the typically 
fat-fortified entrée.
For dessert, eat up the lime, rasp­
berry, or strawberry Jello. Jello is the 
most common source of a non-fat food 
product at the Highlander.
The most charitable characteristics 
of the Highlander Café is its all-you- 
can-eat policy. If you find something 
that you like, you can go back for sec­
onds. Or, more, if you find nothing 
tempting or satisfying, the cereal selec­
tion is the best safety net around for 
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Dietary Needs
The Tartan Grill
The Tartan Grill, famous for its fast 
food selection of individually-wrapped 
hamburgers, pre-packaged salads, and 
help-yourself hotdogs, is not the rec­
ommended place to find a wholesome 
meal. The vast majority of comestibles 
in the joint are relatively high in fat 
and calories.
It does redeem itself somewhat in its 
limited assortment of yogurt, salad, 
and cereal, and in the fact that its hash 
browns are better for you than the hash 
browns at the Highlander. Because the 
Tartan toasts its hash browns, the hash 
browns contain one-sixth less fat and 
one-half fewer calories than those at 
the Highlander, where slabs of pota­
toes are fried.

If there are gods at CMU, they are 
probably those two-dollar, red and gold, 
academic planners that the bookstore 
sells by the truck load at the beginning 
of every semester. Unfortunately in 
some cases, even the really good gods 
last for only a few weeks.
Time management — do you remem­
ber what that is? Remember that ideal­
istic moment on New Year’s Day right 
after you recovered from your hang­
over and vowed never to drink again? 
This was probably the first of those 
New Year’s resolutions you broke, fore­
going the opportunity to spend a quiet 
night at home working on your resumé 
to go out drinking with those friends 
from home that you haven’t seen for 
months. Or was it that appointment 
you promised yourself that you would 
make with the Counseling Center to 
have them teach you how to manage 
your time without going completely and 
unquestionably insane? So, in place of 
time management skills, how do stu­
dents at Carnegie Mellon manage to 
get things done on time? Caffeine. How 
much you get done depends on how 
much you take in.
SODA, POP, CARBONATED BEV­
ERAGE, CAFFEINE IN A CAN
This seems common for some of those 
more minor assignments, maybe a 
unresearched six page paper or a prob­

lem set. Soda pop is one of the most 
accessible means of caffeine-induced 
time management around on campus 
and if this is all you do in the way of 
taking stimulants, you probably don’t 
do a terrible job of time management. 
You probably keep an assignment cal­
endar or a notebook with upcoming due 
dates. Planning is never perfect, but if 
it's just a can or two of Coke or Moun­
tain Dew that you’re consuming, you’re 
probably not in bad shape. Your resolu­
tion is reasonably intact. Congratula­
tions on being unique in the world of 
resolution makers.
COFFEE, TEA, SCALDING LIQUID 
CAFFEINE
These come into play for those larger 
jobs — papers above six but below ten 
pages, two problem sets, and big pieces 
of artwork. Here the trouble starts. 
Coffee and tea, too, now that everyone 
has discovered that it has more caf­
feine, are the classic bum-the-midnight-
oil drinks. Some planning has probably 
gone into getting work done and as­
signments in, but it falls apart in places. 
You probably have an assignment book 
but don’t look at it every day. You’re 
probably not far from the soda pop 
level; you just need to get your act

Arctic temperatures cause brains to freeze
Sleigh bells ring, are you lis­
tening? In the lane, snow is glis­
tening. A beautiful sight, we’re 
happy tonight, walking in a Win­
ter Wonderland.
What a load of crap.
During these past two weeks 
I’ve experienced nothing but icy 
roads, arctic temperatures, 
freezing winds, tons of snow, and 
numb feet. Who on earth de­
cided that these trials warrant 
the title “Winter Wonderland”? 
If I had it my way, this silly song 
(written by my good friend Mike) 
.would go something like this....
On your car, snow is heaping. 
Highway’s packed, traffic’s creep­
ing. There’s nothing in sight, the 
windshield is white, driving in a 
Winter No-man’s-land.
Okay, it might not be Bach, 
but it conveys the true spirit of 
winter, unlike that other fairy 
tale.
I don’t know what it is about 
winter this year. Usually I like 
snow and bone-numbing tem­
peratures, but for some reason 
I’m not enjoying winter at all 
this year.
When I was a kid, and totally 
crazy, snow and cold weather 
didn’t affect me. I used to ride 
my bike to school every single 
day, no matter what the weather.
“What Mom? You say it’s fifty 
below, with freezing rain and 
hail the size of compact cars? 
Maybe you’re right, maybe I 
should wear a jacket....”
I never felt the cold when I 
was a kid, my brain just wouldn’t 
let my body accept the fact that 
it was freezing outside and that 
I actually needed to wear more 
than one layer of clothing. The 
only way my mother could make 
me wear a sweater was by sew­
ing them to the inside of my T- 
shirts.
As I got older and a little more 
aware of the weather conditions 
around me (“Wow, snow and 
freezing rain are actually cold/”), 
I began to drive to school, which 
was pretty much the same as
LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, 
AND STEVE
by Stephen Glicker
living inside a small mobile 
heated house.
During the winter, I would go 
outside, start the car, go back 
into the house, have breakfast, 
get into my warm car, drive to 
school, park in the sun, run the 
very cold hundred yards from 
the parking lot to the school, 
defrost, daydream and goof-off 
until school ended, run back to 
my car (which was warm after 
being in the sun all day), drive 
home, and stay there until 
spring.
As you can see, during my high 
school years my version of win­
ter was very heat orientated. 
More importantly, I managed to 
go through my entire high school 
career without once wearing 
more than one layer of clothing. 
A major accomplishment in my 
book; I believe I even put it on a 
college application.
However, once I got to CMU, 
everything drastically changed. 
My days of endless heat were 
about to end.
My first indication of what cold 
winter weather was really like 
was during my freshman year. 
It was during a history class 
when the professor called on me 
to answer a question when I 
discovered that I couldn’t re­
spond because my lips were fro­
zen shut. After that fun experi­
ence, I went out and bought my 
first sweatshirt.
Since then I’ve slowly learned 
to live with the fact that man 
was not meant to coexist with 
the snowman. Over the years
I’ve bought sweaters, a thick 
winter coat, long sleeved shirts, 
even a hat. All I have to do now 
is to start wearing them and I’ll 
be set (I’ll never give in to cold 
weather, never!).
As for the reason why I’m hav­
ing so much trouble this winter, 
it primarily has to do with my 
car. You see, I believe that my 
car wants to kill me. Either that 
or some people at the Honda 
factory are having a really big 
laugh right now, because for the 
past two weeks my car has been 
behaving weirdly.
For some odd reason, ice 
doesn’t form on the outside of 
my car, only on the inside. And 
the ice that forms is so thin, that 
my ice scraper doesn’t even know 
that it’s there.
As a result, I feel like I’m driv­
ing a tent down the road. All I 
can usually see are lights and 
faint images which look like cars 
wearing winter camouflage. My 
only consolation is knowing that 
I must be a constant source of 
amusement for other drivers.
“Honey, did you just see that 
funny man in the white Honda? 
He was driving while using an 
ice scraper inside his car!”
Believe me, I’ll be laughing all 
the way to the hospital.
Another reason I’m having so 
much trouble this winter is the 
fact that people are starting to 
act even more stupid than nor­
mal. I think the cold weather’s 
to blame — it freezes people’s 
brains causing them to stop 
thinking.
For instance, a couple of days 
ago while I was driving down 
Forbes, and in the process of 
scraping ice off my windshield, I 
noticed a man walking down the 
middle of the street, carrying 
groceries. Now, I’m no rocket 
scientist, but doesn’t walking 
down the middle of a busy, icy 
street seem just a bit unsafe? 
What on earth could this guy 
have been thinking?
“Wow, look at all these people
on the sidewalk. I don’t know if 
I can take the pressure. Maybe 
I’ll just walk in the middle of the 
street. There doesn’t seem to be 
many people walking there.”
Finally come the jaywalkers. 
Jaywalkers are always annoy­
ing, but during the winter, they 
pass the stage of annoyance and 
go right to the category of brain­
less, one-celled creatures.
And for some unknown reason
the number of jaywalkers has 
steadily increased over the last 
couple of weeks. What on earth 
could these people be thinking 
to compel them to jaywalk dur­
ing the winter?
“Let’s see, there’s a foot of snow 
on the road, random patches of 
ice, I’m on a steep hill, the road 
is filled with trucks and buses, 
there’s a guy walking down the 
middle of the street, and some
Aj/tr£L-
Jeff Dorsey/Tartan Art Staff 
idiot is driving a tent down the 
road — perfect jaywalking con­
ditions! What could possibly go 
wrong?”
Believe me, I’ll be laughing all 
the way while he’s going to the 
hospital.

INTERNATIONAL
EXCHANGES
by Oliver Williams
At the outset I must confess 
my preconceptions about typi­
cal American university life 
which, for the uninformed, in­
clude the belief that the average 
American student is rather laid 
back in his or her academic stud­
ies and does not value his or her 
education as strongly as stu­
dents in British universities do. 
I also had images of the stu­
dents in this country placing 
socializing high on their list of 
priorities and this conclusion 
was heavily influenced by the 
mass media, both in the U.S. 
and abroad.
Having now arrived at Carn­
egie Mellon and experienced two 
weeks of American university 
life, I have discovered that my 
preconceptions were miscon­
strued, particularly concerning 
the American student ethos at 
this institution.
The heterogeneity between 
this university and my current 
university in England (which in 
my opinion, is a quintessential 
English university — academi­
cally and socially) is very promi­
nent. I must emphasize at this 
point that, in comparing CMU 
with my home university, I am
in no way trying to generalize 
about American universities as 
a whole. I am simply relating 
my own personal insights of 
CMU.
Let me state that there is a 
marked difference between the 
teaching methods in England as 
compared to those in the USA, 
which I believe is a significant 
factor affecting the remainder 
of what I am about to discuss.
At CMU, course grading is di­
vided between class participa­
tion, homework, mid-term and 
final exams. This decreases the 
importance of any one activity. 
This is definitely not the case in 
the UK. In the UK, we do have
tional system. Although the 
American way of teaching has 
the effect of keeping a constant 
check on a student’s work and 
lessening the final burden on 
him, I believe (from an objective 
perspective) that the British way 
of teaching is more effective in 
the long-run. My reasons for such 
a statement lie in my belief that 
the student under pressure to 
review for exam finals (which 
are nearly 100 percent of the 
final grade) is receiving signifi­
cant practice in a high state of 
emotion, which will be most rel­
evant for him in times of stress 
later in life.
In particular, the type of occu-
weight on homework, et. al., it 
severely restricts the student’s 
social life. In the UK, however, 
our method of teaching allows 
students to socialize to a much 
greater extent than their Ameri­
can counterparts and still main­
tain their sound academic 
record.
Furthermore, the American 
drinking age of 21 distinguishes 
the students’ social life here from 
the British student’s way of life. 
In my home country the legal 
drinking age is 16 (most stu­
dents have started younger). 
Thus, when they arrive at the 
university, they are extremely 
well experienced in drinking. In 
particular, British students 
know how to get drunk.
At universities similar to mine 
in England, approximately 90 
percent of a student’s social life 
is centered around beer drink­
ing. At my university, the in­
ducement to drink beer is strong, 
with three sizable bars on cam­
pus as well as approximately 
seven or eight pubs within close
proximity.
Thus, from my limited experi­
ence so far within an American1 
educational environment, my 
eyes have been opened to many1 
interesting discoveries. Due to 
their educational and legal sys­
tems, Americans do not enjoy 
the apparent luxury of the Brit­
ish pub.

student originally from Switzer-' 
land. He attended his first fra­
ternity party last weekend.
some course work/projects that 
are part of the final grade, but if 
they are included, they account 
for a relatively small proportion 
of the student’s final grade — 
the vast weight of the percent­
age being obtained in the 
student’s final examination. 
Essentially, what I am saying is 
that British grading at the uni­
versity is 100 percent final exam.
I am slowly adjusting to the

university like mine apply for

tive and demanding ones, of 
which stress is to be anticipated, 
if not expected.
In reference to the previous 
discussion, I believe that the 
British and American systems 
of teaching have different im­
pacts on a student’s social life.

teaching and its significant

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 27 January 1992
Winter comes, noses run
It's been snowing lately — a 
lot. I can tell from the chill in the 
air, the white stuff on the ground, 
and the way old guys have been 
blowing their noses. Whenever 
¡t’s snowing a lot, you can bet 
¡bat somewhere an old guy is 
about to step outside, look 
around, and attack his nostrils 
with a wrinkled handkerchief. I 
y“attack” because at a certain 
¡e, blowing the nose becomes 
exactly that. As snot matures it 
becomes sneaky and much less 
willing to give itself up. If it’s 
going to be caught, it’s got to be 
by surprise attack.
You’ve seen it happen. You’re 
standing there talking with an 
old guy about cigars or some­
thing, and out of nowhere he 
grabs for his hanky and brings it 
to his nose in a crazed fit, as if a 
p has entered his nasal cav­
ity. Using his pointer fingers as 
s probes, he drives the hand­
kerchief up his nostrils, burrow­
ing in hot pursuit of the retreat­
ing,wily snot, and rubbing away 
at that divider of flesh that 
makes it so easy for them to 
hide. Then, after examining the 
hanky for trophies, he folds his 
weapon carefully, like a soldier 
folding Old Glory, and stuffs it 
into his back pocket with the tip 
sticking out, ready for the next 
quick draw. War is hell.
But men are not the only ones. 
With age, women also develop 
curious nose-blowing habits. At 
times, they too attack violently, 
but unlike older men, older
WHATEVER HAPPENED 
TO PLATINUM BLONDES?
by Andrew Cosentino
women feel the need to hoard 
used tissues much like a squir­
rel hoards nuts. “Gather used 
tissues, while ye may” I began 
noticing the mature female’s tis- 
sue-hoarding instincts as early 
as kindergarten. What is it with 
kindergarten teachers, anyway? 
Is it a requirement that they 
reek of mentholyptus vapors and 
that their noses run like open 
fire hydrants? During story time 
we’d all watch my teacher, old 
Mrs. Engleman, tuck away 
bunches of used tissues under 
her sleeve, where no one could 
snatch them from her. She was 
in constant fear that the Kleenex 
company would be firebombed 
by those radicals from the Mu­
cous Rescue League, and didn’t 
want to take any chances. So 
there I sat, listening to Green 
Eggs and Ham, but much more 
interested in why the hell my 
elementary school teacher was 
filling her sleeve with used tis­
sues. At the time, I felt that 
socks were a far more absorbant 
compartment.
Now I don’t know about you, 
but when I was in kindergarten, 
some genius in the administra­
tion decided that it would be a 
good idea for hyperactive 
kindergarteners to have “nap 
time” as a part of their school 
day. The idea behind “nap time” 
was to give kindergarteners a 
chance to catch up on some of 
that sleep they lost while shoot­
ing craps till all hours of the 
night. “Nap time” also gave old 
Mrs. Engleman a chance to 
sneak over to her desk and empty 
the used tissues from her sleeve 
into her briefcase so she could 
take them home and show her 
husband.
“John, will you look at all these 
things?”
“Gee, dear, you made quite a 
killing today. Now put them in 
the attic with the rest, next to 
the silver quarters. No one will 
find them there.”
You can imagine how well “nap 
time” worked. We lied there on

children to be lazy enough to

spect, kindergarten was the most 
crucial of years spent in prepa­

Community Service
COMMUNITY, from LI
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
There are also service oppor­
tunities to help those of all ages. 
The Living at Home Program 
provides support to elderly 
people who five at home but need 
help with some everyday neces­
sities. Volunteers will help older 
people with grocery shopping 
andyardwork, as well as accom­
panying them on movie and 
bowling excursions.
Whale’s Tale, another organi­
zation that helps the impover­
ished and homeless, has two dif­
ferent types of service opportu­
nities. One is an opportunity for 
volunteers who will spend an 
afternoon working with run­
away or orphaned children. 
“We’d like the [Whale’s Tale] 
volunteers to try a specific 
Project, like art or games or 
music,” says Schwartz. Another
has volunteers doing general 
work at a clothing distribution 
center.
Two environmental opportu­
nities are also offered in the 
Partners in Service program. 
The Squirrel Hill Urban Coali­
tion sponsors a program to do 
area clean up in Squirrel Hill. 
Volunteers pick up parks and 
streets on Saturday and Sunday 
mornings as per the recommen­
dation of the Coalition.
Pittsburgh Parks, Recreation 
and Conservation offers two pro­
grams to help the environment, 
both of which can accommodate 
volunteers on Saturdays. Trees 
are planted in several parks on 
the outskirts of Pittsburgh, in­
cluding North Park and South 
Park. Another program allows 
volunteers to rip up old, unused 
railroad tracks and turn them 
into bike trails in the “Rails to
Trails” Program. Railroad 
tracks are built on land with 
very low grade, and are easy to 
rip up. The land is already 
cleared and good for riding, and 
so the tracks are convenient for 
bike paths.
Transportation for most 
events is provided by Student 
Affairs, and Porter and Schwartz 
are currently in the process of 
sending out letters to the Greek 
community, athletic teams, resi­
dence hall floors, and all stu­
dent organizations. “We’re hop­
ing that this semester people 
enjoy it and foster its growth,” 
says Potter. “It should be a re­
warding experience for every 
person that takes part.”

Partners in Service program,

Cola perpetuates itself
Idioms become the tools of deception
“Have a Coke and a smile.” 
Since when does Coca-Cola 
equal happiness? Perhaps 
Coke provides some sensual 
pleasure I’m not aware of. Is 
Coca-Cola marketing itself 
through the promise of future 
happiness to be obtained by 
the purchase of its product? 
I’d believe it. Well, some of it. 
But that’s just one example of 
a stupid expression that 
caught on that no one really 
thought about.
Have you ever listened to 
yourself talk? Do you ever, as 
a way of saying goodbye, say 
“take it easy” or “don’t work 
too hard”? It seems strange 
that in a country where the 
Puritan work ethic is a laud­
able ideal, people say in place 
of “goodbye,” a phrase that 
amounts to “don’t achieve your 
full potential, just go home 
and sit in front of the televi­
sion.” Wasn’t the Jamestown 
Colony run on the principle 
that if you didn’t work, you 
didn’t eat? By those standards, 
if we all followed the advice of 
the “take it easy” crowd, we’d 
starve to death, and maybe 
rightly so.
Fortunately, I don’t think 
anyone has starved to death 
by “taking it easy.” It’s not 
only greetings that can sound 
stupid when you think about 
them, but most of the off-the- 
cuff expressions we use in ev­
eryday interaction with 
people.
Case in point: You’re walk­
ing down the Cut and you see 
one of your friends. You’re late 
for a lunch date and he or she 
is late for class. You pass say­
ing “Hey, John Jill Mark Anne 
Mary Henry, what’s up?”
No one really expects an an­
swer. In fact, most people 
would probably be a little con-
DRAGGED, KICKING & 
SCREAMING, INTO...
by Bob Dixon
fused or annoyed by someone 
who actually stopped to chat. 
(You’d say “What’re you, stu­
pid?” But only people who al­
ready think they know the an­
swer ever ask that question.)
So why do we ask? I suppose 
the answer is courtesy, but why 
that question? Why not “Hey, 
John Jill Mark Anne Mary 
Henry, nice to see you”? Would 
that show the real lack of con­
cern or time for the answer? 
Are these expressions just con­
structed to hide the fact that 
no one really cares anyway? 
Maybe these expressions are 
constructed and distributed by 
Coca-Cola to lull us into brain­
less, complacent happiness. 
Hmmmm. What do you think?
Has everyone said “see you 
later” to their linguistic senses? 
Drinking soda pop, analyzing 
the stock market, criticizing 
Oliver Stone’s latest film, and 
figuring out Norman Mailer’s 
latest book takes a lot of time 
out of everyday activities like 
thinking. No one really has 
any idea of when “later” is or 
any intention to make plans 
for when to have “later.” So, 
what’s the deal?
These expressions seem to 
be nasty little devices for con­
trolling social interaction. 
They get you into or out of 
situations. Hundreds of lines 
are used to initiate personal
interaction with the hope of 
initiating further, more per­
sonal social interaction. 
Think about it. What does 
“What’s a nice girl/boy like 
you doing in a place like this?” 
say about the speaker? “Hi, 
this is a really sleazy joint. I 
come here all the time but 
I’ve never seen you before. 
Would you like to go home 
with me because everyone 
else here has already rejected 
me.” The next morning, 
doesn’t “I’ll call you” really 
mean “I’ll call you. NOT”?
Speaking of “NOT,” where 
did this come from? An ex­
pression is constructed mean­
ing something completely 
contrary to the feelings of the 
speaker. This is the true mod­
ern language. Pepsi should 
paste this over all those new 
cans. Can you see it? Pepsi, 
NOT.
So, what does all this mean? 
According to this column, 
nothing at all. Language is 
an insincere, dishonest, ma­
nipulative device used by 
people and cola companies to 
accomplish their own ends. 
Therefore, if someone drinks 
Coke, Pepsi, or any other 
caramel-colored carbonated 
beverage; if someone asks you 
for a light at the bus stop; if 
someone can speak, write, or 
communicate in any way, 
shape, or form, don’t trust 
them. They’re either trying 
to get into your pants or into 
your wallet or into your re­
frigerator.
Or maybe they’re trying to 
plant futuristic spy devices 
in your bedroom.

NEW AWARDS FOR HISTORY MAJORS
The History Department is pleased to announce an expansion of its prizes for senior history 
majors. Each prize carries a cash award, and each is decided by a new undergraduate prize 
committee, composed of three faculty members, on recommendations from the faculty at 
large.
The Margaret Neff Award continues to go to the graduating history major with the best 
overall academic record.
The John Hope Franklin Award goes to the African-American, Asian-American, 
Hispanic-American, or Native American history major who demonstrates the greatest 
potential for graduate work in history or a related field. (Recipients need not, however, 
explicitly intend such a career.) This award is named for a distinguished African- 
American historian and honorary degree recipient from the University.
The Ludwig Schaefer Award for research in history goes to the senior history or 
interdisciplinary history major presenting the best research paper. Papers will be 
considered from coursework, seminars, or honors theses, as nominated by faculty or 
students. This award is named for a distinguished emeritus faculty member, long head of 
the department.
The Edwin Fenton Award for research in applied history goes to the senior with the best 
research papers in applied history. Papers will be considered from coursework, seminar, or 
honors theses, as nominated by faculty or students. This award is named for a 
distinguished teacher and educational innovator in the department.
All awards will be decided and announced at the end of the spring term, and will be 
.presented at a departmental awards ceremony shortly before Commencement.

together. Look at your assign­
ment book everyday and write 
your assignments everyday. 
Even if you don’t memorize 
what’s due and when, you’ll have 
that sneaking suspicion that will 
„ force you to look in that little red 
! book'

| projects, multiple problem sets, 
and huge pieces of art are due 
‘ the next day and the added as- 
! sistance of several packs of ciga-
¦ rettes. More serious changes are

Cigarettes, as everyone knows, 
’ are dangerous, and for the price 
of a pack, you can go out and buy 
an assignment book from the 
bookstore. You’ll save both 
money and damage to your 
Jungs. Write daily assignments

friend in each of your classes to 
do homework with. People seem 
; ^ss likely to forget a meeting, 
I ^specially when someone is 
; counting on them. You’ll get 
work done, you’ll have someone 
to bounce ideas off of, and if you 
do need to stay up late, it always 
seems easier to stay awake when 
you are not alone.
JOLT, PRAY FOR HELP 
fROM THE CMU GODS 
Jolt Cola has to be a NASA 
! exPerimental rocket fuel gone 
¡1 awry. This is not a drink for
lightweights. If you enter start 
with Jolt and try to take a catna 
on the third consecutive day of 
wakefulness, you’ll bounce out 
of the bed and end up skittering 
around on the floor, keeping your 
roommate awake.
At this point, you really have 
to step back and take a hard look 
at what you’re doing. If you’re 
staying awake for days on end, 
it’s time to take a look at how 
much planning (if any) you are 
doing and how much planning is 
required to be successful. If you 
have an assignment book or 
know what one is, use it and look 
ahead one week for each day. 
This way, you’re not surprised 
by big projects the night before 
they’re due. This is also a good 
time to consider the Counseling 
Center. If you’re having a prob­
lem managing your time on your 
own, they could help you to set 
up a workable and livable time 
management system. 
AMPHETAMINES
These are uncool and definitely 
dangerous. Amphetamines in­
clude diet pills, prescription 
drugs, and the old classic speed. 
These are ways of staying awake, 
although the things done to your 
body are not worth the extra few 
hours of wakefulness. Here you 
need to stop dead in your tracks 
before speed does it for you. An 
assignment book is pointless at 
this point; most people fall into 
routines in the things they do, 
and drugs like amphetamines
work themselves into a very big, 
controlling pattern. The Coun­
seling Center is probably the 
only place to go at this point, if 
you’re not sure about going, have 
a friend you trust go with you. 
They’d rather spend the after­
noon in an office than in the 
hospital.
If you’ve read through all of 
this you may have an idea of the 
quantities of chemicals it takes 
to break resolution number 
three. There are other alterna­
tives to the caffeine time man­
agement system. Invest in one 
of the bookstore’s, godlike aca­
demic planners, and use it even 
after you write in all the dead­
lines in the first week,The Coun­
seling Center can help to set up 
a program which is livable. If 
you have to, drop a class or two 
to lessen your workload. No 
matter how well you plan, if 
you’ve taken on more than you 
can handle, you’re probably not 
going to accomplish anything at 
all. Remember, CMU is a place, 
not an ideal. If you can’t do some­
thing, you can’t do something. 
Say “screw it” and go to bed.

you, stop reading and go to any 
Waldenbooks store — they’ll 
take care of you.
Stone Wall Book Store is a 
short walk from campus, half­
hidden in the basement of 732 
Filbert Street, just off Walnut in 
Shadyside. It’s the place with 
the red canopy and granite sid­
ing-
Stone Wall manages to pack 
at least twice the selection in 
half the space of your ordinary 
Waldenbooks store. If you are 
wondering exactly what we 
mean by this statement, Stone 
Wall doesn’t carry Ronald 
Reagan’s autobiography and 
Waldenbooks doesn’t carry 
Anaïs Nin’s diaries.
A quick tour of Stone Wall 
uncovers section titles like My­
thology and Religion, Women’s 
Stories, Criticism (literary and 
otherwise), Philosophy, Music, 
and Dance. Stone Wall also car­
ries a large selection of Pitts­
burgh-related books, cookbooks, 
and new and popular fiction. (At 
Stone Wall, this list is not ex­
haustive; at Waldenbooks, it 
would be.)
Although the selection for a 
store its size is excellent, a few 
sections stand out. You know 
the puny Literature selection at 
Waldenbooks? The one with two 
and a half book shelves filled
with nothing but The Great 
Gatsby, The Sun Also Rises, all 
the famous Shakespeare plays, 
the dead romantic poets, and 
that thing entitled The Prophet?
(A side note; it never ceases to 
amaze us that some places man­
age to cram literary novels, 
plays, and poetry all into one 
space the size of a good glove 
compartment and consider the 
attempt adequate. Must be they 
need all the space for Kitty 
Kelly’s next masterpiece.)
At Stone Wall, plays and po­
etry have their own shelves, and 
the Literature section alone cov­
ers an entire wall, with every 
book that was banned in Boston 
in the last 200 years. SeveraL of 
the authors found here are still 
living. Oh, and they have all 
those books Fitzgerald and 
Heming-way wrote too.
The other standout is the 
Children’s section. Although the 
section is very small, someone 
obviously spent a lot of time re­
searching which children’s books 
are actually worth buying, and 
then put them on the shelf.
There isn’t a slouch book here, 
which is good to know since the 
children’s market tries to bleed 
everybody dry by charging at 
least twice the price an adult 
book would cost. These books 
are perfect for college students 
trying to squeeze a little plea­
sure-reading in. May we sug­
gest Frog- and Toad are Friends, 
by Arnold Jobel. We think this is 
much better than Pat the Bunny, 
a Waldenbooks selection.
We were slightly disappointed 
by the fact that Stone Wall had 
only one bookshelf devoted to 
Sex (under the Women’s section, 
for those interested). Still, we 
suppose one shelf is better than 
none.
The last time we visited Stone 
Wall, the shelves were a bit bare. 
This happens from time to time 
because people actually buy 
books there. They tend to re­
stock frequently, however, so if 
you venture in and don’t find 
what you’re looking for, either 
come back in a week or so, or ask 
at the desk if they could order it 
for you. They’ll be happy to pro­
vide this service, unlike Wal­
denbooks, which feels that if it’s 
not on their shelves, it can’t be 
very important.
Stone Wall is not the begin­
ning and end of all book stores. 
Still, its selection and conve­
nience single it out as perhaps 
the best all-around book store 
for students without vehicles. 
Check it out on the way to wher­
ever you go on Walnut. What­
ever you do, don’t hop on the bus 
to Monroeville in search of 
Waldenbooks. It’sjust not worth 
the bus fare.
DIETARY, from LI 
Morewood Cafeteria
Morewood Cafeteria, tradi­
tionally the most popular 
Mariott-subsidized eatery on 
campus, features the nutritious 
and delicious deli daily, which is 
sure to please any non-vegetar­
ian. Morewood Cáfeteria’s deli 
offers a wider selection of cold 
cuts than does the deli at the 
Highlander Café, although the 
fittest choice of meat at almost 
any deli is the turkey. And tur­
key on whole wheat bread is 
protein-packed, with as little fat 
as you’ll find in a meat sand­
wich. But remember to hold that 
mayo as well as various other 
condiments.
The hamburgers served at
Morewood are not as fatty as the 
Tartan Grill’s hamburgers be­
cause Morewood’s don’t contain 
red meat, but soybeans. So for 
you hamburger lovers who want 
to stay trim, have no guilt when 
eating soybean burgers at 
Morewood Cafeteria.
Salads Plus 
Because the mainstay of Sal­
ads Plus is its salads, we need go 
no further than this half of Kiltie 
Court to find a myriad of nutri­
tional edibles. The salads are 
more adventurous in their top­
pings than at other campus salad 
bars, and the potential for cre­
ative salad-making seems un­
limited. Salads’ low-fat frozen 
yogurt is healthier than ice 
cream available from other
CMDS distribution points, and 
because new flavors are served 
everyday, the frozen yogurt re­
mains appetizing day after day.
When looking for the most 
harmless menu items around, 
stay away from most foods they 
prepare. Stick to the meals you 
assemble yourself. Individuals 
would be wise to make an amend­
ment to the nutrition resolution 
that dictates setting up a tent 
outside Salads Plus during the 
school week. You might freeze to 
death, but at least you’ll be 
healthy.

In the latest rash of thefts, the group known as Susan Stephans Security 
has again aidsd the police by capturing the crooks red handed. Though their 
methods are unorthodox , questionable, and sometimes lethal, they have 
brought aims in the streets of Baltimore to an all-time low. In fact, their activity 
along the East Coast, from Boston to Miami, has lowered normal crime rates in 
all of the major cities. However, superpowered crimes are on the rise.
ÎWe can only hope that more supsrheroes will kom^owarc^ndhel^he_you2^msadersof 3S.

DIVERSIONS
CMU opera resounds in Street Scene
gy MEGAN DIETZ
Tartan Contributing Editor
\ can still remember my first opera. I 
was eleven years old, and one of my 
eventh-grade teachers thought it 
vould be a good idea for a bunch of kids 
> with her to see The Barber of 
foville in Cleveland. My adolescent 
mentality just couldn’t seem to connect
0 the stout, rosy-cheeked men and 
vomen on stage singing in Italian 
ibout God-knows-what. The distances 
vere too great and I didn’t feel like 
trying to bridge them. So I took a nap.
Since then, I’ve developed more of an 
appreciation for opera; I’ve come to 
¡njoy the very things that made me so 
ndifferent when I was younger. What 
really makes opera special for me is the 
complete reliance on the musical and 
dramatic aspects of the performance. 
Since there is usually a language bar­
rier between American audiences and 
he operas they attend, there is a bur­
den on the performers to convey their 
:haracters through their singing and 
visual performances.
In the CMU Music Department’s 
Itreet Scene, the performers, for the 
most part, make the connection with 
.he audience very well. Their energetic 
musical styles and stage presences al­
ow them to do so. But the show itself 
»resents a problem — it’s set in mid- 
20th century New York City, in front of 
a brownstone, Number 346, and it’s 
written in decidedly American English; 
lowever, it still retains the almost ex- 
:essive style of traditional foreign op­
era. The melodrama is somehow won­
derful in operas which are foreign to us 
in their language, geography, and time 
period, but it just doesn’t work in a 
modern American setting. The “oper­
atic” excesses don’t seem strangely 
jeautiful; they just seem excessive.
The plot of Street Scene revolves
Spotlight: Music
around four main characters: Mr. 
Maurrant, a cold husband and father; 
Mrs. Maurrant, his gentle but dissatis­
fied wife; Rose Maurrant, their daugh­
ter, who loves her family but wants to 
get out; and Sam Kaplan, a sensitive 
law student who loves Rose and la­
ments the dreariness of his life. The 
other tenants of the brownstone figure 
heavily into the opera, as well, from the 
catty (but funny) Mrs. Jones to the 
joyous Lippo Fiorentino.
Mrs. Maurrant, at the start of the 
show, is suspected by her neighbors of 
having an affair with Mr. Sanke, the 
collector for the milk company. This 
has obviously put added strain on the 
Maurrants’ marriage, and Mr. 
Maurrant appears to be an ogre. By the 
end of the first act, Rose and Sam are in 
love and the gossip on the block has 
raised to a feverish pitch. In the second 
act, a major tragedy occurs which af­
fects the four main characters forever, 
but by the end of the show, the building 
is back to normal and life goes on as 
usual, for better and for worse.
Despite the strangeness of the opera’s 
concept, Street Scene gives the audi­
ence an awful lot to love. The charac­
ters are a wonderful, lively bunch of 
folks, and you would have no trouble 
imagining them sitting on a stoop in
the summer, gossiping about whoever 
is not present at the time.
The music is really quite beautiful 
when it avoids slipping into sappiness. 
The opening song, “Ain’t it Awful, the 
Heat?” sets an everyday tone for the 
show quickly and with a lot of style, 
though the everyday-ness of the show 
soon goes out the window. Another 
number, “Ice Cream Sextet,” is a won­
derful tune in which the residents of 
the brownstone break into joyous song 
when a neighbor brings them all ice 
cream cones. “Moon Faced, Starry Eyed” 
is a great song-and-dance number. And 
the second act opener, “Catch Me If You 
Can,” is a precious piece of work, sung 
by eight of the greatest little kids I’ve 
ever seen on stage.
CMU’s production of this opera is 
exceptional. Director Janet Bookspan 
does a great job of illuminating the 
script with her staging, and musical
director Robert Page’s magical influ­
ence can certainly be felt in the show.
Each member of the 45-person cast 
does an impressive job. Second-year 
graduate student Angela Hobbs is won­
derful as Mrs. Maurrant. Her singing 
and acting are right on the money. 
Senior Luisa TedofFs Rose is incredibly 
strong both musically and dramati­
cally; she saves Rose from being a ste­
reotypical ingenue and instead gives us 
a young woman of great strength. Dillon 
McCartney, a senior who appeared in 
The Marriage of Figaro last year, gives 
a believable and beautifully sung per­
formance of a somewhat cliched char­
acter, Sam Kaplan. Stephen Totter, a 
second-year graduate student, sings 
wonderfully in his role as Mr. Maurrant 
—I was impressed that he could sing so 
well with a New York accent. But 
Totter’s dramatic performance seemed 
stilted, almost as if he were afraid to
use his face and body to portray the !• 
character.
Several supporting characters are ;; 
worth noting, too. Junior Theo Fried is j; 
fantastic as the two-faced but likable i; 
Mrs. Jones. Her performance is witty j; 
but not merely a caricature. James j: 
Flick, a junior, shines in his double role I. 
of Mr. Jones and his good-for-nothing i'. 
son Vincent. Stephen Phillips, a gradu- ! 
ate student, is hysterical as first-floor ¦ 
Italian tenant Lippo Fiorentino. The ¦ 
exuberance he injects into the show is '¦ 
priceless. Though senior Lawrence ; 
Street (Dick McGann) and junior N ancy ;; 
Balach (Mae J ones) have only one num- 
ber, they make it memorable. A strong 
sense of community could be felt ¡! 
throughout the show: this cast is not .• 
just made up of talented individuals— ;¦ 
it is an ensemble.
Technically, the show runs smoothly. : 
The set is impressive and goes quite a j; 
way in enhancing the feeling of commu- I 
nity on stage. The costumes are nice; !' 
they ground the show in a specific time ! 
and place without drawing too much 1 
attention to themselves. The lighting I 
works well, for the most part; the • 
streetlight on the stage is a nice touch. • 
The only technical problem deals with 
the audio feedback which concerns Mrs. 
Fiorentino, played by senior Tanya 
Stum. I couldn’t hear her when she'sat ; 
in the first-floor window, as she did for ’ 
much of the show. Perhaps a micro­
phone there would help the audience to > 
hear her lilting soprano voice.
I’d have to say that the Music 1 
Department’s production ofStreet Scene »; 
is definitely worth the ticket price, the 
length (it runs a little over two and a ;! 
half hours), and the walk to the Win- ;! 
ston-Thurston School on the corner of 
Morewood and Ellsworth. Although the ' 
operatic flavor given to everyday life ¦ 
tastes a little strange, there’s certainly ; 
a lot to bite into.
80s Veejay talks trivia in Skibo Ballroom
By ALISON GREEN
Tartan Contributing Editor
Last Thursday, Martha Quinn, one 
of the original five VJs for MTV, spoke 
in Skibo Ballroom about MTV and the 
effect it has had on popular culture and 
the music industry.
Quinn is the quintessential MTV per­
sonality. She was vibrant, amusing and 
¡riendly. She spoke at length about the 
origins and evolution of MTV, and 
proved her command of music trivia by 
challenging the audience to head-to- 
1 trivia contests throughout the 
presentation.
But in contrast to that, she also gave 
:he audience an example of the effect 
that MTV has had on commercials by 
doing a dance we could expect to see 
nowadays for a product as common­
place as cleanser. The dance was, as 
any male who was there will tell you, 
anything but commonplace.
What does this mean about Quinn, 
tnen? The answer is simple; she is the
Tracy Kroop/Tartan Staff Photographer 
VJ6jj CunJuC R4n CuJee ij CuIh4P
combination of pop culture and music 
savvy that made MTV what it is today. 
She came across as a witness to the 
advent of music television, a spokes­
person for the cable channel that be­
came a movement that helped shape 
the generation of which almost every 
CMU student is a member.
After the presentation, Quinn an­
swered questions about herself, music, 
MTV, and the future of all three. When 
asked about coming music video trends, 
Quinn harkened back to the beginnings 
of music video.
“When video music started, it was 
very visually oriented. I think people 
were so excited to have things on cam­
era like locations, girls, and costumes 
... a visual of the song,” said Quinn. 
“Then there was a real backlash against 
that, to real simple videos like Van 
Halen’s ‘Jump,’ and now [music videos] 
are kind of coming back to incorporat­
ing stories again.”
Quinn went on to say that music 
videos might even be evolving into 
something we have yet to see. “Peter
Gabriel’ once said that video music is 
like AM-radio right now. Somebody’s 
going to come along and record [the 
video equivalent of the Beaties’] Sgt. 
Pepper, which will usher in the FM 
generation. And I don’t know what that 
might be.... Video is still new.”
She mentioned that MTV has plans 
in the works for expanding into three 
separate channels which would each 
cover a certain kind of music. “In 1993, 
MTV one, two, and three,” said Quinn. 
“We only have twenty-four hours, and 
we’ve got to fit in Guns ’N’ Roses, M.C. 
Hammer, Nirvana ... and that’s not 
that much time.” The stations would 
each take a different format; for in­
stance, one station could cover alterna­
tive music while another station cov­
ered street music.
The new ground that MTV is about to 
break is enough to make us wonder — 
will artists like Madonna and Michael 
Jackson survive? What will the music 
of the future sound like? And most 
importantly: Who will be the 
MarthaQuinn of the ’90s?

Warren Zevon muzzles bowlings on latest release
By MIKE SHAPIRO

^ Walk into a crowded room and say 
Warren Zevon,” and chances are that 
everyone will start shrieking and coo- 
ng as if you caught all their fingers in 
3 door. Don’t dial 911 — they’re merely 
tying to emulate the telltale musical 
howl from the immortal classic, 
Werewolves of London.”
Mr. Zevon belongs to the small collec- 
,'°n of low-key musical celebrities who 
ave impressed upon our generation a 
J1:ngle song of such merit that it suffices
0 sustain their fame throughout what- 
!ver mediocrity they subsequently pro- 
uce. A side effect of this is a sort of 
Cached sense of goodwill elicited by 
mention of their name.
Warren Zevon? Oh, sure, 
erewolves of London’, right?” And 
lhen the howl.
? One can imagine that Mr. Zevon has 
’°ne through so many earplugs with- 
! anding these shrill tributes that he’s

been driven to producing more albums 
in a desperate attempt to replace his 
quintessential hit. Surprisingly, with 
his recent effort, Mr. Bad Example, he 
may have been successful.
Pop in the CD and speed to the title 
track. You’ll run through it at least 
eight or nine times before you listen to 
the rest of the album — and probably 
flip right back to it after you do. “Mr. 
Bad Example” is the catchiest, most 
upbeat, and downright funniest en­
shrinement of hedonistic decadence 
ever written. Trumpets blare, snare 
drums rattle, and those three chords 
that have preoccupied Western music- 
lovers since time immemorial march by 
in full glory. This is easily a classic.
Just sample some of the lyrics: “I’m 
very well acquainted with the seven
deadly sins/I keep a busy schedule just 
trying to fit them in.” Can you stand it? 
After your fifteenth listen you’ll be re­
citing the lyrics compulsively, which 
may help you regain the friends you’ve 
driven away while ululating 
“Werewolves of London” in their ears.
Oh, yes, there is 
one other good song.
“Angel Dressed in 
Black,” is a passion­
ate lament towards 
an oft-absent, night­
life-skulking loved 
one. The chorus is 
emphatic and mov­
ing, but the sound 
quality is so muddy 
and garbled that one 
is left to wonder 
whether or not the 
audio engineer had an opposable thumb. 
(In one verse two lines are completely 
left silent except for the last word, and 
the lyric booklet makes no mention of 
this omission.)
The rest of the album is, to use a 
technical critic’s term, ehhh. Mr. Zevon’s 
voice is low and unnerving, suggesting 
that the main cause of this album is a 
lull in the bank-robbing industry. The 
lyrics are generally bland, dark, and 
cynical, with a few touching artistic 
asides such as “You can 
screw everybody I’ve 
ever known/But I still 
won’t talk to you on the 
phone.”
“Finishing Touches,” 
is spartan but palatable, 
largely owing to the in­
teresting vocal harmony. 
“Suzie Lightning,” is a 
lilting, incoherent love 
tribute with cosmic over­
tones of dissatisfaction. 
“Model Citizen” is a slug­
gish, watered-down echo of the title 
track, and not a fraction as catchy. 
“Heartache Spoken Here” is an 
unforgivable lapse into the sort of ste­
reotypical country song that only exists

in beer commercials and old Ricochet ! 
Rabbit cartoons. And “Things To Do In 1

can see, a clever title.

in our culture’s screeching, agonized, ¦

Marvel Comics fattens itself on fans
They say “past is prologue” 
and when that french hoss said 
cipres moi le deluge who knew 
that his prophecy would affect 
the comics world hundreds of 
years after his demise? Deluge 
is the word for it, fellow comic 
readers, for Marvel is gearing 
up to release more than two 
hundred titles a month upon 
the baby new year. How to deal 
with this situation?
Of course, one will have to 
decide for oneself which new 
books are worth all that cash, 
but here are my opinions on 
whether this will herald a dy­
namic new period of excitement 
or the next ice age for comics. It 
doesn’t look too exciting folks. In 
fact, it seems as if Marvel has 
poised itself for a carboyhydrate 
gorge-fest.
If you enjoy such high-calorie, 
fast-food mush like The Pun­
isher and “supernatural” thrill­
ers like Ghost Rider, then relax! 
Marvel is going to deliver for 
your dining pleasure a veritable 
cornucopia of Punisher and 
Ghost Rider-esque clones. What 
a massive waste of talent! An 
expansion with such potential! I 
hope that Marvel suffers a ma­
jor coronary and learns a valu­
able lesson from the buying pub­
lic that if they insist on follow­
ing the same paths paved by 
pathetic network television, they 
too will suffer the ignomonious 
fate that those bloated giants 
are currently suffering. By wor­
shipping the god of demograph­
ics and subsequently creating 
products for the average reader, 
this mega-company is churning 
out mega-average books. This is 
definitely not the first time this 
argument has been made, but it 
is important to keep on making 
it till the buying public sends
COMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
the message to huge corporate 
giants like Marvel that they can­
not continue to remain stagnant. 
They most likely will get the 
message when they’re on their 
deathbed, but no one wants that.
I believe Marvel is fully con­
scious of their mortality; thus, 
the motivation behind this mas­
sive expansion. Yet by releasing 
hundreds of titles they are not 
expanding upwards, they are 
only growing fatter.
Upcoming low-lights include 
another Ghost Rider and Pun­
isher title. More super violent 
new characters, a month called 
“Big Guns” celebrating this in­
sanity, and a ton of science-fic- 
tion schlock that is essentially 
more Punishers with “high-tech” 
gadgets under the creative con­
trol of a ton of second-string tal­
ent. One of the absuridities in­
clude a Beverly Hills 90210 title 
and an adaptation of William 
Shatner’s (!) sci-fi stupidity Tek 
World. A ridiculous new family 
of titles under the larger head­
ing of “Rise of the Midnight 
Sons” includes more Ghost-Rider 
clones such as the title called 
Terror Inc. about a supernatu­
ral Armani assasin who can steal 
body parts of people. Gak! This 
book and many others are writ­
ten and produced by more sec­
ond stringers than you can shake 
a stick at.
But in all fairness, these sec-
ond-stringers deserve a chance. 
For the first time in their young 
careers they are being given full 
command of their own titles and 
perhaps they will pleasantly 
surprise. Maybe miraculously 
Marvel will turn the violence/ 
horror schlock genre into an en­
grossing and surprisingly re­
freshing form of comic litera­
ture. Nyet!
But wait, there are some 
projects out of the zillion or so 
that show glimmers of promise 
(after all it is rather difficult to 
go 0 for 200!). Does a line of 
books set in the year 2093 sound 
interesting? Dr. Doom, 
Spiderman, Punisher (sigh), and 
some completely new all violent 
Punisher clone will all get their 
own books in this future uni­
verse. Kind of a neat concept, 
but again it seems to be a simple 
rehashing of the same dish 
served with a different sauce. 
No creative teams have been 
announced as of yet, but chances 
are they will be most likely be 
second or third stringers as well.
The line of horror books has 
a couple of titles with potential. 
From the art team of Doom Pa­
trol and a writer I never heard 
of (Christian Cooper) comes a 
monthly $1.75 book called 
Darkhold: Pages from the Book 
of Sins. Instead of a Ghost Rider 
clone, it’ll probably be a Dr. 
Strange clone, which therefore 
couldn’t be that bad. 
Nightstalkers, using the cast of 
characters from the recent Tomb 
ofDracula series, tells the tale 
of a bunch of psycho ghost bust­
ers. It has a decent writer and 
artist, but of course it too will be 
priced at the ultra high price of 
$1.75.
A revival of Luke Cage from 
his days of Powerman and Iron
If you enjoy such high-calorie, fast-food mush like The 
Punisher and “supernatural” thrillers like Ghost Rider, 
then relax!
Fist should be out in a few 
weeks. Untested writers and 
artists head this book that will 
fall under the “Big Guns” family 
of books. Luke Cage was a re­
freshing character years ago who 
grew stale and was eventually 
cancelled. As Marvel’s only black 
hero with a continuing title, 
maybe he will become interest­
ing again. Nomad should be out 
in a few weeks as well. This 
book deals with the supporting 
character who has appeared off 
and on in Captain America the 
past few years. It is the story of 
a journeyman hero who wan­
ders all across America. The 
twist? He’s been frozen in sus­
pended animation for thirty or 
so years. Seeing a vision of 
America through his eyes should 
prove to be interesting. A sequel 
to the fun filled Infinity Gaunt-

let is also in the works by the 
deft writer Jim Starlin and his 
accomplice in art, Ron Lim. It’ll 
be called The Infinity Wars and 
be something like Invasion of 
the Super Hero Snatchers.
So, you think regardless of this 
massive expansion, Marvel’s 
strong core of mutant and tradi­
tional super hero titles will serve 
as a safety net? Maybe not, for 
rumor has it some major storm 
clouds are gathering on the ho­
rizon. Marvel’s current power­
house lineup could potentially 
be in some real trouble. Todd 
McFarlane, who has already left 
the company months ago, along 
with incredibly popular (and 
talented) X-artists like Rob 
Liefield (X-Force, 501 Blues 
ads!), Whilce Portacio, and X- 
Men artist/plotter Jim Lee are 
said to be forming their own
label! Published rumors fron 
reliable sources say that these 
“super” stars may join up wit] 
an independent Organizatioi 
and start their own line of titles 
What’s the motivation behint 
such a potential coup? Money o 
course! According to this repor 
by Chuck Rosanaski, presiden 
of Mile High Comics in Denver 
Jim Lee et al. are unhappy wit] 
the money they’re getting ant 
want more. Will greed lead t< 
the fall of comics civilization' 
Stay tuned, the story behind tht

interesting than anythingyouT 
find in a comic book.

THE SHAMEN
En-Tact
????
It’s really kinda funny the way 
the global music industry works. 
Europe won’t-release anything 
across the Atlantic without mak­
ing sure it’s a hit. No exception 
to this rule is the first domestic 
release of The Shamen’s “cur-
• rent” album, En-Tact. The copy­
right date says ©1991 Sony Mu­
sic Entertainment, so why do I 
have Shamen 12"s of first re­
lease “Move Any Mountain 
(Progen 91)” and the current 
release “Make It Mine” dated 
1990? Well, The Shamen came 
out with the European En-Tact 
near the beginning of 1990, and 
the major singles got over here 
to the clubs as imports. .
Now, The Shamen have gone 
back into the studio, remixed 
and re-edited everything, and 
released it domestically on Epic 
records. But what do I care of 
the greedy global music scene? I 
am but a simple DJ who gets a 
bunch of new mixes to play 
with. There are 15 tracks on this 
disc, totalling over 60 minutes of 
la surprising mix of hi-energy 
(iance and technotrance. Excel­
lent trance tracks include 
^Omega Amigo,” “Evil is Even,” 
and “Lightspan.” Aside from the 
two released singles, some good 
dance tracks are “Possible 
Worlds,” and “Human NRG.” 
There are also a few remixes on 
the album as well. One definitely 
not to pass up is “666 Edit,” a 
very different remix of “Move 
Any Mountain.”

HEAVY D AND 
THE BOYZ
Peaceful Journey
? ???
The Heavster has done it 
again. I’m talking about the big 
and beautiful Heavy D of the 
popular rap group Heavy D and 
the Boyz. His latest CD, Peace­
ful Journey, has proven itself to 
be an excellent sequel to his last 
hit album, Big Tyme.
Peaceful Journey came slam­
ming onto the charts with its 
two smash hit singles, “Now that 
We’ve Found Love,” and “Is it 
Good to You.” This relaxed, yet 
very well-organized album is a 
perfect reflection of the style 
Heavy emits. No funky fat, fake 
gold chains andNikeshere folks.

shoes for size!
As far as the actual content of 
the album, there is a medley of 
hip-hop, jazz, and fun rap. But 
don’t take this album lightly just 
because it isn’t hardcore, because 
its lyrics and beats are indeed 
solid to the core. It boasts such 
tracks as “Sister Sister,” a trib­
ute to the “sistas” everywhere. 
This is Heavy’s way of saying 
thanks to the strong black 
women who stand behind the 
successful black men of today. 
Also look for “Don’t Curse,” an 
admonishing shout-out to those 
who wish to censor rap. There is 
also the jazz lovers remix of the 
popular song, (only available on 
CD), “Somebody for Me,” which 
hails from his last album.
The best track is by far “Peace­
ful Journey.” Heavy raps about 
lost loved ones over an excellent 
sample of “This Place Hotel,” a 
song from the ’70s. What makes 
this song poignant is that it is a 
tribute to the late Trouble T- 
Roy, a former dancer and long­
time friend of Heavy, who died 
in a fatal accident.
Heavy’s lyrical skills and cre­
ative sampling compel you to 
pump your fist as you scramble 
to the dance floor to work up a 
sweat from his latest jam. So 
check out Peaceful Journey as 
well as his previous albums — 
they’re definitely worth the 
money!

NED'S ATOMIC 
DUSTBIN
God Fodder
? ??72
The recent genre of music — 
the totally electronic, the semi- 
electronic, and the non-elec- 
tronic (aka racy guitar chords at 
every chance) is nothing but 
unexciting. For the past two 
years, we have been bombarded 
with the music of young British 
boys like Jesus Jones and EMF. 
Although their music possesses 
much energy that drive many of 
us out onto the dance floor, they 
never made any meaningful 
statements thatdrove us to re­
peat the lyrics outside of the 
shower. Ned’s Atomic Dustbin 
is travelling down a different 
path.
Although their latest release 
God Fodder, has been on the 
market for a while, Ned’s Atomic 
Dustbin are just beginning to 
gain recognition.
God Fodder’s most-played 
singles right now are “Grey C ells 
Green,” which discusses envi­
ronmental problems, and “Kill 
Your Television.” Both are high- 
powered songs with a hard edge. 
The vocals are hard-driven 
against the fast paced guitar riffs 
and somewhat primitive drum 
beat in the background. Other 
songs, such as “Selfish” and 
“Happy,” are also strong cuts 
enticing many to stamp their 
feet instead of doing foxtrot­
like dance moves to Donna
THE PRINCE 
OF TIDES
? ??72
In Pat Conroy’s touching 
novel-turned-film The Prince of 
Tides, director Barbra Streisand 
delicately balances the tension 
between her duties and desires, 
long term happiness, and 
ephemeral glory. Starring 
Streisand and Nick Nolte, the 
film explores gender roles in the 
past and present and re-evalu­
ates the role of marriage and 
family in the lives of contempo­
rary Americans.
At the base of the movie, Nolte 
plays Tom Wingo, an unem­
ployed college football coach liv­
ing with his wife and three

Summer’s “Hot Stuff.” 
Although Ned’s Atomic 
Dustbin may be in the same cat­
egory as Nirvana in terms of 
“guitar quality,” the distinct 
English accent of the lead vocal­
ist keeps them on the alterna­
tive scene.
Expect to see a lot more of 
these guys. God Fodder is only 
the beginning.

daughters in a beautiful beach 
home in Charleston, South Caro­
lina. When Nolte’s mother pays 
the Wingo family a visit, Nolte 
learns that his twin sister Sa­
vannah, a writer in New York 
City, has attempted suicide — 
again. At the request of 
Savannah’s psychiatrist, played 
by Streisand, Nolte flies to New 
York and serves as Savannah’s 
“memory,” filling in the parts of 
his sister’s, life that she has 
blocked out.
Over the course of six weeks 
an array of twists and turns, 
(none of which are particularly 
surprising), transform Nolte 
from a guy who is an emotional 
wreck on the inside, with a mar­
riage crumbling to the carpet, to 
a man who has shed his humili­
ating past, thrown away his emo­
tional garbage, and healed his 
wounds. With the help of 
Streisand, Nolte renews his un­
derstanding of love and of “fam­
ily values.”
Nolte’s performance is golden, 
just like his refreshing tan. 
Watching his gentle bigness is a 
welcome break from watching 
Streisand’s sword-like finger­
nails. His character’s most un­
easy moments are effective in 
their subtlety.
Streisand’s acting is classic- 
Streisand. Not that it is her best 
performance, it is just the per­
formance one would expect of 
her. Her character shows the 
signs of a woman who grew up in 
a female-suppressed world, but 
who has freed herself from the 
arbitrary constraints society has 
placed around her.
— Amy Potthast
GRAND CANYON 
????
As I sat watching Lawrence 
Kasdan’s latest effort, Grand 
Canyon, I knew exactly what he 
was trying to do. I could plainly 
see him taking the audience on 
an emotional roller coaster, 
strapping us tightly in our seats, 
and never letting the ride stop. 
One second you’re happy, the 
next you’re confused, the next 
minute you’re sad, and the next 
you’re wondering how on earth 
we even survive on this planet 
from day to day. Kasdan throws 
literally hundreds of loose emo­
tions into our faces in the span of 
only two hours and expects us to 
digest them, analyze them, and 
remember them.
The only problem I had with 
this emotional thrill ride was 
that I didn’t feel as if I were one 
of the passengers. Grand Can­
yon focuses mainly on the 
fortysomething generation, not 
the twentysomething genera­
tion. Even though I could relate 
to most of the film, there was 
still a lot that I couldn’t fully 
appreciate because I have yet to 
experience those situations in 
my life. I felt that my parents 
would have gotten a lot more out 
of this film than I did.
Another problem with 
Kasdan’s film is the amount of 
images and situations he throws 
at the audience. Because of the 
monumental task he’s trying to 
pull off — showing every aspect 
of life in only two hours — some 
of his ideas completely miss 
their mark. You almost feel like 
an intruder during the awkward 
moments in the film.
However, there are only a few 
of these uneven moments, and 
when Kasdan takes his time to 
convey a message or feeling, such
as the scene in which Kevin Kline 
is about mugged by some inner- 
city hoodlums or when Steve 
Martin gets shot. The result 
arechilling, wonderful, frighten­
ing, and remarkable all at the 
same time.
The acting in Grand Canyon 
is outstanding, which is partially 
due to the star-filled cast. Kline, 
Mary McDonnell, Danny Gloyer, 
and Martin are all first-cl&'ss 
actors who display some of tEeir 
best work here. Kasdan’s straaig 
script and ability in developing 
three dimensional character also 
helped a lot.
Grand Canyon is a good film, 
but I imagine that in twenty 
years from now, when I can re­
late to the characters and their 
situations a bit better, that it 
will be an even better film.
— Stephen Glicker
FATHER OF 
THE BRIDE
? ??
Even though the recenCre- 
make of Father of the Bride may 
seem like a movie for midcSe- 
aged parents only, it has appeal 
for college-age students as well.
It tells the story of Geotge 
Banks (Steve Martin) who has 
to deal with his daughter, Annie 
(Kimberly Williams), growingup 
and getting married.
The movie begins with Annie 
arriving home from Europe 
where she studied architecture 
and met Bryan McKenzie 
(George Newbern), her fiance. 
On the day of her arrival ^he 
tells her family about himlSad 
informs them that he is coming 
to visit. When George ancCKis 
wife Nina (Diane Keaton) first 
meet Bryan, George’s facial ex­
pressions make the scene.
The rest of George’s trials and 
tribulations involve paying.for 
the wedding and mobilizingftis 
house for the reception. ThiSrn- 
cludes dealing with the musEeii- 
mouth wedding manager played 
by Martin Short.
Father of the Bride depends 
heavily on Martin’s narrations 
and facial expressions. It isn’t as 
good as Parenthood, which had 
similar humor and conflicts, but 
it’s still worth seeing Martin in 
front of the camera.

Innovative, daring, electrify­
ing, and creative are only a few 
óf the many ways to describe 
the Limón Dance Company’s 
style. Founded by the late José 
Limón, one of the principle cho­
reographers of America’s mod­
ern dance, the Limón Dance 
Company exists as one of today’s 
two senior modern dance com­
panies in the world. The 
company’s current artistic di­
rector, Carla Maxwell, contin­
ues to expand upon Limón’s work 
and integrate his ideas into new 
works which are included in the 
Company’s repertoire. The group 
will perform at the Fulton The­
atre on January 31.
Internationally recognized for 
performances in over thirty 
countries, the Limón Dance 
Çompany had the honor in 1954 
óf becoming the first group to 
tour under the State Depart­
ment’s Cultural Exchange Pro­
gram. Since then, the company 
lias performed in many impor­
tant State Department spon­
sored tours in places from the 
Soviet Union to the White House.
With the creative works of 
Limón and other choreogra­
phers, there will be a variety of 
styles to experience at the Fulton 
Theatre. Under the direction of 
Ivlaxwell, the Limón Dance Com­
pany will certainly gain recogni­
tion here in Pittsburgh. Three 
pieces will be performed by the 
group at the Fulton — 
“[Tanzlieder,” “The Unsung ” and 
“¡Retablos”.
Opening the performance will 
be “Tanzlieder,” a piece created 
tiy Annabelle Gamson. Inspired 
by the German expressionist 
modérn dance pioneer Mary 
Wigman and the works of 
Isadora Duncan, Gamson 
molded her piece to examine the 
“feminine” side of choreography. 
The piece is created by a woman,

modern dance company performs

for women. It emphasizes femi­
nine nature. Gamson’s desire to 
integrate love and affirmation 
into this work offers a serene 
and lyrical view of the art form.
Danced solely by men, “The 
Unsung” is one of the many 
works of José Limón. It was cre­
ated as a homage to great Na­
tive American leaders. This 
piece revels in masculinity, fo­
cusing on the special kinetic 
movements of the male dancers. 
However, there is no music — 
only the sounds of the dancers’ 
feet and breathing.
Closing the evening’s perfor­
mance is “Retablos”, choreo­
graphed by Carlos Orta, a com­
pany member since 1979. A na­
tive Venezuelan, Orta’s early 
dance training took place in West 
Germany at the Folkwang 
School in Essen. From there, he 
danced with the Folkwang 
Ballett, the Tanztheater 
Wuppertal, and the Cologne 
Tanz-Forum. He has also cho­
reographed works for the Neth­
erlands Dance Company, as well 
as for the Limón Dance Com­
pany. In August 1985, Orta re­
ceived The Prize of Dance, the 
highest artistic recognition 
honor for an artist to obtain from 
the Venezuelan government.
“Retablos,” Orta’s newest 
piece, was inspired by the lives 
of two of Spain’s most cel­
ebrated artists: Federico Garcia 
Lorca and Salvador Dali. Lorca 
met Dali while he was living in 
Madrid. Lorca was a poet, dra-

America's Most Wanted cloned ad nauseam on network TV
Limón Dance Company 
leaps into the Fulton
By MARY YEE ------------------------------------------
Tartan Staffwriter Dance Preview
A disturbing trend has made 
itself visible on network televi­
sion. One by one, marginally- 
performing comedies and dra­
mas leave the airwaves and are 
replaced with (shudder) “real­
ity” programs. Shows such as 
Unsolved Mysteries and Rescue: 
911, filled with dramatizations 
of events that might have really 
happened, are ho longer just re­
sults of cheap counter-program- 
ming. They have become bona 
fide hits.
This recent surge in popular­
ity is nothing to scoff at. Net­
work TV as we know it could be 
in serious trouble.
Look at the facts. America's 
Most Wanted has carved a loyal 
niche for itself. Rescue: 911 is 
very competitive against the 
ABC juggernaut, and Top Cops 
holds its own against the likes of 
Cosby and The Simpsons. Even 
£wo new entries from ABC, FBI: 
The Untold Stories and Ameri­
can Detective, have discovered 
an audience on Monday nights 
after languishing on Thursdays.
The king of the “reality” pro­
grams is Unsolved Mysteries. 
Hosted by the one e-Untouchable 
Robert Stack, this hour of mind- 
numbing fluff is a consistent top 
1*0 finisher, creaming quality 
comedies on CBS and ABC.
That’s the crux of the prob­
lem. Quality shows are losing 
out to stuff with writing and 
acting reminiscent of Divorce 
Court. Look at the shows that 
Unsolved Mysteries is beating: 
Brooklyn Bridge and The Won­
der Years — two of TV’s best; 
Dinosaurs, a premise with prom-
ABC promises to go directly 
against 60 Minutes with its own 
investigative hour, spelling 
doom for Life Goes On. And there 
are at least four 60 Minutes cor­
respondents who don’t have their 
own shows yet, leaving plenty of 
hit potential for CBS. And the 
competition is getting tighter.
That’s not all. John Walsh, 
host of America’s Most Wanted, 
recently hosted a Fox pilot that 
had all the looks of a spin-off, 
and a series of NBC specials 
called The Story Behind the Story 
has consistently beaten the com­
petition in its few appearances. 
“Reality” is taking over.
I know it may seem that I’m 
being stuck-up, defending my 
beloved entertainment pro­
grams while thumbing my nose 
at the disrespected “reality” 
genre. But that’s simply not true.
While I would never voluntar­
ily choose one of these programs 
over, say, a quality sitcom or 
drama, I believe that they have 
a right to exist and that people 
have a right to watch them, if 
they feel they must.
The problem is this: “reality” 
is cheap. If the networks can 
spend a little money for a big hit, 
they’re going to do it. After all, 
money is the goal. A “reality” 
show with mediocre ratings 
could conceivably bring the net­
work a bigger profit than an 
entertainment program with 
higher ratings.
Don’t you see? These programs 
are not just carving out a niche; 
they are taking over. Every 
week, a respectable program 
falls by the wayside for yet an-

THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
ise; and Davis Rules, a nice little 
sitcom that deserves a chance. 
Unfortunately, these shows will 
never be seen by the large por­
tion of the audience that tunes 
into Stack’s stories.
Other series are beginning to 
feel the heat as well. Yll Fly 
Away has already been forced to 
a new time slot by Captain Kirk’s 
911, and the CBS hit Evening 
Shade has watched its ratings 
slip against FBI: The Untold 
Stories. A couple of weeks ago, 
the unthinkable happened: a 
repeat of The Simpsons came in 
behind a Top Cops episode. Yes, 
this is serious stuff.
Even once-respectable news­
magazines have jumped on the 
“reality” bandwagon. ABC’s 20 / 
20 and PrimeTime Live are the 
most guilty. Didn’t get it on tape? 
Why not just reenact it? After 
all, it works for America’s Most 
Wanted and A Current Affair. 
Newsworthy now means sensa­
tional; these “newsmagazines” 
are becoming nothing more than 
a dramatic showcase.
While CBS’ entries are a bit 
more respectable, they seem to 
be part of a trend that is just as 
dangerous to the future of net­
work entertainment. Street Sto-
ries, a 48 Hours look-alike with 
60 Minutes correspondent Ed 
Bradley hosting, recently pre­
miered to good numbers in a 
tough Thursday slot. Hours 
(Wednesday at 10 pm on KDKA- 
2) and Stories are less news­
magazines than chronicles of 
peoples’ lives. Bradley and Dan 
Rather spend time each week 
focusing on a particular aspect 
of human existence.
These are not necessarily bad, 
or even unentertaining, pro­
grams. The problem is that as 
they proliferate, entertainment 
programs lose out. The Trials of 
Rosie O’Neill is the drama Street 
Stories replaced. 48 Hours con­
sistently wins its time period 
over Quantum Leap and Civil 
Wars.
No matter how news-minded 
and serious these shows appear 
to be, it is a fact that they owe 
their existence, and their popu­
larity, to the “reality” genre.
Chronicling the adventures of 
real people with voice-over nar­
ration is only a step away frpm 
Cops, which chronicles the ad­
ventures of police officers with 
almost no voice-over narration. 
Cops, in turn, is only a step away 
from America’s Most Wanted, 
whose popular reenactments 
made Cops possible.
A hefty percentage of the net­
work schedules has been handed 
over to “reality” programs and 
their offspring, and the percent­
age keeps on growing. In a few 
weeks, NBC premieres a Jane 
Pauley-Stone Phillips news­
magazine at the expense of Rea­
sonable Doubts. Later this year,
Get going, call 1'800-967AMEX.
other hour of “real” reenact­
ments.
The consequences of this take­
over are scary. Think about it: a 
few years down the road, you 
may find yourself wondering 
whatever happened to the 
Cheers gang or Murphy Brown 
as you scan the channels, each 
boasting real re-creations of past 
dramatizations of a story some­
one once told that just might be
true, hosted by your favorite 
aging, out-of-work actor. You 
may even find yourself yearn­
ing for the likes of Major Dad. 
Quality will have a whole new 
meaning.

2nd Animation Celebration
.. Sometimes you just need a little break from all 
the dramatic cinematography bombarding our 
theaters today. 2nd Animation Celebration is the 
perfect antidote. The film is filled with colorful and 
exciting cartoons that may someday be compared 
with the likes of Bugs Bunny and the Roadrunner.
Several highlights of the film include Simpsons 
cartoons that existed before the TV series (does 
that include The Tracey Ullman Show too? Hmm....) 
Other interesting cartoons include “25 Ways to 
Quit Smoking” by Bill Plympton, whose cartoons 
are now frequently seen on MTV, and beautiful 
computer graphics like “Tin Toy” and “Knick- 
knack” by Pixar Studio.
For a night of the unusal, the colorful, and the 
familiar, come down to DH 2210 and see what may 
fee the cartoon favorites of the future.

Billy Bathgate
Mobsters, shootings, and jury indictments seem 
to have always been something the American film 
public has enjoyed, so why not bring a little bit 
more of this “on-screen magic” to DH 2210?
Billy Bathgate is an exciting movie starring 
Dtistin Hoffman as a powerful gangster. A young 
boy from the poor side of town expresses interest 
in Hoffman’s “business” and Hoffman takes him 
under his wing. As Hoffman’s character and the 
boy become closer, controversy arises — both men 
fall in love with the same woman (Nicole 
Kidman).Will the gangster kill the boy in an all 
American shoot-out? Will he forgive him? Or will 
he simply eliminate the woman?

Doc Hollywood
Sure you can see the ending to this movie a mile 
away, but it doesn’t diminish any of the fun. Doc 
Hollywood tells the tale of Dr. Benjamin Stone 
(Michael J. Fox), a young surgeon with dollar signs 
«1 his eyes. However, en route to Beverly Hills, he 
crashes his car in the middle of nowhere, South 
Carolina. And, of course, the local residents are in 
dire need of an M.D.
The rest of the film deals with Fox falling in love 
with the pretty local girl (Julie Warner), becoming 
accustomed to the local strangeness, and the even­
tual conflict between staying or going to Califor­
nia. Guess which wins out?

Witness
Witness, takes the “fish-out-of-water” theme and 
turns it into a first rate suspense movie. With an 
exciting plot and unusual characters, the movie is 
first-rate.
While on a trip with his widowed mother (Kelly 
McGillis), a young Amish boy (Lukas Haas) wit­
nesses a murder in a Philadelphia train station. 
The detective in charge of the case (Harrison Ford) 
learns that the murderer is a police officer and 
realizes that the boy’s life is in danger. After Ford 
gets shot, he takes the boy and his mother back 
home where they can hide. While he’s healing from 
his wound, Ford stays with the family. Eventually, 
the corrupt police find the family. The final show­
down is one that will keep audiences on the edge of 
their seats.
Director Peter Weir manages to tie together 
many ideas. On one level, the suspense and action 
works very well. The plot, unlike many action 
movies, has few holes in it. Weir also presents a 
relatively realistic portrayal of Amish life. With a 
nice cross-cultural romance thrown in, Witness 
offers a lot in one movie. And it’s well worth a 
dollar and a few hours.

Young man’s secrets are revealed in S9.gkM1 S9.gkM
By AARON JENKINS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The killing of six million Jews 
in the Holocaust is a tragedy 
that is sometimes hard to dis­
cuss. For those who survived or 
escaped the concentration 
camps, haunting memories will 
remain. Director and screenplay 
writer Agnieszka Holland deli­
cately approach the subject by 
exploring the life of a young J e w- 
ish boy who escaped Nazi perse­
cution in the film Europa, 
Europa. The plot’s underlying 
conflict, the small sprinklings of 
humor which prevent the sub­
ject from being extremely dark, 
and the effective performances 
of the actors make the film a 
touching and educational expe­
rience.
Europa, Europa is the true 
story of a Jewish boy, Solomon 
Perel (Marco Hofschneider) 
whose parents move out of Ger­
many to Poland to avoid perse­
cution prior to World War II. 
Solomon and his older brother, 
Isaac, are sent east when the 
war begins. Solomon (nick­
named Solly) is captured by 
Russian troops and sent to an 
orphanage in Russia, but Isaac 
disappears, and is presumed 
dead. Solly stays in the orphan­
age for two years where he sar­
castically describes himself as 
becoming a “true Communist.” 
Later, when Hitler invades Rus­
sia, Solly is captured, and pre­
sents himself as a German 
named Josef Peters. He is re­
cruited into the army, and 
through a strange turn of events, 
becomes a German war hero. 
Thus, Solly, the Jew-turned- 
Communist, becomes Solly the 
Communist-turned-Nazi.
Unfortunately for Solly, he 
must pretend to be German 
twenty-four hours a day. This 
shouldn’t be a problem since he 
speaks German fluently, but 
there, is one slight hitch. Solly 
must be careful in his bathing 
and excreting habits — his cir­
cumcision will give him away as 
a Jew instantly. In an incredible 
twist of fate, Solly is sent to the 
most prestigious Nazi youth 
school in Germany. There he 
must be even more careful of

hiding his genitals, for he is un­
der close scrutiny constantly, liv­
ing in a dormitory situation. It is 
here he meets Leni (Julie D elpy), 
who ends up becoming his girl­
friend. He can’t allow himself to 
have sex with her, of course, so 
she later finds herself a more 
willing lover.
After his schooling, Solly finds 
himself fighting the Russians in 
a battle. He deserts and is cap­
tured by the Russians, who take 
him to a liberated concentration 
camp. It is here where Solly’s 
fate will finally be decided.
Despite the way the plot un­
folds on paper, it is actually 
quite believable. The whole 
movie is full of tension, and is 
very powerful emotionally. In 
one scene, Solly-the-Nazi visits 
Lodz, where there is a Jewish 
ghetto in which he believes his 
parents live.
The ghetto is off limits to ev­
eryone (Nazi youths included), 
so Solly’s only chance of seeing 
the area is by riding a trolley 
through it to the other side of 
town. Unfortunately for him, the 
windows of the trolley are 
painted over, so he has to squint 
through a small area that he 
scrapes clear. What he sees is a 
very graphic view of a tortured 
society. Dead bodies litter the 
street, an insane woman waves 
a bundle in the air, and old people 
sit and stare mutely at the trol­
ley as it passes, their eyes huge 
in comparison to their gaunt 
faces. Solly tries to open a win­
dow at one point, and is immedi­
ately challenged by one of the 
passengers. “I’m just trying to 
get some fresh air,” he stam­
mers. “Fresh air?” one man re­
marks, “In the ghetto?” Immedi­
ately, all of the passengers be­
gin to laugh, and Solly turns 
away from them, sickened.
The big conflict of the movie is

“Retablos” centers on the cre­
ativity of these two brilliant 
minds and the love between two 
friends that moved Dali to write 
in Diary of a Genius:
“One thing is certain. Each 
time... a brilliant idea is formed 
in my brain, or I succeed in mak­
ing a brush stroke that is 
archangelically miraculous, I 
always hear the raucous, slightly 
muffled voice of Lorca ...” 
Sparked by philosophical dif­
ferences, their conflicts did not

take a stand about Solly's betrayal 
of his religion. In fact, the movie 
makes no judgments whatsoever; 
even about the Nazi treatment of 
Jews in the concentration camps.
heritage from those who sur­
round him. In his early days in 
the German army, a soldier 
named Robert Kellerm an (Andre 
Wilms) tries to molest him, but 
sees his circumcised penis. 
Thereafter, he and Solly become 
close, “like brothers” as 
Kellerm an puts it. Solly is happy, 
because he finally has someone 
who knows his secret and will 
not betray him, and Kellerman 
is happy because... well, for 
whatever reason that makes 
child molesters who don’t mo­
lest children happy. Kellerman 
is killed later, and Solly must 
now keep his secret to himself. 
Eventually he confides in Leni’s 
mother, after Leni tells him that 
if she ever met a Jew, she would 
kill him. “Why?” Solly asks. “Be­
cause he’s a Jew,” she quickly 
answers. Solly also encounters 
a police official who demands to 
see his “Certification of Germ an 
Purity,” something which he 
cannot possibly have. Luck in­
tervenes for him on this count, 
too.
There is humor in the movie 
also, despite its subject mate­
rial. When he is sent off to the 
Hitler Youth school, Solly is se­
duced by a woman, a represen­
tative of the school. She com­
ments on how his birthday is on 
the same day as Hitler’s, then 
compares his hair and his eyes 
to Hitler’s. Later, when they 
have sex, she screams “The 
Führer!” when she orgasms.
For those with a more maca­
bre sense of humor, there is the 
scene where Solly ties a string 
around his penis, in order to 
alter the appearance of his fore­
skin, and ties it tight. The re­
sults, as we are shown, are not 
pleasant.
Interestingly, the movie does
not take a stand about Solly^s 
betrayal of his religion. In fact, 
the movie makes no judgments 
whatsoever, even about the Nazi 
treatment of Jews in the concen­
tration camps. The whole film iS 
straightforward and factual. ,
The acting is first rate. Every 
actor is practically perfect even 
though portraying characters 
who were born about 35 years 
before them. There is never a 
look out of place, or an unbelief 
able line — everything is firsfj 
rate.
The story is superb, too. As a 
movie, it is impressive enough, 
but knowing that it is a true 
story only adds to the excite­
ment. You know that Solly sur­
vives (since the story is being 
told by the real Solomon Perel), 
but that certainly doesn’t help, 
you to believe that he can really 
get out of the seemingly impos­
sible dilemmas that he faces, 
during the course of the film.
The only real flaw of the film ig 
related to its marketing and bill£ 
ing. The movie poster is a big 
picture of Solly’s head, with a 
smaller shot of Leni in the back­
ground. Leni also receives ma­
jor billing in the film. Simply 
put, she wasn’t that important 
as a character. In all fairness, 
the child molester (Kellerman) 
should have had his picture be? 
hind Solly. Leni was a brilliant 
portrayal of a teenage girl who, 
had been indoctrinated by the- 
Nazis, and the part was played 
superbly, but as a character, she 
just wasn’t that important! ;r
With its storyline, acting, and, 
proper handling of a despairing., 
situation, Europa, Europa can* 
be named as a wonderful film,
