CMU in Haiti forges bonds over spring break
GEORGE LEDERMAN
Junior Staffwriter
While many Carnegie Mel-
lon students traveled to the 
Caribbean over spring break 
in search of beaches, con-
certs, and frozen margaritas, 
10 Carnegie Mellon students 
made their ?rst trip to Haiti 
with a more service-oriented 
goal.
CMU in Haiti, the nascent 
student organization that 
sponsored the trip, raised 
$6,000 for various charities 
in Haiti — one of the world’s 
poorest countries — which 
they distributed during their 
visit. They supported Society 
of Providence United for the 
Economic Development of 
Pétion-Villois (SOPUDEP), a 
Haitian grassroots organiza-
tion which runs a school, a 
micro?nance program called 
Fam SOPUDEP an Aksyon 
(FASA), and a group to em-
power women called Mouve-
ments des Jeunes Unis pour 
le Développement des Bobin, 
Pétion-Villois (MOJUB).
This trip is CMU in Haiti’s 
?rst to the country; co-found-
ers electrical and computer 
engineering and business ad-
ministration double major Ian 
Glasner and professional writ-
ing major Laura Scherb found-
ed the organization in 2013 as 
an effort to not only take an 
annual spring break trip, but 
also to establish and maintain 
a relationship with their coun-
terparts in Haiti. Glasner was 
inspired by his high school 
experience at Los Altos High 
School in Los Altos, Calif., 
where he was a member of 
the outreach and philanthro-
py organization Solidarity in 
Haiti. Los Altos High School 
recently became an of?cial 
sister school of SOPUDEP af-
ter Solidarity in Haiti’s annual 
trips to Haiti connected the 
two schools.
Glasner hopes that CMU 
in Haiti will stand out among 
the myriad of other student 
organizations that take spring 
break trips to impoverished 
countries or domestic places 
in need, including Global 
Medical Brigades (GMB) and 
Global Public Health Brigades 
(GPHB), which both trav-
eled to Honduras this year; 
Orphanage Outreach, which 
traveled to the Dominican 
Republic; and Habitat for Hu-
manity, which traveled to Ma-
con, Ga.
All of these organizations 
do service work, from pro-
viding medication and public 
health infrastructure in the 
case of GMB and GPHB, re-
spectively, to building homes 
for those in need, like Habitat 
for Humanity, or volunteering 
at orphanages like Orphanage 
Outreach. 
CMU in Haiti also focuses 
on service, with additional 
goals that involve forming re-
lationships with the Haitian 
people the students interact 
with and nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) like 
SOPUDEP.

CMU’s Doha, Qatar campus turns ten
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
News Editor
In 2004, Carnegie Mellon 
opened a branch in Educa-
tion City, a region of educa-
tional facilities on the out-
skirts of Doha, the capital of 
Qatar. Last Tuesday, the uni-
versity celebrated the tenth 
anniversary of the CMU Qa-
tar campus with an hour-long 
ceremony featuring key lead-
ership from both campuses, 
as well as alumni, faculty, 
students, and distinguished 
international guests.
When Carnegie Mellon 
opened its Education City 
campus in 2004, it began by 
teaching only 41 students 
in two academic programs. 
Now it offers ?ve programs, 
including biological sci-
ences, business administra-
tion, computational biol-
ogy, computer science, and 
information systems to over 
400 students.
CMU Qatar has gradu-
ated over 300 students in its 
decade of education, all of 
whom have enrolled in top 
graduate programs or been 
sought out by the world’s 
leading companies.
Mark Kamlet, provost and 
executive vice president of 
Carnegie Mellon, spoke on 
behalf of Ilker Baybars, the 
dean of the CMU Qatar cam-
pus, at the ceremony in Doha 
on Tuesday.
“I will say — and the stu-
dents know — that the Carn-
egie Mellon curriculum in 
Qatar is every bit as rigorous, 
as challenging, as thorough, 
and as demanding as in Pitts-
burgh. I also want to say that 
the students here have done 
extraordinarily well. And I 
mean not only academically 
but as ethical, bright, hard-
working, and humane lead-
ers,” Kamlet said. “Indeed we 
are here helping to create the 
next generation of leaders, 
entrepreneurs, thinkers, and 
problem solvers.”
CMU Qatar has received 
much recognition from the 
international community. 
One measure of this recog-
nition, a university press 
release notes, is the many 
high-pro?le visitors that the 
university’s campus in Qa-
tar has hosted, including Bill 
Gates, Hillary Clinton, and 
former U.S. Secretary of En-
ergy Steven Chu.
University president Sub-
ra Suresh said that the suc-
cess of CMU’s Qatar campus 
is a hallmark of Carnegie 
Mellon’s leadership in the 
?eld of higher education.
“Higher education and 
governments are awakening 
the need for greater educa-
tional opportunity, and many 
are taking action. But I can 
think of no other nation that 
has responded as vigorously 
and imaginatively as has Qa-
tar,” Suresh said in a univer-
sity press release. “The story 
of Education City has been a 
powerful example for the en-
tire world, and the world has 
taken notice of this success.”
The tenth anniversary 
celebration comes on the 
heels of the annual Initiating 
Meaningful Pittsburgh and 
Qatar Ties (IMPAQT) pro-
gram, which sends Carnegie 
Mellon students from Pitts-
burgh to Qatar every Spring 
Break.
IMPAQT, according to its 
website, began in 2008 as 
part of a ?fth-year scholar ini-
tiative. The program is meant 
“to develop strategies and

AB announces Spring Carnival artists
LILAH BUCHANAN
Staffwriter
After much anticipation, 
AB Concerts announced on 
Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. this 
year’s Spring Carnival con-
cert performers: Icona Pop 
and Mac Miller. Icona Pop is 
a Swedish DJ duo with an em-
phasis on electro house and 
indie pop. The duo gained 
attention in the United States 
for their song “I Love It” in 
2012. Mac Miller, a rapper 
and Pittsburgh native, is most 
popular for his song “Party on 
Fifth Ave.”
Icona Pop and Mac Miller 
come on the heels of Lupe Fi-
asco, who performed at last 
year’s Spring Carnival, and 
Passion Pit, who performed at 
the 2012 Spring Carnival.
AB Concerts co-chairs ju-
nior computer science major 
Rebecca Paren and senior 
human-computer interaction 
and business administration 
double major Ronny Ho ex-
plained their selection, saying 
that because it’s so dif?cult to 
please the campus as whole, 
they liked the idea of selecting 
two distinct artists to appeal 
to a wider audience.
The selection process 
started with a collective brain-
storming session, Ho said. 
“Literally on a chalk board — 
everyone just name-drops art-
ists and bands,” Ho described.
From there, it came down 
to questions of scheduling, 
cost, and campus appeal. Ho 
and Paren noted that it can 
be dif?cult to get top artists 
for Spring Carnival, because 
it usually coincides with the 
Coachella Valley Music and 
Arts Festival in California. The 
members of AB Concerts also 
usually avoid country music, 
because they doubt that it will 
appeal to a large segment of 
the student body. 
Beyond that, Paren and Ho 
said, the co-chairs are open to 
anything, although the uni-
versity prefers that they stay 
away from artists that encour-
age marijuana use.
Paren and Ho are excited 
for Mac Miller; they both liked 
the idea of featuring an art-
ist from the Pittsburgh area 
for the 100th Spring Car-
nival. They are also excited 
to host an up-and-coming 
foreign group like Icona Pop.
The student body’s reac-
tion is mixed. Icona Pop has 
generally garnered more ex-
citement than Mac Miller. 
First-year mechanical engi-
neering and engineering and 
public policy double major TJ 
Murray explained, “I am excit-
ed for Icona Pop because they 
take me back to the glory days 
— and nights — summer.”
Saumya Dalal, a junior 
computer science major, said 
that this year’s artists are a 
marked improvement over 
previous years. “I think it’s a 
“I am excited for Icona Pop 
because they take me back to the 
glory days — and nights — of 
summer.”

U.S. News and World Re-
port recently released its 2014 
undergraduate and graduate 
college rankings. Carnegie 
Mellon was ranked the num-
ber one graduate school for 
computer science in the Unit-
ed States, retaining the spot it 
earned in 2010, the last time 
U.S. News and World Report 
ranked graduate schools in 
computer science.
Carnegie Mellon was tied 
for the top spot with the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, Stanford University, 
and the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley. In specialty 
computer science rankings, 
Carnegie Mellon was ranked 
number one in programming 
languages, second in arti?-
cial intelligence, fourth in 
systems, and ?fth in theory.
Carnegie Mellon also 
earned several other top 20 
spots in the U.S. News and 
World Report graduate rank-
ings, including ?fth in engi-
neering, ninth in statistics, 
10th in part-time MBA and 
18th in full-time MBA.
For engineering, speci?-
cally, Carnegie Mellon was 
ranked fourth in computer 
engineering, seventh in en-
vironmental engineering, 
eighth in electrical engineer-
ing, and 10th in mechanical 
engineering.
On the overall list of na-
tional university rankings, 
Carnegie Mellon retained its 
ranking of 23rd.

CMU research analyzes asthma patients
Wei Wu, an associate pro-
fessor in Carnegie Mellon’s 
Lane Center for Computa-
tional Biology, recently con-
ducted research published 
in the Journal of Allergy and 
Clinical Immunology. Wu led 
the analysis of data obtained 
from the Severe Asthma Re-
search Program, using com-
putational biology methods 
to identify groupings of 
patients.
Wu’s methods were based 
on machine learning algo-
rithms, which ?nd patterns 
in data and learn from what 
they ?nd to improve their 
performance from experi-
ence. Wu’s analysis was 
based on 112 asthma-related 
variables, measuring every-
thing from lung function to 
family history. The clusters 
Wu identi?ed, in many cases, 
aligned with known group-
ing, such as asthma related 
to allergies, sinus disease, or 
environmental factors. Wu 
also identi?ed new clusters, 
however, such as one char-
acterized by frequent, severe 
asthma symptoms associated 
with poor quality of life and 
depression in some obese 
women.
“The ultimate goal is to 
develop treatments that 
are based on the biologi-
cal mechanisms underly-
ing each cluster of patients, 
rather than simply treating 
the symptoms,” said Wu in 
a university news release. 
To accomplish this goal, Wu 
and her collaborators are 
analyzing genetic factors as-
sociated with each of the pa-
tient clusters.
Dr. Sally E. Wenzel, di-
rector of the University of 
Pittsburgh Asthma Institute 
at the University of Pitts-
burgh Medical Center and 
the University of Pittsburgh 
School of Medicine, as well 
as lead co-author of the re-
cently published paper, said 
that this research could 
have implications beyond 
just asthma. “This approach 
has implications not just for 
asthma, but for all complex 
diseases, which include most 
chronic diseases,” Wenzel 
said in the news release.
While many asthmatics 
respond well to corticoste-
roids, Wu’s research could 
help create more speci?c, ge-
netically-targeted treatment 
plans for those who don’t. 
The research was sponsored 
by the National Institute of 
General Medical Sciences 
and the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute 
of the National Institutes of 
Health.

CMU in Haiti builds long-term connections on spring break trip
and the Haitian organizations 
they worked with this past 
spring break. CMU in Haiti, 
Glasner said, is distinguished 
not by the service they do — 
although it is an important 
part of their initiative — but 
by the connections they are 
making with Haitian organi-
zations and Haitian citizens.
“It was an incredible trip,” 
said Connie Yang, a ?rst-year 
mathematical sciences ma-
jor. “I went in knowing only 
some facts from the newspa-
pers, like the level of poverty 
[in Haiti]. But there I learned 
about the people — they were 
so nice and genuine.”
Glasner said that their 
work is as much about help-
ing Haitians as it is about 
teaching students at Carn-
egie Mellon. “Its about creat-
ing lifelong philanthropists 
— people who will be more 
knowledgeable,” said Glasner, 
who is also currently student 
body vice president. Glasner 
has himself shown long-term 
dedication to Haiti; he has 
now traveled on three similar 
charitable trips to the nation.
CMU in Haiti emerged 
from “The Uses and Abuses 
of Haiti,” a seminar taught 
by Michael West, a professor 
in the department of mod-
ern languages at Carnegie 
Mellon. 
Glasner raised money for 
Haiti in high school with the 
Haiti Solidarity Club and 
spoke in the seminar about his 
experiences. 
Together with Scherb, he 
launched the club to address 
the urgent needs about which 
they had learned.
The club has three main 
purposes: ?rst, to raise money 
before the trip; this fund-
raising directly bene?ts the 
schools and organizations in 
Haiti; second, for the students 
to learn about Haitian culture 
and ways of life during the 
trip and forge connections 
with the Haitian people; and 
third, for the students to raise 
awareness about Haiti after 
the trip.
According to Yang, many 
of the NGOs working in Haiti 
suffer from the same types 
of corruption which have ef-
fectively crippled the Haitian 
government. To avoid this 
corruption, CMU in Haiti 
partnered with Rea Dol, a 
woman who has received in-
ternational recognition for 
her grassroots efforts within 
Haiti. 
Dol founded SOPUDEP in 
the 1990s to help some of Hai-
ti’s most impoverished resi-
dents through a number of 
ancillary organizations such 
as the SOPUDEP school and 
FASA; the need for her pro-
grams has intensi?ed since a 
2010 earthquake devastated 
much of Haiti.
The students visited a refu-
gee camp that continues to 
house Haitians affected by the 
earthquake. 
“The leader of the refugee 
camp gave an impassioned 
speech ‘that the people of 
Haiti do not want to be giv-
en ?sh. They want to learn 
to ?sh.’ Their spirit, given 
those bad conditions ... is 
really amazing,” said Yang.

OUTREACH, from A1
CMU Qatar celebrates its 10th anniversary in Doha
initiatives to best leverage the 
relationship between the two 
campuses toward enhancing 
student life and the student 
experience on both.”
Gail Wilson, a sophomore 
computer science major who 
recently returned from IM-
PAQT, said that CMU Qatar is 
an important way to expand 
Carnegie Mellon’s interna-
tional name. “Carnegie Mel-
lon is getting on a much more 
international level, which is 
really, really cool. But also 
they’re starting anew there, in 
a way,” Wilson said.
“The dynamic between the 
two campuses is really inter-
esting — they’re still Carnegie 
Mellon students, they’re still 
just as passionate, all that 
stuff,” Wilson continued. “But 
the campus is so small they’re 
also like a huge family there. 
Especially for us visiting, ev-
eryone knew us, everyone 
was saying hi to us, introduc-
ing us to friends. It was really, 
really cool.”
Students who par-
ticipated in IMPAQT each 
came up with a project to 
bridge the two campuses.  
Wilson planned to have stu-
dents from both campuses 
answer questions to see the 
differences and similarities 
between the cultures of the 
two branches.
Wilson, however, said that 
her project evolved along 
with the rest of the group’s. 
“When we got there we de-
cided, though — although a 
lot of us are keeping the same 
projects — but a lot of us are 
focusing on getting people at 
Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh to 
know more about the Qatar 
campus.”

Mac Miller and Icona Pop to perform at Spring Carnival
good choice,” she said. “It’s 
de?nitely better than last 
year’s concert, or the year 
before.”
Sentiments about Mac 
Miller seem more negative 
than sentiments about Icona 
Pop. 
“The ?rst thing I thought 
when I found out Mac Miller 
[was coming] was ‘LOL,’ and 
then how he seems like the 
kind of artist that wouldn’t 
want to perform at CMU,” 
said ?rst-year ?ne arts major 
Joni Sullivan.
The co-chairs explained 
that the AB Concerts board 
always expects mixed feelings 
about their decisions.
“We want the student 
body to understand we aren’t 
choosing people we love.” 
Paren said, “Our musical in-
terests do not in?uence who 
we pick. We want to do what’s 
best for the campus with the 
money and timing we have.”
The concert will take place 
on Friday, April 11 at 8 p.m. 
on the Mall or, if there are bad 
weather conditions, in Wie-
gand Gymnasium. 
The concert on the Mall 
will be open to the public. 
Students will not be required 
to get tickets unless the con-
cert is moved indoors, where 
space is limited.

The second installment of 
“The First Lectures” was held 
on Thursday, March 20 at 8 
p.m. The idea for the lecture 
series came from Vaasavi Un-
nava, a ?rst-year economics 
and statistics double major. 
The title “First Lectures” al-
ludes to former computer sci-
ence and human-computer 
interaction and design pro-
fessor Randy Pausch’s The 
Last Lecture, which he gave in 
McConomy Auditorium after 
being diagnosed with termi-
nal pancreatic cancer in 2006.
In a previous interview, 
Unnava said she was particu-
larly struck by the line, “It’s 
not about how to achieve your 
dreams, it’s about how to lead 
your life.”
In his last lecture — and 
in the book it inspired which 
Pausch co-authored — Pausch 
discussed his journey through 
life and the notion of “achiev-
ing your childhood dreams.” 
According to the Facebook 
event page for “The First Lec-
tures,” “Each lecture is indi-
vidualized and meant to tell 
the story of a senior, through 
good and bad, and is a re?ec-
tion on the past four years at 
Carnegie Mellon, and how his 
or her school and peers have 
impacted them.”
The two speakers at last 
Thursday’s event were senior 
acting major Thomas Con-
stantine Moore and senior 
business administration ma-
jor Stephen Serrao.
Moore discussed the im-
portance of focus while at 
Carnegie Mellon. He spoke 
about how dif?cult it can be 
that so many actors are com-
peting for a limited amount 
of roles. According to the U.S. 
Department of Education, 
over 90,000 bachelor’s de-
grees in visual and perform-
ing arts were awarded in 2011 
alone.
Moore noted, however, 
how the university provides 
its students with many op-
portunities. “CMU sets people 
up,” Moore said. “CMU gives 
its students a competitive 
edge like none other. Students 
arrive with a passion and 
leave with understanding, 
skill, and connections.”
At times, Moore said, the 
workload made him feel like 
he was drowning. “Most of the 
time,” he said, “drowning us 
is this school’s way of teach-
ing us how to swim.” Speci?-
cally, Moore talked about his 
experience in 15-112: Funda-
mentals of Programming and 
Computer Science. 
Moore said that although 
it was the class at Carnegie 
Mellon he had to work hard-
est in, he enjoyed it so much 
that he became a teaching as-
sistant for it.
Moore soon found that 
he couldn’t continue being a 
TA when he began his junior 
year. “Junior year, you’re in 
four shows, which means you 
can expect to be in rehearsal 
or performance six days a 
week, 12 weeks out of each 
semester,” Moore said. “One 
of the traits I think CMU 
people share, in general, is an 
absolute abhorrence for ad-
mitting defeat. But a big part 
of learning to focus is learning 
how to recognize when some-
thing is happening in your life 
that you really can’t afford.”
Moore maintained, how-
ever, that he had no regrets. 
“I’m still glad I did it. I’m glad 
I tried it. Even though I was 
drowning, it was the sort of 
drowning that builds charac-
ter, I think.”
Moore thinks that the best 
way to ?nd success at Carn-
egie Mellon is to focus on one 
area you excel in, having a 
sense of incredible focus, and 
through the encouragement 
of adventurism. 
He also talked about some 
of the diverse and exciting 
events he has been involved 
with as a senior. “This year 
I’ve also choreographed a 
dance piece for the ?rst time, 
written and performed my 
own one-man show for Play-
ground, successfully mounted 
an ongoing web comic, and 
begun to professionally de-
sign websites for actors in my 
program.”
Serrao, a senior business 
administration major, ques-
tioned the de?nition of learn-
ing. He proposed a new de?-
nition: signi?cant learning. 
Signi?cant learning, Serrao 
said, calls for learning both 
inside and outside the class-
room while creating a web of 
insight.
Serrao had three lessons 
for students at the school, 
urging them to “strive for 
excellence, put people ?rst 
in everything you do, and to 
embrace vulnerability.” Ac-
cording to Serrao, following 
these three guidelines is the 
key to success. “Once you get 
these three points, you’d be 
on your own path to learn-
ing,” he said.
Regarding his ?rst point, 
Serrao said that it was im-
portant to maintain excellent 
company: “whether you’re in 
or out, and whether you’re 
surrounded by the right 
people.”
Speaking to his second 
point, Serrao admitted that 
“initially I thought of my suc-
cess before everyone else, but 
it just didn’t work. I made it a 
prerogative to surround my-
self with excellent and suc-
cessful people.” 
According to Serrao, it’s 
important to start realizing 
success is not just about an 
individual, but also includes 
the people surrounding that 
individual.
Serrao also thought it was 
important to embrace vul-
nerability. “Being vulnerable 
is being alive, and is when 
you’re allowed to grow the 
most,” Serrao said. “To be 
able to grow as a person, you 
need to embrace risk and face 
its values. It’s important to be 
aware, because it helps you 
grow.”

First-year chemical engi-
neering and engineering and 
public policy double major 
Trevor Hadick is running for 
student body vice president 
for organizations (SBVPO) 
on a platform of improving 
communication between or-
ganizations and the Commit-
tee on Student Organizations 
(CoSO), as well as increasing 
collaborations between orga-
nizations and making space 
allocations more ef?cient. 
Hadick also hopes to reform 
the current student govern-
ment elections process by 
having two election periods: 
one in the spring to elect the 
SBVPO, and then another in 
the fall to elect members of 
the Committee on Student 
Organizations.
“This position has been 
underutilized and underde-
veloped; however, I plan on 
going above and beyond the 
de?ned duties of the posi-
tion,” Hadick wrote in an 
email. 
“I want organizations to 
see me as a resource, even 
beyond recognition/re-recog-
nition and space allocations. 
My goal is to be their ally by 
helping connect them to the 
important resources here on 
campus, assisting organiza-
tion’s transition to new lead-
ers, and advocating for their 
thoughts and opinions.”
According to his platform, 
Hadick plans to increase com-
munication throughout the 
various organizations and 
branches of student govern-
ment, but he also wants to 
ensure the retention of insti-
tutional knowledge. 
Though he is new to stu-
dent government as a ?rst-
year student, he has spoken 
extensively with more senior 
members to better under-
stand the process. Hadick 
feels that his relative inexpe-
rience could prove to be an 
asset. “I hope to bring a new 
perspective and fresh twist to 
the current procedures of the 
student body government.... 
I know that along the way 
there are going to be times 
when tough decisions need 
to be made, even if they are 
going to upset students. How-
ever, I must do what is in the 
best interest of the student 
body and organizations as a 
whole,” Hadick wrote.
Hadick is vice president of 
the First-Year Advisory Board 
for the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology (CIT). The board 
acts as the voice of ?rst-year 
students in CIT and communi-
cates with the administration, 
staff, and faculty. 
He is also a member of the 
men’s club soccer team and a 
member of Engineers Without 
Borders (EWB). Next year, he 
will be a member of the In-
ternational Project Planning 
Committee of EWB, as well as 
an RA in Mudge House.

Sophomore computer sci-
ence and math double major 
Jackson Michalak is run-
ning for student body vice 
president for organizations 
(SBVPO) on a platform of re-
forming the room registration 
system and mature organiza-
tions re-recognition system, 
as well as giving organiza-
tions more help and support 
in recruiting. 
Michalak said that the 
position of SBVPO involves 
representing students, but 
that the point of the position 
is to represent organizations 
themselves. He said that these 
roles overlap.
Michalak said he would 
reform the room reservation 
system, which student orga-
nizations use to reserve space 
for meetings and various ac-
tivities. “I think it’s horrible to 
deal with,” Michalak said.
Michalak also wants to 
streamline the system of cre-
ating new organizations on 
campus. “I think there needs 
to be a clearer set of expecta-
tions for what is required for 
a new organization,” Micha-
lak said. “For CoSO, I’ve been 
acting as the chair of new rec-
ognition, so I’m responsible 
for interacting with the new 
prospective organizations, to 
a large extent, to make sure 
their constitution is up to ex-
pectation and makes sense, 
and make sure that the struc-
ture that they’re trying to 
build will be stable.”
Part of the problem, Mi-
chalak said, is that there is 
no clear list of what the ex-
pectations of a new organi-
zation are. “If you go to the 
university’s website now, you 
go to the CoSO page — some 
of the information is out of 
date; it’s sort of ambiguous as 
to what the expectations are 
for a new organization. I do 
meet with an organization to 
help them with their consti-
tution, [but] there are many 
things missing. There’s ideas 
that they didn’t realize were 
required, or weren’t required, 
and there’s all these sets of as-
sumptions that don’t match 
up. So I think it would be nice 
to have one place where all of 
that would be clear.”
Another important area 
that some student organiza-
tions need help with is re-
cruitment and general advice, 
according to Michalak. CoSO 
reaches out to support strug-
gling organizations, and sim-
ply lacking membership is a 
very common problem. More 
generally, sometimes organi-
zations need advice on how 
to improve day-to-day opera-
tions or special problems. “I 
think it would be good to have 
a better outlet for advice on 
these things with an organi-
zation,” Michalak said. “It’s a 
de?nite problem that should 
be addressed, and can be ad-
dressed reasonably.”
Michalak is a member of 
the Plaid Parliament of Pwn-
ing (PPP), Carnegie Mellon’s 
computer security club. He is 
also the chair of new recogni-
tion of the Committee on Stu-
dent Organizations, as well 
as a regular observer of the 
University Center Allocation 
Board (UCAB). Michalak be-
gan attending meetings when 
he decided to run for SBVPO.

Junior chemistry major 
Dominic Akerele is running 
for student body president 
(SBP) with junior electrical 
and computer engineering 
major Rohan Saigal as student 
body vice president (SBVP) 
on a platform of increasing 
student engagement, making 
the printing system on cam-
pus more effective, creating a 
campus homepage speci?cal-
ly for students, and improving 
students’ general health.
Akerele and Saigal want to 
generally improve student life 
at Carnegie Mellon. “This is a 
prestigious university — aca-
demically very stressful — so 
I think it’s the job of the stu-
dent body [vice president] to 
distract everyone from that 
life, so you can get out of here 
with a good degree, a good 
job, and on track for your life, 
but at the same time make 
this the best four years pos-
sible, not just during the four 
days of Spring Carnival,” Sai-
gal said.
Akerele said that a ma-
jor goal of his and Saigal’s 
campaign is to revamp Carn-
egie Mellon school spirit. “We 
would like to build in [a spirit-
raising week], especially into 
the fall, because primarily I 
feel students only have one 
major thing that they look 
forward to, which is Spring 
Carnival, but I feel the fall is 
kind of lacking something,” 
Akerele said. “We’d have a 
week designated where we’d 
amp up students, have activi-
ties going on, free food. And it 
all culminates in one ?nal day, 
maybe the Friday leading up 
to midsemester break, where 
the students have a day off, 
where we all get together as 
a campus. I’d like to have Dr. 
Suresh give a speech, as well. 
I would also like to build the 
bond between the president 
and the student body … I’d 
like to see a recurring speech 
to engage students.”
Reforming printing will 
also be a focus of the cam-
paign. Akerele and Saigal 
want to improve printing by 
either reforming the mainte-
nance policies on the printers, 
or establishing more print-
ing centers both on campus 
and off, in locations such as 
Doherty Apartments, Fair-
fax, or even Beeler Street. 
The running mates also want 
to create a student-oriented 
homepage, as the current 
Carnegie Mellon website is 
more oriented toward pro-
spective students and par-
ents. The proposed homepage 
would have a link to Carn-
egie Mellon’s Blackboard and 
show what extracurricular ac-
tivities were going on around 
campus. The ?nal element 
of their campaign platform 
is improving student health. 
“When we all leave CMU, 
obviously our career is very 
important, but everyone’s 
number one priority should 
be staying alive and living 
and [being as] healthy as pos-
sible. We don’t promote that 
enough. Being healthy corre-
lates directly with happiness,” 
Saigal said. “We want to make 
better maintenance of the 
Skibo Gym — better weights, 
more fans, more air ?ow. It 
looks like a prison cell some-
times; maybe paint it up. They 
are extending the UC in two 
years, but that’s two years, 
not now.”
Akerele is a COMPASS 
Mentor, which is a peer-men-
toring program that bene?ts 
?rst-year minority students in 
science and math. He is also a 
brother of Pi Kappa Alpha, an 
RA in Doherty, and a member 
of the Committee on Student 
Organizations (CoSO). Sai-
gal is a member of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Institute of Electri-
cal and Electronics Engineers, 
the treasurer of Pi Kappa Al-
pha, and an avid Carnegie 
Mellon basketball fan.

Junior electrical and com-
puter engineering and busi-
ness administration double 
major Ian Glasner and ju-
nior biological sciences ma-
jor Shalini Ray are running 
for student body president 
(SBP) and student body vice 
president (SBVP) on a plat-
form of improving student 
policies, restructuring dining 
plans, and improving campus 
unity. Two notable reforms 
include restructuring the cur-
rent dorm alcohol policy, and 
remodeling Faculty Course 
Evaluations (FCEs). As of 
now, Carnegie Mellon’s policy 
is that if underage drinking 
is reported or discovered on 
campus or in campus hous-
ing, police respond and cite 
the students involved. Those 
students then go before the 
Pennsylvania Magistrate and 
get a state citation from gov-
ernment of Pennsylvania. 
All eight Ivy Leagues, many 
private universities, and the 
University of Pittsburgh all 
have an internal system, in 
which an RA writes the stu-
dent involved up for under-
age drinking, and the student 
goes through an internal dis-
ciplinary process. There is no 
of?cial citation. As Glasner 
put it, “It goes on your per-
manent record for school, not 
your permanent record for 
your life.”
Another notable reform 
would be reforming the cur-
rent process of FCEs. Student 
Senate is currently trying 
to reform the system, and 
Glasner and Ray would con-
tinue those efforts. “If you 
drop a class in the ?rst three 
weeks because the professor 
was awful, you don’t partici-
pate in FCEs. That’s a huge, 
huge, gap,” Glasner said.
Most of Glasner and Ray’s 
platform centers on increas-
ing student input. “Students 
need to be involved, and if 
students were involved, they 
wouldn’t miss stuff like this,” 
Glasner continued. “It’s not 
like they should have seen it, 
it’s just that students need to 
be in the room when policy is 
created. Students are the cus-
tomers on this campus, we’re 
where all the money comes 
from, and it’s unfair to us to 
leave us out of the discus-
sion.”
Both Glasner and Ray ex-
pressed their commitment 
to improving student life. “It 
would be a huge honor be-
cause being SBVP means that 
my peers trust my decisions 
and value (my) judgment 
and it places me in a position 
where I can make a tangible 
effect on student life on cam-
pus,” Ray said via email.
Glasner is the Community 
Advisor (CA) at the Residence 
on Fifth, and will be the CA 
for Resnik and West Wing 
next year. He is a co-founder 
of CMU in Haiti, as well as 
a brother of Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon.
Ray is a member of Carn-
egie Mellon’s bhangra team, 
the social chair for the Lunar 
Gala fashion show, a sister of 
Kappa Alpha Theta, a Student 
Senator and the vice chair of 
Student Senate. She is also a 
kickoff committee member of 
1000 Plus, a show board mem-
ber of Mayur SASA, a member 
of Bhangra in the Burgh, OM, 
Doctors of Carnegie Society, 
Bio Student Advisor Council,

sociation of Pre-Health Stu-
dents, and a Group-X ?tness 
instructor.

Sophomore electrical and 
computer engineering major 
Divya Kothandapani is run-
ning for student body vice 
president for ?nance (SBVPF) 
on a platform of improving the 
transparency of the JFC and 
the advising resources for stu-
dent organizations.
Kothandapani wrote in an 
email, “I would like to make 
[organizations] more aware 
of the SBVPF and make myself 
approachable so [organiza-
tions] can contact me any time 
throughout the year if they are 
confused with how campus ?-
nances work and need advice 
to be successful.”
Kothandapani wrote that 
the JFC currently only meets 
at the end of the academic 
year to determine what the 
following academic year’s 
budget will be, but that orga-
nizations must manage their 
budgets themselves through-
out the year. 
She wrote that a lack of 
?nancial advising resourc-
es causes confusion and is 
a source of debt for many 
organizations.
She wrote that she would 
work to engage JFC repre-
sentatives with organizations 
to familiarize them with the 
budgeting process and to un-
derstand why certain deci-
sions are made. “The JFC ex-
ists to support [organizations] 
and it wants to help your 
[organization] succeed,” Ko-
thandapani wrote. 
“I want to create a bet-
ter, ‘friendlier’ image for this 
committee so the students 
are more comfortable and un-
derstand the importance of 
the resources it can provide.” 
Kothandapani hopes to work 
closely with the SBVPO to 
more actively help organiza-
tions with fundraising, ideas, 
support, and promotion.
When asked what she 
hopes to accomplish for herself 
in the position, Kothandapani 
wrote, “By helping [organiza-
tions] with something as im-
portant as ?nances, I would be 
proud of myself for reaching 
out to help them achieve their 
success and improving our stu-
dent activities would make me 
even more excited to come to 
school everyday and be a part 
of this community.”
She wrote that she hopes 
ot reach the student body 
even further as SBVPF to 
help a larger group — over 
200 student organizations 
— to succeed. Kothandapani 
joined Student Senate during 
her ?rst year at Carnegie Mel-
lon as a member at large, and 
later, a CIT senator. 
She has served on the Busi-
ness Affairs and Finance com-
mittees and is now the busi-
ness affairs chair. She is also 
involved with the Executive 
Committee of Student Senate. 
Kothandapani is currently 
a JFC representative as well, 
a position which she wrote 
has helped her learn the pros 
and cons of the SBVPF posi-
tion, including the strengths 
and weaknesses of the current 
system. The SBVPF chairs the 
JFC. Kothandapani’s other in-
volvement on campus includes 
treasurer for Hindu spiritual-
ity and culture organization 
OM, captain of classical Indian 
dance team Payal, a member 
of the CIT Community Build-
ing Commitee, and a Donner 
mentor.

Junior chemical engi-
neering major Elena Karras 
is running for student body 
vice president for ?nance (SB-
VPF) on a platform of creat-
ing more transparency in the 
funding process. Karras said 
she aims to create transparen-
cy through open metric meet-
ings, of?ce hours, and better-
educated JFC representatives.
Karras said she would like 
to host an open metric meet-
ing at the beginning of the 
year so that organizations 
can voice their opinions about 
what metrics the JFC should 
use to fund organizations, and 
to answer questions about the 
metrics. Typical metrics in-
clude travel, food, and lodg-
ing, among others. “It’s sort 
of a way to hear the voices of 
the people who are involved 
in the process,” Karras said 
about the potential meeting.
To keep lines of commu-
nication open between the 
SBVPF and student organiza-
tions, Karras’s platform in-
cludes expanding the of?ce 
hours that current SBVPF 
Jalen Poteat held this aca-
demic year. 
Karras said she would hold 
the of?ce hours all year, with 
increased hours during the 
budget submission period. “I 
also want to make sure that 
[organizations] feel comfort-
able coming to me with any 
questions that they have,” 
Karras said. According to Kar-
ras, organizations are often 
unaware of all of their options 
for funding, what they can 
do with their money, and the 
funding process itself.
Karras said she would re-
lease JFC applications during 
the summer and choose rep-
resentatives at the beginning 
of the academic year in order 
to train them extensively on 
the entire budget process. 
“It’s really important to 
choose [representatives] ear-
ly and make sure they’re clear 
on what the funding avenues 
are — not just the JFC process 
— but the funding process 
as a whole,” Karras said. She 
wants representatives to be 
comprehensive resources for 
their organizations.
According to her platform, 
Karras would also strengthen 
collaboration with the stu-
dent body vice president for 
organizations (SBVPO) to en-
sure that she and the SBVPO 
are both in agreement “in 
terms of where organizations 
are and what organizations 
need.”
Karras has been a mem-
ber of Student Senate and the 
JFC for two semesters, where 
she has guided organizations 
through the funding process 
as a representative. She has 
gone through the funding 
process as the treasurer for 
College Democrats too. She is 
also a part of the Internal De-
velopment Committee, which 
educates Senators about re-
cent happenings and brings 
them together as a cohesive 
body, according to Karras.
Karras is a lighting tech 
area head for Scotch’n’Soda, 
vice president of membership 
development and program-
ming for Panhellenic, a sister 
of Alpha Chi Omega, presi-
dent of College Democrats, 
and a general member of AB 
Tech, Spring Carnival Com-
mittee, and Carnegie Tech 
Radio Club.
Karras took an unusual 
road to becoming involved in 
Student Senate. 
She was originally a write-
in candidate for the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology after 
her friends voted for her. 
A write-in candidate is 
not printed on the ballot, 
but can be handwritten onto 
it by voters. 
“I stuck with it because I 
realized it was something that 
I thought was very important 
because you need people who 
are passionate about serving 
our campus and who care that 
... all organizations are being 
served to the best of their abil-
ity,” Karras said.

Junior economics major 
Matthew Greenberg is run-
ning for student body vice 
president for ?nance (SBVPF) 
on a platform of making the 
budgeting process more ef?-
cient through a two-step plan.
As SBVPF, Greenberg 
would ?rst implement a key 
performance indicator (KPI) 
to evaluate the impact that an 
organization has on the cam-
pus community, according to 
his platform. 
Greenberg said the KPI 
would be indicative of the 
organization’s performance 
during the current and previ-
ous academic year. 
At present, organizations 
are evaluated by the JFC dur-
ing the budgeting process 
mainly by their performance 
in the previous academic year 
and the word of organization 
members.
“The biggest problem with 
the funding committee as of 
right now is that you can’t 
judge an organization on 
what they’re doing this year 
and how they’re improving 
or not improving,” Greenberg 
said.
Greenberg said he would 
require JFC representatives 
to go to the biggest events — 
and possibly a few minor ones 
— for organizations that they 
represent, in order to more di-
rectly see the impact the orga-
nizations have on the campus 
during the current year.
Greenberg is also propos-
ing to reform the JFC repre-
sentative selection process so 
there are two selection peri-
ods — one in the spring and 
one in the fall. 
According to his platform, 
Greenberg would establish an 
early-decision type process to 
choose JFC representatives. 
During the spring, “[Rep-
resentatives] who have a 
good reputation and who 
didn’t do a bad job would 
have the option to retake their 
seat the next year,” Greenberg 
said. Students who were not 
previously representatives 
would also be able to apply 
for positions at the same time, 
according to Greenberg.
If positions remained open 
after the spring selection, 
Greenberg said there would 
be a fall selection similar to 
the selection that occurs now. 
“That way the best [represen-
tatives] will still be there, will 
be trained, and will have the 
ability to use this KPI to judge 
performance and to judge im-
pact of the organizations and 
... be able to teach the new 
[representatives] how to do 
that,” Greenberg said.
Greenberg is the CEO of 
his own company, Greenberg 
& Bao Portfolio Strategies, 
LLC, which identi?es market 
inef?ciencies. 
He is a brother of Pi Kappa 
Alpha and was the chair of 
the fourth annual Matthew 
Tembo Memorial Soccer 
Tournament. According to a 
university news release, Pi 
Kappa Alpha hosts this soc-
cer tournament each year 
to be “a positive force in the 
prevention, treatment, edu-
cation, and research of sub-
stance abuse and alcoholism.” 
Greenberg is also a member 
of the Undergraduate Finance 
Association.
When asked what he hopes 
to accomplish for himself 
through the position, Green-
berg said, “I think it will help 
me to ?ne-tune my skills both 
as a CEO and just generally 
dealing with money on a daily 
basis.” 
He said that the position 
would also give him good ex-
perience in leading a group of 
people to develop an ef?cient 
budget. Greenberg stressed 
the in?uence that the SBVPF 
has to improve student life. 
“Especially at a school 
where everyone’s working so 
hard, it’s important that you 
get the best quality of life that 
you can have here ... and the 
VPF certainly has the abil-
ity to impact that,” Greenberg 
said.

Google Glass, a set of 
glasses that will stream an 
augmented reality pertinent 
to one’s surroundings has re-
cently sparked a new debate 
about the way technology af-
fects our lives. Augmented re-
ality is a perfectly clear view 
of the world that is supple-
mented, or augmented, by 
computer-generated sensory 
input. It’s the idea that we can 
stay forever plugged in to the 
Internet and our surround-
ings. Wearing Glass will pro-
vide us with a constant stream 
of information about where 
we’re headed and with whom 
we’re talking. Programmed to 
get smarter over time about 
the types of information it 
provides us, the glasses re-
spond to movements in the 
eyes, rather than physical 
controls.
While the capabilities 
of Glass all sound advanta-
geous, one of the questions 
that Google still hasn’t been 
able to answer about the 
device is how much it will 
distract users. Until the tech-
nology improves, the biggest 
danger with Glass and other 
types of augmented reality 
is that those wearing them 
have to constantly focus and 
re-focus their eyes to see 
both the world around them 
and the text on their screen. 
For example, wearing Glass 
while driving, although help-
ful from a navigation per-
spective, could be incredibly 
dangerous because drivers 
will be focusing on reading 
directions from Google Maps 
instead of on the road.
Perhaps just as impor-
tant of a question is that of 
privacy. Do we really want 
people knowing where we 
are at all times? Checking in 
on Facebook is a conscious 
decision we make; there’s no 
automatic feature that will 
post where we are at all times. 
With Glass, there’s a constant 
record of where you go and 
what you do. Glass has a cam-
era feature, where you can 
take pictures and videos of 
whatever you want. If some-
one pulls out their cell phone, 
those around them can see 
what they’re doing, but Glass 
users can take pictures or vid-
eos without anyone knowing.
How private will pictures 
and videos be? And will law 
enforcement or the NSA ever 
have access to pictures taken 
by Glass users that might be 
evidence of criminal activity? 
Do we really want to be talk-
ing to someone who is wear-
ing a device that can tell what 
kind of mood we are in or in-
stantly pull up our Facebook 
page? On the other hand, 
Glass could make strides so-
cially for people with autism 
or prosopagnosia, a disorder 
that causes a person to have 
dif?culty recognizing faces.
When Apple’s Siri was ?rst 
released, it was anticipated by 
Forbes to be one of the most 
potent and in?uential tech-
nologies ever released, but 
after only a few months it fell 
completely out of favor. The 
frenzy over Glass may also 
be completely forgotten in a 
few years. Augmented reality 
prompts us to consider what 
we lose socially to technology.

With a constant demand 
for cleaner energy sources 
as technology advances, one 
alternative that has been re-
ceiving a lot of attention in 
recent years is electric cars. It 
has been a goal among many 
researchers to cut the cost of 
batteries in electric cars so 
that the vehicles can become 
a competitive alternative to 
the traditional engine-oper-
ated cars.
In 2010, researchers at 
the Korea Advanced Insti-
tute of Science and Technol-
ogy (KAIST) developed a 
wireless charging technol-
ogy called Shaped Magnetic 
Field in Resonance (SMFIR). 
This new method of charg-
ing is compatible with online 
electric vehicles (OLEVs) 
and could allow electric cars 
to collect electricity from a 
road-embedded charging 
system, making electric cars 
a much more viable form of 
transportation.
In his 2011 paper titled 
“Application of SMFIR Tech-
nology to Future Urban 
Transportation,” professor 
of the Graduate School for 
Green Transportation at 
KAIST In-Soo Suh states that 
“SMFIR technology enables 
the electric vehicle to be 
charged while the vehicle is 
in motion” as opposed to be-
ing charged from traditional 
charging stations. Power 
cables embedded in the road 
create magnetic ?uxes, which 
can be collected by OLEVs to 
fuel them.
The charging mechanism 
on the road gets activated 
only when OLEVs run over 
it, so other vehicles will not 
be hindered by the magnetic 
?eld. When an OLEV hovers 
over the charging mecha-
nism, a power inverter in-
stalled on the road lets cur-
rent ?ow. Then the pickup 
device — made of a ferrite 
core and coiled with copper 
wires — installed under-
neath the vehicle collects 
the magnetic ?ux. After the 
induced current of collected 
magnetic ?ux is converted 
into DC power, the Power 
Distribution Unit (PDU) then 
distributes it to the appropri-
ate sectors within the vehicle. 
The harvested electricity 
can be either used to operate 
the electric motor or can be 
stored in a battery for emer-
gency purposes. This battery 
is one-third to one-?fth the 
size of the battery for tradi-
tional electric vehicles be-
cause OLEV does not require 
as much storage space. Also, 
vehicles can be charged ei-
ther when they are running 
or when they are stationary. 
According to KAIST, only 5 to 
15 percent of the road needs 
to have charging devices im-
planted in order for the ve-
hicles to safely operate.
Suh’s paper further ex-
plains the processes of wire-
less power transfer systems: 
the supply mechanism em-
bedded on the road oper-
ates by having multiple seg-
ments of powered cable loops 
with various lengths. Each

According to the U.S. Geo-
logical Survey, a toilet ?ush 
uses anywhere from one to 
four gallons of water. What 
happens to all of this wa-
ter? Does it all go to waste? 
Last Friday, Mark van Loos-
drecht, professor of environ-
mental biotechnology at the 
Delft University of Technol-
ogy in the Netherlands, gave 
a lecture on “Waste-Based 
Biore?neries.”
Van Loosdrecht, an As-
sociation of Environmental 
Engineering and Science 
Professors (AEESP) Founda-
tion 2013–14 distinguished 
lecturer, has been a profes-
sor at the Delft University of 
Technology for over 25 years, 
and is well known for his re-
search in bio?lm and granular 
sludge systems for wastewa-
ter treatment.
The lecture, sponsored 
in part by the civil and envi-
ronmental engineering de-
partment at the University 
of Pittsburgh, discussed how 
wastewater is recycled into 
viable components, such as 
chemicals and cellulose ?bers.
The original purpose of 
wastewater treatment, van 
Loosdrecht said, was sanita-
tion. In the 1970s, however, 
many people became more 
environmentally aware and 
realized the potential of reus-
ing wastewater and the com-
ponents of biological waste 
to produce chemicals or even 
energy.
“Today we call it resource 
recovery, when we get things 
out of the water to use again, 
like phosphates,” van Loos-
drecht said. “In the future, 
we think we could really in-
tegrate this into production 
cycles — integrate it into the 
chemical industry.”
Recently, the focus of 
wastewater recovery research 
has shifted to the production 
of energy from the associ-
ated biological waste. This 
research, however, is dif-
?cult to do on a large scale 
in an economically- and 
energy-ef?cient manner.
Van Loosdrecht began 
with a discussion of common 
resource recovery practices, 
such as recycling cellulose ?-
bers from the toilet paper in 
wastewater. 
Although these ?bers can 
be recycled into new toilet 
paper, van Loosdrecht said, 
it would be dif?cult to ?nd a 
market for this method. In-
stead, the ?bers — which are 
separated from wastewater 
with sieves — are used as a 
component of road asphalt, 
where the length and quality 
of the ?bers is irrelevant.
Van Loosdrecht discussed 
many of the important chemi-
cal products that can be ex-
tracted from wastewater, and 
the existing processes for such 
extraction.
Polyhydroxyalkanoates — 
better known as PHAs — for 
example, can be used for a va-
riety of applications ranging 
from making plastics to paper 
to probiotics in ?sh food. PHA 
is produced by many of the 
bacteria found in the organic 
waste that can be separated 
from waste water.
“It’s an interesting com-
pound — PHA — because al-
most every bacteria can make 
it. It’s almost more interesting 
to study which bacteria can’t 
make it,” van Loosdrecht said. 
“It is stored inside the cell 
granules, so you can easily ex-
tract it by just separating the 
cells, by centrifuge or other 
methods.”
Van Loosdrecht helped de-
velop a new photosynthesis 
and feeding cycle that helps 
such bacteria grow and pro-
duce more PHA.
Another important byprod-
uct of wastewater is alginates. 
Alginates, which are typically 
extracted from seaweed, are 
used widely in the food, tex-
tile, and pharmaceutical in-
dustries. Van Loosdrecht was 
also part of the research that 
led to the Anammox reactor. 
Anammox, which is short for 
anaerobic ammonium oxida-
tion, was a process discovered 
in the late 1990s that converts 
nitrite and ammonium — two 
byproducts of wastewater re-
?nement — into nitrogen gas.
Van Loosdrecht received 
his masters and Ph.D. from 
Wageningen University, and 
is a member of the Nether-
lands Academy of Technology 
and Innovation, as well as the 
Royal Netherlands Academy 
of Arts and Sciences.

Last November, astrophysi-
cist Alan H. Guth — Victor F. 
Weisskopf professor of phys-
ics and a Margaret MacVicar 
fellow at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology — dis-
cussed the theory of in?ation 
in his lecture “In?ationary 
Cosmology: Is Our Universe 
Part of a Multiverse” at Carn-
egie Mellon. The presence of 
such a world-renowned physi-
cist on campus caused quite a 
?urry of excitement, but now 
Guth’s lecture has an added 
signi?cance: Evidence for 
the theory of in?ation, which 
Guth ?rst proposed in 1980, 
was ?nally con?rmed this past 
Monday.
When our universe was 
approximately 380,000 years 
old, the Cosmic Microwave 
Background (CMB) came into 
existence. In its earliest stages, 
long before the formation of 
stars and planets, the uni-
verse was a very hot and dense 
place, where protons and elec-
trons moved around freely in 
plasma. 
As the universe expanded 
and cooled, protons were able 
to combine with electrons to 
form hydrogen and photons 
began to decouple from the 
matter, leaving behind the 
CMB — a faint radiation echo 
of the Big Bang that permeates 
the entire universe.
However, according to 
physicsworld.com, the CMB 
showed that the universe is 
homogeneous, ?at, and iso-
tropic, which is contrary to 
the highly curved and hetero-
geneous structure suggested 
by the Big Bang Theory. It 
was this disagreement which 
prompted Guth to propose the 
theory of in?ation.
In?ation is the idea that 
fractions of a second after 
the Big Bang — within 10-34 
seconds — the universe un-
derwent a period of expo-
nential expansion in which it 
increased at a rate faster than 
the speed of light. According 
to PBS, the universe expanded 
by at least a factor of 1025 dur-
ing this minuscule period of 
time. This rapid expansion ac-
counts for the smooth and ?at 
appearance of the CMB.
So how can an event that 
occurred 13.8 billion years 
ago be con?rmed? Accord-
ing to CNN Tech, there are 
tiny ripples in the fabric of 
spacetime called quantum 
?uctuations that were blown 
up during in?ation, launching 
gravitational waves that can 
be observed in the CMB today. 
As the waves pass through 
spacetime, they will squeeze 
the fabric in one direction 
and stretch it in another, cre-
ating two types of polariza-
tion known as E-modes and 
B-modes.
While E-modes have 
already been detected in the 
CMB, they can also be a result 
of other mechanisms. This 
past Monday, however, the 
Background Imaging of Cos-
mic Extragalactic Polarization 
telescope (BICEP2), which 
scans the sky from the south 
pole, ?nally detected B-mode 
polarization.
According to universetoday.
com, other teams will continue 
to verify these results from 
their own measurements in 
the next year. The con?rma-
tion of the theory of in?ation 
not only validates the origin 
of the structure of the uni-
verse, but also predicts the 
existence of a multiverse — an 
entire collection of multiple 
universes.
segment has two cable lines 
with currents of opposite 
directions, which creates a 
dense magnetic ?ux in be-
tween the cables. 
When the sensor on the 
road detects an OLEV, the 
powered cable loops begin 
the supply process. The fer-
rite structure within the seg-
ment determines the shape 
of the magnetic ?eld, which 
in?uences the density of the 
magnetic ?ux. 
Thus, depending on the 
vehicle pro?le — such as its 
speed and acceleration — on 
certain parts of the road, de-
sign decisions of the supply 
mechanism (such as where 
to install it or how long the 
segment should be) can be 
altered for the optimum ef-
?ciency.
Currently, OLEVs are be-
ing tested in many regions of 
Korea. 
Since March 2010, OLEV 
trams in Seoul Grand Park in 
South Korea have been used 
to transport visitors to vari-
ous destinations around the 
park. Also, since last July, 
OLEV buses have been tested 
as a public transportation 
system for Gumi-Si in Korea. 
OLEVs are an optimal ?t for 
public transportation sys-
tems like buses and trains, 
as those vehicles operate on 
predetermined tracks, allow-
ing for easier and more ef-
?cient installation of power 
cables.

Climate change, Lyme disease linked
Researchers from the Pub-

in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec 
have discovered evidence that 
global warming could pro-
mote the spread of Lyme dis-
ease. They discovered that the 
spread of mild temperatures 
between 1971 and 2010 corre-
sponded with the distribution 
of the deer tick Ixodes scapu-

Over the past few decades, the

Lyme disease will continue to

Calcium to prevent alcoholism relapse
Researchers at the Central 
Institute of Mental Health and 
the University of Heidelberg 
in Mannheim, Germany have 
gathered data that suggests 
that the calcium ions present 
in acamprosate, a drug ap-
proved as treatment for alco-
holism, could be the active in-
gredient, not the acamprosate 
itself. The team previously 
determined that abstinence 
from alcohol raises glutamate 
levels, which makes a person 
more likely to relapse into 
alcoholism. The team’s new 
research suggests that the cal-
cium present in the drug re-
duces glutamate levels, which 
suggests that acamprosate it-
self is inactive.

Being ‘good soldier’ is no excuse for assault
Banning ‘bossy’ encourages girls as leaders
Block housing gives some unfair advantages 
On March 11, the United States 
Senate managed to unanimously 
approve a resolution. The 97—0 
vote was in favor of a bill that made 
numerous changes to the military’s 
sexual assault policies, most nota-
bly getting rid of the “good soldier” 
defense in cases of alleged sexual 
assault.
Under the current system, a sol-
dier’s good performance and pristine 
military record may be presented 
in his or her defense when charged 
with sexual assault of a fellow mem-
ber of the military. Senator Claire 
McCaskill described the good sol-
dier defense as “the ridiculous no-
tion that how well one ?ies a plane 
should have anything to do with 
whether they committed a crime.”
As Major Franklin Rosenblatt 
wrote in a 2010 journal article pub-
lished in The Army Lawyer quoted by 
Time Magazine, “In application, char-
acter witnesses are commonly called 
to testify about their willingness to 
deploy with an accused. Other al-
lowable ‘good military character’ 
testimony includes that an accused 
is ‘dedicated to being a good drill in-
structor,’ lawful, easygoing, depend-
able, and well liked. With so many 
traits to choose from that are permis-
sible and admissible, nearly anyone 
can qualify as a `good soldier.’” 
Evidence had increasingly come 
to light regarding the number of un-
reported, unprosecuted sexual as-
sault incidences in the United States 
military, and removing this defense 
is an excellent step toward properly 
punishing those who commit sexual 
assault.
This bill now has to pass the Unit-
ed States House of Representatives. 
Many hope that the measure will be 
passed in an effort to promote the 
prosecution and prevention of mili-
tary sexual assault. Doing away with 
the absurd good soldier defense is 
certainly a step in the right direction.
Facebook executive Sheryl Sand-
berg recently launched the Ban 
Bossy Campaign with Lean In and 
the Girl Scouts of America. The cam-
paign seeks to stop people from call-
ing young girls “bossy”, as the term is 
inherently gendered and always pe-
jorative, and discourages the cultiva-
tion of leadership qualities in young 
girls. Notable participants include 
former Secretary of State Condo-
leezza Rice and Beyoncé, as well as 
Jane Lynch. 
Some critics of Ban Bossy claim 
that the campaign itself is ridicu-
lous — that banning language is use-
less and does not effect change, that 
women should just deal with being 
called bossy, and that young girls 
shouldn’t be bossy anyway. 
These particular criticisms miss 
the true purpose of the campaign. 
Ban Bossy seeks to make people un-
derstand that language has impact, 
most especially on young children, 
and that the cultural practice of dis-
couraging young girls from pursuing 
leadership starts very early in chil-
dren’s lives. The eradication of the 
word “bossy” will not end sexism in 
the United States; it’s just one word, 
and grown, professional women are 
not the target of the campaign. 
The point of the campaign is that 
we use the word “bossy” to shame 
female children when they express 
themselves. Parents and teachers 
should curtail controlling or overly 
aggressive behavior in children while 
raising them to be functional adults, 
but when boys exhibit such tenden-
cies, the usual response is something 
along the lines of “boys will be boys.” 
By this mindset, when boys act on 
aggression, they are manifesting a 
natural instinct. 
When girls exhibit aggression, 
they are behaving in a way that is 
somehow shameful and to be dis-
couraged. 
This cultural tendency both en-
courages and excuses aggression in 
boys that can easily become violence 
in men, and teaches girls to censor 
themselves — to be smaller, quieter, 
and more compliant. This gendered 
disparity is what the Ban Bossy Cam-
paign is trying to right.
Ban Bossy has an added impor-
tance for young girls of color in the 
United State as they grow up and 
begin to take leadership roles. While 
adult white women are at a disad-
vantage in the labor market, adult 
women of color are at an even great-
er one. 
White women earn 77 cents for 
every dollar white men make, on 
average. Black women earn 64 cents 
for every dollar, and Latina wom-
en earn 55 cents, according to the 
Center for American Progress. The 
myriad of ways in which sexism and 
racism intersect in the United States 
means that young women of color 
need even more support in their de-
velopment as young leaders. 
It’s true that banning the word 
“bossy” itself will not have much 
cultural effect; but the campaign is 
important and necessary because it 
seeks to make people think about the 
way they use language, and all the 
implications that words can carry. 
In response to student demand, 
Housing and Dining Services will 
now offer block housing in More-
wood Gardens for students choos-
ing to live with a group of six to 12 
friends or peers.
Housing and Dining Services’ 
choice to offer block housing in 
Morewood Gardens provides stu-
dents looking to remain with their 
friends an option in a central loca-
tion on campus, but the process must 
be altered in future years to accom-
modate students choosing to partici-
pate in general housing selection. 
The option for block housing in 
Morewood Gardens is a welcome 
addition in a move to offer students 
a wider variety of choice during the 
housing selection process. 
The Tartan also appreciates that 
Housing and Dining Services took 
student demand into account when 
making the decision to offer block 
housing in a dorm-style location. 
Previously, students could only 
choose block housing in Webster, 
Fairfax, Neville, Shady Oak, and 
Shirley Apartments, which are all 
off-campus and apartment-style.
As Housing and Dining Services 
revisits block housing for the 2015-16 
room selection process. However, 
the process should be altered further 
to take into account the incentives 
that offering block housing in a wid-
er range of locations could create. 
Currently, students could choose 
block housing because they receive 
priority for room selection over those 
participating in general room selec-
tion. While the option of block hous-
ing bene?ts students who are able 
to ?nd a group of friends to form a 
block with, the system could be det-
rimental to students who are unable 
to do so. 
Block housing has the potential 
to force students who choose to live 
with a random roommate or room-
mates into rooms left over after 
block housing selection. Offering 
block housing in a dorm known as a 
central building for upperclassmen 
could severely limit the choices of 
upperclassmen to obtain the housing 
they want as they compete with stu-
dent blocks.
As Housing and Dining Services 
continues to improve the room selec-
tion process, they should consider 
altering the time at which students 
choose block housing, so that those 
participating in general room selec-
tion can compete. 
For example, for next year, blocks 
could choose a number in the gener-
al housing selection process or they 
could be limited to certain ?oors of 
dorm-style locations to provide other 
students the opportunity to obtain 
their preferred housing. Otherwise, 
these students have much fewer 
options to choose from in room 
selection.
JUSTIN MCGOWN 
Take a moment and think of your 
biggest complaint about the United 
States. If you’re like me, our pen-
chant for intervening in the affairs 
of other nations is probably near the 
top of the list. A close second place 
in the race for worst thing about 
the States might belong to the un-
restrained corporate greed — at the 
detriment of employees, consum-
ers, and the environment — which 
is either supported or unopposed by 
the government. The maltreatment 
of ethnic minorities and the LGBT 
community by both individuals and 
institutions is also a front-runner.
The list goes on. From govern-
ment surveillance to widespread 
corruption of both law enforce-
ment and bureaucracy, it’s pretty 
easy to see that there’s a lot wrong 
with the United States of America. 
As such, a degree of cynicism and 
suspicion is an unsurprising and ra-
tional response to the actions of our 
government. 
So when Vladimir Putin and his 
government decries United States 
and European Union (EU) state-
ments condemning the Russian in-
tervention in Crimea by claiming 
“the pot is calling the kettle black,” 
one has to admit he has a point.
But that does not mean the ket-
tle isn’t black. Apart from gun laws 
that line up with what many liber-
als would like to see in the United 
States, almost any issue one might 
take with America is not only pres-
ent, but likely more pronounced in 
Russia. 
While the attempts by certain 
states to pass laws legalizing dis-
crimination against homosexuals in 
the name of “religious liberty” are 
a frightening step backward that 
we need to acknowledge and ?ght 
against, here in the United States we 
have the ability to denounce these 
laws as morally repugnant. 
In Russia, such vocal opposition 
would be illegal, as would even say-
ing that homosexuality is not a form 
of perversion in any forum where 
a minor might overhear. While the 
Olympics were taking place there 
was little controversy, since for-
eigners at Sochi were exempt from 
Russia’s anti-gay propaganda laws, 
but doing so at other times or other 
places would lead to deportation for 
foreigners or jail time for locals.
While the United States govern-
ment has little direct control over 
the country’s media, most television 
and print in Russia is controlled by 
the government. The handful of in-
dependent news and media organi-
zations must ration out their criti-
cism, lest they attract the ire of the 
Kremlin and have their assets seized 
and gifted to one of the oligarchs 
who run the massive, formerly state-
owned corporations inherited from 
the Soviet Union.
For the sake of LGBT rights and 
press freedom alone, Russian an-
nexation of Crimea should be op-
posed, or else another 10,000 square 
miles of the planet might be subject 
to brutal repression and gag laws. 
Russian media would counter this 
argument by rightly pointing to the 
United States’s habit of propping 
up repressive regimes around the 
world; America’s misadventures in 
illegal invasion need to be conceded, 
particularly in Iraq. Regardless of 
the justi?cation or the end result, 
breaching another country’s sover-
eignty is illegal and does not be?t a 
nation that considers itself a world 
leader, which is something Russia 
has not failed to point out.
Of course, if you believe RT — a 
Kremlin-funded English news TV 
outlet — or other Russian media out-
lets, Russia hasn’t put a single soldier 
on the ground in Crimea. The heav-
ily armed soldiers carrying AK-74’s, 
standard issue assault ri?es for Rus-
sian infantry; wearing Russian fa-
tigues and body armor “bought in a 
shop”, Putin asserted in a public ad-
dress; and driving Russian military 
vehicles with Russian identi?cation 
plates are Crimean “self-defense” 
forces. Crimean forces who, for 
some reason, speak with Russian ac-
cents and have admitted on camera 
that they are Russian soldiers.
Compare the troops at the Bel-
bek Air?eld standoff — where 300 
Ukrainian servicemen and their fam-
ilies marched unarmed on their own 
base and demanded to talk to an of-
?cer after warning shots were ?red 
— and the image reminiscent of the 
Maiden protesters who ousted for-
mer President Yanukovych, which 
RT is trying to advance now.
If you, like me, are opposed to any 
aspect of the conduct of the United 
States or any other Western power, 
you should be opposed to Russia’s 
indefensible lies, deceit, and aggres-
sion. People who live in glass houses 
shouldn’t throw stones, but there’s 
more than one all-window home on 
this block.

A PERSON’S OPINION
March 24, 2014 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A9
XIYU WANG 
Over the last few years, it seems 
like the housing market has ?nally 
rebounded from the last real estate 
crisis. As Mother Jones reports, hous-
ing prices in some areas have been 
rising as much as 20 percent annu-
ally. However, the homeownership 
rate is still dropping. If less people 
are buying houses and becoming 
homeowners, then why are prices 
increasing?
But you see, my friend, that cor-
porations are people too, and mul-
tiple homeownership among some 
of the largest ?nancial corporations 
has soared. Wall Street ?rms, such 
as the private equity ?rm Black-
stone, have been buying scores of 
foreclosed single family homes and 
renting them out. Armed with deep 
corporate pockets and the ability 
to pay upfront in cash, these ?rms 
are able to outbid individual buyers 
and own as many as one in every 11 
homes in some areas, according to 
bloomberg.com.
Furthermore, Blackstone and its 
competitors have begun selling se-
curities backed by rental payments 
from the properties they have pur-
chased, which — considering Wall 
Street’s last foray into the real estate 
market — should raise some alarms. 
Here’s a sequel that no one wants 
to see: from the same people who 
brought you the smash hit movie of 
2008, Real Estate Crisis: Subprime 
Meltdown, here comes the block-
buster event of the summer: Real Es-
tate Crisis 2: Rental Fever! The single 
largest question, as elaborated upon 
in a credit analysis from Standard & 
Poor, is how Blackstone and other 
companies will manage the vast 
number of single-family homes it has 
acquired to avoid disruptions to cash 
?ow. Unlike apartment buildings, 
single-family homes require more in-
dividualized care and are dispersed 
geographically, making mainte-
nance incredibly dif?cult. Horror 
stories have already emerged detail-
ing rental companies’ mismanage-
ment. In one case, a company simply 
painted over the mold in response to 
a tenant’s complaint of mold on the 
walls, The Huf?ngton Post reports.
It is also unclear how these com-
panies will ensure that their houses 
are consistently leased and that their 
tenants consistently pay. According 
to the same Mother Jones article, 
Blackstone expects that 95 percent 
of its homes will be occupied at all 
times, each with an average monthly 
rent of around $1,300. These expec-
tations may be overly ambitious for 
single-family rentals, and, therefore, 
they would need to be revised sig-
ni?cantly in the case of an economic 
downturn. Of course, the activi-
ties of these rental companies will 
need to be watched carefully, but it 
is questionable whether regulatory 
agencies will do anything about it. 
The story of the mold on the walls is 
a disturbingly apt metaphor for the 
state of American ?nancial regula-
tion over the last few decades. The 
Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act, which was 
supposed to provide more stringent 
regulation of the big banks after the 
2008 crisis, has largely remained un-
implemented, according to USA To-
day. This is especially true in regards 
to its two most important proposals: 
ending too-big-to-fail ?rms and ban-
ning proprietary trading.
While a housing bubble in itself 
may not be a bad thing, a housing 
bubble backed by unregulated, risky 
trading is a toxic combination that 
could once again implode the United 
States economy and, even worse, 
leave scores of people homeless 
without even an apartment to rent. 
The United States needs to push for 
stronger ?nancial regulation before 
events play out like they did in 2008.

2014 will be year of smart watches
BRANDON SCHMUCK 
Last year, Pebble, one of the ?rst 
smartwatches truly compatible with 
iOS and Android devices, was re-
leased via Kickstarter crowdsourc-
ing. While it has been a somewhat 
successful product, it has only man-
aged to sell around a few hundred 
thousand units and has not yet 
reached mainstream level. Despite 
the fact that Best Buy and other tech-
nology chains now carry it, those 
outside of the most tech-savvy group 
of young people do not seem to have 
been convinced yet that they need a 
smart watch.
However, the status of smart 
watches is about to change. 2014 will 
be the year of smart watches. Last 
week, Google announced that it will 
?nally be making a serious entrance 
into the market with Android Wear 
— a minimal version of the Android 
operating system created specially 
for watches, which allows voice con-
trol, noti?cations at a glance, and 
support for a wide array of health 
monitoring devices.
Additionally, Motorola an-
nounced the summer release of one 
of the ?rst devices to support this 
newly adapted operating system: the 
Moto 360. Motorola took an interest-
ing approach to the watch’s design, 
abandoning the rectangular form 
factor of previous smart watches in 
favor of a circular design resembling 
traditional watches. Motorola fo-
cused as much on the design as the 
specs and has ?nally created some-
thing that will provide people with a 
familiar, attractive design.
Google has of?cially entered the 
market, and consumers and analysts 
are anticipating an Apple iWatch to 
be released before long. Over the 
past year, Apple has hired numer-
ous health specialists, who are likely 
working on some kind of wearable 
?tness device. Last week, renderings 
of a Healthbook app — including 
real-time monitoring of various vi-
tals such as heart rate, oxygen satu-
ration, blood pressure, and more — 
were also leaked by 9to5Mac.
As Digital Trends suggests, the 
iWatch will likely provide data 
for this application — controlled 
through Siri — and carry many fea-
tures similar to Android Wear. The 
iWatch, as well as Android Wear 
devices, will not attempt to replace 
current smartphones, but to supple-
ment them. These devices will pro-
vide a minimal always-on display 
of noti?cations, events, and more, 
meaning that people will ?nally be 
able to keep their phones in their 
pockets and focus more on the peo-
ple around them.
The arrival of mainstream smart 
watches represents a change in life-
style, in which technology becomes 
more continuously integrated into 
our lives. Instead of constantly 
reaching for our phones and taking 
time out of our lives to monitor no-
ti?cations and events through vari-
ous apps, we will always be able to 
obtain a given moment’s most im-
portant information with a simple 
glance at our wrists.
It’s ironic to think that new tech-
nology may allow us to become more 
sociable and ?t, instead of the usual 
opposite result. The fact that we will 
be able to simply glance at our noti-
?cations, like people have glanced 
at watches for centuries, means that 
we will spend less time in the digi-
tal world and more time in the real 
world, while staying connected si-
multaneously. 
Because smart watches provide 
useful features and are now more 
similar to traditional watches that 
are already mainstream, people will 
soon be lining the stores to get their 
own.

Obama’s presidency may as well 
have eight months left. Now even 
Nate Silver, former New York Times 
statistics whiz, is predicting that Re-
publicans are more likely than not to 
win control of the Senate in 2014.
If that happens, President 
Obama’s last two years will be a bru-
tal struggle against Congress with 
little to show for the ?rst six years 
of his presidency but a stimulus of 
questionable ef?cacy and a health-
care act that’s hurt more people 
than it’s helped.
Let’s take a look at the races in 
2014. One must remember that Sen-
ate seats go up for election every six 
years, which means that the Sena-
tors up for re-election in this cycle 
are the same ones who won in 2008, 
a wave election year for Democrats. 
As a result, Democrats are defend-
ing 21 seats and Republicans are de-
fending only 15. In a Senate where 
Democrats control 55 total seats and 
Republicans control the remaining 
45, Republicans only need to pick up 
six seats in 2014 to gain the majority.
Of the 36 seats up for election 
this year, some are totally safe, as 
popular incumbents are seeking 
re-election in states that generally 
vote for their party. John Cornyn 
(R–Texas), a two-term incumbent, 
probably won’t lose, just as three-
term incumbent Jack Reed (D–R.I.), 
whose race is currently uncontested, 
won’t lose.
Eliminating those seats leaves 
us with Democrats defending eight 
competitive seats and Republicans 
defending two — still not a pretty 
outlook for the president’s party, 
especially considering that Repub-
licans are defending two seats in 
Georgia and Kentucky, two solidly 
Republican states.
Exacerbating this situation for 
Democrats is a retirement wave 
where many of their most popular 
incumbents are retiring from sena-
torship after serving multiple terms. 
Montana, a state that Mitt Romney 
carried by double digits in 2012, is 
losing veteran senator Max Baucus 
(D–Mont.), who has decided not to 
run in 2014, instead assuming the 
role of ambassador to China. Even 
though the fundamentals of a Sen-
ate election in Montana favor Re-
publicans, a superstar candidate like 
Baucus whose name is well known 
and who polls exceptionally well, 
would make this a tough pickup for 
Republicans.
Without the bene?ts of incum-
bency to in?uence the election, two 
fresh names on the ballot will likely 
fall prey to the state’s fundamentals, 
which favor Republicans and the 
most statistically signi?cant factor in 
midterm elections: the president’s 
approval rating, which is hovering 
around a markedly low 43 percent.
Democrats have a similar situ-
ation in West Virginia, where Jay 
Rockefeller (D–W.Va.) decided not 
to run for re-election, putting a state 
that’s been hit the hardest by Demo-
crats’ regulation on coal, safely in 
Republican territory. Add South Da-
kota to that list, and already Repub-
licans are looking at three easy pick-
ups, shifting the Senate landscape to 
52 Democrats and 48 Republicans.
The next wave of possible Repub-
lican pickups comes form a group of 
Senators in traditionally red states 
that Mitt Romney won in 2012. This 
is where Obamacare and the toxic 
political atmosphere for Democrats 
comes into play. Mark Pryor (D–
Ark.), Kay Hagan (D–N.C.), Mark 
Begich (D–Ala.), and Mary Landrieu 
(D–La.) are already fending off ad-
vertisements labeling them as the 
deciding vote for Obamacare. Re-
cent polling puts their chances even 
with or slightly below their poten-
tial Republican competitors, as pri-
maries aren’t over yet. However, as 
we’ve seen in every election, a par-
ty’s candidates always suffer in poll-
ing during their primaries, so expect 
those four Senators’ races to sway a 
few additional points toward Repub-
licans as primaries come to a close.
If Republicans pick up three of 
those four seats, they’ve already 
won the majority and that’s not even 
counting other potential pickups. 
Superstar Scott Brown (R–Mass.) 
just announced his candidacy in 
New Hampshire after moving there 
early this year, Carl Levin (D–Mich.) 
retired, and though Michigan is a 
traditionally liberal state, it is quite 
possible that Republicans will nomi-
nate a better candidate than Demo-
crats and carry the race.
Additionally, Tom Harkin (D–
Iowa) just retired, and a high-qual-
ity Republican candidate could put a 
state whose most famed newspaper, 
the Des Moines Register, ended 30-
plus years of endorsing Democrats 
to endorse Mitt Romney in 2012. 
Finally, Al Franken (D–Minn.) won 
a highly controversial race in 2008, 
and barely walked away with the 
victory. Obama additionally only 
carried the state with 52 percent of 
the vote in 2012. Now that the land-
scape is much more toxic to Demo-
crats, a Republican pickup is not out 
of the question.
So what happens if Republicans 
do pick up the Senate? Obama has 
had a great time being able to paint 
Republicans as obstructionists, as 
his agenda has been primarily op-
posed by a Republican majority in 
the House of Representatives, which 
polling concludes is likely to stick 
around in 2014. If Republicans take 
over the Senate, Obama’s whole 
“one half of one house is opposing 
my agenda” narrative turns into 
“one man against Congress.”
If history is any guide, the Ameri-
can people generally don’t like presi-
dents that defy the will of Congress, 
as it stings of tyranny. Obama’s 
agenda will be effectively dead, and 
he’ll be forced to comply with the 
will of an adversarial Congress, or 
be de?ned as an in?exible, imperi-
alistic ideologue for abusing his veto 
power. Either way, Obama’s days of 
creating and pushing an agenda are 
over, and the president whose candi-
dacy marked the self-declared “mo-
ment when the rise of the oceans 
began to slow, and our planet began 
to heal” will be reduced to nothing 
more than a lame duck.

March Madness is upon us
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
The ?rst week of March 
Madness may as well be a na-
tional holiday. Starting Thurs-
day, there has been nonstop 
college basketball from noon 
until after midnight. Mil-
lions of hours of productiv-
ity go down the drain for the 
economy as every sports fan 
tries to ?nd an excuse to miss 
work and those poor souls 
stuck in a cubicle constantly 
check scores and their brack-
ets. There are the discreet 
workers, as more brazen ones 
just watch the games with 
the NCAA website streaming 
every game for free, com-
plete with a “Boss Button” 
that quickly pulls up a faux 
spreadsheet to give the allu-
sion of being busy. Men are so 
desperate to get out of work to 
watch the games that vasecto-
mies rise nearly a thousand 
percent the week leading up 
to the ?rst weekend as the 
forced seated recovery period 
is the perfect excuse to stay 
home and sit on the couch 
while watching the game.
The only redeeming fac-
tor for the economy is the 
massive upswell of gambling, 
through of?ce pools and Las 
Vegas sports bookies. March 
Madness is the perfect storm 
of gambling. The ?xed brack-
et, propensity for upsets, 
and near in?nite possibilities 
make it exciting for everyone 
from the college basketball 
a?cionado to the sports nov-
ice who chose their bracket 
based on mascot cuteness. 
The odds of a perfect bracket 
are so astronomically low that 
billionaire Warren Buffett was 
willing to offer a billion dol-
lars to anyone on Yahoo with 
a perfect bracket. By the end 
of the second day, no one who 
entered the competition was 
left unscathed and only one 
bracket of the millions who 
entered via Yahoo was still 
perfect, but that only lasted 
through the next game the 
following day.
The magic of March Mad-
ness is the Cinderella. The 
low seeded, generally small 
conference team that no one 
outside of their alumni has 
ever heard from suddenly gets 
thrust into national spotlight 
with the improbable upset 
over the traditional power 
house. This year has been 
?lled with craziness; we have 
already guaranteed that at 
least one double digit seed 
will reach the elite eight, with 
10 seed Stanford and 11 seed 
Dayton set up to play in the 
Sweet Sixteen.
With the rise of the “one 
and done” ?rst-year, veteran 
mid-major teams — while 
generally having less raw 
talent, have the teamwork, 
leadership, and experience to 
beat the squads of blue-chip 
prospect mercenaries ?elded 
by the Kentuckys, Dukes and 
Kansases of the world. This 
paradigm shift, inspired by 
the change in the NBA draft 
eligibility rules — which force 
players to be one year out of 
high school before declaring 
for the draft — has dramati-
cally increased the parity in 
the tournament, making it 
even more ridiculous.
Duke University, a na-
tional powerhouse, has now 
lost in the ?rst round two of 
the last three years to a 14 
and a 15 seed. Florida Gulf 
Coast University went from a 
15 seed to the sweet sixteen, 
making history in the process. 
The only holy ground is still 
the 1 versus 16 matchup, but 
that doesn’t mean a 16 seed 
hasn’t come close. The only 
thing about number one seeds 
anymore is their propensity 
for being upset in the second 
round instead of the ?rst.
The upset has become so 
common that the 5 versus 12 
matchup is universally known 
for its upset potential. Nearly 
every year, at least one 12 
seed advances in the tourna-
ment. This year, three of the 
four 12 seeds won their games 
with the fourth — North 
Carolina State University — 
blowing a massive lead late 
in the second half and taking 
the game to overtime before 
?nally falling to the ?ve seed 
Saint Louis University.
As we progress into the 
sweet sixteen and beyond, 
the upsets should theoreti-
cally die down. Cinderella’s 
carriage is supposed to turn 
into a pumpkin as the clock 
strikes midnight and the big 
boys are supposed to duke it 
out for the title. But the last 
few years, things have not 
been going according to plan, 
and this year seems no dif-
ferent. With George Mason 
University, Butler University, 
Virginia Commonwealth Uni-
versity (VCU) and Wichita 
State University all making 
?nal four runs as low seeds 
in the last eight years, the 
blue blood schools are consis-
tently getting shown up. This 
year, traditional powerhouses 
Duke University, the Univer-
sity of North Carolina State 
University, Syracuse Univer-
sity, Ohio State University, 
Villanova University, and the 
University of Kansas, along 
with the new class of schools 
like VCU and Wichita State, 
which both received high bids 
given their recent success and 
lofty records, all got knocked 
out before the end of this ?rst 
weekend.
While March Madness has 
certainly gotten more exciting 
over the years, the quality of 
play has debatably declined 
with the decreased emphasis 
on team play and increased 
focus on raising draft stock 
for the June NBA draft. The 
college basketball purists may 
bemoan the degradation of 
their beloved sports, but I, for 
one, am thrilled at the pros-
pect that the craziest three 
weeks in basketball is on the 
path to somehow becoming 
even more ridiculous.

The nationally ranked 
Carnegie Mellon men’s and 
women’s tennis teams were 
both in action this past week-
end against other highly 
ranked opponents.
Both teams took care of 
the lower ranked University 
of Mary Washington, but the 
men’s team fell to the ?fth-
ranked Johns Hopkins squad.
On Saturday, the eighth-
ranked women’s team trav-
eled to Fredericksburg, Va. 
to face off against the 21st 
ranked Eagles. 
The Tartans continued 
their dominating season as 
they cruised to an easy 7–2 
victory.
Junior Angela Pratt and 
?rst-year Nicholle Torres, 
along with sophomores 
Brooke Tsu and Abbey Hams-
tra, jumped the Tartans out to 
an easy lead as they took two 
of the three doubles matches.
Carnegie Mellon then put 
the match away winning ?ve 
of six singles points, with Tsu 
winning without conceding a 
single game, 6–0, 6–0. 
The single Tartan loss 
came as Hamstra took the 
game to a third set, but was 
unable to pull out the vic-
tory as she fell 2–6, 6–2, 0–1 
(6–10). The 11th-ranked men 
also faced off against the 
17th-ranked Eagles, ultimate-
ly winning 6–3.
Junior Bryce Beisswanger 
and sophomore Yuvraj Kumar 
took the only Tartan doubles 
victory 8–6, but the singles 
play pushed Carnegie Mellon 
over the top.
With the exception of 
sophomore Abhishek Alla, all 
of the Tartans won their sin-
gles matches, although sever-
al required a third set to do so.
Sunday was a different 
story as the men faced ?fth 
-ranked Johns Hopkins. The 
Tartans repeated the start of 
Saturday as only one pair won 
their doubles match, although 
this time it was juniors Chris-
tian Heaney-Secord and Will 
Duncan winning 8–1.
The singles did not quite 
follow Saturday’s script, as 
only two Tartans — Heaney-
Secord and ?rst-year Kenny 
Zheng —won their matches 
by scores of 6–4, 4–6, 6–1, 
and 7–5, 6–4 respectively. 
First-year Kiril Kirkov was the 
only other player for Carnegie 
Mellon to put up much of a 
?ght as he made it to a third 
set before falling.
The Carnegie Mellon 
teams ?nd themselves on the 
lowerside of the UAA rank-
ings, but have a chance to 
improve.
The men’s tennis team will 
face off next against teams 
from Washington and Lee 
University on Saturday at 10 
a.m. at home.
The women’s team will 
host at home as well; how-
ever, their matches will not 
begin until 1 p.m.
Tennis teams win and lose

Vandenburg runs for fourth place in NCAA championships
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
Junior Thomas Vanden-
berg represented Carnegie 
Mellon University at the 2014 
NCAA Indoor Division III 
Track and Field Champion-
ships this weekend, placing 
fourth in the 800-meter run. 
“After just missing nationals 
for the past couple of years, 
making it this year was my 
number one goal,” Vanden-
berg wrote via email.
Vandenberg was the only 
Tartan to qualify for the trip 
to Nebraska to face off against 
the best track and ?eld ath-
letes in the country. 
Vandenberg quali?ed 11th 
out of 16 to make the event 
and was in the second heat of 
the preliminaries. While he 
did not ?nish in the top two 
of his Friday heat to guaran-
tee his spot in the ?nals, his 
third place ?nals ?nish, as 
well as the third place overall 
time with a 1:51.77, was good 
enough to get him a spot.
“I was really exicted to see 
how fast I ran on the ?rst day,” 
Vandenberg wrote. “I’ve al-
ways been a competitive run-
ner, so I knew if I raced against 
the top runners in the country, 
I would be able to race as fast 
as them.”
On Saturday, the ?nals 
?eld was slower as a whole, 
but Vandenberg still shined. “I 
had made nationals, so I had 
accomplished my goal, and 
running well at the meet was 
sort of the icing on the cake,” 
he wrote. 
His time of 1:52.47 was 
good enough for his fourth 
place ?nish and netted Van-
denberg the ?rst All-American 
honors of his college career. 
Vandenberg’s ?nish single-
handedly placed Carnegie 
Mellon in a tie for 42nd in the 
team scores. This event marks 
the end of the indoor track and 
?eld season, but the outdoor 
season kicks off this weekend 
at the Washington and Lee 
Track and Field Carnival.
“I took a couple of days 
off after nationals, but now 
I’m back at it. My goals are 
de?nitely to qualify again,” he 
said.
Wang was another top indi-
vidual performer placing 17th 
in the 100 meter breaststroke, 
setting a school record and 
narrowly missing out on a ?-
nals spot.
The top performers for the 
Tartans were the 200- and 
400-meter medley relay teams 
which both set school records 
and earned honorary All-
American titles in the process. 
The 200-meter team, consist-
ing of sophomore Kira Sing-
haus, Wang, Crews, and Phan 
placed 15th with a ?nals time 
of 1:45.68. The same athletes 
combined for a 14th place 
?nish in the 400-meter relay 
with a combined ?nals time of 
3:50.34.

When people think of 
sports on campus, they often 
think of varsity sports. These 
sports take an extraordinary 
amount of time and talent, 
things not everyone at Carn-
egie Mellon may have when it 
comes to athletics. However, 
for those of us who are not cut 
out for varsity or club teams, 
there are intramural (IM) 
leagues.
With the end of spring 
break came the start of a new 
lineup of intramural sports. 
Intramurals for the mini 4 
semester include badminton 
doubles, indoor soccer, soft-
ball, kickball, tennis doubles, 
and golf.
One out of ?ve students 
participates in IM leagues, ac-
cording to supervisor in athlet-
ics Colin Shaffer, a junior eth-
ics, history and public policy 
and business administration 
double major. “Participation 
numbers are constantly grow-
ing and we get a wide range 
of students,” Shaffer said in 
an email. According to coor-
dinator of intramural and club 
sports 
David 
Wiley, 
intramurals are designed so 
that you can go out and have 
fun while you play sports.
For those who do not have 
friends who participate in IM 
sports, a free agent system 
allows students to meet new 
people in the community 
while playing sports for free.
Carnegie Mellon Athletics 
provides a diverse offering of 
sports and activities through 
IM leagues. Some leagues are 
competitive, but all are open 
to any student regardless of 
talent level.
“IM sports provide an op-
portunity for any student, 
no matter what their athletic 
background, to compete and 
to have fun,” Shaffer said. 
Some of the leagues are more 
recreational, designed for stu-
dents to hang out and have 
fun. Come championship 
time, though, Shaffer said, 
“all of our sports are extreme-
ly competitive throughout the 
women’s, [co-rec], men’s [rec-
reational], and men’s compet-
itive ?nals.”
While athletes in varsity 
and club sports compete with 
students at other schools, IM 
competition remains entirely 
within the Carnegie Mellon 
community. IM leagues have 
various divisions based on the 
level of competition people 
are looking for. There are divi-
sions for students who want to 
play with no base level of tal-
ent or experience, as well as 
competitive divisions.
Beyond different divisions, 
there are also a variety of ac-
tivities. In addition to ?ve-on-
?ve basketball, there are IM 
leagues for dodgeball, inner 
tube water polo, and even a 
rock-paper-scissors tourna-
ment. Through these unique 
sports, the athletics depart-
ment aims to introduce people 
to new experiences and make 
IM sports inclusive, according 
to Shaffer. “Inner tube water 
polo is probably one of the 
most popular sports on cam-
pus simply because it is differ-
ent, it’s fun, and literally any-
one can sit in an inner tube for 
an hour and ?oat around with 
their friends,” Shaffer said.
It’s easy to get involved, 
said Wiley. Not only can stu-
dents play with friends or as 
free agents, but the games are 
also refereed by members of 
the Carnegie Mellon commu-
nity, who can be near the ac-
tion without actually playing. 
IM sports are not limited to 
students; faculty or any other 
member of the Carnegie Mel-
lon community can partici-
pate too.
With a range of activities 
designed for wide participa-
tion, IM leagues are a place 
where people can seek either 
competition or fun. “It’s a way 
to get out of the classroom 
and clear your mind,” wrote 
Wiley in an email. “An active 
mind cannot exist in an inac-
tive body.”

NISHANT RENIWAL
Junior Staffwriter
Coming off a spectacular 
February in which they went 
9–1, only losing to the Utah 
Jazz, expectations were high 
for the Miami Heat and su-
perstar small forward LeB-
ron James for the month of 
March. Last year, March was a 
good month for the Heat, who 
were in the middle of their 27-
game win streak. This streak 
helped them get the No. 1 
overall seed and home court 
advantage throughout the 
playoffs. 
However, the performance 
drop-off seen from the en-
tire team over the course of 
the last 10 games has been 
shocking and has seen them 
fall three games behind the 
Indiana Pacers in the Eastern 
Conference. They have gone 
4–6 over that stretch while 
giving up an average of 102.6 
PPG, a number unusually high 
for this team’s stingy defense. 
What has suddenly gone so 
wrong for the Heat?
The most obvious and im-
portant reason for this sud-
den drop in performance is 
the drastic failure in James’s 
performance 
since the team’s 107–124 
loss against the Charlotte 
Bobcats on March 3. Over 
the next three games, James 
did not reach even 20 points 
and made only three jump 
shots. He has not been him-
self since that game, and with 
the exception of wins against 
the Washington Huskies and 
Cleveland Cavaliers, has shot 
nowhere near his season aver-
age of 57 percent.
It doesn’t help that one of 
the best defensive players in 
the game isn’t playing any-
where near his capability on 
that end. There were several 
defensive rotations where 
James seemed lost and did 
not track his man down — 
de?nitely not the way to re-
establish himself in the MVP 
race considering fellow small 
forward and MVP rival Kevin 
Durant is in the midst of a 
33-game streak of 25 or more 
points.
Another factor working 
against the Heat is the pres-
ence of too many 
talented yet un-
derperforming role players. 
Shooting guard Ray Allen, 
one of the greatest shoot-
ers in NBA history, has been 
in a season-long slump and 
is having his worst shooting 
season statistically. He’s had 
nowhere near the impact he 
had on the Heat’s title charge 
last season. The same goes 
for small forward Shane Bat-
tier. More often than not, 
Battier has been played on 
larger power forwards for 
purely defensive purposes. 
0–5 shooting nights aren’t 
rare anymore; in fact, they’re 
becoming the norm. The Heat 
need their two premier pe-
rimeter shooters to be on top 
form to beat the Pacers or 
any possible contender in the 
loaded Western Conference. 
The likes of small forward Mi-
chael Beasley and center Greg 
Oden were supposed to be 
low-risk, high-reward moves, 
but both of them have been 
more of liabilities and have 
only displayed ?eeting 
moments to showcase 
the talent they truly 
possess.
The inconsistent 
play of the Heat’s 
other two superstars, 
forward-center Chris Bosh 
and guard Dwyane Wade, has 
also exacerbated the Heat’s 
situation. Wade looked to be 
in prime form until this re-
cent stretch and it looked like 
he would be in optimal shape 
for the playoffs, but concerns 
about his knee are resurfac-
ing, and he sat out on one 
night of back-to-backs again. 
Bosh had been on a hot streak 
recently, but his poor defense 
and lack of menac-
ing presence in the 
paint or rim pro-
tection hurt the 
Heat against the 
likes of the San 
Antonio Spurs, 
Houston Rockets 
and the Denver 
Nuggets, who all 
exploited the free-
dom in the paint. 
The Big Three 
— Bosh, James, 
and Wade — came 
together so at least 
one of them could 
pick up the slack when 
other members were 
going through 
a slump, but 
when none 
of them are 
clicking, 
the Heat 
are in 
trou-
ble.

Exhibition premieres in Hunt
Duets presents harmonious pairings of botanical artwork
Did you know that there’s a level of Hunt library 
beyond the fourth floor — a world of wonder, 
accessible only by elevator? No, it’s not the room 
made out of candy in Willy Wonka’s Chocolate 
Factory; it’s the Hunt Institute for Botanical 
Documentation.
A valued resource for the study of North American 
flora, the institute boasts an impressive collection 
of environmental art that it showcases in two 
exhibitions every year. This year’s spring exhibition, 
Duets, opened last Thursday and couples botanical 
art with items created between the 16th and 21st 
centuries.
According to assistant curator of art Carrie Roy, 
Duets attempts to “explore the history of botanical 
art through harmonious pairings.” The exhibition 
is organized into displays of two works of botanical 
art next to each other. Often, the pairs of art are of 
the same subject, but are different in regard to style, 
technique, or methods.
There is a wide variety of artwork, from pencil 
sketches and watercolors to different forms of 
photography, and this diversity keeps the gallery 
interesting. Albert G. Richards’s black-and-white 
radiograph (X-ray photograph), for example, reveals 
the inner architecture of a rose in full bloom and 
allows one to marvel at the complex nature of such a 
seemingly simple organism.
Beside each pairing is a description explaining why 
the two pieces were put together, and it is in these 
descriptions where the real meat and potatoes of 
Duets lies. Some are contrasts, others comparisons.
The subjects of the artwork range from beautiful, 
exotic flowers found only in the Amazon or other 
remote lands, to the average, everyday onion. 
Indeed, the pieces’ artists range as well from 
novices to masters. The pairing of the finely 
educated Raphael Henri-Charles Ghislain’s 
stunning watercolor of a Ranunculaceae plant with 
the untrained James Bolton’s soft, almost surreal 
watercolor of the same plant demonstrates the 
passion found in botanical art. Both of these men 
were driven by “a love of the natural world that 
propelled them both to hone their observational 
skills,” one for professional development and the 
other for simple pleasure.
According to Roy, Duets continues the Hunt 
Institute’s long history of trying to “showcase 
environmentally important issues.” She continued 
that the exhibition gives “digestible little bits of 
what we’re about and why this art is important.” 
Duets certainly provides an appreciation for the field 
of botanical art, and many of the pieces are truly 
stunning and perfect for a quick study break while 
in Hunt Library. Duets will be on display through 
June 30 on the fifth floor of the library.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Ryan and Matt,
My boyfriend is 
very outgoing, and 
he seems to know 
everybody. We can’t 
go anywhere without 
running into someone 
that was on his floor 
his first year or who 
dated his best friend. 
When we get meals 
together, I expect 
them to be quiet, but 
they turn into social 
experiences that I 
don’t want to be a part 
of. How do I tell his 
friends that he’s with 
me right now, and can 
come play later?
Sincerely, 
Mingling Yeoman, 
Toddles Intimate 
Meaning-making 
Excursions
Dear MY-TIME,
It’s nice to be with 
someone who knows 
everybody, but we 
understand your 
predicament. You might try 
talking to your boyfriend 
and letting him know that 
when you two are together, 
you expect it to be the two 
of you — together. You can 
also take the initiative to 
turn down requests to join 
his friends yourself, saying 
things like “We’d be happy 
to join you another time.”
If that doesn’t work, you 
might have to resort 
to scare tactics. Make 
mention of discussing 
things couples need privacy 
for — like a breakup or an 
unexpected pregnancy.
Have you tried staying 
in?
Matt and Ryan
Dear Matt and Ryan,
Ugghhhhh it’s after 
spring break and I 
have no motivation 
to do any work. I just 
want to go back to 
the carefree days that 
last week provided. 
Why can’t I go back? 
Why do I have to work 
again? I’m feeling so 
listless and apathetic 
right now I don’t even 
think I can fin—
Dear … um … Sir or 
Madam,
The first week back from 
spring break is always 
the worst. It’s not like the 
first week of school, when 
professors expect nothing 
and homeworks amount to 
nothing more than “read the 
syllabus.” But when you get 
back from break, it’s more 
like, “Hope you’ve been 
hitting the books this past 
week, because here’s three 
assignments and an exam 
— good luck.” So, you have 
two options now, assuming 
you haven’t done any work 
at all this week. Hit the 
ground running next week, 
picking up the slack and 
getting on top of everything 
you should have done last 
week. Or, continue to be as 
apathetic as you want. But 
seriously — get your butt in 
gear. No one’s saying you 
have to be productive all the 
time right now, and taking 
a break now and again is 
healthy. 
If life were like spring 
break forever, it wouldn’t 
feel like spring break. And 
we’d all probably be dead,
Ryan and Matt

This article contains spoilers for season four of Pretty 
Little Liars.
Last Tuesday, ABC Family aired the ?nale for season four 
of their hit television show, Pretty Little Liars. For a show 
with a storyline that’s been moving slowly lately, the 
previews for the ?nale set huge expectations. 
A number of the clips featured a scene with the show’s 
main characters brandishing a gun at the mysterious 
“A”, demanding this character to ?nally remove his 
or her mask and reveal “A”’s true identity. It gave the 
audience reason to believe that they might ?nally ?nd 
out who “A” is, and what really happened to Ali (Sasha 
Pieterse). As usual, however, Ali’s “tell-all” revealed few 
of the answers that viewers were looking for. Though 
the show generated a lot of buzz, with supposedly a 
record-breaking number of tweets, it did not live up to 
expectations.
Nevertheless, viewers were given some answers in the 
episode; after all, it was called “A is for Answers.” To 
recap, the four main characters — Aria (Lucy Hale), 
Emily (Shay Mitchell), Hanna (Ashley Benson), and 
Spencer (Troian Bellisario) — met their old friend Ali, 
who they ?nally found out was alive at the end of the last 
season. They were also able to hold a full conversation 
with her, which was another ?rst for the show. 
We learned that someone hit Ali with a rock the night 
that everyone thought she was killed, and thereafter she 
was buried alive by none other than her own mother. 
Ali was then pulled out of the ground by creepy Mrs. 
Grunwald (Meg Foster) and was convinced by Mona 
(Janel Parrish) to leave town and fake her own death. 
Meanwhile, another girl was buried in Ali’s grave and 
falsely identi?ed as Ali — a girl who was actually killed 
by Melissa (Torrey DeVitto), Spencer’s sister. It was 
somewhat unclear how that girl was killed, and why 
she was identi?ed as Ali. Adding to the drama, though 
somewhat unnecessarily, “A” shot Ezra (CMU alumni Ian 
Harding).
The show’s writers continued the show’s habit of 
generating more questions for whatever answers were 
given. One question that the show will de?nitely focus 
on in the upcoming season, premiering June 10, is why 
Ali’s mother was willing to bury her daughter. Who 
tried to kill Ali, and why is the would-be killer’s identity 
important enough for Ali’s mother to keep silent?
As for Ezra, most people know or expect that he will still 
be alive in the next season, especially since there are a 
lot of questions that he needs to answer. According to 
an interview, Harding revealed that there would be a 
love triangle between Aria, Ali, and Ezra next season. I 
predict that it will end well for “Ezria” fans, but no one 
can know for sure.
Other questions include the role that each character 
has in this show. Obviously the main characters have 
a purpose, but was CeCe Drake (Vanessa Ray) just 
placed on the show as a distraction or was she somehow 
involved? And what about Jason (Drew Van Acker), 
Wren (Julian Morris), and other random characters? 
It seems as though there were several storylines that 
started in the show, but then did not lead anywhere 
and had to come to a halt. It would be nice to see them 
attended to next season.
Despite the episode’s ?aws, there were some positives 
as well, including the fashion seen on the show. While 
Pretty Little Liars is known for the fashionable out?ts put 
together for each character by costume designer Mandi 
Line, sometimes the out?ts can be hit-or-miss. This 
episode, however, did not disappoint, with the exception 
being Spencer’s weird sweater.
This episode began with the same scene in which the 
penultimate episode ended. It was dif?cult to really see 
what each character was wearing, but most noticeable 
were Aria’s colorful scarf, Hanna’s patterned leather 
jacket, Emily’s leather jacket, and Spencer’s cutout 
turtleneck sweater (even the name doesn’t sound 
appealing). A few scenes later, Ali’s white  sequined 
top — another fashion standout from this episode — 
appeared when she went to the bar to meet Ezra.
The weirdest part of this episode — and the one that’ll 
probably lead to the most questions — is the scene 
where Ali’s mother is seen being buried in a grave while 
still alive. It’s obviously connected to the way Ali “died,” 
but still confusing, since Ali’s mother basically helped 
to kill Ali. Judging by the lack of answers given in this 
episode, we’ll only have to wait a few more hundred 
episodes before we ?nally ?nd out who “A” is.

Greek Sing showcases member talents
Performances ranged from Broadway-style professional productions to laid back skits
Greek Sing, Carnegie Mellon’s largest student-organized 
philanthropic event, took place last Saturday at Soldiers 
& Sailors Memorial Hall. The event raised over $90,000 
for The Children’s Institute, the organization that 
Greek Sing has partnered with the past four years and 
for which they have raised over $250,000 in total. The 
performances ranged from self-aware comic skits to 
professional and precise Broadway-style productions, 
but all were brimming with an energy and enthusiasm 
that was palpable throughout the auditorium.
The evening was broken into a singles category, one 
Greek organization performing alone; and a doubles 
category, a fraternity and a sorority performing together. 
The singles performances were much more relaxed 
and fun, with the precision and professionalism of the 
doubles all showing teams who came to win. The singles 
also contained much more original content — which 
helped add to the fun atmosphere — with the doubles 
almost exclusively adapting major musicals.
Standouts from the singles category included a hilarious 
musical adaptation of the hit television show, Archer, 
titled Sterling: The Musical, which ended up taking 
third place in the singles category. Featuring ?fth-year 
chemical engineering major Jason Kelso as the too-
suave-for-his-own-good Archer, the production was 
true to the off-kilter comedic spirit of the show and was 
packed with hilarious punch lines and songs. 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s original show A Shrub’s Life, 
which ended up taking home second place in the singles 
category, was equally entertaining, with botanical 
puns galore and a laid-back attitude that made it clear 
the cast was there to have fun. The energy permeated 
the auditorium, leading to many missed jokes due to 
overwhelming laughter.
The productions of the doubles category were packed 
with all sorts of shiny bells and whistles. The months of 
work that went into Greek Sing was evident in many of 
these performances, with complex choreography ripped 
right from Broadway and intricately designed sets and 
costumes. 
Standouts from this category included Pi Kappa Alpha 
and Kappa Alpha Theta performing a Carnegie Mellon-
themed adaption of the hit 1950s musical Grease, for 
which they won second place. The production was 
incredibly engaging, with great dancing, costumes, and 
numerous Carnegie Mellon references — such as turning 
the “greased lightning” car into a buggy and a set that 
included a painted fence saying “Spring Carnival 1959” 
— that the audience loved. 
The most entertaining doubles performance, and the 
one that was awarded ?rst prize for the category, was 
Lambda Phi Epsilon and Alpha Kappa Delta Phi’s 
adaptation of the Disney musical Mulan. Featuring 
stunning costumes, a great set, energetic performances 
by all members of the cast, and most importantly, 
original jokes that were written into the script to give it 
the individual, fun spirit that many of the other doubles 
were lacking, the performance was delightful.
Greek Sing 2014 was another great installment of an 
event that raises an enormous amount of money for a 
worthy charity. It’s also a great way for many members 
of the Greek community to show off the talents that 
many wouldn’t expect them to have, such as singing 
and dancing or writing a great script. Hopefully next 
year there is a greater push for original content, for it is 
in these performances that the spirit of the event was its 
best.

Directed by the legendary Wes Anderson — whose 
works include Moonrise Kingdom, The Darjeeling 
Limited, and The Royal Tenenbaums — The Grand 
Budapest Hotel is a whimsical whirlwind through the 
adventuresome life of a concierge and his lobby boy. 
The movie is a bright and colorful spectacle set against 
the backdrop of Europe during the World Wars, which 
ensures an interesting and compelling duality to the ?lm 
and the story. 
The outrageous and sometimes hilarious plot is driven 
by its strong main characters, played by a cast that is 
fairly typical of a Wes Anderson ?lm: Gustave H (Ralph 
Fiennes), the concierge; Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori), 
his lobby boy; and a slew of eclectic and eccentric 
guests of the hotel, including characters played by 
Adrien Brody, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and 
Tilda Swinton. 
The plot follows Gustave H, his role as the main 
concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel — located in 
the ?ctional Republic of Zubrowka — and his journey 
to determine his innocence in the unfortunately-timed 
death of an elderly ex-lover, Madame D (Swinton). 
When it is discovered that Madame D has left 
Gustave a valuable painting, her family has Gustave 
imprisoned for her murder. Zero must help him ?rst 
escape, and then travel to a monastery to prove his 
innocence, all while being trailed by an assassin (Willem 
Dafoe).
Though the ?lm ends somewhat sadly and rather 
abruptly, the sense of whimsy and wonder is maintained 
through the colorful sets, costumes, and the fantastic 
acting. 
The star-studded cast serves as an added attraction 
rather than a support to carry the ?lm, and Revolori 
manages to make his major big-screen debut stand out 
even against the talented big names that accompany his 
performance. 
There is a particular brand of humor from which much 
of the ?lm draws its charm, evocative of an absurd 1930s 
madcap stage comedy. It’s vintage, but a vintage that 
is so quirky that it feels as if it could be set in a parallel 
universe. 
Anderson’s writing and production talent marries 
perfectly with the absurd storylines that he borrows from 
writer Stefan Zweig’s novels Beware of Pity and The 
Post-Of?ce Girl.
The ?lm contains many nods to Zweig’s writing and 
even Zweig himself in the character The Author, played 
in the ?lm’s present by Tom Wilkinson and in ?ashbacks 
by Law. 
Physical humor, ridiculous situations, and just enough 
drama without going completely overboard are the 
perfect blend for this cast and Anderson’s signature 
style. 
It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about Anderson’s 
?lms that is so enjoyable for audiences — most of them 
become huge box of?ce successes, despite limited 
releases. They’re quirky, unusual, and fun — but above 
all, they’re the ultimate escapist opportunity. 
The Grand Budapest Hotel is no exception: The colorful 
cast of characters, rollercoaster plot line, and unusual 
narrative structure and setup are sure to not only 
captivate viewers, but also take them along for a magical 
journey. 
The movie will show at The Manor Theatre in Squirrel 
Hill through Wednesday.

Martin Scorsese returns to make a ferocious ?lm about real-life ?gure Jordan Belfort 
and his life chock-full of debauchery and corruption while heading his brokerage

Frozen — and then imagine the exact opposite of that. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the 
performance of a lifetime as a hysterically arrogant Belfort who is on top of the world 
with his millions, his gorgeous trophy wife, and his endless supply of drugs. Despite 
the movie’s raunchiness, Scorsese and DiCaprio’s collaboration provide a ?erce rush 
of energy and comedy that places it among the best ?lms of the year.

Saving Mr. Banks
Sunday, March 30 — 2
We can all recall our childhoods being ?lled with memories of Disney ?lms — but most 
of us don’t know the struggle to bring those ?lms to the screen. After Walt Disney’s 
(Tom Hanks) daughters beg him to make an adaptation of P.L. Travers’s (Emma 
Thompson) “Mary Poppins,” he agrees to uphold his promise. When Disney reaches 
out to Travers, she is more than reluctant about selling her work into the moneymaking 
machine of Hollywood. Her stubbornness nearly derails the project and causes the 
production to stretch into 20 arduous years. Saving Mr. Banks is a captivating story 
that sheds light on the passion that both Disney and Travers had about the story of a 
magical nanny that they both wanted to share — although in completely different ways.

As of last Thursday, the eighth annual Carnegie Mellon 
International Film Festival is of?cially in full swing. 
Under this year’s theme of “Faces of Work,” the festival 
features a number of ?lms from around the globe that all 
focus on workers and, often, their struggle for a better 
life. The festival, which began last Thursday night with 
a screening of the Polish ?lm Walesa. Man of Hope and 
held its campus premiere on Friday with a screening of 
the documentary Shipbreakers, will continue through 
April 5. Most screenings will take place in McConomy 
Auditorium.
The festival’s theme is in dedication to the life and 
work of in?uential Carnegie Mellon professor Paul 
Goodman, who passed away due to a stroke in early 
2012. At Carnegie Mellon, Goodman pushed to expand 
international university projects in technological and 
environmental research, especially in developing 
countries in Asia and South America. 
According to the festival’s website, Goodman was an 
avid ?lmmaker who produced over 20 documentaries 
demonstrating “how global development and 
technological expansion are changing the nature of 
workplace demographics and methods of production” 
by highlighting the “important but often overlooked 
work of individuals such as a nurse, a factory worker, 
a glass blower, a ?sherman, and a women’s rowing 
team.” Several of his works will be screened along with 
other ?lms over the course of the festival — including 
Shipbreakers, for which Goodman posthumously won 
the Best Producer of Documentary Film Award at the 
2014 Madrid International Film Festival.
Opening night Thursday at the Regent Square Theater 
included the screening Walesa. Man of Hope, directed 
by Andrzej Wajda. The ?lm tells the true story of Lech 
Walesa, a common shipyard electrician who becomes 
embroiled in the workers’ rights movement of Poland, 
eventually becoming the leader of the Polish trade union, 
Solidarity. In this position, Walesa was able to negotiate 
signi?cant concessions for workers from the communist 
regime. Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 
1983 for his efforts and was elected the ?rst president of 
Poland following its independence in 1989. 
The world of Walesa. Man of Hope is a vivid nightmare: 
a Soviet-bloc country where the police beat and arrest 
citizens on the ?imsiest suspicion and tanks roll 
through the streets. Indeed, when Walesa leaves home, 
he often hands his wife his watch and wedding band 
and instructs her to sell them if he doesn’t come back. 
Interspersed with documentary footage of the actual 
Polish riots and demonstrations that took place over the 
course of the 1970s, the ?lm is a compelling narrative, 
focusing on Walesa as both an unlikely political leader 
— his talents for leadership coming not from books, but, 
as he says in the ?lm, from ”knowledge of Poland and 
its people” — as well as a family man who struggles to 
provide for both the monetary and emotional welfare of 
his wife, Danuta, and their six children even when he 
is being paraded through the streets as a hero. Danuta 
Walesa was in attendance at the screening.
The ?lm’s handling of Walesa’s private life occasionally 
slips into a whitewashing of the beloved ?gure — 
frequent verbal hints at the man’s dirty secrets or ill 
treatment of his wife are never explored — and the toll 
his efforts have on his family, especially Danuta, are 
given a very surface-level treatment. The depiction of 
the public Walesa, however, is where the ?lm soars. 
One can’t help but feel moved watching him lead the 
workers’ strikes. Walesa truly was a natural-born leader, 
and the ?lm perfectly captures that aspect of the man.
Before the ?lm, Danuta Walesa gave a brief introduction 
of the ?lm, in which she stated that “[the ?lm] is more 
a creation of the director than a documentary ... in 
which you will be able to see the people struggling for 
their freedom.” She also addressed what was surely 
on everyone’s mind: the obvious relation between the 
political struggle in Poland depicted in the ?lm and 
the current bloody revolution and ensuing political 
battles in another former Soviet nation, Ukraine. In a 
brief Q&A session after the ?lm, Danuta Walesa ?elded 
many questions regarding her husband’s life and legacy 
and how it has shaped many of the recent protests 
against totalitarian governments. In response to an 
audience member who asked if there was a moment 
that she realized the Solidarity movement was big, she 
responded that she was “only just coming to realize” 
how big it was.
The festival’s campus opening night on Friday featured 
a screening of the documentary Shipbreakers, directed 
by Ralph Vituccio, an instructor in the Entertainment 
Technology Center, and produced by Paul Goodman. 
The ?lm focuses on Indian migrant workers who 
dismantle decommissioned ships along the beaches 
of Alang, highlighting the terrible conditions in which 
the impoverished men perform this dangerous job. A 
panel discussion was held afterward with Vituccio, 
Shipbreakers cinematographer Tom Clancey, Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette assistant managing editor Mark Roth, and 
University of Pittsburgh professor of political science 
Michael Goodhart. University of Pittsburgh professor of 
global studies Roger Rouse served as moderator.
Keeping with the festival’s theme, Shipbreakers details 
an industry that requires virtually no electric power, but 
runs almost exclusively on manual labor. Much of the 
work is performed using brute force — there are many 
instances of a hammer and chisel being put to work 
against steel and iron — and the lax enforcement of 
workers’ rights and environmental regulations makes the 
occupation a virtual death 
sentence.

While Alang is not the only site of this industry, virtually 
all privately-owned ships are dismantled in similar 
shipyards in developing countries such as Bangladesh 
and Pakistan.
During the panel, Vituccio said that “many workers were 
reluctant to talk to us” due to the risks involved with 
publicly denouncing the shipyards. Therefore, he said, 
each worker who did speak had “incredible courage” 
in basically putting his life on the line by speaking to 
“people he’d never see again.”
The stories these workers tell are harrowing, to say the 
least. Among tales of men being crushed to death by 
falling steel, many of the workers complain of the smoke 
they are forced to breathe due to the lack of proper 
masks. Workers are largely unaware of the kinds of 
toxins to which they are exposed — many of them have 
been outlawed since the 1970s, but are still present in 
the ships being dismantled. Interviews with workers and 
managers reveal a large disparity in how the situation 
is viewed. One shipyard manager even insisted that 
because there were trees growing outside his of?ce, that 
meant there was no environmental problems. “Greenery 
means no pollution,” is how he put it. 
The conditions in Alang are contrasted with the same 
industry being performed in Brownsville, Texas, where 
Mexican migrant workers dismantle U.S. government-
owned ships according to strict environmental and 
safety standards. A chilling visual compared the workers 
in India wearing a simple cloth tied around their faces 
while workers in Texas performed the same task wearing 
a complete Hazmat suit and mask. 
While the ?lm made a good case that the practice of ship 
recycling should follow the strict regulations 
followed in the United States, 
Clancey 
pointed 
out in the 
panel that the wages paid were “high for Mexico, but 
are extremely low by U.S. standards.” He also mentioned 
that ships are only dismantled in such a highly regulated 
fashion in Texas because they are owned by the U.S. 
government and, therefore, have to be dismantled 
in that manner according to EPA regulations. They 
are forbidden from being sold to private shipyards in 
developing countries.
The two ?lms featured in the opening of “Faces of Work” 
are signs of good things to come in the festival. One 
thing is certain: Both ?lms leave one with a greater 
appreciation of working conditions in the United States. 
After witnessing men beaten to within inches of death 
for protesting for their right to collective bargaining, or a 
man working nearly 20-hour days breathing in hazardous 
chemicals, recent protests over the wages of McDonald’s 
workers certainly lose some ?re. While certainly present, 
this effect, however, isn’t the point of “Faces of Work.” 
Indeed, many Americans were in similar situations 
during our own Industrial Revolution. As Vituccio 
explained in his introduction to Shipbreakers, the goal 
of the ?lm was to “focus on the burden of the common 
worker,” whether that be a dockyard worker in China 
or a gas station attendant in New Jersey. The ?lms of 
“Faces of Work” demonstrate the past, present, and 
future struggles of men and women all around the world; 
celebrating their successes as well as mourning the

“A long time ago/We used to be friends/But I haven’t 
thought of you lately at all.”
Never has the theme song to Veronica Mars ?t so 
well. On March 14, after seven years of waiting, the 
short-lived TV series made the leap to the silver 
screen.
After years of movie rumors ?oating around, creator 
Rob Thomas and much of the main cast announced 
a Kickstarter campaign to raise $2 million — the 
minimum needed to make the ?lm.
They reached that goal within 10 hours and almost 
tripled it in the 31 days the campaign ran. Over 
91,000 people donated a total of $5.7 million to see 
this movie made. The question now is whether or 
not it is a success.
The movie picks up nine years after the series ?nale. 
Veronica (Kristen Bell) has graduated from law 
school and is on her way to becoming a lawyer in a 
prestigious New York law ?rm. She hasn’t worked 
a case since she transferred to Stanford University 
and left the town of Neptune, California, but that 
changes when pop star Bonnie DeVille (Andrea 
Estella) is murdered.
Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), both Bonnie and 
Veronica’s ex-boyfriend, is the number one suspect. 
Veronica heads back to Neptune to help her former 
love ?nd a lawyer, but stays to help clear his name 
and solve the case.
There is no doubt that this movie is a love story 
to the fans. Even minor characters from the series 
make an appearance, like friendly stoner Corny 
(Jonathan Chesner) and another of Veronica’s exes, 
Leo D’Amato (Max Green?eld).
The main characters that are present are more 
mature, but still have the personalities of their 
younger selves. Most characters’ careers aren’t 
really a surprise: High school basketball star Wallace 
Fennel (Percy Daggs III) is now a basketball coach, 
while computer hacker Mac (Tina Majorino) is 
working for a tech company.
Logan’s career, however, is a surprise and is best 
kept secret until you see the movie.
Jokes and references abound, from mentions of 
marshmallows, the affectionate nicknames for fans, 
to a reference to Veronica working for the FBI, a 
shout-out to the last-ditch effort by Thomas for a 
renewal.
In terms of story, though, the movie was a little 
weak. While it was nice to see old faces brought 
into the story, the sheer coincidence of all these 
people being connected in some way to this case is 
unbelievable.
The background story of Neptune’s widespread 
police corruption was interesting, but the inclusion 
of Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), the mother of one of 
Veronica’s exes, for only a brief moment in a pivotal 
scene was a stretch that felt more like an excuse to 
have her there than actual plot development.
That being said, Veronica Mars is a wildly 
entertaining movie — for fans. Non-fans might 
?nd it interesting, but it’s so bogged down in show 
references and character history that they might ?nd 
themselves completely out of the loop.
The recap at the beginning of the movie gives a 
good brief overview of the series as a whole, but it’s 
hard to encompass three seasons of mysteries into 
two minutes.
One of the best things about the movie, besides 
the fact that it’s Veronica Mars, is the usage of 
real-life celebrities in cameos. The show was set 
in southern California, but never had the clout to 
bring in any bigger names. The movie makes good 
use of the stars’ connections, with appearances by 
Justin Long, Bell’s husband Dax Shepard, and James 
Franco.
Bottom line: Fans of the series will love it. It’s 
everything you loved about the show: witty, smart, 
and heartfelt; there’s just more of it.

What’s New? 
Housing changes for the 2014 room selection process
New upperclassmen housing: 624 Clyde
Located across from Shady Oak apartments at 624 Clyde St., the new 624 Clyde 
house will contain 28–34 apartments for off-campus living. Unlike other off-campus 
residences, 624 Clyde will house students “with a global curiosity,” according to the 
application — students “who are committed to deepening their own intercultural 
competency, and who have an interest in developing a mutual understanding of their 
responsibilities to be active global citizens seeking to bring change to the world they 
can influence.” The building will have a kitchen, study lounge, and three common 
rooms.
CPDC replaces rooms on West Wing 2nd Floor
Students will be unable to apply for housing for the second floor of West Wing because 
the space will soon hold the new Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC), 
which currently resides in the basement of the University Center. Likewise, students 
who currently live on the second floor of West Wing will have to move elsewhere for the 
fall semester, but will be given priority during Room Selection.
Morewood Gardens to offer block housing
This fall, Morewood Gardens will join off-campus locations in offering block housing for 
upperclassmen. For block housing, six to 12 students choose a “block” of apartments 
or rooms next to each other so that they may be in close contact. This option is popu-
lar for first-year students who enjoyed living with the people on their dorm floor, or for 
those who want to have better access to their closest friends. Other dorms that offer 
block housing include Webster, Fairfax, Neville, Shady Oak, and Shirley Apartments.
Fairfax Apartments not offering certain rooms
Rooms 218, 219, 319, 419, 519, 618, 619, 718, 719, 810, 819, and 919 will be unavailable 
as living spaces for the 2014–15 academic year, due to a need for “ongoing mainte-
nance,” according to Housing and Dining Services. Students currently in these rooms 
will be given priority during room selection.
3

---------------------------------------------------

Room retention
Room retention, the first phase, is for students planning to retain their current room for 
the next school year. Although there are some exceptions, room retention is available 
to most upperclass students, except those in special-interest housing, a first-year 
dormitory, or an RA/CA room. First-year students are not eligible to retain their rooms, 
regardless of their room location. Students considering room retention should remember 
that once they retain, they cannot change or cancel their housing assignment until the 
open cancellation period begins.
Room with a retainer
Students retaining their rooms during the first phase are required to fill any vacancies 
in the room, suite, or apartment with “pull-ins.” In order to be “pulled in” to a room, 
students must be eligible to participate in room selection and must not have already 
selected an assignment for the school year.
General room selection
General room selection is the final phase of room selection. During this phase, students 
eligible for housing who haven’t participated in the preceding phases choose a room 
from the remaining spaces. Students planning to participate in general room selection 
must apply online. They are then given a random room selection timeslot.
RA/CA housing
RA/CA housing is only available for those students holding an RA or CA position during 
the 2014–15 school year. These students will not be eligible to participate in room 
selection, and will instead be assigned a room through the application and selection 
process carried out by the Office of Student Life.
Special-interest housing
Special-interest housing allows groups of students to apply for group housing centered 
around a certain interest or theme. Special-interest housing groups should consider 
how they plan to positively impact the larger residential community before completing 
the special-interest housing application process.
Block housing
The block housing phase of room selection allows groups of students to select a “block” 
of rooms near each other in one of the applicable dormitories. Students electing to 
apply for block housing must identify a group representative who will be responsible 
for setting up their block housing group on the housing application and will remain the 
main contact point between the group and Housing Services.
Gender-neutral housing
Gender-neutral housing, available in the Oakland Community Apartments, permits 
upperclass residents of different genders to reside in the same room.
Open assignments
Due to fluctuating availability in room assignments, some students are given an 
open assignment. This means that while they are guaranteed a room for the 2014–15 
academic year, they will not immediately know where that room will be located, or 
what style of room they will be assigned. After receiving an open assignment, students 
wait until they receive an offer for a room for the upcoming year. After receiving their 
offer, they can decline the offer and cancel their housing agreement within three days 
without penalty, even if the offer was made after the open cancellation period ends.

www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection.

Room selection phases explained
Terms and technicalities to guide you through the process
Room selection offers students several options: room retention, room with a retainer (also known as a “pull-in”), general room selection, 
RA/CA housing, special-interest housing, block housing, gender-neutral housing, and open assignments.
Most students will participate in one of three room selection choices: room retention, room with a retainer, or general room selection. 
However, a wide variety of housing options is available to all students. Room selection begins on March 6, so all students returning next 
year should begin thinking about their housing plans for the 2014–15 school year.

FAIRFAX APARTMENTS
Located close to campus facilities, Doherty Apartments is a good option for on-
campus housing. It is a three-minute walk to the Resnik Café and 10 minutes from 
most classes. Doherty is a solid option for students who wish to have their own 
kitchen in an autonomous apartment style of living.
Doherty is divided into four separate towers, each headed by its own RA, who 
provides his or her residents with essentials: trash bags, paper towels, and, of 
course, toilet paper. Each tower consists of three ?oors and a basement.
As a community, there are weekly events to satisfy your sweet tooth and appropriate 
exercise programs to sweat off the day’s regret. However, due primarily to the tower 
layout of the building, making friends in Doherty can be more dif?cult than in other 
housing options. 
Doherty Apartments provides air conditioning only in its exercise room. However, the 
heating system was upgraded recently.
The rooms provide a mix of privacy and integration with roommates. The one-
bedroom triples include a bedroom for the three beds, a bathroom, and a living room 
with a kitchenette. The living room also has three study desks, a dining table, a couch, 
and a small loveseat. Two-person ef?ciencies are similar, though everything is located 
in a single room without some of the furniture.
In general, Doherty Apartments provides a decently-sized living area for those who 
seek autonomy in college life.
The Fairfax Apartments are an excellent transition for upperclassmen to living in 
off-campus housing. Once acquainted with back-alley shortcuts, it’s a quick 10-to-15-
minute walk to campus, and the building’s proximity to S. Craig Street, which houses 
many restaurants that are open late at night, make it appealing to many college 
students. 
Inside the individual apartments, every room is carpeted, except for the kitchen and 
bathroom, which have tiling. The walls, conveniently, are solid — a welcome change 
from the paper-thin dividers that separate rooms in some on-campus housing. Fairfax 
is also relatively quiet, although every now and then, a group of happy, shouting 
people may break the silence. The rooms are furnished and come prepared with 
beds, tables, and drawers. The kitchen has a stove and refrigerator. Some units even 
have dishwashers. Air-conditioning and heating are included, as well.
Bus stops for the 54C, 71 series, and 75 are also located close to the building’s 
doors. 
Laundry payment may be the largest problem students have with Fairfax. Doing 
laundry requires that students ?rst buy a $5 card to pay for the machines. The card 
does not actually come with $5; students must input money manually, and the 
machine accepts only bills. 
In addition, Fairfax’s Internet connection uses Comcast rather than Carnegie Mellon’s 
Internet. Finally, the cost of living is one of the highest at Carnegie Mellon, but 
Fairfax’s amenities and its location may justify some of those expenses.

McGILL HOUSE
McGill, Carnegie Mellon’s only all-female dorm, offers residents prime doubles and 
singles arranged into suites. Each suite connects two doubles, or two doubles and 
one single. Rooms in McGill are small, so residents are often forced to loft their 
beds. However, the size of the rooms is offset by the convenience of semiprivate 
bathrooms in each suite.
McGill may be one of the smaller dorms, but residents’ social lives are certainly not 
limited. McGill offers a friendly environment, especially since residents can socialize 
in any of the individual ?oor lounges or in the large ?rst-?oor television room and 
study area. 
Weekly events bring together residents from both Boss and McGill and offer a 
reliable dose of fun and entertainment. Also, if residents tire of their own building, 
they are just a few steps away from other Hill residences.
McGill’s location on Margaret Morrison Street, like the other Hill residences, 
make it exceptionally convenient to a number of locations. Residents can catch 
art exhibitions, shows, and events at The Frame, Carnegie Mellon’s student-run art 
gallery on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Margaret Morrison Street.
 A short walk across the street, residents can take advantage of the nearby campus 
dining locations, including Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie Mellon Café, and the Zebra 
Lounge. When campus food gets too monotonous, the food trucks parked nearby 
offer a great alternative to on-campus dining.
Margaret Morrison Apartments, located on the Hill, offers residents on-campus 
apartments. Each unit has two ?oors, with a lounge and kitchen on the ?rst ?oor and 
bedrooms and bathrooms either up or down a ?oor, depending on the apartment. All 
of the “Maggie Mo” apartments were redone in 2007, when they were re?tted with 
new furniture, appliances, and countertops.
The bedrooms are some of the biggest that you will ?nd on campus. Each apartment 
has a kitchen, which is nice for upperclassmen tired of campus food.
Additionally, each of the apartment units is separate from the others.
Residents also have access to laundry and exercise facilities, which are on the street 
level of Margaret Morrison Street.
Starting next academic year, Margaret Morrison appartments 131 and 132 will be a 
16-person “Sustainability House” which is accepting applications for residents.
Although the common areas may be a bit tight, “Maggie Mo” can offer residents the 
chance to have independence while still living on campus.

NEVILLE APARTMENTS
While students of most residences have to pull on their shoes and head to campus 
to ?nd a hot meal or a working printer, Morewood Gardens residents need not leave 
the premises. Fully equipped with a computer cluster, a source of convenient (albeit 
greasy) food at The Underground, large laundry rooms, and a gym, this dorm is 
completely self-suf?cient. And what’s more, it’s smack at the corner of Morewood 
and Forbes Avenues, only a couple of steps away from campus.
The dorm’s proximity to campus gives it a signi?cant edge over other residential 
areas. This factor maximizes your sleep time before early classes and also allows you 
to sprint back for your homework when you realize you’ve left it in your room. 
While both Stever and Mudge houses are located on Morewood Avenue, they 
normally house only ?rst-year students, making Morewood the only choice for older 
students who want to live in this area.
Morewood’s plentiful lounges, including a few on each ?oor in addition to the larger 
study rooms and TV lounge on the ?rst ?oor, allow for frequent group gatherings. 
While this is a positive attribute for more social students, it means that several rooms 
on each ?oor are likely to experience frequent noise disturbances throughout the day 
and night.
When choosing a room in Morewood, it’s hit-or-miss. Some rooms are spacious and 
quiet, while others are small and loud. It’s the luck of the draw, and sometimes you 
lose. Try to plan out which rooms look best from the ?oor plans online, and try to visit 
a room before committing. This will give you a good idea of what you’re getting.
Morewood Gardens could be a great place to live, but before deciding to move in, 
check out the rooms ahead of time and ask the current residents about the noise 
situation, as some rooms are better than others.
The Neville Apartments are a living community through the Carnegie Mellon housing 
system, comprised of eight apartments that feature a mix of double and single 
bedrooms. Previously a co-op, Neville is now a traditional apartment living situation.
Neville apartments contains fully furnished bedrooms and living spaces, with each 
of the four apartments containing two bathrooms. Additionally, each apartment has 
a mix of single and double rooms, as well as two kitchens containing a stove and 
refrigerator. The basement contains laundry facilities and a student lounge, and 
students will have to purchase their Internet service from Comcast.
This switch back to apartment-styled housing is a new shift, as Neville had been 
run as a housing co-op since 2003. The co-op was created based on the tenets of 
sustainability and environmental awareness, activism, and equality in race, gender, 
and sexuality.
Residents who had applied for admission were encouraged to participate in various 
events hosted by the current members of the co-op during the room selection period. 
Neville Apartments will not be application-based housing, but can be selected 
through the standard university housing selection process.
During its time as a co-op, Neville had no RAs, instead using liaisons to the Housing 
and Student Life of?ces who would help the co-op solve housing problems. However, 
with the transition to apartments, this is unlikely to remain the case, as current 
Carnegie Mellon-af?liated apartments make use of the RA system.
What kind of community Neville will have after its co-op days will have to be seen, 
but the building and space will remain the same as it was.

SHADY OAK APARTMENTS
Shady Oak, located on Clyde Street, contains apartments each boast a full kitchen 
complete with an electric stove and oven, as well as a dishwasher. The layouts vary 
greatly from apartment to apartment, with some having single bedrooms and no 
common living space, others having shared bedrooms with spacious living rooms, 
and others having a combination of the two. 
There is a lounge in the basement with numerous couches and a big-screen TV; this 
space is commonly used for watching sporting events and hosting study groups. 
Basic gym equipment is also located in the basement. For students who want to 
keep an active lifestyle and don’t get enough of a workout from the 10-minute walk to 
campus, there are multiple treadmills, an elliptical trainer, and a weight-lifting station. 
The basement is also home to four washers and four dryers — not on the campus 
laundry network and accepting only quarters — and a large table for folding laundry.
Venture outside to ?nd a picnic table and charcoal grill that is always available. The 
backyard is large enough to play a game of Frisbee or football with friends. Across the 
street, there is a bus stop for the 71C, which can be taken to Downtown to watch a 
show or to East Liberty for a date at Target.
There are some drawbacks to living in Shady Oak. The plumbing has a tendency 
to malfunction, sometimes causing pipes to burst, leading to water shut-offs. The 
radiators have also been a cause for concern: They are set on a building-wide timer 
that can sometimes shut off in the middle of the night or be set on full blast on 
warmer days.
The Roselawn Terrace houses, located off Margaret Morrison Street, are some of the 
most sought-after housing options on campus. Roselawn is located on the edge of 
campus, providing students with a feeling of independence while still only having to 
walk less than 10 minutes to get to class. 
Each house, divided into a single-occupancy room and two double-occupancy rooms, 
holds ?ve students. The bedrooms are quite small — so small, in fact, that one of the 
doubles can’t hold both residents’ desks. The upside to this is that the living area on 
the ?rst ?oor is spacious.
Living rooms have hardwood ?oors and comfortable furniture. Each dining room has 
a large table that seats six by a wall of windows. Kitchens have been completely 
re?nished with new cabinets and appliances. All the walls in the houses have been 
given a fresh coat of paint with vibrant accent colors.
One downside to the Roselawn houses is that residents no longer have access to 
the basement, cutting down on the storage space previously offered. The rooms also 
have closets that tend to be too small for most people’s wardrobes. 
In addition to the large living spaces offered in Roselawn, residents have access to 
the Margaret Morrison lounge and exercise room. All Roselawn residents are also 
on the campus laundry network, getting free laundry and access to laundromat-style 
dryers.
Another good thing about Roselawn houses is that, while there is more than enough 
living space, the cost of living in the house is less than the cost of living in some 
Oakland apartments.
Roselawn houses offer the feeling of living on your own, while still providing 
residents with the amenities and assistance of campus housing. If you don’t care 
about the size of your bedroom, Roselawn is the place to live.

WELCH HOUSE/HENDERSON HOUSE
Webster Hall, located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and North Dithridge Street, is a 
popular off-campus residence offered by Carnegie Mellon. Webster is located in the 
heart of Oakland, about a 10-minute walk from campus. One of the ?rst stops on the 
Carnegie Mellon shuttle line, Webster offers easy access to the numerous restaurants, 
cafés, convenience stores, and shops located in the Oakland area.
Carnegie Mellon rents out one-bedroom apartments to two students, and two-
bedroom apartments to three students. The apartments are spacious and offer 
many bene?ts that dorm rooms do not, including a fully-furnished living room, two 
bathrooms, and a kitchen. For many students, this escape from typical dorm life is the 
basis of Webster’s appeal.
In addition to the spacious apartments, students also bene?t from the facilities 
offered by Webster. The building contains a gym, a homestyle deli, and even an in-
house hair and waxing salon. Additionally, each ?oor has a trash-disposal facility and a 
laundry room.
There are, however, some small disadvantages. The laundry facilities can become a 
hassle for many residents. Using the facilities can become expensive, with a cost of 
$2.50 to wash and dry one load of clothes. The dryers on most ?oors are not fully 
functional, often requiring two full runs to completely dry clothes. For many students, 
this is one of the biggest complaints about Webster.
An additional point for consideration is the price. Renting apartments in Webster can 
be costly, but like Fairfax Apartments, its location and amenities may justify the price.
 
Shirley Apartments, located next door to Webster Hall, contains a ?oor plan similar 
to Webster’s ?oor plan. Each apartment has a bedroom, a living area, and a kitchen, 
while the ef?ciencies are essentially rooms with a bathroom and a kitchen. One 
downside of Shirley, however, is that it is one of the farthest living spaces from 
campus. 
As one of the more recently renovated student dorms on campus, Henderson House 
is a clean and quiet place to live. This dorm offers students air conditioning and 
heating, connected bathrooms — which are cleaned once a week — shared with one 
other room, and the intimacy of a small building, with 20 rooms per ?oor. The ?rst 
?oor is generally reserved for ?rst-years only. 
Accepting residents by application only, Henderson along with McGill are considered 
“Wellness Houses,” because they promote green practices, maintain a substance-
free lifestyle, and generally encourage healthy living. Each student who lives here is 
expected to sign an agreement promising to adhere to these standards during the 
school year. Students can also take advantage of playing for the house’s intramural 
teams or participating in weekly optional community activities set up by the resident 
assistants. Tickets to special events like plays or shows are subsidized by the dorm, 
which is a nice perk. 
Henderson, although placed on the outskirts of Carnegie Mellon, is sheltered from 
any traf?c or noise from campus. The dorm’s residents also respect an unwritten 
policy of peace and quiet, which makes this dorm ideal for studying. 
Despite all Henderson has to offer students, there are drawbacks. Dorm rooms are 
not the largest, and on occasion the heating will malfunction, overheating many of 
the rooms.
 
Welch is one of the Hill houses, but it distinguishes itself by having a 24-hour quiet 
rule. This often means that Welch attracts students who prefer to keep to themselves 
and are less interested in creating a community atmosphere. However, the 
atmosphere seems to suit students who want a comfortable home and don’t want to 
be distracted by noise. The rooms are large and bathrooms are spacious.

WOODLAWN  APARTMENTS
Woodlawn Apartments may be one of the older housing options on campus, but it is 
convenient for walking to class, and it’s right on the Forbes Avenue bus routes that 
can take you anywhere else that you’d like to go.
The bedrooms and living rooms both boast plenty of space, a de?nite upgrade for 
those used to sharing cramped quarters. Some rooms have hardwood ?oors; others 
have thin carpeting. The building will be undergoing renovations this summer to 
upgrade the wiring and ?xtures in addition to installing brand-new bathrooms.
Several times per semester, The Frame art gallery, which is housed in the ?rst ?oor of 
the apartment building, has loud parties that can be heard throughout the building. 
Woodlawn Apartments is great if you want to live with a big group of friends, since 
each apartment houses a lot of people. Woodlawn is also a good choice if you want a 
small community and are looking to live in an apartment on campus.
Resnik and West Wing are the ideal dormitory choices for students who aren’t ready 
— or aren’t willing — to move off campus but want a bit more of a grown-up place 
to live in than a typical dorm. While students in these dorms have the chance to be 
more independent, they also boast a quick walk to any of the academic buildings on 
campus, a de?nite bene?t for those mornings when you just can’t stop hitting the 
snooze button.
Both dorms consist primarily of suites, which are made up of two doubles and a 
single with a common bathroom and lounge for the suite. A limited number of prime 
singles and doubles do exist in the buildings as well, though they are not as well 
known.
Resnik and West Wing are optimal for a group of friends who wish to live together 
but want to maintain their proximity to campus and the other advantages — like free 
toilet paper and a once-a-week bathroom cleaning — that living on campus offers. 
Students mostly stay inside their suites, leaving the hallways relatively quiet. The 
lounges do ?ll up, however — usually with groups of students either working on 
homework or playing video games.
Both buildings offer kitchens on certain ?oors, which is nice when you’ve had your ?ll 
of The Exchange and El Gallo de Oro. If you don’t feel like cooking, Resnik is home to 
a number of dining options. There is the Tartans Pavilion, the Carnegie Mellon Café, 
and Resnik Café. In particular, Resnik Café offers a variety of choices, including sushi, 
Indian cuisine, and comfort foods, among others.
With the numerous amenities that Resnik and West Wing offer, it is not surprising 
that both of these dorms ?ll up early in the room selection process. Hopeful residents 
are advised to ?nd a friend who can pull them in.

Just a 10-to-15-minute walk (or ?ve-minute bus ride) from campus lies the neighborhood of Oakland, 
the home of late-night food, University of Pittsburgh pride, and a population made up almost entirely of 
college students. Oakland is home to some of Carnegie Mellon students’ favorite restaurants, including 
Con?ict Kitchen, Chipotle, Fuel and Fuddle, and The Porch. For students over 21, Oakland has a solid 
group of late-night destinations, such as local bars like Hemingway’s, Mad Mex with its margaritas, and 
a liquor store with an extensive selection, all within walking distance from each other. Another bene?t of 
Oakland is its availability of affordable housing close to campus. Oakland Avenue and Atwood Avenue 
are lined with housing for both Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students.
Most people living here are always up for fun; if you’re looking for a quiet neighborhood, Oakland may 
not be your cup of tea. Starting on Thursday nights — the start of the weekend for Pitt students — the 
neighborhood bustles, ?lled with groups of college kids out to have a good time. Oakland should be 
noted for its lively atmosphere and is ideal for anyone looking for an extended weekend and college-
oriented surroundings.
OAKLAND
Shadyside is home to upperclassmen from Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, 
graduate students, and young working professionals. Accessible by Pittsburgh buses, it tends 
to be slightly pricier than Oakland or Squirrel Hill; however, it is the most charming of the areas 
surrounding campus, with its tree-lined streets and boutiques. The neighborhood is best known 
for two things: shops and bars. Walnut Street is lined with a wide variety of shops, from small 
boutiques to Apple, J. Crew, Ann Taylor, and Banana Republic. Cozy restaurants like the Walnut 
Grill are interspersed among the shops.
Just blocks from the restaurants are Shadyside’s bars. William Penn Tavern and Shady Grove 
are the most popular, known by Carnegie Mellon students as the closest bar locations outside of 
Panther Hollow Inn. William Penn Tavern in particular gathers a large number of Carnegie Mellon 
students. On Tuesdays and Sundays, William Penn Tavern is open to all ages for its wing nights, 
where customers can get 10 wings in a variety of ?avors, from traditional BBQ to the ?avor mix of 
“the kitchen sink,” for a great price.
While the area near these bars can be particularly loud from Thursday to Sunday, Shadyside is 
generally a very relaxed, quiet area. The young professionals and the college students who live 
there are diverse  — from artists to technical majors to medical students. Shadyside is a great 
area for anyone looking for either an escape from campus or a popular shopping and nightlife 
experience.

Just up the big hill on Forbes Avenue is the start of Squirrel Hill. It 
is either a 20-minute walk or a three-minute bus ride from campus, 
and the buses are very frequent — all of the 61 buses serve the 
route. The cost of living in Squirrel Hill is higher than in Oakland, 
but lower than in Shadyside. Furthermore, Squirrel Hill is the 
most residential of all the areas surrounding campus. In addition 
to housing upperclass students from Carnegie Mellon, it is also 
home to faculty and Pittsburgh families not associated with the 
university. Most Carnegie Mellon students know the neighborhood 
for its restaurants and Giant Eagle. Squirrel Hill has a vast diversity 
of restaurants, from Thai food at Silk Elephant to Mediterranean 
food at Mediterranean Grill to the waf?es at Waffallonia. The 
restaurants are dispersed among small shops, including those on 
the main thoroughfare of Forbes Avenue.
On Murray Avenue, just off of Forbes, Giant Eagle is the perfect 
one-stop shop for all of your food shopping necessities. Squirrel Hill 
is relatively quiet, with most noise coming from traf?c on Forbes 
and Murray Avenues. It is not a college neighborhood like Oakland 
and Shadyside, and it does not have a prominent bar scene. It does 
have a residential atmosphere, however, that the other two areas 
lack. 
For someone looking for a short ride or walk from campus with 
all the necessities within walking distance and a wide variety of 
cuisines, Squirrel Hill may be the right place to look for a home to 
rent.
