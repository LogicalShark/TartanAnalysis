SOCIAL EDUCATION:
For the young man or woman 
entering Society good dancing is 
indispensable.
The grace and elegance of the 
finished dancer with correct ball­
room manners, deportment and so­
cial etiquette, can be learnt only 
at a high class school where taught 
and practiced.
McDougall’s new $50,000 school, 
at 4614-16 Forbes—4 doors East of 
Craig — is the only institution 
in Pittsburgh where these accom­
plishments receive particular at­
tention.

WEST VIRGINIA GAME
We were defeated last Saturday by West Virginia; 
but the game ended with the team still playing foot­
ball. The newspapers seem to consider the game a 
good one from the spectators point, as there were 
several long runs and forward passes. The chief 
thing that we can say about our forward passes is 
that they didn’t work as well as West Virginia’s did. 
Our opponents, however, did not have to rely on 
forward passes as their heavy line and equally heavy 
and speedy backs could gain them the required dis­
tances without forward passes.
Hittner was undoubtedly our star and he is im­
proving every game. Marshall and Ramp both 
played good, consistent games and Ramp made sev­
eral gains with the ball. All four guards and tackles 
gathered a few penalties to themselves for holding 
in the line and offside play.
Nebinger and Diffendal were the reliables for West 
Virginia.
The band was out in force and the showing they 
made was certainly creditable. The rooting was the 
best this season; but there is still room for improve­
ment.
Game in Detail.
Brown for Tech kicked to Nebinger on West Vir­
ginia’s 15-yard line. Nebinger returned it 20 yards 
before he was downed by Hittner. Yount made 
three yards and Nebinger, after a no gain, kicked 
to Brown. Brown made the sign for a fair catch, 
but was tackled and West Virginia was penalized 
15 yards. Schmucker, on a trial at left end, failed 
to gain. Brown did the same, whereupon Frampton 
punted 20 yards to Shelton, who was downed in his 
tracks by Patterson. Nebinger, for West Virginia, 
made five yards at left. Yount failed to gain and
Nebinger punted to Brown, who fumbled, but re­
covered the ball. Hittner got 15 yards around right 
end. On the onside kick it was West Virginia’s ball 
in the center of the field.
Nebinger got three yards at left guard, and on a 
15 yards forward pass to Hinerman, Hinerman was 
downed in his tracks by Hittner. Nebinger made 
20 yards at left guard. Tech penalized for holding 
in the line. On the next try Diffendall fumbled and 
Frampton punted 30 yards out of danger. Diffendall 
got 10 yards at left guard and Nebinger eight more 
at right tackle.
Roura now took the place of Schmucker. On a 
forward pass of ten yards Shelton to Nebinger the 
latter made the first touchdown. Score, West Vir­
ginia 5, Tech 0. Nebinger failed at goal. Brown 
now kicked to Nebinger on the 5-yard line. West 
Virginia kicked on second down to Hittner, who re­
turned it 20 yards before he was downed by Shelton.
Shelton was hurt, but continued in the game. 
Hittner for Tech got four yards at right end. Tech 
penalized ten yards for offside. West Virginia’s ball 
in center of field. Halferty takes Beeken's place at 
right end. Diffendall made three yards for a touch- 
dowTn. Nebinger kicked goal. Score: West Virginia
11, Tech 0.
Brown kicked to Diffendall, who returned it 18 
yards before he was finally downed by Hittner. West 
Virginia's ball on 30-yard line. Young got 25 yards 
at left end. Tech’s ball on failure of forwrard pass. 
Tech lost ball on downs and on an onside kick by 
West Virginia. Hittner obtained and ran the ball 
for a brilliant dash of 20 yards.
Hinerman hurt. Hittner got 20 yards at left end 
and Ramp five yards at right tackle, when Tech was

penalized 15 yards for holding in the line. Tech 
punted 25 yards and Young, for West Virginia, made 
seven yards at right end.
Tech Penalized.
On forward pass Tech’s ball. Tech again penal­
ized 15 yards for holding West Virginia’s ball on 
four-yard line. Fumble by West Virginia. Tech 
punted from behind the goal posts to Shelton, who 
was downed in his tracks. Remainder of half was a 
see-saw, with West Virginia’s ball in center of field 
when play ended.
At the start of the second half Roe was substi­
tuted for Frampton. West Virginia kicked off to 
Tech and on two trials Tech failed to gain. Hittner 
punting to Nebinger, who fumbled. Tech on the 
first down was penalized 15 yards for offside. West 
Virginia’s ball on 40-yard line.
Nebinger lost five yards at right tackle. On a 
forward pass, Shelton to Nebinger, 15 yards were 
added. Ball on Tech’s 20-yard line. Tech’s ball on 
penalty on own 25-yard line. On three atteijpts by 
Ramp but eight yards were netted and it was West 
Virginia’s ball on 35-yard line. Shelton lost five 
yards, and on a quarter back kick by Shelton, Hitt­
ner seized the ball and ran 35 yards before he was 
downed. On a forward pass, Hittner to Halferty, a 
gain was made of 20 yards, but Brown on the next 
attempt lost seven yards and Hittner punted to 
Nebinger.
After a 25-yard kick by Hittner, West Virginia 
worked the ball to Tech's 10-yard line and Hutchin­
son was pushed over for a touchdown. Score, West 
Virginia 1G, Tech 0. Nebinger failed at goal. The 
remainder of the game was incessant bucking of 
the line on the part of West Virginia and the work­
ing by Tech of West Virginia's left end with poor 
results, at times succeeded by flashing runs.

A SEASONABLE RHYME.
The oyster down in his bed of ooze
Waked with a start from his summer snooze,
Opened his shell and said with a yawn,
“I fear that our summer of safety is gone;
For my pleasant dreams were disturbed by the jar 
That is always caused by the letter R,
And I know by the keel of that hideous sloop 
That some of us shortly will be in the soup!”
RUBBER RECLAMATION.
Address Delivered Before Crucible Club by Prof. 
J. H. James, Ph.D.
Fellow members of the Crucible Club:
I did not know when I came here tonight that I 
was the only speaker to be here. As I have an elas­
tic subject it will take my time in explaining it. 
The chief topic of my talk tonight will be the ex­
plaining of a new rubber reclaiming process, which 
was brought to my attention some months ago, and
1 have been making experiments with a view of 
introducing it into this country. You all know the 
many uses of rubber that gave it its value. It is 
one of the few substances in the world that will 
stretch about ten times its own length. Rubber is 
a hydrocarbon and belongs to the turpine series. 
The turpine hydrocarbons differ from the benzine 
series. About all we know of the rubber molecule 
itself is that its ultimate formula is C*0 Hio. It is 
believed, that when a solvent dissolves rubber like 
benzine, the solvent does not dissolve the rubber, 
but the so-called solvent is dissolved by the rubber. 
A solution of rubber has no definite composition. I 
will now speak a little about the natural history of 
rubber. It comes from the juices of the inner bark 
of a great many trees. The best rubber is the Para 
rubber and come from Brazil. Rubbers differ from 
each other in composition. They all contain caou- 
chouc owing to a mixture of carbon with different 
rosins. Rosins ai*e a very deleterious matter in rub­
ber. Rubber is bought and sold in the market like 
steel. In fact, the large rubber factories are begin­
ning to hire chemits to buy their rubber. Para rub­
ber has sold at $1.60 per pound. It now costs about 
$1.20 to $1.30. Rubber is not sold to the manufact­
urers on a scientific basis. The buying of rubber 
is done simply by tasting, smelling and weighing. 
The gathering of rubber is a very interesting story. 
The tree is tapped by making an incision in the bark 
and catching the juice in buckets. The juice is some­
thing like the juice from a milk weed. The natives 
travel through the forests where the atmosphere 
is laden with fever germs and climate very severe. 
The increase in demand, wrhich has been brought 
about by the invention of automobiles, bicycles, etc, 
has caused the price of rubber to go up and it is 
now profitable to cultivate rubber. Rubber culti­
vation is one of the most profitable businesses in 
the world. However, it is something like mining, 
you have to know the people with whom you deal. 
Each tree will yield anywhere from one to one and a 
half pounds per year. Very little attention need be 
given to trees after being started. The supply of 
rubber will increase each year owing to the large 
plantations that have been started. I believe the 
rubber from the plantation is better than the wild 
rubber, although some manufacturers do not think 
so. The rubber is made into hams about the size 
of a foot-ball. The native brings in his bucket of 
sap, starts a fire and throws into the fira a certain 
kind of nut. The smoke from the nut has the power

of coagulating the juice. The ham is built up in 
layers by successively dipping the stick into the 
rubber and coagulating each layer. Rubber may be 
coagulated by chemical means and when coagulated 
by chemical means is pure white. The plantations 
are in charge of technical men and are managed 
differently in South America, Mexico and Ceylon. 
Trees have been transplanted to Ceylon.
I will not go into the many steps which rubber 
undergoes at the factory. The output of rubber is 
about 65,000 pounds per year. Shoes were made 
of rubber just as it came from the tropics. You all 
know that rubber in this shape will do cnly in cer­
tain seasons of the year. An Englishman saw a na­
tive playing with a ball of this material. He took 
some of it home and made shoes out of it. In the 
winter time the crude rubber became brittle and 
cracked. If it had not been for the accident, and
I do not believe it was an accident, that the man 
who spilled the rubber on the stove with a little 
sulphur, we would not have the vulcanized rubber 
that we have today.
Goodyear was the man who was experimenting 
with rubber when the so-called accident occurred. 
At the same time Hancock discovered the process of 
vulcanizing rubber. The rubber is first cured, being 
run through three rolls and washed to get out dirt 
and to remove any stones which the natives may 
have placed in the rubber to increase its weight.
I have a sample here of a rubber ham sent to me 
by a friend. The sample came from Borneo, and the 
native there had been wise enough to put into the 
rubber a little bark which had the same density as 
rubber and in this way fooled the trader. As I was 
saying, the rubber is washed to remove any material 
that may be put into it by natives. The rubber is 
then put up to dry and vacuum drying is replacing 
the old method. Some manufacturers, however, 
think the new process not as good as the old. After 
drying, it is mixed and thereby hangs a long tale.
(To be continued.)
THE CRUCIBLE CLUB.
The Crucible Club held their first semi-monthly 
meeting of the year on last Friday evening, the 16th, 
at the Schools. The general program was so delight­
ful that even Dotty Felkel, the vice-president of the 
Society, showed his appreciation by smashing at two 
successive times half the brightly cleaned evaporat­
ing dishes that were to be used for the evening’s 
refreshments.
Dr. James was the speaker for the evening, and 
his subject, “Reclaiming processes of rubber,” gave 
us a very instructive idea of the complexity of the 
researches now being made in this new line. Dr. 
James has made this subject a part of his studies 
and has been doing research work on his own ac­
count. His samples of the different stages of rubber, 
accompanied by several demonstrations of the pe­
culiarity of the rubber in solutions, were very be­
fitting as an incentive, not only to the chemists pres­
ent, but to the mining and metallurgy students, for 
the promotion of interest we are getting out of the 
Society.
The presence of the third and fourth year night 
students of the Metallurgical and Chemical depart­
ments, gives us no room to doubt that the strength 
of the Society, after its several years’ struggle, is 
marvelous. Moreover, with two of our alumni pres­
ent at the first meeting, it is not a slide-rule calcula­
tion to look into the future and see how the interest 
in the Society will rapidly keep on increasing. We 
are proud of the fact that there could not be a much 
better way for getting our old men together after 
their graduation.
Incidental to the regular trend of the meeting, the 
committee on refreshments deserve a good deal of 
credit for making such an enjoyable windup to the 
meeting. Always equal to the occasion the Crucible 
Glee Club, while juggling ice cream, cake and coffee 
in the different chemical-apparatus recepticles, gave 
a farewell attempt at singing Mr. Sprague’s done 
song following:
(To the tune of John Brown.)
The Crucy Glee Club now will sing a song to Doctor 
James,
He buys up ancient boots and shoes and rubber he 
reclaims,
He'll make a rubber yardstick that we’ll use at foot­
ball games,
Hurrah for Unser Doc.
Everybody cheer for Doctor,
Everybody cheer for Doctor,
Everybody cheer for Doctor,
Hoorah! hoorah! hooray!
SOPHOMORE.
The inactivity that some members of the class 
have shown toward class affairs is very unfortunate. 
The man who does not take enough interest to help 
support and encourage class affairs is a great detri­
ment to the class, inasmuch as he is setting an ex­
ample which tends to decrease the interest of other 
members. In after life a man often recalls the years 
spent at college. The memories are the more pleas­
ant if he has taken an active part in the affairs of 
his class, and it behooves those members who have 
shown a lack of class spirit to come out and dis­
play the proper interest.

6THE TARTAN
M. M. x. S.
At a meeting of the Junior Night class of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School, the following 
officers were elected:
President—Anna M. Lindsey.
Vice President—Anna M. Gottfried. 
Secretary-Treasurer—Janet F. Molvie.
On Wednesday afternoon the school was ad­
dressed by Mrs. Hoodless of the McDonald Insti­
tute, Guelph, Canada. She has given years of study 
to the problem of woman’s education, and is the 
mother of the educational movement in Canada. 
She said in part:
“In presenting our plea for education along do­
mestic lines, we meet with least sympathy from the 
average housekeeper. The majority of women see 
only from their own individual point of view and 
resent the suggestion of a need of education. Many 
women ridicule those who devote their time to the 
study of domestic science. These must be educated 
to a broader view. The girls of the M. M. C. S. 
must be missionaries for a higher standard of social 
life. Women must be taught to govern their homes 
wisely and to train children for citizenship. To do 
this they must have some knowledge of the relation 
of the home to the state and realize their responsi­
bility in that relation. When women have learned 
to -make a business of home-making, and have real­
ized what a glorious business it is, they will find 
themselves too busy to care for the right to vote.”
The New Junior Class Song.
“So let us live that we may see 
The Seniors on a lemon tree;
Then we may hope the Plebes will be 
Refreshed by the Seniors’ cup of tea.
Chorus—
A useful life, a noble one,
That shall have much of service done;
To make the Plebes more glad and free, 
May this our purpose always be.”
Miss Arrowsmith—“Parse the pronouns in this 
sentence: ‘Give me your hand.’”
Miss Hender—“Me is first person.”
Miss Arrowsmith—“What gender?”
Miss Henderson—“Oh, masculine!”
The Junior class of the M. M. C. S. has elected the 
following officers for the year 1908-'09:
President—Ruth Doran.
Vice President—Jane O’Mara.
Treasurer—Frances Rayburn.
Secretary—Rhea Stewart.
Helen Day—“What is the difference between green 
gages and quinces?”
Social Ethics is a study of morals—
Of our thoughts, of our speech, and our acts.
If for yourself you’d win laurels,
Pay attention to these common facts.
And after you’ve learned how to rule them 
And have your own character formed,
Go forth in the world, show this system 
To others, for which lack they’ve been mourned.
Miss Donehoo’s “Poem,” Sen. Sec.
Miss Arrowsmith—“Ireland is noted for its gey­
sers.”
Miss O.—“Hot ones?”
Miss Fisher—“Give comparison of the adjective 
present.”
Miss Johns, “C”—“Positive, present; comparative, 
past; superlative, future.”
Miss Fisher—“Compare fruitless.”
Miss Pringle—“Fruitless, less fruitless, least fruit­
less.”
Mrs. Hoodless spoke to the Junior Household Arts 
girls on Tuesday afternoon. She spoke on home- 
making and the influence of the home on the state. 
Her talk was very interesting and gave us material 
for thought.
Mr. Church—“What is an even number?”
Miss E—“An even number is one which can he 
divided by 2.”
Mr. Church—“What is an uneven number?”
Miss E.—“One that is divisible by 3.”
Advice to Reporters.
If you have a thought that’s happy,
Make it short and crisp and snappy.
When your brain its coin has minted,
Down the page your pen has sprinted,
If you want your effort printed,
Boil it down.
Aren’t the new secretarial uniforms quite the 
niftiest, already yet?
Last week Miss Johns (Sen. Sec.) very plainly 
showed how intensely interesting and exciting the 
History lectures are, for when the bell rang at the 
end of the period, she awoke with a start from her 
little half-hour nap. Who shall say what she dream­
ed during that time?
“Oh, why such a crowd? What can be the matter?” 
My voice wouldn’t carry above all the clatter—
So I pushed and shoved till I felt nearly roasted, 
And found it was only a new notice posted.
“B.”

A Lamentation.
’Twas a quarter of nine one bright Monday morn, 
And forty some maidens were looking forlorn.
“Oh, why, tell me why, should maidens so fair 
Such a worried expression thus constantly wear? 
The reason, dear lady, I’m sad to relate—
But five minutes more and these girls will be late. 
For oh, this is one of our assembly morns,
And the girls must all be in their own uniforms.
In the dressing room all is confusion—
Gowns tan, pink and blue in profusion—
A waist now is lost, next a belt, and a cap—
‘Oh, where is my collar? The bell soon will tap.’ 
‘Oh, who has a pin?’ is the cry that we hear,
And Margaret Benner respondeth, ‘Why, here.’ ”
Oh, dear dressing room, with the one looking glass, 
Won’t you please tell why we are late to our class? 
Please, please tell the Powers of these our dire woes 
And perhaps then we’ll soon get more hocks for our 
clothes.
Miss Carlin's “Poem,” Sen. H. A.
Miss Henrietta Alcorn has been visiting in Phil­
adelphia during that city’s celebration.
Miss Stoner—“What is living matter?”
Miss Ramlaek—“Why—a—”
Miss Stoner—“Don’t begin that way, please. Once 
more.”
Miss Ramlaek—“Well—a—”
In the lunchroom after a lesson on rot being a 
form of combustion—
Miss Fuchs—“O, girls! I’ve got a combusted peach 
on my plate.”
What has become of the Glee and Dramatic Clubs? 
They certainly are missing factors. Of course we 
all know what a loss both clubs sustained when 
Miss Stutz left us, but we must get to work. Hurry 
up, Juniors, and let’s organize.
This notice appeared on the bulletin board Thurs­
day: “Will the girl who dropped the letter in the 
Tartan box, please call for same?” Wonder which 
one of the Plebes it was?
Mrs. Church (in Physics)—‘Three ways of cooking 
vegetables”—!
Miss Hartman, desiring to be in section “B” with 
Miss Rayburn, asked Prof. Esquerre to transfer her, 
she would not have to stand all day Thursday.
Prof. Equerre (next day)—“Miss Rayburn, would 
you minr’ ^banging sections with Miss Hartman?”
Miss Day (reading her composition)—“My para­
graphs are purely accidental!”
Miss Bradt thinks it is time the Tartan said some­
thing about her lunch room. We regret that lack of 
time prevented an article appearing this week, but it 
will be forthcoming soon.
A Tale of a Senior Cook.
Lucile cooked a little rice,
And when she saw it swell
Her soul was filled with great dismay—
And so she ran, pell mell,
To fetch another saucepan large,
The biggest on the shelf.
Soon that was full and running o'er, 
And Lucile, quite beside herself.
The rice it grew, and grew, and grew, 
Until it really looked 
As if we’d have rice every day 
Upon our menu booked.
The third day no Lucile appeared— 
Her courage failed, I fear.
And so the teacher turned it out,
But still it lingered near 
And waited patiently about 
Until Lucile returned.
We think she never will forget 
This lesson sadly learned!
911—NIGHT.
Dame Gossip is right again. Harry M. McCully, 
our' newly elected president, has finally decided 
to enter day school. All 1911 and other night 
classes bid “Mac” a fond farewell and wish him 
success. Vice President Wilharm, he of the flowing 
curls, will fill the vacant chair for the remainder of 
the year.
The famous pie-guard has not yet been reorganized 
since the defection of Col. Stamm. Major Hess, now 
of 1912, is not able to eat heartily at present, but 
may get busy when he feels better.
Murmurs are stirring concerning 1911’s annual 
smoker. When the social committee gets in work­
ing order, something definite and interesting may 
be expected.
1912 has reached the second “age of man,” that 
of “the laggard school-boy,” while > new “infant 
mewling and picking in the nurse’s arms” has ar­
rived in the class of 1913. Congratulations, 1912! 
You may soon be where we stand.
Will Munk please let the professors do the “chat­
tering” during class? “Anxious.”
Glad to see so many 1910 men back. They set a 
good example in faithfulness, if nothing else.

Apropos of the agitation the Tartan started a 
week ago to get the student body waked up to their 
athletic situation, we are publishing some signifi­
cant figures in this issue. We do not do this with 
any intention of scoring anybody, as we do not be­
lieve there is any cause for alarm, but we do think 
every one should acquaint himself with our status 
in all these matters and form an opinion and then 
fight for it.
Whatever our fortune in athletics this year, we 
can not say it is due either to lack of coaching or 
poor coaching, as we have had some of the best.
While Mr. Knox is entitled to all the credit given 
him, we should not forget his assistants when speak­
ing of him. Mr. Aude we know from last year and 
are learning to appreciate him more every day, but 
this year we have become acquainted with another 
assistant who has been able to instill quite a little 
of his own vim and ginger into our ends and backs.
When Mr. Snitjer first appeared on Schenley Oval 
most of the team thought him simply an interested 
spectator who evidently knew something about the 
game; but when he produced his note-book full of 
errors he had noted, we began to realize that the 
accusing finger was being laid on our exact weak 
spot. Since then we have learned to listen to his 
advice and avoid his criticism.
Mr. Snitjer is a “Native son of the golden west,” 
having been raised in California. He graduated 
from St. Matthews School at San Mateo, where he 
played end on the school team for four years. From- 
St. Matthews he went to Yale and graduated from 
Sheffield Scientific School in 1900. He was right 
end on the ’Varsity in Malcolm McBride’s team in 
1899.
After leaving college he took a position as instruc­
tor in Mathematics and foot-ball coach at St. Luke’s 
School, now at Wayne, Pa. After remaining at St. 
Luke’s through the year of 1900-1901, he went to Al­
legheny Preparatory School, where he was an in­
structor in science and coach of the foot-ball team,
remaining there four years. During the time he 
was at Allegheny, Coach Knox was a student under 
him and played on the team.
Since leaving Allegheny, Mr. Snitjer has been in 
business for himself in Pittsburgh.
According to the experience of perhaps every edu­
cational institution in the country, there is a time 
in their development when the matter ol' adopting 
some sort of an honor system by which to conduct 
the examinations, and some method of maintaining 
a student court for the purpose of dealing with 
cases affecting the students and the college, must 
receive consideration. Both of these have been dis­
cussed here. Both have been advocated by stu­
dents, and both have been ridiculed by others. 
Nothing has been done about either. While we re­
alize to the fullest extent “that the conditions here 
in the Carnegie Technical Schools is very different 
from that which exists at other colleges,” and that 
practically everything that is done is an unprece­
dented happening, nevertheless it is possible for 
these same two questions to be considered in our 
case as well as in the case of other older colleges.
The honor system as it is used in the majority of 
cases is a pledge on the part of all the students not 
to give or receive any aid of any kind during an ex­
amination, and to report any case of a student at­
tempting to give or receive aid. It is the last part 
of this pledge that is most frequently objected to. 
We have often heard it said that the honor system 
was all right, and was really the only method for 
college men to follow, but they wouldn’t agree to 
the part that made them tell of any one they saw 
cheating. To one who has never given the subject 
much consideration this seems like an unmanly 
thing to do, to “blow” on a classmate.
If any law or system is to work out properly, it 
must be made effective. If this clause were not i:i 
the honor system it would be anything but effective, 
and would make it all the easier for a student devoid 
of honor to cheat in the examinations. No faculty 
would stand for that. There is no difference be­
tween making information against a thief who 
breaks into a house and robs it of things to which 
he has no right, and making information against 
the same thing in a class room where the guilty one 
has no right to that which is not his. The report­
ing must be done. It is hardly likely that a feeling 
against the one who had done the reporting would 
exist, if it were thoroughly understood in the first 
place that any other man placed in the same posi­
tion would do the same thing as a «matter of duty 
to the college. Were this system in force no one 
could say it was spying or underhanded work when 
he himself was pledged to do the same.
The adoption of the system here would the right 
thing to do. Athletics is kept perfectly clean, and 
there is no reason why the class room and examina­
tion hall cannot be run on the same basis.

DAY INDUSTRIAL.
On Friday, October 16th, the second year Indus­
trial class held its second meeting. At the preced­
ing meeting Frampton was elected class president. 
It goes without saying that the disorderly kids 
who disturbed the meetings last year were properly 
squelched. The following is a list of elections:
Class President—C. A. Carter.
Class Historian—H. T. Young.
Secretary and Treasurer—D. B. Brown.
Tartan Representative—W. B. Drachbar.
Foot-ball Manager—D. A. Feigly.
Basket-ball Manager—W. S. Davis.
The class elected to support all class teams. It 
was then suggested that the upper and lower classes 
unite, so that instead of two good teams we might 
have one sure winner. This joining of the two 
classes in a common cause would do much towards 
advancing the feeling of friendship, so much to be 
desired. The second year men hope that the new 
fellows will “come right up to the scratch,” and 
instead of class disagreements and fights, there will 
be a spirit of harmony and good fellowship.
Mr. Day (in Mechanism Lecture)—Attached to the 
micrometer screw, is an electric bell, so arranged 
that when it stops ringing, you can hear it.
The Day Industrial School is represented on the 
foot-ball team by Brown and Frampton. We hope
to see some more fellows there before Thanksgiv­
ing.
Whither away my pretty maid,

With a scornful smile the pretty maid said, 
Wither, oh, wither away.
INDUSTRIALS’ ELECTION.

class, October 14, 1908, and the following temporary 
officers of the first year Industrial sections were 
elected:

An interesting series of experiments in the propa­

ATHLETIC FIELD STATEMENT.
On April 11th, 1908, the Carnegie Technical
Schools Athletic Association (through the treasurer) 
signed an agreement with Dr. J. Stewart Lacock 
mutually to erect and operate an Athletic Field.
Dr. Lacock is the lessee of the property, and 
through him only could it be obtained. For this 
reason it was necessary to take him into the part­
nership to obtain the Field. The agreement is for 
two years, or until May 1st, 1910.
By this agreement all the receipts (exclusive of 
student season tickets) are to be used to defray the 
cost and charges incurred for erection and opera­
tion, it being agreed that Dr. Lacock’s share of the 
expenditures are to be repaid during the first year 
prior to any profit accruing to either party. In case 
of a deficit this Association agrees to make good 
this loss.
Two separate accounts are kept, one of the Field 
receipts and expenditures, the other of the Associa­
tion transactions proper.
The portion of the student fees devoted to ath­
letics is used to defray such expenses as coach ser­
vices, supplies of all sorts for the various athletic 
teams and the many incidental expenses connected 
with athletics. None of this fund is used for Field 
expenses except in so far as we are obliged to loan 
from one account to the other from time to time.
When the Field contract was made, Director Ham- 
erschlag agreed to loan the Athletic Association a 
sum of money to help finance the project; how well 
he has kept his promise may be realized when we

The probability is exceedingly strong that we 
will repay our indebtedness this fall, though this

public, we may hope to meet our obligations at the 
end of the present season.

Results obtained in several tests of the Maxim 
silent firearm before the United States Army Board 
are reported to be decidedly encouraging, the re­
port of the explosion being only faintly audible. 
The muffling of the discharge is necessarily obtained 
at some expense of velocity, though the reduction is 
said to be only about six per cent. If the loss of Ve­
locity and energy be no greater than this, the si­
lencing of the report unquestionably increases the 
military value of the weapon.—Scientific American.
SHOP IMPROVEMENTS.
The Pattern Shop has changed its appearance 
materially during the past summer. While the 
equipment of heavy machines remains the same, 
more small tools and benches are in use. The turn­
ing lathes have been moved from their old place 
with all the belting on the floor level to the back of 
the room with the motor overhead and all the belt­
ing on a gallery, giving the rest of the department 
more room, and removing that look of congestion. 
Last week the entering classes were struggling 
away with the task of using a plane, and not for­
getting the “drag.”
Mr. Dosey and his Foundry were in full blast last 
week. Tech should be proud of having the finest 
and best equipped school foundry in the world, as 
it will be when the electric crane is put into place 
on the track built on the new steel gallery. Last 
year there were eight hand benches, and this year 
25 are in use.
The Machine Shop spread itself considerably, oc­
cupying the entire wing built for it. At present it 
rings with the sound of chipping and filing and a 
frequent dull thud of a hammer coming down on the 
hand of an unlucky victim.
The place to go to see the sights is the Forge 
Shop. It has also been enlarged; it had to be. Mr. 
Taylor has lots of new ideas, and it takes room for 
r^w ideas to be put into practice. Here we see the 
home-made stock rack, the uprights of L steel for­
merly occupied places in the scrap heap, and the 
rest is hand-made. New bending forms have been 
made, and legs put on the straightening plate. 
There are new tools and still new tools, all made 
by the industrious and enthusiastic Mr. Taylor, who 
is proud of his shop and has a right to be.
Mr. Snider’s new office, No. 109, must not be ne­
glected. It is situated in the Foundry entrance an­
nex close to the scene of its occupant’s chief field 
of labor, the lower corridor. Already it has taken of 
a bustle and business-like appearance.
In spite of -the worldwide depression, Spain is ex­
periencing a period of decided prosperity. The 
spirit of rejuvenation has extended to the navy, 
plans for the rebuilding of which are being actively 
prosecuted. Tenders have been submitted for three 
battleships, which will be about 425 feet in length 
and of 15,000 tons displacement, with a speed of 19% 
knots. Also three destroyers of 360 tons and 28 
knots and twenty-four 180-ton 26-knot torpedo boats 
are to be built, together with four gunboats of about
1,000 tons displacement. The battleships will be 
¦built at Ferrol, and the rest of the fleet at Cartha- 
gena.—Scientific American.
A LESSON IN (SIGN) LANGUAGE.
Kiss is a noun, though generally used as a con­
junction; it is not often declined, but is very com­
mon; it is not very singular, but is generally used in 
the plural; it agrees with ME.

SELF-REPAIRING AUTO TIRES.
An automobile tire company has in its salesrooms 
on Broadway, New York City, one of the most per­
fect machines yet devised for demonstrating the 
working of a tire under road conditions. Mounted 
011 a heavy stand, a big iron drum is driven by an 
electi ic motoi. An axle and wheel are mounted 
over the drum with the tire in contact with it and 
bearing its weight. The tire is under the same 
pressure as if on a loaded touring car. The test, a 
most severe one, consists in driving nails, spikes, 
etc, into the tire and tube and then running with 
them at rate of about twenty-five or thirty miles 
per hour. The tube is so impregnated with paste 
composition that the holes fill at once and the tire 
retains its air pressure. The machine is run by elec­
tric power and is also equipped with a speedometer, 
which gives a correct speed of a wheel as if in real 
road uses.—October Technical World Magazine.
At the last meeting of the Iron and Steel Institute 
in Great Britain, Henry E. Armstrong, professor of 
chemisrty 01 the London Central Institute, said that 
he found it “difficult to keep calm” when he reflect­
ed on the ruthless way in which the world’s stores 
of timber, iron, coal, and oil were being used up. 
The public, satisfied that science would discover a 
substitute for coal, was seemingly indifferent to the 
inevitable consequence of the present lavish waste. 
Science, however, is in no position, at present, to 
confidently state that any substitute for these fuels 
will be available in that near future when our pres­
ent supplies will be exhausted.—Scientific American.
That the Japanese are not always the mere imi­
tators which some people would have us believe, is 
shown by the decidedly original method they have 
adopted for carrying two submarines from England 
to Japan. The “Transporter,” a ship specially de­
signed for the purpose, has been built by Messrs. 
Vickers, Sons & Maxim for carrying submarines in­
tact. The engines are located aft, and forward of 
them the main deck for two-thirds its length has 
been removed. To place the submarines on board, 
they are floated into the drydock alongside the 
“Transporter.” The latter is sunk to the bottom of 
the dock, and the submarines are then floated into 
position above a pair of cradles built into the hull 
of the ship. The water is then pumped from the 
dock, and, as it subsides, the submarines settle into 
their respective positions in the hold of the steamer. 
The main deck is then replaced, and the ship is 
pumped out until she is afloat.—Scientific American.

APPLIED DESIGN.
The students of the Architectural Department are 
now working busily on the designs for which pre­
liminary sketches were submitted to the Society of 
Beaux Arts Architects of New York on October 3d.
In the Class A Plan Problem, four students sub­
mitted the preliminary sketch for a design for a 
State Sanitarium for the Treatment of Tuberculosis.
In the Class B Plan Problem, a design for an Ele­
vated Railroad Station, thirty-five sketches were 
submitted.
In the Class B Order Problem, a design for the 
Treatment of a Covered Bridge Connecting Two 
Public Buildings, forty-four sketches were submitted.
A number of one-day sketch designs were also sub­
mitted to the Society on October 10th, the subject 
being A ¡Swimming Club.
Eight or ten students are now engaged on the final 
drawings for the problem in Archaeology, which is 
to be rendered October 26th. The subject of this 
problem is A Clock Tower in the French Renais­
sance style. A number of these designs promise ex­
cellent results.
Mr. Weber, one of the instructors in Architectural 
Design, is for the present conducting the night 
classes in freehand drawing for Decorators and 
Architects. For lack of space in the school build­
ings these classes are now being held in the base­
ment of the Carnegie Institute. Mr. Weber is an 
accomplished draftsman and will no doubt conduct 
these classes with great benefit to his students.
The Department of Interior Decoration is begin­
ning its initial year’s work with an enrollment of 
eighteen students in day classes and fifteen in night 
classes. This enrollment for the first year shows 
the great need of such a department in the City. 
Probably no other School of Decoration in the coun­
try ever began its work with such a show of en­
thusiasm and so large a class.
The first problem in decorative design had for its 
subject A Title Page for a Portfolio. This problem 
was judged October 13th, and of those students sub­
mitting designs twenty received mentions. Of these 
the following students received special mention: 
Miss Evans,
Miss Krouse,
Mr. Nios,
Mr. Schoneborn,
Mr. Withers.
Prof. Ferrand began his work in the department 
last week as an instructor in design.

The Pedestrian in 1910.
Chug-chug!
Br-r-r! br-r-r!

* Gilligillug-gillillug!
The pedestrian paused at the intersection of two 
busy cross streets.
He looked about. An automobile was rushing at 
him from one direction, a motorcycle from another; 
an auto-truck was coming from behind, and a taxicab 
was speedily approaching.
Zip-zip! Zing-glug!
He looked up and saw directly above him a runa­
way airship in rapid descent.
There was but one chance. He was standing upon 
a manhole cover. Quickly seizing it he lifted the 
lid and jumped into the hole just in time to be run 
over by a subway train.—W. R. Rose, in Cleveland 
Plain Dealer.
The highest telephone in Europe, which runs to 
the Regina Margherita Meteorological Observatorv 
on Mont Rosa, at an altitude of 14,958 feet, is near­
ing completion. It was found impossible to run this 
line on poles, owing to the high winds and bad 
storms which prevail at these altitudes. It was also 
thought to be impracticable to lay an insulated 
cable, as it would gradually sink into the ice and 
would make repairs impossible. The final solution 
of the problem was to lay a- bare wire across the 
glaciers, and depend upon the insulating qualities 
of the snow and ice.—Scientific American.
The Forestry Bureau of the United States has re­
cently been investigating the preservation of cross 
arms for telegraph and telephone wires. The trou­
ble heretofore has been that the wood subjected to 
the creosote process has not been of uniform poros-
i y, some of the arms absorbing more of the preserv­
ative than was necessary, while others did not re­
ceive sufficient treatment. The Forestry Bureau di­
vides the wood into three grades according to grain 
and air dries them thoroughly in piles protected 
from rain and snow. The different grades are sep­
arately treated, receiving from 6 to 10 pounds per 
cubic foot. It is advised that the wood be not sub­
jected to the customary steam bath before being 
treated with creosote.—Scientific American.

WANTED—I?y the Plebe class—anybody who can 
play the piano for our entertainment at class meet­
ings. Salary may be taken out in applause.
The following committee has been appointed to 
select a class-pin: Gamble, Goff and Heckar. Any­
one wishing to make a suggestion with regard to 
design of pin should see the above named gentle­
men.
Professor—What is it you want to know now. 
Stone?
First Plebe—Do you think Solid Geometry diffi­
cult?
Second Plebe—Oh, no! If you have imagination 
and ingenuity, are cross-eyed, have common “horse” 
sense, and have had it before, it’s perfectly simple.
Prof. Follows drafted a portion of Sections C and 
D last Monday, and set them at work carrying 
things in the new building. The ones who escaped 
gave the merry ha! ha! to the unfortunates, but 
most people would rather carry anything than con­
struct lop-sided horrors under the impression that 
somebody else could recognize them without the 
head of hypnotism, mind-reading, and telepathy, to 
say nothing of Calculus.
A rumor is afloat that a member of the faculty 
has lost the note-book in which he kept record of 
the jokes he springs on each section. This 
is horrible! Any section may now be un­
lucky enough to be told the same joke several times 
in succession. We are waiting heroically for the 
blow to fall.

THE TARTAN
go straight to the class treasury without any fur­
ther expenditure on foot-ball gear.
It’s a question now whether we should use the 
striped hat or “Gov.’’ Stone’s “Texas Bill” hat.
I love to wander through the dells 
And o’er the verdant hills,
Where every modest signboard tells 
Of some one’s patent pills.
Hittner (talking in his sleep)—“Kickformation! 
Dowling back!”
Gamble was noticed to devote a whole important 
recitation period to the drawing of convict caps.
It is with regret that the class learns of the death 
of Secretary Osborne’s brother, which occurred last 
week.
It has been suggested that we have a large cake 
at the banquet, and that this cake take the shape 
of a gigantic cap and shall have black and white 
striped icing on outside.
We’ll better change the date of that banquet. No­
vember, we find, never owned 31 days. Let’s have 
it on—ahem!—a table.
The Freshman foot-ball team played Ambridge 
“Tech” last Saturday at Ambridge and were defeated 
by a score of 17 to 0.* Considering the heavy com­
bination they were up against, we can congratulate 
ourselves on being able to hold them to that score, 
as it is, they held Ambridge to a score of 0—0 in 
the first half, approaching at times dangerously 
near their opponents’ goal by a series of tricky plays, 
in which Traver, Schmucker and Mullen figured con­
spicuously. In the second half Ambridge “Tech” 
by making certain substitutions in their line, which 
increased their weight considerably, played havoc 
with our line, scoring three touchdowns before the 
game finished.
It is deeply to be deplored that Traver was not able 
to come out of the game unscathed. We sincerely 
trusts that ere long he will be up and about again.
