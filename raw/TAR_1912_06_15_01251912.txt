The Alumni Association of the 
Schools of Applied Science and De­
sign held a smoker at the Fort Pitt 
Hotel on the evening Saturday last. 
It is becoming so that all it is neces­
sary to say is simply that a smoker 
was held, giving the place and date. 
The rest will be understood. It will 
be known at once that all present en­
joyed themselves and the entertain 
ment provided for them. It will be 
known that some unique stunts were 
pulled off. It will be known that 
some very acceptable goods in the 
line of refreshments and smokes were 
provided, and it will be known that 
everybody took advantage of them. 
In short, the reputation so rapidly be­
ing acquired will soon make the writ­
ing up of an affair of this kind not 
only useless but superfluous.
After the atmosphere had reached 
the proper degree of thickness and 
blueness, a few members of the Man­
dolin Club started the ball a-rolling, 
that is they officially started it but 
it had nevertheless been going very 
merrily by its own sweet self ever 
since the first two members had ar­
rived. When graduates assemble to 
talk things over, then has no ordinary 
mortal more than a mere say-so. The 
selection of the Mandolin Club wa3 
received with a long Carnegie, the 
cheers being led by Mr. R. S. Dorn- 
berger, an ex-cheer leader from away 
back in 1909-10. Several men from 
the Glee Club followed with selec­
tions that highly pleased and amused 
the audience that filled the room com­
pletely. In order that the entertaining 
might not become too one sided, L. 
Linderman was introduced to the 
piano and was requested to furnish 
some of the popular melodies in order 
that all might join in the noise-mak­
ing. This was done with a right good 
will.
There has been one question which 
has been much debated on the sport­
ing pages of all the newspapers in 
the country and that is, “Can Jack 
Johnson lick Sam Langford?” To 
settle for once and for all this much 
mooted question, the committee hav­
ing the smoker in charge arranged 
the next feature on the program. For 
five rounds did the two wage a bat­
tle royal and although Sam had a lit­
tle the better of Jack in the fifth, it 
must be confessed the newspapers 
can still continue to argue pro and 
con. President Smith did not have 
the heart to take such a space filling 
item away from them by declaring 
the winner.
Then came more music, mandolin, 
glee, and general, and much talking 
and visiting by everybody. Managei 
Manker of the baseball team, was 
given an opportunity to put in a 
strong pull for his protege and he did 
so, with very good results. Mr. But­
ton also spoke concerning the coming 
home concert of the Musical Clubs. 
Then came the refreshments.
The refreshments disposed of, noth­
ing would do but that President Smith 
sing a song. This he did to the huge 
delight of all. Then he was forced, 
before he could call the meeting to 
j order, to tell the story of “Jock.” At 
the meeting Mr. H. W. Rieger was 
elected secretary to fill the place for­
merly held by Mr. Lucas, who was 
forced to resign on account of hav­
ing to go to California. The Tartan 
was also adopted as the official papei 
of the organization and a committee

The annual dance of the Beta Theta 
Epsilon Fraternity was held in the 
German Club, Tuesday evening, Jan­
uary 16th. There were about thirty- 
five couples in attendance, the frater­
nity entertaining Dean and Mrs, Leete, 
Dean Com, Mr. Fields, their alum­
nae and representatives from the other 
fraternities. Excellent music was fur­
nished by Nirella. Between the six­
teenth and seventeenth dances, a sup­
per was served in the dining room be­
low, after which dancing was resumed 
until two o’clock, concluding with the 
twenty-fourth dance. The hall was 
well decorated with Carnegie and fra­
ternity banners. Button, Colwell, 
Haaren, Walker and Manker com­
posed the committee responsible for 
the affair, which, if enjoyed as much 
by the members as by their guests, 
should be accredited to them a com­
plete success.

The White Friars are to hold a 
meeting shortly at which the question 
of the reorganization of the club and 
the producing of a play this year will 
be discussed, according to several of 
the officers of the old organization. 
The date will be announced and all 
members will receive written notifica­
tion to be present. It was stated by 
one of the officers that the meeting 
would be set for some date the week 
after mid-years were over and that, 
while nothing definite had yet been 
proposed, there was a fair chance that 
something in the way of producing a 
play this year, might be done, provid­
ed that those in closest touch with 
the situation thought that there was 
enough interest to carry the thing 
through.

We hear much regarding the Bean­
ery, very much. Indeed, we hear con­
siderable. We hear, for instance, that 
the Beanery beans are only related 
by marriage to the Leguminosae, 
which is merely another way of say­
ing the Bean family proper. We no­
tice that in the How’s W'hat column 
the author takes his courage in his 
hand and calls them "Has-beans.” Far 
be it from us to say such a thing, espe­
cially on the Editorial page. Yes, 
we hear many and diverse things. WTe 
are told yet again, that the pea in 
the pea soup fell in and was drowned. 
All of this is bad, very bad, and noisy, 
decidedly noisy. Yet, as in the Forge 
Shop, do the knockers completely out 
shout the persons singing the praises 
of the aforesaid Beanery. This fact 
has made us feel very bad, quite bad 
indeed. But also has the Beanery, so 
we are quits as far as that goes; there­
fore, we have about made up our 
minds that we are the only people in 
school who are in an unbiased frame 
of mind enough to speak of the mer­
its of that institution. Hence we are 
going *to elucidate upon the merits 
of our much abused Beanery.
Before we really start we want to 
make it clear that we are not entering 
upon the defense of this establish­
ment for the advance of mastication in 
the fond hope that the next time we 
deign to grace the portals we will be 
presented with a free plate of beans, 
a ham sandwich, or anything like that.
O mercy no! We are quite sure that 
we would not know what to do with 
such an apocrypal donation. Having 
settled in advance this question, let 
us on.
Of what use is it, we would like to 
ask, for you to spend your time in 
having your mind trained if you fail 
to acquire the inquiring twist of the 
investigator of scientific problems? 
We answer for you. There is none
at all. And what place affords more 
favorable circumstances under which 
to pursue such an investigation than 
the Beanery? You never thought of ' 
it? O dear me. Why you can, for a 
nickel, get a glass of milk which 
serves as a fine starting place for the 
beginner. It may lead you anywhere 
—it is sure to you drink it. Just 
take the glass and sojourn to a table, 
one not all ready occupied on six 
sides if possible, and you can investi­
gate to your mind’s discontent. You 
can first determine whether or not it 
is milk. That makes a good start. 
Then, if it is milk, you can easily 
figure out the number of horse-power 
expended in pumping water into the 
original milk as all required is a slip- 
stick, a pencil, a piece of paper, and 
that well-known empirical formula de­
rived by all humans, and most others, 
long before any knowledge of beans 
was acquired. And, again, if it is not 
milk to determine just what the com­
ponent parts are becomes a matter of 
stomach importance. In this manner 
you can spend a whole afternoon, just 
as we have spent a whole paragraph.
We read often that upon becoming 
more and more civilized we are los­
ing, to a greater or lesser degree, our 
natural senses. Being men with 
trained scientific minds we desire to 
prove for ourselves such a statement 
before we fold it to our bosom. The 
Beanery furnishes just the vantage 
ground from which to carry on such 
an investigation. The method of pro­
cedure is simple. The first day you 
ask the gent behind the counter to 
heave you over a roast of beef and a 
mashed potato. These you humbly 
accept and pass on the gen tie (a 
little more than a gent, see?) and 
plunk down whatever he may hastily 
compute that you owe him. You are 
select your table one well lighted and 
away from air currents, and 
ready to begin. Carefully note the 
smell, the taste, the feel, the hear, and 
the see of the specimen, writing down 
in best style the results of your ob­
servations. The following day you 
repeat, varying only in the choice of 
specimen for observation. This op­
eration you continue until you have 
exhausted the supply. You then are 
ready to tabulate the data and draw 
the conclusion that civilization has 
not only caused us to lose our senses 
but our cents and, if the experiment 
does not prove entirely fatal, our di­
gestions.
Thus, without any more elucidating, 
you can readily see that in your ar­
raignment of the Beanery you have 
lost several of its good points, just 
as you have probably lost your diges­
tion. It opens up a great field for 
trained minds. Ponder upon all of 
this as you carefully eat the pea that 
fell in your soup. Think it over as 
you attempt to crawl outside that 
piece of beef steak. Jump all over 
the subject as that pie a la mode you 
are eating is so very shortly going 
to jump all over the inside of you. 
And, doing these things, we feel sure 
that you will agree with us whbt wb 
say that the Beanery has its good 
points, PAs very good points—Wt Ahb 
cW;tb;s Wu Ahb tables.
The smoker held by the Alumni As­
sociation at the Fort Pitt Hotel last 
Saturday accomplished much more 
than the furnishing of a very enjoy­
able evening to those present. The 
short business session held after the 
entertainment proper was productive 
and interesting to the undergraduate 
as well as the graduates in as much as 
several of the matters acted upon are 
going to have a more or less intimate 
bearing upon undergraduate life. We 
are referring to the support given to 
Manager Manker of the baseball team, 
the adoption of The Tartan as the 
official publication of the association, 
the appointment of a committee to 
handle alumni news in The Tartan, 
and the decision of the association to 
publish once a year an Alumni Issue 
of The Tartan.
We have always been of the opin­
ion that there was not enough co-op- 
eration betwe.en the graduate and un- 
I dergraduate bodies of this institution. 
The fault has not been due to lack of 
interest upon the part of the gradu­
ates, as the undergraduates have been 
inclined to say, and the action taken 
at the meeting of Saturday evening 
in regard to the various student activi­
ties, and the support assured the vari­
ous entertainments and athletic events 
to come, precludes the holding of such 
a view. The fault has lain, in our 
opinion, more at the door of the un­
dergraduates, as they have not seen 
to it that the Alumni Association, 
through its officers, was kept posted 
as to the activities being carried on 
at Carnegie. What is needed, there­
fore, is more co-operation and the first 
steps in that direction have been 
taken. With a regular Alumni Editor 
it is to be hoped that The Tartan will 
each week contain interesting items 
concerning the members, and the do­
ings of the alumni. This in turn 
should make the paper more inter­
esting to alumni readers, thus furnish­
ing a regular means by which the two 
bodies, the graduate and the under­
graduate, may keep in closer touch 
with one another. It should also cause 
the undergraduates to take a more 
lively interest in the organization of 
which they some day hope to become 
a part. We are glad to see all of 
this because it means a more rapid 
and a better building towards the end 
to which all sons true to their Alma 
Mater are looking, the greater Carnegie 
Tech.

Cheer up! There is only one more 
day of examinations. For four days 
now we have been trj'ing our level 
best to make a sufficiently good qual­
ity of “bean” soup to soothe the Fac­
ulty palate and we trust that all of 
us have succeeded in our endeavors. 
Personally we rather wish the Faculty 
were willing to allow us to travel 
our peaceful way, but since they reso­
lutely refuse to give up their time­
worn privilege of demanding a ban­
quet of brains, served a la next year, 
the only thing remaining for us to do 
is to see that the meal is properly 
cooked and served. If the Faculty 
gets insomnia from the trying to di­
gest such a meal in so short a period
of time, they cannot place the blame 
on us. They should not give way to 
such an abnormal appetite, and that 
a week is needed in which to recover 
before entering upon the regular class­
room menu is to be expected.
They are a very funny thing, these 
examinations, when you stop to think 
about them. It is usually the fellows 
who like them least that take the most 
of them, all of which goes to show 
that the whole system is back end to, 
so to say. Looked at from the out­
side and at a time about six months 
previous to them, they seem all right. 
You say, “yes, while they are rather 
trying, they get us the results. They 
show us what we know.” Everybody 
nearly says the same thing under these 
conditions. What they say about them 
during the examination period we 
could not print in The Tartan. Why 
is it that the views of those taking 
the examinations suffer such a radi­
cal change? We are certain that we 
do not know. We only hope that some 
day some genius will come along and 
evolve some system which will make 
such apparently necessary evils un­
necessary. Moreover, we hope, good­
ness how we hope, that he will come 
along before our time is up.

Owing to the pressure of his outside 
work, Mr. P. O. Morningstar has been 
forced to resign from his position as 
Associate Editor from the School of 
Applied Industries to The Tartan. 
While Mr. Morningstar’s term of serv­
ice with The Tartan has been short, 
his work has been exceptionally satis­
factory and it was with great regret 
that his resignation was accepted. The 
Tartan desires to here wish Mr. Morn­
ingstar success in his new work.
Mr. George A. Hays has been ap­
pointed to fill the place left vacant by 
Mr. Morningstar.
It is with very great pleasure that 
The Tartan announces the appoint­
ment of Mr. Eugene Dowling, ’09 Sci­
ence, to The Tartan Board as Alumni 
Editor. Mr. Dowling is the chairman 
of the committee appointed by Presi­
dent Smith of the Alumni Association 
to have charge of the handling of 
alumni news in The Tartan, the other 
members on the committee being Mr. 
J. W. Considine, ’10 Science, and Mr.
H. J. McCorkle, ’11 Science.---------o---------

On Thursday evening, January 
Director Hamerschlag delivered 
address before the Westinghouse Club 
of Wilkinsburg, on the subject of 
“Educational Efficiency. Mr. S. L. 
Nicholson, sales manager of the West­
inghouse Electric & Manufacturing 
Company, who was to introduce Dr. 
Hamerschlag, had been unable to do 
so and his place was taken by the 
assistant superintendent.
The Director began by pointing out 
that in “These days when the 
word ‘efficiency’ is both used and 
abused with reference to every field 
of human activity and as it forms a 
basis of the report of the President 
of the United States to Congress, 
when the magazines devote many 
pages of their monthly issues to the 
discussion of the question, it is only 
reasonable that education which has 
been under a fire of criticism since 
the birth of man, should also have 
applied to it some of the tests and 
measurements to determine its effici­
ency.”
“It is a peculiar condition that 
whereas the human race has moved 
forward in cycles without respect to 
artificial lines that education itself has 
always been tinctured with national 
characteristics.”
The Director compared educational 
methods abroad and in this country 
and pointed out the action to be 
taken by educational institutions in 
order to produce in their graduates 
the high efficiency that will later on 
be required of them. In discussing 
this question, it is natural that we 
look toward the old countries and ob­
serve what has been brought about 
there by the experience of centuries. 
There has been a great deal said about 
the brilliancy of German engineering 
schools and its effect on the manu­
factures of that country; actual in­
vestigation, however, shows that the 
average German product is not better 
than that made in England or the 
United States. German technical in­
stitutes are generally efficient because 
they have a thorough system of train­
ing and a method of “elimination of 
the unfit.” The curriculum includes 
nothing but purely technical studies; 
an apprenticeship has to be served 
before entering; and the student has 
an academic liberty with respect to 
attendance and examinations that 
makes it easy for undesirable individ­
uals to quit and drop out.
The French technical institutes, be­
sides showing a reflection of that pe­
culiar Southern artistic taste, have a 
method of elimination of their own, 
which is, however, not as successful 
as the German system. An appren­
tice course of one year has to be 
served between the first and second 
years, and those that are not suited 
for the engineering profession gener­
ally do not come back. Schools of Ger­
many and France do not as a rule 
flood the market with the graduates, 
and since the government (or munici­
pality) owns both the institutions 
themselves and railroads, car lines, 
power plants, etc., there are many po-
sitions of honor and distinction open 
to its graduates.
Crossing the Channel, we reach 
England, where the seats of learning 
usually bear a very conservative char­
acter. There is no systém ôf'ëlimina- 
tion. Every student'who enters ex­
pects to graduate and if he fails to 
he objects. Hence many examples of 
men who fail to make good after they 
leave school.
Now entering America, we find 
many hundreds of colleges scacttered 
all over the country, trying to impart 
higher education. The big universi­
ties to some extent imitate the con­
servative English methods and there 
is a slight tendency to introduce Ger­
man thoroughness. There are only 
three institutions that insist on a per­
sonal interview before entrance. A 
feature of American education is the 
apprenticeship system as applied by 
the Westinghouse and General Elec­
tric Companies. Dr. Hamerschlag ex­
pressed himself not in favor of it; he ; 
thinks that it takes away two very 
fertile years of a student’s life, and 
that in some cases (not the W. or G. 
E. Co.’s) it is taken unfair advantage 
of by shop foremen. He advocates 
one year of apprenticeship before en­
tering-college, and a few months only 
after graduation. This would enable 
a student to profit much more by his 
college education.
Arriving at the question what edu­
cational institutions should do in or­
der to reach the highest possible ef­
ficiency, Dr. Hamerschlag summar­
ized his views as follows: The insti­
tution should aim to give thorough 
instruction; it should have a means of 
eliminating the unfit; it should require 
certain conditions to be fulfilled be­
fore allowing a student to enter; it 
should place the student in the proper 
department, and it should find the 
proper kind of position for him after 
graduation. *
There were hardly any empty seals 
and the hearty applause which con­
cluded Dr. Hamerschlag’s lecture, and 
several questions asked, showed that 
the audience had been appreciated. 
Three Carnegie’s and three Hamer­
schlag’s at the close of the evening 
indicated the presence of Tech men.

As a preliminary to the Juniata 
game, the second team played grad­
uates of Wilkinsburg High School. 
The game was fast and highly excit­
ing, good work being shown by both 
teams. Routh and D. Williams 
starred for the Scrubs, while Lind­
say and Clark showed up well for the 
Holy Citizens. The feature of the 
game, however, was the work of the 
referee (name unknown), who enjoy­
ed many brief naps. The first half 
ended 27 to 12 for the visitors, but the 
second team monopolized the second 
half, and the game ended 36 to 33 in 
favor of Wilkinsburg.

Tartan each year, thus accepting the 
suggestions made by The Tartan in 
their entirety.
After singing the Alma Mater and 
giving the Locomotive, the meeting 
broke up. The smoker had proved 
a grand success and this was due in 
no little measure to the splendid work 
of the committee in charge, Messrs. 
J. W. Dougherty, W. H. Rieger, and 
M. Thompson.* * *
Many interesting news notes con­
cerning the alumni and their doings 
came to The Tartan as a result of 
the smoker. It was learned that at 
the December meeting of The Ameri­
can Society of Mechanical Engineers, 
President George Smith of the Alumni 
Association was elected to an active 
membership in the society. Mr. 
Smith is the first alumnus to receive 
this honor, the granting of which was 
due to his work on thin lined, water- 
cooled boilers. Mr. C. A. McCollum 
of the same class, 1910 Night Science, 
was elected at a previous meeting to 
junior membership of the same so­
ciety.
Mr. J. W. Considine, who was ap­
pointed on The Tartan Committee, 
has taken up his work as chief en­
gineer at Morganza, Pa.
Mr. David K. Reid, ’10 Science, is 
now the chief engineer of the Atlantic 
Refining Company.
Third Baseman Miller, cf the firsi 
Tech baseball team, was elected to 
manager of the Alumni team, which 
is to open up the home season. He 
will pick a a team from the stars-that- 
have-been, and says that he expects 
to give the youngsters a stiff run for 
their money, at least.

The game with Juniata College on 
Saturday night, the 20th, was the best 
exhibition of basket-ball seen on the 
home floor this season. The Hunt­
ington five came to the game full of 
confidence inspired by their defeat of 
our neighbors, the University of 
Pittsburgh, by a score of 34 to 33. 
They showed themselves to be worthy 
opponents, but were outplayed at all 
times by the Varsity.
As a dance was expected after the 
game, the spectators numbered an un­
usual quota of ladies. The Carnegie 
Tech band added to the noise of the 
rooters, and filled in the pauses in an 
agreeable manner with music played 
as only the best bands can play.
The local quintet started the scor­
ing, Douthett furnishing the first goal. 
The score stood at 2 to 0 for several 
minutes, then Colvin made four points 
in a short space of time. Bigler scored 
the first point for his team on a free 
throw after five unsuccessful tries. 
Then Putt succeeded in finding the
basket for a field goal. Carnegie again 
increased the lead, and held the ad­
vantage for the remainder of the half, 
the score standing 12 to 9 for the peri­
od.
In the final half, the local boys set 
the pace throughout except for a few 
minutes in the middle of the period. 
The Easterners made six points in 
three minutes, and looked almost 
dangerous, but slowed down again af­
ter this brief spurt.
Keltz made his first appearance for 
the season, being sent in for Williams 
near the close of the first half. Ow­
ing to an injured ankle, he has been 
unable to play until last week, but 
appears to be in good shape once 
more. His speed made him a valuable 
man on last year’s team, and it is 
hoped that he may remain in the 
game. His only weakness appears to 
be from the lack of practice, that of 
shooting; otherwise he is the same 
Keltz as of yore. Colvin appeared in 
the star role, exchanging positions 
with Keltz in the second half. Douth­
ett and Heisell also played consistent­
ly. The team-work of the Carnegie 
players was the feature of the con­
test, and, with shooting to match, 
would have made a larger score.
Wardlow and Putt were the only 
men to perform noteworthy deeds, 
and both played well.
The line-up:
Car. Tech—24 Juniata Co.—21

After having the basket-ball game 
with Geneva apparently safe, the Var­
sity slowed down and allowed the 
Beaver Falls College to win by a 
score of 32 to 27. The contest was 
played in the Field House before a 
small, but appreciative, crowd on 
Tuesday night, January 16.
The home five started off well and 
had a nice score of 16 to the visitors 
8 at the end of the first period. They 
kept the lead during the first part of 
the final half and with ten minutes 
to play the score stood 23 to 16. Then 
Geneva started things,—or to speak 
correctly, Dodds started things,—and 
when the whistle blew for the last 
time, we were on the wrong end of 
the above-mentioned final score.
From the first jump the ball was 
taken into Geneva territory, and after 
being passed around for about a min­
ute, Colvin received the sphere bb­
neath the basket, and popped it in. 
Shortly after this Heisel made the 
second goal on a long chance. Dodds 
was given an opportunity to show his 
ability from the foul line, and made 
two in a short space of time, our men 
furnishing the opportunities by hold­
ing. Nelson broke away once for one 
field goal, but the visitors were kept 
from raising their score by that means 
again in the first half.
The second period opened with the 
Carnegie five setting the pace, but 
the boys slowed down considerably. 
When Geneva started to speed up, 
they left their hosts behind for a long 
enough period to run up a dangerous 
score.
In the last three minutes our boys 
again took the game into their hands, 
but it was too late to stave off de­
feat.
Dodds was easily the star of the 
game. In the last half he secured 
seven field goals and four fouls out 
of five chances. Nelson was his run- 
ner-up with a total of four goals. The 
whole team played well for Carnegie 
Tech, but the work of Colvin drew 
most praise. Kesselman’s guarding 
was the feature of that department. 
Hall, substituted for Williams, made 
two sensational shots. The work of 
the team showed improvement in 
many branches, especially in shooting.
The line-up:
Car. Tech.—27. Geneva Col.—32.
Williams (Capt.) F..................... Dodds
Douthett ............F....Nelson (Capt.)
Colvin ..................C................ Patterson
Kesselman .........G.................... Stauffer

ALVIN — Charles Klein’s strong 
play of financcial intrigue, “The Gam­
blers,” will be the attraction next week 
at the Alvin. The play was much
talked about in New York last season, 
and it has a cast of players of un­
usual strength. It ought to be worth 
while.
* * *
NIXON—Donald Brian and his
clever dancing are the chief assets of 
“The Siren,” which comes to the 
Nixon. The music is dainty but not 
distinctive.
* * *
DUQUESNE—“Charley’s Aunt,” an 
old farce that has had repeated stock 
company revival here, will be the bill 
at the Duquesne.
* * *
LYCEUM—This theater is permit­
ting a return of the musical farce, 
“The Girl in the Taxi,” which when 
presented here at higher prices a year 
or so ago was let severely alone by 
sensible people. It is not nasty, just 
plain stupid.

known Roumanian actress, will pre­

Beware! Complain not of the Bean­
ery or you way be treated like Miss 
Ewarts, of Syracuse University. The 
treatment she received for complain­
ing was described as follows in the 
New York Sun of January 21st: 
Syracuse, Jan. 20.—Miss Elizabeth 
Ewarts, of California, a junior in the 
College of Fine Arts of Syracuse Uni­
versity, was dismissed today from the 
university by Chancellor James R. 
Day. Her name headed a petition 
complaining of meals served at Haven 
Hall, a dormitory owned by the uni­
versity. After table wiatresses, kitch­
en help and the matron, Mrs. Georgi- 
ana E. Phinney, had been examined by 
the chancellor, Miss Ewarts was dis­
missed, as she submitted the com­
plaint. The other young women, real­
izing the fates of those who had on 
previous occasions complained of col­
lege affairs, wished their names with­
drawn, but it was too late. A public 
retraction is expected from them.
Miss Ewarts would not retract. Chb 
complaint was that the coeds were 
crowded at the table, that portions 
were scant, but not good and dessert 
lacking. The charge was made too 
that the prices paid for meals was too 
high. Mrs. Phinney says that the 
young women pay $3.75 for twenty- 
one meals, less than 18 cents each. 
She says also that the university h.s 
its own store back of Haven Hall, 
where supplies are kept for the three 
dormitories, Haven Winchell and 
Sims Hall, and that the supplies .;b 
never low.

^HE Carnegie Technical Schools consist of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
hchWWR Wu nppRPbm hcPbtcb—Offers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
hchWWR Wu nppRPbm DbsPgt—Offers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
hchWWR Wu nppRPbm ctmOsA;Pbs—Offers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, electrical 
equipment and installation, and training for industrial 
teachers. Short courses of eight months are offered in 
machine shop, pattern making, mechanical drawing, 
electric wiring, plumbing, foundry, forging and brick­
laying for more mature applicants who have had some ex­
perience in these trades.
i.;g.;bA iW;;PsWt C.;tbgPb hchWWR—For women only. 
Offers a regular course embracing two years of general 
training, with particular emphasis on home—making, 
followed by a year of vocational training in household

j “WanC'h WanC nTD alWs” j
No, Clarence, that low, rakish build­
ing with the 30-days-and-costs style 
of architecture is not the work-house, 
it is the School of Applied Indiges­
tion, vulgarly known as the “Bean­
ery;” and those grim-faced youths 
with the clamped teeth, and noble de­
velopment of jaw muscles, are not 
criminals, they are heroes rushing 
forward to take another desperate 
chance on the mean-you.
Some of them will squander as 
much as ten or fifteen cents in a mad 
pursuit of gastronomic adventures, 
and they will get the worth of their 
money, in assorted lots, solid, liquid 
and gaseous.
And those others emerging with 
the rapt and introspective expression 
have just “gotten theirs,” and are ex­
pecting a report from their depart­
ment of the interior with mixed feel­
ings of hope and apprehension.
It is a fascinating game as you see; 
let us go in and take a chance.
Now, Clarence, sit down in front 
of this bill of lading so b.eautifully 
engraved with chalk, and see if you 
can reach an agreement with your 
stomach as to the form of dietetic 
rough house it would prefer to en­
gage in. What is Irish stew? Come 
right in the water’s fine; so much 
cannot be said, perhaps, of the other 
ingredients. It is born of poor and 
it is to be feared, dishonest parents, 
and came to the land of the fee in 
the steerage. It doesn’t understand 
our gastric language very well, ex­
cept the cuss words. It formerly had 
a side partner known as Hungarian 
Shoelatch, but the latter was excluded 
by the immigration laws.
No, that is not a mob storming this 
shrine of hamburger steak (a dark 
and bloody mystery, by the way, with 
a recoil like an army musket), it is 
merely a stampede of Plebes, in fran­
tic alarm lest before they can get an 
opportunity to whisper their heart’s 
desires to the imposing corps of two 
pie-chaperones behind the breast*, 
works, the upper classmen will have 
grabbed all the indestructible rolls : 
(warranted for one year), and have , 
retired ravening with them to their 
corners; or that the surviving baked 
beans will have been transferred to 
the Carnegie Museum as has-beans. 
It is a notable scientific fact, Clar- j 
ence, that these Plebes are evolving 
“craws,” due to the lamentable cir-1 
cumstance, that after by prayer and 
fasting they finally succeed in acquir­
ing the peculiar forms of consolation 
they seek, they have no time to mas­
ticate within the time limit.
That gracefully drooping line they 
form, where those at the rear in their 
anxiety show tendency to fletcherize 
the necks of those in advance of them, 
has for its equation:
1 plate of beans plus 2 white-hope 
rolls, minus 10 cents, equals 1 belly­
ache.- . •
That corner where the small tables 
form a meager .fortification is the 
private ward for the Faculty, where 
they may practice their gastronomic 
vices in partial' sednsion, and per­
form the internal and external calis­
thenics necessary to a temporary vic­
tory over their food electives.
That group bent absorbedly over 
the rear table is engaged in a heated 
dispute as to whether the film on the 
butter plate is really an order of but­
ter, or the cook’s finger print. Those 
who so fatuously contend that there 
is no such concrete thing as a geo­
metrical plane have never witnessed 
one of these buteric phenomena.
But you must not let this divert­
ing vaudeville prevent you from se­
lecting prizes from this charming in­
ventory of more or less obsolete com­
estibles. Now here is some pie a la 
morituri salutamus; be a sport and 
j try a few rounds with it, Irish picnic 
rules, and no fouls called. If you 
last one round you get honorable 
mention; two rounds you get a hero 
medal and a student athletic ticket 
admitting you to all games except 
to those you most want to see.
You think it looks too much like 
suicide. All right, be a molly-coddle 
and dilute your manhood with toasted 
excelsior and vitalac. What! you 
think you will take an apple and a 
glass of water. Oh fie! fie, Clarence, 
you’re a quitter.

The Thistle Board are working their 
hardest to have the different individ­
uals and organizations who wish rep­
resentation in the 1912 Thistle, realize 
that unless the material is in the hands 
of the Board by February 15th, it 
will not be published. Few people 
realize that the engraver and printer 
both charge more for work received 
at a late date than for that which is 
handed in on time.
Now, that the final examinations 
have been completed—but probably 
not passed—we have a little breathing 
spell which gives ample time for every 
person in school to do their little 
share to make the 1912 Thistle the 
best ever. Any suitable article will be 
gladly accepted by the Thistle Board 
if signed by the person handing in 
the material. No names will be printed 
however, unless the wrter wishes it.
If you have any C.;tbgPb hpP;PA,

place for you.
