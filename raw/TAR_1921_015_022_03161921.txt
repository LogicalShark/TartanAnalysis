ALUMNI BOARD AP­POINTS MEMBERS RINGjMMITTEE
IVIr. Schmidt Presents Reasons 
for Adoption of New Ring; 
Too Many Changes at Pre­
sent Lowers Cost
GRADUATES TO HAVE VOTE
LAST STUDENT VESPER
At a meeting of tlie Executive Board 
-of tlie Alumni Federation, lield on 
Wednesday evening, March. 9, tlie 
question of a standard Tech. ring was 
discussed. C. B. Schmidt and H. G. 
.Nichol from the student Council and 
W. H. Obenaur, chairman of the 
Ring Committee, were present to bring 
before the board the viewpoint of the 
students. Mr. Schmidt stated some of 
the reasons why a ring should be 
adopted:
1. The present ring is not a suc­
cess, as it is more of a class ring than 
:a Tech ring.
2. The ring has been changed every 
year without consulting the previous 
class so that there are no two class 
rings the same.
3. The present ring is not impress­
ive enough for an institution the • size 
-and standing of Carnegie Tech.
4. The cost of the ring will be 
materially reluced if the same die is 
used year after year.
5. A graduate can get a ring at any 
time after he has left school, if there 
:is a standard die.
It was moved, seconded and carried 
that the Federation Board, as far as 
the alumni are concerned, empower 
the Ring Committee to go ahead and 
secure designs for a standard ring. 
It was suggested that, after designs 
have been selected, the Tartan and 
Alumnus should print cuts, with a] 
ballot, so that the graduates may have ‘ 
a vote on the question.
Mr. Nichol, as president of the Stud­
ent Council, requested two members of 
the Federation Board on the Ring 
Committee. Mr. Tilbrook and Miss 
•Stewart were appointed on the com­
mittee.
After the final design Is selected it 
will be pass ad upon by the Student 
Council, the Student Body and the 
Alumni Federation, thus minimizing 
the chances of any future body of 
students making any change.
Some of the Alumni have erroneous­
ly assumed tlie idea that the Student 
Council is trying to work up a new 
type of class ring. The Student Coun­
cil is trying to work up a standard 
“Tech” ring that will ' be a Graduate's 
ring and will be symbolical of the in­
stitution it represents. It wants to get 
away from the practice of having new 
class rings designed each year and 
get a ring that will stand forever. 
Few persons realize the trouble and 
expense involved in having a new ring 
made each year.
Also there is no more reason why 
each class, graduating from the in­
stitute and entering the Alumni body, 
should arbitrarily decide upon a dif­
ferent ring than there is for each 
group of pledges to adopt a fraternity 
emblem upon initiation. Is not the 
Alumni body a fraternity? It should 
he and it should have an emblem of as 
great significance and perpetuity as 
(Continued on Page Four.)
Tomorrow will see the close of the 
second successful year of the Student 
Vespers. John C. Acheson, president 
of P. C. W., is to be the speaker. It 
is felt by those who have attended 
regularly that these services have 
done, quietly, much to develop a 
deeper vein in the lives of many 
students—something acquired un­
consciously from having many splen­
did speakers who are interested in 
students, work with them and have a 
special message for them.
A banquet will probably be held 
the week following Easter vacation 
for students who have been interest­
ed. All Tech studen,., are urged« to 
come to the last service, Thursday, 
March 17, at 4:30, at the First Bap­
tist church, two blocks northwest of 
Ihe library.
COACH WAGNER ROUNDING 
HIS MEN INTO SHAPE
REVIEW OF BASKET BALL
With their victory over the West- 
inghouse Club on the Tech court, the 
Carnegie quintet finished the most 
strenuous schedule ever attempted by 
a Tech-basket ball team: The Plaid
• team played 26 games, winning 10.
In the 26 games, Tech scored 758 
points, while their opponents made 
863. The main point scorers for the 
Tartan squad were Dosey, McPhee, 
Bell; Hamman, Nichol and Gibson.
Next year Coach Iddings will have 
nearly the same squad to work with, 
only two being lost to the team 
through graduation, Hamman and 
Nichol. The squad during the past 
season consisted of Hamman, Senior 
Industries; Nichol, Senior Science; 
Leete, Senior Science; Mauer, Senior 
¦Science; Good, Senior Industries; 
Allen, Junior Science; Dosey, «Soph­
omore Industries; Gibson, Sophomore 
Industries; Wierman, Sophomore In­
dustries; Bell, Plebe Industries; Mcj 
Phee, Plebe Industries; Pittman, 
Plebe Industries.
All of these men have proven their 
ability and next year Tech may look 
forward to a better season than the 
one just passed.
The manager and captain of the 
1921-22 team have not yet heen 
chosen, but will be selected in the 
near future, and the basket ball ban­
quet will be held very shortly.
Much credit is due to Manager H. C. 
Henderson for his efficient manner in 
(Continued on Page Three.)
The baseball squad has heen work­
ing out on Tech field during the past 
week. There are about 50 men in 
training, including the veterans of 
last year. Many of the new pros­
pects have been showing up well 
in the workouts and are making 
strongs bids for regular berths and 
Coach Wagner is pleased with the 
showing of all the men. He says that 
“Everybody is on the job and doing 
their best in order that the best team 
possible will be produoed. Three or 
four weeks of training will put the 
boys in great shape.”
Tech has a veteran infield to start 
off with in Capt. Ray Doherty at first 
and "Napoleon Joe” Doherty at sec­
ond. During these preliminary work­
outs both Ray and Joe are fighting 
with the same old pep and speed that 
will make a great many of us sit up 
and take notice of their brilliant play­
ing around the first and second ter­
minals. Divilislus is full of his old 
familiar snap and ginger at third. 
“Divy” was a hard worker last year 
and is out for double action this 
year. Lynn and Durkin are putting 
up a great showing of the short field 
post. Coach Wagner has a couple of 
promising youngsters who are display­
ing class as infield candidates.
The outfield *lias the two veterans, 
Godden and Oakley, who are depend­
able as the best of them. 'Some bright 
prospects are rounding into shape for 
places in the outer garden. Comfort, 
Wierman and Reynor are making a 
classy showing.
The liurlers are going at top speed 
in their department and in a week will 
be doing the heavy' work from the 
slab. The pitching staff now includes 
about 15 men, all- of whom ..are clever 
performers.
TENNIS PRACTICE BRINGS 
OUT TWENTY-FIVEMEN
P. & D. DEPART­MENT UNDERGOING
New Department Stresses Art 
as Applied to Business and 
Commercial World
EXHIBITION OF WORK DONE
This new department will be made 
up of five branches, which are as fol­
lows :
(a).' Crafts, consisting of jewelry, 
silversmithing, pottery and weaving.
(b). Costume and textile designs, 
pertaining to modiste work and tex­
tile designing, for textile and silk in­
dustry.
(c). Normal art, preparation for 
teachers and supervisors in schools 
and colleges.
(d). Print shop and advertising de­
sign; a course for students who ex­
pect to become executives in charge of 
art departments of publishing 
houses. Business and commercial 
art.
(e). Industrial art, in'volving In­
terior decoration, furniture design,, art 
glass and ecclesiastical designs.
The aim of the Applied Arts depart­
ment is to teach art as applicable to 
the business and commercial world.
There is a very interesting exhibit 
of work done by students from the de­
partment of Painting and Illustration 
and Applied Arts, in the Division of 
Arts.
There are selections, including char­
coal, ink and color illustrations or 
paintings from the P. and 1. depart­
ment and jewelry, tapestry and pot­
tery from the department of Applied 
Arts.
The Painting and Decoration de­
partment has been reorganized. It is 
now known as two new departments, 
namely: Painting and Illustration,
which will do about the same work 
as done in this department before.
The department of Applied Arts was 
started this year in conjunction with 
the M. M. D. but has now been trans­
ferred entirely to the Arts Division.
MARGARET MORRISON 
DIVISION VISITED
CRAFTON WOMEN ENTERTAINED
First calL for tennis brought out 
about 25 men, with all sorts of ability,' 
ranging anywhere from nil to great.1 
There is a great deal of enthusiam 
shown at this early date/ due, no 
doubt, to the fact that the entire last 
year’s championship team was grad­
uated, thereby making it necessary to 
build up an entire team. From the 
material so far reported, although not 
quite so good as last year, bids fair 
to again acquire the championship of 
this section.
Among the men so far reporting for 
practice are, of last year’s squad, 
Captain “Jonnie” Harkness and Cop­
ley, Schmertz, Wade, “Rog” Marshall, 
Mawhinney and Hauser. There seems 
to be an abundance of new men, not 
meaning they are new in school, 
but that they are new to the tennis 
squad. Among these are Johnston, 
Hertzman, Pearlstein^ Stahlman, 
Hall, Kyle, Neville, Keil, Meyer, 
Brosky, Berno, Schwartz, Ricken- 
backer and Langworthy.
Colonel Brooks refuses to make any 
predictions at this early date, and 
just why he does this can easily be 
traced to the fact that at this stage of 
the tennis season all men look alike.
Manager Ravenscroft is busy ar­
ranging a good schedule, which ought 
to be ready for announcement at an 
early date. There will be two eastern 
trips arranged, which will give the 
tennis team a good opportunity to 
add many laurels to their already full 
string, as were acquired by the team 
which so ably represented Carnegie 
Tech last season..
Never before has Tech had such a 
good equipment for tennis as they 
have now. There are six first-class 
courts, which compare most favorably 
with the courts of any other college 
in the country. The Tennis Club has 
a balance of $148.00 in the treasury, 
with which to purchase needed sup­
plies and further equipment for the 
courts, and bring into good repair that 
equipment already on hand. The 
equipment already on hand includes 
six good nets, two heavy rollers, a 
marker and numerous brooms. It is 
the intention to purchase, or have 
built, a referee chair, and a locker to 
hold the above named equipment.
On Friday afternoon 80 members or 
the Crafton Women’s Club were en­
tertained by the Margaret Morrison 
Division. Luncheon was served in the 
Rec. Hall by the Juniors of Household 
Ec. Dept, under the direction of Miss 
Smith and Miss Keefer. The women 
expressel pleasurable surprise at be­
ing served' such delectable food, hot 
and in great abundance.
At the close of the luncheon Director 
Breed talked Informally to the club 
about the various departments, their 
equipment and courses. The members 
of the Public Occasions Committee 
then acted as guides, taking groups 
through the building and over to the 
Practice House, the latter causing 
much enthusiastic admiration. Several 
women were heard to bemoan the fact 
that they had no da.ughters to send to 
M. M. D., but as the “next best thing” 
declared their intention of sending 
their sons to Tech.
At the close of the tour of inspec­
tion the club visited the oxhibit at 
the Division of Arts and attended the 
play at the Little Theater.

DANCING UNTIL 3 O’CLOCK
The biggest three school function of 
the year was held last Friday nite at 
the Schenley Hotel, namely, the 
Prom.
The grand niarcli started promptly 
at 9:30 and was led by the president 
of the 'Science Junior class, Harold 
Skyrm, and M.»ss Helen Hester.
Dinner was served at 11:30, the 
large dining as well as the banquet 
room were necessary to accommodate 
the 200 odd couples present. Dancing 
was continued after the dinner until 3 
o’clock.
The favors this year were of brown 
heather, the Tech seal being em­
bossed on the inside cover of the 
card and stamp cases for the girls and 
of the note pads for the men.
Art Giles’ ten-piece orchestra 
furnished the jazz for the Prom and 
every one seemed to be well satisfied 
with their evening's pleasure and ex­
penditures.
The committee in charge of the 
promenade and who were responsible 
for the success of the fourteenth 
Junior Prom: W. M. Burke, chair­
man; C. A. Blescli, treasurer; W. R.

WILLIAMS SPEAKS
Tells of His Experiences as a 
Laborer—Musical Club Jazz 
Orchestra Gives Selectious
Whiting Williams addressed tho 
students at General Assembly last 
Wednesday on Bolshevism. Ho 
brought out that the best way to 
fight Bolshevists and Bolshevism was 
to keep laborers employed and satis­
fied rather than having them looking 
for work. For it is when a laborer 
is discouraged through hunting for a 
job that his morale is lowest and lie 
proves fertile ground for the sowing 
of seeds of Bolshevism by agitators. 
The agitators havo the right idea in 
working among the laborers and get­
ting them organized but it is tlie false 
end toward which they are working 
which causes tho trouble.
Mr. Williams spoke from his ex­
periences as a laborer in mines and 
steel mills both In this country and 
in England. As a laborer among the 
laborers lie was able to present the 
labor situation from the laborers’ 
viewpoint and did this in an excellent 
manner.
The Musical Clubs’ Jazz Orchestra, 
under the leadership of Kovalc, gave 
several selections as a preliminary to 
their Home Concert to be held April
15. Reilly’s solos were also enthusi­
astically received.
TECH MECHANICS CLUB
TO HOLD SMOKER
Each noon last week there was 
great excitement around the gym. 
Cause—trying out the new fire ropes. 
Every girl was required to make the 
perilous descent, and, especially while 
all the novelty was on, at the first 
trial there were many thrills and 
much discussion. Girls had a vision 
of dangling uselessly down the side of 
Margaret Morrison Hall to the ath­
letic field. Instead of this, however, 
each girl climbed cautiously to the 
fourth rung, of a step ladder, fastened 
the webbed belt under her arms, 
swung gingerly out from the ladder, 
and, remembering directions that 
“pulling straight down stops you, and 
the nearer the rope approaches the 
horizontal the faster you go,” de­
scended dizzily to the floor, four feet 
below.
A. V. O. CLUB
Last Wednesday Messrs. Calhoun 
and Peterson gave an illustrative lec­
ture on “Controllers” at a meeting of 
the club.
Mr. Peterson is an electrical en­
gineer and a graduate of the Science 
school. Most of those p/esent were 
night students who were the guests of 
the club.
The Tech Mechanics Club intend to 
hold a stag party and smoker the be­
ginning of next quarter. It is going 
to be some affair and all who attend 
are guaranteed a good time and some 
rare treats. The committee, consist­
ing of Jones, McClellan and Treharne, 
have promised several novel surprises. 
All members are urged to attend. The 
date will be announced in the near 
future.
SCiENCE SENATE
A meeting of the Science Senate 
was held Monday, March 7, in the 
Science club room. There were not 
enough present to form a quorum and 
therefore nothing of importance could 
be done. However it was suggested 
that Poverty Day would be held on 
Wednesday, March 16.
P. C. W.-TECH CONCERT
The combined musical clubs of P.
C. W. and Tech gave a very interesting 
program March 11 at P. C. W. The 
girls’ clubs were exceptionally well 
trained and presented several excel­
lent numbers. Reilly’s specialties 
wede well received. The soloists of 
the girls' clubs were very talented and 
both performed well. The Tech Musi­
cal Clubs give their home concert on 
April 15. This event is what all have 
been waiting for. The specialty num­
bers are clever and tlie balance of the 
program is well selected. Don’t forget 
April 15 and the formal afterwards at 
Hotel Schenley.

NEW STUDENT GOVERNMENT 
PLANS CONSIDERED
The last meeting of the Student 
Council was a rather short one. Fred 
Bloom reported on the progress he is 
having in invesigating council in­
signia. Miss Griffin,, as recorder, was 
instructed to draw up a list oC things 
which it will be necessary to havo 
next year’s council consider. These 
things haMo come up during the iprosent 
administration, but owing to their 
nature it 'has been impossible to dis­
pose of them.
Nichols presented for Council's con­
sideration a new, tentative plan of 
student government. The need of such 
a change in government was brought 
out by a speaker in one of the recont 
Science Assemblies. The plan, which 
was worked up by several students, fol­
lows tho form of the. United States 
Government, embodying a senate and 
representatives. The senato will 
function much as the present Student 
Council does, its members being elect­
ed in the same Avay. Tho number of 
representatives will bo determined by 
the number of students In school, ono 
for each hundred enrolled. The presi­
dent of the senato will be the con­
necting link between tho students 
and tho ',schoo(I. administration. A 
judiciary body will handle all dlsclp* 
Unary cases. Tho plan is still very 
new and It will probably take another 
year to got it worked up in all its de­
tails for presentation to tho students.
NOTRE DAME PURCHASERS 
DEFEAT TARTAN SEVEN 2-0
The Tech hockey team, playing un­
der a reversal of form, lost to Notre 
Dftino at Duquosno Garden on Wod- 
nosday night, 2-0. During tho first 
period both teams used seven mon 
and the game was slowed) up but In 
the socond and third periods six men 
teams woro used and enough, action 
was displayed for anybody.
Kastner, who started as rover for 
Notro Dame, scored the first goal five 
minutes after play began. He also 
scored tho other goal in tho third 
period. Kastner Is tho best man In 
colleglato hockoy seon in Pittsburgh 
for, some time, alhough Jewell gavo 
him a close chaso Tor his honors. It 
was almost Impossible to stop Kast­
ner, onco he started down tho ice and 
.but for the close guarding of Hed­
lund the, score would have boon 
higher. Kastner made tho first goal 
on a long shot from the side but the 
second he scored from scrimmage 
after carrying the puck down the ice.
The game was closely contested and 
only two short penalties were im­
posed, both on Notre Dame. Eldrldge 
had to retire from the game when ho 
collided with the side boards when 
lie attempted to- recover the puck In 
back of his own goal. Godden also 
had a mean spill, when he got mixed 
up In a scrimmage, but he was able to 
continue in the game.
Tech played a defensive game dur­
ing most of the contest and did not 
take the puck down the Ice much. 
During the first period the advantage 
belonged -to Notre Dame for their 
more aggressive play. In the second 
and third the game became more ex­
citing although neither side was able 
to score. Tech opened up more in 
the third period and displayed their 
best form of the evening.
In the intermission between the first 
and second periods “'Safety First” led 
a few “Long Carnegies” and while at­
tempting to a “Skibo” he pulled one 
of the neatest and most comical spills 
seen on the ice in a long time. The

DISCU8SION CLA8S
The Noon Discussion Class mot 
Thursday with Mrs. Scales and dis­
cussed the meaning of Happiness. 
They will meet again tomorrow In 
Room 315 to consider the duties of the 
individual to society and those of 
society toward him.
When the menu of a banquet com­
mences with Blue Points, arrives after 
several stages at. tenderloin ¦ steak 
with mushroom sauce and winds up 
with Neapolitan ice cream and calco 
with all the trimmings thrown in, 
nothing moro need be said concerning 
the eats part of tho program.
Such was the spread that greeted 
the members of the Carnegie Tech 
branch or the American Institute or 
Electrical Engineers as they assem­
bled tor their fifth annual banquet last 
Saturday evening, March 12, at the 
Seventh Avenue Hotel. Too much 
credit cannot bo given to Mr. C. R. 
Fleishman and his committee for tho 
arrangements, nor to Prof. B. iC. Den­
nison, who as toastmaster kept tho 
assembled Electricals in good humor 
with his collection of L. H. J. jokes.
After ovoryono had oaten his fill oL’ 
the aforementioned spread, Professor 
Dennison, after a few introductory re­
marks, Introduced Mr. II. D. Jam.es of 
the Control Division of tho Wosting- 
house as the speaker of tlie evening. 
Mr. James had chosen for his sub­
ject “Tho Human Factor in Engin­
eering,” a subject which proved Itself 
to bo both interesting and Instructive. 
He traced the ¦ development of tho 
engineer as an organizer, from tho 
earliest days down to tho prosent 
time, citing Herbert lloovor as ex­
emplifying, in tho work ho has ac­
complished and the success which ho 
has attalnod, tho highest development 
of tho science.
According to Mr. James thoro are 
three classes of engineers. The fiirst 
class, though not nocessarlly tho bosi; 
or most successful, Is tho class of tho 
would-be executives, the young mon, 
tochnlcal graduates, who wish to at­
tain to tho presidency of their com­
pany without first going through Llio 
process of seasoning and dovolopmont 
nocossary to train and fit them for 
tho covoted position. Those mon, 
says Mr. James, speaking from his ox- 
porlonco as a Wostlnghouso execu­
tive, drift to tho ¡smaller organizations 
whoro their alms can bo realized moro 
quickly than with a large company, 
which In the end can and would 
ofl'or moro opportunity to Its engin­
eers than can tho small concern. Tho 
socond class of engineers is oxom- 
plillod by Stolnmotz. Tills Is tho class 
of the theoretical, mathematical en­
gineers, who can reduce all problomn 
to moro or loss higher mathematics. 
Tho third class, and the largest and 
most successful class, Is composed ol! 
tho mon who go through the season­
ing process so distasteful to tho mon 
of the first group. These are tho 
men who are not afraid of the 10 or
15 years of work required to mature 
their rnlnds to make thorn fit for ex­
ecutive positions of tho highest 
type.
Mr. James also touched on tho new­
ly organized American Federation of 
Associated Engineers, of which Her- 
bert Hoover is the first president. 
This represents co-operation in tho

DEBATE TEAMS MEET W. VA. AND W. & J.
Tech’s first intercollegiate debate 
will be held on Friday evening, April
15. One team will debate University 
of West Virginia here in the Arts 
theater, and the other team goes to 
Washington, Pa., to meet W. & J. 
Through a misunderstanding another 
event was later scheduled for the 
same evening. This is an unfortunate 
circumstance, but Tech Is big enough 
to support the two affairs. Professor 
Peterson, who is coaching the team, 
reports good progress is being made, 
and that our opponents will have to 
spring some surprises if they are to 
win. Meetings are held three times 
a week, at which the question is dis­
cussed pro and con. This preparation 
involves much hard work which de­
serves recognition and therefore tho 
debate should be supported.
NIGHT INDUSTRIES HOLD DANCE
Last Saturday, to the strains of 
Maggie's orchestra, the night men of 
the Division of Industries stepped out. 
It was some dance and, without doubt, 
was tho best social affair tho night 
men have held this year. The com­
mittee, consisting of Molxnor, Craig, 
Hays, Knapo, Matlat, Mullin, Flawin- 
skl, Reich and Shaver, Is to be com­
plimented on the way the dance was 
managed. Mr. and Mrs. Pfouts were 
tho chaperons.

A NEW ACTIVITY
The debate which is to be held in the Arts Theater the evening 
of April 15 marks the advent oil intei*-collegiate debating at Carnegie 
Tech. Although the Forum, -which was organized some time ago 
here has held several debates among its members, this is the first 
occasion on which debating teams from other colleges have been 
brought here, or Tech debating teams sent to other colleges.. The 
debate in question \vill be a triangular one, teams'from 'West Vir­
ginia, Washington and »Jefferson and Carnegie Tech participating; 
and the discussion should be interesting. The contest merits a good 
attendance by the student body, and needs our support. Everyone 
at Tech should feel interested in giving this new activity a boost.

Within the last month or so, a certain vogue seems to have 
sprung up in. the Margaret Morrison Division to produce theatrical 
entertainments of a kind, presumably, for the purpose of replenish­
ing class exchequers. It is far from the purpose or desire of the Tar­
tan to throw cold water on the activities of any class or division, but 
we do feel constrained to protest against the quality of the offerings 
mentioned.
The t,wo recent productions appear on the face of them to be 
jiothing more or less than a flagrant commercialization of the good 
will whigh the other divisions bear toward the girls’ school. The 
standard of entertainment has not been what one has a right to 
expect for the price of admission. Even to a person inclined to be 
most tolerant to the inevitable flaws of amateur performances, these 
attempts seem quite inexcusable. Of course, no one expects to be 
entertained with the glibness, originality or humor of the professional 
stage, but noithcr can one pardon the lack of that which is well 
within the province of the unprofessional. For instance: General 
lack of preparation, absence of originality and a poor sense of what 
constitutes good entertainment, cannot be forgiven. We believe if as 
much time had been spent on the actual preparation of the show as 
was expended on the advertising, and, in one case, on the expend­
iture of the proceeds, this editorial might have assumed a different 
vein. If any theatrical, ambitions still Jie in the breasts of the' two 
remaining classes ol! the division in question, let us hope that they 
will take warning from these few well meant words and either put 
on a show that is worth while, or stifle their pardonable aspirations.

highest degree among engineers of 
the present time, and should go far 
to raise the standards of the pro­
fession in this country. He mentioned 
the new organization of the Associated 
Engineering societies of Pittsburgh, 
and the two recommendations made 
by this body to President Harding, 
namely, that the first vacancy on the 
Interstate Commerce Commission be 
filled by an engineer, and secondly, 
that an engineer of national reputa­
tion be chosen assistant secretary of 
the navy.
Director Mott, the next speaker of 
the evening, emphasized the fact that 
the real engineer is always a student. 
He does hot forsake - his studies when 
leaving college, but continues at all 
times to improve himself in his pro­
fession by constant study and re­
search. Dean Mott also forsobk his 
usual custom and urged students to 
enter the teaching profession, point­
ing out the great need of capable in­
structors for the college student and 
citing the difference in conditions of a 
few years ago and the present time in 
the teaching profession as regards 
the remuneration.
Sergeant. Hunt;, who served overseas 
with the Third Division, told some in­
teresting stories of tho early days of 
army radio, when wireless was a fear­
ful thing to handle, and static was 
blamed promiscuously when tho dem­
onstration to the eager public did not 
demonstrate. His capture of a town 
near tlie Marne was enjoyed by all.
Professor Wurts followed his usual 
example and gave an examination, in 
geography this time.* Tho exact num­
ber of R’s has to tho present time not 
been computed. Prof. P. S. Donnell,

GIVING THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT
The secret of success is furnishing the people what 
they want.
America has given a most absolute demonstration 
that it wants “Life Insurance” by paying three 
hundred fifty million dollars for new policies alone 
in 1920; twice as much as it paid for it in 1919; four 
times as much as in 1900 and sixteen times as much 
as in 1880 and this in spite of haphazard sales 
methods.
Translating this history into prophecy indicates tre­
mendous opportnnitjr for tomorrow.
College men and women are peculiarly adapted for 
success in this fruitful field—a fact proved by 
figures.
To those who can qualify, a Post-Graduate College 
Course in Life Insurance Salesmanship at Carnegie 
Technical School at Pittsburgh is offered.
The rewards are immediate, substantial and cumu­
lative. • .
The Edward A. Woods Company desires to tell you 
the experiences of some college trained men and 
women who are making a big success with it.
Your inquiry will receive careful attention.

THE HIPPODROME
NEW YORK CITY
tfEW people know that the two Hippo- 
drome stages are gigantic Otis Elevators 
whose plungers have a total combined lifting 
capacity in excess of half-a-million pounds. 
The main stage may be'lowered to be used 
as a tank, giving a depth of thirteen feet of 
water.
This may surprise some who know Otis 
only as makers of elevators. The Otis 
institution, reaching out into every country 
of the civilized world, is a gigantic engineer­
ing organization devoted to the vertical 
transportation of men and materials. Nothing 
in this field is too big for Otis—nothing so 
small that it has not been included in their 
accomplishments.
Pioneer in the elevator industry, leader from 
the first, Otis still keeps years ahead and is 
even now planning, building, inventing and 
designing for a future leadership as sure as 
that Otis now holds.
Alost of the fatuous buildings of the world 
arc equipped with Otis Elevators.

Last week saw the passing of the three principal winter sports at Tech 
and practice for the spring contests get under way. Basket ball ended with 
the Geneva game at Beaver Falls, leaving Coach Iddings and his men free 
to don track or baseball suits and leave the gym until next winter. Like the 
football teams of the past few years the Plaid five concluded the present 
season in a blaze of glory, winning their last three games and leaving a good 
impression for next year. The Bucknell game was won in impressive fashion, 
after the Lewisburg boys had handed Pitt a defeat the night befoi'e. Looking 
forward to next year, prospects for a good team are bright since only two men 
on this season’s team will be lost through graduation.
While the result of the Notre Dame contest was disappointing to the many 
ardent followers of the 'Skibo hockeyists, the Tech sextette displayed a good 
brand of hockey and gave their opponents a hard game. The Hoosier team 
can boast of one of the most finished hockey players south of the Canadian 
line in Carstner, their captain and left defense. He can skate, take the puck 
down the ice, and shoot in a style not seep at Duquesne Garden since the P. 
A. A. games last season. Carstner is an all-round athlete and in addition 
to his hockey playing, won his letter last fall in football playing at fullback 
along side of Gipp. He also is a star hurler of the Notre Dame baseball nine. 
Carstner comes from St. Paul and has a brother who made a reputation for 
himself a f£w years ago as an athlete at the Universitysqf Minnesota.
•Manager Copley reports the meets for the boxing and wrestling teams 
scheduled with Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Allegheny have been can­
celled and the mat and ring men have ended the 1921 season. Tech men will 
be disappointed to learn this as much interest has been shown in both teams 
and it was hoped they would both be able to get into action before a home 
crowd. Great difficulty was experienced, in arranging any kind of a schedule 
at all for the teams and Manager Copley is to be given a great deal of credit 
for starting teams in the two sports and putting them upon a firm basis for 
next year._________________________________________________________________________

TRACK SQUAD PRACTICING
HARD UNDER IDDINGS
The Tech track squad has issued a 
call for recruits,, and with several of 
last year’s men back have started 
training with a total of about 30 men. 
However, Coach Iddings points out 
that there is .a great need for men in 
the weights and also in both the low 
and high hurdles. Tlio track on Tech 
field is to be torn up% and resurfaced 
and put in first-class condition for this 
year’s meetfe. At present the greatest 
efforts are being made in order to 
prepare the relay team for the Penn. 
Relays. Two of Tech’s 10-second men 
are out and have good team mates to 
fill out the liineup. Kelly and Tall- 
man are probably to be the leaders 
of the team in the dashes and of 
course mean much to the relay 
teams. Schwab, Donahue, Dykeman, 
Romhue and Lockwood are all on the 
training bill also.
Landis, the holder of the school 
championship in the hammer throw, 
is out and much is expected before the 
season is over, but there is a decided 
lack of men out for the weight 
events.
All the distance events will he well 
taken care of by veterans from the 
1920 squad. Greenlaw and MacDon­
ald will run the two mile with. Cooper, 
Nichols and Bailey representing the 
Plaid in the mile.
The Tech record in the shot put is 
rather low, so that there is big open­
ings in this event. Sprinkle is so far 
in the lead but the season is too young 
to tell just what the coach can de­
velop.
Practice is held eveiy afternoon at 
4:30 and Coach Iddings would like to 
see.more men out.
good practice for an alert brain. In 
these respects It is much like tennis. 
Fact is the only difference between the 
two games can be said to be in the 
use of one’s hands in lieu of a racket 
and in the size and arrangement of 
the court.
The game has a certain allurment 
to all types of boys and men, from 
almost the cradle age to the age of 
infirmity—and, according to many of 
its devotees the constant player of 
hand ball need not ever advance into 
the age of infirmity.
Mr. Moses, the C. I. T. physical di­
rector, has constructed four standard 
American hand ball courts
After straggling five and one-half 
hours for wrestling supremacy, Tom 
Davis, former captain of the Univer­
sity of Maine football team, and Er­
nest Abbott, a former Colby athlete, 
were forced to quit from exhaustion, 
at Bangor, Maine, recently. Spectators 
of the long contest on the mat de­
manded that it he called off and the 
referee declared it a draw. Davis was 
champion wrestler at Camp Devons. 
Abbott has been prominent among 
Maine devotees of the sport. Both are 
residents of Bangor.
Princeton’s hockey team repeated its 
first victory over Yale at the Boston 
Arena, defeating the Blue team by a 
score of 4-0. The game makes Prin­
ceton the winner of the series with 
Yale.
HAND BALL
Hand ball, as a game, can hardly be 
classed as a parlor sport, for It cer­
tainly can produce some extreme con­
tortions of the body, and a few bucket 
fulls of good old “sweat.” It furnishes 
all those requirements for a long 
youth—it has plenty o£ action, there­
by causing good practice for the eye, 
good practice for quick movement and
Langley Laboratory gymnasium. These 
are dpen jit all times of the day to all 
students and members of the faculty.1 
Mr. Moses is very anxious to have' 
these courts in constant use, and as­
sures all who would give the game a I 
chance a. very pleasant and enjoyable 
hour.
In regard to the game, it might be 
stated in this article that there are 
two games recognised. They are the 
American game and the Irish. It is 
just as well to play either game, but 
it is best, to play one game, and stick 
to it for all times, and furthermore, it 
is very essential for all men in any 
given section of the country to play 
that one game. The American game 
is the one that is used throughout the 
United States, and for that, reason the 
courts in the Langley Laboratory were 
marked off as such.

The Field For Practice
Within the Westinghouse Company there 
is the broadest possible opportunity for the 
man of theory. Westinghouse studies every, 
problem from the generation of power to its 
use by the consumer.
In every type of power plant, stokers for 
the boilers; motors for pumping; in the en­
gine room, turbines, condensers, and gener­
ators. From power house to consumer, 
transformers, converters, switchboards, and 
line material.
In the industrial fields, besides generating 
apparatus, electrical motors of every kind, 
control apparatus, lighting and special de­
vices. In transportation, motors, control­
lers, and switching devices; automotive and 
marine equipment.
In the home, electrical washing and iron­
ing machines, irons, fans, toasters, percola­
tors, stoves, ranges, vacuum awiepers, 
lamps, curling irons—all this for the farm as 
well.
The design, manufacture, and sale of 
these products are fields of great opportunity 
for engineers.

TECH'S GREATEST CAMPUS 
WEEK.
M. M. C. ALUMNAE ARE
DOING THEIR BIT
The M. M. C. Alumnae have proven 
themselves as one of Tech’s most loyal 
organizations. Their success depends 
upon two things:
1. They believe in Tech and are al­
ways willing to lielp.
2. Whatever they undertake they 
put across.
After all in college life the suc­
cesses that are harvested come from 
the fight and pep that has been put 
Into them.
The girls are certainly doing their 
share in helping out athletics which, 
at the present time, are very much in 
need of assistance. Three $100 scholar­
ships have been given by the Alumnae 
Association besides ?200 subscribed to 
r.he Athletic Drive. At the present 
time the girls are preparing for a rum­
mage sale and if finances permit there 
will still be another donation to ath­
letics.
This should bo an example to the 
Alumni Associations of the other 
divisions and should Inspire them to 
take more interest in Toch and its 
activities.
Lot every graduate and former stud­
ent prove himself true and loyal to his 
Alma Mater by being a real TECIIITE.

During the past few weeks the 
Pittsburgh Clan has been very active. 
It was one of the few organizations 
that stuck to the end In helping to 
put across the Athletic Drive. Meet­
ings were held every day in the Cham­
ber of-Commerce during the drive, at 
which time financial reports / were 
made.
On the 10th of February the 
entertained at luncheon all 
musical organizations. After 
luncheon the musical (Organizations 
gave a concert In the auditorium of 
the Chamber of Commerce for mem­
bers of the chamber and Tech alumni.
The clan feels that no end of good 
has come out of the drive. Disregard­
ing the drive, the associations that 
have been made during the past few 
weeks among Tech men and women 
have done more for Tech's alumni 
than anything else. Plans are under 
way now to make the Pittsburgh Clan 
a bigger and better organization. One 
of the plans suggested is the getting 
up of a TECH BUSINESS MEN’S 
DIRECTORY. We have communicated 
with all the other clans for the pur­
pose of interchanging such business 
lists. It is believed that this one item 
alone will eventually build the clan 
into a powerful organization.
The last meeting of the clan was 
held March 12, at which time new 
ofilcers were elected. The clan is 
planning to have a weekly luncheon in 
the Chamber of Commerce, at which 
time Tech’s current topics will be dis­
cussed.
The alumni know they are weak, 
but believe they are on the right track 
and are ready to fight to the end for a 
real Alumni Association.
J. W. BATMAN, 
Secretary.

PHILADELPHIA CLAN
The Philadelphia Clan held its reg­
ular monthly meeting at the Arcadia 
Restaurant on Saturday, March 5th, 
with 16 members present. A pros­
pective Tech man, now a student at 
West Philadelphia High school, was 
the guest of the clan. After dinner a 
business meeting was held with the 
president, Mr. Exlines, in the chair. 
Mr. Henry Schaub spoke of a joint 
meeting with the Harrisburg and 
New York Clans, which was being 
planned and also urged the members 
of the clan not to forget Campus 
Week this year.
In reply to a communication from 
the. Monongahela Clan it was decided 
to protest the adoption of a new de­
gree ring, thup making the old ring 
used by several recent classes of no 
value.
After discussion of plans for future 
meetings short speeches were made 
by several new members of the clan.

(Continued From Page One.) 
any fraternal organization. As mat­
ters now stand it has nothing ap­
proaching a standard emblem. There 
lire a number of class rings being 
worn, but with all due respect to these 
rings, they cannot be considered more 
than class rings.
The Alumni approve! heartily of our 
efforts to standardize the ring, but 
object to having the lings which a few 
of them are now wearing robbed of 
their significance. It is d I ill cult for 
us to understand how this can be. 
The class rings being worn now, be­
cause of their design, have the sig­
nificance only of class rings. They are 
emblems of the classes adopting them 
and no amount of student action,, or 
any other action, can alter their sig­
nificance in the least. Moreover our 
efforts preclude anything pertaining 
to class rings; we are considering 
nothing in that line.

WHY WE NEED YOUR CLAN AND HOW YOU CAN HELP
This notice of hielpful suggestions is for the following Tech Clans: 
Akron, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Erie, Harrisburg, Hartford. 
Johnstown, Monongahela Valley, New York, Philadelphia and Youngstown.
In the Alumni Office at school, we have experienced many difficulties in 
getting the clans to report meetings, meeting dates, etc., so below we are 
listing some suggestions which we urge all clans to follow:
1. Answer promptly all mail from the Alumni Office.
2. Ask occasionally for revised list of Tech men and women in 
your locality. This will keep you in touch with all new Tech people 
who . locate in your clan district.
3. Send into the Alumni Office reports of all meetings and notices 
of meeting dates so that this information can be used for the Tartan.
4. Remember your clan is our best way of keeping in touch with 
Tech people outside of Pittsburgh. For this reason, your co-operation 
is needed at all times.
We ask that every clan follow carefully the above suggestions which 
will help us who are trying to help you in building up a strong Alumni 
for Tech.
Your co-operation Is needed at all times, so be 100% Tech.
J. W. BATMAN, 
Assistant Alumni Executive Secretary.

ATHLETIC PHOTOGRAPHS
The Varsity Club room in the gym­
nasium will soon be completed and 
we need athletic pictures, banners, 
etc., for decorations. Athletic teams 
and activities have been organized at 
Tech since 1905 and we hope this no­
tice will reach all Tech people having 
pictures representative of teams and 
activities from 1905 to the present 
time./
Your co-operation in sending in any 
pictures will greatly help the Varsity 
Clan and it will be the first step to­
wards a larger club room in later 
years.
To help the boys that have helped 
you send in to Frank H. Haaren, grad­
uate manager, at oDce any pictures 
you might have of activities and past 
and present athletic teams.

The First Athletes.
The Greeks were among the first 
to insist on gymnastics as part of the 
early training of the child. They act­
ed on the principle of “a sound mind 
In a sound body,” and thus the moral 
training of the young was included in 
the physical work carried on in the 
gymnasium.
What Eyebrows Tell.
Thin eyebrows show a lack of vital­
ity and thick ones a highly-vitalized 
temperament, together with power of 
endurance. Highly-arched eyebrows 
denote a . sensitive temperament. The 
average eyebrow is a combination of 
black and red.
