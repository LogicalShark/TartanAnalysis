THE CLASS CONTEST 
SOPHOMORES WIN
The Battle of Green, September 
twenty-second, nineteen hundred and 
eleven, Anno Domini, has been fought
the matter. Mr. Manker has been de­
signing special machinery all sum­
mer.
and is now relegated to the realm of 
fhistorv
The^grass has fulfilled one of its 
many functions and transformed a 
field deluged with Sophomore and 
Freshman gore to one of greenness, 
the slain have been buried and the 
field raked clean of sundry fragments 
of underwear, shirts, pants, bibs and 
dighties. An atmosphere of rest and 
quietness reigns over the one time 
iscene of conflict and strife. What was 
n armed camp is now transformed 
nto a green bill board pasture.
In reading about a great battle, the 
eader is usually anxious to know 
hat the battle was about, what the 
one of contention was, what motive 
Impels men to thirst for each other’s 
*gore.
In connection with last Friday’s 
ruffle, this question appeared to dis­
turb a rather quiet, unsophisticated 
newspaper reporter, who approached 
Mr. “Lefty” Manker, one of the Sen­
ior Class referees, during the hostili­
ties, and asked what it was all about.
r. Manker could not have been more 
hocked than was the master of the 
orkhouse, of whom Oliver Twist 
sked for more gruel. The questioner 
did not even quail under Mr. Manker’s 
withering look oi pity, but simply re­
peated his question.1
 While pitying such ignorance, Mr. 
lanker was under the necessity of 
xplaining to this layman that the 
¡contest was for the sole purpose of 
boosting the higher education, and 
'that each contestant was purely and 
Jpolely actuated fromrthat standpoint.
Such a display of altruism and in­
tegrity of purpose on the part of the 
contestants appeared to impress the 
reporter as he took copious notes on
Well, the festival was very success­
fully pulled off, although i< might 
said in passing that it was also a little 
pulled out or rather stretched out. 
The weather was ideal, no one was 
hurt badly, and to crown all, the ladies 
enjoyed the fun. We all like to make 
the fair sex happy. Unquestionably, 
the hero of the hour was Mr. “Tex” 
Ramsdell, our popular football coach, 
who was master of ceremonies during 
the festivities. The stalwart presence 
of the speedy Texan, commanded at­
tention from the ladies on the grand 
stand and obedience from the rabble 
on the field. Considerable credit for 
maintaining order during the contest 
is due to the Senior Class referees, 
whose awe-inspiring presence was re­
markably effective in putting a wet 
blanket upon any unseemingly digres­
sion from the rules governing the con­
test.
It might be well to give the names 
of these gentlemen so tijat the knowl­
edge of the noble part they played 
can be carried down to posterity. They 
are as follows:
Schmucker, Manker, Williams, Scott, 
Cogswell, Kindi, Calloman, Cornelius, 
Knapp, Lamoree, Sfcott, McClure, 
Henderson, Brown, Ormston.
Mr. Ormston was in Oil City this 
past summer.
The wrestling bouts refereed by 
Mr. Joe Choynski, the boxing in­
structor of the Pittsburgh Athletic 
Association, and incidentally the only 
man that has knocked out Jack John­
son, were very excitable events, and 
were followed closely by everybody.
Those expecting a display of Jiu 
Jitsu from Mr.’Ozakai, the plebe hail­
ing from the land of the Mikado, were

ADDRESS OF WELCOME
—o—
DIRECTOR HAMERSCHLAG 
SPEAKS TO STUDENTS.
—o—
The address of welcome to the 
students was delivered this year in 
the Lecture Hall of the Institute last 
Thursday morning, and was for the 
students of all the Schools. The house 
was crowded with the Faculty and 
students, many of those unable to find 
seats, standing in the rear of the 
hall. '*¦
The exercises were opened by the 
singing of “America,” led by Mr. Mc­
Dowell, as only he can lead, with Miss 
Stoner at the piano. Director Ham- 
erschlag then spoke to the students, 
the substance of his speech being as 
follows:
“One of the most important move­
ments of the people of today is the 
great stride that has been taken in 
the last year toward international 
peace and the arbitration and settle­
ment of international disputes. This 
was cited in contrast to the fact that 
about 2,000,000 young men between 
the ages of 18 and 25, lost their lives 
tr< Nrpol^anic wars'/'anH about an 
equal number in our own Civil War. 
How much better for the world when 
there are no wars and all these lives 
need not be sacrificed.
Affairs of more vital interest to the 
citizens of this city were then spoken 
of. Some order has been brought out 
of the chaos of municipal affairs by 
the nine new councilmen appointed 
last Spring'by Governor Tener. They 
have, as far as possible, managed the 
business of the city in a thoroughly 
businesslike way. Their administra­
tion has been non-partisan and en­
tirely satisfactory to the best element 
of the city. There is movement on 
foot to defeat them at the coming 
election and install some of the former 
councilmen and other politicians. Shall 
we put in men of a lower type? No, 
a non-partisan seems to be the desire 
of the people. Party lines should be 
wiped out if they give bad govern­
ment as they have in the past.
Education in general was another 
topic dwelt upon at some length by 
the speaker. Parents of the present 
day are coming to realize more and 
more that it is a mistake .to send 
young men out into their life work 
too young. The body and mind should 
be given the necessary preparation in 
order to get the full benefit out of life 
and be of use to one’s fellow men. 
We must do our part to accomplish 
this development, one of the most es­
sential features is looking after our 
health by taking active part in suita­
ble athletics. The mind cannot do its 
work unless the body is properly taken 
care of. Each student should strive 
to. make our School athletics fair to

FOOTBALL AT CAMP 
CARNEGIE.
The 1911 football season at Carne­
gie Tech was given an excellent start 
this year by the preliminary practice 
at Camp Carnegie.
On September 5th, a squad of about 
fifteen men took possession of the 
camp and began the season by in­
dulging in light kicking practice. Each 
day the men took long walks over 
the Freeport hills, and .accustomed 
themselves to the feel of the pigskin 
by kicking and passing the ball. Head 
Coach Ramsdell was with the men all 
the time, and was assisted at various 
times by Mr. McCulloch and Dr. 
Marks. Open air accommodations 
were provided for all, six big tents 
being used, exclusive of the mess tent 
and kitchen, so. that much benefit was
COACH RAMSDELL
derived from the out-of-doors living. 
Practice was held on the new athletic 
field, which was prepared during the 
summer, so that the men had all the 
advantages of the home grounds. 
Although the camp was enjoyed by 
comparatively few men, owing to a 
number of fellows having to take fall 
examinations, a precedent has been 
formed, which will be of great benefit 
to all the athletic teams in the future. 
Preliminary work of such nature hard­
ens the men for the later work, and 
gives all a chance to smooth off the 
rough edges before the hard work be­
gins.

THE NEW TARTAN.
It has long been felt by Faculty and 
Students alike that the TARTAN, ow­
ing to its small circulation, was not 
doing the work nor making the place 
for itself that it should and many 
schemes were thought of and pro­
posed with the end in view of broad­
ening the field covered. Finally a 
plan was suggested and adopted and 
with this issue the TARTAN enters 
upon a new era of its existence.
At a meeting of the Committee on 
Student Activities held last Spring, a 
plan was adopted whereby one copy 
of each issue of the TARTAN is to 
be given free to each member of the 
student body. In consideration of this 
fact the management of the TARTAN 
is to be eligible for assistance from 
the Student Activities Fund by an 
amount depending upon the net in­
come received from all other sources, 
this amount never to exceed a fixed 
maximum. On the part of the TAR­
TAN it is agreed that any profits be­
yond a certain fixed sum shall be 
donated to the Student Activities 
Fund. This means an increase in 
weekly circulation from between 600 
and 700 copies to about 2,500 copies. 
It should mean a still greater increase 
in the interest displayed by the in­
dividual members of the student-body 
in the work which the TARTAN is 
trying to do.
The TARTAN has always tried to 
be a representative organ. In keep­
ing with this, we have decided to
change the form of organization of 
the Editorial and News Staffs. Under 
the new plan there will be an Assis­
tant Editor from each of the four 
Schools. These Assistant Editors will 
have entire supervision of the news 
items of their respective Schools, be­
ing held responsible to the Editor-in- 
Chief for the thorough “covering” of 
the same. There will also, as here­
to fore, be Associate Editors whose 
duty it will be to look after all items 
of general interest and importance. 
Following the plan laid down last 
Spring, there will be a Staff of Re­
porters, who will be chosen strictly 
on merit by competition among the 
lower classes, the idea being that these 
men will work into positions on the 
Editorial Board. This plan, we firm­
ly believe, should make the TARTAN 
a paper which is not only truely rep­
resentative, but one which will furnish 
the student body with the most inter­
esting news of the week.
It is obviously impossible for even 
our augmented staff to gather to­
gether all the various happenings of 
the week, and we earnestly appeal 
to the individual student to assist us 
in this matter, jotting down and giv­
ing us any items which may come 
under his observation. It should also 
be remembered in this connection that 
the space available in the TARTAN 
is limited, and that we must therefore 
choose for publication such items as 
seem to us to possess the broadest in­
terests. It is also hoped that the 
TARTAN can secure adequate office 
room in one of the buildings wherein 
it can perform its work in an efficient 
manner. Any articles or manuscripts 
submitted by others than those on the 
Editorial Board will be filed, whether 
used or not, and kept on file for a 
period of two months, during which 
time some member of the Board will 
be glad to go over the article with 
the author, telling him why it was not 
used, if such should be the case. We 
request that all articles be signed in 
full by the writer, together with his 
class and section, in order that they 
may be acknowledged.
It will be noted that the form of 
issue of the TARTAN has been 
changed. This was done after due 
consideration by the Editorial Board, 
the idea being that the TARTAN is 
a weekly newspaper and not a weekly 
magazine, and that it therefore should 
be published in the news sheet form.
The aim and purpose of the TAR­
TAN remains unchanged. It is de­
voted to the betterment of the Car­
negie Technical Schools in every way 
possible, and, incidentally, to keep the 
different student bodies in closer 
touch with each other. The good-will 
and support of the entire student 
body is a very necessary factor for 
success under the new plan and we 
expect that it be given, thus enabling 
the TARTAN to occupy the field of 
usefulness towards which it aims.
WANTED—A MANAGER
In another part of this issue the 
announcement of the final starting of 
the Publicity Bureau is made. This 
Bureau is an important addition and 
has long been talked of, but certain
difficulties seemed to stand in the 
way and to prevent the putting of 
the plan into action. However, late 
last spring a meeting was held, at 
which all agreed not to disagree, so to 
say, and to leave all the points for 
later settlement. It is now hoped that 
by Friday of this week a manager 
can be appointed and the Bureau set­
tle down to the work of finding it­
self.
It is always important to get as the 
head of an organization a man capable 
of performing the required duties and 
in the present instances this is partic­
ularly true, the duties being heavy, 
as much that does not appear on the 
surface will fall upon the shoulders 
of the man chosen. There are sev­
eral candidates in the field, all good 
men, and it is extremely difficult to 
make a choice. The TARTAN, as 
in the case of all student organizations, 
is keenly interested in the outcome. 
We feel that the man chosen should 
be, if possible, taken from the upper 
classes, preferably a Senior, and that 
the position should be regarded as 
a goal towards which to work. We 
believe that the position calls for much 
more than the ability to get adver­
tisements. We believe that it calls 
for a great deal of tact, and ability 
to handle men, to build up a perma­
nent organization, a willingness to 
pass petty unpleasantness, and a 
strong sense of right and wrong and 
of fair play. If it is not possible to 
get such a man from the upper class, 
we would be willing, in this present 
instance only, to waive our objection 
to an under-classman, but we do not 
doubt that a man can be found in the 
upper classes who has the necessary 
requirements. We sincerely trust that 
this new Bureau will start on its mis­
sion under the leadership of a real 
leader.
TO THE FRESHMAN.
Now that you have been initiated 
into the mysteries of the higher edu­
cation by the Sophomores and are 
now ready to settle down to your 
studies in real earnest, a few words 
of counsel bearing upon yourself and 
your future relations with the school 
will not herewith be amiss.
As a man is judged by the company 
he keeps, so is a school judged by 
the kind of student it keeps within 
its doors.
Such being the case, it is incum­
bent upon you as a student of this 
great institution to so govern your 
conduct and deportment to the end 
that the outside public will be favor­
ably impressed towards the schools 
thru you.
Remember, you are a walking ad­
vertisement for the schools and if 
your personality and deportment is 
such that the people you come in con­
tact with, attach weight to what you 
say and do, they will unconsciously 
attach weight to the institution of 
learning you attend. Therefore, gov­
ern your deportment from this stand­
point. Endeavor to give yourself a 
clean cut appearance. If you cannot 
afford to clothe yourself properly, you 
can at least make liberal use of the 
clothes brush and the thread and
the thread and needle. Wash your 
face at least once a day and take a 
bath at least once a week. Water and 
soap, hair brushes and combs, thread 
and needle and clothes brushes are 
cheap, hence, there can be no excuse 
for your being relegated to the cate­
gory of the great unwashed and 
classed as a bowery bum because of 
your dirty and slovenly appearance. 
Be gentlemenly, particularly to your 
classmate, avoid the knocker and avoid 
knocking.
Give your class and class officers 
your hearty support and whenever 
possible endeavor to do what you can 
for the school activities.
If you are a stranger in the city, 
connect yourself with some local 
church and Sunday School of your 
particular denomination.
Let clean living, high thinking and 
good fellowship be your standard 
while here and you will spend a happy 
and successful sojourn at Tech.

—O—
Goes Into Effect With This Issue.
—o—
The TARTAN greets all students 
at the beginning of this, the new aca­
demic year of 1911-12, in a new coat 
and in a new guise. The observing may 
have noticed that when they paid their 
fees and received their pieces of paste­
board that there was a new one, such 
as they have never received before. 
That is the welcome that we, of the 
TARTAN have in store for the old 
men and our greetings to the new. 
We trust that our welcome will be 
reciprocated more warmly than Presi­
dent Taft’s treaty was reciprocated in 
Canada.
That little piece of pasteboard 
meant this. You, each one of you, are 
to receive a copy of each issue of the 
TARTAN free. In return for our 
unprecedented generosity we expect 
that you will dutifully read it and do 
everything in your power to help us 
and the good work along. So that 
yuu can get at the bottom of this 
and find out the exact reasons for 
our action, we have written a little 
editorial which you will find in its 
proper place and we recommend 
strongly that you begin by reading 
it.
This year the TARTAN will be dis­
tributed from room No. 2, Industries 
building, and each man is asked to 
be sure and have his card with him 
when he asks for his copy. We feel 
that it is necessary to make this hard 
and fast rule and it is to save any 
trouble on your part that we make 
this request. The TARTANS will ar­
rive from the printer in time for dis­
tribution each Wednesday at three 
o’cock, any time after which you can 
obtain your copy.
The Handing in of Articles.
As we tried to make it clear in the 
editorial, we are very glad at any time 
to receive articles on any subject of 
faculty or student interest, and will 
acknowledge the receipt of the same 
whenever the name, class and section 
of the sender is given. These articles 
to insure publication in the issue of 
the following week, should be in the 
TARTAN boxes by Friday night, the 
collection being made late that night 
or early Saturday morning. If the sub­
ject has something to do with the 
interests of your own particular de­
partment, it would be better plan to 
hand it to the Assistant Editor from 
your School. This saves time and 
trouble and insures more prompt at­
tention.
We may from time to time have to 
make changes in our method of doing 
business, and will beforehand make 
the necessary announcements.

4THE TARTAN
SCHOOL OF APPLIED 
INDUSTRIES.
MANY CHANGES DURING 
SUMMER.
The opening of the School of Ap­
plied Industries is marked with sev­
eral changes and improvements in 
both class rooms and shops so that 
the School is in excellent condition to 
care for the increased number of stu­
dents.
Registration has been heavy, and 
while no definite figures can be given 
until next week, the indications point 
toward a record breaking year, both 
in the total registration and enter­
ing classes.
* * *
Among the many improvements, 
perhaps the machine shop claims first j 
attention. A gallery has been erected 
on the north side, extending the full 
length of the shop. At the right of 
the entrance are two sound proof lec­
ture rooms, which will do away with 
the annoyance to both lecturer and 
students, of having to mix the lec­
tures with the various noises of ma­
chines in operation. The work bench­
es have been placed on the second 
floor and their places taken by the 
milling, boring and planing machines. 
This leaves a large vacant space for 
the installation of additional lathes 
which will accommodate a much 
larger number of students. The effici­
ency of the machine shop has been 
increased about 50 per cent.
In the Electrical Equipment and 
Construction department, consider­
able apparatus has been received for 
the dynamo laboratory. We note a 
number of new voltmeters, ammeters, 
Wheatstone bridges, testing sets, etc. 
The department has also received a 5
H. P. A. C. motor and two series 
motors with controller and gears for 
series-parallel operation, and also one 
crane motor. A new lathe for wind­
ing and repairwork completes the new 
equipment of the Dynamo laboratory. 
An important addition to the Lecture 
room to be soon installed, will be two 
of the largest indicating instruments 
manufactured, viz., a voltmeter and 
ammeter, both Weston type.
The Foundry Pattern storage room 
has been equipped with several new 
shelves for the convenient storage of 
new patterns.
The Forge shop, with the exception 
of the new air line which will be in­
stalled soon, is in first class shape for 
the year.
The Pattern shop, Plumbing and 
Building Construction shop have all 
been put in excellent condition for 
the ensuing ear.
The Department of Industrial 
Teaching has been supplied with new 
instruments for psychological experi­
ments.
* * *
In Assembly Hall several changes 
have been made. A broad centre aisle 
has been cut from the entrance to the 
front platform, while the side aisles 
have been closed and the lantern plat­
form moved to an independent loca­
tion directly above the entrance. The 
seating capacity has thus been in­
creased to nearly three hundred.
Mr. Emery’s drafting room has been 
moved from the first floor and the 
new vacancy converted into an addi­
tional class room for mathematics.
The recitation and class rooms as 
well as the drawing rooms have been 
refinished and decorated. Taken as 
a whole, the various departments have 
never been in a more promising posi­
tion nor more amply equipped to care 
for their students, than they are at 
the beginning of the present school 
year.
* * *
The students of the School of Ap­
plied Industries extend a most cordial 
welcome to the new instructors in the 
various departments, and their desire 
that both may work harmoniously and 
with a co-operative spirit, so that at 
the end of the year they may have 
ecquired a “bumper crop” of knowl­
edge and experience.
COURSE. 
M. M. C. S. OFFERS A NEW
A new course has been added to 
the curriculum of the M .M. C. S., 
that of institutional management to 
train matrons and housekeepers. It 
is to supply a demand for mature 
women of experience, with good pro­
fessional and business ability, to act 
as matrons and housekeepers in dor­
mitories, hospitals, city and county 
institutions, and as managers of 
lunch and tea rooms, that the new 
course has been added.
This is a special course open to 
adult women only, and is apart from 
the regular three-year day course for 
girls. Those who register for work 
in the department will be special stu­
dents and not candidates for a diplo­
ma, but will receive a certificate.
GLEE CLUB NOTICE.
The Carnegie Musical Clubs are 
now booking their annual concert 
tour for the season of 1911-1912, and 
are very desirous of making this sea­
son the most successful one in their 
history. The students can help a 
great deal toward this end if they will 
see the manager and give him the 
names of any parties who might be 
interested in an entertainment of this 
sort, in their respective cities. Please 
give this matter your attention as the 
co-operation of the students will aid 
very materially in making this season 
a brilliant season.

FACULTY RESOLUTION.
—o—
At the first meeting of the Faculty 
of the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School for Women on September 15th, 
1911, the members of the Faculty by 
this minute offer expression of their 
genuine sorrow at the sudden death on 
July 27th, of Miss Mary A. Fearnley, 
of the class of 1912, and wish to ex­
press their deep appreciation of the 
character and courage of Miss Fearn­
ley while a student at the Schobl.
A readiness to receive instruction, 
a willingness to co-operate with her 
teacher, a fine appreciation of the aim 
of the teacher for the student, to­
gether with her own systematic ef­
forts and scholarly results, marked 
Miss Fearnley as the unusual student 
Her sense of justice and fairness to 
her fellow students in class, her un­
selfishness and helpfulness, endeared 
her to classmates and teachers alike. 
Her high rank as a student, her sin­
cere womanly character, her possibil­
ities and ambition for future useful­
ness, make her untimely death a cause 
of deep regret.
It is the desire of the Faculty that 
this minute be presented to Miss 
Fearnley’s family and be published in 
the first issue of the Tartan.

THE CLASS CONTEST 
(Continued from Page 1) 
doomed to disappointment, but not­
withstanding that it was agreed the 
sturdy little Jap put up a good fight 
against his much heavier opponent.
The wrestling bouts were as fol­
lows:
Applied Science—
Lightweight — Soph, Swearingen 
(victor). Plebe, Ozakai. 
Middleweight—Soph, Moore. Plebe,
THE TARTAN
dustries, first year men.
The tug-of-war decided the day in 
favor of the Science Sophomores, who 
won the day by one point, the score 
being 7 to 6 in their favor.
The second year Industries fared 
badly, however, the score being 9 to
4 in favor of the first year men.
It looked as if the wild man from 
Borneo had been let loose when the 
captive plebe vice-president, Hobbs, 
was turned loose in the field during
Ayres (victor).
Heavyweight — Soph, Arzwald. 
Plebe, Dougherty (victor).
Applied Industries—
Light Weight—2nd year, Crossut. 
1st year, Patterson (victor).
Middleweight—2nd year, Elkins. 1st 
year, Weller (victor).
Heavyweight—2nd year, Randolph 
(victor). 1st year, Wooster.
The push ball contest was of par­
ticular interest to the spectators.
Thru the instrumentality of Dean 
Leete the push ball was borrowed 
from State College.
The contest was exciting, altho it 
was too long.
The Science Plebes had the better 
of the contest all the way thru, so 
had the Industrial first year men.
The Indian ball event was won by 
the Science Sophomores.
The relay race was won by the In-
the pushball contest. The tatooing 
on Mr. Hobbs’ person appeared to be 
quite a work of art. Hobbs, it ap­
pears, had been held captive for sev­
eral days before the event. The Soph­
omore president, Miller, was a pris­
oner of the Plebes, it appears, altho 
he did not look the worse for his con­
finement.
After all the events were over, re­
freshments were brought on to the 
field and barrels containing cider were 
broached. It was wonderful to note 
how carefully this event was super­
vised by the Seniors. After a grave 
consultation by them, it was decided 
to sample the refreshments before 
they were handed out, with a view 
towards confiscating anything that 
might disagree with the tender stom­
ach of the freshmen, necessitating a 
dose of soothing syrup.
MUSICAL CLUB TRY-OUTS.
All New Men for Glee Club Report 
On Friday from 4 to 6 P. M. and 
for Mandolin Club Between 4 
to 6 on Friday, in Room 
104, A. I. Building.
All new men expecting to try out 
for either the Glee or Mandolin Clubs 
are requested to be present and show 
their ability to play a musical instru­
ment or sing. This appeal is made 
especially to the new men entering 
Tech, and to those old men who were 
unable to be out last year.
The success of the Musical Clubs 
last year will be a great factor in ar­
ranging for a number of out-of-town 
engagements, which, with many pos­
sible local concerts, will assure those 
chosen of an enjoyable season. Mr. 
McDowell and Sg. Scalzo, directors 
of the Clubs last year, have been re­
tained for the coming season, and 
under their expert leadership good re­
sults are assured. For the Mandolin 
Club Sg. Scalzo has obtained a num­
ber of very fine pieces from Europe, 
and Mr. McDowell has some excep­
tionally good material for the Glee 
Club.
MUSICAL CLUBS REHEARSAL. 
All Glee and Mandolin Club Men of 
Last Year and New Men Chosen 
in the Try-Outs Report Sun- ,v 
day, October 1st, at 
2:30 P. M.
Fellows, if we are to make this sea­
son a greater success than last year 
we have got to get off with the gun 
and uphold our reputation for good 
playing and singing by getting at it 
early and rehearsing our music. The 
prospects are fine for a large number 
of good engagements, both in and 
out of town, and it is up to everyone 
to get out and produce results. This 
means you, so come and “GET GIN­
GER INTO IT FELLOWS.”

TECH MEN ON SUMMER IN­
SPECTION TRIP.
Seisel, ’08; McCune, ’09; Glasser, ’10; 
Dougherty, Lockwood and McCall, 
’11, and Abbott, ’13, combined busi­
ness with pleasure this summer, when, 
leaving the house of the Levo Canoe 
Club, in Oakmont, on September 3rd, 
they started down the river in P. 
Croll’s motor boat, bound upon a tour 
of inspection. Croll is a former Tech 
man and has named his boat “The 
Tech.” Abbott, who displayed great 
ingenuity in tightening the clutch 
when it slipped, was appointed assist­
ant to Croll, the engineer. Glasser 
took the wheel.
The first stop was made at the War­
ner City Farms, where a small, but 
very complete and well constructed 
plant for the disposal of sewage by 
septic action was inspected.
The next stop was made at the Bril­
liant Pumping Station. Inspection was 
made of the 12-foot Negley Run sewer, 
and its tap sewer, which is under con­
struction. Wm. Glasser, ’10, of the 
city’s sanitary department, had worked 
upon its design and now explains its 
advantages.
From there the party proceeded to 
the Larimer Avenue concrete span, 
which is under construction. The span 
is 300 feet long, is the longest of its 
type in this country and the second 
longest in the world. The work was 
at such a stage that the party could 
see the details of its construction to, 
the best advantage. They inspected 
the false work, re-inforcement, mix­
ers, pourers, and finally the field ofifce 
of the contractors, The Jos. Casey 
Company. Here they had a long talk 
with the engineers in charge of con­
struction.
The trip gave pleasure and instruc­
tion; and the boys strolled back to 
the boat and lunch, well satisfied for 
having spent a day.

THE COURSE IN 
COMMERCIAL 
ENGINEERING.
—o—
The last edition of the Catalogue 
of the Carnegie Technical Schools, 
contains the curriculum of -the new 
course in Commercial Engineering, 
as well as a general statement of the 
nature and purpose of the work and 
a description of the individual cours­
es. If I may judge from any inter­
views with students, however, there 
are a number of questions which arise 
in their minds not very clearly an­
swered in the catalogue, and I gladly 
take advantage of the invitation of the 
Editors of the Tartan for an article 
on the subjectto make a few supple­
mentary statements.
The name of the new course is, 
perhaps, not altogether happy, in that 
it overemphasizes one side of the work, 
viz.: the commercial side. There are 
in reality three distinguishable parts 
to the course, the commercial work, 
the production or efficiency work, and 
the technical work. The commercial 
work is intended to give a student a 
knowledge of such business and com­
mercial features of modern industrial 
life as are likely to be valuable to him. 
if his future occupation has to do with 
the commercial side of engineering 
practice. It will fit him especially for 
positions in the buying, selling or fi­
nancial branches of engineering.
The work in Production or Effici­
ency Engineering aims to prepare a 
student for positions in the executive 
department of a plant. It deals with 
the internal organization and opera­
tion of a plant from the point of view 
of maximum efficiency. There are 
two reasons why it seems desirable 
to combine the Commercial and the 
Production work in the same course. 
In the first place, in the smaller plants 
almost invariably the same man will 
have to supervise and direct both the 
business operations and the internal 
organization. In the second place, in 
either branch of engineering a more 
general training and a wider range of 
information are desirable than are 
necessary for one who expects to 
work at designing only. In a general 
way it may be said that the Com­
mercial and the Production work are 
distinguished from the design work 
chiefly by the greater amount of con­
tact with men, which they involve, and 
on this human contact rest the need 
and the value of a broader education.
It would be a mistake, however, to 
regard the technical work of the Com­
mercial Engineering Course as a min­
or matter. The course is, after all, 
primarily an Engineering course, and 
not a Commercial course. The tech­
nical work consists of two parts, the 
fundamental course, and the special 
course. The fundamental courses are 
given chiefly in the Plebe and the 
Sophomore years. They include all 
such courses taken by the students 
of other departments, with the ex­
ception of descriptive geometry. The 
special courses are given in the Junior 
and Senior years. Each student se­
lects the department of engineering 
in which he wishes to specialize, and 
during the last two years devotes 
from four to twelve hours a week to 
his chosen option. The result of the
study of the fundamental courses and 
the special courses is a technical train­
ing in the chosen department of en­
gineering which will be by no means 
useless.
I would not seem to maintain for 
a moment that a student who takes a 
particular option in the Commercial 
Engineering Course would have as 
thorough or as detailed training in 
the technical branch of his course as 
he would if he entered the correspond­
ing technical department. A student 
fitting himself for any branch of de­
sign engineering, ought by all means 
to enter the appropriate technical de­
partment. But it can be maintained 
I think, that a student who takes the 
Commercial Engineering Course, ex­
pecting to obtain occupation in which 
the special knowledge gained in that 
course will be useful to him, and who 
finds himself compelled to accept a 
position as a technical or design en­
gineer, will be able to make good 
in the technical work, though with 
more or less extra effort. I have been 
asked several times whether graduates 
of the course in Commercial Engi­
neering will receive degrees when the 
Schools obtain the right to grant de- ' 
grees, and if so, what the degree will 
be. In answer to the first question,
I can give an unqualified answer in 
the affirmative. With respect to the 
second question, I must speak as a 
scribe and not as one having author­
ity. The practice of most engineering 
schools of today is to give its gradu­
ates the degree of Bachelor of Sci­
ence, with a descriptive phrase denot­
ing the special branch of engineering 
studied. If our school follows pre­
cedent, graduates of the department 
of Commercial Engineering will re­
ceive the degree of Bachelor of Sci­
ence in Commercial Engineering, 
j And whatever the degree, they may 
feel assured that they will rank prim­
arily as engineers, able to meet on 
terms of equality other men of the 
same profession.
ALLAN H. WILLETT.
THE NEW PUBLICITY 
BUREAU.
There was much talk last year about 
the starting of a Publicity Bureau 
to handle the getting of advertising 
for all publications and the taking 
charge of the publicity work proper. 
However, nothing was done before 
Commencement and it began to look 
like “next year” when, by dint of 
much labor, enough of the representa­
tives of the student organizations 
were gotten together to put into ex­
istence a temporary organization, the 
same to be effective onl^ until a bet­
ter and more final one could be 
worked out. L. W. Button and W. 
W. Powell were placed in joint charge 
of it and they at once started a cam­
paign to secure advertising for the 
coming season. In this they were very 
successful and the results promise well 
for the completed Bureau.
Now that all are back again the 
question arises as to the appointment 
of a manager for the year. Several 
candidates have presented themselves 
b?it as yet there has been no choice 
made, nor will there be until Friday. 
If there still happens to be someone
who is capable of handling such a 
job, he should make himself known at 
once at the office of the Secretary. 
On the editorial page the Tartan 
makes a few comments on the sub­
ject.
When the final plans are completed 
the Tartan will publish them, hop­
ing that the student body generally 
will take an active interest in this im­
portant departure.
NEXT WEEK IN THE THEATERS
ALVIN—Holbrook Blinn, one of 
the very best of the younger school 
of actors, will appear at the Alvin

8THE TARTAN
JACOB SOFFEL
Republican Candidate for Council
Vindication in Order
THE candidacy of Jacob Soffel will attract thousands of people 
who believe that Mr. Soffel received most outrageous treat­
ment during the recent graft prosecution in the arrest to which 
he was subject. That it was persecution was certified to by the 
Grand Jury wrhich exonerated him from any connection whatever 
with the orgy of iniquity which prevailed in councilmanic circles 
when he wras a member of that body. Jacob Soffel’s record entitles 
him to wide and popular support under ordinary conditions, and 
inasmuch as he has been vindicated by a regularly constituted legal 
body, a clean bill of health is now in order from the voters of the 
city of Pittsburgh.
A clean man morally, Mr. Soffel combines a knowledge of the 
needs of the city in general with an extraordinarily keen business 
acumen. Successful in large affairs, broad in his vision of the rights 
of the taxpayers and in sympathy with the toiling masses from which 
class he has risen by dint of devotion to hard work and superior 
mental equipment, Jacob Soffel deserves to be one of the nine coun- 
cilmen of the city of Pittsburgh, and in order to make him so, his 
friends, w'ho are legion, will work laboriously.
FOOTBALL SEASON OPENS 
NEXT WEEK.
Although the football training sea­
son at Carnegie Tech opened early 
this year, little can yet be said of the 
prospects for the team. No scrim­
mage work has yet been tried by the 
new squad and the men have had little 
chance to display ability in other ways.
An admirable amount of interest has 
been shown by the students and thirty 
men reported for the first days prac­
tice on the field. This number is now 
increased greatly by the new stu­
dents, some of whom show encour­
aging ability and spirit.
Coach Ramsdell has not yet formed 
an opinion of the squad but com­
mends the willingness of the members. 
As the team will not be heavier than 
those of former years, more atten­
tion will be paid to developing a fast 
eleven than to relying upon weight.
Manager ‘‘Jimmie K.” Lamoree has 
completed a good schedule for the 
season and deserves great credit for 
the arrangement of the games. 
Waynesburg, as has been done for 
two years, leads off the home season, 
on October 7. A week later Geneva 
College will be met on the home field. 
Both of these teams are usually even­
ly matched with Carnegie Tech at 
the first of the year, and should prove 
adversaries that need not be despised 
by the green team. Muskingum Col­
lege wrill be played at New Concord, 
Ohio, on October 21. The Grove City 
game w'ill be played this year on the 
home, grounds, while Allegheny Col­
lege will be met at Meadville. An­
other out-of-town game will be with 
Western Reserve at Cleveland on No­
vember 18. Athletic relations be­
tween the University and the Plaid 
schools have been of the best for sev­
eral years, and our men hope to show 
them that our light team is more 
than a match for them on the grid­
iron.
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is 
a new football foe for a Pittsburgh 
college, although we have met them 
before in hockey. The New Yorkers 
should prove a strong drawing card 
for the management, as a large num­
ber of the alumni of the Troy school 
reside in this vicinity. Some students 
may be disappointed because the 
Thanksgiving Day game will take 
place in Columbus, but Pittsburgh in­
terest always centers around the Pitt- 
State game on that day, and it is bet­
ter to establish a good impression in 
the Ohio capital than to play before 
a small, but loyal, crowd at home.
The schedule in full is as follows:
Oct. 7—Waynesburg College, at 
home.
Oct. 14—Geneva College, at home.
Oct. 21—Muskingum College at 
New Concord, O.
Oct. 28—Grove City College, at 
home.
Nov. 4—Allegheny College, at Mead­
ville, Pa.
Nov. 11—Westminster College, at

NEW BUILDING FOR 
APPLIED DESIGN
Work to Start Soon.
Along last Spring the old steam 
shovel and its helpers, the Tech Lim­
ited and the Woodlawn Local, started 
to eat away the hill back of the pres­
ent Industries Building and, during 
the months of rest and enjoyment for 
us, the work has been rapidly pushed 
forward, so that now it is expected 
that the site for the new buildings 
for the School of Applied Design will 
be ready for the commencement of 
the building operations some time 
next month. It has been an under­
taking of magnitude to prepare the 
sites for the future buildings, as it 
necessitated the removal of some six 
acres of earth to an average depth of 
twelve feet. The material so obtained 
has been taken by the above men­
tioned helpers and used to fill the 
ravine that exists, or more properly, 
existed, where the new stadium is to 
be located.
The new home of the Architects 
will have a very imposing location, as 
it is to stand at the head of the campus 
and will be approached through a 
large open court. The dimensions 
are to be approximately 260 feet long 
by 110 feet wide, and the cost will 
be somewhere in the neighborhood of 
$800,000. The first floor will contain 
an auditorium for lectures, plays, con­
certs, etc., and will also contain a 
working museum, a students’ art gal­
lery and an exhibition room for de­
corative art, as well as for other per­
manent exhibitions of students’ work. 
The second, and third floors will be 
devoted to drafting rooms, labora­
tories, class rooms, and ateliers. The 
studios will be at the top of the build­
ing, being lighted from above. The 
building will have three stories, a 
mezzanine and a high basement. The 
entrance will open upon a vestibule 
40 feet square by 50 feet high. The 
rear of the vestibule will lead up a 
few steps into an atrium, which is 
a long vaulted stone room 25 feet 
wide, 30 feet long, and running the 
entire length of the building. This 
is intended as concourse for the stu­
dents. Architecturally this is to be 
the most elaborate building of the 
group.
It will be remembered that Mr. Car­
negie gave $3,800,000 recently for ex­
tensions, and this is the first building 
to be constructed. The others are 
to follow.
Speaking of scrap-books—did you 
ever see the big libraries, of these 
volumes owned by literary and pro­
fessional men and business firms of 
Pittsburgh. They are compiled by
