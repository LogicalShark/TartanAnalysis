MR. ADVERTISER
Do you really know the advertising 
value of a school paper? Do you 
realize that Carnegie Tech is the larg­
est technical school in the United 
States—not going to be any more, but 
IS? Do you realize that 2500 students 
are enrolled here—enough to make a 
good sized town with no children or 
old people? Do you know that The 
Tartan is its only student paper and 
appears 36 times during the school 
year? Now, Mr. Advertiser, don’t you 
think it would pay to let these young 
money spenders (three-fourths are 
men) know what you have to sell? For

4THE TARTAN
WHITE FRIARS HOLD MEETING.
The White Friars held the first business meeting 
of the season in the' A. & J. Building Saturday night. 
Enough members were present to have a quorum, and 
the most important business of the evening was the 
election of officers for the coming season. Mr. Ed- 
mundson, the Stage Director of the Club, was present 
and spoke of the work to be done and of what some 
of the more important problems the management will 
have to solve to make this year's production a suc­
cess. Steen, last year’s business manager, made a 
statement of the finances of the Club which showed 
a debt from the performances of “His Highness, 
the Chef”—all of the money being lost on the out 
of town trips. The old Board of Governors held their 
last meeting and elected George, Tishlarich, Weldon, 
Moss, and Rose to the undergraduate membership 
of the Club in addition to Ericson, Brown, James, 
Fleming, Keally and Oliver who were elected last 
June.
The .egular election of officers for the ensuing year 
resulted as follows:
President, M. M. Steen; First Vice-president, E.
D. James; Second Vice-president, Alan Bright; Treas­
urer, F. X. Keally; Secretary, Oscar Bieler; Busi­
ness Manager, D. D. Mitchell; Stage Director, W. B. 
Edmundson; Musical Director, W. McD. Dorringkm; 
Board of Governors, Rigaumonit, Rodgers, Summers, 
Moss, and Bieler.
M. M. C. S. CHRISTMAS OPERETTA.
The students of the M. M. C. S. have been busy 
for the past few months rehearsing the operetta 
which will be presented in the Gymnasium of the 
Woman’s School. The music and book are the work 
of Miss Elizabeth R. Stoner, who has charge of the 
dramatics as well as the physical culture work done 
in the schools. Costumes for the piece have been 
made in the dressmaking and costume design depart­
ments by the students. The entire company is com­
posed of 42 of the girls of the school who have en­
tered well into the spirit of the undertaking. The 
scenic effects were planned and the scenery painted 
by Mr. Russell Hewlett of the School of Applied De­
sign.
The play deals with Christmas happenings in con­
nection with the festivities of the season in an Eng­
lish family of the 17th Century. The story of the 
play is well set forth in a prologue spoken before 
the rise of the curtain. Amid the preparations for 
the Christmas day, two children fall asleep and 
dream the adventures portrayed in the next two 
acts; visits to the courts of ,St. Valentine and St. 
Nicholas. The closing act takes place in the same 
scene as the first, and is a complete reproduction of 
life at the period.
Throughout the entire piece are original and 
catchy songs and dances, the work of Miss Stoner. 
The language and style of the time is well done in
the book, and the entire work is as clever an oper­
etta as the writer has ever seen. A few of the fine 
old English and French Christmas carols are intro­
duced with fine effect in the first and last acts. A 
fool enlivens and garnishes the action throughout 
with his wit and furnishes an excellent opportunity 
for a bit of character work.
Two performances will be given: Friday after­
noon and Saturday night, both in the Girls’ Gymna­
sium. For the evening performance, tickets will be 
sold for 50 cents.
SOPHOMORES BADLY FOOLED.
A feeling of suppressed excitement seemed to per­
vade the air all of last Friday. It was the talk of 
the Sophomore camp -that the Plebe banquet was to 
happen on that night, and consequently many meet­
ings and conferences were held to discuss the affair. 
After a hot pow-wow in which the Scotchman advo­
cated immediate abduction as the best plan of action 
it was decided how the deed was to be done. The 
Plebe president would be nabbed right before the 
very eyes of his class mates and hurried away in 
an automobile to be held captive until the Friday 
night banquet had taken place. Accordingly, the 
kidnapping posse headed by the brawney Scott wait­
ed in the halls of the Science building, while the 
arch-kidnappers were on Woodlawn Avenue in the 
machine.
The psychological moment having arrived, wit­
nessed a fierce struggle with much hugging on the 
part of a few Plebes, and much sliding on the part 
of the Plebe. Down the stairs they went and out 
of the copper doors from which the handles had 
been taken to foil pursuers, and across the .board way 
between the building and the street went the running 
fight. In passing the Architectural Department, the 
Plebes there fell out of the door just too late to catch 
the machine making off in the direction of Forbes 
Street. The few remaining Sophomores glanced 
about to see the effect of the capture on the Plebes, 
and were amazed to find them doubled up with 
laughter, and then the truth began to dawn; the 
banquet had been postponed!
“THISTLE” BOARD MEET.
The first meeting of the “Thistle” Board was held 
in Room 118, of the A. & J. Building, Thursday night. 
Owing to the fact that the representatives from two 
of the classes were not present, the general election 
were postponed until the next meeting. All repre­
sentatives from the M. M. C. S. were present and 
elected Miss Mary Hartman, of the Day School, as 
assistant editor-in-chief. Many plans were discussed 
as to the character of the volume and the manner 
in which it shall be gotten up. At the next meeting, 
the size of the pages will be decided and announced 
so that work may be begun on the drawings during 
the Christmas holidays. The second meeting took 
place last night.

THE TARTAN5
HOCKEY
First Game of the Season Saturday Night
EVERYBODY OUT FOR THE PITT GAME
The Local intercollegiate Hockey season is to be 
inaugurated Saturday evening at Duquesne Gardens, 
Tech and the University of Pittsburgh being sched­
uled to start the pack moving. This will also be the 
first game in the new league, which is comprised of 
Tech, State, and Pitt. It is hoped that a large body 
of the faithful will turn out to help Captain Dorn- 
berger and his men to a successful start, a very nec­
essary thing in every league race. To the winner 
of this league race goes the State Championship. 
Come out and show that you have a desire for Tech 
to win this honor. It is up to you just as much as 
it is up to the men on the team.
The squad has received its first cut, the following 
men being retained: —
Captain Dornberger.
Charles,
Bright,
Mason,
Minnemeyer,
Hittner,
Lowe,
Engstrom,
Harmer,
Stevenson,
Flood,
McCracken.
It will be seen from the above list that six of laat 
year’s team are out trying for positions, a thing that 
argues well for our success. Several of the new men 
have had considerable experience in playing the game 
and they should materially strengthen the team. 
Tech has always done well on the ice and this year 
the team should prove no exception, promising as it 
does to eclipse any of our teams in the past. There 
is no earthly reason why, with the proper support 
from the student body, we should not capture the 
State championship and give a mighty good account
of ourselves in our games with the various Eastern 
colleges that we are to meet during the season. The 
one thing is certain, that we can look forward to 
having a team that is a team. The rest of the respon­
sibility rests with the student body. It is up to you 
to come out and show the, spirit that was shown dur­
ing the foot-ball season just past. Come out in full 
force and ROOT.
The schedule for the coming holidays calls for the 
following games:
December 18th—Tech-Pitt.
December 25th—Tech-State.
December 28th—Tech-Yale.
January 1st—State-Pitt.
This assures the Hockey lovers plenty of good 
Hockey with which to digest their Christmas dinner. 
All of the games will begin at 8.15 P. M. After each 
game there will be a good hour of skating.
Manager Robinson announces that there will prob­
ably be a trip to Cleveland for a three-game series 
with Rennselaer. The exact date can not be an­
nounced as it has not been definitely decided upon by 
the managers. It will be remembered the team took 
a very successful trip to Cleveland last year.
Manager Robinson has tickets for. all of the com­
ing games and every student should get their tickets 
from him. Make an effort and come out. Give the 
team a good send off. You owe it to yourself.
I hereby surrender my loan of $.
to the Carnegie Tech Athletic Association, 
making it non-collectable.

6THE TARTAN
THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.
By B. J. P., 1913.
Christmas time has come once more! As the holi­
days approach and the sombre city streets begin to 
take on a more attractive and fresher look, the busy 
throngs hasten with all possible speed from one gaily 
bedecked store to another—each of which is trying 
to outdo its rivals in the gorgeousness of its displays 
—and we seem to see on the face of each one we pass, 
a different expression from that which for eleven 
months of the year hides the feelings of man and 
which, at this time, gives place to the much pleas­
anter and happier one of the Christmas season.
There is a subtle change in the very air about us 
at this season, which seems to be like “the voice of 
one crying in the wilderness,” which tells us of the 
coming of the birthday of the King of Kings. The 
shops are dressed in their finest appointments and 
everywhere we see the green holly, the mistletoe, 
and the sweet scented evergreen trees. The children 
are out in force, from the babe in its mother’s arms 
to the big brother, home from college, and all are 
happy, good natured, and seemingly filled with the 
spirit of the season.
Now is the time of the year to forget sorrow and 
the continual strife of the business world, and move 
into that better and happier land of the merry 
Christmas time. It is a time to remember our loved 
ones at home and away, and to make an offering to 
all these in honor of Him Who gave His very life 
that the children of man might be happy.
There is a new activity noticeable in every home 
and many secrets and much mystery in the air. Gifts 
are smuggled into the house and hastily concealed, 
to be displayed only when the long-looked-for day has 
arrived. Everyone is happy, or is trying to appear 
so at any rate, for is not this the happiest time of 
the whole long year? Yes, and at the same time the 
saddest, for who is there who can know a really 
happy time in this world of strife, and who is there 
that even at the merriest occasions does not picture 
in his mind similar ones in the past when there were 
present parents, children, sweethearts, wives, and 
husbands, who have gone before them into the Land 
of the Great Unknown?
Ah! It is truly a sad festival that these celebrate, 
even when there are little ones to comfort and love 
them. There is always a vacant chair that no one, 
no matter how loving or kind or affectionate, can ever 
fill. What is it after all that moves the world? Is 
it love of money, or power or position? Or is it the 
love we bear for our own, for those who are nearest 
and dearest to our hearts, be they living in this world 
or the next? Sentiment is the strongest factor for 
good in the world today and it is sentiment that does 
more than anything else to keep us on the narrow 
path. It is the thought that there is Someone at 
home, who will look for us after the long day, and 
welcome us to the fireside—Someone, who will know 
instinctively when we come to them at eventide, just 
what we have suffered and borne during the long,
hard day that they might be spared some of the hard­
ships of life.
It is this that makes the holiday season hard for 
those who have lost their loved ones, and who have 
none to comfort, or to be comforted. Then there is 
the man who has loved ones, but who is by reason of 
necessity separated from them. To him it will be a 
dreary day that will come on the birthday of our 
Savior. There may be a little village somewhere in 
a distant state or country where a family will be 
looking for the son, who will never return in this 
life, or there may be little ones longing to see their 
“daddy” again. To the man, who thinks of this 
side of the Christmas season, it will be a far from 
merry day. He will see with new eyes the little ones 
of others and will think of the poor, who may be just 
as loving as himself, but who are unable to give 
their children what their more fortunate neighbors 
can. At this time, when the rich are spending the 
most and enjoying themselves to the fullest, there 
are in every city, thousands who are at this time 
poorest and to whom the thought of the holidays 
brings only a feeling of dread and regret. They will 
know no happiness who have not the necessities of 
life, much less any of the luxuries, theirs will be a 
hard cross to bear at this time, but even as it is hard, 
so in proportion will be the reward that will be theirs 
in eternity.
THE DRAFTSMAN.
Over an old warped drawing board 
The sad-eyed draftsman stands,
The drudge a hungry man is he,
With dirty, unwashed hands,
And the muscles of his lean, lank arms 
Are soft as rubber bands.
Day in, day out from 8 to 5,
You can hear his rubber scrape; 
One wonders how he can contrive
So many bulls to make,
As plans he draws of many floors 
With many a rank mistake.
He eats, he drinks, he talks, he sleeps 
From weary day to day;
Each morning sees some work begun, 
Each Saturday comes his pay. 
Something attempted, nothing done,
He works till his hair turns gray.
Thanks, thanks to thee my worthy friend 
For the lesson thou hast taught,
For if your life’s at a drawing board 
Your time will be spent for naught.
Click! Click!
Subbubs—It’s simply great to wake up in the morn­
ing and hear the leaves whispering outside your win­
dow.
Cityman—It’s all right to hear the leaves whisper, 
but I never could stand hearing the grass mown.— 
Boston Transcript.

FIRST YEAR INDUSTRIALS
The first meeting of the First Year Night Indus­
trials was held on Friday evening, December 3rd, 
1909, in the Assembly Hall. President G. C. Weiss of 
the Draftsmen’s Club presided and called the meeting 
to order. After a few words of an explanatory char­
acter, Mr. Weiss introduced Mr. Morris of the Faculty, 
who spoke on the value of class organization. Elec­
tion of officers followed and resulted in the election 
of the following: President, J. E. McCloskey; Vice 
President, C. Wilson; Secretary, R: Colt; Treasurer, 
A. J. Willis; Historian and Tartan Representative, B.

EDITORIAL
NOTICE.
This issue of “The Tartan” is being distributed free. 
The Schools have bought up the entire edition and 
chosen this means of disposing of it, so that the rec­
ommendation on the financial standing of the Ath­
letic Association will be sure of reaching every male 
student in the .Schools. We would have it understood 
that this arrangement applies to this issue only, 
and that we go back to cash sales with the next 
issue.
AN APOLOGY.
Last week we had occasion to deplore the election 
of Manager Scott of the foot-ball team. In doing 
so, we thought our information was sufficiently un­
biased to be reliable, but we have learned since that 
such was not the case. Our attention was called to 
the true state of affairs by the Board of Control, and 
a proper explanation and apology was made Manager 
Scott before that body as soon as sufficient evidence 
was furnished to prove our statements to be incor­
rect. We make this in the nature of the same ex­
planation and apology made to him then, as we would 
do in any case where we are shown to be at fault.
“The Case- Tech” of the Case School of Applied 
Science reprints part of our editorial tff several weeks
ago, headed “Spirit,” with the comment that it will 
apply to conditions at most institutions. It is at 
least consoling to know that our trouble is not alone 
caused by our extreme youth.
THE DIRECTOR’S SUGGESTED RE-ORGANIZA­
TION OF ATHLETICS.
Tne article appearing on the first page in reference 
to the Athletic situation, is in the most part self- 
evident. Since the Board of Control have asked the 
help of the Director in solving the complicated sit­
uation, and this statement is his solution, they have 
nothing to do but to accept it as it stands, if for no 
other reason than they asked for it. On the other 
hand it has so much in its favor that we have no 
hesitency in saying it should be accepted whether 
it was originally requested or not. It is the only way 
out of the complication we see.
£[1 as it stands is made necessary to prevent an­
other such situation as exists at the present time. It 
merely puts the business on a cash basis and makes 
it impossible for any more bills being run, and there­
by endangering the credit and good name of the As­
sociation as well as that of the Schools. The pen­
alty provided for its violation is only just and proper.
^2 does not mean that there shall be no intercol­
legiate base-ball and foot-ball. Manager Keally of 
the base-ball team states that he needs $305 to cover 
the guarantees he musit sign in order to be sure of 
having the schedule. Manager Scott, of the foot­
ball team gives $450 as the amount he needs, which 
totals $755. It is up to the Board of Control to get 
this money by January 15th. It means intercollegiate 
athletics or no intercollegiate athletics. The Board 
has two sources from which it may be possible to ob­
tain money; the student body and loans from outside 
sources. Outside loans in this case are a very unde­
pendable quantity for the reason that no approved 
security can be put back of them, which leaves the 
student body the ones to decide the question. If 
755 men here thing enough of the intercollegiate ath­
letics (outside of Hockey, which is practically fi­
nanced by the Duquesne Gardens) to have it con­
tinued, each wrill have to think just one dollar’s worth 
to make it possible.
Ç3 provides for the best system being adopted 
to pay the bills, and to over-see the expenses that 
could be possibly provided. A voucher given by the 
Supervisor of Athletics to a manager of a team is 
a check on the bank acting as Treasurer, and he 
presents it to get his cash to pay the bill. By hav­
ing the same bank that takes on the notes act in this 
capacity, it ought not to be necessary to pay extra 
for their services as Treasurer.
ç4.*We think that in recommending a man for

and the actual responsibility of the condition of the

to concentrate managerial power, and it is the only 
paragraph about which we have any doubts. We 
hope that such a man can be found to serve under 
the provisions. If he can, and is a big, and broad 
enough man for the job, all will be to the good. The 
Board under the provisions, will doubtless conclude 
that so little of his time can be spent here, that 
most of the duties previously meant for him must 
be given to the Supervisor of Athletics. If the power 
of the managers to make contracts and spend money 
is not centralized, we are back where we started 
from. Our only doubts are that the graduate mana­
ger as proposed will not be on the job enough to 
assume the necessary responsibility. It is for this 
reason we suggest the Board will cover the point in 
approving a man for the Supervisor of Athletics.
^[6 is self-explanatory and is the best thing we 
see to do under the circumstances.
^7. For some time past we have been advocating 
the surrender of these notes. We advocate it yet. 
The recommendation as expressed covers the cases 
in which our plan fails, and to make it effective the 
best way might be to have the Board of Control 
write each holder of a' note a letter asking for the 
extension of time. In cases where the complete sur­
render of the note is inconvenient to its holder, 
this plan will surely meet with favor, but there is 
nothing to stop a man from making the complete 
surrender if able.
means that the Schools shall at once pay up 
the grading that has been dQne to the top field in ad­
vance of the time when it was necessary to have 
it done to provide for the extension of the buildings, 
as it is a necessary item in the plan of the com­
pleted Schools. The work was done ahead of time 
and contracted for by the Association to fill in 
“Tech” field.
By making a careful study of the situation and 
the recommendation here submitted to the student 
body for consideration, we think it is a good way out 
of the difficulty. We think it is the only way. The 
Director has bought up this issue of “The Tartan” 
for the purpose of putting it in the hands of all its 
male students. The Board of Control meet this week, 
probably Friday, to take action. In the meantime all 
classes must meet, discuss the situation fully, and 
instruct their representative what to do. We earn­
estly hope and recommend that such instruction will
be along the lines mentioned above in connection 
with each of the articles.
AN OLD NURSERY CHRISTMAS CAROL.
(Wriitten from memory by R. A. W.)
One Christmas Eve’ when Santa came to a certain 
house
To fill the children’s stockings there he found a 
little mouse.
“A Merry Christmas, little friend,” said Santa good 
and kind,
“The same to you, sir,” said the mouse, “I thought 
you wouldn’t mind
If I should stay awake tonight and watch you for 
awhile.”
“You're very welcome, little mouse,” said Santa with 
a smile.
And then he filled the stockings up before the mouse 
could wink,
From top to toe, from toe to top, there was not left 
a chink.
Now they won’t hold another thing, said Santa Claus 
with pride.
The mousie chuckled to himself, then softly he re­
plied:
“’Tis not polite to contradict, your pardon I 
implore,
But in the fulest stocking there,I could put one 
thing more.”
“Ha, ha!” laughed Santa, “Silly mouse, don't 1 know 
how to pack?
By filling stockings all these years, I should have 
learned the knack.”
And then he took a stocking down from where it 
hung so high,
And said, “Now put :in one thing more, I give you 
leave to try.”
The mousie gave a sly old wink, then up he softly 
stole
Right to the stocking’s crowded toe, and gnawed a 
little hole.
“Now, if you please, dear Santa Claus, I’ve put in one 
thing more,
For you will own that little hole was not in there 
before.”

The week before Christmas had been fearfully cold 
and the newsboy who stood on one of the principal 
streets of our city had suffered more than ever. He 
had no overcoat and the wind seemed to chill his 
very blood. But he was always cheerful, for he could 
not afford to complain when the poor Salvation Sister 
across the street sat all day holding out the little 
wooaen turkey to be filled with alms. No one seemed 
to notice her silent appeal, yet she was always pleas­
ant. The boy spoke to her one day and the next morn­
ing the Sister smiled. These two became well ac­
quainted in the course of two days and each retailed 
his history.
The Sister had the usual history of being saved by 
the Army when about to give up, and was wrapped 
heart and soul in helping less fortunate people. She 
was so sorry that rich people did not give more money 
to her cause.
The boy had been an orphan for years and just 
made enough money to keep himself in food and 
clothing. He had at last saved enough to get himself 
a Christmas present. But when he saw the pleading 
look of the Sister he wavered and thought that per­
haps he was not so cold after all.
The next day was the coldest of the week and the 
boy thought that he needed the coat as much as 
anyone. Then the Sister smiled her pleading smile 
and the boy capitulated. He dropped the money into
her box and was warmed all day by the thought of 
the grateful face of the Sister.
The cast of “The Triumph of St. Nicolas” has done 
wonderfully well this week, and deserved unlimited 
credit in getting the play ready for production. It 
can truly be said that the performance will be worth 
the expense and trouble of those interested in it. The 
Club wishes to take this opportunity to thank those 
who have been so kind as to make donations of any 
kind, and to say that everything done has been fully 
appreciated.
Thursday evening the night students will be invited 
to attend the dress rehearsal; Friday afternoon the 
play will be given for the school, and Saturday even­
ing fifty cents admission will be charged for any­
one wishing to see the play. It will be held in the 
gymnasium of the M. M. C. S. at eight o’clock, and 
all are urged to come.
The Juniors have been busy lately. Members for 
the “Thistle” have been elected, and now the class 
is at work on the prcim
The children sat in perfect silence, their little hands 
folded and their big eyes staring right at me. I told 
them about the Shepherd Psalm and showed them a 
picture of the Shepherd with his sheep following him 
and with one little lamb in his arms. I led up to 
what I considered a culminating point, when I said 
softly, “And do you know, dear children, we are all 
little sheep and God is our Shepherd.” Twenty heads 
nodded enthusiastically and twenty faces beamed on 
me. The bell rang and as the children passed out,

I felt I had done my full duty as a Sunday School 
teacher. On my way home, I overheard some one 
ask one of my pupils what his teacher had said. “She 
said,” replied the little one confidently, “that we were 
all little pigs.”
Dr. Martin—“Miss Borland, what makes you blush?”
Miss Borland—-“! ! ? ? ? Oh,—my heart!”
Miss Nickerson (in housekeeping)—“We expire and

Miss Swickard—“What is a vacuum? Is my head

DRAFTSMEN’S CLUB.O
The basket ball team of the Draftsmen’s Club 
promises to be one of the best in the city as there 
is a lot of good material in the class. The Draftsmen 
are now arranging to get up a league, which will in­
clude teams from all the night classes in the A. and 
J. school. The Dean is trying to arrange for the use 
of one of the rooms in the building for practice.
All Draftsmen should be present at the class meet­
ing in the Assembly Hall next Friday night at 9:30. 
A visit to the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School is 
contemplated. Come out, fellows, as there “is a good 
time coming” for all who are “on deck” when school 
closes for the holidays.
AERO CLUB HOLD MEETING.
The question of whether there was sufficient inter- 
ets in aeronautics among the student body to warrant 
the formation of a club devoted exclusively to it, 
was answered in the affirmative when nearly sev­
enty-five men met on Thursday and elected officers. 
There are but a few of these clubs among the col­
leges and universities of the country and the inter­
est shown last week speaks well for the interests of 
Carnegie Tech. The following officers^ were elected: 
Prsident—W. J. Vance; vice-president, Duff; sec­
retary and treasurer, Blair; Tartan representative, 
Butler.
More definite plans will be made after the Holidays.
1913 NIGHT SMOKER.
The class of 1913 Applied Science Night, have ar­
ranged to give a smoker for the benefit of the Ath­
letic Association in the Science Building on Friday 
night. Among other features will be several num­
bers by the Glee and Mandolin Clubs.

SIGN PAINTERS’ SMOKER.
The Night Sign Painters held the first smoker of 
the season early in the month. Many of the faculty 
of the Night School and graduates from that de­
partment were present. Among the clever features 
of the evening was the juggling and slight-of-hand 
work of Peter Miller. Mr. Otterson entertained the 
crowd with stories and tales relating to the craft, 
and Silas Stone, a vaudeville performer, who is 
with the class this year, gave a comedy sketch en­
titled, “Ain’t You Listenin’.” Messrs. Morris, Pfouts, 
Calderwood, Taylor, Hamilton, and Murray varied 
the program with speeches, after which Edgar Heu- 
ber did some good rapid sketching. The Broken 
Shutter Quartette made a hit with their selections 
and parodies, and the boxing matches were called. 
Dadt and Gensburg had a set-to ending in a draw, and 
Irwin knocked Grier out in the third. The last 
match on the program was postponed owing to a dis­
agreement on the part of the officials. The evening 
was brought to a close with a luncheon. Altogther 
a delightful time was spent.

MHO CLUB.
The meeting of the Mho Club last Wednesday 
evening was the most interesting and enjoyable yet 
had.
A paper on “Arc Lamps and Lighting,” prepared 
by Messrs. Wallace and Waxman and illustrated on 
a mirrorscope by Waxman. This was followed with 
a paper by Mr. Culbertson on “The Single System,” 
illustrated with lantern slides and photographs. This 
is the first time that students have read papers before 
the Club and marks a great advance in the scope 
of the organization. The Club has offered a prize 
for the best paper delivered during the year.
Prof. Wurts urged that the discussion of the papers 
was quité as important as their preparation and de­
liverance, and to stimulate interest along this line 
offered a prize for the best discussion of any paper 
during the year.
After further business the meeting adjourned to 
enjoy the splendid lunch proivded by Prof. Wurts as 
a housewarming for the new Club room which he 
has fitted up for use. The Professor presented to 
•each member a corn-cob pipe, bearing the emblem of 
the Club, as a souvenir of the occasion. After the 
lunch the Club room was dedicated with smokes, 
songs and cheers. The “Song of the Dynamo” made 
quite a hit and was followed by Dyer and Porter’s 
famous rendition of “Are there any more at home like 
Mary?”
At eleven o’clock, all parted voting Prof. Wurts a 
delightful host. It wras indeed a “red letter” night 
in the history of the Club, and has increased pride 
in the Club, the Department and the School.
CLASS “C.”

Spandau’s troubles last week were numerous. In 
the first place he had great trouble persuading Mr. 
Bergey that he was a mathematician. His definition 
of a straight line goes Noah Webster one better. A 
straight line is a point whose direction is the same 
throughout. This fertile imagination served him in 
good stead by furnishing some splendid excuses for 
appearing without the red cap. His grandmother 
died (?) so he had to wear a dip to the funeral, the 
other stock excuses of the baseball fan!
Several Applied Design men were elected to the 
White Friars last Saturday night. These were Moss, 
Rose, Weldon and Tischlarich.
The abommable weather of last week cannot be 
said to have caused the worried look on the architects’ 
faces. No—it was Mr. Bergey’s inexhaustible supply 
of math, exams!
Mitchell was appointed a member of the club house 
committee by the day classes, and Rigaumont by the 
night. Pete Sterling was appointed to the Junior 
Prom. Committee.
Niccls will be the editor-in-chief of the Thistle for 
this year. Moss and Mitchell are the other two rep­
resentatives on the board from this school.

The old temperance motto, “Never take a drop too 
much,” applies very forcibly to those who have adop­
ted the somewhat elevating, yet hazardous avocation 
of an aeronaut. The principal essentials for success 
are: A thorough knowledge of what you are about
to perform, to be possessed of a steady nerve and a 
cool head under the most trying circumstances, quick, 
watchful and ready to act and operate, and to do just 
the right thing at the proper moment, as the slight­
est hesitation and mistake may cost you your life.
Having overhauled your parachute cloth and cords 
before the ascent, you (he or she, as the case may 
be, as some of the gentler sex now perform with 
great success) sit on the trapeze, or rope sling, and 
as the word is given, the balloon is let go, and up you 
rise. The first objects that attract the aeronaut’s 
attention are the ring of spectators around the in­
flating arena, and the buildings in the park where 
the ascent is made, but as you are being carried 
rapidly upwards, like the rising in a fast traveling 
elevator, the country around expands itself to view, 
the ground beneath running away like the sensation 
experienced when standing on the platform at the. 
rear of a fast moving train, and it is also a peculiar 
fact .that one of the most conspicuous objects seen

from a few thousand feet up is a line of railway, 
which stretches like a black serpent across the coun­
try.
A magnificent panorama is presented to view, the 
landscape for miles around lays itself out like a 
gigantic map, streets and villages blend themselves 
into a huge real estate plan. At this height (about
3,000 to 4,000 ft.), assuming that the aeronaut has as­
cended with a hot air balloon (the usual method for 
parachuting), the balloon stops ascending. A perfect 
feeling of contentment and safety assures the mind, 
and the aeronaut is enabled to glance around at the 
surrounding country and enjoy the scenery to the 
full, observe any prominent landmarks, and get an 
idea of where he is likely to land. All is silence at 
this height, no dizziness is experienced, nor is it the 
same sensation as when looking from a lofty build­
ing; but soon a rustling of your parachute cloth is 
heard overhead, it tells you the balloon is cooling and 
descending, and seeing you are over a fairly clear 
spot, you prepare to drop.
Glancing up at your parachute to see if the cords 
are disentangled, you grasp your trapeze rope by one 
hand, your cutaway line with the. other, cross your 
legs around your trapeze bar, collect your thoughts, 
and pull the knife. At once the wind rushes past you, 
the trapeze seems not to hold your weight, you fall 
as if pushed, unprepared, from a high stage into the 
water at the baths. You look overhead to see the 
parachute open. The parachute cloth is dropping in a 
bundle to reach you as it were, but before it doe*, 
your weight tells and pulls the cords straight, the 
wind catches under the cloth of your canopy, you 
hav.e a few anxious moments as it slowly unfolds 
like a huge umbrella and with a slight tug (as if a 
fish were running away with your fishing line) you 
are supported like a feather, and you experience a 
feeling of satisfaction and safety. Down you float 
to terra firma like a bird on outstretched wings, and 
if it is a calm day, your descent is almost vertical 
at the rate of 8 to 10 ft. a second. When nearing the 
ground the earth seems to rush up to meet you, and 
what, at a height of a thousand feet seemed a small 
box in an allotment, turns out now to be a good sized 
house. You reach the ground as if in a free drop 
from a height of about 4 ft.
The most exciting part of parachuting is making 
a good landing, especially where trees or buildings 
are about, but with a little experience you soon learn 
to manipulate the parachute cords, and thus cave 
or direct the canopy to bear you in the direction re­
quired.—Popular Mechanics.
In Astronomy.
Student—‘Has the moon regular habits?” 
Professor (absentmindedly)—“No, once a month 
it goes into the Milky Ways, gets full, and doesn’t 
go until it’s last quarter has disappeared.”—The 
Lampoon.
