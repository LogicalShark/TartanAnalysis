SEVEN MEN CALLED 
BY TAU BETA PI
With the presentation of the Alpha 
Tau stunt contest cup to the Machine 
Production Department, an enjoyable 
evening of prizes and surprises was 
brought to a close at the Industries 
Smoker, in the Union" last Saturday 
night.
About 250 men attended the affair, 
including a goodly number of the fac­
ulty and alumni. The All-Industries 
Orchestra opened the ceremonies 
with a couple of the latest selections, 
and furnished more harmony during 
the Lige Conley movie comedy that 
followed. Dick Hawke was on deck 
all evening, leading cheers for every­
thing and everyone in Industries from 
Dean Morris to the nightwatchman.
In a spirited election, Mike Kall­
felz, of Machine Production, and Pi 
Kappa Alpha fraternity, was elected 
the most Representative Carnegie 
Senior in Industries. His photograph 
will grace The Thistle. Dean Mor­
ris, "the best beloved man in Car­
negie,” called the following as Alpha 
Tau pledges: L. Roy Allen, Nathan
Leebon, Orville H. Martin, and K. 
N. Wyant, all Building Constructors.
The stunt contest brought forth 
some splendid productions, all so good 
that a real task faced the judges, 
Mr. Lawler of the Industries faculty, 
and Messrs. Wagner and Mollenauer, 
Arts School students, in choosing the 
winner. Judging from the applause, 
the Machine Productionists, present­
ing a snappy skit in verse explaining 
scenes from their trade as illustrated 
in a large book, was certainly the 
popular choice.
As an added feature, Chris Bueke- 
ma of the P. F. Department awarded 
the inter-fraternity swimming cup 
to Theta XI fraternity.
Plenty of smokes, doughnuts, and 
punch, kept the crowd in condition 
for the strenuous laughter and ap­
plause that they could not suppress, 
and it 1s quite certain that all who 
attended Saturday’s affair will be on 
hand next year.

Senior Hats to be Sold 
After Easter Vacation
The Senior Hat Committee-has yet 
to sell about one hundred hats be­
fore their duties for the year are 
completed’. Hats were placed on sale 
last fall during registration and even 
though conditions were favorable for 
a record sale, only fifty per cent of 
the seniors bought hats. Some men 
from last year used the same hat 
that they bought last spring, other 
seniors were not even interested eh- 
ough to wear a hat distinctive of 
their position on the campus. There­
fore, the committee is in bad straits 
and can be brought out only by 
whole-hearted support of the entire 
senior class.
After Easter there is going to be an 
intense sale of senior hats and every 
senior is asked to bring back to 
school the price of a new spring hat. 
Notices will be on the campus and 
in The Tartan stating when and 
where these hats may be purchased. 
The committee’s slogan is: Every 
Senior wearing a Senior Hat every 
day from Easter until Commence­
ment.
Women Stodents Wtll Take
Actton Agatnst Pobltc Smoktng
A written protest against Carnegie 
women smoking in public caused the 
matter to be brought to their imme­
diate attention at a mass meeting at­
tended by 494 women out of the ap­
proximate 725 enrolled at the institu­
tion, at which a questionnaire was 
presented. The results of the ans­
wers showed that only four per cent 
of the 494 women smoked regularly 
and 67 per cent stated that they 
never smoked.
In reply to the other questions 
from one to three per cent did not 
answer. The majority answered as 
follows: 60 per cent do not approve
of smoking in the dormitories; 85
per cent are opposed to it in school 
buildings; 85 per cent are not infavor 
of smoking in |the parks; 71 per cent 
are against it in restaurants; 97 per 
cent disapprove of smoking on the 
streets; 75 per cent approve of smok­
ing in private homes. These results 
I indicate that Carnegie women stu­
dents as a whole are strongly opposed 
to smoking in public but are more 
lenient when it is done in private.
In answer to the question, “Shall 
i we legislate against smoking in places 
j where in the minds of the public it 
j might being discredit on Carnegie”. 
194 per cent of the answers were in 
j the affirmative.

DR. MICHAEL I.PUPIN 
TO SPEAK JUNE 10
The primaries for the Campus 
Queen election will be held Tuesday 
April 16, when every Carnegie stu­
dent will express in ballot form, the 
secret admiration of his heart. From 
the plebe, who at a distance has sur­
veyed the rare beauty of the Senior 
damsels, to the cynical upperclass­
man who has long fallen before their 
triumphant march, all will have 
equal poAver in judging the pulchri­
tude of the Queen of Campus Week.
Now every Maggie has her Jlggs, 
but alas, for that crafty engineer, 
who in his desire to advance tho for­
tunes of his first love, shall deign to 
assume the complex of forgetfulness 
and vote more frequently than in his 
alloted due. This philanthropic per­
son will be confronted with a list of 
all registered students, and tho elec­
tion officials, as behooves exponents
i of true co-educational style will 
show him tho folly of his de-voting 
ways. For it is written that each 
student is entitled to one vote, and 
only one vote. And it is furthor de­
creed that only the Senior lassies 
are eligible. And Alice Nelson’s 
committee will consumate dotails 
and arrangements for the enrollment.
After the first casting of votes, 
with each student's house of cards 
shattered and lost in tho debris of 
another voter's hopes, a bevy of fiftoon 
beautlous maidens will rise trium­
phant. From thoir ranks will bo 
chosen' at a second election, April 30, 
and on May 2, our now Queen. 
The remaining fourteen will serve as 
willing handmaids,^at. the mid-night

Fifth Annual Gambol 
Of Guilds April 17
Schwab Announces Commit­
tee For Dance in Union
“Maggie Murphs and Engineers 
and Arts and Industries” will frolic 
o'er the floor of the Union and the 
Faculty Club from nine ’till one at 
the Fifth Annual Gambol of the 
Guilds. All four scnools are invited 
by the Industries men tQ^ participate 
in the good time. The price has not 
yet been decided but will not be more 
than two dollars.
H. E. Schwab, the General Chair­
man, has surrounded himself with a 
staff of capable assistants: on Gill 
and Beede lies the responsibility of 
the selection of the orchestra; Dun­
can and Van Vechten are planning 
the programs and refreshments; Til- 
brook and Smith will have charge of 
the tickets and publicity; Mims and 
Knappenberger will execute the de­
corations; and J. C. Good will handle 
the other details.
The orchestra will probably be 
either the Collegiate Imps or the 
Techsons, no definite decision hav­
ing been reached a3 yet It will be 
remembered that the Imps furnished 
the music for the Gambol of the 
Guilds last year and well justified 
their popularity on the campus. In 
addition some specialties are being 
planned which will be put across with 
a bang.
The Painting and Illustration stu­
dents in Arts school are executing 
posters which will make their ap­
pearance in the near future. The de­
corations committee is planning spe­
cial lighting effects unlike anything 
yet seen on the campus. The Indus­
tries men are outdoing themselves In 
their efforts to make tho coming 
dance a never-to-be-forgotten event.
THE BOWERY SOLO
There was a little wolm down by the 
coibstone;
And it squoimed and squoimed and 
squoimed—
There was a little bold up in the tree- 
top;
And it cholped and cholped and 
cholped' in a poifect whoil of 
moith ;
And little Hoibert hold him!

Tho Muolcal Clubs gave a delight­
ful program for tho benefit of tho 
largo and appreciative audience 
which attended their twentieth an­
nual Homo Concert at tho Music 
Hall Friday night. Tho numbers 
were sufficiently varied to allow 
each of the clubs to demonstrate its 
skill and to prevent auy spirit of 
ennui from settling on tho llstonor.
The work of tho porfonnora was 
good, but to an luoxopriencod critic, 
tho playing of tho instrumental club 
gavo groatost ovidenco of finish 
whllo tho voices of Eva Sponcor and 
Allan Nern, in their duet, “Doop 
in My Heart, Dear,” gavo greatest 
pleasuro.
Tho Glee Clubs sang their num­
bers with verve and sympathy, the 
girls best effort bolng probably 
Beethoven’s Minuet, whllo tho men 
had their greatest success with the 
“Viking Song” and “Swing Along.”
J. S. Gumbort's singing of tho 
“Song of the iSoul” was very plead­
ing. His voice was perhaps not on 
this occasion capable of such fino 
nuances as at othor times, but, nev­
ertheless, his expression was true 
and charming.
Obio Newman sang several humor­
ous lyrics in his confidential stylo. 
Verne Haldcne, his accompanuist, for 
piano solo, played a reprise of throe 
of his ball show pieces. Tho Col­
legiate Imps Injected some vivid 
dance music into tho program and 
probably induced any undecided cou­
ple present to attend tho dance

VOTING
Beginning this Tuesday, elections will be held in all Jiour schools 
' for class and senate officers. These men are supposed to bo elected 
by a vote oJ! tho entire student body and will be held as true student 
representatives. But they are not. Little more than fifty per cent 
of all the students ever east a ballot at tlie elections. This results, 
sometimes, in dissatisfaction on the part oi! some students over the re­
sults oJ! tho elections, and a division of the support accorded to those 
so elected.
No class officer or representative can do his best work ii! the stu­
dents who elect him arc not behind him, nor will, his statements carry 
the weight they should if it be known that only half the number of 
enrolled students voted in his election.
Tho strength in student government lies in the.fact that it is 
supposed by the students, who aro the biggest factor in the success 
of any college. But when outsiders see that only half the students 
are enough interested in their elections to vote, these people will form 
a poor opinion of that studont body and that school.
It is the duty of every student to vote. What will be done by the 
students next year depends upon tho caliber of ,the men elected this 
spring. They can make or mar the reputation of Garnogio Tech.
Every day wo hear people kicking about tho inefficiency and 
graft of the city government, likewise, every once in a while, some 
students will criticize tho men at tho head of student affairs. And 
usually the students who criticize aro those who didn’t vote at the 
election.
We cannot all be elocted to positions where wo can dictate poli­
cies oi! classos. But we can alI at least do our part in dictating thpso 
policies by voting for thoso students who in our opinions, are most 
capable to render decisions which we feel, from the pant rceords ol’ 
these men, will bo for tho bost interests of Carnogio TocIl
Don't neglect to vote. $ ¡ftfftlsii.
SENIOR HATS
S’ Campus Woolc approaches, word comes to us that the return­
ing Alumni aro considering adopting some distinctive attire to mark 
thoir stay on the campus. Whether this will be in I ho form of bril­
liant lined suspenders, a dilTorent shade for each class, or something 
more elaborate a.long tho lines ol’ an Arts Hall costume, is still far 
from certain. It does seem, however, that with the hats of their 
own selection available, tho Seniors would feci. sulHciout class pride 
to don them, all least during Campus Week.
After all, the success of this big yearly event depends largely 
upon the spirit with which tho students enter into it. The touch of 
color which a Senior hat lends con hardly be overlooked and will 
undoubtedly do much to arouse the enthusiasm of the old grads by 
showing that tho students of today still have tho old desire of being 
marked as Carnegie men.______________________________________________

In the holes, that are now being dug 
on the campus, Many other Improve­
ments aro to bo made. The, plana 
call for two rows of trees running 
from In front of the Arts School 
’down to Machinery Hall between In­
dustries and Sclenco Schools. The 
ground will be covered with loam 
and sowed with clover and grass 
seed.
Three new concrete walks are to 
he laid: one betwen tho Science and 
Industries schools, another from the 
Commons along Woodlawn avenue to 
Tech street, and tho third in front 
of the gymnasium tho full length of 
Tech street* Along various promen­
ades, rustic benches will be placed.
Tho wooden stairs at the side en­
trance to'tho Science School will be 
removed, and a concrete stairway 
constructed in their place. Shrub­
bery and trees will be placed around 
tho new entrance.
These extensive improvements are 
in accordance with the original plan, 
which it has taken years of effort 
and unbellovable sums of money to 
consummate.

1. Isle of Pines Treaty.
2. The New Attorney General.
After long delay and deliberation 
that has robbed the United States of 
any especial credit Jn the act, the 
treaty relinquishing the American 
claim to the Isle of Pines in favor of 
Cuba was ratified this month in the 
Senate. The treaty has been held up 
by one reason or another, since it 
was first negoclated by Roosevelt in 
1903; each president since has urged 
its ratification, and the Foreign Re­
lation Committees in succeeding 
'Senates have openly favored its pas- 
aage.
We became the reclprocant of the 
Isle of Pines, separated from the 
mainland of Cuba by only a shallow 
gulf, when Spain, in 1898, conceded 
to the United States, Porto Rico and 
"other islands of the Caribbean”. 
Since then there has been a mis­
understanding as to whether or not 
the Isle of Pines was included in 
that “other island clause”. Though 
there was some weight to the claim 
of the American title, such right ap­
pears to have been surrendered as a 
rresult of certain negotiations by 
which Cuba gave a number of naval 
bases to the United States.
The advantage of retaining the is­
land, as the Senate saw it, was based 
upon two reasons: first, and most 
important from a national point of 
view, was that the Isle of Pines, ly­
ing close at hand to the Yucatan 
Channel and the Windward Passage, 
was necessary for the defense of the 
Panama Canal, and the second basis 
for holding it, one that was quite 
pertinent, was that through • the de­
lay to come to an agreement on the 
treaty, a great part of the island’s 
property and improvements had 
come into the hands of American 
citizens, who feared the effect of rati­
fication upon their holdings. These 
reasons are not very compelling, 
glancing at our amply equipped 
Canal defense and viewed from 
friendly American relations with 
Cuba during the past twenty years. 
As a result of the treaty’s settlement, 
the -possible seven hundred American 
residents have lost a weak case, but 
there is no reason to believe that 
they should not prosper under Cuban 
rule, and the feeling is that we have 
again lived up to our stand on the 
Monroe Doctrine.
For the second time, Mr. CoolUlge 
lost out in his attempt to force the 
name of Mr. Warren on the Senate 
for their approval as the new Attor­
ney General, and as a result of the 
Impasse, the name of John G. Sar-
Dr. Rayner to Tell About 
Natl. Physical Laboratory
Last Wednesday afternoon at 4:30 j 
p. m., all Margaret Morrison, faculty ' Steel City Collegians to Play 
as well as students, gathered in the |
Recreation Hall for the annual fac- j in K. of C. Ballroom
ulty and student party.
A discussion of some of the stand­
ard methods for the measurement of 
electrical power at commercial fre­
quencies will be included in the pub­
lic lecture to be given Thursday 
night, April 2, by Dr. Edwin H. Ray­
ner, Chief of the Electrical Division 
of the National Physical Laboratory 
in England. The general subject of 
Dr. Rayner’s lecture will be “An Out­
line of the Activities of the National 
Physical Laboratory.”
Dr. Rayner, who has been attend­
ing a meeting of the International 
Committee on Electrical Standards 
recently in this country has been en­
gaged by President Baker to lecture 
for the special benefit of local scien­
tists interested, in the measurement 
of electrical power at commercial fre­
quencies.
The lecture will be given at 8:30 
in the Carnegie Union, and will be 
open to the public.
Dancing and the two stunts were 
the chief features of the afternoon. 
Music for the occasion was furnished 
by an orchestra composed of senior 
girls. A stunt was presented by 
members of the faculty. To the 
Scribblers, as being the newest club 
in school, was given the privilege of 
presenting the other stunt on the 
program.
At the completion of the stunts, tea 
was servpd, after which dancing was 
continued.
Anne Kinzer was chairman of the 
committee in charge, and to her 
should be given the credit for the 
success of the party. Miss Winches­
ter was in charge of the faculty 
stunt, and Harriet Merwin was in 
charge of the Scribblers’ stunt.
gent, a life-long friend and legal ad­
visor of the President from his home 
state was acceptable. The new At­
torney General is a lawyer of 65, for 
mer Attorney General of Vermont, a 
republican of the old school, a good 
executive, and a hard fighter in legal 
cases. His legal attainments, integ­
rity, and personal characteristics are 
impeccable. Mr. Coolldge’s selection 
this time met with the whole hearted 
approval of the Senate, quite in con­
trast to the scene of the day before,' 
when, after four hours of tense de­
bate, Mr. Warren’s nomination was 
rejected.
Mr. Sargent’s nomination signifies 
the President’s surrender to the Sen­
ate. In a public statement of two 
weeks ago, Mr. Coolidge positively 
stated that if the Senate, rejected 
Mr. Warren for the second time, he 
would “offer him a recess appoint­
ment”. One week later, after the 
Senate’s decision, Mr. Sargent was 
appointed. However, it appears that 
in spite of the President’s early inde­
cisiveness, in his fihal choice he has 
selected a man whose character and 
public life are unquestionable.

SCHENLEY THEATER
A student climbing on one of our 
South Lime street cars, handed the 
conductor a transfer.
“This is two days old,” growled 
the latter.
“I’ve been waiting patiently,” the 
student replied.
Trinl and Miss Grace La Rue are 
the headliners this week. The for­
mer is a Spanish dancer, and the lat­
ter is the American songstress. Trini 
comes from Spain with “The Dancing 
Girl”, and will present the Hurtado’s 
Royal Marimba Orchestra for her ac­
companiment.
Miss La Rue will give a recital of 
good songs and will be assisted at 
the piano by Joseph Daly.
Harry and Emma Sharroek present 
“Behind the Grand Stand” which is 
a travesty on the circus fakirs. They 
give a good interpretation of mind 
reading, and it is all in fun—bur­
lesque, if you will.
Larry Meehan and Gertrude New­
man appear in “Broken Promises” 
which blends dancing with songs, and
Beatrice, Irene and Beatrice, a 
ladies harmony trio will be the added 
musical attraction at the Schenley

comedy and News will also be shown.
The great emotional actress, Nazi- 
mova, in “The Redeeming Sin” will 
be the head-line photoplay attraction 
on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. 
Lou Tellegan plays the leading male 
role.
During the week of April 5, the 
Collegiate Imps and Obie Newman 
will furnish the added attraction.
Enjoy Musical Club's Com­
bined Concert Held at P.C.W.
Last Tuesday evening, the Musical 
Clubs of Carnegie and the Pennsyl­
vania College for Women gave a very 
delightful concert in the Chapel of 
the Women’s College. The musical 
program was followed by an infor­
mal dance which was enjoyed by 
everyone.
The girls of the P. C. W. Glee 
Club sang their numbers in a very 
finished manner reflecting great 
credit on the directress. Especially 
interesting was their singing of 
“Swing Along” which is also in the 
repertoire of the Carnegie Club. 
They sang it in a different style, and 
the comparisons of the interpreta­
tions reflected credit on both organ­
izations.
A reading by Elsie McElwain 
pleased the audience very mucli. She 
held them throughout a long and dif­
ficult reading by the cleverness of 
her style, to say nothing of her per­
sonal charm. Two selections by a 
girls’ quartette and a solo by Laur­
etta Light were also well received.
The Carnegie Clubs sang and play­
ed in a very commendable style, but 
lacked the personnel to show their 
best. The Instrumental Club especi­
ally suffered from a lack of full in­
strumentation, the violin section be­
ing the only one to turn out full 
strength. It is a sad state of affairs, 
when the men support the clubs in 
such a half-hearted manner, and it is 
a poor manifestation of Carnegie 
spirit. The manager will remember 
the attitude of these men, when he is 
asked for recommendations for insig­
nia, and will withhold their names. 
It is hoped that there wrll not be a 
recurrence of this trouble.
The Steel City Collegians have 
been engaged to furnish the music 
for the Newman Club Formal which 
is to be held on Friday, May 1. 
These syncopators have established 
an enviable reputation in and around 
Pittsburgh and need no introduction 
to the students of these parts. The

THETA XI WINS CUP DYT—PLEY —B1T:1: 0—UN 
IN SWIMMING MEET; T0UGH EASTERN TRIP
Woodlawn Club, Phi Kappa 
2nd and 3rd—Follansbee 
Proves Star
The first intra-mural swimming 
meet at Carnegie was held last Sat­
urday afternoon and was very suc­
cessful from every point of view. The 
meet was received with much enthu­
siasm from the large crowd that at­
tended, and as a result it will take a 
place alongside the inter-fraternity 
track meet as an annual event.
Theta Xi won possession of the 
swimming cup for the first year by 
amassing a total of 38 points. Their 
nearest rival was the Woodlawn 
Club with 14, followed by Phi Kappa 
which garnered 11 and S. A. E- 
which landed fourth place with a to­
tal of nine points. Delta Tau Delta, 
S. E. P., Kappa Sigma Rho and the 
freshmen finished in the order 
named.
The features of the meet were the 
wonderful performances of Follans­
bee and Hornbostel, both represent­
ing Theta Xi. The former rang up 
three firsts in the 25, 50, and 100 
yard dashes, while his team mate was 
registering a second in the 50 yard 
back stroke, a close first in the fancy 
diving event and swimming anchor 
man on his victorious relay team. 
The most exciting event on the pro­
gram was the 100 yard breast stroke 
which narrowed down to a fight be­
tween McGrail of the Woodlawn 
Club and Ross of Phi Kappa, the lat­
ter winning by a small margin.
The fancy diving. event brought 
forth much applause and the antics 
of a certain Mr. Neff- were very hu­
morous to the crowd. Hornbostel 
and Mollenauer' thrilled the audience 
with some very prety exhibitions of 
diving. Tlie result ended in an aver­
age score of 65.3 to GG.5 favoring the 
diminutive Hornbostel.
The 400 yard relay was another at­
tractive event in which Theta Xi was 
again victorious, with the Woowlawn 
Club second, <S. A. E. third and Delta 
Tau Delta fourth. The winning relay 
team included Harris, Henderson, 
Jont and Hornbostel, their time be­
ing two minutes and 22 seconds.
Coach Beukema was in charge of 
the meet, ably assisted by Fink, 
Moses and Doc Marks. The meet 
was run off in fine style, consuming 
but an hour and a half.

With their first game a little more 
I than a week away, the Carnegie Tech 
I Baseball team is working hard every 
day in order to get a good team to- 
I getlier. At present things are look- 
] ing bright and if the weather is good 
during the next week things will be 
speeded up considerably.
The team will leave next Sunday 
night for Washington, where they 
will play Georgetown on the sixth, 
and Navy on the seventh, and St. 
Johns on the eighth. This schedule 
was changed somewhat from the one 
published before, because it was 
thought the new arrangement would 
give the players 'more time for vaca­
tion.
The team has not been picked as 
yet, but coach Blyth has the men 
working hard each day, and by the 
time for the trip will be able to pick 
the best combination. The men 
showing up well on the slab are Con­
rad, Basset and Lynch, Escher and 
Liberknight are working hard for 
pitchers position also. Hable and 
Diffley are doing best behind the bat, 
and Diffley will probably take the re­
gular position with Hable first sub­
stitute. Downer and Barlow are also 
out for catcher. Newman and Maur­
er are fighting it out for the first 
base position. Maurer will probably 
play first in the games on the trip, 
.because Obie will be kept busy at 
school. Lynch will take the third 
base position while Vogt and McClel­
land will fit into the infield. Chris­
toff, Bastian, and Frost will more 
than likely cover the outfield in the 
first game at least.
’Among the otrers rhar. are showing 
up well are Shriver, Ryan, Fraser, 
and Balir.
The managerlcal force iS in action 
every day, trying to give men the 
best of service. Howard Joynt is 
manager of the telim, with Eugene 
Krebs, Karl Lindaurer and ajck Har­
ris first assistants. The men out 
from the sophomore class include, 
Hotchkiss, Tillbrook, Fr, Kolb, Mc­
Grail, Flowers, and Abbot. The 
freshman class is well represented by 
Bell, Spittka, Hornebostle, Gilchrist, 
Cohen, Ritter and Star, and others.

INTRA-MURAL SPORTS
That not only varsity and freshman teams create intense interest among 
the students at Carnegie is shown by the keen rivalry and large turnouts at 
the various inter-fraternity and inter-class events on the calendar. The 
inter-frnt-dorm basket ball league met with greater success than ever before, 
the swimming meet Saturday was a popular one, and the interest aroused at 
the recent inter-class basket, hall games leads us to feel that such contests 
should have been started earlier in the winter. Agitation is on foot to have 
a soccer league organized, and the students are asking when the inter- 
fraternity track meet is to be held.
All this, we are sure, is a good sign. Not every student can make the 
grade on varsity or freshman teams, yet every normal, healthy young man 
has a supply of pent-up energy which must find outlet in action of some sort. 
There is no better way to get rid of that energy than, through harmless ath­
letics. It is not enough to require every freshman and sophomore to spend 
a couple of hours each week at P. T. He will go through the exercises in a 
listless, aimless way. But substitute some sport iu which the young man can 
strive for a definite goal, and immediately the situation takes on a different 
aspect. The same holds true for the girls.
In many of the leading colleges of the country intra-mural sports are 
established on CT firm footing, and excellent results have been secured. Those 
persons at Carnegie who are in favor of eliminating class and inter-fraternity 
events altogether would do well.to consider the effect of such action on the 
students individually and on the school as a whole.
Everyone is agreed that a sound mind is required to get through courses 
such as are given at this institution. One method of securing a sound mind 
is through development of a. sound body, and what better way to secure a 
sound body than through helpful, invigorating, interesting athletics?
DO YOU KNOW THAT—
Spring football training starts immediately after the students 
return from their Easter vacation, April 14?
Everyone with football ability is expected to report?
Coaches Bob Waddell, Doc Marks, Trainer Bert Munhall and 
Captain Beede will be in charge?
Train will last two weeks?
The baseball team plays three games away during the Easter 
vacation; on April 6 against Georgetown, Navy on April 7 and St. 
Johns on April 8?
The first home baseball game will be against Juniata on April 15?
The first dual track meet is with Allegheny here on May 2?
The Penn Relays are on April 25 and 26, and that Carnegie will 
try to retain the relay championship in the Technical Schools Class, 
after winning it each year for the past three years?.
George Dyke is the only member of last year's relay quartet who 
will run on the team this year, the others having graduated or drop­
ped out of school?*******
THE FINALS
By the time this issue is out, the school basket ball champions 
will be known. At this writing the Scobell. and Phi Kappa teams 
must play off a tie. Po Kappa Alpha, last year's champions, are elim­
inated.
It has been a great season, marred only by a couple of accidents 
which were unfortunate indeed. Both of the victims, however, have 
taken their misfortunes in a philosophical manner.
All of which promises bigger things for next year.**** + ¦»*
TRACK MATERIAL MEDIOCRE 
The track meet held at the Armory Friday and Saturday demonHtrated 
one fact conclusively—the material at Carnogie is only fair. Coach Guy 
Halferty has his work cut out for him in developing a representative track 
team this spring. But while the men are young and green, they are willing 
to give their best, and we are confident there is no better track coacli 
in the Pittsburgh district than Halferty. Such a. combination is suro to 
bring results before the season is over.******
Nurmi did not break any records while in Pittsburgh, but tlmt. Is no 
reflection against the Abo star. It must bo remembered that tho track is 
new, and only a tenth of a niile in length. It is no oaay feat to make good 
time when running around curves so much. Besides wo have a hunch Nurmi 
is getting tired of running day after day.
But while the track at the armory is new, it is in bettor shape than we 
thought it would be. Much of the credit for this is duo our own Bert Mun­
hall, who supervised its construction.• * * * * * *
Corbett, Pitt runner, and Dykeman, former Carnogio star, proved to bo 
the outstanding performers of the two nights. Wrich proves that local talent 
is just as good as any in the country.*******
If you were not present at the swimming meet in tlie pool at tho now 
Gym Saturday, you surely missed a treat. Just as exciting as a spirited 
track meet. Tho Tartans liavo some real stars in tho making, and next 
fall we expect to step right out with a varsity team.******
Why prevent a man who has made a letter In one sport, from playing in 
other Intra-mural sports? If ho has, for instance, made a letter in football, 
there is no reason why ho should not be allowed to play intor-fnit, basket 
ball. He needs exercise during the winter, and may for that matter bo only 
a mediocre basket ball player, fitting nicely into tho spirit of the enter­
prise. ________________________________________________________

! All the past weolc has been cle- 
j voted to playing off tho finals of the 
1 Interfruternity-Donnitory League, but 
I the ultimate winner was yet to be 
determined at tho time of this writ­
ing.
Ono team, Pi Kappa. Alpha, is 
definitely eliminated;' but Scobell 
ilall and Phi Kappa Svere scheduled 
to meet Monday, March 30, in the 
deciding contest. This prolongation 
of the series as originally made up 
was necessitated by a tie result last. 
Thursday between tho latter two 
teams, a mixup in the score prevent­
ing Immediate playoff.
Opening tho championship games 
Saturday, tlie 21st., Phi Kappa de­
feated Pi Kappa. Alpha by 0110 goal 
in a well played contost. Tho fol­
lowing Monday, Scobell in turn beat 
Phi Kappa by displaying a better 
brand of foul shooting, only to suc­
cumb to Pi Kappa Alpha the next 
night, and: thoreby even up the 
standing. Meeting the Pi Kap’s for 
tho socond' titmo, Phi Kappa repeat­
ed by winning 15 to S, although the 
former led at half time. McGuiro 
was tho bost performor In either 
team. Then came the closest on- 
eountor of the week, with Scobell 
engaging the Phi Kap’s again. Dun­
can, though playing only part time, 
made three goals for tho dorm team, 
blit Siehi of tho opposition scored 
fivo baskets, so that noithor had any 
great advantage, and tho final scoro 
stood 14 to 14. his game was to be 
replayed tho following Monday, and 
tho winner should be tho victor in 
tho entire- elimination sorios, as tho 
PI K. A. team lost all chance when 
Scobell won from thom last Friday.
Having already chosen a represen­
tative team In each of tho throe
leagues, an all-star aggregation 
might be pickod from thom as fol­
lows :
First Team—........................................
Conley (Hend.) .................................Fd.
Sichi (Phi K.)...................................Fd..
Goodwin (D. U.).................................C.
Duncan (Scobell) ...........................Gd.

Next in lino, In addition to thoso 
montionod in last week's league

Trophy Room in New Gym 
To Be Varsity Clan Room
The Athletic Council recently au­
thorized Graduate Manager of Ath­
letics Clarence Overend to make ar­
rangements for furnishing and decor­
ating the trophy room to the left of 
the men’s entrance to the new gym­
nasium. The contract has been let 
and plans have been drawn up for 
the work. It is expected that the 
room will be ready for occupancy 
within the next couple of weeks.
The entrance to the trophy room 
will be through double-doors opening 
into the hallway. To the left of the 
entrance will be stationed a writing 
desk along the wall. Next to that 
will be a builtin wall seat. At the 
end of the room is a large fire-place, 
while on the other side of the fire­
place will be more built-in seats.
In the center of the room a table 
will 4-un lengthwise with the room, 
and at each end of the table will be 
a comfortable lounging davenport. 
At the far end of the room a trophy 
show case will be stationed to hold 
cups, trophies, and the like. A long 
frame will be placed along one wall 
which will hold pictures of various 
varsity and freshman teams, divided 
according to years. Chairs will he 
stationed at various other places In 
the room.
Light will he furnished by three 
large windows and throo chandeliers 
on the celling. The trophy room Is 
'expected to present a very cheerful 
and restful appearance when It Is 
completed, and will be a haven for 
visitors and old grads, as well as 
thoso now In, school.

The last buskotoall game of the 
series for tlio inter-class champion­
ship will be played this afternoon be­
tween tho Juniors and tho Sopho­
mores.
From prosent indications it looks 
as though another game between tho 
Sophomores and Design will be 
necessary to detormlno the winner. 
Both of these teams have done very 
woll since tho beginning of the sea­
son, and if it comes to a toss-up be­
tween them, it will bo hard to pro* 
diet the results.
The Sophomores have last yoar’s 
reputation in their favor for as fresh­
men they -wore the winners of the 
cup. However, the ' Design teftm 
boast some of tho best material in 
the school. Tho team is composed 
almost wholly of freshmen.
The otlior class teams deserve 
commendation for the good struggle 
they have put up. Certainly all tho 
girls 011 the teams are to bo con­
gratulated 011 the fine spirit which 
tlioy have shown in coming out, when 
it would bo so much easier to do as 
the majority do—simply not bother, 
inasmuch as they receive little or 110 
reward in tho form of receiving let­
ters, making varsity teams, etc.
It must be admitted that in a 
school where all activities must be 
carried on after 4:30 p. ni„ that a 
large numbor cannot bo expected to 
como out for anything requiring so 
much physical effort as athletics. 
What is to bo done about, existing 
conditions remains a puzzle. But in 
tho face of such conditions too much 
praiso cannot bo given to tho girls 
who have dono thoir bost to keep 
athletics on the map at' Carnegie.

POINTS AT ARMORY
Dykeman-Corbett Duet Wins 
From Olympic Runners 
in Two Mile Relay
The Skibo track team did not. faro 
as well as it as hoped they would in 
tho Hunt Armory meet last Friday 
and Saturday nights. Only two 
points were scored for Carnogie as 
against 27 for Pitt and 17 for West 
Virginia on Friday night, while on 
tho folloAvlng evening tho only Car­
nogio man to scoro was Dykeman, 
who with Ted Corbolt of Pitt won 
the two mile relay event in record 
time. Paavo Nurmi and Willie Ri- 
tola, noted Olympic champions and 
featured stars of the meet, wero not 
hard pressed in their events nnd con­
sequently failed to set any new 
records.
The scoring for Carnegie on Friday 
evening was done by the relay team 
consisting of Biers, Kelley, Dyke, 
and Seaman, which captured a third 
place in the college relay.. Pitt and 
Geneva finished first and second, re­
spectively, in this event. The Pitt 
team set a fast pace and gradually 
drew away from tho rest of the field, 
crossing tho nish in remarkably 
good time. The Tartan representa­
tives, however, presented a well 
coached quartet1, which with a bit 
more speed ought to do vory well in 
tho Penn Relays of a few weeks 
lionco. Tho other marker hung up 
for Carnogio on tho same evening 
was mado by Tod* Stult/z in the 50- 
yard low hurdles. Stultz won his 
heat in seven seconds, but did not 
place In tho finals held 011 the fol­
lowing evening. Do Vries, of Car­
nogie. placed second in another of 
tho 60-ynr<l low hurdle heats.
Tho feature event of tho Saturday 
night's porformanco was tho victory 
of I1I10 Dykeman-Corbett duo in tho 
two-mile team race. Tills stellar 
combination outran Bay Dodge and 
Ray Watson of tho Illinois Athlotic 
Club, and Gunmlr Nlllson and Ilmer 
Prim of til© FinnIsh-Amorlean Ath­
letic Club, t.'o capture first place in 
as an exciting scamper as local fans 
have ovor witnessed. Tills victory
of Pittsburgh’s own stars outshone 
the wide margined triumphs of Nur­
mi and Elf.ola, and tho 440-yard
handicap which Alim Helffrlcli walk­
ed away with,
Tho Dykeman and Corbett, teams 
took a commanding load at tho
start >md at ono (.Into woro some 
forty yards ahead of tho Illinois and

crowd now on it» foot and shouting 
madly, Corbolt spurted ahoatl of the 
Illinois roprosontiitlvo on tho hack,

feet to tho good.
Such a disappointing allowing ntt 
the Carnogie squad may have made, 
onn he explained In part by the fact' 
that In tho hand leap nicos, the Plaid

Successful Affair 
Held at Monessen
Alumni in Upper Mononga- 
hela Valley to Organize
A very enjoyable gathering was 
hold by Alumni and former students 
who are located in the Upper Mo- 
nongahela Valley.
The afl’air wus hold at JohnBon’B on 
Sixth street, on Wednesday, March 
18. About twenty-flvo Carnegie men 
and women were present. Tho oarly 
part of tho evening was occupied by 
dancing and singing of Carnegie 
songs. This was followed by vari­
ous stunts. Later the group gather­
ed at tlie tables for a luncheon 
which by all indications was thor­
oughly enjoyed.
Tho evening waB devoted entirely 
to social evonts which seemed to bo 
very agreeable to the majority pres­
ent.
Additional get-togethers of the 
Carnegie men and women of this 
district are being planned as thero 
has grown to bo qulto a largo body 
of grads in tills section. It is hoped 
that these affairs and gatherings will 
build up a live wire organization 
to represent their Alma Mater.

Miss Alice Nixon of 58 Schoonmaeh- 
or avenue, Monosscn, Pa., will ap­
preciate getting your name and ad­
dress if you are in this section and

GIRLS’ DORMS TO HOUSE 
ALUMNAE DURING 6 C.W.
The Alumni Campus Week Com­
mittee and Dean Brown are endea­
voring to maleo arrangements so that 
women graduates returning to Cam­
pus Week will be able to stay at the 
girls’ dormitories.
It is extremely inconvenient, for 
women especially, to attempt to at­
tend all the Campus Week events 
without staying on the campus. To 
be Bure, it might be possible to ob­
tain accommodations at a near-by 
boarding house, but ut best, it is un­
desirable, and boarding houses in the 
vicinity of the campus will probably 
be overflowing during the celebra­
tions. The alternative would be to 
stay at a hotel, but this arrangement 
does not overcome the difficulty, 
since even tho Sclienley, the nearest 
hotel to, the campus, is at such a 
distance as to make it troublesome 
to travel back and forth.
Realizing these conditions, the com­
mittee has found an admirable solu­
tion to tho problem by providing for 
tho women grads to stay at the girls’ 
dormitories. With the assistance of 
Doan Brown, this project will pro­
bably be successful, and tho alum­
nae need not liavo any fear of expe­
riencing difficulty in finding a place 
to» stay.
Provisions Made For 
Alumni, Campus Week
EveryiEffort Being Made to 
Aid Former Students
Alumni i^oturning to Cnrnogio for 
this year's Campus Wqolc will, find a 
dlfforont atmosphoro from that of 
previous years. Every attempt will 
bo made to glvo them a royal wel­
come, to make sure that they will 
enjoy every moment of tho time, and 
to niako thorn realize that Campus 
Week Is primarily a million of Car- 
noglo graduates.
In tho first placo special arrange 
monts are being made in regard to 
registration. Formerly, all alumni 
registered at the same placo and on 
the same list, a procedure which pro- 
sontod rather soiious difficulties 
when ono desired to look up an old 
classmato. This yoar, each class will 
register by Itself, FL that graduatos 
can roadlly dotormino just which 
members of their or of any otlior 
class are attending Campus Woolc.
Anothor innovation, which will en­
able old friends to got together, Is 
the reservations being made at Car­
negie Inn and the Commons. The 
cinssos of ’OS, ’09, '10, and '11, will 
have tables set aside for them at 
these places at certain hours during 
the day, so that they may lunch to­
gether without being disturbed. With 
this provision, they will not be forced 
to wait for others to finish eating, 
and will be assured of a place where 
they can congregate and discuss old 
times.
For fear that some of the grads of 
Carnegie’s first classes may not be 
able to find their way about the 
campus, student guides are to be ap­
pointed. These guides will be in­
structed to give all possible assis­
tance to returning alumni, and to 
show them all the wonders of Car­
negie’s Campus, such as the new 
gymnasium, the Carnegie Inn, and 
other points of interest which they 
might not be acquainted with.
So, it is quite apparent that every 
effort is being expended to insure 
real "Old Home Week” for the alum­
ni, and to make them feel that they 
are still a part of Carnegie.

CHEMICALS PLAN ANNUAL 
THEATRE PARTY FOR MAY 2
On Saturday, May 2, 1925, the Car­
negie Chemical Engineers will hold 
their annual party in the Drama De­
partment Theater. Tickets may be 
obtained by sending a stamped self- 
addressed envelope with a request 
for the number of desired tickets to 
Rudyard Porter, 210 Semple street, 
Oakland, Pittsburgh, Pa. Owing to 
the fact that only a limited number 
are available this year all Carnegie 
Chemical Engineers are advised to 
order their tickets immediately. This 
notice takes the placo of the usual 
post card announcements.

Frank: "Fine, thanks. How’s all

Angry Prof: "How dare you swear

Stude: "How was I to know you
wanted to Bwear first?”
"Has the College of Engineering 
got the best curriculum for giving 
the Engineering student the best 
education possible for the Engineer­
ing world.” This was the main topic 
of discussion at the Alumnl-Faculty 
dinner in the Seventh Avenue Hotel 
on Saturday evening.
The banquet hall was well filled by 
six o’clock and at 6:15 dinner w’as 
served to over a hundred Engineering 
alumni and faculty members. By 
7:30 all those present had stored up 
enough energy to begin the lively dis­
cussions which were knbwn to be 
coming.
Professor Tiinks opened the meet­
ing by a few introductory remarks 
and introduced one of the most prom­
inent Alumnus, Mr. John F. Laboon, 
president of the Engineering Alumni 
Association, who acted as chairman 
during the evening.
The; chairman, in picking men to 
lead the discussion, tried to select 
men who wero following engineering 
lines and not those who had branched 
off in other lines.
Among the questions which pro­
bably received the most discussion 
and the largest concensus of opinion 
gathered was a change in the course 
of mathematics in which the engi­
neering student would be given two 
years of math and then have tlie third 
year optional. Some expressed the 
opinion that none but the upper 
third be allowed to continue on with 
the additional year’s work.
An almost unanimous opinion was 
given in approval of the idea of re- 
introduction of the personal inter­
view at the time of admission for 
the purpose of admitting excellent 
men who under the present system 
cannot enter.
One other topic which received 
much discussion 'was "having more 
intimate contact between department 
heads and the freshman”.
The discussion was pro and con

mittee felt that the evening was a

By Dr. J. H. James.
In the most cursory survey of the 
history of engineering, we can but 
note that this profession has had to 
become subdivided with the growth 
of our industrial life. The first en­
gineer was the military officer en­
gaged in the construction of all the 
walls, earthworks, etc., that went 
with warfare, he civil engineer was 
so named to distinguish him work 
from that’ of the military engineer— 
work largely similar, but having to 
do with the development of con­
struction projects related to civil.- 
So it has gone on, as science devel­
oped and its application to industrial 
life increased, we have seen succes­
sively the separation of new branch­
es of engineering, in this way mining 
engineering became established, then 
mechanical, electrical metallurgical 
and finally the comer—chemical en­
gineering.
While we can say that some of 
our chemical industries reach back 
into tlie remote past, these are 
based on processes that could be 
worked out in a crude sort of way 
entirely by "rule of thumb” methods. 
In this period there were developed 
only the more easily discovered re­
actions, most of which resulted from 
keen observation of natural phenom­
ena, and a great deal wa& uncovered 
by accident. Such as scheme does 
not rest upon any sure foundation, 
and progress is bound to be slow.
With the real scientific develop­
ment of chemistry in the last one 
hundred and fifty years, we have 
had a growth of those industries 
based on chemistry many fold great­
er than in all the previous history of 
the race.
Right here we might bring out the 
two divisions of chemical activity 
which have been logically created 
from the requirements of industry. 
First, is the ield of chemical re­
search. Before we can have the ap­
plications of scientilc principles, the 
science itself must be developed. Re­
search work is the necessary prere­
quisite to any line of chemical manu- 
factureing. The engineer’s work in 
this field, as in all others, is to take 
the work of the research worker 
and carry out the large scale opera­
tions necessary to launch the partic­
ular process on a commercial scale.
The course given the chemical en­
gineer then, should be a mixture of 
chemistry, physics and mathematics, 
together with a certain amount of 
engineering. The chemical engineer 
is a chemist as far as his knowledge 
of chemic reactions goes and an en­
gineer in connection with the instal- 
lation and operation of appliances, 
machines, apparatus, etc., required 
in large scale operations.
The course given the young man 
preparing for the research field, is 
markedly different from the forego­
ing. He needs a reading knowledga 
of French and German, he must 
spend more time on the more ab­
stract portions of chemistry and 
physics, and he should have that in­
born curiosity which motivates the 
successfud research men.
It is evident that the chemical en­
gineer form the very nature of his 
work, should possess those qualities 
which will make the good executive. 
As to the relative importance of the 
work covered in the two fields out­
lined above, they are equally impor­
tant—one cannot develop without the 
other.
The activities embraced in chem­
ical manufacturing extend beyond 
the mere making of what are com­
monly called "chemicals/’ All other 
manufacturing processes based oa 
chemical reactions are included as 
well; rubber, paints and varnishes, 
blass and ceramics, petroleum pro­
ducts, cement, food stuffs, artificial 
silk, artificial leather, artificial ivory 
and other plastics, paper manufac­
ture only a few of the industries 
represented.
‘ In the so-called "chemical” group, 
we have an equally long list elec­
trochemical products, coal tar hydro­
carbons, coal tar intermediates, coal 
tar colorsr photochemicals, synthetic 
drugs, explosives both military and 
industrial, heavy chemicals such as 
acids, bases, and salts, nitrogen com­
pounds from the air, fertilizers, etc.
During and since the great war, 
the attention of all the people iu 
the United States has been brought 
to the problems connected with hav­
ing self-contained chemical industries 
and our national i defense. It is now 
agreed that not only the develop­
ment of these industries make the 
country great financially, but that 
the group as a whole is absolutely 
needed in this country from the 
standpoint of preparedness.
big success. The expressions of 
opinion is what is needed to assist 
the curriculum committee who meet 
annually to make changes in the 
course of study.
The meeting was a lively affair 
and just as was intended. Very in­
formal allowing any one who wished 
to express his opinion.
Among the graduates who gave 
discussions were: W. W. Slocum,
’08, who gave a resume of the previ­
ous meeting held on December 13, 
bringing those who wero absent- be­
fore up-to-date on developments thus 
far. J. H. Waxman, '11, who believ­
es that In addition to the engineer­
ing work being given, economics and 
industrial history should be stressed 
more.
Among the others were. E. S. 
Reno, '15, Skinkle, '17.
Among tho faculty who were pre­
sent was Professor Trlnks, Blaisdell, 
and Hower. Also Dr. Rittman, Dr. 
James, Dr. Alexander, Professor 
Riggs, Nathanson, and Boreinan.
The meeting was considered very 
successful from every viewpoint, and 
although no definite arrangements 
have been made, it is known that 
more of theso meetings will be held. 
Fine spirit and co-operation exists 
between the alumni and faculty and 
much is expected from these joint 
meetings.
THE LOVER CONSULTS HIS 
THESAURUS.
Oh, lady, woman, female, filly,
Dame, maiden, flapper, Jane,
You’ve made me nutty, crazy, silly, 
Unbalanced, mad, insane.
I worship, adulate and love you, 
Admii-e, adore, acclaim,
I swear by heaven up above you 
For you I burn, glow, flame.
Flare, fulmigate, consume and smoul­
der,
Seethe, broil and incandensce;
For, to the eye of this beholder,
Your style, charm, lovliness.
Bloom, beauty, pulchritude and fair­
ness,
Unmatched, unrivaled are,
And of such pricelessness and rare­
ness,
That never comet, star.
Sun, • satellite, orb, world or planet, 
Holds comparable grace 
To yours; and every time I scan it 
I know that all through space
You are unique, lonely, solitary, 
Supreme, without a peer.
I say tills in a fashion very 
Frank, honest, true, sincere.
And should you pick some other fel­
low,
Guy, Gink, gazabo, bird,
I’d turn blue; green and sickly yellow 
I would, upon my word.
I’d loathe, abhor, abominate him, 
Disrelish and detest,
Envenom, execrate, and hate him 
With Vigor, vim and zest.
My love will not change, shift or 
falter,
But stay, remain, abide.
Come, let us march up to the altar 
Be wed. spliced, married, tied!
