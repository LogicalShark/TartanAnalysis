Abiding Program •
Hunts To Give 
Tech New Library
By Nancy Tull
On Tuesday, October 28, President Warner and Mr. 
James Bovard, chairman of the Board of Trustees, announced 
at a press conference that Mr. and Mrs. Roy A. Hunt have 
given Tech a gift of $2,800,000 for the construction of a new
campus library. ?--------------—--------------------------------
Also revealed at this time was Qmega
Placed On Social 
Probation By CFP
the fact that construction of the 
proposed Activities Center is to 
begin early next spring. Dr. War­
ner stated that it is hoped that 
t* plans for the Activities Cen­
ter will be ready for bids in Jan­
uary.
The new Hunt Library of steel 
framing with aluminum facing 
will be located in the space now 
occupied by Skibo, the present 
focal point for student campus 
life. One outstanding feature of 
the Hunt Library wrill be a 10,000 
¿4Jiare foot penthouse which will 
house the valuable rare botanni- 
cal book collection of Mrs. Hunt. 
The penthouse will be surrounded 
by a promenade and rows of trees 
and shrubs.
Needed Space 
This gift of the Hunts’ will pro­
vide much needed space for our 
presently overcrowded libraries, 
¿¡^weli as a means for integrating 
the seven existing libraries. The 
Hunt Library is designed to ac­
commodate 350,000 books in the 
library proper, plus another 125,- 
000 in basement alcoves.
A sub-basement will provide 
additional storage and file space. 
(Since the library collection is 
now approximately 147,000 and 
annual gain each year is 8,000 
volumes, the library will ade­
quately provide for expansion in 
volumes, the library will ade- 
the next 25 years.
Facilities 
There will be space for readers, 
collections, and other library fa­
cilities, as well as special student 
group-study rooms and small 
JSninar rooms.
Mr. Hunt, chairman of the ex­
ecutive committee of the Alumi­
num Company of America, is a 
senior board member of CIT and 
the vice chairman of the board’s 
executive committee.

Justice found Alpha Tau Omega 
guilty of violating social proba­
tion and imposed a penalty of nine 
weeks social probation extending 
from November 3, 1958 to Jan­

time ATO was on social probation 
imposed last spring by CFP Court 
as a result of a Spring Carnival 
celebration.
Originally ATO was charged by 
four fraternities, Beta Sigma Rho,

Assembly Topic
“Chinese Communists: 1948-58,” 
a symposium by Dr. Paul Ward 
and Mr. David Gidman of the 
Tech History department, will 
highlight the assembly program 
scheduled for next Tuesday, No­
vember 11 at 11:30 in the Fine

Speaking from personal experi­

what they saw and learned about 
the Chinese Communists between 
1948 and 1958 and what they feel 
is the direction of Chinese Com­
munism today.
They will also consider the 
growth and development of China 
in relation to the capacity of the 
present regime to reconcile the 
new surge towards industrialism 
with the ancient traditions and 
common opinions they observed 
in China proper.

Competition Firsts
Sigma Nu 
Wins Cheer
By Tom Bieg
A crowd of about five hundred 
attended the Homecoming pep 
rally last Friday evening in the 
Bowl. The main attraction was the 
pledge cheer competition, which 
was won by Sigma Nu.
The Sigma Nu pledges, present­
ed a spirited, original, and co­
ordinated cheer to win the com­
petition for the fourth time in 
five years.
Torch Parade
A block-long parade of torch- 
bearing pledges and other stu­
dents followed the Kiltie vest- 
pocket ensemble and the cheer­
leaders into the bowl where there 
was a house-top high bonfire.
The program was emceed by 
Jeff Jordan of KDKA television. 
The cheerleaders led the crowd in 
a few Tartan cheers and Mr. Jor­
dan presented a humorous mono­
logue before introducing the 
pledge cheers.
The Homecoming Dance held last Saturday evening from 
9:00 to 1:00 in the gym climaxed Tech’s 1959 Homecoming

Homecoming Queen And Court 
Presented During Half Time
Tech’s 1958 Homecoming Queen, Suzie Bradford, and the 
two members of the Court, Lana Kubasek, and Jan Conrad, 
were presented to alumni and students in a gala half-time 
ceremony at Saturday’s game>
The trio of beauties rode on 
floats in the shape of huge swans, 
each pulled by four fraternity 
pledges. The floats were wheeled 
into the field and brought to a 
stop before the crowd, the girls 
hidden by the swans' wings.
Announcer Don Beaman wel­
comed alumni to the Homecoming 
Pageant and introduced the three 
finalists with a romantic tale:
“Once upon a time in the King­
dom of Carnegie Tech there lived 
three princesses, one of them to 
be chosen queen. But when their 
loyal subjects could not decide on 
one, Harpo the Happy Hexer 
changed the maidens into three 
lovely swans, stating that he 
would choose the ruler on No­
vember 1, 1958.
Of the first swan he asked,
‘What do you offer your subjects?’ 
and she replied, ‘My charm and 
winning smile I’ll give; my life as! related with fear and anxiety.

Moyer Speaks 
At Assembly
Dr. Kenneth Moyer, associate 
professor of psychology at Tech, 
discussed “Adrenalin and Fear,” 
yesterday at the all-school as­
sembly held from 11:30 to 12:20 
in the Fine Arts Theatre.
Outlining his procedure for ex­
perimentation, he explained how 
the adrenal gland was removed 
from some rats and their behavior 
pattern was compared to those 
with normal adrenal glands.
He found that those rats having 
no adrenal glands appeared to evi­

It is generally agreed, by alumni 
and under-graduates alike, that 
the fraternity Homecoming dis»- 
plays wei'e better this year than 
they have been.
Each display was outstanding in 
its own way, but three were 
chosen by the judges as being 
more outstanding than the rest: 
The .first place trophy was award­
ed to Kappa Sigma for their dis­
play centered around the story of 
the Pied Piper. The display con­
sisted of a large book. On one 
page was the story, “The Pied 
Piper of Tartan,” which read: 
Kappa Sigma 
Tartan towns in Oakland by 
famous Pittsburgh city,
The river Monongahela wide 
washed its wall on the
southern side,
A pleasanter spot you have 
never spied, and here the 
Piper did abide.
One day the Geneva rats in­
vaded,
They thought the Piper wa$> 
overrated.
But, alas, he drove them to
their doom and drowned *
them in a watery tomb.
Lettering 
The lettering of this story was 
done in Old English style. On the 
opposite side was a picture made 
of figures. The scene was of a
street with a cartle at the far 
end, a small village in the mid­
dle and the rats goirtg into the 
water in the foreground.
Done in perspective, it showed
synchronized with the lighting of 
the figures, consisted of the

enthusiasts in Thistle Hall.
At 11:00 the awards for Home­
coming competitions were pre­
sented. Co-chairmen of Homecom­
ing, Sally Lindsay and Fred Heid- 
er, thanked the student body for 
their co-operation and then pre­
sented Susie Bradford, who 
awarded the trophies, the first of 
which went to Sigma Nu who won 
the pledge class cheer competition 
for the second year in a row.
Varsity Varieties
Another second consecutive 
winner was Delta Gamma, whose 
skit “The Evil Eye” took first 
place in Varsity Varieties. The 
trophies for second and third 
places were awarded respectively 
to the Chi Omega’s for their pre­
sentation of “Sleeping , Beauty” 
and the Kappy Kappy Gamma’s 
for their skit, “The Black Spot.” 
Kappy Sigma took the first 
place for its display, “The Pied 
Piper of Tartan.” The second 
place trophy was awarded to Al­
pha Tau Omega for its display, 
“Jack the Giant-Killer, while 
third place went to Beta Theta 
Pi for its display, “The Flying 
Dutchman.”
Decorations 
The decorations put up by Stu­
dent Congress members were re­
presentations of some of the curse 
themes used by the fraternities 
and sororities for their displays 
and skits.
The swan floats, in which »the 
queen and her court were pre­
sented in the half-time pageant 
at th? football game, decorated

Morewood Gardens Dormitory 
Council, has financially “adopted” 
Cho Chung Hi, a 13-year-old 
Korean girl, through Foster Par­
ents’ Plan, Inc., of New York 
City.
“As “Foster Parents,” More­
wood Gardens will contribute $15 
a month towrard the child’s sup­
port for at least one year.
Foster Plan
Foster Parents’ Plan, wKich has 
rehabilitated more than 760,000 
children on a personal basis since 
its founding in 1937, is now help­
ing 11,500 youngsters in Greece, 
Italy, South Korea, France, Bel­
gium, Viet Nam and in the DP 
camps of West Germany. Over the 
past twenty years, more than 
600,000 individuals and groups in 
America have helped needy chil­
dren overseas through Foster 
Parents’ Plan.
“We are indeed grateful to this 
group for giving Chung Hi this 
wonderful gift of hope and help,” 
declared Miss Gloria C. Matthews, 
Executive Director of Foster Par­
ents’ Plan, “and we prayerfully 
hope that many others who read 
this will also extend a helping 
hand to a distressed child.” 
Organization
Foster Parents’ Plan is a non­
profit, non-propaganda, non-sec­
tarian, independent, government- 
approved relief organization 
which provides children who are 
orphaned, distressed, or otherwise 
made destitute with the care, ed­
ucation, and moral support they 
need. “Adoption” through Plan is 
financial, not legal.
The Foster Parent promises to 
contribute $15 monthly for at 
least one year. Of this sum, the 
child receives $8 each month as 
an outright cash grant. The re­
mainder is used for periodic food 
and new clothing packages, trans­
lations of letters, medical services 
and education.
Because each child is treated as 
an individual, any special needs 
of the child or his family are tak­
en care of by Plan from its Gen­
eral Fund. This fund is made up 
of contributions from the public.
Chung Hi wras boi'n in Seoul 
| where her father was a broker 
and supported his family com- 
j fortably. They lived in a big 
house which they owrned. All this 
1 was lost forever with the out­
break of war when their home 
was completely destroyed in a 
| bombing raid and they barely es­
caped the besieged city with their 
lives.
They reached a place of refuge 
in Taejon but all places of safety 
were overcrowded with homeless, 
hungry refugees and life for all 
became a desperate, sometimes 
; hopeless, struggle for day-to-day 
; existence. Food supplies, dimin- 
| ished, shelter and employment 
became almost impossible to find 
and disease ran rampant among 
the weary, half-starved people.

Series Of Talks 
On Responsibility
By Lois Wolf
“Working Against Odds” is the 
topic of discussion for the Insti­
tute of International Relations, at 
Chatham College, November 6, 7, 
and 8; this institute will particu­
larly deal with the problems of 
“What Is Your Responsibility.”
Four speakers will discuss the 
topic. Friday, Albert Bigelow, a 
former Lt. Commander in the 
U. S. Navy, will stress that if one 
feels the government should stop 
nuclear tests, the odds are 
against him.
Mr. Bigelow speaks from ex­
perience as he tried to petition 
against such tests and his peti- 
tiow as given no consideration. 
He was imprisoned because he 
took more drastic measures to 
end nuclear testing; he tried to 
sail a small vessel into the test­
ing area.
Theodore Benfey
Saturday morning, Theodore 
Benfey, from the Department of 
Chemistry at Earlham College 
and former president ofthe “So­
ciety for Social Responsibility in 
Science,” will discuss whether or 
not a scientist has a responsibility 
to society for his nuclear inven­
tions.

General in the U. S. Army, will

tend regular school, the two old­
est children attended night school 
and took whatever work they 
could find during the day. The 
mother was a peddler in the 
market place earning a pitiful few 
cents a day. As competition grew 
in the market place the mother 
was no longer able to earn any­
thing and so since 1956, she has 
been a water-carrier.
Every morning before people 
begin to cook the mother has to 
deliver water to every housewife 
who wants it. She puts a pole 
across her shoulders and hangs 
two buckets of water on each 
side, balancing them like a scale. 
This job too has .een competition 
and she has only seven families 
as customers, receiving $1.30 a 
month from each.
Eldest Sons 
Her two eldest sons used to 
help her but now Eui Soo (18) is 
working for an automobile repair 
shop as an unskilled factory hand 
earning $10.00 a month and Yee 
Soo (17) is working as a laborer 
and earns about $12.00 monthly.
Chung Hi’s sister, Soo Bak (19) 
is working as a waitress earning 
$14.00 a month; she is attending 
the third grade grade of night- 
high-school. Another sister, Hoon 
Hi (14) is at home doing house­
work and Chi Soo (9) the young­
est boy is attending the 3rd grade 
of primary school.
Total Earnings 
The combined earnings of the 
mother and three children gives 
the family less than 20c a day .per 
person to provide food and all 
other needs.
Chung Hi is an intelligent, sen­
sible girl, pleasant speaking and 
sociable. Because of her family’s
lecture Saturday evening.. Since 
Mr. Hester visited Russia in 1957 
and interviewed Nikita Krushev, 
he has become certain that the 
way to maintain international re­
lations is not through war and its 
constant threat.
Non-Violent Resistence
On Sunday, Bayard Rustin, Ex­
ecutive Secretary of War Resis­
ters League, lecturer and singer, 
will address the audience on the 
non-violent resistence of the en­
emy—no weapons even if the en­
emy uses them. He is a follower 
of the Gandhi technique.
The discussions, to which all 
college students will be admitted 
free of charge, are being spon­
sored by the Quakers.
“This Institute of International 
Relations is designed for people 
who want more information about 
controversial topics of the day. 
The Quakers are known for their 
stand against the use of war and 
violence. Students who would 
like to her a presentation of the 
point of view should be particu­
larly stimulated by attending 
some of the Institute sessions,” 
stated Dr. Robert M. Morgan, 
head of the Bureau of Measure­
ment and Guidance on campus.

school, until she received PLAN 
aid and so she is now in the 
fourth grade of primary school. 
However, she has been an honor 
student in her class ever since she 
started school and ranks first 
among her 78 classmates.
Arithmetic is her favorite sub­
jects in which she always gets 
100. She is also talented in sing­
ing and often sings solo at the 
school’s special programs. She is 
a pretty girl, sweet and thought­

Varsity Varieties 
Skits Show Much 
Professional Talent
By Arlene Logioco
Delta Gamma won the first 
place trophy for the second year 
in a row for the best skit in Var­
sity Varieties. Second and third 
place awards went to Chi Omega 
and Kappa Kappa Gamma, re­
spectively.
“The Evil Eye” was the theme 
of the D.G.’s original skit which 
featured L’il Abner characters. 
Costumes were colorful, stage 
movement was good, and the 
singing done in harmony. Even 
the speaking parts were said in 
verse rather than in prose.
Suspense 
Chi Omega’s skit differed from 
others presented in that it had an 
element of suspense. Original and 
effective use of pauses held the 
audience’s attention during this 
professional - type performance. 
Particularly novel was the re­
mark by narrator Ellen Travolta, 
“Mirror, mirror on the wall— 
Who needs you?”
“The Black Spot” was the 
theme of Kappa Kappa Gamma. 
The Spot, played by Nancy Mc­
Carthy, made an indelible impres­
sion on the audience.
Andrew Carnegie 
Tri Delta urged everyone to 
attend the Homecoming game by 
developing “The Golden Touch­
down” as their theme. Janet 
j Young played Andrew Carnegie,
| who came back to give the team 
a pep talk.
“Those Who Know Go Below,” 
was the theme of AEPhi. Dressed 
as Tech football players, they 
gave the faculty and student com­
mittees an amusing dig.
Kappa Alpha Theta used a 
Scottish background to develop 
their theme, “The Curse of the 
Century.” Their skit had the 
most numerous props and the cos­
tumes were very colorful.
Homecoming Queen and Court
Janet Conrad and Lana Kubasek stand beside Suzie Bradford 
shortly after the coronation.
a football field with a triumphant 
Jack standing on his chest. The 
sound track during this scene con­
sisted of Jack’s answer to the 
Giant’s threat, the sound of a 
crash and a victory song. The 
castle was surrounded by a field 
of flowers in which stood three 
heralds.
Beta Theta Pi
The third place trophy was 
awarded Beta Theta Pi for their 
display, “The Flying Dutchman.” 
This display showed a rooking 
ship seen through two stone cliffs. 
On one cliff stood the Flying 
Dutchman’s lover, whose back 
was turned to a rejected man 
representing Geneva and whose 
arms were outstretched to the 
Dutchman, standing on the deck 
of the ship and representative of 
Tech. The ship’s masts were top­
ped by flags welcoming alumni.
A fourth display must be men­
tioned although it did not place 
in the competition, (perhaps be­
cause it was not entered.) It won 
the .title of toeing one of the 
humorous displays on campus.
Displays
[continued from page I] 
trumpeting of two heralds who 
stood on either side of the dis­
play, and the reading of the story 
into which was inserted the sound 
of a bagpipe, signifying the 
piper’s music.
Alpha Tau Omega 
Alpha Tau Omega was award­
ed second place for its display cen­
tered around the theme of Jack, 
the Giant-killer. The display con­
sisted of a castle with two scenes.
The first scene was that of the 
Giant holding a club over his 
shoulder and Jack in the palm of 
his hand. This scene was accom­
panied by the sound track, with 
Jack saying, “Though I lodge with 
you this night, you shall not see 
the morning’s light, my club shall 
dash your brains outright.”
This inscription was also print- 
ed on the back of the closed draw­
bridge which opened to show the 
second scene. This consisted of the

Wealth And Poverty
The appearance of the nation’s masked youth collecting 
monies for UNICEF on All Hallow’s Eve proved a sharp re­
minder of the relative poverty of the majority of the world’s 
peoples. In contrast to this the past weekend also provided 
two disturbing manifestations of our own wealth. In front 
of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity’s clubhouse, was seen 
a 1959 model Cadillac automobile. While the Cadillac has 
always been a symbol of attainment for the materialistic 
and the new rich, it has this year exceeded all bounds by a 
phenomenal display of useless chromium and illogical appen­
dices of sculptured steel. Moreover, the 22-foot “new stand­
ard of motoring majesty” proved to be as unfunctional as it 
is ostentatious. Seating space is at a minimum. Parking would 
require the skill of a teamster, and a gracious entrance and 
exit could only be accomplished by a diminutive lady in loose 
slacks.
It is distressing that the economic well-being of the U.S. 
is so dependent upon the motoring public’s search for annual 
novelty rather than luxurious efficiency. The present Cad­
illac, representing as it does the taste and desires of the 
American people and the awful necessity of the automobile 
industry to the economy stands as a symbol of our nation’s 
aims and goals in the mid-twentieth century. To remain sol­
vent and prosperous America must continually increase her 
production by means of planned obsolescence in manufactur­
ed commodities. While the nation’s school are physically out­
moded her teachers underpaid, her cities inadequate, and her 
roads congested, our best minds are concerned primarily with 
the design and production of luxuries. We are ill-advised to 
wonder why the underdeveloped peoples of the world turn to 
communism when on the one hand we bellow about giveaway 
foreign aid programs and on the other we shell out $5,000 for 
the latest rubber-tired confection from Detroit.
To return to Pittsburgh, amongst all the displays erected 
for Homecoming Weekend, one stood out as particularly 
ostentatious and expensive. Enquiry revealed that the costs 
involved were well over $1,000. Was this really necessary? I 
suggest that there are families in Asia who could have lived 
for a year on that $1,000. I suggest that the labor involved in 
the erection of the grandiose and gaudy monument could 
have swept clean and painted a city block in the slum sec­
tions of Oakland. It is to be hoped that officialdom will make 
some effort to curb such excess in the future.
Thorsten Veblen spoke of a manifestation of wealth 
which he called “Conspicuous Consumption” prevalent 
amongst the powerful and the rich..America is both powerful 
and rich and the scene on the corner of Morewood and Forbes 
was a sad illustration of Mr. Veblen’s proposition.

Carnegie Tech’s Nikolai Lopat- 
nikoff will have his new work, 
“Variazioni Concertanti,” present­
ed by the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Friday, November 7 and Sunday, 
November 9. Samuel Thaviu will 
be the featured solo violinist.
This program should be of spe­
cial appeal to the Carnegie Tech 
student body because of the tre­
mendous local is significance. Ac­
cording to the Pittsburgh Press, 
“more than 75 writers from this 
country and four other nations 
will critically appraise this new 
composition of Lopatnikoff’s,” This 
statement stresses the importance 
of this premiere in the musical 
world.
The new work by Lopatnikoff is 
part of the concert program of 
the Pittsburgh Symphony for this 
week which also incltides the ap­
pearance of concertmaster Sam­
uel Thaviu as featured soloist.
Thaviu will play the Walton Vio­
lin Concerto and Mozart’s Sym­
phony No. 39 and Wagner’s Over­
ture to “The Flying Dutchman” 
will also be heard. But the at­
tention will naturally be center­
ed on the world premiere per­
formance of Variazioni Concer­
tanti and the subsequent reac­
tion of the assembled critics.
The previously unheard com­
position has been commissioned 
by the Pittsburgh Symphony So­
ciety Under a grant of the Pitts­
burgh Bicentennial Committee. 
The visiting music arbiters will be 
in Pittsburgh for three days for 
the annual meetings of the Music 
Critics Association. Their visit is 
sponsored by the Pittsburgh 
Newspapers Publishing Associa­
tion, the American Symphony Or­
chestra League and the Pitts­
burgh Symphony Society.

of Music will sponsor the Gilimar

Student Congress 
Committee Heads* 
Bi-Weekly Meeting
By Terrie Rudy
Last Wednesday, October 29, the 
committee heads of Student Con­
gress met for their bi-weekly 
meeting at which the agenda for 
today's meeting was prepared.
The committee reports given 
were those of the Homecoming, 
Public Relations, Finance, Activi­
ties, and Leadership committees.
During the Homecoming report 
it was announced that posters ad­
vertising the festivities were going 
up that day. Everything for the 
weekend was running smoothly; 
and all of the last minute details, 
like setting up the microphones in 
the gym for Carnegie Day and the 
dance, were being taken care of.
The Public Relations report an­
nounced that the committee had 
two representatives publicizing 
Student Congress on the Tartan. 
They are Betsy Moss and Terrie 
Rudy. This committee has taken 
on the responsibility of handling 
a publicity seminar for all campus 
organizations which will be held 
about two weeks after Homecom­
ing.
It was proposed by the Finance 
Committee that Student Congress 
lend $836 for the Military Ball 
this year. The dance will be on 
March 21 and has been declared 
as an all-school function. This 
year the dance will be held off 
campus in Oakland. The proposed 
ticket price will be $3.50. Fred 
Ford will appear before Student 
Congress this afternoon to explain 
more about the dance.
Several sub-committees have 
been appointed by the Activities 
Committee. Fran Chleboski and 
Wade Biggs will be in charge of 
sending groups constitution, elec-

Blenheim Warned
Dear Blenheim:
You make more noise than a loose out-house door swing­
ing on a windy day in pumpkin season. For one who travgls 
incognito you sure have a lot to say about subjects on which 
you seem to have no knowledge. At least if you do, you 
don’t demonstrate It. ? —— -----------‘-------------------------------
II
Let it be clearly understood that 
I agree with your interpretation of 
Orval’s action. His extremes were 
entirely uncalled for; but when 
you compare him to Byrd and Al­
mond and what you call the typi­
cal southern attitude you display 
your ignorance of the south. First 
of all the “War Between The 
States” was not fought over the 
question of slavery.
Not Slavery
Historical research will show 
you that this question was simply 
an excuse for the war; that the ac­
tual causes wrent much deeper. 
(By the way, you might aste your 
Yankee New England ship cap­
tains how they found their Afri- 
can-Virginian excursion trips). 
Secondly, to return to the popu­
larly elected representatives of the 
south; when you call, may I quote, 
Harry Byrd, Lindsay Almond, 
James Byrnes, and “Kissin’ Jim” 
Folson, vile and rotten, I suggest 
you back up your opinions.
In the future 1 would appreciate 
it if you would stick closer to a 
subject on which you are well 
versed. You obviously have a true 
feeling for democracy, which is 
healthy in a young college student, 
though at the same time you have 
no interest in its implications. One 
must take into account conditions 
and environment and not expect 
changes to take place overnight.
You are traveling an idealistic 
road as do most Yankees who have 
mot taken the time or trouble to 
examine conditions in the south. 
But I shall not go into a discussion 
on segregation at this time.
I would however like to say that 
when you describe the vileness of
the south you might find it inter­
esting to compare it to the passion 
of a love-hungry young Yankee 
soldier that drank his way through 
Georgia.
I hope to see more of your writ­
ing ambitions the next time your 
anger flares arid your bea+'«ng 
heart meets the challenge of a new 
tyrant. Summing up, Blenheim, 
you mean well. Your heart is in 
the right place, but I suggest that 
next time you try putting it in 
your work.'
Your most humble reader,
The Gray Ghost.
(P. S.—Since the writer travels 
incognito I think it the privelege 
of the reader to do the same at 
least until he over reaches -Hs 
subject.)
Demagogues
Editor, the Tartan:
Despite his usual incisive thor­
oughness, Blenheim last week 
neglected to mention one of Gov­
ernor Faubus’ most prominent as­
sociations: Orval Faubus is a De­
mocrat; indeed, a Democrat in ‘X1»e 
tradition of the great power- 
hungry demagogues of the Demo­
crat (sic) party past and present, 
F. D. Roosevelt and H. S. Truman.

tions, and officers. Jackie Thurs­
ton has been placed in charge of 
checking the bulletin boards in 
AH.
The Leadership Commtitee pro­
posed that Student Congress in­
vite any interested freshmen to 
attend the Congress meeting on
November 19. At this meeting the 
committee heads could give a brief 
summary of what their respective 
committees did. After this meet­
ing the freshmen could discuss 
what they saw and perhaps sign 
up as committee apprentices at 
this time.

Geneva Defeats 
Tartan Gridiron 
Team In 40-6 Win
By Mike Berman
A strong Geneva offense team­
ed up with Harpo the Hexer to 
put a double whammy on the 
Tartan grid men Saturday.
Some 3,500 Homecoming fans 
were on hand to watch the Tar­
tans lose to Geneva 40-6. 
Throughout the game Tech was 
plagued with fumbles and inter­
ceptions which put a damper on 
every attack. Geneva, working 
much like the well known Okla­
homa team, used no middle but 
rather worked plays right from 
scrimmage, often catching the 
Tartan defense cat-napping. Ge­
neva kept to the ground through­
out most of the game, continually 
opening up gaps in the Tartan 
line. Tech was forced to take to 
the air in the closing minutes in 
an effort to do some late scoring.
Tech Breaks Ice
Geneva won the toss and elect­
ed to receive. After two running 
plays, which netted them little 
yardage, the Covies had the ball 
on their own 49. A fumble recov­
ered by Jim Temmel, gave the 
Plaids first and ten on their own 
39. From there Muth took the 
snap and charged ten more for 
another first. Tech’s march was 
foiled there forcing Muth to punt. 
He drove a long high kick which 
rolled dead on the Geneva 5 yard 
line.
The big Tech break came mo­
ments later when Geneva Q.B. Joe 
Denone fumbled on his own eight 
and Tartan defenseman Bob Ham­
mer recovered. The Skibos march­
ed to the two where a Muth to 
Jones handoff was good for the 
touchdown. The conversion at­
tempt was short and Tech led 
midway through the first quarter, 
6-0.
Geneva Bounces Back
The Tartans’ lead was short liv­
ed for within 5 minutes the Covies 
took the lead on a pass play that 
covered 35 yards. Geneva took the 
Tartan kickoff at their 27 and on 
a series of first downs marched

Grove City had the next three 
placed, closely followed by three 
more Tech men—Bruce Dobras, 
Woody Fritz, and Bill Anderson. 
Freshman Dave Degenhardt who 
started the season as tenth man 
finished seventh for Tech in this 
meet just nosing out Glenn

Geneva Wastes No Time
Shortly after the start of the 
second period Muth was to punt. 
Geneva took the ball on their own 
46 and marched up to mid-field. 
The Covies, finding the Tech de­
fense weak, punched a hole in the 
right side where right half, Willie 
Taylor, went through for 50 yards 
and a second Geneva T.D. The 
score was 14-6 after just 2 min­

Citcom Takes Lead 
"In Pirate League
By Ed Blum
In a battle of undefeated titans, Citcom overwhelmed 
Kappa Sigma 23-12 to take first place in the Pirate IM foot­
ball league. The victory left Citcom with an unblemished 
5-0 record, while dropping Kappa Sigma into second place
with 4-1. Both Sigma Nu A and< 
Theta Xi added victories to stay 
^abreast of the lead in the Yankee 
league, and the situation in the 
Brooklyn league remained un­
changed, with the Met Grads still 
leading ATO by one game.
First Quarter 
Citcom scored first against Kap­
pa Sigma, and held a secure lead 
throughout the entire game. Early 
in the first quarter, one of Kappa 
Sig quarterback Lee Hildebrand’s 
passes was blocked, and then in- 
% tercepted by Gary Pallone for Cit­
com on the Kappa Sigma 10. Two 
plays later, commuter Bob Murphy 
latteralled to halfback Bob Beitle, 
who then pitched a flat pass to 
Murphy for the touchdown. Cit­
com led 7-0 at the end of the first 
half.
Third Quarter
Trailing 8-0 in the third quarter, 
Kappa Sigma launched a desper- 
ation play, and on fourth down, 
9 Hildebrand connected 'with Jim 
Renaldo on a 50 yard scoring pass. 
But Citcom roared back. After
completing several passes, tailback 
Murphy raced 20 yards around 
right end, outrunning the Kappa 
Sig secondary for the touchdown. 
Then, only a few minutes later, 
Murphy again tallied on a long 
run, this time on a sprint 60 yards 
up the left sideline to put Citcom 
ahead 18-6.
In the fourth quarter, Kappa Sig 
halfback Jerry Watson, taking the 
ball on a pitchout, tossed a scoring 
pass to Jim Renaldo to bring the 
score to 18-12. Not wanting to risk 
anything, however, Citcom added 
a clinching touchdqwn, again on 
the lateral to Beitle and flat pass 
to Murphy who scored his fourth 
touchdown of the afternoon.
Citcom’s passing was sure and 
accurate, in contrast to the some­
what more harried passes thrown 
by Kappa Sigma, which sorely felt 
the loss of all-school quarterback 
Lou Montini, But both teams will 
be in the finals, and they each 
stand a good chance of coming out 
of the heap on top.

or oral, and that it is therefore 
very difficult to determine which 
activities are in violation.
ATO also said that the hayride 
was organized entirely by two in­
dividuals, was attended by less 
than one third of the members, 
and was in no way connected with 
the name of or sponsored by the 
fraternity, either officially of un­
officially.
For this reason, ATO stated, the 
event was not a fraternity event 
or a school social event, and was 
similar to such activities as pat­
ties held in private homes or at­
tendance at other colleges’ party 
weekends, which have never been 
considered fraternity or school 
events.
The Court said that any large 
group of members of one frater­
nity gathered together for social 
purposes is necessarily identifi­
able with the fraternity and is 
thus a violation of social proba­
tion.
Circumventing the Court
The Court also said that the 
hayride constituted an attempt to 
circumvent the Court and was a 
threat to the authority of that 
body and to the strength of the
fraternity system as a whole. No 
mention wras made in the decision 
of the stag party charge.
ATO was put on a week's social 
probation last spring for activi­
ties occuring after the Spring Car­
nival buggy finals, held early one 
morning. The three weeks served 
this fall were for the original pen­
alty given by the Court at the 
request of Dr. Raymond Parshal, 
then Director of Student Person­
nel and Welfare, who was not sat­
isfied with the previous penalty.
Appeal
The court met Thursday, Octo­
ber 23, to hear the defense and 
again on Monday, October 27, to 
determine the verdict. ATO en­
tered an appeal with Dr. George 
K. Brown, present Director of Stu­
dent Personnel and Welfare last 
Friday.
The CFP Court is composed of 
six justices, three fraternity mem­
bers and three faculty representa­
tives: They are: Robert C. Pat­
ten, CFP Justice, Acting Chief 
Justice; Robert Larson, CFP Al­
ternate Justice; Richard Sphon, 
CFP Emergency Justice; and Dr. 
Robert R. Rothfus, Mr. Earle R. 
Swank, and Dr. Alvin S. Wein-

fourth Geneva T.D. They led at 
half time 27-6.
Revived Tech Hopes 
Shortly after the opening, sec­
ond half, kickoff, Covy defense- 
man Jim Mastasi intercepted a 
Muth pass and ran it back to the 
Skibo’s 15. A strong Tartan wall 
held the Covy elevent at the ten 
where Tech took over. After three 
passing plays failed Muth was 
forced to kick. Mastasi fumbled 
the book and Tech center Jim 
the ball and Tech center Jim 
Temmel recovered on Geneva’s 28. 
The Tartans were on the offense 
for a change, but they were im­
mediately halted at the 23. After 
another barage of punts, Tech had 
the ball on Geneva’s 27. Three 
handoff plays brought Tech to the
14. Tech was gain challenging un­
til Muth’s intended pass to Poad 
was intercepted by Covy safety- 
man Larry Zeh who ran it back 
to the 24.
One More For the Road 
After a Geneva punt put Tech 
on its own goal line, Q.B. Muth 
fumbled the snap from center, and 
Geneva recovered on Tech’s 2 
yard line. On two plays Covy Q.B. 
Don Chewning barrelled over for 
the finale handing the Tartans a 
40-6 Homecoming defeat.
The game was played under 
high school rules with unlimited 
substitutions allowed and only 
one point attempt allowed after 
touchdowns. Next week Tech with 
a 4-2 record meets strong Frank­
lin and Marshall in an away game.

College Students 
Find It Easier 
To Make Loans
“Go Now—Pay Later” is the 
advice given more and more col­
lege students, according to a study 
published today by The College 
life Insurance Company of Amer-
5ica‘The study concerned itself with 
student guaranty funds recently 
created in Massachusetts, Maine, 
and New York, and concluded 
that the establishment of private 
and governmental funds to guar­
antee long-term, low-cost, unse­
cured bank loans to college stu­
dents is a new and revolutionary 
development.
$1,463,000 
jp The Massachusetts Higher Ed­
ucation Assistance Corporation, 
which did not begin operations 
until March 1957, has now guar­
anteed more than $1,463,000 in 
loans to 3,365 students. The max­
imum loan in any one year is 
$500 and the maximum total $1,- 
500.
The New York plan, which did 
not become effective until, the 
current schpol year, by October 
al 9 already had guaranteed 2,311
I loans for $1,370,000. It permits
up to $1,000 in annual loans and 
up to $5,000 in total loans for any 
one student. Loans in both states 
are made directly by participat­
ing banks.
Repayments
Loan repayments under the 
three plans typically begin rather 
soon after graduation and may be 
spread over a three- to six-year 
1% period. Interest rates range from 
3%% to 51/2%.
Special legislation enacted in 
these states gives minors full legal 
capacity to act in their own be­
half and to be bound for their 
debt.
New Idea
Commenting on the study, John 
Burkhart, pa-esident of College 
Life, stated that borrowing for a 
$4,000 car is widely practiced and 
f# widely accepted, while borrowing 
for a $4,000 education is relatively 
new.
He interpreted the trend to­
ward loans as a desirable lessen­
ing of exclusive reliance on schol­
arships and as providing corres­
pondingly larger suras for pay­
ments of faculty salaries and im­
provement of educational serv­
ice.
Carnegie Inst. 
Keeps Modern
Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, 
Pa., is keeping abreast of modern 
developments in museum tech­
niques, is installing the LecTour 
system which will be ready for 
the opening of the celebration 
of the 1958 Pittsburgh Interna­
tional Exhibition of Contempor­
ary Painting and Sculpture on 
December 5, and at the same time 
will be available to visitors to 
natural history exhibits.
Installation of the LecTour sys­
tem has been made possible 
through a special grant from The 
A. W. Mellon Educational and 
Charitable Trust, and is to be a 
permanent part of the service of­
fered by Carnegie Institute to 
the public.
Second Museum
Carnegie Institute is the second 
museum to install this specific au­
tomatic electronic guide system, 
following the National Gallery of 
Art in Washington, D. C., where 
such an installation has proved 
bith practical and extremely pop­
ular.
Visitors to Carnegie Institute 
will be to rent receivers with ear­
phones and listen to broadcasts on 
paintings in the art galleries, col­
lections displayed in the Decora­
tive Arts, Dinosaur, and Marine 
Halls, and the exhibit “Deadline 
for. Wildlife.”
Visitors
The visitor, after securing a re­
ceiver and earphone at the en­
trance to the building, may start 
at the exhibit area of his choice. 
He may then proceed to any of 
the specially prepared rooms 
where LecTour is installed. He 
will hear a recorded explanation 
of each display in turn, prepared 
by specialists in their fields.
The LecTour system will not 
replace any of the regular or spe­
cial guide services now offered 
to the public by the Division of 
Education of the Institute, but 
will supplement the guided tours 
by permitting individuals to enjoy 
further details of description and 
'history of the exhibits.

A college senior once remarked to a Bell System inter­
viewer: “A telephone career must be a mirage. I hear talk 
about fabulous training, fascinating work, grade-A job se- 
' curity, and rapid advancement in management. Sounds a 
bit too rosy. What’s the real story?”
The interviewer knew mere talk wouldn’t sell a skeptic. 
So he showed him some “profiles” of recent college graduates 
who had enjoyed that fabulous training,. had worked at 
intriguing jobs, and had won early management promotions.
Our once-skeptical friend has been with the Bell System 
3 years now—and is currently supervising the work of 55 
people.
We’ve converted a host of Doubting Thomases. Whether 
doubtful or not, you 11 learn a lot about rewarding telephone 
careers by talking with the Bell System interviewer when he

swan was'Jan Conrad.
“The second swan then an­
swered him, ‘When in the courtly 
robes I’ll sit, I promise you a 
lively wit.’ That swan was Lana 
Kubasek. The third swan then 
quietly replied, ‘My winning smile 
a charming wit, and beauty I will 
now submit.’ The third swan was 
Suzie Bradford. ‘To you,’ said 
Harpo to the third, ‘goes the 
crown. May you reign forever in 
renown.’
As each of the finalists was in­
troduced, the wings of her swan 
unfolded, whereupon a swarm of 
cameramen converged upon the 
float trying for a good picture. 
The girls were presented in for­
mal gowns, which added to the 
pomp of the ceremony.
The beauty of the pageant sub­
ordinated the performances of 
Geneva’s marching band and our 
Kiltie Band, which both offered 
an excellent appearance. Geneva’s 
musicians led by five majorettes 
presented a selection of songs, 
each accompanied by an appro­
priate picture formation.
Among the numbers presented 
by the group were “Shine on 
Harvest Moon” during which the 
band formed a horn of plenty, 
“On the Street Where You Live”

be excellent and the show to be

Moyer—
[continued from page I]
This result, Dr. Moyer explain­
ed, may be accounted for by the 
fact that the adrenal gland has 
two parts, the cortex and the 
medulla which have differing ef­
fects on transmission in the sym­
pathetic nervous system. The cor­
tex apparently aids in automatic 
or sympathetic nerve transmission, 
while the medulla tends to in­
hibit it.
One interpretation of Dr. Moy­
er’s results could be that when the 
entire adrenal gland is removed 
both its facilitating and inhibiting 
effects are gone and the inhibiting
