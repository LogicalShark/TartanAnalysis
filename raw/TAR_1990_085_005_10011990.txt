Comp Sei 
marks 25th
By RHONDA STRUMINGER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon’s School of 
Computer Science marked its 
25th year last week with a three- 
day symposium. Since the school’s 
founding, it has risen to beecome 
one of the top three computer 
science schools in the world.
Among the distinguished men 
and women speakers were Uni­
versity Professor of Computer 
Science and Psychology Herbert 
A. Simon and University Profes­
sor of Computer Science Allen 
Newell. Along with the late Alan Perlis, past Chairman of the 
graduate department of Com­
puter Science, these men were 
vital in the formation of the de­
partment.
“For 35 years A1 Newell and I 
had a firm belief that computers 
were the most important thing 
that happened to humankind 
since the discovery of writing,”
said Simon, CMU’s only Nobel 
Laureate. “With the marvelous 
development of computer science 
in the succeeding years, that be­
lief has been confirmed. It is a 
great satisfaction to know that we 
have helped build one of the lead­
ing computer science research and 
teaching enterprises in the world, 
an enterprise that has maintained 
its leadership for a whole human 
generation.”
According to Newell, the Com­
puter Science Department grew 
out of an interdisciplinary program 
in Systems and Communications 
Sciences, formed in 1961. “None of 
us had primary goals or visions of 
the building of the large institution 
of CS. We have always been fo­
cused on the nature of the science 
and technology and simply lekthe 
institution grow in response to the 
urge to do the science,” he said.

warming occasion that revealed

[Lawyer speaks on IsraelCar hits student
By LAURIE WILKISON
Tartan Staffwriter
¦ Lea Tsemel, an Israeli lawyer 
and a member of the Israeli 
Association For Human Rights, 
spoke to a group of about 50 
students and faculty in the 
Wherrett Room Thursday night 
on the continuing state of con­
flict between the Israelis and 
the Palestinians living in the 
occupied territories of the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Tsemel was introduced by 
freelance journalist Moe Seager, 
who recently traveled to Israel
to investigate the long-stand­
ing conflict for himself. “The 
severity of the problem between 
the State of Israel and the Pal­
estinian people is much, much 
more critical than I had antici­
pated with all the reading I had 
done,” he said.
Tsemel has defended thou­
sands of Palestinians and been 
politically active for the last 20 
years. Yet Tsemel says that up 
until the Intifada, the organized 
uprising by Palestinians to­
wards Israeli occupation which 
began at the end of 1987, she 
was considered a “traitor” and a
“terrorist lawyer.”
“All of a sudden, I became a 
human rights lawyer — all of a 
sudden, Palestinians became 
human,” she said. “I am very 
proud to be in the new category, 
although I was very proud to be 
in the old category.”
Tsemel, who is of Jewish origin 
and lives in Israel, said that the 
question for her is “How do I 
coexist in the place that I want to 
live?” “I separated from my Zi­
onism,” she said. “I can under­
stand the Palestinians.”

physics major 
Ravish Momin 
was struck by a 
car late Satur­
day night while 
crossing Forbes Avenue to­
ward Morewood Gardens.
According to Sergeant 
Frances Russ of Campus Po­
lice, Momin was “trying to 
beat the light.” He was struck 
by a vehicle coming up Forbes 
Avenue from Oakland.
While being examined, 
Momin said that his head hurt 
and that he felt nauseated. He 
was transported via ambu­
lance to Presbyterian Univer­

Momin was released from 
the hospital early on Sunday, 
and is at home and in good 
condition.
According to Russ, it was not 
known at press time Sunday 
whether or not alcohol was 
involved in the incident.
According to Momin, the 
driver of the car may have been 
under the influence of alcohol.

Next year’s freshmen recipients 
of the Carnegie Tradition Award 
may receive half-tuition scholar­
ships instead of fixed dollar 
amounts.
Last year’s winners of the four- 
year award receive $3,000 each 
year, while this year’s winners 
receive $5,000 eachyear. The new 
system of awards is flexible: if 
tuition goes up in the next four 
years, the amount of the scholar­
ship will as well, to remain at the 
half-tuition level.
The award, which began just 
two years ago, has given 107 
scholarships. It is offered to ac­
cepted freshmen based on their 
academic record, leadership, and 
involvement in high school.
Some of the recipients in those 
first two years of existance are 
upset with these changes in the 
value of the scholarship.
“Quite a few people at the 
meeting were upset,” said sopho­
more Dina Krause, a chemical
engineering major. “Personally, 
I’m not. There’s not a lot that can 
be done at this point.”
Tom Keating, director of the

didn’t care, some were inquisitive, 
and some were obivously upset at

Senators
approveSouter
WASHINGTON (DJ) — 
The Senate Judiciary Com­
mittee approved the nomina­
tion of Judge David Souter 
for the Supreme Court by a 
13-1 vote on Thursday.
Senator Edward Kennedy, 
D-Mass, was the only vote 
against the nominee.
The full Senate is expected 
to vote on the nomination this 
week.
Four liberal senators said 
they will vote against con­
firming the nomination of 
Souter to the Supreme Court, 
based on his failure to en­
dorse a woman’s right to 
abortion.
“The right of privacy is a 
basic promise of American 
life,” said Senator Bill Brad­
ley (D-N.J.). “We should not 
entrust it to a jurist who 
cannot agree whether it ex­
ists or to whom it applies.”
Bradley was joined by New 
Jersey Democratic colleague 
Frank Lautenberg and Bar­
bara Mikulski (D-Md.), one of 
two women in the Senate. 
Mikulski said that because 
Souter refused to state his 
position on abortion, “we must 
fear the worst.”
The announcements 
brought to only four the 
number of senators to publicly 
oppose President Bush’s 
nominee. Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.) last Monday became 
the first senator to say he 
would vote against Souter.
Budget compromise hikes gasoline tax
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi­
dent Bush and Congressional 
leaders announced a compromise 
agreement on a federal deficit 
reduction plan early yesterday 
afternoon at the White House.
The plan, which came only 
hours before automatic spending 
cuts mandated by the Gramm- 
Rudman law would have taken 
effect, reduces the deficit by $500
billion over the next five years.
The plan calls for the generation 
of new revenues—$134 billion— 
in the form of tax increases, the 
largest of which is an increase in 
the gasoline tax. The increase in 
the gasoline tax would be phased 
in as a nickel increase for each of 
the next five years.
The compromise also includes 
$300 billion in spending cuts, in­
cluding cuts in defense spending. 
Social Security cost of living ad­
justments remain untouched.
Other taxes hiked by the plan 
include those on cigarettes, beer, 
wine, and liquor. Yet another tax 
is created by the plan — one that 
levies a ten percent fee on such 
luxury items as luxury cars, jew­
elry, and electronics.
Bush, who once vowed not to
raise taxes, said that he doesn’t 
welcome the tax increases but 
thinks they are necessary to cut 
the budget deficit. He also said 
the tax on gasoline will help to 
curb the dependence of the U.S. 
on foreign oil.
The plan lacks the capital gains 
tax cut sought by Bush.
While all those involved in the 
negotiations admitted not having
gotten everything they wanted 
out of the talks, they affirmed 
their belief that the package wa^ 
for the good of the nation.
Each of them echoed the senti^ 
ments of Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell (D-Maine) who 
said, “now comes the hard part,’} 
reflecting his belief that obtaining 
majority support for the bill woufi 
not be easy.
Iraqi appeals come amidst tightening of sanctions
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Iraq’s foreign 
minister made a surprise appearance in 
Jordan Saturday, giving rise to specula­
tion Saddam Hussein might be looking for 
a new way to get around the ever-tightening 
economic embargo.
Meanwhile, the multinational force in 
the region — dispatched to protect Saudi 
Arabia after Hussein’s takeover of Kuwait 
August 2 — gathered strength.
Britain launched a deployment that was 
to include thousands of ground troops, and 
Egyptian reinforcements were on their 
way to the region as well. Also, the first 
French Foreign Legion soldiers arrived in 
Saudi Arabia.
France warned Saturday that it would 
retaliate if it turns out that Iraq was be­
hind a grenade attack that killed a French 
child and injured 17 others Thursday night 
in Djibouti, a small Red Sea country pro­
viding support bases for French forces.
In Washington on Friday, National Se­
curity Advisor Brent Scowcroft said Presi­
dent Bush has the option of calling for 
U.N. military action in the Persian Gulf if 
Iraq continues to pillage occupied Kuwait 
and cuts off food to foreign nationals in 
Iraq as threatened.
The Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, 
spent only a few hours in Amman, Jordan, 
meeting with King Hussein at the royal 
palace and then returning to Baghdad.
A Jordanian cabinet official said Aziz
It was not known whether Aziz sought a loosen­
ing of the embargo in his talks with the Jorda­
nian leader Saturday, but Baghdad is believed 
to have made similar overtures to Iran....
carried a message from Saddam Hussein 
regarding the “tense situation” in the Per­
sian Gulf.
After the meeting, the official described 
the visit as “important, especially in this 
period” but refused to disclose any specif­
ics. King Hussein has said repeatedly the 
Arabs should find a diplomatic solution to 
the gulf crisis.
Jordan has been battered economically 
by the sanctions, and agreed only reluc­
tantly to abide by them. It was not known 
whether Aziz sought a loosening of the 
embargo in his talks with the Jordanian 
leader Saturday, but Baghdad is believed 
to have made similar overtures to Iran, 
with which it recently patched up rela­
tions.
Although Jordan condemned the Iraqi 
invasion, it has also spoken out strongly 
against the U.S.-led foreign military de­
ployment in the region.
In the Arabian desert, both sides have 
been firmly dug in. The United States has
sent about 165,000 soldiers, most of them 
to Saudi Arabia, and the Pentagon said 
this week that Iraq had boosted its forces 
to 430,000 in and around Kuwait.
The first units of the French Foreign 
Legion arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday, 
joining the largest deployment of French 
forces overseas since Algeria’s war of inde­
pendence, which lasted from 1954-62. The 
bulk of French groundforces—4,000 troops 
— arrived yesterday.
France will have about 13,000 troops in 
and around Saudi Arabia when the cur­
rent deployment is completed.
Meanwhile, a month-long British de­
ployment of up to 9,000 ground forces is 
under way, British officials said.
Egyptian military sources said Satur­
day that about 1,000 Egyptian soldiers 
had left the port of Alexandria for Saudi 
Arabia.
Additional units will be sent this week, 
the Egyptian source said, bringing the 
Egyptian force to about 14,000.
Terrorist vows 
to attack U.S.
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A radical, 
Palestinian leader who sabotaged the 
U.S.-Palestine Liberation Organiza­
tion dialogue earlier this year report­
edly vowed today to strike at American 
interests “all over planet earth” if any 
Iraqi aircraft was attacked to enforce 
the air embargo of Iraq.
“America is the No. 1 terrorist1 
country,” the official Iraqi News Agency' 
(INA) quoted Mohammed Abbas]!1 
leader of the Palestine Liberation 
Front, as saying.
“The U.S. administration’s decisions 
— which it imposed on the United 
Nations — for a land, sea and air 
blockade of Iraq is an overt act of 
aggression,” INA, monitored in 
Nicosia, quoted him as saying during a 
meetingin Baghdad with Iraq’s deputy 
Prime Minister TahaYassin Ramadan.
“Any terrorist act America and its 
allies commit against any Iraqi aircraft 
in the air or anywhere else will be 
avenged by similar, or even stronger 
actions all over planet earth,” Abbas, 
also known as Abul Abbas, said.
Economist downplays anticipated decline in major economic indicators
NEW YORK (DJ) — The index 
of leading indicators tied a ribbon 
around a package that everybody 
knew was a booby prize.
In sum, the sharp 1.2 percent 
drop in the index in August was 
no surprise, but it wraps up suc­
cinctly the case for an already 
weak economy budding at the 
prospect of war in the Persian 
Gulf.
Stock prices and consumer con­
fidence, both victims of Iraq’s 
August 2 invasion of Kuwait, ac­
counted for most of the decline.
September will likely prove to 
be little different.
“We have the directions of four 
of the (11) components,” says 
David Resler, chief economist at 
Nomura Securities International 
Inc. “Stock prices, M2, consumer 
expectations and unemployment 
insurance claims” will be nega­
tives for the September reading, 
he says.
Economists downplay the pre­
dictive power of the leading indi­
cators index and the bond market 
tends to ignore the number be­
cause most of the components al­
ready are known prior to the re­
port, but analysts are finding 
nuggets of insight in the latest 
release.
“What is significant about this 
report is that on a year-over-year 
basis, the leading indicators (in­
dex) is actually down,” says 
Charles Lieberman, managing 
director of financial markets re­
search at Manufacturers Hanover 
Securities Corp.
The index is notorious for send­
ing false signals because it tends
to predict more recessions than 
actually occur, Lieberman says.
A rule of thumb has been that 
three monthly declines in a row 
signal a recession is imminent, 
but the index has not declined 
even two months in a row in more 
than a year, Lieberman says.
“Despite that, the index has 
declined year-over-year,” 
Lieberman notes.
“This time around, we’re likely 
to get an economy showing a re­
cession without the leading indi­
cators showing any advance
warning,” Lieberman says.
“This is something that appeals 
to the mass public who aren’t fa­
miliar with economic data,” 
Lieberman adds. “Not the pros.” 
It stands to reason, though, that 
consumer confidence may get 
another jolt when citizens learn 
the government’s economic pre­
dictor sees tough times ahead.
The Treasury bond market 
wasn’t affected by the leading in­
dicators report at 8:30 am on 
Friday, but the market is moder­
ately higher as investors continue
to seek the security of U.S. Gov­
ernment securities amid concerns 
of a weakening economy.
The Treasury’s bellwether 30- 
year bond is up about 1/2 at 97 5/
8, yielding 8.97 percent.

Fraternities draw 'diverse’ pledges
By LAURIE WILKISON
Tartan Staffwriter
Friday night — pledge night — brought to 
a close the fall 1990 fraternity rush period, 
which, according to many Greeks, was one of 
the best in recent years.
Delta Upsilon got the largest pledge class, 
with 34 new pledges. Sophomore DU brother 
John Murphy said, “We concentrate really 
hard on rush and 95 percent of guys that were 
given bids accepted them.”
Inter-Fraternity Council President John 
Ginsburg said that overall, rush went really 
well and there were “no major incidents on 
pledge night.”
Senior Alpha Tau Omega brother A. J. Moret 
said, “The quality was there but not the 
quantity.” But, he added, “we’d rather have 
the 16 quality individuals that will enhance 
the Greek system than 25 guys that just join 
for the wrong reasons.” Moret was IFC rush 
chair this year.
Both Kappa Sigma and Sigma Nu received
10
Pi Lambda Phi President Gary McMasters 
said, “I’m happy with the numbers.” He de­
scribed the pledge class of 17 as a “good bunch 
of guys.”
Alpha Epsilon Pi received five pledges and 
vice-president Jeremy Eisen said, “We got 
really good quality ... really impressive.”
Phi Kappa Theta described their pledge 
class of 16 as “exceptional.”
A representative of Kappa Delta Rho said 
its nine pledges were “great” and a represen­
tative of Delta Tau Delta said the house had 
an “awesome rush.” DTD received 17 pledges 
and described them as a “diverse bunch of 
guys.”
Theta Xi received 18 new pledges.
A representative of Sigma Tau Gamma, 
which also had 18 bids accepted, said, “rush 
was great.” In five years, this was Sig Tau’s 
largest pledge class ever.
There was a feeling among some fraternity
brothers that the freshman class was not as 
pro-Greek or enthusiastic about rush this year. 
Rick Song of Sigma Alpha Epsilon said, “that 
just made us work a little harder.” SAE re­
ceived 20 pledges.
In reference to comments that the freshman 
class was not as enthusiastic towards the 
Greek system this year, Ginsburg said “It’s 
really hard to put a label on 1000 people.” He 
said he felt that the freshman did not know 
each other as well this year and therefore did 
not come over in big groups to meet the 
brothers.
Neither ATO or Beta Theta Pi are sure how 
many pledges they have because their bid 
nights were postponed due to an away football 
game.
“We didn’t get to enjoy a real pledge night,” 
said Beta brother Paul Stapleton. Joe Mauro, 
another brother, said he was “kind of disap­
pointed in the conflict of dates ... the schedul­
ing with the away football game really hurt 
Beta and ATO.”

the spirit of the department and 
the warm friendship it maintains. 
It was especially pleasant to meet 
\vith the many graduate students 
who returned — some of whom 
we see infrequently, but all of 
whose careers we follow with in­
terest and with pleasure in their 
success,” said Simon.
The anniversary was “a neat 
party with a neat set of talks that 
covered the breadth of computer 
science,” said Newell. The cel­
ebration had no theme because 
its planners decided that with the 
large number of diverse projects 
going on in SCS, any focus for the 
celebration would be too restric­
tive.
On Thursday, a campus-wide 
open house was offered both to 
students and to the general pub­
lic. There were lectures and dem­
onstrations to expose the commu­
nity to some of the work that the 
department has been doing, as 
well as a self-guided tour. The 
Planetary Rover and the Nav Lab, 
ALVINN, a computer-controlled 
self-directing van, were just two 
of the many attractions on the 
tour.
“The most significant and sad­
dest thing about the anniversary 
was that Alan Perlis, the first 
Computer Science Department 
head, was not here,” said Assis­
tant Dean for Development 
Catherine Copetas. “He passed 
away unexpectedly February 7 of 
this year.”
In memoriam, the anniversary 
celebration was dedicated to 
Perlis.
“It is because of Perlis’s inno­
vativeness and dedication as a 
computer scientist and as a pro­
fessional educator that the pro­
gram to date allows for maximum 
student freedom,” said Copetas.
In an interview with The Pitts­
burgh Press, SCS Dean Nico 
Habermann accredited Simon and 
Newell’s notion of artificial intel­
ligence for the possibilities “to 
apply computers universally.”
“The School of Computer Science is 
building connections among disci­
plines
— Nico Habermann, 
dean of SCS
The belief was that “computers 
could be made to process informa­
tion much like their creators.” 
Symposium Program Chair 
Mary Shaw, a professor of com­
puter science, claims that the 
success of the School of Computer 
Science rests with the people
working there.
“You can accomplish things here 
because of the sense of family and 
cooperation,” she said. “The re­
search of the department was ini­
tially built around information 
technology, now called artificial 
intelligence, but there are no re­
search boundaries here — yotf 
can work across different depart? 
ments.”
Shaw mentioned that the 
school’s projects include artifical 
intellegence, robotics, and others: 
“The School of Computer Scii 
ence is building connections 
among disciplines,” said Haber­
mann. “The symbolic processing 
of information is something thai 
has interest in itself, but it affects 
other disciplines in a similar way 
that mathematics affects physics 
and engineering.
“In a sense it is broader because 
information processing is not re­
stricted to just physics and engi^ 
neering. It applies to everything."
Crime and Incident Report
9/21 POLITICAL 
DISPUTE, 2:22 pm. A 
complainant reported that 
a Carnegie Mellon student 
had purposefully spilled 
soda on his LaRouche lit­
erature. A Campus Police 
officer in the area witnessed the student 
throw the remaining soda in the 
complainant’s face, causing a small al­
tercation. Campus Police could not de­
termine whether or not the soda was 
dropped on purpose.
| 9/21 FIRE ALARM, 9:31 pm. The 
Pittsburgh Bureau of Fires responded to 
&n alarm on the fourth floor of Morewood 
Gardens E tower. Officers found the area 
to be free of smoke and fire; persons 
unknown had apparently lit something 
under the smoke detector, as it was 
blackened.
; 9/21 SUSPICIOUS PERSON, 10:13 
pm. A Campus Police officer on patrol at 
Mellon Institute encountered a white 
man at the northeast corner of the 
building. The man, who was not affiliated 
with the University, said that he had 
just stopped there to get out of the rain 
and to rearrange some items which he
was carrying in a green garbage bag. 
Campus Police advised the man that the 
area is private property and that he 
would face the possibility of arrest if he 
were seen there in the future. Campus 
Police then asked the man to leave and 
he complied.
9/22 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 1:14 
am. A complainant notified Campus 
Police that persons unknown were 
throwing bottles out of the windows of 
Resnik Hall onto the track and field. 
Responding officers found broken beer 
bottles and glass on the track, field, and 
sidewalk near the Highlander Cafe.
9/22 MEDICAL, 2:43 am. A bunk bed 
in a room in Donner Hall collapsed, in­
juring two students who had been on the 
bottom bunk.' Two students had also been 
in the top bunk when it fell onto the 
lower bunk. One of the students in the 
lower bunk sustained a bruised right 
shoulder and a laceration to the bridge of 
the nose, and the other student suffered 
a two-inch cut to the top of the head. The 
students in the upper bunk were not 
injured. Campus Police transported the 
victims to Pittsburgh Presbyterian Uni­
versity Hospital.
9/22 ACCIDENT, 4:25 pm. A visitor 
to Carnegie Mellon was standing on the 
walkway bordering the sod at the center 
stadium stairway when she suddenly 
fell, rolled down the sod, and fell onto the 
track. The victim said that she felt a 
push as if someone had accidentally 
bumped her. She was wearing flat rub­
ber-soled shoes at the time and refused 
medical treatment.
9/23 ACCIDENT, 12:35 am. A stu­
dent was injured when the Wean Hall 
elevator in which he was riding stopped 
suddenly between floors. The student 
was knocked off balance and struck his 
head on the back railing of the elevator 
car. He sustained a two-inch laceration 
on his forehead and a cut on his nose. He 
was transported by friends to Montefiore 
Hospital.
9/23 THEFT/UNDERAGE POS­
SESSION OF ALCOHOL, 1:48 am. 
Campus Police noticed two people car­
rying a large orange Pittsburgh Post- 
Gazette newspaper machine from the 
Skibo driveway into the fraternity drive­
way. During the identification process, 
the men made light of the incident, offer­
ing to take the newspaper machine back
and saying that they wouldn’t have done 
this if they had only had three beers 
instead of four. Campus Police instructed 
them to take the machine back and to 
wait there for their citations. The men 
did return the machine, but instead of 
waiting for Campus Police to arrive, they 
ran across the field and disappeared 
between Resnik Hall and The West Wing. 
Citations have been issued through the 
Division of Student Affairs.
9/23 HARASSMENT BY COMMU­
NICATION, 5:59 am. A student called 
Campus Police to report that someone 
had called his room and asked to speak to 
his roommate. Upon finding that the 
roommate was not there, the caller re­
quested to leave a message about meet­
ing the roommate at the library. The 
caller then began to ask the student 
personal questions about himself and 
asked if they could get together. The 
student said that the caller’s voice was 
masculine at the beginning of the con­
versation but became feminine at the 
end. Campus Police advised the student 
to keep track of all calls and to contact 
them if the calls continue.
9/23 MEDICAL, 4:55 pm. A student
entered 155 Baker Hall saying that hé 
had just cut his fingers while working in 
the wood shop of Doherty Hall. He had 
cut the tips of the three middle fingers of 
his right had while operating an electric 
power jointer. Campus Police transported 
the student to Presbyterian University Hospital.
9/24 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 1:23 
am. Campus Police were notified that 
two women were spray painting thè 
sidewalk on Morewood Avenue near thè 
fraternities. The women had red and 
black spray paint and a wooden stencil in 
the shape of a stop sign which read “Stop 
Raping.” The two women said they were 
concerned about rapes which occur at 
the fraternities and wanted to “increase 
awareness” on campus. They were issued 
state citations for criminal mischief. ,
9/27 FIRE ALARM, 9:40 pm. Upon 
sighting smoke in Doherty Hall, Camr 
pus Police notified the Pittsburgh Bu­
reau of Fires. The source of the flames 
was not immediately obvious but may 
have come from the burning of some 
lumber in one of the architecture studios:

THE TARNAP S CARPEfaE cEeesP S r tuNsiER rnngB
Leftist
Israeli
lawyer
speaks
TSEMEL, from page 1
two months ago, when 
Saddam Hussein invaded 
Kuwait, “it seemed there was 
a growing consensus inside 
Israel for how to solve the 
problem of coexistence and 
self-determination.” Many of 
.-those of the Israeli Left, how­
ever, were discouraged by the 
Palestinians’ open celebration 
Of the invasion, she said. She 
described Hussein’s act as 
.“double-faced” for the Pales­
tinians, meaning that as Ar­
abs, they support Hussein, but 
as inhabitants of an occupied 
territory, they do sympathize 
with the people of Kuwait.
• Tsemel also discussed the 
conditions under which Pal­
estinians in the occupied ter­
ritories are living. She de­
scribed the extensive efforts 
-of the Israelis to control the 
¦people and prevent any lead­
ership or development in these 
areas.
' Tsemel described a prison 
camp where thousands of ad­
ministrative detainees have 
been held for reasons undis­
closed to them. These detain­
ees include teachers, lawyers, 
workers, and “any person who 
might be said to have some 
land of effect on others,” ac­
cording to Tsemel. This is a 
way, she said, to “cut people 
from any possible leadership” 
'or any attempts at indepen­
dence.
Another way to control the 
people, said Tsemel, is through 
collective punishment such as 
curfews. The Israeli army also 
demolishes houses of Pales­
tinian offenders for reasons 
which are “becoming smaller 
and smaller,” said Tsemel.
Tsemel discussed the in­
creasing difficulty of defend­
ing Palestinians against pun­
ishment for reasons which are 
labeled “secret” by Israeli offi­
cials. Although she continues 
to try, the system is becoming 
so “grotesque,” said Tsemel, 
that “any argument that I 
would bring would be rejected 
by another argument that only 
presents how bad the situation 
really is.”
Tsemel discussed other con­
cerns such as torture methods 
used by Israelis during inter­
rogation and the growing 
number of fanatics on both 
sides of the conflict. She also 
stressed the importance of the 
people of the U.S. getting in­
volved in their government’s 
role in Israel.
Tsemel exemplified the 
magnitude of American influ­
ence in Israel with the situa­
tion of the deportation of Pal­
estinians. After continuous 
efforts of Israeli lawyers and 
officials to try and stop depor­
tations, it took “one phrase 
from the White House” to stop 
it, according to Tsemel. “We 
need you to produce more and 
more phrases of the same 
kind,” she said.
While Tsemel’s main con­
cern and struggle is for Pales­
tinian human rights, she also 
commented on the recent cri­
sis in Kuwait.
“I am against occupation 
and I am against Arab reac­
tion to Hussein,” said Tsemel. 
She believed that both Iraq 
and the U.S. should withdraw 
and find out what kind of re- 
| gime the Kuwaitis want, just 
; as Israeli forces should with- 
| draw from the occupied Pales- 
; tinian territories.
I “I cannot finish this speech 
¡in any kind of optimism.... 
There is a fear of a very seri­
ous clash to come,” said 
iTsemel.
Rao regroups advisory committee
PSAC, from page 1
from the fact that the old council “was too 
big. It was very difficult to get a decision.” 
Under the previous system, PSAC was 
composed of representatives from large 
campus organizations, usually the organi­
zation presidents. The new PSAC will con­
sist of only ten members, who, according to 
Rao, will be “a more potent group of student 
leaders working together.”
A student can be nominated for a seat on 
PSAC by the “chief executive officer of any 
recognized student organization or by a 
Senator from the student’s college,” ac­
cording to Rao. After the nominations are 
in, applications will be reviewed by Rao
"It's definitely a step forward for us.”
— Conrad Zapanta, 
A Phi 0 president
and Michael Murphy, dean of student af­
fairs, based on several criteria. Anominee’s 
ability to represent a large number of 
constituencies, as well as the student body 
as a whole, will be an important factor in 
the selections. The final list of members is 
subject to Mehrabian’s approval.
“I’m very excited,” said Rao. “I’m very 
results-oriented, and in the new struc­
ture, this group will become more results- 
oriented.”
“This is a good move,” said Student 
Senate Chair Chris Neighbor. “Ifyou think 
of PSAC as a group to talk to the President 
and air concerns, then smaller is better. If 
you want a group to work and get things 
done, then you need a decent number of 
people. I think that [Rao] has found a good
medium between the two.”
“I think [Rao’s] plan is good,” said Alpha 
Phi Omega president Conrad Zapanta. Tin 
not upset about losing [A Phi O’s] seat on 
PSAC, because [Rao] is the kind of person 
who will still listen to a group.
“The PSAC never got a lot done before,” 
Zapanta added. “There were too many 
people to agree on issues that weren’t really 
big. This way, with nominees holding the 
seats, the people on PSAC will want to work 
with the campus and the President to ac­
complish things. It’s definitely a step for­
ward for us.”
Nominations from organization CEOs are 
due by noon Thursday._______________
Award monies rise
AWARD, from page 1
cisions were made after much de­
liberation.
The money for the awards comes 
mostly from donations from Car­
negie Mellon alumni. Each year, 
the money is invested, and then 
the number of awards is figured 
against the amount of money. In 
order to renew the scholarship 
each year, students must main­
tain a specific QPA and show in­
volvement in the campus commu­
nity. The group meets regularly 
and is beginning several projects 
to help improve campus spirit.
“This year, [the committee is] 
not getting any more money, but 
they are going to offer less schol­
arships,” said Krause.
“I don’t think that there is any 
malice involved in the decision. 
It’s not less than ethical, and le­
gally, it is sound,” said Keating. 
“No one is getting less than they 
were promised originally, as long 
as they keep to the standards of 
the program.”
“They told us we were going to 
get $3,000 a year, and that is 
what we’re getting,” Krause 
agreed.
Keating also said that he un­
derstood why some of the par­
ticipants are bothered with the 
change. “I encourage the students 
to talk to [Associate Vice Presi­
dent for Financial Resources] 
Walter Cathie. The decision is 
made based on the funding avail-
able,” he said.
Part of the philosophy behind 
the award is to make students 
feel better about Carnegie Mellon 
both while they are here and after 
they graduate.
That philosophy worked the 
first year, “but now that students 
feel that they’ve been cheated, it 
could work the other way,” said 
Krause. “My group [the sopho­
mores] was the first group to ap­
ply for the award, and we’re the 
‘leaders’ of the group. We’re set­
ting the direction,” said Krause. 
“When we’ve done all of the work 
and the planning this year, and 
the next year’s group gets more 
money, what are we supposed to 
think?”

FORUM
IMs thrive for good reason
Students, faculty, and staff are 
taking part in Carnegie Mellon’s 
intramural athletics program in 
record numbers, and there are a 
lot of good reasons. Fitness, com­
petition, and fun are chief among 
those promoted by the athletic 
department; however, the single 
most important — and most often 
overlooked — reason is the pro-
* gram itself.
Carnegie Mellon’s IM program 
is a rare breed among the nation’s 
universities because students play 
an integral part in running the 
show.
Student leadership in intramu­
ral programs is tough to find, and 
effective student management is 
rarer still. However, the CMU 
program is seen nationwide as a 
model of how an intramural pro­
gram should be run, according to 
the Athletic Department.
It all starts with attitude. All 
the members of the IM program, 
Trom director Earl Birdy on down, 
believe wholeheartedly in their 
¦obligation to the campus commu­
nity. That attitude carries over 
into the final product.
Besides, the system really works. 
Students have control over what 
happens while the IM office acts 
more as a facilitating agent than 
as a controlling body. The result­
ing delegation of power allows for 
an infusion of creativity and en­
thusiasm that might not otherwise 
he possible.
The Athletic Department 
shouldn’t be overlooked when
giving out credit. It has done a 
great job of giving the program 
the proper level of support. Facili­
ties and equipment have always 
been available to the program, 
allowing the IM department to 
offer a truly amazing variety of 
sports (40 in all) to the campus 
community. Without such sup­
port, the intramural program 
would barely be able to survive, 
much less grow as it has in recent 
years.
However, the system doesn’t 
mean a thing unless it has the 
support of the people who par­
ticipate, and the campus commu­
nity has responded to our IM pro­
gram exceptionally. Last year, 18 
intramural sports set new records 
for team and individual partici­
pation (many set records in both 
categories), and two of those have 
already fallen in the last three 
weeks. That sort of enthusiasm 
should be commended, especially 
at a university like Carnegie 
Mellon where free time is hard to 
come by.
We ask those who have ignored 
Carnegie Mellon’s IM program to 
take another look. The time com­
mitment involved is only what 
you choose to put into it, and the 
variety of activities available 
guarantees that there’s something 
for everyone.
Our intramural athletic pro­
gram is a golden opportunity that 
every member of the campus 
should try to take advantage of. 
It’s well worth it.
Rebirth improves PSAC
Dealing with the bureaucracy of 
Warner Hall can be one of the 
most frustrating things about go­
ing to school at Carnegie Mellon. 
There seems to be a never-ending 
string of forms, people, and places 
to deal with, and an ever-mount­
ing level of aggravation and stress.
However, there do exist organi­
zations designed to help students 
navigate through Warner Hall, 
organizations that get student 
voices heard in the upper levels of 
the administration. One of these 
organizations is PSAC, the 
President's Student Advisory 
Council. PSAC meets each month 
wtfth the president of the Univer­
sity, as a forum to air student 
concerns and ideas.
•Unfortunately, PSAC has been 
seen as unrepresentative in the 
past. Because it consisted only of 
chief executive officers from stu­
dent organizations, with no elected 
members, it presented an 
Unrepresentative sample of the 
student body.
' -Two years ago, Nicole Austin, 
then the president of Spirit, said 
that there was an “old boys net­
work” at work among PSAC, a 
sense of informality that under­
mined the effectiveness of the 
group — and we think she was 
right.
That may be remedied this year, 
thanks to the initiative of Student 
Government President Kishore 
Rao, who is changing PSAC for 
the better.
The new PSAC should to present 
a more representative face to 
President Mehrabian. From 
nominations provided by the 
heads of student organizations 
and student senators, Rao and 
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy will select 10 committee
Stereotyping of Greeks is not productive
mENNER Ns 
NHE xbaNsR
Editor:
Recent letters to the 
editor prompt us to 
write a few words in 
defense of our Greek 
system and, particu­
larly, our fraternity members.
Fraternities suffer from an “animal 
house” stereotype that belies their cen­
tral strengths of character and brother­
hood. This stereotype is unfortunately 
brought in by some younger and less 
mature members of the houses offering 
enough incidents to allow those so in­
clined to believe that misconduct is en­
demic to the system. That a few of the
over 1,000 fraternity members on the 
campus occasionally act in an immature 
manner should not be tolerated. It should 
also not be exaggerated.
Greek organization members are in­
volved in student government, residence 
life, freshman orientation, the women’s 
center, and virtually every student or­
ganization. The fraternities provide much 
of the social life, intramural activity, and 
community service on this campus. Greek 
officers and members work hard to ac­
centuate the true meaning of brotherhood 
and sisterhood and to enhance the cam­
pus community generally.
We do not believe that the Greek sys­
tem is without problems, nor do we kno\y 
of any Greek member who believes sol 
We do believe that Greek affiliation is a 
meaningful part of the lives of many of 
our students, faculty, and staff. We hope 
we can all work together constructively 
to make the Greek system oh the 
Carnegie Mellon campus as strong and 
productive as possible.
Ronald J. Campana
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
and Greek Advisor
Michael C. Murphy 
Dean of Student Affairs
Fraternity members play hard and work hard
members. They will then confer 
with student organization lead­
ers before presenting their final 
list to President Mehrabian. Once 
seated, the regular members of 
PSAC will be able to invite any 
student to the meeting to talk 
with President Mehrabian face to 
face.
Nomination is easy. A student 
needs only to be recommended by 
the CEO of a student organization 
or by a senator from his or her 
home college. Each CEO or sena­
tor may nominate up to five people. 
Nominees will be selected on the 
basis of their ability to represent a 
broad number of constituency 
groups and the student population 
at large.
The new PSAC is a good idea. 
Carnegie Mellon is here for one 
purpose above all others: to dis­
seminate knowledge. An organi­
zation like PSAC makes it possible 
for students to talk directly to the 
administrators who make the 
decisions that will affect the 
quality and type of education of­
fered at the University. By doing 
this, PSAC helps eliminate any 
barriers that may exist between 
students and faculty, between the 
educational and administrative 
world.
For this organization to work 
well, it needs to be representative 
of the student body as a whole, not 
merely a club for student organi­
zation presidents. For PSAC to be 
effective, it needs to give everyone 
equal access to its ranks, to give 
everybody the same access to 
President Mehrabian.
We applaud Rao’s effort and 
initiative. PSAC is a useful arm of 
student government, one that 
might prove invaluable in the fu­
ture.

Fraternities. We’ve 
all seen Animal House, 
with its portrayal of the mENNER Ns 
“typical” fraternities, the Editor 
Guys guzzling beer and 
Jack Daniels, leaving dead horses in the 
dean’s office. However, besides the fact 
that this was an exaggerated account of 
fraternity houses, fraternities have also 
changed quite a bit since then. Unfortu­
nately, the public’s distorted views of 
them have not.
Some numbers were quoted in last 
week’s Tartan, in an article by Greg 
Wilson [“Fraternities exploit fun and 
games,” 9/24], It was said that four out of 
seven Crime and Incident reports were
about fraternities. Some numbers that 
weren’t mentioned, however, are the fact 
that one third of the CMU campus is 
Greek, and another third are at the fra­
ternities on the weekends. With two 
thirds of the campus at the fraternities, 
it’s not out of the ordinary that barely 
half of the Crime and Incident reports 
are from the majority of the people.
Fraternities are an important part of 
the campus community. What would be 
left of Spring Carnival, Buggy, or Intra­
mural Sports without the fraternities? 
Last year, over $3,000 was raised for the 
charities by Greek Sing, and what of the 
thousands of dollars raised for charity by 
other Greek events, like Pi Lambda Phi’s 
Steel City Shootout, Theta Xi’s Basket
Bucks, and Delta Tau Delta’s Postman 
party. It would be a real shame to lose all 
of this because a few people are ignorant 
as to what fraternity life is really like.;
With the stress at CMU, I never would 
have made it through my freshman year 
without my brothers’ support. I’ve made 
friends that I’ll have for life, and who I 
am proud to know. Mr. Wilson, you know 
nothing about what you’re writing, and, 
for those of you who share Mr. Wilson’s 
view, I ask that you find out the truth 
about the fraternity life you’re condemn­
ing before you form an opinion about it!

Greg Wilson, in his 
letter to the editor last 
week [“Fraternities ex­
ploit fun and games,” 9/
24], tries to cast doubt 
on the Greek system at CMU by examin­
ing the Crime and Incident Report in the 
9/17 Tartan. However, he has neglected 
to check on his facts and assumptions.
Has he noticed that the Incident Re­
port takes up the exact same space every 
week? Could this possibly be due to se­
lective editing? Yes. I talkedto a member

whoever compiled it is against fraterni­

The questioning of the entire Greek 
system is absurd. There are twenty Greek 
organizations on campus (fourteen fra­
ternities, five sororities, and APhiO). We 
all know from reading the report that 
only two or three of them are trouble­
makers. Is that any reason to censure 
the other seventeen?
His mentioning of George Orwell is 
strikingly apt for that point — Big 
Brother would ban the Greek system, 
but no rational being would in a democ­
racy like America. The people that cause 
trouble and the fraternities they belong 
to are fined when they do wrong. A fra­
ternity was kicked off campus a couple of 
years ago for continuously breaking the 
rules. It can happen again. The ones that 
exist for brotherhood, however, should 
be allowed to prosper like any other

Editor: p CST
For a history major, ....
Allan Bourdius proves ------ --------
to be very ill-informed mENNER Ns 
about our Constitu- Editor
tion’s guarantees and 
assumptions. Mr. Bourdius’ column 
[“Learn to appreciate your freedoms 
now,” 9/17] begins by stating that the 
Constitutiongrarc/s U.S. citizens certain 
liberties and freedoms. To the contrary, 
the Constitution is actually predicated 
on the very idea that there are certain 
inalienable rights which can be neither 
granted to nor taken from the people 
because they simply exist in and of them­
selves.
Next Mr. Bourdius asks us to imagine 
living in a nation where certain unpleas­
ant conditions prevail, the first being a 
place where the police have “the right to
arbitrarily break up peaceful demon­
strations.” In fact, despite the First 
Amendment, which states “Congress 
shall make no law ... abridging ... the 
right of the people peaceably to as­
semble...,” police departments often 
break up even the most peaceable as­
semblies under state and local statutes 
regarding “disturbing the peace”, “failure 
to disperse”, “failure to obtain the nec­
essary permits”, (in some cities it is illegal 
for more than three people to meet 
without first obtaining a permit from the 
city) or “incitement to riot.”
On April 13th of this year, 150-200 
students at a national conference on 
racism held at Oberlin College held a 
march against bigotry. When they arrived 
outside the college’s president’s house, 
they were met by security officers and 
police. Three students were allowed to
make speeches •— the fourth was at­
tacked by three police officers and placed; 
in a chokehold, and when students ap-! 
proached to protest his treatment, they 
were arrested on charges including as-; 
saulting a police officer, resisting arrest,. 
obstructing official business, failure toi 
disperse, attempted theft, and inciting; 
to violence. Several were knocked to the; 
ground, kicked, beaten with flashlights, 
and harassed by K-9 units. Now, who 
has the freedom?
Next we are exhorted to imagine a! 
place where people are denied decent 
health care and education. “In many 
Third World nations,” Bourdius states, 
“the government does just that.” In this 
nation, Mr. Bourdius, the government; 
does just that. The Constitution never: 
mentionshealth care or decent education1

ous challenge — avoid 
smoking completely from to­

The purpose of Non-Smok­
ing Week is to recognize that 
smoking kills you and other 
people around you, and as 
such, it bars peace and har­
mony in a society.
Let us show the world that 
we at Carnegie Mellon

to be the combined effort of 
everyone here. Let us join 
together and show our spirit! 
This is a great opportunity 
for us to join together with 
one simple objective in mind. 
The impact of a group of 
people on the world is as 
strong as their spirit, not 
their size! The enthusiasm 
you show for this will pro­
mote world peace in every 
country in the world if you do 
your bit for it.

of music majors. They practiced 
much more rigorously, and the 
band was admittedly much better 
than it is now. In fact, the Kiltie 
Band put on 52 public perfor­
mances in 1935, including regu­
lar appearances with Marshall 
Bidwell at Carnegie Music Hall. 
Granted, the Kiltie Band of today 
is not of that caliber, but, consid­
ering that it is composed prima­
rily of non-music majors, and 
that it rehearses twice a week for 
two hours, it is unreasonable to 
try to compare it to the Kiltie 
Band of 1935.
Perhaps Mr. Savitz was trying 
to compare the Kiltie Band now to 
what it has been in the past few 
years. To that, let me point out 
that I have been a member of the 
Kiltie Band for over six years. 
Arguably, my experience with 
the band has been much shorter 
than Mr. Savitz’s, but I feel I can 
speak with the authority of 
someone who has been quite close 
to the band, at least for the past
six years.
It is with this authority that I 
say that the band has gotten off 
to at least as good a start this 
year, as it has in any other recent 
year. This year, a large number of 
freshmen joined the band, and 
thus, the band has started off this 
year much bigger than in previ­
ous years. The balance, too, is 
much better this year, because 
there are approximately equal 
numbers in each of the major 
musical sections.
Another thing to consider is the 
number of rehearsals held before 
the first game. This year, with the 
first game being on September 
15, there were only five rehears­
als available to rehearse both the 
music and the formations of a 
halftime show. On one of these 
rehearsal dates, it rained, thus 
making it impossible to rehearse 
the marching part of the show, 
and leaving a total of only four 
rehearsals to get organized and 
put together an entire show. Tak­
ing this lack of available rehearsal 
time into account, I think the 
Kiltie Band did a commendable 
job in learning the music and put­
ting together a show.
Further, I take strong excep­
tion to the manner in which Mr. 
Savitz chose to voice his criticism. 
What kind of “scouting report” 
was it? To whom was it directed, 
opposing teams and their bands? 
Who asked for his “scouting re­
port,” and on what authority does 
it come?
I would like to point out that the 
Kiltie Band is a service organiza­
tion. It exists to serve others. It 
has to try to please not only the 
alumni and current students, but 
also the other fans, the cheerlead­
ers, the football players them­
selves, the coaches and other 
people in the Athletic Depart­
ment, the Carnegie Mellon Uni­
versity Administration, and the 
band members. It isn’t possible to 
please everyone all the time. It 
simply isn’t. However, it does put
forth a great effort to please as 
many people as it can.
The band director and officers 
always welcome constructive 
criticism. Suggestions that might 
make the music or shows better 
are welcomed, and all are seri­
ously considered. However, Mr. 
Savitz chose to use destructive 
criticism in that he didn’t offer 
any suggestions for improvement 
or provide any explanation for his 
opinion.
Certainly Mr. Savitz is entitled 
to his opinion, but he shouldn’t 
make it public unless he either 
substantiates it, or phrases it in 
such a way that improvement can 
be made.
Mr. Savitz must have made his 
comment with malicious intent, 
for only harm can come from his 
remarks. As the president of the 
Kiltie Band, it is very frustrating 
for me, because I personally spent 
a great deal of time and effort this 
summer recruiting the incoming

Neglect of High Holy Days cannot be tolerated
Qs:Editor:
This year, 
apparently for
the first time in mENNER Ns 
the 15 years I the Editor 
have been a
chaplain at CMU, an unparal­
leled number of critical events 
were scheduled, however inad­
vertently, to coincide with the 
most sacred and solemn High Holy 
Day of Yom Kippur, the Jewish 
Day of Atonement.
Since the Day of Atonement is 
the most sacred occurrence in the 
Jewish year, I must confess as­
tonishment that in our CMU plu-
ralistic community the rights and 
needs of the Jewish students and 
the special sensitivities of the 
High Holy Days, generally re­
spected in the past, have this year 
been neglected, if not abused.
This raises a question of utmost 
significance about the philosophy 
of the University. No matter how 
distinguished we may be as a 
scholastic institution, our stat­
ure cannot possibly be retained or 
enhanced if we do not empower 
students of diverse faiths who so 
wish to come to a university where 
they may celebrate their spiri­
tual identity.
It is a generally accepted prin­
ciple in American culture and on 
campuses everywhere that the 
entire enterprise of a university 
is sensitive to the fact that stu­
dents can be given this opportu­
nity to search for the values em­
bodied in their tradition only if 
their most sacred times and sea­
sons are respected.
I am referring to the fact that it 
has been brought to my attention 
that there have been a number of 
“collisions” with Rosh Hashana 
and Yom Kippur not isolated to 
the IFC events but reaching into 
academic departments as well. I
have always trusted that reserve 
of good will and mutual respect 
which has been central to CMU’s 
culture and hope that every pos­
sible step will be taken to correct 
this situation in the future. This 
is because we speak of spiritual 
development alongside the pur­
suit of academic excellence con­
stantly here, and I can only hope 
that the values that we espouse 
will be restored.

Michael G’s Pizzeria does not deliver its promises
Editor: “
Sometime 
last week, we 
found a yellow 
advertisement 
for Michael G’s
Pizzeria and Pub. It had decent 
prices and some food that we liked, 
so we picked it up. A couple of 
days later, we decided to order
mENNER Ns 
NHE xbaNsR
some buffalo wings from Michael 
G’s. The menu stated that each 
order was part of a $2.95 platter 
that included french fries. We 
called and found out that the or­
der consists of five whole wings 
(like you get at G’s on Melwood 
St.). What we got were very small 
wings, and they were not even 
buffalo wings. They were fried
chicken wings. We also did not 
get any fries, and the driver was 
convinced that none were sup­
posed to come with them, even 
though french fries included 
screams out from the menu. To 
top it off, the cans of coke we 
ordered were dirty and one had a 
half dead roach stuck to the side 
ofit. No joke. Take our advice and
order elsewhere.

— nor does the government con­
sistently provide either.
One-fourth of the homeless in 
the United States are children. 
One-fourth of all people suffering 
from poverty in the United States 
are children. Millions of Ameri­
cans go without health insurance 
because they cannot afford it.
In May of this year the Special 
Supplemental Food Program for 
Women, Infants, and Children 
(WIC) — which currently only 
serves half the people eligible — 
suffered further deep budget cuts. 
Among the effects was the termi­
nation of benefits for 14,000 chil­
dren in Missouri — because they 
do not show signs of clinical 
malnutrition despite the fact that 
they are underfed. The director of 
the Missouri Health Department 
has said that those children would 
probably qualify for benefits in 
the next few months — after they 
show signs of anemia or malnu­
trition.
As for education, because of the 
local tax-based funding structure 
of our school systems, schools in 
poor neighborhoods receive, on 
average, half the funding of those 
in wealthy areas. In my home 
state of Oregon, most schools are 
funded by yearly property tax ini­
tiatives. Oftentimes, voters do not 
pass the initiative, apparently 
preferring low tax rates to educa­
tion, and whole school districts 
are threatened with closure. One 
year students from a town 30 miles 
away were bussed to my school 
district (causing immense crowd7 
ing) because their schools had 
been shut down for lack of funds. 
Now who seems to want “as many 
unhealthy and illiterate citizens 
as possible?”
It is a myth that we in the United 
States enjoy unlimited freedom 
and opportunity. It is both naive 
and dangerous to continue to be­
lieve this myth. Although Mr.
Bourdius’ column was ill-founded 
and factually incorrect, there is 
one thing he is right about—that 
it is irresponsible for us to delude 
ourselves into believing that our 
freedoms cannot be taken away. 
In fact, they are constantly, sub­
tly being eroded to the benefit of 
those in power. Now is the time 
when we must begin to take the 
fullest advantage of our freedoms 
in order both to ensure their con­
tinuance, and to repair the ineq­
uities and prejudices still inher­
ent in our system.

Let’s say a prayer for our friends out there
Jonathan G. Levy
I had a strange dream Friday 
night. Like most dreams, the de­
tails — which seemed perfectly 
natural at the time — are now 
either clearly full of logical holes 
or forgotten.
The basic plot, though, was all 
too real and all too memorable.
I had somehow become a mem­
ber of the U.S. military and was 
flown, along with my unit, to Saudi 
Arabia. I don’t remember what 
we did while we were there. I 
don’t remember whether I felt 
exceptionally hot. I don’t remem­
ber noticing any of the things that 
the newspapers and magazines 
say are so notable about Saudi 
Arabia.
What I do remember is that I 
was very scared that I was going 
to die at any moment.
After about 45 minutes in Saudi 
Arabia, I was rotated back to the 
United States and the dream 
ended.
As I said above, many parts of 
my dream — such as the fact that 
I was flown half way around the 
world to stay for only 45 minutes
— are totally unrealistic. But, I 
think there was at least one part 
of the dream that may have been 
very realistic—the fear I felt that 
I was about to die.
I would not be surprised if many 
of the United States troops in 
Saudi Arabia felt that way right 
now. In fact, I would be surprised 
if they did not feel that way be­
cause I would be surprised if I did 
not feel that way in the same 
situation.
The United States servicemen 
and servicewomen in the Middle 
East right now are not that much 
different from the students on 
this campus. Many of them are 
our ages. They are the people who 
went with us to high school, our 
little league teammates, the kids 
who we played with on the play­
ground.
Perhaps this is not literally 
true. As usually happens, the 
people serving in the military are 
probably poorer and more likely 
to be minorities than the students 
at an expensive private univer­
sity such as CMU. But basically, 
they are the same as the rest of 
us.
And they have every reason to 
be scared.
It is possible that there will 
never be a shot fired during the 
Iraqi crisis. But then it is also
“The United States servicemen and 
servicewomen in the Middle East 
right now are not that much different 
from the students on this campus. 
Many of them are our ages. They are 
the people who went with us to high 
school, our little league teammates, ; 
the kids who we played with on the 
playground."
possible that before we sit down 
to take our finals this semester, 
war will break out and thousands 
of those kids we grew up with will 
die.
I am not trying to say that we 
should not have troops in the 
Middle East or that we should be 
overly hesitant to use them. There 
are times when just wars have to 
be fought and maybe this is one of 
them.
I am only trying to give my 
guess as to what may be going 
through the heads of people who 
were children with us but who, 
through whatever twist of fate, 
may not get the chance to be old
with us.
These young people should 
scared, and we should be scar« 
for them. A great tragedy may b( 
about to strike our generation',^ 
it has struck many generation 
before us.
We may not be able to stop it'In 
the greater scheme of things',..\y< 
might be better off not stoppinj 
it.
But we should at least 
coming and if it happens we 
realize what we have lost.

Government needs to be a friend in order to succeed
“Is it just me, or is Russia changing 
these days’?” — Javi
Tests, stress, personal problems, no 
sleep — not the best mindset for a seri­
ous view of how our government has 
operated during the past 45 years, but, 
hey, it must be done.
On Wednesday, East and West become 
Germany, and the cold war, ever 
threatening as a source of national and 
governmental attention, becomes moot. 
With one Germany, the tension level in 
western Europe decreases markedly — 
unless you’re French, of Polish, or Rus­
sian ... The threat of superpower con­
frontation goes out the window, along 
with many a nuclear scenario.
Hell, with the changes in Russia lately, 
it would seem that the world is a safer 
place, and, in the absence of tension, it 
seems that it is. The level of inter-country 
communication — USSR and U.S., us 
vs. them — has risen. Kruschev’s mem­
oirs have been published, computers are 
going to Russia, and more information 
about the Cold War is coming available. 
And, thrown into sharper focus, is the 
fact that much of the paranoia and fear
Don Pickett
was manufactured.
The Cold War, it seems increasingly, 
was a largely “fictional” artifice. Not 
fictional in the sense of being at its base 
false, but fictional in the sense that many 
of the things that constituted the rea­
sons for the Cold War — a Soviet 
masterplan for world domination, ever- 
creeping Soviet aggression — were in 
fact absent.
What makes this interesting for people 
other than hardcore historians and po­
litical freaks is the mindset the govern­
ment acquired during the Cold War. For 
the past 45 years, the American gov­
ernment has operated with the mindset 
that somewhere out there is an enemy, 
someone out to get us, someone against 
whom we must fight to preserve our 
freedom. That mindset fostered the
Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, 
containment, and every other decision 
that was based on the assumption that 
the United States was indeed in grave 
danger.
But now, with the enemy removed, 
and those assumptions thrown into a 
doubtful light, the government is in a bit 
of a spot. Without an enemy, the United 
States government has no focus for its 
energies, for its aggressions, or for all the 
people it employs—all trained and orga­
nized to respond to a large, clear threat, 
an “evil” threat.
So now the government must thrash 
around, looking for something against 
which to fight. The latest enemy is the 
war on drugs, a great, evil, nebulous 
threat to everything American, great, 
and free. The war on drugs has become 
the Great Evil, and all the powers of the 
country have been mobilized against it
— laws, the military, propaganda. It is 
the usual thing — something is defined 
as the enemy, and the government mo­
bilizes all its power against it, to the 
extent that there is no other option, and 
nothing else will be considered.
The government, at least as it is con­
figured now, will never consider legaliz­
ing drugs. Human beings have been 
messing themselves up as long as there 
have been drugs—telling people to Just 
Say No doesn’t work, nor does squashing 
first and fourth amendment rights in a 
blind, headlong rush to fight an enemy 
that might not even been there in the 
first place, an enemy that is invented 
merely because someone, somewhere 
needs an enemy.
A government set up in such a way is 
dangerous — when one enemy disap­
pears, another must be found, or the 
government will lose its focus and be 
unable to make a decision. A govern­
ment that needs an enemy to justify its 
existence has lost sight of its goals — by 
the people, of the people, and for lthe 
people. Government is not a police force. 
Government should be a friend, not a 
kindergarten teacher.

tween a CMU 
student and a LaRouche supporter' 
that came to blows and was broken

Editor’s note: The Crime and In­

afternoon. Although the LaRouche 
incident you’ve mentioned occurred' 
on the Friday before our last issue, 
The Tartan did not receive the po­
lice report until this week. We have 
included the incident on page 4.
Kiltie Band’s performance during 
Gesling dedication was commendable
BAND, from page 7
freshmen, and I felt that it had 
succeeded, since the band had 
such a high freshman turnout. 
Mr. Savitz’s remark is especially 
biting to me, as I have so much 
time invested in the Kiltie Band 
itself. His remark is also discour­
aging to all the other band mem­
bers, who worked so hard to put 
together the best show we could 
for the opening of Gesling Sta­
dium.
Being in the band is often a 
thankless job, and band members 
certainly don’t need people like 
Mr. Savitz telling them that 
they’re “sick.” If anything, Mr. 
Savitz’s remark has discouraged 
current band members and scared 
away any potential band mem­
bers, thus hurting the band even 
more.
Very rarely do I get any positive
feedback about the Kiltie Band’s 
performance. I’m sure that, espe­
cially at this time, any band 
member would appreciate a com­
pliment.
At the very least, if criticism is 
necessary, please let it be con­
structive.

America is in a crisis period. It is a 
crisis that has sweeping ramifications 
on America’s economic health and pros- 
erity. No, it’s not the oil “shortage” from 
he Iraq standoff in the Middle East. It’s 
the federal budget crisis. In short, the 
)vemment is bankrupt. People’s jobs 
aje threatened. Mass furloughs of civil 
servants are putting government on the 
brink of no man’s land.
According to USA Today last Thurs­
day, the government is facing a crisis 
that would almost shut down govern­
ment service. In the agricultural indus­
try, 7,500 meat and poultry inspectors 
will be furloughed for four days in the 
¦st two weeks of October. The FAA 
(Federal Aviation Administration) plans
to furlough its 50,000 employees, includ­
ing air traffic controllers and safety in­
spectors one day a week. Almost every 
single governmental department is 
feeling the budget pinch ranging from 
the Treasury Department to Health and 
Human Services. The government has 
no money left to pay its employees and so 
in the next few weeks, government ser­
vice will be spotty and staff will be 
trimmed to save money.
This is a pathetic state. It’s even more 
pathetic that neither Congress nor 
President Bush recognizes the conse­
quences of their refusal to do the intel­
ligent thing. That is to stop taking cheap 
political shots at each other and to begin 
working together to resolve this dis-

crepancy. This mismanagement of gov­
ernment is going to prove extremely 
embarrassing eventually for Bush and 
the Republican party. Voters are going 
to be impatient (if not already) with the 
incompetence of government and its of­
ficials. It is very apparent that beginning 
with the Reagan years, government mis­
management has become the norm. It 
will be enjoyable to see the high and
mighty conservatives take a fall that all 
the Republican men can not put back 
together.
If Americans can’t realize that taxes 
are needed, then it’s up to the govern­
ment to do the right thing. Granted that 
taxes are unpopular and one of the causes 
of re-election failures, it should not excuse 
politicians from saying that taxes are 
needed. To use a crude analogy, deficit 
spending is like buying on your credit 
card and paying off the minimum twenty 
dollars each month and in the process 
accumulating a huge debt. With the 
strain on the economy coming from fi­
nancial market instability due to the oil 
shock and from the astronomical costs of 
supporting U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia,
the illusion of a stable economy has fi­
nally shattered. It’s none too soon either. 
There are serious policy and structural 
flaws with the system. For a decade, 
there has been a bankrupting economic 
policy of promoting spending and more 
spending.
It’s ironic to note how the Republican 
Party has labeled the Democratic Party 
as the tax and spend party. Hopefully, 
Bush and Congress will mature and re­
alize that the future of American lives 
depend on the recognition that present 
economic policy is a sham and desperately 
needs to be revised.

The drug war is almost over, but no one’s doing anything
, America has won the drug v/ar! Well, 
maybe not quite yet, but some telltale 
-signs of progress have surfaced lately. 
Americans cannot claim victory against 
this terrible scourge until we as a nation 
take all necessary steps to solving this 
complex problem.
But first, some good news. Drug czar 
iWilliam Bennett has come forth with 
some surprising information. Since we 
finally started getting tough with drug 
dealers and began coordinating anti-drug 
efforts with South America, the amount 
gf.drugs cominginto the U.S. has steadily 
declined when coupled with interdiction 
measures. A clear message sent to the 
pushers and the growers that the U.S. is 
serious has finally begun to reap some 
benefits.
In other encouraging events, overall 
drug consumption has seemingly peaked, 
as reported by Bennett, which gives heart 
to the drug war. This plateau may signal
¡retreat of drug consumption nation-
\J tu\y * T. S. Blass
wide. With drugs commanding higher 
prices because of the lower supply, 
Americans have sobered up to the fact 
that the time has come to kick the habit.
The policy question of how to deal with 
a growing population of former addicts 
becomes more and more pressing. 
Lawrence Lewin, who recently chaired 
an Institute of Medicine committee on 
the subject, says, “Treatment needs to be 
recognized as a more important compo­
nent [in the war on drugs].” Thousands 
of people who are trying to shake the 
deadly grip of drugs get placed on wait­
ing lists daily.
The state of affairs has become appall­
ing to this writer. I feel we must ban
together to help the unfortunate victims 
of drug addiction. There still remains 
staunch support of the interdiction-only 
option. No longer can we waste time 
bickering over the matter. People need 
help and support to beat their depen­
dency. When assistance by society is 
denied, these individuals feel abandoned 
by their government, leading to more 
drug abuse.
I feel that treatment provides the en­
during commitment to a solution for a 
problem which will not do with a quick 
fix as politicians would prefer. For this 
reason, we must encourage people to 
enter programs and support legislation 
to see more of these facilities built in 
order to cope with current and future 
reformists.
Some have questioned the need for 
treatment programs altogether. Depen­
dency isdefined as a condition wherein 
the afflicted “needs” the substance in 
question. Whether it is drugs or alcohol,
dependents face tough odds of going 
“cold turkey” to fight their desire to 
consume. Facilities treating this disease 
give self-confidence and self-reliance back 
to their patients. Once they overcome 
the necessity to shoot up, snort, or have 
a drink, the person can attack the reasons 
they began their dependency in the first 
place.
In the long run; America may appreci­
ate its foresight taken now so we can 
hopefully one day say goodbye to a dis­
turbing presence in American society, 
drugs. Let’s not forget the awesome dif­
ficulties these choices will cause for the 
time being, but the alternatives make 
me cringe.
History will tell the story. We can ei­
ther make the tough choices now, or 
experience the long enduring hardship 
of many decades to end this most hideous 
of social diseases.

“Krhese young guys need stuff. I 
mean, I don’t get that much mail, 
but some of these Marines get 
nothing... It’s just anything from 
thft States would mean a lot.” 
That quote is from USA Today’s 
“Letters Home” section. It was 
written by a U.S. Marine on duty 
in Saudi Arabia in a letter to his 
mother. Right now, there are 
thousands of American men and 
women participating in Opera­
tion Desert Shield — thousands 
of miles from home in a country 
with inhospitable surroundings 
and unfamiliar customs.
In no way am I saying that we 
should or shouldn’t go to war; 
that our military presence is jus­
tified or not; that Saddam Hussein 
ps the modem incarnation of Hitler 
or-just an Arab patriot; or that the 
crisis is a world issue or strictly 
an Arab one. We must not forget 
that all the soldiers, sailors, air­
men, and Marines “in country”

serving of our support — even if 
you think our military involve­
ment is incorrect.
One of the greatest tragedies of 
recent generations was how this 
nation forsook its Vietnam Veter­
ans. Vietnam was not a popular 
war in the eyes of the public and 
the public took out its rage on our 
returning veterans. Was this just? 
Was this fair? Wars are never 
made by the military (at least not 
in this country). To quote the 
Vietnam-era movie The Green 
Berets, “A soldier goes wherever 
he’s told to go and fight whomever 
he’s told to fight.” It was not an 
individual choice to go and fight 
in Vietnam, nor was it one when
the deployments to the Middle 
East began. The military was or­
dered to go, and it went.
We must not forget that the 
majority of U.S. servicemen and 
servicewomen currently in the 
Middle East are our generation. 
Most of them are between the 
ages of 18 and 23. They aren’t 
cold-blooded killers or blindly 
patriotic “flag-wavers;” they are 
terrified young Americans won­
dering if they will ever come home 
or not. None of them want to die 
or want to face that possibility. 
They’re not much different from 
you or me — they all want to be 
safe, free, and to live their lives as 
peacefully as possible. They are 
human beings with the basic 
emotional needs of feeling ac­
cepted and wanted.
I hope the campus population is 
concerned.enough to write to our 
fellow young Americans. Give 
them a hand to hold, a shoulder to 
cry on, and a friend back home to
talk to. Give an American the 
assurance that his country will 
not forsake him and that we ap­
preciate his dedication to his ser­
vice.
Whether or not you’re in favor 
of our presence in Saudi Arabia, 
don’t forget the men and women 
of our Armed Forces. All it takes 
is a 25-cent stamp and ten min­
utes of your time to let an Ameri­
can know that you are concerned 
for their safety and that we won’t 
let them down. For this small 
price, you can make the day of 
any soldier, sailor, airman, or 
Marine.

Soccer climbs up
in UAA standings
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The CMU soccer team took a 
big leap forward in the UAA yes­
terday by beating Brandeis Uni­
versity, 1-0. The victory evened 
the Tartans’ UAA record at 2-2 
and gave them a 6-2 overall mark.
The first half was marked by 
solid defense that produced a
scoreless deadlock. Both teams 
held each other’s scoring oppor­
tunities to a minimum, and shut 
them down when occasional 
chances arose. The Judges’ best 
chance of the half came with nine 
minutes left Brandeis forward 
Michael Novaria drove down the 
right side and slipped into the 
goal area. However, freshman de-

Volleyball advances 
far in tournament
CMU edges Adrian with last minute field goal
"They were tough and aggressive and 
they were out to play. We knew from 
the get-go that we were in for a 
game."— senior Marvin Germany
By JUDY GROSSMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
After a 64 years since their last 
match-up, the CMU Tartans and 
the Adrian College Bulldogs meet 
again. The Tartans edged past 
the Bulldogs 24-23, before a crowd 
of 1200 at Maple Stadium in 
Adrian, Michigan.
The last time Carnegie Mellon 
and Adrian College met, Coke only 
came in bottles, William Gesling 
was in grade school, and Carnegie 
Mellon was still Carnegie Tech. 
The last time these two teams 
met, in 1926, the Tartans crushed 
the Bulldogs 47-0 on their way to 
a 7—2 season.
But that year, the Tartans also 
beat Pitt 14-0, West Virginia 20- 
0, and Notre Dame 19-0.
It was not as pretty as a win for 
the Tartans in 1990 as it was in 
1926. They gave up 265 yards 
passing and turned the ball over 
three times. They gave up a 39- 
yard touchdown pass with 2:18 to
play that gave Adrian a two-point 
lead. With eleven seconds re­
maining in regulation, senior 
kicker Joe Schwerha booted a 34- 
yard field goal to give the Tartans 
a one-point victory.
“A newspaper reporter from the 
Detroit Times wrote that because 
Adrian was playing Carnegie
Mellon, their quarterback should 
have so much time that he could 
sit back and drink a Coke,” said 
senior nose tackle Marvin Ger­
many. “We were very offended by 
that. We took it personally and it 
showed in the way we played.”
It was a hard-fought game. The 
Tartans simply fought harder, 
proving to one and all that they 
were “the Real Thing.” They re­
lied on their potent ground game, 
which gained 193 yards and scored 
three touchdowns against a tough 
Adrian defense. Halfback Scott 
Bamyak led the way with 96 
yards, leaving him just seven 
yards from becoming Carnegie 
Mellon’s all-time leading rusher.
And they relied on their de­
fense, which has a habit of mak­
ing big plays, to take the fizz out 
of Adrian’s offense. Key intercep­
tions by defensive back John 
Fratto and linebacker Matt 
Pielert late in the game, set up 
two Tartan touchdowns. Ablocked 
extra point after a 39-yard Bull­
dog touchdown proved to be the 
margin of victory, making 
Schwerha’s field goal game-win­
ning instead of just game-tying.
“It’s a good feeling when you 
know that even when your back’s 
up against the wall, one of the 
guys will make a big play,” said 
Germany.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
volleyball team hadits usual nail- 
biting match play at the 
Westminster Tournament on 
Saturday. The Tartans beat Thiel 
and Geneva in pool play and lost 
to St. Vincent in pool play and 
Westminster in the semi-finals.
Saturday morning the Tartans 
played Thiel in one of the longest 
matches of the day. In the first 
game the Tartans had an 11-6 
lead until Thiel evened the score 
to 14—14. Both teams had several 
opportunities to win but Carnegie 
Mellon held on for a 21—19 win.
The next game was controlled 
by Thiel, who owned a 49 lead 
over the Tartans in the onset of 
the match. Carnegie Mellon did 
make a comeback, bringing the
score to 7-9 but that was a far as 
the team got, as it lost 7-15.
The deciding game did not start 
of well for Carnegie Mellon, with 
a 0-7 deficit. After a timeout the 
Tartans stormed back to 6-7, and 
they finished off Thiel 15-13.
The nature of the seedings gave 
Carnegie Mellon the disadvan­
tage of playing back-to-back 
matches with Thiel and Geneva. 
The first two games were the usual 
tension-filled games the Tartans 
play, with CMU taking the first 
15-11 and Geneva the second 15- 
12. The final game was a difficult 
test for the Tartans because it 
was the sixth game in a row for 
them, but only the third for 
Geneva. Carnegie Mellon, how­
ever, overcame the fatigue factor 
and gained a 15-8 victory.
St. Vincent was the Tartans’

in Head of 
Ohio regatta
By WENDY EVANS
Special to The Tartan
The University Rowing Club kicked off its 
1990 fall season Saturday in its home town, 
medaling in five of the six events in 
Pittsburgh’s Head of the Ohio regatta.
In the first two events of the day, the 
men’s and women’s club eights had out­
standing races. Both teams placed second.
The men, second only to Villanova, beat 
11 boats, including the University of Ten­
nessee, Notre Dame, and Duquesne Univer­
sity, with a time of 12:39.89. The women 
crossed the finish lineatl4:06.79, surpassing 
Villanova and West Virginia University to 
the silver in their field of seven.
Carnegie Mellon crew coach Liz Winter 
was particularly pleased with the success to 
the eights. “It is gratifying to have such good 
results in the eights. It shows we’re making 
a good transition from fours to eights,” she 
said.
Two hours later, the women raced again, 
breaking up into fours to race the women’s 
club fours.
The heavyweight women again proved 
their ability to place second, beating 
Duquesne, the Indianapolis Rowing Club, 
Pitt, and the University of Tampa, with a 
time of 15:40.93.
The women’s lightweight team did not 
fare as well, finishing 11th in a strong 19- 
leam field. Villanova, Dowling, the Univer-

sity of Tennessee, Notre Dame, and the 
Western Reserve Rowing Association were 
among the competition.
A pair of Carnegie Mellon boats saw 
action for the men’s club fours; a men’s 
heavyweight team and a CMU rowing 
alumni boat participated in the 16-team 
field. The heavyweight team pulled down 
a silver medal with a time of 14:37.66
The men’s lightweight race featured 
intrasquad competition between two 
Carnegie Mellon boats. The B team edged 
the A team by five seconds, but was helped 
by the A team’s previous participation in 
the club eight race. The times of] 5:06.43
and 15:11.87 were good enough for 10th 
and 11th place, respectively.
In one of the last events of the day, the 
recreational singles, graduate student 
David Greene rowed his way to Carnegie 
Mellon’s first gold medal of the 
regatta.Greene won with a time of 15:51, 
even though a 30-second penalty was 
tacked on because he missed a buoy at 
the finish line.
Winter was pleased with the results. 
“We are achieving our goals,” she said. 
“There was a significant improvement 
over last year, and all crews have

fall season
By STEPHEN KANG
Tartan Saffwriter
As the fall season sports get into full gear, 
CMU lacrosse team is once again fine-tun- 
ing for the spring season ahead of time. 
CMU has already played two games this 
semester, both against its old nemesis, Pitt 
Panthers.
So far, the Panthers and CMU have split 
the series. CMU lost a 7-6 cliffhanger to 
Pitt in the first game, but came back to 
avenge the loss with an 11-4 win in the 
second game.
With two pre-season games, many rook­
ies have already seen a considerable amount 
of playing time. CMU took on 12 rookies 
this fall; among them is the freshmen at­
tack line of Dan Afrik and Adam Sarmarie. 
As forthe middie line, some ofthenewfaces 
include freshmen Brian Gager, Patrick 
Colburn, Rick Keiser, Christopher Culver, 
and Jody Schurman. In addition, freshman 
Damien Miller is filling in at the new back­
up goalie position.
Such a strong group of new players will 
help CMU go after the Pennsylvania League 
title in the spring, which it came close to 
winning the last season with a 6-4 record.
The team’s strength not only lies in the 
rookie players but also in the veteran tal­
ents. The 23 returning players should form 
a strong backbone of the team and carry on 
the team’s chemistry. The team’s edge in 
winning consistently in the spring depends

1990-91 NHL season opens Thursday; Edmonton should dominate
Tartans squeak by Adrian, 24-23
Men’s CC team blazes past Geneva College
By DAN HOLLAND
Tartan Staffwriter
Tragedy struck the CMU men’s 
cross country team this weekend 
as freshman Ryan Rasmussen 
collapsed at the top of the final 
loop on Flagstaff Hill. The un­
usually hot and humid weather 
was enough to dehydrate 
Rasmussen less than 200 meters 
; from the finish. He was taken to 
the hospital and was reported to 
be in good condition.
' Meanwhile, the Tartans won 
their 107th straight dual meet in 
typical fashion, beating Geneva 
College with a perfect score. Coach
Gary Mecldey wanted his runners 
to cruise to an easy victory but 
run the downhills hard.
Instead, senior Gary Harrison 
ran the whole race hard, finish­
ing in 26:33. Senior Tim Berger 
came in second with a time of 
26:52. Third was junior John 
Byrnes in 26:57, followed by se­
nior Dan Holland in 27:05.
In fifth place was sophomore 
Scott Phillips in 27:27. Close be­
hind came junior Russel Shorkey 
in 27:30 and freshman Jim Langer 
in 27:37. The first Geneva runner 
placed tenth overall.
Harrison felt that the pace was 
right on target. “I thought we
were going easy, especially up the 
three-mile hill,” he said. A pack of 
CMU runners stayed close for 
most of the race. But then 
Harrison broke it open at the top 
of Cobblestone Hill, right before 
the golf course.
Most of the post-race activities, 
however, were spent tending to 
Rasmussen. An ambulance was 
called to the scene to take him to 
the hospital. Coach Meckley and 
the women’s coach Dario 
Donatelli, a veteran runner him­
self, were extremely concerned. 
Meckley encourages his runners 
to hydrate with a lot of water 
before races to avoid such haz­
ards, whether it is hot or cold 
outside.
Rasmussen’s incident was just 
the latest pressure put on 
Meckley, who had had runners 
sick or injured throughout the 
season. However, the team is get­
ting healthy just in time for the 
big meets in late October and early 
November. Meckley wants to see 
his runners push the pace at the 
UAA Championships on October 
20, just three weeks away.
The Tartans’ greatest competi­
tion will come from Washington 
University in St. Louis, the Uni­
versity of Chicago, and Emory 
University.

Thursday evening brings the 
dawn of the 1990-91 NHL regular 
season. This season is sure to be 
an interesting one. Last year, the 
big story was the introduction of 
Soviet players into the league. 
This year, the Soviets may very 
well be swept into the background 
by the new wave of Czechoslova­
kian players.
This is also the last season of 
the 21-team league — expansion 
to 24 teams begins in 1991. Hockey 
salaries will probably be raised as 
a result of the new agreement 
that is being negotiated by the 
players and the owners. It’s no 
surprise that the Edmonton Oil­
ers are prime contenders to win 
the Stanley Cup, but if they do, 
they will become only the second 
team in NHL history to win six 
cups in eight seasons. Here’s a 
preview of'how the regular sea­
son division contests should come 
out and a close-up on the best 
team in each division:
Patrick Division. (New Jer­
sey Devils, New York Rangers, 
New York Islanders, Washington 
Capitals, Pittsburgh Penguins,
THE PUCK 
STOPS HERE
by Allan Bourdius
Philadelphia Flyers.)
The Devils definitely have what 
it takes to win the division. Their 
number one forward line will 
probably be Kirk Muller-Peter 
Stastny-John MacLean. If that 
line produces according to poten­
tial, Muller and Stastny could 
easilly break the 100-point barrier 
and MacLean could net 50 or more 
goals.
The Devils’ second and third 
lines should be powers to reckon 
with, too. Look for either Doug 
Brown or Walt Poddubny to play 
on the right side of Brendan 
Shanahan and Patrik Sundstrom. 
The Devils’ prime defensive line 
will probably be Claude Lemieux-
DavidMaley-Pat Conacher. Back 
on the blue line, the Devils’ de­
fense should top the division.
The pair of Soviets Viacheslav 
Fetisov and Alexi Kasatonov is 
easily the most experienced and 
talented pair in the division and 
perhaps in the league. They sim­
ply play magnificently together. 
The other standouts on the New 
Jersey defense are Bruce Driver, 
Ken Daneyko, and Eric Weinrich. 
In goal, the starter will most likely 
be Chris Terreri.
Adams Division. (Buffalo Sa­
bres, Boston Bruins, Montreal 
Canadiens, Hartford Whalers, 
Quebec Nordiques.)
The Sabres are going to simply 
be spectacular to watch this sea­
son. They have one heck of a one- 
two punch in Dale Hawerchuk 
and Pierre Turgeon.
There are lots of hopeful eyes in 
Buffalo looking for young Soviet 
defector Alexander Mogilny to 
reach his potential. Many feel that 
Mogilny will be the first true So­
viet NHL star because he’s by far 
the youngest at age 21. If those 
four players perform as expected,
Last year, the big story was the intro- 
duction of Soviet players into the 
league. This year,; the Soviets may
very well be swept 
ground by the new 
vakian players.
they should all wind up in the top 
twenty scorers.
The Sabres also have the de­
fense to match with Mike Ramsey 
and Doug Bodger in the top two 
slots. Goaltending should be 
stellar with both Darren Puppa 
and Clint Malarchuk on the team. 
Puppa should get the starting job 
after his 31 win season last year. 
Puppa’s goals against average was 
also one of the best at 2.89.
Norris Division. (St. Louis 
Blues, Chicago Blackhawks, 
Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red 
Wings, Minnesota North Stars)
The Blues are really going to be 
tough to beat this season. Brett 
Hull is unquestionably the team
into the back- 
wave of Czechoslo-
leader offensively. He’s not alone 
though. Expect Adam Oates and 
Geoff Courtnall to produce as well. 
St. Louis has very quietly built a 
very competitive team through 
both trades and bringing up young 
players. Second year player Rob 
Brind’Amour should have another 
exceptional season. Defense is 
solid with the addition of Scott 
Stevens and the return of Paul 
Cavalinni. St. Louis has strength 
in goal in Vincent Riendeau. 
Riendeau is far from alone in the 
net with the presence of promis­
ing rookie Curtis Joseph.
Smythe Division. (Edmonton 
Oilers, Los Angeles Kings, 
Calgary Flames, Winnipeg Jets,
Vancouver Canucks.)
First the Oilers had to play 
without Wayne Gretzky, now : 
they’re going to have to do it 
without Jarri Kurri. Kurri’s de­
parture is going to put even more 
pressure on Edmonton’s three 
other big names (Mark Messier, 
Esa Tikkanen, and GlenA 
Anderson) to produce.
After last season, it was clear 
that Messier had surpassed 
Gretzky as the dominant player 
on the ice. He could veiy well win 
back-to-back Hart Trophies', 
something only Gretzky has done 
in recent years. Defense is nb 
problem, especially not with Keviii 
Lowe, Randy Gregg, and Charliè 
Huddy on the team.
The success of Edmonton 
goaltenders can be directly at­
tributed to the incredible defense 
playing in front of them. Grant 
Fuhr’s drug-related suspension 
shoudn’t be a problem with thé 
outstanding Bill Ranford around.
Well, that’s the outlook for this 
season. The fun starts Thursday.

applied history major.

___________— senior Marvin Germany
FOOTBALL, from page 13
The Tartans struck first. Se­
nior quarterback Billy Snyder 
engineered an eight-play, 81-yard 
drive, keyed by an 18-yard pass to 
junior fullback Greg Marmol on 
third-and-eleven. The completion 
gave the Tartans first-and-10 at 
the Adrian 37. On the next play, 
Snyder hit Bamyak out of the 
backfield for a touchdown, and 
the Tartans led 7-0 with 11:43 to 
go in the first quarter.
Adrian came back with a score 
of their own, but it was for three- 
points instead of seven. The Bull­
dogs started on their own 42, and 
on third-and-seven, quarterback 
Pete Mazzoni hit split end Rich­
ard Benson for 46 yards and a 
first down at the Tartan nine- 
yard line. But the Tartan defense 
held, and on fourth-and-goal, 
Norman Potter booted a 23-yard 
field goal to put the Bulldogs on 
the scoreboard.
On Adrian’s next possession, 
which began with just over two 
minutes remaining in the first 
quarter, Mazzoni connected with 
fullback Robert Thompson for 60 
yards and a touchdown to put the 
Bulldogs on top, 10-7.
The Bulldogs regained posses­
sion less than a minute later as 
Stephan Pietzak picked off his 
second pass of the afternoon. The 
interception gave the Bulldogs 
good field position at the Tartan 
40-yard line.
Mazzoni, who finished the af­
ternoon an impressive 20 of 32 for 
265 yards, marched his team 
downfield forty yards in eight 
plays. The drive was keyed by a 
15-yard completion to Thompson 
on third and 13. Two plays later, 
Mazzoni hit Larry Anschuetz with 
a six yard touchdown pass to put 
the Bulldogs up 17-7.
The Tartans came back on their 
next possession with their second 
touchdown of the game. Follow­
ing Potter’s kickoff and Griffin 
Pero’s 19-yard return, the Tar­
tans took over on their own 49. 
Eight plays later, Snyder took the 
ball in from twenty yards out and 
the Tartans were back in the 
ballgame, 17-14.
Adrian was dealt a serious blow 
when Potter was injured midway 
through the second quarter. Pot­
ter went down after attempting 
to make a tackle on Pero’s kickoff 
return and was taken off the field 
on a stretcher. The loss of Potter 
might have cost the Bulldogs the 
ballgame.
The half ended with the score 
still 17—14. Neither team scored 
in the third quarter as both de­
fenses stiffened. The Tartans 
managed just 37 yards total of­
fense in the third; Adrian gained 
40 total yards. The closest either 
team got to scoring was when 
Adrian reached the Tartan 35.
Just minutes into the fourth 
quarter, Snyder was intercepted 
for the third time. Tim Valko 
picked off Snyder’s. pass at the 
Adrian 31 and Mazzoni and 
company took over.
The Bulldogs drove to the Tar­
tan 19, keyed by completions of 
nine and twelve yards to Benson. 
But freshman Paul Ivity, kicking 
for the injured Potter, missed a 
36-yard field goal and the Bulldog 
lead remained at three.
“That interception hurt us more 
than anyrthing,” said Snyder.
The Tartan defense put pres­
sure on Mazzoni as well. On 
Adrian’s next possession, Mazzoni 
was intercepted by John Fratto, 
who returned the ball 43 yards to 
the Adrian 18. Marmol picked up
13 yards on the first play from 
scrimmage, and Bamyak followed 
with a three-yard touchdown 
scramble to put the Tartans up 
21—17 with 3:17 left in the game.
But the game was far from over. 
With first and ten from the Tar­
tan 39, Mazzoni connected with 
Thompson for a touchdown to put
the Bulldogs on top 23—21. The 
touchdown capped off a three- 
play, 46-yard drive. But the extra 
point attempt by Ivity was blocked 
by nose tackle Marvin Germany" 
and the Tartans found themselves; i 
down by two points with 2:13 lef t.;
“I was so mad after they scored; 
the touchdown,” said Germany.;' 
“because we let them back in the! j 
game and we shouldn’t have. By! ^ 
blocking the extra point, I re-* 1 
deemed myself a little. I just got* j 
in there and bowled over my guy; ! 
and got a piece of the ball.”
Running the two-minute of-; 
fense, the Tartans moved the ball; J 
steadily downfield. Several key! 
third-down conversions, including ] 
a 14-yard catch by Marmol on-' 
fourth-and-two and a 10-yard; | 
catch on third-and-twelve by se-j 
nior receiver Don DeCaro kept | 
the drive alive for the Tartans.; j 
Sçhwerha came in to attempt a [ 
34-yard field goal with just eleven! j 
seconds left on the clock.
The ball sailed through the 
uprights making Schwerha the 1 
hero of the day and giving the i ; 
Tartans a one-point win and a 1 
perfect 4-0 record.
“In a lot of ways, Adrian re- H 
sembled us,” said Germany. “They | 
were tough and aggressive and | 
they were out to play. We knew jj 
from the get-go that we were in<n 
for a game. We also knew that we I 
were just as good as they were •$ 
and that we could beat them. We; .'j 
pulled it out.”
The Tartans return home this 11

ball away from Novaría.
The first 15 minutes of the

CMU got on the board. Fresh­
man Min Chong lofted a high 
pass to junior Young Kang, who

CMU had a few chances to

poor officiating. Twice, Kang

a call on either one. However, 
Brandéis couldn’t capitalize on

The Tartans won the game 7-0, 
but the game wasn’t even that 
close. The Presidents’ lack of 
offense was astounding; W&J 
didn’t even get the ball into 
Carnegie Mellon territory for 
the first 15 minutes of the game.
The Tartans were helped by 
the return of junior defenseman 
Michael Yonas. Yonas, who 
missed all of last season due to 
injury, came in late in the first 
half and played the rest of the 
game for the Tartans.
The Tartans’ attack was once 
again led by Kang, who scored 
the last three Tartan goals to 
earn his first hat trick of the 
year. Junior Rob Schaeffer had 
a pairof goals and nearly scored 
a third. Junior George Gaughan

scored the remaining Tartan 
goals.
The Tartans take to the road

Bonds:‘Tell themPirates clinch NL 
East title
mb I.drL aifrL.Nf
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor 
& CALEB COHEN
! Tartan Staffwriter
September 30,1979. The Pitts­
burgh Pirates clinch the NL East 
title by defeating Philadelphia in 
front of a home crowd.
” September 30, 1990. Eleven 
years to the day, the Pittsburgh 
pirates clinched their first divi­
sion crown since the World 
Champion team of 1979 by de­
feating the St. Louis Cardinals, 
J2-0. They will face the Cincin­
nati Reds in the League Champi­
onship series which opens in Cin­
cinnati October 4th.
The Pirates have been in first 
place virtually the entire season 
and have been holding off a very 
frustrated New York Mets 
¿»allclub. The Pirates entered the 
last week of the season with slight 
lead over their division rivals. 
Facing the nerve-racking task of 
ending the season with New York, 
they wanted to clinch in St. Louis. 
In order to do that, they would 
have to rely on Chicago, visitors 
tp Shea this last weekend of the 
season.
The Cubs fulfilled the Pirate 
wishes by winning on Saturday, 
which, along with the Pirates vic­
tories in the first two games of the 
series with the Cardinals, reduced 
their magic number to one. With 
only a Met loss or a Pirate win, 
the title would be theirs. The 
:Bucs would throw ace starter and 
'Cy Young candidate Doug Drabek 
at the Cards in hopes of clinching 
before the Mets would have a 
chance to ruin their post-season 
party.
* In Magrane’s previous start 
against the Pirates, he held a 1-0 
lead until the ninth where he pro­
ceeded to lose the game 2-1. This 
time, the outcome was nearly the 
same. Magrane entered the eighth 
inning throwing a two hitter, then 
the Bucs turned on the afterburn­
ers.
The Pirates blew open the gates 
in the top half of the eighth. Don 
Slaught and Jose Lind led off the 
inning with consecutive singles. 
Drabek helped himself when 
Magrane botched his sacrifice 
bunt attempt and left the bases 
loaded.
Slaught scored and Lind was 
able to advance when Gary Redus 
lofted a sacrifice fly to deep center
field. Jay Bell was given a 3-0 
count to work with and after 
bringing the count to 3-2, he was 
promptly walked to load the bases 
for Andy Van Slyke. The final 
run was scored when Van Slyke 
grounded out and drove in his 
7 7 th run to ensure the Bucs of the 
pennant.
Later on in the evening, Greater 
Pittsburgh International Airport 
turned into a madhouse as thou­
sands of Pirate fans came out to 
welcome the division champions 
home. The West Terminal was 
packed with jubilant Pirate fans 
for most of the evening.
The airport was a sea of black 
and gold and Green Weenies, with 
many fans bringing homemade 
signs to the celebration. The crowd 
entertained themselves by 
chanting “Let’s Go Bucs” and 
singing “Take Me Out to the 
Ballgame.” For the younger fans, 
the Pirate Parrot put in an ap­
pearance.
Among the crowd was WTAE 
reporter Lynn Cullen. “I’m not 
working tonight,” she said. “I’m 
here because I’m such a big fan of 
the Pirates.”
The crowd remained festive 
despite the fact that the team 
arrivedmore than an hour late. 
According to Janice Melonic of 
the Department of Aviation, the 
delay was caused by “too much 
celebrating in St. Louis.”
Left fielder Barry Bonds put 
the whole thing into perspective: 
“Tell them we did it.”

last opponent in pool play and the 
toughest. Vincent had not dropped 
a game in beating Thiel and 
Geneva.
In the first game Carnegie 
Mellon started off behind by 2—6 
but rolled on to a 15—9 win. The 
next two games were tight but 
Carnegie Mellon lost them both 
10-15,15-17.
The loss did not stop the Tar­
tans from making the playoffs 
along with St. Vincent, California 
University of Pennsylvania and 
the tournament host 
Westminster.
Carnegie Mellon, ranked sec­
ond in its pool, had to play in the 
semi-finals against the number- 
one ranked team in the second 
pool, which was the team from 
Westminster.
In both games CMU was close 
to Westminster until the end. The
score was a close as 8-10 in the 
first game but Westminster 
stopped the Tartans’ pursuit 
there, winning 8-15. The second 
game was much like the first with 
Westminster pulling away from 
Carnegie Mellon toward the end 
to win 15-11.
Head Coach Charlotte Fisher 
was happy with the Tartans’ play 
during the tournament, despite 
not winning in the end.
“Our goal was to qualify for the 
playoffs,” she said. Fisher was 
not disappointed with the loss in 
the semi-finals. “No, I was 
pleased. We played tough. We 
fought the whole way through.”
Senior captain Nicole Hanak 
wasn’t disappointed with the 
team’s performance during the 
day either.
“[It was a] long day.... and I don’t 
think we ever stopped playing 
like a team...”
we did it!’

LACROSSE, from page 13
upon how well the players work with one another, 
stresses captain Peter Vonderlieth. Co-captains 
Bayard Johnson and Phil Kaplan are some of the 
key players in helping to bring the team chemistry 
together.
The chemistry must come together quickly, since 
the team will be playing in the Gesling Stadium 
October 6 and 7. On Saturday at 6:30 pm, the 
opponent will be Slippery Rock, one of the most 
physical teams in the league. On Sunday at 2 pm, 
the PLC (Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club) will be the 
opponent in line.
October 20, CMU will be heading to WVU for a 
tournament.
CMU is full of confidence toward these upcoming 
games, despite minor injuries to some players and 
also the loss of players to graduating. Managers 
Cathy Flowers, Maggie Dobkin, Zoey Juhng, and 
Jennifer Sherer will have their work cut out for 
them as they tend to the team’s injuries.
The team is preoccupied with other worries also. 
With funding tight, the idea of becoming a varsity 
sport could alleviate many of the team’s problems.
The Carnegie Mellon la­
crosse team is still hoping 
for the best season in its 
history, sporting an attitude 
that will help it get there 
....the CMU lacrosse club 
has its eyes on a landmark 
season.
Although such an event will most likely not be­
come reality in the near future, the Carnegie Mellon 
lacrosse team is still hoping for the best season in its 
history, sporting an attitude that will help it get 
there. Boasting tough defense lines, goalies and 
middle lines, team unity, and confidence, the 
Carnegie Mellon lacrosse club has its eyes on a 
landmark season.

ox, D.C.
Everyone knows it's there. Almost everyone's been there. 
But do you really know what there is to do in Washington,
D.C.?
Probably not. The tourist attractions are many, and there is 
usually little time to see all of them.
However, there is one important fact.
You should see all of them.
Once you get there, there's plenty to do, and you should 
have no problem amusing yourself. It is a diverse, fast-paced 
city with no ends. Looking at various areas of the city, you can 
see the amount there is to do. So sit back, relax, and enjoy this 
tour of Washington by words....
Washington, D.C.
The city itself becomes an attraction for more than 17 
million people a year. It's no surprise that when you're there, 
there will probably be many tourists at all the attractions. The 
city itself has a population of just under 650,000, making it one 
of the 20 largest cities in the U.S.
Capitol Hill
This area, probably one of the most active and most beauti­
ful of the city, includes the U.S. Capitol building, the meeting 
place of Congress; the Supreme Court; and the Library of 
Congress. The National Visitors Center is also located in this 
area of town, and is a great place to get more information about 
the city.
While there, the U.S. Capitol and the Library of Congress 
are two things that you shouldn't miss. The Capitol tour allows 
you to see sessions of Congress (if they're in session) and the 
beauty of the building. You have the best chance of catching 
them if you go on Monday. Congress normally isn't in session 
on weekends, but it is possible if an urgent matter arises. Go 
early, as these tours fill up fast.
The Library of Congress doesn't have a tour, but it is open 
to the public. You can find amazing books here, and the main 
reading room is not to be missed. (If you look hard, you should 
be able to find copies of The Tartan there somewhere.)
The Mall
Just as we have our own mall here at Carnegie Mellon, the 
Mall extending west of the Capitol building is the central point 
of all Washington, D.C. Walking west from the Capitol, there 
are many small art galleries, as well as the huge National 
Gallery of Art. Anyone can enjoy this art museum, since it 
houses everything from the Renaissance to modern works of art 
and sculpture.
Also located along the Mall are the Smithsonian Museums, 
also known as the Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian 
Museums are comprised of the Great Hall, the National Air and 
Space Museum, the National Museum of Natural History, the 
National Museum of Man, and the National Museum of 
American History. Together, they create what is perhaps the 
most stunning collection of history, art and science anywhere in 
the world. The Air and Space Museum is one of the most 
popular attractions in Washington, and houses Charles 
Lindberg's "Spirit of St. Louis," several samples of moon rock, 
and a hot air balloon, among other exhibits.
Farther west, the end of the Mall is home to the reflecting 
pool and the 555 foot Washington Monument. Also along this 
route are the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials, both to the south 
side of the mall. Looking farther south, Arlington National 
Cemetery is across the Potomac River. North of the Mall a short 
distance away is the Vietnam Memorial, dedicated in 1982.
This is another no-miss area.
The White House
No one would forget to tour the White House, right? Of 
course not. However, the area around it contains many small 
attractions. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is near here, as is 
the Treasury building. There are monuments, memorials, and 
famous houses galore in a one-square-mile area around the 
executive mansion.
How TO GET THERE:
Take the 1-376 east to the Pennsylvania Turnpike east.
When it splits, continue along 1-70 south. Take 1-70 until its 
junction with 1-270. Follow 1-270 south, and you're in 
Washington D.C.
4 1/2 HOURS FROM PITTSBURGH
Georgetown
Washington doesn't only consist of important national 
landmarks. Georgetown is one place to just relax and enjoy.
Located in the northwest portion of Washington, this area 
of the city contains historic Georgetown University, one of the 
nation's oldest colleges. In the beginning of the century, 
Georgetown became a beautiful residential area. It remains so, 
and now has many sidewalk shopping areas for visitors to 
browse. Georgetown University is also a worthwhile tour stop.
Other Areas
It would take a whole newspaper to go through the list of 
sights to see in Washington. Other attractions not to miss 
include the J. Edgar Hoover Building, located downtown and 
home to the FBI, and the CIA headquarters, across the river.
The Old Post Office on 12th Street is a beautiful example of 
older buildings in Washington. Other sights include the 
numerous cathedrals located in the city, as well as the smaller 
art galleries, libraries, old houses, and famous landmarks.
Pick a street and walk down it; finding something to tour is 
easy in Washington.

As this issue goes to press, Philadelphia wobbles just on 
the brink of sucking itself and everything in the surrounding 20 
miles into total monetary oblivion. But no matter.. All you need 
to know is that this is the best time to visit Philadelphia. Go 
now, before winter brings its fist down all the way and before 
Cleveland buys up half of the landmarks at the bankruptcy 
auction.
Start your tour at the Franklin Institute, which began as a 
museum dedicated to the history of science and technology. 
Late this spring, an almost complete overhaul made its new 
Futures Center the centerpiece of the museum. Many of the 
older exhibits survived the remodeling, such as those devoted 
to electricity, general physics, aerospace, mathematics, and 
time, although most of these received some enhancements as 
well. The Institute that emerged from the fusion now straddles 
past and anticipated future.
Admission prices vary, depending on whether or not you 
choose to buy tickets to the Fels Planetarium and the 
Omniverse Theater. Unless you are extremely strapped for 
cash or time, buy the tickets. Both shows are quite worthwhile.
The venerable Fels Planetarium shows programs which 
usually last half an hour. The domed room does its job more 
than well; even before the projectors start up, the muted 
acoustics, fresh air, and dim blue lighting have the visitor half 
convinced that the city has been left hundreds of miles behind 
for a quiet moonlit field. The shows, with their gently moving 
visuals and casual, low voice-overs, cast a relaxing spell. Don't 
worry about falling asleep, though — the experience of watch­
ing a show projected on the underside of a dome, not to men­
tion the unusual subjects, will keep you wide awake and 
interested, despite the pacific setting.
"Relaxing" is probably not the word for the Institute's 
other projection system, the Omniverse theater. Only seasoned 
fighter pilots or the heavily sedated will be able to avoid 
flinching at least once in the course of a show. The screen is 
three stories high and curves inward horizontally and vertically 
to cover almost the entire forward viewing angle of its audi­
ence, which sits along the opposite wall in a clifflike arrange­
ment. The illusion of motion is virtually perfect, sometimes 
dizzyingly so. Something about watching a launching Space 
Shuttle at a good fraction of actual size leaves an impression on 
the viewer. If you can only see one thing at the musuem, attend 
an Omniverse show. It leaves 3-D movies looking flat, and tops 
a good number of roller coasters for sheer vertigo.
Penn's Landing is as scenic as any section of the Delaware 
River in the Philadelphia area gets. Generally, this is not 
terribly strong praise, but Penn's Landing is actually quite 
pleasant. Points of interest along this extended pedestrian 
walkway include the U.S. Maritime history museum, and the 
U.S.S. Olympia and Becuna. The Olympia and Becuna are, 
respectively, a battleship from the Spanish-American war and a 
World-War-II vintage submarine. Both have now found their 
final mooring places as tourable floating history lessons.
Appeal to maritime history buffs aside, those in the know 
regard Penn's Landing as a prelude to South Street.
After passing the Olympia and Becuna from the direction 
of the Maritime museum, cross 1-95 and then continue to follow 
the direction of the Delaware. After passing Philadelphia's 
Vietnam veterans' memorial, you will come to an inoffensive- 
looking parking lot overlooking the end of Penn's Landing.
Do not be deceived. You stand at the beginning of South 
Street.
Depending on your viewpoint, South Street is either one of 
the most bizarre places in Philadelphia, or one of the most 
entertaining. Possibly both. It's the city's repository for things 
and people too odd or offbeat to expose the general public to.
On a seasonable day, it's the perfect place to kill an after­
noon. Among the restaurants, bistros, and cafés are various 
small shops offering quick and portable noshes, like water ice
and the Philadelphia specialty, 
cheesesteak. A little way to your right at 
the first major intersection is Caroline's 
Bakery, thought by many to offer the 
best chocolate chip cookies in Philadel­
phia.
There's almost as much variety in 
clothing as in food. Hats in the Belfry 
offers headgear both mundane and 
exotic. Various corner stores sell T-Shirts 
ranging from black Bart Simpson 
bootlegs to pleasant reminders of your 
stay in Philly ("I went to Philadelphia, 
and got mugged, beaten up, and raped, 
but I still had a good time!"). Last, but 
certainly not least, are Kinki Bobo's and 
Zipperhead, your only source for the latest in designer plastic, 
rubber, and leather (yes, we are still on the subject of clothing).
Tower Records offers one of the widest selections of tapes, 
CDs, and LPs around. At other small stores, role-playing and 
comics enthusiasts will find sourcebooks, game sets, minia­
tures, and graphic (some, extremely graphic) novels galore. 
Antiques of almost every kind, from furniture to books, are to 
be found. For those whose wallets possess more than the mere 
illusion of depth, there's even a store selling holographic art.
If touring the city is not your cup of tea, there are two very 
good alternatives.
Longwood Gardens, located in Langhorne, about one, hour 
from Philadelphia, was originally an estate of the Pierce- 
DuPont (of DuPont Chemical fame) family. The estate is now 
open to the public for $8. The Gardens cover several hundred 
acres, and are divided into areas of widely varying style: 
carefully tended rose bushes and topiary animals at one 
extreme, an open field, with mown paths leading through the 
tall grass, at the other.
Even in the dead of winter, or on the rainiest day of the 
season, Longwood Gardens is still worth visiting. Its vast 
conservatories cover several acres all their own, and include 
flora from almost every environment, ranging from full-grown 
tropical fruit trees, draped with hanging vines, to several dozen 
different varieties of cactus.
There are also several specialty greenhouses adjacent to the 
primary ones, showcasing themes such as medicines and herbs, 
carnivorous plants, and orchids. The orchid display in particu­
lar is a must-see.
Visitors who wish to spend the better portion of the day 
will be able to break for lunch or dinner at the Terrace restau­
rant, located immediately opposite the conservatories. •
The Tyler Arboretum, like Longwood Gardens, began as a 
private estate; unlike Longwood, however, it was first parceled 
out among various heirs.
The Arboretum is much less cultivated than Longwood 
Gardens. Most of it is simply hilly woods. The visitor's center 
sells postcards, handcrafted goods, and birdseed, amoung other 
things. Buy what you will, but make sure you get a map, which 
will give you a little of the historical background of the park, 
and, hopefully, a passing chance of knowing where you are.
The danger of getting seriously lost is slim, however, since 
the Arboretum is not large enough for you to be able to walk 
more than an hour without returning to a recognizable spot or 
a clearly marked trail. Besides, there's great sport in getting 
lost; several ruins from the Arboretum's days as private real 
estate dot the landscape, and since they are unmarked on the 
map, are most likely found by those who do not know where 
they're going.

Toronto is an international city that sits on the edge of Lake 
Ontario. Like Chicago and New York City, it is brimming with 
cultural diversity, a hopping nightlife, shopping opportunities 
galore, and an abundance of skyscrapers. Unlike its American 
counterparts, however, Toronto is a very clean city, due to strict 
Canadian laws. The city is big enough to be a major cosmopoli­
tan area but small enough that you can't get lost; the CN 
Tower, which on a clear day can be seen from across the lake in 
the U.S., is a convenient reference point.
A taste of old Toronto can be found with a visit to Old Fort 
York. Established in 1783, this fort was the scene of a bloody 
battle during the War of 1812. Although mid-semester break is 
beyond the summer's schedule of battle-scene reenactments it's 
still worth the trip.
Also worth the trip is Mackenzie House, at 82 Bond Street, 
home of Toronto's first mayor, William Lyon Mackenzie. 
Mackenzie's ghost is said to walk the staircase and play the 
piano on occasion. The nineteenth century furnishings and 
Mackenzie family heirlooms are on display for the curious.
For the culturally inclined, three "must-see" places in 
Toronto are the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), the adjacent 
McLaughlin Planetarium, and the Art Gallery of Toronto. The 
ROM's collection of artifacts range from Mesopotamian art to 
ancient Greek gold to thirteenth century Chinese temple wall 
paintings. With over 9000 works spread over twenty galleries, 
The Art Gallery of Toronto, at the heart of Chinatown, is well 
worth the $4 admission.
You should include the world famous CN Tower on your 
list of sites to see. A trip to the top reveals a view that is simply 
breathtaking. A trip to the bottom of the CN Tower provides an 
adventure of a different kind. The highly touted (and some­
what overpriced at about $11) Tour of the Universe is a major 
tourist attraction. The tour starts at a spaceport at the base of 
the tower taking you through a history of mankind's space 
exploration. It concludes with a trip to the outer reaches of the 
galaxy via an all-too-short but incredible flight simulator ride.
Still more touristy places to see are the Ontario Science 
Centre, Carling O'Keefe Brewery, the new Skydome — home of 
the Blue Jays — the Toronto Zoological Gardens, Casa Loma, 
Ontario Place, and Queen's Quay (pronounced "kee"). The first 
four are self-explanatory, and the last three you can easily 
figure out for yourself.
Shopping opportunities abound in Toronto. The Eaton 
Centre is a monument to the "urge to splurge." Stores, shops, 
and restaurants of every kind can be found on this four-level 
complex. Even if you've already found that memento of 
Toronto you've been looking for, you should go inside just to 
see the sights and heights Canadian capitalism has reached.
While in the shopping mode, check out two other signifi­
cant neighborhoods: Bloor Street and Yonge Street. Bloor and 
Bay Streets are home to many upper-end shops and boutiques, 
many of which can be found under a single roof, namely the 
Holt Renfrew Centre. More than forty shops can be found in 
this grandiose building including the work of many posh 
Toronto fashion and jewelry designers.
Yonge Street is the strip in Toronto. On Yonge, you can find 
just about anything you could ever want. For example, it has 
some of Toronto's most prominent banks, a colorful cross- 
section of its population, a major portion of its record stores, 
book stores, restaurants, pubs, head shops, in addition to a 
wide variety of stores and "theaters" which pride themselves 
with some of the most sexually deviant material allowed by 
law. You can spend the major part of an entire day just by 
walking from one end of Yonge Street to the other. The nights 
in between the days of your visit are an adventure in them­
selves.
Once you've wasted away the day shopping or just seeing
the sights, a plethora of dining 
opportunities await your hungry 
stomach. Over thirty different 
kinds of cuisine are available 
including Argentine, Egyptian,
Chinese, and Vietnamese. All it 
takes is a little bit of common 
sense to find them. Consult the 
Toronto Star or the Visitor's 
Information on the ground floor 
of the Eaton Centre.
After you've had your fill, 
you will discover that Toronto 
has some of the best nightlife this 
side of New York. There are a 
number of clubs, bars, and pubs 
on Yonge Street, including North 
America's first Hard Rock Cafe.
The Toronto version may be a bit 
of a disappointment, especially if 
you've been to other Hard Rocks.
It's a hopping place but it doesn't 
have the electricity or variety that 
you might expect. You can still 
get the t-shirts, sweatshirts, 
jackets and so on, and its corner 
bar atmosphere may be just what you're looking for after a 
hard day on the streets of Toronto.
However, the Hard Rock Cafe is a far cry from the nightlife 
on Queen Street West. This is definitely the place to be. Here 
you can find several hot clubs with some of the best bands in all 
of Toronto. This is also the place to find original jewelry and 
pre-trendy clothing.
A few facts about Toronto and the nightlife: the legal 
drinking age is 19 and ID is required at just about every place 
that serves. The bars stop serving alcohol at 1 am but remain 
open until 3. It's also illegal to drink alcohol on the street. The 
police, called Mounties, don't fool around and neither should 
you.
This brings up a few things to remember. You will be in a 
foreign country. On your way you will pass through Customs 
at the border. Take the Customs inspector seriously. He or she 
will ask you your citizenship, place of birth, and destination. 
Answer with respect and courtesy. Customs inspectors are 
often suspicious of college students mostly due to our age and 
often non-standard dress.
One small but important difference exists between the trip 
there and the trip back. On your return trip, the U.S. Customs 
inspector will ask you how long you've been in Canada and if 
you have anything to declare. By "declare," he or she is asking 
what, if anything, you have purchased in Canada and are 
bringing back across the border. If you stay less than forty-eight 
hours and spent more than $25, then you have to pay a duty 
fee. This spending limit extends to $100 if you stayed for more 
than two days.
Although most inspectors don't take the time to search 
your car, they have the legal right to do so. They can take 
everything apart, down to removing the back seats and check­
ing the insides of the tires. And they are not required by law to 
put it back together when done.
The monetary unit of Canada is the Canadian dollar. 
Approximately 80 cents in American money is worth a dollar of 
Canadian money. It's probably easiest to just stop in to a bank 
and convert your money when you first get to Canada rather 
than trying to use American dollars on the streets of Toronto.

How TO GET Fju­u7
The quickest way to Toronto is 
to take 1-79 north to the 1-90 to 
Buffalo. Cross the Peace Bridge; 
from there take the Q.E.W. (Queen 
Elizabeth Way) Niagara to the 
Q.E.W. Toronto, which goes 
straight to the heart of the city via 
the Gardenville Expressway. The 
speed limit in Ontario is 100 kilo­
meters per hour, approximately 63 
mph.

However, further inspection shows a strange sight: a 
warmly dressed fisherman walking down the beach. He 
approaches a pier and looks up at a sign reading, "Presque Isle 
State Park." This isn't Spring Break — it's midsemester break at 
Lake Erie.
Presque Isle State Park, a peninsula next to the city of Erie, 
is an ideal place to spend a warm fall day. Many picnic tables 
are located throughout the sandy park. Boating is another 
popular activity; canoes, rowboats, and motorboats can be 
rented at a site in the park. Hiking and fishing are also avail­
able, though no lifeguards are on duty between Labor Day and 
Memorial Day.
Trout and salmon fishing seasons last all year on Lake Erie; 
fishing on the lake's tributaries is allowed only during the day. 
Other kinds of fish in the area include coho salmon, largemouth 
bass, smallmouth bass, and panfish. For more fishing informa­
tion call the Fish Commission's fishing and boating hot line.
The shoreline of Lake Erie is also known for its wineries. 
You can take tours of the winemaking process, which are 
usually followed by a tasting of wines from that vineyard. 
Wineries in the area include Heritage Wine Cellars, Mazza 
Vineyards, Penn Shore Vineyards, and Presque Isle Wine 
Cellars. All are located a short distance from the city of Erie. 
Penn Shore Vineyards operates a shop locally in North Hills 
during the months of November and December.
A reconstruction of Commodore Oliver H. Perry's flagship, 
the Niagral, is one of many historical sites found in the area. 
Others include Perry Memorial House, a part of the Under­
ground Railroad to Canada; Warner Theatre, built by the 
famous Warner Brothers in 1929; and the Eagle Hotel, where 
the only known statue of George Washington in a British 
uniform is located.

How TO GET THERE:
Take 1-376 east to the Pennsyl­
vania turnpike, and travel east 
to Interstate 70 south. Instead of 
getting off at 1-270 like you 
would if you were going to 
Washington D.C., stay on 1-70. It 
will lead you straight into Balti­
more.
4 1/2 HOURS FROM 
Pittsburgh
Baltimore is a short day's drive and a perfect spot to spend a long weekend. Full of shops, 
restaurants, and other attractions, Baltimore is an exciting place to spend some time, or a conve­
nient "home base" for visiting other cities.
If you want to get "up close and personal" with the water, a boat tour of Baltimore Harbor 
and the surrounding rivers might be in order. For more fun in the water, you can also rent boats 
which are operated bicycle-style and paddle around in the water to your heart's delight.
For those of you who like to look at water without necessarily being in it, Baltimore also 
offers attractions on shore. The Inner Harbor/Harbor Place area, a collection of fine restaurants 
and shops, provides a nice view of the adjacent harbor (hence the name) and is a popular tourist 
attraction. The city is also home to the famous National Aquarium in Baltimore, which is 
definitely worth seeing. One unusual feature is a ramp spiralling around a fishtank four floors 
high. The Aquarium costs $9.25, but if you're 18 or under you can get in at the student rate of 
$7.25. They admit people from 10 am to 5 pm but you're allowed to stay in for one and a half 
hours after closing. On fridays, it's open until 8 pm. There's also a science center, which is fun, 
but mainly for kids.
Besides having so much to offer itself, Baltimore is also very close to some other major 
attractions and a nice place to stay if you want to do some exploring. Annapolis, home of the 
United States Naval Academy and a beautiful little town, is only 40 minutes away. If you drive 
for an hour, you will be in Washington D.C., and can enjoy the city without having to stay there.
Although Baltimore may not be the first thing that pops into your mind when someone 
mentions midsemester break, think about it. It's a beautiful city with a lot to offer, but not so 
much that you can't handle it in a weekend.

How TO GET Fju­u7
Take 1-279 north to 1-79. From there, the trip is 
simple. It's 131 miles one-way, entirely on Interstate 
79 north.

Looking at the calm, open waters and the boats at harbor on Lake Erie, It's easy to understand why 
boating is one of Erie’s most popular attractions.

---------------------------------------------------

ri-nei unvmg eigm nuuib uuuugii what seems to be the 
world's largest continuous corn field, it may be hard to believe 
that you could possibly have arrived in the nation's third 
largest city, trailing only New York and Los Angeles in popula­
tion and second only to New York in financial influence.
But that's exactly what Chicago is. Located on the western 
shore of Lake Michigan, Chicago has all the excitement and 
possibilities of any of the world's major cities and much of the 
laid-back midwestern atmosphere of the surrounding areas.
One could not possibly see all of Chicago's attractions in a 
weekend any more than one could do so in any city. The 
following are some suggested places to go and things to do 
from a native Chicagoan.
The Museum of Science and Industry on the city's South 
Side is nearly worth a trip from Pennsylvania on its own. Kids 
(and many adults) love the interactive exhibits which highlight 
everything from money to nutrition to the circus. The 
museum's highlights include a captured German U-boat, a coal 
mine, and the Omnimax Theater, which shows movies that put 
you in middle of the action. Many of the exhibits feature 
scientific concepts, but visitors without technical backgrounds 
should not be scared off. The 2000 exhibits, which cover 75 
fields are all designed to emphasize fun first and learning as a 
distant second.
The Art Institute of Chicago on Michigan Avenue down­
town is not one of my favorites, but for those people who do 
have an appreciation for art it is well worth an afternoon. It is 
one of America's great art museums.
The Adler Planetarium, located just south of downtown, 
features exhibits on astronomy, space exploration, and related 
subjects. The exhibits are interesting, but the real reason to go 
is the Sky Show, a multimedia show related to space. The 
highlight of the show is the second half, in which a 
multimillion dollar projection device (which you will have to 
see to believe) illustrates the movements of astronomical bodies 
against the 180 degree interior of the building's dome. The 
current Sky Show is "Ticket to the Stars."
The Field Museum of Natural History is within a healthy 
walk of the Adler Planetarium. Featuring collections from the 
fields of anthropology, botany, geology, and zoology, it is 
supposedly one of the world's four greatest natural history 
museums. It is not as much fun as the Museum of Science and 
Industry, but the reconstructed dinosaurs, stuffed remains of 
elephants and one of Chicago's favorite gorillas, as well as 
other the exhibits, make it one of the city's highlights.
The Shedd Aquarium, roughly halfway between the 
planetarium and the Field Museum, is the world's largest 
indoor aquarium and has 6,600 aquatic animals in 200 exhibits. 
The Coral Reef Exhibit offers the opportunity to see a diver feed 
sharks, eels, sea turtles, and other animals at 11 am and 2 pm 
daily. The aquarium is not a must-see attraction, but it is worth 
stopping for a while if you find yourself walking by.
How TO GET CompmS
Take 1-279 north to 1-79 north, and 
go to the Pennsylvania Turnpike 
west. Stay on that road. It will first 
turn into the Ohio turnpike, and 
then into the Indiana turnpike.
You'll see signs to Chicago.
8 HOURS FROM PITTSBURGH
In downtown Chicago, the Sears Tower dominates the skyline.
The Board of Trade on LaSalle and Jackson Streets offers 
the opportunity to watch the world's largest commodities 
futures exchange in action. It is only open on weekdays but if 
you happen to be downtown on Monday or Friday it is worth 
a brief stop.
The Sears Tower and the John Hancock Building down­
town both offer nice views of the city. They charge admission 
though, so you should only go on a clear day. If you miss them 
altogether, you'll live.
Chicago Stadium, home of the Chicago Bulls (NBA) and 
Blackhawks (NHL), is just west of downtown. The Bulls have a 
home game on October 13 and the Blackhawks. are home the 
next day. A word of caution: Chicago Stadium is in a moder­
ately bad part of town. Don't be afraid to go there but you are 
better off driving at night and you definitely want to use the 
paid parking lots.
The Chicago Bears (NFL) have a home game on October 14 
south of downtown in Soldier Field, but tickets are not much 
easier to come by than Steelers' tickets.
Any of the top comedy clubs are well worth an evening.
Some of the best are Catch a Rising Star, The Funny Firm, The 
Improv, Second City (named before L.A. took this title from 
Chicago), and Zanies Comedy Night Club. Admission prices 
and policies on admitting people under 21 vary.
The Lyric Opera and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 
both downtown, have a number of performances during the 
weekend of midsemester break.
There are, as in any city, many places to shop. Some of the 
best are along the northern portion of Michigan Ave. down­
town. Water Tower Place is a seven floor indoor shopping 
center with many of the best stores in town. Most of the other 
top stores are within walking distance.
Chicago Deep Dish Pizza! Chicago is home to some of the 
best pizza in the world. Edwardo's and Giordano's are two of 
my favorite restaurants. Both have locations in Hyde Park, the 
neighborhood which contains the Museum of Science and 
Industry and the University of Chicago. If you can't make it to 
either of these, stop any native Chicagoan and ask for a recom­
mendation; you can't lose.
For more information on things to do in Chicago, call the 
Chicago Department of Tourism.

Art, on Fifth Ave. and 82nd Street; Lincoln 
Center for the Performing Arts, located at 
Broadway and Columbus Avenues at 66th 
Street; Macy's, the world's largest depart­
ment store; and the Hard Rock Cafe.
As for night life, if you think this is a 24- 
hour campus, you haven't been to New 
York. The city never sleeps. At any time of 
the morning, you can find something to do.
Just pick up a paper, ask a friend, or call a 
place you spotted on the street during the 
day.
Let me offer a couple of words of 
warning. No, you won't necessarily get 
mugged, robbed or beaten if you walk on 
the streets of New York. Yes, you should 
probably not walk alone, especially if it is at 
night or you are female. The subways aren't 
so bad and are much cheaper than taking taxis all over. They 
are also easier to figure out than the bus system in New York 
because you can just pick up a color-coded subway map.
It's easy to feel swamped by New York, but once you get 
into the fast pace of the city, and believe me, the energy on the 
streets is enough to perk you up, you'll have a great time. •
How TO GET THERE:
Take 1-376 east to the Pennsylvania 
Turnpike east to Interstate 81.
There are signs on the Turnpike for 
1-81, but you have to get off at 
Carlisle and go on a local road for 
no more than a mile. Take 1-81 east 
towards Harrisburg. 1-81 turns into 
1-78, which will end at the New 
Jersey Turnpike. Take the Turnpike 
north and follow signs to the Lin­
coln Tunnel.
8 HOURS FROM

The cardinal rule for visiting New York City is don't try to 
do it all. Your best bet is to pick an area and devote a whole day 
to it rather than running from place to place.
One area to hit is Fifth Avenue starting at the Empire State 
Building on 34th Street. The Empire State has two observation 
decks, and you can ride up to both for the same admission 
price. Expect to wait, but once you get through the lines for the 
tickets and elevators, the view is magnificent.
Continue up Fifth Avenue until you hit Central Park. You'll 
pass some of the most expensive and famous stores around, 
like Fendi, Gucci,. Tiffany's, Godiva, and Fortunoff's, as well as 
Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral. One of the city's 
most famous cathedrals, St. Patrick's offers a view of its breath­
taking stain-glass windows and beautiful architecture. But be 
respectful, there's likely to be a mass in progress.
Between 49th and 51st Streets you'll find Rockefeller 
Center. Stop and watch the ice skaters on the famous rink; some 
of them are quite good. Just behind Rock Center, one block off 
Fifth, is Radio City Music Hall. Sacks Fifth Avenue is directly 
across from Rockefeller Center.
Continuing down Fifth you'll see Trump Tower, which is 
worth wandering into, even if you can't afford to buy anything. 
The decor is a fantasy of glass, chrome and indoor water walls 
come true. When you reach central park, FAO Schwartz will be 
on your right and the Plaza Hotel will be on your left. Wander 
into the lobby of the beautiful Plaza Hotel, but more impor­
tantly, don't miss FAO Schwartz. There's usually a line to get 
in through the main revolving doors, which enter into a fantasy 
land of singing toys, giant Lego men, and a jungle of life size 
stuffed animals.
If you travel south to downtown Manhattan, you'll hit the 
Wall Street financial district and the World Trade Center. The 
World Trade Center has an observation deck for a moderate 
admission charge. A boardwalk runs along the water across 
from the Trade Center, and if you travel south along it you'll 
reach a big, ugly blue building. This is the terminal for the 
Staten Island Ferry. If you don't want to pay $15 or so for a boat 
tour around the city, you might want to pay the 25 cents for the 
round trip ferry ride. You'll get a good view of the Statue of 
Liberty, downtown Manhattan, and the Verazzano bridge.
About ten minutes east of the Wall Street area is South 
Street Seaport. Located half on Pier 17 and half on Fulton and 
South Streets, the Seaport has a variety of shops, restaurants 
and a maritime museum. You can also usually find a variety of 
street entertainers to watch.
Greenwich Village is another area of New York that is 
worth a day's trip. You might want to start on Broadway 
around 8th Street, where the more well known stores, such as 
Unique, Antique Boutique, and Tower Records, are located. 
From there, wander towards Washington Square park and the 
famous arch. By the way, you'll probably notice that you're in 
the heart of NYU. Stop for lunch at the.Waverly Cafe on 
Waverly Place, one block off Broadway. It's a great coffee shop 
with muffins that are out of this world.
Wandering the village can get kind of tricky since the 
orderly numbers of Manhattan Streets disintegrate into small 
winding streets with names. But getting lost on the streets of 
the village isn't necessarily bad. You're practically guaranteed 
to see something you've never seen before. Venture into some 
of the more bizarre boutiques and try not to act frightened.
Go see a Broadway show, after all, New York is the only 
place you can. It doesn't have to cost a fortune. You can buy 
Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets for half price at Times 
Square Center in Duffy Square. Show up at the bright orange 
booth, in the triangular park in between Broadway and 47th 
Street, early in the morning and be prepared to wait on a 
usually lengthy line. The tickets you'll wind up getting are hit 
and miss because they sell out quickly. But I've caught several 
good shows.
More sights of interest are the United Nations, located on 
First Ave. and 42nd Street; the Museum of Natural History, at 
Central Park West and 79th Street; the Metropolitan Museum of

City
How TO GET THERE;
Atlantic City conjures up many 
images: The Boardwalk, casinos,
Monopoly, salt-water taffy, the Miss 
America Pageant. However, the dream 
and the reality are completely different 
things.
Before you think of traveling the 
300 miles or so it takes to get to Atlantic 
City, take heed: you must be at least 21 
years of age to gamble in the casinos.
Unlike Las Vegas, Atlantic City is very 
strict about who they let into the
casinos. So, don't count on sneaking into the casinos if you're 
underage because more than likely you'll get caught.
Second, staying in Atlantic City can become very expensive. 
The casino-hotels cost hundreds to stay in for just one night. 
However, on the outskirts of Atlantic City all along Route 40, 
you can find dozens of motels which will only cost around $30 
to $40 per night. These motels are only a few miles from the 
casinos, and you'll save a fortune.
Finally, gambling itself costs a lot of money. Forget the fact 
that you will more than likely lose most of what you gamble. 
Make sure to take into account that at most tables the minimum 
bet is $5. Although you can find some $2 tables if you look hard 
enough, don't count on gambling there because those tables are 
usually packed. The only game which won't cost you at least $5 
a pop is the slots, but they usually have the worst odds.
Now that the unpleasantries are out of the way, you can 
explore some of the attractions to be found in Atlantic City.
Getting around the town is fairly easy. Since all the casinos 
are right next to each other (except for Harrah's and the Trump 
Castle, which are on the marina) and connected by the Board­
walk, it doesn't take long to explore them all. Just park your car 
in one of the several parking garages (each casino has one) and 
then expect to do a lot of walking.
Probably your best bet is to park at the Trump Plaza garage 
since it's located at the center of the Boardwalk. It's also right 
across from Ocean One, a shopping mall built on the site of the 
legendary Million Dollar Pier — where, many years ago, one 
could go and see a horse and rider dive into the ocean. Ocean 
One is a extremely attractive mall, with over 150 shops and 
restaurants that feature just about everything. It's probably the 
best shopping to be found in Atlantic City.
Besides Ocean One, you can find a wide range of shops
Take the Pennsylvania Turnpike to Philadelphia, there 
it turns into the Schuylkill Expressway which runs 
over the Walt Whitman Bridge. Immediately after the 
bridge head south on Route 42. This will take you to 
the Atlantic City Expressway which will lead you 
straight into the center of Atlantic City.
7 1/2 HOURS FROM PITTSBURGH
along the Boardwalk itself. Some places to try are Fralinger's, 
the original creators of salt-water taffy, and a fast-food place 
called Dip-Stick, which has amazing corn dogs and wicked 
lemonade. Both of these shops can be found anywhere on the 
Boardwalk, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding them.
As for the entertainment (besides the gambling, of course) 
you will have to rely mostly on the casinos. The entertainment 
found at the casinos can be broken into two general categories: 
big room and lounge.
The big rooms can house over a thousand people and 
usually have top notch stars performing there. However, these 
shows usually run about $40 or so and it's pretty hard to get 
tickets unless you're a guest at the hotel. But if you're lucky and 
make reservations one or two days in advance you might be 
able to get in a big room.
The lounges are much smaller and more intimate than the 
big rooms and offer fairly good entertainment. Most of the 
lounge acts consist of live music, dancing, or a well-known 
performer. The usual cost to watch lounge entertainment is a 
drink minimum; shows are performed 24 hours a day.
More traditional forms of entertainment, such as movies, 
can be found close by to the-casinos and hotels. If you travel 
around ten miles down Route 40, past all the cheap motels, 
you'll eventually come to a huge shopping mall and a movie 
complex that houses 16 theaters. It's usually a safe bet that you 
can find something to see there.
To find even more entertainment, you should also check 
out the local free weeklies The Sun and Whoot, as well as any 
literature the casinos have.
When it comes to eating in Atlantic City, your choices are 
even more plentiful than the entertainment. Each casino has at 
least six different restaurants, as well as several smaller cafes 
and snack bars. Probably the best two places to find food are 
the food court in Ocean One and the Sands Hotel-Casino. Both 
offer just about every type of culinary choice at their food 
courts, and all at reasonable prices.
Finally, don't forget one of the main attractions to be found 
in Atlantic City — the beach. The casinos, as well as the local 
police force, keep the beaches sparkling clean, making them 
ideal for sunbathing. The best time of year to go down and do a 
little sunning is during the basic summer months, May to 
August. However, if you happen to miss the optimal season, 
having the beach nearby makes for nice breezes and cool 
weather all year.
So, if you're planning on heading down to the Boardwalk, 
make sure to pack your swim trunks, your Monopoly board, 
and money. Lots and lots of money, because no matter what 
your friends, the ads, and the casinos tell you, your pockets are 
always lighter on the way back home.

Atlantic City offers a wide range of shops and entertainment, and for those over 21, casinos.

How TO GET THERE:
Take 279 north into 1-79, then follow 1-79 north to the 
junction with 1-90. Go east on 1-90, which becomes 
the N.Y. State Thruway. Get off at exit 5B, take 1-90 
West. Follow that through Buffalo, over Grand Is­
land, and into Niagara Falls. Get off at the Robert 
Moses Parkway West, which takes you right to the 
falls.
4: HOURS FROM PITTSBURGH
Alison Green/Tartan Asst. Magazine Editor 
On the American side of Niagara Falls, the passengers aboard the Maid of the Mist enjoy a view of the 
base of the American Falls before turning away and entering the basin of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls.
I leaned over the rail, letting the mist from the Falls soak " 
my face. About 180 feet below, I could see the base of the 
American Falls and a boatload of people headed straight for it. 
Two weekends ago, I spent the weekend in Buffalo, and took a 
day trip to Niagara Falls. Although a five-hour trip from 
Pittsburgh to the Falls might seem pointless, there's a lot to do 
while you're there.
Niagara Falls is the oldest state park in the United States. It 
was established back in 1885, and it has attracted visitors from 
all over the world ever since. Niagara Falls is divided into two 
sections: the American Falls and the Canadian Horseshoe Falls. 
There's an ongoing argument between people who have been 
to both sides of the Falls about which side is the most beautiful. 
Both falls are visible from the American side, but if you have 
the time, see both sides.
Opportunities to get closer to the action make the Falls 
different from other state parks: every fifteen minutes, a boat 
called the Maid of the Mist sails to the base of the American Falls 
and into the basin of the Horseshoe Falls. If you don't mind 
getting drenched — and believe me, if you can see the guard­
rails, you're already wet — you can't leave the Falls without 
riding it. Right now the ride costs $6.50 per adult, but the 
prices are subject to change. If you want a closer look without 
getting wet, take a helicopter ride over the Falls. It's only $25 
per person, and the helicopters have turbine engines, which 
make them a little quieter than usual.
The American side of the Falls has an aquarium, an artists' 
market and gallery, and a museum of Native American art. The 
Aquarium of Niagara Falls has over forty exhibits, and the 
Artisans' Alley exhibits and sells the work of more than six 
hundred American craftsmen and artists. The Native American 
Center for the Living Arts, also known as "The Turtle," spon­
sors Native American craft shows and plays in addition to the 
Native American art collections in the gallery.
The Canadian side of the Falls has another aquarium, the 
Minolta and Skylon Towers, and lots of museums. Marineland, 
an aquarium which resembles Sea World more than you might 
expect, is open all year long, although the shows are seasonal. 
The Minolta and Skylon Towers offer an excellent view of the 
Falls and the surrounding area. Among the museums are the 
Guinness World of Records, Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum, 
Tussaud's Wax Museum and — hold your breath — the new 
Elvis Presley museum.
As the saying goes, the best place to stay in New York is 
with a friend. It's intended for people traveling to New York 
City, but it's easily applicable here. Whether you stay on the 
American or Canadian side of the Falls, expect to pay tourist- 
oriented prices at the local hotels. Besides, you're bound to 
spend more of your time in nearby Buffalo and Toronto.

If you'd like to "shop til you drop" at bargain basement 
prices and catch a bit of history while you're at it, then Reading 
(pronounced "Red-ing") is the place for you.
An Outlet Haven
Nestled in Eastern Pennsylvania in Berks County, the city 
of Reading is "the outlet capital of the world." With over 250 
outlet stores ranging from fashions to furniture, cosmetics to 
tableware, Reading is sure to satisfy the needs of everyone from 
the average shopper to the shopping connoisseur.
The outlet stores located throughout the city can be a 
shopper's paradise, but be warned that not all of the merchan­
dise is first quality. Some of the merchandise might be slightly 
irregular but with careful inspection, you can get unbelievable 
bargains. Brand names run rampant throughout the outlets and 
discounts can go as high as 80 percent. And remember, there's 
no tax on clothes in Pennsylvania.
The Reading Outlet Center, located at 801 North 9th Street, 
is the largest outlet center, with over 70 individual stores 
housed in several buildings within two blocks. There you'll 
find such brand names as Jaeger, Liz Claiborne, London Fog, 
Polo/Ralph Lauren, and Levi Strauss. It's open on Fridays and 
Saturdays from 9 am to 6 pm, on Sundays from noon to 5 pm, 
and on Mondays from 9 am to 6 pm.
On the northern edge of Reading, you'll find Heisters Lane 
Complex, 800 Heisters Lane, Kutztown Road. This ten-outlet 
center within three buildings features Talbott, Mikasa, 
Burlington Coat and an All-in-One Linen outlet including 
Fieldcrest, Cannon, Springmaid, and Laura Ashley. The com­
plex is open on Fridays and Saturdays from 9 am to 8 pm, on 
Sundays from 11 am to 5 pm, and on Mondays from 9:30 am 
until 5 pm.
The oldest complex is the VF Factory Outlet Complex, 
located on Hill Avenue and Park Road in the Wyomissing area. 
Housed in eight buildings are 40 outlet stores including Lee 
Jeans, L.L. Bean, Vanity Fair lingerie, Totes, and Windsor shirts. 
The VF Factory Outlet Complex is open on Fridays from 9 am 
to 9 pm, on Saturdays from 9 am to 6 pm, on Sundays from 
noon to 5 pm, and on Mondays from 9 am until 9 pm.
Historical Reading
If shopping is not one of your personal favorites, then 
don't worry. There's more to Reading than just outlets. You can 
take a stroll through the core of downtown, Penn Square. 
Reading's first courthouse and the original farmers' market 
stood in Penn Square; thus, originally named Market Square.
Its current name comes from the men who laid out the city in 
1748, founders Thomas and Richard Penn. Today, Penn Square 
is the center of Reading's historical district where you can 
study original Victorian storefronts and 19th century workers' 
homes and commercial structures. A self-guided walking tour 
is available for free from the Berks County Visitors Information 
Association.
Remember the legendary frontiersman Daniel Boone? Well, 
you can visit the Daniel Boone Homestead, where he was born 
in 1734 and lived until 1750. The Homestead gives visitors a 
taste of 18th century farm furniture and a chance to view 
Daniel Boone's memorabilia. It includes a sawmill, barn picnic 
areas, nature trails, and a lake, all on 579 acres of land. It's 
located on Daniel Boone Road, Birdsboro, off Route 422. It's 
open on Fridays and Saturdays from 9 am to 5 pm; and on 
Sundays from noon to 5 pm. Admission is free but a guided 
tour through the house is $1.50.
After visiting the Daniel Boone Homestead, go back in time 
and get a view of Pennsylvania's countryside by riding the Blue 
Mountain and Reading Railroad. On a steam-era locomotive, 
you can travel an hour and a half over 26 miles between South 
Hamburg and Temple, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania
How TO GET there:
To get to Reading, simply take the 
Pennsylvania Turnpike east to 1-176

countryside is particularly 
beautiful now with the turning 
fall leaves. You can board the 
train at either South Hamburg 
Station, which is situated on 
Route 61 one mile south of Exit 
9A off Interstate 78, or Temple 
Station, which is located two 
miles north of Reading on 
Tuckerton Road between Routes 
61 and 222. Call the Blue Moun­
tain and Reading Railroad for a 
list of departure times.
For a panoramic view of Reading, go up to the summit of 
Mount Penn to the Pagoda. The Pagoda, on Duryea Drive and 
Skyline Boulevard, is a seven story Japanese-style tower. The 
610 foot Pagoda was built of red brick and tile in 1908 by a local 
businessman, William Witman. The Pagoda houses an authen­
tic 1739 temple bell from Obama, Japan and is the only Japa­
nese pagoda east of California. Additional features include a 
collection of Japanese cherry trees, an Oriental bridge and a 
bonsai island. This unique feature of Reading is open everyday 
from noon to 9 pm and admission is only a quarter.
Finally, if you're not worn out from the day, try some of 
Reading's cultural activities. Perhaps an opera at Berks County 
Opera will soothe those tired feet. Not interested in opera?
Well, you can sing along with the Reading Civic Opera Society 
as they entertain you with a musical. Contact the Berks County 
Visitors Association for more information.
For maps and travel data about Reading, outlet shopping, 
and other attractions of the area, contact: The Berks County 
Visitors Information Association, Sheraton Berkshire, Route 422 
West, Paper Mill Road Exit, Wyomissing, PA 19610 or call (215) 
375-4085 during the hours of 9 am to 5 pm on Mondays 
through Fridays; and 9 am to 1 pm on Saturdays.

It may not be skiing season yet, but you can still go to Seven 
Springs, Pennsylvania. It isn't a very long ride.
Grab a friend or significant other and, for $308, get a double room 
for two nights. Two breakfasts and one buffet dinner are also included. 
In addition, you get free roam of the indoor pool, health spa, racquet- 
ball, and tennis facilities.

range, and a miniture golf course. It also offers organized events such 
as hiking and nature walks. Finally, it DOES have a bar for those over 
21 where you can hang out, eat, drink, and be merry.
In October and November only, it has Autumn Fest Sundays.

BURG
Gettysburg is the prescription for those looking to escape 
the chaos of classes and the noise of Pittsburgh. This small 
Pennsylvanian town is tucked into fields made famous by the 
Civil War.
Mid-semester break is the perfect time to go because it falls 
on one of the two weekends of the Apple Harvest. The town 
springs to life with a huge craft show. You can buy crafts hand 
made by local artisans. And, of course, you can buy apples. 
Apple cider, apple pie and other apple goodies, buckets, even 
bushels, of apples.
Even if the Apple Harvest keeps you busy, find time to take 
a tour of the battlefields. I highly recommend doing it on 
horseback. Historical horseback riding tours are outrageously 
overpriced at $60 a ride, but they give a detailed description of 
what happened in the fields as you ride through them. How­
ever, a simple ride through the battlefields is only $15 and well 
worth it. If you get lucky, like I did, your guide might tell your 
group the civil war stories anyway. By October, the weather 
might be touch and go, but, if you catch a nice day it's worth it.
You can also take a two hour bus tour of the battlefields for 
$9.75. Gettysburg Tour Center runs these throughout the day 
and their number is (717) 334-6296.
If you don't want to be quite that touristy, the National 
Park Service give tourists two options. You can stop by and 
pick up a free map guide with the highlights of the battlefields. 
Some of these include, Little Round Top/Big Round Top and 
the National Cemetery on the south side of town and the Peace 
Light Memorial, located on the other side of town, north of 
Gettysburg College.
Another way to see the battlefields is to hire a historical 
guide who will sit with you in your car and tell you about the 
fields as you drive through them. This costs $17 per car. For 
more information, call (717) 334 1124.
Among the museums that dot the town are a civil war wax 
museum and several war hospitals that have been converted. 
On the outskirts of Gettysburg you'll find Eisenhower's farm, 
the farm house he lived in after his presidency.
For some good food at the end of the day, try the Ginger­
bread man on Steinweir Ave. It's a 
casual Bennigan's type place. 
Right down the road is the 
slightly more expensive Dobbin 
House. This converted farm house 
used to be home to Reverend 
Dobbin. The Reverend helped out 
many a runaway slave. The Plaza 
and J.D.'s Pub are two more 
casual places to eat, located in the 
center circle of town.
Everything in Gettysburg is 
easy enough to find; simply drive 
to the center of town and look for 
signs. It's not that big a place.

"What?" cries the collective. "Isn't CMU roughing it 
enough already?" Seriously, camping is a good way to recharge 
yourself and get ready for coming back and facing the rest of 
the semester. A few days of sleeping out in the open, cooking 
food over a fire, and staring at trees, can definitely offer you a 
new perspective.
Don't let roughing it scare you away; the campgrounds 
listed here offer campers some of the basic necessities that 
simply sleeping in the woods can't offer. The following 
campgrounda are all under two hours driving distance from 
Pittsburgh.
Bear Run Campgrounds: The campgrounds have hiking 
trails, biking trails, fishing, a heated pool, a recreation hall, and 
canoe rentals. That should be plenty to keep campers busy.
Bear Run closes at the end of October and reopens in mid- 
April. The cost is $12 a night for two people who are tenting; 
with an electric hookup, it is $4 extra for each person. They also 
have cabins; four adults with electricity and water would pay 
$35. To save a spot, Bear Run likes campers to make reserva­
tions at least a week ahead of time. For further information, call 
368-3564.
Five Pines Camping and Recreation: Throughout the 300 
acres of the park are hiking and bike trails. The campgrounds 
are also located near a lake where trout fishing is popular. The
campgrounds have hot showers and hot and cold running 
water. You can even arrange to have firewood delivered to 
your campsite. Five Pines closes in October. It's $6 per person a 
night. Electricity is extra. Five Pines likes to have reservations 
30 days in advance, if something unforeseen happens, like a 
blizzard on the day you had your reservations, they will give 
you a refund. For further information, call 329-4606.
Fox Den Acres: Fox Den facilities have showers, along with 
hot and cold running water. Fox Den Acres has hiking and bike 
trails. Fox Den closes November 1 and opens again on the first 
of May. A complete hookup is $15 for two people, while tenting 
for two people is $12 a night. You usually don't need to make 
reservations, unless you are planning to come up during a 
holiday, for which they recommend making reservations 30 
days in advance. For further information, call 925-7054.
Rose Point Park: The camp is located near Slippery Rock, 
and has, in addition to its many biking and hiking trails, white 
water rafting. It also has a recreation hall with a pool table and 
pinball machines. From time to time, it has special presenta­
tions. Rose Point also has showers, hot and cold running water, 
and is open year round. Tenting is $9 for two adults. Reserva­
tions usually need to be made a week in advance. For further 
information, call 924-2415.

There's an alternative to Architect's Leap, and while it's not 
as convenient, it's much more pleasant. It's not just for survi­
vors of the Architecture program, either — the visit is enjoyable 
for students of all majors. It's one of America's most famous 
architectural museums and is only an hour away from Pitts­
burgh; its mountain location makes for a relaxing day. The 
dream destination is Fallingwater.
Fallingwater was designed in 1936 by Frank Lloyd Wright, 
one of the greatest American architects of this century, as a 
home for the Kaufmann family of Pittsburgh (as in Kaufmann's 
Department Store). Members of the family lived in the home 
intermittently until a few years ago, when they generously 
donated it to the public.
Taking a tour of Fallingwater is a bit different from what 
you might expect. There are no velvet cords or plastic cases as 
in many museums, so it's like walking through someone's 
house. But what a house! It's famous because Frank Lloyd 
Wright designed it to fit harmoniously into the mountain and 
forest surroundings. It is built of mountain rock excavated 
nearby, which blends with the natural stone. But 
Fallingwater's most unusual feature is that it's built above a 
stream. Steps lead from the living room directly down to the 
water, which soon after tumbles over a waterfall.
Other unique features of the house are floors cut directly 
from the rock, and strangely enough, no curtains, even in the 
bathrooms. (Wright apparently thought that curtains were 
unnatural, and since there are no neighbors for miles around 
the heavily-wooded estate, he convinced the Kaufmanns to do 
without them.)
Fallingwater is south-east of Pittsburgh, near Ohiopyle. It's 
open from Tuesday through Sunday, 10 am to 4 pm until mid- 
November. Reservations are advised. To make them, or to get 
directions from CMU, call 329-8501. And if for some reason 
you can't get away but you want to enjoy the spirit of Frank 
Lloyd Wright, there are some lovely original Wright designs in 
the Architectural Archives of Hunt Library.

Most of us have been intrigued by white water rafting at 
some time or another, but few have actually gone out to brave 
the rapids. Well, you no longer have an excuse not to go, * 
because as Chris at Wild Water Unlimited says, "It's safer than 
driving a car." Experienced guides lead each group and pro­
vide all the necessary safety equipment at this rafting run 
located in Thurmond, West Virginia.
All the happy rafter has to bring is his or her personal gear 
which should include something that stays warm when wet.
Believe it or not, this does exist. Clothing made from wool and 
polyzorbane does the trick. You don't even have to be a swim­
mer, as long as you're not deathly afraid of water. On the other 
hand, being afraid of twenty foot waves is permissible.
If you can handle the thought of the waves, you'll 
definitely be able to deal with the price. There are a couple of 
different packages to choose from a one-day trip for $80 to a 
two-day trip for $200. There are five different group levels to 
choose from.
On a typical Saturday, about 140 people raft down the river 
and are bused back up to their cars. The overwhelming consen­
sus of the rapid riders is that nothing beats a natural roller 
coaster. For more information, call Wild Water Unlimited at 
(304) 555-1212.

You roll down your car window to let the aromatic scent of 
pure milk chocolate waft in and taunt your senses. You park by 
a chocolate kiss lamppost and are greeted by giant, smiling 
chocolate candies that lead you into a large, chocolate-colored 
building. Are you dreaming? No, you've simply just arrived at 
your very first stop in Chocolate Town, U.S.A., the Hershey 
Chocolate World visitors center in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
When you first arrive at the visitor's center, which is free 
and open daily from 9 am to 4:45 pm, sit back, relax, and enjoy 
a trolley ride through the Chocolate World's simulated choco­
late factory tour, which lets you experience the complete 
chocolate-making process, from the cocoa bean to the finished 
product. Chocolate World trolley tours run hourly on the 
weekends, and tickets can be purchased at the visitor's desk.
After taking a trip through the wonderful world of choco­
late-making, you may want to plan your day over breakfast or 
lunch at the Hershey's Cafe Restaurant, finishing it off with a 
bit of indulgence at the Chocolate Fantasy Dessert Bar. Then, if 
you wish, do some souvenir shopping at any of the ten Choco­
late World shops. Next, make sure you purchase tickets, ask for 
directions, make reservations, and do anything else you need to 
do at the visitor's desk. At last, you're ready to start your 
exiting day or weekend seeing the sights of Hershey.
For botanical enthusiasts, Hershey Gardens offers a splen­
did display of flowers, trees, and shrubs. In addition to the 
year-round display of hollies, Japanese maples, giant sequoias, 
and theme gardens, October offers a seasonal display of late- 
season rose bloom and chrysanthemums. Hershey Gardens is 
open daily 9 am to 5 pm; admission is $3.50 for visitors over 18 
and $1 for visitors 18 and under.
For those who would rather explore the deep realms of 
underground caverns, Indian Echo Caverns is for you. Learn 
about the history of explorers who first found their way 
through these passages, as you enjoy a 45-minute guided tour 
through the world of stalagmites, stalactites, columns, flow- 
stone, and lakes. Your tour is made comfortable with electri­
cally-lit, level pathways and stairs. Indian Echo Caverns is open 
daily, 10 am-4 pm; admission is $6. Directions to the caverns are 
simple: Take Route 322 West to Hummelstown/Middletown 
exit and follow the signs. The caverns are four miles from 
Hershey.
How TO GET THERE:
Take the Pennsylvania Turnpike east to Route 322, 
also heading east. The signs for Hershey are really 
hard to miss.
4- HOURS FROM PITTSBURGH
If exploring the deep realms of underground caverns just 
isn't for you, perhaps exploring the realms of history is more to 
your liking. Just a short walk from the Chocolate World 
visitor's center, the Hershey Museum of American Life offers a 
look into Hershey's rich heritage and America's illustrious past. 
A multitude of exhibits, which include antique furniture, china, 
musical instruments, native American artifacts, and even Mr. 
Hershey's search for a successful chocolate formula, all can be 
found in the museum. Feeling juvenile? Go play in the 
Children's Area, complete with a life-size tepee that invites you 
to be an American Indian for a day (tell them you're very big 
for your age). The museum is open daily 10 am-5 pm; admission 
is $3.50 for visitors over 18 and $1.25 for visitors 18 and under.
Tired of being cooped up inside stuffy buildings with lots 
of people? Get out! Go visit animals in authentic, natural 
environments at ZooAmerica. Lunch with a gator, hang out 
with a chimp, or have a nice talk with a polar bear. Whatever 
your favorite beast, you're sure to find it at ZooAmerica, which 
has over 200 animals of 75 different species. ZooAmerica opens 
daily at 10 am; admission is $3.50.
Whether you feel like staying outdoors or are too cheap to 
stay at a hotel, Hershey Highmeadow Camp offers 260 camp­
sites on 55 open and shaded acres. A laundry, a grocery and 
supply store, and a game room are among the facilities avail­
able on the campgrounds. Rates are (daily, group of 4): no 
hookup-$19, electric-$20.50, electric and water-$21.25, and 
electricity/water/sewer-$23.75. Reservations are recom­
mended.

“I played soccer in high school and I didn’t 
want to give it up when I got here, but I didn’t 
have time for varsity,” says MCS junior 
Manuel Llinas. “So I joined intramural soccer. 
I love it.... It’s the only outlet I have for 
physical activity at this university.”
Sentiments like these are reflected by many 
of CMU’s IM sports participants. Dave 
Schwartz, an H&SS sophomore and another 
IM soccer player, “played in high school and 
in a club over the summer and basically just 
wanted to keep with it.”
CMU’s widespread and diversified intramu­
ral program provides members of the campus 
community with opportunities for continuing 
previous interests as well as developing new 
ones.
Earl Birdy, director of IM sports at CMU, 
along with assistant directors Mike 
Mastroianni and Julie Cunningham and the 
Intramural Board, plans 39 activities for 
students this year.
These activities, ranging from soccer to 
backgammon, are offered with the hope that, 
“everyone [will have] an opportunity to play 
and have fun at their own skill level,” says 
Birdy.
Four levels of competition are offered to 
participants. The highest, the majors, is the 
most competitive. Many of the players partici­
pated in varsity athletic programs in high 
school and, although they may not have time 
to play varsity here, want to keep playing.
The next level, intermediates, also plays 
competitively, but the skill level is not quite 
as high. The minors are, as Birdy says, “just 
for fun.” And the women’s league is, obviously 
enough, just for women. Each league has its 
own championship tournaments, and trophies 
are awarded to the winners.
The benefits of getting involved in IM sports 
are as many and varied as the sports them­
selves. Perhaps the biggest is the release of 
stress. Especially at a university like CMU, 
things can get pretty tense, and physical 
activity is a great way to unwind. “IM sports 
are great for tension release. One of the best 
study breaks is going to the gym to play 
volleyball,“ says H&SS senior Eric Hamilton.
Recreation is another perk of getting in­
volved with the IM program. “They [IM sports 
participants] eat better, sleep better, become 
better, more well-rounded people by having 
some sort of physical activity they can enjoy,” 
says Birdy.
Intramural sports are also one of the few 
ways in which students can meet students
iaa uocKstaaer/ lartan Photo Editor 
cAPVEe meaPAyp A *VPasR aP cCvp Hseby iAu. [A7ab 
?aPafp A yEPasR aP cCvo
from other colleges. In a school as segregated 
as CMU, meeting people with other interests 
may be difficult, but in the IM program, 
everyone competes directly with everyone else, 
no matter what school or profession. “It’s one of 
the few things at this school which brings 
people together. It doesn’t matter if you’re an 
engineer or an English major — everyone can 
play, and that’s really cool,” says MCS senior 
Amy Shalikashvili.
Whatever their reasons, though, students 
continue to fill up the IM rosters semester 
after semester. Seventeen participation records 
were set last year, and, in the first month of 
the new academic year, three of those have 
already been broken. In all sports, participa­
tion totalled 3,965 individuals, many of whom 
played more than one sport.
The success of CMU’s intramural program is 
unheard of in schools of 6,000 students. Birdy 
says, “We had 106 basketball teams. Other 
schools our size have 65 or 70.”
Intramural sports in season include soccer, 
touch football, co-rec volleyball, and tennis. 
Although a few sports seasons have already 
ended, many are coming up within the next 
few weeks. Check with the IM department for 
entry deadlines and requirements. Teams are 
required for most of the activities, although in 
some, like wrestling and swimming, partici­
pants compete individually.
IM sports offer good, clean, sane fun for the 
overworked, overstressed community of 
Carnegie Mellon. If you think the intramural 
program sounds like something you’d like to get 
involved with, call Birdy at the intramural 
office at x2214 for more details.

Andrew Carnegie may have 
been responsible for the first 
billion dollar business, philan­
thropic endeavors, and a techni­
cal school, but much of his 
success can be attributed to a 
man by the name of Henry Clay 
Frick.
Frick made his millions from 
coke—burnt coal, not the 
drug—which became enough 
incentive for Frick to purchase 
the beautiful Clayton mansion 
in 1882 on what used to be the 
outskirts of Pittsburgh.
Today, the massive house that 
sits on the corner of Penn and 
Homewood Avenues in Point 
Breeze may look like another 
Victorian mansion of 
Pittsburgh’s bygone era. But it 
is more than that.
The Clayton house stands as 
one of the most extensive 
restoration projects in the city, 
and a symbol of the immense 
wealth that dominated the city.
Although it was purchased for 
an unimaginable $25,000 in 
1882, it has taken $6 million to 
restore the enormous 23-roomed 
Italianate house. The house, 
which was built in the 1860s, 
has endured, but its legacy 
supersedes.
Interior decorations began 
immediately after the purchase, 
and the house was enlarged in 
1891 to its present size. Frick 
and his wife, Adelaide, became 
avid art collectors, acquiring 
exquisite works from the likes 
of Claude Monet and Childe 
Hassam. Numerous other pieces 
adorn the first and second 
floors.
The Frick’s accumulated quite 
a collection of horse-drawn 
carriages as well, which re­
mains as one of the finest 
collections in the nation.
But all this wealth and

young steel entrepreneurs, 
namely Carnegie, during the 
1870s and 80s.
By the age of 31, Frick was a 
millionaire. Carnegie recruited 
Frick’s shrewd talents by 
making him chairman of the 
board of the Carnegie Steel 
Company in 1892 —just in time 
for the heralded Homestead 
Steel Strike.
The crisis pitted striking 
workers locked out of Carnegie’s 
plant against Pinkerton detec­
tives who were ordered by Frick 
himself to break the strike. 
(Carnegie was vacationing in 
Scotland at the time). A wall 
constructed around the plant, 
dubbed “Fort Frick” by the 
townspeople, became a symbol 
of management’s isolation from 
the union.
In labor circles, Frick became 
infamous for the wealth he 
acquired at the expense of many 
workers who died for his busi­
ness.
Still, to the wealthy commu­
nity of Pittsburgh, the Frick 
family represented high society 
at the turn of the century.
Guests at Clayton Mansion 
included Carnegie, Andrew 
Mellon, Henry Phipps, and the 
illustrious former president 
Teddy Roosevelt.
By 1900, Pittsburgh was 
awash with millionaires. A 
multitude of mansions graced 
the city, many outsizing 
Clayton.
Yet the Frick family found 
New York City a much more 
palatable city to display their 
wealth.
They left Clayton in 1905 for 
larger houses, returning only 
occasionally for holidays. Frick’s 
larger estates, one on New York 
City's Fifth Avenue, and 
another, a 104-room giant called 
Eagle Rock, in Pride’s Crossing, 
Massachusetts, became their 
more frequent habitations. 
However, Frick’s daughter, 
Helen Clay Frick, returned to 
Clayton in 1981, loyal to her 
fond memories of childhood.
Helen Clay Frick inherited 
$38 million from her father at 
the time of his death in 1919. 
Although it was many years 
before she moved back to 
Clayton from her home in 
Bedford, Mass., she remained a 
resident of Pittsburgh.
Helen Frick never married; 
rather, she became steadfast to 
the estate. She created the 
Frick Art Museum on the 
grounds in 1970. Her interests 
in historic preservation were 
articulated in a desire to exhibit
the house as a museum after 
she died.
Now, through meticulous 
care, painstaking restoration, 
and millions of dollars, this has10 
become reality.
The interior has been restored1 
to resemble the originality of 
the early 1900s. Many of the 
12,000-plus objects found in the 
house are on display as Helen 
Frick left them, including more 
than 3,000 articles of clothing.
With personal items placed 
about the house, in the bed­
room, and the much talked 
about library, it looks as if the 
Fricks have returned.
The L-shaped library is the 
pride of Clayton. The dimly lit 
room is a cozy study for quiet 
thinking. Frick entertained 
many of his guests in this room;
In the bedroom, a portrait of 
Henry Clay himself rests over ¦ 
the mantle. The dining room 
stops short of a castle dining 
hall. The thick, majestic table 
awaits a small party of ten. A 
massive 11-foot high 19 th 
century painting, “Consolatrix 
Afflictorum,” by P. A. J. 
Dagnan-Bouveret, envelops a 
whole wall, as Madonna and 
Child watch over the house.
The exterior is equally re­
markable. The once-faded brick 
now gleams with newness. An 
elaborate porte-cochere (a 
covered carriage entrance) dates 
back to Clayton’s first years and 
has retained its originality. The 
rounded windows follow the 
curvature of the brick instead of 
sharp corners.
Clayton’s smooth flowing 
design is uninterrupted by its 
huge yard surrounded with a 
black iron fence. The green­
house and carriage house keep 
the mansion company on its 
grounds.
It is sad, however, to see 
Clayton alone on its manicured 
plot of land. When Helen Clay 
Frick died in 1984 at the age of 
96, she took with her the 
memories of Pittsburgh’s 
splendor.
Clayton represents an era of 
wealthy landowners who made 
their millions from the mass- 
industrialization and rapid 
expansion of Pittsburgh typi­
cally characterized by its 
“smoky city” image.
But we cannot forget those 
men who toiled in the steel 
mills and coal mines, fought 
strikebreakers, and created the 
backbone of America to let 
people like Henry Clay Frick 
own a slice of splendor like 
Clayton.

perception of Persian Gulf 
¡crisis distorted by prejudice
Jjgy TRUPTI PATEL
tyartan Asst. Features Editor
'Leave your prejudices and your pre­
conceived ideas outside the door.” These 
wëre the words of Bill Breslove, a 
Carnegie Mellon graduate student, as he 
commenced a discussion about the cur­
rent Persian Gulf Crisis. The open forum 
type lecture took place on Thursday af­
ternoon at 4:30 in Baker Hall 254A.
Breslove’s goals were to answer ques­
tions of both students and professors 
jjbout the current situation and to relate 
!jto the audience some of his conclusions 
^bout the Persian Gulf Crisis. Since 
fereslove is currently completing his 
loctoral dissertation on the topic of the 
nodem Middle East, he is both well 
•esearched and well informed on the 
lubject. In fact, the graduate student 
jas been studying the Middle East since 
.966.
However, Breslove’s main concern was 
that all the participants leave their 
jrejudices about the Middle East behind 
;hem in order to gain a full understanding 
and appreciation for the situation in that 
prea of the world. He opened his discus­
sion by stating quite frankly, “The Middle 
East is not some mad house half-way 
around the world. I hope that I do not
Wonder Woman’s beau discusses male impotence on late night TV
In the stupor which often ac- 
dompanies late-night television 
viewing, seemingly incongruent 
things come together into a rela­
tively upsetting whole.
Consider advertising. Natu­
rally, the purpose of the adver­
tiser is to get the consumer to 
believe that the product being 
Mwked on the screen is absolutely 
necessary for the viewer to lead a 
well-balanced existence. Nothing 
new here.
However, what happens when, 
at five in the morning, fifty percent 
of cable channels are showing half-
bring any political bias with me, but I 
can assure you that everyone of us brings 
some cultural bias in here with us.” 
Pertinent examples of cultural bias 
are that most Americans consider Iraq to 
be an extremely hostile nation with a 
very large military, a primarily Arab 
population, and a large Muslim nation. 
Bias comes into play when Americans 
assume the opposite: that Iraq is a nation 
with a military and a population of 
Muslim Arabs and is, therefore, very 
hostile. These are assumptions based on 
both ignorance and ethnocentrism.
Ethnocentrism, as Breslove related it, 
was a big factor in influencing the 
American public’s views of the Middle 
East. And ethnocentrism is often origi­
nated and perpetuated by that bastion of 
truth, the American mass media. Says 
Breslove, “The American public trusts 
Dan Rather — why? We think we’re 
getting the truth, the whole story over 
here and those poor people in Iraq are 
getting all the lies. But are we getting 
the truth? Maybe they’re just telling us 
what they want to tell us.”
Breslove concluded from this that “... 
truth is not the lifeblood of politics.” He 
went on to illustrate this point by exam­
ining both George Bush and Saddam

hour-long commercials for 
Soloflex or Weight-Mate (Weight- 
Mare? Cruci-Flex?) and the other 
fifty percent are showing half- 
hour long commercials for a build- 
your-own-self-esteem course?
It doesn’t take a rocket scientist 
to figure out the snafu this puts 
the average Highlander-fed 
viewer in. To watch a man with 
chafing-dish sized pectorals flex­
ing for a half-hour can have one of 
two possible effects at five in the 
morning.
One, the desired effect, of hav­
ing the viewer reach for the tele­
phone and order a Weight-Mare 
machine. Two, having the viewer, 
his self-esteem crushed by the 
comparison of the Television 
Model’s Weight-Mare-Condi- 
tioned-Physique with his own
Body-By-Pillsbury configuration, 
flip the channel and find himself 
hit in the face with a program 
which claims to solve the self­
esteem problem with a course 
consisting of twenty audiocas­
settes which will motivate the 
viewer to improve himself, pre­
sumably by purchasing a Weight- 
Mare machine.
The problem with all late-night 
television advertising is that it 
presents a challenge to every no­
tion of manliness taught to the 
average male.
The television program Amaz­
ing Discoveries is a perfect ex­
ample of this challenge to all no­
tions of male virility. Amazing 
Discoveries is a mock half-hour 
long talk-show in which special 
guests are brought in, often from 
exotic countries, in order to dem­
onstrate amazing products which 
cannot be found in the States.
The version of the show cur­
rently getting the most airplay 
consists of an emaciated En­
glishman demonstrating how his 
product (called “Astonish”) can 
clean even the toughest stains.
In order to demonstrate, the
largest man from the audience is 
called out on stage along with an 
average housewife type. Both are 
placed in front of twin baking 
pans, covered with grease which 
has been burned onto them with a 
welding torch (this is a problem in 
many a home).
The man stands about twelve 
feet tall, has kielbasa-shaped 
forearms and great tufts of hair 
sticking out from the front and 
back of his shirt collar.

Person's Opinion
Recently, Carnegie Mellon’s 
administration has asked for 
your opinions on the new Uni­
versity Center.
Specifically, what should be 
there? A national food chain, a 
running track, an auditorium, 
or perhaps another Andrew 
cluster?
How about a pet store or a 
fruit stand? Or even a place 
where you can eat without rup­
turing vital organs?
Opinions vary widely. Ideally, 
the new center would retain all 
the functionality ofSkibo while 
adding new facilities like these.
This week, The Tartan asked 
students, “What facilities would 
you want to see included in the 
new University Center?n
Donna Lynn Yu 
Freshman, CFA
“A theater would be nice. So 
would a health food store where 
you can get granola without

Banana yellow Fords and barbershops are a good combination
If you’re ever by chance on the 
way into Paul Doyle’s Barber 
Shop, looking for a shampoo or 
body wave, and the red and blue 
striped pole outside goes by un­
noticed, it won’t be long before 
Paul will flat out tell you himself 
that “this ain’t no salon.”
. Paul Doyle’s Barber Shop, lo­
cated on East Ohio Street in the 
North Side, is far from being a 
salon. The place is simply one of 
a dying breed of hair cutting es­
tablishments that still cling to 
the ‘shave and a haircut’ philoso­
phy. Isn’t anyone tired of walking 
into those styling joints, only to 
watch a gum-snapping girl named 
Trish, to the tune of about twenty- 
five bucks, mold your hair into 
into the shape of a wild mush­
room?
¦ When are people going to real­
ize that only six or seven hairs 
actually end up getting cut at 
those places? Sure it looks a little 
shorter when Trish is done; that’s 
what the wind tunnel and stamp

glue were for. What a racket!
Go ahead, ask Paul Doyle if he’s 
got any mousse. Paul might pro­
ceed to tell you about the one 
hanging over the mantle in his 
den, but aside from that, the word 
has no meaning in his business. 
Tonic? Definitely. But mousse? 
Never. However, there’s more 
than hair to consider here.
For just $5.00 ($4.00 for kids), a 
customer of Paul Doyle not only 
receives a great haircut, but from 
the time of arrival he can shoot 
the breeze with some of the true 
unsung heroes of the entertain­
ment business.
When I took my first step into 
the small shop I felt as if I had 
entered a sacred shrine. The dark 
stained furniture, Norman 
Rockwell prints, sports para­
phernalia, and old photographs 
all combined with the soothing 
smell of talc to create a generally 
warm and relaxed atmosphere.
As I seated myself next to a 
gentleman much my senior, I 
immediately respected him for the 
nice lid which was perched on his 
head. After listening to Paul and 
this gentleman shout back and 
forth about the weather for a 
while, I noticed that four out of 
five people who walked by the 
window outside looked in and 
waved. It was then that I felt 
compelled to ask Paul just how 
long he has been in business. With 
the delivery of a well- trained 
comic, Paul held his clippers in 
the air and answered, “Too long. 
Thirty- three years. After 35 they 
come in and take you away in a 
tuxedo.”

Paul then looked at his watch atifl 
with a big grin on his face, turned 
to me and said, “There’s the ‘Go'd- 
father’ in his aircraft carrier, right 
on time as usual.”
Of course I was the only one 
who didn’t know what Paul was 
talking about. It turned out that 
these guys, most of whom are 
retired, gather here at the same 
time each day to talk things over 
among themselves and chew the 
fat with the customers.
So in walked Sam, fresh from 
his aircraft carrier, and holding a 
plastic shopping bag on his arm, 
As soon as the initial greetings 
were through, Sam took his spot 
by the window, periodically 
chiming in to let everyone kn6ty 
what was on his mind.
These guys didn’t mess around. 
We talked sports, politics and a 
few other topics which will go 
unmentioned. I began to consider 
coming to Paul Doyle’s every day 
myself.
Paul doesn’t rush through'4 
haircut; his flurries of clipping^ 
are evenly punctuated by some of 
the finest stories that 33 years in 
the business can produce. Pick a 
topic. Fights: he hit him like a 
damn oak tree, lifted him 3 feet off 
the ground, and when the guy 
come down he was snoring. Booze: 
a belt of that stuff will knock you 
out cold.
High school memories: this was 
a high school of 139, and this \ 
team right here, this one (point­
ing to picture), went 3 years 
undefeated.
Each time Paul puts down hi$ 
scissors and faces the audiendej 
you can be sure a gem is about't’6 
unfold. “I got enough stories on 
one guy (customer) alone to write 
a book.” And Sam will be the first 
to assure you that every one of 
them is true. But why believe 
Sam? Paul will tell you himself:
“These are all real stories. J 
don’t have the imagination t(j 
bullshit you boys.” I hadn’t even 
gotten my haircut yet, and if I had 
left at that moment, my five dol-1 
lars would have been well-spenti
As I climbed into the chair, Sam 
looked at his watch and decided 
he had better be going. “I’ll see yd 
there Paul, meanwhile you boys 
take care.” Before I knew it, thd 
gleaming yellow aircraft carrieij 
was gliding up the street and out 
of sight. They don’t make ‘em like 
that anymore.
While Paul snipped away hej 
told me all about a picture, of hin^ 
cutting a kid’s hair, which for 
while hung in a museum (shown 
above). The picture was taken by! 
a photographer named Sallyi 
Maxson, and although I was im­
pressed by Paul’s days in the 
limelight, he was pretty modest 
about the whole thing.
“She had that thing, it must; 
have been four foot by five foot, in 
the C&G building. Guys were1 
telling me, come and look at you’re 
picture, come and look at you’re 
picture. I tell them, what the hell, 
I can look in the mirror and see 
the same thing.” He was right. I 
had no argument.
After Paul finished vacuuming 
my head, he waited for my api 
proval so that he could then begin 
the finishing touches. A swift 
brush of talc around the neck area; 
and slow spin in the chair for 
final check of approval in th^ 
mirror, which can only take place 
after the cloud of talc rises above 
the customer’s newly trimmed 
head.
Words alone are no vehicle on 
which a person should ever full)’ 
rely as a substitute for actually 
experiencing Paul Doyle’s Bar-; 
bershop. So if ever on the Nortfy 
Side and in dire need of a haircut' 
that you don’t feel like taking a 
loan out to pay for, stop in and sa^ 
hello to Paul Doyle and company. 
Oh, and while you’re there, ask 
him to tell you about the guy with 
the eleven brain operations.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 1 October 1990L5
Grad student sees current situation in the Persian Gulf as a disaster
PREJUDICES, from page L3
'Hussein’s claims about Kuwait. Hussein 
claims that the US is only concerned 
¿bout Kuwait because of oil interests. In 
^addition, he believes that Kuwait is not 
a sovereign nation with its own borders, 
-but actually a country that was originally
# part of Iraq. On the other hand, Bush 
claims that Americans are in the Per­
sian Gulf to protect Democracy and the 
Jjorders of a sovereign nation.
Utilizing these examples, Breslove 
jxiaintained that in addition to the media, 
political figures also have a role in the
genesis of untruths concerning other ar­
eas of the world. “As with all political 
speeches, [Hussein and Bush’s words] 
are partly truth and partly fiction.”
As the situation stands right now, 
Breslove stated that one of two very 
general scenarios could take place be­
tween the United States and Iraq. The 
first is that Saddam Hussein, with his 
current missile capability, will attempt 
to invade Saudi Arabia due to his delu­
sions of power. Breslove quipped, 
“Saddam is definitely not a very intelli­
gent man, but he is very shrewd — so
there is something to fear.” In the first 
scenario, the US would allow Iraq to 
enter Saudi Arabia in order to get US 
troops on the Saudi Arabian desert for 
the first time.
According to Breslove, getting Ameri­
can troops into Saudi Arabia is an almost 
impossible task, and allowing Iraq to 
invade the desert sheikdom would be 
one of the easiest ways to achieve such a 
goal. In the second scenario, the US 
could initiate military tactics against 
Iraq—perhaps declaring war.
However, Breslove stated succinctly,
“If you ask me if I believe there will be a 
war, I don’t.” The reasons behind this 
stance are that “American troops will 
never be committed on Arab land be­
cause we have too many Arab allies. We 
don’t want to kill our fellow Arabs.”
In addition, Breslove cautioned that 
annihilating Iraqi power could be just as 
dangerous as allowing Iraqi power to 
grow.
The elimination of Iraq as a power in 
the Middle East would create a power 
vacuum which many nations in the un­
stable area, including Israel, might at­
tempt to take over. Even though 
Breslove, as a former United States Ma­
rine, understands military maneuvers, 
he believes that a cautious stance is 
perhaps the best.
Breslove concluded his forum by em­
phasizing the question now is not to 
determine who is at fault, but to try to 
resolve the situation in the most peace­
ful and efficient manner possible. He 
states simply but ominously, “This is a 
disaster — what is happening [in thé 
Persian Gulf], and we must treat it as 
such.”

iorm. The average-housewife type 
.is given a sponge which has been 
treated with “Astonish.”
The host, a “sensitive” type (you 
can tell because he is wearing a 
sweater) starts a timer, and faster 
tjian you can say “men are pigs” 
,£he average housewife type is 
standing by a clean baking pan 
while Magilla Gorilla is still try­
ing to figure out how the sponge 
came to have all of those holes in 
it. At this point the sensitive host 
Jqoks at the emaciated English­
man and exclaims “That’s pretty 
good!” whereupon the English­
man exclaims “Astonished?”
.Click, buzz.
On channel thirty-three is a 
show entitled Let’s Talk - With 
Lyle Waggoner in which Lyle (you 
remember Lyle, he used to be 
jviajor Steve Trevor in the old 
Wonder Woman T.V. show) plays 
|lje part of a sensitive talk-show 
host (though not too sensitive: he 
is, after all, a military man) who 
interviews men who have used 
and benefitted from a product 
called Y-Bron.
So far, so good, right?
Wrong.
. Y-Bron happens to be the 
piiracle cure for male impotence. 
But wait! Because before getting
to the glittering testimonials for 
the product (“After I took Y-Bron, 
I felt a man once more; food even 
started to taste better!”), Lyle in­
troduces several “physicians,” 
most of whom look like members 
of Jimmy The Greek’s entourage, 
who elaborate on the alternatives 
which impotent men have to 
drinking Y-Bron’s carefully 
blended mixture of herbs and 
spices.
By the time the guy in the plaid 
suit demonstrates the six-inch 
long fall insertion plastic extenda- 
prod which maintains the male in 
a constantly erect state and “ne­
cessitates the use of pleated pants 
on behalf of the patient” (at this 
point the camera cuts to the audi­
ence, comprised mostly of obese, 
middle aged men and their scowl­
ing wives, focusing on the intense 
amount of leg crossing going on) 
all I can think about is Lyle 
breaking entirely out of character 
and exclaiming “That’s pretty 
good!”
But wait! Don’t hold your 
breath! Because on channel 45, 
Alex Karras is busy proving the 
theory that with a fifteen video­
cassette course, any lunkhead ex­
football player can learn to play 
the piano!
Don’t touch that dial!
...the role of the advertiser is to get 
the consumer to believe that the 
product on the screen is absolutely 
necessary for the viewer to lead a 
well-balanced existence...
On three different channels, 
Robert Vaughn (who is anchoring 
a show supposedly called Discover: 
The World of Science), Bradford 
Dillman (this is the guy who needs 
the title “actor” superimposed 
under his name) and Joseph 
Campanella (host of that interna­
tionally acclaimed documentary 
program Looking Closer) all de­
cry the havoc that pattern bald­
ness can wreak to a man’s self 
esteem — one of the testimonials 
comes from a “journalist” who 
claims to have lost his creative 
ability when his hair began to fall 
out!
And wait! Isn’t that John Ritter 
talking about how bad grades can 
spoil a young man’s self esteem? 
And what’s that Englishman do­
ing behind the wok? You mean we 
are supposed to know how to cook? 
If that is so, why is it that the guy 
who is selling the motorized hand­
held blender which can make a
light-weight-lo-cal-fruity-dessert- 
that-rivals-yogurt-in-taste-but- 
has-none-of-the-fat-treat needs 
that woman to explain the prod­
uct to him?
Don’t answer yet, because on 
channel fifty-eight a “French” chef 
is demonstrating how to use the 
slicer/dicer/julianne machine, and 
he looks almost looks hermaphro­
ditic!
The onslaught does not end 
here, because the most blatant 
display is yet to come. After sev­
eral seconds of frenzied channel 
switching, I find my self watching 
Jimmy Woo’s promo for his real- 
estate-success method.
I am sure we are all familiar 
with the scam: one seeks “de­
pressed property,” meaning buy 
from people who are desperate to 
sell (widows, wives of jailed con­
victs, etc.) at a substantially lower 
price than asked and sell for profit.
Of course, one has to buy the
fifteen videocassette seminar; af­
ter all, we wouldn’t want anybody 
reading those obituaries improp­
erly, I mean, even Jimmy Woo 
has dying relatives, and I’m sure 
he wouldn’t want you to get to 
them before he does.
Thus far it only sounds slightly 
underhanded, until Jimmy him­
self appears on the screen. In or­
der to demonstrate himself as 
truly successful, Jimmy is con­
stantly surrounded by three or 
four large-breasted blondes in bi­
kinis.
By the time Jimmy makes his 
three piece-suited appearance in 
the executive suite of one of his 
buildings, the appearance of the 
three bikini-clad bombshells 
serving coffee by the credenza and 
smearing baby-oil on each other 
has taken a peculiar tone of 
surreality.
Of course, Jimmy is only prov­
ing that which every immigrant 
knows so well, that the only mea­
sure of success for a non-white 
man in America is the amount of 
white women he can hoard away 
from the white majority. In addi­
tion, Jimmy seems to be telling 
the public at large that “nice guys” 
simply do not get the opportunity 
to hang out with gorgeous blondes 
who wear bikinis.
By now, a pretty clear picture of 
what the average man should be 
begins to emerge from the elec- 
tron-stream of the TV screen.
He is tall, built like Jean-Claude 
van Damme, can remove baked- 
on stains with a blow-torch, is 
hung like a horse (at least a horse 
armed with a plastic extend-a- 
prod), can cook with a wok, slice,, 
dice, julianne, eat lo-cal-dessert 
treats, identify sponges, operate 
small kitchen appliances, clean 
small kitchen appliances, repair 
small kitchen appliances, and; 
demurely take advice on the op-; 
eration of small kitchen appli­
ances, has a lot of hair ( on his 
head, that is) plays the piano bet­
ter than the average football 
player, has gobs of self esteem, 
wears sweaters, compliments ev­
erybody, has an English accent, 
won’t lose his creativity, gets good 
grades and would gladly sell his 
grandparents down the river.
All in exchange for the com­
pany of four or five of the “aver­
age” women who appear in the 
commercials shown during the 
rest of the day.

DIVERSIONS
PBT principal dancer 
leaps into Swan Lake
Laura Desiree’s life revolves 
around a classical challenge
[F?' $’tvt'vXk
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Laura Desiree has lived a life of 
ballet.
She has matured from an eight- 
year-old girl being dragged off to 
Ijgllet class to a graceful ballerina 
i principal dancer at the 
ISttsburgh Ballet Theatre. This 
October, she makes her debut in 
one of the greatest classical bal­
lets, Swan Lake.
Seated in an office chair at PBT, 
Desiree is a slight figure in a blue 
sweater and jeans. She sits com­
fortably with her legs crossed 
under her. She glances at the floor, 
a smirk pulling at the comers of 
her mouth as she recalls that first, 
fateful day.
“I didn’t want to go!” She breaks 
into a full grin. “My two older 
sisters were taking ballet, and 
m^.mother thought I should too. I 
pigeon-toed, and she thought 
Pallet would help correct it. So 
stfe dragged me to class. Literally, 
icried and made a scene.
' “I didn’t want to go because my 
sisters were doing it. I didn’t want 
to be involved in everything that 
they did. I wanted my own iden­
tity.”
For a while, that identity turned 
into music. Desiree quit classes 
when she was about 11 to take 
piano lessons and become more 
involved in school. But within a 
year, Desiree found herself back 
in the studio.
“One of my sister’s friends made 
a rude comment about my 
knowledge of ballet — the lack of 
it. I wanted to show her what I 
could do, so I went back,” she said.
And the whirlwind followed. 
Desiree soon received a full 
scholarship to continue her 
training with Meredith Baylis at
Swan Lake is the biggest thing I’ve 
ever done. I'm trying to keep it in per­
spective — trying not to get too over­
whelmed.
— Laura Desiree
the Joffrey Ballet School.
“It was a very exciting time for 
me. I danced in the Joffrey Ballet 
Concert Group. I remember we 
did a three-month tour of Texas, 
and during the summers we’d go 
to Grand Rapids, Michigan and 
stay there for two months.... We 
did a lot of dancing.”
Desiree was quite successful at 
Joffrey Ballet. She danced many 
leading roles and created roles in 
two ballets choreographed for her 
by director James Snyder.
But after three years, “Joffrey 
wasn’t hiring me for the main 
company! I decided it was time to 
do some auditions.”
Desiree auditioned at various 
ballets throughout the country, 
including Boston Ballet and Pa­
cific Northwest. It was 1982 when 
she settled into her new home at 
PBT.
Desiree fondly recalls her first 
performance at PBT. “It was in 
Giselle,” she said. “I remember 
the director coming up to me af­
terwards and telling me I needed 
to smile more. And something 
about my lipstick.... He didn’t like 
the color!”
That didn’t prevent her from 
making great strides at PBT. 
Desiree was promoted to soloist 
in 1986 — quite a difference from 
the stalling she dealt with at 
Joffrey. But Desiree understands. 
“There are never any guaran-
Thomas Nichols/Tartan Senior Photographer 
3[EyaREE yNRa.Ey A zsyE bVRaPf NHE REHEARyAe sG 'ivt ,v2e LHaeE NHE 
3usUzAPd ess.y sPo
tees [of promotion]. It’s different 
for every person, for every ballet. 
It doesn’t matter how long you’ve 
been there.”
It didn’t take PBT long to rec­
ognize Desiree’s talent. By Janu­
ary of 1990, she had been pro­
moted to principal dancer.
This season at PBT, Desiree 
makes her debut in Swan Lake, 
one of the world’s most celebrated 
ballets. Desiree has been given 
the challenge of the dual role of 
Odette/Odile. Odette is the Swan 
Queen under Baron von 
Rothbart’s spell. She can only live 
in her true human form between 
the hours of dusk and dawn. Odile 
is the Black Swan, Odette’s evil 
double, the instrument of de­
struction. She attempts to seduce 
Prince Siegfried, whose love 
nearly destroys the woman he 
adores.
While current productions of 
Swan Lake will sometimes fea­
ture different dancers in the roles 
of Odette and Odile, it has become 
customary for one ballerina to 
perform the dual role. Not only is 
this a demand on the physical 
side of ballet, but a dancer must 
be able to convey the two distinct 
personalities.
“I haven’t taken any formal 
acting classes, but I have been 
coached in the role,” says Desiree. 
“It involves many dramatic de­
mands. I’m excited about the 
challenge.
“Swan Lake is the biggest thing 
I’ve ever done. I’m trying to keep 
it in perspective — trying not to 
get too overwhelmed.”
The rehearsal schedule alone is 
overwhelming enough. Not only 
has the company been preparing 
for Swan Lake, but all the other 
ballets set for the season, which 
will end around April.

Bloomquist when they danced 
together at Joffrey. Today he is a 
soloist at PBT.
“After I moved to Pittsburgh, 
Brian came and told the director 
that he wanted to work at this 
company. A contract opened up 
when a dancer decided to leave. It 
was offered to Brian, and we’ve 
been here ever since.
“We enjoy working together. 
We’re used to it. This summer, he 
was partnering another girl for a 
ballet competition. I didn’t see 
him for about a month.”
Desiree laughs, leaning back in 
the chair. ‘That was worse than 
any time we could spend working 
together. We’re not used to sepa­
ration. That’s what’s weird for 
us.”
“We take work home,” Desiree 
admits. “We have a full schedule 
and it’s hard not to bring it home. 
But we do get a break now and 
then.
“Just the other night I came 
home and Brian had on a tape of 
Count Basie’s Orchestra he’d just 
bought.” Desiree brightens at the 
memory, emphasizing with her 
hands. “It was great! We sat in
the living room for three hours 
listening to jazz. Then we put on 
Frank Sinatra. We just took a 
little time out.”
What’s the best way to escape 
from it all? “We go on vacation!” 
Desiree delights in the idea; it 
shows all over her face. “For a 
week or two we take some time for 
ourselves. We’ve been to the Car­
ibbean, to France ... we like to go 
sit in the sun somewhere and not 
move.”
It seems that Desiree doesn’t 
really mind the rigorous season 
and few-and-far-between breaks. 
Having the opportunity to dance 
is a fair trade for her. “I love 
performing with alive orchestra,” 
she says. “That’s my favorite thing 
to do. It’s a beautiful collabora­
tion between artists.
“I do feel a little stage fright 
sometimes, especially if I haven’t 
performed in a couple of weeks. 
But you just have to try to relax 
and let it go, and enj oy what you’re 
doing.”
Desiree is well aware of the fact 
that a dancer can’t dance forever. 
But so far, she hasn’t spent too 
much time worrying about it. “I’m
interested in teaching and coach­
ing,” she says. “But I don’t have 
any definite plans for the future. 
Right now I’m trying to get as 
much as I can and give as much as 
I can, because I don’t have much 
time left. Ten years if I’m lucky!”
One might think it would be 
easy to lose one’s vision in the 
wake of so much success, but 
Laura Desiree remains thought­
ful and focused. The most impor­
tant thing to her is what led her 
along this path from the begin­
ning — the love of dance.
“It’s very multi-dimensional. On 
one side it’s entertaining the au­
dience. On the other side it’s 
bringing something of yourself to 
the art; giving something back. 
Sometimes it’s the joy of move­
ment, or a means of expression, or 
the telling of a story, or living the 
music.
Sometimes, on stage, it feels as 
if you have become the music. 
That’s what’s fun. That’s really 
satisfying.”

Benedum Center from October 11- 
14. Tickets can be purchased by

Pittsburgh Public Theater lifts Iguana out of obscurity
$d Tx’’k XFvC,
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Night of the Iguana is not an easy play 
to come by. On its own the play is a 
remarkable achievement, but group it 
with the other works of playwright 
Tennessee Williams, classics like The 
Glass Menagerie and A Streetcar Named 
Desire, and it is easily overshadowed.
Still, the Pittsburgh Public Theater is 
presenting a production of Night of the 
Iguana that stars Olivia Williams and 
Marco St. John. The cast also includes 
sophomore drama majors Yancey Arias 
and Scott Foster as Pedro and Pancho 
andseniordramamajor Amanda Carlton 
as Hilda.
Neither Arias nor Foster had seen the 
Play before they auditionedfor their roles.

had hoped to be in the Kresge production 
of A Chorus Line and when that didn’t 
pan out, he took the role in Iguana. 
“Work is pretty much what I came back 
to school to do,” he explains, “So it’s kind 
of a miracle that I got this part.”
Night of the Iguana is the story of the 
scandalous Reverend Shannon (Marco
St. John) and the newly widowedMaxine 
(Olivia Williams) who manages a hotel 
on the coast of Mexico with the help of 
her two houseboys, Pedro and Pancho. It 
is at this hotel that they meet each other 
as well as Hannah and her grandfather 
“the oldest living poet.”
Now that Arias and Foster are famil­
iar with the play, they both speak highly 
ofits complexities and poetry. “Shannon’s 
character is so funny and clever, but 
there’s a lot of tension going on under­
neath,” says Foster.
Arias agrees. “There’s still lightness in 
it [the play]. It’s so intense that it’s funny.” 
Both actors are happy to see Olivia 
Williams, a black actress, taking on the 
usually white role of Maxine. “I think it’s 
wonderful that they cast the best Maxine 
that they could, that they didn’t let color 
stand in the way.” Foster says. “Hey, 
look at me, I’m black and I’m playing a
Mexican.”
Olivia Williams “certainly gives a lot of 
life and meat to the part,” says Arias. 
“When you have a woman who comes 
from the south, it doesn’t matter if she’s 
black or white, there’s a certain worldli­
ness to her.”
Arias has been able to help the other 
actors with some of their Spanish lines 
in the play. “It’s very convenient to be 
Hispanic and know the dialect of a 
Mexican,” Arias says. He has also helped 
make minor changes to the script. “The 
director will say ‘just give me something 
in Spanish there’ and I spit something 
out.” If he couldn’t remember how to say 
certain things, “I’d run to the phone and 
call home and say ‘Ma, how do you say 
this in Spanish again?’ ”
Although the actors have had rehears­
als all day over the past weeks, they are 
still expected to keep up with their
classes. “The stage manager did her best 
to work rehearsals around our classes, 
which is great.” Arias says. “Scott and I 
do our best to get to classes. We don’t 
take advantage of our rehearsal time. 
Because of our small parts — but good 
ones — we get a lot of time to ourselves 
and I can pull out my books.”
Once previews are over, they will be 
able to return to their regular classes 
and report to the theater in the evening.
Accordingto Arias and Foster, previews 
have gone well. “Any mistakes are only 
noticeable to the actors,” Arias promises. 
He also believes that the comraderie 
between the actors comes through in 
performances. “You can sense a family 
up there."
Night of the Iguana opens on October 5 
and will run until November 4. Call the 
Pittsburgh Public box office at 321-9800 
for ticket information.

Experience a day in the life of The Donald
The Art of the Deal, Part 2, by 
Donald Trump:
Many people ask me what a 
normal day in my life is like.
I usually start by giving a 
quarter to the doorman at Trump 
Tower. I used to give him a dollar, 
but now it makes the guys down 
at Manufacturers Hanover a little 
nervous.
By 8:15 I’m on the phone, doing 
deals. The first call is Randy 
Simpson, my man over at Chase 
Manhattan. He has a question 
about a $20 million interest pay­
ment.
“Hey, Randy, that’s not due till 
Tuesday. Check your calendar!”
I’ve known Randy for years. We 
frequently joke during business 
deals.
Randy tells me, if I don’t pay up, 
he’ll take my yacht and my man­
sion in Florida. In a typical Donald 
Trump day, we call this “Banker 
Talk.”
Next, breakfast with three of 
my largest investors — Bob 
Samson at First Fidelity Bancorp, 
Nick Wallinsky at Bankers Trust, 
and Fred Ferragamo at First 
Federal Boston. We’re having 
what’s called a “meeting” to talk 
about “money.”
At 9:43 we’re still going at it, 
when Nick uses the unfortunate 
word “deadbeat.” I’ve known Nick 
for years. What a joker! Our 
daughters go to the same private 
school.
At 10:15 I excuse myself, turn­
ing the bankers over to my closest 
advisor, Vinnie “The Hammer” 
Margolis. No sooner do I get back 
to my desk than another phone 
call comes in. It’s Stu Slussman, 
my personal divorce attorney and 
a pretty fair golfer in his own 
right. Stu has a question about 
Marla. He wants to know how 
many times we “did it.” I know it
JOE BOB GOES TO THE 
DRIVE IN

sounds funny, but the strangest 
things can affect corporate income 
in a real-estate business as large 
as mine.
Every morning at 11 I call my 
chief pit boss at the Taj Mahal, 
one of my three casino properties 
which, in my opinion, are the 
finest gamingpalaces in the world. 
John Mahoney, the man on duty 
this morning, takes my call and 
tells me a Japanese businessman 
has won $400,000 at the baccarat 
table. I tell Mahoney I’m not 
pleased. He promises to keep me 
informed.
Every businessman should keep 
time in his schedule for charities. 
At 12:151 have my secretary call 
the Lord & Taylor lingerie de­
partment and order the “Midnight 
Passion” two-piece stretch-mesh 
see-through bra and G-string, one 
of those kinds with the spaghetti 
straps and underwire support 
that’s open in the back and on a 
woman with a 36 double-D it kind 
of bounces when she walks, and I 
have the secretary send it to a 
needy woman I. met recently 
working in the bond department 
of Kidder Peabody.
I have just a few moments after 
lunch to prepare for my two o’clock 
meeting with the Sultan of Brunei, 
who wants to buy the Plaza Hotel. 
Even though it’s my favorite 
property, I’m never ashamed of
taking a profit when the opportu­
nity presents itself. Unfortu­
nately, I get a call at 1:45 from 
three Japanese banks informing 
me that they will be meeting with 
the Sultan of Brunei and that, if I 
try to horn in on the meeting, 
they’ll foreclose on $100 million 
worth of high-rise condo proper­
ties on the west side of Manhat­
tan. Vinnie The Hammer advises 
me to stay in my office, and I 
always do what Vinnie says.
John Mahoney calls back from 
the Taj Mahal, and tells me the 
Japanese businessman had a 
terrible run of luck and now owes 
the casino $600,000. I make my 
decision quickly.
“Take his money and kick him 
out.”
I find that it’s always best to 
speak briefly when it comes to 
business. John and I discuss the 
upcoming Wimbledon tennis 
tournament, then hang up. John 
has ejecting to do. I have more 
meetings with bankers.
People sometimes ask me, “Do 
you ever guarantee loans with 
your personal money?” And, of 
course, most real estate investors 
would tell you “No” or perhaps 
“Never” or perhaps “Are you 
crazy?”
Not me! I have $2 billion in 
bank debt, and $500 million of 
that is guaranteed by me per­
sonally. That’s why I have to go 
meet with eight more bankers 
right now. It’s funny what bank­
ers will do when you personally 
guarantee loans. They’ll take your 
yacht, they’ll take your luxury 
vacation homes, they’ll take your 
airline, they’ll take your hotel, 
they’ll take the royalties from your 
books, they’11 take your game show
— I suppose, if they could, they 
would take this new book that I’m 
writing, but there are certain
privileges you have when your 
name is Donald Trump and there’s 
no way they can take away The Art 
of the Deal, Part 2 unless they 
actually walked into my office and 
starting carting away furniture 
and then they walked up to me 
and took my paper away and my 
dictaphone and then took the pen 
out of my ... (manuscript ends 
here)
Speaking of time running out, 
they finally made the movie ver­
sion of the hit son g Big Bad John. 
I know it might seem like it took a 
long time, since the song went to 
number one on the charts in 1961, 
but think of it this way. The people 
who have been waiting for the 
movie are starting to develop 
brain tumors. They released this 
sucker just in time.
Jimmy Dean, the king of pure- 
pork sausage, stars in the movie, 
but here’s the weird part: They 
don’t use his version of the song 
Big Bad John. I don’t know who it 
is singing it, but he doesn’t have 
near the pipes Jimbo does. (Or 
did. Jimmy’s 62 years old.) Any­
how, except for that, and except 
for a lot of the plot not making 
sense, it’s a pretty decent flick 
about an old coot retired sheriff 
living with his beer-drinking dog 
Catfish in a Louisiana swamp 
cabin—until Jack Elam andNed 
Beatty come find him and con­
vince him to go find Big Bad John, 
who killed a man and ran off with 
the sheriff’s daughter.
Jimmy Dean plays the sheriff 
who goes trucking up through 
Colorado and New Mexico in 
search of BBJ, and he decides to 
take along the only friend he’ll 
need — “Gator,” a quadruple- 
barreled shotgun. It’s kind of one 
of those action swamp western 
mining love stories. Kinda grows 
on you.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 1 October 1990L13
Toilet seats run amok in Snake Rattle N Roll
- College students have so many 
things to worry about. Grades, a 
social life, getting up for your 
I classes, doingyour laundry before
¦ you run out of underwear, and, of 
: course, money.
That’s right, the big “M” word.
Let’s face it, just about every- 
' thing here costs money. And for 
those of us who happen to exhibit 
a nasty video game habit, our 
! money supply is under an even 
i greater strain.
I bet everyone has experienced 
this scenario: you motor on down 
to the local Toys R Us and lo and 
; behold, there’s that Nintendo 
; game which you’ve been wanting 
' for only the last year and a half or 
I so. Only your stomach does a 
¡ double back-flip when you dis­
cover that that hunk of plastic
¦ and silicon is going to cost you a 
; mere $59.99 (plus tax).
It’s at times like these that I 
look towards the Heavens and
¦ thank my lucky stars that the 
I video rental stores now carry 
! Nintendo games. Notonly do they 
¦carry them, but thanks to our
wonderful capitalistic system of 
supply and demand, mostofthese 
places rent the games very 
cheaply.
So, as a public service to all you 
video game junkies, I’ll give you a 
rundown of all the local video 
rental stores which rent video 
games, how much they cost, and 
where the stores are located.
First under the spotlight is the 
Icing of the video rental chains,
' Blockbuster Video, which can be 
found on 1538 Baum Boulevard.
' On top of its excellent selection of 
video tapes, its selection of 
Nintendo games is equally im­
pressive. Blockbuster also has 
about two or three copies of each 
game. However, the store makes 
you pay for its large stock when it 
comes to rental prices. Three

nights will cost you $3.18 per car­
tridge — ouch. Also, sometimes 
the instruction booklet is missing 
from the game, which is a real 
pain. So I don’t recommend 
Blockbuster unless you’re really 
desperate.
Next up is the Pepsi Cola of the 
video rental chains, West Coast 
Video on 1900 Murray Avenue. 
Its selection of Nintendo games 
isn’t as large as Blockbuster and 
its price is the same as Block­
buster, but you can only rent a 
game for two nights; therefore, 
you pay less. It will cost you $2.10 
per cartridge for two nights if you 
go to West Coast. That’s a good 
price, but you can do better, much 
better.
On top of the food, plants, books, 
magazines, medicine, and video 
tapes, the monster Giant Eagle 
on the corner of Shady and Penn, 
which is open 24 hours a day, 
rents video games as well. The 
selection is okay and mostly con­
sists of newer Nintendo releases. 
Giant Eagle charges only 95 cents 
a day (first day free) per game, 
and includes instructions with all 
its games. Sounds pretty amazing 
huh? Wait — the best is yet to 
come.
Right up the street from West 
Coast is a fairly new place called 
Phar-Mor Discounts, on the cor­
ner of Forbes and Shady. This 
place has more Nintendo games 
than the other three places com­
bined}. At last count I saw nine
copies ofSolstice alone! And Phar- 
Mor’s prices are as equally 
amazing as its stock. It rents three 
Nintendo games for only $1.59 for 
two nights. That’s right, only 53 
cents per game per day. It doesn’t 
get any better than this.
Speaking of Nintendo, the 
company has just came out with a 
new game called Snake Rattle N 
Roll. At first I was very hesitant 
to play this game. The name was 
pretty silly, as well as the cover 
art on the box. However, I was 
impressed by the pictures I saw of 
the actual game itself. So I decided 
“what the hell” and got the game....
Which turned out to be the 
biggest mistake of my life.
You see, once I started playing, 
the TV set took control over my 
eyes and I couldn’t seem to unweld 
the stupid Nintendo controller out 
of my hands!
I can’t stop playing this game\
Well, maybe talking about it 
will ease my suffering (however, 
typing with this Nintendo con­
troller stuck to my hands is total 
hell).
Snake Rattle N Roll is a very 
weird game. In it you play a snake 
named either Rattle or Roll 
(hence, the name of the game). 
Your whole purpose in life is to 
eat as many Nibbley Pibbleys 
(little colorful spherical objects) 
as possible. These energetic little 
bundles of food cause your snake 
to grow in size, which, in turn, 
makes it harder to kill.
The size of your snake also af­
fects exiting the current level. You 
see, at the end of each level is a 
door, and the only way in which 
you can exit the level is through 
this door, and the only way to 
open this door is to jump onto a 
big scale and ring a bell. So, in 
essence, the main theme of this 
game is to see how fat you can get. 
How can you argue with a theme

like that?
Now if this all sounds nice and 
easy to you, you’d be right, be­
cause it is, except for one little 
problem — monsters. Don’t they 
always just seem to pop up in the 
most inconvenient places? And in 
Snake Rattle N Roll there are a 
host of enemies between you and 
that exit, and they are, to say the 
very least, strange.
These nasties range from killer 
checkers to exploding pin cush­
ions to poisonous toilet seat cov­
ers which try to eat you. And 
when they do get ahold of you, 
each monster has its very own, 
usually quite funny, way of kill­
ing you.
All you have in your defense are 
two small, but powerful, weapons 
— your slick, long tongue, and 
your body weight, which you can 
throw around. If you jump on top 
of nasties you can smush them 
into oblivion, or you can cause 
them to explode by swatting them 
enough times with your tongue.
I told you it was a weird game.
In total there are eleven levels
in Snake Rattle N Roll. 
Throughout these worlds you can 
encounter flowing waterfalls, fly­
ing carpets, towering cliffs, and 
other sights. All are depicted in a 
3-D perspective which is an abso­
lute pleasure to look at. Some­
times, like all 3-D games, the 
graphics do get a little bit confus­
ing and become difficult to ma­
neuver through. But for the most 
part, Nintendo did a very good job 
with the 3-D perspective. Actu­
ally, Nintendo did agreat job with 
the graphics in general.
Everything in this game is crisp 
and clear. You can actually see 
various expressions on the face of 
your snake, as well of some of the 
enemies, while the Nibbley 
Pibbleys take on diverse person­
alities of their own.
On one level they have wings 
and fly around (Pibblebats), on 
another they have little legs and 
run around (Pibblejoggers), while 
on yet another level they bounce 
all over the place (Pibbleboings). 
And when you eat a Nibbley 
Pibbley, your snake will first chew 
a little, and then spit out the ex­
tra appendages (such as wings or 
feet). It is perhaps the funniest 
(and in some ways the sickest) 
thing I’ve ever seen in a video 
game.
That’s pretty much it. All you 
really do is run around, eat things, 
kill things, and get fat. It might 
not sound like much, but it’s done
very well, and it’s so addictive.
There are a few small problems 
with the game. Sometimes the 
graphics get confusing and a little 
messed up when there are a lot of 
objects on the screen at one time. 
But that’s a common problem with 
all video games. Another problem 
is that there are only eleven lev­
els. You won’t win the game in 
one sitting, but I doubt it will take 
you more than a few weeks to 
complete. The music also gets a 
little repetitive, but at least it’s 
easy on the ear.
As for the advantages, I forgot 
to mention the fact that two people 
can play at once. It’s done well 
and if you and your friend can get 
your act together, it can make the 
game much easier to play. 
Nintendo should also be com­
mended on the excellent 3-D 
graphics.
For the final evaluation, on a 
scale of one to ten, I give the 
graphics a nine, the sound and 
music a seven, and the playabil­
ity a nine. Overall I give Snake 
Rattle N Roll an eight.
Tune in next week for a review 
of a new game—that is if I manage 
to unattach the controller from 
my hands.

Rejoice in the rebirth of The Uncanny X-Men
Sometimes you sit at your desk 
and your nose is stuffed and 
dripping incessantly and your 
head is pounding and the light 
burns your eyes and all you want 
; to do is turn it off and hide un­
derneath a blanket till tomorrow 
morning. But you can’t because 
it’s only eight o’clock and there’s 
so much more you can accomplish 
before the night is over.
So you push yourself to stay 
awake but the pounding gets 
harder and you begin to feel your 
upper lip, and there is so much 
numbness all around. There are 
voices down the hall but they’re 
meaningless.
Why is anyone saying anything, 
how can the world continue to 
turn while you are in pain? It 
turns all right, and with each 
movement it ties your spine into 
knots because you’ll be damned if 
you have to admit that the axis of 
rotation of the world isn’t your 
tspine. Turning harder, the knot 
;gets tighter, and you wait, a vic­
tim of your own vanity.
There was a book I read a long 
.time ago. I only read the beginning 
and I can’t remember the name. 
"There was a man in that book 
'who wanted to feel every second 
of his life because he thought ev­
erything was slipping away. He 
took tacks and lay down on them 
.and felt the pain of the sharp 
‘metal stabbing into his shoulder 
blades and spine.
All of a sudden, he could feel 
¿very second going by, could see 
every grain of sand pass through 
‘the hour glass, as all his world 
.turned into a ugly red pulsating 
sore that wouldn’t go away. He 
measured life by the sound of 
heartbeats instead of meaning­
less numbers placed on the round, 
plastic faces of two armed false 
¦gods.
COMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
His wish came true, I guess, for 
all of a sudden instead of a smear, 
his life had definition.
Waiting, waiting for the pain to 
go away, for your nose to stop 
running, for the warmth of the 
morning light, waiting for the time 
when all the grains of sand are 
sleeping at the bottom of an hour 
glass. Does such a world exist? Is 
there ever such a thing as an 
ending?
Sometimes it just feels like all 
we ever do is wait, wait for 
something that never comes. And 
in waiting we fail to take notice of 
the simple pleasures of waiting.
The simple pleasures of sitting 
in a leather chair, the feeling of 
fulfillment at ripping off an over­
grown nail, the warmth of the 
clothes on your back, the infinite 
shades of grey on a cloudy day, 
the delicate sound of a voice that 
cares. Look at the world and feel 
it, listen to the thunder of your 
heart, feel the blood rushing to 
your calves as vibrantly as it did 
the first day you were bom. For 
people, there is an end to waiting, 
because we can destroy waiting 
by living, by, for lack of a better 
cliche, taking time to smell the 
roses.
But sadly, in the world of com­
ics, there is no such thing as 
smelling the roses. What you see 
is what you get, and if there is 
nothing there you cannot put it
there. It is as empty as a rusty 
band-aid box with no band-aids 
in it. The paper cut on the fourth 
finger of your left hand screams 
for mercy as the air viciously 
gnaws and tears at the raw nerves. 
There are no more band-aids'in 
the box. It is empty.
Empty as some of the comics 
I’ve read. Once upon a time The 
Uncanny X-Men used to be like 
this. It seemed like for years, the 
book had absolutely no direction. 
Events would just flow randomly. 
It almost felt like writer Chris 
Claremont was ad-libbing the 
entire book and did whatever 
came to mind. Loose ends built up 
and grew larger and larger, and it 
seemed like nobody really cared. 
The artwork was lethargic, the 
characters were just parodies of 
their former selves, and one could 
not escape the frustrating, chok­
ing sensation of... waiting.
I think during this long period 
the book lost a lot of loyal readers, 
who were fed up with a book with 
a steadily decreasing radius, go­
ing in circles.
But then something happened 
a few months ago. All of a sudden, 
the X-Men started to get inter­
esting again. There was a sense of 
direction, a sense that there was 
a light at the end of the tunnel. 
Not only that but the ride to the 
final destination became inter­
esting, creating little tunnels of 
its own.
All of a sudden there was a 
sense of urgency, and most of all 
a feeling of family, a feeling of 
importance and meaning. 
Claremont brought back a lot of 
old characters, introduced some 
new ones, and the book got a new 
artist.
All of a sudden the book had a 
large ensemble cast with a vari­
ety of diverse and interesting

supporting characters that had 
accumulated over the years, and 
were now being explored. Every­
thing old was new again. There 
was still that sense of waiting, 
but now there were roses to smell 
along the way.
I’ll never get over how comics 
parallel our lives. It just seems to 
me that books with a lot of sup­
porting characters are usually the 
best books on the market. With­
out family and friends we even­
tually become rootless, drifting, 
and waiting. Waiting for what? 
Usually nothing, but still we need 
to feel that there is something out 
there that is worth going on for. 
So we wait.
There’s one of the nicest scenes 
in comics that I’ve read in a long 
time. Jean Grey and Storm, two 
of the primary characters in the 
X-Men family, finally get around 
renewing a friendship after more 
than eight years. There they are 
sitting eating hamburgers at a 
restaurant they used to come to 
years ago.
Storm, who is now trapped in 
the body of a 13-year-old girl, and 
Jean Grey, who is finally putting
the pieces of a severe split person­
ality problem behind her, glow 
with strength and wisdom. “To 
the X-Men, then! Who do not die 
the old-fashioned way. And no 
matter how hard we try... none of 
us die forever,” toasts Storm. I 
thought it was kind of sweet.
At the end, it almost seems like 
Claremont is apologizing for all 
his years of inane writing when 
Storm admits some of the mis­
takes the X-Men have made 
throughout the years. Apology 
accepted, Mr. Claremont.
And so it goes, the rebirth of the 
X-Men. This fall marks the be­
ginning of the “X-Tinction 
Agenda,” a plan by the island 
nation of Genosha to hunt down 
the X-Men family and execute 
them.
Genosha is one of the most
prosperous nations in the world 
but the secret of their success lies 
in that they take mutants from 
their population and turn them 
into mindless slaves. The mutants 
then supply all of the raw mate­
rial and labor for the economy. It 
is in some ways a dark parable of 
the situation in South Africa.
The first three parts of the nine- 
part serial, which runs through 
the main mutant books, arrived 
this month. It just might be a 
pleasant surprise to all of you 
who had lost faith. The waitingis 
over for the X-Men; it’s time to 
come home.

Horsefeathers
Grab your cigar, fake funny glasses, and nose, and 
come out to watch the zaniest of all the Marx Brothers 
movies. Groucho is the president of Huxley College, 
which is in dire need of a competent football team. So 
he hires Chico and Harpo to help him fix the season. 
Does he really think he can pull one over on the ole’ 
“origin of the species,” Darwin University? While 
Chico and Harpo make numerous blunders in at­
tempting to save the football team, Groucho comes 
out of remission from his infamous “hotpants” disease 
and competes for the attention of the voluptuous 
college widow, Thelma Todd.
You don’t know comedy until you’ve seen these 
brothers at work.

Ferris’ family believes that he is home, deathly ill, 
Ferris is enacting the most complete and stunning 
escape from high school in the nearby city of Chicago 
with his girlfriend, Sloane, and his best friend, 
Cameron. However, Mr. Rooney, Ferris’ principal, is 
not convinced of Ferris’ illness and makes it his 
personal vendetta to catch him skipping. The day is 
full of close calls with Principal Rooney and Ferris’

Amityville Horror
You can never trust a real estate agent — well, at 
least not the ones in Amityville, Long Island. A 
family man (James Brolin) falls in love with a “sup­
posedly” haunted house and quickly establishes 
himself there with his family. As one could have 
guessed by now, the house is possessed by evil (could 
it be... Satan?). Hordes offlies on the window screens 
and that familiar dark red substance coming from 
the faucet are treated with bug spray and Ajax. (Isn’t 
blood enough to make your mortgage payments late?) 
Soon enough, the head of the household is possessed 
and has taken an interest in running after his family 
with an ax. How many will survive his murderous 
rampage? How many will walk away from the wicked 
house into the soothing sunset? And... will anyone be 
stupid enough to put the house back onto the real 
estate market?
