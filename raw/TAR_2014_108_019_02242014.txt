Under Construction helps students network
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
News Editor
Students of the Dietrich 
College of Humanities & So-
cial Sciences ?led into the 
University Center’s Rangos 
Hall Saturday morning, wear-
ing neat business casual attire 
— for the most part — after an 
email from Siriana Abboud, 
sophomore psychology and 
French double major, warned 
that “Wrinkled is good for rai-
sins, but not for respect.”
Abboud was one of the or-
ganizers of Under Construc-
tion: Building Your Future, 
the second annual Dietrich 
College career-building event. 
Under Construction began at 
10:30 a.m. and lasted until 
5:30 p.m., and included a 
keynote speech, panels, and a 
networking session complete 
with hors d’oeuvres.
Students reported to Ran-
gos Hall ?rst for a welcome by 
the Dean of Dietrich College 
John Lehoczky. 
“Today, this Under Con-
struction event is a whole new 
approach to building your ca-
reer, whether you’re a sopho-
more, junior, or senior” Le-
hoczky said. “Today we have 
over 60 H&SS alums, who 
have come back just to sup-
port you.”
Lehoczky stressed that the

returned to Pittsburgh for the 
Senate presents “First Lectures”
Tuberculosis comes to CMU campus
BRENT HEARD 
Contributing Editor
On Feb. 11, an email was 
sent to the campus commu-
nity about a case of tuberculo-
sis (TB) on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus, affecting a visiting re-
searcher at the Heinz School.
The email, sent by direc-
tor of Health Services Anita 
Barkin, said, “at this point, it 
appears that the individual’s 
contacts are limited to a small 
number of Heinz College com-
munity members.”
On Feb. 10, the Allegheny 
County Health Department 
(ACHD) contacted Health 
Services regarding the re-
searcher who had contracted 
the disease. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention’s website, tu-
berculosis is caused by a bac-
terial infection which attacks 
the lungs, “but TB bacteria 
can attack any part of the body 
such as the kidney, spine, and 
brain. If not treated properly, 
TB disease can be fatal.”
Last Thursday Dr. Barkin 
reported to The Tartan, “we 
have tested all of the close 
contacts and there are no ad-
ditional active cases found.”
The individuals who were 
tested were identi?ed as close 
contacts by the diagnosed per-
son, and have all had negative 
results on their ?rst-round 
test.
 After eight to 10 weeks, 
they will be screened once 
again. “You can convert from 
negative to positive and it

Two Carnegie Mellon se-
niors recently gave 20-min-
ute speeches about their ex-
periences at the university. 
Hosted by Student Senate, 
the inaugural session of the 
“First Lectures” series took 
place on Thursday, Feb. 21 in 
Porter Hall. Senior chemis-
try major Lukas Ronner and 
senior chemical engineering 
major Michelle Ruiz were the 
two seniors selected to speak 
in the ?rst installment of the 
“First Lectures.”
The “First Lectures” was 
originally the brainchild of 
?rst-year economics and sta-
tistics double major, Vaasavi 
Unnava, a member-at-large 
in Student Senate. The title 
is a clear allusion to the title 
of the late Randy Pausch’s 
The Last Lecture. In his lec-
ture and subsequent book, 
Pausch discussed his journey 
through life and the dreams 
he accomplished.
The Last Lecture, which 
is distributed to incoming 
freshmen at the university 
during Orientation, had a 
strong impact on Unnava. Ac-
cording to Unnava, one of the 
book’s lines made her pause: 
“It’s not about how to achieve 
your dreams, it’s about how 
to lead your life.”
Unnava stated she wanted 
to hear seniors’ ?rst lectures 
of the rest of their lives, and 
went to Student Senate with 
her idea.
In the ?rst part of the 
event, Ruiz talked about her 
odyssey at Carnegie Mellon. 
She talked about how she 
changed during her time at 
the university, saying, “Fresh-
man year is when you real-
ize you’re not in high school. 
And the sophomore transi-
tion is about what you’re do-
ing in life. My freshman year, 
I struggled academically. 
But I learned I was not the 
smartest, no longer the most 
involved student on campus. 
When I had a GPA below a 
3.0, I was shocked. This con-
?dent lady was a wreck. I had 
a low self-esteem of all sorts, 
and that was not like me.”
But Ruiz did not let her 
?rst semester deter her. “I 
was surrounded by mentors 
who said, ‘Stop it right there; 
you’re not alone.’ I sat in the 
front row and discovered the 
magic of [Hunt Library].”
Ruiz urged students to 
take advantage of their time 
at Carnegie Mellon, saying 
during her speech, “There’s 
more to CMU than books; 
there’s opportunity.” Despite 
her struggles, Ruiz had three 
internship offers by the end 
of her ?rst year.
Ruiz obtained an intern-
ship from ExxonMobil, where 
she met a valuable mentor, 
Greg. “Greg pushed me for so 
many semesters,” Ruiz said. 
“After a couple years, he’d say 
‘GPA is really important, but 
what happens here is more 
important.’ ”
Ruiz said that her sopho-
more year taught her to “val-
ue in quality not quantity;” 
that she was “not true to my 
potential to overextend my-
self,” and that “quitting is 
okay when setting long-term 
goals.”
Ruiz communicated three 
lessons that she had learned 
to the audience: “be humble,” 
“use small hiccups to pro-
pel you to where you want 
to be,” and learn that “ev-
ery experience is a learning 
experience.”
Ronner presented to the 
audience next. When stu-
dents ?rst come to Carnegie 
Mellon, he said, “Your men-
tality is to outcompete other 
people. And that mentality is 
wrong. Suddenly everything 
you do is on a stage. People 
were separated into smart 
and dumb. But you don’t 
need to be a genius to change 
the world.”
Ronner then gave anex-
ample to illustrate his words. 
“Mammograms don’t cure 
cancer,” he noted, “but they 
still prevent people from dy-
ing. Some people are born 
with talents and aptitudes 
that are inherent to them. I 
can never be like them. I need 
to do it my own way.”
Ronner wants to change 
the grade-driven mentality 
harbored by students. “When 
I stopped worrying about 
stupid things, the grades

Starting July 1, current 
head of the philosophy de-
partment Richard Scheines 
will become the new Dean of 
the Dietrich College of Hu-
manities & Social Sciences. 
Scheines, replacing the 
current Dean of Dietrich Col-
lege, Thomas Lord professor 
of statistics John Lehoczky, 
has been head of the depart-
ment of philosophy since 
2005. Scheines has also 
served on three National 
Academy of Sciences com-
mittees as casual methodolo-
gist since 2005.  
According to an email 
sent out by Provost and Ex-
ecutive Vice President Mark 
Kamlet, he is “extraordinari-
ly well suited to be the Diet-
rich College’s next dean.”
Scheines has had many 
successes as head of the de-
partment of philosophy, the 
email says. “Under his lead-
ership the department has 
thrived in both research and 
education. External research 
funding has more than tri-
pled and is supporting in-
terdisciplinary research in 
statistics, machine learning, 
brain science, mathematics, 
and other ?elds.”
Scheines was chosen as 
Dean by the Dietrich Col-
lege Dean Search Commit-
tee, which was chaired by 
Richard G. Tucker, the Paul 
Mellon University professor 
of applied linguistics. 
Lehoczky had been Dean 
of Dietrich College since 
2000. After Scheines takes 
over, Lehoczky will resume 
his role as a professor in the 
department of statistics. A 
celebration of Lehoczky’s 
time at Carnegie Mellon is 
slated for later this spring.
Coordinator of Student 
Activities Tim Leonard gave a 
presentation to Student Sen-
ate to ask that they pass a rec-
ommendation to increase the 
Arts Pass Program line item in 
next year’s Senate’s budget to 
$26,000. A motion was made 
to decrease the recommenda-
tion to $21,000, the amount 
granted to Arts Pass Program 
this academic year after the 
vote to increase the line item 
earlier in the meeting.
To guarantee the sustain-
ability of the Arts Pass pro-
gram, a motion was made to 
request that a plan for sustain-
ability be provided to Senate 
when the allocation is dis-
pensed next semester. Senate 
passed the recommendation; 
although this recommendation 
does not allocate any money, 
it requests that next year’s 
Senate stay true to the recom-
mended budget.
Last academic year, Stu-
dent Senate allocated $16,500 
in its budget for the Arts Pass 
Program. The program is run-
ning a de?cit because of two 
events at Phipps Conserva-
tory: the corpse ?ower bloom-
ing and the Winter Light Gar-
den Flower Show. Students 
receive free admissions to 
Phipps Conservatory under 
the program.
Coordinator of Student 
Activities Tim Leonard asked 
Senate for an additional 
$4,500 to cover the $9,000 
de?cit that the Arts Pass pro-
gram is projected to run this 
year.
A motion was made and 
passed to raise the Arts Pass 
Program line item in Senate’s 
budget to $21,000 to meet 
Student Activities’ request.

Recently, Dean of the 
School of Computer Science 
Randy Bryant sent an email 
out to the college relaying 
that Director of the Human 
Computer Interaction Insti-
tute (HCII) Justine Cassell 
has stepped down. 
According to the email, 
Cassell is stepping down from 
her role as director of the 
HCII in favor of a newly cre-
ated position, assistant vice 
provost of technology strat-
egy and impact.
“Given the many duties 
this position will require, 
Justine has decided to step 
down from the directorship 
of the HCII at the end of this 
academic year,” Bryant said 
in the email. “I am consulting 
with university administra-
tion on how we will make the 
transition to new leadership. 
She will, of course, remain 
a member of our faculty as 
well.”
In this new position, the 
email says, Cassell “will pro-
vide important leadership to 
university-level strategic ini-
tiatives, such as the recently 
announced Simon Initiative 
in human learning.”
Justine Cassell holds dual 
Ph.D degrees in psychology 
and linguistics from the Uni-
versity of Chicago, as well 
as degrees from institutions 
in Scotland and France, and 
has worked at Northwestern 
University and the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology.
As director of the HCII, 
Cassell has made many im-
provements, including “out-
standing new additions to 
the faculty; programmatic 
growth of the Institute’s edu-
cational programs; signi?-
cant, successful fundraising 
efforts; the establishment of 
the Masters in Educational 
Technology and Applied 
Learning Sciences; and the 
enhancement of HCII’s physi-
cal facilities,” the email says.

Special Allocation: CMU in Haiti
CMU in Haiti is a new or-
ganization that is planning a 
spring break trip to Haiti to 
build communities and form 
a long-lasting communal 
bond. Nine students and two 
professors will be traveling to 
Haiti from March 9–14. CMU 
in Haiti requested $5,500 to 
cover their travel and lodging 
costs.
Because the two profes-
sors going on the trip do not 
pay the student activities fee, 
which funds Senate’s special 
allocations, a motion was 
made to reduce the alloca-
tion to $4,500 — since each 
traveler accounted for $500 
of the request — which Stu-
dent Senate then granted to 
CMU in Haiti.

Dietrich College alumni share experiences in Under Construction
event were the key to Under 
Construction’s success. “Not 
only do [these alumni] repre-
sent a huge range of different 
career paths — from advertis-
ing to international develop-
ment to health care to creative 
arts and entertainment — but 
most importantly they are 
H&SS graduates,” Lehoczky 
said. “They understand your 
college experience and your 
career search dilemma. They 
fully understand the challeng-
es, because they faced exactly 
those challenges when they 
were students here. They are 
volunteering to be resources 
for you.”
Lehoczky also introduced 
Under Construction’s keynote 
speaker, Terry Babcock-Lu-
mish (H&SS ‘97). Babcock-
Lumish graduated from the 
College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences with a B.S. in 
policy and management. She 
is currently president of Islay 
Consulting LLC, “an econom-
ic, policy, and political consul-
tancy she founded in 2005 to 
meet the needs of innovative 
global clients committed to ef-
fecting positive change, from 
local to global,” according to 
the event’s program.
Babcock-Lumish broke her 
advice into three discrete les-
sons. Babock-Lumish’s ?rst 
adage was “semper gumby,” 
meaning “always ?exible.” 
Babcock-Lumish warned stu-
dents against planning their 
lives down to the moment; 
she stressed how important 
it is to adapt to unexpected 
circumstances. 
Babcock-Lumish gave the 
example of meeting her hus-
band as an unexpected event 
that changed her life. “He was 
not in the plan,” she said. “We 
can’t plan for everything in 
life, like falling in love with 
someone that was geographi-
cally inconvenient, who also 
has a turbo career and their 
own timeline.”
Babcock-Lumish next ad-
vised the students to optimize 
their résumés because “the 
reality is, we’ve got to fall in 
love with you in two dimen-
sions with that résumé, before 
we can ever meet you and in-
vite you to the interview to 
fall in love with you in three 
dimensions.”
The keynote speaker’s 
last lesson was a simple 
reminder that undergraduates 
and alumni alike were still 
“under construction,” compar-
ing them to the construction 
site that was the University 
Center when she graduated in 
1997. “Regardless of where we 
are in our lives, in our careers, 
we are all under construction,” 
Babcock-Lumish said.
After the keynote speech, 
Dietrich students engaged in 
lunchtime discussions with 
Dietrich College alumni at 
tables that were divided by in-
dustries. 
Following the lunch and 
keynote speech, Under Con-
struction attendees went to 
two panels they had chosen 
when they registered, on top-
ics ranging from technology to 
editing and publishing to pub-
lic health, health policy, and 
health professions. In each 
of these panels, a few alumni 
spoke about their experiences 
and how undergradutes can 
get started in the ?eld.
The next piece of Under 
Construction was a student 
internship panel, in which ?ve 
undergraduate Dietrich stu-
dents, including sophomore 
international relations and 
politics major Noël Um, senior 
economics and professional 
writing double major Zaneta 
Grant, junior professional 
writing major Lauren Wil-
liams, senior economics major 
Michael Shin, and senior eth-
ics, history, and public policy 
major Lara Dorko, spoke about 
their own internship experi-
ences.
Finally, students networked 
with alumni back in Rangos 
Hall while eating ?nger foods.
Sanjana Baldwa, sopho-
more psychology major, said 
she thought Under Construc-
tion was a good effort on be-
half of Dietrich College to help 
students network and see what 
they can do with their degrees 
in the humanities and social 
sciences. “I really liked all of 
the different alumni; I think 
it was really cool to hear all of 
their different stories, and see 
what they do,” Baldwa said. “It 
was a good event for network-
ing — just things to look out 
for and people to reach out to 
if [students] need a mentor or 
something.”
Editor’s Note: Noël Um is as-
sistant news editor of The Tar-
tan, and Lauren Williams is a 
staffwriter. 
Ronner and Ruiz give advice
came,” Ronner said. “The 
sleep makes you happy. I’ve 
?gured out the world is yours, 
as long as you see yourself in 
absolutes.”
Ruiz, born in Ecuador and 
raised in Miami, Fla., is a sis-
ter in the sorority Tri Delta 
and community advisor for 
Donner House. 
She has also served as a 
Sexual Assault Advisor and 
a SafeZone advisor for mem-
bers of the LGBTQ communi-
ty and has been involved with 
organizations like the Society 
of Hispanic Professional En-
gineers and Dancer’s Sym-
posium. She will work in 
Virginia for ExxonMobil after 
gradation.
Ronner is from Haddon-
?eld, N.J., and has been a res-
ident assistant, Orientation 
Counselor, and Scotch’n’Soda 
member in the past, and is 
currently chair of Student 
Senate.
Unnava said that it was 
dif?cult to choose the seniors 
who would speak in the lec-
ture series. “There were 31 
nominations, which wasn’t 
expected,” Unnava said in an 
interview. “We put together a 
rubric based on novelty, clar-
ity, organization, impact and 
depth. We assembled scores 
and looked at the top 20. It 
was really hard to make that 
decision because everyone 
was really good. And then, 
we had to ?nd our top six and 
tried to get the event logisti-
cally together.” 
For seniors not selected, 
Unnava said, “We put to-
gether a video of things they 
learned.”
Unnava said, “Kids that 
are there want to get things 
done and want to make an 
impact on their community. 
They’re not afraid to say, ‘Hey, 
let’s start something new.’ ”
Campus visitor contracts TB
doesn’t mean you’re conta-
gious,” Barkin explained, not-
ing that without symptoms of 
active TB, an individual may 
have latent TB, which can be 
treated with medication.
Madelyn Miller, director 
of Environmental Health and 
Safety, said, “We followed Al-
legheny County’s guidance 
and our own guidelines,” re-
vealing that they spoke with 
the diagnosed individual as 
well as the people who had 
been in “close, constant con-
tact” with the person.
“To send out a mass com-
munication would have been 
ineffective,” Miller explained. 
“We had to do this on a per-
sonal level. We were being 
ultra cautious, and contacted 
anyone who he could have 
breathed or coughed on.”
Barkin’s email warned, “It 
is important to know that you 
can only contact TB bacteria if 
you spend time near someone 
with TB disease,” adding, “the 
TB bacteria are put into the 
air when a person with active 
TB disease coughs, sneezes, 
speaks, or sings.” It is not pos-
sible, however, to contract 
the disease from exposure 
to clothes, glasses, utensils, 
handshakes, toilets, or other 
surfaces with which people 
may touch.
Miller recalled that the 
university underwent a desk-
top drill simulating a menin-
gitis outbreak in August, simi-
lar to a the recent outbreak at 
Princeton University. 
“It was clear that we could 
handle a meningitis outbreak, 
which is much more conta-
gious than tuberculosis,” Mill-
er said.
If anyone has questions 
regarding the TB case or 
wishes to be tested they 
should call Health Services at 
(412) 268-2157.

TechBridgeWorld hosts biennial event

TechBridgeWorld, a research group started from within the Robotics Institute, hosted an event that showcased their mission and their research.  
BROOKE KUEI
SciTech Editor
While many of us curse in 
frustration when our sleek, 
advanced laptops occasion-
ally crash or when our touch-
screen smartphones some-
times lose signal, there are 
people in developing coun-
tries and individuals with dis-
abilities that do not even have 
the luxury of the technology 
we take for granted. While 
there are many organizations 
with goals to provide aid and 
relief to communities in need, 
Carnegie Mellon is tackling 
this global issue in a unique 
way: through technology.
TechBridgeWorld — a re-
search group founded by as-
sociate research professor at 
the Robotics Institute M. Ber-
nardine Dias — aims to use 
innovative technology to cre-
ate solutions for sustainable 
development. “We build part-
nerships with underserved 
communities in the U.S. and 
around the world to create 
culturally appropriate tech-
nology that adheres to each 
community’s vision of prog-
ress, and to inspire and train 
future researchers and tech-
nologists,” said Ermine Teves, 
TechBridgeWorld project as-
sistant, in an email.
To celebrate their 10-year 
anniversary, the research 
group hosted a biennial 
TechBridgeWorld Interactive 
last Thursday in the Newell-
Simon Hall Perlis Atrium. 
The event raised awareness 
of global development needs 
and showcased TechBridge-
World’s research to the cam-
pus community. Sponsors for 
the event included the Robot-
ics Institute, Diyunu Consult-
ing, LLC, the President’s Of-
?ce, the Of?ce of the Dean of 
Student Affairs, the School of 
Computer Science, the Heinz 
School, and Google.
Aptly named, TechBridge-
World Interactive was de-
signed so that participants 
could actively learn about 
TechBridgeWorld’s mission 
through different games and 
challenges. 
TechBridgeWorld Interac-
tive focused on two speci?c 
themes: navigation for the 
visually impaired, and litera-
cy. The theme of navigation 
for the visually impaired was 
explored through different 
activities and poster presenta-
tions along the left side of the 
Perlis Atrium, while the theme 
of literacy was demonstrated 
through another row of pre-
sentations along the right side 
of the Perlis Atrium.
The ?rst challenge for the 
theme of visual impairment 
required participants to wear 
goggles that simulated the 
sight of an individual who is 
completely blind in the right 
eye and partially blind in the 
left eye. Another visual im-
pairment challenge involved 
attempting to give directions 
to a blind person. Participants 
were given the map of a ho-
tel and had to describe how 
to get from the entrance to a 
speci?c room in the hotel as if 
they were giving directions to 
someone who was blind. This 
challenge made it evident that 
simply telling someone who is 
visually impaired to turn left 
or right is insuf?cient; suc-
cessful navigation requires 
describing nearby familiar 
sounds or smells, or a speci?c 
number of steps to take. 
Also on the left side of the 
room was a solution to aid-
ing the visually impaired. 
The project was called Wrist 
Ranger and is the product of 
a Small Undergraduate Re-
search Grant (SURG). The 
members of the research 
group were sophomore elec-
trical and computer engineer-
ing and robotics double major 
Clayton Ritcher, sophomore 
electrical and computer engi-
neering major Nora Shoemak-
er, and junior electrical and 
computer engineering major 
Vivek Nair. Their research ad-
visor was Dias. According to 
their poster, the motivation 
of the project was “to ?nd an 
effective way to provide the 
visually impaired with spatial 
feedback of their surround-
ings.” The device is essentially 
a wristband with sensors that 
can use haptic feedback to in-
form users of how close the 
wristband is to an object.
The right side of the Per-
lis Atrium included challenges 
and presentations for the is-
sue of literacy. In the ?rst 
challenge, participants had 
to watch videos in different 
languages, such as Arabic, 
Chinese, or Spanish. The pur-
pose of this exercise was to 
give the participant a feeling 
of how confused one might 
feel while in a country that 
predominantly speaks an un-
familiar language. The second 
literacy challenge asked the 
participant to label the United 
States, Bangladesh, Uruguay, 
Ghana, Qatar, and Tanzania 
on a world map. These are 
all countries in which Tech-
BridgeWorld has partners.
After these challenges 
were a number of poster pre-
sentations by the students of 
the course 15-239, Software 
Development for Social Good. 
“Last year, the course part-
nered with TechBridgeWorld 
and our existing projects to 
produce free and open-source 
software products of real and 
immediate value, from as-
sisting the blind to teaching 
English to migrant workers,” 
Teves said.
Students in this course 
are given the task of creating 
educational games for audi-
ences with speci?c types of 
needs. For example, sopho-
more computer science major 
Abdel Bourai, master’s stu-
dent in mechanical engineer-
ing Reese Deng, junior com-
puter science major Madeline 
Horowitz, and junior electri-
cal and computer engineer-
ing major Erik Pintar created 
the game Dream Explorer for 
students of the Western Penn-
sylvania School for the Deaf. 
The team designed their game 
using the knowledge that the 
deaf students were especially 
perceptive to spatial distanc-
es. In their game, the player 
had to explore a planet while 
looking for ?ying bats and 
were asked educational ques-
tions whenever a bat was 
captured.
Another group, whose 
members were senior comput-
er science majors Benjamin 
Choi and Isaac Lim and ju-
nior computer science majors 
Nivedita Chopra and Kechun 
Mao, is working with Reach 
Out To Asia (ROTA) to create 
a game for their Adult Eng-
lish Literacy program (RAEL). 
This game, called Jump!, was 
designed to teach English to 
migrant workers in Qatar and 
required the user to inter-
act with different characters 
in the game by ?lling in the 
blanks for incomplete sen-
tences using correct grammar. 
By answering these questions 
correctly, the user gains vari-
ous power-ups such as speed 
or higher jumping abilities. 
All of the 15-239 projects pre-
sented at TechBridgeWorld In-
teractive are still prototypes.
TechBridgeWorld is ground-
ed at a university that is a 
world leader in technology 
innovation and has partners 
all across the globe. With 
such a strong community be-
hind it, TechBridgeWorld has 
the potential to revolutionize 
technologies for communities 
in need, such as developing 
countries or individuals with 
disabilities.

Bone regeneration, the 
renewal of lost or damaged 
bone, is an important life pro-
cess, yet it can also be harm-
ful. Pathological bone often 
forms after orthopedic sur-
gery or amputation and can 
lead to further complications 
in recovery. Jeffrey Hollinger, 
professor of biological scienc-
es and biomedical engineer-
ing at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity, as well as the director 
of Carnegie Mellon’s Bone 
Tissue Engineering Center, is 
leading research to develop 
polymer-based treatments to 
eradicate pathological bone 
formation in soft tissue.
Despite his current posi-
tion, Hollinger did not always 
plan on a career in biomedi-
cal engineering. Originally 
studying to be a dentist, Hol-
linger joined the Army where 
he began in general dentistry 
and eventually worked in oral 
surgery at the Walter Reed 
Army Institute of Research 
(WRAIR).
Hollinger obtained his 
Ph.D. in oncology through 
the army, after which he be-
came the director of the bone 
program for the U.S. Army 
Institute of Dental Research. 
The team’s research involved 
disassembling bone and ana-
lyzing its structure. They de-
termined that bone contains 
organic and inorganic compo-
nents along with cells, and in-
vestigated the use of synthetic 
polymers seated with inorgan-
ic compounds.
Hollinger notes that much 
of their success came from 
the extensive funding they 
acquired. “We had money, 
we had people, and we had 
?ve thousand square feet of 
lab space,” Hollinger said. 
“Most of the ideas failed, but 
we published a lot and we 
were successful at getting De-
partment of Defense grants. I 
think I was dead and gone to 
heaven.”
After retiring from the 
Army, Hollinger moved to 
Oregon and worked as a pro-
fessor at the Oregon Health 
& Science University and 
the director of the North-
west Wound Healing Center. 
There, Hollinger continued 
his research with bone re-
generation. “We had grants 
from the National Institutes of 
Health, the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology, 
as well as corporate grants,” 
Hollinger said. “We worked 
with organic matrices. We had 
a strong organic chemistry 
group, as well as a strong inor-
ganic chemistry group.”
In 1999, Hollinger at-
tended a Gordon Research

Herbert A. Simon, one 
of the founders of Carnegie 
Mellon’s School of Com-
puter Science and winner of 
both the ACM Turing Award 
in 1975 and the Nobel Prize 
in Economics in 1978, said 
in a 1971 lecture that “in an 
information-rich world, the 
wealth of information means 
a dearth of something else: a 
scarcity of whatever it is that 
information consumes. What 
information consumes is 
rather obvious: it consumes 
the attention of its recipients. 
Hence a wealth of informa-
tion creates a poverty of at-
tention and a need to allo-
cate that attention ef?ciently 
among the overabundance 
of information sources that 
might consume it.” 
It was Simon’s work in the 
late 1960s and ’70s, when 
computer science was still a 
nascent ?eld, that inspired 
Bruno Ribeiro, a postdoctoral 
fellow in the School of Com-
puter Science, to research 
how social websites fare with 
respect to how much infor-
mation they produce versus 
consume.
In his paper, “Modeling 
and Predicting the Growth 
and Death of Membership-
based Websites,” Ribeiro cre-
ated a mathematical model 
that predicts the rise and fall 
of membership-based web-
sites, including Facebook and 
The Huf?ngton Post, as well 
as smaller, more niche sites 
like TeaPartyPatriots.org and 
OccupyWallSt.org.
“This idea started when 
I read this Herbert A. Simon 
lecture; he gave a lecture in 
1969 about the role that com-
puters play in what we call the 
‘market space of attention.’ At 
the time, people thought that 
computers were going to help 
them with the ’60s informa-
tion overload,” Ribeiro said 
in an interview. “A website 
keeps our attention only if it 
thinks more than it speaks; 
if it receives more attention 
than it gives others.”
According to the abstract 
of Ribeiro’s paper, his mod-
els rely on six years of in-
formation about the daily 
active users (DAU) for 22 
membership-based web-
sites, including “online so-
cial networks, grassroots 
movements, online forums, 
and membership-only Inter-
net stores — well balanced 
between successes and fail-
ures.” Ribeiro noted that his 
research looks at not just how 
many members these web-
sites have, but how many ac-
tive versus inactive members 
there are. “The model is more 
interested not in the number 
of users, but rather if they are 
active users or not. Nobody 
thinks that MySpace is a 
great website — it has many 
millions of users, too, but no 
one goes there.”
“Websites rely heavily 
on user-generated content,” 
Ribeiro said. “For instance, 
when you go on Facebook, 
you see what your friends did 
— you comment, you like, 
and then you can also share 
something. Facebook allows 
you to create content that 
captures a larger share of at-
tention from your friends, so 
they will also create content 
that captures a larger share 
of activity from you, creating 
a feedback loop of attention 
that attracts users.”
Ribeiro’s model relies on 
a complex series of reactions 
that describe mathematically 
how users interact with each 
other and attract new users 
through the content they gen-
erate. Ribeiro stressed that 
the success of membership-
based websites is heavily tied 
to how much attention users 
have to give to a website in 
relation to how much atten-
tion they are receiving from 
their friends and other users. 
“The attention that you’re 
willing to dedicate to Face-
book and other websites is a 
limited resource, and it will 
eventually stabilize,” Ribeiro 
said. “On the other hand, if 
your attention is less than 
the attention of your friends, 
this will create a negative 
slope that drives the website 
to its death.” Ribeiro’s paper 
predicts that Facebook has 
years of remaining popular-
ity, in direct contrast with the 
widely publicized Princeton 
University research paper, 
“Epidemiological Modeling 
of Online Social Network Dy-
namics,” by Ph.D. students in 
the university’s mechanical 
and aerospace engineering 
department John Cannarella 
and Joshua A. Spechler. They 
predicted the impending de-
cline of the social networking 
giant, which just celebrated 
its tenth anniversary. 
While Spechler and Can-
narella write in their paper 
that Facebook is “just begin-
ning to show the onset of 
an abandonment phase,” 
Ribeiro writes that “one of 
the most remarkable predic-
tions of our model is the long 
term stabilization of the DAU 
of self-sustaining websites,” 
including Facebook. Ribeiro 
hopes that his research can 
serve as a basis for further 
research on the interplay be-
tween membership-based web-
sites and social capital.
“Social capital,” Ribeiro 
said, “is a very vital and well-
studied area, a ?eld where 
the idea is that you can make 
people do things for you like 
with money or wealth, but 
not using money, just using 
social capital.”  
Ribeiro thinks that mem-
bership-based websites could 
use users’ desire for social 
capital to build their active 
user base. 
“A way to make sure you 
do something is to make 
sure you’re gaining if you 
do something [on the web-
site] and losing if you don’t. 
A great example is the way 
if a friend of yours posts 
something on Facebook, this 
person expects that you will 
help spread, or like, or do 
something about it to spread 
the news. In that sense, the 
website is using your social 
capital to generate activity.”
Ribeiro recommends that 
those who are interested 
in his research also look to 
Herbert Simon’s works. “It’s 
amazing; it really gives a 
sense of how to think about 
the future.”

PUGWASH COLUMNMilitary and surveillance drones have pros and cons
ROB MACEDO
Special to The Tartan
This week at Pugwash, the 
topic of discussion was drones 
— more speci?cally, the 
moral implications of using 
drones, or Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicles (UAVs), for military 
and surveillance purposes.
First discussed was the 
utility of drones. One argu-
ment is that drones lead to 
far lower civilian casualty 
rates. While foot soldiers can 
accidentally execute civilians 
during raids, a drone can di-
rectly target an enemy and 
avoid the confusion that may 
occur with ground soldiers. 
Additionally, drones do not 
have families, so losing a UAV 
is purely an economic issue, 
much different from losing 
a soldier. This positivism to-
ward UAVs caused an imme-
diate stir among Pugwash. 
Some members rebutted that 
a drone may be more algorith-
mic than a human, but it uses 
missiles to take out enemies. 
Thus, while a human can acci-
dentally kill a civilian located 
near a target, a drone would 
de?nitely kill every civilian 
near the target. In terms of 
preventing unnecessary civil-
ian casualties, this point does 
not make drones preferable.
Slate magazine quotes 
statistics which show that 
drones lead to less civilian ca-
sualties than ground soldiers, 
but these statistics cannot al-
ways be trusted because it is 
unclear in some cases who is 
considered a nearby civilian.
The ability to attach cam-
eras on drones poses another 
advantage. The cameras do 
not allow ?ghters to com-
mit atrocities without some 
form of video evidence be-
ing released. A human could 
remove a camera from their 
head before committing a 
terrible act, while a drone 
could not — that is, unless 
said drone was being con-
trolled by someone wishing 
to commit such atrocities. In 
this case, the use of the drone 
could make matters worse, as 
the human controller would 
have the ability to cause harm 
without having to experi-
ence such carnage in person. 
Would this detachment re-
duce the self-moral question-
ing that accompanies com-
mitting lethal acts in person? 
Is a drone the perfect type of 
killing machine?
Next, surveillance drones 
in the United States were 
discussed. The concern was 
raised that the propagation of 
such UAVs will lead to a soci-
ety where we are consistently 
being watched. 
Furthermore, unlike a se-
curity camera, a surveillance 
drone can follow people. Is 
this type of society one we 
want to inhabit, or is it a small 
price to pay in return for the 
propagation of a technol-
ogy that could deliver books 
to citizens through Amazon 
20 minutes after an order is 
placed? Additionally, an in-
crease in surveillance will 
reduce the possibility of be-
ing wrongly convicted of an 
action. It was discussed that 
if one is a good, law-abiding 
citizen, they should have 
nothing to hide. An objection 
was raised that there may be 
more justice, but there would 
be less forgiveness. If one 
makes a mistake, it is written 
in stone. This issue already 
occurs in the online world. 
Do we want to extend this 
hyper awareness to our physi-
cal world, or is this Orwellian 
utopia a nightmare?
As with many topics of 
Pugwash meetings, there was 
no de?nite answer to the ob-
jective morality of drones. 
However, there was a collec-
tively deeper understanding 
of the controversy surround-
ing UAVs.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational organi-
zation that meets on a weekly 
basis to discuss the implications 
of science, technology, and 
medicine in society. This article 
is a summary of last week’s dis-
cussion on drone regulation.

Region in the brain gives dogs ability to detect emotions
Researchers from Hungary 
may have uncovered part of 
the reason dogs seem so at-
tuned to our feelings. Speci?-
cally, scientists have identi?ed 
particular regions of the dog 
brain that may help dogs iden-
tify different emotions in our 
voices. This region works very 
similarly to the voice-detec-
tion device in human brains. 
For the experiments, dogs had 
their brains scanned by an MRI 
while listening to over 200 hu-
man voices and dog sounds.
Training dogs to sit still in 
a scanner for 10 minutes was 
an immense task in itself. Re-
searchers used typical train-
ing methods such as treats 
and praise, but also used more 
experienced dogs to serve 
as models for younger dogs. 
Once inside the MRI, the dogs 
had headphones that emitted 
noises from humans, dogs, 
and other objects like a phone. 
The ?ndings were published in 
Current Biology.

Deadly virus is spreading among British bumblebees
Honey bees may be the cul-
prit in the alarming rate of vi-
ral infections in Britain’s bum-
blebee population, according 
to a recent study published 
in Nature by Mark Brown and 
Matthias Fürst of the Univer-
sity of London.
Deformed wing virus 
(DWV) can be transmitted to 
bumblebees by two methods. 
Although DWV can be trans-
mitted between worker bees 
without issue, a mite can serve 
as a carrier and infect bee pu-
pae. Infection can result in 
young bees with severe defor-
mities, including bloated ab-
domens and crumpled wings.
Researchers believe the vi-
rus originally started in honey 
bee populations and then 
moved on to wild bumblebees; 
genetic analysis of the virus 
inside both species indicate 
that the virus is the same. The 
study found that the virus was 
found in 11 percent of wild 
bumblebees.

Solar DNA tests detect cancer without electricity
Engineers at Cornell Uni-
versity have developed a de-
vice that needs only sunlight, a 
smartphone, and a DNA sam-
ple to diagnose Kaposi’s sar-
coma, a common AIDS-related 
cancer. The device, called 
KS-Detect, is currently being 
tested in Uganda. Kaposi’s 
sarcoma is caused by a herpes 
virus and is tested in labora-
tories using polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), which detects 
the presence of the virus. PCR 
requires precise temperature 
conditions to work properly.
KS-Detect uses a special 
lens that captures the sun’s ray 
in a small disc of light where 
the edges are cooler than the 
center. The DNA sample moves 
through an etched channel in 
the devices and alternates be-
tween different temperatures. 
A special dye glows blue if 
there is detection of the herpes 
virus in the sample, and the at-
tached smartphone is able to 
read the results.

Elephants observed to show empathy toward each other
Although elephants have 
long been observed to show 
care toward each other, a re-
cent study con?rms the notion 
that elephants can express em-
pathy and even console each 
other. Researchers from Thai-
land and the United States 
compared elephants’ behavior 
during times of stress to times 
when little upset them. The 
researchers observed Asian el-
ephants in a large, 80-acre re-
serve in Thailand. They found 
that if an elephant was stressed 
by some outside cause — such 
as an angry elephant or a loud 
dog walking by — other el-
ephants would come over and 
soothe the worried elephant. 
These helper elephants would 
display similar emotions and 
caress the worried elephant 
with their trunks. Compar-
ing these stressful situations 
to a control, the researchers 
deduced that elephants can 
recognize distress in fellow 
elephants.

Iron de?ciency may be linked to higher chance of stroke
Recent ?ndings by sci-
entists from Imperial Col-
lege London indicate that an 
iron de?ciency — a condi-
tion which two billion people 
worldwide have — may in-
crease stroke risk by making 
the blood “stickier.” Scientists 
looked at blood samples of 
patients and found a correla-
tion between iron de?ciency 
and increased risk of stroke. 
Upon further examination of 
the platelets, they found that 
the platelets from low-iron 
individuals were much more 
likely to clump together under 
certain triggers.
The researchers believe 
this predisposition to clump-
ing may be one of the reasons 
for increased stroke risk, al-
though further research is re-
quired to con?rm this link. 
In the future, these re-
searchers hope to study 
whether the platelets will be-
come less sticky when the iron 
de?ciency is treated.

Europe to launch hunt for Earth-like exoplanets in 2024
The European Space Agen-
cy has recently announced 
the Planetary Transits and 
Oscillations of stars (PLATO) 
mission, which is intended 
to discover more Earthlike 
exoplanets. 
PLATO will begin in 2024 
and will endeavor to ?nd hun-
dreds of rocky planets in habit-
able zones. PLATO will utilize 
the transmit method, which 
looks at the dimming light of 
a star once a planet is in front 
of it. This process can be time 
consuming because it requires 
the observation of many stars. 
To bypass this issue, PLATO 
will use 34 smaller telescopes 
in order to have a large ?eld of 
view.
The mission will be 
launched from French Guiana 
and will operate approximate-
ly 1.5 million kilometers from 
Earth.

Hollinger starts out in the Army and ends up in academia 
Conference — a prestigious, 
international scienti?c con-
ference — at the Holderness 
School in New Hampshire and 
was invited to give a seminar 
at Carnegie Mellon on tissue 
engineering.
 “I had never heard the 
term tissue engineer before 
... I don’t consider myself an 
engineer,” Hollinger said. 
Hollinger explained that his 
seminar, despite being geared 
more toward medical stu-
dents, still contained engi-
neering concepts. “I explained 
how we took apart bone and 
discovered it was made of 
collagen, an inorganic com-
ponent, and cells. I think it 
resonated with them because 
engineers take things apart to 
make them work better.” Af-
ter his lecture, Hollinger was 
offered a position at Carn-
egie Mellon as a professor of 
biological sciences and bio-
medical engineering. “I had 
never worked with engineers 
before,” Hollinger said. “It 
took some getting used to.”
Today, Hollinger is part of 
a research team at Carnegie 
Mellon that is responsible for 
investigating ways to pre-
vent heterotopic ossi?cation, 
the formation of bone tissue 
outside the skeleton. The re-
searchers are investigating 
the use of nanostructured 
polymer composites, small 
structures made of multiple 
components, to deliver unique 
RNA into cells where hetero-
topic ossi?cation occurs.
The research has many po-
tential applications, namely 
with regards to amputation 
and bone trauma. Heterotopic 
ossi?cation is highly prevalent 
in military personnel who sus-
tain bone injuries or require 
amputations, as well as civil-
ians who have major surger-
ies such as hip replacement 
operations. In these instances, 
it can cause pain and discom-
fort at the site of injury. The 
elimination of heterotopic 
ossi?cation could improve re-
covery in patients who under-
go these types of procedures 
due to bone trauma.
Although Hollinger did not 
originally intend to conduct 
the research he does now, he 
has the potential to greatly af-
fect the future of bone trauma 
treatment. “It is really the 
work of my students,” Hol-
linger said. “I have had terri?c 
students from undergraduate 
to graduate … it has been the 
highlight of my career.”

Time is a relative concept 
— a human invention created 
to keep track of our existence. 
In a universe that is approxi-
mately 13.6 billion years old, 
for an Olympic athlete, milli-
seconds of the universe’s ex-
istence can be the difference 
between achieving life-long 
dreams and disappointment.
Last week in Sochi, the dif-
ference between gold and sil-
ver at the 2014 Winter Olym-
pics men’s 1500-meter speed 
skating event was a remark-
able .003 seconds, accord-
ing to BBC. Measuring races 
with this extreme precision is 
a daunting task that is made 
possible by state-of-the-art 
technology.
Omega SA, a Swiss luxury 
watchmaker, is the of?cial 
timekeeper of the Olympics 
for the 26th time. Using new 
technology in a three-part 
system, this company aims to 
ensure that the true winners 
will be standing on the po-
dium at the end of the races.
Timing Olympic races can 
be complicated. As racers line 
up at the starting line, they 
eagerly wait for a visual or au-
ditory cue to begin the race.
As described in the Smith-
sonian magazine, the ancient 
Greeks had a system of ropes, 
one at the racers’ knees and 
the other at waist level that 
would be dropped one af-
ter another signaling to the 
racer that the race was start-
ing. Surprisingly, this system 
would have been fairly suc-
cessful in preventing a racer 
from jumping the gun — or in 
this case, the rope.
In 1948, the traditional 
gun loaded with blanks to 
start the race was connected 
to an electronic system that 
launched a laser beam across 
the starting line which would 
be triggered by an athlete’s 
movement and was accu-
rate to one thousandth of a 
second.
However, the traditional 
gunshot sound used to start 
races reaches each racer at 
different times, giving the 
nearest athlete an unfair ad-
vantage of a fraction of a frac-
tion of a second.
According to BBC, last 
week in the men’s 1500-meter 
speed skating event, Poland’s 
Zbigniew Bródka and Koen 
Verweij of the Netherlands 
both crossed the ?nish line at 
one minute, 45 seconds ?at. 
However, after a closer look, 
Bródka was awarded the gold 
for ?nishing .003 faster.
In these situations, accord-
ing to Omega SA, they have 
developed a three-part sys-
tem to always determine the 
correct winner. When the race 
is started, a sound is played, a 
light ?ash is emitted, and a 
start pulse is given to the tim-
ing device — all simultane-
ously. Racers wear incredibly 
lightweight electronic sensors 
called transponders on their 
legs to accurately record their 
times. Throughout the race, 
these transponders provide 
data of the racer’s distance 
and time.
At the end of the track 
there are two photoelectric 
cells similar to lasers that 
must both be triggered by 
the athlete’s skates to re-
cord the ?nishing time. This 
data is combined with a 
Scan’O’Vision photo-?nish

Inclusive Facebook gender options get a like
In a daring and progressive move, 
Facebook recently unveiled more 
than 50 customizable terms for us-
ers to label their gender. Previously, 
users had been limited to the gen-
der binary of male or female, as well 
as the option to refuse answering 
altogether. 
Now, users have their pick of 
terms with which to identify, in-
cluding variations upon transgen-
der, gender?uid, genderqueer, and 
agender. Each person is also given 
a choice of preferred pronoun: his, 
hers, or theirs. For a social media 
giant, this step is unprecedented in 
support of the trans* community 
that should be celebrated, despite 
certain drawbacks.
Facebook’s new gender options 
are an enormous victory for the 
trans* — and, by extension, the LG-
BTQ — community. According to 
ABC News, Facebook software en-
gineer and out trans woman Brielle 
Harrison has stated, “There’s going 
to be a lot of people for whom this 
is going to mean nothing, but for 
the few it does impact, it means the 
world.”
This statement couldn’t be more 
apt. With the highest rates of vio-
lent discrimination and attempted 
suicide in the LGBT community, “T” 
remains the most stigmatized letter 
of the acronym, according to Slate 
Magazine. Considering this extreme 
prejudice, the number of people who 
identify under the trans* umbrella is 
dif?cult, if not impossible, to accu-
rately measure. To a trans* minority, 
however, being free to self-identify 
on such a major social media site will 
be invaluable.
Additionally, Facebook’s decision 
to recognize non-cisgender identities 
could encourage people to educate 
themselves about the gender spec-
trum. It is more important now than 
ever to raise public awareness and 
acceptance of gender identities out-
side of the traditional binary. Other 
social media venues would do well 
to follow in Facebook’s example and 
not simply by including the ambigu-
ous “other” in their list of options.
Of course, the company has gar-
nered criticism for its decision. As 
must be true with any progressive 
step forward, some have criticized 
Facebook for going too far in blur-
ring the lines of gender; others 
counter that Facebook didn’t go far 
enough. From a practical standpoint, 
expanding gender options may com-
plicate censuses and directed adver-
tising, just by virtue of there being 
more variables. 
However, the trans* community 
shows that anything that divides the 
world into man versus woman is ter-
ribly limited in the ?rst place.
Academia must be made accessible to public
Last Tuesday, Carnegie Mellon 
hosted its ?rst ever Three-Minute 
Thesis competition. The contest 
challenged Ph.D. students from mul-
tiple disciplines to distill the essence 
of their theses into three-minute pre-
sentations to give to an audience of 
non-specialists and be judged.
The Three-Minute competition, 
besides being an interesting venue 
for members of the campus commu-
nity to see the research being con-
ducted by graduate students, also 
hints at a larger problem facing aca-
demia at the moment: accessibility.
Public perception has never been 
kind toward academics. Professors 
and Ph.D. candidates have often 
been viewed as closed off, working 
on projects that can’t be explained 
without a seminar course on the 
jargon of their subject area. This dis-
tance between academia and the rest 
of our society has proven to be more 
damaging than bene?cial.
America has a long-held grudge 
against academic culture. In our 
elections, we tend to value the tri-
umphs of the common man while 
underplaying the accomplishments 
of the educated. 
For a long period of our history, 
the highest level of education one 
could reasonably expect was a high 
school diploma, which may have 
contributed to a sense of disdain to-
ward those who had the good for-
tune and opportunity to further their 
studies. 
Now, with rising standards of 
education and national and global 
problems which require the backing 
of scienti?c research and investiga-
tion to solve, this distance must be 
eliminated. Academics must work 
to break down the barriers between 
them and the public, and members 
of the public must be willing to ac-
cept this.
Of course, there are highly scien-
ti?c and mathematical topics which 
are dif?cult to discuss with those 
outside of the ?eld. However, as a 
whole, academia should focus on be-
coming more inclusive, rather than 
exclusive. 
The Tartan encourages initiatives 
such as the Three-Minute Thesis 
competition that work to soften the 
divide, making technological inno-
vation and scienti?c progress acces-
sible to the general public. It is only 
through this shift in rhetoric and 
attitude that we can work on mak-
ing meaningful differences for our 
society.
It has always been the goal of the 
Olympic games to overcome divides 
in international politics and at least 
for two weeks develop a spirit of in-
ternational cooperation and unity. 
Why, then, is it that NBC contin-
ues to be allowed to marginalize a 
large swath of the American popula-
tion by limiting access to this inter-
national event? NBC’s decision to 
require a cable subscription to view 
the games means that many are not 
able to join the international com-
munity in enjoying them. This disad-
vantages  lower socioeconomic class 
families who cannot afford a cable 
subscription, as well as a population 
of young adults who increasingly 
turn to the Internet over television. 
Preventing certain demograph-
ics from watching the Olympics 
seems to contradict the mission of 
the games and therefore begs the 
question: why does the international 
Olympics committee allow this prac-
tice to continue? 
NBC makes some of its coverage 
available online and supplements it 
with advertisements; why can’t this 
practice be adapted to all coverage?
People love to gather around a 
game. Nothing has made this socio-
logical phenomenon more evident 
than Twitch Plays Pokémon, a move-
ment in which people across campus 
and across the world have been com-
ing together to root for their favorite 
childhood video game. 
This kind of response is exactly 
what the Olympics are supposed to 
be about: the coming together of 
different groups over the love of the 
game. If the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) was truly commit-
ted to this goal, they would place 
stricter regulations on those net-
works given the right to broadcast. 
Why the networks covering the 
Olympic Games don’t embrace the 
success of live streaming events on-
line is an enigma. It has become clear 
through the runaway popularity of 
Twitch Plays Pokémon that people in 
our age demographic will gather to-
gether to watch and socialize around 
free online streams. 
The IOC should promote the use 
of online video to promote the goals 
of community upheld by the Olym-
pics. Offering access to those with-
out cable subscriptions, even in an 
ad-supported form, would be a large 
step toward achieving that goal. 
The best way to achieve the in-
ternational unity that the Olympic 
games strive for is to make coverage 
of the events easily accessible to ev-
eryone. But in the mean time we can 
all watch Pidgeot go for gold. 
NBC misses the gold with Olympics coverage
Ukraine unrest reeks ofRussian interventionism
JUSTIN YAN
In the Feb. 2 issue of The Tartan, 
I wrote an article entitled “Ukraine 
must join EU to ease unrest” about 
the anti-government protests, pop-
ularly called Euromaidan, raging 
through the streets of Ukraine’s cap-
ital city of Kiev.
In the two weeks since that ar-
ticle was published, a lot has hap-
pened: the Sochi Olympics, the Kiev 
police’s use of live rounds, a truce af-
ter the deaths of scores of protesters, 
a subsequent uneasy truce between 
the government and the opposition 
parties, the breaking of that truce, 
President Obama’s unexpected 
personal condemnation of Russian 
President Vladimir Putin, European 
Union sanctions in Ukraine, and — 
on Saturday — a successful coup 
against Ukrainian President Viktor 
Yanukovych that has left the na-
tion’s future leadership in question.
According to Time magazine, 
fresh ?ghting broke out on Feb. 20 
across the Maidan Square, where 
much of the ground has been blown 
to rubble. Any Google image search 
will yield a public square resembling 
a war zone. 70 protestors were re-
ported dead as of Thursday. The 
protesters seemed to be adamant 
even in the face of death.
Former heavyweight champion 
boxer and current leader of the 
Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for 
Reform, Vitali Klitschko, has called 
for early presidential elections to 
force reform through a new execu-
tive leader. The Ukranian parlia-
ment seems to have listened to 
Klitschko, as they have declared Ya-
nukovych constitutionally un?t for 
duty and have established a May 25 
election for his replacement, accord-
ing to kyivpost.com.
However, even if recent events 
signal that Yanukovych is out of the 
picture, the opposition parties — 
for which Klitschko appears to be a 
?gurehead — are by no means uni-
?ed. They contain nationalists and 
radical factionalists seeking total 
government reform, as well as more 
moderate politicians seeking unity.
There has been much confusion 
surrounding the upcoming elec-
tions, with Yanukovych ?eeing the 
capital to the more pro-Russian east-
ern border of Ukraine. Yanukovych 
later appeared on television, stating 
“I do not intend to resign. I am the 
legitimately elected president,” ac-
cording to Time magazine.
With this announcement, the 
streets once again descended into 
chaos, with protesters chanting 
“Ukraine is not Russia”. Finally, for-
mer Ukrainian prime minister and 
archrival of Yanukovych — Yulia Ty-
moshenko — was freed after years 
in prison following a controversial 
court case. Thus, another key power 
player has entered the fray. Especial-
ly concerning is that Tymoshenko 
is in a separate political party than 
Klitschko, which could place the 
leaders in opposite corners if a pow-
er vacuum arises. The very question 
of Ukraine’s unity — beyond re-
gional preferences for the European 
Union (EU) over Russia or vice versa 
— has been thrown into the air.
On Thursday, President Barack 
Obama said, “Our approach in the 
United States is not to see these [is-
sues] as some cold war chessboard 
in which we’re in competition with 
Russia,” according to The Guardian. 
Despite President Obama’s state-
ment, the events in Ukraine and 
subsequent actions by other nations 
are all skirmishes revolving around 
the chessboard of international poli-
tics. All around, intricate moves are 
being pushed into play.
Unlike the Cold War, this chess 
match isn’t a clash of democracy 
and communism; however, it is still 
a clash of ideology — power for the 
government versus power for the 
people. 
Ukraine is a curious state, both 
in its demographics and geography. 
Ukraine, with 45.5 million citizens, 
is the seventh most populous coun-
try in Europe. Additionally, it is situ-
ated on the Black Sea and occupies 
a sizable coastline. It clearly has the 
potential, in manpower and natural 
resources, to be an economic power-
house in Eastern Europe. Russia sees 
this potential, as does the EU, and so 
there exists a tug of war between the 
two for in?uence over the nation.
According to The Telegraph, it is 
no secret that much of the corrup-
tion that Ukraine is rife with, in-
cluding Yanukovych’s unnaturally 
long reign, has been due to Russian 
meddling. Putin, as proud and ag-
gressive as ever, is mounting one 
?nal push to make his EU counter-
parts lose hope of gaining Ukraine 
as an ally. Russia consumes the ma-
jority of Ukrainian trade and bailed 
Ukraine out of bankruptcy back in 
December. Ukraine’s survival during 
the past year has been dependent 
on its Eastern neighbor. Russia has 
taken advantage of a large — albeit 
unstable — state and maneuvered 
itself into being Ukraine’s biggest 
client and, at some points, ally.
Putin is not surprised at the vio-
lence of Euromaidan — especially 
since much of his foreign policy has 
contributed to it. Moreover, it is no 
coincidence that much of this Rus-
sian aggression has occurred with 
the Sochi Olympics. Russian law-
makers have been using media at-
tention from the games as a screen 
for their conduct in Ukraine.
What does this accomplish for 
Putin and Russia? First, Putin’s capi-
tal in?ows into Ukraine have effec-
tively frozen any sort of Association 
Agreement, or trade deal, with the 
EU. Yanukovych’s rejection of such 
an agreement was what ?rst incited 
the protests. Second, Putin has re-
stored Ukraine back into its realm of 
in?uence, which imploded after the 
Soviet Union fragmented and start-
ed to diminish once again leading up 
to the failed Association Agreement.
Moreover, there is no better way 
for Russia to defend its interests 
against its foe, the United States. By 
exerting its in?uence over Ukraine, 
Russia staves off the creation of a 
pro-U.S. and Western region.
There have been calls for West-
ern nations to impose sanctions and 
?nancial bans on Russia, effectively 
strangling Russian capital ?ows. Un-
fortunately, not only are assets hard 
to track on such a large scale, but 
such sanctions would lead to even 
greater tensions between Russia and 
the EU with the United States. 
All in all, Russia has been tugging 
strings carefully throughout the So-
chi Olympics to protect its interests 
and increase its power outside of 
Moscow. For now, Ukraine teeters 
back into stability. Perhaps after the 
elections — assuming they are con-
ducted fairly — Ukraine will be able 
to stand by itself with less in?uence 
from Russia.

A PERSON’S OPINION
February 24, 2014 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
The Tartan enjoyed a taste of Spring this week. So we asked,
What are you going to do when the weather gets nicer?
Compiled by Sara Remi Fields
Streaming means indie artists go broke
KYLE HENSON
It’s a well-documented fact that 
artists don’t get paid well for music 
that people stream online. The ac-
tual magnitude of this problem was 
recently made more public when 
alternative rock group Camper Van 
Beethoven released a picture of their 
royalty check. One of their songs got 
played over a million times and their 
payout was a bit more than $16. That 
should be astounding to everyone.
As an amateur musician in a band 
myself, I can attest to the amount of 
time and energy artists put into cre-
ating songs. I’ve sat for hours listen-
ing to my singer record 121 takes on 
a vocal track because he wasn’t satis-
?ed with his performance. Imagine 
that process repeated over the 20-30 
tracks that professionally produced 
songs have. It’s an absolutely labori-
ous process. Bands will often spend 
months in the studio trying to per-
fect their sound.
Then, when tracks ?nally get out 
of the studio, some poor soul has to 
sit there mixing for hours and hours 
on end. Mixers will listen to the same 
song thousands of times, often sit-
ting alone in a windowless room late 
at night, slowly watching their sanity 
slip into effect inserts and automa-
tion data to make the artists sound 
the way they want to.
After mixing is ?nally done, the 
track has to be mastered. Now the 
process is even more nuanced and 
delicate, because changing the decay 
on your reverb effect by less than a 
tenth of a second will drastically al-
ter the way the track sounds. That’s 
why albums usually take upward of 
ten months to go from a songwriter’s 
ideas to serenading ears.
Imagine putting all that love 
and care into something, and then 
having it turn out really well. It’s 
popular, people want it, they use it 
one million times, and — after ev-
erything — you only get $16. That’s 
nuts. President Obama is pushing for 
higher minimum wage laws to nomi-
nally help low-skilled workers, but 
these laws will mainly help to boost 
the salaries of union workers, since 
union wages are often calculated as 
a multiple of the minimum wage. 
But union workers have an aver-
age hourly pay rate of $23.75. In an 
hour, they make almost 150 percent 
of what Pandora pays an artist for 
streaming one million songs.
While I don’t want to minimize 
the positive effect that Pandora and 
other streaming services have had on 
making discovery of new music more 
accessible, they have to start paying 
artists a bit more for use of their in-
tellectual property. As streaming be-
comes more popular and increasing-
ly few people buy music — instead 
opting for Spotify — artists aren’t go-
ing to earn a decent living from their 
music. Indie bands could possibly be 
a dying breed, leaving us only with 
music that record labels heavily sub-
sidize and promote, which would be 
a terrible state of affairs for the qual-
ity and diversity of music.
A friend of mine is an incredibly 
talented musician who has taken 
to simply giving his music away. He 
told me that it was basically impos-
sible to make any money from online 
distribution, so the best he can do is 
get more music in more people’s ears 
so that they pay for his live show. We 
don’t need to leave talented artists 
behind like this. The music indus-
try needs to ?nd a way to get artists 
more money from the online distri-
bution of their intellectual property.

Giving America a raise is highly 
controversial these days. The cur-
rent federal minimum wage is $7.25 
per hour. Democrats wish to raise it 
to $10.10 by 2016. Republicans, true 
to recent form, are rejecting the pro-
posal outright.
A wall of partisan noise has 
drowned out the economic facts 
underpinning this proposal. Let’s 
review them. The Congressional 
Budget Of?ce (CBO) states that 
this hike in the minimum wage will 
boost earnings for about 24.5 mil-
lion Americans over the next three 
years. Consequently, nearly one mil-
lion Americans will escape poverty.
However, the hike will also cost 
another half a million Americans 
their jobs, according to the CBO. 
This statistic has Republicans in-
censed. 
They argue that the govern-
ment’s imposition of a higher mini-
mum wage on the marketplace — 
essentially, a higher base price for 
labor — will increase the prices of 
goods and services. Consumers will 
then buy less. Consequently, busi-
nesses will have to ?re low-wage 
workers in order to maintain their 
pro?t margins. Additionally, in some 
industries, the higher price of labor 
will incentivize businesses to auto-
mate those jobs, decreasing hiring.
Republicans propose, instead, 
the Earned Income Tax Credit 
(EITC). It incentivizes low-wage 
workers to seek work instead of 
welfare by giving them a taxpayer 
subsidy to lift them out of poverty. 
Unlike the federal minimum wage, 
however, the EITC does not use the 
muscle of the federal government 
to arm low-wage workers with bar-
gaining power when they try to in-
crease this wage. 
Additionally, economists warn 
that for every 10 percent increase 
in the EITC, high-school educated 
workers lose 2 percent in wages, ac-
cording to a report published by the 
Brookings Institution. This conse-
quence occurs because the EITC en-
courages more Americans to work, 
thus keeping the cost of labor low. 
The EITC is a good ?rst step, but 
should be implemented alongside 
an increase in the federal minimum 
wage, which would counteract the 
reduction in wages created by a 
higher EITC.
Democrats are buoyed by the 
prospect of lessening poverty and 
reducing income inequality. Com-
mon sense dictates that improving 
the lives of 24.5 million Americans 
— a million of them dramatically — 
far outweighs the predicted loss of 
half a million minimum-wage jobs.
In fact, Democrats respond in 
two ways to that prediction.
First, they argue that a predicted 
loss of 500,000 jobs is not certain. 
Twenty years of economic data, 
gleaned from comparing states that 
raised their minimum wages above 
the federal level to states that did 
not, suggest that business own-
ers do not automatically respond 
to a higher minimum wage by lay-
ing off workers and not hiring new 
ones. Rather, they pay these higher 
minimum wages from the money 
they save from reduced labor turn-
over, higher productivity, and a 
slowdown in wage increases higher 
up the scale. As Secretary of Labor 
Thomas Perez explained to report-
ers at the White House, the Ameri-
can economy shall gain “the ef?cien-
cies of paying a fair wage.”
Second, Democrats argue that 
a higher minimum wage will boost 
demand across the economy. The 
more low-wage workers will earn, 
the more they will spend. Greater 
demand for goods and services 
will create more well-paying jobs. 
This effect is the Henry Ford effect. 
Ford doubled the daily wage of his 
workers to $5 so they could buy a 
Model T. In doing so, he sparked the 
rise of the American middle class. 
Democrats call on business owners 
to embrace this logic and join them 
in pushing for a higher minimum 
wage. Even if hiking the minimum 
wage sheds 500,000 jobs, unem-
ployed Americans will quickly ?nd 
higher-paying jobs.
A recent Pew Research Cen-
ter poll found that 73 percent of 
Americans, including 53 percent 
of Republicans, supported raising 
the minimum wage from $7.25 to 
$10.10. Our social contract asserts 
that if we work hard, we should be 
able to put a roof over our heads, 
food on the table, and clothes on our 
backs. The current federal minimum 
wage translates to an annual income 
of $15,080. This income is a state 
of poverty, and no one who works 
a full-time job should live in a state 
of poverty. It is time America got a 
raise.
Sochi cannot afford high-roller attitude
BRANDON SCHMUCK
The Olympics are meant to be a 
time during which the world puts its 
differences aside and comes togeth-
er in a joyous manner to celebrate 
healthy competition. However, as 
the ?nal whispers of this year’s So-
chi Olympics die down, many ques-
tions are being raised concerning the 
corruption associated with history’s 
most expensive Games.
According to The Huf?ngton Post, 
this year’s Winter Games have cost 
upward of $50 billion — a cost high-
er than that of all previous Winter 
Olympics combined. For a country 
with signi?cant economic problems 
and government expenditures of 
only $376.2 billion in 2011, this vast 
spending is concerning.
With this high-roller attitude, 
Russia is trying to impress the world 
and hide the fact that it is still a de-
veloping nation. It has tried to hide 
its issues with shiny, state-of-the-art 
complexes, but members of the me-
dia are quickly discovering many of 
the problems faced by Sochi’s citi-
zens that Russia has been unable to 
cover.
As The Huf?ngton Post describes, 
many journalists entered their ho-
tels only to ?nd half-?nished build-
ings. In some hotels, the water was a 
bright yellow hue and clearly unsafe 
to drink. Journalist for Canadian 
publication The Globe and Mail Mark 
MacKinnon even tweeted, “Ok, so 
my hotel doesn’t have a lobby yet.” 
Though many rooms did not contain 
heat, Internet, or other basic com-
modities, each did offer an authori-
tarian portrait of Russian President 
Vladimir Putin.
Sochi bid its spot for the Olym-
pics quoting an estimated budget 
of $12 billion. How has its budget 
more than quadrupled since to $51 
billion?
As it turns out, the most expen-
sive games in Olympics history may 
also be the most corrupt. According 
to Business Insider, as much as $30 
billion may have been stolen from 
the “already in?ated budget.” 
According to Russian opposition 
?gures Boris Nemtsov and Leonid 
Martynyuk, Putin funneled contracts 
to many of his friends, causing the 
Olympics’ sports complexes to be 
built without competitive offers. 
Nemtsov describes this embezzle-
ment as “a real threat to Russia’s na-
tional security.”
The fact that half of the budget 
may have been stolen represents 
much of the corruption the Russian 
government still faces in the post-
Soviet era. Add to this the anti-gay 
propaganda laws enacted by Russia 
before the games, and the 2014 So-
chi Winter Olympics has turned out 
to be one of the most controversial 
games in history.
Despite the controversy, the fact 
that Russia held this year’s games 
may encourage closer ties with the 
United States and other Western na-
tions — a welcome accomplishment 
in this post-Cold War age. However, 
while Russia has come far from its 
Soviet Union decline, it stills faces 
many of the issues of a developing 
nation. 
Russia’s international affairs 
may have bene?ted greatly from the 
Olympics, but by spending extrava-
gant amounts of money on sports 
complexes when its citizens are in 
poverty, the nation has turned away 
from helping the people within its 
borders.

These two personnel choic-
es have paid off handsomely 
for Madrid, as they give the 
team a liberty in tactics which 
was previously not available. 
When attacking, Madrid 
can play as a 4-3-3 but a de 
facto 4-1-2-3 with di María 
and Modric pushing up and 
Alonso holding fort or spray-
ing long balls out wide. It 
gives the team greater attack-
ing impetus, while also freeing 
up the wingers to try and beat 
their man on the outside rath-
er than cutting in, something 
which Ronaldo, Bale, and Jesé 
are very capable of doing. 
With two players in the cen-
tral positions, the cutting in of 
the wingers to take a shot on 
goal also has a renewed sur-
prise effect, especially since 
each of the mid?eld three, as 
well as Ronaldo, and Bale have 
fantastic long shots.
When it comes to defend-
ing, di María makes a huge 
difference. When playing a 
4-2-3-1, the number 10 and 
the striker are not expected to 
track back, while the wingers 
are. However, with Ronaldo 
being on the left wing and 
not a player who likes to play 
through the middle, it tends 
to leave three players up front 
and Madrid becomes 
vulnerable. 
To rectify this problem, 
when defending, Ancelotti 
changes the formation of his 
team from a 4-3-3 to a 4-4-
2, with Ronaldo switching 
to a secondary striker and di 
María manning the left ?ank. 
Di María’s incessant running 
puts pressure on the opposi-
tion and the winger on the 
other ?ank is expected to do 
the same. 
This results in deadly coun-
ter attacks when possession is 
won back, similar to the light-
ning-speed counters seen dur-
ing the league-title-winning 
season under Mourinho. 
The defensive stability pro-
vided by the extra man behind 
the ball means there is less 
pressure on Modric and Alon-
so to do the dirty work, and 
they can shield the back much 
better. 
This strategy has had ex-
traordinary results in 2014. 
Madrid have played a total of 
14 games this year, winning 
all but one of them — a cred-
itable 1–1 draw with Athletic 
Bilbao, a team that has not lost 
at home this season — and 
with just three goals conceded 
overall. 
The defensive pairing of 
central defenders Sergio Ra-
mos and Pepe has blossomed 
again, and the full backs have 
been rotated so effectively 
that it rarely even matters 
which one steps out on the 
pitch these days. 
With the impending return 
of young defender Raphaël 
Varane, the Madrid defense is 
only going to get stronger. The 
biggest trickle-down effect of 
this tactic has been that Ma-
drid ?nally have a blueprint on 
how to approach games. 
When squad rotation 
comes into play, the basic tac-
tics and positions are already 
laid out for the role players, 
such as Isco and Illaramendi. 
Madrid have conceded no 
goals in cup competitions this 
season as a result, with goal-
keeper Iker Casillas showing 
his pre-2013 form again. Atlé-
tico Madrid, who had beaten 
Real Madrid at the Santiago 
Bernabéu Stadium in the 
league again earlier this sea-
son, were soundly thrashed 
5–0 over two legs in the cup, 
with Jesé scoring in both legs 
of that matchup.
Jesé has been a revelation 
since the start of the year, 
deputizing superbly for Bale, 
and even making his own case 
to be a starter in the team. His 
scoring form has been phe-
nomenal, with him scoring at 
nearly a goal a game for a part 
of January. 
Ancelotti has not been 
afraid to use talented players 
from Castilla, such as Álvaro 
Morata in the earlier stages 
of the season when Benzema 
was slacking, and now Jesé, in 
light of Bale’s injury and Ron-
aldo’s subsequent suspension. 
Over the last two months, 
Jesé has been the starting 
winger for Madrid in every 
game and, while his game 
time is likely to diminish now 
that Bale is back and Ronaldo 
has completed his suspension, 
he has given Ancelotti a wel-
come selection headache, able 
backup and ?repower on the 
bench, and a new dimension 
for his team’s attack. 
Jesé is a player capable of 
playing either on the wing or 
as a lone striker, due to his ex-
ceptional ability with the ball 
and his superb ?nishing. He 
seems to be the natural suc-
cessor to Ronaldo a few years 
down the line and could be-
come the next striker Raúl of 
Real Madrid, a homegrown 
legend.
Ancelotti’s Madrid in 2014 
have been nothing short of 
sensational, and with Cham-
pions League now returning, 
it remains to be seen whether 
he can accomplish the goal set 
out for him at the beginning of 
the season — to bring home La 
Decima. 
Madrid are entering top 
gear as the business end of the 
season approaches — they are 
in the Copa del Ray ?nal and 
have a three-point lead at the 
top of the table. It’s getting 
harder to bet against this team 
winning every competition 
there is this winter.

Men’s and women’s basketball teams face off at UChicago
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Bas-
ketball teams went on the road 
this week to face University of 
Chicago in a Friday women’s 
and men’s doubleheader. The 
Tartans went 1–1 on the eve-
ning with the men coming 
within two seconds of a Carn-
egie Mellon sweep.
The women started the 
matchup and held steady with 
the Maroons through the ?rst 
half. For the ?rst 10 minutes, 
the Tartans were playing an 
in-and-out offense with all of 
their points coming on layups, 
free throws or three-point 
shots. Senior guard Jacquie 
Shaw started to open up the 
game, giving the Tartans a 
four-point lead about four 
minutes in on an easy transi-
tion layup and foul, with the 
additional free throw making 
it a two possession game.
This run was quickly an-
swered by a Maroons three-
pointer, and the score was 
stuck at 14–13 for the next 
several minutes as both teams 
missed shots and suffered 
from turnovers. In an attempt 
to get things going, the Ma-
roons implemented an unusu-
al full-team substitution with 
all ?ve players on the court 
going to the bench. This did 
not have the desired effect, as 
both teams were still mired in 
poor shooting and sloppy ball 
handling.
Both offenses ?nally start-
ed showing signs of life in the 
later stages of the ?rst half, 
with the Maroons opening up 
a ?ve-point lead after back-
to-back three-pointers only to 
be answered later by back-to-
back three-pointers by junior 
guard Gabrielle West. 
After another layup and 
one from Shaw, West followed 
up with two more quick threes 
to stretch the Tartan lead to 
six. The Maroons pulled back 
to within one with under 30 
seconds to go in the half after 
a layup and their own three-
pointer, but West drilled her 
?fth three-pointer of the half 
with under two seconds to 
go to give Carnegie Mellon a 
41–37 lead going into the half.
Coming out of half, the Tar-
tans extended their lead with 
early points from ?rst-year 
center-forward Lisa Murphy 
and junior forward Liza Otto. 
Junior guard Chandler Cau-
?eld and West each hit a three-
pointer to give the Tartans 
their ?rst double-digit lead.
The Maroons continued 
their rapid-?re, three-point of-
fense, hitting three straight to 
keep the game within reach. 
The Tartans kept up with the 
blistering pace, keeping the 
lead until two minutes were 
left in the game when a pair 
of Maroons free throws ?nally 
tied up the game.
They pulled out an 84–77 
victory with the help of ?ve of 
six free-throw shooting down 
the stretch from Shaw and 
Otto. West’s torrid three-point 
shooting tied her own school 
record as she ?nished with 
seven made three-pointers 
and a team-leading 23 points.
For the men, the road trip 
was a good chance to clear 
their head, at least to start 
the game. Fourteen points by 
junior forward-guard Seth 
Cordts, including four three-
pointers in the ?rst nine min-
utes, helped the Tartans open 
up a fast double-digit lead.
Chicago started pulling 
back in with a three-pointer 
and a powerful dunk, but 
back-to-back threes by ?rst-
year forward Jack Serbin and 
senior guard Rashaun Riley 
pushed the lead back to 10. A 
series of layups by senior for-
ward-guard Christian Mano-
li gave Carnegie Mellon a 
14-point lead with under three 
minutes to play in the half.
The Maroons tried to close 
the lead, but a three-point shot 
by senior guard Asad Meghani 
and another Manoli free throw 
gave the Tartans a 42–38 lead 
going into half time.
Chicago came out on ?re, 
forcing several bad Carn-
egie Mellon free throws and 
quickly cutting the lead to ?ve. 
Manoli and Cordts continued 
carrying the team as they com-
bined for nine points for the 
Tartans coming out of the half 
and managed to push the lead 
back to 10.
The turning point for the 
Tartans was a foul and subse-
quent technical foul by junior 
center-forward Matt Loeb-
baka. Loebbaka has shown a 
bit of a temper this season and 
had his passion spill out on to 
the court on more than one oc-
casion. This time it really cost 
Carnegie Mellon as Chicago 
hit four free throws and used 
this swing in momentum to ?-
nally mount their second-half 
charge.
The Tartans interior de-
fense fell after this point as 
they gave up easy layups left 
and right. The complete lack 
of rim protection meant that 
the Carnegie Mellon offen-
sive, which had been clicking 
up to this point, was no lon-
ger afforded the easy transi-
tional baskets used to set their 
tempo, and they were forced 
to constantly set up out of the 
half-court offense.
Ultimately, the Maroons 
took the lead with just un-
der two minutes to go in the 
half. The Tartans attempted a 
comeback with Manoli regain-
ing the lead with 28 seconds 
left on a jump shot, but a Chi-
cago three-pointer with just 
under two seconds remain-
ing ended Carnegie Mellon’s 
dream of a clean sweep with 
the men falling 79–77.
For both teams, this week-
end was an example of the 
play they have been capable 
of, but for the men it was also 
an example of the inconsis-
tent and occasionally undisci-
plined play that has cost them 
several wins this season.

The Olympics weren’t sup-
posed to end this way. The 
United States was supposed 
to come home with gold, or 
at least a medal. But a day af-
ter losing to rival Canada, the 
United States men’s hockey 
team fell ?at against Finland, 
losing 5–0 in the bronze med-
al game. 
Now the team, composed 
of NHL players from across 
the league, is forced to pull 
it back together as they join 
their other teammates who 
competed for Russia, Canada 
and Finland, and who all had 
emotional games with the U.S. 
The Penguins will have a par-
ticularly interesting trip back 
as they try to continue their 
dominance through the Met-
ropolitan Division.
Head coach Dan Bylsma 
and assistant coach Tony 
Granato of the Penguins were 
both with the United States 
team in Sochi, with Bylsma 
serving as head coach of the 
U.S. national team. How he 
handles the disappointment of 
these Olympic Games and the 
massive media pressure that 
surrounds them will be key 
to the Penguins keeping level 
heads and making a strong 
push toward the playoffs.
Refocusing the team after 
this rough two-week stretch 
would be tough even for a 
coach that is not distracted, 
but balancing the tensions 
that arise from the rapid shift 
from teammates to competi-
tors and back will be an even 
tougher tight rope given Byls-
ma’s proximity to the national 
pride issues at hand.
Star center Evgeni Malkin 
may have the toughest time 
returning to form from the 
Olympics. Playing in his third 
Olympic games, Malkin was 
one of the many NHL stars try-
ing to bring gold back home to 
Russia at their home games. A 
common sentiment through-
out the games was that re-
gardless of medal totals, a 
gold medal for men’s hockey 
meant a successful Olympics 
for Russia.
Russia’s ?rst major chal-
lenge came against the United 
States in group play. Malkin 
was forced to go head-to-
head with his head coach and 
defensive teammates Paul 
Martin and Brooks Orpik in 
a game that, while meaning-
less for elimination purposes, 
felt and looked like the gold 
medal match. After the game 
controversially went into 
overtime due to an unallowed 
game-winning Russian goal, 
the resulting shootout was 
thought to go in Russia’s favor 
given the sharpshooters they 
had, such as Malkin. While St. 
Louis Blues winger T.J. Oshie 
became an overnight sensa-
tion in the U.S. for his winning 
4–6 shootout performance, 
Malkin missed the net with his 
?rst attempt and was not giv-
en another chance to redeem 
himself.
In part due to this loss, Rus-
sia was not afforded a bye and 
was forced to play Norway to 
win a spot in the quarter?nals. 
While this game was not much 
of a challenge, it clearly had 
an effect as Russia was wiped 
out by a rested Finland in the 
quarter?nals. Malkin man-
aged to get four shots on goal, 
but could not connect as the 
team fell 3–1. Malkin had the 
misfortune of going up against 
his line mate Jussi Jokinen in 
this game, as his bad luck 
streak against teammates 
continued.
While Malkin had tough 
individual games, the tough-
est rift to heal will likely be 
between the Canadian and 
U.S. contingents. With the 
neighbors facing off in the 
semi?nals, this was thought 
to be the default gold medal 
game with the winner cake-
walking to the ?nals victory. 
As such, tensions were riding 
high as the two NHL all-star 
squads faced off. With sev-
eral sets of teammates facing 
off against each other, likely 
none was more opposed than 
line mates Sidney Crosby and 
Chris Kunitz for team Canada 
against their Penguin team-
mates and blue line pairing, 
Orpik and Martin. The even-
tual 1–0 Canadian victory, 
while triumphant for Crosby 
and Kunitz was devastating 
to the U. S. contingent which, 
as stated earlier, ?ew home 
empty-handed after getting 
crushed by Finland.
With 24 games left for the 
Penguins when they restart 
play on Thursday, there is still 
plenty of time for the team to 
try and work past the national 
pride feelings that Sochi 
instilled. 
But these players are all 
very competitive and did not 
make it this far in their sport 
by not having a burning com-
petitive rage. How well Byls-
ma is able to rally himself and 
his team and get them to turn 
that emotion toward the com-
mon goal of bringing the Stan-
ley Cup back to Pittsburgh will 
determine the level of success 
the Penguins have come May. 
Some grudges are not so eas-
ily buried, but winning dulls 
all pain.

Men’s and women’s track teams sweep Ohio State Tune-Up
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
On Friday, the men’s and 
women’s track teams attended  
Ohio State Tune-Up in prepa-
ration for next week’s Uni-
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) Indoor Championships 
at Brandeis University. 
The men’s team had a good 
day, ?nishing second-place 
as a team, losing only to host 
Ohio State University. The 
women had several outstand-
ing individual performances 
as well.
For the men, ?rst-year An-
drew Chang set a school re-
cord in the 60-meter dash with 
a time of 7.11 seconds and 
grabbed a third place ?nish in 
the 200-meter dash.
First-year Kyle Weaver 
came close to breaking a 
school record, missing the 
pole vault record by a centi-
meter. He ultimately ?nished 
in sixth place with a jump of 
4.52 meters.
The Tartans’ long-distance 
running was their strength, 
with junior George Degen 
winning the 3,000-meter run 
and juniors Elliott Watson and 
Ben Walker placing ?rst and 
second in the 1,000-meter 
run.
Continuing Carnegie Mel-
lon’s junior dominance, Thom-
as Vandenberg took ?rst place 
in the 800-meter run with his 
time of 1:53.38, putting him 
third in the nation to go along 
with his top-ten national rank-
ing in the 400-meter dash.
For the women, it was all 
about their new ?rst-year tal-
ent. Sommer Farber set a ca-
reer best in the triple jump, 
?ying 9.76 meters and placing 
sixth. A pair of ?rst-year run-
ners, Rebecca Fortner and Ar-
iel Tian, performed well in the 
200- and 400-meter dashes, 
respectively.
The one upperclassman 
standout for the Tartans was 
junior Sasha Spalding, who 
had a season-best throw in the 
shot put of 10.44 meters.
It remains to be seen how 
the team and Vandenberg will 
continue into the UAAs and 
Vandenberg’s bid for NCAA 
Championships.Anne-Sophie Kim/Assistant Layout Manager

May 2013 was the lowest 
point  of Real Madrid’s re-
cent history. Having just lost 
the league by a whopping 15 
points and being humiliated 
by Borussia Dortmund in the 
Champions League, the Copa 
Del Rey ?nal presented an op-
portunity for redemption for 
the club, to salvage something 
from the season.
What followed was an 
embarrassing loss at the San-
tiago Bernabéu Stadium, their 
home ground, to ?erce city ri-
vals Atlético Madrid. Manager 
José Mourinho promptly left 
the club by mutual consent 
after three turbulent years of 
managing the club. 
The club was thrust into 
uncertainty. Superstar for-
ward Cristiano Ronaldo was 
being linked with a transfer 
back to his former club Man-
chester United.
To restore some decorum 
in the dressing room and 
to make a run at La Decima 
(Madrid’s tenth Champions 
League title), Madrid hired 
Carlo Ancelotti, a manager re-
nowned for his management 
skill and winning two Cham-
pions League titles with A.C. 
Milan. 
Even Ancelotti’s Madrid 
took a while to get going. 
Ronaldo’s extraordinary form 
in the latter months of 2013 
meant that Madrid were cruis-
ing in the Champions League 
group stage, but struggling in 
the league and six points off 
the top of the league. 
World record-signing wing-
er Gareth Bale injured himself 
just after reaching top form. 
Madrid were shipping goals 
at an alarming rate. Defensive 
mid?elder Sami Khedira was 
ruled out for the rest of the 
season with a torn ACL and 
MCL. 
Things were looking bleak 
for Los Blancos and the pos-
sibility of trophies this season 
was turning into a pipe dream. 
At the turn of the year, how-
ever, a new Madrid was born. 
They have probably been 
the best team besides Bayern 
Munich since, and Ancelotti 
can take a lot of credit for that. 
What exactly has changed?
One of the biggest changes 
from the Mourinho era was 
the sale of mid?elder Mesut 
Özil and the subsequent sign-
ing of Bale. 
Özil was Madrid’s chief 
playmaker and was consid-
ered by many to be as impor-
tant to Madrid as the likes of 
strikers Ronaldo and Karim 
Benzema.
However, Ancelotti con-
sidered his lack of effort on 
defense to be detrimental to 
the team, and with a switch 
in formation to 4-3-3 from 
4-2-3-1, there was no place to 
utilize Özil’s talents. Madrid 
struggled without the in?u-
ence of Özil and the spark he 
so often provided to create 
several goals.

Alonso out through injury,

What if robots lived like we did?
Secret Life of Robots depicts robots in everyday situations
We know that robots can do all kinds of amazing 
things for us, but what do they do when we’re not 
looking? An exhibition titled The Secret Life of 
Robots offers “an unpolished look into the unseen, 
and often mundane, lives of robots,” according to 
the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The display opened at 
the SPACE Gallery in Downtown on Friday evening.
Local artist Toby Atticus Fraley drew inspiration 
from his sketchbook in the creation of the display. 
“Robots assembled from pieces of Americana 
illustrate mundane everyday rituals, acts of daring, 
and precious milestones,” Fraley said in a press 
release. “These scenes of great joy and crushing 
sadness cover the beginning to the end of a typical 
robot’s life span, celebrating and revering the beauty 
in the everyday.”
This whimsical collection of expressive robots 
was a pleasant reprieve from the more somber 
subjects of other galleries. Fraley combated the 
cold, mechanical monotony typically associated 
with robots — using the down-home comfort of 
their settings. The quirky robots made the relatable, 
humdrum scenes intriguing and delightful. The 
knickknacks and décor of the robots’ homes 
transported viewers to the more wholesome era of 
the ‘50s. For the opening of the gallery, DJ Gordy 
Greenawalt amplified the experience with sounds of 
doo-wop and swing.
Fraley makes mixed media sculptures and clockwork 
pieces on a day-to-day basis for his clients, but 
chose to represent his own ideas in this recent 
gallery. Most of the robots grew unique personalities 
as he built them, a modern twist on finding the 
figure in the clay, Fraley said in an interview. “The 
eyebrows — that’s where they really start getting 
their personalities.” Using materials that he finds 
in flea markets in the summer and on eBay in the 
winter, Fraley’s robots revitalize worn-down baubles 
with true American resilience.
While some of the scenes are static, others have 
moving parts that enhance the lifelike aspects. 
Among other moving scenes, an elderly robot 
welcomes viewers as he wavers back and forth 
while reaching for his glasses, and a father robot 
puts on a puppet show for his child. Fraley admits 
that there was no real formula as to which scenes 
had motion and which scenes had none; he simply 
chose to animate whatever scenes spoke to him. 
“There were some that I wanted to have move, like 
the lady reaching for the cat food, but I just didn’t 
have time,” Fraley said.
The Secret Life of Robots is an engaging display 
for viewers of all artistic tastes and backgrounds. 
Viewers can enjoy this free exhibition through April 
27.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Matt and Ryan,
Did you know it’s no 
longer last Friday? I had 
no idea. I’ve been binge-
watching the new season 
of House of Cards since 
the moment it came out. 
HAVE YOU SEEN IT? 
HOW CAN YOU WATCH 
THAT JUST ONCE. THE 
FIRST EPISODE JUST 
STARTS AND THEN 
[redacted for spoilers].
Sincerely,
[also redacted for 
spoilers]
Dear REDACTED,
So, we kind of lost you there 
and you didn’t really ask a 
question for us to answer. 
But you did mention how 
you “lost track of” this week. 
First order of business, 
email everyone. All of your 
professors, maybe your 
advisor too. Let them know 
what happened and hope 
they understand. Make up 
any of the work you missed. 
Get notes from your friends. 
No friends? Make some. 
Hopefully you didn’t miss 
anything terribly important, 
and you seem lucid now, 
so hopefully you’ve already 
started catching up.
The other problem that could 
arise is a fear that everyone 
you meet will eventually use 
and backstab you. And we 
can’t really help with that. If 
you start looking in shadows 
and staying indoors, you 
might want to seek help.
I mean, really, we 
probably aren’t out to get 
you. Probably.
Matt & Ryan
Dear Ryan and Matt,
YOU GUYS.
SUNLIGHT.
WARMTH.
IT’S HAPPENING. SPRING 
IS FINALLY HERE.
TIME TO PUT ON MAH 
BOOTY SHORTS AND 
PICK UP THE LADIES.
YEAH WARMTH,
Happy Emotions Readily 
Energize, Clear & Open 
Mind Especially Since The 
Heat Eradicated Snow, 
Umbrellas Nonessential
Dear 
HERECOMESTHESUN,
Slow down there, cowboy 
(or girl). You’re gonna scare 
this weather off! Finally, for 
the first time in far too long 
we have a couple of half-
decent days and you have 
to go and get up in arms 
about it. We’re not out of the 
woods yet — spring doesn’t 
start until late March (after 
our spring break, ironically), 
so we’ve got a while until 
we can start expecting days 
like this all the time (or, at the 
very least, not entirely out of 
the realm of possibility). But 
that does mean we still have 
time to work on our spring 
booties and we can all pick 
up dem ladies. So get out 
there! Hit the gym! Do some 
yoga, some crunches and 
maybe go for a run while we 
can see pavement! Get off 
that couch now that you’re 
done watching the new 
season of House of Cards, 
and sculpt that bootay!
This message totally not 
brought to you by that 
Healthy Campus initiative,

The cultural phenomenon that is Twitch Plays Pokémon 
(TPP) began unassumingly last Wednesday when an 
anonymous Australian opened a new stream on the 
game streaming service Twitch. The idea was simple: 
using the chat window, users could type in basic Game 
Boy commands — “left”, “right”, “up”, “down”, “a”, “b” 
and “start” — and a bot would input them into the game. 
There was a simple timer above the command scroll, and 
the fundamental idea was to see how long it would take 
to crowd source through one of the original Pokémon 
games, Red Version.
Things started simply enough when a group of around 
3,000 users beat the ?rst gym before the ?rst day mark. 
There were initial hiccups that were to be expected with 
any Internet-based crowd sourcing. Trolls spammed 
the “start” command, which completely bogged down 
progress. In response, the creator throttled “start” usage 
stating that he wanted to interfere as little as possible 
but would step in if necessary.
Things were moving well, with a small community 
popping up, until TPP players hit their ?rst big obstacle, 
HM01 Cut. This move is required to go through the 
game, but must be taught to a Pokémon after being 
acquired. This process is relatively simple for a six-
year-old child playing the game, but the seven-button 
sequence was the ?rst real obstacle faced by TPP.
From that point on, TPP has just been a series of 
challenges such as using Cut, navigating a tricky ledge 
path, and getting through the Team Rocket Hideout. 
Up until this point, everything had been accomplished 
through controlled chaos with several strategies being 
determined to help navigate the swelling masses 
through dif?cult tasks all while combatting the ever-
growing lag.
But unlike these previous challenges where maybe 
everything could be accomplished with a little bit of 
“hive-mind” strategy and patience, the Rocket Hideout 
was different. To navigate to the Lift Key necessary to 
operate the elevator, players must navigate through 
a complex arrow puzzle. One false move out of 30 or 
so restarts the puzzle. After the better part of the day 
of struggle and frustration, the creator stepped in. A 
new form of control was implemented: democracy. In 
this method, all of the commands were tallied over a 
10-second period and then acted out over the next 
10-second voting period. Users could string together 
commands such as “left2up3” which would have the 
player move left twice and up three times during the 
10-second period. This change infuriated much of the 
following because of the dullness. 
People were watching and playing not to see ef?ciency, 
but to see the story that this randomness had created. 
By this point, there was an entire canon surrounding 
the game. The random nicknames created by random, 
or anarchy, control had led a personi?cation to the 
Pokémon, such as the Rattata nicknamed JLVWNNOOO, 
or Jay Leno, and a Charmander nicknamed ABBBBBBK, 
or Abby. There was also a religion spawned by the 
frequent attempted use of the Helix Fossil in battle or 
while walking around, which led to religious overtones 
being pushed through the metagame, such as the over-
leveled Pidgeot being dubbed Bird Jesus.
One of the most controversial moments had come just 
before entering the Rocket Hideout when a group of 
players decided to get a free Eevee. At this point, there 
was an open spot in the Pokémon team being saved for 
Lapras because of the need of a Pokémon who could 
learn HM02 Surf to progress in the game and the fear 
that accessing the PC to exchange Pokémon would end 
in heartbreak, as the risk of releasing Pokémon was very 
high given the random actions of the group.
Eevee was not hopeless, however, as it could be evolved 
into the Surf-learning Vaporeon with a purchased 
Water Stone. But the stream was not nearly this precise 
and instead bought a Fire Stone, creating the rather 
worthless Flareon, who was quickly deemed the False 
Prophet. A civil war erupted on the stream and led to 
Abby and Jay Leno both being released in an attempt to 
deposit the False Prophet, who was also released.
Because of this growing narrative, which wouldn’t 
have happened under democracy control, the creator 
made a concession. Players could now vote for the 
control scheme — anarchy or democracy — with a 75 
percent majority needed to swap from one to the other. 
Many recent players like the ease of democracy, but the 
anarchists staged a passive protest by spamming the 
command “start9”, which caused the character to enter 
the menu nine consecutive times. After about a day of 
struggle, democracy became a last-hope. Players utilized 
democracy only to navigate the most complicated 
puzzles such as the step-limited Safari Zone.
TPP has become an Internet phenomenon. At its peak, 
there have been over 120,000 logged-in active users 
capable of inputting commands and, as of Sunday night, 
nearly 26 million unique visitors to the stream. As with 
all Internet things, it spawned its own subreddit, which 
has further intensi?ed the culture and was ranked the 
36th most active subreddit. The subreddit drew in over 
66,000 users in under a week. It came with its own live 
update stream that reached over 20,000 viewers.
Pokémon is still a popular game — the new X and Y 
versions came out last year — but it has become a 
purely strategy game for most people. But TPP isn’t 
about Pokémon. As the creator put in the ?rst line of the 
description, TPP is a social experiment. We have seen an 
entire subculture, complete with religion, politics, and 
mythos arise in under a week.
4chan summed it up best: “[over 45,000] people just 
staged a micro-protest by repeatedly voting for a passive 
action on a[n] online cooperatively controlled Japanese 
RPG from [1996] in order to change the method of 
control. Living in the future is weird.”

How to ?nd retail therapy on the Internet
Online shopping provides many outlets and opportunities to spice up your wardrobe
Are there times when you feel the need to go shopping, 
but are discouraged by the terrifying idea of relying on 
the Port Authority to get there? The endless wait for the 
bus and the ensuing hour-long ride makes the process 
of physically going shopping extremely dif?cult for most 
students. They often wait until breaks or visits from 
parents to ful?ll their shopping needs. While most people 
will ?nd this waiting perfectly ?ne, shopping addicts, 
such as myself, would wholeheartedly disagree.
What if you need something on short notice? Online 
shopping is a common practice used to assuage this 
issue. While online shopping is a widely-used solution, 
it  requires background knowledge in order to be done 
smartly and ef?ciently.
There is the option of ordering clothing items from the 
websites of physically existing stores, but there are 
some problems associated with this choice. Stores that 
solely function as websites generally offer free returns 
on purchased items and do not have a minimum price 
necessary to attain free shipping. In contrast, those that 
operate as brick-and-mortar stores have a minimum 
amount for free shipping. An added bene?t of shopping 
online is the opportunity to ?nd clothing that is unique. 
After all, you don’t want to wear the same Urban 
Out?tters sweater that you’ve already seen 10 other 
people wearing on campus. Fortunately, outlined below 
is a guide to shopping online that covers a range of 
stores to suit any style.
Let’s say you’re a fan of the beachy, bohemian style of 
clothing found at stores, such as Free People and Brandy 
Melville. Long, ?owing maxi skirts, billowy blouses, and 
?oral kimonos are the way to go. In that case, check out 
www.threadsence.com, www.shopplanetblue.com, and 
www.saboskirt.com.
Out of the three websites listed, the one that comes 
closest to Free People is ThreadSence. While the 
concepts behind the designs found on ThreadSence 
are similar to Free People, the clothes are not the 
cheap replicas that other stores offer. The clothes on 
the ThreadSence website are not as overpriced as Free 
People, and are of decent quality. There is also a wide 
variety of clothing, as opposed to a few sweaters or 
skirts.
Planet Blue shares this characteristic, as well as the 
bohemian vibe, with ThreadSence. However, the style 
portrayed on the website is more reminiscent of the 
beach, with comfortable wide-legged pants and slouchy 
sweaters. Blouses with intricate cutouts and designs 
make it possible to also ?nd fancier items at Planet Blue. 
This website is known as a favorite among celebrities, 
including the actress and boho-trendsetter Vanessa 
Hudgens, as well as her High School Musical co-star 
Ashley Tisdale. A physical store for Planet Blue exists, 
but only in Southern California, which is a little far from 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus. The store’s popularity among 
celebrities also means that it’s quite pricey. One shirt 
generally costs over $100, but their sale section is nice to 
go through occasionally.
Sabo Skirt is another worthwhile bohemian store. 
Based out of Australia, Sabo Skirt offers clothing that is 
beach-inspired, featuring bralettes, crop tops, and thin 
sweaters and knits. There’s less variety in the style of the 
clothing, but the website is reputable. Keep this store in 
mind, but wait for warmer weather before you place an 
order.
Though it has gained signi?cant popularity, the 
bohemian style is still — as one might expect — not 
everyone’s favorite. Maybe you prefer your clothing 
items to possess a quirky or vintage feel, like those found 
at Anthropologie. In that case, the online shopping sites 
www.shopruche.com and www.modcloth.com are for 
you. Founded right here in Pittsburgh, ModCloth is the 
more well-known of the two. While the headquarters 
for ModCloth are located in this city, it is still an online-
only. Polka-dot dresses, blouses with cute Peter Pan 
collars, and leggings with quirky patterns are among the 
clothing available at ModCloth. Another bene?t of the 
website is its overwhelming variety.
Ruche is a smaller, and more elegant version of 
ModCloth. Many of the clothing items on both websites 
are the same, and there is a heavy amount of overlap 
between the two, but the clothing on ModCloth seems 
more childish. The same company that owns Ruche also 
owns ThreadSence, but the clothing is quite different. 
Ruche’s winning quality is de?nitely its array of printed 
shirts and blouses found on the website, which are 
similar to those found at Anthropologie without being 
blatant copies, but are much cheaper.
Making the transition from vintage to preppy comes 
with stores such as J. Crew and Francesca’s Collections. 
While you could make the trip to Walnut Street and 
deal with the possibility of returning empty-handed, 
you could also avoid moving at all and do the same 
thing from your laptop. Websites to check out for 
something different include www.jackwills.com, www.
reddressboutique.com, and www.shophopes.com. 
Most similar to J. Crew is British-based clothing store 
Jack Wills, with puffy vests, shirts, and ?tted cable-knit 
sweaters. It can be quite expensive, with the cheapest 
sweater at $90, but the clothing is also very good quality. 
Red Dress Boutique and Hope’s are both very similar, 
and together bear a strong resemblance to Francesca’s 
Collections. They stray from the elegance of J. Crew, but 
remain bright and preppy.
If some of these stores sound appealing to you, check 
them out. You can get your shopping done without even 
leaving the couch.

This week, go to a party with no limits, no boundaries, 
and no compromises — speci?cally, composer and 
producer Andrew Lippa’s stage musical The Wild Party, 
performed by the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama. 
Filled with nonstop action and song, The Wild Party 
lives up to its name as it tells the story of a tumultuous 
relationship between two 1920s vaudeville performers 
over the course of one crazy night.
The Wild Party stars senior musical theatre major Claire 
Saunders as Queenie, the irrepressible vaudevillian 
beauty. Wrapped in a scintillating silver dress, Saunders 
absolutely dominates her place in the spotlight, 
bringing out Queenie’s strong personality as well as the 
character’s more vulnerable side. Starring opposite her 
is senior acting major Brian Muller as Burrs, Queenie’s 
darkly passionate but abusive lover who becomes 
increasingly desperate as he fears that Queenie will 
leave him. Muller’s performance is a dif?cult balancing 
act that evokes both sympathy and revulsion for the 
character.
Senior musical theatre major Zanny Laird portrays 
Kate, a prostitute and professional party girl who tries 
to seduce Burrs. Laird, who goes above and beyond in 
providing the energy needed for the role, is always fun 
to watch whenever she appears on stage. Finally, senior 
acting and musical theatre double major Daniel Bellomy 
is Black, a mysterious gentleman stranger who, despite 
being the opposite of the explosive Burrs, catches 
Queenie’s eye. Bellomy is smooth, dapper, and emanates 
an air of enigma as he seduces Queenie during the 
course of the play.
While the performances are top notch, the best part 
of the production is assistant professor of dance Tomé 
Cousin’s mesmerizing choreography. It is a perfect 
mix of anarchy, sexuality, and elegance — the very 
embodiment of a party in the Roaring Twenties. Like 
Jackson Pollock’s drips of paint, dancers ?ip and turn, 
tumble and twist, frisk and rumble as they weave among 
each other. There is always something to look at; at 
times it becomes almost overwhelming.
The choreography is at its best at its most ferocious. For 
instance, in the sequence “The Apartment,” when Burrs 
assaults Queenie, Saunders is roughly and continually 
thrown onto a bed like a doll. While it is clear that this is 
only stage action, it nonetheless brings about a sense of 
danger and apprehension. The lively party sequences are 
just as well executed; the amount of activity and motion 
make it feel like a party thrown by Jay Gatsby although 
there are only a dozen actors on stage. Acts like “The 
Juggernaut” and “A Wild, Wild Party” feature exuberant, 
?awless dancing in which the partygoers move as one 
cohesive whole.
Further accentuating the choreography is the dusky, 
sensual lighting. Deep, saturated hues and shades create 
intense moods — from a sweltering New York City 
apartment in the summer to a hazy daze of drunken blue. 
Furthermore, a rotating stage is used in certain acts, 
such as “Queenie Was a Blonde,” “A Wild, Wild Party,” 
and “Come with Me,” to show off more of the amazing 
choreography and focus the audience’s attention on the 
central action.
Of course, a party is nothing without music, and The 
Wild Party brings a mixture of hot jazz, high swing, 
blues, and gospel, although it veers from actual 1920s 
music toward more like something you would hear in 
West Side Story. Nonetheless, it still has the brassy 
?avor and bravado necessary to complement the action 
on stage. The music never stops; each song blends 
seamlessly into the next, as if the whole show is simply 
one extended piece of music.
The songs themselves span across a range of moods. 
“Out of the Blue” expresses Queenie’s desire to renew 
passion into her love life. “An Old-Fashioned Love Story” 
is a hilarious piece sung by a desperate lesbian looking 
for love. “Look at Me Now” and “Life of the Party” display 
both the light, fun-loving and darker, attention-seeking 
sides of Kate’s character. “Two of a Kind” is an adorable 
love song between a boxer and his girlfriend. “What Is It 
About Her?” is Burrs’ song of his deep, dark obsession 
with Queenie. “Let Me Drown” is about forgetting your 
worries in a bathtub of gin.
The Wild Party also features beautiful vintage-inspired 
costumes. Although many costumes bear the trademark 
feathers and sequins of the ‘20s, the crisp, dark colors of 
the costumes have almost a Gothic feel to them, which 
tonally re?ects the appending danger and dark end to 
the story.
The Wild Party is essentially a modern take on the 
1920s, but it remains true to the spirit of the era. It is 
raunchy and relentless, and rides on a wave of chaotic 
energy toward its dark, accusatory ending. The School of 
Drama’s production is truly a feast for the eyes and ears, 
and kicks off its centennial year with a bang. The Wild 
Party will be playing in the Phillip Chosky Theater at the 
Purnell Center for the Arts through March 1.

music
pillbox 02.24.147
Turning a passion for something like computer science 
into a viable career is not dif?cult. Turning something 
like music into a viable career, especially in such an 
uncommon form as the brass quintet, is much harder. 
But that’s what the members of Carnegie Mellon’s 
ensemble-in-residence C Street Brass are doing.
“What you see on stage is such a small part of what goes 
into it all,” trumpet player and advanced performance 
certi?cate in trumpet student Kyle Anderson said 
during an interview following the release of Wop De 
Wop. Trombone player and second-year trombone 
performance graduate student Gabriel Colby was also 
present. Wop de Wop is a collaborative EP between brass 
quintet C Street Brass and electronic artist Jakeisrain, 
a sophomore music technology and philosophy double 
major at Carnegie Mellon named Jake Bernsten.               
C Street Brass also includes trumpet player and second-
year trumpet performance master’s student Scott 
Nadelson, French horn player and advanced performance 
certi?cate in French horn student Eric Damashek, and 
bass trombone player and second year-bass trombone 
performance master’s student Hakeem Bilal.
While at the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore, where the ?ve band members 
originally met, the musicians were aware that their 
art form held a limited number of opportunities. “The 
brass quintet as an art form … it’s relatively young, but 
it’s almost been played out already,” Anderson said. 
“And so the encouragement to ?nd a niche, something 
a little more different, was always encouraged by our 
earlier teachers, but then when we got here, it’s like, 
you actually need to do it.... It hit us pretty hard, that we 
needed to start branching out a little more if we wanted 
to do this.”
Colby added, “It’s not that we don’t believe in the art 
form — because we do — it’s knowing that, and doing 
something with the knowledge. There’s so much new 
technology. There’s more possible.”
The band members wanted to leave Baltimore after 
graduation but also keep playing together. “We knew 
a kind of standard path that groups kind of similar to 
ours go through — or professional groups — is that they 
align themselves with a university,” Colby said. “So 
there are all kinds of residencies, all different kinds, that 
mean different things ... we were like, well, why don’t 
we just propose that we could be resident ensemble 
somewhere?” They applied to three different programs 
and got into all of them, but Carnegie Mellon was their 
?rst choice.
“Everyone has other things that they do, but we’re 
all passionate about making this work,” Colby said. 
“We’re trying to do everything,” Anderson added. He 
explained that C Street Brass puts a lot of effort into 
maintaining their classical presence in Pittsburgh, while 
trying to build up a repertoire of electronic brass music 
with Jakeisrain. On top of that, he said that the band 
members are “learning these insanely dif?cult, modern 
compositions that don’t have a place in the rock hall 
or the concert hall, but we’re learning them anyways 
because we need to know them if we’re ever going to 
pass that information along to our future students.” All 
of the practicing ends up taking at least ?ve hours a day, 
every day, and both Colby and Anderson pointed out 
that sometimes it’s much more than that.
Both Anderson and Colby cite the closeness of the 
band as part of the reason this project works at all. “It’s 
also kind of two-sided, because we’re really together 
musically, like playing-wise and sound-wise. Gabe will 
schedule gigs, Eric and I will write arrangements … 
Hakeem will look pretty,” Anderson said with a grin. 
“But no, he does the Facebook page, and Scott does 
the website.… We’re all actively participating, which is 
something that keeps the motor running.”
Colby said: “We’re also just trying to become better 
musicians, and it’s like, these shows are so much fun; 
our goal is to make the audience have a good time, but 
at the same time, you need to grow as a musician, and 
so we work on these insane pieces, that it’s sort of like a 
rite of passage to become a virtuoso on your 
instrument.”
Carnegie Mellon is a place that prides itself on its 
ruthless enthusiasm, and its commitment to its various 
disciplines. As a university with a heavy technical focus, 
many of those disciplines translate easily into traditional 
job opportunities. C Street Brass is an example of a group 
of young, talented musicians who are making a less 
traditional passion a viable possibility for themselves.

There’s no business like show business, and nobody knows 
that better than the School of Drama. In celebration of its 
100th birthday, the School of Drama threw a party for its 
students, alumni, and faculty to reconnect over dancing, 
desserts, and drinks at the Purnell Center for the Arts this 
Saturday following the evening showing of The Wild Party.
The party was a production; the lobby was transformed into 
a spectacle of bright neon lights and loud music to set the 
mood for festive networking and reconnecting. It was the ?rst 
in a series of anniversary parties, with celebrations in New 
York City and Los Angeles later this year.
The School of Drama has plenty to be excited about. Founded 
in 1914 as the ?rst degree-granting theatrical program in 
the United States, the school was part of an effort to develop 
a higher level of serious, professional theater by producing 
classically trained actors, stage technicians, and directors 
that could take the art to new heights.
Since its founding, the School of Drama has changed as the 
theater and entertainment sector has grown dramatically and 
come to take a different place in society. After all, 100 years 
ago, moving pictures were new, electronic lights in theaters 
were exciting, and the forerunner of absurdist theatre, 
playwright George Feydeau, was in his prime. As the turn 
of the century allowed more time and money to be spent on 
entertainment, theaters on Broadway were just beginning 
to gain momentum, and the ?rst ?lms were being produced 
in Hollywood. American theatre was taking off. Theatre of 
the past — low-level community entertainment in churches, 
nightclubs, and small stages — was being transformed into 
high-class productions to entertain a new class of people.
The School of Drama has played an integral role within this 
evolution of theatre, and continues to be a powerhouse 
within the entertainment world. In an age of entertainment, 
we are surrounded by movies, performances, and TV 
shows. The School of Drama works to allow its students to 
understand the changing role of entertainment in society, and 
to be a part of it.
Equally important as developing their excellence, designers 
and directors are helping young actors make a break in a 
notoriously cut-throat job market. With events such as the 
Centennial, the School of Drama builds connections in show 
business. It helps that ?nding famous School of Drama alumni 
is really no more dif?cult than watching an awards show. This 
past year alone, no less than eight Carnegie Mellon alumni 
brought home Tony Awards, and two more won Emmys. 
While more people have heard of the famous actors that are 
alumni, such as Matt Bomer (BFA, ‘00) of White Collar and 
Zachary Quinto (BFA,’99), designers and directors have had 
at least equal achievements in pushing productions to new 
levels.
For a program with such deep legacy and such a strong 
network of alumni, the focus now is on what the future holds. 
Peter Cooke, the head of the School of Drama since 2009, has 
talked about pushing the capacity of the School of Drama by 
embracing Carnegie Mellon’s interdisciplinary approach to 
work with the more technical side of the university.
The Centennial celebrations speak to the School of Drama’s 
focus on fostering a close community of students, alumni, 
and faculty raising the next generation of performance.
The School of Drama celebrates 100 years of stage and screen magic
Over the past century, the School of Drama has been at the forefront of changes in entertainment and society’s relationship to the craft of theatre
Top: The School of Drama’s first-ever production was the William Shakespeare comedy The Two Gentlemen of 
Verona, directed by Thomas Wood Stevens. In the hundred years since its founding, the School of Drama has 
added the distinction of being the oldest degree-granting drama program in the United States to its long list of 
accolades.
Bottom: In 1927, amidst the hubbub of the roaring ‘20s, the School of Drama staged a production of what 
is arguably William Shakespeare’s most somber play, King Lear, directed by E. Martin Browne. At the time, 
Browne also worked with poet T.S. Eliot to produce some of the author’s plays. Performing the titular Lear, who 
descends into madness after dismissing the only daughter out of his three who loved him too much to flatter 
his ego, is considered one of the greatest accomplishments an actor can achieve.

Top: The School of Drama’s 2010-11season included a dreamy production of the William Shakespeare comedy 
favorite, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, directed by Don Wadsworth. The magical world of the play, complete with 
fairy kings and queens, was well-evoked in the set’s design.
Bottom: The School of Drama’s 2011-12 season featured a production of the pioneering dramatist Bertolt 
Brecht’s musical The Good Person of Setzuan, directed by visiting German director Peter Kleinert with music 
directed by Jurgen Beyer. 
Left: The School of Drama kicked off their 2012-13 season with Richard Brinsley’s classic comedy of manners, 
The Rivals, directed by visting British director Annie Tyson. The play’s most popular character Mrs. Malaprop, who 
often comedically misuses words, is the source of the English word “malapropism.”

“I’m Andrew Jackson. I’m your President. Let’s blow the 
roof off!” (Cue intense rock music.)
Take one glance at a musical’s poster promising “sex, 
democracy amd rock and roll,” and you instantly know 
this play doesn’t take itself too seriously. The Pittsburgh 
Playhouse production of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, 
an unorthodox play that brie?y ran on Broadway, 
premiered at the Point Park University’s Rockwell 
Theatre on Friday.
The idea behind the musical is as far-fetched as it gets. 
The musical re-imagines seventh president Andrew 
Jackson as an emo rock star. The plot loosely follows 
Jackson’s rise to the presidency, with plenty of live rock 
solos and over-the-top dance acts in between. However, 
the musical is not for the faint of heart or for younger 
audiences. Every scene is chock full of swearing, sexual 
innuendos, and concert-level lighting. Some jokes rely 
heavily on racial stereotype as well. For those who aren’t 
overly sensitive to such elements, Bloody Bloody Andrew 
Jackson is a roller coaster of a musical full of energy.
The play features a huge cast of characters. It’s easy to 
forget who’s who, especially if you lack a basic historical 
understanding of Andrew Jackson’s life. There are 
two prominent characters that stand out the most — 
Andrew Jackson himself (Reed Worth) and his wife 
Rachel Donelson (Brittany Dorazio). Both have strong 
singing voices that suit hard rock and emotion-laden 
moments. Most of the actors are local theatre students 
from Point Park University with the exception of seventh 
grader Dom Masciola, who plays Jackson’s adopted son 
Lyncoya.
A historically accurate timeline of Jackson’s life is 
included in each playbook, which lets the audience 
compare what they see on stage against the actual 
events. Jokes are taken to the extreme, with varying 
results. For instance, when Jackson swears vengeance 
on the Native Americans for killing his family, a crew of 
scantily clad men dressed in stereotypical garb dance to 
the “Sugar Plum Fairy” song. In another case, Jackson 
and Rachel cover each other with blood in some strange 
ritual of professing their love for each other.
Although it is obvious that the play takes itself very 
lightly and that these moments are for quick laughs, 
such moments could be unpopular with the wrong 
crowd. But here and there, tasteful history jokes are 
mixed in with pop culture references. Jackson uses an 
iPad for Indian treaties, complete with Siri. Jackson’s 
political campaign is turned into a rock tour, featuring 
the band “Andrew Jackson and the Populists.” At one 
point, Jackson unforgettably says to Rachel, “Sometimes 
when I’m on the battle?eld suffering from dysentery and 
diarrhea, I think of you” in order to prove his love to her. 
There are ample jokes poking fun at slavery, diseases, 
and the practice of bleeding out. The play could 
bene?t from having more of these moments, as they 
are entertaining for both history fans and the general 
audience.
The second half of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson — 
which focuses on Jackson’s struggles as the President — 
is considerably less crazy than the ?rst. The jokes aren’t 
as offensive, and character struggles and moral issues 
become the focus, leading to a surprisingly somber 
ending to the play.
The set itself is impressive, accurately resembling a 
concert bar. But the set can sometimes distract from 
moments of the play that are supposed to occur at 
a battle?eld since the set is never changed until the 
second half of the play. Lighting is also notably well done 
for the small production. At exciting moments, colored 
lights ?ash as a fog machine churns along. However, 
minor microphone issues did interfere with the overall 
?ow of songs and dramatic plot points.
For the right crowd, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson is 
an exciting musical sensation that’s rough around the 
edges. But it could easily offend, so those with strong 
opinions about the subject matter should steer clear. 
The play will be showing until March 2. Tickets start at 
$18 or $20, depending on the day of the performance.

Former President Jackson goes bloody crazy
Unorthodox, imaginative Broadway musical is an irreverent tribute to the seventh president
The energetic and raunchy Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, the Pittsburgh Playhouse’s latest production, reimag-
ines the seventh president of the United States as a modern-era emo rock star, complete with Indian treaties 
written on iPads and a presidential campaign that acts more like a concert tour.
