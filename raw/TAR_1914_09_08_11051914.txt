Mass meetings come and mass meet­
ings go but there is one that we are 
going to remember forever, the one 
held last Thursday afternon at the 
Music Hall in honor of Mr. and Mrs. 
Andrew Carnegie. There are many 
reasons why we will never forget this 
meeting, among which we might men­
tion speeches by shining lights among 
the student body, the enthusiasm of 
the students, the cheering, and pos­
sibly the rain which seemingly pos­
sessed with the spirit of the occasion, 
came out in full force, or as might be 
said more properly, came down in 
great torrents.
On commencement the student bod­
ies assembled in front of their re­
spective schools, and headed by the 
band marched through the park to 
the Music Hall. Here they assembled 
in front of the building to welcome 
Mr. Carnegie. Upon his arrival Mr. 
Carnegie, together with Mrs. Car­
negie, Mr. Church, the president of 
the Board of Trustees, and several of 
the Board of Trustees, were ushered 
to the stage. Mr. Church then opened 
the meeting by making a short speech 
in which he said that the mass meet­
ing had been called in honor of Mr. 
and Mrs. Carnegie. He went on to 
say that it was the first time in the 
history of the institution that such an 
affair had been held, at which were 
gathered all the day school students, 
faculty, and employees of the school, 
and library. Mr. Church then said 
that he was going to turn the meeting 
over to the students, and suggested 
that the students call upon any one 
whom they desired for a short speech. 
Balsinger was the first victim and 
made a short and yet appropriate 
specch of gratitude to Mr. and Mrs. 
Carnegie. “Bally” then followed b'y 
Miss Dickey, who is boss of the M. M.
C. S. political machine, or at least 
we suppose she is, as are senior class 
presidents. After hearing her speech 
everyone decided that possibly there 
are others than men who are good 
orators. In turn all the senior presi­
dents, members of the faculty, and 
department heads of the institute 
were called upon for short messages 
to which they all hestitatingly re­
sponded, thanking their lucky stars 
that Mr. Church had specified that 
they were to be “short messages.” 
Mr. Carnegie then followed, and 
anyone who has ever heard him speak

The Varsity won the fourth victory 
of the season last Saturday when the 
Plaid eleven defeated Bethany by the 
score of 32 to 19. The Green team 
proved itself to be one of the most 
formidable of those which has op­
posed Tech so far this season. The 
West Virginians’ three touchdowns 
were the first scored this season 
against Carnegie on the home field. 
Tech took the lead at the beginning 
of the game and succeeded in holding 
it until the finish. During the first 
quarter Bethany seemed unable to 
cope with their opponents’ strong of­
fensive playing and during this time 
Tech piled up the greater part of her 
score. In the second quarter the vis­
itors took a quite apparent brace and 
Carnegie was forced to her utmost to 
win. The speed of the home team’s 
backfield was of great advantage and 
time after time the backs out-distanced 
their opponents for long end runs.
Tech’s interference was especially 
good and two or three men almost 
always protected the runner from the 
opposing tacklers. Bethany’s line was 
somewhat weak and the Tech backs 
tore through frequently for large
gjains. Many forward passes were
tried by both teams, but very little
ground was gained by this means. Out 
of eighteen attempts by the visitors, 
only three were successful, five were 
gathered in by the Plaid and the rest 
were incomplete. Of five attempts by 
Carnegie, one was intercepted by 
Bethany and two proved successful.
A feature of the game was the play­
ing of Marshall, Carnegie’s speedy 
left half, who made many long end 
runs as well as intercepting a forward 
pass by Rogers and running forty-five 
yards for a touchdown. Balsinger, 
likewise, played an excellent game, 
making large gains through Bethany’s 
line. At quarterback, Kesner, as 
usual, starred, running the team in al­
most perfect manner. Tech’s line, on 
the offense, succedded in opening 
many holes for their backs to gain 
through. Captain Rogers, of Bethany, 
deserves special credit for the game 
he put up at half back. Not only 
was he the most consistent ground 
gainer for his team, but also a kicker 
of considerable ability and excellent 
at handling forward passes.
Tech’s squad was considerably dis­
abled by pervious injuries and as a 
result neither Crawford, Oeffinger, 
nor Kreider were able to play.
The weather was fair and all that 
could be desired for a football game.
As a result, a large crowd turned out 
to witness the contest. The detailed 
account:
First Quarter.
Bethany won the toss and chose to 
defend the west goal. Balsinger 
kicked off to Bethany’s 6-yard line and 
Elder returned the ball 25 yards. Tech 
then held the visitors for downs and 
Rogers kicked the ball to Tech’s 25 
yard line. Marshall received the kick 
and ran it back to Carnegie’s 42-yard 
line. A 36-yard run by Kesner and 
several line plunges by Balsinger re­
sulted in Carnegie’s first touchdown. 
Kesner kicked the goal, but, as the 
holder did not allow the ball to touch 
the ground before it was kicked, the 
point did not count. Balsinger kicked 
off to Bethany’s 15-yard line and 
Moore ran the ball back 18-yards. Tech 
gained the ball on a fumble and car­
ried it down the field a short distance. 
Bethany received the ball on dowps 
and Rogers kicked to Kesner on Beth­
any’s 40-yard line. Kesner returned 
the ball by a 25-yard run. Tech’s quar­
ter then fumbled and D. Hughes re­
covered the ball for Bethany. The op­
ponents were forced to kick. Kesner 
received the ball but fumbled it and 
Rawdon of Bethany recovered on 
Tech’s 36-yard line. Tech received 
the ball on downs and carried it the 
length of the field, Balsinger scoring 
a touchdown. Kesner failed to kick 
the goal. At this point Bethany put 
Umberhower in for Daugherty, while 
Tech substituted Troutman for Ilell- 
strom. Balsinger kicked to Rawdon, 
who returned to Bethany’s 38-yard 
line. Marshal intercepted a forward 
pass. Parke fumbled and Tylock re­
covered the ball. Tech was penalized
5 yards for offside. Marshal then made 
the star play of the day. Intercepting 
a forward pass from Rogers, he ran 
forty-five yards for a touchdown. A 
Bethany man tackled him just as he 
reached the line. Kesner kicked the 
goal. Score: Tech, 19; Bethany, 0.
Second Quarter.
Balsinger kicked off to Elder on the 
visitors’ 44-yard line. Bethany carried 
the ball up the field to Tech’s 25-yard 
line where Marshal intercepted a for­
ward pass from Rogers. Kesner then 
fumbled and Bethany recovered the 
ball. Scott, Bethany’s quarter, carried 
the ball to the Plaid’s J^-yard mark 
and Rogers crossed the goal line with 
it. He failed to kick the goal. Victor 
took Umberhower’s place at right end 
for the visitors while Levy of Tech

The Department of Dramatic Arts 
at the Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy will repeat the Three Irish Plays, 
which were staged on October the 
twenty-second under the personal di­
rection of Mr. Padraic Colum, the 
Irish Dramatist, who was formerly a 
member of the Abbey Theatre Com­
pany in Dublin.
The plays will be “The Shadow of 
the Glen” by John Millington Synge, 
Mr. Colum’s own powerful dramatic 
episode, “The Betrayal” and W. B. 
Yeats’ remarkable but rarely per­
formed fantasy, “The King’s Thres­
hold.” The Faculties of the Pittsburgh 
High and Preparatory Schools will be 
among the guests of the occasion.
The studios of the various Depart­
ments of the School of Applied Design 
will be open for inspection for those 
guests who wish to come early and 
see the work of the students.
A musical program will be arranged 
by the Department of Music. The 
chimes will announce the opening play 
which will occur promptly at 8:15 
o’clock.
On Saturday evening another per­
formance will be held for the students 
and Alumni. Tickets may be secured 
free of charge at Mr. McCorkle’s of­
fice in the Administration Building 
after Friday morning.

The game with Bethany last Satur­
day was the last of the minor contests 
on the Carnegie schedule. The five 
previous games have marked the pre­
liminary season and now we are 
swinging into the hardest and most 
important part of the 1914 year. Only 
three games remain to be played and 
then another football year will have 
passed into history; it is a year which 
no doubt will be marked by the great­
est successes encountered by any Tech 
team. We have won four victories so 
far and have lost one game by the 
slightest margin. Lehigh, the team 
that defeated us, was by no means a 
mediocre or second class aggregation 
and we can console ourselves by the 
fact that we lost to a worthy foe.
We have yet to meet Westminster, 
Pitt and Allegheny, in the order

When he addressed us in April, Mr. 
Carnegie bade us fareWell until he 
should meet us again. Within the 
past week, we have once more had the 
pleasure and privilege of greeting not 
only our founder but also his very 
sweet and charming wife. Each time 
we see him, we come more fond of 
him, but it is doubtful if we can re­
gard Mrs. Carnegie with greater es­
teem than we have since the occa­
sion of her first visit to the schools in 
the memory of the present Senior 
Class.
We have been longing for an oppor­
tunity to express in some manner, in­
adequate though it may be, a word of 
heartfelt appreciation to our founder 
and benefactor. Standing with bared 
heads, singing our “Alma Mater” or 
shouting a “long Carnegie,” as we 
did last week, for none other than the 
man who made it possible for us to 
repeat those songs and cheers, a feel­
ing of gratitude wells up within us, 
and we are led to wonder how many 
of us realize that were it not for An­
drew Carnegie our school should nev­
er have been called into being and 
we should never have enjoyed the ad­
vantages afforded by such an institu­
tion as this. We can only begin to as­
sure our dear old “Uncle Andy” that 
we are exceedingly grateful to him 
for the opportunity he has given us to 
help ourselves, a greater service than 
which no man has ever rendered to his 
fellow man.
Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie departed last 
Friday morning in apparent good 
health and spirits, to return, we hope, 
in the near future. They need never 
seek a reason for coming to Pitts­
burgh. So long as the Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology is in existence, 
they will always receive a hearty wel­
come at the hands of its students— 
their students.

During my recent visit to the Uni­
versity of Halli-Wittenberg, I picked 
up a copy of “Der Akademiker” pub­
lished there. After glancing over its 
pages, I was ready to throw it aside 
when I was attracted by the above 
caption. Thinking that a comparison 
between “commandments” there and 
here might be interesting to the stu­
dents of Carnegie, I give herewith a 
free translation:
1. Spread widely the sails of thy 
thirst for knowledge, otherwise thou 
wilt starve intellectually in thy strug­
gle for a livelihood.
2. Bury thyself in something great 
to become free from thine own small­
ness.
3. Love thy teachers as gods, and 
whomsoever thou hast found to be an 
idol, sacrifice him without mercy on 
the altar of thine independence.
4. Become a master of letters and 
not their servant. Only he who uses 
the tricks of the technique naturally 
and is master of the method, can neg­
lect them.
5. Enjoy only what thyself hast 
won; consider all other capital as 
borrowed and pay honorable interest 
therefor.
6. Seek responsibility and protec­
tion. If thou hast good luck, be 
ashamed of thine own insufficiency; 
if thou hast bad luck, embrace it as 
thy best treasure.
7. Seek friends that thou mayest 
have to offer thyself, not to use 
them for profit.
8. Love in a woman not only that 
which distinguishes her from thee, but 
above all, that which will make thy 
life more complete; and when thou 
covetest her, remember thy mother.
9. Argue with every authority, but 
always with respect; doubt dogma, but 
not God.
10. Steel thy body for the strife, 
but save thy best efforts for the peace 
and the health of thy descendants.
11. Learn to be patient and quiet­
ly to listen, that thou mayest be just 
to the weakest of thy brothers.
12. Try to do, at least so long that 
thou mayest know how difficult it is.

In his fifty word message to the 
audience of students and employees 
of the Carnegie Institute, at Carnegie 
Music Hall last Thursday afternoon, 
Dean Connellly referred to a poem 
written by a member of the Depart­
ment of Printing of the School of Ap­
plied Industries. The young student 
it seems, received his inspiration at 
the exercises for the unveiling of the 
Burn’s Memorial Statue, from the 
Scotch bard’s well known poem “A 
Man’s a Man for a’ That,” and he em­
ployed the same form of verse to set 
to words, his thoughts on one of the 
current school issues. We are glad 
to print these stanzas here, not so 
much for the value of their message 
as for the cleverness of their style 
which displays the ability of the writ­
er.
A PLEA FOR THE PLEBE 
Entitled 
A Man’s a Plebe for a’ that 
A Plebe’s a Plebe for a’ that 
A Plebe’s a Man for a’ that. 
(According to the state of your Sen­
iority, your Sophness of your 
Freshness.)
I.
Is there for honest First Year man, 
That hangs his head and a’ that 
The coward-slave, we pass him by, 
We dare be Plebes for a’ that.
For a’ that and a’ that,
We’re new and green and a’ that, 
And Class is but the guinea stamp, 
A Plebe’s a man for a’ that.
II.
What tho’ in certain bounds we dine, 
Wear Red, Blue, Green and a’ that, 
Gie up our rights to stand in line,
A Plebe’s a man for a’ that.
For a’ that and a’ that,
Their Senior rule and a’ that,
The honest Plebe, tho’ still a Plebe, 
May be a man for a’ that.
III.
Wha yills at ilka footbaw game,
An’ helps his team a-scorin’,
Gies up his dime for blankets fine, 
An’ Sings and Cheer-r-r-s and a’ that? 
For a’ that and a’ that,
Their dignities and a’ that,
Ye Sophs and Juniors, are ye sure 
A man’s a Plebe for a’ that?
IV.
Ha’ ye no pity in yer hearts,
Ye men o’ Upper Classes,
When wi’ disdain, Ye call aloud,
“Get out, Ye Plebe!” and a’ that?
For a’ that and a’ that,
Yer rights (and lefts) and a’ that, 
Are ye so sure—ye Upper men,
A Plebe’s a Plebe, for a’ that.
V.
Then let’s expec’, within the Tech, 
There’ll come a day for a’ that,
That Fellowship will take a grip, 
And make us one for a’ that.
For a’ that and a’ that,
It’s cornin’ yet for a’ that,
That Class to Class, and School to 
School,
“OLD TECH” comes first, for a’ that.

ING AN oNGINooRING 
J.URNAL.
Pittsburgh, Pa., Oct. 31, ’14. 
Editor of The Tartan:
In your issue of The Tartan 
week before last appeared an ar­
ticle, written by a Junior Science 
student, who, imbued with pro­
found loyalty to his Alma Mater, 
seeks to advance its reputation and 
encourage original engineering work 
among the students, by the issue of 
an engineering journal. It is recog­
nized that before taking such a step 
serious thought must be given to the 
idea to credit or discredit its advisa­
bility. That the motive of Mr. Res­
nick is unquestionably praiseworthy is 
self-evident, and his optimism is like­
wise congratulatory, but on carefully
considering the various points in­
volved there appears unfortunately, 
several weak yet vital points.
And that these weak and vital 
points lie within the very elements, 
which Mr. Resnick mentions as the 
success of the proposed journal, is 
discouraging. To be successful we 
must have contributions (to the liter­
ature) and subscriptions. Subscrip­
tions enough to make the Journal a 
self-supporting publication “from the 
start” is absolutely necessary. To ig­
nore this and to depend upon the Stu­
dents’ Activity Fund, would be start­
ing a pernicious habit, both unwise 
and unscholarly. Whether we can ob­
tain 600 subscriptions, which the pro­
moter mentions as necessary, from a 
sum total of Day and Night Students, 
Faculty and Alumni, of 1300, is doubt­
ful. Students who have had experi­
ences in subscription work will no 
doubt verify this assertion.
Taking up the matter of contribu­
tions to the literature, I note that Mr. 
Resnick mentions six sources. Contri­
butions from the Alumni would prob­
ably prove most interesting to the 
students, but it is evident that with 
only 429 Alumni the number of such 
articles would be few and this point 
of interest would be thus weakened. 
Contributions from students engaged 
in practical work, especially from 
Night Students, Would be few, thus 
another weak spot. Such students 
have little or no time to do original 
research, many occupy only subordi­
nate positions, thus being denied in­
formation, and the others would, in 
many cases, be withheld from publish­
ing results while in the employ of a 
second party. The printed addresses 
of lecturers, in my opinion, would not 
prove alluring to students, who have 
already heard same, and to copy cur­
rent literature would only be a means 
of covering up a lack of articles for 
the publication. Besides, the real stu­
dent has, no doubt, read the current 
literature. Thus the interest in the 
publication would dwindle down to the 
articles by the faculty and to the 
theses printed.
Whether this will be enough to make 
the proposition worth while depends 
entirely upon our students. It seems 
to me that the idea is too premature. 
If you will investigate I think it will 
be seen that many engineering publi­
cations issued by universities, are 
worthless because of the weaknesses 
mentioned herein, and if we wish to 
have as successful a publication as that 
of Cornell and others, I think the 
matter should be kept in mind until a 
later date—until such a time when we 
will be able to boast of many and 
successful Alumni, of a research de­
partment, many postgraduate stu­
dents, and a larger enrollment -in the 
school.
These are my views, after careful 
consideration. They seem as pessi­
mistic as the originator’s are optimis­
tic, but if they will lead to interest in 
the idea, probably a way may be found 
to remove defects, and the- article will 
have served its purpose to good ad­
vantage. It occurs to me that a 
“quarterly” journal might be a remedy.
Respectfully,
Morris Block, Night Science.

.n Account of the Inclemency 
of the Weather.
Ceremonies attendant upon the un­
veiling and presentation to the City of 
Pittsburgh of a memorial to Robert 
Burns were held in the Carnegie Mu­
sic Hall at 3 o’clock, Tuesday after­
noon, October 27. Andrew Carnegie 
was the chief figure on the program, 
delivering the presentation address.
Preparations had been completed 
for an open-air program, but on ac­
count of the inclemency of the weath­
er, it was impossible to carry out the 
original plans. The unveiling, with 
a short speech by J. Massey Rhind 
and the singing of Auld Lang Syne 
were the only events to occur in the 
open.
The students of Tech marched to 
the hall in a body, preceded by the 
school band. Besides the students, 
there was a large crowd assembled 
in the auditorium to hear the dis­
tinguished speakers on the program. 
Andrew McLean, editor-in-chief of 
the “Brooklyn Citizen,” delivered the 
principal oration of the afternoon. He 
was followed by Mr. Carnegie, who 
delivered the presentation address. 
Mayor Joseph Armstrong, who was 
one of the guests of honor at the 
exercises, responded with an accept­
ance in behalf of the city. After the 
introduction of J. Massey Rhind, the
sculptor, the audience and disting­
uished guests adjourned to the site of 
the memorial, where the statue was 
unveiled and “Auld Lang Syne sung.
The program, with Rev. Dr. Robert 
Christie presiding, was as follows:

The Burns memorial is an expres­
sion of the incident, which inspired 
Robert Burns to write his poem “To 
a Mountain Daisy.” Clad in the garb 
of the highland farmer, the figure of 
Burns stands at the plow, one hand 
resting upon it. He is depicted as 
having just picked up a mountain 
daisy, uprooted by his plow. With 
right arm extended he gazes at the 
daisy with an air of deep meditation. 
The sculptor has not over-idealized
his subject. He has presented the 
romantic figure of Burns first as he 
must have appeared to stranger eyes, 
rough, uncouth, but all aflame with 
divine inspiration.
UNIQUE MASS MEETING
Continued from Page 1 
may well imagine that the audience 
enjoyed every word he said, and 
wished that it could only be our good 
fortune to hear Mr. Carnegie oftener 
than we have in the past. Mr. Car­
negie was followed by Mrs. Carnegie. 
It was the first time that the majority 
of the audience had ever had the pleas­
ure of hearing Mrs. Carnegie speak. 
To say how quickly she won the 
hearts of the audience is impossible, 
but it might be appropriate to say that 
there is nothing that the students will 
ever enjoy more than the pleasure of 
again having Mrs. Carnegie address 
them.
“Uncle John” was not to be forgot­
ten, and after much coaxing he finally 
consented to say his “few words,” and 
as always is the case those few words 
were well worth listening to. Mr. 
Charles Heinroth then followed with 
an organ selection at the end of which 
the audience joined in singing 
“America,” and the meeting adjourned.

Roosevelt might employ that Petro­

Very few students realize the tre­
mendous struggle now going on for 
the chess championship. The supre­
macy of last year’s champion, Mr. H. 
Horelick, is in danger.
Although Mr. Horelick won quite 
handily last year, it is the opinion of 
the experts that he'will have quite a 
time of it this season, as he will be 
hard pressed by Mr. C. T. Patterson, 
who originated the tournaments and 
who is an expert player.
Up to the present time Mr. Hore­
lick has won 5 games and has lost 1 
game. Mr. Patterson has won 2 
games and lost 5 games. To the a s­
tonishment of many a dark horse is 
appearing in the person of S. Domous. 
Last year Mr. Domous did not place 
at all but he seems to have picked up 
quite a bit of ches§, and it looks as if 
he will be heard from this year.

ANVRoW CARNoGIo VISITS 
l. l. C. S.
A deep and unusual undercurrent 
of excitement was felt in the school 
all the week of Mr. Carnegie’s visit, 
but it was stronger and more notice­
able on Wednesday, the day of his 
actual visit to l. l. C. S. The pre­
ceding days had been busily spent in 
arranging and preparing things for 
his coming, but at last, everything 
was ready and all were impatiently 
awaiting his arrival.
Mr. Carnegie came from the Central 
Building, walking over to the Mar­
garet Morrison School through a path, 
bordered on both sides by a double 
row of the students. As he passed, 
cheers arose, hats were doffed, and 
everywhere exclamations of delight 
filled the air. When the rotunda of 
the school was reached, Mr. and Mrs. 
Carnegie, in company with the rest 
of the party and Dean Breed, who 
came out to welcome them, paused for 
a moment, while several enterprising 
reporters snapped their pictures, and 
the students, under the direction of 
the cheer-leader, gave three or four 
rousing cheers. The party then pro­
ceeded into the school. Just inside 
the door, Mr. Carnegie paused to say 
a few kindly words to a group of girls 
standing there, and then with the 
others went upstairs, where lunch 
was waiting in the “Little House.” 
It was prepared and served by the 
girls taking the Institutional Man­
ager’s Course offered by the House­
hold Economics Department, and 
Louise McMillan acted as hostess. 
Those present were Mr. and Mrs. Car­
negie, Miss Lauder, Mr. Lauder, Mrs. 
Church, Mrs. Frew, Mrs. Holland, 
Dean Breed, Mrs. McConway, Mrs. 
Hamerschlag, Miss Lyon and the 
hostess.
Immediately after lunch, assembly 
was called. While waiting for Mr. 
Carnegie to appear the girls sang the 
school songs, and as he entered, gave 
the Margaret Morrison School cheer. 
Then, after being introduced to “his 
girls” as Dean Breed appropriately 
put it, Mr. Carnegie naively began, 
“Well, girls,—” and then paused to 
look around at the girls’ faces with a 
gentle smile lighting his happy face. 
He went on to say that Mrs. Carnegie 
claimed half of the ownership, and 
that she joined him in wishing the 
well-being of the girls, for even from 
the first, her heart, as well as his own 
had been with the work of the women 
here, and that they both heartily be­
lieved a very great deal depended on 
the education of women. Mr. Car­
negie then continued and gave an inci­
dent that occurred when he was talk­
ing to the mandarins in China, and 
he repeated to the girls what he had 
told those high officials that he firmly 
believed the greatest work that Christ 
accomplished was the elevation of 
women. In this, he said, China was 
the farthest behind, while America, to 
his mind, was beyond all others. The 
latter country alone realized that the 
greatest progress is made by the edu­
cation of women. Our founder then 
went on to say, he hoped that all the 
girls, after a special training and prop­
er development, would marry, for only 
by this way, he concluded, could one 
be sure that man would participate in 
woman’s elevation.
Dean Breed then introduced Mrs. 
Carnegie, who, although she did not 
speak, rose and smiled in her winning 
way, while applause sounded loud and 
long.
The girls then sang a song, com­
posed by Miss Stoner, to Mr. Car­
negie, and the assembly was closed 
with a cheer for Mrs. Carnegie. After 
a short reception for the teachers to 
meet Mr. and Mrs. carnegie, they left 
for the Design School, where the stu­
dents of the Dramatic Course gave a 
play in their honor.

With the erection of our new build­
ing, the space for the Science Depart­
ment has been greatly enlarged. On 
the ground floor, there is a large Sci­
ence Lecture Room, Science Supply 
Room, two chemical laboratories, a 
Bacteriological Laboratory and a Bi­
ological Laboratory. These labora­
tories are large, well lighted rooms, 
and when completed will be splendidly
PR.F. J. o. RUSH
equipped for scientific work.
Besides the addition in space the 
department has grown otherwise. 
New courses in scientific subjects 
have been introduced this year in ad­
dition to those previously given.
Since Dr. Sill left the school last 
year Dean Breed has been acting 
head of the department. Professor J.
E. Rush of Boston, is in charge of 
the Biological work. Professor Rush 
has held a number of responsible po­
sitions, and we feel very fortunate in 
having him as an instructor in our 
college.
Professor Rush was at one time 
chemist and bacteriologist in charge 
of the water supply at Springfield, 
Mass. From here he went to Wal­
pole and East Walpole, and did sani­
tary inspection work on the board 
of health. He had charge of the in­
stallation of the water plant at La­
conia, New Hampshire, and later of 
Bellmont, Mass. He was the assist­
ant of Prof. Sedgwick at Massachu­
setts Institute of Technology in the 
Department of Chemistry, Biology 
and Public Health, and for a while 
was connected with the Boston Bio- 
Chemical Laboratories. Later he was 
instructor in Bacteriology at the 
University of Wisconsin. While 
there he did research work on cold 
storage, especially in reference to 
eggs—and on ptomains. Dr. Harper, 
chief health officer and chairman of 
the Board of Health of Wisconsin, 
secured Prof. Rush to make a sani­
tary survey of the State of Wisconsin. 
He also worked upon the problem of 
sewage disposal at Fond du Lac.
This semester Prof. Rush is direct­
ing courses in General Biology, Gen­
eral Bacteriology, Sanitary Science 
and Public Health and Diseases of 
Occupations. Next semester the 
work will consist of courses in The­
oretical Biology and Advanced Bac­
teriology with emphasis laid on water 
and milk supplies, and Epidemiology.
Dean Breed is giving a course in 
History of Science. This course is re­
quired of students specializing in gen­
eral science, and may be elected by 
Seniors in other departments.
The department proposes to en­
large the course to include courses 
not given at present. In the future 
students specializing in Science may 
be able to major in one or two of 
the above mentioned sciences. The 
idea is to prepare women to do public 
health work for which there is a 
large field, and to fit them for lab­
oratory assistants. A teacher’s 
course in General Science is also 
given.
The students specializing in the 
teacher’s course in General Science 
get their practice work in our own 
school by assisting with the lower 
classes and the night school.

Saturday night the M. M. C. S. Dor­
mitory resembled, indeed, the abode 
of witches and goblins, when the girls 
gave a fancy costume Hallowe’en 
Dance. The house was appropriately 
decorated with lighted pumpkin-faces, 
lanterns, and crepe paper shades, 
while the mantels were banked with 
cornstalks and autumn foliage. Mr. 
and Mrs. Esquerre, Mr. Rush, and 
Mr. Field were the guests of honor. 
All were masked at the beginning, and 
when identities were finally disclosed, 
great shouts of laughter rose, as one

An appropriate Hallowe’en lunch was 
served, and great credit is due Miss 
Clark who acted as general chairman.

INToRoSTING LoCTURo 
.N WAR.
What was considered a most elo­
quent, fiery and instructive talk on 
the present war situation was admir­
ably rendered Monday morning to the 
Industries students by Mr. Furna­
jieff, president of the Christian Herald 
Relief Society, in Room 104. The au­
ditorium was filled to capacity by both 
students and instructors, and the pre­
sentation of a new theory of war to 
the listeners filled them with an in­
terest which held their attention until 
the last word was uttered.
In the course of his lecture, Mr. 
Furnajieff gave a review of his per­
sonal experiences as representative of 
the Christian Herald Relief Society, in 
the Balkan War and the instances he 
related as to the effect of war on the 
civilization of all countries engaged, 
were astounding. “This war,” he 
said, “Is not a war of civilization; 
there is not a shadow of semblance 
of civilization by which one nation 
can discriminate as to which of its 
enemies is the more civilized; it is not 
a result of a social revolution; it is 
not a war for liberty, nor a war for 
the advancement of science, for it is 
destroying the organization and the­
ory for the advancement of science. 
The present war is the result of a 
growing desire on the part of each na­
tion to obtain the upper hand over its 
enemies in the matter of trade.”
The actions of the soldiers of all 
countries, their pillaging, their ambi­
tions, their thirst for blood, are all 
bound up, Mr. Furnajieff claims, in 
one round of savagery. The terrible 
effect of modern armament was illus­
trated grimly in the presentation of an 
imaginary picture of a whole squad 
of men annihilated by the explosion 
of a shell, of the terrible upheaval of 
ground, burying numberless soldiers 
under it, of the curses, moans, and 
prayers uttered by the dying and 
wounded.
“War,” he continued, “is a time for 
official lies. At the last Balkan War, 
there was much said that was true 
and a great deal more that was not 
true. An instance was presented when 
the king of Greece signed a statement 
to the effect that the Turks had killed 
the bishop of a little Grecian city, Du- 
rain, and, when the truth came out, the 
bishop was still employed working 
among his people. Another statement 
was issued in which a town of 1500 
inhabitants was supposed to have been 
entirely wiped out, but after the com­
mission serving under Mr. Carnegie’s 
Peace Foundation investigated the 
matter, it was found that only a small 
part of the villagers were killed. Such 
statements,” Mr. Furnajieff continued, 
“are signed by kings in view of their 
utter lack of proof. Similar condi­
tions are in existence today. The 
Germans are issuing statements con­
trary to those of the Russian goverri- 
ment and the Russian government is 
issuing statements denied in German 
military circles. Between the two, the
official lie seems to hold full sway.” 
In closing his lecture, Mr. Furna­
jieff strongly interpreted the feelings 
of all European nations, and he com­
mended the splendid attitude taken 
by our President, Woodrow Wilson, 
toward whom all eyes are turning 
for a solution of the war difficulties 
which will result in an era of peace 
and prosperity.

The committee in charge of the ar­
rangements for the dance to be given 
to the Plebes by the joint Upper and 
Middle classes, is very much on the 
job preparing for this event which 
promises to be one of foremost of the 
year. The upper floor of the Central 
Building will be at their disposal Fri­
day evening, November 20th, from 
eight until one, and this fact coupled 
with an elaborate decorating scheme 
and Nirella’s orchestra, bids well to 
assure all students and their friends, 
an unusually gay time.
This affair will be a new departure, 
the main object of which is to better 
acquaint first year students of the 
school with the men in the upper and 
middle classes. Party line's are to be 
dispensed with and the Plebe may 
address the Senior with an abandon 
which only a Plebe can possess. All 
students are requested to attend and 
a general good time can be looked 
forward to.
During the coming week it is ex­
pected that a Literary Society will be 
organized among those taking the 
Teachers’ Course. A committee has 
been appointed to draw up a consti­
tution. All members of the Teachers’ 
Course will be eligible to membership.

During the coming week at the Al­

MacKay” will hold forth.
The story is that of a modern Cin­
derella. Kitty is a little Scotch lassie 
who has been brought up in the High­
lands by a spiteful old couple, who, 
although well paid to take care of the 
child, have made of her a household 
slave. On her eighteenth birthday 
Kitty is sent for by her guardian to 
come and live with him in London. 
In a very short time Kitty falls deeply 
in love with her guardian's son, a 
lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards, 
but because of a mystery surrounding 
her birth cannot marry him.
The perplexed and heartbroken girl 
returns to her old home in the High­
lands to escape from her first great 
sorrow. She is soon followed by her 
soldier-lover and his guardian when 
the mystery surrounding her birth is 
cleared and the happy young lovers 
are reunited.

Joseph W. Smith, Painter, Tells 
About Tombs.
The Science general lecture on 
Wednesday morning, Oct. 28th, con­
sisted of the personal experiences of 
Mr. Joseph William Smith, architect 
and painter of the art of the past. In 
his talk he told about the present 
mode of excavation in Egypt, and es­
pecially about one tomb which he was 
the first to enter after a period of 
3500 years.
According to Mr. Smith, it is only 
recenly that the work on excavating 
the tombs of Egypt has been put un­
der government control and regula­
tion, so that nothing found may be 
now taken out of the country without 
special permission. Previously to the 
present century no scientific record of 
the relics was made.
The excavations are made by indi­
viduals; anyone with the money to 
finance a “dig” may do so, but all he 
may get out of it is the pleasure of 
finding something for the Egyptian 
government. Although labor may be 
had for five cents a day, the digging 
is expensive, for a scholar who can 
read the hieroglyphics and also an 
interpreter who can speak English and 
Arabic must be hired.
The manner in which the natives 
work was described by the speaker 
as “a very leisurely way.” Using 
short handled hoes which require a 
great amount of back bending, the 
gang of Arabs will stand with legs 
spread and half fill a basket about the 
size of a strawberry box with the de­
bris of the accumulated rubbish of 
centuries. Then the basket must be 
lifted on the head of the boy who 
tends each laborer. This stirs up a 
cloud of dust which must be allowed 
to settle before more work can be 
done. Finally the boys are started on 
a run to the immense dumps which are 
placed about the dig. The extreme 
slowness of such methods is due to the 
fact that the natives will not tolerate 
any modern machinery such as the 
steam shovel.
One of the hardest things is to get 
workmen who will not steal every­
thing that they find. Any small ob­
ject an Arab will find he will always 
try to steal, and the way in which they 
will contrive to let their turban drop 
over it and then bind it against their 
head was described by Mr. Smith.
An account of how he entered a 
newly found tomb which was just 
as robbers had left it 3500 years 
ago, made up the latter part 
of his address. After eight days dig­
ging on a flight of stairs of which the 
upper stone was by fortune uncov­
ered, the stone entrance to the tomb 
was reached. This was walled up but 
for a little hole at the top which had 
been the exit for the last visitors. A 
small boy was put in here and rigjit 
on the inside was a prince’s staff, a 
pair of slippers, a large scarab or beetle 
beautifully inscribed, a broken chariot
yoke tipped with gold, and a funeral 
wreath of onions as old as the tomb. 
These had probably been abandoned 
by the robbers through fear of spirits 
for the Egyptians are very supersti­
tious about the ghosts of their dead.
After passing down the half dozen 
or so flights of stairs that led to the 
mummy room, they came upon the 
final room cut from the living rock 
and about nine by twelve by thirty 
feet in size. The robbers who had 
been in the tomb shortly after the 
burial had left this room in a state of 
chaos, which it was impossible to 
photograph on account of the entan­
glement.
Here for the only time in the lec­
ture the artist nature showed itself 
as he described this scene as a mass 
of deep blacks, and gold, and silver, 
without a particle of dust. - In this 
room inside of three coffins in each 
of two separate Cedar of Lebanon 
chests nine by twelve by seven feet 
were found the mummies of two kings 
of 3500 years ago. The sides of the 
chests had been broken by the rob­
bers, whose objective had been the 
jewelry of the corpses which was miss­
ing. There was still an alabastar jar 
with three inches of a liquid in it 
which Mr. Smith said tasted like bad 
cylinder oil. It took three weeks of 
hard work to get everything out of 
this tomb.

WESTMINSTER NEXT SATURDAY
Continued from Page 1
named. These games are of the most 
vital importance, especially the West­
minster contest, because if we are 
able to cope successfully with the New 
Wilmington eleven we will go into 
the Pitt game with a lot of confidence.
Westminster has met some of the 
best teams in this end of the state. 
Penn State defeated them, 13-0, the 
scores coming very late in the game 
and only after the up-staters had been 
outplayed in the early stages. Pitt 
defeated Westminster 21-10 and again 
the score does not show the true re­
sistance offered by the team we are 
to meet Saturday. W. & J.’s power­
ful eleven crushed Westminster by a 
28-0 score. While Westminster was 
defeated by these three elevens, their 
showing was indeed impressive, judg­
ing from the manner in which W. & J., 
State and Pitt have been treating the 
big teams of the country. They are 
dangerous foes and have a fast heavy 
team with several individual stars. 
Last Saturday, Westminster, in the 
presence of a special Carnegie dele­
gate, defeated Geneva, 6-3, and at the 
same time provided us with some very 
valuable information.
All of the Plaid cripples will be back 
in the game and Carnegie will present 
her full strength. “Bull” Crawford 
will again be seen at left tackle and 
Oeffinger will be holding down the 
fullback position when the whistle 
blows. The team has been run through 
a strenuous week and all the prepara­
tions possible have been made. for 
this game. Tech intends to give the 
best that is in them and every man is 
prepared to fight to the finish.
An important change has been made 
in the starting time of the game. The 
whistle for the opening of hostilities 
will blow at 1:30. This change has 
been made so that it will be possible 
to let our boys see Pitt in action and 
ultimately to learn some of the tricks 
they will be up against on the follow­
ing Saturday. The management felt 
sure that the student body would not 
object to this change, especially be­
cause of the aid it may serve our team. 
SO DON’T FORGET, NOW, SAT­
URDAY AT 1:30 AT TECH FIELD. 
A big time and a real football game, 
not at 3 o’clock but at 1:30.

Parke on Tech’s 10-yard line and the 
Plaid halfback returned the ball 7

ORATORICAL CONTESTS OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE 
ASSOCIATION.
In a letter to the Department of Pub­
lic Speaking the executive secretary 
of the Pennsylvania Arbitration and 
Peace Society requests the professors 
of that department to endeavor to se­
cure a number of students to enter the 
oratorical contest held by the society. 
The usual prizes of $75 and $50 will be 
awarded for orations on some, phase 
of the international peace question. 
All students interested in such a con­
test may receive the full details, which 
were too lengthy to publish, from the 
English Department of the Science 
School. This year with the interest of 
the world centered upon war, and with 
a clear picture of the blessings of 
peace, drawn before our eyes, every 
college in Pennsylvania should be rep­
resented in the competition. Let Car­
negie be no exception.
