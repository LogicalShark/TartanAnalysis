OLI granted web-based
JENNIFER THARP
Staffwriter
In recognition of the Open 
Learning Initiative’s dedica­
tion to educational opportu­
nities, the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation, Lumina 
Foundation for Education, 
and the Hewlett Foundation 
awarded the OLI with $4 mil­
lion in grants to expand upon 
its work.
The Open Learning Initia­
tive began at Carnegie Mellon 
in 2002 with the goal of cre­
ating online courses based on 
cognitive science. “We bring 
together teams of faculty 
experts — in statistics, engi­
neering, and chemistry, for 
example — with software en­
gineers, with learning science 
researchers, and human-com- 
puter interactions scientists 
and we develop web-based 
learning environments: OLIs,” 
said Candace Thille, the direc­
tor of the OLI.
The ideal purpose was for 
a student not attending Carn­
egie Mellon to be able to take 
the course with the same level 
of success as a traditional 
student. “The goal was that 
a learner new to the subject 
could go online and receive 
the complete performance 
of instruction for the course 
— they could learn what 
the courses were designed 
to teach using just the OLI 
course,” said Joel Smith, Car­
negie Mellon’s vice provost 
and chief information officer.
Faculty, cognitive scien-
$4 million to develop learning environments
tists, and human-computer 
interaction experts worked to­
gether to set up this program 
that not only provided valu­
able courses but also feedback 
to its creators. By studying 
the effects of online courses 
in and out of the classroom, 
researchers at both Carnegie 
Mellon and the Pittsburgh 
Science of Learning Center 
can determine if the courses 
increase learning. Several 
online courses are used in 
Carnegie Mellon classrooms 
today. For example, in the 
online courses, students can 
even mix chemical reactions 
as if in a real laboratory and 
receive feedback throughout 
the process.
“After careful design, as­
sessment, and redesign, the 
evidence shows that OLI 
course materials, particularly 
when they are used as part of 
[a] ‘mixed mode’ of instruc­
tion that uses OLI materials 
but also in-person instruc­
tion, do improve learning out­
comes,” Smith said.
Early in the experiment, 
students at Carnegie Mellon 
were invited to take Statistical 
Reasoning (36-201) as part 
of an accelerated learning 
course. Their results showed 
that course time could be re­
duced from the traditional 15 
weeks with three lectures a 
week to eight weeks with two 
lectures a week. To eliminate 
outside variables, the experi­
ment was repeated in 2006 
and 2009. “The learning gains 
of the students who used the
online course were at least 
as good, and usually better, 
than those who attended the 
traditional course,” said Oded 
Meyer, director of undergrad­
uate studies in the statistics 
department.
The OLI at Carnegie Mel­
lon is currently working with 
community college faculty 
across the country to imple­
ment online courses. Closer to 
campus, there will be experi­
ments with Computing at Car­
negie Mellon as part of an OLI 
program in summer 2010..
“This could only have 
happened at Carnegie Mel­
lon because of the history of 
working across departments 
and bringing together experts 
across traditional college 
boundaries,” Thille said.

Universities respond to failing economy, adjust curricula
ELLEN TWORKÚSKI
Staffwriter
For much of the country, 
economic turmoil can be seen 
in the way that many uni­
versities have been forced to 
adjust academic curricula in 
response to the changing job 
market. Decreased enrollment 
in certain programs and a lack 
of funds have forced institu­
tions such as the University of 
Louisiana and Michigan State 
University to eliminate majors 
such as philosophy, American 
studies, and classics, while 
focusing on those majors that 
lead directly to a job. However, 
despite these national trends,
Carnegie Mellon has proven 
to be an exception by keeping 
its broad academic program 
mostly intact and helping stu­
dents to find careers in a wide 
variety of areas.
Although many universi­
ties have seen a shift in student 
interest toward more technical 
fields that recently have had a 
better job market, Carnegie 
Mellon has seen high applica­
tion volumes and enrollments 
in all of its colleges. According 
to Michael Steidel, the direc­
tor of admission at Carnegie 
Mellon, application increases 
for this year range from 11 
percent to 19 percent, with 
the largest increases seen in
the Mellon College of Science 
and the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology (19 percent and 
17 percent, respectively).
Part of the reason Carn­
egie Mellon has been able 
to retain a wide spectrum of 
programs is due to its funding 
sources. According to Indira 
Nair, the vice provost of edu­
cation at Carnegie Mellon, 
about half of the university’s 
operating expenses are drawn 
from tuition payments while 
grants and monetary awards 
received by faculty make up 
another significant portion of 
the university’s funding. Only

Tuition tax will not be pursued
SABRINA PORTER
Personnel Manager
As a new semester begins, 
the city of Pittsburgh contin­
ues to search for a way to fill 
its budget void. Mayor Luke 
Ravenstahl announced Dec. 
21 the end of the city’s pur­
suit of the “fair-share” tuition 
tax on Pittsburgh’s college 
students, leaving a $15 mil­
lion budget hole unresolved. 
The state has proposed a new 
solution through a statewide
property tax and service fee 
for all nonprofit organizations, 
including all of Pennsylvania’s 
colleges. Like the tuition tax, 
this proposal has already been 
met with criticism from Pitts­
burgh colleges.
The original proposed 
“fair-share tax” would have 
added a 1 percent tax on tu­
ition from each of Pittsburgh’s 
colleges, or about $400 to 
Carnegie Mellon’s annual tu­
ition. It was proposed in order 
to fill a void in the city budget
for pensions and the Carnegie 
Library of Pittsburgh system. 
If enacted, it would have been 
the first tax on college tuition 
in any city in the nation.
Students were relieved to 
hear that the tax was officially 
off the table.
“I’m glad that we pre­
vailed, and I’m very grateful 
that the city council stood up 
to [the mayor],” said Natalie 
Morris, a sophomore physics

David Tepper 
earns $7 billion
JACKSON LANE
Staffwriter
For most people at Car­
negie Mellon, Tepper is the 
name of our school of busi­
ness, but on Wall Street, Da­
vid Alan Tepper is consid­
ered one of the best hedge 
fund managers in the Unit­
ed States.
In its annual earnings 
report, Tepper’s hedge fund 
firm, Appaloosa Manage­
ment, recorded about $7 
billion in profits in 2009, 
making it the highest-per- 
forming hedge fund firm in 
2009. Tepper himself will 
take home a well-earned 
$2.5 billion bonus for his 
performance and leader­
ship.
But Tepper’s success can 
also be considered to be a 
sign of much broader eco­
nomic recovery. While the 
collapse of former giants 
like Bank of America and 
Citigroup in early 2009 sent 
most investors running, 
Tepper consistently bought 
the banks’ then-almost 
-worthless shares.
By the end of March, 
shares in Bank of America 
alone accounted for more 
than 60 percent of Appaloo- 
sa’s portfolio. While his in­
vestment tactics perplexed 
and worried many of his 
peers and clients, Tepper 
was making a bet on eco­
nomic recovery to revitalize 
these banks.
His bet paid off, and 
by September 2009, Bank 
of America and Citigroup 
shares increased 330 per­
cent and 223 percent, re­
spectively.
“David Tepper’s recent 
success should most of all 
teach students that confi­
dence in one’s judgment is 
more important in making 
risk-based decisions than 
the consensus of opinions 
by experts and pundits,” 
said Milton Cofield, execu­
tive director of the under­
graduate business program 
at Carnegie Mellon.
Risky investments are 
where Tepper has had the 
most success over his career. 
After earning his MBA from 
Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate 
School of Industrial Admin­
istration in 1982, Tepper 
joined the treasury depart­
ment at then-struggling Re­
public Steel in Ohio. After 
the company was bought 
by the LTV Corporation 
in 1984, Tepper became a 
credit analyst at Keystone 
Funds located in Boston, 
and in 1985, he joined the 
research department at 
Goldman Sachs, working in 
the newly established high- 
yield bond group.
In general, high-yield 
bonds, or “junk” bonds, 
are characterized by their 
low investment grades at 
the time of purchase, and 
thus typically offer higher 
yields to attract investors. 
In the 1980s, most high- 
yield bonds were thought of 
as “fallen angels,” or bonds 
that were originally issued 
with an investment grade 
rating, but had since been 
downgraded to a lower rat­
ing due to financial troubles 
at the issuing company. By 
the end of 1986, Tepper 
was the head of the high- 
yield bond desk at Goldman 
Sachs. In 1992, he left Gold­
man Sachs to start Appaloo­
sa Management.
“I think after being 
passed over for partner too 
many times, he just quit 
and started doing his own 
thing,” senior economics 
major Luke Johnson said.

Born in 1922, David Lewis 
served in the Navy in World 
War II. An architect and urban 
designer, Lewis came to the 
Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology in 1963 as the Andrew 
Mellon professor of architec­
ture and urban design, where 
he started an educational pro­
gram in urban design where 
students worked hands-on 
with elected officials, agency 
representatives, and citizens 
in communities in the Pitts­
burgh metropolitan region.
From 1968 to 1974, he 
taught at Yale, where he was 
the William Henry Bishop 
professor of urban design and 
formed the Yale Urban De­
sign Workshop. In 1988-89, 
he was the Hyde professor at 
the University of Nebraska. 
In 1990, he returned to Car­
negie Mellon and started the 
Urban Laboratory, which still 
exists today.
In the late ’60s and early 
’70s, he was a core member 
of the American Institute of 
Architects’ (AIA) Regional/ 
Urban Design Assistance 
Teams (R/UDATs), and was 
chairman of the ALA’s Nation­
al Urban Design Committee 
in 1976-77. In 1976, he was 
a founding member of the In­
ternational Institute of Urban 
Design.
Lewis is the founder of Ur­
ban Design Associates (UDA), 
a renowned urban design firm 
that practices in the spirit of 
participatory design.

In a competitive job market, universities adjust academics
Travis Wolfe/Photo Staff 
Due to a struggling economy, programs such as anthropology and 
political science have been reduced to the point where it is difficult for 
students to complete majors in these areas.
' COLLEGE, from A1
nonprofits
hind us, we look forward to 
working with the city to ad­
dress its fiscal problems and to 
restore Pittsburgh’s forward 
momentum,” Cohon stated.
With the tax pursuit offi­
cially over, the state has now 
stepped in. Senate Bill 1175 
would institute a tax on non­
profit organizations based 
on their amount of property, 
as well as an essential ser­
vices fee. A hearing on the 
proposed bill was held last 
Tuesday with the Pennsylva­
nia Senate Democratic Policy 
Committee.
The Pittsburgh Council of 
Higher Education (PCHE) im­
mediately spoke out against 
the bill. Carnegie Mellon is in 
line with this position. Cohon 
and Pittsburgh Theological 
Seminary President William 
Carl put out a press release on 
behalf of the PCHE on Jan. 12 
expressing their views.
. “The legislation is ground­
ed in two false perceptions,” 
they stated. “The first false 
perception is that colleges 
and universities drain servic­
es while providing no return 
to the city.... The second false 
perception is that expanding 
universities are converting 
tax-bearing property to tax- 
exempt status, eroding Penn­
sylvania’s tax base.”
The press release cited leg­
islation supporting the tax- 
exempt status of nonprofit 
organizations. It mentioned 
legislation dating back to the 
Commonwealth’s constitu­
tion, adopted in 1874, as well 
as the more recent Pennsylva­
nia Act 55 of 1997.
“While we acknowledge 
that our government leaders 
need to find a way to stabilize 
our city’s finances, taxing col­
leges and universities is not a 
good way,” said Teresa Thom­
as, assistant vice president for 
media relations at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Thomas, Carnegie Mellon, 
and the PCHE remain com­
mitted to the opposition of 
the tax.
a very small portion of the 
operating budget, approxi­
mately 4.6 percent, according 
to Nair, is drawn from endow­
ment funds — the funding 
area which has seen the larg­
est drop in recent years.
In addition, the univer­
sity’s decentralized nature 
allows individual academic 
departments to choose how 
they would like to cut ex­
penses. According to Nair, in 
most cases, these changes do 
not result in the elimination 
of entire programs, but rather 
result in the removal of sever­
al elective courses. However, 
programs such as anthropol­
ogy and political science, 
which already had small de­
partments and relied on ad­
junct faculty members, have 
seen significant reductions to 
the point where it is now dif­
ficult to complete a major in 
these areas.
Although, for the most part 
Carnegie Mellon has man­
aged to avoid cuts, it has still 
been subject to the increased 
pressure from students and 
concerned parents to deliver 
an education which will help 
graduates find a job. Howev­
er, Nair stresses that in order
to find the perfect career, it is 
not necessary for students to 
focus on a specific major—re­
gardless of how tough the job 
market may be.
“If you can find things you 
like and skills you are good 
with, it may lead you in a 
brand new direction,” she 
said. Nair advises students to 
explore new areas that may 
spark additional interests and 
allow for the development of 
new skill sets. She stated that 
the contribution of these ex­
periences can allow students
to discover “what kind of 
thinker and writer they are 
and what visions they have. 
These are some of the skills 
which employers want.”
Gina Casalegno, assistant 
dean and interim director at 
the Carnegie Mellon Career 
Center, agreed with Nair in 
that these skills may help 
students stand out. “Getting 
involved in student organiza­
tions, participating in com­
munity service opportunities, 
being part of an athletic team, 
and engaging beyond the cur­
riculum all provide real-world 
experiences that enhance [the 
student’s] candidacy for any 
prospective employer,” Casa­
legno said.
While universities have 
been forced to adjust curricu­
la in response to the job mar­
ket, students at Carnegie Mel­
lon will be pleased to learn 
that the university has been 
able to retain the majority of 
its offerings. By keeping op­
tions open, expanding one’s 
focus, and taking advantage 
of the programs that Carnegie 
Mellon has to offer, it may be 
possible to find that dream 
job yet — even in an unsteady 
economy.

Senate bill would tax
TUITION, from A1
and computer science major, 
as well as a Student Senator.
Another Student Senator 
and sophomore business ad­
ministration major, Toro Ad- 
eyemi, spoke of her surprise 
that the tax was dropped.
“Even though I and student 
government and other indi­
viduals fought so hard so that 
the tuition tax would not take 
place, ultimately I was sur­
prised the tax was dropped,” 
Adeyemi said.
In their efforts to oppose 
the tax, students started web­
sites, submitted petitions, 
made phone calls, attended 
city council hearings, and 
joined with Pittsburgh’s other 
colleges to make their views 
known.
According to the Carnegie 
Mellon Student Senate, there 
were over 1000 petition sig­
natures at Carnegie Mellon 
alone, and over 10,000 sig­
natures at all the Pittsburgh
schools combined. Students 
were a constant presence at 
city council meetings. At the 
public hearing on the tax, the 
Pittsburgh colleges sent over 
40 student speakers, along 
with additional supporters, 
and the room had standing 
room only.
“When I was at the city 
council meeting, none of the 
members wanted to punish 
students or thought this was 
the best option. Actually, they 
thought that it was closer to 
their only option,” said Cor- 
rine Walters, a junior com­
puter science and HCI double 
major. “It just required some 
induced creativity and a bit 
of backlash for the mayor to 
drop it.”
In a Dec. 21 e-mail to the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
announcing the end of the 
proposed tax, Carnegie Mel­
lon President Jared L. Cohon 
expressed his interest in work­
ing with the city to help it ad­
dress the budget void.

Risky investments 
pay off for TepperGoogle leaves the Collaborative Innovation Center, relocates to space in East Liberty
Kristen Severson/Publisher
In 2004, the Graduate School of Industrial Administration was 
renamed the David A. Tepper School of Business.
TEPPER, from Al
“The man knows his own 
worth.”
“[Tepper] can analyze 
a business and he can say 
whether that business will 
actually go bankrupt, or if it 
is only having temporary fi­
nancial problems, but has a 
strong business plan,” busi­
ness master’s student Kan- 
waljit Chugh said.
Given Tepper’s predilec­
tion for seeking out distressed 
companies that need invest­
ment the most, it should 
come as no surprise that he 
is also a big philanthropist. 
In 2004, Tepper donated $55 
million to Carnegie Mellon’s 
Graduate School of Indus­
trial Administration, which 
then officially renamed itself 
as the David A. Tepper School 
of Business. Tepper has also 
made several large gifts to his
alma mater, the University of 
Pittsburgh, including several 
undergraduate scholarships 
and grants.
Despite his wealth, Tepper 
comes from a middle-class 
background and still prefers 
a modest lifestyle. Despite the 
fact that they have over $12 
billion under management, 
Appaloosa has its headquar­
ters in a small three-story of­
fice building in the town of 
Chatham, N.J. Tepper himself 
still lives in Chatham in the 
same two-story home that he 
bought back in 1991.
The Independent aptly de­
scribed him as one “who es­
chews the glitz of Manhattan 
or the gargantuan houses of 
Connecticut in favor of nights 
at home in New Jersey with 
his wife Marlene and their 
three children, and for coach­
ing his kids’ baseball, soccer, 
and softball.”

Every time someone men­
tions the word “Google” on 
campus, ears visibly perk up. 
At a school known for having 
a large population of com­
puter science majors, any 
news concerning the Internet 
goliath presents many possi­
bilities: new gadgets to supply 
any techie’s cravings, jobs for 
recent graduates, or just the 
chance that something poten­
tially decade-defining is about 
to happen.
Yet the news of late is more 
bittersweet than usual. After 
four years of unprecedented 
partnership with Carnegie 
Mellon, Apple, Intel, and oth­
er big names in technology, 
Google is moving out of the 
campus’ Collaborative Innova­
tion Center (CIC) into its own 
building in Pittsburgh.
Beginning in December 
2005, Google and former Car­
negie Mellon computer sci­
ence faculty member Andrew 
Moore have been working to­
gether to initiate a Pittsburgh 
branch of the company. It 
seemed only fitting to estab­
lish offices in the CIC, a space 
built especially for the pur­
pose of bringing together the 
great computer science minds 
at Carnegie Mellon and the 
technology leaders of today.
Despite Google’s depar­
ture from campus property, 
the corperation still wishes to 
advance cooperation with the 
university, its faculty, and its 
students. Just this past Sep­
tember, Google purchased a 
Carnegie Mellon-based com­
pany, reCAPTCHA. reCAPT- 
CHA assigns a new, dual use 
to CAPTCHAs, the distorted- 
letter tests found at the bot­
tom of registration forms on 
many sites including Yahoo, 
Hotmail, PayPal, and Wikipe­
dia. CAPTCHA, an acronym

require users to type the dis­
torted letters they see.
“But there’s a twist — the 
words in many of the CAPT­
CHAs provided by reCAPT­

chival newspapers and old

to recognize these words be­
cause the ink and paper have

typing them in as a CAPT­
CHA, crowds teach computers 
to read the scanned text,” Luis 
von Ahn, co-founder of re­
CAPTCHA, and Will Cathcart, 
Google product manager, stat­
ed in a Google Blog announc­
ing the purchase. reCAPTCHA 
will continue to develop as 
both companies move into the
new Pittsburgh headquarters.
Google is moving to an 
East Liberty location, Bakery 
Square, where they will claim 
a 40,000-square-foot space in 
the building formerly used as 
a Nabisco plant. With the ex­
panded space, Google will be 
able to offer even more jobs 
than before, mostly in the field 
of engineering and software 
development. A recent Post- 
Gazette article reported that 
Google is “aggressively hiring” 
to fill up the extra space and 
that, “about one-half of the of­
fice’s current employees were 
educated at schools in the re­
gion — places like CMU, the 
University of Pittsburgh, Penn 
State University, and Case 
Western Reserve University in 
Cleveland — and Google plans 
to maintain a similar ratio as it 
expands.” With these statistics 
in mind, most students are not 
concerned about losing future 
opportunities. “'Honestly, to
the extent of my knowledge, 
I’m not sure it will make a dif­
ference,” said Andrey Grinsh- 
pun, a junior math and com­
puter science major.
With the start of a new 
year, and a chance for new 
beginnings, Google’s move 
to East Liberty signals a new 
turn for both the university 
and the city of Pittsburgh. In 
a recent letter to the Carnegie 
Mellon community, President 
Jared Cohon called the move 
a “wonderful success story — 
for Google, for Carnegie Mel­
lon, and for Pittsburgh.”
Moving to its own inde­
pendent branch, Google has 
expressed the success of the 
alliance with a university, the 
growing potential of the CIC, 
the rising eminence of Pitts­
burgh as a technology hub, 
and the bright futures in store 
for students and graduates of 
Carnegie Mellon that rely on 
corporate success.

Handheld technology increases sales for GE
ABHAY BUCH
Staffwriter
Graduate students at the 
Heinz College have devel­
oped new methods and tech­
nologies that have allowed a 
division of General Electric 
(GE) to improve its efficiency. 
As a part of their final proj­
ect, graduate students Ashish 
Mehta, Pramod J. Mallapra- 
gada, Joseph Morse, Ven- 
katesh Narayan, and Nitika 
Sharma (all of whom are part 
of the Master of Informa­
tion Systems and Manage­
ment program) developed 
programs and processes that 
allow GE’s truck-leasing divi­
sion to work more efficiently.
The basic premise of their 
project is to simulate indus­
try-standard processes in the 
college environment and to 
get a feel for the way organi­
zations work. This will also 
help them get some experi­
ence before actually going on 
to their jobs in professional 
life.
According to their adviser, 
Christopher Kowalsky, an ad­
junct associate professor in 
the Heinz College, their proj­
ect “followed the best prac­
tices” of process management 
and each person played a part 
similar to one they would 
play after graduation. Kow­
alsky said that they “worked 
as if they were professionals,” 
with concrete goals and regu­
lar evaluations.
The goal of the project 
was to work with the spon­
sors at GE to find a way to 
improve the productivity of 
GE’s truck-leasing division. 
This division has two types
of customers: the first are 
long-term customers who 
draw up contracts for many 
months or years and whose 
plans are known well in ad­
vance. The methods for deal­
ing with such customers are 
well-established. The second 
type of customers includes 
those with “short cycle sales,” 
one-time assignments that 
are often on the spur of the 
moment. The second type of 
customer is harder to pursue 
because the customer’s needs 
have to be dealt with quickly. 
GE noticed that these shorter- 
term customers represented 
an opportunity for the com­
pany to grow.
It was this opportunity 
that the team from Heinz 
analyzed, resulting in the 
creation of a website allow­
ing salespeople to access GE’s 
central databases without 
having to actually be at the 
office. “[GE] needed a better 
tool to help its field-deployed 
sales team connect wirelessly 
back to their branch offices 
and the business Customer 
Care Center,” stated a Heinz 
College website press release. 
A solution was needed “to 
link existing database sys­
tems and deliver data in an 
online application, accessible 
from mobile handheld devic­
es.” GE’s salespeople can now 
complete many of their duties 
by using just their Blackber- 
rys. The team also extended 
GE’s existing infrastructure 
to allow their application to 
work seamlessly. Being able 
to complete all the required _ 
work in the field is essential,

Solar cells: Technology capturing the boundless energy of the sun

Eco-friendly solar cells convert light energy to electrical energy.
ZACHARIAS GEORGE
Staffwriter
Albert Einstein is best re­
membered today for his theory 
of relativity. However, it was 
his explanation of the pho­
toelectric effect that earned 
him a Nobel Prize in physics in 
1921.
The photoelectric effect ex­
plained the behavior of light 
particles in terms of discrete 
quanta, or amounts of energy.
This research greatly accel­
erated the understanding of 
the operation of the solar cell, 
allowing for a number of inno­
vative improvements.
Silicon is the most versa­
tile semiconductor material 
because operating on a silicon 
substrate is both easy and well 
studied. Today, as a result of
this ease of use, silicon has be­
come ubiquitous.
We see it in our integrated 
circuits, microprocessors, and 
also in the solar panels used to 
harvest the sun’s light energy.
All atoms have a dense 
nucleus composed of neutrons 
and protons. This nucleus 
is surrounded by negatively 
charged electrons, which are 
equal in number to the posi­
tively charged protons in the 
nucleus. The atom therefore 
has no net charge.
For most atoms, the out­
ermost orbit of electrons con­
stantly strives to accept or re­
ject electrons so as to contain 
eight electrons (its most stable 
state).
Silicon occupies a special 
place in the periodic table of 
elements, as it has four elec­
trons in the outermost electron 
orbit. This allows every silicon 
atom to form bonds with four 
other silicon atoms by sharing 
electrons.
This sharing of electrons 
forms a bond known as a co­
valent bond. By forming four 
covalent bonds, each silicon 
atom now has eight electrons.
The simplest solar cell can 
be devised from just crystal­
line silicon. When light falls on 
the surface of the crystalline 
silicon, the energetic light par­
ticles — photons — transfer 
their energy to the electrons in 
the covalent bonds of the sili­
con atoms.
Electrons can only leave the 
bond they are shared in if sup­
plied with sufficient energy. 
Only photons that are vibrat­
ing at a “threshold frequency” 
or above possess enough en­
ergy to knock an electron out 
of its covalent bond.
Any photons at frequen­
cies less than the threshold 
frequency pass right through 
the silicon wafer without re­
leasing any electrons. Photons 
with too much energy release 
an electron, and the excess en­
ergy is dissipated in the wafer 
as heat.
Releasing electrons from 
bonds is important because 
free electrons constitute the
flow of electric current.
The electrons that receive 
sufficient energy from inci­
dent photons then break free 
from the covalent bond and 
are forced to move in one di­
rection^ usually toward one 
electrode.
An escaping electron leaves 
in its place a “hole,” which 
simply represents the lack of 
an electron in a bond.
These holes, which are 
atoms missing an electron, 
migrate toward the opposite 
electrode anti-parallel to the 
direction of motion of the elec­
trons.
The movement of electrons 
generates an electric current, 
which ultimately is the basis 
for getting power from solar 
cells.
Solar cells are made of a 
number of layers. These lay­
ers all serve various purposes. 
The layers typically include a 
protective layer, a non-reflec- 
tive layer, contacts, and doped 
silicon or other light-reactive 
material.
Efficiency is defined as the 
ratio of output electric energy 
to the incident light energy.
A silicon wafer alone pro­
duces very little electric ener­
gy, usually on the order of less 
than 5 percent. This efficiency 
can be improved by a number
of methods.
The best option is to intro­
duce certain impurities into 
the silicon crystal. These im­
purities can have their elec­
trons freed relatively easily, 
and are usually trace amounts 
of boron or phosphorous.
Reducing the amount of 
incident light reflected by the 
surface of silicon (crystalline 
silicon is highly reflective) also 
improves the efficiency of the 
cell.
The first solar cell (made 
of selenium instead of silicon) 
had an efficiency of around 1 
percent. As more was learned 
about the chemistry involved, 
better materials began to be 
used. With time, the doped 
silicon cells reached efficien­
cies of around 25 percent, as 
stated on www.PhysOrg.com. 
While this might seem like a 
low efficiency when compared 
with other energy sources, 
this is a considerably high ef­
ficiency among the solar cell 
technologies.
Recently, other elements 
and combinations of elements 
have been used to manufac­
ture cells. These materials 
include complex compounds 
such as gallium arsenide and 
cadmium telluriae.
Today, the highest effi­
ciency achieved is 43 percent,
as reported by www.PhysOrg. 
com.
These cells consist of a 
number of different light- 
capturing layers, allowing 
the cells to capture a broader 
spectrum of incident light. 
This would mean that photons 
having lower frequencies may 
also be used to generate elec- 
tron-hole pairs.
According to Nature, the 
Earth receives as much energy 
in one hour as is required by 
humans for an entire year.
Efforts by nations around 
the world to harness this “free 
energy” are picking up. The 
advantages of this source of 
energy are plenty; for exam­
ple, there is no fuel spent and 
there are no noxious exhaust 
gases to damage the environ­
ment.
With our fast-dwindling 
fossil fuel reserves, it is be­
coming increasingly clear how 
important a renewable source 
of energy is for the survival of 
energy-dependent mankind.
Today, of the many renew­
able energy sources avail­
able, solar energy is the most 
researched, owing largely to 
solar panels. At the rate re­
search is progressing, it seems 
comfortably positioned at the 
top of the stack of renewable 
energy sources.

SciTech Editor
The Internet connects 
people around the world — 
an unparalleled network of 
information about almost 
everything, accessible almost 
everywhere. But can it fabri­
cate a disease?
The Morgellons Research 
Foundation states Morgellons 
is characterized mainly by the 
belief that fibers are emerg­
ing from the skin. Symptoms 
of itching, biting and crawl­
ing sensations also exist, as do 
skin lesions.
There are even more am­
biguous symptoms to de­
scribe the affliction, including 
changes in cognition, memory 
loss, mood disturbance, and 
serious neurological manifes­
tations.
The fibers supposedly pro­
duced from individuals who 
had Morgellons have been 
analyzed by scientists in the 
Tulsa Police Crime Lab, and 
did not match anything in an 
FBI database, meaning more 
research is to be done.
These fibers are of diferent 
colors and appear in bundles. 
After tests were run under the 
direction of lab director Mark 
Boese, it was concluded that 
the fibers could have been a 
byproduct of some organism, 
although it was not stated 
which.
Many people with 
Morgellons claim they feel 
these fibers under their skin: 
some in large patches on their 
back, and others in small plac­
es, like on the toes. A few re­
port pain and disfigurement.
There is one common idea 
stated by patients: these fi­
bers cause enough damage to 
change the lives of the suffer­
ers.
Other causes have been 
proposed to explain the fi­
bers. Some believe they may 
be caused by a certain bacte­
rium or parasite, and others
believe they are created by 
the body in a form of an im­
mune response.
Many researchers have 
proposed their own explana­
tions, but often without suf­
ficient evidence to support 
their claims.
Morgellons is a controver­
sial disease; at least 13,000 
families suffer from it, but the 
actual number is thought to 
be even higher.
However, its origins are as 
uncertain as its classification 
in the medical world.
The name Morgellons can 
be traced back to 2001 to a 
woman named Mary Leitao, 
whose two-year-old son de­
veloped lip sores and noted 
feelings of “bugs.”
After examining the sores, 
she found that they contained 
a number of fibers growing 
from them. However, her 
claims were dubious; many 
doctors did not find anything 
unusual with the sores, even 
as Leitao continued to note 
the emergence of more fibers 
from her son.
Some doctors suggested 
Leitao suffered from a syn­
drome where a parent pre­
tends a child is sick for atten­
tion.
Nevertheless, Leitao con­
tinued to research the disease 
more and eventually formed 
the Morgellons Research 
Foundation.
Using the Internet, indi­
viduals can diagnose their 
own symptoms if they feel 
they have a disease.
Without proper medical 
training, and with the panic 
that may accompany the belief 
of having a disease, it is likely 
that many could have found 
symptoms of Morgellons onT 
line that matched their own.
They would have then con­
cluded they had the disease. 
As more and more people 
searched for their symptoms 
and found Morgellons, it be­
came more widely known.
However, at the rate informa­
tion spreads around the Inter­
net, some believe it is likely 
Morgellons is simply an Inter­
net meme that spread quickly 
but is not entirely true.
The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention
are currently researching 
Morgellons and have not yet 
confirmed if it is a real, infec­
tious disease.
However, most medical 
professionals do not believe 
Morgellons is a real disease, 
and instead note its similarity 
to some psychological disor­
ders.
One Of the most prominent 
theories explains Morgellons 
as being delusional parasito­
sis. This is a psychiatric dis­
order where patients believe 
they are infected with para­
sites and may even feel them 
under their skin, a condition 
known as formication.
Patients may also attempt 
to remove these imaginary 
parasites by picking away at 
their skin, explaining the le­
sions that are found in those 
afflicted with Morgellons.
Some are also known to 
collect the removed parasites 
and fibers from under the skin 
as proof of disease and pres­
ent them to physicians.
Those with Morgellons 
might show their fibers to 
their doctors.
Morgellons is also believed 
to be confused with true skin 
disorders such as different 
forms of dermatitis.
In addition, real parasites, 
like scabies, can cause similar 
symptoms. The scabies para­
site buries under the skin, 
causing itching.
While Morgellons cannot 
yet be discarded as a fabri­
cation, its strongest support 
comes from its victims instead 
of researchers. Morgellons 
must provide true scientific 
evidence before it can be ac­
cepted by the medical com­
munity.
FLU, from A5
“The Optimal Composition of 
Influenza Vaccines Subject to 
Random Production Yields,” 
was published in October 
2009 and concerns provid­
ing a way to determine what 
virus strains would be most 
useful to be combated by a 
proposed vaccine.
Although science is not 
part of Cho’s official role, he 
still has a remarkable grasp 
of how influenza viruses af­
fect people.
Every year, various influ­
enza viruses circulate with 
different levels of severity. In 
2009, the most prominent of 
these virus strains happened 
to be the swine flu. “We can­
not perfectly predict which 
virus strain will spread each 
year,” reported Cho from his 
office in Posner Hall.
He first became interested 
in this research several years 
ago, when only two manufac­
turers provided flu vaccines. 
One of the manufacturers 
was forced to abandon pro­
duction after their vaccines 
were revealed to be contami­
nated, leaving only 50 million 
vaccinations available to the 
general public — not nearly 
enough.
By the end of 2009, de­
mand for the swine flu vac­
cine lessened as the active 
cases of flu had declined 
since the peak of H1N1 cases 
in the fall.
Therefore, the govern­
ment decided to cut back its 
orders from vaccine manu­
facturers — a Yahoo news 
article reported that the U.S. 
would cut its vaccination or­
der from Australia’s CSL Ltd. 
in half— as fear of the swine 
flu decreased.
Each year, the Vaccine and 
Related Biologic Products 
Advisory Committee decides 
by February or March which 
specific virus strains to in­
clude in vaccines.
Essentially, the committee 
has to choose one of three op­
tions: It can delay its decision 
in order to observe the vi­
ruses more thoroughly, it can 
retain the virus strain used 
in the previous year, or it can 
change to a new virus strain.
“If you change to a new 
virus strain,” warns Cho, 
“production becomes more 
unpredictable.”
He points out the flaw in 
the argument as this: If the 
committee chooses to distrib­
ute earlier, the risk of protect­
ing against a wrong strain 
rises.
Of course, even with me­
ticulous planning, there’s no 
telling if the vaccine will be 
useful again in the years to 
come, as the viruses are con­
stantly mutating. The obser­
vation option involves moni­
toring virus activities around 
the world.
This is precisely how Cho 
developed his mathematical 
model.
It included several vari­
ables, including the “cross­
efficacy” of the vaccine in 
question (how effective the 
vacdne will be when a vac­
cine strain differs from a cir­
culating strain), the number 
of manufacturers, how many 
vaccines the manufactur­
ers can produce in a certain 
amount of time, the amount 
of time before distribution, 
and the number of viruses es­
timated to be circulating.
Cho hopes that the model 
will be considered before the 
committee meets again for 
the yearly distribution plan.
The ultimate goal of his 
work — to better match sup­
ply and demand through an 
“optimal dynamic policy” — 
may lead to a better use of 
limited resources, and, more 
importantly, limited time in 
the face of global health cri­
ses.
SALES, from A5
as many of GE’s custom­
ers are far away from their 
offices, and this application 
allowed the salespeople to 
spend more time selling 
and less time in the office. 
It also helps the salespeople 
work toward realizing GE’s 
ambitious goals of contact­
ing five times as many cus­
tomers and doubling their 
customer base. The Heinz 
team also came up with 
processes that allow the 
necessary data entry to be 
done quickly and painlessly 
by reducing the number of 
pieces of data that salespeo­
ple need to input.
As a project, this took 
up a significant amount of 
the students’ time. “The 
team spent, individually, 
about 23 or 24 hours per 
person per week over the 14 
weeks,” Kowalsky said.
The team also worked 
with GE personnel to en­
sure that it met its goals 
and provided the results GE 
wanted. GE had a transition 
of the technology at the end 
of the term and is now em­
ploying it productively and 
also continuing to develop, 
and extend the results of 
the project.
It is interesting to note 
that this is just one of many 
projects that the Heinz 
College has under devel­
opment. Previous projects 
have been carried out while 
working with companies 
like Ernst & Young, Bearing 
Point, and UPMC.
Giving students insight 
into the inner workings of 
companies provides tangi­
ble benefits. “This has been 
a big win, and a competitive 
advantage for our commer­
cial team — very helpful 
during a tough economic 
time in our industry,” said 
Brent Russell of GE, as quot­
ed on the Heinz website.

Scandals tarnish athletes’ images
Tiger Woods.
That name, which up until a few 
months ago may have brought to 
mind images of a well-mannered pro 
golf player, now brings up an entire­
ly different set of images. With news 
reports of Woods’ 17 mistresses and 
counting, along with information 
about racy texts and voice mails, it 
seems that golfs reputation as the 
gentleman’s sport will never be the 
same.
Along with Woods’ scandal about 
his string of affairs, the less-sur­
prising news concerning Mark Mc­
Gwire’s steroid use became public. 
With all the not-so-flattering sports- 
related news that’s coming out late­
ly, the question that comes to mind 
is: What is going on with all of our 
sports stars?
Sports were once about integ­
rity, hard work, training, and always 
playing one’s best. In recent years, 
however, admissions of steroid use, 
corked bats, and other attempts to 
cut corners and achieve success the 
easy way have been skyrocketing. 
And while athletes used to be good 
role models, their positive images 
have been fading quickly.
Tiger Woods is, essentially, the 
face of the game of golf — the name 
that even non-golf enthusiasts know. 
He was the most well-known gentle­
man of the gentleman’s game. But
no one wants to say that they look 
up to a man whose affairs total in the 
double digits. And the monumental 
battle in 1998 between Sammy Sosa 
and McGwire seems much less in­
spiring after realizing that McGwire 
was using drugs to help enhance his 
performance.
Like celebrities, sports stars know 
that they are constantly in the public 
eye. Unless they want to be relegat­
ed to the status of socialites and re­
ality stars, who are well-known but 
not usually well-liked, their actions 
need to undergo a major reform. 
These stars have a responsibility 
to have their private actions corre­
spond to their public image.
Companies should follow Google’s lead
After giving in to China’s demands 
for four years, Google has finally tak­
en an extreme step — it has decided 
to stop censoring its search results in 
China.
Tired of the country’s required 
censorship of the Internet, Google 
has decided that it may be best to 
close its operations in China. The de­
cision was made after the company 
suspected the Chinese government of 
hacking into the Gmail user accounts 
of Chinese human rights activists.
According to a New York Times 
article, Google has said that it will 
try to negotiate with the Chinese au­
thorities regarding censorship and 
surveillance issues before taking the 
drastic step of shutting down google, 
cn. However, considering the repu­
tation of the Chinese government, a
successful negotiation seems highly 
unlikely.
As journalists, we at The Tartan 
certainly promote freedom of speech 
and commend Google’s efforts to do 
the same. With sites such as YouTube 
frequently blocked and search en­
gines heavily censored, China had 
already severely restricted the free­
dom of its citizens, but by infiltrating 
private user accounts, the Chinese 
government went too far.
Even with such a serious attack 
on users’ security, Google’s decision 
is unexpected after years of compla­
cency. «
A company should adapt its poli­
cies to the laws of the country where 
it is situated, but not to the extent 
of giving up its core values. Google 
is a trusted name in the world, and
by standing up to China’s excessive 
censorship of information, Google 
has established that it will not un­
dermine that trust by compromising 
its values.
The Chinese government, as ex­
pected, is censoring news of its dis­
pute with Google. It is ironic that 
while the entire world knows of 
Google’s decision, many Chinese 
remain oblivious. Without Google, 
China will truly be cut off from the 
rest of the world. While it is too much 
to hope for a complete reform in the 
attitude of the Chinese government, 
we can at least hope that other com­
panies will follow Google and not 
give up their values. We applaud 
Google’s stand against censorship 
and hope China eases its restrictions 
on its people.
Student Affairs needs permanent leader
Our still newly selected dean of 
student affairs, Karen Boyd, has re­
signed.
After her selection in an in­
volved search that seemed to persist 
throughout all of last spring, her 
departure just six months later is 
shocking, saddening, and infuriating 
to the university community.
We could focus on asking harder 
questions, expecting more answers
— better answers — from the admin­
istration on why we are again with­
out a dean of student affairs, but we 
know that no answer is going to be 
acceptable. Her decision was made 
and accepted by our administration, 
with Michael Murphy now serving 
as interim dean for the remainder of 
the year.
What we ask is: What plan exists
to find strong, consistent leadership 
for the Division of Student Affairs?
Over the past two years, we have 
had four deans, whether perma­
nent or interim. It now seems likely 
that a fifth will start this fall. When 
that happens, he or she will have a 
whirlwind of predecessors to clean 
up after, each with a unique vision, 
different goals, and varied projects 
and promises that may have been 
abandoned, forgotten, overwritten, 
or ignored.
We do not mean to downplay the 
effort that Dick Tucker, Boyd, and Mi­
chael Murphy have put and. continue 
to put into their work; however, the 
Division of Student Affairs seems to 
have become a revolving door of ad­
ministrative entrances and exits over 
the past two years.
We have to question the long-term 
effects that the numerous changes in 
leadership will have. For example, 
the current class of juniors will not 
have had a dean of student affairs 
who lasted longer than a year during 
its entire tenure at Carnegie Mellon. 
What have these students lost?
The dean of student affairs must 
be a champion for the students, an 
innovator, a listener, a trusted source 
in the administration to be sure the 
student voice is heard.
There is a vacancy at the heart of 
this campus. So for now, this spring, 
we are again left to search for a dean 
of students who will be a true match 
for Carnegie Mellon, a dean who will 
start next fall with a new class of stu­
dents and might just be present to 
see them graduate.
Goal of security should 
not destroy privacy
/?UJc
Terrorists will strike again.
They will slip through our intel­
ligence networks, walk through the 
gauntlet of full-body scanners and 
puffer machines and metal detector 
wands and bomb-sniffing dogs, take 
a seat in row 16, and kill more inno­
cent people.
Or maybe they will find lost nu­
clear material from Pakistan or the 
former Soviet Union, make a bomb 
with the help of Iranian or American 
scientists and engineers, take a yacht 
into Boston Harbor, and attack.
Or maybe they will buy a stolen 
assault rifle in an American city and 
walk into an elementary school.
The reality is that we cannot stop 
every attack any more than we can 
kill every terrorist. The more surveil­
lance we add, the less freedom we 
retain. No security camera or wire­
tapping technology can be perfect, 
but it can be abused. When full-body 
scanners exist not just in every air­
port, but also in sports stadiums and 
high schools, we will not have “de­
feated terrorism,” but we will have 
lost that which we aim to protect.
This Orwellian scenario seems a 
bit extreme, but it is not so unlikely 
as it appears. Because our notion of 
defense against terrorism consists of 
looking at what terrorists attack and 
then stopping them from doing it 
again, so far we have focused almost 
exclusively on airport security. The 
theory seems to be that if we make 
flying inconvenient enough for ter­
rorists, they will give up. This is 
true for the average American trav­
eler, who views walking through a 
modern-day airport with the ?ame 
excitement as going to the dentist, 
but a sufficiently determined terror­
ist will still find a way around new 
security measures. Humans have 
invented too many ways to destroy 
each other; we can never be com­
pletely secure.
I am not arguing that we remove 
security checkpoints from airports 
and allow handguns on flights. Rea­
sonable security is both effective 
and necessary to stop malicious in­
dividuals and discourage terrorist 
organizations.
However, full-body scanners are 
one of those “magic” surveillance 
technologies for which the costs 
outweigh the benefits. If they be­
come widely used in airports, they 
are a step, albeit an expensive one, 
away from other locations. If there is 
a bombing at the Super Bowl or the 
Olympics or a school, experts will 
always argue that the incident could
have been detected.
Technologies like full-body scan­
ners are worrisome for a number of 
reasons. The most discussed of these 
is privacy. Many Americans do not 
like the idea of nameless TSA offi­
cers seeing under their clothes. This 
seems to me like the least-concern­
ing effect of the scanners. At least 
judging by sample images posted 
online, the results of the scan will 
hardly be identifiable. The majority 
of Americans seem to share this lack 
of concern, as 78 percent of respon­
dents in a USA Today poll supported 
full-body scanners.
The more concerning conse­
quence of advanced surveillance de­
vices is that once sophisticated scan­
ners begin to be used in airports, they 
will start becoming accepted by the 
public. We would not be outraged to 
have to walk through a metal detec­
tor at the Super Bowl. In time, with 
more attacks and threats of attacks, 
this could easily be extended to full- 
body scanners.
The difference between metal 
detectors, which are not uncommon 
in public venues, and full-body scan­
ners, which are still controversial, is 
the type of data they produce. Metal 
detectors give a basic result: Either 
something metallic is detected or it 
is not. On the other hand, a detailed 
scan gives information that would 
be extremely valuable to intelligence 
officers, not to mention advertisers. 
A full-body scan matched with an 
identity would be more useful than 
a passport photo or fingerprint. If a 
government can listen in on its citi- * 
zens’ conversations without their 
knowledge, it should not be trusted 
to resist the temptation of linking 
their images with other data.
Successfully maintaining secu­
rity and preventing terrorist attacks 
is often a matter of gathering and 
analyzing information. In govern­
ment reports, including the one on 
the Christmas Day attack, there is a 
tendency to assign blame to one of 
these two categories — in the most 
recent'case, it was analysis and “con­
necting the dots.”
However obvious a successful 
terrorist plot may seem in retro­
spect, the reality is that it still hap­
pened, and it will happen again. We 
should not expect to be perfect, nor 
should we make quick and reckless 
choices when our perfection fails. 
We should look at terrorism and 
security in a larger context, one in 
which the benefits of freedom and 
privacy often outweigh the costs of 
absolute security.

Burj Khalifa’s size does not reflect economic power
Earlier this month, the tallest 
building in the world opened in 
Dubai to a sparkling ceremony of 
pomp and circumstance in the Middle 
Eastern emirate — and to skepticism 
from the rest of the world. The Jan. 4 
opening was no small affair: The Burj 
Khalifa was opened to 6000 guests 
and framed by 10,000 fireworks (but 
presumably no cocktails). But behind 
this pomp and circumstance was 
little more than a desperate plea to 
keep Dubai thriving.
The Burj Khalifa, formerly termed 
the Burj Dubai or the Dubai tower, 
was recently renamed in honor of 
Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, 
the president of the United Arab 
Emirates and emir of Abu Dhabi, 
one of the seven emirates. This name 
change follows a $10 billion bailout 
by Abu Dhabi on the part of Dubai 
in December, when it became clear 
to the country — and to the world
— that even this supposedly boom­
ing center of real estate growth was 
not immune to the global economic 
downturn.
Safely surpassing the former tall­
est building in the world, the finan­
cial center called the Taipei 101 in 
Taiwan, the Burj Khalifa stands 2717

“I’m sorry. We could have stopped 
catastrophic climate change... we 
didn’t.” —Future President Obama.
A digitally aged future President 
Obama was joined by several future 
leaders, including German Chan­
cellor Angela Merkel, British Prime 
Minister Gordon Brown, and oth­
ers, in a series of Greenpeace ads to 
coincide with COP15, or the more 
properly named 2009 United Nations 
Climate Change Conference. In the 
ads, our current leaders apologize 
for failing to take action to stop the 
then-“catastrophic” climate change. 
Greenpeace has become more and 
more bold and extremist in its adver­
tising; if we can still remember the 
spectacle that was the G-20 here in 
Pittsburgh, we might also recall the
In light of recent global events 
such as the earthquake and subse­
quent crisis in Haiti, people should 
be able to depend on news and media 
for consistent updates and first-hand 
accounts of what is truly going on. 
However, while many popular cul­
ture-centric citizens may still be con­
cerned with what color see-through 
tank top Miley Cyrus wore out to 
dinner with her boyfriend last night, 
there are those of us that would pre­
fer to see that genre of celebrity com­
mentary take a back seat. This week, 
the seemingly constant media cover­
age of NBC’s late-night debacle has 
proven to follow a similar pattern,
feet tall, features views of up to 60 
miles away (of the desert, sure), and 
cost $1.5 billion to build. When the 
construction of the soaring structure 
began in 2004, parcels were quickly 
sold to groups from all around the 
Middle East, Eastern Asia, and the 
United States — although many of 
those are still for sale.
They say that if you build it, they 
will come. But with this global eco­
nomic climate, in which citizens 
around the world are seemingly 
making a permanent change in their 
spending and travel habits, bragging 
rights about having the tallest build­
ing in the world might not travel far.
And nor should it: The Burj Khal­
ifa is simply a symbol of being a sym­
bol, much like Dubai itself.
That is, the building is no more 
than a symbol of “merely the Emir­
ates’ once-deep pockets,” as Witold 
Rybczynski wrote in a Jan. 13 ar­
ticle on www.slate.com titled “Dubai 
Debt: What the Burj Kahlifa — the 
tallest building in the world — owes 
to Frank Lloyd Wright.”
There is an increasingly persis­
tent argument in the media that says 
that even as the recession recedes, 
consumers’ spending habits may be 
permanently altered. There are pre­
dictions that we really have become 
less wasteful, less inclined to throw 
down large sums on money on fleet-
Greenpeace activists that dangled 
along with a climate change banner 
off our own West End Bridge, so these 
ads should come as no surprise.
Of course, we should assume 
Greenpeace is simply being fanati­
cal, and that these apologetic ads 
are already outdated due to the far- 
reaching, environment-protecting, 
carbon-footprint-lowering resolu­
tions agreed to in the harmonious 
COP15 meetings.
Except, oh wait, the conference 
was a failure. It didn’t work. No agree­
ment was reached. No reductions in 
carbon emissions were agreed to. No 
successor to the Kyoto Protocol was 
created, signed, or ratified. The meet­
ing went precisely as the Greenpeace 
ads suggested that a world looking 
back in 2020 would perceive.
On Dec. 7, the day the conference 
began, an exceptional declaration 
was sounded by 56 newspapers, each 
publishing the same editorial. Yes, in
and I am not amused.
Although I cannot fairly refer to 
myself as an avid late-night talk show 
fan, I have been forced to follow 
the NBC chaos through consistent 
broadcast updates on multiple news 
networks. For example, while many 
publications have chosen to print sto­
ries on the subject, CNN’s constant 
text-message updates to my iPhone 
are the most annoying.
The story is as follows: Last week, 
NBC announced that it would be 
canceling Jay Leno’s prime-time 
show and returning the comedian 
to his previous late-night block. This 
new lineup would move host Conan 
O’Brien and his program, “The To­
night Show with Conan O’Brien,” 
back to a 12:05 a.m. slot, appro­
priately and amusingly earning it a
ing, flashy goods. This is a good thing
— but certainly not for Dubai.
Dubai has branded itself as a 
better — read: hotter — Las Vegas. 
But while Las Vegas has somewhat 
bounced back from the worst part 
of the beginning of the recession, it’s 
done so largely because of its resi­
dents. There is no income tax in the 
city, and residents are largely work­
ing in service industries — but they 
are indeed employed, and are usually 
American citizens.
In Dubai, a huge proportion of the 
population of the emirate is that of 
migrant workers. Stories of the hor­
rendous conditions in which these 
largely South Asian migrant workers 
live and work — and were injured 
and killed during the construction of 
the Burj Khalifa — certainly dampen 
the image of the supposedly luxuri­
ous urban center.
Moreover, the cultural and social 
differences between Dubai and Las 
Vegas mean the former cannot nec­
essarily mimic the success of the lat­
ter — nor should it. The disregard for 
environmental sustainability — or 
for the physical environment at all — 
is one element that the two regions 
have in common. However, that is 
nothing to be proud of.
Las Vegas still exists as the by­
product of an earlier age in which en­
vironmental degradation flew under
a journalistic world where one’s opin­
ion is meant to distinguish your col­
umnist, your editor, your paper from 
its competitors, newspapers across 
45 countries together spoke with a 
singular voice. A voice that called for 
action, for steps to limit emissions, 
and for political bickering to be put 
aside. An editorial that was factual, 
terse, and, more importantly, a call 
to focus not on nationalistic pride, 
but on the future of humanity. There 
was still a hope that these politicians 
could come together, not to vie for 
their own country’s interests, but to 
act as representatives of the planet as 
a whole.
But we know this didn’t happen, 
and the aftermath is more telling 
than the meetings, as each coun­
try seems to have found another to 
blame. Did Denmark fail in its role 
as host, running secret, more exclu­
sive meetings? Did the United States 
refuse to accept that as the largest
new nickname, “The Next Morning 
Show.” The changes, which seem 
to honor Leno completely at the ex­
pense of O’Brien, have caused the 
eruption of a bit of a skirmish.
Even more recently, TV person­
alities like David Letterman, Jimmy 
Fallon, and Jimmy Kimmel have cho­
sen to get involved in the debacle. 
On Thursday night, Kimmel joined 
Leno on his show to discuss the NBC 
affair. Kimmel, on a live video cast, 
ripped Leno apart, openly vying for 
Conan with comments like, “Listen, 
Jay, Conan and I have children -— 
all you have to take care of is cars.” 
Meanwhile, O’Brien announced that 
he would be choosing not to take the 
12:05 a.m. time slot on NBC, and in­
stead would be looking to possibly 
work with other networks.
the radar — no longer is this disre­
gard acceptable in burgeoning urban 
environments.
Additionally, will a rocket ship­
shaped building designed by a Chi­
cago-based architectural firm, and 
with what some call strong inspira­
tions from the skyscraper work of 
the American architect Frank Lloyd 
Wright, strengthen the culture of the 
Middle Eastern city?
To have staying power, a city or 
region must have some cultural ele­
ment that is all its own that makes it 
shine. Simply being a conglomera­
tion of Western and worldwide con­
sumption habits — reflecting what 
has been done elsewhere already, 
and emerging first as an airport stop­
over point — might not be enough to 
make Dubai last.
As Nick Maclean of the real estate 
firm CB Richard Ellis in Dubai told 
The New York Times, the Burj Khalifa 
“is a unique building and symboli­
cally important but it is not going to 
stimulate demand.”
The tallest doesn’t necessarily sig­
nal an epicenter of cultural, econom­
ic, or political power anymore. It just 
signals the most likely to fall.

carbon-emitter it needed to make the 
deepest cuts? Did China’s approach 
to negotiation destroy any hope for 
an open deliberation? Or, most obvi­
ously, did every government leader 
fail, as no agreement was reached?
The cautiously hopeful, tellingly 
worried voice of newspapers across 
the globe may not now clear their 
collective throat and applaud the 
leaders who met in Copenhagen for 
their progress, but must retreat into 
the corner, ashamed. The collective 
editorial must now wait until the end 
of this year, when the leaders come 
back together, for COP16 in Mexico, 
where they can hopefully put to pa­
per words that can unite all of the 
countries present. They must create 
an agreement that will save a gray­
ing Obama from ever being forced to 
apologize to a decimated world.

While the back-and-forth aspect 
of this story certainly is entertaining, 
its constant coverage in the media 
has only revitalized my disdain for 
the relationship between the global 
newscast and the American enter­
tainment business. This is not to sug­
gest that in the face of a crisis people 
should drop everything to immerse 
themselves in the pain and sorrow of 
catastrophe, but rather that the insti­
tutions of American broadcast should 
get their priorities in order. While it is 
certainly acceptable to report on the 
toils of the entertainment business, I 
just hope that stories of true global 
consequence are given precedence.

ADAM KLEIN
As your student body presi­
dent and vice president, Timi and
I would like to welcome everyone 
back to another exciting semester 
at Carnegie Mellon. As you contin­
ue your studies here, we hope you 
realize that your student govern­
ment representatives will continue 
to fight hard for you and provide 
programs and initiatives, such as 
the Tartan Rewards Program, that 
greatly improve the Carnegie Mel­
lon experience and encourage all 
students to explore all that the uni­
versity has to offer.
Last week the student govern­
ment Executive Branch teamed 
up with the Greek community to 
hold the first semiannual Textbook 
Flea Market, which gave students 
the chance to sell their books at 
prices they designated. A great 
success, the Textbook Flea Market 
is an initiative that Timi and I ex­
pect to continue at the end of the 
spring semester, and we hope that 
it will continue in the future under 
new leadership. With revenue of 
over $7000, the aim of this initia­
tive was for students to help them­
selves, help other students, and 
most of all give to charity.
In that vein, the university com­
munity has come together to help 
Haitians in need as a result of the 
recent earthquake. In this trying 
time, Carnegie Mellon’s Division 
of Student Affairs, student govern­
ment, and student organizations 
across campus are calling for a uni­
fied effort from the community to 
support the people of Haiti.
We have kicked off a “Helping 
Haiti Dollar Campaign” to raise 
money for much-needed relief ef­
forts. The Dollar Campaign’s goal 
is to collect at least one dollar from 
every student, staff, and faculty 
member at the university, which 
potentially could yield more than 
$16,000.
All the contributions to the 
“Helping Haiti Dollar Campaign” 
will go to the following organiza­
tions:
Hopital Albert Schweitzer
Doctors without Borders
Brother’s Brother Foundation
YELE
We appreciate and embrace 
your generosity in our efforts to 
support the people of Haiti. Col­
lege students can often get stuck 
in their own bubbles, and raising 
awareness for this heart-wrenching 
event is a moral obligation of this 
campus’s student leaders. As Presi­
dent Obama has said, “It’s in times 
like these that we must show the 
kind of compassion and humanity 
that has defined the best of our na­
tional character for generations.” I 
can assure you that our combined 
efforts will go a long way.

Men’s basketball is 0-3 in UAAs Women’s tennis has high goals
Jessica Sochol/Photo Staff
The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team takes a break during practice. Despite several close games, the 
Tartans stand at 4-9 for the season and 0-3 in UAA competition.
MEN'S, from A12
ble-double of the season with
10 points and 11 rebounds, 
while Anderson once again 
led the team with 16 points. 
The Tartans were just 39 per­
cent from the field compared 
to the Crusaders’ 49 percent. 
Despite the two losses, An­
derson’s performance earned 
him University Athletic Asso­
ciation (UAA) Athlete of the 
Week honors.
On Jan. 8, the Tartans 
opened up UAA play in At­
lanta, Ga., at the home of the 
Emory University Eagles, but 
fell 80-67 in a disappointing 
battle.
“We had a pretty rocky 
start to the season and so we 
really wanted to come out 
strong in UAA play,” sopho­
more Max Gordon said. “It 
was really disappointing to
come away with a loss in our 
UAA opener.”
Just two days later the 
Tartans dropped their second 
UAA game to the Yellowjack- 
ets of Rochester University. 
After an early 14-2 run by 
the Yellowjackets, the Tartans 
could not find a way to win. A 
three-point play by Anderson 
brought the Tartans to within 
one point, but the Yellowjack­
ets went on a 10-0 run and 
maintained control for the 
rest of the game.
Jan. 12 was a bittersweet 
day for the Tartans as they tal­
lied their fifth straight loss in 
a game against Catholic Uni­
versity of America. However, 
in the loss, Anderson became 
the 18th player in Carnegie 
Mellon history to score 1000 
career points. The game was 
close, but the Tartans were 
unable finish on top.
“It’s really tough on the 
team morale to lose five games 
in a row, but it’s still early in 
the season,” Gordon said. “We 
have a big game against Case 
Western coming up and it 
will be a great opportunity to 
show our character and turn 
this season around.”
Unfortunately, the Tartans 
were unable to come away 
with a victory at Case Western 
Reserve University and fell 
to the Spartans 74-70. The 
Tartans fought for the win, as 
first-year Christian Shepley 
sank two three-pointers to 
come within two points with 
only 3:30 remaining in the 
game, but it was not enough 
and the Spartans held onto 
their lead.
The Tartans will resume 
UAA play as they face the Uni­
versity of Chicago in Skibo 
Gym on Friday at 8 p.m.
Track and field competes well 
in first meet of the year at Kent
JONAS ALTMAN-KUROSAKI
Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s and women’s track and 
field teams took on opponents 
from all divisions this past 
Saturday in their first meet of 
the 2010 season. The teams 
competed at Division I Kent 
State University’s Doug Ray­
mond Invite, some continu­
ing on from cross country, 
others shaking off nearly nine 
months of rust since the end 
of the 2009 season. Top run­
ners for the women included 
juniors Laura McKee and 
Courtney Baker, while juniors 
Nate Bussiere and J.R Allera 
ran well for the men. Se­
niors James Hulley and Chris 
Bridgman held their own in 
the field events.
In the women’s 400-meter 
dash, senior Diane Mattingly 
took 20th place with a time 
of 1:02.16. Sophomore Luci 
Laffitte competed two heats 
later and finished in 1:04.39 
to take 24th overall. McKee 
then led the way for Tartans 
in the 800-meter run, com­
pleting the race in 2:28.41 to 
finish seventh in the event, 
5.92 seconds ahead of senior
teammate Crystal LeePow, 
who came in 16th. In the one- 
mile run, it was Baker taking 
charge for Carnegie Mellon, 
clocking in at 5:17.58 and fin­
ishing fifth overall. First-year 
cross country standout Emily 
Wobb took 12th with a time of 
5:34.73.
For the men, first-year Joel 
Lu and sophomore Ryan Kissel 
finished 34th and 35th in the 
60-meter dash with times of 
7.68 and 7.75 seconds, respec­
tively. The duo also competed 
in the 200-meter dash.
Bussiere put forth a strong 
showing in both the 800- 
and 1000-meter runs, tak­
ing eighth place in the 800 
(1:59.86) and sixth in the 
1000 (2:34.95). Sophomore 
Rob Morhard also, competed 
the 800, finishing 15th in 
2:04.63.
Morhard was the team’s 
top finisher in the mile run, 
finishing 18th in 4:33.55, five 
seconds ahead of junior team­
mate Justin Kurp (22nd). 
Allera was the lone Tartan to 
compete in the 3000-meter 
run, completing the event in 
9:03.23, good for 11th place 
overall.
“The meet was early in the
season, but it was a good way 
to gauge where we are and 
where we need more work,” 
said Bussiere. “I was pleased 
with how I ran, especially so 
early in the year. It’s always 
hard to get going after win­
ter break, but this was a good 
opportunity to jump-start the 
season.”
In the field events, junior 
Pat O’Brien tied for 10th in 
the high jump with a height of
1.90 meters. Bridgman began 
his final season by finishing 
fourth in the pole vault, clear­
ing a height of 4.30 meters, 
while Kissel took 13th in the 
long jump with a 5.96-meter 
leap. Hulley, hoping to make 
a mark at NCAAs this year, 
started off his senior season by 
taking eighth in the shot put 
and 13th in the weight throw, 
with distances of 15.71 me­
ters and 15.92 meters, respec­
tively. Senior Chris Fornataro 
also competed in both throw­
ing events, coming in 27th in 
the shot put (12.30 meters) 
and 18th in the weight throw 
(14.23 meters).
Both the men’s and wom­
en’s teams will next compete 
Saturday at Denison Univer­
sity in Granville, Ohio.
‘Heroes’ help families in need
LAUREN HIRATA
Staffwriter
The women’s basketball 
team is calling this upcoming 
weekend “Heroes Weekend” 
in honor of the nonprofit or­
ganization they have been 
working with this season, the 
Hero Program.
The Hero Program sup­
ports financially constricted 
families facing terminal ill­
nesses by helping raise funds, 
medical supply donations, and 
monetary gifts like prepaid 
gas cards. After meeting Steve 
Wetzel, a program head, at 
an athletic department-wide 
event, junior point guard Alex
Hansen explained that the 
team “was particularly moved 
by his story and the types of 
things he was doing.” Hansen 
and sophomore forward Jen 
Larsen then had the opportu­
nity to spend time with Wet­
zel and a Hero family, which 
“made [them] realize the im­
pact [they could] have on lo­
cal people in need.”
For Heroes Weekend, the 
Tartans’ main event will be 
“Hotcakes for Heroes” on Sat­
urday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
in Rangos 3. All-you-can-eat 
pancakes will be served for 
$5 a person. Also, T-shirts and 
Heroes wristbands will be 
sold during the event and at
both the men’s and women’s 
games on Friday and Sunday. 
All of the proceeds will be giv­
en to the Hero Program.
The Tartans want to host 
a successful event, one where 
they, as stated by Hansen, 
“can raise awareness about 
something in our commu­
nity that [Carnegie Mellon 
students] can support and 
change. There will be Hero 
families at the breakfast, so 
everyone who comes can ac­
tually see where their money 
is going.”

After coming off a strong 
fall season, the Carnegie 
Mellon women’s tennis team 
looks to continue its success in 
an always-challenging spring 
season. The Tartans are cur­
rently ranked number six in 
the country, coming off an 
undefeated fall that featured 
a variety of accolades.
Last year, the team finished 
the season with a 21-3 record, 
earned its first showing in the 
history of Carnegie Mellon at 
the NCAA Championships, 
and took second at the UAA 
championships after falling 
4-5 to Emory in the finals.
Opposing teams will have 
nightmares about the Tartans’ 
deep lineup, starting with 
sophomore phenomenon 
Laura Chen. Chen, who starts
mmJÆMMÉBL
at number-one singles, is com­
ing off her second consecutive 
ITA regional championship 
in both singles and doubles. 
Sophomore Courtney Chin 
also had a strong fall season, 
placing second behind Chen 
in the ITA regional tourna­
ment and finishing number 
four in the regional rankings. 
First-year Alex Tapak, who is 
ranked number 13 in the re­
gion, completes an intimidat­
ing top three of a team that 
stands to be one of the best in 
Carnegie Mellon’s history.
The Tartans have circled 
the dates of Feb. 26-28 as one 
of the most crucial periods of 
their season. This marks the 
start of ITA Indoor Nationals, 
where the Tartans are defend­
ing champions and where 
they have always experienced 
a good deal of success. It also 
could be an important match
to start out the team on the 
right foot, and it would give 
them a great deal of confi­
dence throughout the season. 
The Tartans have made win­
ning this tournament one of 
their main goals.
“We have been looking 
forward to this tournament 
ever since we came back from 
school,” Chen said. “If we de­
fend our title, it would be a 
defining moment early in the 
season that should be able to 
set the tone for the rest of the 
year.”
Carnegie Mellon begins 
the quest for the number-one 
ranking on Saturday, Feb. 13, 
against Slippery Rock Univer­
sity and Penn State Behrend 
at the Oxford North Athletic 
Club.

Tiger’s infamy is only temporary
JEREMY KING
Staffwriter
Prior to a couple of months 
ago, professional golfer Tiger 
Woods was recognized as the 
best golfer in the world, and 
possibly the best golfer of all 
time. Then, in the early morn­
ing of Nov. 27, 2009, Woods 
was involved in a minor car ac­
cident, but the details of what 
caused the accident were not 
released. A few weeks later, it 
was discovered that the acci­
dent took place while Woods 
was fleeing from his wife, Elin 
Nordegren, after she discov­
ered that Woods had been 
cheating on her with several 
mistresses. From then on, the 
media exploded, turning an 
already intriguing story into a 
full-blown investigation. De­
spite the bad press, the public 
shouldn’t throw their favor 
for Woods out the window 
just yet.
Woods has been treated 
unfairly and has been exposed 
to too much media criticism. 
However, if Woods plays his 
cards right, he will be able to 
put this troubling time behind 
him. Channels ranging from 
ESPN to CBS reported on the 
“scandal,” with many people 
attacking Woods for his infi­
delity.
Overall, the Woods story 
has been blown way out of 
proportion, and the public is 
not taking into account that 
Woods is a human being, just 
like everyone else.
As a human, he will obvi­
ously make some mistakes in 
his life. Although what he did 
was wrong, there is no rea­
son for us to judge his every
move. Woods’ status as a role 
model should be determined 
based on the way he handles 
this situation, not because of 
the mistakes he has made. If 
Woods continues to handle 
himself in a professional man­
ner, and proves that he has 
turned his life around from a 
major setback, this could in 
fact increase his status as a 
respected role model. He will 
always have this as a red mark 
on his mostly perfect record, 
but he can easily bounce back 
in a huge way.
We must also remember 
that Woods is still the best 
golfer in the world today. No 
matter what he does off the 
course, he still brings excite­
ment to the golf world un­
like any other to ever play the 
game of golf. Golf fans should 
separate his play from his off- 
course antics, and view him 
as someone that has worked 
so hard to achieve many of his 
current accomplishments.
Woods could not have got­
ten this far without hard work 
throughout his life, and any 
other current golfer cannot 
rival his level of dedication to 
the sport. He has fully earned 
his title as “Sportsman of the 
Decade,” as presented to him 
by the Associated Press. Tiger 
has 71 career PGA Tour titles 
and has also won 14 major 
tournaments. This situation 
should not undermine his ac­
complishments, and I fully 
expect Woods to someday be 
elected into the Hall of Fame.
Another debate has been 
about Woods’ future ability 
to bounce back from such a 
devastating blow to his repu­
tation. Major companies such
as Gatorade, AT&T, and Gen­
eral Motors have all dropped 
Woods as a sponsor. Some 
companies, such as Nike, have 
stuck with Woods but less­
ened the amount of publicity 
he gets within the company. I 
believe that if Woods follows a 
few simple steps, he can come 
back to golf facing a much bet­
ter reaction than many people 
are expecting.
First off, Tiger must seek 
help from other superstars 
that have been in similar situ­
ations. The first name that 
comes to mind is none other 
than NBA hero Kobe Bry­
ant. Bryant went through the 
exact same situation almost 
seven years ago. However, 
Bryant has easily salvaged 
his reputation by making 
well-timed apologies along 
with continuing to give all 
his effort on the court. He is 
actually coming off an NBA 
championship from last year. 
Along with great success on 
the court, Bryant has healed 
his image by staying out of 
anything controversial for the 
past seven years. As long as 
Woods stays clean and con­
tinues to have success on the 
course, he will be able to re­
pair his image.
The road out of infamy 
will be extremely tough for 
Woods, but not impossible 
by any means. As long as he 
makes all the right moves, 
and fixes up his personal life, 
he will come back strong. By 
the end of his career, Woods 
will be remembered as the 
greatest golfer to ever play the 
game, and this incident will 
merely be a speed bump in an 
otherwise stellar career.

have been our most intense 
weeks of training, and even 
, though a lot of the guys are 
vfeeling tired and sore, we 
have been able to perform at 
higher levels than I have seen 
in my four years here,” Dahlen 
noted of his team’s spectacular 
success this month. “I think 
our success throughout the 
season has been attributed 
to our depth as a team. We 
are fortunate to have studs 
in every event. Our freshman 
class in particular has done
an outstanding job of filling 
in the voids and has really ex­
panded our depth as a whole. 
Our coach always jokes that it 
makes his life difficult to put 
together relays because we 
have so many talented guys.” 
The Tartans continued 
their momentum against Al­
legheny College, winning 
187-105 on the men’s side 
and 162-124 for the women’s. 
Both teams kicked off the meet 
by taking first in the 200-yard 
medley relay. In the 1000-yard 
freestyle, Adams and senior 
Jon Spring took the victories,
followed by a win from Glaser- 
Garbrick in the men’s 200-

Dahlen and Evans won the 
100-yard backstroke, while 
senior Jason Huber and Yu 
cleaned up in the 100-yard 
breaststroke. The 200-yard

greater sense of confidence 
going into the rest of confer­
ence play,” she said. “Our win 
against Emory and a competi­
tive game against Rochester 
has proven that we can be­
come a major competitor this 
year. We know that if we con­
tinue to work hard, and focus 
on playing together as a team, 
we can be very successful this 
year, and take everyone by
surprise.
Saturday marked the Tar­
tans’ third conference game, 
but they lost their road game 
against Case Western Reserve 
University, 49-71. Case’s de­
fense forced the Tartans to 
make 28 turnovers in the first 
half, which gave the Spartans 
a comfortable 43-24 lead 
going into the half. While 
neither team shot well, Case 
made 28 out of 34 free throws 
while the Tartans only made
23 trips to the line, making 
16. Peel recorded 12 points, 
Aunkst scored 14, and Roll 
grabbed 12 rebounds.
Carnegie Mellon contin­
ues UAA play with two home 
games this weekend, starting 
with the University of Chicago 
on Friday at 6 p.m. and Wash­
ington University at 2 p.m. on 
Sunday. This weekend is also 
the Tartans’ “Heroes Week­
end.”
first-year Price Kinney claimed 
victory in the 200-yard breast­
stroke. Hanson picked up an­
other event win for the Tar­
tans in the 500-yard freestyle, 
while DeFazio won her second 
dive event in the three-meter, 
and sophomore Eli Fatsi won 
the three-meter event for the 
men’s side.
The heavy workload 
seemed to take its toll on both 
teams on Saturday, however, 
as they went up against pe­
rennial Division III champion 
Kenyon College and Division
II program Ashland Universi­
ty. The men were only able to 
pull off one individual victory, 
while the women were able to 
take two as the Tartans fell to 
both opponents.
Despite the losses, the 
Tartans cannot help but be 
encouraged by their strong 
training and results. “Coming 
off of a training trip, it’s tough 
to be at our best every meet,” 
said sophomore Allyson Koy- 
en. “But everyone has been 
getting up for each race, and 
hopefully our strong efforts 
will carry over when we taper 
for championships.”
“We are in great shape, and 
we’ve been swimming better 
and better every weekend, 
and I think with a good rest 
for conferences we can really 
turn some heads,” Dahlen ob­
served. He, like so many play­
ers in every varsity sport at 
Carnegie Mellon, remarked, 
“Beat Emory.”
The Tartans will return 
to competition this Saturday 
against Westminister College 
in New Wilmington, Pa.

Women’s basketball beats Emory 56-47; loses to Rochester, Case
LAUREN HIRATA
Staffwriter
During winter break when 
the campus was recovering 
from a rigorous fall semester, 
the Tartans’ women’s basket­
ball team was hard at work 
during the winter break and 
into the new semester, ad­
vancing its overall record to 
8-6 and University Athletic 
Association (UAA) record to 
1-2. .
The Tartans started off 
their winter break schedule 
with a 59-53 win at Hiram 
College on Dec. 18. The victory 
was a team effort: Sophomore 
Ali Aunkst finished with 13 
points, sophomore Jacki Cor- 
tese recorded a double-double 
12 points and 10 rebounds, 
fifth-year senior Rachelle Roll 
added 11, and first-year Brit 
Phillips finished with 10. First- 
year Emily Peel grabbed 11 
boards.
After a week hiatus, the 
Tartans hit the hardwood with 
a win, 65-61, on Dec. 29 in the 
first game of the Ohio Wes­
leyan Bishop Classic/Hoops 
for Hope against Franklin Uni­
versity. Phillips ended with a 
career-high of 21 points, soph­
omore Jennifer Larsen ended 
with 15, Aunkst with 10, and 
Roll pulled down a season 
high of 12 rebounds.
In the championship game 
of the Ohio Wesleyan Bishop 
Classic/Hoops for Hope on 
Dec. 30, the Cardinal and 
Gray pulled out an entertain­
ing victory over Olivet College 
in overtime, 58-56. Though 
Carnegie Mellon was down 16 
points with 10:40 left in the 
game, the squad went on an 
astonishing 20-3 run to secure 
a lead. With 30 seconds left 
in regulation, Olivet tied the 
game and the Tartans were 
unable to answer, sending the 
game into extra minutes. A 
trey by Aunkst and a foul shot 
by Phillips secured the 58-56 
victory. Aunkst scored a ca­
reer-high 23 points and was 
named to the All-Tournament 
team. Phillips scored 14 points 
and was named the tourna­
ment’s Most Valuable Player.
Despite their productive of­
fensive, the Tartans were most 
proud of their team defense. 
Larsen stated that the whole
team “trust [s] each other and 
it really pays off for us when 
we play that way. The best 
thing we can do as a team and 
as individuals is play great de- 
.fense. We have the ability to 
play really amazing team de­
fense and when we are dedi­
cated to doing that every as­
pect of our game improves.”
Unfortunately, defense 
was not enough on Jan. 3 for 
Carnegie Mellon in their last 
non-conference game against 
Stevenson University, as they 
fell 61-63. Larsen tallied 19 
points and sophomore Nicole 
Vaccarella knocked down 16 
points.
Carnegie Mellon opened 
its UAA season on Jan. 8 with 
a 56-47 win at Emory Univer­
sity. The Tartans ended the 
first half strong with a 33-21 
lead. However, they came out 
cold from halftime as the Tar­
tans shot one for eight while 
Emory started with a 12-4 
run. However, Carnegie Mel­
lon kicked it into overdrive, 
answering with a 6-0 run to 
take a 10 point lead. Never 
looking back, the Tartans kept 
up intense defense to secure
the 56-47 win. Larsen tallied 
26 points and nine rebounds, 
Roll had a double-double with 
10 points and 13 rebounds, 
first-year Tori Baggio pulled 
down eight rebounds, and 
Phillips scored seven points 
while dishing out six assists.
The win to start confer­
ence play proved to boost 
the squad’s confidence. “We 
needed the win against Emory 
to prove to ourselves that we 
belong in this conference and 
I think everybody else was 
just as psyched as I was to get 
a victory,” Larsen said.
Unfortunately, the second 
game of UAA play ended a 
little differently for the Tar­
tans, with a hard loss, 58-51, 
at University of Rochester on 
Jan. 10. Phillips ended the 
night with 22 points, Larsen 
added 13, and Roll grabbed 
eight rebounds.
Although Carnegie Mellon 
lost a tough game to Roches­
ter, Vaccarella says the team is 
still hopeful, “After the week­
end, the team has gained a

While most students were 
lounging on the couches and 
enjoying the holidays with 
friends and family, the Carn­
egie Mellon men’s basketball 
team was knocking down free 
throws and perfecting plays. 
Over the long winter break, 
the Tartans moved their record 
to 4-9 overall and 0-3 in UAA 
play.
Just before the break, the 
Tartans hosted Heidelberg and 
Hood Colleges at the 19th an­
nual Radisson/Carnegie Mel­
lon Tournament. On Saturday, 
Nov. 28, the Tartans fell to 
Heidelberg 74-60 in the tour­
nament’s opening round. Af­
ter scoring eight unanswered 
points early in the first half, 
things were looking good for 
the Cardinal and Gray, but 
Heidelberg countered with 
a 13-point run of their own. 
Heidelberg maintained their 
lead for the rest of the half
and entered the break leading 
34-29. The Tartans challenged 
the Berg in the second half, 
taking the lead three separate 
times, but eventually fell short. 
The Tartans were led by junior 
Shane Rife with 16 points, fol­
lowed by junior Matt Pettit 
with 14 points, and senior Jack 
Anderson, who cashed in for
12 points.
On Sunday, Nov. 29, the 
Tartans took on Hood College 
in the consolation game and 
came away with a 77-67 vic­
tory.
Pettit paved the way for the 
Tartans, dropping 17 points 
and was named to the All- 
Tournament team. Three other 
Tartans finished the game in 
double digits: Anderson and 
sophomore John Duhring had 
15 points apiece, while Rife 
added 10 points and a career- 
high of five assists.
On Dec. 2, the Tartans trav­
eled to Huntingdon, Pa., to 
take on the Eagles of Juniata 
College. After only shooting
one for nine in the first five 
minutes of the game, a mas­
sive dunk by Duhring jump- 
started the Tartans to an 84- 
79 victory. Duhring was eight 
for 12 and scored 18 points in 
the first half alone. He finished 
the game with a career-high
23 points, followed by Pettit 
and Anderson with 13 and 11 
points, respectively.
The Tartans claimed their 
first winning record of the 
season on Dec. 12 as they de­
feated LaRoche College 73-58, 
improving to 4—3 overall. The 
Tartans started strong off the 
tip and took an early 8-0 lead.
The Redhawks were able to 
come within two points of the 
Tartans at the end of the half, 
but after the break, the Tar­
tans appeared unstoppable. 
Led by Anderson’s 21 second- 
half points, the Tartans took 
a double-digit lead over the 
Redhawks. Anderson finished 
the game with 27 points, while 
Pettit cashed in for 15 points 
and 12 rebounds, and Rife fin­
ished with 13 points.
After a two-week break, the 
Tartans were back in action on 
Jan. 3 playing Widener Uni­
versity on the campus of De- 
Sales University. The Tartans 
were strong in the first half 
and went into the break with 
a 35-32 lead but lost momen­
tum in the second half. Ander­
son’s career high of 28 points 
was not enough to make up 
for the Tartans’ 20 turnovers 
and poor second-half shooting 
percentage. The Tartans were 
only three and 13 from behind 
the arc and shot 33.3 percent 
in the second half.
The Tartans were unable 
to rebound from their loss to 
Widener as the fell to Alver- 
nia University on Jan. 4 at 
the Casa Mia Holiday Classic 
hosted by DeSales University. 
The Tartans dropped a 72-62 
decision despite having four 
players score in double digits.

The Carnegie Mellon 
swimming and diving teams 
have had a busy start to the 
semester, topping Case West­
ern Reserve University and Al­
legheny College before falling 
to Kenyon College and Ash­
land University in a double­
dual meet on Saturday. The 
men are now 6-2 on the year, 
while the women are 4-4.
Less than two days after 
returning from their training 
trip in Miami, Fla., the teams 
took to the starting blocks in 
Cleveland to battle Case West­
ern Reserve.
The women were victori­
ous, 133-95, and many of 
the Tartans took first in their 
respective events, including 
junior Molly Evans, who took 
first in the 100-yard back­
stroke and the 1000-yard free­
style. Senior Sara Andrews 
took the 200-yard freestyle, 
junior Brianne Burton won 
the 50-yard freestyle, and 
sophomore Victoria Adams 
beat out the competition in 
the 500-yard freestyle with a 
time of 5:20.58. Sophomore 
Olivia DeFazio also swept the 
one- and three-meter diving 
events. Junior Rebecca Ussai

Likeness redefines ‘portrait’ Everything you need to know
The Mattress Factory amazes all with new collaborative exhibit About critical dating and Carnegie creepers
Among the mirrored rooms of the Mattress Factory, 
multiple artists have collaborated to unveil their 
portrayals of post-Warholian human depiction.
In short, Likeness is anything but boring. Don’t 
expect to see formal paintings of royals dressed in 
glittering garb; instead, modern technology and 
limitless creativity bring this series of art to the 
white-washed brick rooms of the North Side gallery.
Jim Campbell, one of the artists featured in the 
exhibit, incorporates strings of LED lights to 
produce his “Liz Walking: A Distillation Portrait.” 
With alternating flashes of the LED lights that 
hang about an inch from the wall, a shadow is 
produced that looks like a person walking, but never 
moving forward. So deceiving is this shadow that 
one standing from a distance might think there is 
actually someone walking in place behind a white 
sheet.
Even as visitors travel from floor to floor via elevator, 
the art never leaves. On the ceiling of the elevator, 
a screen of monochromatically shaded LED lights 
(“Fathers of the Elevator,” also by Jim Campbell) 
forms the faces of several U.S. presidents, looking 
down on viewers as they descend to another floor of 
interesting pieces.
Paul DeMarinis’s piece, titled ‘‘Dust," should be 
classified as "living art,” considering a big part of 
the artwork involves a transformation. Here’s the 
process: Pictures of missing children paired together 
are scanned onto phosphorescent powder, which 
is able to conserve light and can therefore project a 
negative of the image. The powder doesn’t last long, 
though, and as the minutes pass, the images warp 
and distort, eventually disintegrating to the dust 
they were formed from.
"Self Portrait as a PowerPoint Proposal for an 
Amusement Park Ride,” by Jonn Herschend, tells a 
story by giving the spectator a realistic environment. 
The exhibit features a room with a running 
PowerPoint presentation, a “Wet Floor” sign sitting 
beside buckets catching water from a seemingly 
leaky roof — which you’re not entirely sure is part of 
the piece — and a janitor’s closet slightly ajar.
Joseph Mannino’s series “The Space Between,” 
features dozens of photographs, each of a single 
person with letters written on fingers or knuckles, 
and an overall aim to blur the separation among 
artist, subject, and audience. The photos are cut in 
half, thus creating two images, with some displaying 
phrases like ’’stay true,” "wet dreams,” and “got 
milk?”
Other pieces in the exhibit include Tony Oursler's 
“Vampiric Battle,” where he recreates our obsession 
with looking younger and the measures we will 
go through to get the desired effect. Nikki S. Lee’s 
“Layers” series features a drawing of someone of a 
different ethnicity layered over a drawn self-portrait. 
Greta Pratt’s digital print collection, “Liberty,” 
features everyday Americans dressed as Lady 
Liberty and working so they can come closer to the 
famous American dream.
Take a trip over to the Mattress Factory, check out 
the work of these seven artists, and your definition of 
“portrait” will never be the same again.

Dear Rohit,
There is this guy that keeps 
showing up everywhere I 
go. He doesn’t talk to me 
or anything, but it’s kind 
of unnerving to see him all 
the time. I don’t know what 
I should tell him because 
I don’t know if he’s doing 
it on purpose or what his 
intentions are. Can you 
help?
—Scared of Stalkers 
Dear SOS,
I am here to help you. That’s 
what I am paid for. Well, 
actually, I don’t get paid, but 
that’s not the point. How 
many times has Mr. Stalker 
crossed your path? If it’s 
more than five times a week, 
the probability of that being 
a coincidence is negligible, 
as our fine statistic students 
would say.
If so, you probably do have 
a stalker on your hands. You 
should have one of your guy 
friends, preferably a football 
player if that is an option, 
have a talk with him and 
figure out what his issue is.
Maybe he’s harmless and 
wants to be friends but is too 
shy to approach you. It is up 
to you to decide whether to 
pursue that friendship or not. 
If he continues to bother you, 
do let me know.
Be safe and sensible,

Dear Rohit,
I think I might be too 
picky when it comes to 
dating. I never seem to 
like guys around campus. 
Sometimes I think it’s 
better just to be alone than 
to settle for someone, but 
what if my expectations 
are too high?
—Seeing No One Better
Dear SNOB,
Firstly, you are not the only 
one with this problem. 
Carnegie Mellon has a history 
with this sort of thing. If you’re 
searching for a relationship,
I don’t think there’s any 
reason to waste your time 
with someone you’re just 
not feeling a connection 
with. It’s hard enough to find 
somebody worth dating, 
and when you factor in your 
orientation, college, and 
personal tastes, the dating 
pool continues to shrink.
Are you looking exclusively at 
Carnegie Mellon? There’s a 
whole city of boys out there 
just waiting to meet someone 
like you. I’d also suggest 
looking around online — you 
may be surprised at how 
much more open people can 
be about their preferences on 
the Internet. You shouldn’t 
really be worried about 
having high standards. It’s 
good to be picky, but you 
should always remember to 
give people a chance. You 
never know, the one you 
supposedly settled for could 
turn out to be the one you 
were looking for all along!
Someone special is near,

Tales from abroad: Grenoble
Student uncovers the perks of European culture while studying abroad in France
"The things an American who is abroad for a very long 
time misses ... weren’t the things you were supposed 
to miss,” wrote Adam Gopnik, a correspondent for The 
New Yorker living in Paris during the 1990s. “We are 
supposed to come to Europe for leisure, sunshine, a more 
civilized pace, for slowness of various kinds. America we 
are supposed to miss for its speed, its friendliness, for 
the independence of its people and the individualism of 
their lives. Yet these were not the things I missed....”
It’s true. During my four-month stay this fall in Grenoble, 
France, as an intern at the Xerox Research Centre 
Europe, I was more conscious of missing the little things 
in shared culture more than any grandiose ideals of the 
American way. The big stuff is there: French people 
consume American media, all the way from Pixar’s 
Up (re-branded in French as Là-Haut) to "Jingle Bells” 
(playing in English on the radio). It was the smaller 
points of reference that I found myself wishing for: 
being able to casually mention a weekend drive on 
1-80, for example, without having to first explain the 
U.S. interstate highway system, the terrain of central 
Pennsylvania, and. what it feels like to drive across it.
Few things either tie us together or keep us apart as 
much as geography. If anyone in France asked where I 
was from, I typically started by answering “Cleveland.”
I would start zooming out until something made a 
connection. If not Cleveland, I was from Ohio. If not 
Ohio, I was from a place halfway between New York 
and Chicago. If not that — and this became mostly my 
standard answer — I was from the United States, "in the 
center, but a little to the northeast.”
The situation was reversed when my new acquaintances 
tried to tell me where they were from. Even after nine 
'years of French classes, I found I’d only studied the "big” 
places in France. I had heard of Grenoble 
before living there,
but it wasn’t until I arrived that I knew anything about 
the actual city, its region, or most other French places. 
When I met a new person, I tried to keep the name of his 
or her hometown in my mind long enough to get back 
to a map and look it up. At least I wasn’t alone in this 
problem: I was once part of a conversation in which a girl 
from the northern city of Lille was defending her region 
against two southerners, who had lumped it in with 
Paris.
Grenoble itself presents an astonishing range of 
geography for the outdoorsy newcomer to explore, a lot 
like a few days I once spent in Boulder, Colo. A city in 
southwestern France about half the size of Pittsburgh, 
Grenoble is squished into two river valleys in the shape 
of a Y at the foot of the Alps. The flat part, laced with 
200 miles of bike lanes and trails, is a haven for bicycle 
commuters. Half an hour on a local tram puts you at 
the beginning of one of the mountain ranges and their 
hiking trails, while for an hour on a regional bus you can 
be at a couple of alpine ski resorts.
During my out-and-about time, I became aware of an 
underlying difference between the French and American 
approaches to public transportation. I mentioned one 
day at lunch to my co-worker, Claude, my amazement 
at how easy it was to get around — especially on the 
national rail network, which ran multiple trains per day 
from Grenoble to any destination I could think of. In my 
co-worker’s view, what makes this possible is that in 
France, certain services are deemed too important to 
not have, so they are provided by the government and 
funded by the people through taxes. The idea that a rail 
service should be profitable — or forced to be profitable
— seemed absurd.
The downside to funding large public services is that 
in France there’s a 19.6 percent value-added tax on 
almost everything. On the one hand, it helps pay for 
increased public services like rail networks, vacation 
time, or health care; on the other, the costs of consumer 
products or services in Grenoble are consistently 
about 50 percent above what they are in Pittsburgh. 
Debating the pros and cons of each of these systems is a 
complicated matter. On the occasions when the subject 
came up among my co-workers or acquaintances, the 
only conclusion I was ever able to draw was that it’s 
impossible to just consider health care or prices or 
vacation time alone — the way each of these things 
functions in American or French society is tightly bound 
up in the cultural system as a whole.
One of the most basic reasons for living abroad is 
to experience something "different.” Though living 
in France meant losing a large amount of shared 
experiences and cultural context with the people around 
me, it was also the best way for me to start learning new 
ones. As the weeks went by, I became more integrated 
into French life and started to rebuild a common, 
everyday framework of experiences. More importantly,
I stopped comparing the experiences to their American 
counterparts. As Gopnik had discovered before me,
I didn’t miss America’s speed, independence, and 
individualism — I learned to ignore them.

Don’t let winter weather ruin your weekend
Pittsburgh has plenty of snow-friendly activities to offer students this winter season
It’s winter in Pittsburgh, and that means that the ground 
is covered in snow and ice, effectively shutting up most 
of Carnegie Mellon’s student body inside until the spring 
thaw. Instead of hibernating for the rest of winter, try 
one of these snow-friendly activities that can be found 
around the city.
Take a glide on the wild side
Well, maybe not the “wild side," exactly, but gliding 
around the ice rinks at nearby Schenley Park or 
downtown Pittsburgh’s PPG Plaza is a perfect activity for 
a snQwy night. Skating can be a great way to bond with 
your friends, especially if you need to hold onto them to 
stay upright. This also makes it a great spot for a date. 
Schenley Park offers several college ID nights throughout 
the week, giving students a small discount and making 
the price of admission $3 (at all other times, the cost 
for adults is $4). With the cost of renting skates ($2.50), 
this is an affordable activity that’s great for winter — 
especially since it leaves enough money leftover to buy 
a steamy cup of cocoa and still stay under $10 total.
For more information on ice skating in Pittsburgh, visit 
www. city. Pittsburgh.pa. us/parks/schenleyskatingrink. 
htm or www.ppgplace.com/rink.
Get away for the weekend — on skis
Pittsburgh itself isn’t a great area for skiing or 
snowboarding, but going on a weekend trip to ski 
proves to be easy and affordable, as there are many ski 
slopes within about two hours of the city. The closest, 
Boyce Park, is located about 20 minutes away in nearby
Monroeville. The rates are fairly low, especially since its 
proximity to Carnegie Mellon does not include the cost 
of a pricey hotel. The downside? The snow isn’t always 
great, and it may lack excitement for more experienced 
skiers. For anyone looking to actually get away, Blue 
Knob Ski Resort is about a two-hour drive away and 
is home to the highest skiable mountain in the state 
according to the resort’s website, www.blueknob.com. 
Rates are reasonable and vary depending on time (the 
resort offers both four-hour and full-day passes). This 
could be either a weekend trip or a day trip, but either 
way, it’s a great way to enjoy the snow. As another 
option, Seven Springs Mountain Resort boasts the 
largest skiing area in the state. As an added bonus, this 
resort has other activities on site like bowling, indoor 
swimming, shopping, and nightclubs (for guests over
21, of course) as well as a few different kinds of lodging, 
including hotels and cabins. All three locations offer ski 
school for beginners, so even if you’ve never skied, this 
is still a great option while the snow lasts.
Take a sleigh ride with your sweetie
Nothing beats cuddling up with your significant other 
when it’s cold outside, but instead of hiding from the 
snow, take advantage of it! Horse-drawn sleigh rides are 
only available in the winter, and now is the perfect time 
to take one. Most of the sleigh rides nearby are still a bit 
of a drive away, but this romantic activity will be much 
more impressive than studying each other’s chemistry 
notes. Seven Springs (see above) offers sleigh rides in 
addition to skiing and snowboarding. Most sleigh ride 
operations stopped at the start of the new year, which
makes this activity even more special now.
Snowless activities for snowphobics
Sick of the cold and hate the snow? That doesn’t mean 
that you should stay in your room until Carnival. There 
are plenty of fun indoor activities around Pittsburgh, 
many of which are free or discounted for students. 
Pittsburgh is home to numerous art and history 
museums, all of which provide the opportunity for a 
relaxing day out. Phipps Conservatory, which is located 
on the other side of Flagstaff Hill, will help you forget 
that it’s snowy outside with its tropical plants and warm 
temperatures. On campus and off, there are indoor sports 
and fitness activities, like indoor tennis, basketball, 
and yoga, as well as opportunities to watch sporting 
events. Try attending a Carnegie Mellon athletic event 
on campus or a Penguins game at the Mellon Arena. 
Student tickets are available during the pre-game 
student rush, cutting the ticket cost to $20.

! ¦ ¦ n 'I *»* « * | ¦ ¦ ¦ m mSynthetic sounds, reggae beats, and Afro-pop
The indie-pop quartet Vampire Weekend releases sophomore album Contra to rave reviews
When Vampire Weekend released their self-titled debut 
album in January 2008, they were already riding the 
hype from the blogosphere. The album went on to sell 
half a million copies in the United States. Now, two years 
after Vampire Weekend, their sophomore album, Contra, 
might just top that record. Currently, it sits comfortably 
at number one on the iTunes Top Albums chart.
Signed to XL Recordings, the foursome hails from 
Columbia University, a factor that sometimes lands 
them the^ criticism of being preppy white kids taking 
from African sounds. Some even go so far as to accuse 
the band of ripping off Paul Simon's Graceland in their 
first album. Despite this negative backlash, Vampire 
Weekend stays true to both their Afro-pop influences and 
upper-middle-class backgrounds in Contra, as if to tell off 
the skeptics who doubted them.
Oftentimes, a sophomore album can venture too far 
from the debut, sometimes to the point where listeners 
mistake the album to be by an entirely different band. 
Other times, there is no progression between the first 
and second albums, leaving listeners with the feeling 
that they’re hearing the same songs, just with different 
lyrics. In Contra, Vampire Weekend does a wonderful job 
of standing firmly on that precariously thin line.

Vampire Weekend's second album has released to 
rave reviews all over the globe.
In this new album, fans will not only recognize the sound 
that is so clearly Vampire Weekend, but also experience 
something new: the band’s curious dabbling in synthetic 
sounds, as evidenced in "California English,” in which 
the band uses pitch correction. “Diplomat’s Son” uses 
a reggae beat while combining M.I.A. samples with 
classic rock. "Giving Up the Gun” contains wooden
percussion instruments as well as synthetic dings. The 
song “White Sky” also includes a familiar synthetic 
beat repeated from the band’s debut album Vampire 
Weekend.
Vampire Weekend released two singles from Contra 
titled “Horchata” and "Cousins.” While “Horchata” is 
cleverly written (Ezra Koenig, the band’s lead singer 
and guitarist, plays with multisyllabic words, rhyming 
“horchata” with "balaclava”) and fresh, "Cousins" leaves 
a lot to be desired. The song does not move forward, 
further evidenced by the music video, in which the band 
moves back and forth in an alley.
The album concludes with “I Think UR a Contra,” an 
echoing, somber ballad supplemented by the melancholy 
sounds of a piano. “I had a feeling once,” Koenig sings to 
an ex, “that you and I could tell each other everything.” 
He ends the album with the lines “Never pick sides, 
never choose between two, but I just wanted you." It 
would seem, in this album, that the quartet has matured. 
So whether you love them or love to hate them, give the 
album a listen. It’s worth the time.

New Year’s resolutions: Overcome failure
Follow through with your New Year’s resolution this year by remaining realistic
It’s a new year, a time of celebration, and that means we 
forget all the bad and fondly recall only the good from 
2009. Last year is no more, and to prove it many people 
mark the occasion by making New Year’s resolutions. 
These are statements meant to inspire everyone to 
accomplish some sort of goal over the course of 2010. 
Sometimes people stick with them and lose those extra
20 pounds but most people forget about them by the 
end of January and dig into their super fudge deluxe ice 
cream with fervor. As a result of this, let's take a shot 
at deconstructing some of the more common recurring 
resolutions and why people fail at keeping up with them. 
Hold on tight, people, this could get dicey.
Spend more time with family and friends
The resolution: This is a classic. According to a poll 
done by www.newsfeedresearcher.com, 50 percent of 
Americans vow this every year. And why not? There are 
24 hours in a day, and it would be nice to cut a slice out 
of every week to reach out and reconnect with people 
you are supposedly close to.
Why we fail: Ever come back after a time away from 
home and immediately wish you were gone .again? Yeah, 
that’s why people can’t spend more than a few minutes
a day with their families. Don’t forget the fact that you 
are the most important person in your life. Alone time is 
key to staying sane in this world.
Keep fit, lose weight, eat healthier
The resolution: Let’s face it, Americans are fat. 
Sometimes even ridiculously fat. In fact, according to 
The New York Times health guide, roughly two-thirds of 
Americans are considered overweight or obese. Riding 
a bike, walking some odd miles each day, or even eating 
an apple instead of that cobbler are great ways to get rid 
of that gut.
Why we fail: Nobody actually wants to be fat, yet every 
year there are more and more unhealthy people around. 
People just cannot control themselves. You tell yourself 
one cookie per week, then it ends up being two or 12. 
You lose five pounds, then celebrate with chocolate cake. 
It’s as if people are predisposed to obsessing over the 
unhealthiest foods.
Learn something new
The resolution: Working on a new skill is never a 
bad idea. We are curious people at heart who enjoy
experiencing new things and becoming talented in 
different ways. The world is filled with interesting 
theories, items, and places that are just begging for you 
to learn about them.
Why we fail: The problem with this one is that it is 
too broad. For example, did you know that the Times 
Square ball that drops every year weighs 11,875 pounds 
and descends 77 feet starting at 11:59 p.m.? No, you 
didn’t, so you just learned something new. Has the 
resolution been accomplished? Technically it has, so by 
mid-January people will forget their ultimate dream of 
learniifg how to build the Titanic out of toothpicks and 
go about life as if their resolution was never even made.
Here’s to hoping your New Year’s resolution is a little 
more attainable so your 2010 doesn’t turn into a tailspin 
or flameout of all your hopes and dreams.

Ritchie Reinvents a classic with Sherlock Holmes
Holmes is transformed into a comedic character full-on action hero in this director’s modern take
Long before the airing of Monk, another eccentric 
private investigator fought crime using his own unique 
methods. Residing at No. 221B Baker Street, Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle’s character Sherlock Holmes is possibly 
the most famous fictional detective in the world. Holmes 
prowled through the streets of London and across the 
pages of 56 short stories and four novels, as well as over 
211 films, and this past year he made his most recent 
appearance in Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes.
Robert Downey Jr. joins the list of 76 actors who have 
portrayed Sherlock Holmes in the past. Becoming one 
of the most depicted movie characters in history is a 
daunting challenge in itself. As with other directors who 
were faced with the task of converting a well-loved story 
into a movie, Ritchie dealt with the problem of creating a 
new production while remaining true to the story itself.
Sherlock Holmes begins with the Baker Street detective 
and his good friend and chronicler Dr. Watson, played 
by Jude Law, preventing a human sacrifice by a 
mysterious cult. Good old Inspector Lestrade shows 
up, late as usual, to apprehend a key figure in the cult: 
Lord Blackwell, prominent in high society, politics, and 
apparently witchcraft as well. Blackwell is executed after 
delivering mysterious words of warning to Holmes, who 
takes the foreboding message nonchalantly and falls
into a fit of boredom in the weeks following the arrest. 
Blackwell is duly hanged, and Watson himself declares 
the lord dead, but the sentence turns out to be not as 
binding as expected.
This film can be characterized as an attempt to turn the 
classic story of Sherlock Holmes into a true Hollywood 
action-packed adventure, to the point of Ritchie adding 
a few pieces of his own. All the big-league characters of 
Holmes lore are present, including Irene Adler — played 
by Rachel McAdams -•—who was always known to 
Holmes as “the” woman, and his arch-nemesis, Professor 
Moriarty.
Ritchie has included many aspects of the books in his 
movie, including several scenes from the anthologies. 
When bored, Downey Jr.'s Holmes does indeed shoot a 
patriotic V.R. into his room’s wall, he tests poisons on 
his own dog, and he retains his boxing prowess and 
connections among the London criminal underworld.
On the infamous Irene Adler, a romantic tension and 
near make-out scene between her and Holmes was 
inevitable in a movie version. As the most mysterious 
and dangerous female character, her performance was 
mildly interesting to follow, but not enthralling or as 
haunting or memorable as the original character would
lead the audience to believe. “By far, it was one of the 
worst acting jobs by a leading lady I’ve seen in a long 
time,” Aurelia Henderson, a first-year in H&SS majoring 
in creative writing announced. “Nothing about her was 
bad-ass.”
The plot was intriguing and far more interesting in 
its final reveal as a story of logic and lust for power, 
a web spun by the mortal but intimidating hands of 
Professor Moriarty rather than a fanciful black magic 
theme. A conflict not much remarked upon in the books 
became a central issue in the movie — that of Watson 
leaving bachelorhood and adventures behind to live a 
quiet married life. This new issue effectively brought 
Holmes’ and Watson’s characters and relationships to 
light, allowing the audience to better know them while 
providing an opportunity for wonderful banter and quick 
wit between the two friends.
Amidst pistol and fist fights, seductions, and journeys 
to the high waters of both treason and the Thames, this 
film presents a highly exaggerated version -of the mystery 
classic, which, though giving new audiences a false 
image of the books themselves, is entertaining.

The Informant!
Thursday, Jan. 21 
7:30 10 12:30
Based on the exclamation point in 
the title of the film, you would think 
The Informant! is simply going to 
be in some way a silly film. In fact, 
the flick is more of a dark comedy 
based on true events from the early 
’90s about price fixing. In it, we 
follow Mark Whiteacre, played by 
Matt Damon, the president at Archer 
Daniels Midland, who becomes 
an informant for the FBI when he 
confesses to collaborating with other 
executives to fix the price of lysine. 
Fun fact: Matt Damon put on 20 
to 30 pounds to portray the pudgy 
Whiteacre.
This Is IT
Friday, Jan. 22 
7:30 10 12:30
This Is IT was the title of the a 
canceled 2009-2010 tour that Michael 
Jackson was preparing to go on 
before his unexpected death last 
year at the age of 50. It documents 
the preparations that Jackson was 
going through at the time, including 
rehearsals, auditions, and designs 
for the tour. None of the footage was 
intended for release, but following 
Jackson’s death, producers agreed 
to release it for one last look at the 
man who was the King of Pop. It also 
helped that director Kenny Ortega paid 
a small fortune for the rights to the 
footage. It is a fitting farewell to one of 
the greatest voices of the 20th century.

As part of Late Night this weekend,
AB films and Alpha Kappa Alpha have 
joined forces to give us Poetic Justicer 
a 1993 drama/romance film starring 
Janet Jackson, Tupac Shakur, and Maya 
Angelou. It tells the story of Justice, a 
young African-American poet who tries 
to find meaning in her life with the help 
of others and her poetry. Alpha Kappa 
Alpha (AKA) is the first historically black 
Greek letter sorority. AKA does work 
promoting high scholastic standards and 
unity among college women regardless 
of social status. Fun fact: Maya Angelou 
is a member of the AKA sorority.
Sorority Row
Sunday, Jan. 24

Sorority Row is a horror film released 
a few months ago that stars a bunch 
of “hot” half-dressed chicks in a 
sorority. Audrina Partridge makes an 
appearance in the film as well as one 
of Bruce Willis’ daughters, Rumor. 
After the girls accidentally kill a fellow 
sister, they think alMs well and cover 
up the death and all accusatory 
evidence. But oh how wrong they 
were. Near the end of the school year 
someone starts killing people left and 
right, but who is it? Could this be the 
angry return of their former sister?
Fun fact: Leia Organa plays the 
housemother.

Locals incorporate arts in Martin Luther King Day celebrations
An afternoon of arts to commemorate an esteemed leader of the civil rights movement
\ by Alex Yuschik | Staffwriter 1 ^'eL J champion of the
civil rights movement and one of the greatest orators of
all time, Martin Luther King Jr. was truly an individual
who changed history. His masterful speeches motivated
millions, while his non-violent method of protest ushered
in a new era of peaceful public movements for change.
In an effort to keep his legacy alive and to commemorate
his life and accomplishments, the Martin Luther King
Jr. Day celebrations at Carnegie Mellon promise to be'
both an informative and appreciative look at how far the
country has come and a reminder of what work must still
be done to truly ensure equality in our society today.
While many students at Carnegie Mellon have been 
celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day with a half day 
off from school for as long as they can remember, most 
are probably unaware of the struggles behind its being 
established as a national holiday. A bill to establish 
King's birthday, Jan. 15, as a national holiday was 
twice introduced to Congress, only passing the second 
time. Some states, such as Illinois, Massachusetts, 
and Connecticut, had already established state-wide 
holidays commemorating the activist’s birth, but the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference collected 
3 million signatures in order to press the government 
to make the day a national holiday. The first attempt 
was stalled in Congress for eight years until it received
the support of President Jimmy Carter, though it was 
ultimately defeated in the House by a margin of five 
votes.
King’s widow, Coretta Scott King, was not disheartened. 
She worked a political angle, garnering the support 
of governors and mayors across the country. In 1980, 
Stevie Wonder also lent his talents to the cause; his song 
“Happy Birthday" motivated the public support for the 
holiday to be made national. With 6 million signatures 
in favor of the holiday, the second bill was passed by the 
House but faced an even tougher fight in the Senate. At 
last, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was signed into law in 
November 1983 by President Reagan, though it was not 
officially celebrated until 1986. Even then, the holiday 
was still not celebrated by all states under that name. 
Many protests occurred through the years to rectify this, 
one of the most famous being the moving of Super Bowl 
XXVn from Arizona to California. At long last, though it 
might seem surprising given it how recently it occurred, 
all 50 states celebrated the holiday in 2000. This year 
marks the first decade in which all 50 states have joined 
in the festivities.
Celebrations happening on campus and in the 
Pittsburgh area this year involve a medley of the arts as 
a tribute to King. Just as the arts have been a boon to 
the civil rights movement in the past, they continue to
Tommy Hoffman | Photo Staff
provide a sounding board and a venue for new ideas to 
be expressed.
The arts have always been integral to the spread of 
hope and belief, as well as effective at rallying people to 
action at injustices suffered. It was no different during 
King’s protests. While Wonder's hit song helped to propel 
the second bill for Martin Luther King Jr. Day through 
Congress, it was by no means the only contribution the 
arts had in the civil rights movement. Other famous 
songs of protest include Bob Marley’s “Blowin' in the 
Wind” and “Eve of Destruction” by Barry McGuire, not 
to mention countless other protest songs chanted at 
marches and demonstrations. To this day, popular songs 
are still used to protest political dealings, current events, 
and most often war.
Rhetoric has also held a treasured place in civil rights 
history thanks to King. His famous speeches not only

inspired his listeners with their content, but also by their 
adroit choice of words and skillful presentation. Over the 
course of his involvement with the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference as well as independently,
King’s command of his audience and infallible oratory 
acumen allowed him to win over countless supporters 
and earn the admiration of many others. According to 
AmericanRhetohc.com, King has three speeches in the 
100 greatest speeches of the 20th century. His “I Have 
a Dream" speech holds the number-one spot, while the 
two others make the top 50 and one of them, “I’ve Been 
to the Mountaintop,” is in the top 15.
Through music and voice, the civil rights movement 
relied on the arts to help carry its message. Now, the 
tradition of the arts as a medium for ideas and new 
thought is continued in Pittsburgh and on campus. At 
Carnegie Mellon, the observation of the holiday will kick 
off at noon today with singing, verse, and interpretation 
from the School of Drama and Music in Kirr Commons 
in the University Center. Next will follow President 
Jared Cohon’s State of Diversity address in McConomy 
Auditorium. At 1:30 p.m., high school students and 
students who have received awards from the creative 
writing program, Student Affairs, and the Office of the
President will read works in the Rangos Hall in which 
they discuss their personal experiences of race and 
discrimination. Also included in the festivities are a 
puppet show and a candlelit procession occurring later 
in the day. (For a full schedule of events taking place at 
the university for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, please see 
the front page.)
In the Pittsburgh area, many activities are being held to 
celebrate diversity. Oakland will host its eighth annual 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the Park, which will consist 
of ice skating, sledding, and art projects in Schenley Park 
on Monday from 1 to 4 p.m. Other areas around the city 
will hold various events: The Carnegie Science Center 
will offer free admission, the Campbell Memorial Chapel 
at Chatham University will also offer a program of spoken 
word, song, and dance, as well as many others places 
around Pittsburgh. Many venues are also collecting 
donations for the Haiti relief effort as a tribute to the 
work of King.
East Liberty has long been famous for its celebrations 
of the holiday. This year, the Kelly-Strayhorn Theatre 
featured the performance East Liberty Celebrates Martin 
Luther King, Jr.! on Saturday. The event was free and
combined the talents of many local dance, theater, and 
hip-hop groups to form its tribute.
Let Freedom Sing! is also another fun event going on 
during the holiday, taking place on Monday starting at 7 
p.m. at the Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville. 
The event features a musical tribute to King, and while 
free, any donations will go toward building a Martin 
Luther King Jr. monument on the National Mall in 
Washington, D.C.
While students may be happy to have no classes after 
12:30 p.m., it is important to remember why exactly 
these celebrations are being held. Though King was a 
brilliant orator and someone who believed in equality, 
he was also courageous as seen by leading peaceful 
protests despite fierce opposition. While having classes 
until lunchtime might come as an unwelcome change 
for some, the activities happening on campus and all 
around the city ensure that students will not only be able 
to find a fun way to spend their afternoon, but also honor 
the person whose great sense of conviction, skill, and 
bravery gave so much more to this country than a free 
Monday in January.

Delectable treats to warm your soul
Combat the snow with these simple yet tasty recipes
It’s the start of the new semester, and for those of 
us who fear the snow and icy wind, this begins the 
start of the dorm-room lockdown period. Staying in 
can often get boring or repetitive — one can only 
watch so many movies — and we may find ourselves 
searching desperately for some fresh and exciting 
activities to partake in. This week, instead of the 
usual day to night tasks, try gathering some friends 
together and whipping up these delicious recipes in 
your dorm kitchen.
Marble Bark:
Ingredients: 6 squares of semi-sweet baking 
chocolate, 6 squares of white baking chocolate, 1 
cup crushed peppermint candies, 1 tsp. peppermint 
extract
Note: Use 17 ounces dark chocolate and 10 ounces 
white chocolate chips.
1. Microwave the semi-sweet and white 
chocolates in separate medium microwavable 
bowls on high for two minutes or until almost 
melted, stirring halfway through heating time.
2. Stir until completely melted.
3. Stir 1/2 cup of the peppermint candies into each 
bowl.
4. Add 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract to each 
bowl.
5. Alternately spoon melted chocolates onto wax 
paper-lined cookie sheet.
6. Swirl chocolates together with knife to 
marbleize.
7. Refrigerate one hour or until firm.
8. Break into pieces.

Note: Use mini food processor to crush peppermint 
candies.
Penuche Fudge:
Ingredients: 1 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1 cup 
packed brown sugar, 1/3 cup light cream, 1/3 cup 
milk, 2 tbsp. butter or margarine, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 
cup walnut pieces
1. Butter a nine-inch square baking dish. Butter 
the sides of a heavy two-quart saucepan.
2. Combine sugars, cream, milk, and butter in

to be the perfect treat to serve with a cup of hot 
chocolate or as a refreshing dessert.

baking dish.
7. Score while warm and cut when firm.

thick.

wedges in place.
8. Prick each wedge three times with a fork.

Your semester starts on a depressing note when you find out 
that the introductory philosophy course you signed up for is 
actually a 400-level math course with no office hours.
Your History of Vampirism class will take an interesting turn 
when the midterm presents you with a choice of killing a 
vampire or turning into one.
Consider this: A train is traveling east from Boston at 60 miles 
per hour. A second train is traveling west from San Francisco 
at 90 miles per hour. The airspeed velocity of an unladen 
swallow is unaffected.
Your academic career takes a significant downturn when you 
compete with a friend to see how many Facebook games 
you can simultaneously maintain. In your defense, the friend 
cheats and hires a child to do it for him.
Hiring someone to shave your entire body so you look more 
attractive for that special man or woman may have been a 
good idea, but having him/her use a machete was definitely 
not.
If you believe in horoscopes, you will have an awful, terrible 
week. However, if you don’t believe that the ebb and flow of 
your life can be predicted by looking at a handful of stars, 
your week will be fairly average.
After the announcement that a new punctuation mark has 
been created to denote sarcasm, you devote 10 years of 
your life to creating a cheaper, faster, and open-source 
version. •
Quickly find the nearest retailer that purveys baked goods. In 
the bakery aisle, on the third loaf of rye bread you inspect, 
you will find that the middle slice has the face of Charles 
Lindbergh.
You think you’re in for a tense afternoon when your father 
puts on The Birds and the Bees: A Forbidden Love, but it is 
just a documentary about the rare African bee-finch.
Though hiring an exotic dancer dressed as a police officer for 
a party is fun, it is now considered passe. Hire a beekeeper- 
themed exotic dancer for a more modern party, but make 
sure they use real bees.
Though it may be autobiographical, the documentation of 
your life as a sitcom is just too unrealistic to sell to any major 
television network.
Abnormal Psychology sounds like an interesting class, but 
when the professor makes you a case study in the first week, 
you decide that maybe the class isn’t worth taking after all.
