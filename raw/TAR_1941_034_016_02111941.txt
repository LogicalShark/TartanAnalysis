Dioramas Depict 
Steel Operations
Steel will be manufactured in 
miniature at Carnegie Tech when 
a portion of the World’s Fair ex­
hibit of the United States Steel 
Subsidiaries is installed here in 
a few weeks.
Three of the four original me­
chanical dioramas are being pre­
sented to Tech and are to be in­
stalled in Engineering Hall, where 
at the touch of a button the min­
iature machinery of the blast 
furnace, open hearth and the roll­
ing mill will operate just as it does 
in a life-size mill.
Exhibit in Eng:. Hall
Plans originally called for the 
installation in the Faculty Room, 
but the expansion of the defense 
program has made the location 
unavailable. The gift will there­
fore be placed in • Engineering 
Hall along the wall where the 
lockers now stand between the 
two stairways. The lockers will 
be moved to Industries.
The exhibit will be built into 
the building to form a permanent 
part of it. The arrangement will 
be such that cyclic controls will 
be installed in order that the ap­
paratus will not be running con­
tinuously. However, anyone will 
be able to view the operations, 
merely by presssing a button 
which will set the machinery in 
motion. Plans are being made to 
place highly technical charts and 
flow sheets near the exhibit to ex­
plain and clarify the operations of 
steel making.
Actual Operations Shown
The dioramas built to exact de­
tail at l/25th actual size tell a 
continuous story of steelmaking, 
with many pieces of machinery 
operating just as they do in an 
actual steel mill, telling a minia­
ture steelmaking story in three 
dimensions The exhibit is meant 
to give all engineering students an 
insight into industrial processes 
in general and steelmaking in 
particular. The equipment will al­
so be used in connection with the 
Department of Metallurgy.
Arts Will Hold 
Special Election
In a special election next Tues­
day morning Art School students 
will choose a new Vice President 
of the Arts’ Senate, and conse­
quently a new member of Student 
Council, since the Vice-President 
of the Arts’ Senate is a voting 
member of Council.
The election is necessitated be­
cause Patty Haislip, who formerly 
held the office, was forced to drop 
out of school. Petitions for the 
office are due in the Student Coun­
cil Office on or before this Fri­
day.
Honoraries Hold 
Dance Saturday
Inter-Honorary Council will 
hold an informal dance at Thistle 
Hall this Saturday, February 15th, 
starting at 9 P. M.
Admission is $1.00 per couple 
and the proceeds will go to the 
general treasury of the council 
whose purpose is to promote schol­
arship, culture, and character 
among Carnegie students.
Music for the occasion will be 
provided by Tech’s own Willie 
Good, popular senior of the music 
department. Willie has his own 
nine-piece band and has a reputa­
tion for playing Sweet Swing 
music. The band had been to­
gether for nearly five years and 
has played at numerous Pitts­
burgh night spots. Nearly all 
popular bands have some sort of 
a slogan which expresses the ef­
fect of their music and Willie 
Good is no exception: “If you don’t 
dance you should, because it’s 
music by GOOD!”
This is the first time that a 
dance will be jointly sponsored 
by the day and night school hon­
oraries; and this cooperativeness 
has been received favorably by 
both the day school and night 
school Student bodies.
The honoraries are working 
hard to make this event an an­
nual one and would greatly ap­
preciate the support of the stu­
dent body.

teaching schedule has been reduc­
ed to enable him to help the Pres­
ident on special assignments.
Professor Wright was born in 
Bedford, Pennsylvania, on May 20, 
1904. He is a graduate of Haver- 
ford College and Harvard Univer­
sity. He has been at Carnegie 
since 1927 except for a year’s 
leave during which he-taught Eng­
lish at Haverford College.
“Mortality” 
Abou t Normal
“Mortality” of students who 
have dropped from the roll of 
CIT between semesters this year 
is “just about normal” according 
to^jE. K. Collins, registrar. Re­
sults of registration show that «130 
students did not return to school 
for the second semester.
The College of Engineering suf­
fered most, approximately six per 
cent, or 75 students dropping out. 
The Arts School and Margaret 
Morrison lost 26 and 29 students 
respectively for a decrease of five 
per cent in each case.
Tech’s total enrollment is now 
2,243 students, 1,238 of whom are 
engineers, 454 art students, 504 
Margaret Morrison girls, and 37 
Library School students. There 
we&e 2,375 students registered the 
first semester.t

Individual Groups 
To Hold Discussion 
Throughout Week
Three outstanding speakers, rep­
resenting the Protestant, Jewish 
and Catholic religions, will con­
duct chapel services at 11:30 to­
day in the Little Theater.
This afternoon at 4:30 these 
same men will conduct a round­
table discussion in the Union. 
Here students will have a chance 
to take part in a discussion of the 
subjects talked about in Chapel.
Dr. Robert Connely, from Cath­
olic University, Washington, D. C., 
will be the Catholic speaker; in­
cidentally he is the director of 
the Commission on American Cit­
izenship of the Catholic University 
of America. Representing the 
Jewish faith will be Dr. Nathan A. 
Perilman, formerly of the Beth- 
Shalom Temple of Pittsburgh and 
now Rabbi of the Emmanu-El 
Congregation of New York City. 
Dr. Everett R. Clinchy, President 
of the National Council of Chris­
tians and Jews, will be the Pro­
testant speaker.
Throughout the week (see 
schedule) the men’s and wolnen’s 
dormitories and the fraternities 
will have as dinner speakers re­
ligious leaders from the Pittsburgh 
area. The Women’s Y-cabinet 
meets at 4:00 P. M. tomorrow at 
the Union to hear the Rev. Fran­
cis X. Foley of Mount Mercy 
Academy. The Citcom Clan will 
meet at 4:30 Friday afternoon to 
hear Dr. C. J. Williamson, and 
next Tuesday the Lutheran Group 
will close the week with a com­
bined mooting ol! Tech, Pitt, and 
P. C. W. at the Union to hoar the 
Rev. Elmer P. Wentz.
This is the third year pi the 
observance or Religious Emphasis 
Week, inaugurated in 1939 by the 
National Council ol! Churches. It 
was so successful that many col­
leges—among these Tech—decided 
to arrange individual programs. 
The purpose of Tech's program is 
to correlate the religious and cam­
pus life of its students.
Chairman of the week's activi­
ties is Dr. Ii. L. Lang, head of the 
General Science Department in 
Margaret Morrison. Also on the 
committee are Dr. B. E. Warden, 
Dean of Men, Prof. Lawler of the 
English Department, Miss Hays of 
Margaret Morrison, and several 
students from the Men’s and 
Women’s Y-cabinets, Jim Wills, 
DeForest Trautman, Bill New­
man, and Clara May Mackey.
Dr. Miller Speaks 
At Arts Forum
Dr. Nathan Miller, professor, of 
Economics, will address the new­
ly formed Carnegie Arts Forum 
next Tuesday at 11:30 in the The­
atre, College of Fine Arts. He will 
phrase his short fifteen minute 
discussion in the interrogative— 
“What Have We To Defend?” At 
the completion of his talk, he will 
open the Forum to the student 
audience.
The Forum, which is open to the 
entire school, will hold student 
meetings at regular intervals, 
dealing with current events and 
current trends.
Arthur Glamser, Arch. ’41, and 
Howard A. Silverman, P and D, 
’42, organized this enterprise 
and are acting as co-chairmen. 
Advertising is being handled by 
Robert Smith and James Balmer, 
P and D, ’43. Skeleton committees 
have been formed throughout the 
Arts school to act as a hub on 
which the Forum will rotate. All 
departments are or will be repre­
sented.

acter.
Mind you, we’re not referring to 
all girls. Some are quite fair,, but 
a good portion fall in the above 
category.
A remedy to this situation could 
follow one of three possible 
courses: 1. Kindly ask the offend­
ers to take places at end of line. 
Be frank. Embarrassment may 
provide the means of correcting 
the attitude of the girls. 2. Be 
just as crude and inconsiderate 
by duplicating their actions on a 
much larger scale — but this is 
really not a remedy, only a count­
er-offensive, so to speak. This 
should be only the last resort. 3. 
Conduct a campaign, publicizing 
the offense and other similar ones. 
Indeed, the best remedy is mere­
ly a reconsideration on the girls 
part. We, as well as the rest of 
the fellows, are rather tired of 
playing the gentlmen to these 
products of selfish environment.

THE BOYS.

Today’s Chapel Opens 
Religions Kmpliasis Week
Today’s Chapel and the discussion at The Union this after­
noon open the major portion. oJ: Religious Emphasis Week. These 
two major meetings will provide much oJ; the basis for the small­
er,. more intimate discussions which will continue throughout 
the week.
The significance of these discussions will be a measure of how 
seriously we take them, ancl how much critical thought we are 
willing to apply in relating them to our part in today’s world 
crisis.
More than ever before America needs a rededication to hu­
manitarian principles. We must apply those principles earnestly 
and honestly, without hypocrisy. Too often have we set them 
up as criteria upon which to judge other nations, forgetting that 
we ourselves were not living up to them.
Course in Mstrriage is a Step 
In the Right Direction
Education is coming out of the realm of the theoretical and 
getting into the realm of the practical. An example of how col­
lege education can be made to deal with actual, everyday problems 
which the college graduate is bound to face is Tech’s new course 
in marriage relations. Mr. Risedorph, who teaches the course with 
the able assistance of his wife, has been able to stimulate thought 
on problems which most people fail to consider until they are act­
ually up against them.
Marriage today is far more complex than it was in the days 
of hoop skirts. In those days, the newly-married couple relied 
to a much greater extent upon their family than is possible in our 
less secure, cosmopolitan way of life. Adjustments that were 
once made under the benign eyes of doting parents must now 
be made with almost' no help besides the natural intelligence and 
flexibility of personality with which the two people find them­
selves equipped.
That is why we are now faced with the problem of prepara­
tion for marriage. It is a problem that can no longer be dealt 
with in a haphazard manner. How to arrange a family budget is 
probably-not "the most profound question a. college student will 
be asked to solve, but statistics show that failure to reach a def­
inite financial understanding has disrupted a good many happy 
homes.
Whatever preparation college can contribute to young peo­
ple in meeting these problems will help to smooth the road. The 
divorce'rate in the United States for causes which could'easily 
have been avoided by adequate understanding of the problems to 
be faced is apalling.
Carnegie’s course is not perfect, by any means. Perhaps it 
can be said that no course can cover in one semester the social, 
economic, and psychological problems involved in marriage and 
the preparation for marriage. But Carnegie’s course does give 
the student a perspective, and paints the broad outlines which lie

Bull Session . . .
Dear Editor,
Strange as it seems, we had to 
have a bull session the other night 
on religion. The session itself 
was funny, but the purpose be­
hind it was still funnier.
It all started when one of the 
boys explained shine bones to an­
other. When the explanation bor­
dered on^o evolution, the former 
talked carefully in order to keep 
from offending the latter. Then,
ft/«# VoVl • • •
along happened a third figure— 
one who believed thoroughly in 
evolution, or in anything scien­
tific, for that matter. He asked 
for the loan of an Old Testament 
to lull him to sleep. When he ex­
plained his purpose, the first par­
ticipant mentioned the Great 
Flood, and an argument ensued 
which brought in the roommate 
of the last debater.
Well, the bull session started on 
science versus religion, but none

of us knew enough about it to 
really talk, so it slowly swung 
into a campaign of maneuver, try­
ing to force each other to snow 
proof which we knew he couldn’t. 
The argument finally resolved it­
self into definitions of terms and 
demands for explanations, for, by 
now we were in over our heads 
and, unable to answer satisfac­
torily, we began to make the other 
explain his side out of existence.
For two long hours we argued 
hot arid loud, with the discussion 
finally developing into the pro­
cess of defining terms with less 
understandable phrases. We even 
got into the tenth dimensions! 
Where did we get? We didn’t) get 
anywhere, for each of us came 
out convinced that he was right 
and the other was wrong. I, for 
one, will stick to religion as long 
as there is one, and I am going 
to the. chapel today to see what 
some, experts have to say.

Hunger Complaint . . .
February 6, 1941, 
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Mr. Shatzkin:
Trying to catch a bite in the 
Grill between 12:30 and 1:30 is at 
the very best a long and tiresome 
affair. But waiting in line like 
a gentleman, at least a bit on the 
reserved side, and having a group 
of well-mannered(?) bits of 
feminity squeeze into line ahead 
of you, because one of their girl 
friends is there, is just too much.
We believe that the girls must 
think the boys. are jackasses; at 
least they act that way. While 
everyone else is waiting im­
patiently to get food, the girls, 
who have just come in, move up 
and get in line with their friends. 
The boys, gentlemen as they are, 
do nothing but acquiesce, mut­
tering dire phrases under their 
breath. As for progress — you 
either stay in the same place or 
move backwards. By the time 
you do reach the counter, there is 
just about time to gulp down a 
mouthful and rush off to class,
It seems strange that college 
girls can be so hypocritical. On 
many occasions they have com­
plained about the rowdiness and 
poor manners of the fellows, yet 
they, “in full possession of their 
faculty, with malice of fore­
thought,” persist in displaying 
sellfish and inconsiderate char-

Sgt. Sommers 
Is Seriously 111
Sergeant Raymond Sommers, in­
structor in the basic R. O. T. C. 
course and coach of Tech’s cham­
pionship Rifle Team has been con­
fined to Major Walter Reed Hos­
pital in Washington, D. C. for 
treatment of a serious back ill­
ness. Doctors at the hospital have 
been unable to diagnose the na­
ture of the illness, and it is doubt­
ful that Sergeant Sommers will 
be back at Tech before the next 
school term.
The R. O. T. C. Department also 
announces that Second Lt. Shaffer 
has been temporarily promoted to 
a First Lieutenancy. Lt. Shaffer 
has been selected along with four

We hope Helen Harrison had a 
smooth time—she certainly was

Exactly what was the business 
proposition that took Bill Minkel

noon tea date last week? It 
sounded more like “proposition” 
than “business” to us.

Bagpipers Needed 
Uy Kiltie Band
Can you wheeze? Or squeeze?
More bagpipers are needed by 
the Kiltie Band. Anyone is eligi­
ble to try out. Musical experi­
ence is desirable, but not abso­
lutely necessary. The only cost 
involved is the practice chart and 
the first Cow lessons.
It is the aim of the Kiltie Band 
to improve the bagpipe section 
and this can only be done.by add­
ing new members.
After a long struggle last year, 
the Band succeeded in adding a 
bagpipe section. It now presents 
an opportunity for a lew students 
to help preserve a bit of Carnegie 
color and spirit which it feels is 
on the wane.
Those interested should get in 
touch with Ed Lewis, Music, ’41,

Council Debates 
Reorganization 
Of Honoraries
At the first Student Council 
meeting of the new semester, 
James Sions presented a plan to 
reorganize the men’s class hon­
oraries. The aim of the plan is 
to eliminate the possibility of a 
group perpetuating itself in the 
societies. To accomplish this pur­
pose, Mr. Sions suggested a point 
system, in which factors and ac­
tivities would be the basis for 
judging the merits of the men. 
Because the plan was too exten­
sive to be discussed by the entire 
Council, Mr. Floyd appointed Mr. 
Cullen and Mr. Wills to work 
with Mr. Sions in further develop­
ing the plan before the next 
meeting.
Preceding the reading of the 
reorganization plan, the motion 
concerning the Publication Board, 
which was tabled at the last meet­
ing, was withdrawn by its author, 
Lester Cullen. Council accepted 
Mr. Cullen’s proposal of with­
drawal on the grounds that a 
Publication Board entailed more 
dangers of censorship than he had 
realized when he proposed the

Seniors Today
Mr. Beatty, Head of the Em­
ployment Bureau at Carnegie will 
give a talk today in room 104 
Ind. that will interest all seniors. 
He will talk on “Selective Serv­
ice,” “Reserve Officers Status,” 
“Employment Opportunities,” with 
special emphasis on the R. O. T. C. 
graduate’s position. The subject 
of draft and employment is vital 
to all graduates and thè informa­
tion Mr. Beatty has to oifer will 
be helpful in making decisions on 
employment. The engineers’ 
status in the selective service is 
unusual, and seniors should take 
advantage of this opportunity to 
determine their army status.
plan. Mr. Floyd then presented 
a petition that had been given to 
him by Mr. Hiram Milton of the 
University of Pittsburgh, con­
cerning the matter of lower trans­
portation rates for students on the 
Pittsburgh Railways. William 
Heilman was appointed to work on 
this matter with Mr. Milton.
Council will meet tonight at 
7:00 o’clock, when Mi\ Sions’ plan 
will be further discussed.

Paul Robeson Coming
To Carnegie Music Hall
- ¦ - ______<•.
After four triumphant years 
abroad, Paul Robeson, great bass- 
baritone, has returned to make a 
cross-country tour that brings him 
to Pittsburgh on Wednesday 
evening, February 19 at 8:30.
For his appearance in Carnegie 
Music Hall, under the auspices 
of the Centre Avenue Branch Y. 
M. C. A., Mr. Robeson will be as­
sisted by his accompanist of many 
seasons, Lawrence Brown, and 
Clara Rockmore, virtuoso of - the 
theremin. This extraordinary con­
cert program will include: “Go 
Down, Moses,” “Swing Low, 
Sweet Chariot,” “Oh, No, John,” 
“Night,” “The Silent Room,” “The 
Prayer,” “The Orphan,” “After 
the Battle,” “Sometimes I Feel 
Lak a Motherless Chile,” “Joshua 
Fit de Battle of Jericho,” all of 
which will be sung by Mr. Robe­
son. Miss Rockmore will present 
“Arioso,” “Andante from Sym­
phonic Espagole,” “Romanie,”

“Piece en Forme do Habanera,” 
and “Requiebros.” Audiences will 
appreciate the rare opportunity of 
.hearing Mr. Robeson sing foreign 
folk songs, first in English, and 
then in the language of the re­
spective countries.
Mr. Robeson’s career is a suc­
cession of meteoric achievements 
not in one field of endeavor, but 
in many. At Rutgers University, 
he was acclaimed a football hero, 
and was picked as an-All-Ameri­
can end by .vports writers. He 
studied law at Columbia, but turn­
ed to the theatre to make a bril­
liant debut in Eugene O’Neill’s 
“Emperor Jones.” His success as 
an actor was instantaneous and 
he appeared thereafter in “All 
God’s Chillun,” “Porgy,” “Black 
Boy,” and “Show Boat.” Bril­
liant triumphs on the screen fol­
lowed for Paul Robeson. There 
is a heightened mood of mysticism 
in his singing, as though he had 
penetrated the soul of his people. 
In spirit, he is the mouthpiece of 
folk music, and there is no great­
er folk singer in the world today.
In music, Paul Robeson be­
lieves, the Negro makes a definite 
contribution to art. That is why 
tftS" great Negro singer. 'Win in­
clude a wealth of spirituals in his 
concert program. He presents 
with utmost simplicity genuine 
outpourings of a suffering people. 
Although Mr. Robeson was more 
than twenty before he began to 
sing in public, and was better- 
known as an athlete and actor, 
the music of his people 'had 
haunted him persistently. He has 
no favorite music, but he shares 
the public’s deep love for “Ole 
Man River.”
Tickets priced at $1.00, $1.50 
and $2.00 are on sale at the branch, 
2621 Centre Avenue and at Mel- 
lor’s, 604 Wood Street. There are 
no special student rates.
Over Seventy 
Hopefuls Attend 
S&S Tryouts
Scotch and Soda’s first call to 
join the “line” was received with 
open arms by Tech students. A 
mixed chorus of at least seventy 
would-be dancers, representing 
all the various departments of the 
school made their appearance. 
Incidentally, many of the girls 
show promise of becoming future 
queens.
Everyone was excited over the 
superb music which assures a hit 
production. Foremost among the 
composers is Jerry Kurtz, who is 
back at school to graduate. He 
was formerly Libby Holman’s 
pianist. Other tunes that will set 
you humming were written by 
Gloria Siegle and Susie Miller, 
both of the Music Department.
Flash! Just released is the news 
that our dance director, Roland 
Kraus, has joined hands with the 
vivacious Audrey Botkin. Mr. 
Kraus has a long record and 
quite a bit of experience—now, 
now. He’s danced with Olsen and 
Johnson, Rudy Vallee, Edward 
Everett Horton, and in many bril­
liant revues. In fact, next sum­
mer he is going to be Dance Di­
rector at Cain Park Theatre in 
Cleveland Heights. With an in­
spiration like that, especially 
when teamed with the lovely 
Audrey, how can any of the dance 
routines miss?
And% finally, a reprieve for all 
you guilty ones who haven’t come 
out yet to do your bit. Further 
try-outs will be held soon. Watch 
for this call, which will probably 
be posted this week.
So whether it’s just for the 
chorus or whether you’re out to 
give Astaire and Rogers some 
competition, come out for the 
best production ever staged at 
Tech. "Here’s to,. You.”
Thistle Seeks Snapshots
Fraternities, sororities, organi­
zations, and individuals are all 
invited to submit as many snap­
shots as they like during the week 
of February 16. Pictures not 
used will be returned if the con­
tributor’s name is placed on' the

of Men.

sometime doring the run of this 
Play.
Helene Jafiln and Rose Marie 
Ellis are to play the lead at Tech. 
Helene is a Senior in the Drama 
Department and has had a great 
deal of experience in acting. She 
has played the lead in five plays 
—“Craig’s Wife,” “Daughter 6f 
Atreus,” “Lower Depths,” and 
“Stage Door” when she was in 
summer school. Besides all this 
she has played in summer stock 
and has been on the radio. Before 
coming to Carnegie Tech, she went 
to Columbia University for two 
years where she majored in Psy­
chology with minor dramatic sub­
jects, such as make-up and pub­
licity.
Rose Marie,- known as “Ten­
nessee,” comes from Nashville, 
Tennessee. As she is only a soph­
omore, she has not had as much 
experience as Helene. However, 
she played a very important char­
acter in “House of Connelly” and 
has participated in a summer mys­
tery series on the radio and in a 
southern program which was on 
two nation-wide hook-ups.
The play will run from Feb­
ruary 20 through February 27. 
As usual, there will be only one 
matinee to take place on the first 
Friday, the remainder of the per­
formances taking place in the 
evening. Tickets may be obtained 
on February 13 at Miss King’s 
office in Industries.
The biggest factor in making 
the play a success is the great 
admiration and respect of the 
cast for their director, Mr. Thomas 
Job. Aside from "Dawn in 
Lyonesse,” he has written "Bar- 
chester Towers,” “Uncle Harry,” 
and “Not to the Swift.” The last 
play was produced in England in 
January, 1940. This is exception­
al in that it is one of the few 
plays that has been produced there 
during this present war. It was 
directed by Sir Barry Jackson, a

“Dawn in Lyonesse,” the next 
play to be given in the Little 
Theater, has previously caused 
some talk on Broadway. Helen 
Hayes and Arline McMahon were 
quite interested in it; and the 
Olneys, New York producers, 
bought the rights to the play for 
Mildred Nutwick in October, 1940 
but later had to give up their 
option. A number of important 
persons, John Mason Brown—a

Last Saturday Tech’s Swim­
ming Team came through with a 
decisive victory over Kent State 
by a score of 55 to 20. This was 
an easy victory, as the Tartan 
mermen took first place in all but 
one event.
Allen Risedorph’s Plaids start­
ed early on their road to victory 
by winning the 300 yard medley 
relay. This event was swum by 
Martin, Vajda, and Carver. Their 
time was 3:39.4. The next event, 
the 220 yard freestyle, was taken 
by Tech’s Boehmig in a time of 
2:43.0. Boehmig led Turnock 
across the finish line to take first 
and second places. In the 50 yard 
free style, Molvie swam to victory 
with a time of 25.5 seconds. Again, 
Tech took both first and second 
places 3S Burtis followed Molvie

There were five optional dives 
per man, and from this it can be 
seen that Brown fell down on his 
optional dives. Had it not been for 
this, he probably would have ob­
tained a score close to that of 
Lewis. Johnson, of Kent State, 
' also did rather badly on his op­
tional dives.
Tech dropped the 100 yard free­
style to its opponents, due prim­
arily to the gruelling time of 
Wojino, but Molvie handed Tech 
a second place in this event. Mar­
tin finished first in the 150 yard 
backstroke, and Church of Tech 
came in third. Martin’s time was 
a good 2:03.2. The 200 yard breast 
stroke was won by the Skibos’ 
Cully in 3:04.5 minutes. Kent 
took both second and third places 
in this event. In the 440 yard 
freestyle Boehmig won in 5:50.4, 
barely squeezing out Wojino, who 
came in a close second. Turnock, 
by finishing third again gave Tech 
extra points in this event. Tech’s 
relay team (Bajda, Brown, Burtis, 
Carver) churned to a fast finish in 
the 400 yard relay with a time of 
4:13.3.

Two freak goals by Tom Soddy 
spelled defeat for the Tartan ice 
hockey squad last Monday night 
in their return match with the Pitt 
and Duquesne all-star team. In 
their former engagement with this 
aggregation of top-flight players 
from Pitt and Duquesne ice teams 
of former years, the Skibos em­
erged victorious by a 2-0 count.
The Scots drew first blood and 
went into a 1-0 lead when Benny 
Bergson scored, but when Soddy 
put the puck in the wrong goal 
accidentally, the count was knot- 
ed. A legitimate goal by the All- 
Stars raised the score to 2-1 in 
their favor, but the clincher came 
when Soddy again had the ill 
fortune to knock one past Goalie 
Fred Feiler for another All-Star 
• tally. The game was close and 
hard fought all the way, with the 
Tartans displaying the fine brand 
of hockey of which they are cap­
able.
Penn State will be the next op­
ponent of the Tech icers on Feb­
ruary 21, and negotiations are un­
der way for games with semi-pro 
teams from Akron and Charles­
ton.
Amateur Leagrue Plans Take Form
Plans for the formation of an 
amateur hockey league of local 
teams are rapidly assuming 
shape. Carnegie Tech will be the 
only college entry in the circuit, 
but many of the other squads will 
be represented by players with 
experience in inter-collegiate 
hockey.
The Tartans will play their local 
games at Duquesne Gardens, and 
are hoping for plenty of student 
support. If this league does be­
come a reality, they should get 
this support, because they are one 
of the few Carnegie Tech teams 
capable of turning in a healthy 
share of victories in this current 
ebb-tide of Skibo athletic fortunes.

Preps Riflemen 
For Season Ahead
Known to only a few of the stu­
dents is the fact that during the 
last few weeks, the Carnegie Tech 
Varsity and Freshman Rifle 
Teams have been organized and 
are going through a period of ex­
tensive practice. During the week 
of March 1, the Skibo marksmen 
will compete in the Third Corps 
Area R. O. T. C. Match, and on 
the week ending March 15, they 
will take active part in the an­
nual William Randolph Hearst 
Matches. Journeying to Annapolis 
on March 22, the Tartan gunners 
will match bullseyes with the 
Navy Plebes. During the same 
week the Rifle Team will shoot in 
the matches held by the Society 
of American Military Engineers. 
These matches are open only to 
Engineering units and are nation­
wide in their scope. It is a sig­
nificant fact, and a compliment to 
the able Sergeant Summer, that 
Carnegie Tech is the only engin­

Loss Number Ten
Whether it is caused by a lack of material, a lack of spirit, 
or a lack of interest in their chosen sport the Tartan hoopsters 
are still losing. This thing of chalking each and every ball game 
up as a loss has reached the red-faced embarrassment stage for 
many of the players on the team, and in addition to their recl- 
facedness the situation has boiled down until the aspect of sup­
porting a consistently losing team has become a sore spot to many 
of the young people making up young Carnegie. . Nevertheless, 
there seems to be no immediate solution to our problem nor does 
there seem to be much hope in the future for our cagers, for the 
simple reason that most of the teams appearing on the remainder 
of the schedule are putting in a repeat performance as Tartan 
opponents. Several of these combatants are: Westminster, Du- 
quesne, Pitt, West Virginia, and Penn State. There doesn’t seem 
.to be much in store for us from a standpoint of sporting amuse-; 
ment; the best we can hope for is a surprise win here or there.
The Old School Spirit
Many of the more or less ancient members of our school when 
putting in a return personal appearance usually recall with a 
great deal of pride the school spirit that was present on the cam­
pus during their four year term of school life. One of the con­
stant complaints put in by these oldsters is the present lack of the 
school spirit that was present when they attended our school. 
However, if these same gentlemen would take the time to attend 
one of the basketball games, staged in the gym this season they 
might alter their opinions to some extent.
The manner in which a portion of the Tech student body 
supports their basketball team is truly amazing. Each week at 
game time the Carnegie gym is always filled with some 500 Skibo 
rooters who cheer for each and every basket as if the outcome 
of the game depended upon its contribution to the total score. 
Notably among this group of red blooded enthusiasts is a' small 
but even growing contingent composed of dorm men who always 
occupy the .same section in the stands. This group of noise mak­
ers respond to every- basket with a whoop and a yell, and never 
fail to honor a man who is leaving the game with their own pri­
vate cheer that rolls out for almost a minute.
The only fault to be found is that the groups of this sort 
present at the games are few and far between. With the pres­
ence of a few more interested spectators and the regular appear­
ance of a Carnegie cheerleader, the outcome of some of the future 
basketball games may be radically changed. Let’s see if we (the 
students) can’t do our part to help out a fast faltering ball club.
Addition to Football Schedule
“Buddy” Overend, Graduate Manager of Carnegie Athletics, 
has just announced that the 1941 schedule for the football team 
has been completed with the addition of Albright college. Accord­
ing to present plans the game is to be played on the night of 
Friday, October 3, 1941, on the home field of our newest op­ponent.
The other teams played by our revamped and reorganized 
football squad are: Westminster, Delaware, Notre Dame, Geneva, 
Case, Cincinnati, and our time honored rival the University of 
Pittsburgh. A varied schedule isn’t it?

Skibo Losing Streak 
Grows to Ten Gaines
By JOE THOMAS
Carnegie Tech’s extended los­
ing streak was increased to ten 
in a row at Skibo gym last Sat­
urday night. The Covenantors 
from down Geneva way trampled 
the Tech hoopsters for the sec­
ond time this season to the tune 
of 47-32. The Tartans started the 
game like a whirlwind but the 
second half was the same old 
story, the opposing team forging 
ahead to win by a sizeable mar­
gin. The Tartan players were 
definitely oil after their three 
week layoff due to exams, in 
everything but fight. The boys 
never stopped trying but their 
shooting and ball handling were 
quite rus'ty and they were out­
classed for the evening by the 
boys from Beaver Falls.
Red Burch again led the local 
boys in points scored with a total 
of eleven, being followed by Brinn 
and Holets who had six each. For 
the Co vies, lanky Bill Jersey and 
Dick Hart scored 29 points beT 
tween themselves to help gain 
the victory, Jersey scoring sixteen 
of these, the majority being in the 
third quarter.
Starting for Tech were Brinn
ran
and Smith at forwards, Holets at 
center and Burch and Alexander 
at guards. At the start of the 
game, Burch went on a five-point 
•scoring spree and was followed 
by Brinn with a field goal, but in 
the meantime Geneva had scored 
ten points to make the score at 
the quarter 10-7. At the half Tech 
was in the lead 19-18 due to some 
fast breaking plays in which 
Hank Holets scored five and Iien- 
nessy tallied four. The third 
quarter was a see-saw affair with 
neither team rolling up any ap­
preciable lead, but the fourth pe­
riod saw the Covenantors pile up 
their decisive margin.
Early in the second period Herb 
Niederberger pulled the muscles 
in his knee and was out of the re­
mainder of the game. Red Burch 
also went out of the game in the 
fourth quarter but this was by 
the personal foul method. The 
Genevans put on-the “freeze act” 
at the end of the game and it was 
easy from there on in, although 
the Tech players never stopped 
trying. The second teams for both 
Tech and Geneva finished vout the 
contest but it made no appreci­
able change in the final score.

Leaders' Change, 
Bowling Starts, 
Volleyball New
Swinging into another big week 
of activity, the entire Intramural 
program continued its extensive 
schedule. It was an especially im­
portant week to those teams en­
tered in the Basketball League, 
for the top-position honors in the 
Interfraternity League changed 
places in a surprising manner. 
Heretofore undefeated, the strong 
D. U. team bowed its head in de­
feat to a hardworking and ruth­
less S. A. E. club. The teams were 
within only a few points of each 
other during the first half, but 
the third quarter showed the S.
A. E.’s in a scoring and defensive 
spurt that the D. U.’s could not 
overcome. During that quarter 
the winners scored nine points to 
their opponent’s three. The final 
score was 27-22. This victory had 
important reflections in the league 
standings. By virtue of winning 
all their games up to date the S. 
A.E.’s are now in indisputed first 
place, the D. U.’s dropping into 
a tie for second place with an up- 
and-struggling Kappa Sig team. 
Up to date the Kappa Sig’s have 
lost only one game, and that to 
the Du’s, and they have not played 
the present league leader. The 
independent league race has set­
tled down to watching how many 
points the Citcom Clan can pile 
up for the season. Due to a lack 
of interest, and probably in view 
of the fact that they had no chance 
to win the league trophy, the 
Electrical Engineers and Welch 
Hall dropped out of the basket­
ball contest. It is deplorable that 
these groups should not take ad­
vantage of the chance to have a 
little recreation and fun.
Last Saturday down in the new 
University Recreation Center on
4*»lf
Buddy Overend requests any­
one interested in trying out for 
the golf, team this Spring to 
leave his name at the Athletic 
Office sometime this week. The 
reason for this early request is 
that an attempt is being made to 
organize' both the Varsity and 
Freshman teams at an early date 
so as to provide for more frequent 
practice sessions. __________________

Nu Sigma Alpha 
Fraternity Joins 
Honorary Group
This Saturday evening, the 
associate groups composing the 
Interhonorary Council of Car­
negie Institute of Technology, will 
hold an open dance at Thistle Hall. 
This is the first big attempt the 
Council has made for such an 
affair and it is hoped that the 
success of the function will place 
it oh the permanent social calen­
dar of the campus at Carnegie. 
/Ml the evening students are ex­
tended an invitation to join in the
>p : Melp bring the party
ul termination. The 
'orlcing on the dance 
Will Good’s orches­
tra.
The holding of this party is to 
afford the students the opportunity 
of having an enjoyable evening 
and to secure funds to carry on 
the extensive program which is 
being mapped out by the Inter- 
honorary Fraternity Council. The 
assessment has been placed at 
$1.00 per couple and it is the de­
sire of the council that as many 
of the students as possible will 
attend.
The Interhonorary Fraternity 
Council was organized to further 
the interests of the entire student 
body of Carnegie Tech. Its pro­
gram is of such a varied nature 
that all groups are to receive 
benefits from its activities. Any 
assistance and help which the 
evening students can render will 
be appreciated by the Council.
The Interhonorary Fraternity 
Council is composed of Mortar 
;d and Blade, Sigma 
Tau Beta Pi, Phi 
i Tau Sigma, Eta 
Delta Epsilon, Phi 
Mu Alpha, Theta Tau, Tau Sigma 
Delta, Alpha Chi Alpha, and Nu 
Sigma Alpha.
Well, another week has rolled 
around and here wo are again, 
“scribblin’ ” about the people we 
lenow—same people, same things 
(our list of acquaintances is so 
•limited).
For those of you who have won­
dered at the deathlike silence on 
the campus this year, we’ll tell 
you. Seems that Bob Dickinson’s 
traveling around alone these days, 
and the rest of us gals are simply 
being ignored because of Marion 
•—¦(the gal from Florida). Gone 
forever, are the good old days 
when he would come tearing 
around the campus, closely fol­
lowed by six dozen blondes, all 
shrieking as blondes will. Now 
they just sit quietly sighing and 
knitting—like before the French 
Revolution —• we warned you. 
Imagine the fury of six dozen 
blondes scorned.
And speaking of knitting, you’ll 
be glad to hear that Sam the Hy­
draulics man, is driving around 
with, of all people, Mabel. Seems 
she dropped a stitch one night and 
looked up suddenly just in time 
to see the Plaid falling into the 
waste basket and there in bold, 
horrid type was the tale of Sam’s 
philandering. Seems he used to 
drive the two nicest girls at Tech 
to and from school every Tuesday 
and Thursday night. But, no 
more, now he drives only Mabel 
hither and thither, and the two 
nice girls made out all right, too. 
They now drive to and fro with 
another guy, a very distinctive 
number in fact, the only man at 
3 is Not talcing the De­
cree.
pe Mortimer C. Snerd 
..ill „...inue to feel that this is 
really the “piece de resistance” 
of the whole back page, and even 
of newspapers generally. We feel 
that if there were more guys like 
Mortimer spelling through more 
columns like this and less all 
wrapped up in some common 
sports page or. some silly finan­
cial section, things would be bet­
ter. Now don’t get riled and

Enrollment 
Bwindles For 
IVew Term
The Evening School Enrollment 
for the second semester has been 
sharply decreased. The enroll­
ment for the first semester con­
sisted of 3,059 students and the 
new enrollment, as of February 
5th, consists of 2,268, showing a 
decrease of 791. The decrease for 
the same period last year was 
from 2,946 to 2,546 students.
The Evening College of Indus­
tries showed the largest deficit, 
dropping from l,3o6 to 968 schol­
ars. The College of Engineering 
next, dropping from 1,168 to 913, 
Fine Arts from 469 to 344, while 
/Margaret Morrison College’s En­
rollment was cut from 86 to 43 
loyal students.
The registrar’s office claims that 
the drop in Enrollment was due 
. mainly to National Defense Works 
and to a great number expecting 
to be called in the draft.
How many Nite Students know 
that here at Tech, they have one 
of the finest, if not the finest type 
of student self-government in the 
country? This takes into consid­
eration the thousands of day 
school governments too. Some of 
you mpy know that, but very few 
of you appreciate it enough to 
come out and do the small amount 
of work necessary to make your­
self an integral part of this gov­
ernment. You are. entirely sat­
isfied to let a few “regulars” carry 
the burden of the disagreeable 
part of ' council work, while you 
sit back and enjoy the social 
events. I agree that the social 
events are for your pleasure, and 
without you they would not sat­
isfy their objective — a common 
meeting, and get acquainted place 
for all evening students—but I 
am not willing to agree with your 
attitude o£ “take all and do noth­
ing.”
Those splendid dances, ban­
quets, and elections are not pick­
ed out of the air. They are a re­
sult of weeks of work on the part 
of your council officers, who give 
freely of their time and services 
to guarantee your enjoyment.

Holiday Dance in Thistle Hall on 
Saturday, February 22nd from 9

man has secured “Buzz” Aston, ( 
one of the city’s better bands to

sonnel of your offices. At first I 
was stupid enough to think that 
there was a “clique” who control­
led the government. As a mat­
ter of fact I was stupid enough 
to put my thoughts into writing 
in my old Pen Points. After I • 
became more familiar with the 
set up here, I found out that it 
wasn’t the officers who were at 
fault, it was you students whom 
I thought I was defending. I found 
out that there were only a hand­
ful of you unselfish enough to 
come out and earn an Insignia 
Key and become eligible to hold 
office. I found out that although 
you were willing to promise to 
help at elections time, you soon 
lost heart and dropped out by 
mid-year.
Now I haven’t said this without 
a thought of giving you a chance 
to prove me wrong—you can still 
do that. There is still plenty of 
time to eax-n enough points for a 
key. All you have to do is come 
out to work before, during, or after 
the dances; make posters, and 
then when you’ve earned your key 
come back and make me eat my 
words. I assure you nothing 
would give me more pleasure.

The workers had ample oppor­
tunities to make points for their 
Insignia Awards. There were 
three working periods—one on 
Saturday afternoon, one on Sat­
urday evening, and a third - on 
Sunday afternoon, making it pos­
sible to earn six points in all.
The Officers of the Vocational 
School are Ed Tiepel, President; 
Stanley Stolarizyk, Vice President; 
Frank Carlos, Treasurer; and Miss 
Eleanor Gorskey, Secretary.

1939-40 TREASURER’S REPORT 
With Receipts and Disbursements through January 31, 1941.
They’re MILDER. Before auction time Chest­
erfield's expert tobacco buyers look over the 
growing crops so they will know firsthand whero 
the finest mild, ripe leaf is coming from. The 
way these tobaccos are conditioned, aged and 
blended gives Chesterfields a better taste and 
makes them definitely milder.
Valentino Greetings 
from ELLEN DREW, 
starring in the current 
Paramount hit "THE 
MAD DOCTOR"...and 
from CHESTERFIELD,

Do you know why Chest­
erfield gives you more pleasure? 
Because it’s the smoker’s cigarette 
. . . it has everything a smoker 
wants . . . Real Mildness and a 
Cooler, Better Taste.
Chesterfields are better-tasting and mild.. .not flat. ..not strong, because of their right combina­tion of the world’s best cigarette tobaccos. You can’t buy a better cigarette.
