ALLEfiHENY DOWNS TECHIN DUAL TRACK MEET
Interscholastic Contests Show Keen Competition—Schlopp 
of Jamestown High Does 11-8 in Pole VauJt
' Allegheny "Wins Over Techites ....7......nl....ohTafevhlimTa
Allegheny College defeated Carnegie Teeli in a dual track meet 
at Sclienley Oval Saturday afternoon. Allegheny outclassed Tech in 
•every event save four, which the Plaid took by large margins. In the 
idgh jump, broad jump and pole vault Tech scored eight times as 
'many points as Allegheny, while Allegheny did the same thing in the 
3.00-yard dash and in the 220 hurdles, and scored all the points in the 
120-yard hurdles. Allegheny held a distinct advantage in the shorter 
sprints, but Tech proved to have the greatest prowess on the longer 
' ones. Sachs of Tech broke the Tech record in the two-mile run, win­
ning easily by eight yards. Owing to an error by the officials the first 
two 100-yard dashes had to be repeated. The sprinters were started 
I -on the 10-yard line. McCreary and Crossman showed the greatest 
.ability of any of the Meadvillites, while Sachs was by far the star of 
' the Tech aggregation.
The interscholastic meet was won4----------------------------------------------------------------
by Shaw High School, of Cleveland.
The competition for the next three 
places was very keen, as only three 
iind one-half points separated the 
-fourth and second places. The leading 
participants in the meet were Sliaw 
High School with 37 points, Wilkins- 
burg High with 31% points, Erie High 
with 30 points, Washington High with 
'28 points, Schenley High with 23 
points, and Jamestown (N. Y.) High 
-with 22 points. Allewein, of Greens- 
burg, was the highest individual 
scorer, taking three first places, while 
McCreary, of Shaw High, was second 
with two first places. Summaries:

NEW TENNIS COURTS TO BE PLACED ALONG M.M.D.
Among other plans for beautifying 
the campus at the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology is the grading and lay­
ing out in tennis courts of the ravine 
adjoining the Margaret Morrison Div­
ision. Huge steam shovels are at 
work grading and terracing into the 
form of a bowl the excavation that 
was left upon the building of the 
Woman's School.
Tentative plans have been made for 
twelve courts in this sport,, which will 
be accessible to both the Tech team 
and the women's team from the Mar­
garet Morrison School.
The grading and terracing is but a 
part of the general clean-up plan 
adopted by the institution. Now, that 
the war is over and there is no longer 
any necessity for the maintenance of 
the barracks and military buildings 
that were erected during the progress 
of the war, every trace of the debris 
is to be removed, and according to 
schedule, the Tech campus is to he a 
model for College Campus beauty. The 
unsightly barracks that faced on 
Forbes street hav'- already been razed, 
and the stones and cinders carted 
away. A temporary roadway has been 
cut through and the lawn seeded. The 
lawns around the Central, Science and 
Industries buildings have been seeded 
and the first of the new grass is al­
ready peeping through the ground. 
With the exception o£ the School of 
Turbine Engineering, all the tempo­
rary war-time structures have been 
dismantled. The huge motor lorries 
have been converted to prosaic trucks, 
the Y hut will likely be turned into a 
library and Tech will take up in earn­
est the post-war program of Industrial 
Research.
Tech has laid aside the military ac­
couterments and once again put on 
civilian clothes and returned to a 
peace-time footing.
TENNIS TEAM BUCKLED UP AGAINST W. & J. MEN
The tennis team reached Washing­
ton, Pa., 'Wednesday morning, May 28, 
and were met at the train by the 
manager. The party consisted of 
Beatty, captain; Stocklager, Hark- 
ness, Code, Gothrop and Copley, Mana­
ger Nuttal and Colonel Brooks.
The players were distributed to dif­
ferent fraternities, where they were 
taken care of for lunch and later on 
for dinner. The play began about 2:30. 
The courts at Washington-Jefferson 
are far from good. The two best 
courts are covered with a loose sand 
gravel, causing out players to slip 
badly. The other two courts are 
partially grass-grown and caused pe­
culiar bounces to the balls. The 
courts ran east and west, one side 
having a distinct advantage from the
, sun. This was compensated for by iley (Wilkinsburg), second; Coffey tjie piayers changing courts in the odd

ANNUAL HAY DAY EXERCISES 
PRESENTED DY GIRLS OF M. It. D-
Under the green trees on the hill­
side, just behind the Mellon Hall, one 
of the most pleasing pageants of 
spring was produced. The annual 
May Day of Margaret Morrison this 
year equaled and even excelled those 
of former years. From the very first 
the Spirit of Spring was caught and 
held captive until the last notes of the 
evening hymn died away. The pro­
cession began promptly at half past 
four. It was led by Mary Truman, 
president of the Senior class. Aflter 
slowly leading the procession around 
the green knoll she reached her throne 
where she was crowned Queen of the 
May. Around her in a half circle the 
dancers in the procession sat await­
ing their turn to dance before their 
queen. Before the queen were then 
presented the dances. Each dance was 
announced by Tucket, Mary Ege.
The dance of the shepherds and 
maidens was presented by the class 
of 1921. This was followed by the 
Morris dance and the country dance. 
The May-pole was then wound by the 
plebe class. The jesters came next. 
They had been most energetically 
amusing themselves and the audience 
during the preceding dances. The 
jesters were followed by the dances of 
the seasons, brilliant summer, brown 
liued autumn, misty winter and bright 
spring. These were given by the 
classes of 1919 and 1920.
The festival ended with the singing 
of the evening hymn, pust as the sun 
was casting its hist long rays up 
through the hollow.
HIKING PLAYS PART IN M. M. D. ATHLETICS
A hike, held under the auspices of 
the Athletic Association, is being 
planned for this week. The day will 
depend upon the weather conditions. 
The route of the hike is also undeter­
mined. A number of girls, barred 
from basket ball and hockey, are 
planning to go in for hiking. Points 
of quality in athletics are given for 
hikes.
Plans for tennis are going slowly, 
as no courtB are yet available. The 
girls expected to be playing before 
this, but will make up for lost time 
when the courts are ready.
Miss Vivian Schmuclcer, '21, was 
elected secretary-treasurer of the Ath­
letic Association for the coining school 
year.

In the singles Beatty was placed

easily, 6 to 3, but in the second set 
relaxed a little bit and had consider­

As Gothrop was suffering from a

him in the single and played against 
Donaldson. This was Harkness' first

DESIGN STUDENTS FURNISH MUSIC AT M. M. D. ASSEMBLY
On Wednesday, May 26, one of the 
best assemblies of the year was held 
at M. M. A musical program was pre­
sented by a group of students from 
the Design School. The selections 
were well rendered and were enjoyed 
by all. The program was:
1. Allegro from Piano Quartet, G
Minor.................................................Mozart
Alice Kirk, Francis Kleyle 
Adolph Herzberg, Jean Wessner.
2. Andante cantabile from String
Quartet................................... Beethoven
<3.-Cello Solo.

Jean Wessner; 
Accompanist, Helen Eshelman.
4. Allegro brillante . from Piano
Quintet....................................... Schuman
Isabel Palmer, Francis Kleyle, 
Dorothy Manor, Adolph Herz­
berg, Jean Wessner.
One of the new movements that 
iitt'Ai been started at the Carnegie In­
stitute recently Is the formation of 
“Home Town Clubs.” These clubs are 
the result of a number of students who 
all hail from the same town and, hav­
ing the same local interests at heart, 
have banded together. They hold 
meetings at regular intervals and havo 
elected officers for the various clubs, 
and, the movemont having startod, is 
spreading like wild-firo at Tech, and 
every hamlet In the country having 
more than one student at Tech will bo 
represented by a club.
The pioneer of the movomont is 
Samuel B. Shearer of Zanesville, O., 
and through his efforts, not only has a 
club from his home town, tlie Zanes­
ville Club, been formed, but he has 
been instrumental in seeing the movel 
ment take root in other communities. 
Shearer is a Sophomore in the Heat­
ing and Ventilating Division at 
Tech, and is also president of the B. 
T. U: Club of the Industries School. 
He is the son of S. W. Shearer, 520 
Fulton street, Zanesville, O. Be­
fore entering Tech ‘Sam” was in busi­
ness with his father, and has come to 
Tech to make an intensive study of

TRACK MEN STRIVE TO BREAK TECH RECORDS
One of the greatest Improvements in 
the track work at Tech is noticeable in 
the running of Sacks, the best of the 
Tech middle and long distance run­
ners. This boy trotted the half in 
2:03 flat at Tech oval, and is improv­
ing so rapidly that he may break the 
Tech record before school closes. This 
time was made on a track that was 
still wet from the continued rains of 
the past few days and extremely 
heavy.
The same improvement is showing 
all through the squad. Stults is clear­
ing 10 feet 6 inches regularly in the 
pole vault and Smith is making 5 
feet 7 inches in the high jump. David­
son and Hamman, the “Martinsburg 
Wonder,” are getting from 20 feet 3 
inches to 20 feet 6 inches in the broad 
jump. Davidson would be one of the 
best sprint men in Tech if he had a 
sound heart. This fellow did the 100 
in 10 1-5, while in high school, but has 
had to quit this branch of track 
athletics, owing to the heart trouble. 
Gare, who was shifted from the half- 
mile to the hurdles, has proven a real 
find and is showing remarkable speed 
on these jumps. lie recovers rapidly 
in.the leap and lands running at full 
speed. This man may also be shifted 
to the broad jump and noxt year will 
likely be one or Tech’s mainstays in 
track athletics.
PENN STATE BASEBALL GAME WILL BE TEST
As a result of the last few days of 
baseball a general shakoup QI expectod 
on the Tech Varsity. With Weiss, 
Lusby, Doherty, Levine and oLhers 
down in their studies, the team has 
done remarkably well considering the 
lineup they havo presented. Especially 
has the pitching staff been hit; by the 
deficiencies', Weiss, who stopped the 
Lebanon Valley team. Lusby, the mid­

the rigid scholastic requirements.

MUSKINGUM DEFEATS TECH; SCORE 6-5
The Kiltie ball tossers took another 
hard whipping on Tech diamond 
yesterday to the tune of 6 to 5. After 
holding the Muskingum ball team 
without a run for seven innings, Weiss 
the Tech cub pitcher, blew up in the 
seventh and five Muskingum baseball 
sharp-shooters romped across the pan. 
Tech, in the first inning, had accumu­
lated three runs, and was sailing along 
confidently on this margin. Following 
the batting bee of the fateful seventh, 
Tech gathered in two more runs in 
the second half of the seventh, and tied 
the score. Captain Gretzler was sent 
in by Honus to replace Weiss, but the 
Muskingumites were not to be denied, 
and in the ninth inning collected the 
winning run and the game. Tech 
played good baseball, and only the 
fact that Weisfc had been kept out of 
the game for some time, on account 
of scholastic requirements, and was 
not able to stand fche gaff accounted 
for dropping the game. Again an op­
ponent has met Tech, with a fair team 
and a pocketful of horse shoes, with 
the result of another tough loss for

Captain Gretzler again worked on the

Gretz and Gates getting three apiece.

TENNIS TEAM HAS SHOWN GOOD 
RECORD SO FAR THIS SEASON
One of the sports that has not been 
given the prominence it should re­
ceive at Tech is the good, old sum­
mer game of tennis. This sport has 
been rather overshadowed by base­
ball and track athletics. However, 
Tech has a team that so far in the 
year has an unblemished record. It 
has already defeated Pitt, (nearly a 
whitewash) and broken even with the 
fast players from Washington and 
Jefferson.
This team is under the coaching of 
Colonel John C. W Brooks, head of 
the Military Department at Tech. 
Colonel Brooks is an old army player 
of prominence. In his prime he met 
the best of the players throughout the 
country, and today Is on intimate 
terms with the various champions. In 
spite of his 30 years’ army service he 
is a fast player, and seenm to have 
the knack of teaching the Tech boys 
to play the same game he did.
The captain of the team is John 
David Beatty, who Is a Senior, and 
leaves Tech this year. Beatty In the 
mainstay of the Tech team, on ac­
count of his experience and Ills win­
ning the single from Donaldson in the 
W. & J. game, tied the score. Pe- 
puliarly enough, Beatty v/as the only 
Tech man In the W. & J. game to win 
a single set, and the only Tech man 
.who lost a .single in..the Pitt match,

Was it a “cullud” man to wash the 
windows who wandered ’round the 
rumpus lant Thursday or was It a.oftiu 
nlbal from Darkest Africa? Maybe II; 
was a dangerous “Injun,” In all Ills 
war paint, fresh from the massacro of.
I ho Innocont women and children In 
a frontier cabin? Well, you havo had 
Ihroo guesses, all of which woro 
wrong. It was merely an Inslgnlllcant 
but unruly Plebe who was sufficiently 
naughty to merit dlro punlshmont. 
Time after time ho had dlsoboyod I ho 
small details of the regulations until 
all those misdemeanors came to a 
hair-cutting total. It was doomed 
necessary to mote out the Just re­
ward.
Just before the naughty Plobo's 
class was out about 10 Sophs, sworn 
In as deputies by the Plobo regula­
tions committee, gathered In the cor­
ridor of Science building and waylaid 
said Plobo 011 the way out. He was 
carolossly yanked Into Room III, and 
was told that I10 was about to reeolve 
the punishment that, he so Justly 
merited. He arrogantly asked by what 
authority I10 was mistreated In such a 
foul manner, and wus told, that, after 
the artistic work was completed, ho 
would be permitted to see Mills, the 
chairman of the Plobo Regulations 
Committee; I-Ils captors then sat him 
on the floor and, without further cere­
monies, produced a pair of clippers 
and a box of shoe polish. One dexter­
ous Sophomore cut Ills hair in a mosr, 
artistic and original manner. It was 
cut off at both sides and a strip was 
left down the middle of his head, 
which made him look most unique. 
Another Soph laid a lovely coating of 
shoe polish, leaving only his eyes and 
mouth exposed. Many suggestions 
were made by the audience, the best 
of which were carried out. For in­
stance, a black wound stripe was 
painted on his right arm. The Plebo 
seemed to consider himself very much 
wronged because last year, when he 
attended another school, they made 
him chop a neat hole in the ice and 
jump in. Since he is at Tech now, wo 
deduce that they neglected to drown 
him. He was told to keep his dis­
guise on all day, and not to wear a 
hat, so that he would be an example 
to other Plebes, and was then kicked 
out into the hot, hot world (99 degrees 
in the shade). Craving sympathy he 
paraded past M. M., and only suc­
ceeded in being laughed at.
The victim thinks that he has got­
ten all that Is coming to him, and Is 
beginning to become arrogant; once 
more. However, the Plebe Conduct 
Committee visited the “Success” a few 
days ago, and have lots of new Ideas 
on the subject of punlshmont, which 
will not be liked by any who run

The Tartan is now under the direction of student activities and 
insignia will be given to members oii the staff. Last week there 
was about five articles handed in by the entire staff, leaving the 
editors the burden of writing the balance.
This is the point, then. Every week, every member of the staff 
hand in some article, signed. This must be done if you wish to 
hold your place on the staff.
A TAINTED FIRST
No doubt Allegheny College feels big over its first place in the 
shot put. Any way it ought to, for Ellerton had but three trials and 
no chance to warm up. On the fourth trial lie heaved the weight 
over a foot further than the man who won it.
Certainly the coach from there feels good. He ought to; a little 
college spirit would have convinced us Jliat he was a fairer and more 
level-headed coach.
A BOOK EXCHANGE
There has been some question as to the advisability oj: a book 
exchange. Various members of the faculty advise students to keep
dering of money, certainly ought not to be encouraged.
Too bad the contemptible ‘‘shimmy’’ wasn’t in vogue for him to j 
take a rap at also. But anyway, there are students, many of them, 
who are seriously valuing the opportunity to pursue a college course. 
But these arc not the popular ones. Why?

The manager of the team is also a

M. M. IDEA OF THE "PUPPET”
No one had better ask any Margaret Morrison' girl for her 
opinion ol! the Puppet.” A great deal of pleasure in the‘book was 
spoiled for her by the supposedly humorous drawing adorning the 
middle page of the book. It certainly was a rather far fetched idea 
of humor that fostered that pseudo-cartoon, and wo arc very proud 
to say that it is not a brand of humor that can be appreciated by 
any M. M. girl. If the (censored) prefers shown (censored) picture, 
is representative of the rest of Tech, M. M.’s are certainly glad they 
are not considered up to her standard.
Aside from what has been given, there is another deeper 
feeling in Margaret Morrison. Although we know that we have no 
desire to imitate the model held up to .Us, we are hurt that, after all 
HVe have done for Tech not only this year but in past years, we would 
Ve,held up to ridicule in a magazine published by our fellow students. 
"What has been done in school this year that all Tech hasn’t acknowl­
edged M. M. was the force that put it over? Look at the Liberty 
Loans, clean-up day. What one of these 01* of numberless other af­
fairs "would have been as great a success without M. M. ? If any­
thing is to be done it is always to M. M. that you come. But if such 
little appreciation is shown, why should M. M. do their part if she 
be deemed worthy only of ridicule? But what M. M. has done she 
will continue to do for Tech, not for unappreciative fellow students, 
who are quite free to look elsewhere for their ideals and avIio truly 
lieed not look for them around M. M. for a long time.
SALT
“Sail,” although a queer title for a book, serves its purpose, as 
treated by Charles O. Norris. In it he attacks the mental attitude, 
standards and point ol! view of students in colleges and preparatory 
schools.
The author says: “I was taught to lie and cheat by every one 1 
knew and even persuaded to hand over my fraternity pledge pin in 
order to join another fraternity.” lie continues the indictment by 
this strong statement, “Our universities are making thousands of 
loose-principled men, year after year, and turning them out all over 
the country.J ’
Every student who reads this book realizes there is much truth 
in what the author says about our universities. "While we believe his 
statements are a little wild in some cases, we must admit the craze 
of some students for social success, daueiug aud the iuordinate squan-
The Story of Your Study LampI
F you were studying by an old smoky oil lamp and suddenly a 
modem, sun-like inAen lamp were thrust into the room, the contrast 
would be dazzling. That instant would unfold the result of thirty 
years’ development, research and manufacturing in electric lighting.
EDISON'S
FIRST
LAMP
And this development commenced with 
Edison’s first lamp—hand-made, when 
electricity was rare.
The General Electric Company was a 
pioneer in foreseeing the possibilities of 
Edison’s invention. Electric generators 
were developed. Extensive experiments 
led to the design and construction of 
apparatus which would obtain electric 
current from far-away waterfalls and 
deliver it to every city home.
With power lines well distributed over 
the country, the use of electric lighting 
extended. Street lighting developed from
the flickering arc to the great white way. 
Electric signs and floodlights made our 
cities brilliant at night, searchlights 
turned night into day at sea, and minia­
ture lamps were produced for the 
miner’s headlight and automobile.
While the making of the electrical indus­
try, with its many, many interests, was 
developing, the General Electric Com­
pany’s laboratories continued to improve 
the incandescent lamp, and manufacturing 
and distributing facilities were provided, 
so that anyone today can buy a lamp 
which is three times as efficient as the 
lamp of a few years age.

Miss Mary B. Breed, dean of the 
Margaret Morrison division, left on 
Saturday evening for Bryn Mawr. She 
attended the twenty-fifth annual re­
union of the class of 1894, of which 
she is a member.
An offer of a technical education in 
Sweden, under tha guidance of some 
of the noted authorities of that coun­
try, is tendered in a letter received by 
President Arthur A. I-Iamerschlag. 
The letter comes from the American 
Scandinavian Foundation, 25 West 
Forty-fifth street, New York City, and 
offers 10 fellowships for technological 
study in the land of the midnight sun. 
The definition of the subjects is not 
strictly limited, but it is the hope of 
the Foundation to apply the fellow­
ships to study in these courses to 
which Swedish science offers unusual 
advantages, such as Physics and 
Chemistry, Hydro-Electrical Engineer, 
ing, Metallurgy, Forestry and Lum­
bering. Applicants between 20 and 30 
years and graduates of some American 
technical school are preferred. Each 
fellowship is for one academic year, 
and provides $1,000.

The Margaret Morrison League 
Club that was organized in connection 
with the “girl farmerettes” movement 
of the Carnegie Institute'of Technol­
ogy held a ‘‘swimming party” last 
week at the Schenley High School 
natatorium.
On Thursday evening this club will 
hold an informal dance in the Recrea­
tion Hall of the Margaret Morrison 
Division for the members and their 
friends. This club was organized by 
Miss Margaret Spilman, in connection 
with the program of the Council of 
National Defense, which urged that 
all educational institutions recruit the 
man power for the purpose of raising 
the much needed crops of the coun­
try. Already over 300 girls have been 
enrolled in this, the only unit of farm 
workers in Pittsburgh or vicinity. In 
a short time they will leave for Camp 
Louise Carnegie at Gelncairn on the 
Allegheny to take up their duties for 
the season. While in camp the. girls 
will live n a huge old rambling struc­
ture called the Mansion House. Many 
of the “farmerettes" are already in 
camp, where they will remain until 
fall. Week-end trips are being sched­
uled by Miss Spilman, the director of 
the camp. No farm work will be done 
by the week-end visitors. Registration 
for the week-end trips may be made to 
Miss Margaret Spilman at 510 Bes­
