Laverne Cox, transgender 
activist and Emmy-nominated 
actress of Orange is the New 
Black, spoke to a packed crowd 
at Carnegie Mellon’s Wiegand 
Gymnasium last Thursday. 
Her speech was jointly spon-
sored by the Activities Board, 
CMU Allies, Residential Edu-
cation, the Carnegie Mellon 
School of Drama, Student 
Dormitory Council, Student 
Senate, and the Graduate Stu-
dent Assembly. Tickets were 
free for Carnegie Mellon fac-
ulty, staff, and students, and  a 
limited number were released 
to the general public for $15.
Cox opened her hour-
long speech by claiming 
her identity as a “proud 
African-American transgen-
der woman” to enthusiastic 
cheers from the audience. 
She thanked the audience for 
their support, which after a 
challenging week she found 
“deeply healing.” The audi-
ence laughed and cheered en-
thusiastically at several points 
throughout the speech.
Cox told her personal story 
of growth, from her child-
hood in Alabama to her ado-
lescence at dance school to 
her burgeoning womanhood 
in New York City. Her speech 
was full of anecdotes and life 
lessons. She discussed the 
rampant bullying and shame 
she suffered as a child, from 
students who policed her 
gender expression with ho-
mophobic slurs to a third-
grade teacher who warned 
her mother that, without im-
mediate therapy, “your son 
is going to end up in New 
Orleans in a dress.”
Cox also talked about how 
the vibrant New York drag 
queen and trans community 
helped provide her with the 
courage to transition. “Trans 
was not associated with suc-
cessful and accomplished, 
and I was groomed to be a 
successful and accomplished 
young person,” Cox said about 
her ?rst exposure to the com-
munity. “We have misconcep-
tions about people who are 
different but when we just 
need to get to know those peo-
ple as people, all those mis-
conceptions will melt away.”
Cox made multiple 
references to famous femi-
nist writings that have in?u-
enced and inspired her, such 
as Sojourner Truth’s “Ain’t I a 
Woman” speech about black 
womanhood, Simone de 
Beauvoir’s work on gender as 
a social construct, and Judith 
Butler’s theory that gender 
identity is performed. “One 
is not born a woman, one be-
comes one,” Cox quoted from 
Butler’s Gender Trouble. “No-
where is it guaranteed that 
the one who becomes a wom-
an is necessarily female,” she 
quoted from de Beauvoir.

Dining

Dining Services has recently announced two new search features on 
the Dining Services website which will allow students and community 
members to more easily search for soups and daily specials offered at 
dining locations throughout Carnegie Mellon.
The new Today’s Soups feature allows users to see what soups are 
offered at locations such as Au Bon Pain and the Underground. Choices 
may range from chicken noodle soup to corn chowder or broccoli and 
cheddar. Similarly, the new Today’s Specials feature allows users to 
see specials that are being served at locations such as Au Bon Pain, the 
Underground, and the Exchange. Choices may range from turkey swiss 
BLT to the “PACO” sandwich or a buffalo shrimp wrap.
This addition was ?rst sought after Dining Services’ Advisory 
Council reported that they would love to have a more organized way 
of knowing specials and soups that are being offered across campus on 
any particular day.
Mandi Semple, the director of marketing for student affairs 
operations, stated that a Facebook post on To Dining with Love, which is 
run by Carnegie Mellon students, also stated that students would love to 
have a soup Twitter account where students could see what soups were 
being offered across campus. A lot of students responded favorably to 
this suggestion and stated that they would love to see something like 
this be offered. “I kept that in the back of my mind as we were building 
this new feature,” Semple said. While this new feature isn’t connected to 
Twitter, it is a place online where the community can be better informed 
about their dining options.
Why the speci?c focus on soups, you may ask? Semple has noticed 
that this is a soup heavy campus where people talk about soup a lot, 
especially students who are interested in vegan and vegetarian soup 
options. “That’s been something that we hear a lot from students who 
want to know what those options are.” She also adds that for cold 
Pittsburgh days, soup is one comfort food that a lot of community 
members tend to reach for.
“Our goal with our website and everything we do is to continue to 
?nd ways to enhance the dining experience for students and commu-
nity members on campus when we hear requests such as this,” Semple 
said. Dining Services is aware that Carnegie Mellon’s dining program is 
unique since there isn’t one dining hall where all food options are right 
in one place. “Food options are spaced out all across campus,” Semple 
said. “If we can ?nd a way to help students make better choices before 
they venture out, maybe they’ll ?nd something new and different that 
they like.”
The new soup and daily specials features add to Dining Services’ goal 
of communicating more effectively with students while also creating a 
fresh new design that blends in with the new cmu.edu website.
Community members may have noticed that, in the previous system, 
times for dining locations were listed but required new updates depend-
ing on special circumstances such as holidays. As a solution, Semple 
says that dining services updated the website so that it now has “one 
data entry portal where we could put in special hours.” Hours are put 
in one place so that the site has a live update of places that are open or 
closed, not just listed times. Adding the new soup and daily specials fea-
tures is just another way Dining Services is striving to make the dining 
experience at Carnegie Mellon easy and enjoyable.
“Dining is always striving to enhance the dining experience on cam-
pus for students, faculty, and staff. We hope these two new features will 
be ones that can serve you on a daily basis,” Dining Services stated in a 
press release.

Italy rescues over 2,000 migrants off the Libyan coast
INTERNATIONAL NEWS IN BRIEF
Turks plan to vote on expandingErdogan’s power
ANKARA — Turkish 
opinion polls show that 
there is a narrow lead for 
a “yes” vote to replace 
Turkey’s parliamentary 
democracy with an all-
powerful presidency. This 
would mean that President 
Tayyip Erdogan could re-
main in of?ce until at least 
2029, which would create 
a radical change to Turkey’s 
political system.
Around 55 million 
people were eligible to 
vote at 167,140 polling sta-
tions across the nation on 
Sunday. 
Erdogan and his 
supporters say the changes 
are needed to amend the 
current constitution and to 
avoid the fragile coalition 
governments the country 
has faced in the past. Op-
ponents say this would 
lead to an authoritarian 
government.
North Korea shows off deadly missiles at military parade
PYONGYANG — On the 
105th birth anniversary 
of North Korea’s founding 
father, Kim Il Sung, North 
Korea displayed new long-
range and submarine-based 
missiles at the event’s military 
parade.
North Korea has conducted 
several missile tests and 
has regularly threatened to 
destroy the United States. 
This missile display occurred 
several days after America’s 
recent attack on a Syrian 
air?eld, which has raised 
questions about Donald 
Trump’s plans for North 
Korea.
Of?cials believe that North 
Korea is some time away from 
mastering all the necessary 
technology to launch a missile 
that can strike the United 
States.
ROME — Italian rescue 
ships have rescued over 
2,000 migrants from smug-
glers’ boats off the coast of 
Libya. This past weekend, 
one rescue ship brought 504 
migrants to Pozzallo, Sicily, 
while another brought 500 
other migrants to Augusta, 
Sicily. 
This year, around 29,000 
migrants have arrived in 
Italy after being rescued by 
European military ships or 
private charity organiza-
tions. Most of these immi-
grants were reported to be 
?eeing poverty in sub-Saha-
ran Africa. Their numbers 
are expected to rise due to 
the warmer weather.
U.S. bomb death toll in Afghanistan rises to 94 people
KABUL — The number of 
militants killed in Thursday’s 
attack by the largest non-
nuclear weapon ever used in 
combat by the U.S. military 
has risen to 94.
The U.S. attack on a 
tunnel complex in  Nangarhar 
killed at least four IS group 
leaders. “Fortunately there 
is no report of civilians being 
killed in the attack,” Ataullah 
Khogyani, spokesman for 
the provincial governor in 
Nangarhar, said.
Former Afghan president 
Hamid Karzai criticized 
both the Afghan and U.S. 
governments for the attack, 
saying that allowing the U.S. 
to carry out the bombing 
was an insult to Afghanistan. 
Current President Ashraf 
Ghani’s of?ce said that 
there was close coordination 
between the U.S. military 
and the Afghan government 
on the operation.

EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
Recently, Congress has 
been on its April recess ses-
sion, so many congressmen 
are holding town halls in their 
home states to take ques-
tions and hear concerns from 
their constituents. Bob Casey, 
the Democratic senator from 
Pennsylvania, was no excep-
tion. He has held a series of 
town halls in various loca-
tions in the state, including 
one last week at University of 
Pittsburgh’s Alumni Hall.
The town hall focused on 
three major themes — health-
care policy, environmental pol-
lution concerns, and American 
involvement in Syria. Many 
voters were concerned about 
these issues and had strong 
feelings about them, which 
was evident by the number of 
questions about these topics.
One environmental concern 
that was brought up several 
times during the town hall 
was fracking. Casey supports 
fracking since he believes it 
creates jobs, is relatively clean 
(a thought which was met with 
many disagreeing signs), and 
enhances our national security 
by lessening our dependence 
on Middle Eastern oil. While 
he does believe that there 
should be regulations con-
cerning the right of local resi-
dents to know what chemicals 
are used in fracking and that 
fracking must be consistent 
with state and federal rules, 
many attendees disagreed 
and thought that it would be 
better for Pennsylvania to end 
fracking for good.
There was a woman who 
told a story about how her 
health has spiraled downhill 
because of environmental 
pollution and how she is now 
concerned for her grandchil-
dren. Casey thanked her for 
telling her story and said that 
we must hold parties account-
able for pollution and intro-
duce a budget to account for 
environmental issues — the 
Trump budget does not pro-
vide this. He mentioned that 
citizens concerned about the 
environment should support 
the Clean Power Plan and the 
overturning of the Citizens 
United case to lessen the in?u-
ence of dark money in politics. 
He invited anyone with ideas 
to submit plans for an energy 
proposal that would be better 
than the current one. Through-
out the town hall, he reiterated 
the theme of being vigilant 
and ?ghting back against the 
harmful policies that the far 
right has espoused.
Healthcare was another 
major theme, given that 
the GOP bill to overturn the 
Affordable Care Act (ACA) re-
cently failed. Casey suggested 
that many Democrats got a 
false sense of security when 
the GOP bill failed, and re-
minded the attendees that the 
GOP has done nothing to ac-
tually improve the healthcare 
system. He reminded people 
that it was necessary to call 
out the GOP’s efforts to de-
fund Planned Parenthood and 
turn Medicare into a voucher 
program, which he said was 
the fastest way to destroy 
Medicare, which many rural 
Pennsylvanians use. Casey 
also mentioned the ACA’s suc-
cesses in increasing coverage 
rates, prohibiting the denial of 
coverage based on pre-existing 
conditions, and prohibiting 
gender-based discrimination. 
In response to an attendee 
questioning him about why 
he doesn’t support Medicare 
for all, he mentioned a bill 
he and Bernie Sanders were 
co-sponsoring that would al-
low the importing of cheaper 
medicines from Canada, and 
said there should be a public 
option for Medicare.
The issue that seemed to 
divide the room was Syria. 
Casey said that while he be-
lieved President Trump’s strike 
on Assad’s military bases was 
an appropriate response to the 
horror of the chemical attack, 
the president must have a 
longer-term plan for the fu-
ture of Syria that should not 
include ground troops. How-
ever, many in the room were 
fed up with U.S. intervention 
in the Middle East and saw 
it as yet another one of the 
mistakes Americans made 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, and 
thus disagreed with Casey’s 
position. Several protesters 
went through the room hold-
ing signs and chanting “No 
more war.” Casey did reiterate 
several times throughout the 
town hall, however, that there 
must be a debate in Congress 
over the use of military force 
on foreign countries, which he 
believed has been inappropri-
ately lessened during both the 
current administration and the 
Obama administration.
There were a few questions 
relating to the peculiarities of 
the Trump administration as 
well. One voter expressed her 
concerns about the high costs 
of taxpayer-funded presiden-
tial security. This question 
resonated with a lot of the 
other attendees, as a wave 
of agree signs went up at the 
mention of these security costs. 
Casey responded by saying 
that while a president and his 
family are by law guaranteed 
Secret Service protection, he 
hoped that the administration 
would reexamine its budget 
priorities and not cut essential 
programs and services in the 
name of security.
Another question that 
drew applause was asked by 
a young girl, who was upset 
about the fact that President 
Trump wants to shut America’s 
door on Syrian refugees. Casey 
agreed with the girl’s words. 
He said that barring Syrian 
refugees does not make us any 
safer, and that it was unfair 
that people who had already 
undergone an extensive vet-
ting process were suddenly 
being turned away.
In regards to the Rus-
sian investigation, Casey 
commanded the Republican 
senators who were making a 
serious effort at investigating 
any possible ties between 
Trump and Russia. He said he 
wishes that Trump would put 
out a statement saying that 
Russia must not interfere in 
our elections again, no matter 
whom they are trying to help.
There were also some 
concerns about how the 
Democratic Party would fare 
in future elections and about 
the lack of a strong central 
message from the party. Casey 
agreed, saying that the party 
has needed a stronger central 
message for a while as it moved 
away from the main economic 
and jobs focused message from 
several years ago. However, he 
emphasized the importance 
of stopping the most extreme 
parts of the GOP agenda from 
going forward in addition to 
creating this message.
Casey discusses pollution, healthcare, and America’s involvement in Syria at town hall
Cox’s speech was how the 
intersections of her identity — 
race, gender, and class — have 
deeply shaped her experience. 
She spoke out against the “de-
valuation of black woman-
hood,” the disproportionate 
rates of suicide and violence 
against trans women of color, 
and the violence inherent in 
misgendering a trans person. 
She also spoke of the need 
for minority solidarity rather 
than in?ghting.
“Often marginalized 
people will police each other,” 
said Cox. “That is the tool of 
the oppressor.”
She stressed the 
importance of supporting 
trans rights, especially in 
the current political climate, 
where transgender and gen-
der non-conforming people 
are “deeply shamed, stigma-
tized, criminalized, and objec-
ti?ed.” She spoke of the need 
to ?ght back with love against 
discriminatory bathroom bills 
and Trump’s rescinding of 
Obama-era federal guidelines 
for the fair treatment of 
transgender students in 
schools, as well as to ?ght for 
the right of LGBTQ persons to 
be included in a federal cen-
sus. “Justice is what love looks 
like in public,” Cox said. “We 
just want to be counted.”
Cox closed her speech with 
a call to action, stating that we 
need to “create safe spaces to 
have dif?cult conversations 
across differences” guided by 
“love and empathy,” where 
people don’t have to be afraid 
of saying the wrong thing.
Cox’s speech was followed 
by a 20-minute question 
and answer session with 
the audience. One audience 
member asked her about Or-
ange is the New Black, which 
she said “opened so many 
doors for me and I’m so grate-
ful.” When asked about her 
future goals, Cox said: “I want 
to expand my brand... I want 
to be a better businesswom-
an, and I want to have more 
control.” As she exited the 
stage, Cox waved to thunder-
ous applause and a standing 
ovation.

On Thursday, April 13, it 
?nally happened. The new 
Chipotle Mexican Grill opened 
on Forbes Avenue next to Craig 
Street. After months of watch-
ing the construction, the stu-
dents of Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity now have a Chipotle 
restaurant all to themselves 
(of course students of other 
colleges are always welcome).
Chipotle is one of the most 
popular restaurants in the 
country. There are three restau-
rants in the areas surrounding 
campus: on Forbes Avenue in 
Oakland near the University of 
Pittsburgh’s campus, on Baum 
Boulevard in Shadyside, and 
on Centre Avenue in East Lib-
erty. For many Carnegie Mellon 
students, the closeness of the 
new restaurant to our campus 
is a big factor in the excitement. 
“I go to the Chipotle near At-
wood a lot because it’s got good 
food,” ?rst-year Jeremy Ong 
said. “I’m excited about it being 
closeby because then I won’t 
have to walk as far.”
The interior of the 
restaurant is quite narrow, with 
only enough space for the line 
and serving area. There are two 
small tables near the entrance 
with limited seating in an up-
stairs loft. Because it is usually 
busy, it is hard to ?nd seating, 
and most customers have to 
get their food to go. For many 
students, however, getting food 
to-go is their intention.
“It was really nice,” ?rst-
year Matt Spettel said. “The 
line was almost out the door, 
but the line moved extremely 
quickly and the staff was nice, 
and they could tell that many 
people were in a rush because 
this is Carnegie Mellon. I ap-
preciated that.” Spettel also 
expressed interest in poten-
tially being able to use DineX at 
Chipotle. The Carnegie Mellon 
Undergraduate Student Senate 
has a petition on change.org to 
add Chipotle as a DineX loca-
tion in addition to Eat’n Park, 
Eat Unique, Quiznos, Subway, 
and Vocelli Pizza.
At the time of writing, the 
petition, which was started on 
the restaurant’s opening day, 
has already amassed 465 signa-
tures in support. Only 35 more 
students are needed to reach 
its goal of 500 signatures. Stu-
dents’ reasons for signing in-
clude the wish for more options 
to use DineX, especially for 
those who ?nish the semester 
with a lot left over in their ac-
counts. There is also an inter-
est in diversifying Carnegie 
Mellon’s meal plan, and all 
students who signed the peti-
tion emphasized their love for 
Chipotle and how the use of 
DineX would be a great incen-
tive to eat there more. “That 
would be an absolute game 
changer,” ?rst-year Sarina 
Stein said on potentially using 
DineX at Chipotle. “I would eat 
there a lot.”

Congress threatens important net neutrality with bill
A few weeks ago, Congress 
passed a bill allowing internet ser-
vice providers (ISPs) to sell their us-
ers’ browsing history without the us-
ers’ permission. Currently, the only 
hurdle the bill has left to overcome 
is a signature by President Donald 
Trump, who seems to be against net 
neutrality, the principle that ISPs 
should provide equal access to all 
services and website, regardless of 
source.
The Republican majority 
Congress voted to deny a privacy law 
the Obama administration passed 
in its ?nal days. Under that law, the 
Federal Communication Commission 
(FCC) would have required ISPs to 
ask their users before sharing their 
browsing history. Furthermore, ISPs 
would have been required to alert 
users of a hacking breach. All these 
precautions are under attack now, 
and sharing browsing history with-
out permission is still legal.
Internet companies have had the 
legal right to sell browsing data for 
some time now. Google, for example, 
makes a large portion of its revenue 
by selling search data to advertising 
companies. However, Google keeps 
this browsing history anonymized. 
This means that the bill Congress 
passed is not a change, but a preser-
vation of the status quo.
Browsing data is a gold mine for 
advertising companies, as it reveals 
customer’s shopping trends, mo-
tivations, and interests. Thanks to 
technology, for the ?rst time in his-
tory, companies have a wealth of in-
formation (referred to as Big Data) 
that shows what kinds of products 
customers would buy, and what kind 
of advertising has the most ef?cacy. 
This means that there is no more 
need for cumbersome focus groups. 
Companies could potentially drive 
their pro?ts way up with this data, 
which is why this bill is their dream 
come true. To the everyday user, 
this just shows how much compa-
nies can analyze and manipulate 
their customers in order to increase 
pro?t — which is a trend pervasive 
in capitalism.
Few people, even conservative 
citizens, feel comfortable with this 
development. The new bill goes 
against conservatives’ ethos of small 
government. Deducing Congress’ 
motivations is thus a guessing game. 
A possible hunch is that ISPs may be 
lobbying Republican representatives 
by offering increased ?nancial sup-
port, much like the National Ri?e 
Association does whenever open 
gun ownership is threatened with 
checks.
Or perhaps Congress may just be 
following the Republican agenda of 
undoing anything and everything 
Obama-related. We saw this with 
Trump’s approval of the Dakota 
Access Pipeline, a project President 
Obama had halted. Then, we saw 
this in the failed attempt to repeal 
and replace the Affordable Care 
Act, an action that would have cut 
off millions of Americans from de-
cent health care. Just this month, 
we saw Obama’s policy of indirect 
military action in Syria shredded by 
the launch of 59 tomahawk missiles 
into the war-torn nation, a command 
Trump gave over dessert.
It doesn’t help that the Obama 
administration attempted to pass the 
FCC bill in its ?nal days. Representa-
tives probably viewed this as a last-
minute, erratic action that should 
not have been attempted in an elec-
tion year; hence, its undoing. A simi-
lar excuse was given when Merrick 
Garland, United States Court of 
Appeals chief judge, was offered 
the Supreme Court nomination by 
President Obama in 2016.
No matter what Congress’ true 
intentions are behind this bill, it’s 
clear that partisanship plays a large 
role in it. The polarization of Ameri-
can politics today, exempli?ed by 
the last election season, has placed 
Washington under gridlock time 
and time again; nevertheless, pro-
tection of user data should not be a 
Republican-Democrat battleground, 
but an American issue. Since the on-
slaught of the War on Terror, the U.S. 
government has conducted mass sur-
veillance of its own citizens, a haunt-
ing truth outed by infamous former 
NSA employee Edward Snowden. 
Should this bill pass, our govern-
ment would have failed to protect 
the privacy of the American people 
once again.
It would be a mistake to assume 
that Congress is solely to blame for 
the decreasing respect for internet 
privacy; ISPs are equally at fault. 
They attack user rights continually, 
and the ?ght for net neutrality dem-
onstrates this. Net neutrality is still 
a much-debated topic of argument 
in American politics today, despite a 
growing concern that denying it will 
be increasingly annoying and harm-
ful for users. Comcast’s slowing of 
streaming speeds on Net?ix, its rival 
website, was hurtful to fair competi-
tion. And today, ISPs’ wishes to sell 
browsing history for pro?t continues 
the trend of hurting users.
Expectedly, many are protesting 
the FCC bill. Instead of asking for 
its repeal, people online are await-
ing its passing, so they can purchase 
and share the browsing history of 
representatives who supported it — 
a taste of their own medicine. This 
won’t be possible, however, since 
the sharing of individually identi?-
able information is prohibited by the 
Telecommunications Act.
One could argue that purpose-
fully targeted ads by corporations 
are identi?able information, but the 
wording of the Act becomes much 
more lenient when dealing with ag-
gregate customer information and 
data anonymization. Up to $140,000 
has been raised to purchase this 
browsing history that will never be 
up for sale.
Are there steps you can take to 
protect your browsing history? Ab-
solutely. ISPs can monitor what 
websites you visit, even after you’ve 
locally clear that your browsing his-
tory, thanks to internet protocol (IP) 
addresses. IP addresses are unique 
nine-digit numbers that identify 
computers and the webpages they 
request. It’s possible to adopt a tem-
porary IP address with a virtual pri-
vate network, which can be turned 
on easily in any computer or phone’s 
settings. Another more robust option 
is to use an infamous program called 
Tor, which makes your computer 
completely anonymous.
If you do not wish to protect your 
browsing history because you have 
nothing to hide, that’s equally ac-
ceptable. All evidence thus far sug-
gests that it will be anonymized. But, 
as the saying goes, it’s better to be 
safe than sorry.

After months of consistent pro-
tests, South Korea, as of March 9, 
2017, has successfully impeached 
the former president Park Geun-
Hye, and since March 30, she 
has been under arrest. The world 
watched in fascination as hundreds 
of thousands of Koreans expressed 
their discontent through rallies 
starting Oct. 26, 2016, which in-
cluded a candlelight rally involving 
an estimated of 1.7 million people 
on the streets. In response to the im-
peachment, American television ac-
tor Chris Meloni comically tweeted: 
“Dear South Korea, how? Asking for 
a country.” Certainly, Meloni is not 
alone in feeling this way; the thou-
sands of retweets and likes con?rm 
that others have at least consid-
ered this sentiment worthy of their 
attention.
As a U.S. citizen who voted in 
the 2016 presidential election and 
a daughter of two Korean citizens, 
this tweet called me to compare 
the nation I proudly call home to 
the country my parents call home. 
While people in the U.S. were glued 
to their screens watching the presi-
dential debates leading up to the 
election in November 2016, people 
in Korea gave their government a 
piece of their minds by congregating 
in the streets and demanding that 
Park step down.
Park was a historic president 
for South Korea; not only was she 
the ?rst female president, but she 
was also the ?rst president to be 
impeached. The daughter of the 
late former leader Park Chung-hee 
represented the Saenuri Party, now 
the Liberty Korea Party, and won 
the presidential election on Feb. 25, 
2013. However, her popularity rap-
idly went downhill starting in Oct. 
2016 when a journalist of JoongAng 
Ilbo Tongyang Broadcasting Compa-
ny (JTBC) found the tablet of Park’s 
longtime friend, Choi Soon-Sil.
This tablet, which lacked pass-
word protection, was disposed right 
outside Choi’s residence and con-
tained con?dential information, in-
cluding major presidential speeches 
and important national security and 
diplomatic documents. As a result, 
Park was accused of leaking of?cial 
state documents to Choi Soon-Sil, 
who gave Park “her personal opin-
ion” despite her not holding any pub-
lic of?ce. This led to a public apology 
from Park, in which she apologized 
for sharing the state documents and 
admitted that Choi looked at “some 
documents,” although not specify-
ing which documents or with what 
purpose. She tried to redeem herself 
by claiming she did so “out of pure 
heart,” but the country was not con-
vinced.
The people were unhappy with 
Choi not only because of the obvious 
breech of national security, but also 
because of discontent with Choi’s 
family. Choi is the daughter of the 
late Choi Tae-Min, a religious cult 
leader and former mentor of Park, 
following Park’s mother’s assassi-
nation in 1974. The connection was 
initiated when he allegedly had a 
dream that Park’s mother appeared 
in and asked him to help her. He 
established the Eternal Life Church 
as the “Future Buddha” and asked 
diplomats to refer to him as “Korea’s 
Rasputin” in private. However, Choi 
was a “pseudo-pastor” who used 
Park in order to secure bribes in 
hopes to receive political gain.
Park’s approval ratings prior had 
?t in the 30 to 50 percent range dur-
ing her ?rst three years in of?ce. 
However, this scandal plummeted 
the approval rating to 21.1 percent, 
which ultimately slipped down to 
a mere 4 percent. The approval 
rates of the conservatives in the 
southeast, who had generally been 
most supportive of Park, fell in the 
single digit zone, and zero percent 
of Koreans under the age of 30 sup-
ported Park.
These mind-boggling statistics 
came to life on the streets. South 
Koreans decided they’d had enough 
with a government being prod-
ded by the president’s friend. Thus, 
people of all ages gathered together 
to hold candles and signs asking 
Korea “who’s the real president?” 
This sparked a movement of pro-
tests for the following months. In re-
sponse, Park made a second apology 
Koreans speak out, impeach president

EMMETT ELDRED
It’s a well-worn political cliche to 
say that rival factions within a politi-
cal movement (e.g. the Tea Party vs. 
moderate Republicans) are “?ght-
ing for the soul” of their party. And 
the same cliche has been used time 
and again in the aftermath of 2016 
to describe the tension within the 
Democratic party between its pro-
gressive movement and its more 
moderate “establishment.” Like most 
cliches, this characterization isn’t 
without truth — elements within the 
Democratic Party certainly are vying 
to shape its message and determine 
its strategy. But like most cliches, this 
is also a somewhat stale and hack-
neyed way to describe what’s going 
on. In truth, the party is struggling to 
rediscover its soul altogether.
A recent report from The New York 
Times showed that approximately 
one in four white working class vot-
ers who had voted for Barack Obama 
in 2012 switched to vote for Donald 
Trump in 2016. Factors like a voter’s 
political party and their previous vot-
ing history are typically some of the 
strongest metrics analysts can use to 
predict who someone will support in 
an election. But in 2016, an unusually 
high amount of registered Democrats 
and Obama voters switched to sup-
port Trump, often switching to vote 
for Republicans down the ballot as 
well. Although much has been made 
about turnout — high turnout in ru-
ral areas of key swing states and low 
turnout in urban areas — The New 
York Times argues that the real sto-
ry — the real puzzle — of 2016 was 
why so many Obama voters favored 
Trump.
More puzzling still, the very vot-
ers that jumped the Democratic ship 
in 2016 and handed Donald Trump 
the White House were once the heart 
and soul of the Democratic Party. The 
white working class has long been a 
core Democratic constituency, but 
they have been steadily bleeding 
from the Democratic Party over the 
past few decades. Their departure 
has been fueled by declining union 
membership, escalating culture 
wars, and economic disaffection. 
Even though Clinton couldn’t have 
expected to win this block of voters 
given recent voter trends, her paltry 
performance among them, including 
even those who had voted twice for 
Obama, should warn Democrats that 
they need to act quickly to reclaim 
the voters who were once their base.
Ultimately, it all comes down to 
message and political strategy. Fortu-
nately for Democrats, we don’t have 
to ?gure out something totally new. 
We just have to return to the mes-
sages and strategies that have served 
Democrats for decades. We need to 
rediscover our heart and soul. That’s 
how we’ll win.
Democrats already have the best 
policies for this block of voters. No-
body bene?ts more from strong 
unions and a higher minimum wage 
than the working class. Nor does 
any group stand to gain more from 
a robust social safety net, universal 
healthcare, and strong investments 
in public education. But ask any 
white working class Trump voter why 
they voted for Trump, and jobs and 
the economy will be at the top of the 
list. Those of us cloistered in our ivo-
ry towers and cosmopolitan utopias 
often muse condescendingly about 
why poor white voters “vote against 
their self-interest.” Well, they don’t. 
At least not what they understand 
those interests to be. Nobody goes 
out and votes for what they think 
will hurt themselves. Politics is about 
who can make the better argument. 
And Democrats have lost the argu-
ment about which party is better for 
working people because our message 
has been ?awed. Democrats need to 
return to the messages that resonate 
with all voters: “We will help you get 
a well-paying job. We will help your 
family and your community thrive.”
Democrats also need to return 
back to the strategic models that have 
helped them win elections in the 
past. Historically, Democrats have 
a built-in advantage when it comes 
to grassroots organizing, ?eld strat-
egy, and voter turnout operations. 
When Democratic campaigns are at 
their best, they are fueled by people: 
union canvassers, energetic students 
and young people, Democratic com-
mittee people and their families, etc. 
When Democratic campaigns win, it 
is because they have a groundswell 
of people behind them; people who 
are passionate about their causes and 
bring electricity to the campaign.
But Democrats have been seduced 
by the siren song of money in politics. 
This is where Republicans excel, and 
Democratic leaders have sought in 
recent years to beat Republicans at 
their own game. But that is a foolish 
exercise. Republican voters simply 
have more money than Democratic 
voters. Far more millionaires and bil-
lionaires support Republicans. Ditto 
for corporations. Democrats have 
made raising huge sums of money 
from wealthy voters and corpora-
tions central to their strategy, con-
vinced that if they can bring in the 
most money, the rest will fall into 
place. Certainly, money has an unfor-
tunate power in today’s politics, and 
if Democrats can’t fundraise, they 
can’t compete. But Democrats will 
never be able to raise money the way 
Republicans do. And when they try to 
cozy up to wealthy donors and Wall 
Street, all they end up doing is alien-
ating the people at their base.
If Democrats want to win in the 
future, they need to embrace grass-
roots fundraising models like the one 
employed by Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I–
VT) campaign. In 2015-2016 Sand-
ers raised millions upon millions of 
dollars from small-dollar donations 
averaging just $27. If Democrats can 
emulate this model, they can bring 
synergy between the need for money 
in today’s politics and their greatest 
strength, which is their people.
Democrats shouldn’t be battling 
for their party’s soul. Instead, the dif-
ferent ideological factions within the 
party must work together to redis-
cover what once made them a great 
and successful political movement. 
Democrats have always disagreed. 
We’ll never be of one voice on every 
aspect of policy. But Democrats suc-
ceed when they have a strong mes-
sage about the economy, and when 
they fuel their campaigns not with big 
money, but with committed people. 
That’s where the heart and soul of 
the Democratic party lies. It’s a party 
comprised of ordinary people ?ght-
ing for policies that help ordinary 
people. Going forward, Democrats 
need to put working people back at 
the center of their platform, their 
message, and their political strategy.

Everyone has a “type.” Whether 
funny or serious, suave or dorky, 
broad or slender, artistic or athletic 
— or all of the above — everyone 
has their own preferences in dating. 
These are usually based on personal 
background, past experiences, sense 
of humor… the list is endless. And, in 
general, harmless, too.
Except when it’s not.
Except when someone’s “type” is 
based on stereotype, a preconceived 
image, a media-induced trope. When 
one such type is embraced by many 
and accelerated into a social phe-
nomenon, until it earns its own name 
— “yellow fever.”
Defenders of this tendency, in 
which men choose to date exclusively 
Asian women, claim that it’s harmless 
— that these men only pursue Asian 
women because they prefer physi-
cally Asian features, or because they 
admire that culture and heritage.
This, in and of itself, is not harm-
ful. Preference for certain physical 
characteristics is natural, and, of 
course, not racist. However, “yellow 
fever” is, unfortunately, not solely 
due to physical preferences.
In a couple of articles published 
over the last few weeks, staffwriter 
Brandon Schmuck defended the 
trend by arguing that this prefer-
ence for Asian women stems from 
many different reasons, varying from 
person to person, and therefore is not 
inherently racist.
Unfortunately, this trend is not 
a result of a multitude of reasons; 
despite the complexity of human at-
traction, it is simple enough to gen-
eralize the central, most damaging 
reason. While there are, of course, 
some men who prefer Asian women 
for solely physical or cultural rea-
sons, the de?ning characteristic of 
this movement, and the reason it 
has garnered such fervid criticism, is 
racial stereotyping.
Schmuck stated in his last article 
that “People are attracted to various 
traits … and this attraction is rooted 
on a subconscious level.” Very true. 
So is racism.
This historically intricate preju-
dice has transformed and developed 
over its many years of existence in 
this country. Over the past few years, 
conscious racism has faded away, at 
least in communities of education 
and intellect. What is left is subcon-
scious racism — a lingering but very 
potent remnant of the prejudice that 
has af?icted this society for so long.
No upstanding citizen would con-
sider themselves to be racist. Yet it 
persists, subtle perceptions and im-
ages that affect our thought patterns, 
little actions, and, yes, attractions.
These men who suffer from “yel-
low fever” are, most likely, not in-
tentionally idealizing Asian women, 
nor would they consider themselves 
to be racist. They admire physical 
features, yes, but they also subcon-
sciously project preconceived images 
onto any Asian woman that they see, 
so that she automatically becomes 
more attractive because of those 
perspectives.
It is these images that are so harm-
ful in this society, these stereotypes 
that have caused such a vitriolic reac-
tion to “yellow fever.” These various 
images of submission and docility or 
exoticism and intrigue still reside in 
our culture regarding Asian women, 
and have taken shape in this bizarre 
social phenomenon.
One may argue further that ra-
cial preferences are unrelated to 
stereotypes. But speaking as an 
Asian woman who’s been pursued 
speci?cally because of her ethnicity, 
it doesn’t feel innocent, or compli-
mentary, or appreciative of culture. 
It feels degrading. It feels stained, 
foul. It feels like every stereotype of 
submission or exoticism forced on me 
at once.
It is true that we live within a po-
litical bubble, and it is an admirable 
pursuit to expand on-campus discus-
sion to include complex and lesser-
heard opinions. I agree that every 
opinion is worthy of being heard — 
and disputed. So don’t be astonished, 
then, when an opinion that affronts 
and, for some, personally insults, re-
ceives a lavish and ardent response.

No one should have to ?ght to vote in modern America
Democrats must seriously consider universal health care
on Nov. 4, promising to take respon-
sibility if she was found guilty. Her 
third apology came not too long after, 
where she, on the 20th of the same 
month, admitted to being willing to 
resign by asking Parliament how and 
when to give up her power. On Dec. 
9, Parliament voted to impeach Park, 
and on March 9, the Constitutional 
Court unanimously upheld this deci-
sion.
Today, Korea ?nds their elec-
tion, which was originally supposed 
to be held on Dec. 20, 2017, pushed 
up to May 2017. Moon Jae-In repre-
sents the Democratic Party and had a 
strong lead in the polls until recently; 
Moderate Ahn Cheol-Soo of the cen-
ter-left People’s Party has received 
support from a wide range of people 
including conservatives, centrists, 
and skeptics of Moon.
Despite the fact that Moon was on 
the trajectory of becoming the next 
president, according to analysts, Ahn 
now regularly stands within a few 
points from Moon, and some polls 
even put Ahn ahead of Moon. In a 
poll, Korean Broadcasting System 
(KBS) showed, with a 95 percent 
con?dence interval, 38 percent of 
Korean voters supported Moon and 
35 percent supported Ahn. This is an 
increase of 25 percentage points for 
Ahn within the past two weeks.With 
less than a month before Koreans 
of?cially cast their votes, it is nearly 
impossible to state who will succeed 
Park. Whether the next president is 
Ahn or Moon, Korea will now enter 
a new chapter in history that demon-
strates the people’s power in a demo-
cratic society.
Now, in regards to Meloni’s tweet, 
there are many reasons why the peo-
ple of South Korea were discontent 
with their democracy and even more 
reasons leading up to the impeach-
ment. Although we may not be able 
to perfectly emulate their strategy or 
even get the desired result, their re-
silience is truly worthy of attention 
and has ultimately overthrown their 
president.
The people united to achieve their 
common goal — bringing a democ-
racy that represented them, not the 
interests of a select few. They ex-
pressed their beliefs in such a strik-
ingly peaceful manner. Each poster, 
testimony, popular song that was 
modi?ed to criticize Park, and candle 
coalesced to form a force that proved 
the importance of the people in a de-
mocracy.

After the Republicans’ failure to 
pass their Affordable Care Act (ACA) 
replacement, the American Health 
Care Act (AHCA), House Speaker 
Paul Ryan declared the ACA “the 
law of the land ... for the foresee-
able future,” but that fact hasn’t dis-
suaded Republicans from continuing 
to brainstorm ACA alternatives. The 
Democrats, on the other hand, have 
been relatively hesitant to present 
new ideas in healthcare reform, a 
seemingly reasonable position, con-
sidering their current lack of control 
in any branch of government, but it 
is precisely their current dearth of 
power that necessitates the excite-
ment for the Democratic Party that a 
more progressive plan would gener-
ate. Now is the time for Democrats to 
begin seriously considering universal 
health care.
Universal health care is about en-
suring that everyone, regardless of 
their income status, gender, or any-
thing else, has access to the medical 
care they need. It’s about guarantee-
ing people the basic freedom to live 
healthy, ful?lling lives. A person who 
can’t afford treatment for an illness 
or injury is not free, since, depend-
ing on the nature of the condition, 
they might not be able to run, walk, 
go to school, go to work, pursue their 
dreams, or attain physical comfort. 
Health care policy that does not guar-
antee coverage for all is, therefore, an 
obstruction to freedom-for-all. Uni-
versal health care would be consis-
tent with American ideals because it 
would increase access to such quint-
essentially American values such as 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness.
The AHCA, which kept the ACA 
provisions on preexisting conditions 
and under 25-year-olds staying on 
their parents’ plans while revamping 
nearly everything else, failed because 
it was a centrist proposal that made 
no one happy. Far-right and liber-
tarian Republicans, as represented 
by the Freedom caucus, felt that the 
AHCA didn’t move far enough away 
from the ACA, while moderates of 
both parties and progressive Demo-
crats had liked the ACA and felt that 
Ryan’s new bill was a step in the 
wrong direction, especially after the 
Congressional Budget Of?ce released 
a report stating that the AHCA would 
leave 24 million fewer insured by 
2026.
Even the ACA was somewhat of 
a compromise. The ACA’s individual 
mandate aspect, which funds the in-
surance by requiring anyone not al-
ready covered by an employer to have 
ACA coverage, actually dates back to 
a plan proposed in the ‘80s by the 
Heritage Foundation, a conservative 
think tank, as an alternative to single-
payer coverage (universal health care 
is entirely funded by the govern-
ment). The individual mandate has 
also been appropriated over the years 
by many other conservatives such as 
Mitt Romney in his Massachusetts 
health care reform of 2006. Because 
the ACA used an individual mandate, 
it was supposed to be bipartisan, con-
sensus legislation, but instead, the 
bill was subject to much obstruction-
ism at the hands of the Republicans.
What Barack Obama missed in 
planning his bill was that Republi-
cans always saw individual mandates 
as a compromise. Most Republicans, 
including Ryan himself, 
who advanced an indi-
vidual mandate bill of his 
own to reform Medicare in 
2011, only ever liked the 
idea of the individual 
mandate in comparison 
to more socialist op-
tions like single-payer 
or Medicare.
The plan was al-
ways to use individual 
mandate reforms as a 
stepping stone and not an 
end goal. When Obama, 
a liberal Democrat, started 
his health care reform at indi-
vidual mandates, he advanced 
a plan that no one was truly en-
thused about and moved everyone 
to the right. Having secured the cen-
ter, Republicans were now free to 
focus on more conservative reform 
options.
Democrats must not let the ACA 
become the new left. They must 
learn from the failures of so-called 
compromise bills like the AHCA and 
ACA to garner widespread support: 
centrist reform makes no one happy. 
Universal health care, on the other 
hand, garners bipartisan progres-
sive support. A May 2016 Gallup poll 
found that the majority of Americans, 
including even a signi?cant chunk 
of Republicans, want to replace the 
ACA with a single-payer system. A 
universal coverage system like single-
payer provides a cohesive solution to 
health care consistent with progres-
sive and American values that people 
can truly get behind.
Now that the AHCA is off the ta-
ble, Democrats must take this open-
ing to advance a universal coverage 
plan such as single-payer insurance. 
There is even already a proposed 
single-payer bill that has 
been in the works in the House 
since 2003. Introduced by Repre-
sentative John Conyers (D–MI), the 
Expanded and Improved Medicare 
for All Act would, as promised in 
name, install universal health care 
by expanding the current Medicare 
system. Such a plan would ?x the 
remaining issues left by the ACA, 
ensuring that anyone with an injury 
or illness has the resources to heal. 
Such a bill would gain enthusiastic 
support and restore public faith in 
the Democratic Party at a time when 
the Party needs it most.
If the Democrats wait too long, 
Republicans will come up with a 
more conservative plan to generate 
similar enthusiastic support from 
their own base — enough to actually 
pass this time. An additional bonus 
of advancing a single-payer bill like 
Conyers’ is that it would restore in-
dividual mandates to the center and 
force conservative Republicans to 
support the ACA, as a truly moderate 
alternative.
If the Republicans manage to pass 
a more conservative bill, the num-
ber insured would surely decrease. 
Republicans would claim such a bill 
as a win for their party, but in reality, 
it would be a loss for the American 
public. A nation is only as healthy as 
its citizens, and a nation where it is 
possible for a citizen to be ill and un-
insured is certainly unwell.

For a country that boasts fair and 
free elections, the United States of 
America has an extensive history 
of hosting regulations preventing 
its citizens from participating in a 
democratic society. In 1870, the 
Fifteenth Amendment legally 
allowed black men to vote. 
In 1920, the Nineteenth 
Amendment prohib-
ited gender from 
being a factor in letting a vote count. 
However, constitutional amend-
ments only have so much effect. 
There are many barriers that prevent 
many black Americans, especially in 
the south, from their right to par-
ticipate in a democratic government. 
In 1965, once the Voting Rights Act 
(VRA) was signed and of?cially en-
acted, the national ?ght for suffrage 
seemed to be over. Unfair voting 
regulations that disproportionately 
targeted black voters, such as literacy 
tests, were deemed unconstitution-
al, yet that did not prevent partisan 
measures from ?nding ways to skew 
elections in their respective party’s 
favor.
Writer Ari Berman noticed this 
lack of coverage of voting rights, or 
some people’s lack thereof, between 
1965 and present-day. He took initia-
tive on informing people about this 
ongoing issue by writing Give Us the 
Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting 
Rights in America and visiting Carn-
egie Mellon University on March 12. 
“We are in 2017, but our voting pro-
tection laws are starting to look like 
they’re from 1817,” Berman stated. 
He argued that the rise of new vot-
ing regulations, coupled with fear of 
voter fraud, could be a threat to de-
mocracy as we know it.
Thus far, it has been pri-
marily Republicans being 
caught attempting to meddle 
with voting regulations. In 
2010, Shelby County in Ala-
bama ?led a court case claim-
ing the VRA, speci?cally Section 
4(b) and 5, was unconstitutional 
and an instance in which federal 
government interfered with what 
should be within state boundar-
ies. Section 4(b) de?ned an eli-
gible voting district as any state or 
district in a state in which a voting 
test was held starting November 1, 
1964 and had less than 50 percent 
turnout for the 1964 presidential 
election; Section 5 prohibited eli-
gible districts, as de?ned in Section 
4(b), from altering election laws and 
procedures without gaining of?cial 
authorization. Ultimately, this piv-
otal portion of the VRA was deemed 
unconstitutional.
Although it may be easy to dismiss 
a suburban area in Alabama, it is im-
perative to realize this was among 
one of many strides made by states to 
silence voters. For example, it is still 
dif?cult for many citizens to acquire 
a form of legal identi?cation; states 
limiting what they recognize as a 
legitimate form of identi?cation for 
voting further exacerbates the prob-
lem at hand. In Texas, one can vote 
with a concealed-weapon permit but 
not with a student ID. In addition,  
Arizona, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
and Ohio do not accept student IDs. 
Those who support the Republican 
Party are more likely to have such 
forms of identi?cations than those 
who support the Democratic Party.
North Carolina shows a further 
instance of voter suppression. The 
largely Republican Legislature re-
quested data of voting preference 
by race, which allowed them to pro-
pose a bill that greatly reduced early 
voting, including several days of 
Sunday voting. This disproportion-
ately affected black voters, and North 
Carolina exposed their intention be-
hind the bill when explaining their 
bill’s effect on “counties with Sunday 
voting,” which were “disproportion-
ately black...[and] disproportionate-
ly Democratic.” The U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the 4th Circuit saw straight 
through this transparent bill and de-
nounced it as a bill that “target[ed] 
African Americans with almost sur-
gical precision,” thus blocking it. 
However, North Carolina was still 
successful in signi?cantly reducing 
early voting.
In consideration of strides to sup-
press votes such as those, it is trou-
bling, yet worth noting, that voter 
turnout hit a low in the 2016 presi-
dential election. Many eligible voters 
were unable to do so. Although many 
may have not voted because of fac-
tors such as misleading poll numbers, 
a signi?cant portion of this country 
had their voices ignored.
Where our country heads from 
this point forward is uncertain. As 
former president Barack Obama said, 
there have been consistent efforts to 
“turn back the clock [of] progress” 
by undermining the VRA “from the 
moment the ink was dry.” Although 
hurdles such as the Shelby County 
vs. Holder case has created a bar pre-
venting many from voting, Obama 
calls for us to remember that “prog-
ress does not come easy, but that it 
must be vigorously defended and 
built upon for ourselves and future 
generations.” With a president in of-
?ce who, through Twitter, set off con-
spiracies of voter fraud, it is impera-
tive for us all to remain cognizant of 
our right to freedom of speech and 
democracy’s gift to the people — the 
right to cast their ballots.

Cassini will ?y between Saturn’s rings for ?rst time ever
Breakthrough made in Zika detection
Scientists recently 
developed SHERLOCK, a new 
and more robust diagnostic 
system. SHERLOCK, a 
variation of CRISPR, is better 
at detecting diseases and 
distinguishing the Zika virus 
from its close variant Dengue.
Until now, CRISPR has 
been used to edit genomes. 
Scientists noticed its potential 
to detect viruses, but this 
functionality was not exploited 
until now. SHERLOCK is one 
million times better than 
the current means of Zika 
detection, ELISA, which 
searches for speci?c proteins. 
SHERLOCK works with RNA, 
which is found in a virus’ cell 
nuclei.
Overall, SHERLOCK means 
faster and more accurate 
detection of the Zika virus. 
The scientists who designed it 
are planning to commercialize 
it, making it widely available. 
They are even thinking of 
launching a startup around 
their newfound product; how-
ever, before any of this can 
happen, SHERLOCK will have 
to be approved for use.

New leak exposes NSA hacking tools
In what seems like an 
episode of Mr. Robot, a hack-
ing group TheShadowBrokers 
somehow obtained and 
released sensitive National 
Surveillance Agency (NSA) 
tools on hacking Windows 
computers and ?nancial net-
works. The tool includes 
security breaches for older 
versions of Windows and 
the SWIFT banking network 
used for transferring money 
internationally.
The ?les are still available 
online on GitHub. Microsoft 
quickly released a patch to 
eliminate the vulnerability the 
hack revealed. A patch doesn’t 
solve the problem entirely, 
since users who do not install 
it are still at risk.
TheShadowBrokers group 
emerged in August last year. 
It’s unknown who the hackers 
are, but rumors link them 
to Russia. Their hacks are 
accompanied by purposefully 
broken English with vague 
messages; one such message 
reads, “Is being too bad 
nobody deciding to be paying 
theshadowbrokers.”

Oceans found on gas giants’ moons
NASA recently announced 
that Jupiter’s moon Europa 
and Saturn’s moon Enceladus 
may be the best bets for life 
outside of Earth in our solar 
system. The announcement 
was made at NASA’s head-
quarters in Washington D.C.
The Cassini probe 
analyzed the composition of 
water plumes rising out of 
Enceladus’ surface cracks. 
Large amounts of hydrogen 
were found, suggesting that 
oceans of liquid water lie 
beneath the icy surface. “Now 
Enceladus is high on the list 
in the solar system for show-
ing habitable conditions,” said 
Hunter Waite, leader of the 
Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass 
Spectrometer team at the 
Southwest Research Institute.
Plumes composed of 
salty water were found on 
Europa’s surface, albeit not 
as ubiquitous as is the case on 
Enceladus. The data Cassini 
sent back suggests that a 
pocket of warm water lies 
beneath the surface at the 
location of the plumes, ripe 
conditions for life.

The Cassini probe has spent the last 13 
years orbiting Saturn at a distance, faithfully 
gathering data and sending it back to Earth. 
Now, it is entering the ?nal stage of its mission, 
named the Grand Finale, and will eventually 
plunge into the planet itself.
NASA describes the Cassini mission as “one 
of the most ambitious efforts in planetary 
space exploration.” Launched in 1997, Cassini 
revealed the landscapes of Saturn’s moons: 
geysers on Enceladus, lakes of methane on 
Titan, an oxygen atmosphere on Rhea. 
It also discovered multiple new moons. 
Cassini photographed and collected data from 
Saturn’s atmosphere and composition. 
It observed rare weather phenomena, 
like two storms merging and another storm 
wrapping its way around the planet end-to-
end. The probe also examined Saturn’s rings in 
a level of detail never before possible.
Much of what we know about Saturn, and 
almost all we know about its moons, comes 
from the Cassini mission and its cargo, the 
Huygens probe; nonetheless, even after two 
decades in space, Cassini still has more to learn 
in its last months.
Cassini, on its 127th and ?nal trip past 
Saturn’s moon Titan, will use the moon’s 
gravity to swing into a tighter orbit around 
Saturn. 
This closer orbit will place Cassini between 
Saturn and its rings, a space that has never 
been studied before.
From this new perspective, Cassini will help 
scientists learn more about Saturn’ gravity 
and magnetic ?eld, as well as clear up some 
persistent mysteries like how fast the planet 
rotates. It will also take the clearest photographs 
yet of the innermost moons. 
Cassini will also explore Saturn’s rings and 
attempt to determine their age, mass, and 
composition. 
Like the previous stages of Cassini’s journey, 
this ?nal expedition promises rich new data. “It 
will be like a whole new mission,” according to 
Linda Spilker, Cassini’s project scientist at JPL.
After 22 close orbits over the next ?ve 
months, Cassini will have exhausted its fuel. 
On Sept. 15, one month short of twenty years 
of service, it will hurtle directly into Saturn’s 
atmosphere. 
It will collect and transmit atmospheric data 
until it is crushed and ultimately disintegrated 
by Saturn’s gravity. Planetary scientist Sarah 
Horst assures us that “even in its ?nal moments, 
Cassini will be doing groundbreaking science.”
Cassini will discover how the rings’ material 
is distributed, and how they may have formed. 
These revelations will in turn inform scientists 
about the evolution of planets in our solar 
system. 
Cassini has been one of the most succesful 
exploration and data collection missions.

Startup Zunum Aero wants to make hybrid planes the norm
JOSH ANDAH
SciTech Editor
Americans currently prefer 
to drive, take the bus, or ride 
the train for regional journeys 
(i.e. journeys within state, 
or less than 1,000 miles). 
Planes aren’t that popular of 
an option, because getting 
on them is much more 
cumbersome than getting in 
a car. After all, why would 
anyone go through the hassle 
of airport security and ticket 
prices just to travel from 
Boston to New York?
A startup called Zunum 
Aero wants to make the plane 
the go-to option. With tickets 
as cheap as $25 and extremely 
quick boarding times, thanks 
to limited security screen-
ing, Zunum’s ?ights will be 
as convenient as taking a 
bus. The Zunum Aero team is 
made of pilots, Ph.D. holders, 
and ?ight scientists. Its CEO, 
Ashish Kumar, was inspired 
by the disruptive nature of 
electric aircraft, and hopes his 
startup will inspire others.
Zunum’s business plan 
includes such cheap tickets 
thanks to one thing: hybrid 
planes. These are planes that 
run their engines on electricity, 
or fuel if batteries do not have 
enough charge. These planes 
offer much cheaper tickets 
than conventional airlines 
because ticket pricing is not as 
dependent on ?uctuating fuel 
prices.
There isn’t much else 
beyond regional ?ights Zunum 
Aero can offer at the moment. 
With hybrid planes, range 
is greatly limited by battery 
technology, because batteries 
can only hold so much charge 
today. The technology is 
gradually improving, though. 
The startup will initially offer 
700 mile journeys. As better 
batteries are produced with 
time, Zunum will begin to 
consider journeys of up to 
1,000 miles. Improved battery 
technology will help make 
Zunum Aero’s planes fully 
electric someday. For now, its 
planes rely partially on fuel to 
complete their journeys.
Zunum Aero will have 
tough competition in the 
future. Many startups are 
tackling the challenge of 
faster regional commutes. 
Hyperloop, for example, will 
shorten travel time between 
San Francisco and Los Angeles 
to 20 minutes once it’s up 
and running. Zunum Aero’s 
amazing $25 offer may be 
what wins the competition, 
however.
In an era of climate 
change, many companies 
are searching for alternative 
plane technology to counter 
the fuel jet engine. Currently, 
short ?ights produce up to 40 
percent of aviation emissions 
in the United States. The ozone 
layer has weakened drastically 
over the decades, and this 
may be partially due to the 
commercial airline industry. 
Zunum Aero’s planes will have 
zero emissions while running 
on electricity. Air pollution 
isn’t the only type of pollution 
Zunum Aero is taking on. Its 
planes will be incredibly quiet, 
reducing noise pollution over 
suburban areas.
Solar Impulse 2 is a plane 
that made history in 2016 
by ?ying around the world, 
powered only by solar pan-
els. Although Solar Impulse 
2 soars at a mere 140 kilome-
ters per hour, its achievement 
signals that the future of clean 
air travel is budding. As solar 
panels become more ef?cient, 
solar planes could begin to 
compete commercially with 
fuel jet airliners.
If there’s one thing the 
airline industry demonstrates 
time and time again, it’s that 
a business plan is as important 
as the technology itself. For 
example, the cutting-edge 
technology that was the 
supersonic Concorde couldn’t 
survive because it didn’t make 
enough pro?t and was costly 
to service. If Zunum Aero’s 
cheap ticket prices are enough 
to service planes, replace worn 
out batteries, and pay staff, 
then it has a strong future. 
Large companies such as 
Boeing and Jet Blue certainly 
think Zunum Aero has a future 
and a lot of promise. That’s 
why those two companies 
have established themselves 
as the startup’s partners.

PUGWASH
RUIHAO YE
Special to The Tartan
Members of Carnegie 
Mellon Student Pugwash 
attended the Student 
Pugwash Conference 2017 
at Purdue University. The 
conference focused on space 
exploration and policy, 
ranging from topics like 
“Repeat Mars Missions” to 
the “Future of International 
Space Exploration”. Each of 
these talks had interesting 
angles on how the world could 
approach space exploration. 
This article focuses on the 
talk on international progress 
on space?ight given by Dr. 
Daniel Dumbacher.
Dumbacher framed the 
entire presentation in the 
form of the past, present, 
and future. For the past, he 
focused on the progress of 
the United States in space 
exploration, starting with the 
last lunar mission and ending 
with the closing of the space 
shuttle program. He also 
noted that, at the moment, 
space exploration has 
ventured to every planet in 
the solar system. Dumbacher 
drew parallels between space 
exploration and the Lewis and 
Clark expeditions, suggesting 
that expeditions in unknown 
territory result in the eventual 
expansion.
He moved on to the current 
state of space exploration. 
At the moment, the 
International Space Station 
(ISS) remains one of the few 
international projects still 
in operation. There are also 
robotic exploration missions 
on Mars. Currently, the 
biggest movement in space 
exploration is commercial 
space?ight. Companies are 
driving new and innovative 
technologies like reusable 
spacecraft.
The current plan for 
space exploration follows 
?ve phases. Phase zero, the 
current phase, focuses on 
continued experimentation 
on the challenges of space-
?ight on the International 
Space Station. Phase one will 
include missions in cislunar 
space with emphasis on deep 
space transportation. After 
this, we must face phase 
two’s emphasis on deep space 
transport, which includes 
continued missions to the 
moon. Phase three will start 
testing the viability of manned 
Mars missions. From there, in 
two more phases, humanity 
could potentially accomplish 
the goal of manned missions 
to Mars.
First, we must tackle the 
question, “How can this all 
be done?” The solution to this 
would be a focus on a space-
centered economy. Such focus 
would spur the development 
of technologies that bene?t 
terrestrial and space society.  
At the moment, one example 
of a block to such international 
cooperation is the status of 
China in space. China was 
blocked from access to the 
ISS, so it produced its own 
space program and station.
Another issue is time. 
Dumbacher suggested that 
space exploration may follow 
the rise of commercial aircraft. 
Aircraft arose through 
many years of development 
and growth, with gradual 
growth in adoption. Similar 
development processes 
occurred with the prevalence 
of computers and cell phones. 
Dumbacher suggested that, 
although space exploration 
and travel is pricey, with 
time it may become some-
thing attainable to the public. 
Maybe, even space tourism 
could be on the table.

Men’s Golf
In the closing round of 
the 2017 Carnegie Mellon 
Spring Shootout, the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s golf team carded 
a 294 to end the event with a 
595 (301–294) on Sunday, 
April 9 to win the nine-team 
event. The two-day, 36-hole 
event was held at The Links 
at Spring Church in Apollo, 
Pennsylvania. The win marks 
the Tartans’ third straight on 
the 6,516-yard, par-70 course 
at the annual Shootout.
Junior Nikhil Mohan 
claimed individual medalist 
honors with a ?ve-over par 
145 after carding rounds of 
73 and 72. Sophomore Patrick 
Tan tied for ?fth in a ?eld of 49 
golfers with a 148 (75–73).
Senior George Qian and 
junior Adrian Del Bosque end-
ed the 36-hole event with a 
155. Qian carded rounds of 76 
and 78 while Del Bosque ?red 
rounds of 83 and 71. Senior 
Brad Jennette ?nished a stroke 
behind with a 155 (77–78).
The Tartans had two in-
dividuals play in the invita-
tional, as senior Alexander 
Pomerantz shot a 153 (76–77) 
and sophomore Nicholas 
Moreno carded a 154 (80–74).
Women’s Golf
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s golf team continued 
play at the Carnegie Mellon 
Spring Shootout Sunday, 
April 9 at The Links at Spring 
Church in Apollo, PA. The 
Tartans carded a team score of 
313 on Sunday to win the 36-
hole event with a 631 (318–
313) on the par-72, 5,863-
yard course.
The Tartans’ team score 
of 313 on Sunday topped the 
school record for the lowest 
round while the 631 set the 
school record for the lowest 
two-round score.
First-year Lavonca Davis 
and junior Summer Kitahara 
both shot identical rounds of 
77 and 78 to ?nish with a 155. 
The two Tartans participated 
in a playoff for individual 
medalist honors with Davis 
winning on the second hole of 
a sudden death playoff with a 
birdie putt on hole one after 
both golfers birdied hole 18.
First-year Yedin Lui tied 
a personal-best round of 77 
on Sunday to end the shoot-
out with a 159 (82–77). 
Sophomore Carly Jordan 
carded a 162 (82–80) while 
junior Emma Hoskins shot a 
179 (89–90).
Carnegie Mellon had three 
individuals enter the invite. 
Junior Isabelle Tseng carded a 
167 (87–80), with her score of 
80 on Sunday being a career-
best round. First-year Sanchi 
Gupta ?nished with a 175 (91–
84) and junior Ginger Glass 
shot 198 (100–98). Gupta’s 
round of 84 on Sunday was 
also a personal best.
Men’s Tennis
The seventh-ranked 
Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis 
team defeated previously un-
beaten and 20th-ranked Johns 
Hopkins University, 5–4, on 
Sunday, April 9 at home. The 
Tartans improved to 15–7 on 
the year while the Blue Jays 
fell to 7–1.
Johns Hopkins held a 2–1 
lead after doubles play with 
the no. 3 pair of senior Kenny 
Zheng and ?rst-year Michael 
Rozenvasser winning 8–5 for 
the Tartans.
The Tartans earned the 
?rst singles point after Mike 
Buxbaum had to retire at ?rst 
singles due to an injury.
Johns Hopkins went back 
up one when Jeremy Dubin 
outlasted Rozenvasser in three 
sets at second singles.
Sophomore Chaz Downing 
and senior Kiril Kirkov ?n-
ished at the same time with 
victories at third and sixth sin-
gles giving the Tartans a 4–3 
advantage. Downing rallied to 
win 1–6, 6–1, 7–6 (7–2) while 
Kirkov won 7–6 (7–4), 6–3.
The Blue Jays then tied the 
match at ?fth singles when 
Emerson Walsh won a three-
set match against sophomore 
Vayum Arora, 7-6 (7–4), 1–6, 
6–4.
The ?nal point was earned 
by Zheng for Carnegie Mellon 
when he rallied from a set 
down to win in three sets, 6–7 
(0–7), 7–5, 6–3.
The Tartans will next take 
to the court for game action 
on Friday, April 21 in the 
quarter?nal round of the UAA 
Championship in Altamonte 
Springs, FL.

Rebecca Fortner discusses passion for sports and dreams
IAN TANAYA
Sports Editor
Carnival, the time when 
Carnegie Mellon students take 
part in the quirky traditions of 
constructing themed booths, 
racing their self-constructed 
buggies, and showing off their 
mobile robots in the Mobot 
Races, is almost upon us. 
While most of campus either 
partakes in these weirdly fun 
pastimes, works on semester 
projects of various degrees 
of completion, or takes the 
opportunity to have a good 
night’s sleep, senior hurdler 
and jumper Rebecca Fortner 
will instead travel with the 
women’s track and ?eld team 
to the 2017 University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Outdoor 
Championships, hosted this 
year by the University of 
Chicago.
The passion that the chemi-
cal and biomedical engineer-
ing double major has for her 
craft is evident from her fo-
cus on the competition. “I 
wouldn’t miss it for the world,” 
Fortner said when asked about 
going to the championships 
while much of the rest of cam-
pus is partaking in Carnival.
Her commitment to the 
team is her biggest enjoyment, 
stemming from a life invested 
in sports. “My family is very 
athletic. My dad was a football 
coach, played football, and ran 
track. My mom was also into 
basketball. My sister was into 
cheerleading and gymnastics.” 
With a family like that, it’s no 
wonder that Fortner got in-
volved in athletics early and 
often. “I got into a lot of things 
from gymnastics to cheerlead-
ing, basketball to track.”
It was during high school 
that Fortner realized which 
sport she wanted to focus her 
full effort on. “After I hit my 
growth spurt, I made a state 
championship in track and got 
serious with it.” Her results 
in the sport gave her the con-
?dence to plan on continuing 
the sport in college. “I thought 
I would be able to compete in 
college.”
It was the combination of 
the academic and athletic pro-
grams that attracted Fortner 
to Carnegie Mellon. “Track 
was a big part of why I chose 
here, but the opportunity to 
double major was really huge 
too. Graduating from here will 
be a pretty big deal. My fam-
ily is all from smaller schools 
and colleges, so being able 
to graduate from somewhere 
like Carnegie Mellon is such a 
huge deal.”
It certainly isn’t easy with a 
schedule that starts punching 
the moment the spring semes-
ter starts. “Spring semester, 
our ?rst track meet is the ?rst 
week we come back, and we 
go throughout the whole se-
mester. You have to make sure 
you get as much sleep as you 
can, eat healthy, etc.” Time 
with the team, of course, is not 
always just about track and 
?eld. “Friday nights we all get 
together and watch a movie 
or something so we’re not too 
tired on Saturday.” When it 
comes time to compete, it’s 
all about following the fun-
damentals and supporting 
one another. “We all have our 
separate routines. High jump-
ers will measure steps, prac-
tice together. We all help each 
other during the meet.”
Fortner doesn’t take any 
of her opportunities for 
granted. “I feel like just being 
able to compete at a college 
level is pretty signi?cant.” 
Her hard-working mental-
ity has steeled her and helped 
her earn second place in the 
high jump at the 2013–14 
UAA Indoor Championships 
and the 2015–16 UAA Indoor 
Championships. “That was 
really awesome.”
Looking ahead, Fortner 
is eager to get working for a 
good cause, leveraging her 
knowledge and dedication to-
ward helping as many people 
as she can. “I want to go into 
pharmaceuticals, anything to 
help people.”

Baseball, the sport long 
known as America’s pastime, 
is returning to the center stage 
of sports as basketball and 
hockey begin winding down. 
The 2017 MLB season began 
early this month, and as the 
season ?nds its groove, it’s 
time to consider some of the 
storylines to watch out for.
Can the Chicago Cubs win it 
all (again)?
The Curse of the Billy Goat, 
named after a tavern whose 
owner was forced to leave 
Wrigley Field due to the odor 
of his goat during Game 4 of 
the 1945 World Series, has 
been a thorn in the side of 
Cubs fans for decades.
In 2016, the Chicago Cubs 
?nally broke the curse, win-
ning their ?rst World Series 
in 108 years. Coming back 
from being down 1–3, they 
played a thrilling Game 7 in 
10 innings that will be re-
membered for a long time. But 
what about 2017? It’s a good 
possibility that the Cubs will 
make the playoffs and get the 
chance at a run for another 
championship.
Most of their key players, 
including Anthony Rizzo, Kris 
Bryant, and Ben Zobrist will 
be back, while the team as a 
whole is quite young. The ab-
sence of serious, tough compe-
tition in the National League 
Central division also helps 
the team’s chances. The Cubs 
have begun the season slowly, 
but the season is just getting 
warmed up.
Bryce Harper, MVP 2.0?
In 2015, Washington 
Nationals right ?elder Bryce 
Harper made good on his 
Rookie of the Year award from 
three years prior to win the Na-
tional League Most Valuable 
Player at 23, the youngest to 
do so by unanimous decision.
Harper had an absolutely 
mind-boggling year, with 118 
runs, 42 homers, and a .460 
on base percentage. The statis-
tics kept going: .649 slugging, 
198 OPS+, and 124 walks.
Harper’s 2016 season was 
not bad by any means, but sim-
ply looked subpar when com-
pared to his monster season 
the year before (and the high 
possibility he was dealing with 
injuries).
Now at 24, can Harper re-
turn to his 2015 form and lead 
the Nationals in challenging 
the Cubs?
Who is a contender?
Like all sports leagues, MLB 
is dominated by a few perenni-
ally good teams, along with a 
couple up-and-comers. The 
Cubs are a team built to last. 
Who is up there with them?
The Boston Red Sox has 
a young group in their stout 
offense, and their bullpen is 
complete with Craig Kimbrel. 
Others include the Cleveland 
Indians, the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, the Nationals, and 
the New York Mets. Don’t 
count out the young New York 
Yankees and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, who are looking to 
bounce back after a down year 
in 2016. All that’s certain is 
that there will be a surprise.

On working over Carnival
Dear Ruth,
IT’S FINALLY CARNIVAL. Carnival is the only thing 
I have to look forward to after Spring Break, so 
I’ve been patiently waiting for this moment ever 
since we got back. It’s less than a week away now 
and I’m. So. Ready. Or so I thought. My professors 
might be out to get me, because I somehow have 
to execute a group project during the greatest 
weekend of the year! It’s really not fair, but I 
guess we could’ve started sooner (but I mean we 
all knew that wasn’t going to happen).
I don’t know what to do. There’s so much I want 
to see and experience! The buggy races are so 
exciting, and I even have friends to cheer for 
this year! And the booth theme is great. I heard 
there’s going to be a Taco Bell booth... and I 
really, really love Taco Bell. I also bought a 
Carnegie State fanny pack to go with my outfit for 
the block party! If I’m stuck inside working on a 
group project all weekend, what do I even do with 
my fanny pack? Wear it in the library? And what 
do I do with my line-up of cute-but-comfortable 
block party looks? Wear them to Au Bon Pain? 
That’s ridiculous.
Part of me just really wants to throw in the towel, 
forget about my group project, forget about the 
inevitable doom that is finals week, and party 
with my friends until I forget my Numerical 
Methods exam ever happened. But the more 
responsible and less self-destructive part of me 
knows I should probably do my assignments. And, 
to make matters worse, I’ll feel really bad if I let 
my entire group down. I don’t want to be that one 
group member that brings the team down because 
I bailed last minute on the group meeting. I’d feel 
way too guilty to even enjoy the parties I went to. 
Should I just make all of them ditch the project, 
too? Should I convince the entire class to boycott 
the project? You know what they say, “He can’t 
fail all of us, right?”
What do I do? I’m really feeling the convince the 
whole class to boycott the class method, but let me 
know what you think. Think about the fanny pack!
Sincerely,
Panicking And Really Tense #YOLO”
Dear PARTY,
You do the assignment. (Sorry not sorry! You can 
wear the fanny pack while you do it, if that helps.)
For some reason, whenever a professor assigns 
something to be due right after Carnival, it’s 
always worth way too much of your grade. (Is it 
a conspiracy...?) And I’m going to assume here 
that you do actually want to pass your classes, 
because if you don’t then.... I dunno, drop out and 
have Carnival 24/365? But assuming you don’t 
want that, then you’re going to have to do the 
project. Especially because it’s a group project. 
“He can’t fail all of us” is the death knell of your 
grade. And you really don’t want to be that guy 
that gets way too lit over Carnival and doesn’t do 
any work on the project. (And if someone else in 
your group is that? See the March 27 edition of 
this column.)
The key is in how you schedule.
Basically everything that isn’t a university 
organized meet-and-greet happens 5 p.m. or later. 
Even if you were out until 4 a.m. the night before, 
you can probably drag yourself up and out of bed 
by noon. Over four days, that’s about 20 hours of 
“work” time available to you. Even if your group 
members aren’t working on the same schedule as 
you, I presume they also want a decent grade on 
the project and that they’ll put in the necessary 
time as well. (Group project tip to end all group 
project tips: If you don’t absolutely need to meet 
in person, Google Drive is your new best friend. 
Call up whoever used to emotionally support you 
and tell them you’re dropping them for that sweet, 
sweet multi-user functionality.) Basically, it’s your 
time to become a CMU superhero — student by 
day, party animal by night.
It’s going to maybe suck a little, and I know we 
all wish we had planned ahead enough that we 
could just sleep, Netflix, and party all of Carnival, 
but you’re in the same boat as a lot of the rest of 
us. And, if worst comes to worst and you have to 
work while midway is open, well, you can always 
pop out for a funnel cake to reenergize.
You can get the best of both worlds,
Ruth
Shreeyagya Khemka | StaffwriterBar Buddies: Umami
A brand new bar buddy, another over-priced adventure to Lawrenceville
The previous writers of this section were somewhat 
unavailable this weekend, so I, very excitedly 
I might add, took on the mantle of being your 
bar buddy this week. After getting a “hell no” 
to my idea of reviewing William Penn Tavern, I 
went out to grab a drink with a couple of friends 
in Lawrenceville, at an Izakaya (Japanese Pub) 
called Umami.
The Location: Umami is located off Butler Street 
surrounded by many other bars and attractions, 
and the area is happening but not too loud. I don’t 
think there are any good ways to get there by bus 
— your best bet is to drive or uber there.
The Drinks: The best word to describe the drinks 
at Umami would be “interesting”. The drinks all 
reconcile with the theme of the restaurant — that 
of celebrating Umami (savory) flavors — and have 
names such as “#GodzillaTears” and “Panda 
Panda Panda”.
I had a drink that was off their regular menu and 
was primarily a combination of Suntori whiskey 
and yuzu. I wouldn’t normally put whiskey and 
yuzu together, but I enjoyed a break from the 
normal and delighted in having the opportunity 
to savor a novel drink. My friends tried the Tickle 
‘n Giggle, which consisted of Pop Rocks, Leblon 
cachaça, basil, coconut lemongrass nigori, and 
lime. Again, the drink was rather out-of-the-box, 
but it was less sucessful. They didn’t enjoy the 
drink, which they said tasted like everything and 
nothing, but had a lot of fun eating the Pop Rocks 
that came with it.
The drinks were all between $9 and $12, so not 
terribly expensive. You probably don’t want to go 
here to have a regular cocktail, but if you’re in the 
mood for trying something new, this is definitely 
the place.
The vibe: Umami has the vibe of a modern 
Japanese restaurant — it supposedly also has 
amazing sushi, which, being a vegetarian, I can’t 
comment on. It’s dimly lit with red lights thrown in 
certain places giving it a very dark anime kind of 
vibe. Once you enter, you have to climb up two 
flights of stairs to walk up to the bar. 
The bar was full (possibly because it was a Friday 
night), but there were tables around the open 
kitchen, which is where my friends and I sat. The 
music was good, but they didn’t play it too loud. 
The place as a whole was conducive to having a 
chill but meaningful conversation with a couple of 
your friends.
Lit or nah: It was definitely lit, but in a very adult, 
“I want to sit, have a drink or two, and talk to my 
friends” kind of way. If you want a break from 
your traditional Pittsburgh bar scene, and try 
something new, you should definitely give Umami 
a shot.

CMU’s KSA and University of Pittsburgh’s 
FRESA bring K-pop to the masses
I’m not one who listens to K-pop often. In fact, I 
don’t think I’d ever even listened to a single K-pop 
song before attending the Carnegie Mellon K-pop 
Dance Club’s (KPDC) Showcase: Checkmate 
event. I do, however, have a lot of friends who 
love the genre. It was because of my curiosity 
and wanting to know what all the hype was about 
K-pop that I decided to go to the event. The event 
was KPDC’s very first showcase, designed to 
share the dances club members had been working 
on all semester.
The show included performances by a variety of 
KPDC dance troupes, along with two  
performances featuring the dance group FRESA 
from the University of Pittsburgh and KSA from 
Carnegie Mellon, all performing both song and 
dance covers to the music of popular K-pop artists 
such as BTS, GFRIEND, and Red Velvet. 
The set list featured a truly dizzying array of 
K-pop songs. Different Asian foods were being 
sold throughout the performances by other stu-
dent organizations, including Carnegie Mellon’s 
ARCC, Taiwanese Students Association, and LiNK,  
making the entire event a fun and exciting cultural 
learning experience.
What I found most fascinating were the outfits 
that the performers in each group wore. Before 
the show started, I’d seen some performers going 
over last minute things in the hallway, and it was 
amazing to see how vibrant some of their outfits 
were. Some wore very bright floral dresses, while 
others even dyed their hair purple, bright red, 
and rainbow. I also noticed that solid colors were 
a common choice for almost all of the outfits, 
making the performers pop. From bright red shirts 
with plain white bottoms to outfits that were com-
pletely grey, there was variety in how everyone 
was dressed.
Once the performances began, the audience 
was able to see how all clothes from each group 
fit into their performance. For example, in the 
dance performance of “1 Step 2 Step,” by K-pop 
girl group Oh My Girl, the outfits worn were all 
bright white and blue to fit the very cute and 
sweet theme of the song. Comparing those outfits 
to those from the performance for “Boom Boom,” 
by K-pop boy band Seventeen, the dancers wore 
black bomber jackets and much darker colors for 
the cooler and more hardcore feel of that song.
I was very impressed by all the dancers and 
singers in the show, and it was clear that every-
one who participated gave their best efforts. 
Specifically, the dancers started at very different 
levels of experience, but once the groups got on 
stage you couldn’t even tell the difference. Almost 
all of the dance numbers were fast paced and 
seemed very complex, but the performers were 
all in sync and pulled everything off. 
Overall the event was a fun time for both the per-
formers and audience members. Although being 
exposed to K-pop culture was a very new experi-
ence for me, I definitely enjoyed it, and I will try 
listening to more of the genre in the future.

Spice IslandMarika Yang | Assistant Sports Editor
When a friend and I decided to grab dinner 
and catch up, we were pressed with a seri-
ous predicament: where should we eat? The 
various communities around Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus — Oakland, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, 
the Strip District — are overflowing with restau-
rants of all different types of cuisine, almost too 
many to choose from. After we narrowed down 
our options to Oakland, we finally decided 
on Spice Island Tea House, a restaurant down 
Atwood Street.
Spice Island Tea House is a little hole in the wall 
a short walk down Atwood. We almost passed 
it without realizing. The restaurant has a rustic, 
homey feel, with succulents growing freely in the 
display case, wooden walls, floors, and furniture. 
The place is entirely decorated in earth tones. We 
were there in the afternoon, during the lull period 
between lunch and dinner, and were the only 
people seated, which is rather rare in Oakland.
Founded in 1995, Spice Island Tea House spe-
cializes in all things Southeast Asian, blending 
flavors from Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, and Singapore. The menu is filled with 
many diverse options, including salads, fried rice, 
noodles, curries, specialties grilled or stir-fried, 
and vegetable dishes. As indicated by the name, 
the restaurant has an extensive loose tea list, with 
choices of black, green, oolong, herbal, fruity, 
and scented teas. It also offers an array of alco-
holic and non-alcoholic beverages.
The place is casual, and the service very quick 
and efficient. We immediately felt comfortable 
and before long, our food had arrived.
The Burmese Barbecued Chicken Thighs in yogurt-
curry marinade was absolutely delicious. The 
chicken was very tender and juicy, and the mari-
nade had a good balance of sweet and savory. 
All of the grilled and stir-fry dishes were served 
with steamed white rice and a side salad, which 
wonderfully complemented the chicken. The salad 
was very refreshing, and surprisingly sweet.
The Ever-Famous Pad Thai, however, left some-
thing to be desired. A good pad thai is a perfect 
mixture of sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and 
spiciness from the many different flavors. Made 
with stir-fried rice linguine, chicken, shrimp, bean 
sprout, egg, and crushed peanuts, Spice Island 
Tea House’s pad thai definitely had the sweet-
ness component, but little else. While the overall 
taste was still good, it didn’t have the elements 
that make pad thai unique: the hint of spice, the 
pop of sweetness, the zesty lemon. The peanut 
taste was overwhelming, making every bite taste 
the same.
Since this is a tea house, we decided to try the 
tea of the day, Mango Indica Tea, a black tea 
with mango flavor. It was very good — not too 
sweet, not too bitter, and quite hearty.
Spice Island Tea House is wide-ranging, ensur-
ing that there is something for everyone. It offers 
quality, authentic Southeast Asian food in large 
portions at a decent price. To top it off, it’s only 
a short walk or trip on the bus from campus. 
Just steer clear of the clichéd pad thai, and you 
should be fine. A step above the ubiquitous cheap 
Chinese take-out, it’s a nice restaurant to try 
something new.

BXA Student 
Showcase
There were 22 students in Carnegie Mellon 
University’s BXA Intercollege Degree Programs 
(BXA) that performed and showcased their creations 
and exhibits to the public in the College of Fine Arts 
building Wednesday, April 12 as part of the BXA 
Student Showcase. 
The event was the first of its kind in the history of 
BXA. Traditionally, BXA students students share 
their inventive projects that synthesize diciplines 
from all across campus in an annual event called 
Kaleidoscope. Instead, this year Amanda Branson, 
a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Humanities and Arts 
in decision science and music performance, hosted 
the BXA Student Showcase as part of her senior 
capstone.
The BXA Student Showcase is part of Branson’s 
senior capstone project, a required project of BXA 
seniors where students create work that reflects their 
curricula and learning over their college career.
“You can see, through the eyes of the artists, what’s 
important to them with the exhibits,” Branson said. 
“I hope that the Student Showcase helps empower 
others to succeed through seeing the works of oth-
ers.” Branson also participated in the showcase, giv-
ing a commencement speech and performance.
Six other students held performances in the Kresge 
Theatre. 
The performances ranged from the delightful and 
quirky, such as junior Bachelor of Science and 
Arts in chemistry and music performance student 
Valerie Senavsky’s Who Needs a Cello to Play the 
Cello Song, to the emotive, such as Bachelor of 
Humanities and Arts in technical writing and music 
technology junior Joshua Brown’s dance perfor-
mance Voodoo Bag. 
Dante Horvath, a senior pursuing a Bachelor of 
Humanities and Arts in linguistics and music per-
formance, performed four Hungarian folk songs 
by Zoltan Kodaly. This performance was a great 
example of the essence of showcase and the BXA 
Intercollege Degree Programs as a whole, with 
Horvath synthesizing his two interests into one cohe-
sive work. Horvath’s family’s Hungarian heritage 
was channeled throughout the four pieces, and not 
only showcased Horvath’s work during his time at 
Carnegie Mellon but his personality as well. All of 
the performances were recorded and are available 
for viewing on the event’s Facebook page, BXA 
Student Showcase.
Across the hall in the Alumni Concert Hall were 15 
visual exhibits, including a diverse range of media 
from computer programs to sculptures and paint-
ings. Complete with a reception, the Showcase 
structured the Alumni Concert Hall so attendees 
could walk around the exhibits at their own lei-
sure and fully embrace the artwork of the students 
involved.

Damasco’s Wick editor were two of the computer 
programs featured at the exhibit. Choi’s “Hugging 
Robot”, inspired to be his own “robot butler,” gave 
surprisingly good hugs and could even move on 
its own. An Xbox controller was also wired to the 
robot to make it easier to control. Damasco’s Wick 
editor is a multimedia creation tool that helps cre-
ate websites that would require a lot of coding in 
mere seconds, and showcased various programs 
made with Wick throughout the exhibit. In classic 
Carnegie Mellon BXA fashion, these exhibits chal-
lenged and blurred the distinction between innova-
tion and art. 
A junior pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science 
and Arts in computer science and music technol-
ogy, Sara Adkins also used technology as a 
springboard for her art, but her project showed the 
other side of what technology and art can do. Her 
“RobOrchestra”, a series of robotic arms playing 
musical instruments, could be heard throughout the 
hall. The robot’s music, which was light-hearted and 
fun, matched the playful nature of the project and 
brought smiles to a lot of faces.
A junior pursuing a Bachelor of Business and Arts 
in global systems and management and art, Grace 
Wong featured her photo book entitled “Numbness: 
Rituals for Self-Preservation,” a striking collection 
that not only revealed aspects of her own per-
sonality but also encouraged visitors to examine 
their own. 
Sophomore pursuing a Bachelor of Humanities and 
Arts in decision science and art, Daniel See not only 
showcased his project, but also put it for sale. See 
featured cups made by those affected by homeless-
ness in Pittsburgh, selling each cup for $20 and 
using his project and the Showcase as a greater 
outlet for activism and awareness. His project was 
also featured in an art show on homelessness in 
Pittsburgh earlier this year.
Junior pursuing a Bachelor of Humanities and Arts 
in anthropology and art, Madeline Quasebarth’s 
“Meatsacks,” a collection of five photos of differ-
ent body parts, was intricate and striking, standing 
out against its display. Senior Joni Sullivan, who is 
pursuing a Bachelor in Humanities and Arts in psy-
chology and art, had two pieces, “Welcome Home” 
and “Pool Party,” which were bright and colorful, 
bringing a fun vibe to the Student Showcase.
The BXA Student Showcase succeeded in bringing 
together the Carnegie Mellon community through 
the artwork of others and helping departing BXA 
seniors celebrate their successes, and it has all the 
promises of becoming a new annual tradition for the 
BXA programs.

The Frame: Textually Active
Artists around the country are reflecting on the 
reverberating impact of the election and increasing 
social tensions, most recently reflected in the 
work and controversy that arose in the 
Whitney Biennale. This semester 
has brought us, here 
at Carnegie Mellon, 
a season of art at the 
Frame Gallery that 
shows the different ways 
that students have been 
responding to the politi-
cal climate. This Sunday 
marks the close of senior art 
major Jarel Grant’s solo show 
Textually Active, the Frame’s 
2017 Grant Show.
Grant describes Textually Active 
as an exploration of what it 
means to be in a “post-racial 
America,” diving into the contradic-
tion between the era the Obama 
presidency was meant to create and 
the rising hostility towards minor-
ity groups in America since then. 
Walking through the space is a 
vibrant and precise visual experi-
ence. Upon entering, the viewer 
is greeted by a large American 
flag hanging from the ceiling 
made of black and white fab-
ric. It backdrops a wooden 
desk on which a collection 
of objects is placed around 
a poem printed in the 
center. The text describes 
a sense of history and 
family, establishing 
a tension between 
personal history and 
political circum-
stance. This instal-
lation ties together 
the entire show, 
with the rep-
etition of the 
American flag motif 
and symbolic nature of the 
colors established within this scene. 
“I voted” sticker patterns are printed on 
posters and the wall and a patriotic color palette 
is used in large-scale, layered text pieces.
I went to this show twice: once during the open-
ing, once the weekend after. The energy each time 
was drastically different, but in combination both 
experiences reveal the tone of the exhibition. The 
opening had an energy of exuberance and celebra-
tion, with lively music and people dancing as they 
wandered through the space and interacted with 
the artist. The second weekend was quieter, and 
the soft, reflective quality of the work became more 
pronounced. The brightly colored zine displays and 
the larger text pieces are not like the easy, political 
messaging of graphic artists in the ‘80s. Despite 
the political context the installations establish, the 
poems and text are told through personal narratives 
of boyhood and blackness, contrasting the idealism 
and adventure of growing up that sits with more 
somber realities of race in America.
The impact of Grant’s work comes from influences 
of both graphic works and poetry. Grant described 
this as his favorite challenge, “finding the balance 
between being simple but also having another ele-
ment of complexity” through language. Simplicity 
with precision of play with language and cultural 
codes drives works such as “The Boys in #0047ab 
and The Boys In Blue Collars.” This piece involves 
layering of colored letters that combine the imagery 
of celebration and boyhood with references to the 
police. The blocks of red, white, and blue and layer-
ing of letters requires the viewer to work to decode 
the meaning. The effort that goes into understand-
ing the work is important because the show is about 
building a cultural language through color idioms 
and cultural references.
The importance of color in the language of the 
exhibition comes from several sources. Two of the 
most influential are the Black Lives Matter and Blue 
Lives Matter movements. Grant says “The book 
‘Blue Streaks in Black Matter’ is based on the van-
dalization of a Black Lives Matter sign (which was 
changed to Blue Lives Matter) outside the Unitarian 
Church on Morewood.” From there, he began to 
play with the expressions involving color and to 
pull new meaning from them. Certainly, it is easy 
to see the attention and thought that was put into 
connecting color to language to visuals — nothing 
in this show feels accidental. “Blue Streaks in Black 
Matter” includes few words. The poems are short 
but rich and the colors of text and paper interact to 
expand the meaning of the words.
For the viewer who does not identify with the narra-
tor of the story, the fact that every part of the work 
and curation is carefully considered is important. 
Not all viewers will understand each reference or 
experience abstracted through poetry. Foreign lan-
guage learners will tell you that idioms can be the 
hardest thing to pick up, and much of the audience 
of Textually Active are sort of foreign language 
learners within the show, thrust into a perspective 
they were not born into. The show works because 
the care with which each visual and verbal decision 
was made applies a sense of value which the viewer 
is obligated to reciprocate. The viewer who does 
not share these experiences must unpack their own 
cultural language and, most importantly, slow down 
and listen.
Grant describes his process in part as being a 
massive research effort. Processing the idea of 
“post-racial America” by reading works from black 
writers such as James Baldwin, Gil Scott Heron, and 
Countee Cullen, he searched to understand what it 
meant to be a black creator and writer. To do so, 
he had to look at his own past. The color symbolism 
reflects this, yellows and blues refer to cultural icons 
as well as personal associations with street lights 
and water respectively. The olive green refers to a 
“nourishing sheen spray” for natural hair, and the 
white to racial majority but also baptism and vans. 
The language and color symbolism moves between 
memories of growing up and the larger context that 
the artist grew up in.
“The personal is the political” is a phrase coined by 
second wave feminist Carol Hanisch, which was fol-
lowed by much debate surrounding the idea of iden-
tity politics. The concerns with identity politics are 
often about the issue of reducing someone’s whole 
experiences to a political prop or label. Artists often 
talk about their experiences to relate to broader 
ideas, but artists of marginalized groups often 
experience this issue when their work is reduced to 
just their identity label without nuance. For artists 
of color, a challenge is then to preserve personal 
nuance when presenting to an audience that is likely 
to be mostly white. This is the twofold challenge 
of art activism; fighting an unjust society and also 
working with a visual language that was built by 
and for the dominant group.
The intelligent and culturally aware language in 
Textually Active is able to navigate this problem by 
separating personal narrative and abstract societal 
issues, while also pointing to the ways they are con-
nected. The audience reads the work from the per-
spective of the artist first, sees the person behind the 
words, and then works outward to the society he is 
placed in. The poems, text, and visuals do indeed 
work with activism and serious issues in our society, 
but the exhibition is also a celebration of beauty 
and self through precision of language. Textually 
Active is the strong beginning of Grant’s work of 
activism through empathy as he continues to explore 
storytelling and works to honor the experiences of 
African-American communities.

In 1979, Pink Floyd put out their magnum 
opus, one of the most successful rock albums 
ever, going Platinum in the U.S. and U.K, and 
giving them their first number one single. A 
grand rock opera, its scale was matched only 
by its singular vision. This was The Wall, 
the one Pink Floyd album everyone knows 
and loves. Well, The Wall had a darker, 
messier, and less polished but equally bril-
liant elder sibling, Animals. The sheer size 
of The Wall’s shadow ensures that Animals 
has always remained the unappreciated 
genius in the Pink Floyd canon. Fans swear 
by it, and the rest of the world has hardly 
heard of it. In these strange political times, 
Animals makes for a remarkably prescient 
record.
The concept of the album is adapted from 
George Orwell’s Animal Farm. The only differ-
ence is that, where Orwell uses the animal arche-
types to reflect the death of the Tsarist autocracy 
and the eventual emergence of Stalinism in Russia, 
Pink Floyd flips the metaphor to reflect on what 
it believes is a ruthlessly Capitalist 1970s Britain. 
Hence, in Floyd’s Animals, the sheep are the poor 
gullible masses, the dogs are ruthless hustlers, and 
the pigs are an extravagant and disgusting politi-
cal class.
The entire album is composed of a short prologue 
and epilogue bookending three massive fifteen-
minute songs, unambiguously titled “Dogs,” “Pigs 
(Three Different Ones),” and “Sheep.” The entire 
album’s lyrical content is very direct. The words, 
while laden with emotion, don’t leave much room 
for creative interpretation. All the subtlety and 
nuance is reserved for the sound itself — dark, 
gritty, industrial, and brimming with meaning, 
yet hidden beneath countless interpretations and 
hours of listening.
Throughout Animals, Roger Waters, the bands 
bassist, vocalist, and chief songwriter for the 
purposes of this album, channels his own build-
ing nihilism and disillusionment with society to 
produce a biting critique of capitalism and the 
Western democratic system as a whole. When 
one examines the ideas and feelings that Waters 
alludes to throughout, the record feels eerily 
relevant in 2017. To hear Waters sing about the 
Pigs, “You’re nearly a laugh / You’re nearly a 
laugh / But you’re really a cry,” one can’t help 
but be reminded of our turbulent times. His politi-
cal vision and his fearless delivery of it are what 
make Animals worth revisiting today. Late last 
year, a group of Chicago architects proposed a 
plan involving the blocking of the Trump Tower 
Chicago logo with gold balloon pigs, a direct 
reference to the pig floating between two of the 
chimneys of London’s Battersea Power Station on 
the cover of Animals.
With that said, enough with the foreshadowing! 
Here are the songs:
“Dogs”:
As the first of the albums three long tracks, 
“Dogs” sets an aggressive, hungry, dark, and 
direct tone for the album. It traces the sad and 
lonely life of the ruthless entrepreneur. He starts 
out as a keen-eyed street hustler, before graduat-
ing to becoming a polished executive. He has one 
goal — to get ahead — and he picks out suckers, 
compromises his morals, and betrays his friends in 
its pursuit. Over time, as he gets older and starts 
needing care, and he comes to the horrifying 
conclusion that he has made no real connections 
in his entire life. He eventually dies of can-
cer, sad and alone. In his final moments, he 
questions the system he did so much to thrive 
within, and comes to believe the system was 
exploiting him for its benefit all along. Waters’ 
tone within “Dogs” is withering disgust. He 
concludes with “Who was ground down 
in the end / Who was found dead on 
the phone / Who was dragged down 
by the stone.” 
“Pigs (Three Different Ones)”:
Rogers taunts the pigs differently than 
he does the dogs. With the dogs, he 
condescends, mirthlessly ridiculing their 
lives. With the pigs, he engages in sat-
ire. “Haha, charade you are” he sings, 
making fun of pigs for their laziness, clum-
siness, and remarkably shallow sense of 
false dignity. However, even the laughter rings 
hollow, as it gradually dawns on a listener that 
the pigs are deeply tortured too. Rogers ultimate-
ly concludes the same thing — that for all their 
pomp and circumstance, the greatest joke on the 
pigs is that they are the saddest of all the animals. 
Musically, this song is the only one that borders 
on anything resembling positivity. The chorus actu-
ally sounds a little defiant and taunting, instead of 
just defeatist and dark.
“Sheep”:
As the poor downtrodden masses, the sheep are 
happily lost in their simplicity and innocence. They 
seem to believe that their overlords, the dogs and 
the pigs, are their righteous leaders. They blindly 
follow the dogs to the slaughterhouse, and a hor-
rible, painful death follows, beautifully depicted 
through one of guitarist Dave Gilmours most inno-
vative solos ever. On the one side, Waters seems 
to sympathize with the sheep, and on the other, 
he seems to recoil at their naiveté. There are allu-
sions to a desire to revolt, such as when the sheep 
speak of learning karate, and to the idea of reli-
gion, with the sheep seeming to find solace from 
their building misery in a higher power. Eleven 
minutes later, when the revolt finally comes and 
brings the album to its epic climax, the sheep rise 
up against the dogs, but not the pigs.

Why do we come together as a university to shove short  
people in small spaces? How did we get from rolling  
shopping carts down a hill to the hyper engineered fiberglass  
vehicles we know and love today? Buggy was founded in 
1920 and became a part of the Carnival festivities, which 
began in 1914. Formally known as Sweepstakes, Buggy 
brings together organizations from around campus to race on 
Tech Street. There are currently eleven active buggy  
organizations on campus.
With Buggy being around for almost a century now, there 
have been dramatic changes in the designs of the vehicles, 
the rules of the race, and the spirit that surrounds it. Here are 
some interesting historical moments in Buggy history:
•The races were originally limited to fraternities, but in the 
1950s, men’s dorms began to participate as well.
•Up until 1981, all winning drivers were male.
•The brothers of Alpha Tau Omega brought an impressive 
streak after Delta Tau Delta (DTD), claiming victory nine out 
of ten years between 1953 and 1962.
•DTD conquered six out of seven years post-World War II.
•Prior to World War II, Kappa Sigma, a currently inactive 
team, was the top team on the track. Beta Theta Pi, also 
inactive, was a “distant second.”
•An accident during practice in 1971 brought about some 
of the stringent safety rules that we have today.
•Delta Upsilon was the first organization to launch a fully 
covered buggy, but the design was unstable and wrecked 
both in practice and while racing. It was soon outlawed. 
Rumor has it that the buggy was stolen after its last race in 
1988.
•The rules of the competition were completely rewritten 
after a fire in a fraternity truck in 1986.
•CIA became the first non-Greek organization to win 
sweepstakes in 1981.
•In recent history, Student Dormitory Council (SDC) has 
taken six titles in the last eight men’s races, and seven in the 
last ten for women’s.
•SDC holds the current record for time, with a whopping 
2:02.49 in the men’s category, set during the 2016 season.

The carnival concert this year will be held on Saturday, April 22, 
at 7 p.m. on the cut. The artists this year are NGHTMRE and San 
Holo, and it promises to be an event to remember. The carnival con-
cert, more than anything, is a time for the campus community to get 
together and let loose, with music and (hopefully) beautiful weather. 
It’s free for all students and definitely worth the experience.
Rides and Games
Where: The Cut
When: All weekend
What would a carnival be without rides? Carnegie Mellon’s 
Carnival is no different. Buy individual tickets or a day pass 
and check out the classic Ferris Wheel, and a variety of 
other zany rides to make your weekend special. Don’t forget 
to check out some classic carnival games such as balloon 
shooting and try your luck to win some prizes.
Booths and Vendors
Where: The Cut and CFA Parking Lot
When: All weekend
Organizations from all over campus take the months leading up to carnival to carefully plan and craft one and 
two-story booths for carnival-goers to visit. Many of these booths include games and intricately detailed decora-
tions that impress visitors year after year and make up the heart of Carnival. Be sure to make your way over 
to the CFA lot to explore the “Timehop” theme booths this year, and check back here next week to see which 
booths take home awards for exceptional craftsmanship. Hungry? Some of these booths, along with vendors 
across the cut, will be selling everything from deep fried Oreo cookies to funnel cake.

One of the annual highlights of Carnival is the S’n’S musical. This year, the musi-
cal of choice is Heathers, which is probably best described as a classic ‘80s teen 
romance, at least until things start blowing up - both literally and figuratively. We rec-
ommend the 11 p.m. show if you want a hilarious and delightful experience, and any 
other show if you want a quiet audience. Tickets are $5 with student ID. Make sure 
to get your tickets ahead of time, because last year the shows sold out!

With past AB concerts bringing in art-
ists such as Walk The Moon, The Black 
Keys, and Matt and Kim, this years’ 
Spring Carnival concert is breaking new 
ground and bringing two underdogs of 
the House scene to campus.
Los Angeles based DJ Tyler Mareny, 
known by the stage name NGHTMRE, 
is coming to Pittsburgh right after he 
makes a stop at the Thingyan Music 
Festival in Myanmar. Mareny, who has 
been active since 2014, was born in 
Stamford, Conneticut, and grew up in 
Raleigh, North Carolina. An alum of 
Elon University and Icon Collective Music 
Production School, Mareny started his 
career making remixes of renowned 
artists such as Skrillex. Incidentally, 
NGHTMRE’s recognition began to 
flourish when Skrillex himself played one of NGHTMRE’s 
original tracks. Now the artist is touring music festi-
vals around the world, playing original and remixed 
tracks, mostly within the genres of trap and house 
music. NGHTMRE’s music carries a deep, perpetu-
ating, vibrating undertone to it, with obscured 
vocals and a rumbling base.
Since rising to fame, NGHTMRE has released an 
EP and collaborated with artists from throughout 
the EDM industry including Flux Pavillion, Zeds 
Dead, and Dillon Francis.
His accompanying act for the evening, San Holo, 
the stagename of Sander van Dijck, hails 
from the Netherlands, and has released 
music through some of the same labels that NGHTMRE 
has, including Monstercat. Van Dijck’s journey began at 
Codarts University of the Arts, after which he ghost pro-
duced for DJs around the Netherlands. His solo career 
took flight soon after and gave rise to a mix of remixes 
and original productions. San Holo has since been mak-
ing his mark on the EDM realm, with his first EP, Cosmos, 
making its way to the Top 100 Electronic list on iTunes.
We asked around, and not a lot of people on cam-
pus have heard of either act. With that in mind, here 
are some song reccomendations to get prepped 
for the concert.
This year’s Spring Carnival concert will take place on the 
cut, on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m, with the rain location 
stationed at Wiegand Gymnasium. Since this is likely to be a 
rainy Carnival, be sure to get your free tickets online

The Matsuri Festival included performances, food, pho-
tobooths, and games, all aimed at celebrating Japanese 
culture. It was put on by the Japanese Student Association 
and happened on Tuesday, April 11 from 4 to 6 p.m.  in the 
Rangos Ballroom. Matsuri festivals are traditionally a sacred 
ceremony of the Shinto religion in the form of street fairs. 
The purpose of the event was to give people a perspective 
on Japanese culture in a authentic light. Of all the things 
that happened at the event the most outstanding was the 
taiko performance. The taiko performance was a fantastic 
showcase reinventing the traditions of taiko music as they 
have been evolved by Japanese-Americans in the United 
States. The taiko performers were all from the community 
based music ensemble, Pittsburgh Taiko. All of the proceeds 
from the event are to be donated to  Minato Midle School in 
Ishinomaki, Japan, a school that lost their whole campus in 
the East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami on March 11, 2011.
