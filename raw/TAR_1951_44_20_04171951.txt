Carnegie Tech Kiltie Symphonic Band 
Spring Concert On Friday& * * » 
Kiltie Spring Concert 
Friday In Music Hall
Offering selections from the martial, classical, and modern mu* 
sical fields, the Carnegie Tech Kiltie Symphonic Band will present its 
annual Spring Concert on Friday, April 20th, at 8:15 p. m. in Car­
negie Music Hall. ?----------------------------------------------------
Under the baton of Mr. William
A. Schaefer, the Kilties will open 
with “Entry of the Gladiators.” 
The ‘-‘First Suite in E-Flat for | 
Military Bands” will round out 
the march music.
Wagner’s ‘Prelude to Dei 
Mejstersingers”, “The Sorcerer’s 
Apprentice” by Paul Dukas, “Final 
from Symphony in D-Minor” by 
Cesar Franck, and “Finale from 
Symphony No. 3” by Tschaikow- 
sky, with a special arrangement 
by Mr. Schaefer, have been chosen 
to represent the classical field.
In the modern vein, the band 
will offer Schuman’s “Newsreel 
in Five Parts” and “Mardi-Gras” 
from Ferde Grofe’s “Mississippi 
Suite”.
The Kiltie Symphonic Band, 
consisting of 97 members, has 
proved to be one of Carnegie’s best 
advertisements. It has demon­
strated that bands can play the 
best musical literature success­
fully. TTie group’s repertoire con­
sists of outstanding concert works 
and specially arranged selections 
for the exclusive use of the band.
Tickets for this performance 
Will cost 75 cents for adults.

Carnegie Inn 
On TSeiv Plan
Dorm Council Plans 
Post-Formal Breakfast
The Sunday opening of Carnegie 
Inn, urged several weeks ago by 
Dorm Council, has become official. 
The student center will be in use, 
on'the new schedule, from Sunday 
through Friday. The current hours 
will be maintained on all days, the 
grill opening at 4:00 p.m., the 
lounge at noon, and both closing 
at 10:30. The building will not be 
available at all on Saturdays.
DC stressed that the measure, 
although it will last for the re­
mainder of the semester, is merely 
a trial and will not be maintained 
if sufficient use of the Inn is not 
made under the new -system.
In connection with Council 
plans for Spring Carnival activi­
ties, there is a possibility that 
Claymore Clan will sponsor a 
breakfast following the formal. A 
poll will be taken among dorm 
men in the near future to see if 
this plan will reçeive enough re­
sponse to be practical. If so, the 
affair will be held at the Carnegie 
Union.
The spring picnic for dorm men 
has been set for May 19 at South 
Park. According to present plans, 
everything necessary, including 
transportation, will be provided 
by Dorm Council. This will be one 
of the two big dorm social events 
of the spring semester. The other 
was the semi-formal held last Fri­
day night.
Carnival Sweepstakes 
Have Rules Changed
Seven Prelim And Two Final Heats
Planned; Brakes Are Now Required
Major changes in this year’s Spring Carnival Sweepstakes race 
have been announced by Emerson Pugh, chairman of the Sweepstakes 
committee, for this year’s Carnival, May 10, 11, and 12.
With 14 buggies entered from the 12 fraternities, Citcom, and 
the Dorms, the Committee has^ -
Libraries Pass 100,000 Mark; 
Periodical Collections Growing
Separate Library Building Planned For Near
Future Will Occupy Part Of Upper Cut Area
Melvin J. Voigt, professor of library science at Carnegie, an­
nounced 'recently that the school’s libraries have passed the 100,000- 
volume mark. This represents a major milestone in the long range 
expansion and improvement program planned for the library facili­
ties at Carnegie Tech. ?--------------------------------------—------:----
In recent years the library has 
greatly increased its files of back 
issues of scientific and professional 
periodicals with a view toward 
providing more up-to-date ma­
terial for student research and 
study. Students, as in the past, 
will have free access to these new 
sources of information.
Space Limited
If the present rate of growth 
continues, the library will again be 
faced with the problem of space 
limitation. It is believed that this 
recurring difficulty will be solved 
completely when a separate libra­
ry building—now in the planning 
stages—becomes a reality. Pro­
posed site for the new building is 
the upper part of the cut adjacent 
to Webb Hall.
Esetimates of the cost such a 
building run close to $2,000,000— 
all of which must come from pri­
vate sources. At the present time 
nearly all of the library’s funds 
are used to maintain the present 
library system and buy the 15,000
new books which, on the average, 
are added each year.
A central library would help 
solve many of the problems now 
faced by the staff. An integrated 
system would make work easier 
for students and librarians alike; 
the additional space could be used 
to house a more complete cul­
tural and arts section.
Missing Books
Another problem, and a serious 
one, is causing even greater con­
cern. In recent months books have 
disappeared from the library in 
increasing numbers. In addition, 
many of the bound periodicals 
have been found with pages miss­
ing or otherwise mutilated. While 
a certain amount of this is in­
evitable, conditions have become 
such that some form of action must 
soon be taken if they do not im­
prove. Here again, a centrally 
controlled library, such as that 
planned for Carnegie, can do much 
toward bettering conditions.
(See editorial on Page 2)
decided to run seven heats with 
two buggies in each heat in the 
preliminaries instead jf four heats 
with three buggies and one uneven 
heat of two.
Another innovation will be the 
selection of the four fastest bug­
gies for the Saturday morning fin­
als, instead of only three as in past 
years. The finals will be run in 
two heats also, with the third and 
fourth fastest buggies from the 
preliminaries pitted against each 
other in the first race, and the 
two fastest buggies in the second 
race. The winner will be selected 
on the basis of the fastest time in 
the final heats, and will be an­
nounced at intermission time of 
the Saturday night formal dance.
Brakes Required
Delta Tau Delta copped its third 
consecutive victory in the sweep­
stakes race last year with a new 
course record of 2:41.8, although 
Kappa Sigma set an unofficial 
course record of 2:39 before be­
ing disqualified for an illegal 
change of pushers. Pi Kappa Alpha 
placed second last year for the sec­
ond straight year, while Delta Up- 
silon took the show position.
Design rules for judging the 
sweepstakes buggies will be the 
same this year, except that all 
buggies will be required to have 
brakes. Kappa Sigma and Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon have dominated this 
category for the past three years, 
with the former winning last year 
and three years ago, and the SAE’s 
winning first honors two years ago 
and finishing second in last year’s 
judging.
Practice Periods
Buggies will be allowed to prac­
tice on Schenley Drive from 11:00 
p.m. to 12:30 a.m. on Monday 
through Friday nights only, start­
ing April 30. Police protection will 
be provided at these times. Any 
organization who is caught prac­
ticing on this part of the course 
any other time will be disqualified 
from the event.
An added attraction to this 
year’s race will be the use of four 
walkie-talkie announcers spread 
out along the course. Controlled 
from a central broadcasting unit,
these on-the-spot announcers will 
bring a broadcast of the entire 
race to the spectators lined up 
along the course.

Editorials—
Something Lacking
What’s lacking in the class organizations—especially 
those of the sophomores and juniors? It seems to boil down 
to these possibilities: the ‘men for the job,’ as the posters 
said, just weren’t the men for the job; lack of student parti­
cipation; lack of funds; and poor lines of organization and 
communication.
Lack of funds is due to lack of student participation, and 
the latter is a result of poor communication and organization. 
It’s time to stop using the old catch-all of ‘people are too busy 
at Tech’ and recognize that students will find time to participate 
in any activity which they feel is worth while. But they won’t 
support a class organization which doesn’t know where it’s go­
ing and doesn’t even bother to keep the students informed.
How can we improve organization ana communication 
between students, officers, and classes? (1) Make the class 
presidents members of Student Council, thus bringing in­
competence and inertia to the attention of the students. (2) 
Put into practice the clauses of the class constitutions call­
ing for student cabinets to work with officers. (3) Find bet­
ter means of communication between the students and their 
officers. (4) Hold joint meetings among the officers of the 
different classes, as is now being done.
A class office should be a responsibility and not another 
‘honorary’ that means no work but which looks good on a 
job application.
It’s Your Library
There is nothing so important to any college campus as 
a well-stocked, well-kept library. Carnegie is fortunate in 
having a library which is continually expanding and improv­
ing the facilities which are so necessary for student study,
research, and recreation.
In recent months there has been a large increase in the 
number of books missing from the library shelves. Not only 
that, but many bound periodicals have been found mutilated— 
pictures and articles cut out bodily. This latter evil is perhaps 
the worst, for many of the periodicals are back issues and can­
not be replaced.
It is impossible for the library to police every corner—in 
fact the library has no desire to persue such a policy. The 
only solution to the problem is for the students responsible 
for these conditions to realize that in taking material for 
their own personal use they are stealing from their fellow 
students.

Letters
Scot” Controversy Grows; 
SC Places Gripe B oxes
In Reply—
Under the “Letters” column elsewhere on this page, a 
student asks and answers a pertinent question: “Does the 
reputation of Harvard or of its students rest with the editors 
of the “Lampoon,” or that of M.I.T. with the cartoonists of 
the “Owl”? Of course not.”
We have no information on Harvard or M.I.T., but we 
did receive the following item from the campus newspaper 
of Rensselaer Polytechnic, another non-coed institution:
“The campus humor magazine, ‘The Pup’, will be prohibited 
from publishing further issues after the conclusion of the present 
term. Due to some complaints received from parents and presi­
dents of other colleges, the Dean of Students has informed the 
Editor-in-Chief of ‘The Pup' of the forthcoming ban.”
No one can deny that the reputation of a college de­
pends in large part on the opinions of parents and other edu­
cators. By the way, doesn’t M.I.T. publish “Voodoo” and 
not the Owl”?

Member of the A ~- oc¿a*ed College Press,
Editor, the Tartan:
Your January 16 issue contains 
an editorial concerning the Scot. 
The bold-face third paragraph says 
in part: “. . . . we sincerely hope 
(the Scot) is not setting the stand­
ards of other college magazines as 
its goal. We’ve often heard the 
comment that the Scot is mild 
compared to such magazines as the 
Cornell Widow, Ohio State Sun 
Dial, and others. This could prob­
ably be answered by saying that 
Carnegie Tech considers its stu­
dents just that much above the 
character of other colleges.”
Aside from syntax, of which it 
displays a disregard unusual even 
for the Tartan, this editorial, of 
which the above , sentences are 
typical, comprises a concatenation 
of confused thinking seldom found 
outside textbooks in sociology. It 
is based on several skillfully dis­
guised but none the less ridiculous 
hypotheses, which must be expos­
ed in all their inanity before it 
becomes too late to rescue what 
| remains of a free press from the 
Bowdlers and Comstocks into 
whose hands control of campus 
publication seems to have fallen.
Even to the prigs and the pur­
itans, your position must have all 
the appearances of absurdity. In 
the first place, the reputation of an 
institution is not, as you imply, 
determined by the character of its 
humorous magazine. Does the rep­
utation of Harvard or of its stu­
dents rest with the editors of the 
Lampoon, or that of M.I.T. with 
j the cartoonists of the Owl? Of 
! course not.
In the second place, it is admit- 
i tedly difficult to extract genuine 
wit or humor from miniscule var- 
! iations on a theme, already shop­
worn in the caves of the Neander­
thals, which forms so large a part 
of college magazine content. But 
surely you ignore the distinction 
between the quality of humor and 
its subject. It is not the matter, 
however monotonous, which 
should be criticized, but the mode 
of expression. The question is, or 
I ought to be, an aesthetic one.
Finally, you imply that the char­
acter of a student stands in inti- 
I mate relation to the character of 
' his reading matter. Disregarding 
the Kinsey report, which contra- 
! diets this flatly, it is barely con- 
i ceivable that a student might be 
i led towards one downward path 
1 or an other by some of the crudi- 
' ties in Henry Miller, or even by 
i the delicate lubricities of Sterne, 
j but will his morals be affected by 
I the cosmic ribaldry of Apuleius Or
Editor, the Tartan:
Whether Mr. Anonymous’ quib­
ble with the former Tartan staff 
member responsible for the edi­
torial in controversy is semantical­
ly correct, is unimportant. How­
ever, the controversy about the 
Scot which he has fanned anew 
is important, for it points up the 
general lack of understanding on 
campus about publication policy. 
Since without clarification such 
controversy can never be settled,
I would like to take this oppor­
tunity to state as clearly as possi­
ble the questions involved.
The policy of each publication is 
formulated in conformance with 
school publication policy by an 
editorial board composed of the 
editorial staff of the publication 
and student council publications 
chairman. Routine differences of 
policy are settled within the ed­
itorial board subject to Student 
Council review.
Occasionally, however, decisions 
are made which conflict with 
school policy. In such cases an at­
tempt is made to reconcile the 
differences by a review board com­
posed of the Dean of Students, the 
editor and business manager of 
the publication involved, student 
council publication chairman, and 
a representative from the Public 
Relations Office. If the question 
cannot be settled by the review 
j board, the final authority rests 
with the Dean of Students.
The primary question behind 
the continual controversies is not, 
however, the mechanics of hand­
ling policy differences. The con- 
’ troversial issue is just what con- 
J stitutes a policy difference between 
1 a publication and the school.
Although not explicit, the es­
sence of the formal publication 
j policy of the school answers this 
question: Any policy or action of 
a publication which is detrimental 
to the school is not consonant with 
the publication policy of the 
school. Since this, position of the 
school is entirely reasonable, the 
only valid differences of opinion 
on the justification of a particular 
policy will stem from the interpre-
j Aristophanes? None but the most 
literal of illiterates could regard 
this point of view as other than 
¦ fantastic. To the pure, sir, all 
things are pure.
In short, you are being inchoate, 
illogical, irrelevant, insincere, un- 
gramatieal, and totally unsemantic.
Yours truly,
(Name Withheld)
To the Students:
In a representative type of gov­
ernment, the problem of communi­
cation between representative and 
represented always arises. In order 
to solve this on our campus, Stu­
dent Council has placed boxes on 
campus where a letter stating any 
problem or suggestion affecting a 
number of students may be depos­
ited. Their locations are: Industries 
Hall, Engineering Hall, Fine Arts, 
Margaret Morrison, and Skibo. 
Council hopes that students will 
use a little judgement in picking 
problems or suggestions, for if 
they affect only one student their 
solution or merits are of no value 
to the student body.
When using thi£ means of com­
munication, please sign your name 
to the letter so that you may be 
contacted if the need arises. Your 
letter will be read by the Special 
Committee, and if it is on an im­
portant matter from which some 
good may come, it will be taken to 
Couucil for action.
Leonard. J. Hvizdos,
Chairman
Special Committee
tation of what policy is detri­
mental.
The interpretation that has been 
given is that any policy is unfav­
orable which arouses unfavorable 
public opinion or action against 
the school. Here a matter of judg­
ment enters—what will cause un­
favorable opinion? But plainly 
this is easily observed in most 
cases. The content of the Lampoon 
was sufficient to cause costly legal 
action against Harvard. Only a 
year ago, the content of a news­
paper feature article of one of our 
neighbor Pittsburgh colleges was 
sufficient to cause a flood of un­
favorable comment and a consid­
erable l<5ss in prestige. It takes 
only a few incidents such as these 
to establish fairly clear-cut stand­
ards.
The school and the publications 
must remember that the outcries 
of outraged mothers and fathers 
are always a powerful factor with 
which to account. Whether par­
ents should be outraged is not a 
question to be judged; the fact 
remains many are. As long as they 
object, the school and the publica- 
| tions must bow in deference to 
; them and the force of their opin­
ion.
Sincerely,
H. Justin Davidson, x i Publications Chairman.

Two Senior E &S Men 
Write S 'nS Production
Perhaps you’ve heard it said that this is the age of specialization. 
That may be true, but if you’re a member of Scotch ’n Soda Club, 
Carnegie Tech’s nationally famous musical drama society, you’ll have 
a hard time believing it. ?-----------------------------------------------------
Take the case of Bob Larimer 
and Fred Price. Together they 
have written the 1951 Scotch ’n
Soda production, “A Merry Chase.” 
Both are seniors in, of all schools, 
Engineering and Science. Larimer 
is a math major. Price is study­
ing electrical engineering.
This is their second Scotch ’n
Bob Larimer, who wrote the words 
and music to the songs in the 
show. At the age of ten he started 
taking piano lessons. After a while 
he began improving his own 
tunes. When he liked a tune he 
wrote words to it and so on.

The annual change in the Tartan sports staff is not an 
earth quaking event to most students on the Carnegie campus. 
The change in the nature of the sports pages occasioned by 
a new sports staff is so slight as to escape the notice of all 
except the more critical readers. However, to the . people 
who face for the first time the weekly task of editing and 
writing from one to three pages of sports coverage, the occa­
sion is time for serious thought as to the functions they are 
to fulfill, the problems they are to face, and the policy they 
are to pursue. -
The most obvious function of the sport staff of the Tartan is 
to provide coverage of sports events on the Carnegie campus, and 
it will be our policy to give as complete and factual coverage of 
all intramural and varsity sports activities as possible. A satis­
factory job, however, will not depend alone upon the sports staff; 
it will, in a large measure, require the cooperation of the students 
and coaches connected with Carnegie sports. It is our sincere 
hope that we can establish such cooperation so that no important 
part of the sports picture will be overlooked.
In connection with promoting sports coverage, the staff 
will be open at any time to constructive criticism. Helpful 
suggestions will be carried out whenever possible. At the

In an almost exact repetition of last year’s intra-city intramural 
basketball playoffs, the Pitt Dukes triumphed again over the Car­

who fell victim to the Dukes last year by a 57-52 tally, just couldn’t

support.
The other function of the sports department is that which 
is incurred in writing a column such as this. In making edi­
torial comment, it will be the aim of the sports staff to give 
recognition and credit where they are due and to offer sug­
gestion and criticism for the improvement of the sports pro­
gram at Carnegie when they are merited. However, these 
pages will not be used for the intimidation or disparagement 
of any individual or organization. We will recognize the re­
sponsibilities of the printed page as well as the privileges 
attendant with it.
We sincerely hope to avoid unjust criticism in our editorial 
comment and incomplete coverage in our reporting. If we do 
make mistakes, and we’re human, we will be glad to admit them 
publicly. Your criticism of our performance is invited, for it is 
only through such criticism that we can remedy our mistakes.

could gather only 5 out of a pos- 
*sible total of 27 points. However, 
in the high and broad jumps, 
which were not held because of 
the condition of the track, the 
Skibos are expected to show more 
strength.
Coach Guy Halferty’s Tartans 
completely outclassed the Harriers 
of Jeannette in the track events 
as they swept all but two first 
places in the mile and two-mile 
runs. Gordon of the Harriers turn­
ed in a double win as he showed 
his heels to Bob Carman, who fin­
ished close behind for the Skibos 
in Both events.
Long Dash
The Carnegie speedsters were 
especially impressive in the 100, 
220, and 880 runs as they took all 
three places in each event. In the 
100 yard dash, which was later
discovered to be 115 yards, Johnny 
Luchok walked off with the rib­
bon in the rather commendable 
time of 11.7 considering the dis­
tance and the condition of the 
track.
• In perhaps the best time of the 
day, Skip Mitchell, second in the 
100, clipped off the 220 in 24.2 
followed by Bill McKibbin and 
Don Wood. In the 880 Douglas, 
Alexander, and Hursen finished 
one, two, three in 2:11.1.
Meet Case Sat.
Connie Hamman was the only 
double winner for the Scots as he 
took the high hurdles in 14.4 and 
barely nipped Thomas of Jean­
nette at the wire in the lows in 
13.2. In the quarter-mile run Fred 
Price came through with another 
first while Dick Englehart was fin­
ishing third.
The Tartans will open the regu­
lar season with a meet at Case 
on Saturday, April 21. The Rough 
Riders defeated the Skibos in a 
closely contested meet at the bowl 
last year, and Coach Halferty’s 
men will be out for revenge in 
what should prove to be hard- 
fought contest.
in a fast-played contest on the 
Skibo Gym floor last Monday.
Emanon jumped off to a good 
start and held an early three point 
margin over the Dukes at the end 
of the first quarter. However, the 
Pittsters began to find the range 
in the second quarter as they out- 
scored Emanon by eight points and 
left the floor at the half with a 
comfortable 18-13 lead.
Switch Defense
The Emanon team continued to 
do no better in the third quarter 
as the Dukes refused to be slowed 
down. Led by their center, Wein­
stein, high point man for the 
evening, the Pitt champions con­
tinued to build up their lead.
In the final quarter Emanon 
pulled up as they rallied to out- 
score their opponents. Forced out 
of their zone defense because they 
were behind, the “No Names” 
switched to a man-to-man and 
found themselves doing much bet­
ter as they cut down their oppon­
ents lead. The rally fell short, 
however, as the final horn sound­
ed with the Dukes on the long end 
of a nine point margin.
Clean Game
The game throughout was ex­
ceptional because of good officiat­
ing and the clean play and sports­
manship. Nobody was ejected 
from the game via the personal 
foul route, a rather marked dif­
ference from last year’s contest 
between the Dukes and the Em5n- 
on which was highlighted by fouls 
and fist fights.

Soccer, Pool To Start 
Campus Competition
Two more intramural sports began their season on the Carnegie 
campus Monday, one of them, pool, a newcomer to the intramural 
scene. For the first time pool will be played as a part of the in­
tramural program.
Twelve organizations have en­
tered sixteen teams in the green- 
cushioned sport. Beta Sigma Rho 
practically assured itself of a team 
in the play-off spots as it entered 
four of the sixteen teams. The 
teams have been formed into three 
leagues—the Cue Ball, the Eight 
Ball, and the Scratch.
Soccer competition also began 
Monday as two leagues—the 
American and the National—of six 
and seven teams each were form­
ed.
On the basis of their past rec­
ords, Delta Tau Delta and Emanon 
rank as co-favorites to cop the
IM soccer championship. Both 
have met in the final playoff game 
the past two years with each team 
managing to win once. On the 
basis of the strong showing they 
have made in all sports this year 
the Emanon team, however, should 
be ranked as a slight favorite.
Both Emanon and the Delts 
might be surprised, however, by 
several of the teams in the Ameri­
can league. Alpha Tau Omega, 
Theta Xi, and the Dorm Dukes 
have yearly been strong contend­
ers for the title and might have 
just enough stuff this year to up­
set the favorites. N
Beavers W in Handball Crown 
With Undefeated Season Record
The Beavers emerged champions in the 
league as they finished the season with an undefeated record of 
six wins and no losses. The Beavers were the only team to complete 
the schedule of six games.
In second place with a three 
and one record on the basis of 
four games played with Delta Tau 
Delta. Tied for third and fourth
Emanon Captures Team Title 
In Intramural Foul Shooting
Bud Pellegrini Wins Individual Championship 
After Breaking Deadlock In Regular Round
Emanon added foul shooting to its growing list of intramural 
championships as it squeezed by Kappa Sigma on the margin of one 
charity toss in a hard-fought match. The “No Names” sank a total 
of 356 out of a possible 500 fouls while the Kappa Sigs could manage
-----------------------------—---------------------?a total of only 355 in a hard luck
loss.
YOURSELF!
The Delts weren’t far off the 
pace as they captured the third 
position with a total of 350. Fin­
ishing fourth with 329 was Theta 
Xi, while the Obelisks rounded 
intramural handball out the first five with a total of 
295. The Obelisk score was cut 
down, however, as they were 
missing a man in the second round 
of 50 tries.
In the regular round of 100 
Frank Witt and Bud Pellegrini 
tied for individual honors as they 
each hit 83. In a 50 throw play­
off, however, Pellegrini became in­
dividual champion for the second 
year as he looped 41 through to 
only 39 for Witt.

were Theta Xi and Alpha Tau

None of the other team played 
more than two games.
The only serious competition en­
countered by the Beavers during 
the season was afforded by the 
Phi Kaps and Alpha Tau Omega, 
who both held the Beavers to 2-1 
victories.

To acquain' the pledges of the 
various fraternities with other 
fraternity members, the pledge 
groups began to visit other campus 
fraternities last week. Each group 
will have had dinner at each house 
on campus by the end of the se­
mester.
Sponsored by the Inter-Frater- 
nity Pledge Council, this is the 
first time such a plan has been 
initiated on our campus.
Pledge Council has also under­
taken an activities book, describ­
ing CFP’s functions throughout 
the year. This book will be en­
tered in a nation-wide competi­
tion. Standards for the winning 
book have been set up by the Na­

in the Carnegie Union last Sun­
day.
This artist, a native of Pitts­
burgh, made her debut at the age 
of 14 while studying under Eugene 
Ysaye in Brussels, Belgium. At 
23, she made her first appearance 
as soloist with the Chicago Sym­
phony under Frederick Stock 
playing the “Malitiero Concert” 
and Chausson’s “Poems”.
Critics predicted a brilliant fu­
ture for the young violinist. Not 
only in her native country was 
she a success, but on the Continent 
her flawless technique, flexible 
command of tone, and her innate 
interpretive ability won her praise 
from audience and critics alike.

$3000 Grant 
For Molecule 
Study Received
The Research Corporation of 
New York has made a $3,000 giant 
to CIT in support of a research 
project being conducted in the 
school’s chemistry laboratories.
The project, under direction of 
Dr. Robert G. Parr, assistant pro­
fessor of chemistry, consists of 
fundamental research on the struc­
ture of molecules.
The Research Corporation made 
a grant of $2,000 for the same con­
tinuing project in December 1949.
Dr. Parr joined the Carnegie 
faculty in 1948. During World War 
II he served with the Office of Sci­
entific Research and Development, 
studying explosives and propellant 
burning. He is a former consult­
ant to the Navy Bureau of Ord­
nance.
At its last meeting Student Council approved several recom­
mended revisions of the by-laws but defeated the majority of those 
proposed. Discussion was raised about changing Scimitar qualifica­
tions. Wes Apple, chairman of the by-laws committee, recommended
on the whole only technical 
changes, constituted to clarify du­
bious interpretations.
Revisions of the by-laws must 
be approved by a two-thirds ma­
jority of the voting members of 
Council. After heads were counted 
it wras found that the necessary 
two-thirds approval could be sup­
plied only by a unanimous vote of 
the members present. In a few 
instances one or two dissenters de­
feated controversial proposals. 
Minor Changes 
Those recommendations which 
were approved were that the 
names of nominees to Council 
shall be published in the Tartan 
one week before the day of the 
elections, and that the organization 
and co-ordination of pre-game 
football rallies shall remain as a 
function of the social committee.
Scimitars petitioned Council to 
have its points qualifications low­
ered from 35 to 25 to encourage 
more students to apply. Discus­
sion was led by Fred Tonge, pres­
ident of Scimitars, who recom­
mended the change on the basis 
that the organization was not re­
ceiving enough applications to en­
able it to choose sufficient men to 
successfully carry on its activi­
ties.
Opposition!
Justin Davidson argued that an 
honorary should not lower its 
qualifications just to get members, 
but that the purpose of an honor­
ary is to give recognition to out­
standing students, and lowering 
the standards is defeating its pur­
pose.
The recommended changes were 
turned over to the points and 
keys committee for approval and 
are to be -further discussed at the 
next Council meeting.
On the recommendation of Dav­
idson, chairman of the publications 
committee, Council approved the 
new Tartan editors.

First Banquet In 1915 
Held Before Christmas
Since this is the Thirty-Sixth Annual Banquet of the Evening 
College of Engineering and Science of Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology it might be interesting to look in retrospect at some of the 
highlights that have made these banquets the fine and popular affairs 
that they are. ?----------------------------------------------------
The fiist banquet was held in rupted up to the present banquet. 1915 and, although there were
scarcely 100 men present, the im­
pact of this affair upon the social 
scene of Carnegie Tech evening 
campus was great enough to, give

Earlier banquets were held in 
December prior to the Christmas 
recess and the banquet committee 
usually had to set their plans in 
action at the beginning of the fall 
term of school. The pre-Christmas 
date was dropped in favor of the 
now popular spring (April) date 
about 1925.
The earlier banquets were much 
the same as today except the main 
speaker was chosen from the ad­
ministration or faculty group. The 
idea of bringing an off-campus 
speaker originated with Chester 
Biscup, and since that time it has 
become a popular feature of these 
evening schoo banquets.
Always Floor Show
Banquets have been held in the 
Hotel Schenley, Fort Pitt Hotel, 
Hotel Henry, Webster Hall, and 
the Roosevelt Hotel.
There has been as many as 500 
persons attending these banquets, 
and it has - become an affair at 
which old friends gather to renew 
friendship and enjoy an evening 
of fellowship, and new evening 
students make new friends.
A light and entertaining floor 
show has always been a feature 
of the banquets, and although the 
years keep passing by, the incen­
tive to keep staging these affairs 
remains with the Evening School 
Engineers who, with the aid of 
Evening Student Council, the 
Evening School Faculty, and the 
Carnegie Tech Administration, al­
ways manage to produce a ban­
quet that is tops in entertainment.
