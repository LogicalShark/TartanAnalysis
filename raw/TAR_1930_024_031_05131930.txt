Ruth Lieberman, a Junior in Mar­
garet Morrison, recently was elected 
president of the Women's Scholar­
ship Organization of Carnegie for 
the 1930-31 season. Miss Licbcr­
man, who ably filled the position 
of treasurer of the same organiza­
tion for the past year, was recently 
called by Mortar Board, women’s 
senior honorary. She was: also a 
¡¦member of Cwens, Women’s Sopho­
more Honorary. The remainder 
of the officers will be elected when 
the election returns of every wom­
en’s organization on the campus 
arc complete. The president of each 
of these organization's automatic­
ally becomes a member of the Women’s Scholarship organization, 
upon her election to office.The Women’s Scholarship Or-, 
ganization expects to award sev­
eral scholarships in the fall, as has 
been its custom during several past 
years, to students of high scholas­
tic achievement, as well as to 
those who need financial aid. These 
scholarships will be given through 
the Scholarship Committee of Car­
negie Tech, of which Dean Tarbell 
is the chairman.This year the organization earned 
| $400, which is to be divided into 
$50 scholarships. However, a plan 
of setting aside part of the $400 in 
order to establish a trust fund so

“Woman has been told that she 
has been emancipated,” remarked 
a Carnegie co-ed. "Proper training, 
equivalent to that of the male of 
the species, to make possible ' the 
efficient use of her newly-born 
{powers, is certainly one of the im­
plications of that assurance. Why, 
then, has this been denied her?” 
The startling substantiation of 
the co-ed’s argument was the denial 
of R. O. T. C. training to the mass 
of her sex. Belittling, upon good 
authority, the R. O. T. C. purpose 
of preparedness and militarism, and 
emphasizing, as docs the same au­
thority, the desired and ultimate 
results of such discipline, she came 
to the conclusions that the depart­
ments in charge were not as intent 
upon creating “clean young women’’ 
as they were upon creating “clean 
young men,” that they were un­
willing to supply women with the 
instruments for the manufacture 
of sound minds and sound thoughts. 
She claimed that no vital refutation 
of her ideas could possibly, exist.
Grant that women arc not the ma 
tcrial of which fighting men arc 
made. Grant also that R. O. T. C. 
training concentrates upon the de- 
¡vclopmcnt of good citizenship rather 
than upon that of good soldiership. 
“Then answer,” she challenged, 
"my question as to why wc women 
cannot have an R. O. T. C. Arc 
wc not willing to take up the bur­
dens of citizenship, to succeed with 
which, as my authority still boars 
me out, it is necessary that good 
army training be had? Could wc 
hot wear uniforms becomingly?”
. “Surely,” the thinking co-ed con­
tinued,. "it cannot be those awful 
radicals that arc preventing us from 
the generally acknowledged benefits 
derived from military organization. 
Why, I tremble when I think that 
any one, even for Communist gold, 
would deprive recently emanci­
pated woman of her right to clcan 
womanhood and to the formula for 
obeying authority. Without these 
factors in the education of youth, 
it is almost impossible that our

Arts Alumni Will 
Entertain Seniors 
At Informal Dance
In conncction with the senior- 
alumni membership campaign which 
opened last evening with a meeting 
of 52 members of the senior class 
and the members of the Alumni 
Federation Board of Governors, a 
drive was begun to have every 
member of the senior class join the 
alumni association before his or 
her graduation.
In accordance with the plan car­
ried out last year, 52 seniors, repre­
sentatives of every department of 
the collcge, have volunteered to 
solicit the members of their depart­
ment in an effort to have 100 per 
cent alumni membership of the 
Class of 1930 before June 10.
The Alumni Federation has mSde 
a special dues rate to the seniors. 
The seniors who join the associa­
tion before Commercement Day will 
be entitled to the full privileges of 
the association at the rate of $2 
for the year beginning July I, 1930. 
There are two types of member- 
s b i p in the Alumni Federation, 
graduate and associate. All stu­
dents who receive a degree, diploma, 
or certificate arc entitled to gradu­
ate membership. Students who 
have attended at least one year of 
day school, or two years of night 
school, in ’ a regular course, are 
entitled to associate membership. 
Paid-up membership entitles the 
alumnus to rcccive the Tartan 
weekly, and the Carnegie Alumnus 
bi-monthly during the school year.. 
In addition to this, paid-up mem­
bership brings you all notices of 
alumni activities such as the alumni 
home-coming held in the fall, re­
unions, class parties, bridges, smok­
ers, dances, and football informa­
tion and ticket application blanks.

Men’s Clan of Philadelphia 
The- monthly luncheon of the 
Men's Clan of Philadelphia, held 
at Arcadia on April 29, was fea­
tured by a talk given by “Doc" 
Britton, Clan secretary, on ways 
and means of making the most of 
the Carncgic-Tcmplc game next 
fall. "Jack” Ferguson«was present, 
and lie, together with "Pick” Hines, 
led the group in a lively discussion 
on the advantages and disadvan­
tages of limiting college athletes 
to, participation in one major sport. 
Harry Newcomb gave a highly 
theoretical discussion on "Which 
Are Our More Proposing Stu­
dents?” based on a paper by the 
same title recently delivered by Dr. 
Davis of Stevens Institute of Tech­
nology. Rcggis Ward's comments 
on Newcomb’s talk brought the 
meeting to a close. "Doc” Britton 
would like to hear from any of the 
boys graduating this year, whose 
employment is going to bring them 
to Pliilly.
The Alumni Association of the 
College of Engineering has made 
definite plans to hold a smoker 
for engineering alumni and the 
juniors, seniors and faculty of 
the Engineering Coljcge on Fri­
day night, October 10, the eve­
ning before the Georgia Tech 
football game, at the German 
Club on Craig street. Enter­
tainment will be furnished by the 
students, alumni and faculty. 
This party is to be the begin­
ning of renewed alumni activi­
ties in the Engineering Alumni 
Association.
Last year the W. A. A. Board 
acted upon suggestions brought 
back from the sectional A. C. A. C. 
W. conference in North Carolina 
and held a conference of its own 
on June 7, 8, and 9. The old and 
new boards spent the week-end 
at a small cabin in Dorscyvillc, and 
there made plans for the next 
year. It was hoped that such an 
annual meeting would not only 
eliminate the confusion that natur­
ally arises during the short and 
hurried meetings at the beginning 
of the fall semester, but that the 
new members would become ac­
quainted with their duties and the 
procedure of the Board.
The two boards arranged a pro­
gram for the entire year that in­
cluded many new ideas, «fiid, on the 
whole, those new experiments have 
been remarkably successful. The 
problems of the past year were 
discussed, and new laws were pass­
ed and old ones repealed to pre­
vent, as far as possible, such prob­
lems from arising again.
At the close of the conference 
the Boards decided that the meet­
ing had been so profitable that it 
should become a permanent event 
on the W. A. A. program. In 
accordance with that decision', the 
present Board announces the dates 
for the Second Annual Board Con­
ference. On June 6, 7 and 8, the 
new and old Boards will go to 
Dorscyvillc to prepare the pro­gram for 1930-31.

.wide in scope and attracted thou­
sands of contestants. The North 
Dakota Agricultural College, of 
Fargo, N. D., the Missouri Mili­
tary Academy of Mixico, Mo., and 
the Western Kentucky State Teach­
ers’ College of Bowling Green, 
Ky., were national winners in the 
senior, military and junior divi­
sions, respectively.
Those firing on the Carnegie 
team were: P. B. Hudson, B.
Scott, D. Cuthbcrt, F. Bcckcrt, 
Jr., and Leo Kaschagcn.
YOU will discover the full pleasure 
of pipc-smoking when you hit on 
the tobacco that really suits you in the 
pipe that really fits you. Then you can 
light up and lean back and cross your 
feet on the mantel or wherever, and 
purr and smoke—how you can smoke!
The trick is to find your pipe and 
your tobacco. Nobody can find them 
for you, and until you find them you 
must go on groping in outer darkness 
—but have you tried Edgeworth?
Edgeworth may be just the tobacco 
you’re looking for. It has a certain 
distinctive flavor that men like; it is 
slow-burning, cool—it will not bite 
your tongue; and it is rich with the 
savor, fragrant with the aroma, of fine 
old burley blended exactly right.
Check us up—try Edgeworth in a 
good pipe. • We’ll send you some help­
ful hints on pipes, and we’ll even send 
you some Edgeworth, ra generous free 
packet of it to try, for nothing but

INTER NIGHT COLLEGE 
DANCE MAY 10 
GYMNASIUM
*s=
How' did you like the color of 
jhe Pink sheet last week? Some Tar­
tan wasn’t it? If you read all that 
Was in it, it would take you a 
week of nights to do it, allowing no 
time off, that is providing you are 
a fast reader, and arc able to get 
the significance of what you are 
reading.
•This was a fast and furious past 
week for the citizens of the Campus, 
both groups included. Between regis­
tering for the Supplementary Term, 
attendance at classes, Spring Carnival, 
Inter-Night College Dance there was 
hardly a spare moment' left.
I have registered, as I said before, 
for the Supplementary Term, and 
am a full fledged student for one 
of the“ courses which are given, or 
rather taken, if you have a mind. 
Sure is a little tough getting into the 
harness, but I am sure that after 
10 or 15 weeks go by one will be 
so weak that he will not mind it, 
so why should I.. However, it does 
appear a bit lonesome to see the halls 
deserted these ev.cnings when only a 
few days ago there were hundreds of 
night students trodding the corridors. 
But that is the way of life—you are 
here today, and tomorrow something 
else takes up your time, or you have 
gone elsewhere. Who knows what the 
fates have in store for us?
Speaking about Carnival Week, or 
Spring Carnival as it was called this 
year, how many were there? Well I 
for one was there, and I am here to 
state that I never saw a better show 
worked up any’ where. There was 
just enough done here and there to 
put you in mind of the festivities, 
and if you didn’t have a good time, 
it was all your own fault. Of course, 
this was a day school function, but 
they were not a bit selfish, and any 
night student who wanted to come 
could buy tags and present himself 
at the various functions.
The Inter-Night College Dance was 
the final windup of the night groups, 
and,, they also did themselves up in 
gicir "atyle. The decorations Were in 
the shape of balloons and spot lights 
of various colors. The Gymnasium 
was transformed into, a beautiful 
symphony of color with thousands 
' of balloons. Those little rubber
globes of air were rather tempting, 
and I noticed some of the committee 
were kept busy keeping them up dur­
ing the dance. When the zero hour 
(12 P. X.) arrived it was a sad 
moment because all the fun and 
jollification of the year came to a 
close.
I wonder where DIDJA NO­
TICE went last week? I sorta 
look for this column annually, and 
when I don't see it, I get all work­
ed up over it. And by the way, 
what became of the Book Review?: 
I suppose they were crowded for 
space, and had to leave some of 
the copy out, and, of course, the 
ones I, liked were sure to be the 
ones left out. Also the Broad­
caster for C. I. T. (General Stud­
ies) has been silent for a . while.
No doubt the bulbs arc burnt out,
or maybe the set has gone on the 
rocks, temporarily. At least, I 
hope so, because it would never do 
to have such a powerful station 
lose its charter in the face of such 
keen competition as one encounters 
nowadays.
NOTICE TO
TICKET SALESMEN
As the Infer Night College 
Dance, held last Saturday evening, 
was the final function on the Night 
Student Council social calendar, all 
night students who were selling

SPRING CARNIVAL AS 
SEEN FROM A NIGHT 
STUDENT VIEW POINT
The writer of ^his article lias 
had the experience of witnessing a 
number of annual spring festivals 
on the Carnegie Campus. The pre­
vious functions were held under the 
name of Campus Week. It was a 
difficult question to keep strict 
discipline at all times during these 
student gathcrngs, and from time 
to time unpleasant happenings 
crept in until the final death knell 
was sounded two years ago. This 
was indeed a lamentable state of 
affairs, because all the students 
were not to blame; in fact,' the 
present student body arc only the 
sufferers for the sins of those who 
went before them.
A new page in the history of 
activities has been written this 
year by the student body. Fight­
ing with all the determination they 
could muster, a group of students 
led by James Aslnvell overcame 
one obstacle after another until 
finally permission was secured to 
hold a festivity in the spring. A 
new name had to be assigned to 
this function, so the name "Spring 
Carnival,” was decided upon.
From the very start of prepara­
tions until curtain on Saturday eve­
ning, many difficulties had to be 
overcome, and that this was done 
goes without saying. Just when 
one point was cleared up another 
one loomed into sight, but this 
group of energetic students would 
not' let down until each victory 
; was won. Mr. Dcvcrcll and Mr. 
Ashweil, together with all the oth­
ers of the committee are certainly 
to be commended for their untir­
ing efforts.
It is difficult to enumerate all 
the outstanding features of the 
Spring Carnival, but there are a 
few worthy of special mention.
As everybody knows, you can 
either make or break a function 
by the decorating scheme employ­
ed. That the former was the 
happy outcome is the result of the 
efforts of Bud Owens and his co- 
workers both in the Union and in 
the Gymnasium. The Union was a 
veritable bower of spring time, and 
indicated * a well thought out 
scheme. The mammoth Gymna­
sium was also well handled and 
its coldness toned up with the use 
of many colored spotlights.
The Coronation Ceremonies em­
ploying a pageant based on the 
story of “Sleeping Beauty,” was 
without doubt the finest piece of 
tableaux work ever witnessed on 
the Campus. And the queen— 
Isobcl Sheppard—where could you 
find a more royal personage. She 
is every inch a queen. Congratu­
lations, Miss Sheppard.
The “Highland Fling” L.I,N an in­
novation, and took the place of the 
costume ball of previous years. 
Many bizzarc costumes were in 
evidence, but not one of them was 
in anyway offensive. In fact the 
comment heard on all sides was 
that the “Highland Fling” showed 
the student body to be of a very 
Gne caliber, and that they deserv­
ed to be commended very highly.
Another innovation was the Cab­
aret Dance held in the' Gymnasium 
on Saturday afternoon, and it did 
not take much imagination to 
transfix yourself to a real Cabaret. 
You had all the environment sup­
plied.
Co-operation was the key-note, 
and it was made manifest 
every side. The night student side 
was not overlooked cither, for in 
the preparations we. „were given 
consideration. The Inter- Night 
College dance was held Saturday 
evcniiig in the Gymnasium, and 
the various committees assisted us 
in every way to make oiir function 
a success, We had at our disposal 
all the decorations used by the day 
group in their Spring Carnival.
It is therefore with a spirit of 
commendaton to all those students 
of the day group who helped in 
any way to make this Spring Car­
nival the success that it was, and 
more especially to Mr. Deverell, 
Mr. Ashweil, Mr. Owens, Tom 
Lippert and Mr. Bunker, do I ad­
dress my remarks. I also wish 
to express the appreciation of the 
night group for all the considera­
tion afforded us on the occasion 
of our Inter-Night College dance.

PLAID STAFF GUESTS 
OF TARTAN STAFF 
AT ANNUAL BANQUET
The annual banquet of the Tar­
tan .Staff was held last Tuesday 
evening at the Carnegie Inn Dining 
Room. An invitation to the Plaid 
Staff was extended by Thomas 
Lippert, the successful, energetic 
Tartan editor, to attend the ban­
quet, which was accepted, and the 
Plaid staff turned out in full force. 
James H. Sansonctti, president of 
the Night Student Council, jvas 
also extended an invitation.
After • a very delightful dinner, 
the annual presentation of activi­
ties keys to the various members 
of the Tartan Staff took place. Mr. 
Lippert was the host for the occa­
sion, and called upon various mem­
bers of the Tartan staff for a few 
remarks. This was the first oppor­
tunity the plaid Staff had of meet­
ing this large group, and it was a 
most enjoyable experience. Mr. 
Lippert called up Mr. McDonald 
for a few words, and he responded 
on behalf of the Plaid Staff, and 
thanked the Tartan Staff f<?r their 
kind consideration of the night 
group, and gave a brief outline of 
the work done by the Plaid. He 
commented upon the splendid man­
ner in which Mr. Lippert, and the 
Tartan Staff had co-operated with 
him and the. Plaid group, and ex­
pressed the hope that this spirit of 
co-operation would continue.
Mr. Lippert called upon Mr. San­
sonctti for a few words, and Jim 
my, as we know him, responded 
in a very noble manner. Mr. Mc­
Donald introduced the other mem­
bers of the Plaid Staff, Mr. James

SOME FACTS ON THE 
LIFE OF ANTON MAUVE
Mauve was born in Zoandam in 
183S, and died in Arnhcim, Hol­
land in 1SSS. Every artist has his 
especial taste in landscape. Just 
as every man secs nature through 
different spectacles, so every artist 
creates according to his own tem­
perament. Mauve, once convinced 
in what line his talent lay, remain­
ed ever after faithful to the green 
fields, country lanes, sand-dunes of 
his own country, rich meadows 
with grazing cattle, and to the 
hard-worked, sad-eyed women bend- 
over washtubs, or tending sheep 
and goats. He loved his old Dutch 
home, with its flocks and folds, its 
black firs and silver lakes. He de­
lighted in the low-lying, landscapes 
enveloped in soft haze and uprising 
mist, and in the indistinct outline 
with which Nature blended her pic­
ture together.
His arf: possesses poetry, tender­
ness and a, charming influence. He 
is best known for his flocks of 
sheep, portrayed under every as­
pect of weather, season, and light 
and shade. He is justly famous for 
the .suppression of minor details in 
his pictures; his appeal lying in 
the great simplicity in which he 
portrays his stories. —W. E. Z.
Endowment Fund Dona­
tions Still Coming In
With the week just past; the 
Night Student Council campaign 
for contributions to the Carnegie 
1946 Endowment Fund was materi­
ally increased. Several students 
who failed to turn in their locker 
keys previously, took advantage of 
the fact that the key room was 
open Monday, Wednesday and Fri­
day evenings to return their keys 
and contribute tliçir dollar to the 
fund. The key rpom will be open 
the same evenings this week. Fri­
day evening, May 16, however, will
be the final evening for the room 
S. Geyser, News Editor; o31CA1 J. ilo bc open.
Molyneaux, Mr. David E. South, 
and Mr. . E. DcLorcnzo, Engineer­
ing, Industries and Arts Associate 
News Editors, and each responded 
with a few words.
At this time Mr. Lippert an­
nounced the new appointments to 
the Tartan Staff for next year. Mr. 
John J. Doyle was made Editor-in- 
Chief and he received the congrat­
ulations of all present.
The banquet terminated with 
everybody holding high hopes for 
a very successful coming year, and 
with the excellent foundation laid 
by our host and good friend, Tom 
Lippert, this expectation should 
not be hard to achieve.

1930 THISTLE
The 1930 staff of the Thistle ex­
pect to have the book available 
for distribution about May 25. 
From all indications this year book 
will be a fine example of the 
printers’ art. No expense has been 
spared to make the book a worthy 
successor of other years.
There arc still a few copies un­
subscribed for, and any night stu­
dents who desire a copy can order 
one by sending in a check for the 
initial payment of $2.75, and the 
balance will be due When the book 
is delivered. This order should be 
sent to the Night Student Council, 
Box 137, Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, Schcnlcy Park, Pitts­
burgh, Pa.
Better send in that order now, 
because when the supply is ex­
hausted it will be impossible to 
obtain more, arid you will regret 
not having your history for the 
year. 1930.
Relative to our request in last 
cclc’s issue of the Plaid for those 
not having locker keys and wish- 
to -contribute, many have re­
sponded by mailing a dollar to the 
Council. Contributions sent in 
should be addressed to • the Night 
Student Council, Box 137, C. I. T*, 
Post Office, and don’t forget to 
sign your name.
All contributions collected in this 
campaign arc to be applied to the 
Student Activities Building project 
which the Night Student Council 
has so heartily .endorsed and asks 
your loyal support. The need of 
this building has been mentioned 
several limes lately on this, page 
and the co-operation of every night 
student will be greatly appreciated. 
All contributions 'will be acknowl­
edged in the Plaid when a com­
plete tabulation of all donations Is 
made. —G.

War Nurse” (Cosmopolitan), is 
by Rebecca Weston. You ought 
to be tired of war books by now, 
but maybe this one will interest 
you. I prefer a Lucky (free ad). 
All levity aside, this is pretty good. 
Recommended.
“Party Dress” (Borzoi), is by an 
old favorite, Joseph Hcrgcsheimer. 
“It’s thrilling!’’ says Miss Amy 
Doakes, of Fair Oaks. "So 
naughty—but, nicc,” gushes Ilcna 
Peake. Read it with a jaundiced 
eye, say I, and you’ll find it a lit­
tle better than usual. Incidentally, 
it’s about the effect a “party 
dress” has on an up-to-now charm­
ing but sedate matron.
, “Cimarron” (Doubleday-Doran) 
is by Edna Fcrber. You've prob­
ably read it by now, but if you 
haven’t, do so by all means. 
Heartily recommended.
“Tagati” (Putnam’s) is by Cyn­
thia Stockley, if it means anything 
to you. It’s about Africa and 
there’s shootings in the back and 
poisonings. ,1 didn’t like It.
“Ladies' Man” (Harper),' is by 
Rupert Hughes. It’s abiput a suave 
gigolo who has the ladies eating 
out of his hand. He gets pushed 
out of a convenient window in one 
of the cleverest (merely my own 
opinion) murder plots yet conceiv­
ed. My sympathies arc entirely 
with the murdered one, but you 
ought to read the story merely 
for the uncovering of the murder. 
It takes place-at the beginning and 
like the movies flashes back. But 
don’t let it fool you; -start at the 
end. —E. DeL.
CARNEGIE SONG BOOK
The Night Student Council has 
a few copies of the new song book 
available for sale. The price of 
this song book is $1. The book 
is a very fine number and con­
tains all of the songs and numbers 
heard at Carnegie. In addition to 
this, a special feature was adopted 
of including some of the wonder­
ful scenes on and about our cam­
pus.
Any night student desiring a 
copy can obtain it by sending a 
check to the Night Student Coun- 
,c:' covering the price ($1), and a 
copy' will be mailed. Be sure to 
give address When ordering the 
song book.

Winter is dying,
Spring is here.
The air is calmer:— 
The skies arc clear, 
The trees are budding, 
The grass is green; 
The birds arc singing, 
Building nests unseen.
The woods arc calling, 
They cast their spell, 
Beckoning to explore, 
Both field and dell;
The flowers are peeping 
Above the green sod, 
To chccr the toiler 
As lie homeward plods.
The brook, it rushes 
On to the sea,
With a dull roaring 
That is music to me;
The children arc playing, 
They shout with glee, 
They, too, love the brook 
That rushes on to the sea.
So life unfolds 
Like the many seasons;
We comc, wc go 
Seemingly without reason; 
The dawn of our lives 
Merges into the sunset of

And we pass into the Be.-,

And leave behind all
sorrow.

Women and Activities
As this is the “Women’s Issue” of The Tartan it seems 
only fitting that Carnegie Women and their activities should 
be given particular attention.
Women on the Carnegie Campus have far surpassed the 
men in their work in activities and in the quality of the work 
that they, produce. It is true that altho the women do not 
directly'run the activities in which they mutually engage with 
men, the organizations which are handled solely by women are 
much'superior in administration and secure much better, results 
than those which are managed by men only.' Politics have more 
to do with the situation than many would believe. Politics,' as 
known to the men’s school, are almost unheard of in the women’s 
organizations, due largely to the fact that the women have no 
strong social fraternities. Fraternal affiliations of the men cause 
them to expend their' energies fighting within themselves instead 
of working in harmony for the good of the school in general. 
Due to the absence of political mechanisms the women usually 
manage to elect the most capable women to office which natur­
ally .brings the best results.
The Women’s Activities Point System, which was_ adopted 
two years ago, has done more than any other single factor to 
improve the administration of women’s affairs. The point sys­
tem altho not yet perfect has practically eliminated the practice 
of one or two women holding five or six major positions and 
having so much to do that no one thing is done well. ‘.Such a 
system, if it were adopted by the men, might help greatly to' 
bring their offices on a par with those of the wnmen..
Even between' the honorary fraternities there is a decided 
difference in policy and ability. Several years ago the men’s 
honoraries had become the laughing stock of the school and 
altho this may not be true now the women’s honoraries have 
a much greater significance than the men’s.
Women are becoming more and m.ore interested in major 
activities, such as the Student Council, and intend to show the 
school that they are just as capable, if not more sp, of handling 
them. They are more prone to use common sense first and 
politics afterward than are the men, who first try to play politics 
and then resort to common sense.
We have reason to be proud of our women and their activi 
- tics, and hope that they will attain even greater heights in the 
future.* * + • * *
The Alumni Federation
This week the Alumni Federation is conducting a member­
ship campaign among the seniors. It should be almost, unneces­
sary to urge members of the graduating class to join this asso­
ciation for their own individual benefit, not simply because it 
is the thing to do. The Federation is the only Connecting link 
. between the school and the graduates and often • between the 
graduates themselves. In the monthly magazine, the Carnegie 
Alumnus, is' published annually a complete alumni directory 
which is invaluable to graduates for a host of reasons, not the 
least of which is for Christmas addresses. The Carnegie Clans 
of various cities which are fostered by the Federation, provide 
welcome social contracts-with other Carnegians. The Federation 
also organizes many social affairs during the school year and 
through the Athletic Office secures choice seats for alumni at all 
.football games. Many instances, have occurred wherein fine 
positions were open to graduates for which the eligible men 
could not be located, due to the fact that they had failed to 
establish connections with the Federation.
The small annual fee should not be considered as dues but 
rather, as an investment, the returns, from which are immeasur­
able.

ceit, we were neither offended nor 
embarrassed by your remarks, 
merely amused.
For the benefit of those not in­
timately concerned, other things of 
interest happened at this same func­
tion. Hoof was pleased to find 
out why Rev. Lippert (as Gessling 
will have it) was violet-gatherin; 
last week. Mr. Boyle, your future 
editor, was a little flushed and 
nervous about his speech, but man 
aged to get it over quite success­
fully, nevertheless. Our very lovely 
news editor looked as gracious as 
usual. We were relieved to dis­
cover the innocent reason for her 
acquisition of an S.A.E. pin. The 
Senior Commercials came in suffi­
ciently late to attract the attention 
that is so odious to them. Miss 
Barr seems to have acquired the 
art of looking enviably cool even 
when the mercury mounts as high 
as it did that night. We w-onder 
whether the Senior Genter’s office 
on the Champs Elysee is dedicated 
to the practice of dental surgery. 
Anyway G. Jr. is an extremely 
capable after-dinner speaker.
Hoof’s random shots of Campus 
Carnival wouid probably .be some­
thing like this, perhaps a little 
more caustic. .The King and Queen 
eating ice-cream in a manner not 
the' least bit regal at the Country 
Fair. Phi Kap Worland doing his 
best to make his brothers sound 
more or less in tune at this same 
affair. The sophomore architects 
disgracing the Carnegie Clan, Beaux 
Arts and themselves at the other­
wise beautiful Coronation. Also 
there is the curse of Yo-Yo, al­
though we vowed .we wouldn’t so 
much as give it recognition in print. 
Jimmy Ashwell’s Ripley-worthy en­
durance seems to have been one 
of the outstanding events of Quali­
fications. Then, of course, we’re 
wondering how- long it’s going to 
take the Betas to recover from 
their spectacular victory.
Credit is certainly coming to the 
lion. Chester Wallace and his pro­
teges for the splendid performance 
that they gave us. A remark was 
passed in back of us -.by a non- 
Carnegian with reference to the 
superiority of this production as 
compared with the feeble efforts of 
a university whose present claim 
to fame is a partially completed 
sky-scraper; Naturally such a com­
parison would be in our favor. 
After all a school’s achievements 
in this or any other field ean 
scarcely be measured by the height 
of her buildings.Permit us a few parting shots. 
To the inimitable Pedal Appendage 
let us say that to find a successor 
to you, at least one so Winchellian 
as yourself, is going to be a diffi 
cult task. To those members' of 
the Senior Class whose names ap- 
pear -at the top of the masthead 
of this sheet wet. will just say 
“Good-bye” before we get senti­
mental. And to you, Cardo, for in 
spite of yourself, you’ve probably 
read this far,—Godspeed!
Think It Over
Carnegians who remember with 
delight the rare treat which the 
Drama Department gave last No­
vember with , the presentation of 
“The Gardner’s Dog” will be much 
interested in the offering of the 
Y. M. and W. H. A. Playhouse, 
actors next Tuesday, Wednesday 
and Thursday, in-as-much as their 
latest play is being staged and di­
rected by Boris Glagolin. He it 
was who staged “The Gardner’s 
Dog” so successfully. Mr. Glago­
lin is a Russian constructivist whose 
dramatic career started many years 
before the World war in the Liter­
ary Art Society Theater of Petro- 
grad. Since then- he has been head 
of all the theatres in Ukrania and 
just recently he held the position 
of director of the Theater of the 
Revolution.
“The Golem” which Mr. Glagolin 
is presenting at the Playhouse is 
a play which he himself has writ­
ten. The plot is built about an 
old Hebrew legend of the Golem, a 
clay image fashioned during the 
Middle Ages by a gifted Jewish 
Rabbi of that day. This image .be­
came the symbol of God to the 
hard driven, persecuted Jews of 
the Middle Ages and the years 
succeeding. “The Golem” provides 
a central theme for the fascinat­
ing drama the “Y” Playhouse is 
presenting the evening of May 20, 
21 and 22, in the Morris Kaufmann 
Memorial Auditorium at 115 South 
Bellc'ficld avenue.
SCHOLARSHIP
(Continued from Page One) 
that there may be a perpetual 
source from which to award scholar­
ships is being considered. The or­
ganization will welcome the finan­
cial contribution of any campus 
roup to this trust fund.
The annual benefit performance, 
which is sponsored by the Wom­
en’s Scholarship Organization, will 
be given in the fall of next year 
rather than in the spring.
W:hen Presdcnt Nielson 'of Smith 
College announced ' to his. students; 
the new rules restricting, smoking 
to two fireproof rooms,.-following 
a number of dormitory fires due "to 
cigarettes in waste baskets or 
matches flung at muslin curtains, 
he closed his necessary but bound- 
to-bc-unpopular address with this 
amiable comment, “The trouble is,, 
my dear young ladies, 3'ou do not 
smoke like gentlemen.” ' .
Apparently a good many women: 
still feel that their right to smoke- 
is a bit precarious,', if one may so 
conclude from the bravado which 
accompanies the- smoking ; habit, 
now that it is. becoming the cus­
tom among groups not given to 
much philosophizing in regard *to 
what constitutes suitable behavior. 
The right of women to.;-smoke in 
restaurants and other public places 
has been recognized for some years, 
and yet there arc still those who 
feel that they must puli forth cigar­
ettes and puff at them determinedly 
from the moment of entrance l-o 
the moment of leaving a public 
diningroom, smoking right through 
soup, fish, meat, salad and dessert! 
in a way to horrify the epicure 
and astonish the masculine con­
tingent which enjoys its food. 
Charming, long-legged stenograph-' 
crs perched on stools before candy- 
shop • soda fountains, smoking - 
cigarette from one hand and’ sip^ 
ping, chocolate ice cream soda with 
marshmallow frosting from the 
other, arc a sight now becoming 
common, but one calculated to 
paralyze the less hardy section . of 
the human race. Children buying 
lollipops and old ladies purchasing 
sweets for Sunday school festivals 
pause 011 the threshold,, confused 
between . the beribboncd, belaced 
daintiness of the decorations and 
the barroom .atmosphere contribut­
ed by the customers. Sometimes 
one of the old ladies can be heard 
to murmur, “Gentlemen never did such things.”
Who in America, remembers, see­
ing a man smoke in a railway din­
ing car? The railroad has thought­
fully provided another place for 
smoking all thesfc years, and the 
male traveler has recognized the 
rights of the old, the young and 
the ill of the traveling public, t‘0 
cat in the closely confined: space o,f 
a dining car without the addition 
of tobacco smoke; but not. so those 
girls who feel it necessary to pro­
claim their emancipation from any 
vantage point. The embarrassed 
stewards of dining cars, explaining 
to male patrons why they • cannot 
smoke- while the ' lady at the other 
end puffs her cigarette, have fur­
nished one of the inexpensive 
amusements of American life to a 
constant traveler. The waiting 
rooms of country railroad stations; 
usually , plastered with No Smoking 
signs and sometimes with requests 
to loaf in the baggage room, where 
the male of the species has always 
been found taking his smoke, Seem 
to be another favorite stamping 
round for the small-town or ev6ri- city-bred woman smoker. Although 
I have haunted art exhibitions and 
art galleries for years, I have, I 
think, never seen any man smok­
ing in those chaste and neutral 
backgrounds. It remained for a 
couple of rather plain middle-aged 
women to muss up the floor and 
haze up the air, successfully ob1* 
scuring the exquisite colors of 
Georgia O’Keefe'at a recent show­ing. • •
Knowing that any social group is 
apt to be a bit crude and uncon­
trolled when taking on new and 
expanded customs, recognizing the 
validity of the inferiority complex 
from which bravado springs when 
women try to act like gentlemen 
without being such, and believing 
that in time the solid human virtue 
of consideration for the rights of, 
others would prevail, I should have 
held my peace, had not - this un-. 
fortunate habit of smoking'in un­
suitable places and under unsuit­
able circumstances recently .per­
vaded the shops and department 
stores ' of most of our large and
small cities in the East. First it 
was the little millinery shops in 
smart side streets which began put­
ting -ash trays on the table in front 
of the mirror. Then came the 
"booteries,” which offered grandma 
matches on a wonderfully bal­
anced ash receiver when she came 
in . to buy a pair of felt bedroom 
slippers. These were merely funny; 
but recently the ladies have taken 
to smoking all over-'our depart­
ment stores and larger mercantile 
establishments in such a way as to 
create a serious fire hazard, and I 
feel that people should know the 
danger, lest what arc now merely 
bad manners should become a seri 
ous menace to life.
In practically ever}' store- of Any 
size there exists a serious fire haz­
ard-first, because of the quickly 
inflammable nature of the goods 
and wares displayed for sale, and 
second, because . of the presence in 
the building of . large numbers of 
strangers, unorganized, undiscip­
lined and uninstructed with refer­
ence to the location of exits, even 
when these, arc adequate. The fire 
hazard is well known to fire de­
partments,. labor departments, fire 
underwriters and other expert 
bodies. The technical difficulty of 
providing enough stairways to 
empty such buildings of the huge 
crowds which sometimes congre­
gate at bargain sales, and - holiday 
shopping periods is -so great as to 
make it impossible to predict what 
would happen in . case- of a fire in 
a mercantile establishment at a 
crowded time of day. It is impos 
sible to have fire drills, as in- fac­
tories,..and very difficult to provide 
sufficient exit facilities'.
The codes and laws - governing 
mercantile establishments have 
never included ¦ a - prphibition of 
smoking, as do the- factory laws, 
because in the past smoking was 
never the custom there. The main 
reliance -for safety in these estab­
lishments-has: always been upon the 
prevention of fire. The most com­
mon cause of firtf: of all- classes in 
the United "States is cigarettes. Our 
carelessness - with .-them is ¦¦ prover­
bial and, now ,- that. women . are 
smokings the big-, mercantile estab­
lishments- which have heretofore 
been free of. great .disasters in this 
country -are subject. to a. new 
hazard..
This hazard should be stamped 
out now before the custom of smok­
ing in department stores has- be­
come common. Men have never 
permitted themselves any such care­
less infringement upon , the .rights 
of .others.. W;tlk;. .into ...any; haber­
dashery or men’s clothing sjiop 
and-you will: not set men-, smoking; 
nor. do you see them,, smoking in 
hardware. (storps,\ florist. ,sliop^ ..or 
other places, they ipattrxmize. ' They 
find Jt possible to,, ; try , 011 their 
shoes and their hats and even. to 
go .into fitting rooms and have 
thei.r new evening clothes -fitted, 
without .smoking; but. not . so the 
women.
Only a determined effort on the 
part of store managers, fire under­
writers and local fire departments, 
together, with the rigid practice of 
a rule, of social etiquette, based on 
consideration for .the lives, and com­
fort- of others and sponsored by 
women. L.V,R have .achieved both 
emancipation and so.cjal.. posjtjon, 
will -check this growing danger..
Department store managers often 
arc too ready 'to jump to a coiir 
elusion' as: to what "women want.” 
Thus, in-the-case of .smoking, they 
have practically invited the custom 
to establish itself in their midst. 
In some - cities' today it is next to 
impossblc • to purchase a chiffon 
evening frock . or a bit' of lingerie 
except from the depths of a- soft 
chair upholstered in ¦ green glazed 
chintz,. where the customer- is- sur­
rounded by fash trays and glowing 
cigarettes provided by-a thought­
less management. But -the lady 
whom I saw leaning on one elboyv 
at a lace counter the other day, 
puffing a cigarette while' purchas­
ing-yards of tulle, frills, was a. sym­
bol of .-what the unchastencd woman

Campus King?
Not content with letting the female 
of the species grab all the glory, the 
lonely male has stepped in and issued 
an ultimatum. He too, will figure 
in campus events, lie too, will have a 
—King! But do not overlook that, 
though said males carried the contcst 
to the finish, it was the inhabitants 
of Mellon Hall that sponsored the 
affair and made it possible. In con­
junction with the famed date book 
exhibited in the Country Fair, the 
polls were open for. votes: for Campos 
King. And the fair winner, the win­
some choice of the people, the campus 
Adonis and Margaret Morrison idol, 
is none other than—Murray Giles 
Armentrout, of football fame, Beta 
Theta Pi, etc., etc. The people’s choice 
received a total of 21 votes, and his 
men-in-waiting were the Hon. James 
Ashweil,- and (a tic between these 
two) Robert H. (alias “Gibby”)
Smith,-and V. McBride. The Court 
of notables 'is composed of Russ 
Kambach, Frank Foote, Tom Lippert, 
Jolin Drcshar, and S. Laurelle Hol- 
verstot't, all of campus and newspaper fame.
The King will be crowned 011
Decoration Day, in a solemn and 
beautiful ceremony, at which the 
symbol of sovereignty will be plopped
011 the. royai dome. The men-in- 
waiting- will be ' equipped with 
specially prepared tear bombs, rubber 
sling shots, and . other defensive
arms to ward off possible vegetable
tributes of the multitude, while each 
of the. Court will sport an official 
“billy,” and the usual line of chat­
ter. The ccrcmony: will take place in 
the Bowl late at night—as late as 
possible. The best wishes and the 
deepest sympathy of^ the campus go 
out to the ncwly-clcctcd one, and wc 
are sure that he (wc arc, almost 
tempfed to capitalize the “he,” such a 
personnage. has.he become) will,carry 
off his position with due solemnity 
and grace.

THISTLEDOWN
An Autobiography (New Type, i.e.
Chiefly Fiction)
When Cardo Chardon Disenwolle 
was trying to make up his mind 
where to go 'to college, his re­
ligious great-aunt warned him not
to go to Tech, because she had
been told that tliefe was a school
of'drama there, and in her opinion 
any school of drama was only a 
preparatory school for hell. One 
of Disenwollc's coUstns told him 
that otic could, learn to play really 
good bridge, dance skilfully, blow 
smoke rings, swear collcgiately, and 
date at Tech as well as at any 
other college. His math teacher 
told him lie was probably too dumb 
to get by the plcbc math course 
until lie had flunked it oncc, but 
that Tech certainly was a grand 
old school. So Disenwolle came 
to Tech in' the fall, and after 
satisfying the Examiner that lie 
didn’t have halitosis, was no germ 
carrier of cpidermiphatosis, and had 
only incipient pityriasis capitis, lie 
was admitted.
Happy, happy freshman days! 
Disenwolle, green as a sour apple 
and as fresh as unsalted butter, 
found he had a lot coming to him, 
but he car^l little about that, be­
cause lie was discovering, new joys 
in life. There were such beings-as 
plcbc girls, he found, - attractive 
plcbc girls, who were even, not 
unwilling to let him take them to 
danccs, to movies, to restaurants, 
to theaters, on automobile rides. 
In the fall-^thesc were the days 
when Tech- school, spirit had not 
yet entered upon what some call 
its present state of decline .and fall 
—there were football games under 
rainy October skies,. games at 
which Disenwolle with all other 
loyal plebcs yelled himself hoarse, 
and snake-danced about the field , be­
tween the halves.-. It was 011.one of 
these snake dances that Disenwolle 
first met Lippert, a tall kid just 
ahead of,him in the line, on whose 
shouldcr.s it was rather hard to 
keep one’s hands. In the spring 
Disenwolle learned to wander about 
the romantic paths of, Schenlcy 
Park. (He certainly . had been 
dumb, never to have realized be­
fore what parks were for.)
These things made Disenwolle 
satisfied with Tech and happy he 
had come here in spite of the 
calamities •(somewhat fewer in num­
ber and easier to bear now) that 
used to happen to every-plcbc, the | 
calamities of the plebc dorms, plcbc
regulations, plcbc trials, Grill serv­
ice and some of the Grill specials, 
and Hell Week. - Hell Week al­
most ruined him. It had so little 
influence on his P.Q.’s that his 
reputation for occasional intelligence 
only bccamc a ncvcr-to-be-ncglcctcd 
joke to be used against -him by his friends.
That summer Disenwolle earned 
his next year’s expenses,by work­
ing at the Offiiut Research Labo­
ratories at Paranoia, Iowa, on the 
problem of extracting the water 
from watermelons and popularizing 
it as a summer beverage to replace ginger ale.
What is there that a sopliomor* 
cannot accomplish . if he tries': 
Nothing, Disenwolle believed, and 
that is how he bccamc Thistledown. 
The column was at the time being 
badly written by a well known 
Tech eccentric. Disenwolle one 
day reading the column flung it 
down with disgust. “Why, I 
couldn't write any worse than that 
if 1 tried,” lie snorted. “Well then, 
why don’t you?” his roommate 
asked. For three weeko Disenwolle 
submitted Thistledown copy, and 
then for three weeks more, ab­
sorbed by polar co-ordinates and 
intrcgations by standard formulae, 
ncglccted his new interest in jour­
nalism, before lie saw his copy 
appearing in the Thistledown col­
umn, and flattered by its appear­
ance, continued to write, week 
after week, what seemed to have 
become his column. To bring 
gaiety to the bleak back page of 
the Tartan, to mitigate some of 
the -.barbaric ideas so evident in 
Tech college life, were Thistle­
down’s two aims. How well he 
succeeded, let one man’s criticism 
suggest. . fn Editor Lippcrt’s opin­
ion those were the goldcncst days 
of the column.
(To be concluded next week)
Advance of publication criticism: 
I find Thistledown’s Autobiography 
a- remarkable piece of mendacity. 
Thistledown’s complete disregard of 
veracity should carry him far, very 
far. E. F.
Dear Thistledown: How many
of all these things I've heard about 
you .in the last week .am I to be­
lieve? Joe. In the name of An­
drew, none, or as few as possible. 
When 1 was a plcbc 1 looked like 
a head of lettuce, but this new 
notoriety is making me feel more 
and more like a beet. C. C. D.
Madam Queen Leads Campus Crowds 
In Colorful, Carefree CeSebration
The Carnegie Carnival, the Spring 
Frolic, or rejuvenated Campus 
Week, is, ended, amid a blaze of 
Japanese¿lanterns- and -confused 
memories“ of coronations, sweep­
stakes, and other mementoes of 
collitch gustc.
The sturdy arched front of 
'Women’s Perogrativcs” was con- 
vc£.ted„ ¡nt.Q. a. gigantic scale .for 
pushmobile purposes, while the 
competing pushers looked 011, proud­
ly displaying their buggies confi­
dent of victory . . . Manager Tomer 
wore a harassed look of respon­
sibility that sat strangely ...
We didn’t go to the County 
Fair, but if \ye . had, the Delta 
Yoopsilons would have been minus 
their La Palomos and Havanas— 
by reason, of the offensivcness of 
their targets. Was the date box 
filled? Why . not establish/a date 
bureau in conjunction with. Mellon 
I-Iall? . . . The T. D. H. ballet 
dancer was none other than Cliaun- 
cey Owens of. Phi Psi fame,, late 
of the U. S. Marineis—and the Phi 
Kap band . deserves special -mention, 
with its ‘Kazoos and its tootcrs. . .
In spite of all the campaigning 
of the Dean of Agriculture,, the 
Campus Queen was selected by 
student majority, but Fritz has 
avowed his intention of having-his 
own way next year. The corona­
tion was nothing at all like the 
informal plopping of- the crown 
on the Queen with the romping 
attendants bounding- hither and 
yon. No indeed, this was the most 
solemn of occasions; why,, at 10:25 
the stage for the event had not 
yet been completed. A half egg­
shell effect was the stage pro tem, 
beautifully decorated with pastel 
shades while her Majesty Isobel 
Sheppard snoozed 011 amid her me­
dieval surroundings—snoozed on 
too long, in fact, to suit Prince 
Charming, who promptly awakened 
her with a resounding smack. But 
we suspicion that the Queen's slum­
ber was disturbed before this, for 
the enterprising Art students on 
the roof above, had let down a 
volley of objects- designed to com-, 
bat Morpheus—i. c., By Bens in 
a state of turmoil, buckets of water, 
and shiny new pennies. Atmos­
phere was lent'" to the scene by a 
dancing chorus, clad . in fanciful 
cheese-cloth, who executed a series 
of gymnastic "exhibitions coupled 
with a rapid jaw movement—which 
was, we afterwards discovered, 
caused by a particularly gummy 
stick of Wrigley’s. The grass was 
littered with paper, pop bottles and 
spectators; the feminine of the 
species being borne aloft on the 
boulders of their counterpart. Red 
lights' blazed intermittently at the 
corners of the buildings, fantastic­
ally lighting up the figures on the 
roof.
The East Liberty 5 anel 10’s have 
remarked’ on the notable scarcity 
of rainbow-hued babv ribbon. “It,”
some'bne behind the counter sagfcly ' 
remarked, "must be honorary call 
day.” And so it was, with scores 
•of expectant ones lining the banks 
of* the outdoor theater. After the 
missing link was forged and the 
introductory speeches had been got­
ten over somehow, the real busi­
ness of the afternoon started-. Mor­
tar Board got rid of 12 cumber­
some hats, Cwens called the usual 
score or so of plebes to carry on 
their good work, and in everything 
else that elusive-spirit of fraternity 
prevailed as brother welcomed 
brother. Junior Proms* often have 
a devastating effect between Delta 
Skull .and Dragons, or so it seemed this year.
And so to the Costume Ball, 
where the”real ole spirit of former 
Campus Weeks was rampant. All 
the Japanese •lanterns had been 
torn down by fun-full ones, and 
perhaps the scarcity of light caused 
this cxluiberant feeling—who knows?
I he Gym and Union were peopled 
by fantastic people plowing around 
in conventional light attire, ir. 
draped sheets—Hell-cnistic fashion 
in a mixture of tux (top) anel Kiltie 
shirt (bottom) and in white ducks, 
with every cpnccivable pat color, 
the Dragons staging a lost public­
ity stunt with their workmen’.', 
shirts and gold-bug insignia.
The bloos singer Knocked us all 
out at the Cabaret Tea Dance; she 
evidently affected the tap dancer’s 
toe, for he ended his performance 
Avitli a nose dive fioor-wards, to the 
ribald amusement of the crowd. 
The orchestra was getting bcttci 
and it is our firm conviction that, 
had our carnival lasted a week 
longer, they would have been 
classed as a first-class band. The 
bar was indicative of the upwarei 
trend in college morality, for legal 
refreshments only were served.
And then, as a climax to the 
whole event—the "Show-Off” anc 
the loving cups were presented) 
The Betas captured three of tlierr 
and a D. U. trotted up third tc 
reccive his share, while the other 
fraternities fared well, receiving one.
And thus ends the story, with a 
postscript that, due to the absence 
of intoxicating liquor, we here pe­

ceiving campus weeks,
