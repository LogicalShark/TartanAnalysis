WUP WINS DUAL MEET
Last Saturday morning the Tech and Wup. 
track teams met on Friendship Park for a dual 
meet, partly to measure up the relative 
strengths of the two institutions and to get into 
form for the intercollegiate meet which will 
be held next Saturday, if it doesn’t rain.
The Tech team took the meet as a matter 
of course while the Wup. boys were working 
hard to win. They claim now that they were 
much crippled by the absence of Vieslet and 
Jamison. In the first event, the hundred yard 
dash, Tech expected first place but Quince Ban­
bury, who is showing remarkable form this 
year, managed to nose out a victory in this 
event. Our new man, Frampton, showed up 
well in the hurdles as did Griffith in the high 
and broad jump. The latter event, usually 
the slowest in a field meet, proved to be the 
most exciting of all as the entire meet hung 
upon this one event. Consequently every one 
stayed to see the finish. However, with the 
twenty-seven points handicap Wup had over 
us, due to our men not competing in the 
weight events, cut down to one point we may 
consider the meet in reality a Tech victory. 
The final score was 59—58 in favor of Wup.
The results are as follows:
100 yard dash—1st Q. Banbury, 2nd Hal- 
ferty, 3d Hosey. Time 102-5 seconds.
1 mile run—1st Bates, 2nd Knotts, 3rd Wylie. 
Time 4.52.
120 yard hurdles—1st Dowling, 2nd Solter, 
3rd Frampton. Time 182-5 seconds.
440 yard dash—1st Ross, 2nd Charles, 3rd 
Brown. Time 54 seconds.
220 yard dash—jst Banbury, 2nd Dowling, 
3rd Halferty. Time 23 2-5 seconds.
Half mile run—1st Bates, 2nd Wylie, 3rd 
Brown. Time 2.162-5.
220 yard hurdles—1st Dowling, 2nd Framp­
ton, 3rd Banbury. Time 283-5 seconds.
Pole vault—1 st Shoop, 2nd Richards, 3rd
Decker. Height 8 ft. 4^ in.
12-lb. shot put—1st Van Doren, 2nd Zieg, 
3rd Shuman. Distance 44 ft. ¿4 in.
16-lb. hammer throw—1st Zieg, 2nd Van 
Doren, 3rd Shuman. Distance 121 ft.
Running high jump—1st Griffith, 2nd Solter, 
3rd McCandless. Height 5 ft. 5 in.
Discus throw—1st Zieg, 2nd Van Doren, 3rd 
Shuman. Distance 99 ft., 7 in.
Running broad jump—1st Banbury, 2nd
Griffith, 3rd Boots. Distance 20 feet, 3*4 in.

TO ESTABLISH GRADUATE SCHOOL

Harvard to Start Training School for Business 
Administrators, Beginning Next 
School Year.
A Graduate School of Business Administra­
tion, in connection with Harvard university, 
is to be established, and will be ready for open­
ing at the beginning of the next college year. 
Edwin F. Gay, now professor of Economics 
at Harvard, is to be dean of the new depart­
ment.
The requirements for admission will be a 
bachelor’s degree, and the course of study 
will cover two years. The first year’s work 
will include several courses now presented by 
the department of economics in the college, 
such as commercial law, commercial organiza­
tion and economic geography. In the second 
year, new courses will be offered, and special 
instruction will be given in banking, transpor­
tation, insurance, business organization and 
management, and special elective studies giv­
ing particular attention to certain lines of 
business. While most of the work will be 
theoretical, it is planned to afford the students 
practical experience in the various branches 
of business. Dean Gay was graduated from 
the University of Michigan, 1900, and the Uni­
versity of Berlin, 1902. He has been connect­
ed with Harvard in-his present capacity since 
1906.—Chicago Daily Maroon.

CRIMINAL SOCIETY.
A new society has been formed at Tech and 
gives promise of becoming the most popular 
that has ever been started in this school.
Just at present the membership is mad;» 
up of Seniors and Juniors but we understand 
that there are some Plebes in school who are 
eligible. For any one to be eligible to 
membership he must have been arrested once 
during his college career at Tech—the nature 
of the offense not being taken into considera­
tion, preference, however, being given to 
those who have been pulled for walking on the 
grass in Schenley Park.
Buck Thomson was made temporary chair­
man and called the meeting to order. The 
following officers were elected:
President, John M. Provost; Vice Presi­
dent, Meldrim Thomson; Secretary, W. L. 
Sprengle; Treasurer, G. W. Fleishman; His­
torian, S. J. Kann.
It was decided to hold meetings once a 
month. A suitable pin will be obtained which 
will be symbolic of the organization.
Any one in school that is eligible will be ad­
mitted to membership—they will please hand 
their names to S. J. Kann
MANY COLLEGE DAILIES ENTER 
INTO POLITICS.
Eastern Student Publications Come Out in 
Interests of Various Candidates.
Several college dailies are entering into ac­
tive polities in giving support to various presi­
dential candidates. The Daily Princetonian 
has declared itself in favor of Judge Gray of 
Delaware, and is, with the exception of a 
weekly published at a Southern university, 
solely in the interests of Bryan, the only col­
lege paper standing for Democracy.
“We congratulate them upon getting into 
the contest with a candidate of such caliber,”
' The schedule of the Spring Entrance Ex­
amination for admission to the Night School 
is as follows :
Thursday, May 21—
7.00 P. M.—8.00 P. M.—Chemistry.
8.00 P. M.—9.30 P. M.—Algebra.
9.30 P. M.—11.00 P. M.—English.

In view of the fact that the lumber of the coun­
try is being used at a rate which it is impossible for 
the natural growth to supply or replenish, the Forest 
Service is doing an excellent service in forcibly di­
recting the attention of users of lumber to the sav­
ing made possible by inexpensive preservative treat­
ment. Fence posts, which under ordinary circum­
stances will last for two years, if given such a .treat­
ment, costing about 10 cents, will last 18 years. The 
game thing is true of railroad ties, telephone and tel­
egraph poles, etc. The universal adoption of the 
suggestion of the Forest Service, which is given in 
detail in circular 139 entitled “A Primer of Wood 
Preservation,” and which is obtainable at no expense, 
upon application to the Forester at the Forest Ser­
vice, Washington, D. C., would enormously decrease 
the demand upon the country’s timber supply.

The valley of Po-Shan is about 20 miles long 
and from 200 yards to six miles broad, according to 
United States Consular reports. The whole of this 
valley is a vast bed of coal, situate at a deeper level 
in the middle and appearing on the surface at the 
edges, where it has been forced upward by the pres­
sure against the limestone of the surrounding hills. 
At the northwest exit of the valley the coal bed is 
interrupted by a chain of limestone hills, but it com­
mences again and continues in undiminished quan­
tity in a westerly direction for another 20 miles. The 
best quality of anthracite is found near the surface 
of the Heisham Valley.' The Chinese have of late 
been unable to cope with the water in the shafts, 
and most of the mines have been shut down.

FRANK E. NEUDORFER.
The untimely death of Frank Edward Neu- 
dorfer, '08, has cast a spell of gloom over all 
of Tech. Having been ill but a very short time 
his death came as a complete surprise to all. 
He was taken to his bed with appendicitis on 
April 30 and was operated upon at the Co­
lumbia Hospital the following day. His con­
dition was one of steady improvement almost 
up to the time of his death, when ugly 
symptoms of blood poisoning made their ap­
pearance and from that time until the end he 
grew steadily worse.
Neudorfer was a prominent man in student 
activities, having been a member of the base 
ball and basket ball teams and captain of the 
latter for two seasons. He was prominent in 
the musical organizations and has been Vice 
President and Secretary of his class and Presi­
dent of the Investors Society, and is a member 
of the Sigma Rho Fraternity.
At a meeting of the class 1908 011 Monday 
afternoon suitable resolutions were drawn up 
to be sent to the bereaved parents.
His death removes from the class one of its 
brightest members and one who would prob­
ably have stood first when the honors were 
awarded. Although he was not what is known 
as a “popular” man he was an invaluable help 
to the members-of his section, as any assist­
ance he could lend with a difficult problem 
wyas always quickly forthcoming. There are

those who owe their removal of conditions to 
his efforts to show them the mystery of the 
calculus, while in the laying out of work he 
was always regarded as a leader and one who 
could plan and carry out what was to be done. ---------o---------
INTERCOLLEGIATE MEET.
Tech has had enough of near victories in 
track events. Last Saturday W. U. P. won the 
dual meet because Tech was unable to win a 
single point in any of the weight events. Such 
a defeat would be a victory if we had nobody 
qualified to compete in the weights; but we 
have men that although not world beaters 
could hold their own with the men they would 
meet in these events in any local meet. We 
hope that the men who failed to qualify last 
Saturday simply 011 account of lack of practice 
will be able to do something for their school 
in the intercollegiate meet next Saturday. Some 
of the men who last week woke up to the fact 
that they might, with a little practice, be point 
winners have been out practicing the first two 
days of this week. While one week is a short 
time to do much we feel that at least two of 
them will be able to do something for them­
selves and the school at their next appearance.
With any help at all from the weight men 
Tech can win this meet, as our runners will 
certainly be able to trim most anything that 
the other colleges can put up and we stand 
more than an even show in the jumps and 
pole vault. So get together, fellows, and bring 
home a victory as it means much to us.

JUNIORS PROM. IS ENJOYED BY ALL.
The first annual Junior Prom, of the M. M. 
C. S. was held last Friday evening in the gym­
nasium of the school. The evening was quite 
warm and, in spite of the electric fans installed 
to keep the dancers cool, wilted collars were 
much in evidence. The gymnasium was very 
prettily decorated with boughs and smilax; 
the lights in the halls and lunch room were 
covered with thistle shades, while pink and 
white carnations were on the tables in the 
lunch room.
The dances were somewhat novel, chief 
among which were the moon dances, one to 
the electric moon hung at one end of the hall, 
and the other to a large ’09 electrically lighted 
at the other end.
The first cotillion was led by Miss Catherine 
Ihmsen and James Herron, and the favors 
were large paper hats for the boys and butter­
fly bows for the girls. The second was led by 
Miss Mary Pfeil and W alter Pfeil and the 
favors were green and lavender boas for the 
girls and neckties of the same shade for the 
boys. The favors for the third cotillion were 
silver thistle pins for all and was led by Miss 
Henrietta Alcorn and James Armstrong. The 
fourth was a confetti figure, led by Miss Lucy 
Connell and William Wallace. Supper was 
served at twelve in the lunch room, and the 
dance was over at about 2’30.
The patronesses were Mrs. A. A. Hamer- 
schlag, Miss West, and Miss Smith. The com­
mittee deserves great congratulation for their 
efforts to make this final social affair a suc­
cess.
GLEE CLUB.
What has become of our chorus of Night- 
en gales?
The Glee Club is a very important factor 
in our school, and should be fostered until it 
grows strong enough to stand alone, lo do 
this we must work hard. Regular attendance 
is a necessary feature. Be present, not only 
when the Club’s picture is taken, but at every 
practice also. If YOU are a member COME, 
for you are needed.

12THE TARI AX
THE NIGHT SCHOOL IS CLOSED.w\0^0\0\0Nv\0Nv\0%0N0\vN0\0N0V:*V:»\0\
On JKriday, May 8th, the night departments 
closed the third year of their existence; the 
last week being devoted to very little cele­
bration and a great deal of hard work 011 the 
part of the students getting through with ex­
aminations and removing conditions. The 
day students as a body do not realize the im­
portance of the night departments, but will 
perhaps have some idea of the great number 
of students attending. Carnegie Tech is lead­
ing the colleges of the country in the introduc­
tion of night courses especially in the applied 
science division. Any student who has suf­
ficient backbone to attend his classes four or 
five nights in the week, after working hard all 
day, is sure to be well acquainted with hard­
ship and, consequently, though the amount of 
learning he obtains will not equal that to be 
had in the day courses the self-denial he must 
practice will stand him in good stead for the 
balance. Very few night students are for­
tunate enough to be able to take part in all 
the student activities, with the notable ex­
ception of the glee and mandolin clubs, but 
night men have been fairly well represented in 
athletics during the past year. Williams of 
the football team, Cocken of the hockey team, 
and Leety of the basketball and hockey teams 
are noted examples who have shown up as 
good as any day man. Some of the brightest 
matter printed in the Tartan is written by 
night students and we miss their wit this week 
especially. Altogether the night school is as 
important as the day school in both studies 
and organizations.
SOME COMMENCEMENT EXPRES­
SIONS
Inasmuch as commencement is but four 
weeks hence it may not be out of place to 
summarize at this time a few of the ideas, that 
precedent has it, must be presented at that occasion:
“It has been twenty-five years since I gradu­
ated from college.”
*‘I had 110 such opportunities as you now possess.”
“You do not realize your opportunities.” 
The keynote of success (mark cross after 
keynote selected) : Honesty, uprightness,
sobriety, personality, good mixer (with men), 
originality, hard work, bluff, courage of your 
convictions.
That Cruel Dean!—Right here, it might be 
stated that bridge whist is barred at the Uni­
versity of Cincinnati. The co-eds protested 
that the most they ever played for were tooth­
picks, but with the stern dean it made no 
difference.
