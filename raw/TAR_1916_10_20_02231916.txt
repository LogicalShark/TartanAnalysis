National Honorary Engineering Fra­
ternity Places Chapter Here.
On Saturday night, February 19, 
1916, the Tau Beta Pi Association 
chartered at Carnegie Tech their 
Pennsylvania Gamma Chapter. This 
was the culmination of the efforts to 
have at Tech some good honorary fra­
ternity, such as exists at the best 
Technical Colleges of the country, 
in order to mark in some fitting way 
high scholarship.
The ceremony of initiation was fol­
lowed by an installation banquet at 
the Hotel Schenley, of which the 
menu and the toasts will be found at 
the end of this article. It ought to 
be mentioned that Professor R. C. 
Matthews, president of the Univer­
sity of Tennessee, made the principal 
speech of the after dinners, and both 
through his talk and that of Dean 
Leete’s, the cigars of the listeners 
went out. Other of our faculty, such 
as Professor Hower and Mr. Blais- 
dell also made interesting and witty 
talks.

28th in Motor Square Garden.
News has been received from the 
Middle Atlantic Association of the 
Amateur Athletic Union that the in­
door championships have been award­
ed to Carnegie Tech for this winter.
Practically all arrangements for con­
ducting the meet have been made by 
Manager Schwerin of the track team. 
Since Duquesne Garden was no long­
er obtainable, Motor Square Garden 
was the only place of sufficient size. 
Manager Schwerin will be assisted in 
his plans by Commissioner J. T. Tay­
lor, and handicapper, W. S. Haddock, 
both members of the A. A. U. March 
28th is the date decided upon.
The meet, being the only one held 
here this winter should prove a gala 
event in Pittsburgh’s sporting world. 
The success of the meet is of course 
a foregone conclusion. Stars from 
parts of New Jersey, Delaware, and 
West Virginia, and the entire state of 
Pennsylvania will be present to make 
the thing a great success. From 
around Pittsburgh, Tech, Pitt, West-

RESIGNATION OF BUSINESS 
MANAGER.
Due to the press of school work 
preliminary to graduation, Mr. A. S. 
Cowan, for two years business man­
ager of the Tartan, has felt compelled 
to resign from his position on the 
board. Paul Emmil, former secretary 
to the business manager, has kindly 
consented to take the position until 
the election of the new board in April, 
when he announced on undertaking 
the responsibilities, he would feel that 
the demands of his other activities and 
school work during his Senior year 
would compel him to turn over the 
office to a successor.
TOMORROW NIGHT.
Thistles, home concerts, football 
trips, and other demands for money 
come and go every year but it is sel­
dom that our students are asked to 
give to a worthy outside cause, espe­
cially when they receive back in en­
tertainment many times the value of 
the money expended.
The reasons why every student of 
this institution should obligate him­
self to be present at the theatre to­
morrow night should be of a com­
pelling nature. Beside the fact that 
each one should contribute his mite 
to the needs of the desolate war suf­
ferers, the appreciation that should 
be shown for the hard work being 
done by those responsible for the 
enterprise among the administration 
faculty and students, the pleasant in­
terruption in the week by an evening’s 
entertainment away from thoughts of 
class room, laboratary, and school 
book, stands out a duty that each 
and every student and faculty member 
owes to this institution; that of al­
ways bending all his or her available 
energies toward the successful com­
pletion of any enterprise undertaken 
by this institution whose success re­
flects upon its good name.
In this instance all that is neces­
sary for each in order to have done 
his or her part is to be present, any­
where in the house, at the only gath­
ering of its kind to be held this year. 
The desire is to have tomorrow night 
a big Tech party and that as little 
room as possible be filled by outsiders 
who would not contribute to that 
spirit which will be present.
No reason can be imagined for stay­
ing away. The hackneyed excuse of 
the pressure of school work cannot 
be applied, so early in this semester, 
with Saturday and Sunday following. 
The lack of funds cannot affect one’s 
abilities to be present. No one is 
expected to occupy the higher priced 
seats if he does not feel able, but 
there is no man who cannot afford 
the other extreme. True, it might 
mean a little denial as in the case of 
school work, but is it not worth it? 
The only remaining excuse is lack of 
interest and to any such we can only 
offer our heart-felt sympathy.
We well remember, the feelings of 
those who missed the last Tech party, 
held at Carnegie Music Hall the last 
school year. Those who are absent 
tomorrow, and we trust they will be 
few, will learn later that they have 
not availed themselves of one of the 
too few opportunities afforded to us 
here, to be present, when all the stu­
dents are under one roof, with one 
common cause, and when that peculiar 
psychic influence is to be felt which 
is present at any great gathering 
where all hearts are pulsing towards 
a common end.
TAU BETA PI.
The founding of a chapter of Tau 
Beta Pi Fraternity in Carnegie 
marks another step towards the top. 
Tau Beta Pi is a national honorary 
fraternity in engineering. It was 
founded at Lehigh in 1885. Carnegie’s 
chapter, called the Pennsylvania Gam­
ma, is the third in this state, the oth­
ers being at Penn State and Lehigh.
The engineering students have 
something to work for now aside 
from mere average attainment. They 
should take advantage of this chance 
and attain the honor which is await­
ing them. The conditions are sim­
ple and the goal is in reach of 
the best—it only remains with the stu­
dents now. Tau Beta Pi is the in­
centive for better scholarship. Go 
after it.
DEBATE ON PREPAREDNESS.
On Thursday, March 2, a debate 
will be held between Messrs Benj. 
Schwartz and Maurice Resnick on the 
question “Do we need preparedness?”

COMMUNICATION.
To the Editor of The Tartan:
One often hears the cry that col­
lege is out of touch with the world. 
One of the chief marks of difference 
between college and the world is the 
difference in conversation. Sports are 
all right; but college men ought to 
be more interested in points of view 
than they are.
Even with the dullest associates, the 
most arid teachers, no student need 
despair of association with electric 
personalities. There is today a con­
siderable mass of periodical literature 
which exists not for the distribution 
of miscellaneous advertisements, com­
mercialized illustrations and equally 
commercialized stories, but for the 
unhampered setting forth of points of 
view. Such publications are at times 
highly invigorating. They make us 
think. They make us see with new 
eyes. The world and its sojourners 
are more interesting, and life worth 
more, after we read them. They rob 
individuality of isolation.
William Marion Reedy, of “Reedy’s 
Mirror,” St. Louis, has a habit of 
anticipating what people will be talk­
ing of three or four years hence. 
Sometimes he furnishes them with the 
material. There is no more astute 
editor in the United States today. 
The men who were enabled a few 
years ago to begin the publication of 
“The New Republic,” in New York, 
have made that weekly indispensable 
to all who like vigorous comment on 
the drama of passing events. Few of 
their readers die of boredom. Nor 
does that disagreeable death overtake 
those who read “The Masses,” a 
monthly edited by Max Eastman, with 
John Sloan as art editor, which de­
scribes itself correctly as “frank, arro­
gant, impertinent,” with an editorial 
policy “to do as it pleases and con- 
cilliate nobody, not even its readers.”
One cannot read “Poetry: A Maga­
zine of Verse,’’ without being glad 
that such a person as Miss Harriet 
Monroe is alive. She has herself 
done much to interpret phases of 
modern life; and she fosters many 
young writers, who are making of to­
day the poetry of to-morrow. 
“Poetry“ is published in Chicago, as is 
also “The Little Review,” edited by 
the astonishing Miss Anderson and 
published when she has the money; 
and “The Public,” a courageous week­
ly for years edited by Louis F. Post, 
and now in the hands of his associ­
ates.
The mind recurs to “The Ground 
Hog,” published by David Gibson, in 
Cleveland; to “The Unpopular Re­
view and The Nation,” both published 
in New York; to English periodicals 
like “The English Review,” “The 
Egoist,” “The Hibbert Journal;” and 
to many other publications of this 
type, dedicated to art, or to the free 
expression of thought and criticism.
“What porridge had John Keats?” 
asks Browning. One is moved to 
speculate upon what undergraduate 
life would be, if undergraduates fed 
on porridge such as is to be found in 
periodicals like the above.
Faithfully yours,
H. C. LONG.
BACK NUMBERS OF TARTAN 
DESIRED.
Any person having copies of num­
bers 32 and 34 of last year’s Tartan 
dated May 20th and June 3rd, and of 
the issue for February 13, 1913, will 
render the board a great favor if they 
will render us the same.
The complete files of last year’s 
Tartans were destroyed during the 
summer owing to the stupidity of the 
czar of the institution’s janitorial serv­
ice. This irreparable loss has left 
only one file of last year’s issues re­
maining, so that any additions will 
be highly appreciated.
THISTLE NOTICE.
All organizations contracting for 
space in the 1916 Thistle, who have 
not already turned in their copy for 
the book, must have it in the hands 
of the Editor on or before Friday, 
February 25, to insure its position in 
the book. This will be the last day 
that copy will be accepted. Drop it 
in the C. I. T. postoffice. Everybody 
that has outstanding material get busy 
and get it in NOW. We are just 
about ready for press.

NOTES
On Wednesday, February 23, a lec­
ture will be given by George R. Wal­

and brilliant speaker.
The lecture will begin at 4:30 P. 
M., and will be held at room 104 Ap­
plied.
Here is what Prof. Willett said 
about him. Wallace: “He is un­
doubtedly one of the best speakers
I ever heard and he will certainly hold 
every one present anchored to his or 
her seat until the end of the lecture.”
The subject of the lecture is “Civic 
Ideals.”
A recent statement issued by the 
Board of Trade of the City of Syra­
cuse shows that the University now 
brings $4,000,000 to the city annually.
J. C. MACE ADDRESSES CAR­
NEGIE Y. M. C. A.
Delivers Lively and Interesting Talk.
Among the best of the speakers that 
have been heard at Tech this year 
was Mr. James C. Mace of the Cen­
tral Y. M. C. A., who spoke before 
the Carnegie branch last Sunday. His 
address dealt with the deeper things 
in life and he put them forth in a 
way that held the interest of those 
who heard, from beginning to end. 
His speech was full of many humor­
ous episodes, which were always 
good for a laugh and his impersona­
tions of some of his characters were 
excellent. The chief point he made 
was that a man can be anything that 
he thinks he can be. Deep thinking 
and our freedom of though led him to 
believe that man can be immortal.
Plans have not as yet been com­
pleted for the next meeting. An­
nouncements will, however, be posted 
on the bulletin boards or appear in 
next week’s Tartan. ¦

carefully costumed according to the 
demands of the play, which calls for 
German, French and English uni­
forms, and a? a side issue there will

self-government includes, the proper 
and courteous relation of faculty and 
students, and of upperclassmen and 
plebes; also whether senorities are a 
good thing for the school.
A joint committee of faculty and 
students compiled these questions and 
presented them to the girls in the 
hope of receiving some suggestions 
with regard to their solution. During 
the hour, the three faculty members 
of the committee, Miss Sturtevant, 
Miss Belleville and Miss Collet, spoke 
on groups of these questions in order 
to give the girls an idea which prin­
ciples were involved. Miss Sturte­
vant spoke on Self-Government, giv­
ing opinions of other schools on the 
subject, and explaining what it would 
mean to have it for all four classes. 
Miss Belleville spoke on Courtesy, 
emphasizing the need of quiet in 
classrooms, in the halls during classes, 
etc. Miss Collet spoke about rules 
in the dormitory, whether Self-Gov­
ernment should be included in their 
affairs; also whether sororities were 
or were not a good thing.
An opportunity was then given to 
ask questions on any doubtful point. 
Immediately after, the faculty left the 
room and the questions were open for 
discussion. Several good suggestions 
were made, but for the most part, time 
was lost in quibbling over small 
points.
However, each girl was given a 
chance to say what she thought be­
fore handing in her answers. Every­
one is urged to think hard before 
deciding each question, to try to give 
the best possible solution to each one, 
without being partial in the least de­
gree.
Miss Collett and Miss Hayden, of 
the M. M. C. S. Science Department, 
entertained the Senate at dinner in 
their home, on Wightman street, Feb­
ruary IS, 1916. The entire Senate was 
present, as well as the faculty com­
mittee, Miss Sturtevant, Miss Belle­
ville and Miss Collett. Weighty prob­
lems of the day were discussed and 
at six o’clock a mighty fine dinner was 
served. The Senate certainly extends 
a vote of thanks to Mrs. Hayden, Miss 
Hayden and Miss Collett, for the 
nicest, most enjoyable meeting it has 
had this year.
The evening of Friday, February 18, 
1916, will long be remembered by all 
who were present at the Junior Prom, 
for everything seemed perfect and all 
had a delightful time. The Seniors, 
who were the guests of the Juniors, 
expressed themselves very forcibly 
when speaking of the enjoyable even­
ing. The faculty members, who were 
present, also said very complimentary 
things about the way in which the 
Prom, was conducted.
The Prom, was held in Carnegie 
Union, which looked very much 
“dressed up” with all the fair ladies 
in lovely gowns and the immaculately 
dressed men, moving through it. The 
hall on the second floor, furnished 
with comfortable chairs and decorated 
with palms, afforded a very delight­
ful retreat where some of the less en­
ergetic might “sit out” dances when 
they so desired.
At 9:30, after two preliminary 
dances, the grand march was led by 
the social chairman, Miss Regine Ja­
cob, with her partner, Mr. A. E. Hell- 
strom. Seventy-five couples followed 
and passed the receiving line which 
consisted of Dean Breed, Miss Dem- 
arest, Mrs. Vermorcken, Miss Mason, 
Miss Ernst, the senior class presi­
dent, Miss Grace Searight and the 
junior class president, Miss Margaret 
Wirth.
Twelve dances followed, after 
which supper was served in the base­
ment, which was very attractively 
decorated. The table decorations 
consisted of red and white carnations 
and red candles. Banks of palms 
screened off the part of the room not 
u^ed. The supper was very tasty and 
the surprise came at the end when 
small molds, of George and Martha 
Washington and tiny gunboats, made 
of pink and white ice cream, were 
served. The color scheme worked out 
in red, white and blue, was very sug­
gestive just at this time of the year 
and month.
After supper all again assembled 
upstairs and dancing was continued 
until 2 a. m. When the strains of the 
home waltz were heard everyone’s 
face became very long, for the pro­
gram had not been finished and all 
were very much disappointed.
The music was furnished by a four- 
piece orchestra, under the direction of 
J. Oliver Riehl. After supper Mr. 
Riehl was at the piano himself and 
the music certainly was snappy. The 
extra immediately after supper was 
appreciated by all and everyone was 
talking about the pianist.
The saxaphone player also deserves 
special mention, the full deep tones 
of his instrument reached everyone’s 
heart and also their feet.
The programs were of blue suede 
with the Carnegie seal in gold, for
the men they consisted of memoran­
dum pads, and for the ladies, picture 
frames.
The social chairman, Miss Jacob, 
deserves much credit for the way the 
affair was carried off and her assist­
ants, Miss Wassell, Miss Carmichael, 
Miss Wakefield, Miss Dearing and 
Miss Wilson also deserve a great deal 
of praise for their good work. The 
Junior president, Miss Wirth, who had 
to keep everyone busy and happy, 
should not be forgotten.
Junior Proms will probably be held 
by the Margaret Morrison girls as 
long as time goes on, but never can 
there be one which will be prettier, 
more enjoyed by all or more success­
ful in every respect.
NOTED SPEAKER AT M. M. C. S.
Dr. Alexander Johnson Talks.
Through the efforts of the Depart­
ment of Social Work, Margaret Mor­
rison was extremely fortunate in se­
curing Dr. Alexander Johnson of 
Philadelphia to speak to the girls. Dr. 
Johnson is the field secretary of the 
committee on provision for the feeble­
minded, and is a most interesting and 
delightful talker. On Wednesday at 
10:30 he spoke to the girls of the 
Social Work and Home Arts and 
Crafts Departments on “Special 
Training for Work with Defectives,” 
emphasizing the necessity of allow­
ing the feeble-minded to work with 
their hands instead of their heads. 
What is mostly needed is great sym­
pathy and patience, for it is only by 
these methods that anything worth 
while can be accomplished.
In the afternoon an informal recep­
tion took place in the Faculty Par­
lors, at which Dr. Johnson spoke on 
“How Shall We Educate the Feeble­
minded Child?” This was given to 
the Faculty and a specially invited 
group.
On Thursday morning he spoke on 
“the Spirit of Institutional Life,” ex­
plaining and giving remedies for the 
many problems of management in in­
stitutions. Many interesting stories 
from his own experience, which is very 
rich and varied, brought out most viv­
idly the principles he wished to il­
lustrate. Immediately after, Dr. John­
son addressed the whole school in a 
general assembly, the topic being, 
“The Feeble-minded Girl and Her 
Fatherless Child.” The lecture was 
accompanied by stereopticon views 
which made the arguments set forth 
very convincing and positive.
Luncheon was served in the “Little 
House” for Dr. Johnson, at which 
faculty members especially interested, 
were invited.
Besides the lectures in our own 
school Dr. Johnson also gave several 
outside talks, of which the most not­
able were two at the University of 
Pittsburgh, and one before the Social 
Workers’ Club.
Dr. Johnson is very sincere and 
deeply interested in his work. One 
cannot help feeling that he is really 
accomplishing something worth while 
when he undertakes to educate and 
protect these feeble-minded folk who 
through misfortunes not entirely their 
own have come to a lower level in

One of the extremely charming fea­

Last Wednesday the Student As­
sembly was honored by the presence 
of Dr. Wm. M. Davidson, Superin­
tendent of the Pittsburgh Public 
Schools, who gave us a most interest­
ing talk.
Another Carnegie Letter Day is to 
be held this year, sometime during the 
coming month. The plans are al­
ready under way and let us make it 
even a greater success than the one 
of last year.
The recent action of the Student 
Assembly has caused the placing of a 
number of “No Smoking in This 
Building” signs about the Industries 
School.
Mr. G. W. Lyon, instructor in Eng­
lish, represented Dean Connelley as 
a judge, at an oratorical contest held 
recently at the Tabernacle Presbyter­
ian Church.
The Plebe Class held a spirited 
meeting last Thursday afternoon. 
Baird was elected to the Student Sen­
ate to fill the vacancy left by O. A. 
Doffert, who has transferred to Night 
School. A committee was appointed 
to take up the question of whether or 
not hazing shall prevail for the incom­
ing Plebes in September.
Several plebes who, heretofore 
dared attend classes without the reg­
ulation apparel, were treated rather 
roughly at the hands of the Middle 
Class.
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS TALKS.
Dr. Davidson Addresses Student As­
sembly.
Considerable interest was given Dr. 
Davidson’s general talk before the 
student body of the School of Ap­
plied Industries Assembly last Wed­
nesday. Starting with a discussion on 
the development of civic interest 
through the various periods of his­
tory, he culminated with a forceful 
presentation of the effects upon pres­
ent day life of the acts of Abraham 
Lincoln and George Washington in 
behalf of their country. A rousing 
cheer closed the meeting.
There seems to be some misappre­
hension on the part of the student 
body as to what activity the Social 
committee is planning on. The com­
mittee was appointed far back in De­
cember, but thus far nothing has been 
decided upon. The assembly Execu­
tive Committee, under whose author­
ity the Social committee was appoint­
ed, unanimously passed a motion re­
cently that, unless a specific report 
be made indicating that that commit­
tee intends to fulfill its obligation, it 
shall be dissolved and a new one ap­
pointed. It has not been customary

for students appointed to fall down 
in their duties such as those on this 
committee have,"but it is for the in­
terests of the general student body 
that unless immediate action be taken 
and an affair of some kind be arrang­
ed, a new set of men be called upon.
TAU BETA PI AT TECH
Continued from Page 1
Of the one hundred and fifty or 
so members in the vicinity of Pitts­
burgh, about twenty were present at 
this occasion. No doubt many times 
this many would have been on hand 
had it not been for the extremely 
short notice it was possible to give 
them. As it was, many of the men 
who stand high in the engineering 
world were there, such as C. R. Dooley 
of the Westinghouse Educational De­
partment, and F. D. Hallock, perhaps 
the foremost authority in the country 
on motor control. Besides these, 
other alumni members were H. D. Mc­
Kinney, University of Colo.; A. H. 
Blaisdell, University of Maine; R. C. 
Matthews, University of Illinois; H. 
S. Hower, Case; J. D. Bradford, Ar­
mour Institution of Technology; H. 
L. Cole, A. R. Leavitt, H. A. Randall, 
F. A. Simmons, all of Worcester 
Polytechnic Institute; S. R. Shave, 
University of Washington; W. W. 
Stevenson, Kentucky State Univer­
sity; F. W. Heisley, Cornell; D. W. 
Perry, Kentucky State University; H. 
L. Miller, E. L. Eberhart, C. R. Doo­
ley, L. H. Harris, from Purdue, and 
F. D. Hallock from Lehigh.
The Tau Beta Pi Association has 
thirty chapters, and a present total 
membership of about 6600. It was 
founded at Lehigh University in June 
of 1885, by Edward H. Wiliams, then 
a professor at Lehigh. The insignia 
is a small watch key of gold about 
an inch high, shaped like the bent of 
a trestle. The charter membership 
at Tech is made up of sixteen Sen­
iors whose names appear below.
Membership to the association is 
drawn from the Junior and Senior 
classes of the engineering school 
only. The man standing highest in 
his class as determined by his first 
two years’ work is eligible at the be­
ginning of his Junior year, the upper 
eighth of the Junior class are eligible 
at the beginning of the second semes­
ter, and the upper quarter of the 
Senior class as determined by their 
first three years’ work at the begin­
ning of the Senior year. From these 
men, the membership is chosen by the 
chapter. *
The existence of Tau Beta Pi here 
ought to be an ever present stimulus 
to underclassmen to scholarship not 
just enough to slip through on, but of 
the highest grade. It makes the stu­
dent who qualifies a member of a 
great body of engineers who stand at 
the head of their profession, and such 
association is sure to be helpful. The

DRAMA NOTE.
the class and Mr. Maude returned to 
his theater leaving a happy and hope­
ful band of students.
THE DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC.
Mr. Maude a Guest at “The Liars.”
After the performance of “The 
Liars” Friday afternoon, tea was 
served on the stage in honor of Cyril 
Maude, who played “Grumpy” at the 
Nixon and his company who were the 
honor guests at the performance.
After being introduced by Director 
Hamerschlag, Mr. Maude gave a short 
informal talk to members of the caste 
wherein he gave helpful personal crit­
icisms with due apologies and charm. 
He spoke upon the splendid technic 
and stage presence of the caste in 
general and commented especially up­
on the work of Misses Guy and Bar­
ton and Messrs. Williamson and Mc­
Connell; predicting excellent futures 
for all if they attended to a few mat­
ters of voice and diction.
After his informal talk Mr. Maude 
read his famous speech on advice to 
young actors, and captivated truly 
the regard and admiration of “Tech” 
dramatic students.
He told us that the stage is the 
home of the great fraternity of actors, 
noted the world over for their ex­
treme kindness and generosity to each 
other. The fiercest light of publicity 
shines upon the actor and things 
which he does, sometimes no matter 
how innocently are misinterpreted 
and grossly magnified in public opin­
ion. This condition demands careful 
modification of the habits and actions 
of the actor.
Unselfishness, kindness, concentra­
tion, promptness, hard work and mod­
esty are demanded of the actor who 
is to be successful with the public and 
with his brother actors alike.
The actor is the true ambassador of 
his country. It is he who presents 
the best that his country holds. It is 
the duty of the young American ac­
tor to interpret to the world the best 
and greatest of his beloved republic.
Mr. Viehman, president of the de­
partment, expressed the gratitude of
Mr. J. O. Vick O’Brien, director of 
the Department of Music, has an­
nounced a series of Sunday evening 
recitals, in the Theater of Applied 
Design, to be given by the students. 
The opening recital was given on Sun­
day evening, February 13th, before 
an appreciative and fair-sized audi­
ence.
The program was opened with Mo­
zart’s “Molto Allegro from Quartette 
in G Major” (for strings), and proved 
a very interesting number, being a 
demonstration of most excellent en­
semble playing, while exhibiting’ a 
certain musicianship and careful train­
ing as regards shading, interpretation 
and finish. Right here, one would call 
attention to the excellence of the 
Greige music given by the strings of 
the orchestra, as entre-act music at 
the last three performances of the De­
partment of Drama. The fact that 
Mr. Malchereck conducts, carries 
with it the assurance that the per­
formance will be as near perfection 
as close criticism and severe training 
can make it, with the material in 
hand.
The program presented several new 
performers who proved themselves 
worthy of a hearing. Miss Dorothy 
Manner (violin) played two Mozart 
numbers: (a) Larghetto, (b), Men- 
uet, in which she displayed a splendid 
technique, much feeling and an un­
derstanding of nuance, remarkable in 
so young a musician. She was most 
cordially received.
Miss Eshelman, (piano) made a 
very favorable first impression, with 
her playing of the first movement of 
McDowell’s “Concerto in A,” (Mr. 
Jensen at the second piano). She 
possessed a sure attack and elicited 
from her instrument a clear, strong 
tone without hardness and gave an 
intelligent interpretation of this num­
ber.
Miss Adele Hennig furnished the 
popular numbers on the programme, 
playing most sympathetically, the al­
ways lovely Schubert “Impromptu in 
G,” and the brilliant “Rigoletto-Par- 
aphrase”—Verdi-Liszt. Her work re­
veals an improvement in poise and 
finish since last season.
Mr. Emil Gluck, whose work of last 
year is pleasantly remembered, re­
ceived a most hearty welcome and 
gave the novelties of the program— 
Dvorak-Kreisler’s “Indian Lament” 
and Coleridge-Taylor’s “African 
Dance.” This last composition gath­
ers interest as being the work of the 
only one of the composer’s race who 
has reached anything approaching 
what may prove an abiding fame in 
the realm of music.
These numbers revealed Mr. Gluck’s 
art from an entirely new angle, as 
heretofore he has interpreted only the 
works of the romantic and classic 
schools, while here was something dis­
tinctly bizarre in effect, which he suc­
ceeded in making very interesting 
through variety of tone color, at times 
weirdly plaintive and again grotesque.
Miss Shuman’s playing of the first 
movement of the Piano Concerto by 
Robt. Schumann, (Mr. Jensen at the 
second piano) was a very creditable 
performance.
The programme closed with the first 
movement of Lalo’s “Symphonie Es- 
pagnole” (violin) by Mr. Horace I. 
Brown, whose work is always charac­
terized by sure attack and pure tone 
and which bears the earmarks of the 
intellectual musician to whom feeling 
is a secondary consideration. His 
work is always given with perfect bal­
ance and if a little cold, one rests 
assured that when once he feels him­
self mjaster of his instrument the 
warmer side of the musician will de­
velop.
The recital reflects great credit on 
this department.

PLEBE ELECTION.
On Thursday, February 17, the 
Plebe class of the Design School held 
an election of officers. Those elected 
to office for the following year were 
as follows:
President, J. G. Todd.
Vice President, Carl B. Cease.
Secretary, Mable Beadling.
Treasurer, Ralph M. Crosby.
Historian, A. J. Miller.
Senator, Clyde J. Schumacher.
Sargeant-at-Arms, Adelia Forn- 
crook.
The Plebes also made arrangements 
to hold a dance in Union on February 
26th. This affair is for Plebes and es­
corts only. There was also a move­
ment carried to award the members 
of the Plebe basketball team with 
class numerals. The class team hav­
ing won the championship of the De­
sign School league.
The Design Plebes have made ar­
rangements for an informal dance to 
be held on February 26th, in the Un­
ion. The Plebe class of the Design 
School take this opportunity to ex­
tend a most cordial invitation to the 
Science School Plebes to attend. A 
small admission of SO cents per couple 
is asked to help cover expenses. The 
dance is for Plebes and their escorts 
only. Tickets in the Science School 
may be obtained from James Toler, 
Jr., Science Plebe.
A team of twleve men from Leland 
Stanford will be sent east in the 
Spring to compete in the intercolle­
giate track and field championships.

NEW COURSE IN CHEMISTRY.
Coal Tar Chemistry by Dr. James.
Upon request of a number of men 
engaged in the by-product coke in­
dustry of this district, who feel the 
need of special instruction in the ele­
ments of Coal Tar Chemistry, the 
School of Applied Science has de­
cided to offer a brief course of lec­
tures upon the subject. The course 
will be given by Dr. James, the head 
of our Department of Chemistry, and 
will require attendance one evening 
each week until the close of the night 
school May 1st.
This course is intended to give 
those men who are working in the 
various by-product coke plants of this 
district the opportunity to attend lec­
tures which will take up the more im­
portant chemical points in connection 
with the manufacture of the by-prod- 
ucts from coal. The problem of com­
bustion and simple calculation con­
nected with recuperator practice will 
also be covered.
The course will close with a few 
lectures on the coal tar colors, syn­
thetic drugs, and photographic chem­
icals, etc., etc.
The time required is from 8:30 to 
10:30 on Tuesday nights. Already 
over fifty young men from the various 
plants around this district have en­
rolled and become enthusiastic stu­
dents.
PROF. WORK DELIVERS PAPER 
AT NEW YORK MEETING 
OF A. I. E. E.
Prof. William R. Work of the Elec­
trical Engineering Department, at­
tended the mid-winter convention of 
the A. I. E. E. in New Yorp, Febru­
ary 8 and 9. The meeting was de­
voted to discussion of high tension 
phenomena and apparatus. Prof. 
Work delivered a paper on the meas­
urement of high voltages which con­
tained very much interesting matter. 
The data was gathered this last sum­
mer by the use of the 100 K. V. A.; 
200,000 volt transformer in the high 
tension laboratory, in Machinery Hall. 
Those interested in Prof. Work’s pa­
per may find it in the proceedings of 
the convention.
SECTION G. NOTES.
During the last month, Section “G” 
of the class of 1919 has been laying 
a foundation for a literary society. 
A constitution has been formed by 
the members of the above stated sec­
tion. They believe that this consti­
tution will serve as a foundation, on 
which a literary society can be built 
that shall promote rapid and lifelong 
progress among the students of C. 
I. T.
Section “G” of the present Plebe
class, has realized the great impor­
tance of an engineer’s ability to speak 
in public, and therefore, has taken 
definite steps to provide means by 
which the students of C. I. T. can 
acquire this ability.
At the last meeting of the Section, 
February 11, 1916, it was voted that 
this society have regular meetings 
every two weeks. The following offi­
cers were elected: Sprager, Pres.,
Shumway, secretary, and Roberts, 
treasurer.
Will all readers of the Tartan kind­
ly notice in the future, all progress 
made by the Literary Society of C. 
I. T. Secretary.
SCIENCE NOTES.
The Junior Class held their mid­
year election last week at which meet­
ing the following officers were elect­
ed:
President—Madison.
Vice President—Kesner.
Secretary—Borland.
T reasurer—Carnegie.
NIGHT SCIENCE MEN TURNED 
LOOSE.
Large Delegation at Junior Prom.
At least some of the night men are 
able to enjoy a good time when they 
take a “night off.” Those of them 
who attended the Junior Prom, last 
Friday certainly gave evidence of be­
ing able to do so, and supplied their 
full quota to the abundance of good 
spirits that everywhere prevailed that 
evening.
Perhaps, if their representative, Mr. 
McMichaels, had been able to per­
suade the others of the committee 
that the inclusion of an occasional 
old-timer in the program would not 
have been objectionable to any one, 
the night representation might have 
got the “at home” feeling a little 
quicker, but, once they had gained 
their sea legs, they steered a fair 
course.
Their booth was quite noticeable, 
the trellis work being prettily deco­
rated with foliage, flowers and ban­
ners, a table center piece of carna­
tions, giving the finishing touch to a 
real “cozy corner.”
The thanks of those who attended 
are due to Mr. McMichaels for the 
zeal he put into his preparations. 
Those who enjoyed being there will 
best thank him, however, by letting 
others of the Night Science School 
know of the pleasure that is assured 
in attending this function ,so that 
even a larger turnout may be looked 
for next year.
The Smoke of the Active!
There’s one fashion that never changes—the re­
freshing, wholesome, youthful, spirited fashion of 
“rolling your own” for a lively smoke with good old 
“Bull” Durham.
In no other way can you get a cigarette so fresh and fra­
grant, so full of vigor, energy and action. The man who “rolls 
his own” with “Bull” Durham has the taste of a connoisseur.
GENUINEWiOIll KINWsÍ
SMOKING TOBACCO
The wonderful mildness of “Bull” Durham sets it apart 
from all other tobaccos, and its unique mellow-sweet 
flavor gives distinctive enjoyment to a cigarette.
“Bull” Durham is made of “bright” Virginia-North 
Carolina leaf—the choicest that grows. It is smooth, 
rich, most satisfying — and mild.
Start “rolling your own” with 
“Bull” Durham now, and you’ 
put yourself on the one right road 
to genuine smoking satisfaction.
Ask for FREE package of “papers” with each Se sack.

The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
“Tux” is made of the finest selected Burley— 
full of gimp and go and get-there liveliness.
But it’s a smooth, mellow, fragrant smoke— 
the “Tuxedo Process,” which is often imitated 
but never equalled, takes away all the bite and 
parch and leaves it mild, sweet and cool.
Try one tin of “Tux” — 
you’ll find it will comfort, 
refresh and satisfy you as no 
other tobacco can.

SCIENCE SCHOOL NEWS
SENIORS HARD AT WORK.
The Senior Electricals are now in 
the midst of a sea of wrork. A good 
deal of headway is being made on the 
competitive problem for this year. 
Many of the men are sure that if 
any New York manufacturer could 
see the plans drawn up, there would 
be no doubt whatever that New York 
City would see some new plants 
erected.
The Senior Mechanicals here also 
started on a competitive problem. This 
is a design of a flanging press. The 
problem is such that some very origi­
nal and beautiful designs will be 
evolved.
SENIORS TAKE TRIP TO WASH­
INGTON.
The Senior Electricals had an in­
teresting trip to the Westinghouse 
Electric Co. last week. The trip was 
taken in order to see the modern 
methods in transformer design. After 
a trip through the transformer de­
partment, a very interesting talk was 
given to the party by Mr. Reed’s 
transformer engineer for the com­
pany, on modern tendencies in trans­
former development. The trip was 
enjoyed by all.
TECH HOST AT INDOOR MEET
Continued from Page 1 
mile run.
Special events are as follows: One
mile college relay, one mile handicap 
run, 50-yard handicap dash, half-mile 
factory relay, quarter-mile run for 
high and prep schools, and a tug-of- 
war for five-men teams.
For the championship events, reg­
ular M. A. A. die medals of gold, sil­
ver, and bronze will be awarded. Spe­
cial prizes will be given in the other 
events.
Tech’s track team has settled down 
to hard practice, using the board 
track every evening. It is not certain 
as yet just how large a team will be 
entered, as several of the men are in 
poor condition. Any new material 
should report to Coach Dull, as there 
is excellent opportunity for new can­
didates at the present time.
TECH LOSES TO PITT IN 
HOCKEY.
Game Close—Shooting Poor.
The Pitt hoodoo seems to be bob­
bing up in every sport, even one in 
which Pitt has an acknowledged poor 
team. Although very hopeful of a vic­
tory before the game, our hockey 
seven went down to defeat to the 
score of 1-0 at Duquesne Garden last 
Thursday night.
The game was marked by poor 
shooting on both sides, Pitt having 
the poorer average because they se­
cured about a dozen cracks at our 
goal, of which Anderson caged one 
near the end of the game. Tech only 
bothered Pitt’s goal tender seriously 
four times during the game. Pitt had 
the puck in our territory the majority 
of the time.
However, in getting away and in 
stopping Pitt’s rushes, our men had
a shade on their heavier opponents. 
Julien, Edens and Davis pla/ed our 
hardest game, while Hockensmith and 
Anderson starred for Pitt.
The league directors are to meet this
week to arrangefor theschedule for
the next round and to decide practise
dates as anotherroundrobin will be
played.

VARSITY LOSES OUT ON EAST­
ERN TRIP.
Lose to Cornell, Colgate and Buffalo.
Still pursued by the jinx that kept 
Captain Hines, the stronghold of the 
five, in bed with the grippe at this 
most important season, and kept 
Coach Nichols from fostering his pro­
teges on the trip, the “five” lost each 
of the games. Meredith was no soon­
er out of the city than he was at­
tacked by the foreign army of “Bron­
chitis” and much disabled. Outside 
of these few difficulties the team was 
in excellent condition to meet some 
of the biggest schools of the East on 
their own floors. A game fight was 
made on each occasion, however, and 
never were the opponents in doubt as 
to the fact that they were playing a 
basketball game and not Kelly pool.
Finley Has Best Record.
Finlay starred on the trip and has 
the best record for guarding his man 
and registering scores. Acting Cap­
tain Tumpane was very unfortunately 
off on his previous good shooting and 
couldn’t seem to find the basket as 
he has been able to do with ease 
before. Green played well and showed 
lots of activity.
Team Treated Well.
In each case was the team treated 
with consideration and cordiality by 
their opponents, who made efforts to 
have their stay in their respective 
cities or villages as pleasant as pos­
sible in every way. At Colgate the 
mid-winter Carnival was in session 
and the team was very kindly invited 
to the Musical Clubs and the Dramatic 
Club performances and found them 
on each occasion most enjoyable and 
well executed.
Colgate Spirit.
The spirit at Colgate with which the 
team had more opportunity to be con­
cerned is well worth noting. Every­
thing was done to make it easier for 
the visitors even to the point of car­
rying their suitcases from the station 
and granting every reasonable request. 
At the game they furnished the serv­
ices of several of the students who 
kindly helped the fellows in every 
way—sponging the face at intervals 
with refreshing cold water and helping 
with the clothes and properties. This 
was done in such a spontaneous man­
ner and the whole student body was 
50 Qordial that this event will long be
remembered by those who took part 
in it.
(Editor’s Note ;—Owing to absence 
of the basketball manager, scores and 
line-ups are unobtainable.)
