MANY EVENTS MARK CLOSE OF SCHOOL; 
WAR PAGEANT THRILLS BIG AUDIENCE
Regiment Receives Colors 
On Registration 
Day
RED CROSS TABLEAU
Registration Day was greeted pa­
triotically at Tech by the presenta­
tion of a Red Cross Tableau and 
Regimental Review in the afternoon, 
The program for the afternoon was 
as follows:
.2.00—All classes dismissed.
'.2:10—First call to assembly.
.2:30—Assembly of regiment.
^3:00—Red Cross Tableau by M. M. 
C. S. girls on Design School 
Lawn. Tech regiment stands 
at attention.
-4:00—Regimental Drill and Review 
at Drill Grounds.
'4:30—Presentation of colors by Mrs. 
A. A. Hammedschlag.
The tableau as given by the Red 
•Cross girls was without a doubt a 
most significant interpretation of 
their work. The spirit shown by the 
^girls in their presentation showed 
their full realization of this part of 
the service. They deserve much 
praise for their worthy efforts.
The regimental review was also 
•an impressive feature of the after­
noon. The progress made by the 
'Tech army, since its .organization 
only a few weeks ago, was indeed a 
•surprise for many. The boys showed 
In their drill that they have gained 
much knowledge of military tactics. 
'The manual of arms was given by 
only four companies since equipment 
for the entire regiment was not 
available. The boys handled the 
guns exceedingly well considering 
the limited time that they have had 
them in their possession.
Following the review companies 
•C and D marched in battalion front 
to a point near the top of Flag Staff 
hill. While the whole regiment re­
mained at attention. Mrs. Arthur A. 
I-Iammerschlag presented the colors 
to the color company. The Tune of 
;‘The Call to the Colors,” as p'Cayed 
"by the Tech band gave a true mili­
tary atmosphere to the affair.
All members who had uniforms 
were invited to attend and take 
part in the war pageant of the even­
ing.
COMMENCEMENT DANCE 
TO BE OELD IN DESIGN
Ball is Planned for the Eve of 
Annual Commencement
Contrary to custom and general 
^expectation the date of the com­
mencement Ball was set for Thurs­
day, June 14. This is something of 
a departure from the usual custom 
of holding the final dance on the 
night of the commencement.
The graduates, under graduates, 
faculty, alumni and friends of the 
institution are invited to attend the 
dance which is to be informal, and 
will be held in the foyer of the 
School of Applied Design. Tickets 
are one dollar.
DECORATION DAY GAME 
GOES TO PITT NINE
Warrick Pitches a Brilliant 
Game After Reliev­
ing Hird
Events followed their usual trend 
Decoration Day and the Pitt base­
ball nine won the annual game on 
Tech field by a score of 6- to 2. The 
Pitt team played the best ball and 
wielded their bats to the best advan­
tage. The bright spot in the game 
for the Plaid was the dandy work 
of Warrick on the mound after he 
had relieved pitcher Hird in the 
third inning. A man on third, an­
other on second and none out was 
the situation that faced him. The 
first man grounded to Shorty Miller 
at second, for what should have been 
an easy out, but Shorty booted it 
long enough for the runner to reach 
first. The next three men were 
easy outs. After that Pitt was never 
dangerous, except in the seventh 
when Carlson reached first on an

LOSES TO W. & J. NINE
Bad Playing in Fifth Mars 
Came for Tech
SCORE FIVE TO THREE
Saturday, May 2G, Tech succeeded in 
dropping another game, this time to 
W. & J. at Washington, to the tune of
5 to 3. One bad inning, coupled with 
the lack of ability to wield the 
stick at important times, was the 
inevitable cause.
At the beginning of the fourth in­
ning W. & J. had not scored while 
Tech had annexed two points. Stew­
art and McCreight of Washington 
each succeeded in finding Osborne’s 
curve for two two-baggers, giving W.
6 J. one run.
In the fifth the merry-go-round
started whirling, much to Tech’s dis­
comfiture and when the clouds rolled

In spite of Hie rain, yesterday s program was concluded by 
the Patriotic Pageant presented on the Athletic Field at S :30 last: 
evening. A rather large audience’ witnessed Mr. Tliomas Wood 
Steven's production as it was given for the first time by the stu­
dents of tlie Drama Department under the supervision of Mr. B. 
Iden Payne of New \ ork. The cast, included about a hundred 
performers, in addition to a chorus of Margaret Morrison girls, 
the Design School Symphony Orchestra, J. Vick O'Brien directing, 
and the uniformed members of the. Tech Regiment who answered 
Columbia’s call.
As was announced last week the pageant was originally plan­
ned for yesterday afternoon, but, the affair outgrew original plans 
and was transferred to the evening. The latter time allowed the 
use of more spectacular effects particularly in the use of artificial 
light from, great searchlights upon the Margaret Morrison School 
and in the use of orchestral music. In addition the evening was 
more suitable for the entertainment of the large audience which 
attended.
The general theme of the pageant traces the great war from 
the entrance of Servm to the entrance of the I'nitcd States. The
action takes place in a high court*—---------------------------------------------------

OFFEOED SCHOLARSHIPS
The 1915 graduating class of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
is offering a ?53 scholarship to next 
year's seniors of the same school. 
The recipient will be chosen in re­
gard to her worthiness and financial 
needs, scholastic standing being a 
secondary consideration. If this 
financial aid is a success, the award­
ers will continue each year.

by Austria after the assassination at

black eagles of Germany.

It luis beeii decided that no change 
will be made, at least for the time 
being, in the duration of the present 
school year at Tech. A four-part 
year was considered, and it was also 
proposed that special instruction in 
some subjects should be offered dur­
ing the summer months, but neither 
of these plans were deemed practi­
cal.
The matter is by no means finally 
settled, however; and should the 
government wish it, Carnegie Tech 
may at. any time recosider these 
ideas, or any others proposed. A
committee has been appointed in
each school to investigate the need 
for extra instruction in their re­
spective departments, and no further 
action will be taken except upon
their recommendation.

CANNOTGsARANT-- SsPPORT
The department of Music, School 
of Applied Design, gave its initial 
Symphony Orchestra concert, in 
Carnegie Music Hall, before a large 
and appreciative audience, on Fri­
day evening, June 1, Mr. J. Vick 
O’Brien, conducting.
The program, an ambitious one for 
the first undertaking of a student 
orchestra, reflected credit on the 
work of the department as a whole, 
and the surprise was, thè tact with 
which the performance was handled 
by the conductor and soloists. A 
first performance of any nature is 
nerve-racking enough—but to con­
duct a first public performance of a 
student orchestra is equal to leading 
a charge against artillery fire—the 
outcome is about as certain.
The first part of the program was 
opened with Bach’s “Brandenburg i 
Concerto‘ No. 3”—by the string en­
semble, Mr. Karl A. Malclierek, con­
ducting and was one of the really 
delightful numbers of the evening. I 
This ensemble is especially happy j 
in its interpretation of Bach jnusic— 
having that sureness of attack, clear , 
tone and the fine,sense of rhythm—| 
without which this master’s music 
becomes hopeless. In short, to play 
Bach well means to think and not to 
dream.

At the meeting of the Education 
Section of the Advisory Commission 
of the National Defense Council on 
May 2G, definite answers were ob­
tained from the War Department as 
to military training in colleges, as 
follows:
The Department will maintain for 
the present the existing military 
training in colleges, already estab­
lished under General Orders No. 49, 
but with no guarantee as to how 
long officers and equipment may re­
main available. It plans to continue 
the use of central officers' training 
camps like the three month camps 
now in operation. It may later es­
tablish additional reserve officers’ 
training corps units in colleges, but 
arrangements cannot be made at the 
present time. The Department will 
not in the near future detail officers 
of the army for Instruction in the col­
leges, nor commission and detail men 
competent for the work of Instruc­
tion but ineligible for active. The 
Department Is not at the present 
time able to furnish or promise uni-, 
forms purchased by them. It will 
not provide for military instruction 
in colleges having less than one 
hundred physically able male stu­
dents enrolled for it. The depart­
ment cannot give assurance that

With the au revoir Ball held In 
the Carnegie Union, Friday, May 2fS, 
the middle class of the, school of 
Applied Industries established a pre­
cedent: heretofore unpractical at
Tech. The dance was given In hon­
or of the Upper Mon of the pant 
year, and Is truly worthy of becom­
ing a custom each succeeding year, 
not merely for the school of Applied 
Industries but for all four schools.
Considered from every aspect the 
affair was a huge success from start 
to finale. The walls of the Union, 
draped artistically with countless 
banners presented a scene of pa­
triotic splendor not easily forgotten.

NIGHT STUDENTS HAVE 
DRILLsENTIRE SUMMER
According to Professor Leeds of 
the Industries school, who Is super­
vising the military training of the 
Tech night students, the Night men 
have completed plans for continu­
ing the drill after the close of the 
school year. Undoubtedly there are 
many day students that would like 
to continue the drill in conjunction 
wtili the night men. These should 
communicate with Mr. W. H. Ben- 
net, 5th year Night Science, who has 
succeeded Lieut. Skinkle as adju­
tant.
Professor Leeds expressed satis­
faction with the work and spirit of 
the night students that have regis­
tered for drill. One hundred and 
two men have elected the. course, 
and under the able leadership of 
Mr. Heath and Sergeant Burke, are 
now drilling in company formation.

FINAL ISSUE OF THE TARTAN
The present issue of The Tartan is the final one for this school 
year. The accomplishments of this year’s staff have already been 
reviewed in these columns. As for the new staff, it has done little 
since its installation beyond trying to develop men who will be 
able to fill the positions on the staff creditably next year. How 
well we may succeed remains for the future to decide; certainly 
the task before any new staff is great enough without having to 
deal, as we do, with the varying sentiments of war time.
The success of a paper depends as much upon its readers as 
upon the staff. For many weary weeks we have carried in the 
mast head the following invitation, “The Tartan welcomes all com­
munications of student interest, if signed, the signature to bo with­
held if desired.” Never to the knowledge of the present staff has 
anyone ever taken advantage of that opportunity, aside from the 
letters received in the Cornell Trip Competition. Surely things are 
not so perfect around school that you are satisfied with them. Why 
not express your opinion 1
Do you like the way in which the male students of the De­
sign School—and indeed men from the other schools going into that 
building—neglect to remove their hats? Do you appreciate the 
custom which permits the men to talk to the girls in tho corridors 
of 1hat school even though tho men have their hats pulled firmly 
down over their ears! Wo do not. \ If you agree with us, why not 
take action on tho matter, you who aro tho newly elected officers 
of tho Design School?
Do you like tho way in which some six or eight students of the 
Science School eat, sleep, and study, in fact habitually live at the 
card table of tho Science Club Room? There aro fow peoplo who 
arc actually opposed to a gamo of cards, but tho way in which 
home of the follows get the habit suggests a fetish as all-powerful 
as that which kept the ancient Vestal Virgins in continuous fanat­
ical service. Don’t bo a card fiend I
Do you like tho way in which tho storeroom is run, with par­
ticular reference to tho ono in tho Industries School? Wo do not. 
It needs no particular gift of prophecy to foretell that at tho be­
ginning of next year tho students will bo rushed for books, that 
they will standi in lino for half an hour or more before being 
served, and that they will then often bo disappointed. It needs 
no high priced efficiency export to say that ft larger force, longer 
hours, and a more convenient method of handling customers would 
be appreciated at tho beginning of tho year, and that wo could 
enjoy greater promptness and more suitable hours oven now.
Probably you have noticcd these very things and many others 
besides. Why not write and tell us about them? You know 
there actually is a time when “every knock is a boost,” for crit­
icism leads the way to correction.
CO-OPERATION
Preparations for the production of Professor Stevens’ War 
Pageant—aside from material value to which those preparations 
will give rise—show to Tech how fortunate she is in the possession 
of a. spirit of co-operation. The burden of the work, it is true, 
falls upon the students of the Drama Department. Theirs are the 
speaking parts. The other Design Students, however, are aiding 
' by giving their services as the hundred or more silent actors in 
the groups of the nations. The Symphony Orchestra provides the 
musical part of the performance, along with the chorus of girls 
' from the Margaret Morrison School. Tho Tech Regiment., com­
posed of men from all three schools, takes an active part in the 
action of the pageant by responding to the call of Columbia. Even 
! ¡hose, who are not actually in the play are planning to help by 
their attendance.
Pittsburghers often comment upon the wonderfully large au- 
• dience which Tech is always ablo to get at any of her affairs. That 
is duo to two things. First, tho students themselves attend and 
they spread tho news so enthusiastically that all their friends 
^re inflnoncod to come. Even that however would be of no avail 
if. it were not for the second reason; namely, that Tech students 
co-operate so well and work so successfully that their audiences 
are certain to see something worth while.

FORMER FOOTBALL STAR 
WEDS SWISSVALE GIRL
“Pop” Fletcher, one of the stars 
of our famous 1916 football team 
scored a touchdown and kicked goal 
all himself when he gained a wif^.., . ¦
in Philadelphia on Tuesday, May 
28th.
Fletcher, an old navy man, re­
enlisted several weeks ago and was 
immediately sent to Philadelphia, 
leaving behind one of two hearts 
that beat as one. These two hearts 
evidently decided that they could 
beat more in unison if they were 
united by the bonds of matrimony. 
Accordingly the young lady in the 
case . journeyed to Philadelphia and 
they were married on the above men­
tioned date in the Bellevue Strat­
ford Hotel.
The bride, formerly Miss Ruth 
Alberta Gailey, is the daughter of 
Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Gailey of Regent 
Square, Swissvale.
INITIAL CONCERT GIVEN
BY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA
(Continued From Page One.
The orchestra was at its best in 
the Chopin number—“Piano Con­
certo No. 2 in F minor”—with Miss 
Helen Eshelmen at thè piano. It 
gave her just the right support, at 
no time obtruding itself on the solo­
ist. The composition is simple and 
direct in its appeal, and has at the 
same time the beauty characteristic 
of this composer and was well within 
the grasp of both the soloist and the 
orchestra. Miss Eshelman played 
with a sureness and ease that was 
indicative of her proficiency as a 
pianist. The number elicited most 
cordial applause.
Mr. Horace I. Brown is to be con­
gratulated on his artistic perform­
ance of Saint Saens’ very difficult 
“Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, 
Op. 28”—for violin and orchestra. 
Mr. Brown’s playing is always char­
acterized by clear tone, sureness and 
a firm intellectual grasp of the com­
poser’s musical content..- The ap­
plause received at the conclusion of 
the number, spoke loudly of the 
pleasure of the audience in the per­
formance.
The second half of the program 
presented Haydn’s “Surprise Sym­
phony” in G minor. In the second 
movement “Andante,” the orchestra 
did some of its most artistic work, 
the ensemble being noticeably good, 
with a fine discrimination through­
out in regard to nuance. The entire 
number received hearty applause. t
The “Organ Concerto No. 1, Op. 
42,” by Guilmant, played by Mr. 
Anthony Jawelak, a blind student, ex"- 
cited much sympathetic interest on 
the part of the audience. Long and 
vociferous applause with recalls dem­
onstrated the success of the per­
former and the appreciation of the 
achievement.
Mr. George Curry gave a very in­
teresting interpretation, of Godard's 
Sur le lac, Op. 36”—for ’cello, with 
orchestral accompaniment. This in­
strument is a favorite with the con­
cert going public and the number 
was well received.
The heaviest number on the pro­
gram was the final, Tschaikowsky’s 
“March Slav,” Op. 31—for orchestra, 
which demanded all the resources 
of the orchestra and was given with 
considerable dash and style. The 
performance elicited rounds of ap­
plause.
The entire program was interesting 
as a. demonstration of the achieve­
ments of this department and as an 
indication of the place this school is 
destined to occupy in the field of art 
which it represents.

TRAINING FOR COLLEGES
(Continued From Page One.) 
the military training given under the 
auspices of the colleges will be 
formally recognized, though it is 
evident that such training will give 
an advantage to those who have re­
ceived it when they are called out 
in the selective draft, by qualifying 
them for rapid promotion.
It seems clear that the War De­
partment will not in any case pro­
vide military training in the col­
leges in time for the next semester, 
if at all. Colleges are thus left to 
make their own arrangements at 
their own expense.
It also seems clear that the de­
partments at Washington have not 
yet begun to consider seriously the 
importance and the critical needs at 
the present time of our system cf 
higher education. English and Can­
adian authorities now understand 
this problem far more fully. Ar­
rangements have been made by Dr. 
Godfrey for a joint session early in 
July of our section with a strong 
representative committee already ap­
pointed by the Canadian universities 
and probably also with representa­
tives of the English universities; the 
joint committee to hold a conference 
with the Council of National De­
fense. The Canadian Government 
and Mr. Balfour have expressed their 
deep interest in this matter and their 
hearty desire to cooperate with us 
in tho solution of the problem.
The Education Section will send 
out soon to all colleges recommend­
ations adopted with reference to 
equipping young women in our col­
leges and universities for war time 
service. It lias arranged to refer 
offers of personal services to the 
Intercollegiate Intelligence Bureau, 
Munsey Building, Washington, D. C. 
It has requested the Bureau of Edu­
cation to issue information as to 
uniform record cards for the filing 
of data on the mobilization of col­
lege men and women for the national 
service.

A short-story reading party was 
given last Thursday in the Recrea­
tion Hall by Mrs. Vermorcken of the 
General Studies department in M. 
M. C. S.
The stories, four in number, had 
been written by senior members of 
Mrs. Vermorcken’s class in short- 
story writing. They were read to 
the audience by Mrs. Vermorcken, 
who did not reveal the author’s 
name but asked that each member 
cast a vote for the best story.
The stories which were read were: 
"The Power of Silence,” “The Icono­
clast,” and “Men and Weddings.” 
Owing to lack of time the last story 
“A Woman's Question,” was only 
partly read. However, it is to be 
hoped that it. will be finished at 
some future time as the perplexing 
problems of the heroine were still 
unsolved.
Having followed to a happy, but 
rather conventional close, the for­
tunes of a tired author seeking 
quiet and rest in a country-house in­
habited by deaf mutes, reader and 
listeners regaled themselves with 
punch and wafers.
The second story, “Men and Wed­
dings,” was at once amusing and 
pathetic in its picture of the irrita­
tion and resentment felt by the over­
worked head of a family at the ap­
parent neglect by his wife and 
daughter who are busily preparing 
for a wedding. This story showed 
great ability in portraying human na­
ture, but lacked symmetry in con­
struction.
Of the three stories “The Icono­
clasts,” proved to be the most pleas­
ing because of its element of the 
mysterious and supernatural, and the 
surprise of its ending.
The object of the theater is to-- 
teach us, not what this or that par­
ticular person has done, but what 
every person under certain circum­
stances would do.—Lessing. -

SCIENCE FACULTY VOTE 
ON RE-EXAM QUESTION
At a recent meeting of the Science 
faculty the following plan was 
adopted.
“Voted, that in the case of re­
examinations, the grade ‘reported for 
such re-examination will be the final 
rating.” This rating will take effect 
for all students at the re-examina- 
tion period, September, 1917, and for 
all first semester re-examinations 
held the week following commence­
ment Day, 1917.
This action was taken because 
a great many students have made a 
practice in the past ,jof taking re­
examinations without -any especial 
preparation for them. If a student 
had not three-quarters credit ratings 
in his year’s work, and wished to 
raise a “P” to a “C,” for example, 
it was usually the custom to choose 
a. subject in which he believed the 
re-examination would be easy, and 
trust to luck to “get by” in it, as 
he had nothing to lose. As it is 
now, no one will take a re-examina­
tion without special preparation, be­
cause a grade of “P” on that exam­
ination will mean that he will have 
to repeat the subject in question. The 
previous rating of “P” will not be 
considered.
This fact will no. doubt make a 
number think more seriously before 
taking a re-examination, and will 
thus save the instructors much extra 
work in conducting them and cor­
recting papers; and this is just 
what the ruling aims to do.

ALL COLLEGES OF COUNTRY GIVELOYAL SUPPORT IN MANY LINES
WORCESTER TECH.
At a resent meeting of the faculty, 
a report wall made by the committee 
which was appointed to consider the 
action that the Institute should take 
regarding Tech men and the war. 
The governing feature of this report 
was the recommendation that the 
members of the three lower classes 
should continue with their courses at 
the Institute.
This committee his given the mat­
ter very careful and deliberate study 
and their decision is based on the 
action of the other colleges of New 
England and upon the particular sit­
uation here at Worcester Tech. The 
fact was taken into consideration 
that this is a technical institution 
and not a liberal arts college, and 
that the courses which- are offered 
equip men for most efficient practi­
cal service in the industrial world. 
As the success of this war depends 
as much on the industrial ability of 
the country as upon the number of 
men on the battle field, the young 
engineer is rendering his country a 
great service by increasing his 
knowledge of his profession, in order 
that he may be of greater value in 
the industrial army.
Basing their judgment 011 these and 
other similar considerations, the com­
mittee recommended the following 
five rules:
First: that the regular schedule 
a£ class work, examinations, gradu­
ation, and summer courses for the 
rest of the present year remain un­
changed.
Second: that seniors in good stand­
ing, who are candidates for a de­
gree, should receive the same at 
time of graduation, although, they 
should be called. at once for service 
in the army or navy.
Third: that the President shall
have power to grant this same privi­
lege to any senior who enters the 
industrial field of national defense, 
in consultation with the head of the 
department.'
Fourth: that any lower classman 
may be excused from the work at 
the Institute for the remainder of 
the school year if lie wishes to en­
list in the army or navy, or to go 
into training for the same, or if he 
wishes to go into any industrial or 
agricultural field. Such persons will 
be given special opportunity to make 
up the work thus lost, and to enter 
the next class at the beginning of 
the next semester.
Fifth: that, in compliance with the 
request of the Committee on Public 
Safety and in conformity with the 
resolutions of the Massachusetts 
College Presidents, the Institute will 
accept, on trial, candidates for ad­
mission to the Freshman Class, next 
September, who bring a statement 
from their high school principal that 
they would have been entitled to 
full certification but for their having 
been released for definite industrial 
or .agricultural tasks with evidence 
that they have given continuous and 
satisfactory service in that employ­
ment.
l available, for many had to leave with- 
] out being able to formally notify their 
! deans of their departure. It is esti- 
I mated that slightly over one hundred 
! students are now in the various camps, 
• out of the ISO-odd who applied.
; At a mass meeting held on Saturday 
j night, announcement, was made that 
i Pen» State men within twenty-four 
hours'after receiving a request for one 
j unit of thirty-six men for ambulance 
j work in France, had responded with a 
I total of seventy-five applicants, 01 
| enough men to make up two units, 
j The call came from the Surgeon Gen­
eral’s office of the War Department 
through the Intercollegiate Intelli­
gence Bureau, of which Dean Pond is 
chairman of the Penn State branch. 
A telegranrwas at once sent that Penn 
State would gladly send one unit, and 
asking if two would be accepted. No 
word has ben received' as yet. as to 
further procedure in the matter here 
The unit will be selected by the Penn 
State branch of the bureau, and the 
choice will be based on scholastic 
standing, physical condition and ex­
perience with' automobile driving.
A total of 1,400 men will be sent out 
in this work as soon as they can be 
organized and equipped. In all proba 
bility this will be the first American 
group to reach France. Service will 
be for the duration of the war. The 
personnel of each unit will be made 
up of one sergeant, two corporals, one 
chief mechanic, two mechanics, two 
cooks, two clerks, two orderlies and 
twenty-four drivers.
The colleges which supply the en­
tire personnel of one or more units 
can count on having these units kept 
together and officers chosen from 
among their men, granting that some­
one can be found who has had suffi­
cient executive and military training 
to justify being appointed as sergeant. 
In any case, the corporals will be 
chosen from the group. “Dutch” Her 
man, football and basketball coach, 
has volunteered his services and is 
spoken favorably of as the leader of 
the first Penn State unit.
Announcement has been made that 
all members of the faculty who are 
called away for government or mili­
tary service will have their positions 
held open.
PENN.
Latest dispatches from the "front” 
—Fort Niagara and Madison Barracks 
—where more than one hundred Penn 
State undergraduates are starting off 
on a hard three-months’ grind in 
preparation as officers in the United 
States Army, indicate that they are 
comfortably settled, but not too much 
inclined to tell of the events of the 
long day’s work that they are com­
pelled to start at 5:20 each morning.
No definite word has been received 
as yet with regard to the placement 
of the Penn State men at the camps. 
But it is thought that the two years’ 
of military drill which most of the men 
have had here, will stand them in 
good stead in their assignment to du­
ties in the camps.
Word was received by Cautain Ah­
rends yesterday that Clyde A. Fowler, 
’18, a lieutenant in the college cade' 
regiment, had been honored with the 
appointment as first sergeant with one 
of the companies. This is considered 
to be a very high honor at the camps 
and should result in further promotion 
for this Penn State man. He was 
highly recommended as to military 
ability, and in addition to his experi­
ence here, he made a very creditable 
showing at the Plattsburgh camp last 
year.
A complete list of the Penn State 
men who have been successful in gain­
ing admission to the camps is not yet

The University of Wisconsin will 
send 140 seniors and juniors to the 
Fort Sheridan, 111., Officers’ Train­
ing Camp. About 95 per cent, of 
these men have had two or more 
years’ military training. The cadet 
corps now numbers about 1,200, of 
whom about 600 should be available 
for commissions within the year. 
Major C. F. Crain, Thirty-seventh 
United States Infantry, referring to 
the Wisconsin men who will go .to 
Fort Sheridan, says that after thi*ae 
months' intensive field training, such 
as they will get, they should make 
splendid officers who will very near 
measure up to the regular army 
standard. The university, he adds, 
can now turn out 600 officers each 
year.

June 28 pay $9 through the agency where the application 
was filed.
July f.30 pay $10. August 15 pay $15. August 30 pay $15.
When the second payment is made an official certificate will

government, is approximately 300. 
and practically all of these men are 
available with the proper physical 
qualifications as officers in the army.
“At the present time; approximate­
ly 1,500 men are engaged in military 
work here, and about six or seven 
hundred of these could be available 
as officers during the next year.
“You understand, of course, that 
these men are pursuing this military 
work voluntarily and, while the uni­
versity gives scholastic credit for it, 
it is not. a compulsory part of the 
curriculum.
“Regarding the personality of the 
seniors, I should say* that in general 
they are the class of men from whom 
the best officers for a national army 
can be made. Their intellectual 
training has been such that with 
proper military training they will 
make very efficient officers.”

“The Cornell curriculum pro­
vides,” writes H. H. Hitchcock, Sec­
retary of the University, “for uni­
versal military training only during

elective. At present there are over 
1,600 men drilling in these two class­
es, and in addition there is the eight- 
hour drill- each day, which includes 
juniors and seniors, the Officers’ Re­
serve Corps unit, the Ambulance 
Corps, the Engineering Corps, the 
Wireless Corps, etc. We suppose 
there are at least 2,000 men drilling 
on the university campus.
“It would be difficult to determine 
just how many of these men are 
available for commissions on account 
of the age limit and also the physical 
availability of the men. I should 
think that we might estimate that 
at least 1,000 of these men would 
pass the physical and age tests, but 
any answer that we make would be 
approximate.”
HARVARD. UNIVERSITY.
The Harvard University Officers 
Training Corps numbers about 1,200 
men, under command of Captain 
Constant Cordier, U. S. A. Army in­
spectors report that this corps is 
among the finest in the country and 
that a. majority of the members will 
make splendid officers. Five officers 
of the French Army are now assist­
ing Captain Cordier in the training 
of the Harvard Corps.
PURDUE UNIVERSITY.
The cadet corps of the Purdue 
University, at Lafayette, Ind., is one 
of the finest in the West. More 
than 300 Purdue men are expected to 
attend the officers’ training camps 
this summer. At least, as many 
more, it is stated, will bo available 
for the Federal service before the 
end of the year. There are more 
than 1,000 cadets in the Purdue 
corps.
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME.
The president of the University of 
Notre Dame, Ind., writes:
“In reply to your inquiry, I deslro 
to say that ninety members of the 
senior class at Notre Dame are 
cadets, and that all of those young 
men are available for officers In 
the army.
“At; least one-fourth of the num­
ber of cadets in our battalion, apart 
from the seniors, would bo ready for 
commissions within a year.
“As compared with men who have 
received a prolongod and sovoro 
military training in such a school as 
West Point, the students of Noti;o 
Dame would be' handicapped for a 
time. Some of them would bo ns 
efficient as oven any of the young 
men from West Point, and many 
others would make up whatever mili­
tary knowledge? or experience would 
be lacking. I do not believe It would 
be possible to improve on the morale 
of the Notre Dame men If they were 
to be appointed officers in the army.”

The program consisted of twenty 
dances exclusive of four extras. The 
fourth number was easily the fea­
ture of the evening. The music be­
gan with the soft dreamy strains of 
a waltz when suddenly every light in 
the hall was extinguished. While 
the tension was at the highest the 
report of a gun was heard and a 
single ray of light played upon a 
flag fluttering over the dancers' 
heads, while the orchestra in one 
grand blaze of glory struck up that 
memorable yet ever popular march 
“Stars and Stripes Forever,” The 
music was furnished by McCloud’s

With Hli’d the story was alto­
gether different. Jimmy Dehart 
smashed his first pitch on 'a dead 
lino to Cliff and pulled up at second. 
Geisel walked and McClelland and 
Hastings smacked out clean hits in 
rapid succession, scoring Dehart and 
Geisel, McClelland scored on Sies’rf 
out.
Hammer was going well on the 
mound for Pitt up until the seventh, 
chiefly because the Skibo sluggers 
were hitting the ball directly at Pitt 
inflelders. With one down in the
seventh, Captain ZchfusB looked 
them over and strolled to first nft 
Cosgrove had gone out, Gano, doubled 
clear to the board walk in left cen­
ter, scoring Zehfuss. Pitchor War­
rick tried l.o win Ills own game. I-fls 
two bagger c,Inured Geisel's head

Gano registered Tech's second run.
The game had several fielding 
features to which Dehart contributed 
l ho most. In I ho third, Jim leapt 
Into the air and speared a steaming

so quick that II. looked more like

Hut two more games are loft on 
the baseball schedule. One with the 
alumni team to I lie played either 
June 7 or June i). The final game 
of the season is with Lehigh -Uni­
versity to be held here, Monday, 
June 11. Warrick, who has not 
pitched before because of his studies, 
will probably pitch for the Plaid 
nine.
So far the. team has won but two 
games and lost nine. Three games 
have been cancelled because of the 
war, Virginia Polytechnic Institute 
and the Michigan Agricultural Col­
lege teams having disbanded, while 
Western Reserve University was 
unable to play because of rain. The 
schedule one of the best that Tech 
ever completed was due to the hard 
work of Manager Jack Kennedy. 
With a little better pitching, Ken­
nedy w'ould have been the manager 
of the best baseball team in years.

QUARTERMASTER’S CORPS 
NEEDS MEN URGENTLY
Division Should be Recruited 
Before Conscription 
Begins
Thoro I», of course, urgent need 
for men in all branches of national 
service, but the following communi­
cation shows that the need is par­
ticularly great in the Quartermas­
ter’s Division. It 1L doubtful if Car­
negie Institute of Technology can 
supply men with the necessary quali­
fications, but the letter is published 
in the hope that there may be some 
few to whom the offer will appeal. 
“Carnegie Institute or Technology, - 
“Pittsburgh, Penna.
“Gentlemen:
“In connection with the work of 
the Quartermaster’s Department, I 
am enclosing communication from 
the Philadelphia Committee, which 
has charge of the country in whifch 
your institution is located, as re­
gards enlistment in the Quarter­
master’s Reserve Corps, United 
Stales Army.
“I will greatly appreciate il. if you 
will have this communication pub­
lished several times in your col­
lege paper, whether it is a daily or 
weekly, and also if you will take the 
trouble to request the papers in your 
vicinity to either print if in full or 
make mention of the important points 
in connection with it.
“It is absolutely necessary that 
I he Quartermaster’s Department be 
enlisted to full strength before troops 
go into the various training camps 
at the time conscription goes into 
effect.
“All of this work is being done by 
private citizens, who are giving a 
considerable part of their time each 
day to getting this enlistment under 
way promptly, and your co-operation 
will be greatly appreciated.
“Thanking you very much, I re­
main,
“ Yours very truly,
“\V. N. MORICE.”
Quartermaster’s Enlisted 
Reserve Corps.
“The Philadelphia Section, East­
ern Division, with headquarters at 
the Automobile Club of Philadel­
phia, 23 South Twenty-third .street,
1 has been, authorized to enlist twenty 
(20) Wagon Companies, ten (10)
Motor Truck Companies and two (2) j 
Bakery Companies.
"A Wagon Company consists of l 
Wagon Master with the rank of Ser- 
genat; 3 Assistant Wagon Masters, 
with the rank of Sergeant; 1 Horse 
Slioer, L Blacksmith, 1 Saddler, all 
with ihe rank of Corporals; 1 Cook, 
with I ho pay of a Sergeant; and 2S 
Teamsters, with rank of Private, 
first class.
“A Motor Truck Company con­
sists of 34 Sergeants and 1 Cook.
“A Bakery Company consists of 1 
SCrgeant, first class; 2-1 Sergenats, 
20 Corporals, 2 Cooks and 14 Pri­
vates, first class.
“In addition, thoro are needed va­
rious numbers of Butchers, Clerks, 
Painters, Forage Masters, Farriers, 
Overseers of Labor., Storekeepers, 
Watchmen and Skilled Laborers. The 
qualifications for these positions vary 
and can be obtained upon applica­
tion to the Headquarters above men­
tioned. Many of these positions 
carry (lie rank of Sergeant, first 
class; Sergeant and Corporal1:
“No difficulty is anticipated in 
more than filling up the full quota of 
Truck Drivers, but it will probably 
be difficult to secure the necessary 
Wagon Masters (80) and Teamsters 
(500); the Bakery Companies, total­
ing 122 men and the various spe­
cial postions above mentioned.
“The pay of Sergeant, first class, 
is $45, per month; Sergeants, $36;. 
Cooks, $30; Corporals, $24; Private 
first class, $1S; Privates, $15. In ad­
dition to their regular pay, all en­
listed men receive rations, quar­
ters, clothing, fuel, bedding, medi­
cines and medical attendance when 
required. An increase in all of these 
is being considered and on foreign 
service they are automatically in­
creased.
“Enlistment in the Quartermas­
ter’s Enlisted Reserve Corps now, 
exempts a man from conscription. 
This is an important point right at 
this time. No military training is 
required and there is no drilling 
with rifles, guard duty or other 
purely military duties which fall to 
the lot of soldiers in other branches 
of the service, except in case of 
emergency. In stating these facts, 
it is not done with any idea of sug­
gesting in any way the shirking of 
military responsibility. This depart­
ment is one of the most responsible 
connected with the Army, in fact it 
is vital to the success of an Army. 
The transportation of supplies has 
increased to an almost, unbelievable 
extent and it is absolutely necessary 
that this branch be recruited to full 
strength before our Army goes into 
its various training camps.
"Enlist now! Particularly the 
Wagon Masters, Teamsters and Bak­
ers Write at. once to 23 South 
Twenty-third street, Philadelphia, for 
full information. Tell the young men 
on the farms to enlist.
"Anyone between the ages of IS 
and 45 is qualified. Married men 
are not. barred, but are not wanted 
if their families will be dependent 
for support, after they are called 
out.’’

UNDERGOES OPERATION 
TO SECURE COMMISSION
Word has just leaked out that 
Henry Levy, the former Carnegie 
Tech football and basket ball star, 
is in the Presbyterian Hospital on 
the Nortliside, wiiere he underwent 
an operation last Saturday in an at­
tempt to remedy a physical trouble 
that would have marred his chances 
of rocelving a commission in the 
army.
Levy, who is now employed at the 
Wost.inghouse plant in East Pitts­
burgh. and has boon a member of 
the AVestlnghouso Club basket ball 
team for two seasons, took advan­
tage of his vacation period to have 
the operation performed. He went 
through it in good style and expects 
to be out shortly, after which he 
will go after that, commission.
ALUMNI NOTES.
H. B. Applegate, '15. writes from 
Madras, India, on April 23, that, he 
wishes to be remembered to all his 
Tech friends. . He requests a Regis­
ter of Graduates so that he might 
have the addresses of his classmates.
