COMMITTEE ON 
POINT SYSTEM 
IS ANNOUNCED
Collecting Information on 
Number of Activities in 
Which Each Student is 
Now Engaged
ASK CO-OPERATION
The Point Committee is now busy 
collecting information about the num­
ber of activities engaged in by each 
student. Forms are being presented 
to the secretaries and managers of 
the various activities upon which 
they are expected to place the desired 
information. It is requested that the 
activities co-operate with the Point 
Committee and fill out and return all 
forms promptly.
The following students are hand­
ling the point system in their respec­
tive schools: Anna Klrker, Eleanor
Schoenberg, Margaret Morrison; J. 
V. Foster, A. R. Zelt, Industries; Vin­
cent, Beatty, Fine Arts; P. C. Gam­
mon, Engineering, and W. E. Lange, 
Chairman.
The rules of the point system were 
published in an early edition of the 
Carnegie Tartan. It is realized that 
some activities are receiving more 
than their due share of points and 
others less. Representatives of ac­
tivities'which feel that this is so are 
requested to make their complaint 
known to some member of the com­
mittee and action will be taken to 
remedy them.
SCALP AND BLADE DONATES 
NEW CUP TO WINNERS
IN LEAGUE BASKET BALL
The Scalp and Blade, a very ac­
tive organization of collegemen from 
Buffalo, seeing that the present cup 
is not appropriate for the situation, 
has taken the initiative and offered a 
large silver loving cup to the winners 
of the Inter-Frat-Dorm Basket Ball 
Leagues. This cup is to remain in 
the possession of the winners for one 
year and must be then surrendered 
to the new champions for the next 
season. Any team winning the cup 
three times, not necessarily in succes­
sion, may keep it permanently.
Colonel S. H. Church 
Addresses R. 0. T. C.
Speaks on the Life Value of 
Military Training
Colonel Samuel Harden Church, 
President of the Carnegie Institute, 
spoke before the combined classes of 
the R. 0. T. _C. on Tuesday, March 
14. The subject of his address was 
“The Life Value of Military Train­
ing.”
Colonel Church emphasized the fact 
that drill, discipline and obedience 
which are necessary in the making of 
a good soldier, are applicable to a 
man’s duties in the larger sphere of 
civil life. He said that no man who 
has not learned to obey will ever suc­
ceed in a position where he requires 
the loyalty and obedience of other 
men and that nowhere could that 
ability be better acquired than in a 
school which devotes part of its time 
to military training. He stated also 
that a man who has learned the rudi­
ments of good soldiery will be a bet­
ter citizen and love his country more 
because he then would have the abil­
ity to fight for his country’s defense.
Military training develops in a man 
initiative and individuality, qualities 
for which colleges were’ instituted 
to develop. ‘‘There is great need,” 
Colonel Church said, “in business and 
commercial life as well as in politics, 
for men who have been taught to use 
initiative and develop individuality.”
Carnegie Band Gives 
Concert at Mayview
A Good Program Was, Ren­
dered. Bandmen are Given 
Dance After Concert
To an appreciative and receptive 
audience the Carnegie Tech Band 
gave a concert at Mayview last night. 
The program was made up of classi­
cal, martial and the latest popular 
airs selected so that combined they 
would make up a well balanced'con­
cert.
For those who love and appreci­
ate classical music, selections from 
the Grand Opera "Martha” and the 
Overtures "Simplicity’^ and "Boreas” 
were rendered. And for those who 
like the snap and vim of martial airs 
the Marches “The First Battalion,” 
“Marine Band” and “Student Spirit” 
were played. For those also who like 
the lightness of popular music 
“Kisses,” “Wabash Blues,” “Kalula” 
and “Tuclcy Home” were rendered. 
The whole concert went off without 
a hitch and seemed to be well receiv­
ed. judging from the number of en­
cores called for.
The Mayview Concert has always 
been considered by the Musical Or­
ganizations of Carnegie Tech as a 
sort of a tryout of their program so 
that the degree of success that is at­
tained there is fairly indicative of 
the success they will have at other 
places. "Sully," the director, the man­
agement and tlie bandmen themselves 
are to be complimented for being able 
to produce a concert of such quality.
The band left Pittsburgh at 5:30 
yesterday afternoon and arrived in 
Mayview about 6 o’clock. They were 
entertained about the grounds of the 
institution for a short time when a 
dinner was served to them. The con­
cert lasted for a little more than an 
hour and the rest of the time was 
spont in dancing. Music was furnish­
ed by an orchestra composed of band­
men and it was exceptionally good. 
They arrived back in the city about 
11 o’clock, everyone having had a 
most enjoyable time.

COMMITTEE APPOINTED
TO PLAN UNION OF THE
FOUR JUNIOR CLASSES
On Friday of Inst week the Juniors 
of the four schools mot In the Little 
Theater to discilss the advisability of 
a coalition of the four classes.
A. Stephen Vincent presided and 
called upon the other three presidents 
to give their opinion on the matter. 
All talked decidedly In favor of such 
an organization.
After a general discussion from tho 
floor a motion was passed to form a 
committee of eight to be composed of
Two Prominent Men Talk'«“ I umi »..other mem-I her from each of the four schools, to

While there are some bad points in 
such a plan, it is felt that a closer or­
ganization will inake for better unity 
among the four1; classes.
BEAUX ARTS JUDGMENT
HITS ARCHITECTS HARD
The architects for the first time 
in many years were overcome by 
the judgment of the Beaux Arts In­
stitute of Design of New York. 
Working for five weeks in an at­
tempt to capture the honors, they 
were vanquished by a severe jury 
who dealt out twenty-one zeros.
Even at that Tech was among the 
schools that took a first mention 
placed and two first mentions. Mr. 
Lynch’s design of an "Elevation for 
a ¡City Residence” was highly com­
mended by the jury. His drawing 
received the first mention placed. D. 
sM. Patterson was awarded the first 
mention for his solutipn of the ele­
vation.

Carnegie Tech who received a first

nue Hotel last Saturday evening, 
where the entire electrical depart­
ment of the College of Engineering 
gathered for their annual banquet 
under the auspices of the Carnegie 
Tech Branch of the A. I. E. E.
Every class was represented at the 
affair, several of the Plebes who are 
planning or pursuing a course in the 
electrical department being on hand 
to join in the gathering.
The rapid growth of the local 
branch of the A. I.1 E. E. dining the 
last year was emphasized by the large 
attendance at the banquet and be­
comes an indication of what next 
year will bring forth in the activities 
of the A. I. E. E.
Professor William R. Work, head of 
the Department of Electrical Engi­
neering, acted as toastmaster and in­
troduced the two main speakers of 
the evening, Mr. W. B. Spillmlre of 
the General Electric Company and 
Mr. F. W. Speller of the National 
Tube Works.
Study and the classroom were fur­

of the faculty present, judging from

Mr. Hornbostel will also mako the 
Plans for the building and immediate­
ly a contract will be let out to one 
of the large conatructolon companies

R. 0. T. C. MEN TO 
GET COMMISSIONS
Senior Names Sent 
Washington For 
Approval
to
The R. O. T. C. Department an­
nounces that the names of the Sen­
iors to be given commissions in the 
corps of the »Organized Reserves 
have been sent to Washington. This 
commission is given to those men 
upon whom the 'department feels jus­
tified In placing the responsibility and 
honor of such & commission.
The value of this commission in­
creases with its usefulness and con­
venience. For this reason, as well as 
for the purpose of organization of our 
country’s forces|itlio entire U. S. is 
divided Into a number of divisions. 
Thus, should a man upon Ills gradu­
ation, move to some other part of tho 
country, his position in the Organ­
ized Reserves would not end. 1-Ie 
would merely be’, transferred from the 
division in which he was located to 
his new location.
A man with this commission Is not 
placed at tho immediate disposal of 
the government in time of noed. He 
can bo called to)' service only by tho 
act of Congress, and, due to his ad­
vanced knowledge can accept a com­
mand of Importance. Pittsburgh is lo­
cated in the Slflth Division and Major 
Jewett is in command of tho organ­
ization.

BOSSANGE GIVES TALK
AT SCIENCE ASSEMBLY
Director Bossange of the College 
of Fine Arts, spoke before the En­
gineering students at the Science 
Assembly, March! 15, on the relation 
of the College of Fine Arts to the 
other colleges of Carnegie Tech.
He stressed the fact that, before 
the World War, America imported 
most of its art, but that now we 
are developing our own art and art­
ists. The Art School of Carnegie 
Tech has a hand in this great work 
of giving to America American art
by American artists. The policy of 
mention for the solution of “A Town £jie .Qoiiege of Fine Arts, he said, is 
Hall.” Five men received H. C. s teach art in a manner that will 
for departure from the preliminary develop the individuality of the stu-
sketch.
That the jury was severe is prov­
en by the fact that out of two hun­
dred drawings submitted by the va­
rious schools of the country, one 
hundred and fifty were given zeros.
Chess Club, to Organize Team
The Chess Tournament held under 
the auspices of the Chess Club is 
now more than half over. Quite a 
few games have been played, and all 
contestants are urged to rapidly 
finish their schedules since all games 
must be played by next Wednesday.
The winners of this tournament 
Shall not necessarily constitute the 
chess team, but the skill displayed 
will bt3 the prime factor in choosing 
the men.
As soon as the team is selected, 
Managor Ragsdale expects to arrange 
a match with the Westinghouse Club 
of Wil-kinsburg. He also states that 
variou i Pitt men have expressed 
desire to meet our team. 
h
dent, so that, he will have inculcated 
in him the ability to make others 
see the beauty, love, grace and 
thought underlying all his work. In 
order to accomplish this result, the 
Art School cannot be run on » 
standarlzed time or work schedule.
The day the College of Fine Arts 
becomes a machine, that day it will 
become the worst art school in the 
country. We have here a wonderful 
opportunity to develop our. College 
of Fine Arts into the finest art 
school in the country. What the 
iCollege of Fine Arts needs of the 
other colleges of Carnegie Tech is 
a more sympathetic understanding of 
its work, its aims and its ideals.
In closing Director Bossange stated 
that he and his co-workers were 
very proud of the accomplishments 
of our Engineering College and that 
he hoped to make us leel just as 
proud of the work of our Art School.
the Czecho-SIovak National dance, 
was staged by eight members of the 
club attired in costumes of their 
native land. Elmer A. Stephan sang 
four solos. “HigMand Fling,” "Sail­
or’s Hornpipe” and other dances of 
the British Isles were presented by 
John Blackhall, Samuel Scott and 
Clara Scott. The Schenley High 
School Orchestra opened the pro­
gram.
The committee in charge of ar­
rangements was Susan T. Canfield. J. 
R. Hritz, L. I. Hertzman and J. P.

GRAPHICA CLUB TAKES
IN SOME rtEW MEMBERS
Tho design for tho Senior Fonco 
has just boon completed and Is now 
in tho hands of the Senior Privilege 
Committee. The commltteo will tako 
up the matter of Its construction with 
the administration In tho noar fu­
ture ¦ J. W. Minick, Senior Architect 
and a member of tho (Senior Privileges 
Committee, is the designer of tho 
Fence. It will he vory slmplo In con­
struction, being composed entirety of 
wood and resembling much tho typi­
cal College Senior Fence. Tho top of 
tho Fonco will bo made so that It is 
comfortable to sit upon. A socoiul rail 
will be placed about half way up to 
serve as a foot rest. Shrubbery and 
trees are to bo planted in tho roar 
to furnish tho necessary background. 
In a few years It will undoubtedly bo 
covered with the initials of men who 
have graduated from here and who 
will go out into the world bringing 
glory to the school and Carnegie will 
be glad to have that remembrance of 
them.
The idea of Senior Privileges was 
first initiated at Yale-many years ago. 
Now practically all of the older col­
leges and universities of this country 
have these traditions which are not 
enforced by faculty action but are 
held inviolate by public opinion In 
the school. Carnegie Tech, because 
of its youth, had no Senior Privileges 
until the agitation in regard to them 
was begun this year.

Carnegio Toch debaters repeated

splitting oven in the second leg of 
the Pentangular Debates. The nega­
tive team, debating at home against 
Grove City was awarded a unanimous 
decision while the affirmative trio 
lost the decision at Beaver Falls in

The negative team with a more 
crystallized argument presented a se­

ALPHA ALPHA NU HOLDS
SEMI-ANNUAL INITIATION
Mr. Swope Informs u» that he 
was much Impressed by the appear­
ance of the robed scribes of the pen, 
at last general assembly. Ho only 
recently learned that they did not 
appear expressly in his honor, but In 
their own deification, also they were 
not members of the Klu Klux Klan, 
but Initiates of Alpha Alpha Nu, the 
honorary publication fraternity.
The following men are the new 
members: F. L. Knowles, E. M.
Stulta, H. A. Bowman, J. Franklin, 
J. K. Matter and D. Porterfield.
“One of the greatest causes for 
tlie failure of college students IsJ 
their inability to concentrate," de­
clared Dr. Tlios. S. Baker, acting 
president of Carnegie Tech, before 
the Industries) Assembly last Wednes­
day. Dr. Baker said that one of 
the most important things to be 
gained at college Is the ability to 
sit down to a job and not leave It 
until It has been mastered.
He also pointed out the value to 
college men of general reading dur­
ing summer vacations and the study­
ing of the dally newspaper. He de- 
clard that a collgo student should 
not be satisfied with merely the 
course of studies offerod at school 
but that ho ahould try to broaden 
his knowledge by reading and study­
ing subjects whlcli aro not related 
to his special course.
The Plobe Orchestra which has 
lately expanded and taken on the 
name of the Tartan Entertainers, 
furnished several excellent selections 
Which added much to tho Interest of 
the assembly.
President Godden announced that 
the assembly hereafter would be 
shorter and more Interesting and 
that he desired every man to con­
sider it hia duty to attend each 
week.
Recommendations for conducting 
the Art Students’ Ball in the future 
were presented to Arts assembly last 
week by William Burke, chairman of 
tills year's ball committee.
The treasurer also reported that 
there would be sufficient balance to 
pay the few bills yet outstanding.
A report from the student senate 
brought out the fact that thefe has 
been considerable misuse of school 
equipment which is of a vory superior 
order as compared with that at other 
schools. This misuse apparently is 
due to thoughtlessness and should be 
eliminated. There is also the matter 
of "petty taking" of things which is 
uncalled for and must, be checked or 
drastic action will bo taken.
Following general announcements 
came tho statement that something 
special would take place at the re­
mainder of tho assemblies providing 
a sufficiently large crowd attended. 
So got out to these assemblies and 
make them worth while.

CO-OPERATE WITH THE POINT SYSTEM COMMITTEE
Tlio Point System committee 1ms sent mimeographed forms to 
class officers and managers o£ the various activities. These forms are 
to be filled out and returned promptly. Usually not much import- 
!,nee is given to such forms mid it is only after much trouble and 
time lost, that the committees got the information they desire.
To put tho Point System into effect, a muss of detailed informa­
tion must be collected and iilcd iu such a manner, that it can readily 
be found. This job means that tho committee must apply themselvcrf 
earnestly to their task and it will require time. More time and work 
than the student body can appreciate. It is tlie plan of the Student 
Council to put the Point System in effect next, year and they hope to 
have enough data available for the class elections in May.
Fill out those forms now and see that the committee gets them 
Help the committee, because they to a large degree will be responsi­
ble for the success of the Point System. And the Point System must 
111! a success if our activities are lo be a succcss._____________________

COMMENTSROAMIN’S
8EEING THE UNSEEN
The title sounds paradoxical. "To
0 the unseen, how foolish” echo 
those who probably will never have 
tho slightest chance of seeing It. Yot 
It has a doep significance, tills see­
ing of the unseon, and wo shall do 
our host to explain it.
What is tho greatest quality neces­
sary to success today, real success 
that is, not the type Just happily 
stumbled upon at tbe instance of a 
smiling Dame Fortune? Thoro would 
be many answers given If the ques­
tion were put, say to any class of 
students. Some would judge persever­
ance to bo this necessary qualifica­
tion, others courage, other« ambition, 
still others training and education. 
But 110, there is still ono more beyond 
all these without which ono may have 
all the rest and yot remain doomed 
for life to the class of the mediocre. 
And that one thing 1b Imagination.
imagination moans vision, broad 
vision of the future, the ability to 
foresee tho coming, to estimate con­
sequences, results, needs. Without it 
there cannot be a successful captain 
of big industry.. Ho is paid heavily 
for Ills power of foresight, which usu­
ally amounts to something like gen­
ius, that Cod-given, unexplainable 
something which somehow exists in a 
person. And if a business man. nat­
urally tending to bo materialistic, 
cannot bo a great success Avltliout im­
agination, how much more does an 
artist in all senses of tho word need 
this intangible but nevertheless pres­
ent quality? Imagination was needed 
for the paintings of the old masters, 
vision was required for the exquisite 
poems of Tennyson.
Imagination is mainly born In one. 
It cannot be planted by the hand of 
man Into the soul of another fellow- 
being. But like many othor inborn 
qualities, it can most certainly be de­
veloped from the embryonic stage of 
an untutored and uncultured mind 
into a full bloBsom of creative activ­
ity. And here comes In the part of a 
university. She can broaden a mind 
from the narrow limits of modern 
utilitarianism to the large expanse of 
visionary culture unbounded by 
thoughts of mere gain. By teaching 
tlio full meaning of the past with all 
Its associations, by giving a broad
ducatipn, by making men think, not 
apo, not commit blindly to memory 
the thoughts of others, she can ac­
complish this task if the students 
themselves will but let her.
Remember that Solomon chose wis­
dom and all- the rest were added unto 
him. Seizo not'hold of that which may 
for the moment seem the most read­
ily turned to gain; but choose wise­
ly, seeking to develop powers of im­
agination, trying to see tlio unseen.— 
McGill Dally.
"Competition”
“Variety’s the spice of life,” so all 
the poets say. But life with just vari­
ety would bo a weary way. Our 
studies differ every day and that's 
varl6ty, but no one here enjoys them 
much so far as I can see.
When first v/e see a Maggie Murph 
whose face delights our eye, we try 
to make her notice us and finally by 
and by we get an introduction and 
ask if we may call. She looks at us 
and murmurs “Yea,” and right away 
we fall. Why number all the different 
tilings that happen on a date? most 
of us know and those who don’t, well, 
they're a little late in learning things 
they ought to know. But to resume 
our rime; you wander homeward feel­
ing that you've had a nifty time. Now 
competition is the thing that made 
tbe evening fair, she wouldn’t let you 
have your way, the fun began right 
there.
Well, later on some other guy 
around your girl you see, “I’ll show 
him up. that funny boob ain’t got a 
chance with me.” 'Tis competition 
once again and when you've finally 
won, you pat yourself upon the back 
any way “Well done, my son.” But 
when the competition’s o’er, the girl 
is all your own, she interests you no 
longer. You sit around and moan most 
all the time you're with her. She's 
¦silly at the beBt; you wonder howyou 
ever picked her out from all the rest. 
There is no competition any longer 
for this girl, you go and get another 
one from out the dizzy whirl. Now 
competition keeps you fit, puts pep 
into the day and that's the spice of 
life regardless of what poets say.

W. A. Magee Appointed 
On Committee of C. I. T.
Mayor William A. Magee has re­
cently been appointed to .fill the po­
sition on the committee for the Car­
negie Institute of Technology, made 
vacant by the death of Charles L. 
Taylor. The Mayor of Pittsburgh is 
an ex-officio member of (.lie Board 
of Trustees and with his position on 
the committee will be able to exer­
cise a very effective and beneficial 
influence on this institution. Mr. Ma­
gee bas shown a very intimate inter­
est in our school and will now be 
able to take an active part in Car­
negie Tech’s program.
. William Addison Magee, present 
Mayor of Pittsburgh, has held a 
prominent position in the public life 
of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh for 
a number of years. This fact is not 
capable of rare good judgment and 
decision in so many civic positions 
that it was but natural for him to be 
selected for more important duties.
Mr. Magee started his political ca­
reer in 1895, when lie was admitted 
to the Allegheny County Bar. He con­
tinued his law practice with remark­
able success until 1900, when he was 
elected to tbe common council from 
the Twenty-third Ward. He continued

you didn’t get your Tartan. Regular 
as clock work. On Wednesday morn­
ing. It’s a hard an tedious grind. But 
we’ve never failed you yet. So when 
the paper don’t suit you. One week 
with a dearth of news. Remember we 
never wait. Till the following week. 
And come out with something like 
this. “We’re sorry the paper wasn’t. 
Published last week. But there wasn’t 
any news.” Yet that same very cap­
tion. Appeared on a large college 
weekly. With a chance for as much. 
Nows as we have.
The ovont of last Thursday night 
was 1.110 rirst performance of B. Idon 
'ayne's.now play, “Dolly Jordan,” a 
biographical play dealing with the 
career of an English comodlonno con­
temporary with Mrs. Siddons.
Tho play presents diseonnoctod 
episodes marking tlio vacillations of 
a weak, amiable ladyol'looso morals.
The fil'Bl; act. Is marked With tho 
usual bnnnhitlos of exposition and 
the heroine at the ago of slxtoon Is 
Introduced to us. Sim proves to bo a. 
rather ordinary person and one does 
net fool that her success or failure 
as an actress Is essential to a, good 
night's sloop,
Miss Paxton is adequate as Mrs. 
Bland and Mr. Hoag does well as 
Daddy iSiwan. Mr. Caldwell’s Richard 
Daly, an Irish dandy with a brogue 
and French mannerism Is hard to 
swallow. Mr..'Caldwell remembers too 
much of his rolo of Trlssotln.
The second act presents Dolly Jor­
dan well 011 the road to success and 
in some respects is tlie host act of 
tlio play, being marred only by tho 
repetition of “Ecod,” which by this 
time has become unpleasant and an­
noying.
Miss Zeile and Mr. Reid are pre­
eminent in this act, both convincing 
in their respective characterizations. 
Miss Zeile’s “hands” are well deserv­
ed. Miss Osborne does the least im­
pressive work" we have seen her do, 
which perhaps may be due to mis­
casting. Mr. Hertz as Hobbes is not 
funny and Mr. Hayes’ shouting re­
calls only the burlesque comedian. 
Miss Ripley, as the call boy, is a 
touch that does much to convey the 
atmosphere of the green room. Others 
in this act are Messrs. Willard and 
Schangency.
The third act, although of exhaust­
ing length, is marked- by bits of ex­
cellent dialogue and effective panto­
mime. Miss Floyd Is unsatisfactory as 
Miss Sketehley, but one cannot cen­
sure her for tiring of elderly disap­
pointed virgin roles. Miss Kaufman 
as Ellen, spoalcs too fast, but her act­
ing is as good as, if not tho best 
of any slio has done recently,
Mr. Kappos as Captain Bailey, does 
not oonvoy any impression of tho 
character as revealed by tho linos, 
but his work has Improved Immeas­
urably slnoo tho “Dovll's Dlsciplo.” 
Mr. Paquin, as the Duke of Clar­
ence, does bis best with a trying rolo.
Tho fourth apt Is twonty-flvo years 
later and tho costumos assisted In a 
very small measure by the actors, 
mako this lapse soom quite real. 
Mias Cohen is to be commended. Wo 
do wish, though, that Miss Kaufman’s 
dross were more becoming and Mr. 
Caldwell’s coat loss vivid.
Mr. Held wins the sympathy of 
everyone as the now aged “Wander*
Hero's to you, Carnegie Freshman, 
you’re a funny lookin’ guy, 
With that little hat you’re wearln’

MAYOR W. A. MAGEE
only true of himself, but also for his 
ancestors, who came from Ireland in 
1788 and settled here ,in Pittsburgh. 
Mr. Magee had shown himself to be 
this position until 1901, when he was 
appointed to fill a vacancy in the 
iState Senate. He filled this position 
very ably until 1909.
In 1909 Mi*. Magee was elected 
Mayor of Plttsbui'gh on the Republi­
can ticket. Immediately upon enter­
ing office he began upon a campaign 
for the improvement of civic condi­
tions in Pittsburgh. Under his man­
agement “The Hump” was reduced 
by sixteen feet. He began an exten­
sive campaign of bridge building and 
beautified the city by many public 
improvements.
Intellectually he lias a deep inter­
est in municipal government, and is 
well-informed on the problems vital 
to the American city. Upon the insist­
ence of Mayor Magee the State Leg­
islature radically revised the system 
of municipal taxation. The purpose of 
this revision was to encourage house 
building and other Improvements, and 
to penalize the land speculator. UpOn 
Mayor Magee’s Initiative the legisla­
ture amended the city charter by cre­
ating tho health department, the city 
planning commission and the art com­
mission.

BASKETBALLSEASON 
CLOSES FOR PLEBESPLAID ATHLETICS
Schedule Was Completed in 
Favor of Carnegie Tech. 
Won Eight—Lost Five
The past season was a very suc­
cessful one for the Carnegie Tech 
Plebes. Starting the year as a re­
serve team, which was not particu­
larly successful, the team was re­
organized as a strictly Plebe team 
which made a wonderful showing, 
all facts considered.
The record for the year shows 
eight victories against five defeats. 
While this does not seem so im­
pressive, the fact remains, that in 
only one game were the Plebes de­
feated by over four points. The big­
gest surprise of the year was the 
defeat of Shadyside Academy, cham- 
pionsi of Section II of the W. P. I. 
A. L. In this game 'the Plebes out­
played their highly touted opponents 
throughout the game.
The success of the team is due to 
Coach "Bob” Waddell’s five-man de­
fense, coupled with a pair of for­
wards who could shoot from any 
angle of the 'floor. The defense of 
the Plebes was particularly impres­
sive. Opposing teams were forced 
to resort to long shots in an effort to 
score.
Captain “Midge” Matter was the 
leading point scorer for the Plebes, 
although “Kid” Murray led in the 
number of field goals. These two 
forwards formed an almost perfect 
pair whoi could pass and shoot as 
well as cover the floor. The guards, 
Broolc and Koppes, were practically 
green men at the start of the sea­
son, but th2y made up for their 
lack of experience by their fighting 
spirit, which soon made them fit in 
with* the rest of the team. The cen­
ter position was well filled by Oles 
until he was ruled ineligible. His 
•loss was a hard one to overcome and 
his position was subjected to some 
experiments until Eddie Gilbert 
clinched the position during the 
last few games.
The substitutes are deserving of 
a great deal of credit. Park was a 
valuable understudy of either forward 
or center. Bitner, Banlcier and 
Gardner also were able to step in­
to the combination at any time with­
out seriously weakening the team. 
Glass, Burns and Head also are due 
for a large amount of credit the way 
they kept - on day after day, al­
though ineligible to furnish opposi­
tion‘for the first five.
REGULATIONS COMMITTEE
TRY ARTS PLEBE GIRLS
The Sophomore girls at Arts have 
finally started in to do their duty 
and from now on the traditions of 
former »classes will not only be up­
held, tout an endeavor will also be 
'made to improve tiiem. So last Tues­
day, the seventh, about ten or fif­
teen of the miscreants were hailed 
•before the jury in the' loge and found 
guilty by the jury of the upper class 
girls. Charlotte Shuman, as judge, did 
her duty, but the jury seemed rather 
lenient. After the trial the culprits 
were taken down to the Foyer where 
a dance was in progress and were 
marched through the halls’, lock step, 
with their hair in pig tails, curls, etc. 
Gi;etchen Hoffman is chairman of the 
girls’ regulation committee.
This was only a starter and it is 
said that there are some offenders 
who will be referred to .the Student 
Senate and discipline committee for 
action if they don’t mend some of 
their wayward ways.
Their attitude is wrong and they 
have occasioned disfavor on account 
of it.
TRACK CAPTAIN FOR 1922
E. M. Stults, captain of thé 1922 
Plaid track squad, has been a consist­
ent performer in meets for several 
seasons. He is a pole vaulter and a 
good onei topping the bar around 11 
feet. In nearly every meet he has
ELWIN M. STULTS
carried off first honors, assuring the 
Tartans of some points in field 
events.
He is well liked by everyone, being 
familiarly known as Larry. He is a 
Senior in the P. & D. Department of 
the Arts School and a member of the 
following organizations: Delta/TJpsi-
lon fraternity, Delta Skull, Dragon,

INTER-FRATERNITY BASKET BALL
Inter-fraternity basket ball continues to hold sway. It will present for 
your approval this week its closing act in the nature of a post-season series 
between the winners of the three leagues. This series will decide who has 
the best team among the fraternities and dormitories. The first game was 
played last night. The remaining games will be played Thursday and Tues­
day nights, according to the schedule printed elsewhere on this sheet.
The games will be played in the gymnasium instead of the Langley Lab 
in order to accommodate the many supporters of the three toams combat­
ting for the cup. Everybody turn out and cheer your favorite on to victory. 
All three teams are good teams, and any one of the games should furnish 
thrills galore for the most rabid of basket ball fans.
Speaking of the championship cup, understand there will be a new one. 
It surely is needed, and will therefore be welcome indeed.
The assistant managers of basket ball did good work during the season 
just finished. Give it to them, fellows. They are: Keller, Kitcliell, Humbert, 
Bitner, Dyke, Duggan, Miller, Beardslee. Gordon and Carder. Manager Rob­
ert H. Carew handled his job in an efficient manner, and set a good prece­
dent for his successors to follow'.

DR. COTTRELL GIVES ADDRESS 
ON “NAT’L RESEARCH COUNCIL”
iDr. Cottrell gave an address on 
“National Research Council,” on Wed­
nesday, March. S. This meeting was 
attended by representatives of the 
Bureau of Mines, Mellon Institute, 
University of Pittsburgh Testing Lab­
oratories and several research labora­
tories of industrials concerns.
EXCHANGES
Cornell University has organized a 
class in basket ball officiating. The 
students will be given an opportun­
ity to referee at the varsity • scrim­
mages- and at intercollegiate inter­
fraternity and independent leagues 
games.
If sufficient ability is shown, the 
men will have a chance to be ap­
pointed by the committee in New 
York as approved' basket ball offic­
ials.
Development of a plan of athletics 
that will include every man register­
ed in the school is the plan of Ed. J. 
Manley, director of the intra-mural 
athletic league at the University of 
Illinois. The field of athletics at Illi­
nois includes 204 different teams in 
15 competitive sports.

ments when you have a let-
The other night while going home
Somewrhat later than usual

By a masked marauder
Who massaged my ribs

Each letter man at Oregqn Agricul­
tural College will hereafter receive a 
life time ticket admitting him to all 
athletic contests on the campus. The 
tickets will be made of aluminum, en­
graved with the athlete’s name, date, 
and sport in which he participated.
Because he censored an editorial in 
the Valante, paper of the University 
of North Dakota, which condemned 
the attitude of the faculty, President 
Slagle of that institution was hung 
in effigy by the students. Discontent 
towand the president has been grow­
ing among the students for some 
time.
Tulane University claims to have 
the “ideal girl.” Reports from the 
New Orleans school describe her as 
being slender, five feet four inches in 
height, weighing 115 pounds, and 
having large black eyes, black hair 
and a milk white complexion.
By the way, fellows, do any of you have an idea on "Who is to be the 
next basket ball captain?”
INFORMATION
The tennis season is about to start. So it might be of interest to the 
student'body to know that many things are being done to further the sport 
at Carnegie Tech. Always in the past our school has been noted for the 
manner in which its tournaments have been run off. Last year many com­
plimentary remarks were passed on that subject. This year more should be 
heard than ever before, for many improvements are to be made, each one 
of. which will work towards a bigger, better and finer tennis season, both 
from the point of view of the gallery and of the players.
There are always two considerations to be made in tennis tournaments: 
that of the player and that of the spectator. The player should always come 
flrst.
In order to make it better for the player, no spectators are to be allowed 
back of the courts—all must sit on the side. And, in order to encourage this, 
and further to act as a background for the player, green cloth will be tacked 
on the lower part of the wire backstop. This will serve two purposes—to 
prevent spectators from watching from back of the courts, and mainly, to 
act as a background against which the players can bettor keep their eye 
on the ball. ,
For the benefit of the gallery, the terraces around the courts will be 
sodded, and bleachers erected along side the tournament courts.
The tennis club now has nine nets in perfect condition. The not posts 
will be equipped with reels for tightening the net, in place of the clumsy 
method now in use. Later in the season a new'marker will be purchased.
A new system for keeping the courts in shape is now under considera­
tion, which if adopted, will work both for the good of the varsity men. as wrell as the non-varsity.
All in all, everything points toward a great tennis season, and thanks 
are due to the efficient handling of the tennis club funds by G. L. Tilbroolc.
DON’T THINK IT WILL WORK
In place of the old “goal after touchdown” rule, this one has been sub­
stituted, saying: ' -
"Goal from touchdown. When a touchdown has been made the 
side scoring the touchdown has possession of the ball anywhere on 
or outside the five-yard line for a scrimmage, from which by any 
legal play, as from an ordinary scrimmage, pass, kick, or run they 
anay score a field goal, or touchdown, and that the scoro of any char­
acter shall net them one point.”
According to the neAvspapers, it is a product of the thinkings of many 
football coaches throughout the country. Perhaps thoy know host, but this 
column thinks otherwise. The new rule has a few points to its credit; but 
many points to its discredit.
Every change made in any existing condition should work for an im­
provement. If it fails to be a benefit to the game, why Install it?
The old rule was not good, nor is this saying that the new ono will bo 
any better. The better thing along that line would have been to abolish 
this possibility of one point after each touchdown entirely, and let the six 
points from touchdown stand as the only score, with no chances given to increase.
Many games were won and lost, under the old ruling, by one point. 
Under the new ruling more games will be won and lost by the sixmo ono 
point. Every school was able to develop a kicker who could at least make a 
seventy-five or eighty per cent record of perfection In kicking this goal after 
touchdowns. (“Cy” Comfort made 100 per cent good.) But it is believed 
that only about one-third will be ablo to score that ono point by the now 
ruling. The success of this one-third over the oighty per cent will moan 
many more games lost by one point, than were lost by one point under the 
old ruling. What does this mean? Pure and simple, that many teams will 
he declared a winner when they should not, and vice versa—just as it always has been. ¦
Again, why take that additional chance of injury? Are the ono, two, 
three points additional to the touchdown scores worth that much? ONLY 
on one occasion is it, and that when the game ends in the same score for 
both toams. In other words, should a game end in a tie after the regular 
sixty minutes, then give the ball to each team, let them line-up in a scrim­
mage, and each have? the chance to try four plays by scrimmages, pafinos, 
kicks, or runs, apd the team that makes the largest gains In those plays ho 
awarded the one point, and consequently the game. A victory is much bettor 
than a tie, even when the victory is by tile narrow margin of ono point—thin, 
to both teams, and their supporters.
It is believed that a ruling as above suggested would eliminate all llkoll- 
hood of chance, and substitute in its place a case of victory on the merits 
of the team with the best football ability. The deciding of a victory on the 
ability of one single man would be eliminated. The deciding of a victory on 
a single play would be eliminated. But in four downs, with both teams lined 
up, knowing that on these four downs hangs victory1 or defeat, would put 
in their best efforts, determination, and fight, and as a result, the best team 
w'ould score the largest total yardage in four downs, and therefore win.

MAGGIE MURPH SENIORS
DEFEAT ARTS SCHOOL GIRLS
When the Seniors of Margaret 
Morrison hoard that the Arts Girls' 
basket ball team was to play them 
they immediately planned to show 
tliat they too had an eye for art. 
Their artistic temperament was shown 
by a representation of Made Sen- 
nett bathing parade.
It was a liard-fought game through­
out and the Design girls had the 
ball most of the time. It wfas only 
by. the clever shooting of "Issy” 
Winner and Helen Reed, both varsity 
forwards, that .the score was 2S to 
IS in favor of the Seniors.
You never hoard of a Design team 
before, did you? Of course not. 
They never practiced together and 
It was only when a schedule was 
given them that a team was formed. 
The lineup:

as far as he is concerned, tho busi­
ness slump is entirely over. In fact, 
Bert is getting so much trade lately 
that lie Is devising special means for 
handling tho rush. Baseball and 
track practice is the cause of it all; 
but Trainer Bert is happy, for ho 
knows full well that he is tho most 
important figure In the neighborhood 
of the athletic field.
The track men have been in train­
ing and working out for the past two 
weeks. The cinder track is rapidly bo- 
ing put Into shape and outdoor prac­
tice has already started. The track 
equipment is being materially improv­
ed by the addition ol’ twenty new 
hurdles and the complete renovation 
of the old ones.
Almost every event has several 
men competing for the position. Dyke- 
man, Tubbs, Fencil arid Greenlaw aro 
trying for the two mile run, while 
Blesch and J. G. Kelley are out for 
the mile und a half events. For tho 
440-yard run, there are Brumbaugh 
and Szold, and for the 220-yard Lock­
wood and .L M. Kelley. These , last 
two aro al30 competing in the 100- 
yard dash. R. A. Smith and Loclc- 
Avood are high jumpers, wrhlle Pittman 
hopes to again break the record in 
broad jumping. R. A. Smith and Ar­
nold aro both good hurdlers. Captain 
Larry Stultz Is a pole vaulter. Those 
trying for the weight events aro 
Schtlllngor, Berghund, Comfort, Kal- 
ablsch, Sprinlclo, Nesbit and Jonos. 
Besides thoso men thoro are many 
othor candidates, including a few 
Plobos who are showing good form.
An attractive schedule Is bolng ar­
ranged which, however, Is not yot

Psychological Discussion 
Led by Miss Humphreys
At the meeting of the Seminar of 
Psychological Eoaearch a dlscuHHlon 
of an administrative plan for montai 
testing was led by Miss Pauline 
Humphreys of the Psychology Depart­
ment, Miss Humphreys gavo the 
practical results of her years of work 
as psychologist for tlio Ethical Cul­
turo School In Now York City, and 
as director of Intelligence testing In 
the Contrai Missouri State Teachers' 
Col logo. Mis« Humphreys said that 
"The pressing demand of city schools 
for directors and examiners of public 
school children make« It Imperative 
that private Institutions aid tlio state 
schools In propping workers in this 
field.” Many interesting facts con­
cerning what Is being dono in other 
cities and the tentative as outlined

CARNEGIE TEAM AGAIN
BREAKS EVEN IN DEBATE
LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIE8 
PLAN RE8EARCH DEVELOPMENT
At the recent conference of the 
Life Insurance Research Bureau, 
March 7-10, officers representing 
twenty-one companies wore present, 
Most of the other companies are sit­
uated iR far from Pittsburgh that It 
was Impossible for them to send rep* 
resontatives.
Two committees of the member« 
present went over th<e plans for the 
research work that Gi being under­
taken and made «ome additions.
The first research of note will be 
an attempt by several thousand life 
Insurance agents to locate any dis­
tributions that can help In develop­
ing big producer«, and eliminate 
small producers.
The second main study will be the 
Comparison of the functions of the 
genoral agent, and the methods used 
in general agencies throughout the 
country. Report« of work already ac­
complished are being sent out to the 
companies.
Power to expel studonts without 
giving reasons to the faculty has been 
granted the undorgnuluato governing 
body of Princeton University. This 
body 1« composed of students elected 
by all the classos, and may exercise 
the right of dismissal of those whom 
they find guilty of not upholding the 
good name and traditions of Prince­
ton.

no mean« fell down on the job und In 
fact forced their opponents to the 
limit In a contest which was exceed­
ingly closo. In the matter, of oratory 
and debating technic honors wore 
about evenly divided. Geneva was 
represented by A. M. Mclsaac, D. S. 
Nogglo and John W. Pollins, while II. 
IC. Burr, .T. A. Silverman and .T. E. 
Kenney upheld the Tartan end of the 
contest.
With a chance to compare the 
teams put out by the various colleges 
usually thought of us productive of 
finished debaters it Is safe to say 
that although students of engineering, 
the men representing this Institution 
are well able to take their place ,1n 
thIi field of activity. In £lie funda­
mental theory of debate as well as a 
thorough knowledge of all tlio facts 
connected with the question under 
dlHcussIon, the fruits of Mr. Peter­
son's coaching are plainly evident.

gated the effects of cigarettes on boys 
and young men. Two hundred and

peared a striking superiority in non- 
smokers—superiority In athletes, In 
endurance, in scholarship and ambi­
tion.
A. I. E. E. HOLDS BANQUET
LAST SATURDAY NIGHT
(Continued From Page One.)
C alder wood and the entire group 
joined in on the annual get-together.
Local talent furnished the music— 
the electrical musical fonoms, or in 
short the E. M. F.’s, the personnel of 
which included Messrs. Bryan, Slee- 
man, Allison and Kost. Solos were 
also rendered by Allison and Slee- 
man, iSenior electricals.
The usual custom of distributing 
souvenirs ti the banquette!’« creat­
ed not a little excitement and many 
remembrances of a successful A. I. 
E. E. banquet wore carried off by 
those who attended.
Bill Says
Scholarship requirements at the 
University of Chicago were raised in 
an effort to limit attendance. The 
passing grade for the major students 
was made C, two grades higher than 
formerly.
"We are doing this to prevent an 
overflow attendance and to limit our 
graduates to the highest possible 
grade of students,” said’ Dean D. A. 
Robertson.
"What has four feet and files in the 
air?"
"I’ll bite.”
"Two pigeons.”
Spring Js In the air and with the 
approach of warmer weather in for­
mer years one was sure to wake UP 
one flue morning and see a banner 
Inscribed with Plebe numerals flying 
in the breezes and out of reach of 
watchful Sophomores.
An Incident of this kind has tak­
en place overy year on our campus 
It baa become a sort of tradition In­
delibly fixed on the mind of every 
Carnegie undercflassman. Are the
Pleb.es of this year going to allow 
Qualification Day to come around 
without having shown some signs of 
life and class spirit to test the 
strength of the Sophomores? Former 
Plebe classes always put up some 
sort of a banner, rudely inscribed 
with the class numerals. In addi­
tion to that they did more. Armed 
with paint and brushes they painted 
the campus, the buildings, the walks, 
In fact left nothing untouched. Even 
though they may have shown a little 
(life and spirit in displaying their 
numerals in this way they destroyed 
or at least damaged school property, 
they brought expense on the institu­
tion which is giving them an educa­
tion and instead of bringing honor 
on thé class they brought disgrace.
Plebes of '25, as yet you have shown 
little in the way of class spirit, 
with the possible exception of the 
Plobe banquet.
Everyone enjoys a little display 
of class enthusiasm. Why not start 
something? Don’t paint up the 
campus or do anything to harm the 
school or public property. Don’t 
bring discredit on the Plebe class 
but do something to wake up the' 
slumbering Sophomores who have 
fallen asleep at thélr post. Put up 
your banner or start some new tradi­
tion and show that the Plebes have 
some class spirit. But forget the 
paint and defacing of school prop­
erty. .

William Stanley
—and the Alternating Current Transformer
There is nothing that compares with elec­
tricity for the economical transmission of power. 
As a matter of fact, energy in any other form can 
be economically transmitted only for the shortest 
distances. If a power need develops, and its 
location iii more than a few hundred yards from 
the power house, the engineer at once turns to 
the electrical method for cheap and reliable 
transmission.
To the thousands who are living their lives in 
the earlier days of the Electrical Age, it probably 
seems that this situation must have always 
existed. But actually, there is many a man with 
no gray in, his hair can recall the days when 
electric light and power were literally unknown.
The tremendous electrical transmission sys­
tems that have been developed during the past 
thirty years owe their existence to the fact that 
they are practically, as well as technically, 
right. They provide cheaper power than would 
otherwise be possible; and production, and the 
creation of real values, always requires com­
paratively low-priced power for its highest 
development. And the history of low-cost 
power transmission is the history of Alternating 
Current, and especially of the Alternating Cur­
rent Transformer. For one of the great factors 
in the cost of electrical systems is the cost of con­
ductors—wires....and the big thing about alter­
nating current, is that it makes possible the use of 
conductors which are within the cost-limits which 
competitive and economic conditions impose.
There is no room to discuss all the varied as­
pects of this question; but it may be said that 
one of the great fundamentals that has led to the 
use of alternating current transmission for about 
95% of the electrical systems now in use has been 
its great economy, as compared to other systems, 
in the transmission of power. And the trails- ¦ 
former, itself, is the heart of the alternating 
current system.
It permits a small current, at high voltage, to 
be transformed to a large current at low voltage, 
or vice versa, through the use of simple, immobile 
apparatus, and thus supplies the essential factor 
in electrical transmission.
William Stanley is remembered because it was. 
lie who commercially developed transformers of 
high efficiency and satisfactory regulating quali­
ties. He brought out the first system in which 
the transformers were connected in parallel,. 
across a constant-potential system, instead of 
the series operation used by Gaulard and Gibbs. 
The system embodying this principle was put 
into operation at Great Barrington, Mass., on 
March 16, 188(5, and has been the standard 
method ever since.
Thus briefly is recorded the history of an­
other contribution of the Wcstinghouse engi­
neering organization to the electrical art; since 
all the transformers which are made today are 
built upon the same general principles as those 
first constructed to embody William Stanley’s 
inventions.

Princeton University plans to erect 
a new chajpel with dimensions ap­
proaching those of a small cathe­
dral. When completed it will be one 
of the largest university chapels in 
the world, being only a trifle smaller 
than the chapel of King’s College at 
¦Cambridge. It is estimated that the 
cost will exiceed a million dollars, 
and when filled to capacity it will 
seat over two thousand people.

2G had been selected as the most suit­
able date for Poverty Day. This date 
was approved by Council.
A committee composed of Irwin, 
Henderson and Nation was appointed 
to confer with the presidents of the 
various men’s dormitories. An effort 
will be made to effect a stronger or­
ganization among the men’s dormi­
tories so that the conduct of the men 
living in the dormitories can be better 
controlled.
