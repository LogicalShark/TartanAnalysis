ars, who would not be available 
on a permanent basis, to join the 
faculty as visiting professors for 
restricted periods of time from 
one month to a year.

(3) Allotment of the remainder 
of the income of the fund to the 
improvement of the salaries of the 
faculty providing instruction to 
students in the College of Fine 
Arts in order to assure the reten­

By Sally Ganong
Stanley R. March, director of public relations at Carnegie 
ech, has been appointed director of information services of 
e Pittsburgh Public Schools and will assume this position 
tuiary 1, 1959. During a recent interview, Mr. March ex- 
Jfsed his observations of Tech students and campus

Career at Tech 
m the beginning of his career

Development Program
The development program is the 
ajor change Mr. March has seen

For Boys’ Home
The Men’s and Women’s Dorm

mas Party for the 93 orphans of 
the Toner Institute in Brookline. 
The boys range from si:c to four­
teen years of age.
The party will begin at 2.00 p.m. 
on Saturday, December 13, and will 
include many varied activities. 
Food, refreshments, movies, games, 
singing, and other events are be­
ing planned. Santa will be there 
to distribute gifts to each boy. 
There is a possibility that even 
Mrs. Santa may make an appear­
ance.
The men and women in the 
dorms are welcomed to join in the 
fun. This is the second year for 
such an affair and it is hoped that 
it will become an annual activity.
Traditional Music 
Will Highlight 
Christmas Chapel
The annual Tech Christmas as­
sembly, sponsored by the/ College 
of Fine Arts, will be held in the 
foyer of Fine Arts next Tuesday, 
December 16, at 11:30.
As in past years Christmas 
music, including carol singing, 
will comprise the main part of the 
program. Dr. John Warner will 
deliver the President’s message 
and the Reverend Hugh S. Clark 
will offer the prayer. The Nativity 
from St. Luke will be read by 
Alan Lindgren of the Drama De­
partment.
Selections will be given by the 
Music Department and Cameron 
Choirs, under the direction of Ro­
bert Hamilton and Mr. Richard 
Camp, respectively.
To help reduce the amount of 
time spent by students in the 
registration area, the plan for pre­
payment of fees will be in effect 
for the Spring Semester 1958-59. 
All students may participate in the 
plan except students in the fol­
lowing categories:
1. Students who will be carry­
ing 24 units or less.
2. Junior and Senior Painting
and Design students.
Those students who are not ex­
cluded and who wish to partici­
pate in the plan will proceed as 
follows:
At any time during the period 
of January 12 through January 28, 
students may stop at the Regis­
trar’s Office and make their pay­
ments. However, it must be under­
stood that for dormitory students, 
the dormitory fee must be paid at 
the same time.
It also should be understood 
that all students, whether parti­
cipating or not, must appear at 
the registration area the same as 
always to complete schedules and 
fill out IBM forms, but the stu­
dents who have prepaid their fees 
will not be required to go to the 
Women’s Gym where the Cashier 
will be set up.
Mrs. Jonas Salk 
Speaks To Frosli 
Maggie Murphys
By Arlene Logioco
Mrs. Jonas Salk, wife of Dr. 
Salk of polio vaccine fame, was 
guest speaker at the Thursday, No­
vember 20 freshman orientation 
program at Margaret Morrison. 
Her appearance was made possible 
through the efforts of Mr. Stein­
berg and the general studies de­
partment.
Although srie doesn’t make a 
practice of speaking before college 
groups, Mrs. Salk said that she 
made Tech an exception because 
of the “undying perseverance of 
the staff.” She also added, exem­
plifying her sense of humor, that 
she came last year and couldn’t 
say no.
This conservative woman at­
tended Smith College and did 
graduate work at the New York 
Schol of Social Work.
Individualism
She spoke to the girls about the 
value of a liberal arts education. 
Stressing the values of individual­
ism, Mrs. Salk said that conform­
ity was perfectly alright in a so­
cial set provided that the person 
knows why he is conforming and 
has his own set of standards. 
“People should think for them­
selves, as individuals, and do what 
is right.”
Education is a life-long process 
and college helps one to see the 
realizations about knowledge; 
namely, that knowledge is change­
able, but wisdom remains the 
same. Mrs. Salk added that “lib­
eral education should end with 
life only.”
Financial Aid
Beginning December 1 the 
office of the Committee on Fi­
nancial Aid will be moved to 
Administration Hall, Room 
"54 A. The campus telephone 
extension will be 216.

will be 25c for each pair of shoes 
shined. The girls will be around 
to the fraternity houses and the 
men’s dorms between 6 and 7:30 
p.m.

Youngstown, Ohio.
This was the second group of 
Indian trainees to undergo four 
days a week on-the-job training 
in steol mills and one day a week 
in specialized studies on the cam­
pus. They have been preparing 
for one year for their roles in the 
management and operations of
two new one-million-ton capacity 
steel mills now under construc­
tion in their country.
Participants 
The Jones & Laughlin Steel 
Corporation, the Weirton Steel 
Company, and Tech have partici­
pated jointly in the training of 
the 30 men who received certif­
icates of achievement November 
25 in the Fine Arts Theatre.

Pittsburgh Bicentennial CotL 
Recalls Early History
By Mike Brunt
In response to the great interest in Pittsburgh’s Bicen­
tennial Celebration the following is a brief resume of Pitts­
burgh’s early history.
In 1753, George Washington paid the Pittsburgh area one
of the first visits ever graced by*--------------?--------------------------------------
a white man. He was only passing 
through this area on his way to 
visit French forces occupying 
Northwestern Pennsylvania. How­
ever, on November 23, 1753 he 
reached the fork of the Ohio, bet­
ter known as the Point. On this 
day Washington wrote in his diary 
“. . . the land in the fork; I think 
extremely well situated for a fort, 
as it has the absoulte command of 
both rivers.”
First Forts 
The Ohio Company of Virginia 
had planned to build a fort in this 
area and after several considera­
tions of location, it chose Wash­
ington’s site. Several forts and the 
town grew up around the Point. 
It seems only fitting, therefore, to 
speak of George Washington as 
the one who “located” Pittsburgh.
In 1754 a captain William Trent 
was commissioned by the British 
Colony of Virginia to build and 
garrison a fort at the Point. Work 
was begun on the fort in February 
of that year. Since the fort was a 
British outpost it was named Fort 
Prince George in honor of the fu­
ture King of England.
French Victory 
In April of 1754, the Governor- 
General of French Canada sent an 
expedition of 500 men against the 
fort v/hich had only 51 men gar­
risoned there at that time. The 
British surrendered the fort with­
out a struggle and the French de­
stroyed Fort Prince George. In its 
place they built a new fort, Fort 
Duquesne.
The French remained in control 
of the fort until November 25, 1758 
when General John Forbes led his 
troops in a campaign against 
ill-fated Fort Duquesne. General 
Forbes gained control of Fort Du­
quesne without bloodshed, for 
when the French learned from 
their Indian confidants of the 
size of General Forbes’ troops, they 
hastily left the fort. When Forbes 
arrived all that was left were the 
smouldering remains of the once 
proud Fort Duquesne.
Pittsburgh Named 
Two days after the capture of 
Fort Duquesne General Forbes 
named the land at the Point “Pitts­
burgh” in a letter to Prime Min­
ister William Pitt, quote, “Sir . . . 
I have used the freedom of giving 
your name to Fort Duquesne, as 
I hope it was in some measure the 
being actuated by your spirits that 
now makes us the masters of the 
place.” In this way, Pittsburgh 
became the British gateway to the 
upper Ohio valley and the West 
In 1759 Brigadier General John 
Stanwix arrived with army en­
gineers and began the building of 
Fort Pitt. By 1761 the fort was 
completed and in and around the 
fort were some two hundred 
houses and huts, plus the first 
school of Pittsburgh.
Bushy Run 
In 1763 there was fear of an 
Indian siege at Fort Pitt, but Colo­
nel Henry Bouquet defeated the 
Indians at Bushy Run, thus re­
lieving the siege of Fort Pitt. He 
remained at the Fort and in 1764 
built the Blockhouse for increased 
fort protection. The Blockhouse is 
the only remaining evidence of the 
fortification of Fort Pitt.
In 1772 the British government 
abandoned Fort Pitt, and in 1774 
the fort was taken into the pos­
session of the Virginia Militia.
By 1783 trade was beginning to 
flourish to a noticeable degree in 
Pittsburgh; trade which was just 
the beginning of the blossoming of 
a whole new era of economic trade 
and expansion which in time made 
Pittsburgh the thriving metropolis 
it is today.
In 1787 the Pittsburgh Academy 
(University of Pittsburgh) was in­
corporated. It was endowed with
5000 acres of wilderness land. 
However, the first classes were not 
held until March, 1789.
Growing City 
By the end of the 1700’s many 
passing through Pittsburgh began 
to notice its new, fresh vitality as 
a growing American city. A trav­
eler from Ireland remarked of 
Pittsburgh in 1789, “Pittsburgh is 
a neat, handsome town ... It is 
t expected the town will, in a few 
years, become the emporium of the 
western country.” Even at this 
early age men realized the manu­
facturing potential of Pittsburgh. 
We have evidence of this in a 
statement by a writer for. the 
Pittsburgh Gazette, “H o w- 
ever important the conveyance 
may be . . . the importation of 
heavy articles will still be ex­
pensive; the manufacturing of 
t/if.m, therefore will become more 
of an object here than elsewhere.” 
We can see, therefore, even in 
those early formative years of 
Pittsburgh, the budding and grow­
ing hopes and ambitions of a 
young freedom loving people striv­
ing for full maturity. Today Pitts­
burgh can contently enjoy her 
200th birthday knowing that she 
has fulfilled these early dreams 
and ambitions.
December 14: “Christmas
Around the World” song pageant. 
Pittsburgh’s various nationality 
groups will present two concerts 
of Christmas carols at Carnegie 
Music Hall. The program will in­
clude songs and choruses in Latin, 
Welsh, German, Croatian, Span­
ish, Irish, Serbian, Phillipine, Rus­
sian, and many other national ton­
gues.

are “La Traviata,” “Marriage of 
Figgaro,” “Fledermaus,” “Can- 
Can,” “Oklahoma,” and “Naughty 
Marietta.”
Plans
As director of the show, Jim 
“plans to coordinate the whole 
club into a more productive or­
ganization through an understand­
ing of the technical side of the-
ater and the development of long- 
lasting friendships.’ He would like 
Scotch and Soda to mean some­
thing to its members long after 
they’ve left Tech.
Ron Barron, senior P and D, 
predicts an exciting, colorful pro­
duction this year. He’s been in 
the club for four . years. Ron 
started as a dancer and was elect­
ed to the board in his sophomore 
year. Last year he was assistant 
director of “Harmony” and now 
he’s vice president of the board.
This Year’s Cast
Under the auspices of these two 
experienced seniors, ‘this year’s 
cast will be larger than ever be­
fore and a system is being devised 
so that each cast member won’t 
have to rehearse every night of 
the week. There will be more than 
two principal leads and the stag­
ing of the show will be entirely 
different than in the past.
With the combination of both 
quality and quantity, the directors 
are hoping to make the club na­
tionally known this year. They 
want everyone with any kind of 
talent, no matter how small, to 
try-out for the show.
Directory Lists 
Staff, Speakers
A speaker’s directory, aimed at 
serving the Pittsburgh commu­
nity, has been established at CIT 
as announced November 24.
The directory, which is com­
posed of Carnegie faculty and 
staff members, lists lecturers who 
are qualified to speak authorita­
tively about a wide range of tech­
nical and non-technical subjects.
The speaker’s directory is de­
signed to provide speakers for 
service groups and educational 
and professional organizations. 
Some of the subjects which 
speakers are capable of dealing 
with include: earth satellites,
mental health, the theater, sci­
ence, human relations, business 
communications, engineering, psy­
chology, painting, design and 
sculpture, religion, music, foreign- 
student programs, university re­
search and vocational oppor-
tunities. It was announced pre­
sentations, with illustration, about 
life in India, Norway, England, 
Japan, and Korea can also be pro­
vided.
Cameron Choir 
Presenting Annual 
Christmas Concert
Tech’s Cameron Choir will take 
part in the annual Christmas As­
sembly next Tuesday, December 
16.
On December 2, Cameron Choir 
entertained two area high schools, 
Coraopolis and Moon Township. 
The program presented to both 
student bodies consisted of a va­
riety of songs. Included were: 
“We Are the Music Makers” by 
Mueller; “The Cherubim Song” 
by Tschaikovsky; “Snow White 
Fantasy” by Morey and Churchill; 
“You Got to Have Heart” by Alder 
and Ross; “Ezkiel Saw a Wheel”; 
“Glory to God in the Highest” by 
Pergolesi; and the Fred Waring 
arrangement of “Silver Bells.” 
The choir concluded the program 
with a medley of Tech songs.
3.00 Or Top Fifth 
Needed To Make 
Neiv Honor List
New qualifications for the Dean’s 
List as set up last spring are now 
in effect. Instead of the 3.15 factor 
formerly required, the top 20% of 
the students in each college are 
plaecd on the honor list. How­
ever, no student, even if he is in 
the upper fifth, makes Dean’s List 
if his average is below a 3.00.
The new regulations were made 
up by the executive board, con­
sisting of the college deans and 
other administrative officials.

ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE: NO. 1
“The proper study of mankind is man,” said Geoffrey C'haucer 
in his immortal Casey At the Bat, and I couldn’t agree more. In 
these tangled times it is particularly proper to study man —how 
he lives and works. Accordingly, this column, normally devoted 
to slajxlash waggery, will from time to time turn a serious eye 
on the social sciences.
In making these occasional departures, I have the hearty ap­
proval of the makers of Philip Morris Cigarettes, whose interest 
is not only in providing young Americans with fine cigarettes, 
matchlessly blended of vintage tobaccos, grown with loving 
care and harvested with tender mercy, then cured with com­
passionate patience and rolled into firm tasty cylinders and 
brought to you in long size or regular, in soft pack or flip-top 
box, at prices which wreak no havoc on Lhe most stringent of 
budgets, but who are equally concerned with broadening the 
minds and extending the intellectual vistas of every college 
man and woman!
I, for one, am not unmoved by this great-heartedness, and 
though I know it is considered chic these days to disparage one’s 
employers, I'shall not. Indeed, I shall cry “Iluzzah!” for the 
makers of Philip Morris. I shall cry “Huzzah!” and “Viva!" 
and “010!” and “Ochichoonya!”
But I digress. For our first lesson'in social science, let us 
turn to economics, often called the queen of the social sciences. 
(¡Sociology is the king of the social Sciences. Advertising is the 
jack.)
Economics breaks down into two broad general classifica­
tions: 1) coins; 2) folding money. But before taking up these 
technical aspects, let us survey briefly the history of economic».
I IV» M.t
The makers of Philip Morris are no economists, but they do 
understand supply and demand. Some people demand filter 
cigarettes, so they supply the finest—Marlboro, of course! 
Great flavor, improved filter—o lot to like I
Economics was discovered by the Englishman, Adam Smith. 
He published his findings in 1786, but everybody giggled so 
hard that Smith, blushing hotly, gave up the whole thing and 
went into the cough drop business with his brother.
For long years after that economies lay neglected while the 
world busied itself with other things, like the birth of Vic for 
Hugo, the last days of Pompeii, and the Bunny Hug.
Then one day while flying a kite during a thunderstorm, the 
American, Henry George (also called Thorstein Veblen), dis­
covered the law of diminishing returns, and then, boy, the fat 
was in the fire! Before you could say “knife” the Industrial 
Revolution was on! Mechanization and steam power resulted 
in prodigies of production. For example, before the Industrial 
Revolution, a Welsh artisan, named Dylan Sigafoos, list'd to 
make horse-shoes by hand at the rate of four a day. After the 
Industrial Revolution, with the aid of a steam engine, Sigafoos 
was able to make entire horses!
And so it went—factories rising from the plains, cities bur­
geoning around the factories, transport and commerce keeping 
pace—until today, thanks to economics, we have smog, reces­
sions, aud economics textbooks at $7.50 per copy.

Building For The Future
The Tartan has recently announced that 
Tech has been granted two large sums of 
money in connection with the development 
program ($2,800,000 from Mr. and Mrs. Roy A. 
Hunt and $5,000,000 from the Mellon Trust). 
The addition of these two sums to that al­
ready collected brings the development pro­
gram within 30% of its original goal. Raising 
such a large sum of money in so short a time 
is truly amazing.
However, what is even more amazing is 
that so little has been done with this money 
that the Tech student has no way of know­
ing that it has been collected! Whether or 
not the delays in the building program have 
been justifiable has little effect on the obvi­
ous disappointment of many Techites. In 
fact, the Tartan feels that if the delays last 
much longer, the income from the interest 
on this money should be enough to delay the 
scheduled tuition increase for perhaps a year.

The Role of Honoraries
By John Olmsted and Bill Rich
What is the proper role of ac­
tivities honoraries on a college 
campus? On Tech’s campus the 
activities honoraries, as organized 
groups, play a very important part 
in student affairs; in fact, at times 
they have acted as the govern­
mental agency for the student 
body.
With the advent of Student Con­
gress, the honoraries’ role in gov­
ernment has been reduced, but 
remnants of their one time posi­
tion remain, in the chairmanships 
of the various external committees 
in Congress: Freshman Orienta­
tion, Homecoming, Spring Carni­
val, etc.
Position of Honor
It is our contention that the ac­
tivities honoraries should be just 
that: honoraries. As individuals, 
the members of the honoraries are 
in positions of high responsibility 
on campus; else they would not 
have been called by the honoraries. 
Why should further burdens of re­
sponsibility, which could easily be 
borne by other students, be thrust 
upon these already busy individ­
uals by requiring that committee 
chairmen be members of honor­
aries.
Proponents of this plan have 
said that honorary members have 
more experience, and proven abili­
ties, in this type of work and 
thus are natural choices for the 
positions. However, experience 
shows that often the members 
picked for committee heads jobs 
know less about their position at 
the outset than would, for instance, 
someone who worked on the com­
mittee the previous year.
More Qualified
Even if it is true that the mem­
bers of honoraries are more quali­
fied, it does not necessarily follow 
that chairmanships should be re­
stricted to honorary members. If 
these people are most qualified, 
the jobs will be theirs by appoint­
ment anyway. Removing the stip­
ulation that a committee chairman

must be an honorary member 
would not mean that the chairman 
of Student Congress could not 
choose a member of an honorary 
for such a position; but it would 
mean that he could also choose 
other qualified individuals.
A problem created in part by 
the present restrictions is that of 
poor distribution of responsibility 
among students. A survey of 
leaders of campus organizations 
will show that there is a very 
small group of very able individ­
uals doing most of the adminis­
trative work. Not only does this 
situation mean that some individ­
uals are bearing a greater load of 
responsibility than they can ade­
quately handle, but also a large 
number of other students, possibly 
equally qualified, are not getting 
-the opportunity to develop their 
leadership capacities.
Role of Activities
If the role of campus activities 
be, in part, to develop leadership 
potential, and this we believe it to 
be, then the present situation of 
overconcentration of responsibility 
means a failure of activities to ful­
fill this role. Those who are al­
ready in activities are developing 
their potentials. Why not then 
spread the responsibility, and 
with it the opportunity to develop 
an increasing number of potential 
leaders?
We are not advocating that the 
honoraries be made mere titular 
organizations, meeting only for the 
purpose of selecting their success­
ors. This, indeed, would be a 
waste of one of the prime sources 
of campus which await only the 
action of a responsible, able group 
to be set into motion. It should, 
we feel, be the role of the honor­
aries to tackle these projects and 
see that they are organized and 
carried to completion.
Excellent Example
An excellent example of this 
type of function by an honorary 
was the recent revision of the en­
tire student government by ODK 
and Mortar Board. This task 
needed to be done; it had to be 
done well; and it had to be done 
by a group that was familiar with 
exitsing campus organization. 
Here was the perfect spot for the 
honoraries to step in and do a 
needed job.
This, then, is what we advocate: 
that the activities honoraries, as 
such, retire from the realm of the 
more or less permanent function­
ing of student government; that 
they confine themselves, instead, 
to consideration of and solution of 
the problems of a special nature 
which beset th£ campus. Such 
problems include any for which 
there is no specific student agency 
willing and equipped to tackle 
them. This role would be of far 
I greater benefit to the campus as 
a whole, to other students, and to 
the honoraries themselves.
I have often wondered why some peopM 
are popular and others are not, why som| 
people seems to have no enemies and otheij 
no friends. I thought that popularity migh 
be a function of a person’s inherited characj 
teristics, for the good-looking athlete cerj 
tainly seems to have more friends tha^nis 
less robust associates. Then I began to won 
der if Mr. Touchdown with his bevy of ad 
mirers is truly popular. At this point I rea 
ized, as always, that my thinking had bogge 
down because I had failed to define popu| 
larity.
Popularity
I prefer to think of popularity not in th 
usual way. I feel that a person who is.^ 
popular is not one whose name appears 
'great number of times in the school papei] 
or one who is referred to as a BMOC, but rather one wh 
has one or a number of true friends and acquaintances wh 
think of him as a potential friend. A popular person, a persoj 
who can obtain true friends, is one who is sincere, for in 
sincerity though often cleverly disguised is soon spotted evej 
by the most imperceptive person. An insincere person ca 
never have true friends.
Selflessness
Closely allied with sincerity is that of selflessness. I 
not mean to say that a popular person must be completed 
selfless, for this is impossible. I mean rather that he shoull 
be aware that there are others in this world besides himself 
and knowing this he must be able to feel their successes ar 
misfortunes. Freud says that this is impossible, that man is I 
selfish animal with no true capacity for empathy, but I heart] 
ily, though humbly, disagree. I feel that one of the true 
ings of our intelligence is our ability to feel for another, 
an obscure but wise poet once said,
“Be your neighbor’s pain your own 
And truly, truly, felt
That neighbor’s more than neighbor-kind 
He’s friend, or love, or self.”

iIKReaders Write
/M’S Demand Retraction
Editor, The Tartan:
In the October 21 issue of the Tartan a small group of i)], 
tellectual adolescents pedding their literary garbage imdei 
the pseudonym of “Blenheim” initiated a vicious rumor co 
concerning the quality of the 19594 
graduating class in the Industrial 
Management Department.
Since this group did not have 
the courage to identify themselves 
nor give evidence for their insin­
uation, we though the best course 
to follow was to rely on the better 
judgment of the Tartan readers 
and let the invective die of its 
own malignancy. However, we 
have been made to believe that 
this irresponsible rumor was ac­
cepted as fact by some of the stu­
dent body.
No Defense
We shall not try to make a de­
fense of our class until we are 
confronted with evidence that re­
quires rebuttal. This evidence is 
something which the immature 
Blenhiems obviously will not be 
able to produce. We therefore, de­
mand the editors of the Tartan 
unconditionally - retract the state­
ment made in the Tartan on Octo- 
be 21 and publicly reveal the 
group responsible for its origin.
In the interests of the other 
classes and departments on cam­
pus which still remain fair game 
for the type of journalistic “black­
jack treatment” to which we have 
been subjected, we also demanij 
that, in the future, the editors 
the Tartan, being wholly or par* 
tially responsible for editorialize 
comment which appears in theii| 
newspaper, use common sense 
fore printing damaging ru^c 
that have no basis in fact.
We sincerely feel that the sti 
dent body is entitled to something 
much better than the dyspeptics 
brand of journalism which the 
group called "Blenheim” has been 
trying to foist upon them this 
semester.

Tech Parking
* The automobile owners at Tech, 
% who park behind the Administra­
tion Hall, Industrial Administra­
tion, and Skibo buildings, have no 
consideration for the other stu­
dents. One day I counted at least 
five cars which were parked be­
tween two spaces. This means that 
five persons were deprived of 
parking because of the careless­
ness of their fellow students.
If everyone will double-check

parking situation would be some­
what improved.

Freshmen Respond 
To Congress’ New 
Apprentice Plan
A very fine response to the Stu­
dent Congress apprenticeship pro- 
^ gram was received from freshmen 
® at the last meeting according to 
Congress president Bob Cleveland.
Thirty-five to fifty students 
registered to work as committee 
apprentices this year after hearing 
a report from each Congressional 
committee and a description of its 
functions.
Much interest was shown to­
ward work of a direct social na­
ture, such as is performed by 
^ Spring Carnival committee. Ap- 
* plications were received not only 
by standing committees, but for a 
special group appointed to assist 
INSTEP students.

Girls’ Answer
We freshman girls would like to 
make a statement concerning Carl 
E’s letter in reference to us fresh­
men girls. Mr. E, an I.M. student, 
said that we walk at an average 
speed of 5 mph. Since an average 
man walks about 4 mph, we con­
sider our speed sufficient to allow 
Mr. E to class on time. Moreover, 
how could we flirt with the boys 
if we are walking a mile an hour 
faster than they are?

The primary reason, however, 
for the program is to give fresh­

“They told me exactly what to expect,” 
be says. “Every phase of my training, 
covering two years of rotational job as­

easy for me to see where 1 could go.”
Since Stu was hired, he’s climbed 
poles, installed telephones and worked 
with architects and contractors. He’s de­

Tech Downs ISTC, 
Loses To Dukes
By Mike Berman
Duquesne
Some 2050 spectators were on 
hand December 1 to see the Tar­
tan hoopsters drop their season 
opener to Duquesne, 63-43, at the 
Pitt Field House.
The Skibos, ¦premiering their 
new warm-up perseys and playing 
uniforms, dropped their twenty- 
second in a row to the Dukes but 
managed to keep within striking 
distance throughout most of the
first half.

The Tartans were first to score 
on a free throw by forward Stan

The courtmen from Indiana 
State Teachers College proved 
little match for the mighty Tech 
floormen December 3 as the Ski­
bos took their first of the season, 
73-60.
The contest, quite opposite from 
last year’s double overtime bat­
tle, witnessed the Tartans’ fine 
shooting ability and introduced a 
talented freshman ball handler, 
Bob Hauser, to the scene.
Hauser and his fellow Duquesne 
High graduate Bill Soffa clicked 
together beautifully in the second 
half to put the Skibos way out of 
reach of Indiana State.

IM All School 
Football Team 
Is Announced
The 1959 all school football 
team was chosen by the IM Board 
and Managers club and is compos­
ed of a fast moving offense and 
a strong defensive team.
The ends are Don Casey of 
Kappa Sigma and Bob Rapp of the 
Met Grads. Casey led his team in 
the playoffs and could get down- 
field for the long scoring pass that 
gave the K Sigs several victories. 
Rapp was particularly sharp in 
the finals and could come up with 
the big catch that allowed the 
Met Grads to win their first foot­
ball championship.
All league cenler was Ed Pa- 
sierb of the Met Grads. He was a 
fine blocker and gave his qaurter- 
back much time to throw the ball. 
He could also catch the short pass 
when they needed yardage.
The all school backfield was 
composed of Jim Bennett of ATO, 
John Murphy of the Citcom team 
and Chuck Vodvarka of SAE. Ben­
nett was the ATO’s big offensive 
threat as he could pass sharply 
and throw the long pass when 
necessary. Murphy was Citcom’s 
fine running quarterback and 
could throw a sharp pass when he 
had to. Vodvarka of SAE wasfor the easy victory (73-60), but ^ their fine running and quick pass-

Pagre 8—CARNEGIE TARTAN—Wednesday, December If, 1958
Roger W. Anliker 
Exhibition To Be 
Held In Fine Arts
The CIT College of Fine Arts 
has announced an exhibition by 
Roger W. Anliker, associate pro­
fessor in the department of 
painting, design, and sculpture, 
which will be shown in the Hew­
lett Gallery in Fine Arts through 
December 16. The collection will 
include paintings, studies, and 
drawings in gouache.
The exhibtion will be shown in 
the Hewlett Gallery, Fine Arts 
Building from 8:30 a.m. to 10 
p.m., Monday through Friday, 
8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Saturday, 
and 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., Sun­
day.
European Absence
Mr. Anliker has recently re­
turned from Europe after a two- 
year leave of absence. He was 
there as a result of being award­
ed a fellowship by the John 
Simon Guggenheim Memorial 
Foundation. Under this fellow­
ship, he conducted an investigative 
coastal study of Spain, Portugal, 
France, Italy, and Sicily.
While in Europe, Mr. Anliker 
also did work in Amsterdam, Hol­
land where most of the paintings 
to be shown were completed.
The artist was born in Akron, 
Ohio, in 1924. He attended the 
Cleveland Institute of Art from 
1941 until he entered the Army 
in 1943. He served with the Army 
in France, Germany, and Czecho­
slovakia until 1946.
Bachelor Degree
In 1947 he graduated from the 
Cleveland Institute of Art, and 
received his bachelor of fine arts 
degree from that institution in 
1948. That same year he joined 
the faculty of Carnegie Tech.
Mr. Anliker’s works have been 
widely exhibited. His “Reflection 
on a Willows Theme” (encaustic) 
will be included in this year’s In­
ternational at Carnegie Institute. 
“The Constant Changing” by Mr. 
Anliker was shown in the Insti­
tute’s 1055 International.

partment for the expansion of 
other departments.
Creative Atmosphere Necessary 
Commenting on the need for 
this Center, Norman Rice, Dean 
of Fine Arts, said that new facili­
ties were important to the carry­
ing-out of the grant. “Great 
teachers, in the arts particularly,” 
said Dean Rice, “need an atmos­
phere of creative inquiry, sup­
ported by all the resources which 
education in the arts requires— 
studios, shops, stages, practice and 
performance rooms.”
In a letter informing President 
Warner of the grant, Paul Mellon, 
Chairman of the A. W. Mellon 
Educational and charitable Trust, 
referred to Tech’s program to 
strengthen its entire College of 
Fine Arts as, “an inspiring plan 
for achievement of creative lead­
ership for liberal education in 
the arts.”
“The Trustees,” continued Mr. 
Mellon, “hope that this grant will 
assist the college in further de­
veloping its’ influence in the cul­
tural affairs of the nation and the 
community and that the college 
will attract many other gifts for 
its general endowment and for 
the further strengthening of its 
faculty and student body. In mak­
ing this gift the Trustees have 
not only high hopes but a sound 
basis for great expectations.” 
Expressing appreciation to Mr. 
Mellon and the Trust, President 
Warner called the grant a worthy 
incentive for initiating additional 
educational opportunities and 
community services through the 
Fine Arts. Accenting the latter 
services, he pointed to plans call­
ing for public appearances of the 
eminent scholars attracted to Car­
negie Tech by the grant; a chil­
dren’s training program in the 
Music Department; an Opera 
Workshop; and an expanded pro­
gram of play productions in the 
Drama Department.
Explained President Warner, 
“We have only scratched the sur- 
gace of what we are capable of 
doing when we have the proper 
teaching tools and resources.”

team down the field for another

the ball and Garibaldi punted to 
the Grads on their own one yard 
line.
At this point Dick Hamilton 
caught Cigan in the end zone for a 
safety and the score was Met 
Grads 25 ATO 20. ATO took over 
with two minutes to play and 
scored a first down on the Met 
Grad 10 yard line. A bad pass 
from center cost ATO a 10 yard 
loss and the Met Grads held on 
downs on their own ten yard line. 
They took over and ran the clock 
out gaining a 25 to 22 victory and 
the IM football championship.
