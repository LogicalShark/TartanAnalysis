50 at Spring Carnival 
Qualification Exercises
Will Install New All-

Honorary 
CHOOSE MEMBERS 
FROM UPPER TENTH
Selection to Honorary Based 
Entirely on Scholarship 
And Character
'Fifty seniors were called last 
Saturday to Phi Kappa Phi, 
nc \ all-college national scholastic 
ho . jrary society which will be 
•officially installed 011 the Carnegie 
campus Saturday, June 3. All of 
the students called rank within the 
upper tenth of the graduating 
classes in the College of Indus­
tries, Engineering, Fine Arts, and 
Maragaret Morrison.
Selection to Phi Kappa Phi is 
based entirely upon scholarship 
anu character. The newly-called 
Dneraoers were selected, by the fac­
ulty and administrative staff mem­
bers who constitute the original 
petitioners and charter members 
of the Carnegie chapter.
Membership to Phi Kappa Phi 
c istitutes one of the highest hon­
ors, that can be accorded to a Car- 
negio student for scholastic attain­
ment.
Phi Kappa Phi brings to the 
•campus an all-campus honorary
which will honor outstanding stu­
dents in all departments in the 
school, including both men and 
women.
Director Arthur Crawford Jewett 
of the College of Industries spoke 
before the student body last Satur­
day afternoon during the Call Day 
exercises, on the possibilities and 
advantage of introducing Phi 
Kappa Phi, a new honorary, at
Carnegie.
Phi Kappa Pi was organized 
in 1807 at the University qf
Maine for the purpose of
promoting scholarship among 
.American college students. The 
honorary is not a secret organiza­
tion and is a society rather than 
a | fraternity. It seeks to foster 
. .learning in the life of the under­
graduate by offering him member­
ship on an equal basis with mem­
bers of the faculty.
Through meetings of the faculty 
and the students, it aims to pro­
mote good feeling, learning, and 
high ideals among students in 
their personal college relationships.
Phi Kappa Phi after its founding 
¦at the University of Maine became 
a national organization with the 
admittance of chapters at the Uni­
versity of Tennessee and Pennsyl­
vania State College in 1899 and 
.1900 respectively. It now has a 
membership of 22,500 numbered 
the late Chief Justice William 
Howard Taft, and Associate Jus­
tice Edward T. Sanford of the 
United States Supreme Court, Dr. 
J. C. Branner of Stanford Univer­
sity, President Stratton Brooks of

Alumni Start 
Annual Drive 
For Members
Seniors Urged to Enroll 
Under Special Rates 
Before June 12
GRADUATING CLASS 
INVITED TO DANCE
Encourage Early Enrollment 
By Dues Reduction; 
Chart Shows Progress
The Alumni Association of Car­
negie today launched its fourth an­
nual campaign for alumni member­
ship among the graduating seniors. 
Members of the graduating - class 
from each department will begin 
canvassing their departments for 
the purpose of enrolling every 
senior before commencement.
According to the policy estab­
lished in past years, a special rate 
of $1.50 is offered if the dues are 
paid before June 12; after that date 
the regular rate of $3.00 will be­
come effective. This represents a 
saving of $.50 over the rate offered 
'.ast year. Dues are payable to th€ 
senior agents or at the Alumni 
Office, room 206, in the Gymnasium; 
between the hours of 9 and 12, or 
1 and 5.
On May 2 the members of the 
Alumni Federation Board held a 
dinner for the senior class officers 
of the four colleges, at which plans 
for the drive were discussed. As 
a feature of the campaign, each 
year one of the four .alumni asso­
ciations sponsors a dance for the 
seniors. This year the Industries 
Alumni Association will be hosts 
at a dance, to be held, in Thistle 
Hall, Friday evening, June 21. Ad­
mission will be free for the 
seniors and their guests.
The purpose of the Alumni Fed­
eration is to serve the alumni by 
keeping them in touch with the 
campus. Its members receive the 
“Carnegie Alumnus,” monthly 
¦magazine published as the official 
organ of the association, and the 
Tartan. The Federation also sends

Nearly a score of enthusiastic 
debaters met with Professor Leo 
T. Lawler last week to discuss 
plans for the organization of a de­
bating club. The club will be 
known as the Carnegie Debating 
Union and its membership will be 
selected from among those who 
participate in the Intramural De­
bating Leagues. All who debated 
in the leagues this year are asked 
to be present at the next meeting, 
tomorrow in Room 131-A, Indus­
tries, at 4:30 o’clock.
A committee composed of 
Charles E. Schatvet '33, Paul W. 
Pheneger ’34, and Clifton P. Bou- 
telle ’36 was appointed to draw up 
a constitution and arrange tenta-. 
tive programs for future meetings. 
Arrangements will be mjvde to de­
bate teams from Pitt, Duquesne, 
and other nearby schools. Short 
debates will be held at each of the 
regular meetings.
At the meeting tomorrow, the 
election of officers will take place 
and the new constitution will be 
discussed. A grudge debate, “Re­
solved: That intercollegiate sports 
should be continued in their pres­
ent form,” will be featured at the 
meeting. James S. Hoffman ’34 
and George L. Eppler ’34 of McGill 
Hall will uphold the affirmative. 
R. Murray Kline '33 and Carl F. 
Hanson '33 of Scobell Hall for the 
negative.
Prof. Lawler, who has been in­
strumental in arousing an interest 
in debating on the Carnegie cam­
pus, will act as the adviser and 
critic of the club. He believes 
that the results of the intramural 
debating competition showed that 
many Carnegie students are capa­
ble debaters. Prof. Lawler says 
that there is no reason why Car­
negie should not be represented in 
intercollegiate debating circles.
JUNIOR EDITORS REPORT
New junior editors are to report 
in the Tartan office Thursday at 
11:30 for a short meeting at which 
Ians for the remaining issues of 
a is year and those of next will be 
for.ussed.
Fri
The 1933 summer session will 
open on Monday, June 12, when 
the first classes in Industrial Edu­
cation and Woodworking will be 
held. , The undergraduate work in 
the Colleges of Industries and En­
gineering will begin on June 19, 
the majority of the courses extend­
ing to August 11. The courses In 
Architecture will also begin on 
June 19 but will last only until 
June 28. A special course in draw-- 
ing and design for high school 
students will run from June 26 to

the courses including those in 
Music, Fin© Arts, and the shops 
will begin on June 23 and finish on 
August 4.
Although Professor Robert B. 
Leighou, director: of the summer 
session, will make no prophesies 
as to the probable enrollment, the 
number of inquiries -seems to In­
dicate that, this year’s summer 
session will be as well attended as 
those in the past. Letters from 
such far-away places as the Canal 
Zone, Ontario, and Oregon indicate 
a widespread interest in summer 
school. Over tWo hundred In­
quiries have already been received.
Except for a.few slight modifica­
tions. the 1933 summer session 
will be the same as that of last 
year. The program has been cur­
tailed slightly 'through the elimi­
nation of several of the courses 
which have had the smallest en­
rollments.
Morten J. Luvaas, head of the 
Department of Music at Allegheny 
.College, will be a member of the 
Musical Department staff during 
the summer and will give several 
courses in harmony and choral 
technique. In addition M. Claude 
Rosenberry, Director of Music of 
the State Department of Public

“Distant Drums” Written 
By Totheroh To 
Conclude Season
The Department of Drama will 
conclude its present Little Theater 
season with a major production of 
"Distant Drums” staged by Pro­
fessor Chester Wallace beginning 
Tuesday, May 2S and continuing 
through Memorial Day.
Covered wagons against a back­
ground of Western trails provides 
the setting for a delicate story of 
a woman who is emotionally dis­
tant from her rougher companions. 
The throbbing of Indian drums as 
the red-skinned warriors twist 
about their campfire seems to be 
irresistably joined with the indefi­
nable mission to which she eventu­
ally sacrifices herself.
Dan Totheroh, the author of the 
play, is one of America's younger 
playwrights. Iiis works display a 
wealth of native poetic power and 
imagination. “Distant Drums,” his 
latest play, was produced last 
spring by Guthrie McClintock with 
Pauline Lord playing the lead, and 
has just been released for non-pro­
fessional productions. New York 
critics applauded the production 
and underwrote Mr. Totheroh’s 
strength as a dramatist, but the 
play dkl not have a commercially 
successful run.
Professor Chester Wallace is 
staging the production. The cast 
is as follows: Wolfhill—Robert S. 
Gill; Quincy—Donald J. Gallagher, 
Regis Joyce; Jason—John G. Daw­
son, George A. McCalmpn?'; Pike—

Next Week Will 
Mark Appearance 
Of New Thistle
The 1933 edition of the Thistle, 
which will be issued some time 
next week, bids fair to be one of 
the finest year books Carnegie has 
ever presented. The feature sec­
tion includes an entirely new inno­
vation to be known as the Carnegie 
Crime Club, one of the many sur­
prises this issue has to offer. The 
entire layout has been’designed by 
Bradley Edelblut, junior in the De­
partment of Printing. The art work 
has been under the direction of 
Charles L. Dietz, junior in the De­
partment of Painting and Decorat­
ing.
Division sheets and view sections 
will be on exhibition in the “Y” 
office where orders are being taken. 
Only a limited number will be 
issued, to sell at the price of $4.50. 
In the event that a new edition is 
necessary, the price will go up. 
This year's edition will be entered 
in a nation-wide competition for 
the selection of the finest college 
yearly in the country. This is the 
first time the Thistle has ever 
been entered in this competition, 
which is held annually.
The Thistle staff, under the 
leadership of Edward M. Rhodes, 
editor-in-chief, has been agitating 
for a condition whereby two dol­
lars from the activities fee be 
allotted to the support of the 
Thistle. In this way, Carnegie 
would be able to produce a bigger, 
more superb book and there would 
be no need for assessments. The 
Student Council has shown a fav­
orable attitude to the suggestion, 
but the Executive Board has tabled 
it for the present.
Booklet With Vieivs 
Of Campus Published
A booklet of Campus Views, 
printed by the Carnegie Institute 
press was issued yesterday. The 
booklet contains a description of 
the four colleges and seventy-five 
pictures, which include external 
views of the campus, students at 
work, and scenes of the student 
activities. Since the booklet was 
prepared as a gujde for high school 
students planning to enter Carne­
gie, high school teachers are in­
vited to obtain copies for their 
classes. By writing to the office of 
the Registrar those interested in 
the work at Carnegie may obtain a 
copy of this book.

Fraternities Give Opinions 
On Abolishing “Hell Week”
Recent Survey Shows That Many Organizations 
Favor Mild Informal Initiations While 
Others Voice Different Opinions
By WILLIAM
Hell Week, the period of initia­
tion preceding the formal induc­
tion of pledges into the social fra­
ternities, has been undergoing a 
rapid change at Carnegie campus 
during the last few years. Pre­
viously, it was .common practice 
among the fraternities to conduct 
their initiations with a strict ad­
herence to all that the name “Hell 
Week” might imply. Stretching 
through a period of one week, the 
calibre of a pledge was determined 
by his capacity to take punishment 
unflinchingly. The opinion then 
existing wfas' that by subjecting the 
candidate for membership to a se­
vere initiation his value as a future 
member would be considerably in­
creased.
In a recent survey of the con­
ditions now existing concerning 
Hell Week, heads of the various 
houses have disclosed ideas on the 
subject which, in most cases, show 
a definite change in attitude. In 
two cases national rulings have 
abolished Hell Week and in a few 
other instances attempts are being 
made through the national organi­
zations to do away with it. In all 
other cases it was discovered that 
national organizations had no rul­
ings concerning the conducting of 
initiations at the various chapters, 
although it is generally understood 
that they favor milder, shorter
LANDSBERG
periods of initiation. Local chap­
ters, in using their own discretion 
in the matter, for the most part 
show a tendency to incline In the 
same direction by expressing a de­
sire to shorten the amount of time 
for Hell Week and to minimize the 
amount of physical infliction. Two 
fraternities which have no national 
rulings to that effect, have, of their 
own volition, abolished Hell Week, 
retaining only the formal initiation 
with a few pre-initiation duties.
On the other hand, several 
groups have • expressed the belief 
that a period of initiation should 
Tie a thorough test of the morale 
and sportsmanship of a pledge. 
They contend that this can only be

Phi Nu To Hold 
Reunion Saturday
Phi Nu, night school fraternity, 
will hold its first annual reunion 
May 20 at 6:30 p. m. in the Vene­
tian Room, Webster Hall, Dr. Ros- 
coe M. Ihrig-5 director of night 
courses, will be taken into the fra­
ternity as an honorary member. 
Dr. Thomas S. Baker will be the 
honored guest of the evening.
Phi Nu fraternity was organized 
December 12, 1916 yhen six night 
school students decided that a fra­
ternity for the night students 
would be desirable. With this in 
mind, these students organized 
“Klanickt” (meaning Night Klan). 
On December 26, 1921, they changed 
the name, “Klanickt,” to Phi Nu 
fraternity. This same evening, the 
first honorary member, Professor 
George H. Follows, was taken into 
the fraternity.
After the world war, Phi Nu, 
working with other night students 
took steps toward the organization 
of the night student body. A com­
mittee met with the faculty and 
discussed this proposed organiza­
tion and subsequently a constitu­
tion was submitted for approval of 
the authorities. The banding to­
gether of the night school students 
finally culminated in the formation 
of the Night Student Council.
Igor Karassik and William Jus- 
ice, graduate student in the De­
partment of Mechanical Engineer­
ing, last veek completed their ex­
periments and thesis on the rela­
tion of automobile streamlining to 
the reduction of wind resistance. 
The two students proved beyond a 
doubt that the water channel 
method can be used successfully 
to investigate the various types 
of flow problems.
The research consisted largely 
of observing the movements of 
various-shaped miniature automo­
biles in a water channel. In this 
channel a three-inch wooden model 
of a car was propelled by electric 
power and its movements recorded 
by a. camera suspended, above it. 
In order to observe the water cur­
rents, a small quantity of Lycopo- 
dium powder which readily formed 
a film over the water’s surface 
was sprinkled in the channel. The 
power ' ‘/as applied and tlle auto 
sailed through the water, Its speed 
being determined by a regulatory 
scale. As it traveled the camera 
clicked and a photograph was 
made. The camera caught not the 
speed of the car but the positions 
of the fine particles of powder 
which were broken by the auto­
mobile's speed.
From the photographs and the 
speed which registered on the 
control scale, tlio students cal­
culated the effect of wind resis- 
ance on different types of stream­
line obstructions. It is from the 
conclusions based on these fig­
ures that their thesis has been 
large compiled. The thesis 
will be approved by the profes­
sors of Department of Mechanical 
Engineering in order that the stu­
dents may obtain their master de­
gree.

Are Recipients 
Of Scholarships
Harold F. Neff ’¡}4, ai(d Robert I-I. 
Seitz '35, students in the Depart­
ment of Electrical Engineering, 
have been awarded the Alexander 
Jay Wurts Memorial Scholarships 
which were established last year 
in memory of ProTessor Wurts by 
his widow, Elizabeth R. Wurts.
Professor Wurts was the first 
member appointed to the Carnegie 
Technical Schools’ teaching staff. 
He remained with the institution 
for twenty-live years as professor 
and head of the Department of 
Electrical Engineering and in re­
cent years as chairman of the Stu­
dent Welfare Committee.
By his untimely death last Janu­
ary, Carnegie was robbed of a 
precious friend. Inventor and co­
worker with George Westingliouse, 
Mr. Wurts helped the students by 
means of the Student Welfare 
fund. Established in 1925 through 
Mr. Wurts’ own generosity, this 
fund applies to all students and 
consists of an outright gift, al­
though the student benefited may 
return the amount when able.
In order to offer a fitting memo­
rial for her husband, Mrs. Wurts 
donated several shares of MacBeth- 
Evans Glass Company stock to es­
tablish the Alexander Jay Wurts 
Memorial Scholarship to be award­
ed to a senior in electrical engineer­
ing who is recommended by the 
head of his department. The schol­
arship yields an annual income of 
$300. In the event in any year the 
excess income reaches $150, it shall 
be awarded under the same condi­
tions to a junior.

matches, picking up an extra haif 
point when McKenzie and Grow 
split all even in their twosome.
Joel Haverstick, number one 
man for Tech, met his Jonah again 
in the form of Hoblitzell of West 
Virginia and went down 7 and 5 
under the onslaught of the Moun­
taineer ace. Red Fergus of the 
Tartans lost to Lowes, 4 and 3, in 
spite of the fact that he had the 
second low medal score of the day. 
Fergus has been shooting good, 
consistent golf all year, but has 
had enough bad breaks to keep him 
from winning any one of his 
matches to date. Hamilton of 
West Virginia turned back Ed 
Reese one up, in a hotly contested 
match. Aspinol of the Mountain­
eers took'Burgoyne, 3 and 2, after 
a hard battle for sixteen hol?s.
Kay, Tech’s only undefeated 
golfer, won again, beating Manning 
1 up on the nineteenth. The 
Skibo lad has gone through six 
matches, singles and doubles, with­
out an upset. He looks good for 
an undefeated season and next 
year should be a top notcher on 
the Tech squad.
In the foursomes Hoblitzell and 
Lowes of West Virginia took 
Fergus and Haverstick, 4 and 3. 
These two are the Mountaineers 
best and work well together, but 
the Tartans put up a stiff battle 
against the Morgantown lads. 
Grow and Aspinal defeated Bur- 
goyne and McKenzie 3 and 2 in a 
close match. Reese and Kay re­
peated their previous victory turn­
ing back Hamilton and Manning, 
1 up.

West Virginia Golfers 
Take Revenge For 
Previous Loss
West Virginia brought the Tech 
golfers to their first defeat of the 
season last Saturday by taking 
them 6% to 2% at the Pittsburgh 
Field Club. The Morgantown boys 
boast of one of the strongest stick 
aggregations in the district and, 
after last week’s defeat at the 
hands of the Skibos, were out for 
blood. Playing was slowed up by 
wet grounds and a drizzling rain 
which raised the medal scores or 
both teams. Lowes of West Vir­
ginia recorded the lowest card of 
the day with an even 80. Fergus 
and Hoblitzell each turned in 83’s 
for second low.

singles and two of the double

IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE GOOD DOCTOR—Doc Mark« to thooc 
trying to get an cxcusc for a missed quiz—was singularly honored last 
Friday by a number of hie more ardent wcll-wlshcrs. The presenta­
tion, too, came at a moment when a little encouragement might help a 
lot, for it occmr, that at the time there were two out and that the sacks 
were polluted. With a blare of trumpets and with the colors of Old 
Glory, borne by Messrs. Leonard and Stewart (two members of the 
rowdier clement of this campus), flying in the breeze, Fritz stepped up 
to the plate and presented the Schenley Park favorite with a beautiful 
bouquet of something or other. My knowledge of botany is limited or 
I would tell you what kind of flowers they were. At any rate, tears 
and a faint blush came over Doc's pan, and he was so overwhelmed by 
this token of friendship that he proceeded to double into left center. 
Incidontly, the faculty bumped off the seniors, 18-17.

A FAMOUS GREEK 
BOOTLEGGER.The faculty proved that they 
were just a little too classy for 
Jimmy Fergus and his band of 
senior mushballers. Of course the 
faculty were given at least five outs 
every inning, but it still stands 
that they paid off to the tune of 
18-17, in spite of several protests to 
the effect that the senior's pitcher 
wasn’t bearing down the way he 
should in certain instances.
All of this seems to be so much 
sour grapes, for the faculty'looked 
particularly good in spite of the 
fact that they were pitted against
After two weeks of almost com­
plete track inactivity the Tartans 
will get back into swing with tradi­
tional /-est in their meet with Pitt 
this afternoon, weather and track 
permitting. This week, with the 
Pitt meet this afternoon and a 
Journey to Philadelphia to meet 
Temple 011 Saturday, is by sched­
ule the most difficult of the season, 
and it is regretable that a fort­
night of inactivity should of ne­
cessity be the preparation for such 
a test. -
The Pitt team defeated Temple 
in its opening meet, but was de­
feated barely by West Virginia, 
68-67, and they lost to Penn State 
last Saturday. The Panthers, 
however, are expecting to make 
their place in the win column to­
day, and they will probably do so 
mainly because of their numerical 
superiority over the Tartans.
Should Captain Coulter choose to 
run the 440 against Bill Keller he 
will meet in the latter one of the 
classiest middle distance steppers 
in this district. Keller is capable 
of executing the 440 in 49 and the 
880 in 1:58, and ho has won both 
of these events in each of the 
three meets Pitt has had thus far.
The Panthers boast a clever lit­
tle sprinter and broad jumper, 
Fleming, and a great pair of two 
milerB, Clise and Albright. But 
the strength of their team lies 
mostly In the field events, especial­
ly in the shot, broad jump, and 
pole vault. Bonavita, Valenti, and 
Gongloff are excellent ball and plate 
tossers, and Sebastian, of •gridiron 
fame, does well in the broad jump.
TRY to forgive him. Poor chap, 
he really means well, even if he 
does think his posterity is the thing 
he sits on!
If you’re really sorry for Bill Boner, 
give him a pipe and some good to­
bacco. That will straighten him out 
—for a pipe filled with Edgeworth 
Smoking Tobacco clears the brain 
for straight thinking. As you know, 
Edgeworth was proved by a recent 
investigation to be the favorite smok­

ALTHOUGH THE FACULTY TJONNIS MATCH was rained out, that 
annual classic, the Interfraternity. Sweepstakes, came off in grand 
style, thus making the Spring Carnival a success as far as athletic 
events go. The Betas copped the mug again, and the design trophy 
went to the Theta Xls for the umpsteenth consecutive time. In win­
ning the speed trophy, the Betas again broke their own record for the 
course. In 1030, they set a record of three minutes fiat, and last year 
they lowered the time for the circuit to 2:54. Saturday they completed 
the grind in the remarkable time of 2:48. The fact that the times 
are constantly becoming faster seems to prove that the fraternities 
are really taking this event seriously and are making the going tougher 
every year. Faster buggies and better conditioned athletes are the 
answer.

such luminaries as Vic Mathis,

Bronson, Bobbie Smith, and many 
others.
The faculty themselves had no 
mean bunch of base runners. Such 
fading stars as Fryer, Gustafson, 
Gregg, Lawler, and Doc Marks 
were very much in* the ball game. 
Doc Marks was presented with a 
bouquet from his admirers at one 
trip to the plate. At his other at­
tempts he received large ovations 
of cheers—plain and Bronx mixed, 
and as a whole he performed cred­
itably in the field.
The tennis match between the 
faculty and the seniors had to be 
called off on account of wet 
courts, but the faculty insisted that 
this was just a lucky break for the 
seniors.
Howdy O'Dell, also of pigskin fame, 
tops the vaulting bar at about 11% 
feet quite regularly and has prom­
ise of greater heights.
Temple, after losing to Pitt, 
rallied to hand the City College of 
New York a sound lacing, but ex­
perienced a relapse last week 
against Villa Nova. The Temple- 
ites seem somewhat stronger than 
they were when they shook the 
Plaid for a loss last year at their 
first meet with each other.
MR. JAMES CAMPBELL FERGUS CAME INTO THE GYM on Call 
Day with a face longer than that of a Republican ex-congressman. On 
making Inquiries, it was found that "Red” had just lost his third golf 
match in a row. Well, cheer up, Red; the hole isn't as big as a basket­
ball loop, you know.
THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED GAMES IN THE INTRAMURAL 
MUSHBALL leagues should come to a conclusion this week, unless J. 
Pluvius intends to make life miserable for the entire month. At this 
stage of the game, it looks as if the Theta Xis, the Rlio Dammit Rhos, 
the Betas, and the Kappa Slgs are headed for the playoffs, but upsets 
have been known to happen in this grand old game. For all-around 
strength, including pitching, batting strength, and consistent fielding, 
the Rlio Dams seems to have a healthy edge 011. their rivals, but the 
Kappa Sigs have a phenomenal battery in Jagnow and Smith, and the 
Betas swear by war clubs of Fergus and Cllsbee, so it looks like a 
number of reaL battles in the finals.
SOME FORTY-EIGHT YOUNG ATHLETES ARE GLAD that how it’s 
all over. Spring football drills came to an end a week ago Saturday, 
and whether or not that three weeks of hard work has been of any 
avail will be proved next fall when they take on the hardest schedule 
in the history of the school.
IN 1931 EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT THE ULTIMATE IN HARD 
SCHEDULES had been reached, for the Tartan warriors played 
Georgia Tech, Purdue, Notre Dame, Pitt, and Temple 011 consecutive 
Saturdays, not to mention the engagements with Wash-Jeff and N. 
Y. U. This year they play almost the same teams with a few extra 
major games thrown in for good measure. To open the hostilities 
Mr. Overend has arranged for Pop Warner to bring his new charge, 
Temple, to the Iron City, and the Philadelphians have never been re­
garded as setups in any league. Two weeks later, the Iiarpster cohorts 
<angle with the Green Ramblers from Notre Dame in an attempt to 
take the bad taste out. of their mouths from the 1982 debacle. This 
classic will bo followed by battles with W. & J., Georgetown, Purdue, 
Michigan State, Now York U., and Pitt.
THE PITT GAME, INCIDENTALLY, HAS BEEN DATED FOR 
THANKSGIVING this yenr. This will be good news to those living in 
town or to thone who will stay In town anyhow, but those going home 
for the holldnyt; will probably gripe rather loudly at their misfortune. 
A traditional battle, such nn the Pitt-Carnegle game, however, should 
be the concluding battle on the schedule of both teams, for under the 
present system the last couple of games act as a sort of anti-climax 
that results In the players and their supporter« losing their enthu­
siasm. Thr Pitt-Stanford and the Carnegle-N. Y. U. games were both 
examples of this. _________
The college man likes that distinc­
tive flavor that comes only from this 
blend of fine old burleys. It’s differ­
ent. It’s a soothing, relaxing sort of 
smoke that makes the job in hand 
just a little easier.

Without, a doubt it was one of the 
finest things we’ve seen anywhere 
and it was unquestionably one of 
the highspots of the evening.
The skits, taken as a whole, 
were not on a par with those of 
the 1932 edition. Some exhibited 
satirical cleverness: others only
amusing clumsiness when an at­
tempt was made to introduce nov­
elty into a skit whose conclusion 
was self evident from the very 
first line. “Pride and Prejudice," 
the Barrymore number, and "Valley 
Forgery” probably should head the 
list in this department, with 
"Bubchen in Uniform" included 
mainly because of George MeCal- 
mon’s ability as the quarterback.
Added catchiness characterized 
this year’s ' music. There was. 
however, a disturbing similarity of 
type evident in the compositions 
used which might not have been so 
noticeable if less uniformity of 
treatment had existed in the 
orchestrations. Individually, the

By ROY MINET
List Friday escaped being the 
13th by only 24 hours, yet it was a 
day jammed with electrical im­
portance for the Bacchanalians 
who faced the opening of their 
most ambitious production, “Over 
the Coals," at the Pitt Theater.
“Over the Coals” lacked the 
pleasant intimacy of last year’s 
“Tar and Feathers." Taking an af­
fair off the campus that is as essen­
tially a student affair as is the 
Spring Carnival revue imposed 
serious disadvantages upon the 
show itself. Not only must such an 
action have incurred a large 
amount of additional difficulties, 
but it destroyed much of the pro­
duction's charm through the super­
imposition of so foreign an atmos­
phere. The reason is that the 
spectator was led to make uninten­
tional comparisons to professional 
productions. This sort of associa­
tion is inevitably unfair, and usu­
ally unfavorable to student-written 
and student-produced entertain­
ments.
Taking last year’s revue as our 
only standard, the first thing no­
ticeable about "Over the Coals.” 
if the pathetically inadequate light­
ing is ignored, was the excellence 
of the dancing. Bill Bales devel­
oped a chorus capable of perform­
ing unusually intricate routines 
with an uncommon degree of pro­
ficiency. His own performance, 
both in his tap specialty and in his 
bare-footed “Monotony" number, 
eclipsed anything in “Tar and 
Frathers.” Special mention is de­
ceived by the “Noctourne for Har­
lequin” staged by Vernon Crane.
songs were quite attractive, though 
some suffered a great deal from 
indistinct enunciation, and others 
from awkward staging. “Tawdry 
Tow” illustrates the first case, and 
"Cross My Heart, Dear," the sec­
ond.
Innovations and experiments 
seemed lo be more in evidence this 
year. Some were good: some de­
feated their own purpose. Both 
the opening and the finale, while 
novel, were extremely weak. To 
be completely successful, a show 
such as MOver the Coals” requires 
not only novelty, but novelty plus 
punch to give unity and (low to the 
production.
William Beal and Herman Live- 
right, who occupied the directorial 
chairs, established a standard of 
sequential continuity far above 
that of their previous effort. "Over 
the Coals" could have been much 
improved, however, by stepping-up 
the tempo. The lagging impression 
created was aggravated by the flat 
conclusions to some of the num­
bers. This was especially evident 
in the staging of a few of the 
songs,- and in the use of the orches­
tra. The poor control of the light­
ing, probably more than any other 
one thing, broke the smoothness 
of the production. With the elim­
ination next year of the weak­
nesses discovered in the show just 
past, the Bacchanalian banner 
should move into the forefront of 
Carnegie traditions—with the res­
ervation that it be kept a campus 
affair with less pretentions and 
more emphasis upon inter-depart­
mental participation.

When it rains, it pours—no, I 
don't mean what you are thinking 
about—Did you ever see anything 
like the amount of moisture we are 
having? Looked as if the Spring 
C~rnival Committee got a tip from 
the “water man," because they 
have arranged that all the big 
events will take place under cover, 
except the “qualification exercises" 
and even these are scheduled to 
take place in the gym if the 
weather becomes wet—Oh that IF.
Annual Fencing 
Exhibition Given 
Tonight In GymWith all the doings of this week­
end. for both the night students 
and the day students, I mean so­
cially, T was wondering whether 
there would be an issue of the Tar­
tan. Much lo my surprise I saw a 
notice that there would be makeup 
(drama students beware) on Fri­
day morning. Now this struck me 
very funny, being a night student, 
and an idle one at that, I hardly 
knew how to interpret the notice.
THE MODERN MODEStudents of Mr. Gfeorge W. Post­
gate, instructor in fencing, will give 
their annual Fencing Exhibition 
this evening at 8:00 o’clock in the 
Men’s Gymnasium. The program 
includes: Single Sticks. Old
fashioned saber, Foil Lesson, Foil 
Fencing (old style). Duelling 
sword, New style foil fencing, and 
Modern saber (cut and thrust).
Fencing is one of the few sports 
that can be indulged in by the 
young and old. Attending the last 
Olympics was a New Yorker, 78 
years old, who fences three times 
each week at the New York Athle­
tic Club.
The history ot' fencing is the 
history of the art of attack and de­
fense. Probably the first weapon 
used by man was some kind of a 
ciub. Later primitive man develop­
ed a long stout pole of heavy wood 
similar to the old fashioned quarter 
staff. Next a shorter and more 
handy weapon, now called the 
single stick, was invented, from 
which was derived the cane or 
walking stick. Some time after the 
fall of Rome, where short swords 
were used, the noblemen fought 
with cutting swords, then cut and 
thust weavons, and finally the duel­
ling sword. The single stick is 
now used as a practice weapon for 
the old fashioned saber.

whether Fritz has lost some of the 
valuable ground where he tends 
his flock—yes, the yellow flowers

Determined not to be outdone by

Mr. Orbin calls upon the "Civils”

IN A PADDED CELL
RESEARCH moves in devious ways its 
wonders to perform. G.E. has a padded cell 
in its general engineering laboratory—for the 
isolation of extraneous sounds. Confined in it, 
at intervals, is equipment which serves best 
when heard least. The cell is a room within 
a room. The outer wall is of sound-absorbing 
plaster; then come hollow tile, air space, felt, 
another layer of plaster, more air space, sheet 
iron, air space, lathwork, and a thick layer of 
cotton waste. Total thickness, a foot and a 
half. Within the chamber a “noise meter” 
tracks down outlawed decibels.
Last year, the noise meter left its cell and 
traveled to Manhattan’s Metropolitan Opera 
House. Ensconsed in a grand tier box, it 
measured voices, orchestra, and applauding 
hands while “Rigoletto” was sung. The meter 
discovered that Beniamino Gigli registered 77 
decibels—a street car makes only 65. Labo­
ratory devices do have their big moments.
FORE!
“ IV 7'OW! What a drive! Wish I could hit 
W ’em like that.” Just a few comments as 
a national driving champ smacked a golf ball 
out of sight. Occasion—the demonstration of 
a new G-E device for measuring speeds here­
tofore not measurable because of their nature. 
The apparatus registered the speed of the 
champ’s club head at 125 miles per hour, an 
average player is lucky to register 70. No 
wonder the champion can hit them so far.
Just back of the balL two parallel beams of 
light are at right angles to the path of the club 
head. Each beam hits an “electric eye” or 
photoelectric tube. A split second before 
striking the ball, the driver cuts the first 
beam, and almost immediately afterwards 
cuts the .second beam. Both phototubes 
operate Thyratron tubes, the first one causing 
a condenser to begin charging and the second 
one stopping it The charge is measured by a

The Baton Has Been Passed
Another Tartan year lias ended...the lust for the senior
members oi: the stuff. With this issue tlie reins are handed to 
the new stuff Jieuds; this issue has been edited by the new stuff.
The retiring stuff reluctantly pusses on. The yeurs spent 
5n Turtun work huve been interesting, instructive, und enter­
taining, but,the inevitable boot oJ: time tramples down the'old 
grass so thut the new muy grow, und we must cleur our desks 
and empty our drawers to make room for new people with new 
ideas.
It hus been the endeavor of this year’s staff to set new pre­
cedents, to do something different.. AVe have strived to edit 
and publish a paper thut would be truly representutive oi! the 
student body (ii! such a representation is possible by a publica­
tion). AVe have aimed to present ull sides of contraVersul mat­
ters and to take stands only on questions which demanded 
frank opinion and fair judgment for the benefit of the entire 
student body. Humian beings are not infallible;-we have left 
much undone. How successful we have been must be deter­
mined by our readers.
The exiting members hope that the new staff will take up 
what we have left unfinished and continually strive to make 
improvements.
The baton has passed.
THE RETIRING STAFF.
“Hell Week"
The period of rough initiation preceding the formal initia­
tion of social fraternities has been for several years the subject 
of serious discussion at Carnegie. .Ijast year definite action was 
taken on the topic when a motion was made by the Interfrater­
nity Council, and passed and put into effect this year, that 
“Hell Week” take place at approximately the same time at all 
houses.
At the last meeting of the Council another'step toward the 
solution of the problem was taken when a proposal was made 
and tabled pending investigation, that “Hell Week” be drop­
ped entirely and that the pledges be subjected only to a formal 
initia lion.
The Tartan, interested in the question, has made a -brief 
impartial survey of the attitudes of the various fraternities on 
the subjeel:. The survey disclosed that some houses feel that 
the rough initiation period is not harmful to the pledge but 
rather brings forth his true qualities and makes membership 
mean more to him. Other houses believe that “Hell Week” is a 
period of unnecessary torture to pledges who are burdened 
with heavy schedules and must keep up in their school work.
.Although no definite conclusions are drawn, the attitudes 
of the fraternities seem to. point to a shorter period of initiation, 
and oven toward total elimination of the so-called “Hell 
Week,” The Turtun is interested in hearing the opinions of the 
students on the topic.
“Over the Coals”
The Hueclumuliuns are lo be congratulated for their fine 
performance last Friday and Saturday evenings. Working for 
many months, cramming rehearsals between classes and spend­
ing many nights working late, it is to their credit that: they 
produced a show of such a high caliber as “Over the Coals.” 
Wo hope that they will continue their splendid work and that 
their shows become one of Carnegie’s traditions.

Congratulations for your edito­
rial and letters printed lately re­
garding the WAR AGAINST WAlt. 
They are very encouraging to all 
pacifists and peace lovers who will 
not admit that they are such, es­
pecially as so many of the articles 
are either impartial or pacilistic 
rather than strongly militaristic, 
as so much newspaper writing is 
today.
Although everyone admits that 
most nations are uot yet safe from 
the threat, of war, we, in progres­
sive and enlightened America, 
should take advantage' of our po­
sition as a leading world power 
the most free from attack to con­
tinue our leadership by insisting 
upon immediate reduction by all 
nations, of the world of at least 
one-third of all1 armaments. Wo 
can be proud of the aggressiveness 
of our representatives who are 
even now demanding armament 
reduction or Europe. Rut. our gov­
ernment dnrep go only as fast and 
a« far as public oplniop allows it. 
It is our patriotic duty, not. to call 
for war, but to buck our officials 
who are endeavoring to make this 
a safer and happier world in which 
to live.
Wo can aocelerato peace per­
manency by supporting peace or­
ganization», lectures, discussions, 
literature, and pledges which 
strive for world'peace in unsolllsb 
ways. These must reach Urn rich 
and poor, the scholar and the Illiter­
ate masses in language and dra­
matization which all must under­
stand to cope with and break down 
the selfish, short-sighted, and rid­
iculed arguments and hateful 
propaganda circulated so widely by 
militarists and nationalists. Peace 
groups create world friendships 
and co-operation instead of suspi­
cion and jealousy which the mili­
tarists think will always continue 
as in the past. Only pessimists 
can not see progress in world 
peace during the last decade. More 
progress has been made since the 
war than in the previous century 
for world peaec.
Many aggressive radical as well 
as conservative organizations all
over the world are ardently work­
ing for lasting peace. Some of 
these in the United States include:
The National Council for Pre­
vention of War.
Fellowship of Reconciliation.
New History Society.
The Green International.
War Resisters’ League.
Women's Peace Union.
W. C. T. U.
Peace Patriots.
The Committee on Militarism in 
Education.
Among the good books dealing 
with various phases of peace and 
war from the angle of progressive 
and unselfish pacifism are Kirby 
Page’s “National Defense/’ Devere 
Allen’s “Fight for Peace,” and 
Florence Boekel’s “Facts and Fig­
ures on International Affairs.”
Over 5,04)0 citizens, many of 
them youths between eighteen and 
thirty years of age, in the United 
States have joined the War Resist­
ers’ League alone, which has 
pledge for militant pacificts: ‘‘War 
is U crime against humanity. 1 
therefore am determined not to 
support ANY kind of war, interna­
tional or civil, and to strive for 
the removal of all causes of war.” 
Soon this, organization and others 
will make themselves felt nation­
ally, and our politicians and mil­
lionaires will not he so ready to 
declare war with our youth as the 
camion fodder. “Wars will cease 
when men refuse to tight."
Present Carnegie students be­
lting to the War Resistors' League 
and others will Join when they 
realize Its slgnlticnnee. One In­
stitution at Carnegie must event­
ually go and the sooner the hotter. 
That Is the Reserve Ofllcors' Train­
ing Corps.
Yours for peace.

Fraternities Expound 
Ideas on “Hell Week”
Continued From Pn^o l
accomplished by a fairly strenuous 
initiation. By applying severe 
methods for this short period they 
are of the opinion that a stronger 
bond is created between the future 
members and the fraternity and 
that a new member can honestly 
feel that he has deservlngly won 
the right to wear the badge of the 
fraternity he has selected.
A good many fraternities show a 
definitely favorable attitude toward 
Hell Week but put stress on the 
fact that none of the activities dur­
ing that period should infringe 
upon the school work of the indi­
vidual.
On the whole, the large majority 
have expressed the, opinion that 
although they consider Hell Week 
essential and Indispensable to the 
welfare of future members, they

English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
To exaggerate—a word which is 
derived from the Latin exaggerare 
meaning to heap up, and which cur­
rently conveys the idea of enlarg­
ing beyond bounds or the truth— 
is a common enough human charac­
teristic. The practice seems to en­
hance individual self-importapce or 
egotism. A vivid and lively imag­
ination may make a simple deed 
swell to proportions that tax be 
lief, causing one in sheer surprise 
to question and to be answered with 
“was you there?" The telling of 
tall tales becomes a literary vogue 
it is a means of characterization. 
Romance and wonder literature re 
place realism and fact. Naturally 
enough fact must appear to give 
the whole verisimilitude, but 
myth and miracle create Interest 
and enthusiasm.
This enlarging on the truth has 
also a rhetonial and philological 
interest for the student of lan­
guage. In this connection let us 
consider the figure of speech called 
hyperbole. The word is derived 
from a Greek form meaning “an 
overshooting;” and it expresses 
an evident exaggeration. Its use 
may be illustrated by the story told 
of a young lady from the Middle 
West who said, in describing some 
matters incidental to her vacation, 
that she "simply died from the 
heat,” was “tickled to‘ death by 
the movie comedians,” was "driven 
crazy by traffic congestion,” and 
was “frozen still' while sight-seeing 
on a ‘rubber-neck’ wagon. In a 
similar hyperbolical way,entertain­
ing public speakers are alter­
nately greeted with “roars of 
laughter” and “thunders of ap­
plause.”
The practice, too, extends to in­
dividual words, many of which 
were probably coined without much 
regard for the truth but which are 
retained without all of their orig­
inal emphasis. Let us consider, 
for example, the word “astonish." 
It now means “to strike with sud­
den fear, wonder, or surprise,” but 
it does not convey entirely the idea 
of its Latin derivatives which 
meant “to thunder out." The collo­
quial "bleacher,” meaning “a roof­
less seat for spectators at outdoor 
games,” has admost lost is original 
sense. It comes to use from the 
Anglo-Saxon "blaecon” which 
meant "to grow pale” or "to 
“blanch.” Though the habit of 
‘growing pale” might have per­
sisted among the medieval femin­
ine “bleacherites” while they were 
watching a bloody tournament in 
the interest of chivalry, or a sav­
age spectacle of bear-bating, such 
as the Elizabethan enjoyed. One 
could hardly maintain that ah ex­
posed seat at one of our modern 
sport spectacles would be condu­
cive to "paling the countentance” 
of its occupant.

Open Y MCA Schools 
For Unemployed Men
Two branches ot the Pittsburgh 
Young Men’s Christian Association 
served 617 different individuals 
with organized leisure time 
schools during the past winter, ac­
cording to -Henry Russell Miller, 
attorney and author, who reviews 
the record as chairman of the edu­
cational committee at the Down­
town branch.
These young men came from 
many points in Allegheny county, 
the only requirements for qualifi­
cation being that they were unem­
ployed and financially unable to at­
tend a school where a charge was 
made. Classes were taught three 
days each week by 48 certified 
teachers who donated their serv­
ices, the Downtown curriculum 
containing 31 courses while the 
East Liberty branch offered 22.
According to Miller, the problem 
was primarily a social one. Three- 
fourtlis of the registered students 
were from IS to 22.

in Phi Kappa Phi, a student must 
have finished at least three years 
of a regular four-year course lead­
ing to a bachelors degree or higher 
and must place within the upp*er

lack of eligible students caused 
by the transference of three de­
partments from the College of In­

pa Phi will not add to the number 
of honoraries at Carnegie.
A feature of the new honorary 
will.be the fact that "all Its officers

president, must be faculty mem­

Yes, I have heard about two

Why do these two words 
"they satisfy” fit Chester­

Cigarettes are milder. Be­
cause Chesterfield Cigarettes
