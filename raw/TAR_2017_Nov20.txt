Carnegie Mellon researchers combat partisan gerrymandering
Carnegie Mellon’s student newspaper since 1906
Chalabi discusses her work to engage readers through data
NORA MATTSON
Assistant News Editor
We have a tendency to 
think of data as concrete, 
as being something that 
communicates some kind 
of exact and empirical 
truth, just because we have 
found a way to quantify the 
world around us. However, 
communicating the un-
certainties that come with 
every dataset is one of the 
challenges that purveyors 
of data journalism face to-
day. Mona Chalabi, Data 
Editor for The Guardian 
US, has found one way to 
convey this uncertainty: 
with illustrations that 
allow people to both 
connect and engage with 
data, but also to not overly 
state its precision.
In a talk last Sunday 
at the Carnegie Library of 
Pittsburgh, Chalabi out-
lined her process when 
it comes to presenting is-
sues through data. This 
talk was one of the many 
events centered around 
data and its usage hosted 
by the Carnegie Library 
over the past months.
The Department of 
Statistics and Data Science 
at the Dietrich College of 
Humanities and Social 
Sciences is one of the fast-
est growing departments 
at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity, with the number 
of undergraduate statistics 
majors being more than 20 
times what it was in 2003. 
This uptick was attributed 
to the fact that the depart-
ment focuses on “problems 
that are real,” as stated by 
Professor Rebecca Nugent, 
director of undergraduate 
studies.
These “real problems” 
are Mona Chalabi’s job. She 
began her talk by talking 
about the myriad issues 
she had covered during 
her work as a journalist, 
bringing up that “which-
ever of those issues you 
care about, and hopefully 
you care about at least one 
of them, with both data 
and design skills you can 
try to make sure that other 
people care about those is-
sues too.” She outlined the 
capacity for data visual-
izations to engage people 
with different viewpoints, 
hoping that when the talk 
was over “that whatever it 
is that you are interested 
in, you leave with a bit of 
insight into how to com-
municate your knowledge 
to other people, maybe 
even people that are total-
ly different to you.”
She also cited spreading 
knowledge about statistics 
and data usage as part of 
the mission of her journal-
ism, hoping that her re-
porting will leave readers 
empowered to fact check. 
She states, “When you read 
something, it’s okay to feel 
skeptical.” However, she 
also emphasized that “it’s 
important to channel that 
skepticism into action and 
test this stuff for yourself. 
And in order to do that, 
it’s important that as many 
citizens as possible have 
these skills to be able to do 
that research.”
This commitment to 
careful and ethical data 
usage lends transparency 
and another layer to her 
work. “Mona commits to 
transparency at every step 
along the way by sharing 
her sources, collaborat-
ing with her followers 
through live streams and 
comments, and editing 
her art based on feedback.

In the United States, 
as one of the ?rst coun-
tries founded on the basis 
of democratically electing 
government of?cials, the 
practice of gerrymandering, 
de?ned as drawing election 
districts in a way that favors 
one political party over an-
other, is almost as old as the 
country itself, starting with 
some of the ?rst elections 
in this country. In 1788, 
Patrick Henry and his Anti-
Federalist allies tried to 
draw districts in such a way 
to keep James Madison out 
of the U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives, although they 
were unsuccessful.
More recently, the GOP 
has increasingly been criti-
cized for using sophisticated 
algorithms to draw districts 
in such a way that heavily 
favors their own party, using 
methods such as packing 
minority voters (who tend 
to vote Democratic) in as 
few districts as possible, or 
splitting opponents’ vot-
ers into as many districts as 
possible so the opponents 
are in the minority. Cur-
rently, the Supreme Court 
is in the midst of a case 
related to Wisconsin’s re-
districting practices that 
some have criticized as 
unconstitutional.
In order to alleviate 
this problem, some states 
have hired independent 
commissions to draw 
districts. But Carnegie 
Mellon researchers see an-
other solution without in-
volving independent com-
missions. Ariel Proccacia, 
associate professor of com-
puter science, and Wesley 
Pegden, associate professor 
of mathematics, recently 
submitted a paper detailing 
an algorithm using com-
putational social choice 
theory to ensure fair divi-
sion, research that was 
supported by the National 
Science Foundation, the 
Sloan Foundation and the 
Of?ce of Naval Research, 
according to a university 
press release.
The algorithm can be 
thought of as an extension of 
the method children use to 
divide a cake into two — 
one child cuts the cake in 
half while the other child 
takes his or her preferred 
piece, reducing envy. Ap-
plied to gerrymandering, 
the algorithm would entail 
having one party divide up 
the districts, then having 
the other party choosing 
one district to “freeze” — or 
?nalize so that no one can 
subsequently change it — 
and re-mapping the remain-
ing districts according to its 
preferences, and so on until 
all the districts are “frozen”.
In their paper, Proccacia, 
Pegden, and Dingli Yu, a 
visiting student from Chi-
na’s Tsinghua University, 
detailed a mathematical 
proof of why this division 
protocol puts both parties 
on equal footing.
“If one party attempts to 
pack districts, for instance, 
the other party can sim-
ply not choose to freeze a 
packed district [one where 
speci?c concentrations of 
voters are packed into a 
district]. And because that 
party can then re-map the 
districts to eliminate the 
packing, the ?rst party 
would not get the opportuni-
ty to freeze a packed district 
either,” details a university 
press release regarding the 
intuition behind the fairness 
of the algorithm.
In an interview with The 
Tartan, Pegden detailed 
the motivation behind the 
project and why he and the 
team wanted to apply cake-
cutting techniques in par-
ticular. “The mathematics 
of fair division is all about 
leveraging competition 
between two sides to get a 
fair outcome; cake cutting 
is the classic example. 
If we want to be able 
to draw fair districts 
and we don’t know how 
to ?nd truly independent 
agents, then fair division 
algorithms were a natural 
thing to aim for,” explained 
Pegden, who had previously 
done research on detecting 
gerrymandering.
Proccacia saw gerry-
mandering as a natural ex-
tension of the ideas behind 
cake-cutting. “The view-
point [behind cake-cutting] 
seems natural in the context 
of redistricting (replacing 
‘good’ with ‘state’), as we 
would like to see the two 
parties interact in a way that 
gives rise to a districting 
both sides perceive as fair,” 
said Proccacia.
Pegden and Proccacia’s 
goal is that ultimately, states 
will adopt this protocol as 
their method of redistrict-
ing. They hope to promote 
this method through 
more press coverage and 
start a grassroots national 
conversation surrounding 
fair redistricting techniques.

Special to The Tartan
Carnegie Mellon is a 
global research university 
that offers unlimited oppor-
tunities for growth, experi-
ence, and interdisciplinary 
engagement for its students. 
We have seen Carnegie Mel-
lon graduates become the 
country’s next leaders in 
research, entrepreneurship, 
the STEM field, and a mul-
titude of other disciplines. 
Now, it’s time for Carnegie 
Mellon students, alumni, 
and other affiliates to show 
our appreciation to the 
institution that has given us 
so much.
This year, Carnegie 
Mellon University will be 
celebrating Giving Tuesday 
on Nov. 28. This is an 
incredible opportunity 
for students to give back! 
After the great success that 
the event had last year, 
Carnegie Mellon is hop-
ing to further engage its 
students, alumni, parents, 
faculty, staff, and friends 
this year by utilizing the 
power of social media. 
From 12 a.m. to 11:59 p.m., 
Carnegie Mellon University 
will be hosting a variety of 
events and challenges, both 
online and offline, to break 
the old record set last year 
of most donors giving in 
one day — 1,430! The high-
light of these challenges is 
the Presidential Student 
Match of a 2:1 dollar match 
for students only, so a $5 
gift can become $15 or a 
$10 gift can become $30. 
There are also matching 
funds for the Nooks project 
and the UPLIFT project, and 
much more!
To kick off the event, 
students are invited to a 
midnight party — Plaid 
Palooza! At that time, 
Carnegie Mellon will begin 
its social media challenges 
and award two students 
with $500 each to give to 
any fund of their choice. 
Throughout the rest of the 
day, you can find tabling 
events in the Cohon Center 
and get a chance to make 
your gift and recommend 
any fund to receive $500!
Where exactly does your 
donation go? The answer 
is simple: anywhere! You 
can choose to donate to any 
fund at Carnegie Mellon, in-
cluding a student organiza-
tion you are a part of, your 
department, your school, or 
anywhere else! Your dona-
tion can go towards helping 
anything you are passionate 
about growing and develop 
so that future generations 
of Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents can also partake in 
these experiences.
Make sure to check the 
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity and Carnegie Mellon 
Alumni pages of Facebook, 
Twitter, and LinkedIn 
and use the hashtag 
#givingCMUday through-
out Giving Tuesday for chal-
lenges and updates on the 
fundraising progress!
Remember, if your heart 
is in the work, give from 
your heart this Giving 
Tuesday!

Forlizzi named head of Human-Computer Interaction Institute 
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
Jodi Forlizzi, a 
professor in Carnegie 
Mellon University’s 
Human-Computer Inter-
action Institute (HCII), 
was recently appointed 
the Charles M. Geschke 
Director of the Human-
Computer Interaction 
Institute.
Forlizzi earned a 
bachelor’s degree in 
illustration from the 
University of the Arts in 
Philadelphia and a mas-
ter’s degree in interaction 
design at Carnegie Mellon 
before earning her Ph.D. 
in human-computer 
interaction and design 
at Carnegie Mellon. She 
has served as a faculty 
member at HCII, where 
she specializes in interac-
tion design, since 2000. 
Her work has focused on 
designing engaging and 
effective educational 
games, designing for 
health care, and doing re-
search and design work on 
social and assistive robots.
Additionally, Forlizzi 
is a member of the 
Association for Computing 
Machinery’s Computer-
Human Interaction Acade-
my, a group of researchers 
honored by the Special In-
terest Group on Comput-
er-Human Interaction for 
significant contributions 
to the field of human-
computer interaction. 
“Members are selected 
based on cumulative 
contributions to the HCI 
field, impact on the field 
through development of 
new research directions 
and/or innovations, in-
fluence on the work of 
others, and participation 
in the Association for 
Computing Machinery’s 
Special Interest Group in 
Computer-Human Inter-
action,” explains a univer-
sity press release from the 
School of Computer Sci-
ence. She was also hon-
ored by the Walter Reed 
Army Medical Center for 
excellence in human-
robot interaction design 
research.
The Human-Computer 
Interaction Institute “is 
a living laboratory” that 
investigates relationships 
between computer 
technology, human 
activity, and society, states 
the institute’s website.
“Founded in 1993, the 
HCII is a place where we 
work to understand and 
create technology that 
harmonizes with and 
improves human capa-
bilities, goals, and social 
environments through in-
terdisciplinary research 
and education in design, 
computer science, and 
behavioral and social 
sciences... We research 
how people work, play, 
and communicate within 
groups, organizations, 
and social structures, then 
we design, create, and 
evaluate technologies and 
tools to support human 
and social activities.”
Carnegie Mellon fac-
ulty members like Forlizzi 
continue to be among the 
most influential research-
ers in the field of human-
computer interaction 
since the 1960s.
Forlizzi was appointed 
her new position by 
Andrew Moore, Dean 
of the Carnegie Mellon 
University School of 
Computer Science.

Chalabi discusses her work to engage readers through data
By providing a window to 
her methodology, Mona al-
lows her audience to fully 
engage with the data and 
art,” stated Eleanor Tutt, 
Open Data and Knowledge 
Manager at Carnegie Li-
brary of Pittsburgh in a fol-
low-up email to the talk.
Her social media usage 
is not the only thing that 
distinguishes her journal-
ism. She firmly believes that 
all charts she makes should 
reflect something about 
their subject matter. She 
displayed generic charts 
and bar graphs and opined 
that while they were “pow-
erful, I guess, in terms of 
their clarity, but if you were 
to remove the labels these 
could be about absolutely 
anything, and I think charts 
should connect to the 
subject matter that they are 
depicting.”
Though Chalabi focused 
a lot on how to analyze and 
present data, she views her 
job primarily as that of “a 
journalist who really loves 
numbers.” While she works 
as a designer and with data, 
she primarily views herself 
as a journalist. “My job is to 
find reliable, recent num-
bers and get them in front of 
as many people as possible. 
Sometimes those numbers 
are buried way down deep 
in a database, sometimes 
they’re in the appendix of a 
PDF. But my job is to track 
them down and translate 
them from endless possible 
iterations of digital page to 
either words or images.”

The winner of the Ford 
College Community Chal-
lenge (Ford C3) mobility-
themed competition was 
The Aquaponics Project, a 
startup company which fo-
cuses on urban agriculture 
by raising aquatic animal 
and plants in a single, small 
environment. The company 
received $10,000 and a 
Ford Transit Connect pas-
senger van to transport its 
portable aquaponics facil-
ity for winning the chal-
lenge. The project team 
includes Carnegie Mellon 
University students Alexis 
Hoane, a sophomore chem-
istry major, and Sasha 
Cohen Ioannides, a soph-
omore in the College of 
Engineering. The team also 
consists of students from 
the University of Pittsburgh 
and the University of 
Michigan.
The goal of The 
Aquaponics Project is to 
provide an innovative solu-
tion to food production and 
waste and soil remediation. 
The startup company was 
established in 2016 when it 
created its first aquaponics 
farm, which produced 50 
pounds of basil and 80 tila-
pia last year.
“The vehicle will 
improve our aquaponics 
startup, allowing us to 
start integrating anaerobic 
digestion and improve 
food rescue mobilization in 
Pittsburgh. This will create 
a 21st-century food system 
that we hope other urban 
areas can model,” said 
Cohen Ioannides, director 
of design and maintenance 
for The Aquaponics Project.
The company previously 
pitched an idea for an 
anaerobic digestive system 
at the 2017 Ford C3 and 
won $25,000. The system 
involved a series of biologi-
cal processes in which mi-
croorganisms break down 
food waste in the absence 
of oxygen. The end product 
is biofertilizer and biogas, 
which is used for energy 
and heat.
The Aquaponics Project 
partners with various 
organizations around 
the city including Repair 
the World, The Door 
Campaign, and 412 Food 
Rescue, co-founded by 
Carnegie Mellon alumna 
Leah Lizarondo, a 2003 
graduate of the Heinz 
College of Information 
Systems and Public Policy. 
412 Food Rescue provides 
compost for the startup’s 
anaerobic digestive system.
“My biggest passion is 
creating accessibility to 
food,” said Ioannides. “The 
Aquaponics Project allows 
me to collaborate with 
other students on and off 
campus, get out and do the 
things I’m passionate about 
and get involved with 
the community.”
The signa-
ture Ford Mo-
bility Challenge 
celebrated 
the ten-year 
anniversary 
of the Ford 
C3 with a spe-
cial mobility-
themed compe-
tition, “Making 
Lives Better by 
Changing the 
Way People 
Move.” Three of 
the ten original 
winning teams 
were invited to 
Ford World Headquarters 
in Dearborn, Michigan, 
including The Aquaponics 
Project, to pitch their so-
lutions to a panel of Ford 
executives for the chance 
to win the passenger van 
and additional monetary 
prizes.
“The future of C3 will 
broaden our goal to help 
students create meaning-
ful, sustainable social en-
terprises to drive change,” 
said Mike Schmidt, direc-
tor of education and global 
community development 
for Ford Motor Company 
Fund, in a press release on 
the challenge. “Our goal is 
to create a movement, not 
a program, that allows stu-
dents to be a powerful force 
for good in this world and 
to help make people’s lives 
better across the globe.”
Home Inc.Ubator, led 
by Carnegie Mellon 
architecture major 
Sophie Nahrmann, was 
an additional 2017 C3 
winning team that received 
$25,000 for its portable 
residential housing mod-
ule prototype, which used 
virtual reality technology 
which enables residents to 
have input on the design of 
their affordable housing. 
According to a press re-
lease on the challenge, the 
purpose of the project is to 
“empower residents to de-
velop affordable housing, 
foster a more inclusive path 
to homeownership, con-
tribute to social mobility, 
provide education/training 
opportunities, and support 
community-based 
entrepreneurship.”
In second place came 
the Olin College of 
Engineering, where stu-
dents developed Coahoma 
Mobile Education, a proj-
ect which allowed rural 
youth in Coahoma County, 
Mississippi to explore top-
ics in the arts, technology, 
and entrepreneurship. The 
students will work with the 
youth to build electric gui-
tars, teaching them electri-
cally, carpentry, and 3D-
modeling skills in a mobile 
space.
Michigan Tech 
University landed third 
place. The students 
built a user-friendly 
medical transportation 
management system to 
allow their partner orga-
nization, Little Brothers-
Friends of the Elderly, to 
maximize their free door-
to-door medical transpor-
tation service for the el-
derly.
“Ford C3 has been a 
tremendously success-
ful program in that it has 
completely changed our 
mindset on how we engage 
with college students,” 
said Schmidt. “Through 
C3, we recognized that stu-
dents can be a huge force 
for good and that if we give 
them the right support, 
they can change in the 
world. And we are doing 
that, now, on a global 
scale.”

Historic local elections show the power of voters
After the elections of 2016, 
it would be easy to become 
disillusioned with the idea 
of representation, to begin 
doubting that your vote can make 
a difference. But after a hard 
year of unethical policies and 
unintelligible claims from the 
government, this year’s elections 
across the country have brought 
some much-needed hope to 
America. Those elected to of?ce 
include many Democrats as well 
as many ?rsts, from the ?rst 
black mayor in a number of towns 
and cities, to the ?rst Latina 
and Asian American women, to 
the ?rst transgender people, all 
serving in various states and even 
nationally.
In Framingham, MA, Yvonne 
Spicer is not only the ?rst black 
female mayor but also the ?rst 
mayor in Framingham’s 317-year 
history, as the residents narrowly 
voted to change from a town to a 
city form of government in April. 
At 39.1 percent, voter turnout 
was a record high for the last 25 
years in this historic election, 
and Spicer won with 58 percent 
of the vote. A native of Brooklyn, 
NY, Spicer has a doctorate in edu-
cational leadership and works to 
build capacity for STEM programs 
in schools. She will take of?ce on 
Jan. 1, 2018.
Vi Lyles will become Charlotte, 
NC’s ?rst black female mayor as 
well — with 58 percent of the 
vote, she easily beat her Republi-
can opponent Kenny Smith. Over 
the past three decades, she has 
served as a budget of?cial and as-
sistant city manager in city hall. 
North Carolina had a high voter 
turnout as well — for this elec-
tion, it was about 20 percent, 
which was higher than the pre-
dicted rate.
Jonathan McCollar will 
become the ?rst black mayor 
of Statesboro, GA, unseating 
the current mayor with his 
progressive platform and 52 
percent of the vote. Cairo, GA also 
voted for their ?rst black mayor: 
Booker Gainor, who is only 28 
years old. Brendon Barber and 
Ailment Collins became the ?rst 
black mayors of Georgetown, SC 
and Helena, MO, respectively. 
And in Milledgeville, GA, Mary 
Parham-Copelan won the election 
for mayor by a margin of only six 
votes, making her the ?rst woman 
and African American to be 
elected mayor.
Elizabeth Guzman and Hala 
Ayala became the ?rst two Lati-
nas elected to the Virginia House 
of Delegates, also turning their 
districts from Republican to Dem-
ocrat. Guzman immigrated from 
Peru to create a better life for her 
children, pursuing ?rst a com-
munity college degree and then 
several others. Ayala is a cyberse-
curity specialist who was involved 
in organizing the Women’s March 
last January. She supports raising 
minimum wage, equal pay and ac-
cess to health care for everyone, 
and increasing the percentage of 
women in government to ensure 
all voices are heard.
Kathy Tran, the ?rst Asian 
American woman elected to the 
Virginia House of Delegates, ?ed 
Vietnam with her parents when 
she was a baby. She supports 
strengthening public schools, 
the economy, and environmental 
protection, preventing gun 
violence, and immigration reform. 
Ravinder Bhalla, who was elected 
the mayor of Hoboken, became 
the ?rst Sikh mayor in all of New 
Jersey. He wants to upgrade 
Hoboken’s infrastructure, 
balance the budget, and push 
for environmentally sustainable 
policies to help residents in both 
the short and long terms.
Jenny Durkan previously 
made history as the ?rst gay U.S. 
attorney in American history, 
and has now become the ?rst 
lesbian mayor in Seattle. Some of 
her goals are to create affordable 
housing, help the homeless, and 
reform the criminal justice system. 
Zachary DeWolf, Seattle’s ?rst 
openly gay school board member, 
wants to close the gap created by 
differences in individual students’ 
circumstances, and create a safe 
environment for everyone to learn.
In Provo City, Utah, Michelle 
Kaufusi will be sworn in as 
the ?rst female mayor on Dec. 
5. She emphasizes strength 
when considering issues, and 
intends to focus on creating 
strong neighborhoods, strong 
budgets and other forms of ?scal 
management, a strong economy 
through businesses, and strong 
engagement from all residents.
In the Virgina state senate, 
Democrat Danica Roem became 
one of the country’s ?rst trans-
gender elected of?cials — she de-
feated Republican Rob Marshall, 
who has been elected 13 times 
in 26 years, wrote Virginia’s dis-
criminatory “bathroom bill,” and 
referred to Roem with incorrect 
pronouns throughout the elec-
tion cycle while at the same time 
refusing to debate with her. She 
plans to focus on four things: a 
traf?c problem that arises during 
rush hour, increasing and improv-
ing jobs by conducting studies 
and raising minimum wage, aid-
ing schools by bringing in more 
commercial taxes, alleviating 
overcrowding, and increasing 
teacher pay, and striving toward 
equality for those of different re-
ligions, races, genders, sexual ori-
entations, and disabilities.
In addition, Andrea Jenkins, 
who has been elected to the 
Minneapolis City Council, is the 
?rst black, openly-transgender 
woman ever elected to a public 
of?ce. She is a poet, activist, 
and historian, and curator of the 
Transgender Oral History Project 
at the University of Minnesota.
Despite the discouraging 
claims and actions that have been 
put forth by our national govern-
ment over the past few months, it 
is uplifting to see an effort to in-
corporate so much diversity into 
our local elections. The people 
elected to these of?ces can have 
meaningful impact on our day-
to-day lives, and Americans have 
shown through our votes the is-
sues that are important to us as 
a nation to address. Voters be-
ing aware of current events and 
showing up to cast their ballots 
played an important role in bring-
ing about this change — it is im-
portant to remember the ways we 
can shape policy and make a dif-
ference as we move forward into 
the future.

One of the greatest powers of 
the United States lies in the ability 
of its higher education system 
to attract diverse and talented 
students from all over the world. 
According to the 2017 Open 
Doors Report by the Institute 
of International Education, the 
international student population 
in the United States increased by 
3.4 percent to 1,078,822 students 
this year. This large presence of 
international students amounts to 
around $32 billion that is brought 
into the U.S. economy.
Recently, however, many 
universities around the U.S. 
have seen a dip in the number of 
foreign applicants. A survey of 
250 colleges, conducted by the 
American Association of College 
Registrars and Admissions 
Of?cers (AACRAO), has found 
that “39 [percent] of responding 
institutions reported a decline 
in international applicants.” The 
survey further observed that the 
highest declines in applicants 
were from the Middle East, 
while the number of applications 
from India and China was also 
impacted.
“[Many international stu-
dents] said they were concerned 
about the Trump effect,” said Wim 
Wiewel, President of Portland 
State University, in an interview 
with The New York Times. “I’d say 
the rhetoric and actual execu-
tive orders are de?nitely having a 
chilling effect.”
Indeed, many call this decline 
in applicants an outcome of the 
“Trump effect:” the effects that 
President Trump’s actions, words, 
and political agenda bring to the 
U.S. both on a domestic and an 
international level. From what I 
see, this decline in the number of 
foreign applicants to U.S. colleges 
can be divided into two main at-
tributes. First, the visa application 
process has become more dif?cult 
under the Trump presidency, es-
pecially for students in the Middle 
East, preventing many students 
who wish to come to the U.S. from 
pursuing such an academic ca-
reer. Second, the political climate 
of the United States has put much 
worry into many families around 
the world, prompting many stu-
dents to look to domestic higher 
education systems or those of 
other countries like China, Japan, 
France, and the United Kingdom.
As an international student 
myself, I have experienced both 
of these challenges in choosing 
to come to the United States for 
college. While I was fortunate to 
reside in the United States previ-
ously, making my visa application 
process easier than most, I have a 
couple of friends in South Korea 
who were caught in the bureau-
cratic mess of the visa application 
process, which prevented them 
from attending U.S. colleges in 
the fall of 2017. As for the political 
climate of the U.S., Trump and his 
agenda have instigated a changed 
reputation of the United States in 
the eyes of countries around the 
world. The words and actions of 
the President — the travel bans 
imposed by the administration, 
for example — and the many dis-
plays of violence and national di-
vision — mass shootings and the 
more public presence of white 
supremacy, to name a couple — 
have certainly proven to many 
families around the world that the 
sentiments of isolationism and na-
tionalism are growing. In essence, 
it has become harder and less at-
tractive to be an international stu-
dent in the United States.
“Are they going to be welcomed 
in the United States? Are the 
Americans going to treat their 
sons and daughters well? Are they 
going to be safe on U.S. campuses 
and in U.S. cities?” asked Gary 
Bergman, founder, and president 
of College Study US, in an 
interview with Newsweek. “A lot 
of the comments that are 
coming out of the current 
administration are leading 
a lot of families to really 
take a step back and wonder 
if the U.S. is really a good 
place to go for 
their education.”
As Bergman 
comments above, 
for many foreigners, 
the United 
States is no 
longer seen 
as the “land of 
immigrants.” The 
once deeply held values of 
diversity and openness seem to 
have changed to become more 
exclusive rather than inclusive. 
As such, it is expected that fewer 
and fewer students will choose the 
U.S. as their destination for higher 
education; it is the reputation 
that the U.S. displays on 
the international stage 
that has caused such 
a phenomenon. In 
order for the U.S. to 
continue enjoying 
the large presence 
of international 
students on its 
campuses, its 
reputation in the 
international 
community 
must be revived. 
If the Trump 
administration 
continues 
its agenda on 
immigration, 
maintaining its 
stance and proceeding 
to make negative 
remarks on foreigners 
or immigrants, the United 
States will no longer be at the 
frontiers of higher education and 
potentially risk the intellectual 
leadership of many of its academic 
institutions.

Graduate students are under 
attack in the latest House tax 
bill. The GOP’s plan is to tax our 
tuition waivers as if they were in-
come, and to remove student loan 
interest deductions, making grad-
uate school substantially more ex-
pensive. According to an analysis 
by our very own Graduate Student 
Assembly (GSA), some Ph.D. stu-
dents may owe $10k annually in 
taxes under this bill. This is unac-
ceptable.
The ?rst Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity responses to the bill came 
from our GSA (see their appear-
ance in several articles, includ-
ing in Wired). Carnegie Mellon 
administrators seem to have been 
caught unaware and uninformed. 
Yet this information has been pub-
lic since Nov. 2, when the House 
Bill was ?rst released, and at the 
time of writing, the administra-
tion still has no public plan.
In fact, in Interim President 
Jahanian’s only email to the 
University at large, he mentions 
only “proposals to tax graduate 
student stipends,” which is 
not even the correct issue. The 
proposal is to tax our tuition, not 
our stipends. This response fails 
to inspire con?dence. By way of 
contrast, Cornell and Notre Dame 
have already released de?nitive 
statements about whether their 
students are affected by the 
proposed tuition tax. Why has our 
administration not made a similar 
statement?
Either the administration sim-
ply does not know, or it is delib-
erately keeping us in the dark to 
prevent a panic.
Perhaps the administration is 
genuinely clueless, due to CMU’s 
decentralized nature. Without 
central oversight, there is wild 
variation in how tuition, stipends, 
fees, and health insurance are 
handled across the colleges.
What seems likely is that, as 
a private school with extremely 
high tuition, CMU will be hurt a lot 
more by this tax bill than public R1 
universities. It’s bad enough that 
we students pay $2,000 plus tax 
for health insurance. This addi-
tional tax burden will make gradu-
ate school ?scally untenable. Ei-
ther the university will shoulder 
the ?nancial burden or students 
will choose to go elsewhere.
Ph.D. students commonly do 
not take classes after their ?rst 
two years, but tuition is still paid 
on their behalf. So what does our 
tuition fund? Our previous presi-
dent made nearly $900,000 an-
nually, while annual stipends for 
CMU Ph.D. students can be as low 
as $13,500 per year (for reference, 
according to one I-20, the cost of 
living in Pittsburgh is $20,500).
And what if the bill passes? 
The Trump administration wants 
this signed by Thanksgiving and 
telling ourselves “it will never 
pass” is delusional. If not passed, 
the bill could come back in some 
watered-down form, likely still 
harmful (like Trump’s immigra-
tion ban and healthcare bill). We 
need to be prepared to ?ght a long 
?ght against this provision when-
ever it appears.
If passed, the bill will take ef-
fect April 6, likely affecting every 
graduate student on campus, and 
the University needs a plan for 
when that happens.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: CMU MUST DEFEND GRADUATE STUDENTS
MADELINE KIM
“Take her swimming on the 
?rst date” is a common saying cir-
culating on the internet and be-
ing shared among men who joke 
about how women “hide” behind 
layers of makeup, thus deceiving 
the world with arti?cially good 
looks. However, this statement 
has become more than just a silly 
meme. Ashot Gabrelyanov created 
an app called MakeApp that essen-
tially makes a camera ?lter that 
predicts what women look like 
without makeup.
As a makeup enthusiast, I ob-
viously had to give this app a try. 
For an app that costs money, I was 
not impressed with the results. 
Despite the poor estimate of what 
my bare face looks like, I could not 
help but laugh. There are men out 
in the world who may take a photo 
of me in my usual “cake face,” toss 
it through this app, and decide 
whether I am attractive enough to 
be associated with — all without 
knowing anything about me.
There has been heavy criticism 
targeted at the app. Many 
articles have claimed that such 
a “removal” of makeup is sexist 
because it makes men use a 
makeup-less woman’s appearance 
be a dealbreaker for whether he 
wants to pursue a relationship 
with her. Buzzfeed pointed out 
that a man — not a woman — was 
in charge of the creation of the app 
in the title, heavily hinting that 
Gabrelyanov had sexist intentions 
behind the app.
What some feminists and some 
men fail to realize is that a lot of 
people don’t wear makeup be-
cause they feel ashamed of their 
appearances. I don’t deny the pos-
sibility that there may be someone 
out there who cakes on makeup to 
hide insecurities. If that someone 
is reading this article, I hope there 
soon comes a realization that 
one’s beauty and one’s worth does 
not lie in makeup. However, for 
many people, makeup is a creative 
outlet. Much like wearing a nice 
out?t instead of pajamas, it can 
boost one’s con?dence and make 
one feel more prepared to face the 
day. No amount of makeup in the 
world changes the value or beauty 
of a person. Kim Kardashian is the 
same reality star with and with-
out her famous dramatic contour. 
Similarly, a person hasn’t shape-
shifted by applying makeup (and 
frankly, did not invest so much 
money to impress someone who 
demands all the products to be 
washed down the drain).
What’s notable is that 
Gabrelyanov claims that the app 
could be used to identify victims 
of human traf?cking. “In most 
of these cases, makeup is heavily 
used to disguise the age and/
or identity of these people,” he 
said in an emailed statement. “If 
human traf?ckers can hide these 
victim’s identities, their chances 
of rescue are low.” Of course, the 
app has a long way to go, but this 
is a possibility. However, if this is 
the direction the app is heading, 
something to consider would be 
to change the image of the app. 
Instead of marketing it as an app 
where a user can play around with 
camera ?lters for fun to see what a 
potential girlfriend would look like 
bare-faced, further emphasize its 
potential usage to identify victims 
who may be heavily disguised with 
makeup.
If you insist on being outraged 
by makeup, I suggest you look into 
the lack of racial inclusiveness in 
the beauty industry that conve-
niently excludes consumers with 
darker skin colors. Just let people 
use makeup as they feel comfort-
able and realize that they aren’t 
“hiding” something from you.

Tech has in?ltrated every as-
pect of our lives: Uber has dis-
placed taxi cabs, Airbnb has trans-
formed hotels, and Amazon has 
started to crush brick-and-mortar 
retailers. While disruption has up-
rooted countless industries, it has 
had a limited impact — so far — on 
the hospitality industry. Restau-
rants have experienced only mod-
erate disruption due to technology 
and high-end restaurant options 
have been particularly spared. 
These ?ne dining establishments 
may allow guests to make reser-
vations online or read a menu on 
their webpages, but that is gener-
ally the extent of technological 
involvement. This will not last for-
ever, though, as ?ne dining estab-
lishments begin to integrate more 
data-driven technology into their 
daily operations to boost their bot-
tom line.
Until recently, most technolo-
gies in restaurants were focused 
on the front of house – employee 
interactions with customers. These 
technologies included reserva-
tion systems, customer data ag-
gregators and order management 
systems. New technologies are 
beginning to move to other parts 
of the restaurant, like the kitchen 
itself. One nascent product, Food-
pairing, helps chefs discover new 
combinations of foods that can 
surprise and delight the palette. 
Combinations include items rang-
ing from common spices to unique 
varieties of ?sh. While new pair-
ings were previously discovered 
through a basic guess-and-check 
method, Foodpairing claims to 
analyze “unique scienti?c and con-
sumer data sources in combination 
with big data… for identifying the 
successful ?avors of tomorrow.” 
This methodology may generate 
some peculiar-sounding combi-
nations on menus, but they’ll be 
worthwhile if a desirable ?avor is 
produced and customers return for 
more.
Outside of the kitchen, ?ne 
dining establishments are also in-
vesting in data analytics to drive 
pro?ts. New systems, such as 
Upserve, track every detail related 
to a diner’s experience, including 
their contact information, visit 
history, past expenditures and in-
dividual food and drink orders. 
This data is compiled across the 
restaurant and can unveil power-
ful insights about the restaurant’s 
operation. For instance, Upserve’s 
platform automatically generates 
a scorecard that ranks menu items 
in comparison to each other and 
identi?es what types of diners are 
most likely to order each dish. A re-
peat customer may select an entrée 
that is rarely ordered by ?rst time 
diners, so this dish would be clas-
si?ed as a “hidden gem.” Upserve 
claims that this meaningful data 
can help servers give recommen-
dations and help restaurants retain 
their customers over the long term 
by providing better service.
Another domain affected by 
an increased role of technology is 
in neither the kitchen nor the res-
taurant itself, but rather on the 
web. Online social media giants 
like Instagram and Facebook, as 
well as online review aggregators 
such as Yelp, are a dominant tech-
nology in the hospitality industry. 
Diners are eager to share pictures 
of their meals “tagged” with the 
restaurant’s name, especially at 
exclusive and trendy restaurants. 
“The average guest takes pictures 
for 10 minutes before ordering 
anything,” says Madelyn Markoe, 
owner of Media Noche, an Insta-
gram hot-spot restaurant in San 
Francisco. Often, restaurants even 
have their own Instagram pages 
to promote seasonal menu items 
or nightly specials. While the free 
marketing is valuable, restaurants 
must now dedicate additional time 
and energy to fully engage with 
customers online.
To help restaurants optimize 
their online presence, Avero, a 
long-standing hospitality tech-
nology company, launched Avero 
Buzz in December of 2016. Avero 
Buzz is a “social listening tool” of-
fering a centralized platform for 
communicating with customers 
across all online platforms. This 
service is particularly impactful for 
restaurant groups with a portfolio 
of different ?ne dining establish-
ments, each with its own account 
on Yelp, Instagram, and Facebook. 
It integrates restaurant data with 
social data and generates analytics 
measuring the effectiveness of so-
cial media marketing campaigns. 
Though there are many ways to 
measure campaign effectiveness, 
the Avero Buzz platform focuses 
on changes in customer volume 
and customer behavior over long-
term periods. By recognizing these 
changes and adapting to them, res-
taurants can derive real value from 
their customers’ online habits.
Across restaurant operations, 
data is playing an increased role. 
The data of ?avor is helping chefs 
try new pairings and combina-
tions. The data of customer history 
is shaping pro?tability and the din-
ing experience. And the constant 
chatter of customer interactions 
across various social platforms 
online is a low-cost yet meaning-
ful opportunity for publicity. Yet as 
these technologies and others con-
tinue to integrate into restaurants, 
other forms of innovation seem far 
off. Hopefully the 3D-printed ham-
burger is not in the near future.

Hyperpartisanship blurs moral lines in Alabama election
JENNY YU
Junior Staffwriter
Many of us have most likely 
grown up with parents or teachers 
instructing us to not judge others 
simply because their beliefs are 
different from our own. While this 
surely has its merits, it is intended 
to be applicable in a very general 
sense, with glaring exceptions.
I certainly would never judge 
someone harshly for their taste 
in food or music — well, perhaps 
only jokingly — but I do believe 
that politics is a key belief that lies 
outside the realm of that piece of 
advice. It should be perfectly ac-
ceptable to be judged for one’s po-
litical views.
I do not mean this as a hard-
and-fast rule, however, as every-
one should be left to his or her own 
devices to decide to what degree, 
personally, politics play a role 
in his or her evaluation of some-
one. What I do argue, instead, is 
that people should not be deemed 
closed-minded or otherwise for 
choosing to let politics color their 
opinions on someone else.
Relationships in life are often 
based on things shared and other 
commonalities, as many of them 
seemingly arise out of shared cir-
cumstances. Therefore, I hold the 
belief that it is de?nitely easier to 
befriend someone who holds the 
same set of political views.
Of course, I de?nitely am not 
saying that, for example, Repub-
licans have trouble befriending 
or cannot befriend those who are 
Democrats or vice versa, as those 
friendships often occur. Further-
more, the variation within those 
two ideologies is as varied as 
the political spectrum itself, so 
one may ?nd themselves sharing 
many opinions despite identifying 
as a part of completely different 
parties.
My message is that, should 
someone choose to not enter into 
a relationship with someone, ro-
mantic or platonic, they should be 
allowed to cite politics as a reason 
why. People should be held ac-
countable for their beliefs, even 
if that accountability amounts to 
judgment. For example, while I 
am perfectly happy to and do have 
friends who are more conserva-
tive than I am, I cannot see myself 
dating someone who has views 
that deviate far from mine.
Some people would person-
ally not associate themselves with 
those who are rude or those who 
partake in activities against their 
own morals, such as doing drugs, 
so why should politics be any dif-
ferent? By choosing to espouse 
and stand behind a certain set 
of stances, you indicate to others 
exactly what is and isn’t impor-
tant to you as a person. Abortion 
rights or no abortion rights, af-
?rmative action or no af?rma-
tive action, gun control or no gun 
control — what you think affects 
how you behave and how you 
vote, which in turn affects those 
around you.
Being offended has turned into 
an ugly term in recent years, as 
more people nowadays are being 
mocked for being “overly sensi-
tive” or “easily triggered.” But, 
if what another says or believes 
affronts, invalidates, or belittles 
your own views, you have a right 
to be offended, to judge another 
for thinking that way, or to choose 
not to associate with them.
There can certainly be harm-
ful political beliefs, such as being 
against gay marriage or being for 
neo-Nazism, to name some of the 
ones that are more unilaterally be-
lieved as problematic. As for the 
most controversial ones, it will be 
up to each person individually to 
decide what it is and where his or 
her boundaries lie.
In a tumultuous time and coun-
try like the contemporary United 
States, we ?nd it harder and 
harder to separate politics and our 
everyday lives. Even in the most 
recent presidential election, I am 
sure that many people have or 
have seen their friends be shocked 
when someone they know come 
out in support of a candidate that 
they themselves despise.

Yet again, America ?nds hyper-
partisanship interfering with eth-
ics. On Dec. 12, voters in Alabama 
must decide on a senator to repre-
sent their state: Democratic can-
didate Doug Jones or Republican 
candidate Roy Moore. But these 
candidates differ on more than 
their parties. Moore has been ac-
cused of sexually abusing minors 
by at least four different women, 
who were all in their teens at the 
time of the alleged assault.
What should be a simple choice 
— a choice between a man who 
prosecuted members of the Ku Klux 
Klan and an alleged pedophile — is 
apparently a dif?cult question be-
ing raised and warranting heated 
debates.
Alabama is not known to be the 
most liberal state. Gallup consid-
ers Alabama to be the ?fth most 
conservative state in the U.S., and 
conservatives outnumber liberals 
by approximately 30 percentage 
points. Thus, it comes as no sur-
prise that Moore had enjoyed being 
in the lead up until recently despite 
voters knowing that they are poten-
tially supporting a pedophile.
Additionally, Alabama is not 
known to be the most accepting 
of change or authority. Years back 
during the Civil War, Alabama 
proudly joined the secession to 
keep allowing slave ownership. It 
was one of the last states to racially 
integrate schools and was reluctant 
to allow marriage equality. Today, 
party chairwoman Terry Lathan 
stated that “Alabamians will be 
the ultimate jury in this election, 
not the media or those from afar,” 
pushing away anyone outside the 
state of Alabama. Loyalty is an 
admirable quality. However, this 
intention to defend and protect 
Alabama by mindlessly defending 
its every action regardless of 
right or wrong ultimately hurts 
Alabama. Voting for a Democrat 
does break the Republican status 
quo of the state, but this choosing 
a candidate to represent Alabama 
just because of political af?liation 
does anything but protect Alabama. 
It’s committing state suicide.
Although Jones led the polls by 
?ve percentage points as of Nov. 18, 
it is frightening to think that just 
four days prior, Moore maintained 
a lead in a poll.
Even some of those who be-
lieve that Moore is a child molester 
consider Moore to be the more 
quali?ed candidate. Right-leaning 
author David Horowitz tweeted 
“electing a Dem strengthens a 
party that defends [criminals such 
as Obama and Clinton whose] 
crimes are far far worse,” Jones is 
automatically an inferior choice. 
Others on Twitter have shared this 
common sentiment. These votes 
are not swayed by actual policies 
or morals; they are made solely by 
party af?liation. This is not an is-
sue that only Republicans or right-
wing parties are susceptible to, but 
we are in a situation where there is 
a great political division and exac-
erbated by a president that further 
perpetuates a division between the 
two prominent political parties.
Controversial blogger Elizabeth 
Johnston, known as The Activist 
Mommy, posted a meme on her 
Twitter, placing Moore on a high-
er moral ground than Jones. The 
meme argues that since Moore al-
legedly molested a child but Jones 
de?nitely advocates for what she 
calls “actual infanticide,” Moore 
is the more ethical choice. Ad-
ditionally, she has spoken to sup-
port Moore, whom she believes 
is “the greatest judge in America 
who has faithfully fought for 20 
years for the unborn, traditional 
marriage, the 10 commandments, 
and the constitution.” Her defend-
ing Moore is not that surprising, 
given her perception that Christian 
America is under attack. However, 
it is disheartening to know that she 
in?uences thousands of people on 
the Internet and can potentially 
validate hardcore Republicans who 
ultimately decide that party is more 
important than policy or ethics.
I understand that topics such 
as abortion are sensitive and 
topics of great gravity. However, 
latching onto a candidate because 
of one stance and disregarding 
everything else about the candidate 
is uneducated at best. Moore 
“?ghting for the unborn” does not 
erase the striking evidence that 
states he preyed on young and 
vulnerable girls.
Hyperpartisanship is a growing 
problem in the U.S., and it is not 
hard to see why it has increased 
in intensity over the years. Echo 
chambers and social media 
algorithms strategically lay out 
what media we surround ourselves 
with. Thus, we are more likely 
to be surrounded by media that 
aligns with our preexisting beliefs. 
Seeing something that contradicts 
our paradigm can be upsetting 
and unenjoyable for someone with 
strong opinions on a particular 
topic. However, this kind of group 
polarization that transforms what 
would be moderate stances into 
polarized stances.
I have lived in Alabama for ten 
years of my life. Am I surprised that 
my home state is choosing party 
over ethics? No. Am I ashamed and 
wish that I could be registered to 
vote in my home state instead of 
Pennsylvania? Yes. With less than 
a month remaining until the elec-
tion, all I can hope is that we can 
separate Moore from the party that 
he so poorly represents.

Bees and butter?ies are 
experiencing widespread 
population decline, creat-
ing public concern in re-
cent years. Data collected 
in Germany suggest that 
it’s not just bees and but-
ter?ies at risk: insect popu-
lations overall have plum-
meted by more than 75 
percent since 1989.
Scientists have known 
about the population de-
cline for several years. 
However, they didn’t know 
how many species were 
declining, and they didn’t 
expect it to be happening 
so fast.
The insect population 
data comes from a group in 
Germany called the Krefeld 
Entomological Society. The 
Krefeld Society, whose 
members are mostly ama-
teur entomologists, has 
been collecting data on in-
sect populations since the 
1980s in 63 different na-
ture preserves. The mem-
bers travel to a given spot 
every few years to set up 
an insect trap: essentially, 
a fabric tent suspended 
above a jar of alcohol. The 
insects ?y into the tent and 
can’t ?y out. While they’re 
trapped in the tent, the ris-
ing vapor from the alcohol 
below gradually inebriates 
them, and they drop into 
the jar. The Krefeld Society 
can then catalog the num-
ber, type, and weight of the 
collected insects.
The fact that they col-
lect any species that ?ies 
into the trap is what makes 
this study so important. It’s 
rare to ?nd numbers on the 
population trends of most 
insects. While researchers 
have kept fairly consistent 
tabs on iconic insects like 
monarch butter?ies and 
honey bees, “we have a 
pretty good track record of 
ignoring most noncharis-
matic species,” says Joe 
Nocera, an ecologist at the 
University of New Bruns-
wick. Because the Krefeld 
Society isn’t focused on any 
one kind of insect, they can 
look at the big picture.
Based on this study, the 
big picture for insects looks 
grim. While the Krefeld 
Society is still working on 
cataloging the species in 
their collection, and don’t 
yet know all the details, 
they do know the biomass 
of each catch (the com-
bined weight of all the 
insects). They found that 
since 1989, insect biomass 
has gone down by over 75 
percent. 
This number — far larg-
er than expected — has left 
the scienti?c community 
reeling. “If we lose insects 
we’re doomed,” says Dave 
Goulson, professor of bi-
ology at the University of 
Sussex in the U.K. “I know 
this sounds overly dramat-
ic, but we absolutely are. 
Life on Earth would be ut-
terly changed. We wouldn’t 
be able to grow our crops. 
Dung would build up in the 
?elds. Life on Earth would 
essentially cease. So, we 
absolutely have to take this 
really seriously.”
It’s hard to ?gure out 
what can be done to solve 
the problem of insect dis-
appearance without know-
ing what’s making the in-
sects disappear in the ?rst 
place. 
In the Krefeld study, 
the Krefeld Society mem-
bers worked with scien-
tists at German universi-
ties to analyze their data, 
examining several factors 
like the changes in weather 
and local plant life. No sim-
ple correlations have been 
revealed, suggesting that 
multiple complex factors 
are causing the population 
decline.
One factor is likely the 
way that land is being 
used. All the data in the 
Krefeld study was collected 
from protected nature ar-
eas, but the surrounding 
land can play a factor in 
how well the nature pre-
serve can support insect 
species. (Insects, which 
travel frequently, don’t pay 
attention to the boundary 
between the preserve and 
private land.) 
When ?elds are fertil-
ized to make better graz-
ing land, wild?owers 
(which insects need) are 
replaced by grasses. When 
towns and urban areas 
replace ?elds, the lights 
confuse nocturnal insects 
and disrupt their mating. 
“We’ve lost huge amounts 
of habitat, which has cer-
tainly contributed to all 
these declines,” Goulson 
says. “If we turn all the 
seminatural habitats to 
wheat and corn?elds, 
then there will be virtually 
no life in those ?elds.”
In agricultural areas, 
the use of pesticides has 
also contributed to the de-
cline of insects. Decades 
ago, when pesticides like 
DDT were exposed as 
poisonous, they were re-
placed by safer alterna-
tives: safer for humans, 
but with lethal effects 
for insects.  Neonic-
otinoid pesticides, intro-
duced in the 1980s when 
the Krefeld Society began 
their study, are considered 
safer for humans than 
many alternatives because 
they are applied to seeds 
before planting rather 
than to growing crops.

Research suggests bleak future for insects worldwide
Scientists study effectiveness of opioid treatments
SARAH KIM
Staffwriter
In an era where drug 
overdose deaths are the 
leading cause of injury 
and death in the United 
States, the abuse and mis-
use of opioids is a growing, 
alarming public health is-
sue — namely, the “opioid 
crisis”. According to the 
United States Health and 
Human Services, 12.5 mil-
lion people misused pre-
scription opioids in 2015 
alone, 2.1 million of those 
being ?rst-time offenders. 
Clearly, this is a dan-
gerous social problem that 
doesn’t seem easy to pre-
vent. The government has 
been trying to tackle this 
issue since the late 1990s, 
but there are few solutions 
with much scienti?c proof 
or potential.
Suboxone, a relatively 
mild opioid containing a 
combination of buprenor-
phine hydrochloride and 
naloxone hydrochloride, 
was approved by the Unit-
ed States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as 
an effective treatment of 
opioid addiction in 2002. 
Patients undergoing 
treatment take daily doses 
of Suboxone either in the 
form of strips that dissolve 
on the tongue or tablets 
to minimize withdrawal 
symptoms. 
Although much more 
expensive, this is preferred 
to another addiction medi-
cation known as metha-
done because it can be 
prescribed by primary doc-
tors, and does not require 
specially licensed clinics.
Vivitrol is a relatively 
new form of addiction 
medication approved by 
the FDA only in 2010. This 
injection of naltrexone  
blocks the effects of opi-
oids is taken once a month, 
as its effects last slightly 
over 28 days. According to 
Alkermes — a global bio-
pharmacutical company, it 
is by far the most expensive 
opioid addiction treatment 
substance, costing $500 
per shot through Medicaid 
and $1,000 through pri-
vate insurance. Despite its 
high cost, Vivitrol has been 
supported and encouraged 
by Alkermes as an alterna-
tive for Suboxone, as many 
people view Suboxone as 
simply substituting a dead-
ly opioid (heroin) with 
another addictive but less 
dangerous opioid (Subox-
one itself.)
In an article in the 
Washington Post, Dr. Nora 
Volkow, director of the 
National Institute on Drug 
Abuse, explained that Vi-
vitrol offers “a tremen-
dous advantage” to rural 
patients who cannot easily 
access trained doctors and 
specialized daily treat-
ment. She says, “this study 
removes a barrier, the be-
lief that (Vivitrol) was not 
as good a medication.”
A study comparing 
these two forms of treat-
ment medication was pub-
lished in The Lancet on 
Tuesday. It was led by Dr. 
Joshua D. Lee of the New 
York University School of 
Medicine.

New imaging technique helps disgnose sick corals
NAVIYA SINGLA
SciTech Editor
On Nov. 6, Jamie M. 
Caldwell, a disease ecologist 
at Stanford University, and 
her colleagues published a 
paper titled “Intra-colony 
disease progression induc-
es fragmentation of coral 
?uorescent pigments” in 
Scienti?c Reports. 
The paper describes a rel-
atively new technique called 
live-imaging laser scanning 
confocal microscopy and its 
applications in better under-
standing the health of corals.
Coral ?uorescence — 
the ability of corals to glow 
in shades of red, blue or 
green under some light 
wavelengths, is a com-
mon yet poorly understood 
phenomenon. 
Corals contain ?uores-
cent proteins that possibly 
allow it to perform photo-
synthesis better by using 
light that would otherwise 
be unusable. This phenom-
enon helps absorb the sun’s 
ultraviolet rays and re?ect it 
back to the symbiotic organ-
isms so the they can photo-
synthesize under insuf?cient 
sunlight. Some scientists 
also suggest that this ?uores-
cent helps protect the coral 
ecosystem from the harsh 
rays of the sun.
The researchers along 
with Caldwell, say that coral 
?uorescence is a “potentially 
powerful non-invasive in-
trinsic marker of coral dis-
ease”. Previous research sug-
gests that stressors such as 
heat and wounding affects 
coral ?uorescent pigments, 
but this study is the ?rst 
to suggest a relationship 
between coral infectious 
disease and ?uorescent pig-
ments. The research studied 
the difference between ?uo-
rescent pigment distribu-
tion in healthy and diseased 
living samples of Montipora 
capitata coral — commonly 
known as rice coral or pore 
coral. it is a type of reef coral 
typically found in Hawaii. 
The diseased sample in this 
case was arti?cially cre-
ated, by infecting it with the 
Montipora white syndrome 
— bacterial infection that 
causes tissue loss.
While comparing, the 
scientists found that the two 
coral samples looked simi-
lar on a macroscopic level. 
However, after observing 
closely, they found that the 
sick sample had lost ?uores-
cence and the distribution 
of the ?uorescent pigments 
was a lot more scattered and 
disorganized. 
In fact, according to an 
article on Science News, the 
healthy coral had 1.2 times 
more ?orescence area as 
compared to the diseased 
coral.
Drew Harwell, a disease 
ecologist at Cornell Univer-
sity says in an article in Sci-
ence News that research in 
this ?eld, “is transormative 
in our struggle to visualize 
the dance between pathogen 
attack and host response in 
the initial attack.“
This type of coral is very 
dependent on the organ-
isms called zooxanthellae 
that live inside it. The tem-
perature of the sea chases 
out these organisms, leaving 
the coral colorless and sus-
ceptible to disease. Corals 
die very quickly after that. 
As habitat destruction and 
global warming wipes out 
reef corals at an alarming 
rate, research like this is a 
step forward in organizing 
better conservation efforts.

Insect population declining
from OPIOD, A7
This was the largest 
study so far to directly 
compare the effectiveness 
of Vivitrol with that of 
Suboxone.
The study was con-
ducted with 570 adults, 
most addicted to heroin, 
and found that 52 percent 
of those who were under 
Vivitrol relapsed through-
out the span of the 24-
week study. 
This is a number only 
slightly lower than the 56 
percent of patients that re-
lapsed under Suboxone in 
the same study.
While discovering the 
potential of Vivitrol to be-
come a more widespread 
form of treatment for opi-
oid addicts in the nation, 
the study also revealed a 
fatal ?aw of Vivitrol. 
This not only makes the 
results of the study much 
more dif?cult to interpret 
but also speaks to the limi-
tations of Vivitrol itself as a 
treatment substance. 
A large number of par-
ticipants were not even 
able to start treatment 
with Vivitrol because a 
detox period (complete 
abstention from drug use) 
of three days to one week 
is required for its consump-
tion as opposed to the oth-
er medications, where the 
patient can make the tran-
sition seamlessly.  
According to Stat News, 
patients failed to start on 
Vivitrol at four times the 
rate that they did Subox-
one because of this dif?-
cult barrier to beginning 
treatment.
“It’s going to take a few 
days or a week or more 
to get them on naltrex-
one in the ?rst place,” 
said Dr. Lee. “And that 
detox hurdle does not ex-
ist for buprenorphine or 
Suboxone.” 
However, the research 
still does encourage medi-
cal professionals and treat-
ment providers to offer 
both medications, as re-
lapse rates are signi?cant-
ly higher if patients don’t 
get onto and continue a 
medication.
The bottom line is that 
both forms of medication 
should be widely available 
and readily offered to pa-
tients suffering from opi-
oid addiction. 
However, medication 
isn’t effective on its own. 
Other research shows 
that couseling and famil-
ial  support signi?canlty 
improve the effectiveness 
of the treatment provided. 
Now that the effective-
ness and safety precau-
tions of both Suboxone 
and Vivitrol have been 
studied in depth and pub-
lished, we have taken a 
step forward to treat this 
huge public health issue. 
Perhaps it was because of 
the lack of such evidence 
and research in the past 
that led to severe under-
treatment of the opioid 
epidemic.
Suboxone, Vivitrol treat opiod addiction equally well

 However, they 
have disastrous 
effects on insects. 
When bees are 
exposed to these 
insecticides, 
they become less 
able to navigate 
and communi-
cate with other 
bees. In wasps, 
neonicotinoid 
exposure cuts 
mating rates in 
half.
Neonicotinoids have 
already been revealed as 
a major culprit in the de-
clining population of bees 
and other pollinators. Be-
cause neonicotinoids dis-
solve in water so easily, 
rainwater can carry them 
far away from farm ?elds. 
In meadows adjacent 
to agricultural areas, 
?owers produce pollen 
and nectar that contains 
more neonicotinoids than 
the crops the insecticides 
were intended for, Goul-
son and his colleagues 
showed in 2015. Despite 
the fact that they are de-
monstrably harmful, neo-
nicotinoids are the most 
commonly used insecti-
cides today.
The decline of insects is 
a problem that needs to be 
taken very, very seriously. 
Almost our entire agri-
cultural system depends 
on insects to pollinate 
plants so that they can 
produce fruits, vegeta-
bles, and seeds. If we have 
no insects, we will not be 
able to grow food.
We aren’t the only ones 
who will suffer if insects 
go. Researchers have al-
ready connected insects’ 
decreasing numbers to 
the population declines 
of starlings in North 
America. Birds, reptiles, 
amphibians — any spe-
cies that depends on in-
sects for food will start to 
die out, and anything that 
eats those animals will 
take losses. The biodiver-
sity of the entire world is 
at stake.
The fact that we’ve 
apparently lost 75 percent 
of insect biomass in less 
than 30 years makes that 
future seem a lot closer 
than anyone would have 
guessed. 
But how accurate is 
the 75 percent ?gure? It’s 
hard to say. This study 
took place in a single 
country, and the measure-
ments weren’t as regular 
as the members would 
have liked. 
Because comprehen-
sive data on insect popu-
lations is so rare, there 
aren’t many datasets from 
other parts of the world to 
compare it to. 
However, the studies 
on bees and butter?ies,  as 
well as smaller-scale stud-
ies in England and 
the U.S., seem to tell a 
similar story.
In light of this data, 
the Krefeld Society has 
immediate plans to make 
sure their data collection 
is as thorough and ac-
curate as possible. They 
plan to install a “biodiver-
sity weather station” that 
can consistently monitor 
the presence of species in 
a nature preserve, with 
seven automated compo-
nents. 
It includes a pollen col-
lector, a ‘sky scanner’ to 
spot birds, bats, and ?y-
ing insects, and a sound 
recorder to listen for frog, 
bird, and insect calls. 
They are also planning to 
continue their traditional 
insect collections at more 
frequent intervals.
Though the exact mag-
nitude of insect popula-
tion decline is uncertain, 
scientists are certain that 
it’s happening. 
While there are strat-
egies that might slow it 
—such as putting restric-
tions on pesticide use — 
“they all require buy-in 
from signi?cant numbers 
of people,” Goulson says. 
“One or two environmen-
talists like me banging on 
isn’t going to do anything. 
We need the majority of 
people on Earth to change 
their ways, and that’s a 
pretty dif?cult thing to 
achieve.”

SPORTS BRIEFS
Women’s Soccer
The eighth-ranked 
Carnegie Mellon women’s 
soccer team dominated play 
against third-ranked Hardin-
Simmons University on 
Saturday, Nov. 18 in the sec-
tional semi?nal of the 2017 
NCAA Division III Women’s 
Soccer Championship but 
were unable to ?nish any of 
its 17 shots, as the Cowgirls 
narrowly defeated the 
Tartans, 1–0.
The Tartans controlled 
possession and stymied the 
potent offensive attack of 
the Cowgirls, which has 
scored 108 goals this year, 
but only one mattered — a 
corner kick toward the net 
that was just over the arms 
of ?rst-year Carolyn Botz in 
the 77th minute. A Cowgirl 
was at the front post and 
prevented Botz from getting 
to the service that curved 
across the line.
The Tartans peppered 
the Cowgirls defense and 
the goalkeeper all game long 
and continued to press for-
ward even after the Cowgirls 
went ahead. In the 87th 
minute, senior Alex Moy 
?red a shot off the crossbar, 
and the goalkeeper saved a 
shot by senior Tori Iatarola 
25 seconds later.
Iatarola and senior Haili 
Adams each put two shots 
on goal while senior Sienna 
Stritter ?red off three shots, 
one of which was just high of 
the goal in the 12th minute.
The Tartans conclude the 
season with a 15–3–2 re-
cord in the program’s sixth 
straight trip to the NCAA 
tournament and fourth 
appearance in the ?nal 16.
Football
The Carnegie Mellon 
football team competed in 
the 2017 Eastern College 
Athletic Conference (ECAC) 
Asa S. Bushnell Bowl and fell 
to the Mules of Muhlenberg 
College, 32–6. The game 
was held on the campus of 
the University of Delaware 
in Newark, DE.
Following an intercep-
tion by Carnegie Mellon 
senior linebacker Sean 
Graff, the Tartans put to-
gether an 11-play, 59-yard 
drive that resulted in a 29-
yard ?eld goal by senior 
Tyler Kohman. Kohman’s 
kick gave the Cardinal and 
Gray a 3-0 lead with 3:29 to 
play in the ?rst quarter.
Muhlenberg took a 7-3 
lead with 2:43 left in the half 
after a 49-yard catch and 
run. The Mules intercepted 
junior quarterback Cline on 
the Tartans’ ?rst play of the 
ensuing possession and took 
over on the Carnegie Mellon 
15-yard line. The Tartans 
defense held the Mules to 
a ?eld goal, as the 24-yard 
boot by made the score 10–3 
with 1:21 on the clock.
With seven minutes to 
play in the third quarter, 
Muhlenberg extended its 
lead to 17–3 with a 2-yard 
run. A 28-yard ?eld goal by 
Kohman with 1:44 to play 
in the third put the score at 
17–6.
The Mules responded 
and pushed their lead to 
23–6 on the next possession. 
A nine-play, 79-yard drive 
was capped off with a 5-yard 
touchdown run at the 12:35 
mark of the fourth quarter. A 
safety by the Mules and an-
other touchdown run, this 
time a 2-yard run, left the

Women’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s basketball team 
picked up its second 20-
plus win of the season on 
Saturday, Nov. 18 when the 
Tartans topped Allegheny 
College, 76–47, in the 
Allegheny Greg Richards 
Memorial Classic. The 
Tartans are now 2–0 for 
the season while the Gators 
move to 1–1.
The Tartans were led 
by sophomore Katharine 
Higgins who had 20 points 
and seven rebounds. Join-
ing Higgins in double-digit 
points was sophomore 
Makayla Filiere with 15 
points and sophomore 
Laurel Pereira with 14.
The Tartans put to-
gether a defensive effort 
that caused 19 turnovers 
and held the Gators to 25.0 
percent shooting from the 
?eld. Higgins had three of 
the team’s ten steals and the 
Tartans scored 21 points off 
of 19 turnovers.
Higgins, who shot 42.9 
percent from the ?oor, 
opened the game with one 
of her two three-pointers 
for the game. The Gators 
then went on a 14–0 run 
before Filiere hit a jumper 
off an assist by junior Jenn 
Mayberger with half the pe-
riod still to play. The Tartans 
then ?nished the ?nal ?ve 
minutes with an 11–6 run 
that they extended to 18–6 
through the ?rst 4:48 of the 
second period.
While the Gators shot 
64.3 percent in the ?rst pe-
riod, they went cold in the 
second, hitting just one of 13 
from the ?oor and scoring 
just ?ve points. The Tartans 
hit seven ?eld goals and shot 
41.2 percent from the ?oor 
to lead 35–25 at the break.
The Gators would score 
the ?rst four points of the 
second half to pull within 
six points but the Tartans 
answered with a 15–0 run 
that began with a layup by 
sophomore Laura Ochsner. 
The run put the Tartans up 
50–29 with 4:34 to go in the 
third period.
The Tartans continued 
to add to their lead, which 
topped out at 32 when ?rst-
year Kylie Huffman drained 
the team’s eighth three-
pointer of the game with 
1:46 to play in the game.
Mayberger collected six 
assists and seven rebounds 
in the game while playing 37 
minutes, as Ochsner scored 
seven points and grabbed 
nine rebounds to lead the 
team.
The Tartans will contin-
ue their season on the road 
Tuesday, Nov. 21 at Bethany 
College at 4:00 p.m.

Fantasy football: playoff picture coming into focus
Men’s basketball loses to La Roche in home opener
MARIKA YANG
Assistant Sports Editor
This week, I’m back to re-
cap week ten of The Tartan’s 
fantasy football league. I’m 
?lling in for staffwriter 
Josh Andah, who scored 
the least number of points 
in the league for the week. 
Save for Andah’s team, all 
?ve of the other competitors 
reached above 100 points. 
Here are the highlights from 
the week:
Third-String Team over Yes 
We Cam 114.5–101
Despite winning this 
week, my team Third-String 
Team’s record of 5–5 trails 
behind Editor-in-Chief 
India Price’s team Yes We 
Cam’s record, which now 
sits at 7–3. Price earned a 
whopping 35.7 points from 
Carolina Panthers quarter-
back Cam Newton, by far 
his best week this season. 
Despite Minnesota Vikings 
wide receiver Stefon Diggs’s 
17.8 points off of 4 catches, 
78 yards, and a touchdown, 
and a solid 15.2 points 
from Miami Dolphins wide 
receiver Jarvis Landry (5 
catches, 42 yards, and a 
touchdown), Price’s team 
was derailed by earning 
only 0.3 points from Atlanta 
Falcons running back 
Devonta Freeman before 
he left his game due to a 
concussion.
My running back, the 
Chicago Bears’ Tarik Cohen, 
also let me down with only 
2.1 points, but I managed 
to get the win this week 
due to great performances 
from Cincinnati Bengals 
wide receiver A.J. Green 
(22.5 points) and New 
York Giants tight end Evan 
Engram (15.1 points). The 
Los Angeles Rams defense 
also showed up, adding 16 
points.
Drop it like it’s Crock over 
Team Andah 161.9–56.2
Publisher Jade Crockem 
predicted correctly in her 
recap last week that she 
would get the win over 
Andah. New Orleans Saints 
running back Mark Ingram 
had his best week of the 
season with 131 yards on 
21 carries and three touch-
downs, totaling 31.1 points 
for Crockem. Wide receivers 
Adam Thielen of the Vikings 
and Larry Fitzgerald of the 
Arizona Cardinals also per-
formed well for Crockem, 
with 30.6 points and 21.3 
points, respectively.
Crockem didn’t need 
so many players from her 
lineup to perform as well as 
they did because two play-
ers in Andah’s lineup were 
on their bye weeks, one is 
on injured reserve, and an-
other served a suspension 
during the week. Of the re-
maining ?ve players, three 
contributed fewer than 
ten points apiece. In past 
weeks, Andah’s completely 
hands-off approach (read: 
auto-drafting and never 
adjusting his lineup) has 
worked to his advantage, 
but this week it failed him.
Easy Breesy over Justin 
Tucker Must (not) Die 
131.5–127.3
In the closest matchup 
of the week, Sports Editor 
Ian Tanaya topped contrib-
uting editor Lula Beresford 
to stand at the top of the 
standings next to Price’s 
team. Tanaya’s team had 
a great week across the 
board, but the performanc-
es from two of his running 
backs helped him pull past 
Beresford. Saints running 
back Alvin Kamara earned 
24.8 points from 106 yards 
off 12 carries and a touch-
down. Tennessee Titans 
running back DeMarco 
Murray returned to form, 
scoring two touchdowns 
and adding 29.2 points for 
Tanaya’s team.
Beresford’s team, for the 
most part, also had a great 
week, with New England 
Patriots quarterback Tom 
Brady scoring 22.6 points, 
Saints wide receiver 
Michael Thomas with 20.7 
points, Panthers running 
back Christian McCafferty 
adding 20 points, and the 
Ram’s Greg Zuerlein kick-
ing his way to 17 points. 
The Denver Broncos de-
fense was the only member 
of her lineup that had a sig-
ni?cantly bad week, with 
negative three points.
Next week, we have the 
top two teams Yes We Cam 
and Easy Breesy facing off. 
Despite Team Andah’s poor 
showing this past week, 
I predict it will rebound 
against Justin Tucker Must 
(not) Die; the last time the 
teams played each other 
they tied. The ?nal match-
up is my team versus Drop it 
like it’s Crock, which stands 
in my way to getting above 
.500 for the ?rst time.

The men’s basketball 
team opened the season 
at home against La Roche 
College on Friday night, 
falling 71–64.
Three Tartans turned in 
11-point performances as 
senior guard Ryan Maha, 
junior forward and guard 
Seth Henry, and sophomore 
guard Colin McNeil led the 
team, which shot 43.9 per-
cent from the ?oor. The 
Tartans held the Redhawks 
to a 36.4 percent effort 
from the ?oor but were out-
rebounded 53–31. Maha 
dished out ?ve assists, tying 
his career high.
First-year guard Zach 
Watson made his ?rst shot 
of the game, a three-point-
er, to put the Tartans up 
9–6 before a three-pointer 
by the Redhawks tied the 
game with 12:49 to play in 
the ?rst half. The Tartans 
then scored nine straight 
points over a two-minute 
span to take an 18–9 lead. 
First-year forward Daniel 
Weiss hit a three-pointer at 
the end of the run.
The Redhawks went on 
an 11–1 run to take the lead 
at 20–19 with seven min-
utes to play in the half. The 
lead changed hands four 
times before the half ended 
with the Redhawks leading 
28–26.
Henry hit the open-
ing bucket of the second 
half to tie the game for the 
sixth time before McNeil 
converted a layup to give 
the Tartans back the lead, 
30–28. The teams traded 
buckets until the Redhawks 
took the lead for good on a 
three-pointer with 10:04 
to play in the game. That 
three-pointer broke up the 
12th tie of the contest and 
sparked a 9–2 run that put 
the visitors ahead 53–46.
The Tartans pulled to 
within one point after a 
layup by sophomore for-
ward Trent Suddeth and a 
layup by McNeil with 2:33 
to play but the Redhawks 
scored on a jumper in the 
paint and the Redhawks hit 
6-of-8 from the line to keep 
the lead and win by seven.
The Tartans will next 
face Bethany College on 
Tuesday, Nov. 21 at 6 p.m.
Women’s basketball takes season opener in blowout
IAN TANAYA
Sports Editor
The women’s basketball 
team opened the season 
with a 75–47 victory against 
Fredonia State University of 
New York at the Allegheny 
College Greg Richards 
Memorial Classic on Friday.
Leading the Tartans was 
sophomore guard Laurel 
Pereira with a career-best 
20 points. Sophomore 
forward Katharine Higgins 
and sophomore guard 
Makayla Filiere also scored 
in the double digits with 15 
points apiece while ?rst-
year forward Kylie Huffman 
put in 11 points in her ?rst 
outing in a Tartan uni-
form. Higgins also pulled 
down ten rebounds for her 
?rst double-double of the 
season, tying her career 
best in the category. Filiere 
grabbed a career-best sev-
en boards and Pereira tied 
her career-best with ?ve 
rebounds.
The Tartans led 23–10 
after the ?rst quarter behind 
nine points from Pereira. 
The sophomore guard put 
in seven straight during 
the quarter for the Tartans, 
who held the Blue Devils to 
no points for the ?rst three 
minutes of the game.
Higgins hit the last bas-
ket of the quarter for the 
Tartans and opened the 
second with another bucket 
on her way to 10 ?rst-half 
points. The Tartans ex-
tended their 13-point ?rst-
quarter lead to a 19-point 
lead by the break, leading 
40–21 at halftime.
Filiere owned the third 
quarter for the Tartans, 
converting two buckets and 
a free throw for ?ve of the 
team’s 12 points.
The Tartans then hit 
nine shots and four free 
throws in the fourth quar-
ter to ?nish the game with 
the 23-point win. Huffman 
scored nine points in the ?-
nal period with sophomore 
forward Laura Oschner put-
ting in four points.
The Tartans assisted 
on 12 of their 30 baskets 
and shot 40.5 percent from 
the ?oor while holding the 
Blue Devils to 28.1 percent 
shooting from the ?eld.
After a 76–47 victory 
over Allegheny College on 
Saturday, the Tartans will 
next face Bethany College 
on Tuesday, Nov. 21.
Ultimate Frisbee cultivates community, competition
KATE LISTON
Staffwriter
“The spirit of the game, 
I don’t know if I’ve em-
phasized it enough,” said 
Masters Material Science 
student and co-captain 
of the Women’s Ultimate 
Frisbee team Marissa 
Schwartz regarding what 
draws her to Ultimate 
Frisbee.
Ultimate Frisbee isn’t 
your ‘typical’ sport: as a mix-
ture between basketball, 
football, and soccer, it in-
volves athleticism, yes, but 
forces team members to 
form close bonds with each 
other in order to properly 
regulate the team. This ide-
ology makes the team will-
ing to welcome anyone who 
can adapt the proper spirit.
“For people who have 
never even run in their 
life, we welcome them into 
the sport. For people who 
have been playing for many 
years, we welcome them, as 
well,” said Schwartz. “It’s 
really a hard balance some-
times between skill levels, 
but the community and the 
friendships that you build 
when you’re playing Frisbee 
is something that has been 
a huge aspect of the team.”
Ultimate Frisbee plays all 
year long, but their primary 
season is in the spring. In 
the fall they only play three 
tournaments, which count 
towards their record but 
don’t factor into whether 
they go to regionals, and in 
the winter they play pickup 
games with high-school to 
middle-aged teams. Their 
spring tournaments decide 
whether they will go to the 
sectional, regional, or na-
tional competitions.
The men’s and women’s 
teams are, for the most part, 
very similar other than their 
season goals. The men’s 
team is a bit more competi-
tive and strictly adhere to 
the practice schedule more 
than the women’s. They 
have enough members to 
split into an A team and a 
B team, which allows the A 
team to be more competi-
tive while the B works on 
their skills.
The women’s team, on 
the other hand, focuses 
more on the spirit of the 
game. Once Schwartz took 
on the position of being co-
captain during sophomore 
year of her undergraduate 
degree here, she decided 
the team should be less fo-
cused on competition to 
make them more welcom-
ing to new players; she 
encourages this through 
team dinners, outings to 
landmarks such as Niagara 
Falls after tournaments, 
and events such as pump-
kin carving. She wanted ev-
ery player to feel as though 
practice was a nice break in 
their day.
“[It was a] ‘let’s really 
try to win games and win 
tournaments and show that 
Carnegie Mellon isn’t just a 
nerd school’ kind of thing, 
and I think that approach 
wasn’t conducive to build-
ing a team in general. A lot 
of our efforts are to focus 
less on winning and being 
competitive and more on 
the fun, positive aspects of 
playing a sport.”
The importance of bond-
ing between team mem-
bers stems from the fact 
that there are no referees 
in Ultimate Frisbee. This 
makes communication and 
“the spirit of the game” 
crucial for success. When 
there is a foul, the players 
are expected to call it them-
selves, and the two teams 
on the ?eld discuss who 
is penalized and what the 
penalty will be.
“Teams should honor the 
rules. To gain an advantage 
they shouldn’t disagree 
even though they are 
incorrect in disagreeing,” 
said Schwartz.
Schwartz says getting 
involved with the team is 
as easy as emailing one of 
the four captains: Justin 
Abel, Foster Boales, Shani 
Rosenthal, or herself. Af-
ter that, one only needs to 
attend as many practices 
as possible, buy a pair of 
cleats, and have fun with 
the other members.
Ultimate Frisbee may 
not be a sport that is partic-
ularly prominent in popular 
culture, but the club team 
here at Carnegie Mellon 
knows its value and has 
found it to be a crucial part 
of their college experience.

On saying no
Hey Ruth!
Last week you wrote about ways to talk to your 
family about your major, which is great, but what 
about, like, everything else?
What I mean is — I find holidays with family 
exhausting. Don’t get me wrong, I love seeing 
everyone and celebrating, and the excuse to do 
nothing all day is amazing, but in reality, I don’t 
actually end up doing “nothing.” My aunts and 
uncles are always asking me to watch my younger 
cousins and I just cannot be responsible for six 
different kids, even if I am related to all of them.
I’m also finding more and more as I grow up, 
that being at the level of holiday cheerfulness 
and engagement that’s expected of me is getting 
more difficult. I don’t know if I could be around 
anyone for eight hours straight and be up for a 
conversation about my/their life at any point. 
I don’t think I’m a Grinch or anything, but 
sometimes I just want to take a break.
Quit the Useless, Intrusive, Endless Talking. People 
Like Silence. 
Dear QUIET PLS ,
The good news is that you’re definitely not a 
Grinch. Well, you might be, but not because of 
this. Trust me when I say it’s a nearly universal 
experience to get sick of your relatives during 
holiday visits. Just look at every holiday comedy 
ever made. I do recognize that knowing that 
everyone else is suffering with you is less useful 
as a practical solution, though I find it emotionally 
helpful, so let’s talk about how to tell people “no.” 
Because that is, ultimately, what you’re going to 
have to do.
It can be extremely difficult to say no in this 
kind of situation. We’re more or less trained to 
automatically love our family because they’re 
blood, and as any such indication of disagreement 
or declining what they’ve asked of you can 
be read as impolite or rude. And when you’re 
already trying to mediate between these people 
who you do love, but can definitely get on each 
other’s nerves, one little “no” can feel like the 
breaking point. Maybe it’s not your responsibility 
to make sure everything goes well when people 
are visiting, but it’s just much easier to deal with 
all of it than have everyone explode, right?
Is it, though? You sound as if acquiescing to 
everyone’s requests is already beating you and 
your level of enjoyment down. But it’s only every 
so often, and dealing with the fallout would be 
so much worse, maybe. I honestly don’t know 
— you’re the only one who can judge yourself 
and your family situation. But part of growing up 
is learning how to set boundaries and actually 
enforce them, so I’m generally in support of 
saying “no” even when you’re not sure how it will 
go. And honestly? If your relatives are the type of 
people to explode the moment you don’t agree 
to everything they ask, I think you should start 
learning how to say “no” real soon.
If the hard, blunt “no” is still intimidating, I’d 
recommend building in a way to give a “soft no” 
if needed. Basically, find something that will give 
you a way out of babysitting or conversation 
without explicitly turning someone down. Go 
help in the kitchen, or have work you need to do 
(don’t we all), or even just go for a walk. I’m sure 
it gets just as stuffy at your house as it does at 
mine, and going out by yourself or with a family 
member whose company you know you enjoy is 
a good way to get a break and clear your head. 
You can’t be full of holiday cheer if you’re full of 
frustration, so take care of yourself.
Have a wonderful time of the year,

Sinead Foley | Pillbox EditorBar Buddies: The Church Brew Works
A literal altar to beer
I love churches. The history, the architecture, the 
stained glass, the ambiance. What can I say, I’m 
a bit obsessed. So when I found out there was a 
microbrewery in a former Catholic Church, it was 
only a matter of time before I ended up grabbing 
a drink at The Church Brew Works.
The location: Situated between Polish Hill and 
Lawrenceville, Church Brew Works is a bit of a 
hike from campus. The 54 from Craig St. and 
Winthrop St. is your best bet, or a combination of 
the 61B and 87 or 71 and 86. Once you’re finally 
there, there’s plenty to do. The church is on Liberty 
Ave., so the restaurants and bars of Penn Ave. are 
a short walk away.
The drinks: I don’t like beer, so a microbrewery 
was a bit of a weird move for me. But it paid off 
big time. We tried two of their seasonal draft 
beers: Count Dankula and Oats McOats. Count 
Dankula is a bright red color that earns its name. 
Oats McOats is a beer for beer haters like me. 
It has a smooth, hoppy taste that means business 
but isn’t too bitter. They also have a couple more 
seasonal offerings, including a spiced Christmas 
Ale and a Jack Skellington Imp Pumpkin Stout if 
you’re not ready to let go of the Halloween spirit 
and jump on the Christmas bandwagon just yet.
The bar also has food offerings and a restaurant 
section on one side of the aisle if you’re feeling 
a bit more upscale. However, the food prices 
are steep, more in a parent’s budget than a 
college student’s. 
The vibe: The vibe very much depends on 
how you feel about having a bar in a church 
because it most definitely is a church. The Church 
Brew Works team isn’t shy about the somewhat 
sacrilegious nature of their endeavor. Core draft 
brews include Celestial Gold and Pious Monk 
Dunkel, and the first thing you see when you walk 
in are massive steel and copper tanks for beer 
brewing on the high altar.
However, there is no denying that the space is 
gorgeous, and it was abandoned for three years 
and in disrepair before the Church Brew Works 
owners restored it in 1996. Now, the beautiful 
architecture is being maintained and the history 
of the parish is being remembered, so something 
good came of the conversion. 
The Church Brew Works is hardly a rowdy 
nightclub full of hedonistic sin (luckily there are 
plenty of other places for that in Pittsburgh). The 
crowd is older, and the vibe is quiet and relaxed. 
It’s the kind of place where you grab a quality 
beer with a friend or two.
Lit or Nah: I am going to go with Nah. It doesn’t 
have the energy to be a place to start or end a 
night out, and it’s too far and too gimmicky to be 
a comfortable, neighborhood bar for a weeknight 
drink with a friend. It’s worth a visit at least once 
for the good beer and the experience, but I’d say 
once is enough unless you’re a beer fanatic.

Michelle Madlansacay | StaffwriterLIGHT UPNIGHT
It’s never too early to get into the holiday spirit. 
The city of Pittsburgh makes that clear every year 
when it hosts Comcast Light Up Night. During Light 
Up Night, all of downtown is decorated with beau-
tiful lights and Christmas trees, Market Square is 
transformed into a little holiday-themed village, and 
live musical performances take place down by the 
bridges. 
It’s a wonderful event to attend with friends and 
family that will definitely help set the mood for the 
holidays. If you’re planning on attending Light Up 
Night in the coming years, I have a few tips on how 
to make the most of your experience, since this was 
my second time going:
Check the schedule of events ahead of time
Starting at 11:30 a.m., different holiday-themed 
events take place all over downtown Pittsburgh. 
You’ll usually find the tree-lighting ceremonies occur 
in the morning, while all the live musical  
performances and fireworks happen at night. 
Downtown can get really crowded on this day, mak-
ing it a bit difficult to navigate through the city. It’ll 
make things a lot easier for you if you know all the 
event locations and how much time it takes to get 
from one place to the next.
Dress warm for the weather
Nobody really knows what to expect when it comes 
to Pittsburgh weather. However, in my Light Up 
Night experiences, it has been pretty cold both 
years. Wearing a big jacket, scarf, hat (they usually 
give out Santa hats, but they won’t keep you very 
warm), and comfortable shoes is ideal.
Book a reservation for a restaurant down-
town way in advance, or eat before going
Almost every restaurant my friends and I passed 
by was packed. We made reservations to Sienna 
Mercato about a week before Light Up Night, so 
we were able to eat there. But even when we were 
making the reservations, we saw that many other 
restaurants were already booked, so be sure to 
reserve spots about two to three weeks in advance. 
Generally, I find most food places downtown to be 
pricier, so eating at home or somewhere else before-
hand isn’t a bad idea either.
Find some time for ice skating
Every year around this time, PPG Place opens their 
ice skating rink to the public, where people can 
skate around a giant Christmas tree. It doesn’t cost 
too much, and it’s a great opportunity for you and 
your friends to have fun and possibly try something 
new. If you decide to go skating, I do warn you to 
wear long socks because deep ankle blisters are 
definitely not fun to have.
Embrace spontaneity
Not knowing what to expect during Light Up Night 
can result in a very fulfilling experience. Although 
planning your trip ahead of time can make things 
more convenient for you as you explore the city, the 
spontaneity can add a lot of excitement. 
For example, my friends and I knew that singer 
Andy Grammer was performing this year, we just 
didn’t know where and at what time. As we were 
walking downtown, we began to hear him singing 
his song “Honey, I’m Good.” My friends and I fol-
lowed the sound of his voice and ran to the area 
where he was performing. We even got great spots 
to take pictures of him on stage. Generally, when it 
comes to Light Up Night in Pittsburgh, there’s really 
no harm in not knowing what’s going on and where 
things are all happening. The downtown area isn’t 
too big, so it’s not too hard to locate certain events. 
Just being in the center of all the Pittsburgh holiday 
excitement makes a very worthwhile experience.

Fleshy pomegranate carcasses and a shrine to a 
breast-shaped void are the centerpieces of under-
graduate artist Darya Kharabi’s solo show No 
Different from Your Other at Carnegie Mellon’s 
Ellis Gallery. Playing with the sacred, damned, and 
macabre, Kharabi’s work explores the dark history 
of women and medicine. Matter-of-fact recordings 
of dehumanizing and horrifying past treatments for 
breast cancer are paired with drawings and paint-
ings that line the walls of the gallery.
No Different from Your Other is a beautiful show 
that marries research and various mediums to cre-
ate a complex yet clear story about women in 
history. Without being didactic, the show brought 
to light these tragic and horrifying pieces of medi-
cal history. Kharabi writes about historic practices 
of mastectomies before the science was where it 
is today — the insertion of hooks and the severing 
of nerves allude to the tendency of medicine to 
ignore women’s voices as patients. Using a color 
palette of fleshy pinks, burgundy reds, and sickly 
greens, these surrealist pieces combine imagery 
and text from medical journals with heavily styl-
ized figurative drawing that build a chronology of 
instances in the history of treating, or not treating, 
breast cancer.
The show is also successful in its contradictions. 
On the one hand, this show is a space to hold the 
pain of women throughout history. Yet on the other, 
despite this fact, the show leans into the dehuman-
izing nature of medical practices. There are no 
identifiable women subjects of this story, the draw-
ings of women, although beautiful and intricate, 
either allude to physiological diagrams or display 
an abstracted and distorted woman. The absence 
of an overt female subject emphasizes the invisibil-
ity of women in medical literature, but these figures 
keep the viewer grounded in the perspective of a 
female narrator.
The narrative Kharabi presents is clearly from a 
clinical perspective but is also contextualized by 
heavy religious references. The pomegranates and 
grapefruits reference the fall of Eve but also the 
human body; the entire show is set up like a holy 
space. The relationship of science, medicine, and 
religion is complex, and we see the lasting effects 
of that even today in our system for women’s 
healthcare. The confusion of untangling the rela-
tionship between these institutions with body politics 
and self-perception is central to Kharabi’s work. In 
some of the pieces, the role of religiosity enshrines 
misogyny and negligence in the medical fields. In 
others, however, it turns the unnamed woman into 
martyrs and provides the basis for the pieces that 
allude to the reclamation of the female body.
A black form shaped like a bullet or a breast 
appears as a monolith in several of the pieces. 
It works as a void that represents perhaps the 
breast or its removal, as well as the removal of the 
agency of women around their own bodies in these 
cultural and medical spaces. It is the centerpiece of 
the show. A wreath of twigs turns the absence of 
women from medical knowledge into a holy trag-
edy. The void of the monolith and the holy space 
of the entire show allows for a space to grieve for 
the women who suffered for the sake of science. 
This show’s source of power is the pairing of sad-
ness with rage. Most present in the final piece that 
contains a poem sentencing an unknown other 
“enrobed in [their] own ignorance” to hell, these 
works are also a direct expression of anger.
This past year, news outlets from Teen Vogue to 
the New York Times have become hyper-aware of 
women’s anger, claiming that we as a society have 
never seen women become so publicly angry as 
they are right now. In the past month alone, with 
the slew of sexual harassment charges and attacks 
on women’s health care, has been a trying time for 
women. We’ve also seen the ways women have 
learned how to channel and express anger in a cul-
ture that teaches women that they aren’t allowed to 
hold this emotion. In No Different from Your Other, 
we see the exploration of a specific piece of scien-
tific history built into our cultural understanding of 
women and their bodies with pieces that work frus-
tration and pain in academic and artistic language. 
Given this broader social context, the work of art-
ists like Kharabi are important and brave.
It is, therefore, also important that we listen to 
the women speaking out about injustice in their 
lives and our world. Often, the changes we see 
in the world come from youth culture and college 
campuses. And so, although the Ellis Gallery may 
feel separate from the professionalism of formal 
galleries, it is vital that we take participate and 
consume the expression of young artists on college 
campuses. The most important takeaway from these 
articles is that our student artists are preserving 
the values and questions our students are holding 
about our society, and will ultimately determine 
what direction progress is pushed towards. Keep 
an eye out for the work of Kharabi and the artists 
working in these spaces — their voices are a force 
to be reckoned with.

Compos-it Opera

Students Premiere Original Operas
Compos-it Opera, a collaborative showcase of 
original student work, premiered two new operas 
last Friday in the Cohon Center Studio Theatre.  
 
The evening of performances began with Bowl of 
Small Hands, an expressionist exploration of a tor-
mented young woman seeking refuge. Senior BHA 
student in music technology and technical writing 
Joshua Brown wrote and composed the opera as 
part of his capstone, a cumulative project that BXA 
students complete during their senior year. 
Jacqueline Tardanico (CFA ’18) exhibited raw  
emotion in the role of Cherry, a woman who real-
izes “the boundaries between what is real and 
what is not... are becoming porous.” Visually 
compelling set design by sophomore drama major 
Katherine Sharpless, paired with Brown’s mesmer-
izing orchestrations, placed the audience directly 
in Cherry’s mind, while stage direction by sopho-
more drama major Rachel Pospisil effectively used  
movement to show the control exercised by 
Cherry’s inner demons.

The next performance was Suburban Mompera, a contemporary take on the 
classical Faustian narrative. This was the first composition by senior music major 
Russel H. Holbert, who wrote the score that underlies Brown’s libretto. 
The audience was fully engaged with Suburban Mompera from the start, when 
housewives Pam, Shelby, and Mindy reveal their longing for a life beyond 
mommy blogs and PTA meetings. The opera successfully blended comedy and 
emotion, weaving hilarious one-liners with fully-realized backstories and excel-
lent characterization. 
Holbert created the opera as part of his requirements for Fifth Year Scholars, 
a university-sponsored fellowship that funds an additional year of study for 
students who wish to launch impactful projects on campus. Holbert hoped 
Compos-it Opera would provide the Carnegie Mellon community with music “by 
the students, for the students” and expose the audience to contemporary opera. 
Overall, the team behind Compos-it Opera admirably took risks and forged 
partnerships from all corners of the university. “If there’s something I know how 
to do, it’s start something I don’t know how to do,” said Brown.  
 
“Throughout the process, there was a lot of magic and luck.” Holbert and Brown 
clearly have a strong collaborative relationship and Compos-it Opera promises 
continued growth and achievement in any future work they may embark on.

Juliana Schnerr | StaffwriterIsabel Allende
Lisa Qian| Staff Artist

---------------------------------------------------

Few authors have had as global an impact as 
Isabel Allende, a writer with over 20 works 
published in 30 languages. Not only do 
Allende’s works reach a global audience, but 
they also appeal to universal human experi-
ences and emotions. A distinguished writer 
and speaker, she made a perfect addition to 
Pittsburgh Arts and Lectures’ Ten Evenings, 
a series of author lectures meant to “create 
community through the literary arts.” As in 
her writing, Allende shared valuable and 
heartfelt lessons during her talk at Carnegie 
Music Hall. These lessons covered how to be 
a better writer, American citizen, and person 
overall. Through dialogue, Allende honestly 
divulged her thoughts on political controversies, 
the refugee experience, the necessity of grief, 
and the joy of falling in love no matter one’s 
age. Intelligent, charming, and bitingly funny, 
Allende is the elegant mentor we’ve all been 
looking for.
While Allende spoke on many subjects, this 
particular visit to Pittsburgh was in support of 
her new novel, In the Midst of Winter. The 
novel follows a group of three individuals who, 
through a chance encounter, are brought out 
of their personal traumas and into the light. 
After undergoing a divorce and a series of 
tragedies herself, including the deaths of vari-
ous friends, her agent, and her beloved dog, 
Allende found herself feeling as though “noth-
ing good was ever going to happen.” In the 
midst of that sorrowful period, she discovered 
a quote by Albert Camus that reads, “in the 
midst of winter, I found there was, within me, 
an invincible summer.” And thus, Allende 
began to write in hopes that she and her char-
acters would make it through the long, cold 
winter to their invincible summers.
The characters are clearly informed by 
Allende’s own experiences, in particular, 
the story of Evelyn Ortega, a Guatemalan 
immigrant fleeing a violent past. Allende is 
deeply familiar with the political turmoil of 
Latin America and its impact on daily life. She 
herself fled Chile following the coup in 1973 
and has a deep understanding of life as an 
immigrant. She is also involved in the work of 
the Isabel Allende Foundation, an organization 
that strives to end violence towards and exploi-
tation of women and girls. Many women who 
receive aid from the foundation have shared 
their stories with Allende, and one such story 
became the inspiration for Evelyn’s journey.
As for the other two characters, Lucia and 
Richard, their story depicts the experience of 
falling in love at an older age. A romance 
between older characters is rare in popular 
literature, but the idea of finding love and 
expressing one’s sexuality later in life is very 
important to Allende. New love has recently 
made its way into Allende’s life, in the form 
of an email correspondence with a man who 
reached out to the author after hearing her on 
a radio show. On their first date, (which hap-
pened after five months of emailing each other 
every day) Allende didn’t hold back in asking, 
“What are your intentions? I’m 74 years old, I 
don’t have time to waste!”
It was with this same frankness and intensity 
that Allende approached audience questions 
submitted later in the night. Questions ranged 
from, “How do you stay so beautiful?” (to 
which Allende laughingly replied, “money”) to 
more serious questions such as, “How can we 
solve the refugee crises going on all over the 
world?” While Allende openly admitted she 
did not have a final answer for such a complex 
problem, she offered what insight she could. 
She urged audience members to look at each 
statistic related to immigration and refugees not 
as a number but as a person with a name and 
a story. Allende believes we need to make an 
effort to understand the reasons people have 
for leaving and recognize both how difficult it 
is to leave one’s home and how perilous that 
journey to a new place can be. “It’s not about 
building a wall,“ said Allende. “It’s about sup-
porting efforts to improve conditions in coun-
tries of origin. It’s about understanding that no 
one wants to leave their home and that we are 
all people.”
Allende then went on to share her writing 
wisdom. The question, “Does everyone have 
a story?” led to some interesting truths about 
both fiction and real life. While the author 
admitted that some people are in fact, boring, 
it’s all about the way you tell that person’s 
story. On the other end of the spectrum, 
Allende admitted that sometimes you have to 
water down reality instead of building it up. 
According to Allende, “the first duty of a fic-
tion writer is to trap the reader,” but sometimes 
reality is too horrific to keep a reader invested 
and the truth must be diluted into something 
more manageable.
Allende is no stranger to hard times and hard 
truths. She has experienced two divorces, the 
loss of her daughter, years of displacement 
and many other trials. Through her work, she 
has encountered individuals with truly heart-
breaking stories and unimaginable losses, 
and as a writer, she carries those stories with 
her always. Allende speaks with the kind of 
confidence and omniscience that can only 
come from knowing the pain and making it 
through to the other side. When the audience 
addressed Allende’s life experiences, she was 
not afraid to acknowledge them. In fact, she 
announced that each negative and painful 
event in our lives must be acknowledged and 
they must be lived in order for times of joy to 
be so powerful. Our sorrows and pains are just 
a part of the narrative, but they’re not who the 
characters are. That attitude is what tied the 
entire night together.
The final question of the night asked, “With all 
that’s going on in the world, what gives you 
hope?”
Allende’s response: “Everything. Everything 
gives me hope.”
And there lies the power of Isabel Allende and 
her stories, to push through the pain to find the 
joy, to acknowledge loss to find new love, and 
to wait out the winter until the dawn of that 
invincible summer. s

---------------------------------------------------

Over the past few years, I’ve worked operations for 
Bhangra in the Burgh twice and only seen the show 
in segments, between flapping doors and late- 
arriving spectators. This year, however, I was deter-
mined to grab a seat and really take in the whole 
experience, and boy was it worth it.
Bhangra in the Burgh is a completely student-run 
Bhangra competition hosted by students at Carnegie 
Mellon University. Under the guidance of juniors 
Nandini Radhakrishnan and Isha Laad, who co-
directed this year’s show, a team of more than 20 
executive board members and even more operations 
volunteers took the year to create a truly incred-
ible program. This year’s program benefited the 
Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh Foundation, specifi-
cally their inspiring Creative and Expressive Arts 
Therapy program.
Every year, eight teams arrive to compete for first, 
second, and third place. This year, the eleventh 
iteration of the event, teams hailed from Canada, 
the West Coast, the Tri-State Area, Detroit, North 
Carolina, and, of course, Pittsburgh. The line-up 
this year featured many past champions, such as 
last year’s reigning champs Anakh E Gabroo, from 
the Tri-State Area. The full line up was as follows: 
Anakh E Gabroo (Tri-State Area), Cal Bhangra 
(UC Berkeley), First Class Bhangra (Pittsburgh, PA), 
Furteelay (Detroit, MI), Nachdi Jawani Ankhiley 
(Ontario, Canada), Nachde Shokeen Gabroo (Bay 
Area, CA), UNC Bhangra (UNC Chapel Hill), and 
Royal Academy – Royal Queens (Canada).
Teams were judged on their formations, vadiya 
(attire), mix (music and lights), synchronization, and 
creativity. As a result, every performance was intri-
cately crafted and packed with energy. Of the eight 
teams that performed five were all male and two 
were all female. Each brought an interesting twist to 
the table. While some groups pretended to leave the 
stage, only to come back with an even more exciting 
finale, others climbed on each other’s shoulders and 
brought other dance forms into their Bhangra  
performances. The costumes were bursting with color 
and shimmer, and no dancer graced the stage with-
out the signature Bhangra smile that we’ve come to 
know and love.
Despite a few technical difficulties throughout the 
evening, the show was held together well by the 
emcees, seniors Piyush Puri and Rohan Shah. Both 
Puri and Shah kept the audience chuckling with an 
ongoing gag about the miraculous Vicks Vaporub 
and numerous impromptu dance battles. Constant 
allusions to the “bio-data”-hungry aspect of Indian-
American match-making culture gave both the stu-
dents and parents in the audience a good laugh. 
Other entertainment of the evening included 
Carnegie Mellon’s own all-female south Asian a cap-
pella group, Saans, and Infra Dance Company. The 
University of Pittsburgh’s classical dance troupe, Pitt 
Nrityamala, also took the stage, as did the nine to 
thirteen years olds of the Nandanik Dance Academy. 
The show was, of course, sealed off with a power-
packed performance by CMU Bhangra while the 
judges decided the winner.
While all the teams danced valiantly, there could be 
only three winners. Here was the final decision:
Winners:
1. Nachde Shokeen Gabroo (Bay Area, CA)
2. First Class Bhangra (Pittsburgh, PA)
3. Anakh E Gabroo (Tri-State Area)

Instead of the usual lectures, Friday night found Doherty Hall full 
of song. One of Carnegie Mellon’s a cappella groups, C#, hosted 
their annual Harvest Concert, featuring the C# singers as well 
as performances by C#’s sister choral group Db and Carnegie 
Mellon’s Christian a cappella group Joyful Noise. It also provided 
a platform for soloist performances from group members and 
unafiliated singers, bringing people together from across campus. 
Editor’s Note: Julianne Sanscartier, a member of Db, is Comics Editor for The Tartan.
