Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity President Subra Suresh 
took center stage last Wednes-
day at a town hall event to ad-
dress questions and concerns 
from the Carnegie Mellon 
community. A crowd of most-
ly faculty and administrative 
staff gathered in McConomy 
Auditorium to hear Suresh’s 
ideas about the future of the 
university, its costs, academ-
ics, and culture.
Carnegie Mellon’s Vice 
President of Communications 
and Marketing Steve Kloehn 
guided the discussion, and 
select faculty, staff, and stu-
dents were asked to share 
their questions. Kloehn also 
included questions which had 
been previously submitted 
online.
M. Shernell Smith, the as-
sistant director of student af-
fairs, posed the ?rst question: 
“How do you see staff engage-
ment as a part of the transfor-
mative CMU experience? And 
what do you say to those staff 
members who don’t always 
feel like they are at the table 
for some of those particular 
dialogues?” she asked.
Suresh named his strate-
gic plan initiative, town hall 
meetings, email solicitations, 
and more as ways that his ad-
ministration has engaged the 
Carnegie Mellon community. 
Suresh said he’s been pleased 
with the community’s “un-
precedented strategic plan-
ning,” and suggested that he 
wants his strategic plan to be 
a thoroughly dynamic and 
collaborative project.
When a computer science 
student asked online wheth-
er there was a downside to 
the Computer Science de-
partment’s growing number 
of corporate partnerships, 
Suresh responded reassuring-
ly. For Suresh, companies like 
Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft 
want to have close relation-
ships with the School of Com-
puter Science because of the 
student and faculty’s work. 
He cited Tata Consultancy 
Service’s recent $35 million 
donation to Carnegie Mellon 
as an example of this support 
for student’s work.
Since the Computer Sci-
ence student’s question was 
concerned with how certain 
partnerships could alienate 
competing companies, Suresh 
gave a prime example of 
Carnegie Mellon’s more neu-
tral positioning. “We don’t 
take sides,” he explained. 
“We even work with UPMC 
and Highmark. If you can do 
that, you can do anything...  
There is nothing in these 
partnerships that conveys 
exclusivity.”
Sophomore international 
relations and politics and pol-
icy and management double 
major and Dietrich College 
senator Michael Gormley said 
that he felt “disassociated” 
from Carnegie Mellon’s small-
er campuses in Qatar and 
Rwanda. Suresh noted that 
since the Pittsburgh campus is 
vastly larger than its interna-
tional campuses, the size dis-
parity challenges the process 
of building bridges between 
the communities.

Reaching new HEIGHTS
On Thursday, The Tartan was given a behind-the-scenes tour of the Jared L. Cohon 
University Center expansion construction site. Set to open in May of 2016, the new 
portion of the building will include a state-of-the-art performance theater, a high-
security athletic facility, and perhaps most notable of all, a focal point for the Forbes 
entrance to the university.
The base project, costing about $22 million, is 
a result of years of careful planning, fundraising, 
and an effort to expand the athletics program at 
Carnegie Mellon, according to Adam Homer, the 
campus design and facility development project 
manager for the CUC expansion, who led portions 
of the tour. The tour was focused on the athletic 
facilities, the theater, the campus entry point, and 
the third ?oor space.
Athletic Facilities
Assistant Director of Athletics, Recreational 
Programming Sara Gauntner was also present 
during the tour, and emphasized how long-await-
ed the improved athletic facilities are. “We’ve 
tried to plan out a one-stop-shop for athletic 
needs on campus,” she said, acknowledging that 
between Skibo Gymnasium and the CUC weight 
rooms, the current facilities are not meeting the 
existing needs.
The Forbes-facing portion of the ?rst ?oor will 
offer strength training with heavy weights, similar 
to the weight room in Skibo Gym. One side of the 
room will cater to heavy lifters, while the other 
will allow for lighter, less strenuous weightlifting. 
Paneled by glass walls and six skylights, the ?rst 
?oor will fully utilize natural light for the conve-
nience of the users. Further back, students will 
have access to 180 new rental lockers, two unisex 
family changing rooms, spacious male and female 
locker rooms, and private showers. On the second 
?oor, there are four multipurpose rooms desig-
nated for various ?tness classes, in addition to a 
cycling room, and, overlooking the weight room, 
a cardio-machine space that has a wall of windows 
looking out to Forbes. Swimmers will also have 
larger team rooms and physical education instruc-
tors will now have classrooms in which to teach.
Director of Student Activities Liz Vaughan said 
that the ?exibility of the spaces was a priority dur-
ing the expansion planning process. “With more 
spaces, we can offer more classes. [Students] will 
be able to ?nd the class that they want to take at a 
time that is convenient for them.”

Chicago-based aeronau-
tics and space engineering 
company Boeing has teamed 
up with Carnegie Mellon to 
create a new lab on campus. 
Of?cially called the Boe-
ing/Carnegie Mellon Aero-
space Analytics Lab, the lab 
is meant to expand Carn-
egie Mellon’s research in 
aerospace, language — and 
a subject quite relevant on 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus, 
—  machine learning.
Having several contracts 
with the federal government, 
Boeing teamed up with Carn-
egie Mellon to utilize the 
school’s expertise in these 
areas. Professor of Computer 
Science and Director of the 
Language Technologies In-
stitute Jaime Carbonell leads 
the team of Carnegie Mellon 
researchers.
Boeing is no stranger to 
Carnegie Mellon, nor to its 
Pittsburgh campus. In fact, 
one of the company’s former 
employees, John Vu, is now 
a professor in language tech-
nologies and computational 
biology. Vu now plays an 
extensive role in coordinat-
ing the relationship between 
the school and the company.
University President Subra 
Suresh has expressed excite-
ment in the role the new lab 
will play. “Researchers from 
Carnegie Mellon and Boeing 
have enjoyed a collaborative 
relationship for more than 
30 years and we’re proud 
of the fact that hundreds of 
our graduates are working at 
Boeing,” Suresh said in a uni-
versity press release.
Chief Information Of?cer 
at Boeing Ted Colbert also 
expressed excitement for the 
project. Describing the lab 
as a one-of-a-kind research 
center, Colbert hoped to see 
it bene?t Boeing’s corporate 
endeavors in the near future. 
“We’re aiming to push the 
technology envelope,” Col-
bert said in the University 
press release. 
“We have the best and the 
brightest faculty at a leading 
institution focused on how 
we can innovate and solve 
business challenges for today 
and into the future.”

CMU engineers add optic sensors to bots
A new type of robotic 
hand made its way into the 
world of robotics through 
the efforts of Carnegie Mel-
lon engineers: a hand with 
optic sensors. The hand has 
?ngers just as a human hand 
does, with 14 separate optic 
sensors, each acting to sense 
the hand’s position relative 
to its surroundings — that is, 
anything touching the sen-
sors with a force of a tenth of 
a newton or greater. 
“If you want robots to 
work autonomously and to 
react safely to unexpected 
forces in everyday environ-
ments, you need robotic 
hands that have more sen-
sors than is typical today,” 
assistant professor of robot-
ics Yong-Lae Park said in 
a university press release. 
These hands also need to 
mimic the human hand. “Hu-
man skin contains thousands 
of tactile sensory units only 
in the ?ngertip and a spider 
has hundreds of mechanore-
ceptors on each leg, but even 
a state-of-the-art humanoid 
such as NASA’s Robonaut 
has only 42 sensors in its 
hand and wrist,” Park added.
Carnegie Mellon re-
searchers are excited about 
this new capability, and pre-
sented it at the 2015 IEEE 
International Conference on 
Intelligent Robots and Sys-
tems (IROS) in Hamburg, 
Germany on Oct. 1.

program, which connects 
Pittsburgh students to Qatar 
students with annual trips 
to the different campuses. 
Student groups like Project 
Rwanda also reach out and 
engage with the other cam-
puses, he said.
On a heavier note, one sub-
mitted question addressed the 
campus sexual assault crisis. 
Suresh applauded the work 
of Dean of Student Affairs 
Gina Casalegno as well as the 
Sexual Violence Prevention 
Program enacted last year in 
combating this issue faced by 
campuses nationwide.
Suresh acknowledged that 
campus sexual assault is a 
“complex, national issue we 
need to address as a communi-
ty. Everyone in the community 
has a role to play, including 
bystanders.” He mentioned 
that upcoming roundtables 
and new programs this year 
will continue to address the 
pressing matter.
Ömer Akin, professor of ar-
chitecture, questioned wheth-
er the university truly sustains 
its commitment to creativity. 
Akin expressed concern for 
?agging support of the Col-
lege of Fine Arts and Dietrich 
College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences, two colleges 
which Akin believes to be cen-
ters of creativity on campus.
Suresh con?rmed that 
his strategic plan will foster 
and support creativity on 
campus. He mentioned that 
both schools were recently 
awarded $1 million “chal-
lenge grants” last year. “Use 
this to support your faculty 
and we would like to see how 
you can grow this,” he told the 
schools. “I’ll be coming back 
to see how they’ve grown it 
before too long.” Suresh also 
believes that the Digital Hu-
manities program should also 
promote Dietrich.
Suresh still believes that 
both schools need to provide a 
clearer idea of what they will 
add to the Forbes Corridor, 
which he hopes will be the 
premier hub of creativity and 
innovation between Silicon 
Valley and the East Coast. “Is it 
backed by reality? Is it backed 
by data? Yes,” he af?rmed.
An undergraduate student 
posed a question concerning 
race, asking how can Carnegie 
Mellon better embrace the 
evolving de?nition of diversi-
ty. President Suresh promised 
dedication to this challenge. 
“We will do everything pos-
sible to attract a diversity of 
student and faculty cohorts,” 
he said.
He used this year’s un-
dergraduate freshman class 
as an example of increasing 
diversity. Although Western 
Pennsylvania is not known for 
attracting the most diverse of 
people, he feels con?dent that 
Carnegie Mellon has the re-
sources to attract people of all 
backgrounds.
Again concerning Carnegie 
Mellon’s diverse student body, 
a graduate student expressed 
frustration over the complicat-
ed visa process that interna-
tional graduate students face 
in the U.S. Suresh, who was 
once an international gradu-
ate student himself, felt that 
Carnegie Mellon needs to ?nd 
sustainable ways to support 
international students who 
must deal with visa policies, 
family issues, and homesick-
ness.
In the past, Suresh has ad-
vocated in front of Congress 
for an easier visa application 
process. Although Carnegie 
Mellon has little in?uence 
with the State Department 
regarding visas, the school 
has helped in cases regarding 
Ph.D. candidates.
Kloehn then announced 
that they had received numer-
ous questions online regard-
ing tuition costs. President 
Suresh framed the dire state 
of rising tuition costs as “the 
cost of education versus the 
investment in education.” He 
compared Carnegie Mellon’s 
slower rates of rising tuition to 
those of other colleges.
Since May 2014, Carn-
egie Mellon’s endowment has 
grown signi?cantly. While 
Carnegie Mellon’s endow-
ment barely stacks up to peer 
institutions’ endowments, he 
said, the school still manages 
to compete on a high level. 
However, he still stressed the 
need to establish a “perma-
nent mechanism to continue 
to help our students.”
Lastly, Suresh discussed 
how technology will impact 
higher education in the years 
to come. He does believe that 
online learning will disrupt 
universities’ ?nancial models, 
yet still sees students wanting 
and needing to be physically 
present on campuses.
Suresh will host his next 
town hall in the spring.

from the reception desk to 
the back wall of the building. 
For security purposes, access 
to all facilities will require 
students to swipe their Carn-
egie Mellon ID, similar to the 
turnstiles near the pool and 
current locker rooms.
The CUC expansion is 
part of a three-phase plan to 
re-imagine athletics and rec-
reation at Carnegie Mellon, 
Gauntner said. “I’ve been 
lucky to be around for two of 
the three phases during my 
time here.” The next part, she 
said, involves slowly shutting 
down Skibo Gymnasium and 
repurposing the space.
Performance Theater
The ?rst ?oor’s key attrac-
tion is the studio theater. The 
theater was built to serve the 
needs of the many student 
groups on campus, and as 
such, has a variety of speci-
?cations that will allow it to 
suit these needs. The ?oor of 
the theater will be ?tted with 
heavy-sprung padding to 
protect the dancers who will 
use it, from Bhangra to Danc-
er’s Symposium. The wall of 
mirrors on one side of the 
theater is also geared toward 
making rehearsals easier for 
such groups.
The acoustic properties of 
the theater will make it ideal 
for musical groups, such as 
the All University Orchestra 
or the Kiltie Band, to prac-
tice. The walls are insulated 
with six inches of foam for 
maximum noise canceling, 
as well as multiple layers of 
thicker drywall and space 
between the layers that will 
make the room virtually 
soundproof, according to 
Homer.
The theater offers many 
options for the staging and 
direction of productions, so 
that sets can be positioned in 
virtually any way. Telescopic 
seating for 140 can be pulled 
out from the wall as far as 
the groups need it to be, or 
groups will also be able to 
take chairs from the roomy 
storage areas surrounding 
the theater to create an in-
the-round theater experi-
ence, said Vaughan.
A balcony with extension 
cables allows performance 
technology to be set up from 
any angle, and sets that are 
constructed in the theater 
can be stored in the rooms on 
the other side of the walls. 
A green room will serve as a 
changing area for dancers or 
performers, which Vaughan 
says will make performing 
in this theater easier than 
performing in the current 
CUC facilities and eliminate 
the need for performers and 
patrons  to share bathrooms.
Campus entry point
According to Mandi Sem-
ple, director of marketing 
for student affairs opera-
tions, the main entrance to 
the CUC expansion will face 
Forbes, and ?nally offer a 
real “front” of campus. The 
CUC expansion project and 
the new Tepper Quadrangle 
will both play into the idea 
of changing the way that 
the university interacts with 
Forbes Avenue, according to 
Vaughan, as well as acting 
as a stronger entry point for 
visitors. “We all saw people 
walk out of the old parking 
garage and looking around 
and getting lost because it 
was so unclear where they 
were supposed to go. Now, 
they will walk down a side-
walk and walk right into the 
new expansion.”
Once inside, visitors will 
be greeted by a large lobby 
meant to function similarly 
to the CUC’s current black 
chairs common space. An 
alumni-donated Dale Chi-
huly sculpture will hang 
overhead against a large, 
two-?oor mural behind the 
main staircase. The design-
ers have planned to create 
rain gardens outside, which 
will complement the 62,000 
square feet of the building’s 
glass and zinc exterior and 
will also serve to separate 
the building from the noise 
and traf?c on Forbes Avenue.
Third ?oor
As many community 
members will remember, the 
design of the CUC yielded 
an extra 4,559 square feet of 
space that was dubbed the 
“shell space” last year. Pur-
chased by the Undergradu-
ate Student Senate and the 
Graduate Student Assembly 
(GSA), the space is divided 
and designated into 3,025 
square feet and 1,534 square 
feet zones for each group, 
respectively. The rooms will 
serve as collaborative space 
for both bodies of students. 
According to Vaughan, the 
rooms will have plenty of 
power outlets, whiteboards, 
and tables. 
This Wednesday, Oct. 7, 
examples of the tentative 
furniture selections for both 
these spaces and the lobby 
will be available for stu-
dents to try and talk about 
in the Kirr Commons in the 
CUC. The design team and 
the Carnegie Mellon project 
coordinators would like to 
hear furnishing options and 
design details that best cater 
to the student body.
The CUC expansion is just 
one part of a larger effort on 
behalf of the Carnegie Mel-
lon administration to face-
lift the campus and meet 
the ever-changing demand 
of students. According to 
Vaughan, tours of the facility 
will continue to be offered to 
a variety of groups over the 
next few months, particular-
ly the groups of students who 
have the greatest stake in the 
new facilities.
Tour sheds light on expansion
The CUC expansion will include new locker rooms and showers for the athletic facilities.

VALENE MEZMIN
Assistant News Editor
Jane Austen has been part 
of the literary canon for cen-
turies. Pride and Prejudice, 
Sense and Sensibility, Emma, 
and Persuasion, to name a few, 
are novels that lived long past 
their production in the 1800s 
and continue to garner a wide-
spread fan base that still reads 
and glori?es these novels to 
this very day. 
“Janeites”, as her more 
devoted fans are called, can 
be found in many parts of the 
world, reading, analyzing, and 
imagining the works of Ms. 
Austen.
Last Thursday, Associate 
Professor of English at the 
University of Texas at Austin 
Janine Barchas, a Janeite her-
self, gave a talk as part of the 
CAS Speaker Series on her use 
of modern technology that 
allows users to travel back to 
1813 and take a step into the 
life of Jane Austen.
“What Jane Saw” is an on-
line digital gallery that allows 
viewers to observe a room-by-
room deconstruction of Sir 
Joshua Reynolds’ paintings 
that Austen visited on May 24, 
1813 at 52 Pall Mall in Lon-
don. Barchas began her talk by 
providing some background 
on her fascination with this 
particular moment in the life 
of Jane Austen.
Janine Barchas is the au-
thor of Matters of Fact in Jane 
Austen, a novel that focuses 
on the celebrity culture of Ms. 
Austen. During her research, 
she came across a letter Austen 
wrote to her sister, Cassandra, 
about the museum exhibitions 
she visited on May 24, 1813. 
The letters describe her 
quest to search for portrait 
representations of her Pride 
and Prejudice characters in 
Sir Reynolds’ paintings. In the 
letter, she describes her suc-
cess at ?nding a painting that 
looked like Mrs. Bingley but 
her inability to hunt down one 
that resembled Mrs. Darcy.
“This was my smoke and 
gun.… She’s looking for Mrs. 
Darcy and Mrs. Bingley,” Bar-
chas said, reliving the feel-
ing of excitement she had 
felt upon ?nding this tidbit 
of information. Austen was 
born into modest beginnings 
and did not interact with the 
social elite of her time. Reyn-
olds’ paintings represented 
these same elite celebrities, 
and Austen, through examin-
ing his works, was able to im-
merse herself in British celeb-
rity culture.
And so the task to recreate 
the exhibit began. Barchas, 
with help from her program-
ming, art, and design students 
at the University of Texas at 
Austin, underwent the task of 
turning her ideas into reality 
— well, virtual reality. 
They underwent the metic-
ulous task of determining the 
exact layout of the pictures, 
?nding the perfect layer of col-
ors that would help date the 
images, and ?guring out the 
perfect lighting. The website 
was created with the use of 
Google SketchUp.
Barchas talks about other 
similar digital heritage proj-
ects that were also released 
around the same time as 
“What Jane Saw.” One of these 
was the Chicago Art Institute’s 
celebration of the 100 year an-
niversary of Jane Austen’s at-
tendance to the Armory Show 
which incorporated black and 
white photographs of the walls 
from that particular show. 
“If Jane Austen had done 
what I wish she had, which 
was to take out her iPhone and 
shoot me some photographs, 
I would’ve had that too,” Bar-
chas said. Barchas created a 
website that allows us to travel 
back in time and view the 
amazing art works that Aus-
ten got to experience so many 
years ago.
Not only did Barchas set 
out to digitally reconstruct the 
highly acclaimed paintings 
of Sir Jonathan Reynolds — 
something that in itself would 
be a great achievement — but 
she wanted to view them spe-
ci?cally through the lens of 
Jane Austen. Over time, her 
initial slideshow of ideas blos-
somed into a fully formed 
website that has been viewed 
by more than 150,000 people 
around the world.
Viewers are able to click 
on the image of each individ-
ual portrait and learn about 
the history of the paintings 
and the people represented 
in them, but also how each 
picture connects back to Jane 
Austen. 
Some of the people in the 
paintings include King Lear, 
Louis Phillipe Joseph, Captain 
John Hamilton, and Emma 
Hamilton, who was, according 
to Barchas, “the Marilyn Mon-
roe of Jane Austen’s time.”
The website has become an 
overwhelming success, even 
deemed as a ?rst in the digital 
humanities. Carnegie Mellon 
Professor Jamie Smith, who 
is currently teaching “Pride 
and Prejudice and Popularity” 
said, “Barchas’s work is bril-
liant in that it combines im-
mersive entertainment (like 
you might experience when 
watching a Jane Austen ?lm) 
with detailed historical accu-
racy and scholarship. Projects 
like these highlight the value 
of digital humanities and can 
provoke new ideas in ?elds 
like cultural studies and per-
formance theory.”
What’s next for Janine 
Barchas? Currently, “What 
Jane Saw” is in the works of 
becoming a 3D interactive vi-
sual tool for viewers to be able 
to simulate the experience of 
embodying Jane Austen as she 
walks through the museum. 
Barchas will also be co-curat-
ing the “Will and Jane: Shake-
speare, Austen, and the Cult of 
Celebrity” exhibit at the Fol-
ger Shakespeare Library with 
Carnegie Mellon’s Professor of 
English Kristina Straub.

Security Report shows CMU’s Title IX ?ght isn’t over
Peduto’s program promises veterans better future
Students should get excited about CUC expansion
Maegha Singh/Assistant Art Editor
Each year, Carnegie Mellon re-
leases the Security and Fire Safety 
Report. The university is required to 
publish it by state and federal law be-
cause of the 1990 Jeanne Clery Act, 
which mandates that all institutions 
of higher education that take federal 
money disclose information about 
crime on and near campus.
In 2012, there were 17 cases of 
forcible sex offenses, including of-
fenses off campus property, on cam-
pus property, in campus residential 
buildings, and on public property. In 
2013, there were 16. This year, the 
Department of Education replaces 
the broadly de?ned “sex offenses, 
forcible,” with more granular cat-
egories, including rape, fondling, 
incest, and statutory rape. In 2014, 
there were six incidences of rape and 
three of fondling. There were also 27 
incidences of stalking — more than 
double the 13 that occurred in 2013 
— as well as two instances of domes-
tic violence and ?ve instances of dat-
ing violence.
The university has put measures 
into place to combat sexual assault, 
in response to an investigation by the 
Department of Education for mis-
conduct in handling cases of sexual 
assault and relationship violence. 
While Carnegie Mellon has taken sig-
ni?cant steps forward by establish-
ing the Of?ce of Title IX Initiatives 
and beginning to revamp its Sexual 
Assault Policy, it hasn’t been enough. 
Although there are fewer forcible 
sex offenses this year, the number of 
offenses related to stalking, dating 
violence, and domestic violence is 
shocking.
Carnegie Mellon is moving in the 
right direction, but it needs to con-
tinue putting new measures in place 
for preventing sexual assault and re-
lationship violence. The university 
must be transparent when it handles 
such cases; for many, this report is 
the only sign of a serious problem. 
Although Carnegie Mellon meets the 
minimum requirements of crime re-
porting as laid out by the Clery Act, 
they must go above and beyond and 
actively campaign to keep students 
informed.
Mayor Bill Peduto launched a 
new initiative this month to help 
Pittsburgh’s veterans rejoin the 
workforce and transition to civilian 
life. The initiative combines Home-
front Pittsburgh and the Veterans in 
Economic Communities Initiative 
(VECI). The VECI selected Pitts-
burgh, which has one of the highest 
veteran populations in the United 
States, as one of 50 cities involved in 
building economic bridges between 
veterans and the organizations eager 
to work with them.
“The greatest barriers returning 
veterans face are translating their 
skills, establishing their professional 
credentials, and ?nding quality work 
— jobs that honor their service and 
put their military experience to good 
use. By leveraging national resourc-
es to advance local goals, Pittsburgh 
can be a model city for transition-
ing veterans and military families,” 
Peduto stated in the of?cial press re-
lease announcing the program.
The Tartan is pleased to see May-
or Peduto and Pittsburgh taking a 
stand for veterans, one of the most 
important but also most neglected 
and mistreated factions of the popu-
lation. It’s absurd how dif?cult it can 
be for many veterans to get hired 
after ending their service. Military 
service provides people with unique 
skills and experiences that should 
translate to civilian jobs rather than 
keep veterans from them.
While Homefront Pittsburgh 
and VECI could have easily stuck to 
positive rhetoric and grown stag-
nant when it came to real action, the 
program seems extensive and well-
planned. It began encouragingly this 
week with a free monthlong profes-
sional writing course through the 
Bakery Square Google of?ces’ Learn-
ing Hub. 
Communicating effectively is a 
skill vital to the job search, espe-
cially in regard to writing resumes 
and cover letters. This professional 
writing course will likely greatly as-
sist veterans in ?nding good jobs and 
performing well in the workplace.
The Tartan hopes Homefront 
Pittsburgh will continue to take mea-
sures to improve the lives of this city’s 
veterans. They served our country, 
and now we should serve them.
Representatives from The Tar-
tan and The Thistle were taken on a 
tour of the Jared L. Cohon University 
Center expansion construction site 
last Thursday. 
The tour was led by Director of 
Student Activities Liz Vaughan, As-
sistant Director of Athletics and 
Recreational Programming Sara 
Gauntner, Director of Marketing for 
Student Affairs Operations Mandi 
Semple, and Campus Design & Fa-
cility Development Project Manager 
Adam Homer.
Lasting about an hour and cover-
ing all of the major selling points of 
the expansion, the tour took us from 
the new athletic facilities, to behind-
the-scenes of the performance the-
ater, to the once-controversial shell 
space turned student work center 
and ?nally, to the new, state-of-the-
art lobby that will be the new focal 
point for university visitors entering 
campus from Forbes Ave. 
The project is incredibly expan-
sive and the progress that has been 
made so far is exciting. Even our tour 
guides, who may not be on-site daily,  
were surprised by how fast the proj-
ect changes every time they travel 
behind the chain-link fence that has 
kept the project shrouded in mystery 
for so long.
The tour was the ?rst of many 
that will be offered to students 
across campus. These tours will be 
focused on the demographics that 
are most invested in the new facil-
ity: the dance performance groups, 
the members of student government 
who made the acquisition of the shell 
space possible, and the “Ambassa-
dors”: the Proud to Be Plaid Commit-
tee, the Highland Ambassadors, and 
the Andrew Ambassadors. Tours will 
also be offered to alumni and visitors 
during six already booked times over 
Cèilidh Weekend.
The Tartan is excited by the prog-
ress that has been made and by how 
much student input has gone into 
the massive project. The university 
has shown that the $26 million in-
vestment will go toward improving 
campus life with students in mind, 
which is a refreshing development 
in the midst of so many not-student-
focused donations. This upcoming 
week, the university will ask for stu-
dent input on the furniture that will 
occupy the new space.
The onus is now on the students 
to take advantage of the opportuni-
ties to express their desires and con-
cerns with campus projects. Taking 
an active role in helping to guide 
these projects shows that you care 
about the experience of the future 
student body. As the university sets 
their sights on tomorrow’s students, 
it is important that we do the same.
Boehner jumps sinking Republican ship, drags democracy down also
SINEAD FOLEY
Junior Staffwriter
Congress has reached mythic lev-
els of non-productivity in the past 
few years. The 112th Congress was 
the most unproductive in history, 
at least until the 113th showed up. 
Things were looking a bit brighter 
for this year, but with Speaker John 
Boehner (R-OH)’s announcement 
that he is resigning from the speak-
ership and his seat in the House of 
Representatives — effective Oct. 30, 
according to USA Today — the fu-
ture is looking stormy.
Boehner’s resignation is a victory 
for right-wing conservatives, signal-
ing the continued radicalization of 
the Republican Party. This radical-
ization is a threat to Congress’s abil-
ity to function, both in its practical 
role as the United States’ legislative 
branch of government and its ideo-
logical role as a representative body.
The straw that broke Boehner’s 
back on Friday was the imminent 
government shutdown. Yes, another 
shutdown. This time, extremist Re-
publicans wanted to use the spend-
ing bill that would keep the govern-
ment funded for the rest of the year 
to make a stand against abortion. 
This powerful minority would not 
vote for any bill that contained fund-
ing for Planned Parenthood, even if 
it meant shutting the government 
down. This is a classic example of 
the Tea Party’s “take no prisoners” 
strategy. They want to hold the gov-
ernment hostage until their political 
demands are met.
Boehner was a huge roadblock 
to this no-compromise strategy. He 
was well known as a dealmaker who 
searched for ways to reach across 
the aisle and keep things moving. 
While hardly a bipartisan force, he 
is an establishment Republican who 
knows how the political machine 
works. Tea Partiers, by contrast, are 
purists. They have been laying siege 
to Boehner for most of his ?ve-year 
run as Speaker because they wanted 
him to use the Republican majority 
to force their positions through the 
House. In the process, they com-
pletely ignored a ?libuster-bound 
Senate and a Democratic president 
with veto power looming like a ?nal 
boss over every law.
Any no-compromise strategy 
should worry everyone, even people 
who are politically aligned with con-
servatives. On the surface, a purist 
politician seems great. A politician 
who is straightforward about their 
beliefs, willing to ?ght hard, and 
unwilling to play political games 
sounds like breath of fresh air. In ac-
tuality, such an individual is dedicat-
ed to the destruction of democracy.
The House Freedom Caucus, 
the most recent embodiment of the 
“hell no” branch of the Republi-
can Party, has approximately thirty 
members, according to National Re-
view. A group of thirty people hold-
ing an economic and political gun 
to the government in the form of a 
shutdown is not democracy — it is 
political terrorism. No one, from the 
Freedom Caucus to the American 
Communist Party, should be able 
to force their minority views on an 
unwilling country. Boehner’s resig-
nation is a sign of how powerful this 
faction is becoming, and a warning 
to people who want a functioning 
democratic government.
Currently, it looks like the speak-
ership will stay in the hands of es-
tablishment Republicans. House 
Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy 
(R-CA) is the expected successor. 
He is de?nitely of the establishment, 
known for being friendly with both 
Tea Party conservatives and mod-
erates. However, many people are 
concerned that McCarthy is not a 
strong enough force, personally or 
politically, to bind the party togeth-
er. He is known for hosting movie 
nights and playing pranks on fellow 
Congressmen, not for making tough 
political decisions and inspiring loy-
alty, stated The Washington Post.
People vote based on a politi-
cian’s political platform. Does a 
candidate share your views on the 
economy, civil rights, privacy, abor-
tion, and a plethora of other issues? 
While ideological questions are im-
portant, it might be time for people 
to start looking a little more closely 
at how candidates work within the 
practical political machinery of 
Washington. 
With Boehner’s resignation, the 
no-compromise politicians we’ve 
been sending to Congress have man-
aged to tear apart a system of House 
leadership that has been in place 
since the Civil War. If we want to 
preserve America’s unique democra-
cy, it’s time we start taking care of it.

A PERSON’S OPINION
The Tartan broke out its cozy sweaters and cool leather jackets this week. So we asked,
What’s your favorite Autumn treat?

“Collaborative learning” fails to collaborate with introverts
SARAH BENDER
Junior Stafwriter
When you walk into a classroom 
today, you are just as likely to ?nd 
students engaged in a class discus-
sion or group project as listening to 
a lecture — if not more so. With in-
creased emphasis on “collaborative 
learning” and “?ipped classrooms,” 
many schools today are praised for 
being more dynamic, interesting, 
and educationally bene?cial than 
traditional schools. Even at colleges, 
seminars are rapidly becoming more 
popular than traditional lectures.
But some shyer, more introverted 
students suffer perpetually over par-
ticipation grades, and sometimes no 
amount of pleading and punishment 
can encourage them to speak up. Per-
haps educators need to step back and 
examine the reason behind these stu-
dents’ lack of contribution.
It is true that some 
students 
thrive in social situations, learning 
best when discussing their ideas out 
loud with others. However, there are 
some students who process informa-
tion most ef?ciently on their own, 
and even those whose fear of speak-
ing aloud can have a crippling effect 
on their education. The true danger 
of this “one size ?ts all” model for ed-
ucation is that some students’ needs 
will be continually overlooked in fa-
vor of the majority.
The primary argument for col-
laborative learning at the expense 
of introverts’ comfort is that all stu-
dents, even the quiet ones, need to 
be prepared for “real world” situa-
tions that will arise in their profes-
sional lives. This argument may well 
be grounded. Even   if     the  students 
manage  to ?nd a job where they                    
don’t have to interact with others, it 
is almost guaranteed that they will be 
forced to  speak up during the inter-
view process.
Rather than punishing students 
for their fears, there must be a gen-
tler way to ease them into feeling 
comfortable with sharing their opin-
ions out loud. Maybe instructors can 
start out by having students speak in 
small groups before they graduate to 
larger full class discussions. Maybe 
discussion questions can be given to 
the class in advance so that students 
will have time to plan their answers 
more thoroughly.
Also, teachers and schools should 
keep in mind that there are many 
other ways these students might par-
ticipate. Maybe a student takes care-
ful notes throughout a discussion so 
they can think about the ideas on 
their own. Maybe the student thrives 
during one-on-one discussions, or 
turns in well-written responses to 
prompts based on the material.
In other words, just because a stu-
dent is silent doesn’t mean they are 
not actively engaging in the learning 
process. Educators shouldn’t be so 
quick to write off quiet students as 
lazy or uninterested.
By de?nition, introverts need qui-
et time to process information and re-
charge — something being constant-
ly stimulated by group activity will 
not grant them. In the context of 
group discussions, some introverts 
may contribute as much as any extro-
verted student; the underlying differ-
ence is that this is not the best way for 
them to learn.
While American schools are in-
creasing emphasis on “collective” 
learning, other cultures continue to 
emphasize individual, instruction-
based learning. International stu-
dents at universities may therefore 
be at a disadvantage.
All students are different, and as 
such, they respond in different ways 
to various teaching methods. Some 
students are frightened by group dis-
cussions, some are drained by one-
on-one interaction in smaller groups, 
and others may be easily distracted 
or have dif?culty focusing during in-
dependent reading or studying time.
Formal education should 
meet in the middle of all these 
students’ needs. There is a ?ne line 
that educators must walk between 
genuinely preparing students for the 
future and making them afraid to 
come to class.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
In last week’s article, “CMU’s vis-
iting policymakers are all talk, not 
enough action,” Satvika Neti gets it 
right: we need to advocate for change 
and educate ourselves to create it. 
But there are smart ways to advocate 
for what you want.
The Graduate Student Assembly 
(GSA) regularly advocates on behalf 
of Carnegie Mellon’s graduate popu-
lation. Recently, we had students in 
Washington D.C. meet with Senator 
Bob Casey (D—PA)’s and Represen-
tative Michael F. Doyle (D—PA)’s 
of?ces to discuss graduate student 
issues. Our agenda included student 
visa reform, graduate education, 
open access, educational resources, 
and graduate student debt.
These meetings went well, and 
they were interested in our causes. 
The GSA has found that giving the 
right kind of information is how 
you get policymakers to care. We’re 
working to become a go-to source of 
information for these Pennsylvania 
political of?ces by sharing graduate 
student stories, backing our propos-
als with facts, and generally building 
working relationships with them.
We were there to make graduate 
students’ experiences vivid for the 
policy makers. We shared stories of 
students stuck out of the country 
because of single-entry visa issues 
and students who almost had to put 
the start of their American dream 
on hold because of graduate student 
loans. By sharing these experiences, 
we got them interested in what we 
had to say. With their interest piqued, 
we moved on to providing evidence 
to support our claims and propos-
als. As the ?rst people in Casey’s of-
?ce to support open access, or un-
restricted online access to research, 
we were able to counter publishing 
industry myths and share how open 
access policies actually work. Due to 
that evidence, the staff seemed more 
receptive in supporting our goals.
The GSA went to D.C. to build re-
lationships with politicians so that 
we can serve as representatives for 
graduate student issues. Part of this 
means that we thanked politicians for 
supporting our causes, like Casey did 
when he extended the Perkins Loan 
program or Doyle does by supporting 
open access. It also means that we 
return biannually and maintain com-
munication in the time between our 
visits. To make a difference with poli-
ticians, you must build relationships 
based on information exchange. 
That’s what policymakers want, and 
that’s what you need to do to create 
change.

Water on Mars shows astronomy deserves more federal funding
HANNAH JANG
Junior Staffwriter
A general rule of thumb is that 
if Google cares enough to feature a 
special doodle for a speci?c event, 
something big is happening. On 
Sept. 29, users around the globe 
were pleasantly surprised with a 
new Google doodle celebrating the 
of?cial discovery of water on Mars.
NASA’s analyses of the planet 
have proven that enigmatic streaks 
on Mars’ slopes are made from salty, 
liquid water. This water may have 
the capacity to support the chemi-
cal reactions necessary for life. 
While we could now hope to ful?ll 
our childhood ET dreams, this could 
more realistically signal the pos-
sibility of sending the ?rst manned 
spacecraft to Mars. Since scientists 
now know more about the planet, 
they will be better equipped to engi-
neer a spacecraft suitable for such a 
trip.
With greater knowledge of 
the mysterious planet has come 
an emergence of related projects. 
These include Mars One, a non-prof-
it organization with the objective 
of establishing a permanent human 
colony on Mars. One-way journeys 
are scheduled to depart starting in 
2026, and from a pool of 200,000 
applicants from 35 countries, 100 
crew members have been selected. 
After the discovery of water on 
Mars, the possibilities are endless.
Certainly, this recent discovery 
has successfully reached main-
stream media. It has been covered 
by many major news sources along-
side Google. However, interest in 
astronomy is rare in this modern 
technological age. Many continue to 
question the importance of astrono-
my in a world apparently operated 
and dominated by technology. 
Congress continues to cut NASA’s 
federal funding. This year, NASA’s 
budget totaled 0.50 percent of the 
federal budget ($17 M), in stark 
contrast to the height of the space 
race in the 1960s, when NASA was 
allotted 4.41 percent of the federal 
budget ($43 M).
Although the discovery of water 
in Mars is exciting in itself, the un-
common feat of space-related news 
making national headlines is also an 
exciting prospect for many citizens 
who believe more attention should 
be given to astronomy.

After a week with the iPhone 6s, I’m con-
vinced that Apple has once again managed 
to create a great mobile experience. The 
“S” series of iPhones has long been known 
to feature more incremental updates than 
revolutionary ones, but despite the fact that 
the iPhone 6s is not a base model, it stands 
to impress with many of its new features. It 
is not a completely new experience, but one 
that takes an already good experience and 
makes it even better.
The largest noticeable difference be-
tween the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s is speed. 
The newly improved TouchID is so fast that 
unlocking your phone feels nearly instanta-
neous. In addition, waiting for apps to load 
is a thing of the past. This is a result of the 
new A9 processor which Apple touts as of-
fering 70 percent faster CPU performance 
and 90 percent faster GPU performance 
than its predecessor.
To make the experience even better, Ap-
ple has added 3D touch feature of its Apple 
watch to its lineup of phones. 3D Touch 
adds depth to multi-touch and allows the 
user to select additional options by apply-
ing force to the screen. It makes many ev-
ery day tasks easy, such as creating a new 
reminder, by simply allowing the user to 
select additional options. “Peek and Pop” 
gives the user the ability to see a quick pre-
view of webpages, emails, and other items, 
with the ability to “pop” these items by ap-
plying a bit more pressure. 3D touch now 
transforms the keyboard into a trackpad.
Through features like these, 3D Touch 
offers many useful tweaks that offer great 
improvements to iOS overall. 3D Touch is 
combined with Apple’s Taptic Engine to 
provide instant feedback to the user when 
force is applied to the screen. When one 
applies pressure to the screen, a response 
is given back to the user in the form of a 
tap. This is the same technology that pow-
ers the feedback of Force Touch on the 
Apple Watch and the new trackpads on this 
year’s lineup of MacBooks. It is extremely 
precise and gives the user the feeling that 
the phone has directly responded to the 
amount of pressure applied.
In addition to the speed bumps and new 
interaction methods provided by 3D Touch, 
the entire iPhone is tougher than ever. The 
enclosure is made up of the same durable 
7000-series aluminum, used in the Watch 
Sport as well as by the aerospace industry. 
Apple has also added stronger ion glass that 
it claims is the strongest in the industry.
Even more amazing is the fact that Ap-
ple has nearly waterproofed the iPhone 6s, 
a feature that they did not advertise at all. 
According to Engadget, “Apple packed in a 
new gasket around the sides of the phone, 
and it encased every cable connector on the 
phone’s logic board with a waterproo?ng 
material.” This contrasts with the method 
of protecting external ports used by most 
companies, resulting in more effective wa-
ter resistance. It is highly effective and will 
likely result in fewer customers at the Ge-
nius Bar after dropping their phones in the 
toilet.
In addition to adding more functionality 
and durability, the iPhone 6s has received 
a major boost in camera specs. The new 
camera now shoots at 12 MP and is capable 
of recording 4K video. A new image signal 
processor, along with other hardware and 
software enhancements, have also been 
added to make images even better. After

Dark energy instrument receives funding from Department of Energy
RYAN BRIGDEN
Junior Staffwriter
In the ongoing effort to 
understand the structure of 
the universe, the recent fed-
eral approval of the Dark En-
ergy Spectroscopic Instrument 
(DESI) has ensured a promis-
ing next step. According to 
DESI’s website, DESI “will 
measure the effect of dark 
energy on the expansion of 
the universe and obtain opti-
cal spectra for tens of millions 
of galaxies and quasars, con-
structing a 3-dimensional map 
spanning the nearby universe 
to 10 billion light years.” The 
receipt of Critical Decision-2 
funding from the Department 
of Energy has secured funding 
of the project for the next ten 
years, allowing scientists to 
gather information about the 
nature of dark matter, dark en-
ergy, and the expansion of the 
universe.
Shirley Ho, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Physics and a member 
of Carnegie Mellon’s McWil-
liams Center for Cosmology, 
is the co-chair of the project’s 
Galaxy and Quasar Clustering 
Working Group. In this capac-
ity, Ho leads the preparation 
and analysis of data received 
from the telescope. Over two 
hundred researchers from 
around the world will work 
alongside Ho.
“DESI will push science fur-
ther than we have ever gone 
before,” Ho said. “We will get a 
map of the universe from when 
the universe was very young, 
about one-seventh of its cur-
rent age. This will help us to 
better understand dark matter, 
dark energy and other myste-
rious things in our universe.” 
Among other questions, Ho 
and her colleagues hope to 
gain a better understanding 
of the accelerating expansion 
of the universe, an observa-
tion not in line with Einstein’s 
theory of gravity. Beyond map-
ping the universe, DESI will 
provide valuable information 
that will allow researchers to 
envision baryon acoustic oscil-
lations, which are density ?uc-
tuations in the early universe. 
DESI will also provide insight 
into the standard model of 
particle physics by focusing on 
the total mass of neutrinos in 
the universe.
DESI is set to be mounted 
on the Mayall Telescope, which 
is operated by the National 
Optical Astronomy Observa-
tory and is located in Tucson, 
Arizona. In order to meet 
DESI’s operational require-
ments, the Mayall telescope 
will be augmented with new, 
intricate glass lenses that will 
help focus light onto DESI’s fo-
cal plane. 5,000 robotic arms 
will position optical ?bres so 
that they capture light from a 
speci?c point of interest, such 
as a galaxy or quasar. With this 
sophisticated tool, researchers 
aim to measure spectra of over 
30 million galaxies and qua-
sars. The Baryon Oscillation 
Spectroscopic Survey of the 
Sloan Digital Sky Survey, DE-
SI’s predecessor, was only able 
to measure approximately one 
tenth as many objects.
With funding in place, the 
?rst measurements from the 
Mayall 4-meter telescope in 
Tucson, Arizona are expected 
to begin in 2018. Dark mat-
ter and energy are enigmatic 
quantities that continue to 
evade the understanding of 
modern science, but DESI is 
set to begin a decade of un-
precedented exploration, 
which could hopefully lead 
to answers to some of our 
questions.
CMU professor on Popular Science’s Brilliant Top 10 list

Medicine is going through 
an incredible transformation 
and evolution as scientists 
uncover new and advanced 
ways to manipulate biology in 
the hope of improving human 
lives. Kathryn Whitehead, an 
assistant professor of chemi-
cal engineering at Carnegie 
Mellon, has made incredible 
contributions to this advance-
ment through her extensive 
research on nanoparticles 
that target speci?c areas of 
the body in order to curb 
the threat of disease. Her re-
search and accomplishments 
have recently earned her the 
honor of being featured on 
Popular Science’s Brilliant Top 
10 List in 2015.
Whitehead completed 
her undergraduate degree 
in chemical engineering, but 
wasn’t particularly interested 
in applying her knowledge to 
oil re?neries. As she began 
her graduate studies, chemi-
cal engineers were just be-
ginning to extend their ?eld 
into the scope of biomedical 
applications. Whitehead felt 
that using techniques “to help 
people and their problems” 
was a particularly rewarding 
use of her education.
Whitehead explained that 
chemical engineers develop-
ing techniques to modernize 
medicine generally have two 
goals. The ?rst goal is to take 
drugs that are currently avail-
able in a non-friendly format, 
such as injections, and de-
velop a friendlier system of 
delivery. For example, diabet-
ics normally take insulin in-
jections to control their blood 
sugar level, but researchers 
hope to bypass the injections 
by using a pill or a patch sys-
tem to introduce a protein 
therapeutic into the body. The 
second goal is to take drugs 
that currently don’t have FDA 
approved methods of delivery 
and develop mechanisms for 
an ef?cient delivery system. 
These drugs, for example, can 
include modern genetic based 
mechanisms that manipulate 
the underlying biochemistry 
inside cells by altering DNA 
and protein expression.
Whitehead and her team 
of researchers have been 
working in the lab over the 
past ?ve years on identify-
ing useful chemical make-
ups for nanoparticles using 
high throughput screening, 
a scienti?c method that uses 
robotics, data processing 
software, and various detec-
tors to quickly run millions 
of chemical, genetic, or phar-
maceutical tests. Throughout 
this process, Whitehead’s 
team has identi?ed a subset 
of chemical compositions that 
are bene?cial for turning the 
nanoparticles into useful tools 
for drug delivery. “We now 
have the technology, and our 
goal is to apply it to a variety 
of diseases,” Whitehead said.
The nanoparticles are 
carefully designed to distin-
guish between healthy and 
non-healthy cells using both 
active targeting and more 
subtle approaches. These 
methods can be extremely 
useful in cancer treatment. 
Current cancer treatment 
methods involve exposing the 
body to toxins in hope that the

Large polymer additive makes fuel less explosive
Researchers at the Califor-
nia Institute of Technology 
have engineered a “mega-su-
pramolecule” that can be add-
ed to ?ammable fuels such as 
gasoline or kerosene to ward 
off explosions in the event of 
an impact. 
During a vehicular ac-
cident, fuel droplets tend to 
form clouds, which linger in 
the air and create violent ex-
plosions when ignited. The 
new additive consists of a 
large polymer that interacts 
with fuel molecules. This 
interaction produces much 
larger droplets which do not 
linger, effectively negating 
the extremely dangerous fuel 
clouds made by smaller mol-
ecules. The new additve also 
breaks apart under pressure, 
which ensures that the addi-
tive will not clog fuel pumps.

Porous portabella mushrooms preserve cellphone batteries
It’s the marriage of the 
century: fungi and electron-
ics. Researchers at the Univer-
sity of California, Riverside 
Bourns College of Engineer-
ing have turned to porta-
bella mushrooms to present 
a low-cost and environmen-
tally friendly alternative for 
graphite anodes in recharge-
able lithium-ion batteries. 
The mushrooms are porous, 
meaning they feature a lot of 
small spaces through which 
liquid and air can pass. When 
applied to batteries, this 
structure creates more space 
for energy to be transferred 
and stored. In addition, using 
the mushrooms in anode fab-
rication could allow batteries 
to increase in capacity with 
use, rather than decrease, 
due to their high potassium 
content, which allows activa-
tion of certain dead-end pores 
during the battery’s use.

Baby booty bacteria found to predict asthma
Researchers working on 
the C.H.I.L.D. study exam-
ined stool and urine samples 
from over 300 babies at three 
months old and then again at 
one year. They also acquired 
their health information at 
one, three, and ?ve years old. 
Upon inspection, they discov-
ered a correlation between 
low or undetectable levels of 
four certain bacteria at three 
months and the development 
of asthma at one year old. This 
discovery could help speed up 
asthma diagnosis, but could 
also help identify the cause 
of and prevent asthma all to-
gether. This research created 
statistically signi?cant results 
that provide clout to the hy-
pothesis that the microbiome 
— the ecosystem of bacteria 
within our bodies — has sig-
ni?cant effects on our health.

Placebo predicts effectiveness of real drug
Researchers at the Uni-
versity of Michigan’s Medi-
cal School have long been 
pioneers in studying the 
brain’s “painkilling” mu-opi-
oid system and its response 
to placebo drugs. In a recent 
study, they showed that par-
ticipants with depression 
who reported symptom im-
provement after taking a pla-
cebo showed the strongest 
mu-opioid response in brain 
regions involved in emotion 
and depression. These indi-
viduals were also more likely 
to show signs of improvement 
when taking the real drug 
than those whom the placebo 
did not affect. These ?ndings 
are the ?rst to show that the 
brain’s opiod system is in-
volved in the body’s response 
to antidepressants and pla-
cebos, and could be used to 
develop better, faster-acting 
antidepressants.

Researchers search for the formula for happiness 
Christian Bayer, from the 
Hausdorff Center for Math-
ematics at the University of 
Bonn, has established a con-
nection between long-term 
increases in income and per-
sonal happiness and satisfac-
tion. This research has shown 
that just having more money 
does not make one more con-
tent; only long-term income 
increases affect happiness. 
The ?ndings also identi?ed 
that individuals who consis-
tently have more work are 
less happy. This contradicts 
the idea that people are more 
happy with any job than none 
at all, suggesting that it is not 
the lack of work, but the lack 
of income from which people 
suffer. Bayer says that “the 
formula for greater satisfac-
tion in life seems to be: per-
sistently more money while 
working the same number of 
hours.”

Researchers map reactions in muscle during exercise
Research completed at the 
University of Sydney’s Charles 
Perkins Centre provides a 
comprehensive blueprint of 
the 1,000 molecular reac-
tions that occur in skeletal 
muscles during exercise. This 
was done by analyzing skel-
etal muscle from untrained, 
healthy males ten minutes af-
ter intense exercise.
This breakthrough will al-
low researchers to focus their 
efforts and develop drugs 
which target not a single 
chemical, but multiple mole-
cules and perhaps even entire 
pathways. 
This discovery establishes 
a basis for the development 
of drugs which can mimic the 
bene?cial effects of exercise 
for patients who need the ef-
fects of exercise, but cannot 
exercise themselves.

HOW THINGS WORK
Development of television includes complex electronics
JONATHAN CALVELLO
Junior Staffwriter
My personal favorite was 
Breaking Bad. The storyline 
was great, the acting was phe-
nomenal, and did you see that 
ending? Fantastic.
I’m talking about my favor-
ite television show, and, for 
those of you who aren’t laptop 
Net?ix junkies, the television 
provides the outlet through 
which we watch these shows. 
Beginning in 1897, when J.J. 
Thompson was able to experi-
mentally de?ect cathode rays, 
the television has had a long 
and storied history. All-color 
electronic televisions were 
?rst standardized in 1953, 
but it wasn’t until 1990 that 
the modern version of digital 
television became possible.
The ?rst type of television 
to become industrially popu-
lar was the analog televi-
sion. The analog television 
contains a cathode ray tube 
(CRT), which is a vacuum 
containing an electron gun, a 
positively charged anode, and 
a negatively charged cathode. 
The electrons emitted from 
the electron gun are negative, 
so they ?ow from the cathode 
to the anode. The electron 
beam is then concentrated 
through a device called a fo-
cusing anode, after which it 
hits a phosphor screen on the 
opposite end of the CRT that 
glows when struck by high-
energy electrons. In order to 
scatter the electrons across 
the screen and produce a full 
image, a copper wire coil is 
placed in the CRT. This coil 
creates a magnetic ?eld when 
an electron beam is passed 
through it, and this magnetic 
?eld pushes the electrons in 
varying directions, causing

Krzysztof Matyjaszewski wins Dreyfus Prize for polymer research
YUE YIN
Junior Staffwriter
The Camille and Henry 
Dreyfus Foundation has an-
nounced that Krzysztof Ma-
tyjaszewski, J. C. Warner Uni-
versity Professor of Natural 
Sciences at Carnegie Mellon 
University, has won the 2015 
Dreyfus Prize in the Chemi-
cal Sciences. According to  
www.dreyfus.org, the Dreyfus 
Prize is awarded biennially 
and “recognizes an individual 
for exceptional and original 
research in a selected area of 
chemistry that has advanced 
the ?eld in a major way.” 
This year’s topic was Mak-
ing Molecules and Materials. 
While presenting the award, 
Henry C. Walter, President of 
the Dreyfus Foundation, said, 
“Krzysztof Matyjaszewski’s 
work in polymer chemistry 
follows in the tradition of Ca-
mille and Henry Dreyfus, who 
were major innovators in the 
?eld of material engineering 
in their day. We are proud to 
recognize his immense ac-
complishments with the Drey-
fus Prize.” Since the award 
is presented at the winner’s 
institution, Matyjaszewski 
gave an enlightening lecture 
about his research during the 
award ceremony last Wednes-
day in the Mellon Institute 
Auditorium.
Matyjaszewski’s great-
est achievements lie in the 
development of the Atom 
Transfer Radical Polymeriza-
tion (ATRP) process, de?ned 
by the International Union of 
Pure and Applied Chemistry 
(IUPAC) as “controlled revers-
ible-deactivation radical po-
lymerization.” In this process, 
the deactivation of radicals, or 
highly reactive molecules, in-
volves reversible atom trans-
fer or reversible group trans-
fer catalyzed usually, though 
not exclusively, by transition-
metal complexes. Matyjasze-
wski explained ATRP to the 
public as a method that uses 
macromolecular engineer-
ing to tame free, monomer 
radicals. Monomers are mol-
ecules that can bind together 
to form a polymer. Though 
radicals are useful in forming 
polymers, they are generally 
too reactive and short-lived 
to form the correct shape of 
polymer that researchers and 
industries want. The ATRP 
process uses speci?c catalysts 
to set active monomers into 
dormant states and uses a 
reducing agent to let the dor-
mant radical go back to the ac-
tive stage. In this way, mono-
mers can switch between their 
active and dormant states 
and, therefore, have an ex-
tended life span.
When they were invented 
in 1995, ATRP methods were 
expensive and not nearly as 
ef?cient as they are now. Sev-
eral activator regeneration 
ATRP methods involving dif-
ferent reducing agents were 
developed afterwards, in-
cluding photoinduced ATRP. 
Matyjaszewski and his team 
contributed the most towards 
extending metal-free ATRP 
into the polymerization of ac-
rylonitrile, which successfully 
advanced polymer synthesis 
and macromolecular engi-
neering.
According to www.dreyfus.
org, in addition to the devel-
opment of ATRP, Matyjasze-
wski also helped transfer the 
ATRP process to industry, 
where it has “applications that 
include automotive coatings, 
adhesives, cosmetics, inkjet 
printing, smart and electronic 
materials, and many others, 
with an estimated commercial 
value exceeding $20 billion.”
In his lecture, Matyjasze-
wski mentioned several of his 
research projects, including 
those involving bottlebrush-
structured polymers that have 
exactly the same topology, 
or geometric structure, as a 
regular bottlebrush, a type of 
shrub with cylindrical ?owers. 
The polymers, which assist in 
lubricating joints, are made by 
creating a backbone and then 
attaching side chains to it.
Matyjaszewski also dis-
cussed super-soft elastomers 
that were made from these 
bottlebrushes. In order to 
make the material super-soft, 
it must be gel-like, but ap-
proximately 99 percent of 
water molecules that are usu-
ally contained in the gels don’t 
hold on to each other tightly 
enough. To combat this issue, 
the research group replaced 
the water molecules with 
polymers. They found that 
when they dropped an egg 
from a three story building 
onto a piece of elastomer ma-
terial, the egg did not break. 
Matyjaszewski also men-
tioned one of his student’s 
ideas about using polymer 
escorted passenger-SiRNA to 
treat heterotopic ossi?cation 
through preventative clinical 
therapy.
Matyjaszewski described 
his experience as a researcher 
in polymers by explaining that 
his research bene?tted from 
the incorporation of his work 
with his imagination.
 “I feel very honored and 
?attered to receive the Drey-
fus Prize for making mol-
ecules and materials,” Maty-
jaszewski said in a university 
press release. “This recogni-
tion addresses not only con-
tributions of my students and 
collaborators, but also all 
polymer chemists working in 
the area of macromolecular 
materials with controlled ar-
chitecture and functionality 
for targeted applications.”
toxins kill the cancerous cells, 
but have a lower impact on the 
rest of the body. Unfortunate-
ly, many patients suffer from 
the toxins and experience 
grief and pain from their treat-
ment. Nanoparticle drug de-
livery methods could improve 
cancer treatments by making 
the treatment more targeted. 
Cancerous cells have a unique 
biological make-up, which in-
cludes a different expression 
of protein ligands on the out-
side of their cells. Nanopar-
ticles are able to target this 
unique external structure by 
using a lock and key mecha-
nism. In this mechanism, 
when the nanoparticles travel 
through the bloodstream, 
they lock on to the proteins of 
interest on cancerous cells due 
to structural similarities be-
tween the two. Alternatively, 
a non-direct, but more com-
plicated, approach involves 
detecting cells that over or 
under express certain proteins 
that cause the cell to develop 
a disease phenotype. In this 
method, once locked on the 
cell, the nanoparticle can de-
liver a toxin directly to the cell.
“Cancer therapy is so dif-
?cult for patients, in large 
part, because of the toxic side 
effects of chemotherapy,” 
Whitehead said in a university 
press release. “In contrast, our 
targeted nanoparticles deliver 
drugs only to cancerous tissue, 
sparing healthy cells. We ex-
pect these targeted treatments 
to extend the lives of cancer 
patients while increasing their 
quality of life through a reduc-
tion in side effects.” In a clini-
cal setting, “these methods 
will not replace current treat-
ments, but could be used in co-
ordination to have a stronger, 
more targeted impact,” White-
head said in an interview with 
The Tartan. Patients can be 
exposed to the nanoparticles 
during chemotherapy treat-
ment to have a dual-faced at-
tack and, hopefully, reduce 
the number of times a patient 
has to endure the chemo-
therapy toxins. Currently the 
research team is applying the 
nanoparticles to a variety of 
diseases ranging from cancer 
to chronic illnesses.
While Whitehead has 
worked very hard, she gives 
a lot of credit to her collabo-
rators and research teams. A 
major aspect of her research 
involves working with clini-
cians at various hospitals, 
whose input is valuable as it 
reveals the practical impact 
these new techniques can 
have on patients. Whitehead 
also notes the importance of 
the students working in her 
labs. While she is proud of 
her ability to develop tangible 
products that could improve 
people’s lives, she sees the 
students she trains as another 
valuable product of her hard 
work. She wants them to de-
velop the same intuition and 
passion she carries herself so 
that they will continue to de-
velop great things in their own 
careers.
Whitehead has been able 
to ?nd success early in her 
scienti?c career and make sig-
ni?cant contributions to the 
scienti?c community. She be-
lieves the key to her success is 
that “she just keeps going, per-
severing towards a goal.”
“Science is very hard,” 
Whitehead said, “and being 
smart only gets you so far. Al-
most nothing works the ?rst 
time you try it, but if you keep 
your eyes on the prize ... you 
could change the world.”

At Pugwash, our discus-
sions regarding ethics in sci-
ence and technology can cover 
a lot of ground. Some of the 
topics are removed from our 
day-to-day lives, such as dis-
cussions of cryonics or space 
junk. Other topics have a little 
more personal involvement, 
like last week’s regarding tech-
nology in the classroom.
We began talking about the 
practical problems that come 
from using technology. Does 
it work? Does it help learning?
A recent report from the 
Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development 
(OECD) showed that, on ag-
gregate, there was no correla-
tion between increased use of 
technology and improved test 
results. This overall data was 
supported by many personal 
experiences.
One Pugwash member talk-
ed about how their school had 
received funding for smart-
boards, which are like a cross 
between whiteboards, projec-
tor screens, and tablets. In their 
experience, the smartboards 
offered no better functionality 
than a regular whiteboard.
Another anecdote was a 
native Floridian’s experience 
with a state requirement for 
an online class. They were dis-
appointed with the class, and 
said most people saw it as just 
an excuse to not physically stay 
in school the entire day. In-
stead of using the extra time to 
work on the online class, they 
went to Chipotle or hung out 
with friends.
Doing schoolwork online 
also leads to many other dis-
tractions. It can be harder, in 
some classes, to browse Red-
dit or Facebook while the 
teacher is in the room with the 
students. When students are 
on their own, however, distrac-
tions are hard to avoid.
One member, an interna-
tional student from Germany, 
explained how they had all 
their lectures recorded online. 
The idea was for students to 
be able to go back through the 
material at their own pace, 
watching the hard parts re-
peatedly or the easier parts at 
twice the normal speed. Be-
cause of this, most students 
end up not going to lecture, be-
cause the video was available. 
However, they also don’t watch 
the video, because it’s easier 
to skip it when it’s an “on your 
own time” activity. The inclu-
sion of technology only makes 
it easier for students to be lazy.
Many of the American 
members agreed that if they 
had the choice to avoid lec-
tures, they probably would. 
Another German student, 
however, countered that we 
shouldn’t blame the technol-
ogy for the attitude of the stu-
dents. This member suggested 
that some might prefer the vid-
eotaped lectures to be available 
for early classes, because they 
would rather watch the record-
ing sometime when they’re 
more awake.
Another point was that the 
existing technology probably 
isn’t being used as effectively as 
it could be, to put it generously. 
More bluntly, it could be hor-
ribly misused. Teachers, text-
book producers, and the entire 
education industry are often 
being pushed to include more 
technology “because it’s the fu-
ture.” Without proper training 
on how to use the technology, 
and without research on its 
effectiveness, including tech-
nology for the sake of follow-
ing a fad can’t be expected to 
produce any results. One mem-
ber’s father works in textbook 
publishing, and the member 
said he often recommended 
not using the software that he 
was being pushed to include.
However, just because tech-
nology is currently being mis-
used doesn’t mean we should 
give up on it. It can still allow 
classes to do things in new and 
different ways, some of which 
might be effective. 
The OECD study looked 
at the correlation between 
technology and test scores 
in aggregate, which means 
it could be missing both re-
ally poor performers and also 
some really stellar uses of 
tech. An example was given of 
how physics classes can now 
simulate extremely complex 
processes that would have 
been hard to represent before 
computer modeling, or hard 
to conceptually grasp without 
computer visualization.
Approaching the topic from 
a different angle, one Pugwash 
member brought up the effect 
of technology on students from 
different socioeconomic back-
grounds. 
This member had worked 
with low-income students 
who didn’t have a computer 
at home, and they had a lot 
of trouble learning to work 
with the school computers. 
Wouldn’t including technology 
as part of the curriculum tilt 
the playing ?eld even further 
against poor students?
That very reason is why 
technology needs to be in-
cluded, another member said. 
If the exposure to comput-
ers is started early enough, 
then the students could learn 
how to use it at the same rate 
through the school system. The 
Pugwash member continued to 
say that in addition to regular 
reading literacy, web or com-
puter literacy should also be 
a required skill for graduation 
from the school system. Other 
participants thought that was 
a good idea, but maybe a little 
idealistic, because devoting 
more time to another standard 
would have to cut into already 
small resources.
The last major issue Pug-
wash addressed was the idea 
of a classroom where human 
pupils were instructed solely 
by robots or smart software. Is 
the presence of human teach-
ers somehow intrinsically ben-
e?cial to learning?
The general consensus 
was that a human touch was 
important. More than just in-
formation providers, teachers 
serve as mentors, caregivers, 
and friends. There’s also some-
thing about seeing another 
human get excited about a sub-
ject that a robot just wouldn’t 
match. One member thought 
that even though they could be 
programmed to show excite-
ment, students would still roll 
their eyes because they knew it 
would be just a program meant 
to show that “learning is fun!”
Another point that was 
brought up was that a person 
would still be at the other end 
of the program. Maybe the in-
dividual classrooms wouldn’t 
have a person in them, but a 
person would have to design 
the curriculum or set the pro-
gram in motion. To have a 
cohesive educational system, 
some person would have to be 
in charge.
But what if, as the last com-
mentator of the night suggest-
ed, machine learning could do 
that better than any human?
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational organiza-
tion that discusses the implica-
tions of science, technology, and 
medicine on society. This article 
is a summary of last week’s dis-
cussion on the use of technology 
in education.
PUGWASH
Technology has positive and negative effects in education
them to scatter across the 
screen. It is this interaction 
of electrons and phosphor on 
the screen that produces a 
glowing image.
So the CRT creates the im-
age on the screen, but how 
does a television know what 
image to produce? An ana-
log television receives two 
kinds of signals, sounds and 
pictures, which are typically 
received either through an 
antenna, a cable set, or a sat-
ellite dish. The picture signal 
is transmitted over AM sig-
nals, and the sound over FM 
signals, much like AM and 
FM radio signals. Inside the 
television, a demodulator 
receives the FM signal and 
converts it into a sound sig-
nal, which is then converted 
to sound through the televi-
sion’s speakers. As for the 
video signal, a receiver in 
the CRT takes the AM signal 
and transmits it as an ampli-
?cation signal in the electron 
gun. This signal then modi?es 
the intensity of the electron 
beam, producing the contrast 
of images that appear on the 
screen.
Although this type of tele-
vision was popular for the 
majority of the twentieth cen-
tury, and explains why the 
television is sometimes called 
“the tube,” CRT televisions 
are considered outdated by 
today’s technological stan-
dards. Today’s televisions run 
on a variety of different tech-
nologies, such as the popular 
liquid-crystal display (LCD). 
LCD televisions operate in a 
similar fashion to analog tele-
visions, only instead of using 
a CRT to beam electrons at a 
screen it uses cold cathode 
?orescent lamps to beam 
white light. In order to mod-
ify the light’s brightness, LCD 
shutters are placed in the tele-
vision. These shutters open 
and close to transmit a certain 
intensity of light over an area 
of the screen. In order to dis-
till out the desired color of the 
light, each shutter is paired 
with a color ?lter to pull out 
all but the desired color of the 
light beam.
Television is a relatively 
modern invention that has 
advanced from low-resolu-
tion, black-and white images 
to high-resolution, richly 
colored displays. Televisions 
rely on a signal input as well 
as some sort of conversion 
process to translate the signal 
into the images that we see 
on our screens. Even newer 
forms of technology are de-
veloping to create a 3-D televi-
sion, which takes into account 
depth perception to simulate 
a three-dimensional feel on a 
two-dimensional screen. Now 
that’s televisionary.

SARAH GUTEKUNST
Operations Manager
This past week was my 
strongest win to date.
My team put up 84 points 
for the week, while Team Le-
andro, who probably auto-
drafted and then never edited 
his lineup, mustered a whop-
ping 28 points.
I ?nally had a strong set 
of running backs to start — 
Le’Veon Bell came back from 
suspension, and LeGarrette 
Blount actually scored points. 
He really broke my heart 
in week two when he only 
rushed for four yards in his 
?rst appearance of the sea-
son, putting up a goose egg 
on the fantasy scoreboards. 
Unfortunately, my other run-
ning back, dead-to-me Jerick 
McKinnon, also rushed fewer 
than 10 yards.
But week three was a com-
pletely different story. Even 
though the Steelers struggled 
to score against the Ravens, 
Bell still showed why he was 
ranked the best overall draft 
pick of this season, rushing 
for 62 yards and scoring Pitts-
burgh’s only touchdown of 
the night. In the end, he still 
put 19 points on my board. I 
expect him to be my saving 
grace this season.
Blount’s week three fan-
tasy success can be attributed 
mostly to the absolute failure 
of the Jaguars. He scored 
three touchdowns and rushed 
for 78 yards, coming to a 
grand total of 26 points for 
the week. The Patriots have 
their bye this week, so I’ll have 
to wait a little while to judge 
whether or not this was an ab-
solute ?uke, but my instincts 
say yes.
Because I can’t play Blount 
for week four, I’ll have to bring 
McKinnon back as a starter, as 
much as it pains me. Since I’m 
in a 20-player league, there 
are simply no quality running 
backs to be found on waivers. 
And since my team is basically 
a combination of stars and 
losers, I’m not comfortable 
letting anyone go in a trade.
Despite my perpetual run-
ning back woes, I’m still pro-
jected to come out on top this 
week against the St. Pete Sem-
inoles. Although it’s possible 
that he has yet to even think 
about week four because he’s 
still starting two players with 
bye weeks. If that’s the case, 
I’m praying he sleeps past 1 
p.m. on Sunday.
I de?nitely have him beat 
in terms of quarterbacking. 
Russell Wilson has been my 
most consistent player so far 
this season, and I’m con?-
dent that he’ll come through. 
St. Pete, however, is starting 
Andrew Luck, who will warm 
the bench this week because 
of a shoulder injury. Too bad 
he didn’t check, because 
Luck’s backup on the bench 
is Jameis Winston, who will 
face off against the Panthers 
this weekend. The Panthers 
are proving to be a force to 
be reckoned with this season, 
and I’m not sure the Bucca-
neers will stand a chance. 
That could have meant big 
points for St. Pete, but I’m not 
complaining.
At running back, I expect 
absolutely nothing from McK-
innon, but I’m okay with that 
for now. Le’Veon Bell had a 
great performance Thursday 
night against Baltimore, even 
though the Steelers eventual-
ly suffered that painful defeat 
in overtime (looking at you 
Josh Scobee). Bell scored 20 
points, which is realistically 
enough to make up for McK-
innon and beat out both of 
St. Pete’s consistently single-
digit-scoring running backs.
I’m starting Pierre Garcon 
and Nate Washington at wide 
receiver this week, who have 
both been consistently put-
ting up between ?ve and 10 
points each week. St. Pete has 
Julio Jones, and, assuming he 
plays, I don’t expect either of 
my WRs to outscore him. I just 
need them to keep the gap as 
tight as possible. I also have 
wide receiver Eric Decker as 
my ?ex. He started the sea-
son strong but then suffered 
a knee injury in week two and 
sat on the bench week three. 
I’m cautious about his return, 
but hopeful that he’ll get back 
to where he was.
After week two I ?nally 
dropped wide receiver Nick 
Toon. As hilarious as his name 
is, he hasn’t scored a single 
point all season. In his place, 
I picked up Ladarius Green, 
who then got a pretty bad 
concussion. And now I’m back 
to where I started, with Jared 
Cook. He’s really just okay. 
But for this week I’ll survive 
because St. Pete is starting 
Eric Ebron, who is alright but 
no Gronk.
The Jets D/ST has had a 
pretty good season so far, and 
even though they slumped in 
week three, it isn’t enough to 
convince me to start my bench 
D/ST, the Giants. I still expect 
my Jets to be competitive 
against his Seahawks, so the 
defensive match-up should be 
interesting.
And ?nally, I have a con-
fusing soft spot for kicker 
Brian McManus. Ever since 
his 18 point performance in 
week one, I’ve just kind of fall-
en in love. He isn’t even that 
much better than Nick Folk, 
who I’ve kept on my bench all 
season, but he’s my star and 
I’ll keep starting him unless 
he gives me a reason not to. 
Ian Tanaya also recently ex-
plained to me that it’s unusual 
for a team to keep two kick-
ers, so I’m considering drop-
ping Folk in order to ?ll a gap 
somewhere else.
After I win this week — 
which I will — I’ll increase 
my streak to two wins and 
stay tied for ?rst place in my 
league. I’m still pretty con-
?dent that as I work out the 
kinks in my team and my own 
fantasy understanding, I’ll be 
a champion.

The NFL just recorded its 
?rst arrest-free month during 
the season for the ?rst time 
in over a decade. Since the 
players aren’t getting them-
selves into trouble, maybe 
now would be a good time to 
change our focus to the short-
comings of the league itself.
Recently the NFL has been 
on the lobbying trail, preemp-
tively ?ghting legislation that 
may come in reaction to Con-
cussion, the Will Smith movie 
set to be released in November.
The movie is set to revolve 
around chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy (CTE), a de-
generative brain condition. 
The Department of Veterans 
Affairs and Boston Univer-
sity jointly conducted a study 
of 91 deceased NFL players 
that found 96 percent of their 
brains showed evidence of 
CTE.
Player safety has been a 
mounting concern for the 
NFL in recent years, and a big-
budget movie could bring the 
controversy to a head. The NFL 
has been taking shots from 
Congress and many others re-
cently, from the controversial 
name of the NFL franchise in 
Washington D.C., the Red-
skins, to repeated instances of 
domestic violence perpetrated 
by players followed by wholly 
inadequate responses from the 
league.The league will be in 
very deep trouble, however, if 
lawmakers decide to go after 
the game the NFL plays.
The NFL’s response to con-
cussions has basically been to 
try and eliminate the scariest 
moments on the ?eld: when a 
player goes down after a huge 
hit and doesn’t get back up. 
Those moments are incredibly 
uncomfortable to watch on 
TV and are obvious remind-
ers of the dangers of football. 
For both reasons, the NFL 
has incentive to reduce their 
frequency.
However, research says 
brain injuries in football — es-
pecially CTE — are not all-at-
once events, usually coming 
as the result of a lifetime of 
blows to the head. The helmet-
to-helmet hit bans and bans 
against hitting a defenseless 
receiver in football do not pre-
vent this buildup of small mo-
ments of trauma.
If Congress takes notice of 
the NFL’s failed response to 
head injuries, two things can 
happen: The ?rst is that Con-
gress can try to legislate mean-
ingful reforms into football. 
This means shorter and fewer 
practices, possibly the elimina-
tion of the kickoff and punt, 
and other things Congress can 
try to think up.
Secondly, Congress can 
target the NFL’s wallet. Con-
gress has serious sway over 
the ?nances of the NFL. Two 
legal distinctions of the NFL 
— its not-for-pro?t status and 
the antitrust exemption that 
allows its franchises to work 
in lockstep — are what make 
the NFL a multi-billion-dollar 
corporation. Being treated as 
a for-pro?t or having its fran-
chises broken up so that the 
?nancial rules are different 
for each team could seriously 
damage the NFL’s brand and, 
more importantly, its wallet.
The NFL knows that this 
?ght is coming and has pre-
pared accordingly. The league 
has a full time lobbying ap-
paratus on the ground in 
Washington already at work. 
They’re spitting out all the old 
“this is all sensationalism and 
the media is a bunch of liars, 
and we’re angels” sound bytes 
we always hear every time 
someone tries to brush an epi-
demic of degenerative brain 
disease among employees un-
der the rug.
With Will Smith and his 
movie shining extra light on 
the struggles of former NFL 
players, the NFL better ?nd 
a way to stop the bleeding. 
This bit of good news, that 
no players have committed 
crimes for a calendar month, 
is legitimately good news. 
It’s somewhat hard to ?nd 
1700 people who go an entire 
month committing a total of 
zero crimes. However, while 
we give the players a gold star, 
it is best not to remember the 
“F” we have to give the league 
under the stewardship of com-
missioner Roger Goodell.
If concussions continue to 
be a problem and the league 
just says it cannot ?nd any pos-
sible solution, a blockbuster 
movie-driven Congress might 
not stop at practice schedules. 
Without its nonpro?t distinc-
tion, the NFL will be ?ne. It 
relinquished its tax-exempt 
status in April in what many 
people believe was an attempt 
to be more secretive about ex-
ecutive pay.
However, if it loses its an-
titrust exemption, the large 
amount of money in football 
means that the competitive 
balance in the league could 
be uniformly damaged if the 
?nancial rules become lop-
sided, leading to the destruc-
tion of football as we currently 
know it.

She may only be halfway 
through her college career, 
but sophomore mid?elder 
Morgan Kontor believes she 
is becoming a quiet leader 
on her team. She exempli-
?es how to be a clutch player 
for her team when the time 
comes.
The materials science & 
engineering and biomedical 
engineering double major 
from Annapolis, Md. most 
recently scored an incredible 
game-tying goal in the wan-
ing seconds of a game against 
Capital on Sunday, Sept. 27. 
She headed a beautiful pass 
from her teammate, sopho-
more mid?elder Haili Adams, 
into the top of the goal, forc-
ing the game into overtime 
and ultimately securing her 
team the win. The victory 
continued their impressive 
undefeated streak.
Kontor did not get to this 
moment of success without 
a lifetime of commitment to 
the game. She ?rst stepped 
foot onto the pitch in a neigh-
borhood recreational league 
at the age of ?ve and never 
looked back.
She eventually moved on 
to playing for her high school 
and the Maryland United FC 
before making her journey to 
Carnegie Mellon. Kontor knew 
she had to step her game up 
when she came into the colle-
giate atmosphere. “Everyone 
is good, the game is always 
faster and the teams play bet-
ter together”, Kontor said of 
the transition to collegiate 
athletics. However, with her 
sophomore class constituting 
a large chunk of the team, she 
feels that her team is as co-
hesive as ever and sees even 
better opportunities for suc-
cess emerging in the future 
for her team. When she came 
to the school, her favorite 
part of joining the soccer pro-
gram was the friends she im-
mediately made through her 
teammates, creating a truly 
“authentic family” within the 
team, which is clearly re?ected 
in their outstanding undefeat-
ed record this season.
But not every game has 
been an easy victory, and her 
game-tying goal against Capi-
tal is the epitome of Kontor’s 
success so far at Carnegie 
Mellon. Kontor recalls the 
moment vividly: As the ?nal 
minute of the game ticked 
away, she remembers think-
ing, “There’s no way we’ll 
make it through this with a 
win,” her team being down 
a goal and no immediate so-
lution in sight. The seconds 
continued to tick away, and 
Kontor’s teammate Haili Ad-
ams miraculously dribbled 
through four defenders and 
got a beautiful pass off in 
Kontor’s direction. The next 
few seconds became a blur of 
movement and adrenaline for 
Kontor. “I just got something 
on it,” she said, “I can’t recall 
whether it was my head or 
my shoulder but I got a touch 
and I knew it went in.” The 
team erupted in celebration, 
but the happiness quickly re-
verted to business because the 
game was not over — the goal 
had only been enough to tie 
the game for the Tartans.
Kontor saw things differ-
ently. “We had to win at that 
point. That was only way it 
could happen after that goal,” 
she said. And she was right. 
The Tartans managed to score 
an overtime goal and take the 
victory to continue their un-
defeated season on the wings 
of Kontor’s game-tying goal.
Kontor remains humble 
about the game, though. “I 
was just doing what I needed 
to, being in the right place at 
the right time” she said, and 
she knows it was a collective 
effort of her teammates to 
make that goal happen. She 
said her teammates trust each 
other, and she was impressed 
“by the amount of resilience 
my team showed in staying in 
that game.” But Kontor, along 
with the rest of the Tartan 
women, are looking forward. 
The ultimate goal is to make it 
far into the NCAA tournament 
and possibly win, she says, 
but the team isn’t focused on 
that right now. Kontor says 
the ?rst goal is to win the next 
game, and after that to win 
the UAA conference.
If they take their goals step 
by step, she says, the ultimate 
goal will come easily.
Success for a Carnegie 
Mellon athlete, however, 
must come in both academic 
and athletic forms. When 
asked about how she bal-
ances schoolwork and athlet-
ics, Kontor said she resorts 
to simple time management 
strategies, and emphasized 
that she gets enough sleep at 
all times. She also sees her 
sport as a stress relief mecha-
nism, allowing her to get her 
mind off school when per-
haps the thought might be too 
overwhelming. Kontor is still 
?guring out what she wants 
to do when she graduates, 
but says she would like to be-
come a coach of her own soc-
cer team one day. But for now, 
her team will look to continue 
running the table, and with 
great team synergy and trust 
among everyone, it looks as 
if the Tartan women are on 
track for a perfect season.
Kontor knows she’s the 
clutch player, and wants to be 
along for that ride.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team has got-
ten off to an incredible 7–2–1 
start. Senior goalkeeper Eric 
Bykowsky has been a critical 
part of the effort, having led 
the defense to ?ve shutouts 
this season.
The business administra-
tion major from Columbia, SC 
hasn’t always been a goalie. 
“My parents got me into soc-
cer when I was four, and I kept 
playing all the way up through 
high school,” Bykowsky said, 
recalling the twisting path 
he took to get to this point. “I 
started off as an attacker, but 
they ?gured out I wasn’t fast 
enough.”
As the speed of the game 
got faster, Bykowsky needed 
to make a switch in position. 
“When I was mid?elder, I 
had the endurance, but they 
?gured out I didn’t have the 
foot skills. They moved me to 
defender, where I didn’t even 
have enough skills for that.” 
Despite the constant shift-
ing out of roles, Bykowsky 
remained optimistic about 
staying on the team and play-
ing. “Coach put me in goalie 
for a game, and I ended up 
starting.”
Though Bykowsky played 
for the school team during his 
years in elementary, middle, 
and high schools, he con-
sidered club soccer the true 
competition where he was 
forged in ?re. “I had a coach 
who really pushed me, and 
the hard work I put into it re-
ally prepared me for success 
in college.”
The time he put into soc-
cer helped him utilize his time 
outside the sport ef?ciently. 
Undoubtedly, his investment 
into the sport would pay off. 
“We won the regional cham-
pionship my senior year, and 
we beat a couple of top teams 
in nationals before we lost to 
Michigan.”
Bykowsky believed that 
coming to Carnegie Mellon 
would be a great opportu-
nity. “I knew I wanted to go 
into business, and I wanted 
to play soccer in college. I 
figured since Carnegie Mel-
lon was top 10 in business 
that I’d be a perfect fit here,” 
said Bykowsky. Though 
Bykowsky became quickly 
introduced to the challenge 
of balancing his course load 
and his time with the team, 
he thrived under these con-
straints.
“The interesting thing 
about fall sports is that you’re 
coming in at the most stress-
ful time for you. The time 
commitment for soccer is like 
adding three extra classes to 
your schedule. What it did 
for me was make me keep a 
schedule and get work done 
ahead of time. I actually did 
better in fall than spring aca-
demically. Try to explore as 
many opportunities as pos-
sible, don’t be afraid of a full 
schedule because it can keep 
you disciplined.”
Bykowsky has managed 
to maintain a strong com-
mitment to academics and 
a strong commitment to the 
team. Though many aspects 
of the team have changed 
over the years, he believes 
that the team can go far.
“High level stuff changed 
about the club. We just had a 
new coach come in last year, 
and that was by far the big-
gest change we’ve seen in the 
program. We’ve got a fresh 
set of tactics and are play-
ing cleaner soccer. There’s 
been a lot more discipline 
in the team, and we’re more 
accountable on and off the 
?eld. This year, we’re right 
where we need to be in the 
coaching transition, and our 
freshman class is the stron-
gest we’ve had in the past 
four years. I’m very optimis-
tic for this year.”
The Tartans’ great start has 
certainly seen just how well 
the changes have resonated 
with the team. The ?rst game 
of the season against Musk-
ingum University was the ?rst 
chance to show their competi-
tion what the new team was 
made of, and the resounding 
8-0 victory kicked off the sea-
son with a bang.
The Tartans have been 
able to thrive against strong 
competition, including a 
4-3 victory against the then-
number three ranked Mes-
siah College. Though the road 
ahead will continue to pro-
vide challenges for the team, 
the performances so far given 
by Bykowsky and the team in-
dicate that they are ready to 
take on anyone.
The ?nal season for the se-
nior goalkeeper will certainly 
be one to remember.

In the spring, Carnegie 
Mellon Ph.D. and junior fac-
ulty member Sam Ventura 
took a consulting job with the 
Pittsburgh Penguins. His path 
there is exemplary as a Carn-
egie Mellon success story. He 
started as a hockey fan and 
eventually, through working 
with former Carnegie Mellon 
statistics professor Andrew 
Thomas, turned that interest 
into being employed at the 
highest level of the sport.
Ventura’s rise to the Pen-
guins began with hockey sta-
tistics site War-on-ice, a site 
he created with Thomas. “An-
drew and I ?rst started talking 
about hockey when he taught 
[a] sports statistics class,” said 
Ventura, referring to a mini 
course offered by Thomas in 
Ventura’s senior year.
Sports statistics have a 
long history, but until recent-
ly, as Ventura pointed out, 
many methods are not suf?-
cient to tell the story of what 
occurs on the ice. “We were 
talking about how existing 
methods to rate players offen-
sively and especially defen-
sively were lacking.”
From those conversations 
emerged War-on-ice, which 
became the most well-known 
and comprehensive database 
for hockey statistics on the 
web.
Ventura and Thomas start-
ed by downloading the NHL’s 
play-by-play ?les and logging 
not just goals and assists but 
also things like takeaways, 
blocked shots, and the loca-
tion of the puck during each 
of the events.
Through all of the infor-
mation, the two created “a set 
of metrics that would provide 
a statistical rating for players 
offensively and defensively,” 
according to Ventura. That 
statistical rating became what 
many believe is hockey’s most 
powerful tool for evaluating 
players.
The metric measures the 
change in a team’s goal scor-
ing rate when a player is on 
the ice for offensive rating. 
For defensive rating, it mea-
sures the rate of goals conced-
ed by a player’s team when 
that player is on the ice. It 
controls for factors like “score 
state… and also which play-
ers they’re on the ice with…
and which players they are 
playing against.” The paper 
describing the method was 
published in The Annals of 
Applied Statistics.
The site’s expansion be-
gan when Thomas organized 
a hockey analytics panel at 
the Joint Statistical Meetings 
in 2014. Michael Schuck-
ers, Brian McDonald, Kevin 
Mongeon, and Mike Lopez — 
some of the foremost minds 
in hockey analytics — joined 
Ventura, and Thomas dis-
cussed hockey analytics on 
the panel. “There was a lot 
of question and answer from 
the audience and the ques-
tion that eventually came up 
was, ‘If what you’re doing is 
so great… then why does no-
body use it?’ … and we real-
ized we weren’t doing a very 
good job of marketing what 
we had done,” Ventura said.
At the same time — maybe 
even the same day, according 
to Ventura’s memory — the 
person who ran the leading 
hockey analytics website, 
Extra Skater, was hired for a 
consulting job. “Basically in 
a weekend,” War-on-ice was 
born. Since most of the work 
was done in R, it could be eas-
ily put onto the web.
The site blew up fast. “We 
got a thousand Twitter fol-
lowers without having sent a 
tweet out yet,” Ventura said.
The site was also inter-
active with the community. 
They responded quickly to 
people’s requests, kept the 
site up to date, and even post-
ed metrics that followers may 
have thought up. “That sort 
of got us a lot of trust within 
the online community, which 
I think played a big role in 
popularizing the website,” he 
said.
Ventura and Thomas built 
the website to survive after 
they had moved on. War-on-
ice is still being run despite 
both statisticians now work-
ing as consultants for teams, 
making the website a con?ict 
of interest.
Ventura also acts as the fac-
ulty advisor for Tartan Sports 
Analytics, a club on campus 
for students with an inter-
est in sports analytics. “They 
all have great ways of think-
ing about the different sports 
and they’re all pretty talented 
from the statistics perspective 
as well, which is hard to com-
bine,” Ventura said about the 
articles the club publishes.
Ventura is currently an as-
sistant coach for the club ice 
hockey team, and he is try-
ing to recreate War-on-ice 
for their league. However, 
getting a consulting job for a 
professional hockey team is 
a strong af?rmation of how 
important Ventura’s thoughts 
have been to the world of 
hockey analytics.
JORDAN SAFER
Junior Staffwriter
A leader on the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s tennis team, 
senior Abishek Alla feels that 
playing for the tennis team 
gives him an outlet for com-
petition outside of the class. 
The civil and environmen-
tal engineering major from 
Hyderabad, India has show-
cased dominant play over the 
last couple years, competed 
as the Tartan’s number one 
singles player for the past two 
seasons, and been named an 
All-American in singles both 
years.
When discussing his 
choice to participate with 
the team, he called attention 
to the break tennis provides 
from a day full of academic 
activities. Alla embraces his 
participation in tennis for the 
sheer enjoyment of being on 
top of the sport’s competition.
“I’m playing more seri-
ously only because that’s a re-
lease from academics and it’s 
more to fun to be on the court 
than to be somewhere else,” 
said Alla.
In high school, Alla com-
peted at a sports academy 
where athletics was a focus. 
Coming to Carnegie Mellon 
was a big change, but luckily 
he made the adjustment suc-
cessfully.
“I came in prepared for 
[school] to be harder and 
then I guess it started going 
off well the ?rst few weeks, 
and then it just kept going 
that way.”
Entering school at Carn-
egie Mellon poses challenges 
for many ?rst-year students 
unfamiliar with the workload, 
and Alla noted that this makes 
it especially dif?cult for ath-
letes at the university to bal-
ance their time well.
Late in the season, he 
pointed out, there is impor-
tance in “staying on top of all 
the academics so it doesn’t af-
fect the playing in UAAs [the 
University Athletics Associa-
tion Conference Champion-
ships]”.
However, he also observed 
that the impact of sports can 
be a great positive force on 
the athletes in season. When 
in season, athletes learn to do 
work ef?ciently for their class-
es, using time outside of prac-
tice better while operating un-
der the added time pressure.
“I couldn’t see myself not 
playing. If I wasn’t playing 
tennis I feel like I’d have a lot 
of free time,” Alla said. Alla 
explained that since tennis 
teaches the players about “un-
consciously ?nishing work,” 
when they aren’t playing; 
there is a lot of free time.
This makes a good les-
son for the younger athletes, 
since, Alla said, the younger 
members of the team are still 
learning to manage the differ-
ent academic load and ?nd 
balance with other activities. 
Alla sees losing sleep as the 
big pitfall to a student athlete 
looking to succeed in school 
and in tennis.
He advises that “if you’re 
spending too much time on 
a problem you should just go 
to the TA [teaching assistant] 
and ask for help or just email 
someone instead of staying up 
for 12 hours doing it on your 
own.”
Successfully adjusting to 
the academic workload will 
be key for the tennis team this 
season, with a strong ?rst-
year presence on the team 
that’s sure to be large part of 
the winning formula.
Alla explains that a strong 
work ethic from the ?rst-years 
on the team this season is 
making up for the loss of three 
of last years seniors from 
the varsity team and giving 
the team a chance to “make 
history.”
Alla views this weekend’s 
upcoming ITA regional tour-
nament in Fredericksburg 
Virginia as a good test of how 
both he and the team stack 
up competitively against the 
competition. In the singles 
tournament, he expects 
strong competition, both 
with rival tennis players, like 
a strong player from John’s 
Hopkins University who Alla 
believes is likely to take the 
top seed in the draw, and with 
teammates. He anticipates 
many of the tough matches 
to come against other strong 
Carnegie Mellon tennis play-
ers who will also play in the 
tournament.
In addition to being able 
to cope with added academic 
responsibility, Alla explains 
the signi?cance of the coach-
ing staff in allowing the tennis 
players from both the men’s 
and women’s teams to train 
ef?ciently through the sea-
son. The tennis coaching staff 
must deal with limited court 
openings throughout the day, 
needing to organize times for 
all athletes on both tennis 
teams to take advantage of 
the courts closed to public use 
during the day.
On the whole, Alla’s expe-
rience handling tennis along 
with a typical student work-
load helps him succeed both 
on and off the court.

Trevor Noah shows his chops
New host of The Daily Show not quite as wry as Jon Stewart
Last week, The Daily Show returned after a two-
month hiatus to continue the “war on bullshit.” New 
host Trevor Noah, replacing longtime captain Jon 
Stewart, who departed the show in August after 17 
years, immediately acknowledged that he had big 
shoes to fill. “I can only assume this is as strange for 
you as it is for me,” said the South Africa native. “Jon 
Stewart was more than just a late-night host. He was 
often our voice, our refuge, and in many ways our 
political dad. And it’s weird, because Dad’s left, and 
there’s a new stepdad. And he’s black. Which is not 
ideal.”
Many small details about the show have changed, 
including the logo and graphics, but much of it 
remains the same. The format, structure, and theme 
song remain, as well as some familiar correspondents 
including Jordan Klepper and Hasan Minhaj, and 
the always-fantastic “Moment of Zen” to close the 
show. The segments are still hilarious puns, and the 
targetboard is familiar. The structure of the script 
is so similar you can almost hear Stewart doing the 
show in your head.
There’s no doubt, however, that this is a different 
show, and that’s felt in Noah.
He’s got an incredibly charming smile that stretches 
from ear to ear, and it combined with his demeanor 
presents an image of a boy shoved into the spotlight; 
he wouldn’t want to be anywhere else but at the 
same time can’t wait for it to be over. There’s a 
certain sense of discomfort in the first few episodes, 
and Noah handles some elements of the show as if 
he’s not quite comfortable in his surroundings.
For example, his interview with New Jersey 
Governor Chris Christie on last Wednesday’s episode 
felt too much like a stump for the Republican 
presidential candidate to shout from, compared 
to what fans expect from The Daily Show. The 
topic focused on Christie’s plan to implement 
a thumbprint system to document and control 
immigration, and where Stewart would’ve certainly 
had a few opinions of his own on the issue, Noah 
stood back, smiled politely, and asked questions 
that gave Christie control. Hopefully Noah grows 
comfortable enough in his new role to treat his 
guests with a little bit less than perfect hospitality.
With Jon Stewart’s departure and Stephen Colbert’s 
recent move as David Letterman’s replacement on 
The Late Show, it appears that Comedy Central’s 
late night programming has entered a new era. 
Stewart and Colbert established themselves as the 
smart alecks throwing spitballs in the back of the 
room, an intelligent alternative to the big network 
late night shows that vanilla-up their jokes to appeal 
to a wide audience (an establishment Colbert has 
now joined). Now, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah 
and its timeslot chaser The Nightly Show with 
Larry Wilmore, essentially have to start over again. 
Hopefully as the writing staff grows more familiar 
with their new host, Noah will stop feeling like a 
replacement stepdad and become more like the dad 
Stewart was. Because the “war on bullshit” must 
continue, or else we’ll become lost in a sea of fear-
mongering, and politicians will go without hilarious 
nicknames. We can’t have that.
The Daily Show airs weeknights on Comedy Central 
at 11 p.m. Episodes are posted on cc.com the next 
day for free.

Advice for awkward people
Hi, Josh!
My parents don’t love me 
any more. I’m from Arizona, 
but I have been living out 
here in Pittsburgh since 
I started college (I’m a 
sophomore, by the way). 
I went home this week to 
surprise my parents for 
their anniversary, and when 
I got to my house, I found 
that nobody was home 
and all of the locks had 
been changed, so I waited 
outside for my parents to 
get home. 
When a car pulled into the 
driveway, I ran up to greet 
my parents, but the people 
who stepped out of the car 
weren’t them. They were 
an older couple. I explained 
that this was my house, 
and they just laughed and 
told me that they were 
renting from my parents. 
They let me in to see the 
house, and the couple 
told me that my parents 
had turned my bedroom 
into a sewing room and 
clutter repository. Long 
story short, my parents are 
living in Vermont during 
the fall and renting the 
house out until I come 
home for Christmas, and 
they didn’t tell me, and they 
messed up my room, and 
they hid all of my stuff in 
the basement under a pile 
of old quilts, and they’re 
acting like what we had 
in that house didn’t mean 
anything to them. Those 
walls have seen some stuff, 
Josh.
The Rodriguezes don’t 
know the history; they 
don’t know about the time 
I wrote emotional song 
lyrics above my bed with 
permanent marker when 
I was going through my 
scene phase. They just sew 
their charity blankets for 
the under-privileged elderly 
in ignorance.
Tl;dr, how do I get my 
parents to let me into their 
lives and tell me things and 
love me again?
Signed,
Sorely Alienated Daughter,
Staunchly Anti-Change Kid
Dear SAD SACK,
I’m sorry your parents didn’t 
tell you that they were renting 
out the house, but maybe they 
didn’t tell you because they 
thought you’d be upset. The 
fact that they come back for 
Christmas is evidence of their 
love for you (and the bone-
chilling, icy horror characteristic 
of New England winters). It’s 
not that they don’t love you, 
but maybe that they’re free to 
relocate for a few months while 
you’re busy at school. I’m 
sure that your parents didn’t 
mean any harm in keeping the 
Rodriguezes’ existence from 
you. I’ve also struggled with 
the change of my old room 
into a guest room, but that’s 
just the natural progression 
of life after a kid goes off to 
college. In my opinion, you 
should call your parents and 
talk through this with them 
— I’m sure that will settle the 
issue and put your mind at 
ease.
Sincerely, 
Joshua Brown.

I’m of the ?rm belief that a solid offering of snacks 
has the potential to elevate an awkward red Solo cup 
“rager” to a nice cozy evening with friends. That’s 
why when I throw a party, I like to put out some noms. 
It shows friends that you care about their experience 
in your home, and it’s always good to put food in 
the tummies of the people who hold the fate of your 
furniture in their hands.
An assortment of dips is a really great way to feed 
guests. It’s more effort than simply putting out a 
few bags of chips, but it’s way more delicious. A 
simple Pinterest search is enough to show you the 
mouth-watering range of dips out there, from savory 
to sweet, from a simple three-ingredient delight to 
a complicated layered delicacy, depending on your 
budget and time constraints.
But with these three dips that I made for my birthday 
party, I didn’t have to spend that much money and I 
pulled them all together in the hour before the party 
began. They were super delicious and very easy! I 
opted for all savory because that’s what I like to eat, 
and it was my party. It was also great that all of them 
were served with tortilla chips, so that made life 
simple.
The ?rst is an avocado dip that’s actually not 
guacamole. It’s a creamier spin on the universally 
adored classic. By adding cream cheese and sour 
cream, it ?uffs up the dip and gives it a deeper ?avor. 
Plus,  that’s volume that doesn’t come from avocados, 
and that equals money saved! Unfortunately the 
avocados that I bought were horri?cally underripe, so 
I have faith that this recipe will yield something better 
than what I made.
Avocado Party Dip
8 ounces of cream cheese
8 ounces of sour cream
½ teaspoon of garlic salt
1 ripe large avocado or 2 small ones, pitted and peeled
¼ cup of chopped red onion
1 tablespoon of lemon or lime juice
This recipe is much easier if you have an electric 
mixer, which I do thanks to my beautiful grandmother. 
If you don’t, I’m so sorry because the ?rst step, 
creaming the cream cheese, requires serious shoulder 
and tricep muscles to do by hand. Follow that up by 
mixing in the sour cream and garlic powder and don’t 
stop until it’s ?uffy. Then beat in the avocado until it’s 
combined with the creamy love pillow. Finally, hand 
stir the onions and lime juice. I personally chose to stir 
in a couple teaspoons of salt too, but you can do that 
to taste.
Cheesy Beer Dip
12 ounces of beer
8 ounces of cream cheese
1 cup of shredded cheddar
Buzzfeed recommended using Corona, but I happened 
to already have some really high quality month-old 
Keystone Light on hand. The dip still turned out 
delicious in spite of it. Start by bringing the beer to 
a simmer over medium heat in a small sauce pan. It 
will get really fun and foamy, and that’s how you know 
it’s time to add the cream cheese. The best way to go 
about this is to soften the cream cheese beforehand, 
and cut it up into chunks so that it melts smoothly. 
Once that’s melted and mixed up, pour in the cheddar 
and stir until it’s a dip. If you’re feeling fancy, which I 
was not, a sprinkling of chopped green onions would 
be a delicious ?nishing touch.
The only small issue with this one is that it’s not ideal 
for leaving out on a table all night. It’s so delicious 
hot, but so weird and congealed after two hours. 
Either serve it immediately, serve it in a crock pot, or 
periodically microwave it.
Best for last… Fiesta Ranch Dip
1 packet of Hidden Valley ranch seasoning mix
16 ounces of sour cream
10 ounce can of Rotel Original (tomatoes and green 
chiles)
11 ounce can of corn (I used a can that had a mix of 
yellow and sweet corn)
¾ cup of shredded cheese
Pour everything in a bowl and stir! It’s literally as easy 
as that, adding to my sincere love for this dip. It was 
also the ?rst one to completely disappear, much to 
my despair. I need to add that I could truly eat this 
for breakfast, lunch, mid-afternoon snack, dinner, 
and late-night snack until my digestive system fails. 
It was to die for in every way. The mixture of the 
ranch seasoning with the acidity of the tomatoes, 
the sweetness of the corn and general perfection of 
cheddar hit all my sweet spots. The only thing that 
could have made it better was maybe some ground 
beef, which I will likely try as early as tonight because 
the craving is overwhelming.
I also ended up adding a box of Oreos to the mix, 
just in case any guests came with a sweet tooth. The 
whole spread made the evening so much nicer than it 
could have been without, and everyone who came did 
express their appreciation. Seeing friends leave happy 
is a beautiful birthday gift in itself.

Warm yourself with autumnal comfort food
As the cold weather quickly approaches, delicious meals await with seasonal ingredients
Sure, barbecues are fun and snow cones are delicious, 
but the best season for food is de?nitely autumn. It’s 
easy to feel a little down when the days become cold 
and rainy, and when every time you come home you 
have to throw your socks in the dryer, but a bad day can 
quickly become a good one with delicious food. Here are 
a few easy recipes to include in a warm meal ?lled with 
comfort food to turn around a miserable homework-?lled 
day.
I love soup more than I love people. Most of the time. 
Soup is often easy to make and it can last you a while. I 
fell in love with this soup after eating a variation of it at 
Eat Unique last fall. While the ?rst few times were only 
okay, I eventually mastered this recipe and now make it 
as often as I can.
Pumpkin Pear Bisque
2 leeks, sliced
1 sweet onion, chopped
2 tbsp butter
3 tbsp ?our
4 cups chicken broth
15 oz. pumpkin (canned)
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
3 canned pear halves
1 cup pear syrup, from can
1/2 cup light cream
Lula’s additions: 2 fresh pears, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 qt apple 
cider
I originally found this recipe on Food.com, but I make 
some alterations to the ingredients above. I’m a little 
more generous with salt and pepper, and I’m more 
conservative with the nutmeg — especially after a 
nutmeg overload, which was not delicious. I also use 
fresh pears, because I feel like they’d be tastier. I try to 
buy them as ripe as I can ?nd. While this leads to no pear 
syrup, I poach the pears in apple cider to give them a bit 
of an extra fall ?air. Then I use a little apple cider, a half 
cup or so, as the “pear syrup.”
First, melt the butter with the leeks and onions in a big 
saucepan. When they are nearly cooked, add the ?our for 
just a minute or so, and then add all the chicken broth. 
Cook on medium heat for a while, until the broth begins 
to boil. Add in the pumpkin, vanilla, salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg. When the soup begins to boil again, turn down 
the heat and cover for about 20 minutes. While it is 
simmering, poach the pears. This means dissolving the 
sugar into the apple cider in the pan, adding the pears 
— I do three to four halves — and then cooking at a low 
boil for about another 20 minutes. Since this is the same 
amount of time as the soup itself, it is good to already 
have the sugar and apple cider heating on a back burner.
When the pears are tender, transfer them to the soup. I 
also add about half a cup of the apple cider. It is easiest 
to blend the soup if you own a hand blender, but you can 
also put it in a food processor or blender in four different 
batches. After it is blended to a smooth consistency, add 
the cream and a little more vanilla, as well as more salt 
and pepper if desired.
Enjoy your soup! This recipe can feed generous portions 
to around four people, so invite your friends over and feel 
less alone.
Fall is also apple season, one of the best fruits to grace 
the earth. While this dessert tastes best after you make 
it after a long day of apple picking, you can also make it 
using store bought apples. Apple crumble is one of the 
best things to make, because it is really, really dif?cult to 
mess up. Crumble of any consistency tastes great, and 
the more butter used, the tastier it seems. So while I give 
measurements here, I usually just mush it around until it 
feels right, and I have yet to be disappointed.
Apple Crumble
5-7 apples, depending on apple size
1 1/4 cup oatmeal
1 cup ?our
8 tbsp butter
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 lemon, juice
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tbsp ?our (additional)
pinch of salt

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. The ?rst task after 
that is the most boring: peeling and chopping the 
apples. Try to have a vegetable peeler on hand; it is so 
much easier than a knife. Put the apples in 9x13 baking 
dish; Pyrex is by far the best. Toss the apples with the 
white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon, the juice 
from the lemon, and the ?our. Put the wonderful smelling 
apple compote aside.
In another bowl, mix the butter, one cup ?our, oatmeal, 
brown sugar, one teaspoon cinnamon, and pinch of salt. 
It is most effective if the butter is thoroughly thawed, 
and if you use your ?ngers. When the mixture is the 
consistency you desire — reminder: it will be delicious 
regardless — sprinkle or spread it on top of the apple 
mixture. Pop the tray in the oven for about 45 minutes, 
or until it is bubbly and sweet-smelling. Serve with 
vanilla ice cream if you so desire.
With these two recipes, hopefully you can improve a 
chilly fall day. Other fun recipes to join your soup and 
apple dessert might be gooey homemade mac & cheese, 
kale and white bean ragout, and maybe freshly baked 
banana bread.

For a sci-? movie about a lone survivor on a desert 
planet, The Martian is a decidedly atypical movie for 
director Ridley Scott, one of the original sci-? auteurs. 
Scott’s greatest works, such as Alien and Blade Runner, 
are bleak, dystopian meditations on the fragility of 
humanity against the uncertain backdrop of the future. 
With The Martian, Scott swings the opposite way — 
utopian storytelling. The Martian is a celebration of 
human ingenuity and unwavering determination in the 
face of seemingly insurmountable odds.
In the near future, a manned mission to Mars is 
prematurely terminated when a massive dust storm 
hits the mission base. In the confusion of the moment, 
crew member Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) 
is injured and presumed dead. Watney wakes up, 
stranded on desolate Mars all by himself, after the 
rest of his crew blasted off into space on their return 
voyage. He must ?gure out how to make contact with 
NASA, and how to make his supplies, originally meant 
to last weeks, last him years. As Watney remarks, he 
needs to “science the shit out of this” if he has any 
hope of surviving.
For a movie with a theme best described as “Robinson 
Crusoe meets Apollo 13,” The Martian is unexpectedly 
upbeat. Scott never lets his audience lose track of the 
gravity of the situation; yet, he infuses his settings with 
subtle humor at just the right moments, presenting 
Watney not as a tortured soul, but as someone in on 
the wry joke of just how much trouble he’s in. Watney 
is an idealized symbol of perseverance and ingenuity: 
He refuses to give in, and somehow, by hook or crook, 
always manages to ?nd a way. He recycles his own 
waste to fertilize potatoes, burns rocket fuel to create 
water, and, in general, manages to get by until the next 
inevitable disaster (Martian frost, chemical explosions) 
upends his plans.
Matt Damon as Watney is near perfect. He carries the 
entire ?rst half of the ?lm by himself. Giving his best 
performance since Scorsese’s The Departed, Damon 
loses himself in Mark Watney, ?uidly switching from 
fear to anguish, from loneliness to determination, and 
eventually joy. He makes Watney’s emotional highs 
and lows relatable in a scenario that none of us have 
ever been in. The rest of the cast, an A-list cast if there 
ever was one, including Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, 
Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, and Kate Mara — work 
well together as a foil to Damon’s solitude. Besides 
Damon, Jessica Chastain deserves special mention for 
the poignancy she brings to her role as the mission 
commander who makes the dif?cult decision to leave 
Mark Watney behind and then ultimately must live with 
her decision when she learns that he is still alive.
Most interestingly, The Martian works as a paean to 
NASA and space exploration. This is particularly ironic 
when one considers that the movie is about a mission 
in space gone horribly wrong. The guys at NASA 
on Earth and Watney on Mars react exemplarily — 
innovative and bold, they bend technology and nature 
to their will to get Watney back. The scenes on Earth 
could so easily have devolved into a bunch of brains 
spouting pseudo-scienti?c jargon without any soul, or 
into heavy handed Armageddon-style trite heroics that 
cater to the audience of lowest common denominators.
Instead, they manage to straddle a ?ne line between 
seeming scienti?cally accurate and asking really big 
human questions of the cast and the audience. How 
much should the returning crew know about Watney’s 
condition? On the one hand, they deserve to know 
that he is alive; on the other, the last thing a crew 
needs is the emotional distress of knowing that they 
inadvertently marooned one of their own — especially 
since they still have to get back to Earth, in a situation 
where the smallest mistake can cost everyone their 
lives. Should the head of NASA, played by Jeff Daniels, 
authorize an emergency mission with a low probability 
of success to return to Mars in an attempt to save 
Watney?
The Martian isn’t perfect, but it is undoubtedly a 
triumph. The story is a bit too linear, everyone is a bit 
too well-intentioned, and the optimism and constant 
wisecracking is a bit too unrealistic considering the 
circumstances. And yet, from the sound design to 
the visuals to watching the problem-solving unfold, 
everything just seems to work. Every soaring aerial shot 
of the desolate Martian landscape is complemented by 
the intimate landscape of a face. The movie manages 
to strike this incredibly delicate balance between 
cold hard logic and raw emotion — kind of like space 
exploration itself, right?

Marvel President Kevin Feige comments on 
superhero ?lms
Marvel President Kevin Feige is a special kind of movie 
producer. Producers know how to talk to the press, 
what to say, what not to say, and when to say it. They 
know which actors to talk to, who their agents are, how 
much to pay them, how long to pay them for, what their 
costumes should look like and where the story should go. 
So what makes Feige different? Most producers are not 
recognized by name. Marvel fans know who Kevin Feige 
is and understand that the Marvel Cinematic Universe 
was born and raised inside his head. We’re now twelve 
?lms deep in the Marvel Comic Universe (MCU), and 
Feige is still revealing his thoughts in spectacular 
fashion.
In an interview with IGN, Feige spoke to some 
comments made about superhero ?lms — “that they 
would soon go by the way of the Western” — and the 
future of the MCU. Feige said: “ ... the Western lasted 
40-50 years, and they still pop up occasionally. It’s been, 
what, eight years since Iron Man 1, if we count that, 
which I do, as the beginning of our MCU? Maybe [the 
superhero genre] will only last another 42 years.”
He added: “ ... I still believe the same thing, which is as 
long as the ones that we can control are as good as they 
can be, that’s all that I care about. I think we’ve been 
doing pretty well. I’m very con?dent in the ?lms we’ve 
announced that we have coming forward that they’re 
going to be surprising and different and unique. I’ve 
said a lot; I don’t believe in the comic book genre. I don’t 
believe in the superhero genre. I believe that each of our 
?lms can be very different.”
Feige’s comments make perfect sense when we take a 
look back into history. For example, Feige hired director 
James Gunn to spearhead 2014’s summer hit Guardians 
of the Galaxy. Gunn had previously directed two feature 
?lms: Slither and Super. Feige has repeatedly talked 
about how his decision to hire Gunn was obvious. He 
continuously looks for the best storytellers, regardless 
of the “superhero” stereotype. He looks for unique ways 
to best tell these stories and has been, on the whole, 
successful .
Is Vin Diesel directing Furious 8?
Vin Diesel is, without question, one of the busiest actors 
in the game right now. With The Last Witch Hunter 
getting its release soon, Diesel is also lined up for xXx: 
The Return of Xander Cage, director Ang Lee’s Billy 
Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, 
and, of course, Furious 8. Furious 7’s director James Wan 
is busy with The Conjuring 2: The En?eld Poltergeist, 
and Fast and Furious 3-6 director Justin Lin is busy with 
Star Trek Beyond, so the Fast and Furious franchise is 
once again attempting to bring the family back together. 
Diesel and Lin have been meeting with Universal 
Studios to discuss directors and Rob Cohen (The Fast 
and the Furious) has been mentioned in a number of 
reports, though other reports count him out.
What other name has been mentioned? Diesel himself. 
He took to his Facebook page to make some interesting 
comments: “I will share something crazy that my mother 
said six months ago after the studio had me announce 
the date for 8 to the world … ‘Either you direct 8 yourself 
… or don’t do it.’ Some of you Vinbook pioneers are all 
too familiar with my mother’s wisdom, as I have posted 
her sayings in the past on our page … but I wrote it off 
as just a mother’s love and belief in me, though she has 
seen ?rst hand what I’ve done to make these movies 
defy expectations and become increasingly successful, 
even when the studio thought I was crazy.”
Diesel has a deep emotional — and professional — 
interest in the franchise, and has been ?ghting to keep 
it alive and kicking. A producer on each ?lm since the 
fourth installment, Diesel is rightfully involved in all 
director talks and understands the franchise more than 
virtually anyone. Whether or not he holds the other 
essential tools of a director isn’t clear, but his passion 
for the success of Furious 8 and beyond makes him an 
obvious consideration to sit in the chair.
Kingsman sequel could hit a speed bump
Kingsman: The Secret Service was a success on a variety 
of levels, but one in particular could put the inevitable 
sequel in trouble: the blastoff of Taron Egerton’s career. 
Since starring as Eggsy, the actor was snatched up to 
star in Lionsgate’s Robin Hood: Origins. With Lionsgate 
putting the ?lm on the fast track, Egerton’s two-?lm 
contract for Kingsman may put his role in jeopardy. Both 
?lms are set for an early 2016 production schedule and 
Egerton’s role in Kingsman could knock him off Robin 
Hood: Origins. I’d obviously love to see him back as 
Eggsy, but Robin Hood: Origins seems like it could be 
interesting as well. Hopefully Hollywood throws the 
young actor a bone so that he can execute his role in 
both ?lms.
Egerton can be seen as Teddy Smith in the upcoming 
gangster-drama Legend starring Tom Hardy and Emily 
Browning.

How To Get Away with Murder (HTGAWM) — a product of 
the ShondaLand powerhouse — is one of the most buzzed-
about shows on television right now, and for good reason. A 
week before HTGAWM launched its second season on ABC, 
lead Viola Davis became the ?rst black woman ever to take 
home the primetime Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a 
Drama. She took the opportunity to give a truly inspirational 
speech about mainstream TV’s diversity problem: she 
quoted Harriet Tubman, acknowledged other black TV 
actresses who have helped pave the road forward, and drew 
tears from many in the audience.  
There’s no doubt in my mind that HTGAWM is one of the 
most diverse shows out there, comparable with Orange is 
the New Black and Sense8. To be honest, that’s the main 
reason why I clicked on the ?rst episode after the Emmys 
aired. I had no real idea what the show was about, but I’m 
one of those people who, upon hearing the word “diversity” 
applied to anything, comes running. I wasn’t disappointed. 
In the core cast of Davis’s Annalise Keating and her ?ve 
law student interns, there’s only one white, straight man. 
Interracial and queer relationships abound; the healthiest 
couple on the show is undoubtedly Connor and Oliver: a 
white, gay man and his Asian, HIV-positive boyfriend. As 
a matter of fact, Oliver is currently TV’s only HIV-positive 
character.
Most other primetime shows would’ve hit their minority 
“quota” at half of HTGAWM’s cast of color and queer 
characters and patted themselves on the back. It’s 
incredibly refreshing to watch a show that responds to 
accusations of playing the “political correctness game” with 
even more diversity. Not only are Annalise’s main clients 
for season two an Asian and black brother-sister duo, but 
the very ?rst episode of HTGAWM establishes the main 
character as bisexual — Annalise is almost alone in this 
status, with the exception of Clarke from the CW’s The 100. 
There’s no warning, no fanfare, no nothing — except the 
sudden appearance of an ex-girlfriend, played by Famke 
Janssen, a.k.a. Jean Gray from X-Men. All hail Shonda 
Rhimes and the writing team of this show for being so 
blasé about media representation. Even if HTGAWM hasn’t 
checked off every box, this show has proven that it doesn’t 
take a spectacle to bring real-world diversity to the screen.
So, this show is diverse — but is it good? It’s certainly 
mastered the art of pulling you in with suspense and drama. 
Just ask my sleep schedule two weeks ago, during which I 
watched the entire 15-episode ?rst season in two sittings. 
After I’d depleted Net?ix’s supply of episodes, a brief 
Google search told me that the second season was starting 
the next day, so escape was more or less futile.
HTGAWM is a cross between Legally Blonde and Law 
& Order plus murder. Annalise Keating is a cut-throat 
criminal defense attorney and law professor with a team of 
student interns: the “puppy” underdog Wes (Al?e Enoch, 
Harry Potter’s Dean Thomas), master seducer Connor (Jack 
Falahee), yuppie legacy Asher (Matt McGorry), uptight 
princess Michaela (Aja Naomi King), and “the quiet one” 
Laurel (Karla Souza). While each episode features a “case 
of the week,” the underlying mystery for the watcher in the 
?rst season — ?eshed out by a few ?ashbacks or ?ash-
forwards per episode — is how and why the interns are 
going to murder Annalise’s cheating husband Sam.
The pacing is so tight and the acting so compelling that 
I found myself wondering how the show was going to 
continue past the ?rst season. But when the ?nale killed off 
another important character, I realized that I’d been tricked. 
HTGAWM is that kind of show: the type of nail-biting, plot 
twist heavy, “drama for drama’s sake” show that I always try 
to avoid because I get too invested and it hurts me.
Well, it’s too late now; I’m invested. I’ve already streamed 
the ?rst two episodes of the second season, which apply the 
same ?ashback structure to a new murder-related mystery. 
With How to Get Away with Murder, I came for the diversity 
and stayed for the drama. And I’m on a mission to drag 
everyone else down with me.

Andy’s Wine Bar attracts slightly older crowd
Downtown hangout with free jazz an opportunity for evening of music, cocktails, and ambience
Named after Andrew Carnegie — or Andy Warhol, or both, 
it’s never been made quite clear — Andy’s Wine Bar in 
downtown Pittsburgh is a bar with a modern, cosmopolitan 
aesthetic, located in the lobby of the Fairmont Pittsburgh on 
Market Street.
Featuring dark countertops with gold shavings, retro lounge 
chairs, and window-side two-tops with tall, royal blue 
swivel seats, Andy’s radiates “swank” from every inch of 
its decor. Wednesday to Saturday nights, a live jazz band 
performs in the bar, for an extra touch of class. “Jazz at 
Andy’s” is open to the public, is free of charge, and features 
local jazz performers such as Dane Vannatter, Tania Grubbs, 
and Trudy Holler. The band is right there in the lobby 
at ground level, and you can literally sit right beside the 
performers as they are performing. The intimate setting is 
ideal for anyone who is a fan of jazz, and the lobby of the 
hotel offers wonderful acoustics for pleasurable listening. 
However, if you are completely uncultured like me and 
know next to nothing about jazz, the bar also offers other 
treats as well, including lots of alcohol.
Despite being marketed as a wine bar, wine is hardly the 
main selling point at Andy’s; the wine menu is relatively 
limited and what is available seems somewhat overpriced. 
However, the bar does offer a mix of interesting cocktails 
which start at $9 and up and includes some interesting 
items such as the Thai Vesper, which is a Beefeater 24 
gin with coconut Lilette Blanc; the Bacon Shrub, a bacon 
infused Maker’s Mark; and a seasonal warm spiced wine, a 
cinnamon and orange cabarnet with butternut puree.
I got the Peach Ancho Mojito made with Mount Gay rum, 
while my friend ordered the Meal Undone, a Belvedere 
vodka infused with ginger. The cocktails are ?avorful and 
punchy, and the menu seems to change up often, so there 
should be some new concoctions to try within a few weeks 
or so. What’s more, each order of drink comes with a colorful 
little Warhol-style coaster that has the face of Andrew 
Carnegie on one sided for those whose quest to collect free 
stuff with Andrew Carnegie’s face on it is never complete.
The food menu also contains some interesting items. It 
includes small appetizers and desserts such as pierogies, 
cheeses, and espresso ice cream, as well as burgers, sliders, 
and salads. I ordered some very nice lamb sliders, which 
came with feta cheese, beets, and tahini sauce. However, in 
general the appetizers and desserts seem to be somewhat 
more inventive and exciting than the entrees, so I would 
stick with those. The food service was also pretty slow; I 
waited over 25 minutes for my sliders when the bar was 
only about half full.
Unfortunately, the offerings at Andy’s do run a bit pricey, 
especially for a broke college student. It’s perhaps for this 
reason, and the fact that it is located downtown, that the 
crowd at Andy’s seems to be mostly over 30. During the 
early evening, there are a number of working professionals 
in suits and ties leaving work to get a drink, and those are 
about the youngest people you’ll ?nd there throughout the 
night. It can be charming to see a couple or two waltzing 
around in an open space while the jazz band plays in the 
background every now and then, but the sheer number of 
older patrons after 10 p.m. can make a 20-something feel 
rather out of place.
Still, if you don’t mind hanging around with people who 
may be your parents’ age, or if you’re a fan of jazz or 
?ne cocktails, Andy’s is a nice place to relax after a long 
week, especially before the bar becomes too full. It has a 
wonderful, classy ambiance and is located in a beautiful 
area of downtown with many good restaurants nearby, 
such as Meat & Potatoes and Primanti Brothers. Also, if 
the cocktails run a bit expensive, there are also a selection 
of beers that go for around $2 during Happy Hours. Their 
October performance schedule is posted on their website, 
for anyone interested in seeing local performers.

When I turned nine years old, I made my ?rst bucket list. 
I proudly told this to my mom, rattling off the random 
assortment of places I would inevitably visit: Africa, Italy, 
Spain, and that big waterfall in Canada. At that point, 
I don’t think she realized she was raising a daughter 
who would go on to save every paycheck for future trips. 
Now, she uses the anecdote to justify my absences 
during winter and summer break when I should be at 
home and am instead “gallivanting around the globe” — 
her words, not mine.
The summer after my sophomore year of high school, 
my best friend and I made a summer bucket list ?lled 
with exciting adventures for 15 year olds. We checked 
off activities like 3 a.m. trips to donut shops, beach 
bon?res, and sleeping under the stars. If you know me, 
you know I like lists. I make to-do lists, grocery lists, 
lists that categorize how and what I need to study when 
preparing for exams. I’ve always considered bucket lists 
a great way to establish my goals and capitalize on the 
opportunities presented to me. They can help turn a 
potentially mundane summer day into a memorable day 
at the beach, for all my fellow Californians out there.
Before leaving for my semester abroad in Chile almost 
three months ago, I obviously made a pre-departure 
bucket list. It included a random assortment of things:
1. Become ?uent in Spanish
2. Visit Patagonia
3. Develop at least one new hobby (Climbing? Sur?ng? 
Chocolate making? All three?)
4. Play soccer with locals
5. Kiss a Chilean
After dinner one night at my host family’s house, I had 
a long conversation with my host dad. He listened to 
me stumble my way through a conversation in Spanish 
about family dynamic, travel, and the recent political 
history of Chile; I told him about my life and about my 
recent adventures. At the end of the conversation, he 
told me “estás buscando algo” meaning “you are looking 
for something.” I think he is right. More than looking for 
experiences to check off a bucket list, I’m looking for 
answers to big questions. I’m looking to be challenged. 
I’m looking for international experiences that will 
inevitably change the way I think about and approach 
situations.
I realize how so incredibly lucky I am to have the 
opportunity to travel as much as I do. I come from a 
?nancially stable background and have the distinct 
privilege of being able to dedicate a majority of the 
money I make to my travel fund. Additionally, my 
amazing mother supports and encourages me each 
time I tell her about volunteering in Central America 
or visiting Europe instead of spending Christmas 
at home. To anyone who has the opportunity and is 
considering study abroad: do it. Travel. Explore. Leave 
your bubble. Push the limits of your comfort zone. You 
don’t necessarily have to leave Pittsburgh to experience 
something new that challenges the way you think, but I 
truly believe that there is something so unique to being 
in a foreign, new place for an extended period of time 
as a young person. For me, Chile was the perfect place 
to spend my study abroad. I wanted conversations that 
address the shortcomings of political ?gures and discuss 
how the world reacts to human rights abuses. I wanted 
to be surrounded by politically active young people who 
speak out, go on strikes, and question authority.
Despite being one of those obnoxious list-lovers, it goes 
without saying that the moments that are completely 
unplanned and unexpected can be some of the best. 
Yesterday, I met up with a few friends for ice cream — at 
one of the world’s top 25 ice cream parlors. If that isn’t 
enough of a reason to visit Chile, what is? We sat in a 
plaza in silence, eating our ice cream and watching 
people pass by. A group of young travelers suddenly 
started playing in a giant drum circle and drew in a 
crowd. People were dancing and tapping their feet along 
to the beat. It was the epitome of Valparaíso in front of 
me: a city of music, passion, travel, accompanied by 
public buses and skateboarders in the background. On 
the way home that evening, I took a public bus, which 
quickly ?lled up with people. With loud music overhead, 
the bus driver took turns alarmingly fast, sending me 
careening into those around me. As I stood, squished in 
the aisle between an older man and some teenage boys, 
I looked down at the peaceful young family in front of 
me. The little baby boy was asleep in his dad’s arms, and 
his mom was drifting in and out of sleep, leaning on her 
partner’s shoulder. In this crazy world, they found peace. 
As the bus climbed Valparaíso’s hills, I stood there with 
a goofy smile on my face, happy that I chose to study in 
this country, during this semester, and happened to get 
on this bus.
