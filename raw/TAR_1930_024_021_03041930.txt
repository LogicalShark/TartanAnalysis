Tartans Defeated By Pitt and

Games

Wayne High Plays Last 
Game With Carnegie 
Tech Floor Squad
.Tuesday, Fcbruaiy 25, Carnegie 
Tcch dropped the final basketball 
game of the three game scries with 
the University of Pittsburgh 47-22. 
The game was featured, as all games 
in which Pitt plays are featured’, by 
the all-around ability of . Captain 
Hyatt of the visitors. He was' all' 
over the floor guarding, shooting 
and passing, but he won for himself 
many friends not by his playing but 
by the manner in which he accepted 
the boo’s (not booze) and jeers of 
the supporters. Let it suffice to say 
that the razz was not warranted and 
is not indicative of the warm spot 
Hyatt holds in the hearts of most 
of the fans.
Pitt succecdcd in getting, an early 
lead by getting four field goals and 
a foul before the Carnegie men could 
properly locate the basket. The Tar­
tans rallied, however, and Nease and 
Webster were’ able to get enough 
points to cut th" early lead of their 
rivals to three points. Hyatt finally 
got his team-mates organized again 
and from this point 011 the Tartans 
did no more scoring with the excep­
tion of one two-pointer, until the 
first period ended, at which time 
Pitt was ahead 19-8.
The second half was almost a 
repetition of the first, but Carnegie 
looked better at times and during 
these all too brief periods the two 
teams would battle on even terms. 
The Panthers would then regain their 
stride and score nearly every time they 
•got the ball, without even losing pos­
session of it. The game ended 47-22, 
but in the estimation of many Car­
negie men Pitt will soon lose her 
superiority in this line.’ of sport. 
With Zeyfuss : and Hyatt, tlic two 
threats of the present Panther lineup 
missing. next year, and to offset any 
added strength our rivals \ may 
gather from the remaining men on 
the squad, we have an intact varsity 
and the best Plebe team we have
had for years.
The lineup is as follows:

Claude H. Bowers 
Will Lecture On 
Religious Freedom
Noted Newspaperman Will 
Address Y. M. H. A. 
on March 4
Newspaperman, author, politician, 
lecturer and historian, Claude H. 
.Bowers, political editor of the New 
York World, comes to lecture here 
this evening in the Morris Ivauf- 
mann Memorial Auditorium, 115 
South Bellefield avenue, on “Thomas 
Jefferson and Religious Freedom.”
With the whole world inflamed 
by the struggle of Russia with the 
Church and the alleged attempt of 
the Soviet Government to destroy 
the Church, no more timely topic 
could have been choscn by Mr. 
Bowers for his talk here tonight 
than "Thomas Jefferson and Re­
ligious Freedom,” and perhaps no 
more competent speaker, since Mr. 
Bowers has been intimately asso­
ciated, not only with the editorial 
opinion of this country as chief 
editorial writer for the New York 
World, but as the keynote speaker 
at the National Democratic Con­
vention in 1928. As author of “This 
Tragic Era" and other books and 
articles, he shows scholarly familiar­
ity with the historical background 
of the present political scene.
Tht Y. M. arid W. I-I. A. has 
also announced the tenth and last 
speaker of the current lecture series 
as-Tom Skeyhill, orator and famous 
poet. He is the man of whom 
Theodore Roosevelt said, "I would 
rather be on the platform with 
1 Tom Skeyhill than- any man I 
know,” and his lecture should prove 
of much interest to all students.

Plebe Regulations 
Subject of Debate
“Resolved: That Plebe Regula­
tions Should Be Continued at Car­
negie,” is the subject of a debate 
to be held in the Faculty* dining 
room of. the Carnegie Inn on 
Thursday, March 6, at 12:30 p. m. 
Elizabeth Lillcy will uphold the 
“Affirmative” and Catherine Mong 
the “Negative.” Open forum will 
follow the' debate.
Freshmen are particularly invited 
to rome and contribute their ideas 
wliichj although determined by cir­
cumstances—and Plebe trial and. 
therefore quite dogmatic, will never­
theless add spice to the open dis­
cussion which follows.
The luncheon meetings are prov­
ing extremely popular and great 
interest is manifested. The mem­
bership to date has been extended 
to 19, although the club is new 
on the campus this year the mem­
bers, under the advisoryship of 
Mr. Lawler, are anxious to enter 
intercollegiate competition in the 
near future. Tentative plans will 
be discussed at the meeting of 
March 6.

CEMENT LECTURE TO 
BE GIVEN MARCH 5
Charles B. Bryant of the Phila­
delphia office of the Portland Ce­
ment Association will give a lecture 
on the “Control of Concrete in the 
Field,” at 8:30 p. m. Wednesday, 
March 5, in the Union.. Although 
this Iccture is a part ,of a special 
course given by the Department of 
Civil Engineering, the public is in­
vited to attend.
The series of which this Iccture 
is a part ,is a short laboratory 
course in design and control of 
concrctc mixtures, which began 
during the latter, part of February. 
It is conducted by.Professor J. M. 
Daniels, of the Department of Civil 
Engineering, and is open to archi­
tects, engineers and contractors. 
Thirty-seven local builders; con­
tractors and ^engineers are attend­
ing the classes.
The course includes and supple­
ments the material presented in a 
similar course which was given in 
1926, 1927 and 1928, by J. W. 
Kelly, of the Portland Cement 
Association. The course, which con­
sists of six sessions,, includes the 
preparation of various batches of 
concrete to show the effect of 
mixing, grading and consistency on 
strength, workability and yield. 
Samples of the various mixtures 
will be tested and measured, and 
careful analysis will be made of 
them.
Carnegie Social Lions Lose
Prestige During Re-Exams
“The war is on—and heaven help 
the craven!” The times have 
changed since the days of resound­
ing battle between men who blind- 
ly fought for the safety of their 
liege; the fight is still on, though 
all the other elements of the fray 
have been altered and modernized. 
The most absorbing battle in our 
lives at present is the struggle with 
exlibris—and ultimately, ex-ains! We 
have no field of action except the 
classroom or the li’l blue book, 
or no liege lord to fight for—in 
their place is only a desire to 
justify our existence as a collegian 
(and, in some cases, to atone for 
the sacrifice incurred by the bi­
annual demands of Carnegie’s 
Chancellor of the Exchequer as a 
penalty for our attendance.)
Twice a year this war is on, 
and the profsr if they are malicious­
ly inclined, have plenty of time to 
prove that "There ain’t no justice!” 
The net result is the necessity of
exposure to the hatred rc-cxam 
(to atone for lack of sufficient 
knowledge, that temporary lapse 
of memory, or results occasioned 
by too great a familiarity with the 
tiny hours of ye delightful a. m.) 
All the pent up wrath of profes­
sors ruthlessly descends on the 
hapless individual who, having 
been D’d or E’d all semester, has 
bcnightcdly F’d himself into this 
scrapc. lie is confronted with the 
Unanswerable, in the form of a 
re-cxam. (Some Pollyannian souls 
—(there’s always one running loose 
some where!—may assume a 
sprightly manner and lightly triil 
“Oh well, I might have flunked 
outright, you know,” but fortunate­
ly for the general peace of mind, 
they -go the way of Cousin Lora 
and her Gimby. family, and become 
social pariahs.. Statistics have 
proven that these little sunbeams 
are but a mote in the eye, one to

Drama Department Featured In
Pathe News Sound Reel
In an educational institution such 
as Carnegie that is devoted to both 
science and art, it is most fitting that 
science should come to the aid of 
art and art to the aid of science; 
in a word it is fitting that choy 
should be- able to complement eich 
other. This meeting on a mutual 
basis has often been accomplished 
and was effected again during the 
past week when the Pathe News 
company visited the drama depart­
ment and recorded a sound pictui-c 
of the prologue to Stephen Phillip’s 
“Ulysses” which is now being pro­
duced by ’ the deaprtmcnt u.i.der the 
direction of Chester Wallace.
Some time ago when the Pathe 
company made their arrangements to 
take a sound news reel of Pittsburgh, 
one which would includc all note­
worthy and characteristic projects of 
the city, they were told by local 
newspaper men that no such film 
would be compilete without a few 
shots of Carnegie and particularly 
of the drama department. In Inis 
work the film company received the
s‘ iccre co-operation of the depart­
ment since an effort is always made 
to keep modernity as one of the 
factor.; of their studies.
Before the final plans were :r 
ranged, it was thought that the pic­
ture would liaVc to be taken out of 
doors, but later when the cine­
matographers came with their record­
ing equipment, the lighting facilities 
and acoustics of the Littl6 Theater 
were found to be well adapted for 
an interior recording. In this way 
the talkie will be able to maintain 
very nearly the same effect as that 
produced when the original scene ;s 
seen and heard.
Prof. Chester M. Wallace, head 
of the drama department, in speaking 
of this rcccnt undertaking of his 
students said, “We were cspccially 
interested bccausc all teachers of 
acting are giving much consideration 
to the sound pictures.”. He also said 
that the talkie work may prove, to 
a certain extent, beneficial to the 
student of drama in that it will

Richard Anderson 
Appointed Editor Of 1930 Thistle
The women of Carnegie arc 
greatly in favor of electing a 
Campus Queen for the Spring Car-, 
nival, according to a report of Mr. 
Aslnvell, chairman of the’proposed 
event submitted to Student Coun­
cil at'its meeting on February 25. 
Mr. Aslnvell stated that as a re­
sult of a vote taken among the 
women students, the coronation of 
the Queen will be included in the 
prpgram which was completed 
yesterday.
A report was also given by Mr. 
-Aslnvell about the mc.i- recom­
mended to fill Mr. Zeihcr’s posi­
tion as Editor-in-Chicf of the 
Thistle. Mr. Aslnvell followed his 
report by a recommendation that 
Mr. Anderson be appointed Editor 
of the 1930 Thistle; this recom­
mendation was approved by Coun­
cil. In connection with, this mat­
ter, it was decided by Council to 
leave the division of the Thistle Ed­
itor’s salary between Mr. Zeihcr 
and Mr. Anderson to the Thistle 
staff. If no decision is reached 
by them, the matter may again be 
referred to Council.
At this meeting, two members 
of Council, Mr. Dcvcrcll and Mr. 
Wchrle, who had been declared in­
eligible, were reinstated. Mr.

NOTICE
A scries of informal discus­
sions of the problems of news 
writing have been planned by 
the editors of the Tartan. The 
first session for women reporters 
will be held on Wednesday, 
March 5, at 2:30, in the Tartan 
office, and there will be a ses­
sion for men reporters on Tues­

Fraternities May Discontiue Their Annual Migratory
A complete report on the Inter- 
fraternity Formal was made by Joe 
Ilcrbst, chairman of the committee, 
at the Interfraternity Council meeting 
last .Saturday-..* As a larger crowd 
than was expected attended the Ball 
a few did not get favors. All un­
redeemed favor, stubs should be in 
the hands of Bud Murray by Wed­
nesday so that the correct'number of 
extra favors can be ordered and 
obtained as soon as possible.
All. of the. fraternities were re­
quested to turn. in. a copy of their 
i^cal at the-“Y” office.; To complcle 
the redccoration of the "Y” club 
room plaques of the fraternities’ 
seals will be placed on the walls.
The matter of dropping the Fra­
ternity Migratory Dance from the 
Spring Carnival program was dis­
cussed by the Council. There arc 
several undesirable . features of the 
Migratory which have been apparent 
in the past.. For one, the cowd 
usually concentrates .in the Forbes 
street Fraternities leaving most of 
the outlying with a rather meager at­
tendance. There has always been the 
problem of trying to exclude out­
siders but no solution has ever been 
found., Finally, the success of the 
Migratory necessarily hinges on the 
weather which can not be depended 
upon.
The Migratory has always beer.

AERO. ENGINEERS VISIT 
WHEELING MARCH 22
A scries of inspection trips to 
places of national importance in 
the aviatiop business world have 
been scheduled by' the Aeronautical 
Engineering Department for the 
next two month's.
The first trip scheduled is a visit 
to the Fokkcr Aircraft Company at 
Wheeling, W. Va., on Saturday, 
March 22. Inasmuch as the 
curriculum of the aeronautic stu­
dents calls for' such trips all the 
sophomores in ,this course will be 
required to make the Wheeling 
trip. The personnel of the trip is 
not limited and all others interested 
are welcome. Those making the 
trip will be excused from a three- 
hour lab in machine design the 
following Tuesday.
Present arrangements are to leave 
the campus by bus early Saturday 
morning and spend the forenoon at 
the Fokker plant. Tickets are on 
sale now, and may be obtained for 
$2.50 from members of the Avia­
tion Club.
A sccond and exceedingly inter­
esting trip has been arranged to 
the Goodyear Zeppelin plant at 
Akron, O., for April 12. This trip 
is required of the juniors in aero­
nautical engineering but is also 
open to any qthcrs interested. Leav­
ing Saturday morning by bus the 
students will, spend the day at 
the Zeppelin plant and perhaps 
make a visit to the University of 
Akron where considerable work is 
being done in aeronautical re­
search.
Buffalo, the home of the Curtiss 
Aircraft Company, the Consolidated 
Aircraft and several other similar 
companies, is under consideration 
as a possibility for .a third trip this 
spring. If sufficient number of stu­
dents manifest their interest in 
the project a trip will be arranged 
whereby the group would leave 
Friday afternoon and spend all day 
Saturday in Buffalo, returning to 
Pittsburgh late that night. -Those

“AFTER ALL” WILL 
BE NEXT PLAY OF 
DRAMA STUDENTS
Comedy By John Van 
Druten to Be Presented 
on March 1 0
¡Mr. Browne Is Director
Carnegie Production i 
Showing of Play in 
America
First
A modern comedy, "After All,” 
by the English playwright, John Van 
Druten, will open in the Little 
Theater, under the direction of 
E. Martin, Browne, on Monday eve­ning, March 10.
“After All” was played in Lon­
don last year and is being revived 
again this year in that city, but 
the Carnegie production will mark 
its first appearance in this country. 
John Van Druten will be remem­
bered as the author of “Young 
Woodley," a play of English public 
school life, that was shown here 
several years ago, and in which 
Glenn Hunter was starred. . Van 
Drutcri’s ncwr play that is being 
pr scnted by the drama department 
is a comedy based on English 
middle-class family life. It is a 
profound observation of this phase 
of English society and is marked 
throughout by intense realism.
Tre play is in six scenes.and its 
action has a duration of six years. 
During this time the young people, 
who at the beginning of the play 
present to their parents the usual 
problems of a younger generation, 
arc married and find, after six 
years, that their children will offer 
the same problems to them.
The cast is as follows: Mr.

SENIORS BEGIN 
PLANS FOR BALL
Re-exams Scheduled to 
Begin on Sat., March 8
The schedule of rc-examina- 
tions for the removal'of First 
Semester deficiencies has been 
announced.
Only, those with an “F" grade 
in a course may take the rc- 
cxam. If the rc-cxam is not 
passed, the grade issued will be 
an “R," and the course must be 
repeated. If one with an "F" 
docs not desire to take the rc- 
cxam at this time, he will have 
another chance in September. 
After September, an "F” from 
the first semester of the pre­
ceding year, 1 automatically be­
comes an “R."
In the Collcgc of Fine Art? 
the rc-cxams come on March 8,
10, 11, 12, 13 and 29, and April 
5. In the other three colleges 
the rc-cxams arc only scheduled 
for Saturdays, beginning Mar. 8.
ri'hc committee- for this year’s 
combined Senior Ball has been ap­
pointed by the senior class presi­
dents of the four schools and ap­
proved by the Student Council. 
The committee is composed of1 one 
•senior, from each school. Vernon 
Becker, a senior of Industries, is 
the chairman of the committee and 
also has charge of the favors and 
programs. Dorothy Bowser, of 
Margaret Morrison, will choose the 
location and arrange for the din­
ner. Henry Bunker, a senior in 
the Collcgc of Engineering, will se­
cure Hie orchestra. Kenneth Owens, 
of the Music Department, is the 
representative from Arts School.
Plans for this year’s ball arc, as 
yet, only tentative. There has been 
some discussion of the Pittsburgh 
Country Club as a possible loca­tion.
Last year’s ball was held at the 
Pittsburgh Country Club with Art 
Gile’s orchestra furnishing the music. 
One of the new features last'year 
was the choicc in men's dress of 
either the regulation formal “tux” 
or the more comfortable white flan­
nels and blue coats. The girls, of 
course, held to the formal evening gowns.
Another novel idea of last year’s 
ball was the attendance of under­
class officers who were permitted 
to come under the same condition 
as seniors.
Prominent Men In 
Business Lecture 
To Printing Dept.
Coming Lectures Scheduled 
By the Department 
Are Interesting
The printing department has 
been very successful this year in 
bringing business men, prominent 
in tlie field of printing and adver­
tising, to Carnegie Tcch. Last 
Tuesday Mr. Homer E. Sterling’s 
classes in Layout and Design 
heard two well-delivered lectures 
by Mr. Edmond H. Sle\Vart on 
“Buying Advertising Typography'’ 
and Mr. A. C. Sutphin on "Water 
Color Inks.”
Mr. Sutphin showed many speci­
mens of , beautiful water color 
printings and explained as he show­
ed each piece the possibilities of 
water color printing. According 
to Mr. Sutphin, there arc six ad­
vantages of water-color printing 
namely, brilliancy of .CQlor, dull 
flat colors, relief from slip sheet­
ing, instant-drying, lack of crystal­
lization, and extreme opacity.
Mr. Stewart spoke on the prob­
lems of advertising production. It 
was especially interesting, because 
he touched on many problems ¡of 
advertising production that. ,will, 
confront each senior wiicu lie goes 
out into, the business, world. II9

most popular features of last year’s 
program.
Sunday evening, March 16, the 
band will pilay at the Emery Metho­
dist Episcopal Church in East Lib­
erty. They will be entertained with 
a dinner before the services.
The trip to East Liverpool, O., 
which the band and Glee Club was 
to make on March 7, has been 
postponed bccausc of their inabil­
ity to use the auditorium on that 
date.
Ändrey Avinoff Advocates
Continued Tradition in Art
Although would-be modernists 
in pictorial art continue to inflict 
their own erratic, illusive, and often 
beautiful "individualities,’’ — and 
nothing else—,‘upon their defence­
less public, one artist remains who 
supports tradition, that tradition 
that means comprehension; — an 
aitist who speaks his language not 
only with sincerity, but with under­
standable precision. That artist is 
Audrey Avinoff, Director of the 
Carnegie Museum, who is exhibit­
ing a collection of some of his 
works in the Hewlett exhibition 
hall of the Arts building, this week 
and through March 20.
Mr. Avinoff disowns the posses­
ion of any personal style;—be­
lieving that the artist should 
render his theme as docs the musi­
cian, who though he may allow his 
personality to influence his music, 
still subordinates it lo the neces­
sity of co-ordinating his theme and 
his style. “A light waltz written
with the grandiloquence ofe Bee­
thoven would be incomprehensible.” 
Mr. Avinoff remarked. In like 
manner the artist should not in­
sist on such a personal style as 
v/ould subtract harmony from the 
whole creation. "If the. subject be 
Persian, the style should be Per­
sian, if archaic the style should be 
aichaic," The Persian St. Francis, 
in the exhibition, is an example of 
this - relation of the style and the 
subject.
Mr, Avinoff also believes that 
pictorial art should not try to tell 
a story. "Pictorial art exists in 
rpace while a story is dependent 
on time. Pictorial art has a cer­
tain stability, a sense of being with 
no lefcrence tp time, while a story 
must necessarily be a series of 
events—impossible to present in a 
sing’c* painting.”
Much of the interest of the ex­
hibition lies in the various cycles

The committcc submitted a bal­
lot to Margaret Morrison to de­
termine the advisability of liavinc;

cent were in favor of having a 
queen. This overwhelming majori­
ty made il unnecessary to conduct2 
similar ballots in the other schools. 
This year the campus queen will

her attendants at her side. The 
campus qticcn will rule the festival- 
at all times and constant honor1» 
will be shown her.

CARNEGIE SOCIAL LIONS
(Continued from Page One) 
cast out with all possible haste
.......liort, their demise is timely,
terrible, and certain, occurring at< 
nil early age I) But for the lament­
ing pessimists—or should tve dub 
them ‘'realists?"-—Life has assumed 
a more traffic aspect, the future 
looks ominous, and fond friends 
and relations have difficulty in re­
straining them from diving to the 
fishes in the Allegheny or the lily 
pond. However they soon realize 
that, such unseemly behavior docs 
not better their unevlable status 
in the least, and set about to rec­
tify the matter in the intervening 
days between the Failure and the 
Comeback. Too little importance 
has been placed on the fact that 
one can never crawl up as easily 
as he slides down, nor. as com­
fortably, but before many moons 
have waned the truth becomes 
painfully evident.
Hard-earned shekels, ostensibly 
hoarded to defray the expenses of 
Prom night, go the way of martyr­
dom to pay one’s tutor. Perhaps 
lie is, ' ironically eijough, the boy 
who did not make your fraternity
because of his neglect of social 
events; lie may be a calumnious 
enemy of yours, or a friend—but 
any case it will be found that 
the business of tutoring is not so 
desirable as to be undertaken for 
pleasure, nor will the thoughts of 
friendship often aid in lessening 
the cost of a month’s tutoring. All 
fine thoughts of sentiment, along 
th the “tie what binds" have 
been strangely lost, stolen, or have 
strayed from the wayside, and one 
must pay, and pay—and PAY I It 
then that the advocate of the 
devil-may-care philosophy, "Take 
no thought for the morrow" must 
needs seek another guiding star, 
for if they practice what they 
preach they will be in dire need of 
some rcstorativel 
Never having experienced the 
awful throes and intricacies of a 
re-exam, we are not capable of 
presenting a truly accurate con­
ception of th'c preceding woe, the 
nightly cramming which detracts 
from valuable time, the attending 
emotions—so often verging on th' 
profane, or the sensations after the 
Ordeal has been completed and the 
gauntlet successfully run. But we 
arc all familiar with the aftermath 
of a particularly dreaded exam— 
with that sensation of Ict-down- 
ncss, usually accompanicd by in­
tense weariness and a fervent—al­
beit a somewhat unholy—desire to
"chuck the whole ------* place I1
The Hut is now, more than ever, 
a scene of unwonted activity, with 
palely studious brows bent in aw­
ful concentration over an assign­
ment of last October; toot the 
bull-scssion, the radio, and the old- 
liiaid game have been abandoned 
in the fervent pursuit of knowl­
edge, and of late the campus has 
achieved" a painful look of self- 
rcpression. Quixotically enough, 
the local fish markets have report­
ed a startling increase in their 
daily, sales since February, for 
their slogan of "Eat Our Fish For 
Brainfood" has proved almost as 
popular as the guaranteed six- 
weeks correspondence course. Re­
port has .it that, sardines arc re­
garded as being particularly bene 
ficial, with salmon running a close 
second, while dried cod, herring 
and shrimp are ncck-and-ncck in 
achieving 'the distinction of third 
placc; -ficoreS/, of minor varieties 
being close on the heels—pardon 
us, on the "fins I"—of the popular 
fish. The memory,-i mproving 
courser, are also attracting popular 
favor, although the benefit of a 
course which first advocates 
complete knowledge of those sec­
tions of the telephone directory 
containing the redundant Smiths 
and Cohens, is extremely doubtful 
in our minds ....
We conclude that “collitch" is 
making the right step when it has 
exams and re-exams. (.Our identity 
is kept secret, lest we should be 
foully done away with on the mug­
giest of foggy nights I) It is val­
uable, for when Carl Campus fin­
ishes his intensive cramming, a 
faint gleam of intelligence has 
doubtless penetrated the darkness, 
and lie begins to "know what it's 
all about." Knowledge so gained 
is useful if only for purposes' of 
inexorable self-discipline and en­
lightenment. But, to cease moral­
izing .... Go in the exam room 
with the consciousness that here is 
your opportunity of redemption; 
that you can meet the prof on 
equal grounds and give him a stiff 
uppercut, or even straight-arm 
him (figuratively, of course!), and, 
best of all, you may ‘'"show off 
with pcrfcct taste," and defeat his 
avowed intentions of flunking you.

Saturday, March’ I, the Tartans 
Glided their basketball s** .son by los­
ing to Geneva 39-30. In spite of the 
fact that the visitors held a nine 
point lead when the final whistle 
blew the game proved to be most 
exciting and was very close thrpugh-

Nease was high point man for the 
home team and also was very in­
fluential in checking many of the 
rallies attempted 1/ the Beaver Falls 
men;
In the first, period the lead zig­
zagged back and forth and honors 
were about evenly distributed. Early 
the second half Nease took a 
pa-s from Leonard and caged a 
pretty field goal to tie the count 16- 
16. Montgomery again put Geneva 
in the lead by drpping in another 
two-pointer from a little beyond the 
foul line. But the Tartans made 
it even oncc more when Weiss, who 
had been substituted fo- Webster, 
looped another field goal and Merten 
added another point from the foul 
line. The Beaverites then started a 
surprising offense and before the 
Skibos could solye their method of 
attack they held a lead of six points 
Again Carnegie retaliated with a 
rally which fell only one point short 
of again tying the score. The visitors 
then made four field goals and a 
couple of fouls while all the Scotch-

Typing by wire—an adventure 
in communication
The telephone typewriter, a new Bell 
System service, has commercial possi­
bilities as yet barely realized.
For example,a business house can type­
write a message over telephone wires, 
and this is retyped instantaneously and 
simultaneously in any number of branch 
offices. The advantage is obvious — in
knitting together far-flung organizations 
and in quickening the pace of business.
Here is still another extension of 
telephone sendee which has already- 
proved its value. The telephone type­
writer promises even greater things a5

SECRETARYWhy Winter Humidiiy 
Is Penetrating
Have, you ever stopped, to think 
why it is that we feel tho cold as 
much as we do in the winter time? 
Possibly it is foremost in your 
thoughts as you walk up the cut 
or. over the bridge in the park.. An 
.explanation of this condition is 
given here in the hope that your 
worries on this particular subject 
may be dissolved and you can de­
vote all your thoughts to your 
studies.
In summer, humidity .makes us 
uncomfortable with its oppressive 
heat, but in winter it chills us ’ to 
the bone. Few of us ever stop to 
think why this is so. The oppres­
siveness of summer humidity, be­
cause of its checking of evapora­
tion from our skin, is generally 
known, but the penetrating effects 
of moisture in winter is not .so 
well understood.
One cause of this chill may be 
due to the fact that our warm skin, 
directly exposed or partially sub­
jected by thin clothing to the hu­
mid atmosphere outdoors, evaportes 
quickly the moisture condensed 
upon it. The heat radiated from 
cur bodies induces this evaporation, 
and the drying moisture upon our 
skin chills us.
Another contribution to this may 
be that our clothing absorbs mois­
ture readily, and as moisture laden 
materials conduct heat more rapidly 
our clothes draw the heat quickly 
from our bodies. This makes us 
feel cold. Aii illustration of this 
is that a damp cloth used to hold 
a hot cooking utensil is more likely 
to burn than a dry one,because the 
damp cloth will conduct the heat 
more rapidly to your hand from 
the source of heat. This will also 
illustrate the chief cause for the 
sudden loss of bodily heat, because 
cold moist air will take heat much 
more rapidly from our bodies than 
extremely cold dry air, for the 
reason that moisture is a conduc­
tor of heat, while dry atmosphere 
is an insulator. Electricity is con­
ducted and insulated by the same 
elements.
Perhaps some other condition 
hastens atftl intensifies the chill we 
experience upon leaving a warm 
dry indoor atmosphere into humid 
outdoor air. Is it that the .sudden 
.inhaling of cold moist air into the 
lungs may have some effect upon 
our nerves, making us feel cold 
all over? Perhaps physicians might 
be able to enlighten us if such 
oxidation taking place in our lungs 
would make us feel cold by son\e 
connection with the nervous sys-‘ 
tern. Also mcteorlogists would like 
to know more about the amount of 
relative humidity just suited for 
the lungs in a normal person to 
produce the most healthful results. 
A temperature of 65 and a relative 
humidity of about 50% is not ojily 
quite comfortable but heathfuj, 
while a temperature of '75 or HO

DIDJA NOTICE
“The Woman of Andros” (A. & 
C. Boni) is by. Thornton Wilder: 
Let me tell you something, if you 
want something sadly beautiful, some­
thing romantic to a degree, some­
thing polished to perfection, and 
something to lift you out of your 
mental rut, read "A Woman of 
Andros." Thornton Wilder has never 
written >cttcr. Heartily recommcm'-xl
“Jews Without Money” (Liveright) 
is by Michael Gold. This story ot 
the East Side ha: all the tang of the 
tenements. Baby, don’t let the flatness 
of that sentence keep you awav from 
it. It’s an autobiography of a boy 
who learned about life from the tene­
ments. What he found out goes in 
to make the book, and, what a book! 
Recommended without reserve.
"Shadows of Men" (D. Doran) is 
by Jim Tully. A bunch of down- 
atid-outcrs tell their stqry in their 
own inimitable way. Why tell you 
to read a Tullv book? You’ve prob­
ably read it anyway. If not, what’s 
the matter?
"Voodoo" (Crime Club) is by John 
Estevcn. No better, no worse than 
most.
"Omnibus of Crime” (Brewer and 
Warren) by Dorothy Sayers is all 
that its name implies. Why not this 
instead of mystery stories?
By the way, if you want to play 
a dirty trick on someone, give them 
a copy of "Boy Scout Jamboree" 
(Free Adv.)E.DEL.
Didja Notice that the thinganiajiq: 
you push down on, on the founta:n 
on the first floor arts is marked 
"II." Seems to me, that it ought to 
be up on the fourth boor where it 
\ ill be quite true.
Didja Notice that the last Night 
Student Council dance was also a big success?
Didja Notice the swell type, on the 
Book Review column?
Didja Notice that a- powerful or­
ganization has sprung up called the 
Pelican Club? Heh, I-Ieh!
Didja Notice the write-up the Kil­
tie baud got in the Duqucsnc 'Duke?
Didja Notice who is back.in town? 
No, Mr. Vance not Teddy Joyce.
Didja Notice that there are still 
some people who lift their eyebrows at girls’ smoking?
Didja Notice that Spring was hero 
for a while?
Didja Notice that new Gyp joint in town ?
Didja Notice' that traveling sales­
man jokes aren’t whispered any move 
Which reminds me—.
The Night Student Council has 
added more laurels to its record 
of successful social achievements. 
The latest 'affair was the Wash­
ington’s Birthday Dance, commem­
orating the natal day of the “Fath 
er of Our Country."
The auditorium of the men’s 
gymnasium was bedecked in a riot 
of color through the medium of 
countless balloons. There were 
also nine large novel lanterns 
strung across the hall decoratcd in 
silhouette depicting colonial figures, 
a fitting complement to the occa­
sion.
It would be hard to find a bet­
ter drilled group anywhere than 
that which portrayed the Minuette: 
It didn’t require much imagination 
to take one back to the Colonial 
Days with all its splendor and 
color with such charming costumes 
and graceful dancers. And the mu­
sicians, too, they were not to be 
outdone either. They were part 
and parcel of the ensemble, making 
all in all, a complete picture of 
the day and times.The major dance music was fur­
nished by E. J. Bocchicchio and 
his Venetian Serenadcrs, and while 
this was their first appearance on 
the Tech Campus, we hope some 
day to have another opportunity 
of dancing to their music.
Mr. and Mrs. Young, Mr. and 
Mrs. Trimmer, Mr. and Mrs. Sim- 
boli, Mr. and Mrs. Blackball and 
Mr. and ,Mrs. Dibble were the 
guests of 4jic evening and afford­
ed much pleasure by their pres­
ence.About as unique a souvenir pro­
gram as I have ever sepn was used 
for the dance tallies ¦ and showed 
a great deal of thought and work 
on the part of the author. .
Favors and refreshments were in 
order also, in bounteous propor­
tions, and added considerably to 
the success of the affair.
When you stop to Consider what 
has been done by this group of 
night students you arc forccd to 
wonder how it is possible, taking 
into consideration the small amothit 
of time they must have to work 
up these affairs.
Hope it is one that will give us at 
least a half a chance in crossing.
I noticed in. a recent article that 
an association of Engineers had 
dis« overed at last that there is a 
great deal of fake "mail order, 
-houses” in the correspondence 
school. I have often seen adver­
tising data teljing you that in-two 
weeks or something like that you 
could become a full fledged en­
gineer in electricity, mechanics or 
what not by simply writing to this 
or' that address and permitting 
them to send you, gratis, all the 
"dope." It must be easy, or there 
must %be a lot of "easy marks” in 
this profession to have the large 
number of ’ prospective “engineers” 
apply for the dope'and get stung.- 
This is something I have Ticver 
fallen for, -although I should be­
cause it certainly would be an easy 
way-’ to get . a degree, and who 
want's a degree anyhow.
The W a s h i n g t o n’s Birthday 
Dance held by the Night Student 
Council on . February 22 was a 
glowing success from every stand­
point.
Co-operation was the keyword 
otherwise it would not have been 
possible in -»such a short space of 
time to transform . the cold, drab 
Gymnasium auditorium into the 
gayly bedecked Ball Room that it 
was. It is hard to know where to 
start to commend those workers 
on this affair who gave of their 
time' so generously.
The members of the tableaux 
group arc a credit to any organi­
zation. To produce such a well 
acted sketch meant a lot of energy 
and time spent beforehand in pre­
paration. Those compising the 
Minuette group in the dancing role 
were Emma Koch, Muriel Zimmer­
man, Helen Schoeller, Martha Jones, 
Henry Mauro, Jack Judge, James 
Morphy* and William Yandall. The 
incidental chamber music was fur­
nished by the well balanced trio 
which included Mary Redmond, Hula 
Loefridgc • and # William Roberts. 
The Drama Department also aided 
immensely by s u p p 1 y-i n g the 
"Props.” Nor was this all; they 
set up. the scene for us without 
which the. tableaux would not have 
been so successful or colorful. It 
is to Mr. Mulholland and his two 
co-workers qf the Day group, that 
a lot of credit and thanks arc dtie.
The unique lanterns • strung 
across the ' Gymnasium were hand 
decorated by "Buz” Fitzgerald, as­
sisted. by Emma Mauro and Bill 
Wentz. They were ably done and 
were the occasion of much favorable- 
comment.
The lighting arrangements were 
under the. direction of Frank Golitz 
and William Gcmmcll and entailed 
considerable work before the en­
semble was' completed.
1 ast but not at all the least inir 
portant work was that done by all 
those boys who turned out in ‘the 
afternoon and evening to lend1 a 
hani. hetc and there where it was 
needed to make everything in read­
iness for the affair. For without 
this stalwart body of workers it 
would not be possible to conduct 
the affair in such a successful 
manner.
.it is ccrtainly a manifestation .of 
co-operation* on all sides when • so 
successful an affair can be put o'yqr 
and everyone who had a part in 
it ccrtainly deserves much credit 
and thanks for their efforts from 
the student body whom they arc try­
ing to serve..
•Did you- ever see it rain before 
a> hard as it did-'last Monday, es­
pecially' at 10:30 or thereabouts? 
It reminded me of Noah and his Ark 
and the Deluge. You ask how 1 
know. Well, can’t I surmise a little 
too, everybody is doing it, so why 
can’t I. Everything seemed to be. 
.tied up,, street cars, machines, and 
_'cyei;ything.; Y'ou just couldn’t get 
through. That shelter pavilion' ccr­
tainly came in handy, and it was 
well used that evening. It was 
very., thoughtful of the powers that 
be to build such a convenience at 
tlixs point. Wonder how they came 
to erect such a shelter. At ail 
events we are glad it is here. 
During the coursc of the week I 
heard oi a student living on the 
North Side who did not get to his 
destination until well after one a. m. 
His class was dismissed at 10:30 
and he spent the balance of the 
time making various street; car 
rides'. First on Forbes street, then 
Fifth avenue. It seemed at Soho 
the whole hillside came -down, and 
this necessitated a long delay. 
Here’s hoping we don’t have an­
other rain storm like the last. one.
• Well I attended the Washington's 
vBirthday Dance; and how. Just 
can't say enough about , the good 
time I had, and the girl too. Don't 
know when 1 enjoyed a dance as 
much before. There were a number 
of improvements, which all-goes to 
show that we live and learn. The 
.-previous.' two dances held in the 
Gym caused a lot of work on my part 
.cleaning off the corn meal from 
-the "girl friend’s” suade boots, I 
should say slippers. This.'time- ho 
sUCh manual labor, for they had 
wax, real honest .to goodness wax,- 
and it sure did make a difference, 
;The; floor was so smooth that all 
you had to do was to shuffle your 
iect a little and you glided along 
without the slightest effort. Th(T 
orchestra too was about as good 
ar. outfit as I have ever danced too 
and. this is saying a good deal.
1 ofticn wonder who docs the art 
wcrk' for the programs, as they are 
ceitainly about the clcvcrest sketch­
es -you -have ever seen. The last 
one Avas well done, both in design 
and style. If I had a- commercial 
art shop, I wqiild engage the ones 
responsible, for these to do my 
;Work.
Noticcd in last week’s Plaid that 
they published parking regulations 
for night students on the Campus. 
Well—laugh that one off. \Vho 
wants to ride a machine when you 
see so much propaganda urging 
'you to use the street cars. You 
won’t be bothered, about parking, 
but you will; be bothered and con- 
c-:ned too, as to when you will 
arrive at you destination. Between
the both problems what are you
gcing to do especially if your
machine is :out of commission, or 
if you don’t own one, -suppose the 
next best thing to do is ride the 
street cars. However, let those 
who do drive cars observe the 
rules, and make it safe for those 
who dpn’t.
Speaking! pf. safe, and safety, my 
thoughts turn--to that Traffic Light 
¦v. e were told we were going to
have erected at Forbes and More- 
wood avenue; You certainly are 
risking aH you have to- try to cross 
spmeiimcs. If they don't . hurry up 
and put it. up the term will be 
over, and we.won’t have the good 
of it this year. . I wonder what 
kind of a light will be installed.
It is the Plaid’s pleasure this week 
to . present Henry E. M. Mauro. tiie 
Secretary of the 'light Student Coun­
cil.
Mr. Mauro has spent several years 
on flic campus, and is registered in 
the College <3f Fine Arts, in the De­
partment of Painting and Decorating
lti addition to his work as S.»';rr- 
tary he finds time to make all the 
sketches and drawings used on the 
various programs by the night groups 
These arc designed and executed 
with a" skill that only a real artist 
possesses. He also is a loyal sup­
porter of school activities, and man­
ages to find time to promote school 
spirit, and this too, without sacrific­
ing any of his class attendance.
Mr. Mauro has been appointed the 
Night-Editor of the 1930 Thistle, rhe 
College Year Book, and we know 
lie will product! a section represent­
ing our group which we can bn 
justly ’proud of.
degrees and humidity of only 25% 
is too dry and unhealthful. The 
latter condition exists in a good 
many homes, evaporation being so 
rapid that people’s bodies do not 
feel the heat.
In order to comply with a con­
dition of a will which bequeathed 
$5,000,000 to the .University of Ver­
mont, ¦ the enrollment has been 
restricted to 1,000 students, all of 
whom must be residents of Ver­mont,
Congratulations To 
The “Trojan Owl
The "Plaid” has just received the 
current issue of the "Trojan Owl” 
that paper of the University of 
Southern California which serves 
same purpose as the "Plaid” at Car- 
r.'gie. The "Owl” is edited and pub­
lished by the Night Students and 
contains all the news 'f interest .for 
students of that school.
This is the "Owl's” first birthday 
and its snappy ci .ninelit foru a one 
year old-leads us to believe that it 
is quite popular among its sup­
porters out on the coast.
The "Plaid’ staff takes this op­
portunity to congratulate the "Owl” 
upon its accomplishments and wishes 
it a long life and the enthusastic 
support of its student body.
Professor J. Willard Ilcrshey of 
McPherson College, Kansas, has 
made a diamond from sugar and 
irpn fillings by exerting a pressure 
of ton tons to the square inch on 
pure table sugar. This pressure 
was developed by heating the sugar 
to a temperature of 5000 degrees 
fahrehheit, and then dropping 'the 
ihass into art ice cold brine. The 
foreign matter was then dissolved, 
leaving pure carbon in the form 
of a diamond.

Famous Editor Speaks 
To Printers At Dinner Of Pi Alpha Delta
On .February 17, forty-five mem­
bers of the Printing Department 
attended a dinner and lecture held 
at . the Carnegie Library Cafeteria. 
The speaker of llie evening was
• Mr. Henry llillman, editor-in-chief 
of the inland Printer from 1917 
until 1928 and present editor of the 
J'ypotlictae Bulletin. The program 
was in charge of the Pi Alpha 
Delta, the printing honorary fra­
ternity, with William McFarl
• acting as chairman.After the dinner the guests were 
entertained by a faculty quartette 
composed of Professors T. D. Myl- 
rca, A. H. Blaisdcl, David Gustaf­
son, and B. C. Dennison. Mr. 
Hillman then talked of the de­
velopments of printing up to the 
present time, dealing with great 
men in the early printing field and 
the progress made in typography 
and typesetting machines. Mr. 
Hillman illustrated his lecture with 
interesting lantern slides and show­
ed his audience some original man­
uscripts from famous printers. Af­
ter the lecture, Mr. Hillman ex­
plained these manuscripts to, the 
studenLs who ‘ ' *
them closely.

Intelligence is about the last 
thing a Princeton Freshman likes 
to find in a girl, if any generaliza 
tion can be drawn from a vote re­
cently taken among the 490 Fresh-1 
men there. The vote also indicated 
that, <5f the mass mind, constancy 
was a’ rather trivial consideration. 
Seventy-four decided that the most 
essential quality of the ideal girl 
is physical beauty; 65 voted per­
sonality; ability to dance well ap- 
pcallcd to *15, and good sense and 
humor to 3*1. Sixteen came to the 
conclusion that the most essential 
quality of the ideal girl is ab­
stinence from drinking,* while nine 
desired abstinence from both smok­
ing and dVinking,
This report, while very trivial in 
itself, might be used to advantage 
in determining the cffects of college 
education on social ideals if com­
pared to a survey made of these 
same ^students when and if they 
become seniors.' May we suggest 
to "The State", that such a survey 
be made?* * *
A committee of the J ntcrfratcrnity 
Council sit' Michigan ‘State College 
has drawn up a new set; of - initia­
tion rules which virtually outlaws 
hell-week. Outstanding among the 
new rules arc these: No student 
may be initiated who has not had 
at least a "C" average up to the 
time of his initiation. All initia­

Last week the Heating and Ven- 
tilating Department received a 
Gottld pneumatic water supply sys­
tem and a Pctro oil burner for use 
in its testing laboratory. The oil 
burner, which is a gift of the 
Pctro Heat and Power Company
of Stamford, Connecticut, consists 
of a motor driven oil pump and 
spraying device. The pneumatic
water supply system which was 
donated by the . Gould Pump Com­
pany of Scncca Falls, New York, 
is the thir.d one of these outfits 
sent to the Heating and Ventilat­
ing Department. From the three
systems now in the • laboratory it 
is interesting to trace the develop­
ment in Avatcr supply pumping
systems. , The first Gould pump 
which is about six years old need­
ed a 250 gallon lank to work suc­
cessfully. 'i’lic next step was to 
reduce the' size of the tank until 
it^ needed a capacity of approxi­
mately 25 gallons. Now the latest 
development is the same pump 
operating with a tank of no more 
than one or two gallons.

Plebes Overwhelm 
Geneva Reserves 
In Season’s Final
COMES AN ECHO from the first major sport of the year 
and ends the period of suspense. We salute Captain John E. 
Dreshar, selected by his coaches to guide the 1930 football 
eleven. On last Saturday afternoon, his selection by his mentors 
as. active captain and by his teammates as honorary captain, was 
first 'made known. To John go the best wishes of his fellow 
students.
Thrice captain of Carnegie football teams—oncc in his 
Freshman year, then in his second year of Varsity play and now 
in his third—John’s name stands out boldly in the annals of 
Carnegie’s sports. A hard-hitting, aggressive lineman, he has 
established himself in the front ranks of the stars of modern 
football. The confidence of his coaches and fellow players in 
his ability as a leader is reflected in his re-selection as captain 
May his coming reign be an eventful one—full of triumph and 
glory.* * * *
AS THE FIRST COMES BACK onto the stage for £ 
brief spell, the second major sport makes its exit. On last Sat­
urday evening, with the Geneva game, the Skibo basketeers 
bade farewell to the 1929-30 season. Earlier in the week they 
had met again their city rivals, the Panthers of Pitt. Neither 
game was; won1 by our boys, but each opposing team went home 
conscious of a victory hard won. It was not an impressive end­
ing for a rather unimpressive season, but it marked the com­
pletion of the most successful schedule in years. Perhaps the 
victory side of the column is .rather barren, but there-are hopes 
for next season. . Basketball was shown to be on the up-grade. 
A great many of the defeats might just as easily have been vic­
tories—many of tlie scores were close. • The team looks better
than it has in former years. A new system of play, under a
new coach, is not developed to its fullest power in one season. 
No team ascends from a mediocre one to a good one in three 
short months. Next year we should, and will, have a better 
team. To Coach Ralph Hogan goes our praise for the work 
•which lie. has done and may his team of 1931 be among the best. * * * *
NOW ENTERS THE THIRD, AND LAST, MAJOR 
SPORT. The call for track candidates came last Wednesday 
and yesterday Coach Guy Halferty began the preliminary train­
ing work. These last few days are misleading, as far as outdoor 
sports go. We jjust can’t seem to picture a figure in a much 
abbreviated costume while we are "homeward wending our 
weary way” through 'those drifts that persist in accumulating 
along that very, very windy thoroughfare known as the Cut. 
Nevertheless, Coach Halferty has started his work. If you hap­
pen to be interested in pounding pathways, hopping hurdles, or 
hurling those queer looking objects that heroes have hurled 
hither and thither since Friend J. Caesar graduated into long 
skirts—report to the coach. And please, if you really must do 
your hurling on the lawns surrounding the Cut, hurl the other 
way when we hustle hurriedly hence.. We know just how things
are. We’ve walked across that worthy parthway during previous
track seasons.* * * *
ALL THE WHILE, THE RIFLEMEN have been firing 
merrily away in the basement of the famed home of the Maggie 
Murphs. Rifle is a sport in which Carnegie excells and, thus far, 
things have been going well: This institution has .been blessed 
.with good material and excellent opportunities for its develop­
ment. The coaching is done by Lieut. Cothran, who knows his 
rifles. The lieutenant also explains to Carnegie’s embryro army 
the mysteries of when and when not to run—he being an in­
structor in ..the. Military Department. We know, we’re taking 
a certain course designated as R-10.
* * * i *
THE TANKERS ARE STILL SPLASHING merrily away 
over in the gym pool. Last Friday they outsplash'ed our friends 
from Washington, Pa., the Presidents of W. & J. The Plaid 
team won first place in every event, to score 48 points to the 
visitor’s 18. The Plebes, too, were victorious, winning 38-28 
over Langley High.
On Saturday, the University of Cincinnati boys swam in 
our pool and marched away with a 44-22 win, while the Plebes 
lost 36-30, to the prepsters from Kiski.
This week the Varsity will journey over to Ohio to swim 
against Western Reserve and Case on Friday and Saturday, re­
spectively. Then no more until the battle with the arch-enemy, 
the Panthers, on March 12. ‘ ;

The Carnegie Plebes wound up 
their floor season Saturday with a 
40-17 victory over the Geneva Re­
serves. The Plaid got off to an 
early lead and the Covenanters 
were hopelessly out of it from the 
slart. The Freshmen worked 
smoothly and at all times were the 
masters of the team which had 
nosed them out by a one point 
margin earlier in the season.
The Plebes opened with a rush 
and found little trouble getting 
away to an early lead with Smith 
and Burns featuring the attack, 
The Freshmen continued to pile 
up points and were leading 11 --4 at 
the^end of the first quarter. During 
the second quarter the Plebes con­
tinued to hold the upper-hai\d and 
the ‘ score at the end of the. half 
was 20-6.
. During the early stages of the 
second, half the Geneva boys came 
back strong and for a few minutes 
early in the game managed to out- 
score the Tartans. Using a de­
layed attack the Plebes held their 
own for the third quarter, tfach 
team scoring seven points during 
this period. During the final ses­
sion of the game the Plebes cut 
loose with all they had and pilled 
up 13 points to their opponents 
four making the final score 40-17 
in favor of the Freshmen.
By scoring 40 points the Plebes 
accomplished- the feat of sinking 
them at the rate of a point a min­
ute for the first time this season. 
How the Geneva team ever 
managed to., score that one point 
victory over the Plebes early in 
the season is a greater mystery 
than ever. Stentz, the Plebfc center 
lead the scoring with four field 
goals and three points from the 
foul line.
By winning Saturday’s game the 
Plebes made their season’s record 
five victories and six defeats. Half 
of the games which they lost how­
ever were by the narrow margin 
of a single point. Three! of the 
defeats were handed them by the 
strong Pitt Freshmen outfit while 
two were, the presents of the Kiski 
five.

LAIRD OF SKIBO
CAPTAIN JOHN E. DRESHAR
By staging a sensational come­
back in the last half the Pitt fresh­
men overcame the Carnegie Plebes 
and protected their long winning 
streak with a 28-18 victory. The 
Plebes. although defeated were in 
the lead throughout the first half 
and it was not until the final min­
utes- of the third quarter that the 
Pitt boys first gained the upper- 
hand.

Aquatic Meet, 44-22
Varsity and Plebe swimmers 
tended to liquidate their claims on 
the fresh water sport in the form; 
of victories over W. \& J. and 
Langley High respectively. Fri­
day’s work was the result of un­
tiring efforts, and both of our 
squads are to be commended for 
their work in this line. The W. 
& J. boys were drowned out with 
a score of 48 to 18, while the 
yearling? came through with a 38 
to 28 win.
Just to make the triumph more 
effective, the , varsity made awav 
with every first place. Which all 
goes to disprove the recently de­
veloped theory "that you can’t 
swim in a pool;room.” Now don’t 
get the idea that all oitr boys arc 
pool sharks, for we like' to think 
of them-:a5 absorbing the wonders 
of the. textbook' or comic page dur­
ing their leisure hdurs.' And «still 
we must add: “what a Hvliale of a 
difference a few sense, make.”
None other than A1 Redding

yard free .style raccs, and ajso 
helped the relay team to its vic­
tory. The' Scots won several races 
with big leads, and ‘were not ex­
tended in doing so. This accounts 
for some of the slow times made. 
The efforts of Sangster, Basler; 
Shafer and Hazelwood were re­
garded with firs^.plap^s jfi., ep,ch..oi

In Fast Contests
On Monday night, the Welch 
II all team came from behind in 
the last half to nose out the 
Sibma Nu team by one point, the 
dormitory boys winning 28-27. The 
Sigma Nil’s got off to a fast start 
and at half time had their oppo­
nents down to a 17-14 score. How­
ever, the Welch Hall team came 
back strong, and in a flashy finish 
nosed out their rivals by one point.
The Beta Sigma Rhos. showed 
excellent offensive power Monday 
night and had little difficulty in 
downing the Lambda Chi outfit 
47-10. The winners were ahead 
24-2 at the end of, the half. Gold­
berg appeared to be the star of the 
game, accumulating seven field 
goals and three fouls for a total 
of 17 points.
Continuing their good playing 
which enabled them to win their 
first game, the Phi Kappas de­
feated the S. P. E.s. The Phi
Kappas gained a 12-6 edge at. half 
time and were never threatened 
thereafter. Connelly of the winners 
appeared to be the best player in 
the contest.
After a lay-off ofNone night, the 
Beta Sigma Rho’s bucked up
against the McGill Hall outfit and 
defeated them 22-12. The McGil' 
Hall outfit,-last year's champions, 
were expected to give the Beta 
Sigma Rho’s a close fight, but they
seemed unable to stop the on­
slaught of their opponents. The 
losers held their rivals to a 10-12 
score at the end of the half, but 
they let down the second period 
and scored only two points. Again 
Goldberg starred, scoring half of 
the winners’ tally.

W. A. A. HIKE
A_ delightful overnight hike has been planned by Imo'gcnc Schorcy for this coming week-end. As this will be the first time for many years that such a hike is to be given, it should meet with a great deal of enthusiasm.
The unfortunate part about the plans is that because of lack of sufficient accommodations everyone cannot go. Imogcne has been forced to limit the group to 25 or 30 women, including Board members.
A poster will be put both on M. M. and Arts bulletin boards on which those who care to liiakc the hike will sign their names. The cost of the hike will be 50 cents to cover the cost of food. Also, each woman will pay for her own transportation, which will be only a small ' amount.
The 20 women who sign up FIRST and who pay their 50 cents- to Imogene, who will arrange to be in M\ M. hall at a certain hour, will be the lucky ones.
The entire group, under the chaperonagc of Miss Porter, will leavf from M. Mr C. C. Saturday afternoon, travel by a street car to a spccial place from which it will hike to the cabin where the night will be spent The hikers will return the following afternoon. The hour and further instructions will be. posted this afternoon. If you arc interested, a-, you all-will be, keep a sharp lookout for that poster and get your name down as soon as possible.<$> <$> <•><•>

This Thing Called Education
Our parents, together with the world in general, tenaciously 
maintain their view that the front parlor of education contains 
too many modern conveniences, too much overstuffed furniture 
and rugs which can be all too conveniently rolled back lor ex­
cessive muscular a.nd social consociation. The affirmation is that 
a better product would be forthcoming if there.was more honest 
work in the kitchen and an additional amouiit of supervised 
labor in the back yard.
They are undoubtedly justified in expressing dissatisfaction 
in the disjointed shell, covered as it is with a flaky, four-year 
veneer, or so-called knowledge, instead of. the entity they were 
led to expect. But the result is not due to a frivolous front 
parlor, but to a commercial kitchen and a specialized back yard. 
With college incom'es topping a third of a billion dollars and 
enrollments upwards to three-quarters of a million, ranging from 
microscopic Shurtleff with ITS students, to mammoth Columbia, 
with its 33,000, education indeed becomes as big á business a's 
any registered on Wall Street. As such it is generously studded 
with the follies and iniquities characteristic of any large scale 
business. What pride they take in'their reputation and gradu­
ates—we guarantee a man with our B. S. degree to háve' passed 
mathematics, mechanics, etc. With conscientious care he will 
deliver anything up to three integral signs or design a bridge 
with the decimal points in the correct places, with no auxiliary 
equipment or replacements necessary. The range of this B. S. 
man in any other field is very limited, but we can furnish com­
parable prototypes on demand. Please consult our catalogue, 
and order by the degrees listed therein. How well this illus­
trates our modern system—loosely called education. If educa­
tors were as energetic in the creation of á love for knowledge, 
a desire for insight, as they are in the search for endowments 
and the fight to keep their respective institutions in the front 
line of the highly competitive educational rigamarole, there 
would be justification for little criticism.
Our modern educational system, constituted as it is, excites 
the student not to learn, but to get passing marks, a large and 
varied enough collection of which equals-one bachelors degree. 
The recipient dabs his eyes, bids fond adieu to a generous Alma 
Mater, and as a labeled “educated” man- expects a niche well up 
on the ladder of success. Such sublime optimism. .? A good 
education is an excellent dowry, but a gradaute often finds his 
dowry falls short of what is expected and consequently'is of 
little market value. Whether Mr. Graduate murders the king’s 
English, has never heard of Galileo or Rudolph Friml, .thinks 
the poor were ordáined by God, and all strikers should be bay­
oneted, remotely associates Darwin with apes and Dórá Russell 
with free love, arouses little consternation among educators. 
Not that these are set criteria whereby to judge an educated 
man, but it exemplifies the shallow and splotchy character 'of 
our system.
In this helter-skelter game of cramming, a student absorbs 
enough facts to pass one course only to hurriedly forget them 
in his haste to learn the essential facts of the next course. All 
with one salient feature in mind, the reward forthcoming in the 
form of a passing grade. Dr. Rogers, the New York educator, 
said, “Colleges worship marks” and that a degree “merely in­
dicates that the student has agreed with his professors for'four 
years.” Students can learn facts and parrot them back to pro­
fessors in recitation and quizzes, but as far as getting, any real 
understanding or appreciation of literature, history, .matehmatics 
or science—it is often just not in them, but more often it is 
just not in the professors or in the system. There are wide dif­
ferences among members of a college faculty;' in their ability to 
lead, coax, decoy or drive their students up the hill of learning. 
A few have a kind of radio-active capacity for emitting Gamma 
as well as Alpha and Beta rays. They can penetrate almost any 
wall of mental or other types of resistance/but a great numbér 
tare little whether students become interested, and care less 
whether they pass. It is never the professors fault,- however, 
and the uninterested student is harshly-accused of “showing the 
wrong attitude.”
But educators insist-they give the maximum amount, in four 
years’ time. If so, why not make the courses of five years’ dura­
tion? After all, one should go to college for a well-rounded 
education, and there is little reason why colleges should con­
tinue to turn out products for .which they must constantly apol­
ogize. And why not give students more choice in their selection 
of subjects constituting a course? Forcing students to take sub­
jects which they dislike or for which they have little interest is 
merely a waste of valuable time, and degenerates into educa­
tional coercion. After all, .the student himself will suffer for 
what he fails to take or be rewarded for his efforts. As it is, 
he steers an erratic course between the Scylla of useless and 
disliked studies, and the Charybdis of ever waiting F’s to grad­
uate into what he is led to believe is á smooth sea-—he invari­
ably finds that sea filled with many triple-headed monsters while 
his handbook deals only with ones of two heads, or that he has 
been trained to understand only one species of the myriad of 
monsters he will encounter. All in all colleges of today ex­
emplify Butler’s Erewhonian Colleges of Unreason, dealing in 
a broad sense as they do with the hypothetical languages.

Two weeks from this coming Fri­
day comes the event for which every 
man has waited since the portals of 
our famed institution were thrown 
open last September. We have refer­
ence to the Woman's Junior Prom. 
The Women’s Junior Prom is a 
rather novel'' event in the: life of 
every man who attends, in that the 
woman pays.. After the recent Men’s 
Junior Prom and the still more 
recent Inter-fraternity flag rush, the 
ev;nt will come as a welcome relief 
to the fatigued pocketbooks of our 
parents and' guardians. Those men 
who have attached ,thcmselvcs~^o the 
one and/ only during the current 
school year are ..ow congratulating 
themselves on their foresight. Those 
who have done a little experimental 
work as regards feminine accom­
plices for the present social season 
are crossing fingers and hoping.
The well known ladies of the 
Junior class who are in chrrgc of 
the annual "gift day” have gone 
about their work with customary 
gusto, judging from the.number |f 
times we have seen their pictures 
plastered all over the various dailies. 
Of course, with Ida Campbell di­
recting publicity, what more can be 
expect. Ida is also in charge of ob­
taining an orchestra for the dance, 
but, so far, she has succeeded in 
keeping its identity a secret. Any­
one knowing Ida can realize what a job she has.
•Nevertheless, despite the above, 
this affair promises to be just as 
good as the Delta Skull Junior 
Prom, and that certainty was worth­
while, so every lady. who has been 
here three years should talk very 
gently to their parental provider, 
then see Miss Schory. She’ll be glad 
to sell you a ticket. And remember,- 
it is no harder to get a man to 
say yes for the Women’s Junior 
Prom than it was for the men to 
get you to say yes for theirs.

one day 'last week—interest ’ hicii 
was riiatcrially augmented' by a de­

amusement caused by overhearing 
some particularly malicious “cat-talk” 
wl.ile in line! And then in one corner 
was an unintelligible mass of pro­

itself into a tousled specimen of

We hear that a tobacco-chewing 
contest recently took place on the 
campus—sans the indubitable Milt 
Crandall; but with the usual array 
of japing. • spectators and flying 
wagers as to the outcome. Grim 
endurance was .nanifestcd by the 
sole contestant—an inmate of Mag- 
fie Murpli—but the prize of a lunch­
eon, strangely enough, was refused 
after the bet had been won .

purple tie of Master Charles Selsam 
must be considered, too. Isabelle 
Levin tells us that Peg Jackson 
doesn’t want her name in print this 
week. We’ll see that it stays out. 
The picture showing the Cwens, who 
had charge of the recent benefit 
bridge, which appeared in one of fie 
local papers made it look as though 
there was • a halo around the fair 
head of Janet McClelland. Maybe 
we’re wrong. Rumor has it that the 
great Lutch was seen in the base­
ment of Margaret Morrison one day 
last week. Wouldn’t surprise us now 
if Russ Kambach appeared at the 
Women’s Junior Prom. Speaking of. 
embarrassing moments, we .wonder 
how Jack Burroughs felt when he 
pulled a “Reigels" at the game last 
week.

Saturday. Close races were the 
order of the day, and places were

gave the big thrill. Here Shafer

showed signs of strength, but we 
cannot dispute the fact that Kiski

score. A majority of our points 
were compiled by Coulter, Cadmus. 
Jerge and Franke.

PLEBES OVERWHELM
On Writing Themes 
, On one of those rather, warm 
evenings last week .1 was sitting 
before the fraternity house fire­
place reading an anthology of 
modern Swedish poetry when two 
of our pledges came slowly into 
the room; and sat down on the 
other divan. 1 looked up from my 
book to take the cigarette one of 
them offered • me, and noticed 
strightway the very doleful expres­
sion on their faces. One of them 
bi.gan nervously tapping his knee 
with a thick pad of paper. The 
other carefully put down a large 
¦bottle of ink on the niantlcpiccc, 
and began filling two enormous 
fountain pens.
"It’s Thursday night, theme 
night," they both explained to­
gether, as they scratchcd a couple 
of matches to light my cigarette.
“We’ve the rottcncst subject," 
one of them said. “We’ve got to 
write about joining a fraternity. 
Think of writing on a silly subject 
like that. Why don’t they give^us 
something we can write about? 
Why don’t they let us write some­
thing on something we know, some­
thing about?" He began knawing 
the end of his pen, and staring at 
the ceiling dismally. "Cardo, old 
bean," he went on affectionately, 
“you used to have to write themes 
oncc; help me think of a title. 
Shall I call it., “On Joining a Fra­
ternity,” or should 1 omit the prc- 
position_ for brevity, or perhaps 
indeed, omit the preposition and 
replace the indefinite with the de­
finite article, or better still," lie 
Concluded, "and I have it now, "A 
Fraternity Joint.”" While I was 
hesitating to give him my opinion, 
he scrawled the title across his 
paper in large black letters, and 
then began drawing a procession 
of grotesque figures underneath it.
The other plcbc meanwhile had 
been mournfully chewing a piece 
of gum. running his hand through 
hi.' hair, and pulling it out, hair 
by hair, as lie ended his sentences. 
1 (old him 1 had just finished 
reading the copy somebody else 
had borrowed of “The Ghost in 
the Drain Pipe," and wouldn’t he 
like to borrow it. He stared at 
in surprise. "Well, you are 
going to1 need a hair raiser if you 
keep on,” I said, "but after all, a

a few minutes left during the first

Coming back at the start 61 the

Prof. William H. Brown, Jr., 
recently spent a day in "humilia­
tion and prayer," hoping it would 
bring up the scholastic average of 
his engineering class.
The North Carolina State col­
lege students who make up Pro­
fessor Brown's class in electrical 
engineering averaged \2'/i per cent 
in an examination.
When they appeared for class re­
cently they found this notice ^on 
the door:
“The papers from' the class, arc 
the poorest 1 .ever got in 20 years’ 
teaching*—it would be wise 'not to 
bother me for the-’ rest of the week, 
which 1 must spend in humiliation 
and • prayer.
would probably prefer “The Gor« 
Stained Chimney Brick.” You know 
there’s a rumor the book was writ­
ten by a Tech masonry instructor." 
"Cardo,” replied the plcbe severe­
ly, "i’m not beany enough to 
understand your nonsense. But 
how will this do to finish a para­
graph, ‘Consequently to know that 
spirit of real brotherhood is the 
best reason for getting pledged’?”
1 was about to suggest an altera­
tion of some sort, when the first 
plcbc, who had finally got one 
sentence written down, demanded 
my judgment of it. “ ‘Every
freshman should join a good fra­
ternity eagerly if he gets a chance.’ 
Don’t you like my expression, ’a 
good fraternity,’ ” lie asked. “You 
sec, I want my meaning to be quite 
clear,” he explained, "a good fra­
ternity, that is, one like ours.” 
"Yes,” 1 agreed, "no one could 
misunderstand.”
“But what troubles me,” lie went 
on, “is the position of that adjec­
tive, ‘eagerly? Its a nice problem 
in unity, you see. Is it better to 
say, ‘Eagerly every freshman,’ oc, 
‘Every freshman eagerly,’ or, 
‘should eagerly join,’ or, ‘should 
join eagerly?’ If you were writing 
this theme, Cardo, tell me where 
you would put that word.”
I was about to tell him, when 
one of the sophomores came into 
the room and ordered the fresh­
men to go down to the corner 
drug store to get him an ice 
cream and a tube of pink tooth 
paste. They tried to persuade
him they would get F’s if the 
themes weren't done, or at least 
to write the themes for them, if
they got his stuff, but lie laughed 
at them, reminded them that they 
would probably get F’s anyhow,
gave them each a black mark for 
trying to get out of doing what 
lie asked them, and told them to 
come back anti get their help from 
me, if they had to.
They ran out of the room with 
a hoot, urging -me- to stay around 
to read their compositions when 
they finished them, to put in any 
punctuation or verbs they had for­
gotten. I had little desire to do 
this, so 1 left the House, too, to 
smoke a cigarette with my friend 
Roger in his room, before I came 
back to go to bed.

WOMEN’S ATHLETICS—(Continued from Page 5) 
VOLLEYBALLThe spring sports season will open this week with the first volley­ball practice tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12:30. The volleyball season, under the management of Grace Jarvis, will terminate the first week of April in a class tournament. Practices for volleyball, which is a minor sport, will be held every day at 12:30. As there will be 18 practice periods in the season, women who expect lo be />n class teams must attend at least half of these practices.If the women support volleyball this year as they have in the past and as they have Hupporicd the present basketball season,\thcre will be a second team as well as a first to.enable more women to receive team points.
Although the basketball season was, on the whole, a success, it was a failure as far as freshman . participation goes. With the opening ol 
the spring sports season the freshmen are urged lo redeem themselves by more active participation in Carnegie athletics. The volleyball man­
ager especially asks all freshman women to comb over for the opening practice tomorrow. Volleyball is really great fun.
