Tech, Pitt, Join For 
Better News Broadcast
While the United States is cooperating with Europe to 
bring television views joint broadcasts from both continents, 
two radio stations in Pittsburgh are swapping programs on 
a smaller, but similar, scale. WRCT at Tech and WPGH at 
the University of Pittsburgh have achieved a “first” in college 
broadcasting by simultaneously*
broadcasting one show from their 
separate stations a mile and a 
,£alf apart.
At 9 and 11 p.m. every night, 
WRCT and WPGH jointly present 
news coverage and music. This 
plan enables both stations to give 
more complete news coverage to 
students of both universities at 
the same time. The Pitt station 
receives mainly national and in­
ternational news, while Tech con­
tributes better coverage on the 
local level. The two stations have 
%lso cooperated on such coverage 
as the November 6 election, Pres­
ident Kennedy’s addresses to the 
nation, and other special news ev­
ents.
Jim Levy, program director at 
Tech, and Jay Levin at WPGH, 
disc jockeyed the first simulcast 
program. They began the ex­
change playing taps ana records, 
giving news headlines, time 
C^hecks, and comments. The sta- 
" tions have now expanded these 
spot programs to whole shows as 
they have improved broadcasting 
techniques. The exchange is 
scheduled to continue all the 
school year.
Doug Pope, in charge of the 
arrangements at Tech, planned 
the joint venture with Dan John­
son, general manager of the sta­
tions at Pitt. The two kept a direct 
^>hone line open during the first 
broadcast to insure the operation’s 
smooth running and to confer on 
any technical problems.
Student Congress
Next meeting of Student Con­
gress will be on November 28. 
&A11 members are urged to attend.
Sidney Harth 
Tours Ky, Tex 
Next Week
Sidney Harth, head of Tech’s 
department of music, will make a 
brief playing and conducting tour 
of Houston, Tex. and Louisville, 
Ky. next week.
CARNEG ISTUO
Mr. Harth, internationally 
known violinist, appeared with 
the Houston Symphony, conduct­
ed by Sir John Barbirolli, on Oc­
tober 29 and 30, as soloist in the 
Beethoven Violin Concerto. It was 
Mr. Harth’s second appearance 
with the orchestra in the last 
year.
On November 2, he conducted 
the Louisville Orchestra and 
Choral Society in a program 
which included the Brandenburg 
Concerto No. 3 by J. S. Bach, 
Schubert’s Mass in G, and the 
Lord Nelson Mass by Haj'dn.
ARPA Offers 
Research Grant 
For Defense
A unique research grant of 
$400,000 has been made to CIT 
by the Advanced Research Pro­
jects Agency (ARPA), a division 
of the Department of Defense.
The grant was made for a 
one-year period and will be used 
to continue research in the areas 
of computer programming, lan­
guages, the theory of program­
ming, artificial intelligence, the 
interpretation of natural langu­
ages, man-computer reaction, and 
the design of computing machines. 
An unusual feature of the grant 
is that ARPA, which is primarily 
interested in the military appli­
cations of command and control, 
is supporting a broad, on-going 
program of fundamental, profes­
sional studies whose eventual ap­
plications are not limited directly 
to military matters.
For several years, Carnegie 
Tech has been a major center in 
information processing and has 
made significant contributions to 
knowledge in that field. The 
new grant will supply funds for 
part-time support of the two 
principal investigators, Alan J. 
Perlis, head of the mathematics 
department, and Allen Neyell, in­
stitute professor of systems and 
communication sciences; Bert 
Green, new head of the psychol­
ogy department, and one other 
prominent senior member of the 
faculty. It will also support six 
research assistantships for grad­
uate students and postdictoral 
fellows. In addition, a consider­
able portion of the grant will go 
toward the purchase of new and 
advanced equipment for use with 
Carnegie Tech’s computer, thus 
assuring long-term continuance 
of the research.
The Carnegie Tech research 
group is concerned with the de­
velopment of information pro­
cessing as a science, and with 
its application to the understand­
ing of human mental processes. 
ARPA is concerned with com­
mand and control systems; and in 
accelerating the solution to the 
incredibly difficult problems these 
systems pose.

Tuition Increased;
Effective ’63 -’64
Pres. Warner Speaks On Education, 
Need Of Aid For Economic Growth
A tuition increase of $250 per 
year will go into effect at Car­
negie Institute of Technology be­
ginning in September, 1963. The 
increase, announced today by Dr. 
J. C. Warner, President, will bring 
Carnegie Tech’s all-inclusive tui­
tion to $1450 per year.
In making the announcement, 
Dr. Warner said, “We have stu­
died all possible alternatives to 
this tuition raise. Although our in­
come is steadily increasing 
through professional management 
of endowment funds, and by seek­
ing additional endowments and 
gifts, expenses continue to out­
strip income. I fully realize the 
burden this decision will place on 
Carnegie Tech students and their 
parents, and wish to assure them 
that we plan also to extend our 
program of student aid to help 
offset any financial burdens which 
arise.”
With this increase the cost of 
attending Carnegie Tech will be 
about the same as such institu­
tions as Case Institute of Tech- 
nolgy, the University of Pennsyl 
vania, the University of Chicago, 
and Lehigh University, and some­
what less than Massachusetts In­
stitute of Technology, California 
Institute of Technology, Johns 
Hopkins University, and the uni­
versities in the Ivy League.
Carnegie Tech’s last tuition in­
crease which raised tuition from 
$1000 to $1200 went into effect in 
September, 1961. Despite that in­
crease, Tech finds itself operating 
at a very substantial deficit for 
this year.
Income from tuition has tradi­
tionally accounted for only about 
50% of the total educational costs 
at Carnegie Tech and that figure 
will not change significantly even 
with this increase, according to 
Mr. Richard E. Strathmeyer, vice 
president for business affairs. 
“While Carnegie Tech’s operating 
expenses have been rising at a 
rate of betwen 8 and 11 percent 
per year for about the last eight 
years,” said Mr. Strathmeyer, “we 
have not attempted to compensate 
for all this increased cost through
? If America is to compete in the 
race against dictatorships and 
thus survive as a free society, if 
America is to solve its unemploy­
ment problem, and if America is 
to experience a desired rate of 
economic growth, we have no al­
ternative to giving increasing sup­
port to higher education.
This was the conclusion reached 
by President J. C. Warner, in an 
address entiled “Related Unsolved 
problems — U.S.A.,” delivered 
vVednesday, November 7, before a 
dinner meeting of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Cleveland, held 
in Columbus, Ohio.
Dr. Warner identified the four 
related unsolved problems as:
!• Maintaining or hopefully im­
proving our position in the sci­
entific, technological, economic, 
and ideological race with the 
Soviet Union.
2. Solving the pressing unemploy­
ment problen.
3. Generating a desired adequate 
rate of economic growth.
4. Planning and supporting the 
right kind of education and 
training of first-rate quality and 
inadequate quantity.
According to Dr. Warner, it is
doubtful that adequate progress 
can be made on any of the first 
three without making progress on 
the fourth.
Explaining the relationships of 
each of the problems, Dr. Warner 
said, “In this race with the So­
viets, we need all the professional, 
scholarly, creative, and inventive 
people we can get. We need espe­
cially scientists, technologists, and 
administrators educated to the 
highest level of competence. We 
cannot maintain or improve our 
position in the race without them
— in space explorations — in 
missiles, aircraft, nuclear arma­
ment, and other devices essential 
tc the security of ourselves and 
the free world — in providing 
technical aid to improve the lot of 
people in the underdeveloped 
countries so they hopefully will 
choose the way of freedom and 
shun the path to serfdom.
“And to maintain or improve 
our position in the race, we must 
of course maintain a sound eco­
nomy. Should we fail to solve 
our problems of unemployment 
and inadequate economic growth, 
while persisting in the politically 
difficult posture of maintaining a 
relatively stable price level, I feel 
sure the outcome at some future 
date would be economic chaos. 
Whereupon our people would look 
for a Messiah — our efforts in the 
[continued on page 3]
tuition alone. Fortunately we 
have for the past several years 
had an increase in the return on 
our endowment, plus additional 
gifts and grants, thus enabling 
us to bear a good part of rising 
costs without passing them on to 
the students. In addition,” he 
concluded, “the efforts of the de­
velopment division havt made it 
possible for Carnegie Tech to 
erect many new buildings in the 
last five years without using in­
come from tuition for that pur­
pose.”
Dr. Warner cited competition 
for outstanding faculty members 
as one of the primary reasons for 
additional income. The competi­
tion has been compounded recent­
ly, he said, with the emphasis be­
ing placed by the government on 
obtaining qualified personnel in 
all areas, but especially in engi­
neering and science where NASA, 
for instance, has need of more 
Ph.D.’s than all colleges com­
bined are producing.
“If Carnegie Tech is to remain 
an institution of the first rank,” 
concluded the Carnegie Tech 
president, “we must be able to 
continue to retain and attract fac­
ulty members of the highest dis­
tinction. In order to do this, we 
must be able to compete in all 
ways including salary scales, and 
this means that we must have in­
creased resources available.”
Hay es Offers 
Play Criticism
Tuesday, November 27, two 
days before the start of the Drama 
Department’s run of Shakespeare’s 
Othello, Professor Ann L. Hayes 
will discuss the play at 11:30 in 
the Fine Arts Theater as part of 
the regular Tuesday assembly 
series. The program will be open 
to the whole school. In 1953 the 
Department of English establish­
ed the practice of having a mem­
ber of the Department talk on the 
drama department’s current 
Shakespearean production.
Mrs. Hayes, who has been at 
Carnegie Tech since 1957, is an 
assistant professor of English. She 
is a graduate of Stanford Univer­
sity where she also received her 
master’s degree. She is a poet 
and this summer she read some 
of her original poetry at the 
Shakespeare festival at Ashland, 
Oregon.
ODK Honorary 
Selects Two 
New Members
Two new members were tapped 
last week by Omicron Delta Kap­
pa, the senior men’s Honorary. 
John Bertucci and Bob Stocking 
were selected from the top 35% 
of the men students of their class 
and college, on the basis of lead­
ership and active participation in 
various campus organizations such 
as religious groups, Congress, and 
Student Court.
ODK, a national leadership 
Honorary, has three main pur­
poses; to recognize and inspire 
leadership, to help mold campus 
sentiment, and to bring together 
faculty and students on the basis 
of mutual interest and under­
standing.
This year the Tech circle (chap­
ter) will, as its primary function, 
work with the Admissions office 
in establishing personal contact 
with High School students. This 
program will include a series of 
formal presentations by ODK 
members at local schools, con­
cerning the students’ future.
Presently comprised of two 
faculty members, Dr. Mark Ellis, 
the official advisor, and Dean Earl 
Swank, and nine student mem­
bers, Chip McKnight, President, 
Dennis Gary, Vice-P resident, 
Marty Ackermann, Secretary, 
Wayne Tamarelli, Treasurer, Tom 
Ference, Henry Henderson, A1 
Kullen, John Bertucci, and Bob 
Stocking, Omicron Delta Kappa 
exemplifies excellence in school 
service.

Oh, sure, you’ve been busy, what with going to classes, doing 
jour homework, catching night crawlers, getting married — 
but can’t you pause for just a moment and give thought to that 
dear, dedicated, lonely man in the big white house on the hill? 
I refer, of course, to the Prexy.
(It is interesting to note here that college presidents are al­
ways called “Prexy.” Similarly, trustees are called “Trixie.” 
Associate professors are called “Axy-Pixy.” Bursars are called 
“Foxy-Woxy.’’ Students are called “Algae.”)
But I digress. We were speaking of the Prexy, a personage at 
once august and pathetic. Why pathetic? Well sir, consider how 
Prexy spends his days. He is busy, busy, busy. He talks to 
deans, he talks to professors, he talks to trusteees, he talks to 
alumni. In fact, he talks to everybody except the one group 
who could lift his heart and rally his spirits. I mean, of course, 
the appealingest, endearingest, winsomest group in the entire 
college—>’ou, the students.
It is the Prexy’s sad fate to be forever a stranger to your 
laughing, golden selves. He can only gaze wistfully out the 
w indow of his big white house on the hill and watch you at your 
games and sports and yearn with all his tormented heart to bask 
in your warmth. But how? It would hardly be fitting for Prexy 
to appear one day at the Union, clad in an old rowing blazer, 
end cry gaily, “Heigh-ho, chaps! Who’s for sculling?”

In place of a Thanksgiving As­

giving services held on Tuesday, 
November 13, in the Chapel, Room 
39 Skibo. At 11:30 a.m., a Protes­
tant Service will be conducted by 
the Student Christian Federation. 
At 12:30 p.m., a Roman Catholic 
Votive Mass of Thanksgiving will 
be offered. Students and faculty 
are invited to both of these special 
services.
No, friends, Prexy can’t get to you. It is up to you to get to 
him. Call on him at home. Just drop in'unannounced. He will 
naturally be a little shy at first, so you must put him at his 
ease. Shout, “Howdy-doody, sir! I have come to bring a little 
sunshine into your drear and blighted life!” Then yank his 
necktie out of his vest and scamper goatlike around him until 
he is laughing merrily aloHg with you.
Then hand him a package and say, “A little gift for you, sir."
“For me?” he will say, lowering his lids. “You shouldn’t 
have.”
“Yes, I should,” you will say, “because this package is 
a carton of Marlboro Cigarettes, and whenever I think of 
Marlboro, I think of you.”
“Why, hey?” he will say curiously.
“Because Marl boros have taste, and so do you,” you will 
reply.
“Aw, go on,” he will say, blushing furiously.
“It’s true,” you will say. “Moreover, Marlboro has a filter, 
and so do you.”
“In my1 swimming pool, you mean,” he will say.
“Yes,” you will say. “Moreover, Marlboro has a soft pack,
It can cost everything you have, or nothing. But chances are pretty good 
that when you sign your name, it’s often on a check, and probably costs 
you at least a dime. Figure the number of checks you write, multiply by 
10 cents, and that’s how much you can save with a Union National Bank 
free personal checking account. Just maintain a $200 balance and all 
your personal checks are completely free. No service charge. No mainte­
nance charge. No charge for new checks. No charge for deposits. It’s a 
good idea, and a lot of people are already taking advantage of it. Why not 
you? Stop in and see us.

' “My limp leather brief case, you mean,” he will say.
“Yes,” you will say. “Moreover, the Marlboro box lias a 
flip-top, and so do you.”
“But I don’t have a flip-top,” he will say.
“But you will,” you will say. “Just light a Marlboro, and 
taste that tasty taste, and you will surely flip your top.”
Well sir, you will have many a good chuckle about that, you 
may be sure. Then you will say, “Goodbje, sir, I will return 
soon again to brighten your lorn and desperate life.”
“Please do,” he will say. “But next time, if you can possibly 
manage it, try not to come at four in the morning.”

race would have come to naught; 
we would have exchanged our 
free society for a closed one — a 
dictatorship, possibly more hu­
mane but otherwise hardly dis­
tinguishable from the Soviet var­
iety.”
Talking about the unemploy­
ment problem, which he described 
as one “loaded with political dy­
namite," Dr. Warner pointed out 
that about three-quarters of those 
unemployed for 15 weeks or more 
had not completed high school. 
Complicating this problem is the 
fact that studies made in the last 
few years to predict the makeup 
of the labor force in 1970, indicate 
that there will be no more jobs 
for unskilled workers than there 
are now. Jobs for semi-skilled 
workers will increase only 25%. 
Yet jobs for professional and skill­
ed technical people, those persons 
with some sort of higher educa­
tion, will increase by 60%.
“It seems abundantly clear,” 
said Dr% Warner, talking about the 
impact of education on economic 
growth, “that education and voca­
tional training have a vital part to 
play in economic growth by im­
proving the quality of the work­
ing force. Furthermore, education 
has a basic role to play in im­
proving our technology through 
the basic research being done in 
our universities, the scientists and 
engineers educated by our col­
leges and universities, and the
technicians trained in our voca­
tional schools.”
The important role which high­
er education must play in find­
ing solutions to the three public 
problems mentioned, however, 
raises another problem of how to 
make is possible for education and 
training to play this key role, 
which Dr. Warner said, “can be 
ignored only at our country’s 
peril.” The problems are: What 
quantities and kinds of education 
and training must be supplied? 
How much of what we need is 
available now? What fraction of 
the gross national product must 
go to the support of education to 
do the job?
Dr. Warner believes that many 
steps have been taken in the di­
rection of solving these pressing 
problems. However, more progress 
and some changes in our present 
system of educational support 
must be made.
“For the predicted 6,440,000 
students in higher education in 
1969-70,” says Dr. Warner, “the 
annual bill would be about $9.7 
billions without inflation. If we 
assume 20% inflation, which is 
modest considering past records 
the bill would be at least $11.5 
billions.”
President Warner believes that 
the students and their parents 
must undertake a greater percent­
age of the cost of higher educa­
tion. “I’m glad to report,” he says, 
“that students and their parents 
are steadily becoming more will

ing to borrow to pay for an educa­
tion. That we still have a long 
way to go, however, is evidenced 
by the fact that the average fam­
ily has an indebtedness of $3,000 
for the purchase of homes, autos, 
and television sets, but the av­
erage outstanding loan per stu­
dent is between $20 and $30.”
A realistic and sensible way to 
meet the expanding support needs 
of higher education should be ob­
tained equally from three sources: 
(1) student tuition; (2) federal, 
state, and local governments; and 
(3) from income on endowments, 
gifts and grants, alumni, industry 
and business, foundations, and in­
dividuals. This plan would raise 
the student’s share from the ap­
proximately 25% he now pays to 
33.3%. Dr. Warner points out that 
this figure is by no means unreal­
istic since in the leading private 
institutions, students already pay 
50 to 60% of the costs.
Research Uses Computers
[continued from page 1]
A few of the current research 
programs now going on which 
will continue under the grant 
are:
1. Programming languages. Car­
negie Tech has been working on 
languages for computer outputs, 
an area which many scraps of 
systems exist but with no con­
ceptual basis. Other languages 
have been developed know tech­
nically as tring manipulation lan­
guages and list processing lan­
guages. More basically, research 
is being done in notation—that is, 
the characteristics of language 
in relation to the human user. 
This leads to important studies 
in man-computer interaction and 
the development of knowledge 
for the construction of artificial 
languages.
2. Artificial Intelligence. Mem­
bers of the faculty have been 
working for the last four years 
on a General Problem Solving 
program. Ignorance of good ways
to organize large complex pro­
grams is the principal bottleneck 
right now in the use of artificial 
intelligence. One goal of the pro­
gram is to give a machine a t?rk 
without the operator having to 
know anything about the internal 
structure of the program. Simi­
lar to the general solving pro­
gram is the chess program. Con­
structing programs to play chess 
provides valuable information 
about the complexity, sophistica­
tion, and processing power that 
are necessary to match levels of 
human performance in a difficult 
task. This program itself is de­
veloping relations to the com­
mand and control interests of 
ARPA.
3. Theory of Programming. Re­
search is going on to try to avoid 
the trial-and-error or pragmatic 
method of writing computer prob­
lems by applying mathematical 
logic so that one could judge the 
efficiency of a program by study­
ing its structure.

Alma Mater Vs. School Spirit
Last week’s editorial was an attempt to 
neutrally present the two conflicting opin­
ions concerning the plight of Tech’s Alma 
Mater. Response has been limited but cer­
tainly representative and serves to confirm 
this writer’s opinion on the matter. Those 
who are interested like the Alma Mater and 
would not have it sacrificed for some trite 
replacement. Many letters (including Mr. 
Axelrad’s column) clearly indicate that stu­
dents plainly do not care what happens to 
the Alma Mater, or even if Tech has one. I 
submit, then, that those who would change 
the Alma Mater because it is not being sung 
are being unrealistic. They would sacrifice' 
the Alma Mater in hopes of changing a camp­
us attitude that is more deeply-rooted and 
is only manifested in not singing the Alma 
Mater, among other things. There is no 
reason to support that a change of Alma 
Mater will produce a corresponding change 
in campus attitude.It has been two years since the problem of apathy has heen debated in the Tartan and I do not intend to revive it. However, Mr. Axelrad’s column opens this discussion

and his statements cannot be permitted to pass unchallenged. Interested persons will not permit him to dogmatically declare that scholastic “school spirit” and “rah! rah!’5 school spirit are of necessity mutually ex­clusive. They are not the warped analogies and irrelevancies offer no strength to this position. That the only meaningful educa­tion is one that is completely textbook taught has been and continues to be refuted by top educators on this very campus. These are the very people who first expressed con­cern about the Alma Mater!
No one is attempting to undermine the 
precious individuality which Mr. Axelrad 
has championed in the past. Yet, he is 
equally guilty of endeavoring to impress his 
views upon others. Those who preach the 
viewpoint of “who cares” are influencing a 
disproportionately large portion of the camp­
us only because we permit them to do so. 
Being anti school spirit is :‘the thing to do”! 
It is time that the pseudo-sophisticate who 
preaches this doctrine was placed in his 
proper perspective.

Techites Comment On Spirit, Views
Alma Mater Easy9 
But Unfamiliar
Editor, The Tartan:
I am gratified to find that 
somebody in concerned over the 
state of the Alma Mater. It is 
my opinion that the present Al­
ma Mater should be kept. Few 
schools have an Alma Mater as 
beautiful or impressive as ours.
I dougt very much that our 
Alma Mater is too difficult to 
sing, at least compared to 
“Fight For the Glory”. The mus­
ical interval between the high­
est and lowest notes of the lat­
ter is actually a half-tone great­
er. Furthermore, I have yet to 
hear anyone spit out the words 
to “Fight For the Glory” as- 
curately as fast as the band 
plays it in some passages. Nor 
do I consider the words overly 
obscure. There is a certain de­
gree of obscurity in most ma­
ture and serious poetry. To me, 
the other extreme—trite, com­
monplace expressions—would be 
far worse. Calling the Alma Ma­
ter too difficult or meaningless 
is insulting the intelligence of 
Tech students themselves.
By far the best way of set­
tling the question of student at­
titude is taking a poll. To my 
knowledge, no such poll has 
been taken recently. It would 
certainly be worthwhile, since 
the final decision on whether to 
retain or relinquish the present 
Alma Mater should rest with the 
students themselves.
Perhaps the worst problem has 
been sheer unlainlliarity. Out­
side of Freshman Camp, no ap­
parent effort is made to acquaint 
the students with it.
Freshman are not enough! 
Would it possible for a trained 
voice to sing it over the public 
address system at the football 
games, at least until it catches 
on? Or to hand out copies of 
the words at games? I would 
suggest that the words be print-
ed in this issue of the Tartan, 
since it is quite possible that 
many students have no idea 
what they are. Somebody study­
ing composition in our music de»- 
partment could take the second 
and third verses as well (I 
heard somewhere that such ver­
ses do exist) and make a real 
“production number” out of the 
whole thing for the Cameron 
Choir. Once something like this 
is started, it just might do as 
much to increase school spirit as 
a winning football season. If 
the students favor it, that is.
Richard Cartwright
Chem., 6'3
Last week’s editorial in the Tartan stated that Tech’s alma 
mater is not being sung, and that action should be taken to remedy 
this grave situation. The editorial implied that when Carnegie Tech 
needs, is a lot more “school spirit.” Why all this concern about 
“school spirit?” What does it symbolize?
I believe that the absence of “school spirit” symbolizes maturity 
on the part of students. Students should not be criticized for feel­
ing that other things in life are more important than cheering at 
a football game, or singing a song. A true education is orientated 
toward giving an individual a more meaningful way of life than 
one that revolves about meaningless rituals. A school that has a 
true “school spirit” is one in which the students are getting a “good” 
education, and like the school because it is furnishing the back­
ground for this learning. Tech has this “school spirit.”
A student may go to football games if he is interested in the 
spoi't, but for student “leaders” to urge all students to go is sense­
less. Do these “leaders” believe that going to school activities broad­
ens a person socially? If so, why do they not urge students to have 
sexual intercourse? This is certainly broadening. Of course the idea 
is ridiculous — people can make their own decisions. Cheering may 
be a form of release, but if a person is stable without feeling a 
need for such an outlet, why urge him to do something he has no 
natural inclination to do?
The persistence of calls for increased spirit is a good example 
of conformity. (Today there are few good examples left — everyone 
is trying so hard to be a non-conformist.) Other schools generate 
great enthusiasm, so why not Tech? At Ohio State 69 thousand 
people cheer the school team, and at “Old Miss” nearly the entire 
school turned out just to welcome a new student—although in all 
fairness» I doubt if many people would like to see that happen 
here. Many would like to see CIT have a good football team, 
“school spirit,” etc. “School spirit” makes a school more “collegi­
ate.” Most other schools are “collegiate.” Perhaps the majority 
view is wrong! This was not even considered.
I suggest an alternative for Carnegie Institute of Technology: 
Let the students do as they please. If a person wants to sing—let 
him. If someone feels that Tech should have ‘school spirit,” let him 
write about it. If the students don’t give a damn, allow'them to 
follow their chosen path. But above all let it be printed that a 
school does not have to have “school spirit.”

Football Team
Editor, The Tartan:
Last Saturday Carnegie com­
pleted a football season that was 
not impressive in terms of wins 
and losses. However, the win- 
loss record does not give details 
and so does not tell the story 
of the season.
Tech’s loss to Westminister 
was a hard - fought contest 
against a team that out-weighed 
us 15 to 20 pounds per man. 
We played smart, aggressive 
football and almost upset them. 
Our team played the same kind 
of football against Ohio Wes­
leyan, Waynesburg, Franklin 
and Marshall, W and J, and St. 
Vincent’s. In all of these games 
our opponents were made to 
realize that the Tech team had 
ability plus the desire to win. It 
is agreed that we had let-downs 
with Grove City and Denison. 
This can and does happen to 
most teams.
In a final analysis of our 
football season. Tech did well. 
With the “breaks” we might 
have won another game or even 
two. Most important of all is 
the fact hat our men played to 
win and tried hard to do so! 
Each member of the squad de­
serves the thanks and congratu­
lations of the school. I am proud 
of the efforts of both the team 
members and the coaches.

“Scrod” Article 
In Poor Taste
Editor, The Tartan:
We feel that the printing of 
the song “Eating Skibo Scrod” 
was in very bad taste. A few 
picky individuals get a little 
meat in their grissle and immed­
iately a barrage of complaints is 
directed at the hard working 
Skibo staff.
Our opinion is that the diet is 
very well planned and that the 
meals are quite tasty. Take 
breakfast for instance; maybe 
the powerded eggs aren’t so 
good, but the dry cereal is ter­
rific and the hotcakes are the 
kind your really have to sink 
your teeth into. At dinner the 
water is cold and clear, and the 
fresh, melt-in-your-mouth rolls 
literally fall apart when you 
slam them down on the table. 
Just think, where else could you 
get such mouth watering com­
binations as bacon and liver, 
veal loaf jnd turkey gravy, fried 
scrod, or pineapple herkimer on 
toast. Another thing you never 
have to worry about it burning 
your tongue. The writers of 
this song would probably be 
happy to know that they can 
find their fried crackerjacks 
simply by opening the stuffed 
peppers before they wolf them 
down.
We do, however, realize that 
some of the complaints are 
valid, but the number of people 
who have complained of having 
their spoons sucked down into 
the bowl by the hot cereal is 
insignificant compared to the 
countless thousands who have 
managed to enjoy this dish.
We sincerely hope that this 
letter does not strum the bod of 
the writers of the song, and if 
they really do not like the food 
at Skibo they can go eat some­
where ¿Ise, like Stouffer’s.

Editor, The Tartan:
Professor Huff (Readers

have sold his issues for a mess 
of verbiage. For those who find 
elegence — or at least intelligi- yp 
bility — in simplicity we offer 
an amusement. The participant 
may compare his choices with 
those of the experts at the end 
of each part.

every occurrence of any form of

Wells Questions 
Wolfenstein View
Editor, The Tartan:
In response to Professor Wolf- 
stein’s speech to the Theta Xi 
brothers and his open letter to 
President Kennedy, I would like 
* to pose several questions. I can 
not and shall not attempt to save 
the world with rhetoric, but per­
haps our Physics Dept, philoso­
pher could come a bit closer to 
doing so if he were to consider 
these queries:
1.What proof exists which can 
substantiate that “the missiles 
stationed with the Soviet Un­
ion are adequate to annihilate 
the military potential of theu.s?”
2. Is the existence of our defen­
sive or offensive forces “around 
the Soviet Union” capable of 
consideration within the same 
frame of reference as che es­
tablishment of Soviet offensives 
in Cuba? Is the latter not a 
Hemispheric situation rather 
than a national one? Is there 
the bond of mutuality be­
tween the nations of the East­
ern Hemisphere that there is 
between those of the Western? ‘
3. In this respect, was our Pres­
ident’s concern merely a na­
tional one?
4. Similarly, what is the relation 
of our Soviet-proximitv AFB’s 
to the nations of Europe, that 
of India, of Japan, as well as 
to the Soviet Union?
5. In another light (hopefully not 
that of Mr. Axelrad’s candle),
^ if now is the time to “urge” 
mutual dismantling of bases, 
what has the Geneva Confer­
ence been engaged in four 
months now?
6. Further, are the leaders of the 
East and the West not so fully 
aware of the vastness of nu­
clear war that they will not 
make every effort to engage in 
peaceful negotiations (even at 
the risk of compromise) before
fa* unleashing a nuclear hell? 
(Let us disregard Communist 
China on this point.)
When Professor Wolfstein 
clearly evaluates the Cuban sit­
uation and answers these ques­
tions, then I am certain that we 
shall all know when to expect his 
full-scale nuclear war. In which 
case, we can all purchase hold­
ings in Shelters Amalgamated and 
to do a bit of preparatory read- 
9 on animal cultures.

Grants Aid For 
Study Abroad
Mr. R. J. Cameron, an alum­
nus of Carnegie Tech, makes 
available each year a grant of 
$2,000 to be given to a male stu­
dent who will study abroad fol­
lowing graduation from Carnegie. 
The purpose of the grant is to 
enable the student to participate 
more fully in the cultural, so­
cial, and intellectual activity of 
the country he is studying in, to 
give him greater freedom to 
0^ learn about its government, its 
economy, its political and social 
institutions. The grant, therefore, 
is made available only to stu­
dents who have already com­
pleted arrangements for study 
abroad and who have obtained 
financial support adequate to take 
care of the year’s study.
Graduating seniors who plan to 
study abroad during the academic 
year, 1963-64, should some to the 
office of the Committee on Fi­
nancial Aid to learn more about 
the Cameron Grant and confer 
with Dean Swank about the 
special provisions of it. The Com­
mittee on Financial Aid hopes es­
pecially that students applying for 
Fulbright grants or other special 
foreign study awards will inves­
tigate the provisions of the Cam­
eron grant which can provide an 
extremely helpful supplement to 
their resources while abroad.
Dr. Ellis, of the Tech History 
Department, was the guest speak­
er at the Pi Kappa Alpha Frater­
nity last Thursday evening. He 
presented a summary of the 
Cuban crisis, its historical de­
velopment, and its implications in 
the areas of international rela­
tions and domestic policies.
He emphasized the efficiency 
with which the United States gov­
ernment acted in the crisis, ob­
taining the necessary intelligence 
reports and making and backing 
up crucial decisions. This w a s 
contrasted to the previous bung­
ling of the Cuban situation during 
the Kennedy Administration. Dr. 
Ellis pointed out the action of the 
Central Intelligence Agency in 
providing essential data, includ­
ing photographs which were em­
ployed in our international diplo­
matic contacts during .and im­
mediately after the crisis, the dip­
lomatic success of Secretary of 
State Rusk at the OAS, and the 
general spirit of unity behind the 
President’s action. This unity 
within the United States and the 
strong front which we have pre­
sented has renewed confidence in 
our nation’s position on the part 
of the people of the world as well 
as renewing patriotism and con­
fidence on the part of Americans. 
It has provided a shot in the arm 
to a sagging defense of our world 
position, where we heretofore had 
backed down rather than pressing 
our point on crucial issues.
Dr. Ellis noted the sentiment in 
Britain and among certain ele­
ments of other allies, as well as in 
some neutralist countries, that the 
United States has been guilty of 
sabre rattling. It is clear that, in
order to back up the stand which 
our nation is taking against ad­
vancing, aggressive Communism, 
we have violated international 
agreements concerning freedom 
on the seas in setting up the quar­
antine. The United States has as­
sumed a position potentially forc­
ing an outbreak of violence. This 
occurred, Dr. Ellis observed, par­
ticularly in the inferences which 
President Kennedy made of a pos­
sible air strike on Cuba and the 
increased military buildup in the 
area. He also explained the ap­
parent desire on the part of our 
Joint Chiefs of Staff to carry out

Swank’s Lecture 
Endorses Greeks
On the evening of Oct. 31, 
Dean Swank, Dean of Men, spoke 
at the Alpha Tau Omega pledge 
meeting. The Dean’s message w^as 
twofold. He described his and 
the school’s feeling about frater­
nities, and secondly, he gave 
words of advice to the new 
pledges. In describing the school’s 
policy toward fraternities, he 
stressed that the administration 
feels that the fraternity is an 
important adjunct of college life. 
Because of the beneficial effects 
that fraternities have had on the 
development of students, the dean 
advised the pledges to work hard 
in order to understand and be­
come a valuable member of the 
fraternity.
Everyman’s art, his handwrit- 
* ing, was the core of Professor Ar-
! nold Bank’s talk at Theta Xi Fra-Iternity last Tuesday. Giving a 
’ visual presentation of pertinent 
| styles of handwriting as he talked,
] Professor Bank traced the histor- 
j ical evolution of our twentieth 
century handwriting from the 
middle of the fifteenth century 
to the present.
He reflected that the invention 
of printing had two distinct effects 
1 on handwriting; it de-emphasized 
the importance of handwriting in 
mass communication, and provid- | 
ed a means of standardizing styles 
of writing—comparing and ulti­
mately combining them. By 1476 
the invention of printing had 
spread to most of the cultural 
centers of Europe; it spread from 
Germany in about 1450 to Italy 
in 1465, to France in 1470, to 
Spain in 1473, and finally to Eng­
land in 1476. While most of the 
printing then was done in Latin, 
each of the spacial advances 
made by printing brought new 
type faces. And in these faces 
were reflected the handwritings 
of people. The mechanics and 
mood of the Blackletter and Sec­
retary of Germany, the Italian 
Hand of Italy, the Cancellarescha, 
the English Roundhand, and many 
others are reflected in the type 
I faces of the time.
Thus, when Spencer designed 
the cursive handwriting with 
! which most of us are familiar, 
he was afforded a storehouse of 
knowledge about the characteris­
tics of different handwritings. By 
choosing and combining the char­
acteristics of these designs that 
he wanted, clearness,, openness, 
and fluidity, he developed a style 
J of handwriting which, if written 
! carefully and correctly, is as 
I beautiful as it is functional.

Buildings of Paul Schweikher 
Shown At Carnegie Institute
Material and Form in Buildings 
by Paul Schweikher, a photo­
graphic exhibition of buildings 
designed by the Head of the De­
partment of Architecture at Car­
negie Tech, will open at Carnegie 
Institute on Wednesday, Novem­
ber 21, to be shown through De­
cember 19. Representing work 
from the beginning of his career 
to the present, the exhibit has 
been assembled by former stu­
dents in the Department as a tri­
bute to Mr. Schweikher. Fea­
tured will be photographs of 
completed buildings and design 
projects, such as his recent Ford 
Foundation Theater Project.
Paul Schweikhers carreer as an 
architect and educator has placed 
him in the vanguard of contem­
porary architectural thought. In 
addition to his present duties at 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
he is a member of the Advisory 
Council of Princeton University, 
and a Director of many profes­
sional organizations; he has 
served on design juries and has 
himself been the recipient of 
many awards and prizes. His 
travels have taken him on exten­
sive tours of Europe, South Amer­
ica, and Japan.
After undergraduate studies in 
painting, sculpture, and archi­
tecture, he received his Bache­
lor of Fine Arts from Yale Uni­
versity in 1929. Mr. Schweikher 
began practicing architecture in 
Chicago in 1934, and has since 
been involved in diversified pro­
jects throughout the United States 
and abroad. One of his early 
buildings, a Unitarian Church in 
Oak Park, is recognized as an 
architectual landmark in the Chi-

an attack on Cuba and the de­
cision on the part of the President 
to gamble, on the basis of his in­
telligence reports, on the stand the 
Soviet Union would take in the 
crisis.
There is concern over future j 
crises among these allies and neu­
tralists as to the steps the United 
States will take in the future. 
Does this action set a precedent 
for the United States to take the 
offensive in other situations? If 
so, Dr. Ellis states, our allies may 
again be left entirely out of the 
decision-m a k i n g position. We 
could accept all responsibility for 
thg free world’s stand, by passing 
the United Nations in the wake 
of a fast-developing crisis.
Dr. Ellis suggested that our 
allies will assert themselves more 
strongly now — that additional 
gravity has been placed upon the 
balance of power in the world. He 
emphasized the involvement of 
two “super powers” in the Cuban 
situation and the essential lack 
of power of other nations. Perhaps 
the neutralist countries will begin to asert themselves not, as they 
realize their lack of voice in the 
world’s future, the future of hu­
manity.
Dr. Ellis feels that action of the 
United States show the solidarity 
of the free world and the power 
it has to stall and reverse Com­
munist advances. The effect of the 
questioning of such strong action 
on our part will be felt as new 
crises develop, but the strength of

Elaine Hinkel, Pan-Hel President, 
Explains Sororities, Their Goals
$Sorority rush is fast approach­
ing its peak. Because of this Tech- 
ites may be interested in learning 
more about Pan Hellenic Council, 
which governs our sororities, and 
its president, Elaine Hinkel.
Elaine is a senior music major 
with options in piano performance 
and music education. She hails 
from Johnstown, Pa.
^ Elaine’s activities include Pan- 
Hellenic Council, Kappa Kappa 
Gamma, past president of Sigma 
Alpha Iota, Tech chorus accom­
panist, Phi Kappa Phi, Under­
graduate Advisory Committee, 
Executive Council of Student- 
Congress, Mortar Board, Phi Tau 
Gamma, and Shadyside Presby­
terian Church Junior Choir.
Elaine’s interests are not con­
fined to music, however. She also 
enjoys tennis, philosophy, travel 
and art. Her future plans include 
graduate school.
In explaining the function of 
Pan-Hel and sorority, Elaine had
this to say:
Sorority: the most intriguing
word in the vocabulary of every 
new college woman. Just what 
^loes it mean? What do they do? 
Why should girls be interested?
A sorority is instrumental in 
helping to mold a well-rounded 
pex'sonality. It performs a function 
that no other part of the school 
could. To set down the educational 
social and individual-personal ad­
vantages of a sorority is an easy 
task: sororities work together in 
maintaining and encouraging high 
scholastic achievement, high ideals 
V^nd high social standards; they 
offer a place wherein there is a 
warm congeniality and bond of 
friendship; and they provide the 
opportunity for developing quali­
ties of leadership via practical ex­
periences where sound and ma­
ture judgment is needed. To con­
vey the deeper and finer values of 
a sorority would be impossible by 
the use of mere words.
a)PH’s scholarship program this 
year will stress more than ever 
the necessity for maintaining 
high scholastic standards. To­
ward this end, each sorority has 
been asked to articulate and 
emphasize its own scholarship 
program. In addition, PH will 
sponsor several lectures (nota­
bly by Dr. Robert Morgan of the 
Guidance Department, and Dr. 
Irwin Steinberg, Dean of Mar­
garet Morrison) which will 
highlight both the “How to” and 
“Why” of this subject.
b) PH has continued to urge at­
tendance at lectures.
c) Public Relations: news to
hometown papers, Tartan.
3) Cooperate with Freshmen and 
independents via providing an 
opportunity for them to get to 
know and ask questions about 
the sororities. The second of 
these functions was Saturday, 
October 20, the first was held 
in September and was high­
lighted by a fashion show and 
discussions.
Pan-Hel is also sponsoring an 
exchange student, Cecile Flad.
Y-Seminar Offers Techites 
Opportunity To See Neiv York
A Four Day Seminar in New sentative of the United Nation*
York City, “Spotlight on New 
York,” focusing on the United 
Nations, the Theater, and the 
City, will be sponsored by the 
Campus YMCA and YWCA, be­
tween semesters, Tuesday, Janu­
ary 29 to Friday, February 1, 
1963. It will be open to all stu­
dents and faculty, whether or not 
they are Y members. The total 
cost of the seminar will not ex­
ceed $15 which will include tick­
ets for two plays and the Metro­
politan Opera, a tour of the 
United Nations and at least one 
dinner in a nationality restaurant. 
Participants are responsible for 
their own transportation, room 
and meals, although the Y will be 
glad to make arrangements for 
travel via Greyhound bus and 
rooms at the YMCA or YWCA 
or an inexpensive hotel. Since 
theater tickets must be purchased 
well in advance, the deadline for 
registrations will be 4:00 P.M. 
Tuesday, December 4, accom­
panied by a $10 deposit. (The 
deposit would be refundable if 
another person can be found to 
take the place of the one cancel­
ing.) The tentative program in­
cludes a tour of the U.N. Build­
ing, an interview with a repre-
Secretariat, observing a commit­
tee in session if any are meeting 
at that time; attending two plays, 
probably “Man for All Seasons” 
and “Who’s Afraid of Virginia 
Woolfe?” plus attending the Met­
ropolitan Opera, and opportunity 
to interview a drama critic and 
possibly some of the cast of on« 
of the plays; interview with a 
member of the special police unit 
working with juvenile delin­
quents, with a social agency 
youth gang worker, a visit to 
Night Court; an interview with 
staff of the N.Y. Housing Author­
ity for a picture of slum clear­
ance program, pros and cons of 
public housing, etc., and visits to 
some projects; interview with 
Howard Moody, minister of the 
Judson Memorial Church on 
Washington Square and one of the 
most unusual churches in Amer­
ica; plus some free time for mu­
seums and other sightseeing, as 
well as meals in famous nation­
ality restaurants.
Discuss this with your families 
over Thanksgiving vacation and 
come early to register. Here is an 
opportunity to get acquainted 
with New York at a deeper level 
than the usual tourist may do.
Assignment: find a fitter paper that 
works harder the dirthrit gets
c)President - in - training: PHC 
has asked the sorority who will 
have the presidency next year 
to elect her now so that she can 
work closely with this year’s 
president and thus be fully pre­
pared to advance Pan-Hel’s 
standards during her term of 
office.
2) Faculty and Administration:

Tech Almost Holds Westminster; 
Plays Hard For Coach's Last Game
by John Blue
“They had a lean and hungry 
year . . . Such teams are danger­
ous,” to paraphrase Shakespeare 
a bit, but the phrasing certainly 
fitted the Tartan football team last 
Saturday. The mighty Westmin­
ster Titans, once-beaten this year 
against stiff competition, came to 
the Tech bowl to play a Tartan 
team that had certainly had a lean 
and hungry year, and were lucky 
to emerge with their slim win 
13-7.
It was obviously a case of one 
team being tremendously “up” for 
a game, and the other being fat 
and complacent. A great deal of 
the spirit was due to the attitude, 
“Let’s win the last one for the 
coach.” Head Football coach Eddie 
Hirshberg, who just three days 
before had submitted his resig­
nation to Atheltic Director Mel 
Cratsley, also thought the same. 
“They just wanted to win this 
one for me” he said after the 
game.
Tech Play Shines
Westminster, who had previous­
ly beaten such formidable small 
college opponents as Waynesburg 
and Grove City, a team that de­
molished Tech 62-0, and had lost 
only to powerful Slippery Rock 
20-13, was outplayed the entire 
game except for the last four min­
utes. Even then, without the aid 
of a doubtful call of roughing the 
kicker against Tech, the score 
would most probably have wound 
up 7-7.
Said the sports editor of the 
Westminster school paper before 
the game, “Your team won’t be 
able to run much today against 
our line.” The prediction proved 
to be somewhat correct, for the 
statistics show that Tech was able 
to muster only 95 yards on the 
ground. However, it was patently 
untrue in the case of Al Abels, 
5’ 7” 155 lb. junior, halfback, who 
was voted “Player of the Year” by | 
both coaches and players just j 
after the game, carried for 1051 
on 13 carries and caught the I 
hat tied the game at 7 all.
Game of Frustration
II was, as Coach Harold Burry j 
said. “A game of frustration” for j 
both teams. For the Titans two of 
Quarterback Ellis’ passes were in­
tercepted, and as a team, they lost; 
the ball twice on fumbles. How­
ever, they did make the most of j 
their .opportunities. .Only .three!
times in the ball game did West- i into Titan territory five times, and
minster penetrate the niidfield 
stripe into Tech territory, but they 
scored on two of tliese occasions.
For Tech, it was a different 
story. They were able to drive
within the Titan 15 yard line 
thrice, but they were only able to 
muster one touchdown from these 
opportunities. In addition, Tech 
was thrown for losses on 17 out of
their 53 offensive plays, most of 
the losses coming on attempted 
passes
Six Senior Co-Captains
A small crowd of less than a 
thousand was on hand for the 
kickoff. The six seniors on the 
Tech squad were all co-captains. 
Meeting the Westminster co-cap- 
tains at mid-field were Furman 
Smith, Larry Arendas, Andy Ste- 
fani, Ken Bechtel, Don Monti, and 
Jim Baker.
Bechtel kicked to Swift at the 
five who returned to his own 44. 
After two short probes into the 
line, Quarterback Ellis tried a 
draw play that misfired into a 
fumble, and an alert Tech line­
man fell on the ball. On the first 
play from scrimmage, Abels burst 
off tackle, got two excellent 
blocks, and went to the West- 
•minster 11 before being hauled 
down. The play was good for 40 
yards and a first down.
Tech then threw away its first 
scoring chance. Two running plays 
and an incomplete pass were for 
naught, and on fourth down, Ellis 
intercepted a pass deep in the end 
zone and ran it out to the 14 yard 
line.
Recover Another Fumble
Westminster then began its 
steady, punishing ground game 
for which they are known. Six 
plays took them to the 35, but on 
a dive play, halfback Swift 
fumbled the wet ball and big Don 
Monti recovered. The two fumble 
recoveries gave evidence that 
Tech was not the lethargic, inalert 
team that they had been on earlier 
occasions.
The Tartans took the ball and 
drove 28 yards in 5 plays, placing 
the ball on the Westminster 14. 
Then, the lost-yardage-on-at­
tempted pass misses, which was 
to pxague the loam the rest of the 
day, struck for the first time. 
Hechler was dropped trying to 
pass at the 21, Smith lost five 
yards on a completed swing pass, 
and the Titans took over on their 
own 26.
---------------------------------------------------
Again starting a power drive, 
designed to wear down the al­
ready pitifiully thin manpower of 
Tech, the Titans cruised to the 
Tech 43 before having to punt.
In the drive, Ellis overthrew 
Swift at the Tech 20 after Swift 
had beaten his Tech defender six 
ways from Sunday.
“Fair Catch”
With Merrill and Abels shar-^ 
ing the ball-toting load, Tech^- 
moved from their 35 to the Titan 
47, then they too were forced to 
punt. Hechler kicked to Swift 
standing on his, 11 yard line. With 
several Tech linemen bearing 
down on him, Swift gave what 
was later ruled as a fair catch 
sign. An oncharging defender 
didn’t comprehend that the weak 
wave of the hand was such a sign 
and brush-tackled the man with 
the ball. The officials promptly £
stepped off a fifteen yard penalty 
against Tech for the violation.
In truth, the penalty didn’t hurt, 
for three plays later, Tech re­
ceived the ball on their own 17 
after a Westminster quick kick. 
The strategy apparently was to
put Tech’s back to the wall and 
allow them to beat themselves by 
some mechanical error.
It didn’t pay off, and the teams
spent the rest of the first half, ^
some 5 minutes of it, trading the 
ball and gaining very little yard­
age. This in itself was an ex­
ample of the heads up football
that Tech was playing, for the
powerful Titans were utterly un­
able to generate any sort of an 
attack.
Following the Kiltie Band half- 
time show, the teams resumed the 
scoreless but exciting contest. The 
Tartans received the kickoff, fail- $ 
ed to move the ball, and Hechler 
punted dead on the Tech 47.
Westminster Scores 
Several plays put the ball on the 
25, where the drive seemed to bog 
down. Ellis threw thre> incom­
plete passes, then stepped back 
and fired a strike to Swift cut-

mg diagonally across the end 
zone to break the scoring ice. The 
extra point kick was good and 
the Titans led, 7-0.
Some feared that this would be 
the beginning of the rout but the 
Tartans roared back to life. On
tha first play from scrimmage fol­
lowing the kickoff, Abels duplicat­
ed his long first half gainer by 
squirting off tackle and fighting 
his way 43 yards to the West­
minster 32. Two more running 
plays took the ball to the 28, and 
then Hechler tried a jump pass, 
incomplete.
Abels Gets TD 
Coming- back with the same 
play, he hit Abels on the dead 
run at the 20, and Abels cut to 
his right and raced into the end 
zone for the TD. The extra point 
snap was high, but holder Fur­
man picked up the ball and just 
barely made it over the goal for 
the one point conversion.
The ensuing kickoff was taken 
by Swift and returned to the 
eight. On his third play, Ellis 
threw a weak pass intended for 
Swift that was intercepted by 
Kent Baldauf at the Titan 40.
Tech's offense suddenly fell 
apart, and they were forced to 
kick in four plays. Westminster 
was also having trouble in get- 
their drive in gear, and a 
series of punts resulted. Tech was 
able to move the ball for short 
on the ground, but when 
tried to take to the air, the 
passer was invariably snowed un­
der by a host of white-clad 
Titans.

A fine Terry Hechler kick plac­

Penalty Hurts 
What happened next was un­
doubtedly the turning point of 
the game. On a fourth down and 
long yardage situation, Westmin­
ster punted. Rushing hard, Larry 
Agendas appeared to reach for the 
ball, then rolled himself to the
side to avoid the punter’s body. At 
the same time, the kicker, after 
lofting the kick, threw himself 
over Arendas and landing quite 
hard on the ground.
Seeing the kicker down, an offi­
cial hastily called a roughing the 
kicker penalty, and marched off a 
15-yards. This placed the ball on 
the Tech 43, and from this point, 
a weary Tech defense was unable 
to stop the desperate drive of the 
Titans, who were fighting to re­
tain their self respect.
Titans Get Clincher 
It took them several plays to 
score, the clincher coming on an­
other Ellis to Swift pass. It was 
inconsequential that the extra 
point try failed. With 2:51 left on 
the clock, Tech could do nothing 
but try for the long pass. They 
weren’t even able to ge the pass 
off, and surrendered the ball at

Carnegie Tech Athletic Director 
Mel Cratsley announced the resig­
nation of Eddie Hirshberg as head 
football coach last Thursday. The 
resignation was effective follow­
ing the completion of the season 
last Saturday against Westminster.
Hirshberg has been at Carnegie 
Tech since 1949. From that time, 
until Dr. Eddie Beker’s death in 
1959, he was an asistant coach. 
He assumed his present position 
in 1960. Since that time, Carnegie 
Tech teams have won 5 and lost 
18.
In submitting his resignation, 
Hirshberg said, “It is my decision 
to retire from coaching at the end 
of this season. I have derived a 
great deal of satisfaction from 
my many years at Carnegie Tech, 
but increasing burdens being 
placed upon my time make it too 
difficult to continue. I shall al­
ways remember the many happy 
years I spent at Carnegie Tech, 
and I wish you and the team 
much success.”
A graduate of the University of 
Pittsburgh, Hirshberg was an end 
on the 1930 and 1931 Pitt teams, 
and captained the team in the lat­
ter year. Folowing graduation, 
he entered the coaching profes­
sion at little St. Thomas College, 
now Scranton, as an assistant 
coach. The next year, he re­
turned to Pitt and following four 
years in the staff of his alma ma-
High Hopes for Next Year
[continued from page 9] 
ing, the Titans tried to tack an­
other other score up, but failed. 
Not satisfied with their six point 
victory, the greedy ones called 
time out after each play to stop 
the clock and thus be able to run 
yet another play.
“Gave JSverytiilng”
After the game, a visibly disap­
pointed Coach Hirshberg had 
nothing but praise for his players. 
“They gave everything they had, 
but a couple mistakes were cru­
cial. Next Year, they’ll eliminate 
those mistakes.” Although it cost 
him the game, he wasn’t vindic­
tive about the roughing the kicker 
penalty called on the Tartans. “I 
think the call was bad,” he said, 
“but you can’t tell until you see 
the movies of the game.”
Only Six Graduate 
The outlook for next season is 
guardedly optimistic. Only six 
seniors will graduate, and a nuc- 
leas of underclassmen will be re­
turning who are capable of very 
good football on occasion. In addi­
tion, the hope was expressed by 
Athletic Director Cratsley that 
good players who are now in 
school but not out for football 
would see their way clear next 
year to participate. In addition, a 
strong group of freshmen would 
bolster the team a great deal.
The reaction of the players after 
the game was simply “It’s a tough 
one to lose. We really wanted to 
win this one.” No one can de// 
that they did their best.

ing discharge, joined Baker aiain 
on the coaching staff of the Mc­
Keesport Ironmen, a local inde­
pendent team which won 16 con­
secutive games over a period un­
der the guidance of Baker and 
Hirshberg. When Baker accepted 
the Carnegie Tech coaching posi­
tion in 1949, he brought Hirshberg 
with him.
In announcing the resignation, 
Mel Cratsley said, “Eddie has 
given Carnegie Tech fourteen 
years of loyal service and has un­
derstood and endorsed our ath­
letic policy by his unselfish serv­
ice. It is regrettable, but under­
standable, that his other commit­
ments are such that he no longer 
feels he can devote enough time 
to the job. We haven’t given any 
thought yet to a posible suc­
cessor.”

Hail to the champs. Alpha Tau 
Omega has won tfte coveted in­
tramural touch football trophy by 
defeating Phi Kappa Theta in the 
championship game, 22-15. The 
game was hard fought and well 
played by both sides but ATO 
proved that it was a champion­
ship team by breaking a 14-14 
tie in the final quarter on a touch­
down pass to Bob Roberts. Un­
like most intramural games, it 
was difficult to pick out individ­
ual stars since just about every 
player came up with a key play 
at one point or another.
ATO kicked off but the Phi 
Kaps were held to four downs 
and forced to punt. ATO’s offense 
got rolling in a hurry. Dave De- 
vas ran for a first down and then 
threw a pass to Chip McKnight 
who changed his direction and ran 
diagonally into the corner of the 
end zone for the score.
Following the kick-off, PKT 
got one first down on a long pass 
to Howie Pifer. But ATO held, 
took over, and rolled to another 
TD. Gearge Cearmella brought 
the ball to PKT’s ten on a long 
bomb form Devas. Then, Chip 
McKnight scored his second TD 
when he delayed two counts at 
the scrimmage line, took a pass 
across the middle form Devas, 
and ran the remaining five yards 
for the score.
But the Phi Kaps were far from 
dead. In a third and one situa­
tion, Bill Albright crossed up the 
ATO defense with a twenty-yard 
TD pass to Larry Lang. Then 
two plays later, Howie Pifer made 
a beautiful interception of a De­
vas pass to put the ball on ATO’s 
ten. Pifer then scored on a down 
and out pass from Albright.
ATO took the kickoff and 
looked like they were going to 
score again. Two pases to Gearge 
Ciarmella and one to Joe Sheld- 
rick brought two first downs and 
a first and goal situation on the 
one. On the next play however, 
Bill Albright intercepted a Dave 
Devas pass in the end zone to 
stop the threat. PKT’s final point 
of the half came on a wild play 
that included four desperation 
backfield laterals and a pass to 
Larry Lang for the necessary fif­
teen yards. This point brought 
the score to 14-12, ATO at the 
half.
As the third quarter began, the 
Phi Kaps looked like they were 
going to shoot right past ATO. 
A pass to Pifer brought them a 
first down, and then Larry Lang
alertly grabbed a long pass that 
had been deflected by ATO to 
give PKT a first and goal situa­
tion. But here ATO dug in. Ernie 
Partie, Chip McKnight, and Dave 
Grebas knocked down four con­
servative Bill Albright passes and 
ATO took over on downs. This 
goal line stand was the turning 
point in the game as it seemed to 
take the wind out of the Phi Kaps 
and give ATO thes park it needed 
to drive for the wining score.
Now from the four, Dave Devas 
passed to McKnight and Sheld- 
rick for two first downs. This 
set the stage for Devas’ winning 
down-and-out TD pass to Bob 
Roberts. This TD completely 
broke the back of the Phi Kaps 
who could only muster one more 
first down for the remainder of 
the game.
The big difference in the sec­
ond half was the spirited play of 
ATO’s defensive unit. They 
seemed to correct several first- 
half pass defense mistakes and 
several times caught Bill Albright 
in the backfield for big losses.
Second place in the playoffs
was decided by discussions rather 
than a game. The Grad Eagles 
and the Phi Kaps agreed to share 
second place honors.

Pagf 1% — CARNEGIE TARTAN — Wednesday. November 14. 1962
The Old Days Will Soon Come Back, 
Tech Intends To Win Next Season
Every Thistle contains many memories of Carnegie Tech. 
From our back files. Sports Editor Mike Campbell has select­
ed the four top football games played in the history of Car­
negie Tech. As the 1962 football season draws to a close, we 
of the Thistle feel that these classic games will enable you 
to look back into the heritage of Carnegie Tech.
“for the glory of Carnegie ...”
Tech 7—Notre Dame 0 *
Somewhat chastened bj their
rather poor showing the preced­
ing Saturday, Captain Stewart and 
his mates entered the third game 
of the season—Notre Dame—with 
a wealth of determination. The 
result is history! The famed 
Harpster surprise attack clicked 
in the first three plays of the 
game, when, on the third play, 
Bevevino passed to Lewis for a 
touchdown. Score: 7 to 0. From 
then on the Tartans sat back on 
the defensive and defied their ri­
vals to cross the goal
After Burzio recovered Notre 
Dame’s fumble on the kickoff and 
Lewis made his sensational dash 
for a touchdown, the Ramblers 
shot everything they had—all to 
no avail. At no time did the No­
tre Dame attack function effec­
tively. A great Carnegie line, led 
by Burzio, resisted all onslaughts 
and stopped plays before they 
were started. Don Elser, 215 
pound fullback, furnished the only 
Notre Dame threat; but he, too, 
was successfully squelched. Be­
sides furnishing the student body 
with its first football holiday in 
years, the victory put Carnegie 
into that select class of college 
teams that can boast three vic­
tories over the Irish. A great day 
for Tech, and a great day for 
Harpster.Tech 9—Notre Dame 7
Playing under blue skies and to 
a near-capacity crowd, the sur­
prising Tartans accomplished one 
of the major upsets of the foot­
ball season by downing the high­
ly favored Irish from South Bend, 
Indiana., by the score of 9-7.
“Jimmy” Kawchak, by inter­
cepting an Irish pass and run- 
nig it back to the 13 yard line 
before he was tackled, set the 
stage for the first score of the 
game. In two running plays Leo 
Napotnik plunged over for the 
touchdown but Condit failed to 
kick the extra point.
The Irish then scored and con­
verted to lead 7-6, but the Tech- 
ites were not to be denied. A 
stalwart Carnegie line repeatedly 
repulsed Notre Dame’s goal-line 
sweated blood and body. Just be- 
Coleman Kopcsak’s reliable toe 
which sent the pigskin between 
the uprights for a field goal in 
the final quarter that turned the 
tide in favor of the Tartans and 
brought them out on the long end 
of the score.Tech 20—Pitt 10
A large home-coming crowd 
was treated to one of the greatest 
spectacles in the history of Tar­
tan athletics when they witnessed 
the contest that gave a magnifi­
cent victory to a Carnegie Tech 
team that refused to be outplayed. 
Not only did the Tartans subdue 
the Panthers, but they came from 
behind to do it. When Stebbins 
ran the opening kickoff back for 
a touchdown, it looked like the 
same old story. But the Skibos 
had been pointing for the Pitt 
game for many weeks and were 
not the kind to be discouraged. 
With Condit and Muha, the twin 
halfbacks, carrying the burden 
of a smashing offensive, the Plaid 
tied the score up at 7-7. The ac­
tual touchdown came on a pass 
from Condit to Muha. Pitt re­
sorted to the same tactics they 
had used several times before— 
kicking a field goal. The Panthers 
drove the ball down into Skibo 
territory and when further ground 
or aerial gains seemed to go for 
naught, Daddio hoted the leather 
between the uprights and sent the 
across-Forbes boys into the lead, 
10-7. From here on in the Skibos 
sweated blood and body. Just be­
fore the end of the half, Ray Car- 
nelly faded back and tossed a pass 
to the outstretched and waiting 
arms of Karl Striegel in the end 
zone. It was a great day for the 
Tartans, leading at the half, 14- 
10. In the second half, all fears 
vanished as the Techites turned 
on the heat by scoring again, this 
time with Muha handling the pig­
skin. The Panthers were all at 
their wits end, and try as they 
may, they couldn’t edge out the 
Tartans.Tech 7—Texas Christian 15
Playing their first post season 
game at the Sugar Bowl, the Tar­
tans fought mightily but weren’t 
enough to stop the power of the 
Horned Frogs. In the second pe­
riod Connie Sparks drove the ball
across the line to give the South­
erners a 6-0 edge. Pete Moroz 
faded back later in the game and 
flipped a long one to Condit for 
a tally. Muha added the extra 
point and Carnegie Tech was lead­
ing at the half 7-6. In the mid­
dle of the third stanza the Tar­
tans got a convincing taste of 
Davey O’Brien’s deftness as the 
Mighty Mite flipped a touchdown 
pass to Horner and the Frogs led 
12-7. Tech tried hard to stop the 
passing of O’Brien but the little 
boy kept up his damage. The 
Frogs got down to the Tartan 
three yard line, where O’Brien 
botted a three-pointer to make 
the final score, 15-7, in favor of 
T.C.U.
Many honors were bestowed 
upon the members of the 1938 
team. Campbell, Carnelly, 
Schmidt, Condit, Muha, and Reith 
were named on various honorary 
teams. Lee, Campbell and Car­
nelly had been invited to play 
with the Eastern All-Stars in 
New York in August. Fisher 
was named as a coming great by 
the scribes.
