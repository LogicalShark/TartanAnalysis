Tepper Quad ?nally opens with pompIntersect@CMU:the inaugural event
GABRIEL BAMFORTH
Junior Staffwriter
A crowd of over 2,500 
people gathered on 
Thursday to celebrate the 
grand opening of the David 
A. Tepper Quadrangle. 
Beneath crimson Carnegie 
Mellon banners and streams 
of sunlight shining through 
the atrium’s vast glass ceil-
ing, onlookers watched as 
13 members of the commu-
nity stood, scissors in hand, 
waiting to cut the ribbon. 
This moment marked the 
of?cial end of three years 
of promotion, construction, 
and anticipation over the 
massive new addition to the 
Carnegie Mellon campus.
The 315,000 square 
foot, $201 million building 
is something of an archi-
tectural gem. Its exterior 
juts out over Forbes Avenue 
with angular swathes of 
bricks and glass, broken 
up by sharp off-axis rooms 
and outcroppings. The inte-
rior is contrastingly smooth, 
featuring rounded levels 
around the atrium and an 
arcing glass roof to provide 
natural lighting. Of the few 
rooms in the building that 
do not have a window, all of 
them have at least one glass 
wall.
Along with its aesthetics, 
the building boasts innova-
tive sustainability efforts. 
The abundant natural light 
reduces the amount of 
electricity consumed for 
lighting, and each level 
has a network of heating 
tubes running through the 
concrete ?oor decking to 
provide heating from the 
bottom up, making it easier 
to heat some of the build-
ing’s high ceilings. In addi-
tion to heating elements, the 
?oors also contain an inno-
vative technique known as 
Bubble Decking, which re-
duces the building’s carbon 
footprint by 30 percent by 
replacing super?uous con-
crete with recycled plastic 
balls. The building also con-
tains a 120,000-gallon cis-
tern that collects rainwater 
to be recycled for landscape 
irrigation and toilet ?ush-
ing. With these features and 
many more, the building 
seeks to earn a LEED Gold 
sustainability certi?cation.
The Tepper Quad—and 
the philosophy it repre-
sents—is the latest and 
most dramatic movement 
towards the “interconnect-
ed campus” model outlined 
in the Carnegie Mellon 
University Strategic Plan 
2025. For the ?ve speakers 
at the ribbon-cutting cer-
emony, one idea remained 
consistent: collaboration. 
In his address, university 
president Farnam Jahanian 
looked ahead, assuring his 
audience that the future of 
21st-century education “will 
depend on breaking down 
disciplinary silos.” Amidst 
applause he continued, “It 
will be forged by diverse 
minds coming together for 
learning and research.” 
Though Forbes Avenue 
separates it from the main 
campus, it is meant to be 
a hub for interdisciplinary 
work, a center of campus 
life, and what The Piper 
described as “CMU’s new 
front door to campus and 
its window to the world.”
The building is the home 
of the new Swartz Center 
for Entrepreneurship, a col-
lection of programs that 
provide support and educa-
tion for students, faculty, 
alumni, and staff to start 
their own businesses. The 
center offers coursework 
and degrees, networking 
events, incubators, cor-
porate partnerships, and 
funding opportunities for 
entrepreneurs. Jim Swartz, 
the center’s primary bene-
factor and namesake, has 
stressed that it’s not just 
about making Carnegie 
Mellon the “destination of 
choice” for people inter-
ested in entrepreneurship. 
“It’s about helping students 
learn a way of life that’s 
going to serve them well 
in the future,” he said in a 
video about the center.
The Tepper Quadrangle 
also houses 18 new break-
out spaces for students to 
work and have meetings, 
as well as the new 600-per-
son capacity Simmons Au-
ditorium. The new largest 
auditorium on campus, the 
Simmons Auditorium can 
also be divided into small-
er sections for classes and 
other programs. The Forbes 
Avenue entrance features 
an of?cial Carnegie Mellon 
University Welcome Center, 
where visitors can inquire 
about admissions and learn 
about the school through 
a number of interactive 
installations. “The idea,” 
said Tepper in his address, 
“is that we’ll have people 
commingle from all around 
campus to share ideas.”
Tepper received a 
Master of Science in 
Industrial Administration 
from Carnegie Mellon in 
1982, launching his career 
in capital investment 
and specialty trading. He 
started the hedge fund 
Appaloosa Management 
in 1993, which has seen 
a cumulative gain of over 
$25 billion. In 2003, he left 
his ?rst mark on Carnegie 
Mellon with a $55 million 
donation to the business 
school (to rename it after 
himself), and has since 
been involved in long-
term planning. This most 
recent $67 million invest-
ment in the Quadrangle, 
also named after him, re-
?ects his determination 
to enhance the business 
program at a school tra-
ditionally known for its 
engineering, computer sci-
ence, policy, and drama 
programs. The Tepper 
Quadrangle makes a bold 
statement of the Univer-
sity’s focus on and invest-
ment in the business pro-
gram. As the ribbons fell on 
the new atrium ?oor, they 
ushered in a new chapter in 
the Carnegie Mellon story, 
one centered on business 
education.

The ?rst Intersect@
CMU conference also had 
the honor of being the 
?rst big event held in the 
shiny new David A. Tepper 
Quadrangle. The intersec-
tion to which the name 
of the conference refers 
is presumably the same 
intersection that the still 
squeaky clean Tepper Quad 
represents: “the nexus of 
technology and business.”
The panelists attracted 
by the inaugural confer-
ence discussed topics that 
live at the ‘nexus’ President 
Farnam Jahanian touted, 
in all likelihood ones that 
will continue to be dis-
cussed in the Tepper Quad 
as students settle into the 
academic year. Though the 
topics were all technolo-
gy-in?uenced, the speak-
ers were largely business 
leaders or business profes-
sors with connections to 
Carnegie Mellon.
The ?rst panel, titled “At 
the Intersection of Technol-
ogy and Business: Smart 
Home, Smart Car, Smart 
City,” featured Anthony 
Foxx, who served as 
Secretary of Transportation 
under former President 
Barack Obama, who will 
begin this year as an 
‘executive-in-residence’ at 
Carnegie Mellon, providing 
Heinz College and College 
of Engineering students 
with his expertise on cit-
ies and transportation. 
The second panel, titled 
“Designing Intelligence: 
Shaping AI and Society,” 
featured Alexander Grey, 
VP of AI Sciences at IBM 
who graduated with a 
Ph.D. in computer science 
in 2003. The third and ?nal 
panel in the one day confer-
ence was “Decentralizing 
Trust: Blockchain’s Radical 
Potential,” which highlight-
ed current and future uses 
of blockchain.
Though the talks all 
discussed the uses of new 
technologies in the busi-
ness sector, the undercur-
rent that sometimes went 
unmentioned was the po-
tential dangers that these 
technologies represented 
when optimized for busi-
ness without considering 
social repercussions.
This trend was per-
haps best represented 
by the keynote speaker, 
Jerome Pesenti, VP of AI 
at Facebook who did re-
search in computer science 
at Carnegie Mellon while 
doing mandatory service 
in the French military. He 
began with the claim that 
“AI is at the core of what 
Facebook does, but it may 
not be evident.” AI and 
machine learning algo-
rithms determine most of 
a Facebook user’s experi-
ence, from ordering the 
news feed to serving the 
ads that are at the center of 
Facebook’s revenue model.
He insisted that the - was 
no longer trying to opti-
mize for maximum engage-
ment, but instead asked the 
questions “is it making you 
happy? Is it making you 
more informed?” Along 
this vein, he detailed the 
ways in which Facebook is 
using algorithms to recog-
nize meaningless clickbait 
or to crack down on hate 
speech. He acknowledged 
the limitations of relying on 
AI to do these things, refer-
ring to Facebook’s failure to 
remove posts inciting vio-
lence against the Rohingya 
Muslims in Myanmar in 
saying, “Trying to catch 
hate speech is very dif?cult. 
And doing that in Burmese 
is more dif?cult.”
Mourners ?ock to Mac Miller vigil
“Blue Slide Woodstock”
ALEX OH, JACOB PAUL
Staffwriters
A sea of people, mostly 
college students, engulfed 
the unassuming Blue Slide 
Park playground this past 
Tuesday, Sept. 11. As song 
after song rang through 
the park Mac Miller made 
famous, his fans celebrated 
the life of someone they 
considered an inspiration. 
Despite the jovial energy, 
the gloomy overcast weather 
that evening re?ected the 
sense of loss that hung thick 
in the air.
On Friday, Sept. 7, Mac 
Miller — Pittsburgh native 
and world famous rap art-
ist — was found dead in his 
Los Angeles home due to an 
apparent drug overdose. He 
was only 26 years old.
Mac Miller’s ?fth studio 
album, Swimming, was re-
leased on Aug. 3 to great 
acclaim from both fans and 
critics. On Oct. 27, he was 
set to go on tour, accompa-
nied by renowned bassist 
Thundercat and rap artist 
JID. The last tweet he sent 
reads “I just want to go on 
tour.”
Born Malcolm McCor-
mick, Miller was raised in the 
Point Breeze neighborhood 
of Pittsburgh, just a couple 
of miles from Carnegie Mel-
lon. He was Bar Mitzvahed 
at Rodef Shalom, a reform 
synagogue located on Fifth 
Avenue. At age 15, while at-
tending Taylor Allderdice 
High School, he recorded his 
?rst mixtape on his laptop.
At age 18, Miller signed 
to Rostrum Records 
and released KIDS, his 
breakthrough mix-tape. 
KIDS featured some of his 
fan’s favorite tracks to date. 
In 2010 he told the Pittsburgh 
Jewish Chronicle, “I wanted 
to create a voice for a genera-
tion of regular kids who can 
relate to this music, like a 
soundtrack to their lives.”
Mac Miller stood out 
because he rapped about his

STUDENT GOVERNMENT COLUMN
SHRAIY GUPTA
Special to The Tartan
Hello Students at 
Carnegie Mellon,
Today I want to take 
this opportunity to ad-
dress you directly. Or at 
least those of you who 
read The Tartan. I know 
many of you may brush 
this column off as incon-
sequential. But I want to 
explain to you why that 
is wrong. The Student 
Government here at 
Carnegie Mellon is try-
ing to make a real impact. 
Our current initiatives 
are focusing on moderat-
ing the add/drop dead-
line, providing cheaper 
apparel to students, and 
managing day to day 
items like the Dean’s Lists 
and finals schedule. If 
any of these issues are re-
motely important to you, 
then the Student Govern-
ment has a direct impact 
on your experience here 
at Carnegie Mellon. I’m 
not saying you must run 
for a position on Senate 
or the Executive Branch. 
I know everyone has 
their time commitment. 
But I strongly encourage 
you to reach out to the 
representatives in your 
college and let them know 
how your experience has 
been at Carnegie Mellon. 
If you feel like something 
needs to be changed, 
they are the ones who 
will help instigate that 
change. If you don’t know 
who your representatives 
are, please visit www.
cmusenate.org to view a 
list of senators by college. 
Everyone on the Sen-
ate is looking to make a 
positive and meaningful 
impact on campus, and 
we rely on student feed-
back to make that change 
happen. I look forward 
to hearing about all your 
suggestions about how 
to enhance the Carnegie 
Mellon experience.
Kind Regards,
Shraiy Gupta

At Carnegie Mellon 
University, school shuttles 
are an important if under-
utilized form of transporta-
tion for students, sometimes 
the only option besides 
public buses. Whether stu-
dents live outside of walk-
ing distance from campus 
or just need to take a quick 
trip to Whole Foods to stock 
up on groceries, shuttles 
ferry students from campus 
hotspots to central areas in 
Pittsburgh. However, stu-
dents do not always know 
much information about 
the exact location of shuttle 
stops or what time the shut-
tles arrive at a particular 
location.
To address this issue, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Parking 
and Transportation Depart-
ment has partnered with 
Ride Systems to develop 
a mobile phone app that 
can track school shuttles in 
real time, allowing students 
to know when and where 
they can ?nd these shuttles, 
and thus use them more 
ef?ciently.
Ride Systems is an 
organization whose main 
product is an app of the 
same name that, accord-
ing to its website, provides 
live maps of vehicle loca-
tions, estimated time of 
arrivals, settings to notify 
riders when a bus is close 
to arriving, ridership infor-
mation, and administrative 
maps that track informa-
tion about its own vehicles, 
among other services.
In an interview with The 
Tartan, Michael Rees, who 
works at Ride Systems, 
gave a sense of the scope 
of the app’s usage. “Ride 
Systems has been working 
with universities from our 
conception. Our ?rst client 
was Utah State [Univer-
sity] and they are still a cli-
ent to this day,” he said.
Ride Systems’ app is 
also used by a variety of 
organizations besides uni-
versities. Its other clients 
include airports, munici-
palities, private companies, 
hotels, and resorts.
Since the app has rolled 
out, its bene?ts are already 
being felt, including from 
the point of view of those 
in charge of the Carnegie 
Mellon shuttles on the 
administrative side.
Lieutenant Robert 
Opferman, who com-
mands the Special Services 
Division in the university’s 
police department, called 
the app “extremely help-
ful” in an interview with 
The Tartan. It is now more 
convenient and ef?cient for 
students to ride the shuttle, 
as they no longer have to 
stand outside for a long 
time waiting. In addition, 
through the noti?cations 
feature that the app pro-
vides, “[Carnegie Mellon] 
dispatchers are able to 
send pushes out to the 
ridership informing them 
about cancellations and 
delays”, Opferman said.
“Making the bus more 
convenient to ride is one of 
our main motivators”, said 
Rees. This convenience 
can now be enjoyed by 
Carnegie Mellon students 
who ride the school shuttle 
as well. Students who rely 
on the shuttles will not 
have to guess at the times 
of their arrival and per-
haps some students will 
be tempted by the added 
convenience to give the 
shuttles a try!

He ended his speech 
with a warning about the 
AI whose in?uence he 
had touted as central to 
Facebook’s business: “If 
you don’t pay attention you 
can reinforce the bias that 
already exists in society,” 
though he insisted that “not 
all bias is bad.”
Pesenti closed this 
re?ection not with a 
solution to the problem of 
algorithmic bias but with a 
plea for people to focus on 
diversifying the ?eld of AI. 
“The most important thing 
we can do to is bring people 
into the ?eld...who under-
stand these biases, who 
experience these biases.” 
This conclusion seemed to 
reinforce what seemed to 
be an underlying message 
to the conference: technol-
ogy has immense potential 
in the business sector, but 
the ?eld has yet to grow and 
change to meet current and 
future consequences of this 
potential.

PGH’s park vigil for Mac Miller
MILLER , from A1
personal journeys with love, 
struggles with depression, 
and dreams of success. He 
had the braggadocious 
delivery one might ex-
pect of a rapper, but kept it 
authentic and sometimes 
even profound. On “Under 
the Weather”, a standout 
track from his ?rst studio al-
bum, Blue Slide Park, Miller 
raps “You can have the world 
in the palm of your hands 
but it don’t mean a thing till 
you change it.”
“His music meant a 
whole lot to me and helped 
me through some really dark 
times in my life,” said one 
fan who spoke at the vigil, 
a sentiment undoubtedly 
shared by many others. Jon 
Hewson, another vigil at-
tendee attested that he  felt 
”like [Miller] was really 
honest in his music, I feel like 
he really understood me.”
Mac Miller remains one 
of Pittsburgh’s most iconic 
artists. The pride he had for 
his hometown was evident 
in his 2011 album, Blue Slide 
Park, named after the park 
Miller grew up at. It was the 
?rst independently released 
album to top the charts in 
16 years, selling 145,000 
copies were sold in the ?rst 
week. Songs like “Party on 
Fifth Ave” also referenced 
Pittsburgh, and the music 
video for the album’s single 
“Frick Park Market” has over 
38 million views.
Lucas Ochoa, a senior 
in Human-Computer 
Interaction and Design at 
Carnegie Mellon who also 
attended the vigil voiced 
that “[Miller] sung about 
Pittsburgh in a way that 
made me really proud to 
have grown up here.”
A plethora of artists and 
musicians expressed their 
grief and shock on Twitter. 
The Internet, who backed 
Miller on a 2013 tour, along 
with Chance the Rapper, 
Earl Sweatshirt, Vince 
Staples, and Action Bronson, 
tweeted that “Mac treated 
everyone like we were head-
liners.”
Miller struggled with 
drug abuse for a long time, 
and made mention of it in his 
music. “Don’t tell my mom-
ma got a drug problem,” 
he casually raps on “Polo 
Jeans,” a standout track on 
his 2014 mix-tape, Faces.
“Malcolm had been so far 
up and then down the other 
side and up again,” wrote 
George Lange, a Pittsburgh 
native and longtime friend of 
Miller’s family. “I am just in-
credibly sad about Malcolm. 
He was so...so close to his 
greatest moment — and in 
one fragile step was gone.”
Organized by Pittsburgh 
music label, Nightfall 
Records, the vigil for the 
beloved rapper received help 
from food vendors and the 
police department. An esti-
mated 2,000 people gath-
ered at the Blue Slide Park 
vigil on Tuesday, according 
to Commander Herman 
of the Pittsburgh Police 
Department who described 
this event as “The Blue Slide 
Woodstock.”
The park felt alive with 
love and appreciation as 
people honored Miller in 
different ways. In one sec-
tion of the park, there was a 
live spray painting of a black 
and white mural of the rap-
per donning a gold halo. In 
another, a petition signing to 
rename a section of the park 
“Mac Miller Blue Slide Park.” 
Most notable was the throng 
of people surrounding the 
famous sloping blue slide, 
which had been repainted 
that day in preparation for 
the vigil.
As night fell, the music 
from the speakers and the 
murmurs from the crowd 
died down. The dark sky 
grew brighter as people be-
gan lighting their candles 
and raising them in the 
air. Emotions ran high as 
the night concluded with a 
moment of silence for the 
deceased Pittsburgh rapper.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Trump suggests compromising First AmendmentTennis world shows the reach of sexismPresident Donald Trump has 
not been the greatest supporter of 
the First Amendment. While run-
ning for president, he expressed 
interest in ‘opening’ up libel laws 
once he gained the presidency 
so that he “can sue [writers 
and sources of ‘fake news’] and 
win money instead of having 
no chance of winning because 
they’re totally protected.” A mere 
month into his presidency, he 
threatened the Johnson Amend-
ment, which would have taken a 
massive stab at the separation of 
church and state. He has had a 
history of demonizing the press 
as the “enemy of the people” and 
barred journalists from events 
such as White House brie?ngs. Af-
ter the North Korea-US Summit, 
Trump expressed that he wanted 
his people to treat him as North 
Koreans treat Kim Jong Un.
Considering the fact that he 
is a man who is praised by his 
supporters for “speaking his 
mind,” he doesn’t appear to want 
to enforce that same right for the 
people he should represent.
In response to the protests 
against Supreme Court nominee 
Brett Kavanaugh, Trump said “I 
don’t know why they don’t take 
care of a situation like that. I think 
it’s embarrassing for the coun-
try to allow protesters. You don’t 
even know what side the protest-
ers are on.”
He appeared to reminisce, say-
ing that “in the old days, we used 
to throw them out. Today, I guess 
they just keep screaming.”
Frankly, the topic of protest 
should not even matter. It is 
disgraceful that people, regardless 
of their stance on Trump, the 
current administration, and Judge 
Kavanaugh, are not taking strides 
to defend democracy and one of the 
major pegs that maintains it: the 
freedom of speech.
It is disappointing to see the 
audience that usually screams 
“freedom of speech!” and “First 
Amendment” in times such as the 
controversial Oregon bakery case, 
which deemed the baker’s wish to 
discriminate against a gay couple’s 
request for a wedding cake because 
of his personal religious beliefs, 
seems to be ominously silent when 
our president is trying to chip away 
at the fundamental tenet that allows 
democracy.
The First Amendment does not 
care what your opinion of Trump as 
a president is or whether you believe 
private businesses have the right to 
decide who to serve. Its duty is to 
make sure that your voice, if you 
want it to be heard, can be expressed 
without persecution.
Former President Barack Obama 
has had his fair share of criticisms 
before, during, and after his two 
terms as President of the United 
States. However, as he pointed 
out recently in his speech at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana 
Champaign, “I complained plenty 
about Fox News, but I never 
threatened to shut them down.” 
It’s quite a contrast to the countless 
tweets Trump made at “fake news” 
sources and anyone who doesn’t 
portray him in the most favorable 
angle.
Is Trump sending empty threats 
to create a stir? Quite possibly; if 
anybody knows how to use the 
sleight of hand to distract the 
masses, it’s Trump. Even if he 
doesn’t completely deny people the 
right to protest, he is still creating 
obstructions that discourage and 
inhibit people from doing so and 
potentially creating antecedents 
to ideologies that may later enable 
censorship.
In the Declaration of 
Independence, “Freedom of Speech” 
does not have an asterisk that leads 
to a microscopic footnote at the end 
reading “Terms and conditions may 
apply”. Freedom of speech does not 
protect just popular speech; it allows 
all of us to have a voice without 
the fear of persecution. It allows 
Colin Kaepernick, as well as other 
National Football League players, to 
take a knee for the national anthem. 
It allows people to  demonstrate 
their dissent towards the current 
administration. Are some protests 
more effective than others? Of 
course. However, we should not 
demonize the mere act of protesting.

“I don’t cheat to win” Serena 
declared, her voice shaking with 
impotent anger and frustration, 
as she challenged umpire Carlos 
Ramos’s call that she had received 
coaching during her US Open 
Final match against 20-year-old 
Naomi Osaka.
And in that moment, 
the fact that she has been 
repeatedly discriminated by the 
administration of the game that 
she now dominates like nobody 
ever did before ?ashed by my 
mind: she had been drug-tested 
more times than any other player 
has. She has had her femininity 
questioned. The catsuit she wore 
during French Open for medical 
purposes was banned… the 
list just goes on. So yes, at that 
moment, as she faced off with the 
umpire, I remembered all of this.
For those of you who don’t 
know what went down in that 
fateful ?nal, here’s the backstory: 
in the second game of the second 
set, Ramos gave Serena a code 
violation for receiving coaching. 
However, several other players 
receive on-court coaching and 
get away with it. In fact, the 
perennial bad boy of tennis, Nick 
Kyrgios, was “encouraged” by 
umpire Mohamed Lahyani, who 
was of?ciating his second round 
match at the same tournament 
during the changeover. 
Regardless, receiving coaching is 
still a violation of the rules, and 
Ramos was right in calling it out.
The tricky part is, Serena had 
apparently not seen her coach give 
her hand-signals, and took Carlos’ 
call as an attack of the integrity 
of her character. She demanded 
that he apologize for insinuating 
that she cheated because it was 
her coach that tried coaching her 
on-court and she had nothing to 
do with it.
Thereon, it went downhill.
He handed her a point penalty 
for breaking her racket, which 
was, again, a valid call. But then, 
Ramos decided that when Serena 
called him a “thief” for taking a 
point away from her, it quali?ed 
for verbal abuse. Since that was 
her third violation, it cost her a 
whole game in the ?nal set in a 
important crucial stage of the 
match.
Serena was penalized for 
displaying her anger, something 
that almost every sports-person 
does. She was penalized even 
though several other men had 
gotten away with saying the 
same, and sometimes even worse, 
to umpires. In fact, at one point 
in the fourth round of the French 
Open in 2017, Novak Djokovic 
faced off with Ramos himself, 
heatedly telling the umpire, 
“You’re losing your mind.” And 
all he got was a warning, not a 
penalty. Furthermore, that was 
in the fourth round of a Grand 
Slam tournament. In a Grand 
Slam ?nal, the stakes are higher 
and the emotions more volatile. 
Ramos had the authority and the 
power to bring the game back into 
control. But he didn’t.
In the same tournament, there 
was another display of sexism. 
French tennis player Alize Cornet 
realized that she had worn her 
shirt backwards and changed 
it, but umpire Christian Rask 
was given a violation. However, 
several other male tennis players 
often take off their shirts on-court 
and are never punished for it.
I’m not saying that he’s wrong 
to enforce rules; that is the 
umpire’s duty. I’m saying it is 
wrong that Ramos, and several 
other umpires, enforce rules 
selectively.
Worse are the reactions of 
some people online and the 
headlines in news reports that 
tagged Serena’s anger as a 
“meltdown.” Some ponti?cated 
that her behavior is a bad example 
to her daughter. One news article 
called her “unhinged” and termed 
her aggressiveness as “boorish” 
and a disappointing example to all 
those who considered her a role-
model.
But never were some 
prominent male tennis players 
such as John McEnroe, who was 
known for his temper on-court, 
or Djokovic, who is funny and 
easy-going until he gets furious, 
asked to control their anger on 
court because they’re role-models 
to many others. Never did sports 
writers question the kind of 
example they’re setting to their 
children through their display of 
anger.
When men do it, it’s passion. 
When women do it, it’s hysteria.
Several women are speaking 
out about their own experiences 
of workplace discrimination 
based on their gender and race. As  
former professional tennis player 
and advocate Billie Jean King said, 
women are taught to be perfect. 
We are taught to be ladylike, to 
adhere to society’s rigid rules, and 
to not show any emotions publicly 
even when the situation or our 
profession demand it. Instead, we 
are taught to just take it and move 
on. Why? Because speaking up 
results in backlash.
And that is what is happening 
to Serena now.
Serena has rede?ned the 
limits of what women can achieve 
in tennis. Yet there are people 
who constantly regard her 
achievements with skepticism 
and who question the legitimacy 
of her success with sometimes 
subtle, but more often blatant, 
racist and sexist remarks. She is 
the greatest female tennis player 
of all time, but she still has to ?ght 
for respect.
This is a woman who won her 
record-creating 23rd Grand Slam 
whilst she was pregnant. This is a 
woman who had to hear a former 
male Grand Slam champion mock 
her unborn child’s skin color. 
This is a woman who, a year ago, 
literally, had almost died after 
giving birth to her daughter, 
and then staged a triumphant 
comeback. This is a woman who’s 
been body-shamed too many 
times to count.
Women in tennis have faced 
discrimination. It was only in 1973 
that women started receiving 
equal prize money for winning 
Grand Slams. In fact, Wimbledon 
started giving equal prize money 
only a decade ago. Billie Jean King 
faced sexism and so has Serena. 
Sexism exists. And rather than 
denying it, tennis associations 
should ?nd ways to eliminate it.
That Saturday night, under 
the closed roof of the Arthur 
Ashe stadium, we did not see a 
“meltdown”. Instead, what we 
witnessed was the greatest female 
tennis player having  had enough 
of being disrespected.
Protestors, many who are women in black veils, gather to stop Brett Kavanaugh from being sworn in as Associate Justice.

Musk and the evolving role of the CEO
Party af?liation, once again, trumps ethics
FRANK HU
Junior Staffwriter
Cyborgs, the Singularity, the 
end of the universe, and everything 
in between—Elon Musk’s two-
and-a-half-hour interview with 
comedian Joe Rogan on The 
Rogan Experience was a stream 
of consciousness that left no stone 
unturned, eased along by a few 
glasses of whiskey and a few drags 
of pot.
Unsurprisingly, Musk’s 
performance came under ?re, 
and to make the situation even 
more dramatic, two of Tesla’s 
top executives left the company 
while the stock price tumbled by 
six percent, as reported by NPR. 
Needless to say, the public reaction 
wasn’t a positive one.
But intentionally or not, Musk 
has the right idea despite poor 
execution.
By no means am I condoning 
recreational marijuana or saying 
that Musk is setting a good example. 
Rather, what I am encouraging is 
for CEOs to become more public 
in their capacity as in?uencers and 
leaders, and Musk is clearly no 
stranger to media attention.
In case you haven’t noticed, 
the world has changed in the 
past 40 years: the economy has 
become more service based, 
internet and social media have 
closed geographic and cultural 
boundaries, and millennials are 
gradually overtaking baby boomers 
and Gen Xers. As our society 
changes, so too do the companies 
we support; after all, what kind of 
business wouldn’t keep pace with 
their consumer base?
Successful companies are 
adaptive ones; they are always 
reframing their brands through the 
values of their intended audience, 
and no one embodies that brand 
better than the CEO. Take Apple 
for example: sure, part of Apple’s 
success is the aesthetic and novel 
design of their products, but equally 
important was Steve Jobs’ charisma 
and image as a brilliant visionary 
who championed creativity 
and innovation, someone that 
consumers felt was inspirational 
and — more importantly — relatable.
Now, is smoking marijuana and 
rambling on a podcast inspiration-
al? Probably not. Is Musk trying 
to appeal solely to young stoners? 
Also no. But what Musk has done is 
inadvertently show us his human-
ity. At the end of the day, he enjoys 
a stiff drink and a random conver-
sation just as much as the next per-
son. Though that may seem trivial, 
for someone as rari?ed as Musk, it’s 
signi?cant. If consumers can iden-
tify with a CEO, then it’s a lot easier 
to identify with their brand, and 
that just means greater sales and 
pro?ts for the company.
Interviews aren’t the only 
platform for CEOs to publicize 
themselves. Nowadays, Twitter, 
Instagram, and Facebook are all 
excellent ways to connect with the 
masses, and it’s evident that public 
?gures are leveraging the power 
of social media to their bene?t. 
Despite the risks of being embroiled 
in controversies or scandals that 
can threaten public relations, it’s 
imperative now, more than ever, 
to maintain a positive, popular 
image that strikes a chord with 
potential buyers. CEOs who haven’t 
mastered this either fail to curry 
favor with their audiences or, worse 
yet, become memes on the Internet 
(looking at you, Zuckerberg).
Even if increased publicity 
doesn’t bene?t the company, it still 
serves the public interest by holding 
these individuals accountable for 
their actions. CEO outreach, in 
conjunction with news coverage, 
usually paints an accurate picture 
of the trajectory and the status of a 
business venture. This is especially 
important when you consider the 
fact that a lot of these companies 
— Tesla, Facebook, Apple — trade 
stocks that people have invested 
their hard-earned money in. These 
literal stakeholders depend on the 
ef?cient management of a company 
to turn a pro?t, and so transparency 
is an absolute necessity.
So, as eccentric and controversial 
as Musk may be, his recent stunt 
is emblematic of the digital age, 
where constant communication 
and public appearances by 
executives is normal and even 
expected. Gone are the days when 
corporate leaders were nothing 
more than obscure names and 
faces on company websites. CEOs 
are becoming increasingly vocal, 
strengthening their presence in our 
daily lives and acting, in part, as the 
conduits of our consumer culture. 
If that worries you, it shouldn’t; 
it’s only natural, and it shows that 
now, more than ever, our values 
are being observed and considered. 
With this increasing symbiosis 
between company leadership 
and its respective consumer base, 
businesses are getting better 
at delivering the services and 
products we want.
In the end, the customer is king. 
Just as they should be.

The quest for a replacement 
Associate Justice on the Supreme 
Court continues. After former 
Justice Anthony Kennedy began 
his retirement over the past 
summer, many people feared for 
the future of democracy and for 
policies regarding topics such 
as reproductive rights, freedom 
of speech, LGBTQ+ rights, and 
capital punishment. He was the 
vote that swung the ultimate 
decision in many cases over 
the past few decades. Given 
President Trump's history of 
picks for of?cials in Washington, 
many were not expecting the 
best.
Brett Kavanaugh, an 
American judge and President 
Donald Trump's pick for the 
Associate Justice of the Supreme 
Court of the United States, 
recently faced hearings before 
he could of?cially ?ll in the 
Supreme Court. Even before 
the hearings, many voices from 
the left tried to stop Kavanaugh, 
and understandably so. Before 
being elected president, Trump 
claimed he would cut back on 
abortion, claiming "[we should] 
be appointing pro-life judges." 
Kavanaugh recently hit the nail 
on the cof?n when he called 
birth control "abortion-inducing 
drugs". Kavanaugh was similarly 
dodgy in response to other topics 
such as LGBTQ+ rights, sexual 
harassment, and executive 
power.
It's unnerving when 
uneducated voices hold strong 
opinions based on inaccuracies 
and falsehoods (just log on to 
any political Twitter thread and 
read the tweets below it); it's 
another thing to see those voices 
having an impact on policies 
that affect thousands of lives.
Even if you give Kavanaugh 
the bene?t of the doubt by 
saying that his con?ation of 
birth control with abortions 
was an accident, he is still a 
questionable pick. Throughout 
the hearings, he had been caught 
lying under oath on multiple 
occasions.
The anonymous writer 
of a Slate article claimed to 
have made "some of the stolen 
memos that Brett Kavanaugh 
lied to the Senate about." In 
the early 2000s, Kavanaugh 
"received con?dential memos, 
letters, and talking points of 
Democratic staffers stolen 
by GOP Senate aide Manuel 
Miranda." Although receiving 
them is not an impeachable 
offense, lying under oath is. The 
Slate article shows Kavanaugh's 
history of lying about receiving 
the memos. More recently, Sen. 
Patrick Leahy, during the current 
hearing, brought up previously 
hidden emails where Miranda 
had asked to see Kavanaugh 
in person to "give him 'paper' 
?les with 'useful info to map 
out [Senators Joe] Biden and 
[Dianne] Feinstein, and others.'" 
When confronted, Kavanaugh 
claimed that he did not know 
that the information provided 
was done inappropriately 
and tried to justify himself 
by claiming it is "common to 
prepare nominees with material 
they believed would be asked... 
That is the coin of the realm." 
All politicians eventually lie or 
give misleading information for 
political gain, but the notable 
distinction here is that all of 
this happened while Kavanaugh 
was under oath. Perjury 
should immediately disqualify 
a candidate, but the hearings 
continued nevertheless.
Kavanaugh highlights a trend 
that has been continuing in our 
country: identity politics. It's 
not new that politicians shift 
their behavior or platform to 
gain power, but the seemingly 
tribalistic view on political 
parties has de?nitely been 
enhanced over the years. 
Kennedy, although conservative, 
valued ideals over his political 
party. This did follow with 
its fair share of criticism, but 
his vote — which contrasted 
the interests of the party he 
represented — ultimately swung 
in favor of reproductive rights. 
Even if it was a slap in the face 
for his party, Kennedy realized 
that what was more valuable 
than any party was the nation 
that he ultimately represents. 
Was the Supreme Court perfect 
with Kennedy? Of course not. 
However, we lost a bipartisan 
voice in the Supreme Court 
who prioritized the future of 
his country over the future of 
his party. Now eyeing his vacant 
seat, we ?nd a man who is a 
puppet for a party.
Furthermore, regarding 
Kavanaugh's hearings, I have 
one question: where are 
the chants from the people 
who shouted "lock her up" in 
response to then-Presidential 
candidate Hillary Clinton and 
her email scandal? Clinton 
deserved to face consequences 
for putting national security 
at stake and for not treating 
con?dential information 
properly. However, those who 
chanted "lock her up" appear 
silent on Kavanaugh. Why does 
one party's wrongdoing count 
whereas another party — one 
that just so happens to align 
with one's political views — can 
release a representative and not 
face consequences?
The question above is 
hypothetical; this, too, is greatly 
because of identity politics 
and its divisive nature. One's 
respective party is put on a moral 
pedestal whereas the other is 
berated. This has been evident 
in our current President's 
mentality; despite allegations 
of then-Senate candidate Roy 
Moore, Trump had no problem 
endorsing Moore because of his 
party af?liation. Many people 
who supported Trump did so 
because they prioritized party 
over ideals. Statements such 
as "I'd rather be Russian than 
a Democrat" puts committing 
treason above being af?liated 
with a different party.
The left is not exempt 
from this phenomena either. 
Former presidential candidate 
Hillary Clinton attempted to 
degrade those who planned 
on using their votes for her 
opposing candidate as a "basket 
of deplorables", disregarding 
her own shortcomings as a 
candidate. Some progressives 
blasted former President Barack 
Obama after he criticized 
identity politics by claiming 
people on all ends of the political 
spectrum cannot "out of hand 
disregard what your opponents 
have to say from the start...
[and] insist that those who 
aren't like you — because they 
are white, or because they are 
male — that somehow there’s no 
way they can understand what 
I'm feeling, that somehow they 
lack standing to speak on certain 
matters."
Politics has never been a 
clean topic; there is a good 
reason we avoid politics in many 
occasions. However, it is perhaps 
now more imperative than ever 
to be vigilant of our dialogue, 
our mindset, and the future for 
our democracy. Kavanaugh is a 
symptom, not the problem, of 
our current political climate. So 
is Trump and the swamp that he 
promised to drain but is instead 
manifesting. Regardless of 
political af?liation, we must hold 
our representatives, our leaders, 
and each other accountable.

Like at most schools, traditional 
college lecturing is a widely-used 
teaching method at Carnegie 
Mellon University. I’ve personally 
taken many courses here where all 
or most of the in-class time is spent 
listening to the professor lecturing. 
This has been true across a range 
of subjects, from environmental 
history to multivariable calculus.
While I have had the privilege of 
listening to a few great lecturers, I 
am often bored by sitting passively 
in class while the instructor drones 
on about a topic. It is dif?cult 
to focus, I’m not engaged, and 
while this, fortunately, has not 
yet happened to me, I’ve seen 
students fall asleep in lectures on 
many occasions. Sadly, even when 
a lecturer is well-prepared and 
has clearly put effort into their 
PowerPoint slides, I often don’t 
enjoy lectures.
You might think that the 
boredom that often accompanies 
listening to lectures is a necessary 
price to pay in order to learn the 
subject material well, but this is 
not the case. In fact, evidence from 
education research including meta-
analyses has shown that lecturing 
is a less effective teaching method 
than more active approaches to 
education. This is especially true for 
education in science, technology, 
engineering, and math (STEM) 
?elds.
So why is lecturing so wide-
spread, given its unpleasantness 
for students and the mountain of 
evidence against it? I can think of a 
number of reasons.
Professors are incentivized 
to focus more on research than 
teaching, and therefore they might 
not give much thought to the 
effectiveness of their pedagogical 
methods. It may appear that 
students are learning things 
in lectures, but they are really 
learning from the homework and 
other active learning components 
of the courses, not from the 
lectures. There could be a bias 
toward the status quo, or toward 
how things were when professors 
were students, or toward what the 
professor in the classroom next 
door is doing, or toward what our 
peer institutions are doing. As 
bad as lecturing is, the people in 
charge of university accreditation 
evidently don’t seem to mind.
Lecturing feels good for the 
lecturer, and people might even be 
interested in becoming a professor 
in part because they want to lecture. 
After all, it’s how most professors 
teach. On the student side, while 
listening to lectures may be boring, 
it is relatively easy and takes little 
effort. Students may feel like they 
are learning a lot from lectures, 
even if they won’t remember the 
content for long. And lectures can 
occasionally be quite entertaining 
or even inspiring, despite them not 
being good for learning.
Regardless of the reason for 
its persistence, lecturing needs to 
be replaced with better teaching 
methods. But how can this change 
come about? Since the primary 
way that students communicate 
feedback about their educational 
experiences at Carnegie Mellon is 
through the Faculty/Course Evalu-
ations (FCEs), I propose using this 
medium to ask for more active 
learning.
For the past few semesters, I 
have primarily based my ratings 
on the extent to which the courses 
I took did not consist of traditional 
lectures. Professors who lecture get 
1 or 2 stars, those who use class 
discussions or other active learn-
ing approaches get 4 or 5 stars, and 
those who use a mix of both get 
somewhere in between.
In addition, I have made sure to 
mention my opinion on lecturing 
vs. active learning in the comments 
section of the evaluations, citing 
my desire for more enjoyable, 
effective, and evidence-based 
teaching methods to be employed 
in the classroom. A few professors 
admirably request that students ?ll 
out mid-semester feedback forms, 
and I’ve used those to advocate for 
ending lectures as well.
Some Carnegie Mellon classes, 
both in the humanities and in 
STEM subjects, fortunately use 
active learning to great success. 
For example, last year I took 
International Development: Theory 
& Praxis, taught by former Carnegie 
Mellon post-doctoral fellow Dr. 
Takiyah Harper-Shipman. It was 
one of the most transformative 
and fascinating classes I’ve taken in 
college. It featured little lecturing 
and a lot of active discussion, class 
participation, and debate about the 
readings assigned for homework. 
It is a model of how reading-based 
courses should use in-class time.
I’m currently taking Statistical 
Computing with Professor Ryan 
Tibshirani. He devotes two out of 
three classes per week to hands-
on R programming labs. The 
instructor and teaching assistants 
walk around the classroom while 
students actively work on the 
assignments, offering assistance 
when students are struggling 
in an unproductive way. Aside 
from the Monday lectures, the 
Wednesday and Friday labs are 
a good approach that can be 
imitated by any of the numerous 
Carnegie Mellon courses in 
which students need to work on 
STEM problem sets.
There should be far more 
active learning at Carnegie 
Mellon, and far less lecturing. 
And if many students express our 
desire for this in FCEs, maybe 
there will be.

From Bigfoot to King 
Kong, people have been 
faking photographs and 
videos for as long as the 
media has existed.
With advances in arti-
?cial intelligence and ma-
chine learning, creating 
fakes has become much 
easier in recent years. Re-
searchers in the Robotics 
Institute here at Carnegie 
Mellon have developed a 
new algorithm to “retar-
get” videos: that is, they 
can take the content from 
one video and apply the 
style of another.
The team approached 
this problem using a class 
of algorithms called gener-
ative adversarial networks 
(GANs). This is an unsu-
pervised method, which 
means that the computer 
can do it without human 
intervention. Classic GANs 
consist of two “compet-
ing” systems: one to gen-
erate an image, and one to 
classify it as real or fake, 
called the discriminator. 
The goal of the generator 
is to fool the discriminator; 
the information from the 
discriminator then feeds 
back into the generator, 
helping it make better and 
better fakes.
This study, however, 
added another dimension 
to the algorithm. While 
previously only spatial 
information was used, in 
this work the researchers 
combined both spatial 
and temporal information. 
Their new algorithm, 
which they call 
Recycle-GAN, 
makes the 
new videos 
smoother 
and more 
believable.
One 
inspiration 
for the 
work is the 
?lm industry. 
“I think there 
are a lot of stories 
to be told,” said 
Aayush Bansal, a Ph.D. 
student and the study’s 
lead author.
Video retargeting 
has the potential 
to drastically 
reduce the cost 
of creating 
special 
effects in 
movies. It 
could be 
used to 
convert 
black-and-
white ?lms 
to color. 
It can also 
be applied 
to self-driving 
cars. The 
cars’ computers 
need to be trained 
to recognize their 
surroundings using 
labeled videos. While 
footage from well-lit 
scenes is easy to label, 
labeling videos of stormy 
or dark scenes is dif?cult. 
Recycle-GAN, however, 
can retarget these easily 
labeled 
fair-weather 
daytime scenes into 
nighttime scenes or 
storms, making it a useful 
training tool for dif?cult 
driving conditions.
You can ?nd videos 
demonstrating the 
effectiveness of their 
technique on their paper’s 
webpage. They each show 
side-by-side videos of the 
original and the results. 
In the ?rst, a clip of John 
Oliver is retargeted to the 
style of Stephen Colbert. 
The original video of Oliver 
is next to that of Colbert— 
their lips moving, heads 
bobbing, eyes blinking, and 
even hands gesturing at 
the same time. They have 
also applied their method 
to ?owers blooming, 
clouds moving across the 
sky, and origami birds, in 
addition to celebrities and 
politicians.
Of course, in the era of 
fake news, this technol-
ogy has led to concern over 
what are called deep fakes: 
altered videos that make 
people appear to do or say 
things that never actually 
happened.
The controversy be-
gan when videos con-
taining celebrities’ 
faces superimposed 
onto those of actors in 
pornographic movies 
appeared online. Now, 
the fake videos are also 
becoming a concern for 
politicians. 
On Sept. 13, three mem-
bers of Congress wrote a 
letter to the Director of 
National Intelligence, ask-
ing him to look into the 
threats of deep fakes to 
national security. Citing 
concerns for blackmail 
and meddling in elections, 
the letter states that deep 
fakes could be “used by 
foreign or domestic actors 
to spread misinformation.” 
Videos like this can 
already be found online. 
Buzzfeed, along with 
comedian Jordan Peele, 
created a fake video 
of President Obama 
as a public service 
announcement of the 
dangers of deep fakes. 
The video, which includes 
Obama calling President 
Trump a “dipshit,” 
encourages vigilance 
when considering the 
authenticity of content 
from the internet.
Some fear that the re-
verse is also possible — 
public ?gures might deny 
doing or saying things 
caught on video, claiming 
those videos are fake.
These issues have 
created a counter-?eld: a 
community of people, such 
as academics, national 
intelligence agencies and 
news organizations, who 
are working to differentiate 
between real videos and 
fakes. 
Some predict the 
beginning of an arms race, 
as both these ?elds become 
more sophisticated. While 
currently the average 
viewer can tell that the 
videos are a little “off,” 
the technology will only 
improve with time, making 
fake videos more and more 
realistic.
If you are ever in doubt 
about the authenticity of a 
video you come across on-
line, remember: you prob-
ably won’t catch the real 
Obama saying “stay woke 
bitches” anytime soon.

Researchers take deep fakes to the next level with GAN
Google launches a search engine for open datasets
ASHWIN SRINIVASAN
Junior Staffwriter
Finding large, high-
quality datasets has long 
been a daunting task for 
scientists, researchers, 
and journalists. On Sept. 
5, internet search giant 
Google launched a public 
beta version of their solu-
tion, a specialized search 
tool called Dataset Search. 
The tool allows users 
to locate open databases 
and ?les matching their 
keywords tagged with ap-
propriate metadata.
Although public data 
has become increasingly 
available since the rapid 
growth of the internet, 
large databases are often 
scattered throughout 
various organizations’ 
websites. 
In addition, catalogs of 
datasets are often grouped 
by topic, making it dif-
?cult for researchers to 
obtain data not directly re-
lated to their ?eld of study. 
Natasha Noy, a research 
scientist in Google’s 
Arti?cial Intelligence (AI) 
division and key architect 
of Dataset Search, says 
the goal of the project is to 
make data discoverable. 
“Scientists say, ‘I know 
where I need to go to ?nd 
my datasets, but that’s not 
what I always want,’” she 
said to The Verge. “Once 
they step out of their 
unique community, that’s 
when it gets hard.”
The public beta of the 
search tool resembles 
Google’s classic search.
It’s a simple white home 
page featuring the words 
“Google Dataset Search 
Beta” and a simple search 
bar. Underneath the 
search bar are a few sug-
gestions for search terms: 
“Try boston education data 
or weather site:noaa.gov.”
The search results page 
diverges a little from the 
classic layout — it more 
closely resembles Google’s 
updated layout for the 
Gmail inbox, with round-
ed corners and plenty of 
white space.

“Dataset search has always 
been a dif?cult thing to support, 
and I’m hopeful that Google 
stepping in will make it easier.”

DIVIDED DEMOCRACY
in the Age of Social Media
Sunstein’s lecture will focus on how, as the Internet grows more sophisticated, it is creating 
new threats to democracy. Social media companies—such as Facebook—can sort us ever 
more e?ciently into groups of the like-minded, creating echo chambers that amplify our 
views. It's no accident that on some occasions, people of di?erent political views cannot 
even understand each other. Sunstein will describe how the online world creates "cyber-
cascades," exploits "con?rmation bias" and assists "polarization entrepreneurs." And he 
will explain why online fragmentation endangers the shared conversations, experiences 
and understandings that are the lifeblood of democracy. In response, Sunstein will propose 
practical and legal changes to make the internet friendlier to democratic deliberation.

Scott Institute chips in with DOE’s solar tech contest
SEAN MIN
Junior Staffwriter
This week, the Wilton E. 
Scott Institute for Energy 
Innovation was awarded 
the role of Power Connec-
tor in the American-Made 
Solar Prize, a competition 
designed to foster innova-
tion in the solar industry 
run by the Department of 
Energy (DOE) and their 
National Renewable En-
ergy Laboratory (NREL). 
As a Power Connector, 
the Scott Institute will re-
ceive funding to bolster 
recruitment for entries 
into the competition, and 
will be able to earn further 
grants if competitors they 
recruit meet with success 
in the prize.
The goal of the Solar 
Prize is to spur the cre-
ation of innovative solar 
energy solutions and reen-
ergize the American solar 
industry. 
It is composed of three 
successive competitions 
for researchers who 
seek funding to 
make their ideas 
regarding solar 
energy 
a reality, with $3 million 
going to the ?nal winner. 
The DOE hopes to connect 
entrepreneurs and funding 
sources to inventors at 
an early stage and to give 
innovative researchers 
access to the state-of-
the-art technology and 
laboratories.
The Scott Institute and 
other Power Connectors 
have already received 
$100,000 from the DOE’s 
Solar Energy Technologies 
Of?ce as compensation for 
their involvement in the 
competition. 
According to Amanda 
King, the Scott Institute’s 
communications analyst, 
the institute in particular 
has “expanded and am-
pli?ed the DOE and the 
[NREL’s] efforts in this 
competition” and will “ex-
ecute a long-term sustain-
able strategy for scaling 
the American-Made Solar 
Prize,” in addition to en-
tering many of its faculty 
members and students 
into the competition.
A few 
faculty 
members 
and 
students 
have already 
joined 
the Solar 
Prize, 
such as 
Professor 
B. Erik Ydstie and his 
cadre of student research 
assistants. Ydstie is a 
chemical engineering 
professor who is working 
on re?ning the production 
of silicon wafers, an 
integral component of 
solar cells. 
His research focuses on 
a more ef?cient method of 
manipulating the micro-
structure of the Horizontal 
Ribbon Growth to create 
thin silicon. This method 
produces drastically less 
waste than older meth-
ods. Many students are 
currently aiding Ydstie in 
acquiring funding and cre-
ating partnerships to move 
forward with commercial-
izing his project.
The Institute’s staff has 
pledged to support com-
petitors and provide them 
guidance throughout the 
competition. Executive 
director and Innovations 
and Strategic Partnerships 
led by Anna J. Siefken and 
her team will meet with 
competitors in November 
on campus for a coaching 
day. 
Competitors 
will also be able 
to attend CMU 
Energy Week from March 
25 to March 28, an event 
in which they can acquire 
further coaching and 
introduce themselves to 
investors. 
Additionally, Amanda 
King, the Scott Institute’s 
communications analyst, 
has expressed her excite-
ment at acquiring the ser-
vices of an Entrepreneur-
in-Residence who will 
impart advice upon com-
petitors and help with net-
working.
“The [Scott Institute] 
will help competitors 
through each of the three 
stages of the competition 
by providing mentorship 
and access to support re-
sources on a national level 
to solar technology entre-
preneurs in Pennsylvania, 
Ohio, West Virginia, Mary-
land, Delaware, Virginia, 
and Washington, D.C.,” 
said King. 
The NREL chose Power 
Connectors who it believed 
would increase the number 
of viable submissions to 
its competition. In the 
selection process, it placed 
emphasis on networking 
strength, past 
successes, 
and 
creativity. 
Thanks to 
its large network of 
partners and resources, 
the Solar Prize competi-
tion presents a good op-
portunity for the Scott 
Institute to make a lasting 
impact on the solar indus-
try.
The Scott Institute was 
a strong contender due to 
its many partnerships in 
the Mid-West, Mid-Atlan-
tic, and other regions.
Winners of the Ready! 
Contest, the Solar Prize’s 
?rst stage, will be an-
nounced next November. 
Competitors in the Ready! 
Contest must formulate a 
plan of action to solidify 
their ideas and goals. 
Set! and Go! Contest 
winners will be announced 
in February and June of 
next year, respectively. 
The Set! Contest involves 
creating 
a proof of concept; in the 
?nal stage, inventors work 
on actually developing a 
prototype and searching 
for pilot partners.
The Solar Prize’s web-
site encourages anyone 
from “a community mem-
ber with an idea” to “a fa-
cility partner with tools, 
skills, and expertise” to get 
involved.
Power Connectors like 
the Scott Institute play an 
important part in a setting 
intended to bring as many 
people together as pos-
sible to work on advancing 
the solar industry.
Tagged open data now searchable on Google
After a search term is 
entered, the list of search 
results appears on the left 
side rather than on the 
center of the page. The 
rest of the page is occupied 
by a panel that gives 
details about the dataset 
that’s selected on the left-
hand panel. It includes any 
available metadata and 
contextual information, 
including any dates it 
was created, updated, or 
published; time period 
and geographical area 
covered by the data; and 
authors of the dataset.
Jeni Tennison, CEO of 
the Open Data Institute 
believes the involvement 
of a major search engine in 
the world of open data will 
be a huge help to academic 
researchers.. 
“Simply understand-
ing how people search is 
important… what kind of 
terms they use, how they 
express them.” 
Tennison added, “Data-
set search has always been 
a dif?cult thing to sup-
port, and I’m hopeful that 
Google stepping in will 
make it easier.”
This is far from 
Google’s ?rst research 
tool that could be useful in 
academia, of course. 
Google Scholar, a spe-
cialized search tool for ac-
ademic publications, has 
been available since 2004. 
The company has been us-
ing Knowledge Graph, an 
AI-based information or-
ganization tool, to display 
topical information such 
as de?nitions and related 
images next to web search 
results since 2012, with 
data sourced from the CIA 
World Factbook and Free-
base among other sources. 
More recently, Google 
has launched an outreach 
program to university fac-
ulty and students for AI 
research and has worked 
to make hardware for 
the TensorFlow machine 
learning framework avail-
able to researchers for 
free.
In its current form, 
Dataset Search is limited 
to content from NASA, 
NOAA, and Harvard’s 
Dataverse, along with a 
few other institutional 
sources. Dataset Search 
pulls data from Knowl-
edge Graph, but the web 
crawler is unable to intel-
ligently gather informa-
tion about datasets like it 
can for webpages. There 
is also no way to program-
matically access Dataset 
Search, which could 
hinder researchers 
who want to make 
large numbers of rap-
id automated queries. 
Most signi?cantly, 
Google requires that 
publishers tag data-
sets with metadata 
such as descriptions, 
?le size, and authors, 
which can be a time-
consuming and labor-
intensive process.
However, Mark 
Hahnel, CEO of Fig-
share (a research 
repository website 
based in London), is 
con?dent that data 
publishers will quick-
ly adapt to providing 
metadata. “By No-
vember [2017], all 
the universities we’re 
working for had their 
stuff marked up,” he 
said to Nature. 
With Google in-
volved, it is more 
likely that new data-
sets will be properly 
tagged and catego-
rized as they are re-
leased. 
As funding agen-
cies increasingly insist 
that research data is 
made public, Hahnel 
believes using Data-
set Search is a logical 
next step. 
“It legitimizes what 
the funders have been 
trying to do,” he said, 
adding, “I think this 
is a game changer 
for open data in 
academia.”

MLB postseason preview: the Red Sox reign in the AL
BRAD PUSKAR
Staffwriter
As the NFL starts getting 
into gear for their 2018-19 
season, the MLB is wrapping 
up theirs. This week and 
next week, we’ll take a look 
at who’s in the mix for the 
postseason and who should 
be planning their offseason 
moves. This week, it’s the 
American League.
The American League 
(AL) in 2018 was marked 
by a few very good teams, 
and a lot of very bad teams. 
As it stands right now, eight 
of the ?fteen AL teams 
have been eliminated from 
playoff contention, leaving 
seven to duke it out for 
?ve spots in the playoff 
picture. If the season ended 
today, the Boston Red Sox, 
Cleveland Indians, Houston 
Astros, New York Yankees, 
and Oakland Athletics 
would end up rolling their 
way into the postseason. 
The Seattle Mariners have 
a small chance to sneak 
past the Athletics, but it 
would require an almost 
impossible winning streak to 
get close enough for it to be 
interesting.
The Boston Red Sox have 
been dominant all season, 
winning more than 100 
games for just the fourth 
time in their storied team 
history, and they’re looking 
like the team to beat. Mookie 
Betts, J.D. Martinez, and 
Xander Boegarts have all 
had career years and bring 
the team power and speed 
on the basepaths. In terms of 
pitching, Chris Sale, David 
Price, and Rick Porcello have 
been an almost unstoppable 
trio of shutdown pitchers. 
Look for these guys in the 
World Series.
The Cleveland Indians 
have had the bene?t of a 
weak division this year, 
although they still boast a 
dangerous lineup. Coming 
off of back-to-back playoff 
appearances, the Indians 
are prepared for another 
postseason run. Francisco 
Lindor, Edwin Encarnacion, 
and Jose Ramirez are big 
batters, and Corey Kluber, 
Carlos Carrasco, and Trevor 
Bauer (currently on the 10-
day disabled list) can shut 
down opposing hitters. I’m 
not sure how far they’ll 
make it into the postseason, 
as the other four teams in 
the AL-Central will ?nish 
well below the .500 mark. 
However, the addition of 
Josh Donaldson, former 
Toronto Blue Jay and AL 
MVP might give the Indians 
a much-appreciated power 
boost if he can stay healthy.
The Houston Astros are 
trying to repeat as World 
Series Champions, and they 
have the players to get the 
job done. It’s almost entirely 
the same team from last 
year, with returning hitters 
like Carlos Correa, Jose 
Altuve, and World Series 
MVP George Springer all 
ready to make a push to give 
the Astros another World 
Series trophy. Offseason 
acquisition Gerrit Cole has 
backed up Justin Verlander, 
Dallas Keuchel, and Charlie 
Morton to give the Astros 
one of the best pitching 
rotations in baseball. Don’t 
let the idea of a sophomore 
slump color your thinking 
about this Houston team. 
They’re the real deal.
The New York Yankees. 
Not these guys again, right? 
That’s what I thought too, 
but then they traded for 
Andrew McCutchen and 
now, if the Pirates don’t 
make it into the postseason 
– which has a .04 percent 
chance of happening – they 
just might be the team I’ll be 
rooting for. The hitters on 
this team hammer the ball, 
with names like Giancarlo 
Stanton, Aaron Judge (who 
will hopefully be healthy in 
time to actually play), and 
rookie star Gleyber Torres 
all providing ample support 
in the hitting department, 
while a dangerous rotation 
from top-to-bottom, 
including guys like Luis 
Severino, J.A. Happ, and 
CC Sabathia, makes the 
pitching just as deadly as 
any other team in the playoff 
hunt. It’s the Yankees, so 
they always have some black 
magic up their sleeve. Don’t 
count these guys out just 
because they’re sitting in a 
wildcard spot.
The Oakland Athletics 
have been one of the most 
exciting teams in baseball to 
watch this year. Coming off 
a lackluster season in 2017, 
the Athletics stormed into 
playoff contention after the 
all-star break and kicked 
the Seattle Mariners right 
out of it. There’s not many 
names a casual baseball fan 
might recognize, but Khris 
Davis, who has walloped 42 
homers so far, Matt Olson 
and Steven Piscotty all have 
dangerous swings, Matt 
Chapman is a shut-down 
third baseman, and their 
starting rotation including 
Mike Fiers and Trevor Cahill 
have the ability to go deep 
into games. I’d love to see 
the A’s win another World 
Series, especially if it means 
they’ll have to topple a 
powerhouse like the Red Sox 
to get there.
See you next week for 
a wrap of up the National 
League, and how it’s shaping 
up for the postseason.
U.S. OPEN, from A10
King continued. “When 
a man does the same, he’s 
‘outspoken’ & and there are 
no repercussions.” Several 
male players voiced their 
support, acknowledging 
that they have instead 
received “soft warnings” 
for verbal attacks — being 
told that they are pushing 
the limits and any more 
arguing will incur a penalty.
Ramos is known for 
being a strict but fair 
umpire, who adheres closely 
to the rules and treats 
players equally regardless 
of their ranking. However, 
Ramos certainly could have 
taken the “soft warning” 
approach — something 
he did utilize when Novak 
Djokovic complained about 
a unsportsmanlike conduct 
warning earlier this year 
at Wimbledon. Williams, 
however, also clearly lost 
her cool and pushed the 
issue over the course of 
multiple games, allowing 
the infractions to get to 
her head and effect her 
concentration on the court.
Unfortunately, the 
Williams-Ramos confronta-
tion overshadowed Osaka’s 
brilliant play. The 20-year-
old dominated the ?rst set 
and played exceptionally 
well in the second set, even 
without the game penalty 
factored in. She had been 
gaining momentum, win-
ning two straight games 
and taking a 4-3 lead. 
Osaka, whose mother is 
Japanese, has lived in the 
United States since she 
was three, but competes 
for the Japanese Tennis 
Association. With her 
triumph at the U.S. Open, 
Osaka became the ?rst 
Japanese player to ever win 
a Grand Slam title.
Drowned out by the 
drama of the women’s 
?nals was the signi?cance 
of Djokovic’s 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 
victory over Juan Martin 
del Potro in the men’s ?nals 
match the following night. 
Djokovic is now tied with 
Pete Sampras for third on 
the career Grand Slam wins 
list, with 14. He is only 
three behind Rafael Nadal 
and six back from Roger 
Federer. With his success 
this summer at Wimbledon 
and now the U.S. Open, 
the conversation has now 
turned to his legacy and 
his place among the greats. 
Djokovic is now potentially 
on track to surpass Federer 
as the greatest player of all 
time. Declaring Federer as 
the GOAT is an easy case 
to make, but he is nearing 
the end of his career. Nadal, 
on the other hand, needs to 
win several non-clay Slams 
to make the claim that he 
was better than Federer. 
Additionally, Nadal is more 
injury-prone than Djokovic, 
especially during the hard 
court season when his 
knees take a beating.
But if Djokovic keeps 
up his recent form, it is 
not hard to see him adding 
several slams to his trophy 
collection over the next few 
years. He has shown that 
he is a tenacious ?ghter: 
a 22-point duel with del 
Potro while down 4-3 in 
the second set put his grit 
to the test, and he won 
the game, keeping the set 
on-serve. Even if he cannot 
surpass Federer in total 
Slam wins, other factors — 
at the moment, Djokovic 
leads Federer in head-
to-head competition — 
suggest he is right up there 
with the Swiss legend. His 
career’s two most dominant 
stretches are on par with 
Federer’s best stints and 
came against top caliber 
players like Federer, Nadal 
and Andy Murray, while 
many of Federer’s Slams 
wins came against competi-
tors outside the “Big Four.” 
Federer is still at it, and has 
the chance to tack on one 
or two more Slams before 
his time comes to a close 
but Djokovic’s ability to 
return to his former level of 
play will make this a truly 
compelling race.
Tartan’s autodraft led to interesting results in Week 1
With his U.S. Open win, Djokovic takes 14th slam

FANTASY, from A10
Sio also left 20.20 points 
on the table by benching 
Green Bay Packers wide 
receiver Randall Cobb.
Slugs over Last Manning 
Standing 108.54 to 77.10
The only matchup 
of the week where both 
competitors were familiar 
with fantasy football ended 
up being quite anticlimactic; 
Operations Manager 
Adam Tunnard soundly 
beat Publisher Caleb 
Miller with three standout 
performances.
The top player on 
Tunnard’s team Slugs was 
Packers quarterback Aaron 
Rodgers, who scored 24.94 
with 286 passing yards and 
three touchdowns in a classic 
performance. Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers wide receiver 
Mike Evans caught all seven 
passes thrown his way for 
147 yards and a touchdown 
for 20.70 points. Los 
Angeles Chargers running 
back Melvin Gordon rushed 
for 64 yards, but amassed 
18.60 points through 102 
receiving yards.
Miller’s team Last 
Manning Standing was 
on a literal crutch at 
the start, as he forgot to 
bench Philadelphia Eagles 
quarterback Carson Wentz, 
who has been out with an 
injury since last season. 
Lackluster performances 
from Jacksonville Jaguars 
running back Leonard 
Fournette (5.50 points), 
Oakland Raiders wide 
receiver Amari Cooper (1.80 
points), and Chiefs tight end 
Travis Kelce (0.60 points) 
wasted 34.10 points from 
New Orleans Saints running 
back Alvin Kamara on 141 
yards from scrimmage, 
three touchdowns, and 
a two-point conversion. 
Hopefully Miller remembers 
to bench Wentz, but his 
only option, San Francisco 
49ers quarterback Jimmy 
Garoppolo, isn’t coming off 
a great Week 1.
newz over mmichelle123 
106.84 to 99.26
This matchup between 
two fantasy football rookies 
was the closest of the week, 
with News Editor Nora 
Mattson’s team newz edging 
past Pillbox Editor Michelle 
Madlansacay’s self-named 
team mmichelle123.
Mattson’s newz defeated 
mmichelle123 through 
several reliable Week 1 
performances. New York 
Giants running back Saquon 
Barkley scored 18.80 points 
on 106 yards on the ground 
and a touchdown, Patriots 
tight end Rob Gronkowski 
had 16.30 points on 123 
receiving yards and a 
touchdown, and Detroit 
Lions wide receiver Golden 
Tate caught a respectable 
79 yards with a touchdown 
for 13.90 points. Despite 
the win, Mattson should 
look to starting Chargers 
quarterback Philip Rivers, 
who amassed a team-
high 28.96 points on the 
bench, while her starter, 
Lions quarterback Matthew 
Stafford, scored just 8.04 
points.
Madlansacay’s team, 
mmichelle123, was 
projected to take the win 
over newz, but some good 
performances were marred 
by lost points on the 
bench. Minnesota Vikings 
quarterback Kirk Cousins 
threw for 244 yards and 
two touchdowns, totaling 
20.36 points, and Pittsburgh 
Steelers wide receiver 
Antonio Brown recorded 
93 yards and a touchdown 
for 15.30, a relatively low 
point total for him, but still 
decent nonetheless. Starting 
running backs Alex Collins 
of the Baltimore Ravens 
and Derrick Henry of the 
Tennessee Titans and Eagles 
tight end Zach Ertz scored 
only 13.80 points combined, 
bringing her team down.
TARTAN FANTASY over 
Gin and Bear It 82.64 to 
58.22
As Sports Editor, I am 
beyond embarrassed to 
have scored a paltry 58.22 
points, but I can explain (see 
below). Congrats to Photo 
Editor Lisa Qian for her ?rst 
ever win in her ?rst ever 
experience playing fantasy 
football.
Qian’s simply-titled team 
TARTAN FANTASY didn’t 
have to put up a lot of points 
to win, but her team still 
boasted performances worth 
smiling about. While like me, 
one of her players (Seattle 
Seahawks wide receiver 
Doug Baldwin) didn’t score 
a point, but unlike me, she 
had other players to fall 
back on. Saints wide re-
ceiver Michael Thomas’ 22 
points from 180 yards 
and a touchdown 
carried her team, 
which also saw 
Packers tight 
end Jimmy Gra-
ham score only 
0.80 points. 
Next week, Qian 
should look to 
starting Saints quar-
terback Drew Brees over 
Houston Texans quarterback 
Deshaun Watson, who didn’t 
have a great ?rst week.
In the end, one player 
decided the week for 
me. When I autodrafted 
stellar Steelers running 
back Le’veon Bell, I was 
at ?rst celebrating, until I 
remembered that he was 
sitting out games over a 
contract dispute. I traded for 
running back James Conner, 
who took Bell’s place as the 
Steelers’ starter. But I forgot 
to start him. Conner’s 29.20 
points would have given 
me the win, but instead, I 
wasted a 20.42-point week 
from Seahawks quarterback 
Russell Wilson and 11 points 
from the always-reliable 
Ravens kicker 
Justin 
Tucker.
In Week 2, Sio’s Pillbox 
faces off against Miller’s 
Last Manning Standing, 
and Madlansacay and I 
battle for our ?rst win. In 
the matchups of Week 1’s 
winners, Le’s futbol looks to 
defeat Tunnard’s Slugs and 
Qian’s TARTAN FANTASY 
takes on Mattson’s newz. 
Check back next week to 
read how it all goes down.

Women’s soccer falls in ?rst defeat of the season
CALEB MILLER

Serena Williams is no 
stranger to controversy at 
the U.S. Open. In her 2009 
semi-?nals match against 
Kim Clijsters, Williams was 
called for a foot fault on 
her second serve, gifting 
Clijsters double match 
point. Rattled and under 
pressure, she launched an 
expletive-?lled threat at 
the lineswoman. Having 
already received a conduct 
warning for throwing her 
racket earlier in the match, 
her tirade resulted to a 
one-point penalty, handing 
victory to Clijsters.
Two years later, 
Williams was facing break 
point against Sam Stosur 
in the ?nals, when she 
ripped what appeared 
to be a forehand winner. 
“Come on!” she shouted 
in excitement. But when 
Stosur managed to tip the 
ball off her racket’s frame, 
Williams’ exclamation led 
the chair umpire to enact 
the hindrance rule, which 
states that if a player 
deliberately hinders the 
opponent’s ability to play 
the point, the opponent 
wins the point. Stosur was 
awarded the point and 
thus the game, prompting 
a verbal onslaught from 
Williams towards the chair 
umpire.
This year, on Sept. 8, 
Williams and U.S. Open 
of?cials clashed for a third 
time during her ?nals 
match against Naomi 
Osaka. After losing the 
?rst set 6-2, Williams 
was up 1-0 in the second 
set when chair umpire 
Carlos Ramos issued her 
a warning for receiving 
coaching. Williams insisted 
to Ramos that she had not 
been cheating, and play 
continued. After being 
broken to make the score 
3-2, she smashed her racket 
in frustration, bringing on 
her second violation and 
causing Osaka to start the 
next game 15-0.
Williams called Ramos 
a thief and demanded an 
apology. “You stole a point 
from me,” she declared. Af-
ter losing two more games 
— Osaka now leading 4-3 
— Williams turned her at-
tention back to Ramos. 
“You are a liar. You will 
never be on a court of mine 
as long as you live. When 
are you going to give me 
my apology? Say you are 
sorry,” she insisted, leading 
him to issue another code 
violation for abuse. A third 
violation meant Osaka 
was given an entire game, 
pushing her lead to 5-3. She 
won the following game, 
winning the match and her 
?rst Grand Slam title.
During her argument 
with Ramos and other 
referees, Williams 
mentioned that she had 
heard men say a lot worse 
and not be penalized, 
causing an uproar 
concerning sexism in tennis 
of?ciating. Legend Billie 
Jean King tweeted, “When 
a woman is emotional, 
she’s ‘hysterical’ and she’s 
penalized for it.”

The tenth-ranked 
Carnegie Mellon University 
women’s soccer team 
welcomed the ?fth-
ranked Messiah College 
to Pittsburgh in a top-ten 
matchup on Sept. 15. After 
a home win on Wednesday 
for their third victory in a 
row, the Tartans fell to the 
Messiah Falcons, 4-1, in  
the team’s ?rst loss of the 
season. They now have a 
4-1 record on the season.
The game-deciding 
action occurred right in 
the opening minutes. The 
Falcons scored ?rst at the 
two-minute mark with 
a goal to the far corner 
from 25 feet out. The 
visiting team struck again 
six minutes later on a 
penalty kick, after Tartan 
goalkeeper Carolyn Botz 
was penalized for tripping. 
The goal would ultimately 
become the game-winning 
goal. Two minutes later, 
in the 11th minute, the 
Tartans cut Messiah’s lead 
to 2-1 on a penalty kick by 
junior mid?elder Sydney 
Webber.
In the following 10 
minutes, the Tartans 
committed three fouls, 
which became a pattern 
throughout the match. 
In the 21st minute, the 
Falcons scored again, 
making the score 3-1. The 
Tartans tried to respond 
and dig themselves out 
of the two-point de?cit 
for the rest of the match, 
but the Falcons defended 
well to complement their 
blistering offensive play. 
In the 41st, 43rd, and 44th 
minutes, the Tartans ?red 
off three shots, two of them 
on goal, but were never 
able to reach the back of 
the net. Early in the second 
period, in the 57th minute, 
the Falcons scored the ?nal 
goal of the game, ensur-
ing their win with over 30 
minutes left to play.
The Tartans ?nished 
with nine shots, four on 
goal, with two saves and 
two corner kicks. The 
Falcons recorded similar 
numbers, with eight shots, 
six on goal, with three 
saves and three corner 
kicks. However, the biggest 
difference in the match 
was penalties; the Tartans 
recorded 12, while the 
Falcons committed just ?ve.
This week, the Tartans 
look to bounce back in 
the ?nal match of their 
three-match homestand. 
On Friday, they face off 
against visiting Washington 
& Jefferson, set to begin at 
7 p.m.

The start of the NFL 
season means something 
else: fantasy football 
is back! For the third 
consecutive year, The 
Tartan has formed a 
league, and this column 
will feature our weekly 
recaps through the end of 
the season, when we crown 
the Tartan Fantasy Football 
champion.
This year’s league 
consists of teams picked by 
staff members throughout 
The Tartan. My competitors 
are: Publisher Caleb Miller, 
Operations Manager Adam 
Tunnard, News Editor Nora 
Mattson, Visual Editor 
Tracy Le, Photo Editor Lisa 
Qian, and Pillbox Editors 
Izzy Sio and Michelle 
Madlansacay.
Since half the league 
had never played fantasy 
football or didn’t even know 
what it was, we decided 
to autodraft. While the 
suspense of a live draft is 
unmatched, the autodraft 
allowed us to start as fair 
as possible, and it was 
pretty cool to wake up to 
?nd a team ready for you. 
Getting players according 
to NFL.com’s top rankings 
led to some interesting 
matchups. Without further 
ado, here is Week 1’s recap.
futbol over Pillbox 
132.64 to 120.68
In the highest-scoring 
matchup of the week, 
Visual Editor and fantasy 
football rookie Tracy Le’s 
team futbol defeated 
Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s 
aptly named team Pillbox.
Le’s team had one of 
the best autodrafts of the 
league, landing Carolina 
Panthers quarterback 
Cam Newton, Cincinnati 
Bengals running back 
Joe Mixon, and Atlanta 
Falcons wide receiver Julio 
Jones. Each of her stars 
delivered: Newton passed 
for 161 yards and scored a 
rushing touchdown on his 
way to 18.24 points, Mixon 
rushed for 95 yards and a 
touchdown and added 54 
yards through the air for 
20.90 points, and Jones 
had 10 catches for 169 
yards for 18 points. But 
it was Kansas City Chiefs 
wide receiver Tyreek Hill 
who pushed the team to the 
win. Hill’s 169 yards, two 
touchdowns, and 91-yard 
punt return totaled to a 
team high of 29.30 points.
This league is Sio’s 
second this season, and 
she, a New York Jets 
fan, lamented that she 
autodrafted three New 
England Patriots players. 
No matter, she started Pa-
triots quarterback Tom 
Brady, who collected 
21.28 points in a 277-yard 
and three-touchdown 
performance. Los Angeles 
Rams standout running 
back Todd Gurley rushed 
for 109 yards and a passing 
touchdown to 20.70 points. 
Pillbox was let down by 
Falcons running back 
Devonta Freeman who 
scored a measly 5 points, 
and is out for the next few 
weeks.

Soccer fans in the 
Northern Hemisphere 
know it’s fall every year 
when the Champions 
League Group Stage rolls 
back around, and after 
a few months off, the 
tournament is all set to 
kick off again. As expected, 
the top teams of Europe—
the Manchesters’, the 
Madrids’, et al.—are back 
for the 64th edition of the 
League, but the surprise 
of the year is a return to 
the Champions League 
by Swiss side Young 
Boys BSC, a club based 
in Bern. Young Boys has 
not earned a spot in the 
Champions League for 
the last 32 years. Another 
drought ended this year, 
but only twelve years long, 
with AEK Athens qualify-
ing for the League. Both 
teams just snuck into their 
qualifications by beating 
their last opponents in the 
qualifying round 3-2 on 
aggregate.
As for the top teams, 
some shake ups in the 
summer transfer window 
have given and taken life 
away for a few teams in 
their quest for the crown 
of Europe. For Manchester 
City, they’re big signing 
this summer was right 
wing Riyad Mahrez, 
formerly of Leicester 
City, who is going to give 
a boost to the already 
dominant Manchester 
City attack. However, the 
two trademark transfers 
of the summer were be-
tween Champions League 
teams. After a stunning 
appearance at the World 
Cup, Kylian Mbappe 
was transferred from 
A.S. Monaco to Paris 
Saint-Germain (PSG) 
for almost fifty million 
pounds more than the 
other trademark transfer: 
Cristiano Ronaldo. 
Ronaldo, a transfer from 
Real Madrid to Juventus, 
and Mbappe are two 
superstar players who 
could have a huge impact 
on the Champions League 
as the tournament winds 
down. For the past few 
years, PSG has struggled 
to defeat Chelsea in the 
knockout rounds of the 
tournament, but Mbappe’s 
speed and technical ability 
could give PSG the boost to 
break into the final rounds. 
Real Madrid will survive 
without Ronaldo.
The last three 
tournaments have been 
won by Real Madrid, 
with the help of Cristiano 
Ronaldo, so Madrid 
will have a tougher 
time reaching the final 
stages. On the other 
hand, Madrid’s lineup is a 
weird, but talented, mix of 
veterans and young players 
that might just have what it 
takes to pull the team into 
the semifinals or finals of 
the tournament. Juventus, 
the team that bought 
Ronaldo, is in a similar boat 
since adding the superstar, 
but they are just a little 
bit more experienced than 
the young players on the 
Madrid side.
Juventus is looking 
to end a 13-year 
championship drought 
with their purchases this 
summer, and they may 
just have what it takes to 
cruise through the group 
stage and dominate into 
the knockout round to a 
finals victory. The last two 
years have seen Juventus 
lose to the eventual 
champions, Real Madrid; 
now, the Juventus team 
has more experience, a 
little more talent, and the 
determination required to 
work through the dregs of 
Winter matches to earn a 
Champions League victory. 
If I was forced into picking 
a team to win, Juventus 
would be my choice. On the 
other hand, the Champions 
League is always a toss up 
in the knockout round, so 
look out for potential dark 
horse teams like PSG or 
Atletico Madrid to give the 
traditionally better teams a 
tough time.
One thing every 
Champions League fan 
can agree with, though, is 
the general lack of ability 
in English teams. The 
prediction I am going to 
make with true confidence 
is that no English team will 
make the semifinals this 
year. Recently, Manchester 
City manager, Pep 
Guardiola, was recently 
quoted in an interview 
with Spanish football news 
outlet Marca as saying, 
“The Premier League 
seems better than it is 
because of the way it’s sold 
and the way they broadcast 
the product.” Guardiola 
may have just meant the 
league as a whole is not 
as good as it seems, but I 
believe that top to bottom, 
English teams are oversold 
and cannot stand up to the 
other European giants: 
Bayern Munich, Barcelona, 
Real Madrid, and Juventus. 
Over the past few years, 
English teams have gone 
out earlier than expected 
(with few exceptions) and 
watch for the norm to hold 
true in this edition of the 
Champions League.

On balancing your workload with your personal wellness
Dear Izzy,
It’s the first month of school, and I honestly only 
have one goal this year — and no, it is not to have 
a 4.0 QPA. My one goal this year is to better my 
own mental health. I’m starting to realize how 
much time I’ve been investing into my academics, 
my extracurriculars, and my job search and 
obsessing over how I want everything to work out 
for me. But overall, it’s been stressing me out and 
taking some of my time away from the friends 
and the people who care about me. So this year, 
I’m really trying to have a better work-social life 
balance. Do you have any tips on how to get me 
started?
Sincerely, 
Having Equal Allotments Leads To Happiness, I 
Surely Want Even Any, Like, Time, Help
Dear HEALTH IS WEALTH,
First of all, go you for realizing the importance 
of your own mental health! And also, go you for 
realizing it this early in the semester. It can be 
easy to forget these kinds of things throughout the 
year, but it’s a really important priority that some 
people, myself definitely included, neglect.
The first thing I’d suggest is time management. 
Plan out when you want to work and how long 
you want to work for. Having that time frame will 
help keep the rest of your day in perspective. Most 
importantly, don’t forget to plan out breaks! They 
will help you relax a little bit from work. And with 
that work-life balance, you can do whatever you 
want.
To add onto that, write down a list of the things 
you love. It’ll help you remember them for those 
moments when you feel like you’re stressing out 
too much, or you’re burnt out, or you’re just 
overworked. And during those moments, do 
something from that list. Take time to remember the 
things you love and cherish. Doing so just might 
give you the much needed energy to solve that 
problem you’ve been stuck on or to come up with 
that last sentence in your paper.
Most importantly, you’re not alone. Take time to 
remember the people you love and cherish too. It 
is so easy to accidentally close yourself off from 
your friends in college, but don’t forget to reach 
out to them — even if you’re just going to grab 
dinner. Having friends, companions, and just other 
people by your side is the best way to lift up your 
spirits.
Hope this helps!

Go (for the) fish! 
After waking up on Saturday, I knew I’d have 
so much to do in the morning that I sadly 
wouldn’t have time to make an actual breakfast. 
So I packed some snacks in my bag and went 
to campus to go take care of some of my 
responsibilities. By the time I was finished with 
everything it was already around twelve, which 
I guess is a fine time for brunch. So a couple 
of my friends and I decided to stay close to 
campus, and we went to Union Grill.
The location: Union Grill is right in the middle of 
Craig Street, so it’s super close to campus. The 
restaurant usually stands out to me because of 
its nice plants for its outdoor seating. And also, 
since the outdoor seating is basically right on 
the sidewalk, every person that walks by the 
restaurant can see who’s sitting outside and the 
food they’re eating. It’s a nice way of enticing 
customers.
The food: I didn’t realize this until recently, but 
the fish dishes at Union Grill are really fresh! 
The past few times I’ve gone, I’ve ordered the 
salmon burger and it never disappoints. The 
salmon was cooked perfectly and although they 
keep the sandwich pretty simple with two buns, 
lettuce, tomato, and a pickle, all the natural 
flavors just blend so well together. It even comes 
with your choice of salsa or spread to add a little 
more flavor if you’d like; I usually ask for the 
corn salsa. And most meals you order at Union 
Grill come with sides, like their famous waffle 
fries, fresh veggies, or mashed potatoes. They 
do give you a lot of food, but for pretty decent 
prices!
The vibe: I often get an old school vibe whenever 
I go to Union Grill, I guess because most of the 
people who eat there are families and senior 
citizens. I really enjoy the comfortable social 
atmosphere of the restaurant; it sometimes makes 
me forget that I’m even near a college campus.
Lit or Nah: I wouldn’t say it’s very lit, but there 
is a pretty big bar where people can order their 
drinks/food and at the same time watch sports 
on the big flat screens. I would say Union Grill 
is too much of a family go-to place for it to be 
anything else, which definitely isn’t a bad thing. 
The food’s good, the people are nice, and I think 
it’s a great place to go for any meal of the day.

---------------------------------------------------

Derived from rapper Eminem’s hit 2000 song of the same name, 
“stan” can mean a multitude of things, from a successful fan account 
that posts photos, news, and updates about an artist almost religious-
ly, to a troll with intentions of bullying anyone who criticizes their 
icon of choice. Stan culture has grown and changed signiicantly 
with the aid of Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and other social media 
websites. Unfortunately, the latter situation has often taken charge, 
as bullying, “dragging,” or calling out certain celebrities has 
gained popularity and thousands of retweets, shares, and likes.
These fans continue to dominate the internet, even in times of mourn-
ing. On Sept. 7, one of the most beloved and respected rappers in the industry passed 
away at age 26: Malcolm McCormick, better known as Mac Miller. Across all social 
media networks, fans, fellow artists, and regular people paid their respects with videos, 
pictures, or 280-character tweets. However, lurking behind the outpour of love and pain 
were fans who blamed Miller’s death on the one person who “could have helped him”: 
Ariana Grande.
Ariana Grande, a highly successful pop icon, faced the wrath of trolls the second her 
split with Mac Miller was announced back in May 2018. Most notably, a tweet by 
Twitter user Elijah Flint went viral with nearly 20,000 retweets and 83,000 likes. The 
tweeter insinuated that Grande should not have left Miller — especially because he 
wrote an entire album devoted to her — because the split “caused” Miller to get a DUI. 
Just hours later, Grande gave a response to the double standard presented by Flint: a 
woman should not be expected to magically heal her signiicant other, especially when 
the situation becomes toxic—she is another human, not his savior.
Again, the argument that Grande should have “saved him” came to 
light following the passing of Mac Miller. The negative comments 
notably came from Instagram, as users accused her of “killing 
him,” of being “evil,” and of ignoring her “responsibility” to speak 
out. The stream of comments grew so cruel and overbearing that 
Grande had no choice but to disable her Instagram comments. For a

week following the death of a man she once truly loved, Ariana Grande mourned 
peacefully and independently, without the poisonous inÜuence of stans.
This past Friday, Grande broke her silence and wrote an emotional, moving tribute 
to Mac Miller—someone who made a signiicant impact in her life after two years 
together — on Instagram, along with a video of them together. Her words were 
heartfelt and honest, not bitter or mean. She was praised for her tribute across 
social media platforms for its ejually heartwarming and saddening nature.
This issue is deeply rooted in the double standard placed on women to help, heal, 
and tend to men; but when a woman is in trouble, she is at fault and responsible 
for caring for herself. Phat we need to do as a society is to stop placing the 
burden of one’s mental health and life problems on a single person, whether it is a 
friend, a family member, or a romantic partner. Ariana Grande is not, and never 
will be, a man’s manic pixie dream girl, a fairy who can heal him with the snap of 
her ingers. This expectation, however is not to be confused with the genuine care 
of loved ones in need of mental help4 the “savior” expectation, in contrast, can 
become toxic and emotionally draining. In actuality, refuting the claims of stans, 
Grande stated that she prayed incredibly hard for Mac Miller’s sobriety — even 
when their time together had come to an end.
Social media will always be inÜuential, powerful, and unstoppable. The stan 
culture that has emerged from social media has had its positives, whether it entails 
worshipping and appreciating artists, or creating a space for people to interact 
and share their respect of a celebrity. Pith this positivity, however, comes a dark 
side that consists of bullying, trolling, and biting ights between two fandoms, two 
opposing beliefs, or two people. There is a line that is crossed when mourning a 
celebrity death online, especially one as signiicant and painful as the passing of 
Iittsburgh native Mac Miller. This time it was crossed. ;ut in the end, we lost a  
highly respected, talented, and beautiful man. May Mac Miller rest in peace.

---------------------------------------------------

Introspection and reflection are requisites for growth.
As Carnegie Mellon students, I’m sure that all of you have heard that 
message in one form or another, be it through lectures, seminars, or 
newsletters. While it feels like the university talks about the concept of 
mental wellness ad nauseam—especially to the first years—it doesn’t 
change the fact that it’s a priority. After all, getting a degree isn’t 
worth going off the deep end, and it’s wonderful to be in a college 
environment where that’s given due emphasis.
What can you do about your mental wellness?
The school offers excellent resources like the mindfulness room and 
free subscriptions to Headspace, and while meditation and relaxation 
are very important, I’d like to suggest another healthy practice: 
reading classical literature.
I’m sure we all have bad memories from high school of cramming 
Sparknotes and Cliffnotes the night before an English test because 
we were too lazy or unwilling to do the assigned reading. The syntax 
and diction were too confusing, the books were too long, and in the 
frenetic atmosphere that characterizes secondary education, nobody 
had time for that.
It seems that for many, the habit of reading for pleasure has fallen by 
the wayside, overshadowed by other competing demands. When we 
do read, it’s commonly popular fiction or works of technical interest 
rather than the authors of old. While there’s nothing wrong with that, 
those pieces primarily entertain us or add to our body of knowledge 
rather than prompting us to think about our own lives on a deeper 
and more personal level.
That’s precisely why classical literature in a recreational capacity is 
so important. Well before the onset of the digital age, brilliant think-
ers focused on answering the great questions about life and human 
nature, and lucky for us they put pen to paper, handing their insights 
down through history.
Without the aid of Google or Wikipedia, past writers relied on their 
own intuitions, observations, and reflections, looking within themselves 
and out to the world for inspiration. When they found something 
noteworthy, they either delivered it through narrative (as in Upton 
Sinclair’s The Jungle) or they just compiled their ideas and presented 
them to the audience (as in Henry David Thoreau’s Walden).
In reading such works, we in part retrace the author’s steps, seeing 
the world through their perspective and listening to what they have 
to say. Often, we are exposed to worldly and novel ways of thinking, 
and we sometimes find answers to our own problems. These are the 
books that relieve us of our tunnel vision, forcing us to consider the 
bigger, more abstract picture. We expand our horizons, adding to the 
richness of our thoughts and the serenity of our minds. Like a tree, the 
more entrenched we are in the body of human wisdom, the less likely 
we are to be blown aside by the winds of adversity, guided by those 
who came before us.
Does this mean that you must understand every single word that 
you read? Nope; it’s the central ideas that matter most. Should you 
go and read (or reread) Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter or Milton’s 
Paradise Lost right now? Of course not. But I encourage you, the next 
time you’re trying to find a book to invest in, consider some of the 
older titles. You just might be surprised by how much you enjoy—and 
how much you can gain from—the books you once demonized.
By the way, we’re only talking about mental wellness here. 
Unfortunately, reading books won’t make you physically fit; you still 
have to hit the gym for that.

We honor corrupt philanthropists

Our faculty’s White Faces gleam in projector lights,
their White Hands are tainted by chalk dust
and Expo markers,
and surely they understand the implications of education,
but
my heart hurts
as brown hands serve dollops of food
and swipe our cards;
as white hands cut vibrant ribbons commemorating vibrant White Money;
brown eyes exchange understanding for a fleeting moment before looking the other way.
They pass with
emblems of late night grease
plastered above their hearts—
wear your uniform with pride, no one grumbles.
My hurt hurts
yet I know
the condition of my little heart
is not enough
to abate an issue
larger than CMU itself.

Hollywood’s Newest 
Marketing Gimmick
I recently got around to watching Crazy Rich Asians. It was a film that I had been looking forward to watching for 
quite some time. The trailers weren’t very impressive, but the film was being marketed as Hollywood’s first all-Asian 
cast in 25 years. To top if off, critics tripped over themselves to shower the film with praise. Audiences loved it, Crazy 
Rich Asians exploded at the box office, and it made people cry. So, against my normal jaded nature, I was relatively 
excited to watch this film.
I left the theater unenthused, disappointed by a film that had so much potential yet squandered a lot of it. It certainly 
is an important milestone for Hollywood, yet it was very cheesy, safe, and cliche rather than being subversive and 
smart. It’s stylistically very bland, with uninspired cinematography and shot composition despite some 
wonderful production design. Save for a handful of individual, incredible scenes I won’t spoil, the characterization 
and plotting are generally uninteresting and occasionally frustrating. It felt very much like a Hollywood product than 
something authentic and genuine. Because of all of this, it felt more like a movie trying to pander towards Asians and 
Americans too lazy to watch a foreign film rather than being an actual movie that just happened to be about Asians 
who are also crazy rich.
If you take away the fact that the characters are Chinese, the film doesn’t really hold up as a romantic comedy. Yet, 
despite the movie being about the lives of a Chinese family in Singapore, it doesn’t do much on that front either. The 
reason for this is that the character writing and plotting is considerably formulaic. The film could have had more of a 
satirical bite to its humor, which there were only hints of throughout the film. Nick and Rachel, the two 
protagonists, could have had a lot more tension between them for Nick’s family secret. The Big Sick did this very well, 
where protagonists Kumail and Emily are driven apart by Kumail’s decision to hide his family’s secret from Emily, 
which created a lot of interesting conflict and arcs for them. Even many of the side characters could have been less 
one-note in Crazy Rich Asians or could have done more to add to Rachel’s arc. There was clearly effort put into the 
film, but there is also a very conscious feeling that the film is self-aware of what it represents, so the script plays it 
mostly safe.
Crazy Rich Asians is one significant part of this new diversity trend that has swept Hollywood in the last few years. In 
my usage of the word “trend,” I am not trying to say that diversity is bad. Rather, Hollywood treats diversity like a 
marketing gimmick rather than a cause to be championed. It fills a niche market for a certain demographic, and other 
audience members who are not totally against that initiative tag along to watch it, and the film profits. It’s unfortunate 
that diversity is relevant if and only if the bottom line is involved, which makes the success of Crazy Rich Asians that 
much more important. But taken as a whole, the movie can’t seem to be separated from the entire 
marketing, which is somewhat troubling for the discussion about the merits of the film as well as the surrounding 
political discourse.
Part of this marketing strategy, of course, is that if money isn’t made on the gimmick, then Hollywood has no 
incentive to do it again. Diversity has always existed, but as the media tends to do, an observation of a diverse cast-
ing gets overblown and overhyped. Hollywood executives notice this and realize that they can capitalize on it, but 
are also typically hesitant at the idea of giving original scripts and good roles to diverse casts that aren’t based on

---------------------------------------------------

previous intellectual properties, such as a superhero cinematic universe or upcoming remakes of older films. Crazy Rich Asians 
differs in that way where now there is a script with potential available for a diverse cast. Yet, there is always a risk involved 
for the producers. If the movie doesn’t do well, then that would mean that having a diverse cast isn’t marketable or profitable, 
and Hollywood would stop. So then the movie is safe and appeals to a mass in a certain time period rather than standing as a 
work of art that will last a long time.
It also helps shield the film from criticism. Having gone through several reviews to try and see what made the film critically 
successful and taking anecdotal accounts from friends, a lot of the praise was consistently focused on the casting and cultural 
impact rather than any other element of the film. Even negative reviews of the film have to acknowledge it because it is such a 
significant portion of the film. However, this brings us back to square one, where without the diverse cast, the film doesn’t have 
much else to offer as a result.
To end this article, let’s talk about a little film I watched in the same week called Searching. Essentially, the film takes place 
entirely over a computer, where a man searches through the rabbit hole known as the internet for clues in order to find his 
missing daughter. It takes a very by-the-numbers plot and turns it into a smart and subversive thriller with lots of suspense, 
visual detail and storytelling, memorable characters regardless of how small their roles are, and real emotional weights 
towards the end. It also features an Asian lead, but the fact that he is Asian doesn’t matter. That’s where Hollywood should be 
heading, and slowly, with movies like Searching, it is heading there. But in order to get there, movies like Crazy Rich Asians 
need to do well too.
So my request is to see films like Crazy Rich Asians so that films like Searching can be made, where better scripts are given to 
diverse casts. Then watch films like Searching so that more original scripts can keep being made. Eventually, with some effort 
and voting with our wallets, we can get rid of the term diversity entirely and instead have an inclusionary casting process, 
where different demographics and ethnicities are the norm rather than a reactionary cultural trend.

Why I Love Romantic 
Comedies 
What is it about romantic comedies that makes them so good? They’re pretty ridiculous most of the time, and yet my friends and I can’t stop watching them. To 
be honest, ever since Netflix added the first and second Princess Diaries, the only movies I’ve wanted to watch after are movies just like it: 13 Going on 30, 
all three Bridget Jones’ Diary movies, Clueless, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, and the list goes on… At the moment, I’m actually in the middle of watching 
Netflix’s newly added teen romantic comedy, Sierra Burgess is a Loser.
The thing about these kinds of movies is that most of the storylines are reused and therefore predictable, the chances of the events in the movie actually happen-
ing to you are nearly impossible, and yet everything about these movies is so relatable. Now, let me clarify: for me, rom coms are pretty spot-on with what I wish 
had happened to me in high school. Finally gaining my self-confidence, getting back at mean girls, finding true love in the end - these were all things I had hoped 
to achieve by the end of my high school career. I mean, if the main characters of these movies were able to do it in the span of an hour and forty-five minutes, 
then there was definitely a possibility for me to get this happily ever after ending at the end of my four years of high school. Of course that wasn’t the case for 
me, as well as for many others.
But as I move further and further away from my high school years, I’ve realized that I’ve actually been creating my own happily ever after, just by learning more 
about myself. In high school I defined happy endings based on those from the rom coms I watched, because I guess I didn’t know any better? At the time I was 
still figuring myself out, and to be honest, I still am. But at least now, I have a better idea of what I want and value in life. Learning all this just happened over 
time and through gaining more experience. The stories in rom coms are a huge representation of who I used to and wanted to be, and looking back on that is 
very amusing to me.
It’s crazy that my past love for rom coms came just from me wishing I was the characters in those movies. Now, I love watching them because they bring back 
old memories and feelings from when I was a more inexperienced and immature version of myself. The characters and their stories are things I can still laugh 
at, cringe at, and occasionally swoon over. I don’t really care how ridiculous and unrealistic romantic comedies are, watching them will always be one of my 
favorite guilty pleasures.

This weekend, the most ambitious crossover event 
in history returns to McConomy Auditorium! In 
Marvel Studios’ nineteenth movie, Avengers: Infinity 
War, the stakes for the Avengers have never been 
higher as they must come together to stop the mad 
titan, Thanos (Josh Brolin), from collecting all six 
Infinity Stones, which are ancient cosmic artifacts 
that enable its user to control all aspects of reality. 
This summer’s biggest blockbuster (and the fourth 
highest-grossing movie of all time) is the culmination 
of ten years of Marvel Studios history, and it pays 
off throughout the movie’s entire two and a half-hour 
runtime. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo perfectly 
balance elements of humor and darkness, the screen 
time of at least twenty-one characters, and differing 
yet compelling perspectives of our heroes as well as 
the fiercest villain that they’ve ever faced. Writers 
and Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) architects, 
Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, help to 
elevate the movie to new heights within the MCU 
by launching it into new storytelling territory for 
Marvel’s future slate of movies. Josh Brolin delivers 
a career-defining and legendary performance as 
one of the best and most terrifying villains in Marvel 
Studios history, holding his own against Marvel 
Studios veterans Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, 
and Benedict Cumberbatch. And even in its bleakest 
moments, it’s impossible not to have a great time 
during every grand character entrance, every quick-
witted quip, and every epic fight. Avengers: Infinity 
War promises to be not just a classic Marvel Studios 
film, but a classic blockbuster for decades to come.
