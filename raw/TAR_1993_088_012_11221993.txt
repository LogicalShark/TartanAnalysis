CMU asks DoD to focus queries
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan News Editor
The Department of Defense (DoD) has 
still not told Carnegie Mellon Univer­
sity what its investigation is centering 
on.
They have, however, given the Uni­
versity more time to prepare for it.
Provost Paul Christiano says that the 
deadline for producing the documents 
the DoD has requested has been ex­
tended from November 12 to December
13. The extension came after negotia­
tions between the Defense Investigative 
Service and the University legal coun­
sel.
“They’ve indicated that they would 
give us some extra time — an extra 
month — before we would have to give 
them any documents,” says Christiano, 
“but they still have not narrowed the 
scope of the investigation.”
On Tuesday, October 19, agents from
the Inspector General’s office of the DoD 
presented University President Robert 
Mehrabian with a subpoena requesting 
all University documents pertaining to 
any DoD contracts or grants with CMU 
since July 1,1986 [Please see “DoD in­
vestigates contracts with CMU,” 10/25/ 
93].
It has been estimated that the ap­
proximately 140 DoD contracts and 
grants with the University in that pe­
riod of time resulted in millions of pages 
of documents.
“They still haven’t focused the investi­
gation,” says Christiano. “The volume of 
material is still totally impracticable. 
They still might not realize what the 
volume of documentation really is.”
Christiano says that to the best of his 
knowledge, no DoD personnel have ques­
tioned any CMU staff members or asked 
for any information.

Senate tables grading proposal
By MARKUS KASSBOHRER
Tartan Staffuiriter
The motion on plus/minus- 
grading for CMUs undergradu­
ates will be voted on in Tuesday’s 
Student Senate session, after hav­
ing been tabled the week before. 
It would introduce incremental 
grades from A- to D+.
The proposal now on the table 
would affect only incoming fresh­
men, whose grades would be re­
corded under both systems.
GSIA senator Desmond O’Con­
nor said he supported the new 
system. “It works at GSIA,” he 
said. “It gives more opportunity 
to differentiate.”
Arik Cohen, senator for SCS, 
said that he will vote against it. 
In a survey of his constitutents, 
he received 62 votes against it
and 14 in favor. He said that the 
new system would invariably 
shift QPAs and therefore skew 
the comparison between grades 
with and without plus/minus.
“It doesn’t help if it is indicated 
on the grade transcript,” he said, 
“[because] a recruiter looks at 
that for about 35 seconds. He 
doesn’t read the fine print.”
He would, however, notice that 
the candidate were doing a dif­
ferent job at CMU at one point 
than at another even if he didn’t, 
Cohen said.
“It would be a harder job for the 
Teaching Assistants, too, having 
more choices to make,” he said. 
“What is the differentiation be­
tween a B+ and a B?”
Besides, with so many grade 
levels a student wouldn’t have a 
good feeling as to where he stands
in a class, said Cohen. “It de­
pends on what type you are. I like 
the idea of going into a final know­
ing what my grade will be.” 
“When I first started working 
on the idea, I was really rather 
opposed to it,” said Dawn Wall- 
hausen, an H&SS sophomore and 
chair of Senate’s Academic Af­
fairs committee.
“The [AA] committee really 
didn’t like it either. It’s better for 
you if you get a B+, but worse if 
you get a B-,” said Wallhausen.
Wallhausen said that her view 
first started to change after she 
talked to Vice Provost for Educa­
tion Erwin Steinberg.
“He said that everyone on the 
faculty supported it, to one de­
gree or another,” said Wall­
hausen. “Heexplainedthatitdoes

Bell Atlantic completes 
phone study on campus
By JASON HEINLEIN
Tartan Staffuiriter
Since February, Bell Atlantic Mo­
bile has been conducting a study at 
Carnegie Mellon University to deter­
mine the need for “person-focused 
rather than location-focused” commu­
nication with a new type of cellular 
phone. This study included 100 CMU 
faculty, graduate students, and stu­
dents and was part of a larger study 
thatBellAtlanticwas conductingwith 
others in the Pittsburgh area.
According to Lisa Lightner, assis­
tant director of public relations for 
Humanities and Social Sciences, all
100 participants were given cellular 
phones free of all charges for the pe­
riod of the study. The participants 
were members of either the produc­
tion staff in the Drama Department, 
University Relations, telecommuni­
cations, or “Policy 3” students. They 
were then instructed to use the phone 
as much as they wanted for local calls, 
but to limit their long distance calls to 
those pertaining to work.
By giving the phones to the people 
studied free of charge, Lightner said, 
“they can see if people really have a 
need for the service.” If there had 
been charges for the service, then 
people would not have used it as much 
asthey wanted to, and the study would 
have inaccurately found that there 
was no need for the service.
According to Bell Atlantic, the ben­
efits of the phone were divided into 
two categories: personal and business 
needs.
The personal benefits of the phone 
were “peace of mind” from knowing 
that they can be reached at all times,
“flexibility” because the new type of 
phone can use the same phone num­
ber at home, office, or outdoors, and 
“accessibilty” because the users can 
accept all calls, or restrict certain calls 
if desired.
According to BellAtlantic, the busi­
ness benefits of the phone were: “in­
creased productivity,” since the phone 
can be used in situations that would 
not normally be productive (in traffic, 
at lunch, etc.), “improved responsive­
ness” by being able to respond to cus­
tomers immediately, and “accessibil­
ity,” or the ability to be reached at all 
times, if desired.
Martin Weiss, a University of Pitts­
burgh professor and telecommunica­
tions expert, said there are other ad­
vantages to the new phone. Weiss 
said, “The link between the station 
and the phone is digital whereas cur­
rent cellular phones are analog.” The 
benefit being that “digital is less noisy” 
and “it uses the electromagnetic spec­
trum more efficiently.” Also, with the 
new system, “every quarter mile there 
would be a transmitter and receiver,” 
which would improve quality of the 
transmission since the phone auto­
matically switches to the closest trans­
mitter.
Finally, because the new phones 
use a smaller battery, they are itiuch 
smaller. Lightner said the folded ftfione 
is only 51/2 inches long.
Lightner said the preliminary re­
sults of the CMU survey indicate that 
the benefits of the phone were the 
ability to be reached at all times in 
case of a personal or family emer­
gency, the ability to be productive 
while away from the office, and the

Battle marks special session
Student Senate wrestles with election results
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan News Editor
In an angry, two-hour special session 
of Student Senate Thursday night, the 
body decided to override its own election 
rules and disregard the recommenda­
tion of the Election Board to invalidate 
the Student Government elections two 
weeks ago.
The Election Board decided to invali­
date the fall election of senators%ecause 
of a list of write-in candidates that was 
posted at the polling place by a member 
of the Board.
Normally, Student Senate is obligated 
by the election rules to accept the Elec­
tion Board’s decision, and the Board has 
the final say as to who becomes a mem­
ber of the Board. In this case, Senate 
decided to suspend the rules to allow 
new members to be appointed by Senate 
without the approval of the Board.
In addition, Senate decided to have 
the new Board vote on whether or not to 
reconsider the previous vote to invali­
date the election.
Many members of Senate and of the 
audience were angry over alleged mis­
conduct of the Election Board in allow­
ing the list to be placed at the ballot box 
and then invalidating the election be­
cause of it.
Jim Albert, a senior architecture ma­
jor and current chair of the Board, said 
that the group could not decide which 
elections had been affected by the list, or 
how strong that effect was.
“The Election Board could not decide 
when an election would be close or not 
close,” said Albert. “Any decision would 
be arbitrary.”
“We decided to have the entire process 
repeated again,” said Albert, “without 
procedural error, so that anything that 
was tainted by this could not be re-

peated again.”
Albert’s statement was met with deri­
sion by many of the graduate students in 
the audience.
If the elections had been validated by 
the Board and accepted by Senate, gradu­
ate students would have swept the va­
cant seats in virtually every college.
Lara Wolfson, president of the Gradu­
ate Student Organization (GSO), accused 
the Board of “gross misconduct.”
GSO and Senate have been embroiled 
in a battle over the distribution and 
administration of funds from the Gradu­
ate Activities Fee.
Wolfson said that two members of the 
Board were at fault; former Board Chair 
David Martin, for posting the list,, and 
Board member William Motley, for ac­
cusing Wolfson of circling the names of 
graduate students on the list.
“[The Board's] thoughts were tainted 
by William Motley’s misrepresentation 
of fact,” she said.
“It is a blatant lie that I circled the 
names on the list,” said Wolfson. “The 
people on the Election Board should be 
removed from the Board and impeached.”
Wolfson also accused Student Govern­
ment Treasurer Declan McCullagh of 
lying about the circled names on the list 
as well.
Wolfson has since filed charges of slan­
der against Motley and McCullagh with 
the University Disciplinary Committee.
Wolfson said that according to the 
election rules, the Board had to present 
evidence that the elections were invalid, 
and that she had seen no evidence that 
the list of write-ins affected the election 
results.

Americans believe JFK 
murder was covered up
NEW YORK CITY, November 21 
(AP)—Seventy-eight percent ofAmeri- 
cans believe there’s been an official 
cover-up of the John F. Kennedy as­
sassination, according to a new Asso­
ciated Press poll.
Eighty-two percent say they haven’t 
been told the whole truth about the 
case. And only 15 percent accept the 
Warren Commission conclusion: that 
the President was killed 30 years ago 
this Monday by Lee Harvey Oswald, 
acting alone.
More than seven in 10 Americans 
now say Kennedy was killed by a con­
spiracy. That number has been grow­
ing. Fewer than half called it a con­
spiracy in a survey taken 15 years ago.
Thirty-nine percent say they sus­
pect the Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA) or the Mafia was involved in the 
assassination. Twenty-four percent
name the Cuban government; 21 per­
cent say American military leaders, 
and 20 percent pick Lyndon B. 
Johnson, Kennedy’s successor. Poll re­
spondents were told that they could 
choose more than one suspect.
One political writer says that the 
greatest secret surrounding Kennedy 
has nothing to do with sex or the 
assassination. Richard Reeves says 
the President suffered from the fatal 
disease known as Addison’s disease— 
a secret he probably couldn’t hide to­
day. Reeves says Kennedy managed 
to keep his health problems a secret 
despite being in nearly constant pain.
In his book President Kennedy: Pro­
file of Power, Reeves says Kennedy 
took daily injections of painkillers and 
steroids. The author says that one of 
the side effects of the injections was 
increased sexual desire.
Assassination center in 
Texas set to reopen today
DALLAS, Texas, November 21 (AP)
— The mission of the JFK Assassina­
tion Information Center is stated sim­
ply — they want the truth.
The director of the center, which 
features an exhibit, a bookstore, and a 
repository of documents and photos, 
says there are just too many unan­
swered questions aboutPresident John 
F. Kennedy’s death. Larry Howard 
, says everyone deserves to know what 
; happened on November 22,1963, “so
we can all have some peace.”
The center just moved and is now 
three blocks from Dealey Plaza, where 
Kennedy and then Texas Governor 
John Connally were shot. It’s set to 
reopen tomorrow—the 30th anniver­
sary of Kennedy’s slaying.
Howard says the center was the 
major consultant for Oliver Stone’s 
movie JFK. He says he’s gotten tens of 
thousands of petitions to reopen the 
investigation into the assassination.
Packwood said ready to resign in face of pressure
WASHINGTON, November 21 (AP)
— A Senate source says the Ethics 
Committee is expected to ask a judge 
tomorrow to enforce its subpoena for 
Senator Bob Packwood’s (R., Ore.) dia­
ries. A lawyer was on hand to file 
papers Friday, but delayed because of 
talk that the senator was thinking 
about resigning.
Accordingto administration sources, 
the Justice Department has already 
issued a subpoena to Packwood.
The Ethics Committee subpoena 
stems from its sexual misconduct in­
vestigation of Packwood; sources say 
the Justice Department subpoena fo­
cuses on whether Packwood’s actions
on behalf of Japan’s Mitsubishi Elec­
tric Company were tied to a job offer to 
his wife from a lobbyist for Mitsubishi.
The Oregonian newspaper in Port­
land today reports Packwood is pre­
pared to resign, but only if the Justice 
Department backs away from its sub­
poena.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R., Kan.) says that there have been 
only charges, but no proof, so he’d 
rather see Packwood fill out his term.
Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell (D., Maine) said that any 
situation such as Packwood’s is hurt­
ful to a Senate already distrusted by 
the American public.
Senate passes Brady Bill 63-36
WASHINGTON, November 21 (AP)
— Just a day after the Brady Bill had 
been pronounced dead for the year, the 
Senate voted 63-36 to pass it. The vote 
came after senators worked out a com­
promise to end a Republican filibuster.
The bill would impose a five-day wait­
ing period before handgun purchases. 
Under the compromise, the waiting pe­
riod would expire in four years, though 
the attorney general could add a fifth 
year. The waiting period would be re­
placed by a computerized, instant back­
ground check.
The Senate now must work out differ­
ences between its version of the bill and 
the House’s — either in the few days 
before Congress recesses, or next year. 
But Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell (D., Maine) says “there’s no 
doubt that it will become law.”
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R., 
Kan.) says changes made the bill worth 
passing.
Dole, speaking on NBC-TV’s Meet the 
Press, noted that the bill was named 
after — and supported by — former 
Reagan administration press secretary 
James Brady. Brady was shot in the 
head during the assassination attempt 
on President Ronald Reagan in 1981.Strike hasn’t grounded many overseas flights
LONDON, November 21 (AP) — 
American Airlines says overseas service 
is getting closer to normal despite a 
strike by flight attendants.
The extent of the disruption in trans- 
Atlantic service is unclear, but it’s not as 
great as in the U.S. because November is 
one of the slowest months for travel 
between the U.S. and Europe.
Today is the fourth day of a strike by 
flight attendants.
American operates 30 flights a day out 
of Europe. Airline spokesperson Lizann 
Peppard says no passengers have been 
stranded in Europe overnight as a result 
of the strike. She says more and more 
planes are flying each day.Explosion stifles ‘Chunnel’ work
LONDON, November 21 (AP) — An 
electrical accident has halted work on a 
stretch of the Channel Tunnel linking 
Britain and France.
The Sunday Mail newspaper describes 
what happened as an explosion, but the 
company building the tunnel says that’s
exaggerated.
Euro Tunnels says the incident was a 
short circuit on an overhead power line 
and work will be set back only a few 
days.
No one was in the tunnel at the time of 
the accident. Euro Tunnels says even if 
a train had been in the tunnel, no one 
would have been in danger.
The newspaper disputes that. The re­
port suggests the train would have dis­
integrated from the heat of 25,000 
volts and no one would have survived.Labor’s love of Clinton waning; NAFTA is cause
WASHINGTON, November 21 (AP)
— A labor leader warns that President 
Bill Clinton may be in danger of losing 
support on health care and other issues 
because of the rift over the North Ameri­
can Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Labor opposed the free trade pact with 
Mexico and Canada. Thomas Donahue, 
secretaiy-treasureroftheAFL-CIO, says 
the issue “burned very deeply.”
Speaking on NBC-TV’s Meet the Press, 
Donahue said Clinton turned the debate 
into a personal one of accusing labor of 
using roughshod tactics to defeat the 
NAFTA.
Now Donahue says there’s less enthu­
siasm for Clinton’s health care program 
because labor feels let down on the 
NAFTA.
He also says labor may be less excited 
about giving to Democrats, and says 
there’s always the possibility that orga­
nized labor could back someone other 
than a Democrat for President.Man charged with assault on local reporter
VALENCIA, Penn., November 20 (AP)
— A suburban Pittsburgh man has 
pleaded guilty to harassing a television 
reporter who was covering a strip show 
at a fire hall.
Robert Cornelia of Shaler entered 
guilty pleas last week to counts of ha­
rassment and disorderly conduct. 
Charges of simple assault and reckless 
endangerment were dropped.
WPXI-TV reporter Donna Foreman 
says she was nearly run over by 
Cornelia’s car as she waited outside the 
Valencia Volunteer Fire Department in 
Butler County on October 22. Valencia 
firefighters were sponsoring a contro­
versial all-girl revue that night.
Foreman says she had time to jump 
out of the way of Cornelia’s vehicle. A 
WPXI-TV photographer videotaped the 
incident.
Police found Cornelia later at a tav. 
em. He told them that he “did back u 
toward Foreman but was just joking 
around.”Winnie Mandela unhurt by shots fired at car
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, 
November 21 (AP) — Nelson Mandela 
says he doesn’t think his wife was the 
target of a gunman who fired shots into 
her car.
Winnie Mandela’s driver, who a 
functions as her bodyguard, was killed 
as was the assailant. Mandela wasn't 
struck, but reports say she’s beingtreated 
for shock.
Commenting after a political rally to­
day, Nelson Mandela said the incident 
was “regrettable.”
Police say they don’t think the gun­
man was aiming for Winnie Mandela 
who has separated from the African 
National Congress leader.
The shooting followed an argument 
between Mandela’s driver and some pe. 
destrians thronging the roads after a 
street festival.President wraps up California road trip in LA
LOS ANGELES, November 21 (AP)— 
President Bill Clinton spends today in 
Los Angeles, going to church and meet­
ing with victims of Southern California’s 
deadly fall wildfires.
The President is expected at church 
services in Pasadena and a Christmas 
festival at a church in East L.A.
The California visit wraps up a West 
Coast presidential visit featuring a trade 
conference with leaders of Asian and 
Pacific nations.
He also took time last night for a fund­
raiser in San Francisco for U.S. Senator 
Dianne Feinstein.
Feinstein didn’t make it to her own 
event — she was delayed by Senate 
votes on the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) and the Brady gun 
control bill. She had to address the crowd 
by telephone during her flight from 
Washington.

Senate overrides rules
SENATE, from page 1
Dylan Sawyer-Villers, a CIT sena­
tor and a member of the Board, said 
that he knew of a number of specific 
incidents where the write-in list in­
fluenced voters.
Senator Moneet Singh, a fifth-year 
architecture student, called the re­
peal of the election rules in this situ­
ation unethical.
Singh was upset that a number of 
people who were voting on the rules 
suspension were people who stood to 
lose their seats, depending on whether 
or not the results were validated.
“You are extremely unethical, and 
I question your ethics,” said Singh, 
addressing Senate. “This is insulting 
to the body as a whole and to the 
student body at large.”
“If you suspend the election rules 
on this issue, you are setting an ex­
tremely dangerous precedent,” said 
Shawn Knight, a junior physics ma­
jor.
Knight said that now, any time 
thatSenate disagreed with something 
the Board decided, it could suspend 
the rules.
“You are making an extremely dan­
gerous mistake,” said Knight. He 
called the election rules the “most 
important thing on campus ... [that 
candidates] have in their favor.”
“The Election Board has made its 
decision,” said Michael Loomis, an 
economics doctoral student. “It is the 
duty of Student Senate to stand by 
that decision.”
Loomis said that “what we’re see­
ing is a bunch of people with their 
own interests in mind” trying to 
change the rules to suit their own 
purposes.
Senate’s Executive Committee 
(ExComm) decided that the election 
rules were standing rules, and that as 
such, they could be suspended by a 
majority vote of Senate.
However, ExComm recommended 
that the rules not be set aside in this 
case.
After Senate voted to suspend the 
rules 8-7-7, heated debate followed 
as senators attempted to add people 
to the Election Board.
Many questions were raised as to 
the eligibility of various individuals 
to sit on the Election Board. Several 
nominations were turned down be­
cause the nominee was not in the 
room.
The decision of ExComm was that 
only people who had submitted peti­
tions to run for Senate seats were 
ineligible to sit on the Board.
In the end, 11 people were added to 
the list, including Assistant Dean of 
StudentAffairs PatHamedandDean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy, 
as well as Knight and Erik Altmann, 
a computer science doctoral student 
and a long-time foe of GSO.
The Election Board as originally 
constituted had recommended that 
new election be held and the process 
be completely repeated.
New petitions would have had to 
been submitted by November 29 of 
this year and new elections would 
have been held in the spring semes­
ter.
The Board, with the new members 
added, met immediately after the Sen­
ate meeting. No new actions were 
taken by the Board, and the original 
decision to invalidate the elections 
will stand for now.
Emailed threats concern Secret Service
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan News Editor
President Bill Clinton publicized his 
email address to make himself more 
accessible to the American public, but 
apparently, some people have abused 
the privilege.
Campus Police Chief James LaPaglia 
says that there have been two incidents 
where death threats to the President 
and Vice President A1 Gore have been 
sent from Andrew accounts at CMU.
“In the most recent one, someone left
themselves logged in,” says _______
LaPaglia. “A message was sent 
to the White House, threaten­
ing the Vice President of the 
United States.”
The most recent incident was 
a threat to Gore made on No­
vember 16. The previous inci­
dent occurred a short time be­
fore Clinton visited Monaca in 
Beaver County, just north of 
Pittsburgh.
In both incidents, says _____ 
LaPaglia, the Secret Service has 
visited the campus to interview the indi­
viduals. No arrests have been made.
Michael Rostker, a sophomore drama 
major, says that he left himself logged in 
on a machine in Wean Hall on the morn­
ing of September 5.
“The message said, ‘Dear Slick Willie, 
I’m going to fucking kill you, I mean it,’” 
says Rostker. “Then, I got an automatic 
response from the White House.”
Rostker says that the message was 
carbon copied to his account. “[The per­
son responsible] wanted me to know he 
did this,” he says.
Rostker says he found out what had 
happened when he logged in again that 
day to check his mail. He emailed the 
computing services advisor to “cover my
butt,” he says.
He thought about sending a follow-up 
message to the President, but he knew 
“that the Secret Service had already 
read it by that point.”
“We’re not investigating these,” 
LaPaglia says. “Our role in these inves­
tigations is fairly standard... if any law 
enforcement agency comes to campus to 
interview a student, arrest someone, or 
even serve legal papers, we ask them to 
do it through us, to keep the disruption 
to a minimum.”
Rostker says that he received a call
"f think the whole problem is 
that people don't treat email 
with the same respect as ‘snail 
mail.’”
— Michael Rostker, 
sophomore drama major
from the Secret Service several weeks 
later. The agent asked Rostker to meet 
with the Secret Service at Baker Hall 
155, the Campus Police station.
“The Secret Service didn’t care that I 
had left myself logged in,” says Rostker. 
“They wanted to find out who it was 
[that sent the mail].”
“It was a very interesting conversa­
tion, and very informal,” he says. “They 
seemed very concerned that this had 
happened ... He wasn’t giving me the 
third degree.”
A spokesman for the Pittsburgh office 
of the Secret Service said that the office 
could neither confirm or deny that any 
investigation had taken place on the 
CMU campus, nor would he speculate
about whether or not any investigation 
could be launched for such an incident.
Rostker says that he brought a wit­
ness with him to the meeting who could 
vouch for Rostker and say that he was 
not near a computer at the time the 
email was sent. Plus, he says, “I guess I 
didn’t seem like a psychopath that 
wanted attention.”
LaPaglia says that if the Secret Ser­
vice found that threats to the President 
had been made, the individual respon­
sible would likely be subject to internal 
discipline by the University as well as
___________ external prosecution under
federal law.
Leo Dillon, assistant U.S. 
Attorney for Western Penn­
sylvania, says that some­
one found guilty of threat­
ening any harm to the 
President or Vice President 
can be subject to a $250,000 
fine in addition to up to five 
years in prison.
“To threaten the Presi- 
dent or Vice President of 
the United States is an ex­
tremely serious federal violation,” says 
LaPaglia.
“They said they follow up any and all 
threats to the President,” says Rostker.
“Don’t leave your account open,” 
LaPaglia says. Otherwise, you can be 
held accountable for messages emailed 
from your account.
Rostker says that his name was “effec­

“If I leave my stationery out on the

1) F93-6 Plus/Minus Grading. 
Whereas, the faculty senate ap­
proved the adoption of a new grad­
ing system; Considering that the 
results of the Academic Affairs 
Survey showed a response in fa­
vor of a revision of the present 
grading structure; Noting the best 
interests of current students 
would indicate a need to imple­
ment any changes so as not to 
affect the current QPAs ad­
versely; We, the Student Senate 
recommend to the Faculty Sen­
ate that the proposed changes in 
grading structure be imple­
mented in thel994-95 academic 
year for the incoming first year 
students; Recommend that these 
changes not be implemented for 
any current students, and that 
the registrar develop two systems 
for calculating QPA until such 
time that all current students 
have graduated; Further recom­
mend that the Graduate School 
of Industrial Administration and
the Heinz School remain in con­
trol of grading systems within 
the individual departments of 
these colleges. Motion to post­
pone consideration until the next 
meeting on November 30 passed.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 22 November 19935
Bell Atlantic and CMU 
release study results
PHONE, from page 1
ability to use wasted time, such 
as in traffic, in a productive way. 
These results indicate that Bell 
Atlantic was not far off in their 
assessment of the phone’s ben­
efits.
However, there were disadvan­
tages discoveredduringthe study. 
First, the reception of the phone 
: was not always very good.
Michele Colon, administrative 
assistant for the social and deci­
sion sciences department said 
that there was a lot of static in 
the calls, some difficulty hearing 
the other party, and a tendency 
to lose the connection in the 
middle of the call. The phone 
worked in tunnels, though, some­
thing that can’t be said for all 
mobile phones.
Other disadvantages of the 
phone included the tendency to 
forget it, and the lack of real need 
for thé phone for one’s job. The 
; final perceived disadvantage of 
' the phone was responsible for four 
CMU subjects returning their 
! phones before the endofthestudy. 
After seeing the report about 
phone health risks on ABC-TVs 
20120 earlier this year, some 
people are worried that the radio
¦ waves from cellular phones can 
have negative effects on the us­
ers health.
Although Bell Atlantic denied 
that there were any problems 
associated with the phone, one of 
the 100-people surveyed said that 
she could feel her ear get very 
warm after using the phone for a 
long period of time.
Lisa Lightner, one of the four 
who quit the survey said that the 
phone “felt like an invasion of 
privacy because it is always with 
you.” Because of this, and the 
poor reception of the phone, 
Lightner did not feel that the risk 
to her health was worth it.
When the 100 surveyed were 
asked how they viewed their 
phone as a personal line, 69 
percentsaid they viewed it as a 
friend, 23 percent as a servant, 
and 1 percent as a jailor.
When asked how they viewed 
their work phone, 15 percent said 
as a friend, 49 percent as a ser­
vant, and 19 percent as a jailor. 
Professor Weiss said, “Some 
people like the idea of being 
reached all the time, and others 
don’t.”
Bell Atlantic’s understanding 
of the needs of potential custom­
ers is essential to improving their 
product and determining the price 
rates for the products use. The 
CMU study has given them much 
of the information that they need 
to appeal to consumer demand.
Plus/minus grades tabled by Senate
GRADES, from Page 1
make it easier for professors and 
TAs.”
Steinberg told Wallhausen 
that sometimes, instructors 
wanted to give a student a B+, 
because they thought their work 
deserved more than a B, but not 
an A.
The Academic Affairs commit­
tee later took its own survey of 
students and found overwhelm­
ing support for the idea.
“After talking to [Steinberg], 
and seeing what people had to 
say on the survey, we all gradu­
ally came around [to supporting 
it],” said Wallhausen.
Cohen did not feel the Student 
Senate proposal to introduce
plus/minus grading only for in­
coming freshmen was practi­
cable.
“What happens in a shared 
class? GPAs will get skewed, and 
so will competition for summer 
jobs,” said Cohen.
“Berkeley does it with success,” 
Cohen said, “but they have an 
A+, worth 4.3 grade points,” 
which the present proposal does 
not include. “With this system, 
you could have all A minuses 
andnotmakeDean’slist,” which 
requires a 3.75 average in SCS.
Steinberg, a sponsor of the pro­
posal, said that this should be 
determined as appropriate on 
the department level, and that 
this was an area where Student
Senate could make recommen­
dations.
One ofthe advantages of plus/ 
minus grading was given as per­
mitting easier and more fair av­
eraging of grade sequences.
However, Cohen said, “cur­
rently, most professors give the 
A if you go there and weep and 
argue and show that you have 
worked in the class. I think [this 
new system] will significantly 
reduce 4.0s. It might lower the 
overall QPA.”
Cohen emphasised that he 
thought the QPA is a very deter­
mining factor for an undergradu­
ates.
The new possibilities of differ­
entiation would mean an inten­
sification of competition and 
more stress, Cohen said. “CMU 
is stressful enough. People just 
don’t want to fight for another 
tenth of a point.”
Wallhausen said that she felt 
the proposal would pass over­
whelmingly.
“I don’t know if it will pass in 
the format that it is in right 
now,” she said, because some 
senators feel that forcing the 
registrar to maintain two grad­
ing formats will prove 
unwieldly. “I suspect that prob­
ably someone will want to 
change that.”
However, she said that the 
idea itself has wide acceptance 
in Senate.
DoD asked 
to focus 
requests
DOD, from page 1
firm [KPMG Peat Marwick] to 
help us look at ourselves again,” 
he says, “to see if we can find 
anything that might be wrong, so 
that we can be in a position to 
help the investigation. We’re try­
ing to view ourselves from an­
other perspective to see if some­
thing looks unusual.”
Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Dorm public area upgrade planned
Remodeling is scheduled for several public area 
lounges over winter break. For the most part, the 
work will include some combinations of new light­
ing, carpeting, painting and furnishings.
The targeted area for these improvements are 
the Morewood Recreation Room, Welch Lounge, 
Doherty TV Room, and the Henderson Lounge.
There is also an old cluster in Mudge House that 
has not been in use for several years. David Potter,
area co-ordinator for housing, says, “We would like 
to use the old computer room more effectively, but 
we [housing] need more information from Mudge 
residents before we make any decisions”
The bulk of the remodeling will happen over 
winter break and should be completed before stu­
dents arrive for Spring semester. However, Potter 
said that any new furniture ordered will not be 
delivered until late January.

Crime and Incident Report
11/11 MEDICAL CALL ,10:51 
pm. A student living on the sec­
ond floor of Mudge C-Tower said 
that while participating in a “wa­
ter battle” there, she was hit with 
a pitcher of water in her left eye. 
She had swelling above her eye.
She was given an ice pack by 
CMU EMS. She refused further 
assistance or a medical escort.
11/13 MEDICAL ESCORT,
11:55 pm. A resident of More- 
wood Gardens E-Tower called 
Campus Police and asked for 
transportation to Presbyterian- 
’ University Hospital. He was hav­
ing chest pains and his heart was 
racing. He experienced two sepa­
rate episodes and had a third one 
just prior to his arrival at the 
hospital. He said that he had been 
. under a lot of stress lately.
11/13 SUSPICIOUS PER­
SON, 8:11 pm. A man entered 
BH 155 to report a suspicious 
individual in the Gymnasium’s 
weight room. The individual was 
talking about Satan, death,
‘psycho hospitals,’ and the world.
Two officers responded and met 
the individual. He said that he 
didn’t mean to cause any prob­
lems. He had been trying to 
preach and explain the Bible to 
the people in the weight room.
He was asked to leave the Gym 
for the night to prevent any fur­
ther problems, and left without 
incident.
11/14 ATTEMPTED THEFT,
1:10 am. While standing in a park­
ing lot off Frew Street, an officer 
heard a long bang from the front 
of Baker Hall, turned, and saw a 
person look towards Frew and 
then duck behind the building.
Two officers searched for the 
man but no one could be found. A 
check of the area revealed the 
attempted theft of a white moun­
tain bike. The bike was stored in 
BH 155 for safe keeping.
11/14 MEDICAL CALL , 9:19 
pm. Campus Police was notified 
that a person in Doherty Hall 
had cut his finger with an X-Acto
knife and was bleeding. Upon 
arrival, the man had a gauze pad 
and tape on his finger to control 
the bleeding.
After being checked by CMU 
EMS a Band-Aid was applied to 
the finger. A medical escort was 
refused at this time.
11/13 MEDICAL CALL , 6:46 
pm. Campus Police was notified 
that a person had broken his 
ankle after getting it caught in 
Hamburg Hall’s revolving door.
CMU EMS and two officers re­
sponded. The victim was lying at 
the front entrance.
After a preliminary exam by 
CMU EMS, Pittsburgh Paramed­
ics arrived. An ice pack was ap­
plied to the ankle and the man 
was transported by thè paramed­
ics to Presbyterian-University 
Hospital.
The man later told Campus 
Police that while in the middle of 
the revolving door, his left foot 
slipped, causing his right foot to 
get stuck between the door and 
the glass enclosure. He was as­
sisted by several other students 
in getting his foot out.
A check of the revolving door 
found that it was in good working 
order and free of debris.
A maintenance request was 
filed with Physical Plant, and they 
were notified that a glass panel 
had cracked when the man fell 
against the door.
11/13 NOISE , 1:43 am. A resi­
dent of Roselawn Terrace re­
ported that a loud party was un­
derway.
The resident holding the party 
was advised to keep the noise 
down. She was notified that she 
.would be cited if another com­
plaint was received.
Later, another complaint was 
received, and she was issued an 
interal citation for loud noise.
11/13 DOMESTIC VIO­
LENCE, 8:00 pm. A student 
phoned Campus Police to report 
that she was assualted by a per­
son she knows.
The victim was visibly shaken
and nervous when the investi­
gating officers arrived. She said 
that she was at her ex-boyfriend’s 
residence earlier that evening. 
He had become violent toward 
her after finding out that she was 
involved with another man.
Her ex-boyfriend struck her 
face, stomach, chest, and right 
arm. He also cut her hair with 
scissors.
The assault occurred off-cam- 
pus, so Pittsburgh Police were 
notified. The assailant was placed 
under arrest for domestic violence 
by Pittsburgh Police. The victim 
refused medical attention.
11/14 SUSPICIOUS PER­
SON, 7:35 pm. Campus Police 
was notified that a person was 
preaching in the. weight room. 
Two officers responded, and found 
that it was the same man who 
had been asked to leave on No­
vember 13.
Due to the fact that this was 
the second complaint, he was 
notified that if he was stopped 
again, he would be arrested for
defiant trespass.

FORUM
Government secrecy only creates problems
I fli.
1 r*
A committee has recently been 
convened by Student Govern­
ment President David Wolpert 
for the stated purpose of exam­
ining the feasibility of restruc­
turing student government. The 
membership of this committee 
bears a suspicious and some­
what disturbing resemblance to 
the ad hoc committee which re­
cently produced legislation rec­
ommending changing the share 
of the Graduate Activities Fee 
(GAP) received by the Graduate 
Student Organization to 60 per­
cent of the total GAF, on the 
grounds that the GAF was not 
being spent in a manner benefi­
cial to most graduate students. 
This committee, operating in 
secret behind closed doors, ar­
rived at conclusions regarding 
graduate membership in stu­
dent activities that in many 
cases have been proven to be 
inaccurate. Yet, this committee’s 
recommendations were taken 
seriously enough that a resolu­
tion based on its findings was 
rushed through Senate to a 
quick passage. This resolution 
has been the subject, or has 
brought to existence the primary 
subj ects of debate on the Senate 
floor for the past month. Its 
legacy is one of squabbling be­
tween grad students and un­
dergraduates. Accusations of 
unethical behavior and actions 
on the part of many people have 
brought the recent Senate elec­
tion results into question. For a 
piece of legislation produced by 
a body with as little standing as 
the ad hoc committee, the is­
sues it raised have been remark­
ably long-lived.
Though Wolpert has lent his 
stamp to the new committee on 
restructuring student govern­
ment, thereby giving it official 
standing and power, we still 
have some reservations. The 
new committee is made up of 
many of the same people who
of the previous ad hoc commit­
tee. Also, its meetings will also 
be closed, and there is currently 
no rule requiring that the min­
utes of these closed meetings be 
released.
The makeup of the new com­
mittee is unfortunate. Though 
the stated goals of the two com­
mittees are different, the intent 
behind their existences clearly 
remains the same. It is difficult 
to believe that the few new mem­
bers of the committee will be 
able to affect the committee in 
any way further than improv­
ing its public image, so that the 
committee’s membership can 
appear balanced to outsiders.
In addition, while closed meet­
ings are easier to ran than those 
open to the public, absolutely 
no excuse exists for failing to 
keep or release minutes of meet­
ings regarding such an impor­
tant, far-reaching subject as the 
restructuring of our system of

Wolpert and the members of 
his new committee must realize 
that an issue as vital to the 
student body as the restructur­
ing of student government can­
not be taken lightly. Every mem­
ber of the student body should 
be interested in the findings of 
this committee. Let us hope that 
its findings are reached in a 
logical, factual way, and that 
we are kept informed of its 
progress on a regular basis. Our 
student government must re­
member two of its primary re­
sponsibilities: to keep its con­
stituents informed, especially 
with regard to important ac­
tions like restructuring our gov­
ernmental system, and to make 
sensible decisions based on fact, 
not political expediency. There 
can be no excuse for another

mal processes of government,

all work and no play makes 
CMU a dull place. Alumni want

their history, and prospective 
students are attracted to a 
school that rewards its students’ 
hard work with a little fun. But 
Warner Hall is reaping the ben­
efits of Carnival without pay­
ing any of the costs. The admin­
istration should seriously con­
sider covering part ofthe bill for 
Carnival.
onEditor:
I think that there is 
some major confusion 
regarding the 35mm 
projector rumors 
which are floating 
around campus. To quell some of this, I 
would like people to understand that 
any new projectors in DH 2210 probably 
won’t be there until the fall of 1994.
Matt White, the SDC films chair, has 
been pursuing this project rather vehe­
mently. However, no one is really going 
to take the project very seriously until a 
number of important, non-trivial details 
are decided.
The most significant logistical prob­
lem is organizing whatever construction 
would be necessary in the projection 
booth, and insuring that this takes place 
before students return to classes. This, 
of course, requires SDC to know exactly 
what projector they want to buy.
The 16mm projectors currently in use 
are only two years old and were sup­
posed to be fairly decent models. Never­
theless, projectors are complex and we 
are experiencing intermittent sound 
problems in one of them. Fortunately we 
have two, and both are fairly easily 
shipped out for maintenance.
On the other hand, the proposed 35mm 
projector contains used components 
which would be an entirely different 
situation. Once installed, that puppy 
isn’t going anywhere and won’t be run­
ning until someone qualified can make 
repairs.
The 16mm projectors can be handled 
by the projectionist and are frequently 
switched back and forth. With only one 
massive, slightly used 35mm projector, 
we are talking about hassles on a higher 
order of magnitude.
Our experience suggests that we need 
to find as reliable a system as possible to 
accommodate 16 showings a week, and 
this implies a projector which will not be 
cheap. We literally need industrial 
strength.
So here’s the bottom line: money. SDC 
has $20,000. This might cover the pro­
jector. But, the construction I mentioned 
earlier is certain to bring costs up, espe­
cially because Physical Plant may need 
to punch a hole in the roof to vent the hot
projector exhaust. Also, additional con­
struction will be required if the projec­
tion booth requires a 220 volt power line, 
which is likely. Finally, there is the 
additional cost of 35mm films which, 
when you show three a week for 14 
• weeks, becomes significant.
There are other issues as well. So far 
this discussion hasn’t included the cost 
of the surround sound system proposed 
by White, or the problem of splicing the 
35mm film and projecting the large 
35mm reels.
Currently, AB splices all films in the 
AB office. If we switched to 35mm we 
would need new splicers (not cheap), as 
well as a space to splice the film. (You 
may not realize how large a 35mm film 
reel is!) In addition, transporting the 
film from Skibo, where it is delivered, to 
the projection booth in Doherty, is no 
mean feat.
Sure, we could find or buy a dolly to 
drag the reels across campus, but the 
damn things can’t be lifted up and down 
steps by an average person! As is appar­
ent, this is not an easy project to orga­
nize by January 11.
The problems most directly related to 
AB have to do with the size of the 35mm 
projector.
Because the new projector is so large 
and unwieldy, there will not be room for 
the 16mm projector in the booth. Al­
though Friday and Saturday night re­
cent releases are easily found, much of 
the alternative punk/cultural stuff we 
try to show on Thursdays and Sundays 
is unavailable in 35mm format.
The sound system in 2210 belongs to 
AB and we like showing films there. By 
installing a 35mm projector without ex­
ploring more options, we risk losing the 
Thursday and Sunday films program. 
Projecting 16mm films is possible in 
Wean 7500 and Porter 100, but is ex­
tremely undesirable—the acoustics are 
poor, the location is not as convenient, 
and we would have to worry about trash­
ing two lecture halls every weekend in­
stead of one.
One last reason to reconsider the 3 5mm 
projector are the plans for our Univer­
sity Center. The auditorium in that build­
ing will include a projection room with 
plenty of space for a 35mm and 16mm 
projector.
In addition, there is a good chance 
that the school will outfit the audito­
rium with a 35mm projector. SDC might 
spend its money now for a projector, a 
big sound system, and lots of construc­
tion to DH2210, even though CMU might 
be planning to buy one in two and a half 
years.
The big reason for the rush is that the 
money SDC wants to spend is from the 
refund owed to us from AT&T, which 
rightly belongs to the students who used 
Housing last year.
So, if SDC doesn’t spend the money 
soon, those who deserve it will no longer 
be living in campus housing, or even be 
students. When the projector is finally 
installed next fall, two years of students 
who used Housing will be gone.
My point is not to say thatwe shouldn’t 
get 35mm projectors. I just want every­
one to know that the magnitude of the 
proposal is probably too large to accom­
modate within SDC’s timetable.
If the $20,000 is allocated toward a 
35mm projector rather than some other 
improvement project(s), then those who 
earned it may not see the benefit.
P.S. $20,000 would buy one hell of a 
Carnival concert.

Materials ScienceAll animals suffer, deserve respect
Matt Ball
With the holidays approaching, mostofus are preparing to 
take part in traditions that have always been in our lives. 
Many draw comfort and identity from these rituals, and 
don’t want anyone to question or criticize our actions.
As a part of these customs, the killing of turkeys is treated 
with playfulness and fun, with the carcass of the creature 
the centerpiece of our celebrations. We laugh either because 
we are callous or because we don’t want to think about the 
reality of the animal’s life and death.
When confronted with animal exploitation, some people 
ignore the suffering and injustice they create because “life 
will always be unfair.” This is an old argument which many 
have used as an excuse for inaction in the face of past 
tragedies. But we who live a relatively free and comfortable 
life cannot use the amount of suffering in the world as an
excuse to ignore another’s agony, for as Edmund Burke said, 
“All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good people to 
do nothing.”
It offends and upsets most people to hear of violence and 
murder being committed against other people. Yet violence 
and murder committed against other animals is perpetuated 
and defended by almost everyone, not because the animals are 
threatening our job, way of life, or comfort, but because we 
have traditionally enjoyed consuming the animal’s roasted 
corpse. People — even those who consider themselves con­
cerned and caring — rationalize or ignore their contributions 
to the violence created by the senseless slaughter that pr°" 
vides a mere, fleeting taste of flesh.
Many people say the concerns of human animals are exclu­
sively more important than those of non-human animals. Tins 
division seems obvious to them. But this is not a physiologic^1 
or mathematical truth, for other animals suffer the same basic 
pain, fear, hunger, and terror we do. It is simply a prejudice— 
a preference—that allows us to be concerned only with human 
suffering while turning a blind eye to our contributions to 
other suffering.

Mandatory drug testing violates rights
Adam C. Gross
Just about this time of year, you may have noticed 
some of your friends, or yourself, getting a bit panicky. 
No, this isn’t just a result of the traditional end-of- 
semester hassles, it’s due to the fact that those of us 
fortunate enough to be graduating in May are facirig a 
whole new world of worry: finding a job.
Often, applying for a job today means something it 
never has before — submitting oneself to a drug test. 
Now, I imagine that for even the purest amongus, taking 
a drug test cannot be a pleasant experience. Beingforced 
to urinate into a small glass, in the company of a 
stranger, is hardly anyone’s idea of a good time.
But next year, in the name of making sure we’ve all 
been good girls and boys, some 15 million of us will. 
Regardless of how you feel about drugs, and whether or 
not you choose to consume them, you should be con­
cerned about this infringement of your civil liberties. For 
if you allow your boss to force you to pee into a cup, and 
deny you a portion of rights today, you’ve embarked on 
a slippery slope of control and abuse, ultimately result­
ing in loss of privacy in the workplace, the effects of 
which we are seeing on a growing basis.
For example, as common practice, many companies 
read their employees’ electronic mail. And this is per­
fectly legal. Increasingly, they also like to do things like 
listen to phone calls and monitor keystrokes, to make 
sure workers are up to par on performance levels.
One might argue that is this the employers’ right—after 
all, they do you sign your paycheck. But there are several 
reasons why drug testing and similar forms of employee 
monitoring are self-defeating.
First, a full 70 percent of employers’ losses due to drug 
abuse are due to alcohol, not the illegal drugs tested for. 
And I think most would agree with me that drinking 
heavily will make one less productive at work the next 
morning than smoking any amount of pot.
Second, drug tests are by no means 100 percent accu­
rate, and if your test falsely records your urine as contain­
ing, for ex- _________________________________________

caine, you can 
be fired, and 
have no legal 
recourse in 
most states.
So, for no rea­
son other than 
some bad 
chemistry 
performed by
some part-time lab assistant, you can lose your job and 
your reputation.
Finally, and most importantly, is that drug testing 
creates an adversarial relationship between employer and 
employee, a relationship whose foundation is mistrust and 
fear.
This mode of labor relations is hardly the paradigm that 
we need to move into the next century, and that is probably 
why more progressive companies don’t drug test.
So, what can we, as lowly CMU students clamoring to 
reach just the bottom of ladder, do? Simple. I am asking

all graduating seniors that are seeking employment to 
join me in a pledge, a pledge not to work for any 
company that drug tests.
By denying companies access to the most talented 
workers, namely ourselves, we will be sending a cle^ar 
message that companies that use archaic management 
practices will be denied access to the best and brightest 
of the new work force.
Additionally, I ask that the Career Center start 
identifying companies that do drug test in all interview 
announcements, so we as students can make informed

So do your part to help keep this nation free and 
competitive, next time a prospective employer asks you 
to piss in a cup, tell them that you love America too 
much.

The above verse, and the rest of the song for 
that matter, reminds me of how the notion of 
the holidays has changed from generosity and 
celebration to consumption and greed at get­
ting more gifts than others. Instead of revelling 
in real goodwill all year round, treating each 
other courteously, we concentrate the holiday 
spirit into two months, seemingly hoping to get 
it over with and back to the everyday squabble 
oflife.

vation Army bell-ringers stand everywhere, 
collecting money to clothe and feed those more 
needy than the omnipresent shoppers. People
volunteer in shelters and contribute blankets 
and clothing. Food is bought and distributed to 
shelters. We feel good when we give towards 
feeding a poor family, or get a needy child the 
one present they really want.
As well we should! Since time immemorial 
there have always been the haves and the have 
nots. People need good food, adequate clothing, 
and there are always circumstances beyond 
peoples’ control which determine if they have a 
good paying job or not, and whether or not they 
have a home. This is not to say that a homeless 
person with no job should be fed filet mignon 
every day, but rather that unless a person is 
making a conscious decision not to try to work, 
they deserve at least the dignity of not starving 
to death in this wealthy nation of ours.
I think what needs to be looked at is the 
meaning of the holiday season, whether the 
holiday being celebrated is Christian, Jewish, 
Moslem, Pagan or, in my case, a generic “what 
the heck.”

Among the widely varying principles of the 
myriad of faiths that claim him as their founder, 
the principle of charity is often spoken of. Care 
for those who are downtrodden and needy is 
highly valued. Mother Theresa, for example, is 
truly someone whose commitment to the needy 
of the world is one of truly selfless caring. The 
Jewish tradition also speaks highly of alms­
giving. I cannot speak for the Moslem faith, but 
my own set of ethics calls for helping those in

Brady bill will work
ÍUÁ '&//
Ronak Singhal
In 1980, when John Hinckley 
Jr. attempted to assassinate Presi­
dent Ronald Reagan, he severely 
injured James Brady, Reagan’s 
press secretary. Ever since that 
day, Brady and his wife have led 
the crusade for gun control in this 
country. Their ideas have culmi­
nated with a gun control bill, 
known as the Brady Bill, that was 
passed by Senate Saturday night.
As the Brady Bill currently 
stands, it places a five-day wait­
ing period on the purchase of hand­
guns, so that police can check the 
background of the would-be buyer 
to ensure against purchases by 
felons and others. This waiting 
period, however, would end when 
a national computer-check sys­
tem is put into place.
The bill passed the House and 
was caught up in a Republican- 
led filibuster in the Senate until it 
passed Saturday night. Many 
people view gun control as a viola­
tion of the Constitutional right 
“to bear arms,” while others feel 
that gun control will only weaken 
the victims of crimes, not their 
opponents. However, both of these 
arguments, although both some­
what valid, are heavily out­
weighed by the need to clean up 
America’s streets of weapons.
The Brady Bill will probably 
not make a large dent in national 
crime, if it has any effect at all, 
but it is a strong beginning to 
removing weapons from those who 
pose athreatto society. Currently, 
almost anyone can go into a gun
store and buy a weapon. With this 
law, the police would have the au­
thority to disallow the vendor to 
sell a gun to a person, if the buyer 
is a convicted felon.
Obviously, this effect of the law 
cannot be called negative by any 
means. Criminals will have to 
search harder for weapons and the 
supply of them out on the streets 
will dwindle slightly. I realize that 
the majority of criminals do not 
waltz into stores to buy guns; in­
stead, most of them rely on the 
black market. But there are some 
criminals that do buy their weap­
ons fresh off the shelf, and stop­
ping these criminals from gaining 
ready access to the weapons is im­
perative in the fight to decrease 
the alarming crime rate in this 
nation today.
As for the argument that this 
law takes away the Constitutional 
right to bear arms, I have this to 
say: If a person is a law-abiding 
citizen, then the person still main­
tains this right. If people want to 
buy a gun, they may have to wait 
five days, but this slight inconve­
nience should not be viewed as 
losing the right to bear arms. And 
once the national computer sys­
tem is put into place, there will be 
no waiting period necessary, so law- 
abiding American citizens will still 
have access to guns.
The other argument used by crit­
ics of this bill is that it will only 
hurt the victims of crime because 
they would lose immediate access 
to protection, while criminals 
would still be able to buy weapons 
off the black market. But as I just 
stated, this bill will not interfere 
with the purchase of weapons by 
law-abiding citizens; they still can

8The Tartan « Carnegie Mellon • 22 November 1993Use creativity, not alcohol, to relieve stress
_________________________________Michael Herf
Have you ever had a real friend?
Have you ever known someone you could talk to 
for what seemed like minutes, only to find thateight 
or 10 hours had passed? And the next day, you felt 
•that you could pick up where you left off?
Friendships develop from common interests. You 
might talk to one friend about politics, play a sport 
with another, spend time talking about music with 
another one, and get drunk with another one.
Now if we were taking an I.Q. test, I’d ask, 
“Which one of those doesn’t fit with the others?”
I think it is getting drunk. The other three 
examples all show your friend who you are. All too 
often, it seems like the only kind of friends people 
have are the kind that they party with on the 
weekends.
I know the stress level here is high. I know that 
the time out of class and away from the books is 
very limited. I know our student body in general 
sees alcohol as a release from stress.
I know we’re all hiding.
Yeah, sure, you need to get away, but to what? If
people only like you when you’re drunk, who are 
you? If your friends are faces that you recognize, 
but people are whom you really don’t know, why 
don’t you know them?
You don’t have to enjoy the people you’re with. 
You don’t have to hit a very deep level at all, in fact.
Okay, okay. So what if all of your friends drink? 
It’s just a way to enjoy the time 
with them, to let down the old 
inhibitions a little and get rid of 
some tension, right? But you can 
do all of that without any chemi­

They have misplaced their cre­

were six. Maybe it flew off with a kite that broke its 
string and went flying into the air.
People who use social drinking as a substitute for 
developing real relationships are also missing out 
on the opportunity to find out who they really are.

Anyone who says they have to drink to have fun

things are a lot better.
Here’s the deal. The good stuff, when it’s real, is 
a heck of a lot better than the fake stuff. The same 
goes for the bad stuff.

Sometimes it’s hard to accept

everyone’s doing.
It just makes life so much more

for saying that.
Take off your mask, then open 
your eyes, if just for a while. Get to know someone

know them.
The human condition is not naturally dependent 
on beer bottles. It is dependent on other people. 
Who are you, really? Find out.

Holidays not only time for giving
HOLIDAY, from page 7
need whenever I am able.
Herein lies my conundrum. I 
look around during most of the 
year, and those who are needy 
are given very little heed.
Homeless people do not sud­
denly become housed after the 
holiday season, yet for the vast 
majority of the population, the 
level of interest in helping oth­
ers vanishes with their New 
Year’s hangover.
Indeed, the very idea of good 
cheer and kindness evaporates 
soon after the last champagne 
has flowed. “That’s it—I’ve done 
my charitable act for the next 
nine months. I can become 
crabby again!”
Shelters need staff and funds 
every day of the year; however, 
only during the wind-up for the
holidays is much attention paid.
There are those who do work 
all year. These people and orga­
nizations that feed, clothe, and 
house those unfortunates every 
day are those who are truly 
charitable.
Goodwill, Oxfam, the Salva­
tion Army, Care, and other 
charities work ceaselessly to 
bring needed supplies to people 
in need.
Our hypocrisy stinks. It’s as if 
during the holidays we dole out 
enough money and time to as­
suage our consciences, proud of 
the fact that we have helped a 
fellow human being.
Well, it’s not enough to care 
once a year. Charity, whether 
religious or not, is needed year- 
round. Give just a little every 
month to some charity that you
feel worthy of your donations. 
Be nicer, smile, and take things 
in stride instead of snapping 
back.
I predict, however, that most 
people don’t care enough to do 
this. As college students, we 
have focused concerns, and cer­
tainly those are important. But 
developing the habit of caring 
for and being kind to others is 
at least as important.
And to those people who use 
the holiday season as a pana­
cea for their callousness the 
rest of the year, I have but two 
words: Bah, humbug!

Gun bill passes Senate
BILL, from page 7
purchase the weapon of their choice. Still some argue that the five- 
day waiting period hurts those people, such as people being stalked, 
who need weapons for self-defense immediately.
In these cases, it would probably be possible to have a court 
intercede on the behalf of the citizen so that the person could protect 
himself in a desperate situation.
Thus, the Brady Bill will not infringe upon the right to bear arms 
because it still allows law-abiding people to buy guns, and it does not 
hurt the common person who is often the victim of crime because he 
still can purchase the weapon.
The only true effect of this bill is the elimination of gun shops as 
a retail outlet for common criminals. Maybe the only effect will be 
that one life will be saved because a potential murderer could not 
buy a gun. And if that is the only effect of the Brady Bill, it is 
worthwhile implementation.

All animals deserve respect
SUFFERING, from page 6
One cannot make a hierarchy 
of suffering and be attentive to 
only one type. Justice cannot be 
served by division and prejudice.
• We must look to ourselves to 
make a better world. To promote 
justice, the first step must be to 
grant basic respect to the other 
creatures with whom we share 
the world, to realize their desire 
to live, and to appreciate the value 
their existence has outside of how 
they may serve us.
In the everyday choice of what 
we eat, we make a statement of 
our capacity for moral thought 
and ethical action, and in this 
statement, we can make a differ­
ence in the world.
Without going out of our way or 
detracting from other concerns, 
we can boost the cause of justice 
by choosing not to pay someone to 
kill on our behalf, and celebrat­
ing instead a commitment to non­
violence.
It is difficult to imagine a 
greater hypocrisy than saying 
that we are opposed to injustice 
but still contributing to it by eat­
ing animals. George Bernard 
Shaw wrote, “While we ourselves 
are the living graves of murdered 
beasts, how can we expect any 
ideal conditions on this earth?”
It is not a choice between hu­
mans and non-humans. Rather, 
it is a simple decision of whether 
to contribute to suffering or not, 
a question of taking responsibil­
ity for one’s actions and acting 
ethically verses mindlessly ac­
cepting the prejudices of the day 
and perpetuating injustice. Anna 
Sewell wrote in Black Beauty: “If 
we see cruelty or wrong that we 
have the power to stop and do 
nothing, we make ourselves 
sharers in the guilt.”
Somewhere today, an animal 
is being beaten and shocked to 
the killing floor to satisfy 
someone’s hunger for flesh. Some­
where, other animals are living 
cramped, dark, miserable lives, 
awaiting only a screaming, as­
sembly-line death to satisfy 
someone’s greed for flesh.
Gandhi said that the greatness 
of a nation can be judged by the 
way its animals are treated. Isaac 
Bashevis Singer said that in how 
we treat animals, we are all Na­
zis.
If we are to be truly committed 
to justice and a better world, we 
must live ethically and compas­
sionately beyond the philosophy 
“might makes right,” acting as 
the resistance against prejudice 
and inequity.

The BOND PORTFOLIO and EQUITY PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS GROUPS work with Sales, 
Trading and Investment Banking to help Salomon Brothers' clients quantify and implement investment, 
capital raising, hedging, and asset allocation strategies. This work includes the development of new 
theoretical models for securities valuation, statistical analysis of data, and the development of 
customized client presentations.
Quantitative Analysts often act as generalists for up to two years, after which they specialize in one or 
more of the following areas:
• Modeling financial products such as mortgage-backed securities and options
• Portfolio structuring and/or asset allocation
• Analysis integrated with Sales, Trading, or Investment Banking activities
• Analysis of stock and bond market returns and yields
• Analytical systems development.
Qualified candidates will have a B.S. in a quantitative field such as Computer Science, Engineering, 
Finance, Mathematics, Operations Research, or Statistics. Good analytical and computer skills 
(C/Unix preferable) are required. Because so much of the analyst's work involves direct interaction 
with the Firm's clients, strong interpersonal, writing and speaking skills are also important. While a 
background in finance or economics is helpful, we believe that an analyst with exceptionally strong 
quantitative skills can come to a deep understanding of the financial markets.
Training for quantitative analysts includes:
• An introduction to securities analytics
• A period of internship in different quantitative groups
• Immediate hands-on training with professionals working on various projects
• Licensing with the securities industry regulators
• Additional technical training as needed to handle newly assigned tasks.

Men’s basketball battles in Western PA ClassicLoses first two contests of season to Grove City, W&J, Byrne leads offense both games
By LUBOMIR W. KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Sports Editor
Most people assume that a winning 
team needs to get off to a good start right 
at the beginning of the season. So after 
a 0-2 start, how should the men’s bas­
ketball team at Carnegie Mellon Uni­
versity feel about their expectations for 
the season?
“It’s disappointing to lose our first two 
games, but there were some positives. 
Obviously, when you get two losses, the 
negatives outweigh the positives. I think 
the worst thing we can start to do right 
now is panic. We can’t feel that the 
whole season is a wash,” head coach 
Tony Wingen said after Saturday night’s 
77-66 loss to Washington & Jefferson 
College. The game was played as part of 
the two night Western Pennsylvania 
Classic which was held at Washington & 
Jefferson Friday, and at Allegheny Col­
lege on Saturday. On Friday night, the 
team suffered a heartbreaking overtime 
loss to Grove City College 88-86.
. After this slow start, what can Wingen 
do to guide the team back on to the 
winning track?
“We have to come out with more en­
thusiasm at the start of the game. Both 
of these games we came out and got off to 
slow starts ... we weren’t ready to come 
out and play. The emotion hasn’t been 
there, the enthusiasm hasn’t been there.”
Wingen went with a veteran lineup to 
open the season. Seniors Derek Dragisich 
and Matt Reiprish, the team’s co-cap­
tains, started at the forward spots, se­
nior Charlie Connors played center, and 
two more seniors, Mike Hosni and Rony 
Johns were at the guard position.
The strategy early for the Tartans was 
to pass the ball to Connors and Dragisich, 
who scored 10 of CMITs first 12 points.
Grove City countered with Mark 
Timko, who scored nine of his team’s 
first 14 points. Hosni and sophomore
forward Gregg Lass an were strong on 
defense, stealing a number of Grove City 
passes.
Then with about eight left in the half, 
and CMU up 26-25, the Tartans’ de­
fense broke down. Grove City ran off 11
Ronzio, junior guard Steve Athanas, and 
Byrne.
With about 12 minutes remaining, and 
CMU down 63-49, Wingen returned his 
five starters to the game. The rest they 
received on the bench showed, as they 
outscored Grove City 26-12 for the rest 
of the game. Ronzio played most of that 
stretch, and was a defensive force. He 
got a big hand from the team when he 
was substituted for. Reiprish and Hosni 
hit two key three-pointers down the 
stretch to help CMU tie the game at 75 
with just over one minute remaining.
Grove City had a chance to go ahead

unanswered points to go up 36-26.
Both teams traded baskets and the 
half ended 45-36 in favor of Grove City. 
Dragisich led the team with 13 points 
and sophomore Kevin Byrne added nine 
points. Timko had 20 points for Grove 
City.
“We were down by about 12 at half- 
time. We just came out kind of flat, but 
I think we made a great game out of it in 
the second half,” said Connors.
The Tartans were more up to tempo in 
the second half. Wingen instituted whole­
sale substitutions to keep his players 
fresh. Out came the five starters, and in 
went Lassan, sophomore forward Eric

with :30 left on the clock, but Connors 
blocked a shot by Benjamin Davis and 
altered a shot by Timko.
In the overtime session, both squads 
battled back and forth. With four sec­
onds left, it came down to a 10-foot 
jumper made by Grove City guard Jim 
Wherley. A huge uproar ensued when 
CMU tried_to call timeout with :02 re­
maining, but the referees had already 
headed off the court. After some discus­
sion, the Tartans were awarded the 
timeout and set up for their last shot. 
Timko ruined the Tartans’ plans when 
he stole the inbound pass.
On Saturday, the team hoped to re­
bound from this disappointing loss, and 
take their anger out against Washing­
ton & Jefferson. When the Tartans took 
the floor, there was a feeling of déjà vu. 
Again the team was slow out of the gate, 
but managed to stay even with W&J, 
despite being out-rebounded, out- 
hustled, and committing twice as many 
turnovers. What once was a 28-28 tie 
with 3:40 left in the first half, ended up 
37-28 after W&J hit three three-point- 
ers. Connors assessed the team’s first 
half performance. “They killed us on the 
glass in the first half. We should not be 
making the kinds of mistakes we are.”
W&J were the aggressors to start the 
second half, scoring seven straight points 
to increase their lead to 14.
CMU again had to face a double digit 
deficit in the second half for the second 
night in a row. Again, the team battled 
back.
Bryne led the charge with his accu­
racy from the arc, and aggressive physi­
cal play down under the basket. His five 
foot jumper brought the Tartans back to 
within four, 68-64.
Wingen had nothing but praise for 
Bryne. “I thought Kevin Bryne played 
fantastic. These were the best two games 
of his career, his young career. I hope he 
gets some recognition on the all-tourna­
ment team.”
Unfortunately for Bryne and the Tar­
tans, their comeback effort fell short as 
they were outscored 9-2 for the remain­
der of the game. Bryne finished with 18 
points and six rebounds, and Dragisich 
tallied 12 points and three rebounds. 
Connors was held to three shot attempts 
from the field and finished up with eight 
points and six boards. He expressed his 
dismay over his low offensive produc­
tion. “I can’t only get three in a game, but 
I blame myself for not working harder to 
get open.”
Lassan was also praised by Wingen 
for his performance in the game (nine
points, two rebounds). As a relative new­
comer to the Tartans, Lassan explained 
what he thought was the problem with 
the team in its first two starts.
“I just don’t think we’re ready to play. 
The effort was there, but it felt kind of 
empty. It’s not like we wanted to lose, 
just things didn’t seem to click for some 
reason. Defensively, I think we were 
weak,” said Lassan.
Agreed, defense has been one of thp 
team’s weak points so far. Lassan had 
some ideas how to improve it. “We have 
to start communicating and talking to 
each other. Just play a little bit harder 
because we have 10-12 people who can 
all play well. We just have to go all out.*’
Terry Wilkins led the Presidents with 
19 points and five rebounds. Matt 
Johnson added 17 points and nine re­
bounds.
One large statistic which loomed over 
the Tartans was their poor free-throw 
shooting. Against Grove City, the team 
shot 24 out of 35, and 16 out of 25 against 
Washington & Jefferson.
“Our free-throw shooting is definitely 
a concern right now. We weren’t a great 
shooting team on the line last year. Thi$ 
year it’s been a point of emphasis ii} 
practice. Last night was okay, around 69 
percent. Tonight, we were at 64 percent; 
We’ve got to be up around 70 percent,” 
said Wingen.
It is obvious the team is struggling as 
it kicks off the season, but the coacheé 
and players seem to recognize what thé 
problems are, and how they can be solved! 
Wingen truly believes the answer lies in 
the players’ emotional fiber.
“You got to have enthusiasm, you got 
to have emotion, and you’ve got to have 
intensity.” !
The Tartans’ next game is Tuesday 
against Case Western Reserve Univeri 
sity. It is the first home game of the 
season and will be played at 8 pm in 
Skibo Gymnasium.Tartans split swim meet against Case Western Reserve
By CAROLYN SKARADA
Tartan Staffwriter
The men’s'and women’s swim teams competed 
against Case Western Reserve last Saturday, No­
vember 20. In the final results, CMU men’s team 
defeated Case Western with a final score being: 
113 to 85. The women’s team finished with 85 total 
points vs. Case Western’s 111.
“Two years ago they crushed us, but this year we 
crushed them,” sophomore Mike Berty stated after 
the meet. Senior Jeff Berghoff added, “It was a 
revenge factor.” .
Head coach Jim Cutrone was very pleased with 
both the men’s and women’s performances. “This 
was the fourth meet in ten days. We’ve swam well 
through all of them and I’m especially pleased that 
we swam well at the fourth meet, because this 
shows that we will do well on the third day of 
UAA’s.”
Junior Joanne Kievan also made a comment 
about the intense scheduling. “We’re all really 
tired from a string of meets,” Kievan said. But, 
even though the scheduling has been tight this 
season, both teams have been competitive because 
oftheir hard work during demanding practices and 
conditioning. “Practices are a lot harder and the 
team is swimming much faster,” sophomore George 
Schmidt commented during the meet.
One of the highlights of the meet was when Geoff 
Waller, UAA swimmer of the week last week, broke 
a pool record in the 200 I.M. Waller finished with 
a time of 2:01.51, breaking the previous record of 
2:02.99.
Another exciting event to watch was the 200 
breststroke. Don Nelson, swimming for CMU, com­
peted against his younger brother Steve Nelson,
swimming for Qase Western, in lanGs side by side. 
“Steve and I are different types of swimmers. I’m 
faster in free than he is, but he did better than me 
in the 200 breast,” Nelson said.
The meet began with the women’s 400-yard med­
ley relay during which CMU came in third place at 
4:49.78, closely behind the second place team at 
4:44.82. The relay team consisted of junior Joanne 
Kievan, junior captain Dianne Keen, junior Sarah 
Broadley and sophomore Holley Anstatt.
This event was followed by the men’s 400-yard 
medley relay. CMU took first, third and fourth 
places. The first place team consisted of senior 
Benji Keyes, sophomore Matthew Moe, senior co­
captain Anupam Narula, and sophomore Jeff 
Milton.
Senior Denise Fenwick swam exceptionally well 
and placed first in the 200 breaststroke with a time 
of 2:34.62 although, she missed breaking the pool 
record by two tenths of a second. Fenwick also

Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The CMU women’s basketball team 
opened its season by dropping a tough 
one-point game to Muskingum College, 
52-51 on Saturday.
The Tartans had the last shot of the 
Same after pulling down a rebound with
0 seconds left. They called a timeout 
and set up for the last play.
Senior forward/guard Jenny Gretz took 
t ie inbound pass, drove into the lane, 
and dished the ball to freshman center 
Kristen Kupfer, who put up a last-sec­
ond jumper from about eight feet out.
pfer’s shot did not drop, and the Tar- 
ans finished on the short end of the score.
Gretz led the team in scoring with 18 
points, while senior co-captains Jeanine 
Megahan and Mary Moore tied for the 
lead in rebounds with six each. Amy 
Aitken led Muskingum with 14 points 
and eight rebounds.
“I thought it was a pretty good game, 
considering it was our first game,” Gretz 
said. “We still have a lot to do, still. A lot 
of us haven’t played together [before 
this season].”
Neither team could break out in front 
by more than six points, with scoring 
going back and forth. The Tartans trailed 
29-27 at halftime.
One problem the Tartans had was free 
throw shooting. The team had 19 more 
free throws than Muskingum, but could 
not take advantage of them.
“We just didn’t connect at the free 
throw line,” Gretz said. “I think our 
defesne was okay, but we couldn’t really 
convert [on] offense.”
Gretz said the team learned a lot from 
the game.
“We have to work on pressuring the 
point guard,” she said. Freshman point 
guard Penny Summerville “seems to be 
flustered by that.”
However, Gretz said Summerville is a 
valuable addition to the team.
“It was a good call [by head coach Gerri 
Seidl to start Summerville],” she said. 
“Starting Penny is good. She’s a very 
good ball handler, and she knows the 
game.”
Summerville and Kupfer both cracked 
the starting lineup as rookies, opening
alongside veterans Gretz, Megahan, and 
Moore. Summerville plays the point, 
Gretz the off-guard, Megahan and Moore 
are the forwards, and Kupfer is in the 
pivot.
The Tartans return to action on Tues­
day at home against Case Western Re­
serve University. The game is at 6 pm in 
Skibo Gymnasium.
Thanksgiving weekend, the school 
hosts the Carnegie Mellon tournament, 
with CMU, John Carroll University, 
Allegheny College, and King’s College 
competing on November 27-28.
The squad then hosts Washington & 
Jefferson College on November 30, be­
fore taking to the road for four straight 
games. On December 3, the team travels 
to Atlanta to take on UAA rival Emory.
came in first place in the 200 free event. In the 200 
fly she placed second which was especially good 
considering this was an event she normally doesn’t 
swim. Sophomore Rebecca Fruehan came in first 
place in the 200 I.M. and also in the 100 free.
Captain of the women’s team, junior Dianne 
Keen, is anticipating a successful season. “The 
women’s team looks very strong this year. Al­
though we’re short on numbers, we’ve got some 
new additions that are really going to blow people 
away.”
One of the new additions she is referring to is 
Ilania Kaplan, who has proved to be a major asset 
for the team. In the 500 free, she came in first place

Hockey club braves fog, 
melted ice to defeat IUP
By KYMBERLY BARTLO
Tartan Staffwriter
Beset by problems from the first moment on the ice, CMU Ice 
Hockey Club overcame the odds to win against Indiana University 
of Pennsylvania (IUP) 4-3 in a home game at Monroeville.
Unseasonably warm weather was the main culprit of a problem- 
ridden game. The ice was mushy and a fog hung in the rink, keeping 
visibility at a minimum.
It wasn’t enough that both teams skated onto the ice for the first 
period wearing similar white jerseys, made all the more indistin­
guishable by the mist. After a few 
minutes of jumbled passes and 
confused referee calls, the Tar­
tans put on their black jerseys.
CMU scored three times in the 
first period against IUP goalie 
Kyle Shaffer. Junior left wing Phil 
Beck scored the first goal of the 
night for CMU. Sophomore cen­
ter Roger Maddalena scored the 
second goal, assisted by Beck and 
grad student team captain and 
right wing Dave Umland.
Seconds later, CMU scored 
again as graduate student Dave 
Collins sent the puck into IUP 
net from across the zone, assisted 
by junior defenseman Greg 
Jessop. CMU quickly established 
a comfortable lead, despite the 
poor playing conditions.
Ian Wissinger scored for IUP at 
the end of the first period, but 
CMU graduate student Scott 
Berry held off all other scoring 
attempts.
Two penalties were handed out 
in the first period to CMU play­
ers: junior Constantine Davides 
for roughing and Jessop for trip­
ping. CMUs defense did not al­
low IUP to score on either power 
play.
The second period began with 
both teams playing aggressively and ended with near instances of 
one-on-one combat. The strategy of the second period, adopted by 
both teams, consisted more of knocking the other player on the ice 
than of getting the puck—understandable considering the puck was
•arely visible through the fog. Junior defenseman P. J. Mann and 
, senior defenseman Chris Adukaitis played a strong defensive game,
! and only one IUP goal slid into the CMU net in the second period.
I. “I couldn’t see anything past the blue line,” Berry said. “I think the 
! horrible condition of the ice made our defense concentrate even 
j more.” The offense had two breakaways but failed to capitalize on 
I either one. CMU had eight other scoring attempts on IUP, but failed 
| to score. Frustration with lack of visibility and soft ice peaked in the 
second period. Both teams received numerous penalties, but even 
more went uncalled and unseen by the referees because of the fog.
Maddalena incurred a 10-minute penalty for a cross check from 
: behind. “I was moving up to check the guy, but I didn’t hit him too 
!' hard because it was from behind. When he went down, his stick 
. somehow went up against the boards and cut me across the throat.
I was mad so I threw the stick over the boards. I shouldn’t have, but
I was frustrated.”
Another misfortune fell on CMU as Beck was helped off the ice 
with a bruised elbow. He sat out the remainder of the game.
The second period ended 3-2 with CMU carrying the slim lead. 
The break between periods helped to clear out the mist tempo­
rarily, and also, cool off tempers.
The third period was a nonstop battle for the puck. Each team was 
desperate to put another point on the scoreboard.
Minutes into the third period, IUP’s Ted Brooks scored, evening up 
the game. CMU defense did not falter, however, and their efforts
were equaled by the offense.
Accurate passing and numer­
ous shots on the goal displayed 
CMU’s determination to win. Al­
though the rink fogged up quickly, 
even thicker than before, CMU 
focused their energy on winning 
the game.
Graduate student defenseman 
Tom Sullivan took a hit that sent 
him into the air, but he jumped 
up as soon as he hit the ice, racing 
after the puck.
CMU’s Tom Collins received 
two penalties for rough play and 
tripping. IUPreceivedtwo penal­
ties for rough play and high stick­
ing. Neither team scored on the 
power play opportunities.
Umland scored for CMU with 
four minutes left in the third, 
breaking the tie. He was assisted 
by Davides and Maddalena.
With 1:30 left in the game, IUP 
called a time-out. Tension was 
palpable as players resumed the 
game, IUP having very little time 
left to win the game.
Berry made two great saves, 
but CMU was unable to clear the 
puck out of their zone. Neverthe­
less, the Tartan defense contin­
ued to hold off IUP’s scoring op- 
Gabrien Symons/Tartan Art Staff portunities. With 27 seconds re­
maining, CMU called a time-out.
The last moments of the game were nerve-wracking, but the 
buzzer ended the game with CMU as the winners, 4—3.
Referee Larry Montebell said, “The mist slowed the game down a 
lot. It was difficult to make longer passes, and it was definitely 
harder to call plays. It was probably hardest on the goalies, though.” 
Kicking the legs of a table, defeated IUP player Tom Grenall said, 
“We had too many mental lapses. Fatigue and a lack of cohesiveness 
killed us as a team.”
Both teams played a very close game under tough conditions. 
“Each player was probably 20 pounds heavier from water by the end 
of the game,” Berry said.
CMU was coming off a Saturday night win 10-8 against the 
Pittsburgh Stars in an exhibition home game.
After semester break, they resume play on January 14 when they 
travel to Ohio to go up against Bowling Green State University, 
which has a strong Division I hockey program that has turned out a 
number of National Hockey League players.

Who are those guys playing volleyball on the cut? It’s the men’s 
volleyball club, headed by sophomore president Chris Rotelli and 
senior vice president John Borger. The club will be opening their 
indoor season on December 4, at a tournament held in Grove City.
‘We have a really young team right now. This is going to be a 
building season for the years to come,” junior outside hitter Walt 
Miller said. There has been an enormous amount of restructuring for 
Me club this year. However, “practices are running smoothly now,” 
Miller added.
The traveling team currently includes ten players, an adequate 
number for a volleyball team. The six returning players, aside from 
outside hitters Borger, Miller, and Rotelli, include sophomores Hob 
^aimon as starting setter, Justin LaPaglia as middle hitter, and 
senior Ed Pyo as weak side hitter. Gannon and sophomore backup

Cheering for the 
Cheerleaders
By RICH KWIATKOWSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
At every home football game, 
two Tartan teams show up at 
Gesling Stadium. One team is 
there to compete on the field, 
while the other team is there to 
get the crowd excited during the 
game. Sounds easy, do a couple of 
cheers and go home. The cheer­
leaders, however, work very hard 
and put up with the same weather 
conditions as the players. They 
are also very dedicated and want 
to make the games better for the 
fans and players.
During the football season, the 
squad practices twice a week. 
These sessions are used to prac­
tice cheers, develop new routines 
and help other members learn 
routines.
“The squad develops the cheer 
and we work it out during prac­
tice. This group interacts well, 
there is no real power structure. 
All members teach and help out 
the other members. This is the 
best group I have had, as interac­
tion goes,” said Susan Javorski, 
the cheerleader advisor.
Javorski works for the CMU 
Registrar’s office, and has been 
advising the cheerleaders for four 
years. Javorski, a cheerleader in 
college, answered a job posting to 
take over the squad.
“I wanted to be involved in a 
different capacity than the 
Registrar’s Office. At the 
Registrar’s office I deal with stu­
dents’ problems, this is a more 
refreshing atmosphere,” said 
Javorski.
The squad consists of seven 
women and two men. Rebecca 
Harvey, a sophomore chemical 
engineering/EPP double major, 
is the co-captain this year. Harvey 
started cheering last year after 
she never cheered in high school. 
Her background is in competitive 
marching at Yough High School 
in Western Pennsylvania, and as 
a certified aerobics instructor.
“Cheerleading gave me a 
chance to be involved in some­
thing, to be a part of campus life,” 
said Harvey.
There are three seniors on the 
squad. Dorothy Canepari, a biol­
ogy/technical writing double ma­
jor, is in her first year on the 
squad. She says it looked like fun 
and liked the aspect of meeting 
different people.
“Attendance has to do with the 
weather. Many people are in 
dorms watching so that makes 
the crowd seems smaller,” said 
Canepari.
Manisha Hasija is finishing her
second year on the squad. Hasija, 
a senior IM major, cheered all 
through high school, and missed 
cheering her first two years at 
CMU.
“I missed cheering my fresh­
man and sophomore year until I 
met someone who convinced me 
to try out,” said Hasija.
The last senior on the squad is 
Laurie Yano, a biology/technical 
writing double major. Yano 
cheered in high school and says 
that cheering is a great way to get 
in shape.
“We have postered before and. 
painted the fence to get people to 
the games. The best way is to tell 
people there are games,” said 
Yano.
The rest of the cheerleaders 
are: freshman IM/GCM major 
Esther Jimenez, sophomore ma­
terial science and engineering 
major Stacey Gabor, sophomore 
information and decision sciences 
major Lynne Simons, sophomore 
IM major Jamie Mason, and Hiro 
Kanaya, a sophomore electrical 
and computer engineering ma­
jor.
A big issue facing the squad is ' 
recruiting new members. To try; 
out for the squad one must be a1 
full time CMU student who isn’t 
on academic probation. Tryouts; 
are held during the beginning of 
the fall semester. The prospec­
tive cheerleaders are judged on 
cheers, jumps, stunts and ere-, 
ativity. The squad sets up a table 
at the Activities Fair to attract 
new members and is going to try: 
to get letters out to freshman and 
be represented during Orienta­
tion Week.
“I saw the table at the activities 
fair and talked to Rebecca. She 
convinced me to try out and 
worked separately with me, and I 
made the squad,” said Jiminez.
“Since I had knee surgery, I 
couldn’t play football, and this is 
a great way to stay with school ;• 
spirit,” said Mason.
Kanaya is ranked fourth in the j 
state in gymnastics and says that \ 
cheering is a good way to keep up j 
with his gymnastics.
The other major issue that the J 
squad pays attention to is attend J 
dance at home games. CMU ii i 
notorious for somewhat sparse; 
attendance at sporting events:; 
The cheerleaders have done a! 
good job to promote and excite j 
people about the games.
“We are trying to put signs up j 
and spread the word about the | 
squad,” said Gabor.
The squad has room for eight { 
women and eight men, and will!

Dolphins are still best in AFC
Quarterback Sneak
by John Weber
This is the final edition of Quarter­
back Sneak for 1993. So dry your eyes 
while we take a look at exactly who is 
bound for the playoffs.
In the AFC, the best team to this point 
is the Miami Dolphins. Despite the fact 
that they have lost Dan Marino and now 
are without Scott Mitchell for a couple of 
weeks, they are tied with the Bills at 7-
2 and have also defeated the Bills. After 
the Dolphins come the Bills, Steelers, 
and Chiefs. The Chiefs must rely on 
Montana to get them to the Super Bowl, 
but they are playing well enough with­
out him to win the West and go to the 
playoffs. Overall, barring injuries, the 
Steelers, Dolphins, and Bills are the 
most complete teams in the AFC and 
have the best chance to go to the Super 
Bowl.
Predictions: The Bills will win the 
¦East by defeating Miami in December, 
the Chiefs will hold on to win the West, 
and the Steelers will beat the Oilers in 
December to win the Central Division. 
The Wild Card teams will include Den­
ver, Houston, and the N.Y. Jets. The 
only other possibility is the Raiders, who 
host Denver the last week of the season 
(the Browns “cut” their playoff chances a 
couple of weeks ago).
On the road, in the playoffs, Denver 
doesn’t stand a chance, but the Jets 
could make the playoffs interesting. The 
Dolphins won’t go too far without a quar­
terback, but the Chiefs may make a run 
•forthe Super Bowl ifMontanais healthy. 
•However, the end result should be a 
championship game between the Bills 
and the Steelers. The Steelers have their 
best chance to get to the Super Bowl if
they get home field advantage through 
the playoffs (like last year). The Steelers 
can’t play on grass, so home field advan­
tage means they will play on turfthrough 
the playoffs (and the Super Bowl, which 
is in the Georgia Dome). If the Steelers 
have to win a playoff game in Buffalo 
(with all their fans), they probably won’t 
be going to the Super Bowl.
In the NFC, the Cowboys are by far the 
favorites to go to the Super Bowl. How­
ever, since nothing is ever certain, let’s 
take a look at who will be joining the 
Cowboys in the playoffs.
The Giants remind me of the Steelers 
of last year. This team has been away 
from success for a while and it doesn’t 
quite know how to handle it. The Lions 
are an underrated team this season. The 
“experts” contend that the Lions don’t 
stand a chance, and that (like two years 
ago) they are 7-2 because they have a 
fifth place schedule.
However, I think if they can finish 
ahead of Dallas and get home field ad­
vantage, they have an honest chance at 
the Super Bowl.
Predictions: The Cowboys will win the 
East, the Lions will win the Central, and 
the 49ers will win the West. The Saints, 
Giants, and Packers are the most likely 
wildcard teams. The Saints will keep 
their playoff losing streak alive, and the 
Giants probably won’t go far.
The Packers’ offense might take them 
to the second round, but that’s about it. 
This leaves the Lions, 49ers, and Cow­
boys. If the Lions don’t finish with the 
best record in the NFC, the Champion­
ship Game will be a rematch of last year. 
However, if the Lions do finish with the 
best record, Dallas and the 49ers will 
probably have to play each other a week 
earlier. When it all boils down, however, 
the Cowboys are the favorites to go back 
to the Super Bowl.
I was three for five in Week 11, and am 
currently 34-21 for the season. But 
enough about me, let’s get to the “Team 
of the Week,” the Pittsburgh Steelers. If 
you were chained up in a South Ameri­
can prison last week, you probably didn’t
see the Steelers beat the Bills 23-0.
The Steelers displayed total physical 
domination on both offense and defense. 
The Steelers did what they were sup­
posed to — no turnovers. However, the 
Steelers also banged the Bills up a little. 
The Steelers lost Barry Foster, but the 
Bills lost their quarterback and both 
wide receivers (along with a couple de­
fensive players). They have always 
bounced back from a loss, and this will 
be no exception. The Bills are now wait­
ing for a rematch with the Steelers in the 
playoffs.
The Browns continue to fall as they 
lost to the Seahawks 22-5. The Seahawks 
had a field day as the Browns turned the 
ball over seven times.
The Browns (and especially their 
coach) get the “Bosworth Award.” Since 
this is the last 1993 Quarterback Sneak 
article of the semester, Bill Belichick 
can hold onto the award until next year. 
I think this whole Belichick deal was 
summed up best by the Dallas fans last 
week who held a banner reading: “Beavis 
and Belichick.”
Don Shula captured his 325th NFL 
victory with a win over the Eagles, 19-
14. Although the game was pretty bor­
ing, the celebration afterward was not. 
The Vikings, behind quarterback Sean 
Salisbury, rallied to beat the Broncos 
26-23.
The Chiefs put 31 points on the board 
to beat the Raiders, and John Carney’s 
missed field goal allowed the Bears to 
beat the Chargers 16-13.
The Saints allowed Sterling Sharpe 
deep into their secondary with less than 
a minute left. His catch led to a field goal 
and a 19-17 victory for the Packers. The 
Jets beat the Colts 31—17, the Falcons 
beat the Rams 13-0, and the Cowboys 
held off the Cardinals 20-15.
Finally, in the “not even close” cat­
egory, the Giants beat the Redskins 20-
6, the 49ers beat the Buccaneers 45-21 
and the Oilers beat the Bengals 38—3.
John Weber is a junior civil engineer­
ing major.

“We have a good core, but we’re not extremely deep. We’ve always been 
competitive in the past, finishing with a 5-3 record last year, but it’s difficult

several indoor, six-man tournaments during the winter season.
An outdoor tournament in the spring is also a possibility. The tournaments 
will be open to everyone, which will help to get the entire campus involved.
When the weather is nice, outdoor ball on the cut is the preferred option to 
the gym, for many of the players. “I’d rather play out on the grass or sand any 
day,” Miller claimed. The volleyball club has already hosted doubles tourna­
ments on the cut during the first weekends of the semester, mainly to raise 
money, but also just as an opportunity to play.
Volleyball t-shirts, designed by senior John Ferris, were awarded as some 
of the prizes to the winning double teams in the tournament.

WI mo be right back. I mo take the hose over

Mary, the pretty redhead from Enola. Mary 
kisses him back. He is a sweet helpful man, 
she thinks.
Don’t take forever, she says.
Wouldn't dream of it1, he says. Daniel, the 
tall quiet fellow from Marysville disappears 
into the garage and out the back door. Behind 
the veil of billowy window curtains, she 
watches as Daniel trots across the road 
hurriedly, just ahead of a noisy Beetle.
Mary smiles.
The door to the neighbor's house is opened. A slender arm reaches 
for the green coiled hose. Mary's smile evaporates. Daniel's head 
and torso disappear behind a thick gold-framed door.
Mary trusts Daniel, but she wants to check. She does. Below Daniel's Black & Decker 
Home WoodCraftsman Set, sits a nozzle rusting stupidly in a pool of mucky laundry water.
The front door shuts without it's typical authority as if the inner vacuum of the house struggles against the shutting force.

*Don't look like he's coming back too much, too soon'. Her dainty footsteps travel up and 
through the dusty-orange carpeted hallways. Mary finds Daniel sitting on the living room 
sofa, the remote in his hand. Daniel points the remote at a blank-faced tube. His 
forearms are tense from pressing.
'"Damn remote,0 he says. Mary turns a bulky knob in the corner of the television. The 
television sputters from a wavy glob in the center to an astigmatic frame. Mary 
begins to cry.

"Yeah? Well,
I.turned, bored, and stared 
at something down the road 
which alternated between blurred 
and clear with cinematic precision. 
Hardly distinguished from the 
thickening background of trees, 
it rose, confused above the 
asphalt and tangled amidst 
random silhouettes. I am not 
sure why I noticed. I couldn't 
tell if it was moving and didn't 
care if it did. It eventually 
slipped from sight.
This night sucked. A warm bottle 
between my legs marked the 
big let down. I knew from before 
that there was nothing in this 
village, but still I went out 
to play. I felt like a decaying 
dog. I was forced in old age 
to amuse myself with a faded 
ball burst from vehement chewing 
or some similar toy that my 
master meant to spoil his young 
pet with. I had come to accept 
too much, even sadness.
There had to be. someone in 
this town feeling as bored, 
as bewildered and frustrated 
by the grip of death that held 
the county so low after sunset. 
Where were the living? I was 
always trying, it seemed, to 
spark hope in my friends. I 
didn't know that they had given 
up finding the ghost. I never 
realized that these trips out 
were for amusement. I would 
have to return home from school 
years later to find out.
"I thought you said there was 
a party around here?"
"Keep driving, maybe its further 
down. I can't remember if she 
said 2 or 6 miles."
"We're no where, man, with 
the emphasis on 'no'. Even 
if there is a party, all the 
beer is gonna be gone by the 
time we find it."
No body. No thing.
"Maybe, you're right, I'm getting 
tired of looking at the woods, 
anyway."
Long silence. No sound.
"Shit... well, swing by Landhope.
I'll ask if anyone knows what's 
up. "
No answer. Except, that is, 
for the numbing dance of blinding 
headlights to the humming of 
toxic exhaust.

Lectures provide insight from experts
SPIC-MACAY 
sponsors concert
By LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Features Editor
; On Friday November 19, the Society for the 
Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Cul­
ture among Youth, (SPIC-MACAY,) sponsored 
a concert by Imrat Khan and his son 
Shafaatullah Khan to a full crowd at Mellon 
Institute Auditorium. The music, although 
Vie 11 known to many of the 350 people who
Attended, was an experience for those who had 
Sever heard such music before.
' Imrat played the sitar, a stringed instru­
ment, while Shafaatullah accompanied him
on the tabla, a Hindustani percussion instru-
fient. This style of music originated in the
Moghul Empire of North India around the 
16th century. The style is very traditional and 
ritualized, passed from father to son every
generation. Each family has their own par­
ticular style of music, known as the family’s
gharana.
Imrat himself is a descendant of a famous
family of musicians of Emperor Akbar’s court. 
The sitar was modified by Imrat’s great-grand­
father into a new bass-sitar called a surbahar.
As far as the instrument is concerned, Imrat
is considered one of the best performers of
sitar in the world. His son holds the honor of
being the only musician alive who can play the
sitar, surbahar, and the tabla.
The concert, lasting nearly three hours,
mainly consisted of 40 minute to one hour
compositions where Imrat would set the mood
and melody slowly on the sitar, then, after 15
minutes or so, Shafaatullah would add percus­
sion with his tabla. Then the tempo would
build until finally reaching cresendo. With
each piece lasting so long, Imrat and his son 
only had time to play four songs.
After playing for two hours, Imrat and his 
son took a break from their instruments and 
entertained questions from the audience. They 
explained the different styles of rhythm (taal) 
and melody (rag) embedded in Hindustani 
: classical music to the diverse audience. This 
way, many of the newcomers could clarify 
questions and doubts they had regarding the 
music, the instruments, and the history of the 
music itself. Many asked for specific details 
concerning the difference between Western 
classical and Indian classical music.
Volunteers for the event were very excited 
by the huge turnout. They endured prolonged 
planning to find the right performer who could 
play music but also provide an adequate lec­
ture on the history and style of the music itself.
“Imrat is an excellent teacher and performer,” 
says Krishnan Viswanath, chemical engineer­
ing doctoral student and SPIC-MACAY volun- 
( teer. “Our [SPIC-MACAYs] objective is to 
publicize Hindustani classical music, and 
Imrat was fabulous ... we were all quite im­
pressed by the success of this concert and hope 
to arrange more of such events in the near 
1 future.”
The SPIC-MACAY chapter in Pittsburgh is 
°ne of 30 in the United States. They are partly 
Guided by GSO. All of the organization’s events 
I are free of charge. SPIC-MACAY has orga­
nized seven similar events, with Imrat’s per­
formance the most publicized and discussed 
thus far.
Internet involves many
By TONYA RADO
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
A Carnegie Mellon University under­
graduate and graduate project ad­
dresses the resulting issues of intro­
ducing the Internet, a worldwide 
method of communication, into the kin­
dergarten through grade 12 educational 
environment. The students working on 
the project come from various fields of 
study: the De­
partment of 
Engineering 
and Public 
Policy, the 
Heinz School, 
and the Col­
lege of Hu­
manities and 
Social Sci­
ences. The 
project group 
will present an 
event,
“Internet in the Schools,” on Thursday 
December 2,1993 from 2:30-5 pm in the 
WherrettRoom ofSkibo Hall. The pre­
sentation is free and open to the public.
The event will focus on four main 
topics of interest: educational uses of 
the Internet featuring the uses, charac­
teristics, different effects, and teaching 
styles of the Internet once it was in­
stalled in public schools; a case study of 
a single school with Internet access 
highlighting the results of implement- 
ingthe Internet in schools; professional 
development of educators using the 
Internet and the specific training in­
volved to use it; and acceptable uses of 
policy considerations of the Internet 
functioning as a new media of commu­
nication. This Pittsburgh project is in
joint cooperation with the Pittsburgh 
Public School System, the University 
of Pittsburgh Learning Research and 
Development Center (LDRC), and is 
funded by the National Science Foun­
dation.
“Itis an institution focusing on what 
could go wrongwith the Internet and 
what to do to correct the problems,” 
said William Yurcik, project student 
manager. The project focuses on the 
important 
points of 
consider­
ation in the 
Internet 
model and 
recommen­
dations on 
ways to im­
prove the 
system. 
“There are 
a lot of 
people in­
terested in this discussion—I’m very 
exited about this,” Yurcik said. “Like 
the telephone, it’s a very convenient 
method of communication.”
A reception will be held following 
the presentation. A review panel of 
distinguished educators and Internet 
professionals of the Pittsburgh pub­
lic school system and people inter­
ested nationwide will provide discus­
sion of the results of the Internet thus 
far and exhibit the latest Internet 
videos. For those interested in the 
results of “Internet in the Schools” 
but are unable to attend may obtain 
a detailed report of the panel discus­
sion available in the Department of 
Environment and Public Policy or 
access a copy over the Internet.
"There are a lot of people 
interested in this discus­
sion — I’m very exited 
about this. ”

project student manager

Bernstein addresses objectivity
By ZHUOHAN CAI
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
“Never sacrifice yourself to God or for others,” Dr. Andrew Bernstein, 
associate professor at Pace University, told a packed lecture theatre in 
Doherty Hall. This, according to Berstein, was one ideal he hopes to see 
realized in a objectivist society. Invited by the CMU Students of Objectivism 
and the Political Speakers Forum Board, Bernstein spoke at length about 
how objectivist philosophy is concretized in Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead.
But what really is objectivism? Objectivism is a philosophy set against the 
Democratic outspread of the government, and a plea towards the laissez- 
faire of the government of the past. Objectivism is a philosophy which holds 
that reality is objective (hence the name); that there does not exist any type 
of subjective truth, in which a person’s beliefs, fears, or hopes can corrupt. 
Objectivism is a belief in the rationality of man, belief that reason, not 
emotion nor even intuition, is the sole force behind all of man’s actions, the 
sole impetus which motivates man’s psyche.
The Fountainhead is Rand’s portrayal of four men. They represent figures 
in our---------------------------------------------------------------------------world.

tions.
Howard Rourke, the protagonist of the novel, personifies Rand’s philoso­
phy. He lives bya personal code of values and morals, beholden to none but 
himself.
Paul Keating abnegates his human responsibility of living by his- own 
judgement and allows his life to be dominated by others. In the technical 
terms of The Fountainhead, this is the essence of second handedness.
A person who does not live in accordance with his judgement, values and 
standards but lives in order to impress others, lives second hand, placing his 
goal in others.
“The second-hander’s soul carries a ‘For Sale’ sign on every personal item 
it owns. Every first-hand value will be betrayed to meet the expectations of

Neurotic Living
By Andrew Sproule
Throughout my life, I have met 
many people that have loved me 
and whom I have loved. And I 
don’t mean just romantic rela­
tionships, I’m talking about 
friends, family, and the romantic 
relationships. However, I consis­
tently manage to hurt a family 
member in some way.
You may be wondering why I 
am bringing this up here rather 
than in a more appropriate fo­
rum, such as a psychiatrist’s of­
fice. Well I’m not really sure, ex­
cept this has been on my mind. 
See, my brother’s birthday was 
on November 6. Guess who still 
hasn’t sent him a card or even 
called him yet. Yes, you are cor­
rect in assuming that it is me. I 
don’t think that my brother is 
going to stop loving me, but I do 
think that he is probably a little 
hurt—especially since I forget it 
consistently every year. Of course, 
I could call him and ask — naah, 
too easy. I think I’ll sit around a 
little more, wallowing in self-
berating angst.
Let me tell you a little bit about 
him and maybe you’ll understand 
why I do worry about him not 
loving me anymore. The situa­
tion stems from my very early 
childhood.
One of my first 
memories in child­
hood is with my 
brother, Dave. My 
mother worked quite 
a bit, and so Dave 
used to have to 
babysit me. One day 
while he was 
babysitting, I was sit­
ting in front of the 
television set, mind­
ing my own business, 
when I heard Dave 
call my name. In my 
naive childhood inno­
cence, I looked toward 
the voice that I 
trusted and admired.
Dave was walking out 
of the kitchen with a 
knife the size of a 
machete that was 
pointed at me as 
though we were audi­
tioning for a part mPsycho—me, 
the wo-man in the shower and 
he, Norman Bates. Haha, good 
one Dave. I think, in order to 
keep me from telling Mom, he 
had to give me his beach ball that 
I had coveted for a long time.
There was also the time when 
Dave somehow got delegated the 
task of feeding me breakfast. I 
believe our eldest brother, Rob, 
who in childhood resembled in 
character a bad-tempered 
Ghengis Khan, made him do it.
remember what he had to give 
me to silence me that time, but I 
am pretty positive that I gained 
in some material aspect.
You’ll notice some consistency 
in these stories so far — Dave 
always had to worry about me
Dave had just finished his bowl of 
Froot Loops, and instead of going 
through all the bother of making 
me a new bowl of my very own, 
dumped some cereal into his own 
milk. I was no idiot. I figured it 
out after about three bites. I don’t
Francine Gemperie/Special to 
not telling on him. You may be 
thinking that he deserved to be 
told on for those awful things 
that he did to me. However, being 
that I am the author of this piece,
I am able to point out the gross 
inequities of this relationship. So
far I have failed to mention that 
for a period in my youth, I would 
run crying to my mom alleging 
gross physical misconduct if my 
brothers so much as even touched 
me. I am not exaggerating, ei­
ther. Literally, all they had to do 
to get me screaming 
and crying, was to tap 
a fingertip on me. Some 
might call that being a 
crybaby, and they’d be 
right. I was the worst. 
Dave was so fascinated 
by my behavior, that 
he actually had one of 
his friends over just to 
show him how easy it 
was to make me cry. 
He touched my shoul­
der and I screamed for 
my mother.
If I left this as the 
final portrait of my 
brother Dave, you’d 
probably forgive me for 
forgetting his birth­
day, and maybe even 
understand why I am 
such a neurotic basket
________ case. But I need to tell
the Tartan you a little more about 
him. When I went into the hospi­
tal to dry out from many years of 
alcohol abuse, Dave was there 
with me. He and Rob helped me 
get through that, the toughest 
time in my life. Now that I am in 
school and constantly low on cash,
I notice that Dave is always there 
when I am really hurting for 
money. I never ask, he just gives 
it to me. “Here you go,” he says 
and hands me $40 — not just 
once, but many times. He is al­
ways consistent in showing his 
love for me and I can’t even re­
member to call him on his birth­
day. I can always remember to 
call him when I need something 
or just when I need to laugh, but 
that one day a year I always for­
get. It is incredibly selfish on my 
part. Yet, I know that as my 
brother, he will probably forgive 
me.
I know that there are others 
whom I have hurt. As I said, never 
intentionally, but I know it still 
hurts. What I need to do is grow 
up, start looking at what others 
need, and forget about my petty 
little neuroses. Until that day 
comes, I hope that the people I 
love continue to love and forgive 
me.
Andrew Sproule, Tartan busi­
ness manager, would like to say 
goodbye to the faithful readers of 
Neurotic Living. It’s starting to 
look like this may be his last col-r 
umn. He hopes that people have 
enjoyed sharing in his neuroses 
and hopes those involved with 
him, who are forced to deal with 
those same neuroses in person, 
will continue to put up with him.
Exercise, though horrible, relieves stress
Horror Stories
By Tom Harper
—There are few things that come close 
to the feeling just after a good workout, 
right? I’d name them, but that’s not 
what this column is about. Today’s lec­
ture (uhhh, I mean column,) is about 
exercise. Yep. Push it ’til it hurts. No 
pain, no brain.
Whenever I take a look around, it 
seems like there are a lot of people out 
there who look as though they’re allergic 
to exercise. You’ll spot them in the eleva­
tors going up only one floor. You’ll see 
them sitting for an eternity in front of a 
computer in the clusters. (NOTE: When 
you do work, it only seems like ar eter­
nity.) You’ll recognize them breathing 
heavily after climbing two flights of 
stairs.
Speaking of stairs, real men and 
women run up and down stairs. None of 
that cutesy-wutesy Step Reebok stuff. 
For example, check out the Donner fire 
stairs. Hardly anybody uses them. To 
improve my run time, my commander at 
my Reserve unit told me to run up and 
down the stairs three times. I looked up 
at five flights and said to myself, “Self, 
ain’t no way in hell I can run up and 
down five flights of stairs three times in 
a row.” But that’s where the motivation 
kicks in.
Lately I’ve been hearing a lot of bad 
press about ROTC and the military in
general. But let me say this — they will 
whip you into shape. If you’re in ROTC, 
you have no choice. When I went to Basic 
two summers ago, I was the 
sorriest guy there. But I did 
shape up. For example, when 
I first got there, I was only 
able to do a measely number 
of push-ups. I think the num­
ber was somewhere around 
eight. By graduation, I had 
gone from eight to 42. Go 
figure.
About a week ago, when it 
was time to run the stairs, 
after I got through staring at 
the flights in complete and 
utter disbelief, I just started 
running. Now, it’s a lot easier.
I hope I don’t wake anybody 
up, because I do this around 
1 am.
My other main source of 
exercise is personal training 
(PT) with Army ROTC. Here 
I have recounted a typical 
PT session from my point of 
view. Reading this may tire 
out some people, so proceed 
with caution.
Alarm goes off at 5:15 am.
I hit the snooze button. Alarm 
goes off again at 5:22.1 turn 
the alarm off. I wake up at 6 
wondering “Why the hell did 
I turn the damn alarm off?” 
and hurriedly throw on my 
uniform and head toward the 
fieldhouse.
Start stretching at 6:30 
sharp. This straightens out 
the kinks from me tossing and turning 
all night. My blankets are usually on the 
floor when I wake up.
Now it’s time for the good stuff. Push- fully, PT and the stairs will take care of 
ups, sit-ups, more push-ups, more sit- that. In Basic we worked up to 3.1 miles, 
ups, even more push-ups ... you get the and you don’t dare quit in the middle of
the run. To quote my drill 
sergeant, “The only excuse 
for falling out is if you’re 
dead.”
So I’m still working at it. 
I hope to have some more 
free time next semester so 
I can head to the weight 
room and maybe get in­
volved in some intramural 
sports. Let’s face it—when 
it comes to hobbies, for men 
and women, playing sports 
is the number one pastime. 
(Okay, it’s number two, but 
you can’t get number one 
24 hours a day on ESPN.)
I’ve also noticed I’m a lot 
bigger and meaner ever 
since I started. It does won­
ders for the mentality — 
or rather lack of it in my 
case.
So, why not get out and 
run a little? What’s the 
worst thing that can hap­
pen? Getting hit by one of 
those little red golf carts 
the physical plant work­
ers ride around in? (I’d like 
one of those. Those look 
cool!)

man, is currently making 
a video, “The Psychotic 
Workout.”For only $19.95 
you can see him run two
idea. And just when I think it can’t get miles with a spiked dog collar and chains 
any worse, it’s time for the run. on his neck. Mail th2n for further de-
I never was much of a runner. Hope- tails.

Fountainhead

FOUNTAINHEAD, from page LI
others. It is not a good trade.” said 
Bernstein. By giving up the things 
most precious to him, Keating has 
also lost his soul.
Villan Ellsworth Tooey’s “deep 
metaphysical terror of having to 
survive in the physical world 
hasoverwhelmed his personality 
since childhood.” Instead of confront­
ing his fears, he manipulates people’s 
wills and, quintessentially, takes 
away their soul.
The whole story demonstates that 
one’s soul or self is independently 
one’s reasoning mind. “To surrender 
autonomous thinking is to lose all... 
to lead to spiritual desolation” said 
Bernstein.
“Poverty is not constraining,” 
Bernstein replied to a woman who 
asked how some could live to their 
fullest potentials if they were “con­
strained” by poverty.
He supported this statement by 
saying that in a society that was 
truely free, poverty would not be 
constrained at all. Only in dictator­
ships where it was harder for people 
to become economically upwardly 
mobile that poverty would be debili­
tating. Since economic mobility is a 
feature of free societies, Berstein 
implied that the United States is a 
free society.
Echoing the immortal words of 
John F. Kennedy, Rand says, “It’s 
not what you can get out of society, 
it’s what you can give.” She once said 
that if she could have a epigram 
dedicated to her works, it would read 
“Dedicated to the Glory of Man.”

Laddergrams
by Mark Kantrowitz
In a laddergram, the object 
is to transform the word 
on the top rung into the 
word on the bottom rung 
in the least number of 
steps. During each step 
you must replace one 
letter in the previous word 
so that a new word is 
formed. but without 
changing the positions of 
the other letters. For 
example, we can change 
LEAD into GOLD in just 
three steps: LEAD, LOAD, 
GOAD, GOLD.

Dancers’ Symposium creates an impression
By KEEGAN FOLK
Tartan Forum Editor
Saturday night marked the fall performance of the 
Dancers’ Symposium. The performance was called “43 
minutes and 17 seconds with the Dancers’ Symposium,” 
and I must say I was glad it was so short. Not that all the 
performances were bad, some were excellent, but, as I 
have seen happen with other performances by this orga­
nization, some choreographers seem to get a little more 
attention than they may actually deserve.
All and all, though, I was impressed. The performance 
started out strong with a piece choreographed and per­
formed by Becky Mingo and Dutch MacDonald. Memo­
rable from last spring’s performance, once again Mingo 
and MacDonald treated the audience to a playful and 
skillful performance. I really don’t like to hear “playful” 
and “dance” in association, but Mingo and MacDonald are 
playful; they really seem to enjoy themselves, and their 
work consistently entertains.
Journey, danced by Sandra Culp and Sarah Kreidler, 
was next. This balletic piece was nice. The music was 
nice, the choreography was nice, you know what I mean.
I Nothing to write home about, but at the same time, it’s 
nice to see some people take an interest in more tradi­
tional and structured dance forms.
I don’t know what to say about the third piece of the
evening, BOING!, choreographed and performed by 
Shana Chun, Pamela Dobrowolski, and Sandhya Pal. 
My guess is that it was supposed to be funny. It was kind 
of funny, but too understated to invoke any real sense of 
humor. And when dancers look like they’d rather be 
writing a research paper than dancing, it makes me 
wonder.
Well, the action picked up quickly though, and so did 
the entertainment value, as the Carnegie Mellon Ball­
room Dance Club came on to treat us to their renditioit 
of the Texas Two-Step. Though they sometimes looked a 
little stiff, at least they looked like they were enjoying 
themselves.
Shaking the Tree was choreographed by Dina Ziskin,* 
with Richard Farina. This will sound like a strange 
thing to say about a dance piece, but it actually looked 
best when the dancers weren’t moving. Ziskin and Fa­
rina created some beautiful sculptures with the dancers’ 
still bodies, but the movement lacked spark.
Work, the last dance of the first half, was another piece 
choreographed by Mingo, this time with Jill Stutzman. 
Dancers Mingo, Culp, and Cena Myers, were great as a ; 
trio of harried working women. As they mechanically 
moved from here to there in their business attire, the 
ridiculousness of the monotonous, workaday world was 
brought out.

Juliet performed at Kresge
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Staffwriter
Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet has 
come to life once again in the Kresge 
Theatre. This play, older than the pro­
verbial hills, still has a majesty and 
tragedy that makes it a universal clas­
sic. The CMU Drama Department has 
managed to touch on much of that old 
power.
The performance doesn’t add anything 
novel to the play, but it still has its own 
charm. Superb acting by Juliet (Mary 
Bacon) and the Nurse (Robin Kurtz) 
added comedy to the tragedy which was 
also augmented by a mildly restrained 
Mercutio, played by Gabriel Macht.
There were some strained perfor­
mances by a melo­
dramatic Lady 
Capulet (Sophia 
Salguero), but bal­
ance was main­
tained by a superb 
ensemble and an 
assortment of 
witty servants.
The set was 
wonderfully real­
istic and the many 
changes it went 
through added 
depth to dialogue.
A strange mish­
mash of bells and 
rattles, whose 
triggers were 
sometimes un­
clear, were inter­
esting but not 
overly so.
Director Ste­
phen Keep Mills’ 
vision was por­
trayed with clar­
ity and under­
standing. The 
many little 
touches, such as 
Juliet’s death be­
ing carried out like 
some macabre
wedding night, made the play enjoyable 
and well worth the viewing.
I only found one major problem in this 
production of Romeo and Juliet: I knew 
how it was going to end. But, so did anyone 
who has been to high school. Otherwise, 
this wonderful work was played with re­
spect for the language and an energy and 
understanding that a good Shakespearean 
production needs. The Drama Department 
did a fascinating rendition of this classic 
play. Bill, needless to say, would have been 
pleased.
Romeo and Juliet runs until December 
11. Times for weekend shows are 2 pm and 
8 pm.
Tickets are five dollars with a student 
I.D. This week, November 22 arid 23, it is 
presented at 8 pm.

John Woo action films excite
By DAVID BAZELON
Tartan Staffwriter
Are you ready for an expedience? Are 
you ready for your eyeballs to^spin? Are 
you ready for adrenalin to soar through 
your system at 90 miles pefc hour and 
leave you with your jaw dropped down to 
the floor? Well, two of Hong Kong action 
director John Woo’s films ¿the Killer and 
Hardboiled will give you s^clf an experi­
ence
You may have seen Woo’s naime in his 
first American effort, Hard Target, star­
ring Jean Claude Van Damme, or you 
may have already known of the director’s 
cult status in Hong Kong. For anyone 
who does not know of him, it is well worth 
the price of admission to see his earlier 
works. Before Hard Target, Woo was 
making films in Hong Kong and working 
with actors such as Chow Yun Fat, Woo’s 
favorite. Both The Killer and Hardboiled 
star Chow. While The Killer portrays 
Chow as an assassin and Hardboiled 
portrays him as a cop, he is always the 
good guy and, in order to keep things 
interesting, he never takes prisoners. 
There have even been rumors that Chow 
is supposed to be starring in Woo’s next 
American release. Hopefully these ru­
mors have substance.
So what makes this man’s films so 
enthralling? Why does Chow kick butt, 
so to speak? It is all in the unrepentant 
movement of action. Woo’s films come 
fast and hard.
They have incredible action sequences 
that come one after another, with little 
space for any overly dramatized plot de­
velopment. If a character realizes some­
thing about himself or about his enemy, 
it will happen in the midst of a spray of 
bullets, a burning building, or just at the 
conclusion of an onslaught,-of general 
violence. Furthermore, Woo‘s films show 
that he has an incredible imagination. 
He never has a character leave a movie 
without having gone through a whole 
myriad of turmoils. Each sequence builds 
its tension as the hero does some of the 
most impossible acts and only succeeds 
by the skin of his teeth. Hardboiled, for 
example, has Chow leap from a burning 
hospital with the aid of a water hose
while cautiously cradling a baby in his 
arms. The Killer has Chow step on the 
edge of a table along which his gun sits. 
His gun hurdles through the air and 
comes to rest in his hand all so that he 
can defend himself in time from an ap­
proaching bad guy. The Killer also has a 
blind lover’s crawl which has to be seen 
to be believed.
Woo also has an amazing aptitude for 
camera placement. In The Killer, there is 
a camera view positioned right next to a 
speeding car’s door that throws the 
viewer’s perspective into a totally unex­
pected place. Woo’s camera careens 
through each sequence with a great 
amount of sureness. He knows what he 
wants to show the audience and it is not 
going to get soft. When the action stops, 
the camera is still. When a gunshot’s 
sound blares through the theater, the 
camera goes flying.
Woo does not only show himself as a 
director. In many sequences, he almost 
comes across as a choreographer. He 
works with numerous amounts of actors 
all in the same scene and keeps them all 
active and focused on their roles in that 
particular scene.
Each person is joining in a marvelous 
group movement against the hero, of 
which their are rarely more then two. In 
Hardboiled Chow comes swinging from 
a wire down into a warehouse with his 
machine gun blazing into a crowd of 
illegal weapons dealers.
Out of nowhere, another man comes 
screeching in on his motorcycle, skids on 
the ground, and jumps up ready to fight. 
All the while the crowd gets fully into the 
action with half of them trying to close up 
the gun stockpiles, and half of them try­
ing to grab the same weapons in order to 
return Chow’s gunfire. Chow must have 
spent half a minute in the air just emp­
tying his clip into the crowd while the 
criminals stood on the pavement, on car 
hoods, or ran for their guns, but all in 
retaliation.
If you need a good film to relax by, do 
not see these either of these two films. If 
you need a real hard, fast moving, fun 
time, then The Killer and Hardboiled are 
two of your best bets. Simply put, I can­
not think of a better stress reliever.
Aimee Mann performs
By SUSAN STUART
Tartan Staffwriter
If there is an artist who has 
proven that success and popu­
larity don’t always go together, 
it’s Aimee Mann. Mann, for­
merly of ’Til Tuesday, played 
at Rosebud Saturday night 
with a guest appearance by 
Dave Gregory of XTC on key­
boards and guitar.
If anyone remembers Mann 
and the group ‘Til Tuesday, 
they would classify them as a 
one-hit-wonder from the mid- 
’80s. The sexy video “Voices 
Carry” featured the bleach- 
blonde hair style that began 
the trend of “tails.” You may 
have a dusty old cassette of 
’Til Tuesday’s first album 
stuffed in a box somewhere 
amidst tapes of Michael Jack­
son and Duran Duran. But if 
you haven’t listened to Aimee 
Mann since the days of break- 
dancing, you’ve been missing 
out. Each release ’Til Tuesday 
has had since then has been 
better than the one before. 
Aimee Mann, now performing 
solo, is an extraordinary tal­
ent who delivers a dynamic 
sound.
Vocally, Mann is right up 
there with Natalie Merchant, 
Tori Amos, Sinead O’Connor, 
or any other of the top female 
talents of today. As long as 
you like, don’t mind, or can get 
past the subject matter of most 
of her songs being love-gone- 
wrong, then you’ll find that 
she’s talented in musical com­
position as well.
The quality of her perfor­
mance Saturday was no dif­
ferent from any other I’ve seen. 
She was remarkable. As al­
ways, she played with passion 
and sang with a voice that 
could melt steel. The biggest 
difference in her sound was a 
greater variety of accompani­
ments—from electric to acous­
tic guitar to acoustic piano. As 
usual, her warm and witty per­
sonality added to the enter­
tainment. The performance 
was rounded out by the pleas­
ant surprise of XTC’s Dave 
Gregory on keyboards and gui­
tar. I found Gregory to be a 
well-suited complement to 
Mann, both because of his tal­
ent and because of his similar 
anti-fame, antiestablishmeijt 
position in the music business.
The red tape of the industry 
has managed to keep Aimee 
Mann behind the backdrop of 
the music world — but not for 
long. She recently signed un­
der the Imago label and is be­
ing promoted to the hilt. I guar­
antee you’ll be hearing more 
from this musical dynamo.
New Addams Family movie doesn’t live up to its predecessor
Addams Family Values 
'kir'k
Starring Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd, 
and Joan Cusack. New film continuing the adventures 
of the Addams Family, who now have a new baby. Now 
Playing at Squirrell Hill Cinema World.
CHRISTIAN M. RESTIFO
Special to The Tartan
In a display of traditional values that would 
make Dan Quayle smile and Murphy Brown cry, 
Gomez, Morticia, and the whole gang return to the 
screen in Addams Family Values, the sequel to the 
Popular 1991 film. This time, however, they’re 
Joined by a new family member. Sporting slicked 
btack hair, a moustache, and a pale face like his 
father, Pubert (played by twin girls Kaitlyn and 
Kristin Hooper) acts just like any newborn baby, 
^ell, an Addams newborn, that is.
This new bundle of joy doesn’t come without 
problems, however. Wednesday (Christina Ricci) 
and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) feel left out and 
begin to show signs of sibling rivalry. Wednesday 
convinces Pugsley that there is a tradition in 
which an older child must die when a new baby is 
born. And, of course, they only need one boy.
To deal with this new problem, Gomez (Raul 
Julia) and Morticia (Angelica Houston) decide to 
hire a nanny. After several nannies quit, the 
Addams find salvation in Debbie (Joan Cusack), a 
nanny who recently returned from abroad.
Unlike normal people, Debbie takes to the 
Addams’ immediately. She is a serial murderer 
who marries rich men, kills them on their honey­
moon night, and runs with the money. Down to a 
few dollars and change, she takes the job to get 
closer to Fester (Christopher Lloyd) and ultimately 
the Addams family fortune.
To get Wednesday and Pugsley out of the way, 
Debbie convinces Gomez and Moriticia that the 
two children have a bizarre request:— they want 
to go to summer camp. The parents begrudgingly 
agree, and the two Addams children get an expo­
sure to upper-class white society.
With them away, Debbie begins her scheme to
win Fester’s heart and marry him. Once married, 
though, she leams that it takes quite a bit to kill 
him. After turning him into a sex slave, Debbie 
demands that he never see his family, again.
The story Unfolds as the Addams’ try to save 
Uncle Fester. Unless you have some obsession to 
learn the ending, however, I suggest you wait until 
the movie comes to DH 2210.
The cast and crew again did an amazing job at 
recreating that Addams aura, but its novelty has 
worn off since the first movie. Only a few ofPubert’s 
actions are fuimy. Most attempts at humor are 
banal. Debbife’s control of Fester and the pain it 
causes Gomez and his family seems too similar to 
problems caiised by Fester’s adopted mother in the 
first movie. However, there are a few humorous 
parts, including one where Debbie digs up Fester’s 
mother to get an engagement ring.
Better parts of tile movie come from Wednesday 
and Pugaiey’s experience at Camp Chippewa. 
Forced to ttodfergo the constant “feel good” antics of 
Gary and ^ecky Granger (Peter MacNicol and 
Christine Bar&nski), they are punished by having 
to sit in the drfea&ed Harmony Cabin for not being 
perky and loving towards others. Joined by the 
nerdy Joel Glicker (David Krumholtz), they are
forced to watch The Sound of Music, The Little 
Mermaid, and other unspeakable horrors.
Wednesday’s antagonist, the typical blond prin­
cess with rich parents, wins the key role in the 
camp’s play about Thanksgiving, while Wednes­
day gets to play Pocahantas. Her speech about the 
disparity between Native Americans and the white 
society is hilarious. She and her collection of non­
white, geeky, and rejected “Indians” wreak havoc 
on the play in a gut-busting “attack.”
Without Camp Chippewa, though, the movie 
acts like any other sequel. The ending is a tad 
cheezy (for lack of a better word). If you’re an 
Addams freak, you’ll probably chuckle sporadi­
cally throughout the movie. If not, you may con­
sider waiting to see this one on campus or in the 
video store. The wait will be worth the four-dollar 
savings.
r guide to the stars
?????Pretty damn cool.
????Sorta cool.
???Maybe worth a matinee.
Wait till it comes to DH.
?Just plain bad.

Dance show enjoyable
hVtgIj from page L9
A short intermission followed 
that piece. Let’s take a moment 
0f intermission from dance re­
view ourselves. I’d like to talk 
about the idea of the women’s 
gym as a venue for dance. It’s 
horrible. I’m not blaming the 
Symposium—I’m sure they are 
happy to have the space to per­
form at all — but it really is a 
shame they have to do it in the 
women’s gym. I was sitting in 
the second row and I couldn’t 
see anything. If you sit in the 
front row, it’s kind of like watch­
ing a tennis match.
You are so close to the per­
formers that as they move back 
and forth, so does your head. 
Just hope that things aren’t 
going on at opposite sides of the 
stage. The best view is from 
standing in the back — if you 
stand on a ladder so you can see 
the dancers’ feet. Anyway, back 
to the performance.
'When Peter Returned Home 
from the War, choreographed 
by Peter Boucher, MacDonald, 
Mingo, and Stutzman, was per­
formed by Boucher, MacDonald, 
Mingo and Myers.
I was thinking it would prob­
ably be some slow and solemn 
dance, but once again the play­
fulness of Mingo and Mac­
Donald shone through.
Mingo’s Head,Shoulders,
Knees, and Toes, was probably 
my favorite piece of the night. 
Mingo coordinated eight danc­
ers into fun but sophisticated 
movement around the stage. 
Mingo’s choreography was some 
of the best in last spring’s per­
formance, and she triumphed 
once again this semester.
Going to Town, choreo­
graphed by Kayt Sukel, was in 
the same spirit as Mingo’s 
Head, Shoulders, Knees, and 
Toes. Many of the same dancers 
were used. The more energetic 
and fun pieces, such as this one, 
were the most successful of the 
evening.
The dancers looked like they 
were having fun, even if they 
didn’t always look like they 
knew what they were doing. I 
understand that not all dance 
needs to be exciting and playful 
to be good, but when this style 
of dance is placed in context 
withmore “serious” dance, play­
ful tends to win out.
The Dancer’s Symposium, as 
far as I know, is not composed of 
professional dancers. It is made 
up, as I understand it, of people 
who love to dance and to cho­
reograph. And Saturday night, 
the best pieces were the fun 
pieces. So maybe it isn’t the 
Joffrey, but it’s good to see 
people excercising their talents, 
regardless.

Fritz the Cat
This X-rated animation film is lifted right from 
Robert Crumb’s underground comic strip of Nm­beonml Lmmpoon fame. Lots of obscenity, anarchy, 
and cartoon animal love making. This film will be 
followed by a Felix the Cat short, “Tee Time.”
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Fredmy, Deiember 3
Rising Sun
With the help of a former police detective and 
Japanese culture expert, played by Sean Connery, 
Wesley Snipes finds himself chasing the Yakuza 
(Japanese Mafia) while trying to solve the murder 
of a woman at a big Japanese business party, which 
leads Connery and Snipes to believe that the 
“Godfather’s” son is responsible. Tia Carrera stars 
as Connery’s lover and video expert who plays with 
a tape taken by a surveilance camera that happens 
to record the murder in hopes of identifying the 
killer’s face hidden in the dark.
The melodrama is a bit overdone, but with three 
big names like Connery, Snipes, and Carrera, who’s 
to complain for a buck?
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Hard Target
Jean Claude Van Damme stars in this explosive 
action film. rmrd ,mrgeb, the American directorial 
debut of Hong Kong legend, JohnWoo, was anx­
iously awaited by many of Woo’s American fans. 
Unfortunately, it’s not ,he Keller. rmrd ,mrgeb 
bows to the standards of Hollywood. So if you’re 
looking for a good film by this great director, keep 
looking. Van Damme fights against men who hunt 
down homeless veterans on the streets of New 
Orleans in this retelling of ,he Mosb Dmngerots Gmme. Add in the requisite love interest and special 
effects, and you’ve got another overblown Van 
Damme action film in yet another setting. Saved 
from complete real movie obsolescence by Woo’s 
artistic influence over some of the cinematography.
At 6, 8, 10 pm, and midnight.

Five Golden Dragons
This 1967 British film is about a naive American 
involved in an international crime ring in Hong 
Kong. It stars Robert Cummings and includes cam­
eos by Margaret Lee and Maria Perschy.
It’s not surprising this was Cumming’s last fea­
ture film considering its mindless plot. However, 
with finals coming up, your mind will probably be 
like mush anyway.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Marvel brings greetings for Holiday season
This is my 11th and final in­
stallment of Comic Book 
Chronicles for the semester.You 
could call it the 11th Hour. It 
brings a sudden tear to my eye. 
However, I’m going to end on a 
happy note. With the holidays 
looming near, I thought that this 
would be the perfect time to re­
view the Marvel Holiday Special 
which just came out last week. 
With finals week looming near, I 
am definitely in need of 64 pages 
of holiday cheer for the meager 
price of $2.95.
This book isn’t much different 
than prevoius holiday specials 
from Marvel or DC, but it’s still 
something I look forward to each 
year. What amazes me is that 
these stories don’t dwell too much 
on Christmas or Chanukah, but 
focus on the emotional aspects of 
these winter holidays. Once each 
year, these characters get a break 
from saving the world and are 
portrayed in a more human man­
ner.
The first story is a Spider-Man 
tale, “Hopes and Fears.” This is a 
more serious story than usual in 
which Spidey battles the demon 
Mephisto for the Spirit of Christ­
mas. I enjoyedhowthis story was 
presented, especially the Faust 
allusion and the similarities to 
one of my holiday favorites—Dr. 
Seuss’s How the Grinch Stole 
Christmas. Although “Hopes and
Comic Book Chronicles
By Jason Andracki
Fears” was somewhat of a super­
natural story, it still captured 
the spirit of the season and was 
my favorite story of the issue. 
“Down Time” was the next story 
featuring Nick Fury of
S.H.I.E.L.D. I was never a fan of 
Fury, so that explains why I didn’t 
understand the story. It was writ­
ten and illustrated by Howard 
Chaykin. Chaykin assumes ev­
eryone knows the characters 
(which I don’t), so he doesn’t 
bother to explain who Pam 
Hawley is even though the story 
revolves around her. This was 
easily my least favorite part of 
the book.
Following this was an ex­
tremely light-hearted adaptation 
of 0. Henry’s “Gift of the Magi,” 
“The Gift of the Marvelites.” In­
stead of having a husband and 
wife, this version had Tom 
DeFalco, Marvel’s editor-in-chief, 
and Mark Gruenwald, editor, 
writer, and all around nice guy. 
Although it was silly, I still liked 
it because of its take off on “The 
Gift of the Magi.”
Marvel’s biggest joke of a hero, 
Captain Ultra, starred in the next
sillystory,“MudPi.” Fortunately, 
the Captain was covered in mud 
for more than half of the story, so
I didn’t have to put up with his 
hideous green, blue, orange, red, 
andyellowcostume. Actually, this 
wasn’t too bad of a tale, but I 
really don’t know why it was part 
of this holiday issue. Since it was 
a joke, I assumed that “Mud Pi” 
would have something to do with 
3.14159, but it didn’t. What a let 
down.
“HarveyTeabiscuit’s Yule Log” 
is a Ghost Rider story that is a 
little more serious than the pre­
vious two. Ghost Eider comes to 
the aid of Harvey, who is bul­
