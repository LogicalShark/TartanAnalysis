VOL. XIII. NO. 7.CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIAMAR. 12, 1919
SOPHOMORE BANQUET REMARKABLE SUCCESSTWO LIVE MEETINGS, ONE BOOSTER AND ONE PEP
The big event of tne year for the 
Science Sophomore Class came off 
with a “bang” at S: 30 last Wednes­
day evening at the Lincoln Club. 
The banquet was a complete success 
.from the cabaret and exhibition 
¦dances to the decorative Plebe “wall 
¿lowers.” Eats! they couldn’t have 
been better. The menu read some­
thing as follows:
Tomato Juice 
Sticks Green Eggs Rosebuds 
Aquarium Fruit, Dressed 
Shavings
• Buzzard With Mud 
Sea Foam and Pebbles on the Side 
Mrs. Wiggs in the Cabbage Patch 
Cold Cream 
Dog Biscuit 
Army Fluid
Dean Mott, Professors Kellar and 
Trinks, Dean Tarbell and Hans Wag­
ner were guests and each gave a 
short talk. Every one was a “cork­
er.” And, oh, how Hans loves left 
ihanded pitchers.
During the course of the evening 
¦a, bunch of Freshmen took it upon 
. themselves to break up' the banquet. 
-As one of the Sophomores was out­
side the banquet hall a number of 
Plebes abducted him. But not with-1 
out resistance. Nothing seemel to: 
“be too much for them at that moment j 
so they picked up the automobile , of I 
one of the banqueters.. (not a flivver, I 
by the way). They proceeded toI 
take the Sophomore to East " Liberty j 
.•and from there to the East Dormi-) 
tory. There they again decided in¦ 
iavor of a ride and about IS piled j 
on the automobile and went down i 
into Pittsburgh. In front of the Nix-: 
•on theater a pep meeting was held, i 
Cheers were given for Tech and the; 
captive Sophomore. After a short | 
speller the party returned to the 
•dormitory. Here the automobile was 
given to Mr. Bromer who drove it to 
the Lincoln Club and again joined the 
-happy party.
Less than half a minute after the
• kidnaping took place the dining room 
was empty save for the faculty 
guests. . In about five minutes the 
class reassembled with their booty, 
some IS Plebes. These became part 
of the color scheme L'br some time. 
.After everything had quieted down 
•another group of Sophomores re­
turned with a real prize. They had 
captured .the acting president of the 
Plebe class.
It is said cabaret dancers' em- 
Jjarrass certain members of the Plebe 
class. You should have seen just 
one of them. Afterwards he said of­
ficially that he sometimes got 
'“fussed.” In our opinion, for several 
minutes he looked just about like 
two cents at the Waldorf. But the 
-acting president of the Plebes! 
Nothing like embarrassment for him. 
He even volunteered, to dance with 
the dancer. He started, but not for 
long, as the Sophomores would never 
;stand for anything like that.
Great credit for the success of the1 
"banquet is due President Schmidt 
and to the committee in charge 
"which consisted of H. E. Bromer,1 
•chairman; I-I. C. Henderson. F. I.; 
Smith, Arthur F. Leet and Frank; 
Smith.
Between booster posters, booster as­
semblies, booster basket ball, booster 
poetry, and booster “Y” meetings, 
M. M. C. C. is having a gay time these 
days. It is difficult to say which is 
best, but the Y. W. meeting surely 
comes in for a good share of the 
praise.
Bernice Kruger was the leader of 
the meeting. To assist her was M. M. 
C. C.’s Hawaiian Orchestra, composed 
of M. Kiefer. R. McCloskey, G. Sheriff. 
N. Bigley, F. Lutz, M Halderman and 
M. McCaughey. They played several 
pretty selections, butvlike all true ar­
tists, could not be induced to give an 
encore. Mary Bechtel spoke on 
¿Boosting Athletics.” Her talk was 
interesting, and to the point. Eleanor 
Cox spoke on “Fellowship,” especially 
that as promoted by the Central Y. W. ¦ 
C. A.’s .Pleasant Hill Camp. This in­
spired Miss Holmes to give a few 
reminiscences on “Eaglesmere.’’
The meeting was closed with a 
short talk on “The Attitude of the Up­
perclassmen Toward Freshmen,’’ by 
Josephine Whitney. There have been 
quite a few talks .of this nature by the 
Freshmen the past few weeks, and 
their suggestions, although not always 
feasible, at least show an interest in 
the school which is gratifying to the 
Upperclassmen.
Y. W. meeting tomorrow, conducted 
by the Faculty. All out, students! 
Let's show our Faculty that we know 
they have “a young spirit” and that we 
are trying to “cultivate, their ac­
quaintance/’ as the posters say.
The “pep” meeting held at the 
Science Assembly last Wednesday 
evening, showed that all the spirit 
isn’t dead yet. After several songs 
and cheers, Dean Tarbell addressed 
the gathering and told of the function 
of the new office, “Dean of Men.”
Dr. Marks, with his usual vigor, 
made a plea for participation in ath­
letics. Hans Wagner talked about the 
possibilities of the baseball team. 
Bert Bianchi, our new - basket ball 
coach, talked over the basket ball sit­
uation.
The keynote of the meeting was “give 
your support' to the" team oh Friday 
night.” Stark led the cheers.
Ellerton and Sweeney played on the 
guitar and banjo, respectively. A 
group of four from the Glee Club or­
ganized a quartet and made a very 
good combination.
MUSICAL CLUBS'FIRST ¡M. M. C. S. SENIORS GIVE NOTABLES TO ATTEND TOUR A SUCCESS! STUNT PERFORMANCES DESIGN COSTUME BALL
Musical Clubs on Tuesday night 
made their debut, for the season of 
1919 at the sixth annual concert at 
May view. Pa. The clubs left Union 
Station at 5:26 and arrived in time 
for a big dinner. Sixty men made the 
trip. The dinner was served by at­
tractive nurses who were told that a 
girls’ club was coming. The nurses 
were much surprised to find them in 
male attire.
From the quantity of the dinner, 
about 150 girls were expected, no 
doubt. But, Oh Boy! Hoover certainly 
would approve of the clubs’ economy.
The clubs wrere very well pleased 
with the concert. The Glee Club sang 
true,, although they were not too 
familiar with their words. The Man­
dolin Club played “Till We Meet 
Again” with such expression that sev­
eral benevolent old ladies in the front 
row burst out in tears. The sorrow 
turned to screams of laughter at the 
witty readings of Messrs. Knorr and 
j Agnew Infield.
The concert was hurried through 
and afterwards the boys cleared away 
the seats and danced with the nurses 
until time for the train.
The clubs had special cars both go­
ing and returning and most all the 
countryside down that way knows 
that “something noisy from Carnegie
SENIOR CLASS OF SCIENCE SCHOOL MEETS
What would you do if you were in­
vited to come to “the most stupen­
dous extravaganza of the year” and 
“gaze upon the optical feast?” Why 
you'd go, of course. And that’s just 
What the M. M.’s did.
The Senior Stunt Committee enter­
tained in the Recreation Hall Wed­
nesday noon and their performance 
was all that was promised, and more. 
The Regimental Band, led by Bernice 
Kruger, scored the first hit. It 
breathed out its harmonies during the 
exquisite displays of Evening Dresses, 
Afternoon Dresses, Boudoirs, Kids, 
and Bathing Costumes. The take-offs 
on' each of these dainty exhibitions 
drew much applause and laughter.
The Stunt Committee—-Elinor Mel­
lon, Mary Ege and Peg Hollar deserve 
much credit for this marvelous pro­
duction. So successful was it that a I 
second performance was given Thurs­
day noon by special request.
The Stunt Committees of the other 
classes will have to.hustle to put on 
anything to compete with the Seniors’ 
lavish display. The Juniors show their 
skill on Wednesday of this week.
The keenest interest is being .man­
ifested in the “Fete. Fantastic' 
which will be held, in the Design 
School on March 27. The chairman 
of the committee again wishes to re­
quest all applications for tickets to 
be sent in as soon as possible.

STEEL RESEARCH LABORATORYAT CARNEGIE TECH PLANNED
Inventive Ingenuity oF All 
District Manufacturers to 
Be United in Work Which 
Will Be Financed by Indus­
try—Shinkle Named Head
The inventive ingnuity of practi­
cally all the steel companies in this 
¦vicinity will be united in the estab­
lishment of a rolling mill research 
laboratory at the Carnegie Institute 
•of Technology with the definite view 
¦of making Pittsburgh not only the 
-world's leading steel center, from a 
standpoint of production, but the 
iplace from which all future ideas in 
the making and rolling of steel will 
•emanate. The new research bureau 
¦will be conducted under the auspices 
•of the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology, but financed and controlled 
entirely by the steel industry. Wil­
liam B. Shinkle, reputed to be one 
of the country’s foremost rolling mill 
authorities, will be ~ its directing 
head. It will be the only institution 
of its sort in the world.
Work of organizing the big labor­
atory afnd its staff will begin Monday 
morning when Mr. Skinkle will re­
sign from the Carnegie Steel Com­
pany and begin to draw his plans. 
Establishment of the entire bureau 
-will require perhaps six months and 
an expenditure of approximately 
§150,000. The laboratory will be iso-

JUNIOR CIVILS PRACTICE FOR THISTLE-SEA EASE
Junior Civils, put *er there. You 
tossed in a pebble that made more 
than a ripple when you started your 
new paper.
The Sea Ease is not the product of 
some other class, but the outcome of 
the pep of the 1920 C.' E.’s.
This should be a hint to some oth­
ers to show a little life. We have not 
heard the jazz of a grinding cog since 
the-last one in last year’s Thistle.
For the accommodation of those 
subscribers who have not yet received 
their copy of “The 1918 Thistle” the 
sales manager, F. .1. Nuttall, will be 
in the Students Activities Office, on 
the. thircl floor of the Central Building 
on Thursday afternoon of tills week, 
March 13, from 11:30 a. m., to 5:00 
p. m. Subscribers are requested to 
bring their receipts.
METS. & MECHS. INSPECT NATIONAL TUBE MILL
On Thursday, March 6, 1919, the 
Junior and Senior Metallurgists and 
the Senior Mechanicals faking the 
Steel Works Option, make an in- 
spection trip under the direction of 
Prof. Crabtree to the National Tube 
Company’s plant at McKeesport. The 
plant is ideal for an inspecting party 
to observe for several reasons. First, 
because at this plant the .students 
had the opportunity to follow the 
different stages in the process of 
making steel tubes from the smelting 
of the ore to the testing of the 
finished pipe. Other retasons for be­
ing a good mill to observe, are the 
facts that the plant is very well ar­
ranged, all safety devices possible 
are used on the machines, and the 
scale of production carried out at 
this place is gigantic.
SOPHOMORE CLASS HELD BUSINESS MEETING
The Sophomore Class held a busi­
ness meeting on March 3. All of those 
important matters pertaining to the 
banquet were discussed. Announce­
ment was made by the committee in 
charge that the Soph Hop would take 
place some time early in April.
Charles Todd resigned as Thistle 
representative of the class. Albert 
C. May was elected to succeed him.
Much joy was expressed when the 
Freshman conduct committee report­
ed that Freshman hats would SQon be 
on sale.
PATRONIZE OUR ADVERTISERS.
TEA GIVEN IN HONOR OF MRS. SALISBURY
On Thursday-afternoon, from three- 
thirty to four-thirty, in the Faculty 
Parlors, Miss Sturtevant and the Sen­
ior girls of the Secretarial Depart­
ment gave a tea to all the girls in 
that Department, in honor of Mrs. 
Salisbury, who has been . instructor 
at M. M. C. S. ever since the war, 
and the departing war-course girls. 
Although all were saddened at the 
thought of losing Mrs. Salisbury and 
these more than thirty girls, all pres­
ent, including many regular College 
students, and Dean Breed, had such 
an enjoyable time, that in spite of 
Miss Sturtevant’s invitation having 
read from three-thirty to four-thirty, 
at five o’clock the faculty parlors 
were still pretty full. Chocolate 
cakes that were served with the tea, 
doubtless proved an added attraction 
to' the tea and company. Miss Sturte­
vant has given many teas at Mar­
garet Morrison, and has always 
proved a charming hostess.
TECH MAN RESCUES M.M. MAIDEN, RISKING LIFE
Were is not for the gallantry and 
courage of one of our Tech men M. M. 
C. S. would today be mourning the 
loss1 of one of its Plebes. Think of it, 
men; lie happened along just at the 
psychological moment! Did you ever 
hear of such luck? Just as the poor 
little Freshman was sinking to her. 
doom in the mud in front of the Ilut,
anr vainly crying for help ------ (by
request) came striding along, saw the 
damsel's plight, rushed to her,' nobly 
flung her muff to safety, and--carried 
her to shore. • Did he care that his 
shoes became muddy? Not he! Did 
he become embarrassed as his audi­
ence grew? Giless not! Who ever 
heard of a Tech man becoming 
fussed! (?)
Fellows, to become a hero in the 
eyes of all M. M. C. S., all you have to 
do the next muddy day is to await 
your opportunity along the Cut. Res­
ervations will be made In advance.
M. M. C. S. SECRETARIAL INSTRUCTOR LEAVING
SECOND MEETING OF 
FOUR SCHOOLS COUNCIL
Mrs. Salisbury, who has been in­
structor in the Margaret Morrison 
Secretarial Department since the fall 
of 1917. is leaving this week, to rejoin 
her husband, Captain Donald W. Salis­
bury. in New York City. Mrs. Salis­
bury is a graduate of Symonds Col­
lege, 1917. She had been married but 
a few days, when her husband was 
called to France with the Y. M. C. A. 
Since then, he has become a captain 
in the Regular Army. When Captain 
Salisbury went to France, Mrs. Salis­
bury became a faculty member of the 
Secretarial Department at M. M. C. C. 
She has been instructing steadily, in­
cluding over the summer, with the ex­
ception of an eight weeks’ leave of 
absence which was granted to her this 
fall, to join Captain Salisbury, who 
was then in Washington, D. C., on fur­
lough. Captain Salisbury is at pres­
ent in New York, and is still in the 
Government service.
The Secretarial Department, is truly 
sorry to lose Mrs. Salisbury..
COMMERCIALS SWAMP CHEMICALS, 25-5
The fast and speedy Junior Coun­
cil basket ball team met and de­
feated the Junior Chemical Tlorn- 
blowers. The game was played Wed­
nesday afternoon at the Tech gym. 
Fawcett, Giffen, Elliott, Cohen and 
Welshasky starred for the Commer­
cials. The score was 25 to 5.
Red Nemser,was very much in evi­
dence on the opposing side judging 
from the way the referee blew his 
whistle.
The second meeting of the Council 
was held in the Central Building on 
Wednesday, March 5, 1919. Reports 
were given by the vurious commit­
tees appointed by the president at 
the first meeting. Reports were as 
follows: I
Alma Mater: An editorial was put
Info The Tartan to work up the spir­
it of the thing. The attention of the 
Department of Music, Design School 
was called to the matter. As yet 
nothing has come in in the way of 
a new Alma Mater.
Student Assemblies—Collection of
10 cents from each student.
Industries School Is the first school 
to have Its required amount. No re­
port from the other schools, except 
that M. M. C. ('«. will have her allot­
ted amount by March 20, 1919.
Senior Tables—Things worked out 
pretty smoothly.
Senior Ring Committee'—Given un­
til next council meeting, March 20.
Plebe Regulations—Plans now be­
ing formulated to bo divulged at a 
later date. Plebe hats the only set­
tled question sp far.
In the way of new business, a 
committee was appointed by the 
president, to • see the administrative 
board to have a “clean up day” on 
the campus sometime in the spring. 
This cannot be emphasized too 
strongly because the campus is in an 
awful condition. (Look about you 
and see if. you don’t think it is a 
good idea. Especially the hollow 
beside M. M. C. C.) Committee— 
Chairman, Ira Stark; Nuttall, Avery, 
Truman.
• A committee was. also appointed 
to have more General Assemblies at 
Carnegie Hall. The idea is to work 
up more Tech and have an All-Stu­
dent program without faculty. Com­
mittee—Batman, chairman; Kruger, 
Miller.
Another committee was appointed, 
to look into the matter of getting t 
programs for commencement. Com­
mittee—Miller, chairman; Kruger, 
Batman, Waterson.
AVO CLUB DINNER AND THEATRE PARTY
The Avo Club of the School of
Applied Industries held a dinner par­
ty at the Seventh Avenue Hotel fol­
lowed by a theater party at the 
Davis, March 6.
The affair was 100 per cent Tech.
All honorary and active members be­
ing there. After doing justice to
the spread placed in front of them 
Toastmaster G. T. Haddaeus called 
upon Prof. IT, A. Calderwood who 
responded by stating his experiences 
upon his trip to the western cities 
for the purpose of attending a con­
vention of vocational teachers. He 
related different; points whereby In­
dustrial training was the training of 
today and the future.
Mr. Prevls the next speaker, re­
lated his past eight and, one-half years’ 
experience in the army. Six and a

PITT TOSSERS BEAT TECH IN CLOSE GAME
Tech’s crippled basket ball team 
lost to Pitt last Friday night. before 
the largest crowd that ever packed 
the gym, the final shore being 34 to
26. The game was a battle from 
the first whistle to the end of the 
last period, both teams working like 
machines. Time and time again 
Tech worked the ball under their 
basket only to have It roll around 
the iron ring and then jump out, 
they had no luck with them. The 
Pitt team seemed to have an un­
canny accuracy for finding the basket 
and quite a number of their shots 
were spectacular.
The game started with a rush, 
neither team scoring for a few min­
utes. The score see-sawed until the 
last five minutes of the first half 
when Pitt forged seven points ahead, 
the half ending 19 to 12.
The second half was a thriller. 
Tech guarded closely and held the Pitt 
score down, at the same time 
piling up more than they did in the 
first half. But the final score ended 
in favor of Pitt and considering the 
crippled condition of our team we 
can still hold our heads high with 
pride.
Had Captain Gretzler been able to 
play there Is no doubt that the 
score would bo entirely reversel. 
Foxon played a fine game in spite of 
the condition of his knee which has 
troubled him all year. Lynn and 
I-Iaminan played a great game for
Tech, while Levine was the best bet
for Pitt. The summary.

COSMOPOLITAN CLUB HOLDS FIRST MEETING
Mr. Carnegie’s philanthropic nature 
has expressed itself in many ways, but 
none could be nobler that the one 
which entitles him to the place of the 
champion of International understand­
ing. Of all those who belong to Tech, 
no one will be more interested than 
Mr, Carnegie to read of the formation 
of a club at Tech which, in a small 
measure, will put into effect the prin­
ciples the realization of which formed 
a great part of his aspirations, and 
for which he spent a great part of his 
fortune.
The governing principle of the Cos­
mopolitan Club is to foster the spirit 
of universal brotherhood. By the so­
cial and intellectual intercourse . 
among its members, from different 
parts of the earth, the club will un-. 
doubtedly stimulate the study and 
mutual appreciation of the current 
problems, and events, and opportuni­
ties in foreign countries. It will un­
questionably facilitate the' study and 
ultimately increase the attendance of 
foreign students at the Institute, be­
cause It represents an organized ef- 
'fort for the increase of the value and 
pleasantness of the study of the for­
eign students at Tech.
As a chapter of the Corda Fratres 
Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs, 
which is the International Federation 
of Students, any member of this club 
will enjoy the hospitality and priv­
ileges of cosmopolitan clubs, to bo 
found In conjunction with the best In­
stitutions of higher learning In the 
United States and abroad.
It has boon the experience of other 
universities that American students 
form the majority of the membership 
of |;ho Cosmopolitan clubs. The phe­
nomenon can be explained very easily. 
Most of the studonts never traveled 
outside the United States. As a gen­
eral rule they do not have the occa­
sion of-becoming familiar with cur­
rent events and conditions in other 
countries. By becoming members o£

A BAND
Tech’s band was lost in the “mix-up” during, the stay of the- 
celebrated S. A. T. (J. and as yet has not been revived. There is 
plenty oli material here in school and plenty of need for a band 
Mr. Smith and Mr. Howe have done some good work in lining up 
material but there seems to be a “snag” somewhere. At least their 
labor has yielded no visible fruit.
• A good band is a one hundred percent “pep” generator and is 
a needed activity in this school. Two years ago Tech had a bant 
of sixty pieces, directed by E. (J. Sullivan, that was known all over 
the state but last year, it like -many other organizations, suffered 
from the needed discipline of the military authorities.
But those days are over. The new material, augmented by th 
last year’s players,*could, in a short time, be developed into a good 
representative college band. That is fine—we’ll have a band (V)

No, but I was there.
Many were there who did not sec the .game, that is sure. It i;

to encourage people to go to a game when one knows that the seeing

ALAN BRIGHT, Registrar.
Colonel Brooks desires to call attention to the former members 
of the S. A. T. ('. which have been discharged since April 6, 1937, 
that they are entitled lo a bonus from the Government of $00.00.
In order lo obtain this bonus they should write a letter addressed 
to “Zone Finance Officer, Lemon building, Washington, D. 
stating their service since April (>, 1017, and the date oli last dis­
charge and their present address to which they desire their bonus 
check lo be sent, and enclosing with this letter their discharge cer­
tificate or military order for discharge, and both if both were issued.
The Zone Finance Officer in Washington, I). I1., will cause checks 
to be drawn and mailed to I lie claimants in the order in which the 
claims have been received by him.
The discharge certificate will be returned to the soldier with the 
check.
About one million and a quarter persons are entitled to this 
bonus and it will take some time to write and mail this number of 
checks.
It is suggested that all of these letters should be registered.
Officers and soldiers discharged from camps or organizations are 
also entitled to this bonus and should apply in the same way.
and the camps.
Both of these propositions were 
granted.
The idea of a common basic course 
at this institution and probably at 
others is necessary in view of the 
fact that Freshmen students are not 
supposed to make the selection of 
.Room 162, Design | their future profession until the end 
of their Freshman year, so that if 
they were required at once to make 
their military, selection they might 
chose for example the engineers, and 
at the end of their first year they 
might find that their academic course 
would no longer fit them for the en­
gineers but would make them avail­
able for Field Artillery and unless 
a transfer could be effected they 
would be obliged to resign from the 
R. O. T. C. and their year’s work 
would go for nothing.
Thp recognizing of the'past work'«;, 
done by the Sophomores and Fresh­
men means that they have practical­
ly completed the necessary infantry 
work and that their future infantry 
work will be only enough to pre­
vent them forgetting that they have 
already learned. This means the 
practical elimination of the monotony 
of squad drill, which has proved so 
distasteful in the past. In addition 
to this it means that Sophomores 
and Freshmen will not' lose the 
work they have done in the past but 
will be eligible upon graduation for 
recommendations for commission» 
either in the reserve corps or in the 
regular service if they so desire.
Colonel Brooks strongly urged that 
the past work should be recognized 
So that the Sophomores next fall and 
the Freshmen in a year from the 
coming fall will be eligible for their 
commutation of rations at the rate 
of a. little over $0.40 a day which 
would apply not only during their at­
tendance at the university but also 
during their summer vacations. I-I 
was pleased to learn that this mau­
ler had already been taken up by 
the committee and that a bill had 
been presented in Congress to that 
effect but this hill failed, as Th many 
-others did, on account of the fili­
buster during the last days of Con­
gress. He received the assurance 
that the moment Congress re-con- 
venes, a hill would be r.e-in trod need 
and heartily supported, and the com­
mittee has every reason to believe 
that if will bo passed, and passed in 
time to make the money available 
for the fall term.
Members of the R. O. T. C. will 
ho furnished with certain equipment 
In the way of uniforms and other 
things, and they will be required to 
wear uniforms at drill only, at other 
times the wearing of uniforms will j 
be optional.
To give the students a little idea of 
what this means financially to them 
it has been figured that each man will 
receive during -the four years, prop­
erty valued at $167.32, commutation 
of subsistence for two years amount­
ing in cash to $326.00, and commuta­
tion during the summers amounting 
in cash to $54.00.
The members of the R. O. T. C. will 
also have the privilege of buying extra 
equipment at the Depot Quartermaster 
which will be a considerable saving.
Colonel Brooks while in Washington 
went to the Depot Quartermaster and 
bought a pair of cordovan dress shoe: 
for $9.65 which were the duplicate of 
the ones offered in civilian stores for 
$1S.00. Handsome gabardine uniforms 
which cannot be bought from any 
military tailor for less than $50.00 are 
offered at the Depot Quartermaster 
for $22.50.
The Engineer Corps, Signal Corps 
and Field Artillery are ready to ship 
immediately the military outfit neces­
sary to start the training at once up­
on the establishment of the units. In­
cidentally the Field Artillery equip­
ment will consist of a battery of mo­
torized Field Artillery and a number 
of horses to be used in teaching equi­
tation. A Sergeant and squad of men 
from the regular service will be de­
tailed to this university to take charge 
of tho care of the horses and equip­
ment.. It. can readily be imagined that 
the drill with motorized Field Artil­
lery operating under its own motive 
power will far outshine in interest 
iinything that could be done by infan- 
on foot and a parade of these

Corps and Field Artillery and the En­

onel Brooks lantern slides showing 
the actual work of these different 
units on the battlefield in France, and 
Colonel Brooks expects in a short 
time to exhibit these slides and to ex­
plain fully the advantages of each 
unit, so. that students can make up 
their minds intelligently what unit 
they would prefer from personal J f| 
choice and in consideration of their ~ 
adopted future profession. To avail 
himself of these advantages the stu­
dent must begin at once.
The whole consideration in estab­
lishing these different units is to offer 
to the Tech students, military work 
that will be interesting to them while 
working, and beneficial to them in the 
future.

FORBES HALL
'Plie chief social affair at Forbes 
Hall during the past week was a din­
ner party given by Miss Hart, Miss 
Sloan and Miss /Bigley, last Sunday 
evening. The menu—including the 
chicken—was a- fine example of the 
hostesses’ skill on K. P. The guests, 
and also all others present, enjoyed 
the event very much.
Miss Ruth McLeary, of New Castle, 
who will be remembered by many as. 
one at the Fifth Avenue I-Iall in 1916, 
was a week-end guest at Forbes Hall, 
and among those present at the Junior 
Prom Friday night.
The Southern Club held its first 
meeting for this year Thursday night, 
March 6, in the home of “Pop” Gage,

rived in time to join.in the short so­
cial hour which followed the meeting.

All together now—fifty-five “rahs” 
for the basket ball management. You 
baseball managers should take a tip 
from this basket ball gang, and ad­
vertise your admission price as fifty- 
five cents. After the first inning 
charge the rooters 55c more if they 
.care to stay. Charge again for the 
seventh inning stretch. If anyone is 
passing down Woodlawn avenue, 
charge them something. They prob­
ably beard the cheering and they owe 
you something. Sell the dirt that 
came off the spiked shoes Hans Wag­
ner wore in the 1909 championship

seems to belong to the Y. W. C. A.

3. Mild and wind will no longer ex­

4. Calories will be wiped out as ef-

STEEL RESEARCH LABORATORY 
AT CARNEGIE TECH PLANNED
(Continued From Page One) 
lated In Machinery Hall. The mill 
and'drive alone will cost about 
$100,000.
All the equipment entering Into 
the big research bureau will be fur­
nished by the steel companies inter 
ested in the project. Each one of 
these steel companies will be repre­
sented on the board of directors that 
will be created for the laboratory. 
Carnegie Institute of Technology will 
contribute the space and the staff.
Every problem encountered in the 
process of steel making In the fu­
ture will be submitted to the pro­
posed new laboratory for solution. 
At the same time the laboratory will 
work on new ideas for rolling steel, 
for the perfection of the quality, 
and, In a general way, elevate the, 
manufacture of steel to a higher 
standard of efficiency.
Steel Firms Agree.
England and Wales heretofore have 
laid claim to the creation of most of 
the processes utilized in the'steel 
industry throughout the world, and 
their achievements in this direction 
are attributed to close co-operation. 
There always has been a desire on 
the part of I lie American steel in­
dustry, it was said I.lie 6ther day, 
(o establish a co-operative laboratory, 
but the various interests invariably 
conflicted on "the man and the 
place.”
It is understood that Director Ar­
thur A. Hamerschlag and Prof. Willi­
bald Trinks of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology long have pictured a 
gigantic rolling mill research labora­
tory in connection with Tech, but 
have had considerable trouble inter­
esting the steel Industry in such a 
project because of the ever-present 
question 6f “the man and the place.” 
In other words, Dr. I-Iamersclilag and 
Prof. Trinks succeeded in impressing 
the steel manufacturers with the 
necessity of a co-operative labora­
tory, where all the ingenuity of the 
world’s leading steel center could 
be thrown together and work in 
harmony, but many of the details, 
principally the' location of such a 
laboratory and the directing head 
could not be agreed on by all inter­
ested, It Is said.
Several weeks ago Dr. Hamer­
schlag and Prof, Trinks and other 
engineers connected with the Carne­
gie Institute of Technology canvassed 
every steel company of any conse­
quence in the Pittsburgh district. 
The result of tills was a definite 
agreement on the part of more than 
a score of steel companies—the 
United States Steel Corporation sub­
sidiaries and leading independent 
concerns-—to create such an Institu­
tion under the auspices of the Carne­
gie Institute, of Technology.
All agreed, II. is understood, that 
“Billy” Shlnkle was the logical man 
to direct the worjc, with representa­
tives of all the steel companies iiv 
forested In the project forming a 
hoard of directors acting In an ad­
visory capacity. Dr. Hamerschlag 
and Prof, Trinks were told to go 
ahead with what,ever plans they had 
In mind, that the steel companies 
would furnish the equipment and the 
ilnances,
While the new Institution will be­
gin strictly as a. rolling mill re­
search laboratory, it. gradually will 
develop Into a gigantic bureau where 
all departments of steel making will 
he dealt with, and where a great staff 
of scientists will work day and night 
trying to evolve new ideas to revo­
lutionize steel making.
Mill Type Undecided.
It. has not been definitely decided 
yet just what type of rolling mill I 
will be installed in the laboratory. 
Its size will range between 12 and 
16 inches, and will be rigged up to 
operate as either a Belgian train or 
continuous mill. It will have three 
stands. It was made plain by the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
officials the other day that the pro­
posed laboratory is to be a labora­
tory in the strictest sense of the 
word, confined entirely to experi­
mental and research work. It will 
not be a teaching school, save in in­
stances, perhaps, where a steel com­
pany interested wants a man from 
its plant trained in a certain spec­
ialty or made familiar with a partic­
ular roll.
It is estimated that $30,000 will be 
required annually at the beginning to 
maintain the proposed laboratory. 
This amount will be materially in­
creased, however, as the capacity 
and the purposes of the institution 
develop. Mr. Skinkle. it is under­
stood, lias given little thought yet to 
his staff, but will take this matter 
into consideration after he lias plan­
ned his mill. Although only 37 years 
old, “Billy” Shlnkle already has at­
tained a name for himself In the 
steel-making Industry. Ho designed 
the 40-Inch blooming mill for Jones 
& Laughlln at their Allqulppa plant, 
and has accomplished a number of 
other feats in industrial engineer­
ing construction during the last few
research laboratory because he rep­
resents both the theoretical and 
practical side of the steel industry. 
He worked in steel mills and in ma 
chine ‘shops 15 years, then entered 
the night school of Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology, graduatting with 
the class of 1917. After his gradua­
tion he became Identified with the 
Schoen plant of the Carnegie Steel 
Company, and later was engineer of 
the shell department of the: now 
abandoned Neville Island ordnance 
plant. Since work on the Neville 
Island plant has been abandoned, 
however, he has been transferred to 
the Carnegie Steel Company, from 
which he now resigns. He is the 
first Canegle Tech graduate to be. 
called back •-'to do research work at 
that institution.
MOVIES WERE TAKEN OF WAGNER AT TECH
COSMOPOLITAN CLUB
HOLDS FIRST MEETING
(Continued From Page One.) 
such clubs they increase their knowl­
edge and broaden their views. The 
reason, therefore, is of. a cultural na­
ture.
At present there is a particular rea­
son, quite as strong as the one’ just 
mentioned, why the Americans should 
become members of such a movement. 
It is universally admitted by the lead­
ers of 'commerce and industry, that 
the U. S: will not be able to avoid the 
social troubles which result from 
heavy unemployment, nor will the na­
tion be able to use its increased in­
dustrial productive capacity and the 
merchant marine, made necessary by 
the demands of war, unless the nation 
goes out; for foreign markets. If 
nothing else the club will stimulate 
thought along these lines, by lectures 
from members of foreign commissions 
who come to America and incidentally 
to Pittsburgh, and which commissions 
aim at1 the establishment of stronger 
economic relations between this coun­
try and other countries. The Chani- 
ber of Commerce of Pittsburgh has 
expressed its desire to co-operate, in 
the fullest extent, in this matter.
National nights will be conducted 
which will feature the interesting 
characteristics of foreign countries.
All day, night, men and women, stu­
dents and officers of Tech, are cordial­
ly invited to join in the movement.
During the first meeting, which was 
held on March 5, officers were elected 
as follows:
GEO. A. SMAINIS, President.
A. W. PRINCE, Vice Presdent. 
J. BRAVERMAN, Secretary.
• ,T. C. GRESHEN, Treasurer.
While movie men turned their 
cranks Hon us- Wagner, veteran base­
ball star and now general trainer of 
j athletics at the institution, swung his 
tried and true bat, run the bases, slide 
and perform other baseball stunts at 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
Monday afternoon.
Dr. Thomas S. Baker, the new sec­
retary of the school, invited all the 
large and small motion picture firms 
of the city, who sent their movie 
photographers to catch the move­
ments of Honus when he made his 
bow to college baseball.
Because the school administration 
obtained a man of such renown in liis 
j profession as Wagner to coach the 
j baseball team if. is expected that an 
j unusually large squad will be on hand 
| to try for places on the team. Dr.
: Baker thinks Honus will be unusually 
j successful in his efforts to teach 
Tech’s young baseball idea “how to 
: shoot” and to throw Inslioots and out- 
! shoots, and looks for a successful sea- 
| pon on the diamond for the institu­
tion.
Dr. Baker, the faculty and all the 
students seem proud of the fact that | 
a celebrity of Wagner’s fame is to 
coach its team, and all seem to want 
everybody to know/that he is identi­
fied with the institution.

chine gun division or the “Suicide 
Squad.” After relating Ills expe­
riences in the cavalry the members 
of the club unanimously, agreed that 
the “Fighting Q. M. • C.” was their 
branch of the service in the future.
The club next heard rrom Dean 
Connelly who was the sole sympa­
thizer of Mr. Prevls for the dean too 
had a. taste of the cavalry in his 
younger days. The dean’s speech 
was greatly enjoyed by the members 
for all were Ignorant of the fact that 
the dean had been under army disci­
pline. We know now why he is al­
ways termed “One of the boys.”
At eight o’clock the party journey­
ed forth to the Davis, where the 
show was enjoyed by all especially 
the “Dance Revue.”
GIRLS HEAR TALKS BY FACULTY ON SPIRIT

The faculty of Margaret Morrison 
took a hand in the booster campaign 
in the assembly last Tuesday, when 
Miss Pany gave a.-short talk on col­
lege spirit. The girls learned they 
were far too modest and retiring, in 
fact very much like the proverbial 
shrinking violet. Miss Pany does not 
approve of this. To get the most out 
of college, we must step forward and 
give .our time and our efforts to it. 
Tech cannot gain anything from our 
mere presence on the campus. Miss 
Pany defined the ¿vords “boost” and 
“spirit” in a manner which gave a 
clear understanding of what each 
should expect from school life. It 
also made us realize what she had ex­
pected from her definition assign­
ments in Plebe English. Among other 
things, she defined “boost” as a word 
to be applied only to something alive. 
So, if our school and spirit is not 
alive we will have to stop boosting 
and start; to push.
Dean Breed reinforced Miss Party's 
remarks with a few words concerning 
the value of college life outside the 
classroom. She, however, warned us 
against the Idea that studies might in­
terfere with our college education.

One of the initial boosts in the 
matter of athletics at M. M. C. C. was 
the splendid attendance at the inter­
class basket ball game on Tuesday, 
March 4. Rooters from all the class­
es came out, and between a snappy 
game, a lot of enthusiasm and the 
noise of the Freshmen, it was an 
afternoon well worth remembering.
The final score was 35 to 9, the 
Junior Freshman team coming out 
the victors. Both teams put up a 
splendid fight—which was one of the 
main causes for the many outbursts 
on the part of the spectators.
The Freshmen continually kept ad­
monishing their team with "Your 
pep! You’ve got it now, keep it! 
Don’t you dare lose it!” Now it is 
up to the rest of the school to do 
the same thing. Keep your eye 
Tastened on the bulletin board on 
the fourth floor and when the next 
game is scheduled be there with all 
your pep.
M. M. C. S. FACULTY START BASKET BALL TEAM
M. M. C. S. faculty has also caught
the booster spirit- Many of them
have turned out for a faculty basket 
hall team, whose excellence promises 
to give all the- class teams pretty 
keen competition. They have al­
ready met the Junior class with 
“pep” in spite of defeat) that tells of 
great tilings for the future. Basket 
ball Is getting to be a first-class reg­
ular and inspiriting institution at 
Margaret Morrison. Among the facul­
ty on the team are Miss Sturtevant, 
Miss Leonard, Miss Svenson, Miss
Winchester, Miss Briggs and Miss 
Roenigk.
Our works are the mirror wherein 
the spirit first sees its natural linea­
