NEW COMMANDANT SECURED TO DIRECT STUDENT
Captain John D. Meyer As­
sumed Charge Last Mon­
day Morning and Selects 
Student Officers
The mobilization oE the Eighteenth 
Regiment, N. G. P., took from Tech 
her Commandant, almost before-« he 
had begun his work. The students who 
had been pushing the movement took 
charge in the interval and under the 
direction of Prof. Keller, kept the 
drilling at full speed, and in the mean­
time, started the search for a new 
‘Commandant. Through Mr. Frew, of 
the Board of Trustees, it was found 
possible to secure Mr. Meyer. Fol­
lowing a conference with Director 
Hamerschlag, last Monday, Captain 
Meyer assumed charge, and began the 
selection of’ his student officers.
Captain Meycr-has had considerable 
experience in the National Guard, 
having been a line captain for a num­
ber of years, and is now upon the re­
serve lists.
Because of the press of his business 
affairs, Captain Meyer has had to limit 
the amount of time he spends upon 
the campus. In order, then, to secure 
the greatest possible results, he has 
had given him complete authority to 
«direct the military work, and to select 
such men to assist him as he thinks 
necessary. The results of the written 
¦examination held last Friday for pros­
pective officers, together with the 
ability rating given the candidates at 
last Sunday’s meeting, were placed in 
the hands of the Commandant for his 
assistance. By the time The Tartan 
reaches its readers, Captain Meyer 
will have the organization of the com­
panies under way and plans laid for 
the immediate use of the arms upon 
their arrival from the Arsenal.

QUALIFICATION DAY APPROACHING RAPIDLY
The clay of emancipation for the 
Plebes will soon be here. On this day, 
the Freshmen are formally accepted 
by the upper classmen as true Tech 
men. Up to now the Plebes have been 
on probation, as it were. They have 
had to live up to certain regulations, 
which were designed to imbue in them 
the true Tech spirit. In recognition of 
their adherence to these rules the 
upper classmen will relieve them of 
further regulations and place them on 
an equality with themselves.
The day will be observed with fit­
ting exercises. During it the coffin in 
which the various articles of discarded 
wearing apparel are to be burned, will 
lie in state. A funeral procession will 
take place in which all classes will 
participate.
On this day the 1920 link will be 
welded on to the Carnegie Tech chain 
of classes. This chain contains a link 
for each class that has entered these 
schools, one being added each year.
The Plebes are awaiting this day 
with impatience, for it will be with a 
sigh of relief that they toss their hats, 
ties, socks, and regulations into the 
flames.
The exact date for Qualification 
Day has not been decided upon, but it 
. will probably be in the near future.
SENIORS OF M. M. C. S.TO HOJJBIG DANCE
The Twentieth Century Club will be 
the setting for the formal dance to be 
given by the Seniors of the M. M. C. S. 
on next Friday evening, May 4.
The chaperones are Miss Parry, 
Miss Collingwood and Miss Caverly. 
Miss Helen Wassel is chairman of the 
committee on arrangements.
Plans are now under way, it was 
learned, to have Congress appropriate 
the necessary funds to enable the War 
Department to pay all persons attend­
ing the Officers’ Training Camp to be 
started on May 8. The plans will be 
carried out in the form of an amend­
ment to the pending Army Appropria­
tion Bill, which is now in conference. 
The amendment was decided upon at 
a conference between officials of the 
War Department and members of the 
House Military Affairs Committee. 
There is little doubt in the minds of 
members of Congress in touch Avith 
the situation that Congress will au­
thorize the expenditure.
If, as is expected, therefore, this bill 
passes the House before May 8, the 
members of the Officers’ Reserve 
Corps will be ordered into the service 
under full pay and will report at the 
training camp on that basis.
To show the exact scheme intended 
the following order, which has been 
sent to the Department Commander, 
was made public:
“Make necessary preparations to or­
der all reserve officers of infantry, 
cavalry, field artillery, and coast ar­
tillery to duty at training, camps or­
dered April 17, on active service, un­
der Sec. 36, of the National Defense 
Act.
“This will put them on the same sta-

MIDDLE CLASSMEN 
HOLD SPRING DANCE
A most pleasant evening was en­
joyed by those present in Carnegie 
Union last Friday, when the Middle 
Classmen of the Industries School held 
their spring dance. About eighty 
couples were present, including also, 
men from the Lower and Upper 
classes. The Nossokoff-Maggio Or­
chestra furnished the music and the 
program consisted of twenty numbers 
and four extras, with a generous 
quota of encores. s
The chaperones were Dean and Mrs. 
Connelley, Prof. and Mrs. C. C. Leeds, 
Prof. and Mrs. C. G. Dunnells, Prof. 
and Mrs. H. A. Calderwood and Mr. 
and Mrs. H. L. Gage.
COMEDY DISGUISE REVEL TO BE SECOND FEATURE DANCE FOR DESIGN
War and war preparation certainly 
hasn’t calmed the spirit of revel in 
the aspiring artists of Applied Design. 
In the corridors of that school on the 
evening of Founder’s Day, Thursday, 
April 26, will b.e seen one of those 
dance spectacles for which the stu­
dent body of that school has become 
famous among artists throughout 
America.
The thought arose in the feverish 
and fanciful brains of many of the 
students that the coming of spring 
should be celebrated in some unusual 
manner. So, as the ancients com­
memorated this event in dance and 
song, Design prepared to follow suit. 
But the dance in itself is too ordinary 
for the celebration of Spring by a De­
sign student, so it was decided that 
the comedy element should be added, 
and that it should be made a dis­
guise revel. The student body felt it
could not give such an elaborate af­
fair as the Slavonic Ball, with wall 
decoration, costume and banquet, but 
that an unusually good time could be 
had by comic face disguise, and the 
addition of costume if the reveler felt 
so inclined; but that each participant 
should be obliged to conceal his iden­
tity in some manner other than wear­
ing the usual black mask. The only 
requirement in costume or make-up is 
that it must be “something funny,” 
either ancient or modern, providing 
that the reveler covers at least three- 
quarters of his identity with some 
other material than circus paint or 
burnt cork.
In this dance there is every oppor­
tunity for the expression of those 
flighty fancies and hallucinations such 
as can originate only in the heated 
cranium of an artistically tempera-

NIGHT DESIGN MEN 
ORGANIZE NEW CLUB
Members of Illustrating and 
Painting Department Hope 
to Meet in Summer
On Friday evening, April 20, about 
twenty-five students in the night 
classes of Design, Illustrating and 
Painting met in the Illustrating Room, 
to perfect a new organization.
This organization, which will be 
known as the Nite Tech Design Club, 
has among its members, students who 
have noticed with much regret the ap­
proach of the closing date of school. 
Being inspired by the fellowship ex­
isting in great measure among them­
selves, they have been doing some mis­
sionary work with the sole purpose of 
augmenting their numbers and form­
ing a club. Their efforts were re­
warded, for, it seemed that all were 
of the same mind, that the school year 
was all too short and that they should 
unite their efforts and meet during the 
summer months, to do outdoor sketch­
ing and maintain interest in art work 
until school opens in the fall.
The foundation of the club is very 
good, all members are enthused and 
appreciate the help derived by co­
operation, have resolved to enlist all 
the night students of the Design 
School in their ranks, irrespective of 
whether they are beginners or ad­
vanced students.
The club proposes to secure the 
services of a good instructor for the 
summer months, who will accompany 
the club on sketching tours.
The officers elected on Friday even­
ing were as follows: Fred C. Wil-
harm, president; Paul Schweinberg, 
vice president; Miss Anna Kennedy, 
corresponding and recording secre­
tary; Miss Ruth Querry, treasurer.
Several committees were appointed 
as follows: By-Law Committee will

TECH LOSES FIRST 
GAME TO JUNIATA
Pitchers Duel is Broken Up 
In the Twelfth—Doherty 
Stars at Short
In one of the cleanest and most in­
teresting games ever played on Tech 
field. Juniata defeated the Skibos 2 to 
1 in the twelfth inning of an over-time 
game. Singles by Fowler and Flory, 
an error and a sacrifice by Breininger 
produced the necessary run.
The large crowd which turned out 
saw a brand of baseball far above the 
average college game. The fielding 
Avas clean and snappy on both. Many 
star plays were made, ilanlcin, Juni­
ata’s middle-fielder, ran away back, 
leaped into the air and speared Kes- 
ner’s hot liner with one hand. Yeager 
rail up among the rocks in certer-field 
and made a pretty catch of Rankin's 
fly. Doherty risked getting spiked 
several times to get his man stealing 
second.
The game developed that Coach Mc­
Cullough has two real pitchers in Hird 
and Lyons. Both performed very 
creditably and were strongest with 
men on bases. Hird takes* his Lime 
and winds up long. Lyons has a fast 
ball, which he used effectively, strik­
ing out 5 men. The whole team 
fielded well but were weak with the 
bat. Nearly all grounders proved easy 
outs because of the soft grounds.
Tech’s run was due to two errors 
by LaAVson, a hit by Yeager, and a 
passed ball, Miller scoring.
Score by Innings.
First Inning.
Juniata—Blair struck out; Rankin 
popped to ICesner; Klein lined to Cos­

DRAMATISTS PRESENT 
PLAY OF STUDENT AUTHOR
Initial Performance of “The 
Weevils” Receives Favora­
ble Comment from Critics
The first performance, v»n any stage 
of this very interesting three act 
play, Avas given at a matinee on 
Tuesday afternoon in the theater of 
the school of applied design before a 
large and appreciative student au­
dience.
Here and there Avere sprinkled a 
feAV educators and drama “fiends”— 
but on the whole, it was a student 
affair from beginning to end. The 
play is a collaboration, by Howard 
Smith, a third year drama man and 
Miss Sarah Bennett, a member of the 
Plebe drama class. The cast Avas 
made up from members of all classes 
of this department and every mem­
ber of that cast laid himself out to 
make it go—and it “Avent.” The 
grand climax, the duel, at the end 
of the second act, Avas the signal for 
an explosion of approval not equaled 
since Steen’s memorable performance 
of “Dogberry.” The applause loud 
and long was punctuated by cries of 
author”—“author”—and it being evi­
dent that the audience Avas deter­
mined that the play should not pro­
ceed. Miss Bennett and Mr. Smith 
were literally dragged upon the stage 
to receive the tributes of apprecia­
tion from their fellow-students in 
painting, music and architecture, 
everyone of Avhom experienced with 
them the triumph of the concrete 
ideal—that rare thing in the life of 
any artist.
It was one of the most significant 
indications of the solidarity of the 
student body in design, and BhoAVS 
the right spirit. Minor defects were 
passed over in the general joy over 
“something accomplished—something 
done.” Truly it was good to be

CONTESTS CANCELLED 
IN TRACK AND TENNIS
Dennison and Syracuse Drop 
Athletics for Remainder 
of Year
The Avar dropped two bombs in the 
Tech camp last Aveek in the form of 
cancellation of sports. Dennison Uni­
versity, Avith Avhom the Plaid sprinters 
had arranged a dual track and field 
meet at Dennisons’ field, on May 5, 
has seen fit to drop all athletic activ­
ities for the remainder of the season, 
due to the Avar conditions.
Syracuse has likeAvise cancelled its 
tennis match here for June 5, and 
some other school will probably be 
substituted. Negotiations are under 
Avay to arrange a dual meet with the 
University of Pittsburgh, since the 
Navy has cancelled on them.
As yet none of the schools named 
on the baseball schedule have discon­
tinued athletics, and probably will not.
DECORATION DEPT. HAS 
NEW CREDIT SYSTEM
Instead of the old credit system of 
past years, a new system is under con­
sideration for the coming year. It is 
proposed to employ a system more 
flexible and better adapted to the re­
quirements oE an art school. The new 
plan will give ratings by mentions 
and medals. The proposition is up be­
fore the board now. More definite in- 
formation will be given in the next 
issue.

NIGHT STUDENTS OF FOUR SCHOOLS UNITE FOR FIRST ANNUAL DANCE
A. C. Bennett, presides of the fifth 
I year night class, was married to Miss 
Debolt, of the M. M. C. S.
FolloAving the Tartan’s editorial 
suggestion for closer social associa­
tions between the various groups 
composing Tech, the night students 
of the four schools are making ar­
rangements to "get together."
A committee composed of represen­
tatives from each school is planning 
to hold a dance the first of what is 
hoped XIill bo an annual affair, on 
Wednesday evening, May 9, from 
8:30 to 12:30, at the Carnegie Union. 
Admission by cards, for which there 
will be no tax. The expense of the 
dance is to be defrayed by certain 
students in each of the schools, XILN2 
will contribute voluntarily to a fund 
raised for this purpose. The affair 
Avill be an entirely informal gather­
ing of students out for a good time
Each student is to bring his (or her) 
partner who need not necesasrily ba 
a Tech student. Should it so hap­
pen that any of the men are not 
sufficiently fortunate tp have a girl 
for the occasion, they are requested 
to report this fact to one of the com­
mittee who XI ill do his best to supply 
the deficiency.
In order to complete the arrange­
ments the committee request each 
student desiring to attend to notify 
their respective class presidents at 
once and secure their admission 
cards as no cards XILLL be given out 
after Friday evening, May 4.
The committee of arrangements 
are Miss Sarah F. Rubenstein for M. 
Mv C. S., Mr. R. J. Patterson for In­
dustries, Messrs. K. B. Webber and 
Dyer for Design, Messrs. A. C. Ben- 
Zett arid W. B. Skinkle for Science.

A NOVEL PREPAREDNESS PLAN
In the lives of nations as well as individuals, there eomc 
times when the need for radical changes in their mode oi existence 
is too pressing to be neglcctcd. The usual tendency of society is 
to learn new methods and processes only when forced to do so l)y 
irresistible forces.. Such a time is now at hand in the life of Amer­
ica, and upon 1 lie present generation falls the duty of rearranging 
our national life. The old days of extravagance in our private and 
public affairs are gone. The burden of the war will fall almost as 
heavily upon America as upon the rest of the world, and the duty 
of her citizens is to conserve her resources, both in men, time, and 
materials. How can Tech men help in this work?
First, by taking an active part in prosecution of the war 
through any of the military agencies of the government. About 
fifty men have already withdrawn from school to enter the various 
branches of the military establishment. Many more arc preparing 
to do the same thing and nearly all the rest are at least learning 
the rudiments of military science in the morning drills. Our men 
arc also doing their share in helping to increase the supplies of 
materials of both war and peace. Not the least of these is Hie pro- 
due,lion of food. It is estimated by government officers that our 
country must raise enough food to supply not only ourselves, but 
fifty million people ol! our Allies also. This, means just one thing. 
The farmers ol! our country .must have assistance, not only in the 
harvest, but through the planting and growing seasons as well.
The national and state governments plan that college men who 
have not the necessary technical ability to be iudespcnsable else 
whore, can be used in this work.
To this end, the national government has addressed a circular 
to Dr. EsijueiTc outlining a plan ol’ organizing students into groups 
ol1 live or ten each, those groups to be sent to various parts of 
country and be paid tho wage current in that district. Dr. Esquerrc 
will liavo placed this matter before the Sophomore and Plobe classcs 
and if they desire to help this summer in this work, lie will start 
the necessary arrangements at once.
THE RED CROSS DANCE
Next Friday evening tho Music Hall Foyer will again bo the 
scene ol’ one ol! tho Institute’s most popular social events, this 
time informal. Tho dance proposed for tho benefit ol! the M. M 
C. S. Bed Cross unit deserves the support of every student, not 
only because ol! the very excellent use to which proceeds will be 
placed, but because of the assured excellence of the dunce itself, 
No more appropriate place could have been secured, and every 
other detail of the dance has received careful attention. There­
fore, every student is urged to help in what will probably bo the 
last, all-scliool affair of this year.
Stale Frat News

RICHARD II POSTPONED UNTIL MAY FIRST
It was necessary to postpone the 
first performance of Richard II. until 
Tuesday evening, May 1. In memory 
of Shakespeare's birthday, a dress re­
hearsal of the first three acts of the 
play was given on the evening of 
April 23. Richard II. is the most 
elaborately costumed play the school 
has yet given. The credit of design­
ing and purchasing of materials is due 
to Lucy Barton and Catherine Jones.
"The Weevils,” by Sara Bennett and 
Howard Smith, will be given before 
the Drama League Convention on 
Wednesday evening of this week. 
After the performance of “The Wee­
vils,” last Thursday evening, the Dra­
ma Department gave a reception for 
the authors and cast of the play and 
their friends.
On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Stevens 
will lecture on the work of the school. 
His play, "The Flight of Deirdre,” will 
be performed to illustrate Plebe work.
these will be an Oriental dance by 
Nicholas Hans Muller, accompanied 
with Oriental music by Arleigh Wil­
liamson, Charlie Sorber and Van 
Sickle. Music will be furnished by 
an alumnist and the old stand-by of 
Design, Herb Gilg, with a Nirella Or­
chestra.
The Dean and Faculty of the school 
are invited, as well as the Director, 
the Administration Officers, the deans 
of the other schools, and a few pro­
fessional artists. Mr. and Mrs. Henry 
I-Iornbostle will come on from New 
York to attend.
The officers of the student body 
wanted to make this event invitational 
to students of the other four schools, 
but, as the dance is to be held in the 
corridors of the school, it was found 
that there is a rule against charging 
admission, or assessing any person 
other than a student of the school.
Margaret Morrison, Science and In­
dustry students have still the oppor­
tunity of being present. Each Design 
student will be assessed, and he or 
she has the privilege of inviting a 
partner or partners from outside. In 
this way the committee hopes that 
many students of the other schools 
may share in the good time through 
the invitation of individual students.
M.M.C. S. ASSEMBLY HEAR iTALKS
At the General Assembly, last week, 
Dr. Blair, Miss Esther Smith, secre­
tary of the Pittsburgh branch of the 
Collegiate Bureau for Women, and 
Miss I-Iolmes, head of the Secretarial 
Department gave the principal talks. 
Miss Hinman, head of the Costume 
Economics Department, asted as chair­
man.
Dr. Blair was the first, speaker. She 
told of her recent trip to Washington 
and advised the girls of the necessary 
steps to be taken in order to become 
a Nurses’ Aid.
Miss Smith spoke of the necessity of 
finding the way In Which one can as­
sist most, and they go ahead. She 
showed the harm, rather than good, 
of making a misfit of oneself.
Miss riolmes told of what the school 
was doing. A now course has been 
introduced In the Secretarial Depart­
ment; which will last eight weoks and 
tho purpose of which is to. fit women 
who already possess some business 
knowlodgo to fill men’s positions in 
offices.
Tho social service course is doing 
war relief work. There will be a 
room In the Costume Economics De­
partment set apart for all who are able 
and willing to sew for soldiers each 
morning from 8 until 9 o’clock.
A CORRECTION
We wish to correct an error pub­
lished in our issue of April 18, in the 
article headed "Art Students Take a 
Trip to New York,” writing of going 
to the Home of Tiffany Silverware. 
There is no such concern. There are 
three different and separate corpora­
tions—one known as Tiffany & Co. 
jewelers; another as Tiffany Studios, 
the decorators, and lastly, Tiffany 
Furnaces, where the beautiful Favrile 
glass is made. Mr. De Quelin was for 
ten years chief designer, art director 
and manager of the decorative depart­
ment of the Tiffanjr Studios, where the 
Pilgrims were taken to see the various 
art productions and decorative work 
done under the direction of the well- 
known artist, Mr. Louis C. Tiffany.

there.- Later performances ran more 
smoothly—some things were done 
more artistically, but the exciting 
spontaniety, the hesitant expectancy 
which wait upon the untried were 
absent from all but this first per­
formance.
The real literary value of the play 
lies tucked away in the text that ac­
companies the dialogue, which is 
well written and unusually expressed. 
Here is one on music—apropos of 
Imogen’s attempt to allure Philipp 
through her playing—"music is heard 
from the distance. It is a subtle 
thing which some one is playing. 
Subtle—creeping over one like a 
warm perfume—sucking one’s will: 
pouring in the crevices of one’s 
moral armor. Music, that treacher­
ous weapon of Fate—wafts in asking 
one only to forget, to remember, to 
grow hot, to grow cold, to overwhelm 
ill clear thinking—to turn one’s de­
cisions to water, to allow our emo­
tions to thrum the chords of our 
hearts, to cause our whole being to 
throb with the universe.”
Its title, "The Weevils,” is a little 
puzzling at first and leads one far 
afield as to what to expect, although 
a note on the destructive nature of 
the weevil proves it to be a very apt 
term for spies—for of course it is a 
"war” play. It takes place in a 
small college town in one of the 
gulf states and more precisely, in the 
home of Professor Larnier, a French­
man of the old school, who is devot­
ing the last days of his life to the 
rearing of liis orphaned grandchil­
dren, Antoinette and Philllpe; and it 
is not too much to say, that the suc­
cess of the play depends largely upon 
the interpretation given to this char­
acter. Mr. Frederic McConnell, to 
whom the role was entrusted, left lit­
tle to he desired in the faithful de­
lineation of this interesting old gen­
tleman, romantically patriotic, child-, 
ishly trusting and at the same time, 
not unacquainted with the tempta­
tions which beset the foot of youth 
and eager to save his grandson from 
the abyss that threatens to engulf 
him. One of the very strongest 
scenes in the play is where he turns 
on the stair landing and looks down 
on the irresolute Philip, saying 
"That night in Marsailles, I needed 
some one to tell me to be a man. 
Fifty years ago. How our life goes. 
How it goes!” It but adds one 
more to the list of his successes. Mr 
Hubbard Kirkpatrick’s "Phillip” was 
well received and made an excellent 
foil for Miss Katherine Jones’ 
"Tony,” his small vixen of a sister, 
who was as active as he was indo­
lent. She made a very interesting 
and charming "Tony.” Miss Hazel 
Beck as her friends "Ola Drurret,” 
through whose sagacity the "Wee­
vils” were finally discovered, is, in 
the words of Mr. Morse, “a clever 
girl” and the professor adds, “keen 
as a sword blade.”
“George,” the old negro servant, 
was an excellent piece of character 
work in the hands of Nicholas Mul­
ler. His “make-up” was all that 
could be desired, and being a real 
southerner he had no trouble with 
the dialect, which was more or less 
of a stumbling block to the rest of 
the cast. Carl B. Reed “sure nuff” 
got away with it pretty successfully 
as "Billv Cornliill,” who followed up 
the “Weevils” and finally brought 
them to their doom. Mr. Reed has 
given a good account of himself in 
every role which he has essayed in 
his brief career. He has a veiT good 
voice which he uses with discretion 
and lie gives. cnrefill attention to his 
ennunciation, one of the sure ave­
nues to success.
There remain to - be considered “the 
Weevils.” Mr. and Mrs. Morse, Ger­
man spies, who impose themselves 
upon the hospitality of Prof. Larnieiv 
Mrs. Morse, a languid lady of twenty- 
nino, “who makes fools out of boys— 
boys who can not decide to be men” 
—us the professor warns Phillip—is 
very cleverly done by Miss Ena Lew­
is. It is not a pleasant role in any 
sense. “Mr. Morse,” the spy. was 
entrusted to Richard Mansfield IT, 
who made his first appearance be­
fore an audience. To the speculative 
mind this fact gave' an added inter­
est to the performance, because of 
the illustrious career of his father, 
whose name became a synonym for
ard Mansfield in “Old Heidleburg” 
can ever forget the pathos of it? 
He has his father’s brow and expres­
sion about the eyes—let us hope he 
also possesses the same rare talent 
which shall give the same joy to an­
other generation. He labored under 
the handicap of being the son of so 
distinguished a father, for quite un­
consciously, one’s expectations were 
unreasonably high, but he came 
through the ordeal quite successfully 
and made “Mr. Morse” quite an in­
teresting character, being particular­
ly good in the little intimate scene 
with Mrs. Morse where he discusses 
and incidentally “cusses” her numer­
ous amours. .“Dicky will do,” was 
the verdict handed down by the stu­
dent body.
The-authors are to be congratulated 
upon the success of their joint effort 
and here is hoping that it may find 
itself on Broadway and line their 
pockets with gold. A very, important 
item in the success of the play from 
a pictorial standpoint was the stage 
setting, a hall in a southern mansion 
with the stairway, visible. • It lent 
atmosphere to the play and was most 
artistically conceived, as it was most 
of Mr. J. Woodman Thompson’s work.

Last Friday night the Plebe class of 
the M. M. C. S. gave a mask ball for 
the girls of their school. The girls 
were arrayed in interesting costumes, 
which made the affair very attractive. 
A picnic lunch was served and the

IBASICMILITARYCOURSE
LESSON NO. THREE
MILITARY TYPOGRAPHY
Modern warfare is largely conduct­
ed on maps, and the art of war is 
taught in time of peace by means of 
situations which have been assumed 
and which are worked out in con­
nection with- maps. In the United 
States service there has been within 
the past few years a marked increase 
in the use of maps for map problems, 
map. maneuvers—also known as. the 
War Game—and in the practical field 
maneuvers of federal and state 
troops. No soldier is properly pre­
pared to become, an officer unless 
he has a thorough knowledge of mil­
itary topography so that he can in­
stantly read a military map.
A study of the development of the 
science of war, from the time when 
battles were fought in dense forma­
tions. of limited extension to the 
huge battle, fields of the European 
war, whose fronts extend hundreds 
of miles, shows a constantly increas­
ing dependence by military com­
manders upon maps. In all large 
armies- maps are used at headquar­
ters by commanders 1 conducting ma­
jor operations, by subordinate com­
manders to supplement the ground 
they can see, and by commanders of 
small bodies of troops acting inde­
pendently. In every case;, actual prob­
lems of war are worked out in pret­
ty much, the same manner that map 
problems and maneuvers are handled' 
in time of peace. In the Russo-Ja­
panese war only three of the large 
battles were fought between field ar­
mies, Mukden, Sha-ho, and Liao-Yarig. 
There were, however, thousands of 
small engagements in which the 
maps of subordinate commanders 
played vital parts. The same is true 
of the European war, where every 
theater of war has been liberally 
mapped by all the armies engaged, 
and maps issued to officers and non­
commissioned officers. A knowledge 
of map reading is, therefore, indis­
pensable to all officers and non-com­
missioned officers. This does not im­
ply merely the ability to laboriously 
dig out the meaning of a map, but 
in the ability to quickly grasp the 
features of the ground.. The map 
reader should be able not only to 
find a road from a map, and to deter­
mine distances, but he should know 
what are the slopes of the ground, 
steepness of the grades of roads, 
and thé relative heights of hills. He 
must, in short, be able to form a per­
fect mental picture of the natural, 
physical features of the country as 
though he were actually on the 
ground itself.
This facility of map reading is not 
gained without much careful study, 
and it is desired that students of this 
course pay particular attention to 
every lesson, working to acquire a 
thorough knowledge of each. It may 
be possible that you already know 
something of map reading, but do 
not let this interfere with a thor­
ough study of each lesson.
Accompanying this lesson are two 
sections of the Gettysburg-Antietam 
topographical map, reduced from the 
12-inch War Game map. by the en­
gineer department of the Army Serv­
ice School, Fort Leavenworth, Kan­
sas. The Gettysburg-Antietam map 
is used for map maneuvers at the 
Army Service Schools, and a large 
number 3w sheets 3w it have been
completed. This map covers a diver-I 
sified tract of typical American ter­
rain, comprising all the features nec­
essary- to impart topographical in­
struction, including roads, farming 
land, fields, orchards, hills, chains of 
mountains with numerous forests, all 
splendidly adapted to represent any 
kind of warfare. Another map which 
will be used in this course will be 
the topographical map of the vicinity 
of Fort Leavenworth. Kansas, which 
has been compiled from surveys 
made by student oflicers of the Army 
Staff College.
The student should immediately 
begin a careful study of the maps 
which accompany this course. At 
first the results of his study will be 
meagre, but it is important at the 
outset to examine the maps careful­
ly, even if you have not reached that 
point in the course where their read­
ing is accomplished with complete 
understanding. You will study in 
this lesson conventional signs, and 
after learning the simpler map sym­
bols, take the map and pick out its 
different features, such as grass, 
trees, roads, villages, towns, orchards 
and bridges. You will notice curved 
lines all over the maps. They are 
known as contours, which will be ex­
plained in a subsequent lesson, it 
will pay you to take your military 
maps out every day and study them. 
At first, 011 account of limited knowl­
edge, they will be obscure, but as 
the lessons unfold and you begin to 
master the details of the subject, the 
military map will gradually become 
absolutely clear, and reading its vari­
ous features will become second na­
ture to you.
In conjunction with this study of 
topography, the student is urged to 
exercise a little personal observation 
and look around him at the natural 
physical features of the country in 
which he lives. A good method of 
practice in the study of topography 
is to go to -some point possessing 
a good view of country covered with 
a variety of natural, and artificial 
features. Study this landscape for a 
few minutes, then face away from 
the country you have observed, and 
try to recall all of the features you 
have seen, such as location and di­
rection of hills, valleys, rivers, roads, 
railroads, telephone and telegraph 
lines, and the location and dimension 
of bridges^ etc.
You will observe in the study of 
the text certain conventional signs, 
which are used on military maps. 
There are other abbreviations which 
are also used and which you should 
memorize, in order to aid you in 
reading military maps. These abbre­
viations are given in several works 
used in this course, but we-will re­
produce them here for your conve­
nience. The list is as follows:

Silver Lake Assembly, N. Y. In dis­
tributing his work, Mr. Howard in­
cludes the following letter:
Bureau of Education, Washington,
_ February 9, 1917. 
My dear Mr..Howard:
I wish to thank you for the copy of 
your poem, “Columbia.” I have read 
it with very great interest. I sincere­
ly hope that you will find means of 
publishing it in such a way as to give 
it the widest distribution.
I wish it might find its way into all 
the schools of the country.
Yours, .sincerely,
P. P. CLAXTON.

cation.
COLUMBIA.
(Tune: Auld Lang Syno) 
Behold our loved Columbia 
Arrayed in nature's host,
The sunshine decks her raidiant crown, 
The morning star her breast;
With Flag of Liberty enwrapped'— 
Bright folds that Peace lias furled— 
Emblazoned with the light of Truth 
And hope of all the world!
Pacific sings her golden song 
Upon thy sunset shore,
Atlantic’s wave of Liberty 
And Union evermore;
From all the earth thy pilgrims came 
And to thy glory bow,
The diadem ol! human hopes 
Endazzling thy fair UTOw-
Columbia, with sword of peace,
One battle yet remains,
Awake and drive the god of war 
From off the ocean plains;
Let anguish cry no more to Heaven 
And countless millions moan, 
Awake, Columbia ,awake,
And flaming Mars dethrone!
The glory of all nations rests 
On peace and on good will,
The mighty Brotherhood of Man 
Is earth’s great power still;
Shine, sacred orb and flame of love, 
Till Old Night, backward hurled, 
Sees man befriend his fellow man 
And Justice rule the world!
JOHN F. PIOWARD, 
Silver Lake Assembly, N. Y.

All ball to great Washington, hero

TO ARMS!
(Tune: Bonnie Doon.)
To arms, Columbia, nor let 
One drop of patriot blood grow pale, 
Meet like with like till from the earth 
And sea shall die war’s final wail! 
Thy ancient traits, Oh, ne’er forget 
While Bunker Hill's, great shaft shall 
rise,
And Revolutions lift mankind 
Up sloping darkness to the skies!
To arms, Columbia, to arms!
Save all that’s dear from flaming Mars, 
Spare Earth’s young manhood to fulfill 
Fond dreams beneath the solemn 
stars;
Make this outrageous war so vast 
No tyrant from it shall emerge,
The Ages call! Columbia, heed, / 
Stay not at peace to sing thy dirge! 
Thou- lovest peace, but Peace herself 
Is buffeted by ruffian wars,
Tis thine to Interpose or else 
Yield up the glory of thy stars!
Oh, wrest her beauty from vile 
hands—
’Tis she that now imploreth thee— 
And for her future Is our cry:
To arms, to arms, Columbia!

who sang in a most pleasing manner, 
"The Sunshine of Your Smile," 
“Nothin’ but Love,” and "Annie

An unusual treat was afforded by 
the presence of C. C. Price, a former 
Chief Electrician of the U. S. Navy. 
Mr. Price explained the opportunities 
for men in the Navy, described life on 
board a battleship and in a submarine 
and related a number of incidents of

MR. SAUDECK LECTURES 
ON THE WOOD WIND CHOIR
On Wednesday morning at eleven 
o’clock Mr, Victor Saudeck of the 
Department of Music gnv6 a most In­
teresting Illustrative lecture on that 
pari of the grand orchestra known 
as the wood wind choir, in which he 
explained I ho use of t hese various 
instruinonts and, assisted by mem­
bers of the Saudeck Ensemble, illus­
trated l ho peculiar tinvbro of their 
voices by characteristic passages 
from some of the world’s most fa­
mous compositions.
Being especially devoted to the 
(In to himself, ho Illustrated with 
Gluck’s “Dance of tho Blessod Spir 
its" and excerpts from DoBussy’s 
"Afternoon of a Faun." This was 
followed by the other instruments. 
The piccolo, which Is tisod with such 
startling effect in Wagner’s "Val­
kyries" lo represent tho wind whist­
ling through I ho clouds, also to ex­
press merriment in carnival scenes, 
etc. The oboe, so pastoral in char­
acter, so difficult to play. The clar­
inet, so valuable because of its great 
range of different tone qualities. The 
bassoon, with its deep rich voice, so 
very Important, as it is the bass of 
the wood-wiiul choir. The contra- 
bassoon, used to reinforce the har­
mony. The English horn, 'the alto of 
the oboe, melancholy breathing in its 
voice, is used with peculiar effect by 
Wagner in “The Flying Dutchman.” 
With these is classed the French 
horn (with its inexpressibly lovely 
voice), for the reason that it blends 
so well with the voices of this choir.
Mr. Saudeclc’s talk was informal, 
instructive and more interesting than 
these sort of lectures are apt to be, 
as there was an entire absence of 
technicalities and stress was laid on 
the peculiar beauty of the several 
voices—their artistic value in ensem­
ble work. Other lectures on similar 
lines would be useful and welcome.
DECORATION STUDENTS 
WIN SEVERAL PRIZES
with valuable criticisms.
Many of the Plebes, or first year 
students, in the Decorating Class made 
such exceptionally good designs for 
drapery silks, that the drawings were 
sent to the largest silk manufacturers 
in the United States by Mr. De Quelin, 
Professor of Decoration. Word has 
been received that several of them 
are to be purchased by the company 
owing to the unusual designs and col­
orings.
M.M.C. S. ALUMNAE HOLD 
MEETING SATURDAY
The M. M. C. S. Alumnae Associa­
tion held its regular meeting last Sat­
urday, Miss Katherine McDermott 
presiding.
The principal subject that was up 
for discussion was the appeal of Miss 
McMullen for assistance in her relief 
work in China.
Miss Jennie L.v Bailey, student in 
Docoration under Professor do Quelin, 
gained a prize of $25.00 In a decorative 
panel competition open to all students, 
which was given by Mrs. Harry Payne 
Whitney, of New York City. Miss 
Bailey has made groat strides in the 
advance of her decorativo work this 
term. She expects to be able to All a 
position with some prominent decor­
ating firm during tho vacation months 
to further her knowledge in actual 
practical experience.
Another student in the Decorating 
Department, Miss Frances Kepler, re­
ceived honorable mention for her 
problem in decoration issued by the 
Beaux Art of New York City. Her 
work attracted sufficient notice from 
the officers to warrant a personal note 
of encouragement and commendation,
