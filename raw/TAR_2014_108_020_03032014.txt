TEDxCMU held its an-
nual conference at Carnegie 
Mellon University, where 11 
speakers gave 10–15 minute 
presentations on a variety 
of topics. Junior decision 
science major Nadyli Nuñez 
serves as president of TEDx-
CMU and was in charge 
of this year’s conference. 
“TEDxCMU is an indepen-
dently organized event,” 
Nuñez said. “TED created 
TEDx to make an amazing 
impact for people. We offer 
TED talks here for free, and 
we are into the free sharing 
of knowledge.”
When asked about the 
speakers at this year’s con-
ference, Nuñez said, “We 
bring in speakers from dif-
ferent ?elds, and this year 
we were looking at some 
of the local talent.” Faculty 
members, students, alumni, 
and individuals from Pitts-
burgh were among those 
who spoke.
Nuñez is in her third year 
with TEDxCMU — which 
is itself in its sixth year at 
Carnegie Mellon. She began 
preparing for the 2014 con-
ference in April 2013. “It’s 
been a journey for our team, 
as well, and it’s been amaz-
ing and inspiring,” she said.
Thirteen people at 
Carnegie Mellon, both un-
dergraduate and graduate 
students, were responsible 
for organizing the event. 
According to the TEDxCMU 
website, these students 
were placed into design, 
logistics, ?nance, publicity, 
and speaker teams. 
Together, the different 
teams combined their ef-
forts to plan and set up the 
event. “I’ve been lucky to be 
with an amazing team,” Nu-
ñez said.
Students interested in 
attending were asked to 
register online, and tickets 
were given on a ?rst-come, 
?rst-serve basis. The event’s 
planning required much 
effort, and the organizers 
made tweaks based on their 
experience from previous 
years. 
“We’re trying to go 
greener,” Nuñez explained, 
noting that the organizers 
this year decided to move 
away from having physi-
cal programs and, instead, 
embrace the digital world. 
They used eventbrite.com, 
a website for organizing 
and promoting events, for 
this year’s talk. The speak-
ers were not ?nancially 
incentivized to present at 
Carnegie Mellon, Nuñez 
said. “We’ve ?own different 
people in. We raise money 
for that, and these speakers 
are doing it for free.” There 
were multiple rehearsals 
before the event took place.

“Go forth and suck.”
It’s not the type of advice 
that Carnegie Mellon students 
are accustomed to hearing, 
but that was Alexis Ohanian’s 
message to attendees of his 
presentation in McConomy 
Auditorium last Tuesday eve-
ning. Ohanian, a co-founder 
of the popular social news 
website Reddit, serial entre-
preneur, and Internet activist, 
stopped at Carnegie Mellon on 
his tour to promote his book 
Without Their Permission: How 
the 21st Century Will Be Made, 
Not Managed, which was pub-
lished last October.
Like the book, his presen-
tation outlined his personal 
history, such as applying to 
Boston startup incubator Y 
Combinator with his Univer-
sity of Virginia roommate and 
Reddit co-founder Steve Huff-
man. 
With meme-?lled slides re-
lated to his experiences, Oha-
nian passed along advice to 
the sparsely populated audi-
torium about the importance 
of having the entrepreneurial 
mindset.
“I want them to get started 
building stuff and doing stuff 
and they don’t have to wait 
to graduate to do that,” Oha-
nian said of the students who 
attend his talks in a special 
interview with The Tartan. 
“Those are the things — hav-
ing ideas and doing them — 
that’s what entrepreneurship 
comes down to.”
Rejection and failure were 
important themes of Oha-
nian’s talk. He told the crowd 
the story of his ?rst business 
idea with Huffman, the idea 
with which they applied to 
Y Combinator. They called it 
My Mobile Menu, an SMS-
based system to order food 
on-the-go. However, while the 
incubator liked the potential 
behind Huffman and Ohanian 
as a team, their initial idea for 
My Mobile Menu was rejected.
It was with that initial fail-
ure that Ohanian encouraged 
students and people within 
the crowd to “go forth and 
suck.”
“We’re all ?guring things 
out, every one of us, and this 
should not stop you,” Ohanian 
said.

Jared L. Cohon, who 
stepped down as the univer-
sity’s eighth president this 
summer, has now accepted 
a new position as director of 
the Wilton E. Scott Institute 
for Energy Innovation at 
Carnegie Mellon.
“He did great things for 
the university [as presi-
dent],” said Rohan Saigal, 
a junior electrical and com-
puter engineering major. “I 
have no doubt that as the 
new director of the Scott 
Institute, he will make us 
proud.”
For a president emeritus 
who has received interna-
tional recognition as both 
a scholar and a leader, stay-
ing at the university was far 
from certain. 
Often, businesses or 
governmental organization 
lure past presidents to posts 
outside of academia.

versity’s seventh president, 
Robert Mehrabian, left the

Venture capitalist Swartz donates $10 million to CMU
BRENT HEARD
Contributing Editor
Renowned venture capital-
ist, entrepreneur, and Carn-
egie Mellon alumnus James 
Swartz (MSIA ’66) has made 
a $10 million donation to the 
Tepper School of Business.
According to a university 
press release, the donation 
by Swartz and his wife Susan 
Swartz aims to support “busi-
ness education, cutting-edge 
research, learning technolo-
gies and interdisciplinary col-
laboration.” The university’s 
press release also included 
that the donation “will be 
used for the construction of a 
295,000 square-foot facility 
in the Tepper Quad that will 
house a number of strategi-
cally interconnected entities, 
including the university’s 
Tepper School of Business, 
the Center for Innovation and 
Entrepreneurship, the Simon 
Initiative and quality of life 
enhancements for the entire 
CMU community.”
Dean of Student Affairs 
Gina Casalegno emailed The 
Tartan, “Mr. and Mrs. Swartz’s 
generous gift to support the 
new Tepper quad is a power-
ful statement about Carnegie 
Mellon’s impact on our alumni 
and their desire to give back 
to the university. Whether 
through the contribution of 
time as a mentor to students, 
continued ?nancial support, 
or helping to shape the vision 
of Carnegie Mellon’s future, 
alumni engagement like Mr. 
Swartz’s is to be admired and 
celebrated.”

New housing to open on Clyde Street
BRENT HEARD
Contributing Editor
This fall, Carnegie Mellon 
upperclassmen will have a 
new option for housing: Clyde 
House.
Director of Housing Servic-
es Tom Cooley has con?rmed 
the new housing location, 
stating that the residence will 
be a “Global Living Learn-
ing Community” in a reno-
vated building located diago-
nally across from Shady Oak 
apartments at 624 Clyde St. 
The building will have three 
?oors, with a possible lower 
level, and will house 28-34 ef-
?ciency apartments.
There will be ?ve com-
munity spaces located in 
the building: one dedicated 
study lounge, three common 
areas, and one kitchen with 
an island-style counter in the 
center.
The application for living 
in Clyde House describes the 
building as “an apartment 
style residential community 
for students with a global cu-
riosity, who are committed to 
deepening their own intercul-
tural competency, and who 
have an interest in develop-
ing a mutual understanding 
of their responsibilities to be 
active global citizens seeking 
to bring change to the world 
they can in?uence.”
Apartments will house two 
to three people in a style simi-
lar to that of the Residence on 
Fifth. The building is sched-
uled to be fully renovated by 
Aug. 1, and the application to 
apply to live in Clyde House is 
separate from normal hous-
ing selection. The application 
is currently live at http://bit.

Carnegie Mellon’s 2014 
International Film Festi-
val, with its theme “Faces 
of Work,” will come to mul-
tiple Pittsburgh locations 
from Mar. 20 through Apr. 5. 
The festival will present 12 
award-winning ?lms, with 
ties to about 20 different 
countries, and will highlight 
the trials and accomplish-
ments of various groups 
of workers throughout the 
world. This concentration 
was an area of focus for Paul 
Goodman, the late ?lm-
maker and professor of or-
ganizational psychology and 
theory at the Tepper School 
of Busines.
At each ?lm’s screening, 
someone connected to the 
?lm, usually the director, 
will be in attendance. There 
will be panel discussions, 
talks, and culinary showings 
related to each ?lm’s themes.
Countries that will be 
represented include Poland, 
India, Israel, China, and the 
United States, among oth-
ers. “Lech Walesa: Man of 
Hope,” is a 2013 Polish ?lm 
biopic about Nobel Peace 
Prize recipient and Polish 
leader Lech Walesa’s contri-
butions to the fall of com-
munism. Walesa’s wife and 
former First Lady of Poland 
Danuta Walesa will be in 
attendance, where she will 
discuss the ?lm’s depiction 
of herself and the events oc-
curring in Poland during the 
time period.
Goodman’s ?nal ?lm, 
“Shipbreakers,” will be 
shown on Friday, Mar. 21 
in McConomy Auditorium. 
Director of media develop-
ment in communications 
design Ralph Vituccio and 
Tom Clancey, a cinematog-
rapher who has worked on 
well-known ?lms including 
“Fast & Furious,” completed 
the ?lm after Goodman’s 
passing.
Tickets on opening night, 
Mar. 20, are $15 for general 
admission and $10 for se-
niors and students. For all 
other nights, tickets are $8 
and $5, respectively. A fes-
tival pass may also be pur-
chased for $50 and $25, re-
spectively.
Student Senate approved 
Peter Masters, a junior with a 
student-de?ned major in en-
ergy policy and an additional 
major in environmental poli-
cy, as a new member-at-large.
Student Senate also dis-
cussed the proposed Arts Pass 
Program resolution from the 
previous meeting. After dis-
cussing possible plans for the 
long-term sustainability of 
the Arts Pass Program, Sen-
ate voted to table the discus-
sion to this week’s Executive 
Committee meeting, where 
Student Body Vice President 
of Finance and junior statis-
tics major Jalen Poteat will be 
present.

“At Carnegie Mellon I 
learned to master manage-
ment science, constructing 
business models to solve chal-
lenges that were completely 
new to the marketplace and 
unleashing the power of data 
for smarter business deci-
sions,” Swartz said in a uni-
versity press release, adding 
that “those lessons, and the 
skills that I developed as a 
result of them, have greatly 
bene?ted me throughout my 
entrepreneurial career. I rec-
ognize the university’s new vi-
sion for the future of business 
education and entrepreneur-
ship and I am pleased to con-
tribute toward their efforts to 
the bene?t of new technolo-
gies and future generations of 
students.”
“Wow, that’s a whole lot of 
money that Tepper’s getting,” 
sophomore computer science 
and robotics double major 
Gillian Rosen said. “I’m glad 
that they’re giving us money. 
More money means more cool 
things that we can do.”
First-year design major 
Linna Grif?n had a more 
mixed reaction. “It seems to 
me that there’s a lot that could 
go well with this money. I 
think it’s genuinely a great 
opportunity to send money to 
increase, not the class sizes, 
of course, but increase the 
depth and breadth of classes 
and increase the utilities that 
students can use in order to 
educate themselves hands-
on,” she said. “I have yet to 
have any notice as to how ex-
actly this money will be used 
and I think, coming down to 
the wire, it’ll really depend on 
how it’s used rather than the 
money itself being present at 
the university.”
University President Subra 
Suresh stated in his campus-
wide email that Swartz is 
dedicated to the success of 
the recently announced Tep-
per Quadrangle on campus. 
Suresh described Swartz as 
a “longstanding adviser to, 
and supporter of, the Tepper 
School and Carnegie Mel-
lon. He has been especially 
engaged as a leader and an 
inspiration in advancing the 
university’s efforts in entre-
preneurship and innovation, 
which is a planned area of fo-
cus for the new Tepper Quad.”
Dean of the Tepper School 
of Business Robert M. Dam-
mon said in the press release 
that Swartz “is a pioneer in 
the world of entrepreneur-
ship, creating order out of 
chaos, allowing new technol-
ogies to develop and ?ourish 
in the marketplace. The new 
home for our business school 
will enable an expansion of 
entrepreneurship across the 
university campus and will 
allow us to expand the pos-
sibilities for innovative re-
search and interdisciplinary 
degrees and provide a ?exible 
technological framework that 
anticipates the needs of next-
generation learning.”

DONATION, from A1
Scott Institute gains new leader
former president of Georgia 
Institute of Technology, G. 
Wayne Clough, became the 
secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institute in Washington D.C.
Many students and faculty 
view Cohon’s decision to lead 
the Scott Institute as a testa-
ment to his belief in the Uni-
versity and the importance of 
energy innovation research.
“This is a big deal,” said 
Constantine Samaras, an as-
sistant professor of civil and 
environmental engineering. 
“Having a former university 
president leading our energy 
initiative demonstrates just 
how serious Carnegie Mellon 
is about this issue.”
Cohon sees energy chal-
lenges as one of the most se-
rious obstacles facing society. 
“In the future, we will have to 
depend less on fossil fuels — 
but the transition will be long 
and dif?cult,” said Cohon in 
an interview. “I believe that 
Carnegie Mellon’s strengths, 
particularly in the technology 
policy interface, will help ad-
dress these challenges.”
Energy has become such 
an important issue that uni-
versities across the United 
States are investing in it. 
Stanford University began 
the Global Climate and En-
ergy Project in 2002, which 
has funded $176 million of 
research. The Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology 
launched the Energy Initia-
tive in 2006, which attracted 
$340 million dollars in its ?rst 
?ve years.
When asked if Carnegie 
Mellon could lead in energy 
research given the level of ?-
nancial support at peer insti-
tutions, Samaras said, “Carn-
egie Mellon is already a leader 
in analyzing the systems-level 
technical, economic and poli-
cy challenges surrounding en-
ergy. The Scott Institute will 
bring together expertise from 
across the university to cata-
lyze new opportunities.”
Western Pennsylvania 
has a long history of energy 
innovation. The coke ov-
ens around Pittsburgh were 
the ?rst in America to adopt 
the beehive style, a technol-
ogy which powered the steel 
boom in the 19th century. 
Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse 
Electric Corporation built the 
?rst commercial nuclear reac-
tor in 1937 and recently, Pitts-
burgh has been the center of 
the gas boom from the Mar-
cellus Shale Formation. 
Not surprisingly, between 
the University of Pittsburgh, 
the Department of Energy’s 
National Energy Technol-
ogy Laboratory, and Carn-
egie Mellon, there has been 
signi?cant energy research 
in the Pittsburgh area. Carn-
egie Mellon has a history of 
bringing together interdisci-
plinary teams to solve energy 
problems. Perhaps the best 
example is Aquion Energy, a 
startup company that sprung 
from Carnegie Mellon. 
Aquion Energy is com-
mercializing an Aqueous Hy-
brid Ion Battery developed 
by Jay Whitacre, a profes-
sor with joint appointments 
in engineering and public 
policy and materials science 
and engineering. These low 
cost, high capacity batteries 
might store energy cheaply 
enough to make unreliable re-
newable energy sources, like 
wind or solar power, more 
cost effective.
The Scott Institute, which 
will ultimately be housed in 
the new Scott Hall, is set to 
encourage more interdisci-
plinary projects like Aquion, 
and will attract new funding 
sources to help realize these 
projects. “The institute’s 
objective,” said M. Morgan 
Granger, the current direc-
tor of the Scott Institute, and 
Lord Professor and head of 
engineering and public policy, 
“is to raise Carnegie Mellon’s 
already great level of activ-
ity in energy-related research 
and education to an even 
higher level.” 
Since its inception in Sep-
tember 2012, the Institute has 
raised more than $50 million 
for energy research. Cohon 
has a signi?cant background 
in energy resource. He has 
written extensively on energy 
policy and has a track record 
of raising money for energy 
related research. 
Under Cohon’s leadership, 
Carnegie Mellon received a 
signi?cant gift from Lowell 
and Jan Steinbrenner for the 
Steinbrenner Institute for En-
vironmental Education and 
Research, as well as gifts from 
Sherman and Joyce Bowie 
Scott and the Richard King 
Mellon Foundation for the 
Scott Institute.

Reddit cofounder visits CMU
After My Mobile Menu was 
denied, Huffman and Oha-
nian went back to the draw-
ing board, and enrolled in Y 
Combinator’s ?rst class with 
the idea for Reddit.
“We hadn’t built anything 
yet, but I already had a t-shirt 
with our mascot on it, which 
I do not recommend — that 
is the wrong order of opera-
tions,” Ohanian said to the 
audience.
According to the web ana-
lytics company Alexa, Reddit 
is now the 64th most popular 
website in the world in terms 
of average daily visitors and 
page views — the 24th most 
popular in terms of visitors 
from the United States.
At each of the school vis-
its on the book tour, Ohanian 
invited an alumnus from that 
school who started a compa-
ny or similar venture to talk 
about his or her experience. 
At this talk, founder and CEO 
of Comprehend Systems Rick 
Morrison (SCS ’03) sat down 
with Ohanian to talk about his 
time at Carnegie Mellon.
Comprehend offers medi-
cal data aggregation and 
analysis services for various 
clients in the health industry. 
Morrison started Compre-
hend Systems after a string 
of starting companies and 
business ideas with varying 
success.
“I had a series of failed 
startups and failed attempts 
along the way,” Morrison 
said. “And it’s really what 
[Ohanian] said about taking 
risks and putting things out 
there and standing by them.”
Carnegie Mellon has made 
efforts recently to encourage 
entrepreneurship in students 
and faculty. 
The recently-announced 
Tepper Quadrangle, to be 
built in the current Morewood 
parking lot, will be home to 
the Center for Innovation and 
Entrepreneurship. 
The center, which was 
founded in 2012, was itself 
based on the partnership be-
tween the Donald H. Jones 
Center for Entrepreneurship 
and Project Olympus, both of 
which foster student entre-
preneurship at Carnegie Mel-
lon and act as incubators for 
new potential businesses.
Additionally, startups at 
the university have been sup-
ported by the Open Field 
Entrepreneurs Fund, a fund 
started by Flip Video creator 
and Carnegie Mellon alum-
nus Jonathan Kaplan (TSB 
‘90), for graduating entre-
preneurs that was announced 
at the 2011 Commencement 
Ceremony.
When asked about what 
people should take away from 
the talk, Ohanian said, “Not 
everyone is going to end up 
being a founder of a company, 
but the skill of being entrepre-
neurial, having ideas and go-
ing through with them — that 
skill is so important.”

TEDxCMU brings a varied array of speakers to campus
of Ceremonies. According to 
Janssen, “I’m a business mi-
nor in addition to music, and 
one of the required courses is 
marketing. In that class, a few 
seats away from me was Na-
dyli Nuñez, and after the ?rst 
couple weeks, she came up to 
me, and she wrote to me in 
an email a couple days later.” 
Nuñez invited him to audition 
for the position of Master of 
Ceremonies.
“I was of course very much 
?attered, and I was aware of 
TED talks and the TEDxCMU 
conference,” Janssen said. 
“However, I hadn’t really done 
much of this kind of work. But 
I had a recital back in February 
of last year, in which I was my 
own Master of Ceremonies, 
so I had a little bit of expe-
rience that was enough for 
them to credit my ability, so I 
auditioned, and a couple days 
later they emailed me and said 
they’d like for me to be the 
Master of Ceremonies.”
“Like the parts of a ma-
chine, everyone has their own 
duty,” Janssen said. “And in 
true teamwork fashion, we are 
working for a higher purpose. 
I found our speakers this year 
to be very exciting, and it was 
a new challenge, something I 
hadn’t done before. I’ve spent 
my life as a performer, but 
usually with [an] instrument 
in hand. I’ve never really had 
the opportunity to have my 
voice as an instrument.”
“There are eight speak-
ers, two performers and two 
videos,” Janssen said of the 
event. “[We have] Matthew 
Gray, who is a stage director 
who prides himself in collabo-
rations with other disciplines. 
We have Richard Pell, who 
opened a Center for PostNatu-
ral History.... We have Nina 
Barbuto, who founded As-
semble, which is a space for 
creativity through different 
projects. We have Dan Boyar-
ski, who was a professor in the 
design department here, and 
he’ll be talking about kinetic 
typography.”
Meredith Grelli, who 
co-founded Wigle Whiskey 
with her family, also spoke at 
TEDxCMU. Grelli’s is the ?rst 
whiskey distillery in Pitts-
burgh since the prohibition 
era. Lorrie Faith Cranor, di-
rector of the Carnegie Mellon 
CyLab Usable Privacy and Se-
curity Laboratory, gave a TED 
talk about Internet security. 
Founder of OpenCurriculum 
Varun Arora also spoke. Op-
enCurriculum is a free online 
database of curated teaching 
materials and curricula. Scott 
Andrew and Nina Sarnelle 
performed on behalf of the 
Institute of New Feeling — a 
research clinic experimenting 
in news ways of feeling physi-
cally and emotionally — to 
demonstrate some of the tech-
niques they use there. Mallory 
Wang, a junior information 
systems major, demonstrated 
her Chinese yo-yo skills. 
One of the speakers, Jane 
Werner, talked about sew-
ing and its relation to her 
Makeshop program at the 
Children’s Museum of Pitts-
burgh, in which “children and 
families can design, create, 
and play freely using their 
own imaginations.” Werner 
has also developed Makeshop 
Plus, which is geared toward 
“older children who are still 
exploring their childhood pas-
sions.”
Werner said that the reason 
she is a children’s museum di-
rector is because she used to 
sew. The process of sewing, 
in which changes, rips, and 
improvisation are often em-
ployed, is similar to life, she 
explained. “Sewing taught me 
a whole bunch about materi-
als, and [Makeshop] is teach-
ing these kids also to see their 
world in a new way,” Werner 
said. “It gave me con?dence 
[and] perseverance, and you 
can see how proud people are 
of their works. It’s important 
that we give kids and families 
this opportunity to work to-
gether and discover who they 
are.”
Dan Boyarski, professor 
and former head of the School 
of Design, talked about kinetic 
typography and how it facili-
tates communication. He com-
pared the book culture of the 
past to digital culture and ex-
plained how the current digi-
tal culture has more to offer. 
While books are static, digital 
mediums are more dynamic. 
Digital culture, he argued, can 
be more effective in conveying 
a message than books.
The diversity of presenta-
tions appealed to students 
who attended. Baek Kim, a 
sophomore electrical and 
computer engineering and 
robotics double major, said, 
“I liked the presentation on 
kinetic typography and the 
?rst presentation, because 
I thought it was interesting 
how [Gray] connected Shake-
speare to binary.”
“I just declared my robot-
ics major, and I liked how he 
connected his speech to some-
thing I can relate to. I liked 
all of the presentations,” Kim 
said.

Astrobotic quali?es for Milestone Prize from Lunar XPRIZE
ROHAN VARMA
Assistant SciTech Editor
From 1955 to 1972, the 
governments of the Soviet 
Union and the United States 
captivated the world and in-
spired a generation. From the 
Russians launching Sputnik 1 
on Oct. 4, 1957, to the United 
States landing Apollo 11 and 
the ?rst humans on the moon 
on July 20, 1969, the limits of 
human exploration and sci-
enti?c accomplishment were 
pushed to bounds never before 
seen.
Now, NASA has slowly 
crumbled due to budget cuts 
and, unfortunately, space ex-
ploration has lost its former 
buzz. The governments of the 
United States and Russia have 
stepped down from the po-
dium, setting the stage for the 
next pioneer of the universe: 
the private sector.
Companies like Google 
and SpaceX have incentivized 
some of the brightest minds in 
the world to tackle the chal-
lenge of space exploration 
in part by offering prizes for 
reaching milestones. Google’s 
Lunar XPRIZE is the latest 
competition, with almost 20 
private companies entered. 
This prize awards over $30 
million in winnings to com-
panies able to achieve speci?c 
goals pertaining to lunar ex-
ploration. The grand prize is 
$20 million to the ?rst team 
that can successfully land a 
rover on the moon and navi-
gate 500 meters with it.
However, before the ?-
nal countdown to the moon 
begins, Google will award 
$1.75 million in Milestone 
Prizes to companies that can 
demonstrate technical goals 
in landing, mobility, and 
imaging. Last week, two of the 
19 teams entered in the com-
petition were announced to 
qualify to potentially receive 
awards in all three catego-
ries. One of them is Carnegie 
Mellon’s spinoff company: 
Astrobotic Technology Inc. 
 
The Team
Astrobotic, a Pittsburgh-
based company run by John 
Thorton, has a 12-man team, 
some of whom are Carnegie 
Mellon students and faculty. 
Headed by Red Whittaker — 
Fredkin University research 
professor of the Robotics Insti-
tute and director of the Field 
Robotics Center — they lead 
the work on the lunar rover 
and provide signi?cant contri-
butions to the mission.
Speaking about the vision 
Astrobotic follows, Thornton 
said, “A big part of our mission 
is democratizing space and the 
moon. It is about creating the 
moon as the next continent to 
the world. It is about bringing 
the moon closer to all of us. We 
need to learn to live off of this 
planet. We need to identify 
where the resources are and 
harvest them. We need to cre-
ate an off-Earth economy and 
start to spread into space.”
Carnegie Mellon’s goals 
are also as spectacular in na-
ture. “Carnegie Mellon never 
does anything just for a prize,” 
Whittaker said. “There is al-
ways a higher purpose. It will 
be to build a future of space 
robotics. All technological 
challenges are the same in 
that way. There was a time 
when the world didn’t be-
lieve a computer could defeat 
a human chess champion, 
and so Carnegie Mellon went 
after that. Space is the next 
destination and it is a substan-
tial technological challenge. 
Whether you look at computer 
chess playing, ?ying in the 
early days, driver-less racing, 
or moon exploration, there 
is nothing easy about it. You 
don’t do these things because 
they are easy.”
Since the beginning of 
space exploration, there have 
only ever been two robots 
that have traversed the lands 
on the moon; one of them 
came from China and the 
other came from the Soviet 
Union. However, these mis-
sions were both carried out 
with extensive amounts of re-
sources and time. Illustrating 
the monumental accomplish-
ment Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents and faculty are chasing, 
Whittaker said, “The Soviets 
and China each put more than 
a decade into [their missions]. 
If you count the people that 
touched it, there were hun-
dreds of thousands. Moreover, 
the money is in the billions. 
You have to think, by compari-
son, very highly of this com-
munity [at Carnegie Mellon] 
that doesn’t have that decade 
and doesn’t have those billions 
and doesn’t have that army of 
hundreds of thousands getting 
it done.”
The majority of the work 
on the rover is done by Carn-
egie Mellon students enrolled 
in the course 16-865, Ad-
vanced Mobile Robot Devel-
opment. While this class only 
meets of?cially once a week, 
the members of the team in-
vest hundreds of hours each 
month into perfecting the de-
sign and building the rover to 
ensure that everything will go 
smoothly for when the launch 
day comes. During the class, 
Whittaker stressed the neces-
sity of attention to detail when 
he said, “Imagine if you had 
only one shot in all of eter-
nity to get your dream done. 
You can’t leave anything for 
granted.”
While many people on 
the team are upperclassman 
and graduate students with 
years of experience, there are 
also many younger members 
learning on the job. Jake Tes-
ler, a ?rst-year electrical and 
computer engineering major, 
joined the course last semester 
with little to no experience in 
robotics. However, with work 
and guidance, Tesler is now 
making contributions to the 
avionics that go behind the 
rover. 
The Mission
Whittaker maintained that 
while $20 million cashed into 
the bank would be gratifying, 
the true excitement lies in 
the exploration of the moon. 
Whittaker said, “It is authen-
tic exploration. XPRIZE pays 
you for driving around in the 
dirt anywhere you want to go. 
However, that’s not enough 
for us. We go for the discovery, 
for the science and for the ex-
ploration.”
“There are very real moti-
vations,” he continued. “One 
of the reasons the moon is our 
destination is because of the 
exploration of the pits. These 
pits are holes which collapsed 
in. The things that are new 
on the moon are the water, 
the ice, and the pits. For de-
cades exploration has looked 
at rocks, dust, and gravity, but 
has missed all together the 
great prize [the pits]. The pit 
of interest is the size of Heinz 
Field and as tall as the Statue 
of Liberty. Many hypotheses 
for life on extraterrestrial bod-
ies suggest that would likely 
exist underground. Addi-
tionally, one of the collapsed 
walls has a ramp and so there 
are some wild scenarios, of 
course, for what could explain 
this.”
The current goal for the 
team commanding the mis-
sion is to land the rover on the 
moon, drive it 500 meters to 
collect the XPRIZE, and then 
begin exploration and exami-
nation of the pit. 
This is a scienti?c dis-
covery that has never been 
accomplished.
The last generation was 
able to ?nd pride, joy, and in-
spiration in NASA’s mission to 
land on the moon. 
While NASA may no longer 
be the force that it once was, 
Astrobotic could be the hero of 
this generation. 
Employees, students, and 
faculty at Carnegie Mellon 
and Astrobotic are working 
to accomplish a potentially 
game-changing goal that 
could inspire generations to 
come, and prove that not only 
is there so much left to accom-
plish, but also that if you reach 
high enough for huge dreams, 
you can grab them.
Sitti develops gecko feet-inspired adhesive
RAGHUNANDAN AVULA
Staffwriter
Geckos are the closet thing 
to a real life Spiderman — 
they can climb up walls and 
run across ceilings with ex-
treme agility and quickness. 
Carnegie Mellon’s Metin 
Sitti, head of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s NanoRobotics Laborato-
ry and professor of mechani-
cal engineering, with courtesy 
appointments in biomedical 
engineering, electrical and 
computer engineering, and 
the Robotics Institute, has 
been working with his re-
search teams on developing 
adhesive material that mimics 
the stickiness of geckos’ feet 
for the past decade. 
Besides having adhesive 
feet, geckos also have the 
amazing ability to clear their 
feet of dust by walking on a 
clean surface. Similarly, Sitti 
and his team showed in their 
recent publication on Feb. 
19 in the Interface Journal of 
the British Royal Society how 
their previously developed 
adhesive material can be 
cleaned using a similar tech-
nique, allowing their tape to 
be reusable.
Over 12 years ago, when 
Sitti was completing his post-
doctoral research at the Uni-
versity of California, Berkley, 
he was approached by the 
Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA) to 
work on developing climbing 
robots. In 2000, Keller Au-
tumn, a professor of biology 
at Lewis & Clark College, pub-
lished in Nature his research 
explaining how gecko feet 
were a smart adhesive that 
were controlled mechanically 
and not chemically. Sitti’s 
specialty is small robots, but 
when he came to Carnegie 
Mellon, his project translated 
into developing an adhesive 
that mimics gecko feet.
Sitti described the proj-
ect as “mimicking nature 
in mechanics” by “replicat-
ing nature using synthetic 
materials.”
He explained that between 
2006 and 2009, he and his 
team had a number of publi-
cations explaining their suc-
cess in developing a tape-like 
adhesive “that could stick 
to surfaces with no chemi-
cal additives, purely based 
on mechanical design similar 
to gecko feet.” In 2009, Sitti 
commercialized their product 
through a Carnegie Mellon 
spinoff company called nano-
Griptech to incorporate their 
adhesive technology into a 
wide variety of applications.
Similar to how geckos have 
patches of hair on their feet 
and folds that contribute to 
their stickiness, the adhesive 
that Sitti and his team created 
was mechanically designed to 
have ?bers with mushroom-
tipped structures at the end 
that act as suction cups. The 
small-scale physics between 
the suction cups and the sur-
face allows the adhesive to 
stick to the surface very well 
with no chemicals involved. 
Currently, the adhesive can 
support up to one kilogram 
per centimeter squared.
Tape, one of the most com-
monly used adhesives, can 
only be used once because it is 
prone to getting dirty. Similar-
ly, gecko feet and the adhesive 
the research team developed 
can also get dirty. Sitti shared 
that they recently “took upon 
the challenge of making their 
product reusable so it would 
be comparable to Velcro.”
Sitti said that their adhe-
sive could be dipped in water, 
which would remove all dirt 
particles. But what if one does 
not have water at hand?
When gecko’s feet get dirty, 
and they ?nd a lessened abil-
ity to stick to surfaces, they 
climb onto a clean surface and 
shed particles. Sitti explained 
that “biologists theorized that 
geckos have patches of hairs, 
but more importantly, gaps 
in between the hairs that dirt 
particles roll in between.” In 
addition, “?ber hair thickness 
was important because par-
ticles smaller than the ?bers 
would be harder to get rid of.”
Based on these guidelines, 
Sitti and his team slightly 
modi?ed their mechanical 
design and showed that their 
adhesive could be cleaned in a 
similar way.
Sitti explained that geckos 
use a load-drag-unload clean-
ing technique where “they 
?rst load their feet onto a sur-
face, drag their feet slightly 
backward generating friction, 
and then release their feet to 
make their next step.” 
The adhesive was ex-
posed to silica beads and, us-
ing this technique, could be 
cleaned and returned to full 
functionality.
He believes that one of the 
great things about the project 
is that this mechanical model 
has actually helped scientists 
con?rm their theory of how 
geckos clean their feet by ex-
amining the technique close 
up on the adhesive.
“This has been a very in-
ternational project,” Sitti said. 
He and his team have collabo-
rated with Hendrik Hoefscher 
and Michael Rohrig of Karl-
sruhe Institute of Technology 
in Germany. Members of the 
Carnegie Mellon team include 
Uyiosa Abusomwan,  Ph.D. 
candidate in mechanical en-
gineering, and Yigit Menguc, 
a former Ph.D. student with 
Sitti and current postdoctoral 
fellow at Harvard University.
Sitti was proud to an-
nounce that Abusomwan was 
awarded ?rst place last week 
at the Adhesion Society’s An-
nual Conference in San Diego 
for best poster. The poster 
highlighted the gecko adhe-
sive’s ability to clean and be 
reused. Sitti humbly believes 
that the credit for the success 
of their work should go to his 
students.
The adhesive has many 
widespread uses, from gloves 
to medical applications in-
volving anything with tempo-
rary adhesion. Sitti shared his 
vision to use it to hang things 
up on walls. With the adhe-
sive’s now reusable feature, an 
indecisive person could move 
a picture around their house 
and try multiple locations.
His team is now exploring 
uses of the adhesive in ro-
botic manipulation, where it 
can be used to pick and place 
complex and fragile parts. 
For example, on an assembly 
line for televisions, parts must 
be carefully picked up and 
placed. Since no chemicals are 
involved, the adhesive would 
not leave any residue on the 
product. The gecko adhesive 
could potentially be attached 
to a balloon, which would 
adjust shape, providing soft-
ness when picking up fragile 
objects.

The ability to quickly fall 
asleep and remain asleep af-
ter a long day is something 
that many people take for 
granted. Sleep disorders, 
however, can disturb this nat-
ural phenomenon and cause 
a variety of unpleasant side 
effects that can hinder an in-
dividual’s ability to properly 
function.
Insomnia, or dif?culty 
falling asleep and staying 
asleep, is a common disorder 
that affects many individuals 
worldwide. According to the 
Sleep Health Foundation, up 
to 10 percent of adults are 
affected by insomnia at any 
given time. Insomnia is in-
?uenced by a variety of fac-
tors, including traits such as 
gender and age; women and 
seniors over age 60 are par-
ticularly susceptible to bouts 
of insomnia. In addition to 
dif?culty falling and stay-
ing asleep, individuals with 
insomnia can experience a 
variety of side effects such 
as fatigue, headaches, and 
anxiety. Lack of sleep can also 
feed into more serious prob-
lems, like depression, and 
can increase risk of stroke or 
diseases, like diabetes.
Insomnia can be split into 
primary and secondary in-
somnia. Primary insomnia 
is not caused by an external 
factor like stress or another 
health problem. Primary in-
somnia is further categorized 
into psychophysiological, 
idiopathic, and paradoxical 
insomnia. Psychophysiologi-
cal insomniacs are individu-
als who worry about falling 
sleep. Their fear of not being 
able to fall asleep ironically 
prevents them from sleeping. 
Idiopathic insomniacs are 
individuals whose insomnia 
developed early in life and 
persists as a lifetime disorder. 
Paradoxical insomniacs are 
insomniacs who are unable 
to sleep, but experience no 
other symptoms of insomnia,   
like fatigue or anxiety.
Secondary insomnia is 
caused by an external factor. 
This could be anything from 
a stressful day at work, a shift 
in schedule, or a health con-
cern such as bipolar disorder. 
According to the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
tute, about 80 percent of peo-
ple who experience insomnia 
have secondary insomnia. 
Secondary insomnia gener-
ally goes away without treat-
ment if the cause is removed.
Insomnia can also be cat-
egorized by the length of 
time it is experienced. Tran-
sient, acute, and chronic are 
the three main classi?cations 
of insomnia based on dura-
tion. Transient insomnia 
lasts for a few days, and is 
generally caused by a speci?c 
event or circumstance, such 
as an upcoming deadline or 
stressful occasion. Acute in-
somnia is also short-term,

LAINE HERRON
Special to The Tartan
You may have heard of Bit-
coin in the last few months, 
as it has shown up in stories 
of illicit drug marketplaces, 
overnight millionaires, and 
massive heists. What are Bit-
coins, and why have they got-
ten people so excited?
Bitcoin ?rst appeared in 
2008 with an academic paper 
published under the pseud-
onym Satoshi Nakamoto. 
The paper described a way in 
which multiple users could 
agree on the contents of a list 
of messages, called the block-
chain. New messages could 
only be added to the block-
chain if the majority of users 
agreed to put them in, and 
no one could take down the 
blockchain unless they could 
take down a majority of the us-
ers. The paper also described 
a way of using the blockchain 
to track the ownership of vir-
tual coins. New coins would 
be assigned to the users who 
maintained the blockchain, 
based on how much work they 
contributed to the effort. Us-
ers could then transfer owner-
ship of their coins to others by 
adding a new message to the 
blockchain stating their de-
sire to do so. They signed the 
message with a special “digi-
tal signature,” showing that 
the message was really from 
them. Once the message was 
added to the blockchain, it 
would be visible to everyone, 
so that all of the users could 
agree on the ownership of the 
coins. Nakamoto published 
an open source program to 
implement these ideas, and 
Bitcoin was born. Since then, 
speculation on Bitcoins has 
been rampant. 
It is not un-
common 
for the 
price of Bitcoins to 
double or halve over a single 
day. As of Mar. 1, 2014, Bit-
coins were selling at $568, 
down from a high of $1,124 
a few months before. Bitcoin 
evokes a question: Why are 
people willing to trade real 
dollars for virtual coins? At 
its core, currency derives 
its value from the expecta-
tions that others will accept 
it in exchange for goods. Even 
though paper dollars are not a 
particularly useful good them-
selves, a social agreement on 
their value arises from the fact 
that it is much easier to trade 
using paper dollars than to 
trade by bartering with actual 
goods, like iPods and bagels.
U.S. dollars have a big 
advantage in that the U.S. 
has promised to accept dol-
lars as payment for ?nes and 
taxes. However, trad-
ing in U.S. dol-
lars also has 
drawbacks, 
especially in 
an electronic and 
global market. There is 
no guarantee that the United 
States will not print more 
money, making dollars less 
valuable, but with Bitcoin 
there are guarantees on the 
number of new Bitcoins cre-
ated. Transferring dollars be-
tween people within the U.S. 
requires meeting in person, 
waiting three to ?ve business 
days on bank transfers, or giv-
ing up three percent of trans-
actions to credit card com-
panies. Transferring money 
between countries becomes 
even more complicated, costly, 
and slow. Bitcoin allows users 
to transfer coins to anywhere 
in the world with almost no 
fees, and to do it within 10 
minutes. It is not surprising 
that many companies — such 
as WordPress, Reddit, and 
OKCupid, according to Nas-
daq — like the idea of using 
Bitcoins over dollars, when 
it means getting their money 
faster and more reliably with-
out shelling out three percent 
to credit card companies. For 
these reasons, many consum-
ers and merchants are willing 
to trade in some dollars for 
Bitcoins, in exchange for hav-
ing these conveniences. Bit-
coins could increase prosper-
ity for everyone by improving 
trade through the smoother 
transfer of money, but is the 
smoother transfer of money 
worth the costs? Bitcoin can 
be used as the online equiva-
lent of cash, allowing users to 
buy illegal goods, avoid taxes, 
and circumvent sanctions 
with anonymity. Bitcoin raises 
the question: What are the re-
percussions of a society where 
all money is anonymous?

advocacy, educational organi-
zation that discusses the impli-
cations of science. This article is

As Henry Wadsworth 
Longfellow once said, “Mu-
sic is the universal language 
of mankind.” This Saturday, 
Mar. 1, 64 musicians from 
across the globe were united 
through a virtual concert that 
was broadcast in Rashid Audi-
torium in the Gates Center.
Roger Dannenberg, profes-
sor of computer science, art, 
and music at Carnegie Mel-
lon, was the “semiconductor” 
of the group, which is called 
the Global Network Orchestra 
and featured musicians from 
North America and Europe, 
as well as from New Zealand, 
Malaysia, Iceland, India, Tur-
key, and Australia. The uni-
versal musicians used their 
laptops to simultaneously 
perform together while Dan-
nenberg conducted the group 
virtually from the Ammerman 
Center at Connecticut College.
Dannenberg emphasized 
in his opening statement that 
the Global Network Orchestra 
embodies the idea that every-
one around the world is con-
nected: “It helps us realize we 
are all brothers and sisters, no 
matter how far away or seem-
ingly different we might be.”
But how could 64 musi-
cians from around the world 
be synced together, especially 
with the amount of precision 
needed to perform in a con-
cert together?
“There are several things 
that all have to work: cross-
platform software, simple user 
interfaces, and low-latency 
robust networking,” Dannen-
berg said in an email. Stream-
ing would be far too inef?-
cient, so Dannenberg and Tom 
Neuendorffer — co-creator of 
the project and a principal en-
gineer at Carnegie Speech, a 
developer of software for as-
sessing and teaching spoken 
language skills — created a 
system which allowed the 
musicians to transmit audio 
information in a way that uses 
much less bandwidth than 
streaming.
Dannenberg explained that 
instead of having each musi-
cian send and receive streams 
of audio, which would take an 
enormous amount of band-
width, the audio generated by 
each musician is decomposed 
into a pitch and a loudness, 
which only takes a few bytes.
“Each player receives the 
pitch and loudness informa-
tion from every other player 
and reconstructs the audio 
with a local synthesizer, sav-
ing the need to transmit or re-
ceive streams of audio,” Dan-
nenberg said. “The synthesis 
is based on samples that are 
shared and downloaded by 
all the performers before the 
concert.”
“Another challenge, which 
is more musical than techni-
cal, is the speed of light. The 
delays impose some limits on 
how well you can synchronize, 
and therefore in?uence what 
kinds of music it makes sense 
to perform,” Dannenberg 
said.The pieces performed are 
as follows: “Prayer for Peace,” 
which was composed by Dan-
nenberg himself; “Grant Us 
Peace,” a Bach chorale from 
BWV 42; “Riffs and Drums,” a 
conducted improvisation led 
by Dannenberg; and ?nally, 
“Dona Nobis Pacem.”
Janelle Burdell, a profes-
sional drummer and percus-
sionist, performed live in the 
Rashid Auditorium as the fea-
tured musician of “Riffs and 
Drums.” Two other renowned 
musicians who performed as 
part of the Global Network 
Orchestra include Pauline Oli-
veros, a well-known American 
composer, and Scot Gresham-
Lancaster, a pioneer of net-
worked and telematics music.
As with all performances, 
the Global Network Orches-
tra faced a few technical 
dif?culties. For example, 
there were supposed to be 
100 musicians total, but due 
to network connection issues, 
only 64 musicians participat-
ed. As Dannenberg joked at 
the end of the performance, 
though, “64 is 100 in base 8!”
While the idea of a virtual 
orchestra is still novel, the 
Global Network Orchestra’s 
performance con?rms that it 
is not only entirely possible, 
but is a concept that may con-
tinue to grow in the future.
Past humans may have spent 10,000 years on ice bridge
Recent genetic and envi-
ronmental evidence suggests 
that early humans may have 
spent around 10,000 years on 
the Bering land bridge before 
moving into the Americas.
Most paleontologists as-
sumed the Bering land bridge 
had been an inhospitable 
tundra steppe and that hu-
mans would not have stayed 
long there. However, drilled 
sediment from under the Ber-
ing sea indicates that the land 
bridge may have had shrubs, 
or even trees. Other evidence 
around this time indicates 
that ice sheets covered much 
of America, thus isolating the 
land bridge. Genetic analysis 
also supports the hypothesis. 
By looking at mitochondrial 
DNA, which is only passed 
down through the mother, 
it was determined that Na-
tive Americans became a ge-
netically distinct population 
around 25,000 years ago but 
did not actually migrate into 
the Americas until around 
15,000 years ago.

U.K. proposes legislation to allow embryo donations
The U.K. government has 
proposed legislation that may 
allow the DNA of a healthy 
donor to be implanted into 
an embryo of two other par-
ents. The procedure would 
allow women who have mi-
tochondrial diseases to have 
healthy children. In the pro-
cedure, the mitochondria in 
the embryo is swapped with 
a healthy donor’s mitochon-
dria; this process causes some 
mitochondrial DNA to also be 
transferred to the embryo.
This form of alteration could 
be passed down through gen-
erations. Currently, U.K. leg-
islature forbids the genetic 
alteration of human eggs or 
embryos. The U.K. has been 
evaluating the medical and 
social issues surrounding the 
procedures since 2011, when 
scientists claimed the tech-
nique was ready for human 
trials.

Eating device may help patients who have hand tremors
A new study released 
by the University of Michi-
gan shows that a hand tool 
can help patients overcome 
tremors and eat normally. 
The study included 15 pa-
tients with moderate-to-
severe tremors and showed 
that the device — developed 
by Anupam Pathak, CEO of 
San Francisco-based startup 
?rm Lift Labs — could stabi-
lize the tremors enough for 
patients to be able to keep a 
spoon and fork stable enough 
to eat. Patients rated the de-
vice’s effectiveness by using 
a standard tremor rating and 
by analyzing digital readings 
of the spoon’s movement. 
The tool utilizes tiny 
sensors that can detect 
movement from all angles 
and then respond with a 
quick countermovement.

Prenatal nicotine exposure shown to lead to ADHD
A new study out of Florida 
State University found evi-
dence that a prenatal expo-
sure to nicotine could affect 
multiple future generations. 
The researchers, professors 
Pradeep G. Bhide and Jinmin 
Zhu, suggest that nicotine ex-
posure can cause epigenetic 
changes — changes that af-
fect parts of one’s DNA, such 
as turning on or off certain 
regions. Prior studies sug-
gested that smoking during 
pregnancy led to a 40 percent 
increase likelihood of Atten-
tion De?cit Hyperactivity Dis-
order (ADHD) cases.
To see if something was 
happening at the genetic 
level, Bhide and Zhu exposed 
pregnant mice to nicotine. 
In their multigenerational 
study, they found that chang-
es occurring in the grand-
parent’s genes were being 
passed on to offspring. How-
ever, many future studies are 
needed before any sort of 
causality between the two is 
determined.

Mysterious polio-like illness found in ?ve children
At least ?ve children in 
California have been suffer-
ing from a virus that causes 
polio-like symptoms, includ-
ing limb paralysis and prob-
lems with breathing. In all of 
these cases, the children did 
not respond to treatments 
and their paralysis appears to 
be permanent. The children 
do not have polio, since they 
were all vaccinated against 
it. Doctors believe that the 
cause of the symptoms may 
be enterovirus-68, which was 
?rst detected in California 
over 50 years ago. Enterovi-
rus-68 has been con?rmed 
in two of the cases. Other 
viruses which are known to 
have paralysis as a symptom 
are West Nile, echoviruses, 
and adenoviruses.
Researchers say that the 
problem is not endemic and 
parents should be aware, but 
not alarmed.

Older paternal age  linked to likelihood of ADHD in kids
A recent study published 
in JAMA Psychiatry has shown 
that children born to fathers 
over the age of 45 are three 
times more likely to develop 
autism and 13 times more 
likely to have Attention De?-
cit Hyperactivity Disorder 
(ADHD) than children born 
to fathers 20–24 years of age. 
The researchers looked at 
millions of parent-child rela-
tionships in Sweden between 
1973 and 2001. They focused 
speci?cally on relationships 
with siblings; using related 
individuals takes out envi-
ronmental factors. Previous 
studies also linked older fa-
thers with increases in sub-
stance abuse and schizophre-
nia among their children.

but it generally lasts for sev-
eral weeks. These short-term 
forms of insomnia are usually 
treated with lifestyle changes. 
Avoiding food, caffeine, and 
exercise before going to sleep; 
keeping your bedroom dark, 
quiet, and cool; as well as hav-
ing a regular sleep schedule 
can help prevent short-term 
insomnia.
Chronic insomnia is long-
term insomnia. According to 
howstuffworks.com, chronic 
insomnia occurs when an in-
dividual is unable to sleep for 
six hours a night at least three 
nights a week over the dura-
tion of 30 days. Treatment 
for chronic insomnia includes 
various techniques in addi-
tion to lifestyle changes. One 
major treatment is cognitive 
behavioral therapy, which at-
tempts to reduce worry and 
anxiety about going to sleep. 
Other treatments involve 
therapy to alter the way the 
individual perceives their 
bed and reduce psychological 
stress associated with sleep. 
In addition to behavioral 
therapy, chronic insomnia 
can also be treated with over-
the-counter or prescription 
medication.
Insomnia, whether moder-
ate or severe, is a signi?cant 
medical condition that can 
have a dramatic impact on 
various aspects of an individ-
ual’s life. As researchers con-
tinue to better understand the 
brain and the way that sleep 
works, new discoveries are 
constantly altering the way 
we understand insomnia and 
improving the methods used 
to treat the disease.

Student wellness worth more than free stuff 
In light of increasing national 
attention to obesity, as well as the 
recent campus and administrative 
response to a “stress culture” at 
Carnegie Mellon, University Health 
Services’ day-long event “Exploring 
Health, Discovering Wellness” on 
Feb. 21 in the University Center was 
a timely move for students to re?ect 
on their own well-being. There were, 
however, a few areas in which the 
event could have improved.
The American Medical Associa-
tion (AMA) proclaimed obesity as 
a disease in August of last year, and 
while not all agree with the designa-
tion, it does lend credence to doctors 
looking to prescribe medication and 
to organizations looking to fundraise 
toward reducing obesity rates in 
America.
 In a country stereotyped as over-
weight — where 27.1 percent of 
adults could be classi?ed as obese — 
these steps are necessary. Regardless 
of the reasoning behind University 
Health Services’ event, any solid at-
tempt at helping young adults stay 
healthy is worthwhile.
A positive aspect of this event 
was the healthy dining additions for 
campus locations. However, these 
options were only offered for the 
day and were not highly advertised. 
Why not make each of these healthy 
options permanent additions? The 
addition of these items permanently 
could have signi?ed an extended 
campaign for campus health.
Housing and Dining Services, 
or even the eateries themselves, 
could have more actively advertised 
if these dishes were only going to 
be available only for the day of the 
event. While undergraduate stu-
dents might not have the chance to 
get these dishes again, they did get 
to practice their healthy cooking if 
they attended the interactive cook-
ing demonstrations from 11 a.m.–2 
p.m. Graduate students and faculty 
even got their own demonstration in 
Schatz Dining Hall, ensuring that no 
member of the campus community 
felt left out of this event.
The welcome area on the ?rst 
?oor of the UC seemed to be the 
most accessible and attended part 
of the event. Passers-by could take 
a moment to write what health and 
wellness meant to them on a card 
and post it to a board to receive a free 
reusable water bottle. 
Such free items are part of a trend 
for the administration. They use 
free goods to draw people in, but of-
ten they become a crutch on which 
events and activities rely, similar to 
when a professor ?ourishes candy 
or cookies to capture students’ at-
tentions. This was nearly the case 
for “Exploring Health, Discover-
ing Wellness,” since many people 
just grabbed a water bottle and left. 
Groups planning an event should 
be cautious of this tendency in the 
future, and should try to advertise 
more selling points than free gifts.
Under Construction an invaluable opportunity 
On Saturday Feb. 22, Dietrich 
College of Humanities and Social 
Sciences hosted its second annual 
networking event Under Construc-
tion: Building Your Future. Under 
Construction is a conference in-
tended to give humanities students 
the opportunity to interact with suc-
cessful Carnegie Mellon alumni who 
have degrees in subjects like ethics, 
history, and public policy (EHPP) or 
creative writing, rather than engi-
neering or computer science.
The conference was not an intern-
ship fair, but many alumni provided 
helpful suggestions about job hunt-
ing and explained their personal 
journeys to the professions they cur-
rently have. The second Under Con-
struction was a vast improvement 
upon the ?rst. 
Last year, the conference was 
hosted off campus, which made it 
more dif?cult to get to and, there-
fore, discouraged student involve-
ment. This year, the conference 
took place on the second ?oor of the 
University Center, which was much 
more accessible for students. Under 
Construction was also much better 
advertised this year than last, which 
meant that more students had the 
opportunity to participate. 
The conference did not merely re-
cycle alumni from last year’s event; 
this year’s crop of speakers was a 
wide-ranging and diverse group, 
with many unique experiences to 
share with students. There was a 
panel on editing and publishing, an-
other on nongovernmental organiza-
tions (NGOs), as well as one on gov-
ernment and politics, among many 
others. Under Construction was an 
admirable effort on the part of Diet-
rich College to help students plan for 
their future careers. 
When a student studies some-
thing like computer science or engi-
neering, a career path can be rela-
tively easy to ?nd — though work 
intensive to follow — because those 
skills are currently in high demand.
Career paths for humanities ma-
jors, meanwhile, can be harder to 
envision and plan out, and so inter-
action with successful alumni is an 
invaluable experience for humani-
ties students. The keynote speaker, 
Terry Babcock-Lumish, advised stu-
dents to keep an open mind and ac-
cept whatever opportunities come 
their way. Under Construction was 
an indispensable opportunity from 
which all Dietrich students could 
bene?t.
Cutting defense budget proposal long-needed
Secretary of Defense Chuck Ha-
gel has recommended deep cuts in 
the Pentagon’s budget, citing the 
immense size of the defense budget 
as well as the shifting landscape of 
wartime combat.
Hagel addressed Congress, rec-
ommending the decrease of the 
physical size of the military to be-
tween 440,000 and 450,000 active-
duty members, the smallest it would 
be since the military buildup imme-
diately prior to World War II, in ad-
dition to cuts in housing allowances 
and other military bene?ts. Hagel 
reasoned that the United States 
Armed Forces must adjust to ?ghting 
smaller, more higher-tech wars, with 
the probability of the United States 
engaging in a large ground war be-
coming more unlikely. Addition-
ally, Hagel mentioned the large size 
of U.S. budget devoted to military 
spending, and stated that targeted 
and anticipated cuts would be less 
damaging than a Congress sequester.
Hagel’s recommendation shows 
not only a well-reasoned grasp of the 
United States’ ?scal and military po-
sition, but also a great deal of cour-
age. Directly after the announce-
ment, members of Congress vowed 
to ?ght this proposal, one which 
Hagel appears ready to publicly de-
fend. Additionally, with a ballooning 
de?cit and formidable national debt, 
Hagel has recognized the dire state 
of the government’s ?nances. With 
19 percent of the 2012 budget de-
voted to defense and military spend-
ing, totaling $689 billion, this area of 
funding must be trimmed to ensure 
long-term economic stability.
Hagel is a defense secretary who 
has offered to cut his own budget. 
Recognizing the national problem 
our country faces and offering to 
contribute to a solution is a praise-
worthy action, and one that adjusts 
the U.S. military to the realities and 
necessities of 21st-century warfare.
Arizona victory advances LGBTQ rights momentum
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
It has been a striking few weeks 
for LGBTQ rights both nationwide 
and internationally. Texas over-
turned its ban on same-sex mar-
riage, Kentucky was ordered to 
recognize out-of-state marriages, 
and Arizona vetoed controversial SB 
1062 — a law which would have al-
lowed businesses to deny services to 
LGBTQ individuals on the basis of 
“religious liberty.”
Evidently, the United States LG-
BTQ movement has been gaining 
momentum. Since the Supreme 
Court appealed the Defense of Mar-
riage Act (DOMA) last June, no state 
has dared oppose the precedent set 
by United States v. Windsor. In the 
last three months alone, state judges 
in Utah, Oklahoma, and Virginia 
have stepped away from same-sex 
marriage bans and brought their 
respective states one step closer to 
full marriage equality. The attorney 
generals of Pennsylvania, Nevada, 
and Oregon have stopped defending 
their states’ bans, and as many as 
26 states have similar cases against 
bans pending, according to USA 
Today.
It seems that Windsor pushed 
the tides, turning hyperspeed in fa-
vor of LGBTQ rights. Disregarding 
certain conservative strongholds in 
the South — though Texas and Ken-
tucky were a pleasant surprise — 
any state bringing marriage equal-
ity to court in the current political 
climate would be hard-pressed both 
legally and socially to stem the ?ow 
of progress.
Additionally, economics has been 
playing an increasingly important 
role in bolstering LGBTQ interests. 
This is evidenced by the recent trend 
in conservative politics of proposing 
legislation — meant to protect reli-
gious liberty — that permits, if not 
encourages, discrimination against 
the LGBTQ community.
Economically, such legislation 
was bound to fail. In the days be-
fore she vetoed SB 1062, Arizona 
Governor Jan Brewer was barraged 
with messages from local businesses 
and major national companies alike, 
warning her that legalizing dis-
crimination would be a fatal blow 
to the state’s economic growth, ac-
cording to MSNBC. With a majority 
of Americans in favor of marriage 
equality, companies that align them-
selves with hateful policies risk los-
ing a vital proportion of their con-
sumer base. Corporate America is 
proclaiming support for the LGBTQ 
community louder than ever before 
simply because they cannot afford to 
behave otherwise.
Moreover, SB 1062 and its imi-
tators have a weak legal standing. 
Even if it had passed in Arizona, 
the bill almost certainly would have 
been challenged in federal court. 
The Supreme Court has historically 
abided by the principle that any one 
person’s religious freedom should 
be protected so long as it does not 
infringe on the freedoms of anyone 
else. Religious liberty cannot legally 
excuse racial or gender discrimina-
tion, and the same standard should 
transfer naturally to discrimination 
on the basis of sexual orientation.
It is true and terrible irony that 
conservatives have been playing 
the persecution card to justify in-
fringing on the rights of LGBTQ 
individuals. In one illuminating in-
terview, Anderson Cooper grilled 
Senator Al Melvin (R–Ariz.), who 
was in support of the bill. The sena-
tor theorized vaguely and warned 
of oncoming injustice, but — when 
pressed — failed to cite one concrete 
example of a religious person being 
discriminated against for exercising 
his or her beliefs in Arizona.
Meanwhile, LGBTQ individuals 
hardly have to struggle for evidence 
of infringement against their basic 
rights as American citizens. Com-
paring the struggles of the LGBTQ 
community to the supposed perse-
cution of the religious is no compari-
son at all. 
In the end, SB 1062 and similar 
measures are nothing more than 
conservatives whining over hav-
ing to treat everyone with decency. 
These laws represent an increasing-
ly desperate effort by bigots to stand 
their ground on the wrong side of 
history.
Arizona serves as evidence that 
the majority will not tolerate dis-
crimination, thereby weakening the 
excuses of conservatives and fur-
thering the progress of the LGBTQ 
movement.

A PERSON’S OPINION
March 3, 2014 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A9
Compiled by  Sara Remi Fields
The Tartan is ready for some rest and relaxation this week. So we asked,
What are you doing for Spring Break?
Rule of law preservation is a necessity
KYLE HENSON
When I visited Italy last semes-
ter, I went to the beautiful island of 
Capri, where one can ?nd the famed 
Blue Grotto. Usually, to see the grot-
to, one would have to pay a dude 
with a boat to take them inside. But 
because I was almost out of money, 
I wanted to swim inside once all the 
boats had left — for free. I searched 
the Internet to ?nd people who had 
done this to make sure it was safe, 
and I discovered that it was perfectly 
hazard-free, but also illegal. One 
commenter, however, suggested that 
swimming in the Blue Grotto was not 
actually illegal, but instead just “Ital-
ian Illegal.”
By this post, the commenter ref-
erenced the plethora of Italian laws 
that outlawed something that was 
done all the time with no conse-
quences, even if confronted by the 
police. For instance, when you get 
off the train in Naples and someone 
shoves an iPad in your face that may 
have been stolen, that’s illegal. But 
enough greasy-haired men offered 
me “special price, just for you, be-
cause you so savvy,” that I got the 
feeling it was done all the time.
One of the things that made the 
United States different from other 
countries at its inception was that it 
was governed by the rule of law, and 
not the rule of rulers. 
That’s why our carefully limited 
executive branch enforces laws, but 
doesn’t legislate. Then, when the ex-
ecutive branch messes up, it’s held 
in check by both elections and the 
judicial system.
Recently, the rule of law has erod-
ed in this country. In response to the 
discriminatory laws pushed in Arizo-
na and Kansas, attorney general Eric 
Holder told the attorneys general of 
other states that they didn’t have to 
defend such laws if they didn’t be-
lieve in them. 
While noble, that’s still the job 
of the attorney general, and ignor-
ing that job for one law sets a very 
dangerous precedent. If attorneys 
general can ignore one law, why 
not any law? Additionally, President 
Obama’s many changes to the Afford-
able Care Act raise questions. The act 
mandates that employers with over 
50 employees provide health insur-
ance to all full-time employees start-
ing in 2014.
 “While it sounds 
nice on the surface 
to just ignore 
discriminatory acts, 
or delay unpopular 
provisions of laws 
until after elections, 
that’s just not how 
a democracy is 
run.”
Last year, Obama changed this 
provision so that employers don’t 
have to start providing coverage 
until 2015. Policies would start get-
ting canceled in October 2014 — as 
they started getting canceled for in-
dividuals in October 2013 when the 
individual mandate kicked in — and 
small businesses would be transi-
tioned to federal exchanges. Then, 
Obama changed the provision again 
so that companies didn’t have to 
start providing coverage until 2016, 
conveniently after 2014 midterm 
elections. Even in 2016, companies 
only have to cover 90 percent of their 
employees.
This precedent gives any future 
president the ability to delay the em-
ployer mandate even longer. Why 
not? If a Republican president gets 
elected in 2016, there’s ample prec-
edent for him to delay the employer 
mandate inde?nitely. He could even 
delay the individual mandate if he 
wanted to. In fact, he could just 
amend the act into oblivion via ex-
ecutive order.
As much as I’d love for that to 
happen, that’s not how the rule of 
law works. A new leader shouldn’t 
be able to change whatever laws he 
or she wants whenever he or she 
desires. While it sounds nice on the 
surface to just ignore discriminatory 
acts, or delay unpopular provisions 
of laws until after elections, that’s 
not how an effective democracy is 
run.
John Adams wrote about this 
topic extensively. As an ardent Fed-
eralist, he believed that a govern-
ment with more power could use 
it constructively to do good for the 
people, but he believed in checks 
and balances so that this power 
couldn’t run amok and turn into tyr-
anny. He called the government one 
“of laws, rather than a government 
of men.” Our government is becom-
ing a government of men, and we’re 
not far from creating a class of laws 
that don’t make actions illegal, just, 
“American Illegal.”

U.S. indifferent to Yahoo privacy breach
BRANDON SCHMUCK
Having an intimate conversation 
with your signi?cant other over Ya-
hoo Messenger? You might not be 
the only one watching.
According to a report by The 
Guardian, based on documents 
leaked by Edward Snowden, the 
Government Communications Head-
quarters (GCHQ), a British spy orga-
nization, engaged in a project called 
Optic Nerve, which collected and 
stored millions of still images from 
more than 1.8 million Yahoo users 
around the world in six months of 
2008 alone.
Perhaps the most frightening 
thing about this surveillance is the 
manner in which these images were 
collected — in bulk from everyday 
Yahoo Messenger users every ?ve 
minutes. According to the report, the 
GCHQ was using this information 
both to aid in facial recognition soft-
ware and to ?nd existing and new  
terrorist suspects. Unsurprisingly ,    
the National Security Agency (NSA) 
was also aiding this effort, and the 
scale of this project grew much larg-
er than spying on a few “suspected 
terrorists.”
To make matters worse, the 
GCHQ even compiled a report re-
garding the percentage of images 
collected containing “undesirable 
nudity,” which they estimated to be 
between three and 11 percent. This 
reported percentage reveals that 
since 2008, the GCHQ has been an 
unwelcome guest in the intimate 
conversations of thousands, if not 
millions, of people worldwide.
When informed about GCHQ and 
the NSA’s actions, Yahoo “reacted 
furiously,” according to The Guard-
ian. They accused the agencies of “a 
whole new level of violation of our 
users’ privacy,” and were clearly dis-
gusted by such a violation.
Despite the fact that they may be 
morally opposed to the collection of 
such information, companies have 
no real choice in the matter, as orga-
nizations such as the NSA and GCHQ 
will continue to collect information 
from their servers until the interna-
tional community becomes outraged 
enough. Unfortunately, as reports of 
Edward Snowden and the NSA begin 
to die down in the media, it does not 
look like public opinion will spur this 
type of action anytime soon.
With every report, it becomes 
more evident that spy organizations 
have been collecting unauthorized 
information from us for much lon-
ger than we have realized. Has 1984 
?nally arrived? Unfortunately, it ap-
pears to be here, but the internation-
al community has become so used to 
being devoid of privacy that no one 
even cares anymore.
Perhaps if the GCHQ were steal-
ing nude images of Yahoo users ten 
years ago, this story would be one of 
the main headlines of the year. How-
ever, we have become so used to the 
idea of being spied on that we are 
indifferent about privacy, something 
that our founding fathers saw as so 
important that its protection was 
written as the Fourth Amendment of 
America’s Bill of Rights.

XIYU WANG
In a recent article in The New 
York Times, Laszlo Bock — the se-
nior vice president of people opera-
tions at Google — elaborated on his 
comments from an interview last 
June, in which he stated that GPA, 
college pedigree, test scores, and 
brainteasers were all worthless in 
making hiring decisions. What was 
effective, Bock said, were behavioral 
interviews with a consistent rubric 
to ?nd applicants who showed lead-
ership, intellectual ?exibility, and 
responsibility.
These words would seem like 
good news for anyone who just 
failed their midterms. If you meet 
the above quali?cations, simply quit 
Carnegie Mellon, and apply for a job 
at Google!
In all seriousness though, there 
have been a number of negative 
reactions surrounding Bock’s com-
ments. Many of those who posted 
comments on the article have 
criticized Mr. Bock’s comments as 
disingenuous. 
The second-highest-ranked com-
ment is from one MetroJournalist, 
who states “… this is the sort of bab-
ble that all executives like to spew. It 
doesn’t really mean anything. How 
do you get a job at Google, AT&T, or 
anywhere else? It’s about illusion. 
People do not hire you for your ac-
tual abilities, but what they think 
you can do, based on how well you 
present yourself.”
As someone who has been ap-
plying for internships these past 
few months, I understand the Me-
troJournalist’s cynicism about the 
job market. Nonetheless, Bock’s 
statements represent a positive step 
forward that may lead to improve-
ments in the job-searching process.
First of all, Google’s assertions 
are based on more than conjecture. 
These results have been derived 
from Google’s own internal study on 
hiring and work performance. While 
it’s ambiguous how Google mea-
sures work performance, it is a posi-
tive step in itself that Google is ques-
tioning whether its hiring processes 
are working in the ?rst place. Too 
often, companies are overcon?dent 
in their own abilities; if the company 
makes a bad hire, it is that employee 
who failed to live up to company ex-
pectations, rather than ?aws within 
the recruitment process.
Bock’s comments also serve as 
acknowledgment that many of the 
current metrics on which compa-
nies base their hiring decisions on 
are ?awed. According to a study in 
the Teachers College Record, grade 
in?ation has become so bad that 
“A” is now the most common grade 
across college campuses. As such, it 
is questionable whether GPA is still 
a good predictor of future work per-
formance. Even worse, some com-
panies still ask applicants for SAT 
scores, which is baf?ing since SAT 
scores are not even good predictors 
of ?rst year college performance, as  
ABC News reports.
Some may argue that Bock’s com-
ments cannot be applied to compa-
nies in general, since job candidates 
for Google are top talent, and at that 
tier, metrics like GPA matter less. 
However, this factor should not 
change the fact that companies 
should be testing their recruitment 
processes to make sure that they are 
effective, and that companies should 
continually work to ?nd more accu-
rate ways to determine a candidate’s 
ability. Hopefully, more companies 
will follow Google’s footsteps in this 
regard. Companies should be just 
as intelligent and innovative as the 
candidates they seek to hire.

I wish to notify the Carnegie 
Mellon campus community about a 
recent death on campus. The Mill-
er Gallery, located in the Purnell 
Building, has just suffered a recent 
change that resulted in the loss of a 
critically acclaimed gallery presence 
on our campus. The gallery would 
have been celebrating its 7th year of 
prestige this August.
In January 2014, College of Fine 
Arts Dean Dan Martin eliminated 
the curatorial position within the 
gallery. Astria Suparak held this 
position. 
The elimination of Ms. Suparak’s 
position was done so that the gallery 
can now focus on student and facul-
ty work rather than bringing outside 
shows, which are what bring the 
gallery national acclaim and a pres-
tigious name.
From the most recent show, Alien 
She, to past shows such as Intimate 
Science, The Miller Gallery gained 
signi?cant publicity in the art world 
outside of just Pittsburgh. The shows 
curated and brought in by Ms. Su-
parak resulted in large publicity for 
the gallery. The most recent show, 
Alien She, received a “Critics’ Pick!” 
article in ArtForum International 
Magazine and mentions in The Huff-
ington Post, along with countless 
other publications. These publica-
tions, along with others of past ex-
hibitions that Ms. Suparak brought 
into the gallery, are what gave this 
gallery located on a college campus 
a highly recognized name within the 
art world.
The art world will continue to 
remember The Miller Gallery’s pres-
ence and impact over the last six 
years as the gallery disappears into 
the Carnegie Mellon ‘bubble’ that it 
worked so hard to get out of.
See rip-miller-gallery.tumblr.com

past prestige.

Men’s and women’s basketball teams fall to Spartans
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
This Saturday the men’s 
and women’s Carnegie Mellon 
University basketball teams 
both ended their seasons in a 
doubleheader at home against 
Case Western Reserve Univer-
sity. Both the men’s and wom-
en’s teams recognized their 
seniors for all they had done 
to send them out on a high 
note. Alas, the best laid plans 
of mice and men oft go astray 
and both teams faltered.
The women started off 
the doubleheader and came 
out with a vengeance, rush-
ing out to a quick 11–5 lead in 
the ?rst ?ve minutes. It looked 
like the Tartans were ready to 
dominate, with several players 
slicing through the defense for 
high-percentage layups. 
After back-to-back jump 
shots by the team’s two senior 
guards, Jacquie Shaw and 
Jennifer Elkin, gave Carnegie 
Mellon its six-point lead, the 
Spartans battled back.
Several times Case Western 
brought the lead to within one 
point, but the Tartans were 
ready with an answer until 
less than 10 minutes remained 
in the half and a three-pointer 
by the Spartans gave the visi-
tors their ?rst lead. 
Teams traded the lead 
back and forth for the next 
few minutes, each struggling 
to get an edge. Finally, Case 
Western went on an 8–0 run 
and stretched their lead out to 
eight points. The Tartans were 
able to keep up somewhat 
down the stretch and con-
tained the damage to a 36–29 
de?cit going into half.
Coming out of half, the 
Tartans slowly whittled away 
at the lead until junior guard 
Chandler Cau?eld tied the 
game with a three-pointer 
with just over 15 minutes 
left in the game. From that 
point on, the teams kept the 
game fairly even, trading 
three-pointers and layups un-
til under a minute was left in 
the game. After a free throw 
by ?rst-year center-forward 
Lisa Murphy drew Carnegie 
Mellon to within one point, 
a three-point dagger by the 
Spartans made it a two posses-
sion game.
After Murphy missed a 
jump shot on the other end 
of the court, the Tartans had 
no choice but to intentionally 
foul and hope for missed free 
throws. Lucky for the Tar-
tans, they got their wish and 
two missed free throws by the 
Spartans and a three-pointer 
from junior forward Liza Otto 
gave them the ball down three 
with four seconds left and no 
timeouts.
Otto was able to get the ball 
on the other side of half court 
before heaving up the tying 
prayer. Sadly for the Tartans, 
the ball bounced off the rim 
and then careened harmlessly 
away from the basket as the 
buzzer sounded. Shaw led the 
Tartans with 38 minutes and 
20 points, while Murphy and 
Otto both recorded double-
double.
For the men, the game was 
never close. The last lead the 
Tartans held in the game was 
just over four minutes in as se-
nior forward Rob Mohen and 
senior forward-guard Chris-
tian Manoli combined for 
Carnegie Mellon’s ?rst nine 
points.
From that point on, the 
Tartans had no answer for the 
Spartans’ offensive attack, 
with Case Western dominat-
ing in all aspects, shooting 50 
percent from the ?eld for the 
game to match a blistering 
38.1 percent from the three-
point line and a perfect 14–14 
from the free throw line.
The only hope for Carnegie 
Mellon was their three-point 
shooting, but a rough night 
shooting less than 20 percent 
from beyond the arc damp-
ened any hopes of a senior day 
comeback.
While they ultimately out-
scored Case Western in the 
second half by a point, it was 
far too little too late. 
The only advantage of the 
blowout was that it allowed 
each coach to separately sub 
out their seniors with a few 
minutes remaining, allowing 
them to individually be ap-
plauded for the service they 
gave to their schools over 
their careers. Manoli led the 
Tartans with 23 points and 10 
rebounds.
As each team says goodbye 
to its seniors and looks to-
ward next season, they are in 
two very different spots. The 
women are only losing two ro-
tation players and a dominant 
season by Murphy gives them 
hope for the future. 
The men, on the other 
hand, are losing a hefty ma-
jority of their rotation players, 
and will be looking for many 
players to step up their game 
next season if they hope to 
compete.

Sophomore forward Liza Otto jumped above Case Western defenders to make a shot this Saturday in Weigand Gymnasium. Unfortunately, the momentum did not continue, and both the 
men’s and women’s teams were unable to defeat the Case Western Spartans.

Jason Collins ?nally got 
his chance at history Sunday 
night nearly 10 months after 
he came out as an openly gay 
NBA player. Not even receiv-
ing an invite to training camp, 
many questioned if Collins, 
who was set to become a free 
agent at the time of his an-
nouncement, would also be 
the ?rst openly gay player to 
play a game in the NBA.
The Brooklyn Nets, in what 
they claim was purely a bas-
ketball-motivated decision, 
signed Collins as a center to 
a 10-day contract on Sunday 
and had him on the court that 
night against the Los Angeles 
Lakers. Collins’ playing time 
may be short-lived given the 
brief nature of the contract 
signed by Collins. The Nets 
have the option of re-signing 
Collins to an additional 10-day 
deal after this one expires but 
are then forced to either wave 
him, likely ending his season, 
or sign him for the remainder 
of the season.
Collins made waves when 
he stepped on the court part-
way through the second 
quarter, with ESPN, Sports Il-
lustrated, Buzzfeed and many 
other sports and non-sports 
news outlets tracking his 
movements all night. Speak-
ing to a packed news confer-
ence, Collins received nothing 
but praise, which was com-
pletely unwarranted from his 
underwhelming stat line: 11 
minutes, 0–1 shooting, two 
rebounds, one steal and ?ve 
fouls. Most of Collins’s contri-
butions don’t show up on a tra-
ditional stat line, so this wasn’t 
a necessarily bad night for the 
big man, but it also normally 
wouldn’t have warranted a 
press conference, much less a 
full house.
In a strange coincidence of 
sports timing, Michael Sam, 
the ?rst openly gay NFL pros-
pect, was at the Scouting Com-
bine over the weekend. Simi-
lar to Collins, Sam had a huge 
turnout for his media session. 
The unknowledgeable observ-
er wouldn’t have been faulted 
for believing he was walk-
ing into the press conference 
for former Heisman-winning 
quarterback Johnny Manziel 
or potential ?rst-overall draft 
pick defensive end Jadeveon 
Clowney, not a middle-to-low 
round player. Much like Col-
lins, Sam’s on-the-?eld perfor-
mance was completely unwor-
thy of all the media attention. 
There is no denying that 
Sam and Collins are more 
notable for their off-?eld 
lives than their athletic per-
formance. Hundreds of play-
ers who will likely be drafted 
higher and/or have better NFL 
careers were at the Combine 
from Feb. 22–25, but no one 
cared. These players have to 
earn their media attention. 
The NBA had to make an ex-
ception to its jersey sales rules 
to actually print and sell Col-
lins jerseys to meet the un-
precedented demand, even 
though he may only be on the 
team for 10 days. His jersey is 
out-selling many of the NBA 
All-Stars.
It’s easy to see this situation 
and think that a story is being 
created out of nothing. The 
only meaningful qualities of 
these players when compared 
to their peers is their openness 
about their sexual orientation. 
Many of us would like to think 
we are an accepting enough 
society that one’s sexual ori-
entation is just one aspect of 
their character, along with 
their sex, race, and religion, 
and all of the other factors 
that determine what kind of 
human being someone is.
This sense of equality is 
sadly a falsity that has per-
vaded our society. Discrimina-
tion in America is not as bru-
tally apparent as it once was, 
but that by no way means that 
it is not still prevalent in our 
culture. Just as with all forms 
of entertainment, sports is a 
re?ection of our own beliefs. 
Entertainment is designed to 
appeal to the masses, and no 
one wants to see things they 
do not agree with. That’s why 
it is such a big deal when the 
social issues that divide the 
nation are dealt with on a na-
tional scale. This type of social 
litmus test is one of the only 
true ways to see exactly where 
the nation sits on these contro-
versial issues.
As much as we would like 
for an openly gay player in the 
NFL or NBA to be a non-issue, 
politics has shown in the past 
week that social inequality for 
LGBTQ people is very much 
still around. The most dramat-
ic and headline-grabbing ex-
ample of this inequality is Ari-
zona’s religious freedom bill. 
This bill, which was vetoed by 
Arizona governor Jan Brewer 
on Wednesday night, sought 
to appeal to the First Amend-
ment right to free expression 
of religion.
The bill posited that any 
business owner should be free 
from litigation if they choose 
to deny someone service due 
to a con?ict with their reli-
gious beliefs. The example 
cited by one of the Arizona 
state senators who voted for 
the bill was a Jewish catering 
company that refused to sup-
ply pork for an event. The true 
protections in this bill were 
meant to help Christian shop 
owners, particularly those in 
wedding-related businesses, 
from having to compromise 
their beliefs to serve same-sex 
couples.
There is a fundamental 
difference between these two 
examples. In the catering ex-
ample, the Jewish owners are 
choosing not to serve pork to 
any of their customers, regard-
less of their sexual orientation, 
race, or religion. This choice is 
perfectly acceptable. For the 
same reason, I can’t demand a 
sushi restaurant to serve me a 
T-bone steak. A customer has 
no reasonable expectation of 
being served pork if they con-
tact a catering service that ex-
plicitly does not serve pork.
The real-life wedding ex-
amples are very different situ-
ations. In these instances, the 
owners are refusing to provide 
a service they would normally 
give to customers because of 
the sexual orientation, race, 
or religion of those customers. 
The bill would have essentially 
made discrimination legal and 
businesses would be able to 
hang signs in their windows 
saying “We Won’t Serve Gays,” 
just like the “Coloreds Only” 
signs of the pre-civil rights 
movement or the “Irish Need 
Not Apply” signs at the turn of 
the 20th century.
As one might expect, there 
was a massive uproar over this 
bill and it was vetoed for the 
second time, although the ?rst 
veto occurred mostly because 
Brewer was protesting the 
state congress’s refusal to pass 
a budget. Many politicians — 
including both Arizona sena-
tors — and several businesses, 
like Apple Inc., begged Brewer 
to veto, but the NFL had the 
biggest threat to hold over 
Arizona’s head. The Glendale/
Phoenix area is set to host the 
2015 Super Bowl, but the NFL 
threatened to move the event 
if the bill passed. This threat 
was not an idle one, as the 
NFL previously moved a Super 
Bowl out of Arizona in 1992 
when the state refused to rec-
ognize Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Day as a national holiday.
The NFL is also being at-
tacked for its acceptance of 
Sam and any other out future 
NFL player on the federal lev-
el. Jack Burkman, a federal 
lobbyist, went on a local Wash-
ington, D.C. news station to 
announce his proposal to push 
a bill through Congress that 
would ban openly gay players 
from playing in the NFL. Burk-
man claims that 36 members 
of the house and six in the 
Senate will sign on over the 
next three weeks.
At ?rst glance, this plan 
may seem ridiculous, but un-
der current federal law, dis-
crimination against employ-
ees due to sexual orientation 
is completely legal. Discrimi-
nation is simply a fact of life 
for the LGBTQ community, as 
Congress refuses to pass the 
Employment Non-Discrimina-
tion Act and 29 states do not 
have their own protections.
As much as we would all 
like to think that LGBTQ dis-
crimination is a non-story, 
the sad fact of the matter is 
it’s not. Though Collins’s and 
Sam’s sexual orientations 
should be a non-issue, the sad 
state of protections for LGBTQ 
people mean that sexual ori-
entation is still an issue in our 
culture, whether we want to 
talk about it or not. Therefore, 
their stories cannot be erased 
or ignored, as that act contrib-
utes to government-approved 
discrimination of an entire 
minority.

NISHANT RENIWAL
Junior Staffwriter
Pittsburgh is one of the 
few cities in the country that 
can boast a top-level team in 
three of the four major Ameri-
can professional leagues. 
The Steelers, Penguins, and 
Pirates are all well-known 
and highly-regarded teams in 
their own sport. Pennsylvania 
also has one of the larger NBA 
franchises in the Philadelphia 
76ers. 
The one major sport not 
well known in this city is soc-
cer. The Major Soccer League 
(MLS) has yet to reach the 
heights in popularity that the 
other four sports enjoy, and 
with no Pennsylvania soc-
cer team, it’s hard to see the 
sport having any major de-
velopment in this state. How-
ever, all that may be about 
to change with the Guinness 
International Champions Cup 
starting at the end of July.
This cup began last year, 
when eight teams were split 
into groups of two and played 
out a round-robin format to 
determine two group win-
ners. The group winners then 
contested in a ?nal to deter-
mine the winner of the cup. 
Returning from last year’s 
edition are defending champi-
ons Real Madrid from Spain, 
and Italian powerhouses A.C. 
Milan and Inter Milan. 
The new teams to play in 
this year’s cup are current 
Premier League champions 
Manchester United, Man-
chester City and Liverpool 
from England, A.S. Roma, 
also from Italy, and Olympia-
cos from Greece. Unlike last 
year however, Pittsburgh is 
hosting a matchup between 
two of these European heavy-
weights; Manchester City and 
A.C. Milan are going head-to-
head at Heinz Field on July 
27.
This matchup provides the 
people of Pittsburgh with the 
opportunity to view some of 
Europe’s ?nest ?rsthand. Soc-
cer has never received high 
levels of exposure in Pitts-
burgh, and a top-tier game 
taking place at one of the 
most well-known locations in 
the city may be just the pub-
licity it requires.
The matchup itself prom-
ises to be an enticing one, as 
Manchester City is arguably 
the favorite for the title this 
season in the Premier League 
while Milan is currently en-
during one of its worst sea-
sons in recent history. 
Manchester City has the 
star power, with household 
names such as striker Sergio
 Aguero, mid?eld David Silva, 
and mid?elder Yaya Touré, 
among others. On the other 
hand, A.C. Milan can only 
boast striker Mario Balotelli 
and mid?elder Kaká as play-
ers of world class caliber. 
However, it’s a cup game in 
the preseason for both teams 
and, more likely than not, 
new additions to the team in 
the summer are going to be 
involved, and there is going to 
be a lot tactical tinkering from 
both coaches. 
Manchester City manager 
Manuel Pellegrini is known 
for his penchant for all-out 
attacking soccer, but rookie 
manager Clarence Seedorf is 
slowly coming into his own 
for A.C. Milan and has set 
about salvaging something 
from their disastrous season. 
What this match promises 
is some breathtaking soccer 
by both teams, since it is only 
a preseason game and doesn’t 
affect their season much.
As for the cup as a whole, 
Real Madrid seems set to 
defend their title. They still 
boast recently-crowned best 
player in the world forward 
Cristiano Ronaldo in their 
ranks and have a formidable 
running mate for him in his 
successor as the world’s most 
expensive winger, Gareth 
Bale. 
Madrid has been on a tear 
recently, and it’s hard to envi-
sion a team stopping them. 
This cup might mean a lot 
more to Manchester United 
and A.C. Milan than others, 
as they are the most likely to 
conduct a squad overhaul in 
the summer transfer window, 
and this cup gives them the 
opportunity to try out forma-
tions and tactical plans. 
The likes of Manchester 
City and Liverpool are look-
ing to gain some additional 
exposure on the international 
stage and begin to reap in the 
money from lucrative spon-
sorship deals that come with 
being recognized at this level. 
The likes of A.S. Roma, 
Inter Milan, and Olympiacos 
are all big clubs in their own 
right. A.S. Roma and Olym-
piacos are having stellar sea-
sons too, but are simply using 
this competition as means to 
set up groundwork to exploit 
new markets abroad. 
They are unlikely to ever 
be as well known as the oth-
ers, but competitions like 
the Guinness International 
Champions Cup give them a 
chance to show international 
audiences that they can com-
pete with the best for all top 
trophies.
The prospect of viewing 
such teams live should be an 
enticing one for Pittsburgh. 
The city prides itself on being 
a fervent supporter of each of 
the three teams it is home to, 
so there may be no possibility 
currently for soccer to make 
its way into the hearts of Pitts-
burghers. 
But who knows? One day, 
Pennsylvania may just be add-
ing an MLS team, with this 
cup at the heart of the begin-
ning of soccer in this state and 
city.

This weekend the ninth-
ranked Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity women’s tennis team 
played in the 2014 ITA Na-
tional Team Indoor Champion-
ship. They had a fantastic run, 
beating 12th-ranked Washing-
ton University in St. Louis in 
the quarter?nals and eighth-
ranked University of Chicago 
in the semi?nals before facing 
Johns Hopkins University in a 
rematch of last year’s champi-
onships, where the Tartans fell 
5–4 to the Blue Jays.
On Friday against Wash-
ington, the Tartans took care 
of business against another 
nationally-ranked opponent, 
easily dispatching the Bears 
6–3 and moving on to their 
sixth straight semi?nal.
Junior Bryn Raschke and 
?rst-year Vanessa Pavia set 
the tone for the match, win-
ning the number-one doubles 
match 8–3 and getting help 
from senior Katie Cecil and 
?rst-year Nicholle Torres in 
the third doubles game to give 
Carnegie Mellon the early 
2–1 lead. Junior Angela Pratt, 
along with Pavia, Torres, and 
Cecil, each won her singles 
match to seal the victory. It 
was a swift win for the Tar-
tans, with only Pavia needing 
more than two sets to dispatch 
her opponent. The two losing 
Tartans, sophomores Brooke 
Tsu and Elizabeth Martin, both 
forced tiebreaker sets before ?-
nally failing.
Saturday saw Carnegie 
Mellon dispatch University of 
Chicago, 7–2, to punch their 
ticket to their third consecu-
tive ?nals match. Rashcke and 
Pavia, along with Torres and 
new partner, junior Lydia Ut-
kin, continued their winning 
ways, taking their doubles 
matches again.
The only real difference for 
the Tartans between this game 
and the previous one against 
Washington was how ?ve of 
the women took their singles 
matchups. Pratt, Cecil, Torres 
and Martin all won in straight 
sets. Pavia dropped her ?rst 
set, but then battled back to 
take the last two sets and the 
victory.
On Sunday, Carnegie Mel-
lon hoped to revenge last 
year’s loss against Johns Hop-
kins University, but a slow 
start in the doubles matches 
set the tone for the match 
that ultimately ended in more 
heartbreak for the Tartans. 
Pavia and Raschke continued 
their doubles winning streak, 
but required a tiebreaker to 
pull out the win. Utkin and 
Torres had a bad day, getting 
destroyed 1–8.
The Tartans tried to mount 
a comeback in the singles 
matches, but Tsu and Pratt fell 
in straight sets. Pavia, being in 
the opposite position from the 
day before, won her ?rst set 
before dropping the next two, 
clinching the victory for the 
Blue Jays, who ultimately went 
on to win 8–1 after sweeping 
the rest of the singles matches.
While this loss is a disap-
pointment for the team, they 
still have the outdoor season 
ahead of them as they work to-
ward the UAA Championships 
in late April.

On Friday and Saturday, 
the Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity men’s and women’s track 
and ?eld teams competed in 
the University Athletic Associ-
ation (UAA) Indoor Track and 
Field Championships, hosted 
by Brandeis University.
The men’s team put up a 
strong overall performance, 
placing second as a team and 
bringing home two individual 
titles.
By far, the strongest event 
for the men was the shot put, 
where senior Zachary Erra-
Hernandez defended his title 
and became a three-time UAA 
Champion, winning with a 
distance of 16.13 meters. 
Junior Gino Pilato and 
senior Nathan Cheek also 
placed, taking fourth and ?fth 
place with throws of 14.14 and 
14.01 meters, respectively.
Junior Thomas Vanden-
berg continued his monster 
season, taking home a UAA 
title in the 800–meter run. 
Vandenberg beat his own 
school record with a time of 
1:53.32. He leads the Tar-
tan hopefuls for the NCAA 
Championships taking place 
on March 14–15 at Nebraska 
Wesleyan University. 
Vandenberg is a practi-
cal shoo-in to qualify for the 
800-meter run due to his cur-
rent third overall ranking in 
the nation.
Carnegie Mellon had a 
great showing in the track 
events, placing in the one-
mile run, 3,000-meter run, 
the 4x400-meter relay, and 
twice in the 55-meter hurdles, 
in addition to Vandenberg’s 
800-meter win.
In the ?eld events, the Tar-
tans weren’t quite as domi-
nant, only taking fourth place 
in both the pole vault and 
long jump to go along with 
their shot put wins.
The women had a much 
tougher weekend, ?nishing 
sixth as a team with no indi-
vidual wins.
Senior Jacqueline Guevel 
was the driving force for the 
Tartans, participating in four 
events and placing in three. 
Guevel took third place in 
the 55-meter hurdles with a 
time of 8.64 and sixth in the 
55-meter dash with a time of 
7.56 seconds. 
Guevel, along with junior 
Sasha Spalding and ?rst-years 
Ariel Tian and Emily Swan-
son, helped carry the 4x400-
relay team to a sixth-place 
?nish, crossing the line with a 
time of 4:11.10.
Spalding pulled her share 
of the load in the ?eld events 
as well, placing sixth in the 
long jump with a 4.91-meter 
leap and a fourth place ?nish 
in the shot put. The 10.81-me-
ter throw was also a career 
best for Spalding.
The top-placing individual 
performer for the Tartans was 
?rst-year Rebecca Fortner, 
who placed second in the high 
jump, leaping over the bar set 
at 1.58 meters. 
This great jump helped 
her earn the ?rst of hopefully 
many All-UAA honors for her 
career.
The women’s team is 
unlikely to get any NCAA 
Championship nods, but will 
be back in competition after 
spring break at the Washing-
ton and Lee Track and Field 
Carnival on March 21 at 
Washington and Lee 
University.

Bad Words lives up to its name
Film offers comedic moments, falls short of satisfying
AB Films hosted a free premiere screening of Bad 
Words Thursday night, though it is not set to hit 
theaters with limited release until March 14. If you 
like dark comedies with vulgar humor and one-
dimensional characters, you will love this movie. For 
those seeking a film with substance, the movie falls 
flat.
The story starts with eighth-grade dropout Guy 
Trilby (Jason Bateman) entering and winning a 
spelling bee for middle school students to make up 
for the loss he endured in such a competition when 
he was a child. The action of the story starts with 
Guy on his way to the Golden Quill spelling bee — 
the be-all and end-all of spelling bees in the world. 
While he is there, he endures indignant comments 
and threats from angry parents and spelling bee 
officials who don’t want him to be there, even while 
he breaks no rules by competing.
While his antics throughout the competition are 
meant to provide comedy, the audience does not 
understand his motives or his jaded nature until 
halfway through the movie. At that point, he 
has already proven to be such a jerk, it’s hard to 
sympathize with him despite his sad story. In the 
end, when he accomplishes what he originally sets 
out to do, it’s so inconsequential that the audience 
does not feel the satisfaction or fulfillment they 
should after seeing a film.
One important film element that Bad Words lacked 
was character development. Guy was the only 
character that truly had any depth or experienced 
any real development. Even still, the little backstory 
that the audience got about his character — details 
left out for sake of avoiding spoilers — did not seem 
to justify his off-putting personality and disregard 
for anyone else’s feelings. His character was neither 
fully developed nor relatable.
Maybe Guy would have been tolerable if his foil — 
bright-eyed, innocent, 10-year-old Chaitanya Chopra 
(Rohan Chand) — had remained bright-eyed and 
innocent. Chaitanya immediately becomes lovable 
when he tries to befriend Guy on the way to the 
spelling bee, only to be rejected in a slew of colorful 
language and racist remarks from Guy. However, 
after Guy corrupts him, he experiences just a bit of 
character development. He doesn’t use “bad words” 
at the beginning of the film or show any special 
affinity for prostitutes, but he does both at the end.
Perhaps most disappointingly, Jenny Widgeon 
(Kathryn Hahn), a freelance writer hired by Guy to 
serve as his press sponsor in the spelling bee, gets 
no character development whatsoever. Her character 
shows definite potential for growth, yet remains 
static throughout the film. Jenny is nothing more 
than a nagging presence who serves to reveal a bit 
of backstory on Guy. Hahn has appeared in tons of 
movies (We’re the Millers, The Secret Life of Walter 
Mitty) and TV shows (Parks and Recreation, Girls, 
The Newsroom) and has proven more than capable 
of bringing her characters to life. This problem was 
not one of poor acting; but one of poor writing.
This film is not the place to look for strong female 
characters; there are none to be found. Any woman 
with half a brain is portrayed as annoying, uptight, 
or prudish, and only useful for sex. Jenny, for 
example, repeatedly tells Guy she will not have sex 
with him, and then immediately has sex with him. 
When they are not having sex — and even during 
those scenes — she is naggy and annoying. Dr. 
Bernice Deagan (Allison Janney) is an uptight prude 
whose only source of personal fulfillment is directing 
the spelling bee. These characters finish off the 
list of main female characters, and all other minor 
female characters are either prostitutes or annoying 
tropes that Guy insults colorfully based on their 
sexual activity (or lack thereof).
Characters are such an important part of a film. 
They can make the film relatable, draw the audience 
in, and make the viewers care about what happens 
in the story. These characters were not relatable, 
endearing, or well developed and are arguably the 
biggest shortcoming of the film.
However, comedies are not known for their hard-
hitting plots or moving characters. If you’re looking 
for a superficial comedy with little substance, look 
for this movie in select theaters March 14 and 
nationwide March 28.

Advice for awkward people
Hey Ryan and Matt,
I’m a prospective student, 
and I enjoyed your latest 
column, so I figured I 
would reach out to you 
guys for some guidance. 
I’m interested in starting 
up an advice column 
for my high school’s 
newspaper, and I was 
hoping you guys could 
give me some direction. 
What is your process? 
How do you sort through 
all the requests for 
advice?
I’m dying to know,
Currently Unmewed 
of Reality, Imaginary 
Opportunist, Unique 
Sycophant
Dear CURIOUS,
Although we do this each 
week, Amy Dickinson of 
“Ask Amy” fame is probably 
the expert on advice 
columns, but let’s give this 
one a shot. First, many of 
our loyal, awkward advice 
seekers are normal people 
who live fulfilling lives ... 
entirely in our imaginations. 
Frankly, the way that we 
separate the wheat from 
the chaff has to do with 
what needy, fictitious 
character is screaming 
loudest. We feel obliged 
to get the problems these 
passing thoughts complain 
about on the page for our 
own sanity. We don’t care 
if these characters resolve 
their issues, so long as they 
leave us alone. Think about 
it. If we actually gave good 
advice, we’d be out of a job 
sooner than later. 
Say hello to the Easter 
Bunny for us!
Matt and Ryan
Dear Matt and Ryan,
Ever since I was a toddler, 
I’ve been watching 
Jeopardy! each and 
every weekday night. I 
haven’t missed a single 
episode in more than 15 
years. I have autographed 
pictures of Ken Jennings, 
Brad Rutter, and IBM 
Watson hanging right next 
to my bed. I’m writing 
because whenever I bring 
up my Jeopardy! fandom, 
people give me weird 
looks, and tell me not to 
forget to get to sleep by 
9:30, like I’m some old 
retiree.
Why are people hating on 
my game show?
Tangibly Reavowed; 
Enamored By Empty 
Knowledge
Dear TREBEK, 
This is Carnegie Mellon; 
we have KGB, CS majors, 
the Quidditch team, and a 
Magic: the Gathering club, 
but Jeopardy! fandom takes 
the cake as the most nerdy 
extracurricular interest we 
have ever heard of.
Regardless, the sad fact is 
that Americans generally 
don’t take kindly to show-
offy know-it-alls. Why 
do you think geeks and 
nerds are so ostracized 
in society? Or why is 
Carnegie Mellon where 
all of us congregate? Our 
only advice is to not let the 
haters hate, and let your 
freak flag fly.
How did IBM’s Watson 
autograph a picture?
Ryan and Matt

“A lot of times when I do shows .... I intend to meet you 
where you’re at and bring you to new heights. Meet you 
where you’re low and connect with you there, and then 
bring you up by the end of the show. And that’s kind 
of my philosophy with music now, kind of really hitting 
at the struggles of life and the human experience, and 
making it more bearable .... making struggles laughable, 
almost,” Kai Roberts said with a con?dent air as he 
leaned back in his chair.
Roberts, a senior business administration major with a 
concentration in marketing, released his debut album, 
Carnegie Café last November. The album explores the 
various pressures exerted on college students, most 
notably the extreme stress that a lot of Carnegie Mellon 
students endure. 
However, Roberts pointed out that there is a difference 
between stress and mental health, as stress is a very 
immediate feeling, “an activator of emotional distress,” 
whereas anxiety and depression are more deeply rooted 
in worrying about the future and dealing with the past. 
According to Roberts, “anxiety and worrying about the 
future by way of the past was the driver in Carnegie 
Café.”
“I was just dealing with anxiety issues; they started in 
fall 2012,” Roberts said, speaking about the inspirations 
that germinated the album. “I took [a semester] off so I 
could clear my head, so I could refocus myself and kind 
of vent. Carnegie Café was really that venting process 
.... After a while, it turned into a higher purpose. I really 
want to enlighten people on the ideas of mental health, 
and how to deal with stuff in college, and how to, 
essentially, face yourself.”
An album that helps people face themselves is a tall 
order, but Roberts has experience using music as a tool 
for dealing with the world and interacting with others. 
In high school, he was a member of Arts Greenhouse, 
a hip-hop education program that inspires local teens 
through music. In college, Roberts continued to work 
with the program as a mentor. However, Roberts’s love 
for hip-hop began long before high school.
“The ?rst hip-hop album I remember listening to was 
Snoop Dog’s Doggy Style album. I was like three, but my 
dad would put it on, and we’d just dance,” Roberts said. 
“It was just fun, and I feel like that launched my interest 
in music. A little bit older, my dad started DJing, pretty 
much old school parties, but some younger stuff. There 
was this monthly CD that used to come in the mail — 
I’m not even sure if they still have it — so he would order 
these just to stay up on the new music. And me and my 
brother, we just loved when this CD came. We would 
wait for this CD every month, and every time it would 
come, we’d plug it in and listen to the new music.”
In fact, it was one of these early CDs that prompted 
Roberts’ very ?rst verse. “One CD came in — I don’t 
know if you remember Lil’ Romeo — I was jealous of 
Lil’ Romeo,” Roberts said. “It was like fourth grade.... 
All the girls were talking about him, going ‘aww, Lil’ 
Romeo!’ I was like ‘I can do that!’ So I got mad, and I 
went downstairs and wrote my ?rst verse. And it wasn’t 
as good as Lil’ Romeo’s, but it was my ?rst verse. That 
was the ?rst actual hip-hop verse I remember writing .... 
I was trying to be better than Lil’ Romeo.”
In middle school, Roberts developed an interest in 
producing music, and then joined Art Greenhouse in 
high school, which helped him further develop those 
skills. 
After forming a band called H&T (short for Heroes & 
Terrorists) with a group of friends, Roberts began to 
write his own verses. In his ?rst year of college, he began 
performing with another band he formed with Carnegie 
Mellon students. “I really see myself as a mix of all three 
— writer, producer, performer .... I love every aspect of 
it,” Roberts said.
However, Carnegie Café was not just a debut album 
for Roberts, but a way to explore those interconnected 
passions. He said “I feel it’s not really an album, it’s an 
initiative, and I have to complement it with other ways 
.... other mediums for the message to get out there.”
One medium Roberts is exploring is called “Carnegie 
Café Conversations,” in which Roberts goes to 
various freshmen dorms around campus to facilitate 
conversations and promote awareness of stress and 
mental health disorders. “If I had known what a mental 
health disorder looked like, it would have prevented a 
lot of struggle that I went through in healing myself,” 
Roberts said. 
Roberts is also working on a Kickstarter to make 
Carnegie Café into a visual album — like a short ?lm 
— in which he hopes to work with other Carnegie 
Mellon students. Roberts wants to make Carnegie Café 
a communal experience, in which people of all different 
passions can participate.
As to why Roberts feels that Carnegie Café should be 
more than just an album? “I hate the idea of making 
an album seem like a sel?sh endeavor,” Roberts said. “I 
really want to make this a community endeavor. This 
is for our community. This is Carnegie Mellon’s album. 
That’s why I named it Carnegie Café. It was really 
representative of a lot of our struggles. I just want to get 
people involved.”
Roberts has an upcoming show on March 19 starting 
at 8:15 p.m., at the University of Pittsburgh’s William 
Pitt Union, Northeast Palace. He was invited by Active 
Minds, a mental health awareness club on Pitt’s campus, 
and will lead a short discussion after the show. Carnegie 
Café is also available for free in the University Bookstore.

On Live Guests
This semester on WRCT, live music is better than ever. 
One of our weekly programs, WRCT: A Live Show, has 
been pulling in some quality local acts, from metal to 
bluegrass and indie.
This past Tuesday, we had Joe Materkowski, a singer/
songwriter who did a killer set and answered some of our 
questions on air.
“I’ve listened to music my whole life.... Whenever I was a 
young kid, after dinner my folks would clean up, and go 
watch TV, but set up the record player in the back room for 
me, and I always kind of liked to listen to my dad’s Beatles 
records for an hour a night,” Joe said about his musical 
background after serenading the studio with his original 
song, “Going Home.”
Joe brought a ukulele with him, and played “Lucky Man” 
by Emerson, Lake & Palmer on the tiny four-stringed 
instrument. It was de?nitely the ?rst time Emerson, Lake & 
Palmer has been covered like that at WRCT. Joe and our 
host, B Side, talked about another project, Abacus Jones, 
which Joe plays in with his brother. He referred to the band 
as a “conceptual cover band” that plays shows at casinos, 
parties, and everything in between. 
Recently, Abacus Jones played for over one hundred 
inmates at a maximum security prison in Greene County. 
“It took us a long time to get all of our clearances 
together,” Joe said. “I was working with a few of the 
guards that were helping me out. It was an awesome 
show, though. I was kind of nervous about it, but everyone 
was really perceptive — guards and prisoners alike. We 
tried to mix up the music as much as possible.... Different 
people responded to different songs but there were certain 
songs that everybody really loved.... It was really cool, you 
know, I actually got to talk to a few inmates at the end and 
everyone was really cool.”

Oxymoron spins street narrative
Schoolboy Q releases dark, long-awaited third album
“Hello, my daddy’s a gangsta.”
With these words, spoken from his young daughter’s 
mouth, Schoolboy Q begins “Gangsta,” the savage 
opening track on his long-awaited major label debut 
Oxymoron, a menacing and dark album rife with 
violence, addiction, and moments of good and ?lthy 
fun. In addition to Schoolboy Q’s intense ?rst-person 
narratives, the album boasts a wide stylistic variety 
of beats — including help from such industry 
heavyweights as Mike WiLL Made It and Pharrell 
Williams — and collaborators such as Raekwon, 2 
Chainz, Kendrick Lamar, and Tyler, the Creator.
Oxymoron’s lyrics primarily concern Schoolboy Q’s 
history as an OxyContin dealer, an occupation he 
claims to have held in order to support his daughter 
— hence the album’s title plays on the contradictory 
nature of drug dealing to be a good father — as well 
as his experiences with street violence and drug 
addiction. While these themes are certainly nothing 
new in gangsta rap, Schoolboy Q imbues his raps 
with brash emotional honesty and a ferocity that 
gives them a fresh spin.
“Hoover Street” is the gangbanger origin tale we’ve 
been hearing since gangsta rap’s birth in the ‘90s, 
but delivered with the kind of menace and ?rst-
person immediacy that made The Notorious B.I.G. a 
legend in his own time.
“Prescription/Oxymoron” lays Schoolboy Q’s 
experiences with drug addiction out on the table, 
personifying his demons as a female lover and 
exposing his inner torture through sexual imagery. 
Using a tactic made popular by the original rapping 
dad, Eminem, Schoolboy Q’s daughter makes an 
appearance on the track to accentuate the collateral 
damage of his addiction, but her cries of “Wake up 
Daddy, wake up” give the song a kind of emotional 
bombast that hurts rather than helps.
While Oxymoron’s strengths surely lie in its 
moments of re?ection and honesty, Schoolboy Q 
also knows how to have fun, and the album delivers 
multiple tracks that would ?t well within a DJ set.
The EDM-inspired “Hell of a Night” begins with a 
house-style buildup before ?nally dropping into a 
trap beat for Schoolboy Q’s con?dent and victorious 
verses in which he boasts about living the high life 
and states that he “ain’t minding if the world stops.”
“Collard Greens,” the collaboration with Kendrick 
Lamar that has been blowing up rap blogs since 
last July, ?oats over a spacey and wandering beat 
that allows both wordsmiths to showcase their 
skills. Schoolboy Q bookends the song with simple, 
hypnotic verses, commanding himself to “smoke 
this, drink this, straight to my liver.” 
Kendrick, however, lights the song on ?re with a 
multilingual verse that reinforces why he’s not only 
one of the most technically talented rappers around, 
but also possesses a stylistic ?air that you just can’t 
take your ears off of.
Not all the album’s guests contribute as much as 
Kendrick, though, and one of them marks one of the 
album’s lowest points. “What They Want,” featuring 
2 Chainz, has the kind of “cough syrup” Southern 
rap beat — brought to the party by Mike WiLL Made 
It — that Mr. Chainz has made his name on. Even 
on his home turf, though, his delivery stumbles like 
a man with two broken legs trying to climb up the 
stairs. Perhaps you should put some writers on your 
payroll instead of strippers, Mr. Chainz.
Oxymoron has been one of the most anticipated 
releases in hip-hop for 2014, and with good reason. 
Schoolboy Q’s ?rst two studio albums, Setbacks and 
Habits and Contradictions, released through the 
independent label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), 
both made waves in the rap community. Habits and 
Contradictions even spawned the radio hit “Hands 
on the Wheel,” a song that made it onto every music 
hipster’s “let’s get hammered” playlist.
In addition to his own success, Schoolboy Q is a 
member of the Black Hippy rap collective, which 
counts many of the most forward-thinking artists in 
rap — including Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and Kendrick 
Lamar — among its ranks. Kendrick’s own 2012 
street narrative epic and Grammy-robbed good kid, 
m.A.A.d city prompted Schoolboy Q to state in an 
interview with 2DopeBoyz.com that Kendrick left 
him “no choice but to make a classic album.” 
Well, while Oxymoron may not be the classic 
Schoolboy Q claimed it would be, his career is just 
getting started, and the album’s variety of hard-
hitting beats, coupled with Schoolboy Q’s always 
ferocious delivery, will probably give him the 
exposure he needs to deliver that classic further 
down the road. Until that day comes, Oxymoron will 
do just ?ne for driving around with the windows 
rolled up.

A few years ago, if you asked people where they got 
their fashion inspiration, most would have said fashion 
magazines. As of late, however, many people have 
been replacing magazines — Vanity Fair reported an 11 
percent drop in newsstand sales during 2013, according 
to the Alliance for Audited Media — with websites 
that are more easily accessible and contain the same 
information. These websites come in the form of fashion 
blogs, which are slowly taking over the fashion world. 
While many fashion bloggers who have risen to fame 
started out with the sole intention of sharing style tips 
with the rest of society, many probably had no idea that 
this hobby or career-enrichment project would soon 
grow into a career in itself, with numerous bene?ts and 
opportunities.
Consider Emily Schuman, creator of fashion and lifestyle 
blog Cupcakes and Cashmere. Schuman’s story begins 
during her sophomore year at Scripps College, when 
she made the decision to work in something related to 
publishing, advertising, and fashion. 
Two years later, upon graduation, Schuman began 
working at Teen Vogue and simultaneously started a 
fashion blog to share her interests and likes. Through 
advertisements and collaborations with clothing stores 
such as Juicy Couture, Schuman started earning money 
from her website and reached the point that she is at 
now, where the blog functions as her full-time career. 
She has even written a novel on the same topics as her 
blog, establishing her success in the industry.
Obviously not every story about fashion blogs is this 
successful, and Schuman’s success was also the result 
of a great deal of time and effort. However, it’s a fact that 
online blogs have become a major part of fashion. 
In addition to independent blogs like Cupcakes and 
Cashmere, there are also websites, like Lookbook, that 
allow individuals to post photos of their out?ts online. 
Lookbook is interesting because people can not only 
share their out?ts with each other, but they can also 
like — or “hype,” as it’s called on this website — and 
comment on others’ looks. 
The most bene?cial aspect of Lookbook is the variety. 
Not only do visitors get to see looks from people like 
themselves, but they also get to see out?ts from around 
the world. 
There are countless other fashion blogs from which one 
can gain fashion inspiration. For celebrity style, look 
at Olsens Anonymous, which features the beauty and 
fashion of child stars and current designers Mary-Kate 
and Ashley Olsen. 
Although it may seem like they own the blog, it’s 
actually curated by someone who’s simply a fan of 
their style. Nevertheless, the detailed descriptions 
place it in the top 1 percent of fashion blogs across the 
globe as of fall 2013, according to signature9.com.
Another cool style blog is The College Fashionista. 
It’s tagline is, “Your campus is the runway,” which 
may sound intimidating, this website is quite helpful. 
The looks featured on the website maintain a balance 
between fashion-forward and classroom suitable, which 
is something anyone can strive for. 
Furthermore, the website contains the option to ?lter 
by school, and guess what? Carnegie Mellon’s on there! 
There are also options to ?lter by trend or by category, so 
this blog is really helpful when looking to style a speci?c 
item of clothing.
With so many ideas related to fashion and lifestyle, there 
are hundreds upon thousands of fashion blogs that are 
each unique in some way. There’s even a blog about 
fashion blogging, called Independent Fashion Bloggers, 
which provides helpful tips for starting a blog. 
Whether you want to start your own blog or you’re 
looking for fashion advice, these blogs are sure to get you 
thinking. An endless number of blogs exist, and one will 
always lead to the next, so ?nding them is not an issue. 
You never know; you could be the next Emily Schuman.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for The Americans 
season 2 premiere, “Comrades.”
What’s harder than being the parents of a teenager? 
Being the parents of a teenager while also working 
undercover as a spy for the KGB. That’s what Elizabeth 
Jennings (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew 
Rhys) learned in the season two premiere of FX’s The 
Americans last Wednesday.
When we last left the Jennings, Elizabeth was just 
beginning to recover from a severe gunshot wound and 
had taken the ?rst step toward repairing her increasingly 
real marriage to Philip. Meanwhile, their daughter Paige 
(Holly Taylor) had begun to snoop around the laundry 
room where her parents conduct their secret activities.
Largely focusing on Elizabeth’s return after two months 
of recovery (although her cover story was that she was 
helping a very sick aunt), the episode developed slowly 
before ?nally culminating in one large game-changing 
event.
On the other side of the Cold War, the Jennings’ 
neighbor and FBI Agent Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) 
wasn’t having quite the same luck in his marriage. 
Viewers found him still separated, but relatively happy 
with his mistress/informant Nina Sergeevna (Annet 
Mahendru).
On the whole, the episode did what most premieres 
should: gave the viewer a nice little catch-up about 
what’s going on. That being said, the Jennings family 
trip to the carnival, which quickly morphed into a dead-
drop assignment, really served to push the season in a 
new direction.
The focus on the Jennings as a family in this episode, as 
well as the twist at the end, suggest that this season will 
tackle more of the practical aspects of their life. Elizabeth 
and Philip began to deal with the idea that their children 
are just as involved as they themselves are, even if they 
make serious efforts to keep them out.
Although distinctly more upbeat than previous episodes, 
the premiere contained that nagging sense of history 
that pulls you out of the story, even as the writing and 
acting brings you in. Viewers root for Elizabeth and 
Philip, even knowing about the cause they serve and the 
eventual conclusion to the Cold War.
As the Jennings enjoyed a day at the carnival, you 
might have forgotten the real reason they were there: 
to complete an assignment. The contrast between the 
overly joyful aura at a carnival and the brutal murder 
scene that came at the end served to jerk the viewer out 
of their feeling of total complacence regarding the job 
Philip and Elizabeth do. It was a stark reminder for both 
the audience and the couple that their job is not for the 
faint of heart.
Hopefully, viewers will get to see more con?ict between 
the two lives Elizabeth and Philip lead, instead of the 
fairly productive balancing act we saw last season. Paige 
should be an especially essential character this season, 
as the writers build on her suspicions and explore her 
development as a teenager. The groundwork for that 
storyline is already being laid, and it will be interesting 
to see where the writers take it.
Now that the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi have 
drawn to a close, The Americans has returned to give 
the American public their ?x of Soviet-U. S. con?ict. 
A premiere that alternated between dark and hopeful 
set the stage for this new season, which promises the 
same level of complex story lines, disturbingly relatable 
characters, and phenomenal acting that its freshman run 
gave us.
There’s even a Carnegie Mellon shout-out — a fellow 
English-speaking Soviet spy couple whom the Jennings 
work with has a Carnegie Mellon-bound son. What 
reason is there not to watch?

Last week, the School of Drama presented a production 
of Annie Baker’s The Aliens — which takes its title from 
the Charles Bukowski poem of the same name — in the 
John Wells Video Studio in the Purnell Center for the 
Arts. The play revolves around three young men who 
share loneliness and dissatisfaction with their stagnant 
lives in the lot behind a teashop.
What drives The Aliens isn’t necessarily plot, but instead 
the relationship formed between the shy and fearful 
Evan, played by junior acting major Luke LaMontagne, 
and the two trapped free spirits who hang around in the 
lot behind the teashop where he works: Jasper, played 
by junior acting major Brady Dowad, and KJ, played by 
junior musical theatre major Jean Floradin.
Evan, a boy approaching the end of high school and, 
thus, about to forge his own life, stands in stark contrast 
to Jasper and KJ, who have both found their lives falling 
short of their ambitions. KJ is a former mathematics 
and philosophy major with a penchant for psychedelic 
mushrooms who dropped out of school after suffering a 
nervous breakdown, the effects of which still linger in 
his erratic mind. Jasper is a former trailer-trash orphan 
turned talented aspiring novelist who idolizes Charles 
Bukowski, but is haunted by his past and lacks the 
motivation to push his life forward. The friendship the 
three forge is incredibly real and beautiful, which makes 
it all the more heartbreaking when things come crashing 
down.
The show’s acting, a vital ingredient in such a character-
driven show, was phenomenal. Dowad tapped into 
something within him to bring out the pain in Jasper’s 
tortured character, but knew when to bring forth the 
hopeful energy that marked Jasper’s more effective 
moments. KJ, a dif?cult character who is all over the 
map emotionally and mentally, was well controlled by 
Floradin. In KJ’s moments of psychosis, especially, 
Floradin made the room feel as if it had shrunk by a 
factor of a million. 
The show belonged to LaMontagne, though, who 
not only navigated his way through both the sudden 
shifts between heavy drama and comedy, but perfectly 
exhibited the change in Evan’s character from a meek 
boy allowing himself to be controlled by his surroundings 
to a man determined to live life on his own terms. The 
show’s ?nal scene, involving Evan sloppily playing the 
folk tune “The Hammer Song,” was especially powerful 
in the de?ance of it.
What helped make The Aliens such a memorable 
experience was the immediacy of it. The John Wells 
Video Studio is an incredibly small space, and the 
furthest any audience member could be from the 
performing space was perhaps a yard. This closeness 
removed any sense of detachment from the action and 
allowed you to feel as if you were sitting in the lot right 
with the characters. The show was so intimate that 
one could even hear the pant legs of the actors gently 
rubbing against each other.
Director Cameron Margeson took advantage of the 
play’s less-is-more approach with great success, often 
allowing a simple silence to linger just enough to let it 
speak volumes. The close quarters of the studio certainly 
helped in this achievement. Junior acting major Jeremy 
Hois praised the show’s “beautiful use of silence, which 
often added more to the words than what was simply 
written.”
The set was simple, but said a lot about the space that 
the characters inhabited. A tire full of cigarette butts 
demonstrated the history of the lot and Jasper and 
KJ’s place in it. The barbed wire that topped the fence 
that ran around the perimeter of the room either kept 
intruders out or, perhaps, kept Jasper and KJ trapped 
inside. Gentle, ?ngerpicked guitar melodies hovered over 
the few scene changes, adding to the show’s poignancy.
All in all, The Aliens was a great experience. It may 
not have had the same advantages of the main stage 
productions in the Chosky Theater — namely a big 
budget for elaborate sets and costumes — but that was 
more of a strength than a weakness. The show was what 
good theatre is supposed to be: powerful words spoken 
by talented actors that leave the audience slightly 
different people than they were when the show began. 
To put it simply: It was beautiful.

On Thursday, a sizable group assembled to join 
Princeton University professor of theater Stacy Wolf 
as she whirled through musical theatre history with 
her talk, “Divas, Darlings, and Dames: Women in 
Broadway Musicals of the 1960s.”
According to the introduction by Wendy Arons, an 
associate professor of dramatic literature here at 
Carnegie Mellon University, Wolf works at Princeton 
University as a member of their drama department 
and is also the director of the Princeton Atelier. Wolf 
has published two books, A Problem Like Maria: 
Gender and Sexuality in the American Musical, 
followed by Changed for Good: A Feminist History of 
the Broadway Musical.
The talk was largely inspired by Wolf’s second 
work, which focuses on examining the history of 
Broadway musicals through a feminist lens. By 
focusing on six musicals from the 1960s — Hello, 
Dolly!, Sweet Charity, Cabaret, Oliver!, Mame, and 
Man of La Mancha — Wolf was able to explain how 
crucial gender roles are to Broadway musicals. 
Wolf chose the ’60s because “musicals are always 
in conversation with their historical context,” and 
the historical context of this decade included the 
prevalent social change movements.
Wolf introduced the 1960s as a monumental 
decade of musical theatre history. The mid 1960s 
represented a selection of Broadway musicals which 
exhibit a range of styles, but all focus on a single 
woman and undervalue her strength in some way. 
There are glimpses of women holding power, but the 
overall messages of the musicals are confusing.
Most musicals of the 1950s and ‘60s relied on ?ve 
conventions: they alternated between spoken word 
and singing, their storylines were easy to follow, 
songs were sung from a speci?c character’s point of 
view, there was aesthetic unity among the various 
elements of the production, and a heterosexual love 
story as a narrative force in the story. In the 1960s, 
however, a series of shows premiered that focused 
on the single girl cultural icon.
Portrayed in television shows, movies, and 
advertising, in addition to the musicals, the single 
girl was strong, independent, fearless, and fun. 
Though musicals such as Hello, Dolly!, Sweet 
Charity, Cabaret, Oliver!, Mame, and Man of La 
Mancha possessed characters that exhibited such 
traits in Dolly, Charity, Sally, Nancy, Mame, and 
Aldonza, respectively, the musicals represented 
exactly what was, and still is, wrong with women’s 
roles in Broadway shows.
The roles, Wolf explained, are full of “contradictions 
between what is done and what is said, what is 
sung and what is danced, and what is thought and 
what is felt.” Wolf illustrated that paradoxically, the 
female character is humiliated and objecti?ed even if 
the production is prominently featuring an admired 
actress. “These stories condemn the character while 
celebrating the actor,” Wolf said.
The romantic aspects of these musicals was equally 
confusing: While the female characters engaged 
with males, they end up “alone but optimistic.... The 
heterosexual relationship has failed, but the vibrant 
female body remains,” Wolf said.
In explaining the troubling trends of gender roles 
that were prevalent in the musicals of the 1960s and 
since, Wolf connected her agenda with modern day 
theatre. Musicals that are released on Broadway 
eventually ?lter down into high school and college 
settings. The messages that Broadway musicals 
send will eventually be the ones that young women 
and girls portray on public stages.
“In playing these roles, you’re 100 percent there,” 
Wolf said. “It should be good. You shouldn’t have to 
play a character that’s getting beat up and thrown 
around.” Wolf’s assertion is incredibly relevant and 
thought-provoking, especially at a school such 
as Carnegie Mellon with such a well-known and 
respected drama department that will produce the 
next generation of female Broadway performers.
