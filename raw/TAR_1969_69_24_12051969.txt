Library thefts, disciplinary codes, and activities fees were among 
the topics discussed and acted upon by Student Senate at the meeting 
Tuesday, December 2.
Because of the large number of books taken and never returned to 
the library every year. Joel Goldstein, professor of Psychology, pro­
posed five recommendations to the Faculty Senate in an attempt to get 
back books that have been taken and to prevent future thefts.
These proposals were discussed and passed by Student Senate 
are as follows:
(1)A period of one week be designated as a no-question-asked, no­
penalty free return period during which anyone may return any book 
over-due any length of time without penalty. This should be heavily ad­
vertised in advance; (2) A rigid full-time book inspection check-out 
system must be installed immediately to prevent further losses. Li­
brary patrons should be required to leave only through certain exits and 
have to present all of the books they are carrying for inspection. Purses 
and brief cases must also be inspected. Cries of ‘‘impossible’’ should 
be treated with the following responses: Virtually every major univer­
sity library in the United States has already such a system. Where in­
stituted it is reported that book losses drop to almost zero. Note that 
the system must be in operation at all times the library is in operation. 
Note also that a casual glance or wave-em-through procedure is not ac­
ceptable; an actual inspection must be carried out; (3) The availability 
of Xerox machines in the library should be advertised) (4) Professors 
should be urged to put adequate numbers of required books on reserve) 
(5) Further suggestions for improving service and for recovering loss­
es should be solicited from both students and faculty.
These recommendations will now be put on the agenda of the Plan­
ning Council where it will be decided if they are to put into effect.
A motion was passed (31-0-3) recommending that $15 of tuition per 
full time day student per semester be allocated to the student activities 
budget for the year 1970-71. This shall apply to students, graduates as 
well as undergraduates.
Several announcements were made at the meeting. Scott Miller re­
ported that as of now the proposed faculty center will not be built. The 
money will be placed into a fund for later use.
President Joe Duckworth announced that Michael Armentrout has 
resigned as Director of Academic Affairs, effective in approximately 
one month.
Patrick Cavanagh reported that the Conference Committee on Cam­
pus Codes met Tuesday and discussed what is probably the final form 
of judicial proceedings: there will be three separate discipline bodies, 
each operating independently and only dealing with its constituents. 
Eacji court or constituency will have a bill of rights and a body of pro­
hibitive regulations. This action will require the ratification of the en­
tire campus.
A motion that Student Senate elections be held six to eight weeks 
before the end of classes was tabled to the rules committee.
In addition, it was reported that at the meeting of the Educational 
Policy Council last Monday the motion to list professors’ names with 
course and section number was approved. The motion to drop the gym 
requirement effective with the class of 1970 was tabled until the conse­
quences of the action could be fully investigated.
Effects of Draft Lottery on College Students
Question—How will the lottery affect those, such as 
college students who have draft deferments?
Answer—If they were born between January 1. 1944. 
and December 31. 1950. they will receive a lottery number 
in the first drawing.
Men who are deferred will retain their lottery 
numbers permanently and will be subject to call over a 12- 
month period when their deferments expire. If their draft 
board have already passed their lottery numbers at that 
time, they will be drafted ahead of all others on the list.
Selective Service statistics show that about 1.6 million 
draft-eligible college men have student deferments.
It is not known how many of these students will be 
graduating next June, but the Pentagon estimates that 
about 350.000 in the 1970 pool will have lost deferments. 
One otficial says that ' most” of the men in that category 
are now college students.
Nevertheless, it is a fair assumption that by the start 
ot the 197071 academic year, a substantial number of 
eligible college graduates will not yet have been drafted 
under the lottery may therefore be able to start at least 
their first year of graduate study.
Q.—What will happen to Reserve Officers Training 
Programs once the lottery has begun?
A.—The number of college students who sign up for 
ROTC is expected to decline. Says one official connected 
with a presidential commission on an all-volunteer armed 
force: Once the 19-year-olds know where they are in the
order of call, and if they are home free, there is going to be 
no pressure on them to join the reserves or the ROTC.
Q.—Will the lottery make it possible for graduate 
students whose inductions has been postponed to escape 
the draft?
A —No. These men will be inducted at the end of the 
semester or the academic year, as they would have been 
without-the lottery.
There reportedly has been some confusion, however, 
over the meaning of a recent presidential announcement 
relating to graduate students who are called for service 
during the year.
Deferments for graduate students in all but a few 
fields were ended in February. 1968. Until two months ago, 
those satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of study 
could have their induction delayed to the end of the 
semester.
On October 1. the President announced a new National 
Security Council memorandum that permits extending the

postponements in such cases through the entire academic 
year. Students who have not been granted this further 
delay may still face prompt induction unless they request 
the extra time from their state selective service director.
Q.—What about graduate students in the prime age 
group who have not been called for induction?
A —They will take their place in the lottery sequence 
like everybody else. If they do get called, they can request 
postponement of induction until the end of the academic 
year.
Q.—How will graduate school enrollments in general 
be affected?
A.—The U.S. Office of Education estimates that close 
to 800,00 full-time and part-time students are enrolled in 
graduate schools this year.
According to past surveys, roughly half of all graduate 
students have been eligible for the draft, although in 
practice not all of them have been taken while they were 
still in school.
Some graduate students, for example, have received 
occupational deferments from their local boards because 
of teaching or research responsibilities.
Under the lottery, less than half of the draft-eligible 
graduate students—are likely to be called next year.
Q.—Does this mean that those with occupational 
deferments who reach age 26 without being called will no 
longer be vulnerable?
A.—Probably so, although technically they will 
^ remain subject to the draft until age 35

TTERS TO THE EDITOR
Love, Not Contraceptives, Is Solution To Life
Editor. The Tartan:
In response to your editorial. 
"Be Aware of the Pill,” I agree 
that too many unwanted pregnan­
cies result from ignorance — not 
of contraceptive measures but 
about the true meaning of love.
In my opinion, love by sexual 
expression was meant to be an 
eternal experience between one 
man and one woman through mar­
riage. To quote the Bible, “And a 
man shall leave his father and his 
mother and cleave unto his wife 
and the two shall becone one.” No­
tice that the marriage cremony 
of leaving parents and taking 
spouse precedes intercourse.
Love, in other words, requires 
a total commitment, in sickness 
and in health, in sorrow and in 
joy, until separation at death.
Bio. Weapons
Editor. The Tartan:
It is a great testimonial to the 
power of the printed word and to 
the influence of your fine publica­
tion that just four days after the 
appearance of my column on bio­
logical warfare. President Nixon 
announced a freeze on the produc­
tion of biological agents and the 
destruction of existing stockpiles, 
pledging that the U.S. would nev­
er use biological weapons.
Perhaps the Senate will com­
plement the President’s action by 
ratifying the 1925 Geneva Conven­
tion banning the use of gas in com- 
3at. Its never too late (almost».
Steve Jurman
These guidelines weren't formu­
lated to make man celebant but 
rather to prevent the psychologi­
cal and physiological damage done 
to adulterers and fornicators 
through extra-martial intercourse. 
I suggest that education in this 
area will cure the problem. The 
pill and the necessary supportive
programs merely treat the symp­
toms.
I realize this opinion may be 
deemed worthless and irrelevant 
in our ‘modern” society. It’s sali­
ent virtue is that it didn’t cost $3.
John J. Beres 
Graduate Student 
Dept, of Chemistry
Science and Society Seminar
Editor, The Tartan:
In the world today science and 
technology have great effects on 
our lives and on man’s future, 
however, there is little in the edu­
cation of the engineer and scien­
tist at C-MU that reflects this. In­
deed it seems that a CIT student 
can advance from freshman to 
Ph.D. without ever engaging in 
serious discussion with faculty 
members on ethical, political, cul­
tural, or historical implications 
of science and technology.
As one step in dealing with these 
problems, I am offering next se­
mester a Seminar on Science and 
Society (39-706) for graduate st- 
dents and advanced CIT under­
graduate students. I hope in this 
course that we may study and dis­
cuss together the role of the sci­
entist and engineer in the deci­
sions that are made as to the uses 
and misuses of science and tech­
nology. The particular topics to 
be stressed this spring will de­
pend upon the interests of the stu­
dents. Interested students are in­
vited to see me to ask questions
or offer suggestions.

Isn't the Lottery Fun? Now Exempt 1 to 366
To The Tartan:
In the Dec. 2 issue of the Tartan, 
the editorial "applauded” the lot­
tery as a needed reform and sug­
gested a few other draft reforms. 
Although I agree the reforms sug­
gested would bring some (how­
ever small) improvement. I think 
all of them are unrealistic. I would 
like to present one of a few possi­
ble realistic proposals for the 
draft.
I propose:
1. That the lottery be kept be­
cause it’s so much fun and is a 
good way to find out when people's 
birthdays are.
2. That everyone from numbers 
one to 386. inclusive, not be draft-
ed and that anyone above 366 or 
less than or equal to zero be eligi­
ble.
3. That all people who volunteer 
be sent to some deserted island 
out in the Pacific Ocean with vol­
unteers from all the other coun­
tries around the world.
4. That all sorts of war games 
be set up with a provision that no 
weapons more dangerous than a 
water gun be used. (United Na­
tion’s observers can be sent to in­
sure that this regulation is fol­
lowed. )
5. That President Nixon appoint 
a committee to investigate the 
question of whether the one hun­
dred billion dollars (about $1,500
per family) annually from taxes 
and spent for military purposes 
could be spent in a more woth- 
while way.

It Ain’t Necessarily So
Friday, December , 1969—THE TART AN—Page 3
by Steve Jurman
I begin with an invitation. Any­
one with some special interest or 
something to say that falls in with 
the stated purposes of this column 
is welcome to prepare a column 
and send it in to me. It will appear 
in this spot under the author’s 
name.
It’s been two weeks since Wash­
ington, and I’m often asked now, 
what good was it? What was prov­
en? What was accomplished?
Obviously the war continues. 
Just last night a showy (to my 
mind, obscene) production was 
made of assigning young Ameri­
cans to their fates. Of what value 
was Washington?
My opinion is that the value was 
in the spectacle put on by the gov­
ernment to discredit and discour­
age our efforts. With unprece­
dented clarity the government dis­
played its real self—not a respon­
sible agent of the people, their 
benefactor and preserver, not our 
servant, existing to do our will, 
but an arrogant, independent en­
tity, serving only its own inter­
ests.
Prior to Nov. 15 the govern­
ment attempted in every way pos­
sible to undercut the Peace Move­
ment’s position and to coerce peo­
ple not to express their opinion, 
not to come and dissent.
The old fashioned smear was 
not too low to stoop to. Transpor­
tation Secretary John Volpe 
checked under his bed and discov­
ered that the whole movement 
was Communist or Communist in­
spired. Vice President Agnew s 
discovery of the Thesaurus is past 
knowledge to all.
More insidious were the efforts 
at coercion. The Vice President’s 
threats against the television net­
works and large newspapers were 
so thinly veiled as to be obvious. 
(It is also obvious that the news 
is and must by human nature be 
slanted. But it is obvious that the 
slant is toward the government.)
The Justice Department, in its 
week long refusal to grant a per­
mit, and in its highly publicized 
troop allerts, played up the issue 
of violence as much as it could in 
an attempt to discredit the March 
and the New Mobilization Com­
mittee and to scare off prospec­
tive marchers. (The final insane 
result of the permit hassle was a 
march limited to half the lanes of 
Pennsylvania Ave. while the other 
half remained empty, closed to 
traffic.) -
Reports are many of bus com-
lor cours
by
Chagall,
Baskin,
Rouault,
Daumier
& n\any
others
panies that cancelled their char­
ters under pressure, such as FBI 
threats of prosecution for cross­
ing state lines to riot or threats 
of difficulties in license and route 
renewals.
The Army made itself obvious 
in several ways. Troops who plan­
ned to go to Washington often 
found themselves suddenly re­
stricted to their bases. Grim 
countenanced troops were evident 
in many government buildings, 
while a convoy of military police 
slowly drove up and down the 
clear portion of Pennsylvania Ave.
I wonder still as to the purpose of 
the Army helicopters that con­
tinually buzzed Arlington during 
the March Against Death, as well 
as all the Saturday events.
Not even the most childish and 
petty tricks were ignored. The 
large floodlights that normally il­
luminate the White House were 
turned around so as to be in the 
eyes of the Marchers Against 
Death as they passed the White 
House. Dignity?
President Nixon, the represen­
tative of all the people of Ameri­
ca. arrogantly announced that he 
would spend Saturday watching 
the Purdue-Ohio State football 
game on television. It was no con­
cern to him that across the coun­
try over a million people were 
demonstrating their opinion 
against his policies.
The day after the March saw 
Attorney General Mitchell state 
that the March could not be char­
acterized as peaceful. The state­
ment was a lie. a deliberate deceit 
as evidenced by the figures (150 
arrests in a group of over 500-000) 
and the statements of other gov­
ernment officials, including the 
White House press secretary.
The worst violence of the day 
was the unjustified and indiscrim­
inate tear gassing of the whole 
Mall assembly area by the Wash­
ington police. The attack was en­
tirely unprovoked and unneces­
sary. It was also incompetent. Too 
much gas was used and a large 
segment of Washington found it­
self gassed (including, reported­
ly. Mitchell).
Now the Administration is ex­
panding its policy of coercion and 
repression. Added to Agnews 
threats to the media and his state­
ments intimating "authoritarian 
society” and the separation of 
certain elements from society 
like "rotten apples from a barrel.” 
the Justice Department announc­
ed an investigation of the New
Carnegie-Mellon University 
FACULTY LOUNGE 
MONDAY, DECEMBER 8th 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Mobilization Committee for pos­
sible conspiracy to incite riot. One 
must wonder how far these inves­
tigations will reach.
The story of Washington is a 
story of government smears, coer­
cion and repression. It is the story 
of an Administration following the 
wishes of majority evidenced by 
50.000 letters and telegrams of 
support, and arrogantly ignoring 
the opinion of the minority, rep­
resented by a million warm, live 
bodies. It increasingly appears 
that "this government of the peo­
ple, by the people, and for the peo­
ple" has indeed perished from this 
earth.

The letter preceeding the list of names reads:
Dear Mr. Mitchell,
We of the New Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam wish to 
identify and shre in the New Mobe statement of Nov. 19 regarding con­
spiracy and violence in Washington Nov. 13-14,1969.
This statement reads as follows :
We of the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam 
have had a modest part in making it possible for more than half a mil­
lion Americans to express peacefully.soberly and with joy their de­
termination that the United States should withdraw from Vietnam, 
abandon its policies of military agression and replace them with poli­
cies of peace.
In the process, we have met together, planned together, worked to­
gether. We have crossed many state lines and we have talked with many 
people.
We deny that we have disturbed the peace. We declare that we 
have disturbed the war. We deny that we have conspired to do violence. 
We declare that we have conspired—literally breathed together—to en­
gage in a peaceful protest against U.S. agression in Vietnam. We deny 
that we shall be bullied or threatened into silence by the Nixon Adminis­
tration. We declare that we shall continue to speak out for peace, to 
work together for peace, and to draw strength from the millions of 
Americans who now. with us. oppose the atrocious war in Vietnam.
If this be conspiracy, let the Justice Department make the most of 
it. It is a conspiracy for decency and a restored America. For our part, 
we shall continue our peaceful and legal efforts to bring the violence 
and the crimes of the U.S. agression in Vietnam to an end.
We say. "Give Peace a Chance! ”
Yours for Peace in Vietnam

DOUGLAS WILSON
PAINTINGS
Woodstock”--Sounds and People
The production office rarely had 
had to spell out the address—the 
sounds could be heard five blocks 
away — and the finished feature 
film came together under the cri­
tical eye and enthusiastic encour­
agement of a constant stream of 
visitors ranging from the Who and 
festival promoter Mike Lang to 
Joe Cocker and Country Joe and 
the Fish.
Wadleigh’s associate and the 
film’s producer is Bob Maurice, a 
gangling CCNY graduate, who is 
undoubtedly the first producer in 
major motion picture ranks with 
an electric-shock hairdo that could 
outshine Tiny Tim.
Together, Wadleigh and Maur­
ice put together the preparations, 
equipment and immense under- 
30 technical crew that covered the 
Music and Art Fair. The achieve­
ment was not a minor one. By the 
time the first long-haired children 
of the love generation appeared on 
the horizon above Bethel, N. Y., 
the “Woodstock” film crew were 
already in place on the actual site, 
Wadleigh supervising a team of 29 
cameramen and backed by a vir­
tual film-maker’s army that in­
cluded eight camera assistants, 
six documentary sound men, 14 
performance sound engineers and 
synchronization specialists, six 
still men and 30 production assis­
tants.
On screen, Warner Bros. 
“Woodstock” is two hours of good 
vibrations and incredible sounds, 
the essence of that memorable 
weekend without the discomfort 
of weather or unscheduled sleep­
ing arrangements.
Since last summer’s Music and 
Art Fair burst on an unsuspecting 
nation, “Woodstock” has passed
into the .language of the current 
college generation.
For those of us who were there, 
it has become both a password 
and a symbol. It is also a memory 
of taking part in that incredible 
mass of music, surrounded by
400,000 of the friendliest, most 
peace-loving people on the face of 
the earth. A happy, joyous, musi­
cal, muddy weekend when the out­
side world thought we were hav­
ing a disaster, and we knew that 
we were having no such thing.
Now it has reached the screen.
Warner Bros, will soon be releas­
ing ‘Woodstock.” a full-length 
color feature film directed by 
Michael Wadleigh, a 25 year old 
graduate of Columbia Medical 
School and NYU. and possibly the 
top-ranking cinematographer to 
be tuned into the specialized wave­
length of today's rock music and 
folk scenes.
Wadleigh is a far cry from the 
usual product of the Hollywood 
assembly line. A gaunt, intense 
character with straight, shoulder- 
length hair and an invariable
wardrobe of faded levis. bare, 
chest and ten-inch-high Navajo 
hat. he has spent his days for the 
last two months in a vast. Kaf- 
kaesque working loft above a run­
down block off Broadway in New 
York, surrounded by thousands of 
feet of “Woodstock” footage.
The performers include such 
folk singers as Arlo Guthrie. Joan 
Baez. Johnny Winter and Richie 
Havens. Then Janis Joplin, the 
Who. Sly and the Family Stone, 
and Jimi Hendrix giving forth 
with the most improbable version
of the Star Spangled Banner ever 
heard.
Among the rock groups are Can­
ned Heat, the Creedence Clearwa­
ter Revival. Santana. Mountain. 
The Band are there too. out on 
their own now without Bob Dylan. 
And Joe Cocker. Ten Years After. 
Crosby. Stills. Nash and Young, 
and Paul Butterfield Blues Band. 
Sha-Na-Na and Country Joe and 
the Fish.
Not forgetting the crowd, half 
a million youngsters high on mu­
sic and bivouacked on grassy 
knolls, in cemeteries and on mar­
gins of mosquito-infested marsh­
es like some splendid, extravan- 
gantly garbed, joyful meeting of 
the clans.
The talent line-up is outstand­
ing. with the music building in in­
tensity and excellence in spite of 
rain, and mud. electronic failures, 
even missing equipment. Each 
group plays hard and well, ob­
viously grooving on the outstand­
ing peace and joy of the youthful 
audience, and the result that is 
captured on film makes Warner 
Bros.’ ’Woodstock” one of the 
all-time great shows in rock mu­
sic screen history.
Finally, and perhaps most im­
portant of all. the current feature 
film is an Aquarian Age land­
mark. “Woodstock” is a cinema­
tographic celebration to the new 
culture of peace, love, music and 
your own thing. For the first time, 
the young performers, and their 
off-beat audience, are seen from 
the unexpected and refreshing 
viewpoint of their own generation. 
It is so obviously right that one 
suddenly wonders why it has nev­
er been done before.

How Great Is Man?
Was it man who made all 
We are enjoying today?
Does man have the power 
To create an-other
When a man is not satisfied
* With being in this life
Does he have enough power 
To rule out the darkness of nights
Will man ever create 
A new sun to shine 
To send greater light 
For happiness to find?
Is man so great 
He can control the weather 
The way he wants to 
% To make his life better?
Will man ever have power 
To bring all men peace 
Give others a true hope 
For their questions to cease?
Was it man in the beginning 
Who layout his plan 
To create a God 
That now he can’t stand?
Can man plan a love 
To satisfy all others?
To start this world living 
As sisters and brothers?
Will man have the power 
To give me a peace of mind 
Does he have greater power 
To create his own kind.
Just how great is man 
Should he continue in his way 
With such uncertainly we see. 
From Day to Day?
Maybe there is a God 
Man can return to 
Follow in his way 
To bring him through?

Testimony May Bring 
Incrimination of Self
In light of the fact that disci­
plinary codes are currently being 
studied at C-MU, the following 
case is interesting. The case indi­
cates that by testifying at a col­
lege disciplinary hearing, students 
face the possibility of incriminat­
ing themselves at later criminal 
proceedings involving the same 
action.
A court in California has held 
that a college disciplinary hearing 
for students who are facing crim­
inal charges for the same actions 
does not violate the self-incrimin­
ation provision of the Fifth 
Admentment of the Constitution.
The case involved five students 
at the College of San Mateo in Cali­
fornia who were charged by the 
college with having violated cam­
pus regulations during one or 
more demonstrations.
The students were suspended, 
pending a hearing.
Thereafter, based upon the ac­
tions, criminal charges were 
brought against them ina state 
court. They petitioned a federal 
district court for an injunction to 
compel the college to reinstate 
them, pending the disposition of 
the criminal charges.
The students argued that if they 
were given a prompt hearing by 
the college, their testimony there 
could be used against them in the 
subsequent trial, and thus they 
would be denied protection 
against self-incrimination under 
the Fifth Amendment.

The court, in rejecting the stu­
dents’ contention, cited a recent 
decision of the Supreme Court 
(Garrety v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 
493. 1967) in which it was held 
that statements made at an ad­
ministrative hearing similar, to a 
college disciplinary hearing are 
not admissable as evidence at a 
subsequent criminal proceeding 
(Furutani v. Ewigleben. 297 F 
Supp. 1969).

Unfair Representation On Draft Boards
Nationally, disproportionate 
numbers of blacks and poor are 
inducted through the Selective 
Service System. When this is jus­
tified, or however it is deplored, 
it is pointed out that the Selective 
Service Service is primarily a lo­
cal mechanism, operated by re­
spected and respresentative mem­
bers of the very community out of 
which registrants are taken. So 
the Selective Service Law states. 
It is, however, jst not the case. 
On at least two local boards, cov­
ering two of the predominately 
black areas of the city, no such 
representation exists.
Specifically, Selective Service 
Regulations 1604.52c states: “The
members of local boards shall be 
citizens of the United States who 
shall be residents of a country in 
which their local board has juris­
diction and who shall also, if at all 
practicable, Oa ,aervanBe lG BPa 
E,aE rn wPrHP BPar, ilHEi OlE,v 
PEe jR,revrHBrlnL”
In Pittsburgh, however, 42 per 
cent of the membership of local 
boards in fact do nlB reside in the 
area they serve. On two of the 
boards, numbers 15 and 18, none 
of the members live in BPar, area 
at all. So much for local represen­
tation. As might be expected, 
“disproportionate” representa­
tion exists in the poorer and 
blacker neighborhoods. Local
Board 18 serves city wards 12 and
13, essentially the Homewood- 
Brushton area. Local Board 15 
covers city wards 2, 23, 24, and 
25, basically the lower North Side 
and the Butler St./Strip area.

All local boards refused to 
identify members other than by 
name. Although Gen. Hershey has 
regretably referred to these boards
as “little groups of neighbors.” 
The names and addresses of these 
men were made public by the 
Pittsburgh Draft Resistance, 3406 
Fifth Ave., Room 304. In so doing, 
they asked that persons contact 
these men and determine for them­
selves how representative the 
board members are of the com­
munity. In releasing this informa­
tion, Pittsburgh Draft Resistance 
also suggested that these board 
members be told of “the illegality 
of the war and the draft,” and that 
they be asked “to disavow the Se­
lective Service System and to re­
sign.
Although the new lottery sys­
tem takes much of the local
draft board’s authority away by 
removing their former power 
to decide who goes and when, 
they still retain an important 
function. The local boards still 
decide who is to be awarded
