Carnegie Mellon issued an 
update to the preferred name 
guidelines for students this 
fall.
The changes were an-
nounced in an email sent by 
Dean of Student Affairs Gina 
Casalegno last Monday. Ac-
cording to the email, student-
speci?ed preferred names 
have been used in all Black-
board courses since the sum-
mer semester. The message 
said that preferred names 
have now also been added 
to Health Services records, 
course photo rosters, and resi-
dential rosters.
Records for University 
Health Services, Counseling 
and Psychological Services, 
and housefellows and resi-
dential administrative staff 
will now contain students’ 
preferred names as well as 
their legal ones. Photo rosters 
will contain students’ pre-
ferred names instead of their 
legal ones.
Any student who wants to 
set a preferred name needs to 
log in to Student Information 
Online (SIO) and select the 
preferred ?rst name option 
under “View and Update My 
Info.”
In order to avoid any tech-
nical issues implementing the 
name policy, Casalegno said 
that working groups spent a 
large amount of time coding 
in order to “build the right 
infrastructure, which is part 
of what took us so long” in 
rolling out the new preferred 
name policy.
Junior global studies and 
Chinese studies double major 
Colin Meret, the president of 
ALLIES, an LBGTQ group on 
campus, said that preferred 
names are often of particular 
concern to transgender stu-
dents.
“De?nitely it’s a step in the 
right direction,” Meret said of 
the new guidelines. “Obvious-
ly, transgender students face 
many challenges in college.”
Meret recalled the steps 
his predecessors took to en-
courage these changes, say-
ing, “ALLIES was one of the 
organizations helping push 
this policy.”
Casalegno said that AL-
LIES brought forth the initial 
proposal for preferred name 
guidelines several years ago. 
After becoming dean of Stu-
dent Affairs, Casalegno took 
up the issue. She said she 
worked for two years to de-
velop the policy.
Meg Evans, ALLIES’ coor-
dinator of LGBTQ resources 
and the Stever House house-
fellow, was involved in the 
working groups that led to the 
changes. 
She spoke of the residen-
tial bene?ts of this new pol-
icy, such as RAs receiving a 
student’s preferred name for 
door decorations and other 
purposes before the student 
even arrives.
Evans also emphasized the 
role of awareness and educa-
tion in achieving greater tol-
erance and understanding of 
the transgender community. 
“It’s a step,” Evans said. “But 
it won’t change the hearts and 
minds of people.”
In addition to the LBGTQ 
community, these changes in 
policy may also be pertinent 
to international students, 
who often go by a name that 
is not their legal name, or stu-
dents who for other reasons 
prefer to be addressed by an 
alternate name.
The changes to the pre-
ferred name guidelines have 
been welcomed by many stu-
dents.
“I feel a preferred name 
policy is great because it al-
lows students to feel most 
comfortable on campus, even 
in an academic setting,” said 
Angelique Rein, a sophomore 
business and Japanese double 
major. “It addresses an issue 
that doesn’t even cross most 
people’s minds. It’s a step to-
wards greater acceptance and 
freedom of identity for all stu-
dents.”
Junior information sys-
tems and human-computer 
interaction major Shreepal 
Shah was in favor of the 
changes. 
Shah, a TA for 73–100 
Principles of Economics, 
said, “I could only imagine it 
helping, primarily because it 
avoids discrepancies between 
how you would interact with 
a student in class and keeping 
track of their grades on an of-
?cial roster. The more consis-
tency, the better.”

The Port Authority an-
nounced last Tuesday that the 
service reduction planned for 
Sept. 2 would be postponed 
until at least August 2013.
The postponement is the 
result of a deal reached by 
the Port Authority, Allegh-
eny County, Governor Tom 
Corbett’s of?ce, and the Lo-
cal 85 Amalgamated Transit 
Union. Under the deal, Port 
Authority employees in the 
Local 85 union will undergo 
a two-year pay freeze and 
increase the percentage of 
the paychecks paid into their 
pension plans; the state will 
provide $35 million to Port 
Authority during the coming 
year; and Allegheny County 
will provide $4.5 million over 
the coming year.
The turning point in ne-
gotiations, which have been 
ongoing for several months, 
was the rati?cation of a new 
contract between the Port 
Authority and the Local 85, 
to which the majority of the 
Port Authority’s employees 
belong.
“Once the contract was 
rati?ed, we knew that we 
would be seeing some pretty 
substantial savings from that 
contract,” Port Authority 
spokesperson Heather Pharo 
said. “As we have been in dis-
cussions with the state and 
the county as well, the board 
opted to postpone the cuts for 
at least one year ... in order to 
give the state and the county 
more time to ?gure out a 
sustainable plan for funding 
transportation.”
Local 85 President Ste-
phen Palonis said that al-
though the union is not en-
tirely happy with the new 
contract, something had to 
be done in order to save local 
transportation.
“It’s a concessionary con-
tract, that’s for sure,” Palonis 
said. “Our membership says 
we have to do our part for 
transportation in Allegheny 
County. They have faith in 
us.”
Palonis said that there 
are some caveats in the new 
contract. “If the governor 
doesn’t come through with a 
dedicated source of funding 
that can grow, we revert back 
to our previous contract. Our 
membership rati?ed it by a 
10-to-one margin, and the 
reason they rati?ed it by that 
margin was because of that 
language.”
Palonis pointed to Allegh-
eny County Executive Rich 
Fitzgerald as another pivotal 
player in the agreement.
“He really kept our nose 
to the grindstone throughout 
this process,” Palonis said. 
“Rich is an advocate for trans-
portation. I’ve dealt with a lot 
of politicians through this 
process, but Rich really wants 
to see transportation grow.”
According to the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette, Fitzger-
ald is advocating paying the 
county’s portion of the agree-
ment using two sources: the 
county’s drink tax and the Al-
legheny Regional Asset Dis-
trict (RAD). The RAD draws 
its revenue from a 1 percent 
addition to Pennsylvania’s 6 
percent sales tax.
Carnegie Mellon Student 
Body President Will Weiner,  
a senior economics and sta-
tistics and decision science 
double major who lobbied 
for local transportation in his 
previous role as chair of the 
Undergraduate Student Sen-
ate, is happy about the deal.
“The bene?ts are pretty 
obvious, especially for our 
graduate student popula-
tion,” Weiner said. “I’m re-
ally glad the deal was worked 
out, because they utilize a lot 
of the routes that were going 
to be cut.”
Since one of Corbett’s ma-
jor demands was union con-
cessions, Weiner said the new 
union contract gives trans-
portation lobbyists more bar-
gaining power in the future. 
“I think it gives our side some 
more ammunition to say, 
‘Look, they’ve made some 
concessions,’ ” Weiner said. 
“So it gives us a better posi-
tion to secure a better future 
not just for Pittsburgh, but for 
the state.”
Weiner said that student 
government’s future lobby-
ing efforts, whatever they 
are, will probably be made 
through the Pittsburgh Stu-
dent Government Council.
“It could manifest itself a 
lot of ways. I want to use our 
resources and connections 
with local government before 
?guring out what the next 
step is,” he said.

The FBI of?cially in-
dicted Adam Stuart Busby 
on Aug. 22 for sending over 
40 threatening emails to the 
University of Pittsburgh last 
year. Busby’s emails were 
part of a series of over 100 
bomb threats issued to Pitt 
throughout the spring se-
mester. Busby, the founder 
of the Scottish National Lib-
eration Army, is currently 
in an Irish prison awaiting 
an extradition hearing for 
threats he allegedly made 
about airliners travelling 
between London and New 
York City.
According to a statement 
on the FBI’s website, Busby 
is indicted on 35 counts: 
17 counts of wire fraud, 16 
counts of maliciously con-
veying false information in 
the form of bomb threats, 
and two counts of interna-
tional extortion.
In addition to the Pitt 
bomb threats, Busby has 
been charged with sending 
emails in 2010 threatening 
to poison water supplies in 
England, and speci?cally 
Gordon Brown, who was 
prime minister of the Unit-
ed Kingdom at the time. 
The 64-year-old Scottish 
nationalist is known mainly 
for his hoaxes; while the 
Scottish National Libera-
tion Army has carried out 
or attempted more overt 
acts of terrorism in the past, 
Busby suffers from multiple 
sclerosis and is bound to a 
wheelchair.
“I was not in the least bit 
surprised [by the charges],” 
David Leslie, a retired Scot-
tish reporter who person-
ally knows Busby, said in a 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette arti-
cle. “His motive is publicity. 
Busby glories in publicity. 
He will target anyone or any 
organization that he feels 
will gain him publicity.”
Busby’s motive is 
unclear. The FBI declined 
to speculate about his 
reasoning, and Busby has no 
direct connection to either 
the university or the city. 
In his interview, Leslie told 
the Post-Gazette that it was 
likely not a deeply thought-
out action, and was possibly 
inspired by the presence of 
a UPMC hospital in Dublin.
While the threats Busby 
has been charged with were 
some of the most prominent 
of those made against Pitt, 
nobody has been charged 
for the other threats, in-
cluding the initial ones 
written inside bathrooms 
on campus. Pitt rescinded 
its offer of a $50,000 re-
ward for information after 
a group calling itself the 
“Threateners,” now identi-
?ed as Busby, claimed re-
sponsibility for some of the 
threats and demanded that 
the reward be removed.
Extradition from Ireland 
is historically hard to ac-
complish, and authorities 
in both the U.S. and the 
U.K. seem to view Busby as 
a nuisance more than any-
thing, according to Leslie’s 
interview with the Post-Ga-
zette. The FBI did not make 
any statements regarding 
extradition. Leslie believes 
that the U.S. will likely not 
push hard for Busby’s extra-
dition.

Students looking to study 
on the ?rst ?oor of Hunt Li-
brary this semester may run 
into trouble. The area is being 
renovated to make space for a 
tutoring station, among other 
additions.
“I’m very excited,” said 
Gloriana St. Clair, dean of 
University Libraries. “These 
[renovations] are some things 
that we’ve been wanting to 
get done for students for quite 
a long time.”
In addition to the tutoring 
station, formally known as the 
Global Communications Cen-
ter (GCC), St. Clair said that 
the renovations will include a 
consultation room, a meeting 
room, more tables and chairs 
by the back windows, and an 
interactive lounge with a ?at 
screen TV.
According to St. Clair, all 
of the renovations were re-
quested or proposed by the 
Student Advisory Board, with 
which Hunt Library staff has 
been consulting over the past 
year.
The renovations are be-
ing made with next year’s 
Middle State Accreditation 
Agency (MSAA) visit in mind. 
The MSAA is an independent 
agency that offers accredita-
tion, or credibility, to institu-
tions of higher education. 
Outside of the U.S., uni-
versity accreditation is usual-
ly performed by a government 
organization. In the U.S., it is 
done by private membership 
associations. According to 
St. Clair, the MSAA “peer re-
views” universities every ?ve 
years or sooner depending on 
how they score and improve.
In its last visit to Carn-
egie Mellon, St. Clair said 
the MSAA suggested that the 
university focus on “student 
learning outcomes.”
“When we were reviewed 
by the Middle States Accred-
iting Agency, they gave us a 
very positive review, but they 
did make a suggestion to us 
that it would be nice if we 
were able to tackle this prob-

Corrections & Clari?cations
The article “Where to eat: Pittsburgh’s best bites” 
(Pillbox, Aug. 20, 2012) incorrectly stated that Tazza 
d’Oro is on the fourth ?oor of the Gates Center. It is on 
the third ?oor.
If you would like to submit a correction or clari?ca-
tion, please email The Tartan at news@thetartan.org or

print the correction or clari?cation in the next print is-
sue and publish it online.
The Carnegie Mellon 
Philharmonic will debut an 
original work on Sept. 16. 
The work, Centennial Suite, 
was jointly written by mu-
sic composition professors 
Leonardo Balada, Nancy Gal-
braith, Marilyn Taft Thomas, 
and Reza Vali in honor of the 
School of Music’s 100th anni-
versary.
“On the occasion of its 
centennial it’s certainly ap-
propriate to look back over 
the rich history of the CMU 
School of Music, but so is a 
look forward,” said Denis 
Colwell, head of the School 
of Music, in a university press 
release. “I thought one way 
of celebrating where we have 
arrived and, more important, 
where we are going, is to 
cause new music to be cre-
ated.”
Each movement of the 
suite was written by a differ-
ent professor. The ?rst, “Cel-
ebration,” was composed by 
Thomas; the second, “Memo-
ries No. 1, Barcelona 1938,” 
was composed by Balada; the 
third, “Euphonic Blues,” was 
composed by Galbraith; and 
the ?nal movement, “The 
Darkness of Fury,” was com-
posed by Vali.
The concert will be held at 
7:30 p.m. in Carnegie Music 
Hall. General admission tick-
ets for the concert are $5.

Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology’s Technology 
Review has named human-
computer interaction Ph.D. 
student Chris Harrison to its 
TR35 list of this year’s top 35 
innovators under 35.
Harrison’s work involves 
?nding new ways for people 
to control computers. His 
work looks at methods of 
control outside the tradition-
al mouse and keyboard.
“Chris has a vision of how 
interfaces to computing pow-
er need to change as our com-
puting environment changes, 
and the technical skills for 
making his ideas work in the 
real world,” said Human-
Computer Interaction Insti-
tute Director Justine Cassell 
in a university press release. 
“I can’t think of a better addi-
tion to the TR35 pantheon.”
During his time at Carn-
egie Mellon, Harrison has 
worked on and engineered 
many projects in his area of 
interest, including Minput, 
which turns mobile devices 
into computer mice, and Om-
niTouch, a system that turns 
almost any surface into a 
touchscreen.
Harrison was also the 
recipient of a Google Ph.D. 
fellowship earlier this year, 
and, together with human-
computer interaction Ph.D. 
student Robert Xiao, received 
the Qualcomm Innovation 
Fellowship on behalf of Carn-
egie Mellon University.

University Police were 
summoned to Baker Hall at 
approximately 3:30 p.m. re-
garding a suspicious person 
who was observed entering 
numerous of?ces in the psy-
chology department. The of-
?cers located the male, who 
gave varying accounts of his 
purpose on campus, none of 
which could be veri?ed. The 
male was escorted from the 
building and warned that, if 
he returned without being 
accompanied by a Carnegie 
Mellon af?liate, he would be 
arrested for de?ant trespass.
Theft

Underage Drinking
Aug. 23, 2012
University Police were 
summoned by the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Police to 
assist them with an under-
age Carnegie Mellon student 
under the in?uence of alco-
hol who appeared to be lost.

CMU Philharmonic to play original suite for centennial
lem,” St. Clair said.
The GCC is one of the 
ways the university hopes to 
satisfy the MSAA’s sugges-
tion.
Joanna Wolfe, director of 
the GCC, said the center will 
start off with 11 tutors — all 
master’s students — with 
more tutors to be added later. 
Tutors are currently undergo-
ing training, to be completed 
within the next three to four 
weeks.
Although Hunt Library’s 
?rst ?oor will probably be 
undergoing renovations for 
most of the fall, the GCC 
will begin tutoring students 
sooner. 
“We’re going to be open-
ing in three weeks in a tem-
porary space in FMS,” Wolfe 
said. “It’s going to be hard to 
?nd, but we will have instruc-
tions on our website, which 
is not up yet. So we will be 
ready in three weeks to ac-
cept appointments on a lim-
ited basis, but in four weeks 
we’ll be full-time, full-staff.”
According to Wolfe, stu-
dents should try to bring to 
their tutoring appointment a 
copy of the assignment they 
need help with, a model es-
say from that class, or any-
thing they’ve worked out 
thus far, as all these will help 
the tutors to best mentor the 
student. 
Students will be able to 
schedule a tutoring session 
through the GCC website af-
ter it launches.
While the renovations are 
being made with students in 
mind, the resulting noise is a 
slight disturbance to people 
studying on the ?rst ?oor.
“It’s a little bit noisy since 
it’s right there, but very 
clean,” said Meng Zhang, a 
master’s student in urban de-
sign.
“Of course there is con-
cern about the fact that it’s 
disruption and there’s noise,” 
St. Clair said. “I don’t think 
there are any big concerns 
about the end result. I think 
everyone in the library is very 
happy that we’re able to bring 
the Global Communications 
Center in.... What I hear from 
students is that they want 
more comfortable spaces and 
more aesthetic spaces, and I 
think that in both cases we’ll 
be able to meet their needs.”

In his of?cial statement, 
Pitt Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg thanked local and federal 
law enforcement as well as the 
Pitt community for their sup-
port during the bomb threat 
?asco. He cited examples of 
people who went out of their 
way to help, including a ca-
nine of?cer from McKeesport 
who made late-night trips on 
his own time to perform bomb 
sweeps, and faculty members 
who patrolled doorways and 
conducted classes on campus 
lawns.
“Everyone in the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh commu-
nity is deeply grateful for the 
many forms of help that were 
extended to us while our cam-
pus was under siege and for 
all of the hard work that was 
done,” Nordenberg said in the 
statement.
Although Busby’s indict-
ment has provided some an-
swers, many students remain 
puzzled.
Carnegie Mellon sopho-
more computer science major 
Eric Lee said, “Considering 
that no bombs were actually 
detonated at the school, it 
seems almost ?tting that the 
threats were as random as 
they were pointless.”
Some, like Pitt ?rst-year 
engineering major Erin Sa-
rosi, are just happy to see 
progress. Sarosi applied to 
Pitt while the threats were oc-
curring. “It wasn’t hindering 
me from going here,” Sarosi 
said. “I think it’s still a pretty 
safe campus.”

Marcel Just, a professor in 
the department of psychology 
and the director for the Cen-
ter for Cognitive Brain Imag-
ing, is the 2012 winner of the 
Society for Text and Discourse 
Distinguished Scienti?c Con-
tribution Award.
“Marcel has been a pioneer 
in psycholinguistic research 
for four decades, employing 
cutting-edge technologies for 
understanding online reading 
comprehension in healthy in-
dividuals, as well as individu-
als with autism, dyslexia, and 
brain damage,” according to 
the program from the award 
ceremony. “He was one of the 
?rst to use fMRI to investigate 
the neural bases of reading 
comprehension.”
In Just’s own opinion, his 
main contribution is his work 
toward a better understand-
ing of relating language com-
prehension to its interplay 
with brain function. The goal 
of his research is to explain 
the psychological processes, 
such as parsing or meaning 
retrieval, in order to give a de-
scription of brain functioning 
at the brain-system level.
“It is a great honor when 
your colleagues say, ‘This is 
great work.’ It is always ex-
tremely heartening when 
one’s colleagues acknowledge 
or honor a contribution,” Just 
said. 
Although Just was hon-
ored to receive the award, 
he expressed the importance 
of having one’s own values 
to drive research. “You have 
to develop your own sense of 
values of what is important, 
of what is progressing well, 
what innovations to pursue, 
which old lines of research to 
put aside,” he said.
Just received the award 
in Montreal in July. In the 
same month, he gave a key-
note lecture titled “Changing 
Brains for Changing Times,” 
which focused on the fact 
that the human brain is much 
more malleable and ?ex-
ible than scientists previously 
thought. 
“We know that, in infor-
mation processing terms, 
you could learn new things, 
but what I think wasn’t quite 
appreciated was how overt, 
measurable, and large the 
biological changes are in the 
brain,” he explained.
By performing small per-
ceptual tasks, such as learning 
how to write backwards, Just 
said, one can change the cir-
cuitry in the brain in as little 
as four-and-a-half hours. The 
circuitry that consists of cells 
that transmit signals from one 
region of the brain to another, 
referred to as “white matter,” 
makes up 45 percent of the 
brain.
“Wherever you go in life, 
you’re constantly learning 
things, and what you’re doing 
is changing your brain,” Just 
said.
There are hindrances 
alongside the bene?ts of brain 
malleability. For example, 
post-traumatic stress disor-
der signi?cantly changes the 
hippocampus, a major mem-
ory-associated component 
of the human brain. Chronic 
stress also causes measurable 
changes in the hippocampus. 
“We need to appreciate 
that the way we live our lives 
really has an impact on our 
brains,” he said.
In the early 2000s, Just’s 
research team helped with 
a large project in Pittsburgh 
studying children with dys-
lexia. The scientists gave them 
100 hours of instruction, in 
which they were taught how 
to decode words. At the end 
of this remedial training, the 
dyslexic children were sig-
ni?cantly better readers. The 
children’s white matter had 
changed, showing similarities 
to normal readers.
“There are many brain dis-
orders that affect the white 
matter, and now we know 
that we can ?x the white mat-
ter behaviorally,” Just said. 
An ongoing project of 
Just’s team involves a theory 
of autism the team devel-
oped called “frontal posterior 
under-connectivity,” which 
states that the major issue 
with autism is the connec-
tivity between the front part 
of the brain and the poste-
rior parts. Just’s team has 
observed that white matter 
in people with autism is dif-
ferent than those without the 
disorder.
“All this points to a way 
to develop therapies, to di-
agnose people with greater 
certainty, to develop biologi-
cal markers of autism,” Just 
said.

From childhood scrapes to 
the removal of wisdom teeth, 
the human body displays an 
amazing ability to heal itself. 
Once an injury occurs, a cas-
cade of chemical reactions be-
gins in a carefully regulated, 
multistep process until the 
damage is repaired.
Oftentimes we take this 
ability for granted and take 
risks that can lead to severe 
injuries. Without the healing 
process, our bodies would 
not be able to endure all the 
damage we expose them to 
throughout our lifetimes. 
Imagine the extreme care 
that would have to be taken 
if our bodies didn’t have this 
ability; even a simple paper 
cut could be deadly.
The skin, the largest organ 
in our bodies, acts as a protec-
tive barrier from the outside 
environment. Two layers of 
the skin, the epidermis and 
dermis, contain blood vessels 
that transport blood through-
out the body. This protective 
barrier is broken after an in-
jury, exposing blood vessels 
and causing bleeding. 
As an instinctive attempt 
to stop bleeding, the body 
enters the ?rst stage of the 
healing process, known as 
hemostasis. According to an 
article published in Alterna-
tive Medicine Review, chemi-
cals are released by muscle 
tissue around the damage to 
constrict the damaged blood 
vessels, reducing the amount 
of blood ?ow to the area and 
limiting blood loss. 
According to WebMD, tis-
sue that makes up the skin 
underneath is made up of 
proteins called collagen. In 
the event of an injury, small 
disk-shaped structures in the 
blood called platelets interact 
with collagen and cause the 
blood to coagulate or stick 
together, forming a scab that 
temporarily seals the break in 
the blood vessel.
As the bleeding is con-
trolled, the body slowly en-
ters the in?ammatory phase 
of healing that is often as-
sociated with pain. Here, the 
platelets release chemicals 
that attract special types 
of white blood cells to the 
wound. These cells ?ood the 
wound, acting as the body’s 
immune system, where they 
engulf and destroy debris and 
harmful bacteria. These cells 
act as the ?rst line of defense 
against infection, dominating 
the area of the wound for the 
?rst two days.
Over the next few days, 
the white blood cells con-
tinue to digest bacteria and 
dead tissue cells. Once bleed-
ing has subsided and the 
wound is free from infection, 
it enters the rebuilding stage. 
Also known as the prolifera-
tive stage, this stage is when 
cells create new collagen and 
increase the strength of the 
wound.
White blood cells known 
as ?broblasts eventually ma-
ture into smooth muscle cells. 
As they transform into what 
are known as myo?broblasts, 
they develop characteristics 
of muscles, such as the ability 
to contract. This establishes 
the ?nal stage of wound 
healing, where the myo?bro-
blasts pull the wound edges 
together. Over time, more col-
lagen is deposited to protect 
the wound from reopening, 
creating scar tissue. 
Although scar tissue and 
normal skin both contain 
collagen, scar tissue has a 
higher concentration of it, 
which makes it look differ-
ent from the surrounding 
skin. Collagen in normal skin 
overlaps in many directions, 
giving a smooth appearance. 
In contrast, collagen in scar 
tissue is usually aligned in 
one direction, giving it a more 
textured look. 
Our bodies contain all 
the cells necessary to rebuild 
damaged tissue. However, 
these cells require various 
vitamins and nutrients that 
must come from our diet. Vi-
tamin C is used for collagen 
synthesis, and vitamin A is 
used to develop blood ves-
sels. Other nutrients, such as 
zinc, are necessary for DNA 
synthesis for new developing 
cells.  
Wounds are an inescap-
able part of human lives, 
and luckily, the human body 
can recover from the major-
ity of minor cuts and scrapes 
with very little intervention. 
Larger wounds often need 
outside medical attention to 
more quickly stop bleeding 
or further prevent infection. 
Still, doctors rely heavily on 
the body’s ability to ?x itself 
over time.

West Nile outbreak one of the largest for this time of year
Federal health of?cials an-
nounced this week that the 
current U.S. outbreak of West 
Nile virus is one of the largest 
seen in the country. As of last 
Thursday, 1,118 cases were 
reported, over half of them in 
Texas. The number of reports 
by this time of year is typically 
fewer than 300. Scientists be-
lieve that the combination of 
a mild winter, an early spring, 
and a very hot summer is a 
contributing factor to the out-
break.
The virus is transmitted by 
mosquitoes, which pick the 
virus up from birds they bite. 
Only one in ?ve infected peo-
ple gets sick, and the symp-
toms can include headache, 
body aches, and fever. One in 
150 people may develop se-
vere symptoms, which can re-
sult in coma and paralysis.

After 352 million miles, NASA cheers for 23 feet
This week, NASA’s Mars 
rover Curiosity completed 
a successful test drive. The 
16-minute trip consisted of 
moving forward 15 feet, turn-
ing 120 degrees, and backing 
up eight feet. After complet-
ing its 352-million-mile trip to 
the surface of Mars earlier this 
month, the team is thrilled 
about the recent 23-foot 
journey.
“It couldn’t be more impor-
tant,” Peter Theisinger, the 
mission’s project manager, 
said at a news conference af-
ter the drive. “I mean, we built 
a rover. So unless the rover 
roves, we really haven’t ac-
complished anything.”
Curiosity is to spend a few 
years exploring the surface of 
Mars in attempt to ?gure out 
whether the planet was ever 
habitable for microbial life.

Scientists recognize conciousness of some animals
An international group 
of scientists signed The 
Cambridge Declaration on 
Consciousness, which sup-
ports the idea that animals 
have a similar degree of con-
sciousness and awareness as 
humans. The list of animals in-
cludes all mammals, all birds, 
and the octopus. The scientists 
claim more evidence shows 
that humans are not unique 
in possessing the neurological 
makeup that generates con-
sciousness.
The declaration, which was 
signed in the presence of phys-
icist Stephen Hawking, states 
that “the ?eld of Conscious-
ness research is rapidly evolv-
ing. ... more data is becoming 
readily available, and this calls 
for a periodic reevaluation of 
previously held preconcep-
tions in this ?eld.”

Insect wings much stronger than previously thought
Researchers at Trinity Col-
lege in Dublin have recently 
found that the wings of in-
sects are not as fragile as 
they look. To measure insect 
wings’ strength, the scien-
tists produced tiny cracks in 
locust wings and measured 
the amount of force required 
to make the crack grow and 
permeate through the wing. 
After examining video of the 
forced cracks, they found that 
once the crack had reached 
a wing vein, crack growth 
stopped.
Insects such as grasshop-
pers travel long distances with 
wings 10 times thinnner than 
a human hair. The researchers 
believe that the vein pattern 
found in insect wings could 
inspire the design of more du-
rable and lightweight arti?cial 
“venous” wings for aircraft.

Doctors ?nding help through Facebook
Doctors at the Mayo Clin-
ic recently used Facebook 
to investigate the stroke of 
a 56-year-old woman. The 
stroke happened as a result of 
a clogged artery in her neck, 
and doctors needed to deter-
mine whether the blockage 
was a result of trauma or of 
risk factors such as diabetes or 
heart disease.
One doctor noticed that 
the patient’s right eyelid was 
more droopy than the left, 
which is commonly associated 
with trauma. The doctors ex-
amined the patient’s Facebook 
pro?le pictures and found that 
the droopy eyelid symptom 
was a recent development, so 
the artery blockage was likely 
caused by trauma. Knowing 
the cause of blockage can 
help doctors prevent future 
strokes.

Apple victorious, Samsung loses patent trial
A federal grand jury in 
San Jose, Calif., found that 
Samsung had violated many 
of Apple’s patents. Apple was 
awarded $1 billion in dam-
ages. The jury found that Sam-
sung violated utility patents 
as well as design patents, and 
found some of the comany’s 
infringements “willful.” The 
jury did not award Samsung 
any damages on any of its 
counter-claims.
The verdict “could lead to 
an outright ban on sales of key 
Samsung products and will 
likely solidify Apple’s domi-
nance of the exploding mobile 
computing market,” Reuters 
reported.

El Gallo de Oro shows lack of true health initiative
As students begin to trickle back 
to campus, they may notice the pres-
ence of El Gallo de Oro, the new and 
improved version of Sí Señor.
Kim Abel, the director of Carne-
gie Mellon Housing and Dining, said 
to The Tartan last week that El Gal-
lo de Oro will have a very different 
menu from Sí Señor, and that this is 
a response to changes desired by the 
student body. 
But, as reported, the new Tex-
Mex eatery will have the same ven-
dor and owner, as well as eerily 
similar food items, such as burritos, 
quesadillas, and the somewhat out-
of-place brownies.
Implementing a new menu in or-
der to have a greater appeal to the 
students, faculty, and visitors could 
have been seen as a notable accom-
plishment — it’s something that ev-
ery eatery on campus should strive 
for. 
But to say that drastic changes 
have been made to the restaurant 
from its unhealthy origins is ridicu-
lous. See for yourselves — El Gallo 
de Oro has not changed its vendor, 
its style of food, or its basic menu. It’s 
the same old Sí Señor, poorly hidden 
by the new image of El Gallo de Oro.
The low calorie options that are 
touted by El Gallo de Oro aren’t do-
ing enough to convince students 
that they’re truly healthy choices. 
The burrito bowl merely lists what 
ingredients comprise its 565 calo-
ries. Seeing more vegetarian options 
or additional green snacks besides 
fresh fruit would possibly help the 
former Sí Señor’s reputation of being 
one of the least healthy restaurants 
on campus.
Hiding behind a different name 
seems questionable and, frankly, 
unappetizing. Moreover, if Hous-
ing and Dining wanted a healthier 
Tex-Mex option, why is the classic 
Sí Señor brownie still offered as a 
dessert? Why are half of Sí Señor’s 
menu items still there under differ-
ent names?
It may be hard to balance the tra-
ditional Tex-Mex of Sí Señor and the 
health craze that many restaurants 
cater to nowadays. Yet trying to play 
off both isn’t the solution. Ultimate-
ly, a poor combination can leave a 
bad taste in your mouth.

Students must give more input for shuttle changes
August signals the end of sum-
mer, the return of Carnegie Mellon 
students to campus, and the Carn-
egie Mellon Shuttle and Escort Ser-
vices’ almost annual route changes.
We all long for a little stability 
when it comes to public transpor-
tation, and while it seems that the 
university’s transportation service is 
continually seeking to improve itself, 
it is our right to speak up to improve 
transit for Carnegie Mellon students.
If you are a student and have been 
checking your email inbox, you’ll 
have noticed some new shuttle and 
escort changes. 
The escort service is now ar-
ranged into four different color 
zones instead of neighborhood ar-
eas, some stops on Craig Street have 
been cut due to safety concerns, and 
the Green?eld neighborhood has 
been added to the Pittsburgh Tech-
nology Center shuttle route.
In theory, all these changes 
should be positive, helping to im-
prove transportation around cam-
pus. But until these theories are put 
into practice, they have little mean-
ing. These changes, implemented 
over the summer, will soon face the 
scrutiny of the students and faculty 
that use the services.
We have to admit that the shuttle 
and escort services are often hard 
and thankless jobs. No matter the 
changes in service, somebody some-
where will always feel that they are 
lacking in one way or another. Trans-
portation in Pittsburgh isn’t doing so 
well as it is, what with the Port Au-
thority struggling along and threat-
ening to cut service left and right.
Regardless, know that Carnegie 
Mellon welcomes the involvement of 
its students in important discussions 
like transportation. We urge you to 
take advantage of the shuttle and es-
cort services, note the new changes, 
and — if you feel that something is 
lacking — speak up. For the past year 
or so, the university has been hold-
ing various meetings about private 
and public transportation. In addi-
tion, student government — and this 
year’s executive branch in particular 
— has made a commitment to im-
proving and advocating for better 
student transportation.
Attending Student Senate meet-
ings or going to student govern-
ment’s of?ce hours can help you 
voice your opinions. Getting involved 
is what truly gets initiatives moving 
and what will make any transporta-
tion changes bene?cial and lasting.
The start of the school year is 
both a happy and stressful time. The 
uncertainties of housing, though, 
can supplant the joys of returning to 
independent collegiate life. Students 
often hear stories of others with 
unfortunate or inadequate campus 
housing situations, such as students 
having to live in the Wyndham Gar-
den Hotel back in 2006, or how some 
dorms changed to ?rst-year exclu-
sive residences in 2008 and left up-
perclassmen frustrated.
When coming to college, ?rst-
years shouldn’t have to worry if 
they’ll have adequate on-campus 
housing. 
Housing and residence policies 
for all universities should focus on 
optimizing the living arrangements 
for their new and largely dependent 
?rst-year students, while also work-
ing to provide suf?cient housing for 
others wishing to live on campus.
Upperclassmen may have com-
plaints about the housing situation as 
well. Preference is given to students 
by age in the housing lottery system, 
with seniors getting ?rst choice. This 
may dissuade younger students from 
trying to maintain campus housing.
Also, should upperclassmen out-
side of the housing system wish to 
return to on-campus residences, they 
will ?nd the process “very dif?cult,” 
according to the Carnegie Mellon 
Housing Assignments FAQ.
Yet poor housing shouldn’t be an 
issue that incoming ?rst-years face, 
especially when the cheapest rate for 
on-campus housing is $6,020 for the 
academic year.
In order to deal with limited 
housing, the University of Pittsburgh 
has a 12-year plan that culiminates 
in the building of a new ?rst-year 
dorm on Fifth Avenue. According the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, this addition 
will add 559 beds for ?rst-year stu-
dents at Pitt.
Initiatives like this one are a step 
in the right direction for ensuring 
housing for ?rst-year students. While 
the scope of Pitt’s ?rst-year housing 
issues are clearly larger, what with 
being a state school with a much 
larger student population, Carnegie 
Mellon Housing Services would be 
wise to look at similar ways to ad-
dress these problems.
Adequate housing for ?rst-years should be a priority
Akin’s rape comment re?ects GOP policies
ANNA WALSH
You’ve probably already heard 
about U.S. Representative Todd 
Akin’s now-infamous statement 
made last week: “From what I un-
derstand from doctors, [pregnancy 
from rape] is really rare,” Akin told 
KTVI Fox News. “If it’s a legitimate 
rape, the female body has ways to 
try to shut that whole thing down.”
The criticism immediately rolled 
in — President Obama held a press 
conference the following day in 
which he criticized Akin, saying, 
“The idea that we should be pars-
ing and qualifying and slicing what 
types of rape we are talking about 
doesn’t make sense to the American 
people and certainly doesn’t make 
sense to me.”
But Democrats weren’t the only 
one condemning Akin: Republican 
politicians were quick to distance 
themselves from him, and both the 
Republican Senatorial Campaign 
Committee and the conservative Su-
per PAC American Crossroads have 
announced that they will no longer 
fund his campaign. Even vice-presi-
dential candidate Paul Ryan called 
Akin and asked him to drop out of 
Missouri’s Senate race, according to 
Akin.
One might consider it a good 
thing that the GOP is trying to dis-
tance itself from Akin — after all, 
that’s a sign that most Republican 
politicians disagree with his state-
ments and are a little more reason-
able and educated, right?
But when you look at the facts, it 
becomes pretty clear that Akin isn’t 
an anomaly of the Republican party.
First is his completely misguided 
belief that the female body can ap-
parently detect rape and prevent 
itself from becoming pregnant. Ob-
viously, this is ludicrous — in fact, a 
2003 study using data from the Unit-
ed States National Violence Against 
Women survey found that the rate 
at which women become pregnant 
from rape is twice the rate of preg-
nancy from consensual sexual acts.
Akin released an apology video a 
few days after his initial statement in 
which he admitted that pregnancy 
can occur from rape. But despite his 
correction, his statement revealed 
his apparent ignorance on how the 
female reproductive system works, a 
reoccurring theme with several con-
servatives.
After law student Sandra Fluke 
read a statement in May about the 
costs of birth control, Rush Lim-
baugh went on a now-infamous rant 
against her, calling her a “slut” and 
saying, “She wants to be paid to 
have sex. She’s having so much sex 
she can’t afford the contraception.” 
Offensiveness aside, his statement 
revealed that he apparently doesn’t 
understand how birth control 
works; the amount of birth control 
pills a woman takes is completely in-
dependent of the amount of sex that 
she has.
Similarly, many conservatives, 
including Akin, Mitt Romney, and 
Newt Gingrich, have spoken out 
against the morning-after pill, a 
form of birth control they claim is 
equivalent to abortion. The science, 
though, simply does not support 
that. The morning-after pill doesn’t 
prevent a fertilized egg from attach-
ing to the uterus, as conservatives 
claim; rather, the pill prevents an 
egg from being fertilized in the ?rst 
place, meaning that no pregnancy 
occurs.
While these examples may not 
be as extreme as Akin’s inane state-
ment about the female body’s ability 
to prevent pregnancy from rape, it 
shows that many of the male con-
servative politicians who seem so 
concerned with birth control and 
the female body ironically don’t un-
derstand how either works.
Then there’s Akin’s phrase, “le-
gitimate rape.” Many conservatives 
have been quick to criticize Akin’s 
word choice; when asked about 
Akin’s statement, Ryan replied, 
“Rape is rape, period. End of story.”
But this all begs the question: 
What would Akin consider “illegiti-
mate” rape? He already answered 
that question last year when he co-
sponsored the “No Taxpayer Fund-
ing for Abortion Act,” which would 
have only allowed federal funds to 
be used to terminate pregnancies 
that were a result of “forcible” rape.
This essentially would have 
meant that, were you a 13-year-
old victim of statutory rape or had 
you been drugged by your rapist 
before he assaulted you, your rape 
“wouldn’t count.” 
This wasn’t only the language of 
one extreme politician: The bill ac-
tually passed the Republican-con-
trolled House of Representatives, 
although the phase “forcible rape” 
was later removed thanks to public 
outcry. Also worth noting: One of 
the bill’s co-sponsors was none other 
than Ryan.
And despite Akin’s apology, he 
still stands by his assertion that abor-
tion should be banned even in cases 
of rape or incest. This may seem like 
an extreme stance to take on abor-
tion, but rather than being a fringe 
belief, this stance has now become 
a central pillar of the Republican 
Party’s beliefs. The newest iteration 
of the party’s of?cial platform calls 
for a constitutional amendment 
protecting the fetus’ “fundamental 
individual right to life,” but does not 
mention if exceptions should be al-
lowed in cases of rape and incest.
So the real faux pas Akin made 
in the eyes of the Republican Party 
wasn’t his beliefs — clearly his ideas 
are in line with those of many other 
conservatives. The real reason con-
servatives are tripping over them-
selves to keep their distance from 
Akin is that his blunt delivery laid 
those conservative views bare, with-
out dressing them up in the usual 
innocent-sounding political jargon.
The Republican Party can try to 
cover those views back up by releas-
ing nice sound bites saying “rape is 
rape” and by begging Akin to drop 
out of the Senate race, but that 
doesn’t change the fact that Akin’s 
statement matches the Republican 
Party’s actions. And once the major-
ity of Americans realize that, their 
outrage won’t merely be focused on 
one Senatorial candidate from Mis-
souri.
Anna Walsh (amwalsh@) is acting 
personnel manager for The Tartan.
When you look at the facts, it becomes 
pretty clear that Akin isn’t an anomaly of 
the Republican party.

A PERSON’S OPINION
Compiled by Jonathan Carreon and Jennifer Coloma
The return to college always has a cinematic feel to it. So we asked,
If your upcoming school year were a movie, what would it be called?

Common courtesy is necessary for walking on sidewalks
EMILY DOBLER
 I grew up close to New York City 
— famous for its pizza, pronunciation 
of cawfee, and erratic drivers. But its 
residents are famous for something 
else: knowing how to walk. I don’t 
mean they know how to strut or have 
more swagger; I mean that they don’t 
travel in hordes of 20 people and take 
up the entire sidewalk.
When I ?rst came to Carnegie 
Mellon, the prevalence of bad walk-
ing was a shock. As a ?rst-year I 
didn’t have a car, and the timeliness 
of the bus system is always a gamble, 
so walking was how I got around. 
But this proved dif?cult when I 
would try to walk against the grain 
of a massive entourage of fellow stu-
dents on a given sidewalk. The crowd 
saw me approaching and continued 
on its merry way as I attempted to 
walk by. 
On multiple occasions, I was 
forced into the street because a large 
group of friends simply didn’t under-
stand how to let a single person walk 
through their cluster — or they didn’t 
bother to care, which is worse.
Among ?rst-years, this mental-
ity is especially pervasive. You’re in a 
new place that will have a huge im-
pact on your life. You’re away from 
your friends, family, and every com-
fort zone. 
During your ?rst few weeks here, 
you want to meet everyone you 
can and accumulate a solid core of 
friends to feel at home. But it’s easy 
to go overboard, inviting your whole 
?oor to dinner instead of two close 
friends. 
Luckily, this horde mentality even-
tually dies down and people learn to 
be okay with walking in a group of 
two or three, or even by themselves. 
This year’s incoming ?rst-years were 
no different than any other incoming 
class. 
As I watched their arrival to cam-
pus, I legitimately feared having to 
walk between Craig Street and More-
wood Avenue. As expected, I was 
once again forced into the street by 
the clusters of ?rst-years insisting on 
having a giant entourage everywhere 
they went.
This is just rude to everyone else 
on the sidewalk. Apply the overused 
axiom, “Do unto others as you would 
have them do unto you.” If you see 
someone trying to get by your group, 
move over. Don’t force them to en-
danger their life by having to step 
into a busy street just to get around.
So ?rst-years — and anyone else 
who does this — please do everyone 
on campus a favor and watch where 
you’re going next time you venture 
outside your dormitory with your en-
tire ?oor.
I’m assuming you and your friends 
didn’t overrun the sidewalks of your 
hometown before coming to Carn-
egie Mellon. Were you driving a car, 
you wouldn’t drive down all three 
lanes on Forbes Avenue; apply that 
same logic when walking around. 
Just use common sense next time 
you’re out and about on campus and 
Pittsburgh.

Stricter gun control not the answer to violence
JONATHAN CARREON 
Gun control is a dif?cult topic to 
discuss because of poorly framed sta-
tistics and the passionate response 
from those personally affected by 
it. There is not enough space in an 
article to completely explain why 
gun control is not a viable solution, 
so instead I want to offer a few re-
sponses to some common claims by 
proponents of stricter gun control.
First, there is the claim that if you 
own a gun, you or someone you live 
with will shoot another person by 
accident. Last year, there were 613 
unintentional deaths by ?rearm, ac-
cording to the National Safety Coun-
cil. Compare this to 1,489 fatalities 
in 1989. A recent Gallup poll esti-
mated that 45 percent of American 
homes contain at least one ?rearm 
— a ?gure that has stayed roughly 
the same since the 1960s.
To frame this, consider that you 
are four to ?ve times more likely to 
be accidentally killed by a police of-
?cer than you are by a civilian gun 
owner. Moreover, the odds of death 
by choking on food, falling down 
the stairs, or having something fall 
on your head are roughly the same 
as those of being accidentally shot. 
Yet the emotional response to gun 
accidents far outweighs that of other 
causes of death.
Another claim of gun control 
activists is that cutting out guns re-
duces violent crime rates. Consider 
Australia and the United Kingdom; 
both countries strictly control legal 
gun ownership. According to the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics, the 
rates of sexual assault and robbery 
have remained mostly unchanged 
while the rate of assaults has risen 
by more than 8 percent since the 
gun bans were enacted in 1996.
The United Kingdom also has 
the highest violent crime rate in the 
European Union at around 2,000 in-
cidents per 100,000 people, accord-
ing to annual Eurostat crime trends 
data. That is four times as many vio-
lent crimes per capita as those in the 
U.S. The United Kingdom handgun 
bans were enacted in 1997.
A third claim is that because po-
lice of?cers have guns, there’s no 
reason for private ownership. Of 
the approximately 794,300 police 
of?cers and detectives in the U.S., 
maybe 150,000 of them are actually 
on duty at a given time and available 
to respond to an emergency, assum-
ing that they have three shifts a day 
and they are occupying non-admin-
istrative positions.
Given that 311 million people 
live in the U.S., that leaves about 
one of?cer per 2,000 people. From 
the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 
among crimes of violence response 
times, only 53.4 percent were within 
10 minutes, with 8.8 percent taking 
more than an hour for a response.
Guns are easy to use for both 
criminals and law-abiding citizens. 
You have to look past the high-
visibility instances of guns used in 
crimes and refocus on the collective 
trends at play. Civilian-owned ?re-
arms reduce crime occurrences and 
keep people safe. Learn how to use a 
?rearm or read more about the poli-
tics involved before you allow one 
of your greatest rights to be taken 
away.

Withholding diplomas is a cheap move
CARL GLAZER
Last week, Oklahoma City’s 
NewsChannel 4 reported that a 
high school valedictorian in Prague, 
Okla., was blocked from receiving 
her diploma because she altered 
her graduation speech and used 
the word “hell” instead of the pre-
approved “heck.”
Kaitlin Nootbaar, the student in 
question, had completed all required 
schoolwork with a 4.0 GPA and was 
not informed of any issue until she 
went to pick up her physical diplo-
ma. The school has commented that 
it will give Nootbaar her diploma 
when she issues a formal apology for 
her actions.
This type of diploma withholding 
in response to non-academic issues 
is a common practice for schools to 
control students during the ?nal few 
weeks of classes. However, these 
punishments cheapen the four years 
of dedication and effort needed to 
achieve that academic recognition.
At the federal, state, and indi-
vidual school levels, there are vari-
ous academic requirements that 
each student must achieve in order 
to graduate and be awarded a di-
ploma. If a student meets all of these 
requirements, it’s naturally assumed 
that he or she will be given a diploma 
to represent that achievement. For 
most people, a high school diploma 
holds mostly sentimental value — 
since you are of?cially a high school 
graduate regardless of that piece of 
paper — but some professions and 
colleges require a copy of your di-
ploma as credentials.
Schools have resorted to with-
holding diplomas because they have 
limited options for punishing stu-
dents at the end of their senior years. 
Some high schools use the inability to 
walk across the stage at graduation 
as a deterrent to end-of-the-year she-
nanigans. Others withhold diplomas 
from students who are not the best 
behaved during their ?nal weeks of 
classes. Both of these options have a 
much further-reaching impact than 
do the standard suspension or deten-
tion that these same crimes would 
garner during the school year. 
Graduation is a celebration not 
only for the students, but also for 
those who supported them through-
out their long educational journeys. 
There are still many students in this 
country who are the ?rst in their 
families to have the opportunity 
to graduate from high school and 
go to college. Threatening to ruin 
this achievement for minor infrac-
tions such as saying “hell” instead 
of “heck” does not give this possibly 
life-changing moment the gravitas it 
deserves.
While there is a need to keep 
seniors in check in the ?nal weeks 
of their high school careers, using 
graduation threats is not an appro-
priate way to do so. As these students 
prepare to enter a new stage of their 
lives, full of new responsibilities, 
schools should be setting a better ex-
ample than petty extortion.

SPORTS COMMENTARYSteelers new season
CARL GLAZER
Staffwriter
With training camp 
wrapped up and less than two 
weeks until the NFL starts 
its regular season, it is time 
to take a look at some off-
season story lines and how 
they will affect the Pittsburgh 
Steelers once the games start 
to matter.
One of the biggest 
changes involved the coaches 
rather than players. Todd 
Haley, former head coach of 
the Kansas City Chiefs, was 
brought in to replace offen-
sive coordinator Bruce Ari-
ans. Art Rooney II, the Steel-
ers’ president and co-owner, 
wanted to reinvigorate the 
offense, believing that the 
plays had grown ?at and that 
traditional Steeler smash-
mouth football was not what 
it used to be.
Judging by the high-?ying 
offense used while he was 
the offensive coordinator for 
the Arizona Cardinals dur-
ing their Super Bowl run, 
Haley brings a more abra-
sive personality to the table. 
After starting quarterback 
Ben Roethlisberger’s public 
support of the ?red Arians, 
fans are curious about how 
Big Ben will work with the 
temperamental Haley.Will 
this change bring some life 
back to the stale Pittsburgh 
offense?
Part of the problem with 
the Steelers’ offense last sea-
son was keeping Roethlis-
berger upright and healthy in 
the pocket.
To address this need, the 
team took guard David De-
Castro out of Stanford Uni-
versity and offensive tackle 
Mike Adams from Ohio State 
University in the April rookie 
draft.
Adding these young 
talents next to third-year 
pro-bowl center Maurkice 
Pouncey transforms the of-
fensive line from a revolving 
door of injured veterans to a 
young core that could domi-
nate the league for years to 
come.
So far in training camp, 
DeCastro has looked fantas-
tic as right guard, making 
few mental errors and show-
ing good footwork and fun-
damentals.
Adams has looked more 
like a rookie, struggling to 
adjust to guarding Roethlis-
berger’s blind side at the left 
tackle position.
It’s unreasonable to ex-
pect these young linemen to 
play to their full potential this 
year, but they should be im-
provements from last year’s 
team and they will grow as 
this season continues.
Another tale from the 
off-season is Mike Wallace’s 
holdout.
The starting wide receiver 
was offered a standard re-
strictive free agent contract, 
which — while far below 
market value — is all the 
Steelers are required to give 
him.
Wallace showed his dis-
pleasure by holding out on 
team activities, including 
workouts, training camp, and 
preseason games.
Unfortunately for him, 
Wallace’s holdout has only 
allowed wide receiver Anto-
nio Brown to further cement 
his place as the Steelers’ top 
offensive playmaker, paving 
the way for him to become 
the center of the offense.
This gives fans a lot of 
hope, and eliminates most of 
the leverage Wallace had to 
negotiate with.
Wallace is scheduled to 
end his holdout and rejoin 
the team, but he may have 
already lost his top receiver 
role.
The injuries that plagued 
the Steelers at the end of last 
season can still be felt. Start-
ing running back Rashard 
Mendenhall has been in re-
hab with a torn ACL and is 
not expected back at full 
speed until October at the 
earliest.
His replacement, Issac 
Redman, is currently nursing 
a hip injury and has no time-
table for return.
On the defensive side of 
the ball, the situation is not 
much better as the ?rst- and 
second-string right outside 
linebackers, James Harrison 
and Jason Worilds, are still 
recovering from surgeries. 
Starting nose tackle Casey 
Hampton is currently work-
ing to come back from knee 
and elbow injuries that side-
lined him at the end of last 
year.
The team is returning with 
the same core players on of-
fense and defense, but looks 
to be taking a new philosophy 
on both sides of the ball.
With the addition of Haley 
and the new offensive line-
men, Pittsburgh is poised to 
put up one of its best offen-
sive seasons in recent memo-
ry — that is, if Wallace is still 
sharp after missing camp and 
if Brown keeps on track to 
become one of the league’s 
great receiving threats.
On defense, the team 
is trying to transition to a 
younger group of players, 
but the suffocating defen-
sive play we have all grown 
accustomed to will probably 
remain.
Even though they play in 
one of the toughest football 
divisions with the playoff-
bound Baltimore Ravens and 
up-and-coming Cincinnati 
Bengals, the Steelers should 
make the playoffs, assum-
ing that Roethlisberger stays 
vertical and the injury report 
stays clear.

Hailing from Oak Brook, 
Ill., senior forward Brianna 
Magill is gearing up for her ?-
nal soccer season at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Magill recalled what she 
felt were her greatest accom-
plishments over the past three 
years of playing on the team.
“My proudest moment on 
the team was last year, when 
we played at Johns Hopkins 
and forced them into double 
overtime.
Even though it ended in 
their favor, it was a great team 
effort and showed us that we 
can play with the best teams in 
the nation.
They ended up being un-
defeated for the season and 
[were] very highly ranked,” 
she said.
She began playing soccer 
at age ?ve, and has enjoyed 
improving her game over the 
years. “The most rewarding 
part about being a CMU ath-
lete is getting the opportunity 
to travel and represent the 
university across the nation,” 
Magill said.
For her last season on the 
team, Magill is ready to chal-
lenge herself. 
“Our team goals for the 
season are to win the UAA 
Championships and make it to 
the NCAA playoffs. I think we 
have a really good chance of 
reaching both of these goals, 
because we’re already playing 
better soccer than last year,” 
she said.
Playing on the team al-
lowed her to establish a deep 
connection with her team-
mates. 
“My favorite part about be-
ing on the soccer team is be-
ing around my friends all the 
time. Even though it’s a lot of 
hard work, it’s worth it to be 
surrounded by my best friends 
everyday,” Magill said.
“Bri has great energy and 
brings a lot of joy to practice. 
She is always making people 
laugh. 
On the ?eld, she is ?erce 
and one of the key pieces to 
our offense,” said senior mid-
?elder Stephanie Hare.
Magill was quick to share 
some of the funnier moments 
of her collegiate soccer career. 
“Our coach told us to get on 
the end line, which normally 
means we’re about to do a ?t-
ness test. At the last second 
he told us we could go home. 
A few of us started crying be-
cause we were so happy,” Ma-
gill recalled.
This year, Magill plans to 
?nish her degree in business 
administration, with a focus 
on manufacturing manage-
ment and consulting, and a 
minor in sociology. 
After graduation she hopes 
to have a job in management 
consulting in either New York 
or her home state of Illinois.

Here at the end of August, I 
?nd the state of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates fan base to be perplex-
ing.
If I said your team was 
third in the division and seven 
games out of ?rst, how would 
you feel?  Does being fourth in 
the wild card race make you 
feel any better? 
However, the Pirates seem 
to have built up a fury of spirit 
and enthusiasm among the 
Bucco faithful. While there 
isn’t a lot to be excited about, 
it’s understandable that after 
two decades of sheer medioc-
rity, it’s easy to please the city 
of Pittsburgh.
The last time the Pirates 
?nished with a win-loss re-
cord above .500 was 1992. 
With roughly a month left 
this season, the Pirates sit 10 
games above that .500 mark 
at 68–58. The last time the 
Pirates had a Most Valuable 
Player was in 1992 as well, 
when out?elder Barry Bonds 
won his second MVP before 
leaving for the San Francisco 
Giants. But this year, out?eld-
er Andrew McCutchen is lead-
ing the MVP race with a .346 
batting average to lead the 
National League, and is post-
ing 24 homeruns and 78 runs 
batted in. 
No player is more valuable 
to his team than McCutchen, 
who has a 6.0 wins above re-
placement rating, a tie with 
New York Mets third baseman 
David Wright. It seems the Pi-
rates are headed in the right 
direction. But very quickly 
this façade of success — let’s 
call it the “era of mediocrity 
goggles” — will fade and the 
Bucco Nation will expect 
more.
For example, the Pirates’ 
pitching has been fantastic 
this season. But while pitcher 
A.J. Burnett could be an ace 
over the next few seasons, it’s 
hard to believe that the team 
can count on pitchers John 
Karstens and James MacDon-
ald to consistently play well. 
MacDonald has yet to ?nish a 
season with an earned run av-
erage under 4.0, and Karstens 
has been injury prone, to say 
the least.
On the bright side, Joel 
Hanrahan has been the sec-
ond-best closer in the Nation-
al League — behind the Reds’ 
Aroldis Champan — without 
argument.
There are certainly some 
good things happening with 
Pittsburgh’s baseball scene, 
and fans should be excited 
about what the team has done 
on the ?eld. But I’m afraid 
that excitement will quickly 
result in setting unrealistic ex-
pectations.
Simply put, the Pirates is 
not a playoff team. There is 
not enough offense, there are 
pitching uncertainties, and 
the team plays in the tough-
est division in the National 
League. The Cincinnati Reds 
hold a seven-game lead over 
the Pirates, which is a lot to 
make up in a month.
They still have a chance 
for one of  two wild card spots 
and a chance to play the At-
lanta Braves, miles ahead of 
the rest of the wild card race. 
But with the Los Ange-
les Dodgers’ new ownership 
bringing in over $250 mil-
lion of payroll in one trade, 
the wild card race may not be 
close for long.
But what the Pirates do 
have a chance at — other than 
ending the streak of losing 
seasons — is rebuilding a fan 
base that was indifferent after 
seasons of mediocrity.
I am a strong believer in 
a superstar’s ability to ignite 
excitement among fans.Al-
though McCutchen has been 
the only bright spot in this 
season’s offense, if he can get 
MVP at the end of it, those 
aforementioned and horribly 
named goggles will last a little 
longer.
SPORTS COMMENTARYPirates raise expectations of fans this season
How to exercise more than your brain
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
Do you want to avoid the 
intense time commitment as-
sociated with varsity or club 
sports, but still want to stay in 
shape and maintain a healthy 
lifestyle? To strike that bal-
ance, there are plenty of ways 
to stay active on campus that 
will ?t into any schedule.
Carnegie Mellon has a 
range of gyms — both big and 
small — for those who like to 
work out on their own. The 
majority of dormitories con-
tain small gyms with a few 
cardio machines. These are 
convenient for quick work-
outs in the comfort of your 
own dorm. This is a great op-
tion for people afraid of let-
ting others see them working 
up a sweat.
“I enjoy working out in 
Fairfax if I am too lazy to go 
to campus, but if I am on cam-
pus I enjoy working out in the 
UC pool or Skibo,” said senior 
business major Dan Grif?th.
Skibo Gymnasium, which 
has a weight room on its ?rst 
?oor, is open to all students. 
There is an area on the sec-
ond ?oor where intramural 
?oor hockey is played and a 
room for fencing practices 
on the third ?oor. However, 
the weight room on the third 
?oor is only open to varsity 
athletes.
Many students enjoy work-
ing out in the University Cen-
ter. There is an array of equip-
ment, including weights, 
machines, treadmills, 
and ellipticals. The Uni-
versity Center is a prime 
location for working out 
because of its ?exible hours. 
During the school week, the 
gym opens at 6 a.m. and clos-
es at 2 a.m.
Students are required to 
get a wrist band from the 
equipment desk on the ?rst 
?oor before entering any of 
the University Center’s ?tness 
facilities.
The University Center 
is also home to racquetball 
courts and Wiegand Gymna-
sium, which has two full bas-
ketball courts.
When the weather is nice, 
another place to work out is 
outside around campus. 
There are six 
tennis courts 
in the middle 
of campus 
that you can 
reserve at 
the equip-
ment desk in 
the University 
Center.
When the track 
and ?eld team is 
not practicing, the 
track is great for 
an outdoor run. 
If you are feeling 
more adventur-
ous, going on 
a run through 
Schenley Park 
provides a 
great change 
of scenery. 
“It depends 
on the 
day: Sometimes [I workout] 
in Skibo, sometimes in the 
UC, but lately I have been go-
ing for runs in Schenely Park,” 
said senior chemical engi-
neering major Neil Soni.
If you are someone who 
needs more motivation to 
work out, Carnegie Mellon 
also provides a range of ?t-
ness classes. During the week, 
students can ?nd time for 
popular classes like yoga or 
spinning. Carnegie Mellon 
also offers classes like African-
Caribbean Dance and Masala 
Bhangra. No prior experience 
is necessary for any of these  
    
classes.
Another ?tness option is 
intramural sports. There are 
many options for intramural 
sports: soccer, tennis, and 
softball, among others. It only 
takes a couple of friends to 
make a team, depending on 
the sport. It is a small commit-
ment, usually only one or two 
shortened games a week. If 
you make the playoffs and win 
an intramural championship, 
you and your team win Intra-
mural Champions T-shirts.
However you like to work 
out, you can ?nd a place to do 
it at Carnegie Mellon.

VIA opens East Liberty venue
6119 becomes destination for electronic music lovers
“It was now or never.”
Lauren Goshinski, co-founder and creator of the 
Pittsburgh-based electronic music collective VIA, 
explained that the decision to open a new venue 
— 6119, named for its location at 6119 Penn Ave. — 
came down to “a gut instinct.”
VIA opened the new venue in July, with its first 
public show featuring French hip-hop beat maker 
and electronic musician Onra. The venue has 
been host to a number of electronic shows since 
its opening, and at present VIA’s decision to open 
its own venue seems to have paid off. Attendance 
is high, and community members are responding 
well to the change. “Every single [event] has been 
packed,” Goshinski said.
Before discovering the space at 6119, “the concept 
had been in our minds for a long time,” Goshinski 
said. When she and her colleagues came across an 
abandoned club on the market in East Liberty, the 
opportunity was too good to pass up.
6119 is a unique blend of club and gallery, and 
the venue will allow VIA — which focuses on the 
combination of electronic music and new media 
visuals — to build a community-centered space. 
It has the capacity to incorporate more space-
consuming events and installations. “It offers a 
home base for us to do more educational and art-
based programming,” Goshinski said. “This kind of 
space is what people want.”
In addition to bringing in notable electronic 
musicians throughout the year, 6119 will be one of 
the central stages during this year’s VIA Music and 
New Media Festival in October, which has primarily 
been held on nearby Broad Street in the past. This 
October marks the third year of the annual festival, 
the lineup for which will be announced next week.
Given the attention VIA has garnered in its few 
years of existence and the exciting possibilities that 
the new 6119 location brings, the organization’s 
prospects seem bright. As VIA continues to expand, 
Goshinski encourages members of the Carnegie 
Mellon community to partake in the new VIA scene. 
“We can host a variety of events and we’re very 
open to having people contact us,” she said.
VIA’s annual festival, and now the 6119 venue, are a 
vital part of the growing nightlife and club scene in 
East Liberty. With other nearby venues like AVA and 
Shadow Lounge also bringing in notable acts, East 
Liberty is quickly becoming a center for electronic 
music in Pittsburgh.
6119’s busy schedule of shows continues this Friday 
with a performance by ambient techno DJ Kassem 
Mosse. Its full schedule can be found on the 6119 
Facebook page.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I went out on a couple of 
dates with this girl right 
before school ended for 
the summer, and I thought 
we hit it off pretty well. 
But over the course of the 
summer we drifted apart. 
What’s the best way to 
remind her that I’m totally 
awesome and she’s really 
missing out?
Thanks,
Semester Upon Me, Must

Attention Conundrum, 
Knowing Input Needed
Dear SUMMER LACKIN,
First of all, it’s good that 
you know that you’re a total 
stud. I mean, c’mon, look 
at you! You must drive the 
ladies wild. So, naturally, you 
probably drove this lady wild. 
Now’s the time to put that 
confidence to good use.
There are two approaches 
you can take: Make the first 
move and call her up to 
hang out, or wait until you 
bump into her. The former 
move demonstrates total 
confidence, but if she’s 
forgotten how dashing you 
are, she might think you’re 
coming on too strong. I’d 
recommend the latter. It lets 
you scope out how she feels 
while you lay on the charm. 
Either way, you’ll have to 
step up your wooing game. 
It’s hard enough getting 
a woman once, let alone 
twice.
Or just cut your losses 
and let the rest of 
womankind have a shot 
with you,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I just finished my summer 
internship, and they gave 
me a job offer! I’m really 
excited about it, but none 
of my friends have gotten 
job offers yet. What’s the 
best way to gloat about 
it?
Thanks,
Highly Inconspicuously 
Revealing Employment 
Despite Friends’ 
Irritating Results, Totally 
Showboating
Dear HIRED FIRST,
Congratulations! As the 
first to be employed among 
your friends, you get the 
grand honor of getting to 
buy the first round of beers 
at the bar! Every time. Get 
used to hearing, “Hey man, 
you have a job, but I’m still 
unemployed. You’re flush! 
Help a brother out.” If you 
don’t, you’re cheap.
But don’t worry — I’m here 
to help. First, never mention 
any hiring or signing bonus. 
Don’t bring up the job in 
casual conversation — that 
just reminds them you have 
money to spare. Instead, 
just casually mention how 
bad the job market is with 
a knowing smirk. Offer to 
help your friends with their 
résumés in a condescending 
tone, or accept buying a 
round as the price for your 
gloating.
Or cheer them up by 
reminding them that 
at least they’re not in 
CFA and permanently 
unemployed,
Patrick Hoskins

Artists of the Year showcase new creations
Charlee Brodsky and Vanessa German build intricate and thought-provoking displays
Charlee Brodsky’s exhibit Good Dog features the 
artist’s dog, Max, as the “actor” in each of her photo 
books.
Vanessa German’s piece “America” offers powerful commentary on the American experience through 
homage to African-American folk art. 
The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts is teeming with 
bright creations and new ideas. Charlee Brodsky and 
Vanessa German — who earlier this month were named 
2012 Artist of the Year and Emerging Artist of the Year, 
respectively — are currently displaying the unique and 
intricate creations that earned them their titles.
German’s work, titled 21st Century JuJu: New Magic, 
Soul Gadgets and Reckoning, explores the concept of 
souls. Her statement reads, “I am thinking about the 
technology of the Soul; how I might go into the inside of 
the inside of the inside, what I got to do to git there, and 
how I attend to what I ?nd [sic].”
Rooms feature statues of dark-skinned women, doll-like 
and eerie. Each ?gure possesses a presence and soul. 
Their attire is pieced together from an eclectic mix of 
odds and ends: Keys, light bulbs, animal statues, birds, 
mirrors, and pieces of Americana adorn the ?gures.
German’s work exhibits a strong commentary on the 
American experience, largely focusing on African-
American and black folk art. In one room, a large ring of 
14 statues adorned in American paraphernalia stare out 
past viewers. The ?rst ?gure visible from the doorway sits 
atop a table labeled “America,” with rusty nails jammed 
into its torso and holding an American ?ag handkerchief.
German investigates the pain and presence of American 
culture in her work, and succeeds in displaying a 
powerful range of emotions through her ?gures. The body 
of work was created with the intention of showing only 
what German loves to create. According to her statement, 
she asked herself the question, “What comes from my 
most innate, original places?” and worked forward from 
that point.
German is a self-taught artist who currently lives and 
works in Homewood. Her process involves a collection 
of old kitchen materials, domestic items, old tools, and 
objects that people use in everyday life.
Brodsky’s work, featured on the second ?oor of the art 
center, displays a more subtle approach to creation. Her 
work appears in book form, pairing photographs of her 
dog, Max, with the words of famous poets, artists, and 
authors. She displays seven handmade books featuring 
Max with the words of William Shakespeare, Fyodor 
Dostoyevsky, Mary Shelley, Samuel Beckett, and John 
Muir.
The pictures and text mix in a pleasant, slightly humorous 
nature. Max, a small West Highland white terrier, is 
considered the “actor,” taking on different roles in each 
of Brodsky’s photo books. In one of the books, where 
the photos are paired with passages from Shelley’s 
Frankenstein, Max plays the role of a monster. In another 
of Brodsky’s photo books, called Dual Tracks, he is 
featured as an urban escapist, paired with lines from 
Muir.
The large prints of Max paralleled with the philosophical 
writings that Brodsky chooses gives the little white dog 
an oddly human quality to him. What appear to be his 
heart-wrenching thoughts on life and his surroundings 
document him as an unspoken philosopher. For example, 
a print from one of Brodsky’s other photo books, called 
The Artist, matches a forlorn picture of the small dog 
in a deserted alley with painter Mark Rothko’s musing, 
“Silence is so accurate.”
Brodsky’s statement on her exhibit, titled Good Dog, 
begins with “I didn’t start out as a dog photographer.” 
This particular exhibit is her ?rst presentation of Max 
as her subject. A professor of photography in Carnegie 
Mellon’s School of Design, she pairs her photographs 
with famous writers “to get at the human condition,” she 
explains in the statement. “There is seriousness at its 
core, but there’s a lot of humor, too.” Brodsky’s past work 
has similarly focused on combinations of photographs and 
words, though largely in collaboration with other authors.

On learning music
Enjoying a new type of music is similar to learning a 
new language. Developing a functional knowledge and 
understanding a few key phrases isn’t that dif?cult, but 
attaining ?uency requires research, practice, and more 
time than one ?rst imagines. The key to both, however, 
is immersion. Surrounding yourself with people who are 
already familiar with the culture is the most ef?cient way to 
learn about any musical style.
You can try doing research on your own by reading 
Pitchfork or Drowned in Sound, sur?ng Wikipedia’s “list 
of X-genre artists,” and downloading a bunch of albums 
that you’ve heard belong in a certain genre, but this is no 
different from learning a language solely through how-to 
books and instructional podcasts. In other words, by 
learning this way, you lose the human aspect — the social 
nuances that elevate communication beyond simple 
information transmission into a form of spiritual connection 
and understanding.
There is another key similarity between learning a new 
language and broadening your musical taste: There is 
a critical period of acquisition, and once you pass that 
period, ?uency is much harder to acquire. According to 
Daniel Levitin, associate professor of psychology at McGill 
University, it is our music taste during our teenage years 
that most heavily in?uence our listening preferences as 
adults. While that critical period has already passed for 
most of us, there is still time to listen and learn.
Carnegie Mellon is one of the most diverse universities in 
the country. Our music program is world renowned, our 
radio station is one of the ?nal bastions in freeform radio 
culture, and Pittsburgh is a musical hotspot for most any 
type of style. So, why are you still reading this? Go ?nd 
something new to listen to and expand your mind.

Four Tet releases Pink
Club-friendly jams abound on the artist’s new album
Kieran Hebden, better known as Four Tet, is possibly 
one of the most exciting people currently making 
electronic music. Taking ideas from a vast array of 
musical styles such as free jazz, UK garage, house, 
and hip hop, Hebden molds compositions that feel 
organic, warm, and inviting, instead of throwing 
together a grab bag of mismatched styles and 
samples.
Listening to any of Hebden’s work makes it hard to 
overlook his origins as a member of the post-rock 
band Fridge. While his output as Four Tet would 
never be considered post-rock, it is perhaps the 
purest manifestation of the genre’s ideals: lush 
musical landscapes tethered by innovative uses of 
acoustic instruments and samples of nature that are 
emotionally striking and aurally stimulating. Four Tet 
is, in many ways, more post-rock than most post-
rock bands.
It is this entrenchment in organic production and 
lushness that makes Hebden’s new album, Pink, 
so dif?cult to digest. Upon ?rst listen, it is hard to 
believe that the same producer who released the 
gorgeous and divine-sounding There is Love in You 
two-and-a-half years ago could release the more 
cool, mechanistic, and club-oriented songs that 
appear on Pink. Only “128 Harps” and “Locked” are 
representations of the Four Tet sound prevalent on 
previous albums.
While there is a lot going on in “128 Harps” — 
drums, a wordless vocal sample, and harps mesh 
over the shimmering of a tambourine army — the 
song is surprisingly relaxed. While “Locked” sounds 
nothing at all like “128 Harps,” it also manages 
to sound very Four Tet; the disjointed drumbeat 
lopes on endlessly before synths gradually enter, 
culminating in a catchy, repetitious riff. The 
surprising inclusion of dubstep-in?uenced bass 
wobble, however, is what really sets the song’s 
momentum and signals its true nature, looping 
disparate instruments and styles against each other 
to form a harmonious amalgam.
The previously unreleased “Lion” also bears a 
surprising resemblance to Four Tet’s older material. 
The song starts off dominated by a stereotypical 
“uhn-tiss” dance beat with odd, almost yelping 
samples, and ends carried by a catchy thumb harp 
loop and synths.
This is not to say that all of the other songs are 
bad. “Pyramid” is essentially a more club-friendly 
“Angel Echoes,” with its looping vocal samples. 
“Jupiter” begins with moody and cold synths before 
launching into an upbeat drum loop anchored with 
grimey bass, climaxing with a simple but incredibly 
engaging vocal sample.
The only real dud on Pink is “Peace for Earth,” which 
is a failure both as a song and as a component of 
the album. Not only does the ambient soundscape 
chafe uncomfortably with the other songs, but it is 
also cheesy, predictable, and stumbles over the line 
between atmospheric and boring.
Pink isn’t really an album as much as it is a 
collection of singles; only “Peace for Earth” and 
“Lion” were not previously released. This isn’t a 
release targeted at diehard fans, who probably 
own all of the previously released singles already, 
or toward new fans, who will not ?nd much that 
represents Four Tet’s back catalogue. Instead, Pink 
is for the casual fan or the lazy diehard.

A compelling new documentary ?lm is headed for the 
Steel City. Married in Spandex — the entertaining story 
of a young lesbian couple’s quest for marriage — was 
produced and directed by two Pittsburgh natives, Allison 
Kole and Devin Gallagher. The upcoming Pittsburgh 
screening is shaping up to be an exciting one.
Married in Spandex is a 55-minute documentary 
recording the marriage of Amanda and Rachel, who are 
determined to make their wedding a memorable one. 
Although the couple’s home is in Philadelphia, they 
travel to Iowa in order to receive a marriage license. 
The journey is made more interesting by their choice 
of wedding ceremony: They are married by rapper and 
performance artist Leslie Hall while wearing spandex, 
as vaguely hinted at in the title. The entire ceremony 
is laden with unique perspectives and is almost 
unrecognizable as a wedding.
The documentary started out as a series of interviews 
that would be given to the couple as a wedding gift. 
Gallagher explained, “We initially thought about using 
the interviews as a wedding present, but the event 
kept growing and growing so we decided to invest in 
something bigger.”
“It all happened really organically,” said Kole, who 
is Amanda’s sister and was a maid of honor in the 
wedding. “[Amanda and Rachel] thought it was a great 
idea and that it would be fun. People relate to them and 
they wanted to show how everyone can be creative with 
their own wedding.... They trusted us and they enjoyed 
talking about what they were about to do.”
Although there are some ?at moments, this fast-paced 
?lm is quite entertaining. The interviews with friends 
and family scattered throughout provide a variety 
of perspectives on the women’s relationship and 
marriage. They also highlighted the dif?cult decisions 
Amanda and Rachel were faced with during this time, as 
the two women chose their love despite the dif?culties 
and opposition that came with it. Although Rachel’s 
parents did not accept her lifestyle, she refused to give 
up on the person she loved; for her, it is most important 
to love in spite of everything the world does to change 
her.
Aside from the extraordinary wedding, many interesting 
political issues are brought to light in the ?lm. 
Speci?cally, the viewer is reminded of the fact that 
marriage equality is something unheard of in certain 
states; this is the reason the girls travel to Iowa. The time 
and effort they put into receiving a marriage license that 
is not even valid in their home state is a truly remarkable 
testament to their love for each other.
“It’s a really personal story that can open up dialogue 
more than a dry political story can,” Kole said. “The ?lm 
isn’t necessarily that focused on marriage equality, but 
it is a bene?t to the movement and encourages people to 
openly talk about it.”
From the beginning, Gallagher said, “We wanted to tell 
the story of two women doing something unique.” And 
the two ?lmmakers did just that. Married in Spandex is 
a touching and entertaining story, and anyone with an 
appreciation for originality, fun, love, and spandex will 
certainly enjoy this documentary.

Married in Spandex will be screened on Sept. 7 at the

It has been a busy summer at the movies. Batman faced 
Bane, there was never only one Bourne, and somebody 
thought it was a good idea to remake Total Recall 
without Arnold Schwarzenegger’s trademark bravado. 
While Hollywood was busy raking in boatloads of cash, 
the last few months have delivered a few exciting titles 
that will likely show up during Oscar season. Moonrise 
Kingdom, Bernie, and ParaNorman are three summer 
?lms that are worth seeing and still playing at theaters 
in Pittsburgh.
Moonrise Kingdom
The latest project from cinema’s arch-hipster Wes 
Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life 
Aquatic), Moonrise Kingdom sees his unmistakable 
stylistic panache reach a new level. Moonrise attempts 
to understand the possibility of love between two 
adolescents, Sam and Suzy, who live on the ?ctional 
island of New Penzance.
The two run away from their families to establish 
a place for themselves — a place for love — 
disconnected from the mundane responsibilities of 
imminent adulthood. The ?lm revels in the twilight of 
awkward, deadpan delivery, reaching for gravity and 
naiveté simultaneously. For the ?rst time, Anderson 
reveals a preoccupation with spirituality, most evident 
in a collection of references, both visual and textual, to 
Noah and the Biblical ?ood. The soundtrack features 
music by Benjamin Britten and Hank Williams, 
coexisting harmoniously on Anderson’s island. Moonrise 
Kingdom is a hip fable that may be the best ?lm of the 
?rst half of the year.
Bernie
In another ?lm worth seeing, director Richard Linklater 
(School of Rock and Dazed and Confused) teamed up 
with Jack Black for a second time in Bernie. Black 
portrays a hyper-genial, ?amboyant funeral director 
who befriends and murders a bitter widow. Linklater’s 
relaxed charm is noticeable throughout the ?lm, lending 
lightness to some otherwise heavy subject matter.
His most impressive feat, however, is his use of mock 
interviews to twist the East Texas community into a 
Greek chorus. With so much surface nonchalance, it’s 
startling to see how much intimate psychology Linklater 
is able to draw from these townspeople. In addition, 
Black compensates for the numerous, near-unforgivable 
tragedies of his career (Nacho Libre and Gulliver’s 
Travels) with this deeply expressive investigation of 
emotional arti?ce.
ParaNorman
As Pixar dives into a series of sequels that suggest the 
end of a spellbinding dynasty, other animators are being 
afforded the opportunity to step up during this new era 
of digital animation. We were given the supreme Rango 
last year and this summer, from the creators of Coraline, 
we were presented with the stop-motion virtuosity of 
ParaNorman. The movie deals with a cast-out kid who 
is able to communicate with the dead. It’s a familiar 
story, but it delivers an extraordinary result. ParaNorman 
harbors astonishing force in both narrative substance 
and world building. Everything from the digital effects to 
the painstaking stop-motion precision is strong.
These three titles barely scratch the surface. If you’re 
trying to catch some other great summer ?lms while you 
still have free time, be on the lookout for Beasts of the 
Southern Wild, Red Hook Summer, Killer Joe, and Magic 
Mike — all outstanding efforts.

Imagine yourself fresh off the bus from Pittsburgh to New 
York. You have a bag of clothes and a bag of puppets, 
props, and makeup. It’s one week before you perform in 
the New York International Fringe Festival, the largest 
multi-arts festival in North America that features around 
200 shows in a two-week period.
This was the scene for a group of Carnegie Mellon 
School of Drama students as they took their show, 
Sheherizade, to New York for the festival.
“We were lucky we had a minimalist set and didn’t have 
too many props,” said Rodney Earl Jackson Jr., a senior 
musical theater major and the show’s producer, about 
transporting the show materials to New York.
Sheherizade began as a project for the School of the 
Drama’s Playground Festival last March. “We thought, 
‘We need to seize the day and take this opportunity 
that the School of Drama and Purnell has given us and 
do something,’ ” said Jackson of the decision to enter 
in Playground. Aidaa Peerzada, a senior acting major, 
wrote the play and the two assembled a cast and crew of 
students to help put on the show.
Directed by junior directing major Priscila Garcia, 
Sheherizade is a fresh take on a traditional “Arabian 
Nights” story. The play incorporates music, storytelling, 
puppetry, and dance to tell three stories of women’s 
strength and men’s challenges.
After receiving great reviews at Playground for its 
originality, the group decided to enter the show into 
the Fringe Festival. “We decided to just enter it and see 
what happened,” Jackson said. “And then sure enough, 
we got accepted.”
Sheherizade was, in fact, one of three shows created and 
performed by Carnegie Mellon students in this year’s 
Fringe Festival. Two other groups that also presented 
their shows at last year’s Playground made it through 
the Fringe Festival’s jury selection process and became a 
part of this year’s festival.
Inexperienced Love, one of the other Carnegie Mellon 
shows at the festival, is a musical written and composed 
by senior drama student Jacob Tischler. The musical 
tells the stories of three college couples as they discover 
the ups and downs of love. The musical comedy was 
directed by senior drama student Benjamin Viertel and 
produced by iLove Productions.
The third group of Carnegie Mellon students to take 
its Playground show to the Fringe Festival performed 
Behind the Badge, an autobiographical story of two 
police of?cers and their sons. The play was written by 
senior drama student Lachlan McKinney and recent 
drama alum Marrick Smith, both of whom grew up 
with police of?cers as fathers. The play’s entire creative 
team is comprised of Carnegie Mellon students and is 
produced by Iron Shirt Production.
The three groups have added to a long list of Carnegie 
Mellon students who have performed at the festival in 
years past. PigPen, a group formed at Carnegie Mellon 
in 2008, participated in the festival in 2010 and 2011, 
winning the highest honor for a play both years. PigPen 
was the ?rst group in the festival’s history to win two 
years in a row. Additionally, a Carnegie Mellon group 
called In The Basement Theater also attended in 2011, 
performing a piece called Chien de Moi.
Despite the number of students who complete the 
journey from Playground to Fringe, it’s not an easy ride. 
Taking into account travel expenses, rehearsal space, 
props, backdrops, advertising, and time commitments, 
preparing for the festival can take its toll ?nancially and 
physically.
That’s why the Sheherizade group decided to hire 
a team to help take some of the load off. To pay for 
everything, they created a Kickstarter page and raised 
$4,610 — $1,110 more than their goal. To prepare for 
their show, they rehearsed between six and eight hours 
every day for a week.
“It was really tiring,” Jackson said, “but absolutely worth 
it. I learned a lot about being a producer in the process.”
The main thing Jackson learned, he said, was that if you

want things to be done, you have to do them yourself. 
This was certainly the case for advertising the group’s 
four shows. Unlike campus performances, a full house is 
not guaranteed in New York, and especially not in the 
Fringe Festival.
“It’s a lot different because at school, you don’t have to 
worry about ?lling the house. The people who usually 
come, do come,” Jackson explained. “But in New York, 
there were 190-something shows in the festival, so it 
was all on you if you wanted people to come see your 
show. You had to go get them.”
In the end, Jackson and the rest of his team’s efforts 
paid off, as they performed to a large crowd and received 
positive reviews in the media.
Like Playground, the Fringe Festival allows students 
complete creative freedom. While Jackson enjoys the 
classical structure of school, “sometimes you want to do 
what you want to do, and [Playground and Fringe] really 
open that door for opportunity, which is phenomenal.”
“Fringe is like Playground on an escalated scale,” 
Jackson said. “It’s like, here’s the space, here’s the press, 
now you go and do everything.”

Comedian Charlyne Yi made a visit to Carnegie 
Mellon Friday night as part of the slew of activities 
planned for ?rst-years during this year’s Orientation 
week. Yi, whose performances focus on music, 
games, and audience participation, is known for her 
performance in her screenwriting debut Paper Heart 
and her role as Dr. Chi in the medical drama House.
Despite her list of impressive achievements, Yi’s 
show was fairly disappointing. Her stage presence 
was constantly lacking, and she relied heavily on 
multimedia clips and a notecard in her pocket. The 
clips she played ranged from boring to inappropriate, 
and her ?nal clip was offensive enough to send 
audience members out of Rangos Hall at record 
speed.
Some of the best laughs in Yi’s show came from her 
special guest, John the Psychic. John played well 
into the Carnegie Mellon dynamic and spent most 
of his short time in front of the audience asking 
questions and making sexually crude comments. 
Near the end of his segment, he went around 
Rangos pointing at various students, saying, “You’re 
a virgin ... and you’re a virgin ... and you’re a virgin,” 
until one student cheered in agreement.
Although both John the Psychic and Yi used crude 
humor for laughs, John seemed to be more in tune 
with the audience and was more entertaining.
Yi seemed to have a tough time capturing the 
undivided attention of the room because of her 
timid behavior, incessant use of the word “um,” 
and unclear plan for the show. Initially the audience 
responded to Yi’s act with appropriate laughter, but 
as the show continued, the audience seemed to 
grow bored of her routine.
After sharing her birthing video, one audience 
member shouted, “What the f***?” and Yi’s response 
was to laugh and exclaim, “Now you know where 
babies come from!” In the same vein, the students 
were the saving graces of Yi’s show, with their wit 
and occasional well-placed comments emerging 
from the otherwise silent crowd.
Toward the start of the show, Yi claimed her 
boyfriend had dumped her, so she was left looking 
for somewhere to stay, to which a male student 
shouted, “Hamerschlag!” This instigated cheers 
from the audience, even though the joke was 
completely lost on Yi.
After the show was over, AB Comedy Chair and 
senior economics major Bryan Wade commented 
on the possibility of students ?nding the show 
offensive, saying, “possibly, but it’s college.” Wade 
defended AB Comedy’s choice of comedians. “She 
has a kind of unique style appropriate for Carnegie 
Mellon,” he said.
Backstage after the show, Yi kept repeating, “I 
scarred everyone,” and, “I feel bad that people 
left.” When asked if most audiences respond to her 
birthing clip in a similar manner, Yi explained that 
reactions to the clip are very mixed, and that in Los 
Angeles she usually follows up the clip with a piece 
on the harp to help the audience mellow back out, 
but here in Pittsburgh, she had no such harp.
While not a complete disappointment, Yi’s show was 
dif?cult to connect with and seemed unorganized. 
Many individuals found her offbeat humor 
entertaining, but the audience as a whole seemed 
unimpressed with her performance.

An editorial discusses the importance 
of Freshman Camp (i.e. Orientation) 
and of keeping alive the “new outlook” 
and “enthusiasm” that first-years bring 
to campus. The article suggests that 
the camp be a graduation requirement. 
This editorial makes you wonder 
how long the student body has been 
apathetic in terms of school spirit.

A snarky feature recounts the 
“spectacles” witnessed during 
registration for the fall semester. In 
addition to the usual long lines, the 
administration added a “Popular Music 
Video” twist to the annual ordeal. 
Students received add/drop slips while 
songs like Janet Jackson’s “Nasty Girl” 
played in the background.

Three students sue the university 
after they were punished for allegedly 
harassing art major William Kofmehl 
— also known as “Lobster Man.” 
Kofmehl became Lobster Man for a 
performance art project in which he 
dressed up as a lobster, took a vow 
of silence, and lived in a shack on the

A Pillbox article notes how to 
inexpensively decorate your dorm 
room. Some suggestions include 
making a collage out of newspapers 
and magazines or using comics as 
wallpaper. In addition to décor advice, 
the author notes locations around 
campus where students can print in 
gloss and color.

The Fence is vandalized for the second 
time this year. In addition to a message 
stating, “Hey CMYou you are a babe! 
NOT... Just kidding or am I? Now 
get back to studying...weirdos...” the 
fence also appeared to have been cut 
into with a hacksaw in multiple areas, 
slicing off some layers of paint.
